C. MAssEY.\nIn his opening address at the first general meeting of this Society,\nthe President, Professor Sidgwick, while expressly evading \"the diffi-\nculties of detennining in the abstract what constitutes adequate\nevidence\" of the phenomena called Spiritualistic (as well as of thought-\nreading and clairvoyance) nevertheless concluded with the following\ngeneral statement of the sort of proof at which we .ought to aim.\n\"We must drive the objector,\" he said, \"into the position of being\nforced either to admit the phenomena as inexplicable, at least to him,\nor to accuse the investigators either of lying or cheating, or of a blind-\nness or forgetfulness incompatible with any intellectual condition except\nabsolute idiocy.\" 1\nAs I am about to maintain that much of the existing evidence for\nthe phenomena in question already places objectors in the dilemma\nthus succinctly indicated by Professor Sidgwick, I must ask leave to\npoint out, with some approach to particularity, how, and under what\ncircumstances, I conceive the dilemma to arise. This is the more\nnecessary, because it will have at once occurred to all of us that the\ndileIDIna does not arise in the case of conjuring tricks, to which the\n1 Proceeding6.

[July 5.\nphenomena we are considering are usually referred by the incredulous.\nNo one thinks the worse of his own or another's intelligence for not\ndiscovering a conjurer's trick; but most of us would feel ashamed of\nmistaking a conjurer's trick for a genuine manifestation of an unknown\nforce. Nor is there, so far as I am aware, any mediumistic phenomenon\non record which absolutely defies simulation under all circumstances\nand all conditions of observation. The whole evidence is a question of\nthese circumstances and conditions. and to demonstrate that a conjurer\ncan bafBe observation under inferior conditions of these phenomena is\nquite beside the mark. We have to judge the evidence, as to answer\nan .argument, at its best. The success of the conjurer with even the\nmost intelligent spectators. depends on their overlooking the true. con-\nditions of the performance, and this again depends on their attention\nnot being directed to the particular operation which decides, or is the\ncondition of, the result. Any spectator who knew ea:actly what to\nobserve would have already discovered the trick, and a very little\npractice in observation would enable him to detect the actual tour tU\nforce by which it was accomplished. This remark, of course, does not\napply to the secrets of machinery, or elaborate scientific apparatus, and\nit is perhaps true that pseudo mediums and thaumaturgists have availed\nthemselves of such mechanical means. But none of the phenomena\nrelied upon by Spiritualists and the maintainers of a psychic, or nerve.\nforce are at all explicable by contrivances which could bafBe the well-\ninformed observation of even an adept. If the medium is a conjurer,\nhe may, of course, have some simple preparations, but to bring them\ninto play he must succeed, as other conjurers do, by the ignorance of the\nwitnesses of the particular thing to be done, on which all depends. By\nthis particular thing I mean, as will appear when we come to consider\nthe opportunities of a conjurer at a mediumistic sc!ance, one definite act\nor operation which, under the circumstances of the experiment, haa\nbecome the indispensable condition of the conjurer's success. In an\nordinary conjurer's performance this never is known, and observation,\ntherefore, wavers and is distracted by this uncertainty. The moat\nimportant thing is, perhaps, just what never would occur to the mind\nas important at all. I shall endeavour to show (1) that at mediumistio\nsittings. under the best conditions. this uncertainty does not and cannot\nexist; and (2) that even inferior powers of observation, equipped with\nknowledge of the exact thing to be observed, and associsted with\naverage intelligence, are competent to bafBe any conjurer in the world,\nprovided only that the conditions of observation are physically easy.\nThere must be sufficient intelligence to know that a conjurer's sole\nchance in that case lies in the possibility of withdrawing your attention\nfrom the single perception required of you. Very little will is required\nto be secure against this, because a domina~itizid~~hf for a\n\f1886.] The P088ibilities of Jfal-Ob8ervatWn. 7'1\nmoment in abeyance, is immediately re-excited by any foreign action,\npossibly designed to lay it completely asleep. This especially applies,\nas I know by my own experience in the slate-writing sittings, to offers\nof converaation, changes of hand induced by fatigue, and so forth j\njealous vigilance is aroused by the smallest modification in the\nconditions.\nIn the June number of our Journal, only issued a few days ago,\nMrs. Sidgwick takes up a position apparently opposed to the reception\nof general testimony of these phenomena, so far as they occur in the\npresence of professional mediums, and must be established by obser-\nvation of any degree of continuity. This is a plain issue, and one on\nwhich it behoves us to have a clear opinion.\nNow there is one broad distinction between the medium and the\nconjurer which ma.kes it possible to get evidence with the one which\nthe performances of the other can never afford. On the hypothesis of\nmediumship we should expect to be able to reverse one essential\nrelation of conjurer to spectator, so that the latter shall be no longer a\nmere observer or looker-on, but shall be himself the principal actor in\nall the preparations, while the physical activity of the medium is\nreduced to the minimum. The conjurer can only mask his essential\nperformance by his incidental and apparent performance. By this\nactivity he obtains two indispena&ble advantages. For, first, he\nimposes on the spectator a multitude and succession of observations in\nuncertainty of the precise essential point to which attention should be\ndirected to prevent or detect trickery. And, secondly, he is enabled\nto distract attention, or to impose inferior or impossible conditions of\nobservation with regard to the particular operations which have to be\nconcealed. We may, therefore, be quite sure that in order to baffle a\nconjurer it is only necesB&ry to undertake all preliminary manipula-\ntions ourselves, and so to make our arrangements that mere observation\nhas only to be directed to a single fact of sense perception, or at most\nto two or three such facts well within an average capacity of\nsimultaneous or successive attention j and, further, that the conditions\nof this observation should be the easiest possible. If, moreover, we\ncan reinforce the confidence which everyone must feel in his own senses\nup to a certain point by adequate contrivances to dispense with actual\nobservation of any important particulars, we shall reduce the problem\nto the most extreme simplicity that human experience admits of. For\ntestimony to phenomena obtained under such conditions to be of the\nhighest evidential value, it is only neceBB&ry that the witness should in\nsome way assure us that the observation, thus simplified and directly\ndesignated by the preparations, was in fact made, or that when this\nassurance is not explicitly given, it is only because failure of the\nobservation, under the circumstances, would have been !D.consis~nt\nDigitized by ~oo81e\n\f78 The Po88ibilities of Mal-Observation. [July 5,\nwith a sane and waking condition. If there is any possibility left for\nobservation to guard against, we m11St be satisfied that it was either\nsuch as could not have escaped attention, or one to which attention WIJ8\nactually directed. In that case, he only can question whether observa-\ntion has really performed its office who doubts the capacity of the\nhuman mind and senses to take in the most elementary facts of\nperception.\nNow I submit that testimony of this highest value exists, and exists\neven in abundance. But it will be perfectly idle to adduce cases in\ni1111Stration of this proposition, if every case in which the evidence is\napparently free from. defect is assumed to be incorrectly described.\nThat is the assumption which Mrs. Sidgwick is prepared to make,\nbecause in her view observation is defective, not only in what it\nomits, but in what it seems to assert.l I shall presently endeavour\nto show that this can only be true of general statements which\nfail to discriminate the elements of an observation, and which\nunder the name of observation give us only a mental result instead\nof testifying to individual and indivisible acts of perception. And\nas to important elements which are assumed to be lost for\nobservation, we shall have to see of what nature they must be,\nof what character and dimensions--in order that they may affect the\nresult. And then the appeal must be to universal experience of the\ndegree to which the senses can and cannot be stimulated by external\noccurrences without arousing attention suffi.cient for lively perception\nwith notice by a waking man. It is true that mental preoccupation is\npro tanto sleep in regard to everything upon which the mind is not\nactually engaged, and this preoccupation it is which the conjurer is\nsupposed to induce. But it is always the nature of the particular\nact in each case to be performed by the conjurer unobserved,\nwhich must determine the degree of preoccupatiou in the witness\nnecessary for the accomplishment of the former's purpose. Now,\nas regards this, if the l'ontive observations of the witness respecting\nthe physical conditions are generally trustworthy, we get thereby a\nmeasure of the conjurer's indispensable physical interference, and thus\nof the degree of stimulation to the witness's senses by such interference.\n1 .. The juggler's art consists largely in making things appear as they are\nnot. Can we suppose that it has caused facts which did not occur to be\nima,\u00a2.ned, and facts which did occur to be overlooked, to the extent required to\nmake the cases before us explicable by ordinary human agency!\" (J01,rttal\np. 332.) As Mrs. Sidgwick has .. no hesitation in attributing the performances\"\n(those with which she was dealing) .. to clever conjuring,\" though she says that\n.. certainly some of the phenomena (U ducribed seemed to be inexplicable by the\nknown laws of nature,\" this p08itive conclusion evidently requires the poBitive\n&88umption of mis\u00b7description.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f1886.] The P088ibiUtieB of Mal-Observation. 79\nIn proportion to that stimulation must be the degree of preoccupation\nfor observation to fail. 80 that it will not do to urge the abstract truth\nor experience of the liability of the mind to momentary preoccupation\nduring a prolonged observation: we must in each case compare the\ndegree of preoccupation supposable with the degree that is then and\nthere requisite for the conjurer's purpose. And here the appeal must\nagain be to common experience.\nHaving regard to the limits of our time, I am obviously unable to\ndo more on the present occasion than offer a few samples from the\nbulk, and even as to some of these I must content myself with a brief\nreference to the essential character of the evidence as illustrating the\npoints I have in view.\nNow I will first take two or three of the experiments devised and\ninstituted by the late Professor Zollner with the medium Blade, select-\ning the briefest suitable accounts that I can find. The following will\nbe found at p. 39 of the translation entitled TramcendeneaZ Phyric,.\nZOllner says :-\nI took a book-alate, bought by myself j that is, two alates connected\nat one Bide by Cl\"08II-hinges, like a book, for folding up. In the\nabsence of Slade, I lined both alates within, on the sides applied to one\nanother, with a half-aheet of my letter-paper, which immediately before the\nsitting, W88 evenly spread with lamp-black lOOt. This slate I closed, and\nSlade consented to my laying it (which I had never letoutof my handsafterI\nhad spread the soot) on my lap during the Bitting, so that I could continually\nobserve it to the middle. We might have sat at the table in the brightly-\nlighted room for about five minutes, our hands linked with those of Slade\nin the usual manner aboDe the table, when I suddenly felt on two occaaiona,\nthe one shortly after the other, the slate pressed down upon my lap, with-\nout my having perceived anything in the leaat visible. Three raps on the\ntable announced that all W88 completed, and when I opened the alate there\nW88 within it, on the one aide, the impreaaion of a right foot, on the other\naide that of a left foot.\nAnd this was just what Zollner had himself desired with a view to\nobviate possible objections to a similar phenomenon obtained pre-\nviously under inferior conditioDL\nNow I submit that this experiment reduces the supposition of maI-\nobservation to the extreme of absurdity. It would appear from the\naccount that the experiIr1ent was proposed to Blade only immediately\nbefore it was tried, 80 that there was no time for the preparation by\nSlade of a slate to be substituted for Zollner's. But as we are now on\nthe point of observation, I will suppose for the moment that possibility.\nIt will then be seen that Zollner's statement expressly excludes the possi-\nbility of a substitution bifore he placed the slate on his lap, 80 that Blade\n'Would have to effect it with his feet afterwards, and that though the slate\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f80 The P088ibilities of Mal-Observation. [July 5~\nwas all the time partly in Zollner's view, and when the least sensation\nwould have instantly drawn his eyes to the spot.\nI pass to another case from the same source (p. 81).\nThe experiment, says Zollner, was as follows :-\nI took two banda out out of 80ft leather, \" oentimiltree long (about\n15 inohes) and from five to 10 millimiltres broad (1 to f inoh), and fastened\nthe enda of each together, and aealed them with my own seal. The two\nleather banda were laid separately on the card-table at whioh we Bat j the\nseals were placed oppoeite to one another, and I held my band. over the\nbanda (ulhown in the plate). Slade Bat at my left side, and placed his\nright band gently over mine, I being able to feel the leather undemeath all\nthe time. Presently, while Slade'. banda were not touching mine, but were\nremoved from them about two or three decimiltres (from eight to 12\ninches), I felt a movement of the leather banda under my banda. Then\ncame three raps on the table, and on removing my hands the two leather\nbanda were knotted together. The twisting of the leather is distinctly seen\nin the plate, copied from a photograph. The time that the banda were under\nmy banda wu at mOlt three minutes. The experiment was in a well-lighted\nroom.\nHere the arrangements had reduced the office of observation to the\nsimple points (1) whether the banda lying before his eyes on the table\nwere in fact connected at the moment Zollner covered them with his\nhanda; (2) whether Slade could and did touch them when they were\nthus covered; (3) whether Slade could or did either knot them at the\nmoment Zollner removed his hands, or then substitute others for them.\nIf anyone thinks that either of these things could have happened un-\nobserved, I can only say that I am sure he will not get any honest\nconjurer in the world to agree with him.\nThe following fact, from my own experience with the same medium,\nSlade, may be fitly adduced here.\nIt was in New York, on the evening of the 14th October, 1875,\nand was publicly recorded by me shortly afterwards, from notes taken\nimmediately on my return to my hotel after the sitting. And my\nrecollection of it is still perfectly distinct. It was at Slade's own room,\nbrightly lighted with gas. The floor was carpeted. We sat at a table\nin the centre of the room, three of us, Slade opposite to me, my friend\nColonel Olcott at the end on my left and on Slade's right. There was no\none else present. Slate-writing experiments were proceeding between\nOlcott and Slade, when a chair on my righe-at the end of the table\nopposite Olcott-was thrown down by some undetected force. I got\nup, felt round the chair for any attachments, and then,producing a tape\nmeasure I carried with me for the purpose of my investigation, I took\nthe shortest distance between the medium and the chair, as the latter\nlay upon the floor. It was just five feet, and on resuming my seat I\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f1886]. The Possibilities of Mal-Observation. 81\ncould see a good clear space between the table and the prostrate chair.\nMeanwhile, Slade had not moved from his seat, and I requested him\nnot to stir, and asked that the chair, which lay on my right, and which\nI could watch as nothing intervened between me and it, might be picked\n'Up and be placed by 1M. There was an interval of perhaps two minutes,\nduring which time the medium, still engaged with Colonel Olcott,\nremained seated in the same position, as I know, because my range of\nvision from where I sat took in the whole general situation, though,\nas the prostrate chair and the free space of floor between it and the\ntable were the main things to be observed, I kept my eyes steadily in\nthat direction, and never lost sight of chair and floor for a moment.\nSuddenly I saw the chair move along the ground a few inches towards\nme, and in a direction slightly oblique to the table, and then, as I\nwatched it and the open space between it and the table, medium, and\neverything else, it was jumped upon its legs and deposited at my right\nside, just as if some one had picked it up in order to take a seat beside\nme. No mediumistic phenomenon that I have witnessed has made\nstronger or more lasting impression upon me than this one.\nOn another occasion I was sitting alone with Slade in bright daylight,\nwhen his chair was drawn suddenly and considerably back, with him\nupon it. I at once pushed back my own chair from the table so as to\ncommand a full view of Slade's whole person. I then asked that my\nchair, with me upon it, might be drawn back. This was done almost\nimmediately, to the extent of two or three inches. There could be no\nquestion either of Slade's agency in this, or of any unconscious action\nof my own, as I could, and did, see Slade from head to foot, and there\nwas no time for gradual tension of the muscles of my own legs and feet\nagainst the floor in analogy with the process which no doubt often\noccurs in table-turning or tilting with contact of hands. I could\nmultiply instances from my own experience in which observation has\nbeen similarly simplified and facilitated. When this is the case-and\nit will be found to be the case in a very large number of records-I\ncontend that it is perfectly indifferent whether we are experimenting\nwith a professional or with a private medium; and that the largflRt\nmargin we can rationally allow for unknown possibilities of conjuring\ncannot prevent the issue being reduced, as is desired, to one simply of\nthe veracity of the witness.\nI must, therefore, take exception to the statement of Mrs. Sidgwick,\nin the paper read at our last meeting, that the evidence is \"so seldom\nexperimental; that is, that the observer so seldom knows beforehand\nwhat will be the precise phenomena and conditions.\"l The precise pheno-\n1 Abstract of Mrs. Sidgwick's Paper in the May number of the Journal.\nI had not before me the full text, now published in this volume.

The only variation is in\nthe possibility of imposing tests supplementary to ocular observation,\nand these usually originate with the observer himself. I may instance\na case recorded only the other day (Ltght, May 22nd), in which the\nobserver, Major Ie Taylor, went three times to Mr. Eglinton, each\ntime obtaining the writing under a new test premeditated by himself.\nHe did this on the very principle recommended by Mrs. Sidgwick, of\nallowing a very large margin for conjuring and for defects of observa.-\ntion. As to the conditions of observation, they are known beforehand\nin all those cases and very numerous they are-in which the pheno-\nmenon is obtained under conditions of observation prescribed by the\nobserver himself. In Zollner's above cited cases (and others could be\nadduced from his book) phenomenon, test, and conditions of observa-\ntion, were all prescribed by himself. In both my cases of the chairs\n(especially the first mentioned) the phenomenon was prescribed by\nmyself, and, equally in both, the conditions of observation were the\nbest conceivable, because the very simplest. Mr. Eglinton's mediumship\nis especially remarkable for successes obtained under tests and conditions\nimposed by observers. In addition to Major Ie Taylor's case, may be\nmentioned, as illustrations, several others with this medium. Thus, on\nJanuary 5th, of last year, Mr. D. H. Wilson, M.A., goes with his wife\nand sister to Mr. Eglinton-these four being the only persons present.\nMr. Wilson suggests obtaining by psychography an extract from a\nclosed book.\nAccordingly (he Ia)'ll) Mn. Kimber (hie aister) wrote on a alate the\nnumber of a page; Mrs. WilBon the number of a line, and it remained for\nme to choose the book from which Mn. WilBon'a line of Mn. Kimber'a page\nwas to be written by psychography on the alate. For this purpose, with\nclosed eyes,1 I took a book from the medium'a shelves, which held about\n200 volumes. A crumb of pencil waa placed upon the alate, on which Mrs.\nKimber and Mn. WilBon had written the number of the page and line\nrespectively. A second alate of exactly the same aize and form was placed\nover this one, and the book waa put by myself on the top of the two alates.\nMr. Eglinton and Mrs. Kimber rested their hands on the book.\nIt ahould be noted that :-\n1. Precaution had been taken that no one besides Mrs. Kimber knew\nwhat number she had written on the alate to expreB8 the page to be rec.ted,\nthe same being true of the number Mn. WilBon had written to expreBS the\nline of that page.\n1 The experiment waa partly devised to test the presence of an intelligence\noutside the minds of all the sitters.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f1886.] The P088ibilities of Mal-Observation. 83\n2. The Blates and book were all on the top of the table immediately\nbefore the eyes of all present. (The Bitting wu by daylight.)\n3. The medium did not touch the book until the moment when he and\nMrs. Kimber rested their handa thereon. It had been handled by myself\nalone.\nAfter the lapse of a few aeconda the BOund of writing wu heard\nwithin the Blates. Upon the uaual aignal of three raps (alao seemingly\nwithin the slates) to indicate the end of the experiment, 1 examined the\nala.tea, and found the following sentence, written on the under one, with\nthe pencil resting on the full sOOp at the end. (I may mention that all the\nwritings throughout the entire ~ance were conacientioualy punctuated, and\nthat every t wu croaaed and every i dotted.)\n\"Page 199, line 14, is a table, the Jut word is '0'.\"\nMrs. Kimber had written 199, and Mrs. Wilaon had written 14.\n1 then opened the book (GhoIe'.

Maharaja Jotundra Mohun Tagore Behadur,\" &c.\nThe 14th line is u follows;-\n\" ShlkharbA.te, 24 Pargannaa, 210 0 O.\"\nNow though the form of Mr. Wilson's statement that the book had\nbeen handled by himself alone, before he put it on the slates as they\nlay upon the table before the eyes of all present, does not expressly or\nnecessarily import that it had never been out of his hands from the\nmoment he removed it from the shelf, I do not think anyone can\nseriously suggest that Mr. Eglinton had the several opportunities un-\nobserved:-\n1. Of reading page and line on the slate, although we are told that\nprecaution (very easy to take) was taken against this Vf!ry thing.\n2. Of getting possession of the book, opening it, and finding page\nand line.\n3. Of writing those 12 words and figures with their six t's and i's all\ncrossed and dotted on the slate.\nWere that possible, my own conclusion would be that human obser- ,.\nvation, under the simplest and easiest conditions, and with attention\ndirected to the self-devised tests to be guaranteed by the observation, is\nabsolutely worthless for any purpose and under any circumstances\nwhatever. And I would here refer to the sensible remarks of Mr. G.\nA. Smith, upon a similar experience of his own with Mr. Eglinton,\nwhich will be found at p. 301 of the Journal.\nOther investigators with Mr. Eglinton have obtained tests similar\nto the above, with variations devised by themselves, making the\noperations to be performed unobserved by the medium still more com-\nplicated. I will only here refer to the experiment recorded by Mr. J.\nS. Farmer and Mr. J. G. Keulemans in Light of October 17th, 1885.

After describing the cord,its dimensions, mode of knotting,\nand sealing the ends, &c., ZiSllner says: \"The above described sealing of two\nsuch strings, with my own seal, W88 effected by myself in my apartments, on the\nevening of December 16th, 1877, at nine o'clock, under the eyes of several\nof my friends and colleagues, and not in the presence of Mr. Slade.\nTwo other strings of the same quality and dimensions were sealed by Wilhelm\nWebber with his seal, and in his own rooms, on the morning of the\n17th of December, at 10.30 a.m. With these four cords, 1 went (17th\nDecember) to the neighbouring dwelling of one of my friends, who had\noffered to Mr. Henry Slade the hospitalities of his house, 80 88 to place him\nexclusively at my own and my friend's disposition, and for the time withdraw.\ning him from the public. The ~ce in question took place in my friend's\nsitting-room immediately after my arrival. 1 myself selected one of the four\nsealed cords, and, in order never to lose sight of it before we sat down at the\ntable, 1 hung it round my neck-the seal in front always within my sight.\"\nThe knots were obtained in a few minutes, the seal and Slade's hands having\nnever been out of sight.

Slade wu about to take slate and pencil to ask\nhis \" spirits\" whether we had anything still to expect, when I wished to\ntake a. nearer view of the position of the round table lying, u I supposed,\nunder the card-table. To my and Slade's great utonishment we found the\nspace beneath the card-table completely empty. nor were we able to find in\nall the rest of the room that table which only a minute before wu present\nto our senses. In the expectation of its re-appearance we sat again at the\ncard-table, Slade close to me, at the same angle of the table opposite that\nnear which the round table had stood before. We might have sat about five\nor six minutes in intense expectation of what should come, when suddenly\nSlade UBerted that he saw lights in the air. Although I, u usual, could per-\nceive nothing whatever of the kind, I yet followed iIlvoluntarily with my\nimposed on him the tuk of \"continuous observation\" of them, and have COt&-\nooivablyafforded a conjurer an opportunity, we cannot put the supposed substi-\ntution bifO'l'e the experiment. But Mrs. Sidgwick's dUggestion that it may\nhave been afterwarda, i.e.,\" after the string wu taken off the neck again,\nperhaps while it was being arranged on the table,\" is equally inadmissible, (I)\nbecause we can say, with u near approach to certainty u poBBible, that the\npresence or absence of the four knots must have been ucertained at the moment\nof removal from the neck, or already before the removal, when the indication of\nSUCCeBB would inducean instant examination; and (2) because there is no interval\na.ssignable for\" continuous observation\" in the ucertainment of so simple &\nfact as the presence or absence of knots on a cord in a clear light, even if the\nfact had not been already !P.IIC8rtained by sight or touch before Zollner actually\ntook the cord from his neck. I confeBB it would not have occurred to me to\nanticipate such a suggestion u this. Nor can I see the least necessity for\nZOllner mentioning the fact of trials on previous days. He showed his own\napprecia.tion of that fact, and of the supposable poBBibilities consequent upon it,\nby the very precautions taken. Indeed, I think the fact of former trials still\nfurther evinces Zl:illner's extreme caution, since he would not trust to the strings\nalready used, but either sealed new ones,. or at least re-sealed the old, on the eve\nof the successful experiment. This circumstance, the then careful and elabor&fe\nsealing of the cords, even suggests that this particular precaution wu a new\none altogether, for which Slade would be unprepared, especially as ZOllner\nemphuises the fact that the sealing was performed in the absence of Slade.\nBut the evidence stands in no need of this inference, for the reuons already\nstated. Logically, there wu of course no obligation upon ZOllner to mention\na fact which it would be legitimate to suppose in criticising evidence of this\ncharacter, if the evidence did not expressly ezcl'llde it. The reader will judge\nwhether there is any opening for Mrs. Sidgwick's inference that the poBBible\nimportance of the fact had not occurred to Zl:illner, or whether her consequent\nUBumption that he may \"not only have omitted to mention, but failed to see,\nthe importance of even obvious precautions\" is u violent and unwarranted 811\nit seems to me to be. And I may here add the remark, that if \"continuous ..\nobservation means prolongedobservation, none wu necessary in this, u in ma.ny\notherliucceBBful experiments; whereu if Mrs. Sidgwick's definition refers to any\ninterval, however short, it would apply to all observation whatever, and the\nword \"continuous\" is misleading.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f1886.] The POBBibilitw of Mal-Observation. 87\ngaze the direction to which Slade turned his head, during all which time our\nhands remained constantly linked together on the table; under the table my\nleft leg was almoat continually touching Slade's right in its whole extent,\nwhich was quite without design, and owing to our proximity at the same\ncomer of the table. Looking up in the air, eagerly and astonished, in\ndifferent directions, Slade asked me if I did not perceive the great lights. I\nanswered decidedly in the negative; but as I turned my head, following\nSIade's gaze up to the ceiling of the room behind my back, I suddenly\nobserved, at a height of about five feet, the hitherto invisible table, with its\nlegs turned upwards, very quickly floating in the air upon the top of the card-\ntable. Although we involuntarily drew back our heads sideways, Slade to\nthe left and I to the right, to avoid injury from the falling table, yet we were\nboth, before the round table had laid itself on the top of the card-table, so\nviolently struck on the aide of the head, that I felt the pain on the left of\nmine fully four hours after this occurrence, which took place at half-past 11.\nBut I am not prepared to admit that it is neceaaary to have\nrecourse to exceptional manifestations, or even to manifestations under\nexceptional conditions of observation, to establish these facts in\nrational belief. With regard to psychography, for instance, I contend\nthat locked slates, tied up slates, folding slates, your own slates, slates\nabove the table when the writing is obtained, are all really dispensable\nprecautions. What we most require, in order to be secure that the\nessential facts are within the compass of our observation, and that\nobservation itself has not been distracted or relaxed, is that the\nphenomenon shall occur with simplicity and directness. If there is\ndelay with changes of conditions, you must regard every such change\nas the beginning of a new sitting, and make a careful re-examination of\nthe slates. If you do this effectually, not merely taking a careless\nglance to be able to say you have done it at all, the task of observation\nis thoroughly simplified under usual conditions. The following case\nfrom my own experience with Mr. Eglinton will show the extent of\nthe claim I make for average powers of observation as against the\npossibilities of conjuring. The sitting was on April lOth, 1884. I\nwrote the account of it in the evening of the same day, and it was\nreported in Light of April 19th. The only other sitter besides myself\nand the medium was one of our Vice-Presidents, the Hon. Roden Noel,\nwho fully corroborated my statement. We sat in broad daylight. We\nused Mr. Eglinton's slates, of which there was a pile upon the table at\nwhich we sat. I sat next to the medium, on his right, Mr. Noel was\non my right. Passing over some preliminary experiments, in which\nwriting in small quantities was obtained, I desire to challenge judg-\nment on the question of mal-observation in what follows, which I copy\nfrom my own report in Light:-\nMr. Eglinton now laid one of two equal sized slates (lM inalms.

I clasped the\nslates, my thumb on the frame of the one (i-inch), and three of my fingers,\nreaching about four incheB, forcing up the lower slate against the upper one\nWe did not hold the slates underneath the table, but at the Bide a little\nbelow the level. Mr. Noel was thUB able to observe the position. Mr.\nEglinton held the slates firmly together at his end, as I can assert, because\nI partiCUlarly observed that there was no gap at his end. I alao noticed his\nthumb on the top of the Blatea, and can 8&y that it reated quite quietly\nthroughout the writing, which toe heard alfOOllt immediately, and continuously,\nexcept when Mr. Eglinton once raised his hand from mine, when the sound\nceased till contact was reBumed.\nWe heard the Bound of writing distinctly, yet it was not, I think, quite\nBO loudly audible as I remember with Slade. When the three tapa came,\ndenoting that the\" meaaage,\" was finished, Eqlinton ,imply remot-ed hi. hatid\nfrom the aiatu, leati1111 th~ in my left hand, also quitting contact of his other\nhand with my left, I took oft\" the upper slate, and we 8&W that the inner\nsurface of one of them was covered with writing, 20 linea (118 WOrdB), from\nend to end written from the medium, and oue line along the Bide by the\nframe, and\" good-bye\" on the other Bide. The writing was in straight linea\nacroSB the slate, all the linea slanting from left to right. It begins about an\ninch from the top ; from the bottom it iB continued along one side (one line)\nand then there are three lines in the inch-deep Bpace at the top, written in the\nreverse direction to that of the body of the meaaage. The ability to produce\nthe writing in any direction is thus shown. The writing is fiowing, easy, and\nwith a distinct character, as of an educated penman. I took the alate away,\nwith me, and it is now in my po88e88ion.\nI am glad that I took this latter precaution, for a reason to be men-\ntioned. Everyone, I suppose, will agree that the production of all this\nwriting, as described, by the medium while we held the slates, was\nabsolutely and entirely impossible. The question is thus apparently\nreduced to the single point to which I wish to reduce it, whether such\naverage poweMl of observation as mine and Mr. Noel's would be 80\ndeceived as to make our statement that Mr. Eglinton, after enclosing\nthe pencil within the slates which we tJl.6n \"carefully assured\" our-\nselves were both quite clean on both surfaces, \"forthwith\" and \"without\nany previous dealing with them,\" presented those same slates to me to\nhold-whether, I say, our observation could be so deceived as to make\nthat statement inconclusive on that important point. But as it is\nimaginable that a thin sheet of slate, already inscribed on one side,\nmight be loosely fitted into the frame of one of the slates used, clean\nsurface uppermost, so as to fall into the frame of the other slate, written\nside uppermost, when the first was placed upon the second, it is\nfortunate that I was a.ble to exclude that sUlllleStion,m,...nw~on\n<>tlIgitized by CjU~(5''-\n\f1886.] The PoBBibilitie8 of Mal-Observation. 89\nof the slate on which the writing appeared, which, by-the-bye, was\nwrapped in paper, either by myself or by Mr. Eglinton-under my eyes,\nat my request, and carried away by me, immediately after we had\nexamined the writing, the sitting being then closed.\nThe above case, therefore, aptly raises a question which I think has\nbeen greatly confused by vague apprehensions of unknown possibilities\nof conjuring, apprehensions, I may add, not at all sanctioned by the\npretensions of conjurers themselves. So far as the art of conjuring\nrelies on the fallibility of observation, the success of the conjurer\ndepends on his being able to impose the conditions of observation at the\ncritical stage in his proceedings. For very simple observations, such,\nthat is, as are resolvable into two or three elementary acts of perception,\nare not fallible if these acts of perception are really performed. The\noonjurer has to prevent their being performed, while he deceives the\nmind into the impression that they have been performed. Under cer-\ntain conditions this is easy to him; whereas under conditions not\nimposed by himself it is totally impossible. Now in studying evidence\nadduced by others there is one sure test for determining whether the\nconjurer's opportunity is or is not excluded by the evidence-I mean in\ncases where the statements of the witness, if taken simply at their\n1J6\"bal worth, would sufficiently exclude all possibilities of conjuring. It\nis only the best testimony-perfect lwnesty of statement being supposed\n--of which the verbal or apparent worth is a true measure of its real\nworth. And the reason of this is that very composite facts are often\nnot analysed by the ~itness, and that an observation comprising several\ndistinct acts of sense-perception is stated generally, as though it were a\nsingle and indivisible perception. We have then imposed upon us as\nevidence a conclusion of the witness's mind in place of an observation\nof his senses. The proof is not then reduced, as we desire to reduce it,\nto a question of veracity. For this purpose we must have particularity\nof statement, evidence that the witness has himself analysed the observa-\ntion into the acts of perception constituting it, and that at the time of\nthe observation. But however people may unconsciously misrepresent\nor exaggerate--as undoubtedly happens-this innocent looseness or\ninaccuracy belongs only to general statements of matters of fact, and as\nsoon as the demand is made upon the witness for greater definitude,\neither at least a confessed lapse of memory exposes the worthlessness of\nthe evidence, or the latter degenerates into conscious mendacity. Much\nof the value of cross-examination in judicial proceedings, for instance,\ndepends upon the presumption that precise and definite misstatements\ncannot be bond fide. And the art of cross-examination-so far as this\nhas for its genuine aim the discovery of truth-largely consists in\nreducing a general statement to the particular ones which it really\ninvolves. Now a scientific statement of fact is such a statementras\nDigitized by ~008 e\n\f90 The PoBBibilities of Mal-Observation. [July 5,\nleaves nothing to be elicited by this sort of cross-examination. And in\nconsidering the evidentia.l value of the observations with which we a.re\nnow concerned, we have always to see if possibly essentia.l fa.cts in the\nnarration are ca.pa.ble of further analysis. The note of an un-\ncritical judgment, either in making or receiving statements which\nshould be scientifica.lly s.ccurate, is the unconscious presumption of the\ncomponent elements of the fa.ct stated, or to speak more a.ccurately, of\nthe severa.l facts of observation by which the resultant fa.ct is a.scerta.ined.\nI submit that we have here the whole secret of the possible success\nof a conjurer who is without confederates or artificial applia.nces. We\nhave at the sa.me time a sure test for determining the value of observa-\ntionswith professional mediums,who must continue underthe suspicion of\nbeing conjurers till these phenomena'are generally recognised, which will\nperhaps not be until the laws of their occurrence are a little under-\nstood. I therefore respectfully urge that the objection to rely upon\ninvestigations with professional mediums is especia.lly unworthy of the\nscientific spirit in which this Society professes to examine evidence. Our\nstandard should be the highest, our criticism the severest; but the best\ntestimony will leave no room for suggestions of mal-observation,and then\nit will only remain to see if, supposing the a.llegations to be strictly\nhonest, the fa.cts are still explainable by any recognised agency. We\nhave heard of the necessity of a.llowing a wide margin for unknown\npossibilities of conjuring, and that sounds plausible enough until we\ncome to ask what coniuring means, and must mean,. under the\nconditions of these experiments. We then see that the margin\nfor possibilities of conjuring is really a margin for possibilities of\nmal-observation. But when we get to the ultimate unit of observation\n-the indivisible, elementary fa.ct of sense-perception-mal-observation\nby the attentive mind is no longer possible, and testimony\nwhich shows that there existed a mental direction to these particul&l'S\nis testimony which excludes the margin for everyone who will not cheat\nhimself with words for the evasion of his critica.l responsibility. I am,\nof course, aware that what I have here ca.lled \"the indivisible,\nelementary fa.ct of sense-perception\" is further resolvable with regard\nto the primary functions of mind and sense; but for all that, the\nsimplest nameable fa.ct remains the starting-point of all experience, and\nillusion in experience begins with the mental combinations of which\nthat is the unit. For all mere illusion or misinterpretation in relation\nto this simplest element of experience-a.s when a rope upon the path\nis taken for a snake-- results from imperfect conditions of observation,\nor (what is the sa.me thing from the subjective side) frompre-occupa.tion\nof the mind by its own concepts. It follows that as long as the\nattention is given to an indivisible fa.ct under proper conditions of\nobservation, the conjurer's opportunity has n~~it~~(;cMr first\n\f1886.] The Pollsibilities of Mal-Observaticm. 91\nwith the opportunity of the observer's own mind for self-deception. And\nif the witness is strictly veracious, it is logically certain that his\nevidence will itself betray to the critical eye the point or points at\nwhich the conjurer's operations were possible, if possible they in fact\nwere.\nBut as general remarks on such a subject as the present require to\nbe illustrated, let us consider what may be supposed to happen on a\nparticular occasion, and what, in that case, an honest witness will and\nwill not say. Suppose that at a conjuring performance for the simula-\ntion of psychography, the conjurer has already succeeded in writing\nunobserved upon one side of the slate, and wishes now to makeyoubelieve\nthat both sides are clean before depositing the slate, with the inscribed\nside downwards, on the table, to be turned up when the phenomenon is\nsupposed to have come off in that position. Now, if at this critical\nmoment you do not prescribe your own mode of examination, either by\ntaking the slate in your own hand and turning it over, or by seeing that\nthe conjurer turns it slowly round before your eyes, he may be able, by\na little manipulation, aided by a little talking and delay, or with the\nassistance of another slate for purpose of confusion, to present the same\nside to you twice over and make you think that you have seen both\nsides. (This, I should say, is the explanation recently suggested by the\nfamous German conjurer, Hermann, of Berlin,l of the mod'U8 opera'lldiin\nsuch a case.) But if that were so, the witness could not innocently use\nterms ~l'!l and definitely inconsistent with what really happened ;\nhe could not, for instance, honestly say, as I said in the report\nI have read to you, that the medium did something \"forthwith,\"\n\" without any previous dealing with the slates,\" which the witness \"then.\ncarefully assured himself\" to be \"both clean on both sides,\" whereas\nit was in the very fact of delay, of previous dealing, and of neglect of\n\" careful\" assurance that the supposed medium has found his fraudulent\nopportunity. The honest witness could not so frame his statement,\nbecause, though he might honestly forget, he could not honestly invent\nSpecific and positive acts of perception, for the appearance of which no\nmental inference or interpretation could be responsible. But we have\nan instance-an actual instance-ready to our hands of how he mighe\nexpress himself in such a case.\nMrs. Sidgwick quotes accounts from a lady friend of hers of several\nco~iuring experiments in slate-writing as illustrating the fallibility of\n1 As this paper is going to press, I have received information that the\nHermann here referred to (author of the article in the German Sphi7Ul:, from\nwhich the above and a subsequent statement is taken) is not the true Hermann\nof conjuring renown, but only a manufacturer of conjuring apparatus. The\ntrue Hermann is said to be now in London and about to experiment with\nMr. Eglinton. Gooole\nDigitized by \"\n\f92 The Possibilit\u00b7ies of Mal-Observation. [July 5,\nobservation.! Now I think every careful reader of these accounts will\nbe struck by the abbreviated form of them, and by the frequent viola-\ntion of the canon of evidence above mentioned, namely, that a\ncomposite observation shall not be stated generally, as if it were a\nsingle and indivisible perception. We should want to cross-examine\nthis lady upon nearly every line of her statemf!nt in order to appreciate\nits evidential worth. But I will here confine myself to the single point\nof due examination of the slates in the experiment in which the writing\nwas apparently on one of the same slates of which the lady says: \" We\nexamined them when they were placed the second time on the table and\nsatisfied ourselves that they were clean.\" Continuous observation of\nthe slates after they were thus deposited the second time is not alkgecl\nnor is any interval of time stated. But assuming that one of the\nslates was then already inscribed,s everything depended on the observa-\ntion of their condition at that critical moment. Now you can only\nascertain that a slate is \" clean\" by successive examination of both its\nsurfaces, the evidence of which must, in the reasonable intendment of\nthe witness's language, exclude all possibility of deceptive manipulation\nby the conjurer while the surfaces seem to be displayed. Otherwise\nthere is nothing to show that the witness appreciated the prime\nimportance of this observation. And as it is perfectly possible for a\nconjurer under certain conditions, or if he is allowed his own way, to\nmake it seem to a spectator that slates are clean when they are not, so\nit is perfectly possible for an honest witness in such case to use this\nform of expression: \"We examined the slates and satisfied ourselves\nthat they were clean.\" But with every approach to definiteness and\nparticularity of statement, we approach the limit beyond which honest\nmis-statement is no longer possible. How these particular tricks were\nperformed exactly, I do not profess to know.s But so far as we have\n1 MI'II. Sidgwick's own observations on these OCC&Bions are not given in\ndetail in her paper. As the criticism of them I read at the meeting referred to\nan account she had sent me, and which I erroneously supposed to be part of her\npaper, that criticism is now omitted.\nt As is very doubtful upon the evidence, even without having to suppose\nsuch a failure of observation as would permit the writing to be performed after\nthe slates were dePosited. For there is no evidence that the slates then\ndeposited (the second time) were both the same slates afterwards ascertained to\nbe the lady's (\" Miss Z.'s \"). The\" message \" may have been written on one of\nher slates at an earlier period of the sitting, when the slates were under the\ntable, and when, as I learn from the account sent me by Mrs. Sidgwick, one of\n\"Miss Z. 's\" slates was for a time discarded, no observation. of it meanwhile\nbeing alleged. In that case, the substitution of the inscribed slate (\"Miss Z.'s\")\nfor one of those upon the table is easily supposable in the absence of any aver\u00b7\nment of continuous observation of them. It is jUBt Buch defects of testimony on\ntM face ofit, in the case of conjuring, which illustrate and confirm my argument.\na I had only the first case before me when my paper was written.

Now if the medium-conjurer\ncould confidently foresee at the beginning of a sitting either that he\nwould or could not get all the conditions required for success in the\nseveral successive operations he might have to perform, this privilege of\nfailure would no doubt be very advantageous. But in many cases,\nespecially in the slate-writing, the conjurer's conditions may break down\nat any point, and should strict conditions of observation be insisted\nupon at a late stage, no harmless failure, but exposure, must result.\nIf, for instance, we suppose that \"Miss Z.'s\" slate was already\ncontinuously under the hands of the whole party, or even that they seemed to\nbe continuously observed at all. Before we are called upon to criticise evidence,\nit must at least present a prima facie case for explanation. In the fourth case it\nwas \"Mr. A.\" who\" slipped\" the sheet of paper, on which the writing was\nfound, into the locked slate, and this appears to have been done after \"Mr. A.\"\nwas told the page and liue selected. I cannot agree with Mrs. Sidgwick that\nthis case \"is, perhaps, more surprising.\" (It will be understood that I do not\nattempt to exhaust the possible opportunities of the conjurer, with regard to\nevidence which seems to me so entirely lacking requisite exactitude and detail.)\nPassing to the account of the (other?) conjurer's performance in \"Mr. X.'s\" case,\nthe simultaneous use of two slates apart from one another offers us a rather easy\nexplanation without supposing lIuch a total abstraction of attention for\n\"two or three minntes\" out of \"some few minutes\" (the duration of\nthe whole experiment) as is suggested. We are told nothing of the\nposition of the conjurer's hands (a point seldom omitted in the mediumistic\nreports), and it is not difficult to suppose that by sUCC88l!ive feints he\ncould first excite \"Mr. X.'s\" suspicioDl! in relation to one slate, and then\nin relation to the other, thus getting him to fix attention on one at a time while\nthe other was being written upon. The\" whisking away\" of the slate held\nby c\u00b7Mr. X.\" was probably necessary on account of the writing having, under the\nconditions, to be executed on the upper surface and having to be made to appear\non the reverse. A still easier supposition would be that the writing was indeed\nthus performed- probably a very few wordll---On the held slate with a much\nshorter diversion of attention to the other one, and that the latter-the locked\nslate-was a trick slate with mCBl!age as described all prepared beforehand. A\nquite inexperienced observer with two separate objects to watch may easily be\nself\u00b7deceived as to continuous observation of both on one and the first occasion.\nBut a total abstraction of attention from a Bingle object, and that for two or\nthree minutes out of some few minutes, and with perfect ignorance of the fact,\nthe witnCBl! believing himself intent on observation all the time, could only\nbe abnormal. But that is what we should have to suppose in a large\nproportion of the genuine slate-writing s~ances, nay, that the same thing\ncould happen repeatedly, with experienced observers, and even with two or\nthree such observers at the same time!

So that\nthough now and then an ingenious profeBBional or amateur may succeed\nin one way or in another, repeated observations, reflection, and public\ndiscussion would soon lay bare all his resources, and there would be an\nend of him. The professional conjurer has a large repertory of tricks,\nand is constantly inventing new ones with all the aid which mechanical\nappliances, confederates, and his own stage, can afford. He can drop\na trick as soon as it is in danger of discovery, and vary his entertain-\nments indefinitely. The public go for amusement, and do not study or\nhear of the discoveries made by critical experts, by which the conjurer\nis soon warned off dangerous ground. Nor are professional experts\ninterested in exposing each other's performances, but in repeating them\nfor their own benefit; whereas against the medium they are all, with\na few exceptions, banded. The medium, on the other hand, is especially\ndeveloped for a comparatively few phenomena, which recur with him\nfor many years as the main feature and attraction of his mediumship.\nA certain proportion of his visitors are habitual students of the subject,\nwhose attention is open to every explanation that is put forward, and\nwho have the advantage of their own systematic observations with the\nsame and similar mediums. They are constantly obliged to defend\nthemselves from the charge of credulity and mal-observation; each time\nthey go to a seance they have the keenest inducement to obviate BOme\nobjection to their own or others' evidence, or to meet BOme more or less\npossible suggestion as to the modus operandi. They improve their\nmethods of observation, they direct it to fresh points, they devise and\nobtain new tests. Psychography alone has now been before the public\nof this country for 10 years. Some of the most famous conjurers, and\nmany acute minds have engaged in criticism of the facts and of the\nevidence, and yet it has survived the ordeal as no single trick, or varia-\ntions of a single trick, of such a character and under such conditions as\nthis slate-writing could possibly survive it.\nTo deal at length with general objections to the genuineness of\nthese phenomena is not within the limits of my present subject.

And there are features in this trickery which should make\nus look a little deeper than the conjuring and fraud theory for its ex-\nplanation.. Slade, for instance, now often cheats with an almost\ninfantile audacity and na\"ivete, while at the same or the next seance\nwith the same investigators phenomena occur which the most consum-\nmate conjurer might well envy. Then it is made an objection that tests\ndesigned to dispense altogether with observation in the presence of the\nmedium have not been obtained, although they could not be conceived\nto present greater physical difficulties to a genuine occult agency than\nthings actually done. There is in this a quiet assumption that we have\nnot here to do with independent wills and intelligences, or with laws\nother than physical, which is quite illegitimate at the outset of our\nresearches. But without having recourse to such suggestions, I need\nonly point out that if human observation under the easiest conditions is\nat all to be relied upon, the evidence can become perfect without these\ntests, and can only be illogically prejudiced by the absence of them.\nA third objection which weighs with many is the failure of\nmediums with some investigators who, of course, on that account\nare credited, if they do not credit themselves, with too much\nastuteness, and with too great powers of observation for the medium\nto venture on his tricks with them. It is a remarkable illustration\nof this theory that Mrs. Sidgwick, who tells us that personal\nexperience has made her form a very low estimate of her own as\nwell as of others' powers of continuous observation, and who failed\nto detect the opportunities of an amateur expert in slate-writing,\nalthough she knew that a trick was to be performed, is one of\nthose with whom that accomplished conjurer, Mr. Eglinton, has\nbeen uniformly compelled to exercise his \"privilege of failure.\"\nIt is another commentary on this view that I myself, and others\nupon whom Mr. Eglinton has found it very easy to impose, have\nhad with him as many failures as successes, under precisely the same\napparent conditions in both cases. The causes of failure as of success are\nat present too obscure for such arguments to be other than prejudicial\nand opposed to the scientific character at which we aim. No doubt it\nis a disappointment-and perhaps no one has felt that more severely\nthan myself-that some of the most distinguished members of this\nSociety have failed to obtain evidence through Mr. Eglinton. But we\nmust remember the idea with which we started, and which was so well\nexpressed by Professor Sidgwick in his first address to us. It was\nnever supposed that these phenomena had the scientific character of\nDigi\n\f96 The P088ibilities of Mal-Obaervati<m.

We were to accumulate testimony,\nto overcome opposition by the gradual accession of witnesses of good\nintelligence and character. There was no necessity for that if we\ncould say to all the world-go to this or that medium and we guarantee\nto you personal evidence. The physicist does not rely upon testimony\nor ask others to rely upon it. But we pre-suppose that the phenomena\nwith which we deal are not accessible to all.

I suppose\nthat would be disclaimed, but is it disclaimed in favour of &\ncriticism which discovers all other evidence to be bad, By further\nand further depreciating the powers of human observation, by more and\nmore magnifying the resources of conjurers, it is nearly always possible\nto suggest a chink or cranny for escape in this case, and another and\ndifferent chink or cranny in that. case. But the very object of accumu-\nlating evidence is to make such suppositions increasingly violent the\nlarger the area of experience which they have to cover, until the\nhypothesis of ma.l-observation becomes the last resort of those who will\nnot or cannot credit testimony until their own senses have had\n~ cognisance of the facts.

[July 5,\nfunctions of a society for psychical research, and I am not alone in\noelieving that we should have found our scientific reward in beginning\nwith a provisional faith in the material of our inquiries. In this\nregion the laws and conditions are still almost wholly obscure, but of\none thing in it we may be generally sure-that there can be no greater\nmistake\"than to investigate phenomena of psychical origin with a total\ndisregard of psychical conditions. We are false to our hypothesis if we\n, assume that adequate precaution against fraud is the prime condition of\nsuccess, and that beyond this it is only necessary to bring an unpre-\njudiced mind to the investigation. These are indeed indispensable con-\nditions, but there may well be other and more positive ones not less\nindispensable. If we entertain the hypothesis of mediumship at all-\n. and why else are we investigating7--it must mean for us something\nmore than that in the mere presence of certain persons certain pheno-\nmena may occur. A medium is not like a bar magnet which can and\nmust exhibit its special charactersistics under certain exclusively\nphysical conditions. It is antecedently probable that something more\nis required of the investigator than the attributes of a fair-minded\njudge-a co-operation, namely. which will be best if it include some\ncontribution of that unknown force on which the phenomena primarily\ndepend, but which shall at any rate favour, and not repress, the\ndevelopment of that force in the medium. This sort of co-operation is\na mental disposition perfectly consistent with the most scientific vigi-\nlance, and which, in my own case, I have found even promotive of it,\nbecause I was well resolved not to be conducive to my own deception.\nIt would be strange if in this Society we were to ignore the proba-\nble application of telepathy to the phenomena now in question. For\ntelepathy in its principle must be far more than a mere emotional or\nideal transfer upon special occasion. The inter-action of our psychical\nnatures must be more intimate and influential than superficialconscious-\nness betrays. I once heard it remarked, jestingly orseriously-I hardly\nknow which-that the composition of an ideal circle for the investiga-\ntion of these phenomena would be a man of physical science, a pro-\nfessional conjurer, a detective policeman, and an Old Bailey barrister.\nThat suggestion represents the spirit which brings failure, and must\nbring failure, to every investigation of this character. And if you as\na society wish for useful original research by your own agents, you\nmust not choose your agents upon that principle. They must be\npersons thoroughly impressed with the great importance of exact obser-\nvation and exact statement, but who combine with these pre-requisites\nsome positive experience and some reasonable regard to the hypothesis\non which you are investigating at all.\nBut original research is not necessary in the first instance. Many,\nof whom I am one, are of an opinion that the case fnrtb~benomena\nDigitized by~UV'(5.e\n\f1886.] The P088ibilities of MaJ,..Observation. 99\ngenerally, and for \"autography\" in particular, is already complete.\nAnd probably many of yourselves are of opinion that the time has\narrived for your Literary Committee to deal with this question as it\nhas already dealt with other heads of evidence. It might begin with\nthe evidence of this \"writing at a distance.\" But unless it is to\narrive at a foregone negative conclusion, its judgment must not be\nguided by those who think: that human observation, with the most\nexpress direction of the mind, is not to be trusted to ascertain the\nfact that a slate has been untouched for five minutes on a table before\nthe eyes; or who are prepared, when they have before them exact\nstatements of facts of observation, to assume that the facts have\nbeen mal-observed and misdescribed. For that way lies interminable\ndoubt, and not progressive science.\nNOTE ON MR. MASSEY'S PAPER.\nIn the paper that precedes this note Mr. Massey refers to certain\nremarks made by me at the first meeting of our Society, in a manner\nwhich suggests that he has misunderstood their drift. If Mr. Massey\nhas misunderstood me, it is likely that others also may have done so:\nand since his comment on my present attitude is thrown in the form of\na reported question that challenges an answer, it seems convenient that\nI should at once answer him by explaining the phrases that have been\nmisunderstood. Mr. Massey begins his paper by quoting a sentence in\nwhich I described the sort of proof at which we ought to aim; he then\ngives several specimens of what he seems to regard as unexceptionable\nevidence for the genuineness of the physical phenomena of Spiritualism;\nthen, on pp. 95-96, he refers to me (correctly) as urging the Society to\naccumulate testimony, to overcome opposition by the gradual accession\nof witnesses of good intelligenceand character; and finally says, \" Seeing\nthat innumerable observations, by new witnesses of undoubted\ncharacter and intelligence, have accumulated since Professor Sidgwick\nfirst addressed us four years ago, it will be asked whether there was a\nmental implication in his words, so that the new evidence which was to\nsubdue the world must be that of himself and a few especial friends.\"\nMy answer is there was no such \"mental implication\";\nbut that the evidence which Mr. Massey a.ffirms to have\nbeen accumulated, and of which his paper contains examples, is not\nthe kind of evidence which I intended to urge the Society to accumu-\nlate. The evidence I had in view was evidence obtained in private\ncircles of relatives or friends, where no professional medium was\nemployed. That this was before my mind is apparent from several\npa.aaages of my address :--6.g., from the sentence precedins.\" the one\nDigitized by l:.~le\n\f100 The P08sibilities of Mal-Ob8ervation.\nfirst quoted from me by Mr. Massey; in which I say that\" it is due to\nthe private families or private circles of friends whom we hope to\npersuade to allow us to take part in their experiments\" that we should\nbring our evidence to the highest possible pitch of cogency.\nSo far as I know, there has been no important accumulation, during\nthe last four years, of the kind of evidence which I had in view: the\ntestimony of which Mr. Massey has spoken is testimony to marvels\noccurring in the presence of persons who exhibit them professionally for\nmoney. Now when I addressed the Society at its first meeting I\nintended to make it plain that we ought, in my opinion, to avoid paid\nmediums\" as much as possible\" ; I did not indeed think that it would be\nwise to preclude ourselves by a hard and fast rule from employing the\nservices of such persons: but I certainly hoped that we should be able\nto confine our investigation to phenomena\" where at any rate\"--as I\nsaid-\" no pecuniary motives to fraud can come in.\" It is, in my\nopinion, upon evidence of this latter kind that the prim4 f~\ncase for investigating the physical phenomena of Spiritualism\nmainly depends. Certainly, if we had nothing but testimonies to\nmarvels occurring in the presence of persons who charge a guinea. a\nseance for exhibiting them, I for one should never have thought it\nworth while to consider seriously whether such reported marvels were\ndue to anything more than skilful trickery on the one side and\ndefective observation and memory on the other. The testimony that\nexcited my interest in the subject was mainly testimony to pheno-\nmena occurring in private circles composed of persons who were very\nunlikely to have plotted to deceive each other or the public, or very\nnnlikely to possess a high degree of conjuring skill. There exists\nalready some noteworthy evidence of this kind-enough, in my opinion,\nto justify further inquiry, though not enough to constitute an adequate\nscientific basis for the momentous conclusion to which it points. I hoped\nthat the operations of our Society might be directed towards impro\"ing\nthe quality and increasing the quantity of this kind of testimony; and\nit was this hope that I intended to express in the address to which\nMr. Massey has referred.\nBut this is not all. The cases which Mr. Massey has brought\nforward do not merely exemplify a kind of experiment different from\nthat to which I announced that our Society's attention would in the\n'1n!,in be directed; they exemplify a kind of experiment which I hoped\nthat we should avoid altogether. The three persons through whose\nmediumship Mr. Massey's marvels are supposed to have been produced\nare not merely persons who make a trade of exhibiting phenomena: they\nare persons to whom imposture has been brought home by irresistible\npositive evidence. We learn from the SpiritualiHt (November 3rd,\n1876) that when Monck was charged at Hudder<:hlc:l At\\I'LR'j6 with\nIzed b~U,-,() C\"\"\n\f@ao P...wiIUiu of Mal-O_~ 101\nimposture under the Vagrancy Act, it appeared that conjuringapparatus\nhad been found in his room; and Mr. Henry Lodge and another well-\nknown resident in Huddersfield dtoposed on oath that Monck had\nconfessed to them that he practised deception on sitters. In the case\nof Slade, Mr. Massey himself adnlits that he \"now often cheats,\"\nthough he pleads that this cheating-when discovered-shoWB an\n\"almost infantine audacity and nalvete\" : for my own part, I cannot\ndoubt that Slade attempted to cheat me in 1876, in a manner which,\nthough \"audacious\" was not exactly \"naive.\" As regards Eglinton\n-if Mr. Massey has read the statements of Archdeacon Colley in the\nMedium and Daylwealc (November 1st and November 15th, 1878), and\nthe reports in the Spiritualiat (February 14th and March 21st, 1879),\nof statements by Mr. Owen Harries, he will scarcely doubt that Eglinton\nwas, BOme 10 years ago, engaged in the manufacture of spurious\n\" materialisationa\" with the aid of a false beard and muslin: a.nd I\nthink it clear that in 1882 Eghnton co-operated with Madame Blavat.\nsky in the production of a spurious Theosophic marvel.\nIf it had occurred to me, when I addressed the Society four years\nago, that we should be seriously urged to investigate the performances of\n\" mediums\" whose trickery was proved and admitted, I should certainly\nhave repudiated the suggestion with all the emphasis that I could\ncommand. But I then believed-and ventured to say-that Spiritual-\nists had been impressed by the \"evidence accumulated in recent years\nto show that at least a great part of the extraordinary phenomena\nreferred to spiritual agency by Spiritualists in England and America\nare really due to trickery and fraud of some kind.\" I hoped, iherefore,\nthat educated Spiritualists would generally agree with me in condemn-\ning what I called \"the obstinacy with which mediums against whom\nfraud has been proved have been afterwards defended,\" and in re-\ngretting that such persona should, as I said, \"have been able to go on\nwith their trade after exposure no less than before.\" I never thought\nthat we should be called upon to give direct encouragement to\nthis trade by undertaking a formal investigation of the \"phenomena'\"\nexhibited by such persona.\nH. SIDGWICK.\nFURTHER DISCUSSION BETWEEN MR. MASSEY AND\nPROFESSOR SIDGWICK.\nSince I have misunderstood Professor Sidgwick as to the ea:clt.l8iw\ncharacter of the evidence he proposed we should accumulate, I can only\nurge, after careful r&-peruaal of his first address to the Society, that I\nhad BOme excuse. For, in the first place, the suggestion in that address\nis not that we should \"confine\" our investigations to phenomena\noccurring with private mediums, but that we sh~~~ed'~y~e~l~\n\f102 The P088ibilities of MaJ,..Observation.\npossible direct\" investigation thereto. Secondly, Professor Sidgwick\nhad said in the same address :-\" I do not presume to suppose that I\ncould produce evidence better in quality than much that has been laid\nbefore the world by writers of indubitAble scientific repu~men like\nMr. Crooke&, Mr. Wallace and the late Professor de Morgan,\" and he\nwent on to urge that evidence of this superior quality should be accu-\nmulated. Now it is notorious that the authorities named appealed\nlargely and chiefly to evidence they had obtained through mediums\nwho, at one time or another, were professionals, and against BOme of\nwhom, moreover, acts of imposture have been alleged on apparently\natrong grounds. Then, again, when Professor Sidgwick said :-\" But\nwe can no longer be told off-hand that all the marvels recorded by Mr.\nCrookes, Professor Zollner, and others, are easy conjuring tricks, because\nwe have the incontrovertible evidence of conjurers to the contrary,\" I\nwas surely entitled to infer that evidence thus referred to--Professor\nZollner's being exclusively with Slade-was part of the primd faAa\ncase of the Society. There is nothing in the address at all suggestive,\neven, of the proposition that evidence with professional mediums can-\nnot be raised to a point at which suppositions of \"skilful trickery on\nthe one side, and defective observation and memory on the other\" would\nbring the investigator's intellectual condition within the description of\n.. absolute idiocy.\"\nIt is also allowable, I think, to refer to the facts that Professor\nSidgwick himself, and several other active members of the Society, have,\nsince the date of that address, made repeated attempts to obtain per-\nsonal evidence of the phenomenon of ' .Psychography\" with Mr.\nEglinton, and that several conjurers have been employed by or on be-\nhalf of some of these gentlemen to investigate with the same medium.\nI am quite unable to understand on what ground a conjurer could be\nemployed, if not the supposition that he might encounter conjuring.\nIt is also to be observed that .. conjuring\" and \"cheating\" are not\nconvertible terms. It is rather a strange inference that because a man\n\u2022has been detected in trickery he is therefore a consummate conjurer.\nAnd the known trickery of mediums is of such a character &8\nto raise no presumption whatever that they are conjurers. The\ntrickery has been most frequent in so-called materialisations, when it\nwas facilitated by the worst conditions of observation, and by the\nabsence of precautions against the introduction of disguises, &C. And\nwith all respect for Professor Sidgwick, I should say that if he\ndetected Slade in attempts to cheat him in the slate-writing,\nthe conjuring could scarcely have been of a high order, or such\nas (in his own words), .. conjurers cannot find out.\" The fact\nprobably is that conjuring, like other arUl, is rarely self-taught from\nthe first, but requires instruction by trainedD~g~~dt9~I~e early\n\fThe POBSibilities 0\/ Mal-Observation. 103\nantecedents of most of the better known mediums have been ascertained,\nand not only is there no trace of any connection with conjurers, but\nasuaIly their mediumship for the simpler-but not therefore easil1\nsimulated-phenomena has been observed in their childhood or very\nearly youth, before they could be credited with ability to carry out\nhabitual deceptions, and before the pecuniary motive could present\nitself. I may add that though Professor Sidgwick now rests his objec-\ntion to professional mediums chiefly on a presumption of their conjuring\ncapabilities, I find nothing of that in his first address, the preference\nfor private mediums being there put merely upon the absence of\nordinary~r at any rate pecuniary-motives to fraud. I have\nalways thought this a weak point in his position, if our aim is to obtain\nexact proof. There would be, I think, more force in his present objection,\nif (1) the presumption of conjuring ability were legitimate, which I\nbelieve it is not, and (2) if, admitting that presumption, it can in no\ncase be repelled by observations, or by precautions combined with\nobservation. My paper was an attempt to deal with this second\nquestion, and will no doubt be appreciated at whatever worth the\nargument may possess, in connection with Professor Sidgwick's state-\nment of his own position.\nC. C. MASSBY.\nIn pointing out Mr. Massey's misrepresentation of the drift\nof my remarks, I said nothing to imply that it was an inexcusable\nmisrepresentation. I had no wish to raise this personal question; but,\nas Mr. Massey has raised it, I may perhaps make my position-which\nhe still misunderstanda-clearer by answering it. I think, then, that\nMr. Massey was not justified in representing me as having tvrged the\nf.lCCUmtdation of the kind of evidence with which his paper deals-the\nrecords of the\" phenomena\" exhibited by paid mediums admitted to be\ntricksters-in the face of my distinct statement of opinion that we ought\nto work with private mediums\" It.8 much as possible,\" and my expres-\nsion of surprise at the encouragement given by Spiritualists to detected\nimpostors. But I quite admit that it was excusable in him to suppose\nthat evidence of this kind might have more weight with me than is in\nfact the case: for in the addre8B which he quoted, while I tried to\ntrace clearly the lines of investigation which our Society ought-in my\nopinion-to adopt, I intentionally left obscure my estimate of the value\nof the evidence that had already been collected. 1\\ly reason for this\nreserve will be readily understood. I was speaking as president of ..\nsociety newly formed by the combination of two heterogeneous elements\n-persons convinced of the genuinene8B of the alleged effects of spiritual\nor occult agency, and persons, like myself, who merelv tknnDh~thA\nDlgltlz~d by G~Oore-\n\f104 The Possibilities of Mal,-Observatw\",.\nevidence for their genuineness strong enough to justify serious\ninquiry. In this situation, I thought it my duty to lay stress on the\npoints on which-as I hoped-the audience I was addressing might\nagree, leaving in the background the points on which I knew that we\ndiffered. I hoped we might agree on the manner in which evidence\nwas to be collected in future; I knew that we differed on the value of\nthe evidence that had been collected in the past. Hence I expressly\ndisclaimed any intention of discussing the weight to be attached to this\nevidence; in speaking of the past I merely said on behalf of my new\nallies what might in my opinion be said with truth. They had been\nstigmatised as dupes of coarse and bungling tricksters; it seemed to\nme only fair to point out that some of the tricks had, at any rate,\nbaftled experts in conjuring. Taken alone, indeed, this fact would have\nseemed to me of little importance. I have no great difficulty in sup-\nposing that certain unscrupulous persons, skilful enough in certain\npeculiar kinds of trickery to baffle the insight of conjurers, find the best\nmarket for their skill in exhibiting their tricks, at a guinea a sMnce, to\nSpiritualists and investigators: at any rate, this suggestion is not so\nimprobable as to render it necessary to resort to the hypothesis of\nspiritual agency or occult forces in order to avoid it. But, taken in\nconnection with the testimonies to private mediumship, these inex-\nplicable phenomena of professional mediums seemed to me worth\nnoting.\nMr. Massey further quotes a sentence in which I disclaim the pre-\nsumption of supposing that I could produce evidence better in quality\nthan much of that produced by men like Mr. Crookes, Mr. Wallace,\nand De Morgan; and infers that as these gentlemen largely\nexperimented with professional mediums, some of whom lie\nunder grave suspicions of imposture, therefore I must have in-\ntended to encourage investigation with paid mediums and detected\nimpostors, in spite of my explicit statements to the contrary. This\ninference seems to me strained and unreasonable. In uttering the\ndisclaimer in question I was not thinking at all of the character of the\nmediums employed-that was a point I intended to discuss afterwards-\nbut merely of the scientific position of the investigators and the im-\npressiveness of their accounts. The phrase was, indeed, stronger than any\nI should now use, after four years' additional experience. Still, if I\nhad now an opportunity of repeating, with a private medium of un-\nblemished character, some of Mr. Crookes' \"further experiments on\npyschic force\" (see his Plumomena of Spiritualism, pp. 36, 37), or De\nMorgan's most striking experiment with Mrs. Hayden (see p. xliii. of\nthe preface to From Matter to Spirit), I would spare no pains to avail\nmyself of it; and if I could obtain similar results with sufficient\nrepetition and nriation of conditions, I ~~y &~f.@em as\n\fThe P088ibUities of Mal-Observation. 105\nevidentially important. But I should certainly not put them forward\n&8 evidence if I knew the supposed medium to be a detected impostor.\nNor should I seek evidence from such tainted sources i-not because I\nhold that evidence involving tricksters cannot be raised to a pitch that\nwould exclude explanation by trickery, except on the supposition of the\ninvestigator's idiocy; but because an extended experience has led me to\nregard the chance of its being so raised as too slight to counterbalance\nthe palpable evil of encouraging an immoral trade. Suppose tha.t such\ndescriptions as Mr. Massey and others have given of Eglinton's s1a~\nwriting had been given of the performances of an avowed conjurer:\nsurely no one would have suggested that we were forced to the su~\nposition of idiocy or mendacity or hallucination on the part of the\nobservers: and if not, the supposition cannot be any more necessary\nin the case of Eglinton.\nMr. Massey holds that my preference of private mediums to admitted\nimpostors is a \"weak: point in my position\" if \" our aim is to obtain\nexact proof.\" It is clear from this that he mistakes my position. He\nregards unblemished character and stringency of tests as alternatives: I\nregard them as conditions which we should aim at combining. But, as\nI have often said, I do not expect to obtain cogent proof of an unknown\nlaw of nature by a single experiment: I do not hope to get it by any-\nthing less than a large accumulation of experiments of the beat attain-\nable quality.\nMr. Massey further suggests that I have changed my ground in\nnow resting my objection to paid mediums partly on a presumption of\ntheir conjuring capacities. He will find, however, that I have drawn\nattention to this characteristic, as belonging to professional but not to\nprivate mediums, in an address which I delivered a year later. (See\nProceedings, Vol. I., p. 249.) The reason that I did not mention this,\n&8 well as the pecuniary motive to fraud, in prescribing the lines of\ninvestigation in my first address, was merely that it seemed less easy\nto eliminate with certainty. We can be sure that we have not paid a\ngiven person, but we cannot be sure that he has not long practised\ntrickery, though in some cases we can show it to be highly improbable\nthat he has practised it sufficiently to become an expert trickster.\nBy the way, I entirely agree with Mr. Massey that cheating-even\nsuccessful cheating-and professional conjuring are quite different\nthings. ~ do not suppose that Sillode and Eglinton could succeed as\nrivals of Maskelyne or Verbeck. But I have no reason-nor has Mr.\nMassey offered any-for regarding their powers of slate-writing as\naltogether self-taught; nor do I think it marvellous that, even without\nany training by avowed conjurers, they should have acquired a high\ndegree of skill in this special line during their many years of practice.\nMr. Massey seems to think it inexplicable, SUPpo~Kd~~~~~\n\f106 The Possibilities of Mal-Ob8eroatwn.\nmer6 trickster, that I should have seen through him on one occasion (in\n1876), whereas some of his performances have baftled professional\nconjurers. I cannot think that the art of finding out unknown tricks\nis so entirely technical as this inference assumes; nor does it seem to\nme improbable that Slade should be sometimes careless with persons\nwho appear easy to. take in, or sometimes clumsy in adapting himself\nto the supposed tastes of his customers. In my case, as I conceive, he\nhoped to impress an academic mind by presenting unasked a slate in-\nscribed with five sentences in different modern languages, obviously taken\nout of a conversation-book, and one phrase out of the Greek Testament.\nI did not exactly see the trick done; but I saw when substi-\ntution might have taken place; and, considering the performance in\nthe light of later exposures, I cannot doubt that it was a prepared trick.\nFinally, Mr. Massey is surprised that, my views being what they\nare, I should have attempted to obtain personal experience of Eglinton's\n\"phenomena.,\" with the assistance of experts in conjuring. I certainly\nshould not have done this, had I known what I now know of Eglinton's\nantecedents; nor, I think, even without this knowledge, if it had not\nbeen for the situation in which I was at the time placed, as President\nof the Society. In accordance with my wishes----upressed in the\naddress above referred to-()ur \"Physical Phenomena Committee\"\navoided the employment of paid mediums; but their efforts to obtain\nevidence elsewhere led to no satisfactory result, and murmurs began to\nbe heard from Spiritualists among us that we were neglecting an\nunequalled opportunity of obtaining conclusive phenomena through the\nmediumship of Eglinton. I was anxious that our committee should\nadhere to their rule, so far as their official investigation went,\nand that none of the Society's funds should go in paying guineas to\na professional slate-writer; but I thought it better to make some con-\ncession to the murmurers, and I preferred to make it by arranging pri-\nvately for a series of experiments with Eglinton. lIaving come to this\nresolution, it seemed clearly desirable to seek the co-operation of a con-\njurer. The scientific object of any such investigation must be to exclude\npossible known causes of the apparently inexplicable phenomena. In the\ncase ofslate-writing, the most obvious of such causes was trickery, at any\nrate somewhat similar to a conjurer's: I therefore thought it impor-\ntant to get the aid of an expert in conjuring as a means of bringing our\nexperiments up to the highest attainable pitch of conch.tsiveness,\nwhether the result was positive or negative. And I thought that we were\nfortunate in obtaining the assistance of an accomplished amateur-Mr.\nAngelo J. Lewis-who was prepared to enter on the investigation with\na perfectly open mind. That he obtained no satisfactory result does\nnot surprise me, knowing what I now know of Eglinton.\nDigitized by@i~oJ[.\n\fThe Po88ibilitie8 of Mal-Ob8ervation. 107\nI am sorry to be obliged to take up some further space in conse-\nquence of Professor Sidgwick's latest remarks. Here is the passage, in\nhis first Address, which immediately follows the already quoted reference\nto the evidence of Crookes, Wallace, and de Morgan, and on which I\nchiefly base the representation considered by Professor Sidgwick to be\nwithout justification (italics are mine) :-\" But it is clear that from what\nI have already defined as the aim of the Society, however good Borne of\n1M evidencema!l be in quality, we require a great deal more ofit.\" If\nthe recommendation, that we should as much as possible direct our\ninvestigation to ph~nomena with private mediums, is to be read as a\n\"distinct statement of opinion\" that we ought to avoid paid mediums\nas much as possible, I can only remark that that either is or is not\nconsistent with what Professor Sidgwick said elsewhere in the same\nAddress. In my view, it is consistent, because we may well prefer\ninvestigation with private mediums, and may yet attach high im-\nportance to the accumulation of the best evidence with professional\nmediums-such evidence as that of Zollner, &c.-whether obtained\nwithin or without the Society. It is to be observed that I was not\nspeaking of original research by the Society, and that I said nothing to\nimply that Professor Sidgwick had encouraged this or that sort of direct\ninvestigation by the Society. We get our fac~ur evidence-from\nalien sources at least as much as from our own experience. Estimating\nmore highly than I do the difficulty of avoiding imposture with paid\nmediums, Professor Sidgwick might well deprecate the regular employ-\nment of them, as bad economy of time and resources, and might neverthe-\nless recognise the importance of accumulating testimony equal to that of\nwhich he said we want \"a great deal more of it.\" Professor Sidgwick\nhas therefore not quite correctly stated the inference I drew from his\nwords, and it is hardly necessary for me to insist on such passages a.a\n.. it is highly desirable that the investigation of these matters should be\ncarried on by men who have tried to acquaint themselves with the\nperformances of conjurers,\" though I fail to see the high desirability of\nthis if investigation is to \u00b7be restricted as Professor Sidgwick thinks it\nshould be. And further, as he even now admits that evidence with\nthose he calls tricksters may be raised to a pitch that would exclude\nexplanation by trickery, it is obvious that my worst mistake lay in\nsupposing that he would feel obliged to acknowledge that such evidence\nhad been accumulated since he addressed us in 1882, and not in the\nsupposition that he had recognised the poBBibility of this happening\nwith paid mediums who had been under suspicion. I thought we had\nreached the pitch of evidence at which the question of the sort of\nmedium would be admittedly as indifferent to Professor Sidgwick as it\nis to me. He thinks otherwise. But I am still unable to see my\n\" misrepresentation.\" Digi\n\f108 The PoBSibilitie8 of Mal-Observation.\nI need not now dwell on what seems to me the petitio principii\ninvolved in the supposition of such descriptions as I and others have\ngiven of Eglinton's slate-writing being given of the performances of an\navowed conjurer, because much of my paper was an attempt to show\nthat such a supposition is an impossible one. No mere conjurer baa\never yet submitted, and none ever will submit, to BOme conditions\nunder which the slate-writing baa been repeatedly observed with\nEglinton, or will ever undertake to produce the appearance of such\nconditions, so as to induce a witneBB to give such an account as I\nconsider really good evidence.\nProfessor Sidgwick seems to have misunderstood the bearing of my\nobservation with regard to his supposed detection of Slade (which it\nseems was no detection at all). It is not in the least\" inexplicable\" to\nme that a good conjurer should occasionally be careleBB, and should\nthus be detected by one who is not an expert. But my argument was\nthat such trickery, so detected, certainly raises no presumption of\nconsummate conjuring capabilities. I do not say it u:cludu the hy-\npothesis of the latter, though I think it is decidedly unfavourable to it.\nAll I say is that you must have other grounds to go upon, and that even\nif you think you have such other grounds, the detected cheating is\nrather in your way than otherwise. It is a fact prima facie so far\nat variance with great conjuring capabilities that it would have to\nbe exlained in BOme such way as that in which Professor Sidgwick\nexplains it.\nAnd this brings me to Profeaaor's Sidgwick's references to my\nadmissions of trickery by mediums. Now, in the first place, I\nbelieve that a very great deal of what seems to be trickery is only\napparently such. And I hold that the appearance of it is not only ex-\nplainable, but is actually necessitated by the hypothesis of mediumship.\nTo make good this remark would require a distinct paper. But even\nwhere the physical agency of the medium is undeniable, I cannot, upon\ngrounds well understood by Spiritualists, always, or even commonly.\ninfer that the agency is voluntary. That there is a residue of con-\nscious, intentional fraud I am, of course, aware. But as regards Mr.\nEglinton in particular, I must in justice say that I have made no\nadmissions, and that I do not believe he has IlW1' tricked-consciously\nor unconsciously-in the slate-writing, though I am quite prepared to\nhear that with him, as with other mediums, deficient power baa had ita\nusual &C'.companiment of \"suspicious\" results. But as my opinion of\nhis \"mediumship\" is quite independent of any estimate of his character,\nI am exempt from the obligation to form a decided judgment on certain\nof his alleged antecedents--a. judgment I should find more difficult\nthan Professor Sidgwick baa found it.\n.-Q. c. jfAf!8BY.\nDigitized by \\.;OD61~\n\fThe POBBibilities of Mal-Observation. 109\nShould any reader still feel an unexhausted interest in the question\nwhether Mr. Massey's misrepresentation of my advice was justifiable, I\nmust ask him to read the address it&elf-which he will find at the\nbeginning of the first volume of our Proceedinga-along with the\npolemical reference to it in Mr. Massey's paper. He will, I think,\neasily convince himself (1) that the\" we\" who were urged to \"accumu-\nlate fact on fact\" were precisely and palpably the same \"we\" who had\npreviously been advised to \"direct investigation, as much as possible, to\nphenomena where no pecuniary motives to fraud can come in;\" (2) that\nmy aversion to encouraging the trade of detected impostors was\nexpressed quite unmistakably; and (3) that the complimentary phrase\nin which I referred to the investigations of our predecessors could not\nreasonably be understood to qualify my subsequent distinct recommen-\ndations. But I can hardly imagine that any reader will take this\ntrouble; it is now very unimportant-even to myself-whether I\nexpressed my opinion as clearly as I intended four years ago. What I\nchiefly desire is to prevent any further m'isapprehension of my views. I\nhave long held that the great scandal of modem Spiritualism is the\nencouragement it has always given to the nefarious trade of professional\nimpostors. I feared that the formation of the Society for Psychical\nResearch would almost inevitably have some effect of this undesirable\nkind; and I determined, at any rate, to do all I could to reduce the\nextent of the evil. I did not propose a rigid rule of avoiding \"paid\"\nmediums or \"subjects\"; partly thinking that some pecuniary compensa-\ntion for loss of time might be found necessary, in the case of prolonged\ninvestigation with any persons of limited leisure. But I certainly\nhoped that we might avoid altogether the kind of evidence on which\nMr. Massey's paper entirely relies-the reports of the \" phenomena\" of\npersons like Monck, Slade, and Eglinton. In the case of Monck,\nMr. Massey tacitly admits that imposture has been proved ; that Slade\n\"often cheats\" he has expressly stated; as regards the evidence\nagainst Eglinton he declares that he would have some difficulty in\nforming a decided judgment. This point, then, I must leave for the\nreader to decide, after studying the evidence to which I have directed\nhis attention;1 if he should still think it right to spend his guineas on\nEglinton, he will at any ra~I hope-not suggest that he is acting in\naccordance with my recommendation.\nFor my own part,I have come to the conclusion-not by apriori\nreasoning, but from much personal experience and examination of the\nexperience of others-that it is only under \"ery exceptional circum-\nstances that the serious student of Spiritualism should investigate the\n1 Members and Associates of the Society for Psychical Research will Hnll\nthe evidence given in the Journal for June, 1886, pp. 282~28i.

That anyone who\nis induced by narratives of marvel to enter on this line of investigation\nshould first take all the pains in his power to acquaint himself with the\npoaaibilities of producing by trickery the appearance of such marvels-\nthis proposition, I conceive, will be generally admitted. But\nMr. Masaey at least seems to think that no trouble of this sort need be\ntaken by the investigator who confines his attention to private mediums.\nThis is not my view. On the contrary, I hold that in the case\nof private, no less than professional mediums, it is very important\nthat the investigator should be, if poaaible, competent to judge how far\nthe results that he deacribes--or rather his impreasions of them-could\nbe produced by trickery; at least, if his evidence is to afford any\neffective corroboration of the medium's own asaertions. I am far from\naying that the study of conjuring will always enable him to judge\ncorrectly on this point, nor do I even think that i1; would be in all cases\nthe best method of training his judgment, but I think that it is likely\nto be useful in most caaea ; it; would at least tend to prevent his testi-\nmony from being vitiated-aa much Spiritualistic evidence now is-by\nexpressions of confident reliance on the moat palpably inadequate\ntests.\nH.

S.\ne- n t\nIn concluding this brief account, I will sUlIlJlllU\"iae the results which I\nwould venture to draw from my experiments.\nI have always, as baa been seen, taken part myself in the experiments,\nand have never been a mere looker-on. This was for the purpose of guarding\nagainst every form of deception to which I might otherwise have fallen a\nvictim, and of finding the key to the explanation of the phenomenon.\nAlthough this last hope baa not been fulfilled, owing to the small amount of\ntime that I could devote to these observations, I have, nevertheleB8, noticed\nsome not unimportant points.\nThe preliminary conditions of a succeuful .itting appear to me to be :-\nA very quiet locality, with plenty of fresh air and a moderate temperature.\nOnly persona ought to take part in the experiments whose presence is agree-\nable to the percipient, and who htl knows will not be disturbed or annoyed\nby occasional failure. The percipient must be in a calm and contented frame\nof mind; the agent must be in sympathy with him, and must himself have\nthe knack of conducting the experiments easily and pleasantly. The\neyes of the percipient should then be bandaged with a light silk handker-\nchief, in such a way that the bandage passes also over the ears.\nThe agent and percipient then proceed respectively in the manner\ndescribed above.\nThe agent should now form, as vividly as possible, a mental picture of\nthe object-beat imagined as a shining white on \" b1a.ck background.\nThis picture he should hold fast with the greatest energy, and let no other\nthoughts interfere with it. The percipient, on the contrary, must endeavour\nabove everything not to strain expectation in looking for the emergence\nof the image, but simply to wait quietly. He should empty his brain, as it\nwere, of all disturbing imaginations, and gaze with clos~z~lb~~d'gf~P\n\f124 Muscle-Reading and Tlwught-Transfere:nce.\ndarkness. There will then BOOn emerge in it imagea of objecta, diagrama,\n&c., which seem to change into one another. He should be patient until one\nof theBe remaina quietly before him, and seems definite to him. Then he\nshould take the bandage off, and draw what he baa seen.\nFrequently, at the moment of drawing, the image disappears, and cannot\nbe correctly fixed on the paper. In this case another trial ought to be made.\nWhen he baa drawn he should uk, \"Is it right 1\" And the a.nIwer\nshould be only No or Yea. If he now desires it, a second experiment may\nbe attempted; but more than two should not be made, &I this fatigues\nboth agent and percipient.\nI have only one further remark to make-that deception, conacious or UD-\nconscious, is altogether out of the queation &I regards the foregoing caaea.\nThe above-named gentlemen, &I well &I myself, pledge their word to that\neffect.1 MAx DB880IB..\nThe following shorter record is taken from the monthly journal BpMM:\n(Leipzig), for June, 1886, and we have not seen the original diagrama.

H. MYERS.\n\u00a7 1. The nucleus of the following paper consists of some personal\nobservations of a remarkable hypnotic subj~bSt!rvations which the\nkindness of Dr. Gibert and Professor Pierre Janet enabled me to make\nat Havre, April 20-24, 1886.\nThe most striking feature in this case was the sommeil adistance,\nor, if I may so term it, eelepatM,c \"''lJP'Mti8m i-the production, that is to\nsay, of sleep and other hypnotic phenomena by the will, or mental sugges-\ntion, of a person at a distance from the subject.\nThis is not, of course, the first time that such a phenomenon has\nbeen observed. In PhantasmIJ of ths Living (Vol. I., Chap. 3; Vol.\nII. Supp~ement, Chap. 1; and Additional Chapter) will be found\na collection of the more trustworthy cases; and Mr. Gurney has\npointed out their analogy to the spontaneous cases of telepathy, of which\nthat book furnishes many examples. But from the side of AypnoeiBm\nno attempt whatever, so far as I know, has been made to correlate this\nhypnogenous 1 forceorsuggestionat a distancewith hypnogenous agencies\nemployed in the subject's actual presence,-hypnogenous suggestion\nwhich actually reaches his ear. The mesmerists proper, talking of their\nvital influence, have said, .. This influence can sometimes act over great\ndistances.\" And more recently the 8Uf\/Uestionues, if I may so term them,\nhave sometimes spoken of this distant command as though it were\nmerely a form of suggestion-as if it fell under that heading with as\nlittle difficulty as the mere deferred 8Uf\/uestion, which works itself\nout at a distant time, instead of working itself out at the same time,\nbut at a distant point of space.\nThe confusion involved in both these modes of expression is great.\nThe mesmerists have ignored the difficulty of supposing that an effiuence\nwhich they hold actually to emanate from eyes and fingers can operate\nthrough stone walls and across streets filled with the interfering\ninfluence of other men and women. And the suggestionists seem to me\nnever to have analysed what is meant by 8Uf\/uestion-a word of indis-\npensable convenience, but which, as I shall endeavour to show, has been\nused to include methods of hypnogeny which differ widely from one\nanother.\nI must adopt from the French the word Aypnogeny for the production of\nhypnotic states: Ay,terogeny for the production of hysterical states; dynamo\nogenyfor the production of increased nervous activity; aJltAuiogen for a substance\nwhOll8 contact or proximity gives rise to unexplained nervous actionG I\nDigitized by oog e\n\f128 On Telepathic Hypnotism.\nAfter narrating, therefore, my observations on Madame B.'s Bmnmeil\nti avlance, I felli unwilling to If-ave the case as a mere isolated marvel,\nand unwilling also to connect it with more familiar forms of hypnotism\nby what seem to me mere vague phrases about an extension of \"the\nrange of mesmeric influence,\" or of .. the scope of suggestion.\" So I have\nbriedy reviewed some other recent ca.ses--Dr. H~ricourt's, Dr. Dusart's,\nDrs. Bourru and Burot's-a.nd have then endeavoured, in a provisional\nand very imperfect manner, to analyse the various forms of hypnotic\nsuggestion, and to correlate them, in an intelligible series, with the\nnumerous and disparate methods of experimentally inducing the\nhypnotic trance which have been practised by competent observers. I\nhave been obliged to do this very briedy, and to omit any discussion\nof the true definition and limit of \"hypnotic phenomena\" themselves.\nThis, too, needs doing on a more comprehensive plan than has been yet\nattempted.\n\u00a7 2. Before giving my own notes on Madame B.'s case, it will\nbe necessary to furnish some &CCOunt of M. Pierre Janet's previous\nobservations, as recorded in his \"Note sur quelques pMnomenes de\nsomnambulisme.\" (Bulletim rU la Societl rU P\"!Icho~ Phyriologiqve,\nTome I., p. 24.) 1 Professor Janet was kind enough to allow me to\nperuse his notes, taken mainly at the actual moment of observation;\nand, although I am naturally not at liberty to print any matter as yet\nunpublished, I can vouch for the scrupulous care with which he has\ncompiled his account of the ca.se.\nI had al80 the advantage of conversation with Dr. Gibert and\nhis family, who are well acquainted with Madame B. Dr. Gibert\nis the \"Doyen du Syndioat M~ical de la France,\" and a leading\nphysician at Havre. He has long practised hypnotism, which he bas\ndirected mainly to therapeutic ends. Madame B., while at Havre,\nis received into the house of a sister of Dr. Gibert's; and his\nfamily, who have acceBB to the somnambule at all hours, confirm\nProfessor Janet's estimate of her simplicity and honesty of character.\nOf the genuinen688 of the induced somnambulism in this case no\ndoubt has been felt, so far as I know, by any observer. The aruesthesia,\nthe contractures, the variations in redex action, &C. (as well as the\nwoman's previous history), supply sufficient evidence on this point. But\neven after this fundamental fact has been proved (which in the present\nstate of our knowledge of hypnotism is not very difticult), there remains\na question, 1688 definite indeed, but highly important, as to the temper\nof mind which the subject carries with her into the trance. Thus, for\ninstance, there is, of course, no doubt as to the reality of the trance of\n\"1& nommk Wi~\"-whom, thanks to Dr. F~r~'s kindness, I ha\\\u00b7e\nI See also PAantMnu qf tAe L,'IJi\"9, Vol. ii, ~6i9. I\nDigitized by ~008 e\n\fOn Telepathic Hypnotism. 129\nobserved at the Salpetriere-the asylum, or rather the arena, of her\nhystero-epileptic exploits. But\" Wii-\" is the very type and culmina-\ntion of the hysterical diathesis, and her trickiness and love of notice\nare so integral a part of her that while she runs through her phases of\ncatalepsy, lethargy, and so on, one still suspects (if I ma.y so say) a\ncataleptic cunning and a lethargic vigilance as to the operator's will.\nMadame R, the subject of these researches, is of a very\ndifferent type. She is a heavy, middle-aged, peasant woman, with a\npatient, stolid expression, and a very limited intelligenoe and\nvocabulary. She has, indeed, been more or less somnambulic from\nchildhood, and a Dr. Feron, since dead, and other persons, seem to have\nexperimented on her long ago. But she has never made hypnotism her\nbusiness; she was drawn to Havre by some medical kindness received\nfrom Dr. Gibert; and care is taken that she shall not make money out\nof her stay. Her trance-state is never mentioned to her in her normal\nstate; nor does she in any way seek notice as a .. sensitive\" ; on the\ncontrary, she plainly dislikes heing sent to sleep from a distance, and\nhas repeatedly tried to prevent it.! I have seen her only in the trance-\nstate, and I share the general impression that what she says in that\nstate is naively and sincerely said, and probably gives a true account\nof her own feelings and actions.\nI will now briefly summarise M. Janet's principal results.\nII. Induction of trance in presence or close proximity of subject.\nSleep usually induced by holding her hand. She is then only\nresponsive to the operator. He alone can make contra.ctures disap-\npear, &c. Gaze from operator's eye unnecessary. Slight pressure\nof thlAmb suffices; but no pressure (except severe pn>.ssure on thumb)\nis efficacious without mental concentration--operator's will to put\nher to sleep. \"This influence of the operator's thougltt, extraordi-\nnary, as it may seem, is here quite preponderant; so much 80 that\nit can take the place of all other influences.\" Will witlwut\ntouch induces sleep. Taking precautions to avoid suggestion, it is found\nthat (1) M. Janet, while sitting near her, sends her to sleep when, and\nonly when, he wills it; (2) M.. Gibert from adjoining room sends her to\nsleep, M. Janet remaining near her, but not willing; there is evidence\nthat the sleep is of M. Giherl', induction, for she is in rapport with hinl\nonly; whereas had sleep come from suggestion of operator's proximity, the\nsuggestion would pl'obably have been derived from .1[. Janet', close\npresence. Nevertheless, she did know that Dr. Gibert was in the house.\n(The question as to degrees of proximity will be discussed later on.)\n~. Induction of trance at a distance from subject.\n1 M. Ja.net says (RB'I1. PhilOBOphique, August, 1886) that Madame B., when\nawake, is not aware that she can be hypnotised from a distance. My remark\napplies to her knowledge a.nd acts in the incipient or completed tran~ I\nDigitized by ~O~ e\n\f130 On Telepathic Hypnotism.\nOct. 3, 1885. M. Gibert tries to put her to sleep from distance of\nhalf-a-mile j M. Janet finds her awake; puts her to sleep; she says, \"I\nknow very well that M. Gibert tried to put me to sleep, but when I felt\nhim I looked for some water, and put my hands in cold water. I don't\n,:ant people to put me to sleep in that way; it puts me out, and makes\nme look silly.\" . She had, in fact, held her hands in water at the time\nwhen M. Gibert willed her to sleep.\nOct. 9. M. Gibert succeeds in a similar attempt; she says in trance,\n\"Why does M. Gibert put me to sleep from bis house 1 I had not time\nto put my hands in my basin.\" That the sleep was of M. Gibert's\ninduction was shown by M. Janet's inability to wake her. M. Gibert\nhad to be sent for.\nIt is observable, however, that MM. Janet and Gibert can now\n(April, 1886) operate interchangeably on the subject; her familiarity\nwith both seems to enable either to wake her from a trance which the\nother has induced.\nOct. 14. Dr. Gibert again succeeded in inducing the trance, from a\ndistance of two-thirds of a mile, at an hour suggested by a third\n;person, and not known to M. Janet, who watched the patient.\nl' Influence exercised from a distance during trance.\nOn Oct. 14 she had been put to sleep at 4.15, as aforesaid. At 5,\nat 5.5, and at 5.10 she rose, exclaimed, \"Enough, don't do that,\" then\nlaughed once, and added, \"You can't; if you are the least distracted I\nrecover myself,\" and fell back into deep sleep. At those moments\nM. Gibert had attempted to make her perform certain acts in her sleep.\nSimilar results followed from a mental command given in her proximity\nduring her sleep.l\n~. Deferred mental suggestion.\nOn Oct. 8 M. Gibert pressed his forehead to hers, and gave a\nmental order (I omit details, precautions, &c.) to offer a glass of\nwater at 11.30 a.m. next day to each person present. At the hour\nassigned she showed great agitation, took a glass, came up from the\nkitchen, and asked if she had been summoned, came and went often\nbetween ,alon and kitchen; was put to sleep from a distance by\n)1. Gibert; said, \"I had to come; why will they make me carry\nglasses 1 I had to say something when I came in.\" Two somewhat\naimilar experiments were made October 10th and 13th.1I\n\u00a7 3. Thus far M. Janet's account of the autumn experiments,\npostponing any description of \u00b7the stages through which the subject\n1 Before our arrival in April, 1886, Dr. Jules Janet effected a curious traDa\u00b7\nference of sensation. He went into an adjoining room and burnt his right wriat\nseverely. Madame B. uttered piercing cries. and clMped her wrist in the same\npla.ce. See Rev. Phil. for August, 1886, p. 222, for details.\nI Some further cases are given in 1ltIrJ. PAil. for August.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fOn Telepathic Hypnotism,. 131\npassed. In February and in April, 1886, Madame B. was again brought\nto Havre, and some succesSful experiments (tabulated below) were made\nbefore my arrival on April 20th.\nI give next my own notes of experiments, April 20-24th, taken\nat the time in conjunction with Dr. A. T. Myers, and forming the\nbulk of a paper presented to the Societe de Psychologie Physiologique\non May 24th.\n\"I have been asked to write an account of some instances of somnam-\nbulic sleep induced at a distance, which I observed at Havre, through\nthe kindness of Dr. Gibert and Professor Pierre Janet, April 20-24th,\n1886. This account is founded on notes taken by me at the time, and\nrevised on the same or following days by Dr. A. T. Myers, who was\npresent at the experiments throughout. Other observers were Dr.\nGibert, Professor Pa.ul J a.net, Professor Pierre Janet, Dr. Jules Janet,\nDr. Ochorowicz, and M. Marillier, some of whom have given, or are\nabout to give, independent accounts.\n\"I shall confine myself to the cases of production of sleep at a\ndistance by mental suggestion, with one case of deferred mental sugges-\ntion of an act to be performed. In order that the phenomenon of\n.ommeil adistance may be satisfactory, we have to guard against three\npossible sources of error, namely, fraud, accidental coincidence, and\nsuggestion by word or gesture.\n\"The hypothesis ofjraw! on the part of operators or subject may\nhere be set aside. The operators were Dr. Gibert and Professor Pierre\nJanet, and the detailed observations of Professor Pierre Janet, else-\nwhere published, sufficiently prove the genuineness of Madame B.'s som-\nnambulic sleep. And, in fact, to anyone accustomed to hypnotic pheno-\nmena the genuine character of Madame B.'s trance is readily apparent.\n\"The hypothesis of apcidental coincidence would be tenable (though\nnot probable) did the events of April 20-24th constitute the whole\nof the observed series. But the number of coincidences noticed\nby Dr. Gibert, Professor Janet, and others has been so large that the\naction of mere chance seems to be quite excluded. It is to be observed\nthat, as Professor Janet tells us, the subject has, during an observation\nof several weeks (maintained by Mlle. Gibert when Professor Janet\nis not present), only twice fallen spontanp-ously into this somnambulic\nsleep (when no one willed her to do so); once before our arrival, on\nlooking a.t a picture of Dr. Gibert, and once on April 21st, as narrated\nbelow.l On the other hand, the observed cases of sleep deliberately\n1 Ofthe spontaneous sleep on April 21 {mentioned in e.g. Case i.l, M. Janet\nwrites (.&m. Phil., August): \"Elle se rendormit spontanement deux heures\napres avoir etC reveillee, mail! elle etait dans une periude oil je l'endormais tollS\nles jonrs plllsieurs fois, et elle avait simplement eM mal reveillee. D'ailleurs,\npendant ces deux heures d'inten'alle, elle n'avait pu ni parler ni manger: elle\netait donc restee rualheureuseruent dans un etat de deml\u00b7sommeil.\"\nDigi K 2\n\f132 On Telepathic Hypnotis'Tn.\ninduced from a distance amount, I believe, to at least a dozen.! I exclude,\nof course, the very numerous occasions when sleep has been induced by\nan operator present with the patient, by holding her thumbs, looking at\nher, &c. This, however, brings us to the third source of doubt, whether\nthe sleep may not on all occasions have been induced by some sugg88tWn,\ngiven perhaps unconsciously, by word or gesture. It was thus that I\nwas at first inclined to explain Cases I. and II. among those that follow,\nbut the other cases here given seem to negative the supposition.\n\"I still, however, would explain by mere suggestion all the experi-\nments which I saw made with the magnet. On one occasion, when I\nhad gone into an adjoining room with the magnet, and this was known\nto all present, Madame B. followed me, as though a.ttracted.\nShe was taken back to her place, and shortly afterwards I came and\nsat beside her with the magnet in my pocket, no one knowing that it\nwas there. No effect whatever was produced on the subject. I made\nsome other experiments with the magnet, with a similarly negative\nresult. I would strongly recommend that when magnetic experiments\nare made with sensitives the following precautions should be used,\nwhich our expel-ience in the Society for Psychical Research has shown\nto be necessary for the exclusion of suggestion.\n\"1. Only electro-magnets should be employed, in order to effect\nsudden and noiseless transitions from the presence to the absence of\nmagnetic force.\n\"2. The operator in charge of the commutator should be in a\ndifferent room from the subject.\n\"3. Care should be taken that no indication as to the state of the\nmagnet should be drawn from the 'magnetic click' which accompanies\nthe magnetisation of the electro-magnet. [The subject's ears may be\nstopped, or the click repeated many times running, so that it is\nimpossible to tell whether there have been an even or uneven number\nof clicks, and consequently whether the condition of the instrument is\nor is not changed.]\n\" It is not necessary here to go into further detail. Suffice it to say\nthat it is not safe to trust to an apparently lethargic or anRlStbetic\nstate in the subject as a guarantee against her gathering suggestions\nfrom the words or manner of persons present. If, moreover, she be\nsusceptible of mental suggestion, the effects of such suggestion may be \u2022\nmistaken for the effects of magnetic influence.\n\"I. I pass on to describe the first case of 'O'mmeil adistance, April\n21st. At 5.50 p.m. <an hour which was selected by drawing lots among\nvarious suggested hours), Dr. Gibert retired to his study and en-\ndeavoured to send Madame B. to sleep in the PavilIon, at a distance of\n1 This number. as will be hereafter seen, hu since bee~\nDigitized by '\"\"'-''-'0'\"\n\fOn Telepathic Hypnotism. 13~\nabout tw(>.thirds of a mile. She was to fall asleep in the ,alon;\n'Whereas she habitually sits in the kitchen of the Pavillon (a house\noccupied by Dr. Gibert's sister).\nCI It was supposed that the command would take about 10 minutes to\noperate, and at about six Professor Janet, Dr. Ochorowicz, M. Marillier,\nmy brother and myself entered the Pavillon, but found that Madame\nB. was not in the ,alon bu~ in the kitchen. We immediately\nwent out again, supposing that the experiment had failed. A few\nminutes later Professor Janet re-entered with M. Ochorowicz, and found\nher asleep in the ,alon. In the somnambulic state she told us that she\nhad been in the ,aWn, and nearly asleep when our arrival startled her,\nand had then rushed down to the kitchen to avoid us; had returned to\nthe Balon and fallen asleep as soon as we left the house. These move-\nments were attested by the bonne, but it of course seemed probable that\nit was merely our arrival which had suggested to her that she was\nexpected to fall asleep.\n\" On this day she was ill and exhausted from too prolonged experi-\nments on the previous days. In the afternoon she fell asleep of her\nown accord, and in the late eveDing (11.35 p.m.), when she had long\nbeen in bed, M. Gibert willed that her natural sleep should be tra.na-\nferred into somnambulic, and that she should dress and go into the\ngarden of the Pavillon. Nothing followed on this attempt, unleaa an\nunusually prolonged sleep and complaints of unwonted headache next\nday were to be in any way connected herewith. On the whole, had I\nleft after these experiments only I should have referred the phenomena\nto suggestion of the ordinary hypnotic kind.\n\"II. On the morning of the 22nd, however, we again selected by lot\nan hour (11 a.m.) at which M. Gibert should will, from hia\ndispensary, (which is close to his house,) that Madame B. should\ngo to sleep in the PavilIon. It was agreed that a rather longer\ntime should be allowed for the proceaa to take effect; as it had been\nobserved (see M. Janet's previous communication,) that she sometime.\natruggled against the influence, and averted the effect for a time by\nputting her hands in cold water, &c. At 11.25 we entered the PavilIon\nquietly, and almost at once she descended from her room to the ,alon,\nprofoundly asleep. Here, however, suggestion might again have been\nat work. We did not, of course, mention M. Gibert's attempt of the\nprevious night. But she told us in her sleep that she had been very ill\nin the night, and repeatedly exclaimed: 'Pourquoi M. Gibert m'ar-t-il\nfait IOUffrirt Mais j'ai lav~ lea mains continuellement.' This is what\nahe does when she wishes to avoid being influenced.\nII III. In the evening (22nd) we all dined at M. Gibert's, and in the\nevening M. Gibert made another attempt to put her to sleep at a\ndiatance from his house in the Rue ~ry,-she .. ~ Jot JiIlJl\nDI9Itlz~d-~uo6le\n\f134 On Telepathic Hypnotism.\nPavilion, Rue de la Ferme,-and to bring her to his house by a.n\neffort of wilI.l At 8.55 he retired to his study; and MM.\nOchorowicz, Marillier, Janet, and A. T. Myers went to the\nPavilIon, and waited outside in the street, out of sight of the\nhouse. At 9.22 Dr. Myers observed Madame B. coming baJfwa.y\nout of the garden-gate, and again retreating. Those who saw her\nmore closely observed that she was plainly in the somnambulic state,\nand was wandering about and muttering. At 9.25 she ca.me out (with\neyes persistently closed, so far as could be seen), walked quickly past\nMM. Janet and Marillier, without noticing them, and made for\nM. Gibert's house, though not by the usual or shortest route. (It\nappeared afterwards that the bonne had seen her go into the saWn. a.t\n8.45, and issue thence asleep at 9.15: had not looked in between those\ntimes.2) She avoided lamp-posts, vehicles, &c., but crossed and re-\norossed the street repeatedly. No one went in front of her or spoke\nto her. After eight or ten minutes she grew much more uncertain in\ngait, and paused as though she would fall. Dr. Myers noted the\nmoment in the Rue Faure; it was 9.35. At about 9.40 she grew bolder,\nand at 9.45 reached the street in front of M. Gibert's house. There\nshe met him, but did not notice him, and walked into his house,\nwhere she rushed hurriedly from room to room on the ground-floor.\nM. Gibert had to take her hand before she recognised him. She then\ngrew ca.lm.\n\"M. Gibert said that from 8.55 to 9.20 he thought intently abouther;\nfrom 9.20 to 9.35 he thougbt more feebly; at 9.35 he gave the experi-\nment up, and began to play billiards; but in a few minutes began to\nwill her again. It appeared that his visit to the billiard-room bad\ncoincided with her hesitation and stumbling in the street. But this\ncoincidence may of course have been accidental.\n\"IV. Later in the evening M. Gibert made to her a mental suggetl-\ntion, by pressing his forehead against hers without other gesture or\nspeech. The suggestion (proposed by me) was that at 11 a.m. on the\nmorrow she should look at a photographic album in the salon of the\nPavillon. She habitually sat in the kitchen or in her own bedroom and\nsewed; so this was an unlikely occupation for a morning hour.\n\"On April 23rd, MM. Marillier and Ochorowicz went to the\nPavillon before 11 and ensconced themselves in a room opposite\nthe salon. At 11 Madame B. entered the salon and wandered\nabout with an anxious, preoccupied air. Professor Janet, Dr.\n1 It will be seen from the synopsis of experiments given below that the after\u00b7\nnoon and not the evening, was the time of day usually chosen.\n2 It was not unusual for her to sit in the salon in the evening, after the day's\noccupatiouswere over. izedbyGoogle\n\fOn Telepathic H'!f.P'Mtism. 135\nMyers, and I entered the Pavillon at 11.10 and found her obviously\nentranced; eyes open, but fixed; anxious; wandering.\n.. She continued thus till 11.25. We remained in a room where she\ncould not 1166 us, though, by looking through the partially-opened door,\nwe could see her. At 11.25 she began to handle some photographic\nalbums on the table of the salon; and at 11.30 was seated on the sofa\nfixedly looking at one of these albums, open on her lap, and rapidly\nsinking into lethargic sleep. As Boon as the talkative phase of her\nslumber came round she said, 'M. Gibert m'a tourmentee, parce qu'll\nm'a recommandee-ll m'a fait trembler.'\n\" I believe that this was a genuine instance of deferred mental\nsuggestion. But where a suggestion is known to so many persons as\nwas the case here, it is hard to feel sure that no word has been uttered\nby anyone which could give a clue to its nature.\n\"V. On this same day, 23rd, M. Janet, who had woke her up and left\nher awake, lunched in our company, and retired to his own house at\n4.30 (a time chosen by lot) to try to put her to sleep from thence. At\n5.5 we all entered the 8alon of the Pavillon, and found her asleep with\nshut eyes, but sewing vigorously (being in that stage in which movements\nonce suggested are automatically continued). Passing into the talka.-\ntive state, she said to M. Janet, 'C'est vous qui m'avez fait dormir\naquatre heures et demi.' The impression as to the hour may have been\na suggestion received from M. Janet's mind. We tried to make her\nbelieve that it was M. Gibert who had sent her to sleep, but she\nmaintained that she had felt that it was M. Janet.1\n\"VI. On April 24th the whole party chanced to meet at M.\nJanet's house at 3 p.m., and he then, at my suggestion, entered\nhis study to will that Madame B. should sleep. We waited\nin his garden, and at 3.20 proceeded together to the Pavillon, which\nI entered first at 3.30, and found Madame B. profoundly sleeping over\nher sewing, having ceased to sew. Becoming talkative, she said to\nM. Janet, 'C'est vous qui m'avez commandtie.' She said that she fell\nasleep at 3.5 p.m.2\nProfessor Janet's paper in the R611U8 PMlosopM,que for August,\n1886, enables me to give a conspectus of the experiments on 80mmeil a\ndistalnce made with Madame B. up to the end of May.

The hours of the other experiments were\ngenerally chosen at the moment, to suit the operators' convenience;\nsometimes, as I have said above, they were chosen by lot.\n\u00a7 4. I pass on to a brief analysis of a similar case contributed by\nDr. Hericourt to the Societe de Psychologie Physiologique, November\n30th, 1885 (Bulletins, Tome I., p. 35.)1\nCIe. Induction of trance in presence or proximity of subject. M.\nHericourt obtained trance by holding Madame's D.'s hand, then by\ntouching her hand, then by willing alone. Passes or grasp of hand had\nno effect unless accompanied by will. He induces trance without yisible\nsuggestion, from one end of the room to the other, by sudden effort of\nwill while she is talking, &c. ~ if he relaxes his will she recovers herself.\nfJ. Induction of trance at a distance. One day he tries to send her\nto sleep from his own house, at Perpignan (say 300 yards off), at 3 p.m. ;\nthen forgets her; then at 5 p.m. wills to wake her. She tells him\nspontaneously that at 3 she fell asleep (quite unusual with her during\nthe day); servant came in ; could not wake her; shook her; made her\npartly conscious, with violent headache, which suddenly disappeared at\n5 p.m. Experiment tried from adjoining room in a way to avoid expec-\ntant attention. Success.\n1. Influence exercised from a distance.\nM. Hericourt could impress no definite suggestion from a distance,\nbut when he thought fixedly of Madame D. she experienced severe pain\nin the prrecordial region. This gradually increased, and led to cess\u00b7\nation of the experiments. [Compare cases where an abortive epileptic\nattack is replaced by epileptiform migraine.]\n\u00a7 5. The next case which I shall notice is perhaps the most remark-\nable of all. I quote it from a paper presented, December 28th, 1885,\nto the Societe de Psychologie Physiologique, by Dr. Gley, the well-known\nphysiologist.I But the case is Dr. Dusan's, recorded by him in the\nTribune Medicale, May 16th and 30th, 1875. Dr. Gley knows Dr.\nDusart; and assures me that the account is compiled from careful notes\ntaken at the time.\nIII. Induction of trance in presence or proximity of subject.\nDr. Dusart induces trance on Mlle. J. by passes: observes that\nthey are ineffectual without his will: tries will alone: succeeds more\nthan 100 times: never fails.\n{3. Induction of trance at a distance. M. Dusart forgot one day to\norder Mlle. J. to sleep till a certain hour on the morrow, which\nhe usually did.\nI See also Phanta,g,ns, &c., Vol. ii., p. 683.\n'SeealsoPhantaams, &c., VoL ii, p. 685 izedbyGoogle\n\f138 On Telepathic H'JIP'MtiBm.\nAt a distance of 700 metres from her house he remembel'B the\nomission; gives order mentally to slet'p till 8 : finds her asleep next\nmorning. \" How is it that you are asleep 1\" CI I am obeying you.\"\n\" You mistake; I left you without giving any order.\" CI True; but\n5 minutes afterwards I perfectly heard you tell me to sleep till\n8 o'clock.\" To test this Dr. Dusart leaves hE'r asleep, telling her to\nRleep till he gives order: gives mental order two miles away, at 2 p.m. :\nshe wakes at 2 p.m. Experiment successfully repeated several times:\nonce he keeps her awa.ke by mental order, from a distance, while her\nfather tries to induce trance; she is aware that his influence is at work.\n\u00a7 6. These cases, and others like them, seem, then, to enforce on us\nthe conclusion that telepathic hypnotism is a fact-that certain of\nthe phenomena commonly described as hypnotic are occasionally\nproduced by the influence of an operator at a distance, under such\nconditions that no previous suggestion could have been given.\nWe must return, in fact, to the conclusion arrived at by the\ncommittee of the French Academy of Medicine which sat, as is well-\nknown, from 1826 to 1831, and reported through M. Husson. The\nfifteenth section of that Report runs as follows :-\n\" Loraqu'on a fait tomber une fois une personne dans Ie sommeil\nmagn~tique, on n'a pas toujoura besoin de recourir au contact et aux pa8Be8\npour la magn~tiaer de nouveau. Le regard du magn~tiaeur, sa volonW seule,\nontsur elle la m~me influence. Dans ce cas, on peut non-seulement agir aur\nIe magn~tis~, mais encore Ie mettre complhtement en somnambulisme et l' en\nf&ire aortir ason mau, hors de sa vue, aune certaine distance et au travera\ndes portes fenn~es. \"\nThis, however, is a statement which, takenby itself,would notbelikely\nto obtaineffectivelodgment inthe mind. That itmaybecome trulycredible.\nit must be co-ordinated with cognate facts; it must be presented, not as\na mere isolated anomaly, but as an item in some wider group of php.no-\nmena. It suggests two inquiries; first, whether other non-hypnotic cases\nof telepathy exist; and secondly, whether the hypnotic agencies already\nrecognised can be so arranged as that this telepathic agency, this hypnoti-\nsation from a distance, should be presented as the culminant phenomenon\nin a continuous series. Now to the first of the-se questions, our whole\nwork on Phantasms qf tlUJ Living supplies the answer. There do in\nfact exist (we maintain) so many cases and claases of telepathic influence\nthat this hypnotic clasafallsnaturallyinto its place as a species which we\nshould have felt bound to look for on merely analogical grounds. To the\nsecond question (as I have already said) no answer, so far as I know, has\nbeen yet attempted. I do not recall anyattemptto correla.te this telepathic\nhypnotism with the other methods of hypnotisation on which different\nexperimentel'B have relied. The elder Englishachnnrnl ~18-\nnlgltlzedb~Uv(51'-\n\fOn Telepathic Hypnotism. 139\nbelievers, I mean, in a specific, vital eftluence or inlluence-(as opposed\nto the Hypnotists proper, or believers in a mechanical agency alone in\nthe induction of trance),-the mesmerists, I repeat, have alto-\ngether missed the distinction between the exercise of vital influence in\nthe presence of immediate proximity of the subject, and its exercise at a\ndistance, say, of half-a-mile. When they have had cases of this distant\nkind to record they have mentioned them as mere extensions of the\nspecific vital power, without even attempting to show how it can be\nthat an eftluence emanating from one man's nervous system, and per-\nvading another man's nervous system by some sort of actual diffusion,\ncan operate in precisely the same manner at distances across which no\nphysiological activity (with the one exception of the skunk's) has been\nknown to project itself.\nAnd the difficulty which is thus ignored by Elliotson and Townshend\nis consciously dismissed as insoluble by the more cautious observers\nwhom I have been quoting in this paper. For convenience' sake they\nuse the analogy of suggestion and speak of \"suggestion at a distance\" ;\nbut they make no attempt to connect this distant suggestion with that\nsuggestion in the subject's actual pr886nCe with the efficacy of which we\nare now so abundantly familiar. .\nAnd I need hardlysaythat in myown view, also, no complete solution\nof the problem is possible. Weare entirely ignorant of the nature of\nthe force which may be supposed to be operative in the production of\ntelepathic phenomena,-to impel or facilitate the passage of thoughts\nor sensations from one mind to another without the intervention of\nthe recognised organs of sense.\n\u00a7 7. Yet it seems to me that there is something which it is possible\nto attempt; something which must needs be now attempted, in however\nfragmentary and provisional a manner, if there is to be any unity, any\nsense of msemble in hypnotic experimentation; if the results which\ndifferent observers obtain in such different ways are to throw upon each\nother the light which they are capable of affording. Some attempt, I\nrepeat, must be made to show the possibility of a transition from the\nmerely mechanical hypnogeny which the majority of modem writers\nadmit, to the vital or mesmeric hypnogeny which Mr. Gurney and I\n(in accordance with Cuvier, Esdaile, Elliotson, &c.) have defended\nin these P'T'oc66ding8, and which now again (apart from our directer\narguments) is receiving a kind of rellected or inferential probability from\nthese well-accredited cases of \"8ommeil adistance.\" And, furthermore,\nsuch an attempt should show also what kind of connection is empirically\nfound between this vital hypnogeny and the telepatl'ic hypnogeny with\nwhich this paper is mainly concerned-between the effect, that is to say,\nof the operator on the subject in the subject's presence, and his effect at a\ndistance. And in order to get any clearness into ournotionC11ItN\/tflAt\nDigitized fjy~V'U'<3rc:-\n\f140 On Telepathic Hypnotism.\nattack at once the extremely difficult question: What do we mean by\nIUfIgestion,\/ When we say that a subject is hypnotized by IIUfIgestion,\nwhat is the nature, what are the analogies of the force which we\nsuppose to be brought to bear upon him 11\nFirst, then, we Dlust observe that the word suggestion, as a cause\nof the hypnotic trance, may have at least four different meanings, viz.,\n(1) verbal suggestion, (2) self-suggestion, (3) mental suggestion from a\nperson present, (4) mental suggestion from a person absent.\nOrdinary verbal IIUfIgestion is, of course, a ptethod of inducing the\ntrance as to which all are agreed. Noone accustomed to these experi-\nments is surprised if when an operator says \"Sleep!\" to a su~ject\nwhom he has often previously hypnotized, that subject falls into the\ntrance. Very little attempt, however, has been made to C(H)rdinate\nthis method of hypnogeny with the other methods generally admitted\n(viz., monotonous stimulation and similar mechanical processes), and\nconfusion is frequently introduced at this point by mixing up psychical\nwith neural terms-by talking in the same breath of \"inhibition of\nnerve-centres \" and of \" expectant attention.\" But when we come to\nconsider any of the wider problems-such as whether or not mechanical\nstimulation is the sole originator of hypnotic phenomena-we find\nourselves obliged to reduce our terms to a common denominator, and\n(however vaguely or hypothetically) to form some conception of the\nnewral side of each operation. \u2022\nSuch an inquiry of course takes us on to very insecure ground. We\nknow next to nothing of the neural correlates of ideas or states of mind\n80 complex as some of those which occur in the hypnotic state. We are\ndealing with a problem which bristles with unknown qnantities,-\nwhere the physiological correlate of \"will,\" if I may so say, is z, and of\n\" consciousness\" 1\/, and of \"attention\" z. But the hopeful peculiarity\nof hypnotic phenomena is that in them the unknown z 1\/ z are mixed\nup and interchanged in all kinds of ways with-I do not say known,-\nbut less completely unknown-elements, namely with sensory stimuli of\nvarious kinds, familiar and unfamiliar, which form a sort of a b C,-\nquantities indefinite indeed, but varying only within certain assignable\nlimits. And though no complete solution to our equations is possible,\nwe may so manipulate them as to get a rather better notion of what\nz 1\/ z are likely to be than if, (as the pure metaphysician seems some-\ntimes to do), we merely arranged and rearranged the unknown symbols\n1 The chapter on cc Sujets et Proc~d6a\" in Dr. Cullerre'. MagnJtimu \"\nHypooti8me (Paria, 1886) may serve as an example of the incoMrmctJ of our\npresent knowledge of hypnogenous procesaea. Dr. Cullerre has taken pains to\ncollect a good many recent experiments, but he arranges them in a confeaaedl,.\nempirical-almoat haphazard-fashion. [See, however, Dr. Cha.m.banl'lBcheme\nin my Addendum.] . .. Gooole\nDigitized by \"\n\fOn Telepathic Hypnot\u00b7i8m. 141\nas fancy prompts. If, however, we try to use only terms of neural\naction, we incur a new danger-the danger of using words, originally\ndefinite, in such a way as to imply more knowledge than we really\npossess. The use that has been made of the word II inhibition\" has\noften, I think, landed us in quite as much vagueness as the II expectant\nattention\" which is the common pB1Jchical attempt to give the mot d~\nf lnigTM. For myself I hold that the enigma of hypnotism has no single\nanswer which solves it. I do not believe that the methods by which\nhypnotic phenomena can be induced-a.ny more than those phenomena\nthemselves-form a distinct class, or can be altogether separated from\nother modes of acting on the nervous system. And I shall therefore\nprefer myself to use a quite general expression, and to speak through-\nout of II stimulation of nervous tracts.\" For all these nervous changes\ninvolve. at any rate to begin with, some sort of stimulation, and it is\npresumable that few or none of them \"ffect the whole brain, or the\nwhole nervous system, in an identical manner throughout. But after\nmaking these explicit reservations I must ask the reader to bear them\nin mind once for all,-since their repetition in every paragraph would\nrender this paper, already cumbrous, altogether unreadable.\nOnce more. In the remarks which follow I shall class as II hypnotic\"\nor as \"quasi-hypnotic\" certain phenomena which may seem to have\nlittle connection with tae familiar phases of the hypnotic trance-to be\nmore plausibly referable to the all-embracing category of hysteria. In\n& survey such as I am attempting, some such laxity of demarcation is,\nI think, unavoidable I am not going to attempt a formal definition\neither of hysteria or of hypnotism-an attempt from which those\nwriters have abstained moat carefully who have had the widest\nacquaintance with both affections. The word hysteria, as has been\noften remarked, designates a mere congeries of nervous symptoms. We\ncannot deduce these symptoms the one from the other j we cannot\npresent them as radiating from a central lesion. And as regards\nhypnotism we are scarcely more advanced. We have not reached-we\naball probably be long in reaching--a.ny physiological conception which\ncan co-ordinate ita Protean phenomena. From the view which would\nclau the II nevrose hypnotique\" as a mere branch of hysteria I dissent\nstrongly and altogether. I hold emphatically that hypnotic changes\nare primarily physiological rather than Fathological j-Bupemormal, let\nme say, rather than abnormal j that while on the one hand they may\ngradate imperceptibly into hysterical and epileptic instabilities, yet on\nthe other hand they may resemble, or even surpass, the beneficent and\ndevelopmental changea which follow \" judicious moral and physiCII.l\nregimen.\nBut while thus repudiating a conception of hypnotism which seems\nto me to nlIIult from a too exclusive practice amollgsub.ie.OaO)~.Y\nDlgltlzedby~i )8le\n\f142 On Telepathic Hypnotism.\ndiseased, I admit, and even maintain, that the French hospital experi-\nmeats of the last few years have thrown much additional light on the\nconnection between hypnotism and various abnormal states. They\nhave shown us intermediate cases, interchangeable symptoms, un-\n~uspected transitions of every kind. As the briefest way of illustrating\nwhat I mean I will describe a single case of Dr. Pitres'-a case which\nseems to stand just halfway between what is definitely hysterical and\nwhat is definitely hypnotic.\nAlbertine M., one of Dr. Pitres' best hysterical subjects,l is liable,\nbeyond the ordinary hysterical accidents, to a rarer a.ffection of her\nown. Every now and then she irresistibly falls asleep. Her sleep is\nperfectly placid, her pulse and respiration normal. Closer inspection\nreveals two singularities. Her eyelids constantly tremble. A limb\nraised into the air remains in the attitude where it is placed. Both of\nthese are characteristically hypnotic symptoms. And yet more con-\nclusive characteristics remain. Speak to her, and she will reply.\nSuggest hallucinations, and she will adopt them. Blow on her eyes,\nand she will awake.\nThis seems the description of a spontaneous hypnotic trance. And\nwhen we learn further that Albertine can in fact be hypnotized by\nordinary means, and that in the induced hypnotic trance and in this\nspontaneous trance she presents certain phenomena both of anlllSthesia\nand of sensibility to metals which she presents in no other state, the\nidentity of the two trances may seem established.\nYet Albertine's history shows us that the \"attaque de sommeil \" is\nin reality the survival or residue of hyster<Hlpileptic attacks of the\nordinary kind, which have disappeared under tl'f\\&tment. When she\nfirst came under Dr. Pitres' care she sutlered several times a day from\nsuch attacks, preceded by a complex aura, and including a ph0.a6\nepileptdide, a plKUJe de cO'1l\/IJUlaions cloniques, and a phase dilirantB. In\nthe phase delirantB, (like many similar sufferers,) she maintained the\nattitude imposed on her, and could reply to questions, and was\nsusceptible of provoked hallucination. And gradually the attacks have\ndwindled down, so to say, into the phase delirante without the delirium,\n-into ~he state of gentle sleep, which has never yet spontaneously\nterminated, in which I first described her. The prodromic aura.\nremains recognisable; but this too has suffered transformation; it has\nassumed a more prolonged, a more psychical character; it is diluting\nitself, if I may so say, into a J,Ilood of mind.\nI have thought that this concrete example might best illustrate the\npoints of contact between hysterical and hypnotic states. In what\n1 See his two tractates, Des slIggestion. hypnotigllu (18M); Des zonu\nAy.Urog~nes (ISS5).\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fOn Telepathic Hypnotism. 143\nfollows I shall keep as far as possible to what must be deemed hypnotic,\navoiding, at any rate, the distinctly morbid causes, the distinctly\ndeg6'Mrative phenomena, to which the name hysterical is with least ques-\ntion to be applied.\n\u00a7 8. Let us try, then, to arrange the various modes of hypnogeny\nin the order of their simplicity.\nAs simplest of all I should place mere mauive stimulation.1 I\nsuppose that most animals and most men are capable of being\" thunder-\nstruck \"~ being thrown into a state which our ancestoro called\nridet-ation, and which we now call cataplexy. 2\nIt has been pointed out that it is probably in some state of this\nkind that animals really are when they are supposed to be \" shamming\ndead,\" the shock of terror having exhausted for the time their nervous\nenergy, and rendered them incapable of motion.\nThis is the condition so often induced at the Salptltriere, where the\nsudden sound of a gong, or a bright light suddenly introduced, will\nthrow many of the bystero-epileptics into a quasi-cataleptic state. The\nIccmographie de la SalpetrUre, and Dr. Paul Richer's treatise on La\nG\".ande Hy8tbie, contain striking pictures of this sudden conversion of\nthe excited woman into the senseless statue. A crash of a brass band,\nthe bark of a dog, will sometimes check the fierce volubility as if a\nspring had snapped. As in Virgil's battle of the bees,\nHi motus animorum atque hrec certamina tanta\nPulverls exigui jacm conpressa quieseunt.\n'JUs instantaneous inhibition may be made useful in various ways.\nOne of Dr. Paul Richer's plates represents a whole string of women\nassembled to be photographed, and then immobilised in attitudes of\nastonishment and terror by a sudden stroke of the gong. On one\nocca&ion a thief was accidentally detected by this method. Her hand\nwas in a drawer when a gong sounded, and she was found some time\nafterwards dumbly and fixedly grasping the pilfered goods.\nMadame B., I may add, was herself susceptible to this form of\nmassive stimulation. On April 24th, while she was in the sleep-talking\nstate, a clap of thunder was heard, and immediately induced in her\n1 In opposing m8.8llive to localised or to specialised stimulation, we shall\nof course remember that all stimulation is more or lesslooal and more or less\n'Special in character. Under m8.8llive stimulation I place the cases where the\nquantity seems more operative than the quality of the stimulus applied. With\nBOrne subjects shook of any strong kind seems equally effective; others will\nrespond to feeble 8timulations of special kinds, but are unaffected by the loud\nnoises, bright lights, &c., which are here ranked as m8.8llive stimuli.\n, This word was coined, I believe, by Preyer, and applied to the condition\n()f hens staring at a chalk line; but it is now more commonly used for lIudden\nnervous shook which immobilisell the subject.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f144, On Telepathic Hypnotism.\nviolent convulsions and marked opisthotonos of the usual hysterical\nkind.\nThese experiments on the cataplectic effect of massive stimulation\nhave naturally been made for the most part either on animals or on\nhysterical subjects, who can be thus impressed by shocks which (like the\ngong's sound or the electric flash) are in themselves insignificant, and\nleave no injurious results. To apply the requisite degree of shock to a.\nhealthy subject would be quite indefensible. But occasions of terror\nand astonishment will sometimes spontaneously arise; and real life offers\nmany an intermediate stage between the minute of stunned bewilder-\nment and the stupO'l\" attonitus of the asylums, where one over-\nwhelming moment seems to hll.ve paralyzed the mind for ever after.\nShocks of this generalised kind can admittedly initiate almost a.ny\namount of visceral, circulatory, va.so-motor disturbance. It is, therefore,\nantecedently probable that other hypnogenous methods-being, as it\nwere, secondary or specialised forms of general shock-will be able to\nexercise a powerful influence of this same kind. Remembering (say)\nthe effects of fright on a rabbit, we need not be surprised that in Dr.\nLiebea.ult's prs,ctice on the impressionable poor of Nancy hypnotic\nsuggestion should be found a cheap and easy substitute for cathartics.\nRemembering that a stn.rtling disgrace may set up diabetes, we need\nnot think it incredible that slight temporary bleeding or blistering\nshould follow the conlmand impressed on a previously-sensitised subject.\nOn purely analogical grounds it is, I think, probable that every con-\nstitutional disturbance (and some such disturbances result in good, and\nnot in evil) which sudden shock can produce, will be capable of being\nreproduced or adumbrated among the results of technically hypnotic\nmethods-of methods, that is to say, which by concentration and\nspecialisation economize the amount of shock necessary to affect the\nsystem. And here it may be well to point out that I am classing the\neffect of sudden shock as hypnotic, although such shock does not,\nperhaps, directly produce the most interesting phase of hypnotism,-\nnamely, the sleep-waking. or somnambulic state. l It directly pro-\nduces the two phast's known as catalepsy and lethargy,a and some-\n1 Despine (Etude Scientijiqllc SliT Ie aomnamblliiame, p. 2(5) cites a case\nwhere a fright induced first ..

I may say here that though on\nsome important points I cannot bring myself into accord '\\\\ith the school of the\nSal~tri~re, I recognise in the fullest manner that theirs is the leading collection\nof instances; that Dr. Richer's book embodies a greater mass of skilled\nobservationof these abnormal states than is contained in any other single volunte.\nDr. F~re's numerous and important observations have issued from the same\nschool.

And this (with M. Richer) I\nconsider amply enough to rank sudden shock among hypnogenous\nagencies. No one can feel more strongly than I the primary interest of\nthe somnambulic state. But it is not a CO'IUItant element in the\nhypnotism produced hy any method whatever. There is, in fact, no\none symptom which by itself can be taken as essential to a hypnotic\ncase. As the results of sbock we have cataleptic retention of attitudes\nimpressed on the limbs, open and fixed eyes, anaesthesia, suggestion\nfrom gesture, contractures, increased muscular irritability,-all these\nin various combinations, suddenly checked by means which dissipate\nhypnotic states, and leaving no trace in the memory.. This is enough,\nI think, to justify us in treating the effect of .hock as a kind of rude\nprimary type of hypnotic change.\n\u00a7 9. Next in order to general shock, or the change or exhaustion\nproduced by maanve stimulll.tion, may be placed monotOf&l)U8 stimulation,\nas from the tick of a watch, &c. This is usually alleged to be much the\nsame thing-the exhaustion being now effected by repeated small\nstimuli, instead of by a single stimulus of excessive strength. 1\nThe process is an interesting one, though it has not often been\nsuccessfully applied. Itis noticeable that Dr. P. Richer dismisses it in\na few lines when he is discussing the various methods in use at the\nSalpetriere.2 Yet monotonous stimulation is frequently spoken oflI.S if\nit were the lI.Ccepted type of hypnotic procedure. What is the reason\nof this 1 The reason, as I take it, is a curious and complicated one;\nnamely, that two common modes of procedure have been classed under\nmonotonous stimulation, whereas this phrase is an inadequate descrip-\ntion of one of them and a misleading description of the other. The\ntwo modes of procedure to which I refer are Braid's upward and inward\nsquint, and the \" passes \" of the ordinary mesmerist.\nAnd first lI.S to Braid's method of the fixation of the gaze on a point\nabove and between the eyes. It is at once obvious to anyone who tries\nthe experiment that the sensation thus induced is totally different from\nthe sensation of hearing a watch tick. The ordinary person will not he\nhypnotized by either the one or the other, but, while he will very soon\nbecome unconscious of the watch's tick, he will feel a constantly\ngrowing and very peculiar fatigue as he continues the upward conyer\u00b7\ngent gaze. This fatigue is, of course, in pa.rt merely muscular, from the\nstrain put simultaneously on the twointernal recti muscles, but there is\n1 I do not myself feel sure that the exhaustion usually alleged in snch cases\nactually exists. I think that the ticking is very likely a mere form of suggestion.\nLife is full of monotonous stimuli (the movement of the screw in a steamer, &c.)\nwhich very many people have attended to for long periods, without any record\nof trance thus induced.\nI La (hatKle H!I~. p. 530.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f146 0\"\" Telepathic Hypnotism.\nalso an ache which can be imitated by sharp pressure with thumb and\nfinger on each side of the root of the nose, and which partly results, &8\nI conceive, from the actual pressure of the ball of the eye against the\nnerves of the orbit--when the eye is, as it were, jamm.ed into the\nposition into which it normally sinks gently in sleep. And the\ncorrectness of this interpretation is sustained by two fa.cts,-one well-\nknown, and the other a personal observation of my own, which I\ndoubt not that many other persons have made before me. The first\nfact is that mere pressure on the hall of the eye (prusion del globes\noculaire8) is a. frequent method in France for inducing hypnotic trance,l\nespecia.lly in hysterical subjects. The secoild fact is that a pinch applied\nto the root of the nose, or a strong pressure between the eyes, is often\nsimila.rly effective in the mesmerisation of healthy subjects,-more\neffective than the\" pa.sses,\" whose monotony is sometimes deemed so\nessential.i\nAnd passing on from these closely-analogous pressures, we come\nnext to Richer's pressure of the vertex (first advocated by Dr. Richer\nin 1878), which he finds to produce hypnotic trance and contracture;\nand the pressure on the heads of hens, which the practical henwife\nemploys before any operation of minor surgery on her restless brood.\nThe jealously-concea.led attOUCMments of Rarey,-perhaps even the\ncruder practice of dropping leaden plugs down the ears of horses,3_\nbelong to the same category. And these lead us on to Pitres' and\nCharcot's doctrine of \"hypnogenous zones,\"-specia1 points, that is to\nsay, which are found (symmetrically arranged or otherwise) on the\n1 M. Las~gue is cited as the originator of this method.-Ricber, op. cit.,\np.524.\nI The precise mechanism and effects of the upward and inward squint have\nnever been satisfactorily worked out. Professor Ma.calister has kindly promised\nto make certain poat'11WT'tem experiments bearing on these points, and to com-\nmunicate the results to the Society. Pending an exacter inquiry, he thinks it\npossible that the forced upward gaze involves a strain on the capsule of Tenon,\nand consequent drag on the sclerotic, with intra\u00b7ocular tension of the vitreous\nchamber;-88 well as intra-orbital pressure on certain branches of the fifth\nnerve. If this be 80, Braid's squint would C01\/lbi1U~ the intra-ocular tension of\nthe French pressure of the eyeball, with the pressure on the fifth nerve which is\neffected by squeezing the root of the nose. I find that this squeeze is used\nempirically for checking hysterical a.ttacks, quite apart from any belief in\nII zones hysMro-fr.!natrices.II It is a familiar fact that the same PreMure arrests\na sneeze.\n\u2022 Of course the stupifying effect of sudden deafness is operative here; but\n_ Dr. Taguet's C&Se (Ann.

As we shall see\nlater on, this amounts to saying that Braid's squint is a form of localised,\nrather than of mcnwtorwus, stimulation.\nSecondly, as to the passes of the ordinary mesmerist. Here, as it\nseems to me, there has been a curious antagonism of theories, extreme\non one or the other side, whicb has obscured the actual phenomena\nencountered in practice. On the one side the ardent believers in a\nCI vital efBuence\" have often exaggerated the importance of \"passes\" j\nhave often spoken as though every detail of manipulation produced a\nseparate specific effect. And, on the other side, opponents of Mesmer's\ntheory have sometimes been anxious rather to explain away the effect\n1 I cannot go into the elaborate experiments which Charcot, Richer, Pitres,\n&c., have made on these ..zones hypnoglmes, hysterogenes,\" &c. But a few words\nmay indicate the connection thus established between hysterical and hypnotic\nphenomena. There have been few observations of the kind in England, where\nhystero.epilepsy is comparatively rare, and in the following sentences I shall\nmainly follow Dr. Pitres. If a hYlltero\u00b7epileptic patient be carefully examined\nit will almost always be found that there are one or more points or tracts\npressnre on which either provokes or arrests the hysterical attack. Among these\npoints are often the top of the head. the ball of the eye, the orbital region ; just\nthe points with pressure on which we are 80 familiar in hypnotic experiment.\nThat these points are not merely imagined by or suggested to the patient is\nshown by such incidents &8 the fall of hair growing thereon, or by their acci\u00b7\ndental discovery while the patient is unconscious. [See 11.180 eh. l<'ere in the\nProgru Mtdical, 1882, p.42.] They disappear temporarily under the inflnence\nofelectricity, local anremia, &c., and have lIometimllll been permanently abolished\nby 6Uggution in the hypnotic trance,-another indication of their kinship with\nhypnotic changes. Patients pOlllltlBlling these zones are 11.180 frequently exposed\nto attacks on hearing some word which recalls a particular set of memories,-\nthe specialised suggestion having the same effect &8 the localised prellllure. [See\nPitres, Des zone, hYBUrog~nu, p. 30.] Furthermore, on the same or other patients\npoints are frequently found, pressure on which will not produce a hysterical\nattack, bnt will produce a. Kleep of the nature ordinarily cl&K8ed &8 hypnotic, or\nwill modify the phaKe8 oflIuch a sleep, or will awaken into ordinary life patients\npreviously hypnotized by other means. [These last points are styled\nAypIW-jrtnatricu ; for they check, instead of generating, the hypnotic trance ;\nbut I shall avoid all terms not absolutely needful.] Sometimes a Blight prellllure\non a certain point in<luces a hypnotic trance (which can be conducted through its\ncharacteristic ph&llell), while a VWlellt prellllure on tile same point induces\nhysterical convulsions. Galvanism, local anremia, hypodermic injections,\n&c., are found to abolish for a time the hysterogenous zones but to leave the\nhypnogenous unaltered. On the whole, it would seem that the hypnotic effects\n818 not indeed a mere branch or a mere commencement of the hysterical effects,\nbut are neverthel_ related thereto in a manner &8 yet unknown.\nDigitized by G~le\n\f148 On Telepathic Hypnotism.\nof such passes than to explain it, rather to show that no vital efBuence\nwas proved thereby than to determine by experiments of their own how\nmuch of truth alight lurk in those enthusiastic assertions. And since\nthese mesmeric passes were of the nature of slight stimuli to sight,\ntouch, or hearing, many times repeated, it seemed that monotonotu\n,timulation was an obvious and sufficient cause for the effect produced.\nYet I venture to say that persons who have themselves practised\nthis form of hypnotization will be inclined to ascribe its effect to any\none of several causes rather than to the monotony of the procedure.\nAs commonly practised now, by Dr. Litfuea.ult, for instance, who has\nmesmerised some thousands of persons during the last 20 years,\nthe passes and touches made are brief and variable, and although Dr.\nLitfueault was till lately a strong opponent of Mesmer's theory, his\nactual experience prevented him from crediting the results of his pro-\ncedure to monotonous stimulation, and he ascribed them rather to\nw.gge,tion, to the concentration of the subject's mind on the idea of\ngoing to sleep.1\n\u00a7 10. And, in fact (as I have implied above in spEl&king of the\nvalue of pressure between the eyes), there would often be much more\nreason to attribute the effect of mesmeric manipulation not to mere\n\"passes\" but to pressure on a hypnog6fl()tl,B zone, of which I have\nalready spoken, and which, under the heading of localised stimulation,\nI would place next to the massive and the monotonous stimulation\nwhich we have already considered. For here we have a pressure ap-\nplied to certain points or tracts, empirically discovered and varying in\neach case, which serve, as it were, as the trains of gunpowder to fire,\nif a nervous explosion is to be induced. I speak of a nervous explosion,\nbecause these specially~ndowed poilits are more often hysterogenouB\nthan hypnogenous,-thll.t is to say, it is oftener possible to induce Ii\nhyste~pileptic attack by localised pressure than to induce a mere\nhypnotic trance.\n\"I have shown,\" said Brown-Sequard,1 who was one of the first to\ndraw effective a.ttention to th6116 zones, \"that certain points in the cere\nbro-spinal centres are able to cause the disappearance of the properties\nof other parts of the nervous system; and that the same or other points\nare endowed with another property not yet studied, by virtue of which\nirritative lesions of these points can augment the activities, or intensify\nthe properties, of more or less distant parts. The influence thus\nmanifested is d1lnamoqenic.\"\nAs an instance of well-defined inhibitory points, I will cite the\ncase of Louis V--. In him, as in most cases of hysterica.l\n1 Du J07nmeil et du ttat, analoguu, p. 18, &c.\ns Camptu RendU8 de l'AM&mie de8 Sriencu, March 29th, 1880.

So long as the finger remains pressed to the forehead he\nis senseless and motionless,-\" suspendu et inhibe\" altogether.1\nHere then, by a localised pressure of the simplest kind can be\ninduced at once the very maximum of inhibition. And here again. as\nin the case of massive stimulation, I would point out that we may well\nexpect that a number of minor phenomena and earlier stages of sleep\nmay in other cases he produced by a method which, in one case at\nleast, is so profoundly effective.'\nThe subject of localised stimulations is one of wide importance in\nthese studies. I must refer the reader to the researches of Brown-\nfWquard, Pitres, and Paul Richer, and will merely observe that we\nhave here a specialised hypercp.8tMM of a very significant kind. It\nappears that the peripheral terminations of various nerves, without\ninducing any modification of the surface which is obvious to ordina.ry\ninspection, have acquired the power, when preasure is applied to them,\nof setting on foot definite and varied processes of systemic change.\nThe effect produced by touching some of these inhibitory points can\nonly be compared to the effect of an electric shock.\n\u00a7 II. And this brings me to the fourth head of my enumeration of\nhypnogenous agencies.\nWe have diacuased the 11IlJ8nve stimulation of the whole nervous\nsystem; monotO'1'UYlJ.B stimulation, tactile, auditory, or visual, and\nlocalised stimulation of specially sensitive points, anyone of which\nmethods may induce in appropriate subjects the state of trance.\nAnd now we come to a class of cases where the agencies-still testify-\ning by the suddenneas, vigour, and specificity of their effects to the\nexistence of certain internal tracts of supernormal sensibility-gradually\ncome to indicate something as yet unreached. They gradually cease to\nbe mere exaggerations of influences felt by ordinary persons,-they show\npowers of affecting the organism poaseased by substances which we have\n1 Dr. Brullard, of Nancy, has met with a case where the mere closure of\nthe subject's eyes,apparently by any person, induced BOmnambulism.-Brullard,\n~ gtnerale8 BUr Neat hypnotique, p. 84, (Nancy, 1886).\nI Madame B.'s two thumbs are hypnogenollR points.

The effect\nof medicamentous substances, in mere contact, is so extending our\nconception of hyperresthesia that the effect of metals in contact is not\nso absolutely isolated a conception as when it was first observed that\nthe touch of gold or iron induced or removed spasmodic rigidity.\nI must confess that in this region I depend entirely on the experi-\nments of others. I have seen nothing myself of a nature to persuade me\nthat the external application of a substance habitually inert when th1l8\nexhibited can have any effect upon the nervous system. Nor can I\nhere enter fully into the evidence which has nearly convinced me that\nluch is the case.l It must suffice to say that the advocates of these\nspecific influences (almost all of them French medical men) seem to me\nto be at present in possession of the field j and that the palmary case\n.'.\n1 The question as to the possibility of proving the in1luence ot metals, &0..\nseems to stand somewhat as follows.\nOn the affinnative side it is necessary to show that,-\n1. Definite resthesiogens have produced definite and constant effects, while\nother substances have produced no effects.\n2. The subject bas not been aware (either by pennission or by fraud) of\nwhat the substance under trial was.\n3. There has been no suggestion, by any word or gesture of the operator,\nthat any given result was expected. To this it is desirable to add a\nfourth condition, namely,\n4. That the operator himself has no expectancy of the result attained. This\nlast proviso is meant to guard against thought-transference. Unl-,\nindeed, there is some independent evidence of thought.transference\nbetween the operator and subject, this explanation can hardly be\npres8ed; but I suspect, nevertheless, that thought\u00b7transference has\nvitiated many experiments.\nOn the negative side it has sometimes been shown :-\n1. That on some subjects any substance indifferently produces the suppoeed\neffect (e.g., mWltard, Dr. Adler, of Berlin, in .. A contribution to the\nStudy of the Bilateral Functions,\" &c., in British Medical Journal,\nVol. i. of 1879).\n2. That many cases depend on suggestion only; e.g., Dr. Hughes Bennett,\nBritish Medical Journal, Vol. ii. of 1878., p. 759 [only one case cited).\nDr. Carpenter, BritiM Medical Jou,.,ud, Vol. ii. of 1871, p. 867.\nDr. Reynolds, Lancet, Vol. i. of 1877, p. 728.\nThere have, no doubt, also been instances of fraud, though I cannot find any\ncue cited in deta.il.

One is the\nconfirmation which certain earlier experiments--English, French, and\nGerman_y, for instance, those recorded in the Zoist--a.fford to these\nmore recent and exact observations. Mr. Gurney and I have else-\nwhere pointed out (Proceedings, Vol. lIT.) the reservations with which\nDr. ElliotBon's evidence in the Zoist should be taken-his eagerness to\nascribe any improvements in his patient's health to mesmerism;\nhis impatient neglect of the precautions necessary to establish a real\nconnection of cause and effect. But though he had the faults of a\nheadstrong temperament, there was no doubt either as to his capacity\nin 1877 by the Lancet in an editorial (Vol. ii. of 1877, p. 646) as valid, was\naltogether inconclusive.]\nIt must be remembered that suggestion is undoubtedly a vera call~ of effects\nof this kind. In some ca.ses the metals may be really inert, and the suggestion\nmay produce all the effects. In other cases the metals, &c., may be operative,\nbut suggestion may either exaggerate or counteract their operation. The ques-\ntion is whether there are or are not cases where suggestion is excluded, and I\nthink that there is a sufficient residue of such cases to justify a provisional\nbelief. Without going exhaustively into the subject, it may be enough to give\nthe following references in support of this view.

It is that if thE-se specific influences of a long\nrange of substnnces, some of them previously supposed to be inert (as\nhere applied) in reference to the human organism, be admitted, then it\nhecomes far more readily conceivable that the human organism itself is\nnot inert in reference to another human organism ;-that there is some\nspecific vital influence such lIS the mesmerists have claimed.\nIn Dr. Berjon's tractate we find records of the influence on\nLouis V--, and on a female pa.tient, of the following sllbstances or\nforces. With contact: Copper, platinum, gold, hydrogen, sulphate of\ncopper, potassium bromide, potassium iodide, sulphur, antimony,\nammonium, chloride, carbonic acid, electricity (dynamic and static) ;\nmagnet: human hand. Without actual contact: Gold, mercury,\nhydrogen, chloride of gold, acid nitrate of mercury, cyanide of\nmercury, su)pha.te of iron, perchloride of iron, iodine, opium,\nchloral, and other narcotics; tartar emetic, &c. ; scammony and\npodophyllin; champagne, and other alcoholic drinks; valerian,\ncantharides, camphor, jaborandi, piloca.rpin; magnet; or a human\nhand held near the body.\nI See, for instance, his paper on ..

But there is a difficulty here.\nNitro-benzol is to ordinary senses pretty nearly identical in smell with laurel-\nwater,-and is, in fact, habitually used in the cheap confectionery and other\ntrades as an inexpensive substitute for oil of bitter a.\\monds, the scent of prussic\nacid being precisely reproduced. But the!<e two subjects, the Jewess and\nLouis V--, invariably distinguished nitro-benzol from laurel-water, and acted\nconsistently in each c&lle. There was a remarkable hyperresthesia of some kind,\nand, considering the effects of the non-odorous substanCe!<, it is far from clear\nthat the ense of smell was even in this case primarily concerned.\nDilute nitro-benz I provoked conv ulsive shocks of the arms, and movements\nas though of drawing with 0. pencil.

The first experi-\nments were made with metals, which were applied to the skin, to see\nwhether transference of the hemiplegia could thus be produced. Lead,\nzinc, and silver produced no effect. Copper produced a temporary\nreturn of sensibility, and a temporary vaso-motor modification, so that\n& prick on the skin which had not previously bled, bled while &\nsheet of copper was superposed. Platinum produced an itching sen-\nsation, but no transference. Steel produced transference. Gold\nproduced transference, but along with the transference it produced\nsevere pain. The objective character of this influence of gold was shown\nby a curious incident. Dr. Mabille one day supported Louis V-during a\n\"crise,\" and the doctor's gold ring touched the patient's hand for several\nminutes. When the epileptic recovered consciousness he complained of\npain in that spot, a \"brftlure\" appeared there, and the redness lasted\nfor several weeks. \"Lea pMnomimes physiques persistants,\" says Dr.\nviRion.

The effects produced were curiously connected with\nhypnotism by the fact that though they often constituted a crisis which\nleft no waking memory, and could not, at its height, be suspended by\nhypnotization, yet when the effect of the drug was declining it was\npossible to throw the subject into the somnambulic state, and then to\nobtain from him lUl account of the sensations which the drug had pro-\nduced. The effects of the several drugs were roughly analogous to\ntheir known effects, but presented some new and constant features. It\nis claimed that these characteristic effects were produced when the\nexperimenter was not aware what drug he was holding in his hand;\nnay, even that when the experimenter was mistaken as to what drug he\nheld in his hand, the phenomena were still such as the drug &9tually\npresented should induce.\nThese experiments are still under discussion; nor have I myself\nseen any effects of this kind which might not have been due to sugges-\ntion. Nevertheless, as already implied, the evidence for the specific\neffect of contact with gold, for instance, on certain subjects seems to me\nvery strong; and I therefore recur to the point urged above; namely,\nthat it seems not unreasonable to suppose that if a human body is 80\nabnormally sensitive as to enter into contracture at the touch of gold,\nand to distinguish gold by contact alone, or by proximity alone, from\nother metals, it may not be altogether insensitive to the touch of another\nhuman body--a.nother centre, that is to say, of forces and perceptions\nlike its own.l\n1 Between susceptibility to metals, &c., and susceptibility to the influence of\nli'lJing bodies, susceptibility to the proximity of dead bodies would occupy an\nintermediate place. Perhaps we may thus explain the following narrative\nsent to us &8 a ..ghost story\" of unusual type and good attestation. It comes\nfrom Mrs. Wheeler, 106, High-street, Oxford, who is known to Mr. Podmore.\n.. In the summer of 1874 we moved into the house we now occupy, 106, High\nstreet, Oxford. We had the house on lease for some years, but had never lived\nin it, having let the upper part of it.\nWe took &8 our bedroom the lower of two roolUJ)itbaUi>~\u00a3)Q~way at\n\fOn Telepathic Hypnotism. 155\nRather it seems probable that just as the hypnotic effect of mere\nmassive or mere monotonous stimulation may be connected by the\nintervening link of localised stimulation, with the hypnotic and other\nneural effects of the contact or even the proximity of specific inanimate\nsubstances or specific non-vital forces. viz., magnetism and electricity,\neven 80 may these specific effects be themselves connected with the\nspecific effects of vital contact, vital proximity.\nthe side of the house. On the first night that we slept there I woke up just at\n12.45 (I heard a church clock striking the quarters), with a feeling that there\nwas something terrible up in the roof. I don't know what it was, but I lay\nawake with this feeling for nearly an hour, and then I woke my husband\nand told him of it, and he fetched me some brandy.\nI found, however, that I could not shake oft' the feeling and go to sleep again.\nI ClOuld not even stop in the room, but came out into the sitting\u00b7room, and sat\nup there until 5 a.m., when I went back to bed. I did Dot have the horrid\nfeeling at all when I was out of the room.\nThe next night I woke again at 12.45 a.m., with the same dreadful feeling,\nthough not quite so bad as the first night. The same thing happened night after\nnight for some weeks, and I woke up at the same time with the same feeling of\nsomething horrible up in the roof. I did not sleep any night, I believe, from the\ntime lawoke-12.45-tiU after 5 o'clock.\nOnce, I remember that I went up into the passage over our room, and tried\nto get at the space under the roof, but found that I could not do so; and once, in\nthe day.time, I tried to get into the space under the rafters, through the bed\u00b7\nroom, where there had once been a means of communication, but I found that it\nwas built up, and that I could not get there.\nAt last my health would not stand it any longer, and I went away on a visit\nto a brother at Cambridge. Whilst there, I heard that the roof over the two bed-\nrooms had fallen in, and forced a. bedstead through the floor of the upper room\ninto our own bedroom. That I took as a sufficient explanation of my feeling of\nhorror.\nIt was not for some weeks afterwards that I learnt by accident (my husband\nhad purposely concealed the fact from me, fearing the eft'ect on me in my weak\nstate of health), that the dead body of a child had been found, hidden under the\nrafters of the roof, over our bedroom. The body was dried up like a mummy,\nand the head was twisted round. It WIIo8 evidently the body of a new\u00b7bom child\nthat had been murdered and placed there for concealment.\nELLEN M.

June 11th, 1883\u2022\n.. In the summer of 1872, my father occupied a rectory house not far from\nBlisworth, in Northamptonshire, for a few weeks, and I went down to spend\nthree days with him and my mother at Wltitsuntide ; my two children and their\nnUlse being already there. The room given to me was over the dining-room;\nnext door to it was the night nursery, in which my nurse and children slept,\nthe rest of the inmates of the house being quite at the other end of a rather long\np&HS&ge. I hardly slept at all the first (Saturday) night, being po88IlII8ed with\nthe belief that ROme one was in my room whom I should shortly BIl\". I heard\nnothing, and I saw nothing. The next morning, Sunday, I did not go to\nchurch, but betook myself to the dining-room with a book. It was, I remember,\na pelfectly lovely June morning. Before I had been a quarter-of-an-hour in the\nroom, and whilst wholly interested in the book, I was seized with a dread, of\nwhat I did not know; but in spite of the sunshine and the servants moving\nabout the house, I found it more intolerable to sit there than it had been to\nremain in the room above the night before, and RO, after a struggle, and feeling\nnot a little ashamed, I left the room and went to the garden. Sunday night was\na repetition of Saturday. I slept not at all, but remained m what I can only\ndescribe as a state of expectation till dawn, and very thankfully I left on the\nMonday afternoon. To my father and mother I said nothing of my two bad\nnights. The nurse and children remained behind for another week. I noticed\nthat the nurse looked gloomy when I left her, and I put it down to her finding\nthe country dull, after London. When she returned she told me that she hoped\nshe would never have to go to stay in that house again, for she had not been\nable to sleep there during the fortnight, being each night the prey of fears, for\nwhich she could not account in any way. My father left this rectory at the end\nof the summer; and some time afterwards he was talking of the place to me,\nand mentioned laughingly that before he entered it the rector had \u2022 thought it\nright to let him know that that end of the house in which I and JOy children\nwere put up was said to be haunted, my room especially, and that several of hill\nvisitors-bis sister in particular-had been much troubled by this room being\napparently entered, and steps and movements heard in the dead of night. I do\nnot like to let you come in,' he added, 'without telling you this, though my\nown belief in it is small.' Within, I think, a year or 18 months at most of my\nfather's leaving, the house had to undergo considerable repair, and amongst\nothers, a new floor had to be laid,in the dining-room. On taking up the old\nboards four or five (I forget which) skeletons were found close under the board-\ning in a row, and also close to the hearth-stone.\"\nSome analogous cases are recorded by Stilling and other writers. This\nphysical explanation would apply only to a small pro~rtion of the narra-\ntives sent to us as indicating the continued oP!!~~y ~~ persons.\n\fOn Telepathic H'!fP'1Wtism. 157\nHere again we may most conveniently begin with its most advanced\nor conspicuous effects,---cases where the mere utterance by a casual\nbystander of one special but apparently harmless word, like \"frogs\" or\n\"telegram,\"l throws the subject instantly into the convulsions, delirium,\nand insensibility of a hystero-epileptic attack. At first sight this might\nseem the strangest of all effects of verbal suggestion; yet it is soon seen\nto be a mere iutensification of familiar phenomena,-an exaggeration of\nthe brain's reflex irritability quite in keeping with the other exaggerati0'f&8\nwhich characterise the hysterical state.\nWeare all fanliliar with the extraordinary sensitiveness which a\nparticular group of memories may acquire in healthy minds,--the\nmother's sudden start, at her child's wail, from the slumber which her\nhusband's snoring has left undisturbed,-the access of blinding uncon-\nsciousness to the surrounding scene which follows on the casual mention\nof some secretly-loved or secretly-dreaded name. Here, then, the touch,\nso to say, which falls on a definite region within the brain,-the region\noccupied by that hypersensitive group of memories, - produces an\neffect analogous to the effect produced by a touch on some hypersensitive\nperipheral tract,-sa.y the drum of the ear or the scar of an old wound.\nAnd just as this natural or traumatic sensitiveness of particular points\non the surface is (so to say) parodied and exaggerated by the morbid\nand arbitrary sensitiveness of the hysterogenous zone, and the patient is\nthrown into convulsions by a touch which would merely have tickled\nthe healthy subject, even so the instinctive or acquired sensitiveness\nwhich certain groups of memories in most of us possess is parodied and\nexaggerated by the morbid and arbitrary sensitiveness of the girl who\nbecause her companions once put frogs in her bed cannot hear the word\n\" frogs\" without a hystero-epileptic attack.\nIf then we can thus compare the hysterogenoUB suggestion to the\npressure on a hysterogenous zone, may we compare the h'!JP'TW!le'1WU8\nsuggestion, which more directly concerns us, to pressure on a h'!lprw-\ng6'll()'U8 zone t To a great extent I think that we may. Note in the first\nplace that hypnogenous suggestion is not really so simple and easy a\nthing as is sometimes represented. I doubt whether it is ever the case\nthat fl()'TI,-hysterical patients can be hypnotized for the first time by a\nmere verbal command, without the gaze or touch or will of the\noperator. I think that all that we can fairly My is that when a subject\nhas been previously hypnotized by other means, or has previously under-\ngone hysterical attacks which involve, or at least predispose to hypnotic\nchanges, that subject can often be hypnotized again by the mere verbal\nrevivification of that group of organic memories which have been origin-\na.ted by the previous tra.nce. If this be so, the hypnogenous suggestion\n1 Pitres, Des Z()1lU HysUrogtnes, p. 30 .. . Gooole\nDigitized by \"\n,\/\n\f158 On Telepathic Hypnotism.\nwould be allied to the hysterogenous suggestions somewhat as the\npressure on the one class of zones was allied to the pressure on the\nother,-the lesser IIJld more definite effect not being, indeed, a mere\nbranch or commencement of the larger and more confused effect, but\nbeing related thereto,---say somewhat in the way in which the act of\npressing the foot on the pedal of a piano is related to the act of sitting\non its keyboard.\nBut the hypnotic suggestions with which we have to deal comprise\nmany other suggestions besides that of falling asleep. They comprise\nthe definite hallucinations. the definite commands, of which we have of\nlate had so many examples. But here again it would be a mistake to\nassume that induced hallucinations, for instance, are a mere outcome or\nincident of the hypnotic state. Rather we may say that even as\npl'8SSUre on the pedal modifies the loudness and continuity of the sounds\nproduced by striking each individual note, so (and in a much greater\ndegree) do the general nervous changes of the hypnotic trance increase\nthe definiteness, isolation, persistency, of the faint instinctive impulse\nto belief which follows when we hear a statement confidently made.1\nHallucinations, though more easily induced in hypnotized ptlrsons, can\noften be induced in persons in the waking state, who have previously\nbeen hypnotized, and sometimes on persons who have never been\nhypnotized at all. I have myself repeatedly made a certain subject\nbelieve for a minute or two that she both saw and smelt a hole singed\nin her dress by an imaginary coal, although I could not hypnotize her,\nnor had she ever been hypnotized by anyone. The sight of children, or\nthe remembrance of one's own early childhood, is enough to explain this\nstate of mind. I can remember my own feelings at four years old, when\na respected elderly friend stated that he was a bear, and simulated to\nsome slight extent the movements of that quadruped. I knew all the\ntime that it was Mr. S. ; but the idea of bears, pre-existing in my mind,\nwas so strongly stimulated that I was paralyzed with terror. It was an\nincomplete hallucination, induced not in a hypnotized but in an im-\nmature brain by a definitely-localised stimulation-- by a touch on a\ngroup of exciting mental pictures which experience had not yet\nsufficiently partitioned off from the milder scenes involving only o!d\ngentlemen and sofas.\nThe susceptibility to suggestion, then, which characterises the\nhypnotic trance, involves in effect an exaggeration of the sensibility of\ngroups of images within the brain, which-in the absence of control\nfrom inhibitory or co-ordinative centres-{fevelop with greater readiness\ninto hallucinatory perception, impulsive acts. Observe, however, that\nwith hardly any subject are all suggestions equally efficacious.\n1 See Bernheim \"De la suggestion cialUl l'ttat hypnotiql\" et daM fMat de\nveille,\" (Paris, 1884), on this topic.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fOn Telepathic Hypnoti8m. 159\nEven when the operator seems to have obtained complete con-\ntrol-to be able to prompt a well-bred subject to theft and\nmurder-he may still be unable to prompt to rudeness or indecorum.\nThe explanation of this odd fact I take to be that the nexus of habit\nwhich opposes the infraction of rules which we constantly obey, though\nconstantly in a position where we could break them, is stronger than\nthe nexus of habit which opposes an act which we theoretically\ndisapprove, but have never been within measurable distance of\ncommitting.l\nSomewhat similarly, we find that hypnogenous zones generally occur\nin seldom-touched parts of the body, where the habitual link between\nsensation and responsive action is not strongly established.\nI venture, then, to suggest that were the whole plexus of brain-\noperations unrolled before us, we should see the specific sensibility\ngaining one ideational centre after another, as suggestion is repeated,\nvery much as one point after another on the periphery may become\nmodified into a hypnogenous zone. And the stimulus of appropriate\n8uggestion,-still in the first place peripheral, as given by voice or\ngesture,through ear or eye,-touches, as I conceive, a hypnogenous tract\nwithin the brain, and though no longer ma.ssive like the gong, makes\nup in precision for what it lacks in volume and intensity.\nThus far I am supposing that the subject will accept the suggestion\nto sleep, or other suggestions, with equal readiness at anyone's command.\nBut this is not universally the C80se,-with healthy English subjects is\na.lmost never the case. Far more frequently there is a. further\nspecialisa.tion,-again a specialisation without the subject supm-added ~\nthe .pecialisation withi\" him,-and we find that he can only be\nentranced by certain definite persons,-possibly by one person alone\namong very many who make the attempt.. On what does this difference\ndepend 1 What are the qualities in that complex entity, the hU,man\n1 Different subjects vary greatly in this particular, affording sometimes, as\nProfessor Beaunis has observed, a singular insight into the relative vigour of\ntheir inward motives. Some experiments of Mr. Langley's on animals,\ninteresting in this connection, are described in his paper \"On the Physiological\nAspect of Mesmerism,\" read before the Royal Institution, March 14th, 1884.\n\" In man,\" he says, \"the phenomena of mesmerism are of a very much more\nstriking cha.raeter than they are in the lower animals. Speaking generally, this\nseems to be due to a greater interdependence of the various parts of the nervous\nsystem in the lower animals. In these, when anyone centre is stirred up by\nexciting impulses, an irradiation of exciting impulses is apt to take place to all\nother centres, and the mesmeric state is in consequence apt to be broken. And,\non the other hand, when a centre is inhibited, an irradiation of inhibitory\nimpulses is apt to take place, and the whole nervous system is in consequence\napt to be inhibited. Hence the activity, or suppression of activity, of particular\nparts of the central nervous system, which forms so conspicuous a feature of\nmesmerism in man, can be only partially produced in the lower vertejltates.\" I\nDigitized by GOog e\n\f160 On Telepathic H'!J'P'notilrm.\noperator, whose presence or absence involves these difFering degrees of\nhypnogenous efficacy f\nHeidenhain has suggested that differences in warmth or moisture\nbetween the I~ of various operators are enough to account for these\nvariations in power. To say nothing of other objections to this view,\nit is disproved by the fact that the touch or immediate proximity of the\noperator's hands is by no means an essential part of the mesmeric\nprocess. Again, this apparent electivity has been explained by sugges-\ntion of the ordinary kind-a.s though when A can entrance a suhject\nand B and C cannot, this were because the subject had an idea to begin\nwith that A alone could entrance him. But this view also has been, I\nthink, sufficiently disproved by experilDents on unconscious persons, on\nsleepers, and on young children.\nAnd if previous suggestion-preconceived idea cannot explain the\nfact of entrancement by one special person rather than another, then\nneither can it explain the incidents of the rappO'1't which continues to\nexist during (or even after) the trance between the subject and the\noperator thus elected. That rapport shows itself in various ways.\nThere may be a special sensitiveness to the operator's voice, so that his\nmere whisper is heard and recognised amid a Babel of other sounds.\nThere may be, as in Dr. Taguet's case and in several of Elliotson's\ncases, a special sensitiveness to the Bcent of the operator, recalling the\ndog's power of discovering articles which his master has touched.\nThere may be a vaguer sensitiveness to his presence,~r even, as I\nam inclined to hold, to his mere approach,-:till the perception verges\ninto what can no longer be called hyperleStbesia, but rather a clair-\nvoyance or clairaudience, which does not strictly follow the lines of\nany special sense, but specialises itself in what seem arbitrary and\nunexpected ways, and detects qualities which have never before proved\nso directly discernible.\nAnd, moreover, besides these sensory (or supersensory) elements in\nthe mesmeric rappO'1't, there is commonly what is called a psychical\nconnection as .well, an obedience of the suhject to the operator's\nwill, and his will only-a. concentration of the enthralled attention into\nthat single channel.\nVarious as are these phl'nomena., and impossible as it at present is\nto co-ordinate them adequately, I may perhaps venture to give to all\nof them alike the title of \"selective hypel'll!Sthesia,\"-implying that\nthe sensitised organism of the subject responds to one particular class\nof stimuli with more than normal readiness, and in other than normal\nways. And I should compare the special sensitiveness to the operator's\nscent or voice to Louis V--'s sensitiveness, say, to opium in mere\nexternal contact j while the subject's sensitiveness to obscurer facts\nconcerning the operator (as his mere approach or his maladies) may be\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fOn Telepathic HypnotiB'l1t. 161\nparalleled with the sensitiveness of other subjects to the touch or\nproximity of gold, or of other substances which, when thus exhibited,\nare ordinarily inert.\n\u00a7 14. May not this notion of selective hyperRl8thesia, when carefully\ndwelt upon, suggest to us that the\" mesmeric rapport,\" the\" vital\neffluence\" of which Elliotson, &c., were wont to speak as of a single\nforce or entity, may in reality be a varying complex of different\nelements 1 and that among these elements may be something which\nis neither \"will-power\" nor \"character\" in any psychical sense, but\nsimply the specific effect of the proximity of certain living organic com-\npounds 1 The subject feels Brown's\" influence\" and not Jones's, or feels\nBrown's influence soothing and Jones's distressing. But Brown and\nJones, whatever else they may be, are at any rate aggregates of organic\ncompounds, and it is possible that to these hyper-sensitive per-\nceptions, Brown may differ as much from Jones as podophyllin from\njaborandi.1\nAnd thus we gradua.lly find ourselves led up to the conception of\na vital influence or effluence by a method which does not present this\nvital effluence as a unique, isolated, incomparable force, but rather 8.1\nan advanced term in a series of influences, each one of which needs\nto be discovered by direct experiment, while the discovery of anyone\nof them corroborates the efficacy of the rest. It is in this way, perhaps,\nby gradually fitting together a number of results obtained at\nseparate points of a far-reaching line, that modem science has the\nbest chance of confirming whatever may be sound in the interesting but\nenigmatical experiments of Reichenba.ch,~xperiments which the\nwriters in these Proceedings have never consented to set aside as\nillusory, though we have thus far found them almost impossible to\nrepeat.\nReturning to the special inquiry on which we are now engaged,--aB\nto the true modus operandi of hypnotic suggestions of various kinds, let\nus note the results now reached. We have seen that suggestion in its\nsimplest form-the verbal suggestion of any person taken at random-\nis analogous to the localised stimulation,-stimulation of a simple kind,\nbut applied to particular nervous tracts,-which in some patients\ninduces hypnotic or hysterical phenomena. And we have seen, again,\nthat suggestion somewhat more differentiated,-the verbal suggestion of\nSODlC one person who is alone capable of reaching the subject's attention,\n-is analogous to the specialised stimulation, as from metals or drugs\n1 Dr. Despine maintains (Etltde Scientifiqlte Bltr Ie Somnambulilme, pp. 134,\nsqq.) that .. convulsive epidemics\" are propagated by actual infection,-withont\neight or other snggestion of an ordinary kind.

We come now to the third class of suggestion which we\nmentioned at the outse~ namely aelf-mggution,. giving this name to\ncases where the trance does no~ so far as we can tell, follow on any\nhint supplied to the patient by another mind, or on any external\nstimulus whatever,-where the subject does not suppose that anyone\norders him, or desires him, or expects him to fa.ll into the abnormal\ncondition, but falls into it, a. we say, \"of himself.\"\nThis self-suggestion is one of the most difficult, and one of the\nleast explored, branches of our subject. It involves, in fact, the whole\nconnection between what we call ~ and what we call induced\nnervous changes; and moreover, as is commonly the case when the word\ntpontanllOU8 is introduced, the chief of all dilemmas-jree-will qr\nnecumy I-looms in the background of the inquiry.\nFirst, let us oonsider what are the cases which we have to explain.\nUnder what circumstances do hypnotic or quasi-hypnotic nervous states\nappear without manifest external stimulus 7 I am bound to add the\nword\" quasi.hypnotic,\" for I have insisted on the close connection\nbetween hypnotism and certain hysterical stll.tes, such as Albertine's\n..attaques de sommeil\" ; so that I must face ~he difficulty of their\nori\u00a3inauon as well\nWe find, then, that there are a few cases where subjects can throw\nl.heml8lves into trance by a mere effort of will. There are a few cases\nwhere subjects can maintain themselves in the trance by a mere effort\nof will; and there is a case where a subject in a state of complete\ninhibition originates phenomena otherwise producible only hy the\nItrongeet hypnotic suggestion.\nAgain, we find that there are cases where there is no question of\ndeliberate choice on the subject's part; where the special nervous\nco~dition is hereditary, as in a famous family where \"the sons in their\nnightly discursions ran against and awakened each other\"; or where\nthe trance appears as an idiopathic symptom in an otherwise normal\nperson, as is so often the C&Be with ordinary somnambulism; or where a\ntendency to trance and similar conditions follows upon some definite\ninjury.\nNow I think that moat of these instances may be shown to be\nanalogous to the \"deferred suggestion .. of recent hypnotic experiments,\n-nay, I hold that the perception of that analogy is essential to our\ncomprehension of the experimental \"deferred suggestion \"itself. Thus\nmuch, therefore, I am bound to try to show. But I suspect that this\ni. not the only analogy involved. I suspect that in some of the cases\nof self-suggestion where the element of will is markedly present, we have\nan analogy to another mode of hypnogeny, namely. +n-+.I....... Hi6uction of\n--Di~IitIZ~\u00b7DY~(51'-\n\f0\"\" Telepathic Hypnotism. 163\ntrance by an actual \"vital effluence\" from operator to subject. At any\nrate, whether this be so or no, I feel sure that we shall not get at the\nroot of the matter without trying to realise what would be meant by\nsuch an hypothesis.\nFirst, then, let us try to understand deferred suggesLion, and ita\nconnection with heredity. We start with the fact, which to us is at\npresentultimate, that living matter has a tendency not only to respond\nto a stimulus A, but to be so modified by that stimulus that it there-\nafter responds in a. rather different manner to A, when A recurs--and\nsometimes also to other stimuli, B, C, D. This is rudimentary or\nunconscious memory. As we get higher in the scale consciousness is\nsuperadded, and the memory of A persists while B, C, and D are\noccurring, even if it does not actually modify them. Suppose a physician\nsays to me at dinner, \"You have heart disease; you must go upstairs\nvery slowly or you may die.\" This is a deferred suggestion to me to\nmove slowly when the time comes for me to go upstairs. I need not\nthink of it till that moment comes. But it impresses my mind so much\nthat I continue to think of it while I am merely sitting at dinner-the\nconsciousness of A persists through B, C, and D, though it will only\nmodify my action when the cognate moment recurs-the going upstairs,\nwhich is a sort of A' if the physician's warning were A. Here we\nhave a deferred suggestion, consciously received, and consciously borne\nin mind till the time to work it out in action arrived.\nBut neither of these intrusions of consciousness is necessary to the\nefficacy of a deferred suggestion. In the first place, we know from\ncommon experience that the brain receives many impressions which do\nnot at once rise into consciousness, but do so when a favourable oppor-\ntunity offers itself. Only a small proportion of the impressions which\ncertain powerful stimuli (as incipient asphyxiation or certain forms of\nfever) can summon into retrospective consciousness do actually rise into\nconsciousness at the moment when they are received. These are de-\nferred suggestions, not consciously received. Take the most trivial\nand familiar case. I glance down a list of books to see if a book by\nHelmlwltz is in it. It is not, and I remember absolutely nothing of the\nlist. Some time afterwards I see a book by Herzm advertised. I at\nonce feel that I knew that there was an author of that name. Hi.\nname, in fact, was on that former list, and I unconsciously received the\ndeferred suggestion-only capable of revival by seeing the word\nHenen again-that therEl was a scientific author of that name. Now\ndeferred suggestion in the hypnotic state offers an exaggeration of such\na case as this. I suggest to the hypnotized subject that when he\nleaves my room (after an hour of waking life) he will perceive that his\nhat is blue instead of black, or that he will send a telegram to tell me\nthat it is a fine day. (For my present argument there is no dift'erenqe.\nDigitized by \\.J~9.8le\n\f164 On Telepathic Hwnotillm.\nbetween the suggestion of a hallucinatory percept or of an unmotived\naction.) When the fixed moment comes-the moment whose arrival is\nIlol A' to my suggestion A,-that suggestion recurs and works itself out,\nthough during B, 0, and D, the events of the intermediate hour, no\nknowledge of A was present nor could be summoned into the con-\nscious mind.\nYet between this absurd act and my forgetfulness of the name\nHerzen there is only a difference of degree. In the hypnotic subject's\n080Ie one loom (so to say) in the vast manufactory within him has been\ndisconnected from the general system of driving-gear, attached to\ndriving-gear of its own, and set to turn out a special pattern,\nindependently of the orders executed by the remaining looms in the\nfactory. And similarly in my case the little bobbin (so to say) with\nthe name Herun, inscribed on it, went on spinning by itself without\nconnection with my general scheme of memories. Only it was so small\nan item that its disconnected action and its subsequent attach-\nment to the main system attracted no notice, or, at least, excited no\nsurprise. Deferred hypnotic suggestion, in fact, like the immediaU\nhypnotic suggestion of which I have already spoken, is an advantage\ntaken of the increased di880Ciability of mental elements which results\nfrom the inhibition of certain co-ordinative mental centres or activities\nin the hypnotic trance.\nThere are other conditions also in which suggestion can take a\nhold of the mind which the co-ordinative centres cannot check. I have\nspoken already of the excessive sensitiveness of certain groups of\nmemories in childhood; for instance, the idea of bears. Well, this\naensitivene88, prior to the age of co-ordination, may be taken advantage\nof to effect a deferred as well as an immediate suggestion. J uat aa my\nfriend who told me that he waa a bear, gave me for the moment some-\nthing approaching to a hallucinatory percept of himself as a bear, so\ndo some nurses talk to children about ghosts in a way which implants\na deferred suggestion of horror in traversing churchyards, which no\nadult reason can overcome.\n.. Trunken mURen wir aIle sein ;\nJugend iat Trunkenheit ohne Wein,\"\nsays the poet. And just aa youth, with its strong irredective impulses,\nits organic exhilaration, resembles the state of incipient intoxication, so\ndoes childhood, with its ready receptivity and want of co-ordinative\npower, resemble the hypnotic or sleep-waking condition. By hypnotiz-\ning the adult we restore to him the trustfulness of childhood, much\naa by slightly intoxicating the elderly we restore to them (aa Plato\nhaa it) the vigour and enterprise of youth.\nThere is, however, a state in which we are even more susceptible to\nsuggestion, have even less of co-ordinating faculty, #If. MlliIlUWl power,\nDlgltlz<!(j oy GUU01~O\n\fOn Telepathic Hypnotum. 165\nthan either in childhood or in the hypnotic trance. I allude to\nour condition before we are born-to the period at which\nthe various looms are actually being placed in our manufactory, in\nrough accordance with the arrangement of similar looms in the factories\nof ancestral minds. And we most of us know to our cost that\nalthough we may improve the working of these looms in detail we have\nlittle power to modify their general type, or the principal driving-\ngear which connects them. And, to take the defect with which we are\nnow concerned, some original weakness in that driving-gear may\nsubject us to hystero-epileptic attacks, with their concomitant hypnotic\nphenomena.\nI have perhaps said enough to explain what I mean by extending\nthe analogy of deferred suggestion to this wide range of hereditary and\n(so-called) spontaneous manifestations of hypnotic phenomena. The\nimpulse, as I hold, which ultimately induces those phenonlena, has been\nalready given to the organism,--either in that organism's first inception,\nor during the course of life,-in much the same way as the hypnotizer\ncan communicate the impulse to sleep, or to perform some act, at a\nfuture moment which he determines by his own choice.\nIt is probable that many of those who accept this analogy at all\nmay cousider that it covers the whole extent of. self-suggestive\nphenomena. They Dlay think that spontane0U8 cases include voluntOll1l\ncases, as a mere sub-division distinguished by the concomitance of a\npurely subjective sensation of clwice. They may say that the pre-\nexistent conditions of the organism determine in every case-in the\nso-called voluntary cases as fully as in the involuntary-the phenomena.\nwhich that organism proceeds to manifest.\nI do not here directly controvert this view; but I cannot help\nsuspecting that there ia a difference between hypnotic phenomena\nwhich occur spontaneously and those which seem self-induced by a\ndirect effort of will ;-or at any rate that this second class, in the ap-\nparent mode of their operation, afford an analogy with the influence\nwhich the \"silent will\" of an operator can sometimes-as our experi-\nments have gone to show--exert on a sensitive subject.\nI am not sure, however, that such words as will, 'l'Tlental effort, and\nattention, are the right words to use in such a connection. I think\nthat we must not take for granted that this influence is necessarily\naccompanied with ordinary consciousness on the agent's part. It ap-\npears, for example, that a person himself in the sleep-waking state\nean mesmerise another person,--exerting apparently the same kind of\ninfluence, and the same kind of volition in directing it. as a normally-\nwaking man can exert. Yet, in the case to which I specially allude, when\nthe sleep-waker \"came to himself\" he was quite unconscious that he\nbad mesmerised-and had for 110 long time refused to demes~O~e\nDigitized by ~UUglt::\n\f166 0'1'\/, Telepathic Hypnotism.\nother subject. It would seem then that in considering the genesis of\nhypnotic phenomena which are apparently self-induced, yet not p~\ncisely spontaneous, (as hereditary hysteria is spontaneous,)-we shall\ndo well to consider phenomena originated in various nervous conditions\nbesides that of normal wakefulness.\nI shall cite three ca.aes. In the first the subject was in a state of\ngeneral \"suspension and inhibition\" profounder than any ordinary\nphase of the hypnotic trance. In the second the subject was already\nhypnotized. In the third the subject was in the normal state.\nThe first of these three ca.aes may seem from one point of view to\nbe eminently involuntary,-eminently a. ca.ae where the previous history\nof the organism determined the recrudescence of an impressive scene.\nBut-as will be seen-it has some puzzling features. Oddly enough\nwe have here, and here alone, an actual suggestion made in so many\nwords by a man to himself ;--a.nd here, too, we have the remarkable\nproduction, without external stimulus, of those va.so-motor dis-\nturbances which form at present the extreme limit of the hypno-\ntizer's power over the subject's physical organism. Who could\nexpect the somnambule to direct his spontaneous energy to the produc-\ntion of hremorrhage or vesication' Yet the history of Louis V--, one\nof the most important documents which Nature has ever submitted to\nthe psychologist, affords an example of self-suggestion pushed to this\nalmost incredible length.\nIn the first place it must be explained that, according to the\ntestimony of four physicians who have tried experiments with Louis\nV-- at two separate asylums,l hremorrhage and bleedingstigmata can\nbe evoked in him by e:cte'1'nalsuggestion. The first recorded experiment\nof the kind was as follows. The patient being in the somnambulic\nstate, one of the doctors said to him: \"At four o'clock you will fa.ll\nasleep, come into my study, sit on that chair with your arms crossed,\nand bleed at the nose.\" The crossing of the arms was, of course, to\nprevent his touching his nose. When four o'clock came he fell into\nthe hypnotic trance, went and sat in the chair with his arms crossed,\nand after a few moments began to bleed at the nose.\nAgain, the doctor traced the subject's name on his two fore-arma\nwith a blunt instrument, and told him, in the somnambulic state,\n\" At four o'clock you will go to sleep and bleed on the lines which I\nhave traced on your arms.'>t Shortly before four o'clock he was\nSee Drs.

At four he fell\nasleep, and on his left (non-paralysed) arm the tracings stood out in red\nrelief, and a. few small drops of blood oozed from them. On the right,\nor paralysed, side, there was nothing apparent.\nAnd this leads us to the phenomenon of self-suggestion on which I\nwish to dwell I translate from Dr. Mabille's paper, read at the\nCongres scientifique de Grenoble, 1885, and reprinted in the Progre.\nM6iical, as already cited. \"On August 5, 1885, at my visit, about\n8.30 a.m., in presence of Dr. Ramadier, assistant physician of the asylum\nof Lafond (La Rochelle), and of M. Chauvelot, house-physician, I\nplunged V-- into somnambulism, and, anxious to check his sleep-\nlessness, I said to him: 'This evening, at eight, you will say to the\nattendant, Ernest: \" Ernest, come and help me to bed, I want to sleep.\"\nThen you will go to bed and you will sleep till five in the morning.\nDuring your sleep you will hear nothing, see nothing, feel nothing.\nYou understand me, V--1' , Yes, sir.'\n\" At about 7.57 p.m.,V--,who was walking in the court.yard, stood\nstill with a fixed gaze, underwent some slight convulsions of the face, as\nis usual with him when the moment fixed for a. suggestion draws nigh,\ncontact. We do not, in fact, know how far V&80-motor reflex excitability may\ngo in the production of phenomena analogous to the so-called .. tache ct!rebrale,\"\nor red mark produced by pressure on the skin in many morbid conditions. It\nwould have been more satisfactory had Dr. Mabille, &c., explicitly taken\naccount of this possibility. Nevertheless, it certainly appears:-\n1. That Louis V-- was so frequently touched in various ways that any\ntendency to tache cerebrale, or subcutaneou8 hremorrhage, must have\nbeen observed; and if the marks lasted for m(mtM (as is recorded of\nthe marks on the arm, Berjon, p. 36), he must haye been covered with\n8uch marks.\n2.

The tache cirebrale,\nso far as 1 know, appears within two or three minutes after the touch, if\nat all.\n3. Professor Beaunis' experiments (Recherches Expbimentales, &c., Paris,\nBailliere, 1886, p. 29) on the production of redness and cutaneous conges-\ntion on Mlle. A.

Here\nalso Professor Beaunis does not 8tate that he tried whether other points\ntouched without 8uggestion would become equally red, no doubt con\u00b7\n8idering that it was obvious that Mlle. A. E., who leads an active life,\nwas not thus affected. Fortunately, on Sept. 3, 1885, I had myself an\nopportunity of trying the experiment on this 8ame subject. I quote\nfrom Mr. Gurney's note made on the same day:-\n.. Mlle. A., hypnotized by M. Liebeault in about three seconds, and\nimmediately afterwards most severely pinched by E. G. on the arm,\nwithout giving the slightest 8ign of sensation. Liebeault 8lightly\npricked the knuckle of the middle finger of the right hand, and told her\nthat a patch of rednC1!8 about the 8ize of a 5O\u00b7centime piece would form\nthere; and also that a similar patch would form on the corresponding\nDigi\n\f168 On Telepathic Hypnotisrn.\nand fell into the sleep, or rather int.o that intermediate state which M.\nDumontpallier has described. His hyperresthesia of the left side dis-\nappeared. He repeated to his attendants the words previously cited,\nand at 8 p.m. precisely slept profoundly. From that moment onwards,\nwhile I was unable to wake him, for he saw, hl'ard, felt nothing, and\nthe pressure of his hysterogenous zones had no effect, V-- spon-\ntaneously renewed this series of experiments to which he had been\npreviously submitted. Thus, he pressed with his fingers on the balls\nof his eyes, as if to be thrown into lethargy, opened his eyelids to pass\ninto catalepsy, rubbed the top of his head to pass into somnambulism,\nand entered on the following dialogue, putting the questions and\nmaking the answers himself.\n\"Q. You hear me 1 A. Yes, sir.\n\"Q. Give me your arm. A. Yes, sir.\nto Q. V--, a quarter of an hour after you wake there will be a V on\nyour arm at the place which I mark (here he marked a place on his\narm), and it will bleed. You understand, I wish it to bleed. A.

M. also gave her a scratch on the ann, in order to\nsee whether this would also become red after a short interval. She was\nthen woke, and in about 15 minutes the patches had formed as pre-\ndicted ; that on the left hand being a little less red and distinct than\nthat on the right. Half an hour after this both marks had completely\ndisappeared. There was no redneBB where the scratch had been given.\nMlle. A.'s hands were not under the strictest scrotiny throughout, but\nshe was close to us, and talking during the whole time that elapsed\nbetween her waking and observation of the patches, and anything like\ncontinuous robbing must, we think, have been noticed. M. Liebeault\nhas complete confidence in her integrity, and all his experience of her\ngoes to show that she retains no memory on waking of what has paBBed\nduring her hypnotic sleep. \"\nThe following roles, I think, should be observed in experiments of this\nkind :-\n1. Before aBSerting that a result is obtained by 8tlgglJ8tiOll alom, repeat the\nexperiment on the same subject with all the other circumstances, but\nwithout the suggestion.\n2. Before aBSerting that a result is due to a particular procus alom (as\nshutting or opening the subject's eyes, robbing the top of the head, or\nspecial points on the head, &c.), let that proceBB be repeated on a\nsubject who does not know what to expect by an operator who has no\ntheory on the subject whatever.\nThe rigid application of these rules might, I fear, reduce certain well-rounded\ntheories to a somewhat lean and scrappy condition.\nProfessor Delbmuf (Revue PhiloBophigtte, August, 1886) has amusinglyshoWD\nhow readily one subject will imitate while entranced the hypnotic 'phenomena\nwhich he has observed in another.

Loud snores then indicate that\nhe is asleep. Then, about a quarter of an hour after this dialogue V--\nwas seized with the crisis which we usually observe in him when the\nstigmata have been suggested to him. At the end of this crisis we\nexamined his arm and we saw a V, and the V was co\\'ered with blood.\nThis hloody effusion WII.S produced at a place where a V had been sug-\ngested by me on August 3, in the presence of Drs. Barth and Delarue,\nof La Rochelle, according to the method of Drs. Bourru and Burot.\n\"The same phenomena were twice produced during the same night, in\nthe same place, and by the same procedure. V-- then awoke exactly\nat 5 a.m., without knowing that he had been asleep, and with the convic-\ntion that he had just been picking flowers in the garden of the asylum.\nWe have here, then, a hremorrhage produced during induced somnam-\nbulism, without any external agency, in the place of the pre-existing\nstigmata, by wha.t I think I may call auto-suggestion. And this auto-\nsuggestion (as well as all the other phenomena. which I observed during\nthe night of August 5-6 in the presence of Dr. Ramadier and M.\nChauvelot) was of cortical origin, since the initiation of peripheral im-\npressions was for the time suppressed. It was like the awakening and\nexteriorisation of sensations already stored up in the organism.\"\nHere at last, I may observe incidentally, is the true explanatory\nparallel to the case of Louise Lateau. Here is a case where there is\nno pretence of miracle and no possibility of fraud; a case where the very\nmechanism of stigmatisation is laid bare from beginning to end, and\nthe asylum-patient retraces the doctor's visit with the same reality of\nstarting drops of blood with which the pious ecstatic renews the story\nof the Crucifixion}\nPassing from this exceptional state of profound entrancement to\nthe commoner phases of hypnotism, I will next cite a remarkable case\n1 The difficulty of keeping abreast of modem experiment,-and the danger\nof confident negations,-are illustrated by the following passage from a little\nbook of Dr. Maudsley's, entitled Natural Callsu emil Supernatural Seeming',\n(London, 1886).\n\" There is not on record,\" he says (p. 261), .. a single well-authenticated\ncase, nor is there any sound argument to justify the preposterous opinion,\nwhich has been broached by some quasi-scientific authors, that these stigmatic\nbleedings might be produced naturally by the exceeding and specific intensity\nof the imagination acting upon the particular areas affected. The supposition\nthat the zinc [in a well-known case of fraud] was perforated by the intensity of\nthe imagination, would be scarcely less preposterous.\" Whether an idea is\nIe preposterous\" or not is a subjectivequestion, and depends on what goes before\nand what behind it in the speaker's mind. But\" quasi-scientific\" is a more\nobjective term; and Dr. Maudaley's use of it here seems to prove that he has not\nbad time to &Cq\\!.aint himself with the experiments of Drs. Bourru and Burot,\nnor with those of Professor &aunis, contained in the RechtrMu E:J:fItrimMiMp\nDigitized byuUU~lt::\n\f170 On Telepathic HY'fYMtism.\nof Dr. Pitrea'l, where the subject, in the somna.mbulic state, was able to\nsuggest to herself that it was imposaible to awaken her.\nDr. Pitrea' subject, \"Albertine,\" (already mentioned,) is liable to\nacceaaea of hysterical aphasia, which she greatly dislikes. One day\nDr. Pitres suggested to her, in the hypllotic trance, that she would be\nunable to speak when she awoke, and would continue aphasic for\n24 hours. The duggestion succeeded; all that day she could not speak.\nSoDle time afterwards Dr. Pitrea again hypnotized her, and made the\naame suggestion. But she rebelled, and aaid that if he persisted in\ngiving her this order she would not let herself be awakened. He did\nnot believe that she could prevent him from waking her, and blew on\nher eyes and tried other accustomed means. Nothing would wake her,\nand he was obliged at last to promise that she should only be aphasic\nfor five minutes. Then he woke her without difficulty. The experiment\n'Was repeated many times.\nHere, then, we have a well-marked case of self-suggestion in the\nhypnotic trance itself. M. Pitres does not state whether Albertine\ncan hypnotize herself, by a. mere effort of will, in the waking state.\nFrom the account given, it rather appears that the trance itself has\nfacilitated the self-suggestion,-that the aame' condition of super-\nnormal susceptibility which renders her subject to the commands of her\nhypnotizer renders her subject also to a command of her own. And I\n'Would point out that this accords with my hypothesis that in self_\nsuggestion the subject may be exercising on himself, from within, a\nforce or influence truly analogous to the force or influence which the\nhypnotizer exercises on him from without.\nPassing on, again, from the self-suggestion of the subject already\nhypnotized to the self-suggestion which throws the waking subject into\ntrance, we find ourselves on a path of \"yogism\" and mysticism which\n'Would lead us far from the present discussion. I shall cite one case\nonly, where the act of will is strongly marked,-the waking choice even\ndetermining the hallucinations which are to adorntheself\u00b7induced trance.\nDr. Liebea.ult I was acquainted with a .. somnambule nail,\"--a deaf-\nmute of the name of Loue, who apparently, even before the scene\nwhich I am about to relate, was able to entrance himself by an effort\nof will. Dr. Liebeault told this man that the dead could appear to the\nliving, and that, if he concentrated his mind on his father, his deceased\nalready cited. Applied to Drs. Bourru and Burot, such an epithet would be\nunwarrantably discourteous. Applied by Dr. Maudaley to Professor Bea.unis,\nit would provoke a smile. But I repeat that it would be unjust to charge any\nBuch intention on Dr. Maudsley,-who wrote, it is clear, in mere ignorance of\nthe recorded facts.\n1 Pitres, Du auggutiom hllpTIotiquu, Bordeaux, 1884, p, 54.\nI Dt, 80mmeil et de, ltats analoguu, pp. 259, 282. . ..

He profited\nalso by his new-found power to procure himself imaginary interviews\nwith living personages of a less sacred character. These interviews,\nthough they also seemed real at the time, he always knew to have been\nmere hallucinations. But as regards the interviews with the dead, the\nkindly doctor, kinder than those unwelcome friends of Horace's\nkallucine,-allowed the poor man to rest in a btVief whose destruction\nwould have robbed him of his most valued joy.\n\u2022Pol me occidistis, amici,\nNon servastis,' ait, \u2022cui sic extorta voluptas\nEt demptus per vim mentis gratissimus error.'\nCases like this,-where choice and effort seem so deeply engaged,\ndo certainly take us far away from the mere \u2022attaques de sommeil,' for\ninstance, of the congenitally-unstable Albertine. They bring us\nface to face with the question: Is this will or attention of\nthe subject's, which he uses to induce the trance, a new force introduced\namongst the forces of his organism from some source independent of or\npre-existent to that organism 1 This, of course, leads us at once to the\nold problem as to the existence or non-existence of anything which\nmay be properly termed a Boul, independent of the known physical\norganism.\nBut, nevertheless, without directly grappling with such a problem\nas this, we can, I think, discern an instructive difference between this\ndirect self-suggestion and the mere accidental stirring or gradual matu-\nration of external excitations received in the past.\n1 A parallel instance of self-suggestiou will be found in the .ArcAivio\nItaliatw per Ie Malatie Nervoae for 1883, Part 4: thus II11JIlmarized in .Ann.\nM~d.-Plf!lch., 1884, Vol. ii., p. 467. co Une fillet1ie de dix-sept lions, a demi\nidiote, est, quelque< heu1\"6lt avant 1& mort de Bon pere. prise d'un BOmmeil mag-\nDetique; hallucinations celestes (?).

In that case the new force will be a vital force\nexercised by himself on himself; and its nearest apparent analogy will\nbe to the assumed vital force which Dr. Liebeault can exercise on him.\nNext, let us suppose that he does not, by this act of will, import\nany fresh force from an unknown plane of being. Nevertheless\nhe effects, by unknown means, some kind of change in a previously-\nexisting vital equilibrium. He transforms some kind of latent capacity\ninto a force which, after intermediate steps unknown to us, ends by\nthrowing him into that special condition into which the \"vital\ninfluence\" of an external operator can also throw him. May we\nnot, then, here again conjecture, as the simplest way of correlating the\ntwo phenomena., that the self-suggestion which sends the subject into\nsudden trance, at the biddUtg of his mere caprice of the moment, may\ninvolve some disengagement within him of the same force which, when\nexercised upon him from without, is that very \"vital influence\" or\n\"eflluence,\" in whose real existence we have independent grounds for\nbelieving 1\nA few more words may make my meaning clearer. In moat cases\nof successful hypnotism there is some amount of voluntary attention\non the subject's part. He co-operates with the operator by \"fixing his\nmind\" on the process; and, in fact, some theorists have thought that\nhis'fixation of his mind was the sole cause of the effects which follow.\nBut what makes him fix his mind 1 He CMos68 to do so; that is a.ll\nwe can say. And it is this apparent act of choice, this voluntary\ndirection of the attention to a particular idea., which is the stronghold\nof those who maintain that there are mental processes within us which\nare not inevitably determined by physical antecedents. I am not\narguing either for or against this ~ew; I am only reminding the reader\nthat this voluntary attention of the subject's is something separate from\nthe mere reflex psychical response to the operator's suggestion, and that\nit is an element which enters in varying degrees into all inductions of\nhypnotic trance, except those effected by sudden shocks, or upon sleep-\ning, unconscious, infant, or insane persons or animals. And the question\nis whether we can get a little deeper than this mere statement,\nwhether we can detect an analogy between this idiosyncratic impulse,\nthis \"reaction per,o'f\/\/nelle,\" and any hypnogenous agency which a man\ncan exert upon others than himself.\nAnd to this question I tentatively reply that perhaps when I attend\nto a thing, or will a thing, I am directing upon my own nervous system\nactually that same force which, when I direct it ~ anot.her man's\nDigitized by ~oo8le\n\fOn Telepathic Hypnotism. 173\nnervous system, is the II vital influence\" of mesmerists, or the \"tele\npathic impact\" of which Mr. Gurney and I have said so much. And\nwhen I say \"directing the force on my own nervous system,\" I am not\nspeaking of myself as a kind of angelWl rector without and above my\norganism. How the force is generated is an open question in the case\nof the suggestion which I exert within myself as in the case of that\nwhich I exert without myself. But whether the essence of those acts of\nwill, or of attention, be an illation and infusion of forces which do not\npre-exist in my organism, or a concentration or conversion of forces\nwhich do so pre-exist, I urge that that essential element may be the\nsame in the one case as in the other.\n\u00a7 17. Whatever, then, the precise explanation of this form of self-\nsuggestion may be, it forms a step between mere mechanical hypnogeny\nand that \"vital influence,\" which in its turn serves as the starting\npoint for so many fresh perplexities.\nFor no sooner do we fix our attention on what we have defined as\nthe third class of suggestions-suggestions made mentally by persons in\nthe presence or proximity of the subject-than we recognise that the\ntheory of vital influence, already assailed on one side by the advocates\nof a merely mechanical hypnogeny, is assailable also, on the sidefwrther\nfrom ordinary experience, by anyone who should choose to maintain\nthat the true agency which travels from man to man is a cause uncon-\nnected with corporeal proximity-that is to say, that it is never the\n\" pa.ss,\" or the gaze of the eyes, or the touch of the fingers which sends\nthe subject into trance, but always an agency of that unknown\n\" psychical\" kind which our evidence shows sometimes to accompany\nthe exercise of intense t!wught or will.\nThe cases which bring this question into prominence are especially\nthose where the influence of the mesmerist (as in Dr. Esdaile's mesmeri-\nsation of a blind man) has been exercised from the distance of some\nyards, by gazing steadily at the subject.\nAre we to suppose that there was here a real dl'fUlTr.I\"J throppoil-a\nveritable efflux of nervous energy from Dr. Esdaile's eyes, which im-\npinged in some physical manner on the blind and unsuspecting subject 1\nOr was the transfer of a purely telepathic kind 1 and was the direction\nof Esdaile's eyes on the subject \/I, mere aid to concentration of thought\nor will ~\nMesmer would have said that a real efflux from the eyes was here\nthe efficient cause. The writers in the Zoise (including Esdaile himself),\nso fa.r as they faced the problem distinctly, would have made the same\nreply. And recently Dr. Barety (Force Newrique Rayonnante, 1882)\nhas attempted to show that actual \"neuric rays\" are emitted by eyes\nand fingers, which are susceptible of reflection from mirrors, concentra-\ntion by lenses, &c. II Nous croyons,\" he says (p. 37), \"a~il n'y a aucune\n\f174 On Telepathic Hypnotism.\ntemerite a conclure . . que la force neurique . n'est qu'un\nmode particulier de mouvement . qu'elle agit par l'internlediaire de\ncette m&tiere subtile . que les physiciens appellent ether.\"\nI think that there is temerity in such a conclusion, and I do not like\nto see the etl66r-the deus ex machina of a certain school of modern\ntheorists--dragged in, if I may so say, by the head and shoulders, to\nexplain anything, whether physical or psychical, which particularly\npuzzles us. Yet I think that Dr. Barety's experiments should be\nrepeated, and I am quite sure that we can have no a priori certainty\nthat such rays as he alleges do not exist.\nOn the other hand Professor Janet's experiments with Madame B.\n(and many older experiments,) seem to show that the action of thought\nor wish may overbear the influence of proximity, even when operator\nand subject are sitting side by side.\n\"Cette influence de la peusee de l'operateur,\" he says,1 \"quelque\nextraordinaire que cela paraisse, est ici tout afait preponderante, a un\ntel point qu'elle peut remplacer toutes les autres. Si on presse Ill. main\nde Madame B. sans songer al'endormir, on n'arrive pas aprovoquer Ie\nKommeil; au 'contraire, si l'on songe a l'endormir sans lui presser\nla main, on y reussit parfaitement.\"\nProfessor Janet is, of course, alive to the danger of mere suggestion\nin such a case; and (as already mentioned) he goes on to say that he\nthinks that this supposition is met in several wa.ys, especially by the\nfact that in sleep thus induced by will, Madame B. was under the\ninfluence of the person who had really willed her from the next room-\nnot of the person who had been placed near her, and to whom, if\nmere suggestion induced the sleep, that suggestion might naturally have\npointed.\nAgain, in the experiments in which we obtained localised aJl8lSthesia,\nof 110 single finger only, and in a manner which seemed to exclude both\nmonotonous stimulation and expectant attention as operating causes,1\nit nevertheless appeared that it was necessary for Mr. Smith to concen-\ntrate his attention on the subject's finger, as well as to point his own\nfingers towards it. But the concentration of attention did not suffice\nwithout the physical approach of the fingers as well.\nThe approach of Mr. Smith's fingers, it will be remembered, was\nconcealed from any ordina.ry cognizance of the subject's senses. But\nbefore we can be sure of a specific vital influence we have to guard our-\nselves against possible hypercesthesia of the ordinary senses ;-a.nd this\nis difficult to do while the operator, however hidden, is himself present\nwith his subject. We must desire cases where his influence shall in\n1 Bulletim de la Soci~t~ de Payc\/wlogie Pnynologique, Vol. i., p. 27. (Paria,\nAlean.)

The moat direct way, therefore, of testing the reality of \"vital\nefBuence \" would certainly seem to be the so-called \"mesmerisation of\nobjects.\" Personally, I have witnessed very few experiments of this\nkind which led to any positive result i1 but (as Mr. Gurney and I have\nelsewhere insisted,) the testimony of Esdaile and others in the matter is\ntoo strong to be set aside without diligent attempts to imitate their\nproceedings. Yet even here new ambiguities present themselves as our\nknowledge of deferred and of teiepat\/lic suggestion increases.\nProfessor Beaunis, of Nancy,2 gave some counters to Mlle. A.\n(already often mentioned) in her waking state, and said: \"If you at\nany time put one of these counters into a glass of eau rucree and drink\nit, you will go to sleep.\" Mlle. A. forgot the liquid thus ordered. She\ntried wine, water, wine and water, in vain i at last she tried putting the\ncounter into a glass of eau sucrle, drank it, and went to sleep at once.\nThe suggestion, that is to say, which had disappeared from conscious\nmemory was still operative below the threshold of consciousne88. But if\na case like this had occurred before the efficacy of deferred suggestions\nwas understood, it would probably have been thought by the mesmerists\nof the day that the counter had been mesmerised by ProfeBSor Beaunis'\ncontact, and that the eau rucree, for some inscrutable reason, was a\nliquid peculiarly qualified to draw that counter's mesDleric virtues out.\nSo much for the possible confusion between ckferred suggestion and\nf1ital e.flluence. And if we introduce the hypothesis of mental or\ntelepathic suggestion, such' as Dr. Gibert's mental suggestion to\nMadame B., that she should look at a certain book at a certain hour, a\nfresh source of ambiguity is introduced. Suppose that Professor Beaunis\nhad mentaUy sugge8ted to Mlle. A. that when she put the counter into\nMU ftlcree and drank it she would go to sleep i and that this suggested\nresult had actually occurred. It would then look precisely as though the\neau rucru had undergone some mysterious change i whereas the only\nchange would have been that telepathically impre88ed on Mlle. A.'s\nmind by the mental suggestion previously made.\nIt would, of course, be easy so to arrange the experiment as to\navoid possibilities of this kind i but it is important that they should be\nrecognised i for experimenters who have been fortunate enough to\nencounter the rarer phenomena of mesmerism, have often overlooked\nthe precautions which are needful if any conclusive proof of one or\n~her hypnogenous agency is to be acquired.\n\u00a7 19. It is plain that we have here arrived at one of the hardest\n1 See Procudingl, S.P.R., Vol. i., red in Index.\nI &cAercAu Ezphimmtalu, ii, p. 89.

It resolves itselfintotbis: Isthereoneand\nonly one form of influence which is not communicated by the ordinary\nchannels of sense 1 Or is there an influence which is felt by a\npercipient only when the agent is very near him1 and another influence\nwhich the percipient feels equally when the agent is at an indefinite\ndistance 1 Readers of Phanta.lm18 of the Livit&g will see that this .\nproblem-there dealt with on its psychical side alone-presents itself in\nan urgent manner when we attempt to establish an analogy between our\nexperimental results in thought-transference and those spontaneously-\narising impressions or apparitions which sometimes coincide with the\ndeath or crisis of a distant friend. Our parallel halts in so far that we\nhave not yet succeeded in experimentally obtaining (in the sense of the\ndirect communication of a thought, image, or sensation from one person\nto another.) thought-transference otherwise than between persons in\nclose proximity. In P\/ur,nta.\/ml8 of the Living this difficulty has been\npointed out, hut no complete solution has been attempted.1 Speaking\nfor myself only, I am inclined provisionally to accept the hypothesis\nthat more than one form of force, or at least more than one form of\nreceptivity, is concerned in the phenomena..\nThe action of medicaments at a distance-at a distance measured by\ninches-on Louis V-- and others, has led MM. Bourru and Burot to\nsuggest, in a tentative manner, that there may be a zone, immediately\nsurrounding the person of a hyperaesthetic patient, to which his\nhyperaesthesia extends; so that certain objects, when placed within\nthat zone, exercise a direct effect on his nervous system.\nHypotheses somewhat similar have been suggested by various other\nexperiments, and analogy seems to me to point (though not decisively)\nin this direction. On the other hand one obvious objection to the view.\nnamely the complexity which it introduces into the conception of tele-\npathic action, does not seem to me to be important. We have given the\nname telepathy to a mass of phenomena which have in common only the\nfact that they invoh'e transmission of thoughts or feelings from one mind\nto another, without the agency of the recognised organs of sense. But\nit would be rash to go beyond this, and to assume that we have at.\nonce lit on a single, simply-acting force or energy. So long as we can\ndetect forces only by their influence on our8elveB, not on registering in-\nstruments, we are likely not only to ignore what may be the most\ncharacteristic action of each force, but to confuse together disparate\nforces which exert on U8 something of the same effect.\n\u00a7 20. But here, I repeat, we come to one of the most difficult points\nin the whole inquiry. What is the relation between the supersensory\ntransmission of thoughts and feelings in close proximity, and a similar\n1 See Vol. i., pp. 96\u00b79;. Note the case of ,Mr. Sflf.....R..ole .\nDI!J1tlzed byu\\J(J\"\n\fOn Telepathic Hypnotimn. 177\ntransmission between persons separated by the whole diameter of the\nplanet 1\nIn order to answer this question we ought to be able to compare\nvery many cases of telepathy at varying distances. PhantoImB of tAB\nLiving contains, I think, almost all the cases on which reliance can\nbe placed, and they are not yet enough to admit of an assured\ncomparison between the phenomena. which occur (1) between persons\nin contact; (2) between persons in the same room; (3) between persons\nin adjoining rooms; (4) between persons at a distance of less than a\nmile; (5) between persons many miles distant from one another. We\ndo not know where the breaks, if any, occur in this chain; we do not\nknow what is the effect, on the one hand, of a material obstacle\nsuch as a wall, or, on the other hand, of what I may call a psychical\nrapprochement, as, for instance, a previous familiarity on the agent's\npart with the scene where the percipient sits. But (speaking in a\nguarded and provisional manner) we may note the following points:-\n(1) Contact seems generally to facilitate transmission of thought\nand feeling, and the induction of the hypnotic trance.1\n(2) Presence in the same room seems to be essential to most of\nour definite experiments in thought-transference, and to the\ninduction (in the first instance) of the hypnotic trance.\n(3) Presence in an adjoining room has occa.siona.1ly sufficed for a\ndirect experiment in thought-transference; and occa.sionally\nfor the reproduction of the hypnotic trance when it has been\npreviously induced by the same operator.\n(4) Perhaps hypnotisation at a distance is easier when the distance\nis (say) of one mile rather than ten. Perhaps, too, there is a\ncertain difference in the quality of the subject's sensations\nwhen the mesmeriser is at a distance. Thus Mme. B. (in this\nresembling one at least of Mr. H. S. Thompson's subjects2)\nalways professed, not only to feel who it was that was thus\ninfluencing her, but to have a vague senae as of that operator's\npruence in the room. This I heard her say repeatedly in the\nhypnotic trance (in which she seems always to tell the truth\nas to her own sensations), nor has she, as I understand, been\never mistaken as to whether it was M. Gibert or M. Ja.net\nwho had sent her to sleep from a distance.\n(5) Lastly, when the telepathic influence is exerted over long\ndistances we have very much less of direct experiment, but\n1 I need hardly repeat here that cases in which contact is permitted are not\nin theJDBelves a proof of anything beyond unconscious muscular pressure, if the\nimage or action be such as any form of pressure can suggest.\nI Pkanta8ml o\/'Ae Living. Vol i., page 99, and see note. G I\nDigitized by OC}g e\n\f178 On Telepathic HyprwtiSm.\nvery much more of spontaneous apparition. Our distant\ncases include, as we have often pointed out, all varieties of\nobjectivation, from the mere sense of presence, or the \"mind's-\neye\" view, to the actual phantom in apparent bodily form. But\nthough these distant cases offer many phenomena not hitherto\nobserved in experimental or contiguous cases, they present\nalso many points of contact. Sometimes, for instance, it\nseems to be the will of the distant agent which impresses his\nphantasm on the percipient-sometimes the death of a distant\nfriend seems to produce a quasi-hypnotic effect on the per-\ncipient, which, in one case, at least, seems to have amounood\nto a sort of agitated trance.}\nNow there is, of course, a temptation to simplify the problem by\nassuming that in all these cases of supersensory transmission a force is\nacting which in the first place is identical, cognate, or correlated with\nknown forces, and in the seOOnd place is the same for all supersensory\naction whether in contiguity or at great distances. Such expressions\nas \"bra.in-waves\" (Knowles), \"mentiferous ether\" (Maudsley), \"force\nneurique rayonnante\" (Barety), \"ondulationnisme\" (Perronet}-to\nwhich many others will doubtless ere long be added-testify to this\nnatural, though premature, desire to ticket or identify a force which\n(in the opinion at least, as I think I may say, of those who have\nexpended most pains on tracing its effects) cannot at present be\ncorrelated with nerve-force, or with magnetism, or with ethereal\nvibrations of any kind, by any true physical demonstration.\nAnd here, again, there is a temptation to the attainment of some-\nthing of apparent simplicity by a just opposite road. We may say that\ntelepathy is a pll1Jchical agency, and that there is an impassable gulf\nbetween all agencies which can be classed as physical on the one hand,\nand on the other hand, a.ll agencies, whether apparently operating in\nproximity or at a distance, which we can as yet cognise on the psychical\nside alone.\nBut this view seems to me to involve a metaphysical, as those other\nviews involved a physical assumption. I do not like to assume that\nany effect perceptible to human senses is without a physical cause of\nsome kind-a cause, that is to say, which intelligences of adequate\neleva.tion could cognise objectively and deal with mathematically, as\nwe deal with those forms of matter and force which our minds can at\npresent embrace. Such physical cause or basis may no doubt be 80\nremote from our ordinary physical conceptions that the philosopher may\nbe justified in leaving it altogether out of the question, and in dealing\nwith the interrelations of thought and emotion exclusively on the\n1 PhantcumB o\/eM Living, Vol. ii.,p. 42. G I\nDigitized by oog e\n\fOn Telepathic Hypnotism. 179\npsychical side; but it seems to me that telepathy forces us into a\nposition where it is no longer safe to &8Bume any sharply-defined dis-\ntinction of mind and matter,-where we must rid ourselves of every meta-\nphysical preconception and look to experiment and observation alone.\nWe must remember that it is only quite recently that we have\nfrankly accepted a physical basis or concomitant for all the operations\nwhich go on within our own minds. It was in this century that Lord\nJeffrey maintained that \"there is not the smallest reason for supposing\nthat the mind ever operates through the agency of any material organs,\nexcept in its perception of material objects, or in the spontaneous move-\nments of the body which it inhabits.\" And even Mill, as is well\nknown, regarded the concomitance of a neural change with all mental\nchanges as an open question. Weare now pretty well agreed that such\nconcomitance does always and inevitably subsist within us; but we still\nspeak of the interaction of thought and emotion- of the \"world of\nmind\"--as of a realm, or of operations, where no physical basis must be\n&8Bumed. I think it possible that the facts of telepathy may compel\nus to extend our conceptions of physico-psychical concomitance, and to\nface the supposition that though forces may exist, and agencies operate,\nwhich the ordinary materialistic view altogether denies, yet these also\nmay be correlated-though above the limit of our intelligence-with\nthe force and matter with which our mathematical science already deals.\nIt will, of course, be apparent from the line of argument here\nadopted that I do not consider that the problem of the relation of near\nto distant supersensory transference admits at present of even approxi-\nmate solution. Our recorded instances must receive many in addition,\n-nay, our notions of matter and of mind must pass through many a\nphase as yet unimagined,-before we can tell in what degree the\nmesmerist's gaze across the room resembles that strange and mighty\nimpulse which carries the dying father's image across seas and con-\ntinents to his unexpectant child. All that I have suggested is that\nthere is a presumption in favour of BCI'I'1Ul connection, some continuity;\nthat the mingled similarity and dissimilarity of the phenomena at\ndiffering distances is such as may lead us to conjecture the joint action\nof cognate causes in varying proportion--of causes cognate bttt not\nidentical, implying no single capacity of percipience, no Bingle energy\nof communication.\n\u00a7 21. I can but note these points, on which fuller knowledge may\ncome in time. For the present it must suffice to have endeavoured,\nin the pst place, to supply additional evidence of the existence of\ntelepathic hypnotism, or hypnotic suggestion at a distance; and, in the\nNCond place, to trace a kind of series or gradation--often inter-\nrupted, indeed, and largely hypothetical-between the simplest and\ncommonest, and the rarest and strangest modes of hypnotic i~le\nDigitized ~0~(5\nN 2\n\f180 On Telepathic Hypnotism.\nSome of the hypotheses which I have thus advanced may be\n~oneOUB, but they cannot justly be said to be gratuitous. For they\nare advanced in order to correlate certain a.ctua.lly-observed phenomena,\nwhich must bear Bom6 relation to each other, and whose relation can\nonly be properly discuBBed if some tolerably clear scheme is set forth\nas a basis for such discUBBion. I have cast, therefore, the suggestions\nof the preceding pages into a tabular form.\nThere are, indeed, several items in this scheme as to which die\nevidence seems to me at present inadequate. But I include these\nphenomena simply because the authority of competent physicians on\nthe whole supports them. And by competent physicians I mean not\nmen who, though competent in other lines, have made few or no\nhypnotic experiments, but men who having shown medical or\nphysiological ability of a more general kind, have also taken real pains\nto experiment for themselves in this special direction. I am sorry to\nquote so small a proportion of English names ; but the fact is that during\nthe last ten years this inquiry has been very eagerly pursued by French\nMJVCmts, with some success also by Germans and Italia.ns, but by\nEnglishmen hardly at all. I have no controversial aim; and I desire\n. to see the experiments of the French schools repeated and analysed by\nas many English men of science as poBBible.1 But until such experi-\nments are actually made, and reason shown for explaining the results\notherwise than as the school of the Salpetriere (for instance) explains\nthem, I feel bound to disregard the mere apriori negations of men\nwho have done little work of the kind themselves, and are not always\nfamiliar with the work done elsewhere. The di1ference in this matter\nbetween England and France is one which a few years will probably\ndo much to remove. In England '& practising physician is even now\nhalf ashamed of knowing much about hypnotism; the savour of\ncharlatanism still hangs about the topic; and if he writes a book in\nwhich he has to allude to it, he shows more anxiety to disclaim error\nthan to discover truth. Much the same was the case in France, till\nCharcot, Richet, Beaunis, and a few other well-known men took\nthe subject up,-and in Germany, till Heidenhain took it up. The\nfashion has now changed, and the danger in France is now rather of\nover-eagerness to register new extensions of the fascinating inquiry.\nUnder such circumstances, it seems plainly the duty of an English\nstudent to set forth the outlines of the subject as it stands at present,\nnot vouching hastily for results as yet unconfirmed, but illustrating them\nwhenever he can by some observation or redection of his own. Such is\nthe course which I have tried to follow; and the more pains which my\n1 The schools of Naney, Bordeanx, the Salpatriere, and the Pitie are on man,.\npoints strongly opposed to each other.

All the phenomena which I cite are phenomena which have\nreceived strong attestation. If they do not exist, let them be dis-\nproved in detail. If they do exist they must bear some relation to\neach other ; they must be capable of some sort of logical arrangement.\nI shall be grateful for any hints which may em..ble me to improve this\nfirstrough sketch. In the meantime I may at least hope that the\"8ommeil\nadVtancB,\" with which this paper primarily deals, no longer appeals to\nthe reader as an entirely isolated hypnotic marvel. It has been\nconnellted-by questionable and imperfect links, it may be-but still\nconnected with a great number of other scattered hypnotic experi-\nments, which were themselves, when taken alone, scarcely less strange\nand incomprehensible.\n\u00a7 23. Before concluding this paper I must briefly describe certain\nother phenomena which I witnessed in the case of Madame B. Besides\nthe fact of their occurrence in the same subject they have thus much of\nconnection with the topics on which I have so far dwelt, that they\ntend to show how premature at present is any attempt to define the\nlimit of hypnotic phenomena. For the attempt to restrict the nervous\nchanges induced to catalepsy, lethargy, and somnambulism, is, as I hold,\nequally misleading with the attempt to restrict the methods of\nhypnogeny to monotonous stimulation and sudden shock.\nMadame B. exhibits a phenomenon which is curious enough, even\nif it be a mere reflection from the mesmeriser's expectation; while if (as\nM. Janet holds) it is entirely spontaneous, the interest attaching to it\nis very great indeed. When hypnotised she falls, like most subjects,\ninto a deep lethargic sleep, but, even if left undisturbed, she does not\nremain long in that condition. She passes through a kind of circular\nseries of changes, sometimes more and sometimes less distinct, which\nbring her back again into lethargy, only to renew the series once more.\nM. Janet has since described these phenomena at length in the\nRB'IJUB Scientijique, May, 1886,1 I will not attempt to reproduce\nhis article, but will give, in a slightly expanded form, the notes taken\nat the time by Dr. Myers and myself, adopting M. Janet's schematism\nas our basis. The remarks within square brackets show the degree of con-\nfirmation which each point received in our presence. Her first state is-\n1.

I perceive that M. Janet in his article\n(Re1J'U6 Scientiforue) gives them in the opposite order; and says, .. the\npressure of the thumb ma.kes the subject pass through all the states,\nproceeding from lethargy to catalepsy, while blowing on the eyes makes\nher pass through them in the direction of catalepsy to lethargy.\"\nSuch a distinction as that, I am inclined to think, must be in great\nmeasure accidental; some slight association, once set up, probably tends\nto repeat itself more and more readily. And with regard to all these\nvariations, it certainly seemed to Dr. Myers and myself that they must\nnot be insisted on in detail; that the only fact of clear importance was\nthe subject's tendency to pass spontaneously through a cycle of nervous\nchanges, which was no sooner ended than it began again. A similar\ntendency to recurrent states has been observed and systematised by\nCharcot and P. Richer among the hystero-epileptica at the Sal~triere.l\n\u00a7 25. M. Janet concludes his description of Madame B.'s phases by\nsome reflections which I will here summarise. \"Some observers accord\ngreat importance to the phases of hypnotism, and consider them as\nstates entirely distinct; others see in them only insignificant pheno-\nmena produced artificially by the operator. Madame B.'s case shows\nus that the three primitive states (i.e., lethargy, catalepsy, somnam-\nbulism) are not of fundamental importance, since other states CI\\D be\ninduced, in number as yet undetermined, Vthich are equally definite\nand durable. On the other hand, I cannot regard these phases as mere\naccidents; they arise too naturally and recur too regularly for such 8.\nsupposition. I consider them as stages of sleep (degres de 8omfMil)\nthrough which the subject passes in going to sleep and waking up,-\nstages at which it is sometimes possible to arrest her. At each different\nstage, perhaps, different parts of the brain are excited or paralyzed.\nDuring lethargy the brain seems entirely paralyzed, and the con-\ntractures of this period seem to be mere exaggerated spinal reflex\nmovements; then the different cerebral centres seem to awake gradually\n1 La Gmnde Hy.Urie, Dr. Paul Richer, secondeditioJP, P~Il886.

Still, in\nmy view, we need to go much further still. We need to free ourselvea\naltogether from the notion that the stages which a hypnotized subject\npaues through are necessarily de!J1'la de aommeil,-that his changes are\nchanges undergone en a'endormant et en Be rlveillant,-or even that\nthere is likely to be between stage and stage any familiar connection,\nany discernible filiation at all.\nBut with this hint I must conclude. As I have here tried to ana-\nlyse some of the methods of hypnogeny, so also Ilhould have liked\nto try to analyse some of the hypno~ic phenomena thus induced.\nBut this paper is already full enough of disputable matter. My hope\nmust be that it may stimulate other observers to fresh experiment,-\n'though they, like myself, may spell out but a few words of the\nciphered message in which hypnotism writes for us the secret of the\npsychical mechanism of man.\nADDENDUM.\nSince this paper was in print, I have come across a scheme of\nhypnogenous agencies in Dr. Chambard's tractate, Du SomnmnhuliBml\n.,. glnbal, Paris, 1881. Dr. Chambard has since been selected to\nwrite the article on \"Somnambulism\" in the new Dictionnair6 de.\nScWn.cu Mldicalu, and even in his\" these\" of 1881 he speaks from\na good deal of experience in several h'ospitals. I translate his scheme\nbelow. As compared with the scheme which has been suggested in ihis\npaper both its concordances and its variations may afford us some instruc-\ntive hints.\nChambanl's Scheme of hypnogenous processes.\nA.

I.-I object, as already explained, to cl&ssing\" psychical\naction\" separately,as if it were altogether disparate from other\neffects produced on the nervous system. Such a word as\n\" Faith \"tells us nothing, in this connection. Moreover, I\ndo not believe that\" mental inertia\" produces the hypnotic\nstate at all. And\" fatigue of the attention\" should surely\ncome under\" monotonous excitations of hearing,\" if, as I\nsuppose, Dr. Chambard means the kind of fatigue which is\ninduced by prolonged listening to the ticks of a watch.\nB. 2. 111.-\" Simple closure of eyes\" surely does not produce\nthe hypnotic trance on subjects who have never been pre-\nviously hypnotized. I should rank it as one of the sugges-\ntions which succeed only when recognised IlB B'UflUe&tiom, not\nas in itself an efficient cause of trance.\nB. 2. ~. a and b.-Massive stimulations are here confounded with\nmonotonous stimulations. The gaze at an electric light, or\nthe BOund of a gong, is not afeeble stimulus, and need Dot be\nrepeated.\nB. 2. ~. c.-Pre&tJtIII'e, again, is not necessarily a \"feeble\" or\n\" repeated\" form of excitation. Some of D~Chamba.rd'8 own\nDigitized by ~oo8le\n\fOn Telepathic Hypnotism. 187\ncases (Appendix to his tractate) strikingly illustrate the\neffect of a single touch on abnormally sensitive regions in a\nhysterical patient. I doubt the hypnogenous effect of changes\nof temperature. A cold wind will often wake a subject,\n(Esdaile, Elliotson,) but I do not know any cases where a\nmere rise or fall of external temperature has induced trance.\nB. 2. ~. d.-I have already maintained that on whatever cause the\nefficacy of \"passes\" may depend it is certainly not on monotony\nalone. The\" passes\" may often be varied and interrupted\nwithout appreciable detriment. I believe their efficacy to\ndepend partly on the \" vital influence\" of the old mesmerists,\npartly on luggestion,and partly on pressure upon hypnogenous\nzones. Of course, monotonous movement, darkness, silence,\nand the mere efBuxion of time, may contribute to sending\nthe subject to Bleep. But something more than monotony\nwill generally be needed to cause that sleep to merge into\nhypnotic trance.\nB. 2. ~. e.-This su1>-class is plainly referable not to monotonous\nexcitations but to pressure on specially-sensitive zones.\nB. 3.-1 agree with Chambard that the fatigue induced by con-\nvergence of axes resembles the pain felt on compression of the\neyeball. I should class both under the heading of hypno-\ngenous zones. Heidenhain's view that Braid's squint operates\nby altering the cerebral circulation, (which I shall not here\npresume to contest,) is not inconsistent with this classification.\nIt is perfectly possible that some or all of these localised\npressures act by means of a mechanical influence on the cir-\nculatory system as well as by an influence of unknown\ncharacter on the nervous system.\nB. 4.-Chambard's \"actions physiques\" are included in my class\nof \"specialised stimulations.\" I do not like his term; for his\n\" sensorial\" and \"mechanical\" actions are physical too. A\nfresh term is plainly needed to express such actions on the\nhuman frame as that of magnets and those of metals in con\u00b7\ntact (beyond mere effects of weight, temperature, &c.). Pend-\ning the suggestion of a more suitable term I should call such\nactions BUpernormal, as being unusual, but indicative of a more\npenetrating-not a diseased-sensitiveness on the subject's\npart.\nB. 5.-1 entirely agree that the effect of these toxic agencies is\nomalogO'\/UJ to the hypnotic tra.nce. But I do not think that\ntrance dependent on chemical changes (deficient aeration of\nblood, diffusion of volatile ethers, &c.,) should be classed as\ncWrdinate with the trance induced by the hypnogenou~nci611\nDigitized by ~0081e\n\f188 On Telepathic H'!JP'Ttotism.\nalready discussed. In all of those classes the nervous change\nhas been induced without the introduction of any material\nsubstance into the body; and though it is very difficult to\ndefine what agencies are to be called hypnotic, it seems plain\nthat here at least a line can be drawn, and that changes depen-\ndent on wounds or poisoning-on mechanical rupture or toxic\nalteration of the tissues or fluids of the body--a.nnot be\nclassed as hypnotic without making the word too vague to\nbe of any real service'!\nFinally, it will be observed that Chambard, while decisively\nadmitting several non-telepathic agencies which I have noted as ques-\ntionable, (magnet, electricity, &c.), has, of course, nothing to say as to\ntelepathic influences. His scheme, therefore, is in my view inadeqnate\nto cover the cases adduced in this paper.\nI must, therefore, consider Dr. Chambard's arrangement as IhaJloco\n(in his want of coOrdination of psychical and physical agencies); as con-\nlUlled (in his cross divisions, as I have indicated, of the agencies which\nhe does adduce;) and as incomplete (in his entire omission of hypnotizr...\ntion at a distance). But I say this with all respect for what seems to\nme to have been nevertheless a serviceable forward step:\u00b7 If my own\nclassification is thought to be in any degree an improvement, this is due\nto the rapid advance in hypnotic experiment which the last five years\nhave seen, and more especially to new light thrown, (as I venture to\nclaim,) on all these topics by the establishment of telepathy as an a.ctual\nand efficient cause. If my proposed scheme should RO far subserve\nprecision of thought as to lead to its own speedy supersession by some\ntruer conspectus, its object will have been sufficiently attained.\n1 I may perhaps protest here against an OCC&8ional use of the word\n\"hypnotic,\" both in French and English medical writings, &8 a mere equivalen$\nfor \"aoporific\" or \"anre8thetic,I' in &peaking of drugs, &c. This is to obliterate\nthe whole distinctiveness of a word to which it should be our aim to give all the\nprecision possible.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fThe Oalculus of Probabilities. 189\nVII.\nTHE CALCULUS OF PROBABILITIES APPLIED TO\nPSYCHICAL RESEARCH. II.\nBy F. Y. EDGEWORTH.\nIn a former paper I stated the principal problems which this\nsubject presents, and I showed that they are reducible to, or at least\ninvolve the following :-The total number of trials being N, the chance\nof success at a single trial u, Nu = (as near as may be) m, the number\nof successes m+n (m and n both integers); what is the probability of\nat least that degree of SUCOO88 being obtained, supposing that chance is\nthe only agency, under a regime of pure chance. I stated that the\nsolution of this problem depends upon the summation of the last\nN - (m+n)+ 1 terms of the binomial [u+(l- u) ]N. As the approxi.\nmate value of that sum I put the expreBSion-\n~ [1-}:;.(T e-Pdt] ,'Where T= .;;IU(I--U)N;\na formula of very general application in analogous inquiries. The\nconditions on which its validity depends are for the most part fulfilled\nin statistical investigations. They fail, however, in many of the\nproblems which the Editors of this journal have submitted to me. It\nappears desirable, therefore, to take account of cases which lie outside\nwhat may be called the normal case and are not amenable to the\nreceived formula above written. Accordingly I propose 1 in this paper,\nfirst (I.) to take a theoretic survey of the methods appropriate to\ndifferent conditions; and then (II.) to diagnose and prescribe for the\nvarious cases which arise in practice.\nI.\nA distinction of great theoretical importance is between those\ncases where (a) the binomial series which is to be summed (the\nbinomial locus the area under which is to be evaluated) may be\nadequately represented by a probability-curve according to a well\u00b7\n1 For an extension of the following theory, the reader is referred to the\nwriter's paper on ..

In order to see how far a law extends, the proper course is to\nascend to the sources from which it is derived. In this investigation\nlet us take Poisson 2 for our guide. Let us remount to the rugged\nheights from which he reasons down to the simple normal case and the\nreceived formula. While following in his steps let us adopt his\nnotation; observing that his I' is our N, his p is our 1\u00a3, his q is\nour (1 - 1\u00a3), his m is our m +n, his n is our N - (m +n). And we may\nconfine ourselves to the case in which (N+ 1)1\u00a3, or (1'+ l)p, is an\ninteger, both because no theoretical difficulty is presented by the\nabsence of this condition, and because whatever difficulty may arise\ncan, in the researches under consideration, be avoided by taking N\nproperly. This being conceded, we shall have Poisson's p very nearly\nequal to our n, and his r equetable to our T.\nIt is shown by Poisson that the probability of obtaining at least m\nsuccesses, at most n failures, is represented by a fraction of which the\nnumerator and denominator are integrals; the subject of integration\nbeing the same for both, but the limits different: the subject of\nintegration is of the form Het'JW+ 2h\"t +3h\"'t2 +&c.), where h' I,\" h\"'\u2022 \u2022.\nare respectively of the order 1 ~ ~ .... ; if m n and I' be\nJ u U \"2 \/2 ~ 1)\nregarded as of one and the same order.

It is\n+[ n m+l ]i.\n- nlog'q (I'+I)+(m+l) log'p(I'+I) ,\na quantity which Poisson calls k. In the case before us, where n is\nsupposed less than q (1'+ 1) (the number of failures less than what\nmight have been expected), the sign 8 of k is positive. The superior\nlimit of the numerator integral is +00 \u2022 The limits of the denominator\nintegral are \u00b1oo.\nIf we perform the work of integration for the numerator, so far as\nis possible by the ordinary formulre of reduction, we shall find that the\nresult consists of two parts, one under, and the other outside, the\nt The analysis to which I allude is well expounded by Mr. Todhunter at\np. 576 of his H18tory.\n2 See Poisson, RecherChu sur la Probabilite, &c., Chap. iii.\na OJ.

The\nlatter is affected by k in this wise ;-\nH#i[2h\" +3h'''k+4h''(kI+l)+&C.\nThe denominator is independent of k, being of the form 1\nJ-;;H[h' +111.'\"+&c.].\nHence the quotient will be of the form\nj\" ~[ l+l\"+l'v+&:c. ] + ;\"1)\"+),\"k+),\"'kI. \u2022 . .,\nwhere the l's and the ),'s descend with the same rapidity as the h's.\nThe convergency of the first part of this expression is unaffected by\nthe size of k. But the convergency of the portion outside the sign of\nintegration is destroyed if ),\"k, ),2'\"k2, &c., do not constitutea descending\nseries.\nAt this point a new division presents itself; between ({3) those\ncases where the data allow us to attain the degree of precision usually\nascribed to the Laplace-Poisson method; such that fractions (of the\nBought probability) which are of the order .:, or more correctly\nJ~' are retained; and (fl) where the reg;lation degree of pre-\ncision is not attainable.\na{3. To Sl\\tisfy the condition imported by {3, it is necessary that the\nseries )\", )'\"k, )''''k2, should descend as rapidly as I.' k\" kIN; therefore\nthat k should not exceed the order of unity. To satisfy this require-\nment, it is a necessary and sufficient condition that p (the excess of\nsuccesses over the number most probable on hypothesis of mere chance)\nshould not exceed the order Jp.2pq. That this is a sufficient condition\nmay thus be shown. i Put\nkI = (q (1\u00a3+1)-p) log. [1-q(:+I)]+(P(1\u00a3+I)+p) log.

The proposition is, however, independent\nof this condition. See my paper \"On the Law of Error,\" Phil. Mag., 1886,\npp. 313, 320.\nOp. cit..

Hencethe terms of the above written expansion above the second\nare of the order ..!..., and therefore may be rejected. And the value of i\npq\",\nthus presented is of the order unity. Again, while this limitation of\nthe size of p is sufficient, it is also necessary. For, differentiating It:\"\nwith regard to p, we observe that the first differential is continua.lly\n(from the zero of p and Ie upwards) positive. Hence Ie (taken\npositively) continually increases with the increase of p. Hence, if i\nis as large as is allowable when p is of the order ..,I2pq\"\" Ie will be too\nlarge when p is above that order. Hence the stated limitation of the\nsize of p is not only sufficient, but necessary.\nHere arises a new principle of division: aCcording as (oy) we do not\ninsist upon the full degree of precision which is attainable, but are\ncontent with an approximation which does not take account of terms\nof the order J.,;; or (Y) we seek the full degree of accuracy to which\nwe are entitled tan approximation true up to the order 1 ,rejecting\n1 ,Jpqp.\nonly terms of the order - .\npq\",\na{Jy. In the first case we may reject the second term of the above\nwritten expansion of Ie. For it is evidently of the order 1 . We\n..,IP9.11-\nmay reject also the unintegrated portion 1 of our result. For that\nportion is an expreBBion of the form rx', where 'A' is of the order ~\nIII \"'.\nAnd it may be shown that .for the values of r with which we are\nconcerned, the ratio of r to J\n'lrl ePde (the integrated portion of\nour result) is small in comparison with the order ,Jp:. For, as to\nvalues of r between 0 and I, the ratio in question ranges from 2'to V.\nAnd for values of r above unity, the integral may be written (by an\napproximation due to Laplace):-\nJ'Ir (; - ! + J:c. )-;-\nHence the ratio in question is of the order r, which by hypothesis is\nsmall with regard to ..,1-';. Hence, in every case (under a{Jy) the\nunintegrated portion of the result may be rejected. And we have\nthus the formula given in the former paper; which, as the last degree\nof accuracy is not required for the purpose in hand, the elimination of\nchance, may be regarded, I think, as the best formula for the case\nusually occurring in statistical inquiries, the normal case.\nI Above, p. 191.

There remain over the cases which do not possess any simple\nancillary form. As far as I know, these cases do not admit of a solution\ncomparable with the methods which have been described, in respect of\nconcinnity and elegance. There exists, however, a rougher procedure,\nwhich has the advantage of being most efficacious exactly when the\nconditions upon which the general method (0) depends are least\nperfectly fulfilled.\nThe series which we have to sum is\nN -(m+n) m+71\nNI (1-1\u00a3) x U\n[N-(m+71)]!

For, even\nif n were zero, the term in question would be only just equal to unity;\nand by the increase of n the numerator is continually diminished,\nwhile the denominator is increased. Call this fraction 'V. It is easy\nto see that the third term is less than 172, the fourth term less than vS,\nand 80 on. Accordingly, the expression within the brackets forms a\nconvergent series; which we can either sum by evaluating as many\nterms as we think fit, or by putting at once the expression without thp\n.

It is\nrequired to appreci&te by means of the calculus of probabilities the\nevidence in favour of BOme extraordinary agency which is afforded by\nexperiences of the following types: (1) One person chooses a suit of\ncards, or a letter of the alphabet. Another person makes a guess as to\nwhat the choice has been. This experiment--a choice by one party. a\nguess by another-is performed N times. The number of successful\nguesses exceeds the number which is the most probable on the suppo-\nsition of mere chance, viz., m, where m= Nu (in the above-mentioned\ncases respectively IN and -hN), by a considerable number no where\n,,=Nv. (2) There a.re given a second and a third similar series of\ntrials, in each of which the number of successes exceeds the number\nmost probable on the hypothesis of pure chance, viz., Nu' N\"u\", by\n,,' n\" respectively. Or (3) along with a number of such series there\noccur BOme in which the number of successes falls below the most\nprobable number. What probability in favour of the existence of some\nagency other than chance is afforded by (1) a single series, in which the\nsuccesses are in excess; (2) a set of series, in each of which the\nsuccesses are in excess; (3) a chequered set of series in some of which\nthe successes are in exceBB, in others in defect1\nThe answer to the first of these problems depends upon the answer\nto the following question: What is the probability that under a \".EgimIJ\nof pure chance-suppoaing that there were'no disturbing cause at work\n-the observed excess of successes would occur! Call this probability p.\nThen the measure of the sought probability-that some agency\nother than chance has operated-is 1 - p. 1 The first problem is\nthus made to depend upon a simple, or at least straightforward,\ncalculation. The second problem is made to depend upon the\nfirst--or rather the question upon which the first depends-in the\nfollowing manner. For each of the given series find the proba,-\nbility corresponding to the P which has been just defined. Call\nthe set of values thus found respectively PI' P-n &C. The evidence\nin favour of a cause other than chance which is afforded by the whole\nset of series, the complete concatenation of data, is 1 - PI XPs x eke.\nLastly, the third problem is thus resolvable into the second. &\narrange. without manipulation and cookery, but in a random fashion-\nthe given chequered set of series into a smaller set of larger series:\nsuch that each of the new series may present excess. An example of\n, See Note ',at the end of Part II, Gooole\nc5l'Qitlzed DY \"\n\fThe Oalculus of Probabilities. 199\nthis process is afforded. by the problem mentioned by Mr. Gurney.\nThere the data consisted of a set of ten series: each of them containing\na thousand trials, and one of them presenting defect of successes-\nfewer successes than upon the hypothesis of pure chance would be\nmoat likely. If we lump this defective series with QIf\/\/!J of the nine\nremaining, there will result a composite series of 2,000 trials which\npresents excess of success. Our data will then be eight series of 1,000\nand one series of 2,000 trials; each series presenting excess. The\ndata thuB modified exemplify our second problem.\nEverything then depends ultimately upon the calculation of pro-}\nbabilities such as the above-defined p. In the preceding paper I stated\nthe method of calculation which, as being required and proving\nsufficient for most, or at least many, statistical investigations analogous\nto those of PlI!Jchical ReseMCh, may perhaps be described as the general\nor normal method. In this paper there is attempted a more complete\nstatement of the possible cases, and the treatment appropriate to each.\nThe cases constituted by the variety of our data may be divided\naccording to the presence or absence of each of the following\nattributes :-\n(a) The numbers of trials N small enough to admit of direct\narithmetical computation.l\n(6) The quantity 2Nu(I-1\u00a3)II a small fraction.s\n. n\n(c) The quantity J2N1\u00a3(I-u> not greater than 2 [or 3].4\n(d) N not exceeding 1200 (or the highest number for which the\nvalue of log. r (N+1) is given in tables accessible to the operator).6\nThe presence of one of these attributes may be expressed by the\ncorresponding letter, e.g., 6; its absence by the same letter with\na negative sign superscribed, e.g., b. Thus the heading ahg refers to\nthe case in which N is \"a large number, the quantity 2u (1~ u) N is\na small fraction, and the quantity J n )N does not exceed 2.\n21\u00a3(1-1\u00a3\nAs to the presence or absence of the fourth attribute nothing is stated ;\nN may be either above or below the linrit 1200.

The order\nexactly resembles the devolution of real property according to English\nlaw. Our table corresponds with that given by Mr. Joshua Williams,\nin his lucid chapter on the descent of an estate in fee simple; if\nfor the trunk of our tree we put Mr. Benjamin Brown, the purchaser,\nfor a his elder, and for Ii his younger son.\nA complete logical tree which has four bifurcations ought to\npresent 16 ultimate divisions. But the task of examining so many\ncases is abridged by the observation that some of the branches are\nwithered nonentities, and others, though existent, are unfruitful, and\nwill not repay cultivation. Of the first sort is ad; also libe, which will\nbe found to involve a contradiction in terms, except in the very rare\ncase where the quantity 2u (1 - u) N approaches unity, where, though\nN is large, u is exceedingly small. That case falls into the second\ncategory of rejectible branches. For the distinction of lib into iibc\nand qjjc subserves no useful purpose, does not constitute a Natural\nKind. To the same category belong the (existent) sub-divisions of a.\nI proceed now, without further preface, to prescribe for and\nexemplify the particular cases.\nThis is the case of N small (say not exceeding 10).\nRule: Expand [u +(1 - U)]N by the binomial theorem; and add\ntogether the last N - (m+n) terms of the expansion, those written in\nthe second of the two following lines ;-\nN N-l\n(I-u) +N(I-u) u + &c.\n+ N (N-I) ....

Here,\nout of eight guesses, there are four successes; if success consist in\nguessing either the very letter thought of, or either of its neareat\nalphabetical neighbours, in short anyone of an assigned consecutive\ntriplet.

This term, in its unreduced form, is in our\nnotation\nJ2(N+l+N-(m+n\u00bb _'.0\n=-~~;:;:~~=\u00a3:::::;~<r::;=:::::;::=< x. ..-.\n3J.\".(N+l) (m+n-l) (N-(m+n)\nNow, if condition b is fulfilled, it is allowable to expand the non-\nexponential part of this expression in ascending powers of Nand\nneglect terms after the first. Remembering that m=Np (approximately\nat least, see above, p. ), we have for the first term of the expansion\n,j2 (l+q) -ki -lCI ~oI.\n-a J.\".Npq x e.

See Rule abc.\n4 The ground of the distinction between c and cis the fact that\nin many of the books the table of the integrated error-function does\nnot extend beyond the argument 2; in few or none beyond 3. The\ncircumstance that the tables have not been carried further is connected\nwith an important property attaching to cases where the observed ecart\nexceeds two or three times the modulus, i.e., to class ~: namely, that\nin these cases the evidence in favour of a cause other than chance has\nbeen regarded by the authorities as amounting to practical certainty.\nWhere, as in the Encyclopadia Britannica, editions 8 and 9, the table\nis continued as far as 3, then the latter limit should be taken for our\ndefinition. In this case Example 2 of abc and 1 of abC (pp. 202-3)\nfaU unequivoca.lly under abc. Employing the tables in Encyclopredia\nBritannica, edition 9, I find for the former example \u00b70015, and for\nthe latter (interpolating between the entries for 2\u00b71 and 2\u00b72) \u00b70012.\n~ The second term need only be added when there is some suspicion\nthat the condition b is not perfectly fulfilled; the case considered at\nthe end of note 8.\no It will be gathered from the theoretica.l analysis that it ia\npossible, with due caution, for one who knows the nature of the\nground, to advance a great way along the lines of the received method\nof approximation. Thus many cases of ab are amenable to the\nreceived general exponential formula; corrected not only by taking\nsome account of the term outside integration (as suggested in the rule\nfor abc) but also by taking account of the second term of the expansion\nof Ie (Poisson, Art. 78).
