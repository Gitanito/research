[March 28,\nIV.\nEXPERIMENTAL COMPARISON BETWEEN CHANCE AND\nTHOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE IN CORRESPONDENCE\nOF DIAGRAMS.\nBy LIEUT.-COLONEL G. LE M. TAYLOR.\nAs may be seen on reference to the Proceedings of the American\nSociety for Psychical Research, Vol. I., Part IV., Professor Minot has\ninduced 510 people each to draw for him 10 diagrams on a postal\ncard; he has thus obtained about 5,000 diagrams. These he has\ntabulated in various ways, and made the following deductions affecting\nthe inference drawn in England from certain experiments by diagrams\nin thought-transference made by our Society. Mr. Minot finds a great\ntendency among his respondents to draw certain particular diagrams,\nand also when these diagrams are drawn there is a tendency to draw\nthem early in a series. He thinks \"that the same visual images arise\nin many of us with approximately the same readiness,\" and that owing\nto this tendency during experiments such as those reported in the\nProceedings of the English S.P.R., \"thought-transference might be\nsimulated and a proof of its reality obtained which would seem over-\nwhelming so long as the law of relative frequency was disregarded as\nan explanation,\" and adds, \"Until this is done it appears premature\nto accept these experiments as valid proofs of thought-transference.\"\nAfter reading Mr. Minot's paper, it occurred to me to try to put his\ntheory to a practical test. With this object I prepared 40 sheets of\npaper by marking off on each side 25 square spaces headed, \"Please\ndraw 25 diagrams without receiving suggestions from any person, one\nin each of the spaces below, running down each column in succession,\nbeginning at the top of No. 1.\" I numbered the columns from left to\nright, a~d on each paper wrote, \"Begin on this side,\" and lastly before\nissue marked each paper, 1 A (agent), 1 P (percipient), 2 A, 2 P,\n&c., &c.\nThese forms I gave to my friends, who kindly did as requested, and\nI thus obtained 2,000 diagrams which may be imagined to represent\nthe result of 20 experiments in \"thought-transference\" of 50 trials\neach, but with the element of the transference of thought eliminated.\nOn comparing my \"Agent\" papers with the\" Percipient\" papers\nof the same number, I found only one absolute correspondence, namely,\na square which came second in each of the two papers marked No. 13.\nI found 10 cases in which there was such a correspondence in idea that\nDigitized by Goo~\n\fD\n~\n.\nDigitized by GoogIe\n\fOiaitized b ~Ie\n\f2..\n\"Il.tmX ~,1\/o~l>mC I\n)J~ I\nvr 13\nJI IJ\n( O(~ lr-\nDig ed b J C ~\n\fDigitized by Google\n\fJ\nD\n\fDigitized by Google\n\f1Il\no ~\n)-\n..... -- -\n- - ~\nDigitized by Google\n\f\fs\n.iF Potr\u00a5\"PwC\nA~ '\\ 0\n.\n~\u00bb\nAnt.\niZl~\nS~a{Jt.\nY'4\nJl\nDigitized by GoogIe .\n\f\f1890.] Experimental Comparison, &c. 399\nthey would, I think, have been considered more or less successes had\nthe experiments been real, and 9 in which, though the ideas were\ndifferent, if they had been badly expressed, they might have been mis-\ntaken for successes owing to a likeness in shape.\nThe accompanying lithographs are exact copies of the above-\nmentioned 20 pairs of diagrams, and give an idea of how far the cor-\nrespondence is carried. There are, besides, about 40 pairs having some\nfeatures in common, but which are not similar enough to be counted.\nThe rest of the diagrams which fall together in corresponding A's and\nP's are quite unlike. It must be remembered, when making these\n-comparisons, that though a larger number will fall together by chance\nthe more far-fetched the correspondences are made, the more will also\nfall together in a genuine experiment. I should feel bound in the\nlatter case not to count any correspondence as due to thought-\ntransference unless there was a marked likeness in the diagrams\n-concerned, and am consequently inclined to be guided by the same\nrule in considering the present series.\nAt most, then, without the aid of thought-transference, 20 successes\nwere obtained in 1,000 trials. How does this result compare with the\n~xperiments published in the ProceedingB of the S.P.R.1 Looking over\nthe diagrams figured in Vol. I., I find that in 42 attempts, of which\n31 are reproduced in the volume in question, there are 13 corre-\nspondences so near that, had they been found in my collection, I\nshould have noted them, namely-\nOf those beginning page 83, V01. I., Nos. 4, 6, and 9.\n\" \" \" 175, \" \" \" 1, 3, 4, 10, 11, 13, 16, 17,\n18, and 22.\nMr. Minot's \"law of relative frequency\" has had no very marked\ntendency to simulate thought-transference in my 20 experiments,\nand this under conditions singularly favourable for the development\nof such a law, seeing that all my respondents were people of the same\nclass, acquaintances, and living in the same neighbourhood.\nNow, passing to a consideration of the collection as 2,000 separate\ndiagrams, I have classed them much as Mr. Minot has his 5,000, but\nfound two difficulties in doing so. First, there is the difficulty, when the\ndiagram is complex, as many of mine are, of determining to which class\nit should belong. For example, I have the picture of a man in a boat\non a lake; should I call it a man, a boat, or a landscape 1 Second, the\nquestion arises how comprehensive a class may be made. Mr. Minot\nclasses horses, dogs, and cats separately, and all other animals together,\nbut I only have 5 cats against 8 rabbits, 8 butterflies, and no less\nthan 46 birds.\nTable I. shows that, though a tendency to draw certain diagrams\nDigitized by Google\n~.\n\fExperimental Comparison, &c. [March 28~\ndoes exist, those oftenest repeated in Mr. l\\finot's collection are not\nthe same as those which occur most frequently in mine. Geometrical\nfigures were preferred by Mr. Minot's respondents, while mine drew\ndiagrams representing men, animals, and flowers more often than any\nothers; both, however, show a partiality for words and letters of the\nalphabet.\nIf the classes were made to contain objects so nearly alike that, had\nany two of them fallen together as \"original\" and \"reproduction\" in\nan experiment in thought-transference, the trial would have been\nconsidered a success, the tendency in my collection to repetition would\nfall below that in Mr. Minot's. How far below it is difficult to,\nestimate without comparing :Mr. Minot's diagrams with mine, and\neven then the estimate would altogether depend on how near a corre-\nspondence the calculator considered necessary for a \"success.\" If we\nconsider only those diagrams in each collection the names of which fix\nboth the shape and the idea, leaving only the size undefined, such as\ncircles, squares, equilateral triangles, hearts, &c., and neglect those the\nshort names given to which do not define them, Mr. Minot's diagrams\nare repeated 90 times each on an average, mine only 5. If the whole\nof Mr. Minot's pictures which are repeated more than 4 times are\ntaken, the average of repetition is 33 for each, as compared with 14 in\nmy series. The pertinent question is, of course, not how many diagrams\nare repeated a few times, but how many times a few of the most fre-\nquently drawn diagrams are repeated.\nFrom Table II. it appears that the ideas conveyed by my diagrams\ndiffer from those conveyed by the American diagrams a good deal.\nowing, no doubt, chiefly to different surroundings. 1rIany of my\ndiagrams are complex rather than simple. I recognise in my series\nlittle evidence of a\" mental trick,\" though as I am conscious of having\nsuch myself. I have no doubt that this habit accounts for some of the\ndiagrams, as when the only 5 \"mouths\" pictured are drawn by three\nsisters. Some of my pictures owe their origin to what was easiest to\ndraw, or to what the artists thought they could do best. Many are\nsuggested by surrounding objects, and many are due to the mind\nrecurring to objects constantly encountered in the daily occupations of\nthe reproducer; but I do not think that anyone of these reasons should\nbe assigned 'as a cause for reproduction more than any other.\nTable III. corresponds with l\\Ir. Minot's Table VII., and shows the\naTerage place of the 10 most frequently repeated diagrams in the two\ncollections. I have not only given the average place of the diagram\n\"when it is drawn,\" but when it is omitted, taking it in the latter case\nas 51st. My 10 most frequently repeated diagrams, when drawn, show\nno tendency to come either early or late in the series. 1rlr. Minot's 10\nmost frequent come with me a little early. When every paper is\nDigitized by Google\n\f1890.] Experimental Comparison, &0. 401\nincluded, whether it contains the diagram concerned or not, my most\nfrequent 10 come late, and Mr. Minot's very late in my series.\nI do not find among my respondents any tendency to draw the\nmost frequently repeated diagrams early.\nIf, however, a striking tendency does exist to give preference to\ncertain diagrams and to draw these early in a series, but not to repeat\nthem when once drawn, the preferential ones will soon be run through\nin a number of trials of thought-transference, and then will follow\nfigures for which the reverse of a preference exists. If thought-trans-\nference were simulated by the tendency above mentioned, we should\nfind in a series, first, an abnormal number of successes, then the proper\nnumber due to chance, and towards the end remarkably few satisfac-\ntory results. But this does not appear to be the case.\nTABLE I.\nMr. Minot's Present\nSeries.
