Taxil (the pseudonym of the journalist and hoaxer Gabriel-Antoine Jogand-Pages, 1854-1907) founded the journal and folded into it several small Catholic anti-Republican and anti-Semitic journals.  He later went on to publish Le Diable au XIXe Siecle and Revue Mensuelle Religieuse, Politique, Scientifique in which he, along with Charles Hacks--with whom he published as \"Dr. Bataille\"--outlined the existence of Diana Vaughan and the secret Masonic cabal seeking to rule the world.   In January 1897, Pierre Abel Clarin Vivant (\"Abel Clarin de la Rive,\" 1855-1914), a Catholic, monarchist, anti-semite who had in his youth acted as an undercover spy for the French army in North Africa), took over the editorship and continued to run the journal until his death.  He had formerly contributed to similar journals, notably Franc-Maconnerie Demasquee, exploring Masonry as the \"fille de occultisme.\"  He focused the attention of this journal on the \"Jewish-Masonic conspiracy\" that, he believed, ruled France and sought the suppression of Christianity.  In June 1910, the journal changed its title to La France Chretienne Antimaconnique, and changed it again in 1911 to La France Antimaconnique.  In 1910, Rene Guenon began to contribute  to the journal, and in 1913 and 1914 he authored (usually as \"Sphinx\") a series of  important articles on Dante, the production of numbers, and the High Grades of Masonry, and other topics.  This collaboration is curious and has prompted much speculation because Guenon was himself an occultist, neo-Gnostic Bishop, and high-grade Mason (though an irregular one).  The journal is also important because it has the lengthy documentary collection of attacks on H.P. Blavatsky and the Theosophical Society: Swami Narad Mani, Chef de l'Observatoire secret europeen de la \"True Truth Samaj\" d'Adyar, \"Bapteme de Lumiere, Notes pour servir \u00e0 l'Histoire de la Societe dite Theosophique,\" October 1911-February 1912 (now re-published by Arche in Milan).  It also published Clarin de la Rive's fifteen-part compilation \"Francmaconnerie et Societes Secretes\" and \"Notice sur les diverses Societes Secretes americaines que ne sont officilellement rattaches \u00e0 la Maconnerie\" that ran from June 1912 to July 1914.  In both of these Guenon's hand (and that of his mentor F.Ch. Barlet) can be seen, though most of the information came from S.C. Gould's Miscellaneous Notes and Queries.    The journal also became involved in the internecine fights among Martinists, neo-Gnostics, irregular Masons, et al., over the the validity of the Swedenborgian Rite and the Rites of Memphis and Misraim, and over the expulsion of Guenon and others from the Ordre Martiniste and Papus's irregular Masonry in the spring of 1909.
