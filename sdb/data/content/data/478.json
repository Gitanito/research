[JAN., 1901.\nOF THE COUNCIL.\n. .\nA meeting of the *Council was held at the rooms of the Society, 19,\nBuckingham Sfte'et,' W.C., on December 14th. Mr. F. Podmore was\nvoted to the;ctair.' There were also present, the Hon. E. Feilding, Mr.\nJ. G. Piddington, Mr. Sydney C. Scott, Mr. H. Arthur Smith, and Dr.\nA. Wallace.\nTfi\u00a3 jflinutes of the previous meeting were read and signed as correct.\nTJt\/'Sydney Alrutz, of Upsala, Sweden, was elected an Honorary\n'.Associate for the coming year. ,\n'._'. Two new Members and ten new Associates were elected; and the\n. election of five new Associates of the American Branch was recorded.\nNames and addresses are given above.\nThe resignation of two Members and twelve Associates, who, from\nvarious causes, desired to withdraw from the Society at the end of the\nyear, was accepted. It was agreed to strike off the list the names of\ntwo Members and eighteen Associates, who had either removed or been\nlost sight of, or who had become only nominal members.\nThe names of the Members of Council who retire by rotation at the\nend of the year were read over. The Assistant-Secretary was desired\nto send out the necessary notices for the Annual Meeting of the Mem\nbers of the Society, to be held at the Westminster Town Hall, on\nFriday, January 25th, 1901, at 3 P.M.\nThe Council was informed that arrangements had been completed\nwith the newly constituted Westminster City Council for four General\nMeetings on the dates provisionally agreed to at the last Council meet\ning, namely :\u2014On Fridays, January 25th, 4 P.M., March 8th, 8.30 P.M.,\nApril 19th, 4 P.M., and May 17th, 8.30 P.M.\nSeveral other matters of business having been disposed of, the Council\nagreed that its next meeting should be at the Westminster Town Hall,\nat the close of the Annual Meeting of Members on January 25th, 1901.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nTHE 110th General Meeting of the Society was held at the West\nminster Town Hall, on Friday, December 14th, at 8.30 P.M.\u2014Dr.\nLLOYD TUCKEY in the chair.\nMRS. A. W. VERRALL read a paper on the trance phenomena of\nMrs. Thompson, a non-professional sensitive who has been for some\nyears under the observation of Mr. Myers and other members of the\nSociety. The paper dealt only with the observations made by the\nwriter during a series of sittings between April, 1899, and July, 1900.\n\fJAN., 1901.] General Meeting.\nAfter a general description of the way in which information is con\nveyed to the sitter\u2014in the presence of a third person, who acts as\nnote-taker\u2014by a supposed personality speaking through Mrs. Thompson,\nwho appears to be entranced, the paper went on to the classification\nand criticism of the statements made. Statements referring to the\npast or present, the truth of which was usually ascertainable, were\ndivided into three classes, according to results,\u2014things true, things\nfalse, and things unverified or unidentified. Under this latter head\nwere included not only statements that seemed to have no connection\nwith the sitter, but also such definite statements about friends of the\nsitter as had not, owing to lapse of time or other causes, been able to be\nverified. The total number of statements made to the sitter was 212 ;\nof these 49 were classed as unverified, 29 as false, and 134 as true.\nIllustrations were then given of the sorts of statements that were\nmade, with the object of showing that they were perfectly definite in\ncharacter and therefore easily classifiable. It was stated by the\nsensitive, for instance, that a small operation had been performed on\na friend of the sitter, consisting in the removal of a needle or crochet-\nhook by a red-faced little doctor (true) ; that a certain specified person\nhad one brother and two sisters living (partly true) ; and that a person\nof a given name and description was intimate in a specified house\n(false).\nThe 134 correct statements were then further divided into two\nclasses, according to the possibility of the information given having\nbeen \" normally acquired.\" Under the head of \" normally acquired \"\nknowledge was classified all such information given about a sitter at\na second interview, as is to be obtained from books of reference, as\nwell as any facts that could have been learnt from letters, etc., unless\nit was certain that the medium had had no possible access to them\neither in the normal or abnormal condition. Of the 134 correct state\nments, 47 referred to matters that might have been normally learnt,\nand 87 to such as could not. It therefore appeared that, after setting\naside unverified or vague remarks, incorrect assertions, and such correct\nstatements as were normally obtainable, there remained an irreducible\nminimum of 87 statements, out of a total of 212, or rather more than\n40 per cent., which were correct, and could not have been obtained by\nthe recognised means of information. This large percentage, taken in\nconjunction with the definite nature of many of the assertions, would\nseem to warrant the belief that Mrs. Thompson has some source of\ninformation not generally accessible.\nAt present the evidence was not sufficient to determine the nature\n\f4 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1901.\nof such a source of information ; possibly the source is not always the\nsame. The correct statements made were grouped under four general\nheads, and illustrative cases were quoted ; but the line of division\nbetween the various classes was not always strongly marked, and the\nclassification must be regarded as tentative.\nUnder the first head\u2014that of \" things known to the sitter and\ndirectly present in his consciousness \"\u2014fall all statements as to objects\nbrought by the sitter, and all characteristic descriptions of the sitter's\nfriends, when once there has been identification of the person described.\nFurther, under this head would come some instances\u2014not numerous,\nbut very clearly marked\u2014of apparent direct telepathy between the\nsitter and the communicating personality, shown by a direct response\nfrom the sensitive to an unexpressed thought in the sitter's mind.\nThe second class\u2014\" things known to the sitter, but not immediately\nat the moment present to his consciousness\"\u2014is a very large one,\ncontaining the greater part of the facts correctly given. Statements\nwere made about a dead friend of the sitter, which were accurate and.\ndefinite ; they were characteristic, but they were not present in the\nsitter's mind, nor what the sitter would have selected had she wished\nto recall memories of the friend in question to a third person. Details\nof dress and personal habits were described; but the more intimate\nand deeply-marked traits for which the sitter looked when the identi\nfication had been made were conspicuously wanting. Telepathy might\nhave been a contributing cause, but there seemed no reason to assign\nthe statements falling under the second head to direct telepathy from\nthe mind of the sitter.\nThe third class consist of \" things that have been well known to\nthe sitter, but are at the moment so far forgotten as to be recalled only\nby the statements of the sensitive.\" The distinction between this class\nand the preceding one was not always clearly marked, but cases were\ngiven where childish recollections of bygone events were evoked by\ndefinite observations of the sensitive that at first were hardly intelligible\nto the sitter.\nThe fourth class\u2014\"things unknown to the sitter\"\u2014though small,\nis very interesting, as telepathy cannot be assigned as the cause,\nunless a very much wider significance be given to the word than has\nhitherto been done. Communication with the mind of the sitter could\nnot explain the correctness of statements demonstrably unknown to the\nsitter's consciousness, as was the case with some of the statements, ten\nin all, falling into the fourth category. Details of some of these cases\nwere given, and it appeared that in a series of correct statements made\n\fJAN., 1901.j General Meeting.\nabout the relatives of a certain Mr. A., some of the facts were unknown\nto him, though known to other living persons who had never heard of\nMrs. Thompson at the time of the sitting, while two were unknown, so\nfar as can be ascertained, to any living persons, until a careful search,\nfollowing the lines indicated by the sensitive, had discovered them.\nAll the facts were familiar to the dead relative from whom the com\nmunicating personality claimed to derive them.\nTo sum up, it would seem that the information possessed by the\nsensitive is often possessed by the sitter, but not always. The know\nledge of the sitter would appear occasionally to pass readily to the\nsensitive ; but usually the statements made were not such as the sitter\nexpected, and a curious impression was often produced that the things\nwere regarded not from the sitter's, but from another point of view.\nWhere the knowledge shown was not possessed by the sitter, it was\ngenerally known to other living persons ; but that would necessarily be\nthe case with almost all verifiable statements. These living persons\nwere unknown to the sensitive, and had never heard of her. Much of\nthe knowledge shown had been possessed by the dead, and thus, in at\nleast some cases, unless we were to suppose that the sensitive was able,\nas it were, to look up facts in a spiritual encyclopaedia, we were left to\nchoose between the likelihood of telepathy from the mind of an unknown\nliving person to whom the thoughts of the sensitive had not been\ndirected, and communication from the dead. But before deciding in\nfavour of any theory so new as either of these, more evidence was\nrequired ; at present all that could be done was to collect and record\nthe facts, and wait for further developments.\nA paper by the REV. STANLEY L. KREBS, entitled \" A Description of\nsome Trick Methods used by Miss Bangs, of Chicago,\" was then read\nby MR. FRANK PODMORE. This paper is printed below.\nA DESCRIPTION OF SOME TRICK METHODS USED BY\nMISS BANGS, OF CHICAGO.\nBY THE REV. STANLEY L. KREBS, A.M.\nWith Introductory Note by DR. R. HODGSON.\n[MANY of our members will doubtless recollect that about fourteen\nyears ago there was a good deal of discussion in our Journal and\nProceedings concerning the value of human testimony as offered for\ncertain alleged supernormal physical phenomena, and especially for\nso-called independent slate-writing. The result of our investiga\n\f6 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1901.\ntions made at that time, with the assistance of Mr. S. J. Davey,\nled us to the conclusion that the bulk of this testimony must be\nregarded as worthless. The ordinary accounts of such phenomena,\nwhich are still frequent in Spiritualistic magazines, especially in\nAmerica, do not afford the slightest presumption in favour of the\nalleged medium's genuineness, and prove mainly that the persons\nwho give the accounts . are completely oblivious to what constitutes\nevidence in the matter.\nThere are, however, many not altogether unintelligent people\nwho fail to appreciate the full significance of this position, and\nwho are more impressed by a detailed description of how the trick\nis done, than by a proof that the record offered by some particular\nbeliever belongs to a class that is valueless.\nI think it may be well, therefore, not only to remind our members\noccasionally of the possibilities of trickery in general, and of the\nintrinsic inadequacy of the testimony commonly offered for the\n\"physical phenomena of Spiritualism,\" but to explain in detail the\nmodus operandi of any specially new devices or ingenious variations\nof old ones that come under our notice as actually practised by spurious\nmediums.\nThe \"Bangs Sisters,\" as they are commonly called in America\u2014\nMiss May Bangs and Miss Lizzie Bangs\u2014are still apparently flourishing\nin Chicago, Illinois, notwithstanding several exposures of their trickery.\nThe late Colonel Bundy gave accounts of these exposures in the Religio-\nPhilosophical Journal, and I had occasion to repeat some of the evidence\nof these in Light (May 13th and May 20th, 1899), but so far as I am\naware, no description has yet been published of their methods of pro\nducing fraudulent spirit letter-writing. The following account of these\nmethods is extracted from a report made to the American Branch of\nthe Society in October, 1900, by the Eev. Stanley L. Krebs, A.M., of\nReading, Pa., entitled \" Some of the Frauds of Spiritualism : A Plain\nStatement of Things Seen and Heard at seances during the years\n1898 to 1900.\" The report is written in a popular style and will\nprobably appear in full elsewhere. It contains references to some\nother mediums,\u2014P. L. 0. A. Keeler and the Campbell brothers, who\navoided giving Mr. Krebs sittings,\u2014and describes some tricks of the\nnotorious Slade. All that I quote here is Mr. Krebs' description\u2014\nslightly abridged\u2014-of a sitting with one of the Bangs Sisters, omit\nting his consideration of the handwritings of the alleged spirit-\ncommunications, and the confirmatory evidence furnished to him by\nother witnesses. E. HODGSON.]\n\fJAM., 1901.] Some Trick Methods used by Miss Bangs. 7\nMr. Krebs, after some introductory remarks, states that he was\nfurnished with the following letter of introduction from Mr. J. R.\nFrancis, editor of The Progressive Thinker :\n40 Loomis St., Chicago, June 3, 1899.\nMiss LIZZIE BANGS :\nDear Madam,\u2014The bearer of this, Rev. Stanley L. Krebs, is a\nprominent minister of Reading, Pa. I have called his attention to your\nexcellent mediumship. He is very sceptical, hence it will be well for you to\ngive him special attention. In so doing you will confer a great favour on\nme.\u2014Fraternally, J. R. FRANCIS.\nMr. Krebs secured an appointment for his visit, and writes :\u2014\nOctober 10th, 1900.\n... I appeared a few days subsequently at their handsome residence at the\nappointed hour, and for one hour and a half enjoyed the long coveted\nopportunity of witnessing for myself some of the phenomena I had heard\nand read so much about.\nThe Bangs sisters represent and produce nearly all phases of mediumship,\nslate-writing, spirit letter-writing, portrait-painting, materializations, trum\npet s6ances, etc., etc. I selected spirit letter-writing, and here is what\napparently happens according to the many accounts I had read and likewise\nheard from the lips of awe-struck witnesses.\nIn the privacy of your own home, on a blank sheet of ordinary letter\npaper, you write down three or four questions to as many deceased friends,\nor to one or two, just as you desire, addressing them by name and signing\nyour own name to the questions. Enclosing this in an envelope with three\nor four blank sheets for the \"spirit\" messages or replies, you seal your\nenvelope, and, if you wish, place some secret mark on it, to render\nidentification easier and surer, and at the same time to guard against fraud\nby the simple trick of substitution. Seated at an ordinary square table,\nwhich you are free to examine thoroughly, in the presence and indeed\nat the request of the medium, you place your letter between two slates,\nwhich the medium then binds about longitudinally and transversely with\nheavy, broad and powerful rubber bands, or strong twine. (See cut No. 1.)\nThese slates never leave your sight ; indeed, you may keep your fingers\nresting upon them during the entire time of the s6ance, so that touch\nreinforces sight in proving that the slates never leave the top of the table\nwhere you place them. . . . You and she, seated on opposite sides of the\ntable, then hold the slates between you, above the table, of course, in full\nsight, until the \" current,\" as she calls it, sets in, which you feel as a slight\nvibration or tremor in the slates and in your arms. The slates are again\nplaced on the table. You are then requested by the medium to write\nanother short message, such as, \" Please communicate,\" to any dead friend,\non a small piece of paper, sign your name to it and fold it up when written.\n. . . She turns her back while you write this note, to prove\u2014as she informs\n\f8 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1901.\nyou\u2014that there is no such thing on her part as reading what you write.\nThis note, when folded up, the medium requests you to hand her. She\nimmediately places it on top of the two bound slates, and lays another slate\nover it. (See cut 2.) You both sit quietly for awhile in silence, or else\nin easy conversation on any subject that happens to suggest itself. After a\nfew minutes the medium picks up one of several letter tablets lying about\non the table, and announces that she sees, \" clairvoyantly,\" in letters of\nfire, in the air over your head the name of some one. She gets the initials\nfirst, and finally the full name, and sure enough, it is the very name\nyou had just written a moment or two before on the small note. You feel\nastonished, and will you or nill you, awe-struck. These emotions are\naccentuated when, in fifteen or twenty minutes, she gives the name of\nanother \"spirit,\" which turns out to be one of those to whom you had\naddressed questions in the sealed envelope, now a prisoner between the two\nbound slates. She goes on to give the substance and even the very language\nof the question which you had put to the spirit, and these surprising\nproceedings continue until all the \"spirits\" are named, and all the questions\nin the sealed letter stated correctly by the medium sitting before you\nwith the slates still on the table where you had placed them.\nAfter sitting a few minutes more in silence, holding slates between you,\nthree raps on them or somewhere about the table constitute the signal that\nthe \" spirits \" or \" guide \" have finished their mystic labour ; whereupon the\nmedium hands you the pile of slates, which, please remember, has never, all\nthis time, left your hand or eye. You remove the upper slate, expecting to\nsee your note under it, but, lo ! it has vanished completely ! With concealed\nexcitement you unbind the remaining two slates, pick up your envelope,\nwhich you find all right within them, carefully examine it\u2014size, colour,\nshade, spots, specks, secret mark and all\u2014thus thoroughly identifying it as\nthe very one you had brought with you, and no mistake about that\u2014then\nyou open it, andfind the note, just as you hadfolded it, hidden away between\nthe sheets of letter paper, and to crown all, these sheets filled with writing in\nink \\ This, of itself, is a sufficient miracle, and you at first do not care much\nfor the sense or thought of the writing. You are simply overwhelmed with\nthe fact, patent, plain, and puissant, that chirography, enough to fill six or eight\npages of letter paper, has been executed in a sealed envelope between fast-bound\nslates under your very eyes and liands, and that a piece of paper placed above\nhas, somehow, in some way, by some means, passed through a solid slate (as\nthe medium indeed assure* you it has), and has appeared intact in a tightly\nsealed envelope bound between two slates. Finally, you examine the sense of\nthe communications and find it intelligent and A propos to the matters\ninquired about, and many people assert that frequently information is given,\nsuch as names of friends and incidents of the past, which is entirely unknown\nto the medium\u2014as far as they know at least\u2014and which could not, therefore,\nhave been furnished in the \"spirit-writing\" by her.\nI am here describing my first experiences, for I had two seances with the\nBangs sisters at an interval of one year. The reader who has never\n\fJAN., 1901.] Some Trick Methods used by Miss Bangs. 9\n.experienced a seance such as this, can scarcely form an adequate conception\nof the feelings of awe and wonder that steal across the inind. The remark\nable results, the silent surroundings, the comments of the medium, the\nentire ensemble\u2014these impress one at once and almost to the point of convic\ntion, aud I could easily mention the names of many highly educated and\ncultured people that have felt dazed and nonplussed, despite themselves,\naud notwithstanding the fortifications of their own doubts and previous\nsneers at the whole subject. During the decade or more that the Bangs\n\u00abisters have been holding seances, dozens and hundreds have gone there\n.convinced that the whole thing was a trick and a humbug, and determined\nto discover the secret, but have come away sadder if not wiser men, either\nfully convinced the other way, or, like Dr. F , confessing their utter\ninability to explain it, understand it, or remotely guess as to the nature of\nthe powers at play therein, whether celestial, human, or diabolical.\nNow let vis turn from what apparently happens and see what real!\/\/\nhappens.\nI went, on the occasion alluded to in Chicago, with great expectations, and\nindeed (to be strictly honest both with myself and my reader), in hopes,\nin fond hopes, that the claim of Spiritualism would be found to be true ;\nnevertheless, I also provided as far as possible against fraud, for all of us\nhave an innate horror of being duped, even if harmlessly so, but especially\nand particularly when we pay hard cash for the duping into the bargain !\nThinking, therefore, that the table might be used (as in a former case\nwhich I shall narrate later on), simply as a screen for operations of a\nfraudulent nature, I armed myself with a small, rectangular looking-glass,\nthree by four inches in size, and secreted it under the front part of my vest,\nso as to have it convenient for unobserved production, if needed, when seated\n.at the table. I came within an inch, literally, of precipitating a catastrophe\nand spoiling the whole experiment and losing my opportunity, for the glass\nalmost slipped from me several times while walking about the room prior to\nthe seance. When seated, the doubling of the body kept it snugly in place.\nAt the request of Miss Bangs I examined the table thoroughly and the\ncloth upon it. Both are sound. There are no mechanical tricks or devices\nabout them. I suggested sitting without the cloth, for it fell down five or\nmore inches all around the table and I feared it would obstruct my view in\nthe glass of the space beneath. To this proposition Miss Bangs positively\ndemurred, and it was this demurrer that aroused my suspicions on this\noccasion and determined me to be as open-eyed as possible ; and vet I tried\nto be as easy and unsuspecting as I could, so as not to arouse her suspicions\nof me or of my intentions.\nWhen we were both seated at the table I got my sealed and marked\nenvelope out of my coat pocket and handed it to her, at her request. She\nfelt it and said it was a fat letter, and asked how many sheets I had in it. I\ntold her six or eight. She said four was the usual number, but she would\ntry for results with the letter as it was. In my sight she then placed it\nbetween the two slates and bound them, as seen in cut No. 1.\n\f10 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1901.\nWhile she was doing this, with my eyes riveted upon her every movement,\nI slipped the mirror out from under my vest, and adjusted it in my lap,\nholding it between my legs at such an angle,\u2014moving it from time to time as\nneeded with my right hand,\u2014that I could clearly see everything under the\ntable, and beyond it to the door between the two rooms, and the medium's\nlap ; for, fortunately, the table cover, instead of completely hiding her lap,\ncame down to within an inch or two of it along the line of vision from the\nglass, while I held up my side of the cover with my left thumb, allowing the\nfingers of my left hand to lie at ease, in a natural position of rest, on the top\nat the edge of the table, in sight of the medium. I did this to remove any\nsuspicions she might form that anything crooked was going on at my side of\nthe table (see cut No. 3 for all these details). And in order to deepen this\nimpression and her sense of security, I at times placed the right hand also on\nthe table, held the slates with it, touched them, etc.\nAnd thus we sat, she watching me, and I watching her, and yet eacli\nbelieving the other to be innocent and unsuspecting !\nWhen the two bound slates were on the table (with my sealed envelope\nbetween them), she picked them up and asked me to hold them with her.\nSo we held them between us about a foot above the table. I soon felt a\nslight but distinct vibration or tremor, which is easily explained as thfr\nresult of muscular tension exerted by the medium, and is a very common\nphenomenon that any one can produce. But I thought I would ask the\nmedium and see what she might have to say about it. She said it was\n\" magnetism,\" \" spirit power,\" \" the current,\" for which she was waiting, and\nit constituted a sign, said she, that the \"spirits\" were present and that we\nwould have good results (!). This remark prepared me for more fraud.\nAnd I got it, by the wholesale. But I never expected, even then, to make\nthe full and complete discovery of the entire modus operandi of the compli\ncated trick, as I actually did.\nAfter this she picked up one of the several large letter tablets lying around\non her side of the table, and moving it over so as to cover about one half of the:\nbound slates (note this), and gazing mysteriously into the air, said she saw a\nletter S ; soon another letter, L, appeared to her, and then a third, K ;\nwhereupon she asked me whether they were the initials of any person I\nknew. \" Yes,\" I replied, \" they are. They are my own initials.\" \" Ah ! is\nthat so ?\" she exclaimed. \"But you knew my name,\" I ventured to assert,\n\" from the letter of introduction of Mr. Francis.\" \" No, I did not read it, a\u00bb\nit was addressed to my sister,\" was her answer. Now mark ; this whole\nmanoeuvre of the clairvoyant initials was simply a ruse to divert my atten\ntion from the movement of the letter tablet over the end of the slates, which\nto all appearances seemed a perfectly natural movement on her part as she\nleaned forward over the table and looked up into the air for the initials.\nWhat the purpose of the tablet in this position over her end of the slates\nwas we will discover in a moment.\nTo resume. After the initial incident, she removed the tablet, picked up\nthe slates, and we held them between us \" to develop power.\"\n\fFIG. 1. Kin. 2.\nFio. 4.\n\f12 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1901.\nAfter this, she requested me to prepare a note on a small piece of paper,\nwhich she handed me (size of half an envelope), and address it to some one\nin spirit-life. She said she would turn her back while I was writing it, so as\nto preclude any possibility of her seeing what I should write, or the name.\nWhen she had turned her back, and while I was engaged in writing the note\n(which I addressed to \" Mary Smith,\" asking her to \" please communicate\"),\nsuddenly a happy thought struck me. I quickly reached over, carefully\npicked up the two bound slates and rapidly and silently turning the ends\nlying towards her up before my eyes, almost caused those organs to leap out\nof their sockets with astonishment when they saw a small wedge sticking\nbetween the slates, thus prising them open mde enough to allow not too fat a\nletter to slide out through the space thus made between them ! ' (The situation\nat this exciting and critical moment of discovery is shown in cut No. 4.)\nUpon this discovery my excitement was great. It was a critical moment.\nShe might turn at any second. And knowing this much, I longed to dis\ncover the entire secret. So quickly and noiselessly I replaced the slates,\nfinished my note, told her I was through, folded the note three or four times\nat her request, and handed it to her.\nLet us look back now a moment, and see how this discovery explains\nthe purpose of the ruse of the clairvoyant initials', S.L.K. It was to get the\ntablet over the slates while the attention of the sitter is diverted to thought\non the initials and their meaning, and under cover of the tablet push the wedge\ninto place. It is an easy matter to slip the wedge between the slates, for it\nis made of such dimensions\u2014about the thickness of a lead-pencil and about\n2i or 3 inches long (see cut No. 5)\u2014that when lying on the table its point is\njust high enough to strike the crack or line of junction between the bound\nslates, and the latter, being bound with rubber bands, easily give place to it,\nand even if tied with twine can readily be prised apart, inasmuch as the\nknots would give a little and the fibres and twists in the twine would too, as\nthe force of the wedge is very great, according to well-known mechanical\nprinciples. Moreover the edges of the two slates at the line of junction\nwere not flush, because the frames of the slates were rounded on the outside.\nHence, when placed together, a re-entrant angle was formed, so that the\nwedge as it was pushed along under the letter tablet on the table could readily\nfind hold or point of application, i.e. strike the crack before mentioned, and\nthus readily prise apart the slates (see cut No. 5, which shows rounded ends\nof slate frames).\nTo proceed. Remember I had just finished my \" Mary Smith \" note and\nhanded it to her. She took it, and after putting a small blot of ink on it,\nwhich she said the \"spirits\" would use in producing the writing, with her\n1 In examining the slates with her permission before the seance began, I had noticed\nthe curious fact that the wooden frames were whittled or planed down on the sides\nwhich she was careful to turn inwards, the frame being thus made flush with the slate\nproper. We now see the purpose of this, namely, to avoid catching the letter on the\ncorner of the wooden frame, and thus to smooth the wny for it to slide out the more\nreadily and surely.\n\fJAN., 1901.] Some Trick Methods used by Miss Bangs. 13\nright hand she dropped or threw it, with assumed carelessness but really\nwith considerable dexterity, upon the centre of the upper of the two bound\nslates apparently (that is, a careless or excited observer would have thought\nit had dropped into the centre of the slate, but it actually fell on the wooden\nframe of the slate with about one-half inch of the note projecting beyond the\nframe, and instantly, yea, almost in one and the same moment or act, she\ncovered slates and note with a third slate that she had picked up with her\nleft hand, and which was larger than the lower two slates, and projected about\nune inch all round, thus effectually hiding the projecting half inch of the note.\nBut at this point I, eagerly wishing to see the whale process repeated in\norder to be doubly sure of my details, and wishing to get another chance\nto see the wedge and whether the letter was at this stage still between the\nslates or not, told her (which was true, too) that I had written the note\nin such a hurry that I was afraid neither the \"spirits\" nor I could read\nit. She said I certainly ought to write plainly, and \"moreover,\" she added,\n.' I do not think you held the note long enough to magnetize it.\"\nThereupon she lifted the top slate off, brushing the note off with it, which\nfell on the table beside the two bound slates, handed me another small\npiece of paper, and turned her back. Steadily and rapidly I raised and\nturned the slates, as before described, and this time not only saw but felt\nthe wedge, estimated its size and shape, and gazed into the space between\nthe slates. The letter was not there. All this took but a second or two.\nHow well I remember my suppressed excitement ! However, I calmly\nreplaced the slates, wrote the note to \" Mary Smith,\" folded it, and more\ncarefully, though with assumed indifference to her, watched her as she took\nit, placed ink blot on it as before, and then dropped it on frame of upper\nslate in such wise as to leave half an inch of it projecting outwardly,\nand simultaneously covered it with the large slate.\nBut before proceeding, let us see how the letter was removed. It was as\nfollows : At the end of the paragraph about the clairvoyant initials S.L.K.,\nI said, \" She then picked up the slates.\" Remember, at that point they\nalready had the wedge between them, which she had just pushed into place.\nShe moved the slates carelessly and naturally (talking all the while), towards\nher end or edge of the table, and there tilted them up a moment (a brief\nmoment, so brief it would not have attracted the attention, much less\naroused the suspicion, of the average or careless or believing sitter, especially\nwhen that sitter's attention was diverted to what she was saying in her\nvoluble talk), so that the letter could not help sliding down into her lap,\nall unobserved. And there is where the letter is lying at the stage of the\nproceedings to which we have arrived. I know it was there\u2014first from the\nnegative evidence that it was not between the two slates, and secondly from\nthe extremely positive evidence that \/ saic it in my little looking-glass under\nthe table.\nWe now proceed. First, recognize the situation : The sealed letter is in\nher lap and the note to \"Mary Smith \" projecting under the large upper or\nthird slate. Recourse is again had to the tablets. Pretending to see some\n\f14 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1901.\nmore initials in the air and to write them down on the tablet, she straightened\nherself up in her chair, and thus carelessly moved the tablet over the pile of\nthe three slates, and with the finger of her right hand under the tablet, she\nslips the projecting note out and holding it up against the under side of the\ntablet removes it to her lap as easy as you please, while she asks me to think\nwho the new initials stand for. And whilst I am trying to think (for they\nstand for nobody, being any letters that first enter her head), she deliberately\nunfolds the note in her lap, looks down and reads it. Then, apparently to\nsecure a more restful position in her chair, but really with a view to what is\nafterwards seen to be a critical movement in the cltain of processes, she turns\nhalf round to the right towards the door which in our preliminary conver\nsation she had told me connected the room with the house of her sister, half\nrises, spreads out her skirts, and resumes her seat, facing the door, however.\n<See cut 3).\nAt this point an unexpected digression occurred which came very near\nspoiling the whole affair. I was so eager to observe her every movement\nAt this stage of the game, so anxious to discover the remaining secret\u2014\nnamely, how the writing was done inside a sealed envelope, which would round\nout the whole trick and my discovery as well\u2014that I must have gazed too\npersistently and intently down into my lap-glass, for she suddenly exclaimed,\nlooking directly and searchingly at me, \" Have you a looking-glass in your\nlap?\" I had presence of mind enough to reply, \"Why, what makes you\nthink so ? Because I look down '!. The fact is 1 have studied hypnotism\n,a little, and having heard that mediums sometimes hypnotise their visitors,\nand desiring on this most interesting occasion to keep a clear head, and\nmake a fair and impartial investigation, I did not wish to expose myself\nto the power of your eyes, whether you can hypnotise or not.\" Whether\nthis idea satisfied her reason or tickled her vanity I do not know, but it\nhad the much-desired effect of allaying her suspicions and allowing the\nproceedings to go on.\nWe now pick up the thread of the narrative where the medium, with the\nsealed letter in her lap, and the \"Mary Smith\" note too, which she had\njust secured in the manner above described, had turned toward her sister's\ndoor. That sister, or some other accomplice, was just on the other side of that\ndoor waiting to do her part. The sealed letter and the note must be gotten\n.over to her, the letter opened, the questions answered as her ingenuity might\n.suggest, and as she was aided by overhearing any answers that the sitter\nanight make to the questions of the medium ; the letter must then be\nresealed and gotten back again to the medium and into the slates. How was\n.all this to be done ? Well, I tried to keep my eyes both above and below\n.the table, and on the medium's eyes too as often as she looked at me after what\nhadjust happened. What I succeeded in seeing was this. Miss Bangs picked\nup a tablet (as usual, a new act begins with a tablet), and saw the name\n-\" Mary \" in letters of fire in the air. \" Do you know a Mary in spirit-life ? \"\nwas asked. \" Yes.\" \" Does her last name begin with the letter S ? \" \"It\n-does.\" \" Let me see ; I'll try to get the whole last name. Is it Smuggle ?\u2014\n\fJAN., 19(11.] Some Trick Methods used by Miss Bangs. 15\nNo. Shrive ?\u2014No. Simmer ?^No. Oh, yes, I see it now ; it is Smith.\nDo you know any one in spirit-life by the name of Mary Smith?\" This,\nremember, is the name I had written on the note. Another sitter would\nhave been surprised at her knowledge of it, as I was the first time I had\na seance with Miss Bangs ; but as I was now familiar with the peregrina\ntions of that note I was not surprised a bit, though I pretended to be,\nin order to allay her suspicions. And now, notice, it was the moment while\nI was labouring under the crest of this wave of mimic surprise, which she,\nhowever, judged to be genuine, that she chose to deliberately stoop down,\nplace the sealed letter on something dark-coloured, and about half-a-foot wide\nor less on the floor, which was in a moment or two drawn backward, and\ndisappeared with the letter and note on it under the closed door.\nMy Miss Bangs then, i.e. the visible Miss Bangs, i.e. the Miss Bangs\non the hitherward side of the door, immediately began to see more\nclairvoyant letters and messages, such as that I wanted \" Mary \" \" to com\nmunicate.\" She then asked me a lot of questions about \"Mary,\" whether\nshe was my sister, aunt, cousin, how long dead, married or single, etc., etc.\nThis consumed eight or ten minutes of time. In the midst of it I heard a\nslight sliding sound, and instantly looked into my glass as Miss Bangs, as\nthough to change her position in her chair, stooped forward toward the door.\nI saw her pick up a small piece of paper from that before-mentioned dark-\ncoloured slide on the floor at the door, place it in her lap and read it ; where\nupon she immediately began to see more clairvoyant names in the air, a\nnumber of them, in fact, and, in short, mentioned all the names I had written\nin my sealed letter, giving them exactly, name for name, letter for letter, as\nwell as the substance of the questions I had asked of each one. She asked\nme a good many questions about \" Jack \" and about \" Mary S.\" and\n\" Youkers,\" evidently because the questions I had written to these \" spirits \"\nwere difficult to answer, and she wanted to elicit as much information as\npossible from me regarding them, in the hope that I would let fall some\nremark or hint that would enable her sister, who was listening at the door,\nto frame a passably suitable reply for the letters, all of which, of course, she\nwrote in the other room on the blank sheets provided for the \"spirit\" replies.\nAll this manoauvring consumed considerable time, time enough to do twice\nas much writing as was actually done.\nAt last I saw, through the glass, the letter thrust through beneath the\ndoor on the dark slide, and safely lodged in Miss Bangs' lap. Now, how is\nshe going to get it back between the slates 1 The thoughtful reader may easily\njudge in advance, namely, with the tablets, of course. Even so. She coolly\nplaced one tablet against her end of the lowest slate, which tablet was just\nas thick as the slate, so as to bring its upper surface even with the crack or\nopening between the two bound and wedged slates. Under another tablet\nshe held the letter fast by a finger or two, and after placing this second\ntablet over the other one, and partly, too, over the pile of slates, easily, with\na quick fillip of the finger reinforced by a lead pencil, which she deliberately\nused to push the letter in, slid the letter back into place between the slates,\n\f10 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1901-\nwithdrew the wedge between her fingers under the tablet, removed the-\ntablets, and all was done, in far leas time, too, than it takes to tell it.\nAfter the wedge is withdrawn, we hold the slates between us as we-\ndid at the outset, and in a moment or two three faint raps are heard\u2014\neasily made by the finger nails on the hard slate\u2014which she announces\nas the \"spirit\" signal that the messages are written and all is over, \"the\nspirits have done their work.\" I took off the upper slate. The note was,\nof course, gone. I untied the other two slates, and found the letter there\nwith the note inside it and messages in reply to the questions I had asked.\nDoes any one wonder how Miss Bangs No. 2 opened the sealed letter\nwithout tearing the paper or otherwise marking or disfiguring the envelope '!\nThis is a very simple matter, as I have since ascertained by repeated\nexperiment. Just wet the sealed envelope along the lap or line of mucilage,\nand let it stand three or four minutes, when it will open almost of itself.\nTake off the water with a blotter, or iron over the blotter with a hot\niron, which dries the lap sufficiently to permit resealing. The fold will\nbring it down with accuracy upon the place it occupied before, and thus\nany crosses or other marks put on it will fall exactly into their places.\nOr the letter can be opened by steaming the lap.\nIn conclusion, this is the whole of the trick, this the secret of the fraud,\nEt consists of various stages of development, carefully thought out, naturally\nconnected, cleverly executed. The tablets form one of the most essential\nfeatures, the wedge another, the crack under the door a third, and all else\nis grouped around these.\nOn this particular occasion, after the whole was over, I arose and\nthanked Miss Bangs for the most interesting exhibition she had given\nme, whereupon she kindly offered still more, namely, to take me into her\nsister's house and show me the \" spirit portraits \" there. This was precisely\nthe one thing I still desired, the only thing remaining to complete the\ndiscovery thus far made, for I wanted to get near the door, which was\non her side of the table, in order to see how the letter and notes were passed\nthrough it. At her offer, therefore, I instantly stepped over near the\ndoor, engaging her in conversation about some trivial matter on the wall\nin order to prevent her opening it at once, and there I saw that the door\nwas uneven, fitting close to the carpet at the hinge side, but being fully\na half inch or more away from the floor at the knob side, just in front of\nwhich Miss Bangs sat during the entire seance, thus making a crack wide\nenough to pass even larger packets to and fro than a letter and a note.\nThis opening is hidden from the eyes of the sitter at the table by an\ninnocent-looking waste-paper basket, which is shown in cut No. 3.\nAs Miss Bangs opened the door I caught a glimpse of her sister, a woman\nolder and larger than herself, who at that particular moment, with a look of\nsurprise and annoyance on her face, was flying out of the opposite door into\nthe hall way, where she disappeared up the stairs, evidently not relishing a\nmeeting with Dr. Francis' friend at that particular moment.\n\fFREDERIC W.

In the Arena\nfor December, 1900, Professor J. H. Hyslop of Columbia University,\nNew York, briefly reviews the work that has been done in the last\neighteen years by the Society for Psychical Research, both in England\nand in America, and appeals to the public for an adequate endowment\nto provide a complete organisation for the continuance of that work, and\nto place it on a more scientific and permanent basis. The investigations\nalready carried out, in particular in the Piper case, show, in his view,\nthat the phenomena represented in apparitions, mediumship, and\nsecondary personality\u2014this latter including certain forms of insanity\u2014\nare fit subjects for scientific study. Such study requires the mainten\nance of a permanent staff and of a psychopathic hospital, and for these\npurposes a large endowment is required.\nProfessor Hyslop urges that the time has come when the study of\nthese subjects should be systematically pursued by experts, and declares\nit to be a scandal of the scientific world that a field which promises the\nbest results for humanity, whether spiritism be ultimately accepted\nor refuted, is unable to receive due attention, while expeditions to the\nNorth Pole and deep-sea dredgings can obtain their millions with no\napparent difficulty. He makes suggestions as to ways in which the\nendowment might be made, and invites communications from all dis\nposed to contribute to such an endowment if adequate provision against\nmisuse were guaranteed.\nEven if Professor Hyslop's appeal is not successful in obtaining the\nmaterial support for which he asks, it cannot but do service in drawing\nattention to the claims of the subject to scientific recognition, and to\nthe drawbacks and even dangers likely to arise if the existing condi\ntions of investigation are indefinitely prolonged.\n\f20 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [FEB., 1901.\nA MUSICAL PRODIGY.\nTHE last number of the Annales des Sciences Psychiques for 1900\ncontains an interesting paper by Professor Richet on a case of musical\nprecocity. The paper was read by him at Paris during the Inter\nnational Congress of Psychology, where it was followed by a perform-\n'ance on the part of the child whose powers are described. The boy\nin question is Spanish ; his name is Pepito Rodriguez Arriola, and at\nthe date of the Congress he was three years and eight months old,\nhaving been born on December 14th, 1896.\nThere seems to have been musical talent in his mother's family.\nHis mother plays the piano well ; but it is difficult to find a parallel,\neven among the doubtfully authentic tales of early manifestations by\nmusicians of their special faculties, for the extraordinary performances\nof Pepito. The account of his earliest efforts comes from his mother,\nwho relates how, at the age of two and a half years, without any\nsuggestion from her, he one day when alone played on the piano a\nmusical composition which she had recently practised frequently.\nFrom this time onwards he made rapid progress, and at the age of\nthree years and twelve days performed in Madrid before the King of\nSpain and the Queen Regent.\nAccording to Professor Richet, the child presents no special charac\nteristics as regards physical, mental, and moral development; it is\nsolely as a musician that his precocity is manifest. His accomplish\nments are described by M. Richet under the three heads of execution,\ninvention, and memory.\nHis fingering is childish and eccentric, but very ingenious, and he\nsubstitutes for the octave, which his hands are too small to strike, a\nrapidly-executed arpeggio. His execution is irregular ; occasionally he\nloses his way, but suddenly, \" as if inspired,\" plays with precision\nand facility difficult passages. But it is the expression which he puts\ninto his playing which is the most remarkable point in Professor\nRichet's view ; in this he far surpasses his mother, whose teaching\u2014\nif her half-hearted efforts to control his studies can be so described\u2014is\nthe only instruction ever received by him. One most curious point\nmay be noticed\u2014his extreme unwillingness and apparent inability to\nplay on any piano but his own. This piano, according to Professor\nRichet, differs from other pianos only in being exceedingly bad ; and\nthere seems no discoverable reason, except perhaps some association of\nideas, why be should play well only on his own instrument.\nHis musical memory is very considerable ; he plays by heart\n\fFEB., 1901.] A Musical Prodigy. 21\ncorrectly some twenty pieces, and it should be remembered that he has\nnever been made to practise, or taught, in the ordinary sense of the\nword. If thirty bars are played through to him two or three times,\nhe sits down and plays them over, admits no corrections, and never\nforgets what he has once played. He can also pick out on the\npiano tunes that he has heard sung, and to these he finds the proper\nharmonies for himself.\nIt is not always easy to distinguish in a so-called improvisation on\nthe piano between memory and invention ; but Pepito, when impro\nvising, seems never to be at a loss, and often produces interesting\nmelodies, which are certainly not recognised by his hearers, and appear\nto be original. Here, again, as in his execution, the performance is\nirregular; in the midst of a tangle of false notes and hesitating\nconfusion will come clever combinations of rhythm or transitions from\none theme to another, as though the passages were dictated to him by\na real composer.\nProfessor Richet offers no explanation of these facts ; he is content\nto record them and to await with interest the future development of\nPepito's musical talent. The case presents some analogy with that of\nthe arithmetical prodigies\u2014the \" calculating boys \" whose performances\nhave been often recorded. (See account of the principal ones in Mr.\nMyers's paper on \"The Subliminal Consciousness: The Mechanism of\nGenius\" in the Proceedings S.P.R. Vol. viii., pp. 333\u2014361.) Or\na closer parallel may be found in the case of Mr. R. C. Rowe, a\nFellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. This gentleman, who died\nin 1884, was an extraordinarily brilliant musician, whose powers of\nexecution and interpretation can never be forgotten by those who\nheard him play. He showed his musical talent at a very early age,\nplaying from notes without instruction from the time he was four\nyears old. Unlike Pepito, his musical precocity seems to have been\nshown in his power of reading music. He used to relate how, as\na small child, before he could read books or knew anything of music,\nhe would spend happy hours poring over musical scores, not attempt\ning to play the music, which would have been beyond his compass,\nbut getting some real but unanalysable enjoyment out of the printed\nscore. At a later age he would place a book on the piano and read\naloud from it, while improvising at the same time ; and at school he\noften learnt his lessons in this way. His musical gifts, at least in\ntheir early development, do not seem to have been of quite the same\nnature as Pepito's ; whereas Mr. Rowe showed what his friends describe\nas an \" intuitive \" power of reading music, it would be difficult to find\n\f22 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Dream.\nThe following case of an apparently premonitory dream, the details\nof which were noted with great care immediately after its apparent\nfulfilment, was sent to us by Professor W. Romaine Newbold, of the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania. It seems to be conclusively proved that\nthe dream really occurred and preceded the event,\u2014that it cannot\nbe attributed to a subsequent illusion of memory. It is more difficult\nto judge whether the correspondences between the dream and the\nevent should be attributed to an actual supernormal prevision of\nthe latter, or to chance coincidence. It is not perhaps very uncommon\nto dream of being pursued by an animal; but in this case the im\npression produced on the boy's family seems to show that the dream\nwas at least more vivid than his usual ones, and the amount of detail\nin the correspondences of course lessens the probability that they were\nmerely accidental.\nThe account was given in a letter addressed to Mr. Myers as follows :\u2014\nSedgwick, Maine, August 29th, 1900.\nThis morning my wife and I reached this out-of-the-way nook, some forty\nmiles by water, though I believe but twenty by land, from Bar Harbor, and\na few hours after our arrival I got the details of a coincidence which I wish\nto record and send you at once.\nMy wife's parents, Rev. and Mrs. Geo. T. Packard, and, her brother\nKent, aged 13J, have been spending the summer here. Kent met us on the\nwharf, and on the way up told me something about being \"chased by a\nwhite horse,\" but I paid little attention to him. After dinner, while his.\nmother and sister and I were talking over the happenings of the summer,\nKent came into the room and said to his mother something\u2014I did not catch\nthe exact words\u2014as to the dream he liad some time ago about being chased\nby a white horse. Great excitement ensued, all began to talk at once. I\nscented something of value for the S.P.R., and succeeded in quieting the\nconfusion. Then I made them tell their stories in due order and took them\ndown in writing. From the notes which I then made I have written out the\nfollowing account. It has been verified by the witnesses.\n(1) Mrs. Packard's recollections. (Kent heard her tell this, but was not\nallowed to comment on it). At home in Boston, not long before they came\ndown here, Kent one night had a severe nightmare. He began to scream,\nthrash about in the bed and strike wildly in all directions. Mrs. P. tried to\n\fFEB., 1901.] Gases. 23\nsoothe him and finally got him awake. He said he had dreamed that a white\nhorse was chasing him around a wharf. He was so excited that he slept but\nlittle more that night, waking and crying out at intervals. Mr. Packard\nwas wakened by the noise of the first attack, and Mrs. P. remembers going\nin and explaining to him the cause. She remembers no further details of\nthe dream.\n(2) Ethel Packard Newbold remembers that she was told about the dream\nnext morning, and that Kent at breakfast kept saying, \"Oh that white\nhorse \" ; with expressive gestures of horror. (N.B.\u2014This would fix the\ndate as falling between May 28th, when E. P. N. went to Boston, and June\n16th, when I went there. I heard nothing of this. The family left Boston\nJune 25th.)\n(3) Kent is at first sure he had the dream after he came to Sedgwick, and\nthat \"Ethel only imagines she remembers it.\" After some reflection he\nconcludes that it was in Boston he had it. He dreamed that he was on a\nwharf, walking along. Some people, among them his mother, had just got\nout of a row-boat, upon the wharf. He had just passed them,\u2014heard cries\nand \" yells \" of \" Look out,\" heard footsteps, but they were not heavy\u2014very\nlight indeed for a horse. Glanced over his shoulder and saw a white horse,\nmouth open, long jaw, about to bite him,\u2014then he sprang into the water\nand\u2014woke to find his mother shaking him.\n(4) What happened. Kent's account. He had just come out of the\nbaggage room on the wharf at Sedgwick and was walking along the end of\nthe wharf. A row-boat came up and the people got out, as happened in the\ndream, but his mother was not among them. He passed them, heard the\ncries, the footsteps, looked back and saw the white horse, the open mouth,\nthe long jaw and face, the ears pressed back ; he jumped, not into the water,\nbut into a gangway about ten feet wide, which ran from the level of the pier\nto high water-mark. About two hours afterwards he recalled the dream\nand was much startled when he recognized the coincidence.\n(5) Mr. Packard remembers being awakened by the nightmare, and is sure\nit was in Boston, but did not at first remember anything about the content\nof the dream. Upon reflection he has a dim memory of the horse incident.\nKent laid stress upon the points that both in the dream and in fact the\npeople who got out of the row-boat were among those that called to him,\nthat the footsteps were light, not heavy, as one would suppose those of a horse\nwould be, and that the horse's jaw and head seemed so long. These items\nare of course of no evidential value, but the main facts.\u2014of being chased on\na wharf by a white horse,\u2014are, I think, pretty well established.\nI have read this over to the witnesses, and it has been approved by them\nall with the changes indicated [in the original MS. and here incorporated].\nKent says he cannot be sure the wharf of his dream was the same wharf he\nwas on this morning. It was \" just a wharf, and all wharves are pretty\nmuch alike.\" And he did not notice in the dream that the white horse was\nattached to a buggy. It might have been, but he did not observe whether\nit was or not.\n\f24 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [FEB., 1901.\nNovember 13th, 1900. On the afternoon of the same day on which the\nabove was written I saw a young man named Dority, who had been on the\nwharf that morning. After chatting with him awhile, I asked him whether\nhe had seen Kent's narrow escape that morning. He looked somewhat blank\nand said, \"What narrow escape?\" \"I heard,\" I said, \"that he was chased\nby a white horse.\" \"Oh yes,\" said he, \"yes, I saw that. That's a very\nvicious horse of Collier's ; they shouldn't allow him on the wharf.\" I found\nhe had seen the horse chase Kent and saw Kent jump into the depressed\ngangway. A week later I saw young Dority's father, who drives the stage\nfrom Sedgwick to Blue Hill. He gave the same account. I said nothing\nto either of the Doritys about the dream.\nI regard it as conclusively proved (1) that Kent really was chased by a\nwhite horse on the wharf at Sedgwick, Maine, on August 29th, and (2) that\nhe dreamed prior to June 25th of being chased by a white horse on a wharf.\nThis coiucidence is either due to chance or to supernormal faculty. Kent's\nexperience of wharves is limited. In his fourth, fifth, and sixth years he\nspent the summer at Castiue, Me., where there is a wharf like that at\nSedgwick. In the summer of 1899 he spent two weeks at Harpswell, Me.\nI do not know whether there is a similar wharf there or not. His other\nsummers have been spent inland. The other identifying circumstance which\nhe remembers\u2014the people disembarking from a row-boat, the light foot\nsteps, the long jaw and head, the jump\u2014are attested by his evidence only.\nHis apparent ability to discriminate the two memories, and his recognition\nof discrepancies between them, inclines me to place more confidence in\nhis recollection than I usually would give such evidence, and to regard the\ncoincidences between the dream and the fact as too numerous to be explained\nby chance.\nA word or two about Kent himself may not be out of place. He is tall\nand strong for his age, and very fond of all boyish sports. But he has\nalways been a precocious child. His mind is as active as his body. He\nhas a vivid fancy, dreams much and often has nightmares, though never\nbefore one as bad as this. He is singularly truthful. I have never known\nhim to lie, even in self-defence. I have known him to invent preposterous\nyarns in order to mystify his auditors, but in such cases he always, after\nenjoying their astonishment for a minute or two, makes a clean breast of it.\nIn this case the evidence of others, as well as his own obvious excitement,\nmakes it impossible to suppose that the whole thing was got up for purposes\nof mystification.\nW. ROMAINE NEWBOLD, Univ. of Pa.\nP. 267. Dream.\nIn the following case, again, as in that just given, it is impossible\nto say that the amount of correspondence between the dream and the\nevents that appeared to fulfil it is clearly beyond what chance could\n\fFEB., 19(11.] Ccises. 25\nhave produced. Still, the correspondence is striking and well attested.\nThe element of prevision is slight ;\u2014relating only, in fact, to a single\nstroke in the game ; the rest of the dream may be regarded as- a\nclairvoyant impression of an already existing state of things, namely,\nsome of the features of the ground and the appearance of one of the\nplayers.\nThe account was sent to Mr. Myers by Mr. Andrew Lang in a letter\ndated October 13th, 1900. The dreamer, Mr. Guy Ellis, dictated the\naccount to Mr. Lang, and afterwards signed it. Mr. Lang informs us\nthat other members of Mr. Ellis's family remember the incident. The\naccount, as dictated, is as follows :\u2014\nOctober 8th, 1900.\nIn March, 1894, I went to play in a foursome tournament at Silloth,\nwhere I had never been before. My partner was Mr. F. T. Ridley, of the\nAlnmouth Golf Club. We arrived at the hotel in the dark, and did not see\nthe links. We shared a double-bedded room. I had a dream more distinct\nand vivid than any other in my life. I woke Mr. Ridley and told him what\nI had dreamed. We had survived into the final round of the tournament,\nand one of our opponents on the tee was a remarkable-looking man,\npreviously unknown to me. A big black beard was especially notable.\nIn the course of the match, soon after the turn (at the 9th hole) I dreamed\nthat it was my honour, and I made a bad tee shot and sliced into a\nhorseshoe-shaped sand bunker, situated 011 the side of a rise in the\nground. My partner, as I gathered from his expression, thought it did not\nmatter much, as we were leading by a lot of holes, and would hardly lose.\nThat day we practised over the course, but did not see the horseshoe-\nshaped bunker. The competition went on, taking two or three days, and\nwe survived into the final. One of our opponents on the tee was the\nvery big man with the large black beard, whom I readily recognised from\nmy dream, as did my partner to whom I had told it. He said to me, \" By\nJove, that's the man with the beard, in your dream.\" We played our\nmatch, our opponents were very weak, and we were 6 or 7 up at the turn.\nAbout the eleventh or twelfth hole, I made a very bad tee shot, which went\noff the course into a horseshoe-shaped sand-bunker. My partner was going\nto play the shot, when he said, \" Your dream is true, for here is the bunker,\nand it does not matter whether we win or lose the hole.\"\n(Signed) H. G. B. ELLIS.\nMr. Ellis says that the bearded man was a Dane, who lived at or near\nCarlisle, and did not stay at the Silloth Hotel where he was. A. L.\nMr. Lang afterwards obtained for us the following letter of cor-\nroboration from Mr. Ellis's partner in the game, Mr. F. Ridley. The\nletter was addressed to Mr. Ellis.\n\f26 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [FEB., 1901.\n40, Salter's Road, Gosforth, Newcastle-on-Tyne,\nOctober IQth, 1900.\n... As regards the' golfing dream : We were at Ryton one Friday\nwhen you saw the advertisement about the competition at Silloth, also that\nFriday was the last day for entries. You wired our entry, and we went\nto Alnmouth that evening, collected our things and came back to N\/C.\nnext morning, lunched at a restaurant in Grainger Street, then set off\nfor Silloth, which we reached in the evening when it was quite dark.\nWe drove straight to a hotel, procured a double-bedded room, had a\nwhisky and soda, and went straight to bed. In the morning (Sunday)\nthe first thing I remembered was hearing you shouting, \" Are you awake ? \"\nand then saying you had had a dream about the forthcoming competition.\nI asked what it was, and you said that we were in the final. I said, \" That\nwas all right. Were we winning ? \" You said you did not know ; you\nthought we must be, as we did not seem to care, although we got into a\nround pot bunker to the left of a high hill and hacked and hacked away, but\nnever got out of it. You said one of our opponents was a big man, with a\nbig head and a black beard, something like W. G. Grace, the cricketer. (I\nremember we went out and had a smack or two with clubs, much to the\nannoyance of the people). During the preliminary heats of the contest we\nnever came across this pot bunker. It was, as you know, in the final, after,\nto my surprise, the man of your dream, black-bearded, big, and unusually like\nW. G. Grace, had announced himself as our opponent, that 7 put you into it.\n(You have it the other way.) I remember it was on the homeward journey\nthat I drove to this hole 011 the top of a hill. I got a slice on the ball, and\ngot into this up till then invisible bunker. We could not get out, so lost the\nhole, but were then so many up that we won easily. I have only been to-\nSilloth on that occasion. I was sceptical about you, I remember. I thought\nyou had been there before and knew the big, black man (Brandstaetter was\nhis name, by the by), but of course I found you had not.\u2014Ever yours,\nFRED. RIDLEY.\nP. 268. Dream.\nThe two cases we next give are uncorroborated, but interesting as\ncoming from Mr. J. G. Keulemans, of 12, York Terrace, Southend, a\nwell-known scientific draughtsman and Honorary Associate of the\nSociety, whose name will be familiar to many of our readers. Some\nexperiences of his were recorded in Phantasms of the Living (see vol. i.\npp. 196, 235, 255, and 444). Two of these, like those given below, relate\nto very trivial incidents\u2014one being an impression that a Dutchman\nwho was coming to see him that evening would ask him the meaning\nof the English phrase, \" to wit\"; which duly occurred the same evening.\nThe other was a mind's-eye vision of a little wicker basket, containing\nfive eggs with certain characteristics, which he specially noticed ; two\n\fFEB., 1901.] Cases. 27\nhours later he found that his mother-in-law had sent a similar basket,\ncontaining five eggs like those of his vision, to the house that morning.\n(See also an interesting account of various experiences of his recorded\nin Mr. Myers's paper on \" The Subliminal Consciousness : Sensory\nAutomatism and Induced Hallucinations,\" in Proceedings S.P.R. vol. viii.\npp. 516\u2014521). Several of these cases, like the golfing dream given above,\nsuggest a sort of sporadic clairvoyance of casual details in the percipient's\nsurroundings. The account following is dated October 18th, 1898 :\u2014\nNo. 62, Rue Chapral is a private boarding-house, but the tenants and land\nlord are friends of mine. I always stay with them, but had not been at that\naddress before, my friends having recently moved there. I arrived late\u2014\ntook a cab, and found the house just about 12 at night. I had, whilst\ntravelling, lost a shirt button, and my collar came undone, and, the weather\nbeing warm, this much interfered with my comfort. Hence I had been\nthinking to pick up a pin somewhere.\nI went to sleep (without having found one), when just as I was dozing\ninto sweet slumber, there stood within reach of my right hand on a table a\nblack lacquer-work tray with big pins, about 30, scattered about, and iu\nthe lower right corner was a very big needle, about three inches long, and\nshining like new.\nI never shall forget what a pleasant find that was, with that collar still\nbothering me (of course I was already dreaming at that moment). I put out\nmy hand\u2014to knock it against the wall\u2014which woke me up. There surely was\nno tray there, and I had quite as surely been dreaming, owing, as I thought,\n[to] the want of a pin previously experienced.\nNext morning we had breakfast in the garden. In the corner, under a\ncreeper, stood a table with some lady's work on it and a tray with the pins\nand the one big needle, just as I had seen it, exactly so in every respect. I had\nnot asked for a pin, but one of the inmates who had waited for me noticed\nmy bother with that collar. . . . And this young man may have known\nthat the tray with the pins and needle was there.\nCase 2.\u2014About a year ago I heard in my dream the postman's knock, and\na post-card came before my vision, written in German (I found the hand\nwriting was new to me) about business matters. I noticed several names of\nbirds, two of which had been erased, and the Latin instead of the German\nname substituted. This was near the finish, about an inch below the lower\nmargin. One of the names was of a bird, \" Zosterops.\" Then I awoke.\nIt must have been about six in the morning, just getting daylight.\nBy 8.5 a.m. the card was delivered. The word Zosterops was on it, so\nwere the two erased names, exactly situated as I had dreamt. The writer was\nnot known to me personally, but I knew him by reputation. I had never been\nprepared by any person either iu England, France, or Germany to expect any\ncommunication from that gentleman (Dr. Blatius), and although I knew the\nname well, I did not know that the writer was an editor of a book on birds.\n\f28 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [FEB., 1901.\nWhen I read the post-card it did, of course, strike me as very remarkable\nto see my dream realised in some of the minor details. However, I had no\nrecollection of having, in my dream become acquainted with the writing of\nthe matter it contained, but of the name Zosterops I was certain, also of the\ntwo erased words.\nJ. G. KEULEMAXS.\nP. 269. Dream.\nThe following account comes from Miss Agnes E. Walker, of 13,\nStafford Mansions, Albert Bridge Road, London, S.W. Both Miss\nWalker and the brother (Mr. Bernard Walker), who was the subject\nof her dream, are known to Mr. J. G. Piddington, to whom the letters\nrelating to the dream were addressed. It must be observed once more\nthat the exact verification of the dream might perhaps be regarded as a\nmerely accidental coincidence, since the chances against it were not very\ngreat. On the other hand, the evidence for the coincidence\u2014whether\naccidental or not\u2014-is strong, since six members of Miss Walker's\nfamily corroborate her statement that she had told them the date in\nthe dream before the latter was fulfilled.\nThough dreams of this kind\u2014supposing them to be really super\nnormal\u2014may conveniently be classed as premonitions, there is no\ndifficulty in attributing them to clairvoyance or telepathy, since the\nfacts on which the future event depended were in all probability\u2014\nas Mr. Piddington's enquiries show\u2014known at the time to persons\nwho may telepathically have influenced Miss Walker's dream.\nMiss Walker writes :\u2014\n13, Stafford Mansions, Albert Bridge Road, London, S.W.,\nApril 26th, 1900.\nDEAR MR. PIDDINGTON,\u2014You asked me to send you a written statement\nabout a dream, and I do so with much pleasure.\nIn June, 1897, my youngest brother, B., having passed the examination\nfor a clerkship in Somerset House, but being unable to obtain the actual\nappointment until a vacancy occurred, threw up work he was then doing in\nLondon and went home to Devonshire, intending to take a month or two of\nholiday before entering Somerset House.\nHe was not able to get any information as to when a vacancy would\noccur, as there are no age retirements, and could only learn that the\nvacancies averaged three a year.\nI remained in London. My brother waited at home a whole year and no\nvacancies occurred.\nOne night in June, 1898\u2014I cannot give the exact date, but I think it was\nabout the 20th or 23rd\u2014I dreamt that my brother received his appointment\non the 19th of July. There was nothing else in the dream\u2014merely the one\n\fFEB., 1901.] Cases. 2ft\nperfectly vivid fact of the date. I thought very little of it, but in writing\nto my brother in a day or two, I mentioned that I had had this dream, and\nthat I hoped it was a good omen.\nNaturally no one attached any importance to it, and the letter was in due\ncourse destroyed ; though my brother did not forget it, and kept the date in\nhis head.\nOn the 19th of July he received an official notice from Somerset House\nthat he was appointed to a clerkship there, and telegraphed to me to that\neffect.\nWe have much regretted since that the letter was destroyed, but the fact\nof the dream and the date was known to all my family before its fulfilment ;\nand I send you the signature of the brother concerned, and of other members\nof the family who can testify to the accuracy of this statement.\u2014Yours\nfaithfully, AGNES E. WALKER.\nThe signatures of other members of Miss Walker's family follow her\nown, as below :\u2014\nBERNARD S. WALKER.\nCHARLES H. WALKER..\nJ. B. WALKER.\nETHEL A. WALKER.\nE. I. WALKER.\nN. WALKER.\nIn reply to enquiries, Miss Walker writes again to Mr. Piddington :\u2014\nJune 25th [1900].\n. . . My brother's name was first in the list for a whole year, for the next\nappointment, which could only be given in case of a death or retirement. In\nhis case a vacancy occurred by the retirement of some one in one of the pro\nvincial branches, which was filled up\u2014as I believe they always are\u2014from\nSomerset House, and caused a general move up. It seems most probable\nthat a few weeks before my brother received his appointment these coming\nchanges must have been known to the Registrar, and he would, I should\nthink, be most likely to note the next name on the list.\nI find that the official letter, informing my brother of his appointment,,\nis dated July 18th, and is signed by Mr. David Owen, the head\nregistrar. . . .\nAGNES E. WALKER.\nMr. Piddington writes :\u2014\nNovember Uth, 1900.\nIn an interview which I had with the Head Registrar at Somerset House-\nthis morning, he informed me that the fact of a vacancy having occurred\nwould certainly be known either to himself or to some other of the officials\nsome weeks before the next appointment would be made, and the first name\non the list of successful candidates would be noted. Consequently, if the\n\f30 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [FEB., 1901.\ncase be not regarded as one of pure coincidence, we can suppose that Miss\nA. E. Walker in her dream state acquired her information telepathically\nfrom one of the Somerset House officials ; for, although the Head Registrar\ndid not say that the precise date of a new appointment would be settled as\nsoon as a vacancy was known to have occurred, still it is permissible to\nassume that the approximate date would or could then be known to the\nofficial or officials interested.\nAs to the evidence of the actual date of Mr. Walker's appointment,\nMr. Piddington writes later :\u2014\nNovember 20th, 1900.\nMiss A. E. Walker has sent me the official letter signed by the Senior\nRegistrar, D. N. (or D. W.) Owen. It is dated July 18th, 1898, and is\naddressed to B. S. Walker, Esq. The envelope, an official one, bearing the\nstamp of the \" High Court of Justice, Probate Registry,\" bears also the\nfollowing post-mark : \" London. 6.30 p.m. Official paid. 16. 18 Jy. 98.\"\n\u2022(16 is presumably a post-office mark which signifies the mail by which the\nletter was dispatched). The letter is addressed to Bernard S. Walker, Esq.,\nWalkhampton, Horrabridge, S. Devon. But the Horrabridge post-mark is\nnot on the envelope. Doubtless, though, a letter dispatched from London\nat 6.30 p.m. on July 18th would reach Horrabridge on July 19th.\nP. 270. Dream.\nThe following case of the finding of a lost object through a dream\u2014\nthough it too may for convenience be classed as a premonition\u2014does\nnot of course afford evidence of any supernormal faculty at all, since\nit most likely depended on unconscious memory. It is probable\nthat the percipient took note subliminally\u2014through hearing or some\nother sense\u2014of the fall of the cross at the time, and that this sub\nliminal perception was recollected by her in the dream. The case\nmay be compared with several others of the same kind given in Mr.\nMyers' paper on \" The Subliminal Consciousness : Hypermnesic Dreams,\"\nin Proceedings S.P.R., vol. viii. pp. 362-404 ; see also a case given by\nMr. Myers in a paper in vol. xi. p. 397.\nThe percipient in the present case is a friend of Mr. Andrew Lang's,\nto whose kindness we owe the account. She writes :\u2014\nHolydean, St. Boswells, N.B., October 16th, 1900.\nIn April, 1892, I had given to me an old cross of very good old paste and\n\/good design, which I shortly afterwards wore, for the first time, at the\ntheatre. On reaching home in the evening I found that I had dropped it or\nhad it stolen, and went to bed mourning its loss.\nOn falling asleep I dreamed what actually had happened\u2014that I had lost\nit on my way from the theatre \u2014but then fancied that I found myself, in\n\fFEB., 1901.] Cases. 31\nbroad daylight, in the drawing room of the house in Place, W., where\nI was then staying, and which overlooked the front door. In my dream I\nlooked out of the window and saw, lying in the gutter immediately in front\nof the door, my cross, and rushed downstairs and into the street and picked\nit up.\nIn the morning I had quite forgotten my dream, but in the afternoon\nwhen I was having tea in the drawing room with my [hostess], she spoke of\nthe cross I had lost and the unlikelihood of my ever seeing it again. I then\nremembered the dream, and told her about it.\n\" I went forward to the window,\" I said, \" and looked out, and there it was,\nlying in the gutter, close to the kerb.\"\nShe laughed, and we both went to the window and looked out, and just\nthen the sun caught on something lying in the gutter, just at the kerb.\nIt was the old paste cross. t\nJEANIE LANG BLAIKIE.\nThe lady with whom Miss Blaikie was staying at the time adds the\nfollowing corroborative note, but desires that her name should not be\npublished :\u2014\nAs far as I remember, this is quite correct.\n(Signed in full.)\nL. 1123. Vision.\nThe next case relates to an apparently telepathic vision. It was sent\nto us by Mr. David Fraser Harris, Lecturer on Physiology at St.\nAndrew's University. The percipient, he informs us, is a gentleman\nof Austrian extraction in business in London, who gives his name, but\ndoes not wish it to be published. The account was sent to us in a\nletter dated September 23rd, 1900, and is as follows :\u2014\nA few years ago pressing business prevented my returning home to London\nat the end of the week, and as I did not care to spend Sunday at Manchester,\nI went on the Saturday afternoon to Matlock Bath with the intention of\nspending a quiet Sunday there and returning by an early train on Monday\nmorning. On arrival at my destination\u2014a small private hotel not very far\nfrom Matlock Bath station\u2014I immediately ordered tea and went to the\nsitting-room to warm myself, as it was a raw, cold day in January with a lot\nof snow about and the temperature many degrees below freezing point.\nI happened to be the only visitor at the hotel, and I made myself com\nfortable in a large easy-chair before a cheerful fire, waiting for my tea. It\nwas hardly dark enough to light the gas and not light enough to see to read.\nMy back was turned to the window, and I was not thinking of anything in\nparticular ; I was in a kind of passive, tranquil mood, when suddenly I\nseemed to become oblivious to my surroundings, and in place of the dark\nwall and the pictures facing me, I saw the front of my house in London, with\n\f32 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [FEB., 1901.\nmy wife standing at the door speaking to a working man who held a large\nbroom in his hands. My wife had a very concerned look, and I felt sure that\nthe man was in great distress. I could not and did not of course hear what\nwas spoken, but a strong intuition told me that the man was asking my\nwife's assistance. At that 'moment the servant entered the room with my\ntea and the scene I had just seen vanished and I again realized where I was.\nI was, however, so strongly impressed, and so convinced of the reality of what\nI had seen, that after tea I wrote a letter to my wife, telling her of the\nstrange occurrence, and asking her to make inquiries about the man and to\nassist him as much as possible.\nWhat had actually occurred was this : A boy knocked at the door of my\nhouse (which is roughly 140 or 145 miles away from where I was) and asked\nthe servant whether he might sweep the snow away from the pavement and\ndoorway for a penny. Whilst the boy was speaking a poorly clad and ill-\nlooking man came and said, \" Please let me sweep away the snow ; this boy-\nvery likely will only spend the penny in sweets, whilst I want it for bread.\nI have a wife and four children all ill at home, we have no food and not even\na fire and nothing more to pawn, and owe rent.\" The servant asked the man\nto wait whilst she went and told my wife, who came to the door and spoke\nto the man. He repeated his statement to her, and added that he was a\npainter out of work and had been ill and that he and his family were in great\ndistress, but that he did not want to go to the workhouse for relief, if he\ncould only get work of some kind.\nIt was this scene that I witnessed at the very moment it happened and\nwhich was probably communicated to me through the impression the man's\ndistress made upon my wife's mind.\nThe rest of the story is simply this : My wife told the man she would call\nat his home in the course of the afternoon and see what [could] be done, which\nshe did and found that the man had told the truth. She helped the poor\nfamily with money, clothing, food and fuel as far as possible, and needless to\nKay was very much astonished when she received my letter on Monday\nmorning which told her what I had seen. A few days afterwards I saw\nthe man and instantly identified him as the man I had seen in my strange\nvision. He subsequently obtained a situation as milkman, and for about a\ncouple of years regularly called in our neighbourhood with a milk barrow.\nMr. Harris obtained for us the following letter of corroboration\nfrom the percipient's wife ; who had unfortunately not kept the\nletter in which he had described his experience to her at the time.\nOctober 4th, 1900.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014As requested by your letter of the 26th to Mr. respecting\nthe story of his vision he sent you, I beg to testify to the truth and correct\nness in every particular of the account as sent to you.

He was formerly a doctor in the Brazilian army. Having\nretired from this post while still young, he spends much of his leisure\nin the study of so-called occult subjects, in which, however, he is\nrather a reader than an experimenter. I know him to be candid and\nscrupulous, so much so that his statements may be considered to have a\nhigh evidential value. The account he gives of his experience is\nsufficiently clear to dispense with any further preliminary remarks.\nRio de Janeiro, December 30th, 1900.\nOn the 4th of October, 1898, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the morning, I\nsaw in a dream the form of Sr. Ignacio E. Monteiro, the manager of the\nPostal Department in the State of Parahyba. [He was related to me by\nmarriage], being the husband of one of my aunts.\nThe dream scene in which we figured was that of a railway or tramcar\nstation. I saw distinctly the inner face of the rails, polished to brightness\nby the friction of the wheels.\n\f34 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAR., 1901.\nThe form of this relative of mine appeared with all the vividness of\nreality on one side of the station, while I stood on the other side, the road\nwhere the rails were running between us.\nHe tendered to me with much insistence a set of papers, which he held in\nhis left hand. There was some eight or ten sheets, the edges of which were\nseparated. Although longer than letter paper, they were not so broad as\nordinary foolscap. On the top of these were two smaller sheets, which were\nmuch rumpled.\nI crossed the line quickly (some train or electric car was about to start),\nand on stretching out my hand to receive the papers, the vision ceased and I\nimmediately woke up.\nThe day was just breaking.\nSo vivid was my dream that it produced on me a profound impression. I\nrose and at once narrated my experience to my wife, who occupied a room\nadjoining mine.\nOn the very same day I told my dream to Second Lieutenant Cyriaco\nLopes, asking him to take note of the details related (e.g. the delivery of the\npapers) so that we might form a just estimate of their value in case the death\nof my relative should take place.\nOn the following day Second Lieutenant Cyriaco, on passing by my house,\nshowed my wife a telegram of the daily paper, 0 Paiz, announcing the\ndecease of Sr. Ignacio E. Monteiro.\nI wrote to the son of the latter gentleman, relating what had occurred and\nrequesting him at the same time to give me, if it were possible, some satis\nfactory explanation respecting the papers tendered to me by his father.\nI annex to this [deposition] the letter containing my request and the reply\nof Second Lieutenant Alvaro E. Monteiro, who having returned to Rio de\nJaneiro some months afterwards, informed me that his father died at mid\nday on the 4th of October, but that between 4 and 6 o'clock in the morning\nof the same day the sick man passed through a crisis so grave that all\nthe persons in the house were alarmed and convinced that he was dying then\nand there.\nI also subjoin the letter received from Second Lieutenant Cyriaco Lopes,\nwhom I requested to reply to questions drawn up by me. . . .\n(Signed) DR. CINCINNATO HENRIQUES DA SILVA.\nDonna Etelvina, the wife of Dr. Cincinnato, corroborates her husband's\nstatements. At first she was inclined to attach but small importance to\nthe dream, and by the afternoon of the following day she had so far\nforgotten about it that, when Second Lieutenant Cyriaco Lopes informed\nher of its confirmation by telegram, she was momentarily at a loss to\nunderstand what had been confirmed. The facts were afterwards well\nimpressed on her memory by the strangeness of the coincidence. Her\ndeposition here follows :\u2014\n\fMAR., 1901.] Account of a Telepathic Dream. 35\nJanuary 23rrf, 1901.\nWith respect to the dream in which my husband saw the form of Sr.\nIgnacio E. Monteiro, I have to declare that the said dream was related to me\non the very day [of its occurrence], in the early morning, one day before the\ndaily paper, 0 Paiz, published the telegram announcing the decease of that\ngentleman. I also recall, as if it were yesterday, that my husband related it\non the same day to Lieutenant Cyriaco Lopes, who on the day following\npassed by our house and said to me, \"The dream of Dr. Cincinnato has been\nrealized : Sr. Ignacio E. Monteiro is dead.\" He [then] showed me the\ntelegram of 0 Paiz. I can guarantee that this is a true statement of the\nfacts. (Signed) ETELVINA B. DA SILVA.\nAt the time when the first steps were taken to collect evidence for\nthis case Second Lieutenant Cyriaco was at Bage' in the State of Rio\nGrande. Dr. Cincinnato sent him a letter containing questions, the\nanswer to which arrived from the south about the same time that the\nwriter of it returned to Rio on his way to Para.\nIt will be seen that the lieutenant's replies are very laconic, but they\nserve their purpose. The questions are transcribed in his letter, which\nis dated from Bage, December 28th, 1900.\n(1st) Did I really tell you the dream in which the father of Second\nLieutenant Alvaro Evaristo Monteiro appeared to me ?\nYou did.\n(2nd) Did you hear that I, or any one else, had any knowledge of the\ndecease of Lieutenant Alvaro's father at the time when I related the said\n<lream to you ?\nYou did not. There was no thought about the matter.\n(3rd) Was this, or was this not, on the same day of the dream related to you 1\nIt was.\n(4th) On what day did you show me a telegram inserted in 0 Paiz\nannouncing the decease of Captain Ignacio Evaristo Monteiro, the father of\nLieutenant Alvaro 1\nI cannot determine the day, but I may state that I remember quite well\nthat it was subsequent to the day on which you told me of the dream.\nOn Sunday, the 20th of January, 1901, I met both Cyriaco Lopes\nand Alvaro Monteiro at the house of Dr. Cincinnato. The former can\nsay nothing more than that the dream was told him on one day and\nthat on some subsequent occasion he saw the telegram, and passing by\nDr. Cincinnato's house in the afternoon, spoke to Donna Etelvina at the\nwindow. He then told her that her husband's dream had been\nconfirmed.\nThe letter sent by Dr. Cincinnato to Alvaro Monteiro is valuable\ninasmuch as it contains the first account of his dream written shortly\nafter it had occurred. It is dated from Rio on the 18th of October,\n\f36 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAR., 1901.\n1898. After a few words of condolence with his cousin Dr. Cincinnato\nAs our long companionship and interchange of ideas have made you\nacquainted with my opinions respecting our spiritual life, which, for my part, I\nhold to be more proved than anything else, [I must ask you tojgive me a hearing.\nOn the 2nd or 3rd inst.1\u2014in any case on the day immediately preceding\nthat on which 0 Paiz gave a telegraphic announcement of the death of your\nfather\u2014at 5 o'clock in the morning\u2014I mean to say, between 5 and 6 o'clock\nin the morning\u2014I dreamed I saw your father standing in a railway or\ntramcar station, holding some sheets of paper in his left hand and [seeming]\nvery anxious that I should receive them. He wore a greyish coat, and the\npapers (some eight or ten sheets) were open, and not folded or rolled up.\nThey were smaller than foolscap ; [the edges of] the sheets did not coincide\nwith each other, but were spread out in different directions. [I have\nalready said that] the number of sheets seen by me was about eight or ten.\nOn these written papers were two small sheets also open and containing\nwriting. The latter were somewhat rumpled and their size was that of small\nnote paper. There was a station with a double line. I was on the side on\nwhich the engines went out of the station, and he was on the side of the\narrival of the trains or tramcars. On my side the rails shone with the\nfriction of the wheels. All this I saw as distinctly as if the scene I describe\nto you had been real. He insisted on my crossing the line and receiving the\npapers. I did so and immediately the vision passed away and I awoke.\nIt was just growing light, but as it has been raining almost always,\nand the mornings, as usual here at this time of year, have been consequently\ndark, I suppose that my dream took place between 5 and 6 o'clock a.m.\nI assure you that on awaking I received such an impression of reality from\nthe scene I had witnessed that I was at once convinced that your father had\neither died within the twelve hours preceding the dream, or that he was dying.\nAs soon as I rose I narrated the above experience to Chinota,2 to whom I\ndeclared that I was sure of what had happened to your father.\nOn the evening of the same day Cyriaco Lopes was with me at my house.\nI gave him a detailed account of the dream, and asked him to let me know of\nany news he might receive in reference to the health of your father. Next\nday, in the afternoon, he told Chinota that he had seen that day's telegram,\nthat is, the telegram giving the news of your father's death, and published\non the day following that of the dream.\nIf my memory does not fail me, it was the first time I ever dreamed\nof him. What I can assure you is that it was the first time I ever dreamed\nof any person in such a manner as to conclude that that person had died. It\nwas you that gave me the last news I had of your father, and I recollect your\ntelling me that he was fairly well, although his health had not been of the\nvery best.\n1 Dr. Cincinnato affirms that this date is wrong. \u2014A.

Lieutenant Alvaro's reply furnishes a\nplausible explanation of the papers seen by the percipient in the hand\nof Sr. Ignacio Monteiro. Writing from Parahyba, on the 18th of\nNovember, 1898, he says :\nLet me see whether I can find an explanation for your dream. When\nfather fell ill, and knew that he was going to die, he became much troubled\nabout the future of his family, and, as he had but a short time to live, he sent\nfor Agnello,1 and asked him to go to the Fiscal Office (Delegacia, Fiscal) and\npay the monthly contribution to the pension fund corresponding to October.\nThis it was not possible to do [in time to tranquillize his mind],2 for when\nAgnello returned with the receipt the death had taken place.\nAs soon as I received your letter I examined father's papers, and I found\nten receipts corresponding to the ten monthly payments made by him after\nhis dismissal from the place of manager of the Postal Department.\nFather was not unaware that there is great delay in the despatch of\npension schedules, especially when there is no one in Rio to hurry on the\nprocess, and his mind naturally reverted to [Senator] Alvaro Machado, or\nsomebody else likely to take an interest in his affairs. Perhaps he thought\nof you as a relative of the family and a resident in Rio. This is the only\nexplanation of the case that occurs to me. . . . (Signed) ALVARO.\nIn reply to verbal questioning Lieutenant Alvaro Monteiro informed\nme that the cause of his father's death was defective action of the mitral\nvalve of the heart. The decease occurred at mid-day on the 4th of\nOctober, 1898 ; but between 4 and 6 o'clock on the same morning, that\nis to say, just about the time of Dr. Cincinnato's dream,8 he passed\nthrough a severe crisis, believed that his last moment had already\ncome, and called the members of his family to his bedside. He did\nnot, however, lose consciousness on this occasion, nor did he, so far as\nLieutenant Alvaro can recollect, mention Dr. Cincinnato by name. The\nnature of his disease was discovered only some four days before he died.\nHe was 65 years old ; other members of his family had died about that\nage, and this led him, even before his final illness, to apprehend that he\nhimself would not long be spared. After the death, Second Lieutenant\nAlvaro looked over his father's papers and found the ten receipts of the\n1 Dr. Agnello was Sr. Monteiro's son-in-law.\u2014A.A.\n2 The words between square brackets are inserted to avoid an apparent contradiction.\nLieutenant Alvaro explained to me that that was what he wanted to say.\u2014A.A.\n3 The time at Parahyba is 32 m. 32 s. in advance of that at Rio.\u2014A.A.\n\f38 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

With regard to the mise\nen seine of the vision, it is not unimportant to remark that there is\nbetween Parahyba and the coast a railroad of about 18 kilometers in\nlength, over which any one would have to pass in going to, or coming\nfrom, Eio de Janeiro. In the dream image Sr. Ignacio Monteiro was\nseen dressed in a light greyish coat, and holding the papers in his left\nhand : in reality he was right-handed ; but when at home he usually\nwore a light silk coat of pale yellow or straw colour.\nAt the time of his dream Dr. Cincinnato was in a normal state\nof health. There was nothing to induce him to turn his thoughts\nmore especially to his relative in the north. He knew that Sr. Ignacio\nMonteiro suffered from bronchitis ; but he was not aware that he had\nheart disease. If he formed any supposition at all on the subject, it\nwas that his relative was fairly hale for his age. He insists that he was\nmuch impressed by the unusual distinctness of the dream image. . . .\nAs measured on Delamarche's map of Brazil, the linear distance\nbetween Rio and Parahyba do Norte is in round numbers 1700\nkilometres.\nAt the Public Library of Rio I found the following telegram in\n0 Paiz of Wednesday, the 5th of October, 1898.\nParahyba, 4[th of October].\nThe death occurred to-day of the ex-manager of the Postal Department,\nIgnacio Evaristo Monteiro, who had lately been acting as manager of the\nCashier's Department in the State Revenue Office.\nThis fixes the date both of the decease and the dream.\nCASES.\nP. 271.\nThe following letter appeared in Light of December 8th, 1900,\nunder the heading \" A Problem for Telepathists \" :\u2014\nI wish to give the following test in the interest of all psychical\nresearchers, more especially of those who, entirely believing in clairvoyance,\nyet hold it to be only varied forms of thought-reading or thought-projection.\nIn February last I called upon Madame Zuleika without making any\nappointment, but going on a sudden impulse which I put down to spirit\nguidance, having had many experiences of this before. She told me that\nmy husband was going at once to South Africa, and that I should not see\nhim before he went unless I made a special effort ; that he could not come\nand see me, as expected, but that I should have to go to him. She warned\n\fMAB., 1901.] Cases. 39\nme that I must be careful to get all papers relating to business and also his\nwill, before he left, as she saw that he would not live out the year. I\ndemurred to this, giving her my reasons, but she said she was sure of the\nfact, as his \"span was run.\" When she said this I felt intuitively that\nwhat she predicted would happen at the fall of the year, and pictured\nNovember as the time in my mind.\nEverything came to pass exactly as Madame Zuleika foretold. My\nhusband got sudden orders to proceed to South Africa. I had to rise from\na sick bed to go and meet him, and he, although enjoying excellent health\nuntil November, died after a short illness early in that month. These facts\nwere told at the time to several relations in confidence, but not to my\nhusband, and they can all bear witness to the exact veracity of this\nstatement. I am not a personal friend of Madame Z.'s, and have never seen\nher before or since that one time, but I think in justice to her this ought to\nbe published,\u2014as well as in the interests of psychical research.\nVERITAS.\nAn Associate of the Society for Psychical Research was kind enough\nto put Mr. J. G. Piddington into communication with \"Veritas,\" who\nin answer to a request for further information, wrote :\u2014\nI have no objection to giving you my name and address, also the names\nand addresses of the relations to whom I told what Madame Zuleika had\npredicted almost directly after my stance with her\nOn [a certain day in] February, 1900, directly after breakfast, when I was\nno more thinking of going into London than taking a journey to the moon\n(I lived at X) [X is a suburb some 12 miles out of London], I felt strongly\nimpressed to go to Madame Zuleika. It was extremely inconvenient for me\nto leave the house and I put away the impression, but it became stronger\nthan ever, and it ended in my starting in a great hurry, hardly giving myself\ntime to dress.\nI had never seen Mme. Z. in my life, and as I lived right away at X and\nnever frequent Spiritualist meetings or any others (excepting Mrs. Besant's\nlectures, which are far too crowded to admit of any ordinary person being\nnoticed) the assumption that Mme. Z. had ever seen me or known anything\nof me is, I think, wildly improbable. I am therefore quite certain I was an\nabsolute stranger to her.\nShe said at once, \" You came by impression\u2014you are sent to me to hear\nsomething important.\" She then told me she saw (in a clairvoyant picture,\nI afterwards learnt) my husband just starting on a voyage, and told me the\nfacts narrated in Light. I said to her, \" Oh ! no wonder you think everybody\ngoing to South Africa doomed, but I must explain to you my husband is not\na combatant officer, . . . and he is also a very strong man.\" She replied, \" I\nam sure of his death\u2014his span is run. I see it, and he will not live out the\nyear.\" I then myself saw a little picture of the year, . . . and November\nstood out, so I supposed that would be the time intuitively. Just then she\nwas distracted by seeing a picture of my youngest son, whom she . , .\n\f40 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAR., 1901.\ndescribed and told me a great many things about. She then reverted to my\nhusband's death, and said : \" But the reason you have been sent here is to\nget all business papers at once from your husband,\u2014his will, his insurance,\nall his papers,\u2014or you will have a lot of trouble and expense. This you must do\nat once (he was in [a distant part of the country]) as he will be going directly.\"\nI did not know my husband was going for certain, but thought it probable.\nI said, \" Oh, but I know he would come and see us before he goes and I will\nask him about business, but he won't like it.\" She said, \" No, write, and at\nonce, he is going so soon and you won't see him ; he won't come to you ;\nyou can only see him by going to him and you will have to make an effort.\"\nShe urged me further strongly to see about the business affairs, and then the\nstiance proceeded and many other things of a marvellous interest were told me.\nWell, I wrote to my husband that same day ; got no answer till [6 days\nlater] when he wrote he was to sail for South Africa [in 6 days' time] and\nwould spend a day or so with us. That same day I fell ill ... and was so bad\nthat next day I kept my bed, when at 11 o'clock at night a special telegram\narrived saying, \" Meet me without fail at Waterloo, train leaves 8 a.m. for\nSouthampton, sail to-morrow.\" [This latter date was 2 days earlier than his\nletter had stated], and the ship sailed on [that day]. So it all came to\npass as Mme. Z. had told me, and I had to make \" the effort,\" and got up and\nwent off by a very early train next morning with my son, and in all the\nconfusion and in so short a time no business could be well discussed. In\nfact, he wouldn't listen to anything of the sort, and said there was no necessity.\n\"He wasn't going to be killed.\" The result has been disastrous in a\npecuniary way and has caused and is still causing the greatest trouble and\nexpense. . \" . .

V.\nP.S.\u2014The events are recorded in my diary.\nThe question whether the fulfilment of a prophecy of this kind is to\nbe regarded as accidental or not of course depends very much on the\namount of detail on it. But, in estimating this, we must be careful to\ndistinguish between details that are associated with or contingent on\none another and those that are independent. Thus, it was not unlikely\nin the first place that Mme. Zuleika should imagine that the husband\nof \" Veritas \" was going to South Africa ; this would naturally suggest\nthe idea of his death there, and the desirability of arranging his\nbusiness affairs before he went would be an almost inevitable corollary.\nSo far, the number of details add hardly anything to the improbability\nof the prediction being fulfilled by chance ;\u2014if the first part of it came\ntrue, the others were likely to follow. On the other hand, the other\ntwo main details predicted,\u2014(a) that he would be prevented from\ncoming to visit his family before he went, and (b) that \"Veritas\"\nherself would have to make a special effort to go and see him ;\u2014while\ninherently rather more improbable, are also more independent both of\n\fMAR., 1901.] Cases. 41\nthe first set and of one another, and therefore their fulfilment adds\nconsiderably to the presumption against chance or guessing as an\nexplanation of the whole.\n\" Veritas \" gave us the names and addresses of six persons to whom\nshe had spoken of Mme.

She was much impressed at having\n'been told that her husband, Captain V., would cross the sea and go to a great\ndistance, that he would not outlive another year, and that it was impera\ntively necessary for her to get from him all papers relating to business, his\nwill, etc., before his departure. It was also stated that she would not meet\nhim again, unless she made a great effort to do so.\nAll subsequently fell out exactly as Madame Zuleika had predicted, Mrs.\nV. having to rise from a sick bed to go and see her husband at Waterloo,\non his way through London for South Africa.

In the course of conversation Mrs. V. told me that some days\nsince, on waking in the morning, she felt such a strong inclination to visit\nMme. Zuleika that she started off for that purpose as soon as possible.\nAmong other prophecies, Madame Zuleika foretold that Captain V. would\ndie in the course of the year, and that unless Mrs. V. made a great effort she\nwould not see her husband again. Captain V. was, I think, in at the\ntime, and I understood Mrs. V. to say that very soon after her interview\nwith Madame Zuleika, she received one day a telegram or letter from her\nhusband, saying that he would be passing through London early next\nmorning on his way to South Africa, and begged her to come and meet him\nat the station if possible.\nAt great trouble and inconvenience to herself Mrs. V. went into town\nearly next morning, and saw her husband for the last time.\nIn November, as has already been stated, Captain V. died.\n(Signed) O.

Not\nhaving been able to obtain more details, we now print the case as it\nstands. Mrs. Jephson's first letter on the subject was as follows :\u2014\nPanton Cottage, Union Road, [Cambridge], March 23rd [1899].\nDEAR MR. MYERS,\u2014Do you remember coming to see me at Cromwell\nLodge, Trumpington Street, [Cambridge], a few years ago concerning various\nnoises and visions we heard and saw there ? We left last year and moved to\nthe above address : since then the house has been bought, and is being\npulled more or less to pieces, and three skulls have been found just outside\nour dining-room windows\u2014close underneath the rooms where we saw and\nheard the various uoises. One is a woman they tell me, and the other two\nare men. They are placed in the Archaeological Museum. Of course there\nmust have been a murder committed, or no one would be buried on private\nproperty. ... E. J. JEPHSON.\nMrs. Jephson afterwards sent Mr. Myers brief written particulars\n(which she had already told him\u2014it appears\u2014orally) of the experiences\nreferred to above, in a letter dated April 26th, 1899. The first\nnarrative relates to her own experiences ; the second to those of her\nservant in the same house.\n(1)1 cannot describe the peculiar feeling that crept over me when one night\nabout 12 o'clock I felt the touch of a hand, or as I thought that of the paw\nof my pet collie, who usually slept on my bed, but on putting out my hand\nto caress him I came in contact with an icy being instead of a lovely warm-\ncoated creature. On looking up in astonishment, I saw at the foot of the\nbed a beautiful vision\u2014a most ethereal face\u2014oval in shape, with piercing\nviolet eyes, and a mouth of speaking sympathy. I said, \"What do you\nwant ?\" She replied, \" I only come to tell you your son has just arrived\nsafely at Perth.\" She vanished, but with the declaration she would come\nagain. It was perfectly true that my sou did arrive at Perth at the hour\nnamed. Once more did she appear to me at night to tell me of illness which\nthe post only proved too true.\nThe curious noises about the house it is [possible] to understand on\nordinary grounds (because rats and mice often cause bells to ring, and that\noccurred constantly), but the interesting part of the matter is as follows :\n\f44 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAR., 1901.\ni. Footsteps on the stairs at early hours, from 1\u20144 or so.\nii. Footsteps overhead, when on searching the rooms no one was found.\niii. Knockings in a grate at 2 o'clock in the morning, like the hammering\nin of nails. These and other things give the house a strange interest.\n(2) On going to bed one night about 10 I was startled by a lovely face\ngazing at me just beside the bedroom door ; it seemed that of a young girl,\nand she wore a hood with a dark-coloured exterior, which covered her\nshoulders. I was so frightened that I screamed out and threw away both\ncandlesticks and hat, etc., and fell down. Though there were several people\nin the house, no one seemed to hear me, on account of their talk and games,\nso I do not know how long I lay on the floor, only shall never forget the\nshock this apparition gave me. EMMA ELLIS.\nMrs. Jephson afterwards obtained for us the evidence of one of her\nlodgers, Mr. Joy, who wrote :\u2014\nApril 28th, 1899.\nI occupied two rooms at Cromwell Lodge, 4, Trumpington Street, Cam\nbridge, during terms from October 1889 to June 1892.\nI most certainly heard many noises, the causes of which I have never\nbeen able to discover. Often for a week or two bells would peal between 1\nand 2 a.m., and until I became tired of doing so, and was convinced that no\none outside pulled the street door bell, I frequently went downstairs and\nopened the front door (the bell ringing at intervals the while), or roamed\nabout the passages. There were other noises of the nature of tapping or\nhammering, which I put down to rats or mice.\nThe most extraordinary occurrence, however, happened in the early\nsummer of\u2014I think\u20141895. On that occasion an old college chum and I\nwere staying at Cromwell Lodge for a night, and were sleeping on the same\nfloor, but in different rooms. Before 1 was fully undressed I heard in the\nnext (an unoccupied sitting) room a noise like the rattling of teacups.\nWhen I had occupied the room in which I then was and the adjoining one\nregularly, I had kept my crockery in the cupboard under a bookcase. I\ntherefore concluded that my friend had knocked to attract my attention,\nand so shaken the bookcase and crockery in it, for the bookcase had stood\nwith its back to a wooden partition dividing the room in which it stood from\none nearer the front of the house, in which my friend was (his bed-head\nbacking on to the other side of the partition).\nI shouted to my friend asking what he wanted. He assured me he had\nnot knocked, and on opening my door, which led into my old sitting-room,\nI at once saw that there was no bookcase there. I had pictured the room\nas it was when I was in residence ! I went into my friend's room, smoked\na cigarette with him, and then went to bed. Half-an-hour afterwards the\nbells began. I have never been able to account for these things, and merely\nstate the facts. I may also add that my friend slept, or tried to sleep, on the\nfloor in my room, declining to sleep apart from me, and vehemently declar\ning that he would never sleep in the house again. G. P. J.\n\fMAR., 1901.] Cases. 45\nOn June 28th, 1899, Mrs. Jephson wrote:\u2014\nDEAR MR. MYERS,\u2014You may like to have the enclosed account of\nCromwell Lodge, written by Mr. Hadath, who was often in and out, though\nhe only slept there that one night. ... E. J. JEPHSON.\nThe following was the account enclosed :\u2014\nThis is the first time that I have attempted to put on record my experi\nences at Cromwell Lodge in January, 1896. I will now do so in the plainest\nmanner possible. The exact date I cannot fix accurately, though possibly I\nmight with the aid of a calendar ; it was, I think, on the 5th or 6th.\nI reached Cambridge towards noon, and in the scepticism of my mental\nattitude and the courage bred of daylight I begged Mrs. Jephson to allow me\nto occupy the \" haunted \" room. Before I left, I had arrived at the conclusion\nthat this term could be applied to every quarter of the house.\nMr. G. P. Joy, who also took part in the events of that night, arrived\nshortly afterwards.\nIn the evening, after dinner, we visited the rooms of an undergraduate\n(of Pembroke), situated in the lane which runs by the side of the University\nPress, and subsequently joined a party of his friends who were playing\npoker. Between eleven and twelve o'clock we returned to Cromwell Lodge.\nI wish to lay stress on the manner in which we employed that evening,\nbecause many games of cards produce a reflex action on my mind and\nmemory, so that when I have ceased playing I find my thoughts recurring\nto the incidents of the game, and I retire to rest with my mind abstracted\nfrom all matters except the details of the play.\nAnd it was so on that night. After we had chatted for some thirty\nminutes with Mrs. Jephson and I had gone to my room, I put out my light\nand prepared to sleep, totally oblivious of my surroundings and of the\ncharacter of the chamber I occupied, concerned only with the cards I had\nbeen holding, and with one hand in particular.\nIt would be unreasonable, therefore, to ascribe the impressions I subse\nquently received to the supposition that I had, unconsciously perhaps, pre\npared myself to experience the uncanny, or was in a state of nervous tension\nfavourable to its reception. My room was on the first floor, Mr. Joy\noccupying one adjoining. The position will, perhaps, be made clearer by\nthe following rough sketch [not reproduced here].\nThe space occupied by my bedroom and the drawing-room in this sketch\nhad at one time formed one large room, but it was then divided by a parti\ntion which did not reach to the ceiling, draped on my side by dark curtains.\nThese curtains faced the foot of my bed. On the other side of my bedroom,\nand behind the head of my bed, lay two rooms ; one used as a study, and\none that in which Mr. Joy was sleeping. From the head of the stairs to the\ndoors of my room and the drawing-room ran the passage.\nI had not been in bed ten minutes before I fell asleep, dreaming of the\ncards ; within another twenty minutes I awoke with a start. There was\n\f46 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAR., 1901,\nnothing to disturb me, but I felt that something was wrong. I sat up and\nstared into the darkness. Then suddenly, from behind the partition at the\nfoot of my bed, a sharp crashing noise resounded, continuing for the space of\nfive seconds or more. It was as if one had dashed on the floor a heavy\nload of china or glass, which had broken as it fell. I sat still and listened.\nWithin a few minutes it occurred again. Then through the wall I heard\nMr. Joy shouting to me, asking what I was doing. I had no appetite for\nmore, and fled to him without scruple, to find his astonishment on learning\nthat I was not responsible for the noise no less than my alarm. When I\nhad thrown on a blanket we proceeded to the passage, and met Mrs. Jephson\ncoming up the stairs with a light and her dog, a big collie.\nAt that moment out on the silence broke the bells,\u2014bells of many varieties\nof tone and strength ; it seemed as if every one in the house was ringing.\nNo gentle tinkle, to which a rat crossing the wires might give cause, but a\nsharp staccato peal. We rushed downstairs to the front door, opened it, and\nlooked out. It was a clear night, but not a figure was to be seen ; and the\nroad runs straight and broad in either direction, affording no hiding for a\nconsiderable distance. Nor could a practical joker have pulled any but the\nfront door bell.\nFor some minutes we waited behind the door, and then returned upstairs,\nthe dog following. We took up our stand outside the study, and so com\nmanded the passage which led to the drawing-room. A few minutes passed,\nand then, again from that quarter, and clearly in the hearing of us all, rose a\nnew noise. It seemed the loud beating of a tray with a stick or something\nsimilar. The dog, and I remember this distinctly, crouched against the wall,\ncowering. It ceased ; the bells, I think, pealed again, and all was still. We\nwaited awhile, and then, after bidding Mrs. Jephson a second good;night, I\nprocured a light, aud accompanied by Mr. Joy returned to my room. My\nobject was to obtain the bedclothes, not to complete the night there ; this\nwas done on the floor of Mr. Joy's room, but we did not go to sleep for\nsome two hours later, when at last the bells, which commenced pealing\nagain, and continued to peal at intervals, shrilly, harshly, loudly, had ceased.\nI have heard nothing like it before or since. It was impossible for any\nperson in the house to have rung them all at the same time and with that\nforce. The only two other occupants (besides those mentioned) were a young\nmaid and Mrs. Jephson's old servant ; they were safely in their room,\ntogether, I believe ; and the latter was not given to such humour. . . .\nOn the next morning the drawing-room whence the sounds proceeded\nremained intact, furniture and contents undisturbed. . . .\nI have to certify that the above is a plain, unexaggerated record of what\ntranspired, and that the manner of its telling detracts from rather than adds\nto the horror of its nature.\nE. G. HADATH.\n26, Queen's Road, West Didsbury, Manchester.\nMrs. Verrall adds the following note to Mrs. Jephson's narrative :\u2014\n\fMAR., 1901.] Cases. 47\nFebruary 21st, 1901.\nI was present on April 5th, 1899, when Mrs. Jephsou reminded Mr.\nMyers that she told him of her experiences in Cromwell Lodge some years\nbefore the discovery of the skulls. I heard her relate in detail the\noccurrences referred to in the above documents ; she answered all questions\nfully, and seemed to me a clear and trustworthy witness.\nMARGARET DE G. VERRALL.\nMETHODS OF SUBLIMINAL MENTATION.\nWE have received a communication from a member of the Society,\nMiss L. Bigg, of 40, Chester Terrace, Regent's Park, London, N.W.,\non the subject of the art of \" Cartomancy,\" or \" laying the cards.\"\nMiss Bigg states that she has known several instances of the fulfilment\nof predictions made by a friend of her own through \"reading\" an\nordinary pack of playing-cards, and that she desires to collect the\nexperiences of others with non-professional mediums in the same line,\nand to meet with some who may be willing to join in experiments with\nher either at the rooms of the S.P.R. or at her own house.\nIn the experiments she has made hitherto\u2014Miss Bigg tells us\u2014\nthe inquirer, without seeing any of the cards, shuffles the pack and\ncuts at random; then the medium proceeds to \"lay out\" the cards\u2014\nusually face upwards\u2014by some set plan (of which there are at least\nfive or six), and then \" reads \" them, usually interpreting each card\nin the same way ; but combinations of certain cards modify the meaning\nof single cards. A good medium, however, will point out the cards\nwhich lead to her conclusions, however rapidly she may \" read \" them.\nThe first question, of course, to be settled in any investigation of\nthis kind is whether the statements made by the medium with regard\nto facts normally unknown to her are sufficiently numerous, explicit,\nand detailed to be beyond explanation by chance or guesswork ; that\nshe does not\u2014like the ordinary \" fortune-teller \"\u2014simply make a\nlarge number of statements, some of which are almost certain to fit\nthe circumstances of everybody. Of this we cannot judge until we\nhave the full details of a number of cases before us. But, assuming\nfor the moment that knowledge is sometimes supernormally acquired by\nthe means described, it becomes an interesting problem what part the\ncards play in it. The most obvious theory is that they take the place of\na planchette, ouija-board, or tilting table, in facilitating the emergence\nor externalisation of the subliminal impressions of the medium ; that\n\f48 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAR., 1901.\nshe has acquired the habit of using them to distract her supraliminal\nattention from her other surroundings, and so leave freer scope for the\nsubliminal, as one may acquire the habit of using almost any object, e.g.\na crystal, towards the same end. On this theory the supposed super\nnormal knowledge is not in any way acquired through the cards ; they\nsimply help to bring it to the surface of the medium's mind. In order to\nprove that their function goes beyond this, and to support the hypothesis\nsometimes put forward of an actual pre-arrangement by some super\nnormal means of the cards in the hand of the person who shuffles them,\nwe should have to show : (a) that the particular plan of \" laying out \"\nused by the medium on any one occasion is determined before she has\nseen any of the cards, and is not varied from at all after seeing any of\nthem ; (b) that the same interpretation is always applied to the same\ncard or combination of cards ; (c) that some statement is made corre\nsponding to every card or combination, and not only to selections of\nthem arbitrarily chosen by the medium at the time. We should also,\nof course, require to know all the statements made and with what\ncards they were associated in each case.\nNow, supposing that there is any supernormal pre-arrangement of\nthe cards, it would seem that no medium would be required to \" read \"\nthem ; if she only does it by a set of rules, any one else could apply\nthe rules. In this case we should have to suppose that the knowledge\nis conveyed to the subliminal self of the person who shuffles the cards,\nand we might go on to suppose that he subliminally recognises them\nby touch and arranges them in a certain order corresponding to the\nknowledge in his subliminal consciousness, while all the time under\nthe impression that he is shuffling at random. Extravagant and com\nplicated as this hypothesis sounds, it is not incompatible with what has\nbeen observed in some few cases of automatic action.\nWhatever conclusion be reached, however, as to the modus operandi,\nit is certainly desirable that experiments should be made in any direction\nin which there seems a chance of finding the operation of supernormal\nfaculty of any kind ; and we hope that many of our readers may be\ninclined to co-operate with Miss Bigg or to try experiments on the same\nlines for themselves, in either case making at the time complete written\nrecords of all that occurs, without which such experiments cannot have\nany scientific value.\n\fNo. CLXXVIII.\u2014VOL.

Sidgwick, Dr. Charles Lloyd Tuckey, Dr. J. Venn,\nF.R.S., and Dr. Abraham Wallace.\nThe Chairman then drew the attention of the Members present to\nthe audited Statement of the Income and Expenditure of the Society\nduring 1900 which was on the table, and which would as usual be\nprinted in the Journal. A Statement of Assets and Liabilities on\nDecember 31st, 1900, showed a slight improvement in the position of\nof the Society during the year, no account being taken of the increasing\nvalue of the Library and of the stock of Proceedings.\nIn reference to the position of the Society, the Chairman pointed out\nthat, notwithstanding a large number of losses by death, resignation,\nand other causes, during the past twelvemonth, there had been a\nslight increase in the membership, both of the English Society and of\nthe American Branch. The total number of names on the list of the\nEnglish Society had increased from 946 to 951, and the number on\nthe list of the American Branch from 472 to 481.\nThere being no response to an invitation for remarks from the\nMembers present, the Chairman then declared the meeting closed.\nMEETING OF THE COUNCIL.\nThe Council met at the close of the Annual General Meeting above\nreported. Dr. Oliver Lodge, F.R.S., occupied the Chair. There were\nalso present, Dr. A. W. Barrett, Hon. E. Feilding, Mr. J. G. Piddington,\n\f52 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

H.\nMyers. Of the brilliant services which he rendered to Psychical\nEesearch they will always retain the most appreciative and grateful\nrecollection, and they look forward with confidence to the time when\nthe scientific world will join in their recognition of the great value of\nhis work.\nReport was made that the Annual General Meeting had been held\nand that Members of Council had been elected as stated above.\nDr. Oliver J.

J. G. PIDDINGTON announced that DR. OLIVER LODGE, F.R.S.,\nhad been elected President of the Society for the year.\nDR. LODGE then took the chair and delivered an address on his pre\ndecessor, Mr. F. W. H. Myers. He began by urging that the loss\nsustained by the Society in the death, within a few months, of two of\nits founders and leading members, irreparable though it was, ought to\nstimulate those who remained to fresh exertions. The work of the\npioneers\u2014the founding and handing on to posterity of a new science\u2014\nwas unaccomplished, and the workers who were still left must not be\npermitted to disband and scatter until their work was done.\nPassing then to dwell on the memory of the Society's late President,\nhe proceeded to point out that Myers' grasp of science was profound.\nDr. Lodge referred not so much to Myers' detailed knowledge of\nparticular sciences\u2014though he could, when necessary, master the bare\n\f54 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [APRIL, 1901.\ntechnical details\u2014as to his philosophic grasp of the principles and\nwider meanings of science, in this resembling the accurate and\ncomprehensive vision of Tennyson. During the last twenty-five years,\nin fact, Myers had been laying the foundations of a cosmic philosophy,\na comprehensive scheme of existence. No philosopher ever brought to\nhis task a mind so well stored with facts : from personal enquiry, from\nthe testimony of all the savants of Europe, he was intimately acquainted\nwith the workings of the mind in health and disease : he had studied\nevery abnormal condition, and had accumulated a vast storehouse of\nfacts and observations drawn from the little known regions of halluci\nnation, automatism, dreams, multiple personality, and the mechanism of\ngenius. It was Myers' peculiar function to bring the whole of these\nscattered phenomena to a common focus ; to discover the unity which\nunderlies their difference, and present them as a whole. His two\nvolumes on Human Personality, shortly to appear, would testify how\nvast was his grasp of the problems presented, and how profound his\ninsight.\nDr. Lodge then went on to consider the depth and assurance of\nMyers' own personal conviction of a future life. The years of struggle\nand effort and systematic thought had begotten in him a confidence as\nabsolute and supreme as is to be found in the holiest martyr or saint.\nAnd to himself it seemed that the conviction came not, as to the martyr\nand the saint, by faith, but as the result of a strenuous and life-long\nstruggle for knowledge. However attained, his conviction of a never-\nending future for the soul of man was fixed, and in his later years\nunwavering. In his own words :\n\" That hour may come when Earth no more can keep\nTireless her year-long voyage thro' the deep ;\nNay, when all planets, sucked and swept in one,\nFeed their rekindled solitary sun.\nNay, when all Suns that shine, together hurled,\nCrash in one infinite and lifeless world.\nYet, hold thou still, what worlds soe'er may roll,\nNought bear they with them master of the soul.\nShe shall endure and quicken and live at last\nWhen all, save souls, has perished in the past,\"\nA belief as intimate and as assured as his own was the legacy that\nFrederic Myers sought to leave to the race.\nMR. J. G. PIDDINGTON then read extracts from a paper by PRO\nFESSOR WILLIAM JAMES on Frederic Myers' services to Psychology.\nMr. James began by pointing out that the quest which Myers had put\n\fAPRIL, 1901.] General Meeting. 55\nbefore himself was that of evidence of immortality, and that his con\ntributions to Psychology were incidental to that quest. But the service\nwhich he rendered to Psychology was nevertheless of a very original and\nstriking kind. It was Myers who first definitely opened up the whole\nregion of the subconscious mind, and devised methods for investigating\nits resources, by crystal gazing, automatic writing, trance speaking,\nand the like. His great achievement was to bring unity into an\nassemblage of heterogeneous phenomena ; to show the analogies and\nresemblances between things seemingly so wide apart as hallucination,\ndemoniacal possession, hysteria, and the visions of genius ; to weave\nthem into a system.\nMyers showed that the great region of mental activity, which he\nnamed the subliminal, contained matter of various kinds, various in its\norigins and in its utility ; some was mere rubbish, lapsed fragments of\nmemory ; some the stuff of which day-dreams are made ; but here and\nthere we came across indications of faculties and modes of perception\nsuperior to those of common waking life.\nThe corner-stone of Myers' system was the conception that\nthe \" consciousness \" of the classic psychology is but a portion of\na larger whole\u2014a fragment of a spectrum\u2014an organism in per\npetual process of evolution. His evolutionary conception of conscious\nness was in the writer's view an hypothesis of first-rate philosophic\nimportance, and might be destined to play a leading part in\nthe psychology of the future. Whether Myers' hypotheses were, in\nfact, justified or not, they were at any rate far more plausible\nthan those of the classic psychology. Nature was everywhere\ngothic not classic ; and Myers, in contrast to the clearly defined and\nnicely articulated consciousness of the old psychology, presented us\nwith a vast aggregate of half-shaped, half-systematized, and partly\nincoherent phenomena\u2014a veritable jungle such as Nature herself is\nwont to show to the explorer.\nThe writer then contrasted the official view of the consciousness\nwhich survives death, an abstract mentality living on spiritual truth,\nand communicating ideal wisdom\u2014the academic platonizing Sunday-\nschool conception\u2014with the view of human survival presented by\nMyers.\nThe ordinary psychologist was a philosopher in the technical\nsense, a metaphysician with a fondness for logical abstractions.\nMyers was primarily a lover of life ; he loved human persons\nand human idiosyncrasies more than the eternal essences, the\ncrystal battlements, the platonic ideas. He was in psychology what\n\f56 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [APRIL, 1901.\na field naturalist is in biology. It was not logical analysis of\nfaculties, or the laboratory work of psychology which interested him,\nbut the mechanism in action : human beings as they lived and worked.\nWhatever verdict might ultimately be passed upon his work, he\nwould, it was likely, be long remembered as the pioneer who staked\nout and claimed for science a vast tract of mental wilderness.\nDR. LODGE then read part of a paper by PROFESSOR CHARLES\nRiCHET of Paris :\nM. RICHET pointed out that 'in Myers there was a felicitous\nblending of intellectual qualities apparently contradictory, the faith\nof a mystic with the wisdom and precision of the man of science : he\nwas at once a penetrating psychologist, a rigorous experimentalist, a\nprofound philosopher, and the ardent apostle of a new faith.\nAt his first meeting with Myers, in the early days of the Society\nfor Psychical Research, M. Richet was tempted to accuse him of\nundue credulity ; but he soon learned to appreciate his scientific\nhabit of thought, his passion for accuracy and his profound erudition.\nHenceforth, whenever the writer met with any new phenomenon, his\nfirst impulse was always to submit it to Myers' judgment. They\nunited in many investigations of clairvoyants, trance speakers, and\nspirit mediums, and M. Richet had abundant opportunities for\nadmiring Myers' ingenuity, industry, and indefatigable perseverance.\nTo Myers the success of the International Congresses of Experi\nmental Psychology at Paris, London, Munich, and again at Paris\nlast year was largely due. He compelled the adherents of the\nclassical psychology and philosophy to pay attention to the new\nproblems which he presented to them ; he rescued telepathy, pre\nmonitions, thought-transference and kindred subjects from the\nscientific ostracism which had hitherto excluded them from discussion,\nand he was able thus to enforce a hearing, not by his audacity, but\nby his rigid adherence to logical principles and scientific methods.\nHe did not live to witness the final triumph of his views, but he\nhad left the whole subject in a position very different to that which\nit occupied twenty years ago, and in the psychology of the future\nhis name would be handed down as one of its great pioneers.\nMR. FRANK PODMORE then read a paper dealing briefly with the\nservices rendered by Frederic Myers to the Society for Psychical\nResearch.\nFrom the foundation of the Society he had been one of its most\nactive members, and since the death of Edmund Gurney he had\ntaken an ever-increasing share in the ordinary routine work of its\n\fAPRIL, 1901.] General Meeting. 57\nadministration. To his activities in the research work done by the\nSociety his numerous and weighty contributions to the Journal\nand Proceedings bore eloquent testimony.\nMr. Podmore then touched upon Mr. Myers' philosophic work,\nand pointed out that even those who found themselves unable to accept\nwithout qualification the conclusions which he drew could unreservedly\nadmire the characteristic qualities of his genius as exhibited in this\npart of his work. One of his most conspicuous qualities was his\nassiduity ; as Edmund Gurney had once said, \" Whilst I am reading a\nbook Myers will master a literature.\" He possessed also a marvellous\npower of generalisation and of classification. The latter gift, the\nspeaker thought, was of special value in researches such as those\nundertaken by the Society. Even though later knowledge should\nupset some of the principles of classification, the power to bring order\n\u2014if only provisional order\u2014into a vast assemblage of heterogeneous\nphenomena was of great practical utility, inasmuch as it facilitated\ndiscussion and provoked further investigation. It was moreover a\nrare quality.\nOf the richness and fertility of Myers' mind it was difficult to speak,\nexcept in terms which to those who did not know his work must sound\nextravagant. No one, in fact, could read any of Myers' writings with\nout gaining innumerable glimpses of new order in the materials and\nfresh side-lights on old problems.\nHis literary gifts were too well known to need much comment. But\nmembers of the Society who had frequently heard him speak extempore,\nor rise to meet some emergency, could appreciate the wonderful richness\nand beauty of his language even in such unstudied utterances,\nwhen he chose to be brief, and of many good things to choose only\nthe best, more even than in his prepared and more elaborate essays.\nIt was of interest to recall in this connection that the vocabulary\nof the new psychology owed much to Myers ; amongst his best-known\ncoinages were telepathy, subliminal, and supernormal.\nMr. Podmore then spoke of Frederic Myers' firm conviction of a\nfuture life, and of his complete happiness in that belief. He had\nwritten to the speaker announcing the near coming of the end, and\nspoke of himself as one waiting to be summoned home.\nThe President then announced that two or three communications had\nbeen received from other friends, which time would not admit of being\nread in full that evening. All these would however appear, together\nwith the papers already read, in a forthcoming number of the\nProceedings. A letter was read from Professor Barrett in which he\n\f58 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [APRIL, 1901\nsaid, \" I shall be glad if the Chairman will express how much I regret\nbeing unable to be present at this meeting, and how heartily I join in\nthe tributes which will be given to the memory of our late President\nand dear friend, whose loss we so deeply deplore. \"\nMr. C. C. Massey then said a few words. He Jiad been one of\nthose who had known Mr. Myers in the days before the Society was\nfounded, and afterwards he had worked with him for some years at the\ntask of collecting and appraising the evidence afterwards published in\nPhantasms of the Living, and in the Society's Proceedings. He had had\nthe best opportunities of recognizing and admiring Myers' rich intellec\ntual endowment, his high character, and profound spiritual insight.\nTHE MEMORIAL, OF WHICH A COPY IS FEINTED BELOW,\nWAS FORWARDED TO LORD RAYLEIGH ON THE\n18TH FEBRUARY.\nTo LORD RAYLEIGH.\nWe, the undersigned members of the Council of the Society for\nPsychical Research, individually and collectively beg to approach your\nLordship with the petition that you will consent to take up the\nPresidency of our Society, vacant by the death of F. W. H. Myers.\nThe Society, started nineteen years ago under the Presidency of\nHenry Sidgwick, has loyally and faithfully begun the work for which\nit was called into being, and has achieved some measure of success in\ninvestigating the difficult and neglected field of ultra-normal mental\npowers. We claim that its labours, if they have not yet established\nbeyond controversy the fact of telepathy, have accumulated in its\nfavour evidence difficult to controvert and impossible to ignore, and\nhave thrown much light on the workings of sub-conscious intelligence\ngenerally ; we see avenues opening into other and connected regions\nof discovery, and we are impressed with the importance of the know\nledge that may thus be gained. We think it would be a blow to true\nscience if the quest were in any sense weakened at the present stage,\nwhen we are nearer than ever before to a hope that the subject-matter\nof our researches may be recognised by long-established scientific\nsocieties, and be incorporated with the main streams of substantial\nhuman knowledge and inquiry.\nBut the deaths of Sidgwick and Myers, within a few months of\neach other, have left us without a leader, and lamentably weakened\nus even as workers. Yet there are some of us who have hoped that\nan ultimate outcome of our research might be a scientific proof of the\n\fAPRIL, 1901.] Memorial to Lord Rayleigh 59\ncontinuity of individual intelligence and memory across the psychical\nevent called death, of whose psychological significance Science is at\npresent uncertain. On lower grounds, however, we feel that so great\na calamity as their loss should weld together and strengthen those that\nremain, and may justifiably call for some measure of self-sacrifice on\ntheir part in order to continue as well as they can the work so\nlaboriously and powerfully initiated by those who have gone.\nWe know, some of us know very well, how arduous and how\nabsorbing is the work to which you have set yourself. We know also\nthat some of it is work which no other man can do, and we should\nbe utterly unjustified in seeking to persuade you to withdraw your\nattention from any part of it. We know further that you are assisting\nthe Government in various ways, and that this public service must\nalready consume some of your too valuable time.\nYet we cannot refrain from urging upon you, in the strongest\nmanner, that here and now in connection with Psychical Research it\nlies in your power to do a service to the science of the future which no\none else can render. We do not ask you to give any considerable\namount of time or energy to the work, as we have ascertained that\nOliver Lodge is willing to act as your Deputy, but we ask you to lend\nus the high scientific authority of your name, we ask you for counsel\nand guidance ; and we feel that we shall then have secured something\nwhich will go far to balance our recent heavy losses, and will help us\nto keep the Society at the level it has already attained, or perhaps to\nraise it above that level.\nIf you consent we will do our utmost .to avoid encroaching on your\ntime, and will seek each in his own way to maintain so far as we are\nable, in the spirit of our lost leaders, the essentially scientific reputation\nof our Society for candour, care, and caution.\nFebruary 14th, 1901.\nThe following authorised their signatures to be appended to the above\nMemorial :\u2014\nTHE RT.

II.\n( Continued from the March Journal. )\nOf hardly less value than the study of supernormal faculties\u2014and\nindeed indispensable for any just appraisement of them\u2014is the study of\noccasional heightenings of the normal faculties\u2014the various hyperees-\nthesise of the senses, of the interpretation of sensations, or of memory.\n\" Hypersesthesia,\" says Mr. Myers in an article in Proceedings, S.P.R.,\nvol. xi., p. 410), \"may be peripheral or central\u2014that is to say, it may\nconsist in the heightened perception of sensations coming from outside\nour organism, or from within the brain.\" He proceeds to give \" some\ncases of apparent telsesthesia, or of apparent prevision, which may\npossibly, though by no means certainly, be referable to an extension of\nthe external senses.\" Thus, Mr. P. H. Newnham hears an internal\nvoice saying to him, \" You'll find Chaonia [a certain rare moth] on that\noak \" ; walks up to the oak and finds it. A geologist has a sudden\nmental vision of a peculiar variety of fern just before coming across it.\nAn engine-driver has a sudden impulse to stop his train just in time to\nprevent a collision. All these are cases which may have depended on\nsubconscious interpretations of very slight visual or auditory sensations,\nand in which \" subliminal perception may have been slightly quicker\nand more delicate than supraliminal.\"\nThe following are cases of a similar kind\u2014probably explicable in the\nsame way\u2014that have recently been sent to us by Mr. Gilbert Murray,\nex-Professor of Greek in the University of Glasgow. The third incident,\nthough obviously on a different footing from the others, is perhaps\nworth mentioning in connection with them. The account was contained\nin a letter to Mrs. Verrall, dated January 17th, 1901, as follows :\u2014\n. . . Yesterday afternoon, about 3.30, I was waiting in the garden to take\nDenis for a walk, and passed the time in going as high as I could on a\nswing. Suddenly I felt convinced that the swing would break. Then (1) I\nreflected that if it broke while I was going forward I must jump so as\nto avoid a certain clump of roses trained round thick stumps, while if it\nbroke when I was going backwards and threw me over a bank that there\nwas, I felt uncertain what would be best to do. (2) I thought that after all\nit was practically certain that both ropes would not break together, and that\nI could hold tight to the sound one. (3) I said to myself half-aloud, \" Aged\nman, are you getting nervous ? \" and worked myself a little higher. Then\none rope broke ; I clung to the other and was swung away backwards with a\nwrench and came down unhurt. I also remember feeling\u2014after my first\nmisgiving\u2014that at any rate there was not the slightest symptom of the rope\n\f62 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [APRIL, 1901.\nor branch being in any way weak or wrong. I paid attention to this,\nof course.\nI think the probable explanation is that I was influenced by some uncon\nscious observation of odd behaviour on the part of the rope. But it\nwas entirely unconscious, and not even discernible when I paid attention\nto it.\nThis recalls another funny thing of the same sort. Several months ago,\nwhile coming down stairs, I looked at a hanging lamp that we have in the\nhall. It hung by a brass chain. I thought, \" I wonder if that chain is\nholding all right.\" Instead of going straight to the drawing-room, whither I\nwas bound, I turned aside to the lamp, reached up and felt it underneath,\njust relieving the weight and letting it sink again. The chain broke, and\nthe lamp came off in my hands. The globe was broken in falling, but\nnothing more.\nFor a \" third libation,\" of a very small sort, I think you have told me that\nyou have heard flies walking. I heard one perfectly distinctly the other day\nwalking rather noisily on crisp tracing-paper ! I was tracing costumes from\na vase-book for Andromache. I doubt if this was hyperassthesia at all ; I\nthink any one could have heard him. . . .\nGILBERT MURRAY.\n\fAPRIL, 1901.] 63\nStatement of Accounts.\n\u2022 CO O ^* tO N O CD O O CO O CD O CD CO CS Cs\nT3 ~ ' r-. \" .- I\niC \u2022 CO O OS CO 5Q CO \u20ac\"\u2022- O O t\u2014 O O 'O lf\u00a3 O CD t- eo\nel^\n'_\u2022 \"i-H rH i\u2014IT-HI-HI\u2014t rH i-H t-\n^[^ c\u00a3t ^ j2 \"* Sr .*' ^ ccicicict\u2014 wc^-^ccco c\n^H \u2022* F-H ' \" ' i-\nQi _j o CD to co *H\nS\n) lg>^\n.,\nountant.\n4\nr-T 0 u-C\negg\nill\nCq * - - r-' 1\u00bb a * tjo g| \u00a7\u2022 S S\nJ5 ... ; ; \u20220 \u20220 ^ -^ ; ; \u00abg ; g ; ; & = \u2014 w55\no\no\nCO\n0\ng 1\n* %\n% 8\nH\n<^\n\u00bb3\nhq\ng\nO\nH-H\nS\nM\n0 5i\nCO QJ\nCM O\nO ^\nfa fej\nto\nH\nO\nt^\ng\nEN\nI\n^\nftn\nN\n\u00bb.&sw& S S S b\n; ; . .

LODGE briefly introduced to the meeting the reader of the\npaper, Dr. F. van Eeden of Bussum, Holland. DR. VAN EEDEN,\nwho spoke throughout in correct and fluent English, then read an\naccount of some sittings with Mrs. Thompson. He began by pointing\nout that those who accepted psychical phenomena as genuine in the\nmain were divided into two parties, the spiritualists and the non-\nspiritualists, both parties including many persons of intellectual dis\ntinction. The first theory, the speaker held, was much the simpler.\nIt was the more directly suggested by the facts, and it afforded a\ncomplete explanation of them. Nor was there anything intrinsically\nabsurd, or even improbable, in the hypothesis of spirit agency ; on the\ncontrary, it seemed philosophically probable that there were many\ngrades of existence above our own, and that man's senses were far\nfrom providing the measure of the universe. God's Infinity, as\nSpinoza said, is expressed in an infinite number of ways.\nOn the other hand, the principle of scientific parsimony required\nthat we should not postulate new causes until we had exhausted the\npossibilities of those which we know, and the non-spiritualist party\nclaimed that we must not assume spirits until we can prove that\ntelepathy cannot furnish an adequate explanation of the facts.\nDr. van Eeden then gave a few illustrations of the facts communi\ncated to him at his own sittings with Mrs. Thompson, which were\n\f68 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAY, 1901.\nsufficient at any rate to convince him that knowledge of his private\naffairs was shown beyond what fraud or chance or successful guessing\ncould explain. At the first sitting, though strict precautions had been\ntaken to conceal his name and nationality, his Christian name was\ngiven, an allusion made to his profession, and a recognisable attempt\nwas made to pronounce his surname.\nLater his full name was given, the names of his wife and one of his\nchildren, and his residence. Again, he brought to Mrs. Thompson two\narticles, a lock of hair and a piece of clothing. The first was identified\ncorrectly, as the hair of a man who had lived and died in Utrecht.\nThe latter had been cut from the clothes of a suicide ; an exact\ndescription was furnished of the young man, and of the manner of his\ndeath, and even his familiar name was given. At some sittings facts\nwere given which were not within the speaker's knowledge, and were\nafterwards verified. None of these things, however, aiforded, as Dr.\nvan Eeden pointed out, crucial proof of spirit identity. No such proof\nwas possible until we had learnt more of the limits and possibilities\nof telepathy and clairvoyance. Nor on the other hand are we justified\nin inferring from mistakes and inconsistencies that the soi-disant spirit\npersonalities are necessarily fictitious. Dr van Eeden had himself felt\nat one or two sittings a profound conviction that he was in actual\ncommunication with the spirit of a deceased friend. On the other\nhand his own observations had led him to doubt the existence of the\nso-called controlling spirits. In his view these pseudo-personalities\nwere probably artificial productions created by the medium's sub\nconscious imagination ; and for these creations the credulity, the want\nof caution, and generally the over-eagerness of the sitters, were mainly\nresponsible.\nAfter giving an account of some interesting and successful dream\nexperiments, in which he himself acted as agent and Mrs. Thompson\nas percipient, Dr. van Eeden concluded by pointing out the special\ndanger attending this investigation ; the danger that enquirers through\nover-zeal should impose their views upon the medium and receive\nback from her mind merely the echo of their own desires and specu\nlations. In no kind of science was there more need of patience,\nprudence, and, as far as might be, an attitude of passive acceptance.\nThe PRESIDENT found himself in entire agreement with Dr. van\nEeden's claim that the world of conscious existence need not be\nbounded by the human race. We know, he pointed out, the inhabitants\nonly of one small lump of matter, but the universe contained similar\nlumps in infinite variety and with infinite possibilities of existence.\n\fMAY, 1901.] General Meeting. 69\nDr. Lodge went on to speak of the admirable caution, and not less\nadmirable frankness, shown by Dr. van Eeden. He had himself\nlistened with interest and sympathy as Dr. van Eeden had described his\noscillations of opinion as the phenomena gradually developed themselves.\nDr. Lodge gave a recent case analogous to some of those quoted by Dr.\nvan Eeden ; a medium in Liverpool, who had been investigated by an\nAssociate of the Society, had been enabled, when a handkerchief was\npresented, to give a full and accurate account of its owner, a man who\nhad been lately the victim of a serious mining accident.\nDR. LODGE concluded by expressing the view that the ultimate\nexplanation of these trance utterances would prove to be more com\nplicated than we at present realise. If through these utterances we can\nget into communication with spirits, we are forced to recognise that it\nis not the man as we know him in life ; we tap apparently by this\nmeans only a fraction of a personality. Probably Myers' researches\nin the subliminal Self would prove ultimately of great value in eluci\ndating the mystery.\nMRS. VERRALL, at whose house in Cambridge some of Dr. van\nEeden's sittings with Mrs. Thompson had taken place, bore testimony\nto the fact that Dr. van Eeden was a most cautious and reticent sitter,\nfrom whose talk and demeanour Mrs. Thompson's subliminal Self could\nhave received little help.\nDR. WALLACE, MR. PIDDINGTON, MR. MONTAGU E. CRACKAN-\nTHORPE and others spoke, the discussion being chiefly concerned with\nthe dreams referred to and with the ability shown by Mrs. Thompson\nin the trance to understand Dutch and even to speak a few words of\nthat language.\nAN UNFULFILLED PRESENTIMENT.\nTHE following case is recorded by Mr. Leonard Huxley in the Life and\nLetters of Thomas Henry Huxley (Macmillan, 1900). In the autumn of\n1888 Huxley had gone abroad for his health. He had been much run\ndown when he started, but was at the time of the \"presentiment\"\ndecidedly better :\nA curious incident in this journey deserves recording as an instance of a\nfutile \"warning.\" On the night of October 6-7 [1888] Huxley woke in the\nnight and seemed to hear an inward voice say, \" Don't go to Stuttgart and\nNxireniberg ; go straight home.\" All he did was to make a note of the\noccurrence and carry out his original plan, whereupon nothing happened\n(Vol. II. p. 205).\n\f70 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAY, 1901.\nNOTE ON SOME AUTOMATIC MESSAGES.\nBY M. PETROVO-SOLOVOVO,\nHonorary Secretary of the S.P.JR. for Russia.\nLAST year a friend M. C. [assumed initial] and myself made some\nexperiments in automatic writing (by means of a saucer with pointer\nmoving over a sheet of paper with the letters of the alphabet) with\nsome curious results.\nWe obtained a series of messages purporting to proceed from a\ncertain M. Mainoff\u2014a. Russian writer of some repute, who died in\n1888; and some of these messages contained facts which, though not\nconsciously known to us, were verified and proved to be correct.\nMany other statements could not be verified, and some appear to be\naltogether false. But, be this as it may, the nature of some of\nthe \" veridical \" messages was such as to completely exclude the\npossibility of chance-coincidence ; and the only possible explanation\nappears to me to be either hypersesthesia of memory (coupled\nwith personation) or the hypothesis of the external origin of the\nmessages.\nAt one time I was somewhat inclined to adopt the latter hypothesis ;\nbut as other \" messages \" proceeding apparently from the same source\ncontained facts which appeared to be false ; and as, on the other hand,\nhypersesthesia of memory as a possible explanation could not be\naltogether excluded (with one doubtful exception) from any of the\nveridical cases,\u2014I feel compelled to adopt it provisionally as explaining\nthem all, with a dim hope (a very dim one !) that future experiments\nmay still point to another solution.\nI shall now proceed to the experiments themselves.\nAt our very first seance (on June 27th, 1900, my wife only being\npresent, besides M. C. and myself, and taking notes), the saucer began\nto move very slowly and after spelling out a few words and names\nit wrote : \" Tchabany, we [are] Tchdbany.\" Neither my wife, nor M. C.,\nnor I knew such a word. We asked about the language ; answer :\n\" Yours.\" Then it was written : \" Southern.\" Then a name was\ngiven (with mistakes in spelling), which I did not recognise, but which\nC. found to be \"Maxim Gorki,\" the pseudonym of a rising Russian\nnovelist.\nFurther enquiries elicited the facts that we could find information\nabout \" Tchabany \" in Gorki's tales,1 which were strongly recommended\n1 Or perhaps that a tale of Gorki's is called so\u2014this is not quite clear to me ; but if so,\nthis is incorrect, so far at least as his works already printed are concerned.\n\fMAY, 1901.] Note on some Automatic Messages. 71\nto us as \"priceless, good\"; and the name \"Tchelkash\" was also given\nas the title of a tale.\nWe then asked who was speaking. Answer (not at once) ; \"Mainoff.\"\n\"He\" then explained that \"he had died long ago\"; then came the\nwords : \"Gorki\u2014good\u2014tale\u2014there [you] will find.\"\nWe then asked \" him \" for more information about himself, and\n\"Mainoff\" made in this connection the following statements:\n(1) That he \"had written much about Russia, Finland, Karelia\n(south-eastern part of Finland).\"\n(2) That his Christian name was \" Volodia \" (Russian pet name for\nVladimir); and that he \"did not remember [his] wife.\"\n(3) That he died 10 years ago, \" but suffered more \" ; (as a fact he died\nin 1888, as stated).\n(4) That his address in S. Petersburg was \"Peski, 8th street\"\n(corrected at another seance to \" Peski, 4th street, No. 8 \" ; \" Peski \"\nis, or rather was, the name of a quarter in S. Petersburg). He did not\nremember (litt. : \" see \") his address (litt. : \" street \") in Helsingfors.\n(5) In answer to the question where information about himself could\nbe obtained, the words : \" Hel[singfors] \" and \" Gymnasium \" were\nspelt out.\nHere the s6ance ended. It should be mentioned :\n(1) That the existence of a Russian author named Mainoff was totally\nunknown (at least consciously) both to C. and to my wife (who did not\ntouch the saucer, besides). As for myself, I remembered him -only as\nthe author of a \" Guide Book \" to Finland, which I very probably had\nseen. Consciously I did not know\u2014or remember\u2014anything else about\nhim. (I may add here that the author's name on a copy of his \" Guide\nBook \" I bought since the seance is printed as V. Mainoff\u2014no Christian\nname being given in full).\n(2) That neither C. (who had read some of Gorki's works), nor my\nwife, nor I knew of the existence of a tale of his called \"Tchelkash\";\nnor did we know such a word as \"Tchabany \" (plural of \"Tchaban \").\nOn the very next day, however, I learnt that the word \" Tchaban \" is\ncommonly used in South Russia with the meaning of shepherd ; and\non buying vol. I. of Gorki's tales I found \" Tchelkash \" among them.\n\"Tchabans\" are besides mentioned and described more than once\nin his other tales.\nOn the other hand on referring to the Brockhaus-Effront Russian\nEncyclopaedia I found that Mainoff was the author of a great many\nworks besides his \" Guide Book,\" chiefly on anthropology, one of them\nbeing entitled \" A Journey in Onega-land and Karelia.\" I also found\n\f72 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAY, 1901.\nthat his Christian name was Vladimir, and that he had been for four years\n(1882-1886) teacher at the Alexander \" Gymnasium \" in Helsingfors. (I\nhave also a letter in my possession signed by one of the officials of the\n\"Gymnasium\" certifying the fact.)\nI shall speak with regard to the address later on.\n\" Mainoff\" manifested at further se'ances, literally overwhelming us\nwith facts\u2014for which we were perpetually clamouring\u2014which it was,\nhowever, very hard to verify. Many could not be in spite of many\nendeavours. Others were undoubtedly false with regard to the present\ntime (such as addresses given at Cannes and Moscow which were\nverified and proved to be false), though they may not have been so\n15 or 20 years ago (?). And at least one statement, and a very\nimportant one\u2014about Mainoff's children\u2014seems to have been false\naltogether. One statement, however, proved to be true, and a very\ncurious one. At our third sitting, in answer to a request for verifiable\nfacts1 \"Mainoff\" gave us the following: He had attended at one time\nPaul Broca's lectures. Now neither C. nor I had any idea of this fact ;\nhowever, it proved to be true on verification. A gentleman who replied\nto an advertisement I caused to be inserted in a newspaper got for me\nthe confirmation of this fact from one of Mainoff's sons, now in Canada.\nThis circumstance impressed me a good deal ; and I considered it at the\ntime as strongly suggestive of an external origin.\nHowever, il a fallu en rabattre. But first, I must say a few words\nabout the other \" veridical \" messages. It is obvious that none of them\nwas of such a character as to exclude its explanation by \" latent\nmemory.\" The word \" Tchaban,\" though forgotten by us, may very\npossibly have been known both to C. and to myself. Ditto the\nexistence of a tale of Gorki's called Tchelkash. In the volume I bought\nafter our first sitting this name and several others are printed on the\ncover ; the conclusion is obvious. The statements about Mainoff given\nin the same sittings are given in several obituary notices of him I have\nseen ; and so may have been known to us and forgotten.\nI regret to say that the \" Broca incident \" proved no exception to\nthis rule, and that I soon managed to find out in the number of the\nNovoe Fremia newspaper mentioning Mainoff's death on February\n23rd (March 6th), 1888, a short notice of him in which the fact of his\nhaving attended Broca's (without the Christian name) lectures was\nduly mentioned. Now the Novoe Fremia is the most widely circulated\nI 1 have not unfortunately in my possession the notes of this seance ; but I feel pretty\ncertain that it was in answer to a demand for test-facts that the information about Broca\nwas given us ; and at any rate we constantly asked for \" tests.\"\n\fMAY, 1901.] Note on some Automatic Messages. 73\nof Russian daily papers ; and it is very probable that this passage\ndid fall under our eyes more than 12 years ago. Broca's Christian\nname \"Paul\" is not, it is true, given in the number of the Novoe\nVremia referred to ; but then again it must have been known to\nus once (and I even think C. knew it at the time).\nTo prove that hyperaesthesia of memory is insufficient as an\nexplanation of the Broca incident, we must surely have some other\n\" veridical \" statements of such a character as to exclude it altogether.\nUnfortunately no such statements have as yet been forthcoming.\nThere may be some among the many that could not be verified ; but if\nso, it is to be specially regretted that of those which were verified none\nreached the standard required.\n\" MainofFs \" address as given at the first (and corrected at the third)\nsitting at one time made me hope that in it would I find the proof\nrequired ; but these expectations were not fulfilled. The fact of his\nhaving once lived at Peski (I should rather say \"in the Peskis,\" for\n\" Peski \" literally means \" sands \") was, it is true, confirmed by his son\n(now in America) in a letter sent to a gentleman who kindly con\nsented to act as intermediary between him and me; but he did not\nremember the precise address. Still this partial confirmation looked\nencouraging ; and I therefore made strenuous and numerous efforts to\nlearn the exact address, almost every conceivable track being followed\n\u2014but, alas, without success.\nI ought to mention, however, that in an answer I received from the\nParis SocieU d'Anthropologie, of which Mainoff was a member, neither of\nthe two addresses given is in accordance with that mentioned in the\n\" message \" ; nor does it agree with the one given in the announcement\nof Mainoff's death as printed in the Novosti newspaper, nor with such\nwell-known facts as Mainoff having been a teacher at Helsingfors\nbetween 1882 and 1886. The mystery therefore remains unsolved.\nThere is no connection, it should be finally stated, between Mainoff\nand Gorki's works (which, by the way, a friend had strongly recom\nmended me to read a few days before the first se'ance, without,\nhowever, mentioning by name either \"Tchelkash\" or \"Tchaban\").\nAll of them were printed, and, I think, written a few years after\nMainofFs death. But more than this;\u2014at our last seance \"Mainoff\"\npositively stated that the \"Gorki\" part of the \"communications\" did\nnot proceed from himself. \" It is not my will which inspires[d i] [them],\nbut a will-less consciousness [sic !].\" He did not, however, explain to\nour satisfaction how it was that in those messages also facts were\nmentioned of which we had no conscious knowledge.\n\f74 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAY, 1901\nIt is much to be regretted that many of the facts stated by\n\"Mainoff\" could not be verified in spite of many endeavours, and\nuntil they are\u2014though I have lost almost all hope of this !\u2014no\ndefinitive conclusion ought to be arrived at ; but as a somewhat\nprovisional statement the present account and discussion seem to me to\ncorrespond pretty closely with what actually occurred.\nIt will be admitted on all hands, I think, that the whole incident is\ncurious. To me in particular it is most suggestive as proving at the\nvery least that a sentence printed twelve years since, and once seen\n(if seen at all ?) may, when totally forgotten consciously, be reproduced\nautomatically, coupled with personation of a deceased human being, and\nsupplemented by other facts supplied undoubtedly by our memory\n(Paid Broca). Be the precise explanation of this case what it may\u2014\nand, of course, I am not absolutely certain that \" latent memory \" in\nsuch a form is in fact the correct explanation !\u2014spiritualists of bygone\ndays were surely pardonable to adopt the \" spirit hypothesis \" in face\nof such puzzling incidents.\nI may also mention that several \" clairvoyant \" experiments were\nmade with the soi-disant Mainoff, which invariably failed.\n[Mr. Solovovo sends us the following notes in corroboration of his\nnarrative from Mrs. Solovovo and Mr. C. The name of this gentleman\nhas been given us in confidence. \u2014ED.]\nJanuary 24th, February 6th [1901].\nI certify that, as related by my husband, I had no idea before the seances\nof either the existence of Mainoff, or of Gorki's tale, \"Tchelkash,\" or the\nword \"Tchaban.\" B.

I\ncan only hope that they were either misreported in the April Journal^\nor that their context actually mitigated the impression they leave in\ncold print.\n\fMAY, 1901.] Correspondence. 75\nDr. Lodge is reported to have said that the Society must not be\npermitted to disband and scatter until its work was done. Does he then\ncontemplate the possibility either that the Society may disband or that\nits work may be conceived soon to be done? The first of these\nalternatives we need not, I hope, at present discuss, but I have great\ndifficultj' in supposing how even the second could be seriously\nadvocated in the Society. How can we conceive our work ever to\nbe finished, except by sheer failure, the apprehension of which may\nnow surely be dismissed from our minds. There can no longer be any\ndoubt about the success of the Society, but only about the exact\ncharacter and ultimate bearing of the additions it has made to know\nledge: Even our most hostile critics among the professional\npsychologists, with whom we should be so glad to co-operate if only\nthey could overcome their natural suspicion and jealousy, are reluc\ntantly compelled to acknowledge this and to appeal to our researches.1\nThe original purpose therefore of the Society, to throw light upon the\ndark corners of human psychology, has been successfully accomplished\nto a far larger extent than its founders could reasonably have\nanticipated. But success can, and must, only multiply our labours,\nand to suppose that its success could become a pretext for its\ndissolution, would at once lower the Society to the level of organisa\ntions like the Liberation Society or the Cobden Club, who must\n(formerly at least) have entertained real apprehensions lest they should\ncommit the happy despatch by the excess of their success.\nBut the S.P.R.'s work is surely different. Supposing we took the\nmost sanguine view of its possible achievements in the direction which\nis popularly supposed to absorb its whole energies, but which is\ncertainly not its only useful and legitimate branch of research. Suppose\nwe assumed that within the next few years it collected adequate and\nindefeasible evidence of man's survival of death. What then ? Surely\nthis gigantic achievement would not in any truly scientific society be\nthe prelude to its dissolution, but rather to a new and unequalled\noutburst of activity. We should then perhaps get some appreciable\nportion of humanity to care what happened to them after death. We\nshould be rendered intensely curious about the conditions of the\nfuture life whose reality we should at length have succeeded in\nestablishing. And we should have a vast and fruitful field of labour\nbefore us in improving and assuring the means of communication\n1 This is particularly noticeable in the latest production hailing from this\nquarter\u2014Prof. Jastrow's Fact and Fable in Psychology\u2014in which the \" Facts \" are\ncertainly not Prof. Jastrow's own.\n\f76 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAY, 1901.\nbetween this life and the next. In short our work would in reality\nonly be begun. I am sure that no one who really regards the S.P.R.\nas a scientific society, and least of all Dr. Lodge, can take any very\ndifferent view of the prospects and future work of the Society.\nThis point leads me on to another, which I feel also has a consider\nable bearing on the future of the Society. As one sorrows to see the\nfounders and leaders, who have conducted its policy so far and nursed\nit patiently through the perils of its infancy, passing one by one over\nto the majority, it is impossible not to ask the question\u2014Is the Society\nsuccessful in gathering fresh recruits and replacing its lost leaders ? And\nagain\u2014Is it as successful as it might be in enlisting the co-operation of the\nrank and file of its members 1 Now while I should be the very last to\ntarnish with the slightest breath of disparagement the services of the\nSociety's present officers, I find it not altogether easy to suppress\nmisgivings on both these points. Our officers are able men, self-\nsacrificing men, but they are also busy men, in some cases extremely\nbusy men. They cannot give their whole time and energy to the\nSociety's work.\nHence the thought suggests itself whether the Society should not\naim at safeguarding its future by training up one or more expert\ninvestigators to conduct its work. Its position, both scientifically and\nfinancially, is now assured enough to justify men (or women) of ability\nin looking forward to making Psychical Research the scientific study of\ntheir life, and interest in the subject has never been lacking. Can we\nnot, then, make the Assistant Secretaryship of the S.P.R. a position for\na professional, trained expert ? In other words, can we not duplicate,\nor rather multiply, Dr. Hodgson ?\nThe question seems to me to be a purely financial one. The only\nanswer can be, that this would be an excellent plan if the funds were\nforthcoming.\nAnd this brings me to my last point. I understand that at the\nmeeting whose proceedings have suggested these reflections many\neloquent papers were read in honour of Mr. Myers. Mr. Myers himself,\nsimilarly, paid an exquisite tribute to the memory of Prof. Sidgwick.\nThese are fair words, but words are not enough wherewith to honour\nsuch strenuous workers. And where are the deeds ? Would it not\nbe better and more useful if we made an attempt to provide for the\npermanence of the Society which Messrs. Sidgwick and Myers helped\nto found, by securing a permanent endowment for a work which\nmust needs (humanly speaking) be permanent ?\nFor this purpose money will be needed, and needed in very con\n\fMAY, 1901.] Correspondence. 77\nsiderable sums. Able young men cannot be obtained unless the Society\noffers the prospect of an interesting and permanent career. And, again,\nas our President pointed out some time ago, the equipment of modern\nscientific research has become a very expensive thing. Men are the\nprimary requisite, but no one who seriously considers the future of\nPsychical Research can doubt that eventually laboratories with costly\napparatus will become necessary.\nBut how is this money to be found 1 I should answer, by asking for\nit, in the first place, strenuously and persistently. I have no doubt that\na considerable sum might, in spite of war and bad times, be raised from\nour present members. A college tutor is not an overpaid person, but I\nshould myself be glad to contribute \u00a310 to such a fund.\nAnd, secondly, the membership of the Society is surely capable of\nconsiderable enlargement. There must be more than 800 persons in\nthe country who can be induced to take an annual guinea's worth of\ninterest in a question which will in a few years' time dwarf all others\nfor them personally. I should estimate the real number as nearer 8000.\nAnd it would be part of the duty of an Organizing Secretary, such as I\nfeel the Society must have (sooner rather than later), to find out these\npersons and to get them to join. If they did, the financial difficulty\nwould solve itself by the natural growth of the Society.\nIn any case I feel that the time has come for action, and hope that\nthis letter may do something to forward it, or at least elicit expressions\nof opinion from others, and remain, yours sincerely,\nF.

With regard to a prophecy made by Mme.\nZuleika to a lady visiting her, and called in the narrative \" Veritas,\"\nit was said (p. 40), \"It was not unlikely . . . that Mme. Zuleika\nshould imagine that the husband of ' Veritas ' was going to South\n\f78 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAY, 1901.\nAfrica.\" It would have been better to say, \"It was not highly\nimprobable that Mme. Zuleika should imagine that a relative or friend\nof ' Veritas' . . .\" To justify the remark, even in this modified form,\nit must be borne in mind that the most common reason for visiting\nmediums probably is that the visitor is in some kind of trouble at the\ntime. (Thus, in this case, \" Veritas \" thought it probable\u2014she tells us\n\u2014that her husband was going to South Africa, which would naturally\nhave caused her some anxiety, though it was not this that consciously\nled to her visit.) In February, 1900, there were probably in England\nmore persons in anxiety on account of friends or relatives going out to\nthe war than on account of any other single cause. Consequently no\ngreat weight must be attached to the mere fact that Mme. Zuleika\nassociated Mrs. V.'s visit with a present or future interest in the fate\nof a relative at or going to the war. We learnt, in fact, incidentally\na few days ago that during the past year Mme. Zuleika had been\nconsulted by a very large number of persons about relatives and\nfriends at the war.\nThe intention, however, of the whole editorial paragraph (pp. 40-41)\nwas to weigh fairly the objections that might be urged against the\ngenuinely premonitory character of Mme. Zuleika's statements; the\ngeneral conclusion being that, though each statement considered alone\nmight be regarded as a mere guess, the cumulative force of the number\nof details corresponding to future events told strongly against such a\nview of all the statements put together.\nCASES.\nP. 272.\nLA TOUR DB PEILZ, VAUD, SWITZERLAND,\n14th March, 1901.\nHere is a case of premonitory dream.

Young, Llanelly.\nTHE following case is one of many similar impressions which Mr. J. F.\nYoung has had. The interest of this particular case consists in the\nfact that Mr. Young at once acted upon the suggestion made to him\nsome time previously by Professor Barrett, and at the moment of its\noccurrence wrote down the intimation with the date and hour.\nNEW ROAD, LLANELLY, March 9\/91.\nThe following account of a presentiment I recently had may be interesting\nto you.\nI was having my supper on the evening of February 15th last, when a\nmessage came from a customer requiring my services. I sent back a reply\nthat I would come immediately I had my supper. It has always been a\nstrong point with me to keep my appointments, and therefore, having\nhastily finished my meal, I was in the act of leaving the table when I\nsuddenly exclaimed, \" There ! ! ! I have just had an intimation that Robert\nis dead \" : the Robert referred to is a Robert Hallett (a brother-in-law) who\nwas residing near my sister (Mrs. Ponting) at Sturminster Newton, Dorset.\nHe had been bed-ridden from paralysis for this last two years, but had\nrecently been much worse.\nI at once entered full particulars in my diary. Date, Feb. 15. Message,\nand time of message, 9.40 P.M. My sister-in-law was present the whole\ntime, and can vouch for the circumstances. On the 17th I received a post\ncard from my sister at Sturminster Newton, bearing date Feb. 16th, stating,\nthat \" Robert had passed away, will write to-morrow.\"\nIn the meantime I had written to my sister Mrs. Ponting, mentioning my\npresentiment, and our letters crossed, for the following morning a letter came\nfrom her (I must mention here she had been assisting in nursing my\nbrother-in-law), saying, \"I was glad you had a presentiment of poor Robert's\nrelease, he passed away at 7.45 P.M., then Lottie [my niece Lottie Hallett]\n.and I came home till 9.J\/0, and that was the time you had the impression.\"\nI wish to state two facts in connection with the foregoing case. (1) I was\nnot thinking of him at the time, my mind being engrossed in my appoint\nment, and the impression came so startlingly sudden, which caused me to\nhastily say, There !!!... as before stated ; and (2) at the same moment,\nI had a sense of a presence at my left, so much so, that I looked sharply\nround, but found no one there.\nThis was my first and only impression during his long illness.\n\f80 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAY, 1901.\nIt will be observed that there is a difference of nearly two hours from the\ntime of his death to the premonition. Had his spirit only then recovered\nconsciousness, or was it a case of telepathy from my sister on her arrival\nto the quiet of her home, when her thoughts roamed to me ? I may say\nwe are devotedly attached to each other, and her psychical faculties are\nsimilar to my own. I have sent you post-card, envelope, and part of letter\nas evidence, and Mrs. Ponting (my sister) will give you every facility to\ncorroborate what I have written. J. F. YOUNG.\nThe sister-in-law referred to, Miss E. Bennett, has read the above\nstatement and appends the following :\n9th March, 1901.\nThe foregoing is quite correct. (Signed) E. BENNETT.\nThe note in the diary occurs amongst some memoranda on blank\nsheets at the end of a small pocket diary. The previous entry is dated\nFebruary 12th, and the two following entries are dated, in that order,\nFebruary 28 and February 19. The entry contains, therefore, no\ninternal evidence of having been written at the time. It is as follows :\nFeb. 15. As I rose from supper, a message came, as if by spirit influence,\nto say, \" Robert has passed away.\" Miss Bennett present. I said, \" There, I\nhave just had an intimation Robert is dead. Time, 9.40 P.M. Noted full\nparticulars on my return : was called away. Had to see a customer on\nbusiness.\"\nMr. Young's original letter to his sister, Mrs. Ponting, has, un\nfortunately, not been preserved. But we have seen a post-card from\nMrs. Ponting, dated February 1 6, containing the simple announcement :\n\" Passed away quietly last evening \" ; also two letters in which Mrs.\nPonting refers to Mr. Young's letter. In the first, dated February 19th,\nshe writes :\nI was glad to hear you had a presentiment of poor Robert's release. He\npassed away at a quarter to eight. Then Lottie [Hallett] and I came home\ntill 9.40, so that was the time you had the impression.\nIn the second letter Mrs. Ponting announces her unsuccessful search\nfor the missing letter from Mr. Young. It had probably been, as she\nexplained, torn up for pipe-lights.\nMiss Lottie Young, another niece, to whom Mr. Young related his\nimpression on the morning after its occurrence, sends us the following\ncorroboration :\n7 NEW ROAD, LLANELLY, April 11.\nAccidentally meeting my uncle, Mr. Young, on the morning of Feb. 16th,\nhe informed me that he had had an intimation the previous evening that\nMr. Hallett was dead. On Feb. 17th he showed me a post-card (received\nthat day), which stated that Mr. Hallett died on Feb. 15th, thus confirming\nthe intimation. L. YOUNG.\n\fNo. CLXXX.\u2014VOL. X.

Foxwell.\"\nDr. WALLACE began by stating that the elucidation of this mysterious\ncase had been unfortunately interrupted, but he considered that some\nof the incidents ought to be communicated to the Society. He\ndeprecated the attitude of some scientific leaders to psychic investiga\ntion, but recognized the necessity for special qualifications in those who\nundertook such investigations. As the basis and justification for his\naction in the Foxwell case, he read from his note-book three illustrative\ncases, one in which spontaneous telepathic communications were\nmanifested between two persons at a distance of seventy-one miles, the\nevidence being vouched for by himself and Mr. Colin E. Campbell,\na member of the Society, and by Mrs. Albert Barker and her niece.\nThe second case was one of retrocognition in which exact details\nwere given ; and the third was an example of prevision in which an\naccident to an express train and several details of injuries to passengers,\nwith the names of three of the dead, were described seven days previous\nto the occurrence.\nDr. WALLACE then related in detail the facts connected with the\ndisappearance of Mr. Foxwell, on 20th December last, as reported in\nthe newspapers. On the evening of 28th December, a clairvoyant,\nMr. Von Bourg, stated that he had \"a strong impression that the\n\fJUNE, 1901.] General Meeting. 83\ngentleman who has disappeared from Thames Ditton has met with\nfoul play, although they may make it appear to be a case of suicide.\"\nOn the 4th January he confirmed this impression, and gave some\nclairvoyant descriptions and predictions. He said that his gold watch\nand valuables were still on Mr. Foxwell's body, and that the body\nwould be found in the Thames within from 6 to 8 weeks, floating\nwith its face downwards opposite a water tower and works, lower down\nthe river than Thames Ditton. Dr. Wallace transcribed these and\nother details on a couple of post-cards, one to himself, bearing the post\nmark, London, W., 3.15 A.M., Jan. 5, 1901, and the other to the\nAssistant-Secretary, Mr. Bennett, bearing the post-mark of the morning\nof January 7th. By a strange coincidence, the wife of the missing man\nconsulted Mr. Von Bourg on 5th January, and saw in his crystal a\nriver scene with a human body therein, and also a water tower and\n.works. The medium asserted that this was her husband's body, and\nthat it would be found in such circumstances. This was actually veri\nfied in every detail on the 31st January, 26 days afterwards. The\n.details of two subsequent visits to the house of Mrs. Foxwell of a group\nof individuals, possessing psychic powers in various degrees, were given,\nand communications purporting to come from Mr. Foxwell were related.\nOn 30th January, following the indications given, the party went in\nsearch of the missing body, but owing to darkness had to desist. The\nnext day the body was found floating in the river Thames as described\na short way below the point where the search terminated.\nMR. PODMORE congratulated Dr. Wallace on the courage he had\nshewn in taking up an enquiry of this kind, and on his perseverance in\ncarrying it through. But the results of the enquiry were, as Dr.\nWallace had himself admitted, somewhat inconclusive. The clairvoy\nants consulted in the case, as was the wont of clairvoyants, had poured\nout copious information on the scenery, the personal appearance of the\ndead man, and other matters on which clairvoyance was not needed to\ngive correct information, but had not been conspicuously successful in\ntheir attempts to elucidate what was really unknown. The two main\nstatements, the points on which all the clairvoyants consulted had found\nthemselves in agreement, were that Mr. Foxwell had been murdered,\nand that the body had been thrown into the creek at a particular\npoint. Neither of these statements had been proved correct. The body\n.was found in the river, and there was no evidence that it had ever\nbeen in the creek ; and the post-mortem examination gave no countenance\nto the theory of violence.\nMR. PODMORE then passed on to consider the other illustrations of\n\f84 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JUNE, 1901.\nsupposed supernormal faculty adduced by Dr. Wallace. Professor\nSidgwick had, he pointed out, held up to us as an ideal the presentation\nof evidence in such a form that the alternative to accepting the facts\nalleged would be to accuse the witness of lying or of imbecility. The\nevidence brought forward by Dr. Wallace, in particular for the prophecy\nof the railway accident, seemed almost to fulfil this requirement. The\nevidence consisted of a shorthand note of the vision, written by Dr.\nWallace himself, and dated 5 days before the fulfilment. The record\nitself was so detailed as entirely to preclude explanation by chance-\ncoincidence. If the note was written on the day on which it purported\nto have been written, the conclusion\u2014that prevision of the future was\npossible\u2014could hardly be resisted.\nBut if Dr. Wallace was mistaken, and the written account was dated\nincorrectly, we were confronted with difficulties of another kind, in\nthemselves sufficiently serious.\nApart from & priori objections, the almost complete absence of trust\nworthy evidence for prevision forbade us to accept the first alternative ;\nand, on the whole, suspension of judgment in this particular case\nseemed the wisest course.\nMR. ROBERT KING, one of Dr. Wallace's colleagues in the investi\ngation, then gave some account of visions seen by himself in connection\nwith the case. He concluded by urging the importance of serious and\nsystematic investigation of the subject.\nMr. PiDDlNGTON asked whether a description of Mr. Foxwell's\npersonal appearance and of the trinkets worn on his watch-chain had\nappeared in notices circulated by the police, or in the newspapers.\nDR. WALLACE was unable to answer the question.\nDR. WALLACE, in replying to the criticisms offered, said that he had\ncarefully avoided supporting or denying the clairvoyant theory of foul\nplay, and had related the incidents of the investigation to the Society\nin order that each member might form his own deductions.\nDr. Wallace hinted the possibility of a continuance of his investi\ngation regarding the Foxwell case, owing to the receipt of some letters\nand documents which he proposed to submit to psychometric ex\nperiment.\nCORRECTION.\nMr. Solovovo asks us to correct a phrase in his account of \" Some\nAutomatic Messages,\" printed in the Journal for May.

W. H. Myers, has led to\nsome anxiety as to the future of the Society, and the Council desire\nto inform the members generally of the action taken and the plans\nformed in consequence and to appeal for their assistance to carry on\nwith undiminished energy the work of psychical research.\nThe Council have been informed that some members of the Society\n.have expressed a desire that a permanent memorial to Mr. Myers\nshould be founded ; but as it is known that he would have deprecated\nthe collection of funds for any personal memorial to himself, they are\nnot putting the present appeal forward in this form. It is clear,\nhowever, that in no way can his memory be more effectively perpetu\nated than by carrying on the work which owed so much to his self-\nsacrificing zeal and devotion, to which he gave so large a part of his\nlife and energy and which he regarded as of transcendent importance ;\nand the Council hope that those who desire to commemorate him will\nfeel that they have an opportunity of doing so in the way that would\nhave pleased him best by enabling the Society, which he did so much\nto foster and inspire, to carry on his work.\nThe first step taken by the Council after the death of Mr. Myers was\nto approach Lord Rayleigh, as one of the most distinguished living men\nof science in this or any other country, and ask him to accept the post\nof President. The memorial addressed to him, with the names of\nsignatories, will be found in the Journal for April, 1901.\nLord Rayleigh took some days to consider the matter; but, as it\nwas known that he had already declined a most important office by\nreason of press of scientific and other work, the Council could not\nbe very sanguine of his acceptance. It was encouraging, however,\nto find from his reply to the memorial that it was through no lack of\nsympathy with our aims and methods that he felt constrained to\ndecline the position. His reply was printed in the Journal for April,\np. 60.\nUnder these circumstances, the Council invited Dr. Oliver Lodge\nto undertake the office of President for the current year, and he\naccepted.\n\f86 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JUNB, 1901.\nBut it must be apparent to all that the loss of the active and devoted\nservices of F. W. H. Myers calls for special efforts from others, and it\nis desirable to consider carefully what can now be done to secure the\nenergetic continuance of the work of the Society.\nI.\nThe need for more workers.\nFirst, the Council desire to appeal to the members in general for\nactive aid and services. In the earlier stages of any scientific enquiry,\nwhilst the preliminary survey is still incomplete, and the aims and\nmethods of the investigation still mainly tentative, any intelligent and\nconscientious person can give valuable help by carefully observing and\nrecording facts and experiences, and can even undertake actual ex\nperimental work in several directions. The greater part of what has,\nalready been done in psychical research would, in fact, have been\nimpossible without the co-operation of a large number of individuals in\ngiving information and helping to furnish corroborative testimony.\nAll such co-operation the Council would welcome. Members becom\ning aware of any series of phenomena,\u2014whether spiritistic, telepathic,\netc.,\u2014going on in a private circle, are requested (if the persons,\nconcerned have no objection) to inform the Hon. Secretary of them,\nand to endeavour to obtain opportunities for their investigation by\nthe \"Committee for experiments.\"\nThe Council would also ask members themselves to complete as far as\npossible the evidence for any recent psychical occurrence or pheno\nmenon which they may hear of, with a view to sending to the Secretary\nnot merely unsupported narratives, but accounts accompanied by\nwhatever confirmatory documents or statements may be obtainable.\n(Many specimens of the kinds of corroborative evidence required\nare to be found among the numerous \" cases \" printed in the Journal.)\nIn the process of verification, flaws may often be discovered, and the\noriginal narrative may sometimes be found valueless as evidence, after\nmuch trouble has been expended on it. Such occasional disappoint\nments must, of course, be expected. They prove, in fact,\u2014as nothing\nelse could do,\u2014the necessity for investigation.\nFurther, those who collect information must not conclude that it is\nregarded as valueless if it does not soon appear in print in the Journal\nor elsewhere. Not only may it be necessary to delay the appearance\nof cases for want of space or because further corroboration is desirable,\nbut the final selection of what to print must be left in the hands of the\n\fJUNE, 1901.] Address and Appeal to the Members. 87\nCouncil, or of the officials to whom they may delegate this work.\nNarratives that are not selected for printing may often be useful as\nmaterial to some one who is making a special study of some branch of\nthe subject.\nIt is to be remembered that though it is always preferable to publish\nthe names of witnesses, as evidence of their good faith, any request not\nto publish names will be carefully attended to, so that informants need\nnot be deterred from relating experiences by any fear of publicity.\nThere is also a tendency to regard certain psychical experiences as\npeculiarly sacred and personal ; but hesitating informants may be\nreminded that, in addition to the personal aspect, their experiences,\nif genuine, are scientific facts also, and a service may be done to\nscience by the sacrifice of allowing them to be fully and accurately\nrecorded.\nMedical men, who sometimes hare opportunities of observing unusual\npsychical phenomena in connection with Hypnotism or otherwise,\nmight do useful service by reporting them.\nA more complete description of the kinds of work that could be\nundertaken by members is given in the last part of this circular; where\nalso, under the headings Literature, references are given to a few papers\nthat may be specially useful to students.\nII.\nThe need for more money.\nIn addition to more general co-operation on the part of members,\nthe Council think that further pecuniary help is needed, if the work\nachieved by Gurney, Sidgwick, and Myers (to mention only those who\nhave passed away) is to be continued on anything like the same scale,\nsince there is much more than can be adequately dealt with by the\npresent officials.\nTo meet this want, it has been suggested that, as a beginning, a\nthoroughly competent paid Organizing Secretary should be appointed,\nwho would be expected to devote all his time to the work. The salary\nattached to the post should be sufficient to attract a man of liberal\neducation and good abilities.\nIt is also felt that the present rooms of the Society are not sufficiently\naccessible to members for consultation or intercourse, and that it would\nbe an advantage to take larger and more convenient offices, where\nsmall meetings for informal discussion and experiments might be held,\n\f88 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JUNE, 1901.\nand to which members might arrange to bring subjects having any\nspecial psychic powers, who were willing to submit themselves to\ninvestigation.\nIt may doubtless have been thought that the Society had as much\nmoney as it needed ; but, apart from private munificence, this is un\nlikely ever to be the case. Hitherto some of the persons who have\ndone the greater part of the work have also given much money, and\nnow that important private sources of funds have been cut off, it\nbecomes necessary to appeal to the general body of members for\nhelp.\nThe Council trust that the intimation that pecuniary help is\nurgently required will be sufficient to evoke it, especially at the present\njuncture. They have no doubt that the work might expand greatly if\nfurther funds were forthcoming, and that the development of the\nsubject is hampered by lack of them ; for with funds they might be\nable to attract some trained observers to give to this subject the time\nand attention that are, comparatively speaking, so abundantly lavished\non other sciences. The amateur, as hinted above, can do one indis\npensable part of the work, namely, the collection of material ; but to\nmake the best use of the material, long training and wide experience\nand study of many branches of the subject are necessary. Sooner or\nlater, the professional element must enter into this, as into other\ndepartments of science, and the formation of an adequate endow\nment should be ultimately aimed at.\nBut without looking so far ahead, it is estimated that to carry out\nfully the proposals above mentioned, an additional yearly income of\nat least \u00a3500 would be required. This sum might be raised in various\nways :\n(1) By Associates (who pay an annual subscription of one guinea)\nbecoming Members (who pay an annual subscription of two guineas and\nacquire certain privileges thereby).\n(2) By extra voluntary annual subscriptions.\n(3) By donations.\n(4) By members securing the adhesion of new members.\n(5) By legacy (to secure the future of the Society).\nContributions may be sent to the Hon. Treasurer, H. ARTHUR\nSMITH, ESQ., 7, Queen's Mansions, Brook Green, London, W.\nThe question of investment of the sums received will depend on the\namount of response to this appeal.\n\f.JUNE, 1901.] Address and Appeal to the Members. 89\nIII.\nTypes of phenomena about which further information is desired.\nThese may be roughly classified under the following heads :\n(a) Automatic phenomena,\u2014e.g. crystal vision and automatic writing.\nMany persons after a little practice find that they can see in polished\nsurfaces pictures unconnected with the ideas consciously present to\nthem at the moment. Similarly, many persons are able to write\ncoherently (e.g. with a planchette, or simply by holding a pencil on a\npiece of paper while attending to something else), remaining uncon\nscious meanwhile of what they are writing. The majority of such\npictures or writings possess no more\u2014and no less\u2014significance than\nordinary dreams;\u2014they merely represent ideas in the automatist's\nsubliminal consciousness, of which his supraliminal self might have\nremained unaware but for this means of bringing them to the\nsurface.\nTheir interest increases when\u2014as sometimes happens\u2014they can be\ndefinitely recognised as revived memories of actual events which had\nbeen completely forgotten. This, also, sometimes happens in dreams.\nAgain, they may occasionally resemble the most interesting and\nrarest type of dreams, in conveying to the automatist information\nunknown to him by normal means.\nTo prove conclusively that such information has really been conveyed,\nit is of course necessary that the experience should have been fully\ndescribed in writing before any of the persons concerned knew whether\nit corresponded to actual facts or not ; and the original written account\nshould be preserved. This is necessary as evidence not so much of the\nwitness's good faith as of the accuracy of his memory, which may other\nwise be influenced by his subsequent knowledge of the event.\nIn carrying out the experiments, therefore, a complete dated record\nof all of them should be made at the time and kept for future\nreference. We can then see what proportion of them correspond with\nunknown events (and thereby test whether there is a greater amount\nof correspondence than can be attributed to chance), and also what\nevidence exists for the correspondence.\nLiterature.1\u2014\"The Subliminal Consciousness: Sensory Automatism\nand induced Hallucinations,\" by F. W. H. Myers (Proceedings S.P.R.,\n1 Under the heading Literature, only some of the most important papers on each\nsubject are mentioned.

Besides the experiments just mentioned,\nin which telepathic action is occasionally manifested, we may attempt\nthe method (inaugurated by the researches of Professor Barrett) of\ndirect thought-transference of simple and definite ideas between\npersons in a normal waking condition,\u2014the \"agent\" fixing his\nattention on some object or idea and endeavouring to make the\n\" percipient \" think of it, or see it in a crystal, or write it automatically\n(for it is sometimes found that these automatic methods are an aid to\nsuccess).\nIt must not be forgotten that much still remains to be done in order\nto establish even telepathy, beyond the possibility of dispute or cavil,\namong the facts universally recognised by science.\nFor the completest possible proof of telepathic phenomena, it is\nhighly important that experimental evidence should be increased, since it\nis only through well carried-out and varied experiments that we can\nhope to arrive at the laws which govern these phenomena. Contact\nbetween agent and percipient should be avoided, and the experiments,\nwhich are of most value are those with agent and percipient at a\nconsiderable distance from one another, of which so far we have only\na small number of cases.\nLiterature.\u2014Mr. M. Guthrie's \"Experiments in Thought-transference \"\n(Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. II., pp. 24-42). The articles of Professor and\nMrs. H. Sidgwick on their \" Experiments in Thought-transference \"\n(Proceedings S.P.R, Vol. VI., pp. 128-170; and Vol. VIII., pp. 536-\n596).\n(c) It is also very important that cases of spontaneous telepathy should\nbe recorded, communicated and enquired into as soon as possible after\nthey occur. Typical instances are phantasms or dreams coinciding\nwith deaths, or other important or well-defined events. The value\nof the evidence for these cases depends mainly on the experience\nhaving been recorded in writing shortly after its occurrence ; and\nthough evidence of the best quality is needed as much as it ever was,\nwe seem now to have arrived at the point where the further accumu\nlation of remote or second-hand evidence is useless.\nContemporaneous records are of course by far the most valuable ;\nbut it is also worth while to have records made not more than, say,\ntwo or three years after the occurrence. Records of telepathic or pre\nmonitory dreams are valuable only when the dream was noted or\n\fJUNE, 1901.] Address and Appeal to the Members. 91\ndescribed before the event to which it was supposed to correspond was\nknown.1\nLiterature.\u2014\"Phantasms of the Living.\" By E.

(In\nthe \" Contemporary Science Series.\" Walter Scott, London, 1894.)\n(d) Another important type is that of cases pointing to the\ncontinued existence of individuals after death, and to the possibility of\nreceiving communications from them;\u2014e.g. \"veridical\" phantasms of\nthe dead (those which in some way afford information of facts\nunknown to the percipient), or communications purporting to come\nfrom deceased persons through such means as automatic writing or\ntrance utterance, and likewise veridical in that they convey true infor\nmation unknown to the automatic writer or speaker. (The study of\nautomatism shows us that these phenomena cannot be taken as\nevidence of the agency of deceased persons unless they at least\ninclude some information of this kind.)\nLiterature.\u2014\" Phantasms of the Dead,\" by Mrs. H.

Cases of stone-throwing,\nbell-ringing, and movements of furniture, etc. (\" Poltergeists \"), in a\nparticular house, or in the neighbourhood of a particular person,\nseem to belong to this category.\n1 The reasons for requiring a higher standard of evidence in the case of dreams\nthan of apparitions seen in a waking state are ( 1 ) that there is a much greater\nscope for the occurrence of chance coincidences with dreams than with waking\nhallucinations, because the former occur so much more frequently than the latter,\nand (2) that dreams do not, as hallucinations do, take their place in the series of\nexternal events, and the remembrance of them is therefore vaguer, while it is\nmore difficult to assign them to any particular date.\n\f$2 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JUNE, 1901.\nIt is hardly necessary to remark that many,\u2014perhaps most,\u2014of the\n.alleged physical phenomena of Spiritualism are produced fraudulently.\nBut it is sometimes not so fully realised that their investigation presents\nspecial difficulties and requires perhaps a more thorough and careful\ntraining than any other branch of psychical research. (For a discussion\nof the kinds of error specially incidental to the subject, see \" Results\n.of a Personal Investigation into the 'Physical Phenomena' of\nSpiritualism,\" by Mrs. H.

J.\nDavey, Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. IV., pp. 381-495.)

A. Glardon,\nwhose name will be familiar to readers of the Journal in connection\nwith his experiments in telepathy at a distance :\nLA TOUR DE PEILZ, 10th May, 1901.\nAs I had been advised by our late much-regretted friend, F. Myers,.\nI have made a few experiments on the time-calculating power of my\nsubliminal self, and having just achieved a series of forty trials I think\nit advisable to send you now at once the result, because it may\nencourage other members of the S.P.R. to study themselves this\ninteresting phenomenon. By and bye I shall begin a new series of\nexperiments on the same subject.\nLet me first say that I have always been a good sleeper, and so bent\nupon sleeping that I have never been able to awake of my own accord\nat a given time. I have accordingly always used an alarum or got\nmyself called by a servant.\nI used to greatly envy those people who can wake themselves up at\nany time previously fixed upon ; and often have I tried when going to\nbed to fix upon a time for rising in the morning, for instance when I\nhad to take an early train or to start early in the morning for an\nexcursion into the mountains ; but invariably with this result, that I\noverslept myself. Supposing I had to get up at five, I would wake up\nat two o'clock, go to sleep again, wake up again say at half-past three\nor four, remain some time in a state of great wakefulness, then finally\nset down to sleep at half-past four, and remain sleeping till seven or\neight.\nMy plan was to tell myself when going to bed: \"I must get up\nto-morrow, say at five,\" and try to go to sleep with my mind fixed on\nthat hour of five.\nNow, thinking over this lately, the thought came to me that my\nway of putting the question was wrong, because during my sleep the\nsubliminal self had no means of ascertaining the hour, having no clock\nto consult.\nThe only thing it could be asked to do was to take an account of\nthe passing time. Going to sleep at eleven at night, for instance, it\nwas of no use saying that I would wish to get up at five in the morning.\nWhat is five o'clock for the subliminal ?

You will see in it that\nafter the first trials I bethought myself of noting down the state\n\u2022of my pulse, thinking that perhaps the pulsations of the heart were\nused by my inward watcher for the end of numbering the time. I\nfound, and you will see, that it was not the case, as Curing the few\ndays in which I had influenza and a little fever, although my pulse\nwas higher, the watcher did not wake me up any sooner.\nI took about two months and a half to make the forty trials, in\n\u2022order to leave a space between them and to prevent my bodily system\nfalling into a habit of awaking at a given time. I also did vary\n.almost each time the number of minutes allowed for sleeping, not so\nmuch by getting up sooner in the morning as by going to bed at\nirregular hours.\nNow for the results of the forty trials :\nSeven times I woke up at the appointed minute.\nTwenty-four times a little in advance.\nNine times a little later.\nFinally, the most important of all was that the average difference in\n\u2022the forty trials has been only of sixteen and a-half minutes.

There were also present,\nMiss Alice Johnson, Dr. Walter Leaf, Mr. J. G. Piddington, Mr. F.\nPodmore, Mr. Sydney C. Scott, Mrs. H. Sidgwick, Sir Augustus K.\nStephenson, Col. Le M. Taylor, Dr. C. Lloyd Tuckey, Mrs. Verrall, and\nDr. A. Wallace.\nThe minutes of the previous meeting were read, and signed as correct.\nThree new Members and four new Associates were elected. The\nelection of eight new Associates of the American Branch was recorded.\nNames and addresses are given above.\nThe Council recorded with regret the death of the Duchess of Cleve\nland, who for some years had been an Associate of the Society.\nTwo presents to the Library were reported, for which a vote of\nthanks was passed to the donor.\nThe Council resolved in regard to future General Meetings, that\nthere should not be one in July, and that arrangements for meetings in\nthe autumn should be announced in the Journal for October.\nThe Council having come to the conclusion that it would be desirable\nin the interests of the Society to have more accessible and convenient\noffices, the following were appointed a Committee in reference to the\nsubject : The Hon. Secretary, the Hon. Treasurer, Miss Alice Johnson,\nMr. F. Podmore, and Mr. Sydney C. Scott. The Committee were\ninstructed to keep in view the following considerations: that the\nrooms should be in a central situation and quiet position, and that\nthey should, if possible, include one capable of accommodating a\nsocial meeting of about fifty persons, and also space for the storage\nof the Society's publications.\nThe Council decided that their next meeting should be in July, the\nexact date to be fixed later by the Hon. Secretary.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nTHE 114th General Meeting of the Society was held in the West\nminster Town Hall on Friday, June 14th, at 4 p.m.\u2014DR. WALTER\nLEAF in the chair.\nThe CHAIRMAN referred briefly to the address by the Council to the\nmembers and associates of the Society, asking for their support both in\nwork and in money, which was printed in the Journal for June, and\n\fJULY, 1901.] General Meeting. 99\nafterwards circulated as a leaflet. Copies of this leaflet were to be\nhad from the Assistant Secretary at the close of the meeting, and the\nChairman suggested that those persons who were accustomed to attend\nthe meetings merely as visitors might be glad of an opportunity of\nshowing a practical interest in the work of the Society by subscribing\nto its funds.\nME. FRANK PODMORE then read a paper by DR. R. HODGSON on\n\" Some Cases of Secondary Personality.\" Two cases were described in\nthe paper, but there was only time to read the account of one of them,\nknown as the \" Watseka Wonder.\" This case had first appeared in the\nReligio-Philosophical Journal for 1879, and was afterwards published in\npamphlet form by Dr. E. W. Stevens, who had investigated it at\nthe time. Dr. Hodgson afterwards obtained some further evidence in\npersonal interviews with some of the chief witnesses.\nThe case briefly is one of alleged \" possession \" or \" spirit-control.''\nThe subject of the account, Mary Lurancy Vennum, a girl nearly four\nteen years old, living at Watseka, Illinois, became apparently controlled\nby the spirit of Mary Roff, a neighbour's daughter who had died at the\nage of eighteen years and nine months, when Lurancy Vennum was a\nchild of less than ten months old. The most extraordinary feature\nin the case was that the \" control \" by Mary Roff lasted almost\ncontinuously for a period of nearly four months, from February 1st\ntill May 21st, 1878. The narrative by Dr. Stevens was prepared\nshortly afterwards, and is given here in a much abridged form, with\nsome verbal alterations.\nMary Lurancy Vennum, the \" Watseka Wonder,\" was born April 16th,\n1864, in Milford township, about seven miles from Watseka, Illinois. After\nvarious moves in the neighbourhood, the family moved into Watseka on\nApril 1st, 1871, locating about forty rods from the residence of A. B. Roff.\nThey remained at this place during the summer. The only acquaintance\never had between the two families during the season was simply one brief\ncall of Mrs. Roff, for a few minutes, on Mrs. Vennum, which call was never\nreturned, and a formal speaking acquaintance between the two gentlemen.\nSince 1871 the Vennum family have lived entirely away from the vicinity\nof Mr. RofFs, and never nearer than now, on extreme opposite limits of\nthe city.\nIn July, 1877, Lurancy began to have fits or trances, several times\na day, up to January, 1878 ; she was generally believed to be insane, and\nmost friends of the family urged that she should be sent to an insane\nasylum.\nAt this stage Mr. Asa B. Roff, whose daughter, Mary Roff, as we shall\nsee, had had periods of insanity, persuaded Mr. Vennum to allow him to\nbring Dr. E. W. Stevens of Janesville, Wisconsin, to investigate the case.\n\f100 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JULY, 1901.\nOn the afternoon of January 31st, 1878, the two gentlemen repaired to Mr.\nVennum's residence, a little out of the city. Dr. Stevens, an entire stranger\nto the family, was introduced by Mr. Roff at four o'clock p.m. ; no other\npersons present but the family. Lurancy appeared to be in an insane\ncondition.\nShe described herself first as an old woman named Katrina Hogan, and\nthen as a young man named Willie Canning, and after some conversation\nhad another fit, which Dr. Stevens relieved by hypnotising her. She then\nbecame calm, and said that she had been controlled by evil spirits. Dr.\nStevens suggested that she should try to have a better control, and\nencouraged her to try and find one. She then mentioned the names of\nseveral deceased persons, saying there was one who wanted to come, named\nMary Roff.\nMr. Roff being present, said : \" That is my daughter ; Mary Roff is my\ngirl. Why, she has been in heaven twelve years. Yes, let her come, we'll\nbe glad to have her come.\" Lurancy gradually assented to this suggestion,\nand Mr. Roff said to her, \" Have your mother bring you to my house, and\nMary will be likely to come along, and a mutual benefit may be derived\nfrom our former experience with Mary.\"\nOn the following morning, Friday, February 1st, Mr. Vennum called at\nthe office of Mr. Eoff and informed him that the girl claimed to be Mary\nRoff, and wanted to go home. He said, \" She seems like a child real home\nsick, wanting to see her pa and ma and her brothers.\"\nMary Roff was born in Indiana in October, 1846. Her family, after\nseveral changes of residence, made their permanent home in Watseka in\n1859. From the age of six months, Mary had frequently had fits, which\ngradually increased in violence. She also had periods of despondency, in\none of which, in July, 1864, she cut her arm with a knife until she fainted.\nFive days of raving mania followed, after which she recognised no one, and\nseemed to lose all her natural senses, but when blindfolded could read and\ndo everything as if she saw. After a few days she returned to her normal\ncondition, but the fits became still worse, and she died in one of them in\nJuly, 1865.\nAfter her supposed \" control \" of Lurancy began, the latter became mild,\ndocile, polite, and timid, knowing none of her own family, but constantly\npleading to go home.\nAbout a week later, Mrs. A. B. Roff and her daughter, Mrs. Minerva\nAlter, Mary's sister, hearing of the remarkable change, went to see the girl.\nAs they came in sight, far down the street, Mary, looking out of the window,\nexclaimed exultingly, \" There comes my ma and sister Nervie ! \"\u2014the name\nby which Mary used to call Mrs. Alter in girlhood. As they came into the\nhouse she caught them around their necks, wept and cried for joy, and\nseemed so happy to meet them. From this time on she seemed more\nhomesick than before. At times she seemed almost frantic to go home.\nOn the llth day of February, 1878, they sent the girl to Mr. Eoff's, where\nshe met her \" pa and ma,\" and each member of the family, with the most\n\fJULY, 1901.] General Meeting. 101\ngratifying expressions of love and affection, by -words and embraces. On\nbeing asked how long she would stay, she said, \" Uj\u00ab angels will let me stay\ntill some time in May \" ; and she made it her home there till May 21st, three\nmonths and ten days, a happy, contented daughter and sister in a borrowed\nbody.\nThe girl now iu her new home seemed perfectly happy-.and content,\nknowing every person and everything that Mary knew wheu'iVilier original\nbody, twelve to twenty-five years ago, recognising and calling by name those\nwho -were friends and neighbours of the family from 1852 to \"iWSS, .when\nMary died, calling attention to scores, yes, hundreds of incidents that'irjans-\npired during her natural life. During all the period of her sojourn at'Mr.\nRoffs she had no knowledge of, and did not recognise any of Mr. Vennum's\nfamily, their friends or neighbours, yet Mr. and Mrs. Vennum and their\nchildren visited her and Mr. Roffs people, she being introduced to them as\nto any strangers. After frequent visits, and hearing them often and favour\nably spoken of, she learned to love them as acquaintances, and visited them\nwith Mrs. Roff three times.\nOne evening, iu the latter part of March, Mr. Eoff was sitting in the\nroom waiting for tea, and reading the paper, Mary being out in the yard.\nHe asked Mrs. Roff if she could find a certain velvet head-dress that Mary used\nto wear the last year before she died. If so, to lay it on the stand and say\nnothing about it, to see if Mary would recognise it. Mrs. Koff readily found\nand laid it on the stand. The girl soon came in, and immediately exclaimed\nas she approached the stand, \" Oh, there is my head-dress I wore when my\nhair was short ! \" She then asked, \" Ma, where is my box of letters ?\nHave you got them yet?\" Mrs. Eoff replied, \"Yes, Mary, I have some of\nthem.\" She at once got the box with many letters in it. As Mary began to\nexamine them she said, \" Oh, ma, here is a collar I tatted ! Ma, why did\nyou not show to me my letters and things before ? \" The collar had been\npreserved among the relics of the lamented child as one of the beautiful\nthings her fingers had wrought before Lurancy was born ; and so Mary\ncontinually recognised every little thing and remembered every little\nincident of her girlhood.\nIn conversation with Dr. Stevens about her former life, she spoke of\ncutting her arm as hereinbefore stated, and asked if he ever saw where she\ndid it. On receiving a negative answer, she proceeded to slip up her sleeve\nas if to exhibit the scar, but suddenly arrested the movement, as if by a\nsudden thought, and quickly said, \" Oh, this is not the arm ; that one is in\nthe ground,\" and proceeded to tell where it was buried, and how she saw\nit done, and who stood around, how they felt, etc., but she did not feel bad.\nOne afternoon Mary, with much concern and great anxiety, declared that\nher brother Frank must be carefully watched the coming night, for he\nwould be taken very sick, and would die if not properly cared for. At the\ntime of this announcement he was in his usual health, and engaged with the\nRoff Bros.' band of music up town. The same evening Dr. Stevens had\nbeen in to see the family, and on leaving was to go directly to Mrs. Hawks,\n\f102 Journal of Society -for Psychical Research. [JULY, 1901.\nfar off in the Old Town, and the family so understood it. But at about nine\nand a half o'clock the sa\u00bbae evening Dr. Stevens returned unannounced to\nMr. Marsh's, Mr. Roffs.rrext neighbour, for the night. At two o'clock in\nthe morning Frank was attacked with something like a spasm and congestive\nchill, which almost destroyed his consciousness. Mary at once saw the\nsituation as .pfecKc'ted, and said, \" Send to Mrs. Marsh's for Dr. Stevens.\"\n\"No, Dr. St\u00bby*ns is at Old Town,\" said the family. \"No,\" said Mary, \"he\nis at Mr. Marsh's ; go quick for him, pa.\" Mr. Roff called, and the doctor,\nas Mary'said, was at Mr. Marsh's.\nAs'tTie time drew near for the restoration of Lurancy to her parents and\nhoirie, Mary would sometimes seem to recede into the memory and manner\nof Lurancy for a little time, yet not enough to lose her identity or permit\nthe manifestation of Lurancy's mind, but enough to show she was im\npressing her presence upon her own body. On May 7th, however, there was\na complete return of Lurancy for about five minutes. Again, on May 19th,\nin the presence of Henry Vennum, Lurancy's brother, Mary left control for\na time, and Lurancy took full possession of her own body, recognising\nHenry as her brother. The change of control occurred again when Mrs.\nVennum came to see her the same day.\nMary predicted that she should leave the body of Lurancy on May 21st,\nat about eleven o'clock. She arranged that her sister, Mrs. Alter, should\ncome to the house to say good-bye to her, and that when Lurancy came at\neleven o'clock she should take her to Mr. RofFs office, and he would go to\nMr. Vennum's with her. There was some alternation of the control on the\nway, but the final return of the normal Lurancy Vennum took place before\nthey reached Mr. RofFs office, and on arriving at her own home she recog\nnised all the members of her own family as such, and was perfectly well and\nhappy in her own surroundings. A few days later, on meeting Dr. Stevens,\nunder whose care she had been at Mr. Roffs house, she had to be introduced to\nhim as an entire stranger, and treated him as such. The next day she came\nto him spontaneously, saying Mary Roff had told her to come and meet him,\nand had made her feel he had been a very kind friend to her, and she gave\nhim a long message purporting to be from Mary.\nEver since the \" control \" left her, Lurancy's health continued good and\nthere was no return of the fits. She continued to live with her parents until\nJanuary 1st, 1882, when she married a farmer, George Binning. The Roffs\nsaw her often both before and after her marriage, until she moved further west\nin 1884, \" and then,\" Mr. Roff says, \" Mary would take control of Lurancy\njust as she did during the time she was at our house in 1878. . . . Aside\nfrom this, she had little opportunity of using her mediumship, her parents\nbeing afraid to converse with her on the subject lest it should cause a return\nof the ' spells ' (as they called them), . . . and her husband never having\nmade himself acquainted with spiritualism.\"\nDr. Hodgson visited Watseka in April, 1890, and cross-examined the\nprincipal witnesses in the case who were still living in the neighbour\n\fJULY, 1901.] General Meeting. 103\nhood, including Mr. and Mrs. Eoff and their daughter, Mrs. Alter. He\nwrites : \" I have no doubt that the incidents occurred substantially as\ndescribed in the narrative by Dr. Stevens, and in my view the only\nother interpretation of the case\u2014besides the spiritistic\u2014that seems at\nall plausible is that which has been put forward as the alternative to\nthe spiritistic theory to account for the trance-communications of Mrs.\nPiper and similar cases, viz., secondary personality with supernormal\npowers. It would be difficult to disprove this hypothesis in the case\nof the Watseka Wonder, owing to the comparative meagreness of the\nrecord and the probable abundance of ' suggestion ' in the environment,\nand any conclusion that we may reach would probably be determined\nlargely by our convictions concerning other cases. My personal\nopinion is that the 'Watseka Wonder' case belongs in the main\nmanifestations to the spiritistic category.\"\nDR. LEAF observed that the case as read appeared to him to be one\nof hysterical personation, presenting all the familiar classical symptoms\nof that phenomenon. From a pathological point of view it was a\nstriking and instructive case ; but the question of special interest for\nus was whether supernormal intelligence was shown by the \" control \"\nor secondary personality. Of this he thought there was no evidence,\nthat is, there was nothing in the record which would lead us to\nconclude that the \" Mary Eoff\" control had any knowledge of the\naffairs of the Roff family and their friends beyond what she might have\npicked up by normal means. Lurancy Vennum had lived during the\nspring and summer of 1871 in Watseka \"about forty rods from the\nresidence of \" the Eoffs and since then in the suburbs of the same town,\nthough in a different neighbourhood, and would probably have heard\ngossip about them. After she was taken into their house, there must\nhave been numerous opportunities of learning details connected with\nthe life of Mary Eoff. They kept relics of her from which hints could\nbe picked up ; they were very anxious that she should come, and\nencouraged every supposed manifestation of her control. Lurancy had\nconstant talks with Mary's elder sister, Mrs. Alter, and the trivial\ndetails that she showed knowledge of were just such as might have\nbeen picked up in intimate family conversations. It was not likely\nthat we should hear of any of the failures or mistakes of the \"control,''\nwhich could easily be accounted for as the temporary return of\nLurancy. Her prophecy of the illness of Mary's brother was con\nsidered remarkable ; but if a person were attacked at two o'clock in\nthe morning \" with something like a spasm and congestive chill, which\nalmost destroyed his consciousness,\" it is probable that some pre\n\f104 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JULY, 1901.\nmonitory symptoms of it would be perceptible the afternoon before.\nAs to her knowledge that Dr. Stevens was that night lit their next\ndoor neighbour's, and not, as they supposed, in another part of the\ntown, we are not told how much she could have known by normal\nmeans of the doctor's whereabouts. It seemed clear, from the portion\nof the paper read, that leading questions were asked and information\ngiven to her innocently at every turn ; and the witnesses to the case\ndid not seem at all adequately to realise what precautions would have\nbeen necessary to make the evidence for spirit return of value.\nAN ALLEGED CASE OF ELONGATION.\nOne of the most striking manifestations in connection with the\nmediumship of D. D. Home was the phenomenon of elongation. The\nmanifestation belonged to Home's later period, from 1867 to 1870.\nSeveral competent witnesses, including H. D. Jencken, General Boldero,\nViscount Adare, and the Master of Lindsay, have recorded instances\nwhich fell under their own observation. Lord Lindsay, in a paper\nread before the Committee of the Dialectical Society in 1869, thus\ndescribes the manifestation (Report on Spiritualism, of the Committee of\nthe London Dialectical Society, p. 207) :\u2014\nOn another occasion I saw Mr. Home, in a trance, elongated eleven inches.\nI measured him standing up against the wall, and marked the place ; not\nbeing satisfied with that, I put him in the middle of the room and placed a\ncandle in front of him, so as to throw a shadow on the wall, which I also\nmarked. When he awoke I measured him again in his natural size, both\ndirectly and by the shadow, and the results were equal. I can swear that\nhe was not off the ground or standing on tip-toe, as I had full view of his\nfeet, and, moreover, a gentleman present had one of his feet placed over\nHome's insteps, 0:1e hand on his shoulder, and the other on his side where\nthe false ribs come near the hip-bone.\nLater, in answer to a question whether the elongations were in\nthe trunk or legs of the subject, Lord Lindsay replied (Report,\npp. 2134):\nThe top of the hip-bone and the short ribs separate. In Home they are\nunusually close together. There was no separation of the vertebrae of the\nspine ; nor were the elongations at all like those resulting from expanding\nthe chest with air ; the shoulders did not move. Home looked as if he was\npulled up by the neck, the muscles seemed in a state of tension. He stood\nfirmly upright in the middle of the room, and, before the elongation com\nmenced, I placed my foot on his instep. I will swear he never moved his\nheels from the ground. When Home was elongated against the wall, Lord\n\fJULY, 1901.] An Alleged Case of Elongation. 105\nAdare placed his foot on Home's instep, and I marked the place ou the wall.\nI once saw him elongated horizontally on the ground. Lord Adare was\npresent. Home seemed to grow at both ends, and pushed myself and\nAdare away.\nMr. J. J. Morse and a professional \" physical medium \" named\nHerne are said to have been elongated at seances which took place\nin 1870. But no details are given of the manifestations. With these\nunimportant exceptions, the manifestation appears to have been almost\npeculiar to Home. Quite recently, however, we have received from an\nAssociate of the Society, the Rev. C. J. M. Shaw, of the Orchard,\nSwanley, Kent, an account, which is given below, of an elongation\nwhich took place last year in the presence of himself and two\nmembers of his family. Three possible explanations of the phe\nnomenon suggest themselves. (1) Some peculiarity in the conforma\ntion of the medium's body may have admitted of a genuine elongation ;\n(2) the observed results may have been due to trickery of some\nkind on the part of the medium; (3) the observers may have\nexperienced a sensory illusion or quasi-hallucination. The last two\nhypotheses, it should be pointed out, are not mutually exclusive.\nIf trickery was employed, it probably aimed at producing an\nillusion on the part of the spectators, an aim to which the dim light,\nand the expectation produced by the promise made earlier in the day\nof something remarkable in the evening, may no doubt have con\ntributed. As having some possible bearing upon the subject, it should\nbe mentioned that the Rev. C. J. M. Shaw has on several occasions\nexperienced visual hallucinations, which, in two instances at least, have\nbeen shared by others. A collective illusion or hallucination of the\nkind here suggested no doubt goes beyond anything for which we have\nat present adequate evidence, though the accounts of some spiritualist\nseances suggest that collective sense-deceptions may be induced, in a\ndim light, by verbal suggestion. A good illustration of this will be\nfound in the article by Professor Harlow Gale, A Study in Spiritistic\nHallucinations, published in Proceedings S.P.R., vol. xv., p. 65. Perhaps\nsome of our readers may be able to furnish other cases of elongation or\nsimilar phenomena, noted down after, at most, a short interval, which\nmay help to throw light on the matter.\nMr. Shaw first gave Mr. Podmore an account of the incident last\nNovember, and sent him the written account, which is printed below, on\nFebruary 6th, 1901. The interval which elapsed between the event and\nits record is no doubt much to be regretted, but we have three memories to\nrely upon ; and there can be little doubt that the occurrence, whatever\n\f106 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Jctr, 1901.\nits explanation, made at the time a notable impression upon all three\nwitnesses.\nMr. Shaw's Account.\nIn the early part of May [1900] we engaged the services of Mr. Alfred\nPeters for experiments in clairvoyance. This was his second visit to\nour house, and we considered that he had been curiously accurate in\none or two cases of clairvoyance and psychometry.\nOn this special occasion I had had a sitting with him in the after\nnoon and long conversations with his Hindu control, who had expressed\na hope we should obtain something remarkable in the evening.\nWe commenced our evening sitting about 9.30 p.m., \" the Hindu \"\ncontrolling at first and subsequently giving place to a \" Red Indian,\"\nwho is by way of taking charge for \"personations.\" There were several\nof these which had their points of interest, and then \"the Indian\"\nannounced that he thought the conditions were good to produce\n\" elongation \" of the medium's body, which was a rare phenomenon and\nhad only twice been produced before in the person of this medium.\nIt will be better here to give a small plan of the room showing our\nrespective positions :\nFIREPLACE fvarmc;\nO\nf\nA, B, C, Chairs.

The medium took up his position\nstanding at (D) between myself and my brother, who were sitting on\nordinary easy chairs, the seats of which are 14 inches from the\nground. Mrs. S. was sitting at (C) in a rush-bottomed chair rather\nhigher, the seat 16 inches from the ground, and removed a distance of at\nleast four feet from the medium, whom she did not touch during the\nwhole of this part of the sitting ; indeed, we none of us moved from\nour chairs during the whole time.\nThe room was lit by a tall standard round wick lamp placed at (E).\nThis lamp (with a pink shade over it) we turned down, leaving\n\f1901.] An Alleged Case of Elongation. 107\nsufficient light to discern one another quite clearly and the objects in\nthe room. Unfortunately, after the manner of a paraffin lamp, as it\ncooled, the light was reduced a little more than we intended, but was\nnever so low as to prevent our distinguishing everything quite suffi\nciently clearly.\nMy brother at (A) placed his right foot on the medium's left foot, and\nI placed my left foot on the medium's right foot. (The medium was\nwearing ordinary boots.) And then my brother placed his right hand\nand I my left hand on the medium's waist, our other hands grasping\n(at first) the medium's hands.\nThe medium's height as measured by myself against the wall of my\nroom is 5 feet 7J inches. The medium began to sway backwards and\nforwards (his face was towards the sitter at c), sometimes falling so far\nbackward that the back of his head nearly touched the ground. He\nthen began to sway sideways, first one side then the other, disengaging\nhis hands from ours and placing them (below ours) above his hips.\nHe then stretched his hands, with palms open towards (c) and fingers\nextended, straight out above his head ; and with his head thrown back,\nthe motion from side to side becoming less and less till it ceased\naltogether, appeared to be drawn upwards by his hands.\nBoth my brother and I looked to see that we were still on his feet\nand that our hands were on his waist ; we were both conscious that the\nhands we had placed on his waist were being carried up as the\nelongation gradually took place. Keeping our eyes upon him we\nfound that we had to stretch our arms to their fullest extent (without\nrising from our seats) to retain their position on his waist. On my\nattempting to rise from my chair the \" Indian \" requested me to\nremain seated. At last a point was reached when I called to my\nbrother, \" If he goes any higher I can't reach,\" my arm being stretched\nto its very fullest extent; at the same time I was conscious, and so\nwas my brother, that our feet were still on the medium's feet. The\n\"Red Indian\" (who was controlling) called to us then to observe his\nhands, one arm (the hand and fingers being open and extended) being\nquite 6 inches longer than the other; from our position this was\ndifficult for my brother and me to see, but was quite apparent to Mrs. S.\nat (c). Again our attention was directed to the fact that the shorter\narm had been elongated to match the other. We had now arrived at\nthe limit of our own powers of extension, and with a warning from \"the\nIndian\" the medium collapsed on to the floor. He subsided in a sitting\nposition on the floor at the same point at which he was standing. Mrs.\nS., sitting at (c), had a good view of the whole process, and was able\n\f108 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JULY, 1901.\nto note the elongation with reference to the background. When the\nmedium's hands were first raised she saw them against the background\nof the red curtains of the bow window ; she then noted their passing\nthe line (F) (G), which marks a difference of 6 inches between the\nceiling of the bow window and that of the room (the ceiling of the\nbow window being that much lower), and finally remarked his hands\nagainst the background of the ceiling itself. Taking into considera\ntion the distance we had to extend our arms to keep our hands on\nhis waist, one would judge the elongation to have been at the very\nleast a matter of 18 inches.\nThere was no breach of continuity in the clothing apparent\nwhich one might have expected. After the sitting the medium\nappeared much fatigued; still he endeavoured to show us another\ncurious phenomenon ; rubbing his face violently with both hands,\nlong streaks of light became visible through his fingers; this I\nclearly remarked, though it was not noticed by the others.\nWe have tried since on two occasions to obtain a repetition of\nthe phenomenon of elongation, but without success.\nI have written this account of the matter as it presented itself\nto my observation, and it is difficult to see how we can have been\ndeceived.\nI may say that the medium himself drew our attention to the\nunusual length of his arms, and that, as far as our knowledge of him\ngoes, we have never had anything to cause us to doubt his integrity.\nThe medium laid down no conditions whatever (beyond requesting\nthat the lamp be turned down) before commencing the se'ance.\n[Later, Mr. Shaw gave, in answer to Mr. Podmore's questions,\nthe following additional particulars.]\nWhen the seance commenced at 9.30 the medium occupied the chair\nat (c), Mrs. S. then sitting at (D). At about 10.15, for the experiment\nin \"elongation,\" he changed his position and stood at (D), Mrs. S.\nmoving to (c).\nThe only chair near (D) I pushed away when the medium began\nto sway backwards and forwards, fearing he would knock himself\nagainst it.\nThe curtains of the bow window follow the shape of the bow,\nand were distant from the medium at his back quite 8 feet and on\nhis left side a distance of about 5 feet; a small inlaid writing\nbureau with sloping lid separating him from the edge of the curtain\non his left.\n\fJULY, 1901.] An Alleged Case of Elongation. 10!>\nAfter the medium fell, which he did in a sitting position on the\nfloor with his knees near to his chin, he complained of discomfort,\netc., and stiffness, and asked if \" they had been elongating him.\"\nC.

After full consideration, however, the Council decided not\nto take any steps in the matter.\nThe schedule used for the enquiry is as follows :\nINQUIRY INTO HUMAN SENTIMENT WITH REGARD TO A\nFUTURE LIFE.\nThere is a widespread literary tradition that men naturally desire a future\nlife. From this assumed fact it has been variously argued that (1) such a\nuniversal desire cannot be destined to disappointment, and (2) it must\nvitiate convictions and engender illusory evidence in its own support.\nBut there is some reason to suppose, both from the ordinary conduct of\nmen and from sporadic declarations of individuals, that this tradition is very\nfar from accurately representing the facts, and that these are actually more\nvarious and complicated. Moreover, it should not be forgotten that in\nIndia the literary tradition seems to be exactly reversed, and it is assumed\nthat men naturally crave for extinction or absorption in the Absolute.\nIt becomes a question, therefore, what the actual sentiments of men are,\nand what, consequently, is the actual bias with which they are likely to\nreceive the doctrines and the evidence that bear on the subject.\nBoth these questions are capable of being determined with sufficient\nprecision by instituting a statistical inquiry over a sufficiently wide field\u2014\ncollecting answers until it becomes evident that the percentages of the\nvarious types of answer have become constant.\nTo determine the nature of men's actual sentiments and actual bias should\nbe a matter of great interest, not only to the S.P.R. and psychologists\ngenerally, but also to every religious organization. For both the scientific\n\f110 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JULY, 1901.\nlabours of the former and the moral exhortations of the latter are likely to\nbe in some degree, at least, ineffectual, so long as they are conducted in\nignorance, and so in disregard, of what men really want. It is only when\nthe facts have been ascertained that they can be argued from for the various\npurposes of the scientist, the philosopher and the theologian.\nFirst of all, therefore, it is necessary to discover the nature of human\nsentiment ; and to obtain it in its purity, it is desirable to exclude, as far as\npossible, all extraneous influences, whether of a religious or of a scientific\nkind. It is, of course, recognized that these may and often do influence\nsentiment, that they may engender or check it, as also that there may be a\nmarked divergence between conviction or belief and sentiment. But as it is\nprimarily the nature of the sentiment which has to be determined, these\nother considerations should be excluded as far as possible.\nHence the subjoined questions should be understood as directly referring only\nto the personal preferences, sentiments or desires of those who answer them, quite\nirrespective of their religious faith or reasoned convictions, the influence of\nwhich, where it exists, may be recorded in answer to Question III.\nPlease return this questionnaire when answered to\nDR.

The\nelection of ten new Associates of the American Branch was recorded.\nNames and addresses are given above.\nA list of annual subscriptions and donations made in response to the\nrecent appeal by the Council was read. The annual subscriptions\namounted to \u00a384 14s., and the donations to \u00a3140 9s.\nThe following were at their request transferred from the list of\nAssociates to that of Members : Mrs. Arthur Bulley, Lady Butt, Mr.\nFrancis Clarke, Rev. E. H. Gardiner, Rev. W. S. Grignon, Mr. H. H.\nGrubbe, Mr. W. H. Hamilton, Miss Hartshorn, Mr. F. W. H.\nHutchinson, Miss A. R. Marten, Prof. G. G. Murray, Mr. E. T. Nisbet\n(Hon. Associate), Mrs. Passingham, Mr. Lewis C. Powles, Miss Ridley,\nProf. C. W. Sellin, Miss E. Shove, Mr. Chester A. Snow, Commander\nH. Swire, Mrs. Tebb, and Mr. Edmund P. Wells.\nThe Committee appointed at the last meeting of the Council, in\nreference to new rooms for the Society, reported that they had in\nspected various offices, but that they advised waiting on the chance of\nobtaining some advantageous premises which would not be vacant for\nsome months. With a view to this, arrangements had been made for\ncontinuing the present tenancy till Christmas, 1901.\nA letter was read from the Assistant-Secretary, in which he said that\nhe felt the time had arrived when, from length of service and lapse of\n\fOCT., 1901.] Meeting of the Council. 115\nyears, he could best serve the .S. P. R. by asking the Council shortly to\nallow him to retire from his present position. He therefore placed in\nthe hands of the Council his resignation of the assistant-secretaryship\nat the end of the quarter following the completion of twenty years'\nservice, namely, at the end of March, 1 902. The President proposed,\nand Professor Barrett seconded, the following resolution, which was\ncarried unanimously: \"That the Council place on record their appre\nciation of the long and faithful services of Mr. E. T. Bennett to the\nSociety ; and that they accept with regret his retirement at Easter,\n1902. They elect him an Hon. Associate of the Society, and request\nhim to accept a retiring allowance of \u00a340 a-year.\"\nIt was proposed by the President, and seconded by Mrs. Sidgwick,\nthat in future not more than three General Meetings of the Society\nshould be held in the course of a year, but that a few private meetings,\nfor Members and Associates only, should be held in addition. This\nwas carried unanimously.\nThe date of the next Council meeting was left to be arranged later.\nREDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF GENERAL MEETINGS\nOF THE SOCIETY.\nWe wish to draw the attention of Members and Associates to the\nresolution which was passed unanimously by the Council at their last\nmeeting, on August 3rd,\u2014that in future not more than three General\nMeetings of the Society should be held in the course of a year, but\nthat, in addition to these, a few private meetings, for Members and\nAssociates only, should be held.\nThe reasons for this change may be briefly stated as follows : For\nseveral years past a very large proportion of those present at the General\nMeetings have been visitors, the members and associates constituting,\nas a rule, considerably less than a quarter of the audience. The\nvisitors may be roughly divided into two classes : the casual visitor,\nwho comes once or twice out of curiosity, and then takes no further\ninterest in the Society ; and the habitud, who, while his regular attendance\nshows that he derives either instruction or amusement from the papers\nand discussions, contributes nothing either to the finances or to the\nwork of the Society. In other words, the General Meetings have been\npatronised much more by the outside public than by the members.\nIt is felt also that the size of the audience debars many members from\ntaking part in the discussions, in which they might be more ready to\n\f116 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [OCT., 1901.\njoin at smaller and private meetings. And at smaller and less formal\nmeetings it would be possible to bring forward cases and papers which,\nthough not intended for publication\u2014at least as they stand\u2014are yet\ninteresting or suggestive, and might serve as a basis for discussion.\nOur present rooms, however, are not nearly large enough for\nmembers to meet in, so that the meetings cannot be organised until\nnew rooms are taken. It will be remembered that one of the purposes\nfor which the Council made its recent appeal for further support was to\nprovide a larger and more commodious set of offices, and we hope that\nmembers who are interested in the plan of private meetings will be\ninclined to contribute to the fund, the present state of which is shown\nin the list of subscriptions printed below, on p. 128.\nTHE FIRE WALK CEREMONY IN TAHITI.\nSome striking accounts of the Fire Walk, as practised in many\ndifferent countries and described in some cases by European witnesses,\nwere given in Mr. Andrew Lang's paper on the subject in our\nProceedings, vol. xv., pp. 2-15, and readers of the Journal will remember\nthe equally remarkable recent Indian cases reported by Mr. Henry K.\nBeauchamp in the Journal for November, 1900 (vol. ix., pp. 312-321).\nWe think it worth while, therefore, to reprint here in full a letter that\nappeared in Nature, of August 22nd, 1901, from the pen of Professor\nS. P. Langley, of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, U.S.A.\n(who is also a Vice-President of our Society), and who has recently\nwitnessed the ceremony in Tahiti. It will be seen that Professor\nLangley succeeded in making more crucial tests of the temperature of\ndifferent parts of the fire than have, as far as we know, been applied in\nany other case, with the result that there appeared to be nothing\nsupernormal in the performance he witnessed. It must, indeed, be\nremembered that the details of the ceremony vary a good deal in\ndifferent places and as practised by different persons, as will be seen\nby comparison of the various accounts referred to above. But the case\nnow to be quoted seems to have been more completely observed, and\nthat by a more competent observer, than any other yet recorded.\nThe very remarkable descriptions of the \" Fire Walk \" collected by Mr.\nAndrew Lang and others had aroused a curiosity in me to witness the original\nceremony, which I have lately been able to gratify in a visit to Tahiti.\nAmong those notable accounts is one by Colonel Gudgeon, British Resi\ndent at Raratonga, describing the experiment by a man from Raiatea, and\nalso a like account of the Fiji fire ceremony from Dr. T. M. Hocken, whose\n\fOCT., 1901.] The Fire Walk Ceremony in Tahiti. 117\narticle is also quoted in Mr. Lang's paper on the \" Fire Walk \" in the\nProceedings of the Society for Psychical Research, February, 1900. This\nextraordinary rite is also described by Mr. Fraser in the Golden Bough and\nby others.\nI had heard that it was performed in Tahiti in 1897, and several persons\nthere assured me of their having seen it, and one of them of his having walked\nthrough the fire himself under the guidance of the priest, Papa-Ita, who is\nsaid to be one of the last remnants of a certain order of the priesthood of\nRaiatea, and who had also performed the rite at the island of Hawaii some\ntime in the present year, of which circumstantial newspaper accounts were\ngiven, agreeing in all essential particulars with those in the accounts already\ncited. According to these, a pit was dug in which large stones were heated\nred hot by a fire which had been burning many hours. The upper stones\nwere pushed away just before the ceremony, so as to leave the lower stones\nto tread upon, and over these, \"glowing red hot \" (according to the news\npaper accounts), Papa-Ita had walked with naked feet, exciting such\nenthusiasm that he was treated with great consideration by the whites, and\nby the natives as a god. I found it commonly believed in Tahiti that any\none who choose to walk after him, European or native, could do so in\nsafety, secure in the magic which he exercises, if his instructions were\nexactly followed. Here in Tahiti, where he had \" walked \" four years before,\nit was generally believed among the natives, and even among the Europeans\npresent who had seen the ceremony, that if any one turned around to look\nback he immediately was burned, and I was told that all those who followed\nhim through the fire were expected not to turn until they had reached\nthe other side in safety, when he again entered the fire and led them back\nby the path by which he had come. I was further told by several who had\ntried it that the heat was not felt upon the feet, and that when shoes\nwere worn the soles were not burned (for those who followed the priest's\ndirections), but it was added by all that much heat was felt about the head.\nSuch absolutely extraordinary accounts of the performance had been given\nto me by respectable eye-witnesses and sharers in the trial, confirming those\ngiven iu Hawaii, and, in the main, the cases cited by Mr. Lang, that I could\nnot doubt that if all these were verified by my own observation, it would\nmean nothing less to me than a departure from the customary order of\nNature, and something very well worth seeing indeed.\nI was glad, therefore, to meet personally the priest, Papa-Ita. He is the\nfinest looking native that I have seen ; tall, dignified in bearing, with\nunusually intelligent features. I learned from him that he would perform\nthe ceremony on Wednesday, July 17, the day before the sailing of our ship.\nI was ready to provide the cost of the fire, if he could not obtain it other\nwise, but this proved to be unnecessary.\nPapa-Ita himself spoke no English, and I conversed with him briefly\nthrough an interpreter. He said that he walked over the hot stones without\ndanger by virtue of spells which he was able to utter and by the aid of a\ngoddess (or devil as my interpreter had it), who was formerly a native of the\n\f118 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [OCT., 1901.\nislands. The spells, he said, were something which he could teach another.\nI was told by others that there was a still older priest in the Island of\nRaiatea, whose disciple he was, although he had pupils of his own, and that\nhe could \" send his spirit \" to Raiatea to secure the permission of his senior\npriest if necessary.\nIn answer to my inquiry as to what preparations he was going to make\nfor the rite in the two or three days before it, he said he was going to pass\nthem in prayer.\nThe place selected for the ceremony fortunately was not far from the ship.\nI went there at noon and found that a large shallow pit or trench had been\ndug, about nine feet by twenty-one feet and about two feet deep. Lying\nnear by was a pile containing some cords of rough wood and a pile of\nrounded water-worn stones, weighing, I should think, from forty to eighty\npounds apiece. They were, perhaps, 200 in number, and all of porous\nbasalt, a feature the importance of which will be seen later. The wood was\nplaced in the trench, the fire was lighted and the stones heaped on it, as\nI was told, directly after I left, or at about twelve o'clock.\nAt 4.0 P.M. I went over again and found the preparations very nearly\ncomplete. The fire had been burning for nearly four hours. The outer\nstones touched the ground only at the edges of the pile, where they did\nnot burn my hand, but as they approached the centre the stones were heaped\nup into a mound three or four layers deep, at which point the lowest\nlayers seen between the upper ones were visibly red-hot. That these latter\nwere nevertheless sending out considerable heat there could be no ques\ntion, though the topmost stones were certainly not red-hot, while those at\nthe bottom were visibly so and were occasionally splitting with loud\nreports, while the flames from the burnt wood near the centre of the pile\npassed up in visible lambent tongues, both circumstances contributing to\nthe eifect upon the excited bystanders.\nThe upper stones, I repeat, even where the topmost were presently re\nmoved, did not show any glow to the eye, but were unquestionably very\nhot and certainly looked unsafe for naked feet. Native feet, however, are\nnot like European ones, and Mr. Richardson, the chief engineer of the\nship, mentioned that he had himself seen elsewhere natives standing un\nconcerned with naked feet on the cover of pipes conveying steam at about\n300\u00b0 F., where no European feet could even lightly rest for a minute. The\nstones then were hot. The crucial question was, how hot was the upper\npart of this upper layer on which the feet were to rest an instant in passing ?\nI could think of no ready thermometric method that could give an abso\nlutely trustworthy answer, but I could possibly determine on the spot the\nthermal equivalent of one of the hottest stones trodden on. (It was sub\nsequently shown that the stone might be much cooler at one part than\nanother.) Most obviously, even this was not an easy thing to do in the\ncircumstances, but I decided to try to get at least a trustworthy approxima\ntion. By the aid of Chief Engineer Richardson, who attended with a stoker\nand one of the quartermasters, kindly detailed at my request by the ship's\n\fOCT., 1901.] The Fire Walk Ceremony in Tahiti. 119\nmaster, Captain Lawless, I prepared for the rough but conclusive experi\nment presently described.\nIt was now nearly forty minutes after four, when six acolytes (natives),\nwearing crowns of flowers, wreathed with garlands, and bearing poles nearly\nfifteen feet long, ostensibly to be used as levers in toppling over the upper\nstones, appeared. They were supposed to need such long poles because of the\ndistance at which they must stand on account of the heat radiated from the\npile, but I had walked close beside it a moment before and satisfied myself\nthat I could have manipulated the stones with a lever of one-third the length,\nwith some discomfort, but with entire safety. Some of the uppermost\nstones only were turned over, leaving a superior layer, the long poles being\nneedlessly thrust down between the stones to the bottom, where two of\nthem caught fire at their extremities, adding very much to the impression\nthat the exposed layer of stones was red hot, when in fact they were not,\nat least to the eye. These long poles and the way they were handled were,\nthen, a part of the ingenious \"staging \" of the whole spectacle.\nNow the most impressive part of the ceremony began. Papa-Ita, tall,\ndignified, flower-crowned and dressed with garlands of flowers, appeared\nwith naked feet and with a large bush of \" Ti \" leaves in his hands, and,\nafter going partly around the fire each way uttering what seemed to be\ncommands to it, went back and beating the stones nearest him three times\nwith the \" Ti \" leaves, advanced steadily, but with obviously hurried step,\ndirectly over the central ridge of the pile. Two disciples, similarly dressed,\nfollowed him, but they had not the courage to do so directly along the heated\ncentre. They followed about half-way between the centre and the edge,\nwhere the stones were manifestly cooler, since I had satisfied myself that\nthey could be touched lightly with the hand. Papa-Ita then turned and led\nthe way back, this time with deliberate confidence, followed on his return by\nseveral new disciples, most of them not keeping exactly in the steps of the\nleader, but obviously seeking cooler places. A third and fourth time Papa-\nIta crossed with a larger following, after which many Europeans present\nwalked over the stones without reference to the priest's instructions. The\nnatives were mostly in their bare feet. One wore stockings. No European\nattempted to walk in bare feet except in one case, that of a boy, who, I was\ntold, found the stones too hot and immediately stepped back.\nThe mise en scbne was certainly noteworthy. The site, near the great\nocean breaking on the barrier reefs, the excited crowd, talking about the\n\"red-hot\" stones, the actual sight of the hierophant and his acolytes making\nthe passage along the ridge where the occasional tongues of flame were seen\nat the centre, with all the attendant circumstances, made up a scene in no\nway lacking in interest. Still, the essential question as to the actual heat of\nthese stones had not yet been answered, and after the fourth passage I\nsecured Papa-Ita'a permission to remove, from the middle of the pile, one\nstone which from its size and position every foot had rested upon in crossing,\nand which was undoubtedly at least as hot as any one of those trodden on.\nIt was pulled out by my assistants with difficulty, as it proved to be larger\n\f120 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Ocr., 1901.\nthan I had expected, it being of ovoid shape with the lower end in the\nhottest part of the fire. I had brought over the largest wooden bucket\nwhich the ship had, and which was half-filled with water, expecting that\nthis would cover the stone, but it proved to be hardly enough. The stone\ncaused the water to rise nearly to the top of the bucket, and it was thrown\ninto such violent ebullition that a great deal of it boiled over and escaped\nweighing. The stone was an exceedingly bad conductor of heat, for it\ncontinued to boil the water for about twelve minutes, when, the ebullition\nbeing nearly over, it was removed to the ship and the amount of evaporated\nwater measured.\nMeanwhile others, as I have said, began to walk over the stones without\nany reference to the ceremony prescribed by Papa-Ita, and three or four\npersons, whom I personally knew on board the ship, did so in shoes, the\nsoles of which were not burned at all. One of the gentlemen, however, who\ncrossed over with unburned shoes, showed me that the ends of his trousers\nhad been burnt by the flames which leaped up between the stones, and\nwhich at all times added so much to the impressiveness of the spectacle,\nand there was no doubt that any one who stumbled or got a foot caught\nbetween the hot stones might have been badly burned. United States\nDeputy-Consul Ducorran, who was present, remarked to me that he knew\nthat Papa-Ita had failed on a neighbouring island, with stones of a marble-\nlike quality, and he offered to test the heat of these basaltic ones by seeing\nhow long he could remain on the hottest part of the pile, and he stood there,\nin my sight, from eight to ten seconds before he felt the heat through the\nthin soles of his shoes beginning to be unpleasantly warm.\nA gentleman present asked Papa-Ita why he did not give an exhibit that\nwould be convincing by placing his foot, even for a few seconds, between\ntwo of the red-hot stones which could be seen glowing at the bottom of the\npile, to which Papa-Ita replied with dignity, \" My fathers did not tell me to\ndo it that way.\" I asked him if he would hold one of the smaller, upper\nhot stones in his hand. He promised to do so, but he did not do it.\nThe outer barriers were now removed and a crowd of natives pressed in.\nI, who was taking these notes on the spot, left, after assuring myself that\nthe stones around the edge of the pit were comparatively cold, although the\ncentre was no doubt very hot, and those below red hot. The real question\nis, I repeat, how hot were those trodden on ? and the answer to this I was\nto try to obtain after measuring the amount of water boiled away.\nOn returning to the ship this was estimated from the water which was\nleft in the bucket (after allowing for that spilled over) at about ten pounds.\nThe stone, which it will be remembered was one of the hottest, if not the\nhottest, in the pile, was found to weigh sixty-five pounds, and to have\nevaporated this quantity of water. It was, as I have said, a volcanic stone,\nand on minuter examination proved to be a vesicular basalt, the most\ndistinctive feature of which was its porosity and non-conductibility, for it\nwas subsequently found that it could have been heated red hot at one end,\nwhile remaining comparatively cool at the top. I brought a piece of it to\n\fOCT., 1901.] The Fire Walk Ceremony in Tahiti. 121\nWashington with me and there determined its specific gravity to be 0'39, its\nspecific heat 0'19, and its conductivity to be so extremely small that one end\nof a small fragment could be held in the hand while the other was heated\nindefinitely in the flame of a blow-pipe, almost like a stick of sealing-wax.\nThis partly defeated the aim of the experiment (to find the temperature of\nthe upper part of the stone), since only the mean temperature was found.\nThis mean temperature of the hottest atone of the upper layer, as deduced\nfrom the above data, was about 1200 degrees Fahrenheit, but the tempera\nture of the surface must have been indefinitely lower. The temperature at\nwhich such a stone begins to show a dull red in daylight is, so far as I am\naware, not exactly determined, but is approximately 1300 to 1400 degrees\nFahrenheit.\nTo conclude, I could entertain no doubt that I had witnessed substantially\nthe scenes described by the gentlemen cited, and I have reason to believe\nthat I saw a very favourable specimen of a \" Fire Walk.\"\nIt was a sight well worth seeing. It was a most clever and interesting\npiece of savage magic, but from the evidence I have just given I am obliged\nto say (almost regretfully) that it was not a miracle. S. P. LANGLEY.\nSmithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., August 7.\nSome comments by Mr. Andrew Lang on this account have since\nappeared in the Morning Post. We hope to print a further contribution\nfrom Mr. Lang on the subject in our next number.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n[The Editor is not responsible for opinions expressed by Correspondents.]\nON THE ATTITUDE OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH\nTOWARDS THE SPIRITISTIC HYPOTHESIS.\nTo the Editor of the\nJOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nL\nMAY I attempt to voice an uneasy feeling which I believe many\nmembers have with regard to the future of the Society. It is true\nthat in some respects we stand at the parting of the ways, and much\ncare and tolerance will be needed to keep the Society together.\nUp to now the task we have been engaged on has been a scientific\none, and Mr. Myers in his Presidential Address rightly insisted on the\nintellectual virtues of curiosity, candour, and care. But to those who,\n\f122 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [OCT., 1901.\nthrough the investigations of the Society, have arrived at the conviction\nthat communications with discarnate intelligences are possible, these\nvirtues are not sufficient. They require to be supplemented by the\nmoral virtues of faith, patience, and sympathy. Faith, because he\nthat comes to the spirits must believe that they exist, and that in some\ncases they are able and willing to communicate with mankind.\nPatience amid the almost inevitable delays and disappointments\nwhile developing mediumship in oneself or others ; sympathy, in\norder that your circle may not be the resort of frivolous or per\nsonating spirits, but of those who come to seek for help or to give\ninstruction.\nIn short, this branch of our inquiry is an art as well as a science,\ndealing as it does with intelligences as well as with psychic laws.\nNow, some of our members may have a special aptitude for discovery\non what may be called the artistic side of our work. But the question\nwhether artists and scientists are to work together in one society will\nreally depend on the attitude of the scientists, as artists are a tender\nfolk and easily scared away by suggestions of fraud or even of\ncredulity.\nAll will feel that our late President, with his many-sided sympathies,\nwould have kept both sections together. Let us hope that the present\nleaders will be true to his memory and not let a difference of method\ndivide those who will travel so much further along the right road if\nonly they hold together.\nLAWRENCE J. JONES.\nAugust, 1901.\nII.\nI have read Sir Lawrence Jones' important letter with much interest\nand sympathy. He there touches on what has always been and what\nstill is one of our most difficult questions of policy. He urges that we\nare not only a scientific society, but that by reason of the nature of our\nresearches we must have a side more human and more considerate or\ndiplomatic than societies which deal with matters less closely linked\nwith emotion and conduct. In this respect he is undoubtedly right.\nWe do not compare in this respect with a physical or an astronomical\nor even a biological society ; we are more akin to an anthropological\nsociety. And in studying the habits and customs of Aborigines it is\nproverbially necessary to enter into sympathetic relations with them,\nnot to trouble or confuse them with a missionary attitude, and not to\nfrighten them by hostile suggestions, but to enter for the time into\n\fOCT., 1901.] Correspondence. 123\ntheir spirit, and learn from them what they have to teach. That\nbranch of anthropological inquiry is no doubt an \" art \" as well as a\nscience, dealing as it does with religious'emotions and social prejudices\nas well as with mere intelligence. On the other hand, it must be\nadmitted that although the sympathetic and receptive attitude has its\nplace, it cannot be allowed a dominating position, otherwise the\ninvestigator would tend to become a disciple, and the scientific might\ndegenerate into a propagandist society, having a creed and body of\northodox doctrine, held not on the ground of knowledge but in an\natmosphere of faith.\nIndeed, the word \" faith \" is the only one to which I take definite\nexception in Sir Lawrence Jones' amiable and judicious letter. If\nhe would substitute for the word \"faith\" the word \"open-minded-\nness,\" and modify the sentence following so as to continue thereafter :\n\" because in entering upon the investigation of an unknown psychic\nuniverse every possibility must be admitted as conceivable, and the\nhypothesis of communications from beings other than man must by\nno means be excluded,\" I could myself endorse the whole letter as a\nstatement of the special difficulties which we have to encounter in this\ninvestigation and the opposite attitudes which are necessary, whether\ncombined in one or in many individuals. It would be a great pity if\nthose with special powers for helping our work on one side\u2014those\nwhom the writer calls \" artists \"\u2014should eliminate themselves from the\nconjoint work; especially since, on the other hand, those whom the\nwriter calls \" scientists \" are at present conspicuous chiefly by their\nabsence from our society, being for the most part amazed at what they\nconsider the ludicrously sympathetic and credulous attitude of those\nfew men of science whom our work has attracted. It is to be re\nmembered, therefore, that the need for sympathy and delicate handling\nis not confined to one side alone ; and the ever-present problem, now\njust as living as at the birth of the society, is how best to unite the\nscientific and intellectual virtues with the moral and emotional powers,\nstriving not to exclude any one whose mind is open enough to examine\nand criticise the evidence, nor yet one whose powers are developed\nenough to add to our slow accumulation of criticised and trustworthy\nfacts. OLIVER LODGE.\nIII.\nSir Lawrence Jones' catalogue of the qualities required in an investi\ngation such as ours seems to me, with one exception\u2014an exception\nalready made by our President\u2014to be admirably selected. No doubt\n\f124 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Ocr., 1901.\nin all scientific undertakings the virtues of curiosity, candour, and care\nare essential ; and in most cases there should be added to them patience\nand sympathy. It was precisely the lack of these two latter virtues\nthat led the medical men of Elliotson's day to reject, with such\nunfortunate results, the evidence for the hypnotic trance, to see in\nthe Okey girls merely a couple of commonplace impostors, to believe\nthat a poor man who had his leg cut 'off in the trance had concealed the\npain of the operation merely to oblige the mesmerist, to ignore the\nadmirable work of Braid, and to class Elliotson, Esdaile, Townshend,\nand the rest as a set of weak-minded and credulous enthusiasts. It\nwould be unpardonable if members of the S.P.R., with such an example\nbehind them, were to repeat the mistakes of a former generation, and\nreject phenomena which they had never taken the trouble to under\nstand. That, I take it, is the danger which Sir L. Jones sees reason\nto apprehend.\nBut when he speaks of Faith as an essential qualification in our\npresent undertaking, it is necessary to enter a protest. Faith, I take\nit, is belief in something which is insufficiently proved, or is perhaps\nincapable of proof. In either sense Faith may legitimately find place,\nnot merely in the sphere of religion, but in our social activities and in\nour conduct generally. No doubt in the widest sense we live by faith :\nwithout faith action of any kind, and even life itself, would be impos\nsible. But faith in a scientific inquiry is surely irrelevant or mischievous.\nAs a mere working hypothesis, spirits or odylic fluid or anything else\nis legitimate ; the working hypothesis ceases to be legitimate so soon\nas it becomes an article of faith. The previous example of the history\nof mesmerism in this country will serve as an illustration. Correlative\nto the want of sympathy and patience shown by men like Wakley and\nMarshall Hall was the faith not according to knowledge displayed, if\nnot conspicuously by Elliotson himself, at any rate by many of his\nfollowers. To us, looking back on that ridiculous and discreditable\nchapter in the history of science, it is difficult to decide which party\nwas most to blame. At any rate, if the mesmerists had been content to\ntake their stand upon the facts, and to allow that the interpretation\nwas a question, not of dogma but of logic, it seems probable that their\nopponents would have shown more tolerance and ultimately more\nintelligence. The belief in spirits may or may not be better founded\nthan the belief in odylic fluids to which the mesmerists of 1840-50\nchallenged their contemporaries ; but neither fluids nor spirits will\nadvance their cause by employing Faith as their advocate in the court\nof science. FRANK PODMORE.\n\fOCT., 1901.] CoiTespondence. 125\nIV.\nThe use of the word \"faith\" in Sir Lawrence Jones' letter seems to\nbe the point which challenges criticism. Mr. Podtnore has stated very\nclearly and convincingly the danger that would arise if the Society as a\nwhole approached the problems which it hopes to solve in a spirit of\nfaith as well as with the patience and sympathy whose value is urged\nby Sir Lawrence Jones. But I did not myself understand that this was\nthe contention of his letter. I take it rather that Sir Lawrence Jones\nurges that the time has come for the Society to make full use of the special\nqualities of certain of its members, those whom he happily describes as\n\"artists,\" and that among those qualities he places foremost that of\nfaith. All that he asks of the other members of the Society is that\nthey should remember that artists are easily scared away by suggestions\nof fraud or credulity.\nBut if Sir Lawrence Jones is asking for more than this, and claiming\nthat the Society as such should possess the moral qualities of the artist\nas well as the intellectual virtues appropriate to the man of science,\nthen I think we must agree with our President that \" open-minded-\nness \" is to be preferred to \" faith.\"\nMARGARET DE G. VERRALL.\nV.\nI notice that Sir Lawrence Jones does not urge the supplementary\nvirtues of faith, patience, and sympathy on the plain psychical\nresearcher, who is still seeking and has not yet reached any\nconclusions, but only on \" those who through the investigations of the\nSociety have arrived at the conviction that communications with dis-\ncarnate intelligences are possible.\" For these latter the advice is, I\nventure to think, superfluous.\nBut if Sir Lawrence Jones means by inference to urge the desirability\nof faith on those who so far have found the evidence for spirit\ncommunication unconvincing, then his advice seems to me not unlike\nthat of the missionary who, anxious for the conversion of an atheist,\nimplores him to pray.\nBut I should like to hear a definition of \" Faith.\" Does it\nmean a general faith in the sincerity of mediums and clairvoyants,\nprofessional or private 1 or a faith in the probability of survival\nafter death and of spirit communication ? or, vaguely, a faith that\n\" there's something in it \" 1\n\f126 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [OCT., 1901.\nI fully realise that frequent opportunities for the investigation of\nunprofessional mediums are being, and (it is no new thing) have been,\nlost owing to a dislike of the Society's methods. But I doubt if there\nbe any way out of the dilemma. The spiritualist with his more sym\npathetic attitude may obtain better phenomena, but just in consequence\nof his more sympathetic method he is not in a position to present\nthe evidence in such a manner as to bring conviction to the\noutside world.\nThis is not the first time that our Society has been warned of\nthe dangers of its critical methods. We can but point to our past\nrecord, and to Sir Lawrence Jones' own admission that, thanks to the\ninvestigations of the Society and in spite of the rigour with which\nthe evidence has been handled, conviction has been brought to\nsome minds that communications with discarnate intelligences are\npossible.\nI would beg those who regard our more sceptical members as\nwanting in patience and sympathy to remember that none desire more\nardently than these very sceptics to be able to believe. It is the\nsupreme and intimate importance of the subject that explains and\njustifies their caution. Their longing to discover grounds for belief in\nexistence after death, their patience in what must appear to them\nan almost hopeless quest, and the very fact that they do not take their\nstand with the vast majority of men who will not trouble to investigate\nat all, should be the best guarantee of their earnestness and of their\nfundamental sympathy.\nJ.

Names and addresses are given\nabove.\nA donation of \u00a35, from Mr. Edward J.

Bannerman,\nMiss H. Dunham, Mr. G. Palmer Harding, Sir Lawrence J. Jones,\nBart., Mrs. Nicolls, and Mrs. Robert Ogilvie.\nThe Council recorded with regret the deaths of Lady Mount-Temple,\nwho had been a Member of the Society almost from its foundation, and\nof Captain Ronald B. Miers, an Associate of the Society since 1898,\nwho lost his life in South Africa.\nSome presents to the Library were on the table, for which a vote\nof thanks was passed to the donors.\nThe Committee appointed to select an Organising Secretary reported\nthat, after careful consideration of the claims of various candidates for\nthe post, they were unanimous in recommending the election of Mr. N.\nW. Thomas. After an interview with Mr. Thomas, and a full con\nsideration of the matter, a resolution was unanimously carried, on the\nproposition of Sir William Crookes, seconded by Professor Barrett, that\nthe recommendation of the Committee be approved, and Mr. Thomas\nwas accordingly elected. Mr. F. Podmore, Mr. H. Arthur Smith, and\nMr. J. G. Piddington were subsequently appointed a Committee to\ncarry on negotiations in regard to the future rooms of the Society. It\nwas also agreed that the tenancy of the present rooms should be\ncontinued till Lady Day, 1902.\nA letter was read from the Assistant-Secretary, briefly acknowledging\nhis sense of the kindness of the Council in the minute they passed\nat the meeting in August, and thanking them for the liberality of\nthe resolution adopted, and also expressing the hope that he may\nstill be able in some ways to further the work of the Society.\nIt was agreed that a General Meeting be held on Friday, November\n29th. It was left to the Hon. Secretary to fix later the place and hour\nof the meeting, as, the Westminster Town Hall not being available for\nthe present, it would be necessary to engage some other hall to meet in.\nThe next Council Meeting was fixed for the same date, the place\nand time being dependent on the arrangements made for the General\nMeeting.\n\f132 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1901.\nAPPOINTMENT OF AN ORGANISING SECRETARY.\nAs recorded in the report of the Council meeting held on October\n25th, Mr. Northcote W. Thomas, M.A., has been appointed Organising\nSecretary to the Society ; and thus one important item of the scheme\nindicated in the recent address by the Council to Members has been\ncarried into effect.\nMr. Thomas matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1887,\nand there gained the Greaves Prize (English Historical Essay Prize),\nin 1889, and took honours in the Historical Tripos of 1890. He\nhas been awarded the diploma of the Ecole Pratique (Paris) for a\ndissertation on \" La Survivance du Culte des Animaux au Pays de\nGalles.\" He is a good French and German scholar and published in\n1899, \"The Naval Wordbook: Ein Marine-technisches Wortenbuch.\"\nFor the last twelve months he has acted as Assistant Secretary of the\nAnthropological Institute, whose methods of research have many points\nin common with our own.\nMR. LANGLEY ON THE FIRE-WALK.\nBY ANDREW LANG.\nI DO not wish further to engage in controversy with Mr. Langley,\nnor he with me. As to the calculations in his article in Nature\n(August 22, 1901), I observed elsewhere that his most important figure\nwas \" conceivably a misprint.\" It was a misprint.1 Without being\npolemical I may note that the exhibition witnessed by Mr. Laugley\nwas that of a strolling performer; and that the religious rite of the\nFire-Walk (as I conceive a rite of First Fruits) is not indigenous\nin Tahiti (where Papa-Ita2 was on tour), and was not performed in\nthe regular way. The furnace was one time, not seven times heated,\nthat is, did not burn for a seventh of the time usual in the religious\nceremony of Fiji. Unlike some other European observers, Mr. Langley\ndid not try the surface temperature of the stones with his own bare\nfeet. A recent observer, Mr. George Ely Hall, gives the following\naccount of his experience. I am obliged, for the present, to cite it as\nquoted^by Miss Teuira Henry, in the Journal of the Polynesian Society,\nVol. x., No. 1, pp. 53-54, March, 1901. Miss Henry, a lady of\n1 The account in Nature gave the specific gravity of the stone as 0'39 ; it should\nhave been 2 '39.\n2 Mr. Lang tells us that there was a good account of Papa-Ita, with photographs,\nin The World Wide Mai\/azine for June, 1901.\u2014ED.\n\fNov., 1901.] Mr Langley on the Fire Walk. 133\nPolynesian extraction, communicated an excellent account of the\nreligious rite to the same journal, with the incantations (Vol. ii.,\np. 105).\nMiss Teuira Henry, of Honolulu, sends us the following notes on the\nabove subject, which she first brought to the notice of the Society in her\npaper published in Vol. ii., p. 105, under the title of \" Te-umu-ti.\" Further\nreferences to the performance will be found in Vol. viii., pp. 58 and 188.\nThe following is quoted from The Sunday Examiner Magazine, San\nFrancisco, of December last : \" But now comes Mr. George Ely Hall, the\nTurkish Consul-General, with an office in Parrott Buildings on prosy Market\nStreet, in unimaginative San Francisco, and tells how he, only a few weeks\nago, with the commander of a modern French cruiser, was enabled through\nincantations and the fanning of sacred leaves, to walk bare-footed over\nred-hot stones, and come out unhurt. But more than this, Consul Hall has\nphotographs to prove his story, and the ' apparatus ' cannot lie.\"\nThe French cruiser was the Protet, the commander was Commodore\nGerminot, and the itmu-ti walking was done on the Island of Taha'a,\nadjacent to Ra'iatea, Society Group. When all was made ready and the\ngreat hot stones were flattened down, Mr. Hall says : \" Then out came\nthe two sorcerers,1 each armed with a big bundle of leaves of the sacred ti.\nThey set np an incantation, a weird chant that started the tremulous little\nquivers in the spinal marrow, and began beating the edge of the fire with\nti leaves. The people stopped all their laughter and chatter\u2014there was no\nsound save the chanting of the sorcerers, who moved slowly and with rapt\nfaces. I began to feel a strange impression in it all, and if one of the old\nwoodland gods had stepped out of the cover in response to the incantations,\nI should not have felt great surprise.\n\"Then, still moaning and muttering, those two sorcerers started across\nthe hot stones with bare feet, beating ahead of them with long ti leaves.\nThere was no trace of hurry in their steps ; Milton's Satan, walking across\nthe burning marl, could hardly have been more majestic. Then some of the\nnatives, men and girls, prepared for the test. The sorcerers walked over\nthe stones ahead of them, beating the way with ti leaves.\n\"And then the interpreter announced that the Commodore and myself\nwould walk over the hot stones ; all the company shouted in great joy. We\nstripped off our shoes, rolled up our duck trousers, and took our places\nbehind the chanting sorcerers, who went on ahead of us again beating the\nstones with ti leaves. Then I wished I had not been so bold. All the heat\nI ever experienced was nothing compared to that. My moustache and hair\ncurled up so that I could not get them straightened for days ; ray hands\nseemed cooking ; in my ears was a feeling as if fires had been kindled\nagainst the drums ; my eyeballs seemed to boil out the water that ran\nfrom them. I felt like hurrying, but that would never have done in the\n1 These men were of course Polynesians, natives of the Society Group. \u2014EDITORS\n[of the Journal of the Polynesian Society].\n\f134 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1901.\npresence of that company and with those two sorcerers marching on so\nmajestically ahead\u2014and I would not have looked back for half the world,1\nsuch a hold had the earnestness of those heathen priests taken on me. But\nall this time my feet were cool, and we passed the ordeal unsinged and\nunharmed. I cannot explain how it was that I was not blistered in walking\nover the stones. There were scientists of some note among the officers of\nthe Protet, but they could not explain.\"\nThe paper says that it is a rule that no one may look back in walking\nthrough the umu, as has also been stated by Colonel Gudgeon (Vol. viii.,\np. 59).\nThere is now here in Honolulu a fire-walker from Huahine Island of\nthe Society Group, named Papa-Ita, about sixty years of age, who has been\nperforming before large audiences. His incantation is much the same as.\nthe Ea'iatean (Vol. ii., p. 105), but he invokes two famous women in their\nmythology, one of whom is the Vahine-nui-tahu-ra'i, invoked also by Tdpua\nof Ra'iatea, and the other is Hina-nui-te-'a'ara (Great Hina-of-sweet-scented\nherbs) who is no other than the famous sister of Ru the navigator and\nupraiser of the sky\u2014Hina of many titles, who is said to have stepped into\nthe moon and remained there watching over the earth ever since, for which\nreason she is also called Hina-nui-te-araava, Great Hina-the-watcher.\nThe unm-ti walking has never been a religions ceremony amongst the\nTahitians. Papa-Ita says it dates from time immemorial, and that the\nfeat is a mystery to themselves. They regard the ti {Dracaena) leaf as\nindispensable for the performance, because it constituted the clothing of the\ntwo women above-named. They wore wreaths, garlands, and petticoats of\nshredded ti leaves, and from them the habit has come down to these days.\nIt is thus obviously no peculiarity of the native feet that enables\nthem to walk unharmed. Europeans can achieve the adventure. But\nMr. Langley knew that before.\nCASES.\nL. 1126. Thought-transference by means of crystal-vision.\nThe following is a case of collective crystal-vision, in which there is\nno indication that the picture seen was derived from any source\nexternal to the minds of the percipients ; it seems rather to have been\na purely fancy scene, arising casually in the mind of one of them and\ntransferred, apparently by telepathy, to the mind of her companion.\nThe case is specially interesting on account of its bearing on the\ngeneral theory of collective hallucinations, since it indicates that the\nsharing of a hallucination by two or more persons is no proof that the\nhallucination had not a merely subjective origin ; and we print it\n1 A companion of Colonel Gudgeon, looking back, was badly burned.\u2014A. L.\n\fNov., 1901.] Gases. 135\npartly for this reason and partly in the hope that it may stimulate\nsome of our readers to try experiments on the same line.\nThe account was sent to us through the kindness of Mr. Andrew\nLang, one of the percipients, Miss Grieve, being a niece of his ; it was\nreceived on October llth, 1901. Miss Grieve writes :\u2014\nThe Leaseowes, Halesowen, Worcestershire.\nOn June 24th C. and myself were reading anatomy together. C. took the\ncrystal ball and I looked over her shoulder\u2014both of us merely wondering if\nwe should see the same thing. At the same moment the ball darkened, a white\ncloud came over the whole, and three pyramids appeared, a large one in front,\nthe other two behind. Then a train of camels, some with riders, others being\nled, passed from left to right and disappeared behind the large pyramid.\nThe vision lasted about one minute, and vanished simultaneously for both of\nus. We each wrote down as the things appeared, so as to be accurate ; and\nI had no thoughts of pyramids in my mind.\nB. H. GRIEVE.\nMiss Grieve's friend gives her own recollections of the vision as\nfollows :\u2014\nOn the 24th day of June, 1901, B. G. and myself were looking up muscles\nfor an exam., and we had the crystal ball on the table.\nWe both looked into it casually, and I at least had no definite thoughts in\nmy mind, when simultaneously we saw some pyramids appear, one large one\nin front and others behind, seemingly in a row, and coming round from the\nleft to right a train of camels appeared. On the first one was a man, whose\nfeatures I could not distinguish, as he was muffled up. Most of the other\ncamels had large packages on their backs and were led. The procession\npassed slowly round the pyramid and then all vanished.\nAnother day I was looking into the ball by firelight hoping to see a\nfavourite collie dog that had died a year previously.\nThe ball turned all black at first, then a light spot appeared in the centre\nand gradually spread nearly all over the ball. In the centre of this was a\ntrue portrait of the dog,\u2014perfectly life-like. The vision only remained a\nfew seconds.\nCATHERINE COAD.\nThe second vision described by Miss Coad seems to show a special\nfaculty on her part of vivid visualisation ; it was, therefore, especially\nimportant to ascertain whether any conversation took place between\nher and Miss Grieve during the course of the vision, which might have\nsuggested to her the same scene. In reply to questions on this point,\nand as to the notes made at the time, Miss Grieve writes to us :\u2014\nOctober nth, 1901.\n... I am sorry to say I cannot send you the rough notes we made at the\ntime ; we left them here (at the college) last term and cannot find them\n\f136 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1901.\nanywhere now. . . . The descriptions were written immediately after\nseeing the vision, but before either of us said anything, and we did not speak\nwhile the vision lasted. . . .\nBERTHA H. GRIEVE.\nMr. Andrew Lang gives in The Making of Religion, pp. 98-99, a case\nin which \" Miss Angus \" and a friend of her saw closely similar visions\nin the crystal. But from their accounts it does not seem certain that\nverbal suggestion was altogether excluded, as the seers did not entirely\nrefrain from discussing the visions while they were seeing them.\nMiss Grieve has sent us an account of another case in her own\nexperience, in which, after an examination in anatomy and before the\nresults came out, she saw in the crystal a list of names written on a\nsheet of paper. The first three names were clear, but the rest illegible.\nShortly afterwards she dreamt that the same three names were at the\ntop of the list ; and when the actual list came out the three first names\nappeared as in her dream. But as there were only ten candidates\naltogether, of whom Miss Grieve herself was one, she does not, of\ncourse, attribute any importance to this vision.\nP. 273. Apparition.\nIn the following case of premonition, the warning of approaching\ntrouble may possibly have been received from a discarnate spirit\u2014\nperhaps from the father of the percipient\u2014but it will be seen that there\nis no direct evidence of this. On the other hand, the circumstances point\nstrongly to the explanation that the warning emanated from the\nsubliminal self of the percipient, which may have been aware of the\ninflammation, which was probably already present, though the results of\nit were not consciously felt until the following day. The fact of the\nillness following so quickly on the impression of course bears out this\ninterpretation.\nThe account came to us through the American Branch of the Society,\nhaving been sent to Dr. Hodgson by Dr. M. J. Savage, who received it\nfrom the writer, Mrs. Meredith, of The Lilacs, Cedarhurst, Long\nIsland. The account was undated, but the postmark on the envelope\naddressed to Dr. Savage was May 25th, 1901. Mrs. Meredith wrote as\nfollows :\nOn Tuesday morning, the twenty-fourth of April, 1900, my son, Edward\nHoward Dunning, awakened me at about seven o'clock. He seemed much\ntroubled and spoke in a very deliberate and serious manner. He said :\n\" Mother, I'm afraid something terrible is going to happen ; last night a\n\fNov., 1901.] Cases. 137\nspirit walked before me, and I know what it means. Something terrible is\ngoing to happen. You will have to bear it.\"\nI felt myself quite dumb with amazement. I tried to argue with him and\nget a further explanation of what he had seen, or what he seemed to fancy\nthat he had seen. He persisted in repeating his fears, adding with ap\nparent pity for me, \" You will have to bear it.\"\nFurther details finally given me by him elicited these facts\u2014or what he\nclaimed to be facts. The previous evening while walking up and down the\npiazza of our home and about the grounds, smoking his usual after-dinner pipe,\nhe saw, or said that he saw, a spirit moving just before him as he walked. He\nsaid that it remained just in front of him until he finally turned to enter the\ndoor, when it remained standing by one of the pilLirs of the piazza. I asked\nhim if he recognised it, or I think I said, \" Who was it ? \" He answered, \" I\ncould not recognise it.\" He seemed to speak deliberately and with an\nevident desire to be accurate. I asked again, \" Was it a man or a woman ? \"\nHe once more answered, still with the same care, \" I think it was a man.\"\nHe then added, \" I understood its message.\" I asked, \" Did it speak to\nyou?\" For a moment he looked puzzled, then he slowly said, \"Yes -but\nperhaps not as you mean ' speak.' \"\nI tried to jest about the matter, but his strange seriousness filled my heart\nwith a nameless dread. His constant reply to all my jests and objections\nwas, \" Mother, I saw it.\"\nThis occurred first at about seven in the morning. Within several hours\nhe complained of feeling ill, and our family physician was called in, but no\nserious symptoms developed until the afternoon. That evening it was\ndecided that the case was a clearly defined one of appendicitis.\nMy son declared several times during the next two days the truth of what\nhe had told me just before the development of his illness. An operation was\nperformed on the second day. On the Sunday following, or on the 29th of\nApril, 19(X), he died at a half after eleven o'clock in the evening.\nI have tried to exercise great care in recalling this occurrence, copying\nnotes made not long after his death, and in no detail or statement have I\nexaggerated the facts.

It was written\u2014 or rather copied\u2014in May of the present year. The\norigiual notes, however, were made last summer\u2014a year ago\u2014soon after the\ndeath of my son in April of 1900. As I recall it, the exact dates of his\nillness and death are recorded in the account sent to you. . . .\nYou also ask if I object to the use of my name. Most certainly I do not,\nas I consider the testimony of my son a sacred legacy to all those who are\nseeking the truth in such matters.\nMy son had no previous belief in the existence of such phenomena. He\nwas what is called \"normal\" in the sense that physical health and sound\nnerves seemed to characterize him. . . . KATHARINE M. C. MEREDITH.\nMrs. Meredith adds, in a letter dated August 22nd, 1901.\n. . . When I asked him at the time if he had recognized the person he\nsaw, he replied, \"I could not recognize him.\" But my son was only six\nyears old when his father died, so if they had met after so long a separation,\nhe would hardly have recognized him at once.\nIn regard to the second question as to whether he realized that anything\nwas the matter with him at the time, I asked him at once \" Are you ill ? \"\nAnd he replied, \" No\u2014not ill\u2014but feel as if I might be coming down with\nthe grippe.\" No pain or actual illness developed until about three hours\nlater, when he looked at me with a peculiar expression and said, \"Mother,\nI'm getting such a pain in my side !\"\nI have often thought that whoever he saw, it must have been some one\nwho inspired no terror or even great awe, as he showed no fear or worry at\nany time, but seemed simply to accept the message gravely and with dignity.\nAbout a week before that he said to me one morning that no one could have\nbad a happier life than he had had, and added that he had no fear of death.\nHe said, \" Lots of people say that, but I mean it.\" A week later he proved\nby his great courage and calmness in the midst of terrible suffering that he\nhad spoken the truth. He was himself until the last moment, and the\n\fNov., 1901.] Cases. 1 ot)\nnurses said that aside from several brief intervals he, even at the last, had\nno delirium. After he could not speak he heard the doctor tell me that he\nthought he was unconscious. As an answer the boy made a great effort,\ntook me in his arms and clasped me close to his breast, trying 'at the same\ntime to kiss me. He was certainly unusually clear mentally until the last.\nKATHARINE M. C. MEREDITH.\nThe following letters from Mrs. Meredith, addressed to Dr. Hodgson,\ndescribe another occurrence in her family which is interesting in\nconnection with the foregoing :\nJune llth, 1901.\n. . . Yes\u2014in answer to your question as to whether there have been any\nother experiences in our family. My daughter Hazel at the age of two\nyears, and almost immediately after the death of her father, claimed to see\nhim, and carried on a conversation with him one morning in the presence of\nmyself and the nurse, who, of course, could neither see nor hear, as the\nchild certainly seemed to do. . . . KATHARINE M. C. MEREDITH.\nThe next letter was received on July 2nd, 1901.\n... As to the details concerning my daughter Hazel's conversation with\nher father, I can give that quite briefly. I do not know where I could find\nthe nurse who was present. Her name was Mrs. Hankin, and I think she\nhas gone to Chicago. As it occurred so many years ago, and as I lost track\nof her soon after, I fear I could never trace her. So I will tell you quite\nsimply what occurred.\nWhen my daughter was about two years old her father, who was devoted\nto her, died. Two months after his death, the child was sitting on the bed\nin the room which had been his, playing with some toys. The nurse and I\nwere packing his clothes away in some trunks. Suddenly the child began\ntalking and laughing with some one to us unseen. I asked her what she was\ndoing, and she looked innocently surprised as she replied, \" Talking to my\npapa\" I asked, \"Where is papa?\" She replied, as if astonished, \"Here.\"\nI said, \" Papa is not here.\" She insisted that he was, and pointed at him, as\nshe saw him at the bedside, with her finger. Then she said, \" Now mij\npapa's gone away '. \" Then added with burst of laughter, \" My papa wore a\nfunny dress\u2014all white .' \"\nShe then went on playing with her toys as if nothing had happened. She\nknew nothing of her father's death, had been away from home at the time,\nand had merely been told that her father had \"gone to heaven,\" which\nmeant nothing to her, as she was too young to understand.\nOf course, we thought it curious at the time, and spoke of it in our family\nmerely as an occurrence which was difficult to explain. The nurse alone\ninsisted tliat the child really saw what she claimed to see.\nNow\u2014after the experiences of the past year\u2014I regard the matter from a\ndifferent standpoint.\nOf course, as this occurred fourteen years ago, and no notes were made of\n\f140 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1901.\nit at the time by me, it is possible that I have not word for word used the\nexact language used at the time by the child. But it must have been very\nmuch as I have given it, and the main fact is absolutely true. . . .\nKATHARINE M. C. MEREDITH.\nL. 1127. Dream.\nThe evidence in the following case of a veridical dream has been\ncarefully collected by Dr. H. W. M'Connel, of Matlaske Hall, Norwich,\nan Associate of the Society. The principal witnesses in the case are\nall well known to Dr. M'Connel. Their names have been given us in\nconfidence, and all the original letters relating to the case were shown\nto us.\nDr. M'Connel drew up the following statement as the result of a\nconversation with Miss F. (the dreamer), and afterwards showed it to\nher to make sure of its correctness :\u2014\nOn February 26th, 1900, I dreamt that my brother passed sixth in an\nexamination for the Naval Medical. The letter with result came from the\nAdmiralty on the 28th, and the dream was found correct. The examination\nwas from February 19th-23rd, and I knew that my brother was up in\nLondon at it. I was in Edinburgh, and I had no reason for supposing that\nhe might come out any special place. The dream was between 2 a.m. and\n8 a.m. on the night of the 26th, and my brother only returned from London\non March 1st. I attached no importance at the time to the number in the\ndream, only feeling depressed at having dreamt he had passed at all, as\ndreams go very contrary ; but fortunately I told the dream that same\nmorning to my brother and sister and a friend. A. C. F.\nIn reply to questions from Dr. M'Connel, Miss F. writes to him :\u2014\nJanuary 10th, 1901.\n(1) R. was up for Naval Medical Service exam.\n(2) I had no reason for thinking he might come out any special place.\n(3) The exam, lasted Feb. 19th-23rd. I dreamt my dream night of 26th,\nand the letter with result from the Admiralty came on 28th.\n(4) Possibly might have been when marks were being added up, but not\nprobable\u2014dream occurring between 2 and 8 a.m.\n(5) R. only returned from London, March 1st. . . . As to how I dreamt of\nhis passing, I only knew I had had the list in my hand with R.'s name 6th.\n. . . Fortunately I told the dream, number ami all, that came morning both\nto F. and C. and a friend. I had a post-card from the latter afterwards\nsaying how very \"spooky\" it was. . . .\n\fNov., 1901.] Cases. 141\nMiss F.'s brother and sister, F. and C., confirm her account as\nfollows :\u2014\nJan. 21st, 1901.\nI remember A. told me she had dreamt R. had passed 6th in his exam.,\nwhich afterwards proved correct. F. H. F.\nI can also bear testimony as above. C. F.\nThe following extracts from later letters written by Miss F. give\nfurther details :\u2014\nR. did not know the result till I wired it to him on 28th. I am quite sure\nI don't know any of the examiners. ...\nI had no idea of the number of candidates. I knew nothing of the other\ncandidates. R. heard the result when I wired it to him after getting\nAdmiralty letter.\nOn looking up R.'s letters, I found his post-card written on the 28th,\nsaying, \"I got your wire this morning. I suppose it is so far satisfactory,\"\nand mentioning the fact that he had dined with a friend the previous night,\n27th. So I wrote and asked her if she chanced to remember whether R.\nknew his fate or not the night he dined, and she answers that she distinctly\nremembers that he was waiting then to hear the result.\nThe candidate in question (R.) could not remember the exact dates\nof the events, and as he was away on a cruise, no direct statements\ncould be obtained from him. But the letter just quoted, and the\nofficial statements which follow, seem to make it clear that he could\nnot have known the result of the examination at the time of his sister's\ndream, and that therefore, if she obtained the information telepathically,\nit could only have been from one of the examiners.\nThe letters of the officials to Dr. M'Connel, in reply to his inquiries,\nare as follows :\u2014\nADMIRALTY.\nJuly 2nd, 1901.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014In reply to your letter of yesterday, as far as is known in this\ndepartment, the result of the examination could not have been known\noutside before it was communicated here on Feb. 27th. The candidate in\nquestion would be the only one to say whether he obtained it, apart from the\nilreara, before he received the letter from this department.\u2014Yours very\ntruly, .\nThe gentleman who was acting as secretary to the Board of\nExaminers writes :\u2014\nJuly 2nd, 1901.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014The information which Mr. [of the Admiralty] lias given\nyou enables me to say positively that the meeting of the examiners took place\n\f142 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1901.\non the evening of Feb. 26tli.\u2014After determining the order of the candidates\nby numbers, the names (which till then are kept in a sealed envelope) would\nbe added to the list.\u2014This would be at about 7 o'clock p.m. on the 26th Feb.\nThe list thus made up would be in my custody till Feb. 27th morning, when\nI personally communicated it to the Admiralty. There is no possibility of\nthe result being known outside the circle of the examiners until after it has\nbeen communicated to the Admiralty.\u2014Yours faithfully, .\nOne of the examiners writes :\u2014\nJid\/\/ 4th, [1901.]\nDEAR SIR,\u2014I am afraid I cannot help you much. The meeting of the\nexamin'ers at which the results of the examination were determined was held\nat 5.30 on Monday, Feb. 26th, but whether the report was posted that\nevening or not I cannot say, as, to the best of my recollection, Dr. S., who\nacted on that occasion as Secretary to the Board of Examiners, took charge\nof the papers. ... I know of no way in which candidates can know before\nthe Admiralty is informed.\u2014Faithfully yours, .\nThe letter from the Admiralty announcing the result of the examina\ntion was posted to the candidate's home address on February 27th, and\nreceived in Edinburgh on the 28th.\nDr. M'Connel sent us a cutting from the Times of March 5th, 1900,\nwhich gives a list of the candidates in the examination of February\n19th and following days who had been granted commissions as\nsurgeons in the Royal Navy. Twenty names appear in the list, in\nwhich \" R.'s \" is sixth.\nIn reply to later inquiries from Dr. M'Connel, the Secretary to the\nExaminers says :\u2014\" I believe there were 28 candidates in the com\npetition in February, 1900.\" If Miss F. had been aware of this fact,\nthe probability of her guessing her brother's place correctly would, of\ncourse, have been one in 28. She states, however, that she had no\nidea how many candidates there were, and presumably knew nothing\nof her brother's chances. Thus, though it can hardly be stated that the\ncorrespondence between the dream and the facts was decidedly beyond\nwhat chance could have produced, it is certainly strongly suggestive of\nclairvoyance or telepathy.\nTHE NEWSPAPERS ON MRS. PIPER.\nMany of our readers will probably have seen the paragraphs in the\nDaily Telegraph and Westminster Gazette of October 21st and 25th\n\fNov., 1901.] The Newspapers on Mrs. Piper. 143\nand other papers, relating to the so-called \" confession \" of Mrs. Piper,\nwhich appeared in the New York Herald, and may expect us to notice\nthem. It will have been observed that Mrs. Piper is not alleged to\nhave made any confession of fraud ; she appears merely to have stated\nthat in her view the knowledge shown in her trance utterances is\nacquired through telepathy from the living and not through communi\ncations from the dead.\nIn a letter in the Westminster Gazette of October 25th, a member of\nour Council, Mr. E. N. Bennett, points out that this opinion can in no\nsense be regarded as a \" blow \" to the S.P.R., which\u2014as a Society\u2014\nis committed to no creed or theory, but simply attempts to aim\nimpartially at solutions of the problems presented to it. In our first\nreport on Mrs. Piper, the rival hypotheses of telepathy and spiritism\nas explanations of the facts were clearly stated ; and differences of\nopinion continue to exist on this matter among her investigators. Mrs.\nPiper herself is probably in a less favourable position than these\ninvestigators for forming a theory of the phenomena; but the\nadvocates of the spiritistic explanation can hardly object to her\ncautiously worded description of the possible sources of her information,\nas given in the New York Herald, namely :\u2014\"I never heard of anything\nbeing said by myself during a trance which might not have been latent\nin my own mind, or in the mind of the person in charge of the\nsitting, or in the mind of the person trying to get communication\nwith some one in another state of existence, or of some companion\npresent with such a person, or in the mind of some absent person\nalive somewhere else in the world.\" But as Mrs. Piper is no better\njudge than any other reader of the published reports of sittings with\nher, the question whether supernormal knowledge is communicated to\nher from the living or from the dead remains exactly where it was\nbefore her \"confession.\"\nWe may observe that the statement of the newspaper paragraph,\nthat Mrs. Piper \" announces her withdrawal from the Society,\" appears\nto be meaningless, since she has never been a member of it. It is also\nreported that she has determined to give up her sittings, but this,\naccording to the newspapers, appears not to be believed by Dr.\nHodgson. We have at present heard nothing but what has appeared\nin the papers on the matter.\n\f144 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

And in view of the large amount of fraud which\nadmittedly enters into the class of phenomena with which the Society\nis concerned, I should consider it unreasonable if the evidence were\nnot submitted to the severest tests, even should these involve \"sug\ngestions of fraud or even of credulity.\" And such a process ought\nto be beneficial not only to the investigators but also to the \"Artists.\"\n\"Artists\" have a greater right to feel annoyance when statements\nmade by them in trance have been deprived of their proper evidential\nvalue through laxity in the conditions, than to complain of the severity\nof methods through which alone a conviction of the genuineness of\ntheir phenomena can be brought to the minds of sceptics, who after\nall form the great majority of mankind.\nROSALIE THOMPSON.\nOCTOBER SOrn, 1901.\n\fNo. CLXXXIV.\u2014VOL.

Thomas, was also present.\nThe minutes of the previous meeting were read and signed as\ncorrect.\nFour new Members and seven new Associates were elected. The\nelection of thirteen new Associates of the American Branch was re\ncorded. Names and addresses are given above.\nA donation of \u00a35 from the Rev. Maxwell H. Close, in response to\nthe recent appeal by the Council, was reported.\nMr. H. A. W. Candler and Mr. Harold A.

Badelier, an\nAssociate of the Society who resided in India.\nThe resignation of two Members and four Associates, who desired\nto terminate their connection with the Society at the end of the year,\nwas accepted.\nSome presents to the library were reported, for which a vote of\nthanks was passed to the donors.\nThe names of the Members of Council who retire by rotation at the\n\fDEC., 1901.] Meeting of the Council. 147\nend of the year were read over.

LODGE, in the chair.\nA paper, communicated by MR. J. G. PIDDINGTON, entitled \"A\nRecord of Two Sittings with Mrs. Thompson,\" which it is intended to\npublish in the forthcoming Part of the Proceedings, was read by Mr.\nPiddington and Mr. N. W. Thomas. The sitter concerned was called\nin the paper by the pseudonym of Mr. J. 0. Wilson. He had brought\nto the sittings some objects belonging to a lady recently deceased, and\nthe communications of \"Nelly\" (Mrs. Thompson's \"control\")\u2014which\nwere partly relevant and partly irrelevant\u2014chiefly concerned this lady\nand some of her relations.\nSIR LAWRENCE JONES enquired how Mrs. Thompson's control\n.\" Nelly \" communicated with her.\nMR. PIDDINGTON explained that Mrs. Thompson sometimes goes\ninto trance spontaneously at her own home, and that her utterances are\nthen reported to her by her husband or some other person present\nin the room.\nMR, ADOLPHE SMITH enquired further as to the origin of the\n.control of \"Nelly,\" and expressed the view that the trivial nature\n\f148 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [DEC., 1901.\nof the communications made in Mr. Wilson's sittings tended to show\nthat they were mere examples of clairvoyance.\nMR. PIDDINGTON said that Mrs. Thompson had informed him that\nher trances had developed quite spontaneously, and that they had gone\non for five years before she had ever met a spiritualist or had any con\nnection with spiritualism. Her first control was not \"Nelly,\" but\n\" Mrs. Cartwright,\" a deceased schoolmistress.\nMR. F. W. THURSTAN explained the circumstances under which the\n\" Nelly \" control first appeared. Mr. and Mrs. Thompson were at his\nrooms, where he was holding \"development classes.\" Soon after Mrs.\nThompson came in, the trance developed quite unexpectedly, and\n\" Nelly \" introduced herself with the remark \" I'm Nelly.\" On a\nsubsequent occasion she reappeared and asked permission to speak, and\nseveral times she stated facts which were unknown to Mrs. Thompson\nin her normal state. Mr. Thurstan referred also to physical phenomena\nwhich had occurred in Mrs. Thompson's presence. With regard to the\npoint raised by Mr. Adolphe Smith as to the triviality of \" Nelly's \"\ncommunications, he observed that\u2014as Professor Hyslop had pointed\nout in his report on Mrs. Piper\u2014such trivial details afforded stronger\nevidence of personal identity than anything else.\nThe PRESIDENT emphatically endorsed this view. He went on to\nspeak of the need for further experiments in thought-transference, and\nurged on members the desirability of attempting work of this kind in\nfurtherance of the general objects of the Society. He mentioned a\nproposed weekly series of meetings of the Committee for Experiments,\na notice of which is printed below, and invited members who found\nthemselves successful in such experiments to aid in the study of the\nsubject by allowing the Committee to experiment with them. He\nthen referred to the recent newspaper reports of what had been\nspoken of in some quarters as Mrs. Piper's \" confession.\" This was\nnothing more than an expression of opinion on her part that the\nsupernormal knowledge sometimes possessed by her when in trance\nwas due to telepathy from the living, and not to communications\nfrom the dead. The newspapers had further alleged that she had\nbroken off her connection with the Society, and had determined to\ngive no more sittings. The President read a statement from Dr.\nHodgson showing that this was untrue. Mrs. Piper had already held\none sitting with him since the statement had appeared in the New York\nHerald (which had originated the reports about her), and she had then\nmade arrangements for future sittings.\n[A more detailed statement on this subject is printed below.]\n\fDue., 1901.] Proposed Experiments in Thought-Transference. 149\nPROPOSED EXPERIMENTS IN THOUGHT-\nTRANSFERENCE.\nALTHOUGH for several years past the Committee called originally the\nHypnotic Committee, and more recently the Committee for Experi\nments, have conducted experiments in thought-transference with many\ndifferent subjects, the results have not been either sufficiently sustained\nor sufficiently in excess of chance to make them worth publication.\nIn short, the Committee have failed to repeat the success attained in\nthe series of experiments conducted at Brighton in 1889-1892 by\nProfessor and Mrs. Sidgwick and Mr. G. A. Smith (see Proceedings,\nVol. VI., p. 128, and Vol. VIII., p. 536). This want of success might\nbe held (though not, they think, with justice) to throw doubt on the\nvalidity of the Brighton experiments. They believe, on the other\nhand, that it is really due almost entirely to the difficulty they have\nexperienced in obtaining suitable subjects for experimentation. Their\nsubjects have been drawn for the most part from an unintelligent or\noverworked class ; and while these proved suitable enough for simple\nhypnotic experiments, it is not unlikely that their failure in experi\nments which seem to demand concentration of mind, and at least some\namount of intelligent interest, was due to fatigue or stupidity. Most\nof them were irregular in their attendance ; some were not without\nmisgivings on the score of allowing themselves to be hypnotised :\nand all were easily bored.\nThe Committee, however, feel that they cannot allow themselves to\n.be discouraged from further efforts by the failure of experiments\nconducted under unfavourable conditions. They are therefore anxious\nto start as soon as possible a fresh series of experiments in thought-\ntransference ; and with this end in view, and in order to avoid having\nrecourse to clerks, waiters, and nondescript lads, they appeal to such\nMembers or Associates as may be good crystal-gazers or automatic writers\n(that is, who, as a rule, see pictures when they look in a crystal, or\nwrite automatically when they sit down with the intention of doing so),\nand are living in or near London, to offer themselves as subjects for regular\nexperiment. In the case of the subjects that were selected for frequent\nexperiment by the Committee, the Society would be prepared to pay\nwhatever expenses were necessarily incurred by them in connection with\nthe experiments. The meetings would be small and private and would\nbe held weekly at the rooms of the Society, 19 Buckingham Street,\nAdelphi, W.C. The dates and hours would be arranged to suit the\nconvenience of the persons concerned.\n\f150 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [DEC., 1901.\nRegularity and punctuality, and a readiness to submit to strict condi\ntions, are essential.\nMembers who are willing to offer themselves as subjects are requested\nto communicate with the Hon. Secretary,\nJ. G. PlDDINGTON, ESQ.,\n87 Sloane Street,\nLondon, S.W.\nIt is not proposed to introduce any hypnotic experiments\ninto the present series.\nTHE NEWSPAPERS ON MRS. PIPER.\nSINCE issuing the November Journal, a copy of the article on Mrs.\nPiper published in the New York Herald of October 20th has reached\nus. The first part of this is signed by Mrs. Piper herself, the second\npart consisting of comments and opinions on her case. The article\nbegins by saying that Mrs. Piper intends to give up the work she has\nbeen doing for the S.P.R., in order to devote herself to other and more\ncongenial pursuits ; and it goes on to say that it was on account of her\nown desire to understand the phenomena that she first allowed her\ntrances to be investigated and placed herself in the hands of scientific\nmen with the understanding that she should submit to any tests they\nchose to apply ; also that now, after fourteen years' work, the subject\nnot being yet cleared up, she feels disinclined for further investigation.\nAs to her own view of the phenomena, she says :\u2014\" The theory of\ntelepathy strongly appeals to me as the most plausible and genuinely\nscientific solution of the problem. ... I do not believe that spirits of\nthe dead have spoken through me when I have been in the trance\nstate. ... It may be that they have, but I do not affirm it.\" 1\nDr. Hodgson has sent us cuttings from two Boston papers bearing on\nthis report. The Boston Advertiser of October 25th, 1901, says that\n'The Editor of Light states in his issue of November 30th, 1901, that he\nhas received a letter from Mrs. Piper in which she \"explains that, having\nheard that the New York Herald people had, in a preliminary announcement,\nadvertised her name with the word 'Confession' above it, she at once forbade\nthe publication of the article altogether. The result was that she received a\ntelegram from the Herald counselling her to ' sleep calm ! ' and, assuring her\nthat the word 'Confession' had only been used in the way of 'advertising\nsmartness' and would not appear in the Herald article. This telegram Mrs.\nPiper has sent for our inspection and we have it still.\"\n\fDEC., 1901.] The Newspapers on Mrs. Piper. 151\nMrs. Piper dictated the following statement to a representative of\ntheirs :\u2014\nI did not make any such statement as that published in the New York\nHerald [quoted above] to the effect that spirits of the departed do not\ncontrol me. . . . My opinion is to-day as it was eighteen years ago. Spirits\nof the departed may have controlled me and they may not. I confess that\nI do not know. I have not changed. ... I make no change in my relations.\nThe Boston Journal of October 29th, 1901, says :\u2014\nMrs. Piper will continue her sittings according to agreement, and the\nrelations that have existed between her and the Society will not be broken.\nYesterday Dr. Hodgson saw Mrs. Piper and talked with her about the state\nment which appeared in the New Fork Herald. Afterwards both, by\nappointment, were seen by a Boston Journal reporter, and their statements\nagree as to future relations. Dr. Hodgson feels that the incident is closed,\nand Mrs. Piper, as will be seen from her statement, holds the same view.\nThe paper proceeds to give parallel statements by Mrs. Piper and\nDr. Hodgson, Mrs. Piper saying l :\u2014\nRegardless of whatever may have been said, I will go on with the present\narrangement with Dr. Hodgson and the Society, as formerly.\nI do not deny that I said something to the effect that I would never hold\nanother sitting with Mr. Hodgson, and that I would die first, to a New York\nHerald reporter last summer, when I gave the original interview ; but last\nweek I did not see a representative of the New York Herald, and did not\nreply to Dr. Hodgson. That is a misrepresentation, and furthermore, I am\nnot responsible for many of the former statements that the Herald published\nas coming from me.\nThe paper continues :\u2014\nThe next sitting, according to arrangements, will not be held for about\nthree months. Mrs. Piper still holds and expresses her view that the\nmanifestations are not spiritistic. . . . She feels that the telepathic theory\nis more probable than the spiritistic hypothesis. . . . There is no doubt\nof Mrs. Piper's perfect honesty in the matter. She is unwilling to have it\n1 The absurdity of ordinary newspaper reports on this subject may be illustrated\nby the following extract from the Liverpool Daily Post, of November 15th, 1901 :\n\" Mrs. Piper'K Latest.\u2014The American spiritualists have proved as hard to con\nvince as we conjectured they would when Mrs. Piper made her confession.\nThe Secretary of the American Psychical Research Society has, it seems, been\nexplaining to cultured Boston that Mrs. Piper's statement represented 'simply\na transient mood,' and he is apparently prepared to maintain her supernatural\npowers as firmly as ever. The worst of it is, however, that Mrs. Piper altogether\nrefuses to accept this suggestion, and stands by her confession. But even when\nthe prophet declares his own miracles shams, there will always be some people\nwho will refuse to believe him.\"\n\f152 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [DEC., 1901.\nappear that she believes herself capable of communicating with discarnate\nspirits, but she admits that the mysterious power is not easily understood or\naccounted for.\nNow, comparing all these statements together, it will be seen that,\nneither in the original report in the Herald nor anywhere else has any\nrevelation been made which could in any way affect the evidential value\nof Mrs. Piper's trance phenomena. Her honesty is not in question,\nand the Herald speaks of her throughout in highly laudatory terms. It\nrepresents her as holding a certain view of the phenomena\u2014a view\nwhich is really incompatible with the supposition that they are fraudu\nlent. Mrs. Piper's later utterances show that, although the Herald's\nreport was garbled and postdated, she still expresses a preference for\nthe telepathic over the spiritistic hypothesis. It is well known to all\nmembers of the S.P.R., and it is hardly necessary for us to repeat, that\nthese two hypotheses have always been kept before the minds of those\ninvestigators who have sat with her ; and since little value would be\nattached to her opinion in favour of the spiritistic hypothesis, it cannot\nfairly be urged that her opinion on the other side should weigh with us.\nMrs. Piper, in fact, as we have already said, is not in a more favourable,\nbut even in a less favourable, position for forming an opinion than those\nwho sit with her, since she does not afterwards remember what passes\nwhile she is in trance.\nOn the other hand, the allegation of the Herald that Mrs. Piper had\ndetermined finally to discontinue her sittings is shown to be unfounded.\nThe sittings had been suspended for some months owing to her health ;\nbut one was held, as Dr. Hodgson informs us, on October 21st (the day\nafter the article in the Herald appeared), and it was then arranged to\nresume them after an interval of three months.\nTo sum up, it is clear that Mrs. Piper has neither said nor done\nanything to diminish the value of evidence obtained through her, that\nthe report in the New York Herald was misleading, and that her rela\ntions with the Society and Dr. Hodgson continue on the same footing\nas before.\nOBITUARY.\nLioN MARILLIER.\nIN my friend Leon Marillier the world has lost a man of singularly\nvaried talents and extraordinary activity of mind. An \"agrege de\nphilosophic,\" he had already chosen for his own the domain of psycho\nlogy and ethics when the lectures of the late M. Sabatier drew his\n\fDEC., 1901.] Obituary. 153\nattention to the importance of the psychology of religion. From 1889\nonwards he lectured at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes on the\nreligions of uncivilised peoples, and it was after a lecture at the\nSorbonne that I first made his acquaintance. In 1896 he became one\nof the directors of the Revue de I'Histoire des Religions, and in the pages\nof this review is to be found some of his most brilliant work. His\ngenius was essentially analytic, and the consciousness of this led him to\ndevote to lecturing and reviewing the time which some of his friends\nwould like to have seen employed in the production of works of\nsynthesis. With the exception of his article on religion in La Grande\nEncyclopedic and one or two smaller treatises he never put forward his\nviews on primitive religion save in the form of a criticism of the work\nof others.\nOf his psychical research work I feel myself less qualified to speak.\nThat he was eminently fitted for this or any other work which\ndemanded sane judgment and exact methods is indisputable. To his\nacquaintance with psychology he added a knowledge of the exact\nmethods of biology, to which his contributions to the Annie Biologique\nbear eloquent testimony; he had gained under Sabatier a power of\ntextual criticism which made him a veritable historian ; he was\nendowed with a well-balanced judgment and a retentive memory, and\nof the perfect fairness of his mind no better proof could be given than\nthat at the outset of his career, though not a Protestant, he lectured at\nthe Protestant Faculty of Theology. His contributions to Psychical\nResearch were but few. An account by him of \" Apparitions of the\nVirgin in Dordogne,\" a sort of epidemic of hallucinations that took\nplace in the Dordogne in 1889, appeared in Vol. VII. of the Proceedings.\nHe was for a time secretary of the S.P.R. for France, and as such had\ncharge of the Census of Hallucinations in that country, and he shared\nwith others the task of translating into French Phantasms of the Living.\nTo his work in biology, psychology, and the history of religion he\nadded the functions of a lay missionary in the cause of social reform ;\nas an apostle of morality and justice he delivered many hundreds of\nlectures ; the numerous committees on which he sat never appealed to\nhim in vain.\nLeon Marillier fell a victim in the thirty-eighth year of his age\nto an illness contracted in consequence of a boating accident on the\ncoast of Brittany last August, in which his wife and thirteen of her\nrelatives lost their lives. In him has passed away an upright man, a\ncharming friend, 'and a conscientious seeker after truth.\nN. W. THOMAS.\n\f154 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [DEC., 1901.\nFIRE-WALKING IN MAURITIUS.\nThe following account has been sent to us by an Associate of the\nSociety, Mrs. G. S. Schwabe :\nRoyal Hospital, Chelsea, S.W.,\nNovember 5th, 1901.\nThe following account of fire-walking, as still practised in Mauritius, may\ninterest some of your readers. The population of the island of Mauritius\nconsists almost entirely of coolies from India; some from the neighbourhood\nof Calcutta and some from the Madras Presidency. It is the latter who\ncarry out the fire-walking ceremony, and although not countenanced by the\nGovernment in India, in Mauritius it is carried out under the supervision of\nthe police, who see that order is kept, that no women take part in the\nceremony, and that children are not carried through by their fathers. I\nwas twice present at the ceremony, in 1896 and 1897 ; it takes place on the\n1st of January in an enclosure belonging to a small temple at the village of\nRose-Hill. This day is always observed as a holiday, and a large crowd of\nnatives collects, while a certain number of Europeans look on from under\nthe shelter of a slight shed of palm branches. The ceremony takes place at\nmid-day, and it then being midsummer, the heat is intense.\nA wide shallow trench about a foot deep, twelve feet wide, and fifteen\nyards long is prepared beforehand, and on it are placed large piles of wood\nwhich, when I arrived on the last occasion, were still burning fiercely ; we\ntherefore had to wait till the piles had burnt down and became masses of\nred-hot embers. Some men then came with long wooden rakes and raked\nthe embers until they were spread over the whole surface of the trench to a\ndepth of several inches. The radiant heat given out was so great that it\nwas almost unbearable where we stood at a distance of several yards from\nthe trench.\nA young goat was then brought .to the edge of the trench, its head severed\nwith one stroke of a sword, and the body dragged swiftly round the furnace\nas a sacrifice to the goddess Kali. This did not occupy more than a few\nseconds, and the devotees at once advanced, led by the priest of the temple.\nHe, like the others, was entirely naked with the exception of wreaths of\nflowers and leaves round neck and waist, and carried a kind of raised plateau\nof flowers in his hands. He stepped boldly on the embers, walked slowly\nfrom one end of the trench to the other, pausing once or twice to turn round\nand round as in a dance, and having reached the other side, stood there\ncalmly awaiting the others, and holding the flowery erection above his\nhead, a fine and picturesque figure. He was closely followed by the other\ndevotees, some twelve in number, who crossed in turn ; two or three looked\nas if wound up to the deed by religious frenzy, and one as if under the\ninfluence of bhang or similar narcotic, but the majority retained their\nordinary aspect, and none showed signs of visible suffering. Two or three\nwomen in yellow draperies rushed forward, but were seized by the police\nand removed after a violent struggle. Just beyond the further edge of the\n\fDEC., 1901.] Fire-Walking in Mauritius. 155\ntrench a small pool, or rather puddle, of water lay on the ground, and some,\nbut not all, walked through it on coming out of the trench.\nI cannot offer any explanation, nor does it seem possible to understand,\neven if the hardness of feet that are never shod is taken into consideration,\nhow it was that the thighs and stomachs of the men were not badly burnt\nand blistered. I was assured by a gentleman that his own servant had\nwaited on him at dinner after walking through the fire in the afternoon.\nIt is nearly always done in fulfilment of a vow made to obtain the recovery\nof some sick relation, and the natives assert that under these circumstances\nthe fire never hurts.\nI regret that I cannot add the testimony of some medical or scientific\nwitness. I have written twice to Mauritius with this object but with no\nresult, but am now going to make a fresh attempt. I have heard it suggested\nthat the legs and feet were smeared with the juice of the aloe ; but there is\nno proof of this, and it seems unlikely that this could resist the intense heat.\nI noticed that the men who raked the embers had great difficulty in\napproaching near enough to effect their object, although the rakes were\npurposely of great length. The police magistrate is always present, and in\ndiscussing it afterwards I never heard it suggested that the performance\nwas not genuine. I ought, perhaps, to add that no payment of any kind\nwas asked for or made. MARY J. S. SOHWABE.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n[The Editor is not responsible for opinion* expressed by Correspondents.]\nFAITH.\nTo the Editor of the\nJOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nMAY I venture to suggest that the exception taken, both by Principal Lodge\nand Mr. Frank Podmore, to Sir Lawrence Jones' mention of Faith as part of\nthe necessary equipment for a progressing Psychic Besearcher, is probably\ndue to the fact that the word Faith has one meaning for Mr. Podmore\n(perhaps also for Principal Lodge) and another meaning for Sir Lawrence\nJones ?\nMr. Podmore says frankly that he defines Faith as \"belief in something\ninsufficiently proved or perhaps incapable of proof.\" This comes perilously\nnear the definition of the little boy who said, \" Faith means believing what\nyou know isn't true ! \"\nAt any rate, Faith would appear to be an undesirable possession for a\nscientific man in the eyes of Mr. Podmore, and even our justly-esteemed\nPresident seems to think the word has been in bad company, and may be\nliable to misapprehension.\nSurely this unfortunate idea arises from accepting the popular rather than\nthe true definition of this much maligned word. St. Paul's definition of Faith\nis, I think, on the whole, more truly scientific than the definition of Mr.\nPodmore. The former calls Faith the \" evidence of things unseen.\" This is\n\f156 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [DEC., 1901.\ndirectly opposed to Mr. Podmore's idea that Faith and Evidence are mutually\nexclusive.\nI venture to suggest that the Faith of which Sir Lawrence Jones speaks\nwith appreciation and enthusiasm is not credulity, nor is it even entirely\ncovered by Principal Lodge's alternative suggestion of \"open mindedness.\"\nIt includes this, but transcends it. I should say it was that attitude, not\nonly of the intellect but of the entire conscioiisness of man, which, accepting the\npossibility of obtaining evidence of things unseen, is willing to grant the condi\ntions deemed necessary for investigation of all supra-normal phenomena.\nWe allow a photographer to develop in a dark room when it is claimed as\na necessary condition ; we allow an experimental chemist the use of certain\ntemperatures, vessels, tubes, retorts, etc., which are necessary for his processes.\nWhy are we less willing to allow the necessity for suitable conditions for the\nproduction of phenomena of a much finer and more subtle nature ? Partly\nbecause we have not the Faith to believe in the possibility of such pheno\nmena, and partly because the moment any one speaks of mental conditions\nas affecting physical matter and physical effects, our thoughts fly at once to\ncharlatans and impostors. This is natural, but very deplorable from the \u2022\nscientific point of view\u2014deplorable, because, until we can rise above these\nunfortunate prejudices, our psychic science can only \"advance\" in a vicious\ncircle.\nI suppose the sternest scientist is aware that some men and women can\nblush 1 If emotion can affect physical matter thus far, is it not conceivable\nthat emotions and states of mind may affect matter in other ways also 1\nThere is nothing inherently absurd in such a supposition, when we see people\nblushing, and fainting, and growing hot and growing cold, every day of our\nlives, in response to mental emotions.\nEvery orator, every artist, every musician, knows that mental conditions\nmust be taken into account in the production of physical effects. And, after\nall, these people are human beings, made of much the same kind of flesh and\nblood as technical \"scientists.\" They are equally capable of giving an\nopinion within the limits of their own line in life.\nI think Sir Lawrence Jones would only plead that \"scientists\" should\nrecognise that there is a plane of mind and thought in which we are all\ndwelling even now, and which must be explored\u2014if at all\u2014by true scientists.\nThese must be willing to grant reasonable tentative suppositions as well as\nreasonable tentative conditions, without credulity and without abating one jot\nor tittle of their vigilance and judgment. They must be scientists who can\nconceive the possibility of things unseen and also the possibility of ultimately\ngaining (as the consequence of their \"faith and patience and sympathy\")\nevidence of those things unseen.\nThe only exception that I take to Sir Lawrence Jones' letter lies in the\nsentence, \" Up to now the task we have been engaged on has been a scientific\none,\" which might seem to imply that as we get further on, we are bound to\nbe less scientific ! If this were so, it would be a poor compliment to our\nresearches and a still poorer compliment to our science !\n\fDEC., 1901.] Correspondence. 157\nIt seems to be pretty generally taken for granted that scientific and in\ntellectual virtues cannot flourish in the same soil with \"artistic\" and emotional\npossibilities. If there were of necessity such a \" great gulf fixed,\" I fear it\nwould mean death to our research, for the \" artists \" would not consent to be\nled blindfold by the scientists, and most emphatically the latter would not\nconsent to be led anywhere or in any fashion by the \"artists.\" Fortunately\nwe have proof in Mr. Myers and Dr. Hodgson that it is possible to combine\nthe critical and sympathetic qualities in the same individual. But I think\nboth these gentlemen would freely admit that their attitudes of mind, and\nconsequently their methods of research, underwent very considerable modifi\ncation with increasing knowledge and experience. Also, I think, the con\nclusions they arrived at were thanks to their individual moral courage and\nmental elasticity rather than to the general working methods of the Society\nas a whole.\nIf evidence of this were needed, we have it in the fact that, in spite of the\nconspicuous advantages of over twenty years' association with the Society,\nMr. Podmore remains sceptical.\nThe S.P.R. has done some excellent detective work during the last twenty\nyears. It is perhaps a little in danger just now of thinking that it exists for\nthis negative work alone. It has toiled for many years in the admirable field\nof sifting the tares from the wheat. Sir Lawrence Jones seems to think it\nmight now do a little planting on its own account in the way of advanced\nexperimental work, and this can only be done to any good purpose by an\nexercise of that Faith which believes in the possibility of obtaining evidence\nfor \" things unseen.\" If this be credulity, then let us cherish it as the\nhighest virtue, for it is that quality of Faith which has won for Science all\nher victories in the past ! E. KATHARINE BATES.\n[Miss Bates maintains that the scientific investigator must be \" willing to\ngrant the conditions deemed necessary for investigation of all supra-normal\nphenomena,\" as we allow a photographer or a chemist to work under what\never conditions he finds necessary for his processes. No doubt some condi\ntions are necessary for the production of supernormal phenomena, and if we\nonly knew what these conditions were, we should all be willing to admit\nthem in our investigations. But the reason why we allow the phptographer\nor the chemist to choose his own conditions, and demur to the medium's\ndoing so, is that all photographers and all chemists agree as to what con\nditions are necessary in their case, and are in general able to explain the\nnecessity of them to any one who is sufficiently acquainted with the subject ;\nwhile not only do different mediums differ from one another as to the\nconditions which they allege to be necessary for their phenomena, but the\nsame medium at different times makes different requirements. Thus many\nof D. D. Home's phenomena occurred in brightly lighted rooms ; the general\npractice of physical mediums is to demand darkness ; some of Stainton\nMoses' phenomena occurred in the dark,\u2014others of apparently just the\nsame kind in the light. Eusapia Paladino at Cambridge refused any\n\f158 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [DEC., 1901.\nfastening ; the mediums described in Mrs. Sidgwick's \" Personal Investiga\ntion into the Physical Phenomena of Spiritualism\" (Proceedings, Vol. IV.,\npp. 45-74), generally allowed themselves to be fastened (though not in a\nmanner completely satisfactory to the investigators). These mediums were\nnot always consistent in their view of what was possible or impossible\nunder the circumstances. Thus (loc. cit. p. 61), the medium Haxby appeared\nat the opening of the cabinet, and with him what purported to be a\nmaterialised form. \"At the same time Joey [his control] spoke, having\npreviously informed us that it was impossible to do this while a spirit was\nmaterialised.\" Again, Eglinton generally objected to sitters imposing their\nown conditions to test the genuineness of his slate-writing, implying that\nthe \" spirits \" either could not or would not work under such circumstances\n(see e.g., Journal, Vol. II., pp. 294 and 301). On another occasion, however,\nthe \"spirits\" admitted that such an attitude on the part of sitters was\nnot an insuperable obstacle (Journal, Vol. II., p. 324). The practical result\nof all this is that in working with mediums, we may be obliged to allow\nthem to choose their own conditions, unless we can persuade them to submit\nto ours ; but we cannot discover which conditions are really essential, unless\nwe are allowed to vary them, and it is impossible for us to attach any value\nto results obtained under conditions which clearly admit of trickery.\nOn the other hand, in the case of the medium who has been subjected to\nthe most complete supervision and control\u2014Mrs. Piper\u2014better positive\nresults have been attained than in any other case on record. The advantage\nof this control from the medium's point of view has been admirably\n.expressed by Mrs. Thompson in a letter printed in the last Journal.\nMiss Bates at the end of her letter expresses a fear that the negative side\nof our work may become disproportionately large in comparison with the\nconstructive side. Our printed records of the last three years should be, we\nthink, sufficient to assuage this fear. Among them are : the second part of\nProfessor Barrett's monograph on the Divining Bod, embodying the results\nof several years' laborious research ; Professor Hyslop's Report on Mrs.\nPiper\u2014one of the most exhaustive hitherto published ; Dr. Morton Prince's\npaper on what is generally known as the most remarkable case of multiple\npersonality that has ever come to light ; and many minor discussions and\nreviews of importance, some expository and some critical. The contents of\nthe Journal during the same period have chiefly consisted, as usual, of\nindividual cases of apparently supernormal phenomena,\u2014printed as material\nfor study. EDITOR.]\nTHE Editor has been good enough to show me the above correspondence\nwith reference to Sir Lawrence Jones' use of the word \" Faith,\" in a\nsentence quoted from his letter in the October Journal : \" he that comes\nto the spirits must [have faith to] believe that they exist \" ; upon which\nMiss Bates truly says that the word \" Faith \" is ambiguous and may mean\nvery much or very little. The kind of faith connoted by the above\nquotation was rightly defined by Mr. Podmore ; but I agree with Miss Bates\n\fDEC., 1901.J Correspondence. 159\nin holding that any such definition is quite inadequate to describe Faith in\nits largest sense. She quotes with admiration the English version of St.\nPaul's poetic definition that it is \" the evidence of things unseen \" ; but to\na word with such a meaning as that, no investigator into occult phenomena\ncould possibly object, for \"evidence\" is precisely what he is laboriously\nseeking. Hence, since this is the ostensible foundation of Miss Bates'\ncommunication, it is not surprising that there is much in her letter with\nwhich every one can agree.\nOne word, however, as to her appeal for specified and fixed conditions\nwhile examining phenomena.\nThe Editor truly points out that one great object in varying the conditions\nis to ascertain which of them are really essential. It is bad experimentation\nto limit one's self to a fixed and crystallised set of conditions. It is\nappropriate to unintelligent repetition ; but it does not lead to discovery.\nTaking once more the hackneyed illustration of the photographer ; it has\nrecently been stated by Professor Nipher of St. Louis, that under certain\nexceptional conditions photographic plates can be successfully developed in\nfull daylight.1\nDiscoveries are made by departing from the traditional and the usual, and\nseeing what happens. And, whether discoveries are made or not, this course\nof procedure is in skilled hands more instructive than uniform adherence to\nthe beaten track of tradition.\nNo doubt Miss Bates will be able to accept this statement ; and thus, as\nusually happens in reasonable discussion, apparent differences of opinion are\nseen to resolve themselves into difference of emphasis and partial temporary\ninattention to one side or other of the whole subject.\nOLIVER LODGE.\nSUPPLEMENTARY LIBRARY CATALOGUE.\nAdditions since the last List (\"Journal\" for December, 1900).\nTHE EDMUND GURNEY LIBRARY.\n\" COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS : a Study in the Evolution of the Human\nMind;\" edited by Dr. Richard Maurice Bucke.2 Philadelphia, 1901.\nJASTROW (Prof. J.).

Dreams and impressions.\nWe give below an account, which was kindly obtained for us by Dr.\nH. W. M'Connel, of Matlaske Hall, Norwich, of a series of apparently\ntelepathic incidents occurring in the experience of a single percipient,\nMrs. B. It will be seen that the evidential value of these incidents\nvaries a good deal ; some of them are corroborated, but not all, cor-\nroboration being impossible in some cases owing to the impression not\nhaving been mentioned before it was verified. Mrs. B. seems also to\nhave had some impressions which were merely subjective ; other cases,\nagain, taken alone, might be regarded as merely accidental coincidences.\nThe value of the narrative depends rather on the cumulative effect of\nall the incidents taken together, for the total amount of correspondence\nbetween Mrs. B.'s impressions and the facts seems too great to be\nreasonably attributed to chance ; and it is interesting that so many\nveridical impressions should have occurred to one percipient.\nMrs. B.'s original narrative was sent to us by Dr. M'Connel, to\nwhom Mrs. B. and her family are well known, and it was through his\nefforts that such corroboration as is forthcoming has been obtained.\nAll the names of the witnesses have been given us in confidence, but we\nare requested to print their initials only.\n. The following is Mrs. B.'s account, which Dr. M'Connel tells us was\nwritten about a year ago at his request :\nTELEPATHIC EXPERIENCES.\n(1) Dec. 3rd, 1900.\u2014To begin with the last. On Saturday, August 19th\n[really 18th] of this year, I felt very low-spirited about G., and had a strong\n\f162 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1902.\nidea that he was in danger [in China]. This was about or towards noon and\nwent on for some hours. I saw in a few days in the papers that there bad\nbeen some disturbance on that date, and felt that he must have been in it.\nI wrote and asked him, telling him my thoughts. His reply (sent to E.)\nwas that the only fighting he had seen was on 19th August\u2014that there is\nabout ten hours' difference in time, which would make it night at Tiensin.\nBut all the same I believe I was reading his thoughts. He started on\nthe expedition at about 4 on Sunday morning, which was 19th August\nat Tiensin.\n(2) In, I think, Feb. 1889 (the dates can be verified by G.) G. went up for\nhis final examination at Woolwich. I was in Guernsey at the time, and on the\neve of the examination received a very depressed letter from G., telling me\nnot to expect Sappers, he was sure he would not pass out high enough.\nThen I had a vivid dream that he passed out eighth and got into the\nEngineers. I wrote to him, telling him \" I dreamt you were ' 8th Sappers,'\nand I expect it.\" In a few days or longer came his telegram, \" I passed\neighth Sappers.\" When he came home we compared notes, and he said to\nme, \" You dreamt that at the very time the examiners were adding up the\nmarks\u2014just as if you had been looking over their shoulders as they made\nout the list.\"\nI had previously dreamt the correct place G. came out in, at one of the\nminor Woolwich examinations.\n(3) Another curious dream was the following : G. went to Sierra Leone in\nOctober, 1891, and I think it was in March, 1892, I dreamt one of those\nvivid picture dreams that I could draw. I thought I was standing on the\nbanks of a tropical river, anxiously scanning a long boat, which slowly\napproached down stream. I was looking for G., but could only see three\nor four officers in kharki huddled up as if weary. Where was G. ? As the\nboat was punted closer I got a great start\u2014he was lying full length in the\nbottom of the boat, with his eyes shut, and looked pale. The boat stopped\nat my feet. G. opened his eyes, sprang out, and, catching me in his arms,\ncried, \" Don't be alarmed, dear mother, I'm as right as a trivet.\" When he\nreturned home and I began telling him my dream he stopped me. \" Let me\nask you questions,\" he said ; \" which way did the river run ? \" \" From left\nto right,\" I answered, \"and there was a kind of obstruction in the middle\nwith a tropical fern or something like a small tree growing there.\" \"Yes,\nyes, quite right,\" said G. ; \" but what kind of boat was I in ? \" \"A very\nlong black boat, such as I have never seen, with a flat place at the end where\na black man stood, punting with a particularly long pole.\" \"Yes, that is\nexactly the description both of boat and punting, man and pole, a very long\none, I remember. Also, I had been up all night before taking the Stockade\ntown of Tambi, digging a well, so I was dead beat, and while the others slept\nhuddled about, I was the only one lying flat on the bottom of the boat,\nsleeping like a log, and I only woke up to land.\"\n(4) I seem to get warnings also of illness and death to any of the family\nfrom a distance ;\u2014knockings, or that peculiar sound of the irregular winding\n\fJAN., 1902.] Cases. 163\nup of a watch. It will stop, then go on fast, or slow, and pause again.1 I\ncannot help being nervous now when I hear it. To begin with the last\ninstance. The night before E. [Mrs. B.'s daughter] returned from her visit\nto you [Dr. M'Connel] in October\u2014you will remember the date\u2014I was sitting\nalone by the fire reading when this curious, irregular kind of telegraph\nticking or winding began quite close to me. I said to myself, \" It is nothing,\na spider perhaps ; I will not listen,\" and tried to read. But the noise at\nonce grew more insistent, and made me so nervous, it was only by an effort\nI remained in the room. I looked at the clock\u20148.30 to 40. Next morning,\nI think\u2014but am not certain of exact hour\u2014at 12.20 came a telegram marked\nE. Opening it I found it was the cablegram from H. [the husband of E.],\nsaying he was invalided home. E. returned some hours late. I have never\ntold her of that noise, not liking to until H. was safe at home, because of\nanother occasion when I heard it before. If we could compare time we\nmay find either that the telegram was being written out at Pretoria or that\nH. was thinking of sending it.\n(5) That same winding or ticking noise I heard very distinctly early one\nmorning in March, 1896, at the head of my bed. I know now it was just as\nmy dear son.H. was taken ill in West Africa. I wish I had the exact date.\nSome days, or perhaps a week, before I had a very vivid dream about him.\nI told my dream at the time to Lady D. and her daughters, for I was staying\nthere. It was this. I thought I sat at a barrack table in the middle of an\nOrderly Room, as if waiting. A young sergeant who was, and yet was not, H.\nlooked in at the door. \" Where is H. ? \" I cried, frightened, and springing up.\nThe answer, given with a smiling face, was, \" Don't be alarmed ; they are\ncarrying him along all right. He has broken his leg. You cannot see him yet,\nbut you will by-and-bye.\" Then I awoke. I said to Lady D., \" I do hope dear\nH. is not ill, in any case I think that dream was sent to comfort me.\" She\nanswered gravely, \" I shall not feel happy until you have your dear boy safe\nback with you.\" He was taken ill while travelling with Sir F. C., the\nGovernor, and was left behind with the doctor. Being a little better and\nvery anxious to regain the Governor, to whom he was at the time acting\nA.D.C., he started before he was fit. He was carried in his palanquin, but\neven that was too much for him. He got much worse, and died at a small\nplace on the way, on the 4th April, 1896. When H. was a child of five at\nMalta he had his leg broken ; hence the idea in the dream. I was at\nFarnham on the day he died, Easter Eve, and between 11 and 12 a.m., as I\nwalked along the road alone, was thinking of him (I knew nothing of his\nillness). I was just saying to myself, \"How well I could fancy dear H.\ncoming along this road to meet me, his face and figure are so distinct in my\nmind.\" At that moment I heard him call me once, \"Mother,\" quite\ndistinctly, and something oppressed me daily until I heard of his death,\nwhich was not until the 22nd. All this is not fancy, but perfectly true.\nSomething within me seemed always saying, \" A dreadful blow is coming\n'Cf. some experiences described by Mrs. Verrall in the Journal, Vol. IX., p. 134,\nand p. 159.\n\f164 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1902.\nnearer and nearer,\" and on the morning of the 22nd that subtle sense said, it\nis at hand. A curious thing I had never seen before happened in the night\nof the 21st, on the eve of my getting the sad telegram. I suddenly woke\nand saw in front of me a bright light or radiance, very clear, more like sun\nlight than anything else. I was much startled, as I knew directly it was\nsomething unearthly, unnatural. I glanced at the windows, but they and the\nrest of the room were dark, and this brilliant flood of light on the wall\nfrightened and agitated me so much I hid my face and would not look any\nmore ; but I had looked long enough to be certain it was nothing I could\naccount for. The next morning the blow fell. E. and the B.'s all knew of it\nthe day before I did, the news having come through them. My sister was\nstaying with me at Farnham, and I told her of the strange light.\n(6) As I am telling you all, I may as well add another incident in connec\ntion with this dear son. In the autumn (September or October) of the same\nyear I and my sister were at Midhurst. I sat alone, copying out a journal\nthat H. kept in West Africa to send to G. in India. I had my left hand on\na page of the journal, and of course was thinking of H., when I was much\nstartled by a breathing over my shoulder as of some one about to speak to\nme. I got up and searched the room, and looked up the chimney, and\nlistened, but heard no more. It was a country place, very quiet, no one in\nsight. My sister can verify this, as when she presently came in I told her\nwhat I had heard. It was so distinct and unexpected a sound I was much\nstruck by it.\n(7) Once before I remember hearing myself called as already noted. It was\nin the night (about 1 or 2 of the morning) of the 5th July, 1892. Whether I\nwas half awake or wholly I cannot say, but most distinctly I heard E.'s voice\ncalling me, \"Mother, mother.\" I was in Guernsey at the time, and she\nat Cambridge. I felt nervous, and not the least surprised when a telegram\narrived about 10.30 or 11 that morning to say P. had appeared on the scene '.\nI took the next boat, and reached Cambridge very late the following day.\nE. greeted me with \" Mother, I wanted you so ; I called you aloud twice in\nthe night.\" \" I know you did,\" I answered, \" for I heard you call.\"\n(8) Of dreams which preceded the news of the death of two cousins I can\nremember one in which I saw, not the cousin who died, but a very vivid\npicture of her father. He had died when I was a small child, his face I had\nlong forgotten. I had not, I think, been thinking of the cousin ; it was very\nmauy years since I had met her. In a few days I heard she had died quite\nrecently.\n(9) The other dream was that I was lying on the sofa in the old schoolroom\nof my childhood when two figures appeared, standing close to me. One of them\nbent down and kissed my forehead, saying, \" We are both very happy where\nwe are, and you will be happy when you come to us.\" One of these appear\nances was that of a dear relation already many years passed away. The one\nwho kissed me was his cousin, always very fond of him. She was very old,\nbut I had not heard of anything wrong with her. I wrote to my brother,\ntelling him of this dream, and saying I expected to hear of the old lady's.\n\fJAN., 1902.] Cases. 165\n-death. In reply he said, \" A. D. has just died.\" Unluckily I cannot\nremember the dates of either the dreams or the news of death, but as far\nas I know it was not more than eight or ten years back, rand the dreams\nwere followed at once by the deaths, which probably happened at the -very\ntime.\n(10) I think it must have been in 1885, but the date can be verified, that\nL. B., being then a child, and I were talking one evening of her brother C.\nWe were alone, and she was telling me all about him and what a dear brother\nhe was. Suddenly she said, \" Aunt G., don't they say it is very unlucky to\ncall one baby after another 1\" I said it was a superstition, but why did she\nask it. She answered, \"Because C. is named after another baby brother C.,\nwho died.\" Her words gave me a shock, and I hastily said, \" You see it is\nonly nonsense, C. is grown up and perfectly well ; there is nothing the\nmatter with him.\" All the same I did not feel at all happy. The sudden\nnews of C.'s death while on the march in Burmah followed immediately.\nThis incident can be verified by my niece, who, as well as myself, were awed\nat the time to find by comparing hours that the brother must have passed\naway in Burmah while the sister was speaking about him at Brighton.\nThat same niece had a dream some years after, in 1891, about another\nbrother. For three nights running she dreamt he was drowned. Her dream\ncame true. He was thrown out of a boat in a flooded river, in, I think, the\nLowhai Country, and was swept away in the current and never seen again.\nThe family could verify L. B.'s dreams.\n(11) The following dream occurred so very long ago, but is still so vivid to me\nthat I insert it. My aunt was ill at the time and her daughter staying with\nus. It must have been in the early spring of 1856. I dreamt that I and a\ngroup of relations left a city behind us and walked in the moonlight to the\nsea close by. I saw that its waves were jet black, with crests of white.\nBeyond was a beautiful and shining island. My aunt bid us all farewell,\nstepped into the black sea, and as we all watched, she landed safely and was\nreceived by angels amid beautiful music. Another aunt, who may also have\nbeen ill at the time, and was ill three months and died, also then bid us\ngood-bye, and, turning to my mother, said, \" You trill be the next.\" There was\nnothing wrong with my mother at this time,1 but she was the next of that\ngroup to die, and then the young cousin, who happened to be staying with\nus at the time of my dream. Finally I was left alone on the shore, clinging\nto an older cousin. We had watched the others all cross to the island through\nthat dreadful sea. She said to me, \" We will go back to the city.\" She\nand I are the only ones who lived on for years after the others died. She\ntlied about seven or eight years ago, and is the one whose death I was fore\nwarned of by seeing the face of her father in the coffin. The curious part of\nthis dream is that each of that group died in the sequence foretold. I am the\nonly one left.\n(12) Another instance of hearing that telegraphic ticking was the day after\nmy eldest brother died. My other brother, a sister, and myself went over to\n1 She lived for three and a half years more.\n\f166 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1902.\nJersey for the funeral, and the first night I was there I could not sleep for\nthe loud and curious winding noise close to my head. I was very nervous,\nand thought it must be something my poor brother was trying to communi\ncate to me. At last I could bear it no longer and whispered as if to him,\n\" Dear F., please stop ; it frightens me so much.\" The noise ceased directly\nand was not continued. My brother was lying dead about four miles away\nin the country.\n(1) As regards the first incident in Mrs. B.'s narrative, she adds\nthat she had no reason for supposing that there was any fighting about\nthat time. Her son G. writes as follows, in reply to Dr. M'Connel's\nrequest for his confirmation :\u2014\nG. was in action (near Tientsin) on August 19th, 1900, Sunday\u2014from 6 a.m.\nto 10 a.m.\u2014danger not very imminent (intermittent and badly aimed fire).\nSimultaneous time in England would be, I imagine, 8 p.m. to midnight,\nSaturday, August 18tb. Mrs. B. wrote a few days after 19th and asked, had\nI been in danger on that date ? It is the only time I have been under fire\nduring this expedition.\nBut I cannot help thinking that the telegrams may have directed Mrs. B.'s\nthoughts to August 19th\u2014knowing me to be in the vicinity\u2014and having\nfelt low-spirited on that day (not uncommon), she was quick to impute the\ncause.\nThe following is an extract from a letter written by G. to one of his\nsisters :\u2014\nTientsin, N. China, Oct. 8th, 1900.\nA wet orderly has just brought letters\u2014or rather one letter\u2014from the\nmother [about her] perception of Aug. 19th. She calls it a Saturday, but it\nwas Sunday in this country, and the only fighting I have seen. The differ\nence in actual time between this and you is about 10 hours, so that by Ascot\ntime I was running about the field of battle between 9 p.m. and 1 a.m. on\nSaturday night. . . .

Do they work at night ?\n(e) Has G. any remembrance about the minor exam. ? Can he answer on\nthe same lines as above ?\n\fJAN., 1902.] Cases. 167\n(a) Regret that I cannot remember sufficiently well to corroborate. I\npassed out 8th, and remember Mrs. B. saying that she had dreamt it.\n(b) Cannot recollect.\n(c) One week between end of exam, and result. Exam, extended over\n10 days.\n(d) Might possibly have said this to please Mrs. B. Examiners might\nwork at any hour (time limited).\n(e) No.\nMrs. B.'s daughter, E., writes to Dr. M'Connel as follows :\u2014\n. June 3rd, 190.1.\nI remember mother had a dream about G. passing out 8th, and I think she\nwrote this in a letter to me, certainly before the result was known. What\nI am not very sure of is whether I was with her and she told me, or whether\nI was away at the time and she wrote it to me. I remember perfectly that\nthe dream was true. ... I am sure she told me or wrote it to me before the\nresult was known. ...\nIn reply to further questions from Dr. M'Connel about this dream,\nMrs. B. writes :\u2014\n(a) No. Neither of them preserved letters on subject. There wa\u00ab only\none, if I remember right, Mrs. B.'s to G., answered by telegram containing\nnews of result of exam. G. then came home.\n(b) Mrs. B. dreamt at night ; was generally in bed about ten ; is under\nthe impression that G. told her the marks were added up late.\n(c) Mrs. B. had one letter from G. in very low spirits. Whether exam,\nhad actually come off or not she is not positive. That letter from G. was\nprevious to her dream, and told her not to imagine that he would get\nsappers, for he was sure he would not.\n(d) The number 8 was strongly impressed OB Mrs. B. in her inner mind while\nasleep. She has no recollection of seeing examiners or hearing a voice in\nher dream. She dreamt that G. passed out 8th, and remembers nothing else.\n(e) Three or four days at the least, I believe.\n(\/) The night after exam, took place. She was thinking much about it\nas she knew it was happening.\nThe result of minor exam, at Woolwich was, if I remember, No. 49, and\n.was impressed on my sleeping consciousness in exactly the same manner.\n(3) With regard to Mrs. B.'s dream of her son in West Africa, Dr.\nM'Connel sent him the following questions, and his answers are\nappended.\n(a) Can ff. corroborate the incident here described ?\n(b) Can he imagine any reason why she dreamt of him ? Was he thinking\nof her ?\n(c) Was the incident a common one, so that the similarity would be merely\na coincidence (of dream and fact) ?\n(d) Did the dream happen coincident with the event, or before or after f\n\f168 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. {JAN., 1902.\n(e) Were the officers dressed in kharki ?\n(\/) Would G. catch the narrator in his arms naturally ?\n(ff) Is \" right as a trivet \" a common expression with G. ?\n(A) What wag date of occurrence of incident ?\n(a) Yes. Returning from expedition to \"Tambi,\" W. Coast Africa, in\nApril, 1892, we descended the Great Skarcies River in native boats. I was\nvery tired and sleeping, and I dreamt of my mother. (Only one night in boats.)\n(b) Tambi expedition was much in the papers about that time,\n(c) Incident uncommon.\n.

B.\nIn regard to the same incident Mrs. B. herself adds :\u2014\nMrs. B. cannot positively say if the dream occurred as the events happened\nor just before. When G. returned and we compared ideas, we concluded\nthat the dream was coincidental with his landing from river.\nThe officers in the actual scene, as well as in the dream, were in kharki.\nIt would be natural for G. to hug his mother, Mrs. B., when suddenly\nmeeting her after his being in danger.\n\"Right as a trivet\" was a favourite expression of G.'s in his youth.\nMrs. B. knew this, but never used it herself.\nNo. Mrs. B. never heard of intended journey by river. Never had any\ndescription of boat used on it.\nMrs. B. kept no diary or note of dream. Believes it was in March, 1892\nShe told dream to two sisters staying with her at the time. One is with her\nat present and appends note :\n\" I well remember my sister, Mrs. B., telling me this curious dream, the\nmorning after she had dreamt it, in March, 1892. M. P. de B.\"\nMrs. B. continues :\u2014\nMrs. B. has found letter of G.'s about the affair at Tambi, which she\nencloses. Her dream was previous to her receiving it, and would point to\nhave been a warning one before the actual scenes took place, and not, as G.\nand Mrs. B. thought, coincident.\nBut Mrs. B.'s memory is vague as to date of dream, though she is quite\ncertain it was not after the event.\nThe following is an extract from the letter referred to :\u2014\nS. LEONE, 16th April.\nI received two letters from you at Bobat on Wednesday morning. We\n\fJAN., 1902.] Gases. ' 169\nhad just returned from Tambi, and I was sleeping on the floor of a hut wait\ning for the boat to bring us here when the letters were brought on shore. I\nam sorry that you should be worrying yourself about nothing. I went up\non the expedition, and have returned very fit, havftig marched 113 miles and\nhad a little fighting.\nMrs. B. adds the following notes about some of the other inci\ndents described in her account :\u2014\nE. can corroborate about her calling for Mrs. B. [No. 7], and I should think\nas to about the time. P. came a fortnight or more before expected. Mrs. B.\nhad arranged to be with E. at the time of P.'s birth, and had no idea it would\ncome off so soon. Mrs. B. did not have any dream, and was, as it were, awoke\nout of sleep by E.'s voice calling her. Mrs. B. felt certain E. was in trouble\nof some kind, and naturally under the circumstances thought it probable,\nbeing now wide awake and nervous, that P. was arriving before the time.\nShe did not dream about any birth or anything at all before the voice came.\n[No. 4.] Did not keep telegram. It was to E., but as she was away Mrs. B.\nopened it. H. had been ill some time before. He might give date, I cannot.\nMrs. B., by the way, heard from E. yesterday, Jan. 21st, that she had seen\nCapt. A., who was with H. at Cape Town just before he embarked, and says\nhe was very ill then. H. will, I expect, be able to recall when he sent off\ntelegram.\n[No. 5.] In the instance of H. B., he was taken ill on 23rd March, 1896.\nAlthough Mrs. B. did not note the date of hearing that noise, she counted\nthe days after getting news of his death, and was struck with the fact that\nhe was taken ill same date as noise. The hour of his illness she never heard.\nShe listened to noise about 8 a.m. of 23rd March.\nMrs. B. writes again with regard to the fourth incident in her\naccount :\u2014\nJanuary 29th [1901].\nE. tells me that the cablegram about her husband's illness \" was sent by\nletter to Capetown\" (from, I think, Pretoria) by train, and then wired from\nthere, so it was several days on the way. But she does not mention the\nhour. However, the wire was on its way, either by land or by sea, or was\nbeing re-telegraphed from Cape Town, when I heard that curious noise.\nMrs. B.'s daughter E. writes to Dr. M'Connel with regard to the\nsame incident as follows :\u2014\nJanuary Zdth, 1901.\nAbout this last time of H.'s being invalided, he dictated the telegram to\nthe doctor in hospital at Pretoria on the Saturday, October 13th, and it was\nput into a letter with many others and sent by train to Capetown, and was\ngent off from Capetown on Tuesday early morning, I conclude, as it had that\ndate, 24th, upon it, and reached this in the afternoon of that day.\n. (7) With regard to the seventh incident, Mrs. B. writes :\u2014\nYes, I told the fact of having heard E. calling me to my sister and to G.\n\f170 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1902.\nBoth were with me when the telegram announcing P.'s arrival came. My\nsister affirms this (enclosed). No, I did not, I think, say anything to them\nbefore the telegram came, as I was very anxious aud unnerved at hearing E.\ncall me. This generally prevents my mentioning unusual things at the\nmoment, but when the telegram came in next morning I at once said out to\nthem I heard E. call me twice in the night.\nOn being questioned as to this incident, E. writes :\u2014\nYes, E. can corroborate the above exactly ; she did call out at that time.\nMrs. B.'s sister writes :\u2014\nI remember Mrs. B. telling me after the receipt of the telegram that she\nhad heard E. calling her during the night, but she had not mentioned it\nbefore it arrived. M. P. de B.\nG. 267. Clairvoyant vision.\nFor the evidence in the following case of an apparently clairvoyant\nvision we are indebted to Mr. W. W. Baggally, of No. 23, Lower Philli-\nmore Place, Kensington, W., a Member of the Society, who is acquainted\nwith the principal witnesses in the case and has full confidence in their\nintegrity. The percipient, Mr. John Polley, writes :\u2014\nAt a stance held within the sound of Big Ben on May 8th, 1901, there\nwere present Mrs. E. V. M., Mr. Thomas Atwood, and myself. As Mr.\nAtwood resumed his seat after delivering an invocation (about 8.30 p.m.), I\nbecame aware of a vision, which presented itself on the left of where I was\nseated. The scene appeared as being some 5 feet distant from me, and\ndisplayed part of the interior of a room, viz., that part where the stove\nstood. The fire in the stove was small and dull, and close beside it was\nan overturned chair. In front of the fire was something that looked like a\nfire-guard or clothes-horse, but this was not quite clear to me. Playing or\nclimbing over this article was a child, who fell forward, and, when it\nregained its feet, I noticed that its dress was on fire.\nI made no reference to the matter at the time, as I had an impression that\nthe vision might be connected with some occurrence in the family of Mrs. M.,\nand I was averse to mentioning it for fear of awaking sad memories.\nAfter some manifestations of movements of the table round which we\nwere seated the whole vision was repeated, and this time I had an un\ncontrollable impulse to speak. Upon my describing what I had just seen\nfor the second time, I was much relieved to hear that the matter was not\nrecognised as being connected in any way with the sitters. I may mention\nhere that the child appeared to be about three years old, and, judging from\nthe style of dress, I described it as a girl, although the vision would apply\nequally well to a boy, as, at that early age, the short clothes worn by both\nsexes would be very similar.\nNext Thursday morning, May 9th, 1901, upon awakening, I described to\nmy wife the events of the previous evening's stance. On the evening of the\n\fJAN., 1902.J Cases. 171\nsame day, viz., Thursday, May 9th, I was out with a friend, and upon my\nreturn home at 11.5 p.m. my sister, Mary Louisa Polley (who resided with\nme at that time), made the remark, \"I have a piece of bad news for you,\nJack.\" \"Well,\" I replied, \"what is it? let me know,\" and she answered,\n\"Brother George's little son Jackie has been burned to death.\" Like a\nflash I realised the connection of the sad event with my vision of the\nprevious night. I then asked her (my sister), \" How did you know this, and\nwhen V She replied, \"Mr. Fred Sinnett told me when he came over to see\nus this evening.\" JOHN POLLEY.\nThe other two sitters confirm Mr. Polley's statement as follows :\u2014\nAt a seance held on the evening of Wednesday, 8th May, 1901, at which\nwere present Mrs. E. V. M., Mr. Thomas Atwood, and Mr. John Polley, we,\nthe undersigned, testify that Mr. John Polley gave to us a description of a\nvision of the burning of a child which he saw at this seance.\n[Signed in full], E. V. M.\nTHOMAS ATWOOD.\nt Mrs. Polley writes :\u2014\n95 Church Street, Stoke-Newington.\nMy husband, Mr. John Polley, gave me, on Thursday morning, May 9th,\n1901, an account of a vision of the burning of a child that he had had at a\nseance at which he had been present on the previous evening of Wednesday,\n8th May, 1901. It was not till the evening of Thursday, 9th May, 1901,\nthat I or any other member of our family residing with us knew of the\ndeath, through burning, of our little nephew, John Frederick Polley. Mr.\nFrederick Sinnett visited us on the evening of Thursday, May 9th, 1901,\nand communicated the sad news to us for the first time.\nELIZABETH POLLEY.\nMr. Polley's sister writes as follows :\u2014\n95 Church Street, Stoke-Newingtou.\nI was quite unaware that any misfortune had occurred in the family of\nmy brother, Mr. Frederick George Polley, till the evening of Thursday,\n9th May, 1901, when Mr. Frederick Sinnett informed me that my little\nnephew, John Frederick Polley, had met his death on the previous day\nthrough burning. On the return home of my brother, Mr. John Polley,\nwith whom I reside, I communicated the news to him at about 11 o'clock of\nthe same evening of Thursday, 9th, 1901. ' MARY LOUISA POLLEY.\nA local paper, which Mr. Baggally has sent us, containing an account\nof the inquest, gives the date of the accident as Tuesday, May 7th.\nThe child was taken to a hospital immediately and there died. His\nfather, Mr. F. G-. Polley, a decorative painter, writes to Mr. Baggally\nin reply to his inquiries as follows :\u2014\n6 Adpar Street, Hall Park, Paddington,\nJune 19th, 1901.\nDear Sir,\u2014In reply to your inquiry respecting my late son, John Frederick,\nI beg to say that on Tuesday, May 7th, my wife went out to do some\n\f172 Journal of Society .for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1902.\nshopping, leaving my son, aged 2 years and 2 months, in a bed sitting-room\nwith another brother, aged 7. Whilst the elder brother was getting some\ntoys for them to play with, the deceased thrust some paper in the fire, pulled\nit out again, and set fire to his clothes. Some neighbours took him to the\nChildren's Hospital, Paddington Green, where he passed away on Wednes\nday, May '8th, at 11.45 a.m. No intimation of this was given by myself or\nany member of our family to my brother, Mr. John Polley, until a friend of\nthe family called at my address on Thursday, May the 9th, between 1 and\n2 p.m., when we informed him of the sad loss we had sustained, and he told\nus he intended calling on my brother that evening, and we asked him if he\nwould communicate the news to my brother and sister, who reside at Church\nStreet, Stoke-Newington. Of course you know, sir, I am antagonistic to\nyour views, but my brother has told me it is for the interests of science ;\nif that is so, I take great pleasure in its furtherance.\u2014Your sincerely,\nFREDERICK GEORGE POLLEY.\nIn a later letter to Mr. Baggally, Mr. F. G. Polley states that there\nwas a fire-guard in the room ; the little boy did not fall into the fire,\nbut set himself on fire as described above.\nMr. Baggally himself writes further with regard to the case as\nfollows :\u2014\nDecember 4th, 1901.\n\u2022 . . . Mrs. M. is not a medium and does not profess to have any mediumistic\npowers. Mr. John Polley is accustomed to have impressions of a so-called\n\u2022clairvoyant and clairaudient nature, so is Mr. Thomas Atwood, but they are\nnot public mediums. The vision referred to is not unique in the experience\nof Mr. J. Polley. ... If I recollect rightly I saw the father of the child,\nMr. G. F. Polley, on May 22nd, who handed to me the newspaper with the\naccount of the accident. A few days after he sent me his written statement.\nI obtained the written statements of Mr. J. Polley, Mr. Atwood and Mrs.\nM., and Mrs. Elizabeth Polley in June. The statement of Miss Mary Louisa\nPolley I did not obtain till November, hence the delay in sending the account\nto the S.P.R. . .

If they themselves are\ndiscarnate spirits, then they may be able to recognise and represent other\ndiscarnate spirits ; but if they are incarnate minds acting \" telepathically \"\nthrough the organism of Mrs. Piper, they may be mistaken concerning\nthe origin, or intentionally deceptive in their representation, of the items\nof information which come to them.\nDr. Hyslop says (p. 158) : \" But having recognised this circumstance,,\nit will be easy to realise their spiritistic import after being convinced\nthat fraud is to be thrown out of account.\" But in speaking of fraud,\nhe seems to limit its possibility to fraud on his own part, or on that of\nDr. Hodgson, or of Mrs. Piper, or\u2014at the farthest\u2014on the part of Mrs.\nPiper's \" subliminal.\" Of the latter he says (p. 178) : \" Of course, if we,\nassume that Imperator and Hector are the secondary personalities of Mrs.\nPiper, we have large enough powers of intelligent action assumed to make\nit all the more difficult to transcend the telepathic hypothesis.\"\nBut why need we limit the use of the telepathic power to the secondary\npersonality of Mrs. Piper? If it is conceded\u2014as it seems to be in this\nreport\u2014that Mrs. Piper has a secondary personality which is distinct\nfrom her normal consciousness, is it to be supposed that she is the only\nhuman being who is thus gifted ? And if it is possible for extraneous\npersonalities to use her organism for the transmission of messages\u2014as\nRector and others are supposed to do\u2014why may not these extraneous\nminds be the secondary personalities of other human beings ?\nThis would not by any means be an unheard-of supposition, as the-\nclaim to the possession of such powers by living men has been made in\npast ages and is still being made by Mystic Brotherhoods and Occult\nSocieties, right here in England and America, in the twentieth century.\nOf course we are under no obligation to accept without proof what these\npeople tell us of \"telepathic\" powers which enable \"one person to transmit\nhis thought or his sensation or his volition, over any distance, to another\nperson who has or can attain his psychic vibration\"; but, on the other\nhand, are we at liberty to claim: as proved, conclusions which depend\nfor their truth upon the falsity of what those people .assert, before we\nhave proved its falsity ? If by any chance the claims made by Mystics\nand Occultists in all ages should prove to be true in this respect, would\n\f174 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1902.\nit not make it just as \"difficult to transcend the telepathic hypothesis\"\nas it wquld be if we supposed the invading personality to be Mrs. Piper's\n\" subliminal\"?\nDoes not the assertion by many disinterested persons that this form\nof telepathy does exist, make it necessary that we should \"reverse the\nargument\" and \"suspend judgment upon the identity of the communicators\nother than the ' controls ' until some decisive hypothesis has been reached\nconcerning the latter \" 1\nEven if it should be proved in the end that the Imperator group are\ndiscarnate spirits, would it then be necessary for us to accept the\u2014to\nsome of us unbearable\u2014supposition that our dead are in the state in\nwhich they represent them to be ? Would not the fact that they are\nable to enter and operate through the organism of Mrs. Piper make it\nprobable that they are able to visit other human organisms which, in\nsleep, or abstraction, or hypnosis, or voluntary trance, may become sus\nceptible to their inroads? Would not this power make it possible for\nthem to thus obtain the information necessary for producing the semblance\nof personal recollection of names and events ? To make use of such a\npower for the accumulation of facts and then present those facts as proofs\nof spirit identity would of course involve deception, but would this de\nception be so \"archly fiendish as to baffle all hope of finding it either\nintelligible or finite in its capacities \" ? In what respect would it exceed\nthe deception which draws its dark trail throughout the history of Mysti\ncism and Occultism and Spiritism from time immemorial ?\nWe all remember, of course, that Rector in time past claimed the ability\nto examine records and printed books, and give out through the hand\nof the medium information thus obtained, and even to so impress the mind\nof the medium as to make him select from a shelf of xmknown books\nthe proper one for verifying the quotation (Proceedings, vol. xi., pp. 106-7) ;\nand that Mr. Myers' comment upon this feat was : \" It is plain that a\npower such as this of acquiring and reproducing fresh knowledge inter\nposes much difficulty in the way of identifying any alleged spirit by\nmeans of his knowledge of the facts of his earth-life.\"\nWe have an incident in Professor Hyslop's report which reminds, one\nof this claim of Rector's. The occurrence, and the care with which it\nwas verified, are discussed in Appendix III., Note 94, pp. 535-6. The\ncommunicator is supposed to be James M'Clellan, who, in speaking of\nhis father, John M'Clellan, gets him confused with an entirely unrelated\nJohn M'Clellan who is mentioned in the History of Greene County, Ohio.\nThe son gives, as incidents in his father's life, accounts given in this\nhistory which refer to the other man, and which occurred several years\n;before the father of James M'Clellan removed to Greene County. He\nalso mentions family names connected with the other M'Clellan family\nand not with his own. If records and traditions were being looked up\nby a stranger in search of evidential items, such a mistake would be\nintelligible ; but for a son drawing upon his own memory for events in\n\fJAN., 1902.] Correspondence. 175\nthe life of his father, it certainly is not so. Was it Rector, or some\nconfrere of Rector's, performing his old-time feat of reading records ? It\nwas Mr. Myers' opinion that the acknowledged use of such powers on\nthe part of the controls \"leaves us with nothing more than the word of\nImperator\" to prove that persons thus vouched for are really present.\nIs it not then our imperative duty to establish beyond question the\nreliability of Imperator? Would it be too presumptuous for us to ask\nfor the co-operation of Imperator in an attempt to demonstrate, under\ntest conditions, the truth\u2014for instance\u2014of his \" explanation \" to Stainton\nMoses of the phosphorus fiasco,\u2014\"the abortive attempt on the part of\nChom to make a light \" ? (Proceedings, vol. xi., pp. 44-46).\nWould not such proof of Imperator's truthfulness go farther, among\nAnglo-Saxons, towards establishing his prodigious claims, than would any\namount of \" bowing of the hand \" and capitalizing of the personal pronoun\nin token of the presence of a lofty intelligence?\nIf he is as \" lofty \" as an ordinary white man, he cannot refuse to\nstand by his record. And surely we who declined to investigate the\npsychical phenomena of Madame Blavatsky because her fraudulent physical\nphenomena discredited all that she might do, cannot consistently accept\nthe same psychical phenomena, when presented by the Imperator group,\nand neglect to enquire into their physical phenomena. A. L. BARKER.\nFAITH.\nWHEN the Editor remarks, a propos of my letter in the December number\nof the Journal, that \" all photographers and all chemists agree as to what\nconditions are necessary in their case,\" he misses entirely my point, which\nwas that in all tentative research (psychic or otherwise) the conditions are\nnot known, and can only be discovered as the result of patient investigation\nand numerous experiments under varying conditions. This applies to all\nadvancing knowledge, and is not peculiar to psychical research. Therefore,\nI think (considering our crass ignorance, mediums and sitters alike), it\nbehoves us in the first place to try to learn what are the most favourable\nconditions before talking too much about what conditions we are going to\n\"impose\" upon those who submit to our investigations. No one has\nacknowledged more freely and frankly than Dr. Hodgson himself how much\nhe has learnt in this way, and how absurd some of his earlier tests and\nexactions have appeared to him in the light of his own advancing knowledge\nand experience.\nThe Editor, in running over a list of varying conditions demanded at\nvarying times by different mediums (sometimes where \"control\"and medium\nhave differed in their views) has illustrated my point, for me admirably.\nWhere mechanical forces, definite substances, and definite quantities are in\nquestion, the conditions necessary may be agreed upon, as he says, and may\nalso be explained, as he suggests, by the expert to the lay mind. But where\nmoods and emotions have to be taken into account, and are all-important in\ntheir influence upon results, I fear we must be content\u2014if we take up this\nsubject at all\u2014to allow a very considerable margin for the personal equation\nin medium, in sitter, and probably in the third factor of our problem. I\ncan state from my personal experience that Dr. Hodgson has shown him\nself fully alive to this necessity in the case of Mrs. Piper. Hence his good\n\f176 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

The misfortune is that so few can see that in making this necessary\nallowance we are more truly scientific in spirit than those bornds individuals\nwho scent fraud the moment it is asserted that mental conditions and emotional\nstates must be taken into account in this special research. \"If you. can get\na certain result when the light is out, or when you are feeling harmonious\nand happy and capable, and cannot get the same result when physical and\nmental conditions are alike inharmonious, there must be trickery somewhere.\nWho ever heard of air not liquefying at a certain minus temperature\nbecause the experimenter had a toothache or had lost his temper?\" This\nsounds absurd, but it is literally the line of argument that lies unconsciously\n\" back of the mind \" of so many of us and causes half our failures.\nI would only, in conclusion, take one small exception to Principal Lodge's\nkindly remarks upon my letter. I cannot allow that my admiration was\ngiven to the poetic side of St. Paul's definition of Faith, unless he (Principal\nLodge) admits that the truest poetry is the most real that we know ?\nIt was the accuracy of the definition which I admired in the quotation.\nFaith in its legitimate sense surely presupposes the existence of the fact\nwhich justifies it. Anything less than this is not Faith at all, but specula\ntion, illusion, credulity, or superstition.\nWhen I spoke of Science winning her victories through Faith I meant\nexactly what I said, and was not thinking of those discoveries which have\nbeen made as the result of speculative experiments, undertaken sometimes\nwith no absolutely definite aim, but with the hope that something of interest\nmight result. I referred to those far higher achievements where the martyr\nof Science, through that quality of Faith, which we can only speak of\nalternatively as Divine Intuition, has known that a certain discovery, not\nyet in possession of the race, will be made some day. and has worked and\ntoiled, and too often starved, with that one aim in view. He may have\nbeen pitied, he has certainly been persecuted, abused, and jeered at in turn,\ntill one fine day (probably long after the seer himself is dead and forgotten)\nthe fact he knew by Faith has come to be the commonplace of our lives.\nFaith that is not some day justified by fact is not Faith at all. It is a\nmisuse of the word. \"He that comes to the spirits must have faith to\nbelieve that they exist\" may certainly mean, he must suppose it is just\nbarely possible that they exist, in which case it is not Faith, but speculation.\nI do not understand why I am credited by Principal Lodge, and\ninferentially by the Editor also, with having \"appealed\" in my letter\nfor \"fixed and crystallised conditions.\" I have pleaded for reasonable\nand for suitable conditions, but could not have suggested fixed conditions.\nOn the contrary, I distinctly said that they must be tentative under our\npresent limitations of knowledge. My remarks upon the need for positive\nas well as negative work applied specially to England. Out of the three\ncases quoted by the Editor, one is connected with a gentleman who lives in\nIreland, and the other two belong, I think, to the American Branch of the\nSociety. E.

[FEB., 1902.\nINTRODUCTION.\nThe study of the floating dust of the atmosphere has led to the\ndiscovery of important physical and biological truths. The study of\nthe motelike mental images that drift in idle moments across the field\nof consciousness may in the end prove to be similarly instructive,\ninasmuch as these involuntary creations of the brain often seem to\nserve as the nuclei for psychic phenomena of more complex grouping,\nBut the value of introspective observation depends largely on the\nconfidence that may be placed in the observer, and the experiences\nthereby obtained are of a very intimate nature. For these reasons C.,\nthe writer of the following pages, has to overcome some natural\nreluctance before submitting to the criticism of strangers facts which,\nperhaps, can be justly appreciated only by those who are well\nacquainted with him. Again, many of his cases owe their sole signi\nficance to their number, and if taken separately would be considered\nas very doubtfully supernormal. Even those that are stronger and can\nstand alone may not be perceived to have any important or immediate\nbearings. Slight incidents, however, are sometimes found to furnish\nuseful illustration in the construction of theories, just as little stones\noften fit well in the odd corners of big buildings. It may also happen\nthat other diffident ones will be encouraged by his example to make\npersonal disclosures that are far more remarkable than his own.\nC. is already in his fifty-third year. He is of a sensitive, but self-\ncontained, disposition. His sight is slightly dimmed by advancing\nage, otherwise his sense perceptions seem to be fairly normal. His\nmemory, which has always been more ready than retentive, is of the\nmixed type, but visual, and perhaps motor, impressions are retained by\nhim better than auditory. The interest he has taken for the last\nfourteen years in psychical subjects has led him to a closer inspection\nof his own mentality, aware, as he is, that those who would arrive at a\nclear comprehension of the subjective experiences of others must often\nseek for terms of comparison within themselves. In this self-examina\ntion he has met with surprises, such as would, no doubt, occur to other\nexperimenters if, indeed, they would take equal pains to watch and\nwait for exceptional mental phenomena.\nOne of C.'s earliest discoveries was that he had no decided tendency\nto any of the usual forms of automatism found in so-called medium-\nship : there were no clear manifestations in his case, either of external\nised vision, or of involuntary motor impulse ; no brusque shiftings of\npersonality, and perhaps no marked divergence from normal conscious\n\fFEB., 1902.] Mind Reading and 'Allied Phenomena. 179\nness. In his whole experience there was only one occasion in which\nthe mise-en-sdne of subliminal perception apparently passed beyond the\nlimits of normality, and that was when he was quite a little boy. A\nmemory that dates from infancy is of course subject to much doubt, but\nif a full account of C.'s experiences is to be given, the occurrence must\nbe related. He was in company with older children, who had crowded\ninto a bedroom, where a looking-glass covered with a towel stood on a\ntoilet-table. Some game was being played, in which he was too young\nto take part. In the midst of laughter each child in turn lifted the\ntowel and looked into the glass. Induced by curiosity, he also lifted a\ncorner of the towel and looked in. In spite of the fact that the glass\nwas covered, it apparently reflected the whole room ; but it showed\nthe bed in a position at right angles to its real position in the room,\nand in the narrow passage formed between the bed and the wall sat an\nold woman dressed in a mob-cap and a common old-fashioned cotton\ngown. She was rocking a cradle ; and as soon as 0. looked at her, she\nraised her eyes to him, and, half doubled with age, advanced towards\nhim with tottering steps. He was frightened, and let the towel fall.\nOn looking in a second time the whole scene was repeated, and again\nhe lost courage and allowed the towel to drop. It was in vain that he\nspoke to the other children on the subject of his vision ; they paid no\n.attention to him, and in all probability they did not share in his\nhallucination.\nThis experience, however, which belongs to a period of life char\nacterised by a proneness to illusion and hallucination, stands remote in\ntime from the colourless intuitions of a maturer age with which C.'s\npresent narrative is principally concerned. In fact, the impressions\nthat sometimes seem to reach him through other than normal channels\nare not in themselves very distinguishable from the weak imagery that\naccompanies his ordinary trains of thought. Hence his conclusion that\nthe direct transmission to the brain of images from other minds, or the\nreception by the brain of veridical messages of no recognised personal\nsource, is something quite distinct from the automatisms that sometimes\nbring such messages to the surface.1 Yet there is a special attitude of\n1C. speaka thus for convenience' sake. Owing to the standing difficulty of\n\u2022conceiving any direct interaction between immaterial thought and the material\nbrain, he is inclined to admit the spiritual body of Pauline psychology. If such a\niertium quid exist, it is probable that in supernormal communication thought is\ndirectly transferred from spiritual body to spiritual body, and only indirectly\nfrom brain to brain. In the case of telepathy from the dead the supposed agent\nlias no longer a material brain at his disposal, yet such nunciation is apparently\nthe same in kind as that between persons in the flesh.\n\f180 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [FEB., 1902.\nmind that is favourable in trying for thought-transference or other\ncognate phenomena : the gaze must be directed inward to the exclusion\nas much as possible of the objective world ; at the same time passivity\nmust be combined with alertness, for if the brain is sluggish, or somnol\nence supervenes, it is probable that nothing will result from the\nexperiment. This does not mean that the attention must be sharply\ndirected to the expected impression ; on the contrary, a certain vacuity,\nor even some slight pre-occupation with alien subjects, may be a favour\ning condition. Supernormal mental phenomena are not to be com\nmanded at will : they are always more or less spontaneous in their\nmanifestation, and even in experimentation they are apt to come as.\nsurprises. Yet when once the trail has been struck, it may be\nfollowed, for it often happens that one hit will bring others in its train.\nIn C.'s percipience the only connotation of the dim and ill-defined\nimages apparently referable to telepathic sources is that they frequently\nbring with them a certain intuitive conviction of their veridicality.\nThen again, they have no recognisable associations within the brain n\nthey belong to no immediately preceding ideational series and are due\napparently to no previous suggestion, unless in the case of those that\nimpinge on the consciousness in seeming answer to some mental\nrequest.\nWith such imperfect control it is evident that any regular exercise-\nof psychic faculties is out of the question. At some periods an inclina\ntion to experiment has been followed by successes ; at others C. has\nfelt that he would be unsuccessful, and has refrained from making\ntrials. Thus his experiences are often separated by wide intervals of\ntime, and are numerous only because they are scattered over a lapse\nof many years. It may be added that in his case supernormal percep\ntion has generally depended on the presence of certain intimate friends,\nand that the instances are few in which he has read the minds of\nstrangers. Under the circumstances it has hardly been feasible to keep\na record of failures. C.'s impression is that they are at least not more\nnumerous than the successes, and that they would be very few indeed\nif he would abstain from asking questions in the case of extremely\nfaint and doubtful mental imagery.\nBefore enumerating the incidents thus generally characterised, a few-\ncauses of error may first be insisted on. The phenomena supposed to\nbe genuine will afterwards be classified under the headings of \" Mind-\nReading and Thought-Transference,\" \" Clairvoyance,\" \" Telepathy from\nthe Living,\" and \"Telepathy from the Dead\"; but lest such a pro\ngramme should, in spite of the foregoing remarks, raise undue\n\fFEB., 1902.] Mind Reading and Allied Phenomena. 181\nexpectation, it must be repeated that C.'s experiences are almost\nentirely lacking in that objectivation that renders other cases so\nwonderful. They may for this very reason be all the more worthy of\nthe attention of the patient psychologist ; but they will probably excite\nbut a languid interest in the general reader. Taken together, they\nhave the weight of cumulative evidence, but, considered apart, many of\nthem would pass as no more than the results of chance coincidence, or\nlucky guessing.\nPSEUDO-PHENOMENA.\nTo chance, indeed, must be attributed much that the too credulous\nspiritist is disposed to lay to the account of busybodies in the other\nworld. Had C. supposed himself to be an automaton in the hands of\nguides or controls, his belief would doubtless have been fortified by the\nfollowing occurrences :\nWhile residing at White's Hotel, on the Tijuca hill, he once went\ninto the dining-room a minute or so before the hour for ringing the\nsecond dinner-bell. Having walked home he was very hungry, and, to\nbeguile the few seconds of waiting, he took from a bookstand an old\nvolume of Chambers's Miscellany. Then, with a distinct desire to find\nin it some apposite allusion to the circumstances of the moment, he\nallowed it to fall open on a window sill. The book, however, slipped\nfrom the sill. Before it reached the ground he caught it against the\nwall, and |in so doing doubled back some of the leaves. At the page\nopened, and just at the place marked by the doubling of the leaf, were\nthe words : \" ' Ye are welcome,' said the porter ; ' let us go now to the\nrefectory, for ye must be hungry.' \" As he was reading this the second\ndinner-bell rang.\nC. once made an official call at the Lyceo das Aries e Officios of Eio de\nJaneiro. He was kept waiting for nearly half-an-hour. At last, with\nsome bitter reflections on the dilatoriness of Brazilians in general, he\ntook from his pocket a German translation of The School for Scandal,\nand opened it at hazard. His eyes at once alighted on the following\nsentence : \" Du laszt auch entsetzlich auf dich warten.\"\nOther incidents that are prima facie supernormal are found to be\nultimately traceable to a normal source. It is well known to psychical\nstudents that memories apparently lost may reappear, even after the\nlapse of years, and that they are very likely to emerge into conscious\nness through some of the usual forms of psychic automatism. Thus C.\nonce sat down to table-tilting with a Spiritist friend, and obtained a\nPortuguese name, with the declaration that its owner had lived at a\n\f182 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [FEB., 1902.\nplace called Jurujuba. The contents of the message were not charac\nteristic of the sitters, but might well have proceeded from a man of the\nworking classes. Inquiries at Jurujuba established the fact that such a\nman had existed, and C. was at first inclined to believe that the case\nwas one of identity. But, many years before, his friend had superin\ntended the work of putting up telegraph lines in that place, and after\na time he vaguely recalled the name given through the table as one\nthat had belonged to an individual who had served under his orders.\nHere evidently the emergence of a latent memory must be supposed in\npreference to the less plausible hypothesis of post-mortem agency.\nOther more frequent causes of delusion are the sounds and sights\nthat impress the senses when the attention is otherwise engaged. The\nsubject is also not a new one, but it will bear further exemplification.\nLet a common case be supposed. A person is busily engaged in\nwriting late in the afternoon. The clock strikes, and he is apparently\nunobservant of it. By-and-by an awareness creeps upon him that it is\nnear dinner-time; and recollecting that the hour has already been\nstruck, he counts the strokes in memory, and concludes that it is past\nfive or past six, as the case may be. It may also happen that his\nattention is not immediately called to the time, but that at some later\nperiod he is reminded by a subliminal message that he was writing\nafter five or six o'clock. This information, standing in no apparent\nconnection with supraliminal memory, will then be easily mistaken for\na piece of intuitive knowledge.\nThe way in which unconscious percepts will sometimes report\nthemselves to consciousness in some subsequent pause of mental\nactivity is exemplified in the following instance : C. was once waiting\nfor the street car at Botafogo. He had been absorbed in some train of\nthought, when in a moment of passivity the word Loivenbrau forced\nitself upon his notice. Wondering how it could have occurred to him,\nhe looked round and found it posted up in two places in a brewer's\nadvertisement, which was then a new one. Doubtless the word had\nbeen read by the eye before the attention had leisure to examine it.\nIt would seem that in one case at least C. was made aware of a\nsimilarly latent impression by an externalised hypnopompic image. It\nwas a very hot summer's day. He was sitting alone in an upper\napartment of a business house. Here he fell into a doze, and on\nawaking he glanced across a well to the other side of the room. For\nthe fraction of a second he saw there a man wearing a straw hat pushed\nto the back of his head. The figure stood looking down as if examin\ning papers. The vision was too brief to be very distinct. It was\n\fFEB., 1902.] Mind Reading and Allied Phenomena. 183\npreceded by no dream, and it was gone the moment the percipient was\nfully awake. Later on he noticed that a person who for a time made\nuse of that apartment as a temporary office was accustomed to stand\nlooking down at his papers exactly in the same place and with a straw\nhat at the back of his head. The inference is that C. had seen him there\nbefore in some previous lazy moment, and that the image, belonging to\na special state of consciousness, was no more than the clothing of an\nemergent memory.\nNevertheless there are vagaries of the imagination that are not so\neasily explained, and that are possibly referable to more occult causes.\nOn the afternoon of June 15th, 1896, C. was alone, engaged in trying\nfor automatic script, when he seemed to realise, without the aid of\nthe senses, that an individual of thin angular frame with strag\ngling grey whiskers and dark greasy clothes was standing close behind\nhim. He experienced a movement of repugnance to the fancied\nproximity of this invisible being, and immediately the feeling of a\npresence passed away.\nAgain, on waking one morning before it was quite light, he external\nised the visual image of a dead colleague. The face, seen dimly as if\nin an enlarged photograph, wore an expression of sternness, which,\nhowever, was changed into a smile in answer to a mental protest on\nthe part of the seer.\nIn 1894 C. was staying at a plantation house in the State of Minas.\nOne evening he walked seven or eight miles across the country to the\ntown of Juiz de Fora. He was going up a long hill, and had nearly\narrived at the top when he vaguely imagined a man following him at a\nshort distance\u2014not directly behind him, but a little to his right hand.\nA sensation, which is best described as a seance feeling, suggested the\nidea of a ghostly presence. The loneliness of the place and the moon\nless night were perhaps favourable to such fancies; and yet C. was\nrather surprised that he should experience them on the open hill and\nnot in the dark wood that crowned the summit. Subsequently he\nverified, quite casually, that the very spot where he had been subject\nto these peculiar imaginings was popularly supposed to be haunted.\nIn these last cases it is impossible to discover whether the visionary\nconceptions of C.'s mind can, or cannot, be classed as the masquerading\nfulfilment of some preceding, though unremembered, suggestion. The\ncoincidence with a popular belief, above mentioned, points rather to\nreal spiritual perception. At the same time it must be remarked that\nhis abiding interest in things psychical may suffice in itself to give a\ncertain and determined shape to his waking dreams.\n\f184 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [FEB., 1902.\nIt sometimes occurs that spoken words are perceived as mere sounds\nwhich are only subsequently resolved into sense by a process of mental\ndigestion. This may be a case of nervous deafness, or of something\nunfamiliar in the voice or accent of the speaker which requires to be\ntranslated into the more familiar tones to which the ear is accustomed.\nThere is a possibility that, time having elapsed, such translation may\ntake place sub-consciously and that the memory may take stock of the\nmeaning evolved after its uncouth origin has been forgotten. Here\nagain information might be found lodged in the mind with the false\nappearance of having reached it through some supernormal channel.\nAnother subtle cause of mistaken impressions may be noticed in the\nprocess by which weak memories are converted into strong ones. A\ndream, a series of hypnagogic images, the percepts of absent-minded\nmoments, leave, as is well known, but faint and fading traces on the\nbrain. They are likely to be recollected only when there is a reversion\nto the state of consciousness in which they were perceived. If anything\nworthy of remembrance occurs in such psychoses, it must be made the\nsubject of immediate reflection in order that it may be fixed on the\nnormal waking memory. But even at this first rehearsal some of\nthe details may be altered, or may slip from the mental grasp, and\nthere is then an awareness that they have not been properly recalled.\nBy-and-by, after the case has been revolved in thought over and over\nagain, the element of doubt tends to disappear, and the mind may\nfinally become convinced that the facts occurred just as they are\nremembered.\nThe effects of expectant attention likewise find some slight\nillustration in C.'s experiences. Among his notes is one referring\nto the pain he once felt in the eye when, on going through a wood,\na twig threatened to return and strike him in the face. If a hand\nis held under the table at a dark sitting in the hope of perceiving a\ncold breeze or the touch of ghostly fingers, it is quite likely that the\nexpected sensation will be felt. There is an experiment which any\nperson may make who\nwishes to demonstrate\nthe ease with which mo\nmentary hallucinations\nmay be induced, even in\nnormal waking subjects.\nLet the hands be held\nno. i. up against the light, and\nthen, with forefingersand\n\fFEB., 1902.] Mind Reading and Allied Phenomena. 185\nthumbs pressed together, let them be drawn apart slowly as if to show\nthe length of a thread or a lady's hair. If the onlooker is at all\nsuggestible, he will probably catch a glimpse of a fine dark line\nstretched between the fingers.1 (See Fig. 1.)\nIn concluding the subject of pseudo-phenomena, a word or two\nmay be said on the suggestive effect of images already existing\nin the mind. Those that are tactile may easily be translated into\nvisual terms, and vice versa. The visualiser will habitually convert\ninto form and colour the impressions received through the senses\nof hearing and touch. In this case the taste of a fruit, the smell\nof a flower, will at once recall their appearance. The auditif, in\norder to recollect objects seen by him, must associate them with\ntheir names. Two curious cases of such involuntary shifting of\npercepts are found in C.'s notes.\nOn the evening of September 14th, 1898, he was going upstairs\nto tea, and was about to go out through an archway leading into\nthe garden. He extinguished the candle he was carrying and\nproceeded to open the archway door. As soon as he grasped the\nkey to turn it in the lock, its image was formed with some distinct\nness and persistence in the glare left in the eyes by the light of\nthe candle.\nOn the night of the 28th of November, 1894, while on the\nfrontier between sleeping and waking, he saw, as a hypnagogic\nimage, a plump hand with the forefinger\nand thumb held in the position shown in\nthe drawing ; and at the same time he\nfelt a sensation in the right shoulder as\nif he had been seized by the fingers thus\nvisualised. The arm to which it belonged\nseemed to come from the wall behind him. It must be noted that on\nthe occasion he was a guest at the house of some coffee merchants,\nand that a deceased partner of the firm was said to have had just such\na hand as the one shaped by C.'s imagination. Here it is probable\nthat, in spite of their apparent simultaneity, the visual image\nreally occasioned the sensation of touch.\nWith a little of the rounding brought by time and a little repetition\nfrom mouth to mouth, this is one of those cases that would soon grow\ninto a marvellous ghost story. It is just possible that the hand seen\nbelonged to a spirit\u2014but, then, how about the key 1\n1 To ensure success, a real hair should be shown first and then, as if for the\npurpose of comparison, an imaginary one.\n\f186 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [FEB., 1902.\nMIND-READING AND THOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE.\n(1) C. will now proceed to such of his experiences as have a more\ndecided right to be classed as psychic phenomena. It was, perhaps,\nabout 1891 or 1892 that he first discovered in himself some slight\ntendency to supernormal perception. One of his earliest notes refers\nto an incident of thought-transference, in which, however, he\napparently acted as agent and not as percipient. He had taken part\nin a series of seances at the residence of people living in that part\nof Rio called the Saude. One afternoon, at the hour of twilight, he\nsat talking with the woman of the house, and, & propos of spiritistic\nsubjects, he tried for the externalisation of visual images with some\nsuccess, for he imagined the carpets strewn with violets. In the\nmidst of this experimentation in came Senr. Vasconcellos, a spiritist\nmedium, who immediately exclaimed, \" What a smell of violets ! \"\nThere were no such flowers in the house.\nThe following cases, in which C. was the percipient, will call\nfor little, if any, comment, and may be simply enumerated in their\nchronological order.\n(2) At the time that he was taking the Census of Hallucinations\nfor Brazil, he went to Novo Friburgo, a health resort on the\nOrgan Mountains. His inquiries, made right and left, excited\nthe curiosity of the hotel-keeper at whose house he had put up.\nThis person wanted to know all about spiritism, and with great\nprolixity gave the particulars of the death of a son of his who\nexpired as he was holding him in his arms. C. asked mentally\nfor the lad's name, and immediately there came, with the characteristic\nPortuguese accent of the man who was speaking to him, the answer\n\" Carlos.\" This he noted in his pocket-book ; and as soon as\nhe could edge in a word, he put the same question aloud. \" Carlos \"\nwas the reply. The hotel-keeper was much surprised to find\nthat the name had already been written.\n(3) On May 30th, 1892, C. was present at a meeting of the Council\nof Public Instruction. By his side sat a certain Dr. Menezes Vieira,\nwho was appealed to on a question of school prizes. The words\n\" Cantos do Conego Schmidt\" (Stories of Canon Schmidt) flashed into\nC.'s mind in such a manner as to lead him to suppose that it was a\ntransferred impression. He knew that a small volume of children's\ntales having that title existed, but had no further knowledge of it.\nNevertheless, he thought of it rather contemptuously. Dr. Menezes\nafterwards declared that that book had occurred to him, and that\n\fFEB., 1902.] Mind Reading and Allied Phenomena. 187\nbook only, though without contempt. It is possible that this case\nwas one of mere casual coincidence ; but C. was inclined to regard\nit at the time as due to thought-transference.\n(4) One day in December of the same year, after some attempt\nat clairvoyance attended with successful results, a friend of his, Senr.\nUlysses Cabral, brought him a letter to psychometrise. He held it\nto his forehead and visualised the words \" Amiga Ulysses.\" No other\nletters were obtainable ; but soon the mental picture of a head was\nformed, which he conjectured to be that of the writer. The hair,\nwhich began so far back over the temples as to give almost an\nappearance of baldness in that region, was black and lustrous and\nwas parted nearer the middle than usual. At the sides it was sinuous\nand ended in curls over the ears. The nose was long and aquiline ;\nthe eyebrows were symmetrical ; the features regular. No beard was\nworn, and the face looked somewhat thin. C. could not distinguish\nwhether there was a moustache. For one moment only he caught a\nglimpse of the whole body. This description, so far as it went, was\nsaid to be quite applicable to the writer of the letter, with the\nexception of the colour of the hair, which was declared by Senr.\nUlysses to be reddish. It is most probable that these particulars, if\nnot due to lucky guessing, were obtained, not from the letter, but from\nthe mind of C.'s friend, who was an interested spectator of the experi\nment. The writer of the letter was a military man not known to C.\n[Incident omitted here of word corresponding to C.'s thoughts\nobtained through table-tilting.]\n(5) On November 27th, 1893, he called at the house of an intimate\nfriend, an English engineer then resident in Eio. The heat had been\noppressive, and he felt worn out with his day in town. As soon as he\ndropped into a chair, he closed his eyes in sheer fatigue. At the same\nmoment the picture of a suspension bridge was formed in mental\nvision. There was nothing in his usual cogitations to suggest this\neither directly or remotely. He inquired, therefore, of his friend\nwhether he was thinking of suspension bridges. The latter replied\nthat he was not, but that during the day he had been studying just\nthat subject. . . .\n(6) In spite of repeated trials C. never succeeded in developing\nautomatic writing. At the most, his hand does but scrawl such dis\nconnected words or phrases as straggle through the brain in idle\nmoods. Some five or six years ago he was seated one morning at a\ndining-room table where G., a Portuguese acquaintance of his, was\ndeeply absorbed in drawing a bouquet of flowers. Having nothing\n\f188 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [FEB., 1902.\nbetter to do, he took pencil and paper and waited for some subliminal\nmessage. He wrote \" Eduardo.\" \" Do you know any one called\nEduardo ? \" he inquired of his companion. The Portuguese naturally\nreplied that he had known several of that name. Then the word\n\" Coimbra \" was written. G. stated in answer to another question that\nhe might have known an Eduardo at Coimbra, but did not recollect it.\nAfter this unsuccessful angling, C. wrote \" Bahia \" and held his tongue.\nThen, without any immediate associations to lead up to it, he thought\nof the name of a German grammarian\u2014Madvig, but with the middle\nconsonants transposed as if it were Mavdig. With this word in his\nmind his hand traced rather automatically the syllable \"Mav.\" The\nfirst stroke of the M, however, was so faint that it looked like \" Nav.\"\nThis called to mind the Portuguese word for \" ship,\" so that finally\n\" Navio \" was written. Then came very unexpectedly the letter C,\nwhich doubtless from its association with the preceding word suggested\n\" Capitao (captain).\" The experimenter was now ready with another\nquestion : \" Did you not know Eduardo, a ship's captain ? \" \" Oh\nyes,\" replied G., too much occupied with his drawing to be surprised,\n\"he was a second father to me.\" \"You knew him at Bahia, did you\nnot ? \" \" Yes, I travelled with him on his vessel from Valencia to\nBahia.\" He then proceeded to tell C. that Captain Eduardo was at\nthat time an old man who had taken a great liking to him and that\nthey had established a business together in the town of Bahia. He\nthought that the Christian name was Eduardo, but he had entirely\nforgotten the surname. C. knew that G. had been at Coimbra and\nBahia ; but he had never heard any previous mention of Captain\nEduardo, and his knowledge of G.'s previous career was of the\nslightest. Apparently the word striving to emerge into consciousness\nwas really Navio. This, however, slipped into Mavdig, thus partially\nassimilating a name lying on the surface memory and containing the\nsame vowels as Navio in the first and second syllables. The error\nin the initial consonant was half corrected by accident, or by the\nautomatism of the hand ; and C., knowing well that \"Mavdig\" could\nproceed only from his own brain, stopped short in the middle of the\nword and then completed it in conformity with a right intuition.\n[Incident omitted here of C. obtaining \" fairly correct \" impressions\nof the personal appearance of a deceased lady unknown to him.]\n(7) In the next case C. apparently sensed the probable consequences\nof a project harboured in another mind. On Monday, July 10th, 1896,\nhe met two acquaintance of his in the street. One of them, a young\nman called Jofio Mello Barreto, at once exclaimed, \" Keep away from\n\fFEB., 1902.] Mind Reading and Allied Phenomena. 189\nme, you prophet of evil,\" or words to that effect. He explained that\nhe was smarting under a pecuniary loss, of which C. had given him a\nkind of warning. The fact was that on a previous occasion, while the\ntwo were taking coffee together, C. felt a strong aura, which, rightly\nor wrongly, he connected with the approach of a disembodied intelli\ngence interested in his companion. He had a very decided presentiment\nrelative to some future conduct of Senr. Barreto's. Speaking under\nimpulse, he told him emphatically to be very careful. He could not\nsay exactly in what way he was to be careful, except that it referred to\nhis own proceeding, possibly in some business matter. On the after\nnoon of that day the young man entered into a transaction that\nresulted in a loss of 6 contos of reis, which, even at the low rate\nof exchange which then prevailed, amounted to \u00a3239 in English\nmoney.\n[Incident omitted here of C.'s impressions, partly right and partly\nwrong, about a young girl in a hospital who was being visited by his\nfriend, Dr. Barcellos.]\n(8) On the evening of March 1st, 1898, C. was at home sitting out on\nthe verandah with Senr. Luiz Dias, a young Brazilian lawyer. A short\ninterruption to their friendly chat was occasioned by\nthe appearance at the door of Senr. Bias's wife, who K .\ncame to consult her husband on some ordinary sub- x^^-ii^Tl\nject. At this moment C. happened to close his eyes, \" * *\nand immediately the image of a neck with a stand-up F[r 3\ncollar and black necktie was formed in mental vision.\nThe points of the collar were turned down. Now there had been some\nprevious conversation on the destructive habits of the Brazilian barata,\na gigantic cockroach that frays collars and cuffs and gnaws holes in\ndirty linen. Beyond this there was nothing to suggest the image formed\nin C.'s brain. He, therefore, said to his friend, \" Estd, pensando em\ncollarinhos (You are thinking of collars).\" Senr. Luiz Dias confessed\nthat he was at that moment debating within himself whether on the\nfollowing day he should put on a stand-up or turned-down collar. The\ntemperature was high, he had to go to a very hot suburb, and he\nperspired very freely. It is to be noticed that the image that occurred\nto C. was a composite one\u2014that is, it effected a compromise between\nthe two different styles of collar.\nOn March 3rd, 1898, the following declaration was written in Portu\nguese in C.'s pocket-book : \" I have heard the translation of the note\nrespecting the collars. It is correct. (Signed) Luiz DIAS.\"\n[Incident omitted here of C. guessing the name of a dead child as\n\f190 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [FEB., 1902.\nJorge. The child's name was Paulo, but he had had a brother Jorge,\npreviously deceased.]\n(9) C. is a frequent caller at the house of Dr. Oliveira Menezes, a\nprofessor of physics and an interested student of psychical problems.\nOne evening, towards the end of 1898, when in company with this\nfriend, he gazed into the dark shade of a doorway and idealised, rather\nthan visualised, a face with white side whiskers, broad cheeks, and\nwhite hair. The head was very like that of the well-known Brazilian\nstatesman, Rio Branco, only the face was broader. This he described.\nDr. Menezes at once rose from his chair, and, opening an album,\nshowed C. a photograph corresponding exactly in appearance to the\ndescription given. It was the doctor's father.\nSuch occurrences as the foregoing, although here classed as mind-\nreading, leave a wide margin of doubt as to the agency really operative\nin impressing the percipient's brain. That which next follows in\nchronological order is more evidently a case of thought-transference\nbetween the living.\n(10) On the evening of January 21st, 1899, C. accompanied Dr.\nAlfredo Barcellos in a visit to the Sao Joao Baptista Hospital, Botafogo,\nand remained waiting in the entrance hall while the doctor was occu\npied in the ward. Being thus left alone with his thoughts, he desired\nto know on what kind of patient his friend was attending, and in\nanswer to mental questions he received apparent mental replies. The\nname \" Catherina \" first occurred to him ; but this was\nrejected for \"Carolina\" and its familiar form \"Carda.\"\nThen with great spontaneity \"14 years \" flashed into his\nmind. He imagined the face of a girl with straight,\nglossy black hair passing over the sides of the forehead\nand falling loose down her back. She had arched eye\nbrows and what may be described as a surprised look. As C. was trying\nto see a sick person, he figured the lower part of the face thinned with\nthe effects of illness. She was burning in fever ; she felt a loathing for\nfatty substances in her food; she had suffered from vomits. At the\nsame time a doubt entered his mind whether female patients were\nreally received in that hospital, and for a moment the mental image of\nthe girl gave place to that of a man with thick, light brown hair and a\nstiff, full beard, coming forward under the chin in a tuft. As soon as\nDr. Barcellos came out, C. told him what he had been doing and what\nhis intuitions were. The doctor heard him with surprise. \"Sent.\nC.,\" exclaimed he, \" you are indeed developing the telepathic faculty ! \"\nHe explained, however, that no women were treated in that hospital,\n\fFEB., 1902.] Mind Reading and Allied Phenomena. 191\nand that in a figurative sense it was his own brain that was burning in\nfever. He was much perturbed at a nascent admiration shown by his\neldest son Luiz for a girl called Carolina (and familiarly Carola), who\nwas 14 years old. In walking to the hospital his thoughts had been\nactively engaged in devising some means of putting a stop to the affair.\nThe percipient did not even know that such a person as Carolina\nexisted ; yet her real appearance agreed fairly well with his description\nof her, which would have been still more definite had he added that she\nhad rather high cheek bones and some peculiarity in her teeth. These\nlatter characteristics, mentioned by Dr. Barcellos, did not occur to him.\nThe second part of C.'s intuitions relative to the fever and its conse\nquences was tolerably correct, although misapplied to the girl. The\npatient visited was a man with lightish hair and a full stiff beard,\nsweeping forward under the chin. It seems that he had suffered from\nvomits, and it was quite probable that he felt a loathing for fatty sub\nstances in his food. In thus verifying his mental visions, C. received\nthe further impression that Carolina was a good, affectionate child, and\nthis appeared to be Dr. Barcellos' own estimate of her character.\nThere were reasons, however, why he desired that his son should\nbe dissuaded from taking any serious step, one of them being that\nLuiz was still a mere boy, and was far from having completed his\nstudies.\nDr. Barcellos appended to the note in C.'s pocket-book the following\nbrief statement : \" I have heard the verbal translation of the above. It\nis all quite true. (Signed) DR. BARCELLOS.\n\"21\/1\/99.\"\n[Two incidents omitted here : (1) a rather vague description by C.\nof a supposed \" control \" ; name guessed as Maria Eosa, the real name\nbeing Maria Amelia; (2) C.'s impressions as to the appearance and\nbehaviour of the dead baby of a friend, said by the father to be\ncorrect.]\n(11) One evening in the same year (exact date not recorded) C.\npaid a visit to a certain Major Daniel Vaz and his wife Dona Octavia,\nwho then resided at Mangueira, a suburb of Rio. Dona Leonor, a widow\nlady, whom C. then saw for the first time, happened to be present, and\nthe conversation fell upon her deceased husband. \"Ask her whether\nher husband's name was not Antonio,\" said C. to the major. The\ninquiry elicited an affirmative reply. C. fell again into a reverie, and\nthen exclaimed, \" Catita\u2014who was Catita ? \" Dona Leonor declared\nthat this not very common name had belonged to a friend of hers\nwhom she had lost sight of for twenty years. Neither the major nor\n\f192 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

A. G. Parrot. As he took coffee with them, he\nfelt the divining impulse upon him, and faintly imagined a kind of\nwave passing from one to the other just over their heads. \" One\nof you two has been in a storm at sea,\" he began. Both declared they\nhad passed through such an experience. He then directed his attention\nto Senr. Parrot : \" Had you not sacks of maize on board ?\" \" Yes,\"\nhe replied, \" a large cargo.\" \" The saloon of the vessel was dingy\nand looked as if it wanted painting.\" This was also confirmed. \" You\nhad a trunk with a rounded top, covered with short reddish hairs.\"\n\" Yes,\" said Senr. Parrot, \" it was covered with calf-skin (couro de boi).\"\nC. also spoke of a man whom he supposed to be one of the officers, but\nthe description was declared to be that of the captain. Asked whether\nthere were horses on board, Senr. Parrot answered that he did not\nrecollect whether they carried horses on that voyage. C., insisting\nthat the storm was a very heavy one, was informed that his intuition\nwas correct. It took place oif Paranagua, and the vessel was nearly\nlost. The percipient pictured the hairy trunk drawn out to the middle\nof the cabin in an oblique position. Inside it on the top of the\nclothes was a pipe, an article rarely possessed by Brazilians, who smoke\nin preference either cigarettes or cigars. These details were also said\nto be hits, with the exception that the pipe was Turkish and not the\nordinary short pipe imagined by C.\n(To be continued.)\n\fNo. CLXXXVIL\u2014VOL. X.

W. Barrett, Dr. J. Milne Bramwell, the Hon.\nEverard Feilding, Mr. J. G. Piddington, Mr. F. Podmore, Sir Augustus\nK. Stephenson, K.C., and Professor J. J. Thomson, F.R.S.\nThe President then said he had in his hands an audited statement\nof the Income and Expenditure of the Society during 1901, to which\nwas appended the Auditor's Certificate. These would as usual be\nprinted in the Journal. The President also read the main items of a\nStatement of Assets and Liabilities on December 31st, 1901, showing\na decided advance in the position of the Society during the year, no\naccount being taken of any increase in the value of the Library or of\nthe stock of Proceedings. This result is mainly owing to the response\nreceived from the Society to the special Appeal issued last summer.\nTurning to the position of the Society the President remarked that,\nnotwithstanding numerous losses by death and resignation during\nthe past twelve months, the total number of names on the list of the\nEnglish Society had increased during 1901 from 951 to 980. The\nnumber on the list of the American Branch had increased from 481\nto 532.\nThe President invited remarks from any Member present, but there\nbeing no response, he declared the Meeting closed.\nNOTE.\u2014It should be stated that at the Meeting of the Council held\nimmediately after the Annual Meeting, it was agreed to strike off the\nList the names of thirty Members and Associates who had either\nremoved or been lost sight of, or who had been only nominal members,\nfor two or three years. The number of names on the English list, at\nthe commencement of the present year, after deducting the resignations\nat the end of 1901, is therefore 950.\nMEETING OF THE COUNCIL.\nThe Council met at the close of the Annual General Meeting above\nreported. The President occupied the chair. There were also present :\nSir William Crookes, F.R.S., the Hon. Everard Feilding, Miss Alice\nJohnson, Mr. J. G. Piddington, Mr. St. George Lane Fox Pitt, Mr. F.\nPodmore, Mrs. H. Sidg'wick, Mr. H. Arthur Smith, Col. Le M.

Besides some of the usual sitters, there were present a certain\nSenr. Almeida and his wife Dona Amelia, whom C. saw that evening\nfor the first time. During a trance manifestation of rather doubtful\ngenuineness there were allusions to a deceased son of the lady, a boy\ncalled Gustavo. After the sitting C. guessed rightly at Gustavo's\nheight, and made a sketch of the lad's face. This was said to be like\nhim ; but as he imagined the hair to be black, whereas it was really\nlight in colour, he himself was not disposed to attach much importance\nto his intuitions. During a brief absence of the lady he remained\nseated at the table searching within his mind for some more satisfactory\nproofs of identity. It was then that the idea came to him of a\ncharacteristic mark with its exact locality on one of the cheeks. Now,\nGustavo was Dona Amelia's son by a first marriage, and Senr. Almeida,\nher second husband, did not remember him sufficiently to say whether\nC.'s guess was right or wrong. He called in his wife and asked\nher whether the lad had any mark on his face. She replied affirma\ntively, saying it was like a wart which she herself had over her upper\nlip. At the same time she laid her finger on one of her cheeks on the\nexact spot which C. had pointed to on his own face during her absence\nfrom the room. (C. neglected to note at the time which cheek was\nthus indicated.) Dona Amelia then requested the percipient to notice\nhow Gustavo carried his head. It is possible, but not certain, that\nsome vague intuition respecting this had existed in C.'s mind before\nhis attention was called to it. He replied to the lady's satisfaction by\ndeclining his head forward and to the right side. \" It was thus,\" said\nhe. Such an attitude was suggestive of a meek disposition, and the\nfurther assertion that Gustavo must have been gentle and courteous in\nmanner was declared by Senr. Almeida and his wife to be perfectly\ntrue. The percipient, who in some of these experiments is prone\nto imagine disembodied intelligences as the source of his information,\nsupposed that Gustavo was right there, and that he was well pleased\nwith the proofs given of his identity. From facts elicited during the\nsitting he knew that Gustavo must have died when already an\nadolescent.\n(14) C. rarely obtains telepathic impressions during regular sittings.\nIn the foregoing case it has been seen that certain veridical intuitions\n\f200 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAR., 1902.\nwere received by him after a seance had terminated and when the\nminds of the people present had relaxed from the tenseness of attention\ncalled by Brazilian Spiritists concentration. . . . The following instance\nof mind-reading, which occurred in the family circle of a certain Senr.\nGruilherme Vianna . . . was obtained in an interval of general mental\nrelaxation ; the conditions were not those of the ordinary Eio sitting.\n\" Constanta,\" the first wife of that gentleman, was supposed to be\nmanifesting through a trance medium. As the \" control \" conversed\nfamiliarly with the sitters, C. imagined her dressed in a loose peignoir,\nwith a lock of hair falling forward over one of her shoulders close to\nthe neck. She was holding a little dog in her arm ; and, if C.'s\nmemory is to be trusted, he thought vaguely of the dog as being\nmimosa. (This untranslatable adjective indicates prettiness and grace\nfulness in a small compass.) In answer to questions Senr. Vianna\nconfirmed C.'s description of the morning dress of his deceased wife,\nand recognised as characteristic of her the style of hair seen. She was\nvery fond of dogs, 'and had a little pet called Mimosa. A portrait of\nDona Constanga exists at Senr. Vianna's house, but neither the loose\nlock nor the peignoir are therein represented.\nSome time after this incident, in a visit to Senr. Guilherme Vianna,\nwho was in failing health, it occurred to C. that \" Constanga \" might\nwell be drawn in thought to her husband. He imagined her passing\nher hands over his forehead, and he described these as being long and\nthin. This was a decided hit, for, according to Senr. Vianna, she had\nremarkably long thin fingers.\n(15) When Brazilian friends meet in the street, and desire to pro\nlong their interview, they usually adjourn to a c.af6 and chat at one of\nthe small tables over a cup of coffee. It was thus that, on January 7th,\n1900, C. conversed once more with the Senr. Eaimundo Pereira e Souza\nreferred to in a preceding case. The latter mentioned that he had\nbeen active in the work of freeing slaves. He was about to call on an\nold abolitionist companion ; and the projected visit, it seems, reminded\nhim mentally of a certain Joaquim, who was a capitao do mato (captain\nof the woods) in the bad old slavery days\u2014that is, he was a man who\nlived by capturing fugitive slaves and restoring them to their owners.\nSenr. Raimundo said nothing of this passing memory, but it was\nperhaps Apropos of this that he referred to certain strange sensations\nand a kind of terror that sometimes came upon him when, his wife\nhaving gone to church, he found himself on Sundays alone in the\nhouse with the children. C. fell into one of his guessing moods, and,\nguided by the faint imagery in his mind, described a big negro about\n\fMAR., 1902.] Mind Reading and Allied Phenomena. 201\nFIG\nIn such\nsix feet in height, with broad shoulders and a deep chest. The name\n\" Joaquim \" occurred to him. The negro was thought of as bare-footed\nand bare-headed, and seemed to carry a stick or a whip in his right\nhand. He was very dark in colour. He wore a\nkind of shirt made of sackcloth. His trousers\nwere tattered. Both these and the shirt sleeves\nwere rolled up. According to Senr. Raimundo,\nthe description given and the sketch afterwards\nmade corresponded with the appearance of the\ncapit&o do mato whose name had been guessed, and\nof whose former existence C. now became aware\nfor the first time. Joaquim, however, carried a\nwalking-stick and not a whip. Senr. Raimundo\nand his companions had this man well beaten near\nthe house of a Captain Senra. It seems that the\nnegro rolled down a steep bank and was much\nhurt. As C. listened to this account he imagined\nthe man with his head broken and bloody. A\nyear or two after this assault\u2014about 1887\u2014Joaquim died.\nimperfect visualisation there is much that may be due to mere fancy.\nIn the beginning the percipient imagined that the face of the negro\nwore a sardonic grin. Perhaps the latter, who in his lifetime attributed\nthe beating to Captain Senra, had discovered after death who his\nenemies really were. Perhaps it was his drawing near to Senr.\nRaimundo in hours of solitude that caused the otherwise inexplicable\nfeeling of terror. Such were the conjectures of the moment. C. gave\nadvice in accordance with his impressions, and told his friend to pray\nfor Joaquim and ask pardon for what he had done. He was to talk\nto his companion on the subject. As he thus spoke he imagined,\nperhaps absurdly, that the hard smile had passed away from the\nnegro's face, and given place to tears.\n(16) On the afternoon of the same day C. went up the Paula Mattos\nhill to call on some new friends, Senr. Marcondes Rezende and his\nAmerican wife, Dona Louise Rezende. His coming had been announced\nsome half hour before his arrival, for a person of the household who\nwas very sensitive to telepathic impacts had written on a slate, \" Senr.\nG. vem vindo (Senr. C. is coming).\" In the evening Dona Louise\nchallenged C. to give her a description of her mother, who lived in\nNorth America. The guesses made were for the greater part correct,\nbut were too vague and unimportant to merit enumeration. After a\ntime C. thought of Murillo's picture of the Virgin and Child. He\n\f202 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAR., 1902.\nsupposed that a copy of this formed part of the belongings of Dona\nLouise's mother. He imagined it hanging on the wall of a dark bed\nroom beside a four-poster furnished with light curtains. He had an\nidea, not immediately spoken of, that the picture was set in a frame of\nsome dark-coloured wood, oval inside and square on the outer edge.\nVery vaguely some gilding or ornamental work was thought of in this\nconnection. Dona Louise could say nothing as to the kind of room in\nwhich the picture was hanging ; but that it existed, and was a favourite\none with her mother, she positively affirmed. It had been framed in\nfulfilment of a vow made in childbirth. It was set in walnut wood,\nand was probably ornamented with some gilding. Though the lady\nsomewhat hesitated as to whether the frame were not oval on the outer\nedge and square inside, yet she was inclined to believe that the descrip\ntion given of its shape was really correct. Her mother prized both\nthis picture and another of St. Rita very highly, and these two objects\nof Catholic devotion had accompanied her in all her moves.\n(17) It was about this time that a lady in England, being anxious\nthat her son, Mr. T., who was then stationed at Eio, should know\nsomething of Spiritualism, wrote to C., asking him to meet the young\nman, and take him where he might see some phenomena. C. went\nwith him to Paula Mattos, where some automatic script was obtained\nthrough the hand of Dona Louise. This was not satisfactory : Mr. T.\nhad lost a brother, of whose continued existence he would willingly\nhave received some proof. The medium, however, wrote under the\nimpression that he wished to receive a message from his father.\nMeanwhile C. obtained some inkling of the character and bearing of\nthe young man who had died. He imagined him with his head thrown\nback. He supposed him to have a certain swing of the shoulders in\nwalking, and to be one of those unceremonious persons who are prone\nto slap their friends on the back and hail them with, \"Halloo, Jack !\"\nor some similar expression. Mr. T. seemed to be struck with this\ndescription of his brother, and asked C. to give him the Christian\nname. On this point, however, the percipient's mind remained a\nblank. A rather full account of these proceedings having been sent to\nthe lady correspondent, she replied that C.'s impressions were quite of\nthe nature of a proof, as they exactly expressed the manners and\nbearing of the son she had lost. \" The swing of the shoulders,\" she\nsaid, \" used to be noticed when he was quite a little boy.\"\n(18) Attracted by the friendly simplicity of the Rezendes, and by\nthe beautiful Christian character of Dona Louise (now deceased), C.\nbecame a constant caller at their house after they had moved into his\n\fMAR., 1902.] Mind Reading and Allied Phenomena. 203\nneighbourhood. In their company he sometimes made successful\nguesses, of which he neglected to take timely notes. The following\ninstance of these must therefore be related from memory. One evening\nthe Rezendes were talking about Father Lopes, a priest with whom\nthey had lived on intimate terms at a place called Faxina, in the\nsouth of the State of Sao Paulo. While listening abstractedly to their\nrecollections C. became attentive to what was passing in his own mind.\nHe pictured an individual wearing a Turkish cap and a cloak tied\nunder the chin with strings. It did not at first occur to him that this\nvisualisation had any reference to the subject of conversation. Having\nmade a sketch in pencil of the head he had imagined, he passed it to\nSenr. Rezende, who covered it with ink, and then declared it was a\nperfect likeness of Father Lopes, an opinion in which Dona Louise\nconcurred. It may have been that C. was slightly guided in making\nthis drawing by one or two remarks made by his friends. The mental\nimage of a manuscript led him to conjecture that Father Lopes had\nhanded over to Senr. Rezende some legal document. He seems to\nhave been wrong on one or two minor points, but the greater part of his\nguesses were fully confirmed. The priest habitually wore a Turkish cap,\nand he had just such a cloak as the one described. These cloaks, it is\nsaid, are common at Faxina, but they are rarely, if ever, met with in\nRio de Janeiro. The Rezendes were much pleased with the sketch\u2014\nperhaps more so than was the seer himself. Before his death Father\nLopes had made Senr. Rezende a present of the title deed of some house\nproperty. The document was shown to C. on the occasion, and he\nnoticed that its style of handwriting was different from that which had\nbeen presented to him in mental vision.\n[Five incidents, here omitted, conclude this section of the paper :\n(1) C. sketches from intuition the portrait of a deceased priest, said by\nhis acquaintances to be a striking likeness; (2) he guesses correctly\nthat Dr. Barcellos' dead mother wore a mantilla and had a habit of\nstroking her side hair ; (3) he describes correctly a lady's dead husband\nand another person, whom she identifies as a friend of his ; (4) he guesses\ncorrectly that a barber, known for his charitable habits, is nursing a\nsick friend, with some correct details of the patient's condition; (5) he\nsucceeds in making a stranger, seated opposite to him in a street car,\nexecute a movement which he was silently willing her to perform.\nThe next section of the paper is headed Clairvoyance, but the\nincidents described are very slight and inconclusive. Some experi\nments were made by C. in trying to guess words in certain places\nin books; e.g. the 2nd word on the 12th line of the 12th page, no one\n\f204 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAR., 1902.\nknowing what the word was ; out of 31 experiments, 6 were successful,\n4 partially so, and 21 unsuccessful; but most of the words rightly\nguessed were rather common ones.\nA section on Telepathy follows, recounting a few instances which\nC. says he \" is inclined to regard as due to spontaneous telepathy.\"\nThese were emotional impressions coinciding more or less closely with\nthe deaths of relatives or friends, but in some of the cases (though not\nall) he was expecting the death, and it was only in these cases that the\ncoincidence could be proved to be close. He also gives a number of\ninstances where his thoughts were strongly directed to his friend,\nDr. Barcellos, either just before meeting him in the street or at a time\nwhen Dr. Barcellos was specially thinking or speaking of him.\nThe concluding section of the paper is headed\nTELEPATHY FROM THE DEAD.\n0. observes of the first experience he describes : \" It presents\nmuch that may be attributed to mind-reading or thought-transference ;\nyet if the hypothesis of post-mortem agency be admitted, it must be\nconceded that it also shows traces of telepathy from the dead.\" This\nexperience was as follows : In the early part of 1896, certain\napparently supernormal incidents having occurred in a series, he wrote\n\" from intuition \" that proof would soon come, and shortly afterwards\nfound the word \"Amor \" formed in lines of pencil dust on a card left by\nhim in a private drawer for the purpose of experiment. Later the\nword was spelt out by table-tilting at a seance in his presence, when he\nwas thinking about it, his hands not being on the table. On May\n22nd, 1896, he was introduced to Senr. Ismael Pinto, a Kardecist\nclairvoyant; he tried to make him think of the word Adeus, but the\nclairvoyant said he saw the word Amor. Immediately after this,\nC. went to have his hair cut at his usual hairdresser's, Senr. Santos\nGuimaraes, to whom he related the above. Senr. Guimaraes in turn\ntold him of some experiences of his own, one relating to an adopted\ndaughter named Maria, and the other in connection with the death of\nhis second wife. The account continues] :\n(19) C. listened to the above narratives with attention, at the same\ntime that he kept watch for any images or intuitions that might occur to\nhis own mind. He first had an idea that Guimaraes' wife was also called\nMaria, and this was afterwards found to be right. The name, however,\nmight have been suggested by the story of the girl with the basket [the\nadopted daughter] ; and as it was also a very common one among the\nPortuguese, he did not make it the subject of immediate inquiry. A\n\fMAR., 1902.] Mind Reading and Allied Phenomena. 205\nsecond guess was \" Amelia\" which was wide of the mark, unless,\nindeed, it was an approximation to \" Emilia,\" the name of Senr.\nGuimaraes' mother. C. then mentally asked for some proof of\nidentity ; and, seeing with more than usual distinctness the image\nof a diminutive white rose, he conjectured that such a flower was-\nplaced upon Maria Guimaraes as she lay in her coffin. At\nthe same time he recollected that white flowers were not cus\ntomarily employed when the dead person had been married.\nGuimaraes, however, affirmed that she had been covered with white\nroses. Another guess was that she was buried at a place called\nCatumby. This was not correct, and was no more than a\nsurmise founded on C.'s vague recollection of the fact that\nshe and her husband had lived in that neighbourhood.\nAfterwards he saw in profile the upper part of a face with\na very retreating forehead, full eyes and regular nose. This\nhe drew in outline ; and although the sketch was very\nincomplete, the barber did not hesitate in recognising it\nas a likeness of his deceased wife. C. sensed the influence\nas a happy one, and he felt justified in transmitting to\nSenr. Guimaraes the emotional message, <; Much affection.\"\nSubsequently he obtained a definite idea of the mouth and\nchin, so that the side view of the face was completed and\ndeclared to be correct, but when he filled in the rest of the head from\nmere conjecture and showed it to Senr. Guimaraes, the latter affirmed\nthat only the profile which had been obtained intuitionally bore any\nreal resemblance to the original.\nOn May 26th C. sat alone in his sleeping-room trying for automatic\nwriting. He wrote the name \" Maria\" and afterwards \" Guimaraes.\"\nHaving asked for further proofs of identitity, the experimenter sought\nfor an answer rather in visual terms than in the disconnected and\npartly illegible words traced by his hand on the paper. Thereupon\ncame dim fragmentary images of ships ; he imagined himself under\nthe bows of an ocean steamer ; then his vision was focussed for a\nmoment or so on a distant vessel thrown on her beam ends in a rough\nsea so that the deck was visible. He had an idea that she carried\nmany people on board. Immediately afterwards a boat with green\nbows was pictured coming up over a large wave. She was also full\n\u2014perhaps she was bringing away persons from the endangered vessel.\nThere was nothing vivid and decided in all this. The series was more\nlike the faint memory images of events far removed in time. Mean\nwhile C. had scrawled on the paper among much that was illegible the\n\f206 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAR., 1902.\nwords \" bornt\" and \"swound,\" probably misspellings of \"burnt\" and\n\" swooned.\" From these inklings of passive and motor automatism he\ndrew, with anything but confidence, the following conclusions : Maria\nGuimaraes had been in some shipwrecked or burning vessel ; she had\nbeen taken off in a boat that was painted green, she fainted on the\noccasion. The whole affair seemed to be so very improbable that C.\nhesitated to speak to Senr. Guimaraes about it. On Saturday, May\n30th, he told his experience to Senr. Pinto, the clairvoyant above\nmentioned. The latter at once began experimenting by gazing at the\ndark cover of a book which C. had laid down. The description given\nsuggested to him the same scenes ; but from what he saw he supposed\nthat the wreck had taken place in the early morning. Thus encouraged,\nC. returned to Senr. Guimaraes, whom he found engaged with a\ncustomer. Approaching the subject in a guarded manner, he reminded\nhim of their late topic of conversation, and asked whether the person\nspoken of had at any time been in great danger on the sea. Guimaraes'\naffirmative reply, given with an air of much seriousness, threw C. into\na state of excited astonishment. In answer to more direct questions\nthe barber stated that Dona Maria and her mother had been in a\nshipwreck, that it was in the early morning, and that they had been\nsaved in a boat. He could not, however, say what the colour of the\nboat was, and he did not know whether the ship sank or not. C.\nhurried back to Senr. Pinto and told him of the result of his question\ning. At request this gentleman made a written statement, the\nprincipal value of which is the proof it affords that C.'s intuitions were\nrecounted to a second person before steps were taken to verify their\nexactness. The translation of this statement here follows :\n\" Shortly after 3 o'clock in the afternoon of the 30th of the current\nmonth of May, C. related his visions to me, saying that in a mental\npicture he saw a ship being wrecked1 and persons who were being\nsaved in a boat. Concentrating [my attention] I gazed fixedly at the\ndark border of a book and saw the same images that he had described,\nwith the addition that the situation in which the ship was seen\nwas really that of a wreck ; moreover, the growing light on that side\nshowed that the shipwreck had taken place in the early morning.\nThe same C. affirmed that the shipwreck was part of the life experience\nof Maria Guimaraes, the wife of Senr. Guimaraes.2 Having left our\n1 This is not quite correct. C. had a mental picture of a ship tossed in a heavy\nsea and said so.\n2 When C. told his experience to Senr. Pinto, he of course could not, and did\nnot, affirm this positively. It was a mere conjecture.\n\fMAE., 1902.] Mind Reading and Allied Phenomena. 207\nplace C. returned ten minutes afterwards, saying that he had asked\nSenr. Guimaraes whether this had really happened or not. The latter\nhad replied affirmatively. The occurrence had taken place as above\nrelated. \" (Signed) ISMAEL AUGUSTO PINTO.\n\" 32 RUA DE OONCALVES DlAS,\n\" 3.40 P.M., May 30th, 1896.\"\nFurther questioning elicited the information that Senr. Guimaraes\nmarried his second wife in 1873, shortly after her arrival in Brazil from\nthe Azores. She died on June 22nd, 1885. Her maiden name was\nMaria de Mattos Mendonca, her mother being called Anna Guilhermina\nMendonca. It appeared that, excepting his knowledge of the danger\nincurred by the vessel (which he supposed to have amounted to actual\nshipwreck) and one or two striking personal incidents, Guimaraes had\nvery hazy and probably erroneous ideas respecting the occurrence. It\ntook place before his marriage, and his wife did not willingly refer to\nan event which had inspired her with so much terror. Some of the\ndetails given by him in apparent good faith were thrown into complete\ndiscredit by subsequent inquiries. He was almost certainly wrong in\nthe date he gave and wrong in the name of the vessel. He did not\nafterwards appear to be certain that the supposed wreck took place in\nthe early morning. He was sure, however, that Dona Anna Mendonqa\nand her daughter were taken off in a boat, and that Maria Mendo^a\nwas placed in it in a fainting condition, and recovered consciousness\nonly after she had been landed. Dona Anna herself had shown great\ncourage. He had never before spoken to C. on this subject, and, in\ngeneral, he was not accustomed to refer to his wife's adventure in his\nconversation. There was a book of dressmaking accounts for 1882 in\nSenr. Guimaraes' possession which was said to have contained a note\nof the occurrence. The leaf whereon the note had been written had,\nhowever, been torn out by the children. His daughter thought that\nthe vessel was the galera (full-rigged ship) Maria da Gloria, and with\nthis clue C. made diligent inquiries at the Portuguese Consulate and\namong shipping agents. The result of his investigations was the\ninformation that in 1873 the Maria da Gloria, a vessel trading between\nBrazil and the Azores, touched at the island of Sao Miguel and received\npassengers for Fayal. Off this port she met with a gale and was\ninjured by the swell, probably springing a leak, for they had to work\nthe pumps. The passengers were landed in a boat or boats. The\nvessel, which was not lost on this occasion, afterwards went into dock\nfor repairs. Now, Dona Anna and her daughter came from Sao\nMiguel, and the date of their voyage to Brazil coincides with that of\n\f208 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAR., 1902.\nthe gale suffered by the Maria da Gloria. The circumstances inde\npendently verified by C. were very similar to those remembered by\nSenr. Guimaraes and his daughter ; and as the latter believed the ship\nto have been the Maria da Gloria, it becomes highly probable that C.'s\nintuitions faithfully reflected a real occurrence. C. was also informed\nthat green paint, being cheap, is much used by Portuguese sailors, and\nthat their boats would probably have that colour. The ship, which\nwas afterwards sold at Lisbon, seems to have been subsequently lost in\na voyage to the States.\nOn January 25th, 1899, Senr. Guimaraes told C. that he had been\nmuch worried, and that in the night-time he had heard a voice like that\nof his second wife telling him to have patience, for he had to fulfil his\ndestiny. C. then described the manner in which Dona Maria used to\nbe attired. She wore a dress of Scotch check, the green colour pre\ndominating. There was a narrow collar turned down over the dress,\nbut not joining in front. A black brooch, probably of jet, forming two\nsymmetrical coils, was worn. These guesses were fully confirmed by\nthe barber. His wife was very fond of Scotch patterns for her dresses,\nand she used to wear a brooch of the form described, which was still in\nhis possession. Five days later, however, Guimaraes happened to say\nFid. 8.\nthat there was some ornament in the centre of the brooch, omitted in\nthe description. An idea of this in outline was obtained by C. as here\nshown. It was afterwards said to be a rosette which adapted itself to\nthe turns of the brooch. The percipient spoke of Dona Maria's hearty\nlaughter, and found that he was right in supposing that she had a\nmerry disposition. He assured the barber, with a conviction that he\nwas speaking the truth peculiar to such introspective moods, that his\nwife was quite happy, and that she followed him from afar in thought,\nalthough she no longer drew near to earth conditions. An attempt was\nmade to enter into more satisfactory communication with Maria Gui\nmaraes at a sitting conducted by Senr. Ismael Pinto ; but as soon as this\nardent Kardecist began his invocation to guardian angels, good spirits,\nand his patron saint, St. Michael, C. felt, as it were, the inrush of a dark\ncloud. It is enough to say that the seance was worse than a failure.\n[A few minor incidents relating to experiences probably not more\nthan subjective are here omitted.]\n(To be continued.)\n\fNo. CLXXXVIII.\u2014VOL.

Information on these points will\nbe given in a later number of the Journal.\nTHE NEW BOOMS OF THE SOCIETY.\nWE are glad to be able to inform our readers that the Society has\njust entered into possession of its new rooms at 20 Hanover Square,\nLondon, W. The situation is one which it is hoped will be found\nmore convenient and generally accessible for members than our old\npremises, and the rooms themselves are larger and more commodious.\nThe set consists of a large room, 20 feet by 17 feet, a smaller one,\n17 feet by 13 feet, and a store-room between the two, with space for\nthe storage of Proceedings, for which hitherto extra rent has had to be\npaid. The rooms are on the fourth floor of the house, but a lift up to\nthe second floor is being erected. They will be open for the present\nevery week-day from 1 1 a.m. to 5 p.m.\nThe house is occupied by a large number of scientific and other\nsocieties, including the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society, Clinical\nSociety, Japan Society, Pathological Society, Quekett Microscopical\nClub, Royal Archaeological Institute, etc., and our rooms are the\nproperty of the Koyal Medical and Chirurgical Society.\nThey are hired at a rent of \u00a3140 per annum, but this rental includes\nthe use of a large hall on the ground floor for our General Meetings\nthree times in the year and of a smaller hall, also on the ground floor,\nseven or eight times in the year, in which the proposed private\nmeetings, for members and associates only, can be held.\nEven with the deductions thus involved, the necessary additional\nexpenditure will be a serious tax on the income of the Society. Our\nreaders will remember that in the Journal for last June was printed\nan Address by the Council to the Society, urging the necessity\nfor an increased income if the work already achieved was to be\ncontinued and carried forward in a manner worthy of our past history.\nIt was suggested that funds were needed especially for two objects\n(1) the appointment of a competent organising secretary, who would\ndevote all his time to the work; (2) to enable us to take larger and\nmore convenient rooms, which would be more accessible to members\nfor consultation or intercourse, and in which small meetings for informal\ndiscussion and experiments might be held.\n\f212 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [APRIL, 1902..\nLast October the first of these objects was attained, as we were then\nfortunate enough to secure the services of Mr. N. W. Thomas as\norganising secretary ; and now, after a considerable amount of labour\non the part of the Committee appointed to negotiate for the hiring of\nrooms, our new offices have been taken.\nThe present seems therefore a suitable moment to remind our\nreaders that the response to the Council's appeal, though considerable,\nhas not yet been sufficient to meet the necessary additional expenses.\nThe donations received or promised up to the present amount to\n\u00a3151. 10s. and the annual subscriptions to \u00a3114. 2s.

PIPER.\nTo the Editor of the\nJOURNAL OP THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nFebruary 13th, 1902.\nI think I ought to correct some misunderstanding in Mrs. Barker's admir\nable letter published in the January Journal, which was a little delayed\nin reaching me. In doing so, however, I wish to express my appreciation\nof the critical spirit which she has shown in regard to my report, especially\nas it is so hard to induce our scientific Philistines to see the possibilities\nwith which we have to contend in the attempt to defend a spiritistic\nhypothesis, and most especially when it is conceived as aiming at demonstra\ntion regarding the survival and identity of a particular individual. Mrs.\nBarker has apparently thought the problem out to its full extent, and\ncertainly sees some of the difficulties in the way of entertaining a demon\nstrated spiritism, while the average scientific man simply sneers at all\ntheories alike, even of any supernormal character. It is impossible to get\nhim even to look at the matter. Mrs. Barker's attitude, therefore, is quite\na welcome one, and in reply I wish only to correct what I understand is an\nentire misapprehension of my position. This may be natural enough, con\nsidering the massive character of my report, but it is a misapprehension\nnevertheless, and I cannot do a better thing at present, perhaps, than to\ncorrect it for all readers accessible by the Journal while the subject is a\nmatter of consideration in reading the report.\nIt is apparent that Mrs. Barker has read and criticised my report with\n\fAPRIL, 1902.] Correspondence. 213\nthe assumption that it claims to be a demonstration of spiritism. Speaking of\nthe allegations of Mystic Brotherhoods and Occult Societies, as hypotheses\nthat might stand in the way of demonstrated spiritism, she says: \"Are we\nat liberty to claim as proved conclusions which depend for their truth upon\nthe falsity of what those people assert, before we have proved its falsity ?\"\nLet me indicate by numbers the various points to be made in reply to the\nseveral positions at least hypothetically assumed by Mrs. Barker.\n(1) I do not make any claim for the demonstration of spiritism. On the\ncontrary, I distinctly disavowed any such pretensions. See pp. 4 (footnote),\n86, 90, 244-247, 290-291, and especially pp. 295, 296, where I think I anti\ncipate and answer, by implication at least, every point raised by Mrs.\nBarker's animadversions. Many other statements, too brief to mention\nhere, were also made in disclaimer of Mrs. Barker's point of view.\n(2) If Mrs. Barker will read carefully what I said on pp. 244-247 about\n'. proof,\" she will appreciate more clearly the position that I hold in regard\nto other possible theories, and the measure of assurance to be held regard\ning spiritism. I try to show there and elsewhere that the question is\nmerely as to a preference between alternative possibilities, with the\ncredentials in favour of spiritism so far as the evidence at hand goes.\nWhat the future might offer is not considered until it puts in its evidence.\n(3) Mrs. Barker entirely misunderstands the function of science in the\ncase, when proposing the claims of Mysticism and Occultism against the\nspiritistic theory. Science is a body of truths or hypotheses which have\npresented empirical credentials in their favour, and are to be modified by the\nsame methods. Until Mysticism and Occultism can condescend to give\nexperimental evidence of their claims, they are so much a priori rubbish to\nbe disregarded. I do not deny their a priori possibility, but the problem, as\nI have presented it in my report, in the absence of all scientific support for\nopposing claims, is, \" On which side does the present evidence stand ? \"\nSpiritism is a working hypothesis, and until critics can produce some experi\nmental data on an adequate scale favouring their transcendental theories\nand involving non-spiritistic phenomena, our only problem is to see whether\nspiritism can be made to explain the facts consistently, and it is strong or\nweak in proportion to that ability.\n(4) I deny that we have to prove the falsity of Mysticism and Occultism\nas a pre-condition of maintaining spiritism, except as the evidence for\nspiritism tends to disprove the former. Logic shows that we cannot prove a\nnegative. We may disprove spiritism by proving Mysticism, etc., or we\nmay disprove these latter by proving spiritism. But we are neither able\nnor obliged to prove the falsity of Mysticism and Occultism as a condition\nof holding to spiritism. It is the business of occultists to present scientific\nevidence of their claims, real or hypothetical, as a condition of their con\nsideration in a scientific court. I repeat that they are quite as possible a\npriori as my own theory, but, as even Mrs. Barker admits, \" we are under\nno obligation to accept without proof what these people tell us of ' tele\npathic ' powers,\" etc. If it came to a priori considerations, I think that I\n\f214 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [APRIL, 1902.\ncould offer several more than Mrs. Barker suggests. But I am not troubled\nabout that sort of \" science.\"\n(5) The true point de repere of science, both in the treatment of explana\ntion and in the estimation of evidence, is the theory of Materialism, and\nnot any supernormal possibilities whatsoever. Materialism claims to ex\nplain all phenomena, and in so doing endeavours to reduce the phenomena of\nconsciousness to functions of the brain, relying upon mechanical analogies\nto accomplish its object. Our business is to show that there are some\nphenomena which its assumptions will not explain, and which spiritism\ndoes explain. We do not even require to consider \"telepathy,\" unless it\nhas empirical support, and tends to make spiritism superfluous as a theory.\nFor aught that I know, \" telepathy \" is perfectly consistent with Mate\nrialism, and hence its right to contend with spiritism, if it has any empirical\nevidence in favour of its being a fact in some sense of the term. But until\nany other supernormal possibilities can present equal credentials empiri\ncally, they must be thrown out of court in a scientific procedure, and I do\nnot pretend to estimate the problem from any other point of view.\n(6) This \" telepathy \" which critics fling at our spiritistic heads so\nvigorously, is at best a vague conception that can be used against us only\nbecause it is vague. The only meaning of the term which science can\nadmit at present is that of a coincidence which requires a causal explanation,\nbut it is not an explanation of anything. So far as that is concerned, it\nis an unknown principle. It implies a supernormal of some sort, and gets\nits cogency against spiritism partly from the fact that its limits are not\nclearly defined when assuming it as explanatory, partly also from the fact\nthat it diverts the evidential problem from the question of the super\nnormal to that of transcendental personal identity, and partly from the\nfact that most people confuse the supernormal as a phenomenon with its\nexplanation. But the only \" telepathy,\" whether as a phenomenon or as an\nexplanation, which makes any pretension to adequate scientific support\n(and even that is denied by most scientific men), is that which limits it to\nthe present active states of consciousness (pp. 135-138). This ad libitum \"tele\npathy \" from the memory, whether of sitters or of people on the other side\nof the globe,\u2014to say nothing of its selective production of personal identity\nand limitation to trivialities when its powers, as assumed, should enable it\nto obtain the important as well,\u2014has no adequate scientific credentials as\nyet, and hence it is an act of supererogatory condescension and mercy\non our part that we should even consider it for the sake of argument. As\nI said in the last sentence of my report (p. 296), when it is experimentally\nproved in non-spiritistic phenomena representing the personal identity of\nthe living in the organising form of the Piper phenomena, it will be time\nto reconsider the position that I have taken. I assume its largest exten\nsion merely to indicate what must be done by it in order to maintain its\nopposition to spiritism ; but this assumption for the sake of pushing an\nadversary must not be taken to imply that I admit its scientific right to be\nconsidered as either true or capable of explaining the facts. It is a con\n\fAPRIL, 1902.] Correspondence. 215\nvenient conception in this large form to bring out the nice psychological\nshades of incidents which would be true on a spiritistic theory, and which\na telepathic theory must imitate in order to compete with the spiritistic, but\nif \" telepathy \" is simply a function to duplicate the spiritistic, and produce\nnothing else supernormal, it loses its antagonism to the spiritistic. Hence\nits larger meaning must be scientifically proved before I need fear it.\n(7) Science insists on consistency with the established body of knowledge\nor belief as the safest criterion for the validity of any new propositions,\nat least in some of their accidents, until the evidence is sufficient to justify\nan entire departure from existing assumptions. I made a special claim\nfor spiritism in my Report (p. 294) against \" telepathy,\" and as satisfying\nthis demand in its fundamental characteristic. Spiritism, as I there stated,\nsimply extends a known principle,\u2014the personality of a definitely known\nbeing beyond certain physical conditions,\u2014to explain the occurrence of\ncertain mental phenomena, just as Newton simply extended the known or\nsupposed terrestrial gravitation beyond the earth to explain the celestial\nsystem. This mere extension of personal identity enables us to test the\ncase by the principles and assumption of normal psychology, while the use\nof \" telepathy \" so implicates the problem with the supernormal as to\ndisturb that community with existing conceptions which must always be\nthe safest criterion of truth. \" Telepathy,\" as just indicated, is admittedly\nnothing more than the statement of a phenomenon to be explained and is\nnot its explanation. It is an evidential standard, and is not an explanatory\nprinciple. Hence spiritism has the first claim to our allegiance as a\nscientific theory or hypothesis, even if \"telepathy\" should turn out pre\nferable after experimentation.\n(8) Mrs. Barker's remarks on the \" possibility of suspending judgment\nconcerning the nature of the intermediaries while considering the nature of\nthe personalities represented by them \" is misleading. It at least seems to\nimply that I had not admitted this \" possibility,\" when as a matter of fact I\ndistinctly stated that this might be a view taken in the case (pp. 264 and\n292). But I undertook to show why this was not the proper scientific\nposition, in as much as spiritism depended primarily on proving personal\nidentity of the deceased (pp. 4-5, and 263), and as the trance personalities do\nnot supply us with the data for this end, we are obliged from the standpoint\nof science to assume them to be the secondary personalities of Mrs. Piper.\nIf I were not obliged to reckon with secondary personality at all, the\nproblem would be very different. I might then put all personalities on the\nsame level. But with personal identity as the problem, and to determine\nthe method of procedure, we can scientifically transcend the normal only by\nusing the data that might not be explicable by secondary personality.\n(9) Again, Mrs. Barker's use of the conception of secondary personality\nentirely misconceives its scientific import. The Occultists, whose supposi\ntion she here states hypothetically, assume in what they ascribe to it that it\nis a supernormal function. This is not its conception in psychopathology.\nIn both physiology and psychology, whether normal or abnormal, it is purely\n\f216 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [APRIL, 1902.\na normal as distinct from a supernormal function. Whatever its powers of\nacquisition, they are referable to supraliminal agencies for the data, and\nare not supposed to possess any supernormal characteristics. That is to say,\nthe supernormal is not a necessary adjunct or characteristic of secondary\npersonality, and so cannot be assumed to represent any such functions as the\nOccultist ascribes to it without empirical proof. Now as long as secondary\npersonality is subordinated to the agencies of the primary personality, or\nsupraliminal, in the acquisition of its data and its powers, it cannot possibly\nbe supernormal, unless we should equally discover the supernormal in the\nsupraliminal. Consequently the question can never be whether the dis\ntinction between the normal and supernormal coincides with that between\nthe supraliminal and subliminal, or primary and secondary personality,\nbut whether the supernormal is a necessary characteristic of either of them.\nIf it is a necessary feature of them, we simply change our conception of the\nterms. If it is not, we simply refuse to admit that the secondary or primary\npersonality of any one can exercise supernormal functions, and insist that\nthe supernormal is a distinct function. Hence in default of securing any\npresumptions in favour of the supernormal by reference to secondary per\nsonality, the Occultist must present empirical proof of his thesis that\nsubliminals are running about the world gathering up information,\n\" unbeknownst \" to the people from whom it is obtained, and palming it\noff as spirits. I shall listen patiently to any evidence on this point.\n(10) Mrs. Barker also misunderstands and confuses the subject of fraud\nin this problem. She confuses together the questions of conscious and uncon\nscious or subliminal fraud, and apparently does not apprehend why the sub\nject of \"fraud,\" as my Report discusses it, is considered at all. The\n\" honesty of the medium \" is never more than an answer to an objection. It\ncan never constitute the genuineness of the fact, but only serve as evidence\nfor it. Our business is to perform experiments in which fraud (conscious\nfraud) by Mrs. Piper alone is impossible, no matter what she might have\ndone in the past or in any other particular. Honesty is only a means of\nconvincing the public ; it is not a means of making the facts genuine. The\nscientific conditions must determine this quality, and honesty is only one of\nthe considerations that enter into the question, and this not the fundamental\none.\nAs to unconscious (subliminal) fraud, we have two wholly separate\nquestions. (1) Whether it is merely the secondary personality of Mrs.\nPiper with characteristics that are the same or different from her normal\n(supraliminal) consciousness. (2) Whether this supposed fraudulent sub\nliminal is also coupled with supernormal powers. In regard to the first of\nthese, its action is excluded from the case by the same scientific conditions\nwhich determined the evidence of the supernormal. In regard to the\nsecond, the only possible method of determining whether it can account for\nthe facts is to examine the extent of its powers or limitations, and having\ndone this with the consideration of the necessary implications involved,\nsimply ask ourselves whether we can admit all the supernormal adjuncts\n\fAPRIL, 1902.] Correspondence. 217\ninvolved without specific empirical evidence. I indicated this in various\npassages of my Report, among them see pp. 142-146, 153, and 292, and the\nimplications of \" Mistakes and Confusion,\" pp. 214-238. I might remark\ntoo that if the subliminal, or secondary personality, be half so shrewd as\nMrs. Barker supposes in her hypothesis, there would be no possibility of\ndetecting it after assuming a large-range \"telepathy,\" or the mobile\ncapacities of the subliminal in space and selective ingenuity. The Occultist\nmust prove empirically that this is a fact. I simply repeat that I do not\nhave to prove a negative. The Occultist must prove the affirmative.\nAgain, in connecting what I said about fraud on p. 158 with what I said\non p. 178, Mrs. Barker absolutely confuses the whole question of fraud.\nIn the first of these references I was discussing the alternatives between\nsupraliminal fraud and spiritism as theories. Whether there was subliminal\nfraud with supernormal powers was not the issue. I was here dealing with\nthe average scientific Philistine. In the second reference I was discussing\nthe question whether, in spite of my assumption, the trance personalities\nmight not be discarnate spirits according to their claims, and admitting\nthe difficulty of \"transcending the telepathic hypothesis\" if we assumed\nthat these trance personalities were the subliminal of Mrs. Piper. I was\nnot dealing with either subliminal fraud or fraudulent discaruate spirits,\n\u2022as Mrs. Barker's animadversions seem to imply that I should have done.\nI simply stated a problem, and suggested that there was something to\nfavour, though not to prove, that Imperator and Rector were what they\nclaimed to be, namely, discarnate spirits. If I do not transcend the tele\npathic hypothesis, it is because the Occultist has proved his theory. But\nwhere is the evidence ? Where has the Occultist given scientific evidence\nof his assumed subliminal powers and organising intelligence in this acute\nimitation of spirits? If I have transcended the telepathic hypothesis, we\nhave spiritism as the conclusion, though I may not have eliminated the pos\nsibility of subliminal fraud on Mrs. Piper's part, nor fraud on the part of\n\u2022discarnate spirits. But the existence of evil spirits was not my problem.\nIt was a question of any spirits at all, and you may think what you\nplease about Imperator and Rector after supposing that they are discarnate\n.spirits.\n(11) Mrs. Barker confuses the questions of \"mediums,\" \"intermediaries,\"\nand \"controls.\" I do not state anywhere in my Report, in the technical\nsense of that term, that \"the communicators through Mrs. Piper's hand act\nsimply as mediums.\" I speak of them now and then as \"intermediaries,\"\nbut not as \" mediums.\" Mrs. Piper is the only \" medium \" that I recognise\nin the case, in any technical sense of the term. The \" controls\" may act as\n\" intermediaries,\" and other \" communicators \" may do the same when\n\" communicating \" data bearing upon the identity of others than themselves.\nBut none of them are treated, or supposed to be, \"mediums.\" It is apparent,\nhowever, that Mrs. Barker refers to the \" controls,\" or trance personalities,\nand she says : \" It would seem that to determine the nature of the inter\nmediaries was a pre-condition of the discussion of their honesty.\" This may\n\f218 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [APRIL, 1902.\nbe true if their honesty has anything to do with the problem, which it has\nnot, if we suppose that the \" intermediaries \" are discarnate spirits. If\nthey are \" incarnate minds acting ' telepathically ' through Mrs. Piper's\norganism,\" I would merely apply M rs. Barker's maxim that \" we are under\nno obligation to accept without proof\" what these claims suppose. I would\nalso suggest that here, as well as in the discussion of spiritism, it might be\nwell to first determine the nature of such supposed intermediaries before\ndiscussing their honesty ! Besides, the question of the honesty of the\n\" intermediaries \" is not connected in any way with that of Mrs. Piper,\nwhich is a supraliminal matter, so far as my report is concerned. If I were\ncalled upon to estimate the problem' after evidence had been put in for the\nassumed influence of \"incarnate minds,\" it would be, perhaps, a different\nmatter ; but it will be time to consider it when Mrs. Barker or the Occultist\nputs in that evidence. The \" assertion by many disinterested persons that\nthis form of telepathy does exist,\" does not make it \"necessary\" that we\n\" suspend judgment upon the identity of the communicators other than the\ncontrols,\" as conjectured by Mrs. Barker. The \"proof\" of it might, but\nmere \" assertion,\" even according to Mrs. Barker as above quoted, does not\nmerit any scientific attention. Moreover, if we are \" to determine the\nnature of the intermediaries as a pre-condition of their honesty,\" why should\nwe attach so much importance to investigating the \" reliability \" and \" truth\nfulness \" of Imperator ?\n(12) Again, Mrs. Barker entirely misconceives the issue of my Report\nwhen she supposes that I must consider the hypothesis that Imperator and\nhis group are discarnate spirits and then question the \"proof\" of the\npersonal identity of the other \" communicators.\" That is to take spiritism\nfor granted when it is the issue. Whether spiritism is true is one issue, the\none I was trying to defend. Whether, if the Imperator group were discar\nnate spirits, I had sufficiently \"proved\" the independent existence of the\nother \"communicators\" is another issue, and one that I was not considering\nand also was forbidden to consider according to the standard assumed\n(pp. 4, 5, and 263). I have nothing to do with the question finally whether\nthe Imperator group are discarnate spirits, until they condescend to prove\ntheir personal identity. I may suggest, as I did in discussing the dramatic\nplay (pp. 176-184), that there is something to support their spiritistic claims',\nbut unless they do something to satisfy the criterion of personal identity,\nmy obligation is to treat them as secondary personalities of Mrs. Piper\n(pp. 265, 266), even if I incline to believe that they are spirits. Mrs.\nBarker's problem here is not spiritism, but, assuming spiritism as proved,\nwhether I had \" proved \" the spiritistic nature of a certain personality other\nthan the Imperator group. The question of science is whether we are forced\nto treat the Imperator group as rnolie, than Mrs. Piper's subliminal, and if\nso, then spiritism being once supposed, there ought not to be much difficulty\nin measuring the evidence for the existence of other spirits, as is virtually\nadmitted in one statement of Mrs. Barker. The last sentence on page 264\nof my Report shows how this may be done, and the general method is more\n\fAPRIL, 1902.] Correspondence. 219\nfully discussed between pages 262 and 267. I cannot enter into this question\nat length here, but I can repeat and emphasise the importance of our\nobligation to assume that the Imperator group are the secondary person\nalities of Mrs. Piper, until they have either given us satisfactory credentials\nof their identity, or sufficient evidence of their independent existence as\nspirits. After that we shall simply ascertain whether their limitations are\nconsistent with the supposition that they, as spirits, are palming off\ntranscendentally acquired knowledge as the personalities of other spirits.\nIf the Imperator group are spirits, the confusion of other \"communicators\"\nwould be incompatible with their own clearness when they communicate for\nthemselves, and still more pertinently, their limitation to trivial matters\nwould be absurd. We could understand how Mrs. Pipers subliminal might\nbe clear in expressing itself, but confused when acting telepathically, but\nit would be absurd for the Imperator group to be clear when communicating\nfor themselves and confused when \" communicating \" for other alleged spirits\nand claiming that they are present.\n(13) A propos of the theory that the Imperator group are discarnate spirits\ncollecting facts to palm them off as evidence of other spirits, and that the\nJohn M'Clellan incident appears as if it supported this view, Mrs. Barker's\ndiscussion of this incident shows some confusion, and fails to recognise the\npossible intermediation of my uncle as an interpretation of the case. (1) The\nrecord does not assert or imply that the family names connected with this\nJohn M'Clellan and confused with incidents about my uncle's father by the\nsame name were given by this uncle James M'Clellan. That is implied by\nMrs. Barker's interpretation, while I definitely indicated (p. 112) that they\nwere given by my father and cousin. It was the reference to war and the\nlost finger that my uncle apparently gave. (2) The record which it is\nsupposed that Rector or some confrere had examined does not contain any\nreference to either the family names or the lost finger. All that is there\nrecorded, as my Report indicates, is the fact that this John M'Clellan was\ncommissioned as an ensign. All the other facts, names of connections and\nthe incident of the lost finger, would have had to be obtained by rummaging\nabout the memories of different persons, since it required correspondence\nover two states and travel over different counties of the same state to\nascertain the truth of the messages. Any discarnate spirit that could per\nform a synthetic miracle of this kind ought not to misplace the incidents in\nthe experience of my uncle's father. (3) It should also be remembered that\nit is quite possible that my uncle James M'Clellan knew the facts about this\nold John M'Clellan, since he lived within seven or eight miles of him and\nmarried a sister of my mother, who was born and lived near this John\nM'Clellan. For aught also that I know, he might have been a remote\nrelative of my uncle, though I have so far been unable to ascertain this\nfrom descendants of either family. Those among my own relatives say he\nwas not, but they also did not know of his existence. (4) Accepting the\nspiritistic theory, as Mrs. Barker's assumption does, unless we suppose that\nthe ordinary \"communicator\" is clear, which the psychological character\n\f220 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [APRIL, 1902.\nof the phenomena does not sustain, there is no more reason, as Mrs. Barker\nsupposes, that Rector would more naturally commit the mistake here pi-e-\nsumed to have been made as the result of inquiry, than to suppose that my\nuncle committed it in the confusion of communicating. My uncle apparently\nacts as a \"communicator\" on his own account and an intermediary for this\nold John M'Olellan in order to clear up some admitted confusion. Notice\n(p. 471) that he first mentioned a John and Frank, which probably referred\nto the John M'Clellan who was not his father and Frank Williams men\ntioned earlier (p. 438). He then apparently indicates that it was his brother\nJohn who went to the war, but as he corrected this immediately by reflection\nand intimation of confusion, we can well suppose that the statement, \" he\nwas the one who went to war,\" was an explanatory interlocution to Eector\nwho was trying so hard to get the matter \" straight \" and hence as referring\nto the first John mentioned. In his confusion about the two John\nM'Clellans, one his father and the other a supposed stranger, we may well\nsuppose that my uncle might have said things which belonged to the\nstranger John M'Clellan and which Rector mistook as referring to my\nuncle's father. Compare Rector's mistake : \" I got it all but the Hyslop \"\n(p. 465). The confusion would be natural in the attempt to communicate\non his own account and at the same time to act as an intermediary for\nanother party, especially if the conditions in any way disturbed his normal\nconsciousness, as the evidence indicates for all \"communicators\" except the\ntrance personalities. That other intermediaries than the Imperator group\n\" communicate \" for others than themselves is apparent in the cases of my\nbrother Charles and my sister Annie (pp. 100-108), and also more or less\nmy father and my cousin. The previous Piper Reports, as well as my own,\nare full of instances of a like phenomenon, so that the Imperator group are\nnot the only personalities who must be supposed to be spirits hunting up\ninformation in this occult fashion to palm it off as spirits. Besides there\nhave been controls which have supplied evidence of their identity before\nacting as intermediaries. George Pelham is a case in point. But the most\nimportant circumstance at present is that confusion and error are just as\nlikely, if we suppose the \" communicator \" to be in a more or less secondary\nstate (and the evidence will hardly permit any other supposition, except in\nthe cases of Imperator and Rector with their group), as they are if we\nsuppose that Rector or a confrere makes mistake in the collation of his data.\nThe latter assumption also is handicapped by the circumstance that the\nImperator group are clear in their communications, so that no matter how\nfragmentary the information they obtain by their rummaging about human\nrecords and memories, they should avoid confusion in telling it.\n(14) Mrs. Barker's assumption that we must adopt a theory which\nsupposes the unity of the physical phenomena in the case of Stainton\nMoses and of the psychological phenomena in the Piper case I do not\nadmit. Mrs. Barker entirely misunderstands the nature of our problem\nin both these cases. If the Piper case exhibited such physical phenomena\non the one hand, and if the Moses case exhibited the same kind of a record\n\fAPRIL, 1902.] Correspondence. 221\non the other, the question might be a different one. But the first question\nwith us as investigators is the conditions under which the phenomena occur,\nour knowledge of them, and the completeness and continuity of the record,\nmade by others than the medium. Hence I refuse to admit the importance\nof the Stainton Moses case, except as a stimulus to investigation. I do not\ndeny that there were supernormal phenomena there. I could go so far as.\nto admit that they most certainly were there. But the circumstances were\nsuch in making the record that we do not have any sure criterion for the\ndistinction between supernormal agencies and the subliminal phenomena of\nStainton Moses himself. This is particularly true of his physical phenomena.\nIt is much more difficult to prove the supernormal nature of physical than\nof psychological phenomena. Hence, considering the imperfection of the\nrecord, the Stainton Moses case is evidently valueless for speculative purposes\non the points raised by Mrs. Barker. The supraliminal probity of Stainton\nMoses does not affect the question. That is only a consideration which\nremoves the ordinary explanation. The real problem is to determine first\nhow much was done by him unconsciously, and for which his normal con\nsciousness could not be held responsible. For aught that we know, the\nphysical phenomena of that case were produced by Stainton Moses himself\nin an abnormal state of mind, at least some of the most striking of them,\nand then discovered by his normal consciousness, which had no memory of\nthe subliminal action. The Flournoy case lends much support to this\npossibility. Mile. Helene Smith undoubtedly performed certain physical\ntricks in her trance condition of which she had no recollection afterward,\nand which she would have supposed to be supernormal if it had not been\nthat Prof. Flournoy had indisputable evidence to the contrary. Compare\nmy article in the North American Review, vol. clxxi. We need, therefore, a\nfar better record than that of Stainton Moses himself, better also than that\nof Dr. Speer, to assure evidential value for the narrative of physical\nphenomena in that case. I am not denying the actual genuineness of some\nor even all of these physical phenomena. For aught that I know, they may\nbe what they are represented to be. But in the absence of an adequate\nrecord and of a satisfactory criterion for the distinction between what was\nsubliminal and what supernormal, I must remain in the position of an\nagnostic and demand more proof. I cannot assume to explain a phenomenon\nuntil I am assured that it is a fact. When, therefore, we are able to\ndetermine what is Imperator's \"record,\" and what the subliminal of\nStaintou Moses, we may enter into speculation regarding explanations.\nMoreover, it would not help matters in the least to establish the genuine\nness of these physical phenomena, since mere physical phenomena have no\ntendency to prove spiritism. The standard for that theory is a very\ndifferent one. Physical phenomena might be explained by spirits, but\nthey are not evidence of them. Consequently the \" truthfulness \" of Im-\nperator cannot be a subject of serious consideration evidentially, because, as\nI have remarked above, he is not obliged \" to stand by his own record,\"\nunless we can show what is his \" record,\" and what the subliminal of Stainton\n\f222 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [APRIL, 1902.\nMoses. Moreover, Mrs. Barker must recognise from her own assumptions\nthat almost any amount of \"truthfulness\" is compatible with devilishness,\nso that we might not gain anything by establishing that quality of Imperator\nin the Moses phenomena, unless we could fix it in each particular case, and\nwe should not be able to \" prove \" his statements through Mrs. Piper very\neasily, if at all. That would have to be an article of faith outside of our\nscientific procedure. No, it is the personal identity problem that is the\nmain question, and no matter whether the Imperator group are discarnate\nspirits or only the secondary personality of Mrs. Piper, after we have\nadmitted the supernormal, their limitations must be the test of the inde\npendent personalities of other \" communicators.\"\n(15) Mrs. Barker's analogy between the Imperator group's supposed\nacquisition of knowledge by visiting \"other human organisms,\" etc., and\ntheir use of Mrs. Piper's organism will not hold good. There is absolutely\nno evidence within my knowledge that they use Mrs. Piper's organism for\nthe collection of information, and if they did we ought to obtain what they\nso collect, after the analogy of what Mrs. Barker supposes might have been\nobtained from the History of Greene County, Ohio, and the memories of\npersons living there and elsewhere. They use Mrs. Piper's organism for\n\" communication,\" not acquisition, no matter how we may suppose that they\nget information from \" other organisms.\" But supposing them as getting it,\nthey ought not to be confused in \" communicating\" it, according to the usual\nindications of the record.\n(16) Mrs. Barker must not be shocked at the divine honours paid to\nImperator in \"the bowing of the hand and capitalising of the personal\npronoun,\" as that is merely a part of the record of what goes on, the like of\nwhich should have been noted in the case of Stainton Moses, if it occurred.\nWe do not attach any importance to this phenomenon, but may readily\nenough ascribe it all to Mrs. Piper's secondary personality, and not even\nthen admit any such conception of the subliminal as the Occultists would\nhave us believe. I know we are a very democratic country (except when\nthe elections happen to go Republican, as Mr. Dooley might say), but, if I\nmistake not, Americans are quite interested in royal functionaries, whether\nthe matter concerns the entertainment of a Prince (excuse the capitalisation)\nor the coronation of a King. There seems to be a little aristocracy left even\nin this part of the globe among democratic mortals, and I am not sure that\nit is any worse than the same disposition on \" the other side.\"\nTo summarise the case in a conclusion, I must again remind Mrs. Barker\nthat my problem, in connection with what I understand scientific method to\nbe, is an inductive one, and not the demonstration deductively, or in any\nother way, of a future life. \/ was testing hypotheses which profess to have\nsome empirical evidence in their favour. I simply prefer the more rational of\nthese until those who hold a different theory present adequate scientific data\nin their support showing a preference in their favour.\nJAMES H. HYSLOP.\n\fAPRIL, 1902.] Correspondence. 223\nTELEPATHIC EXPERIMENTATION.\nTo the Editor of the\nJOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nI AM glad to see that the Society is making fresh efforts at telepathic\nexperimentation, and as a good many people seem to be \"unable to see\nwhat is the good of repeating what has already been done,\" J propose to\nmake some remarks on the scientific necessity of constant experimentation\nand progress, in the hope that the Society generally may thereby be stimu\nlated to co-operate seriously and systematically with these efforts.\nFurther experimentation is needed, not only to make further progress, but\nalso to secure the ground already won.\nTo take the second point first. It is, I believe, an (not wholly unreasonable)\narticle of faith with many of the experts of the Society that telepathy is a\nscientifically-established fact. Aye, but how long will it remain so ? If, as the\nyears roll on, we cannot point to fresh experiments, repeating, confirming,\nand extending those of bygone years, will not their impression grow ever\nfainter, and their character and conclusiveness be ever more obscured by the\ngloom of deepening suspicion ?\nIt would seem to be simply a matter of time for an ingenious sceptic\nto assume the role of advocatus diaboli, to make insinuations against our\nexperiments such as have often been made in the bosom of the Society\nitself against those of former days. Now, what I wish to point out\nis, that this is a contingency which all historical evidence has to face,\nirrespective of its character. The mere lapse of time progressively weakens\nit, and exposes it to scientific suspicion, because its initial cogency always,\nmore or less, depends on the scientific trustworthiness of the witnesses.\nHence doubts, which at the time were dissipated by personal knowledge\nof the witnesses, revive as this knowledge grows rarer. And even where\nspecific grounds of distrust are lacking, the general improbability of a per\nsistently unconfirmed allegation must crush the doctrine, or reduce it to a\npious hope. Indeed, I rather wonder whether some of those who were once\nconvinced by the Society's evidence may not have already, by this time,\ngrown the gravest scruples about its cogency. For, with a sceptical trend\nof mind, nothing would be easier, and even I, who have no special psycho\nlogical tendency to scepticism, often have qualms.\nBut in my case these arise also from other sources. All scientific experi\nence shows that there are no isolated facts. If, therefore, Telepathy is a fact,\nthere must somewhere be a great continent of facts, whence it springs and of\nwhich it announces the existence. But what has the Society so far done\nto discover this new region ? And until it has been discovered, the feeling of\nthe antecedent incredibility of telepathy is only temporarily repressed : it\nis not eradicated from the mind, and must ever send up fresh shoots. In\nthe present state of things, in short, Telepathy can only very hypotheti\n\f224 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [APRIL, 1902.\ncally be treated as fact, because it stands alone. To secure it, therefore, we\nmust progress beyond it.\nAgain, all scientific analogy requires us to progress. It is not enough\nin Science to establish a 'fact,' and then to leave it unsupported for time,\nand criticism to rot it away. A newly-discovered fact in science is promptly\nfollowed up and out into its consequences and applications, and these in\nreturn put its existence beyond doubt. And so proof is continuous and\ncumulative without end. But what have we done ? Who can say that\ntelepathic communication between minds ia easier or more trustworthy than\nit was twenty years ago ? And what should we think of the scientific status\nof the discoverers of wireless telegraphy, if they had contented themselves\nwith \"establishing the fact,\" and then had broken up their instruments,\nstopped their researches, and declined to put us practically into communica\ntion by these novel means ? A real scientific fact is always rendered useful,\nand there is much to be said for the view that what cannot be utilized cannot\nultimately be recognized as fact at all. It is clearly our duty, therefore,\nto improve telepathic communication until it can be practically used\u2014at all\nevents as between exceptional people, e.g. lovers, whom some of the earlier\nexperiments seemed to indicate as especially sensitive and appreciative of the\nprivilege.\nAs for the Society, I hope these considerations suffice to show that it\ncannot rest on its oars or its laurels, or any such uncomfortable substitutes\nfor well-stuffed chairs, at least until the academic repose of, let us say, the\nfuture \" Sidgwick and Myers Professor of Comparative Telepathy in the\nUniversity of Cambridge\" gratefully attests that the subject has in very\ndeed become a scientific fact in good standing.\nF.

W. THOMAS.\nIN the course of 1901 considerable interest was aroused in Berlin\nSpiritualistic circles by the performance of a new medium for \" Stoff-\nilurchdringung.\" A detailed account of the so-called box-experiment\nappeared in the Spiritistische Rundschau, Jahrg. 8, Nos. 9 and 10 (June\nand July, 1901). From this it appears that a wooden box, sealed\nand nailed up, was left with the medium, who, a few days later,\nannounced that it was no longer empty. The seals having been\nexamined at a meeting to which representatives of the press were\nadmitted, and having been found intact, the box was opened and\nshown to contain a medallion and various other objects. In the\nabsence of more precise information, it is impossible to say how far the\nprecautions taken were sufficient to prevent : (1) the opening and\nsubsequent closing of the box, and (2) the substitution of a box of\nexactly similar make and material.\nLater in the year another series of experiments was tried, to which\nthe attention of the S.P.R. was directed by Professor C. W. Sellin. The\nvisible result of them was several wine-glass and vase-shaped objects\nencircled by ivory rings, smaller in diameter than the extremities of the\nobjects themselves.\nIn an article in the Spiritistische Rundschau, Jahrg. 9, No. 2, these\nobjects were claimed as indisputable proofs of the passage of matter\n\f226 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAY, 1902.\nthrough matter : though it was frankly admitted that \" conditions \"\nwere non-existent, as the component parts were simply deposited in the\nbedroom of the medium and the finished object was ready for inspection\nin the morning. The alleged proof, therefore, depended wholly and\nsolely for its cogency on the supposed impossibility of producing the\nobject by natural means. The mere inspection of the photographs sent\nby Professor Sellin showed, however, that,\u2014apart from the possibility\nof manipulating the objects with the blow-pipe,\u2014the rings were so large\nthat they could easily be passed over the feet of the objects if by some\nmeans the ivory could be rendered slightly flexible. The flexibility can\nas a matter of fact be produced with ease.\nTwo other photographs sent a month later were more striking. The\nconstruction produced on November llth, 1901, consisted of three\nglasses passed through an ivory ring ; and about a week later three\nglasses were shown passed through two rings, one of which was ivory\nand the other wood.\nIt was, however, felt that the data to be gathered from an inspec\ntion of photographs were not sufficient for forming a judgment, and\nProfessor Sellin having stated that those in charge of the objects\nrefused to lend them, I was asked to go over to Berlin to inspect them.\nBy the kindness of Professor Sellin, to whom I am much indebted for\nhis unwearying efforts on my behalf, I was able on the night of my\narrival in Berlin (December 30th, 1901) to have an interview with the\nmedium, her fiance, and one of the officers of the Loge Psyche, under\nwhose auspices the experiments are performed.\nThe medium, who goes by the name of Emmeline Stillfried, is a girl\nof about 20 years of age. She is the daughter of a Silesian farmer, and\nhas had hallucinations of various sorts from her tenth year onwards.\nShe took service in 1900 in the family of a high government official in\nBerlin, and was there brought into contact with the Spiritualists ; she\nalso visited a spiritualistic circle, where she met her future fiance, C.\nR , an overseer in a factory where skilled workmen are employed.\nFrom a diary kept by him it appears that the supernormal powers of\nthe medium developed,\u2014to some extent under his guidance perhaps,\u2014\nwith the ripening of their acquaintanceship. From the end of\nFebruary, 1901, onwards manifestations, at some of which members\nof the family in which she lived are alleged to have been present, were\nonly occasionally absent from the seances. Until the box-experiment\nmentioned above there was, however, no attempt at supervision.\nFrom the statements of the medium and her fiance', it appears that the\nconditions of the later experiments, with which we are more especially\n\fMAY, 1902.] The Passage of Matter Through Matter. 227\nconcerned, were as follows : the glasses and rings were provided as a\nrule by the fiance' ; (it is, however, alleged that these were sometimes\nreplaced by \" apports \") ; they were placed in the medium's bedroom\nand in the morning the completed objects were found. There was no\nattempt at supervision. Conditions being wholly absent, the good faith\nof the experimenters, as such, need not be called in question, but merely\ntheir worldly wisdom and capacity for gauging the limits of mechanical\ningenuity.\nThose responsible for the experiments regard them as a clear proof of\nthe passage of matter through matter. Their claim is invalid, unless the\nobjects are of such a character that human ingenuity could not\npossibly produce them. It is hardly necessary to point out that the\nextreme laxity, or rather complete absence, of control in the case before\nus would make it possible for some person secretly, while the medium\nwas entranced, either (1) to put together by normal means the objects\nprovided ; or (2) to substitute for the objects provided, a ready-made\narticle. This state of things made it unnecessary for me to prolong my\nstay in Berlin. It was improbable that I should be able to expose a\nfraud committed under these circumstances, and the only question\nreally at issue was whether the objects could be produced by normal\nmeans or not. That being so, I asked and obtained permission to bring\nto England the last object produced ; and this was subsequently\n\u2022exhibited at the General Meeting of the Society on January 31st,\n1902.\nThis object consists of two thin tablets of flexible wood, probably\nchestnut or holly, 12-5 cm. long, 2'5 mm. thick; their greatest breadth\nis about 7 cm. ; an approximately circular hole is cut in the centre of\neach, 4-7 cm. and 4'4 cm. in diameter; the tablets taper away towards\neach end, and the extremity of one is passed through the hole in the\ncentre of the other. Through the holes in these tablets are passed four\nliqueur or wine-glasses (A,B,C,D) and a wooden egg-cup (E), disposed\nas follows : A and B are passed through one single hole, D and E through\nboth holes, and C through the other single hole. The arrangement is\nsuch that the withdrawal of either D or E would enable us to release\nthe remainder ; there is, however, no way of doing this directly while\nD and E remain intact ; at the same time it might be possible to find a\nmethod of liberating D and E indirectly by withdrawing one of the\nothers first. There are, therefore, two possibilities to be considered ; in\nthe first place one of the key pieces (D and E) may have been inserted\nin two pieces and joined up after the other glasses were in position ; or\nsecondly one of the other pieces may have been inserted in such a way\n\f228 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAY, 1902.\nas to lock the others ; the component parts being freely movable, it\nwould not be easy, if this original arrangement was once altered, to bring\nthem back to the key position, and the chance of detection would be\nsmall.\nI have mentioned above that one of the key pieces is glass ; it is clear\nthat if the stem were divided it would be an exceedingly difficult task\nto join it up with the blow-pipe without leaving any trace of manipula\ntion ; but small though the probability is that this, is the method by\nwhich the object was produced, we should not perhaps be justified in\ndisregarding it. In the case of the egg-cup, however, the operation\nwould be much simpler. There is a considerable thickness of wood at\nthe base of the bowl ; it would be quite possible to divide the stem\nbelow the bowl and, after sacrificing a little of the length, to join it\nup again in a manner that would defy detection, at any rate by mere\ninspection. It would only be necessary to bore the two portions, insert\na peg of the same kind of wood, make the grain correspond and fix\nwith some kind of glue.\nAn examination of the egg-cup discloses a state of things in no way\ninconsistent with this hypothesis ; at the base of the bowl is a deep cut,\nwhich does not under the microscope present the appearance of having\nbeen produced on the lathe, but might readily have been made in the\nway suggested. An examination with \"X rays \" disclosed no suspicious\nappearances, but it is clear that this is quite indecisive ; for with the\nmost ordinary precautions all danger of detection by this means could\nbe avoided ; if the glue were put on in a very thin layer or were not very\nmuch more opaque than the wood, we could hardly expect to discover\nany traces of it. It would, of course, be possible to test the truth of this\nhypothesis by more searching methods, such as soaking the construction\nin water. Having pledged myself, however, to return it in safety, I did\nnot consider myself at liberty to run any risks.\nIt was the less necessary to do so as, after a considerable amount of\nmanipulation, I discovered that it was possible to withdraw glass C\nwithout doing more violence than is involved in bending one of the\ntablets slightly. For the reason just mentioned, I did not feel at liberty\nto carry the experiment further ; I cannot, therefore, say definitely that\nthe withdrawal of this glass would enable the remainder to be released,\nbut it seems to me highly probable that it would. I shall be pleased\nto apply this and the test already mentioned if those in charge of the\nobject will return it to me with the necessary permission.\nIt appears, therefore, that there are at least two ways in which the\nobject in question could have been produced without the aid of super\n\fMAY, 1902.] The Passage of Matter Through Matter. 229\nnormal forces. I have already pointed out that the claim for super\nnormal influences was based,\u2014not on the care with which all normal\ncauses had been excluded, for no precautions of any kind were taken ;\nnor did it rest on the good faith of those responsible for the experi\nment, for they did not attempt to direct it ; nor on the good faith of\nthe medium, for she declares that she knows nothing of the way in\nwhich the object is produced. The claim for supernormal influences\nwas based wholly and solely on the impossibility of producing the\nobjects by normal means. Now it is obvious that before we can\nadmit the validity of such an argument, it must be quite clear that this\nis really impossible ; the margin of safety must be very large. In the\ncase before us, however, the margin of safety is not only not large, but\n\u2014as I have shown\u2014absolutely non-existent. There is not even a\npresumption that supernormal forces have been at work. Much less\ndoes it prove the passage of matter through matter. It is clear that\nthis is as much the case from the spiritualistic point of view as from any\nother. Even if supernormal forces have been at work, we have still no\nground for regarding the passage of matter through matter as proved\nby these or similar experiments, since all that would be necessary to\nproduce the effect would be a slight compression of some parts or a\nslight expansion of others. With this idea in mind I urged the\nexperimenters to undertake something which would, so far as we can see,\nbe a really decisive proof of the passage of matter through matter, such\nas the interlacing of two parchment rings. I was informed that the\ncontrol said it was too difficult. This may be so, but it is not\napparent why the molecules of parchment should be more difficult to\ndeal with than those of wood or glass. On the whole it seems safest\nto conclude that it is impossible, not because the molecular constitution\nis different, but because the chemical and mechanical methods which\nare effective in the case of glass, ivory, or wood are not available in the\ncase of parchment.\nTHE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF PSYCHOLOGY.\nTHE most recent number (January-February, 1902) of the Bulletin de\nI'lnstitut Psycliologique International contains the announcement of the\nformation of two special sections of the Institute, for the study respec\ntively of psychical phenomena and of animal psychology. The former\nsection, whose creation (says the report) has been from the beginning\none of the principal objects of the Institute, consists of the following\nmembers : Messrs. d'Arsonval, Bergson, Branly, Brissaud, Duclaux,\n\f230 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAY, 1902.\nMarey, and Weiss, M. Duclaux having been elected President. The\naim of the section is to explore that region on the borders of psycho\nlogy, biology, and physics where forces as yet undefined appear occa\nsionally to be manifest. It intends to enter on the research without\nbias or preconception, and with the sole aim of submitting to experi\nence the question, \"What is objectively real, and what is capable of\nsubjective interpretation, in the facts described under the names of\nmental suggestion, telepathy, mediumship, levitation, etc.? \" It main\ntains that this question can only be answered through the application\nof such methods of precise observation and rigorous experimentation\nas are practised in laboratories, and a hope is expressed that the\nInstitute may before long be able to provide rooms for experimental\ninvestigations. Meanwhile the members of the section propose, if\nnecessary, to use the laboratories to which, in their other capacities,\nthey have access.\nIt is satisfactory to note this evidence of active interest on the part\nof the Institute in psychical studies, and we shall look forward hope\nfully to the results which may be attained by the eminent men who\nhave joined the psychical section. We trust, however, that in the\nendeavour to perfect methods of research, they will not be tempted to\nneglect existing materials for a research which so far has not been found\nto lend itself to the methods used in laboratories for the investigation\nof phenomena of a different kind. The most important positive results\nhitherto reached in this subject have been gained through first collect\ning material and afterwards evolving suitable scientific methods of\ndealing with it ; not by trying to force it into the limited grooves of\nspecialised scientific procedures evolved to meet different requirements.\nMIND READING AND ALLIED PHENOMENA.\nPERSONAL EXPERIENCES OF C.\n(Continued from the March Journal, page 208.)\n(20) In 1892 [C.] was preparing a paper for the Psychical Congress of\nthe Chicago Exposition. To oblige a friend, he went on December 30th\nof that year to a certain Senr. Nascimento, a consulting medium, in order\nto obtain diagnoses and some homreopathic medicine. It was between\n4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon when Senr. Nascimento took up the\npencil to satisfy C.'s request. Being afterwards questioned as to the\nprospects that awaited C.'s paper, he wrote, \" Sempre que podemos, temos\nprazer em aimliar os trabalhadores de Ifia i-ontade. D. Cruz. (Whenever\n\fMAY, 1902.] Mind Reading and Allied Phenomena. 231\nwe can, we are always pleased to help those who work with a will. D.\nCruz.)\" This alone was not satisfactory to C. He noticed, however, a\nslight tremor in the medium's hand, as if further communication were\nintended. Then came, with the letters less sloped and in much slower\nwriting, \" Se me for permetida [sic] tambem pagarei minha dimda de\ngratidao. Dora. (If I am allowed, I will also pay my debt of gratitude.\nDora.)\" C. could recollect no one of the name of Dora, and said so.\nThe pencil continued : \" Lembra-se da pequena crianqa de Hampton Road.\n(Remember the little child of Hampton Road.)\" Now, Senr. Nascimento\nknew nothing whatever of English, and C. was at once struck with the\nEnglish construction of \"pequena crianfa.\" The diminutive form crian-\ncinha would be almost invariably used ; and, if not, the adjective would\nfollow its substantive. \" Hampton Road \" was really an approximation\nto the name of a street in London where a large board-school exists,\nwhich some three years before had been visited by C. His memory\nreverted to that period. On the occasion of his visit the conversation\nhad fallen at lunch-time on the poverty existing in the neighbourhood,\nit being affirmed that some of the children attending the school were\ntoo hungry to be able to learn. With some diffidence, for he was\nafraid of giving offence, he had offered a gift in money to the kind head\nmistress, who gladly accepted it, saying that it would be spent in\npenny dinners. On leaving the lunch-room some half dozen of the\npoorest girls were presented to him. Stroking the head of one who\nwas deeply pockmarked, and who seemed to show most the blighting\neffect of unfavourable environment, he spoke a few words to them, and\nthen returned to the work that was going on in the class-rooms. Re\ncalling this incident, C. conjectured that the message might be from\none of these little ones. He told Senr. Nascimento what had happened\nat the school, and insisted on his writing a syllable wanting in the\nname \"Hampton.\" This the medium could not obtain, but his hand\nsoon wrote, in letters that towards the end became bolder and more\nregular, \" Eu sempre disse assim. En Ihe sou devedwa de affagos que me\nfez. Qwndo deixei o corpo, vim aqui encontral-o. (I always said so. I\nam grateful to you for your caresses. When I left the body I came\nhere to meet you.)\" It was just possible, but not at all probable, that\nthe ,poor people in the neighbourhood of the school had a habit of\nsuppressing the first syllable of the above name. As for \" caresses \"\u2014\nand in the plural\u2014C. could think of nothing worthy of the name,\nunless it were the stroking of the girl's head. The word might have\nbeen more freely translated \"kindness,\" which would perhaps have\nbeen nearer the idea which the medium should have transmitted.\n\f232 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAY, 190-2.\nAt C.'s request inquiries were made by a Mr. D., resident in London.\nHe corresponded with, and saw personally, the head mistress of the\nschool above referred to. After consulting her registers, the latter\nwrote to Mr. D., saying : \" Dorothy Potter was the only child called\n' Dora ' on the registers of the school when C. called on us. She was\nvery poor at that time, old looking for her years, and seemed as if she\nhad a weight of care always upon her. Her father was ill\u2014in fact, I\nthink he was in the hospital about that time\u2014and I might have\nspecially mentioned her, although I have no certain remembrance of\ndoing so. She and her sister always shared in the dinners until her\nfather recovered. Some friends of the mother's then helped them, and\nthey went out of this district to live beside those friends, so that I have\nlost sight of them.\" Unfortunately, it was not found feasible to trace\nDorothy Potter any farther ; but, as Mr. D. remarked in forwarding\nthe above information, \" the chances are that the child did not weather\nthe storms of this life for long.\" Even had the mistress presented the\ngirl to C. by name, which is very doubtful, it would have been given\nas \"Dorothy,\" and not \"Dora.\" For this and other reasons C. does\nnot think that the explanation by a transferred unconscious memory is\napplicable in this case.\n[C.'s paper concludes with a description of a supposed personation\nof a recently deceased man by a young girl, who did not know him, in\na trance. The personation was not very detailed, some gestures and\nattitudes only of the deceased man being reproduced. As already\nmentioned, the whole paper, of which select portions only have been\nprinted in the Journal, will be preserved at the rooms of the Society\nand be there accessible to students.]\nCASE.\nG. 268. Dream.\nFor the following case of a dream coinciding with the arrival of news\nof a death we are indebted to Mr. Andrew Lang. The first account of\nthe case was sent to Mr. Lang by Mr. Alexander B. Bell, of 102\nHarcourt Road, Sheffield, who wrote to him as follows :\nDear Sir, Deer. 4th, 1901.\nAn odd case of dream coincidence came to my knowledge the other day,\nwhich it occurred to me you might be glad to know of, as you are interested\nin such matters.

On Monday morning, when between sleeping and waking, he\ndreamt that George Lohmaim was dead. At breakfast, he mentioned the\nmatter to his wife, as such an odd thing to dream about, seeing Lohmann's\nname had not been before the public in any way, nor in his own mind,\nfor a considerable time. Then he went down to the office, and the first\nnews that greeted him on entering was that of Lohmann's death. . . .\nALEXANDER B. BELL.\nMr. Lang wrote asking for a first-hand account from Mr. Brierley,\nand Mr. Bell replied as follows :\nDear Sir, December llth, 1901.\nI am sorry for the delay in answering your letter ; but I only\ngot the enclosed from Mr. Brierley last night. In order to make sure\nwhether he might or might not have heard the news subconsciously, I asked\nour sporting sub-editor what time the telegram announcing the death came\nin. He says about half-past twelve (midnight). It was just in time for our\nfirst edition. I did not say why I asked him, so he had no inducement to\nstretch a point to make things fit in, as one is apt to do in such cases.\nPerhaps I ought to say that I am on the editorial staff of the Sheffield\nTelegraph myself. . . . ALEXANDER B. BELL.\nMr. Brierley's account enclosed was as follows :\nMr. Bell kindly tells me that you are much interested in my dream con\ncerning the death of Lohmann, and for what it may be worth I have\npleasure in briefly relating what happened.\nShortly before seven o'clock on the morning of December 2nd I awoke,\nbut, not being under the necessity of rising early, I went off to sleep again,\nand it was during this period that I dreamt Lohmann had died\u2014I had no\nimpression where, although I knew he was in South Africa\u2014and I had to\nwrite a sketch of his career. I saw him playing again, and he was focussed\nvery clearly before me in the act of delivering the ball. This, with a\nmemory of the first match in which I ever saw him,\u2014the second match\nbetween the sixth Australian team and Shaw and Shrewsbury's Eleven that\nhad been in the Antipodes the previous year, played at Old Trafford on\nSeptember 13, 14, and 15, 1888, when he and Briggs dismissed the whole\nside for 35,\u2014left a very vivid impression upon me when I awakened, and\nalthough I attached no significance to the dream, remembering the nature of\nmy work, I mentioned the incident to my wife when I got down. At that\ntime, of course, news of Lohmann's death was in the papers, but as I had\nleft the office the previous evening by half-past nine, at which hour the\ncable message had not come through, I was in ignorance of it. Curiously\nenough, I did not see a paper that morning until I reached the office, and\nthe first words that were addressed to me were, \"Do you know George\nLohmann is dead ? \"\nI had not sought to trace any meaning to it, looking upon it merely as a\nremarkable coincidence, but, as was pointed out by one of my colleagues to\n\f234- Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

A. BRIERLEY.\nThrough the kindness of Mr. Bell, we obtained later the following\ncorroboration from Mrs. Brierley ; this was enclosed in a letter dated\nDecember 23rd, 1901 :\nAll that I can say with regard to Mr. Brierley's account of his dream is\nthat, just before sitting down to breakfast on the morning he mentions, he\nalluded to the fact that he had had a singular fancy in his sleep- -that he\nhad dreamt Lohmann, the cricketer, was dead, that he had to write an\nobituary notice of him, and other things which he has detailed in his own\ncommunication. That he did so relate this to me at that time, I have the\nclearest recollection. (Signed) LOUIE BRIERLEY.\nMr. Bell added the following information about Mr. Lohmann :\n. . . Mr. George Lohmaun ended his connection with English cricket in\n1896, I believe. He was in England with the South African team this\nsummer, however, and sailed for South Africa again about the end of\nAugust, or perhaps it might be in September. From that time till his\ndeath, his name had quite dropped out of the English papers.\nIn the Times of December 2nd, 1901, under Eeuter's telegram from\nCape Town, dated yesterday, is the following : \" G.

H. ARTHUR SMITH.\n\fMAT, 1902.] An Epidemic of Hallucinations. 235\nAN EPIDEMIC OF HALLUCINATIONS.\nThe following account is quoted by permission from Folklore for\nDecember, 1901 (Vol. XII. p. 455) :\nA SURVIVAL OF TREE-WORSHIP (Communicated by J. G. Frazer).\nIn this little-visited corner of Tuscany I have come across what appears\nto me a curious survival of tree-worship, or rather worship of a spirit of the\nwoods. I am spending the summer in a little village on the edge of the\ngreat chestnut forests which cover Mount Amiata, an isolated mountain\nrising from the Maremma. All summer a movement has been going on ;\nthe peasants going away by twos and threes at night and returning the\nnext day tired, but with a queer excited visionary look, which was so\nmarked that it excited my cariosity. At first they were unwilling to say\nmuch, only that they had been to visit the Madonna in an oak tree ; but as\nI have become well known, they grow more communicative, and enter into\nparticulars. They walk to a certain valley, and there they assert that a lady\n(the Madonna, as they believe) appeal's in an oak-tree. They spend the\nnight in a sort of ecstasy, of which they can tell little, except that it leaves\nthem \" contentissimi.\" This has been going on all the summer, and some\ntimes there are several thousand people on the spot. When one sees them\ngoing off after their hard day's work, under the Italian sun, to take first a\nwalk of four hours from here (many come from much further), and then to\nspend the whole night in this way, one cannot help feeling that some strong\ninstinct or feeling must draw them.\nThe Church discourages the whole thing ; the archpriest of Santafiora\ngoes so far as to assert that it is a work of the devil, but that would be his\nview of any survival of the worship of the wood spirits. The people, though\npious Catholics, will not be prevented from going to their oak-tree ; they are\npersuaded it is the Madonna. The Government, which dislikes any religious\nferment among the people, has sent the carabinieri once, who tore down the\nofferings which the poor people had hung on the tree, and threw down and\ntrampled on the candles they had fixed on it ; but this only irritated the\nbelievers. They threaten now to cut down the oak, and post carabinieri on\nthe spot ; so the whole thing may soon be put down, and you may like to\nknow about it while it is still going on.\nPeasants are not good hands at describing sensations ; about their visions\nthey can only say they see a strange light, and the Madonna appears, and\nthey see, or she tells them, wonderful beautiful things. It is all vague as to\ndetail, but not so as to the sentiment, or as to the vision. Owing to its\nisolation, surrounded by the deadly Maremma, the people of this mountain\nare particularly primitive ; but an electric tram is threatened, so one had\nbetter study them at once, as that will banish the spirits.\nMART LOVETT CAMERON.\nLa Bagnore, Arcidosso, Prov. di Grosetto,\nItaly, 12th Aug., 1901.\n\f236 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAY, 1902.\nIn the next number of Folklore (Vol. XIII., No. 1, March, 1902),\nappeared a note by Mr. Andrew Lang, which we are also allowed to\nquote, suggesting that the case was really analogous (as will probably\nhave occurred to our readers) to the one reported by M. Marillier\nin our Proceedings, Vol. VII., p. 100.\nTREE WORSHIP.\nI venture to suggest that this curious case of collective hallucination, by\nnight, of the Madonna in an oak-tree, is neither one of \"tree-worship\" nor\nof worship of \"wood spirits.\" In the Dordogne, in the eighties of the last\n(nineteenth) century, the French peasants used to gaze for, and some used to\n\" see,\" the Madonna in a dark hole in a wall, an ordinary field wall. M.\nMarillier communicated a paper on the subject to the Proceedings of the\nSociety for Psychical Research. Perhaps nobody will call this \"stone\nworship\"? I give an analogous case. Last autumn a friend of mine, a\nscientifically-trained man, having heard of \" crystal-gazing,\" made several\nexperiments. To prevent the existence of reflections in glass or water he\ntook a common table glass water-jug, surrounded it with dark cloth, covered\nhis own head with a cloth, and gazed down into the neck of the jug, which\nthus became a perfectly dark funnel, answering to the dark hole in the wall\nin the Dordogne. He found that the funnel became full of brilliant light,\nin which he viewed pictures of people and landscapes. I was present at\nthis experiment, and tried the funnel, which was quite black. He then\ntried the common glass ball in the usual way, with similar results. My\nfriend is a young athlete in good training, and has this peculiarity, that he\nnever once has dreamed, as far as his conscious memory goes. I therefore\nsubmit that both the hole in the wall and the dark nocturnal oak are mere\ngazing points, like the dark funnel, and that religious suggestibility did the\nrest. The Knock case in Ireland is really more curious ; here the visions of\nsaints and the bright lights were witnessed by the people of Knock both\nby day and at night, on the outside wall of the parish church (Catholic).\nWood spirits and tree worship are not in question, I think. A. LANG.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n[ The Editor in not responsible for opinion* expressed by Correspondentx.]\nPROFESSOR HYSLOP'S REPORT ON MRS. PIPER.\nTo the Editor of the\nJOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nFebruary 15th, 1902.\nSo far, I have not noticed any reference to the peculiar attitude assumed by\nProfessor Hyslop and Dr. Hodgson in regard to the \"mode of life\" of\nImperator and his friends. I happen to be one of the unscientific worms\ntrodden upon so vigorously by Professor Hyslop on pages 244-247 and 200\n\fMAY, 1902.] Correspondence. 237\nin his report, because we say : \" Spiritism cannot be accepted or proved\nuntil we know something about the conditions of life in the transcendental\nworld alleged as a consequence of these experiments.\" Professor Hyslop\nbases his objection to enquiries about the mode of life of the alleged spirits\non \" the necessary insolubility of the problem in any such terms as they [the\nmajority of mankind] have been accustomed to represent their knowledge \"\n(page 246). Professor Hyslop also says : \" Statements about a discarnate\nlife are, of course, worthless as evidence, because they are unverifiable, and\neven if veracious, are in addition not necessarily intelligible\" (page 247).\nThese seem to me to be surprising statements to be made by a Professor of\nLogic, especially such a capable and clear-headed one as Professor Hyslop's\nreport on Mrs. Piper proves him to be ; and my desire ill writing this\nletter is to insist that Professor Hyslop and those who think with him have\nmissed the point of the unscientific worms' argument. Let me state it in a\nway that will give no further excuse for it being ignored.\nAs Professor Hyslop says on page 246, there are two problems : (1) the\nexistence of spirits, (2) their mode of life. That is to say, there is a subjec\ntive side and an objective side to the enquiry. We have first to ask, \" Who\nare you ? \" And then, as I and the other unscientific worms maintain, but\nas Professor Hyslop denies, \" Where are you ? \" Necessarily, \" Who are\nyou?\" comes first; but as soon as there is prima facie evidence of spirit\nidentity (as Drs. Hodgson and Hyslop now contend), then the second aspect\nof the problem, \"Where are you?\" should be attacked. And for this\nreason ;\u2014a reason, judging by his attitude, entirely overlooked by Professor\nHyslop,\u2014that the question of \" Where are you I \" (or more strictly, \" Under\nwhat conditions do you exist ?\") is the crucial test of the genuineness of the\nspirits. If they are real spirits, it will be impossible to involve them in\nobvious contradictions. Many of their statements may not be intelligible to\nus, but they will not be contradictory, and if apparently so, the contradic\ntions will be resolved by further explanations. If, on the other hand, they\nare not real spirits, then, as the construction of a universe, even in its\nsmallest fragment, is an infinite problem, it will be impossible for any finite\nincarnate mind, either primary or secondary, to construct by an effort of the\nimagination a spiritual world consistent with itself, or consistent with what\nwe know of the physical universe. In Professor Hyslop's own words (page\n278) : \" When it reaches the point of supposing such a world, it is haunted\nwith the oracular obscurity and contradictions of the natural ignorance\nof any brain on such a subject, as well as the limitations of supraliminal\nexperience.\"\nAs the champion of the unscientific worms, I may give one illustration of\nour argument. Imperator and his friends repeatedly speak of the medium,\nor something connected with her, as \" the light.\" \" How can we manage\nthe light without thee, friend 1\" \" The light is failing.\" \" We will restore\nthis light a little.\" \" We will use the light.\" \" We cannot possibly hold\nthe light, it is going out, and we must go with it.\" \" Friend, the light is\ngoing out with us.\"\n\f238 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAY, 1902.\nThis, of course, is incomprehensible, but it is not inapprehensible, and it\ncertainly is not inconceivable, and it seems to me to be strikingly vrai-\nsemblable. It is not an idea that would readily occur to an incarnate mind,\nprimary or secondary, and it is stated so persistently, and on such seemingly\nproper occasions, that it leaves a favourable impression. Other statements\nby the Imperator group are, I am sorry to say, far from being as satisfactory\nas this. For instance, the assertion that spirits have etherial bodies the\nexact counterparts of our physical bodies is, prima facie at any rate, and in\nthe form in which it has hitherto been stated, sheer nonsense. As the\nstatement stands, without further explanations, it is full of absurdities and\ncontradictions. If Imperator is a real spirit, he will be able to give such\nexplanations as will make the statement, if not acceptable, at least not incon\nceivable to rational beings. If he is merely a secondary personality, then he\nwill not be able to do so.\nWe are merely demanding the right of cross-examination. Imperator and\nhis friends all guarantee each other's genuineness, and if they do not submit\nsatisfactorily to the test of cross-examination, so much the worse for them\nand their pretensions. In any case, Professor Hyslop is not justified in\ndevoting 250 pages to special pleading in favour of spiritism, and at the\nsame time trying to suppress enquiry along the one line that holds out a\nreasonable prospect of testing the genuineness of the spirits. Surely Im\nperator might spare a few moments of his august time to answer one simple,\nelementary, plain, little question, namely :\nHow did Imperator cross the Atlantic ?\nHow effective such a cross-examination would be is shown by the peep\nbehind the scenes afforded by Mrs. Sidgwick's paper in Part XXXVI. of\nthe Proceedings. We would like again to hear \" Sir Walter Scott \" on the\nsubject of \" Monkeys in the Sun,\" and Imperator's luminiferous remarks\nabout the composition of our etherial bodies warrant us in looking forward\nto a scientific treat when he again discourses on that subject. Those who\nare inclined to grow enthusiastic over Professor Hyslop's report would do\nwell to read Mrs. Sidgwick's paper once more. Why has the evidence to\nwhich Mrs. Sidgwick refers not been published in its due sequence ?\nDONALD MURRAY.\nON \"AN ALLEGED CASE OF ELONGATION.\"\n[The following comments on a case printed in the Journal for July,\n1901, have been sent to us by an Associate of the American Branch,\nwho suggests\u2014on the hypothesis that the \" elongation \" was the result\n\u2022of trickery\u2014three possible methods by which it might have been\naccomplished. It would be a useful work for members who have some\nskill and experience in conjuring, to try whether, by some such method,\nand under similar conditions, the effect described could be reproduced.\n\u2014EDITOR.]\n\fMAY, 190-2.] On \"An Alleged Case of Elongation.\" 239\n(1) We are told (p. 107, Hue 20) that he \"appeared to be drawn upwards\nby his hands \"\u2014which were stretched \" straight out above his head.\" Now\nare we sure that his hands could reach nothing sufficiently substantial to\nenable him to raise his body in this way ? Of this we are told nothing\ndefinite. The ceiling of the \" bow window \" was lower by six inches than\nthat of the remainder of the room ; and there were curtains separating them.\nOn what were the curtains hung ? On a rod\u2014as is usually the case ? And\nif so, would this rod be sufficiently substantial to sustain the medium's\nweight, assisted, perhaps, by one or both feet ? As for the hands seen\nagainst the ceiling, they may have been the medium's shown alternately\u2014be,\nmeanwhile, supporting himself with the other hand. The objection to this\nhypothesis is that the medium's feet were held, and on this basis they would\nnecessarily have to be free. When we read that the medium's \" feet \" were\nheld, we must presume, in this case at least, that it was his shoes that were\nso held\u2014and very insecurely at that. I would suggest, therefore, either\nthat the medium slipped out of his shoes and left them under the careful\nsupervision of his guardians while he \"elongated\" himself as above de\nscribed ; or that dummy feet were substituted, whilst his own followed the\nrest of his body, as they would under ordinary circumstances.\n(2) My second hypothesis is that dummy feet were substituted, or his\nshoes left under observation, as above described, and that the medium\nmounted, in some way, by means of his stocking feet. This would cause his\nbody to be elevated from the floor to the extent described, and enable his\narms to be seen against the ceiling, as they would really be at that height\nfrom the ground floor. The question is, on what did the medium find a foot\nhold ? We read (p. 108) \" the only chair near (D) I pushed away when the\nmedium began to sway backwards and forwards, fearing he would knock\nhimself against it.\" On the other hand the chairs at A and B were not\nmoved during the whole phenomenon\u2014\" we none of us moved from our\nchairs during the whole time \" (note under diagram). The distance from D\n(the medium's position) does not appear to be more than a few inches (under\none foot, at any rate), if the diagram is drawn to scale. One other suspicious\npoint in favour of this hypothesis is the following : \" On my attempting to\nrise from my chair the ' Indian ' requested me to remain seated.\" On one\nhypothesis this is comprehensible\u2014if the medium's feet were on the rungs of\nthe chair, the latter would slip if the occupant rose therefrom. One other\nitem. In speaking of the position of furniture, etc., in the room, we see (p.\n108, last lines) that \" a small inlaid writing bureau with sloping lid [sepa\nrated the medium] from the edge of the curtain on his left.\" This would\nevidently be only a few inches from the medium's position also, and might\nhave afforded some additional foothold. Finally, it must be remembered\nthat the attention of the investigators seems to have been almost entirely\nconcentrated on the medium's arms and the upper portion of his body ; he,\nno doubt, attracting attention thereto, as he seems to have done with his\n\" patter \" and continued calling of attention to the length and direction of the\narms. Thus, \" The ' Red Indian ' (who was controlling) called to us then to\n\f240 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAY, 1902.\nobserve his hands, one arm . . . being quite six inches longer than the\nother. . . . Again our attention was directed to the fact that the shorter\narm had been elongated to match the other.\" Here, at any rate, the \" con\ntrol \" makes deliberate attempts to attract attention to the upper part of the\nbody, whereas the investigators were only \" conscious \" that their feet rested\non those of the medium. From their strained position, observation must\nhave been next to impossible. As to the lengthening of the arms (first one\nand then the other), I venture to suggest that a mere natural extension of\none and contraction of the other would have appeared to give that result.\nFor we read, \" from our position this was difficult for my brother and me to\nsee, but was quite apparent to Mrs. S. at (C).\" But Mrs. S. was seated \" at\nleast four feet from the medium,\" and we must remember that the light was\nexceedingly bad (as it appears), and Mr. S. (at B), was probably between the\nmedium and the lamp, to a certain extent, from the very nature of his\nposition.\n(3) My third hypothesis I admit to be exceedingly improbable ; but it is,\nto my mind, more conceivable than a genuine manifestation of the pheno\nmenon of \" elongation.\" It is that the medium employed dummy arms to\ndisplay against the background of the ceiling, and that -some sliding\nmechanism was attached to his body, which, being elevated, would carry the\ninvestigator's hands along with it (his feet remaining on the floor), and thus\ngive the sensation of moving the whole upper part of the medium's body.\nIt will be observed that only the medium's hands and arms were actually\nseen to be at an unusual distance from the floor\u2014nothing is said of the body\nbeing seen in its elevated position\u2014it is merely inferred from the sense of\ntouch.\nTaking now the three hypotheses here advanced as an explanation of the\nalleged case of \" Elongation \" reported in the July Journal, it is admitted\nthat each and every one of these is a severe strain on our credulity. The\nquestion is simply this : Knowing what we do of the fallacies of human\nobservation, and the scope of fraud, are we justified in thinking that the\nhypothesis of trickery here advanced is more inconceivable than the actual\nphenomenon of elongation itself ? Speaking personally, the former explana\ntion is to me the more thinkable of the two, and while wavering to some\nextent between the three hypotheses here offered, I am inclined to accept\nthe second as that which strains the evidence (and our credulity) least.\nBut a more detailed account is needed before anything definite can be\ndecided upon, either for or against the genuineness of the phenomenon.\nHEKEWARD CARRINGTON.\n\fNo. CXC.\u2014VOL.

N. HALES.\nSOME years ago a curious case of what appeared to be thought-reading\non the part of a child of about six years old was published in the Annales\ndes Sciences Psyehiques (November-December, 1894), and a brief note\nsummarising the account was printed in the Journal for February, 1895\n(Vol. VII. p. 29). The case had originally been communicated in 1893\nto the SocUt6 de MMecine d'Angers by Dr. Quintard, whose report of his\npersonal observations was confirmed at the time by Dr. Tesson. Dr.\nPetrucci, Director of the Asylum of Maine-et-Loire, and several other\nmedical men also examined the percipient (who was called Ludovic\nX.), and apparently found no flaw in the report of his powers.\nDr. Quintard stated that Ludovic X. showed promise at the age of\nfive years of rivalling the feats of the most celebrated \"calculating boys.\"\nWhen his mother began to teach him the multiplication table, she\nfound that he could say it as well as she could, and he gave without a\npause correct answers to the most complicated problems in mental\narithmetic. An intuitive faculty for languages, as well as for mathe\nmatics, seemed to be developed in this infant prodigy, who would\ntranslate at hearing any sentence in English, Spanish or Greek, and\ngave a satisfactory solution of a Latin riddle. To the disappointment\nof his parents and friends, these apparently remarkable powers turned\nout later to be due to \" mere telepathy.\" It was almost always necessary\nthat his mother should fix her mind on the right answer to the problem,\nwhatever it was, before he could give it, and he could repeat equally\nwell anything else that she was thinking of, such as a given number or\nword, or a card drawn from a pack. His unerring capacity for guessing\nhis mother's thoughts was found to be a serious drawback when she\n\f242 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JUNE, 1902.\ntried to teach him to read. He read from her mind instead of from the\nbook, and exercising neither his judgment nor his memory, made no\nprogress. Ingenious devices had to be resorted to to baffle him, and\neverything was done to discourage and stifle the \" telepathic \" power\non the advice of Dr. Quintard, who wrote to Dr. Dariex (editor of the\nAnnales) in September, 1894, that it seemed to be gradually disappear\ning; on some days Ludovic X. could only guess the beginnings of\nwords, instead of the whole of them.\nThe case excited a good deal of interest at the time. It was\n\"boomed\" by the daily press; it was looked upon as a scientific\ndiscovery of the first importance by amateurs of the uncanny ; it\nattracted the attention of Charcot and Gilles de la Tourette. Finally\nit was enshrined as an indubitable fact \" avec toutes les garanties\nd'authenticit6 \" in M. Camille Flammarion's L'Inconnu et les Problemes\nPsychiques (p. 352) and even briefly summarised in Mr. F. Podmore's\nStudies in Psychical Research (p. 211).\nDuring a visit to Angers early in 1901, I took the opportunity of\nmaking all possible enquiries on the spot, and saw the principal\nwitness, Dr. Quintard. I came to the conclusion that there was\nreally no evidence for thought-transference in the case, but that the\nchild's success in guessing probably depended on unconscious and\ninvoluntary whispering by his mother of the words to be guessed.\nThe case is interesting, not only as proving once more the un\nreliability of certain species of evidence, but because it probably\naffords an illustration of a possible source of error in telepathic\nexperiments which was long ago emphasised by members of our\nSociety (e.g. by Mr. Gurney in Phantasms of the Living, Vol. I. p. 18,\nand by Professor and Mrs. Sidgwick in Proceedings, Vol. VI. p. 164),\nbut the danger of which is likely to be overlooked by inexperienced\ninvestigators, in spite of Hansen and Lehmann's later experiments in\ninvoluntary whispering. The present is, however, perhaps the only\ncase published and long accepted as genuine, in which subsequent\nevidence affords a prima facie presumption that the results were due\nto this source of error. It has therefore been thought worth while for\nme to give the results of my investigation at length.\nI was greatly helped in obtaining information by the kind efforts of\nM. Lestang, Directeur de PEcole Normale d'Instituteurs d'Angers,\nwho gave me introductions to some of the persons concerned, and\nhimself endeavoured to obtain further evidence from others. The case\nwas curiously complicated by various personal considerations\u2014political\nand other\u2014entirely unconnected with the evidential aspect, and these\n\fJUNE, 1902.] A Case of supposed Thought-Reading. 243\nformed the greatest obstacle to the investigation. On January 10th,\n1901, I succeeded in interviewing Dr. Quintard, and I quote the\nfollowing from my notes of the interview, written the next day.\nI was not specially well received. I told him my business. He said that\nin his article everything had been said, and there was no need for more\nprecise details. He had received numberless letters about it, all proposing\ndifferent theories, and all asking different questions. In spite of this\ninauspicious beginning, however, I managed to get all my questions\nanswered, and elicited a lot of information, probably authentic, which is\nnot to be found in the original article. We parted the best of friends, and\nit was somewhat difficult for me to get away. He assured me he would be\nonly too glad to answer any question I would like to ask.\nMy questions had in view two objects :\n(1) To find out whether there was any clairvoyance in the matter, as dis\ntinguished from thought-transference.\n(2) Of what kind the thought-transference, if any, might be.\nAnother even more important question was to decide what relation the\nwords uttered by the child bore to the state of his general knowledge.\n(1) The mother's presence was in all cases altogether necessary. Thus,\nsupposing somebody wanted only to translate a foreign idiom, the mother\nwould have to know the translation, and the child would make precisely the\nsame mistakes which the mother fell into. Further, were the mother to\nverbalise an object and immediately leave the room, the child could not give\nithe answer. A certain time seemed to be required. So also a certain\nproximity. At 17 yards the child would begin to ' bredouiller ' indistinctly ;\n:at 13 a little more distinctly ; at 10 the word was complete. Again, place\nthe mother on one side of a door and the child on the other\u2014no transmission\ntook place. I forget whether other screens were used. Apparently the\n.child did not necessarily look towards the mother when answering ; and if\nshe kept her back turned upon him, the phenomenon took place nevertheless.\nA special point is that, out of a very large number of trials, there was never\none failure.\n(2) Of what kind was the thought-transference, and is lecture des pensdes\na proper term for it ? The phenomena began sporadically at the age of 4J,\nwhen the mother began to teach the child to read. They were subjected to\nnumerous experiments during the child's fifth year ; this process lasted six\nmonths. The father, fearing the child might never learn to exercise its\nfaculties of judgment, etc., and that it might become idiotic, endeavoured to\nput an end to these manifestations. From the age of seven they diminished.\nWhen, therefore, the child solved the complicated problems recorded, it\n.could not read, nor certainly calculate ; and had the number 38,196,000 been\nwritten on a piece of paper, it could not have read it. Similarly, it could\ntell what were the coins in a closed drawer\u2014Napoleons 1871, etc.\u2014provided\nthe mother knew, although it could not have counted the money nor have\nitold the difference of its own accord between a louis and a sou. The child\n\f244 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JUNE, 1902.\nwas never known to speak out the thoughts of the mother in ordinary life.\nAn ordinary train of thoughts, with its fringes and fugitive phases, did\nnot get expressed by the child ; but only substantive states, a word, a\nverbalised sentence. There appears to have been a clear difference between\nits usual way of talking and its \" thought-reading \" : in the latter case each\nsyllable would be pronounced se-par-ate-ly. Not only vocal automatism, but\nmuscular (writing to dictation) was observed. The child does not seem to\nhave had any visual images or transmission of visual images. Questioned\nas to what he thought about this, the father answered that he considered it\nprobable that there were no visual images ; there never seemed any\nevidence of any, although there is no strict proof that there were none.\nWas it a transmission of auditory images ? The experiments in dictation\nseem to prove that this was not the case. Ordinarily he made howlers\u2014\nwriting phonetically. With his mother he never made a mistake.\nDr. Quintard had spoken of \"very many\" experiments which had\nbeen made, and cited a few abstractly typical cases. He had mentioned,\ntoo, a fact which, if it could be shown to be genuine, would be of the\ngreatest possible importance : the child's writing to dictation correctly\nfor his mother, incorrectly for any one else. If I am compelled to say\nthat Dr. Quintard's conversation convicted him even more thoroughly\nthan the article in the Annales of being devoid of any notion of\nscientific method, it is because he mentioned this muscular automatism\nwithout appearing to appreciate its fundamental importance. What\nevidence could he adduce in proof of his assertions 1 Had any contem\nporary record been kept of the experiments ? Had any of the child's\nattempts at writing from dictation been preserved ? These questions\nDr. Quintard answered as follows :\nANGERS, 30 Janv., 1901.\nCher Monsieur Hales,\nJe reponds point pour point a votre honoree lettre du 28 courant,\nvous rep6tant ce que j'avais dejei eu 1'avantage de vous dire chez moi de vive\nvoix, que j'avais donn6 Pobservation aussi complete qu'il m'avait et6 possible,\nce qui vous expliquera pourquoi je solutionne negativement la plupart de\nvos questions, dont cependant j'appr6cie I'int6ret.\n1\u00b0.

QUINTARD.\nThis letter could hardly be considered satisfactory. If, at the end of\nsix or seven years, Dr. Quintard had forgotten the names of the\u2014not\nvery many\u2014medical men who came to witness the phenomena, is it not\nlikely that his other recollections might have gone through a process of\nselection 1 Dr. Hodgson's observations on the \" Possibilities of Mai-\nObservation \" exposed long ago the peculiar tricks our memory is liable\nto play us even when the interval between actual perception and recall\nis short, but after six or seven years who can compute the amount of\nsimplification a tale may have gone through at the two hundreth time\nof telling? Long ago, Dr. Quintard formed an opinion about the\nphenomena in question. He may at first have related them in all their\ncomplexity of detail. But it is tedious to go on repeating for ever the\nsame small circumstances which one is quite certain were unessential.\nSo by degrees they get omitted, and before long they are forgotten.\nFinally, the particular cases merge into one typical instance, but this\ntypical instance is a consequence of a theory ; and when we are offered\nsuch a typical instance as a proof, we can consider it as the proof of\nnothing but the workings of a particular mental organisation. In the\nabsence of any contemporary documents, the only evidence that could\nbe relied upon was that of the medical men who were quoted as having\nwitnessed the phenomena. And here it is just as well to enter a word\nof caution concerning the witness whom Dr. Quintard calls \" une grande\nautoriteV' I am not aware that, apart from this case, whose paternity,\nwe shall see, Dr. Petrucci does his best to repudiate, his fame has\nextended very far beyond the walls of St. Gemmes' Asylum. As to Dr.\nGuichard (Professor of Obstetrics at the Angers Medical School), it is\nperhaps not unfair to remind the reader that after all Angers is not\nParis, and Obstetrics has little to do with Psychology.\nGreat difficulties were experienced in getting evidence from the other\nwitnesses mentioned in the original account. Dr. Tesson left M.\nLestang's letters of enquiry unanswered, and was always out when he\ncalled. (\" La volont^ de faire le mort est manifeste,\" says M. Lestang\nat last.) Dr. Petrucci, who was stated by Dr. Quintard in the Annales\nto have been one of the doctors who witnessed experiments with the\nchild, refused to give M. Lestang a written account, but told him in\nan interview (described by M. Lestang in a letter to me) that he\n\f246 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JUNE, 1902.\nwas twice present at experiments made by the mother, which seemed\nto him inconclusive. They were not very successful, as the child only\nrepeated partially, and after many mistakes, the answers to problems,\nand the Latin words which his mother was trying to make him say.\nHe observed, further, gestures, movements of the lips, and semi-articu\nlate sounds on her part which the child might have interpreted. He\nthought the experimenters credulous persons, who, being convinced of\nthe supernormal nature of the phenomena, unconsciously assisted in\ntheir production. He represented Dr. Tesson as considering the whole\naffair to be \" a humbug.\" He said that Dr. Guichard had witnessed\nthe experiments, and took the same view of them that he did. Dr.\nGuichard held the child on his knees while the mother tried in vain to\ntransmit a Latin phrase to him. The child fidgeted a great deal, and\nat last said, \"A little louder, mamma; I can't hear.\" Dr. Petrucci\nsaid that it was merely out of friendship for Dr. Quintard that he and\nDr. Tesson had abstained from contradicting the printed reports in\nnewspapers,' etc., in which their names had appeared as corroborating\nhis account. They disbelieved the facts, but were unwilling to make\nany written statements on the subject.\nIn reply to a letter from myself, Dr. Pe'trucci wrote declining to\ncommit himself to any positive statement on the subject, and pleading\nas an excuse for his silence the obligations of the \" secret profes-\nsionnel.\"\nM. Lestang saw Dr. Guichard (Professor of Obstetrics at the Angers\nMedical School), and he promised to send a detailed account of what\nhe had witnessed. After a further request from me, this account\nwas received, and is printed below.\nDr. Guichard, in the letter accompanying it, states that he sent a\nsimilar report of the case at the time to Dr. Gilles de la Tourette, who\ncommunicated it to Professor Charcot.\nEXAMEN DBS FAITS.\nI.

A. GUICHARD.\nANGERS, le 9 novembre, 1901.\nThe first communication from Dr. Guichard was not as complete as\nmight have been wished. The explanation is arrived at somewhat too\neasily ; some of the data most essential to it are rather implied than\nexpressed. For instance, did Dr. Guichard actually observe the move\n\f248 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JCNE, 1902.\nments of the mother's lips ? Were these movements at all obvious 1\nCould he himself\u2014with his large experience in the deaf and dumb\nschool\u2014have read the words Madame X. was consciously or uncon\nsciously articulating ? These questions were all prima facie important,\nand all equally neglected by Dr. Guichard in his first report, which, he says,\nhad entirely satisfied Charcot and Gilles de la Tourette. In fact, it is\nhardly an exaggeration to assert that there is nothing in this report to\nindicate that Dr. Guichard's conclusion (\" Madame X. inconsciente, en\nfaisant les demandes a son fils, e'pelait avec ses levres les r^ponses, mais\nsans s'en rendre compte et par habitude \") is anything more than a\ngenial hypothesis. It is strange, I say, that Dr. Guichard should have\nmade no reference to vital facts which he was able subsequently to\ndescribe in so positive a manner. In reply to my questions, Dr.\nGuichard sent me the following supplementary details :\nJe tiens a dire dans quel ordre d'idees a et6 dirigg 1'examen des fails ; mon\nintention etait bien arr\u00a7tee d'observer separ6ment I'infant X., puis Monsieur\nQ., enfin Madame X. pour en induire la part que chacun pouvait prendre\ndans les faits a interpreter.\nJ'amrme\nI.

A. GUICHARD.\nANGERS, le 13 noveinbre, 1901.\nHowever this may be\u2014and we would not care to contest the assertion\n\u2014we can but regret that there are not sufficient data for estimating the\nvalue of Dr. Guichard's evidence. It is obvious that it sometimes\ncontradicts Dr. Quintard's. Whereas the one asserts the phenomena to\nhave taken place even when the child was not looking at Madame X.,\nor when Madame X.'s back was turned, the other is equally positive\nthat nothing came about unless the child looked at Madame X.\nEvidently both these accounts cannot be right, although they might\nboth be wrong. How many experiments did Dr. Guichard conduct,\nand on how many separate occasions ? We are not told. Both\naccounts agree at least in one respect, and that is fundamental. They\nboth deal exclusively in the typical, and the typical case is of course\nmoulded by a general theory about all the cases. What seems to be\nirrelevant detail is left out by both witnesses, and they have, of course,\ndifferent standards of relevancy. Their recollections appear to have\nbecome simplified, according to the same law, in the same degree,\nand in opposite directions. Dr. Quintard,\u2014always, I am told, inclined\nto look upon his relation to the universe as a very special one,\u2014liked the\nformula \"lecture des pensees.\" Dr. Guichard has seen something of\nthe Salpetriere, and heard of suggestion. The case seems to me one of\nthose in which the belief about a fact, and the process of growth of the\nbelief, are quite as important as the fact itself. The analysis of the\n\f250 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JUNE, 1902.\nprocess is not of course complete until we can form some positive\nnotion about the actual fact. If there was any thought-transference in\nthis case, it is impossible to prove. On the other hand, Dr. Guichard\nseems to us only less incompetent as an observer than Dr. Quintard. It\nwill be remembered that the former makes no mention in his reports of\nthe experience with which Dr. Petrucci credits him. \" A little louder,\nmamma, I can't hear.\" Is this an illusion of memory on Dr. P6trucci's\npart ? Or is this another \" typical \" case, a dramatic resum6 of Dr.\nGuichard's observations 1 We cannot, and perhaps we need not, decide\nwith certainty. But it is instructive to contrast the recollections\nof Dr. Quintard, according to which \"out of a very large number of\ntrials there was never one failure\"; with those of Dr. Guichard,\naccording to which there was never one genuine success.\nTHE FIRE-WALK IN MAURITIUS.\nFrom time to time accounts of the ceremony of the Fire-Walk, as\npractised in different parts of the world, have been printed in the\nJournal, in the hope of eliciting more numerous and more complete\nobservations by competent witnesses, which might help to solve the\nquestion whether any supernormal powers are really exhibited in the\nphenomenon. It is generally admitted in these accounts that the\nfire-walkers are not injured by the performance, and sceptical observers\nas a rule base their explanations of this supposed fact on one of two\nmain arguments\u2014maintaining either (1) that the feet of the fire-\nwalkers are protected by means of some kind of lotion ; or (2) that the\npart of the fire with which they come into contact is not actually so\nhot as it appears.\nWe have recently received an account from Mauritius, printed\nbelow, which takes a new line. The writer believes the fire to be\nreally hot, but he denies that the fire-walkers are not burnt. He also\nsuggests that the Fire-Walk is a self-torturing ceremony, like those to\nbe found in many other rituals. This suggestion seems to throw some\nlight on the subject, and the point is one which has, we believe, been\nmore or less overlooked by previous observers.\nMr. Piddington writes :\nApril 29th, 1902.\n\"I sent the Journal for December, 1901, containing Mrs. Schwabe's\naccount of fire-walking in Mauritius to my uncle, Mr. John Piddington,\nand asked him if he could throw any more light on the subject.\n\" My uncle has resided for nearly 50 years in the Mauritius, and is a\n\fJUNE, 1902.] The Fire- Walk in Mauritius. 251\nman of an accurate habit of mind, and he would not commit himself to\nstatements of fact nor to opinions without having first carefully enquired\ninto and studied the evidence. I enclose his letter. Some remarks\nin it are due to his misconception of the objects and methods of\nthe S.P.E., but they concern only the interpretation of the facts, and\nnot the facts themselves. I showed the letter yesterday (April 28, 1902)\nto a friend of mine, Mr. M. G. Jessett, who witnessed a fire-walking cere\nmony in Mauritius in 1 897, in the hope that he might be able to add\nsomething to the information contained in it. Unfortunately, as he ex\nplained to me, he went to the fire-walk simply for amusement and with no\nintention of making careful observations. He told me also that it was\nextremely difficult to get an unimpeded and continuous view of what\nwas going on, on account of the crowd and excitement. Mr. Jessett\nwatched the ceremony from the side furthest away from the finish, and\nso is not able to express any opinion as to the physical condition of the\ndevotees after completing their walk. He states, however, that a ' col\nlection' was made among the onlookers, though he himself was not per\nsonally invited to subscribe : but whether the collection was made before,\nduring, or after the ceremony, he cannot now remember. He also\nnoticed that the burning embers were carefully levelled. So far,\ntherefore, as Mr. Jessett is able to give any positive evidence, he\ncorroborates the statements made by my uncle.\n\"J. G. PlDDINGTON.\"\nThe account enclosed is as follows :\nMAURITIUS, Feb. 16th, 1902.\nYour principal object in writing seems to have been to ask me about fire-\nwalking, which Mrs. Schwabe writes about to your little journal. Her\ndescription of the ceremony is fairly accurate in general, but she makes\nmistakes, and so do you. For instance, I can never remember seeing a\ntrench as wide as 12 or 15 feet, and although I have never measured it, I\nshould fancy it is not much more than half that width, but that is beside the\nquestion and unimportant ; but it is less so that she only mentions the\n\" puddle \" after the fire, and says nothing of the one before it, which has\nperhaps a bearing on the question. The things are by no means puddles,\nbut are trenches filled with about 8 or 10 inches of water. She is also\nmistaken in saying that no money passes.. Thaumaturgists have ever had\nan eye to the main chance, and the hat is freely and actively passed round\nduring and after the ceremony by the priest \"for the goddess.\" Could you\nfind no parallel to this in newer and better religions than Buddhism ? The\npoor victims, of course, get nothing but the honour.\nMrs. Schwabe is also mistaken in supposing that the votaries are none the\nworse for walking upon hot coals. They are most decidedly the worse, as\nyou will see later, and the instance of her friend's servant coming to serve at\n\f252 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JUNE, 1902.\ntable after the walk must, if true, which I doubt, have been a piece of mere\nbravado. You make a mistake in speaking of hot stones as the things\nwalked upon ; they are red-hot wood embers\u2014charcoal in fact.\nSince I received your letter I have, in the hopes of adding to or correcting\nmy knowledge of the ceremony, questioned army doctors, civil doctors, Mr.\nTrotter, our \" Protector of immigrants,\" and a variety of people who ought\nto know, but have not learnt much that I did not know before, and I have\ncome to the conclusion that there is very little in the whole thing for\nwonder-mongers to feast upon ; but the man from whom I got what I\nconsider the most reliable information is our \" pion,\" or messenger and office\nman at the works. His name is Ackbar ; he is, of course, a Mohammedan,\nbut he was born here, and has lived all his life among those Hindoos who\npractise these self-torturing ceremonies. He has been in my service twenty-\nfive years, and, strange to say, he is not a liar.\nIt appears that in most cases the walk is the result of a vow, either in\ngratitude for some supposed blessing of the goddess, or to obtain such.\nThe man who is to walk is subjected to a training of a fortnight. This\ntraining is in no respect physical (I mean that no lotion is used to render\nthe feet insensible), but is directed towards exciting by every possible\nmeans the mind and the nervous system to the highest pitch, so that the\nvictims end on the day of the fire-walk by being in a state bordering\non frenzy.\nWhen the time comes, they first walk through the water trench before the\nfire, then on to the embers, over which they pass more or less rapidly,\nand then through the second pool. Then they go away in a state of\ncollapse to be nursed. Some are weak-kneed, and try to get out of the\nhot trench before the end. These are beaten back with sticks by the\npriests, who stand by the trench.\nThat these poor deluded victims do get badly burned is most certain, for\nthey have to lay up to recover from their burns for a period varying from a\nweek to a month.\nIn all this I do not see anything which cannot be explained without going\nto the supernatural. You must remember that Indians who have never\nworn shoes, and are the most indefatigable walkers on earth, have the soles\nof their feet covered with a layer of horn of enormous thickness. This is\nwell wetted by walking in the small pond preceding the fire trench, which\nnaturally delays the transmission of the heat somewhat. I have heard it\nsaid that a solution of alum is used to still further harden the horn, but I\nbelieve this is not so. But notwithstanding the stolidity of the fire-walkers\nthey sometimes feel the burns, and an instance was given me of this by Mr.\nTrotter. Great care is taken to rake the embers small and very flat, so that\nthe soles only may bear. In this case a large coal had been inadvertently\nleft, and the man putting his foot upon it, turned over on to his ankle,\nwhich got badly burned. This Mr. Trotter saw.\nYou must also take into account the love of a large portion of humanity\nfor making victims and martyrs of themselves. Do not Christian nuns\n\fJUNE, 1902.] The Fire-Walk in Mauritius. 253\nflay themselves till the blood runs, and Trappist monks wear hair shirts\n(I may be mistaken as to the Order, but the thing is done), and take all\nthis self-imposed punishment smiling, believing that it is a step towards\nParadise ? Now, Asiatics have this tendency highly developed. . Any day\nyou may see at the Gamse processions * men stick long pins through their\ncheeks and through their tongues horizontally, so that they cannot draw\nthem back into the mouth. Then they will pucker up the flesh of their\nbellies with finger and thumb, and stick the pin through the ruck. All this\nwithout the slightest symptoms of pain. Some stick the pins all over their\nbodies, until they begin to look like young porcupines. They then howl and\ndance. All devotees will tell you that in certain states of violent nervous\nexcitement, most kinds of pain are not felt. This explains what we have all\nheard as to soldiers in battle being riddled with bullets and not feeling any\nthing until touched in some vital part. Then they fall, and the reaction and\ncollapse follow, and the capacity for pain returns. Does not this explain\nwhat is commonly said that, on going into a dentist's room to have a tooth\ndrawn, the pain ceases on account of the flutter of excitement caused by the\napprehension of the operation ? I have experienced this many a time and\ntoo often.\nI shall be curious to know what you will say to all this. I am very\nrefractory to the supernatural, and always seek for natural explanations of\nphenomena I witness. I forgot to say that the approved treatment for\nthese burns is washing with an infusion of tamarind leaves, which are very\nastringent, and smearing with cocoanut oil when the blisters split and\nsuppurate, which frequently happens, as pretty complete collapse is known\nto follow the fire-walk. I am afraid that either the tale of the man waiting\nat table is a yarn, or if the man could stand upright it was a piece of\nbravado, but I incline to the first hypothesis.

LODGE'S PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS.\nTo the Editor of the\nJOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nDr. Lodge in his recent Presidential Address set himself to deal with a\nmatter of the utmost moment to our Society\u2014the bearing of modern\nPhysical Science upon Psychical Research. \" Let us therefore see,\" he says\n(p. 45), \" whether, in the light of our present knowledge of Physics, they\n[i.e. the traditional physical phenomena] are wholly impossible and absurd,\nso that no testimony could produce any effect on our incredulity.\" In\n* The Gams4 is a Mohammedan Feast,\n\f254 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [.TUNE, 1902.\n\u2022discharging his task, he has, as it seems to me, said either too little or too\nmuch. He must know that we look to him to justify for us, in the teeth\nof a hostile world of science, the inquiry that means so much to many of us\n\u2014if not to all. If I venture to animadvert upon his mode of handling\nthe question, it is because I am so deeply anxious to sit at his feet and\nlearn.\nDealing with materialisations, which he finds easier of belief than some\nothers of the physical phenomena, but which, naturally enough, he does not\npretend to understand, he expresses the opinion \"that they may after all\nrepresent only a singular and surprising modification of a known power\nof life.\" What is this known power of life 1 It is the power by which any\nanimal converts its food into muscle, hair, skin, bone, or feathers. He\nconceives it possible that an extra-mundane intelligence \" might for a time\nutilise the terrestrial particles which come in its way and make for itself a\nsort of material structure capable of appealing to our ordinary senses\"\n(p. 47). Now, what I for one shoxild dearly like to know is, upon what facts\nknown to modern science the Professor founds? Is there any trace of a\nliving creature controlling its own vital processes ? When it feeds, does it\nknow how it feeds ? Is it master of its own organic chemistry ? Can it\ndetermine the destination of any given particle to its microscopic place\nin flesh, or skin, or hair ? Even if such a creature were known to exist, or\nwere only shadowed forth as a coming possibility, how far would that help\nus to conceive of an intelligence, not possessed of a digestive and arterial\nsystem like ours at least, appropriating the terrestrial particles that come\nin its way, whether organic or inorganic, directing every single one of them\nto the formation, not exactly of flesh or skin, but of the appearance of\nthese ; doing and undoing this at will, but never keeping its material\nstructure long enough together for any body of observers to make sure that\nit is a material structure ? If a spirit could do these things, would it be by\nA modification\u2014however singular and surprising\u2014of a known power of life ?\nThe power to maintain itself is one of the known powers of life. Is the\npower to masquerade in a make-believe body one of them, or a modification\nof one of them ? Dr. Lodge would confer an infinite favour, on one of us at\nleast, if he would tell us what is known to Physical science to make such a\npower reasonably credible. Spiritualists have explained to me that the\nmaterialising spirit takes \"stuff\" from the body of the medium with which\nto construct the material envelope. This is a simpler process : it escapes\nthe feeding difficulty ; and seems only a modification of the \"known power\nof life \" which constructs snow-men or Aunt Sallies.\nNext as to trance lucidity : what renders credible to Dr. Lodge the\nhypothesis of its being caused by the agency of discarnate spirits is our\npresent knowledge \" of the material universe, of its immense scope, and the\nnumber of habitable worlds it contains.\" He finds it \" impossible to deny\nthe probability that there may be in space an immense range of life and\nintelligence of which at present we know nothing.\" There may and there\nmay not. Some form of life must be the highest, and, for anything we\n\fJUNE, 1902.] Correspondence. 255\nknow, that form may be Man. But apart from that, what would be the\nrational conclusion from the existence of other habitable worlds of similar\nchemical constituents and similar physical properties\u2014worlds vast, solid,\nand ponderous like our own ? Why, that they were the abodes of similar\nforms of life. The only legitimate reasoning in the case, if we are to remain\nsane, is from like to like, not from like to unlike. Else, why may I not\nconceive it possible that the natives of Mars may grow eight-day clocks\nin their gardens ? We know no more of \" etherial bodies,\" whether they\nare physically possible or not, than we do of such vegetable chronometers.\nIn the next place, is it legitimate to pass per saltnm from beings like\nourselves pinned down to the earth to beings on other planetary globes who\ncan at any moment set out on a Cook's tour of the universe ? Does Dr.\nLodge know anybody who can fly to Mars or the moons of Jupiter ? If not,\nwhy in the name of sober sense should he suppose anybody can come from\nthem to us ? And if they could, what could such beings have in common\nwith us 1 How much would a lark have in common with a lobster, if it took\nit into its head to visit the world of waters ?\nIf speculation of this sort is to be the order of the day, it does not require\neminence in science to excel in it. Most of us are good enough at that sort\nof thing ; but we naturally look to the trained scientific mind to keep our\nspeculation in rational courses. It is because I miss in the President's\naddress that sure-footed advance along the path of ascertained facts, which\nis the needful corrective to the lawless imaginings of the untrained faculty,\nthat I deplore the absence from it of the grounds upon which, as a front\nrank man in Physical Science, Dr. Lodge must have felt justified in sub\nmitting such speculations to a strictly experimental society.\nEDINBURGH, April, 1902. A. STEVENSON.\nMr. A. Stevenson, in his letter printed above, criticises the speculative\ntone of my address, and asks certain rhetorical questions by way of\nemphasis. I do not suppose that these questions are asked with the object\nof eliciting an answer, but it may be useful to give an explanatory note\nin connexion with them.\nIn the first place, Mr. Stevenson asks whether any animal exists which\nunderstands and can consciously and intelligently control its own vital\nprocesses. In my address I endeavoured to emphasise the fact that this kind\nof control is always subconscious\u2014a power of life, but not of intelligence ;\nand I likewise emphasised and indicated acceptance of the view familiar\nto the S.P.R. that the phenomena with which the society is chiefly concerned\nare phenomena connected with the subliminal or unconscious part of\nourselves ; or even, as I thought possible, of some subliminal or unconscious\nor secondary state of the ostensible communicators.\nSecondly, he asks whether the power to masquerade in a make-believe\nbody or part of a body is one of the powers of life. To adduce the art of\nthe actor or mimic might be considered frivolous ; and to adduce the\n\f256 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JUNE, 1902.\nphenomena which have caused some physiologists to invent the term \" ecto\nplasm,\" as the simplest way, not of explaining, but of contemplating and\nattending to certain abnormal appearances, might be considered credulous ;\nand inasmuch as my address shows that I am by no means convinced of the\npossibility of any such process as that which, if compelled by evidence, I\nexpressed myself as willing to contemplate from that point of view, I shall\nrefrain from entering upon the discussion as if I had definitely advocated\nsome particular theory.\nThirdly, Mr. Stevenson asks whether I know anybody who can fly to\nMars or to the moons of Jupiter, or in fact take a Cook's tour of the\nUniverse. He is evidently under the misapprehension that \" the immense\nrange of life and intelligence in the Universe, of which at present,\" as I said,\n\" we know nothing,\" was all conceived by me to be limited to the surface of\nplanetary bodies. My conception, however, was different from this. From\nthe fact that we find life luxuriating everywhere, and often in the most\nunexpected places, on the earth,\u2014which life comes we know not whence,\u2014I\nfind it unnecessary dogmatically to limit the possibility of some variety of\nlife and intelligence to those conditions and circumstances which we have\nalready explored and grown familiar with.\nIf I used the phrase discarnate spirits it was with no thought of Mars or\nof any other planet in my mind.\nOn the contrary, any difficulty which I felt and expressed about the\nimprobability of direct telepathic connexion with unknown persons in India\nor New Zealand, as an explanation of clairvoyance or lucidity, would apply\nwith redoubled force to telepathic communication from hopelessly unknown\nindividuals in other planets. Since Mr. Stevenson thus misconceived my\nmeaning, other persons may have done the same, and I am glad of the oppor\ntunity of removing at any rate this misapprehension.\nOLIVER LODGE.\nPRIVATE MEETING FOR MEMBERS AND ASSOCIATES.\nIt has been for some time the intention of the Council to start a\nseries of private meetings, for Members and Associates only, as soon as\npossible after entering into possession of the Society's new rooms.\nWe are now able to announce that the first of this series of meetings\nwill be held at 4 P.M. on Friday, June 20th, in the Small Hall, at\n20 Hanover Square, London, W., when a paper by Miss M.

F. PODMORE in the chair.\nTHE CHAIRMAN explained that it was, unfortunately, impossible for\nthe author of the paper announced to read it himself. He went on to\nsay that the paper was a new departure on the part of the Society,\nwhich had hitherto mainly investigated civilized peoples. He thought\nthe Society was to be congratulated on this new line of inquiry.\nMR. N. W. THOMAS read a paper by MR. W. W. SKEAT entitled\n\" Malay Spiritualism,\" of which, as it will appear in full in the Proceed\nings, only a brief rfaumA is here given. After describing various super\nnormal powers claimed by Malay magicians, the paper detailed four\nclasses of ceremonies, the first two of which might be regarded as\nmotor automatisms; the third consisted of so-called \"sendings,\" or, as\nthe Malays call them, \"pointings\": and the fourth were rites intended\nto produce \" possession.\"\nIn the first class of ceremonies Mr. Skeat described in complete\n.detail the dancing Palm-blossom and the dancing Fish-trap, and then\nproceeded to point out that the object of ceremonies of this class did\nnot lie on the surface; whereas the ceremonies of the second class,\nincluding the divining lemon, the divining rod, and similar rites, had\nan object which was apparent even to the untrained observer.\nUnder the third head Mr. Skeat described the Malay beliefs with\nregard to the Polong and other familiar spirits.\nIn the fourth class he described how a magician, during his period of\n\" possession,\" by rotating his head rapidly and at the same time\nshaking his entire body (especially the shoulders and thighs), produced\na strikingly realistic imitation of an epileptic fit. The paper then went\non to discuss interpretations, more especially of the ceremonies of the\nfirst class, and argued that we have here to do with rites of productive,\nor, as it may be termed, economic, magic,\u2014the object of which is to\nincrease the supply of food.\nTHE CHAIRMAN remarked that among the beliefs described by Mr.\nSkeat we found many parallels to modern European beliefs, and\nespecially to spiritualistic beliefs and practices. It was a remarkable\nthing that the cup and ring ceremony described by Mr. Skeat was\nexactly paralleled in the early days of spiritualism by a practice in\nwhich a ring held in the same way struck the hour against the side of\n\f260 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JULY, 1902.\na bowl. He had also heard from spiftt mediums of a body closely\nresembling the Polong. Mr. Podmore then invited questions.\nMR. CANDLER asked what was meant by a vampire, whether any\nfurther details could be given about the vampire heads bought by Mr.\nSkeat, and what was their subsequent history.\nMR. THOMAS briefly explained what was meant by a vampire, and\nstated that so far as he knew the skulls did not manifest any super\nnormal powers.\nMR. Fox PITT inquired whether Mr. Thomas thought that the\nMalays thoroughly believed in all these superstitions. Mr. Thomas\nsaid he thought they certainly did, and he gave details of a Welsh\nbelief in an object resembling the Polong, remarking that the belief of\nthe village where the object was said to be found was most unquestion\nable.\nTHE HON. EVERARD FEILDING said he had visited the Malay penin\nsula, and had there met Mr. Skeat. He was quite certain that the\nbelief of the Malays in their superstitions was sufficient to induce them\nto put themselves to considerable inconvenience, and in a case which\ncame under his own observation a Malay fasted for several days at a\nplace supposed to be inhabited by the spirit of a snake, with the idea of\ngaining invulnerability and superhuman strength, and was found in a\nvery exhausted condition. He went on to give an illustration of the\nMalay beliefs as to the causes of disease. Mr. Skeat had personal\nknowledge of a case in which a man, who was suffering from violent\nheadache and other symptoms and was believed to be dying, had been\ncured by a pretence to extract from his head seven large \"praying''\nmantises. The performance was regarded by the natives as in no way\nextraordinary, and the patient, who was certainly very nearly dying of\nstarvation (through refusing to eat on account of his hallucinations), at\nonce began to get better and recovered.\nEXPERIMENTS IN THOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE.\nOur readers may remember a case of collective crystal vision, appar\nently involving thought-transference, printed in the Journal for Novem\nber, 1901, p. 134. One of the percipients, Miss Grieve, who contributed\nthe account, tried further experiments, but could then only continue\nthem for a short time, and has not, so far, been able to resume them.\nWe therefore print her account without further delay, in the hope\nthat it may encourage some of our own members to similar efforts.\nIt includes, as will be seen, a spontaneous veridical vision of the results\n\fJULY, 1902.] Experiments in Thought-Transference. 261\n.of an examination held at the Leasowes, Halesowen, a physical training\nCollege for women, at which Miss Grieve is a student. She writes :\u2014\nTHE LEASOWES, HALESOWEN, WORCESTERSHIRE, Dec. 15th, 1901.\nYou ask me about the experiments in thought-transference. I have done\nvery little\u2014and only began on Nov. 15th. Miss Hitchfield [a mistress at the\nCollege] said she would send me a thought from 10 to 10.10 p.m. that night.\nSo I sat alone in my study and she lay in her bed and thought. I kept my\nmind a blank, as far as possible, merely noting the thoughts as they\npassed through, and not encouraging any particularly. After, perhaps,\nabout 5 minutes a lovely blue light seemed to fill the room, clearing to\nsilver whiteness, and a certain lady whom we both knew appeared, saying,\n\" God is spirit, not a spirit,\" and that those who are drowned have lived their\ntime and are not just snatched away. The thought really was\u2014beautiful\nclear moonlight, a lake, and all the deep black shadows round it\u2014so\nit was not very successful.\nNext night I thought to Miss Hitchfield\u2014both in our beds at opposite\nends of the house. I thought of my father shooting with dogs in the\nwoods at home, and Miss Hitchfield got it perfectly. Then, Nov. 28th,\nMiss Goad and I went to Miss Hitchfield's study about 6 p.m. and\nMiss H. thought first for 10 minutes. After about 7 minutes I saw\na bridge over a canal like Venice, and yet no part of Venice that I\nknew, and up on the right a huge castle. Miss Goad got nothing. The\nthought was : Miss H. herself on a bridge in Stockholm looking up\nat the castle on the right, and behind a lovely sunset. Next I thought\nof tobogganning at home when my sister had an accident. Miss H.\ngot the scenery exactly, first the house, then the long steeply sloping\nlawn, then the carriage drive, white paling and burn at the bottom of\nanother slope\u2014but she did not get the sledges. Lastly, Miss Goad\nthought, and in half a minute I had the whole scene correctly. A\nsingularly steep cliff, with a narrow path leading to and going half-way\ndown it. Below a rough sea and Miss Goad bathing in it with a dark\ncollie dog. That was her thought exactly, though she said she tried\nto keep her dog out of it. Miss H. did not get it.\nThen lastly on Dec. 1st. On Nov. 26th we had an Anatomy examination.\nThe papers were corrected and the results known to Miss Hitchfield (who had\ncorrected them) alone on Dec. 1st. They were to be put up next day at 12.\nThat night (Dec. 1st) lying in bed, thinking of nothing very particular, I\nsuddenly seemed to see a sheet of paper and, in Miss H.'s writing, the list of\nnames, marks, and places. I did not bother to get up and write them down\nthen, but did so at 6 a.m. first thing when I got [down] on Dec. 2nd,\ngetting Miss Goad to sign it. There were 3 names at the top with\nmaximum marks\u201450\u2014and you can imagine the excitement all the morning\nwhen I told them, and they had to wait to prove it till the list was\npinned up at mid-day. It was quite right in every detail. Miss H. said\njshe was not conscious of thinking of the results at the time I saw\n\f262 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

GRIEVE.\nWe asked Miss Grieve to let us see the original notes of her experi\nments and an exact copy of the actual examination list ; and also for a\ncorroboratory statement from Miss Hitchfield. In reply Miss Grieve\nkindly sent us a book of rough pencil notes, signed by Miss Hitchfield,\ntogether with a letter stating the latter's willingness to sign the notes\nand to have her name mentioned in confirmation of the experiments.\nThe notes were as follows :\n1. Blue light. Mrs. W. explaining that God is spirit, not a spirit.\nAlso that those who are drowned have lived out their time\u2014are ready for\nthe next state and not snapped off, as is commonly supposed. Nov. 15th,\n1901.\nMiss Hitchfield thought of the lake in moonlight, with deep shadows\nand white lights and boat on it. (And the Creator of all.\u2014E. H.)\n2.

I saw, after about 7 minutes of blankness\u2014a bridge\nover a canal, like Venice, and yet not Venice that I knew, and a castle\nup on the right hand side. The thought was : Miss H. stood on a bridge\nover a canal in Stockholm and watched the sunset and the castle on her\nright hand side.\n(6) I thought of tobogganning at home on our lawn when Kitty ran into a\nyew bush and cut her temple. Miss H. saw a large house, very, very\nwhite, with a sloping lawn, a road at the bottom and a fence, a steep bank\nand then a burn. Quite correct, but she did not get the toboggan.\n(c) Miss Goad thought, and Miss H. saw a church-yard and Miss Coad\ncoming up a narrow lane with a dog. I saw a huge high cliff with a narrow\npath winding down to it, and half way down the cliff. Below, the sea and\nMiss Coad bathing with her dog\u2014a big dark collie.\nShe thought of the winding path, as above, and did just think of bath\ning there with the dog, but tried to put that out of her mind, and really\nconcentrated on the scenery.\nDec. 1st.

Dream.\nThe following letter was addressed to Mr. Piddington. We are\nasked not to print the writer's name and address :\nDear Sir, Oct. 6th, 1901.\nOn reading your letter to the Spectator of Oct. 5th, I thought you\nmight possibly be interested in a coincidence which took place at the\nend of August last. I am attached to a certain young lady. At the time\nI refer to I was staying near Peterboro' and the lady in question was\nat her home, a seaside town in Yorkshire. One very close and thundery\nnight I found some difficulty in getting to sleep. When finally I fell\nasleep, or rather dozed, the face of Miss D. rose up before me, and to my\nsurprise one side of her face was very much swollen and she looked very\nunhappy. I sat up in bed and spoke to her, only to find that I had been\ndreaming. Again I fell asleep and dreamt that I was walking along a street,\n\f264 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JULY, 1902.\nwhen I heard a cry above me, and looking up saw Miss D.'s face at a window\nfrom which smoke and flames were issuing. I rushed upstairs, only to see\nher face floating in the smoke, very much swollen. I tried to grasp her, and\nwoke up with a cry. Somehow the dream depressed me, and next day in\nwriting to Miss D. I told her the whole thing, much as I have told you.\nImagine my surprise a day after, when I heard from her that on the night\nin question she had gone out to see a house on fire\u2014Mrs. K.'s seaside\nresidence ; had contracted a chill, and gone to bed with her face enormously\nswollen up, and had suffered severe toothache all night. Our letters on the\nsubject will confirm dates, etc. . . . H. B.\nMr. H. B. is an undergraduate of College, Cambridge. He\nwas asked to call on Mrs. Verrall and give her further particulars, and\nhe did so on October 16th, 1901. Mrs. Verrall reported as follows:\n5 SELWYN GARDENS, CAMBRIDGE, Oct. 16th, 1901.\nI have just seen Mr. H. B., and have no doubt at all that the case is genuine.\nAt the same time the evidence is not quite so complete as I had hoped from\nhis letter, but these are the facts as given me by him : On a certain Sunday\nin August (subsequently ascertained to be the 25th) H. B. dreamt, as he told\nMr. Piddington, that he saw M iss D. with a swollen face, and later on the\nsame night, that he saw her at a window from which smoke and fire were\ncoming. On Monday he wrote to Miss D. to ask if she had had a toothache,\nbut on second thoughts decided that it would make him feel foolish if nothing\nhad occurred, and so tore up the letter. On a later day in the week he was\nwriting to her about other things, and then mentioned his vivid dream about\nthe swollen face (this part of the business evidently impressed him much\nmore than the fire). But before he sent this letter he received one from her\nmentioning that she had been suffering from a severe toothache and swollen\nface since Sunday night. This letter I have seen ; it is dated from Filey,\non \" Wednesday \" (obviously August 28th), and begins by saying that she is\nsorry not to have written before, but has been \" seedy ever since Sunday.\nI think I must have got a chill ; anyhow, I had raging toothache from\nSunday night till \" the day before, when she had the tooth out with gas.\nThe letter went on to give a graphic description, with a sketch, of her\nappearance during the time that her face was swollen.\nOn the receipt of this letter, H. B. was so much astonished to find that his\ndream about the swollen face was true that he added a postscript to his\nletter (which had not yet gone) to say that he had seen her with a swollen\nface at a window from which smoke was coming, and to ask if that part of\nthe dream was also true.\nHer letter in answer to that I have also seen. It is dated from Filey on\nAugust 31st, 1901, and I copy the important part:\u2014\"I was awfully\ninterested in your dream ; it is the queerest thing I have heard of for ages.\nThe funny part of it is that I got the cold which made my toothache so bad\nby going out on Sunday evening, hearing that there was a fire on the\n\fJULY, 1902.] Oases. 265\nOrescent. It was Mrs. K.'s house ; one of the bedrooms got ou fire. It was\nnothing much, and was put out before the Fire Brigade arrived. . . . Auntie\nM. first noticed smoke coming out of the window.\" The writer goes on to\nsay (and this seems to me very interesting) \" M. gave me a sleeping powder\non Sunday night, so I slept heavily, in spite of the pain.\" She also says that\nshe thought about him a good deal on Monday night when she had seen\n.what a sight she was, but not on Sunday.\nOf course it is unfortunate, evidentially, that nothing was posted from\nhim to her till after her letter mentioning the swollen face. At the same\ntime I think the two letters of hers which I have seen establish the truth of\nhis statement that he mentioned the fire to her before hearing of it from her.\nHis whole account of the matter impressed me as frank and accurate; he\nshowed me the whole of the letters, which were in their envelopes, so that\nthe postmarks confirmed the contents of the letters as to dates.\nHe does not think that the lady will have kept his letters, nor that it\n.would be of any use to write to her for corroboration.\nHe tells me that he has never had any similar experience before ; he\n.dreams constantly, but he dwelt emphatically on the very vivid nature\nof the earlier part of this dream. The impression was so strong that he sat\nup and spoke to the lady before he realised that he was dreaming. He\nhas several times guessed the thoughts, after an interval of silence, both of\nthis 'lady and of one of his three sisters ; he has had no success with his\n.other sisters, nor has he ever had any impression unless he and the sister\n.(or Miss D.) were in the same room. Since this episode he dreamt that\nMiss D. was angry with him, and encouraged by the August experience, he\nwrote to her to ask if it were true. She replied that it was not, but that\non the same night she had dreamt that he was angry with her.\nM. DE G. VBKRALL.\nG. 269. Apparition.\nThe following account of a \" haunted house \" in a London suburb\n.was sent to Mr. Podmore. We are requested not to print the names\nof the witnesses or the address of the house, which is used as a boys'\nschool. Miss W., the daughter of the headmaster, writes :\u2014\nFebruary 21st, 1902.\nIt was in July, 1894, that I saw the figure. I was then about 14. I was\ngetting ready for school at nine o'clock in the morning, and was about to walk\nthrough the box-room when I saw, as I thought, my brother coming through it\ntowards me. He had remained in bed that morning, not being well, and I\nthought he must have dressed and be coming down after all. I spoke to him\nwhen I was still several yards from him, asking what was the matter, as I\nthought he looked very miserable, and as if he had been crying. Without\nanswering, the figure turned off through a door leading to a bedroom. I\nfollowed, still thinking it was my brother, and saw no one in the room. There\n\f266 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JULY, 1902.\nis another door in this room by which my brother could have got back to his-\nroom, so I went there and found him still in bed. He told me he had not left\nhis room. I had not then been told anything about the house being haunted.\nWhen I went downstairs I told my parents what I had seen. I have never\nsince seen anything of the kind in the house. The figure looked about my\nbrother's height, and he was then about 13. It had dark clothes and hair,\nand looked very pale. As far as I remember, it wore knickerbockers.\nIn March, 1901, my grandfather being very ill, I was at his house one\nevening, and was standing talking to an aunt in a sitting room below his\nbedroom. My aunt had her eyes fixed on some work she was doing. I\nsuddenly thought I saw some one standing near me, and, half turning round,\nthought my grandfather was standing looking at me. A second after I saw\nthere was nothing there, but it startled me, as I saw my grandfather so\nplainly, fully dressed, and I even noticed a gold watch chain which he always\nwore. I said nothing to my aunt, as I knew she would be nervous. A short\ntime after, my grandfather died. N. W.\nMr. Podmore writes :\nMarch 7th, 1902.\n[The house] is an old 17th century house ; had been a school years ago,\nbefore took it. Legend about boy being confined in a dark cupboard\nand starved, but no authentic details. Vague stories of previous haunt, but\nno confirmation to be obtained. I heard Miss N. W. describe her experience\nand saw the place,\u2014a kind of inner lobby leading off an angle of the stairs,\nhalf passage and half box-room,\u2014where the figure appeared to walk across.\nThe following account is from one of Mr. W.'s servants :\u2014\nOne afternoon in March, 1898, I went upstairs about six o'clock. On\nopening the door of one of the bedrooms I saw, as I thought, a boy standing\nby the bed, in light clothing. Thinking it was the boy who slept in that\nroom, changing his clothes, I drew back and closed the door. Hearing\nnothing, however, I looked in again, and thought I saw a figure pass from\nthe bedside to the cupboard door in the room. On going into the room to-\nmake certain, I found the cupboard door shut and fastened and no one in,\nthe room. I had heard the story about the house being haunted, but,\nthough a little startled, did not till afterwards connect it with what I had\nseen. I have never since seen anything of the kind. M. A.\nMiss L., a dressmaker, who worked in the house, once saw the figure\nof a boy there. She gave Mr. Podmore verbally an account of her\nexperience, which he wrote down and she afterwards signed, as follows :\nJanuary 13th, 1902.\nIt was one day in August last (1901), after tea, about 5.30 p.m., a very\nbright, sunny day, I had just reached the angle of the back stairs between\nthe first and second floors when I saw a figure dart out from the passage to\n\fJULY, 1902.] Cases. 267\nmy left hand and leap across the stairs, just in front of me, and run up to\nthe top of the flight. The figure seemed to be that of a fairly tall boy, of\nabout 14, in gray trousers, black jacket, black shoes. His hair was dark.\nHe seemed to turn away his face from me, so that I could not see it. I\nfollowed the figure immediately\u2014he was only a few feet in front of me\u2014but\nit had vanished. I searched the upper part of the house, but could find\nno one.\nSome people had told me, a few years before, that the house was supposed\nto be haunted ; and I said then that it was most likely rats. I had never\nheard that the ghost of a boy was supposed to be seen in the house.\nI have never at any other time seen a ghostly figure, or anything of the\nkind.\n(Signed in full) M. L .\nMr. Podmore adds :\nMiss L told Mr. W the next day what she had seen. She men\ntioned, Mr. W tells me, the gray trousers at the time ; but Mr. W\ndoes not remember to have heard previously the other details of the dress.\nThere were no boys in the house at the time, the school being closed for the\nholidays.\nI visited the scene with Miss L , and she showed me where she stood\nand where the figure rushed across\u2014not more than 5 or 6 feet in front of her\napparently. There is a small window in the angle of the stairs, and another\nlarge window at the foot of the stairs ; so that on an August afternoon the\nplace would be well lighted. Miss L , who is absolutely deaf, gave me\nthe account viva voce, and then signed my written notes.\nPRIVATE MEETING FOR MEMBERS AND ASSOCIATES.\nTHE first of the series of private meetings for Members and\nAssociates only was held in the Small Hall, at 20 Hanover Square,\nLondon, W., on Friday, June 20th, at 4 P.M.\u2014the Hon. E. Feilding in\nthe chair.\nTHE CHAIRMAN made a few remarks with regard to the scheme of\nthe new meetings thus inaugurated. He observed that the large\ngeneral meetings were useful in bringing a large number of persons\ninto touch with the work of the Society, but the bulk of the audience\nin them was composed of non-subscribers, and the Council had for\nsome time felt it undesirable that so many of the benefits of the\nSociety should be offered in this way, without any support being given\nto the Society's funds. It was also felt that at the large meetings\na good deal of interesting discussion was probably lost through the\nnatural shyness of many in the audience, whereas at smaller private\n\f.268 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JULY, 1902.\nmeetings interesting discussions might be held and interesting facts\nlearnt from members who would be loth to speak in public.\nThese meetings would also give opportunities for papers to be\nbrought forward which\u2014,either from their containing few new facts or\nfor some other reason\u2014were not thought suitable for publication in\n.our already somewhat overcrowded Proceedings, but which afforded\ninteresting and instructive matter for discussion. The meetings would\nalso give members an opportunity of hearing about what work was\ngoing on in the Society and of becoming acquainted with those who\nwere practically responsible for carrying on the work, and with one\nanother.\nThe Chairman went on to say that he had much pleasure in\nannouncing that the Society had just received the generous gift of\n\u00a3750 from a donor who wished to remain anonymous.\nMiss M. BRAMSTON then read a paper on \" Automatic Romance,\" of\n.which the following is a resume :\nWhen the conscious self is passive, and the unconscious self active,\nthe activity of the unconscious self almost invariably takes the form\nof some kind of automatic romance. In this automatic romance is\nfrequently conveyed to us some kind of information not accessible\nto our ordinary mind, and attention is often confined to the informa\ntion conveyed, to the neglect of the study of the automatic romance.\nTaking a metaphor from Browning's Abt Vogler, we may call the\nautomatic romance the \"illumination lights\" of the edifice we raise,\nand the supernormally conveyed information the \"meteor-moons,\"\nwhich descend from some unknown source to crown our work. The\npoint of this paper is to call special attention to automatic romance.\nAutomatic romance can be traced elsewhere than in our special\nregion of psychical research. It plays a great part in the writing of\nfiction,\u2014not with all writers, but with many. You invent your puppets\nand give them the rails on which they are to run, and then the\nautomatic romancer within you takes them in hand, chooses their names,\ninvents undesigned coincidences, and arranges your story so that it\nfrequently seems as if some one were telling the story to you. In\nautomatic writing proper, the subconscious romancer chooses the\npuppets (which invariably include the writer as the most prominent\nfigure). In the course of writing it is possible that a new figure,\npurporting to be that of some one absent or dead, may come upon the\nscene. In this case you may get a \" meteor-moon \" of verifiable\ninformation before unknown to you, and thenceforward the person so\npresented to your consciousness may take his place among the other\n\fJULY, 1902.] Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 269'\npuppets of the automatic romance. In this case the writer is inclined\nto think that, though once a \"meteor-moon,\" he goes on as an\n\"illumination light\"; but he has often been considered a \"meteor-\nmoon \"\u2014a discarnate spirit visitor\u2014throughout. This seems to be\nthe case with several instances of spirit communication, and would\naccount for the curious lapses of intelligence in some of the communi\ncators, as when Professor Hyslop's father could not remember his\nwife's name.\nFour automatic romances were then compared,\u2014the first that of the\nwriter of the paper, which had for its personages the writer, and a\ndeceased boy-friend as guide and instructor. In this the writer\nreluctantly came to the conclusion that there was no reason to believe\nthat the soi-disant person was in reality present. The second was that\nof Stainton Moses, in which \" Imperator\" and \"Rector\" took the place\nof Stainton Moses' guides and instructors. The third was that of Mdlle.\nSmith, of Geneva, and her guide, \" Leopold.\" The fourth was that of\nMrs. Piper, instructed first by \"Phinuit\" and then by \"George\nPelham,\" and subsequently by an \"Imperator\"and a \"Rector,\" supposed\nto be the same as the guides of whom she had read in Stainton Moses'\nSpirit Teachings, but who, the writer argued from their characteristics,\nwere entirely distinct personalities,\u2014the original \" Imperator \" and\n\"Rector\" being the product of Stainton Moses' automatic romance, the\nlater ones of that of Mrs. Piper.\nThe writer then went on to suggest that even where a deceased\nperson seemed to be present, we should remember that the medium\nseems to have the power of reading not only the facts connected with\nhim from the mind of the sitters, but also their imaginations, and that\nthe faculty of \"trace,\" apparently possessed by many mediums, might\nenable them to discern the past history of a material object brought in\ncontact with them without the presence of the discarnate spirit to whom\nit had belonged in life. The conclusion left on the mind of the writer\nwas practically that expressed in Dr. Van Eeden's paper in the last\nnumber of Proceedings.\nAt the conclusion of the paper tea was served, after which there was\na discussion.\nMR. A. F. SHAND said he thought it very desirable that attempts\nshould be made to bring the results of psychical research and of psy\nchology into line with one another. The psychologist, while of\ncourse familiar with subconscious impressions of many kinds, did\nnot as a rule admit the existence of anything like a coherent and\nintelligent subconscious or subliminal personality, except in rare\n\f270 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JULY, 1902.\nabnormal cases. It was important to test the hypothesis that such\na personality existed normally in all of us.\nMR. FEILDING recounted a case of the reproduction through auto\nmatic writing of sensory impressions too faint to be consciously\nperceived, which he thought had some bearing on Mr. Shand's\nquestion. Whilst travelling in America in a private car with a\nparty, amongst whom was a young lady who could write automatically\nwith a planchette, he asked this lady to go into one end of the car,\nwhich was divided off as a smoking-room, opening by a glass door into\nthe corridor. She was here surrounded by the rest of the party, who\nwere asked to talk and make as much noise as they possibly could, and\nnot to pay any attention to Mr. Feilding. He then went to the other\nend of the car and read aloud a passage out of a book in an ordinary\ntone of voice. When he had finished he went to the young lady and\nasked her to reproduce in automatic writing what he had read. She\ndid not reproduce the whole accurately, but she wrote a good many\nwords which were in the passage, and which were very uncommon,\nshowing clearly that though she was not conscious of having heard\nanything he had said, many of the sounds had reached her subliminal\nconsciousness.\nMR. SWEENEY said that he thought it extremely important that the\nSociety should make experiments to show that subconsciousness existed\nand was active in automatic writing.\nMR. STEPHENSON suggested that fiction writers might be interviewed\non the question of how far their writing was done automatically or\nsemi-automatically. He thought that many authors probably wrote\nmuch from sub-conscious memory.\nCOLONEL TAYLOR observed that the different evidence we had\nshowed that no two people are in the same state when they receive\nvarious impressions of phenomena, and that it was impossible to\nlay down rules as to what is normal and what abnormal. He did not\nthink any impression which our senses received could be called\nabnormal.\nThe discussion, which was lengthy and animated, was continued by\nMiss Bramston, Mrs. Home, Mr. Adolphe Smith, Mr. H. R. Hogg,\nMr. Fox Pitt, and others.\n\fJULY, 1902.] Annual Subscriptions and Donations. 271\nSPECIAL ANNUAL SUBSCRIPTIONS AND DONATIONS\nTOWARDS THE FUNDS OF THE SOCIETY.\n{deceived in 1901.)

PIPER.\nTo the Editor of the\nJOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nMay 18th, 1902.\nThe reference of your correspondent, Mr. Murray, to the paper by Mrs.\nSidgwick (Proceedings, Part XXXVI.) reminds one that a non-acceptance of\nDr. Hodgson's theory of spirit possession does not involve necessarily the\nabandonment of all idea of transcendental knowledge. There is an alterna\ntive hypothesis\u2014the one put forward by Mrs. Sidgwick in the paper referred\nto\u2014a hypothesis which, whatever we may think of the evidence in its\nfavour, is at all events not vulnerable by the profane shaft of Mr. Murray.\nIt is, briefly, if I understand it aright : Telepathy from the sitter, and\nindirectly, through his subliminal consciousness, from other persons, mostly\nfriends of his, both living and dead, exploited for the purposes of dramatic\npersonation by the secondary personality of the medium.\nWhat has become of this hypothesis ? Professor Hyslop apparently\nignores it altogether.\nIf there is one thing that is manifest from the Piper case, it is surely that\nresults are dependent largely upon the sitter, though not necessarily upon\nhis conscious thoughts. Some sitters, with the best intentions, get na\nresults, or very poor ones ; others are more or less uniformly successful.\n\" G.P.,\" as Mr. Andrew Lang says, \"was strongest with his most intimate\nfriends.\" Can any oue read through Professor Hyslop's report and not be\nstruck by the remarkable falling off in success at those sittings where he\nhimself was not present in person, but was represented by Dr. Hodgson, to-\nwhom the Professor's deceased relatives were strangers ? As Mr. Lang says,\ntelepathy a trois is \" a great deal to grant,\" but then Mrs. Piper herself is a\ngreat deal, and we cannot get away from Mrs. Piper.\nTelepathy from the dead, fortunately, does not rest exclusively upon the\nPiper case. There is always Frederic Myers and his residuum of messages\nconveying facts known only to deceased persons (Proceedings, Vol. VI.r\np. 314). Even Mr. Lang, who finds no such messages in Dr. Hodgson's\nreports of Mrs. Piper, was not unimpressed, apparently, by Mr. Myers\n(Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 609).\nThat the protest of Mr. Murray is justified more or less as against Professor\nHyslop can hardly be doubtful, if one may say so. In psychical research\nsurely, as elsewhere, a full consideration of the internal character of a\nrevelation cannot be excluded from any adequate estimate of its evidences.\nFor the plain man, probably, the effect of the learned Professor's 300 pages\nof close reasoning will always be dissipated by five minutes' indiscreet\ngarrulousness on the part of \" Imperator \" and his friends.\nB.

Dream.\nMr. Petrovo-Solovovo sends us the following case in which authentic\ninformation, presumably unknown to the dreamer and purporting to\ncome from his deceased brother, was given in a dream.\nThe first account of the case appeared in a Russian newspaper, the\ntranslation of which; furnished by Mr. Solovovo, and enclosed in a\nletter from him dated' December 1st [14th], 1901, is as follows :\nExtract from the Peterburgskaia Gazeta of Nov. 12th [25th], 1901.\nAn Errand from the Other World.\u2014The apparitions of the dead, clairvoy\nance, enigmatic prophetic dreams, and other facts from the mysterious\nregion of so-called mediumistic phenomena, have always excited general\ninterest, and will always form the subject of animated discussion and\ngossip ; and there always are and will be sceptics who do not believe in such\ncases, and wish to give them this or that \" simple \" explanation. This\nunbelief is especially supported by the circumstance that the cases narrated\n\fOCT., 1902.] Case. 275\ngenerally take place somewhere far away in another town, with some\nunknown \"x's\" and \"y's.\"\nThe case we shall relate took place here in Petersburg, and has just\noccurred in the night of November 4th-5th. But let us begin in due order.\nIn the summer of the current year Mr. Sharoeff, an engineer and technical\neditor of the journal, The Electrician, ordered Alexander Semenoff, a\npeasant of the province of Tver, district of Novotorjok, and servant\n[artehchik] at the journal's office, to get the volumes of the \" Proceedings\"\nof the First Congress of Electricians, which took place, as is known, in\nDecember, 1899, and gave him a receipt for 10 roubles, No. 153, signed by the\nTreasurer of the Congress. From [the appearance of] this receipt it was\nimpossible to understand, without an external explanation, that it entitled\none to receive the books in question,1 for it was a mere receipt for the\npayment of a \"member's subscription\" for taking part in the meetings of\nthe late First Congress of Electricians, and contained no indication whatever\nof the address at which the \" Proceedings \" were edited ; [besides, they began\nto be edited] when the Congress was already over.\nThe servant forgot to fulfil the errand, and M. Sharoeff forgot to remind\nhim of it, as there was no more need of the books.\nOn September 30th [October 13th] of this year the servant, Alexander\nSemenoff, left on leave of absence for the country and died there, unex\npectedly, on October 3rd [16th], his place being taken by his brother Ilya,\nwhom the late artelschik, in consequence of his unexpected death, naturally\ncould not hnve initiated in the affairs of the office\u2014still less could have told\nanything about the unfulfilled errand.\nIt must be observed that the late artelschik had been taken, as they say,\n\" from the plough,\" taught, and set on foot by the chief editor of the\njournal, received 30 roubles wages [about 3 pounds] a month, and in conse\nquence prized much his situation, and was punctual and careful in the affairs\nof the office.2\nOn the evening of November 4th [17th] the new servant came back home\nand went to bed ; after 11 o'clock he was already in bed and began to doze.\nHe distinctly heard how the clock struck twelve. Some more time passed,\nand then he suddenly sees his late brother, quite as if alive, approaching\nhim, as always neatly dressed, in a black morning coat.\nHaving appeared, the deceased spoke to his brother as follows :\n\" Ilyusha, I have come to tell you that, before dying, I forgot to fulfil one\nof master's errands. Go and search in my chest of drawers, among the\npapers, for a receipt, No. 153, in M. Sharoeff's name, from the Congress of\nElectricians. Go with this receipt to house No. 134, Catherine Canal. The\noffices of the journal Electricity are there. Show this receipt, and they will\ngive you the volume of the ' Proceedings of the Congress.' When you have\ngot them, bring them to master at once. By all means fulfil my errand,\nbecause I am much disturbed about my having forgotten to fulfil it then.\n1 With regard to this, see further on.\u2014M. P.-S.\n2 This was specially stated to me by M. Doviakovsky.\u2014M. P.-S.\n\f276 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [OCT., 1902.\nBe sure to search well, Ilyusha, perhaps master wants those books. This\ntortures me much.\" L\nAfter these words the apparition vanished. The new servant slept badly\nthe rest of the night, and, having awakened in the morning, began to search\nfor the receipt at once. There being in the chest of drawers of his late\nbrother many papers of all kinds\u2014bills, receipts, letters\u2014he could not find\nat once what he wanted : but the idea of the necessity of fulfilling his late\nbrother's errand pursued him unceasingly, and at last, after three days, when\nperusing a parcel of small papers, he found the receipt he wanted, No. 153.\nGladdened by this finding, the artelschik at once ran to the address given\nby his late brother, did actually receive, to his greatest amazement, the\nabove-mentioned \"Proceedings of the Congress of Electricians,\" and brought\nthem to M. Sharoeff, who had long since forgotten to think about these\nbooks. . . . SOME ONE.\nMr. Petrovo-Solovovo writes :\nI saw the artelschik, Ilya Semenoff, for the first time on Nov. 16\/29, and\nhe impressed me very favourably. In conversation with me he confirmed\nthe fact of his late brother having appeared to him in a dream and\n\" [looking] as always,\" i.e. \" as alive.\" He did not believe in dreams before.\nI also understood him\u2014as I see on looking at the short account of our\nmeeting I wrote on the same day, but not in I. S.'s presence\u2014to say that his\nbrother did in fact give him the No. of the receipt, and that, on awakening\nafter his dream, he spoke about it at first to M. Doviakovsky, the chief\neditor of the Electrician, and then to M. Sharoeff.\nOn the evening of Nov. 19th [December 2nd] I called again at the offices of\nthe same paper, when I made the acquaintance of both M. Doviakovsky and\nM. Sharoeff. The following is the translation of an account of our meeting,\nembodying the notes written on the spot. I wrote immediately after returning\nhome.\nNote on interview with M. Sharoeff and Ilya Semenoff in the offices of\nthe journal, The Electrician, on Nov. 19, 1901.\nFrom questions I put to Ilya Semenoff it became clear thnt :\nI. S. did not see the dream on November 4th [17th], but about Nov. 1st\n[14th] or in the middle of October.\nThe No. {of the receipt) was not given (in the dream).\nThe \" Proceedings \" (of the Congress) were called \" diaries.\"\nThe address of thejournal, \" Electricity,\" was unknown (to him), was given in\nthe dream, and (he was told) to ask Colonel Smiznoff (the editor).\nI. S. began to search (for the receipt) after a few days, (and) did not find\nit at once.\nHe signed at my wish the following statement :\n\" I certify that the narrative, with the corrections, is true.\"\nILYA SEMENOFF.\nlrThe last sentences, beginning with \"By all means fulfil,\" etc., are distinctly\napocryphal, as stated to me by Ilya Semenoff.\u2014M. P.-S.\n\fOCT., 1902.] Case. 277\nM. Sharoeff signed the following statement of his opinion on the same\nsubject :\n\"[M. Sharoeff] is somewhat astonished that nothing was said to him\nimmediately after the dream, in spite of the fact that I. S. saw him several\ntimes in the office : 1 he confirms this fact in its main details ; he believes in\nhis (I. S.'s) honesty, having no reason not to believe [him]. On the eve of\nthe day when he got the ' Proceedings ' [M. Sharoeff] saw in a dream the\nartelschik, A(lexander) S(emenoff), who, having presented himself before\nhim, handed him a parcel with proofs of the paper, The Electrician, and\napologised for being late in bringing them. After coming into the office\n[M. Sharoeff] received the ' Proceedings ' of the Congress.\n\"[M. Sharoeff] sees a certain possibility of a natural explanation in the\ncircumstance that A(lexander) S(emenoff) had fallen ill in St. Petersburg,\nand had had time during three or four days to initiate his brother in the\naffairs of the office. (Signed) \" SHAROEFF.\"\n[M. Doviakovsky: the chief editor] heard about this case at the same\ntime. (. , . He seemed profoundly impressed by the case in question ; he\nwas present as well as several other gentlemen during my conversation with\nM. Sharoeff and Ilya Semenoff. Apparently it was his account of the case\nwhich got into the Peterburgskaia Gazeta in a somewhat exaggerated form.) 2\n[M.] Doviakovsky and [M.] Sharoeff deny absolutely that Ilya Semenoff\ncould have known (the address of the offices of Electricity) before the illness\nof Alexander Semenoff. There is (it seems) no address given on the covers\nof the journal Electricity, but the name of the editor is there.\nM. PETROVO-SOLOVOVO.\nWith regard to the last circumstance it must be mentioned, however, that\nIlya Semenoff had been in St. Petersburg for some time before entering his\npresent situation with M. Doviakovsky and M. Sharoeff, so that it is\nimpossible to prove that the address of Electricity could not have been\nknown to him.\nOn Nov. 21 [December 4], 1901, M. Sharoeff wrote to me as follows :\n\" Sir,\u2014I comply with your request with pleasure.3 On Monday, Novem\nber 19th, I said that the indecision of the artelschik when presenting the\nreceipt in the Electricity office\u2014a fact certified by [M.] Schweder, technical\nengineer (secretary of Electricity), in a personal interview with him\u2014speaks\nin Semenoff's favour. Because, if the latter had been sent by some one to\nfetch the books, he could not have spoken in the Electricity office as follows :\n' Please say if I can receive books from you with this receipt,' but would\nhave simply said this : ' Please give me the books in exchange of this\nreceipt.' . . . [Signed] SHAROEFF.\"\n1 M. Doviakovsky did not seem to think this particularly strange.\u2014M. P.-S.\n2 He said to me that, being much impressed by the case, he narrated it in the presence\nof many persons, one of whom sent it to the Peterburgskaia Gazeta. \u2014M. P. -S.\n3 1 had written to M. Sharoeff, asking him about an incident he had mentioned during\nmy conversation with him, which I had not noted down at the time.\n\f278 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [OCT., 1902.\nIt must be said, however, that an examination of the receipt in question,\nwhich M. Sharoeff kindly sent on Nov. 30 [December 13th] for my\ninspection reveals the fact, which M. Sharoeff says he is astonished he had\nforgotten, that it bears the following note at the bottom :\n\" For receiving a personal ticket of admission to the meetings of the\nCongress, and also for receiving the printed 'Proceedings of the Congress,'\nthe presentation of a receipt in payment of a member's subscription is\nnecessary.\" The receipt itself, for payment of 10 roubles, is delivered in\nM. Sharoeff's name.\nWith regard to another circumstance to which I had called M. Sharoeff's\nattention,\u2014viz., my impression that during my first interview with Ilya\nSemenoff he stated to me that he had spoken about the dream both to M.\nSharoeff and M. Doviakovsky before its fulfilment,\u2014M. Sharoeff says he\nthinks Semenoff is somewhat confused about the matter, \"whether from\nweakness of memory or forgetfulness, I cannot judge.\"\nOn the whole, though my investigation of the sensational account\npublished by the Peterburgskaia Gazeta has deprived it of some of its striking\nfeatures (No. of receipt ; alleged absence of mention of \"Proceedings\" of the\nCongress of Electricians on the receipt), enough has been left to make the\ncase appear very striking still, and this in spite of a further deduction to be\npossibly made with regard to the address and the editor's name, asserted to\nhave been given in the \" message,\" owing to the impossibility of excluding\n\" latent memory \" in this particular case. M. PETROVO-SOLOVOVO.\n38 SERGIEVSKAIA,\nST. PETERSBURG, December 1\/14, 1901.\nWe wrote to Mr. Solovovo to enquire whether M. Sharoeff's dream\nhad occurred before or after he received the books from Ilya Semenoff,\nand asking also for an explicit statement from the latter that his brother\nhad not told him before his death that the books had been wanted.\nMr. Solovovo replied :\nST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 22, 1901 [Jamiary 4, 1902].\nI send you some more evidence re the Semenoff case, which I hope will\nsatisfy you.\nSome apparent discrepancies in statements he made to me at various times,\n(as to his having related his dream before its fulfilment to M. Sharoeff and\nM. Doviakovsky, then to M. D. alone ; as to the number of the receipt being\nmentioned in the dream1), make me think that we cannot by any means\nconsider him a good witness ; but neither M. S. nor M. D. doubting his\nveracity, these circumstances would not, I think, justify us in refusing to\nattach any value to the case. M. PETROVO-SOLOVOVO.\nP.S.\u2014The proofs M. Sharoeff saw in his dream Alexander Semenoff hand\nhim were not identical with the \" Proceedings \" of the Congress of Electricians\nbrought by Ilya Semenoff the next day.\n1 See account of my first interview with him ; but here I may have misunderstood him.\n\fOCT., 1902.] Case. 279\nThe following statement was enclosed in Mr. Solovovo's letter :\n(Translation of a Statement signed by Ilya. Semenof.)\nI certify that before my dream, in which my late brother appeared to me,\nI knew nothing about the existence of a receipt for receiving the Proceedings\nof the Congress of Electricians and about its whereabouts.\n(Signed) ILYA SEMENOFF.\nExtract from M. SharoefPs letter to me (M. P.-S.), dated St. Petersburg,\nDecember 21st, 1901 [January 3rd, 1902] :\n\"... The death of the artelschik Alexander was very much unexpected,\nboth to himself and to all those who knew him, so that neither Alexander\nnor any one else in the office did suppose that Ilya would be the deceased\nartelschitfs successor, the former being looked upon as merely temporarily\nfulfilling these duties.\n\" As for myself personally, I beg you to inform Miss Johnson that before\nreceiving the \" Proceedings \" I did not relate my dream to anybody, because I\ndid not attach any importance to it ; it was only when I got the Proceed\nings of the Congress that I paid attention to my dream. . . . SHAROBFF.\"\nIlya Sernenoff, whom I have just seen, now says that it was to M. Dovia-\nkovsky only, not to M. Sharoeff, that he related his dream before its fulfil\nment ; but that M. Doviakovsky did not pay any attention to what he said.\nM. P.-S.\nTEMPORARY REMINISCENCE OF A LONG-FORGOTTEN\nLANGUAGE DURING DELIRIUM.\nTHE following case presents some interesting analogies to many cases\nof secondary and alternating personalities that have appeared in our\nProceedings and Journal. The report is quoted (omitting some details\nof purely medical interest) from The Lancet of June 14th, 1902, where\nit appeared under the title \" Temporary Reminiscence of a Long-\nForgotten Language during the delirium of Broncho-Pneumonia,\" by\nHenry Freeborn, M.B. Edin., with remarks by C. A. Mercier, M.B.,\nM.R.C.P. Lond., F.R.C.S.Eng.\nThe patient was a woman, aged 70 years. She felt poorly on the evening\nof March 6th, 1902, and kept her bed on the 7th. I saw her on the 8th and\nfound her complaining of headache and pain in the shoulders, back, and\nlimbs. Her temperature was 102\u00b0 F., and her pulse was 100, regular, and\nstrong. Examination of the lungs revealed slight bronchial catarrh (the\npatient was very liable to slight attacks of bronchitis and had to keep her\nbed for a few days at a time once or twice during every winter). Her con\ndition on the 9th and 10th was about the same ; there were less headache\nand pain generally, the temperature remaining between 101\u00b0 and 102\u00b0. On\nthe llth the patient had passed a bad night, the respirations were quickened,\n\f280 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [OCT., 1902.\nthe cough was troublesome, the pulse was 120, and the temperature was\n105\u00b0. Examination of the lungs revealed increased bronchitis all over. . . .\nThe general condition of the patient remained about the same for two days,\nthe temperature being between 105\u00b0 and 106\u00b0, the pulse at this time being about\n120 and strong. On the 13th the temperature fell rapidly to 98\u00b0, went up\nagain for a short time in the afternoon to 101\u00b0, and fell again in the evening\nto 97\u00b0. On this day she coughed up a little rusty sputum, the only time she\ndid so. At 9 P.M. I arrived to find her apparently dying. The pulse was\nquite uncountable, weak, and flickering. The nurse said that she began to\nchange an hour before and was getting rapidly worse. Three minims of\nliquor strychniee were given subcutaneously. In 10 minutes the pulse could\nbe counted and in 20 minutes it was fairly strong at 110. It was found\nnecessary to repeat this dose every fourth hour and to give brandy and\ncarbonate of ammonia freely until the 16th, on which day she began to\nimprove and her pulse remained strong and slow without the help of the\nstrychnine. . . .\nThe chief point of interest in this case lies in the delirium. From the\nnight of March 7th until the evening of the 13th (when the temperature fell\nsuddenly) she was sometimes wandering while awake and continually talking\nin her sleep, but when spoken to would be perfectly sensible and so long as\nshe was engaged with one of the attendants or doctor would answer\nquestions, etc. When the temperature fell on the 13th she became quite\ndelirious and remained so until the 16th, when she gradually returned to\nreason. On the night of the 13th and on the 14th she was found to be\nspeaking in a language unknown to those about her. It sounded as if she\nwas repeating some poetry sometimes or carrying on a conversation at\nothers. She repeated the same poem time after time. This language was\nfound to be Hindustani. On the 14th, in the evening, the Hindustani began\nto be mixed with English and she spoke to, and of, friends and relations of\nher girlhood. On the 15th the Hindustani had disappeared altogether and\nshe was talking to, and of, friends of a later date in English, French, and\nGerman. The patient was born in India, which country she left at the age\nof three years and landed in England, after five months' voyage, before she\nwas four years old. Up to the time she landed she had been under the care\nof Indian servants and spoke no English at all, her only language being\nHindustani. On her coming to England the ayah was sent back and she\nthen began to learn English, and from that time had never spoken\nHindustani. She apparently, on the 13th, went back in her delirium to her\nvery earliest days, when she spoke again the first language she ever heard.\nThe poem was found to be something which the ayahs are in the habit of\nrepeating to their children and the conversations were apparently with the\nnative servants, one being recognised as a request that she might be taken to\nthe bazaar to buy sweets.\nThrough the whole delirium there could be recognised a sequence. As\ntime went on the friends she spoke of were of later date and she took events\nin their proper order. She apparently began at the beginning of her life\n\fOCT., 1902.] Reminiscence of a Long-Forgotten Language. 281\nand went through it until on March ] 6th she had reached the time when she\nwas married and had her children growing up boy and girl. It is curious\nthat after a lapse of 66 years, during which time she had not spoken\nHindustani, this language of her early childhood should be recalled in\ndelirium. The patient now speaks English, French, and German (one as\nfluently as the other), but although she knows a few Hindustani words she\nis quite unable to speak the language or to put one sentence together. She\nsays that she has no recollection (nor had she any before her illness) of ever\nhaving been able to speak Hindustani. The evidence that this language\nreally was Hindustani is that she does not know, uor has she ever known,\nany other language except those mentioned in this paper. A lady who has\nlived much of her life in India and who speaks the language recognised\nthe poem as one commonly in use amongst the ayahs and also translated\nsome of the conversations which the patient carried on with her imaginary\nvisitors.\nRemarks by Dr. MERCIER.\u2014This case is a most striking, one may say a most\ndramatic, instance of a state of things, which, in less impressive degree, is by\nno means uncommon and which, though abnormal, is not irregular. Events\nof the kind have been recorded before, but no case so complete, so extra\nordinarily perfect, and so well authenticated, lias yet been published as far\nas I know. The classical instance with which all such occurrences are com\npared and classed is that of the illiterate maidservant recorded by Coleridge\nin his \" Table Talk \" who, while suffering from the delirium of fever, recited\nfor hours in Greek and Hebrew. Many ye.trs before she had been in the\nservice of a learned pastor who had been in the habit of reading these\nclassics aloud in her hearing. She was totally ignorant of the languages in\nquestion and could not voluntarily reproduce a word of them. Yet in her\ndelirium they boiled up to the surface, and boiled over.\nIt is to be noted that it was not the forgotten language alone whose\nmemory was so strangely revived in this old lady's delirium. Her whole\npersonality was transported back to her early years, and she lived over\nagain the life of her childhood. She spoke of, and to, friends and relatives\nof her girlhood ; she asked that she might be taken to the bazaar to buy\nsweets. Now this is the rule in certain cases of senile insanity. Perhaps I\nmay be allowed to quote from my book on \"Psychology, Normal and\nMorbid,\" to illustrate what is meant : \" Along with this defect in the\nformation of structural memories\"\u2014and although Dr. Freeborn does not\nmention the fact, I have no doubt that this process was completely defective\nin the case that he has described, so that when the old lady recovered she\nremembered nothing of what occurred during this period of her illness1\u2014\n\" there frequently goes an excess of those memories that remain from long\npast experience. Not only are these memories preserved, but they are\nrecalled with exaggerated frequency and vividness. The memories of boy\nhood, for instance, are not only retained, but they are reproduced with\nexcessive frequency and with a vividness which in middle life was unattain-\n1 Dr. Freeborn says : \" This is so.\"\n\f282 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [OCT., 1902.\nable. We often witness in the dementia of old age that not only are the\nexperiences of the day forgotten, not only are the experiences of youth\nremembered, but the memories of youthful experiences thrust themselves\nforward with such vividness and persistence that they become the dominant\nfeature in consciousness, and the old man literally lives his youth over\nagain. To such a degree does this vivid reappearance of memories attain\nthat it sometimes invades the province of perception, and the veteran\naddresses his grandchildren by the names of schoolfellows of his own who\nhave long been dead, and with whom he has had no dealings since his boy\nhood. It seems as if structural memories were laid down in the nervous\nsystem in strata, the memory of each successive experience overlying the\nmemories of previous experiences ; and as if, in senile loss of memory, the\nremoval of the upper layers allowed of an over-activity of those that remain,\non the principle so familiar to neurologists under the name of 'loss of\ncontrol.' \"\nThat this old lady was not insane in the ordinary use of the term, but was\nsuffering from the delirium of bodily illness, goes to corroborate my\nfavourite doctrine that not only are delirium and insanity the same thing,\nbut that any weakening illness, especially if suddenly weakening, may be,\nand I should go further and say must be, attended by weakening of mind.\nIf the patient had remained in the same mental condition after her recovery\nfrom the bodily illness no one would question that that condition might be\nrightly characterised by the term insanity. Yet the improvement of the\nmental condition pari passu with the recovery of the bodily illness indicates\nthe dependence of the one upon the other.\nThe sequence of events in the course of her recovery was most remarkable.\nShe gradually passed through the stages of her life, beginning in infancy\nand taking them, as Dr. Freeborn says, in their proper order, until, upon\nher complete recovery, she brought events down to their present date.\nNothing so dramatically complete has ever come under my own observation,\nthough I have seen cases in which the period of life lived through again has\nvaried. It is a very common occurrence for persons who have acquired, so\ncompletely as to think in it alone, a language which is not that of their child\nhood, to lose that language in illness or in other stress and to return to the\nlanguage earliest acquired, even when this had been almost or quite forgotten.\nI have had under my care during the last year an old lady whose native\nlanguage is English, but who had subsequently acquired, in the order given,\na perfect colloquial mastery of French and Italian and a competent know\nledge of German. She is now 76 years of age and finds that she has lost her\nGerman, and in a severe attack of bronchitis she lost both French and\nItalian and was left with English alone. Her health is feeble and her\nmastery of Italian fluctuates with it. The great interest of the present case\nis that the language should have been discontinued so very early in life, that\nthe patient had not only forgotten it but had forgotten that she could ever\nspeak it. But, as Coleridge's case shows, the previous ability to speak a\nlanguage is not necessary for its reproduction, and it is unlikely that the\n\fOCT., 1902.] Reminiscence of a Long-Forgotten Language. 283\nchild herself had sung the verses. She probably reproduced them from\nhearing, as the servant girl reproduced the Greek and Hebrew. The\ngradual advance in the period of the patient's reminiscences, as her health\nimproved, goes to corroborate, for what it is worth, my hypothesis of the\nstratification of memories. I do not put it forward as a very illuminating\nhypothesis, but in this very obscure region even a glimmer of light is\ngrateful.\nSeveral cases of alternating personalities have been recorded in\nwhich the subject reverts to or recovers the memories of earlier\nperiods of life. One of the most remarkable of these was the case\nof Louis Vive (see Proceedings, Vol. IV., p. 496), who manifested\nseveral different personalities corresponding to different periods of\nlife, which variations could also be artificially reproduced in him by\ncertain methods of suggestion. Another case of alternating person\nalities corresponding to different ages was that of Mollie Fancher\n(see Proceedings, Vol. XIV., p. 396). More remarkable still, and still\nmore difficult to explain by Dr. Mercier's hypothesis of the stratification\nof memories, described above, is the case of \" Miss Beauchamp \"\u2014\nDr. Morton Prince's subject (see Proceedings, Vol. XV., p. 466)\u2014in\nwhom the principal secondary personality not only recollects the\nevents of extremely early childhood (such as lying in her cradle and\nlearning to walk), but also has a more complete and continuous memory\nof all the subsequent life than the primary personality has.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n[ The Editor is not responsible for opinions expressed by Correspondents. ]\nDR. HODGSON'S REPORT ON HIS SITTINGS WITH MRS. THOMPSON.\nTo the Editor of the\nJOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nI.\nAuy. 2nd, 1902.\nIf I may so far trespass upon your space, I should like to make one or two\nobservations upon the \"Reports of Sittings \" with Mrs. Thompson, published\nin the last number of the Proceedings. Now, judging from his published\n\"Report,\" it appears that Dr. Hodgson regards Mrs. Thompson as little\nmore than a conscious impostor ; that she was never in any trance state\nwhatever, and that what knowledge she did not gain surreptitiously was\nnot, in fact, knowledge at all, but merely lucky guesses made by the\nmedium, some of which were recognised by the sitter, as being especially\n\f284 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [OCT., 1902.\nappropriate to him (or her). Now I do not wish to champion Mrs.\nThompson's cause, but on reading over these Reports of Sittings, and on\ncomparing them with those of Mrs. Piper, in Proceedings, Vols. VI. and VIII.,\nI was certainly struck by the great similarity of detail between these two\nseries of trance phenomena ; and whereas Dr. Hodgson is alone in regarding\nMrs. Thompson as fraudulent, it must be remembered that numerous earlier\ninvestigators regarded Mrs. Piper in exactly the same light ; whereas\nDr. Hodgson\u2014and the majority of psychical researchers\u2014now claim that\nMrs. Piper is certainly not consciously imposing upon the sitter. The line\nis hard to draw : is Dr. Hodgson's Report to be taken as final, or does the\ncombined testimony of the other sitters warrant us in assuming that\ntelepathy \u2014to go no further\u2014is present in this case ? On this point, I take\nit, various investigators will form their own conclusions :\u2014the confirmed\nspiritist will entirely ignore his Report, and take every word uttered by\n\" Nelly \" to be solemn truth ; the sceptic, on the other hand, will receive\nthis verdict as final, and wonder where human credulity will cease, for\ncontinuing to \"believe in\" Mrs. Thompson after the completely negative\nreport of so trained an expert as Dr. Hodgson !\nYet, though the testimony of the latter be negative, there are, on the\nother hand, statements made which certainly seem to indicate that some\nsupernormal faculty is at work ; if not in Dr. Hodgson's series of sittings, at\nleast in those of Dr. van Eeden, Mrs. Verrall, and \"Mr. Wilson.\" The\ntestimony in some of these cases is quite strong\u2014in a few case*, remarkably\nso\u2014and it seems to me that if Mrs. Thompson be proved fraudulent\nthroughout, it would certainly cast a very lurid light upon the Piper case,\nand for the three following reasons :\u2014\n(i.) The great similarity between the two series of trance phenomena.\nThe similarity which exists between the trance state of Mrs. Piper and\nthat of Mrs. Thompson is more than merely superficial. A comparative\nstudy of the two series of reports displays a striking resemblance between\nthem, which may be seen in many little details. The action and the speech\nof the \"controls\" ; their methods of obtaining clues and giving information ;\nin short, the great similarity between \" Nelly \" and, e.g., Phinuit is borne out\nin many striking details, which, however, would take too much time and\nspace to recount here. They should be studied in the originals to be\nappreciated. If, it may be asked, we assume that one is genuine and the\nother fraudulent, how are we to distinguish between these \" controls,\" where\nthe resemblance is so great?\nOf course the honesty of the medium comes in here : that, in fact, is the\nwhole problem. Dr. Hodgson's dictum would have carried great weight,\nconsequently this series of sittings was an almost entire failure ! This only\nbears out Mr. Lang's remark (Journal, Vol. IX., p. 228), where he says,\u2014\" It\ndoes appear to me that, as a rule, she [Mrs. Piper] fails most with the kind\nof people whose affirmative evidence would be most valuable.\" And it must\nbe remembered (as before stated), that whereas Dr. Hodgson is quite alone\nin thinking Mrs. Thompson fraudulent, every one who studied her in England\n\fOCT. ,1902.] Correspondence. 285\nis entirely satisfied as to her honesty. Moreover, Mrs. Piper presented, at\none time, almost identical \" suspicious circumstances \" with those described\nin the Thompson case ; and several thoroughly competent observers declared\nnot only that Mrs. Piper failed to convince them of any supernormal faculty\nwhatever, but that, if they were to judge from their own sittings, \" the\nwhole thing,\"\u2014to quote the words of one of their number, Dr. S. Weir\nMitchell\u2014\" was a fraud and a very stupid one.\" '\nIn spite of this adverse testimony, however, Mrs. Piper continued to be\ninvestigated by the Society's members,\u2014 with the result, as we now know,\nthat she has succeeded in convincing the majority of the S.P.R. members\nof her honesty, and [has brought] some of them, at least, to a belief in\nSpiritism. In view of this, then, it seems to me that we should at least\nawait the result of future investigations before forming any opinion as to\nthe source of these trance utterances in the case of Mrs. Thompson.\n(ii.) The possibility of almost unlimited undetected fraud.\nBut besides these similarities between the Piper and the Thompson\nphenomena, there is a still more ominous note struck ; a greater suspicion\nwould be cast upon the Piper case by the proof of fraud on Mrs. Thompson's\npart than by any other method conceivable. In the first place, on the\ntheory of fraud, it would have to be supposed that Mrs. Thompson\ncompletely baffled the closest scrutiny of all the English researchers,\u2014\nMessrs. Myers, \" Wilson,\" Piddington, Sir Oliver Lodge, Mrs. Verrall, Miss\nJohnson, Dr. van Eeden, etc., \u2014 and that, consequently, the ingenious\nspeculations of Dr. van Eeden and the laborious investigations of Mrs.\nVerrall are all so much wasted energy ; merely speculations begun and\ntheories advanced to account for a series of phenomena which hi reality\nhad no existence at all ! If such were the case, then the researchers would\nindeed place themselves in rather a ridiculous position ; and, in the eyes of\nthe world in general, it would surely be no very great difficulty to suppose\nDr. Hodgson similarly bamboozled in the case of Mrs. Piper. If, on the\n1 See also the following opinions of careful observers :\u2014\nProfessor G. H. Darwin said\u2014\"1 remain wholly unconvinced either of any\nremarkable powers or of thought-transference.\" (Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 627.)\nProfessor Macalister declared that . . . \"if you ask my private opinion, it is\nthat the whole thing is an imposture and a poor one.\" (Vol. VI., p. 606.)\nMr. Shattock writes\u2014\"So that I cannot but think that the statements made are\nonly shrewd guesses, made on a carefully planned system.\" (Vol. VI., p. 639.)\nMr. J. F. Brown, again, writes that \"he is fully convinced that Mrs. Piper's\ndealings with him have been false and fraudulent throughout.\" (Vol. VIII., p. 85.)\nProfessor Pierce declares that ...\" I never for one instant felt myself to\nbe speaking with any one but Mrs. Piper. . . .\" (Vol. XIII. , pp. 461-62.)\nProfessor Baldwin stated that ...\" even as to the fact of her being in a trance\nat all, my impression is not strong, despite the fact that I came fully expecting\nto be convinced on that point.\" (Vol. XIII., p. 534.) See also the opinions of\nDr. Hopkins (Vol. VIII., p. 68) ; Dr. Wadsworth (Vol. VIII., p. 84) ; Professor\nTrowbridge (Vol. XIII., p. 526); etc.\n\f286 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [OCT., 1902.\nother hand, we admit\u2014on the strength of the outside evidence\u2014that Mrs.\nThompson is genuine, and that Dr. Hodgson had an unfortunately bad\naeries of sittings, everything at once falls into its proper place. Further, in\nreading over Dr. Hodgson's Report, I could not help feeling\u2014although the\nHodgson method of dealing with these phenomena appeals to my common-\nsense, and although I have that indefinable, subjective confidence in Dr.\nHodgson's judgment which one person thoroughly conversant with\nconjuring devices feels in another\u2014I cannot help feeling, I say, that Dr.\nHodgson investigated this case with a (perfectly unconscious) bias against\nits genuine character.\n(iii.) The finest \" test \" evidence would be rendered absolutely worthless.\nIt seems to me also that Mrs. Verrall's exceedingly dry but thoroughly\nscientific report and her treatment of the results obtained show pretty\nconclusively, \u2014either that Mrs. Thompson obtained her information sur\nreptitiously (in which case the Piper records will certainly be enveloped in a\ncloud of the blackest doubt),\u2014or that some supernormal phenomena were\nmanifested, occasionally, at least. These alternatives are brought into a\nsharp collision by the Report of Dr. van Eeden ; where chance seems clearly\nexcluded. In several cases, should fraud be proved to exist, I must confess\nthat I, for one, should lose a very large percentage of my faith in the\ngenuineness of the Piper phenomena. Here is one case by way of\nexample :\u2014Dr. van Eeden said (Proceedings, Part XLIV., pp. 77-78): \"I got\ninformation about objects whose origin was known only to myself. I\nbrought a lock of hair of a man who had lived and died at Utrecht, and the\nhair was immediately connected with that name, and on subsequent\noccasions referred to as the 'Utrecht hair.' I brought a piece of clothing\nthat had belonged to a young man who had committed suicide. Nobody in\nthe world knew that I had kept it, nor that I had taken it to England with\nme for this purpose, and yet T got an exact description of the young man and\nthe manner of his suicide, and even his Christian name was given. For me\nthis excluded all fraud or coincidence.\"\nSome of us, I am sure, anxiously await Dr. Hodgson's explanation of this\nincident. If it be proved that Mrs. Thompson obtained her information in\nthis case by normal means, it would certainly largely destroy the value of\nthe evidence for supernormal phenomena in the case of Mrs. Piper.\nI do not wish to be misunderstood ; I do not want this letter to be\nmisinterpreted. Its object is not to declare that Mrs. Piper must necessarily\nbe a fraud if Mrs. Thompson is proved to be one ;\u2014that would be simply\nabsurd. The point I wish to emphasise, however, is this :\u2014that if, after the\ncareful methods adopted to prevent inquiries, etc., in this case ; if, in spite of\nthe laborious Report of Mrs. Verrall, and such definite statements as those\nquoted above (by Dr. van Eeden) ; if, in spite of all this, Mrs. Thompson is\nno more than a clever impostor, and those who drew up the Report her\ndupes,\u2014then it would certainly seem that so great a blow would be struck\nat the value of the evidence presented in the Piper case, as to almost entirely\ndestroy the value of that evidence as a proof of any supernormal phenomena\n\fOCT., 1902.] Correspondence. 287\nat all. For it might very reasonably be urged that in that case the two\nseries of phenomena were certainly of the same genus, the difference being\nsimply one of degree and not of kind. If Mrs. Thompson be a fraud, she has\nso completely \" taken in \" and baffled her investigators that any other similar\nreports would be divested of almost all their evidential value,\u2014simply\ndegenerating into a matter of comparative dexterity between the two\nmediums. If, on the other hand, Mrs. Thompson be genuine, it would add\nmuch to the case of Mrs. Piper,\u2014already so fully supported by evidence\ntending to discredit the hypothesis of fraud. And so, while Dr. Hodgson's\nReport on Mrs. Thompson tends [in one respect] to support and strengthen\nthe evidence for supernormal phenomena in the Piper case by again bringing\nforcibly to the front his extraordinary acuteness in the detection of error\n(and thus indirectly strengthening any case in which he has failed to find\nit) : it does, on the other hand, most certainly tend to weaken, if not to\ndestroy, the value of the evidence in the Piper case by showing to what an\nextent fraud (granting it to exist in this case) may be carried without\ndetection. Believing, as I do, on the strength of the evidence presented,\nthat Mrs. Thompson does present supernormal phenomena, I must apologise\nto that lady for the tone in which this letter must (necessarily) be written.\nHBREWARD CARRINGTON.\nII.\nIn regard to Dr. Hodgson's sittings, I would point out that it is hardly\nsatisfactory for him to merely state his belief that Mrs. Thompson \" was in\na normal state the whole time \" without giving reasons. We all know that\nDr. Hodgson is an authority on Mrs. Piper's trance, but we have not the\nsame assurance that he is an authority on trance states in general ; and even\nif he were, he owes more than an opinion to a person who has given so much\ntime and work to the Society as Mrs. Thompson has.\nIt may be desirable to mention that her second states were not, as with\nMrs. Piper, induced by association with a spiritualist medium, but that they\narose spontaneously, and that she was accustomed to pass into them with\nfacility long before they took on their present form. Those who have had\nto do with hypnotism know that a good subject will pass from one state\nto another with great rapidity and almost without moving a muscle ; and it\nseems to me possible that Dr. Hodgson may have been misled by the ease\nand facility of Mrs. Thompson's trance, as compared with Mrs. Piper's,\nwhich at least used to be very laborious and rather painful to witness.\nIn view of Gurney's experiments as to the lapse of consciousness during\nactions suggested in hypnosis and performed during post-hypnotic states,\nit appears that there is always, in the case of persons liable to such states,\nthe possibility that the wish to reach a certain result may act as a self-\nsuggestion, and that the rest may follow automatically. Hence, where an\nexperimenter has not excluded the possibility of this, one hardly sees the\nuse of his offering an opinion as to what may, or may not, have occurred.\n\f288 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [OCT., 1902.\nThat Dr. Hodgson's sittings were conducted under loose conditions, not to\nsay carelessly, is a minor point ; because the most careful and experienced\nobservers cannot fail occasionally to make mistakes, and mistakes are often\ninstructive ; but when in working with loose conditions the observer abandons\nthe line of strict logic in interpreting his results,\u2014that does seem to me a\nsuperfluous error. It is true that Dr. Hodgson does not technically commit\nhimself to saying that Mrs. Thompson is a fraud,\u2014he just steers clear of\nthat,\u2014but in face of evidence to show that at times her mental state is not\nmerely abnormal but supernormal, he nevertheless rules out the explanations\nconsonant with such states, and which are ex hypothesi possible, and merely\nassumes normality,\u2014\"sacrificing,\" as Mr. Lang says, \"to common sense,\nwhich wants an explanation, and a normal explanation, and does not care\nwhether it is verifiable, or even plausible.\"\nI have been struck, when I have been in the States, with the general\ntendency to come to rapid conclusions, which is doubtless due to the\nintensely practical character of American life. In our own subject I found\nmost persons to be either pronounced sceptics or equally pronounced\nbelievers ; and we ma* take it, I think, that the atmosphere nf this country\n(or still more, Dr. van Eeden says, of Holland) is better suited to the study\nof questions which involve the balancing of probabilities and a philosophic\nsuspense of the judgment. As Faraday has said in a very interesting\nlecture: \" Occasionally and frequently the exercise of the judgment ought\nto end in absolute reservation. It may be very distasteful, and great fatigue\nto suspend a conclusion ; but as we are not infallible, so we ought to be\ncautious ; and we sh ill eventually find our advantage, for the man who rests\nin his position is not so far from the right as he who, proceeding in a wrong\ndirection, is ever increasing his distance.\"\nE.

In most cases\nthey had to depend for their facts upon strangers, since none of the\nmost active members in the Society had hitherto developed any power\nof their own. But if the more prominent members should begin to\nexperience remarkable powers in their own person, it would manifestly\nbe of the first importance.\nMRS. VERRALL then read a paper on \" Some recent Experiments in\nAutomatic Writing,\" of which a brief summary follows :\nMrs. Verrall said she had made several attempts in the course of the\nlast ten or twelve years to obtain automatic writing, but had met with\nno success until early in the year 1901, when, after renewed attempts,\nshe found herself able to produce fluent, though not wholly intelligible,\nLatin sentences. Since that time a considerable amount of writing\nhad been produced in Latin, Greek, and English. A great part of\nthe contents of these \" messages \" consist of adjurations to persevere,\nreproaches to the writer for stupidity in interpretation, and exhorta\n\f292 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1902.\ntions to patience; there have been no general ethical discourses nor\nany attempt at theological discussion. There is a very clearly marked\ndesire to produce statements that will be \" evidential \"\u2014statements,\nthat is, of facts unknown to the writer herself. The phraseology and\nvocabulary of the Latin and Greek present some peculiarities, and\nthroughout there is a constant play upon words and a use of linguistic\nanalogies quite foreign to the writer's own habit of mind. Among the\nmany efforts to obtain verifiable matter there seem to have been some\nsuccesses, and Mrs. Verrall related in detail three cases in which events\nhad apparently been recorded by her hand before their occurrence.\nIn the first two of the cases the statements of the script were meagre,\nbut in the third case a considerable number of details was given\nincluding three uncommon proper names, and an event corresponding\nin almost every particular occurred two months and a half after the\nautomatic script had been produced. Mention of the automatic script\nhad in this case been made to an independent witness at the time of\nits occurrence.\nAt five o'clock there was an adjournment for tea, and before the\ndiscussion on the paper took place, Mrs. Verrall read an account of an\nincident which seemed to show a connexion between her automatic\nwriting and the trance-communications of Mrs. Piper in America.\nOn January 28th, 1902, an experiment was suggested by Dr. Hodgson\nto the trance-personality, and on February 4th, at another sitting, the\ntrance-personality claimed that the experiment had been successful ;\nMrs. Verrall was not aware that any experiments were being attempted,\nbut on January 31st, a message in Latin and Greek was automatically\nwritten by her hand which appeared to imply knowledge of the very\ndistinctive experiment arranged between Dr. Hodgson and Mrs. Piper's\ncontrol.\nIn reply to questions, Mrs. Verrall said that she did not usually write\nin the dark. She was perfectly conscious, while writing automatically,\nof her surroundings, and she was aware at the moment of writing what\neach word was as she put it down, but she had no recollection of the\nwords when once they had been written, nor any general recollection\nof the sense of the sentence as a whole. The writings did not all\npurport to come from the same communicator ; indeed, it was im\npossible to trace any personality behind the incoherencies and variety\nof the statements ; in many cases there seemed to be descriptions of\npassing scenes, analogous to the fantastic visions seen in a crystal, but\nthere were also incidents suggesting telepathic communications with\nfriends of the writer.\n\fNov., 1902.] Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 293\nPROFESSOR BARRETT said that he considered the paper one of the\nmost interesting and valuable that had ever been read before the\nSociety, because it stimulated further work in a very important\ndirection. Referring to the cases related by Mrs. Verrall, he gave a\nfew other instances of prevision that had come under his own notice.\nThey were not so remarkable as Mrs. Verrall's cases, and they could\nalso be more easily accounted for by chance coincidence or by inference\nfrom knowledge normally or telepathically acquired. But if more\ncases like Mrs. VerralPs occurred, which were very difficult to explain\nby coincidence or by a heightened power of inference, prevision would\nnot only have to enter the field as a working hypothesis to explain\nsuch cases, but it would consequently become more legitimate to apply\nit also to cases of a less striking character, such as he had quoted.\nMRS. HOME said that her own experience of automatic writing\nwas not unlike Mrs. Verrall's. She got single words at a time, and\nnot consecutive sentences; and, although she understood, as it was\nbeing written, the meaning of each individual word, she did not grasp\nthe sense of the sentence formed by the words.\nSIR LAWRENCE JONES thought the paper showed the importance\nof care in the signing and dating of all cases, and so making them\navailable for future reference and investigation ; and he especially\nurged on crystal-gazers to record even what might seem to them at\nthe time trivial and unmeaning pictures. Time might reverse the\nverdict, and the scene or incident represented in the crystal-vision,\nthough it might remain trivial, might prove to be not unmeaning.\nMR. PODMORE remarked that the messages, which Mrs. Verrall was\ninclined to regard as precognitive, were open to more than one inter\npretation. The more oracular their form, the easier it was to discover\na variety of different meanings in them, and the difficulty of regarding\nthem as mere coincidencies was thereby reduced.\nIn reply to a protest from DR. A. WALLACE against the use of the\nword 'automatic' in connection with Mrs. Verrall's script, MRS. SIDGWICK\npointed out that the word ' automatic ' as used by the Society, was\nentirely neutral and non-committal. It connoted only such images\nas arise, or such movements as are made without the initiation of the\nnormal consciousness. In this case, as in others, it implied no expression\nof opinion as to the source of the messages.\nTHE PRESIDENT fully endorsed Mrs. Sidgwick's statement, and\nremarked that he found that the Society's use of the word ' hallucination '\nwas similarly misunderstood. They were often abused for calling\neverything a hallucination, but it was a hallucination whatever else\n\f294 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1902.\nit might be ; and so with this writing, it was not under the control\nof the ordinary brain consciousness, and was, therefore, in this sense,\nautomatic, whatever its source might ultimately turn out to be. He\nquite agreed with Sir Lawrence Jones how important it was to make\nnotes of any predictions. He considered they should not only\nbe noted down, but written on a letter-card and posted to the\nSecretary at the Rooms of the Society, and kept by him on a\nspecial file.\nThe worst of it was that when elaborate precautions were taken\nto record a predicted event in an unmistakable manner, the event\nhad hitherto not come off. Whenever it had come off there had been\nfound some slight loophole or flaw in connexion with the prediction,\nbut the flaw had not always been due to lack of detail or to the\npossibility of merely accidental correspondence; though in a large\nnumber of cases of prediction noticed in the newspapers that might\nbe an adequate explanation.\nEven a letter-card with postmark upon it is not utterly conclusive\nproof of a date, because a previous postmark might be fraudulently\nattainable : but a postmark as a supplement to endorsed testimony\nthat the letter was received by a responsible person was a valuable\ncorroboration. There were other methods of making even more\nabsolutely sure than that, and in one case of detailed prediction for\nan indefinite date he had himself adopted an elaborate procedure\nimpossible to elude. Unfortunately in that instance the event pre\ndicted had not occurred ; but perhaps it would not always be so.\nHe considered the Marmontel case a most remarkable one. The\nmore trivial the incident the better, in many ways and for many\nreasons. It would be apparent to anyone who had noticed the dates in\nMrs. Verrall's paper that her writing did not begin until after Mr.\nMyers's decease. He felt himself that there was a sort of atmosphere\nabout these writings as if some extremely intelligent influence was at\nwork, giving these predictions of events in the oracular way in which\nthey were given. They were given in a fashion which prevented\nanything like purposed fulfilment, or anticipation, or interference due\nto previous knowledge of what was going to occur. Mr. Myers had\nalways held that predictions of events, if only such predictions were\npossible, would afford the clearest and most crucial proof of supernormal\npower; and would likewise be the most effectual way of definitely\ntranscending the powers of telepathy, or even of ordinary clairvoyance,\nprovided the event predicted were of a kind such as could not reasonably\nbe inferred.\n\fNov., 1902.] Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 295\nHe had, that afternoon, mentioned the existence of a soi-disant Myers\ncontrol for the first time and this opened a large subject. The time\nwould come when the communications that purported to come from\nMr. Myers through Mrs. Piper and others must be collated and related\nto the Society, but that time had not yet come. He had them filed,\nbut as yet there was nothing crucial, nothing that would convince\na sceptic\u2014nothing that would convince himself\u2014of the clear identity\nand definite personal action of the supposed communicator. The 'sphere\nand spear' case, representing an attempt at correspondence between\nwhat was going on in America and at Cambridge, was the kind of\nexperiment that Mr. Myers had been anxious to make. Mr. Myers\nin his lifetime had attempted to get such correspondence in connexion\nwith America, but these experiments had resulted in failure. Hence the\n' sphere and spear ' message, whether in this case regarded as successful\nor not, was not unlike the kind of thing that Mr. Myers would have\nbeen likely to attempt.\nIn conclusion the President said that there were many things the\nreader of the paper had not had time to mention, but he understood\nthat this was only the beginning of the subject, and hoped that Mrs.\nVerrall would have further communications to make to the Society.\nThe meeting was then adjourned.\nINQUIRY INTO SENTIMENT WITH REGARD TO\nA FUTURE LIFE.\nIT is requested that any answers to the Questionnaire issued by the\nAmerican Branch (see the Journal for July, 1901), which have been\ncollected but not yet returned, should be sent to MR.

[Nov., 1902.\nTHE FIRE WALK IN MAURITIUS.\nTHE following communication refers to a letter from Mr. John Pid-\ndington, published in the Journal for June, 1902.\nROYAL HOSPITAL, CHELSEA, S.W., July 23rd, 1902.\nI have read with much interest Mr. Piddington's communication about the\nfire-walking in Mauritius, and have no doubt that during his long residence\nthere he has had far better opportunities than I had to study the question.\nI should, however, like to point out that when I was present there was no\nsign of any nervous or physical collapse on the part of the devotees, and the\npriest who crossed first, and was therefore exposed to the greatest heat,\nremained standing and watching the others with an air of complete com\nposure, and eventually walked slowly away. There are no logs of wood ; the\ntrench is filled with embers.\nI have, since writing my account, received a letter from a Resident\nMagistrate in Mauritius who attended the ceremony last January, and\nwrites as follows :\u2014\n\" MAURITIUS, January 12th, 1902.\n\" I write to you by the first mail after the fire-walking ceremony to tell\nyou what I can about it, but I am sorry to say that I cannot give you any\nthing truly scientific, nor, I fear, add anything to what you know already,\nas I understand you have actually witnessed it here yourself.\n\" It was doubtful until the last moment whether any fire-walking would\ntake place this year on account of the plague, and a notice was posted by the\nauthorities forbidding it. However on Jan. 2nd I went to the Stanley\nestate, near Rose Hill, with some of the police inspectors, and found the fire\nburning and almost ready at 4 P.M. I sat in a little hut, curiously decorated\nwith palmiste flowers and leaves, which adjoined the fire. The fire was com\nposed of wood and charcoal, and was so hot when I passed it to get to the\nhut that my face was nearly scorched. It was arranged in a heap about 3 ft.\nhigh, and was covered with white ash. It was situated in a trough dug in\nthe ground about 18 ft. long and about 4 inches deep, and at the far end was\na trough of water. About 4.45 the fire was spread over the trough in as thin\na layer as possible, and when spread it was in the form of a red hot layer of\nsmall pieces of wood and charcoal, each piece resting on the soil. From ten\nto 15 minutes then elapsed, during which the redness disappeared, and the\nembers became uniformly black. The procession of priest and attendant\nclergy (?) then arrived, and proceeded, to the strains of tom-toms and a sort\nof clarinet, twice round the trough. They had what I expect is usual, viz. :\ncurious brass pots of flowers on their heads, a sort of caduceus of Mercury,\nand other emblems which I do not doubt have names and meanings which\nhave been investigated by others. I saw no sacrifice, but I believe there\nwas one in an adjoining chapel. The excitement of the assembled crowd\n\fNov., 1902.] The Fire Walk in Mauritius. 297\nreached a climax when the priest and his party marched in single file down\nthe centre of the black ashes, at a slow pace, without any visible sign\nof terror or pain. The persons who had promised to walk then followed to\nthe number of about 12, including men and women carrying children. One\nman covered his face with branches of leaves in passing, perhaps to protect\nhimself from the hot vapour, and upon one face I saw terror more plainly\nmarked than I think ever before, the eyes \" starting out of the head \" on\napproaching the fire. Not one uttered any cry of pain, nor hesitated in the\nperformance, nor betrayed any sign of pain. On passing through the \" fire\"\nthey entered the water and disappeared in the crowd, but I did not see\nany one prostrated on the ground, nor any bandaging or tending of the feet\nafterwards. It is said that those who walk undergo a preparation of about\nthree weeks beforehand, and some say that some sort of dressing is placed\non the feet, but I do not k\/iow if it is true.\n\" Immediately after the last had passed, water from the trough was splashed\non the embers, and hissed and formed into steam. It was a hot day with a\nbright sun, but the steam was plainly visible. It seems to be a fact that the\nskin of the feet of the Indians is as thick as the sole of a boot, and a friend\ntells me that he has seen his servant extract something from his foot by in\nserting a piece of broken glass to the depth of about an inch. As they never\nwear boots and are scarcely ever lame notwithstanding, I think that this\nmay account for a good deal, and may explain what, to a newcomer, seems\nmysterious. I am told by some that those who walk the fire do not show any\nmarks on their feet ; on the other hand, one has told me that his man was\nnever the same afterwards ; but this may have been due to the sort of\nreligious ecstasy which attends the ceremony.\n\" I do not think that I can add anything more.\n\" Both my servants are Hindus, and so took no part. My gardener is\nfrom Madras, but he has become a Roman Catholic ; my cook says that the\ngardener would not walk the fire now, because if he did, so he fears, he\nwould be burnt.\"\nDoes not this add plausibility to the idea that the religious esctasy not only\nprevents fear, but may actually alter the sensitiveness of the skin, in the\nsame way that a hypnotised patient can be rendered insensible to pain, or\nconversely that blisters can be raised by suggestion.\nWhat is really wanted is the evidence of some medical man who would\nexamine the devotees both before and after the ceremony.\nM. S. SCHWABS.\nFIRE CEREMONIES IN SOUTHERN INDIA.\nMr. Andrew Lang has kindly sent us the following cutting from the\nTimes of Ceylon, October 4th, 1901. The explanation that the feet of\nthe fire-walkers are protected by being rubbed with the juice of the\naloe is not a new one and no doubt may apply to some cases. In other\ncases it has been specifically denied (see e.g. the account of Mr. H. K.\n\f298 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1902.\nBeauchamp, the editor of the Madras Mail, in the Journal for November,\n1900, vol. ix. p. 316).\nThe Madras Mail has the following in its correspondence column :\u2014\nSIR,\u2014You finished a leaderette on the 27th with the question : \" Who will\nexplain the mystery of the similar ceremony, with glowing ashes, in Southern\nIndia?\" It has evidently been forgotten that I explained this mystery in\nthe Madras Mail early in 1899. Also in your issue of the 21st February,\n1899, I described what I saw for myself, namely, a man passing red-hot\nchains through his hands, and picking a rupee out of a vessel full of boiling\noil, without suffering the least damage. There was not the least doubt that\nthe chains were actually red, and the oil actually boiling. The experiments\nwere made for me, as I was very sceptical, in broad daylight, by one of my\ncatechists who had himself been a saniyasi, and he told me he had often\nwalked over burning ashes without the least injury. All the feats are pre\npared for in the same way, i.e. the hands or feet, as the case may be, are well\nrubbed with the juice of the aloe, called by the Tamils sottrukattrdlei. I\nfelt the man's hands immediately he had passed the red-hot chains through\nthem from end to end, and found them hot, but not in the least degree burnt.\nWalking over red embers with feet whose soles must be about half an inch\nthick must be a trifling thing compared with handling red-hot chains. I do\nnot believe there is the least \" mystery \" in the matter, or that there is any\njugglery whatever. Scientific investigation ought to be made, because the\nfact might be turned to practical use. This is not my line, but I can vouch\nfor the truth of the facts, if I am entitled to any credence as an observer,\nand sign my name as a mark of genuineness. J. A. SHARROCK.\nTrichinopoly, September 28th.\nCASE.\nG 271. DREAM.\nOur first information of the following case was through a newspaper\ncutting kindly sent to us by Mr. H. P. Gurney, of the Durham College\nof Science, Newcastle-on-Tyne, in a letter dated January llth, 1902.\nThe cutting ran as follows :\u2014\nThe body of Police-Constable Egleton, who was stationed at New\nLambton, and has been missing since last Saturday afternoon, was found\nyesterday afternoon in Brecon Hill Plantation, about two miles from\nFence Houses. Deceased was lying in the deep part of a stream which\nruns through the wood. The body was at once taken from the water and\nconveyed to deceased's home to await an inquest. James Blunt, the man\nwho found the body, says that he had a dream that deceased would be\nfound as stated. He accordingly went there, and proved his dream to be\ncorrect. P.-C. Egleton was forty-five years old, and leaves a widow and\nfamily, one of whom, a grown-up son, holds a responsible position in the\nCivil Service. Deceased was a steady and highly esteemed constable. He\n\fNov., 1902.] Case. 299\nhad been nearly twenty-five years in the force, and was thinking about\nretiring on his pension. He was a native of West Mansley, in Sussex.\nIn reply to our enquiries, the following letter was received from the\noffice of the Durham County Constabulary :\u2014\nDURHAM COUNTY CONSTABULARY,\nDIVISIONAL SUPERINTENDENT'S OFFICE, HOUGHTON-LE-SPRING,\nFebruary 16th, 1902.\n. . . At the inquest held on the body of Egleton on llth January\nlast, the witness Blunt stated \"that on Wednesday night, 8th January,\nhe dreamt that he saw the body of Egleton lying at a particular spot\nin Houghton Burn that runs through Brecon Hill Wood. He went to\nhis work next day, and on coming home, and while at dinner, he told his\nwife and other members of his family of his dream. After getting his\ndinner he set off to the place in Brecon Hill Wood where he dreamt he\nhad seen the body, and with the aid of a rail he succeeded in raising the\nbody at the second try. It was lying in about four feet of water at the\nspot indicated in his dream.\" T. SNAITH, Supt.\nThe rest of the evidence was obtained for us by the kindness of an\nAssociate of the Society, Mr. W. M. Thornton, B.Sc., of the Durham\nCollege of Science, who took great trouble to investigate the case\nthoroughly and interviewed the witnesses. He reported on March\n25th, 1902, as follows :\u2014\n. . . On the night of Saturday the 4th of January last Police-Constable\nEgleton, stationed at New Lambton, Co. Durham, suddenly disappeared.\nHe was last seen by his sergeant about eleven o'clock. The latter having\nentered an inn to see all was right, found, on leaving a minute later,\nthat Egleton had gone. When he did not return home that night\nsearch parties were sent out, and during the next four days the whole\ndistrict was very thoroughly examined, but no trace of him could be\nfound. Some thirty or forty constables helped in searching. On Thurs\nday morning James Blunt, a workman at the coke ovens attached to the\nLambton Colliery, told first his son, then a Mr. Key, and afterwards\nseveral people together that he had dreamt where Egleton was, that he\nwas drowned in the stream running through a small wood not far from\nthe village. At midday on Thursday he went alone and found him,\nthree men who followed him arriving in time to see him try to raise the\nbody. The police and friends were informed, and the affair greatly stirred\nthe neighbourhood. I went to see Blunt and those connected with the\ndream, and found him in bed, but he evinced the greatest interest, and,\nsitting up, told me the case, which I jotted down and he signed. As you\nwill see, the others to whom he told the dream have also signed state\nments to that effect. I may say that, having had a good deal of\n\f300 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1902\nexperience with working men, Blunt struck me as absolutely straight\nforward, and there was not the slightest sign of self-consciousness in any\nof those to whom I spoke. . . . W. M. THORNTON.\nThe signed statements enclosed by Mr. Thornton, which he had\nobtained a few weeks earlier, were as follows :\u2014\n5 ENGINE Row, NEW LAMBTON, DURHAM,\nFebruary 15th, 1902.\nSome time in the middle of the night of the 8th of January, before the\ncaller came round, I dreamt that I saw the burn running through Brecon\nHill Wood, and in the stream by a stump of a tree. P.-C. Egleton was\nlying with his head to the stump, and I saw him in the dream lying in two\nfeet of water. On waking again and going out at five o'clock, I went to work\nat the coke ovens, and about seven o'clock I told my son, George, of the\ndream. Mr. Key, who is erecting the ovens, came round about ten, and I\nsaid to him, \" Mr. Key, I want to borrow that rake.\" He said, \" 'What\nfor?\" I said, \"I know where Egleton is. I saw him in my dream.\" He\nlaughed and turned away. When I came back from work at half-past one I\ntold them in the house. There were my wife, my daughter and her husband\npresent.\nAfter dinner I went straight away where the dream led me, and getting\nto the place I saw in the dream, I took a pole from the bank and tried\nin the burn for him. The first two times I touched the bottom, and the\nthird time I touched him. It was about six feet from where I first tried.\nMy son-in-law, James Bell, and his brother, Harrison Bell had followed\nme with William Brown ; they met on the way. I had raised him twice\nbefore they came, but couldn't get him out. They laughed and said, \" It's a\ndog you've got,\" but found it was not, and helped me to lift him out and\ncarry him to the bank. Then I came away to tell the friends, and they took\nhim home.

He finished his work, and\nafter washing, having his dinner, he got to the place in twelve minutes\nafter leaving home, put in his rake shaft, and raised the body up just as it\nhad appeared to him in the dream.\nStrange to say, a number of men had been past the same place.

January, 1902.\nJames Blunt of New Lambton, Coal Miner, Saith, I dreamed on Wednesday\nnight I saw deceased lying in the Burn below Mr. Gilchrist's, in Brecon\n\f302 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1902.\nHill Wood. I went to my work, and on coming home I told my Wife that\nin my dream I had seen Egleton. I then washed myself and went straight\nto the place I dreamed of, and there I found a long pole lying. I picked it\nup and put it in the Burn about twice, and the third time it came against\nsomething. I put the pole below, prised him up, and found it was the body\nof a man, and assistance came, and he was got out. There was about 4j feet\nof water in Stream, and before this a Search had been made all along it. I\nsaw there was a big mark on the edge as if from a man springing. There\nwere other print marks of persons concerned in the Search. The Stream is\nabout 10 feet broad, and it was somewhat deeper than on the day he was\namissing. I couldn't tell whether the big mark on the edge had been his\nattempting to jump across the beck\u2014or of some of the Search Party. I last\nsaw P.-C. Egleton on Xmas Day, and saw nothing about the place where\nfound to make me think he had deliberately placed himself in the Water.\u2014\nJAMES BLUNT.\nJames Bell of New Lambton, Coal Miner, Saith, on Wednesday just before\nBlunt went to Brecon Hill Wood I saw him at New Lambton, and he told\nme that in a dream he had seen Egleton lying in the Beck, and about 10\nminutes after I followed him down as he had told me the point to go to, and\nwhen I had got there he had the head and shoulders of his body eased out of\nthe Water. It was 300 yards on the road side of the Wood from the entrance\nto the Wood. His clothes were all in order with all on except his Cap. There\nwas no interference with the body till the Policeman came.\u2014\nJAMES BELL.\nTaken upon oath, Before me, C. MAYNARD, H.M. Coroner.\nA few more details are given in a later letter from Mr. Thornton,\ndated April 25th, 1902, as follows :\u2014\n. . . With regard to the Egleton case I don't think Blunt actually de\nscribed his dream in close detail to any one, and he seemed a little surprised\nhimself at finding the body so quickly.\nAs he told it to me the dream shewed him the body lying in some two feet\nof water with the head towards an old tree stump. When he actually touched\nthe body with the pole he took from the wood, he placed it beneath and\nraised head and shoulders clear of the water. This seemed as if the head lay\ntowards the bank, much as he dreamt it.\nThere was a good deal of water in the stream about that time, and it is\nvery probable some movement may have taken place between the time of the\ndream and the finding of the body.\nHis own version is that \" the spirit came and told me where the body\nwas.\" . . . W. M. THORNTON.\nThe evidence for this case is in many respects unusually strong and\ncomplete, since there can hardly be any doubt that James Blunt\ndreamt of the position of the body and told his dream to several\npersons before he had any\u2014at least, conscious\u2014knowledge of the\n\fNov., 1902.] Case. 303\nactual facts. Since, however, he had passed by, and even searched\nalong the bank of the stream, it is impossible completely to exclude\nthe supposition that his subliminal self may have noticed some marks\nfrom which it inferred where the body was lying, and that these\nindications while remaining unnoticed by the supraliminal conscious\nness, led to the dream.\nA CASE OF DOUBLE MISRECOGNITION.\nAbout May, 1901, Mrs. Piddington wrote to a friend. Miss Lilian\nAllen, of 2A Lower Grosvenor Place, S.W., inviting her to lunch. As\nshe received no answer for several days, she went to call at Miss\nAllen's house. Miss L. Allen was not at home, but her sister, Miss\nGertrude Allen, was. Mrs. Piddington- explained to Miss G. Allen\nthat she had called to find out if Miss L. Allen was coming to lunch\nwith her, as she had not written. Miss G. Allen said that her sister\nhad met Mrs. Piddington in the street and given her a verbal answer.\nMrs. Piddington denied this, and added that she had not seen Miss L.\nAllen for some months. Miss L. Allen then came in, and explained\nthe mystery as follows :\n\" Some days ago meeting a lady in the street, whom I thought to be Mrs.\nPiddington, I stopped her in order to speak to her. This lady aaid she had\nwritten me a note asking me to lunch ; but she did not mention the day or\nhour. I accepted the invitation, and we then walked together along the\nstreet for some minutes, and the lady conversed with me about my sister,\nand said : ' I've asked you and your sister.' In reply to this remark, I said\nthat my sister could not go out to lunch. [Miss Gertrude Allen being in\nbad health rarely goes out.] The lady looked slightly astonished, but we\nparted without further remark, I never doubting that I had been talking to\nMrs. Piddington. On my return home I found a note from Mrs. Piddington\nasking me to lunch. As I thought I had just given her a verbal acceptance,\nI did not send a written reply. This morning I met this same lady again.\nShe stopped me and explained that she had mistaken me for some one else,\nand I then found out my mistake. She explained that she had written to\nask two sisters to lunch ; and when, after her conversation with me (whom\nshe had mistaken for one of these two sisters), both sisters (I having refused\non my sister's behalf) turned up, explanations ensued, and she discovered her\nmistake.\"\nThe above was dictated to Mr. Piddington partly by Miss L. Allen\nand partly by Mrs. Piddington on August 1st, 1901, with the exception\nof a few alterations and additions made on May 12th, 1902, at Miss\nAllen's dictation.\nMiss Allen states that her eyesight is normal, and that she now sees\n\f304 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1902.\nthat there was a slight, but by no means a striking, resemblance\nbetween Mrs. Piddington and the lady whom she mistook for her.\nMiss Lilian Allen and Mrs. Piddington were well known to each\nother at the time of this incident, but Miss Allen admits that she is\nprone to mistaking people by sight. She has not up to the present\ntime (May, 1902) again seen the strange lady whom she mistook for\nMrs. Piddington. Another coincidence is that the strange lady spoke\nto Miss Lilian Allen of 'your sister Mabel,' and that Miss Allen\nreally has a sister Mabel.\nMiss Allen's and Mrs. Piddington's corroborations are appended :\nThe above account is perfectly accurate.\nMay 12th, 1902. (Signed) LILIAN ALLEN.\nThe above account is correct, so far as it concerns me.\n(Signed) PAULINE PIDDINGTOX.\nThe episode is instructive, because, had the mystery never been\nsolved, as might well have happened, it would have contained all the\nelements of what might not unreasonably have been claimed as a case\nof veridical hallucination. It might, it is true, be urged that such a\nclassification would not have been justifiable in view of Miss Allen's\nadmission that she is given to mistaking one person for another. But\nthe natural reply to this objection would be that, while due allowance\nshould be made for Miss Allen's tendency to misrecognition, still it was\nmore than discounted by the fact that the hallucinatory Mrs.\nPiddington not only recognized Miss Allen, but also gave to her a\nmessage which the real Mrs. Piddington had already, though not to\nMiss Allen's knowledge, sent her by post.\nWhen Mr. Podmore not infrequently has sought to explain by\nmisrecognition or coincidence phenomena which less sceptical observers\nprefer to attribute to thought-transference or to more debatable\ncauses, his argument has not made as strong an appeal as it might\nhave done had a greater number of cases of a similar type to the one in\nquestion been put on record. Not, indeed, that Mr. Podmore, so far as\nwe know, has ever ventured to stretch hypothetically the long arm of\ncoincidence so far as we find it stretched in the real instance before us.\nIt is quite likely that just as strange coincidences are happening\nfrequently, but they do not get recorded, because, as soon as they are\nseen to be explained in an ordinary way, they lose their interest.\nBut they ought to be recorded, and we shall be glad to receive\naccounts of recent and well-authenticated coincidences of the kind,\nwhich, while explicable by normal causes, simulate, so to speak,\nsupernormal phenomena.\n\fNo. CXCIV.-VoL.

The resigna\ntions of one Member and eight Associates were announced.\nA vote of thanks was passed to Mrs. Stewart for presenting a\nportrait of her husband, the late Professor Balfour Stewart, a former\npresident of the Society, to be placed in the Eooms at Hanover Square.\nVarious matters relating to the finances of the Society were discussed\nat length.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nTHE 118th General Meeting of the Society was held in the Hall\nat 20 Hanover Square, on Friday, November 14th, at 4.15 p.m.\nMr. A. F. Shand in the chair.\nMR. F. C. S. SCHILLER read a paper on \" Human Sentiment with\nRegard to a Future Life,\" embodying some of the conclusions which\nhe had drawn from an analysis of the answers received to the question\nnaire recently circulated by the American Branch. It is hoped that\nthe paper will be published in the Proceedings, and as it would not\nbe possible to give an adequate summary of a subject involving so\nmany details within the space at our disposal, no abstract of the\npaper is appended. For the same reason the subsequent discussion is\nbut briefly reported.\nTHE CHAIRMAN thanked Mr. Schiller for his extremely interesting\nand brilliant paper. The object of the inquiry of which it treated\nhad been to obtain for the Society a clearer notion of the currents of\nopinion which stimulated or diminished interest in their work. He\nthought the Society's labours had already modified to some extent the\nprevailing views ; for phenomena once treated with ridicule were now\nadmitted as legitimate subjects of scientific investigation.\nMR. SCHILLER, in reply to questions, said that no doubt the word\ning of some of the questions might have been improved upon, but the\nessential thing had been to frame questions which people would be\nwilling to answer. The practical lesson to be learnt from the results\nof the inquiry was that social sentiment was not with them to the\nextent that they had expected. A considerable proportion of intelli\ngent people cared for none of these things, and the future prospects of\nthe Society would largely depend on whether they succeeded or not\nin gaining the ear of these Gallios.\n\f308 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [DEC., 1902.\nCASE.\nG. 272.\nTHE following account of a haunted house was sent us on March 3,\n1902, by one of the chief percipients. Initials, frequently fictitious,\nhave been employed throughout, but the full names and addresses are\nknown to the Society, and Mr. Thomas has interviewed four of the\nprincipal witnesses and was favourably impressed by them.\nMr. W. G. D , who wrote the account and collected the\ncorroboratory evidence, has, since leaving M House, had two\nnon-coincidental hallucinations, one of an unrecognized female figure,\nand the other, after he had been ferreting, of a wounded rabbit.\nThe D family occupied M House till March, 1900. The\ngarden of the house has since been partly built over, and at the time\nof our investigation the house was being used as a store for old papers\nand documents.\nMr. W. G. D 's ACCOUNT.\nFor some time I have been thinking it would be of interest to write an\naccount of the \" Haunting \" of our old home, M House.\nThe apparition was a woman, tall, slight, and always dressed in a black\ncloak with a hood over her head, except once when I saw her for two or\nthree minutes in broad day-light : of which more shortly. We nearly all saw\nher at one time or another, very often with no apparent cause ; in fact, we got\nso accustomed to it that even my sisters were not at all nervous until some\none belonging to us was ill, for we always saw her if any member of the\nfamily were going to die.\nThe first time I remember was in Jan. 1893. My mother had retired\nearly, and two or three minutes after she. had gone upstairs, I, wishing to\nspeak to her, followed. When I got on to the landing I saw her room was in\ndarkness and heard her walking in my brother's room, which faced hers. I\nstood still, and in a short time she (as I thought) came out, passed me and\nwent into her room, I close on her heels. She crossed the room as if she was\ngoing to light the gas, by which time I was well within the door. As she did\nnot do so, I thought she could not find the matches, and spoke to her. I said\n\" Mother,\" and at the same time my brother's door opened and she came out.\nIt had not been she that I had followed. I made some remark, and went to\nmy brother and told him what I had seen. He thought I had been mistaken,\nand said I must have fancied it. However, the next morning she was taken\nill and died within three weeks.\nI saw the \" Lady,\" as we called her, some time after this, but, as I did not\nmake a note at the time, I cannot give the exact date. I had stayed in bed\nwith a slight cold, getting up about half-past eleven, and was nearly dressed,\nwhen I heard one of my sisters come upstairs and go into the store-room,\nwhich was up three stairs from the landing. I went to the foot of these\nstairs, and was just going up when I saw M was not alone. Her\n\fDEC., 1902.] Case. 309\ncompanion was very tall and had yellow hair, but what struck me most was\nthe way she was dressed, a long gown, the waist right under the arms and\ncovered with small flowers. My first thought was, \"whoever has M got\nwith her 1 \" then, \" why does that girl always keep behind M 1 \" I did\nnot go in, as I had my coat off, but stood for a minute or two wondering\nwho it could be in such a remarkable \"rig-out,\" when M\u2014\u2014 came out of the\nroom and, making some remark, went downstairs. Then for the first time it\nflashed across my mind there was something strange about the person I had\nseen, and whom I had not lost sight of for a minute until M had gone,\nwhen she had walked across the room beyond my view. I went in and\nlooked, but could find nothing that would in any way account for it. The\nroom was only about nine feet by five, had a large window facing the door,\nand was lined with shelves all round, with absolutely nowhere in which any\none could hide. I told one of my other sisters about it, and she asked me\nnot to mention it to M 1, as she had been feeling rather nervous for a day\nor two, but we would see if anything happened. Nothing did.\nThe next time she was seen was when my father was dying. My eldest\nsister, who was sitting up with him on Jan. 21, 1900, came downstairs for\nsomething about half-past twelve a.m., and passed a figure in black on the\nfront staircase. She was too much troubled to take much notice at the time,\nbut thought again about it in the morning and told me of the occurrence.\nMy father died at ten o'clock, which was about half-an-hour after she had\ntold me what she had seen.\nAnother strange thing happened the night after he died. My brother\nF and I were sitting in the drawing-room after all the others had gone\nto bed. We had been there for perhaps half-an-hour, when the piano began\nto play of its own accord ; it started at mid C and went down in minor thirds.\nI heard it first, but made no remark, having often heard it before, and so\nhad others members of the family. But at the second or third note F\njumped out of his chair, saying, \" whatever is the matter with that piano ?\"\nHe was as white as death. \"Don't touch it,\" I said, and going across\ntook out the knee and front boards, during all of which time it went on\nwith its weird runs. When it was all exposed, we saw that the wires were\nall vibrating, but the hammers were not moving. I had thought it might\npossibly be a mouse or rat, but, of course, when I had opened the piano I\nsaw that was not the explanation. It still went on till we heard C\n(another brother), who had come downstairs for some hot water, unbolting\nthe door of the kitchen passage, and called for him to come into the drawing-\nroom : when it stopped and did not make itself heard again. So after a bit\nwe went to bed feeling very mystified.2\nNothing further was heard or seen until Feb. 18th, when I saw the\napparition again. I had been sitting reading after the others had retired\nfor the night, and it would be between twelve and one when I started\n1 \"M \" is referred to later as \"Mrs. 0 .\"\n2 In connection with this incident it should be mentioned that Mr. W. G. D is\nby profession an organ-builder.\n\f310 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [DEC., 1902.\nto go up to bed. When I got to the top of the stairs I saw the door\nof my father's room was open, the gas full up, and standing before the\ndressing-table, resting her hands on it and gazing into the mirror, was\nthe apparition. I stood still for a second, then moved to try to see\npast the figure into the mirror in order to get a view of her face. The\nfirst part of this was very easy, as the dressing-table was in the corner\ndiagonally to the door, so that by moving a little to one side I could\nsee very well into the glass, when what was my surprise to see there\nwas no reflection. Just as I made this discovery she turned partly round,\nbut not enough to enable me to see her face, and moved across the room\nbeyond my vision. I rushed in, but there was nothing to be found, so\nwaited for a few minutes, and, as she did not return, I put out the gas\nanil went to bed. The next day my sister-in-law died, which made three,\nto put it at the least, strange coincidences.\nShe was seen once more before we left the house. That was on March 2nd.\nI had remained at the works till ten o'clock, and was very tired when I got\nhome. After supper and a smoke, on going upstairs about eleven, I saw the\nsame figure standing on the landing. She went into my father's room as I\ngot to the top of the stairs. As there were no lights at the time except the\nlarge glass lantern in the roof of the staircase, I thought it might possibly\nbe an effect of light and shade, so walked backwards downstairs again, but\ncould not reproduce the phenomenon. I said nothing about it in the\nmorning, and almost forgot it till during the day, when I was seeing a\nfriend off by train. I heard my name called from further down the train,\nand saw a cousin, who told me she had been telegraphed for to go to her\nfather who was dying. (He died the same night.) I said to my sister when I\ngot home, \"I saw the 'black lady' last night.\" \"Oh!\" she remarked,\n\" Uncle A is worse.\" (He had been ill for some weeks, but we had\nno reason to expect his immediate death.) \"By Jove !\" said I, \"you have\nhit it. I saw N at tlie station, and she told me she had been sent for.\"\nWe have here five appearances, four of which coincide with a death.\nAs I said before, it was seen many times by other members of the family,\nbut, as there have been no careful notes kept by them, I can give no detailed\naccount, nor do I enlarge on the noises of footsteps, the opening of doors,\nand similar phenomena ; but will only mention one other circumstance\nwhich happened after we had left the house.\nMy brother F was superintending the removal of a lot of old furuiture\nwhich we were sending down to the auction rooms. One of the men who\nwas doing the work had brought a large retriever dog, which F was\ngoing to pat, when its owner told him not to, as it was so savage. They had\ngot everything out, and the house locked up, when they discovered the dog\nwas missing. The door being opened, they found him pressed against the\nwall, so paralysed with terror that his master had to fetch him out, as he\ndared not move.\nSuch was the last we had to do with the \" M House Ghost.\"\nMarch 3, 1902. (Signed in full) W. G. D .\n\fBBC., 1902.] Case. 311\nOn March 22, 1902, Mr. W. G. D wrote in reply to a letter\nfrom Mr. N. W. Thomas to say that he would welcome and assist in\nany investigation undertaken by the Society, and added :\n\" My report was written from memory with the exception of dates, as I in\nnearly every case told some one in the house what I had seen, and therefore\ndid not trouble to make notes.\"\nOn March 29, 1902, he sent the following corroboratory evidence :\n(1) of his brother C\n25th March., 1902.\n... I fancy my earliest experiences at M House must have been\nrather in the hearing than the seeing line. As of course you will remember\nI was a fearfully nervous and highly-strung child ; nor must you forget the\nnightly horrors I underwent in the world of dreams.\nTo this day I recall most vividly lying in bed and listening to the sound\nof a heavy footfall on the stairs at the back of the house\u2014Thump, thump !\nI call it a footfall, but it was rather a succession of loaded knocks appearing\nto mount the stairs. All that is more than twenty years ago, yet, to this\nday, I am puzzled to account for those noises.\nThe most terrible of all my experiences took place when I was about six\nor seven years of age. At that time, as you will remember, I was sleeping\nwith you in the room which faced the top of the staircase. One night I\nawoke\u2014as to the time I have little or no idea\u2014but it was, to use a vener\nable term, \" in the middle of the night.\" You were asleep. There was a\nsufficiently large gas for one to see things plainly. Suddenly I was conscious\nof a strange noise in the passage outside as of someone slithering along in\nloose slippers. The door was slightly ajar ; it now moved slowly and\nsilently open, and there entered a shape and stood beside the bed. How\ncan I describe that for which there are no words adapted ? It was white,\nbulgy, and unutterably loathsome ; that is all I can say. I remember I\ngave a piercing yell, and fled from the bed to the shelter of the next room,\nnot however before the thing, whatever it was, had taken its departure. My\nfirst action had been to cover my head with a shield of bedclothes, and when\nI ventured to look again \" Bogey \" had gone. It was a credit to your powers\nof sleep that through all this you did not awake.\nThe only occasion on which I saw \"the lady\" must have been when I was\nabout twelve years old. It was the night of your birthday, which I cannot\nremember, but either your eighth or ninth. You and F were both in bed\nand asleep, but I remember the date because the Pater had purchased some\n\" animal books \" for you that evening, and I wanted to have a look at them\nbefore I went to bed. I left the supper-table rather earlier than the others,\nleaving all the family downstairs except E . As I crossed the corridor\nupstairs I saw her (as I imagined) standing, with her back towards me,\nbefore the washing-stand in the Pater's dressing-room. I went into your\nbedroom ; there was E sitting reading by the bed. \" Why,\" said I in\n\f312 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [DEC., 1902.\nastonishment, \"were you not in father's dressing-room just now?\" \"No,\"\nshe answered. (Indeed, as she was talking to me she could not have been in\nthe dressing-room at the other side of the house not thirty seconds before.)\nWe went and made a search, but, of course, found nothing.\nRe your curious experience with the Mater, I am a little vague. I\nremember it, but not in detail. From the point of view of evidence, my\nmemories on the subject are hardly worth putting down. I should be pre\npared to sware to the truth of the incident, because I have so often and for\nso many years heard you relate it without variation of a single detail, but I\ndo not remember that you told me of it the night that it took place. You\nmay well have done so, however, and I may well have forgotten it, as at the\ntime I was entirely obsessed by the idea of the loss consequent on R.'s\nleaving England.\nWith regard to the piano episode I can be much more explicit. It was the\nnight of the Pater's death ; time about 11 o'clock, maybe a little later. I\nhad gone upstairs to bed leaving you and F in the drawing-room.\nComing down for some hot water to the kitchen, I was in the act of unbolting\nthe door leading thereto, when suddenly from the other end of the passage\ncame your voice. I turned and saw you. You said : \" C , come in here,\nthe piano is playing.\" I remember saying \" nonsense,\" or something of that\nkind, but came at once. The music, however, had stopped ; the piano was in\na more or less dismantled condition, and you both told me how you had been\nsitting by the fire, when suddenly F said to you, \"Why, the piano's\nplaying ! \" You had heard it before he spoke, and now jumping up rushed\nto the instrument and took off the front. I remember the whole thing as\nvividly as if it had happened yesterday. C D .\n(2) of his brother F\n25th March, 1902.\nMy brother wishes me to send you a short account of the incidents con\nnected with M House, of which I was a witness.\nThe first I remember was the night my father died. He [i.e. Mr. W. G.\nD.] and I were sitting in the drawing-room after the other members of the\nfamily had gone to bed. I should say the time would be about 11 o'clock.\nSuddenly without any warning the piano struck several notes, as though to\ntest the instrument, and then started running up in a sort of scale several\ntimes. We jumped up, and my brother went across to the piano, and took\nthe front and knee-board out, exposing the whole of the front of the piano.\nI thought it must have been a rat or a mouse, but, though the strings were\nvibrating, there was no sign of anything, and if there had been we could not\nhave failed to see it.\nThe second occurrence was after we had removed from the house, and I\nwas superintending the removal of some old furniture to the auction-room.\nOne of the men had a large retriever dog, which, its owner said, was very\nsavage, as when I was going to pat it he cautioned me not to do so, as it\nwould probably go for me.\n\fDEC., 1902.] Case. 313\nBy some mischance the dog got locked into the house, and it was perhaps,\nten minutes before we discovered that it was missing. When we did, and\nopened the door to look for it, we saw it crouched in the passage looking up the\nstairs in such a state of fright that its owner had to fetch it out, as it would\nnot turn its back to the stairs to come to the door.\nAs regards the rest of my brother's statement, I can only say that in\nevery case he told me of seeing the figure before the death followed, and that\nas far as I know he is absolutely correct in every detail.\nF D .\n(3) of his sister K .\nMy brother has asked me to write an account of what I saw on the 21st of\nJanuary, 1900.\nMy father was ill of pleurisy, and I went downstairs out of his bedroom\nevery hour, to fetch fresh hot bran-bags from the kitchen.\nThe kitchen was at the end of a long passage, into which all the down\nstairs rooms opened. The drawing-room and dining-room doors faced each\nother. I had left the gas lights in the passage and on the staircase partly up,\nand there was a kind of twilight, but quite sufficient to see anything by.\nAs I came partly up the passage to go upstairs, I saw a figure in black\nstanding between the two doors. I could not see the face, for it seemed to be\ncovered all over with this black drapery, and when I looked again it was\ngone. I thought I was mistaken and there had been nothing there. In the\nmorning my father was better, and we thought the danger was over, but he\ndied suddenly of heart disease about 10 a.m. My brother told me twice\nwithin the following four weeks that he had seen some one, but each time it\nwas upstairs in the room in which my father had died. In each case it was\nfollowed by death, my sister-in-law's on the 18th of February, and my\nuncle's on March 2nd. [Mr. W. G. D gives the dates as the 19th of\nFebruary and the 3rd of March.]\nThe figures he saw were of women, the one I saw was black, but so draped\nthat I could not see whether man or woman. K D .\n(4) of his sister Mrs. P .\nMarch 29, 1902.\nIn answer to your letter, I twice saw the lady who walks M House.\nThe first time, in November 1882, I was going upstairs, and had just reached\nthe landing by the green door, when, to my surprise, I saw her going up the\nfour stairs leading to the back bedroom. I followed, for she looked very\nnice in a long satin dress and some lace like a scarf round her neck. She\nsuddenly disappeared in the darkness. I am sure of the date, for it was just\nafter my engagement was broken off. I told T , and said I wondered if\nit was a warning about R . The next time was also in the winter. She\nwas standing outside the front door, and I was coming downstairs ; she looked\nso hard, and then disappeared. I went into the drawing-room, and mother\nsaid : \" Come to the fire, child, you do look cold.\" I was frightened by the\n\f314 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [DEC., 1902.\nlady disappearing aa she did. I must also say, being born on the stroke of\ntwelve midnight, many people say it gives second sight.\nE, S [an old servant] was here last night, and told me what she\nsaw. She seemed very frightened about the cellar, and says the figure\nbeckoned her with its finger. This history is quite true in every word.\nM C P .\n(5) of the servant R S , (obtained through Mrs. P ).\nWhile living as cook at M House, I twice saw the lady in white.\nThe first time was one Saturday night. I had been having a bath late, and\nwas taking the bath back across the landing, when I saw some one. I\nthought it was Miss M , and went into my room and shut the door ;\nthen, thinking that rude, I opened the door and saw the lady fall through\nthe third or fourth stair. I said, \" Oh ! Mary, Miss M has fallen through\nthe stairs. Come and look.\" We could find nothing, and the stairs were\nquite firm. The second time was after a party, and I was the last to go to\nbed. The lady came out of the bedroom on the right-hand side of the back\nstaircase. She had a small roll of papers in her hand. She again went\nthrough the stairs. I also once saw a tall figure in white, in the cellar at\nthe end of the passage, with one finger held up. I was very much\nfrightened, and let the jug of beer I had been getting fall.\nThis is quite true, and I sign my name. R S .\n(6) of his sister N .\nI never while at home saw anything in the way of an apparition.\nI remember mother thinking she saw a tall woman, dressed in black, cross\nfrom one of the front sitting rooms to the other. The date must have been\nbetween 1884 and her death, as she thought it was A M [a living\nfriend].\nAs far as I remember, M fancied that she saw a lady dressed in white\non the back stairs. I am sorry to say I cannot remember the date. I\nbelieve no important event followed either of these. N .\nWith regard to the above statements, Mr. W. G. D wrote on\nMarch 29, 1902, as follows :\nYou will notice my sister and brother C and F are able to substan\ntiate most of the details of my first report, and C mentions one other\noccurrence which is of interest : i.e. seeing a lady on one of my birthdays.\nIt was May 1st, 1884. I was ill in bed, and E was sitting with me.\n(I was seven at the time.) I remember C bringing up the books, and\nasking E to come out of the room. I did not know at the time for what\nreason, but have often heard them speak of it since.\nThe other statements \u00abre from two of my sisters, one of whom (M. P )\nwas married before any of the events I have mentioned took place. The\nother was at home till some time after the death of my mother, and it was\n\fDEC., 1902.] Case. 315\nto her I mentioned having seen some one in the store room with M , but\nunfortunately she has no recollection of the occasion.\nMrs. P brings forward two more instances of the figure being seen, and\nshe also sends me a statement made by R S , a cook we had for some\nyears at M House, and who is sister to my sister's maid, to whom she\nhad confided having seen \" something \" at her old place. She in turn told\nmy sister, who, knowing of my researches, sent for the girl, asked her what\nshe had seen, took it down, and asked her to sign it. It is rather strange\nthat she never mentioned it while she was with us, but there is certainly\nsome truth in it, as I do remember her breaking the jug, and saying there\nwas a man in the cellar, for my brother F and I went to investigate,\nbut, of course, found nothing. I know the apparition was seen by my\nmother, also by another sister who is at present travelling on the Continent\nwith her husband, but as she will be away for some mouths, I am not able\nto get a statement from her. [Obtained later, see Mrs. C.'s letter below.] I\nshould perhaps mention that the person referred to by Mrs. P as R\nwas not the same as the one 0 mentions by the same initial.\nA few weeks later Mr. W. G. D sent the following answers to\nthe questions which are here given within square brackets :\n[Q. How many times in all was the figure seen ?]\n1. I am not able to give the number, as she was certainly seen several\ntimes by my mother, and may have been by others when I have not heard.\nI have mentioned every time since 1893, including the statement by\nE. S . In all seven appearances.\n[Q. Did you compare notes ?]\n2. I do not think we ever compared notes as to the figure being the same\nin all cases. My father was very much against the subject being mentioned\nat all, and was very much displeased if we did so, which makes it very\nunlikely that the servants ever heard anything about a \" ghost.\"\n[Q. Was the figure seen outside the front door the same as the figure seen\ninside the house ?]\n3. I am sending you Mrs. P 's letter in regard to this question.\n[Q. Did other servants see an) thing ?]\n4A. I have reason to believe that other servants have seen something, but\ncan say nothing definite on this point. I asked my sister to see the house\nmaid we had at the same time we had R S (and whom she refers to\nas Mary in her statement), and to ask her if she ever saw anything during\nthe time she was with us, but with no good results. The girl would only\nsay, \" It does not do to tell all one sees.\" I then interviewed her, but could\nget nothing more out of her. From her manner both my sister and I thought\nshe had seen something, but would not say what. Then again, we have had\ntwo or three girls suddenly give notice for no reason at all that we could\nmake out. They would say they were sorry to leave, were very happy, but\nsomething had unsettled them.\n\f316 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [DEC., 1902.\n[Q. Had the house the reputation of being haunted ?]\n4s. I do not think the hoiise had the reputation of being haunted, though\nI have been asked two or three tim,'S by people I met for the first time if we\nhad seen anything, and, when I pressed them for their reason for asking,\nthey would say they had \" heard things,\" but they would never give a\nproper explanation of what they had heard.\n[Q. Did every one see or hear something ?]\n4c. It is difficult to say as regards strangers. My three eldest brothers\nnever saw anything, nor yet my sister N .\n[Q. Did you investigate the piano only once, and did others hear the\npiano ?]\n5A. I have come downstairs to the piano in the middle of the night, but\nbeyond looking to see if the lid was closed (which it in every instance was)\nI have never investigated. I am afraid I am to blame for no other member\nof the family mentioning the piano. When I asked for their statements I\nput the question in the form, \"Have you ever seen anything?\"; it would\nhave been better to have said \"seen or heard anything.\" My eldest sister\ntells me she has often heard it, but has not cared to go downstairs in the\nmiddle of the night to see what it was. You will also see from the enclosed\nletter from Mrs. W [a married sister] that she heard it when she was at\nhome. Then again, it is hardly likely that F and I would have the\nsame hallucination at the same time.\n[Q. Why was C incredulous ?]\nSB. C 's incredulity was, I think, more expressed than felt. If you notice,\nhe only said, \" Nonsense,\" or some such remark, to himself when I called\nhim. He certainly believed the piano had been playing when he came into\nthe room ; therefore it is most probable that he spoke to reassure himself.\nYou must remember he was down the long passage, which was quite dark at\nthe time : we had had a most trying day, and, to my mind, there was no\nwonder if he felt nervous at being told the piano was playing on that\nparticular night.\n[Q. Were the steps always the same ?]\n6. I shall answer No. 8 with this, as the animals were very prominent\nfigures with regard to the footsteps. So far as I can find out, except in the\ninstance mentioned by C , we all heard the steps the same, just as if\nmade by a person walking slowly. We very often heard them on a Sunday-\nnight. The servants were always allowed to go to Church, and one of my\nbrothers or I always stayed in the house, and generally one of my sisters\nwould be in with us. We used to sit in the drawing-room, and had the dogs\nwith us, or in the passage. (We generally had from two to four dogs of one\nkind or another.) Suddenly one of them would start to whine, then they\nwould all start, and if they were in the passage would scratch at the door to\ncome in. Then we would hear footsteps going up and down the passage or\nmoving across the rooms overhead ; and in this latter case we could never\nget the dogs to go upstairs even when we went. Sometimes the steps would\n\fDEC., 1902.] Case. 317\ngo on for a moment or two, and again they would continue for the whole\nevening off and on, until the dogs were nearly mad, and we would let them\ninto the garden, where they would quiet down. This last fact is of great\ninterest, as we had an acre and a quarter of ground, and had the noise been\nan acoustical freak caused by some one in the yards or garden, the dogs\nwould have found them. I have asked my eldest sister and my brothers\nC and F if they remember this, and they say they do, not once, but\nmany times. I believe the dogs were never with us on the occasion of the\nfigure being seen.\n[Q. Was there a history attaching to the house ?]\n7A. Not that I can [? find out] about,\n[Q. Who were the previous occupiers ?]\n7s. The B s had the house before we took it. They kept a large school\nfor boys, and were in the house for eighteen years. Before them the\nH s, and prior to them a Dr. W .\n[Q. Can you place the S.P.R. in communication with former occupiers ?]\n7c. I am afraid it would not be possible.\n[Q. How were animals affected 1]\n8. See reply to No. 6.\n[Q. Can you explain further about the reflection in the looking-glass ?]\n9. I see from a photo of the plan I sent you I have put the dressing table\nvery much too far in the corner. It should have been half-way across the\nwindow, which would make the glass in front of the right hand side of the\nwindow frame. The table is 1 foot 8 inches wide from back to front, and\nthe glass an old-fashioned one on a stand of its own, which brings the glass\nabout 10 to 11 inches from the front of the table. The figure, as I have\nsaid, was standing resting her hands on the table, which would bring her\nface very close to the mirror, under which conditions, I think, I should have\nseen a reflection had there been one, I enclose you a photo of the table and\nglass which were in my father's room at the time.\n[Q. Have any members of the family had similar experiences elsewhere ?]\n10. No, I believe not.\n[Q. Why was your brother incredulous on the occasion of the first\nappearance mentioned in your narrative ?]\n11. Here again, I think, the incredulity was only expressed. If you\nnotice, I say : \" He said I must have fancied it.\" I do not think he doubted\nmy statement for a minute. It was the first time I had ever told him of\nseeing anything, and I suppose he thought it would be well to make me\nthink I had been mistaken for fear of me becoming nervous.\n[Q. How long was R S with you ?]\n12. E S was with us from January 19th, 1898, till the Sunday\nbefore my father died, when she had to go to the Hospital with housemaid's\nknee. [i.e. about two years.] She was away for two or three months\nbetween whiles, but I cannot give you the exact date.\n\f318 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [DEC., 1902.\nI am afraid I have given you a long letter to wade through, but could not\nanswer your questions in much less room. I am expecting my sister home\nin about three weeks, and will then send you a statement from her. It is no\ntrouble to answer any questions you like to ask. I am only very pleased to\nbe able to contribute any material that is of interest to the Society.\nWith these answers the following letters from two of Mr. W. Gr. D.'s\nsisters were sent :\nFROM MRS. P .\nApril 2ls(, 1902.\nThe lady on the outside of the front door was most certainly the same\nfigure I had seen before on the stairs, and I at once recognized her. We\nlooked very hard at one another, and while so doing she suddenly dis\nappeared: If you remember how much glass there is in the front door, she\ncould not have gone away without my seeing her turn. Then the time of\nthe year\u2014winter\u2014no woman would be out in the cold without some\ncovering on her head except in evening dress, and as the dogs were in the\nroom, they would have at once known if any real person was about.\nI am perfectly certain the lady I saw twice was the same person, and that\nshe was a voung woman, very lovely, about 18 to 20 years of age.\nM P .\nFROM MRS. W .\nApril 21st, 1902.\nIn reference to your question of Saturday last as to whether I saw or\nheard anything of an unusual nature whilst living at home (M House),\nI certainly plainly recall the following :\nI was one afternoon crossing the hall between the dining and drawing-\nroom when I became conscious of a grey veiled presence at my elbow. My\nimpression was of a tall, slight (although misty) woman clothed in a long\ncloak. I was tired at the time and thought I must be mistaken, as the\nglimpse was a momentary one. When I looked again I was alone. I may\nremark I felt no sense of fear. I slept for some years in, the room we called\nthe \"haunted room.\" Whilst there I was frequently seized with such\nsudden and awful attacks of unreasoning and unaccountable terror that\nI was thankful for the company of my small terrier dog in the room with\nme. The horror I felt was too intangible to put into words ; it was rather\nan oppressive sense of an unseen and terrible presence with me. I may\nremark Frenehie (the dog) would never sleep anywhere but on the bed. In\nmy present house he never attempts to move from the floor, and I can only\nthink he too felt the influence of the room .\nI slept for some time with K , and on many occasions she spoke to me\nwhen I was falling asleep to bid me listen to the piano. On two or three\noccasions I too heard faint sounds of music, but not so frequently as she did.\nI usually fell asleep earlier than she did.\nI have a vivid recollection of one occasion when mother followed the\n\fDEC., 1902.] Case. 319\n\"presence\" from the hall door into the drawing-room. It was early one\nsummer evening, just growing \"less light\" without being at all dusk. She\nhad been out calling, and came in by the side door to miss the long drive.\nShe came quickly the whole length of the hall and came into the drawing-\nroom where I was sitting, and then went into the dining-room and returned\nimmediately with an expression of great surprise : \" Where is Miss M ? \"\nshe said, \" I thought she came into this room. Is she upstairs ? I do not\nsee her.\" We told her there was no visitor in the house. She exclaimed :\n\" There is certainly a visitor, and I think it is Miss M by her height. I\ncould not possibly be mistaken. She walked from the door into this room\nimmediately before me. I did not see her come into the house, but I saw\nher most distinctly as soon as I came in.\" We searched the house and found\nno one. Mother said she had not been able to see the face, as \"the\npresence \" had her back towards her. She spoke of a tall woman clothed\nin black. Mother felt no fear, and was almost difficult to convince that\nthere was no actual visitor with us. She said she had never lost sight of the\nfigure for a moment until reaching the drawing-room door (strangely\nenough just where I thought I saw the figure I write of. I also never saw\nher face).\nI have simply written you a bald statement of facts set down just as I\nremember them, and have not mentioned the various times when different\nmembers of the family told me they had seen the figure, or, as we called her,\n\" the gray lady.\" \" E W .\nOn May 28, 1902, Mr. W. G. D wrote as follows :\nI have pleasure in sending you the statement you desired from Mrs.\nC as to her experiences at M House. The two persons she mentions\nare N , from whom you have already heard, and L , a cousin we had\nstaying on a visit at the time. It seems to me possible th\/it the grey figure\nseen may have been the same figure in white which has been often seen,\nwhen we take into account that it was night at the time.\nThe extreme terror of the dog she mentions in the last case I remember\nvery well.\nI have been hoping to let you have an account from my cousin, but she\ndoes not seem very willing to send it. Should she do so I will forward it to\nyou.\nFROM MRS. C .\nMay 26th, 1902.\nThe first time I remember seeing anything of an unusual character at\nM House was when I was about 1 5, five years after we first went there. I\nslept with N in the room to the right of the top of the large stairs. We\nwent to bed and to sleep as usual, when I awoke with a great feeling of\ndread to feel something quite close to me. As far as I remember (and the im\npression is very real even now) it was a grey veiled figure, and the head seemed\nalmost to rest upon my bed. I did not see the face. The next time was\n\f320 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [DEC., 1902.\nwhen father and the girls were at Whitby. I was sleeping in the same\nroom, and was alone that night. I do not know if I had slept or not, but I\nheard heavy steps begin at the top of the stone stairs and go right down to\nthe bottom of them. I did not feel really afraid then, as it sounded very\nlike mother's step, but, when I went to her, the passage was quite\ndark, she had not left her room ; you, C , and the servants (the only\nother people in the house) had also not been out of bed.\nThe last time was when I was sleeping with L (a cousin), in the room to\nthe right hand of the stairs where father and mother and H died. We\nhad our old dog under the bed, and Rex, my little dog, upon it. We both\nheard a strange loud noise. I got up to be met at the door by C , and\nyou came out of your room at the very same time. Rex barked very\nmuch, but would not leave the bed, and the large dog we could not move\nat all, he just lay, and nothing would make him come out. We found\nnothing.\nThis completes the available evidence, as a statement by the cousin\nhas not been sent.\nDr. William Vincent, a member of the S.P.R., kindly endeavoured to\ntrace and interrogate former occupiers of M House. Unfortunately\nhe could only get into communication with two, and their evidence is\nnegative.\nA nephew of one former occupier, writes Dr. Vincent on May 23,\n1902, \"gave me a negative history as to any report of the supposed\nhaunting of M House. He tells me that he was very familiar\nwith M House when a boy.\"\nA daughter of the same former occupier wrote as follows on May\n26, 1902, in reply to inquiries from Mr. N. W. Thomas :\n\" I have received your note, but I think you have been quite misinformed as\nto M House. During all the years I lived there, I never saw or heard\nof anything unusual that could not be traced to \" rats,\" of which there were\ncertainly a number, as a horse-dealer occupied the adjoining premises.\"\nSince the above was printed, a second-hand (almost equal to first\nhand) account of the haunting of M . House between 1882-1885\nhas been discovered among the unpublished G. cases preserved at the\nS.P.R. Rooms. A comparison of the two records discloses certain\ndiscrepancies, not, however, of fundamental importance; and these\nwill be discussed in a subsequent number of the Journal, in which\nextracts from the earlier report will appear.\n\fJOURNAL\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research\nINDEX TO VOL.
