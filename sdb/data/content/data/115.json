In later life he pursued an interest in psychical research, in particular reincarnation.

He studied journalism at University College, London, then worked as a journalist and briefly as a schoolteacher, before training for the priesthood at the Anglican Theological College at Wycliffe Hall, Oxford. He was ordained in 1942 and in 1946 was appointed an assistant master and chaplain at Harrow School. He was a gifted athlete, competing at a high level in boxing and race-walking. He married in 1967, was widowed, and remarried in 1971.1  Psychical Research\n\nChristie-Murray joined the Society for Psychical Research in 1945. In retirement, having left the priesthood, he wrote and lectured on theology and psychical research. His 1978 book Voices from the Gods contains a survey he carried out on glossolalia, the phenomenon of \u2018speaking in tongues\u2019.2\n\nHe chaired meetings of the SPR Council between 1979 and 1981, deputizing for its US-based presidents JB Rhine and Louisa Rhine. He resigned shortly afterwards following a disagreement over the financial mismanagement of a publications project, for which he accepted responsibility. With him went the SPR\u2019s treasurer, who inaugurated the rival Association for the Scientific Study of Anomalous Phenomena (ASSAP), for which Christie-Murray acted as archives officer.3  Reincarnation\n\nChristie-Murray\u2019s main interest in the field of psychical research was in reincarnation. In his 1981 book Reincarnation. Ancient Beliefs and Modern Evidence, he&nbsp;assessed evidence and theories, considering religious views,&nbsp;the recollections of both adults and children,&nbsp;the activities of mediums in s\u00e9ances,&nbsp;d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experiences,&nbsp;and past-life hypnotic regression.\n\nHis idea of the \u2018essential me\u2019 combined the ideas of Roger Woolger, a British Jungian psychoanalyst and regression therapist, with data about past life memories documented by researchers. &nbsp;He held that reincarnation is a matter of conviction, not of proof,4 which he considered is 'almost always beyond the human condition'.5  Selected Works  Books\n\nVoices from the Gods.
