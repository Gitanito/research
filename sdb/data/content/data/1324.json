The Preface to the journal states that the\"aim of The Occult and Biological Journal is two-fold: first it endeavors to unveil to the student the mysteries of the higher truths, for which the Western mind is now seeking in the mysticism of the past and in Oriental religions; shows the correlation of the doctrines of the Orient and those of the Christian religion, and uses the wisdom of the past to throw new light on Biblical text; and, secondly, to those whose desire is individual unfoldment, it gives a special course of instructions, presents methods for increasing the amount of life in the organism, for its conservation and control, thus insuring the magnetic power so necessary to success in all directions.\u201d  These methods, in turn, were advertised in separate booklets: \"Practical Methods to Insure Success: A Booklet Bound in White and Gold, Its Instructions have been Followed by Thousands in Europe and America,\" and \"Special Instructions for Women (Woman\u2019s Circular), A Booklet of 42 Pages; Instructions in the Regeneration of Life\" (\"A few months\u2019 trial will convince the most skeptical that the methods recommended are not experiments, but the result of much thought and actual knowledge obtained through personal observation and experience.\").
