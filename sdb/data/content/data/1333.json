Com-\nmerce then took another route, and defcended to tb<;\npoint of the Red Sea~ to th'e canals of Sefofl:ris (Set;\nStrabo) .and wealth and activity were transformed tq\nMemphis. This is manifeflly what Diodorus means1\n:when he tclls.us (Lib~ I. feel:. 2.) that as foon as Mem~\np.l}is was efl:abliihed and made a wholefome and ddieiou~\nabode, kings abandoned Thebes tq fix ~hemfelves there,\nT~us Thebes continued to decline, and Memphis t<?\nflourith till the time of Alexander, who, building Alex.\nandria on the border of the fea, caufed Memphis to fall\nin its turn; fo that profperity and power feem to hav~\ndefcended hifl:orically fi:ep by flep along the Nile: whenc~\njt refults, both phyfically and hifl:orically, that the exift-\nen.~e of Thebes was prior to the~.t ofthe other cities.

The fecond mode. of\ncarrying on the trade was by means of veffcls with decks\nof the fize of our long boats, whic;h were able to pafs the\nfirait and to weather the dangers of the ocean : but for\nthis purpofe it was neceffary to bring\u00b7 \u00b7the wood from\nMount Leban}ls and Cilicia, where it is very fine and in\ngre;rt abundance. . This wood was firH: conveyed in floats ,\nfi\u00b7om Tarfus to Phenicia, for which reafon the veffels\nwere called \u00a3hips of Tarfus: \u00b7rrom wl}cnce it has been\nridicul0ufly inferred, that theywcnt round the promon-\ntaryof Africa as far as Tortofa in Spain. From Phenicia\nit was tranfported on the backs of.camels to the Red 'Sea,.\nwhich practice fiill continues, becaufe tbc fuores of thii\nfea are abfolutely unprovided with wood even for fuel.\nThefe veffels fpent a complete year in their voyage, that\nis, failed one year, fojourned another, and did not return\ntill the third. This tedioufi1efs was. owing, firft to their\ncruizing from port to port, as they do at prefe!).t:; fecondly,\nto their being detained by the Monfoon :Currents; and\nthirdly, becaufe, according to the calculat~ons .of Pliny and\nStrabo, it was the ordinary practice among the ancients\n'to fpend three yeats in a voyage of twelve hundred\n. leagues~ Such a commerce muft have been very expen-\nfive, particularly ili they were obliged. to carry with them.\ntheir provifions and even frelh water.

This alternative of a route\ntither by the Red Sea or by the river Euphrates was to\nthe ancients, what in later times has been the alternative\nin a voyage to the Indies, either by croffing the lfthrims ,\nof Suez or doubling the Cape ofGood Hope. It appears \u00b7\nthat till the time of Mofes this trade was carried on acrofs\nthe defert of Syria and Theais; that afterwards it fell\ninto the hands of the Phenicians, who fixed its fite upon\nthe Red fea, and that it was mutual jealoufr that induced\nthe kings of Nineveh and Babylon to undertake the de\u2022.\nfirutl:ion of .Tyre and Jerufalem.

By the ftagnation of thefe waters an epidemical\ndifeafe of the moft fatal nature was occalioned. It follows\n\u00b7from hence, 1. That all the flat country bordering upon\nthefe rivers was originally a marlh; 2. That this madh\ncould not have been inhabited previoufiy to ~he conftruc-\ntion of the banks in quefiion; 3\u00b7 That thefe bankS could\nnot have been the work. but of a population prior as to\ndate : and the elevation of Babylon therefore muft have\nbeen pqfierior to that of Nineveh, as I think I have chro-\nnologically dcmonfirated in the memoir above cited.
