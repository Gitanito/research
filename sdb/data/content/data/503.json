L\nDigitized by Google\n\f.-\nDigitized by Google\n\f[ 3 ]\nOBJECTS OF THE SOCIETY.\nIt has been widely felt that the present is an opportune time for\nmaking an organised and systematic attempt to investigate that large\n.group of debatable phenomena designated by such terms as mesmeric,\npsychical, and Spiritualistic.\nFrom the recorded testimony of many competent witnesses, past\nand present, including observations recently made by scientific men of\n-eminence in various countries, there appears to be, amidst much illusion\nand deception, an important body of remarkable phenomena, which are\nprima facie inexplicable on any generally recognised hypothesis, and\nwhich, if incontestably established, would be of the highest possible\nvalue.\nThe task of examining such residual phenomena has often been\nundertaken by individual effort, but never hitherto by a scientifio\n~ociety organised on a sufficiently broad basis. As a preliminary st.ep\ntowards this end, a Conference, convened by Professor Barrett, was\nheld in London, on January 6th, 1882, and a Society for Psychical\nResearch was projected. The Society was definitely constituted on\n.February 20th, 1882, and its Council, then appointed, have sketched\no()ut a programme of future work. The following subjects have beii1\n-entrusted to special Committees :-\n1. An examination. of the nature and extent of any influence\nwhich may be exerted by one mind upon another, aparl>\nfrom any generally recognised mode of perception.\n2. The study of hypnotism, and the forms of so-called mesmeric\ntrance, with its alleged insensibility to pain; clairvoyance\nand other allied phenomena.\nS. A critical revision of Reichenbach's researches with certain\norgani~tions called \"sensitive,\" and an inquiry whether\nsuch organisations possess any power of perception beyond\na highly exalted sensibility of the ,recognised BCnsory organa.\nigitized byGoogl\n\f4 ObJect8 oj tile Society.\n4. A careful investigation of any reports, resting on strong\ntestimony, regarding apparitions at the moment of death.\nor otherwise, or regarding disturbances in houses reputed\nto be haunted..\n5. An inquiry into the various physical phenomena commonly\ncalled Spiritualistic; with an attempt ~ discover their,\ncauses and general laws.\n6. The collection and collation of existing materials bearing\non.the history of these subjects.\n,The aim of the Society will be to approach these various problems\nwithout prejudice or prepossession of any kind, and in the same\nspirit of exact and uninipassioned inquiry which has enabled Science\nto solve so many problems, once not less obscure nor less hotly\n.debated. The founders of this Society fully recognise the\nexceptional difficulties which surround this branch of research;\nbut they nevertheless hope that by patient and systematic effort\n- some results of permanent value may be attained.\nThe Council desire to conduct their investigations 8.s far as possible\nthrough private channels; and they invite communications from any\nperson, whether intending to join the Society or not, who may be dis-\nposed to favour them with a record of experiences, or with suggestions\nfor inquiry or experiment. Such communications will be treated, if\ndesired, as private and confidential. .\nLetters relating to particular classes of phenomena should be\naddressed to the Hon. Secs. of the ~spective Committees, as\n.follows ! -\n(1) Committee on Thought-reading; Hon. Sec., PROFESSOR W.\nF. BARRETT, 18, Belgrave Square, Monkstown, Dublin.\n(2) Committee on Mesmerism; Hon.
