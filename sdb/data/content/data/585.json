Broad is the path and wide is the way that leadeth\nthereinto. Flattering bait is spread before the entrance : the dis\ntinguished names of one's predecessors in the office ; the absence of\nany active duties ; England and America symbolically made one in\nthat higher republic where no disputed frontiers or foreign offices\nexist ;\u2014and all the rest of it. But when the moment comes to\nretrace one's steps and go back to private life, like Cincinnatus to his\nplough, then comes the sorrow, then the penalty for greatness. The\ncareless presidential mouse finds the wires all pointing now against\nhim, and to get out there is no chance, unless he leave some portion\nof his fur. So in resigning my office to my worthier successor, I send\nthis address to be read across the ocean as my ransom, not unaware, as\nI write it, that the few things I can say may well fall short of the\ndignity of the occasion and the needs of the cause for which our\nSociety exists.\nWere psychical research as well organised as the other sciences are,\nthe plan of a presidential address would be mapped out in advance.\nIt could be nothing but a report of progress, an account of such new\nobservations and new conceptions as the interim might have brought\nforth. But our active workers are so few compared with those\nengaged in more familiar departments of natural learning, and the\nphenomena we study so fortuitous and occasional, that two years must,\nas a rule, prove too short an interval for regular accounts of stock to\nbe taken. Looking back, however, on our whole dozen years or more\nof existence, one can appreciate what solid progress we have made.\nDisappointing as our career has doubtless been to those of our early\nmembers who expected definite corroboration or the final coup de\ngrace to be given in a few short months to such baffling questions as\nthat of physical mediumship, to soberer and less enthusiastic minds\nthe long array of our volumes of Proceedings must suggest a feeling\nof anything but discouragement. For here, for the first time in the\nhistory of these perplexing subjects, we find a large collection of\nrecords to each of which the editors and reporters have striven to\n\fPresident's Address. 3\nattach its own precise co-efficient of evidential value, great or small, by\ngetting at every item of first-hand evidence that could be attained, and\nby systematically pointing out the gaps. Only those who have tried\nto reach conclusions of their own by consulting the previous litera\nture of the occult, as vague and useless, for the most part, as it is\nvoluminous, can fully appreciate the immense importance of the new\nmethod which we have introduced. Little by little, through con\nsistently following this plan, our Proceedings are extorting respect\nfrom the most unwilling lookers-on, and I should like emphatically\nto express my hope that the impartiality and completeness of record\nwhich has been their distinguishing character in the past, will be held\nto even more rigorously in the future. It is not as a vehicle of\nconclusions of our own, but as a collection of documents that may\nhereafter be resorted to for testing the conclusions and hypotheses of\nanybody, that they will be permanently important. Candour must be\ntheir very essence, and all the hesitations and contradictions that\nthe phenomena involve must appear unmitigatedly in their pages.\nCollections of this sort are usually best appreciated by the rising\ngeneration. The young anthropologists and psychologists who will\nsoon have full occupancy of the stage will feel, as we have felt, how\ngreat a scientific scandal it has been to leave a great mass of human\nexperience to take its chances between vague tradition and credulity on\nthe one hand and dogmatic denial at long range on the other, with no\nbody of persons extant who are willing and competent to study the\nmatter with both patience and rigour. There have been isolated\nexperts, it is true, before now. But our Society has for the first time\nmade their abilities mutually helpful.\nIf I were asked to give some sort of dramatic unity to our history,\nI should say first that we started with high hopes that the hypnotic\nfield would yield an important harvest, and that these hopes have\nsubsided with the general subsidence of what may be called the\nhypnotic wave. Secondly, I should say that experimental thought-\ntransference has yielded a less abundant return than that which in the\nfirst year or two seemed not unlikely to come in. Professor Richet's\nsupposition that if the unexplained thing called thought-transference\nbe ever real, its causes must, to some degree, work in everybody at all\ntimes (so that in any long series of card-guessings, for example, there\nought always to be some excess of right answers above the chance\nnumber) is, I am inclined to think, not very well substantiated.\nThought-transference may involve a critical point, as the physicists\ncall it, which is passed only when certain psychic conditions are\nrealized, and otherwise not reached at all\u2014just as a big conflagration\nwill break out at a certain temperature, below which no conflagration\nB 2\n\f4 President's Address.\nwhatever, whether big or little, can occur. We have published records\nof experiments on at least thirty subjects, roughly speaking, and many\nof these were strikingly successful. But their types are heterogeneous ;\nin some cases the conditions were not faultless ; in others the observa\ntions were not prolonged ; and generally speaking, we must all share in\na regret that the evidence, since it has reached the point it has\nreached, should not grow more voluminous still. For whilst it cannot\nbe ignored by the candid mind, it yet, as it now stands, may fail to\nconvince coercively the sceptic. Any day, of course, may bring in fresh\nexperiments in successful picture-guessing. But meanwhile, and lack\ning that, we can only point out that our present data are strengthened\nin the flank, so to speak, by all observations that tend to corroborate\nthe possibility of other kindred phenomena, such as telepathic\nimpression, clairvoyance, or what is called \" test-mediumship.\" The\nwider genus will naturally cover the narrower species with its\ncredit.\nNow, as regards the work of the Society in these latter regards,\nwe can point to solid progress. First of all we have that masterpiece\nof intelligent and thorough scientific work\u2014I use my words advisedly\n\u2014the Sidgwick Report on the Census of Hallucinations. Against\nthe conclusion of this report, that death-apparitions are 440 times\nmore numerous than they should be according to chance, the only\nrational answer that I can see is that the data are still too few, that\nthe net was not cast wide enough, and that we need, to get fair\naverages, far more than 17,000 answers to the Census-question. This\nmay, of course, be true, though it seems exceedingly unlikely, and in\nour own 17,000 answers veridical cases may have heaped themselves\nunduly. So neither by this report then, taken alone, is it absolutely\nnecessary that the sceptic be definitively convinced. But then\nwe have, to strengthen its flank in turn, the carefully studied cases\nof \" Miss X.\" and Mrs. Piper, two persons of the constitution\nnow coining to be nicknamed \" psychic \" (a bad term, but a handy\none), each person of a different psychic type, and each presenting\nphenomena so chronic and abundant that, to explain away the super\nnormal knowledge displayed, the disbeliever will certainly rather call\nthe subjects deceivers, and their believers dupes, than resort to the\ntheory of chance-coincidence. The same remark holds true of the\nextraordinary case of Stainton Moses, concerning which Mr. Myers\nhas recently given us such interesting documents. In all these cases\n(as Mr. Lang has well said of the latter one) we are, it seems to me,\nfairly forced to choose between a physical and a moral miracle. The\nphysical miracle is that knowledge may come to a person otherwise\nthan by the usual use of eyes and ears. The moral miracle is a kind\nof deceit so perverse and successful as to find no parallel in usual\n\fPresident's Address. 5\nexperience. But the limits of possible perversity and success in\ndeceit are hard to draw\u2014so here again the sceptic may fall back on\nhis general non possumus, and without pretending to explain the facts\nin detail, say the presumption from the ordinary course of Nature\nstill holds good against their supernormal interpretation. But the\noftener one is forced to reject an alleged sort of fact by the method of\nfalling back on the mere presumption that it can't be true because, so\nfar as we know Nature, Nature runs altogether the other way, the\nweaker does the presumption itself get to be ; and one might in course\nof time use up one's presumptive privileges in this way, even though\none started (as our anti-telepathists do) with as good a case as the great\ninduction of psychology that all our knowledge comes by the use of our\neyes and ears and other senses. And we must remember also that this\nundermining of the strength of a presumption by reiterated report of\nfacts to the contrary does not logically require that the facts in question\nshould all be well proved. A lot of rumours in the air against a busi\nness man's credit, though they might all be vague, and no one of them\namount to proof that he is unsound, would certainly weaken the\npresumption of his soundness. And all the more would they have\nthis effect if they formed what our lamented Gurney called a faggot\nand not a chain, that is, if they were independent of each other,\nand came from different quarters. Now our evidence for telepathy,\nweak and strong, taken just as it comes, forms a faggot and not a\nchain. No one item cites the content of another item as part of its\nown proof. But, taken together, the items have a certain general\nconsistency ; there is a method in their madness, so to speak. So each\nof them adds presumptive value to the lot ; and cumulatively, as no\ncandid mind can fail to see, they subtract presumptive force from the\northodox belief that there can be nothing in any one's intellect that\nhas not come in through ordinary experiences of sense.\nBut it is a miserable thing for a question of truth to be confined\nto mere presumption and counter-presumption, with no decisive\nthunderbolt of fact to clear the baffling darkness. And sooth to say,\nin talking so much of the merely presumption-weakening value of our\nrecords, I have been wilfully taking the point of view of the so-called\n\" rigorously scientific \" disbeliever, and making an ad hominem plea.\nMy own point of view is different. For me the thunderbolt has\nfallen, and the orthodox belief has not merely had its presumption\nweakened, but the truth itself of the belief is decisively overthrown.\nIf you will let me use the language of the professional logic-shop, a\nuniversal proposition can be made untrue by a particular instance. If\nyou wish to upset the law that all crows are black, you mustn't seek\nto show that no crows are ; it is enough if you prove one single crow\nto be white. My own white crow is Mrs. Piper. In the trances of\n\f6 President's Address.\nthis medium, I cannot resist the conviction that knowledge appears\nwhich she has never gained by the ordinary waking use of her eyes\nand ears and wits. What the source of this knowledge may be I\nknow not, and have not the glimmer of an explanatory suggestion to\nmake ; but from admitting the fact of such knowledge, I can see no\nescape. So when I turn to the rest of our evidence, ghosts and all, I\ncannot carry with me the irreversibly negative bias of the rigorously\nscientific mind, with its presumption as to what the true order of\nnature ought to be. I feel as if, though the evidence be flimsy in\nspots, it may nevertheless collectively carry heavy weight. The\nrigorously scientific mind may, in truth, easily overreach itself.\nScience means, first of all, a certain dispassionate method. To\nsuppose that it means a certain set of results that one should pin\none's faith upon and hug forever, is sadly to mistake its genius, and\ndegrades the scientific body to the status of a sect.\nBut I am devoting too many words to scientific logic, and too few\nto my review of our career. In the question of physical mediumship,\nwe have left matters as baffling as we found them, neither more nor\nless. For if, on the one hand, we have brought out new documents\nconcerning the physical miracles of Stainton Moses, on the other hand\nwe have, by the Hodgson-Davey experiments, and the Paladino\nepisode, very largely increased the probability that testimony based on\ncertain sorts of observation may be quite valueless as proof. Eusapia\nPaladino has been to us both a warning and an encouragement. An\nencouragement to pursue unwaveringly the rigorous method in such\nmatters from which our Proceedings have never departed, and a\nwarning against drawing any prompt inference whatever from things\nthat happen in the dark. The conclusions to which some of us had\nbeen hastily led on \" the island,\" melted away when, in Cambridge,\nthe opportunity for longer and more cunning observation was afforded.\nSome day, it is to be hoped, our Proceedings may be enabled to\npublish a complete study of this woman's life. Whatever were the\nupshot of such a study, few documents could be more instructive in\nall ways for psychical research.\nIt is pleasant to turn from phenomena of the dark-sitting and rat-\nhole type (with their tragi-comic suggestion that the whole order of\nnature might possibly be overturned in one's own head, by the way in\nwhich one imagined oneself, on a certain occasion, to be holding a\ntricky peasant woman's feet) to the \" calm air of delightful studies.\"\nAnd on the credit-side of our Society's account a heavy entry must\nnext be made in favour of that immense and patient collecting of\nmiscellaneous first-hand documents that alone has enabled Mr. Myers\nto develop his ideas about automatism and the subliminal self. In\n\fPresident's Address. 7\nMr. Myers' papers on these subjects we see, for the first time in the\nhistory of men's dealings with occult matters, the whole range of\nthem brought together, illustrated copiously with unpublished con\ntemporary data, and treated in a thoroughly scientific way. All\nconstructions in this field must be provisional, and it is as something\nprovisional that Mr. Myers offers us his attempt to put order into the\ntangle. But, thanks to his genius, we begin to see for the first time\nwhat a vast interlocked and graded system these phenomena, from\nthe rudest motor automatisms to the most startling sensory appari\ntion, form. Mr. Myers' methodical treatment of them by classes and\nseries is the first great step towards overcoming the distaste of\northodox science to look at them at all.\nBut our Proceedings contain still other veins of ore for future\nworking. Ghosts, for example, and disturbances in haunted houses.\nThese, whatever else may be said of them at present, are not without\nbearing on the common scientific presumption of which I have\nalready perhaps said too much. Of course, one is impressed by such\nnarratives after the mode in which one's impressibility is fashioned.\nI am not ashamed to confess that in my own case, although my\njudgment remains deliberately suspended, my feeling towards the way\nin which the phenomena of physical mediumship should be approached\nhas received from ghost and disturbance-stories a distinctly charitable\nlurch. Science may keep saying : \" such things are simply impossible;\"\nyet, so long as the stories multiply in different lands, and so few are\npositively explained away, it is bad method to ignore them. They\nshould at least accrete for future use. As I glance back at my\nreading of the past few years (reading accidental so far as these\nstories go, since I have never followed up the subject) ten cases\nimmediately rise to my mind. The Phelps-case at Andover,\nrecorded by one of the family, in McClure's Magazine for this month ;\na case in China, in Nevius's Demon Possession, published last year ;\nthe case in John Wesley's life ; the \" Amherst Mystery \" in Nova\nScotia, (New York, 1888); the case in Mr. Willis's house at Fitchburg,\nrecorded in The Atlantic Monthly for August, 1868 (XXII., 129) ; the\nTelfair-Mackie case, in Sharpe's History of Witchcraft in Scotland ;\nthe Morse case, in Upham's Salem Witchcraft ; the case recounted in\nthe introduction of W. v. Humboldt's Briefe an eine Freundin ; a\ncase in the Annales des Sciences Psychiques for last year (p. 86) ;\nthe case of the carpenter's shop at Swanland, near Hull, in our\nProceedings, Vol. VII., Part XX, pp. 383 \u2014 394. In all of\nthese, if memory doesn't deceive me, material objects are said to\nhave been witnessed by many persons moving through the air in\nbroad daylight. Often the objects were multitudinous\u2014in some cases\nthey were stones showered through windows and down-chimney.\n\f8 President's Address.\nMore than once it was noted that they fell gently and touched the\nground without shock. Apart from the exceptionality of the reputed\noccurrences, their mutual resemblances suggest a natural type,\nand I confess that until these records, or others like them, are\npositively explained away, I cannot feel (in spite of such vast amounts\nof detected fraud) as if the case against physical mediumship itself as a\nfreak of nature were definitively closed. But I admit that one man's\npsychological reaction cannot here be like unto another's ; and one\ngreat duty of our Society will be to pounce upon any future case of\nthis \" disturbance \" type, catch it while red-handed and nail it fast,\nwhatever its quality be.\nWe must accustom ourselves more and more to playing the role of\na meteorological bureau, be satisfied for many a year to go without\ndefinitive conclusions, confident that if we only keep alive and heap up\ndata, the natural types of them (if there are any) will surely crystal\nlize out ; whilst old material that is baffling will get settled as we\nproceed, through its analogy with new material that will come with\nthe baffling character removed.\nBut I must not weary your patience with the length of my dis\ncourse. One general reflection, however, I cannot help asking you to\nlet me indulge in before I close. It is relative to the influence\nof psychical research upon our attitude towards human history.\nAlthough, as I said before, Science taken in its essence should stand\nonly for a method, and not for any special beliefs, yet, as habitually\ntaken by its votaries, Science has come to be identified with a\ncertain fixed general belief, the belief that the deeper order of\nNature is mechanical exclusively, and that non-mechanical categories\nare irrational ways of conceiving and explaining even such a\nthing as human life. Now this mechanical rationalism, as one\nmay call it, makes, if it becomes one's only way of thinking,\na violent breach with the ways of thinking that have, until our\nown time, played the greatest part in human history. Religious\nthinking, ethical thinking, poetical thinking, teleological, emotional,\nsentimental thinking, what one might call the personal view of life\nto distinguish it from the impersonal and mechanical view, and the\nromantic view of life to distinguish it from the rationalistic view, have\nbeen, and even still are, outside of well-drilled scientific circles, the\ndominant forms of thought. But for mechanical rationalism, person\nality is an insubstantial illusion ; the chronic belief of mankind, that\nevents may happen for the sake of their personal significance, is an\nabomination ; and the notions of our grandfathers about oracles and\nomens, divinations and apparitions, miraculous changes of heart\nand wonders worked by inspired persons, answers to prayer and\n\fPresident's Address. 9\nprovidential leadings, are a fabric absolutely baseless, a mass of sheer\nuntruth. Now, of course, we must all admit that the excesses to\nwhich the romantic and personal view of Nature may lead, if wholly\nunchecked by impersonal rationalism, are direful. Central African\nMumbo-jumboism is one of unchecked romanticism's fruits. One\nought accordingly to sympathize with that abhorrence of romanticism\nas a sufficient world-theory ; one ought to understand that lively\nintolerance of the least grain of romanticism in the views of life of\n\u25a0other people, which are such characteristic.marks of those who follow\nthe scientific professions to-day. Our debt to Science is literally\nboundless, and our gratitude for what is positive in her teachings\nmust be correspondingly immense. But our own Proceedings and\nJournals have, it seems to me, conclusively proved one thing to the\n\u25a0candid reader, and that is that the verdict of pure insanity, of gratuitous\npreference for error, of superstition without an excuse, which the\nscientists of our day are led by their intellectual training to pro\nnounce upon the entire thought of the past, is a most shallow verdict.\nThe personal and romantic view of life has other roots beside wanton\n\u25a0exuberance of imagination and perversity of heart. It is perenially\nfed byfacts of experience, whatever the ulterior interpretation of those\nfacts may prove to be, and at no time in human history would it have\nbeen less easy than now\u2014at most times it would have been much more\n\u25a0easy\u2014for advocates with a little industry to collect in its favour an\narray of contemporary documents as good as those which our publica\ntions present. These documents all relate to real experiences of persons.\nThese experiences have three characters in common : they are capri\ncious, discontinuous, and not easily controlled ; they require peculiar\npersons for their production ; their significance seems to be wholly for\npersonal life. Those who preferentially attend to them, and still more\nthose who are individually subject to them, not only easily may find but\nare logically bound to find in them valid arguments for their romantic\nand personal conception of the world's course. Through my slight par\nticipation in the investigations of the Society for Psychical Research,\nI have become acquainted with numbers of persons of this sort, for\nwhom the very word Science has become a name of reproach, for reasons\nthat I now both understand and respect. It is the intolerance of\nScience for such phenomena as we are studying, her peremptory denial\neither of their existence, or of their significance except as proofs of man's\nabsolute innate folly, that has set Science so apart from the common\nsympathies of the race. I confess that it is on this, its humanizing\nmission, that our Society's best claim to the gratitude of our genera\ntion seems to me to depend. We have restored continuity to history.\nWe have shown some reasonable basis for the most superstitious aberra\ntions of the foretime. We have bridged the chasm, healed the hideous\n\f10 President's Address.\nrift that Science, taken in a certain narrow way, has shot into the\nhuman world.\nI will even go one step further. When from our present advanced\nstandpoint we look back upon the past stages of human thought,\nwhether it be scientific thought or theological thought, we are amazed\nthat a Universe which appears to us of so vast and mysterious a com\nplication should ever have seemed to any one so little and plain a.\nthing. Whether it be Descartes' world or Newton's ; whether it be\nthat of the materialists of the last century or that of the Bridgewater\ntreatises of our own ; it always looks the same to us\u2014incredibly per-\nspectiveless and short. Even Lyell's, Faraday's, Mill's, and Darwin's\nconsciousness of their respective subjects are already beginning to put\non an infantile and innocent look. Is it then likely that the Science of\nour own day will escape the common doom, that the minds of its\nvotaries will never look old-fashioned to the grandchildren of the\nlatter ? It would be folly to suppose so. Yet, if we are to judge by\nthe analogy of the past, when our Science once becomes old-fashioned,\nit will be more for its omissions of fact, for its ignorance of whole\nranges and orders of complexity in the phenomena to be explained,\nthan for any fatal lack in its spirit and principles. The spirit and prin\nciples of Science are mere affairs of method ; there is nothing in them\nthat need hinder Science from dealing successfully with a world in\nwhich personal forces are the starting-point of new effects. The only form\nof thing that we directly encounter, the only experience that we\nconcretely have, is our own personal life. The only complete category\nof our thinking, our professors of philosophy tell us, is the category\nof personality, every other category being one of the abstract elements\nof that. And this systematic denial on Science's part of personality as\na condition of events, this rigorous belief that in its own essential\nand innermost nature our world is a strictly impersonal world, may,\nconceivably, as the whirligig of time goes round, prove to be the\nvery defect that our descendants will be most surprised at in our\nown boasted Science, the omission that, to their eyes, will most\ntend to make it look perspectiveless and short.\nBut these things lie upon the knees of the gods. I must leave\nthem there, and close now this discourse, which I regret that I could\nnot make more short. If it has made you feel that (however it turn\nout with modern Science) our own Society, at any rate, is not \" per\nspectiveless,\" it will have amply served its purpose ; and the next\nPresident's address may have more definite conquests to record.\n\fSub-conscious Reasoning. 11\nII.\nSUB-CONSCIOUS REASONING.\nBy Wm. Romaine Newbold.\nThe three following cases may, perhaps, be as well reported\nunder the above somewhat ambiguous caption as under any other.\nIn all, the results obtruded upon the upper consciousness seem to\npre-suppose the existence of conscious states, which, in two cases,\nwould appear never to have existed in the upper consciousness at all,\nand in the third, even if they did exist, existed only in dream and\nwere wholly forgotten. Furthermore, the results were in all three\ncases of such a character that they could have been attained by\nprocesses of associative reasoning analogous to those of the upper\nconsciousness, and we are therefore not required to ascribe to the\nsupposititious \" subconscious \" states any supernormal powers.\nThe first was given me by my friend and colleague, William A.\nLamberton, Professor of Greek in the University of Pennsylvania,\nand I transcribe his own written statement.\n\" I went to the Lehigh University in the fall of 1869 as instructor\nin Latin and Greek. My spare time, however, partly as the result of\nold leanings of my undergraduate days, partly in consequence of a\nsomewhat intimate companionship that sprang up between me and the\ninstructor in mathematics, after a few months came to be given almost\nentirely to mathematics. I then made acquaintance for the first time\nwith the pleasures of descriptive geometry ; I may say here that this\nbranch of mathematics has a more direct tendency towards quickening\nthe power of mentally picturing bodies and lines in space than any\nother part of mathematics that can be called elementary. I mention\nthis here because it may have some bearing upon the experience now\nto be related.\n\" Outside of this study of descriptive geometry, my mathematical\nwork was entirely algebraic and analytic. I soon began to try my\nhand at certain problems. Somewhere in the spring, I think it was,\nof 1870, I attacked this problem :\u2014Given an ellipse, to find the locus\nof the foot of the perpendicular let fall from either focus upon a\ntangent to this ellipse at any point. I endeavoured to solve this\nanalytically, starting from the well-known equations of the tangent to\nan ellipse, and of a perpendicular to a given line from a given point.\n\f12 Wm. Romaine Newbold.\nNo thought of attempting a geometrical solution ever entered my\nhead. After battling with these equations for a considerable time\u2014it\nwas over a week and may have been two weeks\u2014I came to the natural\nconclusion that I was bogged, and that all my efforts, if continued,\nwould only sink me deeper in the bog ; the proper thing to do was to\ncall a halt, dismissing the problem as far as possible from my thoughts,\nand after some time, when my mind had got completely free from it, to\nreturn to it afresh, when, I had no doubt, a few minutes would put me\nin possession of the solution. This I did absolutely and with success.\nAfter about a week, I woke one morning and found myself in\npossession of the desired solution under circumstances to me strange\nand interesting, so much so that the impression of them has never died\naway, or even, so far as I can say, become dim or altered in any way.\nFirst :\u2014the solution was entirely geometrical, whereas I had been\nlabouring for it analytically without ever drawing or attempting to\ndraw a single figure. Second :\u2014it presented itself by means of a figure\nobjectively pictured at a considerable distance from me on the opposite\nwall. Now although I have been able, and have been so for years, to\npicture to myself a geometrical figure\u2014even moderately complicated\u2014\nand use it for solution of a geometrical problem without external lines\nbeing drawn, such figures have sensationally for me a distinct location\nin myself, viz., in the eye itself ; they are never, so far as I know,\nexternally presented. This, however, was distinctly external. The\nroom that I occupied had once been a recitation room. It was a long\nroom, running east and west, with two windows on the south side, one\nin the south-east corner. The north wall had once been partially\noccupied by a long blackboard, set in the wall and surrounded by a\nmoulding. The blackboard surface was simply a blackened\u2014possibly\nslated\u2014portion of the wall itself. This had been painted over, but the\nblack showed through the white paint and the moulding was still there;\nso that, apart from the tradition, with which I was familiar, the fact of\na blackboard having been there was perfectly clear and evident. My\nbed was so placed between the windows on the south and the north\nwall, that on opening my eyes in the morning the first thing I would\nbe likely to see was the blackboard surface. On opening my eyes on\nthe morning in question, I saw projected upon this blackboard surface\na complete figure, containing not only the lines given by the problem,\nbut also a number of auxiliary lines, and just such lines as without\nfurther thought solved the problem at once. Both foci were joined\nwith the point of contact of the tangent ; the perpendicular was\nprolonged beyond its point of intersection with the tangent till it\nmet the line from the other focus through the point of contact with\nthe ellipse ; a line was drawn from the centre of the ellipse to the\nfoot of the perpendicular, and, lastly, the locus, a circle on the major\n\fSub-conscious Reasoning. 13\naxis of the ellipse as diameter, was drawn. I sprang from bed and\ndrew the figure on paper ; needless to say, perhaps, that the geome\ntrical solution being thus given, only a few minutes were needed to\nget the analytical one.\nW. A. Lamberton.\"\nProfessor Lamberton has showed me his note-book containing the\nstatement of the problem and the analytical solution. He is unable\nto find the contemporary drawing above mentioned, and no con\ntemporary account is forthcoming. It is possible that some of the\ndetails of the phenomenon have become obscured in the lapse of\ntwenty-five years, but the essential points seem to me to be indubit\nable,\u2014that Professor Lamberton saw that morning an externalised\nhallucinatory figure, and that, whatever its precise character, it\nsuggested to him the solution which he had sought in vain by the\nanalytical method. There is no clue to the time at which the reason\ning processes necessary to attain the result were carried out, but from\ngeneral considerations it seems to me most probable that they formed\npart of some forgotten dream and were not going on \" sub\nconsciously \" during waking life. Professor Lamberton is of Scotch-\nIrish descent, is a man of the most robust physical and mental health,\nand is of a temperament precisely the opposite of that in which\ntraces of true \" sub-conscious \" processes are usually found. The\nfunction of the disused blackboard, as apparently providing a point\nde repere for the hallucination, is of interest and will suggest many\nanalogies. This is Professor Lamberton's only hallucinatory experience.\nHe informs me further that his colour memory is bad, although his\nmemory for line and form is excellent. He visualises little, and it\nwas not until some time after the above experience that he learned that\nit was within the power of some persons voluntarily to externalise\ntheir visual memories.\nFor the other two cases I am indebted to another friend and\ncolleague, Dr. Herman V. Hilprecht, Professor of Assyrian in the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania. Both occurred in his own experience,\nand I write the account of the first from notes made by me upon his\nnarrative.\nDuring the winter, 1882\u20141883, he was working with Professor\nFriedrich Delitzsch, and was preparing to publish, as his dissertation,\na text, transliteration and translation of a stone of Nebuchadnezzar 1.\nwith notes. He accepted at that time the explanation given by\nProfessor Delitzsch of the name Nebuchadnezzar\u2014\" Nahu-kud&rru-\nusur,\" \"Nebo protect my mason's pad, or mortar board,\" i.e., \"my work\nas a builder.\" One night, after working late, he went to bed about\ntwo o'clock in the morning. After a somewhat restless sleep, he awoke\n\f14 Wm. Romaine Newbold.\nwith his mind full of the thought that the name should be translated\n\" Nebo protect my boundary.\" He had a dim consciousness of having\nbeen working at his table in a dream, but could never recall the details\nof the process by which he arrived at this conclusion. Reflecting upon\nit when awake, however, he at once saw that kudurru, \" boundary \",\ncould be derived from the verb kaddru, to enclose. Shortly afterwards\nhe published this translation in his dissertation, and it has since been\nuniversally adopted.\nI quote this experience, in itself of a familiar type, on account of\nits interest when viewed in connection with the more curious dream\nnext to be related. I was told of the latter shortly after it happened,\nand here translate an account written in German by Professor\nHilprecht, August 8th, 1893, before the more complete confirmation\nwas received.\n\"One Saturday evening about the middle of March, 1893, I had\nbeen wearying myself, as I had done so often in the weeks preceding,\nin the vain attempt to decipher two small fragments of agate which\nwere supposed to belong to the finger rings of some Babylonian. The\nlabour was much increased by the fact that the fragments presented\nremnants only of characters and lines, that dozens of similar small\nfragments had been found in the ruins of the temple of Bel at Nippur\nwith which nothing could be done, that in this case furthermore I had\nnever had the originals before me, but only a hasty sketch made by one\nof the members of the expedition sent by the University of Pennsyl\nvania to Babylonia. I could not say more than that the fragments,\ntaking into consideration the place in which they were found and the\npeculiar characteristics of the cuneiform characters preserved upon\nthem, sprang from the Cassite period of Babylonian history (ca. 1700-\n1140 B.C.) ; moreover, as the first character of the third line of the first\nfragment seemed to be KTJ, I ascribed this fragment, with an\ninterrogation point, to King Kurigalzu, while I placed the other\nfragment, as unclassifiable, with other Cassite fragments upon a page\nof my book where I published the unclassifiable fragments. The\nproofs already lay before me, but I was far from satisfied. The whole\nproblem passed yet again through my mind that March evening before\nI placed my mark of approval under the last correction in the book.\nEven then I had come to no conclusion. About midnight, weary and\nexhausted, I went to bed and was soon in deep sleep. Then I dreamed\nthe following remarkable dream. A tall, thin priest of the old pre-\nchristian Nippur, about forty years of age and clad in a simple\nabba, led me to the treasure chamber of the temple, on its south-east\nside. He went with me into a small, low-ceiled room without windows,\nin which there was a large wooden chest, while scraps of agate and lapis\nlazuli lay scattered on the floor. Here he addressed me as follows :\u2014\n\fSub-conscious Reasoning. 15\n* The two fragments which you have published separately upon pages\n22 and 26, belong together, are not finger rings, and their history\nis as follows. King Kurigalzu (ca. 1300 B.C.) once sent to the temple\nof Bel, among other articles of agate and lapis lazuli, an inscribed\nvotive cylinder of agate. Then we priests suddenly received the\ncommand to make for the statue of the god Ninib a pair of earrings of\nagate. We were in great dismay, since there was no agate as raw\nmaterial at hand. In order to execute the command there was nothing\nfor us to do but cut the votive cylinder into three parts, thus making\nthree rings, each of which contained a portion of the original inscrip\ntion. The first two rings served as earrings for the statue of the god ;\nthe two fragments which have given you so much trouble are portions\nof them. If you will put the two together you will have confirmation\nof my words. But the third ring you have not yet found in the course\nof your excavations and you never will find it.' With this, the priest\ndisappeared. I awoke at once and immediately told my wife the dream\nthat I might not forget it. Next morning\u2014Sunday\u2014I examined the\nfragments once more in the light of these disclosures, and to my\nastonishment found all the details of the dream precisely verified in so\nfar as the means of verification were in my hands. The original\ninscription on the votive cylinder read :\u2014' To the god Ninib, son of\nBel, his lord, has Kurigalzu, pontifex of Bel, presented this.'\n\" The problem was thus at last solved. I stated in the preface that\nI had unfortunately discovered too late that the two fragments\nbelonged together, made the corresponding changes in the ' Table of\nContents,' pp. 50 and 52, and, it being not possible to transpose the\nfragments, as the plates were already made, I put in each plate a brief\nreference to the other. (Cf. Hilprecht, ' The Babylonian Expedition\nof the University of Pennsylvania,' Series A, Cuneiform Texts, Vol.\nI., Part 1, ' Old Babylonian Inscriptions, chiefly from Nippur.')\n\" H. V. Hilprecht.\"\nUpon the priest's statement that the fragments were those of a\nvotive cylinder, Professor Hilprecht makes the following comment :\u2014\n\" There are not many of these votive cylinders. I had seen, all\ntold, up to that evening, not more than two. They very much\nresemble the so-called seal cylinders, but usually have no pictorial\nrepresentations upon them, and the inscription is not reversed, not\nbeing intended for use in sealing, but is written as it is read.\"\nThe following transliteration of the inscription, in the Sumerian\nlanguage, will serve to give those of us who are unlearned in cunei\nform languages an idea of the material which suggested the dream.\nThe straight vertical lines represent the cuts by which the stone-cutter\ndivided the original cylinder into three sections. The bracketted\n\f16 Wm. Romaine Neivbold.\nwords are entirely lost, and have been supplied by analogy from tbe\nmany similar inscriptions.\nLine 1.

(in- na- ba) has presented it.\nI translate also the following statement which Mrs. Hilprecht kindly\nmade at my request.\n\" I was wakened from sleep by a sigh, immediately thereafter heard\na spring from the bed, and at the same moment saw Professor\nHilprecht hurrying into his study. Thence came the cry ' It is so, it\nis so.' Grasping the situation, I followed him and satisfied myself in\nthe midnight hour as to the outcome of his most interesting dream.1\n\"J. C. Hilprecht.\"\nAt the time Professor Hilprecht told me of this curious dream,\nwhich was a few weeks after its occurrence, there remained a serious\ndifficulty which he was not able to explain. According to the memo\nranda in our possession, the fragments were of different colours, and\ntherefore could have scarcely belonged to the same object. The original\nfragments were in Constantinople, and it was with no little interest\nthat I awaited Professor Hilprecht's return from the trip which be\nmade thither in the summer of 1893. I translate again his own\naccount of what he then ascertained.\n\" In August, 1893, I was sent by the Committee on the Babylonian\nExpedition to Constantinople, to catalogue and study the objects\ngot from Nippur and preserved there in the Imperial Museum. It\nwas to me a matter of the greatest interest to see for myself the\nobjects which, according to my dream, belonged together, in order to\nsatisfy myself that they had both originally been parts of the same\nvotive cylinder. Halil Bey, the director of the museum, to-\nwhom I told my dream, and of whom I asked permission to-\nsee the objects, was so interested in the matter, that he at\n1 An apparent discrepancy between Professor Hilprecht's account and that of\nMrs. Hilprecht calls for explanation. Professor Hilprecht states that he verified his\ndream on Sunday morning at the University ; Mrs. Hilprecht that he verified it\nimmediately upon awaking, in his library. Both statements are correct. He had a.\nworking copy in his library which he examined at once, but hurried to the University\nnext morning to verify it by comparison with the authorised copy made from the\noriginals.\u2014W.R.N.\n\fSub-conscious Reasoning. 17\nonce opened all the cases of the Babylonian section, and requested\nme to search. Father Scheil, an Assyriologist from Paris, who\nhad examined and arranged the articles excavated by us before\nme, had not recognised the fact that these fragments belonged\ntogether, and consequently I found one fragment in one case, and the\nother in a case far away from it. As soon as I found the fragments\nand put them together, the truth of the dream was demonstrated ad\noculos\u2014they had, in fact, once belonged to one and the same votive\ncylinder. As it had been originally of finely veined agate, the stone\ncutter's saw had accidentally divided the object in such a way that\nthe whitish vein of the stone appeared only upon the one fragment\nand the larger grey surface upon the other. Thus I was able to\nexplain Dr. Peters' discordant descriptions of the two fragments.\u2014\nNovember 10th, 1895.\"\nProfessor Hilprecht is unable to say what language the old priest\nused in addressing him. He is quite certain that it was not Assyrian,\nand thinks it was either English or German.\nThere are two especial points of interest in this case, the character\nof the information conveyed, and the dramatic form in which it was\nput. The apparently novel points of information given were :\u2014\n1. That the fragments belonged together.\n2. That they were fragments of a votive cylinder.\n3. That the cylinder was presented by King Kurigalzu.\n4. That it was dedicated to Ninib.\n5. That it had been made into a pair of earrings.\n6. That the \" treasure chamber \" was located upon the south-east\nside of the temple.\nA careful analysis reveals the fact that not one of these items was\nbeyond the reach of the processes of associative reasoning which Pro\nfessor Hilprecht daily employs. Among the possible associative conse\nquents of the writing upon the one fragment, some of the associative\nconsequents of the writing on the other were sub-consciously involved ;\nthe attraction of these identical elements brings the separate pieces into\nmental juxtaposition, precisely as the pieces of a \" dissected map \" find\none another in thought. In waking life the dissimilarity of colour\ninhibited any tendency on the part of the associative processes to bring\nthem together, but in sleep this difference of colour seems to have been\nforgotten\u2014there being no mention made of it\u2014and the assimilation\ntook place. The second point is more curious, but is not inexplicable.\nFor as soon as the fragments were brought into juxtaposition mentally,\nenough of the inscription became legible to suggest the original\ncharacter of the object. This is true also of the third and fourth points.\nThe source of the fifth is not so clear. Upon examining the originals,\nc\n\f18 Wm. Rontaine Newbold.\nProfessor Hilprecht felt convinced from the size of the hole still to\nbe seen through the fragments that they could not have been used as\nfinger-rings, and that they had been used as earrings, but the written\ndescription which he had before him at the time of his dream did not\nbring these points to view. Still, such earrings are by no means\nuncommon objects. Such a supposition might well have occurred to\nProfessor Hilprecht in his waking state and, in view of the lack of\npositive confirmation, it would be rash to ascribe it to any supernormal\npower. The last point is most interesting. When he told me this\nstory, Professor Hilprecht remembered that he had heard from Dr.\nJohn P. Peters, before he had the dream, of the discovery of a room\nin which were remnants of a wooden box, while the floor was strewn\nwith fragments of agate and lapis lazuli. The walls, of course, and\nceiling have long since perished. The location, however, of the room\nhe did not know, and suggested I should write to Dr. Peters and find\nout whether it was correctly given in his dream, and whether Dr.\nPeters had told him of it. Dr. Peters replied that the location given\nwas correct, but, he adds, he told Professor Hilprecht all these facts as\nlong ago as 1891, and thinks he provided him with a drawing of the\nroom's relation to the temple. Of this Professor Hilprecht has no\nrecollection. He thinks it probable that Dr. Peters told him orally of\nthe location of the room, but feels sure that if any such plan was given\nhim it would now be found among his papers. This is a point of no\nimportance, however. \"We certainly cannot regard the location as\nascertained by supernormal means.\nThe dramatic form of the dream is of greater interest ; yet, strange\nas it is, it is not without numerous analogues in the literature of\ndreams. M. Maury gives two cases from his own experience which\nare almost exactly parallel. \" Recently the name Mussidan came\nsuddenly to mind ; I knew at the time that it was the name of a town\nin France, but where it was I did not know, or, better, I had forgotten.\nSome while afterwards I saw in a dream a certain individual\nwho told me he came from Mussidan ; I asked him where that town\nwas. He replied that it was a place of importance in a canton of the\ndepartment of the Dordogne. At the end of the dream I awoke ; it\nwas morning ; I remembered the dream perfectly, but was in doubt as\nto the accuracy of what my individual had told me. The name\nMussidan still presented itself to mind under the conditions of the\npreceding days, that is to say, I did not know where the town so termed\nwas situated. I made haste to consult a geographical dictionary and,\nto my great surprise, discovered that the interlocutor of my dream\nknew more geography than I ; in other words, that I had recalled in\ndream a fact which I had forgotten in the waking state, and that I had\nput into the mouth of another what was but a recollection of my own.\n\fSub-conscious Reasoning. 19\nSome years ago, while studying English and especially endeavouring to\nlearn the meanings of verbs followed by prepositions, I had the\nfollowing dream. I was talking English, and, desiring to tell a person\nthat I had paid him a call the preceding day, I made use of this\nexpression, ' I called for you yesterday.' ' That's badly put,' he\nreplied ; ' you should say, I called on you yesterday.' Next morning,\non waking, the recollection of this incident of my dream was very\ndistinct. I took a grammar lying on a table near my bed and verified\nit ; the imaginary individual was right.\" (Le Sommeil et les Reves,\n142-3).\nIn these cases it is possible that the apparently foreign items of\ninformation were really accidental elements, drawn into the course of\na dream which had been originated in some other way. But the case\nnarrated by Professor Hilprecht is somewhat different. Here we are\nforced, I think, to assume that the logical processes had been approxi\nmately completed before the dramatic form was assumed. In the\ndramatic form itself there is nothing that presents any particular diffi\nculty. All the associative material out of which it was constructed was\nmore or less in mind, and such a dream might easily have been initiated\nby many slight causes. But if we assume that the conclusion was\nreached before the old priest, with so much ceremony, inducted the\ndreamer into a secret which he already knew, we fall into further\ntrouble. It is upon such phenomena as these that some would base\nthe conception of a sub-conscious self, who is at all times ready and\nanxious to make use of his supernormal powers to play practical jokes\nof a peculiarly mystifying, if usually kindly character, upon the more\nstupid upper self. According to this doctrine, Professor Hilprecht's\nsub-conscious self, having solved the problem by methods more or less\nunknown to us, deliberately resolved to present the result to Professor\nHilprecht in the form of an instructive drama, with thoughts to serve\nas its puppets.\nIn this case, at least, I can see no reason for resort to such a\nconception. We have evidence amply sufficient to show that, at least\nin dreams which take their rise from sensory suggestions, the apparent\nflow of the dream-time may be precisely the opposite of that of real\ntime. In other words, the dream may be dramatised backwards, so\nto speak, from its apparent conclusion to its apparent initiation. Thus\nwhen M. Maury, while tickled with a feather, dreamed that he was\nbeing tortured by having the skin of his face torn off by a mask of\nhot pitch, it is probable that some notion of the mask and its applica-\ncation preceded the sensation of pain ; although, in fact, the touch\nsensation, of which the latter was the exaggerated representation, came\nfirst in real time. A clearer case is that related upon page 161 (op.\ncit.) A long dream of the Reign of Terror concluded with his arrest, trial,\nc 2\n\f20 Wm. Romaine Newbold.\nconviction ; he clearly remembered all the details of his transportation\nin a tumbril to the place of execution, how he was bound to the fatal\nplank, how the knife fell,\u2014and with the blow he awoke to find that the\ncurtain-pole of his bed had fallen and struck him a severe blow on the\nback of the neck. His mother, who was in the room, said that he\nawoke the instant it fell. Here we must suppose that the dream time\nwas purely illusory and occupied only a fragment of a second of real\ntime. A similar case was narrated by a friend of mine. She had\nbeen very ill with typhoid fever but was convalescent ; she had fallen\ninto a light doze in her chair and dreamed that she was being pursued\nfrom room to room by a savage dog. She would enter a room, close\nthe door, hold it against him, he would make his appearance by another\ndoor and she would escape through the one she was holding and take\nflight to another room. This lasted, she thought, for a half-hour or so.\nShe had been driven to the third storey and had taken refuge in a\nsmall room with but one door. That door she held against the dog's\npressure until her feeble strength gave way, the brute sprang upon her\nwith a howl,\u2014and she awoke with a start to find that her sister had at\nthat moment placed her hand upon her arm and had said \" Boo.\" The\ncharacter of this dream precludes, I think, the supposition that the\n\" Boo \" was merely accidentally woven into the texture of a dream\nalready in course of progress ; it must have been the generating\nsuggestion from which the whole dream took rise.\nProfessor Hilprecht's dream may be interpreted in the same way.\nUndoubtedly the old priest's statements were attained by normal\nprocesses of associative reasoning which Professor Hilprecht has now\nforgotten, and upon them, as upon a logical core, the dream imagery\nhas been superimposed, thus producing a time-hallucination.\n\fSuggestion without Hypnotism. 21\nIII.\nSUGGESTION WITHOUT HYPNOTISM,\nAn Account of Experiments in Preventing or Suppressing Pain.1\nBy C. M. Barrows.\nI have been asked to present a report of experiments made by\nmyself in the use of suggestion without hypnotism. The work was\nbegun about seven years ago, and in prosecuting it I have treated\nseveral hundred persons, afflicted with various maladies, including\ninsomnia, rheumatism, neuralgia, intermittent headache, sore joints,\nhysteria, chorea, morbid phenomena left as the result of disease,\nfunctional disorders of the nervous system, dipsomania, stammering,\nstage-fright, excessive emotion, etc. ;\u2014affording in one sense an\nattractive variety.\nOut of this list, I have chosen for mention in this paper cases in\nwhich pain in some form was either prevented or suppressed under\nconditions of nerve and tissue that would ordinarily make it\ninevitable. Such cases are better suited to the present purpose than\nthe others, because in weighing the evidence they offer, there is\ncomparatively little danger of errors due to either of the two causes\nwhich Professor Richet tells us it suffices to eliminate. Intentional\nfraud can scarcely be supposed to enter into these experiments, and\neven the liability to \" unconscious \" or \" automatic \" fraud is slight.\nChance, too, \" which often brings about amazing coincidences,\" can by\nno stretch of its big cloak be made to cover the whole group.\nTake toothache, for example, the kind of pain with which I first\nattempted to deal. If I had tried only a few cases, or if only now\nand then the pain had disappeared under the treatment, common sense\nwould insist that the ache ceased by chance. But since the record\nshows a large number of such treatments, with no failures among\nthem, it seems reasonable to conclude that the suggestion stopped the\npain. And yet, on the strength of these results alone, I would not\ndare to affirm that what occurred in even a single case was an instance\nof cause and effect. Fortunately I am able to cite more decisive tests\nof the power of the agency employed.\n1 Read at the General Meeting of the Society held in the Westminster Town\nHall, January 31st, 1896 ; also at the meetings of the American Branch held in\nBoston and New York, December, 1895.\n\f22 C. M. Barrows.\nA lady about to have several very sensitive teeth filled, asked if\nsuggestion would exempt her from the torture in store for her. She\nexplained that in all her experience of dental operations, the process\nhad been extremely painful, and the shock brought on nervous\nprostration. Of course, I could promise nothing as to the result, but\ninvited her to try it. Her dentist had his office in Boston, and on the\nday of her first appointment with him, she appeared at my house in\nBrookline at nine o'clock in the morning. I explained the nature and\nmanner of the treatment as well as I could, and made the suggestion\nthat she should feel no pain while in the dentist's chair that day, and\nno nervous prostration should ensue.\nThe lady left me, feeling, as I judged, very little confidence in\nwhat I had done,\u2014indeed, she remarked that she could not see that\nI had done anything,\u2014and at eleven o'clock the operator began work\non her most sensitive tooth. Finding, to his surprise as well as her\nown, that she did not wince under the rough touch of his instruments,\nhe worked steadily and fast for two hours, before she was released from\nthe chair. The next day, instead of being miserable in bed, this lady\ncalled to report to me what seemed to her a wonderful deliverance\nfrom pain. Referring to the molar on which the dentist had spent so\nmuch time, she said, \" Dr. wanted to fill it a year ago, but it\nhurt so I could not bear to let him touch it ; but yesterday he did\nnot hurt me a particle, although he worked fast and did not favour\nme. I felt every movement and realised all he was doing, but there\nwas no pain at all, and I have no prostration.\"\nThis patient had four subsequent appointments to keep with her\ndentist ; and as the days arrived for the second, third, and fourth, I\nrepeated the suggestion made in the first instance, and she passed the\nordeal with a like immunity from suffering and exhaustion. Perhaps\nthe continued successes made me over-confident ; for when she called\nto take the fifth and last treatment, she was late, I was pressed for\ntime, and so omitted the formal suggestion, trusting that I should be\nable to control her sensations when there should be need of it. But\nin this I reckoned without my host, and a wretched failure was the\nconsequence. The poor victim endured severe torture, and was kept in\nbed for two days by the prostration. This mistake is not to be\naccounted an unmixed evil, however, since no one would deny that it\nlent an added value to the experiment.\nIt should be understood, of course, that in every dental case herein\ndescribed, my treatment began and ended with a single suggestion. I\ndid not accompany the patient to the office, or continue the treatment\nafter the patient had departed. Observe also that each suggestion\nmade was a post-suggestion ; that is to say, it was not intended to take\nimmediate effect, but to produce a specific result at a designated later\n\fSuggestion without Hypnotism. 23\nhour. like post-hypnotic suggestion, it seemed to become available at\nthe particular time intended when it was made, and to have no\ninfluence before the appointed hour or after it had expired. A boy\nwho was treated to have a tooth extracted in the forenoon, finding that\nit had ceased to ache, postponed the operation until afternoon, and then\nfound that the suggestion did him no good. Another case illustrating\nthe same point is that of a young lady pianist of much talent, who\nduring her first public performances was so overcome by stage-fright\nthat she failed to do herself justice. One evening, when she was to\nplay at a public entertainment, I made the suggestion that she should\nbe perfectly at her ease, and the experiment succeeded, to her great\ndelight. Subsequently I rendered her a like service ; but owing to a\nchange in the programme, she did not take her part as expected, but\ndid play at a repetition of the performance given a day later ; but the\nvirtue of my suggestion was gone. It is a pleasure to add that a few\nmore treatments permanently cured this young lady of her annoying\nattacks of fright.\nTo be able to rob the dentist's chair of any part of its terrors is\nindeed a gratifying achievement, but it is not after all the crucial test.\nThe crowning triumph would be to enable a person by means of\nsuggestion alone to have firm teeth extracted without pain. I am not\nprepared to say to what extent this can be done, for I have tried the\nexperiment only seven times, and in one instance it was a failure. Four\nof the seven trials were made on children between the ages of eight and\nfifteen years, each of whom had a firm molar removed. The next trial\nI can refer to with confidence, because it was my own teeth that were\nextracted. I parted with two molars, one of which was a firm one\nwith hooked roots, and the dentist used two different instruments\nbefore he succeeded in removing the whole. This was a case of\nauto-suggestion, and the operation, though prolonged, was absolutely\npainless. Two women took my treatment on the same day for a like\npurpose. One of them had four firm teeth and three loose ones taken\nout, and found that my suggestion did not help her at all ; the other\nlady parted with a firm molar and pronounced the treatment a\nsuccess.\nA large number of test cases would be necessary to establish the\npractical usefulness of this form of inhibition ; but as instances of\nlocal analgesia induced without hypnotism, the six successful experi\nments are of peculiar interest, because the operation of extracting a\nfirm tooth is severe while it lasts, and the snapping of live nerves is\npainful. It would not be easy to choose six experiments of the same\nkind, in which the conditions of a decisive test would be more fully\nmet : the patients were in a normal condition at the time of treatment ;\neach must have suffered during the operation, unless the pain had been\n\f24 G. M. Barrows.\nprevented in some way ; it was averted beyond a doubt ; and this\nresult could not reasonably be attributed to anything else than the\npsychical suggestion previously given.\nIn all cases of suggestion mentioned in this paper the mode of\nadministration was essentially the same. When dealing with persons to\nwhom it is new, I usually explain that the purpose of it is to render\nthe nerves involved incapable for the time being of producing the\nsensation of pain. There is no hypnotism about this form of suggestion,\nno mesmerism, no animal-magnetism, no mind-cure. The effect does\nnot interfere in any way with the freedom of the patient ; for I work\nno charm and cast no spell upon him, exert no control over his will,\nmake no change in his thinking. My wish is to accomplish one\ndefinite result and nothing else, namely, to take away the feeling of pain\nfrom the consciousness which might otherwise suffer. If the patient is\nsceptical, I tell him that his doubt or faith will not alter the result,\nsince it is not a matter of opinion, but of sensation. Confidence in the\ntreatment is not necessary, nor will any attempt to resist vitiate the\neffect.\nHaving thus assured the patient and put him at his ease, I ask him\nto seat himself in a comfortable position, be quiet a few minutes, and\nthink of anything he pleases, while I suggest to his nerves how to\nbehave. Sometimes I show a patient what nerves are producing the\nsensation of pain and locate the centres by placing my hand on his\nhead. Some action of this sort is often useful with children, as a\ntangible evidence to them that something is being done.\nThe popular impression (and this is not untrue) is that hypnotic\nsuggestion is administered orally, in a language the patient under-\n'stands. When the patient is asleep and has reached a favourable\nstage of the trance, Dr. Liebeault or Dr. Bernheim says in a distinct\ntone of voice: \"You will feel no pain when you awake\"; or, \"The\nlameness you complain of will be gone,\" or whatever utterance the case\ncalls for. It is not claimed, I suppose, that the suggestions made in\nthis way differ in kind from those a mother might make to her child\nwho is hurt, when she says : \" You will feel better in a moment ' ; or,\n\" Mother will kiss it and make it well.\" In other words, the value of\nhypnotic suggestions made for therapeutic purposes does not consist in\nanything peculiar about them, but their effectiveness is due to the\nheightened susceptibility of the patient during the trance. It is\ndoubtful if this sort of treatment would have much effect upon disease\nand pain if the patients receiving it were not in a trance ; and because\nmy patients are not so affected, as far as I can judge, at the time of\ntreatment, I suspect that my suggestion is a different thing from that\nemployed by the hypnotisers ; not so much in its results on patients,\nbut as a psychical act of the operator.\n\fSuggestion without Hypnotism. 25\nMine is a silent suggestion. I use neither voice nor other means\nto convey its import to the patient through sensory adits. I find it\npossible to affect with these unvoiced suggestions one who does not\nknow my language, infants who have learned no language, and brute\ncreatures. This would not be the case if communication depended on\nspeech. More than this : I am not conscious of forming any statement\nof the message, even in thought, when I make the suggestion. I\ncertainly am not then thinking about my patient, or at him. Using the\nterm \" mind \" in the popular sense, it does not seem that the sugges\ntions which I make are addressed to it at all.\nMy experience in sending telepathic messages to distant percipients\ncasts some light upon this point. Whenever, acting as agent, I con\ncentrated my thought on a formal statement of the message, the\npercipient failed to receive it ; but when I made no thought effort,\u2014\nno conscious effort of any kind,\u2014the message reached its destination.\nMark, this is not saying that the agent does not need to think of his\nmessage beforehand and decide upon its content ; in all except purely\nspontaneous communications this preliminary step must be necessary.\nIn some recent experiments made with a reputed \"mind-reader,\" I found\nthat success did not depend on my own thought being kept steadily\nfixed on the thing he was to do. Indeed, I have much reason to\nbelieve that he did not read my thoughts at all. The conclusion seems\nwell nigh irresistible that therapeutic suggestion, as I use it, is not\nsensory but telepathic, that the communication does not require an\nact of thinking or willing to send it forth.\nAbout a year ago an Irish girl of seventeen came to me to be\ntreated for neuralgia in the left temple. She looked like an over\nworked, under-fed person, grown quite nervous from pain and loss of\nsleep. The pain and soreness were gone after the first treatment ; but\nthere was some return of the trouble next day, and I repeated the\nsuggestion on that and the following day, producing permanent relief.\nLast September I treated a Welshman, about forty years of\nage, who had been suffering from neuralgia for a long while, which\naffected the entire left side of his head and face. His ear had not\nbeen free from pain for two years, and he had several attacks daily\nof what he described as sharp stabs of pain. Within three weeks\nof the time I first saw the man, he had been complaining of his left\neye, which he said pained him constantly. The eye was much inflamed,\nbut it seemed to be only the orbit which was attacked, and after three\ntreatments both eye and orbit were cured. After that, I was unable\nto see the man again until two weeks later, when I found the eye\nall right, but the pain in and about the ear had not abated. I then\ngave him three treatments, and since that time he has had no neuralgic\nsymptoms at all.\n\f26 G. M. Barrows.\nAbout six years ago I treated a school teacher for neuralgia, and I\nthink this was my first experiment with this disease. She had borne\nthe pain for nearly two weeks, and her nerves were completely un\nstrung. I remember that I made the suggestion in a hesitating way,\nscarcely expecting the aching nerves to obey it ; but the pain stopped\nin a few minutes, and the treatment was followed by a night of refresh\ning sleep. This respite was only temporary, and next morning the\nlady was as bad as ever. She sent for me about the middle of the\nforenoon, and I gave her a second treatment, after which she suffered\nno more for twelve hours. Again, at ten o'clock in the evening, I was\nsummoned to repeat the suggestion ; and from that time on pain\nceased and the patient recovered.\nI am often asked whether the psychical treatment which relieves\npain also cures the disease or hurt which occasions the pain. Evidently\nit does not do so in all cases, although in every instance of rheumatism\nor neuralgia which I have treated, the suppression of the pain insured\nthe disappearance of the other symptoms. As exceptions to this rule,\nit may be mentioned that I once suppressed the pain of a big carbuncle\non the back of a man's neck for three successive nights, so that he got\nseveral hours of sleep ; but the ache began again each morning,\u2014pro\nbably awoke him,\u2014the suppurative process continued, and at the\nproper time the surgeon applied his knife. At another time I treated a\nman who suffered for months with a kidney trouble, which finally proved\nfatal. During the progress of the disease he was subject to spasmodic\nattacks with excruciating pain, and it was in one of these that I saw\nhim, and was able to relieve his distress. In several instances of a like\nnature, I have suppressed pain for the time being, thus affording the\npatient a brief respite from suffering.\nAnother interesting fact in this connection is that pain may be\npermanently inhibited in one part of the body, and at the same time\npersist in another part. In October, 1894, I treated a man who had\nsprained his left ankle very badly about a year and a half before.\nAlthough the foot was no longer lame, and it did not hurt him to use\nit, there remained a constant pain just under the outer malleolus,\nwhich when the foot became tired at night was very severe. At the\ntime this man came to me for help, he had been enduring this steady\npain for more than twelve months, and his nervous system\u2014naturally\na strong one\u2014was breaking down under the prolonged strain. This\ncase required a series of treatments, the record of which in my note\nbook is as follows : Treatment began October 9th, and repeated on\nthe 10th and 11th, with no apparent effect. On the 13th, pain ceased\nduring treatment, but returned after two hours. On the 16th, pain\nceased during treatment, but returned in one hour. On the 18th, the\npain shifted during treatment to the nerve in front of the tendon of\n\fSuggestion without Hypnotism. 27\nAchilles, and returned to the original spot about two hours later.\nOn the 19th, no treatment was given, but the man strained the foot\nbadly in jumping out of a carriage. This brought on a severe pain\nwhich lasted until late in the evening, when it stopped, and he felt a\nlike pain under the outer malleolus of his right foot, which did not\nsubside until near midnight. The next treatment was given on the\n20th, when the pain ceased and did not return ; and now, for a con\ntinuous period of more than a year, he has been wholly free from\nit. All the while he was under treatment, this man was suffering\nwith a painful lameness of the right arm, of which he made no men\ntion at the time. Six months after the ankle was cured, I tried to\nhelp the arm by suggestion, but could produce no permanent effect\nupon it. The man has followed for more than thirty years a mechani\ncal business which requires him to hold the right arm all day long\nin a cramped, unnatural position, in order to do his work, and to this\nfact the morbid condition is probably due.\nAbout the middle of February, 1895, a poor working-woman showed\nme the \" thimble \" finger of her right hand, the second joint of which\nwas pinched between two swinging doors, in 1886, and the ligaments\nbroken down. It received no surgical attention at the time of the\naccident, and for nine years it had been painful most of the time. I\ngave the case one suggestion and a permanent cure resulted ; but at\nthe same time this woman had a painful lameness of the neck, a\nconsequence of the grippe, which it required three subsequent treat\nments to remove.\nIn the spring of 1894, a young married lady asked to be treated for\nan intercostal pain which was peculiarly troublesome, and for which she\nsaid the doctors had no name or remedy. Three years before she\napplied to me, she was driving a pair of spirited horses which her\nhusband had just given her, when they took fright and ran. She\npulled on the reins with all her might, and while so doing felt something\ngive way in her right side, between the six and seventh ribs, as nearly\nas she could locate the hurt. After a week or two the soreness passed\noff; but she could not wear a close-fitting garment without bringing on\na hard pain, which grew more intense as long as the pressure continued.\nShe had consulted the best surgeons to be found in this country and in\nEurope without getting any help, and there seemed to be no escape\nfrom the annoying pain as long as she dressed in a way to be present\nable in society. I gave the case six treatments by suggestion, and the\npain entirely disappeared.\nBut I must not forget how soon descriptions of this kind become\ntiresome to the listener. Suffer me, then, to refer briefly to one other\nclass of cases, and have done with them. Rheumatic pains afford an\nalmost inexhaustible supply of cases for experiment, and I have had\n\f28 C. M. Barrows.\nmy share of them. Persons suffering in this way usually try the various\nmedicinal remedies, and if these afford no relief, and they get desperate\nenough to do anything, they will submit to suggestion. My experience\nwith rheumatism has been that, with few exceptions, from one to four\ntreatments put a stop to the pain ; but I can never be quite sure where\nthe credit of such cures belongs, since, as the doctors kindly remind\nme, the patients have just \" taken a great deal of good medicine.\" It\nwill suffice, perhaps, to cite two cases as samples of the rest.\nIn the latter part of January, 1892, a business man, then living on\nWest Chester Park, Boston, desired me to treat him. He had\nrheumatism in his shoulder and arm ; the pain had been very severe\nfor several days, the usual medicinal remedies failed to reach the case,\nand when I answered the call, which was in the early evening, he told\nme he \" was in for a terrible night,\" and if I could help him, he wished\nby all that was good that I would set about it. I made such a\nsuggestion as the case required, and left him to get to bed and make\nhimself as comfortable as possible. The next day he sent me word\nthat he enjoyed a long night of sound sleep, and was free from\npain.\nIn the spring of 1894, I met an Irishman who takes care of\nfurnaces in the winter and lawns in the summer, and found him\nsuffering with muscular rheumatism, attended with much lameness and\npain. The trouble had been so bad that he had been unable to do his\nwork during a large part of the winter, and when I saw him he was\nhobbling along with a cane. This case I relieved with a single treat\nment, so that he declares he has not felt a touch of it since.\nBefore leaving this part of the subject, some reference should be\nmade to methods of hypnotism to which my own experiments seem to\nbe closely allied,\u2014methods of little interest to the popular audience\nfor which this paper was originally prepared, but having an important\nbearing on the issue here raised.\nWhile it is common for hypnotised subjects to manifest certain\npronounced symptoms of trance, it is claimed that true hypnosis may\nexist when no such signs can be detected. Instead of amnesia,\nhyperesthesia, anaesthesia, etc., with suspension of the higher brain\nfunctions, there may be nothing more definite than a slight drowsiness\nor heaviness to show that the subject has passed into a state of\n\"suggestibility.\" It is easy to conclude that, for therapeutic purposes,\nstrongly marked signs of the trance need not be present, the essential\ncondition being ready obedience to the suggestions made.\nHow subjects are brought into this condition and what is the true\nrelation between the operator and the subject are concisely explained\nby Dr. Walter Leaf, in a review of Moll's Der Rapport in der Hypnose,\n\fSuggestion without Hypnotism. 29\netc. He says : \" These experiments [of Dessoir and Moll], and many\nothers like them, all point convincingly to the conclusion that rapport\nis not a physical but a psychical phenomenon : that it is produced not\nby any action of an effluence from the operator, magnetic or otherwise,\nbut by the action of the subject's own mind, obedient to suggestions\nwhether received externally or spontaneously generated. It is natural\nto conclude that rapport is no more than a concentration of attention\n\u25a0on the operator, an exaggerated case of the state of mind which in its\n.different degrees we know in ordinary life as reverie, abstraction,\n' absence of mind,' and so on.\"1\nProfessor William James, referring to the so called Nancy method\nof producing the hypnotic trance, writes : \" The simplest one is to\nleave the subject seated by himself, telling him that if he close his\neyes and relax his muscles and, as far as possible, think of vacancy, in\n\u00a3l few minutes he will ' go off.' On returning in ten minutes you may\nfind him effectually hypnotised.\" 2\nIt would be a rare psychical event for a person, who had never\nbeen hypnotised and whose attention had not been previously called to\nthe matter, to lapse into the trance-sleep in obedience to auto-suggestion\nalone. A novice seems to require something more than a spontaneously\ngenerated impulse to enable him to \" go off.\" The operator convinces\nhim that the proposed experiment is desirable and harmless ; his free\n.consent is asked and obtained ; means are used to lead him to con\ncentrate his attention on the operator. Altogether, these appeals and\nthe action of his own mind amount to a powerful suggestion, well\n\u25a0calculated to initiate the desired psychical phenomenon in the average\nsubject. And it may be added that hypnosis itself is produced by\nsuggestions received by the subject before he goes off.\nIf we accept Dr. Moll's definition of hypnotism, is there any evi\ndence that it formed part of the psychical experience of the hundreds\nof patients whom I have treated in the manner herein described ?\nIt is natural to suppose that among so many cases of hypnosis (?),\nthere would be some at least so pronounced as not to be mistaken ;\nespecially would this be likely to happen in the case of patients who\nreceived a series of such treatments ; but I cannot recall a single\ninstance of the kind. It may be insisted, however, that only slight\nmanifestations were to be expected, because, like Dr. Russell Sturgis,\nI hypnotised only \" to the first degree ; \" therefore we must pursue\nthe inquiry farther, and find out if the necessary steps were taken to\nproduce any such results.\nNone of my patients expected me to hypnotise them ; nor do I\n1 Proceedings S.P.R., Part XXIV., Vol. IX., p. 213.\n2 The Principles ofPsychology, Vol. II., p. 593.\n\f30 C. M. Barrows.\nbelieve that even 5 per cent of them associated a thought of hypnotism\nwith what I was trying to do for them. The instances were rare\nindeed in which a patient during treatment concentrated his (or her)\nattention on \" vacancy,\" on thoughts of sleep, or on me ; in many cases\nthe indications pointed strongly the other way.\nIn one case the patient, a literary gentleman, wrote concerning his\nmental experiences during the treatments he had received : \" I was\nnever aware of the particular thing suggested each time, but\nonly of the desired outcome of all the treatments. During the\nsuggestion we [operator and patient] sat quietly without speaking, my\nmind being perfectly at liberty. The suggestion occupied as a rule\nabout twenty minutes, during which time I usually repeated poetry to-\nmyself, or looked across to Boston, of which there is a fine view to be\nhad from Mr. Barrows's windows.\" A lady who received six treatments\nfor the cure of intermittent headache, read a fascinating book while I\nwas operating. By a single suggestion I relieved a child from severe\npain, who was not aware of my presence in the room. She was lying\non a bed beside which sat her nurse ; I entered the room noiselessly,\nsat down where she could not see me, and, after doing my work, went\nout without having attracted her notice, so that there was no chance\nfor expectancy or attention on her part. Here is another case in\nwhich hypnotism would seem to have been impossible. In September,\n1895, I became an inmate of a house occupied by a family of the name\nof Meyers. I had been there only a few days when Mrs. Meyers met\nme in the corridor one forenoon, and told me that her son, a boy of\nsix, was troubled with very annoying facial spasms. She said that his\nfather and herself had used every means in their power to break up\nand cure the habit, but with no apparent effect. I had then seen very\nlittle of the boy, but offered to try and help him by suggestion ; and\nhis mother on her part promised that Willie should not be told any\nthing about the matter. About three o'clock in the afternoon of the\nsame day, I looked out of the window, near which I was at work, and\nsaw the boy playing with some other children on the lawn below. It\nseemed a favourable time to try the proposed suggestion, and, taking;\ncare that he should not see me, I made it then and there. It was com\npletely successful, for all the family noticed that Willie's facial trouble\nceased from that day on.\nA cogent argument in support of the theory herein set forth might\nbe based upon the striking analogy of this method of psychical treat\nment to that of telepathic suggestion or so-called thought-transference ;\nfor the same form of suggestion used in therapeutic experiments I\nhave found to be most successful in the sending of telepathic messages -r\nand there is no doubt that an agent may suggest definite sensations to-\na percipient, who will receive and experience them without the aid of\n\fSuggestion without Hypnotism. 31\nhypnotism ; while to assume that the agent could hypnotise a distant\npercipient, on whom he had not previously operated, would be mani\nfestly absurd.\nThe analgesia or inhibition induced by suggestion is liable to be\nconfounded with something quite different. It is not a general\nstupifying and deadening of all sensation, like that produced by ether\nor narcotics ; neither does it benumb a group of nerve-endings, or\ndeprive a limited segment of tissue of all feeling, as cocaine does.\nMr. P. W. H. Myers says : \" It is by no means a mere ordinary\nnarcotic\u2014a fresh specimen of the methods already familiar for\nchecking all conscious cerebration. It is a new departure ; it is the first\nsuccessful attempt at dissociating forms of sensation which throughout\nthe known history of the human organism have almost invariably\nbeen found to exist together.\"\nThere is certainly implied, in every such case of suppression or pre\nvention of pain, a principle and power of selection intelligently\nexercised, by which the suggesting agent, whoever it be, singles out\nfrom the various sensations that a nerve or group of nerves may be\ncapable of producing the one called pain, and imposes a stay-law\nupon it. Suggestion which cures one pain does not necessarily\nsuppress every pain in the body, as we have seen in the case of the\nman whose ankle was relieved, while his arm continued to ache. It\ndoes not always remove the exciting cause of pain. The legitimate\nfunction of therapeutic suggestion seems to be to act upon a special\noccasion for a limited time, and such action may take place immedi\nately, or be postponed ; or, in some instances, a permanent beneficial\nchange is the result achieved.\nI find it impossible to tell in a given case whether this psychical\nremedy will act quickly or slowly. I treated the Irish day labourer\nwho had been suffering many months with general muscular rheu\nmatism, and in five minutes all the lameness and pain were gone, and\nthe trouble has not returned for nearly two years. I treated a girl\nof thirteen who had a seated pain in the fleshy part of her right\nshoulder, due to a sprain of the deltoid muscle which had been cured,\nand the suggestion was repeated twice a week for six weeks before the\npain completely vanished. Some slight ailment often seems to offer\ngreater resistance than a much graver disease. Cases of obstinate\ninsomnia and mental depression are apt to yield more readily than\nheadache or indigestion. Stage-fright, worry, and definite fears, are\neasily cured in this way ; while a fixed delusion, or other troublesome\nidea, may be hard to dislodge.\nAny theories we may devise as to the nature and mode of this form\nof suggestion, based on present knowledge, must needs be provisional ;\n\f32 G. M. Barrows.\nand a wise man will hold them loosely, ready to abandon them at any\ntime for better. In matters which continually baffle the most profound\nstudents, it certainly becomes us to speak with modesty and caution.\nI feel quite unable to offer an adequate solution of the problems to\nwhich I have called attention ; but I am convinced that the psychical\ninfluence employed in these and many other experiments which I have\nmade is a form of telepathy, and ought to be studied as such. A\ntelepathic message is a suggestion of an agent that the percipient per\nform an act or feel a sensation. If the percipient be suffering pain,\nand the agent suggests to him a feeling or state of ease, the proper\nresponse on the part of the percipient would be a sense of relief from\npain. Perhaps it does not help us much to say this, for telepathy\nimplies an agency inscrutable to us at present.\nNor can the real difficulties which confront the student be dis\nmissed or evaded with the shallow remark : \" It is only another\ncase of the power of mind over mind.\" It ought to be plain enough\nto any one capable of grasping the situation, that the form of psychical\nsuggestion under consideration is no more addressed to the mind of\nthe patient than an opiate prescribed for quieting pain is addressed to\nthe mind. Do not forget that I use \" mind \" in the popular sense.\nThe patient swallows the dose as directed, but experiences no mental\nchange in consequence ; but if the sedative eases the pain, he may then\nthink far enough to refer the relief to the operation of the drug. If\ninstead of an opiate a silent suggestion be made that the pain cease,\nthe patient is not even aware that such a telepathic message has been\nlodged in his brain ; he does not know that anything has been done,\ntherefore he cannot act upon it mentally ; but after the proper neural\nresponse has taken place, he may recall what has happened, and ascribe\nthe cessation of pain to the suggestion.\nIf the psychical experiments which I have made, a small number of\nwhich are described in this paper, are indeed instances of telepathy,\nthen it follows that a telepathic message may be received by a per\ncipient, and may produce within him a definite physical change,\nwithout becoming matter of conscious thought at all. Again, admit\nting it to be telepathy, we may make free use of all that is known\nabout that mysterious subject to aid us in explaining this special\ngroup of phenomena. We must also encounter the unsolved problems\nwhich lie at the very threshold of investigation,\u2014problems so profound\nthat one must think long and abandon many a plausible theory\nbefore one can appreciate their scope even on the hither side. Por\nif telepathy be what the findings of scientific research foreshow, no\ninvention, no discovery ever made by man is worthy to be compared\nwith it. It implies nothing less than a revolution in our science of\nmind.\n\fSuggestion without Hypnotism. 83\nThe paramount inquiry in this as in other forms of telepathic\naction is, How is it done 1 And this question naturally divides into\ntwo : first, Who is the agent ? Second, By what means does the agent\nwork 1\nI suppose it is not too much to claim that psychical investiga\ntion has made some definite progress towards answering these two\nbaffling questions, has in some fashion reached a provisional hypo\nthesis. But if any headway has been made, the light has always\ncome by studying together many different groups of related pheno\nmena, and never by studying a single group apart from the rest.\nThen if it be granted that these cases of psychical suggestion con\nstitute a group of phenomena apparently unclassified, we shall gain\nmuch if we find that it properly belongs with some collection already\nmade.\nScanning our group as a naturalist examines his specimens for the\nfeatures common to them all, we find that in every one of these cases of\ninhibition of pain some other agent than ordinary mental power\nbrought about the result. Assuming this fact as a basis of classifica\ntion, we make the further discovery that the same thing is true of a\nlarge collection of psychical phenomena already made ; that is to say,\nthe distinguishing fact appearing in each member of this collection is\nthat some other agent than ordinary mental power acted through a\nhuman organism and produced the results observed. I need only refer\nto a few cases of this kind to remind you of the whole class.\nThere are occasions, you are aware, in the lives of most people,\nwhen they are surprised out of their habitual ways of thinking and\ndoing, and act in spontaneous obedience to irresistible promptings\nwhich come they know not whence. Such experiences are memorable\nbecause when the actor recalls what then took place, he perceives that\nhe thought something or did something for which he could give no\nreason, save that one which explains everything or nothing, as you take\nit : \" It came to me.\"\nExamples of this kind are not far to seek. A lady said to me the\nother day in explanation of her absence from home, \" I was busy that\nmorning in my usual fashion, when it suddenly came to me, I can't\ntell how, only it seemed like a voice that said, ' Go to your sister, she\nneeds you.' The call was as clear and imperative as though I had\nreceived a telegram or a letter, and I knew I ought to go.\" At the\nclose of the Civil War, a northern gentleman with a partner established\na mercantile business in a Virginia city. After being there several\nmonths, he awoke from sleep in the middle of the night with the thought\nimpressed upon his mind, \" There is something wrong at the store and\nI must go and see about it.\" He could not account for this vivid\nimpression, for his sleep had been sound and undisturbed by dreams ;\nD\n\f34 C. M. Barroivs.\nbut obeying the summons he called up his partner, and together they\nhastened to the place, just in season to prevent their money from\nbeing carried off by a burglar. Several years ago a citizen of\nBrooklyn, N.Y., while on a visit to another city, dreamed one night\nthat she saw a large block on the opposite side of the street from her\nown home burn down, and the accounts in the newspapers next\nmorning proved her to have been dreaming of an actual event.\nWhen Mr. Benjamin Blyth, one of the \"arithmetical prodigies,\"\nwas six years old, he asked his father, as they were taking a morning\nwalk, \"At what hour was I born?\" \"At four a.m ,\" answered his\nparent. \"And what o'clock is it now?\" \"Seven fifty,\" said the\nfather. After walking on in silence for a few hundred yards, Ben\nturned to his father and stated just how many seconds he had lived.\nMr. Blyth noted down the figures given by his son, made the calcula\ntion on reaching home, and told Ben he was 172,800 seconds wrong.\n\" Oh, papa,\" exclaimed the child, \" you have left out the two extra\ndays in the leap years 1820 and 1824,\" which was true.\nMr. Wm. J. Stillman said that Mr. Lowell once told him that he\nwrote \" The Vision of Sir Launfal \" in two evenings, and never re\ntouched the poem. An entry in Longfellow's diary, dated December\n30th, 1839, reads: \" I wrote last evening a notice of Allston's poems,\nafter which I sat till twelve o'clock by my fire, smoking, when\nsuddenly it came into my mind to write the ' Ballad of the Schooner\nHesperus'; which I accordingly did. Then I went to bed, but could\nnot sleep. New thoughts were running in my mind, and I got up to add\nthem to the ballad. I feel pleased with the ballad. It hardly cost\nme an effort. It did not come into my mind by lines, but by stanzas.\"\nGeorge Eliot declared that, in all she considered her best writing, there\nwas a \" not herself \" which took possession of her, and that at such\ntimes she felt her own personality to be merely the instrument\nthrough which this spirit acted. George Inness, the painter, once told\nme that his best compositions came to him as visions ; that then a\npower which did not move him at other times drove him to work\nincessantly, yet with no tiresome effort, until his concept was fixed\nupon the canvas.\nThe publications of this Society contain accounts of many similar\nexperiences, and others more remarkable. You remember the series of\narticles on \" The Subliminal Consciousness,\" in which Mr. Myers\ntreats of such phenomena, and what he there says about the Daemon of\nSocrates, the monitory voices heard by Joan of Arc, the thirteen\n\" Arithmetical Prodigies,\" and the inspirations of genius in general.\nYou see from these few examples to what collection I assign my\ngroup of phenomena. You know also, those of you who are acquainted\nwith the results of recent investigation, that the phenomena embraced\n\fSuggestion without Hypnotism. 35\nin this large collection are believed to have been produced by some\nother agency than the ordinary process of normal cerebration.\nAccording to the most scientific opinions now held, it was the\nSubliminal Self that called the lady to her sister's bedside, roused the\nmerchant from sleep, enabled the distant dreamer to see the Brooklyn\nfire, whispered to little Ben Blyth how old he was, indited the poems\nof the Cambridge bards, held the pen of Mrs. Lewes, moved the brush\nof George Inness, guided Socrates, commanded the Maid of Orleans,\nand inspired every gifted artist whose works bear the stamp of genius.\nThus do the conclusions of modern science confirm the dictum of\nNbvalis, \" The art of a well developed genius is far different from\nthe artfulness of the understanding, of the merely reasoning mind.\"\nThe common bond of relation between the form of suggestion of\nwhich this paper treats and the phenomena belonging to this great\npsychical class is that the source of the manifested power is the same\nin both. The action, subliminally initiated, produced a change in living\nbrain, and ultimately modified certain movements in living bodies ;\nand the evidence of this mode of action is strong enough, it seems to\nme, to justify the following inferences :\u20141. This subliminal agent,\nwhich acts directly upon brain substance to produce certain recognised\neffects, may also be the cause of other observed effects not now ascribed\nto it. 2. If this subliminal agent does sensibly affect one group of\nbrain cells (as those immediately concerned in thinking), another group\nof cells may be so affected. 3. If this subliminal agent has chosen\ncertain brains to be the immediate organs and vehicles of its power, we\nhave no right to draw the line there, and affirm that this agent never\nextends that same power through these immediate organs to other\nliving brains. 4. If this subliminal agent act through that portion of\nthe brain assumed to be the seat of the mental faculties, then, for\naught we know to the contrary, the same agent may act through other\nportions of the brain not concerned in thinking, to produce effects\nunrecognised by mind, as currents traverse the nerves which co-ordinate\nmotility.\nConsidering, therefore, what deductions may easily be made in the\npremises, I incline to ask those who are wiser in such matters than I,\nif the kind of suggestion here treated of be not the power of this\nsubliminal agent, exerted directly upon the proper nerve centres to\ncontrol a particular sensation.\nI said a moment ago that the question of paramount interest in\nthis connection divides itself into two. I have tried to give in a\ncondensed form the answer of science to the first. May I presume on\nyour patience, and offer a word of reply to the second ?\nBy what means does this subliminal agent work ? We wish to\nknow how this subtle energy, which acts through a particular brain,\nd 2\n\f36 C. M. Barrows.\ncan make itself felt in another brain, near or remote. By the con\nditions of the problem, the communication or message cannot traverse\nany recognised sensory channel on its way from one brain to another,\nbut must be conveyed by telepathy. Very well. If telepathy be\naccepted as a fact in nature, just as the passage of light from distant\nstars is accepted as a fact, we want to know how the message is\ncarried through space. Science has assumed a luminiferous ether\nthrough which \"star to star vibrates light,\" and many persons seem\ncontent to believe that communications pass from brain to brain by\nmeans of the same material vehicle. But another theory is possible.\nWhat if it should appear that this subliminal agent is simply one\nintelligent actor filling the universe with its presence, as the ether fills\nspace, the common inspirer of all mankind 1 By what authority is\nit assumed that this wizard self resident in one man is related to\nthe selves of other men merely as, in the language of theology,\none personal soul is related to the rest 1 Are we sure that this\ntranscendent energy is parted into numberless distinct entities, one\nfor each human being?\nShould we plunge into a darker mystery, were we to compare this\nsubliminal agent or self to a skilled musician presiding over many\npipes and keys, and playing through each what music he will T\nImagine each human being one of millions of animate organs, through\nwhose mind and body one unified, all-pervasive, immaterial self blows\nwith the breath of energy to make the varied music we call life. If\nthis were true, then would the subliminal self be a universal fountain\nof energy and each man an outlet of the stream ; each man's personal\nself would be contained in it and thus made one with every other ;\nand with a slight change we might adopt the quotation : \" In that\ndeep force, the last fact behind which analysis cannot go, all psychical\nand bodily effects find their common origin.\"\nAPPENDIX.\nCorroborative testimony as to several of the cases mentioned above\nwas obtained by Mr. Barrows, and sent by him to Dr. Hodgson. The\nletter from Dr. Burrell, however, was addressed direct to Dr. Hodgson.\nMr. Barrows himself writes :\u2014\nBrookline, January 1st, 1896.\nMy Dear Dr. Hodgson,\u2014I have been extremely busy with some very\ninteresting experiments, or you would have received what your letter of\nyesterday calls for sooner. I can now give you all I am able to get in each\nof the cases mentioned in my paper. Taking them in order, I think the\nfollowing statement will be plain.\n\fSuggestion without Hypnotism. 37\n1. The lady who had five sittings with a Boston dentist is Mrs. C, of\nNew York\u2014letter enclosed.\n2. Seven cases where patients had teeth extracted : in the four\nchildren's cases, all happening years ago, I can get nothing of value. My own\ncase needs no vouchor, and the failure ditto. Have a letter from Mrs.\nChristensen, the lady of the last experiment.\n3. The Irish girl of seventeen, treated for neuralgia, was recently\nmarried, and, as Mrs. Lynch, her letter is enclosed.\n4. The Welshman, cured of neuralgia in eye and ear, is Mr. Woodfin, for\nwhom I wrote the enclosed statements, which he and his wife signed.\n5. The school teacher, treated six years ago for neuralgia, went West,\nand I find no trace of her.\n6. Man with carbuncle was a soldier, whose name, regiment, etc., I did\nnot get at the time, for I did not then think of putting the experiment to use.\nHe was a stranger, stopping temporarily at a hotel, and I know not what\nbecame of him.\n7. Man with kidney trouble\u2014with stricture of urethra\u2014died years\nago. He was Mr. William Willward, a teacher of Elocution, in Providence,\nR.I. His widow (his only family survivor) left Providence, I was told, and\nI do not know where she is. I may be able to get track of her in a month or\ntwo, and get a statement about the case.\n8. Mr. Morse, the man with sprained ankle, contributes two letters, one\nabout this case, another about a cure of intermittent headache.\n9. Poor woman with pinched finger joint contributes statement, written\nand confirmed by her daughter, Mrs. Henderson.\n10. Young married lady, treated in 1894, for intercostal pain, died a few\nmonths later ; disease, melancholia. Her family know the facts ; but, for\nreasons 1 have never been able to fathom, her husband has made a false\ncharge of fraud against me, and will have no communication with me.\n11. The business man on Chester Park, treated for rheumatism, now lives\nin New York, and contributes a statement.\n12. The illiterate Irishman, also treated for rheumatism, signed a state\nment which I wrote out.\n13. Can get nothing just now about the girl of thirteen, with pain in\ndeltoid. Her aunt, who lives here, informs me that the girl with all the\nfamily (the A. 's) are in Germany, and Mrs. A. is critically ill. May get a\nstatement when she recovers, from both mother and daughter.\nThese are all the cases of prevention or suppression of pain mentioned in\nthe paper, of which a detailed statement is made. Two or three others of a\nsomewhat different character are alluded to incidentally.\nYou will bear in mind that during the years in which these experiments\nwere performed I had no motive for securing vouchers, as I did not then\ncontemplate using any such evidence.\nI do not see in what way a physician's statement would strengthen the\nevidence in these cases, since he could not bear witness to the treatment. In\ncases involving dental operations, the operator, even if he recalled the case,\ncould not vouch for anything. In cases 3, 9, 12, no physician was employed.\n\f38 G. M. Barrows.\nMr. Morse had three physicians during the progress of his sprain ; what\nthey could say, I do not know. Neither of thein saw him while he was\nunder my treatment. I will get their addresses if desirable. Mr. Chadwick\nhad medical attendance before I treated him, and it might be of interest to\ndetermine the possible effect of the medicines prescribed on the subsequent\ncure, if the doctor could now tell what doses were taken. But we must not\nforget that it is the stopping of pain by suggestion which is to be proved, not\nwhether the patient recovered. What could a doctor testify to that 1\nAt my desire Mrs. A. took her daughter to Dr. Geo. W. Gay, of\nBoston, before I treated her, and he wrote me on a prescription slip,\n\"sprain of the right deltoid muscle.\"\u2014I enclose the slip. Please preserve.1\n\u2014Very truly yours, c M Barrows.\n(1) Letter from Mrs. C. (See p. 22.)\nNew York City, November 21st, 1895.\nDr. Richard Hodgson,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014At the request of Mr. C. M. Barrows\nof Brookline, Mass., I write you my experience under psychical treatment.\nSeveral years ago while living in Brookline, I was in an extremely nervous,\nrun-down condition, and was obliged to have several teeth filled.\nI went to Mr. Barrows for treatment before going to Boston to the\ndentist, and I think Mr. Barrows also gave me another treatment while I was\nin the dentist's chair.\nMy teeth were particularly sensitive and I was enabled to go through the\nordeal with very little pain, and when I felt pain it was as if on the outside of\nme. I did not mind it, and after leaving the dentist I did not feel that\nnervous exhaustion which I had always before experienced. Three or four\ntimes I went to the dentist's having taken treatments before going, and I\nfelt very little pain and did not mind it ; but the fifth time I neglected to\nhave the treatment and suffered very much, showing me conclusively that\nthe pain was very much lessened by psychical treatment.\nIf you wish to publish this statement, I would thank you not to use my\nname. While I am a firm believer in psychical treatment, I would prefer not\nto have my name appear publicly.\u2014Very truly yours,\n(Signed)\n(2) Letter from Mrs. Christensen. (See p. 23.)\n17, Harvard-street, Brookline, Mass., November 11th, 1895.\nDr. Richard Hodgson,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014In September, 1894, before going to\nthe dentist to have a very sensitive double tooth extracted, I received\nsuggestive treatment from Mr. C. M. Barrows for the prevention of pain.\nI had been dreading the extraction, and also the after-effects, which have\nusually been very severe in my case.\nI found that I was keenly aware of the grasp of the forceps, of the force\nof the dentist's pull on the tooth, the tearing away, but I felt no pain during\nthe operation or subsequently.\nAlthough a raw, chilly, blustering day, I went at once to Boston and was\nexposed to the weather for some hours, but had no trouble in consequence,\n1 The slip enclosed contained the statement given above.\n\fSuggestion without Hypnotism. 39\nneither suffered at all from the pain and inflammation which usually have\nfollowed the extraction of a tooth. \u2014 Yours respectfully.\n(Mrs.) A. H. Christensen.\n(3) Letterfrom Mrs. Lynch. (See p. 25.)\n26, Sewall-street, Brookline, December 14th, 1895.\nDr. Richard Hodgson,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014In the early part of January I had\na bad attack of neuralgia in my left temple, which affected my eye and the\nside of my face. After I had been enduring the pain for several days and\ngrew no better, a friend took me to Mr. C. M. Barrows, who treated me by\npsychical suggestion. All the pain stopped while I was taking the first\ntreatment ; but the next night I had a hard headache, and he gave me two\nmore treatments, which cured it.\nMr. Barrows did not hypnotise me or do anything which I could see or\nfeel; he sat down beside me for about fifteen minutes without speaking and\nthe pain was gone.\u2014Yours respectfully, Mrs Agnbs Lynch.\n(4) Statement of Mr. Woodfin. (See p. 25. )\nSchool-street, Brookline, Mass., November 15th, 1895.\nDr. Richard Hodgson,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014I want to saythat I have been having\na great deal of trouble with my left ear and all that side of my head. When\nMr. C. M. Barrows began to treat me, about the middle of last September, I\nhad had a very hard pain in my ear for about two years. Almost every\nmorning, when I first woke up, and at different times during the day, there\nwould be sharp stabs of pain in my ear, very hard to bear. Besides the\ntroubles I have now spoken of, my left eye also began to be sore and blood\nshot about three weeks before Mr. Barrows took my case ; and it ached hard\nalmost all of the time.\nMr. Barrows did not give me medicine, but used what he called \"psychical\nsuggestion,\" and stopped all the pain very quickly. My eye got well first,\nthen my ear, then my head. Thomas H. Woodfin.\nI can testify to the truth of the above statement, and that, since my\nhusband received treatment from Mr. Barrows, he has been free from pain\nand better in every way ; he sleeps well and is not nervous.\nMrs. Lavinia Woodfin.\n(8) Lettersfrom Charles W. Morse. (Seep. 26.)\n[From] Charles W. Morse, watchmaker, jeweller, and stationer.\nBrookline, Mass. , November 29th, 1895.\nDr. Richard Hodgson,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014At your request I send the following\nparticulars of a cure, due, as I believe, to psychical suggestion, made by Mr.\nC. M. Barrows of this town.\nIn June, 1893, as I was hurrying to take a train at the Brookline station,\nI met with an accident in this wise : as I stepped from the platform upon\nthe track which I must cross to reach the train which was on the track\n\f40 C. M. Barrows.\nbeyond, having my little girl, six years old, raised in my hands, which pre\nvented my seeing where I was to step, I suppose I stepped on the edge of a\ntie, which turned my foot, throwing us both to the ground. I picked up my\nchild unhurt and hobbled into the train which was waiting ; not realising\nthe extent of my injury, and thinking the pain would soon cease. Such an\noccurrence was not uncommon with me, as that ankle had bothered me for\nyears in that way, as the result of a sprain in my boyhood. On reaching\nBoston I took an express train for Worcester ; but as the pain rapidly in\ncreased, 1 tried to obtain relief at the first stopping place, which was S.\nFramingham ; as the train was late, no stop could be made, and having a\nbrother in Ashland, the next station, I left the train there and called a\nsurgeon, Dr. Redfern of that town ; the ankle being badly swollen, it was\nimpossible to tell whether any bones were broken or not; the Doctor bandaged\nthe ankle and gave me a liniment, saying he would give me a year in which\nto get over it. I borrowed crutches and started for Brookline. On reaching\nhome, I did not call another physician immediately, as Dr. Redfern had said\n'' that it didn't make much difference what remedies were used, as the cure\nwould be simply a matter of time.\" As time went on, my ankle improved ;\nbut for some reason, I could not put my foot to the floor without intense\npain through the whole limb below the knee ; it was cold, also discoloured.\nIt was about four weeks after the accident that Dr. J. H. Woods of this\ntown offered to take me in to Boston to consult Dr. Burrell of the Mass.\nGen. Hospital. I accepted his offer and saw Dr. Burrell.\nAfter a thorough examination, in which he found that the flat bone on\nthe outside of the foot had been split open, (as he could feel where it had\nknit together) the two Doctors had a private consultation from which I was\nexcluded. Dr. B. said that the pain and discoloration were caused by\nstagnation of the blood ; and recommended plunging the limb into hot water\nand cold alternately, one minute in each ; and said that when the limb\nresumed its normal colour, the pain would cease. This treatment I followed\nfor several weeks, until the discoloration was nearly gone ; and it certainly\nafforded me much relief, but did not entirely banish the pain. This continu\nous pain, added to worry about my business, which I was unable to follow for\nseveral months, affected my nerves and head to a very great extent ; I\ncould neither eat nor sleep, and fell unconscious two or three times. I was\nreduced in weight to about 100 pounds, my usual weight being from 125 to\n130. I did not take any medicine to ease the pain or cause sleep. At this\ntime Dr. F. B. Percy of Brookline sent me away [from] home, as the only\nthing to be done in the case ; I was gone a month, and came back with my\nnerves somewhat steadier, and general health improved, but not rid of the\npain in my ankle which seemed to puzzle the Doctors. When I first talked\nwith Mr. Barrows in the last of September of the following year, 1894, the\npain was as intense as ever with no prospect of cessation ; it was continuous\nday and night ; it was just below the outer malleolus of the left ankle. Mr.\nBarrows came into my store and talked with me about my health, and\ninquired about my ankle. I told him my ankle seemed to be all right,\nexcept the pain, which was still there ; he then said, \" You had better come\nup and see me, and let me take the pain away.\" I called on him by\nappointment October 9th, 1894, and he gave me a treatment with no\n\fSuggestion without Hypnotism. 41\napparent result. I called again October 10th, no change. October 11th, I\nnoticed between the two treatments that day and the day before, there\nwere three or four hours in which I was free from pain. October 12th, the\npain left for a few hours. October 16th, no apparent change. October\n18th, the pain moved to the other foot. October 23rd, when I left Mr.\nBarrows, had no pain. October 24th, I did not call on Mr. B., but my foot\nached very hard, especially on the back of the ankle. October 25th, called\nagain, had much pain in my leg just above the ankle. October 30th,\nanother treatment ; since the 25th, have had darting pains, but on this day\nwas nearly free from pain. The next time I called, he did not give me a\ntreatment ; since that time have been entirely free from that peculiar\npain.\nNow in regard to the mode of treatment ; one half the time was taken up\nin discussing the subject ; there was no laying on of hands, neither was any\nspell cast over me. I was absolutely free all the time Mr. Barrows was\ntreating me ; just what the treatment was, it is impossible for me to say. I\nwill say this much, I was thoroughly prejudiced against it when I went there\nand had no faith whatever that Mr. Barrows would help me, but was\ndesperate and ready to try almost anything that offered even the slightest\nprospect of relief.

M. Barrows\nof this town.\nA few months after the treatments mentioned in a former letter to you, I\nwent to see Mr. Barrows again, while suffering from an intense headache. I\nhave been subject to severe headaches for years, but at this time they were\nmore frequent than usual, occurring every week for several weeks, and\nlasting two or three days at a time, rendering me unfit for everything.\nWhether Mr. Barrows' former treatments had had any effect on my head, I\ncannot say ; but one thing I do know, that the one special treatment he gave\nme at this time of which I am speaking, cured me ; and I have been almost\nentirely free from headache since that time. Just when I received that\ntreatment I cannot say, but it was about the last of March of the present\nvear- Chas. W. Morse.\nLetterfrom Dr. Herbert L. Burrell.\n[From Dr. H. L.

The history is essentially the same as he gives ; the \" Physi\ncal Examination\" is :\u2014\" The right foot from the middle of leg anteriorly to\nthe middle of dorsum of foot is swollen and ecchymosed. There is no frac\nture, but much tenderness about the external malleolus. To try massage,\npassive motion and a bandage.

(See p. 27.)\n11, Walnut-street, Brookline, Mass., November 20th, 1895.\nDr. Richard Hodgson,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014Last February I was cured in a-\nremarkable way of a pain from which I had suffered for nine years. In 1886,\nthe second finger of my right hand was pinched between the edges of two\nswinging doors, in the dry goods store of Jordan, Marsh and Co., Boston.\nThe second joint was badly hurt, and was very lame and sore for a long time\nbefore it seemed to heal. After it got so well that I could begin to use it,\nthe hurt joint was still enlarged and the whole finger so stiff that I could\nbend it only a little. Being my thimble finger, I had to use it as I was able,\nand almost every day it became swollen and ached. At times the pain was\nsevere, and, as I was obliged to work every day at washing, sewing, and\nother kinds of housework and could not favour it much, it ached more or\nless every night, and often was not free from pain for days together.\nOn the 4th of February, Mr. C. M. Barrows saw me while I was having\nan unusually bad time with this finger. He told me that he had sometimes\nhelped such cases, and examined the joint carefully, while questioning me\nabout it. He did nothing to the finger, but was quiet for not longer than\nthree minutes, I should say, when all the pain stopped, and I have had none\nof it since. I have been able to bend the finger and use it better ever since.\nIn two more treatments he also cured a painful lameness of my neck, which\nresulted from grippe.\u2014Respectfully yours, Mks James Honey-\nI can testify to the truth of abovo statement of my mother's, knowing\nhow much she suffered from her finger, and being at home when Mr. Barrows\nhelped her.\u2014Respectfully, Mrs a m Henderson.\n(11) Letterfrom Mr. Chadwick.

Cedar-street, New York, November 20th, 1895.\nDr. Richard Hodgson,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014I am pleased to place before you,\nat the request of Mr. C. M. Barrows, a certain case of sickness for which he\ntreated me.\nIt was in January, 1892, when I was then living in Boston. I had been\nsuffering for about a week with acute rheumatism, and had been unable to\nget much, if any, sleep at night. I was not able to get relief from any source,\nand decided to call in Mr. Barrows. He came in the evening, and after his\n\fSuggestion without Hypnotism. 43\ntreatment I enjoyed a refreshing night's sleep; the pain entirely disappeared,\nand since that time I have had only infrequent returns of the rheumatism.\u2014\nYours truly, j R Chadwick.\n(12) Letter from Mr. Harris. (See p. 28.)\n46, Morse Ave, Brookline, Mass., December 10th, 1895.\nDr. RichardHodgson,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014At the request of Mr. C. M. Barrows,\nI am glad to acknowledge the help I received from his method of treatment\nin the spring of 1894. I had been troubled with muscular rheumatism all\nthe previous winter, and had so much lameness and pain that it was often\nimpossible for me to attend to my work. I saw Mr. Barrows some time in\nMay, and he offered to help me if 1 would call at his house. I did so ; and\nI remember that my back and legs were aching hard, and I was so lame that\nit hurt me to sit down in the chair he placed for me. He sat in another\nchair several feet away, and asked some questions about my case ; then he\nstopped talking for two or three minutes, and I don't know what he did, but\nthe pain all left me. I began to move about, then stood up, and found the\nlameness gone too, and I have had no rheumatism since.\nJames H. Harris.\nThe following additional corroborations have been received while\nthis paper was passing through the press. The first refers to the case\ngiven on p. 30.\n58, University-road, Brookline, Mass., April 16th, 1896.\nDr. Richard Hodgson,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014I very willingly comply with the\nrequest of Mr. Barrows to corroborate his statement in regard to my\nson Willie. He had been troubled with a twitching of the face for several\nweeks. His father and I had tried to break him of the habit, but could\nnot. I told Mr. Barrows about it, as he says, one morning last September,\nand Willie had no more twitching after that day.\u2014Respectfully yours,\nBertha Meyers.\nThe next note, addressed to Dr. Hodgson, was received by him\non January 20th, 1896. It will be observed that the favourable\neffects produced by the treatment in this case seem to have been\nsomewhat slighter that in most of the cases described, and perhaps of\na more purely mental nature.\nDear Dr. Hodgson,\u2014I am glad to make an informal statement, to you,\nof Mr. Barrows' work with me ; although, for several reasons, I do not\nthink that I should care to have the same made public.\nMr. Barrows treated me last spring before an hour with the dentist,\nand on this occasion I experienced no pain at all ; although it is but fair\nto say that, on my questioning the dentist, he said that he could not be\nsure that what he had just done, should, of necessity, have produced pain.\nHe expected it would, but could not be certain in the matter.\nThis autumn and early winter Mr. Barrows has given me five or six\ntreatments for the same reason. These operations were more serious,\u2014a\n\f44 C. M. Barrows.\nsensitive wisdom tooth to be excavated and a large filling to be replaced\nin a position between the teeth which required preliminary \"wedging,\"\u2014\nbesides several minor operations. My experience with these hours in the\ndentist's chair have varied ;\u2014not, I think, so much according to the gravity\nof the work on the teeth, as,\u2014in so far as I can tell,\u2014according to my\nreceptivity toward Mr. Barrows' suggestion. At no time during these\nsittings has pain been totally suppressed ; although at times, I confess\nthat I have felt as if it were decidedly deadened\u2014the result seeming to me\nthe same as that producible by an anaesthetic. The general results, how\never, have been : a certain relaxed feeling in place of the usual nervous\ntension of such times ; a certain sense of indifference to the pain\u2014a\npurely mental state ; and an almost complete freedom from nervous pros\ntration after the operations. At the time of the operations,\u2014the time\nwhen Mr. Barrows' post-suggestion was to work,\u2014I have felt physical\ndrowsiness, a sense of eyelids being heavy, brain somewhat numb, etc.,\ncombined (although it may seem curious) with a sense of mental exhilara\ntion. These, I may add, are the symptoms I experience during a treatment\nof Mr. Barrows' ; though there is frequently added to these a slight sense\nof snapping in the head, as if the nerves were, in actuality, relaxing.\nAs I suffer habitually from over-tension of the nerves at the back of the\nhead and of the back, this is, perhaps, not extraordinary. This hyper\nsensitive condition of nerves (much less than formerly with me, but still\nevident) should perhaps be taken into account in considering the lack of\ntotal suppression of sensation in my case ; also, probably the fact that (I\nthink) I am very suggestible, and that, as I have always dreaded the\ndentist's instruments, I may make a strong auto-suggestion each time in\nfavour of pain. I fancy this to be the case, and have in the chair, once\nor twice, had the sensation as if one suggestion were struggling with\nanother,\u2014the sense of indifference to pain with that of dread. I am afraid\nI do not put this into scientific language and that it is not very available\nas testimony Believe me, etc,\n(Signed in full)\nDr. Hodgson writes with reference to the case of Mr. J.

Hodgson.\n\fPoltergeists. 45\nIV.\nPOLTERGEISTS.\nBy Frank Podmork.\nVisitations of raps and loud noises, accompanied by the throwing of\nstones, the ringing of bells, and other disturbances of an inexplicable\nkind have been known for many centuries. Mr. Lang (Cock Lane and\nCommon Sense, p. 170) cites a case as early as 856 a.d. In the last\ncentury there were many outbreaks of the kind, nor were the\nmanifestations confined to any one country. There was the celebrated\nCock Lane case, occurring in London in 1762 ; there was a tumult\nof bell-ringing in the Russian monastery of Tzarekonstantinoff in\n1753 1 ; and we hear of a case, in 1750, in Saxony, of mysterious\nstone-throwing which lasted for some weeks, much to the annoyance\nof a clergyman and his two sisters who were the victims of the\noutbreak.2 In a small and now rare book, called Bealings Bells,\npublished in 1841 by Major Moor, F.R.S., for sale at a Church\nbazaar, accounts* are given, mostly at first-hand, of some 20 cases of\nthis kind. The disturbances described in Bealings Bells consisted\ngenerally of bell-ringing, but they included occasional noises of other\nkinds, movements of furniture, throwing of crockery and small objects.\nThe S.P.R. has received many reports of similar disturbances. Two\nof the most striking have already been published by Mr. Myers in the\nProceedings. (See Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VII., pp. 160-173, and\npp. 383-394\u2014Mr. Bristow's case.) In these two cases no opportunity\nwas afforded of personal investigation ; but in several instances\nMembers of the Society have been able, either to be present during the\nactual occurrence of the disturbances, or to visit the locality and\ninterrogate the witnesses immediately after the events. In the present\npaper it is proposed to deal with the results of these investigations.\nI.\u2014The Worksop Case.\nThe first case of the kind occurred at Worksop in 1883. Subjoined\nis a report, drawn up at the time, of my inquiries a few weeks after\nthe occurrences described.\n1 The Russian Archives, 1878, pp. 278\u20149, translated and forwarded to us by\nT. Bruhns.\n2 Annali dello Spiritismo, quoted in Light, February 22nd, 1896.\n\f46 Frank Podmore.\nReport on the Wokksop Disturbances. By F. Podmore.\nApril 11th, 1883.\nAt the beginning of March, 1883, the Retford and Gainsborough Times\nand other local papers gave accounts of some remarkable disturbances which\nhad occurred in the first two or three days of the month, at the house of a\nsmall horse-dealer in Worksop, named Joe White. One or two members\nof the Society entered into communication with the principal persons named\nin the newspaper reports, and with a friend in the neighbourhood, who\nvery kindly took some trouble in inquiring into the matter for the Society.\nBut it soon became obvious that, as nearly all the witnesses of the\noccurrences related were of the humbler class, and unable, therefore, to\nwrite a connected account of what had happened, the best way to arrive at\nthe truth of the matter was for one of us to go in person to make inquiries.\nAccordingly, at the request of the Haunted House Committee, I went down\nto Worksop on the afternoon of Saturday, April 7th, with the intention of\ninspecting the actual scene of the occurrences, and of personally interro\ngating the principal witnesses ; in order, if possible, to arrive at some\nrational explanation of the business. I spent the Saturday evening and\nthe whole of the following day in my inquiries, and have, I think, obtained\nas intelligible and trustworthy a history of the matter as the lapse of time,\nthe nature of the phenomena themselves, and the character of the witnesses\nwill permit.\nI derived my information from seven principal eye-witnesses of the dis\nturbances, whom I interrogated, with the single exception of White himself,\nseparately. I wrote out the statement of each witness in full immediately\nafter the interview, and the three most important witnesses, Higgs,\nCurrass, and White, subsequently read through my notes and signed them.\nThe depositions of these three persons are printed in full below. My time\nwas too short to allow a second interview with the four other principal\nwitnesses, and I was unable, therefore, to obtain their signatures to the\ndepositions ; but I have incorporated the statements of all the principal\nwitnesses in my report.\nBesides the seven chiefly concerned, I questioned, in presence of White\nand his wife, three or four other witnesses of the disturbances, viz.,\nWhite's brother Tom, a bright-looking lad of 18 or 20 ; Solomon Wass and\nhis wife, next-door neighbours of the Whites, the former an ordinary\nNorth countryman of the lower class, the latter a pleasant-looking, intelli\ngent woman ; and George Ford (Buck Ford), a man of about 28. From\nthese I obtained general confirmation of the various incidents, as described\nby White, Higgs, &c., at which they had themselves been present ; but time\ndid not permit of much cross-questioning, nor of taking down their evidence\nin full.\nWhite's house has been built, according to his own statement, about\nseven years. He has only resided in it three years. I was unable to\ndiscover anything about the former occupants. The house stands at the end\nof a piece of waste land, called the New Building Ground, with another\nhouse or cottage attached ; the nearest separate building being a public-\nhouse, about 1U0 yards off. With that exception, there are no other buildings\nwithin about 200 yards.\n\fN\nN\nN\nYard,\nwith\npiggeries,\n&c,\non\nthe\nsides\nmarked\nN\nand\nO.\nA\n1\n\u2022\n3\nSi\n5\nB if a<5\nKITCHEN\nM\n(m\nH\nM\na\nFront\nroom,\nused\nas\na\nbedroom\n;\nthe\nfront\ndoor being\nlocked,\nand\nhaving\npaper\npasted\nover\nit,\nso\nthat\nit\ncould\nnot\nbe\nopened\nwithout\ndetection.\nA\nOuter\ndoor.\nB\nA\ncask. 0\nThe\nbin.\nD\nFireplace.

M\nChairs.\n\f48 Frank Podmore.\nThere is no entrance to the house by the front, the front door being\nlocked, and the joints secured with paper from the inside. Entrance is\nobtained by a covered passage, open at either end, which separates the twc\nhouses, and gives access immediately to a yard, surrounded on one side by\nhigh palings, and on the other three by piggeries, stables, and the two\nhouses. The plan of the ground-floor of White's house is apparent from the\naccompanying sketch. The kitchen is about 15 ft. square. The upper floor\nis divided into two rooms, the back one, corresponding to the kitchen, being\nused as a bedroom for Tom and the children ; the front one as a store-house\nfor bacon, horse-furniture, and various odds and ends. There is also a\ngarret above this, into which I did not enter, it being at the time full of\nbacon in salt. The whole house, not excepting the bedrooms, is hung with\nbacon, the very staircase being lined with it, so that I had to draw my coat\nclose to me in going up. A large part of the bacon, as I was told by White,\nhad gone bad during the period of the disturbances.\nThe front or inner room on the ground-floor was an ordinary room, like\nall the rest of the house half filled with bacon, and containing, besides\nbedroom furniture, a large beer-barrel on trestles ; everything in it filthily\ndirty.\nI looked all over the house in daylight, but could discern no holes in the\nwalls or ceilings, nor any trace of the extensive and elaborate machinery\nwhich would have been required to produce the movements by ordinary\nmechanical means.\nThe history of the disturbances, as gathered from the various witnesses\nwhom I interrogated, appears to be briefly as follows :\u2014\nNothing remarkable had been seen or heard in the house until about the\n20th or 21st February, 1883, when, as Mrs. White was alone with two of the\nchildren in the kitchen one evening, washing up the tea-things at the table,\nthe table tilted up at a considerable angle ; the candle was upset, and the\nwash-tub only saved by Mrs. W. holding it. She positively assured me that\nshe exerted no pressure whatever upon the table, and the whole incident\nstruck her as very extraordinary. Her husband made light of it at the time.\nOn Monday, February 26th, White was absent from home until the\nWednesday afternoon. On the Monday his wife allowed a girl, Eliza Rose,\nthe child of an imbecile mother, to come into the house and share her bed at\nnight. White returned on Wednesday night, but left on the following\nmorning until Friday afternoon. During that one night the girl slept on\nthe squab. On Thursday night, March 1st, at about 11 p.m., Tom White\nwent up to bed\u2014the children having gone up some hours before. At about\n11.30, Mrs. White and Eliza Rose being then alone in the kitchen, various\nthings, such as a corkscrew, clothes-pegs, a salt-cellar, &c., which had been\nin the kitchen only a few minutes before, came tumbling step by step down\nthe kitchen stairs. Tom positively and solemnly denied having thrown the\narticles, and the mystery was increased when, at least 20 minutes after he\nhad gone upstairs, no one having left the room in the interval, some hot coals\nwere thrown down.\nOn the following night, March 2nd, at about the same hour\u2014White,\nMrs. White, and Rose being in the kitchen\u2014a noise was heard as of some*\n\fPoltergeists. 49\none coming down the passage between the two houses, and stopping just\noutside the outer door. White told Rose to open the door, but she was too\nfrightened to do so. Then they heard a surcingle and immediately afterwards\nsome pieces of carpet thrown down the stairs. Then followed some knives\nand forks and other things. The girl picked them up ; but they followed\nstill faster. White then left the room to go up to Tom. During his absence\none of the ornaments flew off the mantelpiece into the corner of the room\nnear the door. Nothing was seen by the two women ; but they heard it fall,\nand found it there. Their screams summoned White down ; as he entered\nthe room his candle went out, and something struck him on the forehead.\nThe girl picked up the candle\u2014which appears to have left the candlestick\u2014\nand two new ones which had not been in the house previously, from the\nground ; and as soon as a candle was lit, a little china woman left the\nmantelpiece, and fell into the corner, where it was seen by White. As soon\nas it was replaced it flew across the room again, and was broken. Other\nthings followed, and the women being very frightened, and White thinking\nthat the disturbances presaged the death of his child, who was very ill with\nan abscess in the back, sent Tom (who was afraid to go alone) with Ford to\nfetch the doctor. Mrs. White meanwhile took one of the children next door.\nRose approached the inner room to fetch another, when things immediately\nbegan to fly about and smash themselves in that room. After this all appear\nto have been absent from the house for a short time. White then returned,\nwith Higgs, a policeman, and, whilst they were alone in the kitchen,\nstanding near the door, a glass jar flew out of the cupboard into the yard ; a\ntumbler also fell from the chest of drawers in the kitchen, when only Higgs\nwas near it. Both then went into the inner room, and found the chest of\ndrawers there turned up on end and smashed. On their return they found\nRose, Wass, and Tom White in the kitchen [? and Mrs. Wass], and all saw\na cream jug, which Rose had just placed on the bin, fly four feet up in\nthe air and smash on the floor. Dr. Lloyd and Mrs. White then entered,\nand in the presence of all these witnesses, a basin was seen to rise slowly\nfrom the bin\u2014no person being near it except Dr. Lloyd and Higgs. It\ntouched the ceiling, and then fell suddenly to the floor, and was smashed.\nThis was at 12 p.m. All then left except Tom White and his brother.\nThe disturbances continued until about 2 a.m., when all grew quiet, and\nthe Whites slept. At about 8 a.m., on Saturday, the 3rd, the disturbances\nbegan again.\nWhite left the kitchen to attend to some pigs ; and, in his absence, Mrs.\nWhite and Rose were left alone in the kitchen. A nearly empty port wine\nbottle leaped up from the table about four feet into the air, and fell into a\nbucket of milk, standing on the table, from which Mrs. White was filling\nsome jugs, &c.\nThen Currass appears to have been attracted to the scene. He entered\nwith White, young Wass, and others, and viewed the inner room. They\nhad but just returned to the kitchen, leaving the inner room empty, and the\ndoor of communication open, when the American clock, which hung over the\nbed, was heard to strike. (It had not done so for 18 months previously.)\nA crash was then heard, and Currass, who was nearest the door, looked in,\nand found that the clock had fallen over the bed\u2014about four feet broad\u2014\nK\n\f50 Frank Podmore.\nand was lying on the floor.1 Shortly afterwards \u2014no one being near it\u2014a\nchina dog flew off the mantelpiece, and smashed itself in the corner near the\ndoor. Currass and some others then left.\nSome plates, a cream-jug, and other things, then flew up in the air, and\n.smashed themselves in view of all who were in the kitchen\u2014Rose, the\nWhites, and Mrs. Wass.\nWhite then lay down on the sofa ; but disturbances continued during his\nsiesta. In particular, some pictures on the wall next the pantry began to\nmove, but were taken down at once by his brother. At about 2 p.m. a\nSalvation Army woman came in, and talked to White. Rose only was with\nthem in the kitchen. A candlestick flew from the bin, and fell behind the\nSalvation Army woman, as she stood near the pantry door. She left the\nroom in terror.\nOther things then followed at intervals. A full medicine bottle fell without\nbreaking. An empty medicine bottle and a lamp-glass fell and broke\nthemselves. It was then about 4 p.m., and White could stand it no longer.\nHe told the girl she must go ; she did in fact leave before 5 p.m. After her\ndeparture nothing whatever of an abnormal character took place, and the\nhouse has remained undisturbed up to the present time.\nWith regard to the positions of the persons present, in relation to the\nobjects moved, it may be stated generally that there was no possibility in\nmost cases of the objects having been thrown by hand. It will be seen, on\nreference to the depositions of the witnesses which are appended, that the\nobjects were frequently moved in a remote corner of the room, or even in\nan adjoining room. Moreover, the character of the movements, in many\ncases, was such as to preclude the possibility of the objects having been\nthrown.\nOf course the obvious explanation of these occurrences is trickery on the\npart of some of the persons present. In regard to this, it seems to me a.\nmatter of very little significance that most of the educated people in Worksop\nbelieve White himself to have caused the disturbance. For most educated\npersons, as we know, would not be ready to admit any other than a\nmechanical explanation, and if such an explanation be adopted, White, the\nowner of the house, a man of considerable intelligence, whose record was not\nentirely clean, and who was himself present on the occasion of nearly all the\ndisturbances, must obviously be the agent. But whilst believing White to\nbe at the bottom of the matter, none of the persons with whom I conversed\nwere prepared with any explanation of his modus operandi. That he should\nhave thrown the things was universally admitted to be impossible. And\n1 It will be noted that there is a discrepancy between White's and Currass'\nversion of this incident. Mrs. White, however, confirmed her husband's account ;\nand I have little doubt that the statement in the text is substantially accurate.\nCurrass is more likely than White to have been mistaken in his recollection of White's\nposition at the time ; and Currass' account of his own position does not differ greatly\nfrom that given by White. The material point, and one on which both witnesses are\nagreed, is that no one saw the clock fall. Currass' written statement is not clear on\nthis point, but he told me viva voce that his attention was drawn to what had taken\nplace by hearing the crash. He only then turned round and saw the clock lying on\nthe floor.\u2014F.P., April, 1883.\n\fPoltergeists. 51\nbeyond this, I could discover little more than an unquestioning faith in the\nomnipotence of electricity. No one professed to have any idea of what\nmechanical means could have been employed, or how they could have been\nadapted to the end in view. Still less did any one pretend to have discovered\nany indications in the house itself of any machinery having been used.\nMoreover, there was a total absence of any apparent motive on White's part,\nsupposing him to have been capable of effecting the movements himself.\nWhilst he was unquestionably a considerable loser\u2014to the extent of nearly\n\u00a39 as estimated by himself, though this estimate is probably exaggerated\u2014by\nthe articles broken, he appears to have reaped no corresponding advantage.\nThe one motive which I heard suggested\u2014if we disregard a report in one\nnewspaper, subsequently contradicted in another, to the effect that White\nwas anxious to buy the house, and to buy it cheap \u2014was that he produced\nthe disturbances in fulfilment of a sporting bet. But I saw no reason to\nregard this explanation as anything but a scholium evolved by some ingenious\ncommentator from the facts themselves.\nAgain, had White himself been the principal agent in the matter, it is\n\u25a0clear that he must have had at least two confederates, for he was not himself\npresent during the disturbances on the Thursday night\u2014which might,\nindeed, have been caused by his brother Tom\u2014nor was either he or his\n\"brother present during some of the occurrences on the following day. More\nover, these confederates must not only have been extremely skilful, but\nthey must have been capable of more than ordinary reticence and self-\ncontrol. For it is remarkable that, with the single exception of the statements\nmade by the girl Rose, no one professed to have heard even a hint from\nWhite himself, from his brother, or from any other, of any trickery in the\nmatter.\nMoreover, it is hard to conceive by what mechanical appliances, under the\ncircumstances described, the movements could have been effected. The\nclock, for instance, \u2014a heavy American one\u2014was thrust out from the wall\nin a horizontal direction, so as apparently to clear a 4ft. bedstead which lay\nimmediately beneath it, and the nail from which it depended remained in\nsitu on the wall. The objects thrown about in the kitchen moved generally,\nbut by no means always, in the direction of the outer door. And it is\nnoticeable that, in most cases, they do not appear to have been thrown, but\nin some manner borne or wafted across the room ; for, though they fell on a\nstone floor 15ft. or 16ft. distant, they were often unbroken, and were rarely\nshivered. And it is impossible to reconcile the account given of the move\nment of some other objects, variously described as \"jerky,\" \" twirling,\" and\n\"turning over and over,\" with the supposition that the objects depended\non any fixed support, or were in any way suspended.\nLastly, to suppose that these various objects were all moved by mechani\ncal contrivances argues incredible stupidity, amounting almost to imbecility,\non the part of all the persons present who were not in the plot. That the\nmovement of the arms necessary to set the machinery in motion should\nhave passed unobserved on each and every occasion by all the witnesses, is\nalmost impossible. Not only so, but Currass, Higgs, and Dr. Lloyd, all\nindependent observers, assured me that they examined some of the objects\nwhich had been moved, immediately after the occurrence, with the express\nB 2\n\f52 Frank Podmore.\nintention of discovering, if possible, any clue to an explanation of the\nmatter, but entirely failed to do so. These men were not over-credulous ;\nthey certainly were not wanting in intelligence ; and they were not, any of\nthem, prepossessed in favour of White. But they each admitted that they\ncould discover no possible explanation of the disturbances, and were fairly\nbewildered by the whole matter.\nStatement of Joe White. A fair witness. I think that he always\nintended to speak the truth, but that occasionally his memory proved\ntreacherous. In all importants points, however, he was corroborated\nby his wife (an excellent wituess), Higgs, and Currass. \u2014F. P.\nI returned home about 7 on the Friday night (March 2nd). I had been\nabsent from home on Monday and Tuesday nights : and it was during my\nabsence that my wife took in the girl Rose, who shared her bed in the front\ninner room. I slept at home on Wednesday, and the girl then slept on the\nsquab in the kitchen. I left again on Thursday morning, and returned as\nmentioned on the Friday.\nWhen told by my wife and Tom what had happened on Thursday night, I\nsaid some one must have been tricking, and didn't think much more about\nit. But I chaffed the lass (Rose) a good deal, for she was much frightened.\nAbout 11.30 on Friday evening, when my wife, the girl, and I were alone\nin the kitchen, just going up to bed, I heard a noise as if some one had\ncome down the passage between the two houses, and were standing just\noutside our door. They didn't knock; but I said to Rose, \"Go and see\nwho's there.\" But she was frightened and didn't go. Then presently, a\nlot of things came rattling down the stairs. I don't know what came first :\nbut a lot of things came\u2014a surcingle, bits of carpet, knives and forks, a\ncorkscrew, &c. The girl went to pick them up, and put them on the table,\nand just as fast as she put them on more things came down. Then my wife\nsaid to me, \" The salt cellar came down last night, but you won't have it\ndown to-night, for here it is on the table. \" She was using it at the time for\nsalting Tom's dinner for next day. She had hardly said this, when the salt\ncellar flew off from the table, and into the corner near the outer door. Rose\nwas in that corner, and not near the table : my wife was at the table, but\ncertainly didn't touch the cellar. I saw the thing go, though I couldn't\nbelieve my eyes. My wife didn't see it go, but we both saw it as it\nstruck the wall in the corner. All the salt was spilled out of it. I fairly couldn't\nbelieve my own eyes ; but I couldn't help thinking it must be Tom. So I\nwent upstairs to him, and told him to leave off. \" Thou'lt frighten our\nLiz to death.\" He said, \"It's not me, Joe. I'll take my oath it isn't. I've\nnever thrown nowt down. \" Whilst I was still talking to him, I heard a.\ncrash downstairs ; and the women screamed; and my wife cried, \"Come\ndown, Joe.\" As I was just coming into the room the candle which I held in\nmy hand went out\u2014I don't know how at all\u2014and we were left in darkness,\nexcept for the firelight. Then something hit me on the forehead, and I\ncried out, ' ' Who threw that ? \" Then there was a crash in the corner. I\nfound out when we had a light again that the salt cellar had fallen again into\nthe corner, and broken itself. Then I found out that the candle was not in the\ncandlestick, and asked where it was. I told the girl to look for it, and then\n\fPoltergeists. 53\nshe felt among the things at the bottom of the stairs and picked up three\ncandles, two of them quite new. We had only had two candles in the house\n[Mrs. White expressly confirmed this. \u2014F.P.] which had been bought just\nbefore, and both had been partly burnt. I lit the old ones and left the new\nones on the table ; but they disappeared afterwards, and I have never seen\nthem since.\nWhen the candle was lit again, I saw the little china woman jump off\nfrom the mantelpiece, and go into the same corner. It fell on its side, and\nthen righted itself, and stood upright, unbroken. I distinctly saw it go\nthrough the air ; it passed near me as I stood about the middle of the room.\nNone of us were near the mantelpiece. I picked it up, and presently it fell\ninto the corner again, and broke itself. Then the tea-caddy and the candle\nstick, all from the mantelpiece, followed. Then I went out and found\nGeorge Ford (\" Buck \" Ford), and asked him to fetch Dr. Lloyd for the\nchild\u2014for they had told me that all this disturbance meant the death of the\nchild, who was very ill with an abscess in its back.\nThen I got my wife to take the little lad out, and lay him next door, he\nlying on the squab in the kitchen at the time. [Mrs. W. denied this, and\nsaid he was in the inner room.\u2014F. P.] Rose went with her, and they took\nall the children with them. Before going, Rose had to go into the inner\nroom, and then things began to fly about there and make a disturbance. All\nhad been quiet there before.\nI went after the others into the next house and stayed there some little\ntime. When I came back, I found Police-constable Higgs in the kitchen.\nHe and I were alone there. (Rose all this time was next door.) We heard\na crash in the inner room, and we went in\u2014Solomon Wass and Tom, who\nhad just entered, with us, and Higgs with his lantern,\u2014and we found the\nchest of drawers turned up on end, and the lustres and looking-glass, and\neverything else that had been on it, in pieces on the floor. Then we came\nback into the kitchen, and we saw the cupboard door open, and a big glass\njar flew out, and flew into the yard and broke itself. Also some things\nflew off the bin at the side of the door, from the end near the fire ; and they\npitched in the corner, and then went out in the yard. Things often pitched\non the floor by the door first, and then got up again and flew out into the\nyard.\nThen Dr. Lloyd came in with my wife, and Higgs showed him what had\nhappened in the inner room. Then when we had got into the kitchen again,\nand were all standing near the door of the inner room\u2014Higgs, my wife, and\nTom, and Wass, and Lloyd\u2014who was about six feet from the bin, and the\nnearest to it of our party\u2014we all saw a basin which was lying on the bin\nnear the door, get up two or three times in the air, rising slowly a few\ninches or perhaps a foot, and then falling plump. [Mrs. W. corroborated\nthis, and so did Mr. Wass, the next-door neighbour, who was also present.\n\u2014F. P.] Then it got up higher, and went slowly, wobbling as it went, up\nto the ceiling, and when it reached the ceiling, it fell down all at once, and\nbroke itself.1 Dr. Lloyd then looked in the bin, saying the devil must be\n1 During this scene the room was lighted by one candle, Higgs's lantern, and\na blazing fire ; so that the light was pretty good.\n\f54 Frank Podmore.\nin the house, and then left. All the others shortly afterwards left, Mrs. W. ,\nRose and the children stopping in the next house. Tom and I sat in the\nchair on either side of the fire until the next morning at 8 a.m. Things\nkept on moving every now and then until about 2 a.m., and then was all\nquiet, and we got to sleep a bit. At about 8 a.m. I had to go out to see\nafter a pig which had been pigging, and then things began again ; and a lot of\nfolks came in to see about it. Currass came in, and I went with him into\nthe inner room and showed him the chest of drawers, he and I alone ; we\ncame out leaving the door open\u2014I am quite sure it was open\u2014and I was\nsitting near the fire, and Currass was just inside the kitchen, not far from\nthe open door, when Wass's little lad, who was sitting at the table, said,\n\"There's the clock striking,\" meaning the big clock which hung over our\nbed. I couldn't hear it, and I said it was a lie. Just then we heard a crash,\nand I asked what it was, and Currass looked round, and said it was the\nAmerican clock had fallen right across the bed, and lay on the floor at the\nfoot, with its bottom knocked out. Then I took it into the yard. I think\u2014\nindeed, I am sure, that Coulter was not here when all this happened. The other\nclock fell and was broken, but whether before or after I cannot remember ;\nand he may have seen that. I don't remember where the girl Rose was\nwhen the American clock fell. She may have been in the kitchen, but she\ncertainly wasn't in the inner room ; no one was in that room, I am sure. I\ndon't remember saying just at that time, though I often did say, that\nwherever she went the things smashed.\nAfter that, Currass and I and one or two others were standing near to\nthe outer door talking, when the china dogs, or one of them, flew off the\nmantelpiece and smashed ; and lots of things kept on flying into the corner\nand smashing. I saw one of the dogs leave the mantelpiece and go through\nthe air. I don't remember exactly when Coulter came ; he may have been\nhere when the china dog was smashed, but I don't remember that he was.\nThen a cream jug fell off the table ; it had done so four or five times without\nsmashing. At last I filled it with milk, and had placed it on the bin, when\nit suddenly fell off and smashed, and the milk was all spilt.\nThen I was tired, and lay down on the squab ; but things kept moving.\nI was told some pictures on the wall began to move, but I didn't see them.\nAt about 2 p. m. , a Salvation Army woman came in and was talking to me as\nI lay on the squab ; she stood near the inner door ; Rose was near the outer\ndoor, having brought in some carpet. There were two candlesticks on the\nbin, at the end near the fireplace. Suddenly something dropped behind the\nSalvation Army woman. No one saw it going through the air ; but we\nturned round and found that it was one of the brass candlesticks. It was\nhalf balanced on the small end where the candle goes, and was wobbling\nabout on the end. Then the Salvation woman said, \"I must go ;\" and\nshe went.\nThen a little after, when Rose was going to lay down the carpet, and no\none else in the room, a medicine bottle, full, fell from the bin on to the roll\nof carpet, about three or four yards off, and was broken. A lamp-glass had\nfallen several times without breaking ; but at last that fell and broke. Then\nan empty bottle flew off from the mantelpiece. That was one of the last\nthings that happened. Well then, I couldn't stand it any longer. Wherever\n\fPoltergeists. 55\nthe lass seemed to go, things seemed to fly about. So I said to her, \" You'll\nhave to go.\" She began to roar. But my wife gave her some tea, and she\nwent. That was between 4 and 5 p.m., very soon after the last disturbance.\nNothing happened after she left. We sat up in the kitchen that evening, a\nlot of us, as the newspapers tell ; but nothing happened at all.\nI have been in the house three years. I think the house had been built\nfour or five years before that. Nothing of the kind had ever happened in it\nbefore, as far as I know, except that once I thought I heard some one moving\nin the yard, and fancied it might be some one after the fowls ; but there was\nno one there ; and there was that strange tilting of the table when my wife\nwas washing up the things about a week before.\nThe Wasses and the Willises [Mrs. Willis is Wass's sister] had lived\ntogether in the next house ; but since all these disturbances, the Willises\nhave left the house ; but Mr. and Mrs. Wass are still there.\n(Signed) Joseph White.\nNew Building Ground, Worksop.\nApril 8th, 1883.\nStatement of Police Constable Higgs. A man of good intelligence, and\nbelieved to be entirely honest. Fully alive, as becomes his official\nposition, to White's indifferent reputation, but unable to account for\nwhat he saw.\u2014F.P.\nOn the night of Friday, March 2nd, I heard of the disturbances at Joe\nWhite's house from his young brother, Tom. I went round to the house at\n11.55 p.m., as near as I can judge, and found Joe White in the kitchen of\nhis house. There was one candle lighted in the room, and a good fire burn\ning, so that one could see things pretty clearly. The cupboard doors were\nopen, and White went and shut them, and then came and stood against\nthe chest of drawers. I stood near the outer door. No one else was in the\nroom at the time. White had hardly shut the cupboard doors when they\nflew open, and a large glass jar came out past me, and pitched in the yard\noutside, smashing itself. I didn't see the jar leave the cupboard, or fly\nthrough the air ; it went too quick. But I am quite sure that it wasn't\nthrown by White or any one else. White couldn't have done it without my\nseeing him. The jar couldn't go in a straight line from the cupboard out of\nthe door ; but it certainly did go.\nThen White asked me to come and see the things which had been smashed\nin the inner room. He led the way and I followed. As I passed the chest\nof drawers in the kitchen I noticed a tumbler standing on it. Just after I\npassed I heard a crash, and looking round, I saw that the tumbler had fallen\non the ground in the direction of the fireplace, and was broken. T don't\nknow how it happened. There was no one else in the room.\nI went into the inner room, and saw the bits of pots and things on the\nfloor, and then I came back with White into the kitchen. The girl Rose had\ncome into the kitchen during our absence. She was standing with her back\nagainst the bin near the fire. There was a cup standing on the bin, rather\nnearer the door. She said to me, \" Cup'11 go soon ; it has been down three\ntimes already.\" She then pushed it a little farther on the bin, and turned\nround and stood talking to me by the fire. She had hardly done so, when\n\f56 Frank Podmore.\nthe cup jumped up suddenly about four or five feet into the air, and then fell\non the floor and smashed itself. White was sitting on the other side of\nthe fire.\nThen Mrs. White came in with Dr. Lloyd ; also Tom White and Solomon\nWass. After they had been in two or three minutes, something else\nhappened. Tom White and Wass were standing with their backs to the\nfire, just in front of it. Eliza Rose and Dr. Lloyd were near them, with\ntheir backs turned towards the bin, the Doctor nearer to the door. I stood\nby the drawers, and Mrs. White was by me near the inner door. Then\nsuddenly a basin, which stood on the end of the bin near the door, got up\ninto the air, turning over and over as it went. It went up not very quickly,\nnot as quickly as if it had been thrown. When it reached the ceiling it fell\nplump and smashed. I called Dr. Lloyd's attention to it, and we all saw it.\nNo one was near it, and I don't know how it happened. I stayed about ten\nminutes more, but saw nothing else. I don't know what to make of it all.\nI don't think White or the girl could possibly have done the things which\nI saw.\n(Signed) William Hiqgs, G.E. 30.\nApril 10th, 1883.\nStatement of Arthur Currass, coal-miner ; a Methodist, and apparently\na very steady, respectable man. Believed that White did it, but\ncouldn't guess how it was done.\u2014F.P.\nI had to go out on the Saturday morning (March 3rd) to get some swill\nfor the pig, about 8.15 a.m. I passed by White's house, and hearing a\ndisturbance, I looked over the railings, and White said to me, \"There's\nsomething in the house that's breaking all afore it.\" I asked him what it were,\nand he told me to come and see. I got over the railings, and I followed\nWhite into his own house. He took me into the front place where the clock\nwas hanging over the bed's head, and was showing me a nest of drawers,\nwhere his suit of clothes came out of the bottom drawer into the top one but\none. While I was looking at the drawer, and the broken pots there was\nlying there, the clock by some means came from the wall, slantingwise about\nseven feet, and dropped clear of the bed's foot on to the floor. It had been\nfastened up on the wall, near the bed's head, and it fell between the bed's\nfoot and the door. I said, \" What is that?\" White said, \" It's something\nelse smashed. \" I turned round and saw that it was the clock. The nail still\nremained in the wall. The girl Rose was coming out of the kitchen towards\nthe inner door, but had not got quite up to it. She seemed to be much\nfrightened. White said to me, \"It doesn't matter a damn where that lass\ngoes, there's something smashes.\" The clock was taken right away into the\nyard and placed on an empty cask, and there it stayed. White and I were\nalone in the front room when the clock fell. White and I then went into\nthe back kitchen, and I remained about four feet from the outer door, with\nmy face towards the fireplace. I then saw a pot dog leap from the mantel\npiece, and come within about five feet of the pantry door and break, passing\nclose to me. There was nothing attached to it, and there was no one near it.\nI then began to move away, and just then Coulter appeared. This would be\nbetween 8.30 and 8.45 a.m. Coulter had not come before whilst I was there,\n\fPoltergeists. 57\nand certainly had not been present when the clock and the dog were broken.\nThe clock was in the yard when he came, and I showed it him there.\nJohn Street, Worksop, (Signed) Arthur Currass.\nApril 8th, 1883.\nI have given the evidence in this instance at considerable,\u2014-perhaps\ntedious,\u2014length, because, of all the cases which have been investigated\nby representatives of the Society, it is, as it stands, one of the most\ndifficult to harmonise with any explanation by ordinary material causes.\nThe concordant testimony of so many honest and fairly intelligent\npersons certainly produced, as will have been seen from my report, a\nstrong impression on my mind at the time. Nor do I see reason now\nto question my original estimate of their intelligence and good faith.\nIf my verdict on the Worksop disturbances in 1896 differs from that\nwhich I gave in 1883, it is because many things have happened since,\nwhich have taught us to discount testimony in matters of this kind.\nFor it will be seen that the value of these reports, as testifying\nto the operation of some supernormal agency, depends wholly upon two\nassumptions, first, that the various witnesses\u2014imperfectly educated\npersons, not skilled in accurate observation of any kind\u2014correctly\ndescribed what they saw : and, second, that after an interval of more\nthan five weeks, during which time the experiences had been discussed\nand compared and gaped at by every village fireside, and in the\npublic press, they correctly remembered what they described. But\nin the course of the 13 years which have passed since I wrote my\nreport, we have received some striking object-lessons demonstrating\nthe incapacity of the ordinary unskilled observer to detect trickery\nor sleight-of-hand : and we have learnt to distrust the accuracy of\nthe unaided memory in recording feats of this kind, especially when,\nperformed under circumstances of considerable excitement.\nAnd, indeed, if we scrutinise the account as it stands, we shall\nfind various discrepancies and contradictions in the evidence. (1) Thus,\naccording to White, Higgs and he went into the front room first, to\nsee the damage done there, and on their return to the kitchen a glass\njar flew out of the cupboard. But according to Higgs' version, it was\nafter seeing the glass jar fly through the air that White and he went\ninto the inner room. (2) White's account is that two or three\nwitnesses were present when the glass jar flew out ; Higgs says, \" that\nno one else was in the room at the time.\" (3) There seems to be a\ndoubt as to whether Rose entered the kitchen during Higgs' visit.\nWhite does not mention her entrance at all. Higgs says they found her\nin the kitchen on their return from the inner room. (4) Currass says\nhe was in the inner room on the morning of the 3rd when the clock fell.\nWhite says that Currass was in the kitchen. (5) Again, White cannot\n\f58 Frank Podmore.\nremember where Rose was at the time of the incident ; whilst Currass\nsays that she was near the inner door. (6) White and Currass agree\nthat Coulter was not present when the American clock fell and was\nsmashed. Now Coulter, whom I saw, and who impressed me favourably\nas an honest man, stated that he was present when the clock fell, and\nalso during the immediately succeeding disturbances in the kitchen.1\nSuch are some of the discrepancies which appear in the evidence\neven as prepared and taken down from the lips of the witnesses by a\ntoo sympathetic reporter. It is probable that more and more serious\ndiscrepancies and contradictions would have been found if there had\nbeen no speculation and consultation and comparison in the interval of\nfive weeks ; and if each witness at the end of that time had written\nan independent account of the incidents.\nIt would be idle, in the circumstances and at this distance, to\nspeculate on the real cause of these disturbances. But it is to be noted\nthat Eliza Rose\u2014the daughter of an imbecile mother\u2014was present, by\nall accounts, at most of the disturbances ; that they began shortly after\nher entrance to the cottage and ceased with her departure ; and that she\nwas regarded by White himself as the prime cause of all that happened.\nAnd if one apparently honest witness could describe himself as having\nseen occurrences that he knew of only by hearsay ; if others could be\nmistaken as to the sequence of important events, and the presence or\nabsence at given times of particular persons ; it is perhaps not\nunreasonable to conjecture that the statements made by White and\nothers that some abnormal movements took place during Rose's\nabsence may have been incorrect, and that Rose herself, as the\ninstrument of mysterious agencies, or simply as a half-witted girl\ngifted with abnormal cunning and love of mischief, may have been\ndirectly responsible for all that took place.\nIn the next case we have clear evidence that some, at least, of the\nphenomena which puzzled those who witnessed them, and gave rise to\nsuspicions of preternatural agency, were due simply to sleight-of-hand on\nthe part of a young uneducated village girl.\nII.\u2014The Wem Case.\nThe subjoined extract from a daily paper gives an account of some\nmysterious disturbances at a Shropshire village, in November, 1883.\n\" A series of occurrences which have caused great excitement in the\nneighbourhood of Leebotwood, and no small speculation and wonder in the\n1 Coulter's evidence was omitted from the account given in the text, originally\nprinted in the Journal of the Society, as I did not at the time sufficiently realise its\nimportance, and came to the conclusion that the man was telling a deliberate\nfalsehood.\n\fPoltergeists. 59\nadjacent town of Shrewsbury, have just taken place. At a secluded farm\ncalled ' The Woods, ' which is about a mile and a half from Toppington and\nnine or ten from Shrewsbury, resides a farmer named Hampson, and about\nfour o'clock one afternoon, at the latter end of last week, the servants were\nin the kitchen of the farmhouse, preparing tea. On the fire was a saucepan\nin which were some eggs boiling, and this 'jumped,' as the girls declared,\noff the fire, while the tea things were thrown from the table and smashed.\nSome of the hot cinders were also thrown out of the grate, and set fire to\nsome clothes in a basket. So far, the explosion of some material in the grate\nmight have been sufficient to account for the occurrence ; but what is said to\nhave occurred subsequently will not bear such an explanation. On the table\nwas a paraffin lamp, with a globe, and the globe was ' lifted ' off the stand\nand thrown across the room, the lamp itself being left on the table. A mat\nunder the lamp took fire, and the inmates of the house becoming alarmed,\nthen ran out for the neighbours. Among others who went to the house was\na Mr. Lea, an adjacent farmer, who states that when he approached the house\nit seemed as if all the upstairs rooms were on fire, ' as there was such a light\nin the windows. ' Mr. Hampson consequently went upstairs and made an\nexamination, but everything there was safe, and in the usual order. As\nthings were continuing to jump about the kitchen in a manner which was\naltogether inexplicable, and many were getting damaged, Hampson decided\nto remove everything that was in that apartment outside. He accordingly\ntook down a barometer from the wall, when something struck him on the\nleg, and a loaf of bread which was on the table was thrown by some\ninvisible means and hit him on the back. A volume of ' Pilgrim's Progress '\nwas thrown or 'jumped ' through the window, and a large ornamental\nsea-shell went through in a similar fashion. In the parlour a sewing machine\nwas thrown about and damaged, and has had to be sent to be repaired.\nThe nurse-girl was nursing the baby by the fire when some fire leapt from the\ngrate, and the child's hair was singed and its arms burnt. The girl was so\nalarmed that she set off to a neighbour's, and on the way there her clothes\ntook fire, and had to be torn from her body. During the evening, while the\ngirl was at the neighbour's, a plate which she touched while having her\nsupper was apparently thrown on the floor, and the pieces were picked up\nby some unseen agency, and put in the centre of the table. Other occur\nrences are said to have taken place in the neighbour's house while the nurse-\ngirl was there, the whole lasting considerably over half an hour. As no one\ncould explain the cause of what they witnessed, the police were communicated\nwith, and made full inquiries from the inmates of the house and others, the\nresult being that they ordered the coal to be consumed in the open air,\nbelieving it to contain some explosive substance, but it burnt quietly away.\nThose who witnessed these occurrences tell a marvellously straightforward\nstory, and curiously enough none of them attributed it to any supernatural\ncause, as might have been expected in a quiet country locality, but they say\nit was ' something in the coal or in the air, ' while one or two fancy it was\nsome electrical phenomena.\"\nSubsequently the same paper states their \"Shrewsbury correspondent\ntelegraphs that he paid another visit to Weston Lullingfield yesterday, and\nwas informed that on Saturday and Sunday there were more extraordinary\n\f60 Frank Podmore.\nmanifestations in connection with the girl Emma Davies. Police-constable\nTaylor, of the Shropshire Constabulary, remained in the house until late on\nSaturday. During the time he was there the fender moved from the fire\nplace into the middle of the room, and on being replaced, came forward a\nsecond and third time. A cushion placed at the back of a cliair on which the\ngirl sat several times flew across the room, and all the stitches in her apron\ncame undone, followed later on by the buttons upon her dress being\nwrenched off. Miss Maddox, the village schoolmistress, made a statement\nto the correspondent to the effect that she called to see the girl, a former\npupil, on Saturday evening, and had not long been seated when she observed\nboth the chair and the girl rise from the floor. She took the girl on her lap\nand sat in the chair herself, and immediately the girl's boots flew off, and\nalthough replaced, the circumstance was twice repeated. On Sunday a box\nin a bedroom was hurled across the room, and a number of cups and saucers\nwere smashed.\"\nReport by Mh. F. S. Hughes.\nDecember 3rd, 1883.\nDuring the first and second weeks of November, 1883, accounts were to\nbe seen in the London and local papers of strange phenomena stated to have\ntaken place at Wood's Farm, near Wem, and other houses in the neighbour\nhood.\nThese phenomena could not apparently be accounted for by ordinary\nphysical laws, and it seemed therefore very desirable that the stories\nshould be thoroughly sifted on behalf of the Society for Psychical\nResearch.\nThe scene of the first series of these phenomena was Wood's Farm,\nand the time, the afternoon of Thursday, November 1st. A nurse-girl at\nthe farm, named Emma Davies, was connected in some way with the\ndisturbances by the occupiers, and she was accordingly dismissed and sent\nto her home at a village called Weston Lullingfield, about five miles off.\nHere the singular phenomena appeared shortly after her arrival, and the\naffair began to attract very general attention.\nOn Friday, the 9th, the girl, who seems to have got into a very nervous\nstate, was taken to a branch establishment at Wem, of Dr. Corke, of\nBaschurch, and kept in strict seclusion, at the same time being closely\nwatched by the housekeeper, Miss Turner.\nOn the following Thursday the Daily News and the Daily Telegraph both\nhad long reports, stating that the girl had confessed to having wrought all\nthese wonders by very ordinary sleight-of-hand.\nAs, however, these accounts did little to explain away the phenomena\nwhich had taken place according to the previous newspaper reports, I was\nasked by the Society for Psychical Research to go down to Shropshire to\ninvestigate the evidence on which the original stories rested, and to see\nwhether they could really be accounted for satisfactorily by the girl's alleged\ntrickery.\nOn Saturday, the 17th November, I proceeded to Wem, and shortly after\nmy arrival called at the doctor's house, and saw Miss Turner, Dr. Mackey,\nthe assistant of Dr. Corke, not being at home.\n\fPoltergeists. 61\nMiss Turner is a lady of about 30 years of age, who appeared to be a\npractical, shrewd person, not at all excitable, and she gave her evidence in a\nvery straightforward manner.\nCalling again, later on in the evening, I saw Dr. Mackey, who is a young\nScotchman, of about 27 or 28, and who seemed nervously anxious not to give\nany evidence about which he had any doubt.\nI am quite confident that the girl was well treated while living with them,\nand was subjected to no undue influence.\nI made notes of the evidence they were able to give me on the subject,\nand obtained their signatures to my account after they had heard it read to\nthem.\nBriefly their account is :\u2014That certain manifestations took place, similar\nin character to those that preceded them, and for two or three days they\nwere quite unable to detect any fraud, though no manifestation ever took\nplace when the girl was not in such a position that she might have produced\nthem by ordinary trickery.\nThus, in the presence of Dr. Mackey and Miss Turner a piece of bread\njumped across the room, the girl not being actually seen to throw it. On\nanother occasion when Miss Turner had left the room, the girl suddenly\nscreamed, and when Miss T. returned, a pair of slippers were on the sofa\nwhich had just before been seen on the hearthrug. Again, when Miss T. had\njust turned her back to the girl, the usual scream was heard, and turning\nround Miss T. saw a bucket in the air descending to the ground. A knife\non another occasion was thrown across the room, being in the air when Dr.\nCorke's servant was entering the room.\nOn Tuesday morning, however, Miss Turner was in an upper room at\nthe back of the house, and the servant of the establishment and Emma\nDavies were outside, Emma having her back to the house, and unaware that\nshe was observed. Miss Turner noticed that Emma Davies had a piece of\nbrick in her hand held behind her back. This she threw to a distance by a\nturn of the wrist, and while doing so, screamed to attract the attention of\nthe servant, who, of course, turning round, saw the brick in the air, and\nwas very much frightened. Emma Davies, looking round, saw that she had\nbeen seen by Miss Turner, and apparently imagining that she had been\nfound out, was very anxious to return home that night.\nMiss Turner took no notice of the occurrence at the time, but the next\nmorning (Wednesday) she asked the girl if she had been playing tricks, and\nthe girl confessed that she had, and went through some of the performances\nvery skilfully, according to Miss Turner's account.\nLater on in the day she repeated these in the presence of the doctor,\nMiss Turner, and the two reporters from London, but Miss Turner said\nnothing like so well.\nDr. Mackey further gave me an account of a conversation which he had\nhad with Emma Davies, chiefly with reference to some of the extraordinary\nstories that had appeared in the papers.\nOne of these stories was that after the girl's return to her father's house,\nshe was in the habit of assisting her sister in household work. One day they\nwere putting clothes out on the hedge to dry, but those placed by Emma\nDavies refused to remain on the hedge, and \"jumped over into the road.\"\n\f02 Frank Podmore.\nWith reference to this, the statement of Emma Davies, as reported by\nDr. Mackey, was as follows : \"They put the clothes on the hedge, and then\nreturned to the house, nothing unusual having occurred. On going outside\nagain, the linen was found on the ground, two little boys being seen\nrunning away. \" She was quite confident that she did not see the things\ngoing off the hedge.\nSeveral of the other stories were similarly disposed of by her. Thus,\nwhen the windows were broken at her father's cottage and the farm, there\nwere a lot of men and boys standing about outside.\nThe girl always denied that she had produced the various phenomena at\nWood's Farm and Weston Lullingfield, but Dr. Mackey thought that she\nhad been carefully primed not to \"let on \" about this.\nDr. Mackey added that the girl's physical and mental condition was\nquite normal, so far as he could ascertain.\nOn the following morning I drove over to Wood's Farm, which is about\nfive or six miles distant from Wem, and there obtained the evidence of the\nfollowing witnesses :\u2014\nMr. and Mrs. Hampson, their servant girl, Priscilla Evans, Mr. and\nMrs. Lea, of a neighbouring farm, and the waggoner at Wood's Farm,\nThomas Williams.\nMr. Hampson was a very intelligent man, who unfortunately was not at\nhome at the time of the occurrences, and only had evidence on some minor\ndetails.\nMrs. Hampson was very diffuse in her account, and appeared rather\ncredulous. She looks about 30 years of age.\nThe girl, Priscilla Evans, is about 16, very voluble, but gave her\nevidence in a very straightforward manner, giving me the impression that\nshe was telling me what she believed to be the truth. She had an excellent\ncharacter from Mr. and Mrs. Hampson ; and it is mere justice to her to\nstate that the charge of complicity with Emma Davies' trickery, brought\nagainst her by the reporters of the Daily News and the Daily Telegraph\u2014on\nthe ground of a supposed confession of the waggoner Williams, that he\nhad taught his fellow servants ' ' how to shift things about \"\u2014completely\nbroke down under my examination. The waggoner denies that he ever said,\nor could have said, anything of the sort ; and his denial was entirely con\nfirmed by Mr. Belliss, the innkeeper, who drove the reporters over from\nWem, and himself suggested the questions put to the waggoner which led\nto the reporters' mistake.\nI could not regard Mr. and Mrs. Lea as good witnesses, since their firm\nconviction of the devil's agency in the matter rendered them too much\nindisposed to accept any ordinary explanation of any of the occurrences to\nwhich they referred, and they did not bring forward any cases of manifesta\ntions which took place when Emma Davies was undeniably, according to my\nopinion, in such a position that she could not have produced them.\nA rough drawing of the premises will show the relative position of the\nparlour, kitchen, and dairy, and will be useful in estimating the value of the\nevidence.\nAccording to Mrs. Hampson's account, the family, with the exception of\nMr. Hampson, were occupying the parlour on Wednesday, October 31st,\n\fPoltergeists. 63\n.when suddenly coal was seen to be \"alive\" in various parts of the room,\napparently having flown out of the fire. Nothing unusual was observed that\nday in addition to this, the fire having been removed to the kitchen, and\n\u00aboke instead of coal being employed.\nThe next day, about four p.m., the family were about to sit down to\ntea, when the saucepan on the fire jumped off, and coal began to fly about.\nA cup and saucer \"went off\" the table, by unseen agency, and they were\nall so frightened that E.D. was sent off to Lea's farm for help. Mrs. H.\nand Priscilla retreated to the dairy, whence, it will be seen on reference to\nthe map, they had a full view of the kitchen table. They both state that\nthey saw the crockery rise up off the table and fall to the ground. The\narticles did not go off all at once, but one or two at a time. They are quite\ncertain that this happened while Emma Davies was absent, fetching Mrs.\nLea from the neighbouring farm.\nH I H I\nM\na Entrance to house.\nB Dairy.\nC, E, F Doorways.\nD Cupboard.\nI Staircase leading to upper rooms.\nH H Windows.\nK Kitchen Table.\nKitchen.\nParlour.\nPlace where Evans was standing when the\ncrockery came out of the cupboard.\nemma Davies' position.\nIndicates the direction in whichthe crockery\ncame out of the cupboard.\nG\nL\nM\n.N\n\u25a0\/ H I\nSome of the crockery, on the return of Emma Davies and Mrs. Lea,\nwas placed on the table, but again went off. Mrs. Lea and Mrs. Hampson\nthen deemed it desirable to go for further assistance, the girls being left\nbehind. This ends Mrs. Hampson's evidence as regards the occurrences of\nthat evening at the farm.\nMrs. Hampson also stated that in the morning the baby was in its cradle\ninside the parlour, where it had been placed to be out of range of the fire.\nMrs. Hampson and the girls were in the kitchen, and E. D. went in to see\nafter the baby, returning presently, screaming, saying that the baby was on\nfire. On the various occasions (three or four) that the baby was on fire,\n\f64 Frank Podmore.\nE. D. was always the one to discover it ; and she always had time to cause\nthe fire, according to Mrs. Hampson. Once she was seen to be shaking the\nchild's pinafore, which was alight, although Mrs. H. had carefully warned\nher always to \"crush \" fire out.\nFurther, on one occasion when E. D. was alone in the parlour, during\nthe manifestations, a noise as of a striking match was heard, and when Mrs.\nH. entered the room, there was a distinct smell of brimstone, and a used\nmatch was found at the baby's head.\nPriscilla Evans added some information with regard to articles found\non fire, which was corroborated by Mr. Lea. Mrs. Hampson was not\npresent, I believe, when they were discovered.\nIt is well to note that E. D. was always the person to discover anything\non fire, and none of the witnesses could state positively that on any single\noccasion was she in the company or in sight of any one when she made the\ndiscovery.\nOne of the baby's caps, of a kind of woollen material, and a paper mat\nwere found in flames, the flames being very high and white, and the articles\napparently burning were very little singed when the flames were ex\ntinguished. The cap and mat, which had both been exposed to the air for\nsome time, were shown to me, and I cut off a bit of the cap, which I dipped\nin paraffin, which was largely used at the farm. Lighting it, she, Priscilla\nE., declared it presented exactly the appearance of the former blaze, and\nthe bit of cap was of course little singed, when the flame was extinguished.\nMr. Hampson stated that the cap, when shown to him on his return, had a\ngreasy feel.\nThe most important piece of evidence that the girl Evans contributed is,\nthat when Mrs. H. and Mrs. Lea had left the house, the cupboard opposite the\ndairy door was apparently locked by one of them, but afterwards flew open,\nwhereupon E. D., going to close it, became, as it were, rooted to the spot.\nPriscilla tried to pull her away, but the girl shrieked and said she couldn't-\nmove. The cupboard was well stocked with crockery, and these things pro\nceeded to come out of the cupboard two or three at a time, generally in the\ndirection shown by the arrow in the diagram. The girls occupied the positions\nindicated in the same diagram. Priscilla states that E. D. had her arms\nfolded all the time, and that she, Priscilla, watched her closely, and was\ncertain that she did not pull the things out. I should, however, point out\nthat it must have been nearly dark at the time.\nWith regard to the statement that E. D. was put up to these tricks by\nthe waggoner, there appears\u2014as I have already said\u2014no evidence for this,\nand it is almost absurd to suppose a heavy rustic capable of giving lessons\nin legerdemain.\nPriscilla and E. D. appear to have been on rather bad terms, and none\nof the people at the farm gave E. D. a good character.\nContinuing my journey I arrived at Weston Lullingfield, a village\nabout five miles from Wood's Farm. I first called on Miss Maddox, a,\nwoman of about 40, who had been training the youth of Weston for\nthe last 12 years (\"come December\"). She is rather excitable, and a\nwoman who would, I think, be easily imposed upon. Her evidence is a\n\fPoltergeists. 65\nremarkable illustration of the manner in which the sensational newspaper\nreports dwindle down into the commonplace.\nShe states that when she visited the girl, there were about 20 people\nstanding and sitting about the room, and the girl E. D. was wriggling about\non her chair in a state of great excitement. Miss M. is positive that the\nchair rose off the ground about a foot, but this I imagine a clever child\ncould accomplish by a clever \" kick off.\"\nMiss M. then took the child on her lap, and the child's boots flew off,\nbut whether they were securely fastened on her feet, or downtrodden at\nthe heels, she cannot say.\nThe only further evidence that Miss M. had on the subject was that she\nsaw a table (up against a wooden partition) moving up and down rather\nviolently, without, she thought, any one being near. She added that the\npartition seemed \"bulged in,\" so that somebody might have been pushing\nit on the other side of the partition.\nShe gave E. D. a good character.\nI then visited the girl's home, but could not see the girl. The father,\nhowever, came out and spoke to me, but he himself had seen nothing.\nThe rustics of the village, whom I afterwards interviewed, were nearly\nall unable to sign their names, and their evidence is hardly worth recording.\nOne man, who was present with Police-constable Taylor when the fender\nperformed feats, states that Taylor was sitting on one side of the fire, and\nE. D. on the other, but he could not say how the fender \"came forward,\"\nwhether parallel to itself, or only in such a manner that the girl might have\npushed it out with her foot.\nAll the other evidence at this place was of the same unsatisfactory\nnature.\nThe next day I drove over with Mr. Maitland to try and see Emma\nDavies, but she would not speak, and was taken upstairs. After the lapse\nof an hour she reappeared, but we could not get anything out of her.\nSumming up, I consider that there is abundant evidence of some\ntrickery on the part of the girl E. D. , at Wood's Farm ; but that some\nportion of the phenomena cannot be referred to this cause if the statements\nof Mrs. Hampson and Priscilla Evans as to what occurred in E. D.'s\nabsence, and the description given by Priscilla Evans of the crockery\ncoming out of the cupboard, can be at all relied on. Still, if the case were\nan isolated one, the evidence is not of so satisfactory a nature as to justify\nthe assumption that phenomena unexplainable by trickery actually took\nplace ; but on the hypothesis that there are cases on record in which\ntrickery and genuine preternatural phenomena were combined, this case\nmight, with some degree of probability, be included amongst them.\nFrank S. Hughes, B.A. (Cantab).\nDecember 3rd, 1883.\nAs exception has been taken to Mr. Hughes' treatment of part of\nthe evidence in this case, on the ground that he was biassed against a\nbelief in supernormal agencies, it seems best to quote textually the two\npassages specially referred to.\nF\n\f66 Frank Podmore.\n(1) The signed statement by Miss Maddox gives the following\nversion of the \" levitation \" :\u2014\" There were about 20 people standing\nand sitting about the room when Miss Maddox entered. The first\nthing Miss Maddox saw was the chair on which the girl sat wriggling\nabout, and once rising a foot from the ground, the girl having no point\nof contact with the ground at the time. She was writhing about, and\nin a state of great nervous excitement.\"\n(2) The following passage is from a statement signed by Henry and\nJames Lea :\u2014\" Emma Davies was with Mrs. Lea at the gate, a long\ndistance off, while the noises continued and things came flying out of the\nwindow. Things came out after the place had been cleared of people.\"\nIt will be admitted, I think, that the conditions described by Miss\nMaddox\u2014some twenty people present in the room, and Emma Davies\ntwisting and wriggling on her chair in a condition of great nervous\nexcitement\u2014were not specially favourable for observation. It may be\nadded that under more favourable circumstances a phenomenon of the\nkind which Miss Maddox claims to have witnessed is not easy to\nobserve with accuracy. As regards the Leas' statement that Emma\nDavies was at a distance from the house during the progress of some of\nthe disturbances, it will be remembered that in the Worksop case it was\nshown that memory is apt to be treacherous on such matters as the\npresence or absence of particular persons at particular times, and the\nprecise sequence of various events. A statement of this kind would no\ndoubt be deserving of consideration if it emanated from a first-rate\nwitness. But Mr. Hughes' estimate of the Leas as being indifferent\nwitnesses must be allowed to have weight.\nUpon the whole, after a reperusal of the documents in the case, I\ncannot find that Mr. Hughes has misrepresented the evidence in any\nmaterial particular. As regards the two incidents upon which he lays\nspecial stress, it may be considered that if Emma Davies was able to\nevade detection when closely watched for two or three days by\nsuspicious and educated witnesses, it seems not unlikely that she\nmight have succeeded in the easier task of eluding the vigilance of\nPriscilla Evans, a young rustic already mystified and excited by the\nmarvellous manifestations which she had witnessed, and that the\ncrockery which flew out of the cupboard in the twilight was merely\npropelled by the hand of Emma Davies. There remains the statement\nof two witnesses who saw crockery fall off the table during Emma\nDavies' absence. This statement, if accepted literally, is hard to\nreconcile with the supposition of trickery. But we have no reason to\nsuppose that Priscilla Evans and Mrs. Hampson were better observers\nthan some of the persons who sat at stances with Mr. Eglinton, or\nwere able to remember and describe what they saw with greater\naccuracy than the witnesses of Mr. Davey's sleight-of-hand.\n\fPoltergeists. 67\nIt should be added that though Emma Davies was regarded by the\ndoctor who examined her as being quite normal, Mr. Hughes, in the\ncourse of his enquiries, found some evidence of unusual precocity\non her part. Moreover, according to her mother's statement, while she\nhad been a healthy child before the outbreak of the disturbances, she\nafterwards fell into ill-health and became subject to fits. It should be\nadded that Miss Maddox in her signed account states that, during\nsome of the disturbances at which she was present, Emma Davies\ncried out that an old woman was at her, and would not let her breathe,\nand called to her mother to relieve her.\nIII.\u2014The Arundel Case.\nThe next account, by Major (now Lieutenant-Colonel) Taylor, deals\nwith disturbances which took place in February, 1884.\n.Report on the Alleged Manifestations at Arundel, Sussex. By\n\u25a0 Major G. L. Le M. Taylor, Royal Military College, Famborough\nStation, Hants.\nAccompanied by Major King, R.M.A., I arrived at Arundel on Saturday,\nFebruary 22nd, to enquire into the circumstances attending the alleged\nmanifestations in connection with the girl Clark.\nWe first visited Mr. Hubbert, F.R.C.S., the medical man who had been\ncalled in to see the girl when the affair commenced ; he very kindly told us\nwhat took place, his statement being in effect as follows :\u2014\nHe was called in about 10.30 on the night of February 8th, to see the\ngirl Clark, who was said to be \"bewitched\" ; he found the household in\ngreat consternation, and persuaded that a neighbour had \" bewitched \" her.\nHe asked what the symptoms were, and was told that \"scratchings \" took\nplace \"all about the bed\" on which the girl was, that she did not make\nthem, and that they were supernatural ; he was told to listen, and shortly\nhe heard a noise in the bedroom above, as if made by scratching the\nmattress with the nails of the hand. On going upstairs he found the girl\nin bed, and asked her \" How she did it 1 \" or \" Why she did it 'I \" but she\nsaid she had nothing to do with it. While he was in the room nothing took\nplace, but he was told that if he left the room the noise would probably\nrecommence. He did so, and again the scratchings were heard. He went\nback into the room with the girl alone, and having taken hold of her hands\nwith one of his, he scratched the mattress with the other. The noise was\nat once recognised by the family outside the door as the same previously\nheard. The doctor now tied the girl's hands in such a way as to prevent\nthe use of the nails, and left the room. The noise was soon repeated, but\nwas now more like rubbing than scratching. In fact, the sound seemed\nmuffled. Again he tied the girl's hands more securely, and balanced a\nwoollen cuff on them, outside the bed clothes. Now no noise was heard for\nsome time, and on re-entering the room the cuff was found unmoved. The\ndoctor was satisfied that the noises were made by the girl herself. He then\nleft and has had nothing more to do with the affair.\nF 2\n\f68 Frank Podmore.\nWe next went to Clark's house, and found that, unfortunately, the girl's\nfather was away, and the girl herself had been sent to Brighton. We saw,\nhowever, the girl's mother and her father's mother.\nThe mother is a large, flabby, sallow woman of about 40, with a narrow\nforehead and rather oblique eye-brows. She did not seem in good health,\nand was certainly nervous and frightened at the whole affair. Mr. Hubbert\ndescribed her as hysterical. The grandmother is an old woman, who was not\nat all frightened at what had taken place, but rather liked talking about it.\nThe impression we received as to the evidence of these women was that\nthey were perfectly honest witnesses, believing everything they told us ;\nthe mother being unwilling to speak of them at all, and particularly careful\nnot to speak to anything which had not come within her own knowledge.\nThe grandmother, though equally honest, had evidently told the story so\noften that she described things which, on her own showing, she could not\nhave seen.\nWe gathered that the \"manifestations\" began on Friday evening,\nFebruary 8th, and the girl was sent away on Tuesday or Wednesday, the\n19th or 20th, and that nothing took place between Tuesday, the 12th, and\nMonday, the 18th, on which day the girl is said to have seen an apparition,\nwhich determined her people to send her to Brighton. Our two witnesses\nwere able to speak directly to only some of the alleged manifestations, the\nevidence for the others resting on the testimony of the girl, her father, the\ngirl's maternal grandmother, and a neighbour. The manifestations appear\nto have begun spontaneously ; but afterwards to have been in a great\nmeasure sought by the father to test their reality. We ascertained pretty\nwell in what order the different things happened, but could not quite make\nit clear on which days they occurred.\nI will give first the substance of the statements of the two women we\nsaw, as far as they speak from their own knowledge ; and then the re\nmainder of the story as gathered from the grandmother, but the direct\nevidence for which could not be obtained.\nThe mother states that the girl is 13, but looks older ; is a good, quiet\ngirl, about whose honesty in the present matter she has no doubt. (Major\nKing saw the girl's photograph ; it was of a girl with a sharp and rather\nshrewd face.) That on Friday night, a minute or two after getting into bed\nwith her two girls (her husband being away at work), she heard a scratching\nnoise on the mattress of the bed. She asked the girls if they were making\nit. They said, \"No,\" and seemed frightened. She hold the girl's hands,\nand yet the noise continued. She got out of bed, thinking it might be rats,\nlit a candle, searched the room, and re-made the bed. When they went to\nbed again the noise recommenced. She then went into the back room, but\nthe noise continued on the other bed. She also states that the first bed\nheaved up, and that, when they went into the second room, the bed and\neverything in the room shook. She got so frightened that she sent for the\ndoctor.\nThough the mother sat by and acquiesced in all her mother-in-law sub\nsequently related, she said nothing more than the above came under her\nspecial knowledge, except the evident distress of her daughter on other\noccasions.\n\fPoltergeists. 69\nThe grandmother corroborated what the mother stated about the girl's\ngoodness and honesty, and proceeded to say that when the father returned\non Saturday night (?) some attempts were made at an investigation, in the\ncourse of which the girl was sent upstairs into the room in which the noises\nwere first observed, \" to see what would happen.\" She was followed by her\ntwo grandmothers (the maternal grandmother, who lived in another village,\nhaving been sent for previously). The girl stood at A (see plan), in full\nview of the old women, who were at the head of the stairs, when in a\nminute three articles fell to the ground at the other end of the room at B\nand C, a clock from off the chest of drawers, and two ornaments from the\nchimney-piece, all at the same time. The girl rushed back to the stairs,\nand the two old women, going into the room, found the things on the floor,\nbut not broken ; there was a mat or carpet where they fell. They replaced\nthe things, the clock on its back far back on the drawers. They again fell\nunder similar circumstances (?) ; the girl described them to have turned over\nand over till they reached the floor. One of the things that fell was a small\nbell-shaped shade over a match stand.\nAfter the above incident (on Sunday, I think), the girl was sent to her\ngrandmother's house, not far off, \"to see if anything would happen in a\nnew place.\" The grandmother says that, when there and in view, things\njumped up and fell down which were out of the girl's reach. I could not\nget a clear statement about it, but got the old woman to acknowledge that\nshe saw nothing fall.\nLater, again, the grandmother declares that when going upstairs in her\nson's house, with the girl in front of her, a dark cloud seemed to meet\nthem and obscure the light of the candle till she lost sight of the child,\nPLAN OF cLaRK'S HOUSe.\u20141st FLOOr PLaN.\n\fFrank Podmore.\nPLaN OF cLaRK'S HOUSE.\u2014GROUND PLaN.\n\fPoltergeists. 71\nwho shrank back to her, and said she felt it all over her ; the cloud soon\npassed away.\nAs for the rest of the story, it appears that the father sent the girl into\nthe scullery, and watched through the door a tray of potatoes and an iron\npot fall ; they were, however, scarcely beyond the girl's reach. This\nexperiment appears to have been repeated, for on another occasion a neigh\nbour, looking through the door, said he saw a shadowy hand stretched out\nfrom the girl to the things to upset them. On another occasion the girl,\nhaving been sent across the road to the baker's, returned with the story that\nimmediately she entered the shop two chairs fell over of themselves, but \u00bb\nno one else saw them fall.\nAgain, the girl is said to have been alone with her maternal grand\nmother (whom we did not see) in the lower front room, and being told to\nget some coal, the child opened the door at D. At this moment the grand\nmother and girl heard three violent knocks on table E. The girl got\nfrightened, and the grandmother went with her to get the coal from under\nthe stairs. Again three knocks were heard on the stairs.\nAfter this it seems the girl never left her mother's side for a week,\nand nothing took place. At the end of that time her mother, thinking\nthat perhaps it was all over, sent the girl upstairs to get a dress from the\nback bedroom. On entering the room the child screamed, and on her\nreturn stated to her mother that she had seen at F a figure in a white dress,\nwith fingers very white and long, bald head, and white eyes and feet, which,\nwhen she screamed, receded and disappeared into the wall behind it.\nThe order in which the manifestations are said to have followed one\nanother is as follows :\u2014\nOrder or Manifestations. Observed By.\n1. Scratchings Mother, Sister, and Doctor\n2. Ditto Mother, Sister, and Paternal Grandmother\n3. Things falling Paternal Grandmother and Maternal Grandmother\n4.

Apparition Child\nObservations.\nNos. 1 and 2.\u2014The doctor being quite unaffected by any feeling of\nexcitement or fear, which was not the case with the family, was the best\njudge of the cause of these manifestations. He was convinced that they\nwere caused by the child herself.\nNos. 3 and 4. \u2014If the evidence of the paternal grandmother could be\nrelied on, these could not, in my opinion, be accounted for by any physical\ncause, as the clock and ornaments fell simultaneously and were 9ft. from\nthe girl, who, having been sent by her father without warning (as I under\nstood) to the room above stairs, had no opportunity of making any arrange\nments for trickery.\n\f78 Frank Podmore.\nNo. 5.\u2014In these manifestations the girl might not have been more than\n4ft. from the things which fell, and the hole in the door (as tested by me) is\nso small that little can be seen through it, and that little in a shadowy way.\nNo. 6.\u2014The girl standing where she did when the knocks \"on the-\ntable \" were heard, was within reach of the door of the coal-hole, knocks-\non which (as ascertained by Major King) sounded hollow, as if on a table,\nand from their sound it would not be possible to tell whence they came.\nWhen immediately afterwards, the girl was in the coal-hole, the knocks\non the stairs sounded from a place within her reach.\nNo. 7.\u2014The stairs are so narrow that the girl must have been in front\nof her grandmother, and above her ; if she had shaded the candle with her\nhand it might not have been observed by the old woman, and the stated\neffect might have been easily produced on the half-frightened grandmother.\nNo. 8.\u2014The fright of the girl on seeing the appearance must have been\nwell feigned to deceive her mother, but the girl herself was in such a con\ndition of nervousness as to make it most probable that she was frightened\nat a shadow only.\nConclusions.\n1.\u2014The scratchings were perhaps done by the child at first by accident,\nand persisted in, when the effect was seen, for fun.\n2.\u2014That the grandmother possibly did not actually keep the girl in\nsight when the things fell in the bedroom ; having perhaps turned round to\nspeak to the mother at the bottom of the stairs.\n3.\u2014That the knocks were most likely produced by the child, who at this\ntime was getting rather frightened at her own \" manifestations.\"\n4.\u2014That the father and Mr. M., the neighbour, could not have watched\nthe girl through the scullery door, and that Mr. M., from his reference to\na spirit-hand, suggested a spiritual appearance to the girl.\n5.\u2014The darkening of the candle might have been done by the child\naccidentally, and frightened her as well as her grandmother.\n6.\u2014That the \" spirit \" was purely subjective.\n7.\u2014That on the whole it is most likely that the affair was begun in fun,\ncontinued in fraud, and closed in fright.\nIn this case also it will be seen that one of the incidents, as\ndescribed, was inexplicable by trickery. But it is to be noted that\nnone of the witnesses appear to have alleged that they actually saw\nobjects in the act of falling under circumstances which would have\nmade trickery out of the question. Moreover, the whole matter had\nbeen the theme of general discussion before Colonel Taylor's visit ; and\none at least of the principal witnesses described things which, on her\nown showing, she could not have seen. There seems to have been some\nexaggeration also in the account given by the father of the girl of what\nhe saw through the scullery door. In the alleged occurrence of an\napparition seen by the child alone, as well as in other points, the case\npresents a marked resemblance to the disturbances at Wem. The\n\fPoltergeists. 73\n\"shadowy hand\" alleged to have been seen by the neighbour stretching\nout from the girl recalls some of the descriptions given of seances with\nEusapia and other \" physical mediums.\" On the whole, having regard\nto the doctor's evidence, to the nature of the occurrences reported, and\nto the character of the principal witnesses, I am disposed to agree with\nthe two reporters that the evidence for abnormal agency of any kind\nin the case is hardly worth consideration.\nIV.\u2014The Bramfoed Disturbances.\nIn November and December, 1887, an account appeared in the\nEast Anglian Daily Times of disturbances in a cottage at Bramford,\nnear Ipswich. The cottage was inhabited by Mrs. Parker, a widow,\nThomas Farrington, a grown-up son, by a first marriage, and two other\nchildren, Ellen Parker (11) and Cornelius Parker (10), and an old\nbedridden woman, Mrs. Pelgate. The phenomena consisted of the\nthrowing of stones and dirt outside the house ; raps, noises, and\nthe movement of various articles of furniture inside the house.\nIt was alleged, for instance, that the little girl would be lifted bodily\nin the air ; kettles, a table and sofa would be moved about ; knives\nwould fly out of the cupboard and stick in Ellen's hair, &c., &c.\nFinally, the girl went for a few days to Stowmarket on a visit to a\nmarried sister of her mother's, Mrs. Jeffery. What then ensued is\nthus described by Mr. Jeffery in a letter to the East Anglian Daily\nTimes, dated December 14th, 1887.\n\"The child came to my house on Monday, November 26th, in the evening.\nNothing happened till the Wednesday night following, when raps came at my\nfront door. No one was there. Closing the front door as soon as I got in,\nraps came inside the house till the child went to bed, sleeping with her\ngrandmother. As the child went upstairs, raps followed her, and went on\nin the room. That was all that happened that night.\n\"The next night, in the room where she sat, at about 7 o'clock, I was\nannoyed by hearing raps again in the room where the child, my wife, and\nthe child's grandmother were sitting. No one else was there. This went on\ntill the child and her grandmother went to bed ; raps followed them both\nup the stairs. I then heard a tremendous noise. Mrs. Jeffery went upstairs,\nsaw things moving about, and called me. I went up and found them in a\nterrible fright. I got them both downstairs for an hour, when nothing\nhappened but a few raps, coming from where I did not know.\n\"They went to bed again about 11. My wife went up, and as soon as the\nchild and her grandmother were in bed, I went up. There was no one in the\nroom then but my wife, myself, and those in bed. As soon as I went in, the\nwashstand fell on to me, no one being near it but myself ; next I saw a\nclothes chest, weighing at least seven stones with the contents, jumping\nabout the floor. I put it in its place several times. Then the chairs and all\nthe moveables in the room seemed alive ; even the brass knob screwed on the\n\f74 Frank Podmore.\nbedpost was taken off and dashed across the room. All this time the child\nwas in bed, and a bright light in the room. These disturbances went on till\nabout 12 o'clock that night, when they ceased.\n\"This is what I witnessed myself, but I must mention that in my absence,\nmy wife, my two sons, and my neighbour (Mrs. Read) saw very much the\nsame things as I did. But I leave them to speak for themselves, confining\nmyself to what I saw and heard myself. I have been a resident of Stow-\nmarket 32 years, and I am sure my friends will credit me as a truthful man\nto the best of my ability. \u2014I am, &c. , Robert Jeffery.\nIn the early part of January, 1888, a member of the Society visited\nBramford and Stowmarket to investigate the matter on the spot. He\nsaw Mrs. Parker and was favourably impressed both as regards her\nhonesty and her intelligence. He found out, however, that the\nphenomena occurred only in the presence of the little girl, Ellen ; and\nthat the evidence for the disturbances at Bramford rested almost\nexclusively on her mother's testimony.\nMrs. Parker's statements were of a very surprising kind ; but he\nwas unable to discover any motive for fraud or connivance on her part.\nShe had, indeed, been a pecuniary loser, since the guardians had, in\nconsequence of the disturbances, stopped an allowance for outdoor\nrelief; and she, as a general rule, refused to take money from the\nnewspaper reporters and others who came to see her.\nOur representative ascertained from the constable who had been\nset to watch the house at the beginning of the disturbances, that he\nhad seen the child producing noises and tapping the window with her\nhand, when she believed herself to be unobserved. Also that, some\ndays later, the little boy, Cornelius, had confessed to him that he had\nproduced some of the movements by trickery. The schoolmaster, who\nwas present, gave the following account of the interview between\nCornelius and the policeman. The latter asked the boy whether he\ncaused the noises, &c , purposely. The boy was silent for some time,\nand at last said \" Yes.\" On being asked who first put him up to it,\nthe boy said \" Mrs. Felgate,\"\u2014an exceedingly improbable statement\non the face of it. No threats were used to induce the boy to confess.\nIn conversation with our representative the boy denied that he ever\nmade such a confession.\nThe following is our representative's account of his interview with\nanother witness :\u2014\nMr. Burrows is a bird fancier and has been heretofore a ghost-hunter.\nHe is a shrewd man. He informed me that he went to the cottage one\nSunday, and being slightly acquainted with Thomas Farrington obtained\nadmittance with three friends. It was getting dark when they entered, and\nthey all pretended to be very credulous upon the subject. The boy and his\nmother were sitting on the couch, and the boy had his arm behind his\n\fPoltergeists. 75\nmother, with the result that first a glove and then a baby's bib were thrown\nout. Mr. B. saw the boy working his arm. The girl was under the table,\nwhere she could be seen however by Mr. B. He saw her kick her leg up, so\nas to send her boot across the room. At the same time she screamed out\n\" They've taken my boot.\" He then saw the boy stoop down at the fire\nplace. He placed his own head low down over his knees, and presently saw\nthe boy dart his arm backwards, with the result that the poker flew across\nthe floor. He kept his eye on the boy, in the confusion, and saw him seize\nthe kettle, and roll that along the floor. The boy also when sitting beside\nhis mother on the sofa, took off his coat, and placed it under him, to see if\nthe spirits would drag it out. While doing so and after, he managed to\nwriggle the cushion upon which he sat from beneath him, and threw that\nacross the room, striking the cat.\nMr. Burrows then left with some ironical compliments. What degree of\ninference instead of actual sight there may be in Mr. B. 's evidence, I cannot\nsay. He said repeatedly that he saw these acts of deception. His prejudices\nor convictions were evidently strong. I think it must be believed that he\nsaw some at least of the acts of deception.\nOur representative then proceeded to Stowmarket. Of Mr. Jeffery\nhe wrote, \" Simplicity and honesty are manifestly his characteristics.\"\nThe grandmother was described by Mr. Jeffery himself \" as not know\ning quite what she said.\" The report continues :\u2014\nThe washstand fell upon Mr. Jeffery as he entered the room. The door\nopens outward, the washstand therefore might be placed overlapping the\ndoor, and on Mr. Jeffery's entering, his leg might strike it, for it does not\nrise much higher than a man's knee, and so he might think it fell against him,\nunder the influence of his prevailing impressions.\nThe chest which he saw jumping about the floor, and which he put in its\nplace several times, he saw really jump only once and then a few inches,\nthough it jumped several times when he was out of the room. This chest,\nwhich is a box, stood about 1\u00a3 feet from the side of the low bed, on which\nthe child was lying, and stands on a support which raises it about two inches\nfrom the ground thus :\nBy stretching out an arm quickly and getting purchase underneath the\nbox, the child could lug it from its place. Now upon the occasion that Mr.\nJeffery saw the chest move, he had just put it back in its place, and was\nwalking away from it, with his back to it, and it was when he turned the\ncorner of the bed that he saw it move. He must have seen it out of the\nright corner of his right eye. The child may have given the box a tug, and\n\f76 Frank Podmore.\ngot its arm in bed again, before the man could turn round. He may then\nhave perceived that the box had moved, and this may have become confused\nin his mind with seeing it move.\nMr. Jeffery was not in the room when the brass knob was thrown.\nHe says that he stood at the door and watched the child for 20 minutes.\nDuring that time only two things occurred ; one was that a piece of an old\nbedstead leaning against the wall to his right jumped once two inches high.\nThis phenomenon again, as he was watching the child to the left, he would see\nout of the right corner of the right eye. Expectation moreover could easily\ncause a piece of furniture to appear to jump two inches. I have seen the\nphenomenon myself. But Mr. Jeffery says he also heard it thump down\nagain. It is possible he heard a knock which he localised to his right, and\nthat at the same moment the old bedstead appeared to jump so as to explain\nthe knock.\nThe second incident that occurred was that the table to his left, against\nthe wall upon the the side of the bed nearest to him, and therefore with the\nold lady between the table and the girl, moved. He saw it move with his\nown eyes. It moved a foot, so that the corner of the table farthest from the\ngirl moved through the arc of a circle towards her.\nNo one was near the table, except the grandmother on that side of the\nbed. As Mr. Jeffery firmly adhered to his statement of the time and circum\nstances under which this movement took place, excluding all action by the\ngrandmother, there is only one explanation of the statement, apart from\nacceptance, namely that Mr. Jeffery, having shown so much confusion of\nstatement, may here be making a confused statement which has become\npetrified into a mistaken belief.\nMrs. Bead, who seemed an intelligent woman, though summoned to the\nscene, saw nothing, except the washstand fall upon Mr. Jeffery. She heard\nknocks, however, and seemed to believe that something very wonderful had\ntaken place.\nI did not see the boys.\nThe report concludes as follows :\u2014\nThere is no evidence of genuineness, there is evidence of fraud.\nThe explanation of the occurrences which commends itself to me is as\nfollows :\u2014\nThe children one day varied their amusement of throwing things at one\nanother, by throwing at the old lady, Mrs. Felgate. They would then deny\nhaving thrown, and Mrs. Felgate may have said something like \"spirits\nmust have done it then.\" They would take up this idea, and being in danger\nof thrashing for throwing stones in the yard, which struck the door, or dirt,\nwhich hit the windows, they would deny doing it and say it was done by the\nspirits, and that they saw the stones rise from the ground, and so on from\nlie to lie ; till they found themselves in the midst of a popular excitement,\nand continued their tricks from very fear. \"To return were tedious as go\no'er. \" The fact that the mother and young Farrington went to the policeman\nand tried to get him to enquire into it, seems to show that they were deceived\nby the children and that they were not parties to a fraud. Mrs. Parker's\nstatement can hardly upon the present hypothesis be an accurate version of\n\fPoltergeists. 77\nthe facts. But possibly she would be found to romance as much upon any\nother topic. She and her son both seem to me respectable, possessed of an\nhonest pride. Their refusing money may be from the motive that their\nreputation is dear to them, and they wish to prove to their fellow villagers\nthat they are not the sort of people they take them for. I call the son\nrespectable, because he supports his mother, has been married once and is\ngoing to marry again. And there is nothing against the woman, except the\nprejudices of the neighbourhood. The efiect which the child has produced\nupon the mind of Jeffrey, she might produce upon her own mother and\nbrother. And if they found her out once or twice, that would make little\ndifference in their belief.\nIt remains to add that, according to the girl's own statement\u2014\n.corroborated, so far as such a statement could be corroborated, by her\nmother\u2014Ellen during the progress of the disturbances suffered from\ntransient attacks of blindness (possibly of a hysterical nature). The\n\u25a0child further said that in the course of these attacks she could see a\nsailor standing over her with a chain in his hands to bind her and\ncarry her off. She would also see a white woman beckoning and hear\nher singing. The boy, Cornelius, also stated that he had seen an\napparition, which did not, however, resemble either of the figures\nalleged to have been seen by his sister.\nV.\u2014The Waterford Case.\nIn January, 1892, the Irish papers contained accounts of disturb\nances in a haunted house at Waterford. Appended is an extract from\n& Dublin paper :\u2014\n\"Curious Occurrence at Waterford.\n\" An occurrence of a curious nature, and one which is the all-absorbing\ntopic of city gossip, is reported from a portion of Ballybricken known as\nCostelloe's-lane. It appears that some three weeks ago a pensioner of the\nRoyal Irish Constabulary, named K., with his family took up his residence\nthere, prior to coming to Waterford. He held the position of caretaker on\nan evicted farm in the Passage East district. While in occupation he\nreported to Sergeant Murphy, of Passage East, that he and his family\nwere disturbed at night by unearthly sounds. The sergeant, who is no\nbeliever in ghosts, commanded an escort party to the house, the approaches\nto which were taken possession of, and one of the men stationed in the\ninterior. While there the sergeant and his men heard unmistakably\nunearthly sounds. The man on duty inside saw furniture dashed about\nby some invisible agency. Sergeant Murphy reported the result of his\nexperience to his superior officer in Waterford, and Head-Constable Waters\nwas sent out to investigate the allegation that ghosts were haunting K.'s\nhouse ; but despite all entreaties, the caretaker and his family left in a\nstate of terror, turning up, as has been stated, at Costelloe's-lane, in the\ncity, where he seems to have lived in peace until Saturday night last,\nwhen he created quite a panic by raising the alarm that the ghosts who had\n\f78 Frank Podmore.\nhunted him from his Passage East home had tracked him there. Some of\nhis neighbours entered the house, and found his family in a state of the\ngreatest possible nervous excitement. They saw articles of furniture thrown\nabout, crockery smashed, and heard a voice quite audibly. They fled out of\nthe house in terror and raised the alarm, with the result that the police\nauthorities visited the house yesterday, and again to-day, as did hundreds\nof citizens, including several Roman Catholic clergymen. All the approaches\nto the house have to-day been closely guarded, but unearthly voices are still\nheard. At the time of telegraphing, some hundreds of people are in the\nvicinity waiting for the latest news regarding the action of the ghosts in\nK.'s house.\"\nOn February 7th, 1892, Mr. J. W. Hayes, an Honorary Associate\nof the Society for Psychical Research, went to Waterfowl to investi\ngate the matter. K. and his family had left Waterford some days,\nbefore his arrival, but Mr. Hayes saw the police and several of the\nneighbours. K., it appears, was an emergency caretaker, i.e., a care\ntaker on \" evicted \" farms ; an occupation always unpopular and\noccasionally hazardous. He is said to have been a nervous man, and\none who would be readily imposed upon. His occupation appears to-\nhave been distasteful to his wife. The appended statements contain,\nthe evidence of the three chief witnesses interviewed by Mr. Hayes.\nEvidence of Head Constable Elders. Taken February 1st, 1892, in the\nday-room at Lady-lane, Station, Waterford.\nWhen Peter K. reported to Sergeant Murphy, of Passage East, that he\nwas \" tormented with supernatural noises,\" the sergeant and one man (not an\n\"escort party\") went and examined the place inside and outside, and.\nsatisfied themselves that there were no strangers about. This house had two\nbedrooms at the left of the entrance door, opening into one another, and\ndivided by a partition wall, in which partition was a permanently closed door\n(marked F), and, a little lower down, another door which opened and shut\n(marked E). The other apartments in the house were a kitchen (just as you\ngo in), and a room at the right used as a chicken house. On one occasion\nwhen Sergeant Murphy visited the house, K.'s boy Johnny complained of\nbeing sick, and retired to bed at three in the afternoon. The bed he occupied\nwas in bedroom B, and his bed ran alongside the partition, the foot of the\nbed being only a foot or so from the closed door F. Sergeant Murphy\nstationed himself in the kitchen, and after a while several loud knocks (as if\nmade with a stick) were heard proceeding from the room where the boy lay.\nThe sergeant immediately went in and found the boy lying quietly in the\nbed, but not a bit frightened. The young fellow, when questioned, said the\nknocks came on the closed door, but no further knocking took place while;\nthe sergeant was in the room, neither did the sergeant search the bed to see\nwhether the boy produced the knocks with a stick or not. K.\u2014it is generally\nsupposed, at the request of his wife\u2014threw up this situation as caretaker,,\nand came with his family into Waterford, taking up his residence at\nCostelloe's-lane. On Sunday, January 24th, 1892, he called at the police-\nstation in Waterford, and reported that the ghost was again at work, that\n\fPoltergeists.\nEntrance\nDoor\nFireplace\n8 S 5\n5 M\nMR. K.'S RESIDENCE IN c.\n\fso Frank Podmore.\nafter going to bed on Saturday night, he heard knocks at the door, and\ngetting up, placed himself behind the door, until his son should get up\nto take his place. On opening the door they found no one. He then\nwent out to the yard, and fancied he saw three dark objects run over the\nwall, and when he came in he heard a voice under one of the beds\nsaying, \"This is not the ghost you heard in Carrigleigh ; I'll follow you\nwherever you go, in spite of the police.\" The Waterford police called at\nhis house at 1 o'clock on Sunday morning, January 24th, and saw one\npane of glass broken, but no sound was produced while they were on the\npremises. They went away, but at 3 o'clock on the same day K. reported\nthat at 3 o'clock on Sunday morning the ledges were burst off the back door\nof the kitchen, and the door forced open. This door was merely fastened\nwith a small bolt, which shot into an auger hole close to the edge of the door\npost. Now the side of the auger hole showed no sign of having been\nburst either in or out. The ledges which were stated to have been knocked\noff by the ghost bore marks of violence, as if they had been repeatedly and\nheavily struck with a blunt instrument, or were hammered off. At 4 o'clock\nK. stated that another pane of glass was broken. The police examined the\nbits of glass, which fell outside in all cases, and found traces of reddish\npaint on some of them, as if a piece of painted timber had been used to\nbreak the glass out. The chairs in the room were ordinary wooden ones\npainted a reddish colour. Some broken delph and jam pots and bottles\nwere spread around the floor, and pointed out as having been thrown there\nby supernatual agency. A hatchet was found in the house, (and is still to\nthe good), the head of which had distinct reddish paint marks, just as if it\nhad been used to crush painted timber. Nothing supernatural occurred\nwhile the police watched. In the house in Costelloe's-lane, Johnny K.\nslept in a room to the left of the hall-door. The room had a window, and in\nthis window the glass was broken outwards. Here also the voice was said to\nbe heard.\nEvidence of Mrs. P. Dea, of Costelloe's-lane, Waterford. Taken\nFebruary 2nd, 1892.\nOn Sunday week I was in K. 's house along with a young man, having gone\nin to see the ghost act. I distinctly saw Johnny K. roll a ball or something\nacross the floor and it rolled in under a table. I then saw him, when he\nthought I was not minding him, hurl a jam pot on to the floor. Afterwards\nI saw him sneak round to the bellows and contrive to fling it on the floor.\nThe father was in the room when J. flung the bellows and said \"Johnny,\nwas it you threw that ? \" Johnny said \"No, Sir.\" \" But you did throw it,\"\nsaid Mrs. Dea. \"I didn't,\" said Johnny laughing. Mrs. D. states that she\nis \"prepared to swear\" that she saw the boy throw these things and other\nthings too. She states that Mrs. K. did not seem the least bit alarmed at\nthe action of the \" ghosts.\"\nEvidence of Patrick Dea. Taken February 2nd, quite independently of\nwhat his wife stated.\nI was at K.'s house at a quarter past 11 on Sunday night week. Two\nmore fellows were with me ; we went in to watch the ghosts. Peter K. was in\n\fPoltergeists. SI\nbed, but Johnny was at the fire. We all engaged in conversation, but at the\nsame time I kept my eye on the boy, although I kept my head down. [It\nshould be remarked that Dea has crooked eyes, so that in reality it would be\nvery hard to tell when he was looking straight at a person.] I saw Johnny\nstand up from where he was leaning on the table or box and gradually shove a\ntin gallon over to himself. Originally it was at the far end of the box or table.\nHe then a few moments after put his two hands to the back of his head as if\nhe was tired and wanted to rest his head against them. Then leaning\nbackwards he took up the gallon and jerked it over his head and it fell on\nthe middle of the floor. I thereupon said to the young men with me, \"Oh,\ncome on home, lads, if that's the sort of ghosts are around. \" After that the\nfather got up when he heard us going and asked me to stay with Johnny to\nprotect him. I refused and went away disgusted. I am prepared to swear\nto these matters and think the boy should have been prosecuted.\nThus it would appear that no phenomena took place at any time\nwhile the police were on the spot, except that on one occasion at C.\nknocks occurred as if made with a stick on a door in the next room\nout of sight of the policeman and close to Johnny. There seems to be\nno evidence that phenomena ever occurred beyond the reach or the\npower of Johnny, and whatever agency produced the phenomena used\nvery human means. Thus the cross pieces appear to have been\nknocked off the door with a hatchet, and a piece of painted wood\nappears to have been used to break the windows.\nIt seems that the neighbours were generally agreed that though\nthe father, a timid and credulous person, was much alarmed, and\nbelieved the disturbances to be due to the spirit of a dead man named\nH., Johnny and his mother were not in the least nervous or frightened\nby the proceedings of the \" ghost.\" Finally, we may add that the\neffect of the disturbances was to induce the father to give up his\ncaretaking jobs, leave the neighbourhood, and remove with his family\nto\u2014as it is believed\u2014the part of the country where his wife's\nrelations lived.\nCase VI.\nThe occurrences described in the next case took place at a post\noffice in a town near London. The witnesses were examined by\nLieutenant-Colonel Taylor, who from notes of the conversation with\nthem drew up statements, which were afterwards corrected and signed\nby the persons concerned. The names and initials given are fictitious.\nStatement of Miss K.\nFebruary 13th, 1895.\nThe mysterious manifestations about which you are interested began\nshortly before my mother's death on June 30th, 1893, when only she and my\nniece, Ellen P. , who is now about 16 years old, were living in the house with\nme. We had been in residence about a year and a half when we began to\nG\n\f82 Frank Podmore.\nobserve that small things were unaccountably moved, flower vases upset, etc.,\nand for some time we thought it must be the cat (a foreign cat which came\nabout the place. )\nOne Sunday morning I sent my niece off to church, locking the outside\ndoor after her ; shortly afterwards I followed her, my mother locking the\ndoor after me. On my return my mother reported that shortly after I left\nshe went to the kitchen and found things displaced ; some chops which were\nfor dinner and some milk, both of which had previously been placed in the\ncupboard and its door shut, were found upon the kitchen floor. She replaced\nthe chops and prepared for dinner by placing some potatoes in a bowl of\nwater to soak. She went upstairs and on her return in a few minutes found\nthe bowl on the floor with the potatoes under it. The window (a cottage\nwindow) was open and I put the whole thing down to cats again.\nShortly after my mother's death an elderly friend and a little boy came\nto stay with ine ; after their arrival annoyances began again. Things were\nmoved and temporarily lost, being sometimes found on the dust heap in the\nyard, a bonnet and some other things put into water, hats were wetted and\nspoiled. At this time things became serious, for the Postal Orders in the\noffice were interfered with ; one day Ellen was in the office when a person\ncame in for a P. O. for 15s. ; she called out to me ' ' Auntie, where are the\n15s. P. O.'s ? I can't find them.\" I said they were on the counter. They\nwere there a few minutes before, but had now disappeared. I was greatly\nfrightened.\nFortunately, soon after, while looking for them, my eye caught sight of\npart of one sticking out of the door of a cupboard in the office and in this\nwe found them uninjured, but apparently roughly placed there, some at the\nbottom of the cupboard and some on the middle shelf. All the P. O. 's were\nnot interfered with on this occasion ; only those from 10s. Cd. up to 20s. were,\nI think, missing.\nIn September a servant named Alice came (age 23. ) After her arrival\nthe annoyances increased. Besides the removal of objects and their partial\ndestruction by water, they were found now frequently in the boiler in the\nkitchen range as well as in the yard. Doors were found locked1 and the\nkeys missing, a bed was wetted, besides other things which I will now relate.\nShortly after Alice came, one evening I wanted her to go out for something,\nand when she came downstairs with her jacket on I saw she had a peculiar\nwhite mark on the back of it. I brushed it off and told her to go upstairs\nagain ; this she did and returned at once, when I found two white marks of\nthe same kind as before. These I removed and again sent her upstairs ; she\nreturned again marked as before. A third and a fourth time I tried the\nsame experiment with the same result. The marks were on a part of her\nback which I don't think she could reach with her own fingers but were\nlike marks which would be made by whitened fingers being placed on her.\nThe girl was after this always getting marks on her back, so that at the close\nof a day's work her back would be covered with them ; she said she never\nfelt herself touched. About this time one Sunday evening, at Miss Z.'s\nsuggestion, I tied Alice's hands in front of her and sent her upstairs ; she\n1 Doors were locked also in the elderly person's time.\n\fFoltergeists. 83\nreturned at once with the usual marks in the usual places. She said she felt\nno touch, but felt a cold sensation on her back while shew as away. On the\nTuesday following we tried the experiment again. There were present :\u2014\nMr., Mrs., and Miss Y., Mr. R., Miss Z., Miss H. (now Mrs. L.).\nMr. Y. bound Alice's hands in front of her, and secured them further by\npassing the cord round her waist ; we sent her upstairs and on her immediate\nreturn marks as usual were found on her.\nShe was sent to other places besides upstairs with a similar result. She\nwas unbound and on return from a moment spent upstairs had marks. She\nwas again bound and the same results to our experiment were obtained.\nOn one or two other occasions Alice's hands were bound and on returning\nafter being sent upstairs the usual sort of white marks were found on her\nback. Once her own father thus bound her hands.\nJust after this Alice reported one morning that about six inches of her\nhair had been cut off in the night ; we never found this hair. Three days\nafter this my niece's hair began to be cut off lock by lock, from three to four\ninches long, and thrown on the ground.\nThis \"cutting \" began early in the afternoon, continued during that day\nand the next morning, but not during the night which separated them. Ellen\nsays she felt nothing, and though I was constantly on the look out, I never\nsaw a lock being cut off but only found one on the ground now and again,\ntill all the girl's hair was cut short and it was so hacked that the barber had\nto cut the remainder close to her head. I have only kept some of it.\nAbout this time, one day I was in my room preparing to go out. Alice\nwas also upstairs, but Ellen was below. Alice went out of her room for\nsomething, and on her return called out that Miss Ellen's bed was all wet.\nI went into the room, and saw this was the condition of the bed. This was\nthe only time a bed was made wet during 1893, when Alice was with me.\nThe Monday after Ellen's hair was cut off, I sent her and Alice away.\nDuring the absence of both for one day, nothing, to my knowledge, took\nplace. On Alice's return, a few things were unaccountably moved about,\nand on the return of my niece the following Wednesday, all abnormal\nmanifestations ceased for a whole year. This was near the end of\nNovember, 1893.\nIn April, 1894, Alice left, and in September a new servant arrived (whom\nwe always called Jane).\nIn November, things of an unusual kind began again\u2014beds were con\ntinually being wetted, things moved about and lost, a door locked and a key\nmissing on two different occasions, so that I had to have the lock taken off\nto be able to get about, and as a new feature in the matter, things put on\nthe fire.\nThe first time anything unusual happened in connection with my servant\nJane was one Saturday early in November, '94. I sent her for some soap,\nwhich she brought home and placed on the table in the kitchen and then went\nabout her work. I was in the kitchen at the time and saw it placed on the\ntable, but after that lost sight of it. In the afternoon this soap was wanted,\nbut could not be found ; my servant was greatly concerned about its loss and\noffered to buy me a new piece. I was lying down in the sitting room when\nthe soap was missed, and said ' ' Don't be frightened, Jane ; go and look in\n\f84 Frank Podmore.\nthe boiler.\" The soap was found there. I mentioned the boiler as a likely\nplace to find it, as from experience I knew that it was a favourite hiding-\nplace. Another of the first cases of this second set of annoyances was\nwhen I was at tea one Saturday. Jane was in the room, and filled a jug\nwith hot water, which she set on the table in front of me. When I was\nabout to use it, I heard something metallic in the jug, and on looking found\nmy scissors in it. The girl declared that she was sure the scissors were not\nin it when she filled it with hot water.\nThe next morning, Sunday, the servant found the door locked between\nthe sitting-room and the office, and the key missing. I had the lock taken\noff. The next day the key was found, and I had the lock replaced. I put\nthe key in my own pocket for safety, as, till now, nothing had been removed\nfrom my person. In the evening, however, I found the key was gone, and\nas I expected in consequence that the door would be locked, I looked at\nabout 10.30 p.m., after supper, to see if it was so\u2014it was not. Shortly\nafterwards, when I was poking the fire, Ellen and the servant heard a\n\"click,\" and Jane said to my niece, \"Did you hear that?\" She said\n\"Yes,\" and I exclaimed \"Go and look at the door.\" Jane went and\nlooked, saying, \"Locked, miss,\"\u2014it was locked ! No one had been near\nthe door since I had looked and found it not locked. I had to take the lock\noff again. Next morning the key was found in a saucepan of water. The\nmost distressing form of annoyance which has characterised these disturb\nances has been the repeated wetting of the beds both with clean and foul\nwater. In 1894 this became frequent ; sometimes all four beds (there are\ntwo on one bedstead) have been wetted at the same time. I have super\nintended the housemaid's work in the bedrooms, but still the beds have been\nwetted, but not so much. Ellen or Jane have always been the last upstairs\non these occasions, except when sometimes they have come down together.\nOne Sunday (same day she found door locked first time) during November,\nthe servant reported the teapot missing. On Thursday Miss H. was helping\nme to look for some stockings, which also had been lost. We had carefully\ngone through all three bedrooms from Ellen's to mine, but not finding them,\ndetermined to search back again before trying downstairs. We were\nending our second search of the bedrooms when on opening a box situated\nnear the top of the stairs, we found on the top of everything the missing tea\npot ; this box had been opened and searched by us a few minutes before, at\nwhich time there was no teapot in it. I am certain that Ellen could not have\ncome up and placed it there while we were in my room and the servant was\nnot in the house. Going on with our search for the stockings downstairs, I\nput my hand into the boiler and found it empty. Ellen at that moment came\nout of the office, and went straight to the cupboard for the scissors, which were\nseen there before we went upstairs. They were not to be found. Ellen asked\nme if I knew where they were, I said \"No.\" During this conversation Miss\nH. and I had gone into the sitting room from the kitchen and after staying\nfor a minute or two in that room looking for the scissors, I returned to the\nkitchen, and again felt in the boiler, where I now found the scissors. Miss\nH. followed me into the kitchen and Ellen followed her. I am certain that\nEllen did not go into the kitchen between the time I felt in the boiler for\nthe stockings and the finding of the scissors. The servant was still out.\n\fPoltergeists. 85\nThe police were called in, but could make nothing of it all.\nOne Wednesday in November, Jane and my niece went away from home,\nbut before they left we missed the lamp glass from my lamp. On Friday I\nwas sitting over the fire in an armchair when I was called into the office. On\nmy return I found the curtains of the window behind my chair had been\npulled back and hitched up over the back of my chair, and when I came to\nlook close I found iny lamp glass on the sill. Miss Jones came in just after\nand I showed her the state of the curtain and the position of the lamp glass.\nI don't know when the glass got there, it might have been there since Wed\nnesday.\nOn another occasion, in November 1894, I was engaged in the office and\nhad told Ellen to watch a garment which was drying before the fire in the\nsitting room ( it must always be remembered that we found that as long as\nanything was watched it was not interfered with). Ellen was wanted in the\noffice, and before coming removed the garment to the kitchen table for safety.\nOn her return in a few minutes she found the garment on the fire. I took it\noff myself. Jane was upstairs all the time and knew nothing about it.\nDuring this month also, when alone in the house, I have heard steps in the\nroom over the sitting room, and once when Miss H. and I were the only\npeople at home we both heard the steps in the same room.\nI also heard the nine knocks about which Miss H. speaks when she was\nin the cellar. I never heard similar knocks at any other time.\nWhat I have stated is only a small part of that which has taken place.\nAt one time things of one kind or another went on every hour of the day ;\nthey are not now so frequent. Still on Friday, January 4th, 1895, Miss B., my\nassistant in the post office, lost some of her things, and on Saturday, the 19th,\na folded sheet was put into the water in one of the bedrooms. Ellen, who\nhad gone upstairs for a handkerchief, says all was right when she left the\nroom, but when I went up a quarter of an hour afterwards the sheet was in\nthe water. Our servant had left us before this took place.\nI have perfect confidence in my niece and do not think for a moment that\nEllen has had any hand in producing these mysterious and annoying things.\nNor can I suspect either of my servants.\nI have had to search the house so many times for various things that I\nknow every corner of it, and feel sure that when things are missing and\nsubsequently found in the yard or house, they could not in the meantime be\nconcealed anywhere about. I am confident that if they had been in the\nhouse I should have found them, at all events such large things as lady's\nhats, a teapot, etc. Small things, of course, I could not be so confident\nabout.\nI have had many people in the house who have searched it and cross-\nexamined us for an explanation of these things, but with no result. On more\nthan one occasion when Alice with her hands bound was sent upstairs and\nreturned with the white marks on her back, the stairs and rooms above\nhave been searched to discover anything by means of which she might have\nprinted the marks on her back or otherwise caused them, but nothing has\nbeen found of this nature.\nMy landlord, Mr. T., a retired carpenter, has frequently been here ; he\nspeaks about the affair in a peculiar manner. He says for example that his\n\f86 Frank Podmore.\nwife, who lived in this house with him 20 or 22 years ago, \" had a devil ; \"\nthat it would soon all come out now. I asked on one occasion if he could\nsee through my affair. He assented and added, \"But I have left it all to\nGod. He has forgiven me.\" Another day I asked him to explain his\nmeaning as to seeing through this affair, but he said \" How can II It is\nimpossible for me to explain it.\"\nI think it right to say that I think he has a kind of religious mania, and I\nam not altogether sure that he quite understands the significance which\nmight be attached to his statements.\nSome gentlemen came on the evening of January 5th and held a stance.\nThey suppose themselves to have got into communication with the \" spirit \"\nwho is causing all these annoyances, and to have obtained a very extraordinary\naccount of who he had been in this life and what had become of him.\nI know nothing of spiritualism and never was at a seance before, so I can\noffer no opinion about this one.\nIn a letter dated June, 1895, Miss K. stated that the disturbances\nstill continued ; the new servant's best hat had recently been found in\na water-jug, and a pair of stockings, some teacups and a library book\nin the kitchen boiler.\nOther witnesses depose to the disappearances of gloves, a hat, and\nvarious other objects ; and confirm Miss K.'s account of the finding\nof the teapot, the chalk marks on the servant's back, and other\nphenomena.\nOf Ellen, Colonel Taylor writes, '. She is a girl of about 16 years\nold, very intelligent, but a cripple from her infancy. She cannot\neasily raise her hands to her head. She uses scissors in an imperfect\nand awkward manner. She limps and is not able to move about\nquickly, or without considerable noise.\"\nIn her signed statement Ellen corroborates generally her aunt's\nversion of the various incidents, and denies that she herself had had\nany part in doing the things. The statement concludes as follows :\u2014\nStatement of Ellen P.\nFebruary 13th, 1895.\n1st Appearance.\u2014I now come to a separate experience of mine.\nOn June 6th, 1893, before my grandmother died, but after a few\nunaccountable things had taken place in the house, I was in the office when\na stranger who was well dressed and had a top hat on came in and asked for\na Postal Order for 5s. I gave him one, and he paid for it in two half-crowns\nand a penny. I thought him an ordinary customer. He entered into\nconversation with me, and said he knew my grandfather and other relations,\nthat he knew my Auntie very well, and told me her Christian name. I said,\n\"Let me call her, she would like to see you,\" but he would not let me.\nEventually he went out and I told Auntie about him.\n2nd Appearance.\u2014At about 4.15 the same day I was in Orchard-street\nwhen a man, like a beggar, in ragged clothes, whom I did not recognize, and\n\fPoltergeists. 87\nwho was standing a little way down Newton-street, beckoned to me and said,\n\" Come here, I won't hurt you. I am the gentleman who was talking to you\nin the office.\" I went up to him and did not feel afraid, nor at the time did\nI think how strange it was that he should be so different. He said his name\nwas Sykes and that he lived in Lacey-street, but he carried on the thread of\nthe conversation begun in the office, and at the time I considered him the\nsame individual as had bought the 5s. order, in spite of his changed\nappearance. He also told me on this occasion that my Aunt had written\na business letter, the name of the person to whom it was addressed, and\nits contents. He said that my Aunt had sold her earrings some time ago,\nand what she had got for them. He told me that Auntie had been to G.'s\nshop and what she had bought. He also repeated to me a conversation which\nhad been carried on during the day in the office in my presence between my\nAunt and two friends who came in. I asked him how he knew, and he\nanswered that he was listening round the corner.\n3rd Appearance.\u2014At 5.30 about, I was in the yard when he looked over\nthe door at the end. This time he was dressed as a parson, and had quite a\ndifferent face. I only saw his head and as much of his neck as to show me\nhis clerical collar, etc. I did not recognize him, except that he said that he was\nthe same person who had spoken to me before, and from his conversation I\nbelieved him. He told me he was the Rev. Mr. B., who had been engaged\nto my aunt's sister, and added that she did not die of consumption, but that\nhe had broken her heart. He said he had preached at St. Stephen's Church.\nHe said he stuck on his moustache with gum, and had often tried to alter\nthe colour of his eyes by pouring ink into them. He showed me a small\nhassock which he said he kept to enable him to look over the gate, and he\nshowed me something black which he said was the pocket in which he kept\nit. He said lastly, \" I have plenty of money, but I would rather lay it all\nat your feet than that your Auntie should see me.\"\n4t\/i Appearance.\u2014At about 7 the same evening I was in the W. road\nwhen I saw him again. This time he was dressed as a soldier. He had on a\nstriped coat, red and black, dark trousers with a wide red stripe down them\nand a round cap with a yellow band set slantways on his head. He had a\ngun in his hand which he held by the middle, off the ground, and with the\nthick end towards me. I know it was a gun because I saw the thing you\npull to make it go off. He was standing on the outer edge of the pavement\nfacing inwards. He told me that Auntie was in the habit of walking along\nthe T. Road with a dark lady ; he did not like it, and would shoot them,\nbut would shoot the dark lady first. He said he loved Auntie, and I asked\nhim why he wanted to shoot her, and he answered \"I must do my duty.\" I\nknew him for the same person that I had spoken to before by his conversa\ntion. He had stopped me as I passed him.\noth Appearance.\u2014Next day about 8.30 a.m. I saw him again over the\nyard gate, this time dressed as a sailor. He said, \"Here I am again. I\nwas in the passage when the policeman came at 12 o'clock last night. I put\nup my hands and disappeared. When I want to turn into a man again I put\nmy hands down. It is your grandmother's birthday to-day, and your Aunt\nhas just wished her ' many happy returns of the day.' \" He also said that\nGranny had spasms that morning, which was true. It was also true about\n\fFrank Podmore.\nAuntie wishing her mother many happy returns, for I had heard her do no\njust before the sailor appeared. He said also, \" I know they are going\nto set the police to watch me.\"\n6th Appearance. \u2014About five minutes after this he again looked over the\ngate, this time as a woman dressed in maroon velvet with a hat just like\nAuntie's. She said, \" Come here. I want to tell you something more.\" She\nsaid that Mrs. M. had come in and borrowed 2s. from Auntie, and had\nrepaid it on Saturday morning.\n7th Appearance.\u2014Again at about 8.40 she appeared over the gate, this\ntime dressed in dark blue velvet. Auntie had told me that if I saw him (or\nher) again I was to say that she wondered that he (or she) had nothing better-\nto do. This I did. Her eyes blazed, and she said, \"If she says that again\nI will make her life a terror to her. \"\n9th Appearance. \u2014Mr. F. came in during the morning, and on being told\nabout these visits insisted on going for the police. While he was gone, and\nwhile Auntie was upstairs, I was in the office at the telegraph instrument,\nwhen \" my stranger\" came in as a well-dressed man and said, \" The police\nare after me, I am going abroad.\" He put out his left hand to shake hands,\nbut I could not leave the instrument. He then said, \"Good-bye. I am off,\nyou will never see me again. \"\n9th Appearance.\u2014I did see him again, however, in the street shortly after\nwards ; as I passed him he said, without turning to me, \" You see I am not\ngone yet.\"\nThe following are some more scraps of conversation I remember, but\ncan't quite recollect at which appearance they took place.\nWhen he appeared as a beggar, I think, he told me that Mr. J. had\ncome to breakfast on one occasion some years before, and had had a hard\negg given to him.\nHe told me that he was the person who had written a letter to my Aunt\nasking her to meet him on the W. road.\nDuring one of his visits he told me that Auntie had come to the N.\nStreet window and asked Granny for Miss J.'s \" register \" (a book). I was\nasleep at the time she did so, and did not know it till he told me.\nI had heard \"Grandma \" say to Auntie, \" I wonder if the C. 's could see\nhim in the passage.\" When afterwards I went into the yard and he was\nspeaking to me, I can't remember which time, he said, \" You think the C.'s\ncan see me, but they can't ; nobody can see me.\" I had not mentioned the\nC. 's to him.\nThe C.'s then lived opposite to us, and their \"bake office\" was almost\nopposite our passage.\nFrom time to time I told Auntie and my grandmother what was going\non. Auntie made several attempts to see him, but never could do so, and the\npolice were unable to trace him in any way.\nHe told me much more during our conversations than I can now\nremember.\nSome of the things he told me I knew before, some I remembered when\nhe told me, but much that he said was new to me, and the pleasure of being\ntold my Aunt's secrets had something to do with my forgetting to be\nfrightened at his change of appearance.\n\fPoltergeists. 89\nIt remains only to add that several witnesses had heard mysterious\nsteps and knockings in the house ; and that three persons testified to\nhaving seen, on two separate occasions, a white cloudy apparition in the\nparlour. On the first of these occasions the apparition was collective.\nAs regards the physical phenomena, Colonel Taylor remarks that\n\" the greater number of the incidents would, if considered singly, be\njustly and naturally referred to the ordinary action of some one or\nother of the occupants of the house.\" After considering each incident\nseparately and pointing out a possible explanation by normal means,\nhe proceeds :\u2014\" As to the marks reported to have been repeatedly\nproduced on the servant's back, if any reliance is to be placed on the\naccuracy of the narrators, and if the amount of evidence available is\nconsidered sufficient, these may be considered, I think, as beyond\nexplanation by ordinary means.\" As regards the amount of evidence\navailable, no less than six witnesses (exclusive of Miss K. and Alice\nherself) attest the appearance of the mysterious \" markings \" on the\nservant's back, after she had been sent upstairs with her hands tightly\nbound. One witness adds the interesting observation that when the\nservant was sent into the yard outside the house instead of upstairs,\n\" a white mark of indefinite shape \" was found on her back ; and\nanother states that when he accompanied Alice upstairs no marks\nappeared. None of the witnesses in their original statements mention\nthe whereabouts of Ellen dui'ing these manifestations. Alice in\nher account of the matter does not mention Ellen ; and Ellen's\nown signed statement contains no allusion to the chalk marksr It\nis true that Colonel Taylor, in his report, states that Ellen was present\nand witnessed the phenomenon, but he does not give his authority for\nthis statement. One of the witnesses, Mr. R., a clerk from the head\npost office of the town, in a report which he was good enough to send\nus in March, 1896 (more than two years after the occurrence), states\nthat Ellen was in the parlour on the occasion when he was present and\nsaw the chalk marks with the others in the kitchen. His contem\nporary statement (unsigned), as taken down by Colonel Taylor, contains\nhowever, no reference to Ellen.\nIn view of the uncertainty as to the whereabouts of a person who,\non any theory of the disturbances, must be regarded as the central\nfigure in the drama, and regarding the phenomenon as one which could\nbe readily produced by normal means, even without Ellen's intervention,\nI am disposed to question both the accuracy of the narrators, and the\nsufficiency of the evidence in this instance for abnormal agency, and if\nthis is admitted the whole case for such agency falls to the ground.\nIt has been shown that Ellen was subject to hallucinations of a\nlively kind ; also that she had by some means acquired knowledge of\nthe contents of an anonymous letter addressed to her aunt, and of a\n\f90 Frank Poclmore.\nbusiness letter written by her aunt, which never reached its proper\ndestination. It will be seen, further, that if allowance is made for\nso much exaggeration and such lapses of memory as we have\nfound to occur in similar cases, all the physical phenomena alleged\nto have taken place were well within the competence of Ellen, aided\noccasionally by one of the servants, to perform by perfectly normal\nmeans. It is hardly necessary to look any further for an explanation\nof the mystery. If this explanation has not commended itself to Miss\nK., it is apparently because she has implicit confidence in her niece's\nown statement that she didn't do the things.\nCase VII.\u2014The Durweston Case.\nIn January, 1895, we received accounts of an outbreak in the\nWest Country. The following is an extract from the Western Gazette,\nJanuary 11th, 1895.\n' ' The little village of Durweston, situate about three miles from Blandford,\nhas been for some weeks past the scene of considerable excitement in conse\nquence of the supposition that one of its cottages is haunted. The cottage in\nquestion is one of a double tenement, situate at Norton\u2014a spot isolated from\nthe rest of the village, some considerable distance from the highway, and on\nthe outskirts of a wood. The cottages are owned by Viscount Portman ; his\nkeeper (named Newman) occupies one, and the other until recently has been\nin the occupation of a widow (named Mrs. Best), her daughter, and two little\norphan girls, who were boarded out to Mrs. Best by the Honourable Misses\nPitt,T)f Steepleton. It is in the latter house that these occurrences took place,\nwhich have caused such a scare in the village. More than a month since Mrs.\nBest\u2014who it may here be stated, is a most respectable woman, of a quiet,\ninoffensive disposition, and on good terms with her neighbours and the village\ngenerally\u2014became puzzled by faint knocking and scratching in various parts\nof the house, and could account for the same in no possible way. As days\npassed there was a repetition of these strange noises, which gradually\nincreased in sound, until they could be heard by the keeper Newman in his\nown house. About a fortnight since these sounds\u2014which the village black\nsmith, who was an auditor of the same, described as then being as heavy as\nsledge hammer blows\u2014were succeeded by still more startling events, for,\naccording to Mrs. Best's version, stones came violently through the bedroom\nwindows, smashing the panes, and then returned through the windows.\nThe neighbours instituted a thorough search of the surroundings to see if\nthere was any one in hiding who was playing a joke upon the woman, but\nthere was not the slightest trace of a human being, nor of footsteps.\"\nIn the latter part of January Mr. Westlake proceeded to Durweston\nand took down the statements of some of the principal witnesses\u2014\nabout 20 in all.\nThe disturbances, it appears, began on December 13th, 1894. On\nthe 18th December Mr. Newman witnessed some of the phenomena.\n\fPoltergeists. 91\nThe following is an extract from Mr. Westlake's notes of an\naccount given to him by Mr. Newman on the 23rd January, 1895 :\u2014\nOn Tuesday (December 18th) between 10 and 11 a.m., Mrs. Best sent\nfor me, and told me that Annie (the elder girl, about 13 years of age) had\nseen a boot come out of the garden plot and strike the back door, leaving a\nmuddy mark. I went into Mrs. Best's, and I saw a bead strike the\nwindow ; and then soon after a big blue bead struck the window and broke\nit, and fell back. Then a little toy-whistle struck the window, but did not\nbreak it. Then I sat down in the chair, and said, \" You're a coward, you're\na coward ; why don't you throw money ? \" I was looking at the door\nopening into the garden, it was wide open, leaving a space of 15 inches\nbetween it and the inner wall, when I saw coming from behind the door, a\nquantity of little shells. They came round the door from a height of about\n5 feet. They came one at a time, at intervals varying from half-a-minute\nto a minute. They came very slowly, and when they hit me I could hardly\nfeel them. With the shells came two thimbles. They came so slowly, that\nin the ordinary way they would have dropped long before they reached me.\nThey came from a point, some, I think, a trifle higher, and some no higher,\nthan my head. Both the thimbles struck my hat. Some missed my head\nand went just past, and fell down slantingwise (not as if suddenly dropped).\nThose that struck me fell straight down.\nThe two children were all the time in the same room with me.\nThen right from behind me a slate pencil came as if from the copper.\nThe pencil was about 2i inches long, and went slowly on a slant to a bowl\non the floor in the pantry ; and another piece went just in the same\ndirection just over the bowl, and went into a pot of dirty water.\nAnd a hasp, like the hasp of a glove, was dropped into my lap from a\npoint above the level of my head.\nI never saw any of the things begin to move. I saw some of them just\nafter they were started. Time was somewhere between 10 and 11 a.m. \u2014a\nnice clear day ; don't remember whether there was sunlight.\nA boot came then in from outside the door. It came in moving along\na foot above the ground, and pitched down. The boot had been lying right\nin front of the door, where it had previously fallen. This boot came\ntowards me, and fell down just at my side. Mrs. Best took it and threw it\nout\u2014it was an old dirty boot from off the garden plot (it was a woman's\nboot). I think the boot moved about as slow as the others, but cannot\nquite remember. It finally fell softly.\nAfter the boot was thrown out into the garden, I went out and put my\nfoot on it, and said, \"I defy anything to move this boot.\" Just as I\nstepped off, it rose up behind me and knocked my hat off ; there was no one\nbehind me. The boot and the hat fell down together.\nA few days later the two children, with their foster-mother, Mrs.\nBest\u2014a woman, it should be said, of about 60 years\u2014went to stay in\nMr. Newman's cottage for some days. Whilst they were there the\nRector of Durweston, the Rev. W. M. Anderson, came to witness the\nphenomena. On his first visit (Friday, the 4th January, 1895) nothing\n\f92 Frank Podmore.\ntook place. On Thursday, January 10th, he went again, accompanied\nby Mr. Sheppard, the schoolmaster. Mrs. Best took the two children\nupstairs and put them to bed, herself lying down in the bed with\nthem. The subjoined chart shows the disposition of the furniture :\u2014\nMRS.

Mr. Sheppard went outside the house to see that\nno one was playing tricks from outside, whilst the Rector remained\nwithin, the noises still continuing. Subjoined is an extract from Mr.\nAnderson's account, written on the 25th January, 1895, of the events\nof that evening :\u2014\nI put my ear and hand to the wall, but could not detect any vibration ;\nbut when resting my hand on the rail at the bottom of the bed, I could\ndistinctly feel a vibration varying according to the loudness of the\nknocking. It is, perhaps, needless to say that I searched the room and the\nhouse, also Mrs. Best's house from top to bottom. Occasionally there\n.was a noise in the wall, as if some one were scratching with their nails.\nThis scratching also appeared to be going on in the mattress of the bed,\n.although I am sure it was not produced by any of the three occupants of\nthe bed, as I could see their hands, and watched them very closely all the\ntime.\nThere was a lighted lamp, a small hand lamp giving a good light, on the\nwashstand the whole time. When the rapping first began, I noticed that\nit frequently ceased when I came into the room, but after a short time it\nmade no difference, and was loud and continuous when every inmate of the\nhouse was in the room. About 2.15 a.m. it was suggested by some one, I\nbelieve Mr. Sheppard, tha* the \"Agency\" should be asked whether it\nwould write any communication on a slate ; the number of raps requested\nfor an affirmative were given. There was no slate in the Newmans' house,\nbut Mrs. Best told us where we should find,one in her house. Newman\nMr. Sheppard, and myself went into her house, found the slate and a piece\nof pencil, and returned. In reply to several questions as to where the slate\nwas to be placed, the number of knocks asked for was given for the window-\nsill (inside, of course), the sill being some 9 or 10 inches wide. I may\nmention that every conceivable place in the room was suggested one after\nthe other, but the right number of raps was not given, but a short, sharp\nknock which seemed always to be given for a negative. We almost gave up\nat this point, until as an afterthought I suggested the window-sill, which was\nat once accepted. The next question was as to who was to remain in the\nroom, and according to the knocks every one was to leave, except the two\nchildren and Mrs. Best ; the light was also to be removed. The sign to be\ngiven when the writing was finished was four raps. We all retired down\nthe stairs, which are about ten in number and straight. I remained at the\nbottom of the stairs, with the bedroom door wide open, it was very dark at\nthe time. Some 15 seconds elapsed, and amid perfect silence we all heard\nthe pencil scratching on the slate. Mrs. Best gave a suppressed groan,\nwhich I could distinctly hear. Four sharp raps were given almost simul\ntaneously with the dropping of the pencil on the slate, and Mrs. Best gave\na loud, screaming call, \" Come.\" I was in the room instantly ; the whole\nthing taking less time than it would take to read this description. The\nlight showed some unmeaning scratches on the slate. We asked for some\nthing legible, which was promised in the usual way. It was with the\ngreatest difficulty that we could persuade Mrs. Best to remain in the room\n\f94 Frank Podmore.\na second time, but we prevailed on her to do so, I promising to remain on\nthe stairs. The second time a flourish [something like this] was on the\nslate\u2014\nOnly the curves were beautifully drawn with firm bold lines, such as no-\nchild could produce. The same proceedings took place a third time, when\nM\n1\nwas found on the slate. The fourth time\nMONY\nand the fifth time\nO\nGARDEN\nO\nEvery time I was nearer to the bedroom door, which was wide open and\nopposite the window. The last two or three times I was so close that I\ncould almost hear Mrs. Best breathe, the silence being death-like. The-\ndightest movement by any one in the bed would have been detected by me-\nin a moment, and I am absolutely certain that the writing could not have\nbeen done by any one in the room without my knowing it. On one occasion\nthe pencil rolled off on to the floor, and was broken in two pieces.\nMrs. Best cannot write ; the younger child cannot, she was asleep ;\nAnnie Cleave can. I told Mrs. Best that I was myself convinced that no one\nhad moved in the bed, much less left it, but I said people would say such\nhad been the case. She said she was prepared to take a solemn oath that\nnone of them had moved or left the bed, which was some 4 ft. or more from\nthe window.\nWe could get no more replies in the way of raps, and nothing more was\nheard that night. Mr. Sheppard and I left at ten minutes to three.\nI should like to say a word about the characters of those who have-\nwitnessed and heard these abnormal phenomena. With one exception\n(Spinney) they are all known to me personally, and the veracity and honesty\nof them all is beyond question. Mrs. Best is an earnest Christian woman,,\nwho bears perhaps the highest character in the village.\nLater, the children were taken to another house in the village,\nwhere raps and other noises were heard ; and were finally separated,\nthe elder child, Annie, being removed to another village, Iwerne*\nMinster, to the house of a single woman. There the disturbance still\n\fPoltergeists. 95\ncontinued : noises were heard, generally on the outer walls of the\nhouse ; a big stone was flung on the roof of the porch ; and snowdrops\nwere dug up out of the garden and flung about. On March 7th, Miss\nM. H. Mason, Local Government Board Inspector of Boarded-out\nchildren, came down and took the child Annie to stay in her flat in\nLondon for a week. No disturbance worth recording occurred during\nher stay in London.\nMiss Mason had the child examined by a doctor, who pronounced\nher of a markedly consumptive tendency, and apparently hysterical.\nA sister two years older than herself, has since died from consumption.\nAccording to another witness, Annie, during the earlier disturbances,\nsaw a queer animal with green head and green eyes, and a big bushy\ntail, sitting up and pulling her doll to pieces with its paws. Gertie,\nthe younger girl, she added, saw the same apparition when Annie\ncalled to her.\nIt will be observed that the account given by the educated\nwitness, Mr. Anderson, of the phenomena observed by himself is quite\ncompatible with trickery on the part of the children. But this\nsupposition implies in Mrs. Best either connivance or, in the alterna\ntive, a degree of stupidity which it is difficult to credit. This is a\nreal difficulty ; since Mrs. Best, a Nonconformist, was by all her\nfellow-villagers, even including the Rector, looked upon as a thoroughly\nrespectable woman ; and the sequel of the outbreak, at any rate, was\nmost detrimental to her interests, since she lost in the girl Annie a\nlucrative lodger, who had been with her for nearly four years.\nAs regards the things vouched for by Newman, it should be observed\nthat the account was not committed to writing until 5 weeks after the\nevents.\nOn the whole I think it would be difficult, on the evidence obtain\nable, to substantiate in this case a theory of supernormal agency.1\nCase VIII.\u2014The Ham Case.\nEarly in February, 1895, we received intelligence of a Polter\ngeist at Ham, a little village near Hungerford, in Berkshire. The\nfollowing extract from a letter written by a local clergyman will give\nsome idea of how the matter was regarded in the neighbourhood.\n\"Froxfield Vicarage, Hungerford, Berks.\n\"Janiutry 31st, 1895.\n\" There is a veritable ghost at Ham ; it has overturned boots and shoes\nfrom the slab of an oven on to the hob\u2014overturned a stool, and pitched the\n1 Mr. Westlake proposes to give a fuller account of his investigations in this case\nin an early number of the Journal.\n\f96 Frank Podmore.\ncat on it into the fire \u2014upset tables and all sorts of things. The tenant's\nname is Turner, and he works for Mr. Woodman. Woodman has put the\nman into an adjacent, but not adjoining, house, and has had the floor of the\nhouse taken up, but has not discovered the cause, and now the same pranks\nare going on in the house into which the people have removed. It is no\ndelusion\u2014it takes place in broad daylight before people's eyes, and Edith\nWoodman saw a table overturned on Tuesday. No one can explain it\u2014it is\nquite a mystery, and is causing great excitement through the country-side ;\npeople from Marlborough, Hungerford and Froxfield visit the scene of these\noperations. They say that the people have a daughter who is eccentric and\ndeformed.\"\nThe ghost appears to have been particularly active on the evening\nof January 24th. Appended are extracts from two letters chronicling\nthe events of this remarkable evening. The first witness is the local\nconstable ; he appends to his letter a plan of the room.\nFrom Police Constable H.

The first thing I saw was\nthe armchair fall over on its side. After a few minutes I saw one of the\nkitchen chairs fall forwards. The next I saw was a four-legged stool which\nwas standing in the chimney corner that fell over on its side into the fire.\nNo one was near enough to touch either when it fell. I saw the things\nwhen [they ?] were falling, and [they ?] came over with great force. Polly\nTurner was at this time with her father the other side of the house by the\noven. Some time after this Polly Turner came out into the middle of the\nroom near where I was, ( there were two kitchen chairs standing about 2\nyards from me, [near the pantry] one had books and a workbox on it). Polly\nwent near the chair, and put out her hand to take a book, but before she\ncould take it, over went the chair and nearly fell on the girl. It fell\ntowards her, but so as to just miss her, and she ran away apparently\nfrightened. The armchair fell away from the girl, but the other three\nkitchen chairs came towards her. The only time that I saw her anywhere\nnear the chairs was, as I said, when she went to get a book, and the chair\nfell before she could reach it. I should say that during the time I was\nthere, Polly was three yards away from the chairs when they fell down, except\nthe time I mentioned. I saw them go down several times ; they simply\nfell down, and there remained till one of the party put them up again.\nThe persons present in the room were P.C. H. King, Mr. Thos. Martin,\nMr. F. H. Grist, Mr. Thos. Frances, Ed. Stockwell, Simon Cook, Wm.\nWhiter, Abel Cumings, Jesse Rolfe, and Mr. Maggs, and Turner's family.\nFrom Mr. J. Rolfe.\nHam, Hungerford. February 14th, 1895.\nI am writing to give you all information of what I saw on January 24th,\nbetween a quarter past nine o'clock and twelve o'clock p.m., in Mr. Turner's\nhouse. The first thing I saw was the oven's lid fall, and then the stool\nwith two cats sat upon it, and it threw the cats into the fire. There was not\nmuch fire. The next thing that went over was one of the chairs against\nthe pantry. They both went over, but it was about five minutes between.\nThen I saw the armchair go over, and I saw the oven's lid fall several times,\nand the stool and chairs when no one was near them. They went over with\ngreat force, no one could throw them over so swift. The things went\nstraight over. I did not see them start, for when I was looking at one thing\nto see it go over, one of the others went over. The little girl Polly was\nnot close to throw it over. Her father or her brother was nursing her\nmost of the time I was there. Mr. Turner was sitting in the chair close\nto the oven most of the time, and the other people were standing round\nby the table, and sometimes one or two were around by the armchair,\nbut not [so] close but what it could fall. I have made a x as near as I\ncould where the people stood when the things went over. It could not have\nbeen possible for the little girl Polly to have thrown it over.\nWe have received similar accounts of the disturbances on that even\ning from Mr. Cumings and Mr. Stockwell. Another witness, Mr.\nMartin, saw the furniture moving on two occasions. He writes :\u2014\n\" There were other persons present, standing all about the room,\nii\n\f98 Frank Podmore.\nbut not very near the chairs. I am quite sure the child did not touch\nthem, they seemed to fall as she passed them. The armchair fell on\nits side, the others forward. It was between 10 and 11 o'clock in the\nevening.\" Another witness, Mr. James Kavanagh, describes some\nmovements which he saw after the Turner family had moved to\nanother house. He writes\u2014\nHaving heard so many reports of table and chairs turning over, I deter\nmined to visit and so satisfy my curiosity.\nAbout a fortnight ago I went to the house at 4.30 p.m. and stood\nat place marked K. Nothing occurred for about ten minutes, when I\nheard the stool under the table turn over. The boy Turner replaced it.\nIn a few minutes it toppled over again. A third time it did the same,\nand each time towards the door. In a short time I observed the chair\n(marked in plan) turn over, likewise towards the door. The chair was\nfully 5 or 6 feet from me.\nI am confident no one moved it. I examined the chair well to see if there\nwas any trickery, as I have always been averse to anything of the sort.\nHam N.

On the morning\nfollowing his arrival he wrote as follows :\u2014\nLetter I.\nPost Office, Ham, Hungerford, Berks, February 9th, 1895.\nNothing is alleged in this case but the frequent movements of objects\n(except that Mrs. Turner says that once she saw a woman's face in the oven).\nIt is one of those baffling cases where the thing won't work, or only incon\nclusively, in the presence of strangers. At least that was my experience\nlast evening ; some local observers have had better success, I hear. Never\ntheless I think it to be genuine from the hundred and one indications which\none gathers when talking with the folks around their hearth\u2014the primitive\nstance. Polly, a little dwarfed black-haired girl, turning 12, sits in the\nchimney corner and nurses the cats Topsy and Titit\u2014she is the centre of\nforce\u2014then (in the absence of strangers) the coals fly about and all moveable\nobjects are thrown down ad libitum, and ad nauseam according to their\naccount.\nIt has been a nine days' wonder, and local interest (all unintelligent) is\ndying.\nThe Turners, however, say that things are as active as ever (last evening,\ne.g.) The report that they have made money out of it seems to be untrue.\nOn the same day, a few hours later, Mr. Westlake writes as\nfollows :\u2014-\nLetter II.\nThe \" Ham Ghost \" is a humbug note, whatever it may have been. I\nmade friends with the cats, and their mistress, poor child, gave me a private\nsitting of some 2 or 3 hours, in the course of which she moved between\n40 and 50 objects when she thought I wasn't looking (her plan being to watch\nme till I looked away.) However, I saw her in contact with the objects with\nevery degree of distinctness, and on se . en (at least) occasions by simple\ndevices I had a clear view of her hands in contact with the objects and\nsaw them quickly moved. I entered into the spirit of the thing, and\nsaid nothing to any one, beyond suggesting to the lady (Miss Woodman) at\nthe Manor House that the affair would probably cease if no further attention\nwere paid to it, and that some one would do well to watch the child.\nShe is a dwarf, aged 12, who has only lately learned to walk, pale, with\nlong, black hair and eyes, very sharp, and watches one like a cat a mouse.\nHer mother is said never to leave the house or to allow the child to do so.\nBut it is curious that a little child should succeed in deceiving a whole\ncountry side, and especially in deceiving her parents (for I do not think they\nare implicated ;\u2014if they have suspicions, they smother them ; they appear\ngenuinely worried.) The mother would sometimes ask the child, after a\nparticularly barefaced \" upset,\" whether she did it, and she always denied.\nMr. Westlake has kindly furnished the following additional particu\nlars of what he observed :\u2014\"After posting my first letter, I went to the\nTurners' and sat on a bench in front of the fire. No one else was present\nh 2\n\f100 Frank Podmore.\nbesides the child. She sat on a low stool in the chimney on the right\nof the fire. On the other side of the hearth there was a brick oven in\nwhich, much to Polly's interest, I placed a dish of flour, arguing that a\npower capable of discharging the contents of the oven (one of the first\ndisturbances) might be able to impress the flour. After a time I went to\nthe oven to see how the flour was getting on, stooping slightly to look in,\nbut kept my eyes on the child's hands, looking at them under my right\narm. I saw her hand stealing down towards a stick that was projecting\nfrom the fire; I moved slightly and the hand was withdrawn. Next time\nI was careful to make no movement and saw her hand jerk the brand\nout on to the floor. She cried out. I expressed interest and astonish\nment ; and her mother came in and cleared up the debris. This was\nrepeated several times, and one or two large sticks ready for burning\nwhich stood near the child were thrown down. Then a kettle which\nwas hanging on a hook and chain was jerked off the hook on to the fire.\nThis was repeated. As the kettle refused to stay on its hook, the\nmother placed it on the hearth, but it was soon overturned on to the\nfloor and upset. After this I was sitting on the bench which stood\nfacing the fire in front of the table. I had placed my hat on the table\nbehind me. The little girl was standing near me on my right hand.\nPresently the hat was thrown down on the ground. I did not on the\nfirst occasion see the girl's movements, but later, by seeming to look in\nanother direction, I saw her hand sweep the hat off on to the floor.\nThis I saw at least twice. A Windsor chair near the girl was then\nupset more than once, falling away from her. On one occasion I saw\nher push the chair over with both hands. As she was looking away\nfrom me, I got a nearly complete view. After one of these performances\nthe mother came in and asked the girl if she had done it, but she\ndenied it.\"\nWith Mr. Westlake's observations it is interesting to compare\nthe following account by Mr. E. N. Bennett, of Hertford College,\nOxford :\u2014\nA week after Mr. Westlake's visit to Ham, I went over from Oxford and\nstayed for nearly five hours in the Turners' cottage, viz., from 5 to 9.50 p.m.\nDuring this time certain phenomena occurred. A table moved some 4\ninches along the floor ; a stool, upon which a little girl (the supposed\nmedium) sat, was repeatedly jerked about and on one occasion so completely\nas to upset her upon the floor ; a teapot full of tea fell forward violently\nupon the floor from a raised, but firm and level, hearth ; and, finally, a chair\nplaced by myself some 10 or 12 inches from the child in question moved\ntowards her four times.\nWith respect to the above phenomena, I noticed\u2014a. That whenever\nthey occurred the child was in very close proximity to the material objects\naffected. \/3. That none of these movements were initiated when I was\nlooking directly at the child and the furniture near her.\n\fPoltergeists. 101\nDuring the latter part of my time in the cottage, I placed the child quite\napart from the rest of the family, upon a stool, and made her clasp her\nhands before her, and also put her feet upon one of mine. Two movements\nof furniture then took place, but in one case, her hands, I noticed, were\nmomentarily unclasped, and in the other, one of her feet left my boot for\nan instant.\nMy own impression is, certainly, that the movements I witnessed were\nproduced by trickery, although I was unable to actually detect the\nfraudulent means employed. The child seems to combine with a defective\nintelligence a considerable amount of cunning, while the garrulity and\nexaggerated statements of the mother deprive her testimony of any value.\nIn the three cases which follow, the \" medium \" or person through\nwhose agency, physical or psychical, the manifestations were brought\nabout, was of superior education and social position to the little\nrustics with whom we have chiefly been concerned hitherto. In the\nfirst case, which I abridge from my own fuller statement written at\nthe time, we have direct confessions of trickery from two persons :\nand there is no reason to doubt that the whole of the phenomena\nattested were due to trickery. Indeed, no one in the house seems to\nhave been deceived in the matter, except the lady upon whose credulity\nher guests appear to have practised.\nCase IX.\nIn the autumn of 1894, Mrs. B., a lady living in a provincial town,\ngave me an account of certain curious incidents which had recently\ntaken place in her house. The occupants of the house\u2014an old one\u2014\nconsisted, besides Mrs. B. and her family, of a widow lady, Mrs. D.,\nand her two children\u2014a girl of about 20, C. D., and a boy of 15, E. D.\nMrs. B., C. D., and E. D. had been in the habit of trying experi\nments with planchette in the evening. Planchette had given them to\nunderstand that the house was haunted by four spirits, a wicked\nmarquis, a wicked monk, a lay desperado, and a virtuous and beautiful\nyoung lady. These had, all four, met with violent deaths (minutely\ndescribed by planchette) at one another's hands in the house. These\nspirits wrote, through planchette, of treasure concealed in the house; of a\nhidden chamber ; and many other matters. They also promised through\nplanchette, and ultimately gave, objective proofs of their presence.\nAmongst other proofs were the following :\u2014(1) One evening after dark\nMrs. B., in accordance with directions received through planchette,\nwent with C. D. and E. D. to the old oak tree in the garden, and\nstanding with the girl and boy on either side, holding a hand of each,\nshe distinctly heard a stone strike the garden-roller a few feet off. The\nphenomenon was repeated twice ; and her companions solemnly assured\nher that they had no part in the performance.\n\f102 Frank Podmore.\n(2) On another occasion, sitting up in a bedroom (her son's) at the\ntop of the house in the dark, with only E. D. in the room, Mrs. B. was\nstruck by a stone on the temple, heard objects thrown about the room,\nfelt an arm put through hers, and so on. Some of these phenomena\nalso occurred when she was alone in the room\u2014but with the door, I\ngathered, not shut.\n(3) Mrs. B. one morning placed a white chrysanthemum bouquet\non the boughs of the oak tree. It disappeared shortly afterwards ;\nand on the next morning two other small bouquets were found there.\nMrs. B. asked for whom these were intended, and went away, leaving\npencil and paper. On her return she found the paper torn in half, and\nthe initials of her own Christian name, and that of C. D., written on\nthe two halves respectively, with a bouquet on each half.\n(4) About this time a new secret chamber was discovered, with the\nskeleton of a cat crouching in act to spring, and the skeleton of a\nwoman. Asked more particularly about the latter, Mrs. B. said :\n\" Well, at least, a skull and some bones\u2014but it was a woman's skull.\"\nA few days after receiving this account, I went down by invitation\nto the house. I saw Mrs. D. and her two children, and received from\nthem ungrudging corroboration of Mrs. B.'s marvellous story. In\nE. D.'s company I penetrated the secret chamber, and found there the\nmummified skeleton of what might have been a cat\u2014but nothing else.\nIn removing the stains left by this exploit from my person, I contrived\na tete-a-tete interview with E. D. I at once asked him, \" How much did\nyou do of all these things 1\" He replied, \" Oh, not much ; I only did\na few little things.\" Pressed on particular points, he admitted having\nthrown one stone at the garden-roller, and having also thrown a\ntrouser-button against the wall when sitting alone in the bedroom with\nMrs. B. He denied having produced the other phenomena on those\noccasions. Asked as to the bouquets, he said he had not placed them\non the tree. Pressed a little more, he said, \" If I did it, it must have\nbeen without knowing it.\" (This without any suggestion from me as\nto possible somnambulism, or unconscious action.) He assured me that\nhis sister had had no hand in this matter. I could not get any more\nout of him, as he was shortly after called away.\nI subsequently learnt from his mother that E. D. was so nervous\nand delicate that he slept in her room at night ; that he was not\nallowed to do much mental work ; that he was subject to attacks of\nsomnambulism ; and had, indeed, fallen into a semi-conscious state only\na few days before, during a lesson in carpentry.\nSubsequently Miss C. D., whilst denying any complicity with her\nbrother in the \" physical phenomena,\" admitted having deliberately\nco-operated with him in working planchette, and writing answers of\ntheir own invention to Mrs. B.'s questions.\n\fPoltergeists. 103\nThese things may seem too foolish to he worth recording. I have\nrecorded them because\u2014inoredible as it must seem\u2014Mrs. B., an\neducated woman, did unquestionably believe that she was in communi\ncation, through planchette, with four spirits, who looked to her for help\nand guidance ; and saw in a schoolboy's silly tricks special manifesta\ntions of spirit power vouchsafed for her enlightenment. On the whole,\nMrs. B. was, perhaps, only a little more credulous than some of the\nother witnesses to the doings of Poltergeists.\nCase X.\nThe house in which the phenomena to be described took place is\na small terrace-house in a town in the south of England, occupied by\nMr. and Mrs. B. and their family. The younger daughter, Alice,\nis barely 1 2. She is very tall and pale, and has apparently outgrown\nher strength ; and is compelled, under medical advice, to lie down on\nher bed for an hour or two every afternoon. She impressed me, on my\nvisit to the house, as being very intelligent, energetic and clever beyond\nher years.\nIn the summer of 18\u2014\u2014 the servant complained of hearing strange\nnoises in the house, and shadows behind her, and occasionally of being\ntouched. In the course of the same year Mrs. B. on one occasion\nheard a tremendous blow on the door of a room in which she was\nsitting ; and on another occasion saw part of a figure clothed in a print\ndress through the half-open door of the dining-room.\nIn the autumn of the following year, however, the phenomena\nwere very frequent and striking. The manifestations were of two kinds :\n(1) physical disturbances, (2) auditory and visual phenomena, which\nmay have been hallucinations. It will be convenient first to consider the\nphysical phenomena. If we omit such matters as blows on doors, the\nviolent slamming of half-opened doors, and the fall of a picture from its\nnail, the most striking physical phenomena are the following :\u2014\nI cite these in the order in which they are given in the narrative\nfurnished by Mr. B. and other members of the family. (1) Alice,\nwhen alone in her room, found some newly-shed blood on the floor.\n(2) Alice, entering her bedroom, closely followed by Miss K., an\ninmate of the house, found that her water-jug had been quite recently\nupset on the floor. (3) A water-jug was again found upset in the\nsame bedroom, Alice being in the room alone at the time. (4) Mrs.\nB., in stooping down to kiss her daughter Alice good-night, felt\ndistinctly a hand laid on her back. (5) A charwoman complained\nthat a saucepan was dragged from her hand and dashed down on the\nstove. (6) A chair was moved in Mrs. B's room, Alice being the only\nother person present. (7) A picture was seen to move from its\n\f104 Frank Podmore.\nposition on the wall of the dining room to the extent of about 4 inches.\nIt then, when commanded by Mrs. B., in the name of the Trinity,\nreturned slowly to its original position. The witnesses to this\nphenomenon were Mrs. B., Alice, and Miss K. (8) A card-table, at\nwhich Mrs. B., Miss K., Miss B.,and Alice were seated, moved sharply\nand struck Miss K. on the arm. (9) Two little boys were having\ntea with Alice in the dining-room. One of the little boys had first his\nleg and then his throat sharply pinched.\nIt is, perhaps, not uncharitable to suggest that the fall of the\nsaucepan may have been due to the clumsiness of the charwoman, and\nthat the other disturbances were caused by Alice, by ordinary physical\nmeans. The only incident which, on this interpretation, offers any\ndifficulty is the movement of the picture on the wall of the dining-\nroom. This may have been moved by a string ; though I could find no\ntrace either on the picture itself or on the adjacent wall of any such\nmeans having been used. Mrs. B. could not remember in what part\nof the room Alice was standing during the phenomenon ; and Miss K.\nand Mrs. B. assigned different positions to Mrs. B. herself. I think it\nnot impossible that the whole movement was imaginary.\nThe visual and auditory phenomena were very curious and\ninteresting. Mrs. B and Miss K. at various times\u2014sometimes together\n\u2014heard voices speaking, moans, cries, rappings, footsteps, and loud\nnoises. Some of these noises\u2014the sounds of articulate sentences, for\ninstance\u2014were apparently hallucinatory. There were also many visual\nhallucinations. Miss K., on two occasions, saw a hand\u2014in one case, on\nthe glass of a bookcase. Mrs. B., besides the hallucination of a woman's\ndress already referred to, saw, when in bed, a brilliant disc of white\nlight and a dazzling white garment ; she also saw a shadowy black form\non suddenly entering a dark room. She saw, in the middle of the after\nnoon, a lovely white bird, larger than a dove, gliding across the upper\nhall. Going up the stairs shortly after the vision, Mrs. B. saw a\nshower of gold and silver flakes. Alice, who accompanied her, saw\nthem too, and went to fetch the charwoman. The charwoman\n\" thought it rather pretty, and supposed it was motes.\" Perhaps\nit was.\nAlice also recited several experiences of her own, which may,\nperhaps, be classed as hallucinations ; she was thumped on the back ;\nshe felt something push against her in going upstairs ; she heard\nmoans, voices and other noises ; and once, when lying down on her\nbed in the afternoon, she heard the sound of paper scraping on the\nwall, and, looking up, saw a coloured ball of paper fall from the ceiling\nand disappear in the basin. No such ball could be found.\nIt should be added that the B. family regard the phenomena as\ninexplicable.\n\fPoltergeists. 105\nCase XT.\nIn this case I am precluded from giving full details of the various\nincidents. Lest, however, it should be thought that the brief summary\nwhich follows presents an ex parte statement of the circumstances, I am\npermitted to say that Professor and Mrs. Sidgwick, who are acquainted\nwith the case, agree with my general conclusions. The occupants of\nthe house, which was the scene of these incidents, were a family whom\nI will call Z. The family included a grown-up son, Y. Z. The disturb\nances, which were very frequent, and extended with uneven intervals\nover a period of about twelve months, began soon after the appearance\nin the house of a young lady visitor, Miss Q. The first outbreak lasted\nfor some weeks, and ceased on the day of Miss Q.'s departure. The\ndisturbances were striking and various. They included, besides loud\nnoises, slamming of doors, and sound of footsteps, &c., frequent physical\nmovements, such as the displacement of furniture, occasional breakage\nof crockery, the throwing about of boots, toilet necessaries, and articles\nof clothing.\nWe have been furnished with a long series of letters and documents\nwritten by members of the family, minutely describing the earlier dis\nturbances. I have analysed the record of the events which took place\nduring Miss Q.'s first visit. I find that there were sixty-six disturb\nances involving movements of material objects during the period of a\nfortnight. On thirty-four of the sixty-six occasions, Y. Z. and Q.,\neither together or separately, were the first to arrive on the scene of the\ndisturbance ; and in most of the thirty-four cases, they were the sole\nwitnesses that any movements had taken place, the rest of the house\nhold being generally contented to accept their report. In the\nremaining thirty-two instances, in which the movements were testified\nto by other members of the household, the disturbances consisted\nsometimes of furniture being found by the servant in the morning\ndisplaced, Y. Z. himself having found it similarly displaced on the\nprevious evening and having, according to his own statement, replaced\nit ; in other cases furniture was displaced in rooms which Y. Z. or\nQ. had recently passed through ; or objects were thrown from, or from\nthe direction of, Q.'s bedroom when she was in the room alone. In a\nfew cases the description of the occurrence is not sufficiently detailed\nto enable one to judge of the positions and movements of the persons\nconcerned. On two occasions only are movements recorded as actually\ntaking place in the presence of other members of the household. Thus,\non one occasion a small object was thrown across the room, in which\nall the household except the servants were seated. It is not stated\nthat any one saw it in the air. On two or three other occasions move\nments of small objects are reported to have taken place when Y. Z,\n\f106 Frank Podmore.\nand Q. were in remote parts of the house. But the evidence for these\nmovements is by no means clear; and as Y. Z. or Q., and possibly\nboth, appear to have assisted in drawing up the reports, little reliance\ncan be placed upon the accounts given. Nothing is reported as\u25a0-\ntaking place when both Q. and Y. Z. were absent from the house\u2014\nexcept a few noises, and the opening of a cupboard door. With\nthe trifling exceptions mentioned above, nothing seems to have\noccurred during the fourteen days which, even as described by the\nfamily, could not readily have been produced by Q. or Y. Z. by very\nsimple means. \u25a0\nSome time after Q.'s departure, the phenomena recommenced. But\nthey now centred round Y. Z. exclusively, and nothing is recorded which\ncould not readily have been produced through his agency. As the\nphenomena still continued at intervals, various members of the Society\n\u2014of whom I was one \u2014went to investigate the case. My own visit was\nunfruitful. But one of my cjlleagues, Mr. T., was more fortunate. His\nvisit happened to coincide with a visit from Miss Q. After Miss Q. had\nretired to her room, various articles were thrown from the direction\nof her door when no one was watching ; and various small pieces of\nfurniture were displaced immediately outside her room ; her door waa\nheard to open several times and various objects were thrown out. Miss-\nQ. professed to have had no hand in these doings, and not even to know\nwhen they took place. Nothing whatever occurred when Mr. T. was\nwatching the door.\nFinally, Q. professed that she was too disturbed to keep in her\nroom, and went downstairs. Various articles of furniture were then\nmoved in the ground-floor rooms, some in the immediate vicinity of\nQ., others in more remote rooms, to which, however, she could readily\nhave had access undetected. Similar phenomena were repeated on\nthe following night. It was observed that in no single instance did\nany disturbances take place which could not readily have been produced\nby Q. Moreover, certain curious limitations to the phenomena were\nobserved. Miss Q.'s room had two doors. The one was locked on the\noutside through the greater part of the disturbances ; of the other she\nherself had the key. Nothing took place outside the locked door ; but\nmany objects were moved outside the other door. Finally, on the\nsecond night, after many things had been thrown out from the unlocked\ndoor, and many movements had taken place in its vicinity, Miss Q. was\nrequested to stand close to the locked door. The lights were put out,\nand the request was then made that some movement should take place\nin the neighbourhood of the other door, i.e., at a distance of some yards\nfrom Q. The investigators waited twenty minutes, but nothing more\ntook place. Q. left the house the next day, the phenomena ceasing with\nher departure.\n\fPoltergeists. 107\nOne other series of disturbances may perhaps be referred to, since\nthe manifestations exhibited a marked and most instructive change of\ncharacter. When Q. or Y. Z. were staying in the house, the disturb\nances had taken the form of violent banging of doors, displacement of\nfurniture and throwing about of small objects, generally accompanied\nwith a good deal of noise. During the period now under consideration,\nY. Z. was away, and Q., though apparently about the house nearly\nevery day, was not sleeping there ; and the disturbances were of a much\nmilder type. They consisted, in fact, almost exclusively of the noise\nless displacement and stealthy disappearance of small objects, their\nhiding place being often discovered by Q. herself.\nWith one exception, which, it may be suggested, was possibly due\nto mal observation on the part of the reporter, there was nothing to\nindicate at what time the movements took place, or to forbid the\nsupposition that they actually occurred in Miss Q.'s presence, though\nthe fact of the movement was not in some cases discovered for hours\nor days afterwards.\nAfter these occurrences, the phenomena ceased almost entirely, and\ndid not recommence until some months later, when there were again\na few disturbances of the same general character, i.e., movements of\nfurniture, and throwing about of small objects in the immediate\nneighbourhood of Y. Z. (Q. was not at that time in the house.)\nFrom first to last, with a few insignificant exceptions, the whole\nof the disturbances could readily have been produced by Miss Q.\nor Y. Z., acting sometimes singly and sometimes in concert. The\nbelief of the Z. family and their friends that they were not so\nproduced rests almost exclusively on their conviction of the good\nfaith of Miss Q. and of Y. Z.\nMr. T. writes :\u2014\nThe disturbances (about 70 ?) which occurred while I was in the house\ncould all have been done by Miss Q. or Y. Z.\u2014and that without any\nparticular skill or artifice\u2014but as I obtained no direct evidence as to how\nthey were produced, I have no belief one way or the other. If genuine,\nthey simply rest on the word of those persons. If fraudulent, I would\nsuggest that they probably grew from an undesigned beginning into a hoax,\nexciting to the youthful authors, whose success encouraged them to push it\nas far as possible, regardless of the serious trouble and worry to Mrs. Z.\nIt may be added that, so far as I am aware, no signs of\nabnormality have been detected in either of these two persons ; and\nthat, on the assumption that they were the authors of these disturb\nances, no adequate motive has been suggested for their conduct,\nunless, indeed, the alleged desire of Y. Z. to transport the family to\na more congenial neighbourhood can be held to constitute such a\nmotive.\n\f108 Frank Podmore.\nThese eleven cases are the only instances in which we have full\nreports of personal investigation by representatives of the Society\nsince its foundation in 1882. Other cases have indeed from time to\ntime been brought to our notice, and enquiries have in some cases been\nmade, but no report has been presented to the Society. Accounts\nhave been sent to us, however, of a few other cases, in which fraud has\nbeen detected or inferred with some degree of probability. Thus a lady\nwrites to us from Bournemouth, in November, 1889, that a fortnight\nafter the appearance in her house\u2014a small private boarding-house\u2014\nof a new cook, disturbances of various kinds took place. Bells were\nmysteriously rung ; a heavy cellar-grating was several times thrown\ndown ; a leg of mutton made its appearance in inappropriate situations ;\nthe kitchen clock stopped ; bedsteads, a chest of drawers, tin cans, a\nwaste paper basket, and other articles of furniture were repeatedly\ndisplaced. The servants' bedrooms, in particular, were the scene of\nmany disturbances. This state of things continued for a week.\nDuring ail this time the lady of the house and her fellow inmates\ntook various precautions, and kept a close watch on the servants,\nwithout being able to discover any suspicious movements. Finally, on\nthe eighth day, their patience was rewarded. One of the daughters of\nthe house, after having ascertained that the furniture in the upper\nrooms was undisturbed and in its proper position, kept a close watch\nupon the stairs leading up to the servants' quarters. Looking through\na keyhole she saw the new cook, Mary, go stealthily upstairs, and\nheard various movements in the room overhead. When Mary had\nretreated, Miss Lucy B. went upstairs and found the furniture\ndisarranged in precisely the same way as it had been many times\nbefore during the previous week. Asked whether she had been\nupstairs during the morning, Mary said no. She further denied all\nknowledge of the whereabouts of a key belonging to a bedroom door\nwhich had been found in the course of the day to be locked. Under a\nthreat of police, however, she revealed the hiding-place of the key.\nMrs. B. states that it was never discovered by what means Mary\nsucceeded in ringing the bells without detection. Mary is described\nas a girl of about 17 ; very pretty, pleasant and quiet in manner and\nspeech. In the next case, also, a servant who is described \"as rather\nsmarter and sharper than the average country girl,\" was caught in the\nact of causing disturbances.\nMr. James Gardner writes to us :\u2014\nJanuary 25th, 1896.\nIn reply to your letter respecting noises at Edgeworth Rectory, I shall be\npleased to tell you all I know, although it must be nearly 20 years ago. Mr.\nand Mrs. Shaw were away from home, and during their absence strange\nnoises, such as scraping and moaning, were heard at the Rectory, which\n\fPoltergeists. 109\nfrightened the servants in the house, and they told the gardener, who stayed\nin the house the next night and was equally puzzled as to cause of noise. The\nnext night when the policeman came round on his beat, he was told of it, and\nthey searched inside and out the house with no result. As you may easily\nimagine, the story of a ghost at the Rectory soon spread over the little village,\nand not a few believed it. I was living very near the Rectory at the time,\nand Mr. Shaw was most kind to me, so I told the confidential servant who\nwas left in charge that I would stay a night in the house and try and solve\nthe mystery ; which I did by secreting myself where I had a chance of looking\ninto the bedroom of a fresh servant that had recently been taken into the\nhouse, uid by means of a dark lantern suddenly flashed on the girl when the\nnoises commenced, I was quite satisfied that she was the author of them,\nand told Mrs. Shaw so when she returned home. The girl was started at\nonce, and the house was perfectly quiet afterwards.\nIn a later letter Mr. Gardner explains that he saw the girl\nstriking the wall with her hand, just after the old housekeeper had\npronounced her to be fast asleep. He adds that he thinks some of the\nnoises heard were probably produced by the aid of some instrument in\nher mouth.\nWe have also three cases strongly resembling in their details the Cock\nLane case, reported within the last 10 years from Cradock, South\nAustralia, East Lothian, and Perth respectively. In each case the only\nphenomena were raps. The raps occurred only when the medium\u2014 a\nlittle girl in each case \u2014was in bed, and ceased altogether when both\nthe girl's hands were under observation. In one case the medical man\nwho reported the case to us states that no rapping was ever heard\nwhen the girl's hands were kept above the bedclothes : and that a\nboard was indispensable. In another case the raps would only occur\nwhen the lights were turned out, and even under these conditions\nfailed to manifest when the girl was placed in a hammock. In the\nthird case\u2014reported to us by the Rev. Robert Nicol, of Perth\u2014a\nwitness is stated to have seen the movements of the girl's arm under\nthe bedclothes during the occurrence of raps, which appeared to proceed\nfrom a part of the wall within reach of her right hand under cover of\nthe clothes. In none of the three cases is there evidence that any\nsounds were heard which were beyond the girl's power to produce by\nordinary means.\nIt is noteworthy that in two out of the three cases, as well in the\ncase which follows, the child's parents appear to have connived at the\ntrickery.\nIn the next case our informant is General Pitt Rivers, who writes\non November 16th, 1886 ;\u2014\nRushmore, Salisbury.\nThere is absolutely nothing to investigate in the Woodcuts imposture. I\nwas asked by the man N., who has since been turned off for misconduct, to\n\f110 Frank Podmore.\ngo and investigate the rapping in his house. I have no doubt he thought it\nwould be an advertisement. Finding that all the people about were agog\nwith this ghost, I went, and Mrs. Rivers and myself, and several others,\nwent up into the room. I said, \" now let us hear some rapping,\" and the\nfather said, \" You must all go out of the room except the girl [his daughter],\nand must stand so that no one can see into the room,\" so I complied. The\ngirl asked some stupid question in the room, and immediately there were\nloud raps ; this was repeated once or twice. I then said to the girl, \" Now\nstand at the door where I can see you,\" and she did so. No raps. I then\nsaid, \" It is evident there will be no raps unless you are in the room by\nyourself out of sight.\" So I paced across the room from the door, and\nfound it six and a-half short paces, and told the girl to take three paces into\nthe room and stand there, where I knew she could touch nothing. I made\nher pace it before me to make sure that she understood. \"Now,\" I said,\n\"you must stand there and not move, and ask your questions and hear\nyour raps from that spot,\" and T then went downstairs to the bottom\nof the stairs where I was told to stand. I heard her take three paces,\nthen a very slight movement, and after that three or four loud raps.\nI stepped up the stairs two pair at a time, and found her off her post.\nMeanwhile Mrs. Rivers, instead of going downstairs with the others, had put\nherself, unknown to the girl, in the opposite room where she could see the\ngirl plainly. She saw her, after taking the three paces, look over her shoulder\ntowards the door, then run quickly, and give the three loud raps on the back\nboard of the bed. Mrs. R. then came out and told the girl what she had seen.\nShe immediately burst into tears, put her apron over her face and said,\ncrying, \"I only knocked to see if he was coming.\" I then knocked on the\nbed myself, where she had knocked, and found it made exactly the same\nnoise that we had heard downstairs. I have told the police that if anything\nwas done to make it an indictable offence, Mrs. R. and myself would give\nevidence, but the man is careful, charges nothing, and only receives gifts to\nthe extent of three and four shillings a day from sympathising idiots.\nA. Pitt Rivers.\nReverting now to the 11 cases investigated by representatives of\nthe Society, we may note that there is a general resemblance through\nout. These cases, pretty obviously, belong to the same class ; and it is\nprimd facie probable that an explanation which fits one case will fit\nall. An exception should perhaps be made in case IX., since it seems\ndoubtful whether any one was deceived by the manifestations in this\ncase except the lady of the house. But in the other cases most of those\nwho witnessed the disturbances, whether inmates of the house or\nneighbours, appear to have regarded them as inexplicable.\nNow the only explanation for which we have valid evidence at all\nis trickery. Trickery was actually detected by one or more witnesses\nin four cases (II., IV., V., VIII.). In two of these cases (II. and\nIV.) and in case IX., there was a confession of trickery. There\nis, therefore, strong ground for believing in trickery as the true and\n\fPoltergeists. Ill\nsufficient explanation in all these 11 cases. In the first place we\nmay note that the phenomena described in the Wem and Ham cases\nfor instance (II. and VIII.) were primd facie as inexplicable as\nthose testified to in other instances. But in these two cases we\nknow that trickery was employed. It is to be noted also that in\nthe Wem case the child was so skilful that though she was under the\nclose observation of several pairs of eyes in Dr. Corke's house, and\nthough she brought off many \" phenomena,\" it was not until the fifth\nday that she was actually detected in her performances, and then only\nthrough a surreptitious entry on the theatre. In the Ham case Mr.\nWestlake was able to detect the actual movements of the child only\nwhen the repetition of the performance taught him what to look for, and\nMr. Bennett, despite his strong suspicions, failed altogether to obtain\nconclusive proof of fraud. And if we remember how many and how\ngreat were the errors in observation demonstrated by Dr. Hodgson in\nthe records given by educated persons of stances with Mr. Davey, we\nshall find it not unreasonable to infer, even when direct evidence is\nwanting, like errors in the testimony, mostly of uneducated persons,\nnow under consideration. We have some indirect proof of the justice\nof this inference. It will be noted that in cases such as VI., IX.,\nX. and XI., where the witnesses were for the most part educated\npersons, and the record in some instances almost contemporaneous\nwith the event, it is not difficult to explain all that took place\u2014with\na few trifling exceptions\u2014as due to trickery. The proof of abnormal\nagency in these cases rests almost entirely on moral considerations.\nBut in cases like I., II., III., and VII., where the chief witnesses\nwere persons of limited education, the phenomena attested are of\na much more surprising kind ; and at Worksop and Durweston\nespecially, where the witnesses were not only imperfectly educated,\nbut did not give their testimony until some weeks after the event,\nthe things described seem wholly inexplicable by normal agencies.\n[Contrast, for instance, Mr. Anderson's and Mr. Newman's evidence\nin the Durweston case, p. 93 and 91].\nOne other feature in these records should be noticed in this connec\ntion. Many of the witnesses described the articles as moving slowly\nthrough the air, or exhibiting some peculiarity of flight. (See my\nreport on the Worksop case, also case VII.). Similar peculiarities are\nnoted by Mr. Bristow {Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VII., pp. 383-394).\nIn describing the movement of pieces of wood in a carpenter's shop,\nhe writes of them as now moving in a straight line and striking a door\n\" noiselessly as a feather,\" and again \" as though borne along on\ngently heaving waves.\" In a case which was investigated by one of\nour corresponding members, Herr Hans Natge, an account of which\nwas published in Berlin in 1889, under the title Der Spuk von Resau,\n\f112 Frank Podmore.\na similar phenomenon is described by the witnesses. Thus a frying part\nin the air is described as having the appearance not of a thing thrown,\nbut of a thing flying ; and the witnesses are said to have noticed the\nabsence of any curve of projection in the articles. In default of any\nsufficient evidence that the disturbances in question were due to-\nabnormal agency, I am disposed to explain the appearance of moving\nslowly or flying as a sensory illusion, conditioned by the excited state\nof the percipients.\nBut if the assumption of errors of observation of various kinds in\nthese records is necessarily supported by little direct evidence, we have\nproofs of serious errors of memory. Thus, in several instances we find\nthat the various witnesses to a phenomenon differed amongst themselves\nas to the position, or even the presence or absence of particular persons\nor failed to mention at all the whereabouts of the presumed agent ; or\nimagined that they had been present at manifestations of which\u2014\naccording to other witnesses\u2014they knew only by hearsay. (See for\ninstance the discussion on cases I., III., VI., XI.). There is an\naccount contributed to our records by the Rev. H. H. Jeaffreson of\nmovements of small objects, which may perhaps be accounted for by\noccasional lapses of memory of a rather unusual kind.\nMr. Jeaffreson writes on May 27th, 1883 :\u2014\nI do not know when we first began to notice anything strange about the\nhouse, but after no very long time we began to miss little things of no value\n(and therefore not likely to have been stolen), which mostly, though not\ninvariably, were found in places where a few minutes before we had searched\nfor them. This took place in every part of the house, but chiefly in my\nstudy. There I had a small round table (perhaps 30in. in diameter), which\nwas seldom used for anything but a cup of coffee, or a few books when I was\nsorting them for the shelves. For the most part this table was clear, and\ntherefore there was no chance of small articles being covered up accidentally,\nand as accidentally discovered. I do not think that things disappeared more\nfrom this table than any other ; but the circumstances I have mentioned\nmade the occurrence more conspicuous in the case of this table and less open\nto accident.\nIf I put down, say, a bunch of keys on this table, they frequently\ndisappeared. At first I used to search for them in vain, and come back to-\nfind them where I thought I had placed them, on the little table. At last,\nwhen we missed anything from the place where we thought we had placed it,\nwe (my wife and I) used to sit still, and after a time, the things would usually\nreappear. We never saw any article coming or going. The length of time\nvaried. Perhaps the longest interval was in the case of a bracelet, which\ndisappeared one night as my wife was dressing for a party, and reappeared\nabout the same time the next night lying in the middle of a doorway through\nwhich we had passed many times, and in which I had carefully searched with\na candle the first night, and the servants the next morning.\n\fPoltergeists. 113\nMr. Jeaffreson adds, \" similar removals have in our opinion taken\nplace since we left H. in the houses we have since occupied, but less\nfrequently and less conspicuously.\"\nOf the errors of narration perpetrated by journalists in search of\nsensational copy (see cases II. and V.), it is hardly necessary to\nspeak, except to point out that the dramatic and exaggerated accounts\nof the disturbances given in the newspapers inevitably react upon the\nmemories of those who read them, and so tend still further to vitiate\ntestimony.\nBut it is much easier to infer that trickery has been practised in\nthese cases than to find a plausible motive for trickery. In one or two\ninstances, indeed, intelligible motives have been suggested for the\nfraud. (See, for instance, cases V. and XI., and the account given\nby General Pitt Rivers on p. 109). But in most cases it is difficult to\nconceive that any adequate or even rational end was aimed at by the\nauthors of the disturbance. A considerable amount of labour,\n\u2022extending in some cases over months or years, has been voluntarily\nundertaken by the agent ; much annoyance, expense, and occasionally\nsevere distress has been inflicted on other persons; and a lively sensation\nhas been caused in the neighbourhood. But there has been apparently\nno revenge to satisfy, and such fame as lies in the mouths of rustics,\nand in occasional paragraphs in provincial newspapers, would hardly\nconstitute for normal persons\u2014even for children\u2014a sufficient recom\npense for the labour incurred. And yet it is, in fact, in the desire to\ncause a sensation that the working motive is probably to be found.\nThe reader must have been struck by the fact that the agent\u2014or\ncentral figure\u2014in the great majority of the cases quoted is a young\ngirl, roughly between the ages of 12 and 16, though one or two may\nhave been a little older. The agent in each of the six cases last cited\nwas a young girl ; and in the 1 1 cases given at length, a young girl\nappears in eight cases and a young boy in three (in one of which\n\u2014 case IV.\u2014 he is apparently associated with his young sister). But\na further peculiarity is to be noted beside the youth of the agents, to\nwit, their mental and physical abnormality. In the Worksop case,\nthe presumed agent was a half-witted girl, child of an imbecile mother.\nIn the Wem case, Emma Davies was stated by her mother to be\nsubject to fits. In the Bramford case, the girl appears to have suffered\nfrom attacks of hysterical blindness. In cases VI. and VIII., the girl\nwas deformed, in case VII. hysterical and consumptive. In case IX.\nthe boy was delicate and liable to attacks of spontaneous somnam\nbulism ; and in case X. the girl is delicate and has outgrown her\nstrength. Thus in eight out of the 11 cases we have evidence of\nill-health or abnormality more or less pronounced. This evidence is\nstrengthened if we accept the agent's own testimony for the occurrence\ni\n\f114 Frank Podmore.\nof hallucinations. Thus, in cases II., III., IV., VI., VII. and X., the\nagent was the subject of hallucinations, which in case VI. were frequent\nand prolonged.\nIt may be suggested then that, in the majority of these cases, the\nreal motive which impelled these children to a long series of apparently\nmeaningless acts of mischief, was the excessive love of notoriety which\nis occasionally associated with other morbid conditions, especially in\nyoung girls. Case XI., on this view, remains unaccounted for, since\nthe agents in this instance were educated adults, apparently free from\nmorbid influences.\nTo sum up : (1) In the eleven cases which we have investigated in\ndetail, direct proofs of trickery have been obtained in several instances.\n(2) Where the phenomena have been recorded shortly after their\noccurrence by educated persons, trickery is found\u2014moral considerations\napart\u2014to be an adequate explanation. (3) Where the phenomena have\nbeen described by illiterate persons, or recorded some time after the\nevent, this explanation becomes difficult ; and the difficulty is found to,\nincrease directly with the length of the interval and inversely with the\neducation of the witness. (4) But these eleven cases are fairly\nrepresentative of their class. A certain number of such cases are\nbrought to our notice each year. These eleven cases were selected for\ninvestigation, mainly because from the accounts in the press, or from\nreports received from trustworthy private sources, they seemed to\npresent a primdJacie case for abnormal agency. It is difficult to resist\nthe conclusion that if the opportunity had been given to us, with the\nexperience which we have now obtained, to undertake an equally full\nand searching inquiry into the cases of this kind which figure so largely\nin the literature of the subject, the evidence for abnormal agency\nwould have been found as little calculated to convince. Take, for\ninstance, the movement of pieces of wood in a carpenter's shop\nalready referred to. It is one of the most striking cases ever published,\nand as described by an honest and intelligent witness, the phenomena\nseem perfectly inexplicable. But the account printed at length in the\nProceedings (Vol. VII., p. 383), was written 42 years after the events\nrecorded. It is, indeed, based on some earlier notes ; but these notes\nthemselves were not committed to writing until five years after the\nevents. That some movements of the kind described did occur in\n1849 we can well believe ; indeed we have corroboration of the fact\nfrom at least one other living witness. But the most we seem entitled\nto conclude from their reports is that Mr. Bristow and his friends did\nnot at the time discover how the movements were caused, and that\ntheir later recollections afford us no clue.\nThe case given in the same volume, pp. 160-173, is evidentially\nstronger, inasmuch as the events were recorded within a few weeks or\n\fPoltergeists. 115\ndays of their occurrence. But it will be observed in this case that\nmuch of the evidence on which the narrator relies is second-hand ; that\nwe have practically only one account of the incidents, since Mrs. K., the\nhousekeeper, merely confirms the account written by the master of the\nhouse, and does not give an independent version . that the disturbances\nwere unquestionably connected with the presence of a young and new\nservant, and ceased when she left the house temporarily ; and that this\nyoung servant became delirious towards the end of the manifestations.\nWe have only to assume \u2014what experience entitles us to assume\n\u2014slight defects of observation on the part of the witnesses, and slight\nerrors on the part of the narrator, to place the case on the level of the\neleven which we have already investigated. It is suggested that to\nestablish even a primd facie case for abnormal agency in such cases,\nwe need evidence of quite another kind from any which has yet been\nbrought forward.\nBefore the subject is dismissed, attention may be directed to two\npoints. The first is that the moral presumption, upon which the\nevidence for abnormal physical phenomena occurring in the presence\nof private persons mainly depends, is seriously weakened by this\ndemonstration of frequent, elaborate and long-continued trickery,\npractised occasionally even by educated persons, without apparent\nrecompense or adequate motive. The second point is that genuine\nhallucinations may apparently be associated with fraudulent physical\nphenomena. Leaving on one side the hallucinations alleged to have\nbeen experienced by the agents in many of these cases\u2014though these\nare not without interest\u2014we find hallucinations reported by the\nwitnesses in several instances. Thus at Ham, case IX., one witness\nis recorded to have seen a woman's face in the oven ; and in cases\nVI. and X. several credible witnesses give accounts of hallucinatory\nexperiences. Many of the auditory experiences, and at least two of\nthe visual hallucinations, appear to have been collective.\nThese facts are of special interest in their bearing on the phenomena\nof collective hallucination, and on the genesis of hallucinatory-\ndisturbances\u2014auditory and visual\u2014in so-called \" haunted houses.\"\nI 2\n\f116 Miss Alice Johnson.\nV.\nA CASE OF INFORMATION SUPERNORMALLY\nACQUIRED.\nBy Miss Alice Johnson.\nI have been asked by Professor Sidgwick to put together and\ncomment on the evidence in the case here printed, since it seems\nof sufficient interest to be worth discussing at somewhat greater\nlength than is usually, in these Proceedings, afforded to single cases.\nThe most important and instructive details have only been brought\nout, as will be seen, by prolonged and careful enquiry on the part of\nthe Russian investigators to whom we are indebted for the collection\nof the evidence. The printed selections from their correspondence will\ngive some idea of the amount of labour they have spent on the\ninvestigation. Most of the information was obtained through the\nkindness of Mr. Joseph Kronhelm, while the energy and perseverance\nof Mr. M. Petrovo-Solovovo\u2014 whose name is well-known to all\nmembers of the S.P.R.\u2014in collecting and transcribing it, has made\nthe full presentation of the case possible.\nThe main incidents are given in the following narrative,\u2014a\ntranslation of a letter from Mr. Kronhelm in the Revue Spirite for\nJuly, 1895.\nJune 10th, 1895.\n. . . The following is an account of an apparition seen by my\nengineer, Mr. Vincent Idanowicz, here at Creczelowka, District Gajsin,\nPodolia, Russia.\nOn November 10th, 1894, Mr. Idanowicz went to Gajsin to order a fur\ncloak from the tailor, Izloma Sierota. While he was looking at the material,\nSierota showed him an almost new fur cloak, and induced him to purchase\nit at the price of forty-five roubles, saying that he had bought it from a\nMr. Lassota. Mr. Idanowicz agreed to take the cloak. . . . He returned\nhome pleased with his bargain, went to bed and slept profoundly. (Mr.\nIdanowicz and his brother Ivan occupy a room on my premises.) After\nmidnight he was awakened by a gentleman dressed in black. He was not\nalarmed in any way, but considerably surprised to see a man whom he did\nnot know and had never seen before, knowing, besides, that the room\ndoor was locked, and he asked, \" Who are you, sir, and what do you want ? \"\nThe apparition replied, \"lam called Wiszniecoski, and I come to advise\nyou to return, as quickly as possible, this fur which you have just bought\nfrom Izloma Sierota for forty-five roubles, since it did not belong to Mr.\nLassota, but to a judge at Gajsin, who has just died of phthisis. The fur is\n\fA Case of Information Supernormally Acquired. 117\ninfected by phthisic bacilli.\" Thereupon the vision disappeared, and Mr.\nIdanowicz got up in order to see how Mr. Wiszniecoski could have got out,\nas the only entrance to the room was double-locked as usual. Understanding\nnothing of what he had seen and believing it to be a hallucination \u2014all the\nmore because his brother, who had awakened after the apparition had\nvanished and had heard and seen nothing, laughed at him\u2014Mr. Idanowicz\nwent to bed again and next day resumed his ordinary work, without saying\na word to any one about what he had seen and heard. On the following\nnight, the two brothers retired to bed as usual, but, as they could not\nsleep, they talked over their affairs, and chiefly about Mr. Vincent's fiancee\nand her family. Suddenly they heard steps approaching their chamber, and\nthe door, which was locked, opened smartly. Greatly astonished, they saw\na gentleman in black enter, who said to them, ' ' You are both awake. Well,\nthis time, Mr. Vincent, you will not say that my appearance yesterday was\na hallucination. I come, therefore, to repeat to you : Go and ask Mr.\nKronhelm to allow you to go to Gajsin to-morrow, and return the fur to\nIzloma Sierota, who is deceiving you in saying that it belonged to Mr.\nLassota. I repeat that it belonged to a judge, who died of phthisis at\nGajsin. It is infected with phthisic bacilli. I was a Government official at\nLipowice (in the Kieff district), and died there in 1892 ; but as my mission\nis to watch over you, I warn you of what will happen if you do not follow\nmy advice.\" So saying, the apparition vanished.\nAt five o'clock the same morning I was awakened by my valet, who\nsaid that the Idanowiczes insisted on seeing me, having an urgent affair to\ncommunicate ; I got up and saw the two brothers, pale and frightened, and\nthey told me the story of the apparition. Being myself a convinced\nSpiritualist, ... I decided to go with Mr. Vincent Idanowicz to\nGajsin, in order to examine into the assertions made by the \"guardian\nangel,\" as Mr. Idanowicz justly calls him.\nThe Jew Sierota denied it flatly and maintained that what he had said\nabout buying the cloak from Mr. Lassota was strictly accurate. I then\ncalled on the judge at Gajsin, who confirmed the statement that his\npredecessor had died of phthisis, but knew nothing about his effects, which\nhad probably been taken possession of by his heirs. Finally, he advised me\nto consult the second-hand dealer, Boruch Fonkonogi ; the latter told me\nthat he had bought all the effects of the late judge, except a fur cloak, which\nhad been bought by Izloma Sierota. We showed him the fur cloak and he\nrecognised it at once and said that he was ready to swear to the truth of\nwhat he affirmed.\n. .**\u2022\u2022\nJoseph de Kronhelm.\nMr. Solovovo wrote to Mr. Kronhelm, asking him for further\nparticulars of the case, and forwarded to Professor Sidgwick the reply\nreceived, with his own translation of it, part of which is here printed.\nTchetcheliovka, August 3rd\/15th, 1895.\nSir,\u2014Much to my regret it is but with one half of your request that I\nam able to comply. I have not got all the proofs you are asking for of the\nreality of the apparition of the late Wischnevsky's ghost to Mr. Zdanovitch ;\n\f118 Miss Alice Johnson.\nas for making inquiries, it would be for me a great inconvenience, owing\nto the absence of the persons required. I am able to give a satisfactory\nreply only to the first point of your letter, as I append to this letter Mr.\nZdanovitch's attestation of the truth of the fact he had communicated to me,\nviz., as to his having bought of Sirota a fur cloak, and as to the ghost of the\ndeceased Wischnevsky having appeared to him twice ; also a statement by\nZdanovitch's brother that he really saw one night a man who appeared\nto him through a closed door and called himself Wischnevsky. .\n\u2014I am, etc., j Kronhelm.\nThe statements enclosed by Mr. Kronhelm were also forwarded to\nProfessor Sidgwick. Mr. Solovovo translates them as follows :\u2014\u25a0\nAttestation.\nTchetcheliovka, August M\/16th, 1895.\nThe fact of my having bought of the Jew Schlioma Sirota a fur cloak and\nof the ghost of the deceased Wischnevsky having appeared to me twice in\norder to warn me against the danger of catching consumption is absolutely\ntrue. I certify its truth with my signature.\nVincent Osipovitch Zdanovitch.\nStatement.\nTchetcheliovka, August Uh\/lGth, 1895.\nWhen spending the night in the same room with my brother Vincent\nZdanovitch on the 12th\/24th of November, 1894, I really saw, at 11 p.m., a\nman come in, dressed in black, who called himself Wischnevsky, and talked\nto my brother about his giving away the fur cloak he had bought of Sirota.\nThe door was locked, so that it was impossible for a living man to come into\nthe room without unlocking the door. I append my signature.\nIvan Osipovitch Zdanovitch.\nN.B. \u2014 The names \"Tchetcheliovka\" and \"Zdanovitch\" may also be\nwritten \" Czeczelowka \" and \"Zdanowicz\" if we adopt the Polish\northography. M p g\nMr. Kronhelm in the letter above quoted had confused \" Wisch\nnevsky \" with the deceased owner of the fur cloak, although in his\noriginal narrative it -seemed clear that they were two distinct persons,\nand a good deal of correspondence took place before this mistake was\ncleared up. In a letter written on November 17th\/29th, 1895, Mr.\nSolovovo informed us that Mr. Zdanovitch's attestation applied to the\nnarrative given in the Revue Spirite, in which, as he remarked, though\nit was not expressly stated, it was certainly implied that Mr.\nZdanovitch was not acquainted either with Wischnevsky or the\ndeceased judge. Mr. Solovovo had meanwhile written to Lipovetz\n(the town where Wischnevsky was stated to have died\u2014spelt\n'. Lipowice \" in the Revue Spirite) to make enquiries, but had received\n\fA Case of Information SwpernormaUy Acquired. 119\na reply that no Government official of that name had died there at the\ndate mentioned. He then wrote again to Mr. Kronhelm and his next\nletter contains further information.\nDecember 2dth\/January 7th [1896].\nDear Mr. Sidgwick,\u2014It gives me much pleasure to be at last able to send\nyou a good deal of additional evidence concerning the Wischnevsky case. I\nreceived Mr. Kronhelm's letter on December 21st (January 2nd), but owing\nto an attack of influenza, was unable to translate its contents at once.\nL You will perceive on reading Mr. Kronhelm's letter that one\nparticularly puzzling point in the whole story has at last been cleared up.\nWe now know that Wischnevsky and the proprietor of the fur cloak or\novercoat were not one and the same person ; Mr. K. states this most\ncategorically. I suppose in his former letter to me he had merely mixed up\ntwo similar names, \u2014Wischnevsky and Nevsky. At any rate there is no\nsuch confusion in the printed narrative.\n2. The name of the locality where W. died, stated to be \" Lipowice \"\nin the Bevue Spirite, appears to be now \" Ilyintzy \" or \" Lintzy \" (the\nlatter being the popular form) ; this [is] in accordance with Mr. Kronhelm's\nfirst letter to me. The Bevue Spirite article is full of such extraordinary\nmisprints that we may well suppose \" Lipowice \" to have been one of them.\nMoreover, almost every name cited admits of at least two ways of being\nwritten.1 Thus Mr. Kronhelm spells the name of his estate, \" Czeczelowka,\"\nwhilst I have adopted for it the form \" Tchetcheliovka,\" which is more\ncorrect so far as pronunciation is concerned. Besides, as it now appears,\nMr. Kronhelm has never had much information about Wischnevsky, and\nMr. Zdanovitch (alias Zdanowicz or Sdanowitsch) none at all before the\napparition ; both may therefore have confounded the little-known name\n\" Lintzy \" with the much better known \"Lipowice\" or \" Lipovetz \" in the\nsame province (Kieff).\nI therefore think that we need not trouble ourselves about these two\npoints. And as you asked me last time my opinion of Mr. Kronhelm, I may\nsay now that\u2014so far as one may judge him by his letters\u2014he must be a\nthoroughly trustworthy (morally) and painstaking gentleman. His good\nfaith is for me above doubt.\nWith regard to the examining magistrate's mortal illness, it is certainly\nunfortunate that phthisis is not mentioned as the cause of his death in the\nofficial document. But I think we may safely rely on the priest's evidence.\nLast of all, if you think it necessary to have some official document about\nWischnevsky's death, I shall try to get it ; but in that case directly, not\nthrough Mr. Kronhelm. I am afraid, however, it will be difficult, as we\nknow so little about him.\nExtract from Mr. Kronhelm's Utter to me (received on December 21st\/\nJanuary 2nd, \"95\/'96).-M. P.

Nevsky, though called a \"judge\" iu the Revue Spirite,\nwas no judge, but an examining magistrate. He lived in the town of\nGaysin, where he died of phthisis.

I enclose, however, with this an extract from these church\nregisters with the Very Rev. Mikhnevitch's signature.\nI enclose with this Boruch Tonkonogy's original attestation as to the fur\ncloak having belonged to Nevsky.\nMessrs. Zdanovitch themselves knew positively nothing about Wisch-\nnevsky. The statements made by the ghost were also unknown to them.\nIt is true that a certain Wischnevsky had been known to Mr. Domansky, my\nsteward, who has become related to Mr. Zdanovitch (Z. married D.'s sister\nlast year). As for myself, the information I have about Wischnevsky is very\nscanty.

He writes :\u2014\nJanuary 6th\/18th, 1896.\nDear Mr. Sidgwick,\u2014I wrote about a week ago to the police authorities\nat Lipovetz, Kieff, asking for information about Wischnevsky's death, and\nwill probably get a reply before long.\nI have ascertained that Ilintzy, where W. is said to have died, is situated\nvery near the town of Lipovetz\u2014something like twelve English miles, I\nthink ; so that there is no discrepancy on this point between the printed\nnarrative and Mr. Kronhelm's present statements.\nM. Petrovo-Solovovo.\nSt. Petersburg, January 21th\/February Mh [1896].\nDear Mr. Sidgwick,\u2014It is only to-day that I am in receipt of an\nofficial reply from the police authorities of Lipovetz, Government of Kieff,\nstating that a certain N. F. Wischnevsky, a private solicitor, is living at\npresent at Ilintzy, district of Lipovetz, and that there has been at Ilintzy no\nother person of the same name.\nI shall write to this Mr. Wischnevsky, stating the case in full, etc. , and\nwill also inform Mr. Kronhelm of this strange discovery. I doubt, however,\nwhether Mr. Wischnevsky will be able to clear up the matter.\nIf you can suggest anything else, I shall comply at once with your\nadvice.\nM. Petrovo-Solovovo.\nThe next letters give the results of Mr. Solovovo's correspondence\nwith Mr. Wischnevsky, and some further remarks by Mr. Kronhelm.\n38, Sergievskaia, St. Petersburg, February ith\/16th [1896].\nDear Mr. Sidgwick,\u2014I have received to-day an answer from Mr.\nWischnevsky (whom we had supposed to be dead !) : and I am sorry to say\nthat his letter cannot throw any light on the subject of our inquiry.\nHe says that he has lived for 25 years at Ilintzy ; and that during this\ninterval two persons of the name of Wischnevsky1 did live there too ; but\none of them left Ilintzy 20 years ago, and the other lives at present at\nWinnitza, Podolia. He also says there certainly was no Wischnevsky at\nLipovetz in 1892.\nHe is not acquainted either with Mr. Kronhelm or with Mr. Zdanovitch.\nHe met a Mr. Domansky thirty years ago, but it was not at Zaslav, since he\n1 Not a very uncommon name in general.\u2014M.P.S.\n\f122 Miss Alice Johnson.\nhas not been there since 1853 ; and he lived then at Jitomiz. As you see, the\nidentity of this Domansky with Mr. Zdanovitch's brother-in-law is doubtful.\nHe has never heard the story before, etc.\nI will write again as soon as I receive a reply from Mr. Kronhelm. In\nmy opinion, however, the absence of any positive information about the\nWischnevsky of Mr. Kronhelm's narrative does not invalidate the case.\nM. Petrovo-Solovovo.\nSt. Petersburg, March 9th\/21st [1896].\nDear Mr. Sidgwick,\u2014I have at last received a reply from Mr.\nKronhelm, who now lives at Kieff, which explains why he did not reply to\nme before. He says, '' I have several times written to Lipovetz, but have\nnot learned anything ; as I lived far from Lipovetz, I did not go there\nmyself in order to find out the above-mentioned Wischnevsky, but only\nlearnt certain details from a former inhabitant of Lipovetz, M. A. A.\nDomansky [which details we possess already]. ... I did all I could to\nfind out the truth.\"\nMr. Kronhelm further says there is nothing extraordinary in the fact\nthat there lives now at Lintzy a Mr. Wischnevsky, seeing that the name is\nvery common in the south of Russia, and is borne both by Catholics and\nby members of the Orthodox Church. He will ascertain, he says, to what\nCatholic parish Lipovetz belongs, and will then ask a Catholic priest to clear\nup the matter. Mr. Vincent Zdanovitch and his brother are no more in\nMr. Kronhelm's service, having left him at Christmas. He has given V. Z.\na certificate of good behaviour, but has not heard from him and his brother\nBince.\nM. Petrovo-Solovovo.\nPerhaps the most remarkable feature in this curious case is the\nmixture of truth and probable falsehood in the information given by\nthe apparition. The percipient is instructed on two quite distinct\nsubjects:\u2014(1) the history of the cloak,\u2014afterwards fully verified;\nand (2) the supposed history of the phantasmal \" Wischnevsky,\"\nwho, according to the evidence in our possession, is most probably a\npurely fictitious personage.\nWith regard to the first subject,\u2014the history of the cloak,\u2014three\npossible sources of the information may be suggested. First, it may\nhave come from the deceased owner of the cloak. This hypothesis\ndoes not seem to have occurred to any of the persons concerned, and\nindeed has little to recommend it. If it was the magistrate Nevsky\nwho was communicating, why did he give a wrong name and address 1\nHis words would have carried greater weight if he had announced\nhimself frankly as the owner of the cloak.\nThe second hypothesis is that the information was obtained\nthrough some kind of clairvoyance on the part of Mr. Zdanovitch.\nIt may have been telepathic clairvoyance, the agent being the Jew\ndealer, whose guilty conscience\u2014shown apparently by his telling a\n\fA Case of Information Supernormally Acquired. 123\nfalsehood about the cloak\u2014may have been the exciting cause of the\ntelepathic impact. Two cases of veridical, possibly telepathic, im\npressions with regard to criminal actions of a more serious kind are\ngiven by Mrs. McCall Black in the Journal. S.P.R., Vol. V., pp. 270\nand 272. In the first, Mrs. Black, discovering her purse stolen, had\nan impression that it had been taken by a certain person, whom she\nhad no reason for suspecting, and that it was then in a certain place.\nImmediate search was made and the purse found. On another\noccasion, after a burglary in her house, she dreamt that two persons\nwere concerned in it, one known to her and the other not, and direc\ntions were given how to treat each of them. She was told the name and\naddress of the unknown thief in her dream, and she wrote to him next\nday and finally recovered all her property. In another case given in\nMr. Myers' paper on The Subliminal Self in the Proceedings S.P.R.,\nVol. XI., Part XXIX., p. 459, Dr. D. J. Parsons, going to his oflice\nwith his nephew to consult a book, was prevented by a sudden and\nunaccountable impulse from going in himself. His nephew went in\nalone and was shot at, but not injured, by a man who was hiding near\nby with the intention of murdering Dr. Parsons.\nThe third hypothesis is that the facts given were subconsciously\nknown to Mr. Zdanovitch beforehand. It must be remembered that\nhe lived near the town of Gaysin, to which the deceased magistrate\nbelonged, and may have been in the habit of going there frequently.\nNevsky, being probably a somewhat important personage in the town,\nmay have been pointed out to him once or twice, and may then have\nbeen wearing the cloak. He may easily have forgotten this encounter;\nbut if it ever took place, he might then have noticed some mark on\nthe cloak by which he afterwards subconsciously recognized it.\nSomething in the Jew's manner, again, may have led him to suspect\nsome nefarious dealing. Possibly the subliminal self of the average\nhalf-educated Russian lives in a chronic state of suspicion of the\naverage Jew.\nWe have abundant evidence of the superior acuteness of the\nsubliminal to the supraliminal self, both in making observations and in\ndrawing conclusions from them, and though this does not explain why the\nconclusions should be presented in an elaborate dramatic form rather\nthan in a plain straightforward manner, there are numerous instances\nin which it actually is so,\u2014e.g. the well-known case of \"Miss X.\"'s\nrecalling the forgotten date of Ptolemy Philadelphus by means of a\ncrystal-vision of a Jewish Elder at work on the Septuagint\n(Proceedings, Vol. V., p. 512), and Professor Hilprecht's dream of the\nAssyrian inscription, given above in Professor Newbold's paper (see\nante, p. 14). At the same time, it must be observed that while all\nthe facts given in Professor Hilprecht's dream could have been deduced\n\f124 Miss Alice Johnson.\nfrom information already in his possession,\u2014although some of it had\nbeen, as was proved, once known to him and subsequently forgotten,\u2014\nthere is no proof that any of the facts about the cloak had ever been\nknown to Mr. Zdanovitch, or could have been deduced from anything\nwithin his knowledge. The case merely shares in the weakness inherent\nin all cases of apparently supernormal knowledge of past events,\u2014the\ndifficulty, namely, of completely excluding the explanation suggested.\nEven' if this be the true explanation, however, it does not, of course,\naccount for the apparition having been seen by both the brothers\ncollectively ; but this point will be dealt with later.\nWe have next to consider the significance of the personality\n\"Wischnevsky.\" Mr. Zdanovitch may possibly have heard through his\nfuture brother-in-law, Mr. Domansky, of the Mr. Wischnevsky1 whom\nthe latter had met at Zaslav. The town of Gaysin, near which they\nlived, is about 34 (English) miles from Lipovetz, near which Wischnevsky\nis said to have lived. Zaslav is about 120 miles from Lipovetz, and\nthe Mr. Wischnevsky whom Mr. Domansky met there told him that he\nwas a government official at Ilyintzy (or, Lintzy) about 12 miles from\nLipovetz. They appear to have been merely casual acquaintances. It\nis assumed at first that the apparition represents this Wischnevsky,\nand that he died, as stated, in 1892. One would naturally suppose that\na spirit so well acquainted with the affairs of the Gaysin magistrate\nwould have at least an equally accurate knowledge of his own name and\nformer occupation, and the place and date of his death. However, the\npolice authorities at Lipovetz, who must no doubt know of all the\ngovernment officials in the neighbourhood, state that the only person\nof this name recently inhabiting Uintzy is still living there, and\nthere is no ground for connecting this living Wischnevsky with the\napparition, while his identity with the Wischnevsky formerly known\nto Mr. Domansky is very doubtful.\nWe are told, moreover, that Wischnevsky is a very common name\nin the south of Russia ; but, since all the facts given about the\nphantasmal Wischnevsky are entirely unsupported by the evidence, the\n1 Mrs. Verrall writes to me with regard to this case :\u2014\n\"5, Selwyn Gardens, Cambridge, May lith, [1896],\n\"One small point occurs to me as favouring your 'third hypothesis,' viz., that\nthe facts were known subconsciously to the percipient. It is the undoubtedly curious\nresemblance in sound between the names of the apparition and the deceased owner.\nHad the apparition been what he described himself, I suppose we should have\nregarded the resemblance as merely 'odd,' but under the circumstances, ... it\nseems to me that if Mr. Vincent Z. did, as you suggest, know subconsciously the\nfacts about Nevsky, and had heard the name Wischnevsky, it is exceedingly likely\nthat his subliminal self would give one name while announcing the facts known to the\nother person. At least this is the way, as we all know from personal experience, in\nwhich a half-remembered fact connects itself with similar facts or words.\"\n\fA Case of Information Supernormally Acquired. 125\ncommonness of the name only reduces still further any force that there\nmight have been in the \" identity test.\" Wischnevsky, in fact, plays\nin the story the part of a hallucinatory \"Mrs. Harris,\" and we are led\nseriously to doubt whether there is any such person.\nIf we now compare this case with the ordinary experiences of\nmediums, we find that it almost always appears to them that their\n\"communications\" come from some definite personal source or sources,\nand it often seems purely accidental whether the person conceived of\nas the source is a real or an imaginary person. There is, so far as I\nam aware, no objective evidence whatever of the real existence of\n\" Phinuit,\" or of the less well-known \" Elvira,\" described in Dr.\nErmacora's paper in the Proceedings S.P.R., Part XXVIII. (Vol.\nXI.), p. 235. On the other hand, the utterances given in Mrs. Piper's\ntrance constantly refer themselves to definite individuals, while her\n\" controls \" other than Phinuit are occasionally recognised by her\nsitters as real persons known to them. The case here under discussion\nseems transitional between these cases and the hallucinations of the\nordinary non-mediumistic person, which are generally of a much less\ncomplicated type, affecting one sense only at a time.\nEvery one, however, is accustomed to meeting with the more\ncomplicated and dramatic element in his dream-conceptions, and\nProfessor Hilprecht's dream, already referred to, of the Assyrian priest\nwho explained to him how to decipher the inscription, is a noteworthy\ncase in point. The conception of the priest arises naturally,\u2014one\nmight almost say, inevitably\u2014out of the circumstances of the dream.\nBut while we can see the probable causes at work in his construction,\nWischnevsky seems a purely fancy sketch.\nHis being represented as a deceased person is another point of\nresemblance to the mediumistic type. For in accordance with their\npreconceived ideas, mediums constantly regard their \"communications\"\nas coming from such spirits, and the element sometimes obtrudes itself\ninto the midst of a partially veridical communication. Two instances of\nthis are given in Mr. Myers' paper on \" The Subliminal Consciousness:\nMotor Automatism,\" in the Proceedings S.P.R.,Vol. IX., pp. 65 and 67.\nIn the first, the medium gives some correct information about an early\nfriend of the sitter's, but states incorrectly that he is dead at the time.\nIn the second, after some rather striking statements about the sitter's\ndeceased father, the medium gives the name, and date and cause of\ndeath\u2014by accident\u2014of a former pupil of his, the name of the clergy\nman who preached the funeral sermon, and the text from which he\npreached. The names were those of real persons known to the sitter,\nand the accident was one which he had feared might take place, but it\nhad never actually occurred. Later on in the same paper, among the\nexperiences of \" Miss A.,\" is given the curious case of \" John Black \"\n\f126 Miss Alice Johnson.\n(loc. cit., p. 84), who on his first appearance announces himself as dead,\nbut is found afterwards to be alive.\nThere remains one more remarkable feature in the case, viz., that\nthe apparition was seen and heard by Mr. Zdanovitch's brother as well\nas by himself. The impressions of Mr. Ivan Zdanovitch, however,\ncannot be considered independent of those of his brother. It was only\nafter hearing of his brother's experience of the preceding night that he\nhimself saw the apparition. If he was sufficiently impressionable to\nexperience anything, it would be likely to take the form already\nsuggested to him, and accordingly the second experience is hardly\nmore than a mere repetition of the first. The only additional points\nare the statements relating to the former occupation and death of\nWischnevsky, and these are just the details which investigation has\nshown to be probably erroneous.\nThe significance of collective hallucinations is discussed in the\n\" Report on the Census of Hallucinations,\" in the Proceedings S.P.R.,\nVol. X., pp. 319-326, where it is maintained that hallucinations,\u2014\nwhether veridical or falsidical,\u2014may be transmitted from one person\nto another by verbal or telepathic suggestion, or by both kinds of\nsuggestion acting together, and that it is generally unnecessary to\nassume any agency external to the minds of the two percipients.\nThis theory explains the cases where the hallucination represents\nsome inanimate object or animal, and brings collective hallucinations\nunder the same category as \" simultaneous dreams,\" such as those\ngiven in Phantasm,!! of the Living, Vol. I., pp. 314 to 316, or that\nnarrated by Miss Bidder (see Journal S.P.R., Vol. IV, p. 344), in\nwhich she and her sister dreamt at the same time of a pre-historic\nhuman skeleton with a long snout.\nAs the conception of telepathy was deduced from a large number\nof experiments, in the great majority of which the ideas transferred\nwere trivial in the extreme, so these trivial spontaneous cases may\ngive us the clue to the true explanation of cases whose psychological\nsignificance is apt to be obscured by emotional considerations. For\nany one who admits the possibility of telepathy, it would be not only\nunnecessary but absurd, to maintain that these dreams of the Mis*\nBidders were caused by an external agent ; and it seems to me equally\nunnecessary\u2014though not, of course, equally absurd\u2014to assume an\nexternal agent in the present case. We know that verbal suggestion\nmay occasionally produce hallucinations and there was undoubtedly\nverbal suggestion here, while this may have been supplemented at\nthe moment by telepathic suggestion from one percipient to the\nother.\n\fSupplement.] James Braid ; his Work and Writings. 127\nSUPPLEMENT.\nJAMES BRAID ; HIS WORK AND WRITINGS.\nBy Dr. J.

(1) He was an English surgeon. (2) He\nbelieved in phrenology. (3) He was the discoverer or rediscoverer of the\nsubjective origin of hypnotic phenomena. (4) He knew nothing of\nsuggestion. In all this, one thing, and one alone, is correct, namely, that\nBraid was the rediscoverer of the subjective nature of hypnotic phenomena.\nThis estimate of Braid has arisen from imperfect knowledge of his writings.\nFew seem to be acquainted with any of his works except \" Neurypnology,''\nor with the fact that this was only one of a long series on the subject of\nhypnotism, and that in the later ones his views completely changed. The\nnecessarily limited length of this article will prevent my dealing with each\nof these separately and in detail. I propose, therefore, first to refer shortly\nto his earliest publication, then to give an account of the theories which are\nfound in \" Neurypnology \" alone, and finally to present a general picture of\nhis later opinions.\nMeanwhile, a word as to Braid's nationality and to the events which led\nto his hypnotic researches. The names of Elliotson, Esdaile and Braid\nstand out prominently in the history of mesmerism and hypnotism in this\ncountry, and it is not without interest to note that all of them studied at\nEdinburgh University, and that both Esdaile and Braid were of Scotch birth\nand parentage, the latter being born at Rylaw House, Fifeshire, about\n1795.\nOn November 13th, 1841, Braid, for the first time, was present at a\nmesmeric seance, the operator being Lafontaine. At this time mesmeric\nphenomena were believed to be due either to mysterious force or fluid, self-\ndeception or trickery. Braid held the latter theory and, on the first\noccasion, saw nothing to cause him to alter his views. At the next seance,\nsix days later, he noticed that one subject was unable to open his eyes.\nBraid regarded this as a real phenomenon and was anxious to discover its\nphysiological cause ; and the following evening, when the case was again\noperated on, he believed he had done so. After making a series of experiments,\nchiefly on personal friends and relatives, he expressed his conviction that\nthe phenomena he had witnessed were purely subjective, and began almost\nimmediately to place these views before the public, his first lecture being\ndelivered on December 27th, 1841.\nIn 1842, Braid offered a paper on the subject of hypnotism to the\nMedical Section of the British Association. This was refused, whereupon he\ngave a conversazione at which many members of the Association were\npresent, read his paper and showed cases. His first work on mesmerism was\nentitled \" Satanic Agency and Mesmerism reviewed, in a letter to the Rev.\nH. McNeile, A.M., of Liverpool, in Reply to a Sermon preached by hiin at\nSt. Jude's Church, Liverpool, on Sunday, April 10th, 1842.\" McNeile\nhad charged Braid with \"refusing to state the laws of nature by the uniform\nK\n\f130 [Supplement.\nBr. J. Milne Bramwell.\naction of which mesmeric phenomena were produced.\" To this Braid replied\nthat he had always explained the phenomena on physiological and psycho\nlogical principles, but that McNeile had refused to attend his lectures or to\nread any account of them. Braid at this time believed in the physical origin\nof hypnotic phenomena, and referred to the theory by which he attempted\nto explain certain changes in the central nervous system, more particularly\ndecreased functional activity, as the result of the exhaustion of other nerve\ncentres from continued monotonous stimulation. \"But,\" he said, \"even\nsupposing my theories did not explain the whole of the phenomena, surely,\nwhen beneficial application could be made of the extent of the knowledge\nwe had acquired, we ought to be at liberty to do so without being stigmatised\nfrom the pulpit as necromancers, or producing our effects by 'Satanic\nagency.' Supposing a hundred passengers start in one of your packets, and\n20 or 30 of them become sea-sick, and the others escape, would it be fair to\nimplicate the captain in a charge of acting by Satanic agency because the\nwhole were not sick, and because, according to McNeile, ' if it be in nature,\nit will operate uniformly and not capriciously ? . . . If it operate\ncapriciously, then there is some mischievous agent at work ; and we are not\nignorant of the devices of the devil.' Would any man but Mr. McNeile\nsay that, because the captain gave the signal to heave anchor, to spread the\nsails, and other ' talismanic tokens ' for steering the vessel, and because only\npart of the passengers became sick, he was consequently affecting them\nthrough Satanic agency ;\u2014or that it would alter the matter one whit because\nmedical men could not assign the true cause of this, or why any one should\nbe so affected ? \"\n\" Neukypnology.\"\n\" Neurypnology, or the Rationale of Nervous Sleep,\" was published by\nBraid in 1843, and 800 copies were sold in a few months.\nAt the seance already referred to, Braid had observed that the mesmeric\ncondition was induced by fixed staring, and concluded that the inability to\nopen the eyes arose from paralysis of certain nerve centres and exhaustion of\nthe levator muscles. \" I expressed,\" he said, \"my entire conviction that\nthe phenomena of mesmerism were to be accounted for on the principle of\nthe derangement of the state of the cerebral spinal centres, and of the\ncirculatory, respiratory and muscular systems, induced by a fixed stare,\nabsolute repose of body, fixed attention and suppressed respiration,\nconcomitant with that fixity of attention. That the whole depended on the\nphysical and psychical condition of the patient, arising from the causes\nreferred to, and not at all on the volition, or passes of the operator throwing\nout magnetic fluid, or exciting to activity some mystical, universal fluid or\nmedium.\"\nBraid induced hypnosis by making the subject look at a bright object,\nheld in such a position above the forehead as was calculated to produce the\ngreatest possible strain upon the eyes and eyelids, while at the same time the\nmind was to be riveted on the idea of that one object. Braid not only\nmaintained that the condition was a purely subjective one, produced in this\nmechanical way, but also claimed to have successfully demonstrated that it\ncould be induced in like manner in persons who had never heard of mesmerism\nand who were ignorant of what was expected of them. In illustration of\n\fSupplement.] James Braid; His Work and Writings. 131\nthis, he mentioned that he had hypnotised one of his servants, who knew\nnothing of mesmerism, by giving him such directions as were calculated to\nimpress his mind with the idea that his fixed attention was required merely\nfor the purpose of watching a chemical experiment with which he was\nalready familiar.\nAfter having established the subjective origin of the phenonema, Braid\nproposed that they should be called hypnotic, instead of mesmeric, and\ninvented the following terminology :\u2014\nNeurypnology, the rationale or doctrine of nervous sleep.\nNeuro-hypnotism, or nervous sleep, a peculiar condition of the nervous\nsystem produced by artificial contrivance.\nThen, for the sake of brevity, suppressing the prefix \"neuro,\" he gave\nthe following terms :\u2014\nHypnotic, the state or condition of nervous sleep.\nHypnotise, to induce nervous sleep.\nHypnotised, put into the condition of nervous sleep.\nHypnotism, nervous sleep.\nDehypnotise, to restore from the state of nervous sleep.\nHypnotist, one who practises neuro-hypnotism.\nThis terminology is closely followed at the present day, the main\ndifference being that one now speaks of the science of hypnotism, instead\nof that of neurypnology, applying the term hypnosis to the artificial sleep,\nand hypnotic both to the phenomena and to the subject in whom they are\ninduced.\nBraid at this date came to the following general conclusions :\u2014\n1. \"That the effect of a continued fixation of the mental and visual eye,\nin the manner and with the concomitant circumstances pointed out, is to\nthrow the nervous system into a new condition, accompanied with a state of\nsomnolence, and of a tendency, according to the mode of management, of\nexciting a variety of phenomena different from those we obtain either in the\nordinary sleep, or during the waking condition.\n2. \"That there is at first a state of high excitement of all the organs of\nspecial sense, sight excepted, and a great increase of muscular power ; and\nthat the senses afterwards become torpid in a much greater degree than what\noccurs in natural sleep.\n3. \"That in this condition we have the power of directing or con\ncentrating nervous energy, raising or depressing it in a remarkable degree\nat will, locally or generally.\n4. \"That in this state, we have the power of exciting the force and\nfrequency of the heart's action, and the state of the circulation, locally or\ngenerally, in a surprising degree.\n5. \"That whilst in this peculiar condition, we have the power of regulat\ning and controlling muscular tone and energy in a remarkable manner and\ndegree.\n6. \" That we also acquire the power of producing rapid and important\nchanges in the state of the capillary circulation, and on the whole of the\nsecretions and excretions of the body, as proved by the application of\nchemical tests.\nK 2\n\f132 [Supplement.\nDr. J. Milne Bramwell.\n7. \"That this power can be beneficially directed to the cure of a variety\nof diseases which were most intractable, or altogether incurable, by ordinary\ntreatment.\n8. \" That this agency may be rendered available in moderating, or\nentirely preventing, the pain incident to patients while undergoing surgical\noperations.\n9. \" That during hypnotism, by manipulating the cranium and face, we\ncan excite certain mental and bodily manifestations, according to the part\ntouched.\"\nAfter hypnotising his patients, Braid manipulated them in various ways,\nwith a view of producing changes in the muscular and circulatory systems,\nbelieving that this excited the different hypnotic phenomena and played an\nimportant part in the cure of disease. He also held that cures could some\ntimes be effected by similar methods in the waking condition. From the\ndescription of his manner of inducing hypnosis, it is evident that he employed\nverbal suggestion, but, at this time, this was apparently done unconsciously\nand in ignorance of its value.\nBraid found that he could terminate the hypnotic condition by means of\na current of cold air. He also noticed that he could make a rigid limb\nflexible by blowing on it ; that he could restore the sight to one eye by\nthe same means and leave the other insensible ; excite one half of the\nbody to action, while the other remained rigid and torpid, or make the\npatient pass from a general state of inactivity of the organs of special sense\nand tonic muscular rigidity to the opposite condition of extreme mobility\nand excited sensibility. He acknowledged that he was unable to explain\nthese extraordinary phenomena, but stated that he had no difficulty in\nreproducing them, that they were independent of any \"rapport\" between\noperator and patient and invariably appeared, no matter whether the current\nof air came from the lips, a pair of bellows, the motion of the hand, or any\ninanimate object.\nThe subjective explanation of the origin of mesmeric phenomena was not\na new one, and had already been given both by the Abbe' Faria and\nBertrand. Their views, however, if not entirely forgotten, exercised no\npractical influence on mesmeric theory, and Braid evidently was unacquainted\nwith them when he commenced his mesmeric researches ; thus, his conclusions\nwere arrived at independently, and successfully substituted for those\nuniversally held in his day. At a later date, when his opponents pointed\nout the similarity between the theories, Braid asserted that this was more\napparent than real, as Faria had attributed everything to the effect of the\nimagination ; on this point they differed, but were alike in asserting that\nneither contact nor magnetic fluid was necessary.\nAt this time Braid did not believe that the phenomena of hypnotism\nwere the result of attention, for, in speaking of some articles on animal\nmagnetism which had appeared in the Medical Gazette in 1833, he said :\n\"In the writer's opinion, the phenomena are the result of attention strongly\ndirectly to different parts of the body, whereas, by my method, the attention\nis riveted to something outside the body.\"\nIn opposition to the theory that hypnotism resembled reverie. Braid\nsaid : \"Reverie proceeds from an unusual quiescence of the brain, and\ninability of the mind to direct itself strongly to any one point. There is\n\fsupplement.] James Braid; his Work and Writings. 133\ndefect in the attention, which instead of being fixed on one subject, wanders\nover a thousand, and even on these is feebly and ineffectively directed. This\nis the very reverse of what is induced by my plan, because I rivet the\nattention to one idea, and the eyes to one point, as the primary and\nimperative condition.\"\nSome experiments which Braid made as to the methods of inducing\nhypnosis appear to have first suggested alterations in his hypnotic theory\nand shaken his faith in the purely physical explanation of hypnotic\nphenomena. At first he had required his patients to look for a considerable\ntime at some inanimate object, until the eyelids closed involuntarily. He\nfrequently found, however, that this was followed by pain and slight\nconjunctivitis, and, in order to avoid this, he closed the patient's eyes at\na much earlier stage. Despite this, he was able to hypnotise as easily as\nbefore and without subsequent unpleasant sensations. This led to further\nexperiment, when he found he could induce hypnosis as readily in the dark,\nor with the eyes bandaged, as in the light and with the eyes uncovered ; it\nbeing only necessary to keep the eyes fixed and the body and mind at\nabsolute rest. He always failed, however, in young children and in persons\nof weak intellect, or of restless and excitable minds, who were unable to\ncomply with these simple rules. As he succeeded with the blind, Braid\nconcluded that the impression was made' through the mind and not through\nthe optic nerve. \" It is important to remark,\" he said, \"that the oftener\npatients are hypnotised, from association of ideas and habits, the more\nsusceptible they become ; and in this way they are liable to be affected\nentirely through the imagination. Thus if they consider or imagine there is\nsomething doing, although they do not see it, from which they are to be\naffected, they will become affected ; but on the contrary, the most expert\nhypnotist in the world may exert all his efforts in vain, if the party does not\nexpect it, and mentally and bodily comply, and thus yield to it.\"\nBraid at first was inclined to believe in phrenology and considered it\npossible that the passions, emotions and intellectual faculties could be\nexcited during hypnosis by simple contact or friction over certain sympathetic\npoints of the head and face. He cited 12 cases in which he thought he had\nobserved these phenomena in subjects who were ignorant of phrenology,\nand who were not influenced by previous training, or by leading questions\nand suggestions on the part of the operator. He was not satisfied with\nthese results, however, and stated that it was his intention to conduct a new\nseries of experiments on fresh patients in order to ascertain to what extent\nit might be practicable, by arbitrary associations, to excite the opposite\ntendencies from the same point. He also thought it probable that errors\nmight have arisen through the remarkable docility of hypnotic subjects,\nwhich made them anxious to comply with every suggestion or indication\ngiven by the operator. In reference to the proposed further experiments,\nhe said, \"There will thus be both positive and negative proof to aid us in\ndetermining whether there is any natural and necessary connection existing\nbetween the points manipulated and the manifestations excited ; whether it\nmay depend entirely upon associations which have originated from some\npartial knowledge of phrenology, from arbitrary arrangement, or accidental\ncircumstances or causes which have been entirely overlooked or forgotten ;\n\fDr. J. Milne Bramwell. [Supplement.\nand which afterwards produce the result from that ultimate law of the mind,\nwhich ordains that the repetition of a definite sensation shall be followed by\na renovation of the past feelings with which it was before associated. I am\ninclined to adopt this course, from my anxiety to remove every possible\nsource of error, my object being neither to prove nor disprove the truth of\nphrenology. That during the nervous sleep, there is a power of exciting\npatients to manifest the passions and emotions, and certain mental functions,\nin a more striking manner than the same individuals are capable of in the\nwaking condition, no one can doubt who has seen much of these experiments.\nAnd it can in no way alter the importance of hypnotism as a curative power\nand extraordinary means of controlling and directing mental functions in\na peculiar manner, by a simple association of impressions, whether we thus\nact on the brain as a single organ, or as a combination of separate organs ; or\nwhether the primary associations have originated from a special organic\nconnection, or from some accidental and unknown cause, or from precon-\nsulted arrangement and arbitrary association.\"\nThe following account of some hypnotic phenomena is drawn partly from\n\" Neurypnology,\" and partly from other sources.\nBraid recognised two distinct hypnotic conditions, which correspond\npractically with the late Mr. Edmund Gurney's \"alert\" and \"deep\"\nstages, also intermediate states between the two, one frequently gliding\nimperceptibly into the other. The deep stage was characterised by a\ncondition of torpor more profound than that of natural sleep ; the alert by\nexaltation of the special senses, increase in muscular sense and power, and\nexaltation of certain mental faculties. By the sense of smell, some patients\nwere able to detect any person known to them, or to find the owner of any\nglove. They first smelt the glove and then unhesitatingly presented it to\nits owner, choosing him from amongst a large company. If the nostrils\nwere stopped, however, the apparent clairvoyant faculty instantly\ndisappeared. The sense of touch and the muscular sense were sometimes so\nremarkably increased that some subjects were able to write with great\naccuracy during hypnosis, when effectual precautions were taken to prevent\ntheir being able to see. They crossed the t's and dotted the i's and could\neven go back a line, strike out a letter and put it in its proper place. One\npatient could correct the writing on a whole page of note-paper, but if the\nrelative positions of the table and paper were changed, the alterations ceased\nto be placed correctly. The following is an interesting account, published\nin the Medical Times for September, 1847, by an independent observer, of the\npower possessed by certain somnambules of imitating language and song.\n\"On Tuesday last, the 3rd hist., Mile. Jenny Lind, accompanied by\nMr. and Mrs. Schwabe, and a few of their friends, attended a stance at\nMr. Braid's for the purpose of witnessing some of the extraordinary\nphenomena of hypnotism. There were two girls who work in a warehouse,\nand who had just come in their working attire. Having thrown them into\nthe sleep, Mr. Braid sat down to the piano, and the moment he began\nplaying, both somnambules arose and approached the instrument, when they\njoined him in a trio. Having awoke one of the girls, Mr. Braid said,\nalthough she was ignorant of the grammar of her own language when awake,\nthat when in the sleep she would prove herself competent to accompany\n\fSupplement.] James Braid; his Work and Writings. 135\nany one in the room in singing songs in any language, giving both notes and\nwords correctly\u2014a feat which she was quite incompetent to perform in the\nwaking condition. He then requested any one in the room to put her to the\ntest, when Mr. Schwabe sat down to the instrument, and played and sang a\nGerman song, in which she accompanied him correctly, giving both notes\nand words simultaneously with Mr. Schwabe. Another gentleman then tried\nher with one in Swedish, in which she succeeded. Next the queen of song,\nthe far-famed Jenny Lind, sat down to the instrument and sang most\nbeautifully a slow air, with Swedish words, which the somnambulist\naccompanied her in, in the most perfect manner both as regards words and\nmusic. Jenny now seemed resolved to test the powers of the somnambulist\nto the utmost by a continued strain of the most difficult roulades and\ncadenzas, for which she is so famous, including some of her extraordinary\nsostentuto notes, with all their inflections from pianissimo to forte crescendo,\nand again diminishing to thread-like pianissimo, but in all these fantastic\ntricks and displays of genius by the Swedish nightingale, even to the shake,\nshe was so closely and accurately tracked by the somnambulist, that several\nin the room occasionally could not have told, merely by hearing, that there\nwere two individuals singing\u2014so instantaneously did she catch the notes, and\nso perfectly did their voices blend and accord. Next, Jenny having been told\nby Mr. Braid that she might be tested in some other language, this charming\nsongstress commenced ' Casta Diva, ' and the ' A la Bell a mi Ititornella, '\nin which the fidelity of the somnambulist's performance, both in words and\nmusic, was most perfect, and fully justified all Mr. Braid had alleged\nregarding her powers. She was also tested by Mile. Lind in merely\nimitating language, when she gave most exact imitations ; and Mr. Schwabe\nalso tried her by some most difficult combinations of sound, which he said he\nknew no one was capable of imitating correctly without much practice, but the\nsomnambulist imitated them correctly at once, and that whether spoken slowly\nor quickly. When the girl was aroused, she had no recollection of anything\nwhich had been done by her, or that she had afforded such a high gratifica\ntion to all present, by proving the wonderful powers of imitation which are\nacquired by some patients during a state of artificial somnambulism ; she\nsaid she merely felt somewhat out of breath, as if she had been running.\"\nDespite long perseverance, Braid never succeeded in hypnotising idiots,\nand he found that one patient, who had been easily hypnotised when well,\nbecame refractory during the delirium of fever. With the majority of his\npatients there was no loss of consciousness ; they simply became lethargic\nand retained complete recollection of all that had occurred ; with others many\nhypnotic phenomena could be produced without their having previously\npassed through a condition in any way resembling sleep. This state was\npopularly described as the \"electro-biological,\" a name which Braid justly\ntermed ridiculous. In some instances hypnotised patients, even after having\nundergone surgical operations, remembered nothing, while others, to whom\nhe had taught Greek, Latin, French, and Italian during hypnosis, forgot it\nall when awake. When rehypnotised the lost memory frequently returned\nspontaneously, but if it did not do so, the operator could revive it by placing\nhis hand on any part of the patient's body and thus giving a physical aid to\nthe concentration of attention. Suggestions made to these patients during\n\f136 [Supplement.\nDr. J. Milne Bramwell.\nhypnosis were fulfilled in the waking state, despite the fact that they had\napparently been entirely forgotten.\nAnalogous States.\nIn hypnotism, Braid found an explanation of the prolonged trance of the\nfakirs and of the voluntary suspended animation of Colonel Townsend ; some\ninstances of the former being remarkably well authenticated by the evidence\nof English officers of position. On one occasion a fakir was buried at a\ndepth of four feet ; it was arranged that the experiment should last nine days\nand an English officer had the grave constantly watched by sentinels. At\nthe end of the third day, the officer, fearing the fakir might be dead, and that\nthis would be the cause of trouble to himself, insisted on the termination of\nthe experiment. When the man was dug up he was as stiff and cold as a\nmummy and apparently lifeless ; he revived, however, after being manipulated\nfor about a quarter of an hour.\nBraid considered that there was a marked resemblance between the\ncondition produced by hashisch and certain hypnotic states, and in support of\nthis, quoted the following experiments made by Dr. O'Shaughnessy at\nCalcutta, and published in Pereira's \"Elements of Materia Medioa\"; \u2014\n\"At 2 p.m. a grain of the resin of hemp was given to a rheumatic patient.\nAt 4 p.m. he was very talkative, sang, called loudly for an extra supply of\nfood and declared himself in perfect health. At 6 p.m. he was asleep. At\n8 p.m. he was found insensible, but breathing with perfect regularity, the\npulse and skin natural, and the pupils freely contractile on the approach of\nlight. Happening by chance to lift up the patient's arm, the professional\nreader will judge of my astonishment, \" observes Dr. O., \"when I found it\nremained in the posture in which I had placed it. The patient had become\ncataleptic. We raised him to a sitting posture, and placed his arms and\nlimbs in every imaginable attitude. A waxen figure could not be more\npliant. He continued in this state till 1 a.m., when consciousness and\nvoluntary motion quickly returned. \" A similar experiment was made with\nanother patient with like results.\nBefore considering the later works, it will be well to examine some of\nthe opinions expressed in reference to Braid, which apparently indicate that\nthe writers were acquainted with \"Neurypnology\" alone. Dr. Bastian, in\nhis article on Braidism in Quain's Dictionary of Medicine, expressed his\nregret that Braid did not reject all the so-called phenomena of phreno-\nhypnotism. Professor Romanes also appears to have been only acquainted\nwith \" Neurypnology, \" and mentions it alone in his article on Hypnotism\nin the Nineteenth Century for September, 1880. He refers to the fact that\nHeidenhain omits all reference to Braid and maintains that it would be\ndoing scant justice to Neurypnology to say that all Heidenhain's results had\nbeen anticipated. For, \"in the vast number of careful experiments which it\n[Neurypnology] records\u2014all undertaken and prosecuted in a manner strictly\nscientific\u2014it carried the inquiry into various provinces which have not been\nentered by Heidenhain. No one can read Braid's work without being\nimpressed by the care and candour with which, amid violent opposition from\nall quarters, his investigations were pursued ; and now, when after the lapse\nof nearly 40 years, his results are beginning to receive the confirmation\n\fsupplement.] James Braid; his Work and Writings. 137\nwhich they deserve, the physiologists who yield it ought not to forget the\ncredit that is due to the earliest, the most laborious, and the hitherto most\nextensive investigator of the phenomena of what he calls hypnotism.\"\nThe following passage in \" Suggestive Therapeutics,\" published in 1890,\nshows that, at that date at all events, Bernheim was unacquainted with\nBraid's advanced theories :\u2014\"Braid made use of suggestion without knowing\nit. We must come down to 1880 to find the doctrine of suggestion freed\nfrom all the elements that falsified it, even in the hands of Braid himself,\nand applied in the simplest manner to therapeutics. The patient is put to\nsleep by means of suggestion. He is treated by means of suggestion. The\nsubject being hypnotised, Li\u00e9beault's method consists in affirming in a loud\nvoice the disappearance of his symptoms. Such is the method of therapeutic\nsuggestion of which M. LWbeault is the founder. He was the first to clearly\nestablish that the cures of pain by the old magnetisers, and even by Braid's\nhypnotic operations, are not the work either of a mysterious fluid or of\nphysiological modifications due to special manipulations, but the work of\nsuggestion alone.\"\nIn the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research for March, 1896,\nM. Boirac, in replying to Dr. Walter Leaf's criticism of \" L'Hypothese du\nMagn\u00e9tisme Animal,\" which appeared in the number of the Proceedings for\nDecember, 1895 (Part XXIX.), states that he associates Braid with the\nParis School (hypnotism) and Faria with the Nancy School (suggestion).\nGeneral Theory.\nIn the commencement of \" Neurypnology, \" as we have seen, Braid\nexplained hypnotic phenomena mainly from the physical standpoint, and\nheld that they could be induced by fixed staring at an inanimate object,\neven in persons who had heard nothing of hypnotism or mesmerism, and\nwho were ignorant of what was required of them. In the later chapters,\nhowever, these views were considerably modified and he talks of persons\nbeing hypnotised entirely through their imagination, and also of the useless-\nness of the efforts of the most expert mesmeriser if the patient were ignorant\nof his aims. In his other works the physical theory is entirely abandoned in\nfavour of a purely psychical one. After explaining what induced him to adopt\nthe term hypnotism in preference to that of mesmerism, he stated that the\nword hypnotism was liable to grave objections, as under it had been\ncomprised, not a single state, but a series of stages or conditions varying in\nevery conceivable degree, and that:\u2014\"In correct phraseology, the term\nhypnotism ought to be restricted to the phenomena manifested in patients\nwho actually pass into a state of sleep, and who remember nothing on\nawakening of what has transpired. Of those who may be relieved or cured\nby hypnotic processes, perhaps not more than one in ten ever passes into\nthe state of oblivious sleep. The term hypnotism, therefore, is apt to confuse\nthem and lead them to suspect that they cannot be benefited by processes\nwhich fail to produce the most obvious indication which their name imports.\"\nBraid, therefore, proposed to alone call hypnotic those cases of artificial\nsleep followed by amnesia on awakening, but in which there is perfect\nrecollection of what has happened when the patient is again hypnotised.\nHypnotic coma he described as that deeper stage in which the lost memory\n\f138 Br. J. Milne BramweU. [Supplement.\nis not revived in subsequent hypnoses. \" I became satisfied,\" he said,\n\"that the hypnotic state was essentially a state of mental concentration,\nduring which the faculties of the mind of the patient were so engrossed with\na single idea or train of thought as, for the nonce, to render it dead or\nindifferent to all other considerations and influences. The consequence of\nthis concentrated attention, again, to the subject in hand, intensified, in a\ncorrespondingly greater degree, whatever influence the mind of the\nindividual could produce upon his physical functions during the waking\ncondition, when his attention was so much more diffused and distracted by\nother impressions. Moreover, inasmuch as words spoken, or various sensible\nimpressions made on the body of an individual by a second party, act as\nsuggestions of thought and action to the person impressed, so as to draw and\nfix his attention to one part or function of his body, and withdraw it from\nothers, \u2014whatever influence suggestions and impressions are capable of\nproducing during the ordinary waking condition, should naturally be\nexpected to act with correspondingly greater effect during the nervous sleep,\nwhen the attention is so much more concentrated, and the imagination, faith,\nand expectant ideas in the mind of the patient are so much more intense\nthan in the ordinary waking condition. Now, this is precisely what\nhappens ; and I am persuaded that this is the most philosophical mode of\nviewing the subject ; and it renders the whole clear, simple, and\nintelligible to the apprehension of the unprejudiced person, who may at\nonce perceive that the real object and tendency of the various processes for\ninducing a state of hypnotism or mesmerism is obviously to induce a state of\nabstraction or concentration of attention\u2014that is, a state of monoideism,\nwhether that may be by requesting the subject to look steadfastly at some\nunexciting, and empty inanimate thing, or ideal object, or inducing him to\nwatch the fixed gaze of the operator's eyes, his pointed fingers, or\nother manoeuvres of the mesmeriser. . . . Then, inasmuch as I feel\nsatisfied that the mental and physical phenomena which flow from the said\nprocesses result entirely from the mental impressions or dominant ideas,\nexcited thereby in the minds of the subjects, changing or modifying the\npreviously existing physical action, and the peculiar physical action thus\nsuperinduced reacting on their minds\u2014and that, whether these dominant\nexpectant ideas existed in the minds of the subjects previously, or were\nsuggested to them after passing into the impressible condition, by audible\nsuggestions or sensible impressions excited by manipulations of a second party\n\u2014under these circumstances, I consider the following terms calculated to\nrealise all the precision which we may desire on this point.\n' ' Let Mono-ideology indicate the doctrine of the influence of dominant\nideas in controlling mental and physical actions.\n' ' Then Monoideism will indicate the condition resulting from the mind\nbeing possessed by dominant ideas.\n\"To monoideise will indicate the act of performing processes for inducing\nthe act of monoideism.\n\" Monoideiser will indicate the person who monoideises.\n\" Monoideised will indicate the condition of the person who is in a state\nof monoideism.\n\fsupplement.] James Braid; his Work and Writings. 139\n' ' And Monoideo-Dynamics will indicate the mental and physical changes,\nwhether of excitement or depression, which result from the influence of\nmonoideism.\n\" And, finally, as a generic term, comprising the whole of these phenomena\nwhich result from the reciprocal actions of mind and matter upon each other,\nI think no term could be more appropriate than Psycho-Physiology.\"\nThis theory was first published by Braid in 1847. The fascination of\nbirds by serpents, the phenomena of electro-biology, of table-turning, the\ngyrations of the odometer of Dr. Mayo, the magnetometer of Mr. Rutter, the\nmovements of the divining rod, the supposed levity of the human body when\nlifted on the tips of the fingers of four individuals, were all, according to\nBraid, examples of unconscious or involuntary muscular action resulting\nfrom dominant ideas. When the attention of man or animal, he said, is\nabsorbed by an idea associated with movement, a current of nervous force\nis sent into the muscles and a corresponding motion produced, not only\nwithout conscious effort, but even in many instances in opposition to the\nvolition. The subject loses the power of neutralizing the dominant idea and\nis irresistibly drawn or spellbound according to the nature of the impression\nproduced, and may, in this way, be brought under the control of others by\nmeans of audible, visible, and tangible suggestions.\nThe mental and physical phenomena, no matter what processes were\nemployed to induce hypnosis, resulted entirely from the mental impressions,\nor dominant ideas, thereby excited in the minds of the subjects. It was a\nmatter of indifference whether these ideas existed in the subject's mind\npreviously, or were afterwards suggested by audible suggestions or sensory\nimpressions created by the manipulations of the operator.\nBraid held that the operator acted like an engineer and called into action\nthe forces in the patient's own organism, and controlled and directed them\nin accordance with the laws which governed the action of the mind upon the\nbody.\nIn reference to \"Electro-Biological Phenomena, considered physiologically\nand psychologically,\" published in 1851, Braid stated that its object was to\nprove the subjectivity of the hypnotic and mesmeric condition, and to show\nthat the phenomena resulted from the concentrated mental attention of the\npatient acting on his own physical organism, and of the changed condition\nof the physical action thus induced reacting on the mind of the patient.\nThat the changed physical condition arose from the action of predominant\nideas, and that these ideas might arise in the minds of the patients, and\nbecome operative on them, through their own unaided acts\u2014or from the\nmere remembrance of past feelings, without any co-operation or act of a\nsecond party ; and that, in certain subjects, they might also be excited by\naudible, visible, or tangible suggestions from another person, to any extent\nwhatever,\u2014even liefore they passed into a state of sleep. Braid stated that\nhe had held and endeavoured to prove this theory more than Jive years\npreviously.\nIn reply to a writer who had adopted in a modified form the objective\ntheory of mesmeric phenomena, Braid says :\u2014\" If Mr. Newnham would only\ncondescend to consider the simple subjective theory which I have ventured\nto propound, I think he might readily comprehend how the new modes of\n\f140 [Supplement.\nDr. J. Milne Bramwell.\nexcitement, or depression, or peculiar distribution of the nervous or vital\ninfluence within the patient's own body might arise through the influence of\nhis own mind acting on his physical organism, and might thus account for all\nwhich is realised without the transmission of any occult influence from one\nhuman being to another. I readily grant, however, that the looks, words\nand actions of a second party may furnish suggestions influential upon others\n\u2014just as a word of encouragement, spoken or written by a friend, may neive\nour arm with greater power, and inspire our tongue with greater eloquence\n\u2014and that a lively companion, or encouraging expression may excite us ;\nwhilst a grave companion or doubtful expression would chill and depress\u2014\nand that hope and confidence, or the contrary, in the means used, may\nmodify, to a remarkable extent, the results under any mode of treatment.\nStill, I believe that there is no positive interchange or transference of\nnervous or vital force from the operator to the patient as the actual cause of\nthese results, as has been alleged by the mesmerists. I do not believe that,\nin such instances, A loses an amount of power equivalent to what B gains ;\nI do not believe that a preacher, an orator, or an author loses an amount\nof vital force in exact ratio to the numbers influenced by his spoken or\nprinted ideas, sentiments and illustrations,\u2014which would necessarily be\nthe case were the magnetic theory true. On the contrary, I do believe\nthat the perusal of a posthumous work might be equally influential as\nif the book had been printed when the author was alive\u2014and that the\nsimple suggestion of new ideas to the mind of the reader, through the\nprinted symbols of thought, is the real efficient cause of the future\nresults.\"\nIn \" Neurypnology,\" Braid stated that he was unable to account for the\naction of a current of air upon hypnotised subjects ; at a later date he gave\nthe following theory. In hypnosis the attention is concentrated upon the\nparticular function called into action, while the others merge into a state of\ntorpor; thus, only one function is active at any one time and hence intensely\nso. The arousing of any dormant function is equivalent to superseding the\none in action, and he explained, therefore, the termination of a state of\nmuscular rigidity when a current of cold air is directed to the skin, by\nsuggesting that this called the attention to the skin, and withdrew it from\nthe muscular sense.\nBraid considered the following to be the chief points of difference\nbetween spontaneous and induced somnambulism. Spontaneous somnambu\nlists are impelled to certain trains of action by internal impulses, while the\ninduced tend to remain at absolute rest and to lapse into a state of profound\nsleep, unless excited by some impression from without.\nNatural and artificial sleep were not regarded by Braid as identical, and\nthe following are further points of contrast in addition to those already\nmentioned (pp. 131 \u2014 2). The pupils are dilated in hypnosis and the\neyelids either quiver continuously, or are firmly closed by spasmodic\ncontractions. In passing into hypnosis, anything held in the hand is grasped\nstill more firmly. There is an increase of the muscular sense, and hypnotic\nsubjects possess an extraordinary power of balancing themselves Chronic\nrigidity of the muscles is not followed by corresponding exhaustion. Some\ntimes in the hypnotic state there is excitement, similar to that produced by\n\fsupplement.] James Braid; his Work and Writings. 141\nwines and spirits, at others there is muscular quiescence, with acute hearing\nand dreamy, glowing imagination, closely resembling the condition induced\nbyConiuin. \"The principal difference,\" he said, \"between the hypnotic\nor nervous sleep and common sleep consists in the state or condition of\nthe mind. In passing into common sleep, the mind is diffusive or passive,\nflitting from one idea to another indifferently, thereby rendering the subject\nunable to fix his attention on any regular train of thought, or to perform\nany acts requiring much effort of will. The consequence of this is that a\nstate of passiveness is manifested during the sleep, so that audible\nsuggestions and sensible impressions addressed to the sleeper, if not intense\nenough to wake him entirely, seldom do more than excite a dream, in which\nideas pass through his mind without exciting definite physical acts ; but, on\nthe other hand, the active and concentrated state of the mind engendered\nby the processes for inducing the nervous sleep, are carried into the sleep,\nand, in many instances, excite the sleeper, without awaking, to speak or to\nexhibit physical manifestations of the suggestions received through words\naudibly uttered in his hearing, or ideas previously existing in his mind, or\nexcited by sensible impressions made by touches or passes of the operator,\nwhich direct the attention of the sleeper to different parts, or excite into\naction certain combinations of muscles, and thereby direct his current of\nthought. \" Another difference is the wonderful power of hypnosis in curing\nmany diseases, which had resisted natural sleep and every known agency\nfor years. For instance, a few hypnotic seances of ten minutes each cured\na patient who must have had during his long illness at least eight years'\nsleep.\nMagnets, etc.\nIn Braid's time the mesmerists held that magnets, certain metals, crystals,\netc., possessed a peculiar power and, with sensitive subjects, were capable of\nproducing attraction and other remarkable phenomena. Some experienced\nan unpleasant sensation like an aura, others got headache, or attacks of\nfainting or catalepsy, with spasms so violent that they apparently endangered\nlife. Frequently there was hypereesthesia of the special senses. Many\nalso fancied they saw fiery bundles of light stream from the poles of the\nmagnet. All this was said to happen even when the subjects did not see\nthe magnets and did not know what was being done. Braid performed many\nexperiments in order to test these statements, with the following results :\u2014-\nthe phenomena appeared when the patients had preconceived ideas on the\nsubject, or when these were excited by leading questions, but were\ninvariably absent when they were ignorant of what was being done.\nPretended magnets also produced the phenomena when the patients knew\nwhat was expected to occur. Reichenbach recorded an instance where, by\nthe mere exposure of a sensitive plate in a box with a magnet, an impression\nhad been made, as if it had been exposed to the full influence of the light.\nBraid repeated the experiment, and also had similar ones performed for him\nl>y an expert photographer and, when all sources of fallacy were guarded\nagainst, the results were invariably negative. According to Braid, the mind\nof the patient alone was sufficient to produce the effects attributed to\nmagnetic or odyllic force and suggested ideas were capable of exciting a great\nvariety of physical sensations and mental conditions.\n\f142 [Supplement.\nBr. J. Milne Bramwell.\nThe following is an account of an experiment of Braid's to show that\nsuggestion was the true explanation of the supposed mesmeric powers of\nmagnets and certain metals :\u2014\"When in London lately,\" he said, \"I had\nthe pleasure of calling upon an eminent and excellent physician, who is in\nthe habit of using mesmerism in his practice, in suitable cases, just as he\nuses any other remedy. He spoke of the extraordinary effects he had\nexperienced from the use of magnets applied during the mesmeric state, and\nkindly offered to illustrate the fact on a patient who had been asleep all the\ntime I was in the room, and in that state during which I felt assured she\ncould overhear every word of our conversation. He told me that when he\nput the magnet into her hands, it would produce catalepsy of the hands and\narms, and such was the result. He wafted the hands and the catalepsy\nceased. He said that the mere touch of a magnet on a limb would stiffen it,\nand such he proved to be the fact.\n\" I now told him that I had got a little instrument in my pocket, which\nalthough far less than his, I felt assured would prove quite as powerful, and\nI offered to prove this by operating on the same patient, whom I had never\nseen before, and who was in the mesmeric state when I entered the room.\nMy instrument was about three inches long, the thickness of a quill, with a\nring attached to the end of it. I told him that when put into her hands, he\nwould find it catalepsize both hands and arms, as his had done, and such was\nthe result. Having reduced this by wafting, I took the instrument from\nher, and again returned it, in another position, and told him it would now\nhave the very reverse effect,\u2014that she would not be able to hold it, and that\nalthough I closed her hands on it, they would open and that it would drop\nout of them, and such was the case,\u2014to the great surprise of my worthy\nfriend, who now desired to be informed what I had done to the instrument\nto invest it with such new and opposite power. This I declined doing for\nthe present ; but I promised to do so when he had seen some further\nproofs of its remarkable powers. I now told him that a touch with it, on\neither extremity, would cause the extremity to rise and become cataleptic,\nand such was the result ; that a second touch on the same part would reduc&\nthe rigidity, and cause it to fall, and such again was proved to be the fact.\nAfter a variety of other experiments, every one of which proved precisely as.\nI had predicted, she was aroused.\n\" I now applied the ring of my instrument on the third finger of the right\nhand, from which it was suspended, and told the doctor, when it was so-\nsuspended, it would send her to sleep. [To this he replied, ' It never will, '\nbut I again told him that I felt confident that it would send her to sleep.]\nWe then were silent, and very speedily she was once more asleep. Having\naroused her, I put the instrument on the second finger of her left hand, and\ntold the doctor it would be found she could not go to sleep when it was-\nplaced there. He said he thought she would, and he sat steadily gazing at\nher, but I said firmly and confidently that she would not. After a consider\nable time, the doctor asked her if she did not feel sleepy, to which she-\nreplied, ' Not at all. ' ' Could you rise and walk ? ' When she told him she-\ncould, I then requested her to look at the point of the forefinger of her\nright hand, which I told the doctor would send her to sleep, and such was.\nthe result ; after being aroused, I desired her to keep a steady gaze at the\n\fSupplement.] James Braid; his Work and Writings. 143\nnail of the thumb of the left hand, which would send her to sleep in like\nmanner, and such proved to be the fact.\n\"Having repaired to another room, I explained to the doctor the real\nnature and powers of my little and apparently magical instrument, that it\nwas nothing more than my portmanteau key and ring, and that what had\nimparted to it such apparently varied powers was merely the predictions\nwhich the patient had overheard me make to him, acting upon her in the\npeculiar state of the nervous sleep, as irresistible impulses to be effected,\naccording to the results she had heard me predict. Had I predicted that\nshe would see any flame, or colour, or form, or substance, animate or\ninanimate, I knew from experience that such would have been realised, and\nresponded to by her ; and that, not from any desire on her part to impose\nupon others, but because she was self-deceived, the vividness of her\nimagination in that state inducing her to believe, as real, what were only the\nfigments of fancy, suggested to her mind by the remarks of others. The\npower of suggestions of this sort also in paralysing or energising muscular\npower is truly astonishing ; and may all arise in perfect good faith with\nalmost all patients who have passed into the second conscious state and with\nsome during the first conscious state.\"\nIn 1843, Braid referred to Elliotson's belief in the powers of certain\nmetals, and to Wakley's experiments. The latter, operating with a non-\nmesmerising metal, made the patient believe he was using a mesmerising\none, whereupon she fell asleep ; and he concluded that all the subjects were\nimpostors. Braid denied this, asserting that the active agent was simply the\nimagination, and that the metals were neither mesmeric nor non-mesmeric.\nIn the same way, he explained the action of the wooden tractors which\nDr. Hayarth, in 1799, successfully substituted for the metal ones of\nMr. Perkins. The latter consisted of two pieces of metal, one apparently of\niron and the other of brass, about three inches long, blunt at one end and\npointed at the other. They were invented by Dr. Elisha Perkins, of\nNorwich, Connecticut, who in 1796 took out a patent for them, and were\napplied by drawing them lightly over the part affected for about 20 minutes.\nThis method of treatment, which was very fashionable at one time, was\ntermed Perkinism, in honour of its inventor.\nAccording to Braid, it had long been recognised that various anomalous\nsensations followed the prolonged direction of the attention to any part of\nthe body; but notwithstanding the fact that remarkable cures had occasionally\nbeen caused by mental excitement, and severe illness and even death had\nresulted from fear, it was usually supposed that these anomalous sensations\nwere unaccompanied by physical change. With the exception of Dr. Holland,\nwho wrote on the influence of attention on the bodily organs in his \" Medical\nNotes and Reflections,\" no one, Braid said, entertained the idea that definite\nand special physical changes conld be excited, regulated, and controlled at\nwill by the voluntary mental efforts of a healthy individual directed towards\nhis own body ; or that the same results might be produced involuntarily, by\nthe suggestions of another person conveyed directly, verbally, or indirectly,\nby means of passes, etc.\nThe following are examples of the power of suggestion in causing\nalterations in bodily function :\u2014\" I had told a friend,\" Braid said, \"that\n\fDr. J. Milne Bramwell. [Supplement.\nit sufficed to arouse certain ideas as to her condition in the patient's mind in\norder to produce the corresponding alterations in the functions of the organ\nor part of the body referred to ; as he was not inclined to believe my\nstatement, I told him I could increase the secretion of milk in one of his\nwife's breasts (she happened to be nursing a child at the time), by calling her\nattention to the breast during hypnosis. Eight months previously I had\nhypnotised this lady and cured her of severe headache. She was a good\nsomnambule.\" After obtaining the patient's consent, but without telling\nher of the proposed experiment, Braid hypnotised her and drew her attention\nto her breast. On being awakened, she remembered nothing of what had\nbeen said or done, but complained of a feeling of tightness and tension in\nthe breast. Her husband then told her that Braid had been trying to\nincrease the secretion of milk. She replied, \" That would be no light\nmatter, for my child is 14 months old, and I have hardly any milk.\" Braid\nasked her to send for the child and to put it to the breast, when it got so\nmuch milk that it was nearly choked. A few days later the patient\ncomplained that her figure was deformed in consequence of the swelling of\nthe left breast. Braid hypnotised her again and repeated the experiment\nwith the right breast. The result was precisely the same, and both breasts\nnow secreted so much milk that the lady was able to suckle her child for six\nmonths longer, whereas before she had always complained of lack of milk.\nThe value of the hypnotic mode of treatment was best shown, according\nto Braid, by \"cases of hysterical paralysis, in which, without organic\nlesion, the patient may have remained for a considerable length of time\nperfectly powerless of a part, or of the whole body, from a dominant idea\nwhich has paralysed or misdirected his volition. In such cases, by altering\nthe state of the circulation, and breaking down the previous idea, and\nsubstituting a salutary idea of vigour and self-confidence in its place, which\ncan be done by audible suggestions addressed to the patient, in a confident tone\nof voice, as to what mnst and shall be realised by the processes he has been\nsubjected to, \u2014on being aroused a few minutes afterwards,with such dominant\nidea in their minds, to the astonishment of themselves as well as of others,\nthe patients are found to have acquired vigour and voluntary power over\ntheir hitherto paralysed limbs, as by a magical spell of witchcraft.\"\nThe power of imagination and excited attention, in producing a specific\ninfluence in a healthy person, was beautifully illustrated, he said, in the\nfollowing case : ' ' Having heard an account of some extraordinary discovery\nin America, of certain medicines which could manifest their influence through\nglass, that is, that by taking hold of a phial in which the medicine was\ncontained, it would impart its peculiar medicinal virtue through the closed\nphial ;\u2014having read this account, I named it to certain parties, who scouted\nthe idea as preposterous. I told them I did not doubt the fact of such\nphysical effects resulting from such means, but added that I very strongly\nsuspected the correctness of the physiology of the explanation. I was\ninclined to believe it quite possible that it arose from vivid imagination,\nattention and expectation, exciting the particular function to be acted upon.\nThis they scouted as equally preposterous, which induced me to repeat my\nconviction of the possibility of such a result taking place [although I had\nnever tried it], and I also proposed to test it forthwith, in their presence.\n\fSupplement.] James Braid ; his Work and Writings. 145\nWith this view, I requested an ounce phial to be brought to me, filled with\ncommon water, coloured with syrup of poppies, which I meant to use for the\npurpose of acting as an emetic. We then repaired to a room, where there\nwas a female friend, who knew nothing of our intentions. I then commenced\ntalking to the gentlemen, but so that she could hear the conversation, about\nthe remarkable discovery of this extraordinary medium, which could act as\nan emetic through the glass. I then requested this lady to oblige me by\ntrying its effects. She was very unwilling to encounter it, but at length was\nprevailed upon to do so, by my assuring her it would much oblige me, and\nwe could all place the most implicit confidence in her veracity. She very\nsoon stated that it gave her an unpleasant feeling extending up the arm. I\nencouraged her to persevere, assuring her it would only make her sick, and\nadded that when it got as high as the shoulder it would suddenly dart across\nthe chest, when it would induce vomiting. When the feeling had extended\nas far as the elbow, we observed her become as pale as ashes, and from this\nit speedily mounted to the shoulder and across the chest, and was evidently\nabout to be followed by vomiting had I not suddenly put an end to the\nexperiment. This I did by desiring her to take another phial into the\nother hand, which would neutralise the effects of the emetic phial. The\nresult was equally successful. The experiment did not last more than two\nor three minutes. I repeated the experiment a second time with the same\npatient, with like effect.\" ... \"A consideration of these facts,\" Braid\nsaid, \"renders it easy to understand how hypnotism may become available\nfor the relief and cure of various diseases. By various modes of suggestion,\neither by audible language, spoken within the hearing of the patient, or by\ndefinite physical impressions, certain ideas are fixed strongly and involuntarily\nin the mind of the patient. These act as stimulants or sedatives, according\nto the nature of the expectant idea, and either direct attention to, or\nwithdraw it from, particular organs or functions. Similar results are effected\nin ordinary practice, by prescribing medicines which stimulate or irritate\nthese organs, thereby directly increasing their functions, or which produce\nthe reverse effect, either by direct sedative action on the organs, or by\ndiminishing the heart's action, or by stimulating some distant part, and\nthereby producing revulsion. The great object of all treatment is either to\nexcite or to depress function, or to increase or to diminish the existing\nstate of sensibility and circulation locally or generally, with the necessary\nattendant changes in the general, and more especially in the capillary,\ncirculation. For this purpose I feel convinced that hypnotism may be\napplied in the cure of some forms of disease, with the same ease and\ncertainty as our most approved methods of treatment.\"\nBraid cited the alteration in the capillary circulation which takes place\nin the phenomenon of blushing and which may appear immediately as the\nresult of a mental impression. \"Where then,\" he asks, \" is the difficulty\nin comprehending why a dominant expectant idea in the mind of the patient\nshould be adequate to produce effects equally potent on other parts of the\nbody, and in special organs, when strongly concentrated on such organs or\nparts 1 The same effects are produced then by hypnotism as are produced\nby various drugs which depress or excite the circulation. In other cases\nhypnotism may be supposed to act as an alterative, producing a new action\nh\n\f146 [Supplement.\nDr. J. Milne Bramwell.\nor counter impression, during which the morbid action is suspended, which\naffords an opportunity for a natural and healthy action to be resumed when\nthe influence of hypnotism is suspended.\" In support of this theory. Braid\ncalled attention to the number of recoveries which took place during the use\nof infinitesimally small doses of medicine in homeopathic practice. These,\nhe said, benefited the patient, not by their physical or chemical qualities,\nbut as suggestions, and quoted Professor Simpson, who had proved that in\none homoeopathic dilution a patient would have to take a dose every second\nof time, night and day, for 30,000 years before he consumed one grain of\nthe original drug, while another was so attenuated that it would require a\nmass of the dilution equal to 61 times the size of the earth, to contain a\nsingle grain of the medicine.\nWhile, according to Braid, the action of homoeopathic remedies was a\npurely subjective one, he also thought that the mental element associated\nwith the administration of drugs in general had been far too much ignored,\nand said, \" It is worthy of inquiry how much of the benefits derived during\nordinary treatment may be due entirely to the effects of the medicine, and\nhow much indirectly by its directing attention to, or withdrawing it from the\nseat of morbid action. ... A mental impression is necessarily brought\ninto operation whenever any substance is taken, supposed to be of a medical\nquality, and it will either excite or depress the functions of the morbid part\n[to or from which the mind is naturally directed] according to circumstances,\nindependently of the mere physical influence which would otherwise ensue\nfrom the particular medicine, supposing the patient had not been aware\nhe had taken any medical substance.\" This mental impression, Braid\nthought, accounted for the remarkable revolutions which have taken place\nat different times as to the estimate of the virtues and powers of particular\nmedicines. \"At one period a universal favourite appeared to be possessed\nof every valuable quality ; anon, discarded and forgotten as utterly worthless ;\nagain, arising into meridian power and splendour, to be followed by another\ndecadence in due course. All this arises very naturally in the following\nmanner. A zealous and sanguine professor prescribes it with high confidence\nof its potency for good, and patients, who are generally acute physiognomists\nas regards their medical attendants, catch the inspiration and the results are\nmost propitious. Every successful result exalts the confidence of the\nphysician and patient ; and others, prescribing with confidence, realise\nequally favourable results, and thus the remedy attains the culminating\npoint of its fame and favour. Others, however, follow in their wake, but\nneither with the same hopes nor desire that they should find the discovery\nof some rival practitioner deserving such laudation. The patients discern\nthe doubtful omen portrayed in the words, looks and manner of the\nattendant ; the effects are correspondingly less salutary, and every\nsucceeding case makes a decadence in the reputation of the once fashionable\nand omnipotent remedy. Others espouse this view, and thus, through their\ncombined moral impressions, they subvert the natural tendency of the\nremedy, and prevent the good which should legitimately have attached to it,\nindependently of either enthusiasm, or envy or caprice. It thus slumbers\nfor a time in forgetfulness, to give place to another rival, which is now in\nthe ascendant, until some other zealous patron at length takes the former\n\fsupplement.] James Braid; his Work and Writings. 147\nunder his special favour, and by a similar process as at first, it once more\nrises to the highest honours, but only to sink again, in its turn, to\nunmerited neglect.\"\nClairvoyance, etc.\nIn Braid's opinion, much of the reluctance to accept the genuine\nphenomena of mesmerism and hypnotism arose from the extravagant\nassertions of the mesmerists in reference to clairvoyance\u2014assertions which\nhe described as being opposed to all the known laws of physical science\nand a mockery of the human understanding. As the result of frequent\nexperiments made, not only on his own patients, but also upon many of the\nrenowned clairvoyants of the day, Braid was able to find nothing but\nhypnotic exaggeration of natural powers. The following sources of error,\nhe said, ought always to be kept in mind :\u20141. The hyperaesthesia of the\norgans of special sense, which enables impressions to be perceived through\nthe ordinary media that would pass unrecognised in the waking condition.\n2. The docility and sympathy of the subjects, which tend to make them\nimitate the actions of others. 3. The extraordinary revival of memory by\nwhich they can recall things long forgotten in the waking state. 4. The\nremarkable effect of contact in arousing memory. 5. The condition of\ndouble consciousness or double personality. 6. The vivid state of the\nimagination, which instantly invests every suggested idea, or remembrance\nof past impressions, with the attributes of present realities. 7. The\ntendency of the human mind, in those with a great love of the marvellous,\nto erroneously interpret the subject's replies in accordance with their own\ndesires. 8. Deductions rapidly drawn by the subject from unintentional\nsuggestions given by the operator. Braid considered that the belief in\nthought-transference arose from the failure to guard against sources of error\nsimilar to those just described, and stated that he had never met with any\ncase where the subjects could correctly interpret his unexpressed desires,\nwithout some sensible indication of them. In reference to the alleged\nintuitive powers of certain mesmeric subjects, Braid held that, whereas\nwith animals instinct was usually right, with somnambules it was generally\nwrong. It was true that certain patients could successfully predict their\nown hysterical attacks, but here the prophecy produced its own fulfilment\nthrough self-suggestion.\nPhrenology.\nBraid's increased knowledge of the power of mental influences in\nprovoking the various phenomena of the hypnotic state soon led him to\ndiscard even the slightest belief in phrenological phenomena. He complained\nthat the author of an article in the North British Review for November,\n1854, confounded him with the Phreno-Mesmerists and attributed to him\nthe belief that touching particular parts of the head would make a hypnotised\npatient laugh, pray, sing, steal, and fight, etc. \"Now,\" said Braid, \"the\nfact is that I never adduced the said manifestations as a proof of the\norganology of phrenology. I exhibited the phenomena and explained how\nthey were to be accounted for upon totally different principles, so that they\nneither proved nor disproved the doctrine of phrenology, but left that\nprecisely where they found it. These manifestations may arise either from\nL 2\n\f148 [Supplement.\nDr. J. Milne Bramwell.\na previous knowledge of phrenology, or from a system of training during\nthe sleep, so that they may come out subsequently as acts of memory,\nwhen corresponding points are touched, with which particular ideas have\nbeen associated through audible suggestion\u2014which arbitrary association\nmay be equally readily established by touching other parts of the body as by\ntouching different parts of the head\u2014or they may arise from the touch\ncalling into action certain muscles of expression of mental conditions,\nexciting in the mind of the subject the ideas with which they were usually\nassociated in the waking condition. This latter mode I consider the only\nnatural mode of exciting these manifestations, and it is a mere inversion\nof the sequence which ordinarily obtains between mental and muscular\nexcitation ; viz. , firstly, the touch calls into play the muscles constituting the\n' Anatomy of expression ' of any given passion or emotion, idea or train of\nthought ; and, secondly, this physical expression suggests or excites in the\nmind of the subject the corresponding idea, passion or emotion with which\nit is usually associated in the waking condition ; i.e. under ordinary\ncircumstances, the mental impression precedes and acts as the exciting\ncause of physical manifestations of different mental conditions, but here the\nphysical condition precedes and acts as the exciting cause of the mental\ncondition. . . . It is well known, however, that so long ago as\nDecember, 1841, I particularly pointed out the remarkable docility of\npatients during hypnosis, which made them most anxious to comply with\nevery proper request or supposed wish of others. I have, therefore, no\ndoubt that they might be trained to manifest, during hypnotism, the\nopposite tendencies, in accordance with conventional arrangements.\"\nAs early as 1843, Braid had adopted the view that the supposed phreno\nlogical manifestations were due to muscular expression exciting corresponding\nmental conditions, and in 1844 he showed that he was able to induce all the\nphenomena by verbal suggestion, no matter what part of the head was\ntouched.\nSuggestion, Passes, etc.\nAt first Braid employed mechanical methods alone, both for the\ninduction of hypnosis and its phenomena. But when he abandoned his\nphysical theory, his views as to the value of passes, etc. , naturally changed,\nand he soon regarded them as only of secondary importance, and attached\nmost value to suggestion. With certain impressionable subjects, hypnosis\nmight be caused by self-suggestion ; if they believed that something was taking\nplace at a distance, capable of putting them to sleep, they would fall asleep\neven if nothing was happening. Direct verbal suggestion, however, was\nbest both for the production of hypnotic phenomena and for the cure of\ndisease. After hypnotising his patients, Braid stated in a confident manner\nthe results he wished to obtain and, in certain subjects, found that these\ncould be varied by simple change in the voice. Thus, if he made a patient\nsee an imaginary sheep, and then asked him in a cheerful manner what\ncolour it was, this tone usually elicited the reply \"White,\" or some light\ncolour. If he then asked \"What colour is it now?\" giving a sad intonation\nto the word now, the reply would usually be \" Black.\"\nThe action of passes, etc., is explained by Braid in the following manner.\nEverything which produces a new impression will modify or change existing\n\fSupplement.] James Braid; his Work and Writings. 149\nfunctions, whether the new impression be of a mental or physical nature.\nThe brain receives many impressions, which subsequently influence the\nmind, although they were not perceived when conveyed to it by the organs\nof sense ; and others, too slight ever to become conscious, may nevertheless\nbe sufficient to produce a local influence on the nerves and capillaries.\nThus, a person may be engaged in reading, so as not to notice he is sitting\nin a draught, and yet this may cause rheumatism. Passes may have a\nmechanical action through the agitation of the air, or by touch, or they may\nproduce changes in temperature and electrical states. They are most\npowerful, however, when they directly excite mental action, either by fixing\nthe attention on one part or function of the body and withdrawing it from\nothers, or by arousing ideas previously associated with the physical\nimpression. All these effects may be neutralised by direct suggestion, and\nit is quite possible, by a system of training, to make passes, etc. , produce\nthe opposite of the result attributed to them. Thus, \" supposing that, with\neach touch or agitation of the air the operator speaks aloud and predicts what\nshall happen, the auricular suggestion maybe so strong as to cause thepredicted\nmanifestation to be realised instead of what otherwise would have been the\ncase ; and thus, from this time forward, through the double conscious\nmemory, the like impression on that part or organ of sense will recall the\npreviously associated idea and manifestations.\" Some sort of material\ncombination may be sufficient to produce hypnosis when it is positively\naffirmed that it will do so, while a moment later the same method will\nproduce nothing, when it is suggested it will be a failure. \"All these\nphenomena may be realised without the patient intending to play off any\ndeception on others, or having any remembrance of the fact on coming out\nof the sleep.\" Braid also stated that the entire value of passes and various\nother mechanical methods, was altogether a suggestive one and that he used\nthem just as he would use audible suggestion.\nDangers.\nIn passing into the hypnotic state, Braid held that reason and will were\nthe first mental powers to wane ; thus the imagination gained the ascendancy,\nand the cerebro-spinal functions became more excitable, as the controlling\npowers of the will were withdrawn. This interference with the volition,\nhowever, had its limits, and in an unpublished letter in my possession, in\nwhich he replied to some questions regarding the dangers of hypnotism,\nBraid stated \"that the Almighty would never have delegated to man such a\ndangerous influence over his fellow-man as to have given him such\nirresistible power over his volition. . . . While under the hypnotic\ninfluence, the patients evince great docility, but there is, however, such a\nstate of the perceptive faculties and judgment that they will be quite as\nfastidious of correct conduct as when in the natural state. So far as I know,\nthere is no more, or not so much, chance of gaining a knowledge of the\nthoughts of others than might be attained by giving the patient a glass or\ntwo of wine. And I have no experience of any such irresistible influence\nover individuals for producing those malign effects you refer to. I\nstrongly suspect they only exist in the imagination of the parties operating\nor operated on. At all events, no such effects result from my operations,\n\f150 [Supplement.\nDr. J. Milne BramweU.\nalthough undoubtedly I have been able to produce the most wonderful\neffects in many instances where ordinary treatment had been unavailing.\"\nBraid also asserted that he could give instructions to those who had been\nsuccessfully hypnotised, no matter how often, by means of which they\ncould completely resist the influence of any one afterwards.\nIn 1847, Braid contrasted the dangers of ether with those of hypnotism,\nfrom a moral point of view, and concluded in favour of hypnotism. He\nreferred to the moral abuse to which ethereal narcotism is capable of being\nturned by cruel and unprincipled individuals. The opponents of mesmerism\nand hypnotism had asserted that their employment was calculated to excite\nthe animal passions and that virtuous women might be victimised by\nunprincipled men, even without their consciousness of the fact when\nrestored to the waking state, or their possessing any mode of bringing home\nto the culprits a charge of their villainy, while there was not a whisper\nagainst the use of ether as liable to be converted to such unholy purposes.\nBraid's experience of both ether and hypnotism enabled him to confidently\nstate that ether was much the more dangerous of the two. He had never\nseen a hypnotised patient who did not strenuously resist any attempt at\ntaking a liberty with her. Such patients could not be induced to take off\ntheir stockings, for example, or to give a kiss to a gentleman, even should\nhe be a hallucinatory one. On the contrary, they would repel such\nsuggestions with more energy than in the waking condition, \" What might\nbe achieved,\" he said, \" by systematic and persevering attempts to corrupt\na virtuous person during that state, I do not pretend to tell ; I should never\ncondescend to witness such attempts being systematically made ; but my\npresent convictions are that the same individual might be more readily\ndemoralised when awake, than when in the second conscious state of\nnervous sleep, which evidently has a tendency with virtuous people to\nquicken their perceptions and heighten their notions of what would be\nimmoral or highly indecorous, whilst at the same time it renders them\nmost docile and obliging in all which is reasonable and seemly in their\nestimation. Thus, while they still indignantly repel the proposal to kiss an\nimaginary gentleman, they will be quite willing to do so to an imaginary\nchild. A libidinous manifestation I have never seen during hypnotism, but\nI have witnessed the most intense manifestations of erotism arise\nspontaneously on several occasions during the primary or exciting state of\netherisation, and that even in a patient of high respectability and of the\nmost modest and virtuous conduct and pious disposition in her general\ndeportment when awake.\"\nAgain, he said, supposing an unprincipled person were placed in the\nmost favourable circumstances for perpetrating a hypnotic crime and\nsucceeded, after systematic and persevering attempts, in doing so, and that,\non awaking, the patient had no remembrance whatever of the injury\ninflicted on her,\u2014\" let not the criminal indulge in a delusive hope that he\ncould not possibly be inculpated. From the well-established and most\nbeneficent law of double consciousness, it is quite certain that, however\ncompletely the transactions which occurred during the sleep may be\nforgotten on awaking, she has only to be hypnotised or mesmerised when\nout into the witness box, to render her as competent to give accurate\n\fSupplement.] James Braid; his Work and Writings. 151\ntestimony of all which occurred in her former state of nervous sleep, as in\nthe waking state she could testify to the facts which occurred in her waking\ncondition. Now, I maintain there is not a like security for the person who\nmight be victimised during ethereal narcotism. By this means patients\nmight be rendered speedily entirely oblivious of what was occurring, and that\nwithout the benefit and security of the double-conscious memory to be\nsummoned to the conviction of the perpetrators of their wrongs. \" . . .\n\"I have proved by experiments, both in public and private, that during the\nstate of excitement the judgment is sufficiently active to make the patient,\nif possible, even more fastidious, as regards the propriety of conduct, than\nin the waking condition ; and from the state of rigidity and sensibility, they\ncan be aroused to a state of mobility, and exalted sensibility, either by being\nrudely handled, or even by a breath of air. Nor is it requisite that it should\nbe done by the person who put them in the hypnotic state. It will follow\nequally from the manipulations of any one else, or a current of cold air\nimpinging against the body, or from any mechanical contrivance whatever.\nAnd, finally, the state cannot be induced, in any stage, unless with the\nknowledge and consent of the party operated on. In this, hypnotism has\nan advantage over medicine, for many powerful medicines have been used\nfor criminal purposes and can be administered without the knowledge of\nthe intended victim. I have vindicated hypnotism against the erroneous\nprejudices cited against it as having an immoral tendency ; I did not, and do\nnot, claim for it the power of emplanting a principle. I do not say it\nwill make a vicious person virtuous ; but I am most confident it will not\nmake a virtuous person vicious. On the contrary, I feel assured that a\nperson of habitually correct feelings will, during the somnambulistic\ncondition, while consciousness lasts, manifest fully as much delicacy and\ncircumspection of conduct as in the waking state. Moreover, I have proved\nthat no one can be affected at all unless by voluntary compliance, and\nconsequently it has no right to be held as an agency which could be\nconverted to immoral purposes, as many have supposed. If any one would\nsay it may have this tendency, because in a state of torpor, insensibility, and\ncataleptiform rigidity, the party is unconscious, immovable, and incapable\nof self-defence, I beg to remind such individuals that the same argument\nmight be urged against the proper use of wine, spirits, or opium, because\nexcess in the use of either might be followed by like results. I am quite\ncertain no one can be affected by it, in any stage of the process, unless by\nthe free will and consent of the patient, which is at once sufficient to\nexonerate the practice from the imputations of being capable of being\nconverted to immoral purposes, which has been so much insisted on to the\nprejudice of animal magnetism. This has arisen from the mesmerisers\nasserting that they have the power of overmastering patients irresistibly,\neven whilst at a distance, by mere volitions and secret passes.\" Braid\nstated that he had been careful in hypnotic experiments and had neither\nmet with accidents, nor seen a single case which he could not awaken in\ntwo minutes.\nMedical and Surgical Cases.\nBraid records a good many minor surgical operations, performed\npainlessly during hypnosis. He mentions the fact that in some instances\n\f152 [Supplement.\nDr. J. Milne Bramwett.\ngeneral consciousness was unimpaired, and the patients remembered\nafterwards all that had been done, although they had experienced no pain\nduring or after the operation. He also records an immense number of\nmedical cases which were cured or relieved by hypnotism. The majority of\nthese were functional nervous disorders, but remarkable results were also\nobtained in many cases of organic disease. The clearing up of a long\nstanding corneal opacity, in a patient who was being hypnotised for the\nrelief of a rheumatic affection, is one of the most interesting. He also\nobtained marked improvement in many cases of organic paralysis. In one\ninstance, the patient afterwards died from another apopletic seizure, and\npost-mortem examination revealed evidence of the earlier organic mischief. In\nthis case, the symptoms had improved greatly under hypnotic treatment. \"It\nis of importance beforehand to inform the patient,\" he said, \"that it is not\nnecessary for him to become unconscious in order to obtain the beneficial\neffects of the nervous sleep. Many believe that a favourable result can only\nbe obtained if the consciousness has been completely lost, whereas, in\nnumerous cases, where the usual internal and external treatment has been\nquite in vain, the most favourable results have been obtained by the impres\nsion on the nervous system, even if the patient has noticed everything that\nhas taken place and upon awaking from the nervous sleep has remembered\neverything which occurred during its duration.\" Braid stated he had ex\nperienced this himself, when, on account of a severe attack of rheumatism,\nhe had hypnotised himself for eight or nine minutes and awoke completely\nfree from pain, although he had not lost consciousness in the least during\nthe so-called sleep.\nGeneral Observations.\nBraid desired to place all his results and methods before his medical\nbrethren ; insisted that they alone ought to use hypnotism, and warned the\nignorant against tampering with such a powerful agency, which might\nproduce either good or evil according to the manner in which it was\nmanaged and applied. \"Hypnotism is capable,\" he said, \" of curing many\ndiseases for which hitherto we knew of no remedy ; but none but a\nprofessional man, well versed in anatomy, physiology and pathology, is\ncompetent to apply it with general advantage to the patient, or credit to\nhimself, or the agency he employs. I must beg, however, that it be\nparticularly understood that I by no means hold up this agency as a universal\nremedy. Whoever talks of a universal remedy, I consider must either be a\nfool or a knave ; for, as diseases arise from totally opposite pathological\nconditions, all rational treatment ought to be varied accordingly.\" In\nreference to the successful therapeutic results that he had obtained by\nhypnotism, Braid asserted that he could teach any intelligent medical man\nto do what he had done, and that his object had always been not to mystify,\nbut to dispel all mystery. He also claimed that he was able to hypnotise\na larger percentage by his mechanical methods, than the mesmerisers could\ndo with the supposed aid of mysterious agencies. Hypnotism could be\napplied with the greatest confidence by those who understood it, and benefit\nmight be derived from it, even in incurable cases ; neither pain, discomfort,\nnor dangers being associated with it. In doubtful cases, it was sometimes\nof service in obtaining a correct diagnosis.\n\fSupplement.] James Braid; Ids Work and Writings. 153\nBraid stated that he had taken every care to avoid deception in his\nexperiments, but did not expect, on this account, that his conclusions\nwould be accepted by others. He hoped, however, that his professional\nbrethren would investigate the subject coolly, with an honest desire to\narrive at truth. \"Having myself been sceptical,\" he said, \"I can make\nevery reasonable allowance for others. Every one should examine the\nphenomena for themselves, but at the same time they should know\nsomething about them.\" In illustration of the importance of this, he\nreferred to the fact that different subjects showed varying susceptibility\nand that many people, even professional men, expected that all should\npresent uniform hypnotic phenomena. \"It must be borne in mind,\" he\nsaid, ' ' that the opposite mental conditions may glide into each other by the\nmost imperceptible degrees, or by the most abrupt transitions, according to\nthe modes of management ; and thus consciousness or unconsciousness, sound\nsleep, dreaming, or somnambulism, will result, according as sensations or\nideas predominate, or are equally vivid. It is no unusual thing for\ndifferent parties to be testing, or calling for tests, for the opposite\nconditions, at the same instant of time.\"\nIn many instances, Braid published the written testimony of others in\nsupport of his alleged successful treatment of different patients by hypnotism,\nand explained that he did this because \" most unwarrantable interferences\nhad been resorted to by several medical men, in order to misrepresent some\nof them. In one instance, in order to obtain an attested erroneous\ndocument, the case was read to the patient, and others present, the very\nreverse of what was written. However extraordinary such conduct may\nappear, the fact of its occurrence was publicly proved, and borne testi\nmony to by the patient and other parties present on the occasion when the\ndocument was obtained.\"\nHe referred again and again to the almost incredible opposition which\nhe had to combat, at the hands both of the orthodox medical practitioner\nand of the mesmerist, and complained that having been attacked in the\nZoist, the editors of that journal would not permit him to reply in their\npages. He sent his answer to the Association Medical Journal, as he\nconsidered that the most natural medium for a member of the Provincial\nAssociation to publish his defence in, but it was also refused there.\n\" Throughout the whole of my inquiries,\" he said, \" my chief desire has\nbeen to arrive at what could be rendered most practically useful for the\nrelief and cure of disease ; and I hesitate not to say that, in the hands of a\nskilful medical man, who thoroughly understands the peculiar modes which\nI have devised for varying the effects in a manner applicable to different\ncases, hypnotism, besides being the speediest method for inducing the\ncondition is, moreover, capable of achieving all the good to be attained by\nthe ordinary mesmerising processes and much more.\" . . . \"Of course\nthere is one point which renders hypnotism less an object of approbation\nwith a certain class of society, viz., that I lay no claim for it to produce\nthe marvellous or transcendental phenomena ; nor do I believe that the\nphenomena manifested have any relation to a magnetic temperament, or\nsome peculiar or occult power, possessed in an extraordinary degree by the\noperator. These are all circumstances which appeal powerfully to the feelings\n\f154 [Supplement.\nBr. J. Milne Bramtvell.\nof the lovers of the marvellous, and therefore tell in favour of mesmerism ;\nand, moreover, seeing that, for conducting the hypnotic processes with any\ndegree of certainty and success, I contend that, in many cases, a knowledge\nof anatomy, physiology, pathology, and therapeutics are all requisite, it is\nobvious that such requirements must be less calculated to secure the\napprobation of iwn-professional mesmerists and amateurs, whose magnetic\ncreed taught them to believe that the mere possession by them of the\nmagnetic temperament,-\u2014of a surcharge by nature, within their own bodies,\nof a magnetic fluid or odyle,\u2014is quite sufficient to enable them to treat any\ncase as efficiently as the most skilful medical man in the universe, simply\nby walking up to the patient with the will and good intention of doing him\nservice, or by adding thereto, occasionally, the efficacy of mesmeric touches,\npasses or manipulations.\" . . . \" Like the originators of all new views,\nhowever, hypnotism has subjected me to much contention ; for the sceptics,\nfrom not perceiving the difference between my method and that of the\nmesmerists, and the limited extent of my pretensions, were equally hostile\nto hypnotism as they had been to mesmerism ; and the mesmerists, thinking\ntheir craft was in danger\u2014that their mystical idol was threatening to be\nshorn of some of its glory by the advent of a new rival\u2014buckled on their\narmour, and soon proved that the odium mesmericnm was as inveterate as\nthe odium theologicum.\"\nHistorical.\nBraid died suddenly on March 25th, 1860, according to some accounts\nfrom apoplexy, according to others from heart disease ; he left a widow, son\nand daughter. He maintained his active interest in hypnotism up to the end,\nand three days before his death sent his last MS. to Dr. Azam, with the\nfollowing inscription :\u2014' ' Presented to M. Azam, as a mark of esteem and\nregard, by James Braid, Surgeon, Manchester, March 22nd, 1860.\"\nSympathetic notices of Braid's death appeared in the local papers and\ndifferent medical journals, all of which bore warm testimony to his\nprofessional skill and high personal character. The Lancet drew attention\nto the fact that, though he was best known in the medical world by his\ntheory and practice of hypnotism, he had also obtained wonderfully\nsuccessful results by operations in cases of club foot and other deformities^\nwhich brought him patients from every part of the kingdom. Up to 1841 he\nhad operated on 262 cases of Talipes, 700 cases of Strabismus, and 23 cases\nof spinal curvature.\nIn 1852, in the Preface to the Third Edition of \" Magic, Witchcraft,\netc.,\" Braid stated that he now gave his view of all important hypnotic and\nmesmeric theories, and hoped, by this means, to make up in some measure\nfor the delay in the publication of another edition of his work on\nHypnotism, which had long been out of print, and was frequently called\nfor. \"That call,\" he said, \"I hope shortly to be able to respond to, with\nsuch fulness of detail as the importance of the subject merits ; more\nparticularly with regard to its practical application for the relief and cure\nof some forms of disease, of which numerous interesting examples will be\nadduced.\" At the conclusion of \" The Physiology of Fascination, etc.,\" he\nalso said :\u2014\"It is my intention shortly to publish a volume entitled,\n' Psycho-Physiology ; embracing Hypnotism, Monoideism and Mesmerism. '\n\fsupplement.] James Braid; his Work and Writings. 155\nThis work will comprise, in a connected and condensed form, the results of\nthe whole of my researches in this department of science ; and it will, more\nover, be illustrated by cases in which hypnotism has been proved particularly\nefficacious in the relief and cure of disease, with special directions how to\nregulate the processes so as to adapt them to different cases and\ncircumstances.\" Shortly before his death, Braid contemplating publishing a\nsecond edition of \" Neurypnology,\" in France ; this was never done, nor\ndid the two proposed works above referred to ever see the light. All\nBraid's books and articles are out of print, and of the former, Nos. 2, 3, 4,\n6, and 7 (See list, pp. 127 and 128), are alone to be found in the Library\nof the British Museum. I possess Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8, as well as most\nof his articles and two long MS. letters addressed to M. Highfield, Esq.,\nSurgeon, dated respectively 28th October, and 16th November, 1842.\nThese letters contain an interesting resume of Braid's views on the\nsubjective nature of hypnotic phenomena ; some account of the hyperaesthesia\nof the special senses and reference to successful medical cases, together with\nthe denial of the alleged dangers of hypnotism and of the supposed automa\ntism of the subject.\nIn 1859, Dr. Azam, of Bordeaux, became acquainted with Braid's\nhypnotic work, and commenced to investigate the subject for himself ; an\naccount of his experiments, with much reference to Braid, appeared in\nthe Archives de Medecine in 1860. About the same time Broca, who had\nobtained marvellous results with Braid's methods, read a paper on Hypnotism\nbefore the Academie des Sciences, which attracted much attention, and\nVelpeau presented a copy of \" Neurypnology \" to the same Society. A\ncommission, composed of members of the four sections of the Institute, was\nthen formed to report on the subject. On hearing of this, Braid wrote to\nthe Academie to say how much pleasure Azam's brilliant results, and the\naction of the Society, had given him.\nProm this date, the subject of hypnotism was never lost sight of in\nFrance ; but it was not until 40 years after its original publication that\n\"Neurypnology\" was translated by Dr. Jules Simon, who stated that\n\"Braid's researches procured for him numerous enemies ; but despite this he\npursued them with the precision of genius, and was able to add artificial\nsomnambulism to the pathology of the nervous system\u2014a chapter which\nthe investigations of the greater number of modern neuro-pathologists have\nconfirmed.\"\nBraid's first translator was W. Preyer, Professor of Physiology at the\nUniversity of Jena, who in 1881 published \"The Discovery of Hypnotism.\"\nThis was a condensation of \"Neurypnology,\" together with the translation\nof the pamphlet sent by Braid to Azam in 1860, which had passed into the\npossession of Dr. Beard of New York, who lent it to Preyer. The same\npamphlet is also translated into French and forms an appendix to Dr. Jules\nSimon's \"Neurypnology,\" published in 1883. In 1882, Preyer published\n\" Hypnotism,\" which consisted of a translation of all Braid's works, with the\nexception of \"Neurypnology,\" and \"Satanic Agency.\"\nI do not propose in this article to examine Braid's views critically, but\ndesire briefly to compare them with those of later workers in the same field.\n\fDr. J. Milne Bramwell. [Supplement.\nAt first Braid believed in the purely physical origin of hypnotic\nphenomena, and held that they could be induced by mechanical means in\nsubjects who were ignorant of hypnotism or mesmerism. This doctrine is\nstill held by Heidenhain and by certain members of the Salpetriere School.\nThe former says :\u2014\"People who have heard nothing about hypnotism, and\nwho do not know for what purpose they are being experimented on, can be\nhypnotised. The hypnotic condition can be brought about without the\ninstrumentality of a living being, simply by certain definite physical\nstimuli.\" Charcot and Gilles de la Tourette say, \"Hypnotism c;.n be\ninduced by purely physical means, and a person can be hypnotised, so to\nspeak, unknown to himself.\" Before Braid appreciated the mental influence\nin hypnosis, he was inclined to believe in phrenology, and the same cause\nseems to have led the Salpetriere School into error as to the action of\nmagnets, metals and medicines in sealed tubes. That all these owed their\nvirtue to suggestion was clearly demonstrated by Braid ; yet, despite this\nfact, the metallo-therapeutics of Burq were revived by Charcot and his\ndisciples, and Dr. Luys still plays with his india-rubber dolls and Professor\nBenedikt with his magnets. An account, by Dr. F. Peterson and others, of\nProfessor Benedikt's theory of the action of magnets, and of the experimental\nexposure of its fallacious nature, read before the New fork Academy of\nMedicine, closely resembles what was said and done by Braid on the same\nsubject. According to Professor Benedikt, \"certain forms of hysteria are\nbetter treated by the magnet than by electricity, hydropathy or drugs.\nWhen a magnet is applied to the sensitive vertebrae without removal of the\ndress, the irritable patient soon becomes quiet and even quasi paralysed,\nthe muscles gradually relax, the respiration becomes sighing, consciousness\nslowly disappears ; the resistance to conduction in motor nerves could easily\nbecome absolute. The two poles have different effects, the magnet must be\nemployed with caution, patients may be injured by it.\" These statements\nwere tested in America ; magnets of enormous power were used and experi\nments made on human subjects and lower animals. A young dog was\nsubjected to magnetic influence for five hours ; but, instead of being\nparalysed from \"increased resistance to conduction in motor nerves,\" on\nbeing liberated, it was more lively than before. The experimenters conclude\n\"that the human organism is in no wise appreciably affected by the most\npowerful magnets known to modern science ; that neither direct nor reversed\nmagnetism exerts any perceptible influence upon the iron contained in the\nblood, upon the circulation, upon ciliary or protoplasmic movements, upon\nsensory or motor nerves, or upon the brain. The ordinary magnets used\nin medicine,\" they say, \"have a purely suggestive or psychic effect, and\nwould in all probability be quite as useful if made of wood.\"\nThe theories of the School of Nancy closely resemble Braid's later ones,\nin which he regarded hypnotic phenomena from a psychical standpoint.\nThey are not alike, however, on all points. For, while both attach much\nimportance to \"dominant ideas\" and \"suggestion,\" Braid regards the\nlatter simply as a method of inducing the phenomena, and lays stress on the\npreliminary change which must be brought about in the nervous system,\nwhile the Nancy School hold that suggestion explains all the phenomena of\nhypnosis. Bernheim, for example, considers that there is nothing in\n\fSupplement.] James Braid; his Work and Writings. 157\nhypnotism but the name, and says, \"hypnotism does not really create a\nnew condition ; there is nothing in induced sleep which may not occur in\nthe waking condition.\" In this Mr. Frederic Myers agrees with Braid,\nand has clearly pointed out that suggestion does not explain the phenomena\nof hypnosis, but is merely the artifice used by the operator in order to evoke\nthem.\nBraid is in opposition to the Nancy School in reference to suggested\ncrimes and to what has been called the automatism of the hypnotised\nsubject. On this point he is more in accordance with the Salpetriere School\nand his position has recently been greatly strengthened by the observations\nof Delboeuf and others. With regard to this question, Mr. Frederic\nMyers says, \" Let us first observe what is the moral tone of the somnambule\nwhen left to himself, as far as possible, without suggestion. In some\nimportant points it is the precise opposite of the drunken condition.\nAlcohol, apparently by paralysing first the higher inhibitory centres, makes\nmen boastful, impure, and quarrelsome. Hypnotism, apparently by a tendency\nto paralyse lower appetitive centres, produces a contrary effect. The\nincreased refinement and increased cheerfulness of the developed somnam\nbule is constantly noticed. It is a moot point whether any sleep-walker\nhas ever told an untruth ; and, so far as I know, no angry or impure\ngesture has ever shown itself spontaneously in the hypnotic state. \"\nMy own observations on this question have led me to conclusions even\nmore pronounced than Braid's. For while I am convinced that it is impossible\nto commit or suggest crime during the alert stage of hypnosis, nothing that\nI have seen has afforded me any ground for supposing that a crime could be\ncommitted during the deep stage. As early as 1890, in an account of some\ndental operations, performed during hypnotic anaesthesia, I drew attention\nto the fact that there was no interference with the volition of the subject.\nBraid, as we have seen, drew important distinctions between natural and\ninduced sleep. These are not recognised by the Nancy School. Bernheim\nsays, \"In my opinion nothing, absolutely nothing, differentiates natural\nand artificial sleep.\" He admits, however, one point of difference, namely,\nthat \" in ordinary sleep, as soon as consciousness is lost, the subject is only\nin relationship with himself. In induced sleep, the subject's mind retains\nthe memory of the person who has put him to sleep, whence the hypnotiser's\npower of playing upon his imagination, or of suggesting dreams, and of\ndirecting the acts which are no longer controlled by the weakened or absent\nwill. \" With regard to the relationship between hysteria and hypnotism,\nBraid agrees with the Nancy and is opposed to the Salpetriere School.\nBraid and the Nancy School differ in reference to rapport. According to\nCarpenter, who explained Braid's views in an article in the Quarterly\nReview, rapport could be entirely explained on the principle of \"dominant\nideas.\" The subject believed that the operator alone had power over him,\nor could commuuicate with him ; this established the rapport. Rapport\nwas not discovered until long after the practice of mesmerism had come into\nvogue, having been unknown to Mesmer and his immediate disciples ; and\nits phenomena only acquired constancy and fixity, in proportion as its laws\nwere announced and received. Mesmerists, ignorant of rapport, produced a\ngreat variety of remarkable phenomena, and yet never detected this rapport ;\n\f158 [Supplement.\nDr. J. Milne Bramivell.\nalthough they obtained immediate evidence of it, when once the idea had\nbeen put into their own minds and thence transferred to their subjects. In\nall the experiments Dr. Carpenter witnessed which seemed to indicate its\nexistence, the previous idea had either been present, or had obviously been\nsuggested by the methods employed to induce the mesmeric somnambulism ;\nwhilst in a large number of other cases, in which the subjects were not\nhabitues of the mesmeric seances, their consciousness was not confined to\nthe mesmeriser, or to those whom he placed en rapport with them, but was\nequally extended to all around.\nBraid, as we have already seen, observed that a somnambule, supposed\nonly to be en rapport with the hypnotiser, heard and obeyed the predictions\nmade by a third person. At a much later date, Liegeois drew attention to\nthe fact that when you had suggested to a somnambule that he could not\nhear you, he was still able to do so. \"If,\" he said, \"you address him\ndirectly, he will neither reply nor carry out your suggestion ; but if you speak\nimpersonally, speaking not in your own name, but as if with an internal\nvoice, then the subject will execute the suggestion. Under such circum\nstances, if I said in reference to Camille, ' Camille is thirsty, Camille will\ngo to the kitchen and ask for a glass of water,' the order was obeyed.\"\nThe following is Li\u00e9beault's view:\u2014\"It is observed that nearly all\nartificial somnambules are in relation by their senses with those who put\nthem to sleep, but only with them. The subject hears everything that the\noperator says to him, but him only, provided the sleep is sufficiently deep.\nHe only hears the operator when he is addressed directly by him and not\nwhen a third person is spoken to. This rapport extends to the other\nsenses.\" According to LWbeault, the subject remains en rapport with the\nhypnotiser because he goes to sleep in thinking of him, and this does not\ndiffer from what happens in ordinary sleep. A mother who goes to sleep\nclose to the cradle of her child, does not cease to watch over him during her\nsleep, but watches only for him, and while she hears his slightest cry is\ninsensible to other louder sounds. The concentration of the subject's\nattention upon the operator, and his mental retention of the idea of the one\nwho put him to sleep, is the cause of rapport.\nFrom this it is evident that Braid believed rapport to be entirely the\nresult of suggestion, while Li\u00e9beault considers it to be due to a concentration\nof attention which resulted naturally from the induction of hypnosis. My\nown observations have led me to conclusions similar to those of Braid. In\nsubjects who did not know what was expected of them, and to whom neither\ndirect nor indirect suggestions of rapport were made, this condition did not\nappear. On the contrary, they heard and obeyed any one who might address\nthem. In several instances, similar conditions were observed in the\nsubjects experimented on by the Hypnotic Committee of the Society for\nPsychical Research. These facts apparently disprove Bernheim's conclusion\nthat the only difference which exists between natural and induced sleep is\nthe concentration of the subject's mind upon the operator,\u2014a condition\nwhich, he holds, not only explains rapport, but also the power of the\noperator to influence the subject.\nIt is interesting to note that Braid, like Esdaile, recognised the analogy\nbetween hypnosis and certain states produced by Cannabis Indica. No\n\fSupplement.] \u2022James Braid; his Work and Writings. 159\nreference to these observations is to be found in Schrenck-Notzing's\nmonograph, \" Die Bedeutung narcotischer Mittel fur den Hypnotismus. \"\nHe refers, however, to O'Shaughnessy's experiments.\nSome slight difference exists between Braid's view of the value of\npasses, etc., and that of Professor Forel. While Braid believed that their\ninfluence was mainly suggestive, he still held that they were capable of\nproducing some physical effect, though this might be destroyed or reversed\nby direct suggestion. Forel, on the other hand, denies the physical\ninfluence of mechanical processes on the ground that suggestion is capable\nof altering their supposed action. He says, \"The action of blowing upon\nthe face no longer awakens my subjects, because I suggested this would\nremove pain, in place of awakening them. \" From this he argues that the\nact of blowing produces no result ; but would it not be equally logical to\ncontend that the prick of a pin produced no physical effect, because by\nsuggestion the patient, rendered insensible to pain, had been taught to\nregard the pin prick as the signal to evoke some other condition 1\nBraid forestalled Bernheim in discovering the value of hypnotic\ntreatment in organic paralysis and the power of the operator's touch to\nassist the patient's mental concentration and thus recall lost memory.\nBernheim says, \" If necessary, I lay my hand on the subject's forehead to\nconcentrate his attention ; he thinks deeply for an instant, without falling\nasleep, and all the latent memories arise with great precision.\" This, both\nas to the observed fact and its explanation, is an almost exact reproduction\nof the words of Braid. Bernheim's views, as to the part played by\nsuggestion in ordinary medicine, were long ago expressed by Braid clearly\nand at great length. Similar opinions have recently been advanced by\nDr. Wilks, the newly-elected President of the Royal College of Physicians,\nand one of the ablest thinkers in the medical profession. According to him,\n\" To sit down in one's chair daily and write on a piece of paper the name of\nsome drug for every ailment without exception which comes under our\nobservation is in the present state of medicine an absurdity, and simply a\npandering to human weakness. I do not say that drugs are not useful in a\nmoral sense, I am merely contending that the method is not scientific, as\nwe usually apply this term. I know of no more successful practitioner than\nthe late Sir William Gull, and his treatment was rational, but he did not\ncredit any particular drug with the properties ascribed to it by the patient.\nHis prescription very often consisted of nothing but coloured water.\"\nDr. Wilks describes a \" sixpenny doctor,\" at a cheap dispensary, who saw\non an average 70 patients during one evening, and whose almost universal\nmedicine was a mixture composed of sulphate of magnesia, burnt sugar and\ninfusion of quassia, and who said, \"Always give medicines which produce\nappreciable effects ; then also the mixture must taste like medicine, and if\nit have a bad smell, the patient will be better satisfied.\" Dr. Wilks objects\n\" to the attempt to treat cases of disease on principle, when we possess no\nprinciples ; we do not know sufficiently the action of drugs to do this, and\nwe know less of the meaning or significance of symptoms which we treat.'\nWith change of the pathological views of disease, he says, the whole method\nof its treatment is changed again and again, and further chemical knowledge\nfrequently shows that the drugs we employ do not possess the qualities we\n\f160 [Supplement,\nDr. J. Milne Bramivell.\nhave been in the habit of attributing to them. '' Medicine began as a\nsuperstition, covered and surmounted by fancies and crude theories. By\ngetting rid of these, advance has been made ; but the fact is not yet\nsufficiently realised that many of the old fancies still remain in the\nprofession.\"\nDr. Hack Tuke, in speaking of Sir Andrew Clark, said, '' His favourite\ndrugs were Bicarbonate of Potash and a vegetable bitter ; but neither drugs\nnor diet formed the central factors of his treatment, or explained his\nsuccess. ' Suggestion ' lay at the root of it all. The term, however, is.\ntoo mild, unless understood in the technical sense in which it has been\nemployed in recent times. In short, Sir Andrew out-Bernheimed Bern-\nheim ; he was, in a word, the most successful hypnotist of his day.\"\nIn reference to the many important differences between the theories of\nBraid and those just referred to, my own observations, I may state, accord\non most points with those of the earlier investigator. A careful study of\nall Braid's writings has led me to the conclusion that, while much has\nbeen lost by their neglect, little or no advance has been made upon\nthem until quite recent times. Where progress has been made, and\nmade alone, it has been in the development of the views already expressed\nby Braid as regards the individuality, in opposition to the automatism, of\nthe hypnotised subject, and in a clearer estimate of what he recognised as\ndouble-consciousness. Above everything, it is worthy of note how Braid at\nonce, by his early experiments, exploded the fallacies of the mesmerists,\nwhich, till then, had flourished successfully, despite the abusive and\nabsolutely unscientific attacks of the combined medical press. In the writings\nof Mr. Frederic Myers, more especially in \"The Subliminal Conscious\nness,\" are to be found the ablest and clearest expression of these later\nviews. In reference to hypnotism, he justly says, \"It is something more\nand other than the mere production of trance that we have to deal with\u2014\nsomething more and other than the mere phenomena of fascination,\nmimicry, rigidity, which are to be seen on every itinerant mesmeriser's\nplatform. Discussions on cerebral circulation, on inhibition and dynamo-\ngenesis, are useful and needful on the outskirts of the problem ; they may\ngive precision to our conception of the condition in which the deeper\nphenomena begin ; but they cannot explain the novel powers to which those\nphenomena introduce us,\u2014the increased, the penetrating control of the brain\nover the organism.\"\nHow is it that Braid's later theories have been almost entirely ignored ?\nThe answer is a difficult one. It is true that all his works have long been\nout of print in this country, and are not to be found in their entirety, even\nin the British Museum. On the other hand, his conclusions were largely\nadopted by the scientists of his day. In illustration of this, it is only\nnecessary to refer to the works of the late Drs. Carpenter and John Hughes-\nBennett. The former gives a full exposition of Braid's views in his\n\"Principles of Mental Physiology,\" Sixth Edition, London, 1881,\n\" Mesmerism, Spiritualism, etc.,\" and elsewhere. The following passage,\nfrom an article in the Quarterly Review for September, 1853, shows how\nthoroughly Dr. Carpenter understood the importance attached by Braid to*\nsuggestion. \"The clue to the marvel [mesmerism] was soon found by Mr.\n\fsupplement.] James Braid; his Work and Writings. 161\nBraid, in the concentrated operation of the principle of suggestion ; [the\nitalics are Dr. Carpenter's] . . . and under the guidance of this idea,\nhe has subsequently followed up the investigation with great intelligence,\nmaking no mystery of his proceedings, but courting investigation in every\npossible way.\" Professor Bennett, in his \"Textbook of Physiology,\"\nreproduced the explanation of \"Braidism,\" both from the physiological and\npsychological side, first given by him in 1851. This formed a part of the\nlecture on hypnotism he gave annually to his students, in which he urged\nthem to investigate a subject destined to revolutionise the theory and\npractice of medicine.\nThe only recent English writer, as far as I know, who refers to Braid's\nlater works, is C. W. Sutton in the \"Dictionary of National Biography,\"\nwhere he states that some of them have been translated into French and\nGerman. Despite Preyer's translations, Braid's advanced theories seem to\nbe little recognised in Germany and, as far as I have observed, Moll alone\nrefers to them, and in the Zeibschrift fiir Hypnotismus, for December,\n1892, he warmly acknowledges Germany's indebtedness to Preyer for his\ntranslations and states that the later works are a distinct advance upon\n\" Neurypnology,\" especially in their psychological explanation of hypnotic\nphenomena. At the same time, he evidently does not realise how entirely\nBraid had forestalled the \" Suggestion \" theory of the Nancy School. He\nadmits, however, that \" notwithstanding that many researchers have referred\nto and valued Braid's writings, the modern works are only in the smallest\ndegree a continuation of his.\"\nIn France, Braid's later theories are equally ignored, which is all the\nmore surprising when one remembers that a translation of his last MS. was\npublished in 1883 as a supplement to \"Neurypnology.\" This gives many\nof his advanced views, and clearly states his reasons for substituting them\nfor his earlier ones and for changing the term hypnotism into that of\nmonoideism. It also contains numerous references to verbal suggestion.\nBernheim refers to it, but has evidently entirely failed to grasp its importance,\nand merely says that he agrees with Brown-Sequard that Braid did not guard\nsufficiently against suggestion and that \" it seems that at the end of his life,\nBraid felt some doubt about his experiments relative to phreno-hypnotism.\nIn his last memoir, a remarkable resume of his work, addressed to the\nAcademy of Science in 1860, at the time of the experiments of Azam and\nBroca, he passes by his phreno-hypnotic researches in silence.\" Bernheim\nalso mentions Braid's work, \"The Power of the Mind over the Body,\" but\nonly in connection with Grimes' \"electro-biological researches.\"\nWhile I have tried to show, both as a point of historical interest and in\njustice to Braid, how he had anticipated many of the most important\nobservations of the School of Nancy, I do not wish to undervalue the\nservices of that School, and more especially those of its founder. Braid's\nresearches were undoubtedly the exciting cause of the hypnotic revival in\nFrance, but at that time little or nothing was known of any of his works,\nexcept \" Neurypnology,\" and his last MS. was not published in France until\n1883. To Lieheault we owe practically the entire development of modern\nhypnotism. Independently he arrived at the conclusion that the mental\nm\n\f162 [Supplement.\nDr. J. Milne Bramwell.\ncondition was the important one in hypnosis, and suggestion the main factor\nin producing its phenomena, and successfully combated the errors of the\nSalpetriere School. Another point in reference to their career is worthy of\nnote. Braid's views at once brought him fame. His books sold rapidly,\nthe demand for them exceeding his power of supply. The medical journals\nwere open to him, to an extent which may well excite envy in those\ninterested in the subject at the present day. When Li\u00e9beault published his\nclassical work, \" Du Sommeil et des Etats analogues,\" six copies alone were\nsold. His statements only found sceptics, his methods of treatment were\nrejected without examination, and he was laughed at and despised by all.\nFor many years he devoted himself entirely to the poor, and long refused to\naccept a fee, lest he should be regarded as attempting to make money by un\nrecognised methods. Even in his later days, fortune never came to him, and\nhis services\u2014services, which he himself, with true modesty, described as the\ncontribution of a single brick to the edifice many were trying to build\u2014only\nbegan to be appreciated when old age compelled him to retire from active\nwork. Though his researches have been recognised, it is certain that they\nhave not been estimated at their true value, and that members of a younger\ngeneration have reaped the reward which his devotion of a lifetime failed to\nobtain.\nReferences.\nIn the Medical Times ;\u2014\n1. \"The New Theory of Animal Magnetism.\" Vol. V., 1841-42, p. 175.\nEditorial account of a lecture given by Mr. Duncan, on Animal Magnetism,\nat the Hanover Square Rooms, on December 31st, 1841.

Myees.\nIt has been often explained in these Proceedings that the success or\notherwise of our investigations must necessarily depend largely upon the\namount of first-hand testimony which we receive from voluntary correspon\ndents. These correspondents are not all of them equally familiar with\nphilosophical and medical terms ; nor are they all of them of English-\nspeaking nationality. It is important, nevertheless, that they should readily\nand exactly understand the drift of our inquiries ; and we have been\nrepeatedly asked to furnish a Glossary of the unfamiliar words which those\ninquiries oblige us to use. I have here attempted to comply with that\nrequest, and have explained some words and phrases which fall under three\nmain heads.\n1. Words in common philosophical or medical use, to which no new\nshade of meaning is given in this inquiry, e.g. ecmnesia. Introducing a\nfew of these words for the ordinary reader's convenience, I have generally\ntaken the definition from Hack Tuke's Dictionary of Psychological Medicine\n(London : Churchill, 1892), which is the most authoritative\u2014almost the only\n\u2014English work of its kind.\n2. Words or phrases in themselves not new, but used in these studies\nwith some special significance ;\u2014as for instance \" systematised anaesthesia,\"\n\" negative hallucination.\" These two phrases are constantly used by French\nwriters on hypnotism ; but mere familiarity with the words themselves would\nnot explain their meaning in that context to a reader fresh to hypnotic\ndiscussions.\n3. A few words, distinguished by an asterisk, for which I am myself\nresponsible. I must leave it to my readers to judge how far these words are\n\fsupplement.] Glossary of Terms used in Psychical Research. 167\nlikely to be useful. But I would suggest that when a subject so novel as\nours is made the subject of discussion in many countries, there is a\nconvenience in using words of Greek or Latin derivation, which can be\nadapted to all languages, and can be made to bear a clearly defined\nsignification.\nGlossary.\nAboulia.\u2014 Loss of power of willing. I have used the word hyperboidia to\nexpress that increased power over the organism, resembling the power which\nwe call will when it is exercised over the voluntary muscles, which is seen\nin the bodily changes effected by self-suggestion.\nAfter-image.\u2014The picture seen as though in the eye itself after looking\nat a bright object. It is called positive when it reproduces, negative when it\nreverses the true illumination or colours of the actual object. After-images\nare regarded as retinal or entoptic, belonging to the interior of the eye.\nAfter-images must be distinguished from memory-images, which may appear\nspontaneously, or may be summoned by an effort of will, long after the\noriginal sight of the object.\nAgent.\u2014The person on whose condition a telepathic impression seems to\nbe dependent ; who seems to initiate the telepathic transmission.\nAlternation of personality.\u2014See Disintegration of personality.\nAnaesthesia, or the loss of sensation generally, must be distinguished\nfrom analgesia, or the loss of the sense of pain alone. Many hypnotic\nsubjects are analgesic but not anaesthetic. Systematised anasthesia or\nnegative hallucination signifies the condition of an entranced subject who has\nbeen told (for instance) that Mr. A. is not in the room, while he is in reality\npresent. The subject may thus be said to have a negative hallucination, or\nto have been deprived of a certain group or system of perceptions, in that\nhe fails to see Mr. A. Other words descriptive of the general sensory con\ndition are dysesthesia, impaired or painful sensation, paresthesia, erroneous\nor morbid sensation, hyperesthesia, unusually keen sensation, which may or\nmay not be a morbid symptom. Hyperaesthesia may be peripheral, when it\naffects nerve-endings near the surface of the body, or central, when the\nexcessive sensitiveness belongs to the central sensorium ;\u2014such parts,\nnamely, of the brain as are concerned in receiving or generating sensory\nimages and impressions. Hemi-anwsthesia means anaesthesia of half the\nbody, the median line (down the middle of the body) separating normal\nsensation from absence of sensation. Anaesthetic zones or patches (formerly\ndeemed characteristic of witches) are common in hysteria. Cenmsthesia\nmeans that consensus or agreement of many organic sensations which is a\nfundamental element in our conception of personal identity. Finally I have\nsuggested the word *pano?sthesia to express the undifferentiated sensory\ncapacity of the supposed primal germ.\nAphasia.\u2014Incapacity of coherent utterance, not caused by structural\nimpairment of the vocal organs, but by lesion of the cerebral centres for\nspeech. Distinguished from congenital or acquired aphonia, due to paralysis\nor imperfect approximation of the vocal cords, and also from hysterical\nmutism, when the patient is obstinately and involuntarily silent, although the\nvocal organs are uninjured and the cerebral centres of speech are only\n\f168 [Supplement.\nF. W. H. Myers.\nfunctionally affected, with no visible lesion. All the four forms of verbalisa\ntion are subject to separate disorders of the type of aphasia. Lack of power\nto write words is called agraphia or agraphy ; lack of power to understand\nwords written, alexia or word-blindness ; lack of power to understand words\nuttered, word-deafness. In each case the trouble may lie in the brain and not\nin the organ of sense or other organs. For instance, a man's sight even for\nprinted musical notes may be unimpaired, while yet he is unable to under\nstand printed words.\nAttaque de sommeil.\u2014This French term is more correct than the word\n\" trance,\" to express those spontaneous lapses into prolonged and profound\nsleep which sometimes occur in hysterical subjects.\nAutomatism.\u2014The words automatism and automatic are used in some\nwhat different senses by physiologists and psychologists. Thus Professor\nFoster says, (Foster's Physiology, 5th Edition, p. 920) \"We speak of an\naction of an organ or of a living body as being spontaneous or automatic\nwhen it appears to be not immediately due to any changes in the circum\nstances in which the organ or body is placed, but to be the result of changes\narising in the organ or body itself and determined by causes other than the\ninfluences of the circumstances of the moment. The most striking automatic\nactions of the living body [are] those which we attribute to the working of\nthe will and which we call voluntary or volitional.\" That is to say, to the\nphysiologist an action is \"self-moved\" when it is determined, not by the\nenvironment, but by the organism itself. The word thus becomes hardly\nmore than a synonym for spontaneous. The psychologist, on the other hand,\nregards an action as \" self-moved \" when it is determined in an organism\napart from the central will or control of that organism. Thus when an act\nat first needing voluntary guidance, by practice comes to need such guidance\nno longer, it is called \" secondarily automatic.\" 1 have used the word in a\nwider sense, as expressing such images as arise, as well as such movements\nas are made, without the initiation, and generally without the concurrence, of\nconscious thought and will. Sensory automatism will thus include visual and\nauditory hallucinations ; motor automatism will include messages written\nwithout intention (automatic script) or words uttered without intention (as in\n\" speaking with tongues,\" trance-utterances, etc.). I ascribe these processes\nto the action of submerged or subliminal elements in the man's being. Such\nphrases as \"reflex cerebral action,\" or \"unconscious cerebration,\" give\ntherefore, in my view, a very imperfect conception of the facts.\nCatalepsy.\u2014\" An intermittent neurosis, characterised by the patient's\ninability to change the position of a limb, while another person can place the\nmuscles in a state of flexion or contraction as he will.\"\u2014Tuke's Diet.\nCatalepsy may also be induced as a stage of hypnotism ; although Charcot's\nview which erected catalepsy, lethargy,somnambulism (their relative positions\nsometimes varied) into three typical or necessary stages in a hypnotic\ntrance is now commonly considered to have been a too hasty generalisation\nfrom the habits\u2014largely imitative\u2014of the group of hypnotic patients at the\nSalpetriere, (a hospital in Paris.)\nCensus of hallucinations.\u2014An inquiry undertaken to determine the\nfrequency of hallucinations in sane and healthy persons ; described in\nS.P.R. Proceedings, Vol. X.\n\fsupplement.] Glossary of Terms used in Psychical Research. 169\nCentre of consciousness.\u2014The place where a percipient imagines himself to\n\u25a0be. The point from which he seems to himself to be surveying some\nphantasmal scene.\nClairvoyance (Lucidite).\u2014The faculty or act of perceiving, as though\nvisually, with some coincidental truth, some distant scene, used sometimes,\nbut hardly properly, for transcendental vision, or the perception of beings\nregarded as on another plane of existence. Clairaudience is generally used\nof the sensation of hearing an internal (but in some way veridical) voice.\nI have preferred to use the term *telaisthesia for distant perception. For\nthe faculty has seldom any close analogy with an extension of sight ; the\nperception of distant scenes being often more or less symbolical and in other\n-ways out of accord with what actual sight would show in the locality of the\nvision. On the other hand, telcesthesia merges into telepathy, since we cannot\nsay how far the perception of a distant scene may in essential be the per\nception of the content of a distant mind.\nCoincidental.\u2014This word is used when there is some degree of coincidence\nin time of occurrence between a supernormal incident and an event at a\ndistance, which makes it seem probable that some causal connection exists\nbetween the two. An apparition, for instance, seen at or about the\nitime when the person whose phantasm is seen dies, is a coincidental\n.apparition.\nCollective.\u2014Applied to cases where several persons together perceive a\nhallucination or phantasm.\nControl.\u2014This word is used of the intelligence which purports to\ncommunicate messages which are written or uttered by the automatist,\njsensitive, or medium. The word is used for convenience' sake, but should not\nimply that the source of the messages need be other than the automatist's\nown subliminal intelligence.\n*Gosmopathic.\u2014Open to the access of supernormal knowledge or emotion,\napparently from the transcendental world, but whose precise source we have\nno means of defining.\nCrystal-gazing.\u2014The act of looking into a crystal, glass ball, or other\nspeculum, or reflecting surface, with the object of inducing hallucinatory\npictures. The person doing this is called a seer or scryer. The pictures of\ncourse exist in the mind \"and not in the crystal. See Shell-hearing.\nDelusion and Delusive.\u2014Applied generally to all cases whether of halluci\nnation or illusion, when there is no corresponding reality whatever ;\u2014i.e.,\nwhen the case is not coincidental or in any other way veridical.\n*Dextro-cerebral (opposed to *Sinistro-cerebral) ; of left-handed persons,\nas employing preferentially the right hemisphere of the brain.\nDimorphism.\u2014In crystals, the property of assuming two incompatible\nforms ; in plants and animals, difference of form between members of\nthe same species. Used of a condition of alternating personalities ; a\nkind of psychical dimorphism in which memory, character, faculty, etc.,\npresent themselves at different times in different forms in the same person.\nSimilarly, polymorphism is the property of assuming many forms.\nDiscarnate.\u2014Disembodied, opposed to incarnate. Used of that part of\nman which still subsists after bodily death.\n\f170 [Supplement.\nF. W. H. Myers.\nDisintegration ofpersonality.\u2014Used of any condition where the sense of\npersonality is not unitary and continuous ; especially when secondary and\ntransitory personalities intervene ; as for instance when a hysterical subject\ncalls herself at one time Rose, at another Adrienne, etc., with separate\nchains of memory for each condition.\nDissolutive.\u2014Opposed to Evolutive, of changes which tend not towards\nprogress but towards decay.\nDynamogeny.\u2014The increase of nervous energy by appropriate stimuli ;\noften opposed to inhibition.\nEcmnesia.\u2014A gap in memory : \" a form of amnesia [forgetfulness] in\nwhich there is a normal memory of occurrences prior to a given date, with\nloss of memory of what happened for a certain time after that date.\"\u2014\nTuke's Did. It should be added that the gap of memory may include\nsome period of time previous to the shock or accident which caused it.\n*Entencephalic.\u2014On the analogy of entoptic ; of sensations, etc., which\nhave their origin within the brain, not in the external world.\nExternalise.\u2014This word is used to represent the process by which an\nidea or impression on the percipient's mind is transformed into a phantasm\napparently outside him.\nHallucination.\u2014Any supposed sensory perception which has no objective\ncounterpart within the field of vision, hearing, etc., is termed a hallucination.\nHallucinations may be delusive orfalsidical, when there is nothing whatever\nto which they correspond ; or veridical, when they correspond (as those of\nwhich we treat generally correspond) to real events happening elsewhere. A.\npseudo-hallucination is a quasi-percept not sufficiently externalised to rank\nas a \" full-blown \" hallucination. Contrast with illusion and delusion.\nHyperboulia.\u2014See Aboulia.\nHyperkinesia.\u2014 Defined in Tuke's Dict, as \" over-activity of the memory,\na condition in which past acts, feelings, or ideas, are brought vividly to the\nmind, which, in its natural condition, has wholly lost the remembrance of\nthem.\" In my view the subliminal memory retains these remembrances\nthroughout, and their supraliminal evocation implies an increased grasp of\nnatural faculty. *Panmnesia would imply a potential recollection of all\nimpressions.\n*Hyperpromethia.\u2014Supernormal power of foresight ; attributed to the\nsubliminal self as a hypothesis by which to explain premonitions without\nassuming either that the future scene is shown to the percipient by any\nmind external to his own, or that circumstances which we regard as future\nare in any sense already existent.\nHypnagogic. Illusions hypnagogiques (Maury) are the vivid illusions of\nsight or sound\u2014\" faces in the dark,\" etc.\u2014which sometimes accompany the\noncoming of sleep. To similar illusions accompanying the departure of\nsleep, as when a dream-figure persists for a few moments into waking life,\nI have given the name *hypnopompic.\nHypnotism.\u2014See Mesmerism.\nHysteria.\u2014\"A disordered condition of the nervous system, the anato\nmical seat and nature of which are unknown to medical science, but of\nwhich the symptoms consist in well-marked and very varied disturbances of\n\fsupplement.] Glossary of Terms used in Psychical Research. 171\nnerve-function. \"\u2014Encyc.

Similarly, hypnogenous\nzones are regions by pressure on which sleep is induced.\nIdeational.\u2014Used of impressions which convey some distinct notion, but\nnot of sensory nature.\nIllusion.\u2014The misinterpretation of some object actually present to sight\nor hearing, as when a hanging coat is taken for a man, a ringing in the ears\nfor the sound of a bell, etc.\nImaginal.\u2014A word used of characteristics belonging to the perfect insect\nor imago ;\u2014and thus opposed to larval ;\u2014metaphorically applied to transcen\ndental faculties shown in rudiment in ordinary life.\nInduced. \u2014-Of phantasms, etc., intentionally produced.\nLevitation.\u2014A raising of objects from the ground by supposed supernormal\nmeans : especially of living persons, asserted in the case of S. Joseph of\nCopertino, and many other saints ; of D. D. Home, and of W. Stainton\nMoses.\nMedium.\u2014A person through whom communication is deemed to be carried\non between living men and spirits of the departed. As commonly used in\nspiritist literature, this word is liable to the objection that it assumes a\nparticular theory for phenomena which admit of explanation in various\nways. It is often better replaced by automatist or sensitive.\nMesmerism.\u2014This is the oldest widely-recognised word for a large group\nof phenomena discussed in many papers in these Proceedings. The name\nneed imply nothing more than the fact that Mesmer was the conspicuous\nintroducer of many of the phenomena to the European public. But it is\nalso specially used to imply something of his theory of their production, by\na vital effluence from the mesmeriser, conveyed partly by mesmericpasses, or\nwavings of the hands. The term Animal Magnetism implies a somewhat\ndifferent theory. The term Hypnotism, when first started by Braid, was\nagain meant to imply a theory of the genesis of these phenomena, but it is\nnow generally used with no theoretical implication.\nMessage. \u2014Used for any communication, not necessarily verbal, from one\nto another stratum of the automatist's personality, or from an external\nintelligence to one or other stratum of the automatist. Thus any automatic\nscript may be called a message, even if incoherent.\nMetalkesthesia.\u2014A form of sensibility alleged to exist which enables\nsome hypnotised or hysterical subjects to discriminate between the contacts\nof various metals by sensations not derived from their ordinary properties of\nweight, etc.\n*Methectic.\u2014Of communications between one stratum of a man's\nintelligence and another ; as when he writes messages whose origin is in\n\f172 [Supplement.\nF.

Writing so inverted, or,\nmore exactly, perverted, as to resemble writing reflected in a mirror, or\nblotted off on to a sheet of blotting paper. This form of writing is natural\nto some left-handed persons. It also frequently appears in automatic script.\nMnemonic chain.\u2014 A continuous series of memories, especially when the\ncontinuity persists after an interruption. See Disintegration ofpersonality.\nMonition.\u2014A message involving counsel or warning, when that counsel\nis based upon facts already in existence, but not normally known to the\nperson who receives the monition.\nMotor.\u2014Used of an impulse to action not carrying with it any definite\nidea or sensory impression.\nNegative hallucination.\u2014See Anesthesia.\nObjectify.\u2014To externalise a phantom in three dimensions ; to see it as a\nsolid object fitted into the waking world.\nPercipient.\u2014The correlative term to Agent ; the person on whose mind\nthe telepathic impact falls ; or more generally, the person who perceives any\nmotor or sensory impression.\nPhantasm and Phantom.\u2014Phantasm and phantom are, of course, mere\nvariants of the same word ; but since phantom has become generally\nrestricted to visual hallucinations, it is convenient to take phantasm to cover\na wider range, and to signify any hallucinatory sensory impression, whatever\nsense\u2014whether sight, hearing, touch, smell, taste, or diffused sensibility\u2014\nmay happen to be affected.\nPoint de rephre.\u2014Guiding mark. Used of some (generally inconspicuous)\nreal object which a hallucinated subject sees along with his hallucination,\nand whose behaviour under magnification, etc., suggests to him similar\nchanges in the hallucinatory figure.\nPolyzoism.\u2014The property, in a complex organism, of being composed of\nminor and quasi-independent organisms (like the polyzoa or '' sea-mats \").\nThis is sometimes called ' ' colonial constitution, \" from animal colonies ; but\nthe metaphor implied is not always suitable. The word polypsychism is\nsometimes used to express the psychical aspect of polyzoism.\nPost-hypnotic.\u2014Used of a suggestion given during the hypnotic trance,\nbut intended to operate after that trance has ceased.\nPrecognition.\u2014A knowledge of impending events supernormally acquired.\nPremonition.\u2014A supernormal indication of any kind of event still in\nthe future.\n*Preeersion.\u2014A tendency to characteristics assumed to lie at a further\npoint of the evolutionary progress of a species than has yet been reached ;\nopposed to reversion.\nProleptic.\u2014Anticipatory ; assuming a knowledge of a fact not yet\ncommunicated. A dream is called proleptic when it assumes some fact\nwhich is only made known to the dreamer later in the dream.

Now there is no reason to\nsuppose that the psychical phenomena with which we deal are less a part of\nnature, or less subject to fixed and definite law, than any other phenomena.\nSome of them appear to indicate a higher evolutionary level than the mass of\nmen have yet attained, and some of them appear to be governed by laws of\nsuch a kind that they may hold good in a transcendental world as fully as in\nthe world of sense.

Telesthesia\u2014\nperception at a distance\u2014may conveniently be interpreted in a similar way,\nas implying any direct sensation or perception of objects or conditions\nindependently of the recognised channels of sense, and also under such\ncircumstances that no known mind external to the percipient's can be\nsuggested as the source of the knowledge thus gained.\n*Telergy.\u2014A name for a hypothetical force or mode of action, concerned\nwith the conveyance of telepathic impressions, and perhaps with other\nsupernormal operation.\nVeridical.\u2014See Hallucination.\n\fGeneral Meetings. 175\nPROCEEDINGS OF GENERAL MEETINGS.\nThe 80th General Meeting of the Society was held at the West\nminster Town Hall on Friday, June 5th, at 8.30 p.m.; Professor\nBarrett in the chair.\nDr. J.

Milne Bramwell.\nI.\nPERSONALLY OBSERVED HYPNOTIC PHENOMENA.\nBy De. J. Milne Bramwell.\nDuring the last few years, I have occasionally been asked to give\nan account of my hypnotic experiences to this Society, on the ground\nthat, as I was constantly employed in hypnotic work at home, and had\nfrequently visited hypnotic centres abroad, I must have something\ninteresting to relate. I have hitherto refrained from doing so, chiefly\nbecause my researches have been almost entirely of a medical nature,\nand have contained little of general scientific interest. I have observed,\nhowever, certain facts which are not without importance in reference\nto hypnotic theory. These, I think, tend to show that the hypnotised\nsubject has a higher mental life than he is usually credited with, and\npossesses considerable selective power in reference to the commands of\nthe operator. These facts, together with an account of the remarkable\npower of appreciating time possessed by one hypnotised subject, will\nform the main features of this paper. I also propose giving a short\naccount of other phenomena, and will try to group them so as to\nform a general picture of the hypnotic state, as it appears to me.\nThe sequel to this paper will deal with these phenomena in relation\nship to the various theoretical explanations of hypnotism.\nMethods and Susceptibility.\nAs various theories have been based, both on the manner in which\nhypnosis is induced, as well as on the mental condition of those\ncapable of being hypnotised, it is necessary that I should say a word\nor two on these two points. I have never observed an instance in\nwhich hypnosis has followed mechanical means alone ; on the other\nhand, it has frequently appeared when these have been carefully\neliminated, and when the only method employed has been the creation\nby verbal suggestion of a picture of the desired condition. I have\nneither been able to confirm the observations of others in reference to\nthe value of chloroform and other narcotic drugs in inducing hypnosis,\nnor to succeed, as they claim to have done, in changing natural into\nhypnotic sleep.\nThe susceptibility to hypnosis varies widely, usually in proportion\nto the subject's power of concentration. Where voluntary attention\nis absent, as in idiots, hypnosis is impossible ; where, as in insanity,\n\fPersonally observed Hypnotic Phenomena. 177\nhysteria, &c., the attention is actively engaged in other directions,\nhypnosis is generally difficult.\nThe following figures, comprising two groups of 100 consecutive\ncases, illustrate this. In group No. 1, many were in good health when\nI attempted to hypnotise them, while of the remainder, few suffered\nfrom diseases calculated to interfere with their powers of attention.\nThe results in this class were as follows :\u2014\nSlight hypnosis, 1 2. Deep hypnosis, 40. Somnambules, 48. Re\nfractory, 0. Hypnotised at first attempt, 92. After repeated trials, 8 :\naverage number of trials in these eight cases, 4.\nIn group No. 2, nearly all suffered from grave and long-standing\nnervous disease, and with them the susceptibility was considerably\ndecreased, thus :\u2014\nSlight hypnosis, 35. Deep hypnosis, 13. Somnambules, 29. Re\nfractory, 23. In the 77 successful cases hypnosis was obtained at the\nfirst attempt in 51 instances. After repeated trials, in 26 : average\nnumber of trials in these 26 cases, 15.\nSex apparently exerted no influence on susceptibilty.\nHypnotic Phenomena.\nClosure of the eyes is usually the first phenomenon observed in\nhypnosis, and as soon as this occurs other alterations in the voluntary\nmuscles can usually be induced by suggestion. In reference to these\nI have nothing special to report. I, like others, have seen that\nvoluntary muscular power can be increased or diminished to a\nremarkable extent.\nInvoluntary Muscles and Special Senses.\u2014The action of the in\nvoluntary muscles and the special senses can be influenced in hypnosis.\nOf this I have seen many striking instances, but will confine myself\nalmost entirely to one case, that of a woman aged forty, in which all\nthe experiments were checked by independent observers.\nPulse.\u2014In this subject, the rapidity of the pulse could be quickly\nincreased or diminished by simply suggesting that it should beat faster\nor slower. These changes, as recorded by the sphygmograph, showed\ncorresponding alterations in tension.\nMuscular Sense.\u2014Differences in weight as small as eight grains\ncould be distinguished in the hypnotic state; this the patient was quite\nunable to do in the normal condition.\nThermal Sensibility. \u2014She was able to discriminate between very\nslight changes in temperature, such as she was unable to appreciate\nwhen awake.\nCommon Cutaneous Sensibility.\u2014The common cutaneous sensibility\nwas nearly double, i.e., the patient could distinguish the points of a\nn 2\n\f178 Dr. J. Milne Bramwell.\ncompass, applied to different parts of the body, at about half the\nnormal distance. She possessed no increased power when awake.\nHearing.\u2014The range of hearing could be doubled by suggestion.\nSight.\u2014The variations in this patient's range of vision were\nrecorded for me by Mr. Bendelack Hewetson, Ophthalmic Surgeon\nto the Leeds Infirmary ; and, as they appear to be of considerable\ninterest, I will give them in detail. He first saw her in 1889, long\nbefore she had been hypnotised, and reported that she was hyper\nmetropic ; that this condition was over-corrected by ciliary spasm ;\nthat she could only read the third line of Snellen's test types, and\nrequired a minus glass to enable her to read the bottom line. In\nhypermetropia, as many of my readers are doubtless aware, the axis of\nthe eye is shorter than normal, and the rays of light, or a certain pro\nportion of them, in passing through the lens, are focussed at a point\nbehind the retina. In this case, as the result of spasm of the muscles\nof accommodation, the position, and possibly the curvature of the lens\nwas altered ; i.e., it was projected further forward and rendered more\nconvex. In consequence of this, the hypermetropia, which was only\nslight, was not only neutralised, but over-corrected. Thus the patient\nwas rendered virtually myopic ; the axis of the eye had become longer\nthan normal, and the rays of light were focussed at a point in front of,\ninstead of behind, the retina. At this time treatment by glasses\nfailed to relieve the defect, as the patient, who suffered from other\nnervous affections, was unable to wear them. She was first hypno\ntised in March, 1892, when I observed that I could apparently alter\nthe range of vision by suggestion. In the following July she was again\nexamined by Mr. Hewetson, who found the physical condition and\nrange of vision identical with what it had been in 1889. Suggestions\nwere then made in his presence, with the view of increasing the range\nof vision, whereupon the spasm disappeared, and the patient easily\nread the bottom line of Snellen's test types without a glass. After\nhaving shown that the spasm, with its accompanying defective vision,\ncould be restored, I suggested its total disappearance. In June, 1893,\nMr. Hewetson again examined the patient, and reported that the\nrange of vision was normal, and that there was no return of the\nspasm.\nAnalgesia.\u2014With this patient, as with many others, hypnotic\nanalgesia could be easily induced. On one occasion she had six teeth\npainlessly extracted, and on another four. There was no pain at any\ntime after these operations, and the healing process was a remarkably\nquick one. A powerful application of the Faradic brush was also\nunattended by any disagreeable sensation.\nChange of Temperature.\u2014On two occasions only have I had an\nopportunity of testing whether the suggested sensations of heat and\n\fPersonally observed Hypnotic Phenomena. 179\ncold were accompanied by change in temperature. The subject of both\nexperiments was a young man, a remarkably good somnambule, in\nwhom all the usual phenomena of deepest hypnosis could be induced.\nDr. Waller, the well-known physiologist, recorded the temperature by\nmeans of a delicate electrical apparatus, capable of registering fractions\nof a degree of change, while I alternately made emphatic and prolonged\nsuggestions of heat and cold. The result was an entirely negative one.\nAppreciation of Time by Somnambules.\nTo Professor Delboeuf's experiments in this direction my own owe\ntheir origin. Delboeuf drew attention to the fact that, in most\ninstances in which it had been suggested to somnambules to do some\nthing at the end of a certain number of days, this had been rendered\nmore simple by the terminal day falling upon some easily recognisable\ndate, such as the New Year, and, as the subject knew this, the\nsuggestion was equivalent to saying that he was to do something on\nNew Year's Day. To avoid mistakes of this kind and to render the\ntest conditions more stringent, Delboeuf made his suggestions in\nminutes varying in number from 350 to 3,300. In thirteen experi\nments there were only two complete successes ; in the majority of the\nremainder there was a partial success, with an error of a tenth to\na thirty-seventh of the interval. Despite these failures, Professor\nDelboeuf considered that the successes, under the conditions in which he\nobtained them, were amongst the most extraordinary things presented\nby induced somnambulism.\nI propose at present to conftne my account to the history of one\ncase and, as the results obtained were so extraordinary, I will put\nbefore you as many details as possible, in order to present a fairly\ncomplete picture of the subject of the experiments, and of the circum\nstances under which they were carried out.\nMiss , the patient in question, aged 19, was first hypnotised\nby me on September 2nd, 1895. At this time she had suffered from\nmuscular tremor of both arms and legs for about twelve montha\nThe illness had appeared after over-exertion and mental strain, the\nresult of nursing a relative who died after a long illness. Previously,\nthe general health had been good and there had been no signs of\nhysteria. Family history good. After about three weeks of hypnotic\ntreatment the tremor disappeared, and has not returned since. The\npatient is intelligent and fairly well educated, but possesses no\nextraordinary calculating powers either in the normal state or in\nhypnosis. According to her mother, she has always been remarkably\ntruthful and well-conducted, rather grave in disposition and inclined\nto take the duties of life seriously. She is a dressmaker, and is in\nthe employment of a personal friend, but lives at home. She is fond\n\f180 Dr. J. Milne Bramwell.\nof her business, and her main interest in life, apart from it, appears\nto be a kind of amateur mission work, which she carries out with\nconsiderable success amongst the children of a poor and rough\nneighbourhood. Her parents are shopkeepers and are comfortably\noff for their position in life.\nSome time before the commencement of the experiments, she had\nbecome a good somnambule, and I had satisfied myself of the\ngenuineness of this condition before thinking of making her the\nsubject of any experiment. She could be made analgesic or\nanaesthetic by suggestion. The touching of the cornea or the tickling\nof the back of the throat with a feather produced no reflex, and the\npassing of a needle deeply into the flesh was unattended by pain.\nShe never spontaneously recalled in the waking state anything that\noccurred in hypnosis. During this time she was also treated medically\nby suggestion, but this was only for a functional disturbance, which\nwas of little importance in reference to her general physical state,\nand of none in regard to her mental one. With the exception of a\nshort time towards the close of the experiments, when she was\nsuffering from the effects of a severe fall, she was in good health,\nand on more than one occasion she rode over fifty miles in a day on\na heavy tricycle without undue fatigue.\nThe experiments were all of the same character. On each occasion\nI suggested to her, during hypnosis, that at the expiration of a varying\nnumber of minutes she should feel impelled to make a cross on a piece\nof paper with a pencil and also, without looking at clock or watch,\nwrite down what time she believed it to be, and then immediately\ncompare this with the actual time and, if possible, obtain corroborative\ntestimony from her friends.\nExperiment No. 1. November 5th, 1895, 4 p.m.\u2014Suggestion to\nto be realised in five hours and twenty minutes, i.e., at the expiration\nof that time the patient was to make a cross and put down the time\nin the manner just described. Result.\u2014Correct.\nRemarks.\u2014On this occasion I did not say anything to the patient\nabout the experiment, either before or after hypnosis. I told her\nmother its nature, but not the time at which the suggestion should be\nfulfilled. At 9.15 the same evening her mother noticed that the\npatient was restless and asked her what was the matter. She replied,\n\" I feel I must do something, but cannot tell what.\" At 9.20 p.m.\nshe rapidly made a cross with a pencil and wrote 20 minutes past 9 on\na piece of paper, at the same time saying, \" It's all silliness.\" There\nwas no clock in the room, but her mother went into the next room\nwhere there was one, and found that the time was 9.20. When I\nagain saw the patient I explained the nature of the experiments I\nproposed making to her, and instructed her always to carry a pencil\n\fPersonally observed Hypnotic Phenomena. 181\nand paper with her during the day, and to put one by her bedside at\nnight. I did not describe them as anything extraordinary, but simply\ntold her that hypnotised subjects were often able to calculate time, and\nthat I wished to see whether she could do so. No pecuniary or other\nreward was promised or given. I told her I should make these\nexperimental suggestions from time to time, but not on each occasion\nwhen she visited me. I neither told her in the waking condition that\nthe suggestions had been made, nor informed her relatives when I\nmade them, or what they were. They knew that suggestions of this\nnature were given frequently, but only became acquainted with them\non seeing the patient carry them out, or on hearing from her that she\nhad done so. Invariably, before making the suggestions, I wrote them\ndown in my case-book, and when the patient again visited me I copied\ninto it what she had written on the different pieces of paper. In many\ninstances I did not calculate when the suggestions fell due, and in\nothers the calculations I made at the time were proved to be erroneous,\nand the results of the experiments were in these cases only determined\nwhen the series was completed.\nExperiment No. 2.\u2014November 28th, 1895, 2 p.m. Suggestion in\n320 minutes.

She said it was to be executed in\n11,225 minutes. It is possible, but not at all likely, that I had made\na mistake, as I had read the suggestion to her with the figures before\nmy eyes. The supposed suggestion of 11,225 minutes had been carried\nout correctly.\nI now attempted to find out during hypnosis the patient's mental\ncondition in reference to these suggestions. In reply to my questions\nshe informed me :\u20141. That when the suggestions were made in\nhypnosis she did not calculate when they fell due. 2. That she did\nnot calculate them at any time afterwards. 3. That she had no\nrecollection of them when awakened. 4. That no memory of them\never arose in the waking state. 5. That shortly before their fulfil\nment she always experienced a motor impulse, that her fingers moved\nas if to grasp a pencil and to perform the act of writing. 6. That\nthis impulse was immediately followed by the idea of making a cross,\nand of the time. 7. That she never looked at clock or watch until\nafter she had written the figures.\nExperiments.\u2014Wednesday, January 8th, 1896.\nNo. 10.\u20144.5 p.m. Suggestion in 4,417 minutes.\nNo. 11.\u20144.5 p.m. Suggestion in 11,470 minutes.\nNo. 12.\u20144.30 p.m. Suggestion in 10,070 minutes.\nResults.\u2014No. 10.\u20145.42 p.m., Saturday, January 11th.\nNo. 11.\u20143.15 p.m., Thursday, January 16th.\nNo. 12.\u20144.20. p.m., Wednesday, January 15th.\u2014All were correct.\nRemarks.\u2014As the patient had stated in hypnosis that she made\nno calculations in reference to the suggestions, in order to vary the\nexperiments, I asked her as soon as I had made them, and before\nawakening her, to calculate mentally when they would fall due, and to\ntell me the result.\nShe replied as follows :\u2014\n\"No. 10 in 3 days, 37 minutes, or 23 minutes to 5 next Saturday\nafternoon.\n\"No. 11 in 187 hours, 50 minutes, or 7 days, 9 hours, 50 minutes.\nNext Wednesday morning at 5 minutes to 12.\n\fPersonally observed Hypnotic Phenomena. 183\n\"No. 12 in 1,067 hours, 40 minutes, or 6 days, 23 hours, and 40\nminutes. 4.20 p.m. next Wednesday.\"\nIn No. 10, the answer was 1 hour, 5 minutes too early, the interval\n(which was 1 hour tdo short) having apparently been calculated from\n4 o'clock, instead of 4.5 p.m.\nIn No. 1 1 the answer was 1 day, 3 hours, 20 minutes too early.\nHere (1) the interval is calculated as 187 hours, 50 minutes, showing\nthat 11,470 has probably been mistaken for 11,270. (2) 187 hours,\n50 minutes, is stated to be equal to 7 days, 9 hours, 50 minutes, instead\nof 7 days, 19 hours, 50 minutes. The answer seems, however, to have\nbeen calculated with the latter interval, but (3) a mistake of 1 day is\nmade.\nIn No. 12 the answer is correct, but does not correspond with the\ncalculations ; 10,070 minutes equals 167 hours, 50 minutes, not 1,067\nhours, 40 minutes. Here (1) a cypher has been wrongly inserted, and\n(2) 40 minutes miscalculated for 50. The former error is corrected,\nbut the latter repeated when 6 days, 23 hours, 40 minutes is given\ninstead of 6 days, 23 hours, 50 minutes.\nWhen No. 12 was fulfilled the patient had been asleep in my\nconsulting-room for an hour. There was no clock in the room. I was\nhypnotising another patient, Mrs. M. Exactly at 4.20, without\nawaking or opening her eyes, the patient said she had to make a cross\nand put the time down. When the suggestions were realised in my\npresence I invariably noticed the motor impulse previously described\nby the patient. From this date, I arranged that a certain number of\nthe experiments should be fulfilled when the patient visited me. On\nthese occasions she was sometimes awake, sometimes asleep. In\nalmost every instance I made her write the time she thought it was\nin my case book, and frequently was able to get this witnessed and\nsigned by others who were present. On these occasions I compared\nmy watch beforehand with the Vere-street Post Office clock, in order\nto insure greater accuracy.\nFrom this time I usually made a number of suggestions to the\npatient at each stance. Sometimes these started from the same hour,\nsometimes from different hours. In the latter case the starting points\nwere usually imaginary, i.e., I said to the patient, \"You are to suppose\nit is such a time, and carry out the suggestions in so many minutes\nfrom that imaginary starting point.\" The suggestions were all made\nrapidly one after the other.\nExperiments.\u2014Wednesday, January 15th, 4.45 p.m.\nNo. 13.\u2014From 4.45 p.m. Suggestion in 4,453 minutes.\nNo. 14.\u2014From 2 p.m. Suggestion in 10,470 minutes.\nNo. 15. \u2014From 3 p.m. Suggestion in 10,060 minutes.\n\f184 Dr. J.

Perhaps 4,453 was mistaken for 43,353, equalling 722\nhours, 33 minutes. The answer has been calculated from the interval\nof No. 14.\nIn No. 14 the answer was 4 hours, 25 minutes too early. 10,470\nminutes equals 174 hours, 30 minutes, not 197 hours, 30 minutes.\nThe answer also does not correspond with either interval, but is nearly\nthe same as the answer given in No. 15. There is no explanation for\neither of these two independent errors.\nIn No. 15 the answer was 1 hour, 45 minutes too late. The\nwrongly calculated interval, 8 days, 5 hours, 30 minutes, corresponds to\nthe wrongly calculated 197 hours, 30 minutes of No. 14 ; this interval\nhaving apparently remained in the mind. The time of falling due\nhas been calculated with 4.45 as initial time, as in No. 13, instead\nof 3 p.m.\nWhen I made the patient calculate when the suggestions would\nfall due, and found that her calculations were wrong, I naturally con\ncluded that, as she had fixed the date at which the suggestions were\nto be fulfilled in her own mind, in the hypnotic state, they would be\ncarried out at the erroneous times. My astonishment was, great when\nI found they were executed correctly. I rehypnotised the patient and\nsaid to her, \" You have not carried out these suggestions at the time\nyou told me they would fall due. Why is this 1 \" She replied, \" What\nI told you was all wrong.\" \" How do you know the others are right ?\"\n\" I can't tell you, I only feel that they are.'' I was not able to elicit\nby questioning any memory of the processes by which the original\nmistakes were corrected. The patient assured me that from the time\nthe suggestions were made she had never again thought of them, and\nthat at the time of their fulfilment she had suddenly had the impulse\nto put down the figures. When doing so she had no recollection of\nher original calculations.\n\fPersonally observed Hypnotic Phenomena. 185\nExperiments.\u2014Wednesday, January 22nd, 4.5 p.m.\nNo. 16.\u2014Suggestion in 20,180 minutes.\nNo. 17.\u2014Suggestion in 20,160 minutes.\nNo. 18.\u2014Suggestion in 20,140.\nResults.\u2014No. 16.\u2014February 5th, 4.25 p.m.\nNo. 17.\u2014February 5th, 4.5 p.m.\nNo. 18.\u2014February 5th, 3.45. p.m.\u2014All correct.\nRemarks.\u2014On Wednesday, February 5th, I hypnotised the patient\nat 3 p.m. At 3.45 she said the time was 3.45, and that she wished to\nmake a cross.

She was told not to make any calculations. I\ndid not calculate when the suggestions would fall due at the time I\nmade them. Nos. 34, 35, and 36 were executed during sleep, and the\npapers, as usual, were found by the patient at her bedside in the\nmorning. No. 38 was carried out at 3.48 p.m., on March 4th, instead\nof at 3.50, when it really fell due. The patient, however, stated the\ntime correctly at which she ought to have carried it out, viz., 3.50. It\nis to be noted that 3.50, March 4th, is the date at which another\nsuggestion made a fortnight before fell due, and this has already\nbeen recorded in its proper place. The patient stated at 3.48 that she\nhad to make two crosses and to put down 3.50 twice. No. 37, due at\n4.15 p.m., Wednesday, March 4th, I have no record of. I am not quite\ncertain whether this is my fault or the patient's. I was hypno\ntising another patient when the suggestions were fulfilled and may\nhave omitted to enter this one. On the other hand, the patient may\nhave failed to carry it out. Three suggestions fell due very quickly,\nand one of them, as we have seen, belonged to another series.

Mr. Barkworth, a well-known\nmember of this Society, and Dr. Barclay, a medical friend, were\npresent during the greater part of the seance on Wednesday, March\n11th, and witnessed and signed the suggestions as they fell due.\nWhen the patient said it was 3.20 the exact time was 3.22. When\nshe said it was 3.45 the exact time was 3.44. When she said it\nwas 3.50 [No. 39 of former series, made February 26th] the time\nwas 3.51J.\nAt this seance, March 11th, fresh suggestions were made under the\nfollowing conditions. Mr. Barkworth and Dr. Barclay were both put\nen rapport with the patient, and it was agreed that they should each\nmake two time suggestions to her, arranged so as to fall due at the next\nseance, when they both promised to be present. The suggestions were\nmade when I was out of the room, and I was not told what they were\nuntil after their fulfilment. While I was still in the room, both\ngentlemen were busy for some considerable time with pencil and paper\nbefore they were able to work out their calculations correctly, and I\nobserved a great deal of whispered consultation and frequent correc\ntion of their results. At least, I imagined that this was what was\ntaking place, for I did not hear what they said.\nOn Thursday, March 26th, I hypnotised the patient at 12.30 p.m.\nMr. Barkworth was present and Dr. Barclay came later. At 22\nminutes to 1 the patient said she had to make a cross at 20 minutes\n\f190 Dr. J. Milne Bramwell.\nto 1. Error of 2 minutes. Mr. Barkworth corroborated the time. At\n1 minute to 1 she said she had to mark 1 o'clock. Error of 1 minute\nas checked by Mr. Barkworth and myself. At 8 minutes past 1 she\nsaid she had to mark the time : this was correct. At 14 minutes\npast 1 she again said she had to mark the time : this also was correct.\nDr. Barclay was now present.\nMr. Barkworth and Dr. Barclay had both mislaid their notes and\nwere unable with certainty to recall the suggestions. The patient was\nasked during hypnosis if she remembered them and replied :\u2014\" They\nwere made at 4 p.m. last Wednesday week, and were to be fulfilled in\n21,400, 21,420, 21,428, and 21,434 minutes.1' She said Mr. Barkworth\nhad made two of these suggestions and Dr. Barclay the others, and\nthat she had made no calculation at the time and had not thought of\nthem afterwards. These questions were put to the patient after the\nsuggestions had been fulfilled. On other occasions, when a week or\ntwo had elapsed after the suggestions had been executed, I found that\nshe was unable to recall them correctly in hypnosis. On April 22nd,\nDr. Barclay sent me the lost memo, of his two suggestions, viz., 21,428\nand 21,434 minutes, from 4 p.m. on the day already mentioned. On\nApril 27th, Mr. Barkworth wrote to tell me that he also had found\nhis lost memo, and that the suggestions were 21,400, 21,420, 21,428,\nand 21,434 minutes ; the first two having been made by himself and\nthe two latter by Dr. Barclay. This agrees with the patient's account.\nThe results of the suggestions were correct, with the exception of the\nminute differences in time already mentioned. These experiments just\nrecorded are Nos. 46, 47, 48, and 49.\nApril 8th, 1896.\u2014 A fresh series of suggestions was made on this\nday, some to fall due during the night, some next day in my presence.\nThe patient lost her papers recording those made at home and I was\ntoo busy to enter at the time those that were fulfilled in my presence,\nand therefore cannot be sure of the results. These are the only\nexperiments in the whole series which are not recorded and are only\nomitted for the above reasons.\nExperiments.\u2014Thursday, May 7th, 3 p.m.\nNo. 50.\u2014Suggestion in 8,650 minutes.\nNo. 51.\u2014Suggestion in 8,680 minutes.\nNo. 52.\u2014Suggestion in 8,700 minutes.\nI still further complicated these by suggesting as follows :\u2014\n\" No. 50 is to be fulfilled in the waking state. Five minutes\nbefore 51 comes due you are to fall asleep. No. 51 is to be fulfilled\nwhile you are asleep, and five minutes afterwards you are to awake\nand remain so until after the fulfilment of No. 52. Eight minutes\nafter 52 falls due you are again to fall asleep.\"\n\fPersonally observed Hypnotic Phenomena. 191\nResult.\u2014These suggestions were carried out correctly, with the\nexception that she fell asleep at 3.31 instead of 3.35.\nRemarks.\u2014On May 13th, the patient came into my consulting\nroom at 3.5 p.m., and almost immediately fainted. She would have\nfallen, had I not caught her in my arms and laid her down. She had\nrecently met with a severe accident, and was in acute suffering.\nImmediately on regaining consciousness, she said she had to make a\ncross at 3.10, and did so in my case book. Time correct. She fell\nasleep at 3.31, and at 3.40 she said she had to make a cross, and mark\n20 minutes to 4. She awoke spontaneously at 3.45. Exactly at 4\no'clock she said she had to make a cross, and mark 4 o'clock. Exactly\nat 4.8 she fell asleep. Others were present in the room when all\nthese suggestions were fulfilled, with the exception of the first.\nExperiments.\u2014Wednesday, May 13th, 4.30 p.m.\nOn this occasion I said to the patient, \" You are to carry out all\nthe suggestions made last Thursday, but to-day you are to start from\n2.55 instead of from 3 p.m., and to each of them you are to add 1,440\nminutes.\" As I was much pressed for time, these suggestions were\nmade very hurriedly, and without explanation, and I was not at all\ncertain whether the patient understood them.\nResults.\u2014Correct, with the exception of slight differences between\nthe correctly estimated time and the moment at which the suggestion\nwas fulfilled.\nRemarks.\u2014On Wednesday, May 20th, the patient entered my\nroom at 3 p.m. At 3.5, in the waking state, she said she had to make\na cross and mark the time. She fell asleep at 3.30 and at 3.35 she\nsaid she had to make a cross and write down 25 minutes to 4. She\ncontinued asleep until 3.40, when she awoke spontaneously. According\nto the suggestions made last week, she was to remain awake until the\nfulfilment of the next suggestion, but, as she was still suffering from\nthe effects of her accident, I hypnotised her and made curative\nsuggestions, and told her she would awake one minute before the\nnext suggestion fell due. She awoke at 3.49, and at 3.50 said she\nhad to make a cross and mark the time, which she stated to be 3.55.\nI hypnotised her again immediately. At 4.3, while still asleep, she\nsaid it was 3 minutes past 4 and that I had suggested she should\nfall asleep at that hour. The suggestions were correctly fulfilled,\nwith the exception that the suggestion due at 3.55 was carried\nout at 3.50, although she stated it to be due at 3.55. It is worth\nnoting that on this occasion the patient fell asleep at 3.30, the\nexact time suggested, on the last occasion she fell asleep at 3.31\ninstead of 3.35 as suggested. This is interesting, as the latter\nsuggestion, carried out correctly, was the former one complicated\no\n\f192 Br. J. Milne Bramwell.\nby 5 minutes having been deducted from the starting point and\n1,440 minutes added to the interval.\nThese experiments, Nos. 53, 54, and 55, complete the series, but\nthe subject is still available for further ones and I shall be glad to\nreceive any suggestions in reference to them.\nSummary.\nFifty-five experiments are recorded ; of these one apparently was\nnot carried out at all, while in another (No. 9) the patient had mis\ntaken the original suggestion and fulfilled it correctly in accordance\nwith what she thought it had been. The remainder were completely\nsuccessful, with the exception that in eight instances (Nos. 33, 38, 39,\n40, 41, 46, 47, 55) there were minute differences, never exceeding five\nminutes, between the patient's correct estimation of when the sugges\ntion fell due and the moment at which she carried it out. The\nproportions which these errors bear to the respective intervals vary\nbetween 1 to 2,028 and 1 to 21,420.\nAs regards a certain proportion of the experiments, the correctness\nof the results depends upon the evidence of the patient and her friends.\nThe remainder, however, were carried out before me and other wit\nnesses. In reference to these the following particulars are worthy\nof note. (1.) A complicated series of figures, which she would have\nbeen unable to remember when awake, was read over to the patient\nwhile asleep. (2.) These generally started from imaginary hours, and\nwhen she calculated in hypnosis when they fell due she was frequently\nwrong. Thus, out of 24 calculations, the first 9 were wrong, and, of\nthe remaining 15, 11 were right and 4 wrong. It is worthy of note\nthat, as the experiments advanced, not only the frequency, but also the\nextent of these errors decreased, and the answers were given much\nmore rapidly. The errors in calculation had apparently no effect\non the ultimate results, these, with few exceptions, being correct.\n(3.) She sometimes remained asleep for an hour or more after the\nsuggestions were made. (4.) She had no recollection of the sug\ngestions in the waking state. (5.) When the suggestions were fulfilled\nin my presence and in that of other witnesses she had sometimes\nbeen several hours, either asleep or awake, under such conditions that it\nwas impossible for her to consult the time. (6.) It was impossible fot\nher to receive direct or indirect suggestions from me, as I rarely knew\nthe exact time at which the suggestion was due, and was generally\nbusily occupied in hypnotising some other patient. I may add that I\nhave a bad memory for figures, and even when I had previously\ncorrectly estimated the time of fulfilment, this was never in my mind\nwhen the patient carried out the suggestion. (7.) The results of the\nexperiments were only completely estimated after the series was com\n\fPersonally observed Hypnotic Phenomena. 193\npleted, when a friend, Mr. Bartrum, B.Sc., kindly checked them for\nme. He discovered that some of my calculations made at the time\nhad been erroneous. I am also indebted to him for a critical examina\ntion of the calculations the patient was asked to make when the\nsuggestions were given.\nMemory.\nMemory in relationship to hypnotic states varies widely, and is\ninfluenced by the depth of the hypnosis, the personality of the subject,\nand the suggestions of the operator.\nMemory in hypnosis may be :\u2014\n(1) Unchanged.\nIn this group the subjects when hypnotised can recall the eyents of\nwaking life, and on awakening can remember all that has passed.\nIn some instances, however, where the memory is apparently\nunchanged, closer examination shows that it has either been increased\nor diminished. Of this the two following cases are examples.\n(a) Miss A. I had frequently hypnotised this patient and could\ninfluence by suggestion, not only the voluntary muscles, but also the\nspecial senses. On awakening she could always recall what had passed,\ndespite suggestions to the contrary. At a later date I found I could\nmake her analgesic by suggestion. Touching the cornea, passing\nneedles deeply into the flesh, and probing the nose and vocal chords\nwere unaccompanied by pain or disagreeable sensation. On awaking,\ndespite suggested amnesia, the patient could recall all the tactile\nsensations associated with these operations, but was unable, even in\nresponse to suggestion, to revive any memory of pain.\n(b) Mrs. B. In this patient certain changes in the voluntary\nmuscles and special senses could also be induced, all of which she\nremembered on awaking. She could not, however, be made analgesic\nby suggestion. Though her memory was apparently unchanged,\nexperiment revealed the existence of a sub-conscious memory, superior\nto her normal one. I suggested to her during hypnosis that she should\nfall asleep the first time a certain friend called and shook hands with\nher. On awaking she remembered the suggestion, A week or two\npassed without the friend calling, when one day he met her at my\nhouse and shook hands with her. She did not fall asleep. We had\nboth forgotten the exact terms of the suggestion and believed it had\nbeen a failure. Some time afterwards the friend called at the patient's\nown house and she fell asleep the moment he shook hands with her.\nShe was not thinking of the suggestion at the time.\n(2) The subject may remember during hypnosis the events of\nwaking life, with a clearness corresponding to his powers of memory\nin the normal state, and on awakening have a more or less indistinct\nrecollection of what has passed. The subject will frequently state\no 2\n\f194 Br. J. Milne Bramwell.\nthat he can recall all that has been said or done, but on questioning\nhim it will generally be found that he remembers very little and that\nthis fades rapidly.\n(3) Here, in response to suggestion, the subject may recall the\nevents of waking life to a greater extent than he could do in the\nnormal condition, as well as what has taken place during previous\nhypnoses ; and, on awaking, may have lost all recollection of what has\noccurred. The lost memory can be restored to a greater or lesser\nextent by suggestion. The improvement in memory extends to remote\nas well as recent incidents, and I have noticed numerous examples of\nboth. One patient, whose natural memory was unusually bad, was able\nto recall on awaking some verses with which she was previously\nunacquainted, and which were only read over to her twice during\nhypnosis. Another, who could play a few dance tunes upon the\npiano, but who could only do so with the music before her when\nawake, was able, when hypnotised and blindfolded, to play the same\ntunes much more brilliantly. I have found that subjects who could\nnot remember events which happened at an earlier age than six or\nseven were able, when hypnotised, to recall those which had occurred\nat the age of two and a-half years. In many of these instances I\nhave obtained confirmatory evidence, at all events as regards the\noccurrence of the facts themselves, from the testimony of older relatives.\nThe recollection during the hypnotic state of what has occurred\nin waking life, and previous hypnotic conditions, rarely appears\nspontaneously in the first instance. In some cases frequent sugges\ntions are necessary in order to obtain this revival of memory, but\nonce induced, it will often recur spontaneously in subsequent\nhypnoses, or at all events, it can then be easily produced by\nsuggestion. When a subject has forgotten on awaking the events\nof the hypnotic state, I have never observed a spontaneous revival of\nthis lost memory in the normal condition.\n(4) The subject may be unable, owing to suggestion, to recall during\nhypnosis the events of waking life, or those of previous hypnoses, and\non awaking may have lost all recollection of what has taken place.\nThis lost memory will not reappear spontaneously, but can be revived\nby suggestion. For example, one of my patients, a nervous girl, was\nmuch frightened by seeing a friend in a fit, and was unable to dismiss\nthe scene from her mind. This was blotted out by suggestion, and\nshe has not thought of it since, either in the normal state or in\nhypnosis.\n(5) The subject may be unable, even in response to suggestion, to\nremember certain events and sensations of previous hypnoses. Of\nthis we have already had an example in the patient who could not\nrecall painful sensations after suggested analgesia. This case may\n\fPersonally observed Hypnotic Phenomena. 195\nbe taken as a typical one, for amongst the numerous operations\nperformed during hypnosis with which I have had to do, I have in no\ninstance been able to revive any memory of pain. Certain events,\nparticularly those occurring in the lethargic condition, cannot be\nrecalled by suggestion. \u25a0 For example, some subjects are unable to\nremember various sounds from the outside world, or to recall things\nsaid and done by the spectators, but not referring to them. Others\ncan remember everything that has passed in a previous lethargic\ncondition, even when it has been suggested that they should forget it.\nFor instance, I hypnotised C., a good somnambule, and suggested that\nhe should hear nothing but my voice, and that only when I addressed\nhim directly. I then held a long conversation with a medical friend,\non a topic unconnected with the patient or with hypnotism. On\nawaking, 0. was unable to recall anything that had been said. On\nbeing rehypnotised, however, in response to suggestion, he gave a better\nprecis of the conversation than either my friend or I could have done.\n(6) The subject may recall during hypnosis the events of previous\nhypnoses and those of waking life, the latter to a greater extent than\nhe could do in the normal condition ; and by suggestion this memory\nmay be retained on awaking.\nHere amnesia has been prevented by suggestion, and there is now\nno break in the memory of the hypnotised subject. The only alteration\nis one of improvement ; the subject now remembers in the waking state\npast events which he was unable voluntarily to recall, but the memory\nof which has been revived in hypnosis. He also recalls the recent\nimpressions he has received during hypnosis,\u2014impressions which he\nwould not have been able to revive so vividly had they been made in\nthe waking state. He remembers, for instances, the piece of poetry\nwhich has been read to him twice during hypnosis, and which he would\nhave required to have heard read many times in the normal state in\norder to retain an equally clear recollection of it.\nMemory in reference to certain Post-Hypnotic Conditions.\nI formerly believed that all post-hypnotic acts, resulting from\nsuggestion in hypnosis, were forgotten immediately after fulfilment. I\nhave lately observed, however, that when the suggestions are carried\nout some time after awaking, this is by no means always the case. If I\nsuggest to a subject that his arm will become rigid on awaking, this\npost-hypnotic act is immediately forgotten after fulfilment. On the\nother hand, if I successfully suggest to the same patient, who perhaps\nhas been suffering from insomnia, that he will sleep eight hours the\nfollowing night, he will remember that he has done so.\nAn attempt was made by some members of the Hypnotic Committee\nof this Society to recall by means of suggestion what had occurred\n\f196 Br. J. Milne Bramwell.\nduring the administration of nitrous oxide gas. This was a failure,\nand I have also been unsuccessful in my endeavours to revive in a\nsimilar way the recollection of what has taken place during normal\nsleep. With one subject, whose memory during hypnosis of the events\nof waking life was exceptionally good, I carried out the following\nexperiment :\u2014The patient was in the habit of falling asleep every\nSunday afternoon in his arm-chair, and it was arranged, on these\noccasions, that he should be read aloud to, and that the same sentences\nshould be repeated again and again. I afterwards hypnotised him, and\ntried to make him recall what he had heard, but the experiment,\nthough frequently repeated, was invariably unsuccessful.\nWith another patient I tried in the same manner to revive the\nmemory of what had happened in a series of attacks of a hysterical\nnature, in which an apparent change of personality had occurred.\nThe attempt was a failure, despite the fact that the patient was a\ngood somnambule.\nWaking Somnambulism.\nThis term is applied by Beaunis to a condition in which the patient\nwill accept suggestions similar to hypnotic ones, without having on\nthat occasion been subjected to any hypnotic process, or having passed\nthrough any state resembling sleep or trance. He considers the\ncondition a hypnotic one for two reasons : (1) The patient will receive\nother suggestions of a hypnotic nature; (2) These suggestions are\nforgotten immediately after fulfilment. I have observed that all\nsubjects, in whom hypnosis has previously been induced, will sub\nsequently exhibit the same range of phenomena in response to suggestion\nin the apparently waking state. On the other hand, I have noticed\nsome slight points of difference between the two conditions. In\nwaking somnambulism, while sometimes the suggestions were forgotten\nalmost immediately, at others they were remembered for a longer\nperiod, and in some cases were recalled after the lapse of weeks. The\nsubject of one of these experiments was questioned in hypnosis in\nreference to her memory of suggestions carried out in the state of\nwaking somnambulism. She replied : \"Sometimes I forget them quickly,\nsometimes remember them for an hour or two, never longer.\" When\nI reminded her that she had recalled one at the end of a month, she\nreplied, \" Oh, yes ! You made the suggestion just before I left your\nroom and I talked it over with my mother on the way home.\" Here\nthe recollection of the event was complicated by the patient's verbal\ndescription of it, and possibly by her mother's comments.\nWith another patient, I noticed a difference between the mental\nattitude in reference to hallucinations suggested in hypnosis and those\ncreated in waking somnambulism. This subject, a good somnambule, on\n\fPersonally observed Hypnotic Phenomena. 197\nseveral occasions, when hypnotised, saw by suggestion a hallucinatory\ncat. She was always delighted with the imaginary animal and evinced\ngreat pleasure in playing with it. At a later date, in the apparently\nwaking state, I successfully suggested a similar hallucination. The\npatient did not like it at all. She said, \" I see that cat, but I know\nit is not a real one, I know it is only an imaginary one which you\nhave made me see. I don't like this. I don't mind seeing the cat now,\nbecause I know you have done it as an experiment and will blot it out\nagain. But if I commence to see cats when I am by myself, I shall be\nhorribly frightened.\"\nSo-called Hypnotic Automatism.\nWhen I first visited Nancy in 1891, Dr. Li\u00e9beault showed me one\nof his subjects, called Camille, who had been frequently hypnotised,\nand whom he regarded as a typical specimen of deep somnambulism\nillustrating hypnotic automatism in its highest degree. He assured\nme that the suggestions he made to her were carried out with the\nfatality of a falling stone. He hypnotised her, and suggested that\non awaking she should find, on opening the outer door, that there was\na violent snow storm ; that she should at once return, complain of this,\nand proceed to the stove to warm herself. While so doing one of her\nhands would touch the stove and be burnt. It was a warm summer's\nday, and of course the stove had not been lighted. The patient\nrefused to accept the suggestion. Dr. Li\u00e9beault insisted for some time\nand then gave up the attempt, saying that she sometimes refused\nsuggestions. He then asked her, \" Will you do this another time if you\nwill not do it to-day ? \" She replied, \"Yes, to-morrow.\" On the follow\ning day the suggestion was repeated and carried out in all its details.\nMiss C., aged 19, an uneducated girl, had been frequently hyp\nnotised by me and was a good somnambule. She suffered greatly from\nher teeth, of which she had only sixteen left, all decayed. These were\nextracted at Leeds in the presence of 60 medical men and dental\nsurgeons. Anaesthesia was produced by written suggestion, while I\nremained in another room. The operation was perfectly successful and\nunattended by the slightest pain either then or afterwards. At a later\ndate I examined her mouth and found that a fragment of one of the\nstumps remained. I told her to come to my house to have it\nremoved. She mentioned this to one of her neighbours, an old woman,\nwho advised her to have no more teeth extracted, as it would cause\nher mouth to fall in. The following day she presented herself and was\nat once hypnotised, but refused to open her mouth, or to permit me to\nextract the tooth. Emphatic suggestion continued for half-an-hour\nproduced no result. This was the first occasion on which she had\nrefused a suggestion. I then awoke her and asked her why she refused\n\f198 Dr. J. Milne Bramwell.\nto have the tooth extracted. She told me what her neighbour had\nsaid, and expressed her determination to have nothing more done. I\nexplained the absurdity of this, and pointed out that, as she had only\nthe fragment of one tooth remaining, its removal could not affect the\nappearance of her face. As she was still obstinate, I said, \" Unless\nthis fragment is removed you cannot have your artificial teeth fitted.\"\nThis argument was sufficient. She gave her consent in the waking\ncondition, was at once hypnotised and operated on without pain.\nMiss D., aged 20, was a good somnambule who had been the\nsubject of two painless operations. At a much later date I wished\nto satisfy myself of the depth of the hypnotic an\u00absthesia, as another\nand more serious operation was contemplated. I obtained her consent\nto test the condition, hypnotised her and pricked the pulp of the\nthumb deeply with a needle, and also pinched her arm severely. She\nshowed no sign of pain, and remembered nothing afterwards of what\nhad occurred. A few days afterwards I wished to repeat the process.\nShe again permitted me to prick the thumb, but when I attempted\nto pinch her arm she drew it away and refused to let me touch it.\nHer mother, who was present, gave the following explanation. After\nthe first experiment her daughter noticed that her arm was blackened\nin several places and asked the cause. She told the girl what I had\ndone, whereupon she said, \"I don't object to being pricked with a\nneedle, but I won't allow Dr. Bramwell to pinch my arm again,\nbecause the neighbours might notice the marks.\" On both occasions\nher arm was covered, and I did not know it had been marked. I\nawoke the patient. She had no recollection of what she had said and\ndone. I told her she had refused to let me pinch her arm, and asked\nthe reason. She laughed and gave me the same explanation as\nher mother had done. One day when I had hypnotised this patient,\nher mother said to me, \" Ask her what she did on a certain occasion.\"\nI questioned her, but could obtain no response. I afterwards learnt\nwhat she had done. It was something which the mother regarded as\na joke, but which was slightly indelicate. Many persons, even fairly\nrefined ones, would have told this without blushing, but one of the\npatient's characteristics was an extreme prudishness.\nMiss E. had been frequently hypnotised, and was a good somnam\nbule in whom anaesthesia could be easily induced. She was maid to\none of my patients, a chronic invalid, whose house was managed by a\nsister of uncertain temper. On one occasion, when I had hypnotised\nE., her mistress requested that I would ask her what had been said to\nher by this sister. A quarrel had taken place, of a somewhat amusing\nnature, and my patient wished to hear E.'s account of it in hypnosis ;\nbut, despite energetic suggestions, she absolutely refused to say a word\non the subject.\n\fPersonally observed Hypnotic Phenomena. 199\nMiss F., aged 19, in good health, intelligent and well-educated.\nThis subject was a very good somnambule, in whom anaesthesia and\nother phenomena of deepest hypnosis could be easily induced. She\nhad a bad memory for words, and was also extremely shy in reading,\nsinging, or playing before others. I suggested to her that she should\nrecite to me on awaking some verses with which she was unacquainted,\nand which I had read twice to her when asleep. Shortly after\nawaking, she repeated them with very few mistakes and without\napparent embarrassment. Her mother assured me that under ordinary\nconditions this feat of memory would have been entirely beyond her\npower, and that nothing would have induced her to read or recite\nbefore me. On another occasion, her mother asked me to suggest to\nher during hypnosis that on awaking she should go to the side\nboard in my dining room, pour out a glass of water, and drink\nit. This suggestion was not carried out, and was the first which\nhad not been fulfilled. I had taught her mother to hypnotise her\nand on returning home she did so, and questioned her about the\nsuggestion. She recalled it at once and gave the following reason\nfor not carrying it out, namely, that she did not know me well\nenough to help herself to a glass of water in my house without\nbeing asked.\nMr. G., aged 25, a shopkeeper. He had been frequently hypnotised\nfor medical and surgical purposes and was a good somnambule. On\none occasion I showed him at the York Medical Society. At the close\nof my lecture I was asked to give an example of changed personality\nby making this patient believe he was a dissenting minister preaching\na sermon. He refused to do this, and I was then asked to make him\nbelieve he was a hawker selling fish. This was also rejected, but he\naccepted the suggestion that he was Barnum and that the medical men\nwere wild beasts and proceeded to describe them, in his character of\nshowman, in a highly amusing manner. I afterwards tried to make\nhim accept the two first suggestions, but he invariably refused. On\none occasion, however, he accepted the suggestion that he should poison\na personal friend. The subject was in the alert stage of hypnosis with\nhis eyes open. I took a piece of sugar from the basin, and assured\nhim that it was a piece of arsenic sufficient to kill a dozen persons. I\nthen put it in a cup of tea and told him to give it to his friend to\ndrink. He at once did so. 1 asked him why he had poisoned his\nfriend and he replied in an unnaturally gruff voice, \" Oh, he has lived\nlong enough.\" Another young man who was present, also a good\nsomnambule, would carry out suggestions like those rejected by G.,\nbut refused to execute the fictitious murder. The explanation of the\nreason why some of these suggestions were accepted and others refused\nI hope to give in my next paper.\n\f200 Br. J. Milne Bramwell.\nThe patient who was the subject of the time experiments also\nrefused certain suggestions. These I will now relate, as well as her\nown description of her mental and physical condition during\nhypnosis. On one occasion, during hypnosis, I asked her to put her\nfingers to her nose at Mr. Barkworth. She laughed, and, despite\nrepeated suggestions, absolutely refused to do so. At a later date,\nin hypnosis, I asked her for an explanation. She told me she did\nnot want to and would give no other reason. On another occasion,\nduring hypnosis, I suggested that she should steal Mr. Barkworth's\nwatch. The watch was placed upon the table and Mr. Barkworth\nhid behind a screen. I told the patient that Mr. Barkworth had\ngone and had left his watch, that he was very absent-minded, would\nnever remember where he had left it, would never miss it, &c. ;\nsuggested that she should take it, no one would ever know, &c. I\nawoke the patient. She took no notice of the watch. I asked her,\n\"Where is Mr. Barkworth?\" \"Gone away.\" \"He has left his\nwatch, would you not like to take it ? \" The patient laughed and\nsaid, \" No, of course not.\" I rehypnotised her and asked, \" What\ndid I suggest to you a little while ago when you were asleep?\"\n\"That I should steal Mr. Barkworth's watch, that he was absent-\nminded, would never miss it, &c.\" \"Then why did you not do so?\"\n\" Because I did not want to.\" \"Was it because you were afraid of\nbeing found out?\" \" No, not at all, but because I knew it would be\nwrong.\"\nOn another occasion I again questioned her in hypnosis in reference\nto this suggested theft. I said, \" Did you recognise it was an experi\nment?\" \" Yes, perfectly.\" \" How did you know it was ? \" \"I can't tell\nyou, I only felt sure it was.\" On being pressed further, she said, \"Well,\nI knew you would never really ask me to do anything wrong.\" \" Well,\nthen, if you were quite certain in your own mind that it was only an\nexperiment, why did you not carry it out ? \" \" Because I did not wish\nto do what was wrong, even in jest.\" \" If then, I asked you to put a\nlump of sugar in some one's tea and told you it was arsenic, would you\ndo so?\" \"No, certainly not.\" \"Not even if you were quite certain\nthat it was only sugar ? \" \" No.\" \" Why ? \" \" Because I should be\npretending to commit a crime.\"\nI found with this patient, however, that, although she was able to\nrefuse a suggestion, she was unable to prevent its fulfilment after\nhaving accepted it. For instance, if I suggested to her in hypnosis\nthat she should place her hands together and lose the power of\nseparating them, she could reject the suggestion if she pleased. On the\nother hand, if she accepted the suggestion and placed her hands\ntogether, she was unable to separate them, even when encouraged to do\nso by the exercise of her own volition.\n\fPersonally observed Hypnotic Phenomena. 201\nIn reply to further questions in hypnosis, she said she felt sure she\ncould refuse any suggestion. That she felt she was herself, that she\nknew where she was and what she was doing. \" Are you the same\nperson asleep as awake?\" I asked. \"Yes,\" she replied, with a laugh.\nShe described the condition as a sort of losing herself and yet not\nlosing herself. She knew and heard all that was going on, and yet\nseemed to be taking no notice of it. When Mr. Barkworth was put en\nrapport with her she remembered his voice, which she had heard on a\nprevious occasion when not en rapport with him. She said she was\nresting all the time, and that nothing she did or thought tired her. I\nasked her what it felt like to have her arm made cataleptic by sugges\ntion. She replied, \" I did not feel frightened, but I felt startled. I\nthink it would surprise any one.\" \" When you awake and find your\narm still rigid, what do you feel then?\" \"I feel amused.\" \"When\nyou are sleeping here and no one is talking to you, do you ever think\nof anything?\" \"Yes! One day I was troubled about my dressmaking.\nMy employer was ill and I had more responsibility than usual. I had\na difficult piece of work to do and could not understand how it was to\nbe done. When asleep here I planned how I would do it and carried\nthis out successfully when I returned home. When I awoke I did not\nknow that I had done this ; the way out of the difficulty suddenly came\ninto my mind on my way home. I now remember planning while\nasleep what I carried out.\"\nOn one occasion, after being hypnotised, and when she was\napparently in the lethargic condition, she suddenly volunteered the\nstatement that her mother wished to speak to me. Shortly afterwards\nher mother came into the room. The patient was still asleep and no\nsuggestions of rapport were made. Her mother commenced to tell me\nabout a friend in whom she was interested, with a view to finding out\nwhether I thought hypnotic treatment would be of benefit in his case.\nThe patient suddenly joined in the conversation, and added some\nimportant details which her mother had forgotten. On awaking she\nremembered nothing in reference to this.\nOn another occasion, under similar circumstances, her mother\nquestioned me in reference to a trivial indisposition from which the\npatient was suffering, and asked me whether I thought she might give\nher a certain simple remedy. \"Upon this the patient commenced to\nlaugh, and recounted iu a highly amused manner an experiment of her\nmother's in domestic medicine, of which she had been the unfortunate\nvictim.\nI obtained the following account of the hypnotic condition from\nanother patient, an educated, intelligent woman. She said, \" When\nasleep I still feel that I am myself, and can think and reason just as\nwell as when I am awake. I could resist any suggestion if I wanted\n\f202 Br. J. Milne Bramwell.\nto do so. The sensation is a pleasant one, as if I were getting rested\nall over. I am not conscious of other sounds, except your voice. When\nyou are not talking to me the condition is generally a blank. At such\ntimes I occasionally, but rarely, think and sometimes spontaneously\nrecall the events of past hypnoses.\"\nAnother educated patient, a very good somnambule, described her\nstate in similar terms. She said, \" I feel a kind of restfulness which I\ndo not get in any other condition of life. I feel no fatigue. External\nsounds, other than your voice, I hear vaguely, as if in a dream, and\npay no attention to them. I still feel myself and can reason just as\nwell as if I were awake.\" When her arm is made stiff, this appears\nquite natural, as she recognises it is done as an experiment. She feels\ncertain she could refuse any suggestion which she disapproved of and\nwould not carry out an imaginary crime, even if she knew it was only\nan experiment. This patient readily accepted suggestions of\nanaesthesia and analgesia, and was unable to remember in the waking\nstate either painful sensations or tactile impressions. On being\nrehypnotised, however, though she could not recall any sensation of\npain, she was able to state where she had been pinched or pricked\nand to describe the tactile impressions associated with these operations.\nRapport.\nI have never observed any peculiar rapport between the subject\nand the operator, when direct and indirect suggestions in reference\nto this condition have been carefully excluded. I could always, how\never, readily induce the condition by suggestion.\nMethods of Awaking.\nI have never experienced any difficulty in terminating the hypnotic\ncondition. All that is required is to suggest during hypnosis that the\npatient shall awake at a given signal.\nBeinduction of Hypnosis.\nOnce genuine hypnosis has been obtained, the condition can be\nreproduced immediately at any subsequent time. It is only necessary\nto suggest during hypnosis that in future the patient shall pass into\nthat state when told to do so.\nSelf-Hypnosis.\nExcept in cases where hypnosis had been previously induced by\nothers, I have never met with an instance in which a subject had\nsucceeded in hypnotising himself. On the other hand, all hypnotic\nsubjects can be trained to do so, by suggestion in hypnosis. All that is\nnecessary is to suggest that they should fall asleep on looking at the\noperator's signature, or on counting up to five, or, indeed, in any\n\fPersonally observed Hypnotic Phenomena. 203\nother way which has been arranged. The subject then can hypnotise\nhimself at any time and also suggest the various phenomena which he\ndesires to obtain. He can, for example, place himself en rapport with\nhis dentist and have hi% teeth painlessly extracted. Some of my\npatients still possess and exercise this power, which was first suggested\nto them six years ago.\nMultiple Suggestions.\nNumerous suggestions can be carried out simultaneously by one\nand the same patient.\nThis fact is of considerable importance in reference to certain\nhypnotic theories, which are based upon the state of the attention.\nOne can suggest, for example, at the same time, paralysis of one arm\nand catalepsy of the other ; excited action of the special senses on\none side of the body and diminished or arrested on the other, &c.\nSuggestion in Disease.\nThe phenomena described so far have, with few exceptions, been\nthose induced in healthy subjects. The result of suggestion in disease,\nby far its most important field of action in my opinion, I cannot\ndescribe in detail before a non-medical audience. I may state, however,\nthat I have been able to confirm many of the observations reported\nfrom abroad. I have seen, for example, the removal of pain in various\ndiseases, and its prevention in operation ; the habit of sleep restored\nin those suffering from insomnia, and many functional diseases cured\nwhich had long resisted other forms of treatment ; obsessions and\npainful memories blotted out ; dipsomania, kleptomania, and other\nvicious habits corrected, and many functions of organic life, which were\nperformed imperfectly or painfully, restored to their normal condition.\nConclusion.\nIf I were asked in one word to describe the difference between the\nhypnotised and the non-hypnotised subject, I should say that it con\nsisted in the superiority of the former over the latter in his having\nacquired a far-reaching power over his own organism, which the other\ndoes not share. This view of the hypnotic state is not a novel one,\nand has already been ably described by Mr. Frederic Myers. In\naddition, I desire to emphasise the fact\u2014denied by some, half-heartedly\nconceded by others\u2014that this increased power carries with it no\npenalty, and implies no interference with volition ; and that the subject\ncan reject when asleep, as readily as when awake, all suggestions\nwhich are contrary to his moral sense.\n\f204 Dr. J. Milne Bramwell.\nII.\nWHAT IS HYPNOTISM?\nBy Dr. J. Milne Bramwell.\nThe answers to this question have been so numerous and conflicting\nthat it would be impossible, in the space at my disposal, to give even a\nbrief summary of them. I propose, therefore, only to draw your\nattention to some of the more important, and to consider these more\nespecially in reference to the theories of James Braid. Two points\nseem to me worthy of special notice :\u2014\n1. Apparently little of value has been discovered which can justly\nbe considered as supplementary to Braid's later work, while much has\nbeen lost through ignorance of his investigations.\n2. The theories of the mesmerists, which he so successfully\ncombatted, still apparently survive. There not only exist, as the\nquestions and statements of one of the audience at my last lecture\napparently indicate, frankly avowed believers in mesmerism, but, as\nwe shall see later, views that differ only in name from those of the\nmesmerists still crop up in strange and unexpected places.\nModern hypnotism undoubtedly owes its origin to mesmerism and,\nto understand its evolution, a clear conception of mesmeric theories is\nnecessary. The views of Esdaile may be regarded as a fair summary\nof them.\nEsdaile's Theory.\nEsdaile believed that mesmeric phenomena were due to the action\nof a vital curative fluid, or peculiar physical force, which, under certain\ncircumstances, could be transmitted from one animal to another.\nVarious inanimate objects, such as metals, crystals and magnets, were\nalso supposed to possess it, and to be capable of inducing and\nterminating the mesmeric state, and of exciting, arresting or modifying\nits phenomena. One metal, for example, would produce catalepsy,\nanother change this into paralysis ; a glass of water could be charged\nwith odyllic force by being breathed upon by the mesmeriser, etc.\nBraid's Theories.\nBraid explained hypnotic phenomena from two widely differing\nstandpoints; first regarding them as mainly physical in their origin, and\n\fWhat is Hypnotism ? 205\nthen, at a later date, as chiefly psychical. From the commencement,\nhowever, to the termination of his researches he held practically the\nsame view as to the origin of mesmeric phenomena. In many instances\nhe regarded the phenomena themselves as genuine, considering their\nexplanation only as erroneous. As the result of long and careful experi\nment, he claimed to have proved that the various mesmeric phenomena\ncould be excited when all their alleged causes had been carefully\neliminated, and also that the supposed exciting causes were non\neffective when the subjects were ignorant of their existence. The\nmarvels only appeared when the various physical stimuli were\nassociated with mental impressions, and were invariably absent when\nthese were excluded. An imitation magnet, for example, produced\nall the usual phenomena when the subject was told of its presence,\nwhile a real magnet produced nothing when the subject was unaware\nthat it had been brought in contact with him.\nBraid's Physical Theory.\nBraid held that mesmeric and hypnotic phenomena were due\nneither to volition on the part of the operator, nor to his possession of\nany mysterious force or fluid, but were mainly due to physical changes\nthat took place in the subject. These, which consisted in the\nexhaustion of certain nerve centres with resulting decrease in the\nfunctional activity of the central nervous system, arose from the\ncontinued monotonous stimulation of other nerves, e.g., those of the\neye by means of fixed gazing, those of the skin by passes with contact.\nAt this time (1843), Braid agreed with the mesmerists on one point,\nviz., that the mesmeric or hypnotic state could be induced without the\nsubject's knowledge. His belief in phrenology also had its analogy in\nmesmeric theory. Thus, Braid held that certain phenomena could\nbe induced by pressure upon sensitive points of the head, and the\nmesmerists believed that others could be excited by bringing various\ninanimate objects in contact with different parts of the body. At a\nlater date Braid abandoned his physical theory, and, with it, all belief\nin phrenology. To his psychical theory I will refer later ; meanwhile,\nI wish to call your attention to some other physical explanations of\nhypnotic phenomena.\nCharcot's Theory, or that of the SalpStriere School.\nAccording to this school, hypnosis is an artificially produced morbid\ncondition, characterised by certain chemical changes in the secretions\n^\u2014a neurosis only to be found in the hysterical. Women are more\neasily hypnotised than men ; children and old people are almost entirely\ninsusceptible.\n\f206 Dr. J. Milne Bramwell.\nHypnosis can be produced by purely physical means, such as\npressure on certain regions of the body ; and a person can be hypnotised,\nas it were, unknown to himself.\nThe hypnotic phenomena are divided into three different stages,\nwhich usually appear in regular sequence. These are induced and\nterminated by certain definite physical stimuli.\nHypnotism has so far not proved of much therapeutic value.\nThere is danger of provoking hysteria in trying to induce hypnosis.\nThere is a difference between suggestion in normal life and in\nhypnosis. The former is a physiological phenomenon, the latter a\npathological one. Suggestibility does not constitute hypnosis, it is\nonly one of its symptoms. There does not exist a single case in which\na somnambule has acted criminally under the influence of suggestion.\nThis theory has been strongly attacked, chiefly by the hypnotic\nobservers who belong to what is termed the Nancy School. To\ncommence with, they point out the insufficiency of the data upon which\nthe theory has been founded, and cite the confession of its own\nsupporters that only a dozen cases of true hypnosis have occurred in\nthe Salpetriere in ten years, and that a very large proportion of the\nexperiments were conducted on one subject, who had long been an\ninmate of that hospital. On the other hand, they call attention to the\nextended nature of their own observations and to the fact that their\nconclusions are drawn from the study of many thousand cases.\nIs Hypnosis a Morbid Condition which can only be Induced in the\nHysterical, ?\nThis question must, I think, be answered in the negative. Moll,\nin reference to Charcot's argument that hypnotism and hysteria are\nidentical, because the chemical character of certain secretions is similar\nin both, pointed out that Charcot's subjects all suffered from hysteria ;\nand that, as the phenomena which characterise waking life are readily\ninduced in hypnosis, Charcot easily created a complete type of\nhysteria by suggestion. It would be equally easy to suggest stammering\nin hypnosis, but one would not be justified, therefore, in characterising\nhypnosis as a condition of stammering.\nAgain, as the following statistics show, if the hysterical alone can\nbe hypnotised, over 90 per cent, of mankind apparently suffer from\nhysteria. Some years ago, Bernheim had already attempted to\nhypnotise 10,000 hospital patients with over 90 per cent, of successes,\nwhile \"Wetterstrand recently reported 6,500 cases with 105 failures.\nSchrenck-Notzing in his First International Statistics, published in\n1892, gave 8,705 cases by 15 observers in different countries, with 6 per\ncent, of failures. Mr. HughWingfield, when Demonstrator of Physiology\nat Cambridge, attempted to hypnotise over 170 men, all of whom, with\n\fWhat is Hypnotism ? 207\nthe exception of 18, were undergraduates. In about 80 per cent.,\nhypnosis was induced at the first attempt ; but as no second trial was\never made with the unsuccessful cases, these results undoubtedly\nunderstate the susceptibility. (See Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VI.,\np. 198.) Most of the undergraduates would be drawn from our public\nschools, and, if these do not always turn out good scholars, they cannot\nat least be accused of producing hysterical invalids. Braid stated that\nthe nervous and hysterical were the most difficult to hypnotise, while\nLiebeault found soldiers and sailors particularly easy to influence.\nGrossmann, of Berlin, recently asserted that hard-headed North\nGermans were very susceptible, and I observed that healthy Yorkshire\nfarm labourers made remarkably good subjects. Professor Forel told\nme that he had hypnotised nearly all his asylum warders ; that he\nselected these himself and certainly did not choose them from the ranks\nof the hysterical. In former times Esdaile's patients were stated to be\nhysterical. In reply to this, he said, \" I cannot possibly see how\nhysteria has got into my hospitals, where I never saw it before\u2014\ncoolies and felons not being at all nervous subjects. . . . As\nnatural hysteria may be supposed to be more powerful than imitation,\nI shall look with impatience for the announcement, in the Morning\nPost, that Mrs. Freake has been cured of her nervous headaches by the\nskilful application of hysteria, and that Lady Tantrum has had her\narm cut off while in a fit of hysterics, without knowing it. These\nshould be easy feats for our fashionable physicians and surgeons, as\nthey have the disease and antidote ready made to their hands, whereas\nit costs me and my assistants great trouble to make the coolies and\nprisoners of Bengal hysterical to the degree necessary to render them\ninsensible to the loss of their members.\"\nThese and similar facts apparently justify the statements of Forel\nand Moll that it is not the healthy but the hysterical who are the\nmost difficult to hypnotise. According to the former, \" every mentally\nhealthy man is naturally hypnotisable \" ; while the latter says, \" if we\ntake a pathological condition of the organism as necessary for hypnosis,\nwe shall be obliged to conclude that nearly everybody is not quite right\nin the head. . The mentally unsound, particularly idiots, are much\nmore difficult to hypnotise than the healthy. Intelligent people, and\nthose with strong wills, are more easily hypnotisable than the dull, the\nstupid, or the weak-willed.\"\nAre Women more Susceptible than Men 1\nAll observers, with the exception of those of the Salpetriere School,\nagree in stating that sex has little or no influence upon the suscepti\nbility to hypnosis. According to Liebeault, the difference between the\nsexes is rather less than 1 per cent. The majority of Esdaile's subjects\nP\n\f208 Dr. J. Milne Bramwell.\nwere men and, as we have seen, Mr. Wingfield was able to hypnotise\nabout 80 per cent, of the Cambridge undergraduates at the first\nattempt.\nAre Children and Old People Insusceptible ?\nWetterstrand found that all children from 3 or 4 to 15 years of age\ncould be influenced without exception. Dr. Berillon, out of 250 cases\nin children, hypnotised 80 per cent, at the first attempt. Li\u00e9beault\nalso found children peculiarly susceptible, and one of his statistical\ntables records 100 per cent of successes up to the age of 14. In adult\nlife, age apparently makes little difference. In the same table we find\nthat from the ages of 14 to 21 the failures were about 10 per cent.,\nand from 63 years and upwards about 13 per cent.\nCan Hypnosis be Induced by Mechanical Means alone 1\nThis question is answered by the Nancy School in the negative,\nand my own experience agrees with this. I know of no single\ninstance where hypnosis has followed the employment of mechanical\nmeans, when mental influences have been carefully excluded, and the\nsubjects have been absolutely ignorant of what was expected of them.\nNo one was ever hypnotised by looking at a lark-mirror, until Dr.\nLuys had borrowed this lure from the bird-catchers and invested it\nwith hypnotic power. On the other hand, any physical method will\nsucceed with a susceptible subject who knows what is expected of him.\nAre Hypnotic Phenomena divided into three Distinct Stages 1\nThe stages described by the Salpetriere School, as arising from\ndefinite physical stimuli, have never been noticed by other observers.\nAmongst the many hundred hypnotised subjects I have seen, none\nhave responded to the manipulations which produced such striking\nphenomona at the Salpetriere. On the other hand, I and many\nothers have found that we could easily evoke these stages by verbal\nsuggestion, and train the patients to manifest them at any given signal.\nThe condition, however, was always an artificial one.\nIs Hypnotism of little Therapeutic Value 1\nOn the one hand, we have the negative evidence of a few cases\nobserved at the Salpetriere, where experiment, not cure, seemed the main\nend. On the other, the positive evidence, drawn from many thousands\nof cases, where hypnotism has been successfully employed for the relief\nor cure of disease.\nIs Hypnotism Dangerous ?\nThe Salpetriere School answer this in the affirmative, asserting that\nhysterical symptoms have sometimes appeared after the attempted\n\fWhat is Hypnotism ? 209\ninduction of hypnosis. That such phenomena should occur with them\nis not surprising, when one considers the nature of the subjects and\ntheir surroundings, and the violent and startling methods sometimes\nresorted to. The slight accidents which they record have not occurred\nin other and more experienced hands. Professor Forel says :\u2014\n\"Li\u00e9beault, Bernheim, Wetterstrand, van Eeden, de Jong, Moll, I\nmyself, and the other followers of the Nancy School, declare\ncategorically that, although we have seen many thousands of hypnotised\npersons, we have never observed a single case of mental or bodily\nharm caused by hypnosis, but, on the contrary, have seen many\ncases of illness relieved or cured by it.\" This statement I can fully\nendorse, as I have never seen an unpleasant symptom, even of the\nmost trivial nature, follow the skilled induction of hypnosis.\nCan various Physical and Mental Phenomena be excited by the\nApplication, or near Presence, of certain Metals, Magnets, and other\nInanimate Objects ?\nHere, in the assertions of the Salpetriere School and their\nrefutation by that of Nancy, we have an exact counterpart of the\ncontroversy between Braid and the mesmerists. All the old errors, the\nresult of ignoring mental influences, are again revived. Medicines are\nagain alleged to exercise an influence from within sealed tubes. The\nphysical and mental conditions of one subject are stated to be\ntransferable to another, or even to an inanimate object. It is useless\nto enter into any arguments to refute these statements, for this would\nbe repeating the work of Braid. Indeed, in many instances their\nabsurdity renders argument unnecessary. For example, when a sealed\ntube containing laurel flower water was brought near a Jewish girl of\ndisorderly life, she adored the Virgin Mary. From this it might be\ninferred that different religious beliefs were represented by different\nnerve centres, and that these could be called into action by appropriate\nphysical stimuli. Should this be established, it could hardly fail to\nhave an important influence upon the character and direction of\nmissionary enterprise ! The chief apostle of these doctrines is Luys ;\nand considerable attention was drawn to them in England a few\nyears ago by popular articles in the daily papers and elsewhere.\nIndeed, the editor of a well-known medical journal thought them\nof sufficient importance to demand his writing a book in order to\ndisprove them. He apparently was ignorant of the fact that M.\nDujardin-Beaumetz, in 1888, reported to the Acad\u00e9mie de Meclecine\nthat Luys' experiments were conducted so carelessly as to rob them\nof all value, and that among students of hypnotism they are entirely\ndisregarded.\np 2\n\f210 Dr. J. Milne Bramwell.\nThe two remaining points, namely, the question of criminal sug\ngestion and that of suggestion in general in relation to hypnotism, I\nwill refer to in discussing the theories of the Nancy School.\nHeidenhain's Theory.\nAccording to Heidenhain, the phenomena of hypnotism owe their\norigin to the arrested activity of the ganglion-cells of the cerebral\ncortex. He holds that these higher centres are inhibited by the\nmonotonous stimulation of other nerves, e.g., by fixed gazing, passes,\netc., and that sensory impressions, which usually produce movements\nafter passing to the higher centres and evoking consciousness, now do\nso by passing directly to the motor centres. This is essentially a\n\" short-circuiting of nervous currents \" theory. Heidenhain regards the\nhypnotised subject as a pure automaton, who imitates movements made\nbefore him, but who is entirely unconscious of what he is doing. To\ncause him to move his arm, he says, the image of a moving arm must\npass before his retina, or an unconscious sensation of motion must be\ninduced through passive movement of his arm. The patient has no\nidea corresponding to the movements he makes ; the sensory impression\nleads to no conscious perception and to no voluntary movement, but\nsuffices to set up unconscious imitation. In reference to the playing\nof different parts by hypnotised subjects, Heidenhain says that it is a\nmistake to suppose that the subjects realise what they are doing : this\nis quite out of the question ; the hypnotised individual neither thinks\nnor knows anything about himself. Heidenhain holds that the fact\nof the hypnotised subject's forgetfulness of the sensations he has\nexperienced during hypnosis affords satisfactory evidence that these\nsensations were unconscious ones. This theory was first published in\n1880, and attracted considerable attention. It was accepted, for\nexample, by Professor McKendrick, of Glasgow, and re stated by him,\nin the last Edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, as giving a true\nand scientific explanation of the phenomena of so-called animal\nmagnetism.\nTo this explanation many objections may be urged, thus :\u2014\n(1) It is a mistake, as Gurney pointed out, to call the hypnotic\naction on the cortical functions inhibition, without stating explicitly\nthat the normal action of these functions in respect to motion is to a\nlarge extent inhibitory, and that the complete description of the\nmethod by which the automatic reflex responses are brought about, is\nthus \" inhibition of the inhibitory functions.\"\n(2) While giving an elaborate exposition of the theory of cerebral\ninhibition produced by peripheral stimulation, Heidenhain omits to\ntake into consideration the result of central stimulation by means of\n\fWhat is Hypnotism ? 211\nan idea or emotion. As hypnosis can be equally well induced in this\nway, we cannot accept Heidenhain's theory, as he wishes that we\nshould do, in substitution for that of \" dominant ideas.\" It cannot\njustly be considered as an alternative to it, as it is merely the physio\nlogical statement of psychical facts.\n(3) The theory itself is not a new one ; with the exception of a few\ndetails, it is essentially an imperfect reproduction of that of the late\nProfessor John Hughes Bennett, of Edinburgh, published in 1851.\nBut Bennett, as we shall see later, possessed a clearer view of the whole\nproblem and did not fall into the mistake of attempting to substitute\nthe physiological statement of psychical facts for the facts themselves.\n(4) Hypnosis can be induced, not only in the absence of monotonous\nperipheral stimulation, but even without any peripheral stimulation at\nall. At the present day it is usually evoked by central stimulation,\nwhich, in those who have been previously hypnotised, need not be\npersistently monotonous ; the single word \" Sleep \" being then sufficient\nto excite the condition. In such cases, the factor which Heidenhain\nregards as essential to the production of hypnotic phenomena, i.e.,\nmonotonous peripheral stimulation, is absent.\n(5) Instead of a hypnotised subject imitating a movement which\nhe sees and failing to perform one which is verbally suggested to\nhim, the reverse is actually the case. As a rule, the slightest verbal\nsuggestion is sufficient to induce the movements described by Heiden\nhain ; on the other hand, hypnotised subjects never copy movements\nmade before them unless they have been trained to do so. The\nimitative movements only take place, according to Moll, when the\nhypnotic subject is conscious of them, and knows that he is intended\nto make them. If they were unconscious reflexes, the subjects would\nimitate any person's movements, but they only imitate the one person\nwho exists for them, i.e., the experimenter, and him only when they\nknow he wishes them to do so. A clear idea of the movements to be\nmade is the first condition. When such experiments are often repeated,\nthe imitation may become automatic in later hypnoses, as happens in\nwaking life. At first, however, a clear idea is necessary ; but as we\nregard the cerebral cortex as the seat of ideas, and as there is no\nreason for shifting them to another part of the brain in hypnosis, so\nthere can be no doubt of the activity of the cerebral cortex.\n(6) According to Gurney, Heidenhain's only argument is based\nupon the subject's subsequent defect of memory ; he thus assumes, as\nhis sole test for present consciousness, the subsequent remembrance of\nits content. Yet, as Gurney says, if the reality of that test be granted,\nthe question whether a man was conscious when he read an article in\nthe Times, will depend on whether or not he receives a blow on the\nhead when he has finished it. Gurney further points out that there is\n\f212 Br. J. Milne Bramwell.\na more radical objection to all these arguments founded on subsequent\nloss of memory,\u2014the fact, namely, that memory is frequently present.\nBraid, for example, found that only some 10 per cent, of his subjects\nwere unable to recall the events of hypnosis, while Schrenck-Notzing's\nInternational Statistics of 8705 cases give 15 per cent. Again, if on\nwaking the act performed during hypnosis is forgotten, the lost\nmemory can be revived in subsequent hypnoses; and, finally, the\namnesia, which would otherwise follow deep hypnosis, can be entirely\nprevented by suggestion.\nMr. Ernest Hart's Theories.\nMr. Hart has also attempted to explain the phenomena of hypnotism\nfrom a physical standpoint. His theories in themselves demand little\nor no attention, as they are almost entirely unsupported by experi\nmental evidence. On the other hand, from his position as Editor of\nthe British Medical Journal, he has had exceptional opportunities of\nmaking them known to the medical profession. According to Mr.\nHart, the hypnotised subject \" is reduced more or less perfectly to the\nstate of a living automaton. The upper brain is more or less com\npletely, and more or less regularly, bloodless, its functions in abeyance,\nthe will is abolished, suspended, or enfeebled. A hypnotised subject\nwill perform unconsciously, under the influence of suggestion, acts\nwhich are dangerous to himself and others, and which are in them\nselves criminal\u2014so that he can be made to thieve, to commit arson, or\nto attempt violence.\" He summarises his views in the following\nsomewhat obscure sentence :\u2014\" We have already, I hope, succeeded\nin eliminating from our minds the false theory,\u2014the theory that is\nexperimentally proved to be false\u2014that the will, or the gestures, or\nthe magnetic or vital fluid of the operator is at all necessary for the\nabolition of the consciousness and the abeyance of the will of the\nsubject ; and we now see that ideas arising in the mind of the\nsubject are sufficient to influence the circulation in the brain of the\nperson operated on (!), and in such variations are adequate to produce\nsleep in the natural state, or artificially, by total deprivation, or by\nexcessive increase, or local aberration in the quantity or quality of the\nblood to produce coma and prolonged insensibility by pressure of the\nthumbs upon the carotid ; or hallucinations, dreams, and visions by\ndrugs, or by external stimulation of the nerves ; or to leave the\nconsciousness partially affected, and the person in whom sleep, coma,\nor hallucinations is produced, subject to the will of others and in\ncapable of exercising his own.\" (See \" Hypnotism and Humbug,\"\nNineteenth Century, January, 1892.)\nTo Mr. Hart's theories there are three objections.\n\fWhat is Hypnotism ? 213\n(1) It is doubtful whether any of the phenomena\u2014unconsciousness,\nautomatism, susceptibility to criminal suggestion,\u2014which he regards\nas characteristic of the hypnotic state, exist. The general question of\nconsciousness and automatism has already been referred to in dealing\nwith Heidenhain's theory ; that of criminal suggestion I propose to\ndiscuss more fully in connection with the views of Bernheim and\nothers. Meanwhile, I may state, as the result of seven years' hypnotic\nresearch, that I have failed, either at home or abroad, to discover a\nsingle instance in which the phenomena described by Mr. Hart have\noccurred.\n(2) The presence of cerebral anaemia in hypnosis is by no means\nestablished. The belief in its existence is an old one, which recent\ninvestigations have done much to discredit. Many years ago Carpenter\nsuggested it as a possible explanation of at least some hypnotic\nphenomena, and Hack Tuke also considered there was a partial spasm\nof the cerebral blood vessels in hypnosis. Heidenhain too at first\nsupposed that anaemia of the brain was the cause of hypnosis. He\nsoon gave up this opinion for several reasons : (a) He saw hypnosis\nappear in spite of the inhalation of nitrite of amyl, which causes\nhyperaemia of the brain, (b) The investigations of Forster discovered\nno change in the vessels at the back of the eye during hypnosis, (c)\nSalviole and Bouchut found cerebral hyperaemia during hypnosis.\n(3) Granting that cerebral anaemia exists, to assume that it explains\nthe phenomena of hypnosis is unscientific. For, as Professor William\nJames points out, the change in the circulation is the result, not the\ncause, of the altered activity of the nervous matter. Many popular\nwriters, he says, talk as if it were the other way about, and as if mental\nactivity were due to the afflux of blood. That belief has no\nphysiological foundation whatever ; it is even directly opposed to all\nthat we know of cell life. The stomach does not digest because more\nblood flows into it, nor do the muscles of the arm contract for a similar\nreason ; on the contrary, their increased blood supply follows their\nincreased functional activity.\nHypnosis in Animals.\nMr. Hart believes that animals, such as guinea-pigs, rabbits, frogs,\nbirds, crayfish, and even young alligators can be hypnotised by\nmethods similar to those employed with the human subject, and that\nthey present like phenomena. The only argument in favour of this is\ndrawn from the fact that these animals, after certain physical stimuli\nhave been applied to them, present the phenomenon of catalepsy. Is\nthis catalepsy invariably a genuine one ? I am inclined to think that\nin many instances it is a conscious simulation of death, adopted by the\nanimal from the instinctive knowledge of the fact that certain birds and\n\f214 Dr. J. Milne Bramwell.\nbeasts of prey, except under pressure of extreme hunger, will not attack\nwhat is dead. If, for example, you turn a beetle over on its back it\nwill remain motionless and apparently cataleptic, with its legs sticking\nrigidly in the air. The moment you turn away, however, it scrambles\nto its feet and resumes its journey. Here death or catalepsy was in\nall probability only shammed, and doubtless the insect was keenly\nwatching your every movement and anxiously waiting for your\ndeparture. Again, catalepsy is only one, and a comparatively\nunimportant, phenomenon of hypnosis. One of the main characteristics\nof the hypnotic state is the rapidity with which one phenomenon can\nbe changed into its opposite. Have we any evidence of this in the\nso-called hypnosis of animals 1 I think not. Again, is it logical to\nconclude similarity of cause from identity of effect 1 In order to induce\nhypnotic catalepsy in the human subject, a clear idea of the suggested\nact is necessary. What evidence have we for concluding that a cray\nfish becomes cataleptic from a clear idea that the operator has suggested\nthis condition ? It is possible that in some instances the phenomenon\nis genuine, and then, according to Preyer, the condition is one of\nparalysis resulting from fright. Now fear is not necessary for the\ninduction of hypnosis ; and, before concluding that the condition is a\nhypnotic one, it would be wise to exclude this factor from the equation.\nTo do this experimentally would not be difficult ; it would only be\nnecessary to get rid of the disproportion between the size and strength\nof the operator and the animal, a disproportion which, in the experi\nments referred to, has always existed in favour of the hypnotiser.\nInstead of a young alligator, let one of greater age and larger growth\nbe chosen and the experiment repeated. I am inclined to think that\nin such a case the roles would be reversed, the operator would become\ncataleptic and the subject uncommonly and disagreeably mobile.\nAgain, Mr. Hart holds that hypnosis can be induced only in the\nhysterical, in those possessing ill-balanced nervous systems. What\nevidence have we for the existence of hysteria in the alligator 1 I\nthink none, and yet the spectacle of an alligator executing \" grands\nmouvements\" or even \"mouvements passionnels \" would have been\ncertain to have attracted attention.\nBraid's Later or Psychical Theory.\nAccording to this theory the hypnotic condition was essentially one\nof mental concentration or monoideism, in which the mind was so\nengrossed with a single idea as to render it dead to all other influences.\nAll the phenomena, no matter how hypnosis was induced, resulted\nentirely from dominant ideas aroused in the minds of the subjects.\nThe attention was concentrated upon the particular function called\ninto action, while the others passed into a state of torpor. Only one\n\fWhat is Hypnotism ? 215\nfunction was active at any one time, and hence intensely so. The\narousing of any dormant function was equivalent to superseding the\none in action.\nIn his earlier theories Braid attached most importance to the\nphysiological changes associated with hypnosis ; in his later, to the\npsychological ones. He never entirely separated the two, however ;\nand when he explained the condition by means of monoideism, he still\nclearly stated that this depended upon a definite physical change in\nthe subject. This resulted from the methods employed to induce\nhypnosis, and alone rendered the mental condition possible. In his\nlater works he gives no further elaboration of his physical theory and\nfor this we must turn to Professor John Hughes Bennett, who adopted\nBraid's view in reference to monoideism, and explained it both from\nthe physiological and psychological side.\nBennett's Physiological Theory.\nAccording to Bennett, hypnosis was characterised by alterations in\nthe functional activity of the nerve tubes of the white matter of the\ncerebral lobes. He suggested that a certain proportion of these\nbecame paralysed through continued monotonous stimulation, while\nthe action of others was consequently exalted. As these tubes, \"fibres\nof association \" as they have been called, connect the cerebral ganglion-\ncells, suspension of their functions was assumed to bring with it\ninterruption of the connection between the ganglion-cells.\nBennett's Psychical Theory.\nFrom the psychical side, he explained the phenomena of hypnosis by\nthe action of predominant and unchecked ideas. These were able to\nobtain prominence from the fact that other ideas, which under ordinary\ncircumstances would have controlled their development, did not arise ;\nbecause the portion of the brain with which they were associated had\nits action temporarily suspended, i.e., the connection between the\nganglion-cells was broken, owing to the interrupted connection\nbetween the fibres of association. Thus, he says, the remembrance of\na sensation can always be called up by the brain ; but, under ordinary\ncircumstances, from the exercise of judgment, comparison, and other\nmental faculties, we know it is only a remembrance. When these\nfaculties are exhausted, the suggested idea predominates and the\nindividual believes in its reality. In this manner we attribute to the\nfaculties of the mind as a whole a certain power of correcting the\nfallacies which each one of them is liable to fall into, in the same\nway that the illusions of . one sense are capable of being detected by\nthe healthy use of other senses. There are illusions, mental and\n\f216 Dr. J. Milne Bramwell.\nsensorial ; the former caused by predominant ideas and corrected by\nproper reasoning ; the latter caused by perversion of one sense and\ncorrected by the right application of the others.\nIn hypnosis, then, according to this theory, a suggested idea\nobtained prominence and created mental and sensorial illusions, because\nthe check action\u2014the inhibitory power\u2014of certain higher centres had\nbeen temporarily suspended. These theories were first published by\nProfessor Bennett in 1851.\nIf we confine ourselves entirely to the psychological side of this\nconception of hypnosis, we find an almost identical picture of the\ncondition presented by certain later observers, such as Gurney and\nBernheim.\nGurney's Theory.\nAfter referring to the certain and isolated way in which suggestion\nevokes a particular idea in the mind of the subject, Gurney states that\nthis isolation of a single object in the mind naturally implies abeyance\nof the normal controlling and relating powers. In the normal state,\nhe says, successive vivid points of consciousness are surrounded by a\nswarm of subordinate perceptions and ideas, by reference to which\nconduct is instinctively or subconsciously kept rational. In the\nhypnotic state the contact is broken between the predominant idea and\nthis attendant swarm ; and conduct thus ceases to have reference to\nanything except the predominant idea. The hypnotic mind is working\nwith marked absence of individuality in the channel chosen by others;\nand what its owner says or does, in response to external influence, is\nthat on which his attention is concentrated to the complete exclusion\nof every other thought.\nBernheim's Theory.\nIn hypnosis, according to Bernheim, the whole nervous force of the\nsubject is concentrated upon a single idea. This nervous concentration\nmay be changed from one point to another in response to the sugges\ntions of the operator, but, though the focus shifts its place, the same\nconcentration continues to exist.\nIn the normal state, he says, we are subject to errors, illusions and\nhallucinations. Sometimes these are spontaneous, or follow imperfect\nsensorial impressions; at others they are suggested to us, and accepted\nwithout being challenged. In the normal state there is a tendency to\naccept ideas suggested by others and to act upon them ; but every\nformulated idea is questioned and, as the result of this, either accepted\nor rejected. In the hypnotised subject, on the other hand, there exists\na peculiar aptitude for transforming the suggested idea into an act.\nThis is so quickly accomplished that the intellectual inhibition has not\ntime to prevent it, and, when it comes into play, it does so too late, as\n\fWhat is Hypnotism ? 217\nthe idea has been translated into its physical equivalent. If conscious\nness follows the suggested act, it at all events follows it too late to\ninterfere with its fulfilment.\nWhile Bernheim almost exactly reproduces the views of Braid and\nBennett in reference to the general mental condition in hypnosis, he\nand certain other members of the Nancy School differ from them in\nmany important points, and to these I now propose to call your\nattention.\nPoints of Difference.\nBraid and Bennett, as we have seen, regarded the phenomena of\nhypnosis as the result of a definite physical change in the subject ;\nBernheim, on the other hand, attempts to explain them (1) by finding\nan analogy between them and the phenomena of the normal state, and\n(2) by means of suggestion.\nAccording to Bernheim, hypnotic phenomena are analogous to\nmany normal acts of an automatic, involuntary and unconscious nature,\nand nothing, absolutely nothing, differentiates natural and artificial\nsleep. If any distinction exists at all between the normal and the\nhypnotic state, this can be explained by means of suggestion. Both\nthe normal and the hypnotised subject can be influenced by it; but, as\nwe have suggested to the latter that he should become more responsive,\na peculiar aptitude for transforming the idea into an act has in this\nway been artificially developed. In other words, every one is suggestible\nand ifyou take some one and suggest to him to become more suggestible,\nthat is hypnotism ! Thus, suggestion not only excites the phenomena\nof hypnosis, bnt also explains them. Suggestion, i.e., the mental\nimpression, including the preliminary suggestion to become more\nsuggestible, conveyed from the operator to the subject, is the only\nessential factor in the equation, and the condition of the patient,\nphysical or mental, is absolutely unimportant.\nThis theory contains five distinct statements, none of which can\nbe accepted without discussion.\nI. Nothing differentiates natural and artificial sleep. Hypnotic\nphenomena are analogous to many normal acts of an automatic,\ninvoluntary and unconscious nature.\nII. An idea has a tendency to generate its actuality.\nIII. In the hypnotic state, this tendency to accept suggestions is\nsomewhat increased by the action of suggestion itself. Such increased\nsuggestibility, one of degree, not of kind, alone marks any difference\nbetween the hypnotic and normal state,\nIV. The result of suggestion in hypnosis is analogous to the result\nof suggestion in the normal state.\n\f218 Dr. J. Milne Brarawell.\nV. In the four preceding propositions is to be found a complete\nexplanation of hypnosis and its phenomena.\nIn discussing the above propositions, I will, for convenience' sake,\nsomewhat change their order.\n\/.\u2014Explanation of Hypnosis by means of a supposed General Analogy\nbetween it and the Normal State.\nMy chief objections to this are :\u2014\n(1.) That an analogy, however successfully established between two\nsets of phenomena, by no means explains either of them.\n(2.) That the automatic, involuntary and unconscious acts, in which\nBernheim seeks to find his analogy, rarely, if ever, occur in hypnosis,\nand are certainly by no means characteristic of it.\nPutting aside the question of automatism, which I shall discuss\nlater in conjunction with suggested crimes, we find that Bernheim\nbelieves that a complete analogy exists between the therapeutic action\nof hypnosis in his hospital and the miracle cures at Lourdes. How far\nthese and similar phenomena resemble each other can, however, be\nbetter dealt with under the head of suggestion.\nBraid considered that marked differences existed between hypnosis\non the one hand, and natural somnambulism and the normal sleeping\nand waking states on the other. A detailed account of these, which,\nhe thought, consisted mainly in the increased mental and physical\npowers of the hypnotised subject, is to be found in the article on\nBraid in Part XXX. of the Proceedings of this Society (p. 127).\nIII.\u2014In Hypnosis the Tendency to accept Suggestions is somewhat\nincreased by the Action of Suggestion itself; this alone\ndistinguishes the Hypnotic from the Normal Stale.\nGranting for the moment that the normal and hypnotic states are\nidentical ; that both are characterised by susceptibility to suggestion,\nhow far are we justified in concluding that increased suggestibility is\nalone possessed by the hypnotic subject and affords the only difference\nwhich distinguishes him from the normal one? Let us consider the means\nby which the supposed change has been brought about. The phrase, \"You\nare to become more suggestible,\" is stated to have artificially created\nit. Now, if we admit that this formula is sufficient to change a normal\ninto a hypnotic subject and to account for his increased suggestibility,\nwe must be prepared to show, in order to maintain the distinction\nbetween the two, that the individual who is still regarded as normal,\ni.e., less suggestible, has escaped similar influences. Suggestions in\nnormal life, however, are frequently associated with those of increased\nsuggestibility. A beggar, in appealing for alms, not only asks that\nthey should be given him, but also suggests in various ways, directly or\n\fWhat is Hypnotism ? 219\nindirectly, according to his skill and ingenuity, that the object of his\npetition should become more responsive to his prayer, i.e., more sugges\ntible. There is an important difference between the two. In hypnosis\n.we attempt to gain increased power by quietly repeating some recog\nnised formula once or twice, while in normal life we attempt to obtain\nit in a much more forcible and varied manner. We must conclude,\nthen, that, if the hypnotic and normal states are identical and sugges\ntion a factor common to both, suggestibility, as the result of the\nmethods employed to develop it, ought to be more markedly character\nistic of the normal than of the hypnotic condition.\nIV.\u2014The Result of Suggestion in Hypnosis is analogous to the Result\nof Suggestion in the Normal State.\nIf we confine ourselves to cases in which suggestion in the normal\nsubject has been employed in the same manner as it is used in hypnosis,\nthe analogy is at once seen to be an extremely imperfect one. The cold\nblooded results of the action of the mind upon the body, as Mr. Myers\ncalls them, are extremely rare and generally unimportant. On the\nother hand, if we turn to the effects of violent emotional states, we find\nmany phenomena have been produced by them which more or less closely\nresemble the phenomena of hypnosis. Similarity of result, however,\ndoes not necessarily imply identity of cause, and an attempted analogy,\nwhich is based solely on the former and ignores the latter, must ever be\nan imperfect one. Fear, hope, faith, or intense religious excitement is\nalmost invariably present in cases which are cited as analogous to\nhypnotic ones. Not only are these conditions unnecessary for the\ninduction of hypnosis, but some of them absolutely preclude its pro\nduction. Thus, hypnosis can be evoked in the absence of all those\nconditions that are essential for the production of analogous phenomena\nin the normal state ; and, further, the presence of some of these\nconditions, instead of favouring hypnosis, hinders or prevents it.\nPutting aside this important objection\u2014the difference between the\nconditions associated with the development of the phenomena\u2014there\nstill remain certain points of contrast between the phenomena them\nselves, which I shall now enumerate.\nSuggestion in Hypnosis.\n1. Once hypnosis has been induced, a wide range of phenomena,\nboth mental and physical, can be evoked at any time, and, with the\nconsent of the subject, by any one. A considerable number of\nphenomena can be simultaneously produced in the same subject.\n2. One phenomenon can be immediately changed into its opposite,\ne.g., muscular rigidity into paralysis, anaesthesia into hyperesthesia, etc.\n3. Hypnotic phenomena can be terminated at will.\n\f220 Dr. J. Milne Bramwell.\n4. The date of the appearance of the phenomenon can be delayed,\ne.g., it can be suggested during hypnosis that it shall not appear till\ntwelve months afterwards.\n5. The suggestion will invariably be responded to, subject to two\nimportant limitations, i.e., that it contains nothing in opposition to the\npatient's moral sense and is not beyond the range of his hypnotic\npowers.\n6. Under the conditions just mentioned, the exact nature of the\nresponse can be predicted, i.e., similar stimuli produce identical results.\n7. Hypnotic suggestion tends to gain strength by repetition.\n8. Patients who readily respond to suggestions when hypnotised\nare frequently the very subjects who have for years resisted suggestion\nin the normal condition, even when this has been associated with\nemotional states. For example, a patient who had long suffered from\ndipsomania received many and varied suggestions in the normal state.\nThe grief of his friends and relatives and their repeated remonstrances\nwere powerful suggestions. So, too, were the loss of fortune and self-\nrespect, and the physical sufferings, associated with keen remorse, which\nfollowed his drinking bouts. Twelve months passed in a home for\ninebriates must also have been full of suggestion of many kinds. All\nthese, however, produced no result ; and yet, after a few weeks' hypnotic\ntreatment, the patient abandoned the alcoholic habit and still, after\nthe lapse of six years, remains an abstainer.\nSuggestion by Means of Emotional States.\n1. The resultant phenomena are usually isolated ones or, at all\nevents, much more limited in number than those which can simul\ntaneously be evoked in the hypnotised subject.\n2. One phenomenon cannot be immediately changed into its\nopposite, without an alteration in the emotional state which had\nproduced it.\n3. Emotional phenomena cannot be terminated at will.\n4. The date of the appearance of the phenomena can rarely be\ndelayed and fixed.\n5 The phenomena are evoked with less certainty than in hypnosis.\nAn emotional state which will produce a physical effect in one subject\nwill produce nothing in another.\n6. The result of identical emotional states is not similar physical\nphenomena. On the contrary, opposite conditions are frequently\nproduced in different subjects by identical emotions : e.g., fear will\nparalyse one, and excite violent muscular movements in another.\n7. An emotional suggestion frequently loses strength by repetition,\ne.g., a subject may rapidly come to disregard former fears.\n\fWhat is Hypnotism ? 221\n77.\u2014-An Idea has a Tendency to Generate its Actuality.\nAccording to Bernheim, the suggestive phenomena of hypnosis\ndepend upon the fact that, in the normal subject, an idea has a\ntendency to generate its actuality. This power, as we have seen, was\nsupposed, and erroneously so, to be artificially increased by suggestion\nin the hypnotised subject alone.\nNow, if we confined our attention to the hypnotic state and\nconsidered how frequently a suggested idea, unattended by emotional\nconditions, produced a rapid and definite response, we should be\ninclined to admit that in hypnosis an idea had not only a tendency to\ngenerate its actuality, but almost invariably did so.\nA similar statement, however, in reference to normal life cannot be\naccepted without question. If an extended statistical inquiry were\nmade as to the results of suggestion we should find that these would\nfall under three classes.\n1. Where the suggested idea had produced no result.\n2. Where the result was opposite, or, at all events, different from\nthat intended.\n3. Where the suggestion had been responded to with more or less\nexactitude.\n1. Where the Suggested Idea produced no Result.\nA very casual glance at the events of everyday life would compel\nus to conclude that this class is the commonest of the three. This is\nevident, if we think of the numberless things ineffectually suggested in\nthe family circle, to domestics, workmen, tradespeople, friends and\nacquaintances, county councillors, vestrymen, Members of Parliament,\nand even to the Prime Minister himself !\n2. Where the Result produced was Opposite, or, at all events, Different\nfrom that intended.\nIn point of numbers this class possibly comes second, but, in regard\nto the annoyance associated with it, it might be considered to stand first.\nNumerous examples can easily be cited. Thus, if a thief snatches my\nwatch from me, and I suggest to him to stop, he, on the contrary, runs\nthe faster. If a street arab is making a noise under my window and I\ntell him to cease and go away, he not only persists, but incites others\nto join him. If I suggest to a Liberal friend to become a Home Ruler,\nhe rejects the idea and joins the opposite party. If a servant asks for\na rise in wages, this frequently results in his dismissal.\n3. Where the Suggestion has been Responded to with more or less\nExactitude.\nWhen we compare the results of this class with those obtained in\nthe others they must, I am afraid, sink into insignificance. For one\n\f222 Dr. J. Milne Bramwell.\nsuggestion which has generated its actuality, we must count at least a\nhundred which have produced nothing, and possibly ten where the result\nhas been an unexpected or disagreeable one. I would therefore restate\nthe proposition as follows :\u2014\n1. A suggested idea has generally a tendency to generate nothing.\n2. A suggested idea has frequently a tendency to generate its\nopposite.\n3. A suggested idea rarely tends to generate its actuality.\nV.\u2014In the four preceding Propositions is to be found a complete\nExplanation of Hypnosis and its Phenomena.\nSo far we have been occupied in discussing the facts upon which\nBemheim's theoretical explanation of hypnosis is founded. To these\nexception has been taken on every point, viz :\u2014\nI. To the supposed analogy between the phenomena of hypnosis\nand automatic, involuntary and unconscious acts of normal life.\nIII. To the statement that suggestion increases suggestibility in the\nhypnotised subject alone.\nIV. To the general analogy between the result of suggestion in the\nnormal state and in hypnosis.\nII. To the general principle that, in normal life, an idea has a\ntendency to generate its actuality.\nOf all these statements there is only one I am prepared to accept,\nnamely, that suggestion plays an important part in evoking hypnotic\nphenomena. There remains for our consideration the question how far\nsuggestion explains the phenomena of hypnosis.\nI wish first, however, to refer to Braid's views regarding suggestion.\n\"While Braid held that hypnotic phenomena resulted from dominant\nideas in the mind of the subject, he, at the same time, stated that it\nwas a matter of indifference whether these had existed previously, or\nwere afterwards audibly suggested by the operator, or indirectly\ncreated by the sensory impressions resulting from his manipulations.\nSelf-suggestion,\nBraid cites many instances in which hypnosis and its phenomena\nwere entirely the result of self-suggestion, although they were supposed\nto be due to other causes.\nPasses and other Manipulations.\nAccording to Braid, everything which produces a new impression\nis capable of modifying existing functions, whether the impression be\nof a mental or physical nature. Hence he thought it possible that\npasses might have a physical effect through mechanical agitation of the\n\fWhat is Hypnotism ? 223\nair, by touch, or by producing some change in the temperature or\nelectrical states. In support of this, he drew attention to the fact\nthat physical impressions, too slight to arouse consciousness, might yet\nproduce potent results ; for example, although a person did not notice\nhe was sitting in a draught, this might cause rheumatism. He con\nsidered that physical methods acted most powerfully, however, when\nthey directly excited mental action, either by fixing the attention on\none part or function of the body and withdrawing it from others,\nor by arousing ideas previously associated with the physical impression.\nIn reference to the latter point, he says, this is simply an inversion of\nthe ordinary sequence between mental and muscular excitation.\nUnder ordinary circumstances the mental impression precedes and\nexcites the physical one, but here the order of events is reversed.\nThe touch calls into play the muscles constituting the \" anatomy of\nexpression \" of any given passion or emotion, idea or train of thought ;\nand, secondly, this physical expression suggests to the mind of the\nsubject the corresponding idea with which it has been previously\nassociated in the waking condition. Though Braid explained the\naction of passes in this way, he also drew attention to the fact that\ntheir effects might be neutralised or even reversed by direct suggestion.\nThus, he said, suppose the operator, while making the passes, spoke\naloud and predicted what would happen, the verbal suggestion might\nbe so strong as to cause the predicted manifestation to be realised\ninstead of what otherwise would have been the case ; and thus, from\nthis time forward, through the action of the hypnotic memory, a similar\nimpression on that part or organ of sense would recall the previously\nassociated idea and manifestation. Though Braid at first employed\npasses, dec., he almost entirely discarded these methods when he began\nto regard hypnotic phenomena from a psychical standpoint. He then\nstated distinctly that the value of mechanical means was purely\nsuggestive and that direct verbal suggestion was best for exciting the\nphenomena of hypnosis, whether experimental or therapeutic. His\nusual method was as follows : after hypnotising his patients, he stated\nin a confident manner the results he wished to obtain and, in certain\nsubjects, found that these could be varied by a simple change in the\nvoice. Thus, if he made a patient see an imaginary sheep, and then\nasked him in a cheerful manner what colour it was, this tone usually\nelicited the reply \"White,\" or some light colour. If he then asked,\n\"What colour is it now?\" giving a sad intonation to the word now,\nthe reply would usually be \" Black.\"\nThe difference between Braid and the Nancy School, with regard to\nsuggestion, is entirely one of theory, not of practice. Braid employed\nverbal suggestion in hypnosis just as constantly and just as intelligently\nas any member of the Nancy School, This fact is denied by Bernheim,\nQ\n\f224 Dr. J. Milne Bramwell.\nwho states that Braid did not dream of using verbal suggestion in\ntherapeutics ; but his statement has its sole origin in ignorance of\nBraid's later work and writings. Braid, however, while agreeing with\nBernheim as to the practical use of suggestion, differs entirely from him\nin his theoretical conception of it. He did not consider suggestion as\nexplanatory of hypnotic phenomena, but, like Mr. Myers at a later\ndate, regarded it simply as an artifice used in order to excite them.\nHe considered that the mental phenomena were only rendered possible\nby previous physical changes and, as the result of these, the operator\nwas enabled to act like an engineer and, by means of suggestion, to\nexcite and direct the forces which existed in the subject's own body.\nBefore discussing the general question of how far suggestion\nexplains hypnotic phenomena, I wish to draw attention to the\ndifference between the views of Braid and of Forel as regards passes.\nWhile Braid believed that the mental effect resulting from the indirect\nphysical action of mechanical means could be checked or reversed by\nstronger and more direct verbal suggestion, he still held, and I think\njustly so, that the physical impression was capable of producing both\nphysical and mental results. Forel, on the other hand, denies the\nphysical influence of mechanical processes, on the ground that\nsuggestion is capable of altering their supposed action. He says,\n\" blowing on the face no longer awakens my subjects, because I have\nsuggested that this would remove pain instead of arousing them.\"\nFrom this he concludes that the act of blowing produces no result, and\nconsiders this a powerful argument against the somatic school. Would\nit not be equally logical to contend that the prick of a pin produced\nno physical effect, because the patient, rendered insensible to pain by\nsuggestion, had been taught to regard the pin prick as the signal to\nevoke some other condition t\nDoes Suggestion explain Hypnosis and its Phenomena 1\nThe answer to this question must, I think, be a distinctly negative\none. The success of suggestion depends, not on the suggestion itself, but\non conditions inherent in the subject. These are (1) willingness to accept\nand carry out the suggestion, and (2) the power to do so. In the hyp\nnotised subject, except in reference to criminal or improper suggestions,\nthe first condition is generally present. The second varies according\nto the depth of the hypnosis and the personality of the patient. For\ninstance, I might suggest analgesia, in precisely similar terms, to three\nsubjects and yet obtain quite different results. One might become\nprofoundly analgesic, the second slightly so, and the third not at all.\nJust in the same way, if three jockeys attempt to make their horses\ngallop a certain distance in a given time, the suggestions conveyed by\nvoice, spur and whip may be similar, and yet the results quite different.\n\fWhat is Hypnotism ? 225\nOne horse, in response to suggestion, may easily cover the required\ndistance in the allotted time. It was both able and willing to perform\nthe feat The second, in response to somewhat increased suggestion,\nmay nearly do so. It was willing, but had not sufficient staying\npower. The third, able but unwilling, not only refuses to begin the\nrace, but bolts off in the contrary direction. \"With this horse, we have\nthe exact opposite of the result obtained in the first instance ; and yet\npossibly the amount of suggestion it received largely exceeded that\nadministered to the others. As Mr. Myers has pointed out, the\noperator directs the condition upon which hypnotic phenomena depend,\nbut does not create it. \" Professor Bernheim's command, ' Feel pain\nno more,' is no more a scientific instruction how not to feel pain,\nthan the prophet's ' Wash in Jordan and be clean ' was a pharmacopoeal\nprescription for leprosy.\" In hypnosis, the essential condition is not the\nmeans used to excite the phenomena, but the peculiar state which\nenables them to be evoked. Suggestion no more explains the phenomena\nof hypnotism than the crack of a pistol explains a boat race. Both are\nsimply signals, mere points of departure, and nothing more. In\nBernheim's hands, the word ''\u25a0 suggestion\" has acquired an entirely new\nsignification, and differs only in name from the odyllic force of the\nmesmerists. It has become mysterious and all-powerful, and is supposed\nto be capable, not only of evoking and explaining all the phenomena of\nhypnotism, but also of originating, nay even of being, the condition\nitself. According to his view, suggestion not only starts the race, but\nalso creates the rowers and builds the boat !\nAttention in Hypnosis.\nWhile Braid and Bernheim differ as to the physical changes which\nprecede or accompany hypnosis, they both attach much importance to\nthe question of attention in reference to the induction of hypnosis\nand of its phenomena.\nAttention in the Induction of Hypnosis.\nAccording to Braid, the induction of hypnosis was facilitated either\nby :\u2014(1) The concentration of the attention on some external object.\n(2) Concentration of the attention on some idea connected with\nhypnotism.\nLi\u00e9beault and Bernheim consider that ordinary and hypnotic sleep\nboth owe their origin to the fixation of the attention and of the nervous\nforce upon the idea of sleep. The individual who desires to go to sleep\nchooses a quiet place, meditates and keeps still. His nervous force is\nconcentrated upon a single idea and deserts the nerves of sensation,\nemotion and special sense. The conditions which induce the hypnotic\nstate are identical. The subject is told to concentrate his mind upon\nQ 2\nnit\n\f226 Dr. J. Milne Bramwell.\nthe idea of sleep and, to aid him in doing so, is directed to look fixedly\nat some object. From this results bodily repose, the senses become\nless acute, more and more isolated from the external world and, finally,\nthought is arrested.\nA connection undoubtedly exists between the subject's powers of\nattention and the facility with which hypnosis can be induced. For\nexample, idiots, who possess little spontaneous and no voluntary\nattention, cannot be hypnotised at all, and others, such as those suffer\ning from mania, hysteria, <fec., whose attention is actively turned into\nother channels, are extremely difficult to influence.\nIn reference to the connection between the attention and the\ninduction of hypnosis, the following points seem worthy of notice.\n1. It is not necessary that the attention should be concentrated on\nthe idea of sleep. Braid, as we have seen, easily induced hypnosis\nwhen the patient gazed steadily at an external object and concentrated\nthe attention on the idea of that object. The primary hypnosis also\nneed not resemble sleep, and the subject may at once pass into the alert\nstate with the eyes open.\n2. Primary hypnosis has sometimes been induced in cases where it\nwould be difficult to prove that any concentration of attention had\nexisted, either upon some external object or upon the idea of sleep.\nIn these cases, the subject, after having given his consent to the\nexperiment, has rested quietly and voluntarily reduced his mental\nactivity. He has, as nearly as possible, emptied his mind of all\nthought and produced, not a condition of concentration, but its\nopposite,\u2014abstraction.\n3. Again, as Gurney points out, the phenomena of natural\nsomnambulism, which, in respect to the absorption of the mind in\none direction, present the closest analogy to those of hypnotism,\ndemand no previous concentration of attention at all.\n4. Once hypnosis has been induced, the condition can be evoked at\nany time, and practically instantaneously, in response to a previously\narranged signal. Here, though the attention of the subject has\nbeen momentarily directed to the signal, prolonged concentration of\nattention has been absent.\nDoes Concentration of Attention cause Hypnosis ?\nGurney says :\u2014\" But, even if we confine ourselves to cases where\nattention is actually present during the production of the state, what\nground is there for describing it as the cause of that state ? . . .\nThe general effects of a one-sided strain of mind or body are pretty well\nknown and ' tonic cramp of the attention ' may be a very satisfactory\ndescription of the one-sided absorption in a particular direction which\n\fWhat is Hypnotism? 227\ncharacterises many isolated stages of hypnotic trance. But what\ntendency should the cramp of an attention, which is directed to a\nbutton held in the hand, have to produce, or to facilitate, a fresh\ncramp or series of cramps, when the attention is diverted to quite fresh\nobjects ? . . . I have again and again found the complete change\nto a new genus of ideas to be absolutely effortless and instantaneous\u2014\u25a0\nfound, that is, that the attention, which has been as usual fixed\nduring the process of hypnotisation, became quite abnormally mobile\nafterwards. . . . If I am told that a particular mental attitude,\u2014\nthat of fixed or one-sided attention\u2014is the cause of certain mental\nphenomena which are new to me, I am surely justified in demanding\nthat the order of events shall present some perceptible coherence\u2014shall\nat least not run directly counter to what my general experience would\nhave led me to expect.\" (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. II., pp. 271-3.)\nAgain, taking the case where the attention was concentrated\nduring the production of the state, how does this explain the fact\nthat when the patient is left to himself in hypnosis, his condition is\nusually one of abstraction 1 Here, as a supposed result of a previous\nconcentration of attention, we have the spontaneous development of\nits opposite.\nPreliminary fixation of attention cannot be accepted as an explana\ntion of subsequent mobility. All that we can concede so far is :\u2014(1)\nThat fixation of the attention frequently precedes and usually\nfacilitates the induction of hypnosis. (2) That the attention in\nhypnosis can easily be rendered excessively mobile.\nFurther Conditions favourable for the Induction of Hypnotic\nPhenomena.\nRapport and attention.\nThe following is Liebeault's view : \u2014\"It is observed,\" he says,\n\" that nearly all artificial somnainbules are in relation by their senses\nwith those who put them to sleep, but only with them. The subject\nhears everything the operator says to him, but hears him only, provided\nthe sleep is sufficiently deep. He only hears the operator when he is\naddressed directly by him and not when a third person is spoken to.\nThis rapport extends to the other senses.\" According to Liebeault,\nthe subject remains en rapport with the hypnotiser because he goes to\nsleep in thinking of him, and this does not differ from what sometimes\nhappens in ordinary sleep. A mother who goes to sleep close to the\ncradle of her child, does not cease to watch over him during her sleep,\nbut while she hears his slightest cry, is insensible to other louder\nsounds. The concentration of the subject's attention upon the\noperator, and his mental retention of the idea of the one who put him\nto sleep is the cause of rapport.\n\f228 Dr. J. Milne Bramwell.\nIn rapport Bernheim finds his solitary point of difference between\nnormal and hypnotic sleep. He says, \" In ordinary sleep, as soon as\nconsciousness is lost, the subject is only in relationship with himself ;\nin induced sleep his mind retains the memory of the person who has\nput him to sleep ; hence the hypnotiser's power of playing upon his\nimagination, of suggesting dreams, and of directing the acts which are\nno longer controlled by the weakened or absent will.\"\nThe following is Braid's view of the condition of the attention in\nhypnosis : \u2014\nThe principal difference between hypnotic and normal sleep is to be\nfound in the mental condition. \"When falling into ordinary sleep, the\nmind passes from one idea to another indifferently, and the subject is\nunable to fix his attention on any regular train of thought, or to\nperform any act requiring much voluntary effort. As the result of\nthis, audible suggestions and sensory impressions received by the\nsleeper, if not intense enough to entirely awaken him, seldom do more\nthan arouse dreams, in which ideas pass through his mind without\nexciting definite physical acts. On the other hand, the concentration\nof attention, which is the result of the means employed for inducing\nhypnosis, is continued into the state itself, and verbal suggestions or\nsensory impressions excite definite trains of thought or physical\nmovements, instead of dreams.\nCertain points of difference and resemblance are to be noticed\nbetween these views.\nAccording to Braid, the condition of the attention in hypnosis\nfavoured response to external suggestion, but not to suggestion\nconveyed by any particular person, such as the hypnotiser. It was\npossible by suggestion to create an artificial state in which the subject\nwas apparently only en rapport with the operator, but this condition\nwas only an apparent, not a real one. The subjects really heard the\nsuggestions of others, though special artifices might be necessary in\norder to make them respond to them. Braid relates a case in which he\nmade a somnambule respond to his indirect suggestions, conveyed in\nthe form of confident predictions of what was going to happen, though\nthe subject was asleep when he entered the room and apparently was\nonly en rapport with the original operator. Carpenter drew attention\nto the fact that rapport was unknown to Mesmer and his immediate\ndisciples and was not discovered until long after the practice of\nmesmerism had come into vogue. The phenomena of rapport only\nacquired constancy and fixity in proportion as its laws were\nannounced and received. Mesmerists, ignorant of it, produced a\ngreat variety of remarkable phenomena without discovering rapport,\nuntil the idea had been put into their minds and thence transferred\nto their subjects.\n\fWhat is Hypnotism ? 229\nBernheim and Li\u00e9beault believe that a real rapport exists between\nthe subject and the operator and that this follows as a natural con\nsequence from the methods employed in inducing hypnosis. According\nto Bernheim, not only does it exist, but the operator's power of evoking\nhypnotic phenomena depends on it. While Bernheim and Liebeault\nagree on this point, they differ on another. Thus, Bernheim finds in\nrapport the sole difference between hypnotic and ordinary sleep, while\nLiebeault, on the contrary, tries by means of it to establish an analogy\nbetween them.\nMy own observations in reference to rapport have led me to\nconclusions similar to those of Braid, viz. :\u20141. That rapport does not\nappear unless it has been directly or indirectly suggested. 2. That the\ncondition is always an apparent and never a real one. It could always\nbe experimentally proved that the subjects actually had been cognisant\nof what had been said and done by others who had not been placed en\nrapport with them. In those who did not know what was expected of\nthem, and to whom neither direct nor indirect suggestions of rapport\nwere made, this condition did not appear. On the contrary, they\nheard and obeyed any one who might address them.\nMoll, in Der Rapport in der Hypnose, published in 1892, comes\npractically to the same conclusion as Braid in regard to rapport, viz. : \u2014\nthat it is caused by direct or indirect suggestions of the operator, or by\nself-suggestions which result from the subject's conception of the nature\nof the hypnotic state.\nIt is true, as Liebeault has pointed out, that rapport frequently\nexists between the sleeping mother and her child and that she will hear\nits slightest cry and yet be unconscious of louder sounds. This, how\never, has no analogy in the hypnotic state. The untrained somnambule\nresponds with equal readiness to the voice of any one and, if he has\nbeen taught to respond only to one voice, he still hears others. Again,\nthe difference between hypnotic and normal sleep is not, as Bernheim\nsays, that rapport exists only in the former. On the contrary, we\nmight with justice establish a distinction between hypnotic and normal\nsleep on the ground that rapport is absent from the former and is a\nfrequently occurring phenomenon in the latter.\nAlterations in Volition. The so-called Automatism.\nSuggested Crimes.\nAccording to Braid's conception of hypnosis, the state was\ncharacterised by mental and physical phenomena which were not to\nbe found in other conditions. The hypnotised subject had acquired\nnew and varied powers, but had not at the same time lost his volition\nor moral sense. He asserted that he had proved that no one could be\naffected by hypnotism, at any stage of the process, unless by voluntary\n\f230 Dr. J. Milne Bramivell.\ncompliance. The subjects were docile and obliging ; but, despite this,\nthey refused all criminal suggestions and even developed a higher\nsense of propriety than characterised their normal condition.\nTotally different views are held by Bernheim and certain other\nmembers of the Nancy School. They believe that the subject's\nvolition is weakened or destroyed, and consider this condition to be\none of automatism. To both these points I wish to draw your\nattention.\nThe hypnotic state is described as one of cerebral automatism, and,\naccording to Bernheim, its phenomena find their analogy in various\nautomatic movements of normal life, such as walking. Suggested crimes,\nwhich, I think, differ essentially from acts like these, are described as\nillustrating automatism in its highest form. It is with the latter\nthat I desire to deal at present. Let us take a typical case. It is\nsuggested to a high-principled girl in the somnambulic state that\nshe shall take a piece of sugar from the basin and put it into her\nmother's tea-cup, after having been informed that this is really a\nlump of arsenic certain to cause death. Apart from the question\nwhether, in carrying out this suggestion, she has committed what\nshe believes to be a real crime, or knows that she has merely carried\nout an experiment, let us attempt to understand the supposed\nmental condition with regard to consciousness and volition, and then\ncompare it with the usual scientific conception of automatism. It\nis, I think, generally conceded by the Nancy School that hypnotic\nacts are conscious ones, and that, if amnesia follows on waking,\nthe lost memory can be restored in subsequent hypnoses. Indeed,\nProfessor Bernheim, in discussing the Salpetriere experiments, insists\nupon the fact that the hypnotised subject is conscious in all stages.\nThe alleged criminal act was, then, a conscious act. Again, we are told\nthat somnambules, before accepting criminal suggestions, frequently\nstruggle against them. This would indicate that, in some instances at\nall events, they are carried out in opposition to volition as it exists in\nhypnosis. Further, it must be conceded that a criminal act would not\nbe performed voluntarily by a virtuous person in the normal state. The\nsuggested act, then, is one which would have been opposed by volition\nin the waking state. Now, let us turn to automatism, as defined by\nProfessor Waller, the well-known physiologist. \" The word,\" he says,\n\" has received two diametrically opposed meanings, viz. (1) self-moving,\nself-arising, spontaneous, (2) automaton-like, that is to say, like a\nmechanism that appears to be self-moving, but that we know to be\nmoved by secret springs and hidden keys.\" The second sense is the\none in which he employs it, and is also, I think, the one now generally\nadopted by science. As the supposed essential characteristic of the\nsuggested crime is the fact that it arose, not spontaneously, but in\n\fWhat is Hypnotism ? 231\nresponse to the desires of the operator, it is obvious that if it be automatic\nat all, it must accord with the second conception of automatism. Now,\nlet us follow Dr. Waller in his further definition of the second condition\nand then see how this agrees with the so-called hypnotic automatism.\nAccording to him, the automatic action is essentially a reflex action, and\ndiffers from it only in that it is, as a rule, the habitual or serial effect\nof habitual or serial stimuli. An automatic act is the repeated or\nrhythmic motor response to a repeated or continuous excitation.\nUsually it is carried on unconsciously. Automatic actions are\ndistinguishable into two sub-groups : (1) Primary or inherited, of\nwhich the act of sucking is an example. (2) Secondary or acquired,\nof which walking is an example. In this discussion I think we may\ndisregard primary or inherited automatic acts. Obviously, to kill one's\nmother cannot be regarded as an inherited automatism, and, if\nsuch a crime be automatic at all, it must fall under the group of\nsecondary ones. Of this form of automatic act, the winding of\none's watch may be taken as a typical example. This is first performed\nconsciously and voluntarily. After a time consciousness ceases to\nparticipate in the action. On attempting to wind your watch, many of\nyou must have occasionally found that you had already done so,\nalthough quite incapable of recalling it. Now, this automatic act is\nsimply a voluntary one performed inattentively or unconsciously ; one\nthat has previously been frequently performed and possesses well-worn\nnerve channels. It has commenced as a conscious, voluntary one. It\nhas become unconscious by repetition, but still remains voluntary in the\nsense that it is an act which the consciousness would approve of did it\nhappen to participate in it. Let us consider the so-called automatic\ncrime of the hypnotised subject and see how it agrees with this concep\ntion of automatism. (1) The crime has not been an habitual one. In\nthe present instance the very nature of the act renders this impossible.\nObviously the subject could not have habitually killed her mother.\nThe alleged automatic act must, then, in this instance, have been\nperformed for the first time. Now the essential character of the\nsecondary or acquired automatic act is that it has previously been\nfrequently, consciously and voluntarily performed and possesses in con\nsequence well-worn nerve tracts, which offer no obstacle to its fulfilment.\n(2) The hypnotic act is performed consciously, and the attention,\ninstead of being directed into other channels, as in genuine automatism,\nis supposed to be intensely concentrated on the operator or on the\nsignal given by him, and this latter may be so faint that the subject is\nonly enabled to recognise it by means of the hypera;sthesia of his special\nsenses. (3) The hypnotic crime is sometimes supposed to be performed\nin opposition to volition as it exists in hypnosis, and is always supposed\nto be in opposition to the normal volition. The genuine automatic\n\f232 Dr. J. Milne Bramwett.\nact, on the other hand, has only been enabled to become automatic\nowing to the fact that it has previously been frequently performed as a\nvoluntary act ; and now, when performed unconsciously, it still remains\nsuch an act as the volition, as a general rule, would approve of. The\nso-called automatic crime of the hypnotised subject not only differs,\nthen, from the general scientific conception of automatism, but is its\nexact opposite in every detail.\nWhile holding, and holding strongly, that the hypnotic crimes\nwhich we are discussing cannot in any sense be termed automatic, I\ndo not deny that the hypnotic subject can be trained to perform\nautomatic acts. If I suggest some simple movement to a subject,\nwhich his volition does not disapprove of, doubtless after a time it may\nbe performed automatically, i.e., after having been frequently, volun\ntarily, and consciously performed, it may at length be executed\nunconsciously as a genuine automatic act in response to the habitual\nstimulus which has excited it.\nPutting aside all question of the correct conception of the word\nautomatism, or, perhaps better still, characterising the described\ncondition as one of obedience, I now desire to see how far the\nphenomenon so-called can be taken as the essential characteristic of the\nhypnotic state. The writings of the Nancy School indicate a belief\nthat the hypnotic state is essentially characterised by the obedience\nof the subject to the operator. Some years ago most stress was laid\nupon complete obedience, and Li\u00e9beault said, \" We may postulate, as\na first principle, that a subject during the state of magnetic sleep, is\nat the mercy of the hypnotiser.\" Now, possibly as the result of the\ninfluence of the late Professor Delboeuf, a greater power of resistance\nis conceded. In a recent article Dr. Li\u00e9beault admits that he has only\nencountered four to five per cent, of hypnotised subjects to whom one\ncould, with absolute certainty, suggest crime. This admission is an\nimportant one, but despite it, the so-called automatism is still regarded\nas the essential characteristic of the hypnotic state. If only four or\nfive out of a hundred subjects evince the so-called automatism, surely\none is not justified in describing this as the essential characteristic of\nthe whole group. If five out of a hundred unhypnotised individuals\npresented certain phenomena which were absent in the remainder, one\nwould surely not choose these rarely occurring phenomena as the\ndescriptive characteristics of the class, and those upon which the\nbelief in other and more frequently observed phenomena should\ndepend. Yet, strange as it may seem, this is the position assumed by\nDurand le Gros, who assured Delboeuf that if he succeeded in proving\nthat the suggested crimes of the Nancy school were recognised by the\nsubject as experimental ones, he would destroy hypnotism entirely.\nThe existence, then, of many undisputed phenomena, which are common\n\fWhat is Hypnotism ? 233\nto all hypnotic subjects, is to depend upon the acceptance of others\nwhich it is alleged occur in four or five per cent, alone out of the same\nnumber.\nPutting aside in its turn the question of the average number of\nsubjects in whom it is alleged crime can be successfully suggested, I\ndesire first to refer to some of my own experiments in this direction\nand afterwards to consider them in conjunction with the so-called\nsuggested crimes of Bernheim and others, in order to gain, or at all\nevents to strive after, a clearer conception of the mental states\ninvolved.\nWhen I commenced hypnotic work some seven years ago, I, like\nDelboeuf, believed that the hypnotic subject was entirely at the mercy\nof the operator. 1 was soon aroused from this dream, however, not by\nthe result of experiments made to test the condition, but from the\nconstantly recurring facts which spontaneously arose in opposition to my\npreconceived theories. In the paper printed above, under the heading\n\" So-called hypnotic automatism,\" I cited a number of cases in which\nsuggestions had been refused by hypnotic subjects. I also mentioned\ntwo subjects who had rejected certain suggestions and accepted others.\nMiss F., for example, recited a poem, but would not help herself to a\nglass of water from my sideboard, while Mr. G. would play one part,\nbut not others, and committed an imaginary crime.\nThese subjects accepted suggestions which were apparently in\nopposition to their normal character. For instance, Miss F., who was\nextremely nervous and shy about singing or reading aloud, not only\nbefore strangers, but also before certain members of her own family,\nrecited a poem in the waking state which I had read to her during\nhypnosis. Her mother told me that, under ordinary circumstances,\nshe would rather have died than have done so. While Mr. G., who\nrefused the r61es of dissenting minister and hawker, accepted that of\nshowman. He also, without the least hesitation, promptly put a piece\nof sugar in a friend's tea-cup, after having been assured it was arsenic.\nWhen asked why he had poisoned his friend, he replied, laughing, \" Oh,\nthat's all right, he has lived long enough ! \" I made no attempt to\nascertain G.'s mental condition in reference to the supposed crime, but\nI think one can, without much difficulty, imagine it. G. was a\nrespectable tradesman and a somewhat devout Dissenter, and it is not\nunnatural to suppose he refused the part of fish-hawker as this was\nnot in keeping with his social position, and that of minister as it\noffended his religious susceptibilities, and accepted that of showman\nbecause it contained nothing objectionable to him. Would it be\nreasonable to suppose that he should at the same time be capable of\nweighing fine distinctions between the suggested alterations in person\nality and unable to understand the experimental nature of the crime ?\n\f234 Dr. J. Milne Bramwell.\nHe, by the way, affords the only instance in which an imaginary crime\nhas been carried out by one of my own patients. All others, without\nexception, have absolutely refused such suggestions.\nWhy should Miss F. have recited the poem and refused to take a\nglass of water from my sideboard 1 The answer to the first question is\nobvious. She was extremely anxious to get rid of the nervous embar\nrassment from which she suffered and thus the suggestion contained\nnothing opposed to her volition. She herself explained the second ;\nafter leaving my house, her mother rehypnotised her and asked why she\nhad refused my suggestion, whereupon she replied, \" I do not know Dr.\nBramwell well enough to help myself unasked to a glass of water.\"\nIn the cases above recorded, although a certain amount of evidence\nwas obtained from the patients themselves in reference to their mental\ncondition, no systematic attempt was made to investigate this. I am\nwell aware that this admission is a startling one. I can only say in\nself-excuse that this all-important point has apparently been equally\nneglected by others. I have recently attempted to repair my mistake,\nand with interesting results. Some of these have been given in my former\npaper, and are to be found in the description of the mental condition\nof somnambules as revealed by the answers obtained to questions asked\nduring hypnosis. One of them, the subject of the time experiments,\nsaid she would not put a piece of sugar in any one's tea if she were told\nit was arsenic. At a later date, when Mr. Myers was present, she\ngave a different answer. She said, \" I would not take a watch, even if\nI knew the suggestion was made as an experiment, because this would\nbe pretending to commit a crime. I would, however, put a piece of\nsugar in a friend's tea-cup, if I were sure it was sugar, even though\nsome one said it was arsenic, because then I should not be the one who\nwas pretending to commit a crime.\" So subtle a distinction would not,\nI think, have occurred to the subject in the waking condition.\nIn most of the cases referred to, the patients refused to carry out\nsuggestions in hypnosis which they would have rejected in the waking\nstate. Sometimes, however, they refused in hypnosis things they would\nreadily have done, or submitted to, when awake. For example, Dr.\nAllden, when Resident Physician at the Brompton Hospital, hypnotised\na girl suffering from chronic pulmonary disease. She was naturally\ndocile and obedient and rapidly became a good somnambule. On one\noccasion, after hypnotising her, the nurse reminded him that it was his\nday for examining the patient's chest, but, to his astonishment, she\nrefused to allow it to be bared. She had previously been examined\ndozens of times by himself and others and had never made the slightest\nobjection. He insisted upon her submitting, but was unable to over\ncome her resistance. He asked her why she objected now, when she\n\fWhat is Hypnotism ? 235\nhad never done so previously. She replied, \" You never tried before\nto examine my chest when I was asleep.\" On awaking, she remembered\nnothing of what had occurred and he said nothing to her about it.\nAfterwards the nurse told her, whereupon she was greatly distressed\nand wondered how she could possibly have been so rude to the doctor.\nThese, and many similar facts, have forced me to abandon all belief\nin so-called automatism or helpless obedience ; still, I must refer to\nsome of the arguments in support of it, before attempting to analyse\nfurther the mental condition in hypnosis.\n(1) When subjects successfully resist suggestion, it is usual to\nexplain this by assuming that they have not been so deeply hypnotised\nas those in whom no resistance has manifested itself. I cannot admit\nthe correctness of this in my cases. During the last seven years, I\nhave had frequent opportunities of examining hypnotic subjects, at\nhome and abroad, and have nowhere observed more profound somnam-\nbules than amongst my own patients, rarely, in fact, seeing cases to\nequal them. All to whom I have referred not only exhibited the\nphenomena of profoundest somnambulism, but nearly all had been\nsubjects of painless operations in the hypnotic state.\n(2) The personality of the operator, and his method of training his\nsubjects, is supposed to play an important part in the acceptance or\nrejection of suggestions. Granting that this be true, it does not\nexplain the resistance which I encountered. I commenced by believing\nthat the subjects were entirely at my mercy and did my best to develop\ntheir supposed obedience.\n(3) The existence of one class of phenomena is considered as\nnecessarily implying the existence of another and totally differing class.\nDurand le Gros asks :\u2014\"Is it possible that suggestion should have the\npower of producing extraordinary physical changes and yet be without\nthis particular effect upon the moral state?\" The facts I have already\ncited answer this question in the affirmative. Putting these aside, the\nassumption that the physical phenomena necessarily imply certain\nmoral ones is unreasonable. What inevitable connection exists, for\nexample, between an alteration in the pulse rate and the murder of\none's mother 1 Should I not be equally justified logically in assuming\nthat the subject in the normal state who, in response to suggestion,\nwould play the violin or paint a picture would be equally willing to rob\na church 1\n(4) Evidence in favour of obedience afforded by cases in which the\nsubjects are alleged to have accepted criminal and analogous sugges\ntions. These are important. The fact that the phenomenon of helpless\nobedience was invariably absent in my patients does not justify me in\nconcluding that it did not sometimes occur in those of others. These\ncases of so-called automatism fall into two classes : (a) where an\n\f236 Br. J. Milne Bramwell.\nimaginary crime has been suggested ; (b) where a real act has been\nperformed, which it is assumed the patient would not have submitted\nto in the normal state.\n(a) First, as regards imaginary crime ; here, as Professor Delboeuf\nhas pointed out, it is supposed that the patient is passing through\na mental state similar to that of the operator. Assumption without\nexperimental proof is a frail and unsatisfactory basis on which to\nerect a theory. Let us first examine the facts. A somnambule\nputs a piece of sugar into her mother's teacup, while her medical\nman makes various absurd and untruthful assertions as to its\ncomposition. Bernheim and Li\u00e9beault assert that the subject accepted\nthese absurd statements as true because, being hypnotised, she was\nunable to distinguish between truth and falsehood, while Delboeuf claims\nthat she had sufficient sense left to know exactly what she was doing.\nTo neither does it seem to have occurred to ask the subject during\nhypnosis what she thought about the matter herself. If they had\ndone so, she would promptly have solved the difficulty and told them\nthat while they were gravely discussing probabilities, she was quietly\nlaughing in her sleeve at the grotesque absurdity of the whole per\nformance. It may be noticed in passing that, while Bernheim considers\nthe Salpetriere subjects so abnormally acute that they can catch the\nslightest indication of the thoughts of the operator and so destroy the\nsupposed value of the phenomena alleged to be induced by metals,\nmagnets, drugs in sealed tubes, &c., he, on the other hand, supposes\nthe Nancy subjects to be so abnormally devoid of all intelligence as\nto be unable to understand when a palpable farce is played before them.\n(6) Where a real act has been performed, which it is assumed the\npatient would not have submitted to in the normal state. Of this\nBernheim cites an example. He states that he uncovered a young\nwoman, presumably a hospital patient, in the presence of his assistants\nand that she appeared perfectly calm and indifferent. Bernheim also\nquotes a case in which he entirely failed in persuading another young\nwoman, also a good somnambule, to allow him to uncover her, or to\ncommit an imaginary crime, despite the fact that he varied the\nsuggestion in every conceivable way. Let us take the case of supposed\nhelpless obedience. The mere fact that a woman permitted herself to\nbe uncovered does not necessarily imply that she was incapable of\nresisting. Before this can be used as an argument in favour of the\nhelpless obedience of the hypnotised subject, one is justified in demand\ning that it should be clearly proved that, under similar circumstances,\nthe patient would have objected to being uncovered in the waking\ncondition. Medical men are frequently obliged to uncover their female\npatients for examination and rarely encounter resistance. The\nfirst time that I visited Professor Bernheim's wards I was struck by\n\fWhat is Hypnotism ? 237\nthe fact that, in order to show some hysterical muscular movements in\nthe abdomen of a non-hypnotised subject, he threw off the bedclothes,\ndrew the patient's nightgown up to her neck and left her in that\ncondition while we examined other cases. Though such treatment is\nopposed to the practice of English hospitals, I do not propose to\ncriticise it. I only desire to draw attention to the fact that a patient\nwas stripped in the waking state\u2014from my point of view unnecessarily\nso\u2014and that she and every one else apparently regarded this as devoid\nof importance. The hypnotised subject did not object to be stripped.\nWhy should she? She must have been accustomed to see other patients\nexamined, and there is no special reason given why she should have\nobjected to the ordinary routine. Cases such as these appear to me\nabsolutely valueless, while the reasons for the patient's supposed\nobedience remain so easily accounted for in other ways. To render\nsuch a case worthy of serious consideration it would be absolutely\nnecessary to eliminate many important factors such as :\u20141. The fact\nthat the subject was ill. 2. That she was in a hospital where patients\nwere stripped as part of the ordinary routine. 3. That the examination\nwas made by a medical man.\nStrangely enough, the most marked case of resistance to suggestion\nthat I have observed was shown by Li\u00e9beault's celebrated somnam-\nbule, Camille. To this I have already referred, but I wish to emphasise\nthe fact that the classic hypnotic automaton, the one who was supposed\nto carry out a suggestion with the fatality of a falling stone, refused\none, not on moral grounds, but apparently from pure caprice.\nThe difference between the hypnotised and the normal subject, as\nit appears to me from a long series of observed facts, is not so much in\nconduct as in increased mental and physical powers. Any changes\nin the moral sense, I have noticed, have invariably been for the\nbetter, the hypnotised subject evincing superior refinement. As\nregards obedience to suggestion, there is apparently little to choose\nbetween the two. A hypnotised subject, who has acquired the power\nof manifesting various physical and mental phenomena, will do so in\nresponse to suggestion, for much the same reasons as one in the normal\ncondition. In the normal state we are usually pleased to show off our\nvarious gifts and attainments, more especially if we think they are\nsuperior to those of others, and in this respect the hypnotised subject\ndoes not differ from the normal. Both will refuse what is disagreeable ;\nin both this refusal may be modified or overcome by appeals to the\nreason, or to the usual motives which influence conduct. When the act\ndemanded is contrary to the moral sense, it is usually refused by the\nnormal subject, and invariably by the hypnotised one. I have never\nobserved any decrease of intelligence in hypnosis. In the alert state it\nis often conspicuously increased, while in the lethargic it is only\n\f238 Dr. J. Milne Bramwell.\napparently, not really, suspended. Forel's warders, who could sleep\nby the bedside of suicidal maniacs and wake immediately at a given\nsignal, or who could inhibit their own hearing of the purposeless noises\nof the insane and acutely hear everything which demanded their\nattention, did not in so doing show any real loss of intelligence. The\npower of concentration in the normal state, with its accompanying\ninhibition of undesirable impressions, is a well-known and somewhat\nanalogous condition, but one which is not usually regarded as indicative\nof mental degeneration.\nWhen one turns to the later works of Braid and sees how clearly\nhe experimentally proved that the hypnotised subject not only had the\npower of choosing between suggestions, but invariably refused those\nrepugnant to his moral nature, one cannot help feeling surprised at the\nrevival of theories, in reference to so-called automatism or obedience,\nidentical with the views of the mesmerists. More especially so when\none considers that Bernheim, who holds these views, also boldly asserts\nthat there is nothing in hypnotism but the name, that it does not\ncreate a new condition and that hypnotic acts are only exaggerated\nnormal ones. According to Bernheim, however, the moral state in\nhypnosis differs widely from the normal, and this is in obvious\ncontradiction to his own conception of hypnotism. One can under\nstand, for example, how a prolonged muscular rigidity may be a\nhypnotic exaggeration of a somewhat shorter normal one, but it\nis difficult to comprehend how the murder of one's mother when\nhypnotised can be an exaggeration of the refusal to hurt a fly\nwhen awake. Bernheim's view of the moral state does not follow\nlogically from the supposed resemblance between the hypnotic and\nnormal condition, but apparently has its origin in an erroneous estimate\nof the nature and power of suggestion. On the one hand, he tells us\nthat the hypnotic and normal conditions are practically identical, their\nonly distinction being a slight difference in suggestibility. On the other\nhand, we are informed that a virtuous individual will commit crime in\nresponse to hypnotic suggestion. If this were correct, we should be\njustified in describing the origin of hypnotic crimes thus :\u2014\n(a) A virtuous girl in the normal state has a natural tendency to\naccept the suggestion that she should murder her mother.\n(6) In hypnosis suggestibility is slightly increased and so, when it is\nsuggested to her to murder her mother, she does so.\nSuggested Crimes\u2014Summary.\n1. I have never seen a suggestion accepted in hypnosis which would\nhave been refused in the normal state.\n2. I have observed that suggestions could be resisted as easily in\nthe lethargic as in the alert stage.\n\fWhat is Hypnotism ? 239\n3. I have frequently noticed increased refinement in hypnosis ;\nsubjects have refused suggestions which they would have accepted in\nthe normal condition.\n4. I saw Camille refuse a suggestion from mere caprice.\n5. Examination of the mental condition in hypnosis revealed the\nfact that it was unimpaired.\n6. The arguments of Bernheim cannot be considered conclusive, as\nthey are founded solely on two classes of facts, (as) Where a simple\nand harmless act has been assumed to be thought criminal by the\nsubject, because the operator has stated it to be so. (5) Where the\nsubject has permitted something in hypnosis, which he would probably\nhave submitted to in the normal state.\nThe Influence of the Operator in inducing the so-called Automatism.\nIn the estimation of the part played by the operator, Braid differs\nfrom certain members of the Nancy School. According to the former,\nthe operator merely acts as an engineer who directs the forces in the\nsubject's own body, but the phenomena of hypnosis can also be evoked\nby ideas previously existing in the subject's mind. The latter regard\nthe operator's role as a much more important one ; not only are his\nsuggestions a mighty force in themselves, but their power is increased\nby constant undermining of the volition.\nMoll says, the suggested idea cannot be supplanted by a voluntary\none, because, owing to alterations in the attention which result from\nthe methods of the operator, the subject is unable to control the ideas\nconveyed to him, or to put forward his own. External ideas dominate\nhis consciousness. He thus explains negative hallucinations :\u2014the\nconviction of the non-existence of an object arises from the subject's\nweakened will and dependence on the operator. The fact that many\nmotor suggestions have already been made, which the subject has been\nunable to resist, renders further suggestions easy.\nForel's explanation is somewhat similar. For the successful mani\nfestation of hypnotic phenomena, he considers it essential that the\nsubject should be under the dominion of the operator and have lost his\nown power of concentration and attention. He regards the condition\nas a battle between operator and subject, in which the former, after\ncapturing outpost after outpost, at last reigns supreme in the central\ncitadel itself. \" The mind of a man, A, imposes itself,\" he says, \" upon\nthe mind of another man, B, takes possession of it by entering through\nsome crevice in its armour, and finishes by reigning there more or less\nas master and by employing the brain of B as its docile instrument.\"\nAccording to Bernheim, the natural tendency that exists in every\none to accept suggestions is gradually and skilfully developed by the\noperator.\nR\n\f240 Dr. J. Milne Bramwell.\nIn opposition to the views of Bernheim, &c, I would draw your\nattention to two classes of cases.\n(1) Where the operator has deliberately tried to minimise his own\nimportance in reference to the induction of hypnotic phenomena.\nAlthough I soon ceased to believe that the subject's volition was\ndominated by that of the operator, I still found, as the result of\nsensational writings on the question, that a considerable number of my\npatients objected to being hypnotised, on the ground that it would\ninterfere with their volition. To obviate this difficulty, I changed my\nmethod of inducing and managing the hypnotic state. I commenced\nby informing every new patient that I did not believe it possible for\nthe operator to dominate the volition of the subject, and that, even if\nsuch a thing were possible, it could certainly be prevented by sugges\ntion. I explained to my patients that nothing would be suggested\nwithout their consent having been previously obtained in the normal\nstate. Under these circumstances, if the suggestions were successful,\nthis would not imply any interference with volition, seeing that their\nconsent had already been obtained. I pointed out that the fulfilment\nof a hypnotic suggestion frequently demonstrated an increased, not\ndiminished, power of volition. For example, a patient who desired to\nresist a morbid impulse, but was unable to do so by the exercise of his\nnormal volition, might gain this power by hypnotic suggestion. Thus,\nthe suggestion did not suspend the volition of the subject, but removed\nthe obstacle which prevented the wish being carried into action.\nFurther, as resistance was manifested despite suggested obedience, it\nwas reasonable to expect that this might be enormously increased by\ntraining. I suggested, therefore, to all patients during hypnosis that\nthey should invariably possess this power of resistance, and also that\nneither I nor any one else should ever be able to reinduce hypnosis\nwithout their express consent. This change of method did not affect\nthe results. Notwithstanding the fact that the patients were con\nvinced, and justly so, that they possessed complete control of the whole\ncondition, hypnosis was evoked as easily as formerly, and as wide a\nrange of phenomena was induced.\n(2) Where an attempt has been made to teach the subject to evoke\nhypnosis and its phenomena without the intervention of the operator.\nSome six years ago I commenced to instruct patients to hypnotise\nthemselves. This was done by suggesting in hypnosis that they should\nbe able to reinduce the state at a given signal, as for example, by\ncounting \"One, two, three.\" These subjects could afterwards evoke the\ncondition at will. I also found that the use of suggestion during\nhypnosis was not necessary for the induction of its phenomena. On the\ncontrary, the suggestions could be made equally well beforehand in the\nwaking state. The subject was able to suggest to himself when\n\fWhat is Hypnotism ? 241\nhypnosis should appear and terminate, and also the phenomena which\nhe wished to obtain during and after it. This training was at first a\nlimited one ; the patients, for example, were instructed how to get\nsleep at night, or relief from pain. They did not, however, always\nconfine themselves to my suggestions, but originated others, and\nwidely varying ones, regarding their health, comfort, or work. Some,\ntrained in this way six years ago, still retain the power of hypnotising\nthemselves.\nIn such cases it would be difficult, I think, to explain hypnotic\nphenomena as the result of arrested or weakened volition, and of outside\ninterference by the operator. It might be objected, perhaps, that the\ninfluence of the operator had not been entirely eliminated, on the\nground that he had been associated with the induction of the primary\nhypnosis. The conditions, however, which are more or less frequently\nassociated with the origin of a particular state are by no means always\nessential for its after-manifestation. For instance, the art of swimming\nis usually taught either by means of a life-belt, or by attaching the\npupil to a cord which his teacher holds and guides by means of a rod.\nThese artificial aids, however, are not essential to the art of swimming ;\nthey are only useful in its acquirement. It would be illogical to\nascribe a champion's power of winning a race to the presence of a life\nbelt, which he discarded years before. In the same way, it would be\nunjustifiable to attribute a subject's power of influencing forces within\nhis own body by suggestions arising in his own mind, to the influence of\nthe operator who had formerly instructed him how to evoke and direct\nthis power.\nMonoideism.\nAlthough Braid and Bernheim differ on many points, they are in\ncomplete agreement as to the main factor in the problem. According\nto both, the essential condition is one of monoideism. The mind of the\nsubject is concentrated on a single idea. Only one function is active\nat any one time ; and intensely so, because all the attention is given to\nit. Other functions are inactive, other sensations unperceived, because\nthe subject has no attention left to give to them. Bernheim, as we\nhave seen, stated that, while the attention might be directed from one\npoint to another, concentration remained. This was regarded as\nessential and characteristic ; the existence and explanation of hypnotic\nphenomena depended on it. Impressions, which under ordinary\ncircumstances would reach consciousness, now ceased to do so, not\nonly because they did not happen to be attended to, but also because\nthe subject had nothing left wherewith to attend to them. Thus, this\nis not only a \" concentration of attention \" theory, but a \" concentration\nand limited quantity of attention \" theory.\nE 2\n\f242 Dr. J. Milne Bramwell.\nIn reference to this, Gurney says, \" the energy of attention is\nnot a fixed quantity, bound to be always in operation in one direction\nor another ; nor does the human mind, any more truly than Nature,\nabhor a vacuum. . . . What do we gain, then, by employing a\ngeneral term to describe such special effects 1 When once the chande\nlier metaphor is abandoned\u2014when once it is recognised that in a\nmultitude of cases the quantity of attention turned on in one direction\nis in no way connected with the withdrawal from any other\u2014the idea\nof a common psychic factor seems out of place and misleading.\"\n(v. Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. II., pp. 276 and 277.)\nThis theoretical objection is in accordance with observed facts.\nDoubtless certain hypnotic states exist in which all the attention, so\nfar as it is called into action, is concentrated upon one idea. In order\nto prove, however, that directing the attention upon a fresh point\nnecessarily withdraws it entirely from another, it must be shown that\nthe phenomenon which resulted from the first concentration inevitably\nceased when the second one arose. A cutaneous analgesia of the arm\nmight, with some show of reason, be said to result from attention\ndirected to the muscles during suggested catalepsy, on the ground that\nno attention was left wherewith to attend to painful sensations. But,\nwhile the catalepsy still exists, how\u2014on this theory\u2014can one explain,\nfor example, a cutaneous tactile hyperesthesia of the same limb, by\nmeans of which the subject can distinguish the points of the compass at\nhalf the normal distance? If the subject is unconscious of painful\nsensations because his attention is entirely concentrated on his\nmuscular condition, this same lack of attention to the skin ought not\nonly to have prevented abnormal distinctness of tactile impressions, but\nalso to have inhibited the usual ones. The experiment can be still\nfurther complicated, for, while still permitting the catalepsy to persist,\nthe cutaneous tactile hyperesthesia can be associated by suggestion with\na cutaneous analgesia over the same area. Now the subject's whole\nattention cannot be directed to maintaining a condition of muscular\nrigidity, if he has still enough of it left to suffice, not only for the\nincreased perception of certain tactile sensations, but also for the\nselection and inhibition of other painful ones. Further, the opposite of\nthese phenomena can be simultaneously evoked on the other side of the\nbody : the patient's muscles be paralysed by suggestion, his tactile\nsensibility abolished, and his sensibility to pain increased. The atten\ntion is now directed to six different points, and could with equal ease\nbe simultaneously directed to many others. A psychic blindness, for\nexample, could be suggested on one side ; a psychic deafness on the\nother ; hyperesthesia of the sense of smell and taste on one side, and\ndiminished or abolished sensibility on the other, etc., etc. But this is\nnot all, for while the attention is presumably turned in all these\n\fWhat is Hypnotism ? 243\ndifferent directions, the subject may be engaged in the attempted\nsolution of some intellectual problem. A still further complication is\npossible. Let us suppose that a fortnight before, in a previous hypnosis,\na suggestion to record the time at the expiration of 20,213 minutes had\nbeen made ; this will be carried out, despite the existence of the various\nmuscular and sensorial conditions already referred to, and the fact that\nat the moment of its fulfilment, the patient is engaged in some other\nmental effort.\nThis picture of the hypnotic state is neither fanciful, nor dependent\nsolely on my own personal observation. The fact that numerous and\nvaried hypnotic phenomena can be simultaneously evoked in the same\nsubject has been repeatedly observed and recorded by others, and,\nstrange to say, even by those who attempt to explain hypnosis by the\nconcentration of the attention upon a single point. It is solely the\nimportance of these facts with regard to this particular theory, which\nhas hitherto been so largely overlooked.\nGranting that hypnotic phenomena are the result of changes in the\nattention, one is forced to conclude that these are the exact reverse of\nthose stated by Bernheim as explanatory of the hypnotic state. The\nsimultaneous presence of many phenomena clearly show that hypnosis\ncannot be explained by the concentration of the attention on any one\ngiven point. Again, the fact that the multiple phenomena are some\ntimes similar in character to the isolated ones, indicates that the\nexplanation of hypnotic phenomena by means of the amount of\nattention concentrated is also fallacious. If all the attention is\nrequisite for the production of one phenomenon, and, while it still lasts,\nmany other hypnotic phenomena are simultaneously induced, whence\ndo the secondary ones derive that excessive amount of attention which\nis said to be necessary for the induction of the primary one 1 The\nhypnotic condition differs then from the normal, not because only one\nphenomenon can be manifested in it at once, but because it may present\nsimultaneously many and more varied phenomena than can be evoked\nin the normal state at any one time. In one word, hypnosis is a state\nof poly-ideism, not of mono-ideism.\nThe Subliminal Consciousness Theory.\nWithin recent times another theory has arisen. This, instead of\nattempting to explain hypnotism by the arrested action of some of the\nbrain centres which subserve normal life, would do so through the\narousing of certain powers over which we normally have little or no\ncontrol. This theory appears under various names\u2014\" Double Con\nsciousness,\" \"Das Doppel Ich,\" etc.\u2014and the principle on which it\ndepends is largely admitted by science. William James, for example,\n\f244 Br. J. Milne Bramwell.\nsays, \" In certain persons, at least, the total possible consciousness may\nbe split into parts which co-exist, but mutually ignore each other.\"\nThe clearest statement of this view is given by Mr. Myers ; he\nsuggests that the stream of consciousness in which we habitually live\nis not our only one. Possibly our habitual consciousness may be a mere\nselection from a multitude of thoughts and sensations,\u2014some at least\nequally conscious with those we empirically know. No primacy is\ngranted by this theory to the ordinary waking self, except that among\npotential selves it appears the fittest to meet the needs of common life.\nAs a rule the waking life is remembered in hypnosis, and the hypnotic\nlife is forgotten in the waking state,\u2014this destroys any claim of the\nprimary memory to be the sole memory. The self below the threshold\nof ordinary consciousness, Mr. Myers terms the \" subliminal conscious\nness,\" and the empirical self of common experience the \"supraliminal.\"\nHe holds that to the subliminal consciousness and memory a far wider\nrange both of physiological and of psychical activity is open than to\nthe supraliminal. The latter is inevitably limited by the need of\nconcentration upon recollections useful in the struggle for existence,\nwhile the former includes much that is too rudimentary to be retained\nin the supraliminal memory of an organism so advanced as man. The\nrecollection of processes now performed automatically and needing no\nsupervision passes out of the supraliminal memory, but may be retained\nin the subliminal. The subliminal or hypnotic self can exercise over\nthe nervous, vasomotor, and circulatory systems a degree of control\nunparalleled in waking life.\nHe suggests that the spectrum of consciousness, as he calls it,\nis indefinitely extended at both ends in the subliminal self. Below its\nsupraliminal physiological limit lie a vast number of complex processes\nbelonging to the body's nutrition and well-being. These our remote\nancestors may possibly have been able to modify at will, but to us\nthey seem entirely withdrawn from our sphere of volition. If we wish\nto alter them we must do so by drugs and medicaments, whether the\nbody to be treated is our own or another's.\nAt the superior or psychical end the subliminal memory includes an\nunknown category of impressions which the supraliminal consciousness\nis incapable of receiving in any direct fashion, and which it must\ncognise, if at all, in the shape of messages from the subliminal\nconsciousness.\nMr. Myers arranges hypnotic phenomena into three divisions.\n1. The great dissociative triumph of hypnotism, namely, the\ninhibition of pain under conditions of nerve and tissue with which it\nis usually inevitably connected.\nHere, psychologically, the whole interest lies in the question\nwhether pain is suppressed together with sensations of every kind, or\n\fWhat is Hypnotism? 245\nwhether other sensations persist, pain alone being inhibited. Our\nancestors, Mr. Myers suggests, had already attained to a rough practical\nknowledge of this distinction. They knew that if you stunned a man\nby a blow he would not feel the pain for some time. Also, that if you\nran pins into particular parts on a witch's body, she, although perfectly\nawake, and conscious of other sensations, would feel no smart.\nThe second of these discoveries was the more important. By\nstunning your enemy, you only proved that vital functions could\ncontinue unimpaired, notwithstanding that the brain's action was so\nfar disturbed that all consciousness was temporarily abolished. By\npricking the witch in her \" marks \"\u2014now called hysterical analgesic\nzones or patches\u2014you proved that pain was a dissociable accident of\norganic injury, that other sensations might persist and only that of pain\nbe in some way inhibited. The insensitiveness to pain which runs wild\nin hysteria is now being directed into useful channels by \" hypnotic\nsuggestion.\" Some intelligence is involved in a suppression thus\nachieved ; for this is obtained, not as with narcotics by a general loss of\nconsciousness, but by the selection and inhibition, from among all the\npercipient's possible sensations, of disagreeable ones alone. This is not\na mere anaesthetisation of some particular group of nerve-endings,\u2014\nsuch as cocaine produces : it involves the removal also of a number of\nconcomitant feelings of nausea, exhaustion, anxiety, not always directly\ndependent on the principal pain, but needing, as it were, to be first\nsubjectively distinguished as disagreeable before they are picked out\nfor inhibition. This freedom from pain is obtained without either\ndeadening or dislocating the general nervous system; with no approach\neither to coma or to hysteria. The so-called hypnotic trance is not\nalways necessary : sometimes the pain can be prevented by post\nhypnotic suggestion destined to fulfil itself after the awakening. And\nif there be trance, this is often no mere lethargy, but a state fully as\nalert and vivid as ordinary waking life.\nMr. Myers argues from this that it is plain that hypnotic analgesia\nthus induced is by no means a mere ordinary narcotic\u2014 a fresh specimen\nof such methods as are already familiar for checking pain by arresting\nall conscious cerebration. It is a new departure ; the first successful\nattempt at dissociating forms of sensation which throughout the known\nhistory of the human organism have almost invariably been found to\nexist together.\n2. The associative or synthetic triumphs of hypnotism, namely,\nthe production and control of organic processes which no effort of the\nordinary man can set going, or in any way influence.\nHypnotic analgesia, Mr. Myers says, may be classed with equal\njustice as a dissociative, or as an associative act. The sensations are\nsevered from the main supraliminal current and thus far the act is\n\f246 Dr. J. Milne Bramwell.\ndissociative. The group itself, however, has to be formed and the more\ncomplex it is, the more this involves some associative act. Inhibition\nof all the pain consequent on an operation is in reality a complicated\nassociative process. It involves (1) the singling out and fitting together\nof a great number of sensations which have only the subjective bond of\nbeing disagreeable, and (2) the inhibition of all of them, which thus\nleaves the supraliminal consciousness in perfect ease.\nIn further illustration of the associative powers of hypnotism, Mr.\nMyers refers to alterations in the pulse, the secretions, excretions, etc.\nHe also cites Delboeuf's case of two symmetrical burns on the same\nsubject, one running the ordinary course of inflammation, the other in\nwhich morbid action was arrested by suggestion.\n3. The intellectual or moral achievements of hypnotism.\nThese, like the others, are based upon physiological changes, but\npresent problems still more profound. The removal of the craving for\nalcohol and morphia, the cure of kleptomania, bad temper, excessive\nindolence, etc., are cited as illustrating the moral and psychological\nchanges which suggestion can effect.\nVolition, etc.\nAccording to Mr. Myers, the hypnotic subject is not a maimed or\nstunted normal individual, but one who, while he has gained increased\npower over his own organism, has not at the same time lost his volition,\nor the mental and moral qualities which formerly distinguished him.\nHe admits that there is some difficulty in explaining hypnotic obedience,\nbut holds that this will be refused when the act suggested is contrary\nto the subject's moral nature. He believes that a complete comprehen\nsion of the suggested act exists in the subliminal strata; and that, when\ngrave need arises, the subliminal self will generally avoid compliance\u2014\nnot by awakening the organism into ordinary life, but by plunging it\ninto a hysterical access, or into a trance so deep that the unwelcome\norder loses its agitating power. The moral tone of the somnambule is,\nin Mr. Myers' opinion, the precise opposite of the drunken condition.\nAlcohol, apparently by paralysing first the higher inhibitory centres,\nmakes men boastful, impure, and quarrelsome. Hypnotisation,\napparently by a tendency to paralyse lower appetitive centres, produces\nthe contrary effect. The increased refinement and cheerfulness of the\ndeveloped somnambule is constantly noticed.\nThe Possible Source or Origin of Hypnotic Control over Intimate\nOrganic Processes.\nMr. Myers asks whether we can find anything in our ancestry\nwhich suggests to us these internal powers of modifying circulation,\n\fWhat is Hypnotism? 247\nquickening cell-proliferation, and altering trophic processes in unknown\nways. He admits that the analogies to which we can appeal are\nvague and remote, yet he says we can point to the general fact\nthat in man and the higher animals an increase in the power of\nmodifying the action of the organism as a whole, has evidently\nbeen purchased by a decrease in the power of modifying its internal\nparts or constituent elements. The self-shaping powers of the amoeba,\nthe self-regenerating powers of the worm or crab, die gradually\naway into the comparative fixity of the organism of the higher\nmammalia.\nIt is possible, he thinks, that this fixity is more apparent than\nreal :\u2014\" We may regard the human organism as an aggregation of\nprimitive, unicellular organisms, which have divided their functions,\nand complicated their union, in response to the demands of the\nenvironment, and along such lines of evolution as were possible to the\noriginal germ. It is possible, too, that all these processes\u2014beginning\nwith the amoeboid movements of the primitive cell\u2014were accompanied\nby a capacity of retaining the impress of previous excitations, a\nrudimentary memory which at first constituted all the consciousness\nwhich our lowly ancestors possessed. And further\u2014may we not\nsuggest?\u2014as evolution went on and more complex operations were\ndeveloped, while the primitive processes of cell - change became\nstereotyped by long heredity, the memory which represented these\nearlier changes sank to a low psychical depth ;\u2014became subliminal, and\ncould no longer be summoned by voluntary effort into the supraliminal\nsequence of conscious states. How do we know that any psychical\nacquisition is ever wholly lost ? Or even that a memory is the weaker\nbecause it has sunk out of voluntary control 1 It may be possible, by\nappropriate artifices, to recall primeval memories, and to set in motion\nany physiological process which could at any moment of our ancestral\nhistory have been purposively, however blindly, performed.\" (v. Pro\nceedings S.P.R., Vol. VII., pp. 345-6.)\nMr. Myers refers to the fact that Professor Delboeuf, although in no\nway committed to the conception of a subliminal self, has been led to a\nsomewhat similar hypothesis.\nDelboeuf, in reference particularly to his case of the two symmetrical\nburns, says that experiments like those lead us to suppose that the\naction of the moral on the physical may be almost, if not quite, equal\nto that of the physical on the moral. Thence it follows that the idea\nof physical mischief may produce mischief ; and, on the other hand,\nthat the idea of absence of mischief may bring about, or at least\nfavour, a cure. How, asks Delboeuf, are we to explain the mechanism\nof this inverse action of the moral and the physical 1 We are forced\nto admit that the influence of the will is more extended than we used\n\f248 Dr. J. Milne Bramwell.\nto suppose. It may be able to act, not only on the reflexes, but on\nthe vasomotor system, on the unstriped muscles, on the apparatus of\nsecretion, etc. If a contrary opinion has till now prevailed, this is\nbecause observation has been exclusively directed to the normal\nexercise of the will. In ordinary life, in fact, our attention is mainly\nconcentrated on the external world, the principal source of our\npleasures and our pains, and our will is devoted to perfecting our\nmeans of attack and defence. The care of the vegetative life has\nbeen handed over by the will to nervous mechanisms which have learnt\nto regulate themselves, and which in general fulfil their task to per\nfection. Thus, the rapid changes of external phenomena mask the\nregularity of internal phenomena, which accomplish themselves habitu\nally without our knowledge. But in the hypnotic state the mind is in\npart drawn aside from the life of relation, while at the same time it\npreserves its activity and power. It can then, under the impulsion of\nthe hypnotiser, employ those powers to regulate movements which\nhave become irregular, or to repair injuries to the organism. In a\nword, hypnotism does not depress, but exalts the will, by permitting\nit to concentrate itself entirely upon the point where disorder is\nthreatened.\nCan all the effects of hypnotic suggestion be explained, Mr. Myers\nasks, by even the most complete revival of ancestral memories 1 Do\nnot the moral or psychological achievements represent a point beyond\nthat to which such analogies will carry us 1 \" These changes must,\" he\nsays, \" or course rest on a physiological basis ; but that basis implies a\nwell-developed, a human brain. The knowledge of cortical centres, which\nmust somewhere exist to make such changes possible, can scarcely have\nbeen inherited from pre-human ancestors. Nothing, perhaps, in the\nwhole inquiry is of deeper interest than the possibilities thus dawning\nupon us of disentangling from the cerebral labyrinth which represents\na man's tastes and character the special brain processes which stand\nfor some special temptation\u2014say, those which represent the reaction\nof his organism to alcohol. What is the hidden process that to one\npatient makes brandy as nauseating as it is to a cat\u2014that in another\npatient makes the morphia-craving as impossible as it is to a rabbit 1 \"\n(v. Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VII., p. 347.)\nHysteria, a Disease of the Subliminal Self.\nMr. Myers does not consider the subliminal self free from dis\nturbance and disease, any more than the supraliminal. He points out\nthat there is a marked analogy between the changes in the nervous\nvasomotor and circulatory systems which are to be found in the\nhypnotic state, and those which manifest themselves in hysteria. An\nimportant difference exists between them, however ; in the former they\n\fWhat is Hypnotism ? 249\nare under the control of the operator or the subject himself, in the\nlatter they are the result of irrational self-suggestion in regions beyond\nthe power of the waking will. Hysterical anaesthesia or analgesia\nimplies a power of modifying the sensibility to touch or pain which\nwe cannot imitate under ordinary conditions. He does not regard\nhypnotism as a morbid state, but simply as a manifestation of a group\nof perfectly normal, but habitually subjacent powers. Self-suggested\ntroubles are a disease of the hypnotic substratum ; and hysteria falls\nunder the category of hypnotism, not hypnotism under hysteria.\nAfter criticising adversely the theories of Mesmer, Heidenhain,\nCharcot, Bernheim, and others, Myers says :\u2014\" It is, therefore, as it\nseems to me, in a field almost clear of hypotheses that I suggest my\nown ;\u2014my view that a stream of consciousness flows on within us, at a\nlevel beneath the threshold of ordinary waking life, and that this\nconsciousness embraces unknown powers of which these hypnotic\nphenomena give us the first sample.\" (v. Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VII.,\np. 350.)\nThis theory presents many interesting points for consideration.\n\/.\u2014The Hypnotic Powers and the Conditions more immediately\nassociated with them.\nThe special point of interest in the cases cited as illustrating the\npowers of the hypnotic state is the supposed mental condition of the\nsubject. The immediate origin of hypnotic phenomena depends,\naccording to Mr. Myers, upon a voluntary alteration in the arrange\nment of ideas. The introduction of the term voluntary, and the\nrecognition that all the subject's attention is not requisite for the\nproduction of a solitary hypnotic phenomenon, is one of the most\nimportant distinctions that exists between this theory and some of\nthose we have already considered.\nRegarding Bernheim's theory, I raised the following objections :\u2014\n1. The condition cannot be called one of monoideism, because many\nphenomena can be evoked at the same time.\n2. It cannot be explained by the concentration of the attention\nupon a single point, because, again, many phenomena can be evoked\nsimultaneously.\n3. It is not due to arrested or impaired volition, as we have\nshown (a) that the subject can resist the suggestions of the operator,\nand (b) in cases of self-hypnosis, voluntarily create the phenomena\nfor himself.\n4. It could not be explained by suggestion, as this was merely\nthe artifice used to excite the phenomena.\n\f250 Dr. J. Milne Bramwell.\nDespite these objections, one must admit that certain phenomena\ndescribed by Mr. Myers, and others cited as illustrating the theory of\nmonoideism, possess one important feature in common, namely, a\nchange in the arrangement of ideas. If, for example, a hypnotised\nsubject, supposed to be under the influence of his operator, sees a\nhallucinatory cat, and a self-hypnotised subject successfully suggests\none to himself, the phenomenon is practically identical in both\ninstances. The only difference is in the explanation of its origin.\nAccording to Bennett, the hypnotised subject sees a hallucinatory cat\nbecause the genesis of his ideas is not interfered with, but only their\nvoluntary synthesis. Thus, the operator is able to suggest the\nremembrance of a cat ; but the subject, owing to the involuntary\narrest of certain mental powers, fails to understand that it is only a\nremembrance, and believes in its reality. In Mr. Myers' opinion\nthe subject, instead of having lost the power of voluntary synthesis of\nideas, has acquired an increased power of voluntary association and\ndissociation of ideas. The remembrance of the image of a cat has\nreceived hallucinatory vividness, not because he was unable to check\nit from lack of voluntary synthesis of ideas, but because he has elected\nto allow it to become vivid by voluntarily inhibiting the appearance\nof all the ideas which would have interfered with its clearness, while,\nat the same time, he has associated with it ideas connected with the\nremembrance of formerly seen cats.\nBernheim, as we have already seen, attempted to explain the\nphenomena of hypnosis by the involuntary concentration of the\nattention on one point. According to Mr. Myers, the mental changes\nwhich take place are voluntary ones, and thus, if the phenomena are\ndue to the subject's attention, he must have acquired the power not\nonly of turning it upon one point, but upon several points simultane\nously. The inhibition of sensory impressions in hypnosis presents a\ncertain analogy to what is found in the normal state. The student at\nhis books who wishes to carry on his work without disturbance, may\ngradually train himself to be unconscious of external sounds. He\nteaches his attention to concentrate itself upon the problem before\nhim, and to disregard more and more the noises which might distract\nhim. So also, in looking into a microscope with one eye, he may train\nhimself to keep the other eye open, and at the same time to become\nunconscious of the objects within its field of vision. Here, both the\nhypnotised and non-hypnotised subject are producing voluntary\nchanges in their attention. Important points of difference, however,\nexist between the two.\n1. The student does not disregard auditory or visual impressions\nthe first time he tries to do so. On the contrary, prolonged training\nis often necessary in order to obtain this power ; and frequently he is\n\fWhat is Hypnotism ? 251\nunable to acquire it. In the deeply hypnotised subject, on the other\nhand, the power can be developed by a single suggestion and with\nalmost absolute certainty.\n2. In the normal subject the inhibition of the sensory impressions\nis associated with concentration of the attention upon something else.\nThe moment the student closes his books he becomes conscious, for\nexample, of the organ grinder under his window, whose presence he\nwas ignorant of a moment before. The instant the attention ceases to\nbe directed to the object under the microscope, the brain becomes con\nscious of the impressions received through the other eye. With the\nhypnotised subject the condition of the attention is extremely variable.\nYou may have absence of painful sensations at the very moment that\nyou direct the subject's attention to the fact that you are piercing his\nflesh deeply with a needle. Again, you may have increased sensory\nperceptions of the points of a compass when you have engaged his\nattention in the attempted solution of a mental problem. The inhibi\ntion of sensory impressions by the normal subject might perhaps be\njustly regarded as an acquired automatic act, but it is an automatism\nwhich only acts properly when the attention is voluntarily con\ncentrated on something else. At first the attention must have been\nconsciously divided between the problem contained in the book and\nthe process of inhibiting the sensory impressions. In the hypnotised\nsubject the inhibitory act, seeing that it was performed without\nprevious training, cannot be regarded as completely analogous to the\nacquired automatic inhibitory act of the normal subject. It can also\nbe performed without conscious concentration of all the attention in\nanother direction. We must not conclude, however, that the hypnotic\nact is not associated with a concentration of some of the attention,\nmerely because (a) the subject is attending to something else at the\nsame time and (6) because he is not conscious of attending to the\nparticular act itself. It is possible that the hypnotic act may have\nbeen performed by means of a conscious concentration of attention\nwhich existed in some lower hypnotic substratum of the personality.\nII.\u2014Moral and Volitional Conditions.\nThe views of Mr. Myers practically agree with those I have already\nexpressed in discussing the question of so-called automatism. I have\nnot, however, seen subjects try to escape objectionable commands in\nthe manner which he describes ; though some instances of this kind\nhave been recorded by Professor Beaunis and others. In one of these\ncases the patient refused to awake, after a disagreeable post-hypnotic\nsuggestion had been given. Another, under similar circumstances,\nrather than fulfil the suggestion, passed from the alert to the deep\nstage of hypnosis.\n\f252 Dr. J. Milne Bramwell.\nIII.\u2014Hysteria.\nMr. Myers' theory that hysteria is a disease of the hypnotic sub\nstratum is an extremely ingenious one, and is the only reasonable ex\nplanation of the resemblance between certain hypnotic and hysterical\nphenomena with which I am acquainted. As we have seen, those who\nbelieved that hypnosis and hysteria were identical stated that the\nhysterical alone could be hypnotised. On the other hand, those with\nwider experience have successfully demonstrated that the hysterical\nare generally, if not invariably, the most difficult to influence. Of this\nfact Mr. Myers' theory possibly affords an explanation. May not the\ndifficulty of inducing hypnosis in the hysterical\u2014of making one's\nsuggestions find a resting-place in them\u2014be due to the fact that the\nhypnotic substratum of their personality is already occupied by\nirrational self-suggestions which the subject's waking will cannot\ncontrol 1\nIV.\u2014 What is the Evidence for the Existence of a Subliminal\nConsciousness ?\nMany cases of alternating consciousnesses have been observed in\nthe non-hypnotised subject. As a rule this has been associated with\nhysteria or other morbid conditions. Sometimes the primary waking\nstate has been morbid, the secondary one healthy. Of this class,\nFelida X., so ably described by Dr. Azam, is the familiar example.\nThe work and writings of Edmund Gurney, Dr. A. T. Myers, Mr.\nFrederic Myers, Pierre Janet, William James, and many others have\nrendered us familiar with the phenomenon of secondary or multiple\nconsciousness in hypnosis. It can be experimentally demonstrated not\nonly that the hypnotised subject possesses a secondary consciousness,\nwhich alternates with his primary one, but also that it is possible for\nthe two to coexist and to manifest different phenomena simultaneously.\nFor example, an individual may have his attention concentrated upon\nthe act of reading aloud from a book with which he was previously un\nacquainted; and, at the same instant, he may be writing automatically,\n\u2014as far as his primary consciousness is concerned,\u2014the result of a\nproblem which was suggested to him in hypnosis the moment before\nthat state was terminated. The primary waking consciousness retains\nno recollection of the hypnotic suggestion ; does not know that the\nsecondary consciousness, after the hypnotic state has been terminated,\nfirst solves the problem and then directs the motor acts which record\nit ; and is also unconscious of the motor acts themselves.\nIn Mr. Myers' opinion, the general alternations in memory which\noccur in connection with hypnosis, afford the strongest evidence in\nfavour of a subliminal or secondary consciousness. As a rule, he says,\n\fWhat is Hypnotism ? 253\nthe hypnotised subject remembers waking life, but when awake has\nusually forgotten the events of the hypnotic trance. This statement\ncannot be accepted unquestioned. According to Braid, amnesia\nregarding the events of hypnosis only showed itself in 10 per cent, of\nthose whom he hypnotised, while Schrenck-Notzing's \" International\nStatistics \" give 1 5 per cent. It is to be noted also that this amnesia\nrarely occurs the first time hypnosis is induced, but, on the contrary,\nfrequently shows itself only after the process has been repeated many\ntimes. Under such circumstances it is impossible to be certain that\nthe condition was not artificially created by training, in the same way\nas analgesia, hyperesthesia, and other phenomena of hypnosis. Un\ndoubtedly the operator frequently suggests amnesia ; but, even when it\nis carefully explained that the primary hypnosis is rarely or ever\nfollowed by it, I almost invariably find that the idea is so deeply\nrooted in the subject's mind that he suggests it to himself. Again,\nthis amnesia can be prevented by suggestion. This objection is,\nhowever, of little importance. Your next-door neighbour would still\ncontinue to possess his former characteristics, even if you broke down\nthe partition between your house and his, and afforded him free\nfacilities for passing from one to the other.\nWhile we must admit that this general amnesia only occurs in a\nsmall per centage of hypnotised subjects, forgetfulness in reference to\nmany of the details of hypnotic life is very common, and apparently\naffords evidence for the existence not only of one, but of several sub\nconscious states. The subject, who on awaking apparently remembers\nwhat has happened in hypnosis, does not really recollect everything\nthat has occurred. He may remember that the prick of a needle\ncaused no pain, but may be quite unable to recall the mental\nphenomena which\u2014on Mr. Myers' theory\u2014must have been involved in\nthe selection and inhibition of painful sensations. The memory of\nthis selective and inhibitory process is lost not only to the primary\nconsciousness, but apparently to the ordinary hypnotic one also ; for\nquestioning in hypnosis fails to revive it. Again, the patient who\nwrongly calculated in hypnosis when a complicated time-suggestion\nwould fall due, but successfully carried the suggestion out in the\nwaking state (although no recollection of the original suggestion, nor\nof the erroneous calculation and its subsequent correction, existed\nin the normal waking consciousness), was unable to recall in hypnosis\nthat she had corrected the original erroneous calculation. This\nforgetfulness, we see, is not only manifested in reference to acts which\nmight possibly be regarded as automatic ones inherited from some\nancestral type, but is also shown in regard to others of an entirely\ndifferent nature, and which could not possibly have arisen in this way.\nSome of these phenomena, then, cannot be regarded as hereditary\n\f254 Dr. J. Milne Bramwell.\nautomatic acts of the hypnotic state, nor as analogous to normal\nacquired automatic ones, seeing that they had not previously been\nfrequently performed in the hypnotic condition. The simultaneous\nappearance in hypnosis of a greater number of phenomena (regarding\nthem from their numerical side only) than can be manifested in\nwaking life, is possibly also to be explained by the existence of several\nsubconscious states. The normal attention apparently cannot attend\nto so many things at once as the hypnotic. Now, as we have seen,\ncertain of these hypnotic acts, seemingly performed unconsciously,\nreally demand intelligent attention : not only did they require it in\nthe past, but, as they are neither inherited nor acquired automatic\nacts, they obviously require it now.\nGranting that one or more subconscious states exist in the human\npersonality, and that hypnotic phenomena owe their origin to the fact\nthat we have by some means or another succeeded in tapping them,\ntwo questions still remain :\u2014\nThus, let it be supposed that I possess a friend called Brown, who\nis usually, physically and mentally, an ordinary individual ; from time\nto time, however, he manifests an extraordinary increase of physical\npower. Again, though still more rarely, he displays a range of\nmental powers of which he had formerly given no indication. I ask\nfor an explanation and am told that Brown, as I know him best, is\nindeed Brown, but that his increased physical powers are due to the\nfact that when he shows them he is Jones, and his increased mental\nones to the further fact that he is then Robinson. Granting that the\nphenomena afford evidence of the existence of three separate per\nsonalities, I cannot accept this explanation as a solution of the problem\nin its entirety. I want to know, first, how Jones and Robinson\nacquired their powers, and secondly, what has been done to or by\nBrown which has enabled these powers to be evoked.\n1. How did Jones and Robinson gain their Powers 1\nMr. Myers' explanation,\u2014or, at all events, part of it,\u2014is that\nthese powers are a revival of those formerly possessed by some lower\nancestral type. He frankly admits, however, that the analogies to\nwhich we can appeal are certainly vague and remote, and that to find\nthem we must leave the higher mammalia, and descend to the crab,\nworm or amoeba.\nIs it reasonable to suppose that the Hypnotic Powers, regarded as a\nWhole, existed in some lower Ancestral Type 1\nGranting that a limited analogy exists between lower animal types\nand hypnotised subjects as to their power of influencing certain\nphysical conditions, it would, I think, be impossible to establish an\n\fWhat is Hypnotism? 255\nanalogy between the mental and moral powers of the latter, and those\nof the savage or lower animal. For example, one of my patients, as\nwe have seen, suddenly developed arithmetical powers far exceeding\nthose she possessed in the normal state. She is not likely to have\nderived them from some savage ancestor who was unable to count\nbeyond five, or from some lower animal, presumably ignorant of\narithmetic. Again, the same patient spontaneously solved, in hypnosis, a\ndifficult problem in dressmaking. The power of correctly designing a\ngarment in accordance with the passing fashion of the present day can\nhardly have been derived from some woad-stained ancestor, or lower\nanimal form. Further, the increased modesty of the hypnotised subject,\nhis greater power of controlling or checking morbid passions or\ncravings, does not find its counterpart in the savage or ape.\nMr. Myers admits that the argument from analogy is weakest\nwhen we consider the mental and moral powers of hypnosis. But if\nit is the essential characteristic of the subliminal state that the\nspectrum of consciousness is extended at both ends, surely an ex\nplanation of both extensions is equally necessary. A theory in itself\nimperfect becomes still more so when every fact that is supposed to\nestablish the extension of one end of the spectrum renders the\nextension of the other end still more difficult of explanation.\nIf we admit that Hypnotic Powers are derived from some Lowly,\nNon-human type, is their Easy Recovery probable 1\nI have seen cases in which all the phenomena characteristic\nof deepest hypnosis could be readily evoked, absolutely without\ntraining, within a couple of minutes of the commencement of the\nprocess employed for the induction of the primary hypnosis. If any\nof these were derived from amoeba, worm or crab, the rapidity with\nwhich they were aroused was surely surprising.\nIs it likely that the Powers should have been Lost in Development ?\nThe powers of the hypnotic state are said to have dropped out of\nthe supraliminal consciousness in the process of evolution, as their\nassociation with it had become unnecessary in the struggle for\nexistence. It must be noticed, however, that many of them have not\nonly ceased to be employed automatically or unconsciously, but have\nalso sometimes apparently disappeared altogether ; and until hypnosis\nwas induced, no means existed by which the supraliminal consciousness\ncould evoke them. Now the powers which the hypnotic self possesses\nare so numerous, varied, and frequently so essential for the comfort or\nwell-being of the individual, that one with difficulty concludes that\ndevelopment is responsible for their loss. Take, for example, the power\nof inhibiting pain. Granting that some lower type possessed it, a\ns\n\f256 Dr. J. Milne Bramwell.\nfact difficult to prove, when and why has this important power been\ndropped? In this hyper-civilised age, we appear to have abandoned\nthe powers of the subliminal self just at the very moment when\nwe most require them. Complaints about street-noises and the\nmanners of children show that in many instances, at all events, the\nsupraliminal self is sadly embarrassed by the fact that it cannot\nperform that feat, so easy to the subliminal one, of shutting out\nundesired sensations of sound ; and in consequence, can neither work\nby day nor sleep by night.\nCan the process which has deprived the supraliminal self of so\nmuch that is advantageous be justly described as an evolution from a\nlower to a higher type ? Should it not rather be considered as a sort\nof Rake's Progress, where the hero of the story has gradually stripped\nhimself of all the treasured possessions of his forefathers, and has\nfinished by selling even the ancestral portraits from off his walls 1 '\n2. What is the Connection between Hypnotic Methods and the\nProduction of Hypnotic Phenomena 1\nTo this I think no reasonable answer has been given. Personally,\nI can see no logical connection between the acts of fixed gazing, or\nof concentration of attention, or suggested ideas of drowsy states, and\nthe wide and varied phenomena of hypnosis. Hypnotic phenomena do\nnot appear spontaneously, and some of the methods described must\nhave been employed in order to induce the primary hypnosis. But I\ncannot conceive the idea that the one explains the other.\nSummary.\nIf the theory of subliminal consciousness does not satisfactorily\nexplain all the problems of hypnotism, we are at all events indebted\nto it for a clearer conception, not only of the condition as a whole, but\nalso of many of its component parts.\nThe following points in the theory seem most worthy of notice :\u2014\n1. That the essential characteristic of the hypnotic state is the\nsubject's far-reaching power over his own organism.\n2. That volition is increased and the moral state improved.\n3. That the phenomena of hypnosis arise from, or at all events are\nintimately connected with, voluntary alterations in the association and\ndissociation of ideas.\n4. That subliminal or subconscious states are more clearly defined\nthan in previous theories.\nConsiderable analogy exists between Mr. Myers' theory and Braid's\nlater one. In reference to the two first points their views are\n\u25a0\n\fWhat is Hypnotism ? 257\nidentical. Little difference exists between them as to the third.\nBraid and Bennett both appreciated the important part played by\nthe arrangement of ideas in the production of hypnotic phenomena.\nWhile the latter held that this was involuntary, the former recognised\nthat the volition was unimpaired. The existence of alternating\nconsciousnesses was not only recognised by Braid, but was also\nregarded by him as explanatory of certain hypnotic phenomena. He\ndid not ascribe to it, however, the same importance as Mr. Myers\ndoes, nor did he try to find in it a possible solution of all hypnotic\nproblems.\nWhile Mr. Myers' theory may with justice be described as\nsuch a development of Braid's as might have been expected from the\nincreased knowledge due to further, accumulation of facts, some of the\nother theories already considered show a tendency to revert to\n\" mesmeric \" types. The views as to the methods by which hypnotic\nphenomena are evoked especially show this. The mesmerists attached\nmore importance to the means by which the phenomena were excited\nthan to the subject himself. The \" odyllic \" force could exercise its\npower against the will of the subject and without his knowledge.\nEvery one was not susceptible to this influence, those who were being\ntermed \"sensitives.\" The Charcot School hold that some inanimate\nobjects are capable of producing many phenomena practically identi\ncal with the \"mesmeric.\" Like the mesmerists, they believe that\nthe influence can be exerted without the subject's knowledge, and also\nthat every one is not susceptible to it. For the term \" sensitive \" they\nsubstitute that of \" hysterical.\" Bernheim's theory resembles that of\nthe mesmerists still more closely. He regards the operator, not the\nsubject, as the more important factor, and believes that a skilful\noperator can hypnotise at least 90 per cent, of mankind. He holds\nthat in many instances the operator can compel the obedience of the\nsubject and force him to perform criminal acts. On this point he\ndiffers from the Charcot School, and agrees with the mesmerists. The\npower by which he evokes and also explains the phenomena, called, as\nwe have seen, by the mesmerists \"odyllic force\" and by Charcot\n\"hysteria,\" he terms \"suggestion.\" Braid and Myers regard the\noperator as the mere starter of the phenomena. His existence, ac\ncording to Braid, is not even necessary. These observers differ from\nBernheim in reference to criminal suggestion and various other points\nalready noticed.\nIf Braid and Myers have done much towards giving us a clearer\nidea of the hypnotic state, they have also added to the difficulties of\nexplaining it. A conception of hypnosis which limited its manifesta\ntions to simple automatic movements was comparatively easy to\nexplain. The hypnotic subject, who, while he has not lost the\ns 2\n\f258 Dr. J. Milne Bramwell.\nphysical and mental powers of his waking condition, has acquired new\nand far-reaching ones, presents a very difficult problem. But normal\nlife contains many problems, both physiological and psychological,\nwhich are yet unsolved and some\u2014 such as the causal connection\nbetween mental and physical states,\u2014which are apparently insoluble,\nand while this is so, it would be unreasonable to expect a complete\nexplanation of that still more complex state\u2014 the hypnotic. Further\nobservation is always giving us clearer insight, if not into the central\nproblem itself, at all events into the phenomena which characterise\nit. What increased practical advantage this may give us in curing\ndisease, alleviating pain, or improving moral states, time alone will\nshow. Meanwhile it is reasonable to hope that increased knowledge\nmay bring with it increased power.\n\fSome Experiments in Crystal-Vision. 259\nIII.\nSOME EXPERIMENTS IN CRYSTAL-VISION.\nBy Professor James H. Hyslop,\nof Columbia College, New York.\nFrom a series of notes taken at the time I report the following\nresults of experiments in crystal vision.1\nIn the course of my conversation with the percipient, Mrs. D ,\nregarding her various experiences, she happened to mention that, when\na child, if she happened to look at the surface of a lake or body of\nwater reflecting sunlight, she often saw the most beautiful scenes not\nin any way representing the objects about her. I at once thought of\nthe resemblance between this and the visions of crystal-gazing, and\nresolved to try experiments in this with her. I procured a crystal and\ngave it to Mrs. D , with information as to how it should be used.\nAfter having tried the experiment and found it successful, Mrs. D\ntold me that when I asked her to try the crystal, she both resented such\nexperiments and utterly disbelieved that anything would result from\nthem. She therefore felt very greatly surprised when distinct visions\nwere produced by the crystal. When she tried it for the first time\nand a scene appeared, she suspected that it was either a reflection of\nsome surrounding objects or an illusion produced by such a reflection.\nBut by changing her own position, or the position of the crystal, the\nsame scene would continue to appear in it. Most generally she shifted\nthe crystal about in various positions, but the act would not change\nthe vision, which remained constant in spite of alterations in position,\nuntil some new scene presented itself with a like continuity under\nvarious circumstances.\nAnother fact of considerable interest in the case is that some\ntimes the vision appears on the surface of the crystal and sometimes\nat the centre of it, and gradually develops into clearness. And again\nit will sometimes originate in this way at the centre and be transferred\nto the surface. But the distinction between the two kinds of vision is\nvery clear to Mrs. D . Sometimes when the scene appears at the\ncentre of the crystal, turning the glass will bring the same picture to\nthe surface. Mrs. I) is not sure that she can detect any difference\n1 This Report was written in November, 1895.\n\f260 Professor James H. Hyslop.\nof meaning between the two kinds of vision. Indeed there has been\nno reason to attach any meaning to any of them until investigation\nsuggested a possible significance in two or three of them ; and as no\nrecord was kept of those which appeared at the centre of the crystal,\nand of those that appeared at the surface, it is not possible at this\ndate to say whether any of those which investigation some months\nafterward showed might be veridical were those at the centre or those\nat the surface of the glass. That they are not representations of the\nimagination is evident from Mrs. D 's deliberate attempt to\nprevent a vision from developing when it once began to appear. She\nsays that in spite of both her repugnance to the experiments and\nresistance to the occurrence of the visions, they came irresistibly and\nrepresented often such absurd positions, attitudes and congeries of\nfacts, events, or scenes, that nothing but the dream-world resembled\nthem. This characteristic will be apparent in the description of them.\nThere are three series of them, obtained at different times and\nnumbered in their order. But as nothing of an apparently telepathic\nnature occurred, or having any other kind of supernormal psychological\nsignificance, the experiments were suspended and not resumed. The\nfollowing is an account of what was seen in the crystal, with the dates\nwhen the experiments were made :\u2014\nFebruary 18th, 1895, p.m.\n1. An iceberg floating in the water.\n2. A sunset view, with the observer looking over a hill upon a bank of\nclouds surrounding the setting sun.\n3. A human head lying on a pillow with the mouth very wide open.\n4. The face of Mrs. D 's mother.\n5. A woman and child lying in bed with face uncovered and bed clothes\npulled up to the neck.\n6. An interesting and complicated scene, comprising a house resembling\none in which a relative had lived, and partly concealed by a ledge of cliff\nrocks (not connected with the relative's house) ; one gable end of the house\nseemed to have fallen out or [been] cut open, and various persons, including\nchildren, men, and women, were coming out of this opening and returning\ninto it. To the left of the house were two objects like two tall posts. No\nfaces were recognised.\n7. The entrance to a cemetery, which resembled the cemetery known by\nMrs. D at her old home in Ohio. But the appearance of it, beyond the\ngate and wall with the tombstones and monuments, represented it as\ndifferent from what it was as Mrs. D had known it.\n8. A person kneeling before a covered bier, and a face looking over the\nbier toward the one kneeling before it.\n9. Face with large nose and thin sunken lips.\nMarch 20th, 1895.\n10. Face of a Mr. D. who had been Mrs. D. 's pastor in P , Ohio,\nand whom Mrs. D. had not seen for fifteen years until two or three years\nfrom date in New York, and then had seen him frequently after this. But\n\fSome Experiments in Crystal-Vision. 261\nlie appeared as he had been known in Ohio. When the face appeared the\neyes were closed, the mouth open and the teeth gnashing. Not very clear\nat first, but when it developed into distinctness Mrs. D. involuntarily\nexclaimed, \"Why, Mr. D.\" But when the crystal was turned the face\nvanished quickly and other faces took its place. Before Mr. D.'s face\nappeared, however, there was a very slight picture of a cemetery which\ncould be described only as a dream of a dream, it was so vague.\nApril 6th, 1895. 7\u20148 p.m.\n11. A lady playing at a piano.\n12. Lady holding an infant, and a child near by looking at the child.\n13. A street with pavement and houses, and a child knocking at a white\ndoor.\n14. Lady standing at the left of an open trunk, holding up the lid with\nthe right hand and stooping over to take out something with the left hand.\nThe position was very unusual.\n15. A little boy holding a baby in his arms.\n16. A child lying asleep on a bed.\n17. A man lying on a bed with a diamond shirt stud in his shirt bosom,\nhis head concealed from view by the head board. Behind the bed stood a\nmirror or screen, and on the wall hung a picture.\n18. A man propped up in bed with a pillow, and trying to write.\nApril 8th, 1895. 11.30-12 m.\n19. A landscape representing a cow path entering a pair of bars into a\nfield, and trees, bushes, and stones on the right side of the bars.\n20. One of the most interesting of the series.\nA room with tiling on the floor and on one of the walls. The other wall\nwas in shadow, apparently caused by streaming sunlight passing through a\ncoloured glass window deeply set in the wall near the corner of the room.\nInto this stream of light suddenly flew a dove. The scene was a very\nbrilliant one, and resembled that of a fine painting of a view in a mediaeval\ncastle or church. The tiling on the wall had cross marks in the pieces.\n21. An abrupt rocky and dark cliff somewhat resembling an island with\nclefts at the left hand through which the sun shone upon some water and in\nthe face of a man who was in the act of rising from a lying posture.\n22. The head and face of a man with bushy beard and hair.\n23. A bridge across a moat or canal with shipping and houses beyond,\nsuch as are often seen in large cities.\nNot having found that these images represented any known\nexperience in her life, or that they had any other significance, the\nexperiments were not continued. The visions were all very clear and\nbrilliant.\nThe problem that of course suggested itself to me was, first,\nwhether these visions represented the reproduction of anything once\nseen or experienced by Mrs D ; second, whether there was, in\ndefault of the first explanation, any evidence of supernormally\nacquired knowledge ; and third, whether they were merely induced\nhallucinations.\n\f262 Professor James H. Hyslop.\nOn questioning Mrs. D about her memory of any of the scenes,\nher emphatic reply was that she could not remember any of them,\nexcept two or three faces, and the one (No. 7) resembling a cemetery\nwhich she had known in Ohio, but which was so unlike it in other\nrespects that she would not assert the identity. All other pictures were\npurely productions of her mind, so far as she knew. I reflected upon\nthe cases for several days, and it suddenly occurred to me that possibly\nMrs. D , being a very religious woman, may have often seen, and\nperhaps been interested in at some time, a picture which is very common\nin Bibles, or was at one time, and in other religious books, namely, a\npicture of a dove flying in the beams of sunlight. I asked Mrs. D\nwhether she remembered ever seeing such a picture, and she replied that\nshe did not recall anything of the kind. But Mr. D soon remarked\nthat they had a Bible and had had it for a long time, on which was just\nsuch a picture. Mrs. D then remembered the book, but could not\nrecall having noticed or thought of the picture. The peculiarity of the\ncase (No. 20), however, is that the crystal-vision resembled this picture\nin no respect except that of the dove flying in the sunbeams. In all\nbut this it was like a reproduction of some picture in an art gallery.\nI remember myself having seen one very much like Mrs. D 's\ndrawing in the Dresden Gallery, but Mrs. D has never been in\nDresden. I asked her whether she had ever seen such a picture in any\nAmerican gallery, store, or house, and she replied that she had not, so\nfar as her recollection went. It may, therefore, be a purely spontaneous\ncreation of the mind. But whether it be this, or the reproduction of\nsome forgotten visual experience, the chief interest lies in the sudden\nappearance of a dove in the sunbeams, a phenomenon which seems to\nshow subliminal association between two totally distinct pictures.\nThe streaming sunlight in the picture seems, through suggestion, to\nhave called up the hallucination of the dove, which had probably been\nseen at one time in the picture on the Bible, and was here connected\nwith a scene to which it had never belonged in reality.\nA.t this point the matter stood without farther investigation, since\nno clue to a similar interpretation of the other scenes could be obtained.\nNo recollection of them was possible to Mrs. D . But another\nexperience of hers increases the probability that the scenes are\nreproduced past experiences without recognition. Mrs. D used\noften to have a visual hallucination of a bright blue sky overhead, a\ngarden with a high walled fence, and a peculiar chain pump in the\ngarden situated at the back of a house. She attached no significance\nto it, but took it for one of the many automatisms in her experience\nwhich were without assignable meaning to her. But two summers ago\nshe had gone out west to her old home in D , Ohio, and made the\nacquaintance of a lady whom she had never known before, and by\n\fSome Experiments in Crystal-Vision. 263\nchance was invited to take tea with her one evening. She went, and\nafter tea remarked that she would like to have a drink of water. The\nlady of the house remarked : \" All right, let us go out into the garden\nand get a fresh drink from the well.\" They went, and behold here\nwas the identical blue sky, high fence, and chain pump which she had\nso often seen in her vision. After going home in the evening, Mrs.\nD told her mother of her experience, remarking how strange it\nwas. Her mother replied that when Mrs. D was a little girl\nabout two or three years old she used to visit this house very\nfrequently with her. Here, then, is a case of spontaneous reproduc\ntion without recognition. Mrs. D has had one other similar\nexperience connected with the events of her early childhood.1\nPerhaps one remark ought to be made on number six (No. 6) of\nthe visions. The form and shape of the house were very familiar to\nMrs. D , being those of a relative's. But the cliff of stone and\nthe opening in the gable end were no part of the house and its locality\nas she knew them.\nBut there are two cases which are interesting as coincidences. The\nfirst of these is the vision of the entrance to the old cemetery in Ohio\n(No. 7).\nThis last summer, July and August, 1895, Mrs. D visited her\nold home in D , Ohio. Now it must be remembered in this\ni connection that all the crystal-visions occurred during the illness of\nMrs. D 's brother, who lived in Ohio, and I report below some coin\ncidences occurring at the time between Mrs. D 's automatisms and\nthe condition of her brother. One of them was that a postal card or\nletter was written by him saying that he was propped up in bed writing,\nand this was somewhere near the time when her crystal-vision (No. 18)\nof a man in this position occurred. But there was no recognition of\nher brother's form in it. However, I lay no stress upon this incident,\nexcept to mention that it prompted Mrs. D to make inquiries\n1 Mrs. D gives the following account, written in 1893, of these experiences :\u2014\n\"A few years ago I was visiting my mother. I said, 'Mother, I dreamed of being\nin some place last night. It seemed so real, I want to tell it to yon.' After telling\nher of the house, the queer garden, etc., mother told me I had been there, but that\nI was a very small child when I made my visit.\n\"Through the early years of my life a place came to my mind so vividly [that] it\nseemed I surely had seen it. Sometimes it came when awake, sometimes in sleep.\nWhen about 20 years old I became acquainted with a lady friend. I was at her house\nto tea. After tea I asked for water. She said ' Come on, we will get some fresh.' I\nfollowed her and came out into the square with frame walls all around, the blue sky\nabove, and there was the old chain pump. I had seen the same place and pump many\ntimes in thought, and many times had looked up at the blue sky above. I told mother\nof my experience and of the former thoughts of the place. She said, ' Yes, Eva ;\nyou were there visiting when a little girl.' I know I was not five years old, perhaps\nonly three. Mother said her cousin used to live in the house.\"\n\f264 Professor James H. Hyslop.\nabout various things to determine whether there were any coincidences\nin the other cases of crystal-vision. Since her parents and sister did\nnot like to believe in her experiences as more than fancies, Mrs. D\ndid not tell them her experiments, but questioned them carefully in\nregard to what occurred during her brother's illness, all in a way\nmerely to satisfy a sort of gossipy curiosity and without arousing\nsuspicion as to her motives. She found, in her own judgment,\nseveral coincidences between the thoughts of her sister and brother and\nherself at the time of the crystal-vision, one of which is interesting.\nMrs. D visited the old cemetery purposely to see how far it\nresembled her crystal-vision of it. To her astonishment the resemblance\nwas complete. The tombstones and monuments which appeared in the\nvision, and which she had never seen, or could not recall seeing, were\nthere with the entrance, precisely as they appeared in the vision.\nThey\u2014the monuments, not the entrance\u2014were recent additions to the\ncemetery, and since the time when Mrs. D\u2014\u2014 had seen it many years\nago. Mrs. D inquired very carefully whether her sister had had\nthe cemetery in mind during the brother's illness. The brother had\nsuffered from a relapse of typhoid fever ; all hope of his recovery had\nbeen abandoned by his relatives, and Mrs. D was ready to respond\nto a summons at any time to attend the funeral. The family burial\nplace was not in this particular cemetery, but in another graveyard\nnow in a rather dilapidated condition. As most of the family were\nstill living and a new lot might seem desirable, the sister said she\noften thought, during her brother's illness, that they ought to purchase\na new lot in this better kept cemetery, and was ready to propose\nit in case of her brother's death. In this way was established\nthe fact that the cemetery was often in the sister's mind, and she\nknew from familiarity the exact appearance of the entrance to it.\nIt is possible, therefore, to account for the crystal-vision by telepathic\ninfluences, if we accept such a fact and if we attach any value to the\ncoincidence.\nThe second case in which the coincidence may have some interest\nwas that of the fifth crystal-vision (No. 5). This was that of a woman\nand child lying in bed. This vision occurred during the illness of\nMrs. D 's brother and during her mental anxiety about him. The\npeculiarity about it is that Mrs. D thought of her sister-in-law, her\nsick brother's wife, and recognised her form and appearance about\nthe head, but could not recognise the face. But she knew no reason to\naccount for the presence of a baby in bed with the sister-in-law. When\nshe was visiting her brother during the summer, as referred to above,\nshe learned from his wife that he, during the illness, was constantly\ntroubled with the illusion that she had given birth to a child, and\ncould not be divested of it. He often referred to the circumstance,\n\fSome Experiments in Crystal-Vision. 265\nand insisted in a delirious condition on seeing the child, when, as a\nmatter of fact, there was no reason in the case for his belief.\nBut strict science, before it can attach evidential value to the\ncoincidences, must be able to record more accurately the time of the\nthoughts which are assumed to be the cause of the vision. The\nabsence of this feature from the case very greatly diminishes the value\nof the instances for the purposes to which we might wish to put them\nas evidence. But the cases are, of course, such that there was no\nchance to obtain the definite kuowledge, and we are left with just\nenough coincidence to make us laugh and wonder, while we entertain\na sceptical attitude in regard to their significance. In this they are\nillustrations of those frequent coincidences, occurring spontaneously,\nto which it is impossible to give scientific completeness, and which can\nhave no value until they are multiplied so numerously and under such\nvarying conditions as to make us doubt the influence of chance. In\nthese instances, however, we are certainly shut off from the kind of\nevidence which strict scientific method demands, until it be otherwise\nshown that telepathy does not depend upon chronological coincidences.\n[Mrs. D , as Professor Hyslop mentions, has had a large number\nof psychical experiences, which he had been engaged in investigating\nfor some time before his account of her crystal-visions was written.\nThey were fully reported by him in a series of letters to Dr. Hodgson,\nand it will be interesting in connection with the above to give some of\nthe best authenticated cases. We quote here extracts from Professor\nHyslop's letters, with statements by Mr. and Mrs. D . Ed.]\n(1)\nMr. D.'s Statement.\nMay Wh, 1893.\nI was a Sophomore, or Junior, at . The Young Ladies' Institute\nwas at the foot of \" the Hill \" on one of the streets that led from the College\nto the main street of the village.\nOne of the girls, looking from the window of her room, saw a student\npassing. She knew neither his name nor his aim in life. I am not certain\nthat she had ever noticed him particularly. If at all, it was simply as a\nstudent and member of the church choir. She felt that the young man was\ntempted to cease studying for the ministry, and choose some other calling.\nSomething told her to pray for him. She did, of course. Fear kept her\nfrom asking the other \" Sem.\" girls who the stranger was, or what profession\nhe had chosen. Not many days afterwards he led a prayer meeting in the\nchurch. After meeting she managed to pluck up courage to ask his name.\nNot till later did she learn of his calling. As the young student had no\ncompany he cared especially for, he secured an introduction to this young\nlady through a mutual lady friend.\n\f266 Professor James H. Hyslop.\nI think it was during his first call that he was startled with the question,\n\"Were you ever tempted to give up studying for the ministry?\" She\nafterwards told him how he acted and what he said. He could remember\nneither his actions nor his words. After several minutes' thought and\nwalking across the room, he returned to her side and simply asked her,\n\" Why do you ask that question 1 \" Then she explained her impression and\nher act. He then told her how a short time back he was inclined, not to\ncease studying for the ministry, formally, but to study for a Greek\nprofessorship, which would of course be a practical abandonment of the\nministry. But he assured her that he had told no human being of this\nthought before that afternoon.\nHow did she know my mental experience 1 Were my thoughts\ntransferred to her ? Am inclined to think I had noticed her particularly\namong the other ladies of the Institute and desired her acquaintance, but I\ndid not intend to tell her that which in some way she had learned.\nMrs. D.'s Account.\nJune 15th, 1893.\nThe incident mentioned by my husband to Dr. Hyslop proved so inter\nesting that he has asked me to give it more in detail. First I should remark\nthat Mr. D. was not quite accurate in the particulars of his account, though\ncorrect in the main incident. My own memory also can be refreshed by\nreference to my journal, which I kept at that time, and had kept for a long\ntime before, and we have kept since. But, as I remember the experience, it\nwas somewhat as follows.\n1 have always been of a devoutly religious turn of mind, and so accustomed\nto give such incidents a religious meaning. When this occurred, I did not\nknow that it had any special scientific value, and remembered it only as a\nvery remarkable experience, and do not recall ever alluding to it to any one\nexcept my husband. It took place a number of years ago, the exact date,\nwhich was October 5th, 1879, being found in my journal of that time. On\nthat evening, before retiring for the night, I was reading my Bible, as was\nmy usual custom, and suddenly saw the vision of a face appear before\nme. I had raised my head up from the Bible, and was looking toward the\nwall. The face was that of a gentleman whom I afterwards felt that I must\nhave seen among the students of University, of the same place, but\nhaving no connection with the ladies' seminary. I should also say that the\nface did not appear to be an ordinary memory picture, representing a strong\nimpression, but was projected beyond me and externalised, so that it seemed\nquite as real as any actual person would seem. At the same time, the vision\nwas accompanied by a voice indicating very distinctly that the gentleman\nwas tempted and that I should pray for him.\nThe voice which 1 mention here was quite as real as the vision. It said :\n\"He's tempted, pray for him.\" What the temptation was in particular did\nnot come to me until I was in the midst of my prayer on my knees, and then\nit was that he was tempted to abandon the ministry. The voice I heard was\none that enables me to understand why the negroes and some other\nenthusiasts say at times that the Lord tells them audibly certain things\nthey narrate for revelations,\u2014a fact I mention in order to indicate that the\n\fSome Experiments in Crystal -Vision. 267\nvoice was more than an impression in my mind. I can always distinguish\nthe two, such experiences being frequent. But the particular temptation\ncame to me as a thought, and not as a voice.\nThe thought seemed very irrelevant and foolish to me, and I tried to\npass it by. But it was too insistent to be thus disposed of. I therefore\nobeyed the feeling that I should pray for him, though 1 had never met the\nperson and did not even know [his] name. Such an occurrence had no\nspecial meaning to me other than a religious one. But I could not under\nstand why his temptation to abandon his studies for the ministry, if any\nperson was so tempted, could or should be revealed to me in this way. But\nat any rate, the impression was so vivid and my curiosity so aroused, that I\nresolved to try and find the student represented by it. I was afraid to say\nanything to my schoolmates about the experience, for fear they would laugh\nat me for having a special interest in this person, and so I kept the whole\nmatter sacredly to myself, all the while improving every opportunity to try\nthe identification and verification of the impression. Some time afterward I\nrecognised the person at an entertainment, as he stepped upon the platform,\nbut would not say anything about it. Later I was at a prayer-meeting where\nhe led the exercises, and by this time I mustered up courage to ask some\none what his name was. On the same evening I found also that he was a\nstudent for the ministry. This excited my curiosity still more, but I had no\nimmediate means of gratifying it. It was several months later before I met\nhim, and then rather by accident on my part. It was at one of the young\nladies' society entertainments. But nothing was said of my experience to\nthe gentleman for obvious reasons. It was not until several months\nafterward that the matter was mentioned between us. In the mean time, we\nfrequently met each other. But when it was mentioned, it occurred in a\nsingular way. We were talking over a Sunday school lesson concerning\ntemptation together, when I happened to tell him what my experience had\nbeen. He at once arose from his seat, and looking as pale as a sheet,\nwalked backward and forward for a few minutes, stepped to the window\nand looked out, and then returned to his seat, when he remarked : \" Well,\nE., that is the strangest thing I ever heard. I guess the Lord must have\nmeant you for my guardian angel.\" He then confessed that he had, some\ntime before, been tempted to abandon his study for the ministry, during the\nvery period in the midst of which I had my experience. But by this time\nhe had concluded to continue his studies, and not to be tempted by a career\nin a Greek professorship. My experience then had taken place while he was\nin his mental struggle, and long before I had any opportunity to verify it\npersonally and without any knowledge of the facts which it represented,\nespecially as Mr. D. himself had not mentioned the fact of his temptation\nto any one.\nMr. D. adds :\u2014\nJune 15th, 1893.\nI remember distinctly that I was interested in Mrs. D. (then Miss B.), be\nfore we met, having seen her frequently among the students of the Seminary.\nMy interest was a strong one, and could easily have been romantic. I also\nremember quite confidently that, while passing through my mental struggle,\nI wondered what she would think, if 1 thought of abandoning the ministry,\n\f2G8 Professor James H. Hydop.\nand which she would prefer, a fact that may indicate the strength of my\ninterest in her, and for which there was no reason, except the attraction [she]\nhad for [me]. In regard to the temptation to abandon the study for the\nministry, I can say that it was brought on by my pleasure in the study of\nGreek. It was understood that I was destined for the pulpit, and the sense\nof honour I felt about it came into conflict with the desire to devote myself to\nthe Greek language ; and so for several months I was sorely tempted to choose\nthe latter. After a severe struggle I finally decided to abide by my first\nresolutions, and kept the mental struggle to myself. I told no one about it,\nso that there was no opportunity for Miss B. to hear of it, and even if she\nhad, it would have had no meaning to her, because we were entire strangers\nto each other. My astonishment can then be imagined when, some months\nlater, she told me of her experience, revealing the fact which I had concealed\nso carefully.\nProfessor Hyslop's Report.\nColumbia College, New York, June 16th, 1893.\nMrs. D.'s present written account was taken down yesterday by myself\nfrom her own statements, and is identical with the story she told me on the\n7th instant, when I called to learn more about it than Mr. D.'s letter\nindicated.\nMr. D. merely mentioned the incident, and on my request for more details,\nreplied that he and his wife had talked it over, and that he found several more\ndetails of interest in it. I then made an arrangement to see them on the\nafternoon of the 7th instant. In the mean time, Mrs. D. suspected that she\nmight have mentioned the experience in her journal which she had kept at\nthe time and before she was in college, and on examination found that she\nhad done so on the very night of its occurrence, the 5th of October, 1879.\nShe said nothing of the fact to her husband, and he was entirely ignorant\nof the existence of the journal until she mentioned her consultation of\nit to me in his presence, when he expressed his surprise. She then told\nme the details of her experience, as I have given them, and I took down\nthe journal for the 5th of October, 1879. I emphasized the value of the\nincident on the ground of the recorded evidence, and urged her to write out\na full account of it. From my account of such phenomena and the meaning\nof them her curiosity was aroused, and she wondered whether her journal\nsaid anything more about it. She referred to it again, and to her own\nsurprise, found all the other entries which I have appended. I give below\nthe various entries in the journal, indicating by dots the existence of matter\nnot connected with the case at all.\n\" October 5th, 1879.\u2014On this eve, while sitting in my room, a face that\nI have seen present at our meetings came before my vision so plain that I am\nimpressed that this person is, or has been, suffering temptation. It seems to\nme that he has in time past felt that he should study for the ministry, and is\nnow tempted to give up this idea. I felt impressed that I must pray for him.\nThen the thought came to me,\u2014strange that I should have such a feeling, for\nI do not even know the name, but how plainly I see his face. I have prayed,\nand earnestly, although for a stranger, yes, a perfect stranger. After arising\nfrom my knees, I soliloquised thus : I wonder who he is ; if he is studying for\nthe ministry. Why should these feelings come to me 1 I mean to find out.\"\n\fSome Experiments in Crystal-Vision. 269\n\"October 18th [1879].\u2014Several of us attended the rhetorical exercises in\nHall. Since the 5th of this month I have been endeavouring to find\nout the name of the dark-eyed stranger spoken of. To-day I heard his name\nspoken when called on for his recitation. I found myself becoming much\ninterested in this person. I pray for him daily, for I feel that he needs my\nprayers \"\n\" October 28th, [1879].\u2014Attended prayer meeting in the B. P. Church.\nThe dark-eyed stranger that I am praying for led the meeting. While he\nwas reading, talking and praying, I sat silently praying for him. Since\nOctober 5th, I have found out that he is studying for the ministry. I feel so\nanxious to become acquainted with him, and ask him whether he has been\nsuffering temptation concerning his studying for the ministry. I wonder if\nwe will ever be permitted to meet ? . . . .\"\n[ This last question was prompted by the strictness of the rules which\nkept the students of both institutions from meeting except on rare\noccasions.]\n\" December 5th.\u2014Attended the Society. I met my stranger. . . .\"\n[The Society here alluded to was the Philharmonic of the Seminary.]\n\" February 7ih, 1880.\u2014Mr. D. called at the Sem. During the afternoon\nI told him my feelings on October 5th, and he said that he had been suffering\ntemptation concerning studying for the ministry. . . .\"\nOf Mr. and Mrs. D 1 can say that they are both educated people, and\nof very respectable intelligence, non-believers in Spiritualism and not super\nstitious, unless a belief in special providences must be so interpreted. Mr.\nD. is a Baptist minister, engaged in mission work in , and has attended\nmy lectures at Columbia College this school year, and I have found him\nintellectually a careful and cautious man on all matters of scientific facts and\ntheories. Mrs. D. is equally so, though perhaps her tendency to give many\nof her peculiar experiences a special meaning might be regarded as due to\nmental incautiousness. But I found her without any explanation of some\nof them and curious to know if psychology could account for them. In fact,\nthere was only one class of her impressions, of which she has had many, that\nseemed to her to have a definitely religious import. I can understand how,\nin the absence of a knowledge of telepathy, a religious mind might give a\nserious import to many of the impressions mentioned to me, and this\nwithout in the least being suspected of or chargeable with a weak judgment.\nI found her memory for small things very good, and this in regard to\nordinary events in her life [which] have no significance whatever. Her\nordinary perceptions are evidently very vivid, and she does not fail to\nremember them down to the smallest details.\nShe very often hears a voice, which quite uniformly is connected\nwith her religious life. It is nearly always a command to pray. Sometimes\nit is merely a conviction or thought. She distinguishes very clearly between\nthem, and did so spontaneously and without any question from me. It was\na matter of curiosity to herself that there should be this peculiar difference\nbetween the impressions, some being sensible, as it were, and others merely\nintellectual. The voice in these instances is perfectly audible to herself,\nthough apparently less vivid than common sounds. These are the cases\nwhich have seemed to her to have a personally religious import, simply\n\f270 Professor James H. Hyslop.\nbecause they happened to concur with a devotional life, and occur at times\nwhen she feels some special need, and apparently in response to it.\n(2)\nMrs. D.'s Account.\nJanuary 20th, 1894.\nOn the night of June 26\u201427, here in [N.Y.], I had a dream which\nimpressed me so that I noted [it] down the next day, the following being the\ndetails of the journal.\n\"Tuesday, June 27th, 1893.\n\"Several weeks ago I felt impressed to write to aunt R., an aunt I have\nnot seen for eight years and have not heard from for a long time\u2014never\nreceived a letter myself from her nor [ever] wrote to her. She con\ntinued in my mind for two days and a night. I neglected writing. Last\nnight I saw, in dreams, aunt A., (the aunt with whom R. lives). We were\nin the cemetery [P , Ohio] ; aunt held in her arms a little child. The\nground was disturbed for some distance. It seemed that she was trying to\nmake room by putting the little one across the foot of the grave, as one\nwould place a little one across the foot of the bed. I said, ' Who is it 1\u2014\nBerdie 1 ' (a little one she had lost years ago.) Aunt was covering the earth\ncarefully around the little form and crying as if her heart would break.\nWhile sitting at my sewing this morning, I thought of my dream and how\nstrange it was. My mind was on aunt A., when a voice said 'Aunt R. is\ndead.' I will write this eve.\"\nThe letter which I wrote to my aunt that evening contained the following\nextract, which was the only reference I made to my dream.\n\"June 27th, 1893.\n\"I write to you because I saw you in my dreams last night with such a\ntroubled face. If you do not feel like writing, let some one else write, that\nI may know you are all well.\"\nThis extract I copied from the letter before sending it and placed it on\nthe same page with the journal of the dream.\nIt is of interest to remark that I have not been in correspondence with\nmy aunt, and have had no communication with the family for six or eight\nyears. The last communication from one of the members was not a very\npleasant one, and hence we had no means of following up each other's lives.\nOn the 10th of July I went west and arrived at D -, Ohio, about six\no'clock in the evening of the 11th of July. I was met by my sister at the\nstation, and asked her how all the folks were, using the expressions, '' Are\nall well ? Is father well ?\" She replied in regard to father, \" Not very, he\nis down to P , G. is dead.\" I had asked this question because\nbetween the date of my dream and this time I had frequently seemed to see\nmy father's face and it wore such a pitiful look.\nProfessor Hyslop's Report.\nBrooklyn, N.Y., January 20th, 1894.\nThere were a number of incidents in connection with the dream which\nMrs. D. did not mention in the journal. The first of these was that, as she\n\fSome Experiments in Crystal-Vision. 271\nsat at her work table the morning after the dream, she wondered if any\none was sick, and thought it was her aunt's youngest, G., but she was\nuncertain in her feelings about it ; and about an hour after a clairaudient voice\nseemed to say that it was aunt R. , which was all wrong. But she could not,\nin her hesitation as to the person dead, feel that it was any one but G., and\nyet uncertainty hovered about this.\nThe week before the dream her cousin N., the sister of the child who had\ndied, was frequently in Mrs. D.'s mind, and twice she sat down to write to\nher, but failed because she finally thought that her cousin would not care to hear\nfrom her after the long estrangement between them. (I should also say at\nthis point that G. had expressed a desire to be at peace with all her relatives\nand to forget all the past differences that had given rise to estrangement.)\nMrs. D. said that in thinking about her cousin all this time before the dream,\nshe felt that she (the cousin) must be in trouble. It was only a vague feeling\nwithout any definite contents that would convey to her what was the cause\nof it. It was only after Mrs. D. 's arrival at D , some weeks later, she\nlearned that her cousin was very anxious at the time of the dream about a\nlittle son, sick with the scarlet fever.\nI will add that on July 15th, Mr. D., who remained behind in ,\nafter his wife's departure for the West, wrote me a postal card, which I still\nhave, and among its contents is a reference to the dream about the death of\nher aunt's child and the corroboration of it. He alludes to her having made a\njournal of it before going West, and before learning of the facts.\nNew York, February 3rd, 1894.\nMrs. D. in answer to my further inquiries, tells me that the child died of\nspinal meningitis, at M , Wisconsin, whither she had gone on a visit.\nHer mother did not live there, but had gone thither to nurse her daughter.\nThe accompanying obituary notice shows that the child had died on July 8th,\n1893, [aged 16] and was buried on July 10th. This places her death at twelve\ndays, and her burial at fourteen days, after the dream. She was buried at\nP , Ohio, and Mrs. D. informs me herself that she is not familiar with\nthe lot where the grave is situated.\nNew York, March Uth, 1894.\nI wrote to Mrs. D.'s cousin in M , Wisconsin, at whose home the girl\ndied, and submitted the following questions to be answered, bearing upon\nthe possible mental anxiety of the mother at the time of Mrs. D.'s dream,\ntwo weeks before her cousin's death. I give the answer of my correspondent\nafter each question.\n1. \"How long was Miss G. sick?\" Answer. \"Two weeks and from\nWednesday to Saturday.\"\n2. \" Where was her mother when she heard of the daughter's sickness i\"\nAnswer. \"At home, P , Ohio.\"\n3. ' 1 How long before her daughter's death did the mother know that the\nillness was a dangerous one ? \" Answer. \" From the time she came.\"\n4. \" How long was Mrs. G., the mother, with her daughter before the\nlatter's death ? \" Answer. \" Two weeks and two days.\"\n5. \"How was the mother informed of the sickness?\" Answer. \"By\ntelegram.\"\nT\n\f272 Professor James H. Hyslop.\nTo one of the questions was also added the remark that \" the doctors\nsaid she (the daughter) would not die, but Ma said she knew she would from\nthe first,\" a fact which must be remembered when reading another incident\nwhich I have still to narrate. But it will be noted in the answer to my\nquestion that the mother's consciousness of her daughter's danger and her\nmental anxiety preceded the death long enough to coincide with the dream\nof Mrs. D., and that is sufficient to take the case out of the class of\npremonitions.\nBut now in addition to the answers from the sister I learn the following\ninteresting facts, volunteered by the sister, now Mrs. A., in M ,\nWisconsin. She writes me that on the Wednesday night that her sister\ntook sick, June 21st, the sick sister had the following experience, which I\nshall narrate in Mrs. A.'s own words. We have only to remember that Miss\nG., the sister, had been taken from school and sent to Wisconsin, as the\nnarrative indicates, on account of some threatened ill-health, and had been\nabsent from home since March, 1893. This explains the separation of\nmother and daughter. Now for Mrs. A.'s account.\n\"March 9th, 1894.\n\"Sister G. took sick Wednesday. [June 21st.] She had not been well\nsince November [1892]. They took her out of school and sent her here, but\nshe was very much better from the time she came, in March, until she took\nsick the Wednesday I spoke of. Wednesday she had not been able to sit\nup all day, but we just thought it sick headache. About ten o'clock at night,\nI had not retired, she was sleeping nicely. All at once she jumped out of\nbed and came out in the room where I was, crying. I asked what was the\nmatter. She said, ' Mamma is calling me. I dreamed so plainly of hearing\nher call me.' That same night about the same time, mamma was asleep [in\nP , Ohio,] and she thought G. called her. She answered, ' Yes, I'll\ncome.' Then that woke Papa and he woke her. She said she knew\nsomething was wrong with G. The next morning we sent the telegram for\nher to come.\n\"Another thing was very queer, I think. The doctors said sister was not\ngoing to die. Ma said as soon as she saw her she would not live. We sent\nword home as the doctors said. Well, Wednesday before she died, [which\nwas on] Saturday, she was better. We sent them word to that effect and\nhad sent no other word. At 11 o'clock Saturday morning Papa, (he was in\nP , Ohio) said to my other sister, ' G. is dying.' She said, ' Why no,\nshe is better.' A little while after he said 'She is dead,' and she died at\n20 minutes after 11 o'clock.\n(Signed) \"Mrs. L. H. A.\"\nThe family of Miss G. refused to give Professor Hyslop any further\ninformation in this case.\n(3)\nMrs. D.'s Account.\nJanuary 20th, 1894.\nAbout the first of this month, I had a dream which was connected with\nmy sister, the youngest daughter in our family. I dreamed that I was with\nthis sister attending a funeral at my mother's house. The person at whoso\n\fSome Experiments in Crystal-Vision. 273\nfuneral I was present seemed to be an entire stranger to me. I seemed to\nsee the coffin placed with the head to the West, in the only position in which\nit could be placed. The face of the corpse was round, full and plump. The\nhair was dark and pushed back from the forehead. The person seemed to be\nabout maturity. But I could not recognise her as any one in my acquaint\nance. Only I remember that the face was an unusual one, as persons of that\nage have a sort of sameness that prevents the drawing clearly the differences\nbetween them in expression. But in this case the expression was striking\nas that of a stranger, the forehead appearing intellectual. The face was pale\nbut not sunken as a corpse appears usually.\nTwo or three days afterwards I received the following letter from my\nsister.\n\"D , Ohio, January 2nd, 1893 [94.]\n\"Dear E.,\u2014It seems rather strange for me to be writing a letter at one\no'clock in the morning, but that is just what I am doing. N. Mc E. came\ninto our house this afternoon and took a chill, and has been very sick. She\nhas had La Grippe and I guess it is a kind of relapse\u2014she was very delirious\nall evening and has to have medicine every half-hour part of the night and\nevery hour the rest. . . .\nTour sister, P.\"\nUnfortunately I cannot at this date remember distinctly whether my\ndream occurred precisely at the time my sister was writing to me. I only\nremember that when I received the letter and opened it, and before reading\nit, I exclaimed, \" Just night before last I dreamed of her.\" When I read\nthe letter it occurred to me that the coincidence would be of interest to Dr.\nHyslop, and I wondered if the stranger's face really looked as it appeared in\nthe dream.\nProfessor Hyslop's Report.\nNew York, April 2nd, 1894.\nI have just received a letter from Mrs. D.'s sister, [as follows] :\n\" D , Ohio, March 29th, 1894.\n\"Dr. Hyslop,\u2014I have just been able to learn the date of the night of\nwhich you spoke in your letter. It was the evening of January 9th that I\nwrote to Mrs. D. and I think about half-past eleven when I finished the\nletter. The young lady of which you spoke has blue eyes, almost black\ncurly hair which was coiled on the back of her head. At some time before\nmidnight [I] took down her hair and braided it so that it would rest on the\npillow. The young lady has naturally a very full round face, and did not\nlook at all wasted at the time.\"\nThe following is a second letter in regard to the same matter as the above\n\u2014the date of the original letter.\n\"D , Ohio, July 17th, 1894.\n\"Dr. Hyslop,\u2014I have delayed answering your letter of April 2nd, hoping\nto send you the exact date of the letter in question. This I find I cannot\ndo\u2014but I know that it was either the 9th of January, or one week before\nthe 9th, which would be the 2nd, and it was not '93 but '94. Enclosed\nT 2\n\f274 Professor James H. Hyslop.\nyou will find a small picture of the lady which you need not return. I\nthink Mrs. D. will recognise the picture, although it was taken several\nyears ago.\"\nNew York, September 2oth, 1894.\nAfter receiving the above letter, I had to wait several weeks before I\ncould get an opportunity to see Mrs. D. and to try the experiment [of] the\nidentification of the picture and the person seen in her vision or dream. I\narranged with Mr. D. by note to call to-day, the distinct object of the visit\nbeing kept secret from Mrs. D. I took with me seven photographs, besides\nthe one I wanted identified. I selected them in a style that would prevent\nany striking contrasts with the one to be identified, which was a very plain\nand simple photograph, taken in the country, representing plain dress and\nnone of the flourishes of modern style. I therefore selected pictures taken\nfrom ten to eighteen years ago and representing plain faces, and simple\ndress, so that none would be rejected on the a priori ground that they were\ntoo stylish for the region from which the picture came and could not possibly\nrepresent such a person as Miss McE.\nI took them out of an envelope in which I had carried them and threw\nthem on the table without any arrangement, except to see that none of them\noverlapped, and then mentioned the object of my errand. Mrs. D., after\nrecalling the incident, at once remarked that she was dubious about the\nchance of recognising the lady, because in the vision the hair was brushed\nback on the forehead in such a peculiar way. But picking up a piece of\npaper at our suggestion she said she would try, and without a moment's\nhesitation or deliberation, placed it over the forehead of the right picture,\nsaying that she thought this was the one, but would cover the hair to see if\nBhe could be surer. She found that her judgment was confirmed, and she\nexpressed herself as more strongly convinced of her impressions. Her\nhusband suggested that she should try the experiment on another one in\nwhich the hair was brushed back from the forehead. But she refused,\nsaying promptly that this could not be the person, and no other picture\npresented a temptation to her except the right one. She remarked that the\nexpression of the eyes and face about the eyes was that of the person she\nsaw in the vision, and no other face showed this. She also went on to\nremark that the difficulty she knew she must meet in the case was the effect\nof the different position of the hair, and of the face which was seen from a\nquarter view in the vision, but with a full front in the picture. But in spite\nof this, her recognition was positive and unshaken, so far as comparison with\nthe other photographs was concerned.\nI may add that I did not believe, when I tried the experiment, that there\nwould be the slightest tendency to identification, much less the promptness\nand assurance felt that there were notable resemblances between the\npicture and the face in the vision, and that none were found in the other\npictures.\nIt is important to remember that Mrs. D. was not acquainted with and\nhad never seen the lady represented by the picture and seen in the dream.\nThey were absolute strangers to each other, the lady having made the\nacquaintance of Mrs. D.'s sister in the Sunday school, being a pupil of hers,\nI believe.\n\fSome Experiments in Crystal-Vision. 275\n(4)\nProfessor Hyslop's Report. ^ ^ 18g5\nMost of the details of this incident were told me before the issue of the\nevents was known, as will appear in the story and the first impression,\nconfirmed by Mr. D. I received Mrs. D. 's account on March 18th and the\nfinal knowledge of her brother's recovery, concerning whom her experience\nwas, was received on March 25th and April 2nd. But I can best give the\nincidents as they were told me in full and then give Mrs. D.'s memorandum\nof them written out afterward at my request.\nPrevious to the illness of her brother and before she had the slightest\nknowledge of the fact, one of those impressions came that she must write to\nhim and his wife to know if they were well. It was accompanied with a\nsort of palpitation of the heart which is an invariable sign with her that such\nimpressions have a probable meaning. The feeling was intense and she\ncould not banish her brother from her thoughts, though not accustomed to\ncommunicate with him frequently or to feel any such concern about him as\nshe then felt, apparently without reason. This was during the week\nprevious to February 23rd or 24th, when she received a card from her father,\ndated February 22nd, telling of the serious illness of her brother. Her\nfeelings continued after this, sometimes being very intense, and at times she\nfelt certain of his death or approaching death. On Saturday, March 16th, a\ntelegram was sent from D , Ohio, where Mrs. D.'s father lives, saying\n\" B. worse; we have but little hope; come if can.\" This indicated a\ncritical condition, but as it was too late to start that evening she resolved to\nwait until Monday morning. In the meantime at 10.20 p.m. that night,\nSaturday, while listening to Mr. D. reading a description of the disease\n(typhoid fever) and with a heavy heart, all at once, like the rolling away of\na dark cloud or the lifting of a dense fog, she felt the impression and\nassurance that her brother would live, and on the strength of it Mr. D.\ntelegraphed to her father that Mrs. D. would await further news before\ngoing. On Monday, March 18bh, Mrs. D. went to the dentist, and about\nnoon, while sitting in the dentist's chair and watching the funny traits and\nbehaviour of a strange lady in another chair, she felt a thud at her heart and\nheard a voice say \"B. is dead.\" But strange to say there was no feeling\nthat it was true. On the contrary, she felt it was not true and seemed\nassured, as she had been since Saturday, that he would get well. On March\n25th she received a letter from her father saying her brother was much better\nand that the doctor spoke very encouragingly of the case. Similar news came\non April 2nd. He has since recovered. These letters, cards and telegram I\nhave in my possession and have used them in compiling the above account,\nso that it is not merely a matter of memory in regard to dates and facts.\nMrs. D.'s abbreviated account of the facts is as follows : \"During the\nweek previous to receiving father's card of February 22nd, I had twice felt\nthe startled feeling of my heart and felt that I must write to B. and his\nwife. They were much in my mind. I lived over the days I spent with\nthem. The following is father's postal :\n' D , Ohio, February 22nd.\n'Dear E.,\u2014This is our forty-second anniversary and a rather sad one.\nMa has been quite sick, but is better and so she is about. B. is down\n\f276 Professor James H. Hyslop.\nwith typhoid fever. He commenced complaining some two weeks ago\nand has been under the doctor's care for a week. We feel very anxious\nabout him, but hope for the best.\u2014Your father, J.B.'\nThe next word from home was a telegram sent on Saturday, March 16th,\nand a postal card written March 15th and received March 18th, stating that\nbrother could hardly live. On Saturday evening I prayed that he would be\nspared and while listening to Mr. D. [reading] a description of the disease,\nlike the rolling away of a cloud or the lifting of a dense fog, I felt assured\nthat B. would live. On that night I saw Mother's face in agony, consider\nably drawn and showing great anxiety. On Monday morning at the dentist's\nabout 12 o'clock, while interested in a very peculiar character that sat in\nthe other dental chair and while laughing at some queer remarks she was\nmaking, there came a thump of my heart so strong that I felt as if I had\nbeen hit and the words ' B. is dead.' In the afternoon Dr. Hyslop came\nand left a crystal glass for crystal gazing.\"\nThen follows a remark or two regarding the effect of experiments with\nthe crystal, among them being one apparition of her brother's face with a\nshort stubby beard upon it, just such as would grow during sickness, though\nno mention of the fact had been made in the correspondence, and the idea\nhad not occurred to her in thinking of her brother's illness.\n\fA Case of Psychic Automatism. 277\nIV.\nA CASE OP PSYCHIC AUTOMATISM, INCLUDING\n\"SPEAKING WITH TONGUES.\"\nBy Albert Le Baron.1\nCommunicated by Professor William James.\n[In the early seventies I was invited to see a young woman from\nthe country, who had come up to Boston in the hope of finding some\nlearned men in that city who might be able to determine the unknown\nlanguage which her lips were irresistibly impelled to utter. I cannot\nnow recall her account of the way in which this phenomenon in her\nhad originated, but it was a curious thing to hear. \u25a0 When she gave\nherself permission, her vocal organs would articulate nonsense-syllables\nwith the greatest volubility and animation of expression and with no\napparent fatigue, and then again stop at the behest of her will. The\nyoung woman and the friends with whom she stayed seemed sincere\nin their belief that this must be a religious miracle identical with the\n\" speaking with tongues \" so common among the earliest Christians,\nand which St. Paul seems himself to have possessed, judging from\nI. Corinthians, Chap. XIV. It is hardly needful to say that at\nthe time when I saw her, this young woman's speech had not been\nrecognised by any linguistic expert in Boston or Cambridge, and that\n(she herself knowing no foreign tongue) all its phonetic elements were\npalpably English.\nI never heard of the later history of her case, and have never since\nmet with this phenomenon of automatism until I became acquainted\nlast year with Mr. Le Baron, as I will call the gentleman whose\nnarrative follows. I had, a couple of years previously, corresponded\nwith him about a small and abstruse work on metaphysics which he\nhad published ; a year later, the lady whom he calls Evangel in\nhis narrative wrote to me that he had become the subject of remark\nable personal powers which I ought to witness f and correspondence\n1 Author's Rights reserved.\n2 T^8 k the letter =~ \" November 26th, 1894.\n\" My Dear Pbofessob James,\u2014Among those who came to [us] this summer was\nMr. [Le Baron.] He was so much impressed with what he thought the ideal state of\nthings which he found that he returned again and again for a day at a time to get an\n\f278 Albert Le Baron.\nfinally brought about a meeting with him and an exhibition of his\nvocal automatism, of which, at his request, Dr. Hodgson and I\npresently had phonograms taken, which are now at the Society's office\nin Boston.\nMr. Le Baron, who is a literary man, aged 39, was at that time\n(February, 1895) much impressed by his various experiences, and by\nno means willing to abandon the idea that his unintelligible vocal\nperformances were involuntary reproductions of some ancient or remote\ntongue. His earnestness and energy in seeking to gain corroboration\nfor this view is the best possible proof that the vocal movements\ncarried with them for him, as he made them, no subjective feeling of\nbeing due to his personal will. This, too, in spite of the fact that his\nwill could both start and arrest them, make them go fast or slow, and\nsing instead of speaking them. The phonetic elements in his case again\nseemed English ; and I tried to make him believe (but all in vain) that\nthe whole thing was a decidedly rudimentary form of motor automa\ntism analogous to the scrawls and scribbles of an \" undeveloped \"\nautomatically-writing hand. He spent hours poring over grammars\nand vocabularies of African and Asiatic tongues. First it was Coptic,\nthen Rommany, then something Dravidian. I corresponded with\nuplift, as he said. On one of these occasions while calling at our house (he was in a\nroom which was always my mother's afternoon room), he had a strange psychical\nexperience. He began talking in a way that he could not control. Later he spoke to\nme in a voice so like my mother's that her St. Bernard dog, which hitherto had not\nnoticed him, got up and went over to him and smelt his face in seeming recognition.\nAs he seemed unable to help himself, I became alarmed and called help. Since then\nhe has had many strange experiences, speaking in various tongues and writing down\nthe sounds phonetically and then writing translations. One of them ' Hymn to\nEgypt,' I mail herewith. He is conscious of all he does now, and can permit the\nutterance or not at will. He is very desirous of confirming the tongues if possible.\n. . . Some one versed in Oriental languages could quickly tell whether what\ncomes to him is of value.\u2014Respectfully yours,\n\"(Signed) .\"\nA later letter from the same lady reads as follows :\u2014\n\"April 26th, 1895.\n\"Mr Dear Professor James,\u2014 . . . Mr. [Le Baron] came to [our camp]\nlast summer, to write-up for the a short account of [our] work. He had\nbeen a great lover of the Kantian philosophy, but he had lapsed into agnosticism,\nand almost pessimism. The work at [Shelter Island] interested him so much that he\nremained over night. During the night he had a vision concerning it which seemed\nto him so far from realisation that he spent the night in tears, and went away feeling\nthat our work was an ideal one, but that there was no place for it in this busy,\nbustling nineteenth century. Nevertheless, it lured him back again, and one evening\nwhile sitting in our reception room at our own house, and talking with me concerning\nthe work and my mother's life, he had a very startling experience. He was suddenly\npsychologised in some way, and, though conscious, began saying words which he felt\ndid not originate in his own mind. His whole manner of speaking and his tones\nchanged so much that the large St. Bernard dog, which had been a special pet of my\nmother, rose up from the rug and went over to him and began lapping his hands all\n\fA Case of Psychic Automatism. 279\nvarious philologists in his behalf, sending them specimens, phoneti\ncally written out, of his discourse. But no light came, and finally he\ngrew convinced, by the mere progress of the phenomenon, that it was\nless important than it pretended to be.\nAt last, yielding to urgent importunity on my part (for the case\nseemed to me too rare and too valuable from the intellectual character\nof the subject to be lost), Mr. Le Baron has written out the autobio\ngraphic narrative which follows of his experience. The names are\nchanged to prevent identification, and the actual geographical scope\nof country disguised; but the facts related I believe to be substantially\ntrue, and the relative distances of the journeys taken are correct. Of\nthe sincerity of the writer I have myself no doubt.\nWilliam James.]\nAlbert Le Baron's Experience.\nIn the summer of 1894 I had occasion, for the sake of a certain\nliterary project, to visit a portion of our coast. At a place to which I\nwill give the name of Shelter Island I found a group of mystics\nsummering. I drifted into the esoteric camp with a copy of Kant's\nover. The tone in which Mr. [Le Baron] spoke was very like my mother's, and the\nwords said purported to be inspired by her. When I saw how much he was affected,\nI became alarmed and called assistance. After a time he resumed his normal\ncondition, and said that he had been conscious through it all, knew that he was\ntalking, but could not help himself. This, as I understand, was the beginning of\nmany strange experiences which came to him later, at home surrounded by his\nfamily, and also when away from home on journeys.\n\" Of the strange tongues with which he speaks I can say but little. I have no\nknowledge of them, and the translations that purport to be given are largely of an\nethical nature. He has kept a very accurate account of these communications, but I\nhave not yet had the leisure and opportunity to examine them.\n\" This speaking in strange tongues is not a new thing to me. Once in this city\nI heard an old man, a Catholic, speak in a tongue which was very musical, and\npurported to be an old form of the Latin language. He was entirely an uneducated\nman, and later on what he said was translated by Mrs. Cora L. V. Richmond, of whom\nyou have probably heard. What was given purported to be from a priest of the\nRomish Church who was a missionary to California several hundred years ago, and\nin this communication he claimed that what he said could all be verified by documents\nnow in the Vatican at Rome. These communications were taken down by Mrs.\nRichmond's husband in shorthand, and if you desire, I have no doubt you can verify\nwhat I have said.\n\"Concerning Mr. [Le Baron] there is little more to be said except this: that\nthe experiences which have come to him have altered his whole course of thinking.\nWhere he was formerly despondent, he is now optimistic, and at peace with himself.\nThis in itself is a great joy to his family and to me. If I could see you, I could tell\nyou much more which at present it is impossible for me to write.\n\" I feel that Mr. [Le Barou] has a work before him for which these experiences\nare in some degree, perhaps, preparing him. Of this I feel sure : that he is earnest,\nsincere, and absolutely to be relied upon.\u2014Very truly yours,\n\f280 Albert Le Baron.\n\" Critique \" in my valise, by way of a little light summer reading.\nThe leader of the Shelter Island mystics, Evangel, was a spiritist\nof the loftiest type, a believer in re-incarnation, whose psycho-\nautomatic \" control \" was her dead mother. Of practical genuine\nspiritualism I knew nothing. To theosophy I was an utter stranger.\nI found the atmosphere of the camp pregnant with a new type\nof the old style of millenial optimism. The World's Congress of\nReligions had re-awakened the hope of a new chemistry of civilisation.\nThe pious heart of Evangel was solacing itself with the holy hope\nof doing something to effect a union of the occidental and oriental\nreligions on the purest conceivable basis of Gnostic-Platonism.\nOccasionally, seances were secretly held, far into the midnight, for\nthe purpose of procuring information from \" invisible brethren \" to\ncarry on the work. At one of these seances I met with my first\nexperience. We were seated under a pine tree. Clairvoyants were\npresent. \" Wheels \" of light and other phenomena were said to be\nseen by them. I sat listening to the affirmations.\nSuddenly an entirely new and strange psycho-automatic force shook\nthrough me like a gust of fierce wind through a tree. I willed myself\ninto a state of passivity in order to observe the phenomena. I went\ninto no trance however. The force became intelligent in action. It\ndrew back my neck. Additional motor violence was displayed in my\nlimbs. I was brought, from my sitting posture, down on the flat of\nmy back. The force produced a motor disturbance of my head and\njaws. My mouth made automatic movements ; till, in a few seconds,\nI was distinctly conscious of another's voice\u2014unearthly, awful, loud,\nand weird\u2014bursting through the woodland from my own lips, with\nthe despairing words : \" Oh ! My People ! \" Mutterings of semi-\npurposive prophecy followed. One of the clairvoyants added additional\nweirdness to the experience by positively affirming that phantasms of\nancient Egyptian sages stood over me.\nI was so dazed and \" rattled \" by the experience and the motor\ndisturbances, that, at the close of the seance, I had to be assisted to my\nfeet, and was walked for some time to and fro in the night air to\nrecover my equilibrium.\nThe witnesses of the foregoing experience are alive at this hour.\nThe names can be secured\u2014if desired\u2014by any one. Either Professor\nJames or Dr. Hodgson could secure them and furnish them, for the\nnames of some of them are already known to the S.P.R. officers.\nDuring my short stay in the camp I enjoyed the hospitality of\nEvangel. Later, I was reclining on the sofa her mother had lain\non during her last sickness. Again, the psycho-automatism struggled\nto manifest itself. I shaded my eyes with my hand to shut off dis\ntracting objects, and to assist my thought to a dead stand-still. This\n\fA Case of Psychic Automatism. 281\ntime, a woman's voice came through my lips. Evangel positively\nclaimed that it was the voice of her dead mother.\nOn hearing the voice of the woman escape my lips, her dead\nmother's old dog \" Barry \" staggered painfully across the room to where\nI was lying, and began smelling my face.\n\" He smells her ! \" whispered Evangel. The old dog lay down\nby my side. In a few minutes the voice of the psycho-automatism\nchanged. A man's deep voice succeeded that of the dead woman's.\n\" It's father ! \" again whispered Evangel.\nStatements of a semi-prophetic character were again indulged in by\nthe psycho-automatism, and the words : \" he shall be a leader of the\nhosts of the Lord ! \" exploded with loud emphasis. The seance came\nto a close. The effect of all this new experience on my emotional\nnature was powerful. I trod in holy awe about the rooms of the house\nof Evangel, as, ever and anon, vibrations of the psycho-automatism\nwith which I was en rapport trembled through my nerves, evoking\nstrange and holy modes of the most exquisite consciousness.\nThose feelings were the most wonderful I have ever enjoyed.\nOne night I slept in the bed where the dead father of Evangel\nslept during the last years of his life. The next morning I awoke\nlame. I limped about painfully for hours. The father of Evangel\nwas a lame man.1 As a sensitive somnambule I had taken on his lame\ncondition. On the general principle that all startling and unusual\nphenomena are interpreted as having some personal bearing, particu\nlarly when we are distinctly informed that they have, I construed the\nvibrations of the psycho-automatism, whenever they occurred, as\nevidence of the presence of the \" spirit \" of Evangel's mother.\n\" Has mother been here 1 \" asked Evangel on one occasion, dis\ncovering me in a flood of tears. I answered her in an affirmative sob,\nand a tone of pious awe ; for my assent to the spiritistic interpreta\ntion of the phenomena had induced a permanent and deep exaltation\nof religious sentiment. I would lie in bed on my back, peering\nwistfully into the night darkness at the shadowy and vapoury outlines\nof what I supposed to be \"invisible brethren.\" I could hear distinct\nraps on the head-board. Small globules of golden light would, after\ntravelling about the room in the blackness, come and melt away over\nmy eyes. In the dense darkness, a group of arithmetical figures once\nshone from near the ceiling of the room.\nEvangel was the possessor of a finger ring, considered to possess\noccult powers. She had been told by a clairvoyant that she was to\nreceive this talisman, some months previous to her reception of it. The\n1 In answer to enquiries, Mr. Le Baron writes: \"I did not know beforehand\nthat her father was lame. I was informed so when seen limping.\"\u2014Ed.\n\f282 Albert Le Baron.\ngem came in a roundabout way from Egypt, having been purchased\nfrom an Arab by a certain American gentleman whilst on a trip to\nthe Orient.\nThe mysterious advent of this ring, and the profound belief of\nEvangel in the genuineness of the communications from the spirit of her\nsaintly mother, were the two\u2014as she considered them\u2014impregnable\nfacts, by the means of which she substantiated the accuracy of her\ncall to her work. As proof of the occult spiritual power of the ring,\nEvangel told of a young man, a sceptic, who, on placing the ring on\nhis finger, was thrown down on the floor of a room in a convulsive\ncondition.\nI heard the story and asked for the ring to be placed on my finger.\nAn attempt at spontaneous chirography was suggested. My hand\nflew in wide jerky spasmodic movements over the table. Nothing\nintelligible came. I laughed in incredulity. Evangel gently rebuked\nme : \" You must not laugh at them.\" \"They are glad to meet you ! \"\nejaculated another lady in the room, explaining the violence of the\nmotor disturbances.\nBut the ice was broken. It was only a question of development. It\nwas also explained that I was difficult to control, and that it would take\na little time for \" them \" to be able to write through me. Subsequently\nthe psycho-physical spontaneity controlled the right arm and hand,\nand wrote intelligible verbiage. Prom subsequent experiences, I\nbelieve the automatism capable of modifying the ordinary presentations\nof at least four out of the five senses. As the interpretation of life\nby me now was solely from the angle of mystical cognition, rather\nthan from the theorems of pure reason, I became a most devoutly\nearnest religionist. My love of the sublime was nurtured by the dream\nof Evangel as to the possibility of the union of the occidental and\noriental religious worlds, and my converse with the \" spirits \" of the\ndead upon that vast subject. I secretly avoided the living to talk with\nthe \" spirits \" in the depths of the pine woods, or on the hill-tops,\nwith my head bared to the heavens. Following out the same principle,\nI took delight in roaming through private burying grounds. I invari\nable \" sensed \" the presence of the spontaneity in grave-yards ; and\nthis \" sensing \" of the psycho-spontaneity was always interpreted by\nme to be an indication of the presence of the \" invisible brotherhood.\"\nI became ascetic, and avoided animal food. I quoted the oracles of\nZoroaster, and laid aside Kant's \" Critique.\" I became exquisitely\nmorbid on the subject of my own spiritual and moral unworthiness,\nand could not reconcile humility with the splendid confidence of\nEvangel.\nThe first message of importance given to me on leaving Shelter\nIsland was at Riverhead, September 6th and 8th, 1894. The first\n\fA Case of Psychic Automatism. 283\nmessage was to be sent to Evangel as purporting to be an address\nto her from her mother. In the second address, the psycho-spontaneity\nor automatism, assuming to be the \" true mother \" of my \" soul,\" said,\namong other things : \" I am going to guide you into the way of truth.\nYou must be at the door of the church near the old house\nin the town of Stowe, which is in the state Vermont, by the time the\nsun rises on next Tuesday. You will then see the reason why I told\nyou to go.\" On September 9th, at my residence, having returned to\nNew York City, I asked for more explicit instructions. Among other\nthings, the psycho-automatism, still assuming to be the dead mother\nof Evangel, said : \" I think you are now to be the one that shall\nhear the voice of the One .that shall be the truth. . . . You will\nknow that it is He by the voice of the Holy One.\" As (in my opinion,\nthough perhaps obscurely stated) the reverence accompanying the deific\nrhetoric of civilisations varies in the ratio that the special education of\na people leads them to insert their own concrete value into any given\nmethod of rhetoric, I did not deem it unlikely that the psycho-\nautomatism would assume that deific rhetorical style likely to be the\nmost revered by me. I did not know that such a village as Stowe\nexisted. But Evangel did, as I subsequently learned. A map\nshowed the village located some distance from Bolton. On Sunday\nnight I left New York for Bolton, Vermont. I hired a carriage at the\nhotel at Bolton, and drove to Stowe. At Stowe I ordered the carriage\nready by sunrise. The next morning about 5 o'clock I was in the porch\nof the church. The building was old, weather-beaten, and the flooring\nof the porch in a decayed condition. The porch faced the east, and the\nedifice was on a hill overlooking the village. An old house stood near\nit. I uncovered my head and stood in the porch and faced the east.\nThe night had been a drizzling one. The sky was black with the\nremnants of the rain clouds. Slowly golden streaks of dawn appeared.\nThe black clouds rolled away. The sun arose. I noticed a grave-yard\nacross a field. The psycho-automatism indicated an ejection of verbiage.\nThe verbiage assumed a deific style, and was as follows :\u2014\nI shall be glorified in the work of the people, for thou hast proved\nthyself to be the man whose voice is the voice of Him who sent thee.\nThou has obeyed the command of the Holy One, and the valleys shall\nrejoice in the hope and the joy of the Lord. I shall be in thy heart, and\nthou shalt answer to my voice.\nSuch a style of verbiage proved to me that the cause of the psycho-\nautomatism knew that my emotional nature would be influenced by it\nwhen I recognised its deific modes of composition. I have no adequate\nidea of any deific object answering to such a communicating style, but\nsimply state the facts, irrespective of the deific, or any other mere\nrhetorical form.\n\f284 Albert Le Baron.\nOn returning to Bolton I concluded to remain there till I had\nfinished a certain small piece of literary work. On Wednesday night,\nSeptember 12th, I retired to my room at the inn somewhat early, to be\nalone with the \" invisible brotherhood \";\u2014perchance they had something\nto communicate. Again the psycho-automatism assumed the grave\ndeific style known to the occidental English-speaking world. Viva\nvoce it gave utterance to the following chain of historic conceptions :\u2014\nI will tell thee of the days of thy sojourning in the land of the people\nof the Jumba, where the land is the joy and the light is the joy of the\npeople. The land is the country of the ancient Egyptians, and thy glory\nand thy power was the pride of the people. Thy name was Rameses, and\nthy glory was the end of the triumph of the people. Thou didst throw\ndown the people, for their joy was the truth of the truth. Thou didst\nexalt thyself to the end, and the hope of the truth was in thy keeping, and\nthy victory was the fall of the truth. Thy way was not the way of the\nLord, and the Lord hath sent thee through the fire.\nThe point I subsequently made on the foregoing speech, was, that\ngranting the composition to be a chain of lies from beginning to end,\nit certainly takes some degree of intelligence to be able to lie so\nartistically, and that the cause of the psycho-automatism must have\nknown something of the truth about the matter, to be able to lie\nabout it.\nI deem it a vital necessity for future psychical illustration to give\na somewhat full and adequate illustration of the various rhetorical\nforms of the deific verbiage employed by my psycho-automatism.\nHeretofore, experimental inductions of such psycho-automatic pro\ncesses have not scientifically reached the analytical stage of the\nmystico-deific-modes.\nA somewhat poetic form of the deific style given to me viva voce in\na hotel of Woodstock, Vermont, is a case in point. There are some\neighty-nine words in the passage.\nWhen the song of the day is the song of the night, and the truth is the\njoy, and the triumph of the peace is the song of the redeemed, then the\nhope of all flesh shall be the truth, and the deliverance from the truth\nwhich now is the truth of the day but the darkness of the light ! The\nflash of the truth is the truth of the day, and the flash of the fire of the\ntruth shall soon be the light of the night.\nThat a high excitement of the mind inspiring confidence and hope\nof success is an essential to the induction of such phenomena goes\nwithout saying. On any lower plane than ecstasy or transport of soul\nI was in a constantly distressed condition.\nFrom this arose the temptation to yield\u2014at odd moments\u2014a\nfacility of credulous assent to the re-incarnating and other assertions of\nthe psycho-automatism. If, however, I accepted the mystic conceptions\n\fA Case of Psychic Automatism. 285\nas bond fide, then I was thrown into violent antagonism to my own\ncommon sense, and that of the world. On the other hand, if I withdrew\nmy assent to the holier utterances of the psycho-automatism, then my\n\" spiritual \" nature and love of the sublime violently rebelled. Thus I\nvibrated like a pendulum between the new world of psychic phenomena\non the one hand, and the old world of physical phenomena on the\nother. To my cognition of the foregoing alternative was presented the\nfollowing perplexing dilemma. If both of these worlds of experience\nsimply implied relations of my consciousness to two totally distinct\nworlds of phenomena, and my consciousness was in any way related\nto the deific \" thing-in-itself \" ; then, from what unknown source\nemanated these two distinct worlds of phenomena to which the laws\nof this deific consciousness related ? This crux criticorum still\nremains the puzzle of my life.\nBut other startling experiences were before me.\nOn Monday morning, September 17th, came another message viva\nvoce to go to St. Louis. To a house on the street \" which is called the\nstreet of the the number is one, two, three.\"\nThis I construed to mean 123, Street. The object of my\ngoing was explained. I would meet some one there who would give\nme information. In this message given in my home in the suburbs of\nNew York City to go to St. Louis, a tendency to the antithetical deific\nstyle appeared more fully. The principle by which conceptions were\npurposely set in opposition to each other, revealed itself in the following\nseventy-five words :\u2014\nI have seen thee in glory, and I have seen thee in shame !\nI have seen thee in light, and I have seen thee in darkness !\nI have seen thee in peace, and I have seen thee in terror !\nI have seen thee in joy, and I have seen thee in sorrow !\nI have seen thee exalted, and I have seen thee debased !\nTuesday, September 18th, I secured railway transportation, New\nYork to St. Louis, return ; and whilst on the train, conversed by\nmeans of a pencil and pad with the psycho-automatism. The perpetual\nquestion with me was : Can I via psycho-automatism, ascend into the\nuncreated essence of thought\u2014to the Mind of Minds\u2014and perchance\nsnatch down some new metaphysical conception helpful to the lower\nworld ? Utter self-surrender and self-abandonment were insisted on\nby the psycho-automatism. 123, Street, I found to be a\nbusiness block. The number had been given, as I thought, simply as a\ntest. Other tests were given the next day. I began to rebel. In the\ndirectory I found the name of an artist whom I knew. I explained\nmyself. Prom my artist friend I learned that the most occult man in\nthe west lived on Chonteau Avenue, and that he considered his life\ncontrolled by a princely priest of the house of Rameses the great ! I\n\f286 Albert Le Baron.\ncalled on the gentleman and saw a picture of this Egyptian prince-\npriest on the wall of his room. The occultist was ascetic in appearance,\npale, with large dreamy eyes. I explained my mission ; and later,\nwhilst in an apparently semi-trance condition, he made a lengthy\nforeign speech which purported to come from the princely priest of the\nhouse of the Egyptian King. A stenographer who was present took\ndown the subsequent translation. Both the gentleman and his\nstenographer knew Evangel.\nThe following sentences may shew the trend of the verbiage and\nthe conceptions :\u2014\nOh ! Son of Ram ! For the first time have I the privilege of speaking\nto you face to face since I last held your hands chilling with physical death\non the banks of the Nile. ... I congratulate you that you have laid\naside the tempestuous feeling of arrogance which, in the ancient days,\ncontrolled you for your overpowering \u2014 which have brought to you in\nthe times past much of discipline, much of sorrow, much of anguish, before\nyou had entered the present body. . . . Having fulfilled obligations to\nthe utmost, having reached the point to which you were sent and directed\nthrough the devious ways which you have travelled to reach and attain.\nWe know you well enough to understand that the life which comes will be\ndevoted to such degree as possible, under the circumstances of the environ\nment, to the new thought\u2014the understanding and comprehension of the\nreal, and to the awakening to that which you become to see is the unreality.\nOut of the darkness shall come the Light, the Light that is the joy and the\nhope of the nations ! Etc.\nThe speech of this gentleman simply added fuel to my psychic fire,\nand I have every reason to believe that the gentleman believed that he\nwas uttering a genuine foreign tongue.\nWas this psycho-automatism \" fooling \" this man, as well as myself?\nIf not, what as yet undiscovered law governed the phenomena 1 That\nthis psycho-automatism could reach a style of deific assumption even\nmajestic in its utterance, is further illustrated by the following\ncomposition, which came through my hand automatically, far into the\ndead of night, as I lay in a passion of self-abasement on my bed in\nthe hotel.\nThe love of the past hath been darkness, the love of the future shall be\nlight ! The power of all flesh is love, and the light of all flesh is love !\nMy love shall cover the great mountains ! My love shall rule the seas\nas with a rod of power ! My love shall be the strength of the Day,\nand my love shall be the curtain of the Darkness ! My love shall inhabit\nthe earth, and my love shall save all flesh ! My love shall be thy father\nand thy mother, and my love shall be thy love ! My love is the sun in its\nstrength, and the flowers breathe my love ! The stars rejoice in my love,\nand my love shall fill all things with my glory ! I love the man whose heart\nis broken, and I love the woman whose sorrow is the cup of her peace !\nI love the man who is poor, and the man who is filled with the joys\n\fA Case of Psychic Automatism. 287\nof life ! I love the man who shall not love me, and I love the man\nwho loves me ! I love the darkness, for the darkness shall be light !\nI love the terror, for I love the peace ! I love the beauty of man, and I\nlove the sadness of man ! I love the unrest of man, and I love the\npeace of man ! I love the peace, and I love the sorrow ! I love the joy,\nand I love the terror ! I love the praise, and I love the curse ! I love the\nman whose ways are dark, and I love the man whose ways are light !\nI love the love of hope, and I love the love of love ! I love the day of\nmourning, and I love the day of joy ! I love the love of pleasure, and I\nlove the love of pain ! I love the man who steals, and I love him from\nwhom he hath stolen ! I love the man who kills, and I love the man\nwho is slain ! I love the world, for the world is mine, and the truth of all\nthings is love !\nTo substantiate the fact that the psycho-automatism can give\u2014\nviva voce as well as by automatic chirography\u2014expression to concep\ntions embodying the same antithetic principle of reiterative deific\npersonification, I append the following seventy-five words :\u2014\nI have heard the roar of cities ! I have heard the music of the\nwoodlands ! I have heard the tears of the nations as they fell ! I have\nheard the songs of the nations as they rose ! I have heard the roar of the\ndeath of the man who was slain in battle ! I have heard the shout of\nthe victor ! I have heard the new word, and I have heard the old word !\nIt is for the reader to decide whether or no the above phrases can\nbe construed as being in any way explanatory of the transcendental\nbasis of the world as a sum of phenomena. They are beyond my\ncomprehension. Whether or no they proceed telepathically from the\nliving or dead ; or whether they proceed from some transcendental\nsubject, which is a sort of deific representation of that which con\ntains the grounds of cosmical phenomena according to unknown and\ntranscendental laws, I cannot make deposition to. I do not know.\nWhilst on my return trip to New York City, my first experience in\nclairaudience was given. I was sleeping, and suddenly awakened by\na voice shouting in my ear the words : \" The enthusiasm shall fill\nthe hearts of the multitude in the place of the hours of the day ! \"\nIn subsequent dreams came such sentences as : \" It shall take two\nbirds to carry thee, my son.\" \" Blessed are they who always obey\nthemselves.\" The latter sentence I saw in my dream, in English\ncharacters, among a number of ideographs on an Egyptian slab of\nstone.\nFrom the foregoing it is evident that, in its incipiency, the pheno\nmenon differed from that of a de'doublement de la personnalitS, in that\nit did not appear to be a case of \" subliminal consciousness \" on the\none hand, or a supra-normal intellectual faculty on the other, but\ndistinctly that of a purely extraneous psycho-physical spontaneity or\nV\n\f288 Albert Le Baron.\nautomatism. It was psychic, for it presented conceptions ; it was\nphysical, for it presented sense intuitions ; it was spontaneous and\nautomatic, for it acted independently of the usual trend of motor\nphenomena on the one hand, and of the wilful intelligence as used\nin ordinary experience on the other. This it automatically continued\nto do until later on in my experience, when I believed myself to be\nso completely en rapport with it that I considered the spontaneity\npractically identical with and in perfect accord with the actions of\nmy own will. From this point on, there was a gradual diminution\nin the character of the manifestations.\nJust so long as I assented to its absolute objectivity, my emotions\nand feelings were all dramatically influenced to joy or grief by the\nappearance of its conceptions. It was unquestionably true that if\ninterests could be predicated of the cause of the psycho-automatism,\nthose interests were always in an inverse ratio to physical pleasure on\na low plane. How my suffering could be in any sense an advantage\nto the cause of this psycho-automatism, save as a means of getting me\ninto a more sensitive condition, I do not know. And yet my experi\nence repeatedly taught me that a complete self-surrender to the psycho-\nautomatism, as a deific telepathic ideal, resulted in the communication\nof a loftier flow of verbiage. And, as a distinct mode of consciousness,\nthe psycho-mystic mode now ranked, in my own experience, as the\ncausa sine qua non of a definite form of religion.\nThe automatism repeatedly urged me to take long journeys, which,\njudging from my past experience in obeying it, I have no doubt would\nhave resulted in gifts of deific verbiage, and other phenomena, if I had\nobeyed. It told me to be in on the 30th of December, 1894, and\nI should receive a reward, but I did not go. It told me to go and see\nthe Emperor of China, but I did not go. It told me to go to Seville,\nSpain, but I did not go. The only reason I could account for its\nperpetual desire for me to take such journeys was that it seemed to\nknow that my nervous system transmitted better when I was in a\n\" worked-up \" condition when coming and going. Expectation or\ndisappointment threw me into the more sensitive condition essential to\nits manifestation.\nSpeaking in Unknown Tongues.\nIt is hardly necessary to observe that a deific style of verbiage is\nnecessarily relative, and that\u2014as mere sound\u2014the neighing of a pony\nis more musical to my ear than for a man to utter deific conceptions to\nme in a language I know nothing about. On Sunday morning,\nSeptember 30th, 1894, I had my first experience in \" speaking in\nunknown tongues,\" at my residence in the suburbs of New York City.\nI had been conversing with the psycho-automatism the night previous,\n\fA Case of Psychic Automatism. 289\nand up to that time had received sufficient deific verbiage, one way and\nthe other, to make a small book. Suddenly, whilst conversing with it\nin my bedroom on Sunday morning, it changed abruptly off from\nEnglish into unintelligible sounds resembling a foreign tongue, and\nwhich, had I not been, as I think, pretty level-headed at the time, I\nshould have construed as a mental state pathognomic of mania. And\nyet I was not sufficiently \"at myself \" to immediately seize pencil and\npad and write down the sounds. When I subsequently asked of the\npsycho-automatism for a translation, among others I received the two\nfollowing :\u2014\nThe Darkness to Egypt.\nI have seen all thy ways, O son of the Nile ! I have heard all thy songs,\n0 son of the Nile ! I have listened to all thy woes, O son of the Nile ! I\nhave been with thee, O son of the Nile ! I have been near thee when thy\ndays were full of glory. I have been near thee when thy days were covered\nin sadness. I have heard thy voice, O son of Egypt ! I have counted thy\ntears, O son of Egypt ! I have heard thy voice of wailing, O son of Egypt !\n1 have watched thee when thy men of might have flown ; I have watched\nthee when thy glory has faded ; I have watched thee when thy sun has set ;\nI have watched thee, O son of the Nile ! Thy tears have been my tears ; thy\njoys have been my joys ; thy woes have been my woes. O son of the Nile,\nI love thee ! O son of the Nile, I love thee ! My heart yearns for the days\nof thy glory. My heart opens to thy heart. O son of the Nile, how I love\nthee ! Thy sands are now the way of the stranger ; thy plains are now the\npath of the poor ; thy fields are now the wastes of the day. Thy hope is\ngone ; thy day has fled ; thy years are gone. O son of Egypt, I have loved,\nloved, loved, loved thee ! Thy day shall rise again. Thy hope shall dawn,\nthy sun shall shine, thy love shall be mine, thy tears shall flow, thy hope\nshall dawn, thy flowers shall bloom again. Thy palaces shall rise again, thy\ndream shall live again. Thy years shall be years of joy, thy triumph shall be\nthe triumph of peace, thy walks shall ring with new songs, thy hopes shall\ndawn with new stars, thy rivers shall flow with new life ; thy heavens shall\nblaze with new light. Thy hope is my hope, thy coming is my coming. I\nam he who loved thee ; I am he who kissed thy lips ; I am he who in thy\ngreat hour was thine. I love thee, I love thee, I love thee ; O son of Egypt,\nI love thee ! When thy day shall rise again, I will be thy guide ; when thy\nhour shall dawn again, I will be thy love ; when thy morn shall rise again, I\nwill be thy sun ; when thy life shall flow, I will be thy heart ; when thy love\nshall beat, I will be thy breast ; when thy womb shall bear thy young, I will\nbe thy guide ; when thy life shall ebb again, I will be thy life ; when thy\nstar shall go to rest, I will be thy night ; when thy love shall be thy day, I\nwill be thy love. O son of Egypt, I have loved thee ! Thy way has been\nlong ; thy path has been dark ; thy woes have been many ; thy tears have\nbeen as the sand. I love thee ! I love thee ! I love thee !\nThe other translation embodied, among other things, the following\nrelatively intelligible sentences, which, as I wrote them down, according\nv 2\n\f290 Albert Le Baron.\nto the sounds, are as enigmatical to me as the purported foreign\ntongue from which they assumed to be a translation :\u2014\nSon of Peru\u2014of Gerro\u2014of Terro\u2014of Tichaperu\u2014Terra\u2014Terra\u2014of\nPesuro\u2014of Tepecutu\u2014of Teruto\u2014Zeereelu\u2014Instopan\u2014of Zeecorila\u2014\nSceucru. Greeting : I have come through these of mine\u2014I have come\u2014I\nhave come ! Eros, Eros, Eros.\nThe intelligibility of the first translation, at least, the a priori\ncognitive content of the translated sentences assured me that the\nunintelligible sounds were not necessarily pathognomic of mania, but\nlike the repeated requests to take journeys, were another stratagem to\nkeep me in a \" worked-up \" condition of expectation or disappointment\nessential to its manifestations. If, caeteris paribus, such was its\nobject, it succeeded admirably, and here, again, arose the temptation\nto yield a facility of credulous assent to the opinion that I was\nspeaking a language known to me previously, on the hypothesis of the\npre-existence of the soul. This for a time I believed. In my\nattempt to demonstrate this I exerted an immense amount of philo\nlogical energy, as Professor William James and Dr. Hodgson can\ntestify. On Monday, October 1st, 1894, I left my home in the\nsuburbs of New York City for the town of Levanna, N.Y. In room\n12 of the hotel and on Monday night, came the following messages\nin \" unknown tongues \" together with the interpretations :\u2014\nThe Unknown Tongue.\u2014Te rumete tau.

The Love\nis produced by the great light of all things ! All the Light must come from\nthe Great Light !\nIn the attempt subsequently to explain the foregoing \" foreign\ntongues \" I arranged nine different theories from which the reader\nmay take his choice.\nFirst Theory.\u2014The sentences are all the work of a powerful\nunconscious imagination and the sentences do not possess the natural\nconsonantal and vowel elements of a language at all.\nSecond Theory.\u2014They are brand new ideas in old and foreign\nverbal husks, the forms of which were latent in the man's sub\nconsciousness at birth.\nThird Theory.\u2014The consonantal and vowel combinations are but\nthe articulate shells of very ancient ideas latent in this man's sub\nconsciousness at birth, but out of the shells of which the meanings\nhave been eaten up or metamorphosed by some at present unknown\nlaw of mental evolution, but are not now to be considered as ideas\nat all.\nFourth Theory.\u2014They are none of the foregoing, but are new and\nactual presentations of real and new ideas in a foreign tongue.\n\fA Case of Psychic Automatism. 293\nFifth Theory.\u2014They are none of the foregoing, but a ludicrous and\nsilly mistake of the man's imagination allied to some species of\nhumorous hallucination and are not to be considered seriously, or they\nare a perjury, or a ghastly jest, or a very profound mental trick, or the\nloose jargon of a maniac.\nSixth Theory.\u2014They are none of the foregoing, but are a species of\nscientific telepathy, and the consonantal and vowel combinations come\nfrom some morally indifferent, sublimely good, or awfully naughty\nsource, and which is subject to the will of the man.\nSeventh Theory.\u2014Notwithstanding he says he never knew or heard\nthese consonantal and vowel combinations before he uttered them, he\nmay be in some very mysterious way deceiving himself.\nEighth Theory.\u2014That it may not be beyond human belief that he\nis unconsciously in possession of a similar principle of intuitive\nlinguistic power said to be possessed at this day by the higher adepts\nof India, or the Grand Lama of Thibet, or the Rosicrucians, by the\nmeans of which an unknown language is spoken by purely intuitive\nprocesses unknown to the analysis of western mental philosophy.\nNinth Theory.\u2014That these consonantal and vowel combinations\nand their intuitive vocal adjustments may be startling scientific hints\nof mental forces latent in everybody, and which if studied, generalised,\nverified, systematised, and seriously investigated by philosophers might\nprove of incalculable benefit to the human race, but which could find\nno encouragement for expression in the nineteenth century because of\nthe fierce and mocking intolerance of the conservative dogmas of the\nage.\nMy instinct of self-preservation urges me to publish these theories\nsimply to assure those who have new ones that my larder is full for the\npresent, and I don't need them.\nThe foregoing \" foreign\" paragraphs are not all that were given by\nany means, but I have given enough to indicate to the reader the\nphonetic principle employed by the psycho-automatism in keeping me\nin touch with itself, and in the \" worked-up \" condition essential to its\nmanifestation. When it ceased giving me prose, it gave poetry in\n\" unknown tongues.\" As the foreign verbiage came viva voce, I\npencilled it down, mostly in an archaic mono-phonetic form, and the\nsubsequent) blending into diphonetic and other forms was governed by\nthe principle of conjectural euphony. In the poems the number\nof feet in a line was grasped by the recurring of the sound synonyms.\nIn a large number of cases where the letter c had the sound of s, I\nused the letter s. In the foregoing paragraphs I occasionally used two\nee's to convey the long sound of a single e. In my later writing\ndown of the verbiage the sound of hard c was shown by the letter k.\n\f294 Albert Le Baron.\nAs an illustration of the kind of poetry given viva voce by the\npsycho-automatism, I append the following poem with its translation :\u2014\nEde pelute kondo nedode\nIgla tepete kompto pele\nImpe odode inguru lalele\nOmdo resene okoro pododo\nIgme odkondo nefulu kelala\nNene pokonto sefo lodelu\nImpe telala feme olele\nIgde pekondo raog japate\nRele pooddo ogsene lu mano.\nI have been looking, looking for daylight.\nAges have flown and the years have grown dark ;\nOver the hilltops the sun is now shining,\nFar from the sky comes the song of the lark.\nBeauty is dawning, the darkness is passing,\nFar up the vales fly the songs of the light.\nInto the cities the joy will be spreading,\nInto the by-ways the light will be spread ;\nGlory has come to the lost son of man !\nFor me to quote the entire poem with the \" foreign tongue \"\nprecedent, would occupy no less than 272 lines. As a further\nillustration, however, of the phonetic principle employed by the psycho-\nautomatism to keep me in a \" worked up \" state, I append a list of\nforeign words from a note-book containing talks in \" unknown\ntongues \" beginning the first weeks in October, 1894, and closing the\nlast week in April, 1895.\nA very large per cent, of the words I subsequently traced in a\nvocabulary of primitive Dravidian, or British Indian, non-Aryan\nlanguages.\nAru, aar, ama, arde, adaba, asode, asopan, arirao, angora, barabu, bado,\nbede, bete, beme, bere, belu, befo, belo, beja, beod, bepo, bela, bil'e,\nbutebon, bings, bode, bote, bola, bodo, bomo, bondo, boda, bobo, bolo,\nbono, bood, brote, bume, boid, bute, bule, bulo, bubo, bubu, bulu,\nblublu, buto, baba, beto, botu ; ce, cele, condo, comtin, compe, coere,\ncombo, crito, confebo, confo, cimbale ; dape, dara, de, debo, dede, defu,\ndefood, dako, dekon, dikeado, dekan, dege, debe, dole, dela, delu, dera,\ndepin, depe, deso, deme, delulu, delo, delu, delule, delute, demo, deog, depu,\nderne, dinke, dinbe, dode, doig, dobo, doja, do'ine, domo, dolu, dope, dolo,\ndo'se, doog, dongo, dorure, dote, do'le, do're, do'ong, du, dudo, dudu,\ndudedu, du'de, dububo, du'ing, dubudu, du'le, dubu, ducelu, duru, dubuing,\ndutitu ; EE, EEE, erne, ede, ege, edu, elu, ese, ene, ele, ete, eis, eru, edko,\nefrn, este, egle, egpe, eglu, erim, ebede, eklou, edda, edebo, edede, edebe,\nedebu, emete, etepe, etutu, egotes, egtore, egsuro, egypto, esimpe, ecemete,\nedelude, edelute, edeputo, ebedebede ; fara, fatu, fadumba, fapeme, falu,\n\fA Case of Psychic Automatism. 295\nfala, fano, fajo, fao, fape, fado, faton, fapa, fako, fakon, facre, faja, fale,\nfalute, falale, faidme, fase, faod, fare, faig, feme, feja, fele, fedon, fepo, felo,\nfejo, feto, feno, felu, fekura, fetan, fekan, fela, feoglo, fekondo, feredo,\nfiule, fole, foid, fola, fodo, folo, fote, fose, fode, fobo, fota, foja, fojs, fofu,\nfolo, foko, fopo, foso, foto, fope, foka, fomo, fondo, fore, food, fokon, fosan,\nfoigre, foloda, folecon, fosonko, fonoto, Male, fula, fuka, futu, fute, fuja,\nfule, fupe, fulalo, fulela, fukodo, fulo, fure, fuma, futing, fupon, fukolo,\nfuro.\nAs the tracing out of the phonetic forms through the entire\nalphabet would be a bore to any one but a linguist, the foregoing\nmay suffice for illustrative purposes. I visited other towns, and\nreceived viva voce enough additional verbiage at the hotels I stopped\nat to make several chapters. I abandoned my experiments about\nthe end of April, 1895. This was due to the fact, primarily, that I\ncould not, and did not substantiate the verbiage as an actual\nlanguage, although I could trace out a very large number of words\nin actual use among the non-Aryan tribes of British India. Balfour's\n\" Cyclopaedia of British India \" put me on the track of a number of\nwords, also Hunter's vocabulary of the non-Aryan tribes. That\nthere are some laws in mystic psychology not yet understood goes\nwithout saying. That there exists some mental source, defined as a\npsycho-automatism, with which man is capable under certain con\nditions of putting himself en rapport, has been abundantly proven by\nthe praiseworthy efforts of the Society for Psychical Research ; and\nif my desperate plunge at the problem ended in a seeming negation,\nit was not due to any lack of persistency on my part.\n[At the General Meeting of the S.P.R. on April 24th, 1896, when\nthe above paper was read, Mr. P. W. H. Myers made the following\nremarks upon the case, which, at Mr. Le Baron's request, are here\nreprinted.\u2014Ed.]\nMr. Le Baron's experiences are of especial interest as filling a gap\nthat had remained for some time open in the symmetrical series of\ncases which show the progress of each class of automatic verbalisation\nfrom insane incoherence to supernormal instructiveness. In each of\nthe other forms of verbalisation the series is already pretty complete.\nIn word-seeing we start from the meaningless and terrifying words or\nsentences sometimes seen by the insane, as though written in 6re,\nwithout them or within ; we pass through the stage of words seen in\nthe crystal with nothing to point to an origin external to the seer's\nmind ; and we arrive at the supernormal phenomenon of the sight of\nwords in the crystal which convey facts previously unknown to the seer.\nSimilarly in word-hearing we start from the delusions of madness,\n\f296 A Case of Psychic Automatism\nwhen persecuting voices and the like are so often heard; we go on\nto interna] auditions of a monitory kind, which may well proceed from\nthe auditor's own subliminal self ; and finally we come to those\n\" clairaudient \" premonitions which imply the possession of a wider\npurview than the automatist himself had ever\u2014to his own supraliminal\nknowledge\u2014attained. For the third form of verbalisation,\u2014word-\nwriting,\u2014the continuous series from insanity to inspiration is by this\ntime still more familiar to readers of our Proceedings. In each case the\ngradual development from phenomena below into phenomena above the\nnormal standard of personality seems to show that in these special\ndirections the personality is most easily modifiable ; and that subliminal\ndisturbances, whether dissolutive or evolutive, are apt to come to the\nsurface by these as their readiest paths. It is therefore only by a study\nin each case of the actual messages given that we can rightly rank the\nautomatist, either as insane, or as merely a person in whom subliminal\nuprushes are unusually facile, or as a man in some sense inspired with\nfuller knowledge than other men, either by his own hidden spirit, or by\nspirits without him.\nIn the fourth form of verbalisation,\u2014word-utterance,\u2014we have\nuntil now mainly found examples of the lowest and the highest classes.\nThe ceaseless vociferation of mania is familiar to all ; and wonder is\noften expressed at the vigour and persistency of the maniac's utterance,\n\u2014far surpassing the achievements of practised public speakers. Then\nat the other end of the scale we have the utterances which come\nthrough Mrs. Piper, in which (as fresh evidence makes increasingly\nprobable) intelligences other than Mrs. Piper's own are habitually\nconcerned.\nBut for intermediate examples,\u2014for utterance neither insane nor in\nany true sense inspired,\u2014we have thus far had to fall back mainly on\nold records. Chief of these have been the accounts of the Irvingite\nspeaking with tongues. Next, perhaps, comes a little-known work,\n\" Strange Sermons of Rachel Baker,\" which contains two cases of\nsermonising utterance during apparently quite genuine sleep. I need\nnot say that \" trance addresses \" are quite a common feature in spiritist\nreunions. In the very few cases where I have heard these public\naddresses under supposed inspiration, I have felt sure that the speaker\nwas in full possession of his or her ordinary consciousness. But I think\nit very probable that speeches may sometimes be genuinely made in a\ntrance state ;\u2014which would, of course, be no more wonderful than it is\nwhen a hypnotised boy at an entertainment lectures on temperance\nand so forth, and remembers nothing about it when he awakes. The\ntrance may be a mere self-hypnotisation ; \u2014and such, in the absence\nfrom the speech of any facts unknown to the speaker, we are bound to\nconsider it.\n\fA Case of Psychic Automatism. 297\nBut among all these strictly automatic vocalisations, neither insane\nnor inspired, Mr. Le Baron's case is the fullest and most instructive. I\nknow no stronger example of the subjective sense of genius, or rather\nof positive inspiration, accompanying a subliminal uprush of absolutely\nmeaningless matter. Some of this matter, indeed, was meaningless\neven to incoherence,\u2014consisting of \" unknown tongues,\" which are\npretty certainly destined to remain unknown. One cannot but note,\nwith satisfaction at our present progress, yet with deep regret at the\nsad story of the past, the different way in which these so-called tongues\nwere treated in Irving's time and in our own. Several, at least, of the\nspeakers with tongues in Irving's congregation were, I have no doubt,\nperfectly sincere ; and Irving himself was, as all know, a man of\nprobity and elevation. Yet his ignorance\u2014his unavoidable ignorance\n\u2014of the phenomena of automatism landed him and his flock first in\nnatural mistake, but at last in obstinate credulity, and spoilt the close\nof a . noble and high career. In Mr. Le Baron's case, on the other\nhand, the automatist himself had the courage and candour to estimate\nhis utterances in the calm light of science, in spite of strong subjective\ninducement to continue to assign to them a value which they did not\npossess. He had the good fortune, I need hardly add, to meet with a\nwise and gentle adviser, and the phenomenon which, if differently\ntreated, might have led on to the delusion of many, and perhaps to the\ninsanity of one, became to the one a harmless experience, and to the\nworld an acquisition of interesting psychological truth. If our Society\nshall continue thus to tend to convert enthusiasm into science and peril\ninto instruction, it will not have existed in vain.\nF. W. H. Myers.\n\f298 Professor Henry Sidgwiclc. [Supplement.\nSUPPLEMENT.\ni.\nINVOLUNTARY WHISPERING CONSIDERED IN RELATION\nTO EXPERIMENTS IN THOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE.\nBy Professor Henry Sidgwick.\nIn a pamphlet of 60 pages, published in Wundt's Philosophische Studien,\n(Vol. XL, Part 4), Messrs. Lehmann and Hansen, of Copenhagen, give\nthe results of a series of experiments in what they call\u2014the term seems\nto me not quite exact\u2014\"involuntary whispering\"; and on the basis of\nthese results, they endeavour to show that the apparent success of two\nseries of experiments in thought-transference of numbers, recorded in\nthese Proceedings (Vol. VI., pp. 128\u2014170, and Vol. VIII., pp. 536\u2014552),\nmay be explained by supposing the agent, Mr. G. A. Smith, to have un\nconsciously whispered the numbers. This explanation is in no way novel ;\nin fact, attention was expressly called to it in the record of our first series\nof these experiments, Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 164-6. We there speak of\nit in the following terms :\u2014\n\"It is necessary to examine the experiments dealt with in this paper\nwith anxious care, in order to see whether there was any possible channel\nof sense through which the agent's impression could have reached the\npercipients.\" We show briefly that \"we are reduced to the sense of\nhearing.\" Then we say, \"There seem to be only two ways in which the\nimpression could have reached the percipient through his ears\u2014either by\nmeans of faint unconscious whispering of the number by Mr. Smith in the\neffort of concentrating his attention on it, or by means of faint unconscious\ncounting of the number by breathing, or some other rhythmical movement\nproducing sound. ... Of the two suppositions, unconscious whisper\ning seems the less improbable, because the concentration of the mind on a\nwritten or printed number, with a view to having as intense an impression\nof it as possible, is found to cause a certain tendency to say the number\nmentally, but no tendency to count it.\"\nWe had then in view \"faint unconscious whispering\" as the least\nimprobable explanation of our results, supposing that there was no genuine\nthought-transference.\nAt the same time I fully admit that the experiments of Messrs. Lehmann\nand Hansen have placed this probability in a new light.\nThat is, they have certainly proved experimentally\u2014what, in our\ndiscussion we could only surmise as possible\u2014 that a number of two digits\nmay be communicated from agent to percipient, by faint whispering with\nclosed lips, so that a bystander in a slightly less favourable position for\nhearing than the percipient would hear no sound and probably observe no\nexternal signs of movement of the organs of speech. I say \"probably\"\nbecause so far as I have myself been able to imitate these experiments, I\n\fSupplement.] 299\nInvoluntary Whispering.\nshould say that if the observer directed his attention to the neck and throat\ninstead of the lips, he could hardly fail to detect such signs ; but unless he\nhad the possibility of whispering with closed lips clearly in his mind, he\nwould probably consider it enough to watch the lips, and give no special\nattention to the neck and throat.\nI will briefly describe the experiments of Messrs. Lehmann and Hansen.\nThey placed two concave spherical mirrors opposite each other, the distance\nbetween the two foci being two metres ; so that when the head of the agent\nwas in one focus and the head of the percipient in the other, the concentra\ntion of the sound by the mirrors might be a substitute for the hyperaesthesia\nwhich they supposed to exist in the hypnotised subjects of our experiments.\nUnder these conditions Messrs. Lehmann and Hansen attained a consider\nable degree of success in hearing each other's (so-called) \"involuntary\"\nwhispering. It appears to me that \"semi-voluntary\" would be a better\nterm than \"involuntary,\" because the experimenters were conscious of\ngiving way partially, but only partially, to the impulse to innervate the\nvocal muscles which they found to accompany the concentration of thought\non a definite number. (I lay stress on this, because my own experience is\nthat I cannot consciously make an audible whisper which is in any degree\ninvoluntary). In any case the mouth of the agent was firmly closed ; and\nwe are told that \" no movements of the lips were visible, and a bystander\ncould not hear any sounds.\" The experimenters do not, however, give\nany record of systematic observations by a bystander, or state where\nhe was placed ; they merely say generally that \"all this was confirmed by\nHerr Buch, an assistant of the laboratory, who was once (!) present at the\nexperiments.\" Accordingly, in performing a series of experiments in imita\ntion of those of Messrs. Lehmann and Hansen\u2014but omitting the apparatus\nof mirrors\u2014I paid special attention to this point. I found that it was quite\npossible for an observer, fixing his gaze on the agent's mouth, neither to\nhear or see any sign of a whisper at a distance of two feet from the agent, while\nthe percipient, at a distance which varied, but was ultimately extended to\n18 inches\u2014measured from the agent's mouth to the percipient's ear\u2014heard\nwith sufficient distinctness to attain a considerable amount of success in\nguessing. The whisperer in my experiments was sometimes my wife, and\nsometimes Miss Johnson ; but I ought to say that in both cases\u2014as also in\nmy own case when I made the attempt\u2014the whispering was completely\nvoluntary ; we could none of us detect in ourselves the slightest tendency to\nthe semi-voluntary whispering described by Messrs. Lehmann and Hansen.\nAt the same time, with their experience before us, I must admit it to be\npossible that Mr. Smith may have whispered unconsciously in such a manner\nthat\u2014assuming hyperaesthesia in the hypnotised percipient\u2014he might in\nsome cases have been heard by the percipient without being observed by his\nfellow-investigators. I ought, however, to say that\u2014as stated in Proceedings,\nVol.VI., p. 165\u2014we found nothing to suggest that the percipients were ever\nhyperaesthetic, though we were on the look-out for evidence of this. I must\nsay further that I see no reason for regarding it as at all probable that Mr.\nSmith whispered unconsciously, since (1) his attention had been called to the\ndanger of doing so, and (2) his effort was concentrated on the visualisation\nof the number ; and both these conditions must, it would seem, tend to\n\f300 Professor Henry Sidgwick. [Supplement.\nprevent involuntary whispering. Again, the experience of Messrs. Lehmann\nand Hansen gives no ground for the supposition that unconscious whispering\nis likely to be unperceived by the observers. On the contrary, Dr. Hansen\nexpressly says that \"at first there was a tendency to whisper too loud,\"\nwhich had to be \" half-consciously \" checked; and, certainly, the process\nof whispering with closed lips\u2014which they ultimately adopted for the\nexperiments\u2014is, according to our experience, a markedly artificial one,\nwhich it requires some practice to carry out successfully. I may add that I\nhave lately made further experiments in thought-transference of numbers\nwith Mr. Smith without giving him any hint of my special aim in so doing ;\nin which, besides listening close and attentively, I have concentrated my\nvisual observation on possible signs of movement in the submaxillary region,\nwhere my other experiments had taught me to look for them ; and have been\nunable to detect the slightest sign of a whisper. Nor was any sound of\nwhispering detected by Mrs. Verrall, who acted as percipient, and who had\npractised herself in hearing the whispers of my wife and Miss Johnson.\nStill, in spite of all this, unconscious whispering and hyperaesthesia\ncombined give a possible explanation of the results of our experiments, so far\nas they were performed with agent and percipient in the same room : and\naccordingly this, on our principles, would have to be accepted as the most\nprobable explanation, if experiments of this kind constituted the only\nevidence for thought-transference. This I fully admit.\nThe contention of the Danish investigators, however, goes considerably\nfurther than this. They endeavour, by an elaborate comparison of the\nunsuccessful guesses in their experiments and ours respectively, to show\nstrong positive reasons for concluding that the same mode of communication\nwas operative in both cases.\nThis part of their argument appears to me quite inconclusive.\nThey made altogether 500 experiments, taking the parts of agent and\npercipient alternately, so that each made 250 guesses. The experiments,\nlike ours, were made with numbers of two digits. The results are given in a\ntabulated form in their paper, and we have reproduced their table at the end\nof this paper as Table A. The results of our experiments, which they\ncompare with their own, were given in a similar table in Proceedings S.P.R.,\nVol. VI., p. 168.1 We reproduce the essential part of this table as Table B.\nIt shows how often each numeral (the two digits being counted separately)\nwas drawn, and all the guesses that were made for it. Comparing the two\nsets of results, they endeavour to show that the same wrong guesses of one\nnumeral for another\u2014which we will speak of as \" substitutions \"\u2014occur in\nboth Tables, to an extent that renders it a probable inference that the same\ncause\u2014whispering\u2014was operative in both cases. For this purpose, they\ncompare the four substitutions made most frequently for each numeral in\nthe two cases. The result2 shows that out of the two sets of 40 substitutions\nthus compared, 28 are common to the two sets. (We will speak of these as\n\"correspondences.\") This is, no doubt, an amount of agreement decidedly\nin excess of what would most probably occur by mere chance. But a glance\nat Tables A. and B. will show that the agreement is exaggerated. The four\n1 They are reproduced in Dr. Lehmann's paper as Table V., p. 486.\n2 This result is given in Dr. Lehmann's paper aa Table VI., p. 487.\n\fsupplement.] Involuntary Whispering. 301\nsubstitutions most frequently made for each numeral are not determinate ;\nas there are a good many cases in each Table in which two or more numerals\nare guessed with equal frequency for another. In such cases of equality Dr.\nLehmann has uniformly made the selection most favourable to the conclusion\nwhich he wishes to prove ; and I find that if the selection had been made on\nthe opposite principle, his total of correspondences would have been reduced\nfrom 28 to 221. This much diminishes the impressiveness of his comparison ;\nand its effect will, I think, be altogether destroyed by a simple empirical test\nwhich our own experiments have enabled me to make.\nAdopting Dr. Lehmann's plan of comparison, I have compared the\nthought-transference experiments of Table B. with a series of experiments\nin which we may assume that the guesses made were pure guesses and had\nno relation whatever, other than accidental, with the numbers drawn. The\nseries thus used is the set of distant experiments with Miss B. mentioned in\nProceedings S.P.R., Vol. VIII., p. 547, which we have tabulated below in\nTable C. In these, the agent and percipient were either in different build\nings or divided from one another by at least two closed doors and a passage.\nThe number of experiments tried under these conditions was 383 (that is,\n766 digits guessed) and the successful guesses (about 11 per cent.) were\nclearly due to mere chance. This series, compared with the thought-\ntransference series (Table B.) in regard to the substitutions made for each\nnumeral, gives a maximum number of 27 correspondences and a minimum\nnumber of 25. If the maximum here is not quite so much above the average\nas in the comparison of the series of Tables A. and B., the minimum is\nmore so, so that it cannot be said that the second comparison shows a less\nclose agreement between the two series compared than the first. Yet, as in\nthe series of pure guesses there was no transfer at all, the cause of the agree\nment cannot be that an identical mode of transfer operated in both series.2\nSo far, I have followed Dr. Lehmann in comparing the four substitutions\nfor each numeral which occur most frequently in the unsuccessful guesses\nin the two sets of results. But I do not think the plan of comparison a\nparticularly good one ; because it requires us, in some cases, to include\nsubstitutions which occur hardly oftener\u2014or even in some cases less often \u2014\nthan the average number of times ; and it does not seem reasonable to try to\ninfer a law governing the substitutions from those which do not occur\ndecidedly oftener than the average. Let us turn then, to enquire whether\n1 1 observe that Dr. Lehmann himself\u2014 when comparing these experiments\nwith a set of numbers arrived at through imperfectly apprehended visual impressions\n\u2014treats 22 correspondences as a number which might not improbably occurby chance.\n2 I need not go into the more elaborate estimate of probabilities given by Dr.\nLehmann on pp. 491\u20142, because the method used is fallacious. The improbability of\nthe fortuitous occurrence of a particular number and arrangement of the correspond\nences in question, is not in itself a measure of the probability that the cause was the\ndetermination of the two series compared by a common mode of transfer. This can\nbe seen at once by taking an extreme case. It might happen that there were no\ncorrespondences at all. The probability of this is, of course, extremely small, viz.,\n(T|T)10. \u00b0r> using Dr. Lehmann's notation, i_ W210, but it would be obviously\nabsurd to say that therefore the same phonetic laws must have operated in determining\nthe two series compared.\n\f302 Professor Henry Sidgwick. [S upplement\nanything can be inferred from a comparison for each numeral of the one\nmost frequent substitution. The following table shows these substitutions :\u2014\nFor\n0\nSubstitutions in Whispered\"!\nseries (A) \/\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n5 3 5 5 7 5 5 3 4 5\nSubstitutions in Thought-\\\ntransference series (B) ...\/ 5 3 2 3 6 7 2 3 3 3\nSubstitutions in series of\\\nmere guesses (C) \/\n3 5 4 3 6 5 2 5 3 3\nDr. Lehmann lays great stress (p. 490) on the fact that the most frequent\nsubstitution is in five cases common to the thought-transference series and\nthe whispered series, namely 5 for 1, 3 for 2, 6 for 5, 7 for 6, and 3 for 8.\nTwo of these are, it will be observed, ambiguous, 6 and 7 being guessed with\nequal frequency for 5, and 7 and 5 for 6 in the whispered series. Still,\nwithout these there are three agreements. The apparent significance of this\nis, however, neutralised when we observe that there are five similar\ncorrespondences between the thought-transference series and the series of\nmere guesses.\nAnother way of comparing would be to take, say, the ten substitutions\nmost often made in the whole of each series. These are as follows :\u2014\nWhispering (A) Thought ti.ansference (B) Mere guessing (C)\n7guessed for 6, 20 times 3 guessed for 8, 26 times 6{juessed for 5, 18 times\nS \u201e 6, 20 >\u00bb 2 SS ?> 3, 24 \u201e 4 is ss 3, 17 \u201e\n6 \u00bb \u201e 17 S> 5 S\u25a0 \u201e 1. 22 \u201e 3 SS SS 4, 17 \u201e\n5 ss \u201e 7, 15 S> 3 \u201e 4, 22 \u201e 3 ss ss 1, 16 \u201e\n3 Ss ,, 2, 13 3S 3 SS >S 2, 21 \u201e 5 ss ss 2, 16 \u201e\n5 ss \u201e 1, 12 \u00bb 1 Ss .. *, 21 \u201e 2 ss ss 7, 16 \u201e\n3 SS \u201e 8, 12 \u00bb\u00bb 2 SS ss Is 21 \u201e 1 ss ss 5, 15 \u201e\n8 SS \u201e 2, 11 a 3 SS \u201e 1, 20 \u201e\u25a0 5 ss ss 7, 15 \u201e\n4 SS 7, 11 SS 6 ss ss 6, 19 \u201e 5 ss ss s, 15 \u201e\n3 \u25a0s \u201e 6, 10 SS 2 SS , 1, ]8 \u201e 6 ss ss 4, 141 \u201e\n1 Five other substitutions occur in this series 14 times. The one selected is that\nwhich, taking into consideration both its line and its column, seems relatively the\nmost frequent. One of the remaining five, namely, 5 for 1, is common to both the\notherseries, and would therefore have made five correspondences between the thought-\ntransference series and the series of mere guesses.\n\fsupplement.] Involuntary Whispering. 303\nHere we have four correspondences between the thought-transference\nseries and the series of mere guesses, and only three between the thought-\ntransference and whispering ; that is, again a larger number of correspond\nences with the series of guesses. It is clear, therefore, from all these\nvarious ways of considering the matter, that the correspondence between\nthe substitutions made in the thought-transference series of Table B. and\nthe series of mere guesses is at least as close as that between the thought-\ntransference and the whispered series.1\nHere I may be asked, \" Have you no positive explanation of the amount\nof correspondence found in the three series compared 1 \" In answer, I\nwould suggest that it is due to a certain amount of agreement in the\n\"number-habits\" of the percipients, i.e., their unconscious bias in favour\nof particular numbers. In the three series that we have been discussing,\nthe prevalence among the erroneous guesses of certain numbers is marked.\nIn Table B, the numerals 3, 2, 5, 4, 6 are the five most frequently guessed\nerroneously. In our series of mere guesses (C), the same numbers, in the\norder, 5, 2, 3, 6, 4, are the favourites ; while in the whispered series of\nMessrs. Lehmann and Hansen (A), 5, 3, 7, 4, are guessed above the mean\nnumber of times, 2 coming next in frequency. Now, in the series of mere\nguesses, this result can only be due to some subjective tendency in the\nguesser to select by preference the favoured numbers ; and if so, we may\nreasonably suppose that the same cause operated in the other two series.\nAnd this is confirmed by an examination of the distribution of the erroneous\nguesses. We find (e.g.) that 5\u2014the numeral most frequently guessed\nerroneously in the Danish table\u2014is the most frequent erroneous guess for\n1, 3, 4, 6 (ambiguously), 7, and 0. It is surely unreasonable to suppose that\nthe preference for 5 in all these cases is due to its peculiar phonetic affinities\nwith all the six numerals for which it is preferentially substituted ; we must\ntherefore attribute its frequency largely to \"number-habit.\"2\n1A similar comparison of Dr. Lehmann's and Dr. Hansen's guesses with each other\ngives between the four most frequent substitutions for each numeral a maximum of\n23 and a minimum of 1G correspondences ; between themost frequent substitutions for\neach numeral in each series, three correspondences ; between the ten most frequent\nsubstitutions in each series two correspondences and one ambiguous one ; so that the\nagreement of these two series, which are arrived at by the same process, is not very\nclose.\n2 Tendencies to guess particular numerals show various peculiarities. They are\ndifferent, for instance, with the same percipient for the two digits, and that obviously\nindependently of indications by hearing or otherwise. We have three different series\nwith Miss B., described in our Proceedings, Vol. VIII. ; one, a series of experiments\nwith agent and percipient in the same room, which was very successful ; the second,\nthe series with agent and percipient in different rooms, which is shown in a tabulated\nform in Table D at the end of this paper, and which was moderately successful ;\nthe third was the series C, of which we have been speaking, in which there was no\nsuccess at all. Omitting in all cases the successes, we find that in each series Miss B.\nnamed 1, 2, 3, and 5 above the mean number of times as a first digit (tens), and 3, 4,\n6, and 8 above the mean number of times as a second digit (units). (They were not\nalways in the same order.) Eight never occurs above the mean number of times as\na first digit, nor 1 as a second, nor 0 or 9 as either. Our other percipients, P. and T.,\nwho were the percipients most concerned with the experiments of Table B. exhibit\nconsiderable agreement. Both of them name 2, 3, and 4, above the mean number of\nX\n\f304 Professor Henry Sidgwick. [Supplement.\nFurther confirmation is given by my own experiments in whispering in\nimitation of those of Messrs. Lehmann and Hansen.\nFor when we consider the favourite numerals in the unsuccessful guesses\nin both sets of experiments, we find, at first sight, a certain amount of\nagreement.\nAs the favourite numerals in my series are 5, 2, 3, 6\u2014in this order,\nwhile, as we have seen,\nThe favourite numerals in the Danish series are 5, 3, 7, 4 (2 coming\nnext).\nBut when we examine the exact substitutions in both cases, we find that\nthe agreement vanishes.\nFor in the Danish experiments, taken together,\n5 is erroneously guessed most often for 6 (20 times out of 93)\nand with next degree of frequency for 4 (17 times),\nbut for 3 only 8 times.\nWhereas, in ray experiments,\n5 is erroneously guessed most often for 3 (21 times out of 92),\nnext for 7 (20 times).\nWhile it is only guessed 4 times for 6,\nand only once (!) for 4.\nThis analysis seems to me to demonstrate clearly that the preference for\n5 in both sets of experiments must be attributed mainly to \"number-habit,\"\nand not to the similar operation of phonetic laws of substitution in the two\nets of experiments.\nThe only way in which such laws can be reasonably supposed to have\noperated is in causing 5 to be guessed erroneously for 7.\nThis occurs, as was said, 20 times in my experiments,\nand also 17 times in the Danish experiments (7 being next\nin frequency to 6 and 4).\nI find that in my experiments this tendency to guess 5 for 7 is found\nentirely in the case of the first digit\u201450 is remarkably often guessed for 70,\nbut not 5 for 7.\nI may observe that in my experiments 70 appears by far the hardest\nsound to catch. It is only guessed correctly 8 times out of 49, while 50 is\nsubstituted for it 15 times and 30 twelve times ; 7 is also a difficult sound :\nit is only guessed right 11 times out of 40 ; but there is no preference for 5\nas a substitute for it.\nMessrs. Lehmann and Hansen have, of course, an entirely different\nexplanation of the agreement between the whispered series and the thought-\ntransference series. Dr. Hansen has made a very careful examination of the\nnumbers incorrectly guessed in the Danish experiments ; and he thinks that\nin the majority of cases he can trace the error to some regularly operating\nphonetic law, leading to that particular mishearing. It is, no doubt, a priori\nprobable that the incorrect guessing in the whispered series would be partly\ntraceable to such laws.

Drs. Lehmann and\nHansen seem to agree less well. Dr. Lehmann's greatest favourites are 5 and 3, and\nDr. Hansen's 5 and 7. We have no means of comparing their first and second digits.\n\fSupplement.] Involuntary Whispering. 305\nLehmann and Dr. Hansen exhibited marked differences in the relative\nfrequency with which they made particular substitutions1\u2014I cannot think\nthat the data are sufficient to establish empirically the large number of\nphonetic laws which Dr. Hansen lays down.\nIt is, of course, easy for Dr. Hansen to show that in certain cases the\nincorrect guesses in our thought-transference experiments are in accordance\nwith one or other of his numerous phonetic laws ; and, as he does not\nattempt more than this, I think that\u2014after the proof that I have given of\nthe failure of Dr. Lehmann's attempt to establish the general probability\nthat unconscious whispering operated in our experiments, \u2014I need not enter\ninto a detailed discussion of Dr. Hansen's laws. But I may observe that his\nwhole treatment of our results appears to ignore the part that chance un\ndoubtedly played in producing them. The cause of the transfer of numbers,\n\u2014whether telepathy or whispering, or something different from either,\u2014was\nnot always operative ; there were whole days when we had no success beyond\nchance. It is of no use looking for laws of deviation when there is no normal\nto deviate from, and on these completely unsuccessful days we must assume\nthat no impression of the real number reached the percipient, through his\near or otherwise, and that, therefore, he could not mishear it. It is, there\nfore, certain that those of our percipients' impressions which occurred on\nthese days were determined by chance. But it can, I think, be shown that\nothers were so too. Let us suppose that in a series of experiments, the\nnumbers of which both digits are guessed right are by some means\u2014tele\npathic or other\u2014transferred, but that no others are, the others being merely\nchance guesses. Then, after taking out the complete successes, so far as they\nexceed what chance would be likely to give, the remaining guesses would be\ndistributed by chance. There would be no half-successes, (i e., successful\nguesses of one digit only, in its right place) beyond what chance would\nproduce. And that is what we actually find to be the case in our percipient\nT.'s guesses of first digits, i.e., digits in the units' place.2 If the first and\nsecond digits (tens and units) in T.'s experiments are tabulated separately,\nwe find that in second digits there are 51 successes in 246 guesses. But\n30 of these successes belong to complete successes, leaving only 21 for\nhalf-successes. By chance we should have expected about three complete\nsuccesses. If wo take out the other 27, we have 219 guesses, with 24\n1 Apart from successes, there were only 458 single numerals to distribute\nover 90 places, of which only 7 were left blank. The most numerous substitu\ntions were 5 and 7 for 6, each of which occurred 20 times ; but whereas 7 for 6\nwas a substitution frequently made by Dr. Hansen, it was rarely made by Dr.\nLehmann \u2014who, on the other hand, favoured the substitution of 5 for 6 considerably\nmore than Dr. Hansen did.\n2 Dr. Hansen complains (p. 526) that we have adopted the coarse method of\ntabulating first and second digits together instead of separately, bo that Dr. Lehmann\nwas obliged to do the same, and thus some substitutions are, in his view, less easily\nexplained than they might otherwise have been. I think the complaint somewhat\nunreasonable. We have given a complete list of every number drawn and the\ncorresponding guess, so that Drs. Lehmann and Hansen could have tabulated them\nin any manner convenient for their investigation. I am not surprised that they did\nnot think it worth while to do so. I only point out that they had the material there,\n\u2014which is more than we have as regards their experiments.\nx 2\n\f306 Professor Henry Sidgwiclc. [Supplement.\nsuccesses, and the most probable number of successes is -^L= 22. Apart,\ntherefore, from complete successes, there is really no indication of any\ntransfer in T.'s second digits. They appear to have been merely chance\nguesses.1\nA careful perusal of our paper in Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VI., will\nreveal other cases in which the percipient's impression was certainly deter\nmined by causes entirely independent of the number drawn. It is, therefore,\ncertain that in a large proportion of the incorrect guesses of our Table B., it is\nperfectly idle to search for exemplifications of phonetic laws.\nTo return : I hold, for the reasons above given, that Messrs. Lehmann\nand Hansen have failed to furnish any positive evidence of the operation of\nunconscious whispering in our experiments. I have, however, admitted\nthat their explanation of our results would still be the most probable one, if\nour successful experiments in thought-transference had been confined to the\ntransfer of numbers with agent and percipient in the same room. But, as\nour readers know, this is by no means the case. A strong reason for thinking\nthat unconscious whispering was not the cause of success in these experiments\nlies in the success in the series described by Mrs. Sidgwick and Miss Johnson\nin Proceedings S.P.B., Vol. VIII., pp. 536\u2014596, in which the agent and\npercipient (Miss B.) were in different rooms, separated by a considerable\ndistance and a closed door. The conditions are, we can assure Dr. Lehmann,\naccurately described, and, as he admits (p. 493), it follows that if whispering\nis the explanation of the success attained, the percipient on the one hand\nmust have had an almost fabulous hyperaesthesia of hearing and the agent\non the other must have whispered so loud that it is inconceivable that the\npersons present should not have remarked it. He can only suggest that, as\nsounds are differently audible at different points of a room, and sometimes\nmore audible at some point more distant from the source than at a nearer\none, it may have happened that the relative positions of agent and percipient\nwere favourable for hearing, while the relative positions of the agent and the\nperson with him were not. I think that this hypothesis is in any case\nextravagant, considering the closed door, but it is rendered still more inad\nmissible by the fact that the percipient's position within the room was\nintentionally often varied, and that the relative positions of the agent and the\nperson with him were varied also. And it will be remembered also that the\nexperiments succeeded in two different sets of apartments. I believe it to be\nimpossible that unconscious whispering can have been the mode of transfer\nin these experiments.2\n1 P. was about equally successful with both digits during the series of experiments\nhere discussed. Miss B. in the experiments in separate rooms (see Table D) had,\nlike T., practically no half-successes beyond chance in second digits, but was very\nsuccessful in first digits.\n2 It may interest the reader,\u2014though, after what we have said, it will be under\nstood that we attach no particular importance to the fact,\u2014to observe that a com\nparison of the four most frequent substitutions for each numeral in this thought-\ntransference series with Miss B. (Table D.) gives, when compared with the series of\nmere guesses (Table C), a maximum of 25 correspondences and a minimum of 24 ;\ncompared with the thought-transference series of Table B., a maximum of 25 and a\nminimum of 22, and compared with the whispered series of Table A , a maximum of\n24 and a minimum of 20. If we take the one most frequent substitution for each\n\fsupplement.] Involuntary Whispering. 307\nBefore leaving the subject of whispering, I will reply to one or two of\nDr. Hansen's remarks about our experiments. At p. 526, he complains that\nwe did not, in discussing the possibility of mishearing, distinguish between\nfirst and second digits, and attributes this to our probably having formed the\nconclusion beforehand that the appearance, and not the sound, of the number\nwas the important matter. Drs. Lehmann and Hansen quite mistake our\nviews about visual impressions,\u2014but to that I will return later. In lumping\ntogether in the Table the first and second digits, we were influenced by two\nconsiderations. The first is that, if there was unconscious whispering, it is\nimpossible to know whether it took the form of whispering the whole\nnumber as a number of two digits, or of whispering each digit separately.\nThe second method would naturally be suggested by the independent way in\nwhich the two digits seemed generally to strike the percipients ; and it must\nbe remembered that Mr. Smith was consciously concentrating his efforts on\na vivid visualisation of the two digits ; in fact, he used to say sometimes that\nhe concentrated his mind first on one digit and then on the other. The\nsecond consideration that led to our printing only one table was that, even\nso, the number of experiments was too small in our opinion to enable us to\ndraw any very certain inferences as to the causes that may contribute to the\nparticular distribution, apart from the successes. The numbers are dis\ntributed among 90 places, besides those occupied by successful guesses, and\nwe know that the distribution is at least in great part accidental, so that\nthere is not much margin left to work upon.\nAs Dr. Hansen points out, in thus combining first and second digits, we\nhave ignored the resemblance of \"teen\" and \"ty\" and the difference\nbetween \"three\" and \"thirty.\" The interchangeability of \"teen\" and\n\" ty \" he regards as of great importance. If the first and second digits of our\nexperiments (complete lists of them are given in the paper in Proceedings\nS.P.R., Vol. VI.) be tabulated separately on the same plan as the other\ntables we have been using, the substitutions of \"ty\"for \"teen \"will be\nshown by the first line of the table of first digits (tens). If specially liable to\nhappen, this substitution will lead to 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 being in the\naggregate often guessed for 1, and to a small number of correct guesses of 1.\nOn the other hand, the substitutions of \" teen \" for \" ty \" are shown by the\nfirst column of the table, and, if specially liable to happen, will make the\nsubstitutions of 1 for 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 in the aggregate relatively\nfrequent. It will be found that none of these things occur. One is not a\nnumeral which our percipients were specially successful in guessing correctly,\nbut it was about as often right as a first digit as it was as a second.1 If\nnumeral, we find that series D. has in common with each of the above series, taken in\nthe same order, two correspondences and one ambiguous one, four and one ambiguous\none, and one and one ambiguous one, respectively. The ten most frequent substitu\ntions for each series have in common two, four, and one, respectively. By none of these\nmethods of comparison, therefore, is any marked agreement shown between series\nD. and the whispered series.\n1 In the experiments with Miss B. and the agent in different rooms (Table D.),\n27 of the successful guesses of 1 occurred with first digits (tens), and only 16 with\nsecond digits. \"Teen\" was guessed as \"ty \" only 11 times, which is much below\nthe average ; and *\" ty \" was turned into \"teen \" also below the average number of\ntimes.\n\f308 [Supplement.\nProfessor Henry Sidgwiclc.\ntherefore Dr. Hansen is right in thinking that interchanges of \" teen \" and\n\" ty \" would be specially liable to occur when unconscious whispering is the\nmode of communication, the argument, as far as it goes, is against the\nhypothesis that whispering occurred in our experiments.\nThe special interest of the numeral 3 depends on its having been rather\noften substituted for 8 in our experiments. As Dr. Hansen points out in\na foot-note, the resemblance in sound between \"thirty\" and \"eighty\" is\nmuch greater than between \"three\" and \"eight.\" But if our experiments\nbe examined, it will be found that the prevalence of 3 for 8 is, in the first\nplace, entirely due to one percipient, P. ; and in the second, that he makes\nthis substitution 1 1 times in the case of first digits (tens), and 10 times in\nthe case of second digits (units). In the case of both digits, it is the most\nfrequent substitution he makes, but its pre-eminence, compared to other\nsubstitutions, is more marked in the case of the second digits. It does not\nappear, therefore, that there is any force in Dr. Hansen's arguments to show\nthat, by tabulating together the first and second digits, we have obscured\nthe phonetic nature of the substitutions.\nAs I have said, I do not propose to discuss Dr. Hansen's explanations of\nsome individual experiments of our series ; since every numeral is sub\nstituted more or less frequently for every other, it is clear that, whatever\nthe laws of phonetic interchanges may be, some apparent examples of them\nmust be found among our experiments. I will only point out that one\nat least of his hypothetical explanations\u2014twice repeated\u2014is not tenable.\nHe suggests that the guessing of 0 for 7 is due to the resemblance of the\nwords \" seven \" and \" zero.\" But the name of the numeral 0 is not \"zero \"\nin English ; it is always spoken of as \" nought \" or \"ought, \" and there is no\nresemblance between these sounds and \"seven.\"\nWe have now to discuss from the point of view of visual impressions the\nmistakes that were made. Dr. Lehmann attributes to us the opinion that the\nthought of the agent called up directly visual images1 in the brain of the per\ncipient by means of an at present unknown form of energy. Dr. Lehmann\nhas misapprehended our meaning. We did not intend to put forward any\ntheory as to the process of thought-transference : we were solely concerned\nwith establishing the fact that communications may pass from one mind to\nanother otherwise than through the recognised channels of sense.\nThe passage from which Drs. Lehmann and Hansen infer our theory is\nthe following2 :\u2014\" Eight mistakes were made twenty times or more. These\nwere : 1 guessed as 3 and as 5, 2 guessed as 3, 3 guessed as 2, 4 guessed as 1\nand as 3, 7 guessed as 2 and 8 guessed as 3. Of these eight, only three\ncould possibly be explained by unconscious counting, viz., 3 for 2, 2 for 3, and\n3 for 4. But of these, the two first might equally well be explained as results\nof the kind of imperfect vision of the number so often complained of by the\npercipients, and this is also the explanation suggested by the most prevalent\nmistake of all, namely, 8 guessed as 3. And that this is the true explanation\n1 Lehmann, p. 487. \" Die genannten Autoren nehmen, wie wir gesehen haben,\nan, dass die Gedanken des Absenders, vermittelat einer noch unbekaunten Form der\nEnergie im Gehirn des Empfangers direct Gesichtsbilder hervorgerufen haben.\"\n(See also p. 479.)\n^ Proceedings S.P.\"R., Vol. VI., pp. 169-170.\n\fsupplement.] Involuntary Whispering. 309\nis further suggested by the fact that 3 is very seldom guessed as 8. For\nthough an 8 half rubbed out might resemble a 3, a 3 could not so easily be\nconverted into a badly seen 8, whereas with 2 and 3 the possibility of\nmistake would be reciprocal ; an imperfect 2 might be mistaken for a 3 as\neasily as a 3 for a 2. On the whole, therefore, we think that an examination\nof the facts affords no support worth considering for the supposition\u2014in\nitself, as we have said, extremely improbable\u2014of unconscious counting\nhypenesthetically heard.\"\nThe suggestion here is that the errors, so far as they go, point rather to\ndefective externalisation than to defective transmission by counting. This\nin no way implies the direct transference of a visual impression, though it is\nnot inconsistent with it. Our percipients in this series of experiments\nalmost always became conscious of the idea through what, in a broad use of\nthe term, may be called a visual hallucination. It was certainly more than\na mere mental image, and we only hesitate about calling it a hallucination\nbecause the percipients generally had their eyes closed, so that we cannot\njudge to what extent their number visions would have competed with the\nvisual sensations derived from external objects. But whatever name be\ngiven to the species of their impression,\u2014and this is discussed at some length\nin the paper referred to, pp. 158-163,\u2014there is no doubt, we think, that they\nfirst saw the number and then thought of it, not that they first thought of it\nand then saw it . They were not conscious of it until they saw it. This was,\nas we state, probably due to our own suggestion. In later experiments\n(Proceedings S.P.R. Vol. VIII.), the ideas were similarly caused to reach the\nconsciousness of the percipients through auditory hallucinations, through\nautomatic writing and through table tilting. But in none of these cases did\nwe suppose that the mode in which the percipient became conscious of the\nidea threw any light on the question how it originally reached his mind. We\nbelieved ourselves to have stated this clearly in our paper. It is almost\ncertain that the ideas sometimes reached the percipient through the ear, as\nwhen P. and T. imitated each other's guesses ;\u2014though, so far as we could\nascertain, they could not consciously hear each other, owing to being\nhypnotised and not put en rapport with each other. \" We must\ntherefore suppose \" to quote our previous words (see Proceedings, Vol. VI.,\np. 164), \" that sounds which fell unconsciously on the ear yet produced an\nimpression on the mind, of which the percipient became aware solely\nthrough its reproduction in a visual form\u2014a supposition which is, of course,\nentirely in accordance with observations made by others.\" At other times,\nas we have seen, the impressions seem to have been the result of pure\nguess-work, or,\u2014what is for practical purposes the same,\u2014produced by a\nvariety of unrelated causes acting in opposition to one another. It is clear\nthat the impressions sometimes came from Mr. Smith's mind,\u2014how trans\nmitted, whether through the senses or telepathically, is the question at issue.\nIf telepathically, it may have been the name or the visual impression, i.e.,\nthe form, that was transmitted. But that there was direct transmission from\nvisual organs to visual organs is rendered improbable by the fact that the\nprocess of perception by the percipient was identical, so far as we could\njudge, whether the idea reached him from Mr. Smith, or orally from his\nco-percipient, or was the result of his own invention.\n\f310 Professor Henry Sidgivick. [Supplement\nOur point was that, in the transmission of an idea to the percipient's\nconscious intelligence, error may occur in two ways ; either through the idea\nbeing imperfectly transferred (whether through the senses or telepathically),\nso far as the process of transference takes place outside the percipient's\nordinary consciousness, or through being imperfectly externalised as a halluci\nnation, which hallucination is then wrongly interpreted by the percipient's\nconscious mind. Of such misinterpretations of hallucinations we have definite\ninstances, \u2014instances where the idea that was intended to be communicated\nto the hypnotised person was known, his description of the hallucination that\nwas produced by it heard, and also his conscious interpretation of that hallu\ncination. Compare, for instance, P.'s post-hypnotic hallucinations of a vague\nrhinocero-s when told to see a hippopotamus, of a figure which he called\n\" Buffalo Bill\" when he was told to see Robinson Crusoe, and of what he\ntook for the Mayor when he was told to see Macbeth, and other similar\ninstances, both with P. and T. as percipients, in Mr. Myers' experiments\n{Proceedings, S.P.R., Vol. VIII., pp. 459-462). Compare also P.'s appar\nently telepathically suggested hallucination of a choir-boy interpreted as a\nghost ( Proceedings, Vol. VIII., p. 565) and Miss. B.'s hallucination of a\nsailing-boat, of which the sails at first suggested chalk cliffs (Proceedings,\nVol. VIII, p. 561). For a spontaneous case of a somewhat similar process,\n\u2014a memory picture called up by association, but only afterwards recognised,\n\u2014see Proceedings, Vol. X., pp. 143-4. Of course, the indistinctness of a\nhallucination might be due either to indistinctness in the underlying idea,\nas in the hippopotamus case above, or to imperfect reproduction of it in the\nhallucination, as in one of Mr. Myers' experiments referred to above, when\nT. saw horses with little things on their backs, but failed to recognise the\nlittle things as monkeys. Whatever the cause, there is no doubt that the\nhallucinations of numbers often were indistinct.\nDrs. Lehmann and Hansen attempted to verify or disprove the\nhypothesis that this indistinctness may have been the immediate cause of the\nmisnaming of the numbers, by experiments in which they read numbers\nflashed rapidly before their eyes. The results are of some interest, but we\ndo not think the method affords any useful comparison with the kind of\nmisreading we have suggested, because the indistinct vision complained of by\nour percipients was seldom that due to a momentary sight of the object looked\nat, but rather that due to distance or want of definite outline, or partial\nblotting out of the object (hallucination) itself. The hallucination usually\npersisted long enough to be seen as well as it was capable of being seen.\nWe have discussed this subject of misinterpreted visual hallucinations at\nsome length, because what we said before seems to have been completely\nmisunderstood by Drs. Lehmann and Hansen. But though it is quite true\n(in our opinion at least) that more evidence is afforded by our experimental\nseries for errors of this kind than for errors arising from the misinterpre\ntation of unconscious whispering or counting, the evidence does not amount\nto much, and it is not increased or supported by our later experiments.\nA few words, before we conclude, about the observations of Drs. Lehmann\nand Hansen on thought-transference experiments, conducted by means of\ndrawings. Certainly their own experiments, a certain superficial plausibility\nnotwithstanding, were not very successful. They made fifteen attempts in\n\fSupplement.] Involuntary Whispering. 311\nwhich the agent\u2014 Dr. Hansen\u2014looked at a double number, and the\npercipient, Dr. Lehmann, drew the picture of it which arose in his mind.\nOf the results, six, comprising images of eleven separate numerals, at first\nseemed to them successful ; but afterwards they concluded that the resem\nblance was illusory. This second opinion I have no inclination to question :\nundoubtedly there is a curious vagueness about Dr. Lehmann's figures\nsuggesting deliberate ambiguity on the part of his subliminal consciousness ;\nand the moral drawn by him as to the need of caution in interpreting results\nof this kind is undeniably sound, and useful to beginners.\nBut when Dr. Lehmann tries to apply the moral to the experiments in\nthought-transference by means of drawings or diagrams recorded in our\nProceedings, he makes it evident that he has only given them a very partial\nand superficial consideration. Thus (1) he selects Professor Richet's experi\nments in clairvoyance for comment when the subject under discussion is\nthought-transference ; (2) he asserts sweepingly that the percipients were\nmost frequently hypnotised or hysterical : this being true of Professor\nRichet's percipients, but not true in the case of the thought-transference\nexperiments with drawings described in our Proceedings. In these, none of the\npercipients were hypnotised, and there is no reason to think that any of them,\nexcept some of those who assisted Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing, were hysterical.\nIn view of these palpable inaccuracies, his assertion that the agreement\nbetween original and reproduction in our experiments with drawings is\n\"usually\" not better than in Professor Richet's experiments, may be fairly\nset down to ignorance ; it is evident that he has never seen those given in\nVols. I. and II.\u2014Mr. Guthrie's experiments,\u2014or those in which Mr. Smith\nwas percipient and Mr. Blackburn agent : or, again, those conducted by Mr.\nRawson, and described in Vol. XI. This being so, his general conclusion\nthat the result of all the experiments hitherto carried on in thought-\ntransference in which the percipient expresses his thoughts in drawings can\nwithout difficulty be explained by two causes\u2014namely, accidental coincidence\nand illusory resemblance\u2014hardly deserves serious discussion. No one could\nassert this with regard to (e. g.) the six consecutive reproductions given in\nProceedings, Vol. II., pp. 33\u201435 (see also Phantasms of the Living, Vol. I. ,\npp. 35-51).\nWe have taken the trouble to examine and estimate all the experiments\nof this kind described in the Proceedings of the S.P.R., taking as a\nstandard those drawings which Colonel Taylor regards as resembling each\nother in his \"Experimental Comparison between Chance and Thought-\ntransference,\" Vol. VI., p. 398. Those which we estimate as successes,\nwe divide into three classes, as Colonel Taylor does. These classes are :\u2014\n1. Those which are alike in idea\u2014that is to say, have the kind of\nresemblance one would expect if the percipient knew the name of the\nobject the drawing represented, but had not seen the drawing. Instances\nof this are the hand in Mr. Rawson's experiments, Vol. XI., p. 4,\nand several others of his experiments,\u2014 or again, the cat in M. Schmoll's\nexperiments, No. 58, Vol. V., p. 180, when a rough sketch of a cat was\ndrawn by the agent and a cat's face seen by the percipient.\n2. Those which are alike in shape. All successful experiments with\nnameless diagrams come under this head, and so do some cases where the\n\f312 [Supplement.\nProfessor Henry Sidgwick.\nobject drawn has a name, but has not been recognised by the percipient.\nAn instance of this is No. 11 in Proceedings, Vol. I., p. 193, where a\nrough drawing of a horse's head is roughly reproduced, but not recognised.\n3. Those which are alike both in idea and shape. As, for instance,\nthe pig in Mr. Rawson's experiments, Vol. XI., p. 4 ; or the fish or the\nface in Mr. Guthrie's experiments, Vol. II., pp. 35 and 41. Simple\ngeometrical figures with names may, of course, easily come under this head.\nSee, for instance, some of Mr. Dessoir's experiments, Vol. V., pp. 355\u2014\n357. There are in all in the eleven volumes of the Proceedings 493\nexperiments with drawings described, or at least mentioned.1 Included in\nthe 493 are 24 cases in which it is stated that no impression was received\nby the percipient, and 40 experiments with Mr. Guthrie's percipients,\nperformed in sets of 6 or 7, under conditions known beforehand to be\nunfavourable, and which Mr. Guthrie thinks should not count.

Of course, as the reproductions are\nin no cases quite exact copies, various persons would estimate some of them\ndifferently, so that, though we have tried to maintain a certain standard, a\nmargin should be allowed for differences of opinion. We find, for instance,\nwhat had escaped our memory when we made our own estimate, that Colonel\nTaylor had made an estimate of the Smith and Blackburn drawings.\nWe count 16 successes, while he considers that there were only 13 successes\ncomparable to those in his chance series, and among these 13 he includes\n2 which we do not count in our 16. There are, therefore, 5 of the 16\nwhich he does not agree about. Let us assume that this is a normal\nproportion of disagreement, so that about a third of our 123 successful\ncases should be regarded as doubtful. Still we have 82, or about 17\nper cent, of successes to compare with Colonel Taylor's 2 per cent,\nby chance ; which last, moreover, would also probably be reduced if the\nsupposed coincidences were required to be approved independently by\nseveral persons. In our total, also, we have included and counted as\nfailures every experiment mentioned, but of which we have not a sufficient\naccount to enable us to estimate it for ourselves. There are probably cases\nwhere no impression was produced among these.\nBut this is not the whole strength of the case against chance in these\nexperiments. Those which we have not counted as successes are by no\nmeans all failures. There are intermediate classes showing varying degrees\nof resemblance to the original, or apparently representing part of the original\nonly. When, without being all good reproductions, a set of experiments is\nsuch that if the originals and reproductions were severally shuffled up, they\nwould be re-arranged in their proper pairs by a person seeing them for the\nfirst time, as is, for instance, the case with all or almost all the Blackburn\nand Smith series, this cannot be due to chance coincidence. Nor is it con\nceivable that series like Mr. Rawson's and Mr. Smith's of Leeds, or, as we\nhave already said, Mr. Guthrie's on some days, should be accidental.\nDr. Lehmann thinks that, to avoid vagueness or ambiguity, the originals\nin experiments of this kind should represent definite objects or figures with\nnames, which the percipient should be required to give. But supposing his\nown experiments in seeing numbers had been successful, would not he in\nthe light of his later experience have been the first to say that his success\nwas due to unconscious whispering by Dr. Hansen 1 It was to avoid the\npossibility of indications of this sort, conscious and unconscious, that the\nplan of trying to transfer nameless geometrical figures was adopted. In\nexperiments in clairvoyance like Professor Richet's, where the drawing to\nbe reproduced is unknown to all present, it would no doubt be desirable to\nuse very clear and definite figures which could be named ; as has been already\npointed out by Miss A. B. Balfour in a careful criticism of Professor Richet's\nresults (see S.P.R. Journal for December, 1888. Vol. III., p. 348). But in\nthought-transference experiments with agent and percipient in the same\nroom, there are obvious advantages in making some of the experiments with\nnameless figures. Nameless figures may, no doubt, be sometimes trans\nferred by unconscious movements appealing to the sense of touch, for which\nreason contact should be avoided ; but it is hard to conceive of their being\nconveyed by unconscious\u2014or, for that matter, even conscious\u2014auditory\n\f314 \"Professor Henry Sidgwich. [Supplement.\nindications. Nameless figures afford, too, the best evidence that form may\nbe transferred apart from any other qualities or associations ; and therefore,\ngranted the reality of thought-transference, constitute an important part of\nthe data for forming an idea of the nature of the process.\nTo sum up, we conclude that, interesting and instructive as the paper of\nDrs. Lehmann and Hansen is, and useful in giving practical illustrations of\ncertain dangers to be guarded against, they have not shown that either\nchance, illusion, or unconscious whispering will account for the evidence\nfor apparent thought-transference afforded by experiments in reproducing\ndrawings and guessing numbers, described in the Proceedings of the Society\nfor Psychical Research.\n\fSupplement.] 315\nInvoluntary Whispering.\nTABLES.\nTable A.\nMessrs.

W. H. Myers.\nn.\nRECENT EXPERIMENTS IN NORMAL MOTOR AUTOMATISM.\nBy F. W. H. Myeks.\nTwo articles of much interest to students of automatism have recently\nbeen published in the Psychological Review (Macmillan). In July, 1895,\nappeared a paper on \"Experimental Induction of Automatic Processes,\"\nby Professor Newbold, of Philadelphia\u2014a valued contributor to these\nProceedings. In September, 1896, among Studies from the Psychological\nLaboratory of Harvard University, appeared a paper on \"Normal Motor\nAutomatism,\" by Leon M. Solomons and Gertrude Stein, describing certain\nexperiments on the early stages of such automatism, conducted with a\ncare and ingenuity worthy of that distinguished psychological school.\nI purpose first briefly to point out the relation in which these papers\nstand to views previously set forth in these Proceedings, and then to pass\non to one or two reflections of wider scope, which the new experiments\nsuggest. In Vol. II., (Part VII., November, 1884), of these Proceedings,\nwill be found a paper \"On a Telepathic Explanation of Some So-called\nSpiritualistic Phenomena,\" in which I attempted a first imperfect analysis\nof certain motor phenomena which, until that time, had excited little or no\nattention, except from those who saw in all automatic writing the direct\naction of spirits of the dead. Dealing in that paper with the earlier and\nsimpler types of these phenomena, I there urged (pp. 222\u20146) that the\n\" graphic automatism of mental abstraction \" was often a normal and not a\nmorbid thing : ' ' simply an extension of the tricks of unconscious action,\nwhich to some extent are common to every one.\" Speaking of Greek words\n'' unconsciously scribbled on the edge of composition papers in the nervous\nness of examination,\" I said that \"in this case it is the strong concentration\nof the current of attention elsewhere, which allows the writing faculty to\nmanifest itself automatically,\u2014permits, that is to say, the unconscious\ncerebral action to discharge itself along the well-worn track which leads to\nthe formation of written words. \"\nIt is this view of the connection of motor automatism with normal\nprocesses which these newer writers strongly, and, as it seems to me,\nconvincingly support ;\u2014a fact the more interesting since I do not think,\njudging by internal evjdence, that my own paper\u2014written at a time when\nour Proceedings reached a smaller public than they now reach\u2014has fallen\nunder the notice of either author.\n\"I am now convinced,\" writes Professor Newbold, \"that in many\ncases the writing is produced precisely as these sensory processes are\nproduced\u2014by the continuous application of an indeterminate stimulus to the\nhighly organised writing mechanism.\" Precisely so ;\u2014and the previously\ncited instance of verse-composition, with mind fixed on the idea of writing,\nseems a good illustration of this \" indeterminate stimulus.\"\n\fSupplement.] Experiments in Motor Automatism. 317\nMr. Solomons' paper affords a confirmation,\u2014which, as I have said,\nshould be absolutely convincing for those who accept his account of himself\nand his collaboratrix as \"representatives of the perfectly normal, or perfectly\nordinary being, so far as hysteria is concerned, \"\u2014of a thesis which I have\nfrom the first urged as very important, but which has been called in question\nby high authorities (see Proceedings, Vol. VIII., pp. 470-472). I mean the\nthesis that there does exist a \"Normal Motor Automatism;\" that the\nso-called \" disaggregation of personality\" which produces automatic script\nmay be cultivated without injury (if proper care be taken) by perfectly\nhealthy persons of either sex. These two students taught themselves to read\naloud unconsciously, and to write from dictation unconsciously, to write\nwords of their own unconsciously\u2014to perform, in short, to perfection various\nautomatic tricks ;\u2014and yet at the end of (apparently) weeks of it they were\nnot a penny the worse,\u2014were even more scientific and even less hysterical\nthan when they began. Their paper should become a locus classicus on this\nimportant question of the cultivation of motor automatism by sound and\nnormal persons.\nThe task which they set themselves was an ingenious one. They aimed\nat reproducing, in a waking state of complete normality, \"the essential\nelements of the second personality, so far as they consist of definite motor\nreactions unaccompanied by consciousness,\" \"or,\" they politely add, \"shall we\nsay, out of deference to the subliminal consciousness theory, unaccompanied\nby conscious consciousness.\" \"These elements\" they continue, \"appeared\nto us to be conveniently considered under four groups, as follows :\u2014\n\" 1. General tendency to movement without conscious motor impulse.\n\" 2. Tendency of an idea in the mind to go over into a movement in\nvoluntarily and unconsciously.\n\" 3. Tendency of a sensory current to pass over into a motor reaction\nsub-consciously.\n\" 4. Unconscious exercise of memory and invention.\"\nThe first three of these elements they exemplified with great distinctness.\nThey approximated, probably more nearly than waking experiments have\never done, to those phenomena of dissociation of the writing and the reading\nprocesses, and of either of these from normal memory, on which Mr. Edmund\nGurney recorded so many experiments in his papers on \"Peculiarities of\nCertain Post-hypnotic States,\" and \"Stages of Hypnotic Memory,\" (Pro\nceedings, Vol. IV., p. 268 and p. 515.) And in the course of these\nexperiments\u2014not being hypnotised, but alert and accurate\u2014they made\nobservations well worth study on the fluctuations of attention and con\nsciousness.\nAs to the fourth element\u2014\"unconscious exercise of memory and inven\ntion \"\u2014they were perhaps less successful. Their best \" writing from\ninvention\" seems to have consisted in the following sentence,\u2014described\n(somewhat euphemistically) by Mr. Solomons as \" more poetical than\nintelligible \" ;\u2014 When he co\\dd not be the longest and thus to be, and thus to be\nthe strongest. Perhaps if their poetry had been stronger their paper would\nhave been longer.\n\"That the second personality,\" says Mr. Solomons after summing up his\nmain results, '' shows, in general, no abilities beyond this, will, I think,\n\f318 [Supplement.\nF. W. H. Myers.\ngenerally be admitted.\" I certainly admit, and have often asserted, that the\nbulk of automatic messages,\u2014including the first scrawls of a planchette, and\nthe first tiltings of a table,\u2014are much on this level. But certainly neither\nProfessor Janet, (to whom I think allusion is made) nor myself ever regarded\nutterances of this type as indications of the formation of a secondary\npersonality. They are, as I have frequently said, precisely parallel to the\nscrappy words which float through one's mind in a moment's doze. A new\npersonality is no more formed in the self by these little spurts of fragmentary\nindependence than a new party is formed in the House of Commons whenever\nan honourable member cries \" Oh ! oh ! \"\nThe formation of a new personality, as of a new party, depends upon the\nnumber of psychical or parliamentary units which cohere, and the length of\ntime for which they remain coherent. It may range from an ideefixe\u2014which\nis a mere knot of fanatics\u2014to a coalition which overturns the government,\nas when Felida X.'s second personality dethroned her first. It is often a\nquestion of words at what point the term should be first applied\u2014what\ndegree of independent, intercurrent, persistent memory, altered faculty and\ndiathesis, is needed to make one feel that here is a true psychical\ndimorphism, a second mould into which the plastic life of the intelligence\nmight equally well have run.\nThe experimenters of whom I have been speaking here paused just\nbeyond the threshold of the enquiry. The true, the important difficulty of\nclassification occurs (as Professor Newbold, at any rate, knows well) at a\nlater stage altogether. It occurs when the intruding type represents no\nlonger a partition merely, or an allotropism, but something superadded and\nsupernormal, something which seems to lie beyond the native scheme and\nscope of man. There is the point where previous beliefs or disbeliefs are\nrudely tested. In the case of Mrs. Piper's trances, for instance,\u2014nay, in\ncases which in strangeness fall far short of hers,\u2014we may some day see the\nconservative critic driven to cling to this very hypothesis of secondary\npersonalities ;\u2014to stretch to breaking-point the conception of a subliminal\nself. For what else would have to be admitted would be more perturbing\nstill.\nProblems such as these should be slowly and carefully approached. In\nthe mean time there is a real satisfaction in the thought that the younger\ngeneration of experimental psychologists are entering upon a line of\ninvestigation from which some of them, I doubt not, are destined some day\nto reap a rich reward of discovery. Only let them follow fearlessly wherever\ntruth may lead, and beware of preconstructing from too few factors their\nformula for the Sum of Things.\n\fSupplement.] 319\nReviews.\nIII.\nREVIEWS.\nPredvestniki Spiritizma za poslednie 250 lyet. (The Precursors of Spiritism\nfor the last 250 years.) By A. M. Aksakoff, St. Petersburg, 1895.\nIt is perhaps hardly fair to quote Mr. AksakofFs title without his\nsub-title. He must now be almost, if not quite, the doyen of Continental\nSpiritists, and no man is better qualified to write a history of the\nmovement, and at the first glance we might hope to have such a history\nhere. To prevent disappointment, therefore, it is well to say at once\nthat he does not profess to give more than ' ' Published Cases of Spontaneous\nMedianic Phenomena from the year 1661, and the transition to Experi-\nmentalism in 1848.\"\nIt follows that much of the present work is but a translation into\nRussian of cases with which the English student is familiar. We need not\ndeal here with Glanville or the Wesleys, with Tedworth or Hydesville, nor\neven with the recent report of the Continental observers of Eusapia. But\ntwo of the cases recorded, though previously published in one form or\nanother, are inaccessible to western readers, and for different reasons deserve\nto be made more widely known.\nThe first occurred in a small Russian village, and, by the happy accident\nthat it resulted in damage to Government property, became the subject of\nan official enquiry of an obviously unprejudiced character. Mr. Aksakoff\nhas published verbatim, without comment, the whole of the official papers,\nincluding the depositions of all the witnesses. From these I have compiled\na connected narrative. The other case does not enjoy this almost unique\n\" objectivity \" of record ; but the facts stated are certainly among the most\nremarkable of their class, and, in spite of obvious deficiencies in the\ntestimony, are sufficiently in analogy with other cases to deserve attention.\nIn January, 1853, a small cavalry post (\u00a3tape) at the hamlet of Liptsy,\nin the Government of Kharkoff, was commanded by a Captain Jandachenko,\nwho, with his wife, lived in a small four-roomed house, which had been\ntaken by the village community for his official residence. It had previously\nbelonged to peasants, in whose time nothing abnormal had occurred in it.\nIt seems, indeed, that in the beginning of January, 1852, something\nmysterious had happened there, but, as this is only casually alluded to by\none of the witnesses, we must pass on a year, to January 9th, 1853,\nwhen the present history opens.\nOn that day it appears that the house was occupied by Captain Janda\nchenko and his wife, who had a bedroom and sitting-room on one side of\nthe passage ; on the other side was a store-room and the kitchen, in which\nthe servants also slept. On this evening there were five of them, two maids\nnamed Efimia and Matrona, the latter hired, the former a serf of the\ny\n\f320 [Supplement.\nWalter Leaf.\ncaptain's, and three soldiers, one of them, Vasili (Basil), being the captain's\norderly, and the other two attached to him temporarily.\nAfter the servants had put out the light, but before they had gone to\nsleep\u2014such is the account which they give without variations\u2014sundry\nsmall objects, such as cups and wooden platters standing on the stove, were\nthrown about the room. A light was struck, but the throwing continued\nwhen no one was looking, and no cause could be found for it. Next day,\nthe 5th, Captain Jandachenko mentioned this to his parish priest, Victor\nSelyezneff, who came with his church officers on the 6th, the Epiphany,1\nafter the ceremony of blessing the water in the river. \"On entering the\nhouse,\" he says, \" I saw a small stone fall in the passage ; a cup full of\ndumplings fell at my feet in the midst of the attendants who were carrying\nthe icons, and I heard repeated knocks.\" Captain Jandachenko adds that\nafter the house had been sprinkled with holy water\u2014the object of the\npriest's visit\u2014 \" an axe was thrown from the loft in the passage against the\ndoors with remarkable velocity and noise.\" Another priest, Father\nLobkovsky, whose curiosity had been aroused by what he had been told\nduring the blessing of the river, was also present, with several other official\nvisitors to the captain. They went into the kitchen, when, '' in the sight of\nall of us, there was smashed against the door in the passage, where no human\nbeing was, a bottle of varnish, which, according to the captain, had been\nstanding in the sitting-room cupboard under lock and key.\" Moreover, a\nsoldier reported\u2014though this, as we know, is \"not evidence\"\u2014that a tub\nfull of vegetables in the cellar had left its place and upset its contents.\nUndaunted by the small success of the aspersion, the good priests\nbrought the heavy artillery of the church into play next day. With the\nassistance of a third father, of the church officials and the icons, a solemn\nservice was read. Hardly had they begun, when a stone was thrown in the\nkitchen, which was empty, and smashed a window in the sight of all. Then\na piece of wood, followed by a pail of water, flew out of the kitchen into\nthe midst of the assembly, the latter upsetting in the midst. The culminating\nhorror was the fall of a stone into the basin of holy water itself. The house\nwas again thoroughly sprinkled, and the holy objects carried back to the\nchurch ; but as the phenomena still continued, the captain begged two of\nthe priests to return and read the formal prayers for the exorcism of evil\nspirits.\nThis seems to have had little more effect than the previous service. The\nphenomena continued in the presence of several fresh witnesses, and on the\n8th took a new turn. The bed in the room of the captain and his wife\ncaught fire in the presence of both ; they put it out, but it immediately\nblazed out in a fresh place, and had to be again extinguished. At the same\ntime two blows were struck on the window by a brick, and four panes of\nglass broken. Captain Jandachenko was at last driven to change his\nquarters, but moved back after a few days. At the same time he again had\nrecourse to the services of a priest, which for the time were successful,\n1 There seems to be some discrepancy in the evidence here ; the Captain seems to\nsay that the priest's first visit was on the 5th, while Father Selyeznen\" himself says\nthat he did not go before the 6th.\n\fSupplement.] 321\nReviews.\nas the phenomena were now reduced to nothing worse than some ' ' human\ngroaning \" of a most doleful description, heard by the servants in the\nkitchen.\nBut after a few days it all began again ; and on January 22nd Captain\nJandachenko brought some friends in to witness what was going on. On\nthis occasion the orderly, Vasily, was slightly wounded in the head by a\nknjfe thrown by the evil agency. Things grew worse and worse, and a\nnumber of peasants were brought into the house to watch : but, in spite of\nall care, next afternoon (the 23rd) the roof of the house caught fire and was\nburnt off, the efforts of the firemen being much hindered by a peculiarly\nthick and malodorous smoke blown in their faces. This led to an inquiry\nby the local ' ' ispravnik \" (head of the district police), which took place on\nFebruary 4th and 5th.\nThe evil spirits yielded for a time to government interference ; and\nthough, as appears from the very full report of the evidence, nothing was\nfound to direct suspicion against any one, all was quiet for some months.\nCaptain Jandachenko had in the meantime permanently removed to another\nhouse, and here, on July 23rd, the old games began once more. In one\nroom the pillows were thrown off the beds, in another jars of water were\nupset The captain at once applied officially for help, and again a guard of\npeasants was set all about the house. In vain ; things were more lively\nthan ever through the 24th, and in the morning of the 25th the most\nserious troubles of all began. At eight o'clock the thatched roof was\nsuddenly found to be on fire. It was extinguished before the fire-engine\ncame, but for precaution engine and firemen were kept on the spot. At\nthree o'clock in the afternoon thick smoke was seen coming from a shed in a\nwing of the house. A soldier crawled in on hands and knees, and dragged\nout a hay mattress full of smouldering fire, which was put out. Finally, at\nfive o'clock a sudden gust of wind arose, and with it the whole roof of the\nwing burst into flames. The fire spread so rapidly that the men not only\ncould not start the engine, but had great difficulty in dragging it into a place\nof safety ; and with the captain's house four neighbouring cottages were\ncompletely burnt to the ground.\nThis serious damage of course led to a renewed enquiry, in the course of\nwhich most of the inhabitants of the village as well as of the house seem to\nhave been examined. This lasted for five days, from July 27th to 31st,\nafter which, no result having been arrived at, the matter was transferred to\nthe civil court at Kharkoff, where it was duly pigeon-holed. It was only\nafter repeated enquiries, and at last after vigorous representations from\nheadquarters, that the final inquiry was held in July 1856, three years after\nthe events. The evidence previously given was duly recapitulated, and the\nonly decision given was to the effect that there was no suspicion to be traced\nagainst any one. There the matter was left till Mr. Aksakoff published the\ndocuments in extenso.\nNaturally the enquiry is more remarkable for impartiality than for\nintelligence. It was recognised that the kitchen was always the focus of\nthe \" evil force, \" but so little effort was made to connect the phenomena\nwith any particular person that it is very difficult, often impossible, in spite\nof the voluminous depositions, to discover exactly who was present on any\n\f322 [Supplement.\nWalter Leaf.\nparticular occasion. The evidence of the captain's wife, an important\nwitness, one would think, seems never to have been taken. With a some\nwhat wider experience of similar cases, we naturally look at once to the\nservant maid Efimia. She, at least, was in the house during both periods of\nactivity, which the other maid, Matrona, apparently was not. The orderly,\nVasily, may have had his share ; it is remarkable that the second outburst\nin July exactly coincided with his return to the house after a spell in\nhospital. But he came only for a day or two, and reported himself again in\nKharkoff on the 24th, the day before the three fires, with which, therefore,\nhe can have had no direct concern ; the fact that he was wounded on\nthe first occasion can hardly be said to tell one way more than the other.\nHowever, if Efimia was the actual criminal, she must have attained a\ncreditable degree of skill to carry on her mystifications in daylight, often\nunder the eyes of a whole crowd of people, without arousing the least trace\nof suspicion in the breast of a Russian police officer.\nThe second case to which I have referred is one of a more complicated\nand startling sort. It was never subjected to a similar enquiry, but on the\nother hand it had the advantage of investigation during a considerable period\nby apparently intelligent sceptics ; and it is somewhat less remote in time, so\nthat Mr. Aksakoff has been able to make enquiries and give information as\nto the credibility of the witness on whose evidence the phenomena are given.\nThe whole story appears to have been widely known in Eastern Russia at\nthe time of the occurrences, and was warmly discussed in the local papers.\nThe narrative is given in the words of Mr. Shchapoff, a country gentleman\nliving in a house some 20 miles from Iletski, in the government of Uralsk,\nnot far from Orenburg. In the following I give a much compressed outline,\nas far as possible in his own words :\u2014\n\" On November 16th, 1870,\" says Mr. Shchapoff, \"I returned to my\nhouse from Iletski, a town some 30 versts away. My household consisted\nof my mother and mother-in-law, two ladies each aged about 69, my wife, a\nlittle over 20, and our infant daughter. My wife at once told me that they\nhad had no sleep for two nights on account of certain strange disturbances.\nI was at first inclined to laugh, till I found that my wife was in earnest, and\nheard from her the following narrative.\n\" On the night of the 14th the infant had been peevish, and in order to\nquiet her, our cook Maria had been sent for to play the harmonica and\ndance to her. This sent the child to sleep. My wife then sat with a\nneighbour, the miller's wife, and was chatting with her, when the latter\nsuddenly started up in alarm, but immediately begged my wife not to be\nafraid, explaining that she had suddenly fancied that some one was passing\nthe window. Presently they both saw a shadow flitting past outside, and\nwere about to go out to see what it was, when they heard in the loft over\ntheir heads the sound of dancing, exactly similar to that of Maria, and\nclearly recognisable by the characteristic rhythm of a difficult ' three-footed '\n(double-shuffle ? ) figure which she had been performing. They thought\nthat Maria was practising, till they found her asleep in the kitchen, the steps\noverhead still continuing. The girl immediately took a light and searched\nthe loft, but without result. Meanwhile the two ladies heard loud raps on\nthe window panes. They got the miller and the gardener to look round the\n\fSupplement.] 323\nReviews.\nhouse ; but nothing was found, and during the search both the raps on the\nwindow and the dancing overhead continued till morning and kept the house\nawake. Precisely the same thing began at ten o'clock the next evening, in\nspite of a thorough search of house and ground by the whole force of\ndomestics and neighbours.\n' ' I saw the miller, who confirmed this account, but added that he had\nfound under the cornice and cleared away a pigeon's nest, which he thought\nmight be the cause of the noises. I was satisfied by this explanation, and\ngave my wife a lecture on her superstition, put the whole thing out of\nmy head, and sat down after tea to read Livingstone's Travels in Africa.\nThrough the glazed doors which separated our rooms I heard my wife and\nchild go to bed. All was quiet ; I read with interest for some two\nhours, when I heard, as though from the ceiling, a sort of vague scratching.\nI thought the dog had got into the loft, when presently the sound changed\nto the unmistakable \" three-time\" of the dance. It ceased and began again ;\nI could distinctly localise the place in the ceiling, over my wife's bed. As I\nlistened, trying to understand, I heard a rap on the window of my wife's\nroom, a dull rap, as though with the flesh of the finger on the window frame.\nAfter a few seconds the rap became clear, like the sound of a finger-nail on\nthe pane. I went to look through the glazed door of my wife's bedroom, and\nsuv by the night-lamp that she was fast asleep in bed. Just then came\nanother rap, much louder, as though impatient ; it awoke my wife, who looked\nabout her, and asked me if I heard. In reply I asked her if she had not\nbeen rapping. As though in answer to my question, there came a rap on the\nwindow beside my own bed. I rushed to it, and looked out into the yard,\nwhich was brilliantly lighted by the moon. I could see no one. I concealed\nmyself behind the window, and held my breath, hoping thus to catch the\noffender ; suddenly two deafening blows were dealt the outer wall close to my\near, so violent that the house shook as though with an earthquake. I\ninvoluntarily jumped away, my wife called out \" There ! It has begun\nagain ! \" and began to pray. I took my great-coat and gun, sent the cook\nfor the gardener, went out, and called the dogs. Neither they nor I could\nfind any traces, though the night was as clear as day, and perfectly still.\nThere were no marks on the snow beneath the windows where the raps\nhad been heard. While we were outside we distinctly heard blows on wall\nand window ; when we returned with empty hands, those who were in the\nhouse asked us if we had not been making the noise from without. All this\ntime the scratching and dancing over our heads continued. We searched the\nloft with lamps and lanterns ; while we were in it not a sound was heard, but\nas soon as we returned to the room beneath the noises began again.\n\" After a sleepless night we spent the day in a thorough search of the loft ;\nall in vain. When the night came, things were worse rather than better.\nThe house was crowded with neighbours, yet the sounds on windows and\nwalls went on very loudly, resembling in character the beating of a drum.\nOther phenomena occurred, for instance a loud dull noise in the passage, as\nthough a heavy sack of flour had been thrown down from the loft. We\nrushed, out to see what had happened, and had hardly closed the door behind\nus when it received such a violent blow that the solidity of the hinges\nseemed to be severely tried. In neither case could we find any cause.\n\f324 [Supplement.\nWalter Leaf.\n' ' Next day the phenomena were much less violent, and in a day or two\nthey ceased entirely. I spoke to my friends about them, and during a visit\nfrom one of them some weeks later, on December 20th, we determined to try\nan experiment by getting Maria to repeat the dance with which all had\nbegun on the former occasion. To our surprise, as soon as she had gone\nthrough a few turns of the dance, raps began on the window-pane. They\nconfined themselves to rapping out the rhythm of the seven bars of the\ndance, finishing each time with two or three louder blows. This ceased at\nmidnight. Next night the raps began without any preliminary dancing at\nall, combined with a strange dull sound which we agreed came from the\nchimney of the stove. Then objects lying on the ground, such as boots and\nslippers, began to fly through the air, up to the ceiling, or against walls or\ndoors ; they were sometimes observed to give a sort of hiss as they flew.\nBut the strangest thing was that when they fell on the felt-covered floor,\nthey made a sound which did not belong to them ; for instance a piece of\nstuff from the bedclothes fell with a sound like a hard heavy body, whereas\nhard bodies fell with no sound at all. The phenomena grew gradually weaker\nand then ceased.\n\" Ten days later we had a party of friends to see in the new year, 1871, and\nrepeated the experiment of asking Maria to dance. We heard nothing till\npast twelve and were going to bed, when the drumming began, and grew\nlouder and louder on the window-pane of my wife's room, then on the walls,\netc., as before. We set ourselves to observe ; those who were outside the\nhouse heard the noise from inside, and vice versa. The raps then transferred\nthemselves to the glazed door of my wife's room, up and down which they\nran, now in small shrill shakes, now louder and more measured. At times\nwe heard vague deep vocal sounds which made us turn to one another and\nsay, ' Did you do that ? ' and then laugh at our involuntary suspicions.\n\" The phenomena now continued without our attempting to produce them\nby the dance. On January 8th my wife fainted on seeing a ball of light\nfloat from under her bed, small at first, but growing to the size of an india-\nrubber ball as big as a soup-plate. Next day the raps began in the day-time,\nat 3 p.m., when she had lain down to sleep, and from this time they\nfollowed her everywhere as she walked about the room. This development\ntroubled us both greatly, and alarmed us as to her health ; for though she\nwas not particularly afraid of the phenomena, she always felt a peculiar\nweakness when they began, with a strong tendency to sleep. We decided\ntherefore to go for a month to my town-house. But the first person we met\nin town was my friend, Dr. Shustoff, who on hearing my account at once\nexplained that the phenomena were due to electric or magnetic force, arising\nfrom some peculiarity either in the soil beneath our house or, possibly, in\nmy wife's organism. This not very lucid explanation was enough to cheer\nour unlearned minds, and we decided to return to the country with the\ndoctor for a night at least. We did so, and set Maria to dance. The\nphenomena occurred, though only faintly ; but he was able to hear raps on\nmy wife's bedroom window while she was visibly asleep on the other side of\nthe room. The doctor again expounded his theory of electricity, and we\nwere relieved to think that we could put out of our heads the tormenting\nidea of evil spirits. Even my mother, who had hitherto been praying and\n\fSupplement.] 325\nReviews.\ncrossing herself without producing any visible effect on the phenomena, felt\nthat she could breathe again. Still we decided to carry out our intention of\nstaying a time in town. The servants told us that nothing happened during\nour absence. On one occasion I went there with a friend, and set Maria to\ndance, but not a sound resulted.\n\" We returned on January 21st. Hardly had my wife gone to bed when\nthe raps recommenced and things began to fly about\u2014dangerous things now,\ne.g., a table-knife was hurled violently against the door. This continued in\nspite of the care with which we shut up all such objects ; knives and forks\nwhich had been put into a closed cupboard in the evening used sometimes to\nfly about at midnight, and some were found sticking in the wall by our bed.\nWe were now thoroughly alarmed, and I was grateful for the visits of friends\nwho came out of curiosity to stay with us.\n'' The doctor's theory of electricity had finally to be given up on January\n24th. That night a visitor, Mr. Alekseeff, was sitting talking to my wife,\nand I was carrying the baby and singing to it. When I stopped singing the\nother two asked me to go on with the tune ; then they asked me to change\nit ; I did so, and then for the first time noticed that the raps on the window\nwere beating time to me. Mr. Alekseeff began to sing ; the invisible fingers\nbeat time to every tune, going astray only when he purposely made a sudden\nchange in tune and rhythm. We then tried singing in a whisper\u2014 the\nwhisper was reduced to a mere movement of the lips\u2014finally the tune was\nrepeated only mentally ; yet the raps kept time with perfect accuracy. The\nforce was gifted not only with hearing and understanding, but with the\npower of divination. We got my wife to move to a bed close to the glazed\ndoor ; the change was followed by a perfect torrent of raps on the glass.\nWe then found that the force would rap as many times as any of us either\nrapped out on the glass or silently willed. My mother now suggested that\nwe should chant the Lord's Prayer ; there was not a rap to be heard beyond\na sort of chord at the end. Thinking that the chant was perhaps not lively\nenough, I tried the Easter Hymn ; again not a sound ! My friend sang a\nsecular tune, which was immediately accompanied with embellishments !\nJust then our Tartar servant entered the room, and we asked him to chant\nhis prayer. Silence at once. We told him to say it faster, but however\nquickly he gabbled his ' Allah bismillah ' there was not a rap in answer.\nBut when I tried to imitate his tone in singing the invocation to the spirits\nfrom the Freischdtz, every bar called forth particularly loud raps.\n\"I then began to put questions. 'Are you a man?' Silence. 'A\nspirit?' One rap. ' What sort of spirit ? Good?' No answer. 'Evil?'\nTwo loud raps. ' What is your name?' And I went through all the names\nof good spirits I could think of without getting a reply. But when I came\nto the general name of the Power of Evil, and hesitated before pronouncing\nit, the raps began as though trying to utter what I had on the tip of my\ntongue ; and as I spoke the word ' Devil ? ' there came such a deafening\nblow, as though from the whole substance of the door, that we all involun\ntarily jumped backwards.\n\"I then asked why a spirit should behave thus to me, and in reply to\nvarious questions was told that it was ' set on at me. ' I asked who had\ndone it, and after going through many names was told that it was the servant\n\f326 [Supplement.\nWalter Leaf.\nof a neigbouring miller with whom I was at the time engaged in a law-suit\nabout my mill-pond. (I may mention that some time before I had met this\nvery man, who asked me about the disturbances, and said, with a peculiar\nmaliciousness and confidence, ' It will be worse than that ; they will drag\nyou by the hair. ' One day I found my wife in tears, and asked her what it\nwas. ' They will not let me sleep,' she said, ' they have been pulling my hair.')\n\" At this time the Orenburg section of the Imperial Geographical Society,\nhaving heard of the manifestations, asked me for an account, particularly of\nthe meteorological phenomenon of the ball of fire. After drawing it up I\ntook the opportunity of sending a copy to Dr. Shustoff, the author of the\nelectrical theory, asking him what he now thought. To my surprise and\nsatisfaction, this letter was answered by a visit from the doctor himself with\ntwo friends, Mr. Akutin, a civil engineer employed on government work, and\nMr. Savicheff, a local man of letters and poet, editor of the Uralsk Military\nGazette. The three presented themselves merely as interested enquirers,\nthough it subsequently appeared that they had been officially appointed a\ncommittee of enquiry by General Verevkin, governor of the province. I\nplaced my house and family entirely at their disposal, and they began with a\nstrict examination of the rooms. The manifestations, which had ceased for\na time, began again on the first evening of their visit, with raps, flying\nobjects, etc. Next morning they set up the apparatus they had brought with\nthem, breaking up part of the floor of my wife's bedroom in order to plant\nan iron rod in the soil beneath ; the other point of it was directed towards\nthe glazed door, the glass of which they covered with tinfoil. They brought\nalso a Leyden jar, magnets, and other instruments ; but I may say at once\nthat none of the apparatus threw any light whatever on the causes of the\nphenomena. A detailed journal of observations was kept, and we took turns\nto watch in my wife's room, whence the chief phenomena seemed to proceed.\n\" Our first aim was to establish some sort of system in the phenomena ;\nbut they, on the other hand, seemed to take pleasure in deceiving us. Thus\nquite at the beginning, as we were sitting at tea, the tea-things began to fly\naway in straight lines from my wife. As soon as we thought we had\nestablished the fact of some sort of repulsive power in her, she went to the\nsideboard and opened the door ; the things inside began to fly towards\nand past her. However we watched, we never saw anything at the moment\nof starting, but always when flying or falling. 1 We got my wife to touch the\nthings in the cupboard in turn ; none of them moved, but while we were all\nwatching them, something at the other end of the room, a candlestick or\nladle, would come flying past and fall near us.\n\"This continued for several days, till things took a new turn. One\nevening Akutin, who was in sentry duty in my wife's room, suddenly called\nto us to come in. He told us that he had been listening to some indefinite\nrustlings on the bed, where my wife was fast asleep, and it had occurred to\nhim to make a slight scratching with his own nails on the silk coverlet.\nThis had been immediately replied to by a similar scratching. He repeated\nthe experiment in our presence. The result was as he had described ; the\nsound he made was repeated at once and at the same spot. The experiment\n1 Compare Mr. Bristow's case in Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VII., p. 389.\n\fSupplement.] 327\nReviews.\nwas varied ; a definite number of sounds were made of different intensity,\non coverlet, pillow, bedstead or chair ; they were always repeated exactly and\nat the same spot. Akutin then asked which of us had made the sounds, and\nas he went through our names the same rustling sound invariably indicated\nthe person who had in fact made the sound. Needless to say that all this\ntime we kept my wife carefully under observation ; she was lying with her\nhead turned away, so that she could not look at us to see who was doing it.\n' ' Akutin was silent and disturbed for a time. He then began to ask\nquestions on such things as literature and politics, for instance about the\nevents of the Franco-German war, which was then going on. He invariably\nreceived correct answers, such as could not have been given by my wife,\nwho took no interest in political matters, and never read the papers, which,\nindeed, we were not taking in. Purposely misleading questions were\nreceived with obstinate silence. Akutin continued to ask in French and\nGerman, languages unknown to most of those present. The result was just\nthe same ; the answers were always correct. Akutin went on to ask about\nthe future ; which side would win ? The answer was, the French, and\nGambetta would be President. Among other things we were told that the\nSocialist Lassalle was alive. I thought he was dead, and exclaimed, ' What\nnonsense ! ' but Akutin corrected my mistake. He asked to be left alone,\nand did not go to bed, passing the night in deep meditation. Next morning,\nat breakfast, he turned the conversation on to poiitics, and convinced himself\nthat my wife hardly knew of the existence of the war, and was utterly\nignorant of its details. As for Lassalle and the rest, she had married young,\nand her mind was entirely occupied with the nursery and housekeeping.\n\" Akutin now asked us to move to our town house in Iletski for further\nobservations. Here the phenomena were much weaker ; the raps, for\ninstance, were only heard in the immediate neighbourhood of my wife. Two\nlocal physicians were called in to observe. One of them, especially, a\nGerman, Dubinsky by name, was completely sceptical. He first declared\nthat my wife made the raps by clicking her tongue, and made her hold it\nout. The raps ceased for a moment and began again. It was now asserted\nthat ' it was only the beating of her pulse, and nothing more ! ' When\nAkutin declared his intention of publishing the facts, Dr. Dubinsky attacked\nhim vehemently, and declared that he would compromise himself to no\npurpose, that the whole thing was trickery, and that all similar inquiries\nhad always ended in a fiasco. This evidently produced an effect upon Akutin,\nand made him waver. He called upon us to return at once to the countryhouse,\nwhere I regret to say that he had recourse to means not the most honour\nable. He bribed a servant boy to say that his mistress made the sounds\nherself, and then pretended that he had caught her trying to deceive us by\nthrowing things. He declared, therefore, that Dubinsky was right, and that\nhe would give such a turn to his report as would not lead to any con\nsequences ; but that he was convinced we were victims of a mystification on\nmy wife's part, owing to some morbid tendency for which she ought to be\nput under medical treatment.\n\" We accordingly placed her in the hands of Dr. Dubinsky; her health\nand spirits improved, the phenomena ceased, and we should have been quite\nhappy but for two annoyances. First, the appearance of an article in the\n\f328 [Supplement.\nWalter Leaf.\nUralsk Military Gazette, signed by the three members of the commission, to\nsay that the marvels at my country house were all the work of human hands ;\nand, secondly, a letter from the governor of the province, warning me that,\nas it had been reported that all the manifestations were susceptible of a\nperfectly natural explanation, such ' tricks ' were not to occur again, and\nreminding me of the serious legal penalties for the dissemination of\nsuperstition.\n\"Imagine, then, our horror when, on our return to the country in March,\nthe unknown force at once set to work again. And now even my wife's\npresence was not essential. Thus, one day I saw with my own eyes a heavy\nsofa jump off all its four legs, and this while my aged mother was lying on it\n\u2014to her terrible alarm, I need not say. This was particularly startling to\nme, as hitherto I had hardly dared to trust my own eyes ; I had always been\nwith others who might have influenced me. But this took place in full\ndaylight, there was no one present but my mother and myself, and a servant\nin the antechamber ; and I clearly saw the heavy sofa, with my mother lying\non it, rise three or four times clean off its legs.\n\" In the evening of the same or the next day, as we were in the sitting-\nroom, there flew out from a wash-stand in the antechamber, in the sight of\nus all, a bluish phosphorescent spark, with a crackling noise. It went towards\nmy wife's room, though she was not there ; and simultaneously we saw some\nthing flame up inside. I rushed in and saw a cotton dress, only partly made\nup, burning on a table in a corner. My mother-in-law, who was alone in the\nroom, anticipated me in extinguishing the fire with a jug of water. Before\nadmitting any one, I made a careful investigation, and found no explanation\nwhatever of the fire, other than the spark we had seen. There was a strong\nsmell of sulphur in the room, proceeding apparently from the dress, the burnt\nportions of which were still hot to the touch, and steamed as though the\nwater had been poured on hot iron instead of on calico.\n'' Though reluctant to leave my family alone at such a time, I was called to\nthe town by unavoidable business, and therefore asked a young neighbour,\nMr. Portnoff-, to come and keep them company in my absence. When I came\nback the day after, I found the whole household on the point of leaving, and\nthe luggage outside the house ; they said it was impossible to stay there any\nlonger, as things had begun to take fire of themselves, and the previous\nevening it had come to a spontaneous combustion of my wife's dress, in\nendeavouring to extinguish which Mr. Portnoff had burnt his hands badly.\nMr. Portnoff, whose hands were covered with blisters, gave me the' following\naccount. On the evening of my departure the phenomena had begun with\nbright meteors,which appeared dancing in the verandah, in front of the sitting-\nroom window. There were several of them, varying in size from a large\napple to a walnut. Their shape was round, their colour deep red or\nbluish pink ; they were not quite transparent, but rather dull. This\ncurious dance continued for some time ; it seemed as though the globes were\ntrying to get in at the window. My wife was not asleep at the time.\n\" Next evening they went to sit in the verandah, the weather being warm.\nPortnoff returned for a moment to the house and found the bed on fire. He\ncalled for help, and the bedding, which was well aflame, was put out, and a\ncareful search was made for any remains of fire. They had again taken\n\fSupplement.] 329\nReviews.\ntheir seats in the verandah, and were wondering what the source of the fire\ncould be, as no matches had been lighted in the room, nor were there any\ncigarette smokers in the house, when they again smelt burning. This time\nthey found the horse-hair mattress on tire from its underside. The fire had\npenetrated so far that in their opinion it could not have come from any\nsparks previously overlooked ; the more so as the very uninflammable\nmaterial contained no admixture of anything else.\n' ' But this was not all ; the catastrophe was still to come which decided us\nto leave the house at once, in spite of the inundations of the melting snows.\nI give it in Portnoffs own words. ' I was sitting playing the guitar. The\nmiller, who had been with us, got up to leave, and was followed by Helena\nEfimovna (Mrs. Shchapoff). Hardly had she shut the door behind her when\nI heard, as though from far off, a long deep-drawn wail. The voice seemed\nfamiliar to me ; overcome with an unaccountable horror I rushed to the\ndoor, and there in the passage I saw a literal pillar of fire, in the middle of\nwhich, draped in flame, stood Helena Efimovna ; the lower portion of her\ndress was on fire, and the flames almost concealed her. I supposed that the\nfire was not violent, as her dress was quite a thin one, and rushed to put it\nout with my hands ; but I found it burnt them badly, as though they were\nsticking to burning pitch. A sort of cracking noise came from beneath the\nfloor, which also shook and vibrated violently. The miller came back from\nwithout to help, and between us we carried off the unconscious victim in her\nburnt dress.'\n\" My wife's account was that as soon as she passed through the door into\nthe passage the floor shook beneath her, there came a deafening noise, and at\nthe same moment one of the bluish sparks, which we had previously seen\ncome from the cupboard, flew up from below ; she just had time to cry out in\nterror, when she found herself wrapped in fire, and lost consciousness. It\nis remarkable that she was not in the least burnt, though the thin dress she\nwas wearing was burnt all round higher than the knees, nor was there any\nsign of fire on her legs.\n' ' The miller's account was that he had left the house and was walking\nthrough the garden, when he heard first a noise and then a cry, and turning\nround saw there was fire in the passage. He was so frightened that his feet\ncould hardly carry him to render help.\n\" After this there was nothing for it but to run away. We took refuge at\nthe neighbouring hamlet in a Cossack's hut till the floods subsided, and\nI carried out sooner than I had intended a plan already formed to leave\nmy country house and take another. We had no further return of the\nphenomena.\n\"I ought to have mentioned in the proper place that we had one or two\ncases of what I have now learnt to call materialisation. The first was a\ndelicate pink hand like a child's, which my wife saw drumming on the\nwindow-pane. She afterwards saw on the same pane two dark living things\nlike leeches, which frightened her into a swoon. Another time I was alone\nin the house with my wife, who was asleep, and I tried to get a sight of what\nit was that was rapping on the floor of her room. Time after time the\nrapping stopped at the moment I looked in, and began again as soon as I\nwent away. But at last I rushed in just as the raps were beginning, and\n\f330 [Supplement.\nHarlow Gale.\nwas numbed with horror. I saw a tiny pink hand, like a child's, spring up\nfrom the floor, disappear behind my wife's coverlet, and pull at the folds, so\nthat I could see with what unnatural quickness the folds moved, beginning\nfrom the lower end to the point by her side where the hand had disappeared.\nI was horrified, because from my wife's position it was absolutely impossible\nthat the hand could be her own.\n'' I have only to add that my wife was a healthy, religious, quiet,\naffectionate woman, who suffered from no ill-health till her death from\nchild-birth eight years later.\"\nThese events, as has been said, happened more than twenty years ago.\nBut Mr. Aksakoff has done his best to collect all the contemporary\nconfirmative evidence, including letters written at the time, certificates from\nseveral of the witnesses, the account as it was published at an early stage of\nthe phenomena in the Uralsk Gazette, and the report of Messrs. Akutin and\nSavicheff, in which they say that ' ' there is nothing which is not the work of\nhuman hands.\" The grounds on which they base this conclusion appear to\nbe that the raps could be imitated, and that when so produced it was\ngenerally very difficult to locate the spot from which they came ; and that\nthe flying objects were never seen to start, and could only be observed when\nflying or falling. They do not appear to have grappled with the facts as\nstated by Mr. Shchapoff ; but of course their adverse verdict cannot be\nentirely set aside. Finally it should be added that Mr. Aksakoff has\ncopiously annotated the narrative with references to similar phenomena in\nthe spiritistic literature with which he is so intimately acquainted. These\nnotes are not the least valuable portion of the publication.\nThis long notice must close with very brief mention of another curious\ncase, in which similar phenomena occurred in a Russian peasant's hut near\nNijni Novgorod. The noises and the throwing of objects were here\naccompanied by voices, which personated the '' domovoi \" or house-spirit\nwho in popular belief is attached to every Russian home. The voices used\nto hold friendly and jocose conversations with the inmates at night, when\nthe lights were out ; they represented themselves to be a spirit peasant\nfamily, and discussed such village matters as would be of interest to a moujik.\nThe medium in this case was a little girl of eight years old, and the question\nwhether she could not have played the part without any external assistance\nmainly turns on the physical possibility of so small a child producing the\nbass voice in which the father domovoi used to talk. Here, as in Mr.\nShchapoffs case, the authorities intervened with legal proceedings on the\nground of cheating. The family made a pilgrimage to a neighbouring\nmonastery to ask for a cessation of the trouble, and this measure proved\nsuccessful.\nWalter Leaf.\nA Scientific Demonstration of the Future Life. By Thomson Jay\nHudson, Author of The Law of Psychic Phenomena, etc. (Chicago :\nA. C. McClurgand Co., 1895.)\n\" The object of this book is to outline a method of scientific inquiry\nconcerning the powers, attributes, and destiny of the soul, and to specifically\npoint out and classify a sufficient number of the well authenticated facts of\n\fSupplement.] 331\nReviews.\npsychic science to demonstrate the fact of a future life for mankind. \" \"In\npursuing this inquiry, I have endeavoured to follow the strictest rules of\nscientific induction, taking nothing for granted that is not axiomatic, and\nholding that there is nothing worthy of belief that is not sustained by a solid\nbasis of well-authenticated facts.\" (Preface).\nThe main argument of the book is summarily stated in the concluding\nchapter as follows :\u2014\"If Nature is constant, no faculty of the human mind\nexists without a normal function to perform. If no faculty exists without\na normal function to perform, those faculties which do exist must perform\ntheir functions either in this life or a future life. If man possesses\nfaculties which perform no normal function in this life, it follows that the\nfunctions of such faculties must be performed in a future life. Or, to put\nthe argument in a still more concise and purely syllogistic form, the proposi\ntions stand thus :\u2014\n' ' Every faculty of the human mind has a normal function to perform\neither in this life or in a future life.\n' ' Some faculties of the human mind perform no normal functions in this\nlife.\n'' Therefore, some facilities of tlie human mind are destined to perform\ntheirj'unctions in a future life.\n\"No scientist will for a moment question the soundness of the major\npremise of the above syllogism. It is self-evident,\u2014axiomatic.\n\" No one who is at all familiar with the results of modern scientific\nresearch in the field of psychic phenomena will for a moment gainsay the\nminor premise. The one faculty of telepathy alone is demonstrative of the\nsoundness of that proposition, to say nothing of the faculty of intuitive\nperception, etc.\n\"The major and minor premises being each demonstrably true, the\nsoundness of the conclusion that man is destined to inherit a future life is\nself-evident.\" (p. 321.)\nWe need hardly say that the major premise of this argument would meet\nwith much questioning by those scientists who no longer believe in \" facul\nties,\" but who are finding more and more of the inter-connection of states of\nconsciousness and of sub-consciousness, and of the dependence of all these\nstates on the nervous mechanism.1\nThe minor premise rests on the evidence on which the author bases his\nfundamental distinction between the subjective and objective mind. This\ntheory of a dual mind, which was a \"working hypothesis,\" and \"formulated\ntentatively\" in the earlier book, he now believes to have been \"abundantly\ndemonstrated by the facts of experimental hypnotism, cerebral anatomy, and\nexperimental surgery.\" (p. 318.)\nIn the second book he proceeds in this way to carry it to its \" legitimate\nconclusions.\" The \"faculties\" of the \" subjective mind \" have increased\nin number, definiteness and extent since the earlier book. (See the review\nof The Law of Psychic Phenomena, Proceedings S.P.R., Part XXIV., Vol.\n1 Compare the book under review with, e.g., the late and great \"Gehirn und\nSeele.\" Flechsig : 2te Ausgabe, mit Anmerkungen, 1896.\n\f332 [Supplement.\nHarlow Gale.\nIX., p. 231, and the book itself, pp. 29, 46, 62, 151, 208, 250, 287-294.)\nThey are recapitulated in the Scientific Demonstration as follows :\u2014\n\" 1. The subjective mind is constantly amenable to control by the power\nof suggestion.\n\"2. It is incapable of independent reasoning by the processes of\ninduction.\n\" 3. Its power to reason deductively from given premises to correct\nconclusions is practically perfect.\n\"4. It is endowed with a perfect memory.\n\"5. It is the seat of the emotions.\n\"6. It possesses the power to move ponderable objects without physical\ncontact.\n\"7. It has the power to communicate and receive intelligence otherwise\nthan through the recognised channels of the senses.\n\"8.

It is endowed with the faculties of instinct and intuition, and,\nunder certain conditions, with the power of intuitive cognition or perception\nof the laws of Nature.\n\" It needs no argument or illustration to show that the objective mind\nhas little in common with the subjective in any of the foregoing attributes,\npowers, and limitations. The objective mind (1) is manifestly not con\ntrollable by the power of suggestion in the sense in which the subjective\nmind is so controlled,\u2014that is, against reason, experience, and the evidence of\nthe senses ; (2) it is capable of inductive reasoning ; (3) its power of de\nductive reasoning is by no means perfect, nor does it approach perfection ;\n(4) its memory, in its best estate, is very defective, and comparatively\nspeaking, amounts to nothing more than an uncertain, evanescent ability to\nrecall a few of the more prominent ideas and impressions which it has once\nexperienced ; (5) it is absolutely destitute of emotion ; (6) it cannot exercise\nthe slightest kinetic force beyond the range of physical contact ; (7) it is\ndestitute of any power remotely akin to telepathy ; (8) the essential pre\nrequisite to the successful exercise of its highest powers and functions is a\nperfectly sound, healthy, normal physical organism ; (9) it is endowed with\nno power which is remotely akin to instinct or intuition.\" (pp. 225-6.)\nThe powers belonging exclusively to the subjective mind are held to\nconstitute a \"set of faculties, each perfect in itself and complete in the\naggregate,\u2014that is to say, every faculty, attribute, and power necessary to\nconstitute a complete personality being present in perfection ; and we find\nthat the most important of those faculties perform no normal function in\nphysical life.\n' ' Here, then, we have a personality, connascent with the physical\norganism, but possessing independent powers ; a distinct entity, with the\nintellect of a god ; a human soul, filled with human emotions, affections,\nhopes, aspirations, and desires ; longing for immorta life with a passionate\nyearning that passeth understanding ; possessing, in a word, all the in\ntellectual and moral attributes of a perfect manhood, together with a kinetic\nforce often transcending, in its visible manifestations, the power of the\n\fSupplement.] 333\nReviews.\nphysical frame ; in a word, 'a perfect being, nobly planned,'\u2014a being of\ngodlike powers and infinite possibilities.\n\" Is it conceivable that there has been created such a manhood without\na mission, such faculties without a function, such powers without a purpose?\"\n(pp. 319 and 320.)\nIt ought, however, to be observed that the final syllogism, before quoted,\ndoes not involve the theory of the dual mind. \"Not,\" says the author,\n\"that I have the slightest doubt of the scientific accuracy of that hypothesis;\nfor I can have none in view of the array of facts which have been presented.\nBut, as I have already pointed out, the theory of a dual mind and the theory\nof a unitary mind with dual faculties are concurrent hypotheses, and lead to\nidentical conclusions. Hypothesis is not a final dogma : it is merely an\ninstrument of logic. It is the divining-rod of truth. Facts are primordial,\nantecedent, and ultimate, and exist independently of any hypothesis that\nmay be employed to account for them. ... If the facts which have\nbeen adduced do not demonstrate my thesis, crudely and imperfectly as they\nliave been presented, then Nature herself has performed a miracle, and\ndemonstrated her inconstancy.\" (pp. 321-2.)\nIn looking back through the book for the \"facts\" thus confidently\nappealed to, one finds only one new line of evidence over the former book,\nviz., Chap. XV., \" Duality Demonstrated by Anatomy.\" Here Hammond's 1\nTreatise on Insanity is quoted to show that \" certain faculties of the mind\n[instincts] are not confined \" to the brain. This is suddenly transformed by\na paralogism into \"higher functions of intellect,\" (p. 245) and these are given\nthe name, \"subjective mind,\" and so \"demonstrated\" to be independent\nof the cerebral hemispheres. Since no other work on the anatomy and\nphysiology of the nervous system is quoted, we wonder if possibly the\nauthor did not get the inspiration for this \"new argument \" from the quota\ntion of Dr. Hammond's in Sargent's Scientific Basis of Spiritualism, (Boston,\nColby and Rich, 5th Ed., 1887):\u2014\"In the fact that the spinal cord and\nsympathetic ganglia are not devoid of mental power, we find an explanation\nof some of the most startling facts of what is called Spiritualism.\" (p. 228.)\nAside from this anatomical demonstration, there is only repetition of the\nuncritical and loosely stated evidence of the kind given in The Law of\nPsychic Phenomena. The hope expressed that the review of that work in the\nProceedings, Vol. IX., p. 234, would perhaps stimulate the author to some\nthing more of that \" steady experiment and laborious accuracy which alone\ncan help towards his avowed object of ' bringing Psychology within the domain\nof the exact sciences ' \"\u2014this hope is sorely disappointed in the Scientific\nDemonstration of the Future Life. For, after getting the confidence of the\nreader through the introductory apostrophe to Bacon and the inductive\nmethod, and after a very wholesome criticism of the defectiveness of the old\narguments of Analogy, Authority, Metaphysics and Instinctive desire, the\nauthor then gives us no new evidential material, either of observation or\nexperiment.\nHe simply \"explains\" everything ever reported in spiritism, hypnotism,\ntelepathy, clairvoyance, and religion, by means of his subjective and\n1 This author is elsewhere (p. 302) credited with having \"forever settled the\nrelations between psychic conditions and nervous diseases.\"\n\f334 [Supplement-\nHarlow Gale.\nobjective entities. This is at bottom similar to the strife over Apperception\nin Psychology. For \"subjective\" and \"apperceptive\" are both most\nconvenient and even necessary terms for the description of psychical phe\nnomena, but to personify those terms into faculties or entities for the\nexplanation of the phenomena,\u2014this is bringing regression to metaphysical\nconfusion into our modern Psychology, which is trying so hard to be\nscientific. On the other hand, the author energetically snatches away the\nonly class of cases which seem to many of us to offer any evidential\npossibility or probability\u2014not to speak of \"demonstration\" (of which we\nare finding less and less in this world, not to speak of any other)\u2014viz., the\nresidual cases in spiritism. The following method of a forced disjunctive is\nvery characteristic of a controversialist who makes a parade of \"logic \" and\n\" the rules of correct reasoning.\"\n\"I hold that so-called spiritistic phenomena are valuable as evidence of\na future life only on the supposition that none of them emanate from dis\nembodied spirits. My reasons are briefly these :\u2014\n\" In the first place, two antagonistic hypotheses cannot both be correct ;\nnor can each be partly true and partly false : for any hypothesis that does\nnot explain all the facts is necessarily wrong, and therefore utterly valueless.\nThus, if any one of a series of so-called spiritistic phenomena can be demon\nstrated to emanate from disembodied spirits, the telepathic hypothesis is\nnecessarily invalid as a solvent for that series of phenomena. On the other\nhand, if one of said series can be demonstrated to be referable to tele\npathy between living persons, the spiritistic hypothesis is necessarily wrong.\nIn other words, it is a logical necessity that, as between two antagonistic\nhypotheses, one or the other must be wholly right and the other wholly\nwrong, or both must be wholly wrong. The nature of the case does not\nadmit of compromise ; for principles of natural law are not established by\nmajorities of facts, nor are there exceptions in the operation of natural laws.\nIt follows that if one psychic phenomenon could be scientifically demon\nstrated to have been produced by disembodied spirits, the whole subject\nwould be relegated to logical chaos, and some solution of the mystery would\nhave to be sought for other than that embraced in either of the hypotheses\nunder consideration.\" (pp. 112-113.)\nThis being so, we are not surprised that the author, in controverting the\nviews of Messrs. Savage and Myers, is indignantly aroused to a \" protest,\nin the name of outraged science, against all attempts to base a hypothesis\nupon a ' small residuum ' of phenomena.\" (p. 105.)\nHis criticism of a \" test case \" of Mr. Savage is, we think, just ; but his\nintroduction of Mr. Myers' name into this discussion is rather unwarrantable.\nAt the same time, he politely adds that \"the scientific world will never\ncease to be grateful to them for the painstaking care which they have\nexercised in eliminating the ' vast bulk ' of the phenomena which have been\nattributed to supermundane agency ; and if I have succeeded in reducing\nthem to a ' still smaller residuum, ' I shall beg the privilege of quietly\nbasking in the reflected glory of their achievements.\" (pp. 111-112).\nThat this \"still smaller residuum\" equals 0 the author also apparently\nbelieves, because \"the unmistakable import of the closing clauses of the\nparable [of the rich man and Lazarus] is that it is neither expedient nor\n\fWi'eme: Supplement.) 335\nReviews.\nwptM possible, for any purpose whatever, for spirits of the dead to communicate\nh m<\u00ab with the living.\" (pp. 324-325.)\n.il pie- Indeed, so far from complaining of his want of appreciation of the\n>r tie scientific work of the S.P.R., we are rather disposed to regret that he often\nivsial exaggerates our results. We do not presume to claim that \" no law or\ntu be power of Nature has been more completely and scientifically demonstrated\nf tie than has been the law of telepathy \" (pp. 68, 197) ; still less that \" no\nntial phenomenon in the realm of physical science is better authenticated than\ni ire those of so-called spiritism.\" (p. 54.)\nthe t In conclusion, we cannot but regard the somewhat pretentious claim\ne is which this book makes to \"demonstration\" and the maintenance of a strictly\nand \"scientific\" standard of reasoning as unfounded. The book may possibly\ngain popularity from the general interest in the subject, the strong desire in\nt of many minds for a confirmation of popular religious ideas by the light of\nlis- science, and certain attractive qualities of the author's style : but it is hardly\nlikely to contribute to the advance of knowledge in matters of psychical\na . research.\nHarlow Gale.\nUniversity of Minnesota, Minneapolis.\n\u25a0ss.\nin\u25a0\nb\n:\ne-\nj.\nT\n!('\ny\n\f6\n>\n\fGeneral Meeting. 337\nPROCEEDINGS OF GENERAL MEETING.\nThe 84th General Meeting of the Society was held at the West\nminster Town Hall on Friday, January 29th, 1897, at 4 p.m. ; the\nPresident, Mr. W.

It fills me with deep con\ncern to give an address, with such authority as a President's chair\nconfers, upon a science which, though still in a purely nascent stage,\nseems to me at least as important as any other science whatever.\nPsychical science, as we here try to pursue it, is the embryo of some\nthing which in time may dominate the whole world of thought. This\npossibility\u2014nay probability\u2014 does not make it the easier to me now.\nEmbryonic development is apt to be both rapid and interesting ; yet\nthe prudent man shrinks from dogmatising on the egg until he has\nseen the chicken.\nNevertheless, I desire, if I can, to say a helpful word. And I ask\nmyself what kind of helpful word. Is there any connexion between\nmy old-standing interest in pyschical problems and such original work\nas I may have been able to do in other branches of science 1\nI think there is such a connexion\u2014that the most helpful quality\nwhich has aided me in psychical problems and has made me lucky in\nphysical discoveries (sometimes of rather unexpected kinds), has\nsimply been my knowledge\u2014my vital knowledge, if I may so term it\n\u2014of my own ignorance.\nMost students of Nature sooner or later pass through a process of\nwriting off a large percentage of their supposed capital of knowledge\nas a merely illusory asset. As we trace more accurately certain\nfamiliar sequences of phenomena, we begin to realise how closely these\nsequences, or laws, as we call them, are hemmed round by still other\nlaws of which we can form no notion. With myself, this writing off of\nillusory assets has gone rather far; and the cobweb of supposed\nknowledge has been pinched (as some one has phrased) into a par\nticularly small pill.\nI am not disposed to bewail the limitations imposed by human\nignorance. On the contrary, I feel ignorance is a healthful stimulant ;\nand my enforced conviction that neither I nor any one can possibly lay\ndown beforehand what does not exist in the universe, or even what is\nnot going on all round us every day of our lives, leaves me with a\ncheerful hope that something very new and very arresting may turn\nup anywhere at any minute.\nWell, it was this attitude of a mind \" to let,\" which first brought\nnic across Mr. D. D. Home, and which led to my getting a glimpse of\n\fPresident's Address. 339\nsome important laws of matter and energy of which I fear many of\nmy fellow physicists still prefer to be uncognizant. It is this same\naccessible temper of mind which leads me to follow the problems of the\nSociety for Psychical Research with an interest which, if somewhat\ncalmed by advancing years, and by a perception of the inevitable\nslowness of discovery, is still as deep a feeling as any which life has\nleft me. And I shall try to utilise this temper of mind to day by\nclearing away, so far as I can, certain presuppositions, on one side\nor on the other, which seem to me to depend upon a too hasty assump\ntion that we know more about the universe than as yet we really can\nknow.\nI will take the most essential part first, and address myself to those\nwho believe with me in the survival of man's individuality after death.\nI will point out a curious, inveterate, and widespread illusion,\u2014-the\nillusion that our earthly bodies are a kind of norm of humanity, so\nthat ethereal bodies, if such there be, must correspond to them in shape\nand size.\nWhen we take a physical view of a human being in his highest\nform of development, he is seen to consist essentially of a thinking\nbrain, the brain itself, among its manifold functions, being a trans\nformer whereby intelligent will-power is enabled to react on matter.\nTo communicate with the external world, the brain requires organs by\nwhich it can be transported from place to place, and other organs by\nmeans of which energy is supplied to replace that expended in the\nexercise of its own special functions. Again, waste of tissue and\nreparation have to be provided for ; hence the necessity for organs of\ndigestion, assimilation, circulation, respiration, (fee, to carry on these\nprocesses effectually ; and when we consider that this highly complex\norgan is fitted to undergo active work for the best part of a century,\nwe cannot but marvel that it can keep in tune so long. The human\ncreature represents the most perfect thinking and acting machine yet\nevolved on this earth, developing through countless ages in strict\nharmony with the surrounding conditions of temperature, atmosphere,\nlight and gravitation. The profound modifications in the human\nframe which any important alteration in either of these factors would\noccasion are strangely unconsidered. It is true there have been\nquestionings as to the effects that might be occasioned by changes in\ntemperature and atmospheric composition, but possible variations\nin gravitation seem almost to have escaped notice. The human body,\nwhich long experience and habit have taught us to consider in its\nhighest development as the perfection of beauty and grace,\u2014\"formed\nin the image of God,\"\u2014is entirely conditioned by the strength of\ngravitation on this globe. So far as has been possible to ascertain,\nthe intensity of gravity has not varied appreciably within those\n2 a 2\n\f340 President's Address,\ngeologic ages covering the existence of animated thinking beings.\nThe human race, therefore, has passed through all its periods of\nevolution and development, in strict conformity with and submission\nto this dominant power, until it is difficult to conceive any great\ndeparture from the narrow limits imposed on the proportions of the\nhuman frame.\nIn the first place, I wish to consider what transformation in our\nappearance would be produced by a change in the force of gravitation.\nLet us take extreme cases. Say that the power of gravitation\nwere to be doubled. In that case we should have to exert a vastly\nincreased strength to support ourselves in any other than the prone\nor dorsal position\u2014it would be hard to rise from the ground, to run,\nleap, climb, to drag or carry any object. Our muscles would neces\nsarily be more powerful, and the skeleton to which they are attached\nwould need corresponding modification. To work such limbs a more\nrapid transformation of matter would be required ; hence the supply\nof nutriment must be greater, involving enlarged digestive organs, and a\nlarger respiratory apparatus to allow of the perfect aeration of the\nincreased mass of the blood. To keep up the circulation with the\nnecessary force, either the heart would have to be more powerful or\nthe distance through which the blood would require to be impelled\nmust be reduced. The increased amount of nourishment demanded\nwould involve a corresponding increase in the difficulty of its collection,\nand the struggle for existence would be intensified. More food being\nrequired day by day, the jaws would have to be enlarged and the\nmuscles strengthened. The teeth also must be adapted for extra\ntearing and grinding.\nThese considerations involve marked changes in the structure\nof human beings. To accord with thickened bones, bulging muscles,\nand larger respiratory and digestive apparatus, the body would be\nheavier and more massive. The necessity for such alterations in struc\nture would be increased by the liability to fall. The necessity of\nkeeping the centre of gravity low, and the great demands made on the\nsystem in other respects must conspire to reduce the size of head and\nbrain. With increase of gravitation, the bipedal form would be beset\nby drawbacks. Assuming that the human race, under the altered\ncircumstances, remained bipedal, it is highly probable that a large\nincrease in the quadruped, hexapod, or octopod structure would prevail\nin the animal kingdom. The majority of animals would be of the\nSaurian class with very short legs, allowing the trunk to rest easily on\nthe ground, and the serpent type would probably be in the ascendant.\nWinged creatures would suffer severely, and small birds and insects\nwould be dragged to earth by a force hard to resist ; although this\nmight be more or less compensated by the increased density of the air.\n\fPresident's Address. 341\nHumming birds, dragon-flies, butterflies, and bees, all of which spend\na large portion of their time in the air, would, in the struggle for\nexistence, be rare visitants. Hence the fertilisation of flowers by the\nintervention of insects must be thwarted ; and this would lead to the\nextinction, or at all events to a scarcity, of entomophilous plants, i.e.,\nall those with the showiest blossoms\u2014a gloomy result to follow from a\nmere increase of the earth's attraction.\nBut having known no other type of human form, it is allowable to\nthink that, under these different conditions, Man would still consider\nWoman\u2014 though stunted, thick-limbed, flat-footed, with enormous jaws\nunderlying a diminutive skull\u2014as the highest type of beauty !\nDecreased attraction of the earth might be attended with another\nset of changes scarcely less remarkable. With the same expenditure of\nvital energy as at present, and with the same quantity of transformation\nof matter, we should be able to lift heavier weights, to take longer\nbounds, to move with greater swiftness, and to undergo prolonged\nmuscular exertion with less fatigue\u2014possibly to fly. Hence the\ntransformation of matter required to keep up animal heat, and to\nrestore the waste of energy and tissue, would be smaller for the same\namount of duty done. A less volume of blood, reduced lungs and\ndigestive organs would be required. Thus we might expect a set of\nstructural changes of an inverse nature to those resulting from\nintensified gravitation. All parts of the body might safely be\nconstructed upon a less massive plan\u2014a slighter skeleton, smaller\nmuscles, and slenderer trunk. These modifications, in a less degree than\nwe are contemplating, tend in the present to beauty of form, and it is\neasy to imagine our aesthetic feelings would naturally keep pace with\nfurther developments in the direction of grace, slenderness, symmetry,\nand tall figures.\nIt is curious that the popular conceptions of evil and malignant\nbeings are of the type that would be produced by increased gravitation,\n\u2014toads, reptiles, and noisome creeping things,\u2014while the Arch Fiend\nhimself is represented as perhaps the ultimate form which could be\nassumed by a thinking brain and its necessary machinery were the\npower of gravitation to be increased to the highest point compatible\nwith existence\u2014a serpent crawling along the ground. On the other\nhand, our highest types of beauty are those which would be common\nunder decreased gravitation.\nThe \" daughter of the gods, divinely tall,\" and the leaping athlete,\nplease us by the slight triumph over the earthward pull which their\nstature or spring implies. It is true we do not correspondingly admire\nthe flea, whose triumph over gravitation, unaided by wings, is so\nstriking. Marvellous as is the flea, its body, like ours, is strictly con\nditioned by gravitation.\n\f342 President's A ddress.\nBut popular imagination presupposes spiritual beings to be utterly\nindependent of gravitation, whilst retaining shapes and proportions\nwhich gravitation originally determined, and only gravitation seems\nlikely to maintain\nWhen and if spiritual beings make themselves visible either to our\nbodily eyes or to our inward vision, their object would be thwarted\nwere they not to appear in a recognisable form ; so that their appear\nance would take the shape of the body and clothing to which we\nhave been accustomed. Materiality, form, and space, I am constrained\nto believe, are temporary conditions of our present existence. It is\ndifficult to conceive the idea of a spiritual being having a body like\nours, conditioned by the exact gravitating force exerted by the earth,\nand with organs which presuppose the need for food and necessity for\nthe removal of waste products. It is equally difficult, hemmed in and\nbound round as we are by materialistic ideas, to think of intelligence,\nthought, and will, existing without form or matter, and untrammelled\nby gravitation or space.\nMen of science before now have had to face a similar problem. In\nsome speculations on the nature of matter, Faraday1 expressed himself\n1 \"If we must assume at all, as indeed in a branch of knowledge like the present\nwe can hardly help it, then the safest course appears to be to assume as little as\npossible, and in that respect the atoms of Boscovich appear to me to have a great\nadvantage over the more usual notion. His atoms are mere centres of forces or\npowers, not particles of matter, in which the powers themselves reside.\"\n\"If in the ordinary view of atoms, we call the particle of matter away from the\npowers a, and the system of powers or forces in and around it m, then in Boscovich's\ntheory a disappears, or is a mere mathematical point, whilst in the usual notion it is\na little unchangeable, impenetrable piece of matter, and m is an atmosphere of force\ngrouped around it.\"\n\"To my mind therefore, the a or nucleus vanishes, and thesubstance consists of the\npowers or m ; and indeed, what notion can we form of the nucleus independent of its\npowers ? All our perception and knowledge of the atom, and even our fancy, is limited\nto ideas of its powers : what thought remains on which to hang the imagination of an\na independent of the acknowledged forces ? \"\n\" A mind just entering on the subject may consider it difficult to think of the\npowers of matter independent of a separate something to be called the matter, but it\nis certainly far more difficult, and indeed impossible, to think of or imagine that\nmatter independent of the powers. Now the powers we know and recognise in every\nphenomenon of the creation, the abstract matter in none ; why then assume the\nexistence of that of which we are ignorant, which we cannot conceive, and for which\nthere is no philosophical necessity ? \"\n\" If an atom be conceived to be a centre of power, that which is ordinarily referred\nto under the term shape would be now referred to the disposition and relative\nintensity of the forces. . . . Nothing can be supposed of the disposition of forces\nin and about a solid nucleus of matter, which cannot be equally conceived with\nrespect to a centre.\"\n\" The view now stated of the constitution of matter would seem to involve\nnecessarily the conclusion that matter fills all space. ... In that view matter is\nnot merely mutually penetrable, but each atom extends, so to say, throughout the\nI whole of the solar system, yet always retaining its own centre of force.\"\u2014Faeaday,\nI \" On the Nature of Matter,\" Phil. Mag., 1844, vol. xxiv., p. 13G.\n\fPresident's Address. 343\nin language which, mutatis mutandis, applies to my present sur\nmises. This earnest philosopher was speculating on the ultimate nature\nof matter ; and, thinking of the little, hard, impenetrable atom of\nLucretius, and the forces or forms of energy appertaining to it, he\nfelt himself impelled to reject the idea of the existence of the nucleus\naltogether, and to think only of the forces and forms of energy usually\nassociated therewith. He was led to the conclusion that this view\nnecessarily involved the surmise that the atoms are not merely mutually\npenetrable, but that each atom, so to say, extends throughout all space,\nyet always retaining its own centre of force.1\nA view of the constitution of matter which recommended itself to\nFaraday as preferable to the one ordinarily held, appears to me to be\nexactly the view I endeavour to picture as the constitution of spiritual\nbeings. Centres of intellect, will, energy, and power, each mutually\npenetrable, whilst at the same time permeating what we call space ;\nbut each centre retaining its own individuality, persistence of self, and\nmemory. Whether these intelligent centres of the various spiritual\nforces which in their aggregate go to make up Man's character or\nKarma, are also associated in any way with the forms of energy\nwhich, centred, form the material atom,\u2014whether these spiritual\nentities are material, not in the crude, gross sense of Lucretius, but\nmaterial as sublimated through the piercing intellect of Faraday,\u2014is\none of those mysteries which to us mortals will perhaps ever remain an\nunsolved problem.\nMy next speculation is more difficult, and is addressed to those who\nnot only take too terrestrial a view, but who deny the plausibility\u2014nay,\nthe possibility\u2014of the existence of an unseen world at all. I reply we\nare demonstrably standing on the brink, at any rate, of one unseen\nworld. I do not here speak of a spiritual or immaterial world. I speak\nof the world of the infinitely little, which must be still called a\nmaterial world, although matter as therein existing or perceptible is\nsomething which our limited faculties do not enable us to conceive. It\nis the world\u2014I do not say of molecular forces as opposed to molar, but\nof forces whose action lies mainly outside the limit of human perception,\nas opposed to forces evident to the gross perception of human organisms.\nI hardly know how to make clear to myself or to you the difference in\nthe apparent laws of the universe which would follow upon a mere\ndifference of bulk in the observer. Such an observer I must needs\nimagine as best I can. I shall not attempt to rival the vividness of\nthe great satirist who, from a postulated difference of size far less\nconsiderable, deduced in \"Gulliver's Travels\" the absurdity, and the\nmere relativity, of so much in human morals, politics, society. But I\n1 I may say, in passing, that the modern vortex atom also fulfils these conditio\n\f344 President's Address.\nshall take courage from the example of my predecessor in this chair,\nProfessor William James of Harvard, from whom later I shall cite a\nmost striking parable of precisely the type I seek.\nYou must permit me, then, a homunculus on whom to hang my\nspeculation. I cannot place him actually amid the interplay of\nmolecules, for lack of power to imagine his environment ; but I shall\nmake him of such microscopic size that molecular forces which in\ncommon life we hardly notice,\u2014such as surface-tension, capillarity;,\nthe Brownian movements,\u2014become for him so conspicuous and\ndominant that he can hardly believe, let us say, in the universality\nof gravitation, which we may suppose to have been revealed to him\nby ourselves, his creators.\nLet us place him on a cabbage leaf, and let him start for himself.\nThe area of the cabbage-leaf appears to him as a boundless plain\nmany square miles in extent. To this minimised creature the leaf is\nstudded with huge glittering transparent globes, resting motionless\non the surface of the leaf, each globe vastly exceeding in height the\ntowering Pyramids. Each of these spheres appears to emit from\none of its sides a dazzling light. Urged by curiosity he approaches\nand touches one of the orbs. It resists pressure like an india-rubber\nball, until accidentally he fractures the surface, when suddenly he feels\nhimself seized and whirled and brought somewhere to an equilibrium,\nwhere he remains suspended in the surface of the sphere utterly unable\nto extricate himself. In the course of an hour or two he finds the\nglobe diminishing, and ultimately it disappears, leaving him at liberty\nto pursue his travels. Quitting the cabbage-leaf, he strays over the\nsurface of the soil, finding it exceeding rocky and mountainous, until\nhe sees before him a broad surface akin to the kind of matter which\nformed the globes on the cabbage-leaf. Instead, however, of rising\nupwards from its support, it now slopes downwards in a vast curve\nfrom the brink, and ultimately becomes apparently level, though, as\nthis is at a considerable distance from the shore, he cannot be\nabsolutely certain. Let us now suppose that he holds in his hand a\nvessel bearing the same proportion to his minimised frame that a pint\nmeasure does to that of a man as he is, and that by adroit manipula\ntion he contrives to fill it with water. If he inverts the vessel he finds\nthat the liquid will not flow, and can only be dislodged by violent\nshocks. Wearied by his exertions to empty the vessel- of water, he\nsits on the shore, and idly amuses himself by throwing stones and\nother objects into the water. As a rule the stones and other wet\n1 I need hardly say that in this fanciful sketch, composed only for an illustrative\npurpose, all kinds of problems (as of the homunculus's own structure and powers) are\nleft untouched, and various points which would really need to be mathematically\nworked out are left intentionally vague.\n\fPresident's Address. 345\nbodies sink, although when dry they obstinately refuse to go to the\nbottom, but float on the surface. He tries other substances. A rod\nof polished steel, a silver pencil-case, some platinum wire, and a steel\npen, objects two or three times the density of the stones, refuse to sink\nat all, and float on the surface like so many bits of cork. Nay, if he\nand his friends manage to throw into the water one of those enormous\nsteel bars which we call needles, this also makes a sort of concave\ntrough for itself on the surface, and floats tranquilly. After these and\na few more observations, he theorises on the properties of water and of\nliquids in general. Will he come to the conclusion that liquids seek\ntheir own level ; that their surfaces when at rest are horizontal, and\nthat solids when placed in a liquid, sink or float according to their\nhigher or lower specific gravity 1 No ; he will feel justified in inferring\nthat liquids, at rest, assume spherical, or at least curvilinear forms,\nwhether convex or concave, depending upon circumstances not easily\nascertained ; that they cannot be poured from one vessel to another,\nand resist the force of gravitation, which is consequently not universal ;\nand that such bodies as he' can manipulate generally refuse to sink in\nliquids, whether their specific gravity be high or low. From the\nbehaviour of a body placed in contact with a dew-drop he will even\nderive plausible reasons for doubting the inertia of matter.\nAlready he has been somewhat puzzled by the constant and\ncapricious bombardment of cumbrous objects like portmanteaus flying\nin the air ; for the gay motes that people the sunbeams will dance\nsomewhat unpleasantly for a microscopic homunculus who can never\ntell where they are coming. Nay, what he has understood to be the\ndifficulty experienced by living creatures in rising from the earth,\nexcept with wings, will soon seem absurdly exaggerated. For he will\ndiscern a terrific creature, a Behemoth \" in plated mail,\" leaping\nthrough the skies in frenzied search for prey ; and for the first time\ndue homage will be rendered to the majesty of the common flea.\nPerturbed by doubts, he will gaze at night into some absolutely\ntranquil pool. There, with no wind to ruffle, nor access of heat to\ncause currents or change surface-tension, he perceives small inanimate\nobjects immersed and still. But are they still 1 No ! One of them\nmoves ; another is moving. Gradually it is borne in upon him that\nwhenever any object is small enough it is always in motion. Perhaps\nour homunculus might be better able than we are to explain these\nso-called Brownian movements. Or the guess might be forced upon\nhim that he who sees this sight is getting dim glimpses of the ultimate\nstructure of matter, and that these movements are residual, the result\nof the inward molecular turmoil which has not cancelled itself out\ninto nullity, as it must needs do in aggregations of matter of more\nthan the smallest microscopic dimensions.\n\f346 President'8 Address.\nThings still more tormentingly perplexing, our homunculus would\ndoubtless encounter. And these changes in his interpretation of\nphenomena would arise not from his becoming aware of any forces\nhitherto overlooked, still less from the disappearance of laws now-\nrecognised, but simply from the fact that his supposed decrease in\nbodily size brings capillarity, surface-tension, &c., into a relative'\nprominence they do not now possess. To full-grown rational beingsV\nthe effects of these forces rank among residual phenomena which\/\nattract attention only when science has made a certain progress. To\nhomunculi, such as we have imagined, the same effects would be of\ncapital importance, and would be rightly interpreted not as something\nsupplementary to those of general gravitation, but as due to an inde\npendent and possibly antagonistic force.\nThe physics of these homunculi would differ most remarkably from\nour own. Tn the study of heat they would encounter difficulties\nprobably insuperable. In this branch of physical investigation little\ncan be done unless we have the power at pleasure of raising and\nlowering the temperature of bodies. This requires the command of\nfire. Actual man, in a rudimentary state of civilisation, can heat and\nignite certain kinds of matter by friction, percussion, concentrating\nthe sun's rays, &c. ; but before these operations produce actual fire\nthey must be performed upon a considerable mass of matter, otherwise\nthe heat is conducted or radiated away as rapidly as produced, and the\npoint of ignition seldom reached.\nNor could it be otherwise with the chemistry of the little people,^\nif, indeed, such a science be conceived as at all possible for them. V\nIt can scarcely be denied that the fundamental phenomena which\nfirst led mankind into chemical enquiries are those of combustion.\nBut, as we have just seen, minimised beings would be unable to produce\nfire at will, except by certain chemical reactions, and would have little\nopportunity of examining its nature. They might occasionally witness\nforest fires, volcanic eruptions, &c. ; but such grand and catastrophic\nphenomena, though serving to reveal to our supposed Lilliputians the\nexistence of combustion, would be ill-suited for quiet investigation into\nits conditions and products. Moreover, considering the impossibility\nthey would experience of pouring water from one test-tube to another,\nthe ordinary operations of analytical chemistry, and of all manipula\ntions depending on the use of the pneumatic trough, would remain for\never a sealed book.\nLet us for a moment go to the opposite extreme, and consider how\nNature would present itself to human beings of enormous magnitude.\nTheir difficulties and misconstructions would be of an opposite nature\nto those experienced by pigmies. Capillary attraction and the cohesion\nof liquids, surface tension and the curvature of liquid surfaces near\n\fPresident's Address. 347\ntheir boundary, the dew drop and the behaviour of minute bodies on a\nglobule of water, the flotation of metals on the surface of water, and\nmany other familiar phenomena, would be either ignored or unknown.\nThe homunculus able to communicate but a small momentum would\nfind all objects much harder than they appear to us, whilst to a race of\ncolossals granite rocks would be but a feeble impediment.\nThere would be another most remarkable difference between such\nenormous beings and ourselves : if we stoop and take up a pinch of\nearth between fingers and thumb, moving those members, say, through\nthe space of a few inches in a second of time, we experience nothing\nremarkable. The earth offers a little resistance, more or less, according\nto its greater or less tenacity, but no other perceptible reaction\nfollows.\nLet us suppose the same action performed by a gigantic being, able\nto move finger and thumb in a second's space through some miles of\nsoil in the same lapse of time, and he would experience a very decided\nreaction. The mass of sand, earth, stones, and the like, hurled together\nin such quantities and at such speed, would become intensely hot.\nJust as the homunculus would fail to bring about ignition when he\ndesired, so the colossus could scarcely move without causing the libera\ntion of a highly inconvenient degree of heat, literally making everything\ntoo hot to hold. He would naturally ascribe to granite rocks and the\nother constituents of the earth's surface such properties as we attribute\nto phosphorus\u2014of combustion on being a little roughly handled.\nNeed I do more than point the obvious lesson 1 If a possible\u2014\nnay, reasonable\u2014variation in only one of the forces conditioning the\nhuman race\u2014that of gravitation\u2014could so modify our outward form,\nappearance, ancf proportions, as to make us to all intents and purposes\na different race of beings ; if mere differences of size can cause some\nof the most simple facts in chemistry and physics to take so widely\ndifferent a guise ; if beings microscopically small and prodigiously large\nwould simply as such be subject to the hallucinations I have pointed\nout\u2014and to others I might enlarge upon ;\u2014is it not possible that we,\nin turn, though occupying, as it seems to us, the golden mean, may also\nby the mere virtue of our size and weight fall into misinterpretations\nof phenomena from which we should escape were we or the globe we\nInhabit either larger or smaller, heavier or lighter? May not our\nboasted knowledge be simply conditioned by accidental environments,\nand thus be liable to a large~element of subjectivity hitherto unsus\npected and scarcely possible to eliminate 1\nHere I will introduce Prof. James's speculation, to which I have\nalready alluded. It deals with a possible alteration of the time scale\ndue to a difference in rapidity of sensation on the part of a being pre\nsumably on a larger scale than ourselves.\n\f348 President's Address.\n\" We have every reason to think that creatures may possibly differ\nenormously in the amounts of duration which they intuitively feel, and\nin the fineness of the events that may fill it. \"Von Baer has indulged\nin some interesting computations of the effect of such differences in\nchanging the aspect of Nature. Suppose we were able, within the\nlength of a second, to note distinctly 10,000 events, instead of barely\n10, as now ; if our life were then destined to hold the same number of\nimpressions, it might be 1,000 times as short. We should live less\nthan a month, and personally know nothing of the change of seasons.\nIf born in winter we should believe in summer as we now believe in\nthe heats of the carboniferous era. The motions of organic beings\nwould be so slow to our senses as to be inferred, not seen. The sun\nwould stand still in the sky, the moon be almost free from change, and\nso on. But now reverse the hypothesis, and suppose a being to get only\none 1,000th part of the sensations that we get in a given time, and\nconsequently to live 1,000 times as long. Winters and summers will be\nto him like quarters of an hour. Mushrooms and the swifter-growing\nplants will shoot into being so rapidly as to appear instantaneous\ncreations ; annual shrubs will rise and fall from the earth like restlessly\nboiling water-springs ; the motions of animals will be as invisible as are\nto us the movements of bullets and cannon-balls ; the sun will scour\nthrough the sky like a meteor, leaving a fiery trail behind him, &c.\nThat such imaginary cases (barring the super-human longevity) may\nbe realised somewhere in the animal kingdom, it would be rash to\ndeny.\"\u2014(James's Principles of Psychology,\" Vol. i., p. 639).\nAnd now let me specially apply this general conception of the\nimpossibility of predicting what secrets the universe may still hold,\nwhat agencies undivined may habitually be at work around us.\nTelepathy, the transmission of thought and images directly from one\nmind to another, without the agency of the recognised organs of sense,\nis a conception new and strange to science. To judge from the\ncomparative slownesss with which the accumulated evidence of our\nSociety penetrates the scientific world, it is, I think, a conception even\nscientifically repulsive to many minds. We have supplied striking\nexperimental evidence ; but few have been found to repeat our\nexperiments. We have offered good evidence in the observation of\nspontaneous cases,\u2014as apparitions at the moment of death and the\nlike,\u2014but this evidence has failed to impress the scientific world in\nthe same way as evidence less careful and less coherent has often done\nbefore. Our evidence is not confronted and refuted ; it is shirked and\nevaded, as though there were some great a priori improbability which\nabsolved the world of science from considering it. I at least see no\na priori improbability whatever. Our alleged facts might be true in\nall kinds of ways without contradicting any truth already known. I\nwill dwell now on only one possible line of explanation,\u2014not that I see\n\fPresident's A ddress. 349\nany way of elucidating all the new phenomena I regard as genuine,\nbut because it seems probable I may shed a light on some of those\nphenomena. v\nAll the phenomena of the Universe are presumably in some way \\\ncontinuous ; and certain facts, plucked as it were from the very heart of 1\nNature, are likely to be of use in our gradual discovery of facts which J\nlie deeper still.\nLet us then consider the vibrations we trace, not only in solid\nbodies, but in the air, and in a still more remarkable manner in the\nether.\nThese vibrations differ in their velocity and in their frequency.\nThat they exist, extending from one vibration to two thousand billion\nvibrations per second we have good evidence. That they subserve the\npurpose of conveying impressions from outside sources of whatever\nkind to living organisms may be fully recognised.\nAs a starting-point I will take a pendulum beating seconds in air.\nIf I keep on doubling I get a series of steps as follows :\u2014\u25a0\n\/\nStarting-point.\nrr,\n-V1\nThe seconds pendulum.\n2 vibrations per second.\n4 \u201e \u25a0,\n8 ,, >>\n16 \u201e \u201e\n32 ,, \u25a0\n64 \u201e \u00bb\n128\n256\n512 \u201e ,,\n1024\n32768\n1,048576\n33,554432 \u201e\n1073,741824\n34359,738368\n1,099511,627776\n35,184372,088832\n1125,899906,842624\n36028,707018,963968\n72057,594037,927936\n144115,188075,855872\n288220,376151,711744 \u201e\n576440,752303,423488\n1,152881,504606,846976\n2,305763,009213,693952\n4,611526,018427,387904\n9,223052,036854,775808\n\f350 President'8 Address.\nAt the fifth step from unity, at 32 vibrations per second, we reach\nthe region where atmospheric vibration reveals itself to us as sound.\nHere we have the lowest musical note. In the next ten steps the\nvibrations per second rise from 32 to 32,768, and here to the average\nhuman ear the region of sound ends. But certain more highly\nendowed animals probably hear sounds too acute for our organs, that\nis, sounds which vibrate at a higher rate.\nWe next enter a region in which the vibrations rise rapidly, and the\nvibrating medium is no longer the gross atmosphere, but a highly\nattenuated medium, \"a diviner air,\" called the ether. From the 16th\nto the 35th step the vibrations rise from 32,768 to 34359,738368 a\nsecond, such vibrations appearing to our means of observation as\nelectrical rays.\nWe next reach a region extending from the 35th to the 45th step,\nincluding from 34359,738368 to 35,184372,088832 vibrations per\nsecond. This region may be considered as unknown, because we are as\nyet ignorant what are the functions of vibrations of the rates just\nmentioned. But that they have some function it is fair to suppose.\nNow we approach the region of light, the steps extending from the\n45th to between the 50th and the 51st, and the vibrations extending\nfrom 35,184372,088832 per second (heat rays) to 1875,000000,000000\nper second, the highest recorded rays of the spectrum. The actual\nsensation of light, and therefore the vibrations which transmit visible\nsigns, being comprised between the narrow limits of about\n450,000000,000000 (red light) and 750,000000,000000 (violet light)\n\u2014less than one step.\nLeaving the region of visible light, we arrive at what is, for our\nexisting senses and our means of research, another unknown region,\nthe functions of which we are beginning to suspect. It is not unlikely\nthat the X rays of Professor Rontgen will be found to lie between the\n58th and the 61st step, having vibrations extending from 288220,576\n151,711744 to 2,305763,009213,693952 per second or even higher.\nIn this series it will be seen there are two great gaps, or unknown\nregions, concerning which we must own our entire ignorance as to the\npart they play in the economy of creation. Further, whether any\nvibrations exist having a greater number per second than those classes\nmentioned we do not presume to decide.\nBut is it premature to ask in what way are vibrations connected\nwith thought or its transmission? We might speculate that the\nincreasing rapidity or frequency of the vibrations would accompany a\nrise in the importance of the functions of such vibrations. That\nhigh frequency deprives the rays of many attributes that might seem\nincompatible with \" brain waves,\" is undoubted. Thus, rays about the\n62nd step are so minute as to cease to be refracted, reflected or polarised ;\n\fPresident's Address. 351\nthey pass through many so-called opaque Bodies, and research begins\nto show that the most rapid are just those which pass most easily\nthrough dense substances. It does not require much stretch of the\nscientific imagination to conceive that at the 62nd or 63rd step the\ntrammels from which rays at the 61st step were struggling to free\nthemselves, have ceased to influence rays having so enormous a rate\nof vibration as 9,223052,036854,775808 per second, and that these\nrays pierce the densest medium with scarcely any diminution of\nintensity, and pass almost unrefracted and unreflected along their path\nwith the velocity of light.\nOrdinarily we communicate intelligence to each other by speech.\nI first call up in my own brain a picture of a scene I wish to describe,\nand then, by means of an orderly transmission of wave vibrations set\nin motion by my vocal cords through the material atmosphere, a corres\nponding picture is implanted in the brain of any one whose ear is\ncapable of receiving such vibrations. If the scene I wish to impress\non the brain of the recipient is of a complicated character, or if the\npicture of it in my own brain is not definite, the transmission will\nbe more or less imperfect ; but if I wish to get my audience to picture\nto themselves some very simple object, such as a triangle or a circle, the\ntransmission of ideas will be well nigh perfect, and equally clear to\nthe brains of both transmitter and recipient. Here we use the\nvibrations of the material molecules of the atmosphere to transmit\nintelligence from one brain to another.\nIn the newly-discovered Rontgen rays we are introduced to an\norder of vibrations of extremest minuteness as compared with the\nmost minute waves with which we have hitherto been acquainted, and\nof dimensions comparable with the distances between the centres of\nthe atoms of which the material universe is built up ; and there is no\nreason to suppose that we have here reached the limit of frequency.\nWaves of this character cease to have many of the properties asso\nciated with light waves. They are produced in the same etherial\nmedium, and are probably propagated with the same velocity as light,\nbut here the similarity ends. They cannot be regularly reflected from\npolished surfaces ; they have not been polarised ; they are not refracted\non passing from one medium to another of different density, and they\npenetrate considerable thicknesses of substances opaque to light with\nthe same ease with which light passes through glass. It is also demon\nstrated that these rays, as generated in the vacuum tube, are not\nhomogeneous, but consist of bundles of different wave-lengths,\nanalogous to what would be differences of colour could we see them as\nlight. Some pass easily through flesh, but are partially arrested by\nbone, while others pass with almost equal facility through bone and\nflesh.\n\f352 President's Address.\nIt seems to me that in these rays we may have a possible mode of\ntransmitting intelligence, which with a few reasonable postulates, may\nsupply a key to much that is obscure in psychical research. Let it be\nassumed that these rays, or rays even of higher frequency, can pass\ninto the brain and act on some nervous centre there. Let it be conceived\nthat the brain contains a centre which uses these rays as the vocal\ncords use sound vibrations (both being under the command of intelli\ngence), and sends them out, with the velocity of light, to impinge on\nthe receiving ganglion of another brain. In this way some, at least,\nof the phenomena of telepathy, and the transmission of intelligence\nfrom one sensitive to another through long distances, seem to come\ninto the domain of law, and can be grasped. A sensitive may be one\nwho possesses the telepathic transmitting or receiving ganglion in an\nadvanced state of development, or who, by constant practice, is\nrendered more sensitive to these high-frequency waves. Experience\nseems to show that the receiving and the transmitting ganglions are\nnot equally developed ; one may be active, while the other, lite the\npineal eye in man, may be only vestigial. By such a hypothesis no\nphysical laws are violated, neither is it necessary to invoke what is\ncommonly called the supernatural. \u25a0\nTo this hypothesis it may be objected that brain waves, like any\nother waves, must obey physical laws. Therefore, transmission of\nthought must be easier or more certain the nearer the agent and\nrecipient are to each other, and should die out altogether before great\ndistances are reached. Also it can be urged that if brain waves diffuse\nin all directions they should affect all sensitives within their radius of\naction instead of impressing only one brain. The electric telegraph is\nnot a parallel case, for there a material wire intervenes to conduct and\nguide the energy to its destination.\nThese are weighty objections, but not, I think, insurmountable. Far\nbe it from me to say anything disrespectful of the law of inverse squares,\nbut I have already endeavoured to show we are dealing with conditions\nremoved from our material and limited conceptions of space, matter,\nform. Is it inconceivable that intense thought concentrated towards a\nsensitive with whom the thinker is in close sympathy may induce a\ntelepathic chain of brain waves, along which the message of thought\ncan go straight to its goal without loss of energy due to distance 1\nAnd is it also inconceivable that our mundane ideas of space and\ndistance may be superseded in these subtile regions of unsubstantial\nthought where \"near \" and \" far\" may lose their usual meaning 1\nI repeat that this speculation is strictly provisional. I dare to\nsuggest it. The time may come when it will be possible to submit it to\nexperimental tests.\n\fPresident's Address. 353\nI am impelled to one further reflection, dealing with the conserva- 1\ntion of energy. We say with truth that energy is transformed but not i\ndestroyed, and that whenever we can trace the transformation we find I\nit quantitatively exact. So far as our very rough exactness goes, this L\nis true for inorganic matter and for mechanical forces. But it is only\nI inferentially true for organised matter and for vital forces. We cannot\n\/ express life in terms of heat or of motion. And thus it happens that\nI just when the exact transformation of energy will be most interesting\nV to watch, we cannotjreally tell whether any fresh energy has been intro\nduced into the system or not. Let us consider this a little more\nclosely.\nIt has, of course, always been realised by physicists, and has been\nespecially pointed out by Dr. Croll, that there is a wide difference\nbetween the production of motion and the direction of it into a par\nticular channel. The production of motion, molar or molecular, is\ngoverned by physical laws, which it is the business of the philosopher\nto find out and correlate. The law of the conservation of energy\noverrides all laws, and it is a pre-eminent canon of scientific belief that\nfor every act done a corresponding expenditure of energy must be\ntransformed! No work can be effected without using up a corres\nponding value in energy of another kind. But to us the other side of\nthe problem is even of more importance. Granted the existence of a\ncertain kind of molecular motion, what is it that determines its\ndirection along one path rather than another 1 A weight falls to the\nearth through a distance of three feet. I lift it, and let it fall once\nmore. In these movements of the weight a certain amount of energy\nis expended in its rise, and the same amount is liberated in its fall.\nBut instead of letting the weight fall free, suppose I harness it to a\ncomplicated system of wheels, and, instead of letting the weight fall\nin a fraction of a second, I distribute its fall over twenty-four hours.\nNo more energy is expended in raising the weight, and in its slow fall\nno more or less energy is developed than when it fell free ; but I have\nmade it do work of another kind. It now drives a clock, a telescope\nor a philosophic instrument, and does what we call useful work. The\nclock runs down. I lift the weight by exerting the proper amount of\nenergy, and in this action the law of conservation of energy is strictly\nobeyed. But now I have the choice of either letting the weight fall\nfree in a fraction of a second, or, constrained by the wheelwork, in\ntwenty-four hours. I can do which I like, and whichever way I decide,\nno more energy is developed in the fall of the weight. I strike a\nmatch : I can use it to light a cigarette or to set fire to a house. I\nwrite a telegram : it may be simply to say I shall be late for dinner,\nor it may produce fluctuations on the Stock Exchange that will ruin\nthousands. In these cases the actual force required in striking the\n\u2014\u2014^\u2014WMM\u2014im\u2122\u2014imm\n\f354 President's Address,\nmatch or in writing the telegram is governed by the law of conserva\ntion of energy ; but the vastly more momentous part, which determines^\nthe words I use or the material I ignite, is beyond such a law. It is\n\u25a0pfobabTe thatHo \"expenditure of energy need be used in the determina\ntion of direction one way more than another. Intelligence and free\nwill here come into play, and these mystic forces are outside the law\nof conservation of energy as understood by physicists.\nThe whole universe as we see it is the result of molecular move\nment. Molecular movements strictly obey the law of conservation of\nenergy, but what we call \" law \" is simply an expression of the direc\ntion along which a form of energy acts, not the form of energy itself.\nWe may explain molecular and molar motions, and discover all the\nphysical laws of motion, but we shall be far as ever from a solution of\nthe vastly more important question as to what form of will and intellect\nis behind the motions of molecules, guiding and constraining them\nin definite directions along pre-determined paths. What is the deter\nmining cause in the background? What combination of will and\nintellect, outside our physical laws, guides the fortuitous concourse of\natoms along ordered paths culminating in the material world in which\nwe live 1\ni\nIn these last sentences I have intentionally used words of wide\nsignification\u2014have spoken of guidance along ordered paths. It is\nwisdom to be vague here, for we absolutely cannot say whether or\nwhen any diversion may be introduced into the existing system of\nearthly forces by an external power. We can no more be certain that\nthis is not so than I can be certain in an express train that no signal\nman has pressed a handle to direct the train on to this or that line of\nrails. I may compute exactly how much coal is used per mile, so as to\nbe able to say at any minute how many miles we have travelled, but,\nunless I actually see the points, I cannot tell whether they are shifted\nbefore the train passes.\nAn omnipotent being could rule the course of this world in such\na way that none of us should discover the hidden springs of action.\nHe need not make the Sun stand still upon Gibeon. He could do all\nthat he wanted by the expenditure of infinitesimal diverting force\nupon ultra-microscopic modifications of the human germ.\nIn this address I have not attempted to add any item to the\nsound knowledge which I believe our Society is gradually amassing.\nI shall be content if I have helped to clear away some of those\nscientific stumbling-blocks, if I may so call them, which tend to\nprevent many of our possible coadjutors from adventuring them\nselves on the new illimitable road.\n\fPresident's Address. 355\nI see no good reason why any man of scientific mind should shut\nhis eyes to our work, or deliberately stand aloof from it. Our\nProceedings are of course not exactly parallel to the Proceedings of a\nSociety dealing with a long-established branch of Science. In every\nform of research their must be a beginning. We own to much that is\ntentative, much that may turn out erroneous. But it is thus, and\nthus only, that each Science in turn takes its stand. I venture to\nassert that both in actual careful record of new and important facts,\nand in suggestiveness, our Society's work and publications will form\nno unworthy preface to a profounder science both of Man, of Nature,\nand of \" Worlds not realised \" than this planet has yet known.\n\f\fEdmund Ourney Library. 357\nEDMUND GURNEY LIBRARY.\nSUPPLEMENTARY CATALOGUE, 1896.\nAdditions since the list in \"Proceedings,\" Vol. XI.\nBramwell (J.
