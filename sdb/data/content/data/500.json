There were also present : Professor C. D. Broad, Mrs\nGoldney, Sir Lawrence Jones, Bart., the Hon. Mrs Alfred Lyttelton,\nG.B.E., Miss I. Newton, Mr G. Redmayne, Mr W. H. Salter, Mr S. G.\nSoal and Admiral the Hon. A. C. Strutt ; also Mr Kenneth Richmond,\nEditor of the Journal, and Miss E. M. Horsell, Assistant-Secretary.\nThe Minutes of the last Meeting of the Council were read and signed\nas correct. One new Member was elected ; her name and address are\ngiven above.\nANNUAL REPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR 1942\n(1) General. To the war-time difficulties mentioned in the Annual\nGeneral Reports of the last three years must be added restrictions on paper\nwhich have seriously curtailed the amount of matter which can be printed\nin either the Proceedings or the Journal.\n(2) Research. Notwithstanding this and other troubles, much useful\nresearch work has been done.\n{a) Mr Richmond reports as follows : The group of percipients work-\n\f2 Journal of Society for Psychical Research jan.-feb. 1943\ning for the Precognition Committee has met regularly at the S.P.R. rooms,\nand thanks are due to its members for giving their time in a period when\nleisure is not plentiful. The results of the experimental work in which\nthey are engaged have illustrated, so far, the elusive character of \" psi\n\"\nphenomena (E.S.P.) when an attempt is made to induce these to follow\na prescribed course, and while the technique employed has elicited some\nnew and interesting effects in the field of paranormal cognition\u2014effects\nextensively confirmed by similar findings on Mr Carington's re-examining\nthe results of work previously done upon the paranormal cognition of\ndrawings\u2014the attempt to isolate a precognitive effect has not hitherto in\nthese experiments met with success. Experimental work is continuing\nwith a view to exploring the nature of the new effects and at the same\ntime extending the field of search for evidence for precognition.\nIn the summer of 1942 the Society had the opportunity of investigating\na number of cases in which painful conditions due to physical causes had\nbeen relieved, temporarily or permanently, after treatment of a psychical\nnature from which suggestion, verbal or other, was to a great extent\neliminated. The collected statements of patients and witnesses having\nshown a prima facie case for medical investigation, this process of the\nrelief of pain has now been under weekly observation for some months at\n3 1 Tavistock Square or in the consulting room of a surgeon who is kindly\ngiving regular co-operation in the exact verification of results. These are\nof distinct interest and include especially the relief of painful and stiffened\njoints in conditions where such an effect would be well outside medical\nexpectation. It is hoped that further observation may throw some light\nupon the circumstances, other than those favourable or unfavourable to\nsuggestion, which affect the incidence and the duration of relief.\n{b) The Council have renewed for another year, till 29 Sept. 1943, the\ngrant in favour of the \" Cambridge Committee \". Mr Whately Carington\nhas continued his researches on the Paranormal Cognition of Drawings.\nBetween twenty and thirty independent experimenters have now used the\ntechnique recently evolved, with very satisfactory results. This technique\nhas also been regularly used by Mr Richmond in the experiments on pre-\ncognition, and by Mrs Frank Heywood in a successful series of experi-\nments conducted by correspondence with a group of private percipients.\nPerhaps the most interesting point that has recently emerged is that,\nwhen a packet of folded slips of paper, each bearing the name of an object,\nis supplied to a sub-experimenter, from which the latter selects at random\na certain number for actual illustrations as originals, percipients score\nsignificantly high on the objects named on the unused slips, though not,\nin general, so high as on those actually drawn and used. This was first\nnoted in connection with Mr Richmond's experiments, and confirmed by\nseveral of Mr Whately Carington's own experiments.\nIn Experiment IX, also, the effect was tried for the first time of using\noriginals drawn in different colours, and there are strong indications that\npercipients score more freely on originals drawn in red or green than on\nthose drawn in black.\nA large scale experiment conducted by Dr Gardner Murphy and the\nAmerican S.P.R. is in process of analysis.\nUnfortimately, difficulties of paper shortage, etc. have precluded the\n\fJAN.-FEB. 1943 Annual Report 3\npublication of this work in full, but it is hoped to publish an abbreviated\nProgress Report in Proceedings shortly.\n{c) During the summer of 1942 Mrs Goldney and Mr Soal continued\nthe experiments in Precognitive Telepathy with Mr B.S. and further\nresults of striking interest were obtained. The arduous task of statistical\nevaluation and discussion of data has now been completed. It is hoped\nthat a report on this interesting and important work will shortly appear in\nProceedings.\n(d) In preparation for the F. W. H. Myers Memorial Lecture, which he\ndelivered in October, Mr Tyrrell has submitted to a thorough re-\nexamination the early work of the Society in regard to apparitions as set\nout in Phantasms of the Living and the Report on the Census of Hallu-\ncinations. The Lecture will be published shortly.\n{e) Notwithstanding difficulties of travel spontaneous occurrences in\nvarious parts of the country have been investigated. The Council would\nbe glad if members would keep a sharp look out for Press reports of\nhauntings, poltergeists, apparitions, premonitions etc., and investigate\ncases occurring in their own neighbourhood ;\nthey would find the advice\nof the officers of the Society helpful. The Council would also be glad\nif members would bring to the notice of the officers cases they were not\nthemselves able to investigate.\n(3) Financial Position. The income from subscriptions has been well\nmaintained as compared with the previous year, in fact it shows a small\nbut welcome increase. Sale of publications has also brought in a larger\namount. A saving has been effected in the cost of printing, partly because\nthe cost of an important paper to be published in Proceedings will be\nincurred in 1943, and not 1942 as originally intended. On the adverse\nside the rent for the tenancy of the upper part of the building is, as was\nforeseen, less and rates show a substantial increase. There has further\nbeen an exceptional item of expenditure in the cost of gift books for the\nForces, mentioned in paragraph 6. In accordance with the provisions of\nthe Deed of Trust for the Endowment Fund the Council adopted a reso-\nlution authorising the Trustees to make contribution to General Expenses\nfrom any surplus income in that Fund. This has been done to the extent\nof ^\\']% as compared with the \u00a3120 contributed in the previous year for\ncost of printing.\nThe year ends with a somewhat larger balance in hand which, in the\ndifficult circumstances prevailing owing to the war, the Council consider\nto be a satisfactory result, particularly in view of the expenditure of\n^70 IIS. 3d. for gift books for the Forces- mentioned above.\nThe Endowment Fund has continued to assist the Cambridge experi-\nments and has further financed in conjunction with the Blennerhassett\nTrust the experiments in precognition, mentioned in paragraph 2 (a). It\nends the year with a balance in hand of \u00a3110 17s. lod. more than the\nprevious year.\nAs far as can be foreseen the prospect for the coming year is that, pro-\nvided the measures of economy now in force are maintained, the work of\nthe Society will be capable of being carried on without having to trench\nupon reserves ; some extra expenses will be incurred but it is hoped that\nthese will be met from our present sources of income.\n\fX CO ' ' o o ' '\no CO o cr. t--\nrH\nO CO c o O CO :0 i-HCO\n1-1 CO oo O O I> ^ CO\nOCX) O (>1 rH\n5 lO CC\noc;\n3 X CO C.

Dr R. H. Thouless, whose work in psychical research is\nwell known, was elected President for the year. His Presidential Address,\nwhich was delivered on the ist May 1942, has been published in Pro-\nceedings.\n(5) Mrs Goldney has been co-opted a member of Council.\n(6) Books for H.M. Forces. An appeal by a former member of the\nSociety for books for a Mobile Library under her charge met with such a\ngenerous response from our members, and the books proved so welcome,\nthat the Council decided to have part of the Society's surplus stock of\nProceedings bound and issued, with a brief Introduction, to the Libraries\nprovided for men and women of the three Services. A set of three\nvolumes was made up consisting of material which would not be too\ntechnical for a reader having no specialised knowledge, and which would\ngive a comprehensive and impartial view of psychical research. Fifty\ncopies of Vol. I and seventy-five each of Vols. II and III were presented.\nIn addition Messrs Bell & Co. kindly arranged to print in paper covers 50\ncopies of each of the books in the series on Psychical Experiences recently\npublished by them, the authors agreeing to forego their royalties to this\nextent. It is hoped that these books will not only provide interesting\nreading for members of H.M. Forces during the war, but will encourage\nthem to make a serious study of psychical research when they return to\ncivil life, and that they will make the Society's work better known to\nsections of the public not ordinarily reached by the Society's publi-\ncations.\n(7) Library. Fifty-eight members borrowed books during the year and\n56 books were borrowed by the National Central Library. Members also\navailed themselves of the privilege of borrowing a number of books from\nthe National Central Library.\n(8) Obituary. Among the losses by death during 1942 may be nien-\ntioned : Sir Francis Younghusband, The Earl of Selborne, Lady Butt,\nMr J. A. Spender, and Canon F. W. Cooper ; some of them were members\nof very long standing.\n(9) Membership of the Society. Thirty new Members and one Student-\nAssociate were elected. The total loss from deaths, resignations, and other\ncauses is 18 Members and 7 Associates, leaving a net increase of 6 in the\ntotal membership of the Society, which now stands at 582.\n(10) Publications. One Part of Proceedings was published during the\nyear (Part 166) in September.\nThe Secretary's sales to the general public amount to ^^13 19s. 8d., and\nto Members of the Society ^46 6s. lod. and through the Society's Agent\nin the United' States, j^ii 9s. 4d., a satisfactory increase of ^^29 over last\nyear's sales.\n(11) Meetings. The following Meetings have been held during the year :\n25 Feb. Annual General Meeting.\n\" The Work of the Precognition Committee \", by Mr Kenneth\nRichmond.\n25 Mar. \" A Psycho-Therapist's View of Telepathy and Mediumship \",\nby Dr H. J.

Tyrrell.\n* General Meetings.\nEXPERIMENTS IN THE RELIEF OF PAIN\nThe experimental work mentioned in the Annual Report above (Section\nza, 2nd paragraph) will be helped forward, and sufferers may gain relief,\nif members can send any cases known to them of painful conditions which\ncan definitely be classed as arising from physical causes ; if possible,\npatients should be able to visit the Society's rooms at 6.30 p.m., but other\narrangements can be made in special cases.\nPROPOSED MEETINGS FOR DISCUSSION\nA LETTER in the following terms has been circulated by Mr Tyrrell to\ncertain members of the Society :\n\" The value of discussion as a means for promoting understanding and\nstimulating interest in a subject is now widely recognised, and it has been\nsuggested that periodical meetings for discussion might be welcomed by\nmembers of the S.P.R. and their friends.\n\" There are difficulties in the way of holding such discussions in war\ntime, and before steps are taken to realise the proposal, the opinion of\nmembers is desired : it would also be necessary to know approximately\nthe number of attendances that might be expected at each meeting. In\nthe event of the project being realised, meetings would be held in the\nevenings, say, once a fortnight, in the Society's Rooms at 31 Tavistock\nSquare, and the discussions, although informal, would be conducted by\na chairman, who would, as a rule, be a member of Council, or one of the\nolder members of the Society.\n\"It is thought that, by discussing some definite aspect of psychical\nresearch on each occasion, members, and those of their friends who are\ninterested, would come to appreciate more fully the problems which the\nS.P.R. is trying to solve, its policy and methods, and the wider significance\nof the subject as a whole.\n\" If the suggestion appeals to you, it would be appreciated if you would\ninquire among your friends and let me know how many, on an average,\nyou think you could bring to a fortnightly discussion. Also the tirfte which\nwould be most generally convenient.\"\nAny Members or Associates who are interested in this proposal are\ninvited to communicate with Mr G. N. M. Tyrrell, c\/o S.P.R., 31 Tavi-\nstock Square, W.C. i.\n\fJOURNAL OF THE\nSOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH\nfor Private Circulatmi amongst Members and Associates only\nMarch-April, 1943 \u2022\nVol. XXXIII\u2014No. 592-593\nCONTENTS\nPAGE\nNew Members - - - - - - - -10\nMeetings of the Council - - - - - - -10\nAnnual General Meeting - - - - - - - n\nObituary - - - - - - - - -11\nA Note Concerning the Nature of Paranormal Awareness 13\nReviews - - - - - - - - - -13\nA PRIVATE MEETING OF THE SOCIETY\nwill be held in\nThe Society's Library,\n31 Tavistock Square, London, W.C. i\nON\nWednesday, 26th May, 1943, at 4 p.m.\nWHEN A PAPER ON\nTHE THEORY OF PARANORMAL COGNITION\nAND ALLIED PHENOMENA \"\nwill be read by\nMr W.

H. Price\nfrom a letter written by him in the course of discussion on some experi-\nmental results observed by the Precognition Committee. His remarks\narose from a particular problem of discrimination between effects classi-\nfiable as \" precognitive \" and \" clairvoyant \" ; but the point of view which\nhe here describes has a general as well as a particular application, and is\nperhaps insufficiently considered when we endeavour to classify para-\nnormal events under the headings of this and that psychical \" faculty \".\nThis point arises, in another aspect, in an article by the President\n{Experiments in Paranormal Guessing) noticed on p. 15.\n\u2014\nEd.\n\" The more I consider clairvoyance, the less I seem to understand it!\nI begin to think it is really more puzzling than precognition itself. But\npart of the trouble is, I expect, that we use the one word '\nclairvoyance\n'\nto cover several different phenomena. The clairvoyant who '\nsees '\nghosts\nor spirits in the room in which he is seems very different from the one\nwho '\nsees '\ncontemporary objects many miles away, with or without the\naid of a crystal, and he again seems different from the psychometrist (if\nyou count him as a clairvoyant) who '\nsees '\nlong-past events associated\nwith a present object. Finally, the clairvoyant who '\nsees '\nauras sur-\nrounding the people in front of him seems different again, and his per-\nformances might perhaps be explainable in terms of ordinary physical and\nphysiological optics. But I see that I have forgotten the man who '\nsees\n'\nthe contents of sealed envelopes and parcels, or the underneath cards in\na pack. He seems to be different again. Leaving out the seer of auras,\nthe others seem to have in common only the negative characteristic of\nbeing freed from the limitations of ordinary sense-perception.\n\" If there is any one theory to cover the whole lot, I think it will have\nto be on Bergsonian lines. We shall have to change the question, and\npuzzle ourselves not about clairvoyance, but rather about normal sense-\nperception, treating it not as '\nnormal ', but rather as a sub-normal and\nbiologically-explicable limitation imposed upon an inherent and aboriginal\nomniscience. We shall have to say (as Leibniz did) that in principle\nevery mind is aware of what is going on everywhere ; and then the puzzling\nthing will be that in most people at most times this awareness is repressed\n\u2014which puzzle we then solve by invoking Bergson's attention a la vie\nwith the brain and physical sense-organs as its instrument.\n\" If this is indeed the right line to take, we ought not to expect to get\nlight upon the modus operandi of clairvoyance (or indeed other super-\nnormal cognition) from experiments. For it will not have any particular\nmodus operandi, being so to speak the natural and inherent condition of\nthe psyche. What we must seek light on is the manner or manners in which\nthe ordinary processes of sense-perception and everyday consciousness\nare switched off\u2014a question of '\nmodus inhibendi '\nrather than of '\nmodus\noperandi '. It is as if we were experimenting not on vision but on methods\nof temporarily curing blindness\u2014or again (if you prefer another analogy)\nmethods of temporarily cleaning the slate or the mirror. But actually we\n\fMAR.-APR. 1943 Paranormal Awareness\nhave tended to regard clairvoyance as an extra '\nsense '\n\u2014parallel in prin-\nciple to sight or hearing\u2014and then we naturally ask ourselves how it\nworks, just as the physiologist asks himself how ordinary sight or hearing\nworks. We ought to have asked not how works, but how the '\nde-\ninhibiting '\nfactors work, which sometimes allow the data it provides to\nreach the upper levels of consciousness. (Philosophers sometimes say that\nit is wrong in principle to seek for a causal explanation of '\nrational '\nor\n'\nvalid '\nthinking. What requires a causal explanation is erroneous or\ninvalid thinking\u2014which indeed is not really thinking at all, but the tem-\nporary cessation or inhibition of it.)\"\nREVIEWS\nAn Anatomy of Inspiration. By Rosamond E. M. Harding, Ph.D., Litt.D.\nHeffers, pp. xiii + 145, 7s. 6d.\nIn the Preface to this interesting book Dr Harding explains that her\nobject is \" to classify the enormous amount of historical data that exists\nrelating to the '\nmind in creation '\n\", as a first step to providing \" a solid\nbasis from which to start specialised enquiry \" into the working of the\ncreative mind in literature, art, music and scientific discovery. Her main\nsources are the statements of the authors themselves, and other contem-\nporary records.\n\" It is important \", she says, \" to recognise that there is a definite tech-\nnique ; a clearly marked '\npath '\nwhich is common to all types of creative\nthought.\" The principal stages are : (i) preparation by specialised study\nof the particular subject-matter and its appropriate technique, and by\ngeneral reading and reflexion : (2) the spontaneous and uncontrollable\n\" flash \" of inspiration, or, in the case of longer works, series of \" flashes \",\noften accompanied by the feeling that the resulting work is not the author's\nown (lines 20-47 of Book IX of Paradise Lost are the locus classicus for\nthese two stages) :\n(3) after an interval, expansion, revision and comple-\ntion. But within this general framework there are, as Dr Harding's\ninstances show, notable divergences. With some authors the whole work\nseems to be \" given \" and is unreservedly accepted without later revision ;\nthis is more commonly true of short poems than of longer compositions,\nthough George Sand sent off her novels to the publishers just as they were\nwritten, without any attempt to revise them. Others deliberately try to\ninduce fresh \" flashes \" for the purposes of completion. Others again\ncomplete by conscious effort in a normal state. A few proclaim an entire\ndistrust of inspiration.\nIt is well known that many most inferior artists and authors have\nclaimed inspiration for their works, but it would be of interest to ascertain\nwhether, as regards the work of any particular man, those portions for\nwhich he claimed a special degree of inspiration were recognisably different\nfrom the remainder. Housman, whose account of his own methods of\ncomposition Dr Harding quotes, set an agreeable problem when he\nspecified one of his poems, two stanzas of which had come \" into his head\njust as they were printed ; a third stanza came with a little coaxing after\ntea ;\none more was needed but it did not come : I had to turn to and com-\n\fJournal of Society for Psychical Research mar.-apr. 1943\npose it myself, and that was a laborious business \". His readers were left\nto guess which stanzas were due to which process.\nInspiration may come at any time, but seems to be favoured by the stage\nof passing from sleep to full wakefulness, which also favours the perception\nof veridical \" phantasms \". Sleep, Dr Harding suggests, promotes in-\nspiration by facilitating fortuitous combinations of ideas already existing\nin the mind. Some of the ideas thus combining would be \" fringe-ideas\n\"\nthat have become associated with, though apparently irrelevant to, the\nideas on which attention has been focussed. Because of their apparent\nirrelevance the \" fringe-ideas \" are set aside by the waking judgment, but\nare never wholly excluded from the lield of consciousness. There is, on\nthis view, no need to call in the operation of the subconscious, as distinct\nfrom the subliminal, mind.\nDr Harding does not deal with the very curious subject of \" calculating\nboys \", which plays such a large part in the chapter on Genius in Myers's\nHuman Personality. The rapidity and accuracy with which boys, some\nof them of poor intelligence and little education, solved the problems set\nthem suggest the use of methods of reasoning quite different from those\nin general use. This has perhaps some bearing on the function of inspira-\ntion in the objective sphere of scientific discovery.\nIn literature, music and art, where the standards are subjective, the\nauthors frequently assert that their works are not their own, but come to\nthem from some external source. In Dr Harding's view this means that\nthe author externalises the compulsive force of artistic truth. For\nexample, a novelist having created a character, and lived in his thoughts\nwith that character for a long time, cannot make that character act contrary\nto his conception.\nIt may, however, be doubted whether this is a sufficient explanation of\nthe sense of external origin, and it is here that Dr Harding's theory is\ncramped by the limitation she has imposed on her work in excluding what\nshe styles \" occultism \". Where is the boundary to be drawn.? It is true\nthat the authors whom Dr Harding quotes seldom claim to identify the\nsource of their inspiration, and that, taken as a whole, their work has a\nhigher literary value than can be claimed for most automatic writing.\nBut some of the writers she quotes, e.g. Blake and Tennyson, are placed\ndefinitely on the \" occult \" side of the frontier by their claims to have\nbeen in contact with their dead friends. Nor must \" the affable, familiar\nghost \", who helped the Rival Poet of Shakespeare's sonnets, be forgotten.\nWhen once this arbitrary dividing line is crossed several problems arise\nwhich throw doubt on the sufiiciency of Dr Harding's explanation. There\nare, for instance, cases where persons normally devoid of literary inclina-\ntion or training have shown in automatic writing considerable literary\npowers : although some of the claims made for her may have been\nexaggerated, \" Patience Worth \" was a case in point. Then, to come to\nmore objective matters, there are the instances where an automatist has\nimparted information concerning verifiable facts outside her normal know-\nledge. It is to be hoped that Dr Harding's success in exploring the limits\nof her subject as defined in this book will encourage her to extend the\nbounds of her enquiry. W. H.

Glen Hamilton, M.D. Pp. xiv+292,\nillus., Macmillans (Canada), S4.00.\nAccounts have already been published in the Journal of the American\nS.P.R. and in Psychic Science of the sittings conducted by Dr Glen\nHamilton, a Canadian doctor of high standing, with the ectoplasmic\nmedium, Mrs Mary Marshall (\" Mary M \"), but a fuller account in book\nform, admirably illustrated by numerous photographs, is to be welcomed,\nDr Glen Hamilton did not live to complete the book, a task accomplished\nby his son, Mr J. D. Hamilton.\nAbout 1922 Dr Glen Hamilton formed a group for investigating a\nmedium, Elizabeth M., whose phenomena were telekinetic. In 1925 Mary\nM. began occasionally to attend the group, of which she became a regular\nmember in January 1928. From 1928 to 1934 she produced teleplastic\nphenomena not very unlike those occurring with Eva C, masses of white\nsubstance looking like cotton-wool, in which were embedded flat surfaces\nwith human faces or features on them : several of the faces closely resembled\nphotographs of real people, Spurgeon, Conan Doyle, Raymond Lodge.\n\" Throughout his work Dr Hamilton insisted upon contra-fraudulent\nconditions and it is not our purpose to dwell here on the question of fraud\nin psychical matters for the xtry good reason that fraud did not and could\nnot exist in the Mary M. experiments.\" This statement would carry more\nweight if there was anything to show that the authors realised that the\nother mediumships quoted as parallel to and confirmatory of Mary M.'s\nphenomena (Eva C, Kathleen Goligher, Rudi Schneider, \" Margery \")\nare one and all open to grave suspicion. Where phenomena are produced\nin a room \" kept continuously and absolutely dark, except for the free\nuse of red light whenever necessary \", in a circle of which another medium,\nbesides Mary M., was a regular member, the fullest description of the\nmeasures taken to prevent fraud is desirable. W. H. S.\nExperiments in Paranormal Guessing. ByR. H. Thouless. The British Jour-\nnal of Psychology (General Section), Vol. XXXHI, Part I, July 1942.\nThe President here reports on some simple but exactly observed experi-\nmental work in card-guessing, \" not to bring forward fresh evidence for\nthe reality of telepathy and related phenomena \" (this is taken as estab-\nlished), \" but rather to suggest a method of experimentation which may\neasily be reproduced by any psychologist wishing to test the matter for\nhimself \". In some of this work the ordinary pack of 52 plaving cards\nwas used and a system of \" regional \" scoring employed to take proper\naccount of displacement effects\u2014the \" region \" being the card ostensibly\naimed at and the group of cards on either side of it. The calculations of\nsignificance are clearly described and a table is given to facilitate the work\nof experimenters in assessing their results. A note (pp. 21-22 of the\narticle) on the attempt to discriminate between \" telepathy \", \" clairvoy-\nance \" and \" precognition \" is relevant to the subject of Professor Price's\ncommunication printed in the present Journal, p. 12. Dr. Thouless writes :\n\" There may not be different types of process. There may be only one\nprocess which does not have the exact restriction to present time and to\npresent sensory stimulation that is characteristic of the process of obtaining\nknowledge by ordinary sense-perception.\" K. R,\n\fi6 Journal of Society for Psychical Research mar.-apr. 1943\nThe Journal of Parapsychology. Vol. 6. No. 4. Dec. 1942.\nThe Editorial deals with \" The Progress of Parapsychology as a Univer-\nsity Study \", and in particular takes note of the difference in the academic\noutlook which could be taken as a basis of discussion by three exponents\nof psychical research, all holders of the S.P.R. Presidency : William James,\nWilliam McDougall and Robert Thouless. The acceptance of our subject\nas a branch of scientific study has become a fact of observation. Mr Gerald\nHeard, in \" Some of the Convergences which Initiated Parapsychology \",\nconsiders the type of change in the intellectual climate of the present age\nwhich has made this acceptance possible. Convincing evidence can be\nin existence for a long time before opinion swings to the conclusion to\nwhich it points ; and the scale turns not only when the evidence reaches\na given mass, but when the facts begin to be seen as part of a coherent\norder. And for this, other facts have to converge into a system of com-\nprehension within which the new facts will make sense and become\nintegrated into an acceptable world-picture.\nMr Heard adduces not only the growing realisation of physical scien^ e\nthat \" the human mind was dealing with a universe which was demon-\nstrably extra-sensory \", as the material environment resolved itself into a\nnexus of mathematical energy-concepts ; the growth of a critical study\nreligious and mystical experience, the tendency of field work in anthr\npology to throw up evidence of paranormal processes, the increasing\nattention of the Western intelligence to records of Eastern wisdom\u2014all\nthese are convergent trends of open-mindedness, and Mr Heard cou i\nhave added more than he has taken space to consider about the influence\nof modern developments in psychology. He concludes with an interesting\nspeculation, derived from Bateson, that there may be a genetic reason\nfor the obscuration and recent re-emergence of psi-phenomena in Europe :\nthe fury of late medieval witch-hunting may have resulted in a widespread\nextermination of people with psychical capacities, so that the phenomena\nlargely disappeared and the age of witch-trials was succeeded by an age\nin which men blinked and wondered what all the fuss had been about.\nBut the nearly exterminated stocks would reassert themselves after a few\ngenerations, \" especially in those distant areas, the Scotch and Irish\nhighlands, where the Inquisition had never functioned effectively. Hence\nin the nineteenth century we should expect a steady increase in people\ncarrying this faculty \".\nExperimental work is represented in this issue by J. L. Woodruff and\nJ. B. Rhine's article, \" An Experiment in Precognition Using Dice \",\ndescribing a repeatable piece of research which could well be followed up\nby others, with due attention to the authors' careful treatment of possible\nsources of error ; and by William Russell and J. B. Rhine's experiments\non \" A Single Subject in a Variety of E.S.P. Test Conditions \". These\nshow a marked superiority of performance during \" Informal \" as against\n\" Formal \" tests, and add something to our data on the important question\nhow far scientific stringency lowers ostensibly positive results by being\naccurate, and how far it inhibits them by failure to preserve psychological\nease.

West\nThe main feature of these experiments was that the experimenter acted\nas his own percipient, making clairvoyant guesses and recording his own\nresults. The sole aim was a study of the mechanism at work. The\nexperiments were entirely exploratory, unwitnessed and unevidential\nwith regard to fraud.\nCard-guessing methods were used to establish the fact that the percipient\n^ Resume of a paper read at a Private Meeting of the Society on 14 April, 1943-\n\fMAY-JUNE, 1943 Account of Some Guessing Experiments 19\npossessed an extra-sensory faculty. Playing cards were employed, the\npercipient guessing their colour\u2014red or black. The percipient did his\nown shuffling, looking at the backs of the cards as little as possible, and\nintroducing a fresh pack every few hundred trials. The following is a\nsummary of the card-guessing methods :\n\" Ordinary \" Technique. A cut of about 30 cards was taken from the\npack and guessed through one by one. As each guess was made, the\nguessed card was lifted off and placed down on a left- or right-hand pile\naccording to whether it had been successfully guessed or not. A signifi-\ncant result was obtained. The outstanding objection to this method is\nthat, by adhering to a rigid system (noting which colour predominates in\nthe cards that have gone before, and guessing the opposite), it would\nbe possible to produce spurious deviations. Now, in some of the trials,\nthe cards were placed down in order in a row as they were guessed, the\n\" successes \" being somewhat displaced. This enabled the distribution of\nsuccesses to be noted at leisure afterwards. Examination of these trials\nshowed no indication of the percipient having adhered to any such rigid\nsystem, and a significant positive deviation, which could hardly have been\nspurious, was observed over just the first 15 cards of the cut. Moreover,\nlater trials were performed in which the cut guessed through was drawn\nfrom eight packs all shuffled up together. The rigid system could not\nassist here, yet scoring continued highly significant.\n\" Separate Pile \" Technique. The percipient endeavoured to separate\nthe pack into separate piles of red and black cards without looking at the\nfaces. When the full pack was separated out before checking no result\nwas obtained, but when a check was made every time a dozen or so cards\nhad been sorted a highly significant score was produced.\n\" Cutting \" Technique. The percipient would cut the pack at random\nand guess at the bottom card of the top cut. This card would then be\nremoved and a second cut and guess made. When about 20 cards had\nbeen removed they were replaced and the pack reshuffled. More trials\nwere performed, replacing and reshuflling every time 10 cards had been\nremoved. Very significant results were obtained.\n\" Down Through \" Technique. The percipient guessed the order of the\ncolours down through a shuffled pack, all 52 guesses being recorded in\nwriting before checking. Result significant.\nAll the methods produced positive results, viz. : \u2022\nDescription of Method N D CR\n\" Ordinary \" Technique - . . .\n4.570 298 871\n,, ,, (cut taken from 8 packs) 2,000 129 577\n\" Separate Pile \" Technique (fuU pack) -\n3,016 -6\n,, ,, ,, (approx. a doz. cards) 1,000 90 570\n\" Cutting \" Technique - . . - 3>05o 120 4-35\n,, ,, (reshuffling after 10 cards) 2,500 190 7-60\n\" Down Through \" Technique - - -\n1,508 59 3-04\nTotal - - - .\n17,644 880 13-25\n\f20 Journal of Society for Psychical Research may-june, 1943\nThe \" cutting \" technique and \" down through \" technique seem fairly\nprotected against hyperaesthesia, memorising of card backs and so on. The\nmain weakness is the possibihty of sensory leakage during shuffling. The\nshuffling was thorough, and performed as far as possible without the per-\ncipient looking at the card backs. Moreover, with some of the \" ordinary\n\"\ntechnique trials, in which the guessed cards were drawn from 8 packs\nshuffled together, the cards used were new to the percipient and some-\none else did the shuffling. Even so, a statistically significant result was\nobtained. Later precognitive trials gave confirmatory results when\nsensory leakage was a physical impossibility. It therefore seemed well\nestablished that E.S.P. was at work, and fairly safe to assume for compara-\ntive purposes that all the positive results were produced by E.S.P.\nRates of scoring varied with the different card-guessing methods. The\naverage deviation per hundred trials was 6. But any interruption of the\nquick smooth flow of guesses, as when each trial was recorded individually\nin writing, lowered this scoring rate considerably. High scoring methods,\n(8-9), corresponded to those the percipient found most interesting.\nThe \" down through \" method gave a low score (3), apparently because\nit did not allow of guesses being checked immediately one by one.\nPrecognitive methods were employed as follows :\nCutting Technique. Same as before, except that the guess was made\nbefore cutting the pack\u2014i.e. foretelling the result of a cut. The pack\nwas reshuffled after every 10 trials. The result was significant (N = 25oo,\n0 = 187, CR = 7-48). It was conceivable that the pack was being cut in\npositions predetermined by E.S.P., but efl^orts were made to make the\ncutting as \" haphazard \" as possible.\nDoivn Through Technique. As before, except that the pack was shuffled\nafter guessing and before checking\u2014i.e. foretelling the result of a shuffle\n\u2014result was significant, but low scoring. (N=4024, D=98, CR = 3-i).\nHere again it was conceivable that an E.S.P. shuffle was occurring, the\ncards being manipulated towards the guessed order.\nMechanical Shuffler Trials. As a final answer to the problem of clair-\nvoyant pseudo-precognition as opposed to true precognition, a mechanical\nshuffler was constructed. In essence it consisted of a vertical tube down\nwhich were passed red and black balls. Small paddle wheels revolving\nwithin the tube at about 3000 revs.\/min., with associated baffles, effected a\nthorough shuffle. The balls were then guided on to sloping rails, down\nwhich they ran in single file. The percipient would try to foretell the order\nof the first ten balls to arrive at the bottom. The statistics were compli-\ncated by the fact that only a limited number of balls were fed into the\nmachine. However, the percipient succeeded in foretelling the order\ncompletely correctly a larger number of times than would be expected\nfrom chance. A highly conservative estimate gave the associated pro-\nbability as -015.\nForetelling the casts of an unbiassed die also yielded significant results\n(see later). True precognition might thus be said to be confirmed.\nThe clairvoyant and precognitive \" cutting \" techniques were alternated\nover 5000 trials\u201410 precognitive guesses followed by 10 clairvoyant\nguesses throughout the series. A graph was plotted showing deviation\nover preceding 250 trials against number of trials completed, for the\n\fMAY-JUNE, 1943 Account of So7ne Gtiessitig Expermenis 2i\ntwo types of guesses. The scoring over the precognitive and clairvoyant\ntrials was thus demonstrated to be closely approximated in magnitude,\nand the variations were obviously closely correlated (r = 715, with p = -02,\nby method in Fisher, p. 202). Factors causing the variations must have\nbeen atfecting both \" types \" of E.S.P. similarly. The deviation per 250\ntrials in each case varied between about 27 and 10 in what was almost a\nrhythmic cycle. If these cycles were not just chance configurations and\nreally corresponded to some genuine rhythmic manifestation, the inter-\npretation is difficult, since the 5000 trials were distributed in an irregular\nmanner over a large number of sittings.\nThe most interesting observations of all were some curious variations\nin mode of extra-sensory manifestation, apparently correlated with\nchanges in psychological conditions. To investigate the normal mode of\nresponse, the distribution of runs was examined over those trials with the\n*'\nordinarv \" technique in which the guessed cards were placed down in\norder for future reference. Taking into account the fact that the prob-\nability of success has been altered by the E.S.P., the following table shows\na significant deficit of runs of failures against what would be expected from\na chance distribution of the successes.\nNo. of Expected Observed Expected Observed\nconsecutive frequency of frequency of frequency of frequency of\ntrials in run successful runs successful runs runs of failures runs of failures\n5 17-58 7\n6 67-0 93 6-12 I\n7 39-9 56 2-63 0\n-8 24-3 32\nApparently the E.S.P., when working normally, was working specifically\nto inhibit runs of failures. In other words, the production of a positive\ndeviation was not its primary concern.\nInterspersed among the later precognitive \" down through \" trials\nwere more trials in which there was a variable delay between recording\nof guesses and shuffling and checking the pack. Result, N = 1040,\nD=34, CR = 2-i. Though possibly due to chance, it seems more likely\nthat psychological bias was causing a tendency to negative scoring.\nThe effect of fatigue was investigated on two occasions by performing\n1000 \" ordinary \" trials at a single sitting. Rate of deviation was plotted\ngraphically against number of trials completed. On both occasions it\nwas found that there was an initial high rate of scoring, coming quickly\ndown to an average value, which declined slowly. After about 400 trials\nthe scoring began to decline rapidly. When it reached zero it did not stop\nthere but \" declined \" further, finally producing a steady negative rate of\nscoring of about the same magnitude as the previous positive rate. The\nexperimenter felt that this might have been a psychological mechanism\ntending to arrest a distasteful experiment by neutralising the score.\nThe effect of interest has already been noted. A. psychological attitude\nof great confidence produced startling results. One black card was placed\namong 26 reds and the percipient went through the 27 cards over and over\n\f22 Journal of Society for Psychical Research may-june, 1943\nagain, turning over only those he felt sure were red. The aim was to\nleave the black to the very end, and so effect a separation of a given card\nfrom 26 others. Extraordinary successes were obtained by this method,\nwhich was designed to give the percipient confidence. On the first\noccasion on which it was tried, out of 8 sets of 27 cards, the black was\nleft to the last 6 times, and turned up next to last in the other two.\nOn another occasion, 13 blacks were successfully separated from 52 reds\nby a similar process. However, the phenomenon was only transient.\nArrangements for witnessing were made, but by the time the date for the\nwitness trials arrived the scoring had fallen to chance level. This method\nwas the weakest as far as the possibility of sensory leakage, but it worked\nsuccessfully with brand-new cards. The result would suggest that the\nE.S.P. capacity possesses unsuspected latent capacity, ready to show itself\nunder appropriate (psychological?) conditions.\nArrangements were made to have the \" ordinary \" technique witnessed\nunder stringent conditions. Attempts made before several witnesses\nproduced no definite result. Yet when exactly the same technique was\nperformed \" unofficially \" before these same witnesses, it succeeded as\nusual. We are forced to conclude that the psychological effect of the\nknowledge of the significance of the particular trials in question was the\ninhibiting factor.\nA curious effect occurred in the precognitive dice trials, when the\npercipient guessed the number (1-6) which would result from the cast\nof a die. First, 1410 trials were completed, with a customary positive\nresult (D = +32, p = -o2). The next trials were officially witnessed with\napparently no result. Further trials were completed after the witnessed\nexperiment, but still with no significant deviation. (Altogether N = 1590,\nD =-15). These curiously \" affected \" trials were then split up into con-\nsecutive groups of 6 trials each and the frequency distribution of different\ndegrees of success in these groups was examined.\nNo. of successes in group 0 I 2 3, 4, 5 and 6\nObserved frequency 105 84 64 12\nExpected frequency 8872 106-5 53-26 16-52\nDeviation + 16-28 -22-5 + 10-74 -4-52\n= 1 1 -\n14. p = approx. o-\n1\nThe distribution showed a significant extra-chance effect. There was\na deficit of groups containing exactly chance expectation of one success,\nand an excess of other groups. This is what one would expect were the\nE.S.P. having a sort of tug-of-war with itself, producing positive and\nnegative scoring anternately.\nAll these bizarre forms of E.S.P. manifestation appeared to correspond\nto psychological factors. The conclusion would seem to be that the E.S.P.\nwas more powerful than the customary meagre rates of card scoring would\nsuggest, but that psychological factors were making it perform other tasks\nthan the mere production of positive scores.\n\fMAY-JUNE, 1943 . Review > .\n23\nREVIEW :\nThe Psychic Sense. By Phoebe Payne and Laurence J. Bendit. Faber\nand Faber. 7s. 6d. net.\nThe primary object of this Uttle book is to show that those innate\nperceptions, variously called \" psychic \", \" supernormal \" or \" extra-\nsensory \", with which a few people are gifted in marked degree, but which,\nin reality, are in some degree possessed by all, should be frankly recognised,\nshould be utilised by psychologists and allowed for in education. More-\nover, the book offers good and kindly advice to the possessors of such\nfaculties regarding their training and management. To those who, like\nMiss Phoebe Payne, live in the exercise of a highly developed faculty of\nthis kind, the scepticism of the world must seem peculiarly absurd and\nirritating ;\nyet she and her co-author show themselves uniformly tolerant\ntowards all points of view.\nIn a book intended for the general pubHc, it would, perhaps, have been\nbetter to have adhered to this main object and to have avoided the per-\nplexing problems raised by psychic and psychological mechanisms.\nAdmittedly any attempt to understand extra-sensory perception will, in\nthe end, carry us out of our intellectual depth ; the more reason, therefore,\nfor retaining absolute clarity of thought as far as we can go. In no subject\nis clear thinking more important than in psychical research. Nowhere\nelse is care in the use of terms, or criticism in coming to conclusions,\nmore necessary ; for metaphysical problems cluster around us. Dis-\nciplined thought should be maintained until the point is reached when we\ncan no longer grasp the ideas demanded of us. Even then, at the end of\nour tether, we may, if we are careful, be able to note the direction of the\nsignposts pointing into the unknown. But the authors of this book have\nshort-circuited at once the difficulties and the hope of enlightenment by\nassuming the literal reality of the psychic's descriptions of his experiences.\n\" Clairvoyant investigation \", they say for example, \" tends to suggest\nthat the psyche does, in fact, occupy space and is a structure consisting\nof energy-matter.\" (page 25).\n\" Auras \", \" etheric bodies \" and other\nkinds of sense-imagery experienced by the psychic, appear to be accepted\nliterally and assumed to consist of some kind of matter. Even mind is\nreduced to a material thing! \" The clairvoyant investigator\", they say,\n\" considers the mind as a thing, as a three-dimensional body which moves\nfrom place to place.\" (p. 102). And what is the reader to make of the\nstatement that the \" psychic world \" is \"a material but non-physical\nregion \".?\n(p. 28). This naivety and laxity of statement and argument\nis inimical to all real progress ; moreover it causes trained minds to turn\naway from the subject. Let it be granted that the ultimate causes of the\nsensitive's experiences are real features in a real world ; it does not\nfollow that the imagery in terms of which these experiences are expressed\nis to be taken literally. The imagery may be supplied by the sensitive\nhimself : for this there is ample precedent. Neither the sensitive's feeling\nthat a supernormal intuition has been separated from associated ideas and\nimagination, nor the fact that the imagery is generic, is sufficient proof to\nthe contrary. Veridicality is perfectly compatible with modes of expres-\nsion which are not to be taken at their face value. The task of probing\n\f24 Journal of Society for Psychical Research may-june, 1943\nfor entities and processes behind presentational forms is, indeed, precisely\nthe aim of psychical research. This is where psychical research begins\nand spiritualism ends. And the best starting-point for an inquiry into the\nprocesses of supernormal perception is surely the ground which philo-\nsophers have already prepared.\nAll this, however, does not detract from the value of the therapeutic\nwork, both in the physical and psychological fields, which Miss Payne\nhas accomplished ; nor from the value of the information regarding\npsychical powers in practical life which the present book sets before its\nreaders. G. N. M. T.\nWhat Lies Beyond? By A. M. Kaulback. Pp. 115. London. 1942.\nRider & Co. 7s. 6d.\nMrs Kaulback is the mother of the celebrated explorer of Tibet. This\nbook gives much of the evidence supporting her conviction that through\npsychic channels she was kept informed of his surroundings and adventures\nduring periods when he was far distant from any means of sending\nmessages by post or radio. The evidence is given in detail and includes\ndescriptions of the various means by which the information reached her.\nAlthough Mrs Kaulback had previously been familiar with the broad\nfact of communication with the discarnate, it was from the time of her\nhusband's death in 1929 that she had the advantage of his assistance in\nher psychical explorations and, somewhat later, gained the interest of an\nexperienced Control. This Control enabled her to achieve a form of\npsychic writing which kept her in close touch with the explorer son in his\ntravels and also with a soldier son then in distant lands.\nSometimes it would be an incident happening at the moment which the\nControl was able to visualise for her; at other times she received more\ngeneral descriptions of recent happenings. With regard to the latter it is\ninteresting to note that the Control occasionally mistook for an accom-\nplished fact something which had only existed as an intention in her son's\nmind. The Control's clairvoyance varied in accuracy from time to time\nas if influenced by conditions not always easy to discern.\nTwo chapters are devoted to experiments which brought final conviction\nthat a Control manifesting through different mediums could prove his\nidentity by \" cross-tests \".\nThe aim of the book is stated in its final pages and readers might with\nadvantage study this before taking the book as a whole. Briefly, the aim\nis to display \" evidence of the work done by those who are discarnate with\none who is incarnate \", and then to indicate the conditions essential for\nsuccess in such work.\nAs the authoress states her facts with clarity and considerable detail\nreaders can form their own conclusions. There would seem to be no\ndoubt that the mother was kept generally informed of the doings of her\ndistant sons. It will probably tax the ingenuity of sceptics to suggest\nany feasible explanation other than that asserted in the communications\nand confirmed by the recipient's repeated endeavours to test other\nhypothetical causes.\nHere is a book equally suitable for students of psychical research and\nfor those seeking evidence for the reality of intercourse with the departed.\nC.

Godwin Baynes, who contributed\nto the Society papers of considerable interest on psychical phenomena\nviewed from the standpoint of analytical psychology. Dr Baynes was\nfor a number of years Dr C. G. Jung's assistant at Zurich, and organised\nthe expedition for psychological exploration among African tribes from\nwhich he and Dr Jung derived interesting data about the workings of\nthe primitive mind. Of recent years Dr Baynes had been working as a\nconsultant in England. His writings were mainly devoted to analytical\npsychology ; a point of recent interest to students of psychical research\nhas been his suggestion that Hitler is of a morbid mediumistic type, giving\nexpression to an abnormal aggressive drive in the collective mind of\nGermany.\nWe also regret to record the death of Miss Radclyffe Hall, a former\nmember of the Council. In collaboration with (Una) Lady Troubridge\nshe carried out a very full investigation of Mrs Leonard, and made an\nimportant contribution {Proceedings, Part LXXVIII) to the study of her\nmediumship.\nWe also regret to record the death of Mr Hubert Wales, who contributed\nto Proceedings (Part LXXX) a report on a series of cases, which had come\nunder his own observation, of \"Apparent Thought-Transference without\nConscious Agency \".\nGIFT TO THE SOCIETY \\ i'\nThe Council has accepted with much gratitude a donation from Mr\nCharles E. Ozanne, whose letter we print below.\n1830 Nela Ave.,\nEast Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.A.\nMay 6, 1943.\nThe Society for Psychical Research\nGentlemen,\nI have been making a fairly substantial gift for the work of Psychical\nResearch, the larger part of which I have sent to Rhine at Duke Univer-\nsity, for whose widely extended efforts I have very great respect. Before\nmaking my final decision, I consulted Professor Gardner Murphy, for\n\fSEPT.-OCT. 1943 Case : Tivo Dreams 27\nwhose wide knowledge of the field and good judgment I have high regard.\nHe highly approved of the gift to Rhine, but added that if I could arrange\nit to send a contribution to your own work also, it would be a very desirable\nthing, and would help to strengthen the spirit of co-operation between\nAmerican and British scholars.\nOn thinking matters over, I heartily concur in his judgment, and count\nit a privilege by this gift to give concrete evidence of my appreciation of\nthe splendid record which the London Society has made. I am at present\ngiving a good deal of time to the study of Theosophy. We have there the\nstory of a quest carried on for the most part by sincere seekers, but by a\nmethod by which free rein is given to all sorts of fancies, and there is no\neffective check placed on the excesses of the imagination. I am deeply\nimpressed by contrast with the highly competent and scientific work\nwhich your society has carried on from the first days when Professor\nHenry Sidgwick helped to establish standards which won the respect of\nthoughtful people everywhere. Of that work I feel that I personally\nhave been a beneficiary, as have many other people the world over.\nI am sending a gift of approximately $500. I hope that this sum may\nassist you to some degree in the prosecution of your own research, and that\nit may carry a message of good-will and friendly co-operation from those\nwho are interested in these enormously important investigations across\nthe sea.\n. Sincerely yours,\n^\n. , Charles E. Ozanne\nA STEP IN THE\nRECOGNITION OF PSYCHICAL RESEARCH\nWe note with satisfaction the acceptance by the Faculty of Medicine at\nCambridge University of a thesis by Dr L. J. Bendit dealing with para-\nnormal perceptions as occurring in psychopathological states. This\nappears to be the first doctorate in medicine that has been given, at any\nrate in this country, for a thesis embodying the findings of psychical\nresearch, and we may congratulate Dr Bendit on his successful presenta-\ntion of the subject.\nCASE : TWO DREAMS APPARENTLY CONVEYING\nPARANORMAL IMPRESSIONS\nFor the following reports we are indebted to Mr Lawrence Nathan, of\n35 Armley Grove Place, Leeds 12, who states in a letter to the Assistant-\nSecretary that he has experienced \" various manifestations covering a\nnumber of years \", besides the two dream-impressions now communi-\ncated to the Society. Mr Nathan appears from the personal details which\nhe provides as a steady-going man, 42 years old, of good reputation with\nemployers, married since the age of 21. He notes that since his youth he\nhas always had profound faith in certain of his dreams ; not in all. In\ncertain instances, he writes, \" I know immediately on awakening that some\n'\nother power '\nhas communicated \".\n\f28 Jowual of Society for Psychical Reseai cJi sept.-oct. 1943\nMr Nathan writes as follows ^ in describing the first of the two experi-\nences reported to us :\n\" From 1929 until 1934 I was in business on my own account at Aber-\ndeen, Scotland. My father lived in that town from 1934 until 1936,\nwhen he died. I had left Aberdeen in September 1934. My father and\nI had not been on speaking terms since I left Aberdeen. We had never\ncorresponded during this time. I was in business in South Shields when\nmy father died. My father had been known as a strong, healthy, vigorous\nman. Illness was not his. He died at 57 years, on 7 February 1936, at\nabout, say, 8 p.m.\"\nWe may interpolate here that Mr Nathan subsequently wrote to the\nRegistrar of Deaths, Southern Aberdeen, to verify the time of death,\nand has sent us his letter of enquiry bearing upon the back the Registrar's\nofficial stamp and the following statement :\n\" The time of Death is given\nas 7.30 p.m. W. Hustwick, Registrar.\" Mr Nathan's report continues :\n\" At approximately 2 a.m. on the 8th of February, 1936, I awoke from\na deep sleep, awakened my wife, and told her that my father was dead.\nWhy was I so sure.' Because I had just '\nheard '\nmy father's mother\n(dead some 20 years) say to my Mother's mother (dead some 25 years),\n'\nJoe is coming to us ' \u2014' Joe '\nbeing the abbreviation for my father's\nname, Joseph. I not only '\nheard '\nthe speech, but I '\nsaw '\nboth my\ngrandmothers, very vividly. I know of course it was in my dream.\n\" During the day of the 9th, loth or iith of February 1936, a telegram\ncame to me from an aunt in Bradford, Yorks, asking me to come and see\nher, and stating that '\nsomething had happened '\nto my father. Please\nnote\u2014no official word of actual death yet. I learned of this over the\ntelephone from an uncle in Leeds some 2, 3 or 4 days afterwards. The\naunt in Bradford was my only relative who knew of my exact residence at\nthat time.\"\nMr Nathan adds in a subsequent letter to the Hon. Secretary that his\ntwo grandmothers lived in different towns and to his certain knowledge\nhad not seen each other for at least 20 years ; neither did they correspond.\n\" Yet \", he remarks, \" in my dream they seemed very closely allied and\nappeared to be in earnest conversation.\" In reply to the Hon. Secretary's\nrequest for any available corroboration, Mr Nathan encloses the Regis-\nfrar's statement quoted above, and regrets that he is not in possession of\nany relevant newspaper cuttings. He adds :\n\" But I certainly read a long\naccount of the affair, either in the Leeds '\nYorkshire Evening Post '\nor\n'\nNews '. I understand there was an account, also, in a Glasgow evening\npaper.\"\nIt will be remembered that Mr Nathan writes of having awakened his\nwife and told her that his father was dead, on waking from his dream ;\nhe does not say that he recounted the dream itself. Unfortunately Mrs\nNathan's memory does not enable her to give definite confirmation to the\nincident. Her statement is as follows :\n\" My husband has on very many occasions told me of his dreams. He\ncan also, with uncanny accuracy, interpret most of his dreams. With\n^ The account is here slightly abridged frorti the original statement in the Society's\npossession.\n\fSEPT.-OCT. 1943 Case : Two Dreams 29\nregard to the dream now in question ; I am a firm believer in absolute\nhonesty and truth. Therefore, I will not say that I can remember what\ndream my husband had in the early hours of the morning on the 8th\nJanuary, 1936 ;\nbut, I certainly have a hazy remembrance of such a dream\nas he appears to remember so well.\nAnne Nathan.\"\nMr Nathan explains that when Mrs Nathan speaks of his ability to\n\" interpret \" his dreams she is alluding to dreams of a telepathic and pre-\ncognitive kind which have for him the character of visions and are particu-\nlarly impressed on his memory as conveying some paranormal informa-\ntion. Mr Nathan further points out that his wife's inability to recollect\nthe incident clearly could well be explained by her being only just awakened\nfrom sleep in the early hours of the morning.\nThe second experience reported by Mr Nathan is not capable of real\nverification as a \" crisis \" dream comparable to a \" crisis \" hallucination ;\nbut there is a considerable body of evidence for telepathic impressions\nreceived in moments of crisis, and it may be worth while to study cases\nwhich appear to be of this character but in which, as in the present\ninstance, the impression seems to have been more or less distorted or\ndramatised into a different form. Assuming that telepathic impressions\ndo occur, we could expect that only a small minority of them would\n\" come through \" undistorted : and it should be useful to observe what\nkind of distortions seem to occur, and what kind of main impulse appears\nto show through the distortion. In this case a strong emotion of panic\ncaused by a fear of choking is the common feature between the dream\nreported by Mr Nathan and the actual experience of his baby son who\nwas at the time in a difTerent part of the country.\nMr Nathan records the occurrence as follows :\n\" Some years ago I was on holiday. I was visiting an aunt in Bradford,\nYorkshire. At that time my home was in Glasgow. My eldest son was\nwith me. The baby boy was in Glasgow with his mother. On a certain\nday in August, about 1926, we had just finished the mid-day meal, I was\novercome by a distinct desire for sleep. It was overpowering. I left my\naunt, uncle, two cousins and my eldest son in the dining room and went\nupstairs to sleep. It was exactly 2 p.m. I slept almost immediately.\nBy 2.15 p.m. I was again in the dining room. I told my relatives of the\npeculiar dream I had just experienced. It was so vivid that I puzzled\nmyself endeavouring to find a conscious meaning. At the time I could\nnot do so. However, on my return to Glasgow some 10 days later, my\nwife related to me that our baby boy had almost lost his life by suffocation.\nInstantly and without hesitation I said, '\nWait ', and I told her correctly\nthe day and the time of the catastrophe. It coincided absolutely with the\nday and the time of my dream. My wife was positively annoyed at my\nknowing, as she had refrained from writing to me any word of the above\nquoted incident.^\n\" At much the same time, I should say the identical time, as I dreamed,\nmy baby boy was eating potatoes and a piece lodged in his throat. It\n^ Corroboration here is not available ; this was the experient's first wife.\n\f30 Jounial of Society for Psychical Research sept.-oct. 1943\ntranspired that the obstruction was removed only in the nick of time. A\nfew more seconds and it would have proved fatal. So the Doctor, said.\nA Doctor lived across the road and the boy was rushed to him.\n\" I dreamed that I was back in Glasgow, I was walking. My desire\nto reach an unknown destination was very strong within me. I came to an\noverhead railway bridge which is in Nelson Street, Glasgow. As I was\npassing under the bridge a thick, black, dense smoke came rolling through\nthe archway towards me. I was determined to reach my destination, so I\npressed forward. The further I went on my way, the thicker became the\nsmoke, until I began to cough and choke. The choking sensation became\nso acute that I suddenly developed panic. My desire to go on was still\nstrong ; but I had a deeper, more intense feeling to '\nabout-turn '. So,\nprecipitately, I turned and ran for my life, out the way I had come. On\nagain reaching the light of day I awoke.\"\n(The study of dreams has led the present commentator to observe a\nrecurrent association of road and rail crossings\u2014and not of level crossings\nonly\u2014with ideas of danger to life : the association would be natural\nenough at childish and primitive levels of the mind. Dense black smoke\ncould be considered as combining an ostensible cause for a sensation of\nchoking with an impression of the physiological experience of suffocation,\nin which there is a progressive darkening of the field of vision until a\ncomplete \" black-out \" supervenes. Ed.\nREVIEWS\nThe Journal of Parapsychology. Vol. 7, Nos. i and 2, March and June\n1943-\nIn the reviewing of these two numbers chief attention must be paid to\nthree articles in which experimental evidence for telekinesis, obtained over\na long period and systematically observed and analysed, is now in part\npresented to research workers at large. Further publication is to follow,\npresenting successive instalments of the large quantity of significant data\nwhich are said to have been amassed. The three articles before us give\nsufficient basis for consideration of the surprising claim that emerges, and\nthe technique is one that can easily be repeated by other experimenters.\nThe writers, Professor Rhine and others, prefer to replace the term\n\" telekinesis \", for psycho-psychical action at a distance, by the term\n\" psychokinesis \" which, with the abbreviation PK, is used throughout\nthe papers under review. The emphasis is thus on the hypothesis of\npsycho-psychical action rather than on the observed fact of distance\nbetween the supposed mover and the thing moved. Also, past associations\nare avoided of the word \" telekinesis \" with ectoplasm and the various\nclaims of physical mediumship. The present experiments are of a very\ndifferent character.\nThe work started nine years ago, from an idea of method suggested by\nthe statement of a young man interested in gambling, that he and others\nbelieved they could influence the fall of dice by a mental effort. The\nthrowing of dice appeared to be an excellently simple method for experi-\nments that could be readily performed and repeated, and adequately\n\fSEPT.-ocT. 1943 Reviews .\n''\n31\nobserved. Here we should first consider the elementary possibilities of\nerror, which seem to resolve themselves into two : faulty dice having a bias\ntowards the throwing of this or that number, and conscious or unconscious\ntricks of throwing, by which preferred numbers might be caused to fall\nuppermost to an extent that would show a cumulative result against\nchance.\nThe authors observe that no dice can be absolutely perfect. With dice\nin which the \" pips \" are hollowed out in each of the six faces, the faces\nwith more \" pips \" are presumably lighter than those with less, though\napparently not to an extent that produces any observable effect on scoring.\nBut in these experiments the practical question, whether any bias in the\ndice can be affecting the results in a relevant way, seems to be correctly\nanswered in the negative by observation of the results themselves : in the\nsimplest instance, by the fact that with the same dice either high or low\nscoring is found to occur according to the intention of the thrower. It is\nnot stated whether the dice used had sharp or bevelled corners : supposing\nanything like a slight physical push or pull at the last moment to be\nexercised, it could be expected that the kind of die which rolls more easily\nwould show a higher proportion of positive results. Perhaps the point\nhas been tested in some of the experiments not yet published.\nThe question of presumable tricks of throwing is answered, in the\nsimplest instance (there are other answers, again from the nature of the\nresults), by a device which eliminates muscular propulsion of the dice :\nthey are released at the top of an inclined board upon which corrugated\npaper is fastened, so that they roll over and over on their way down the\nslope. This form of experiment is easy to repeat, and the board can be\nso arranged that the dice fall into an armchair, first bouncing against the\nback and then falling on to the seat. For release, the dice can rest against a\nruler placed across the top of the board on two nails, the ruler being lifted\nto let the dice go. It appears that dice \" thrown \" by this method give\npositive results of the same order as those produced by throwing from a\ndice-box, cup or other container ; and also produce scores which show a\nsimilar curious patterning. Results of the same order are also produced\nwhen as many as six dice are thrown, manually, at one time.\nThe most immediately interesting feature in the prevalent pattern of\nthe scoring is the phenomenon called, by the authors, \" decline \". Scoring\npersistently starts high (or low, when low figures are being aimed at) and\nthe positive scoring decreases, or declines, until past the middle of the\nprescribed series of throws, to rise again somewhat during the conclusion of\nthe run. Further, when a number of runs are recorded (in view of the\nthrower, it seems) in a series of columns filling up a sheet, a similar decline\nand recovery is apparent on examination of the scores both from top to\nbottom of each column and from beginning to end of the sheet. This is\nreasonably explained as in all probability a psychological effect dependent\non variation of interest and so of effective intention during the performance\nof a set task with its successive limits spatially represented\u2014as in the case\nof an amateur gardener planting or weeding a row, whose keenness on the\njob is strongest at the beginning of the row (and also of the whole job),\ndeclines up to and beyond the middle, and revives as he realises that the\nend is in sight. It will be seen that the \" decline \" effects noted in these\n\f32 Journal of Society for Psychical Research sept.-oct. 1943\nexperiments show kinship with the \" saHence \" effects that have been\nobserved in E.S.P. work.\nWhile these experimental findings have to encounter a stronger feeling\nof their antecedent improbability than those of E.S.P., it is argued that\nE.S.P. itself involves some degree of psycho-physical interaction, since it\nis a principle of physics that the act of observation entails some physical\naction upon the thing observed. Psychokinesis can thus be regarded as\nlogically coherent with E.S.P. : this argument assumes the reality of the\ndirect clairvoyance of physical objects and events, a class of phenomena\nwhich on Mr Carington's One Mind theory may be referable to the\ninteraction of minds only, or rather to their underlying indivisibility. Be\nthat as it may, the causative linkages between the mental aim adopted and\nthe actual fall of the dice observed in these experiments is difficult to\nconceive, and the first thing to do is to make careful study of the reports\nissued by Professor Rhine and his colleagues and to endeavour to repeat\ntheir experiments.\nThe Jotirnal of Parapsychology also contains, in its March number,\nan interesting study of patterned results in E.S.P. work, by Betty M.\nHumphrey ; a discussion by J. H. Rush of the difficulties of linking E.S.P.\nwith the concepts of physics ; cases quoted and discussed by Gardner\nMurphy to illustrate the relative credibility of telepathy from the dead or\nfrom the living as accounting for certain kinds of spontaneous hallucina-\ntion ; and a letter from the late H. F. Saltmarsh on the likelihood that a\nrhythmic effect may be prevalent in the emergence of E.S.P. into con-\nsciousness and may be concerned in the phenomenon of salience. In the\nJune number, A. A.

Tyrrell\nA request was recently received that a member of the S.P.R. might visit\nand investigate a house in the country, reputed to be haunted and unlucky.\nI undertook to visit the house, and went there on 28 October 1943,\naccompanied by Miss G. M. Johnson, who came with me as a possessor\nof extra-sensory faculty, in case sounds or other impressions which I\nmight miss should be received by her. Since it is considered that the\npublicity might adversely influence the value of the house to the owner if\nits whereabouts were known, all the names used below are fictitious.\nIn her first letter, addressed to the Secretary of the S.P.R., the present\ntenant of the house, Mrs Knight, said that she, with her sister. Miss Irwin,\nhad been in the house about three years, having rented it furnished in\n1940 from a widow, whose husband had died in the house suddenly.\nSoon afterwards this widow had had a bad cycling accident and had broken\nher arm, and she then decided to let it. Mrs Knight at this time was\nliving in a distant part of England and knew nothing whatever of the house\nor its history. She heard of it through her stepson, who went over to see\nit from a town three miles away, and she took it on the strength of a tele-\nphone conversation with him. No one told Mrs Knight anything about\nthe ill reputation of the house until August 1943, when she had been\nthere about three years and had had the following experiences of her own.\nIn the above letter to the Secretary, Mrs Knight said (the letter is here\nabbreviated) :\n\" There is some evil here, which manifests itself in illnesses,\nour visitors, resident maids, all seem to get ill and my husband died early\nin July last. . . . Other manifestations\u2014most notably from January 1943,\nare rappings, alarming noises such as might be made by an animal worrying\na big bone on bare boards, or a big parcel of books falling, unpleasant and\ninexplicable odours. My sister has twice awakened suddenly with a\nfeeling of hands round her throat trying to strangle her, and a sensation\nof an evil presence. Most of the noises have been heard by two people.\"\nOn our arrival, as Miss Johnson and I were walking from the 'bus\ntowards the house, we were met in the road by Mrs Knight, who said that\nshe had intended to meet us at the 'bus, but that her sister a few minutes\nago had fallen down in the house and broken her wrist ! We found Miss\nIrwin reclining on the sofa, her right wrist swollen and out of shape. The\ndoctor was sent for and splinted it temporarily. Later she was taken to\nhospital in a car and the wrist set under an anaesthetic. In the meantime\nshe pluckily told us about her experiences in the house. Miss Irwin's\naccount of her accident was that she was running along the hall to open\nthe front door to her sister when her heel slipped on the boards and she fell.\n\fNOV.-DEC. 1943 Case : Haunted House 35\nI examined the place. The hall carpet ended a foot short of the door-mat,\nleaving a space of bare board. The boards were old with a rather rough\nsurface, stained and floor-polished, but not highly polished, and they did\nnot appear to be slippery. But of course one may sHp and fall anywhere.\nThe house, which is No. 13, is situated in Meadow Lane, a secondary\nroad turning out of the main road which runs through the village of\nWhereham, which lies within a sixty mile radius of London. Meadow\nLane is fringed for some distance with small, detached houses, some quite\nnew and some older. No. 13 is a prosaic little two-storey house built of\nred brick with a slate roof and standing back some 25 feet from the road\nbehind substantial iron railings. It is rectangular in shape with a kitchen\nbuilt out at the back. The front door is in the middle with a bow window\non each side, while above are three windows in a row. At the back is a\nrectangular kitchen garden. The house is believed to be about 120 years\nold. Inside it is particularly light and cheerful, the fittings and decorations\nbeing quite modern. It is the last house which one would suspect of\nbeing haunted.\nMrs Knight and her sister told us freely of all their experiences, the\nmost important of which were noted down in Mrs Knight's diary at the\ntime, and this she kindly allowed me to inspect. On 27 August 1943, Mrs\nKnight's married sister, Mrs Fox, then in perfect health to all appearances,\ncame to stay at No. 13. Next morning she felt a pain in her back, and\nabout II a.m. was seized with a terrible internal pain. As soon as there\nwas a vacancy in a ward, she was carried out on a stretcher and taken by\nambulance to hospital, where she remained for a fortnight. There was\nsome abdominal swelling and her mouth and throat became inflamed and\nbad, but an X-ray photograph revealed nothing. On account of the facial\ntrouble, the doctor sent her to a dentist on her return home to have her\nteeth extracted, but the dentist refused to do this, saying that there was no\ninfection of the teeth or gums. Day to day notes of the case were entered\nin Mrs Knight's diary ; but the nature of the illness never seemed to be\nclear. I spoke to the doctor, who is a friend of the family, when she came\nto attend to Miss Irwin's wrist, and she told me that, although Mrs Fox\nappeared to be quite well when she came to stay, she had previously under-\ngone a considerable strain.\nMr Knight (Mrs Knight's husband) sufl^ered from thrombosis before\ncoming to Whereham, but at the time of his arrival was in reasonable health\nand was able to play golf. He was obliged to go into hospital for an opera-\ntion on 20 July 1943, and died a week later. Mrs Knight feels that this\nmight not have happened had it not been for the evil influence of the house.\nA nurse who came to stay was taken suddenly ill just after her arrival,\nand Mrs Knight and her sister together have counted the cases of thirteen\nmaids or visitors who have been taken ill in a similar way shortly after\narrival in the house, during the time they have been there. Mrs Roberts,\nwho works in the house daily, told me that she does not feel so well as she\ndid before coming there and that the place makes her feel depressed.\nOther phenomena occurring in the house were as follows. On 27\nJanuary 1943, at 1.30 p.m., Mrs Knight was not well and was in bed, and\nMr Knight was downstairs in the drawingroom. Five loud raps occurred\nin the bedroom. Mr Knight heard them as well as his wife and asked the\nlatter if she was knocking. Miss Irwin, who was in the kitchen, did not\n\f36 Journal of Society for Psychical Research nov.-dec. 1943\nhear them. The entry in Mrs Knight's diary on that date is :\n\" Feh\nsymptoms of cold. In bed. Pecuhar five raps as on door or bedstead at\n1.30 p.m. Jack [Mr Knight] heard it downstairs too.\" Mrs Knight\nthought there might be something of a warning nature in the raps, and\nnoted that her husband went into hospital five months later (20 June).\nThe next night (28 January), there was a queer noise in one of the bed-\nrooms. The diary records :\n\" Queer noise in one room like parcel of\nbooks falling oflf table.\" Mrs Knight was in her bedroom ; Mr Knight\nin bed in the next room, and Miss Irwin in the further room. Mrs Knight\nwent into her sister's room to see what had happened and found that her\nsister had also heard the noise'and thought it was in Mrs Knight's bedroom.\nThey then thought Mr Knight must have fallen out of bed, but found that\nin his room nothing had happened. There was no explanation of the noise.\nOn 29 January there was a noise like a basket of laundry being heavily\ndumped outside the back door. Miss Irwin, though in a bedroom at the\nback of the house, did not hear it. Mrs Knight, who was in the kitchen\n(into which the back door opens), opened the back door but found no one\nthere. There were thus three inexplicable noises on three consecutive days.\nOn 25 April 1943, the following entry occurs in Mrs Knight's diary :\n\" Jack in bed, very poorly. I went to the doctor to get tablets. Bad,\nwindy weather. Noise in night like dog eating big bone.\" Both Mrs\nKnight and her sister gave me a full account of this incident, and showed\nme where it happened. Mrs Knight said she was awakened in the night\nby the noise, which came from under her bed. In her own words, \" it\nwas terrible.\" She turned on the light, but the noise still went on. She\nthen went down on her knees and looked under the bed. There was\nnothing to be seen but the noise still continued. She then fetched her\nsister, who was asleep in another room and had not heard the noise.\nWhen they returned to Mrs Knight's bedroom, the noise had nearly ceased\nbut not quite, and had become intermittent. It had moved to another\npart of the room, and they both heard it. No such noise has been heard\nbefore or since. I asked the usual question as to whether there were any\nrats in the house, but no rats have ever been suspected. There were at\none time some mice, but since a cat has been kept they have disappeared.\nThe bed stood away from the wall, except that the head is against a short\npartition let into the room to accommodate the door, the carpet extending\nhalf way under it. It was on the boarded half that the noise appeared to\nbe taking place. Looking at the place, it seemed to me incredible that a\nrat should have got into the house for one night only, made the noise\ndescribed, left no traces of any kind and never come again.\nOne day when Mrs Knight was in the drawingroom, something slashed\nthe window outside on the right hand side, as if a whip had been used.\nOn a later day, June 17 1943, this was repeated, but this time on the left\nhand side of the window. Both Mr and Mrs Knight were present on the\nsecond occasion and both heard it. Mr Knight went to the window but\ncould find no cause for the sound. I examined the window outside. There\nwere no creepers or climbing roses on that side of the house. There is a\ncreeper on the other side of the front door, but it is a rather fragile looking\nplant, and certainly could not be responsible for the phenomenon, being too\nsmall and too far away.\nMiss Irwin said that in the winter of 1 940-1 (the exact date had not\n\fNOV.-DEC. 1943 Case : Haunted House 37\nbeen recorded), when she and her sister were both sleeping in the front\nbedroom, she was awakened with a feehng of two hands at her throat and\na sensation of evil. She is certain that it was not a dream. Later, when\nshe was sleeping alone in the smaller bedroom, she had a similar experience\nof hands at her throat accompanied by a feeling as if something were\nscrabbling rapidly at the bedclothes. She had been quietly asleep and had\nnot been having a nightmare. Again she had a sensation of something evil.\nOne morning (date not recorded) Mrs Knight went into the bathroom\nand found it filled by a horrible smell. Her description was that it was\nlike a charnel-house, and suggested, in her own words, nothing but \" death\nand the grave \". She returned to her room. When she went back to the\nbathroom five minutes later the smell was still there, but afterwards dissi-\npated. Another day a horrible smell, which she described as a \" dirty\n\"\nsmell, permeated the hall and passage, and the hall door was opened to\nlet it out. A similar smell was once smelt in the pantry. The smell in the\nhall was smelt collectively. No normal explanation could be found.\nI asked whether any phenomena of a poltergeist type had occurred in\nthe house, and Mrs Knight said they had not, with tht'ee possible excep-\ntions. On one occasion an explosion had occurred in the portable wireless\nset (not connected to the mains), and smoke came out! The expert found\nsigns of burning but could find no cause for it. Mrs Knight said :\n\" The\nwireless set never ceased functioning all through the noise like a pistol\nshot, and the smoke, and is going to-day as it was then. No repair has\nbeen done to it.\" On another occasion the bathroom light came on when\nno one was near it, and during the short time Mrs Knight took a visitor\nup to get her hat and coat. No light was in the bathroom when they came\nupstairs, but ten minutes later when they came out of the bedroom the\nlight was on. No one had come up the stairs for several hours. I tested\nthe switch, which was of a new type and fairly stiff and found that it took\na good deal of care and patience to get it to stay in an intermediate position\nbetween on and ofl^. I do not think it could possibly have been left accidently\nin that position, so as to have come on from a position of unstable equi-\nlibrium by itself. It needed very delicate adjustment to get it there.\nOn 4 September 1943, Mrs Knight and her sister came home in the\ndaytime to find lumps of mortar strewn on the front lawn and narrow\nflower border inside the front railings, and some of the bricks of the\npillar into which one end of the railings was fastened forced about three\ninches out of the pillar inwards from the road. A friend who called\nlater knocked them back into position with a pickaxe. His view was that a\ncar had run into the raihngs. I inspected the railings very carefully. On\neither side of the front gate was a soHd brick pillar 18 inches square, sur-\nmounted by a heavy capstone, and at each of the two front corners of the\ngarden was another similar pillar. The two spaces from pillar to pillar,\neach about 10 feet long, were filled in by old-fashioned iron railings of a\nsolid kind, supported on brick footings about 18 inches high, on which\nwere three lengths of flat stone into which the raihngs were fastened.\nThese stones projected over the brick footings underneath, being about\n1 1 inches wide. The upper horizontal member of the railings was fastened\nat each end into a square stone block, which was built into its brick pillar.\nThe whole was very strong and solid. I tried with all my might to shake\nthe railings on the intact side of the gate but without making the slightest\n\f38 '\nJournal of Society for Psychical Research nov.-dec. 1943\nimpression. The bricks which had been forced out of place were those in\nthe pillar at the further end from the gate and were against the stone block,\nshowing that the force had been exerted on the railings and not on the\npillar. Indeed, all the bricks on the outside of the pillar were imtouched,\nalthough any car which had run on to the pavement and given a glancing\nblow to the railings would have been bound to collide with the projecting\npillar. It must also have scraped along the edge of the stone slabs forming\nthe top of the footing. Moreover, when the railings were painted green,\nthese slabs were painted also, and the green paint along their edges was\nnot even scratched, and was in the same condition as on the firm railings\nthe other side of the gate. It was quite clear to me that the force had not\nbeen caused by a passing car or lorry. Mrs Knight said, also, that there\nwere no skid-marks on the pavement. In only one way, I imagine, could\na lorry have produced the effect. If a lorry with an overhanging back had\nturned there and backed into the railings at right angles to them, it might\n. have forced them inwards without touching the stone or brick work. But\nthe back would have had to be well padded not to mark the paint. The\nroad at that point is only 18 feet wide and no lorry driver in his senses\nwould attempt to turn in it, since Meadow Lane offers an ideal turning\nplace only ten yards away, on the opposite side of the front gate. The\nflat stone at the bottom of the railings next the pillar had been forced a\nquarter of an inch inwards. Very great force must have been used.\nMrs Knight has had only two visual experiences in the house, or,\nindeed, in the course of her life. On 6 August 1943, she and her sister\nwere sleeping in the large, front bedroom. Both were awake, and the\ntime was 11.55 P-\"^- Miss Irwin got up suddenly and pulled the clothes\noff Mrs Knight's side of the bed. When asked why she did so, she could\nonly answer that she had got up to look at the time. She said afterwards\nthat she felt she had to get up. At the same time she saw a fan of white\nlight on the skirting near the door, and said :\n\" Do look !\n\" Mrs Knight\nthen saw a pillar of soft, golden light with a pencil of blue-grey light\ndividing the lower half in the middle. Both said they saw this.^ Mrs\nKnight particularly noticed the height of the pillar because it formed close\nbeside the wardrobe, and reached a little above the place where her own\nhead would have come to. While they were still looking at it, suddenly it\nwas not there and the room was dark again.\nIn mid-July, Mrs Knight had seen an oval spot of light moving under\nthe window sill, along the wall, which she could not account for by any\nnormal light. This was about a fortnight after her husband died, and she\nassociated both the visions with him.\nIt is extremely difficult to find out much about the past history of the\nhouse. According to rumour, one former occupant went into a neighbour-\ning town and drowned himself. The child of another died suddenly with\nno apparent cause when just under two years old. The husband of the\nwidow lady from whom Mrs Knight took the house died suddenly, and\nshe herself met with an accident shortly afterwards. People who may\nknow more are unwilling to say anything for fear that their statements\n^ Mrs Knight thinks a figure was beginning to form and that this pencil of\nlight was the division between the legs. See formation of head from yellow-\nblue light in Proc. xxxiii, p. 174. Also formatien of brow and eyes from blue,\nluminous mist in an Experimental case in Journal vii. pp. 252-3.\n\fNOV.-DEC. 1943 Case : Haunted House 39\nmight depreciate the value of the house and place them in an undesirable\nlegal position. Mrs Knight writes :\n\" Never before this last three years\nhas a maid or visitor been taken ill on coming to my house. On the\ncontrary, they have always benefited by being in my house.\" This I can\nwell believe, for seldom have I felt myself to be in such a cheerful and\nhospitable atmosphere.\nThe fact which needs accounting for is that Mrs Knight and her sister\nheard nothing against the house till August 1943, having taken it in- 1940.\nYet, before this August they had made up their minds to leave on account\nof their own experiences in the house. When they were told, it was by a\nfriend who knew something of the house and its reputation\u2014a Miss\nHardy. .\nMrs Knight writes :\n\" Miss Hardy called to say how sorry she\nwas to find my sister, Mrs Fox, had be^n taken suddenly ill so soon after\nthe loss of my husband. I said, '\nMiss Hardy,' it's this house.' '\nWho\ntold you ', she said. I replied, '\nNobody, it is what we have experienced\nhere ourselves.' Then she told me how sorry she had been to hear we\nwere coming (we had known Miss Hardy and her family for years) as it was\nwell known -to be the unluckiest house in Whereham. '\nBut', she said, '\nI\ncouldn't say anything, could I ?\n' \" Certainly, apart from these happen-\nings, Mrs Knight and Miss Irwin have every inducement to stay. The house\nis bright and cheerful and easy to run. She and her husband were both\nvery popular in Whereham and had many friends. Mrs Knight is a good\nand accurate witness : she knows nothing about psychical research. There\nseems in this case to have been no prepossession or bias of any kind to\nfavour the hypothesis of expectation or suggestion.\nIt is exceedingly difficult to estimate whether or not it is reasonable to\nput down any remarkable sequence of events to chance. Taken indi-\nvidually, it is not impossible to put down some of the illnesses, accidents\nand deaths which have occurred in the house (so far as is known) to normal\ncauses. Mrs. Knight says that they stand in complete contrast to her\nexperiences before she came there ; but suppose that a person, after\ntaking a house, had a phenomenal run of good luck, would he put it down\nto the good influence of the house, or would he say that his own fortune\nhad changed for the better } The latter seems the more likely. Why not,\nthen, in the converse case A good deal depends on establishing whether\nabnormally bad luck dogged all the previous occupants ; and this is very\ndifficult to do. But the sounds, smells and visions certainly seem to have\nb.een supernormal (though the visions may have had nothing to do with\nthe house), and it may be held that the fact that the items of ill luck were\nconjoined to these strengthens the ground for regarding the misfortunes\nas supernormal also.\nIn the present state of house shortage. No. 13 is not likely to remain\nempty for long after Mrs Knight leaves, and it will be interesting to\nobserve how the next occupants fare, if the information can be obtained.\nOne interesting question is whether the sounds and smells experienced\nin the house were due to physical, though supernormal, causes, or were\nnon-physical and hallucinatory. The clearest test of non-physical charac-\nter is when several persons possessed of normal senses are present so that\nall must have heard the sound or smelt the smell if the cause were physical,\nbut when, in fact, only some did so. In this case, although several of the\nexperiences were shared by two persons, it is not clear that anyone was\n\f4\u00a9 Journal of Society for Psychical Research nov.-dec. 1943\never so situated that he or she must have shared the experience had it been\nphysical, but did not. On the whole it seems probable that both sounds\nand smells were hallucinatory or non-physical in character, as is most\ngenerally the case. The case of the railings, which was certainly due to a\nphysical cause, remains puzzling. If the non-physical character of the\nsounds and smells be granted, the case provides up-to-date evidence of\ncollective percipience, which is of great theoretical importance.\nIn conclusion, I should like to thank both Mrs \" Knight \" and Miss\n\" Irwin \" for the extremely kind and generous hospitality they extended\nto Miss Johnson and myself under very trying circumstances, and for the\nwilling help they gave us in the inquiry.\nREVIEW\nOne Hundred Cases for Survival after Death. By A. T. Baird. T. Werner\nLaurie, pp. 195, los. 6d.\nTo keep the mind fully conversant with their subject, specialists find it\ndesirable to re-study their own publications after some years' interval.\nIn course of time detail becomes blurred and important facts may pass\nbeyond easy recollection if not occasionally called to mind. This is\nrelevant to Psychical Research in which so many isolated incidents come\nbefore one's notice. One frequently finds that critics seem unaware of\nevidence which they must at one time have known, but which they have\nconveniently forgotten, with the result that their conclusions are not in\naccord with ascertained fact. Mr Baird has done good service by gathering\nunder convenient headings well verified cases representing the several\ntypes of evidence on which conclusions may be logically based. It makes\na convenient reference book for students and at the same time affords\ninteresting reading for the general public. It shows how strong is the\nevidence for human survival. Half the cases are selected from the publi-\ncations of the English and the American Societies for Psychical Research,\na sufficient guarantee for their soundness, while the remainder have passed\nthe scrutiny of intelligent observers. The author's Preface alludes to the\nembarrassing amount of good material from which this selection was\nmade and suggests that it would have been t^asy to have presented five\nthousand cases for survival instead of the mere hundred chosen. It con-\ncludes with these words, \" I think that all the writing in the world will\nnot convince any one so thoroughly as evidence found for oneself, but\nthat is no reason why the investigations of others should not be collected\nand placed on record in a convenient form. Hence this book.\" With\nthat conclusion we agree.\nIt should be added that each type of evidence is prefaced by a brief and\nwell-informed explanation ; the allusions to Apparitions, Deathbed\nVisions, Automatic Writing, Trance Phenomena, Proxy Sittings and\nDirect Voice Phenomena being especially helpful. It is a book which can\nbe confidently recommended. C. D. T.\nFURTHER RECOGNITION OF PSYCHICAL RESEARCH\nWe are glad to be able to record that the Trustees of the Leverhulme\nResearch Fellowships have recently awarded a grant to Mr Whately\nCarington, for a period of two years, in support of his researches into\nParanormal Cognition.\n\/\n\fJOURNAL OF THE\nSOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH\nfor Private Circulation amongst Members and Associates only\nJanuary-February, 1944 '\nVol. XXXIII\u2014No. 600-601\nCONTENTS\nPAGE\nAnnual Report of the Council for 1943 - - - - 42\nAccounts for 1943 - -- -- -- -44\nNOTICE OF MEETING\nTHE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF\nTHE SOCIETY\nwill be held in . .\nThe Society's Library,\n31 Tavistock Square, London, W.C. i\nON\nFriday, 25 February 1944, at 3 p.m.\nTo transact the business set out on the formal notice dated\nthe 21 January 1944, and already circulated.\nMR KENNETH RICHMOND WILL SPEAK ON\nPRECOGNITION\nN.B.\n\u2014\nMembers alone have the right to take part in the business of the\nAnnual General Meeting, but Associates may be present.\n\f42 Journal of Society for Psychical Research jan.-feb. 1944\nANNUAL REPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR 1943\n(i) Research, {a) The Precognition Committee has continued its work\nwith a small group of percipients and is now engaged on a large-scale\nexperiment to see what effects can be obtained with a number of percipients\napproaching 100. Significant results have been obtained which suggest\nprecognitive telepathy, but more extensive experiment is desirable, and it\nis hoped that the large-scale experiments now being conducted will make\nthe results already obtained easier to understand. Mr Carington has\ngiven valuable assistance in examining and assessing the results ; Mr\nParsons has also been good enough to help in this work.\nMr Richmond hopes shortly to read a paper on the Committee's work.\n{b) The important experiments conducted by Mr Soal and Mrs Goldney\nhave been continued. An account of them was given by Mr Soal and Mrs\nGoldney at a meeting of the Society in October 1942, and a full report of\nthem as continued to April 1943 has now been published in Part 167 of\nProceedings.\n(c) Mr Carington reports that he has continued his researches in Para-\nnormal Cognition in co-operation with the Cambridge Committee. The\ndifficulty of obtaining percipients under war-time conditions has greatly\nrestricted the possibilities of experiments, and work has been mainly con-\ncentrated on developing theoretical conclusions from the results already\nobtained and from others in this field. Mr Carington gave an outline of\nhis theory in the paper referred to below, and it is hoped to publish a full\naccount of it in Proceedings shortly.\n(d) Investigation of the relief of pain carried out by Mr Frederick\nKnowles has been continued weekly since the summer of 1942. Patients\nsuffering from various physical conditions causing pain have come forward\nas subjects for the silent mental concentration which Mr Knowles applies\nfor the relief of painful symptoms and in some degree for a general better-\nment of the condition. Over 40 complete cases are now on record. A\ndebt of gratitude is due to Dr Morna Rawlins who has given much time\nto the investigation, and attended the proceedings on a large number of\noccasions, besides lending a room in her house where patients do not have\nto negotiate steps, as at the Society's rooms.\n(e) The Council wish to call attention to the most important experi-\nmental work in all forms of extra-sensory perception and also in \" psycho-\nkinesis \" now being conducted in the United States. It is difficult at the\npresent to conduct large-scale experiments in this country, but members\nwho will consult recent numbers of the Journal of Parapsychology, espec-\nially those for March and June 1943, and also of the Journal of the American\nS.P.R., will probably find types of experiment which they can conduct\nwith groups of friends. The S.P.R. Working Group has begun to experi-\nment with the techniques described, and the Council congratulate those\nmembers who have already undertaken experimental work on their own\ninitiative, and would gladly receive reports from still more members.\n(\/) Reports of spontaneous phenomena in various parts of the country\nhave been received and such enquiries as are practicable in present circum-\nstances have been made : an interesting case, investigated by Mr Tyrrell,\nhas been printed in the Journal for December 1943.\n\fJAN.-FEB. 1944 Annual Report 43\n(2) Finance. In February the Society suffered a very severe loss by the\nsudden death of Mr H. F. Sahmarsh, the Acting Trustee of the Research\nEndowment Fund, and, since the beginning of the war, the Acting Hon.\nTreasurer of the Society. A tribute to his valuable work both in admini-\nstering the Society's finances, and also in research, has appeared in Pro-\nceedings, Part 167. The Council have not found any one able and willing\nto take Mr Saltmarsh's place. Fortunately the Hon. Treasurer, Admiral\nStrutt, is now in a position to resume some of his former duties, and to\nassist him the Council have increased the membership of the House and\nFinance Committee.\nThe general financial position is that the Society is living within its\nincome, if the General Fund and the Endowment Fund are taken to-\ngether, but that it has in recent years (though not in 1943) been necessary\nfor the Endowment Fund to subsidise the General Fund out of its surplus\nincome. The General Fund ends the present year with a substantial\nbalance in hand {\u00a3354 4^- lod.). This is due partly to a welcome donation\nof \u00a3125 from an American friend, who writes most appreciatively of the\nSociety's work, and partly to the accident that Part 167 of Proceedings,\nthough printed in 1943, will be paid for in 1944.\n(3) The year has seen two useful developments in the Society's activi-\nties, the formation of a Discussion Group, and of a Working Group.\nIn the spring of this year the Council decided, on the initiative of Mr\nTyrrell, to revive the practice of holding informal meetings for the dis-\ncussion of various aspects of psychical research by members and their\nfriends. Although the S.P.R. is a scientific body, whose main task is the\npursuit of scientific research, its labours have a direct bearing on many\nother fields, the relation of which to psychical research needs free discus-\nsion. Such discussion, it was thought, would at the same time serve to\nbring members together and to stimulate thought and interest in our\nsubject. Seven meetings have now been held, the first of which took\nplace on i April 1943, and during these the following subjects have been\ndiscussed : The Relation of Psychical Research to Spiritualism ; The\nEvolutionary Aspects of Extra-Sensory Perception ; Mr Whately\nCarington's Work and Theory ;\nCross-Correspondences ;\nApparitions ;\nThe Relief of Pain by Mental Concentrations ; Reincarnation.\nAttendances have been good (though the return with winter of the\nearly black-out has caused some reduction), and may be taken to indicate\nthat meetings for discussion are appreciated by members.\nThe kindness of Mr and Mrs Richmond in assisting these discussions\nand in offering their flat for the first meeting is greatly appreciated.\nA number of younger members, with the collaboration of Mr and Mrs\nRichmond and Mrs Goldney, have formed a group meeting on Wednesday\nevenings to work on practical problems. These have helped in the\nchecking of index cards for the third volume of the Index to Proceedings\nand Journal (reported in paragraph 5). Experiments have been started\nby the group on dice-throwing to investigate the \" psycho-kinetic effect\n\"\nreported by Rhine. A sub-group under Mr N. Richmond has also studied\nMr Knowles's methods of alleviating pain referred to above {id). This\ngroup has also had some discussion meetings addressed by members of\nthe Society. Most of the members are war workers and their attendance\n\fCD 1-1 o\nGOO? o O Ci c; 03 in w CO (M urs o cc ir:' X\nI 1\u20141 rH r-H rH i-( rH i-H\na.

Mr\nCarington has been awarded a grant by the Trustees of the Leverhulme\nResearch Fellowships for the prosecution of research into extra-sensory\nperception. Dr Bendit was given the degree of Doctor of Medicine by\nCambridge University for a thesis on \" Paranormal Cognition : Its Place\nin Human Psychology \". This is believed to be the first time that a\nBritish University has accepted a thesis for a doctorate in medicine on a\nsubject connected with psychical research.\nIt is also of interest to record that the Medical Superintendent of a\nCounty Mental Hospital lately asked the Society to give appropriate\nguidance to a patient whose unsuitably developed automatism had led to\npathological hallucinations ; the patient and his wife were seen by Mr\nRichmond and have since written expressing gratitude to the Society for\nthe help that they received.\n(5) The absence of a Combined Index of the Society's Proceedings and\nJournal since 1913, when the last instalment was published, has long been\n*\na serious hindrance to the study of our subject. A Committee to supervise\nthe preparation of a new Index was appointed in 1940, and made recom-\nmendations to the Council as to the general lines the new Index should\nfollow. The work of preparing it was entrusted to Mr Richmond who\nreports that it is now completed in the form of a comprehensive card index\nwhich is being checked and revised section by section. Special thanks\nare due to Lady Hedley, Miss Muir Mackenzie and Mrs Richmond for\ntheir help in the long task of preparing the card index. It is hoped that\nthe paper situation and the financial position will permit of publication at\nan early date.\n(6) The Council have appointed a Committee to take such action as is\npracticable now to make better known the Society's work, and the signi-\nficance of psychical research and its relation to other branches of thought,\nand also to plan out a more extensive scheme with the same objects in view\nto be carried into effect after the war.\n(7) Presidency. Dr. R. H. Thouless kindly consented to act as President\nfor a second year.\n(8) Obituary. In addition to Mr Saltmarsh, the Society has lost by\ndeath two former Council members. Miss RadclyfTe Hall and Mr W. R.\nBousfield, K.C., F.R.S., and also Mr Hubert Wales, all of whom took an\nactive part in the Society's work.\n(9) Library. We are glad to record an increase in the number of\nMembers who borrowed books from the Library during the year :\n77\nMembers borrowed 545 books, as compared with 58 Members who\nborrowed 439 books in 1942, and 63 books were borrowed by the National\nCentral Library.\n(10) Membership of the Society. 37 new Members and 5 Student-\nAssociates were elected. The total loss from deaths, resignations, and\n\f48 Journal of Society for Psychical Research jan.-feb. 1944\nother causes is 24 Members and 12 Associates, leaving a net increase of 6\nin the total membership of the Society, which now stands at 588.\n(11) Publications. One Part of Proceedings was published during the\nyear (Part 167) in December ; also the 7th Myers Memorial Lecture\nentitled \" Apparitions \" by Mr G. N. M. Tyrrell in March.\nThe Secretary's sale to the general public amounted to \u00a325 3s. id. and\nto Members of the Society \u00a3^ i8s. gd., and through the Society's Agent in\nthe United States, 6s. 8d. The sale of the 7th Myers Memorial\nLecture, especially to the public, has been remarkable, 98 copies having\nbeen sold up to date.\n(12) Meetings.

Secretary. Mrs Goldney, in seconding the vote of\nthanks, said that it was not realised by those who did not come into close\ntouch with the detailed work of the Society how many-sided was the work\ndone by him, both at the Society's rooms and at home. The vote was\ncarried unanimously.\nThe Chairman announced that there were no candidates for election to\nmembership of the Council other than the six members who retired by\nrotation, and the following six members were accordingly unanimously\nelected : Professor C.

Mrs Alfred\nLyttelton, Messrs Miall, Savage, Avery & Co. were re-elected Auditors\nfor the forthcoming year.\nPRIVATE MEETING\nThe 1 80th Private Meeting of the Society was held in the Library on\nFriday, 25 February 1944, after the Annual General Meeting. The\nPresident in the Chair. Mr Kenneth Richmond spoke on Precognition.\n\" DISPLACEMENT \" : SOME COMMENTS ON\nMR RUSSELL'S PAPER\nIn the June number of the Journal of Parapsychology Mr William Russell\nreports the results of his examination of a few American (E.S.P.) series\nwith Zencr cards from the standpoint of \" displacement \". In four of the\nseries discussed the experiments were \" distance \" tests and the subject\nobtained high scores on the actual or \" target \" card. In two other series\nchosen the subjects had shown previous ability to score successfully on the\n\" actual \" card but their scores had fallen apparently to the chance level in\nthe runs under examination. In none of the series discussed is there any\nsatisfactory evidence that the percipient was scoring hits on the cards\nimmediately before or after the \" target \" card. In fact the phenomenon\nof \" displacement \" noted by Mr Carington, Mrs Goldney, Dr Thouless\nand myself was conspicuous by its absence.\n\fMARCH-APRIL 1 944 \" Displacement \" : Some Comments 53\nThe first, and perhaps most important point to be observed, is that in\nthe case of the majority of the series examined the timing conditions were\nalmost certainly very different from those which obtained throughout our\nwork in England with the subject (B.S.). During the past two years we\nhave demonstrated with reasonable certainty that the displacement effect\nnoted is one of temporal and not of spatial displacement. And we have\nshown further in the case of (B.S.) that he possesses a span of precognition\nwhich reaches from 2^-4 seconds in front of the instant at which the\n\" target \" card is presented to the agent. If the interval between succes-\nsive presentations is increased even to 5 seconds the subject fails to score\nsignificantly on either precognitive or postcognitive hits. It is quite pro-\nbable that this span of prehension in time varies with different subjects\nbut it would have to be found for a given subject by experiment unless it\nwere hit upon by good luck. But for the fact that B.S. insisted on the\ncalls being made at an unusually rapid rate we should, in all probability,\nhave missed the phenomenon entirely in his case. Actually I believe the\nrate of calling with my first subject Mrs (S.) was somewhat slower than in\nthe work with (B.S.). But in the \" Pearce-Pratt \" series examined by\nMr Russell there was I believe an interval of a whole minute between\nsuccessive calls, and it is certain that in the other series discussed (\" Turner-\nOwnbey \" and \" Marchesi \"), in which agent and subject were separated\nby distances of perhaps hundreds of miles, it would have been quite im-\npossible without the use of the telephone to have carried out an experi-\nment with intervals of less than a minute. The same remark applies to\nthe \" Riess \" series carried out at a distance of about a mile. If therefore\nthe temporal conditions were in the series discussed incompatible with the\nsubject's span of prehension the failure to obtain displacement is easily\naccounted for.\nBut other conditions may also have to be taken into consideration. We\nobtained incontrovertible evidence in the case of our subject (B.S.) that\nhe fails entirely to produce these displacement effects when the conditions\nare those of \" clairvoyance What he appears to succeed in doing is to\nbecome aware of an image that is going to be in the agent's mind in two or\nthree seconds time. But if I remember rightly the \" Pearce-Pratt \" series\nwas one in which the agent did not look at the cards. In the \" Riess \" and\n\" Turner-Ownbey \" experiments on the other hand the telepathic condi-\ntion prevailed.\nDuring our two years' work with (B.S.) on only one occasion did he\nobtain a highly significant score on the actual or target card and on this\noccasion the (\u00b11) scores fell to the level of chance expectation. In the\ncase of this subject at any rate \" target \" scoring and \" displacement\n\"\nscoring seem to be mutually antagonistic to one another.\nIt is perhaps unfortunate that Mr Russell should have written his paper\nin complete ignorance of the extensive investigations of displacement\nwhich Mrs Goldney and I have carried out during the past three years.\nAs these have now been published {S.P.R. Proc, Part 167), we hope he\nwill be able to study them. In our view they constitute evidence for E.S.P.\nin general and for temporal displacement in particular which is incontro-\nvertible.\nOne other remark seems worth making. It appears to me that E.S.P.\n\f54 Journal of Society for Psychical Research march-april 1944\nis a creative activity working out its own patterns in the individual subject.\nWe must not then expect to find \" laws \" governing parapsychological\nphenomena of the type observed in physics, nor must we expect that\nsubjects will conform to type. Rather I expect we shall discover infinite\ndiversity in the types of paranormal functioning displayed as we examine a\nlarger number of gifted percipients. By observing the work of say a mere\nhalf-dozen good subjects it is quite impossible to predict what the next\ngood subject will reveal.\nPersons who can produce E.S.P. effects over any extended length of\ntime are I believe very rare, and it is to be hoped that when the next\nE.S.P. \" star \" appears in America Dr Rhine or Dr Murphy will pay some\nattention to the important question of varying intervals between successive\ncalls. I believe there is little to be hoped for from the study of subjects\nwhose E.S.P. powers are so weak and uncertain as to be almost negligible.\nTo apply routine tests to everyday people in the mass does not make for\nprogress since all that results from such a study is a cancelling out of a\nnumber of opposing idiosyncrasies.^ It is with gifted individuals that the\nimportant work of the future is likely to be concerned.\nS. G. SOAL.\nCORRESPONDENCE\nTo the Editor of the Journal\nSir,\u2014On reading the account of some poltergeist phenomena of an\napparently unintelligible nature in the Journal for Nov. -Dec. 1943, I was\nreminded of the general tendency to conclude that, because a manifesta-\ntion is incoherent, there can be no intelligence, or only a sub-human\nintelligence, behind it. The possibility of the unintelligibility being due\nto lack of facility for expression should not be ignored, and it is my opinion\nthat it is a good plan to have reputable mediums visit the scenes of haunt-\nSomewhat relevant in this connection is an interesting incident which\ncame within my personal experience, and which I should like to describe.\nIt is a case of automatism which illustrates that a guiding intelligence may\nbe present even when, for some reason of unfavourable conditions, the\n\" messages \" have no meaning.\nThe incident took place in 194 1. I was invited to investigate the\nphenomena of two ladies who found they had an aptitude for obtaining\nspiritistic messages. They were reputable people, and regarded the matter\nrather in the light of a curiosity. It was arranged that I should have an\nevening to try out any experiment I wished at the residence of the mutual\nacquaintances who had introduced me to the automatists. The ladies\nemployed an inverted glass tumbler, placed on a polished table, in the\ncentre of a circle of slips of paper marked with the letters of the alphabet.\nThey each placed a finger tip on top of the glass, and waited for it to slide\nabout, touching the letters one by one and so spelling out \" messages \".\n^ It is to be remembered, however, that the \" displacement \" effect was discovered\n(by Mr Whately Carington) through experiments with many ordinary people, and\nthat this led on to the investigation of the special case of Mr B.S.\n\u2014\nEd.\n\fMARCH-APRIL 1 944 ' Correspondence 55\nOn the occasion when I was present, the results were poor, and most of\nwhat was speh out was meaningless. However, I resolved to continue\nwith the experiment I had determined upon, and it turned out very\nfortunate that I did so. First of all, the automatists were securely blind-\nfolded with materials that I had brought with me for the purpose. I had\npractised on myself beforehand to make sure the method was effective.\nTwenty-eight slips of paper, prepared by myself, bearing the letters of the\nalphabet and the words \" yes \" and \" no \" were arranged in a circle round\nthe inverted glass in the usual way. The automatists' fingers were then\nplaced in position for them, and the customary questions were addressed\nto the \" glass \" in the hope of obtaining replies under these unusual con-\nditions. It was necessary to inform the blindfolded operators what was\nbeing spelt out, but this did not matter as I was constantly rearranging the\nletters so that their positions could not be memorised. Most of the slips\nof paper were reshuffled every time the glass touched a letter. The move-\nments were more clumsy, and the glass had to be periodically replaced in\nthe centre of the circle, but the letters were so spaced that there was very\nlittle difficulty in determining which letter the glass was touching.\nNotes were taken during the proceedings of every question asked and\nevery letter that the glass touched,^ but nothing intelligible was obtained,\nand everyone present, including myself, thought the experiment had been\na complete failure. Not until I arrived home and examined the notes at\nleisure did I realise the significance of what had happened.\nNo question which required an answer other than \" yes \" or \" no \" had\nreceived any proper reply, but of the seventeen questions where the answer\n\" yes \" or \" no \" was at all appropriate, the glass had in seven cases\nstraight away approached and touched one of the two papers marked \" yes\n\"\nor \" no \". In three more instances, the \" yes \" or \" no \" was touched\nafter a first attempt had apparently failed. This result was far above what\ncould have come about by chance. If the movements of the glass had been\nrandom, the probability of a hit on either the \" yes \" or the \" no \" would\nhave been 1\/14, and at least seven hits were obtained in seventeen trials.\nThe conditions of the experiment were moderately stringent, and the\nresult was not the type of thing that could reasonably be expected to come\nabout by fraud, so that one is forced into the conclusion that some intel-\nligent psychical influence was guiding the glass. This was certainly not\napparent at the time, and the other observers could hardly credit it when\nI explained the result to them later on.\nIf the experiment of having automatists work with letters they cannot\nsee, and arranged in an order unknown to them, were more frequently\nrepeated, it is likely that remarkable evidence for E.S.P. would be obtained.\nYours faithfully,\nDonald J. West.\nSir,\u2014We feel a word of apology and explanation is due to readers of\nour Report, Experiments in precognitive telepathy, lately published as\nPart 167 of Proceedings. We realise only too well that, from the point of\nview of the average reader, the Report is both too technical and too\nlaboured to be \" readable \".

Journal\nof the American Society for Psychical Research, Oct. 1943 and Jan.\n1944.\nWar-time constriction of space confines us to regrettably scanty notice\nof the admirable Journal of the A.S.P.R., and in selecting Dr Murphy's\nimportant contributions for brief attention we leave aside much else that\nis of interest. Dr Murphy corrects a tendency of research to simplify\nparanormal reactions into events that occur, and to neglect a main\ncondition of their occurrence\u2014^the human motives, conscious and un-\nconscious, which govern all acts of perception. These are reducible to the\n\" needs \" which, using the term in a wide psychological sense, he proceeds\nto discuss. He cites a number of cases from S.P.R. and other records to\nshow how intimately paranormal perception may be bound up with the\ninner motivations of the percipient. This, clearly, is the proper psychologi-\ncal starting-point, in a not unknown field of mental action, for the explora-\ntion of the wider and largely unknown field of good and bad \" conditions\n\"\nfor the occurrence of paranormal events. At present we talk glibly of\nrepeating an experiment when the circumstances of the \" repetition\n\"\nmay have altered the determinants of the expected effect to an incalculable\nextent.\nFrom this it is only a step to the subject of his second article, the\nremoval (or circumvention) of mental \" needs \" which block the emergence\nof psi-impressions. In the first place, distraction arises from habitual\nprocesses of attention to here-and-now needs and so to the messages of\nthe senses ; thus paranormal receptivity usually requires a greater or less\ndegree of dissociation from normal sensory awareness. But dissociation\nis only a device, not a royal road. \" We discover, now and then, more\nsubtle ways of focusing the unconscious activity of the subject upon the\nspecific material intended.\" Dr Murphy again quotes several cases, and\nhis discussion considerably clears our view of the problems with which we\nhave to deal in trying to understand and to facilitate the percipient's\nfunction, K.

Mr McWharrie was of a very modest\nand retiring disposition, and would not allow any of his many gifts to be\nacknowledged in our Journal under his own name. He was keenly\ninterested in the Society's work, and used often to write enquiring as to\nour progress. He had a special admiration for the work of F. W. H.\nMyers, of which he often spoke, and he distributed many copies of the\nunabridged edition of Human Personality among his friends. He reported\nseveral cases to the Society, including the \" Chaffin Will Case \" {Proc,\nvol. XXXVI, p. 5 17), 'which has become the best-known case in our\ntime of the apparition of a dead man conveying information unknown to\nthe percipient, or, so far as could be ascertained, to any other living person.\nWe also regret to record the death of Mr L. H. Myers, the eldest child of\nFrederic Myers, one of the founders of the Society. Mr Myers, who had\nbeen a Member since 1907, was well-known as the author of several books\nof which the most notable was \" The Root and the Flower \", a long novel\nwith the India of the Emperor Akbar as its setting and the interaction of\nthe religious and philosophical systems of that time as its subject.\nMr L. H. Myers was a trustee of the Myers Memorial Trust ever since\nits foundation in 1929.\nWe also regret to record the death of Miss Helen Dallas, for many years\na valued member of the Society and a contributor of thoughtful comment\nfrom the standpoint of Spiritualism.\nCASE : AN \" OUT OF THE BODY \" EXPERIENCE\nThe following case is of interest as an addition to the records of a particular\ntype of dissociative experience, in which the experient seems to himself to\ntravel in space, perceiving his body as an object left behind. Mr Kenwood\n(pseudonym) had the experience in 1933, and has recorded it recently\nas a still vivid memory : the lapse of time is of the less importance in that\nthe case has no claim to be veridical. His description of a subsequent\nsitting at which a medium alluded to the episode is included as a matter of\n\fMAY-JUNE 1944 Case : An \" Out of the Body \"Experience 59\ninterest, but there is no evidence to show that the medium did not know\nof Mr Kenwood's experience.\nSuch experiences are infrequent in the hterature of psychical research,\nbut they show certain common features worth studying, such as the\nimpression of a cord uniting the non-corporeal self to the body. A special\nfeature of this case is a definitely developed impression of a discarnate\npersonality with whom contact is made during the experience. In the\nWiltse case [Proc, vol. VIII, p. 180) a \" presence \" is encountered and\nexpounds the meaning of the experience ; and in the Geddes case (re-\nviewed in t]\\t Journal oi July 1937, p. 103) a somewhat similar personalised,\nexternal \" mentor \" appears to fulfil a similar purpose. In Mr Kenwood's\ncase the \" presence \" is a recognised individual : it first takes the form of a\nstar, and this changes to human form and descends into the percipient's\nbody. In Milton, Book I, Blake\u2014whose vision or fantasy seems often to\nhave been at the fringe of sensory hallucination\u2014has a comparable image ;\nThen first I saw him in the Zenith as a falling star\nDescending perpendicular, swift as the swallow or swift :\nAnd on my left foot falling on the tarsus, entered there. . . .\nExperiences of apparent separation from the body seem to be precipitated\nby conditions of illness or mental stress : in the present example, Mr\nKenwood had administered to his wife who was ill and in severe pain an\ninjection of a drug of whose action he had no previous knowledge, and\nwas anxious as to the effect. His ensuing experience is given in his\nown words.\n\" My wife quietened down rapidly until I could hardly detect pulse or\nrespiration. I was genuinely afraid of leaving her, and sat on the edge of\nthe bed watching her in my pyjamas, determined to sit up through the\nnight. That was my last conscious thought.\n\" I awoke the next morning at 8 a.m., to find my wife much better\nafter a good night's enforced sleep. I then told her I had enjoyed an\namazing experience in the night. I had no recollection of getting into bed,\nwhich I must have done since I was there in the morning, but I remem-\nbered lying there and looking up. The ceiling seemed to disappear as\nalso the roof, and I clearly saw a star, or what appeared to be a star. Then,\nI can only describe this my own way, I was given psychic vision, for my\nSpirit left my body which I saw by my wife's in bed. I seemed to resemble\nthe shape of a flame with a long silver thread attached to my earth body.\nI enjoyed, what I can only liken to, the Peace of God which passeth all\nunderstanding, I have never enjoyed sach mental exhilaration before or\nsince.\n\" I looked up at the '\nstar '\nand remember thinking '\nI've gone through\nthe roof and the ceiling but I mustn't break that cord '. The star came\nnearer, and in passing me assumed the head, neck, and thorax of my\nFather-in-law (deceased). He told me by impressing it on my mind that\nmy wife would be all right. He shot down and I turned to see him enter\nmy body. By this time my silver cord seemed very long indeed, but I\nagain went up and then my memory ends for a space. There was defi-\nnitely a space of time during which I had no conscious memory although\nit was impressed on my mind that such was the case. My memory came\n\f6o Journal of Society for Psychical Research may-june 1944\nback as I came shooting earthwards. Again I passed my Father-in-law\nwho impressed the thought on my mind, '\nDon't worry about her, she is\nquite all right '. I remember the cord getting very short but I am unable\nto recall anything of the re-entry into my body.\n\" All this I told my wife and after a short while when she was well again\nwe had a small circle in our own house : my mother-in-law, my wife,\nmyself and the Medium. The '\nControl '\nwished us good evening and\nsaid a gentleman wished to speak to me. The Control went and my\nfather-in-law came. After establishing his identity by telling us his earth\nnickname, I asked where we had last met. He said, '\nYou want to know\nif your experience of a little while ago was real or imaginary. Believe me,\nit was very real. We considered it was necessary to take you, to relieve\nyour anxiety. You must excuse me for using your body for a short while,\nbut I'm sure you found I had done no harm. Now forget all about it\n'.\"\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE METHODS OF\nRESEARCH\nThe growth of the statistical method in psychical research raises the\nquestion of how this Society should shape its programme of research.\nHave we, in this method, an instrument for solving the main difficulties\nof the subject ; or must we regard it as only an important auxiliary.''\nAn impressive list of advantages are claimed for the statistical method :\n(i) that it can deal unanswerably with the chance-question ; (2) that it\naffords the only means of convincing the scientific world of the validity of\nour evidence ; (3) that it provides the only form of repeatable experiment ;\n(4) that a weak and widely distributed extra-sensory faculty can be detected\nby it, and in no other way ; (5) that it affords a means of distinguishing\nbetween the difterent modes of the faculty, as, for example, between tele-\npathy and clairvoyance ; (6) that, by introducing measurement, it raises\npsychical research from the status of natural history to that of science ;\n(7) that it enables the experimenter to start from simple situations and work\ntowards the complex ; (8) that in consequence of (6) and (7), it offers the\nonly hope of unravelling the theory of paranormal phenomena.\nSpace does not allow me to say more about the first five of these claims\nthan to register a general agreement with them. But I would remark that\nin the richer phenomena a probability-figure concerning chance is often\nneither possible nor necessary ; and that many non-quantitative experi-\nments are repeatable, though admittedly they are not repeatable in the\nsame controlled way as are statistical experiments. The crux lies in\nclaims (6), (7) and (8).\nWith regard to (6), one often hears it said that science is measurement,\nand that the application of measurement to psychical research has rescued\nit from the region of \" anecdote \" and placed it in the laboratory. I would\npoint out that the essence of science does not lie in measurement but in\nthe appeal to experience as opposed to a priori reasoning. Science con-\nsists in finding out by experiment or observation what is instead of reason-\ning about what otighl to be or must be on the basis of assumed postulates.\n\fy\nMAY-JUNE 1944 Quantitative and Qualitative Methods of Research 61\nProfessor Whitehead shows this clearly in Chapter I of Science and the\nModern World. Whether, in finding out what is, a qualitative or a quan-\ntitative method of experiment is used is merely a matter of common sense\nand not of scientific principle. It is a question of adapting the method to\nthe subject-matter. The idea that science means measurement has arisen\nbecause metrical methods are eminently suitable in physical science ; and\nphysical science has set a fashion in the matter. By introducing statistical\nmethods into psychical research we are not ipso facto rendering it scientific ;\nit can be quite as scientific while using qualitative methods. The question\nis whether statistical methods are best adapted to the elucidation of\npsychical phenomena.\nWith regard to (7), the unprecedented nature of the phenomena we deal\nwith entitles us to ask whether it is true that our task is to work from the\nsimple to the complex. In his introduction to the papers by Mr Whately\nCarington and Mr Soal in Proc, vol. XLVI, p. 28, Professor Broad says\nthat \"if we insist on delivering blind frontal attacks on unanalysed\nproblems of immense complexity, we are likely to share the fate of the\nscholastic physicists \". My difficulty in agreeing with Professor Broad is\nthat I cannot see that we are in the same boat as the scholastic physicists.\nSurely the diiference between our subject-matter and that of any other\nscience (possibly excepting psychology) is such that it carries us a long\nway from precedent. Is it a fact that the richer or more advanced pheno-\nmena of psychical research are more complex than the poorer or more\nelementary.'' I cannot see that they are. The dilTerence does not seem to\nme to be one of complexity but one of poverty or richness, or of goodness\nor badness\u2014the difference between a good specimen of a thing or a bad\none. Is there, again, any reason to suppose that the essential processes\nunderlying paranormal phenomena are complex processes? In telepathy,\nfor example, is the relation between agent and percipient a complex\nrelation? Presumably it must consist of some kind of non-spatial relation\nbetween some factor of the agent's subliminal self and some factor of the\npercipient's subliminal self. We get more light on the nature of this\nrelation by turning to the richer examples of telepathy than to the poorer ;\nand everything seems to me to suggest that the relation is simple. What\ncomplexity there is in a telepathic situation lies in the mode of expression.\nIn as far as we are working from the expression of the extra-sensory\nfaculty towards the essential process, we seem to be working from the\ncomplex to the simple. Our difficulty in understanding this essential\nprocess is not that it is complex but that it is qualitatively new to us. The\ndifficulty is one of unfamiliarity, and arises from the fact that what gives\nrise to telepathy is something of a totally different kind from what we are\naccustomed to in the familiar world. It is a qualitative and not a quanti-\ntative difficulty. Eugene Osty, as a result of his wide acquaintance with\nsensitives producing a rich quality of phenomena, was deeply impressed\nwith this. He says :\n\" The attempt to work from the known to the un-\nknown and from the simple to the complex, as in ordinar}'' science, is but\nto create illusions and to lose time \". One reason for this appears to be\nthat if we leave the marginal phenomena, which the statistical method\ndeals with, and examine the richer phenomena, we find that a far larger\npart is played by individual \" brute fact \" than is the case with the\n\f62 Journal of Society for Psychical Research may-june 1944\nphysical sciences. It seems not unlikely that any laws which we may seem\nto discover among the marginal phenomena will be swamped with excep-\ntions when we come to the depths of the subject. Osty even thought that\nthere are as many different kinds of telepathy as there are human\nbeings!\nWith regard to (8), I would suggest, then, that neither the introduction\nof measurement nor the attempt to work from the simple to the complex\nis likely to take us to the heart of our subject. Perhaps we shall never\nreach the heart of it ; but I would suggest that we are likely to advance\nfurthest towards it by examining the best phenomena we can find and by\nfreely using qualitative methods. We can of course always introduce\nstatistics to evaluate chance if there is any advantage in doing so. Our\ngreatest difficulty, as I see it, is not that of analysing complex situations\ninto their elements, or of building up a synthetic theory out of information\ngathered piecemeal. It is that of trying to accustom our minds to pheno-\nmena which are simple hut utterly strange. From one point of view we are\nin the position of a zoologist who wants to form an idea of what some\nprehistoric animal was like. Clearly he will do better to study a complete\nfossil skeleton, if there is one, rather than piece together information\ngathered from fragments. The reaching out of the mind to form new ideas\nis the attitude of the explorer. There is the opposite attitude, which seeks\nto draw back a strange phenomenon into the orbit of familiar ideas and to\nmake it immediately logical in terms of them. The latter attitude w ould,\nI think, stultify all progress in psychical research.\nAnyone who points out the predominantly qualitative nature of para-\nnormal phenomena is sure to be accused of trying to \" debunk \" the\nstatistical method. I would say, for the first five reasons given above,\ntherefore, that I believe the statistical method to be very important and\none that should be energetically pursued. I cannot, however, see that it\nis applicable to the major phenomena of the subject. By its very nature\nit seems to be adapted for exploring the normal-paranormal borderline :\nfor one thing it deals with faint impressions occurring in an almost normal\nstate of consciousness. But in its own field, owing to its sensitivity, it\nacts like a magnifying-glass.\nI have no space in which to outline a possible programme of qualitative\nresearch ; but the field is obviously immense, and I suggest that our\nSociety should run statistical and qualitative research in double harness,\ngiving equal attention to both.\nG. N. M. Tyrrell\nCORRESPONDENCE\nSir,\u2014May I be allowed to congratulate Mrs Goldney, Mr Soal and B.S.\non their well devised experiments reported in Part 167 of Proceedings.\nThey have presented \" cast iron \" evidence of the existence of E.S.P.\nunder conditions acceptable to the most sceptical critic.\nI have no criticism to make of the experimental technique, but I should\nlike to make one or two observations on the conclusions drawn by the\nexperimenters.\n\fMAY-JUNE 1944 Correspondence 63\nAll the work done on psychical research shows that the \" psi \" faculty\nis a product of the unconscious mind on the part both of the agent and\npercipient. In the case of the percipient (whether he be a medium at a\nspiritualistic sitting or a subject in a laboratory experiment) significant\nmaterial, together with a mass of chance guesses, just \" appears \" in his\nconscious mind. He is unable to say from where it comes, he is unable to\nselect the significant from the chance material and to a large extent he is\nunable to state the physical and mental conditions and environment most\nfavourable to the appearance of the significant material in his conscious\nmind. Much the same conditions exist in the case of the agent, he is\nunable to say which of his thoughts have been \" transmitted \", he is\nunable to state why he is a good agent with one percipient and a bad one\nwith another, and so on, but there is one fact that he can fairly safely\ndepend on and that is that those thoughts which are \" transmitted \" are\nunconscious thoughts. It is rare that a medium is able to give, without\ndifficulty, evidential names or facts present in the sitter's conscious mind\nalthough forgotten facts and names are given in abundance (I have often\nbeen upbraided by a medium for thinking too hard of an evidential fact\nthat she is trying to produce). Similarly, the work of Thouless, Whately\nCarington, Soal, Goldney and others shows that the percipient scores on\ncard symbols that are not at the forefront of the agent's conscious mind.\nNow let us examine, in the recent experiments, the results obtained with\nB.S. and the particular agent with whom he obtained minus one hits.\nThe following facts can be abstracted ; (\u00ab) B.S. does not draw upon\ninformation present in the forefront of the conscious mind of the agent ;\n(6), a minimum speed (normal calling rate) is necessary to enable him to\nscore significantly ;\n(c), the agent must look at the cards.\nDealing first with {a) we see that B.S. ignores the \" contemporary\n\"\ncard as would be expected, but he does not score indiscriminately on the\nother forty-nine, but only on the card before (the precognitive effect is\ndiscussed later). As an example, let the contemporary card be the ele-\nphant, the agent will have a picture of the elephant in mind and will\nattempt to \" transmit \" it to B.S. The card before the elephant, say\nthe pelican, was looked at approximately three seconds ago and its mental\nimage has already receded to the fringe of consciousness, the card before\nthe pelican (looked at approximately six seconds ago) has receded even\nfurther from consciousness and so on back through the cards already\ncalled. We are forced to the conclusion that the image of the card looked\nat three seconds ago has receded to the optimum (and perhaps the only)\nlevel in consciousness for \" transmission \".\nTurning now to {b) we find that B.S. can only score significantly when\nthere is a certain time interval between presentations. If this interval is\nmore than approximatelv three seconds no significant score is obtained.\nNow we have seen from the paragraph above that B.S. does not, at the nor-\nmal scoring rate, score significantly on minus two cards because these\ncards have passed, by three seconds, the optimum level in the conscious-\nness of the agent. If the scoring rate is reduced, the card before the\ncontemporary was looked at more than three seconds ago, and at the word\n\" right \" from \" EA \" there is no card in the optimum level of the agent's\nconsciousness and hence B.S. is unable to score. We can see from (c) that\n\f64 Journal of Society for Psychical Research may-june 1944\nit is definitely the mind of the agent that is read and that B.S. has no\nclairvoyant faculty.\nIt is to be noticed that B.S. only succeeds with some subjects, a fact\nwhich may be explained in two ways. Firstly, it may be that the image of\nthe card takes more or less than three seconds to reach the \" optimum\nlevel \", in which case a different normal scoring rate is necessary (this\nrequires experimental check), or secondly, it may be that no \" optimum\nlevel \" exists in unsuccessful agents. From experiments conducted\n(myself as percipient and using Zener symbols) between a friend and\nmyself it appears that it takes an image about half a minute to reach my\nfriend's \" optimum level \" as my significant scores were postcognitive\nby half a minute.\nOf all the adequately demonstrated ways in which the E.S.P. faculty\nmanifests itself, I find precognition the most diflicult to swallow. There\nis no doubt that B.S. obtains a plus one significant score but the mass of\ntime dimensions and observers necessary to explain this on, for example,\nJ. W. Dunne's precognition hypothesis are not capable of any sort of\ndemonstration or proof. The facts of psychic research show that the\npercipient reads the agent's mind and we are therefore forced to the\nconclusion that images of the plus one cards are present at the \" optimum\nlevel \" of those agents with whom B.S. scores significantly. To explain\nthe presence of these plus one images in the mind of the agents we can\nassume, either that the agents have precognitive powers (of which we have\nno proof) or that unconscious telepathy takes place between the agents and\nthe individual who drew up the list of random numbers for the experi-\nments (the counters experiments are considered below). As we have very\ngood evidence of the existence of telepathy and its unconscious nature, I\nfind it more reasonable to adopt the latter of the two foregoing assump-\ntions. To give an example, let us assume Soal, acting as EA drew up the\nlist of random numbers being used in any particular experiment. At the\nstart of the experiment the agent is not aware of the order of the five\ncards in front of him and is not aware of the contents of the list of random\nnumbers. Soal is aware, unconsciously, of the list of random numbers\nbut not of the order of the five cards. After the first few calls of a run of\nfifty, the agent will have seen all the five cards and will therefore know\ntheir order unconsciously if not consciously. We now have a state of\naffairs in which Soal and the agent know between them the order of the\ncards and if Soal's knowledge of the order of the numbers in the list of\nrandom numbers is passed, by telepathy, to the agent, the latter is aware\nof the plus one card, and it appears, from the scores obtained by B.S.,\nthat this card is at the \" optimum level \". This hypothesis can be checked\n(at any rate in part) by a re-examination of the scoring sheets of the Soal-\nGoldney experiments. If it is found that B.S. scores a significant number\nof plus one hits in the first five calls (this means getting a minimum of\nthree plus one hits in the first five calls) then precognition will have to be\npostulated to explain the results, if however, this is not the case the\nunconscious telepathy theory comes to the fore.\nIn attempting to explain the precognitive effect observed in the\n\" counters \" experiments it is necessary to assume that Mrs Goldney (or\nother person selecting the counters from the bowl or bag) is able to\n\fMAY-JUNE 1944 Correspondence 65\ndetermine the colour of all or some of the counters by touch. Again I\nprefer this assumption to precognition, especially as there is some evidence\nfor the discrimination of objects by touch.\nOn page 52 of the report Mrs Goldney explains that to attain the normal\nscoring speed of B.S. she used both hands to select the counters. While\nshowing the contemporary counter at the screen with, say, her left hand she\nwas selecting the next counter with her right. In other words she may\nbecome aware of the colour of the plus one counter while presenting the\ncontemporary counter at the screen aperture. If this information is passed,\nby telepathy, to the agent, he or she becomes aware of the plus one card,\nits image being at the \" optimum level \".\nIt does appear, at first sight, that this hypothesis is put out of court by\nthe plus two significant scoring obtained during the rapid run counters\nexperiment. The claim that Mrs Goldney becomes aware of the colour\nof the counters at the surface of the bag, unconsciously, and that she forms\na choice (also unconsciously) of the colour that she intends to select two\n\" guesses \" ahead is extravagant. But is it as extravagent as the claim that\nfuture events can be cognised in the present?\nA word now about \" multiply-determined \" guesses. With one agent\nB.S. obtained both plus and minus one significant scores and it would\nappear, therefore, that with this particular agent both the plus and minus\none images are at the optimum level in consciousness for \" transmission\n\"\nto B.S. If both the plus one and minus one cards are, say elephants, we\nshould expect the two images which are both at the optimum level to aid\neach other in \" transmission \". With the other two agents it would appear\nthat the plus one image is in a slightly more favourable level for \" trans-\nmission \" than the minus one image, but in a \" multiply-determined\n\"\n\"guess the minus one image mav be in a sufficiently favourable position in\nconsciousness to aid the image (plus one) at the \" optimum level \".\nIt can be seen quite plainly that doubling the scoring rate should pro-\nduce plus two significant hits. We koow that with the successful approxi-\nmately three seconds is required by them for the card image to reach their\n\" optimum level \". If the cards are presented at the rate of one every\none and a half seconds a time interval of three seconds represents two cards\nand we should expect the scoring to shift from plus and minus one to\nplus and minus two cards.\nIt will be seen that the hypothesis of an \" optimum level \" shifts the time\ndisplacement scoring ability from the percipient to the agent. B.S. can only\ndraw his knowledge of the cards from a certain level in the unconscious\nmind of the agent. The hypothesis suggests a new line of attack in E.S.P.\nexperiments. Instead of trying, as has always been done in the past, the\neffect of various drugs on the percipient, I suggest that the drugs should be\nadministered to the agent and the effect on the scoring noted. On the face\nof it, it appears that stimulants should increase the time displacement\neffect while depressants should do the opposite. However, in the absence\nof data it is unwise to speculate too far.\nYours faithfully,\nJ. M. Harrison\n\f66 Journal of Society for Psychical Research may-june 1944\nMr Soal writes : I can follow Mr J. M. Harrison quite easily when he\nsuggests than an image can be transmitted only when it has reached a\ncertain level below the Agents' threshold of consciousness. At the present\ninstant the Agent is looking, say, at an elephant but three seconds ago he\nwas visualising a pelican. The image of the pelican has, during the three\nseconds, sunk just sufficiently below the threshold and reached a state in\nwhich it has the best chance of being apprehended by the Percipient. But\nwhile this suggestion might throw some light on the ^o^f-cognitive successes\nI fail to see how it helps us to understand the ^recognitive guessing. Let\nus say that E.A. is showing the number 4 at the little aperture in the screen\nand that the next number on his prepared list is 5. According to Mr\nHarrison this number 5 is transmitted telepathically to the subconscious\nmind of the Agent who, knowing already the order of the pictures in the\nbox, now possesses subconsciously the knowledge that in three seconds'\ntime he will be looking at (say) the elephant. B.S. then presumably reads\nthe Agents' mind. But in the first place why should the number 5 have\nany better chance of being transmitted than say the number which follows\nit on the list which we will suppose to be 3. While he is showing the 4,\nE.A.'s eye might just as easily light on the 5 as on the 3. Indeed when the\ninterval between calls is halved it is the 3 and not the 5 which is apparently\ntransmitted to the Agent. Since, according to Mr Harrison, these tele-\npathic transmissions occur at the instant when E.A. is presenting the\nnumber 4, what difference can the alteration in the time interval make in\nthe case of the ^re-cognitive guesses?^\nMr Harrison suggests as a check on his theory that we might discover\nthat B.S. failed to score significantly on the first few calls of each new sheet\nowing to the Agent's lack of opportunity for learning the order of the cards\nin the box. A fair test would be to compare the rate of scoring on the\nfirst four guesses of the {a) columns (during which the Agent is progres-\nsively learning the order of the five cards in the box) with that on the first\nfour guesses of the [b) column (at which stage the order is completely\nknown). Taking for instance Group I Agent's at Normal Rate we have\nthe following table :\n( + i) Hits on first 4 ( + i) Hits on first 4\ntrials of (a) columns trials of (b) columns Totals\nWhence with Yates' correction we find =0-378.\nThus there is no significant difference, and so far as it goes the result does\nnot support Mr Harrison's hypothesis. Even on the first tivo trials or on\nt\\\\t first trial alone there is no significant difference between the {a) and {b)\ncolumns.\nIn order to explain the ( + 2) Precognitive successes at \" rapid \" rate\nwhen counters were drawn from a bowl (or bag) Mr Harrison has to fall\n1 Mr Harrison's theory seems to suggest that there is an optimum moment for\ntelepathic transmission of the number shortly before (as well as after) the moment\nof conscious attention upon presenting it at the aperture : the intention of E.A. to\npresent each successive number can be conceived as reaching this optimum level,\nsay 3 sees, before the intention is carried out.

(Mrs Goldney) selects unconsciously\n(by touch) the counter which she is going to draw two \" calls \" ahead. I\nfind it hard to credit the suggestion that Mrs Goldney possesses a touch\nsensitive enough to distinguish the pigments on smooth bone counters\nall of identical size, shape and weight. \" Marion \", the vaudeville\n\" telepathist \", could pick out a playing card which he had previously felt\nwhen mixed with five others in the dark. But he relied on the detection\nof slight variations in flexibility and he was quite unable to distinguish\nbetween a red pip and a black pip. I find it simply incredible that Mrs\nGoldney should be able to make these delicate discriminations at the\ntremendous speed with which the experiments were conducted.\nIt would in fact be much simpler to suggest that Mrs Goldney really\nsees the counters in the bowl without being consciously aware of the fact\nand decides upon her ( + 2) choice by sight. But why should she have\ndone this on the first occasion the experiment was tried\u2014at which time\nnone of us even suspected that a ( + 2) displacement was going to occur?\nBut even the \" selection by sight \" hypothesis has its difliculties for on two\noccasions at least the counters were drawn from a cloth bag by touch alone.\nOn one of these occasions Miss Jephson selected the counters from a cloth\nbag using one hand only.\nI fully agree with Mr Harrison that \" clairvoyance \" (in the ordinary\nsense) is a very improbable explanation but neither Mrs Goldney nor I\nshare his aversion to the idea of \" precognition \". Surely, as Mr Salt-\nmarsh pointed out, there is a very respectable collection of spontaneous\ncases of prevision many of which would appear to be inexplicable by\nordinary telepathy or even clairvoyance. Personally I conjecture that if\nthe ^i\/-faculty transcends the limitations of space it probably also tran-\nscends those of Time since Time and Space are so intimately connected\nin most modern theories of the physical Universe.\nIt seems to me that the only way in which we could definitely settle the\nquestion as to whether the results of our experiments are to be attributed to\nprecognition would be to select the random numbers by means of a machine.\nAt present we can only suggest that \" telepathic precognition \" is still the\nmost economical hypothesis and neither Mrs Goldney nor I would wish\nto claim more than this.\nYours etc.,\n'.\nS.

London : Faber and\nFaber. Pp. 79. Price 5s. net.\nThe publication of this little book is of peculiar interest to all students of\npsychical research for, as we are told in the preface it is, with slight\nemendation, the text of a thesis which was accepted by the Faculty of\nMedicine of the University of Cambridge for the degree of Doctor of\nMedicine. Only those who do not know the story of our long struggle for\nrecognition of our work by the world of science can fail to realize the\nsignificance of this statement. The acceptance by the Faculty of Medicine\nof any British University of Dr Bendit's first sentence\n\u2014\" I am beginning\nthis paper with the assumption that Paranormal cognition (P.C. for short)\nis a fact\n\"\u2014is in itself sufficient to show the changed attitude in recent\nyears of academic science to psychical research.\nIn discussing Paranormal Cognition the convenient term Psi or Psi\nfunction, suggested by Dr Thouless, is adopted throughout to indicate the\nparticular form of P.C. that we meet with in telepathy, clairvoyance etc.\nas opposed to such Paranormal Cognition as may be due to hyperacuity\nof the normal senses. Readers who are conversant with the Society's work\non this topic as set forth in our Proceedings znA Journal will find themselves\non familiar ground throughout the greater part of the book. A new angle\nof approach, however, may be found in considering the implications of the\noccurrence of P.C. in the course of psychotherapeutic treatment ; Dr\nBendit records some of his own clinical experiences in which Psi pheno-\nmena were observed. But he rightly points out the difficulty and danger\nof trying to combine therapy with psychical research. Most of the cases\ncited are not put forward as having evidential value but they serve the\nwriter's purpose of illustrating the various types of Psi function that may\nbe met with.\nPerhaps the most interesting part of Dr Bendit's book is the last section\nin which he tries to assess the biological and evolutionary significance of\nPsi. In an admirable discussion of the problems involved he asks : is\nPsi \" to be considered as a relatively new development of the mind, or is\nit, in present day civilised man, a vestige of something outgrown and\nbiologically useless? Or, on the other hand, is it perhaps today a function\nwhich should develop pari passu with the rest of the mind from some\narchaic and protopathic root into an epicritic form which serves a teleo-\nlogical end?\n\"\nDr Bendit rejects the suggestion that Psi may be regarded as a relatively\nnew development of the mind and he puts forward some evidence which\nsuggests that Psi has its roots in evolutionary antiquity. But although he\naccepts its archaic origin, he does not think that it is a vestige of something\noutgrown and biologically useless when it manifests in present day civilised\nman. Rather does he believe that Psi is \" a function which should develop\npari passu with the rest of the mind \". This seems to imply a reflection\non the success of the evolutionary process so far as it has gone, for if it\nshould have so developed from the beginning the general abseaice of overt\n\fMAY-JUNE 1944 Reviews 69\nPsi function in civilised man would point to its not having done so. But\nDr Bendit thinks that it is not even now too late and he looks forward to\na time when Psi function may become integrated with the ego and prove\nto be an asset in the conduct of everyday life.\nT. W. M.\nAfter Pentecost. The Alexandrian Chronicle of Cleophas. Written by the\nhand of Geraldine Cummins. Rider & Co., 9s. 6d. net.\nIn his introduction to this book Miss E. B. Gibbes claims that Miss\nCummins is only the amanuensis, the real author being the Spirit of Cleo-\nphas {; identical with the Cleopas of Lk. xxiv, 18). In his previous revela-\ntions through Miss Cummins' hand \" Cleophas \" undertook to elucidate\nthe drama of primitive Christianity in Athens, Ephesus, and Rome. Here\nhe concerns himself with the Church in Alexandria, and with its Jewish\nand Pagan environment. We are introduced to Jewish pogroms, self-\ntorturing Jewish ascetics, penitent harlots, and Christian missionaries\npatiently enduring the cruelty of those they seek to convert to their faith\nin Christ as Logos and Messiah. St. Mark, whom earlv tradition makes\nthe first Bishop of Alexandria, and St. John are shewn in friendly relations\nwith Philo, the famous Jewish mystical commentator on the Pentateuch,\nwho for the first time is revealed to us as inclined to acknowledge the truth\nof Christiainity, though held back by old prejudices and fear of his co-\nreligionists.\nThe Rev. John Lammond, D.D. is quoted by Miss Gibbes as testifying\nthat, if we refuse to accept the Spiritualist explanation of Miss Cummins'\nscript, only \" a careful study of the literary sources \" by her can account\nfor it ; but she has never studied \" Early Church History \" or \" ancient\nGreek and Pagan thought \".\nIs it necessary to assume vast erudition as an alternative to the hypo-\nthesis of spirit-control.'' The subconscious mind seems capable of\nabsorbing and retaining masses of facts seen, heard, or read, and latent\npowers of weaving these into a plausible romance may emerge in the\nmediumistic state. Could not a good knowledge of the New Testament,\nand a certain acquaintance with the w-orks of Josephus and Eusebius'\nEcclesiastical History be responsible for most of the historical features of\nthis book?\nWhile there is nothing in Miss Cummins' script that may not be reason-\nably attributed to the operations of her subliminal self, it contains state-\nments no Jew of Alexandria or Palestine, contemporary with St. Paul,\ncould have made. We are told quite correctly that there was a large\nsynagogue in Alexandria. But this \" mighty synagogue \" is absurdly\nequated with \" the great Temple which was in splendour second only to\nthe Temple at Jerusalem \"\n(p. 23). Cleophas must have known, though\nMiss Cummins may not, that a synagogue and a temple are very dift'erent\nbuildings. There was no Jewish temple in Alexandria. The only Jewish\ntemple in Egypt of the first century of our era was at Heliopolis.\nEusebius' Ecclesiastical History may have introduced her to the Thera-\npeutae, an Egyptian version of the Essenes of Palestine. But though\nboth Philo of Alexandria and Eusebius have presented the Therapeutae as\n\f7\u00b0 Jownal of Society for Psychical Research may-june 1944\na fraternity of ascetics, neither of these authors can be quoted for the\nhideous self-tortures described in the present script, which are remini-\nscent of Christian hermits and Hindu sanydsis.\nJudas the Therapeut seems to be an echo of Judas the Essene, the\nProphet introduced to us by Josephus [Antiq. xiii, xi, 2), but we seek in\nvain from the Jewish historian for any trace of Rabab, also a Therapeut of\nsome fame, whose adventures and backslidings interest Cleophas so deeply.\nIn Chap, xvii we read of \" Petronius, Governor of Jerusalem \", secretly\nvisiting St. John. There was a Publius Petronius, Governor of Syria,\nwhom the mad Emperor Caligula sent with an army against the Jews to\ncompel them to set up his image in the Temple. This Petronius, who is\ncertainly the one described in the script, could not properly be described as\n\" Governor of Jerusalem \". The \" Governor of Jerusalem \" would be\nthe \" Procurator of Judea \", who served under the Emperor's representa-\ntive in Syria. The only Procurator of Judea contemporary with Petronius\nwas Marullus (a.d. 37-41 ). After his term of office Judea passed under the\nrule of Herod Agrippa I until a.d. 44. On the death of Agrippa it was\nagain subject to Procurators until the outbreak of the Jewish war against\nRome.\nMany things are told in the Cleophas script of St. John's Life in Alex-\nandria, of his miracles, his encounters with the hitherto unknown Irinus\nthe Wrestler, and his conversations with the aged Philo. Strange that not\nonly the New Testament but all the Fathers of the Church, and the early\nChristian historians, should tell us nothing of this important phase of St.\nJohn's missionary career ! Tertullian mentions his being rescued from a\ncauldron of boiling oil in Rome. Eusebius relates a number of legends\nabout St. John, all of them connected with Ephesus. Apart from the\nCleophas script, what grounds have we for believing that St. John was\never in Alexandria?\nCleophas is quite innocent of Higher Criticism. An appendix tells us\nof a weird book \" written before Genesis \", which was \" kept back from\nthe people \" (that would appear to be the reason why we have heard noth-\ning of it until now). Miss Cummins (or Cleophas) do not seem to know that\nGenesis is composed of at least three documents, which can be traced in\nother books of the Pentateuch, and that its literary growth covers a very\nlong period, not being completed before the fifth century B.C. or later.\nShe (or her spirit informer) takes quite seriously the forged correspondence\nof Jesus and Abgarus King of Edessa, who in the script is made to talk\nlike a Christian. The first Christian King of Edessa was Abgarus VHI\n(a.d. 176-213). While Cleophas betrays a surprising acquaintance with\nthe Authorised Version of the English Bible, his theological thinking and\nphrasing are more suited to a Gnostic of the second century a.d. than to a\nJew of the first (see especially Appendix HI, p. 108).\nA.

It occurred to Mrs Dick-Cunyngham, and was brought\nto notice through the good offices of Mr Douglas Fawcett.\nThe vision seen was of Mr Eustace Neville Craig, a close friend of Mrs\nDick-Cunyngham. The latter, writing to Mr Fawcett recently, said in\nreference to her experience : \"I did not even know that he had been\nsuddenly taken ill (operation). One Sunday I had gone to church in\nLondon with my mother. Suddenly I got the clearest vision I have ever\nseen. It was like a shutter opened slowly and then closed again slowly.\nFor two seconds I saw Eustace lying quite motionless on a bed. His eyes\nwere closed, he was as white as a sheet. There were two nurses in white\ncaps ; one was advancing holding a glass of medicine. Then the vision\nvanished. I came home and said to Dickson [her maid], T believe Mr\nCraig is ill '. The following Tuesday his death was in the Times. After-\nwards I heard he had never recovered consciousness after an operation.\"\nIn reply to a request for further details, Mrs Dick-Cunyngham wrote:\n\fSEPT.-OCT. 1944 Case : Apparition 73\nThe Empress Club,\n35, Dover Street,\nAugust 26th, 1943.

Funeral at Ham Common\nChurchyard, Surrey, on Wednesday at noon.\nIt appears from this that the vision took place between 11 a.m. and\n12.30 p.m. on Sunday, May 15th 1932, and the death sometime on the\nprevious day, Saturday, May 14th.\n\f74 Journal of Society for Psychical Research sept.-oct. 1944\nThis case bears a striking similarity to the older cases in the Society's\ncollection. The phrases, \" the clearest vision I have ever seen \", and,\n\" though so long ago I remember it as if it had occurred yesterday \" echo\nalmost verbally the comments of many bygone percipients with regard to\nthe vividness and impressiveness of their experiences.\nThe vision possessed, also, two special features : (i) On the first\noccasion it appeared in a special space of its own (cf. Case in Proceedings,\nvol. X, p. 371 ; and Case 200 in Phantasms of the Living). (2) It emerged\nout of a bright spot or cloud (see Journal, vol. XIX, p. 45 ; and Phantasms\nof the Living, vol. I, p. 527). But on the second occasion it appeared in\nphysical space. There is a popular tendency to believe that an apparition\nwhich appears in physical space, and takes its normal place among the\nsurroundings, must be in some sense more really \" there \" than an\napparition which appears in a special space of its own, or appears in a\ndream. But the apparent indifference of apparitions to the kind of space\nthey appear in would seem to negative this belief. The kind of spatial\nsetting is surely merely part of the chosen dramatic form given to the\nfigure: it is not evidence that an apparition is personally present when it\nappears in one kind of space and not when it appears in another kind.\nThe present case falls exactly into line with previous cases in this respect.\nMrs Dick-Cunyngham has kindly given permission for the real names\nand addresses to be printed.\nA NOTE ON NEGATIVE DEVIATION\nBy S. G. Soal\nOn pp. 192\u2014193 of rriy paper Fresh Light on Card-Guessing {Proceedings,\nPart 162), I examined an interesting case of below-chance scoring obtained\nby the Subject B.S. on (\n- 2) post-cognitive guesses in the year 1936 and\nI advanced certain tentative psychological explanations to account for it.\nIn the more recent work with B.S. reported in Experiments in Precognitive\nTelepathy {Proceedings, Part 167), this particular effect appears to be\nabsent, but Miss Betty Humphrey of the Parapsychological Laboratory\nat Duke University, has drawn my attention to a negative effect which\nruns consistently through the whole of B.S.' work in co-operation with\nthe agent J.Al. This is a highly significant tendency of the Subject to\nscore belo-iv chance on the \" actual \" or \" target \" card, and it appears to\nadmit of a paranormal explanation. In 1936 B.S. ,\nworking mainly, though\nnot exclusively, with the Agent J.Al. obtained a slight but quite insignifi-\ncant positive deviation on the actual (o) presentations and with the Agents\nR.E. and G.A. in 1941 he obtained likewise an unimportant positive\ndeviation. It is very surprising therefore, to note this negative deviation\nwith the Agent J.Al. during the years 1942-1943. The tendency to score\nbelow chance expectation occurs not only in the experiments carried out\nat \" normal rate \" but likewise during those at \" rapid \" tempo.\nIf the reader will turn to Experiments in Precognitive Telepathy (List of\nScores : Sittings 31-40) he will find under the columns headed (\" o \")\nample evidence of the tendency to score below expectation. Omitting the\nexperiment on 7 August '42 at which no agent was present, the experiment\n\fSEPT.-OCT. 1944 A Note on Negative Deviation 75\nwith Zener cards on 26 August '42 and three columns in which non-\nrandom sequences were employed we have under the heading \" o \" 69\ncolumns of 25 presentations equivalent to 1,725 trials. The expected\nnumber of correct hits is 3 x 1725 = 345, whereas the observed number is\nonly 281. There is thus a deficiency on the \" actual card \" of 64 hits - the\nequivalent of 3-85 standard deviations. Of the 69 columns 23 were guessed\nat \" rapid \" rate and the remainder at \" normal \" rate. The columns at\n\"normal\" rate show significant ( + 1) or (-1) displacement hits and\nthose at \" rapid \" tempo ( +2) or (\n- 2) displacements.\nNow it is well known that most subjects tend to change their guess\nfrom one symbol to another more frequently than would occur in a\nrandom sequence of the digits 1-5 compiled from mathematical tables.\nIn a truly random series of n + i guesses we should expect on an average\n|h changes of guess. In what follows in experiments at \" normal \" rate\na \" change of guess \" will be understood to mean a change of symbol in\npassing from any one guess to the next but in the \" rapid \" experiments it\nwill mean a change of symbol from any one guess to the next but one.\nBy the term \" precognitive hit \" I mean a ( + i) hit in columns guessed\nat normal rate but a ( + 2) hit in columns guessed at \" rapid \" rate. In\norder to make the most of our material ( + i) and ( + 2) hits will be lumped\ntogether in the ensuing discussion.\nIf the Subject scores a ( + i) precognitive hit at \" normal \" speed or\na ( + 2) precognitive hit at \" rapid \" rate and follows this by a \" change of\nguess \" he will clearly get the actual card ivrong\u2014that is the card which\ncorresponds contemporaneously to his changed guess. If therefore a\nperson scored significant ( + i) or ( +2) hits and changed his guess more\nfrequently than if he were guessing randomly this in itself would tend to\ngenerate a \" below-chance \" score on the \" actual \" or \" o \" card, and no\nfurther explanations might be necessary.\nNow after the 1633 \" precognitive \" trials B.S. changes his guess 1361\ntimes, whereas in a random sequence the expected number of changes is\n1306-4. B.S. therefore shows a highly significant tendency to \" change\nguess \".\nWe must next examine how he distributes these changes of guess\nfollowing (i) precognitive successes and (ii) precognitive failures. This\nmay be shown by the following contingency table.\n1633 Precognitive Trials\nNo. of\nprecognitive\nGuesses correct\nNo. of\nprecognitive\nGuesses incorrect\nTotals\nCases followed by change\nof Guess - - -\n425 936 1361\nCases followed by no\nchange of Guess -\n54 218 272\nTotals -\n479 \"54 1633\n\f76 Journal of Society for Psychical Research sept.-oct. 1944\nAfter making Yates' correction we find for this table = 13-6 (a highly\nsignificant result). An inspection of this table shows quite clearly that B.S.'\nchanges of guess are not distributed randomly but occur most frequently\nafter he has scored a precognitive success. In fact after the ii54precog-\nnitive failures he changes his guess 936 times, which is not significantly\ndifferent from the 923 changes to be expected in a random sequence.\nOn the other hand after the 479 successful precognitive trials he changes\nguess 425 times as against the 383-2 expected in a random distribution.\nNow considering the \" actual card \" successes which follow precog-\nnitive successes we should, if the change of guess were distributed ran-\ndomly over the whole work, expect to record: 479-^^^ ^479 hits on\n\" o \"=79-8, whereas actually there are only 54. Thus there is a defi-\nciency equal to 25-8 - the equivalent of about 2-9 standard deviations.\nIt is easy to suggest a motive for this \" change of guess \" after a succes-\nful precognitive hit. We may assume that the subconscious mind of the\nSubject knows when it has \" got through \" a successful precognitive hit\non a given ( + i) or ( + 2) card. It also knows that at the next guess (or\nnext but one) if it does not change its guess it will score on the \" actual\n\"\ncard. But it is anxious to avoid scoring direct hits and is aiming generally\nat precognitive or postcognitive successes. Quite naturally therefore it\ntries a change of symbol after a successful precognitive hit.\nThe observed number of \" actual \" or \" o \" successes which follow\nprecognitive failures is 201 as compared with an expected number = ^\nX 1\n154 nearly = 230-8. This gives a deficiency of 29-8 or the equivalent\nof about 2-2 standard deviations. This negative deviation is not very\nsignificant, but if it is really genuine we might account for it by a similar\nexplanation to the one put forward on p. 193 of Fresh Light on Card-\nGuessing. We might suppose that after a precognitive failure the correct\ncard image is present in the percipient's subconscious mind but has not\nsucceeded in getting over the threshold. At his next guess this \" correct\n\"\nimage continues to worry the Subject who, in order to exorcise it, avoids\nthis particular symbol and chooses one of the other four.\nThe total number of observed successes on the actual \" o \" presenta-\ntions =54 +201 = 255. It will be seen that this total differs by 26 from\nthe grand total of 281 \" actual \" card successes quoted at the commence-\nment of this note. The difference is accounted for by noting that an\nactual hit which heads a column at \" normal \" rate or which occupies\nplaces I or 2 in a column at \" rapid \" rate cannot be included in the above\nanalysis since such hits do not follow precognitive trials. It is, however,\ninteresting to observe that on the 92 such \" o \" trials we obtain 26 sac-\ncesses as compared with an expectation of 18-4. This group therefore\nshows no tendency to negative deviation as might be expected, since it is\nfree from the psychological mechanisms described above.\nThe more general question is : Are negative deviations on the \"actual\ncard \" always accompanied by displacement, or are there cases of negative\nscoring which exhibit no displacement? It is important for us to know\nthe answer and I much hope that those experimenters who have recorded\nbelow-chance scores will re-examine their records for possible displace-\nment effects.\n\fSEPT.-OCT. 1944 Fallacies in a Criticism of E.S.P. Assessment 77\nFALLACIES IN A CRITICISM OF E.S.P. ASSESSMENT\nV By Donald J. West\nIn a book entitled Beware Familiar Spirits by John Mulholland (pub-\nlished 1938, Charles Scribner and Sons, New York and London), there\noccurs a criticism of the statistical basis of Rhine's E.S.P. experiments,\nwhich seems to have escaped notice and to have remained unanswered.\nIn collaboration with Professor Pitkin, Mulholland begins his attack on\ntheoretical grounds (p. 221). The main argument seems to be that, since\nruns of successes of any size may be found anywhere in an infinitely large\nchance series of trials, no run of success which is observed in a limited\nnumber of trials is incompatible with the hypothesis that the observed\ntrials form part of an infinitely large chance series. Theoretically, this\nproposition is undoubtedly true, but it can be shown by sampling statistics\nwith what frequencies varying degrees of success will be expected to turn\nup in finite random samples, and some of these frequencies are so small\nthat they can be safely neglected for all practical purposes. Thus, if an\nexperimenter assumes that all experiments yielding a -oi level of signifi-\ncance are not the result of chance, he will be right 99 times out of a\nhundred, which is good enough for practical purposes. The same argu-\nment could be applied to every scientific experiment, for every observation,\nwhether evaluated statistically or not, could, in the last resort, be due to\ncoincidence.\nIn an endeavour to obtain some experimental support for their argu-\nment, Mr Mulholland and Professor Pitkin commissioned the Inter-\nnational Business Machines Corporation to produce 'a random sequence\nof 200,000 cards bearing the numbers i to 5 in equal proportions. These\nwere divided into two groups of 100,000 and paired ofi' so as to produce\na series of 100,000 \" mechanical E.S.P.\" trials. As Mr Mulholland says,\n\" Just as with Dr Rhine's test there was one chance in five of the pairs of\ndigits in any given line being the same\u2014that is matching. But with our test\nthere was no possible chance of mind reading or clairvoyance as a factor.\"\nStatisticians say that it is exceedingly difficult to produce a pure random\nsequence mechanically, especially if the method entails the shuffling of\ncards, so that we have some reason to distrust the reliability of Mr Mul-\nholland's shuffle, no details of which are revealed. However, we can\naccept provisionally that the series really represents 100,000 chance trials\nand proceed to examine Mr Mulholland's figures.\nHere again we are confronted with the difficulty of insufficient informa-\ntion. Instead of the raw figures being presented in the usual form, all\nthat is given is a series of incomplete statements, from which the reader\nhas to deduce what the observations really were. The statements may be\ndealt with one by one.\n(i) p. 225. \" There were as many as 32 lines of figures in sequence\nwithout one matching pair \". This statement means that a run of 32\nfailures has been found somewhere in the series. The expectation of\nruns containing r failures in sequence in a series of N trials, where the\nprobability of an individual failure is p, is given by the formula E =\nNp''(i -p)2. Substituting, we find that the expectation of runs of 32\n\f78 Journal of Society for Psychical Research SEPT.-OCT. 1944\nfailures in the present series is 100,000 (4\/5)^^^(1\/5)^ = 3'2. It is surprising,\ntherefore, that Mr Mulholland should be surprised to find one such run\nin his series.\n(2).\n\" Runs of 5 matching pairs in sequence fell 25% below theoretical\nfrequency, while runs of 6 rose to 25% above theoretical frequency. Runs\nof seven jumped still higher to 59% above chance expectancy, and with\nruns of eight we went to 780% above theoretical frequency.\" Now it is\npossible to calculate, from the formula already given, the expectations of\nruns of successes of different sizes and to deduce from the given per-\ncentages what the actual deviations were:\n\u2014\nSize of run Expected frequency Observed frequency\n5 20-5 (20-5 X 75) = 15-4\n6 4-1\nj\n( 4-1 ^ 175)= 5-i|\n7 \u202282 5-o8 ( -82 X 1-59)= 1-3 W-8\n8 \u2022i6j ( -16 X 8-8 )= i-4j\nFractions of runs are meaningless, so we should expect the figures in\nthe observed frequency column to be whole numbers. The fact that they\nare not whole numbers leads me to suspect that Mr Mulholland has,\nwithout mentioning it, calculated his expectations from the formula Np'',\nwhich gives the expectation of runs of r including those contained in\nlarger runs, i.e. a run of (r + a) successes is counted as (a + i) runs of size\nr. Preparing a fresh table on this basis we obtain :\n\u2014\nSize of run Expected frequency Observed frequency\n5 32 24-00\n6 6-4 8-00\n7 1-28 2-03\n8 \u2022256 2-00*\nThis certainly brings the observed frequencies nearer to whole numbers,\nbut whichever table is correct it becomes clear that Mr Mulholland 's per-\ncentages give a very false picture, because the chance expectations are so\nsmall. Moreover, instead of considering runs of all sizes, he has picked\nout the larger ones and examined only the tail of the frequency distri-\nbution, an utterly unjustifiable procedure as the \" tail \" is known to\nbe statistically unreliable. To apply a valid test to the first table,\nit is necessary to combine the last three classes, and when this is done\na value of x^ = 2-8 is obtained, with 2 degrees of freedom, which is insig-\nnificant.\n(3) p. 226. \" In the first forty thousand pairs there were almost three\ntimes as many runs of five as there were in the next sixty thousand.\" It\nwould seem that Mr Mulholland has quite arbitrarily divided his trials\n* Taking 780% above chance as 7-8 x chance expectation.\n\fSEPT.-OCT. 1944 Fallacies in a Criticism of E.S.P. Assessment 79\ninto these unequal groups. One can produce any effect one likes by such\na procedure ; it is a wonder Mr Mulholland could not devise something\nmore startling, but such results will never be comparable with Dr Rhine's\nexperiments, in which all forms of arbitrary selection were most carefully\navoided.\n(4) .\n\" When we arbitrarily selected segments for their high frequency\nof matching pairs, we could find twenty-five and twice twenty-five with\nhalf the pairs matching.\" For myself, it is impossible to tell by inspection\nwhether this observation has any significance, nor do I know of any\nstatistical method to test the point, and I strongly suspect Mr Mulholland\nis in the same position.\n(5) p. 226. Lastly, Mr Mulholland divides the trials into 100 groups\nof 1,000 trials each. In 24 of these groups the matchings came within\n2% of expectation, in 30 the expectation was exceeded by more than 2%,\nwhile in the remaining 46 the successes were more than 2% below expec-\ntation. Apparently the reader is intended to find it surprising that only 24\ncame within 2% of chance expectation.\nThe expectation of successes in a group of 1,000 trials is 200 ; a 2%\ndeviation therefore equals 4, which is -316 times the standard deviation.\nWe can find, from normal distribution tables, what is the expected pro-\nportion of deviations falling outside this range, and the following table\nresults :\n\u2014\nDeviations Expected frequency Observed frequency\n>+4 30 37-5\n\u00b14 24 25-0\n<-4 46 37-5\nIt will be seen that Mr Mulholland's result is in close agreement with\nchance.\nTo conclude, there is little doubt that Mr Mulholland's figures, despite\ntheir superficial impressiveness, show no evidence of any extra-chance\neffect. The only question is whether they were cited as evidence through\nan extreme ignorance of statistical method, or in a deliberate attempt to\nmislead the reader. It is unfortunate that so public a figure as Mr Harry\nPrice seems to have fallen into the trap, for, in his book Fifty Years of\nPsychical Research (p. 182-3), quotes Mr Mulholland's figures at length\nas a cogent argument against E.S.P. experiments.\nCORRESPONDENCE\nSir,\u2014I should be grateful for a few lines of your space in which to\ncomment on Dr Layard's Paper, PSI Phenomena and Poltergeists, in Part\n168 of Proceedings. In the interests of brevity I will confine myself to one\nitem only, namely the first \" case \" which Dr Layard regards as \" eviden-\ntial \"\n(p. 242, bottom) in respect of his views.\nThe gist of this is that a lady in a state of acute mental conflict (I speak\n\f8o Journal of Society for Psychical Research sept.-oct. 1944\nuntechnically) wandered about the streets of Zurich from about 10.30 one\nmorning until 3.0 a.m. the next. At about 9.30 in the evening (p. 245) she\nunderwent an experience which produced, or initiated, at least a temporary\ncure. Shortly after 7.0 p.m. apparently (p. 244, middle) the top of an old\nwooden bench in her physician's consulting room suddenly split. Dr\nLayard contends (p. 246, top) that \"... the breaking of the psychic\ntension which brought about the patient's release was directed in the form\nof message towards the healer, the splitting of the massive bench signi-\nfying the division of differentiation she had at that moment achieved\nbetween the Conscious and the Unconscious \" (My italics).\nThe words \" at that moment \", which greatly add to the dramatic effect,\nappear to be most gratuitously, if not wilfully, misleading ;\nfor, so far as\ncan be ascertained from the record, the bench split some two or two and a\nhalf hours before the process of release was even begun.\nBut even if the coincidence in time were much closer than it seems to\nhave been, I fail to see any shadow of warrant for supposing that there was\nany trace of causal connection whatever between the splitting of the\n\" massive bench \" and the lady's state of mind.\nI am not at all prepared to deny categorically and a priori that \" mind \"\nmay act on \" matter \"\u2014in some sense or other yet to be determined\u2014even\nat a distance, without the usual physiological mechanism intervening. But\nI do say that to assume such action in so extreme a case as this, and then to\nuse this assumption as an \" evidential fact in support of a theory, is to\nindulge in irrationality for which the term \" pseudo-science \" would be all\ntoo flattering.\nYours, etc.,\nWhately Carington\nSir,\u2014I am in favour of the informal wartime Discussion Meetings held\nduring the last few months, in spite of the lowered standard involved in the\nimpromptu nature of the occasions. I do not, however, think I am alone in\nhoping that there is to be no lowering of the standard of publication in\nProceedings, and in regretting the inclusion in the last issue of Dr John\nLayard's \" Psi Phenomena and Poltergeists \".\nThe author in his opening sentence admits \" I come here ... to speak on\na subject . . . which, so far as poltergeists are concerned, I have only\nfleetingly encountered \". This fact does not deter him from stating \" it is\nmy belief that all true poltergeist phenomena, such as are recorded in the\npublications of this Society, are also purposeful and probably occasioned\nby . . . conditions of unresolved tension in the psyche of those involun-\ntarily producing them \". Psychical researchers are familiar with the\ncommonplace of fraudulent poltergeist phenomena being connected with\nthe psychological make-up of the agent, but have not had the opportunities\nthey would welcome of studying the alleged genuine variety. Dr Layard is\nlucky to have encountered them even \" flettingly \" ; but I suggest the\nhappenings described by him should not be included in the category\n\" poltergeist phenomena \" at all.\nDr Layard states that \" as a practising psychologist of the Jungian\nschool I might say that at least half the phenomena dealt with in such a\npractice may, I think, justly be reckoned as coming within the category of\n\fSEPT.-OCT. 1944 Correspondence 81\npsi \". Maybe : and maybe not. I am not objecting to the crack in the\nmassive seat of the gothic wooden bench. After reading that far, my only\nsurprise was that the bench was the only thing that cracked. Incidentally,\nwas the crack a + 2 precognitive crack? It occured apparently shortly after\n7 p.m., whereas the patient's psychological climax which caused it, and\nafter which she can \" begin her homeward way \", occurred it would seem\nabout 9.30 p.m. \" The journey . . . was a long one. Forward progress\nwas not a matter of course. For she still had to follow her nose,\" says\nDr Meier. What happens on the occasions when she doesn't.? A well-\nattested record would be most interesting.\nIt is a pity such happenings and such descriptions found perpetuation in\nProceedings. They belong neither to our subject nor to our standard.\nYours etc.,\nK. M. GOLDNEY\nP.S. I hope Dr Layard will not consider me ungrateful. I derived\nconsiderable diversion and enjoyment from hearing him speak.\nK. M. G.\nSir,\u2014I am grateful to you for allowing me to see the letters of Mr\nCarington and Mrs Goldney, and also to them for putting their points so\nclearly, as they both raise issues of great importance in the study of these\nmatters.\nI must first, however, express my deep regret for the serious typist's\nerror to which they both call attention, namely the typing of the figure 7\n(as it appears on line 26, page 244) instead of 9, thus giving rise to the\napparent discrepancy in time of which both letter-w riters justly complain.\nThis sentence should read \" It was after 9 o'clock when we sat down to\ndinner \", and, since it was during this meal that the bench spUt, this\ncoincides with the time, between 9 and 9.30, of the patient's crucial\nexperience outside the Concert Hall (see p. 245). I apologise deeply, both\nto the readers and to Dr Meier himself, whose account this is, for having\nfailed to notice this error when reading the proofs, and more particularly\nto the letter-writers themselves for having allowed them indeed to\nbe \" misled \"into using expressions they might not otherwise have used.\nThe really mischievous trouble about such mistakes is, unfortunately,\nthat by the raising of false issues the real ones are apt to be obscured, so\nwith relief I now pass on to the really substantial criticisms they both\nmake.\nWith regard to Mrs Goldney's statement that \" psychical researchers are\nfamiliar with the commonplace offraudulent poltergeists phenomena being\nconnected with the psychological make-up of the agent, but have not had\nthe opportunities they would welcome of studying the alleged genuine\nvariety \", this raises, of course, the whole question of unconscious motiva-\ntion, which is what psychotherapy deals vv^ith. It is what we all sufli^er from\nin everyday life, not recognising that most of the misfortunes we meet with\nare unconsciously manufactured by ourselves. The ignorant put these\ndown to \" chance \" or \" circumstance \", but the wise look to themselves.\nThe conscious deceiver is comparatively easy to deal with. It is the\nunconscious deceiver who is the real menace, both to himself and others,.\n\f82 Journal of Society for Psychical Research sept.-oct. 1944\nbut such is the materiaUsm of our day that, in rejecting the fraudulent\npersons who use consciously fraudulent methods to produce fake\npoltergeists, we are only too apt to \" throw away the baby with the bath-\nwater \" and blind ourselves also to the real matter in hand, which is the\ninvestigation of the unconscions manipulations brought about by the\nunruly because uncontrolled spirit (using this term in the sense not of a\nspirit, but of the spirit of man himself). As for the expression of surprise\nthat \" the bench was the only thing that cracked \", I may remark that it\nwas not, for the patient's complex cracked at the same time, that is to say\nthat the schizophrenic barrier was pierced, allowing the two sides of her\nnature to meet and form a healing union. It may be that one day an even\nbigger crack will occur in the one-sided consciousness of modern man that\nmay at last let in the light which will illumine the dark places of our minds\nand allow us to see the power of spirit over matter, and in this case of the\nhuman spirit over what are usually considered to be inanimate things. I\nheartily agree on the need for further investigation on these lines (indeed\nit was with the purpose of stimulating such research that the paper was\nwritten), but would point out that this must be accompanied by psycho-\nlogical knowledge and an eye not only on the aetiology but also on the\nteleology of the phenomena, that is to say on the purpose for wliich they are\nproduced.\nMr Carington in his letter admits the possibility of \" mind \" acting on\n\"\"\nmatter \" without the usual physiological mechanism, but does not like it\nto be \" assumed \" in such an \" extreme \" case as this. Here I of course\nagree, and should like to call attention to the second paragraph in my paper\nin which I emphasise that what I am putting forward is a hypothesis based\non this teleological view. Admittedly a large number of cases would have\nto be psychologically investigated to prove or disprove it. Nevertheless I\nwould point out that, even on the hypothesis advanced, it was not only the\nlady's experience which caused the bench to split, but rather that it was the\nrelationship between her and her physician which caused the happening to\noccur in his house, thus testifying to the joint nature of a healing process in\nwhich the physician is quite as much involved as the patient. Indeed, had\nhe himself not been slightly rattled by her continued absence from home,\nthat is to say, had his unconscious processes not also to some extent been\ninvolved, it would probably not have occurred. When psychic tension is\nset up there are invariably two factors producing a third, and the third\nfactor is always of a new and often unexpected order. But the unexpected\nis unexpected only by us, not by the to us unconscious but in themselves\npurposive factors that produce it. Thus, in this case, tie patient's own\npsychic experience, the concern of her physician and the splitting of the\nbench were all part of a single dramatic episode of which the purpose was\n-the heahng of a human soul, and I submit that only from this angle can it\nbe understood.\nJohn Layard\nSir,\u2014Dr Layard may safely be left to deal withthe criticisms of his paper ;\nI will confine myself in this letter to considering whether, as a member of\nihe Committee of Reference, I was right to recommend its publication. I\n:should like to begin by laying down the general principle that any indivi-\n\fSEPT.-OCT. 1944 Correspondence 83\ndual or committee making a selection of papers suitable for publication in\nour Proceedings should look primarily not for freedom from defects but for\nthe positive quality of making a useful contribution to thought on our\nsubject. Such a contribution may be a set of experimental results proved\nwith all the rigidity of statistical method or it may be a new suggestion\nwhich later workers can submit to experimental proof or disproof. Dr\nLayard's contribution seemed to me to be a very valuable one of the\nsecond kind. It makes the suggestion that poltergeist phenomena are\ntelekinetic expressions of an unconscious conflict in the mind of the agent.\nThat seems to me a valuable and original idea, which it would be stupid to\nsuppress because the paper gives no rigid scientific proof of its truth and\nbecause its author's m.ethods of thought seem to me to be obscure and\nunfamiliar. The opinion of a psychotherapist of Dr Layard's ability,\nexperience, and width of knowledge deserves consideration even if at\npresent we regard its truth as not proved. Others may prove or disprove it\nby experimental methods, and their work will be one of the fruits of Dr\nLayard's suggestions. Others too may state the theory in language more\nfamiliar to those of us who are better acquainted with the logic of science\nthan with that of analytical psychology, although surely we have some\nground for doubting whether the logic of science as at present understood\nis going to prove an adequate instrument of thought for dealing vv'ith the\nproblems of psychical research.\nMy own feeling is that we want more, not fewer papers of the quality of\nDr Layard's. The reason so few are published is that there are not many\npeople who can produce them.\nYours faithfully,\nRobert H. Thouless\nSir,\u2014In conversation with several members of the Society, I have heard\nexpressions of sharp disapproval of Dr Layard's contribution [Proc,\nPart 168, July 1944.) The critics appear to deny the evidential value of\nthe observations submitted by the author, and imply that by this test the\npaper should not have been published.\nTo me it seems that such criticism neglects the potential value of a\ngeneral theoretical approach to psychical research\u2014for so long limited to\nthe establishment of a museum of observations. Undoubtedly, Dr Layard\nhas provided an avenue for further thought. He suggests that seemingly\npointless phenomena may reflect states of conflict in the medium just as\nseemingly subjective experiences and actions may be interpreted as mani-\nfestations of non-conscious conflicts. In accordance with a psychological\ntheory he further suggests that these psychokinetic projections are not\nmere epiphenomena of the conflict, but are directed towards its solution ;\nand he regards them as symbolic just as other manifestations of conflict\nemploy a tortuous and often chaotic symbolism. In Dr Layard's article\nthis general view is presented against the background of a specific psycho-\nlogical theory, which however is not the only theory with which the inter-\npretation of the phenomena is compatible.\nIt is indeed to be appreciated that Dr Layard does not, in the final\nparagraph, suggest that only a Jungian should be chosen to interpret\n\f84 Journal of Society for Psychical Research sept.-oct. 1944\nPoltergeist phenomena etc., but that any competent psychologist,\nacquainted with symbolism, may find such study profitable.\nIt might have been preferable if the theory had been developed in the\nabstract, and without reference to specific instances of doubtful evidential\nvalue. Again, one might well quarrel with various single statements, e.g.\nthe astonishing reference on p. 239 to the autonomous nervous system in\nhuman subjects and its extension to the insects. But the many criticisms\nthat can be levelled in detail against Dr Layard's paper do not detract from\nits original and stimulating suggestions ; nor from its courageous attempt\nto link a particular set of psychological theories to psychical research. It is\nto be hoped that the Society will receive more contributions of this type,\nthough perhaps it might be advisable to make it clear that they were\npublished as a possible basis for discussion and research, rather than as\nresults of such research.\nYours faithfully,\nB. P. WiESNER\nREVIEWS\n\" Experiments on the Paranormal Cognition of Drawings. III. Steps in\nthe development of a repeatable technique,\" By W. Whately\nCarington. Proceedings of the American Society for Psychical\nResearch, Vol. XXIV, pp. 3-107 (Jan. 1944).\nThere is always a fascination about trying to beat chance, and in E.S.P.\nexperiments, unlike roulette, there is nothing to lose. The reveiwer has\nhad the advantage of direct contact with Mr Carington 's method in the\nroles of percipient and of cataloguer. He found that making drawings was\nmuch more amusing than guessing Zener cards or coloured counters, and\nin the cataloguing the few doubtful points encountered only added to the\ninterest of the work.\nMr Carington has devised a wonderfully simple tool for E.S.P. research,\nwhich is already beginning to shed a glimmer of light on the mechanism of\nparanormal cognition. With its \" catalogue \" and notes the paper forms\nan indispensable and comprehensive treatise. Every doubt or quibble that\nmight arise in the mind of experimenter or critic is exhaustively and con-\nvincingly dealt with, and there are valuable chapters on the technique of\ncataloguing and scoring hits. (An index would have been a welcome\nsupplement to the bare table of contents.)\nThere is one serious omission : a brief statement of the method in heavy\ntype at the head of the paper. As it is, the newcomer cannot easily get a\nbird's-eye view of the method, which is developed gradually over 100\npages. He is not much better off with Gardner Murphy's \" Statement of\nthe method for the non-mathematical reader \" which occupies a three page\nappendix full of mathematics. Hazelden, the cartoonist, once complained\nof the complexity of income tax forms and devised a simpler formula which\nbegan :\n\" It's like this ;\njust fill in your income for the year ...\" The\ngerm of Mr Carington 's catalogue idea can be stated in three paragraphs in\nsimple (if not basic) English.\n\fSEPT.-OCT. 1944 Reviews 85\nAn experimenter has a bag containing a large number of paper slips\nbearing the names of common objects. He picks out ten at random\u2014 Dog,\nTable, Spear, etc., and makes a drawing of each. In the next room twenty\npeople, the percipients, are trying to guess and draw the target-drawings\nthe experimenter is looking at. They make ten drawings each which are\ncollected after a given interval. Brown has drawn a Table, Smith a Spear.\nNobody else scores a hit.\nNow anybody asked to draw ten simple objects might include a table,\ni.e. Brown is quite likely to draw a table even if Table is not one\nof the target-drawings. Not so Spear, a less common object which will\nalso crop up by chance, but seldom. If a spear is drawn and Spear is\na target-drawing, one might say it was an odd coincidence. Given\nenough \" odd coincidences \" one soon reaches a statistically significant\nresult.\nBut how do we estimate the probability of spear or table being drawn by\nchance? We collect all percipients' drawings over a sufficient number of\nexperiments and enter them in a catalogue which thus shows the total\nnumber of each object drawn. It is now possible to find how many spears\nwere drawn on the day when Spear was a target-drawing, and how many\nwere drawn on days when it was not, i.e. when only chance can have been\noperating. If significantly more spears were drawn on the spear-target day\nthan the chance expectation given by the catalogue, then there is evidence\nof paranormal cognition. Similarly for Tables, but these being more\ncommon it will take a good many of them to \" beat \" the catalogue chance\nvalue.\nThat is the method. Its beauty lies in its simplicity and repeatability.\nInteresting experiments with drawings have been done for many years, but\nthere was no known method of evaluating them and there was nothing to\nrefute critics who said that all the results were due to chance.\nThe catalogue solves the problem, and Mr Carington should have\nemphasised more strongly than he has done that the compilation of a\n\" local \" catalogue is the very essence of the method. (Those who have a\nphobia of card-indexes can use an alphabetical ledger or loose-leaf book.)\nInstructions for the guidance of the experimenter are given on pp. 57-61.\nThese should be reprinted in our own Journal or Proceedings with a brief\nstatement of the method, or preferably made available as a leaflet and\nwidely circulated. Psychologists and others attracted by the method could\nthen obtain a copy of the paper under review and use it as a handbook,\nwhich is really what it is.\nThere is no space to discuss the positive results obtained (which go\nrather further than establishing de novo the existence of paranormal\ncognition) or the numerous safeguards against over-optimistic scoring.\nThe development of a repeatable technique free from the boredom of card-\nguessing is a great step forward and no experimenter should have any\ndifficulty in collecting a willing band of percipients.\nD.

Ehrenwald.\nThe British Journal of Medical Psychology, Vol. XX, Part i, 1944,\npp. 51-62.\nDr Ehrenwald here surveys the not very conclusive evidence for the\noccurrence of telepathy during analytical treatment, with the aim not of\ndemonstrating telepathy in this field, but of considering the extent to which\npsi-reactions between analyst and patient may need to be taken into\naccount in psycho-theraphy, now that on other evidential grounds tele-\npathy is coming into the region of accepted fact. He points out that the\nanalyst is unlikely to observe these reactions very often, if a frequent con-\ndition of their occurrence is, on his own part as well as the patient's, that\nthey should arise from subliminal motives. But he mentions a striking\ngeneral fact, which the present reviewer can confirm from observation :\nthe way in which patients rapidly respond to a given analyst with dreams\nthat accord with that analyst's doctrine of symbolism, producing dreams\nof typical Freudian structure for a Freudian, and full-blown mythological\nsymbolisms for a Jungian. This seems to occur before the patient can have\nany conscious grasp of the analyst's preferred system, of imagery.\nOn several grounds the situation between analyst and patient is seen to\nbe one that favours subliminal action in both minds, and a case emerges for\nthe view that a good deal of subliminal interaction may also take place.\nThis view gives something more definite for discussion than the contested\npoint whether \" intuition \", a vague term in this context, has a real part to\nplay in the therapeutic procedure.\nDr Ehrenwald 's article is a further indication that psychical research\nhas light to throw upon some of the obscurities in psvchological medicine,\nK.

Tyrrell ;\nsubject, \" Telepathy and Precognition : What do\nthey signify ?\n\"\nCASE : AN APPARENTLY PRECOGNITIVE INCIDENT\nIN A DREAM-SEQUENCE\nThis case has been reported to us by Professor C. D. Broad, to v\/hom the\ndreamer, here called \" Y \", sent the following written recollection of\ndreams experienced a week earlier. It will be seen that Y had also related\nhis dreams to Professor Broad on the morning after their occurrence.\n\" Oct. gth, 1944.\n\" Sometime during the night of October ist-2nd 1944 (probably towards\nmorning), I had the following dream while staying with Professor C. D.\nBroad at Trinity College. As the dream was rather unpleasant and\nextremely vivid it stayed in my mind, and I related what I could remember\nof it to Professor Broad at breakfast on the following morning (October\n2nd). I of course related the dream of my own accord and was not\nprompted by Professor Broad. The following account is not so full and\nprobably not so accurate as that which I gave to Professor Broad on\nOctober 2nd, as I have not thought much about the incident since.\n\" There were three more or less distinct incidents in the dream, all\nconnected with trains. I can now remember only two of the incidents,\nthough I am fairly certain that there was another and that I related it to\nProfessor Broad on the morning after the dream. I am also now not\ncertain of the order in which the incidents occurred.\n\fNOV.-DEC. 1944 Case: Precognitive Incident 89\n\" Incident i. I was about to leave a large terminus station in a rather\ncrowded train. The train started when I was still standing on the plat-\nform. I was unable to open the compartment door so I jumped onto the\nfootboard outside the door. I was still unable to get the door open and I\nwas carried away still clinging on outside. There were people inside the\ncompartment. I cannot remember whether they tried to help me with\nthe door but they were sympathetic. I was not particularly frightened\nuntil one of the people inside the compartment told me that another train\nwas coming in the opposite direction along the adjoining line. He (or she\n\u2014I cannot remember which) told me to squeeze myself up against the\noutside of the compartment door as I should quite probably be knocked\noff by this second train. I cannot remember what happened then but I do\nnot think that I was knocked off.\n\" Incident 2. I think that this incident came after incident i, but I am\nnot absolutely certain. Anyhow, I was standing on a platform of the same\nstation. As I have said, it was a terminus station, and, as on many London\nstations, taxis drove right into the station itself. This time I was standing\nmuch further back in station than in incident i. (Nearer to the taxis and\nticket office.) A train was standing at a platform (I think at the platform\nfrom which I had started in incident i). The whole station sloped gently\nupwards from the ticket-office end in the direction in which the trains\nnormally left the station. Suddenly the train, which was standing some\nway up the platform, began to move slowly backwards (downhill) towards\nthe ticket office. I knew that the brakes had given way. The train moved\nquite slowly but I knew that it would crush the taxis. I am not quite cer-\ntain where exactly the taxis were, but I think that they had driven a short\nway up the platform. Anyway there was a great panic and the taxis all\ntried to get away. (For some reason they could not leave in the normal\nmanner.) I can remember one taxi down on the line, between the plat-\nforms and bumping over the rails between the train and the buffers at the\nend of the platform. The train, however, which was still moving very\nslowly along the lines, turned towards the taxi which had almost gained\nthe further platform\u2014I think the train turned off along points to do this,\nI cannot remember what happened then, but I was perfectly certain that\nthe train would crush the taxis and I was extremely frightened.\n\" I related a sequel to the dream in a letter to Professor Broad. But I\nshould say here that the station (Ely) was not in the least like the station in\nmy dream. Moreover the carriage was open and had no compartments,\nwhile in my dream I distinctly remember that there were compartments.\"\nThe dreams were on the night of Sunday-Monday, 1-2 Nov., 1944.\nIn a letter dated \" Tuesday \" and marked by Professor Broad as received\nby him on 4 Nov., 1944, Y related the \" sequel \" as follows:\n\" Do you remember the account I gave you'of the very curious dream\nthat I had on Sunday night? There was a rather remarkable, though not\nexact, repetition of it in real life yesterday. When my train got to Ely an\nAmerican officer in the carriage got out to go to the bookstall, leaving the\ncompartment door open. The whistle blew, the train started and a porter\nslammed the door shut. 1 shouted to the officer and tried to get the door\nopen but it had jammed. He ran like a hare and jumped onto the running\nboard. We both struggled to open the compartment door\u2014he clinging on\n\fJournal of Society for Psychical Research nov.-dec. 1944\noutside amid shouts and screams from the station officials. It was not\nuntil the train was clear of the station and going at some speed that we\nmanaged to open the door and he could climb in.\nOf course in my dream it was I personally who was clinging on outside.\nI am glad to say that none of the other incidents of my dream recurred!\"\nHaving obtained from Y the written account of his dream which is\nprinted above, Professor Broad wrote to him as follows :\n\" October 13th, 1944\n\" My dear Y,\n\" Many thanks for your letter of October 9th, containing an account of\nyour dream as you remember it.\n\" Incident i agrees entirely with my recollection of what you told me\nat breakfast, except that I am_ sure that there were rather more details in\nyour original narrative. I am pretty sure that your wife was in the carriage\nin the dream, and that when she showed some anxiety about your not\ngetting in you took a rather haughty attitude as if clinging to the footboards\nof running trains were child's-play to you.\n\" Oddly enough I have no recollection whatever of your narrating\nIncident 2, the story of the train running backwards down the slope into\nthe terminus and endangering the taxis in the station. If you did relate it\nto me, I have completely forgotten about it, and that seems unlikely.\n\" On the other hand you certainly did narrate an Incident 3, which you\nseem to have forgotten or to have thought irrelevant for the present pur-\npose. So far as I remember it was roughly as follows. You found yourself\nin company of a number of what you took to be members of the left-wing\nintelligentsia. One of them said to you '\nIt is no use going on any longer ',\nor words to that effect, and they made it plain to you that they and all\nthose whom they regarded as '\nthe best people '\nwere intending to commit\nsuicide at once. They were going to do this by all getting into a kind of\nlarge box, which they showed you. In it they would perish, either by\nsuffocation or by some poisonous vapour as in a lethal chamber for des-\ntroying cats or dogs. They pressed ycu to join them. You disliked the idea\nvery much, but felt that you would have to do so in order to be '\nin the\nmovement '.\nI can't remember whether you actually got into the box or\nnot. But either you woke before doing so or immediately afterwards. Do\nyou remember any of this now? It has no bearing on the incident at Ely\nstation, but I think it ought to be reported as part of the dream which was\nnot verified.\n\" Yours ever,\n\" (Signed) C. D. Broad.\"\nIn his reply to a letter enquiring whether he often had dreams about\nrailway travelling, Y wrote to the Editor :\n\" I do not think that railway travelling is a very frequent feature of my\ndreams. However, I think that I should reiterate what I said to Dr Broad\n\u2014that the train in my dream and the train in which I actually travelled\nwhen the incident occurred bore very little resemblance to each other, and\nthat the station from which I left in my dream bore little or no resemblance\nto Ely station.\"\n\fNov.-DEC. 1944 Card-Guessing Experiments 91\nTHE SENSITIVITY OF CARD-GUESSING EXPERIMENTS\nBy A. J. C. Wilson\nOn comparing the recent experiments of Soal and Goldney^ with the clas-\nsical experiments of the Committee on Thought-Reading,'^ one is imme-\ndiately struck with the greater difficulty of demonstrating the card-guessing\nfaculty. The Committee's results would appear convincing to anyone\nsatisfied of the honesty of the experimenters and subjects, whereas the\nmore recent experiments require an elaborate mathematical technique to\nshow the existence of any non-chance phenomena. The Creeiy family\nmay have been more gifted card-guessers than is Mr B. S., but it would\nseem that there is a real advantage in using a large number of difterent \u2022\ncards (say twenty or fifty) rather than the five of the Zener or modified\nZener packs.\nThe advantage arises thus. Mr B. S. seems to get approximately one\ncard in ten right through some factor other than chance. He gets two in\nten right by chance. The non-chance effect is therefore superposed on a\nchance effect of double its magnitude, and considerable analysis is needed\nto demonstrate its existence. Suppose however that there were fifty\ndifferent cards, and he still got one in ten right through the non-chance\nfactor. The non-chance factor would then be the main cause of getting\ncards right, with only a small chance disturbance, in magnitude about\none-fifth of the non-chance eifect.\nIt is perhaps desirable to put this argument in mathematical form. It\nis essentially the same as that in Appendix A (page 130) of Soal and Gold-\nney's paper, but with an additional variable : the number of different cards.\nIf the number of different cards is M, the probabihty (C) of getting a card\nright by chance is i\/M. If the probability of getting it right though the\nnon-chance effect is P = i\/G (i.e. if the chance of getting a card right\nthrough the non-chance effect is one in G guesses), the number of correct\nguesses to be expected in N trials is\nNP + (N-NP)C = N[P4-(i -P)C] (i)\nThe value to be expected for the observed probability of a correct guess is\ntherefore\np = P + (i -P)C = (M + G-i)\/MG, (2)\nand, if the distribution is binomial, the standard error in p will be\n\u2022^P(i-P)\/N (3)\nIn normal scientific work p would be considered significantly different\nfrom C if p - C exceeded three times the standard error of p. (The odds\nagainst this happening by chance alone would be about 350 to i.) The\nprobable number of trials (N) required to reach this level of significance\nis given by\np-C>3Vp(i-p)\/N\n^ Soal and Goldney, Proc, Soc. Psych. Res., XLVII, 21, 1943.\n-Barrett, Guiney andMyers, Proc. Soc. Psych. Res., I, 13, 1882, and later reports.\n\f92 Journal of Society for Psychical Research nov.-dec. 1944\nor N>9p(i-p)\/(p-C)2 (4)\n= 9(M-i-G-i)(G-i)\/(M-i).\nFor any fixed value of G, this decreases rapidly with increase of M, and\ntherefore the number of trials required to test, say, the effect of drugs or\nfatigue would be reduced by using a larger pack. This may be an im-\nportant consideration, as, for a given percipient, the ability to make correct\nguesses seems to decrease with time (see, for example, references ^' ^).\nSome numerical values of N as a function of M and G are given in the\naccompanying table.\nThe above argument rests on the assumption that the fraction of non-\nchance correct guesses is independent of the number of different cards.\nThis is perhaps untrue, but it would be strange if G depended on M in\nsuch a way to keep N constant. (Thouless ^ has noted some increase of G\nwith M, but it may be due only to the above mentioned decrease of ability\nwith time.) It would seem well worth while to make experiments to test\nthe theoretical increase of sensitivity with the number of different cards ;\nan increase in sensitivity would in any case be welcome, and failure to find\nan increase might throw some light on the mechanism by which the non-\nchance correct guesses occur.\nThe following table gives N, the approximate number of trials required\nto establish the existence (with odds about 350 to i) of non-chance correct\nguesses for varying numbers of different cards (M) and ability (i in G)\nto make non-chance correct guesses.\nM G = 3 10 30 100 300 1,000\n3 45 500 4,200 45,000 410,000 4,500,000\n5 32 280 2,200 23,000 200,000 2,200,000\n10 24 170 1,100 1 1,000 92,000 1,000,000\n30 .\n20 1 10 530 4,000 30,000 320,000\n100 19 90 340 1,800 11,000 99,000\n300 18 84 290 1,200 5,400 39,000\n1,000 18 82 270 1,000 3>Soo 18,000\n00 18 81 260 900 2,700 9,000\nCORRESPONDENCE\nSiR,^\u2014Mr Donald West has performed a useful service in demolishing\nanother bogus \" criticism \" of the card-guessing experiments. As far\nback as 1939 I remarked to Mr Harry Price that Mr Mulholland's \" per-\ncentages\"\u2014so impressive to the uninstructed layman\u2014meant just nothing\nat all to anyone who had the slightest acquaintance with statistical method.\n1 Thouless, Brit. J. Psych. (General Section), XXXIII, 15, 1942.\n^ Carington and Heywood, Proc. Soc. Psych. Res., XLVII, 229, 1944, especially\n\u00a7 5, 6.\n\" Thouless, Proc. Soc. Psych. Res., XLVII, i, 1942, especially p. 12.\n\fNOV.-DEC. 1944 Correspotidence 93\nI have checked a good many of Mr West's figures and fully agree with\nhim that, on the scanty data available, there is no reason to suppose that\nthe results of this matching experiment violated the mathematics of proba-\nbility in any way. It is unfortunate that while the educated public will\nhave access to Mr Mulholland's garbled and misleading percentages, few\nof them will see Mr West's excellent reply.\nAs it is, the ignorance of the reading public with regard to the present\nposition of modern experimental work in Extra-Sensory Perception is\nappalling. Only last March a writer in the magazine World Review\nstated that it had been found impossible to confirm Dr Rhine's experi-\nments in this country. This commentator on scientific topics apparently\nknew nothing of the work of Tyrrell or of Mrs Goldney and myself.\nIn the new edition of his A.B.C. of Psychology, C. K. Ogden still\nrepeats the out-of-date comment that \"the statistics (of card- guessing)\nare complicated and the matter is still sub jiidice.\" Far from being\n\" complicated \" the statistics are so simple and so well estabhshed that\nalmost any schoolboy ought to be able to use them correctly.\nWhat is the remedy for all this ? Surely it is that psychical researchers\nof standing must not be content to write only technical articles for the\nProceedings and Journal. They must lecture, write books and reviews\nthat will appeal to the general public and take every opportunity of\ndealing drastically hut in simple language v;ith such people as Mr Mul-\nholland. Sir Leonard Hill and other materialists who rashly tilt at Psychical\nResearch with arguments that will not bear a moment's serious exam-\nination.\nYours etc.,\n\u2022\nS. G. SOAL\nSir,\u2014I. Even accepting Dr Layard's corrected chronology, I still fail\nto see any kind of warrant for the supposition that there v\/as a causal\nconnection between an event in the patient's mind and the splitting of the\nbench. If it were an established fact that the release of psychical tensions\nin patients' minds was always or often approximately synchronous v\/ith\nthe occurrence of overt mechanical effects, otherwise inexplicable, at a\ndistance, then it would be reasonable to suggest that this was an instance\nin point ; or if there were a comprehensible mechanism whereby such\nreleases could be shown likely to produce such effects, the same would\napply. But to postulate a causal connection merely because something\nrather odd and unexpected happened at approximately the same time as a\n\" release \" (which, incidentally, v\/as not objectively observed) seems to me\nin the highest degree implausible, and to provide no occasion for theoreti-\ncal enquiry.\n2. I cannot help feeling that, with all respect, Dr Thouless and Dr\nWiesner miss the important point. If it were established that benches\nsplit, or other mechanical events occur, in so frequent close synchrony with\nidentifiable psychical events at a distance as to make the deduction of a\ncausal connection virtually inevitable, then Dr Layard's suggestion would\nbe timely and plausible\u2014indeed, there would seem to be but few possible\nalternatives. But this is very far from being the case, and it seems to me\nextremely poor policy to cross probably non-existent bridges in public\n\f94 Journal of Society for Psychical Research nov.-dec. 1944\nbefore we come to them. It is uphill work enough, Heaven knows, trying\nto persuade the scientific world to take seriously even such well-established\nphenomena as Telepathy and Apparitions\u2014let alone Precognition, or\n\" PK \" which seems to be knocking vigorously at the door. But when it\ncomes to accounting for the splitting of benches by distant psychical\nreleases, they might be excused for grading us with those who deduce the\nexistence of a Cosmic Cow from the fact that the Moon is made of green\ncheese.\nYours, etc.,\nW?IATELY CaRINGTON\nSir,\u2014Owing to extreme pressure of work and also for other reasons I\nhad hoped to avoid being drawn into this discussion, but the remarkable\nletters of Drs Thouless and Wiesner printed in the Sept.-Oct. Journal\ncompel me to enter the fray.\nIn scientific work it is usual, I think, for workers who enter into public\ndiscussion to have a fair practical acquaintance with the material with\nwhich they deal. Dr Layard says that he has only \" fleetingly encoun-\ntered \" poltergeists, a statement which we can either accept or reject.\nWhat is clear, however, is that he does not seem to have any idea what\npsychical researchers mean when they speak of poltergeists and, moreover,\nlittle idea what he means by them. Turn to p. 239. We are told there\nthat psi (by which I suppose he means whatever E)r Thouless means by\nthat word) \" uses \" actual objects and that these objects are poltergeists. I\ndo not know what this means even if it means anything at all. Take two\nof the most famous examples of poltergeist phenomena in history, those\nwhich were said to occur for some thirty years with the Cure of Ars and\nthose which convulsed Stans, near Lucerne in 1861. Did the psi of the\ngentle Cure and of the servant in Stans \" use \" objects and were the objects\nnoisy spirits or the pictures covered with excrement in the first case or the\nmoving massive walnut table in the second ? Later in his paper Dr Layard\nadds to the confusion by calling them effects\u2014but I v\/ill not insist further.\nWith regard to the main part of the paper I would again suggest that it is\nusual in scientific work to give references where convenient for important\nauthorities quoted. Now it appears that Meier's paper was read and later\nprinted in some form, although the source is not given. In 1938 Meier\ngave an account of the case in Copenhagen which, it seems, excited some\ninterest and I suspect a little amusement in German psychological circles.\nMoreover in the Zentralblatt f. Psychotherapie (1939, XI, 284-303), a\npaper by Meier appeared under the title of Spontanmanifestationen des\nkoUectiven Unbewiissteti which may be the one referred to by Dr Layard.\nThis is not the place to discuss the case or indeed to inquire too closely\nhow Meier was able to give \" a long and exact description \"\n(p. 244) of\nwhat happened to his absent patient during sixteen and a half hours when,\namong other exploits, she had to cling to a parked car to avoid a possible\nlevitation. I will pass to the main point at issue.\nAs far as I can understand Dr Layard's theory, which seems to me so\nhopelessly muddled as to be almost unintelligible, it is that poltergeist\nphenomena are, as Dr Thouless puts it, telekinetic expressions of an un-\nconscious conflict in the mind of the agent. This, Dr Thouless thinks, is\n\fNOV.-DEC. 1944 Correspondence 95\na \" valuable and original idea \" {Journal, p. 83), an opinion echoed by Dr\nWiesner on p. 84. I confess I find it vei^y gratifying that some people are\nbeginning to find these ideas \" stimulating \"\n(p. 84), even though they\nseem to think they are original. The truth is, however, that they are\ncommonplace. For over fifteen years at the minimum they have been\ndiscussed verbally by the very few serious and experienced students of the\nphysical phenomena. The reason that they have not been developed in\nprint is because of the doubt which surrounds all the physical phenomena\nand the extraordinary view which has so long been held by the leaders of\nthe S.P.R. that what only is of interest in these phenomena is whether\nthey are \" genuine \" or not.\nNow anyone who knows anything about what Mrs Robert Browning\ncalled \" the mystery of iniquity \" concerning D. D. Home or the whis-\npered tales of Vianney, Palladino, Eva C. and the rest knows that the\nphysical phenomena, whether genuine or fraudulent, are closely connected\nwith unconscious human conflict ; and it is precisely this which makes\ntheir study so fascinating and so important. But what we require are not\nconfused and highly dubious stories put out by psychotherapists who\ndeclare, like Dr Layard, that at least half {sic) the phenomena dealt with\nby Jungian psychologists may be reckoned as coming within the category\nof psi but reasoned discussion based upon properly checked experimental\ndata and conducted by those who have both the historical and practical\nknowledge. I think therefore that our Proceedings is not the place to print\narticles by persons, who, however distinguished in their own fields, do not\neven know how to employ the correct nomenclature in ours.\nV '\n. Yours etc.,\n- .\n_\nE.J.Dingwall\nSir, \u2014I shall be obliged if you will allow me, as a member of the Council\nof the S.P.R. for over forty years, to support Mrs Goldney and Mr Car-\nington in protesting against the low standards of evidence which are now\naccepted by the Proceedings and Journal.\nIt is impossible under space Hmitations to go into detailed criticism, but\nI will take three recent examples of the tendency to which I refer.\n(1) . In the Journal of Nov.-Dec. six pages are taken up by the story of\na \" haunted house \". I wonder what Myers, Podmore or Mrs Sidgwick\nwould have said about the quality of the evidence in this case 1 Detailed\nquotation is impossible ; let anyone accustomed to our scientific standards\nof evidential value read the narrative and judge for himself. Suffice it to\nnote that the temporary derangement of a wireless set, a passing noise\noutside on a window pane, a bad smell in the bathroom, noticed \" collec-\ntively \" and \" suggesting death and decay \", the broken wrist of a lady\nwho slipped on the floor, slight damage, during the family's absence, to a\ngarden wall (obviously due to a motor vehicle)\u2014incidents hke these,\nordinary happenings in everyday fife\u2014are seriously discussed as either\npossibly or certainly \" super-normal \". The evidence of this \" haunted\nhouse \" case falls far below even the standards of Borley Rectory ; further\ncomment is needless.\n(2). In the current issue of the Journal we are presented with an experi-\nence twelve years after the date of its occurrence. It comes from a lady\n\f96 Joiunal of Society for Psychical Research nov.-dec. 1944\nwho \" often seems to know things that are going to happen \", and is\ni-emembered by a maid who is \" genuinely psychic \".\nThe momentary vision (\" one second \") of a sick friend appears \" in\na special space of its own \" ; a vision \" not so strong \" some weeks later\nof the same friend after his death \" appears in physical space \". As to the\nalleged \" striking similarity \" between this nebulous narrative and those\ncollected by the Society \" in former times \", I can assure the writer that\nin those days the Society would never have printed a case of such feeble\nquality, or the editorial comment which accompanies it.\n(3). Mrs Goldney and Mr Carington have already called attention to\nvarious details in Dr Layard's fantastic paper. I will therefore confine\nmyself to stressing the point that practically the whole of the main eviden-\ntial story depends on the unsupported second-hand testimony of a single\nwitness\u2014and what a witness ! The lady in question interviews her doctor\nwho remarks that a \" good psychiatrist \" would have consigned her forth-\nwith to a lunatic asylum. He nevertheless lets her leave and she wanders\nabout Zurich for sixteen and a half hours. She makes for the concert hall,\nwhich, because of its central position, is \" symboHc of her complex \", but\nis deterred from entering because a concert notice is printed in violet and\n\" violet means death to her The juxtaposition of some lamps brings\nher great relief, but this was only temporary, for on her homeward journey\nshe has to clutch at motor cars and even holly bushes to avoid levitation.\nShe then finds that on the covers of street drains \" no evil can reach her\n\"\nso she rushes from drain td drain \" swift as the wind, for she still\nhad to follow her nose \", and finally reaches the doctor, who gives her the\nstartling news that at or about the time of her temporary improvement\noutside the concert hall the seat of an old chair in his consulting room had\nsuddenly split\u2014the causal connection between these two incidents seems\nto Dr Layard quite obvious and convincing. The lady had walked for\ni6| hours \" without a break \", and apparently without food. This means\nthat she had covered some 33 miles under conditions too severe for the\nbest trained troops. On the unsupported testimony of this deranged wit-\nness this farrago of absurdities has been olTered to an audience of S.P.R.\nmembers. How it was ever accepted by the Committee of Reference\npasses my comprehension.\nYours truly,\nE. N. Bennett\n[The Journal prints the best cases that it can get, but under the stress of\npresent conditions the material brought to our notice gives small choice\nand the best may seem of thinner quality than in the past. If so, we have\nno desire to shift the weight of Sir Ernest Bennett's disapproval to those\nmembers who take the trouble to investigate and present such cases as\ncan be gathered in these preoccupied times.\n\u2014\nEd.]\n\f^\nJOURNAL OF THE\nSOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH\nfor Private Circulation amongst Members and Associates only\nJan -Feb., 1945 Vol. XXXIII\u2014No. 610-61\n1\nCONTENTS\nPAGE\nNew Members - - - - - \"\n,\n\"\nMeeting of the Council ______\nDonations to the Funds of the Society - _ _ -\nObituary - -__-.___\nAnnual Report of the Council for 1944 _ _ - -\nSome Recent Investigations into the Borley Rectory Case\nCorrespondence - -_-_-__ 1 10\n98\n98\n98\n99\n99\nNOTICE OF MEETING\nTHE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF\nTHE SOCIETY\nwill be held in\nThe Society's Library,\n-\n31 Tavistock Square, London, W.C. i\nSaturday, 24 February 1945, at 2.1,0 p.m.\nTo transact the business set out on the formal notice dated\n20 January 1945, and already circulated.\nDR R.

Abdy Collins on \" The Goligher Circle \".\n15 March 1945.\u2014Mr Kenneth Richmond on \" Conditions Favourable\nto Psychical Phenomena : Do Methods of Research Tend to Destroy\nthem?\" . ,\n-\nANNUAL REPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR 1944\nWar conditions in 1944 have not been such as to make the conduct of the\nSociety's business any easier. It is clear, hov\/ever, both from the good\nattendance at the Discussion Meetings and by the applications of intending\nMembers and Student -Associates that interest in the Society's work in and\noutside the Society has not suffered. The Council particularly welcome\nthe increase in the number of new Student-Associates vv^ho will, it is hoped,\nin due timie become full Members and provide a new generation of active\nworkers.\nWith the liberation of a great part of the Continent of Europe the Council\nhope that it v\/ill be possible in the near future to resume co-operative work\nwith the Continental researchers, particularly with those who have been\nassociated with the Society in the past.\nThe Society has received an appeal from the Inter-Allied Book Centre\nto provide Parts of its own Proceedings and other standard literature on\nPsychical Research to help in restocking University libraries in this and\nother countries which have been destroyed or damaged by the war. The\nCouncil consider this appeal desei\"ving of the fullest support, and proposes\nto present a large selection of Parts of S.P.R. Proceedings. They would\nappeal to individual members to send to the Society's rooms any Parts of\nProceedings or any books on psychical research they can spare. Literature\nso sent will be sorted out ;\npublications adapted to academic needs will be\nsent to the Inter-Allied Book Centre : other books and periodicals can be\nsent to H.M. Forces.\n\flOO Journal of Society for Psychical Research JAN.-FEB. 1945\nAs the need for replenishing libraries will continue for, perhaps, twenty\nyears, the Council would urge members to direct in their wills that all\nParts of S.P.R. Proceedings should be sent to the Society to be disposed of\nas the Council may determine.\nThe organisation of the Society. In February Mr Richmond was\nappointed part-time residential Secretary for three years as from i January\n1944, and thereaftervuntil such time as a permanent Secretary or Research\nOfficer be appointed. He was to be in attendance at the office as should be\nnecessary on five days a week and available for interviews by appointment\nat times not within office hours. In present conditions there are many\nenquirers and applicants for advice who are unable to call at the rooms\nexcept in the evening and at week ends.\nInstead of a joint House and Finance Committee a separate House\nCommittee and a separate Finance Committee were appointed, the former\nconsisting of Miss Newton, the Hon. Secretary and the Hon. Treasurer,\nand the latter of Mrs Goldney, Mr Lambert, Mr Redmayne and the Hon.\nTreasurer. In November Mr Redmayne's health compelled him to resign\nhis membership of this Committee. The Council wish to take this oppor-\ntunity of thanking him for the invaluable and important services he has\nrendered to the Society, especially in connexion with finance, ever since he\nbecame a member of the Council.\nA List of the Officers of the Society and of the Members of Committees\nappointed in 194^}. will be found in xht Journal for April 1944. The Council\npropose for the future to place on a table in the library a book with a\nlist, kept up to date, of Officers and Members of Committees.\nMiss Newton, who had been co-opted a member of Council early in the\nwar, and to whom jointly with the Hon. Secretary very wide powers were\nat the same tim.e delegated by the Council, expressed a wish that her co-\noptation for 1944 should not be renewed. The Council received informa-\ntion of her wishes with the very greatest regret in view of the length and\ndistinction of her services ever since she became an officer of the Society.\nThey wish to place on record their warmest appreciation of the self-\ndenying readiness with which she consented to come out of her well-\nearned retirement at the beginning of the war and to bear a very large\nshare of the burden of carrying on the Society's work. She has very\nkindly consented to remain a member of the Flouse Committee.\nThe Council regret to announce the resignation from their number of\nSir Lawrence Jones, a very old member of Council and former President\nof the Society, and also of Prof. Macneile Dixon, neither of whom find it\npossible to continue in present conditions to take an active part in the\nCouncil's work. The Council wish to tender their warmest thanks to both\nof them for valuable service to the Society. In the place of Sir Lawrence\nJones, who was an elected member, they have appointed Mr Tyrrell.\nResearch : Mr Richmond reports as follows :\n[a) Interest in the work and aims of the Society has been evinced in a\nwide variety of calls and enquiries. Among callers we have had members\nof the United States, Netherlands and Czechoslovakian Forces, some of\nhigh rank, enquiring about the doings of the Society and in some cases\nrecounting experiences and experiments of their own which they wished to\ndiscuss in the light of S.P.R. experience. An interesting visitor was a\n\fJAN.-FEB. 1945 Amiual Report of the Councilfof ig^^ lOI\nChinese Professor on his way to residence for reseaixh at Trinity College,\nCambridge, introduced to us by the China Section of the British Council.\nA number of enquirers have called for help and advice over problems of\nautomatism, \" psychic development \" and ostensible spirit messages :\nsome of these people were on unsafe ground and needed psychological\nhelp. Others are being encouraged to experiment and record their results.\nA desirable tendency is developing in newspaper offices to consult the\nS.P.R. by telephone (at any hour) as to the attitude to be taken towards\nnews stories on psychical subjects.\nThe V\/orking Group has been under the difficulty that several of its most\ninterested members have had their place of employment changed and\ncan seldom attend : it is chiefly due to the steady interest of Mrs Goldney\nand Mr Denys Parsons that the work of the Group has been kept going.\nMr Parsons reports as Secretary of the Group :\n\" Thirty-five meetings were held during the year. A preliminary inves-\ntigation was made of two clairvoyants, but the results were not encouraging.\nThe chief work of the Group has been an intensive investigation of the\nclaims of L. E. Eeman, a practitioner, of 24 Baker St., W. i. Mr Eeman\nclaims, riiter alia, that if a person in a relaxed state is connected by wires to\na small tube containing a drug, he or she will experience the symptoms\nwhich would be produced by the drug if administered in the normal way.\nWe have tested four subjects and, although pronounced reactions are\nalways obtained, we have not so far found any correlation between the\nreactions and the particular drug in circuit. The investigation is pro-\nceeding. The next problem to be tackled by the Group will be a reinves-\ntigation of Kiiner's claims that the human aura is rendered visible to\nmany people by means of a dicyanin screen, and the co-operation will be\nwelcomed of any members or their friends who have had the experience of\nseeing auras, by this means or otherwise.\"\nMention should be made of two pieces of apparatus constructed by\nMr Parsons, one a device of his own by which pure clairvoyance of the\ncolours of uns^een counters can be tested (the results appear to be negative\nwhen clairvoyance is isolated from any possible telepathy), and the other\na version of the electrically-driven machine devised for experiments in\npsycho-kinesis\" at Duke University.\nThanks are due to Mr Carington for his labours in assessing the\nvoluminous |results of experiments in precognition, and to Mr Parsons\nand Mr Burman for preparing a catalogue of the data obtained. The cal-\nculations are not quite completed, but the attempt with 95 percipients to\nobtain precognition of drawings appear to show results just short of being\nsignificantly below chance expectation as assessed by Whately Carington's\nCatalogue method. If significant results below chance expectation were\nobtained this would be of interest as confirming the suggestion that the\nhuman mind normally resists the manifestation of precognition, but the\nexperiments under review do not at present provide evidence that this is\nthe case.\nInvestigation of the relief of pain efl^ected by Mr Frederick Knowles's\nmethod of mental concentration upon the sufl^erer has been brought\nto a conclusion, and it is hoped that a report on this will shortly be\npublished.\n\f-+ J-i ooco\nrfj o c\nI\u20141 1\u2014\n(\nCO ^\n-+\nC^\n1(2'-': S\ns \u2014 g S\nsis\n^r- <i> r- ^\nP s Hi\n-+ CC: C^l C. 1-1 O O iC CO rH '^D\ncc 'X c: \u2014I X' -+ ic ir:. -i' t-h x\nCoC^Oi-HOOOOi-iC'-*\nit: 00 CM 1-H 1-i\no o c\nrH I\u2014\nI\nWC] -JH CO\n(M\nCO O OO rH rH\n'M -+ c: o -H t-\nI\u2014( t-H\nCO c: o o O CO X rH C'\nlO >-i O i-t\nCO 'M rH\n--r> . 1 --^^\n^ \"\n\u2014\nO hH\n^53\n\u00a72\nS \u00abJ\n^Lj'\nO <7i CO\nT-H\nCO CX)\nh GO CO\nCM\n0\n00 0\n960\/7 \u00a3144\nOS\ns ^ o\n-53\na\n'^5\n71\nra\n5^\nCO o o o o\nO C^l O I-'\niqOOX CM --^CO -i-\nryjOirrj 1-1 CM C\nL': w\n00 c: CO CM -t\n0\nO C: O' T-H r\n1 I '^g-^\n3J \"to\n03\n=5 c^j O I\n&5\no\nH\n6 . . ^\nII\n^ G-'\nf S g^f^\ntMcM\n^ rH\nCO\n0\ntH\nr-l\nrH\ntJH iH\nrH\nCO\n\\n\nCO iM\n(M\nCO\nSOfl\n\fo\nO 00\nI\u2014\ni\noo CO\nCI\n=4>\nft;\nto e\nwe\n2 e\nS o o\n2 o o\ncoo\nS C S\ne\nciO OO\nXI o t-^ o\nOOO i-H O\n(Mia CO ^\nOO\nGOO\nGOO\nlO I>\n<a O O\no o\ngoo\nO\n^ r-\nloo\nfa\n=) S g \u00bb\no s s S\no\n5; ^ C>\nP\nO\nft\no\n!55\nO\"-!

A paper describing the theoretical conclusions to which he has\nbeen led was published in Proceedings, Part 168.\nAttention is being mainly devoted at present to the differences between\nindividual percipients, between sexes and between originals, and to the\ninteractions of these factors with each, other\n\u2014\ne.g. such questions as\nwhether women are superior or inferior to men, whether some percipients\nare really more successful than others, or whether the superiority of one\nsex over the other (if any) is independent of the nature of the original. It\nis hoped that a full report will be available shortly.\n{b) The recent publication in the United States of America of articles on\npsycho-kinesis, mentioned in the last Annual Report, has caused many of\nour members to conduct experiments in this matter so far as their limited\nleisure permitted. The Council hope that circumstances will soon make\npossible the undertaking of experiments on a larger scale.\n(c) Several cases of interest have been reported to the Officers of the\nSociety or to individual members and have been followed up as far as\npracticable in war conditions.\nAt a Council Meeting held on 26th May, 1943, it was suggested that\nthere should be a repetition of the Census of Hallucinations. So\nambitious a project was considered unlikely to succeed in war time, and\nanother was proposed, not so much to test the frequency and distribution\nof apparitional experiences, as to get in some more cases.\nThis was to use the principle of the \" round-robin \" in order to pass\nthe original Census question to a number of people without involving\na lot of clerical work. Starting with a number of circular letters, bear-\ning the Census Question and certain instructions, these were sent to\nselected individuals who were asked to divide the packet into two and\nsend each half to a friend, who was asked to divide again and send on, and\nso on. Anyone having had such an experience as the Census Question\nreferred to was asked to coro.municate with the S.P.R. for further quest-\nioning.\nSix packets of circular letters were sent off from six centres simultane-\nously on or about the 3rd July, 1943. Only two poor cases were the result,\nand it is to be presumed that many people did not send on the packets of\nletters they received.\nThe Discussion Meetings referred to in the last Annual Report have\nbeen successfully continued this year. The general interest aroused by\nthem has resulted in the meetings being thrown open to all members of the\nSociety and to their being announced beforehand in the Journal whenever\npracticable. In fact they differ very little from the Private meetings of the\nSociety except that the papers are shorter and less formal, and a longer\ntime is allowed for subsequent discussion, which is usually lively and well\nmaintained. They give the ordinary member an opportunity, which he\napparently appreciates, of putting forward his individual point of view\nwithout undue formality. A Hst of these meetings is printed at the end of\nthis Report.\n\fio6 Journal of Society for Psychical Research jan.-feb. 1945\nThe finances of the Society are in a sound condition, and it has not been\nfound necessary during 1944 to ask the trustees of the Research Endow-\nment Fund for any assistance to the General Fund. It should however be\nborne in mind that as soon as paper control is released, the expenditure\non printing will rise, so that every effort should be made to increase the\nSociety's income.\nThe Council feel sure that all their members will be glad to learn of the\ngenerous gesture of the publishers of the Journal of Parapsychology (Duke\nUniversity Press, Durham, N. Carolina) in notifying all subscribers who\nare members of our Society that \" those who wished to do so might con-\ntribute the subscription price of four dollars a year to the work of the\nS.P.R. with the compliments of the Parapsychology Laboratory \".\nWith a view to maintaining the financial position of the Society's\nGeneral Fund the Society let on a yearly tenancy from Midsummer three\nrooms on the ground floor to Dr and Mrs Bendit, both of whom are mem-\nbers of the Society, for use as consulting rooms.\nPresidency. Dr Thouless kindly agreed to a third year of office as\nPresident. The Council feel that their and the Society's special thanks are\ndue to him for the great amount of time and care he has devoted to the\nSociety's work at a period of great difficulty.\nObituary. Among the losses by death during 1944, besides Dr T. W.\nMitchell whose death is recorded in the present issue of the Journal, must\nbe mentioned Mr N. M. McWharrie, a very generous benefactor of the\nSociety ; Mr Leopold H. Myers, a son of F. W. H. Myers, of whose\nHuman Personality he edited an abridgment ; Professor R. F. A. Lloernle\nand Miss H. A. Dallas.\nLibrary. We are glad to record an increase in the number of books\nborrowed by members during the year. 86 Members borrowed 669 books as\ncompared with 77 who borrowed 545 books last year ; and 30 books were\nborrowed by the National Central Library for Students.\nMembership of the Society. 47 new Members and 10 Student-\nAssociates were elected, a record for recent years, being equal to 1934 and\nhigher than any other year for the last ten years. The total loss from\ndeaths, resignations etc. is 34, leaving a net increase of 24 in the total\nmembership of the Society, which now stands at 612.\nPublications. One Part of Proceedings was published during the year\n(Part 168) in July.\nThe Secretary's sale to the general public amounted to \u00a338.3.7 and to\nmembers of the Society 44.0.7, and 2,3-4-ii through the Society's Agent\nin the United States, showing an increase of ^(^49 on last year's sale of\nthe Proceedings and Journal.\nMeetings.

Robertson\nBoRLEY Rectory, near Sudbury, Suffolk, is one of the more important\nexamples in recent times of a building said to be associated with certain,\nphenomena usually described by the term \" haunting \". Mr Harry Price\nhas directed much attention to the case, his earlier findings being\npublished in a book entitled The Most Haunted House in England : Ten\nYears Investigation of Borley Rectory. The material presented in this book\ncarries on the story to 1939 : in February of that year the building caught\nfire and was reduced to a ruin. Since then, various further investigations\nhave been carried out, including a number of nocturnal visits by students,\nmostly from St John's College, Cambridge. These form the subject of\nthis report, and I am greatly indebted to my colleagues, without whose\ncollaboration such attention as we have been able to direct to this case\nwould not have been possible.\nThe number of persons who have spent one or more nights at the\nremains of the Rectory during this investigation is fifty-eight, the total\nnumber of visits amounting to twenty-five. In nearly all cases the ap-\nproach of these observers to the question of haunting in general was one\nof some scepticism. About one-third of the investigators reported nothing\nat all out of the ordinary, about another third described incidents which\nthey thought might not be expected to occur in the normal way, and the\nremaining third described events which seemed to them to be definitely\nrather unusual. It seemed to us desirable to record those happenings\nwhich were not obviously explicable in normal terms, even though it\nmight have been possible, with the help of a sufficiency of hypotheses, to\nsuggest a normal explanation for the various incidents. An examination\nof the reports prepared by the various parties of investigators reveals that\nnoises, and in particular sounds of knockings and footsteps, are the most\ncommon of the curious incidents. They have in fact been described by so\nmany of the investigators that it does not seem necessary to doubt the fact\nof their occurrence, although the question of whether it is necessary to\nadvance any explanation for these noises, other than purely normal events,\nas for example doors banging and beams creaking, is a matter on which\nit is perhaps desirable to express more cautious views. Apart from the\n^ Summary of a paper read by Mr. Robertson at a Private Meeting of the Society,\n4 Nov. 1944.\n\fio8 Journal of Society for Psychical Research jan.-feb. 1945\nauditory phenomena, no other effects of relatively frequent occurrence\nhave been observed by us. On a few occasions, however, certain events of\na non-auditory nature were noted : in particular, a few visual impressions,\nsome peculiar temperature effects, two uncertain cases of markings\nappearing in pencil on paper, and one doubtful case of the displacement of\nan object. It is convenient, before discussing the auditory phenomena, to\nconsider briefly some points concerning these other happenings.\nOnly six cases of interesting visual phenomena have been reported\nduring our investigations : they consist of two occasions when one of the\nobservers present thought he saw a luminous patch of light appearing\non the wails for a few seconds, another occasion when an observer who\nwas proceeding to investigate some definite noises resembling footsteps\nthought he saw a black shape which moved from the moonlight into the\nshadows and was not visible on subsequent illuminatioh, and another\ntime when an observer thought he saw a white object crossing the lawn in\nfront of the Rectory. In these four instances only one person witnessed\nthe effect, and since it is so easy to be mistaken with fleeting impressions\nof this kind, it seems desirable to attach little weight to these obsei-vations.\nIt is, however, more difficult to dismiss the two remaining accounts of\nvisual phenomena, since the appearances were of much longer duration\nand were both seen by two observers at the same time. In one case, in\nJune 1943, two investigators on the first floor of the Rectory saw a white\nshape at the base of a tree just outside the building. The shape was\nsom.ewhat globular in outline, and about six feet high. On shining a torch\non it they could see nothing unusual, but on switching oft the torch\nthe shape was again visible. The observers then departed to take some\ntemperature readings, and on their return they could not see the shape.\nThey suggested that the eff ect might have been due to the bark of the tree\nfluorescing. In the other case, in April 1944, an investigator watching the\nruins from the garden reported a white, pale and indistinct light, which he\nsaw hovering over the ruins three times at different places during a period\nof half an hour. On the third occasion he woke up a colleague with him,\nwho also saw the light. Three other observers sleeping in the ruins in the\nregion of this light were not affected in any way.\nMention is made in many accounts of haunting of cold feelings and\nbreezes which are said to accompany the appearance of apparitions, and\nin some cases to arise spontaneously. If these are of an objective nature,\nthey raise problems of some interest from a physical and thermodynamical\nviewpoint. During our visits to the Rectory, we have made altogether\nabout one thousand observations of temperature, mostly at a particular\npoint in the Rectory known as the \" cold spot \", where strong and dis-\nagreeable sensations of cold have sometimes been noted by people who\nstand there. On only one occasion, in June 1943, was any unusual effect\nreported from readings at this place. Two similar mercury thermometers\nwere placed a few inches apart on the \" cold spot \", one being inserted\ninto a glass test-tube through a closely fitting rubber stopper, whereas the\nother was freely exposed to the atmosphere. According to the readings\ntaken by the investigators, the enclosed thermometer cooled to 11\u00b0 F.\nbelow the exposed one. This effect, if not due to an error of some kind,\ncould arise from the operation of a process of heat removal in the neigh-\n\fJAN.-FEB. 1945 Investigatiojis into the Bovley Rectory Case 109\nbourhood of the enclosed thermometer. On another occasion, some rather\nlarge fluctuations in temperature were noted at another part of the Rectory\naway from the \" cold spot \". On repeating the experiments on subsequent\noccasions nothing significant was found, so that it would be unwise to\nregard the experimental data as in any way established. It is in fact\ngenerally true to say that during our investigations at Borley the non-auditory\nphenomena have been so sparse that it does not seem desirable to draw\nany special conclusions from them, except perhaps in a speculative manner.\nTurning finally to a consideration of the auditory phenomena, it is\napparent that these are on the whole rather attenuated in comparison with\nsimilar phenomena which have been described in connection with other\ncases, including the Borley case itself before the fire in 1939. The fre-\nquency with which curious noises have been reported (slightly less than\nhalf the total number of nights) is sufficiently high to enable several\ngeneral features to be discerned. It is, of course, important to note that\nof the effects we have experienced, noises are probably the most likely to\narise from quite normal causes. The noises are variously described by the\ninvestigators as footsteps, knockings, tappings, hammerings, thuds, bangs,\ncracks, rumblings, the padding of feet, the stamping of horse's hooves,\nand whisthngs. They usually consist of a regular repetition of the\nsame sound, or a sequence of similar noises. The duration of the sounds is\nusually only some seconds, but more rarely it may be a considerable num-\nber of minutes. The definite noises have nearly all been experienced in\nthe ruins of the building, the chief exception being the sound of horse's\nhooves which, according to five investigators, arose in the lane outside the\nbuilding. The footsteps appear to be distinguished from the other noises\nby the manner in which they seem to traverse part of the building, pro-\nceeding for example round a room or along a corridor. Thus three inves-\ntigators in September 1942 heard footsteps crossing the room above that in\nwhich they were sitting for several minutes. Again in June 1943 two inves-\ntigators heard many noises, there being at one time a sound as of someone\ntravelling round the room in which they were in, and flicking the walls\nwith a duster. Nothing, however, was visible. In general there appears\nto be no special reason why the footsteps should arise when they do, where-\nas the knockings and thuds are most frequently noted some five or ten\nminutes after an investigator has called on any \" entity \" to demonstrate\nits presence by knocking. For example, two observers in December 1941\nmade this request, suggesting a code of one knock for \" Yes \", two for\n\" No \", and three for \" I don't know \" : five minutes later they heard\nnine double knocks, which according to the code might have replied \" No \"\nnine times. Somewhat similar eftects were noted on other nights, and on\none occasion (July 1944) the knockings continued for three quarters of an\nhour, answering by the code over fifty questions put by the investigators.\nThe situation was rendered rather more complex than usual on this\nnight by the presence of persons endeavouring to fake ghostly phenomena.\nThe five investigators on arriving at Borley found that the Rectory had been\nalmost completely pulled down and removed. They therefore retired to\na small wooden summer house in the garden to sleep. Meanwhile four\nmore students arrived and prepared a faked apparition which, following\nthe general path of a traditional spectral nun, walked several times across\n\fno Journal of Society for Psychical Research jan.-feb. 1945\nthe lawn without being observed. This lack of attention on the part of the\ninvestigators was rectified by some \" poltergeist \" phenomena, whereupon\nthey observed the apparition and were duly impressed, thinking it genuine.\nAt about three a.m. the fakers retired to a haystack for the night, and about\nfifteen minutes later the investigators heard a considerable number of\nfaint knockings coming from somewhere amongst them. After some\nminutes they asked questions, using the code already mentioned. The\nknockings proclaimed their origin to be a nun who had died about 1250,\nand also claimed to have been responsible for the faked apparition and\npoltergeist etfects. It is interesting to note that this erroneous claim\ncorresponds to the ideas which the investigators had at the time, a fact\nsuggesting that the knockings were associated with the investigators in\nsome way, and not with any objective \" entity \".\nThe auditory phenomena we have experienced at Borley have been\nperceived by all the observers in a suitable position to do so (with one\nminor exception) : this makes more difficult any hypothesis based on the\nassumption of the subjective nature of these noises. Another generalisa-\ntion becomes apparent on examining the distribution of the noises with\nrespect to the position of the observers. In nearly every case in which the\nlocation of the noises is described, they are separated from the observers\nby a wall or ceiling : in a very few cases more than one wall intervened,\nand in only one case w^ere the noises produced in the same room as the\nobservers. It is also apparent from our experiences that the noises are\nheard more especially when the observers are in or near a particular room\n(the sewing room). It is very unusual for any noises to be noted when the\nobservers are moving about in the ruins.\nSuch in brief outline are the main facts emerging from our investiga-\ntions. It is clear that any argument for the intervention of some para-\nnormal factor in these experiences would have to be based essentially on\nthe auditory phenomena, and it is precisely these which are most likely\nto arise in a normal manner. The nature of the noises in some cases, and\nthe apparent manifestation of a certain modicum of intelligence in others,\ntogether with the various generalisations already mentioned, render some-\nwhat difficult an explanation in terms of the usual fortuitous happenings\nwhich might be expected to arise in ruined buildings. There is also, of\ncourse, much independent work bearing on the Borley Rectory case.\nBearing these points in mind, I am myself inclined at present to refrain\nfrom expressing very definite views as to the true meaning of our observa-\ntions, but it seems that further investigations into other cases of haunting\nmight yield results of an interesting nature from a physical as well as a\npsychological viewpoint : and possibly some of the indications we have\nobtained may be of some use to future investigators.\nCORRESPONDENCE\nSir,\u2014Dr Wilson's article on \" The Sensitivity of Card-guessing Experi-\nments \" raises a question of some practical importance, since it is desirable\nthat those using card-guessing experiments should use the most economi-\ncal number of alternatives and there is no reason for supposing that the\n\fJAN.-FEB. 1945\n'\nCorrespondence iii\nnumber of alternatives (five) provided in the Zener pack is the most econ-\nomical. I have, in fact, reason for supposing that it is not, and I have\nfound a return to the old-fashioned method of using the 52 alternatives of\nthe pack of playing cards gives a more sensitive method of experimenting.\nBut we do not know that 52 is the right number to use; it may be 100 or a\nhigher number.\nDr Wilson is undoubtedly correct in saying that if the number of cor-\nrectly cognised cards is independent of the number of alternatives then the\nsensitivity of the experiment will increase with the number of alternative\nchoices. But if the number of correctly cognised cards is not independent of\nthe number of alternatives, then the determination of what kind of pack will\nbe most sensitive is a matter of experiment and not merety of mathematics.\nI have some experimental evidence bearing on this question. First, I\nfound {British Journal of Psychology, July 1942), that if success in guessing\nplaying cards was scored by the number of times the hit was on the num-\nber instead of on the whole card, the deviation from expectation was just\nabout the same in the two cases. But the sensitivity of the experiment\nwas, of course, greater when the guess was on the whole card since the\nmean chance expectation was lower. Many years before I had pointed\nout that the same thing was found in Coover's card-guessing experiment\n{Proc, S.P.R. XLIII). So sensitivity is raised by increasing the number\nof alternatives from 13 to 52.\nOn the other hand, I had some indications that it v.as of no use to try\nindefinitely to increase the sensitivity of the experiment by increasing the\nnumber of alternative choices. When I substituted 3 -figure numbers as\nthe material to be guessed, I had no successes at all. So with 999 alter-\nnatives, the rate of scoring was zero. It is true that, by this time, my rate\nof scoring with the playing cards had also become low. But it was not\nzero and the same proportion of successes with the three-figure numbers\nas was at the same time obtained with playing cards would have given a\nhighly significant result. So it appears that the number of rightly cognised\nguesses may not be independent of the number of choices, but may go\ndown after the number of choices is made too high.\nI should, of course, have liked at this stage to go on to determine what\nwas the optimal number of alternative choices for maximum sensitivity of\nthe experiment, but the rate of scoring was too low for this to be possible.\nFor the solution of the problem we should need a subject who consistently\nscored at a high rate. Mrs Goldney and Mr Soal have been working with\nsuch a subject. Other psychical research workers would be grateful to\nthem if they would obtain a solution of this problem.\nI have assumed in the above discussion that the number of alternative\nchoices is the only factor determining frequency of correctly cognised\nresponses. I think it is doubtful whether this is the case. I found that\nusing the conventional five alternative choices I got no significant difii'er-\nence from mean chance expectation when guessing Zener cards and vv'hen\nguessing five difterent colours, but a significant excess of right guesses\nwhen the problem was to guess the number of dots on cards with i, 2, 3,\n4, or 5 dots. Apparently the difference between the numbers from i to 5\nwas more interesting (or for some other reason more eft'ective in determin-\ning responses) than the difl^erences between Zener cards or the difl^erences\n\f112 Journal of Society for Psychical Research jan.-feb. 1945\nbetween colours. Failure to guess the three-figure numbers may, there-\nfore, be due to the sam.e kind of difficulty and not merely to the large num-\nber of alternatives. It must be remembered that Mr Whately Carington\nhas had positive results with picture guessing experiments where the num-\nber of alternatives is indefinitely large.\nThis consideration removes the problem of getting maximum sensitivity\neven further from the region of mathematics. Nor is it likely that the\nproblem of the optima! kind of guess can be solved for us by any other\nexperimenter. It may well be an individual factor and it may be necessary\nfor every experimenter to find out for his own subjects, what kind of\nguesses they can most easily make.\nThe simple problem still remains. Within any one kind of material\nwhat is the number of choices that will give maximum sensitivity to a\ncard-guessing experiment? Dr Wilson has asked the question. It is for\nsomiC experimenter to answer it.\nYours etc.,\nR. H. Thouless\nSir,\u2014In a letter to the Journal of Nov.-Dec, 1944, Sir Ernest Bennett,\ncomplaining of the evidential standard of two recent Journal cases (Vol.\nXXXIII, pp. 34-40 and pp. 72-74), contrives to give a distorted account of\nboth. Without claiming that these are among the best cases on record,\nit may yet be pointed out that the strength of the first lies in the fact that a\nmeticulously accurate witness stated that she and her sister had lived for\nthree years in a house which, they had never heard was haunted and had\ndecided to leave it at the end of that time on account of their haunt-like\nexperiences. What explanation does Sir Ernest Bennett suggest.'' Vivid\nimagination coupled vv'ith chance, or that the witness was deliberately\nfalsifying the facts?\nThe whole of the witnesses' account was naturally published, although\nit was pointed out that the chance-factor in respect of some of the details\nwas difficult to estimate. A normal, though improbable, explanation was\nsuggested for the bent railing ; but a detailed examination of this showed\nthat Sir Ernest Bennett's view that it v\/as \" obviously due to a motor\nvehicle \" would have been more satisfactory to Dr Watson than to\nSherlock Holmes.\nWith regard to the second case, if Sir Ernest Bennett refers to the early\ncases published by the S.P.R., he will find that many of them were not\nrecorded till long after the event. He again m.isrepresents the evidential\nstanding of the case by quoting incidental remarks of the witness as if they\nformed the principal evidence on which the case depends.\nYours etc.,\nG. N. M. Tyrrell\nSir,\u2014May a member of the rank and file ask for guidance? In the Novem-\nber-December number of the Journal Sir Ernest Bennett pleads for more\nscientific standards of evidence in the Society's publications. He then\nrefers to the Haunted House case in the Nov.-Dec. No. of '43 and states\nthat slight damage to a garden wall was \" obviously due to a motor vehicle.\"\n\fJAN.-FEB. 1945 Correspondence \"3\nDid he examine the wall at the time? If not, how is he, by his own stand-\nards, able to make so categorical a statement in the face of detailed technical\nreasons against such a view given by a trained engineer and research\nworker, who had seen the wall.-' He then mentions only \" the bad smell\nin the bathroom \" but not that a similar smell was reported to occur in\nother places and on each occasion disappeared by itself. One could wish\nphysically caused bad smells shared this good habit. And so on with\nother pieces of evidence. Is not Mr Tyrrell's the more scientific attitude?\nHe merely records that an unusual number of unpleasant events occurred\nin a given time, that for some of them no physical cause could be traced\nand that subsequently it was learned that before these events the house\nwas said to have a bad reputation. He then suggests that it would be\ninteresting to observe if such events continue.\nSir Ernest comments on the apparitional case in the Sept. -Oct. number\nof the Journal, 1944, and seems to imply that because the percipient uses that\nilltreated word \" psychic \" and writes \" I often seem to know when things\nare going to happen \" she must either be a fool or a knave. Why does the\nfact that the percipient uses simple rather than technical wording make\nher account less worthy of credence? She might have written \" I have\nknown my maid receive apparent spontaneous extra sensory impressions\nresembling those induced experim.entally by Carington and Soal. I myself\nhave frequently experienced what appeared to be precognitive extra sen-\nsory impressions.\" Could we then have taken her seriously?\nI am not competent to comment on Sir Ernest's third cause of distress,\nDr Layard's paper. Mr Dingwall says that the theory that \" poltergeist\nphenomena are telekinetic expressions of unconscious conflict in the mind\nof the agent \" is commonplace to our leaders. In that case do not we of\nthe rank and file owe our thanks to Dr Layard for having been the first to\nattempt to step it down to us ? And is it not a matter of interest that such\na theory should have been arrived at, though possibly in a more intuitive\nmanner, by an expert in another branch of research?\nYours, etc.,\n,\n- \u2022\nRosalind Heywood\nSir,\u2014I agree with those members of the Society who have been writing to\nyou to protest against some of the papers and cases recently printed. But\nas my objections are of considerably wider scope, including even contribu-\ntions by one of the protestants, it may be judicious for me to abstain on this\noccasion. I must, however, protest against the editorial note on page 96 of\nthe current number of the Jouynal. If \" the Journal prints the best cases\nthat it can get \" is a considered statement of policy, then it implies an\nabandonment of critical standards which will inevitably relegate the\nSociety to the level of a non-scientific body. If not, this unfortunate\nphrase had better be withdrawn quickly and emphatically.\nYours, etc.,\nTheodore Besterman\n(The note in question did not say that the Journal is prepared to print\nstories which should not be classed as cases. Considered criticism of our\n\f114 ' Journal of Society for Psychical Research jan.-feb. 1945\nstandard is far from unwelcome ; but the main need is for more material\nof high quality, and we look expectantly to our critics for help in bringing\nsuch material to light.\n\u2014\nEd.)\nSir,\u2014Although less competent than others to criticise Dr Layard's paper,\nthe undersigned younger members of the Society deprecate its publication\nwithout comment in Proceedings.

Harrison\nSir,\u2014It is with some cheerfulness that I have read the renewed criticisms\nof my paper which have appeared in your November-December issue,\nsince it has dawned on my simple mind that the lowering of the standard\nof publication by the S.P.R. about which four out of the six correspondents\ncomplain has not come from my serious contribution but from the cloud of\nlargely personal and often ignorant abuse that has emanated from\u00bb these\nmembers themselves.\nIn fact, this exhibition . itself illustrates on the psychological level\nprecisely what poltergeist phenomena do on the spiritual level, namely\nthat when the solution of a knotty problem is in sight but is at the same\ntime blocked by prejudice, that is the moment when dirt begins to fly.\nThis parallel is not a witty joke but is a true parallel, because sarcasm\ninstead of argument issues from the mouth or pen for just the same reasons\nas inanimate objects become wantonly activated, that is to say through the\ntension produced in the human soul by being brought face to face with\nsome deep inner truth which the one-sided intellect refuses to accept.\nThe power thus generated then gets out of control and runs amok.\nThis correspondence has been a perfect if not very edifying example of\nthis none too uncommon phenomenon. Each correspondent is fighting\nblindly for \" truth \", and, as such, receives my respect, but, being blind in\none eye (the psi eye), he misses the mark and his arrow nearly manages, as\nin all such cases, to kill the very thing he needs. For years this Society has\nplayed cat-and-mouse with its own marvellous material, being fascinated\nby it (as is the mouse) but at the same time killing it by slow degrees (as\ndoes the cat). The stalemate thus produced is at first irritating but finally\nbecomes a habit, and bad habits (including intellectual ones) fight like the\ndevil against any solution of their deadlock.\nMr Carington complains that Dr Thouless and Dr Wiesner have missed\nthe point. They are the only ones who have seen it, apart from many\nprivate correspondents who, on seeing offprints, have written \" Is the S.P.R.\nat last going to move? \". He also complains that it is such uphill work\nto persuade the scientific world to take the S.P.R. seriously. It certainly\nwill not take them seriously if this is the kind of reception considered\ncontributions receive. Nor can I add anything more in the course of a\nshort letter in answer to his renewed enquiry regarding causal connexions\n\fJAN.-FEB. 1945 Correspondence \"5\nthan what I have already said in my paper and subsequent letter appearing\nin your September-October issue, except to repeat what I have said in both\nplaces, namely that I do not claim to have proved anything, but simply to\nhave put forward a few cases out of many possible ones as a basis for\nfuture research. That such research will be carried out and brought to\na successful conclusion I have no doubt. Psychologists have great wealth\nof material to support it, though they are handicapped in producing it on\naccount of the confidential nature of much of their information. But the\npsychical research worker has no such check placed on his activities, and\nshould take advantage of it, though he will have to have psychologists to\nhelp him.\nDr Dingwall interests me, since, while maintaining the standard of this\ncorrespondence in the generally devaluing tone of his remarks, having\nreferred to my paper in one phrase as being \" almost unintelligible \" he in\nthe same sentence shows his perfect grasp of it and proceeds to support\nalmost all my contentions while at the same time claiming them as his own.\nThis is of course quite typical of a mind that works brilliantly along one\ntrack but unwittingly contradicts itself by totally denying the other. I\nwillingly concede to him a few verbal inaccuracies such as the use of the\nterm \" poltergeist \" instead of \" poltergeist phenomena \", but do not in\n:any way go back on my suggestion that psi (meaning the un-named force)\nuses not only visual impressions (to which, since he mentions them, I will\nadd noises) but also actual objects with which to convey its message. I\nalso plead guilty to not having seen Dr Meier's article in the Zentralblatt\nto which he refers and which is unobtainable in Oxford, but the whole text\n(in English) of the paper from which I quoted and which was delivered to\nthe Psychological Club in Zurich in 1938 has been sent to the head-\nquarters of the S.P.R. to be copied for reference in case anyone wishes to\nsee it. I am particularly grateful to him for providing, with his wide\ntechnical knowledge further valuable support for my thesis regarding the\ncausation and purpose of poltergeist phenomena by so aptlv recalling the\ncase of the Cure d'Ars. For this saint was well aware of the message con-\ntained in the poltergeist phenomena that assailed him over a period of\nthirty-five years (from 1824 to 1858), which he considered to be due to the\nconiiict between what he regarded as the powers of good and evil raging\naround his saintly person, a conflict he never fully resolved and which\ntherefore declared itself in this way. At first terrified bv them, he finally\ncame to recognise them as always heralding the resolution of some par-\nticular conflict, declaring that \" when the persecution to which he was\nsubjected was more than usually violent, he received it as a sign of some\nsignal mercy or some special consolation about to be granted to him \"\n{The Cure D'Ars, by G. Molyneu,x, London, 1868, pp. 246-7). Some-\ntimes the resolution of conflict that the phenomena heralded was not his\nown but that of others, as on many occasions when pilgrims who were\ngreat sinners came to him from a distance in order to be confessed by him\ntheir approach was accompanied by especially violent phenomena {ibid.,\np. 426, and The Secret of the Cure D'Ars, by Henri Gheon, London, 1929,\np. 153. I take these references from books I happen to have to hand,\nbut similar statements occur in all the accounts). As for the special\nmessages conveyed, in the particularly humiliating instance mentioned by\n\fii6 Journal of Society for Psychical Research jan.-feb. 1945\nDr Dingwall of the Cure's favourite devotional picture of the Assumption\nbeing covered with excrement the message is clear, namely that he had not\nyet achieved within his psyche a true synthesis between the highest and\nthe lowest, and that this was a problem he still had to tackle.\nThis correspondence has already occupied far too much of your valuable\nspace, so that I will not waste ink or time combating further pinpricks.\nThe last letter by Sir Ernest Bennett is best passed over in silence.\nIn winding up this correspondence and thanking the Committee of\nReference for its support, I should like to point out one thing, which is that,\nwhat my paper was really about was the healing of split human souls.\nYours faithfully,\n\"\nJohn Layard\n(This correspondence must now cease.\n\u2014\nEd.)\nTHE JOURNAL IS PRINTED FOR PRIVATE :\nCIRCULATION\nThe attention of Members and Associates is drawn to the private nature\nof the Journal, from which no quotations should be made without the\nprevious consent of the Council.

Salter moved the\nadoption of the Annual Report and the Accounts of the Society, which had\nalready been circulated in the January-February Journal. This resolution\nwas seconded by Mr G. N. M. Tyrrell, and carried unanimously.\nThe Chairman announced that since the circulation of the Statutory\n\f120 Journal of Society for Psychical Research mar.-apr. 1945\nNotice Lord Balfour, one of the six members due to retire by rotation, had\ndied, and Mrs K. M. Goldney (hitherto a co-opted member of Council)\nhad been proposed to fill the vacancy. No other candidates having been\nproposed, the following six members were accordingly unanimously\nelected : Sir Ernest Bennett, M.P., Mrs K. M. Goldney, Dr S. G. Soal, the\nRev. C. Drayton Thomas, Dr R. H. Thouless and Mr G. N. M. Tyrrell.\nOn the proposal of Mr W. H. Salter, seconded by Mrs W. H. Salter,\nMessrs Miall, Savage, Avery & Co. were re-elected Auditors for the forth-\ncoming year.\nPRIVATE MEETINGS\nThe 182nd Private Meeting of the Society was held in the Library on\nSaturday, 24 February 1945, after the Annual General Meeting. Dr\nR. H. Thouless read a paper on \"An Experiment on Symbolism in Tele-\npathy\".\nThe 183rd Private Meeting of the Society was held in the Library on\nSaturday 24th March 1945, when Dr E. J. Dingwall read a paper on\n\" Lights and Shadows on D. D. Home \". Dr Dingwall has kindly left a\ncopy of his paper with the Secretary, who will send it to any member wish-\ning to read it, on receipt of the postage.\nOBITUARY\nWe learn with deep regret of the death of Dr Angelos Tanagras of Athens,\nan Honorary Associate of our Society, and a leading member of the\nHellenic S.P.R.\nDr Tanagras took the initiative in promoting the Fourth International\nCongress for Psychical Research held in Athens in 1930, and it was largely\ndue to his friendliness and tact that the Congress proved so enjoyable to all\nwho took part in it. He actively co-operated with the S.P.R. in long-range\ntelepathy experiments between Athens and London.\nThe time and circumstances of his death are at present unknown to us.\nHONOURS TO S.P.R. MEMBERS\nOur members will learn with lively gratification that the University of\nLondon has conferred the degree of Doctor of Science on our Council\nMember, Dr S. G. Soal, for his work in E.S.P., and will wish to congratulate\nhim on this distinction which crowns many years of difficult, ingenious and\npatient research.\nLast Summer our member the Rev. V. G. Kirk-Duncan of Magdalen\nCollege, Oxford, was awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy by\nOxford University for \" A Study of Certain Aspects of Prima Facie Extra-\nsensory Cognition \".\nThus in little over a year Oxford, Cambridge (Dr Bendit) and London\nUniversities have each for the first time awarded the degree of Doctor for\nwork in psychical research.\n\fMAR.-APR. 1945 Precognition and the Uncertainty Principle 121\nPRECOGNITION AND THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE\nA Note by Richard Wilson\n1. Heisenberg's Principle of Uncertainty states that if we have two con-\njugated co-ordinates p, q (such that pq is an \" action \"),\nthen if^ is measured to an accuracy Ap, an inaccuracy in q is introduced\nwhich has an average value Aq where Ap, Aq = h, h being Planck's\nuniversal Quantum of Action.\n2. Lord CherwelVs fundamental thesis.\nIn his book \" The Physical significance of the Quantum Theory \" Lord\nCherwell builds up Quantum Mechanics from a fundamental thesis, which\ncan briefly be stated as follows :\n{a) The present conceptions of space and time are inadequate to\ndescribe atomic phenomena ; the concept of length depends on the use\nof a measuring rod which cannot be used without disturbing the bodies\nwhose distance apart we desire to measure.\n{b) The human mind developed these concepts of length by considera-\ntion of the common macroscopic phenomena. It is incapable of con-\nsidering a more fundamental system.\n(c) We must pay the price for our inadequate representation of reality ;\nthe price being Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.\n(d) It is of no value to discuss a co-ordinate of a particle unless we con-\nsider that we have measured the co-ordinate.\n(e) If we do so measure the co-ordinate to an accuracy Ap intro-\nduce an average error in the conjugate co-ordinate of Aq where\nAp, Aq = h.\n(\/) The time integral of any co-ordinate must be equal to the classical\nvalue calculated for that co-ordinate. \\\nUsing this thesis, Lord Cherwell deduces Sommerveld's fundamental\nassumptions, and Pauli's Principle, and reconciles the Fermi-Dirac and\nEinstein- Bose statistics.\n3. Application to E.S.P.\nLord Cherwell 's thesis does satisfy many of the requirements of\nQuantum Mechanics. We may therefore take it as a basis upon which to\nbuild a theory of E.S.P.\nAssumption i.\nE.S.P. is a physical process or semi-physical process.\nAssumption 2.\nIt requires a certain amount of energy E, where \u00a3 is a function of the\nsensitive concerned.\n\f122 Journal of Society for Psychical Research mar.-apr. 1945\nObservation i.\nThe conjugated co-ordinate of Energy is Time. ;\nObservation 2.\nThe energy capable of being used is probably very small, for it has not\nyet been detected. \" -\nObservation 2-\nIt is no use discussing the magnitude of this energy unless we attribute\nto the conjugated co-ordinate\u2014time\u2014the appropriate average error.\nObservation 4.\n: The maximum average error with which we can measure E, is E itself\n_\nfor the time-integral of the error is zero and we cannot have a negative\nenergy.\nDeduction.\nThere is an inaccuracy Zl; in the time where \u2022\n.\nAt.E = h= J X 10^^'' erg.sec. \" '\n' *\n4. Suggestion fur an Inaccuracy theory of E.S.P.\n(a) If an energy S is used for a certain cognition, then an average error of\nhjE results in the time.\nThis appears to occur in the case of Mr Basil Shackleton. He either\ncognises 3 seconds in advance or 3 seconds in retard. It appears, therefore,\nthat for the conditions of the Soal-Goldney experiments, Basil Shackleton\nhas a value of\nE = h\/2 sees. =2 X io~^' ergs.\nIf this is true it is no wonder that E has not yet been detected.\nPresumably the error varies about the mean value by a Gaussian Error\nlaw. This ought to be verified\u2014or otherwise\u2014by experiments with more\naccurate timing.\n(b) A sensitive who has some sort of vision may have a clear, distinct\nimage. If this is so, one would expect him to be vague about time.\nCORRESPONDENCE\nSir,\u2014We are comparatively new members of the Society. But for some\nyears we have felt that a time must soon come when it would have to take\nstock of itself and its position in the scientific world. For, according to\nwhat it decides, it can either keep alive the pioneer spirit of its founders,\nwho, despite the unpopularity of the subject, set to work and established\npsychical research on a scientific footing, or else it can become a kind of\ngeological museum of dead facts, carefully docketed and labelled and\nlocked away in cases\u2014and as dreary as only a geological museum can be.\nRecent events and correspondence seem to show that this time has come.\nThe crux of the matter seems to be whether we are to be allowed to con-\nsider new ways of approach to the problems of the human psyche, which\ninvolve subjective experience, or whether we are to be compelled to stick\n\fMAR.-APR. 1945 Correspondence 123\nclosely to what its protagonists still believe to be the only scientific attitude,\neliminating from our researches everything but objective assessment.\nLet us not, from the first, be misled into thinking that the highly vocal\nsection of the membership which, in the sacred name of Science, deplores\nand decries what it claims to be a depreciation of critical standards, is\nactually being scientific : it might have been, fifty years ago. But science\nhas changed, and nowhere more so than in the field of psychology, of\nwhich psychical research is a branch. Originally, science was defined as\nmeasurement. This was enough where the physical sciences were con-\ncerned. But biology meant that the definition had to be extended to\ninclude the assessment of facts, observed by the human mind, but often\nunable to be measured by the physical yardstick. When it came to the\nstudy of the mind itself, still further extension was needed. Behaviourist\npsychology was a failure for the simple reason that it told us nothing about\nthe psyche except from the very outermost fringes. It was found necessary\nto include, besides assessment of fact, assessment of meaning and values :\ni.e., the subjective field, and one almost entirely beyond the scope of the old\nmethods. And here the scientific mind (\" scientific \" means knowledge-\nmaking, let us remember) had to adopt a new standpoint, and to be willing\nto study and consider material of an elusive and intangible kind, but never-\ntheless essential to any real understanding of the subject. Science thus\ntook up the attitude expressed by Professor MacMurray when he said that\nno statement or opinion expressed must be considered as entirely untrue :\nif it were quite untrue, it would not have been made. The task became, not\none of sticking labels, \" True \" or \" False \" on to such things, but to see\nwherein the truth lay, and how it fitted in with or modified other established\nknowledge.\nThis is what some people tell us we must not do, because to do so means\nabandoning objective standards. But the real scientist is surely one who is\nconcerned first and foremost with trying to understand his material, and\nwho himself remains objective whether the material be itself subjective or\nobjective.\nExperimental work is essential, and has been well done in the past. We\nneed have no fears that it will not go on being well done in the future. But,\nif we want to understand the human mind, it is surely equally essential to be\nwilling to study the fruits of subjective experience as well. The experi-\nmentalist is the map-maker of the psyche. But one gets only a very flat\nidea of a country by studying a map. One needs to add to what the sur-\nveyor tells us, the far less objective and accurate results of what the painter\nor the photographer shows us. But this is precisely what the objectors do\nnot want us to do.\nWe joined the S.P.R. because we wanted to get to know about matters\npsychical in their relation to the mind in general. We imagine that in this\nwe are not alone, and that the majority of the members, like ourselves, are\nmore interested in the subject itself than in the question whether it is\napproached by one particular road or by another, or by many. And it\nwould surely be wrong, as well as in the true sense unscientific, to allow\nourselves to be tied down to an orthodoxy which is really outworn and\noutmoded. Granted that critical standards must be upheld: but there are\nmany more ways than one of upholding these, and we sincerely trust that\n\f124 Journal of Society for Psychical Research mar-apr. 1945\nthose responsible for the policy of the Society will insist on this eclec-\nticism, and not allow it to be forced into a narrow dogmatic channel from\nwhich no departure is allowed.\nYours etc.,\nLaurence J. Bendit\nPhoebe D. Bendit\nSir,\u2014\" The Sensitivity of Card-guessing Experiments \" by Dr Wilson,\nand Dr Thouless' subsequent letter, will have been read with especial\ninterest by those who contemplate the design of apparatus which involves\nthe use of selector mechanism for determining, in a random fashion, the\nsequence of symbols which is to be presented to the subject ; for the\nflexibility of such apparatus (in relation to probability of success per trial)\nhas obviously to be considered in the initial stages of design.\nWhile few designers would care to choose a probability of (say) on\naccount of the complexity of the switching system, it is suggested that\nprobabilities between \\ and yo might reasonably be considered, from the\ntechnical aspect.\nWithin the limits mentioned above, and bearing in mind particularly the\nquestion of sensitivity, it would appear that the most suitable probability is\nj^, for the reasons following :\nIt is assumed that most apparatus will make use of commutators or\nanalogous switching systems. If the apparatus is designed to operate with\nthe standard probability of \\, no flexibility in probability is normally\npossible\u2014that is to say, one cannot readily make adjustments to alter the\nprobability of success per trial, for the reason that five commutator seg-\nments cannot be grouped so as to bring about a balanced change. Here we\nsee evidence of the vice inherent in commutators when employed for the\npurposes under review. Suppose, however, that a probability of has\nbeen chosen for the apparatus for the following additional probabilities\n\u2014\n\\, J, |. Thus it will be seen that a probability of xe will give a flexibility to\nthe apparatus which would not be possible with any other value within the\nlimits mentioned above.\nOn the other hand, it must be acknowledged that the proposal to\nabandon entirely the probability of \\ is not without its disadvantages, in\nview of the various tables which are available for use in respect of a proba-\nbility of success per trial of \\. If the sacrifice in this respect seems to be\ntoo great, then the apparatus could be designed to operate with a proba-\nbility of which will permit of adjustments to give, in addition, proba-\nbilities of Yo 3nd 3:. But there are reasons, peculiar to test apparatus of the\ntype with which we are here concerned, which lead me to suppose that -jV\nis to be preferred\u2014quite apart from flexibility per se.\nIt may be that some apparatus about to be designed would not permit of\nadjustments calculated to give a flexibility of the type described ; but I\nfind it difficult to visualize a case in which the principles outlined above\nwould not apply.\nYours, etc.,\nGeoffrey Redmayne\n\fJOURNAL OF THE\nSOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH\nfor Private Circulation amongst Members and Associates only\nMay, 1945 - Vol. XXXIII\u2014No. 614\nNotice of Meeting\nNew Members\nMeeting of the Council\nDiscussion Meeting\nMiss Cummins Case\nCorrespondence -\nCONTENTS\nPAGE\n125\n------- 126\n126\n126\n126\n130\nNOTICE OF MEETING\nA GENERAL MEETING OF THE SOCIETY\nwill be held at\nManson House, Portland Place\n, ON _\nWednesday, 20 June, 1945 at 6 p.m.\nWHEN\nTHE PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS\nWILL BE DELIVERED BY\nMr G.

Trinder on \" Dowsing \".\nSOME RECENT COMMUNICATIONS RECEIVED\nTHROUGH MISS GERALDINE CUMMINS\nMiss Gibbes reports to the Society the following case of communications\nreceived by her through Miss Geraldine Cummins from a friend of Miss\nGibbes, of whose death Miss Cummins, then living in Eire, had not heard.\nSeveral correct statements were made as regards facts unknown to Miss\nCummins, some of them being also unknown to Miss Gibbes. Pseudo-\nnyms are used for the names (other than the Christian name) of this friend\nand of her family and her residence.\nIn December 1943 a Mrs Alice Horley of Brickhill near Longmead,\n\u2014shire, died and her death was reported in the English press. Mrs\nHorley had been an acquaintance of Miss Gibbes, and a friend of her\n\fMAY 1945 Miss Cummins Case 127\nsister-in-law, Hilda, who died in 1941. From Hilda Miss Gibbes has\nreceived several communications through Miss Cummins, some of which\nare reported in the Journal for May-June 1942. The nephew, Nigel, there\nmentioned as having been wounded, died in 1942 of wounds.\nMiss Gibbes had been in the habit, while Miss Cummins was resident\nin Ireland, of sending to her from time to time letters to various dead\nfriends asking her to get into touch with them and obtain their replies.\nFollowing this practice Miss Gibbes on the 21st December 1943 wrote to\nHilda through Miss Cummins mentioning that her friend \" Alice \" had\npassed over, that she would remember that \" she \" did not particularly\nreciprocate \" Alice's \" affections for her, and requesting her, if they met,\nto tell \" Alice \" how sorry Miss Gibbes was not to have replied to \" Alice's\n\"\nlast letter, as she was on the point of doing when she had seen \" Alice's\n\"\ndeath announced in the Times, after an operation. On the ist January\n1944 Hilda replied that she would look out for \" Alice \".\nMiss Cummins (see her statement below) had heard of Mrs Horley from\nMiss Gibbes in 1938, but did not know that Alice was her name, or that\nshe had died. She did not while in Eire see the Times or any English\nnewspaper in which Mrs Horley's death was likely to have been announced.\nOn the 31st December 1943 Miss Gibbes wrote to Nigel through Miss\nCummins, without mentioning Mrs Horley. In the course of his reply,\non the 8th January 1944, he said \" I saw that old dame, Mrs Hawley, just\nfor a moment. She isn't over here, is she? \" On the 29th January 1944\nhe wrote again, mentioning Mrs Hawley, and referring correctly in very\ncharacteristic language to the relations between her and his mother, Hilda.\nIt is to be noted that Nigel, when alive, had been well aware how Mrs\nHorley spelt her name.\nFor several months no further allusion was made to Mrs Horley except\na casual remark from Hilda saying that she was always rather shy of\npolitical women \" even of Alice \" : Mrs Horley's husband had been an\nM.P. for several years.\nOn the 17th August 1944 Miss Gibbes sent a few lines to Hilda in which\nshe casually asked \" What of Alice? \", and received a reply dated 26th\nAugust 1944, \"... Oh, Alice. Well, I played hide and seek with her for a\nlong time. ... I was a little afraid it wouldn't be a case of Alice for Short\nbut Alice for Long, if we met. I used if you remember to find her at times\ntoo talkative. .\n..\" These remarks are extremely characteristic of Hilda.\nWith this message was sent a script, the last page of which ran as follows :\n\" Astor [a control of Miss Cummins]. There is a lady here with Hilda,\na stranger\u2014elderly I think when she passed to us. She wants to try and\nwrite.\n\" Brickhill. Is this Brickhill? It is so dimly lighted. I was looking\nfor Harry, Henry. . . . Hilda says write to Bea [Miss Gibbes] . . . (Miss\nCummins asked the writer's name). My name? Oh yes, it's Alice Poole,\nno Pole, Longmead . . . Mrs Alice Pole (these words were followed by a\nscrawl, apparently meant for an attempted surname).\" The script went\non to refer to Alice's death in a nursing home, and to the letter which Miss\nGibbes had intended to write to her, matters stated or implied in Miss\nGibbes' letter of 21st December 1943, and ended \" I am the same old\nwoman, but not so very old\u2014well-preserved.\" In forwarding these scripts\n\f128 Journal of Society for Psychical Research MAY 1945\nMiss Cummins wrote, \"The Alice lady had great difficulty in writing. I\nsuppose it's the one you mention in your letter to Hilda or is it some other\nAlice? Or is she subconscious invention?\"\nBrickhill was the name of Mrs Horley's house : this was not known to\nMiss Cummins, who however may have known of her connection with\nLongmead : see paragraphs i and 3 of her statement below. Henry is her\nhusband's name. The most interesting point, however, is the name\n\" Poole \", corrected to \" Pole \" ;\n\" Pole \" was Mrs Horley's second name,\na fact unknown to Miss Cummins, and also, at the time she received the\nscript, to Miss Gibbes, but the family pronounce it \" Poole \". The final\nremark about being \" well-preserved \" is described by Miss Gibbes as\ncharacteristic of Mrs Horley.\nOn the 3rd October 1944 a script was written by Miss Cummins con-\ntaining the following passage :\n\" Astor is here. Harold and Hilda are\nclose by and I see Muriel with an elderly lady who passed over fairly\nrecently. I think it is the lady, Alice, and with her now is a man and I\ncatch the name of Draper. (Here Miss Cummins asked Astor to tell her\nabout Alice.) Yes he is Draper or some name like that. He thanks Muriel\nfor having brought him and the lady, Alice, together. ...\" In the latter\npart of the script further reference is made to the relations between Hilda\nand Mrs Horley. Mention is also made of Mrs Horley's love of flowers,\nknown to Miss Cummins, and of Mr Horley's career as a public speaker\nand politician. At the same time Hilda wrote about Alice, saying she had\nbeen impressed by Muriel's gift for making a garden, and \" At any rate\nMuriel did one real service to Alice : she found her father for her.\"\nAfter the end of Hilda's letter the writing changed, and the script pro-\nceeded :\n\" Alice Pole. My dear, have you seen my husband? He is very\nlow I feel. I saw his mind or a bit of it and it told me he didn't at all like\n\u2014\nas Hilda put it\u2014the Beveridge England is going to be given. . . . What a\npity you don't know him better for you could tell him he won't have to\nlive in a Beveridged England. He will be here with me. Charming and\nkind miss M found my dear father and brought us together. It has\ngiven me great happiness. Address to send this to,\nMiss Beatrice Gibbes\n23 Jubilee Place\nfrom Alice Pole.\"\nHarold and Muriel (Miss M ) are a brother and sister of Hilda's.\nThe error as to the number of Miss Gibbes 's house, which is 25, not 23\nJubilee Place, is very curious, since the real number was well-known to\nMiss Cummins.\nThis group of communications is largely concerned with Mrs Horley's\nhusband. Miss Cummins was not aware that he had survived his wife, and\nin view of his age, it was not an inference which could have been made with\nany certainty. The allusion to his political opinions is correct, but not in view\nof his position definitely significant. The most interesting feature of Alice's\ncommunication is the name Draper, which meant nothing at the time to\neither Miss Cummins or Miss Gibbes. On the 14th October 1944 Miss\nGibbes discovered from Who's Who (1925 edn.) that Mrs Horley was the\ndaughter of P. H. D. Roe, the initials only of the first three names being\n\fMAY 1945 Miss Ctmmins Case 129\ngiven. Thinking that the D was encouraging, Miss Gibbes wrote to the\npostmaster of the place mentioned in Who's Who as P. H. D. Roe's home,\nenquiring as to his full names. The postmaster forwarded her letter to a\nmember of the family, who on the 22nd October 1944 wrote informing\nMiss Gibbes that his full name was Pole Henry Draper Roe.\nThe relevant parts of the original scripts of 26th August and 3rd October\n1944 have been seen by the Hon. Secretary.\nThe significance of this case obviously depends on the extent of Miss\nCummins's normal knowledge of Mrs Horley. The Hon. Sec. accordingly\nput to Miss Cummins in March 1945, when she was back in England,\nsome questions which, with her answers (dated 24th March 1945), are set\nout below. The questions were enclosed in a letter to Miss Gibbes who\nread them out to Miss Cummins.\nQ. I. Did you ever know the Mrs Horley who died in Dec. 1943?\nHad you ever heard of her before the 3rd Oct. '44?\nA. I. I never knew Mrs Horley. But when I was staying with Miss\nGibbes's sister-in-law [i.e. Hilda] some time in 1938 I remembered that\nMiss Gibbes had told me that Mrs Horley was a friend of her sister-in-law,\nwas fond of gardening and lived in the neighbourhood.\nQ. 2. Did you before that date know of any connection between her\nand any of Miss Gibbes's relations?\nA. 2. Is answered in above.\nQ. 3. Before that date did the names Alice, Pole, Draper, Brickhill\nmean anything to you in connection with each other, or with Mrs Horley.\nA. 3. None whatever.\nQ. 4. While you were in Ireland in 1944 did you see any, and which,\nEnglish newspapers?\nA. 4. The Times Literary Supplement, The Irish Edition of the Sunday\nDispatch were the only English newspapers I saw when I was in Ireland.\nQ. 5. Do you think it possible you may have seen a reference to Mrs\nHorley in any newspaper, English or Irish, about the time of her death?\nA. 5. No. None whatever. In fact until a few minutes ago I had no\nidea that Mrs Horley had died when Miss Gibbes told me.\nIn a letter to the Hon. Sec. accompanying Miss Cummins's answers.\nMiss Gibbes states that before putting the questions, she led up to them\nby a conversation in which Miss Cummins spoke of Mrs Horley as if she\nwere still alive. It was on this occasion. Miss Gibbes says, that Miss\nCummins first learnt that \" Alice \" was Mrs Horley. When Miss Gibbes\nread the first question. Miss Cummins asked how the name Horley\nshould be spelt. This is of interest because at a sitting shortly before\nAstor had spelt the name correctly. Miss Gibbes adds \" I think it quite\nunlikely that any mention of Mrs Horley's death would have appeared in\nthe Irish Edition of the Sunday Dispatch. She had no connection with\nEire as far as I know . . . .the Eire edition deals only with what is likely to\ninterest the Irish \".\nThe London office of the Sunday Dispatch states that it cannot trace\nany reference to Mrs Horley's death in their Irish Edition of the time in\nquestion.\nThe communications received through Miss Cummins go beyond her\nnormal conscious knowledge, as set out in her answers, in several partic-\n\f130 Journal of Society for Psychical Research may 1945\nulars, and are presented in a dramatic setting which Miss Gibbes describes\nas highly characteristic of all the parties concerned, some of them not\npersonally known to Miss Cummins, and as reproducing accurately the\npsychological situation between them. The appropriateness of the manner\nof presentation is, she points out, illustrated by such small mistakes as the\nmis-spelling of the name Horley, suggestive of the kind of error made\nwhen unfamiliar names are taken down from dictation, and the error as to\nthe number of Miss Gibbes's house, an address much better known to the\nautomatist than to the communicator.\nIn all cases where a medium has, or has had, some link with the com-\nmunicator such as Miss Cummins had with Mrs Horley through Miss\nGibbes and Hilda, the question of the extent of the medium's cryptomnesic\nknowledge raises difficulties. Nobody can say with certainty what they\nhave or have not been told about their friends' friends : they can only be\ncertain as to what they remember. But cryptomnesia will not account for\nthe statements in Miss Cummins's communications, from Nigel's message\nof the 8th January 1944 on, as to Mrs Horley 's death, since this was of\nquite recent occurrence (December 1943). Telepathy between Miss\nGibbes and Miss Cummins is not, of course, ruled out, and may have been\nassisted by subconscious inference on Miss Cummins 's part from the terms\nof Miss Gibbes's letter of the 21st December 1943.\nBut telepathy from Miss Gibbes will not account for the names Pole and\nDraper which meant nothing to her in connection with Mrs Horley.\nCORRESPONDENCE\nSir,\u2014As a matter of general interest, not to say historical justice, I should\nlike to put on record the fact that my Association Theory of Telepathy^\nappears to have been anticipated, in outline at least, no less than some\nthirty years ago.\nI have before me an unpublished paper, written in 19 14- 15 by Mrs\nHugh Lewis, discussing the ideas put forward by Maeterlinck in his book\nTlie Unseen Guest. In this she adopts the hypothesis of what we should\nnow call a Common Subconscious, or Universal Mind, or the like, of\nvirtually unlimited knowledge and powers, with which the individual\nfinite mind may somehow or other '\nmake contact '. There is nothing\nvery remarkable or novel in this ; but the author goes on to point out\nthat such a contact might be liable to \" overwhelm the finite mind with an\naccess of knowledge too vast for it to grasp \"\n\u2014i.e. she clearly realises the\nneed for some selective mechanism enabling the individual mind to pick\nout the relevant items\u2014and goes on \" would not the psychological law of\nthe Association of Ideas continue to operate in these subconscious realms\nand save the situation . . .\n\". This is pretty well the essence of the whole\nmatter, so far as I am concerned, though I should rather develop the\nnotion of a Common Subconscious from the facts of Telepathy, etc., than\npostulate it to begin with.\n^ Cf. Proc. S.P.R. Part 168, July 1944, or my book Telepathy recently\npublished.\n\fMAY 1945 Correspondence\nDealing with phantasms and the like, Mrs Lewis writes \" We may take\nas an example of the point of contact some such simple idea as the percep-\ntion of the room or place in which the individual is at the time. Immedi-\nately the contact is made his idea of the room becomes enlarged by some\naddition from the Infinite Consciousness. This addition may be borrowed\nfrom the past or the future. . . . Thus the individual may become sud-\ndenly conscious of some scene formerly enacted in that spot, or he may\nhave a prophetic vision of events that are to come \". Compare my own\nattempts to deal with Apparitions.\nShe even goes so far, also, as to envisage (in her own terms, of course)\nthe role I have assigned to '\nK-objects '\nin psychometry. Referring to\nthe case of \" the medium Madame M. who ascertained the fate of an old\ngentleman . . . and discovered his dead body by handling ... a scarf which\nhe used to wear \" she says \" Here the point of contact was the idea of the\nscarf, and when communication was established between the mind of the\nmedium and the Infinite Consciousness, the medium was able to describe\nin detail the appearance of the old man . . . and the actual position of his\ndead body \".\nI should not have put it quite like that myself, because I am a little shy\nof using words like '\ninfinite ', but the anticipation, in all essentials, of the\nsuggestions I have recently put forward is most remarkable.\nI should like to express my gratitude to Mrs Lewis for bringing this\npaper to my notice.\nI am, Sir etc., Whately Carington\nThe Goligher Circle\nSir,\u2014At the recent discussion group I was asked, if I could give any\ninformation as to what happened to the medium and whether she retained\nher powers. In reply I gave some information which I now find to be\nincorrect. I should be glad therefore if you would publish the true facts\nwhich may be of interest to our members.\nMiss Goligher married a Mr S. G. Donaldson and owing to her experiences\nwith Dr Fournier d'Albe refused to sit any longer. Mr F. McCarthy\nStephenson always kept in touch with her and eventually through the good\noffices of her husband she was persuaded to sit to be photographed by\nmeans of infra red rays. The results may be seen in Psvchic Science\nfor July 1933, January 1936 and July 1936. The first article is by her\nhusband and gives a full description of the apparatus and controls used.\nThe other two are by Mr Stephenson. In the January 1936 article it is\nstated that two lady doctors were present \" who searched Mrs Donaldson \".\nIn regard to the photographs taken by Dr. Crawford it appears from the\nextracts from his diary published in Dr Fournier d'Albe's book that when\nsome at least were taken Miss Goligher came alone to Dr Crawford's\nhouse, was examined by a lady doctor, then dressed in the presence of\nladies before being photographed.\nI might add that the real cause of the breakdown of the Fournier\nd'Albe's experiments as alleged from the medium's side has never been\npublished. It might be a good thing if this was placed on record but not\nfor publication for some years yet.\n\f132 Journal of Society for Psychical Research may 1945\nSome of our members who are interested in psychical research would\nfind a perusal of the earlier numbers of Psychic Science of great interest.\nThey will be found to contain much of value. For instance, in the issue\nfor April 1934 there are copies of four of the original photographs of\n\" Katie King \" taken by Sir William Crookes. A careful examination of\nthem will alone go far to convince anyone of the reality of Sir William\nCrookes' experiences.\nYours faithfully, B. Abdy Collins\n.Sir, \u2014In the light of the recent experiments of Dr S. G. Soal and Mrs\nGoldney, it has occurred to me that an explanation might be found for\nRhine's \" Terminal Salience \". It arises as follows.\nOne would expect any percipient to cognise a mixture of direct and dis-\nplaced hits, though the proportions of each might differ from percipient\nto percipient. If the percipient is making a displaced \" true cognition \",\nit debars him from making a direct \" true cognition \" (as distinct from a\nhit) and vice versa. Thus a high percentage of displaced cognitions reduces\nthe percentage of direct cognitions ; if by some means the displaced cog-\nnitions can be avoided, one would expect a higher direct score.\nThis occurs at the beginning and end of a \" run \" of card guessing. For\nat the beginning it is impossible for the percipient to score a retrocognitive\nhit (without going back to the previous run) and at the end it is impossible\nfor him to score a precognitive hit. Thus the number of displaced hits\nwill be reduced at the beginning and end of a run, and the number of direct\nhits will accordingly rise. This effect is precisely the effect noticed by\nRhine which he calls the \" Terminal Salience \".\nYours sincerely,\nR. Wilson.\nNOTE\nExcept during holidays, the rooms of the Society will as from June 7th\nbe open every Thursday evening from 6.30 to 8 p.m.\nTHE JOURNAL IS PRINTED FOR PRIVATE\nCIRCULATION\nThe attention of Members and Associates is drawn to the private nature\nof the Journal, from which no quotations should be made without the\nprevious consent of the Council.

SIR OLIVER LODGE\nComments thereon by C. Drayton Thomas, the sitter.\nWhen tlie communicator is a person we have l^nown, we receive his\nmessages with a certain amount of respect, though we always have to\nallow for possible or probable sophistication by the channel through\nwhich they . come. A landscape seen through coloured or imperfect\nglass may be changed and distorted, and yet it is something like reality.\n(Sir Oliver Lodge in Phantom Walls, p. 184.)\nDuring a sitting with Mrs. Osborne Leonard on April 20th, 1944, 1\nreceived a long communication. It was said to be given by Sir Oliver\nLodge. Having submitted it to several experts I am encouraged by their\nadvice to offer it for consideration by members of the S.P.R. From any\npoint of view it has interest for psychical research. It began as follows :\nFeda : Here is somebody who wants to talk to you, somebody Feda\nknows, and has been waiting to talk to vou. Do vou know who it is?\nIt's S 'Oliver.\nC.D.T. : He is most welcome.\nFeda : He says, I wanted to come before, but I felt it was not worth\nwhile until I had progressed. in soxne of my studies and arrived at\ncertain conclusions.\nC.D.T. : I shall be most interested to hear them.\nFeda : He thinks that there is nothing very remarkable in them, but\nperhaps coming from me, he says, it may interest you and carry a\ncertain amount of weight.\nThen came messages for his family, including the following, which is\nquoted on account of the comment by Mr. Brodie Lodge.\nFeda : Will you tell Brodie ... I would like to tell his wife that she\nwas perfectly correct when she thought that I was standing beside\nher. She thought that she felt me there and that I was impressing\nher, not about any speciiic thing but in a general way. . . . She was\nvery much aware of me, and I would like her to know that she did not\nimagine that I was there. It was some time recently and was in the\ndaytime, quite recently. She had been, or was, in the garden. I\nhave an impression that I sensed at the time plants and I think she\nwas examining or taking some special interest in plants at the time.\nMr. Brodie Lodge writes : \"So much is known to Mrs. Leonard\nabout the family that the best evidence in these messages is about my\nwife who recollects very well the episode in the garden and her sensations\non that occasion. She was weeding hard and very conscious at the time\nof my father's personality and power. That was one day last week.\"\nTo those who, after reading the following discourse, incline to attribute\nit in essence to Sir Oliverj it will have value as embodying his experience,\n\fJUNE, 1945 A Discourse 135\nand some of his conclusions arrived at after several years in the Beyond.\nTo those who are not convinced, it will present one more example of the\nproblem facing us in such trance communications.\nI notice that it reproduces several of Sir Oliver's beliefs and opinions\nas recorded in his published books. This has a bearing on the question of\nthe communicator's identity, and I have therefore quoted a few passages,\nplacing them next the paragraphs to which they relate. Limitation of\nspace has necessitated omission of some less important passages in the\ncommunication.\nFeda : He wanted you to know that now he has gone back a consider-\nable number of years, and that he found no difficulty in so doing, he\ncalls it, so doing. He says, I think you might say that I have knocked\noff, he calls it, knocked off, about thirty to thirty-five years.\nC.D.T. : How very pleasant !\nFeda : And the process of\u2014what did you call it? Rejuvenation?\nThe processes of rejuvenation have been very easy. I don't think\nthey are to all people, but they have been very easy to me.\nC.D.T. : Were they done voluntarily or automatically?\nFeda : They seemed to me, in my own case, to be more automatic than\nvoluntary. It is on that subject that I wanted to speak to you to-day.\nYou have brought up the question of voluntary versus automatic.\nNow this body, this body in which one finds oneself after death\u2014huh !\n\u2014this body is indeed a body. It seems to be very much more a body,\na material body, than I had supposed would be possible. The status,\nhe says, the make-up, let us call it, of this body seems to be ready-\nmade ; that is, you see, we have made it during our earth-life ; and\nI feel that there is a considerable difference in the content or make-up\nof each body. I see greatly\n\u2014\nWhat did you call it? Something, I've missed something some-\nwhere ; I'm sorry.\nWell, he says, I see great differences, you can put it so, Feda ; I\nsee great differences in the grades and qualities of different indi-\nviduals on this plane.\nWait a minute. On passing, what? I would say that the condition\nof\u2014now I am going to call it the spirit-body. I am going to call it\nthe spirit-body ; I am not going to call it the etheric body or the\nastral body ; I am going to call it the spirit-body. I would say that\nthe condition of the spirit body is governed voluntarily during the\nearth life and automatically after passing. The process seems beyond\nour control now. This is a big, a very big subject, Thomas. It is\nvery important, I feel, and I hope I can get something through to\nyou about it. The process is more automatic after death than it is\nduring what we call life on the earth. It is more within our power to\nbend, to shape, to govern that spirit-body during our earth lives than\nit is after. That is why it behoves us to have some knowledge, some\nworking knowledge, even of a simple and elementary kind, about\nthese matters. We do make, we create in a way, the quality, the\nstrength, the power of our spirit-body during our earth lives. We\npass into it, the body that we have made, and it is there, and, believe\n\f136 Jourtial of Society for Psychical Research JUNE, 1945\nme, it is more difficult to shape it and alter it after than it is during\nthe earth life.\nSpirit Body\nThe following quotation is from Sir Oliver's paper in S.P.R. Proc. for\nJune, 1929 :\nMy doctrine at present is that this transcendental, immaterial entity\nneeds and always will need something physical\u2014physical, not neces-\nsarily material\u2014for its manifestation, that it never is really without a\n\" body \", even though it be discarnate. The mechanism of flesh which\nwas utilised here was indeed temporary, but that was never its primary\nmechanism. The primary physical mechanism associated with spirit\nis not gross matter, spirit can only interact with matter under difficulties\nfor a time ; its real permanent existence is in the freedom of space, with\nan etherial mechanism, whose properties do not appeal to the senses,\nand therefore are at present beyond our ken. (p. 499.)\nOn the hypothesis that we can ever enter into communication with\nthose in that order of existence, we ought to learn from them something\nof what it is like. I consider that we have learnt something, not very\nmuch, but sufficient to carry on with. I do not expect to be much\nsurprised when I get there. So far as it goes, the testimony is in favour\nof a still continuing full-bodied existence, not indeed of matter, but of\nsomething else which, though it does not appeal to our present senses,\nis otherwise equally real, equally substantial ; freer and less hampered,\nit seems to be, but not revolutionarily different. We appear to remain\nourselves, and the conditions around us are of somewhat the same\norder, (p. 503.)\nFeda : Now I feel that what I am saying and what I may say to you on\ndifferent occasions may arouse a certain amount of controversy\n\u2014\ncontroversy (D.V.) but I must give you my impressions, my deduc-\ntions, the result of my observations, as they have come to me.\nAnd this opportunity, for which I have been waiting a considerable\ntime\u2014well, I have delayed making it so that I could be sure to my\nown satisfaction that I am giving you the correct deductions, that I\nam giving you facts founded on the observations I have made since\nmy transition.\nI think I've got his words. Perhaps I missed a few, because he\ngives a sign, and that means Go on, but I think I missed something.\nHe says, Feda, if you miss a word or two, if you use the particular\nvernacular idiom understood by your medium, automatically, auto-\nmatically what? Something, I don't know what that word is\u2014auto-\nmatically something by your medium, it doesn't matter so long as\nyou get my ideas and as many words as you can of mine. That will\nsuffice. That's what he says.\nIn the above passage, where italics are used followed by the letters D.V.\nin brackets, it should be understood that the italicised word was spoken\nin the direct voice. It was clearly heard in a strong whisper, which sounded\nas if originating from a little distance in front of the medium. We shall\n\fJUNE, 1945 A Discourse 137\nmeet this again later. Whether this direct vocaHsation is caused by, what\nmight be termed, a sudden gust of psychic force, or whether it is due to a\ndesire for special emphasis, is uncertain. Often it would seem to mark\nspecial emphasis, at other times a wish to help Feda over a difficulty in\n\" hearing \", but occasionally it is undoubtedly useful in correcting an\nerror in transmission. Some communicators produce it more frequently\nthan do others, and the same communicator will produce it more often at\none sitting than at another sitting. Feda usually repeats the word, or\nwords, as if quite unaware that they have been heard by me. I have\nknown her to miss it and to proceed as if the words in direct voice had\nnot been spoken. There is an interesting reference to this phenomenon\nin jMr Kenneth Richmond's article on Leonard material in S.P.R. Proc.\nfor May 1936.\nSir Oliver was, of course, well aware of the difficulties of communica-\ntion. Speaking of the best professional mediums, he writes :\nThe element of sophistication, from the knowledge or mental deposit\nof the medium, is here reduced to a minimum, at least when the trance\nis strong and the conditions good ; that is, quiet, peaceful and un-\nperturbed. But even so the brain of the medium has to be employed ;\nthe limitations of its capacity are therefore apparent ; its habits or usual\nchannels, or brain deposits, have to be utilised or selected from ; and\nonly by special effort can intelligence be got through of a kind quite\nbeyond the medium's normal brain capacity.\n\u2014\n{Phantom Walls, p. 154.)\nFeda : Now, during the earth life I kept an open mind about this vexed\nquestion of what is called reincarnation. I kept an open mind about\nif. I didn't know, I didn't know. How could I know? I had no\nmemory of previous lives. As far as I remember I was not told\nanything very definite about them as to whether I had, or had not,\nhad any. But my wife had certain experiences and certain communi-\ncations, I believe, a great many years ago, which interested her : but\nI let them be. There were other problems, questions of a vital\ncharacter, that needed my attention. I let it be till I knew. Well,\nnow I know that it is a fact. It is true, therefore I must state it as\ntrue, that, according to my personal experience, it is true ; and I\nhave had many talks with my friend Myers about it. I have asked\nhim why he did not tell me more about it, especially during my many\nsittings with Feda. He said that he thought that at times the medium\nhad had an aversion to the idea. I think that has made a certain\nbarrier, and possibly also she was acting in what I might call a con-\nscientious sense about it, and was anxious that I should get what she\nfelt was right and founded on what she calls fact. She was uncertain\nabout it herself, thought there was a certain amount of imagination\nand what she calls rubbish talked about it, and I think that that built\nup a barrier.\nIt is interesting to compare the foregoing with what Lodge wrote on\nthe subject :\n\u2014\nAs regards reincarnation, it is probably a mistake to suppose that\nthe same individual whom we knew in bodily form is likelv to appear\n\f138 Journal of Society for Psychical Research june, 1945\nagain, at some future date. There may be exceptions, but as a rule that\nseems unlikely to happen. What may happen, however, is that some\nother portion of the larger self becomes incarnate.\n\u2014\n{The Making of\nMan, p. 170.) -\nMy message is that there is some great truth in the idea of pre-\nexistence\u2014not the obvious truth, nor one easy to formulate\u2014a truth\ndifficult to express, not to be identified with the guesses of reincarnation\nand transmigration, which may be fanciful. We may not have been\nindividuals before, but we are chips or fragments of a great m.ass of\nmind, of spirit and of life\u2014drops, as it were, taken out of a germinal\nreservoir of life, and incubated until incarnate in a material bodv. . . .\n\"What happened before earth-life we have forgotten ; if we ever knew,\nwe have forgotten. Our individual memory begins soon after birth.\nBefore that we cannot trace identity. Perhaps we had none. Either we\nhad none or we have forgotten.\n\u2014\n(Reason and Belief, pp. 19, 28.)\nIt is this earth-life that has been the strange and exceptional thing.\nThe wonder is that we ever succeeded in entering a matter body at all.\nMany fail. . . . But it may be said of that viev\/. If that is so it seems to\nrequire a kind of pre-existence, an admission that we existed in the\ninvisible world, in the ether or in space, and then condensed on to\nmatter and moved about here for a time and then went back whence we\ncame. Well, in a sense that is my view ; but we must discriminate\nbetween life, on the one hand, and individual life, personality, on the\nother. I do not say that the individual has pre-existed. What I liave\nsaid about life in general would apply to every kind of life, animal and\nplant life also. No kind of life has been explained in terms of matter.\nBut most living things have no personality. When the question of pre-\nexistence arises I should say that the individual as we know him is a\nfresh apparition, a new individualisation of something pre-existing. . . .\nMy view thus is that this individual self did not pre-exist, but formed\nits character while in association with matter during this present epoch,\nthis particular episode, of earth-life ; and that then it rejoins its larger\nself, its pristine permanent reality, taking with it its developed character,\nbut having shaken off the dust of the earth.\n\u2014\n{Phantom Walls, p. 96.)\nFeda : Well, now, he says, this body, this spirit body, is unable to\nadapt itself completely, in complete harmony, complete unity, and\ntherefore happily with the conditions of this side until it is perfected,\nlet us call it, to a certain extent, until it has had certain experiences\nand benefitted by them, benefitted. And, believe me, these experi-\nences have to be all round. They have to be varied, and I think\nthat there are few people who can get the sufficiently varied experi-\nences and tests in one incarnation that will enable them to stay per-\nmanently on this side. They have to come back until the spirit body\nis built up, built up. In other words, this body has to be made, it\nhas got to be created. The spirit is there, but the spirit body has to\nbe made like the garment clothing the spirit. And this garment\ntakes a long time in the rnzking, a long time. They tell me it is\nextremelv difficult to adjust oneself to the conditions on this side.\nPeople can say what they like, but it is an extremely difficult task to\n\fJUNE, 1945 A Discourse 139\nadjust oneself perfectly to the conditions on this side : that is to say,\nif j-ou are going to use your powers to their full extent, if you are\ngoing to avail yourself of the opportunities that are there. Now I\nwould say that the average individual is only able to avail himself of\nninety per cent, of the opportunities that should be open to him.\nC.D.T. : Ninety per cent? Ninety?\nFeda : Is that what you said? Not able {J}. Y.) The average individual\nis not able to avail himself\u2014I've got something wrong.\nC.D.T. : He cannot avail himself of ninety per cent. He only avails\nhimself of ten per cent.\nDirect Voice : Ten per cent.\nC.D.T. : Thank you. That is clear.\nFeda : And of course should he live such a life\u2014that is to say, a ten\nper cent, life, let us call it, he stagnates. You cannot stagnate on\nthis side. You can stagnate more easily and com.fortably on the\nearth, but here you would lose identity, and that cannot be allowed.\nYou lose what progress you have made, you lose your ten per cent, if\nyou stay too long in that status of stagnation that you would un-\ndoubtedly fall into, drift into, without the weapons on which to sharpen\nyour spiritual faculties. Thomas, do you see? You haven't the\nweapons here. You haven't the machinery here. You have got to\ngo back to the earth to have them at your command again. You must.\nYou get a certain amount of help on this side, but nothing is done for\nyou that you must do and should do for yourself. Your father tells\nme he has always made that plain to you. Admiral idea, he says\nAdmirable (D.V.). An admirable idea, to make that clear to you.\n\" The weapons, the machinery \". Compare with the following :\nEvidently the episode of earth-life is of importance ; we can surmise\nthat the difficulties we encounter in Matter, the troubles caused by our\nanimal ancestry, and all the struggle and effort which is here necessary,\neven for maintenance, have a training and disciplining effect ;\nstrength-\nening our character, sifting the wheat from the tares, and constituting\nan experience of the utmost value for the future stages of our develop-\nment.\n\u2014\n{Making of Man, p. 33.)\nAlso the following from Why I Believe in Personal Immortality :\nTerrestrial incarnation is of value, and we can partly see why. The\nindividual appears to us through his bodily manifestation, and common\nexperience shows that an individual is thus to a great extent isolated\nfrom his fellows, and has in any case to live his own life and develop his\nown character as best he can ; at the same time encountering others in\nlike case and having an opportunity of making friends. The material\nbody is a psychic screen, but a physical uniter : we encounter people\n\u2014\nin the street, so to speak\u2014whom we should never otherwise have met.\nThrough our bodily mechanism we can learn about historical characters\nand even about those who only live in literature. The body is a fine\ninstrument for education, (p. 29.)\nThe difficulties met with are part of the soul's training ; the value of\nthe individual character depends on the success with which the special\n\f140 Journal of Society for Psycliical ResearcJi june, 1945\nconditions are utilized, and the wisdom with which they are employed.\nThe episode of earth life is therefore of great value in developing char-\nacter, in enlarging knowledge, in cultivating new friendships, and\ngenerally adding to the richness of life. --(p. 30.)\nFeda : But when it comes to the point, when it is seen that this person\nmust come back, help is given. In other words, his education is taken\nin hand hy those who are competent to deal with him, and he is told,\nas a child would be told, in what way he has to learn certain lessons\nand what other lessons there are in which he has failed, or which he\nmust learn, and which he must go back into the school of life to learn.\nThe testing ground, the school, as Myers always called it to me in\ncommunications with him, the school, the testing ground, the earth.\nAnd with that amount of understanding which is alive in him he can\nuse it ; he can use it because he is aware that others are doing things\nhe cannot do. He is aware of it. lie looks up and he sees those who\nhave, let us say, grown wings, those who can soar, those who can\nhave adventures and experiences of a rem.arkably interesting kind\nfrom which he is debarred. He feels weighted. Now that embraces\nit all to me. He knows there is something wrong, and he usually\nacquiesces in the suggestion that he should volunteer' to go back.\nAnd, if he is willing, he has the advantage of being taught and pre-\npared to a certain extent for his next experience. He is taken in\nhand, and he is instructed in the things in which he is lacking. At\nleast he is told what they are, broadly speaking, broadly speaking, and\nhe is told that these same instructors, teachers, will watch over him\nwhen he comes back to the earth, and that, if he should be willing\nand attain a sense of unity with them, believe in them, with which he\nis sent back to the earth, with which every human being is sent back\nto the earth, the knowledge of the spiritual embedded in his con-\nsciousness, embedded there, which is in us all. It is in us all\u2014we\ncan turn it out and refuse to admit it, but it is there, as you know\n\u2014\nhe is told that if he will react to that he will find himself in touch\nwith these same leaders. He will probably be introduced to them\nshould he have the good fortune, or the misfortune (he's looking\nnaughty !) to become interested in psychic research. He will most\nprobably have them introduced to him as the Guides. I i^emember\nhearing far too much about the Guides at several of my earlier sittings.\nIn fact, I was rather bored with the Guides. But now I understand,\nI understand ; I have met them and I have recognised them as old-\ntime friends, friends from a very long time ago, and I appreciate, I\ndeeply appreciate, their faithfulness and their patience with me.\nSir Oliver wrote :\nWe also experience\u2014whether we recognise it or not\u2014the guidance\nand help we are vouchsafed during our incarnation ... It is contended\nthat we cannot admit of interference from another world : that we\ncannot allow for assistance by higher beings. The conservation of energy\nhas been supposed to prevent that. I reply, No, for it doesn't prevent\nus from helping each other, or from helping the lower animals.\n\u2014\n(Phantom Walls, p. loi.)\n\fJUNE, 1945 A Discourse 141\nThey tell us from the other side that they follow our progress with\nkeen interest, and are ahvays ready to help, when we are willing to\nreceive help : not only ready, but able ;\nthough, of course, their\npowers are limited, and, like us, they can but do the best that is possible\nunder the circumstances.\n\u2014\n{71ie Making of Man, p. 33.)\nFeda : In the hearts of men? What's he trying to sav? In the hearts\nof men. I don't know what it is ; is he saying some poetry.' He said\nsomething about something\u2014I'm going back for a moment to what\nI told you\u2014with that instinct for understanding, for keeping hold of\nthe spiritual, that is in us, but is knocked out of us, beaten out of us\nby misguided people, by a misguided system of education ; but it is\nthere in us. He says, I was thinking of something that I remember,\nsomething I was fond of at one time, and the line\u2014I can't get this\nword\u2014something in the hearts of men\u2014\" It is an attribute of God\nHimself \". It's something in the hearts of men which is an attribute\nof God Himself, he says, like that ; it's a long word ;\nperhaps he will\nbe able to say it by itself after. It's enshrined, in it. It's enthroned\nin it. The poem had it \" in the hearts of men \", and I say it is there\nin the heart of man, the soul of him, which the soul has inherited\nfrom the spirit in its first birth.\nThe attempted quotation evidently refers to the lines on Mercy, in\nThe Alerchaut of Venice, Act iv, Sc. i :\n\" It is enthroned in the hearts of kings.\nIt is an attribute to God Himself \".\nThe above, much blurred in transmission, centres round the thought\nthat man has ability to respond to spiritual impulses, and that this ability,\ndeep seated in his being, is God-given.\nFeda : Now there is nothing whatever, as far as I can see, in the facts\nregarding physical incarnation and the ordinary processes of physical\nevolution as science has understood them, there is nothing that need\ncontradict the foregoing. The physical processes by which man has\nevolved are not interfered with. He evolved, he reached a certain\nstage before he began to reincarnate. I feel the time will come when\nscience will embrace so much more of what we have called the meta-\nphysical\u2014Is that right? When science will find itself incomplete\nwithout a union with metaphysical truths, metaphysical knowledge.\nIt must be so. There must be a true science of spirit, mind and phy-\nsical. We cannot separate them ; not one of the three can do without\nthe others. That has been our trouble, Thomas. It has been our\ntrouble. We have tried to monopolise one and concentrate on one\nand cut off the other two. Usually w'e allow the two, the physical\nand the mental. We cut out the third, the spiritual, for the purpose\nof what we call scientific investigation and scientific truth. It cannot\nbe done. It is not complete. Even those who are convinced that\nthey are right in doing so much see that there are certain conditions,\ncertain facts, that evade them, certain questions, certain problems\nthey cannot resolve. While they limit themselves to these two the\nprocesses of life cannot be solved in their entirety. We may evolve\n\f142 Joiinial of Society for.Psychical Research JUNE, 1945\ncertain short-lived automatic orocesses, but we have not that eternal\nmemory, that immortal process of life which comes from God. We\ncannot harness that. We cannot as as . We cannot what?\nOh, I can't get that word, S'Oliver. Well, try it another way, Feda.\nWe cannot make it our own, we cannot bring it down into the grossly\nmaterial and divorce it from the spiritual, from its spiritual origin.\nWe miust learn the laws, the spiritual laws, the Divine laws, and co-\noperate with them. Then there will be more hope for us ; there will\nbe a greater perfection in whatever we do or try to do with regard to\nthe other two.\nThe above was undoubtedly one of Lodge's convictions and may be\nfound in his writings, among others in S.P.R. Proc, June 1929 :\nThe whole of nature might be likened to an organism of which we\nstudy the functions. On this view, the vital thing is not the structure\nbut the function. An organism guides and controls its own workings ;\nit operates on and uses matter, and in that guidance the secret lies.\nThe working of the whole is analogous to the working of our own bodies\ncontrolled by an animating principle which may be called soul or spirit.\nBut such terms seem alien to present-day science.\u2014(P. 496.)\nFinal causes may be the business of philosophy and religion, but not\nof science ; there we are seeking, as far as we can, the physical, the\nchemical, the mechanical explanation. Those aspects are truly part of\nthe whole ; the only mistake is for those who so successfully and de-\nvotedly study material things to think that they are all, that they are\nfinal, and to exclude or deny all the others.\n\u2014\n{Phantom Walls, p. 85.)\nEverything excluded is weakness. To exclude the Ether is a terrible\nweakness : an effort to understand the connection between mind and\nmatter is hopeless if we exclude the tei tium quid, the essential intermed-\niary. To exclude life and mind is another weakness : it is the basis\nof a materialistic system.\n\u2014\n{Ether and Reality, p. 20.)\nFeda : I am glad\u2014if I may be allowed to be personal\u2014I have every\nreason to be extremely thankful that 1 allowed myself to be led from\nthe material through the mental to the spiritual. I know there were\nthose who railed at me, thought I had a bee in my bonnet and so\nforth, but, he says, I had a firm conviction that there was a Being,\nan intelligent and benef Beneficent (D.V.) beneficent Being\nabove and beyond and in all things, and that we could not do without\nHim, and that if there were things in which we felt we did not want\nHim those things were not good. I wanted to let them alone. But\nif there were things in which I felt He could co-operate or would\nwish to co-operate, I felt eager to do those things. I kept God in my\nlife and in my plans and in my ideas, and I have every reason to be\nthankful that I did so. It gave me\u2014if I may put it so at the risk of\nsounding somewhat self-complacent\u2014it gave me a great advantage\nin my personal conditions, and in my ability to do that which I felt\n-- inclined to do and wished to do ; a greater interest in the life into\nwhich I had recently come, a greater ability to enjoy the companion-\nship of others who had been here longer than I, a greater zest for\n\fJUNE, 1945 A Discourse 143\nliving ;\nmy faculties seemed remarkably keen and clear. I contrast\nmy condition with the conditions of some people, people who have\nlived a long life on the earth, people who have attained a certain\namount of\u2014eminence\u2014What did you call it? Eminence (D.V.)\u2014\n\u2022\nin their professions or their work, their lives generally, yet who come\nover here and seem at such a disadvantage, who come over here and\nhave to crawl, virtuall}^ crawl, whereas one can oneself walk and run\nand leap. I was overcome with the joy of life : and I see those others,\npoor creatures ! coming over from what they would call material\nsuccess on the earth and feeling, well 1 at a great disadvantage, at a\ngreat disadvantage. And those are the people, the only people, who\nv\/ish to return to the earth. I don't like to stress the fact of my joy,\nmy feeling of satisfaction that I had allowed myself to be guided in my\nnatural inclinations towards, shall I say? spiritual knowledge, spiritual\nthought, that I had allowed myself to be guided to, that knowledge\nwhich was augmented by my friend Myers and others while I was on\nthe earth. I felt the deepest satisfaction that I had done so, the\ndeepest satisfaction.\nNo reader of Lodge's books can fail to realise that he was a sincerely\nreligious man.\nFeda : Now this body, to come back to this body, this spirit body.\nThe earth body we know. The earth body is a covering made up of\ncertain constituents. We know so much, so much, so much. We\nknow it is composed of certain chemical, chemical something\u2014\nI\ncan't get it. Never mind. I must say what I can. They are held\ntogether by certain processes and dependent to some extent on the\nsubstance called the ether, and that this body, this physical body,\nhas only a temporary existence in the nature of things ; as we under-\nstand them at present it can only have a temporary existence. The\nwill of man can only help him to live, the understanding can only\nhelp him to live, no matter what it is, a certain number of years, a\ncertain number of years, more or less, more than another man, more\nthan his next-door neighbour or less than his next-door neighbour,\naccording to his habits and so forth. But this other body, this spirit\nbody, it is within the power and the will of man to create and to\nshape so that it will have immortal and eternal existence after the\ndeath of the physical, after man has made it sufficiently harmonious\nto its spiritual conditions and surroundings, that is to say, those into\nwhich it will enter after death. If he is able to do that, it is not in-\ncumbent upon him to enter into another physical body at some later\nperiod and go through the same processes. It is not necessary. But\nmost people find it necessary. Some at a very low ebb, you might\ncall it a low ebb, are compelled to come back\u2014at least, I don't want\nto say that word compelled, but they come back automatically. When\nI say compelled I think I mean there is no choice in the matter. They\nhave to go back. They are drawn back. It is the spirit within them\nknows it must go back. There is an attraction for it to the earth to\ncontinue its progress or attempt at progress. There is always that\nthat we call, for want of a better term, the Divine Spark, the Divine\n\f144 your7ial of Society for Psychical Research june, 1945\nSpark, that animates us automatically. We may commit crimes, we\nmay sink into a slough of ignorance, and we may think there is no\nhope for us, we have got beyond hope. But the Divine Spark within\nus is alive, we cannot kill it. We can suppress it and keep it down,\nwe can damp it so much we are scarcely aware of it, but it is there,\nand it is, as I say, alive, and that which is alive animates, as you\nknow. It has the extrem.e\u2014let me call it extreme for want of another\nterm\u2014the extreme of energy within itself. It is Energy, Divine\nEnergy. Small as it is, buried as it is, it is bursting with Divine\nEnergy, the need to express itself. Feda will remember that I used\nto say, and your father has often talked to me about it, that human\nbeings were bits struck off the Rock of Life, the Rock of Life, and\nthat some God might w.ish to be struck off, and some were struck off\nwantonly, but they had become human individual egos and the\nDivine Spark therefore enthroned in each piece that was struck off\nthe Rock of Life. You can't strike a piece off, chip a piece off the\nRock of Life but it has to be animated ; the animation is there, in\nevery infinitesimal piece that you strike off. He used to talk sometimes\nto LIncle Fred (i.e. Myers) about the Rock of Life and the unwanted\nchild. Yes, he says, the unnecessary life, and unnecessary increase\nof life on the earth. You see what I mean.?\nC.D.T. : Oh yes, quite ; I do.\nFeda : The congestion of the undesirable is opposed to the perfecting\nof the material which is already there in its process of evolution.\nWell, this Spark ; it is this Spark which is always calling men ^back\nto God, back to the Rock, back to that from which it has sprung. It\nis always in\u2014what ? Something man : inciting, is that right?\nC.D.T. : I think it is.\nFeda : Inciting man to do this or that or the other that they may bring\nhis efforts in train, in harmony with that Divine Source from which\nit springs. And it does it. He says, probably that is the good angel\nwho tapped on one's shoulder, you know. It probably is. Or the\ngood angel, or saint, is symbolised in that form.\nDivine Spark : the idea is, of course, familiar. It was one of Lodge's\nfundamental beliefs.\nWe have an animal body, and have many difficulties associated with\nit, but we have a divine spark which is something from the other region,\nbrought into this transitory field of existence.\n\u2014\n{Phantom Walls, p. 105.)\nSo we are led to apprehend Wordsworth's immortal poem in a livelier\nway, as not only poetically true, but as an inspired expression of actual\nfact :\n\" Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting ;\nThe soul that rises with us, our life's star.\nHath had elsewhere its setting.\nAnd cometh from' afar :\nNot in entire fo'rgetfulness\nAnd not in utter nakedness,\nBut trailing clouds of glory do we come\nFrom God Who is our home.\"\n\fJUNE, 1945 A Discourse 145\nYes, fragments of the Great Spirit wiiich is God. This has gradually\ndawned upon us.\n\u2014\n{Reason and Belief, p. 32.)\nFeda : Now this being so it is\u2014it is what? It is something\u2014wait a\nminute\u2014I'll get that in a minute. It's something\u2014I've missed that\n\u2014man will eventually attain to, the state in which he can continue\nhis life, his progress, his evolution on our plane, the plane on which I\nexist now, the plane on which I function now. But it may take him\nsome considerable time, and I think that we could, in modern\nlanguage, speed up the evolution of man if we let him know why he\nmust evolve and the trouble he will save himself if he chooses to\nendeavour to do this. If it is explained to him, Thomas, that these\ntwo bodies are his here and now, here and now, they are in his possess-\nion, they are, you might say, or can be, the servants of his will, the\nclay to the potter\u2014Is that right?\nC.D.T. : Go on ; we shall tell.\nFeda : The clay to the potter, he will know it is worth while endeavour-\ning to take not only himself, as he calls this limited physical body, in\nhand but to take his two selves, as he might call them, in hand and\nperfect them so that he has a second body, his spirit body, ready\nperfect to enter when the time of death comes which is so inevitable.\nIt is inevitable. One cannot escape it. He knows that. But I think\nin present conditions, the conditions of ignorance of this subject, he\nignores death as much as he can. He doesn't embrace the idea and\nexamine it and try to understand its possibilities. He ignores it. It\nspells or seems to spell extinction to him, or something which is so\nvague, so incomprehensible to him that it dismaj's him. Now, if we\ncan take away that fear and show him there is the other body, the\nspirit body, and that it is within his power now to shape it, strengthen\nit, so that he will thoroughly enjoy living in it from the moment in\nwhich his physical body collapses, then I think, Thomas, he will begin\nto see to it, or, shall I say? a considerabty greater number of people will\nsee to it than do at present.\nC.D.T. : One would certainly hope so.\nFeda : He says, I think they will. I think they will. But\u2014but what?\nWait a minute, please. I do wish to emphasise that point, that it is\nwithin man's power not only to create\u2014No, don't let us call it create,\nbut to perfect and shape his spirit body and to become more and\nmore familiar with it as he does so. And I think he gets\u2014I am not\nquite sure but I think, I think, from what I have seen, I think that\nas he becomes familiar with it he may be able to enjoy certain excur-\nsions in it while he is still in his physical, enough to enjoy these\nexcursions, which v\/ill give him an appetite for more and an idea of\nwhat advantages and adventures will be his after death. Now this is\nalso my own thought. I am not sure of this, but a deduction I have\ndrawn, that the more people who are doing these things, who are\nstudying and who are consciously and voluntarily following up the\nstudy of the spirit body and who are therefore able to enjoy a certain\namount of exercise in it, the more, the greater the number, the more\nit will grow. The more it will grow, because I think that these people\n\f146 Journal of Society for Psychical Research JUNE, 1945\nwill meet each other ; one will meet one's neighbours, may I put it?\none will inevitably meet one's neighbours, one's next-door neighbour,\nout of the body and there will be a sense of farhiliarity which will\ngrow until the v\/hole\u2014the whole what? The whole custom, the\nwhole operation, let us call it, custom and operation, the whole\ncustom and operation will become a more familiar thing to us. I\nhave noticed, Thomas, that in those who are able to exercise them-\nselves in the spirit-body while still operating in their earth-bodies,\ntheir physical bodies, that should there be an instance of that kind,\nlike meeting their next-door neighbour who is connected with the\neveryday events of mundane life, an occurrence of that kind repeated\ntwice or three times affects the mind, the consciousness, the ordinary\nconsciousness, and prepared the mind for other occurrences and other\nopportunities and also for accepting them as part of the ordinary\nnormal life.\nC.D.T. : Yes ; that seems clear.\nFeda : When an individual escapes from his physical and visits our\nstate, seeing and meeting en route people he knows, it is more difficult\nfor him to remember (realise?) what he has done, because those\npeople with whom he communicates, with whom he fraternises on\nthe spirit side of life generally seem to him to be part of his normal\neveryday life. We have split up life into two parts far too drastically.\nWe have drawn a line, and we must gradually erase that line. We\nhave talked about the spiritual life and the earth life or the physical\nlife. The two are one and we must make them one again. There is\nno line, there is no line at all. Man has drawn a line and it must be\nerased, and it will take some time to erase it completely, but we must\nwork towards that, the erasing of that man-made line, that man-made\nboundary. We must do that in the same way that we must erase\nshall we call it? national boundaries, national boundaries and limita-\ntions, racial ones. All these must go, and especially the boundary\nthat we have quite unnecessarily erected between what we now call\nour two worlds, which are one. It is only one world. There is only\none world and we must take down these barriers, these barriers of\nillusion that compelled us to think there must be two, because through\nour limitations and ignorance we are unable to look over the self-\nerected barrier, or to look through it. It must come down. It is\nyour work, it is our work, to erase it, to take it down.\nOne world, not two. The meaning of the above is clear and some would\nbe disposed to agree with it. And yet, for the purpose of ordinary speech,\nit is desirable to make a distinction between our mundane life and that of\nthe Great Beyond. I have never felt able to agree with Lodge's, idea that\ndescriptions of the Beyond were actually depicting the ethereal side or\naspect of earthly scenes. That seemed to press unification too far. But\nhow familiar to Lodge was this \" one world \" conception may be seen\nfrom the following extract :\nReally the word \" next \" is inappropriate. There is no \" next\n\"\nworld, save subjectively. The Universe is one : it is not so much a\n\fJUNE, 1945 A Discourse 147\nsequence as a co-existence. What we call \"the next world\" is co-\nexistent and simultaneous with this.\n\u2014\n(The Making of Man, p. 32.)\nFeda : We must make man understand that the spirit body is to a\ncertain extent in his own power, his will power, that he can do as he\npleases with it, that it is even more at his mercy than his physical\n'body is. He has thought of the spirit body, if he thought of it at all,\nas something\u2014What did you call it? Elusive, he calls it, elusive,\nsomething that is beyond him. It is exactly the contrary. He is\nshaping and making that body every hour of his life. He is dealing\nwith it in every action and every thought, far more than he is doing\nwith this physical body. This physical body, being temporary and\nbeing subject to certain inherited tendencies of thought, that can\nelude him. It is not his so much, Thomas, do you see my point?\nThis physical body is not so much his as his spirit body is. His\nphysical body belongs to the physical world. It has inherited, shall\nwe call it? instinctive powers which belong to it more than to the\nspirit body, which, in fact, have nothing whatever to do with the\nspirit body. You might say, if you like to call it so, it has a mind\n\u2014\nOh, dear! That he, What? The physical body\u2014 See if this is right\n\u2014\nhas a mind, that is, it partakes of a great consciousness, of the great\nphysical mind, the great physical consciousness which we call instinct.\nSeparate them if you like and say that the mind, the other mind, the\ngreater consciousness which is always with us, which we take with us\nafter death, is the intuition : the one is the intuition, the other is the\ninstinct. They are both forms of consciousness, but the one of\nwhich I am speaking now,, of which his physical body partakes, has\ncome from the physical and can only last while the physical lasts ;\nbut it is a very strong one. It is very strong, and it has more power\nof its own than man has ever had, while he has complete control and\ncomplete power with\u2014and I will call it over\u2014his spirit body. It is\nthat that we shall have some difficulty in ramming home to him,\nbecause he has thought of it exactly the opposite, as being exactly\nthe opposite. It is wrong teaching, he says ; it is wrong thought.\nHe says. This physical, Thomas, this physical consciousness, this\nphysical instinct is v\/hat is known as evil. Do you see? We talk,\nmany have talked, as you know, philosophers, teachers, thinkers\ngenerally, of the spirits of good and evil. Well, I haven't come across\nany devil yet, or saint either. I haven't come across any embodiment\nof evil, but I look upon the purely physical instinct, or the great\nphysical consciousness, which has existed down the ages as far as the\nhistory of man goes, I look upon that as containing whatever evil\nthere is in the universe, and that the spirit of man, being pure, is\nseparated from it, but that the will of man poised between the two\nstates can be affected by the evil thoughts, the mass-consciousness,\nyou see, of the physical. It is that that is tempting. But that evil\nspirits tempted Him, Satan tempted Him, an evil spirit tempted\nHim\u2014No ! He is merely reacting voluntarily to the spirit of heredity,\nevil in the physical mass-consciousness, or instinct. That's what I\n\u2022\nthink he said. You see, there must be the intelligent desire for pro-\n\f148 Journal of Society for Psychical Research JUNE, 1945\ngress. And there must be the intelligent desire for effort, personal\neffort to attain that progress. Animation, again, and as soon as the will-\npower reacts to that desire, the Spark helps. Now that Spark, he says\n\u2014not a bad term for it, because that Spark can be fanned into a flame ;\nthe will-power is the bellows. The will-power is the bellows that fans\nthe Divine Spark into a flame from something which is so buried, so\nobscured that it is invisible\u2014one cannot believe it is there. But it\ncan be fanned by the bellows of the will-power. The will-power\nis there. I am not sure myself that this something that we call will-\npower, which is possessed by every man and woman living\u2014I am not\nsure it is not an offshoot, a sort of secondary spark from the Divine\nSpark. At any rate it is there, do you see? It is not something that\nman has to attain or to develop ; it is there : but he can develop it\nfurther. He has the nucleus of it. Nothing is beyond man\u2014that is\nmy point. God has not set a standard for man to attain which it is\nnot within his power to attain. Make that clear, Thomas ! Do you\nsee? Make that point clear. Then we shall have less of this hopeless-\nness of attitude and outlook, this \" I can't hope to attain to such per-\nfection\". The truth is that I can attain any perfection that is possible\nto anybody. In other words, I can come back to God. That is to\nsay, I can be as God, I can be Godlike. It is my inheritance. I can\nattain it when I am ready for it. I can attain it when I choose. It is\nin man's power to attain anything that is possible to any other man.\nI want to take away this attitude of limitation from the minds of men.\nI want to make it seem easier to man to attain, and to therefore give\nhim an increased eagerness to do so. Yes, you are right. There must\nbe the intelligence of the soul and spirit, the intelligence, the bright-\nness ; that living quality in the mind there must be. He is not com-\nplete without it. As I see that state of negative goodness, well, it is\nnegative in operation. If things occur to you, he hopes that you will\ntell your father, and your father will then tell him, so that he can come\nagain and elucidate them.\nC.D.T. : Thank you. I shall be very pleased to do so.\nFeda : That is, if it is within my power and my present knowledge.\nYou may ask me something which I shall have to say Wait ; I don't\nknow ; I don't know. I shall be frank with you and I shall tell you.\nCharacteristics of Sir Oliver's Extemporaneous Speaking\nThere is a footnote to the first page of Sir Oliver Lodge's booklet. Rela-\ntivity. It reads, \" Lecture to the Literary and Philosophical Society of\nLiverpool on October 31, 1921, reported by a stenographer from short-\nhand notes taken upon the evening of the address.\" In reading this\nLiverpool Lecture one notices conspicuous points of style. First the\nfrequency of crisp, short sentences standing between others of ordinary\nlength ;\nby a short sentence I mean one of seven words or less ; of these\nthere are eighty-three. Next, one notices a habit of interjecting, in the\nmidst of a longer sentence, a short one which has to be written between\ndashes ; of this there are eleven instances. Then there is the more or less\nunnecessary word, \" Well !\n\" standing at the commencement of a new\n.1\n\fJUNE, 1945 A Discourse 149\nparagraph, or before a summing-up of argument ; and similarly the word,\n\" Now, \". The former appears seven times and the latter ten. The\nassertions, \" I do not know \" or \" We do not know \" are found eight times.\nLet us compare the above with the Lodge-Leonard communication.\nAs the latter is about one-seventb shorter than the Liverpool Lecture, I\nsubtract one-seventh from the latter to make the comparison approxi-\nmately exact. The figures so obtained are.\nShort sentences\nInterjected sentences\n\" Well !\n\"\n\" Now\u2014,\"\n\" Do not know \"\nThis similarity will appear still more significant if compared with\nverbatim reports in the public Press, or in reports of other Leonard\ncommunicators. It looks like something for which chance coincidence\ncannot account. If I am right in this conclusion, we can at least say that\ninternal evidence strongly suggests that this discourse originated in the\nmind of Sir Oliver Lodge.\nThere is one further characteristic which appears in both documents.\nIt is the kind of repetition in which a word used in one sentence is repeated\nin the next following. Here are examples from Relativity.\n\" What is our standard of size? Have we a standard of size? I\nthink our standard is the human body \".\n(p. 4.)\n\"... What about smallness? Is there a limit of smallness? Is the\natom the smallest conceivable thing? The electron is very much\nsmaller \". (p. 5.)\n\" When did it happen? When you saw it? You know well that it\ndid not happen when you saw it. It happened a good time ago \". (p. 1 1.)\nThe figures for this kind of repetition are. Relativity 8-6 and Lodge-\nLeonard 8.\nWith regard to the sprinklings of \" Now \" and \" Well \", there is of\ncourse nothing exceptional in this. Many public speakers slip in these\ninterjections far more frequently than they realise. So also with hyphened\nsentences and repetitions beyond necessity. But I think we do find\nsomething exceptional in the strikingly close proportions of the above as\nthey occur in separate speeches, one by Sir Oliver and the other attributed\nto him as communicator. Let this be tested by inspection of Press\nreports of the speeches made by public men, whether dealing with politics\nor science, or religion. I think it will be then conceded that there is a\ndistinctively Lodge style in which certain habits of speech appear in more\nor less similar proportions, and that this renders his style distinctive. It\nlooks so to me, but I do not claim absolute certainty in absence of further\nmaterial for examination.\nReverting to the frequent use of the short sentence ; I have just opened\none of Lodge's books at random. At once a short sentence caught my eye.\nI turned to another page at random ; here were three of them at the end\nRelativity Lodge-Lsonard\n71-2 62\n24 20\n6 9\n8-6 13\n6-9 6\n\f^5\u00b0 Journal of Society for Psychical Research JUNE, 1945\nof -an ordinary paragraph :\n\" We are free agents. We can choose. We\nknow good from evil \". Taking up the S.P.R. Proceedings of June 1929\nfor the purpose of scanning an article by Lodge, it opened by chance at\np. 484. There I noticed no fev\/er than five of these short sentences in a\nsingle paragraph ! So it would seem that, even in his written work, the\nunique use of the bi'ief sentence appears just as it does in our Lodge-\nLeonard communication.\nI need not go further with the examination ; the curious can do this for\nthemselves.\nWhat have we found? Extracts from Sir Oliver's published works show\nthat the topics introduced in this talk were those on which he held pro-\nnounced opinions in his life-time. Also there is a striking similarity to\nLodge's style of extemporary speech.\nIt remains to ask three questions ;\nthey concern, identity ; is there\nadequate reason for thinking the communication originated with Sir\nOliver? Transmission ; \"Were the communicator's thoughts correctly\ntransmitted? Intention : Was anything attributed to him other than\nhe intended? .\nIdentity\nIt will have been noticed that, with the one exception of Re-incarnation,\nthe beliefs and opinions touched upon had been Sir Oliver's, as shown by\nhis books. And a scrutiny of our verbatim stenographic report shows\nsimilarities of style with the stenographic report of Lodge's Liverpool\nLecture.\nThe strongest evidence, however, is one of which I regret my inability to\nshare with others ; it is the convincing impression of Sir Oliver's presence\nand personality which I felt while listening to this discourse. It was as if\nthe years had rolled back and I was again hearing Sir Oliver broadcast,\nas he did on occasion not long before his death. Here, once more, was the\ndeliberate, impressive manner ; the distinctive vocalisation, the little\npauses and repetitions ; the sense of presence. I am aware that Lodge\noften took sittings with Mrs. Leonard, that she had visited his home and\nwas on intimate terms with him. Yet this knowledge does not in any way\nmodify my conviction that his was the originating mind in this discourse.\nIt may very properly be objected that, if Feda is such a past mistress in\nimitating and reproducing the manner of a communicator as to convey all\nthe above to me, then she might equally well have been imitating Lodge's\nmannerisms, as remembered by her and the medium. I am not moved by\nthis objection. And why not? Because Feda has been equally successful\nin transmitting for several of my deceased acquaintances whom neither\nshe nor the medium had known, heard speak, or even seen ! Yet in these\ninstances, too, an impression of their personal presence came compellingly\non me, and their respective habits of speech were unmistakable. This is\nfact ; whereas it is but toying with fancy to suppose that such convincing\nmannerisms and sense of presence can be produced when the individuals\nconcerned have been unknown to the medium. Is it satisfactory to reject\nevidence m.erely because alternative hypotheses can be imagined, especially\nwhen such hypotheses are unsupported by observed fact?\n\fJUNE, 1945 A Discourse\nThat Feda's imitation is not wholly unconscious may be gathered from\nthe following remarks which I give verbatim, words and grammar :\nFeda : I have got now into a good habit of imitating the way their\nvoices goes up and down, up and down.\nC.D.T. ; That is most valuable.\nFeda : When they goes up and down, up and down, I imitates them,\nbecause it might have a meaning.\nC.D.T. : It does. It helps out the meaning very much.\n. Feda But I can't do it unless I hear the voices. Sometimes they show\nme things ; and sometimes they give it in thought ; and then I don't\nhear.\nC.D.T. : Do you get the idea of up and down even in thought?\nFED-iV : Sometimes, but at other times I only get the meaning, only the\nmeaning, like they would give me the idea of some kind of music,\nbut I wouldn't hear them saying, \" There's a nice piano in that\nhouse \", do you see? I would just get, \" There's some music in that\nplace \". Do you see? Like that.\nThe sense of presence is described so well by Lady Barrett in her\nexcellent book, Personaliiy Sui-vives Death, that I venture to quote there-\nfrom, (p. 199.)\nThere is a more intangible kind of evidence which should be men-\ntioned, though only those who have had personal experience of similar\nsittings can appreciate it. In a Leonard sitting we cannot see the\nvisible form and the changing expressions that used to come and go\nwith interest in discussion ; we cannot hear the spoken voice, with the\nexception of a few whispered words and sentences in direct voice ; we\ncannot feel the grasp of the well-known hand ; but though sight,\nhearing and touch are excluded, we can and do get a sense of the\npresence of our friend in a way that must be experienced in order to be\nrealised.\nThis sounds the m.ost elusive and deceptive of all modes of recog-\nnition, j'Ct I have known men of sceptical mind, previously sure that\ntelepathy from the mind of the sitter explains all, become absolutely\nconvinced of their friend's presence in a sitting, though everything said\nwas already known to the sitter ;\nyet veridical messages given through\na proxy sitter, who had no knowledge of their truth or value, have carried\nno conviction to the same person. Such conviction, however, cannot\nbe passed on to others ; it concerns the individual alone who has had\nthe special experience.\nBut there is, I believe, something rhore to be said in explanation of this\nconvincing sense of presence and personality. Feda will occasionallv tell\nme, after a communicator has done particularly well, that \" he was verv\nclose to-day and that made it very easy for Feda.\" I gather that she\nalludes to a condition in which the communicator, while ostensibly\ntransmitting to Feda, was partially controlling the medium, perhaps\nsufficiently to impress the latter at the same time that he impressed Feda\nwith his thoughts. Thus he had, to some degree, short-circuited Feda\nand conveyed to the sitter more of his personality than if Feda had been,\nas is usually the case, an indispensable link in transm.ission. It is onlv\n\f152 Joiinial of Society for Psychical Research JUNE, 1945\npersons of forceful character and dominating personality who are likely\nto produce this effect. Sir Oliver was certainly such an one.\nThere may be a few readers who will feel the need of knowing the psy-\ncho-analytical attitude of a sitter's mind, both conscious and subconscious.\nThey will possibly say that I found it easy to regard as evidential anything\nwhich pointed towards that which I wished to believe, and that I was not\non my guard against \" wish-fulfilment.\" To such I can say that the evid-\nence is here placed before them and they are at liberty to disregard such\npersonal opinions as I have added. Tihe convictions expressed are my\nown and added because they have some kind of value ; and one is always\ninterested in learning how an observer was impressed by the happenings\nhe recounts.\nI am not one of those who pretend that they are entirely devoid of\npreferences ; that for them, one thing is as welcome as another. Far\nfrom it. I am pleased when finding my previous opinions justified, and\nalso pleased when new facts compel their abandonment for opinions\ncloser to truth. But my very desire for truth and nothing but the truth\nmakes me conscientious and careful over the minutiae of research and the\nestabhshment of its data.\nIn the present case I had not expected to hear from Sir Oliver. The\nannouncement that he was present pleased me, and I was glad to hear\nthat he proposed to speak of his experiences. The statements made were\nmostly in accord with my previous opinions, or slightly expanded ; that\nnaturally pleased me. But the introduction of the reincarnation theme had\nthe opposite effect. Not that I disbelieved, or did not wish to believe ;\nmy mind was open and I should have welcomed evidence warmly. My\nfeeling was that no evidence could be given and that therefore one could\nget no further with that subject. Whether I have since modified that\nopinion would be beside the point and has no place here.\nTransmission\nMuch has been written about Mrs. Leonard's trance, both in S.P.R.\nProceedings and in books giving the experience of sitters. It is assumed\nthat a communicator sends his thoughts to Feda who then sends them to\nthe medium's mind or brain for vocalisation. The \" sending \" in both\ninstances being presumably by telepathy. But it would seem to be tele-\npathy of a stronger and more successful kind than that which we find in\nspontaneous cases, or succeed in producing experimentally. Indeed, so\ngood is this telepathy that Feda speaks of \" hearing \", and there is no\ndoubt but that she seems to herself to catch actual words during the periods\nof a sitting when conditions are at their best. At less favourable times\nFeda would seem to receive only the general ideas, which she then ex-\npresses in her own way. The difference is very marked. On the occasion\nof this Lodge discourse I had the impression that Feda was usually\ntransmitting word for word, sentence by sentence. Where she deemed\nshe had failed, her questions and remarks (all recorded) are self explanatory.\nCommunicators agree in saying that, while in the sitting, they are\nunder some difficulty with memory and their general mental ability.\nThey explain that, on entering the conditions of a sitting, they find their\n\fJUNE, 1945 A Discourse 153\nmind much as it was during earth hfe. It has reverted to conscious and\nsubconscious, available and non-available memory. At death they had\nfound these mental aspects uniting and so atfording them a more accessible\nmemory and greater mental facility. This temporary reversion to the\nformer state is inconvenient, inasmuch as they may find during message-\ngiving that some memories, of which they had proposed to speak, are now\n\" outside \" in the memory area not available to them.\nAnother difficulty of which they speak is the necessity for \" slowing\ndown \" in order to synchronise with the lower rate of human mental\naction. That this might necessitate special attention and care will be\nrealised by anyone who has tried to dictate at the rate of, say, one word\nevery three seconds instead of his usual ten words. And those who have\nhad much to do with persons suffering from advanced cerebro-arterio-\nsclerosis will understand what \" slowing down \" means in practice. For\nsuch invalids are \" slow in the uptake \", and leisurely in response, in\naddition to being more or less incapable of drawing an inference, or\nfollowing a line of reasoning to its conclusion. And so, in talking with\nthem, one falls back on short, simple phrases which but ill express all one\nwould wish to say. Their lack of mental alertness and speed makes the\ndifficulty.\nOwing to his temporarily divided memory a communicator may fail to\nmarshal his facts in the order and detail he had proposed to himself.\nAlso, while engrossed in formulating his next message or idea, he may not\nnotice the way in which his previous thought is being expressed, and he\nis therefore unable to rectify a mistake. Feda sometimes fails to catch his\nwords and, guessing by the context, may mutilate the thought ;\nespecially\nis this likely to happen when the ideas to be conveyed are beyond her\nunderstanding. Again, any indiscreet question by the sitter may seriously\ninterfere with the thread of a communicator's thought, or with the mental\ncondition of the sitting, so raising complications which it is impossible to\nclear up.\nFeda, too, has her problems ;\nfor, according to her own remarks, she is\nfar less alert and balanced than while in her own state and sphere. Her\nmind and that of the medium have partly coalesced and the medium's\nmental activity may resist an unacceptable idea, or may even interpose\nwith some strongly held notion. Once such favourite theme is started it\nmay run on for awhile, despite Feda's efforts to check it.\nThese and other considerations which I have dealt with elsewhere (see\nS.P.R. Proceedings for July 1928) might well account for imperfections of\ntransmission.\nNevertheless, taken as a whole, this communication seems to run with\nlogical smoothness and clarity of expression. And it is what we might\nexpect from one so well aware, as was Sir Oliver, of the intricacies of\ntrance mediumship.\nIntention\nWith one great exception the chief ideas in this discourse are to be\nfound in Sir Oliver's books : the extracts given above might have been\nextensively increased. One can pass from a study of this sitting to read\n\f154 Journal of Society for Psycliical Researcli JUNE, 1945\nLodge's books without feeling any break ; the same personality and the\nsame outlook on life permeate both.\nThe one exception is the definite teaching about reincarnation. In\nlife Lodge was non-committal. The following represents a view which\nhe at times repeated in other words :\nThe psyche or unidentified soul gradually leaks into the body as the\nbody is fitted to receive it, beginning with an infinitesimal portion in\nits early stages, and gradually growing in amount up to a certain measure,\ndependent on the individual's own exertions and opportunities. . . .\nAfter an interval for development, the now identified soul goes back\nwhence it came, either gradually, in the natural course of things, or\nsuddenly if a catastrophe happens, but in either case retaining the\npowers, aptitudes, tastes, memory and experience attained during\nincarnate life. That increase of value it carries with it and contributes\nto the Whole which it rejoins may be\u2014perhaps a larger or sublimal\nself, parts of which may possibly be liable to some modified form of\nreincarnation hereafter. On those questions I withhold judgment.\n{Why I believe in Personal Immortality, p. 27.)\nBut now we find it stated explicitly that return to earth for further testing\nand experience does take place, at least with some if not with all. I\ncannot say that I was pleased when the discourse took this turn. It had\nalways seemed to me that no actual evidence could be forthcoming either\nto confirm or to deny reincarnation. I held an open mind and had never\nfelt an urge to form conclusions about it. Of Mrs Leonard's earlier\nviews on reincarnation I am ignorant ; at the present time she believes\nthat some persons are \" old souls \" and others not. Being aware of this\nI thought that possibly the introduction of the subject might be due to an\nintrusion of her opinion and interest. But as the talk proceeded it became\napparent that reincarnation was the final teaching, up to which well-\nordered thought had been leading.\nReincarnation was rarely mentioned by my father in the earlier years\nof my sittings. He held that it certainly took place with some people,\nbut he did not think actual proof was probable for us on earth. But in\nrecent years he and two other regular communicators have spoken more\nfreely about it, taking it for granted and occasionally touching on its\nimplications. My father has also tried to make somewhat more clear to\nme what it is which can return to inhabit a physical body and again\nexperience life on earth.\nI cannot think that my interest in the subject was sufiicient to warrant\nsupposition that the introduction of this topic was due to my mind, either\nconscious or subconscious.\nIt is to be remembered that the Feda-Leonard mental combination\nmight facilitate an infiltration of ideas from Mrs Leonard. Once begun,\nthis process might be difficult or impossible for Feda to check. As my\nfather once explained, \"Over-pressure taps the subconscious mind of the\nmedium and then something escapes before Feda can stop it. Even after\nhearing the escapes and inaccuracies, she cannot always so control the\nmedium's mind as to put things right. As each thought is given, it is\n\fJUNE, 1945 A Discourse 155\nfixed on the co-operative mind which is created partly by the metlium\nand partly by Feda. Once it is registered there, a counter-suggestion is not\neasily put through.\" Yet Feda has become in the course of years an\nexpert in her work. In connection with Word-Association experiments\nwhich I undertook some years ago under the guidance of Mr Whately\nCarington, it was possible to establish that Feda, while responding to the\nstimulus words, was able to resist very strongly any influence from the\nmedium's mind. For Feda replied with 377 words which were not given\nby either of the other three who were being tested at the same time, viz.\nJohn, Etta, Mrs Leonard ; and of these words she repeated no fewer\nthan 142 during the Reproduction Test. This indicates that Feda was\nthe most markedly independent of the three, or shall we say, better able\nthan either John or Etta to resist being influenced by the medium's mind.\n(See S.P.R. Proceedings, July 1935, p. 391-)\nWe may suppose that so strong a personality as Sir Oliver Lodge, and\none so well acquainted with the intricacies of mediumship, would be able\nto exert the maximum of resistance to a medium's interference.\nIt may be asked how one may know which part of a communication\nshould be considered as representing what was intended and how much\nhas been added, misunderstood or otherwise blurred in process of trans-\nmission? Alas ! no strict rule can be given. It must inevitably be left for\nthe experience and discernment of the sitter to decide.\nI should be glad to know certainly whether Reincarnation was de-\nsignedly asserted by Lodge, or whether the topic was due to infiltration.\nCan one be sure?\nAny hesitancy we may feel would be regarded by Sir Oliver with under-\nstanding sympathy ; for he once wrote, after describing a conversation\n(through Mrs. Leonard) v\/ith his son Raymond and Myers ;\nIt should be needless to say that I take these conversations as akin to\na discussion between friends, none of whom is infallible but some\nbetter informed than others. They are not to be treated as oracular,\nbut they are often suggestive. Any tendency to put too much faith in\nimparted information, attained by other than our own exertion, is to be\ndeprecated. The unwisdom of this can be illustrated from ancient\nexamples.\n{Why I believe in Personal Immortality, p. 108.)\nSpeaking for myself, I cannot say that I confidently trust the validity\nof communications which I am unable to test. I try to treat them for\nwhat they may be worth, as unverifiable matter, and I have a feeling\nthat we possess an instinct which tells us more or less clearly when we\nare on the right path.\n\u2014\n[Phantom Walls, p. 183.)\nThe amount of evidence required for any particular belief varies with\ndifferent persons and with the importance and implications of the matter\nin question. An easy and hasty acceptance of some things makes but\nlittle difference, if any, to one's life and thought. It is quite otherwise\nwith such statements as are given in this discourse. No one need be the\nworse, or at any disadvantage, for accepting them, even if they were but\n\f156 Joiinidl nf Society for Psychical Research JUNE, 1945\nfanciful dreams. If on the other hand they correspond broadly to facts of\nlife here and hereafter, then their importance is immense and should\ninfluence thought and action, our philosophy and our religious life.\nFacts are facts, and they remain unaltered by our opinions, our acceptance\nor our disbelief ; but these attitudes of mind can make a vast difference\nto us !\nSir Oliver hinted that he might have yet more to say. Let us hope it\nmay prove so.\nThe following is added for documentary completeness. There had\nbeen one previous brief communication from Sir Oliver. This was at my\nLeonard sitting on March 7th, 1941. He had died in August, 1940. My\nstenographer was absent, but here are my abbreviated notes.\nFeda : Sir Oliver says, I never regret the day that I embarked on the\nstudy of psychical research. I bless the day when I first came into\ntouch with these matters. It was a great comfort to me while on\nearth and still is. It made many things clear to me which might\notherwise have remained obscure. Life is most interesting. One\nsees many different angles from here. How soon prejudices of earth\npass ! One gets a different sense of values and different ideas of what\nis worth while. It is even diflncult to remember what it was that\npuzzled, and still does, men on earth about this life. So if you will\nformulate some questions, say one or two, I might be able to answer\nthem.\nFeda added that Sir Oliver had been \" called \" from every part\nof the globe, but felt he would get involved in controversial matters\nif he allowed himself to be drawn. \" He means to be cautious, not\nwishing to comphcate things, but to do some useful work in the\nfuture.\"\nThen came a message for his secretary. Miss Alvey, which I forwarded.\nFrom her reply it would appear that Sir Oliver had been aware of certain\nhappenings and that his reference to them was timely and appropriate.\nHere is the relevant part of her letter :\n\" How grateful I am to you for\nsending on the message from Sir Oliver ! It came exactly when I was\nneeding it. I was wanting to know if he approved of what I have done\nwith his papers ; it is a relief 'to know that he does. His words '\nsorting\nand arranging '\nexactly describe what I have been doing. Also it is true\nthat there has been a collapse of a plan about a new post which was\ndisappointing to me. So you see it was all most appropriate and I bless\nhim for sending the message just now.\"\n\fJOURNAL OF THE\nSOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH\nAugust 1945 Vol. XXX1 11\u2014No. 6i6\nCONTENTS\nPAGE\nDiscussion Meetings - - - - - - -i57\n.

A letter has now been received from him, dated\n14 May 1945, in which he informs us that all the staff of the Hellenic S.P.R.\nare safe. \" Our sufferings have been great but we are glad that our sacrifice\nof 1941 has not been in vain and served the final victory.\"\nDR. TENHAEFF\nWe were also very glad to receive from another Hon. Associate of the\nSociety the following letter :\nDear Sirs,\nTo-day, the third day after our liberation, I will write to you to inform\nyou that I prepare myself to resume my work as a psychical researcher.\nThe years of the war were terrific. Thousands of my country-men have\nbeen murdered by the Huns and among them many intellectuals. I myself\nwas hunted by the Germans for many reasons and lived a year as a\n\" onderduiker \" ( = 1 made myself not to be found). One of the reasons\nfor which the Germans would arrest me is that I refused to give my\nlectures at the University of Utrecht when they tried to \" Germanize\n\"\n(I hope this is a good English word) our Universities. The properties of\nthe Dutch S.P.R. have been stolen by the Germans. Not only the money\nbut also our library. This very good library has been presented by Dr\nSeyss Inquart (the Austrian traitor who was the deputy of Hitler in the\nNetherlands) to Dr Alfred Rosenberg, the \" philosopher \" of the third\n\" Reich \". Our \" Tijdschrift voor Parapsychologie \" has been suppressed.\nThe Germans told me that psychical research = American humbug. When\nI told them that they had very good psychical researchers in their country\n(Driesch, Bender and others) but none of these Nazi barbars had heard\nthe names of those. (I believe that many of them never heard of Goethe\nand Schiller.)\nAs to psychical research\u2014I collected many cases of zvar predictions {some\nvery interesting). I hope that you in England will co-operate with me {our\nDutch S.P.R.) to collect a great many {zvell established) cases of telepathy,\nprediction etc. in ivar time.\nI hope that in future our co-operation will be very close. Our soldiers\nand sailors fought side by side with the soldiers and sailors of your\nadmirable country. Yesterday your troops entered our town and the\nenthusiasm of the population was beyond description. So there will also\n\fi6o Journal of Society for Psycliical Research august, 1945\nbe a close co-operation between the scholars of our countries. This will\nbe to the profit of Humanity.\nI hope to hear soon from you in a favourable way.\nKindest regards,\nW. H. C. Tenhaeff.\nWe have received a letter from another Dutch Member, Mr Zorab, to\nmuch the same effect. He adds that the library of the Dutch S.P.R. was\nput on show at an \" Exhibition of Anglo-American depravity \" organised\nby Rosenberg.\nCASE : A HALLUCINATION\n\u2022\nINCLUDING A VERIDICAL ELEMENT\nThis case, dating from June 1943, was described in a letter to the Hon.\nSecretary from Mrs Siegfried Sassoon, who was recently elected a member\nof the Society. The percipient, Mrs Sassoon's sister-in-law, Mrs Richard\nGatty, subsequently wrote the following account of her experience, dated\n24 April 1945. It will be seen that the experience had been mentioned by\nMrs Gatty in a letter to her husband dated 21 June 1943, the day after the\nexperience occurred : he was then serving in North Africa.\n\" As far as I remember I was lying in bed (I had just had a baby) about\n10 o'clock on June 20th. The unlined chintz curtains were, I think,\ndrawn, but the room faced west and the sun had not gone down and the\nroom was well lit with a golden light. My bed was standing with its head\njust to the left of the window facing the door. The room was painted\nv\/hite. My impression was that the door opened and my husband came in\nlooking sunburnt and wearing a grey flannel suit. I only saw his head and\nshoulders round the side of the door but I felt as if he came across to the\nbed and made as if to kneel down beside it. At this point I '\ncame to '\nand\nnoticed that the bedside table stood in the spot where I thought he had been.\n\" My husband looked completely and absolutely real\u2014no insubstantial-\nness, no ghostliness\u2014and he smiled and moved (it wasn't a fixed tableau).\nIt wasn't in the least like the pictures you conjure up in memory. I\ndefinitely, for about 30 seconds, thought it was him. My heart began to\nthump and I altogether manifested all the signs that I would have done if it\nhad been him in the flesh. The lighting was completely natural. One\npoint is that the first visual impression was the strongest and that it all\n'\ntailed of '\nuntil my realisation of the bedside table completely broke the\nspell. I remember feeling that, when I had realised it wasn't really him, it\nmight have been possible to have prolonged the sensation of his presence\nbut that it was not possible to see him again. Of course, though, while it\nwas actually happening I didn't think about it at all as it seemed fact not a\npsychical experience.\n\" I may say that I have never had an experience that could be considered\nout of the ordinary before and am rather a matter-of-fact and materialistic\nperson.\"\nMrs Gatty has allowed the Hon. Secretary to see the two contemporary\ndocuments which refer to her experience, and to the interesting fact that at\nthe time of the hallucination her husband was wearing a grey civilian suit\n\fAUGUST, 1945\n\"\nCase 161\nduring a short period of emergency and was particularly conscious of his\nappearance in it. The first of the following extracts is from the letter,\nmentioned above, in which Mrs Gatty told her husband briefly of the\nexperience. The letter was sent by air mail and is dated 21 June 1943 :\n\" Last night just as I was going off to sleep I had an extraordinarily\nvivid impression of you opening the door and coming in very sunburnt and\ndressed in a grey flannel suit! It made me feel just as if you really had\nappeared but unfortunately I came to only too quickly.\"\nThis dates the experience as having occurred late on 20 June, 1943. The\nnext extract is from a letter dated 9 July, 1943, from Capt. R. Gatty to his\nwife :\n\" You talked in the most appetising way of my coming in to see you in a\ngrey flannel suit. I only wish it could have been true : but at the moment I\nseem to be completely stuck here. Curious though it may seem, however,\non the 2ist June I was wearing a grey suit of civilian clothes, as all my\nuniform except that at the wash had been blitzed in Pantellaria by a most\nungentlemanly Bosch bomb. You certainly would have laughed to see me\nin that suit\u2014it was made for a man with a waist of at least 54\"\u2014I was lost\nin the trousers.\"\nIn reply to questions Mrs Gatty added the following information in a\nletter dated 3 May 1945 :\n\" I doubt if I could have noticed that my husband was wearing an ill-\nfitting suit because I only saw his head, shoulder and arm round the edge\nof the door\u2014like this. (A sketch is given of a figure holding a door partly\nopen and looking round the edge of it.) He was wearing a collar and tie\nand I have ascertained from my husband that he was in reality, though in\nthat great heat I should have expected him not to. The suit was the kind\nof suit I had seen him wear in civilian life. He is not absolutely certain\nwhether he first put it on in the evening of the 19th or the morning of the\n20th and he continued wearing it for 3 or 4 days.\n\" The baby was born at 12.30 a.m. B.D.S.T. on June 19th. My ex-\nperience was therefore about 44 hours afterwards. I had the baby with\nlittle trouble but with some anaesthetics, and I was not running a tempera-\nture or in any way ill.\"\nIt is not beyond chance coincidence that Mrs Gatty should have visual-\nised her husband as wearing a grey suit, \" the kind of suit I had seen him\nwear in civilian life \", when in fact he was wearing a civilian suit of this\ncolour, but the fact that he was wearing this suit for only a short period and\nwas conscious of its odd appearance suggests some probability that the\nveridical element in the hallucination was not due to chance.\n\" THE REALITY OF PSYCHIC PHENOMENA \"\n{A Summary of the paper read at the Private Meeting on gth June, ig45)\nBy Donald J. West\nThe discussion was opened by the sceptic saying that the evidence for the\nreality of supernormal phenomena is not as conclusive as is supposed by\nthe average S.P.R. member. Believer and sceptic agreed that the crucial\npoint was telepathy : if that were not established as a true psychic pheno-\n\f1 62 Journal of Society for Psychical Research august, 1945\nmenon, then nothing was. There were three main types of evidence for\ntelepathy, crisis apparitions, experimental ESP and mediums. The\nevidence from apparitions was discussed first.\nThe believer cited the census of hallucinations as refuting the chance\ncoincidence hypothesis. After more than ample corrections had'been made\nfor all possible sources of error, the census showed that one in every forty-\nthree recognised human apparitions coincides (within twelve hours either\nway), with its agent's death ; whereas death statistics show that only one\nperson in nineteen thousand of the general population dies in a given\ntwenty-four hour span. The sceptic remained unconvinced, mainly\nbecause the figures were produced on the assumption that all of the sixty-\nfive cases included in the census count were genuine. Hardly any of the\ncases reached what the sceptic considered a satisfactory evidential level,\nso that the vast majority could be explained normally by fraud, delusion,\nfaulty memory and hallucinations due to expectancy. The odd one or two\ncases that were fairly evidential could have been chance-coincidences.\nThe believer then proceeded to mention apparitions that give a great\ndeal of veridical information, quoting the well-known case of Robert\nMackenzie ^ as an example. The sceptic agreed that the case was typical\nand replied with a destructive analysis, in which he pointed out the case\ndepended almost entirely on the percipient's unsubstantiated word.\nThen the believer began to argue that the clearly recognisable common\nfeatures running through the narratives was evidence of genuineness. The\nsceptic maintained that common features in psychic hallucinations might\nbe due to the popular ideas of how a telepathic apparition should appear\nand behave. The believer went on to say that not only did genuine cases\nhave features in common, but they also conformed to type, e.g. haunting,\npoltergeist, crisis case etc. The sceptic retorted that none were truer to\ntype than the poltergeist, yet this was the one variety the supernormality\nof which is doubted by psychical researchers themselves.\nThe believer passed on to experimentally induced apparitions and col-\nlectively perceived apparitions. The sceptic would accept neither. There\nwere only half a dozen rather unsatisfactory cases of experimentally\ninduced apparitions in S.P.R. literature, all of which belonged to the last\ncentury. Collective cases were viewed with distrust by the early investi-\ngators and when H. and E. B. Hart ^ conducted an exhaustive search for\nexamples they could not find a single first class evidential crisis apparition\ncollectively perceived.\nThe believer concluded the discussion on apparitions by saying that\nalthough no single case or single line of evidence was conclusive, the evi-\ndence as a whole all pointed in the same direction, namely that of the\ntelepathic hypothesis. The sceptic insisted that it was a matter of opinion\nwhether this supposed unity of pattern ijiade up for all the flaws and\nweaknesses of the evidence.\nExperimental evidence was discussed next. The sceptic violently\ncriticised the lax conditions of the earlier qualitative experiments. The\nreports were never detailed enough to assure one that fraud and hyper-\naesthesia had been excluded. The question of fraud was particularly acute,\nbecause qualitative experiments would only work with specially gifted\n^ Proc. S.P.R. in. 9S- ^ Proc. S.P.R. xli. 205.\n\fAUGUST, 1945 The Reality of Psychic Phenomena 163\npercipients. The believer argued that motive for fraud was absent and\nthat the research was under the competent control of well-known experi-\nmenters. The sceptic replied that acumen displayed in another science\nwas not necessarily transferable to psychical research, that authoritarian\nopinions carry little weight and that fraud should be excluded by the con-\nditions and not by the reputations of the experimenters. Also there had\nbeen two cases of fraud,^ one of which was only discovered by accident,\n-\nwhich prove that early experiments were not fraud-proof and suggest that\nmany charlatans may have escaped unchallenged.\nThe Gilbert Murray experiments were criticised because hyperaesthesia\nhad been suggested as a probable explanation and experiments had never\nbeen carried out to disprove that explanation. Dr Hettinger's experiments\nwith psychometrists were said to be unsatisfactory, not in principle, but on\naccount of the lack of information given in the reports. Hettinger's\nquoted examples were said to be a selection, but the amount of material\nfrom which they were abstracted was not indicated. Some of the supposed\ncoincidences appeared far-fetched.\nThe believer went on to discuss statistical experiments and the sceptic\nwas forced to admit that some of the latest card-guessing experiments\nwere statistically perfect. However, he would not admit that they\namounted to a scientific proof of ESP. There were several suspicious\nfeatures. Firstly, the results were meagre, nothing like the wonderful\ncoincidences that were said to occur in spontaneous psychic occurrences.\nSecondly, results had fallen off as conditions improved. Thirdly, the ex-\nperiments were not repeatable. English experiments had failed to re-\nproduce the consistent successes obtained in America with unselected\npercipients and PK subjects. Lastly, it was bad enough that statistics had\nto be used at all, but the manoeuvres indulged in by ESP experimenters\nwere positively Machiavellian. When a percipient failed to score above\nchance expectation, one would think there would he nothing more to be\nsaid, but the ESP genius starts looking around for other effects, such as\nsalience, displacement, negative deviations and abnormal hit distributions.\nIn any ordinary research problem, such as the determination of whether\na chemical reaction is exothermic, the experiment is designed to give a\ndirect positive or negative answer to whatever question is being asked.\nIn this case a simple rise or fall in thermometer reading is all that is looked\nfor. The sceptic thought it strange how people who could see the absurdity\nof hunting for meaningless patterns in thermometer readings, would\nnevertheless condone a similar absurdity in ESP experiments. The\nbeliever replied that ESP effects, although they could be estimated by a\nlarge variety of statistical tests, really boiled down to a few consistent\nphenomena that were capable of a theoretical interpretation by the Associa-\ntion Theory. The sceptic disagreed and maintained that the Association\nTheory did not explain the nature of the link between psychons of different\nminds, which was the crux of the difficulty.\nMediums were the last item in the discussion. In the sceptic's opinion,\nthe great skill and cunning possessed by first class mental mediums was\nunderestimated. Wonderfully dextrous methods of chicanery were justly\n^ Proc. S.P.R. i. 161\u2014215 ;\nJoitrn. xv. 115-32.\n^ Proc. S.P.R. v. 269; Journ. iii. 164.\n\f164 Journal of Society for Psychical Research august, 1945\nattributed to physical mediums, but people failed to see that mental\nmediums were equally accomplished in their own lines of fraud, namely,\nspying, filching information, picking pockets and reading letters and\njudging character and circumstances from sitters' involuntary reactions\nand tones of voice.\nThe believer said that there were mediumistic cases which fraud would\nnot explain, to which the sceptic retorted that chance coincidence was\nanother possibility. \" Readers of psychic literature \", he said, \" only hear\nof the successes of famous mistresses of the art; They do not realise how\nrare good mediums are.\" The believer pointed out that the best\nevidenced mediums, like Mrs Piper and Mrs Leonard, were the ones t^iat\nwere most consistently successful and difficult to explain either by fraud\nor by chance coincidence. To this the sceptic put forward a fresh sug-\ngestion, namely that mediumistic phenomena might be hallucinatory.\n\" In his recent paper on D. D. Home, Dr Dingwall mentioned an American\nphysical medium in whose presence sitters would see and feel animals and\nother manifestations that had no reality outside their own imagination.\nWhy can't sitters with mental mediums receive spirit messages of similar\nsubjective origin?\n\"\nThe believer challenged the sceptic to explain away successful proxy\nsittings. \" Fraud won't help, because the sitter has no more information\nthan the medium. Hallucination won't help because there is no one\npresent who could conjure the necessary vision \".\nThe sceptic claimed that fraud was the explanation. He drew attention\nto the fact that proxy sittings were becoming things of the past, and that\nthere weren't a great number on record. He said that the reports omitted\nthe most important details, namely how closely the proxy sitter guarded\nfrom all and sundry the name, address, letters and other information\npertaining to the absent sitter. \" It might be thought that attention to\nsuch details is fantastic, but it is no more so than the precautions necessary\nin the face of freaks like the regurgitation of cheese-cloth phantoms \".\nLastly, the question of supernormally acquired knowledge or technical\ninformation was discussed. The believer mentioned Patience Worth, but\nthe sceptic tersely rejected this and all similar cases. \" Since the language\nof the communications was recognised, a knowledge of it must have been\nin existence. I would rather suppose that the medium had somehow\nacquired this knowledge surreptitiously, than assume there was anything\nsupernormal. The available records obviously could not give such a com-\nplete account of the medium's life as to convince one that it was impossible\nfor her to have at one time carried out some stealthy philological research.\"\nAn interesting discussion followed the reading. Mrs Goldney, who\nwas in the chair, mentioned the Soal-Goldney experiments, which\nexcluded every normal explanation so far suggested. Mr West replied that\nthe sceptic's argument was not tliat some apparently perfect experiments\nhad not been pcrform.ed, but that unlike all other scientific experiments\nthey were not repeatable. Mr West urged that attempts should be made\nto repeat the few experiments that possessed the appearance of repeatability;\nnamely Carington's paranormal cognition of drawings and Hettinger's\nexperiments.\n\fJOURNAL OF THE\nSOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH\nOctober 1945 ' Vol. XXXIII\u2014No. 617\n' CONTENTS\nPAGE\nNotice of Meeting - - - - - - - -165\n\u2022New Members - - - - - - - -166\nObituary - - - - - - - - -166\nReflections on Mediumship - - - - - -166\nReincarnation - - - - - - - -170\nCorrespondence - - - - - - - -171\nReview - - - .- - - - - -172\n: NOTICE OF MEETING\nTHE EIGHTH\nFREDERIC W.

Lady Barrett, who held a distinguished position in\nmedical science joined the Society in 1916. In 1937 she published a book,\nPersonality Survives Death, in which she gave an account of communica-\ntions received by her through Mrs Leonard, and purporting to come from\nher late husband. The book is reviewed in the S.P.R. Journal for\nDecember 1937.\nREFLECTIONS ON MEDIUMSHIP\nThe statement made by Sceptic in Donald West's paper that \" readers of\npsychic literature do not realise how rare good mediums are \", may be\n\fOCTOBER, 1945 Reflections on Mediiimsliip 167\ntrue for those people who are satisfied with being but readers of psychic\nHterature. But for those who carry out research on their own it is evident\nthat, not only are good mediums rare, but probably non-existent in what\nconcerns proof of communication with the dead. I incline to endorse\nSceptic's opinion that manifestations tending to prove communication\nmay have no reality outside the sitter's imagination, though I would add:\nor of the medium's. For myself I have never obtained from mediums\nanything but reflections of my mind, either conscious, semi-conscious,\nor unconscious, with colouring which I view as from the medium's.\nInstances of my experience may be of interest.\nIn September 1944, after the liberation of Paris, I booked a private\nsitting with Miss Mary Methuen through The International Institute for\nPsychic Investigation where I was unknown. I gave no name and no\naddress. The Secretary, from our few minutes' talk, may have gathered\nthat I am French. But she had no possibility of seeking particulars of my\nFrench relatives, for the lapse of time between booking and the sitting-\nwas but two days, and this in War time. At the sitting French names were\ngiven me, correctly pronounced. One, Lise, is a rare name in France (I\nknow but one), and in the case of my sister who bears it, it is not an abbre-\nviation but her actual name. The medium gave it without hesitation,\nstating that it was my sister's. I replied :\n\" For all I know Lise is alive \".\n\" Yes,\" said the medium, \" she is, but people on the other side have been\nanxious about her as you are ;\nthey tell you not to be ; all will be well \".\nThe statement was extremely vague, but it was staggering to hear the\nname.\nOn the 5th of June 1945, I sat with Mr Arthur Bhaduri, a sitting again\narranged by The International Institute for Psychic Investigation, but this\ntime both my name and address being given. Yet the lapse of time\nbetween booking and sitting was less than one week. It is impossible\nthat information could have been obtained about my family in Paris.\nHad the medium such information, he made such poor use of it that this\nwould give him away as a fool rather than a fraud. He gave me many\nnames, in three languages and all accurate. A series of five names was\nespecially interesting, since I could not remember them all and had to\nlook them up in a genealogy which I had read years previously but for-\ngotten, though the names must have dwelt in my subconscious. Then\ncame the name of Lise, perfectly pronounced and without beating about\nthe bush. He said :\n\" I see her close to you, a near relative.\" \" Yes, my\nsister, but Lise two months ago was alive \". \"I am sorry to say \",\nexplained the medium, \" that now she is dead \". There were no further\nexplanations, this being but a group sitting. As soon as I reached home\nI telephoned my son to inform him, wishing to have a witness, no matter\nwhat evidence might follow. For 25 days I felt anxious, then came a\nletter from Lise, dated posterior to my sitting.\nWhat had happened.? Twice a name, uncommon, foreign and closely\nconnected with me had been given independently by two mediums who\ncould not know anything about my Lise. But what did \/ know.''\nFirst sitting. Without being aware of having Lise especially on the\nbrain, I had yet for weeks wondered if I would now hear from her direct.\nBut I did not imagine her dead, for I had received indirect news of her\n\f1 68 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, 1945\nthroughout the War from a nephew, a prisoner-of-war in Germany. I\nfelt sure she was alive, but was worried about her welfare.\nSecond sitting. I had, between the two sittings, received three letters\nfrom Lise containing news of much hardship. In April The Lancet and\nother medical papers here reported a fairly bad epidemic of typhoid fever\nin Paris. By June, I had been without letters from Lise for two months.\nThere is no doubt but that my mind was overshadowed by Lise's diffi-\nculties, and her silence at a time of epidemic led me to think that she\nmight be dead.\nReflections : It is admitted that messages can come from the sitter's\nsubconscious rather than from the disembodied astral agent called a\nspirit. It is also claimed that the trained sensitive is able to discern which.\nIs this true? I doubt it. In actual practice the medium sometimes guards\nhimself against possible error. Mr Bhaduri did not. He emphatically\nstated that Lise was dead.\nThis brings my mind back to 19 15, when I consulted Mrs Osborne\nLeonard and Horace Leaf about a \" missing \" brother. I am now (1945)\nconvinced that these sittings reflected my and my sister-in-law's frames\nof mind, for she was with me. The information that we had received at\nthe time of the notification that my brother was \" missing \" had given us\nhopes that he was alive, though we were completely puzzled as to where\nhe might be. What was the result? Both Horace Leaf and Mrs Leonard\npronounced our beloved alive, but otherwise all was confusion. Quota-\ntions from letters show that Horace Leaf stated that my brother \" had\nbeen ill but was recovered \", while Mrs Leonard spoke of \" shock and a\nfall \", adding \" he has not the pain now \", but \" passed from a state of\nsuspended animation to a state of irritation \". In fact, the mediums read\nour states of mind of hope and confusion. Until thirty years later no\nmedium explained my brother's death, which yet I came to presume.\nThe belated explanation was extremely vague but, characteristically, it\nfitted a vivid dream I had had at the time of my brother's disappearance\n(it may even have been pre-cognitive ; I was not then sufiiciently inter-\nested to notice the date, which was, however, just a few days before or a\nfew days after his disappearance). The medium who gave this belated\nexplanation was Mr Bhaduri at the sitting of June 5th 1945, when he\nstated that it was my brother's \" death \" which had first brought me to\ninvestigate psychic phenomena, which is true. Then he casually men-\ntioned the way of death, which fitted the dream mentioned above and\nalso a vision, some twelve years after the said dream, a vision which was\na prolongation of another vivid dream. But all through these years I had\nhad several vivid and dramatic dreams about my brother's fate, and all\ncontradictory. Why should I believe one more than the others? But,\nnaturally in the course of thirty years, my mind has, unconsciously,\naccepted as probably true the two dreams which showed him dead. The\nothers showed him alive, though demented, etc. At last one medium\nread my acceptance, and pictured it much as I had twice done in dreams\nand one vision.\nThese instances form a suggestive sequence once illuminated by the\nclimax, i.e. the evidence that Lise is not dead. I have had besides these\nmany interesting proofs of mind reading by mediums, but never of\n\fOCTOBER, 1945 Reflections on Mediumship 169\ncommunication. This mind reading can be bad, middling, good and,\nnow and again, striking, though always queerly limited. It remains so\ninteresting 'that I, for one, have no objection to a medium fishing for\ninformation, for by so fishing he is thoroughly tested by the sitter, at least\nas to this power of mind reading. Thus a medium recently introduced me\nto his German guide, asking if 1 objected. I said :\n\" No, I am a pacifist \".\nThis was a clue. But this medium was a poor mind reader. Instead of\ntelling me of Tolstoy's influence in my life, of a German friend who died\nin this country during this war, and suftered a great deal on account of\nbeing both German and a pacifist, the medium pictured Dick Sheppard\nstanding behind me, a man who has not influenced me.\nWhat inferences do I drcnv from my experience? (a) A firm belief that\nthat mediums possess a gift for mind reading which may lead to greater\ndiscoveries if fully understood and developed.\n(b) An equally firm doubt that this gift has, so far, enabled them to\ncommunicate with the dead. So even in the evidential cases which some\npsychic researchers accept as proving communication, I often see but\nreflection of either the sitter's mind, or the medium's or both. A typical\nexample is my reaction to the Discourse given through Mrs Leonard and\nattributed to Sir Oliver Lodge published in June Journal. I remember\nforemost the words of Lodge quoted at the opening of this Discourse.\nBut to the statement that \" a landscape seen through coloured or imperfect\nglass may be changed and distorted and yet it is something like reality \",\nI give a slightly different interpretation, since the reality is, for me,\nthrough the glass of my own mind, i.e. the sitter's mind ; but it may also\nbe the medium's, as perhaps in this Discourse.\n(c) A realisation that (since the medium only contacts my states of\nmind), had my anxiety been justified in June 1945 and Lise proved dead,\nit was even then but my anxiety the medium had seen. It was not com-\nmunication. In so called predictions (and how many do we not get\nthrough mediums !) it feels the same. The reality is probably the sitter's\nimagination, and predictions turn out true or false in the ratio in which\nthe sitter's mind is apt to wish accurately or otherwise.\n{d) Yet I retain one or two unexplainable cases which might prove\ncommunication. The most striking is The Ear of Dionysius with its\nabstruse classical knowledge. Yet even here, for lack of sufficient acquaint-\nance with the psycho-analytical attitude of the sitters' and mediums'\nminds, I give great weight to Miss Stawell's criticism (Vol. XXIX, Part\nLXXIV).\nConclusion. It is so obvious that no sitting should be held without the\nemployment of a competent psychologist to help both medium and sitter\nto analyse the evidence, that it is to be hoped that, now the war is over,\nthe sole scientific body well placed to provide this scientific guarantee,\ni.e. The Society for Psychical Research, will renew its pre-war investigations\nof mediums, and place those more easily within reach of the keen and\ncritical sitter.\nFran^oise Delisle\n.\n'\n;\n(Mme F. Lafitte-Cyon).\n\fJournal of Society for Psychical Research October, 1945\nRE-INCARNATION\nIn Mr Drayton Thomas's interesting paper, printed in t\\\\&'joiirnal for\nJune last, on some communications from Sir Oliver Lodge received\nthrough Mrs Leonard, occurred (p. 137) the following :\n\u2014\n\" Now during the earth life I kept an open mind about this vexed\nquestion of re-incarnation. . . . Well, now I know it is a fact. It is true,\ntherefore I must state it as true, that, according to my personal experience,\nit is true ; and I have had many talks with my friend Myers about it. I\nhave asked him why he did not tell me more about it, especially during\nmy many sittings with Feda. He said that he thought that at times the\nmedium had had an aversion to the idea ...\"\nIt is perfectly true, as Mr Thomas points out, that Sir Oliver's state-\nment as to keeping an open mind on re-incarnation can be supported by\nquotations from his books : see the passage from Why I believe in Personal\nImmortality, quoted p. 154. But the discarnate Myers had not left it an\nopen question: he had pronounced most definitely against it.\nNo one knew this better than Lodge during his \" earth life \", as can be\nseen by reading the paper he contributed to Vol. XXV of our Proceedings ;\nsee particularly pp. 122, 123. In order to test the classical knov\/ledge of\nMrs Piper's Myers control, Mr G. B. Dorr had put to Mrs Piper in\nAmerica a question relating to Lethe. In order to ascertain whether Mrs\nWillett's Myers control had any knowledge of Mr Dorr's question, Lodge\nhanded to Mrs Willett a sealed envelope containing the following question :\n\" My dear Myers, I want to aks you a question\u2014not an idle one. What\ndoes the word Lethe suggest to you ? .\". . Oliver Lodge.\"\nThis envelope was opened by Mrs Willett on the 4th February 1910,\nwhen, sitting by herself, she was producing automatic writing. The\nscript began at once : - .\n-\nMyers the Will again to live\nthe Will again to live the\nRiver of forgetfulness\nnot re-incarnation\nOnly once does the Soul\ndescend the way that leads\nto incarnation.\nThe words \" the Will again to live \" are taken from Myers's own\ntranslation in Classical Essays of a famous passage in Vergil (Aen. VI,\n748-751), which mentions Lethe : See Proc. XXV, p. 131. They should\nnot be taken as representing the views of Willett-Myers, the expression of\nwhich begins with the emphatic repudiation, \" not re-incarnation \".\nThe opinions of Myers during his \" earth life \" are not strictly relevant,\nbut it may be noted that in his books he accepts the idea of pre-existence,\nas appears from the poem in Fragments of Prose and Poetry beginning\nSoul, that in some high world hast made\nPre-natal, unbewailing choice;\npre-existence, however, does not necessarily imply re-incarnation, and the\ntone of his references to re-incarnation in Hitman Personality (Vol II,\n\fOCTOBER, 1945 Correspondence\npp. 137, 139) suggests a dislike of the idea going beyond his criticism\nof the unsatisfactory nature of the evidence for it.\nIt is of course quite possible that Myers, who appears in the extract I\nhave quoted from Mr Thomas's paper as a believer in re-incarnation, has\nchanged his views since Mrs Willett's script of 4th February 1910 ; but\nit seems to me extremely strange that Lodge, who during his life attached\nvery great importance to Willett-Myers communications, should in com-\nmunicating through Feda make no reference to this script, and show no\nawareness of any discrepancy calling for explanation.\nW. H. Salter\nCORRESPONDENCE\nSir,\u2014The Uncertainty Principle has been put to all manner of use since\nit was first postulated by Heisenberg in the field of wave mechanics.\nStatements such as \" the Uncertainty in the Universe shows the Finger of\nGod \" have made us shudder. And now Mr Wilson propounds an\nInaccuracy Theory of E.S.P.\nIn his article, he starts off with an account of the Thesis of Lord Cher-\nwell, which, he sa\\^s, \" does satisfy m.any of the requirements of quantum\nmechanics. We may therefore take it as a basis upon which to build a\ntheory of E.S.P.\" Why?\nNext, he makes two assumptions. Both of these are, as far as I know,\nwithout foundation. First, \" that E.S.P. is a physical process or a semi-\nphysical process \". Second, \" that it requires a certain amount of energy\nE, where E is a function of the sensitive concerned \". I do not know\nwhat \" semi-physical \" means. But I know of no shred of evidence which\nsuggests that E.S.P. has a physical nature. Nothing so far discovered can\nfit in E.S.P. with the theories developed by phj-sical science to account\nfor the world of the five senses. Of the conditions under which it functions\nwe know little. The time displacement effect recently discovered has\nfurther indicated the depths which remain to be investigated. We seem\nto be dealing with a class of phenomena so strange and so new that experi-\nment, and not preconceived theory, is more than ever necessary for head-\nway to be made.\nApart from this aspect of Mr Wilson's letter, I find it rather curious\nthat Soal's 3-second displacement could be identified with '\nan inaccuracy\nAt'. Surely the Uncertainty principle applies only to microcosmic\nsingle observations. Inherent uncertainty in measurement tends to cancel\nout in a large number of observations, and statistical interpretation is\nrequired to analyse the results.\nYours sincerely,\n\u2022\n-\nJoyce Fairbairn\nSir,\u2014Dr and Mrs Bendit's letter in the March-April number of the\nJournal advocates less exclusive preoccupation with objective experimen-\ntation and more attention to psychological observations. By studying the\n\f172 Joiu nal of Sociely for Psychical Research October, 1945\npsychological background of psi, they hope to gain a deeper insight into\nthe mechanism of the phenomenon.\nWithout doubt, this is a laudable ambition. I have myself expressed\nthe opinion that the key to the explanation of bizarre ESP effects, such as\nwere observed in my own card guesses, will be found in the psychological\nfactors at work. Dr Dingwall believes that there is a correlation between\npsychological conflict and physical mediumship.\nAll the same, the psychological approach has its dangers. The psycho-\nlogist's role is of necessity that of a passive observer rather than an active\nexperimenter. Even in its own sphere, this method is notorious for its\nliability to error ; witness the conflicting systems of psycho-analysis that\nhave evoked much derisive comment. Application to psychical pheno-\nmena calls for special caution.\nEfforts at introspection of paranormal processes have been conspicuous\nfailures. Sensitives' beliefs appear to be a matter of individual environ-\nment. Joan of Arc and other saints might attribute their powers to angelic\nguidance, but witches put their trust in magic rites, dowsers in \" radia-\ntions \", fortune-tellers in palmistry and modern mediums in spirits of the\ndead.\nI would suggest that the policy recommended by the Bendits be followed\nonly with the utmost reserve. The technique of psychical experiments\nhas been brought to a fine pitch, and there are no grounds for complaint\nas to their productivity. The S.P.R. is at last getting some academic\nrecognition for the high quality of its researches, and it would be a great\npity to do anything to lower the standard at this jimcturc. Observe as\nmuch as possible by all means, but reserve judgements until they can be\nput to the test of controlled experiments.\nDonald J. West\nREVIEW\nThe Dawn of a New Day. A Revelation. By C. C. Keith. Burton\nPublishing Company, Kansas City, Missouri. 1945. $3.00. Pp. 303.\nThis book gives an account of some of the communications received by\nan American professional man through what is usually called automatic\nwriting ; in fact for many readers who may find it difficult to attach any\ngreat degree of credence to the messages, the author's description of the\nway in which the messages are dictated to him will seem the most inter-\nesting feature of the book. The messages claim to be of divers origin\nfrom former inhabitants of this planet such as Socrates and King Alfred,\nwho rather oddly describes himself as \" King of the Britons \", as well as\nfrom beings of former creations and the inhabitants of planets that have\nceased to exist. The author claims that \" when the activities of the mind\nare under complete control it is possible to speak understandingly with\nother intellects throughout the universe.

On behalf of all our readers we offer our sincerest\nsympathy to Mrs Richmond and the family in their bereavement. An\naccount of Mr Richmond's work for psychical research will be printed later.\nAN S.P.R. PAMPHLET\nA TWENTY-PAGE pamphlet, entitled The Society for Psychical Research :\nWhat It Is : What It Has Accomplished : Why Its Work Is Important,\nhas been printed by the Society : the title adequately describes the nature\nof the contents. It deals with matters famihar to Members, and while\nnot designed to make a popular appeal, is intended mainly for distribution\namong such non-members as might, if more fully informed, take a con-\nstructive interest in the Society's^ work. The Council hope that it will\nmeet the need that has often been felt when editors, publishers and others\nwho have the public ear, have asked for a brief account of the S.P.R. and\nthe work it has done and is doing.\nMembers wishing for copies can obtain them from the Secretary,\nprice 3d. each, including postage. It should be added that the number of\ncopies printed is limited.\nTHE JOURNAL\nThe Council have decided that the time has now come to make some\nchange as regards the privacy of the Journal.\nFounded in 1884 with Sir William Barrett as its first Editor, the Journal\nwas designed to give information as to business transacted at Council\n\fNOV.-DEC. 1945 The Journal ^75\nMeetings, to provide abstracts of papers later to be published in full in\nProceedings and to print communications of minor importance not suitable\nfor Proceedings.\nThese purposes the Journal has served, but it has also been the first,\nand sometimes the only, place in which have appeared most of the spon-\ntaneous cases reported to the Society and thought of sufficient interest to\nprint. The privacy of the Journal undoubtedly in the early years of the\nSociety favoured the receipt of reports of many cases that the persons\nconcerned might have shrunk from making public, and may have induced\nmany of such persons to allow their real names to appear. The Council\nbelieve that popular sentiment has changed, and that the old practice has\noutlived its utility. They propose for the future, whenever circumstances\nare such as to make a wish for some privacy reasonable, to offer persons\ncontributing cases the protection of fictitious names, but not to give an\nundertaking that the report of the case, if any is printed, will appear in a\nprivate Journal.\nIt was a grave disadvantage of the old rule that many Journal cases of\ninterest and importance were not as well known as they deserved to be.\nAnyone wishing to quote them, e.g. in a book, had to institute a cumbrous\nprocess of obtaining the consent of the Council, who had themselves to\nconsult the persons concerned. In consequence some good cases have\nnot been published till after a long lapse of time, and some not at all.\nThere are however other matters for which privacy is desirable, such as\nthe finances and internal organisation of the Society. A private Journal is\nalso a convenient medium for a franker discussion on matters of interest to\nour members than any publication could provide.\nIt is intended therefore to issue two types of Journal to members, the\nfirst a private issue of the kind with which they are familiar, and another\nto which no privacy attaches. This latter kind will be issued from time\nto time, at least once a year. Copies will be available for sale to non-\nmembers at a reasonable price, and it is hoped through it to reach readers\nwho at present see neither our Journal nor our Proceedings. With this end\nin view the non-private issue will contain not only reports of recent good\ncases, if any are available, but articles on recent research, reviews, etc.,\nall as regards substance not below the Society's standard, but not too\ntechnical in style for the general reader.\nEach type will be distinguished by a notice on the front page stating\nwhether it is private or not. Both types will be alike in size of page, and\nwill be included in the bound volumes. To prevent misconception as\nregards the non-private Journals, each issue of this type will bear a notice\nto the effect that the responsibility for statements of fact or opinion rests\nsolely with the contributor.\nCORRESPONDENCE\nSir,\u2014I think it may be doubted whether Miss Fairbairn's letter in the\nlast number of the Journal shows a just appreciation of the value of\nMr Wilson's note on the Uncertainty principle. A scientific hypothesis\nmay be worth making without being true. We must not treat as an\nassertion \" X is true \", a form of thought whose essential character is.\n\f176 Journal of Society for Psychical Research nov.-dec. 1945\n\" If X is true, Y follows \". Mr Wilson has pointed out various conse-\nquences of the hypothesis that E.S.P. displacement followed from the\nuncertainty principle. Amongst others, that the displacement of correct\nresponses would he normally distributed about zero. In fact, there is no\nneed for further experiments on this point since we already have ample\nevidence that this is not the case. So the hypothesis is not true. The\njustification for Mr Wilson's speculation is that he has put forward a new\nph3fsical explanation of a psi effect, and has clearly indicated experi-\nmentally verifiable consequences of that explanation by means of which\nthe speculation can be proved to be wrong. Few of those who speculate\non psychical research have done so much in so little space.\nIt we are to justify the proposition that E.S.P. has not a physical basis,\nit is not by saying that there is. no evidence for this proposition which\nmerely leaves the matter in doubt, but by thinking out all possible physical\ntheories of E.S.P. and proving experimentally that their expected conse-\nquences are not fulfilled. We shall do no service to Psychical Research\nby trying to discourage those who undertake the arduous work of exploring\nall the blind alleys which must be explored in an attempt to elucidate its\nnature.\nYours faithfully,\nR. H. Thouless\nSir,\u2014I was much interested in the contribution by Drayton Thomas in\nthe June issue of the Journal. In my experience of trance sittings with\nMrs Edith Thomson during the past ten years I have observed many\nthings which support his comments.\nOn the question of evidence of identity, too much stress cannot be laid\non the compelling nature of the evidence when it portrays fully a person-\nality unknown to the medium. Personality is a complex affair. It may\nbe shown physically by gesture of the hands, by shrug of the shoulders,\nby movements of the head or parts of it; it may be shown mentally by\nknowledge of facts, by dialect, by idiom ; it may be shown spiritually by\nvivacity, by sensitiveness and so on. Each of these is subtle and capable\nof infinite shading. The sum of them makes up the personality of the\nhuman being; and the variety of the ingredients is testified to by our\ncommon experience that no two persons arc alike. We have no difficulty\nin identifying our acquaintances from their personalities. Hence in the\nseance room, the sense of conviction of the presence of a communicator is\noverwhelming when that communicator is known to the sitter and the\npersonahty is vividly portrayed. When, during the course of a sitting,\na dozen or more personalities of known communicators are accurately\ntransmitted, the effect is correspondingly enhanced. I have had over a\nhundred such sittings, and so have had many friends of mine.\nUnfortunately, such evidence of identity must by its nature be personal\nto the sitter. It cannot be assessed quantitatively, nor can it be conveyed\nadequately in print. A Society such as ours must concentrate more on\nthe accumulation of evidence of a particular type, such as the production\nthrough a medium of facts unknown to himself or herself and preferably\nunknown to the sitter. To a person whose conviction of identity has been\nachieved by the rich path of recognition of personality it seems a desolate\n\fNOV.-DEC. 1945 Correspondence 177\nundertaking to submit factual evidence in support of that conviction. Few\nof those who have received conviction have the training to report their\nfactual evidence ; still fewer have the inclination to do so.\nAll this is written not to minimize the importance of the Society's work\nin collecting evidence. It is a duty to continue to do so. Rather is this\nwritten to emphasize the importance to the individual of evidence of per-\nsonality. It has a practical bearing on conduct at sittings. Notwith-\nstanding the advice of experienced sitters, there are honest enquirers who\napproach the delicate atmosphere of a sitting so intent on giving nothing\naway factually that they destroy any chance of obtaining the personally\nricher evidence of personality. If they thought of it, they would see that\npersonality becomes fully evident only during free intercourse and would\nbecome rapidly quenched if one party indulged only in monosyllabic\nreplies. Further, the experienced sitter knows that the best evidence is\nthat obtained spontaneously, that is, the kind that slips out unintentionally\nby the communicator. There is then an absence of those conditions of\nstrain or anxiety which are apt to be fatal to good transmission.\nI am glad to see, further, that Drayton Thomas has devised a method of\nindicating by italics followed by (D.V.), a phenomenon which I have\nfrequently observed. The \" distance \" between communicator and\ncontrol is a continuous variable according to the conditions ; when these\nare good, and intimacy between communicator and sitter is established,\nthe personality of the control is often submerged and the sitter feels to be\nin direct communication. Again, when the communicator is not appar-\nently in direct control, a desire for special emphasis or the correction of an\nerror seems to produce the necessary psychic force to occasion a momen-\ntary taking of complete control. It is convenient to have a recognised\nmethod of recording this, though whether it is necessary to postulate\n\" direct voice \" with its implication of the presence of ectoplasmic vocal\norgans I am not so sure.\nMr Thomas's observations (p. 153) on the difficulties which arise\nthrough the comparatively more rapid rate of thought of communicators\nis very pertinent. This has been a grave source of misunderstanding\nbetween my communicators and myself on occasions before I realized its\neffect. During discussions with them, my slowness, on the one hand, has\nexasperated them, and they have felt that I was evasive or uncertain ;\ntheir quickness, on the other hand, has made me feel that they had not\ngiven sufficient consideration to my views. The speed with which a reply\ninvolving consultation between communicators can be given is quite\nremarkable.\nYours etc.,\nJohn A. Cranston\nA CASE OF PREDICTION OF ILLNESS\nDear Sir,\u2014The following example of precognition may be of interest to\nour members :\nI was intending to go away with my family on August 4 for a four-weeks\nholiday at Aldeburgh in Suffolk. On August 2 I went with Mr Percy\nWilson, also a member of the Society, to pay a friendly call on the well-\n\f178 Journal of Society for Psychical Research NOV.-DEC. 1945\nknown medium Miss Jacqueline, who had expressed a wish to see me.\nWe arrived about 4.45 p.m., had tea and talked for about an hour on various\nsubjects. Nothing was said about my health and according to my friends\nI was looking as I was feeling, remarkably well.\nNext morning, soon after I arrived in office, I was rung up by Miss\nJacqueline first and then by Mr Wilson. Miss Jacqueline seemed in a\ngreat state of anxiety about my health and begged me not to go away or\nat any rate before going to see a homeopath (whose address she gave me)\nin whom she had great faith. I thanked her for the interest she was\ntaking in me and said I felt perfectly well. I would, if I could, see her\ndoctor but as it was my last day_,before going away for a holiday I had\nseveral engagements and I doubted if I could fit it in. A little later Mr\nWilson rang up and told me that Miss Jacqueline had rung him up last\nnight when he was out and again that morning and said that if I went\naway for a holiday I should spend most of it in bed and begged him to use\nhis influence with me to prevent my going.\nI felt perfectly well and naturally enough went off to the seaside as\narranged the next day. For a week I played golf every day and continued\napparently in perfect health. On the tenth I wrote to Miss Jacqueline\nthanking her for all the trouble she had taken and telling her that I was\nquite well and playing golf regularly. Then during the night of August 1\n1\nI had what seemed a bad attack of indigestion. Next day and the following\ndays my temperature kept up and I stayed in bed. On the 17th a specialist\nwas called in and advised an immediate abdominal operation. I was\nremoved at once to Ipswich Hospital, operated on the next day and re-\nmained in hospital in bed for over five weeks.\nI am sure that Mr Wilson will be ready to corroborate these facts so far\nas they are within his knowledge. How are they to be interpreted? It is\ndifficult to believe that Miss Jacqueline foretold my being bed-ridden\nfrom my appearance. Otherwise, surely she would have said something\nto me on August 2. Her insistence of something overhanging me was\nsomething much more than that of one who thinks a friend looks ill.\nAbove all, her definite prophecy that I should spend most of my holiday\nin bed went far beyond a casual warning of impending ill health. In any\ncase I was looking very well, as I am assured by all my friends, and I\ncertainly felt very well myself. I feel convinced therefore that it was a\ngenuine prophecy based on some kind of clairvoyance\u2014I suppose that\nnowadays I should call it a psi faculty.\nIn some cases impending danger, if foretold, can be avoided. In my\ncase this was impossible. My condition was such that only a prompt\noperation could save my life,\nYours faithfully,\nB. Abdy Collins\nMr P. Wilson writes fully confirming the statements in the first two\nparagraphs of Mr Abdy CoUins's letter, remarking however that he would\nnot himself call the messages from Miss Jacqueline precognitive in the\nusual sense of that term : he would say that they were an excellent\nexample of psychic diagnosis.\nIn answer to enquiries by the Hon. Editor Mr Wilson writes :\n\" At the\n\fNOV.-DEC. 1945 Reviews\ntime there were no normal indications of impending health trouble with\nMr Collin*. He was looking forsvard to his holiday and I surmise that this\nwould have caused him to mention any feeling of being unwell or run\ndown or anything of that sort if it had existed. He definitely did not do so.\nMiss Jacqueline's message to me came as quite a shock.\n\" To my certain knowledge Mr Collins has not had a sitting with her\nduring the four years of my acquaintance with her.\"\nMr Wilson in his letter encloses a postcard in pencil from Mr Collins\nfrom the hospital at Ipswich, dated \" August 18 \" (postmark 18 August\n1945) in which he states he is to undergo an operation, and a letter dated\n\" 21-8-45 \" saying that the operation had been successful.\nAN \" OUT-OF-THE-BODY \" EXPERIENCE\nIn view of the keen interest aroused by cases of this kind, our members will\nbe interested in seeing the following report contributed in November 1944\nby Dr A. E. Duddington, late House Surgeon, St Thomas' Hospital, and a\nmember of our Society.\nThe following account of her experience was given me by a woman\npatient at St Thomas' Hospital some time at the end of June 1944. She\nhad been in one of the buses close to where a flying bomb exploded in York\nRoad, by the exit from Waterloo Station, and was brought to hospital\nsuffering from wounds of the face and mild shock. I quote her own words\nas nearly as I can remember them :\n\" The bus was crowded, and no one heard the approach of the bomb.\nThe first thing I knew of it was hearing a loud crack close behind me, and\nthen I felt myself to be high up in the brightness of the clouds. I hardly\nhad time to think to myself\u2014what does it all mean, when there came the\nrealisation '\nI am going to God ', and with it an intense feeling of bliss.\nImmediately after this I felt as though someone said to me :\n'\nNo, it is not\nyet time '\n\u2014and I returned to earth to find, myself in the wrecked bus,\nwhich I noticed to my surprise was empty. I got up and walked out of it.\"\nThis account was given me on the morning after the occurrence, when I\nfirst had the opportunity of talking to the patient. She was about 30 years\nold, a clerk in some office. She struck me as being a particularly sensible\nperson, and not all \" neurotic \"\n\u2014in fact, her mental outlook compared\nfavourably with that of several other patients who had been no more\nseriously hurt. In telling me about her experience she several times\nstressed its extraordinary vividness, and said that it felt as though it had\noccurred not \" in time \" i.e. that describing the phases as temporal\nrelationships seemed somehow not apt, and that she had no idea \" how\nlong \" it took.\nREVIEWS\nPoltergeist over England. Three Centuries of Mischievous Ghosts.\nBy Harry Price. London : Country Life Ltd.\nThat indefatigable investigator, Mr Harry Price, has added one more\nvoluminous book (400 pages) to the numerous works he has already pub-\n\fi8o Journal of Society for Psychical Research nov.-dec. 1945\nlished. And that book, Poltergeist over England, is a very valuable contri-\nbution to the literature bearing on one of the most important\u2014and also\nrnost enigmatic\u2014branches of Psychical Research.\nWe should of course carefully differentiate between Poltergeists and\nHauiitings ; and in this respect Mr Harry Price's new work is perhaps not\naltogether above criticism. For a few of the numerous cases he narrates\nare clearly instances of Haunting, not of Poltergeist, and some of these\ncases might, I think, have been omitted altogether (e.g. those narrated in\nChapter XHI and Chapter XVI). What we want in Psychical Research\nevidence is far more quality than quantity, do we not?\nSome of the incidents described by the author have long since enjoyed\nwide notoriety : such are the Drummer Poltergeist of Tedworth (1665) ;\nthe Epworth or Wesley Poltergeist (1716-17); the mysterious bell-\nringing at Great Beahngs, East Suffolk (1834) ; the manifestations in the\nhouse of the Rev. E. Eliakim Phelps, in Stratford, Conn., U.S.A. (1850)\nand others less and more recent, such as the mysterious happenings during\nmany years in the Borley Rectory, \" the most haunted home in England \".\nWith regard to the Epworth case some of the passages from contempor-\nary documents quoted by Mr Price seem to me to suggest that at times a\nrather prosaic explanation is not out of the question. (In saying this I do\nnot lay claim to any priority!) Could not the mysterious being whom\nEmily Wesley once saw running from under a bed and which looked\n\" most like a badger \"\n(p. 93) have been a big rat? Could not the \" some-\nthing \" which looked like a \" rabbit \" and which Robert Brown saw\ncoming out of the copper hole in the back kitchen (p. 95) have also been\na specimen of the same rodent, I wonder?\nIn the Phelps case one of the features of the \" manifestations \" was the\n\" construction \" of human figures with the aid of clothing gathered from\nall parts of the house in spite of the strict watch \" which was kept to see\nthat nothing of the sort could possibly happen \"\n(p. 27). This has re-\nminded me of a Russian Poltergeist case I heard about when a young man\nfrom Father C. I. Katchenovsky, a St. Petersburg priest whom my\nmother and all her family had known very well for many years. When a\nboy C. I. Katchenovsky lived for some time in the family of an uncle of\nhis somewhere in the Ukraine, who was also a priest. Mysterious\nhappenings began which were more or less of the usual Poltergeist type\nand which culminated in a \" doll \" made of clothing suddenly appearing\nbefore an archimandrite (Orthodox \" super-abbot \") as the latter was\nsaying prayers in the uncle's house in order that the manifestations should\ncease. The worthy archimandrite was of so exalted virtue a man that he\neven avoided looking at a woman's face(!): therefore the incident in\nquestion had an obviously ironical meaning as the \" doll \" represented a\nwoman. Such similarities are interesting and perhaps striking, though not\ndecisive so far as the question of genuineness or otherwise of the pheno-\nmena is concerned. I have been particularly struck by the comparison\nmade in different accounts of certain sounds of supposedly supernormal\norigin with \" the winding up of a jack \" : this comparison is made in at\nleast three accounts. But such coincidences, I repeat, are merely puzzling\nand do not much enhance the evidential value of the strange incidents\nthemselves.\n\fNOV.-DEC. 1945 Reviews 181\nOn the other hand we must not jump too quickly to the conclusion that\neverything observed was necessarily fraud on account of one or two cir-\ncumstances looking suspicious. I say this with special reference to the\nCock Lane ghost (Chapter^). I am inclined to agree with the author that\nEHzabeth Parsons (the supposed medium) was never in the strict sense of\nthe word, detected. The matter must remain sub diibio in this case as also\nwith regard to the whole of the Poltergeist \" infestations \".\nChapter XXVII on \" Poltergeist Incendiaries \" has reminded me of\none other Russian case at least where the same highly unpleasant feature\nwas prominent. If I mistake not, it was mentioned by me in our Pro-\nceedings many years ago.\nOn the other hand I must mildly protest in passing against the author's\ntendency to attribute a supernormal origin to such facts as the disappear-\nance of ships \" without trace \", with special reference to incidents occurring\nin 1880, 1893 and 1928 (p. 35) ; or the disappearance of crews, the ships\nsur\\aving {Mary Celeste in 1872 and others). Nor do I see necessarily\nanything \" paranormal \" in the spontaneous disappearance out of doors of\nvarious objects sometimes accompanied by mysterious detonations (p. 33 1\n).\nAt Cupar, Fife, we are told, on June 30, 1842, women were hanging out\nclothes on a common. It was a bright, clear day. Suddenly there was a\nsharp detonation and the clothes on the lines shot upwards and, though a\nfew fell to the ground, \" others soared up and up and vanished \"\n(p. 332).\nI shall require, I confess, a good deal of evidence to believe in such occur-\nrences, and I consider that mentioning them does not enhance the value of\nevidence for Poltergeists, but rather the reverse. By the way, in a footnote\non p. 332 Mr Price refers to a Wisconsin case when, it is alleged a tornado\n\" sucked upwards, on May 23, 1878, a horse and a barn of which not a\ntrace was ever seen again \" ; but as there was no tornado in the cases\nmentioned as having occurred in Britain, one does not well see how the .\nalleged Wisconsin \" disappearances \" suggest an explanation for the\nBritish ones.\nIn the chapter devoted to \" Poltergeist Mediums \" (Chapter XXII)\nvarious mediums beginning with the notorious Frau Maria Silbert and\nending with the not less famous Eleonore Zugun are paraded before us.\nI confess I looked upon Frau Silbert as definitively exposed, but Mr Price\nseems to believe in her genuineness. It would be as puerile as it would be\nuseless to deny that there is much resemblance in some respects between\n\".manifestations \" engendered by these mediums and spontaneous\nPoltergeist performances ; but it seems to me that such resemblance is\nwithin certain limits unavoidable whatever be the character of the phen-\nomena, i.e. whether authentic or fraudulent. On p. 249 we are re-\nminded of Mrs Samuel Guppy's famous flight in 1871 from her home at\nHighbury to a house three miles away. The connection of this extra-\nordinary performance with usual Poltergeist phenomena seems to me of\nthe slenderest kind ; and I do not quite understand what Mr Price means\nwhen he writes :\n\" Of course the whole thing was a swindle but this modern transit of\n'\nVenus '\n. . . was never proved to be a swindle.'\nIf the \" flight \" was a swindle, why mention it at all.''\nMrs Guppy's flight over London is shown by the way in a line-drawing -\n\fJournal of Society for Psychical Research nov.-dec. 1945\nby Mr John Hookham on p. 250. I wonder whether there are readers of\nMr Price's who are unaware that all these line-drawings in the book are\nsimply the product of artistic fancy. This ought to have been, stated\nplainly, I think. ^\nIn chapter XXX we find some considerations on the \" Poltergeist\nProblem \" from a physicist's point of view, by Mr Andrew J. B. Robert-\nson of Cambridge ; and some views as to how the manifestations might be\nexplained by Mr Percy Pigott of Kirk Ella, Hull. The latter communica-\ntion has especially interested me since Mr Pigott expresses an opinion I\nhave long since tentatively held, almost using the very words I might use.\nHe writes (p. 383) :\n\" I have read that Ann Bullen still haunts Hampton Court and that\nthe sound of her footsteps and the wail of her anguish as she fled from her\nhusband . . . are heard at certain times. Her form may have been seen, I\ndo not know. Is it not incredible to suppose that Ann Bullen has been thus\nemployed at intervals at least, for four hundred years? Is it in the least\nincredible, in these days of gramophone and radio, to believe that the\nsound of her distressed wail can be, and is at times, reproduced.\"\nI entirely agree\u2014provided (is it necessary to add t) that the manifesta-\ntions are genuine ;\nprovided also that we apply Mr Pigott's theory only\nto hauntings, since it is obviously quite inapplicable to most Poltergeist\nphenomena. It is no less obvious, I will note in passing, that this theory\npermits us to dispense with \" spirits \" altogether, which feature in the eyes\nof some persons\u2014not necessarily in mine\u2014may be an advantage.\nBefore I end I wish to add an account of the only instance when I found\nmyself face to face with alleged Poltergeist phenomena. This only instance\nexemplifies, I think, the major importance of not omitting in the accounts\nincidents at first sight unimportant and unsignificant and yet likely to have\nplayed a major part in the production of enigmatic \" manifestations \".\nHere is the instance above referred to :\nIn the beginning of 1903, I think, the St. Petersburg Spiritistic weekly,\nthe Rebus, published an account of some Poltergeist \" phenomena \" said\nby a M. Richter to have occurred in his flat in Reval (now Talinn, Es-\nthonia). I wrote him asking for permission to come and be an eye-witness\nof the occurrences, to which M. Richter\u2014a government oflicial, it turned\nout later\u2014readily consented, meeting me at the railway station. We drove\ntogether to the house he lived in, and that very morning, in full daylight,\nthe first phenomenon occurred, a small vase which stood on a shelf on\nthe wall suddenly falling down with a crash. There were present besides\nmyself only M. and Mme Richter and their niece (their daughter was not at\nhome\u2014or vice versa). I noticed nothing suspicious but attached no par-\nticular importance to the incident. Then on the daughter (or the niece!)\ncoming back home, the phenomena began to occur rather frequently.\nThey consisted of crockery, plates, glasses, etc.\u2014whether of the cheaper\nsort or not I do not remember,\u2014suddenly being projected into the air,\nfalling down and being often broken to pieces, but I noticed that all such\noccurrences took place unexpectedly and that the eye-witnesses did not\nknow beforehand the moment and the place of the occurrence. At these\nhappenings a good many \" observers \" were present at times since the\nphenomena were a matter of common knowledge and many people\n\fNOV.-DEC. 1945 Reviews 183\ntook interest in them. The very last incident deserv^es being mentioned\nspecially. I spent altogether some thirty-six hours at Talinn, sleeping\npurposely in the room where the occurrences were said to have originated,\nbut nothing happened there. On the evening of my departure M. and\nMme Richter, the two girls, an officer (visitor) and myself were sitting in\nthe dining-room out of which a door led into the room just mentioned.\nSuddenly we heard a loud crash. I rushed into the adjoining room and\nfound that a stone egg which I had placed on a table in the expectation that\nsomething supernormal would occur to it (as, I was told, had happened\nbefore) had fallen down on the floor. I picked it up and brought it into the\ndining-room. It should be added that I had placed close to the egg\nanother object so as to prevent it rolling off accidentally.\nSo far so good. There is, however, one little \" but \". At a certain\nmoment the officer and the two girls had left the dining-room, gone into\nthe other room and then come back ; the crash occurred soon afterwards.\nThe door leading into the other room was not shut. Would it have been\npossible for one of the three to throw the \" egg \" through this door without\nsuch a gesture being noticed? Undoubtedly, I think. Was I sure of the\ngood faith of all three? How could I? And so this circumstance annuls,\nstrictly speaking, the whole \" egg \" incident.\nIt is of course possible that numberless other cases of Poltergeist\nphenomena, too, were evidentially weakened by similar suspicious cir-\ncumstances\n\u2014\nsuch circumstances remaining, however, unmentioned. Sapienti\nsat.\nI will add a few more words on a possible motive for fraud\u2014if fraud\nthere was. The Richter family were living in a spacious and rather attrac-\ntive flat. And yet I accidentally learnt in conversation that Mme Richter\n\u2014and, I think, also the two girls\u2014were for some reason or other desirous of\nmoving to some other house. If deception there was, there was therefore a\nmotive for fraud, and in such a case it would have been interesting to\nknow how the idea of using so very peculiar a method for compelling a\nmove out of the house had originated?\nIn conclusion I wish to emphasise the great interest with which I have\nread Mr Price's new and bulky work and the gratitude which I consider\nall Psychical Researchers owe him for his unsparing eflForts to record and\nsave from oblivion so many curious and instructive incidents, of which\nsome may be after all authentic.\nPerovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo\nP.S. I wish to add that at my request the Fr Katchenovsky mentioned\nabove wrote an account of his experiences referred to, which account was\npublished without his name in the Rebus. I have not got it with me but I\nremember that among the phenomena he mentioned was the sudden\ndisappearance of money. By itself such a disappearance does not, I am\nafraid, necessarily suggest a supernormal origin, but, then, the money\nwas returned if the mysterious agency was requested to do so. This\nundoubtedlV looks more promising.\nP. P. S. .\n\f184 Journal of Society for Psychical Research nov.-dec. 1945\nThe Betty Book. By Stewart Edward White. Published bv Robert\nHale. Price 8s. 6d.\nThis is an interesting book for several reasons. It is not evidential in the ^\nordinary sense at all\u2014but claims to be a synthesis of teachings given\nthrough an unprofessional medium, and collected together by an American,\nMr Stewart Edward White, himself an author. The book has impressed\nme greatly in spite of its unprepossessing title because it is eminently cool,\nimpartial and sensible, but chiefly because it gives an account of automatic\nthought expressed by the medium through what one may describe as-\ninspirational speaking. Having done a good deal of work of this kind with\nthe late Lord Balfour I can say that \" Betty's \" account of the proceedings\nis an exact and accurate description of experiences exactly like my own. %\nThe technique is difficult and halting and does not involve real trance.\nCertain portions of my automatisms\u2014many of them no doubt telepathic\nin spite of the elaborate precautions taken by the alleged communicators\nto convey information unknown to anyone living\u2014have carried their own\ncredentials. I have hardly ever spoken of this series to anyone, as most of\nit is highly confidential. I have not yet made a prolonged study of the\nteaching conveyed, but in many ways, and those not obvious, it seems to\ntally with remarks in my own automatic product and in that of at least\nthree other people known to me. I believe many more exist and it is\npartly for this reason that I feel the S.P.R. should make an effort to\ninvestigate and to co-relate the various teachings, for it looks as if some\nunderstandable synthesis may emerge. Fresh light might be thrown not j\nonly on process, and methods of tapping outside knowledge and instruc-\ntion, but also on critical attitudes at the present time. It is my belief that\nmuch could be learned now by determined direction and effort on the part\nof the S.P.R. to study this class of paranormal product, basing its impor-\ntance not on evidential material, except of a general kind, but on possible\nexplanations of some puzzling inconsistencies due to sub- or super- ,\nconsciousness in the composition of the human mind.\n'\nEdith Lyttelton\nWitchcraft in England, by Christina Hole. B. T. Batsford. Svo, pp. i68.\nIn a clear readable style Christina Hole has outlined the beliefs and\npractices of witchcraft down the ages. Magic rites and their connection\nwith alien worship, good and evil witches and how they were detected,\nfamiliar spirits and prophets are all discussed.\nThe subject is not treated from the point of view of psychical research\nand no attempt is made to establish the reality of psychic phenomena, but\nthe book is none the less instructive. It shows how liable is the human\nmind to a horrible mass hysteria, in which the most fantastic beliefs become\nacceptable. Under its influence thousands of people indulged in strange \\\nrites in the hope of bringing about magical effects. Hundreds confessed\nand sacrificed their lives for their beliefs. For centuries the mass of the\npublic shared the delusion and countenanced unspeakable horrors in the\nname of justice. Such happenings have a definite moral for the contem-\nporary psychical researcher.\nMervyn Peake has added considerably to the interest of the book by nu-\nmerous illustrations in a style admirably suited to the macabre.

Mrs Sitwell on \" The Tibetan Book of the Dead \".\n7 Mar. 1946. Mrs de Beausobre on \" A Child's Perception : is it\nExtended Sensory Perception or a Mental Activity?\n\"\nANNUAL REPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR 1945\n1. Increase in Membersliip. At the end of the Second World War the\nSociety finds itself possessing the first essential for future success, an\nexpanding membership. At the beginning of the war there was a sharp\ndecline, which was gradually checked. By 1944 there was a marked re-\ncovery which has continued progressively during the past year, when\n93 new members and 3 student associates were elected, a greater number\nthan in any year for at least twenty years past. The increase in numbers\nnot only strengthens the financial position of the Society : it enables re-\nsearch and other activities to be carried on at a distance from London.\n2. Financial Position. The limitations on research and printing due to\nthe war have resulted in enforced economies which have enabled the\nSociety to increase substantially the capital of the Research Endowment\nFund. The prospect of a revival of research and of an increase in the size\nand frequency of Proceedings and Journal is most welcome, but can only\nbe realised to the full, in view of the rise in costs, if the Society's finances\nare strengthened by still further expansion of membership and in other\nways.\n3. The success of Mr Whately Carington's book on Telepathy and of\nMr Soal's broadcast are signs of a gratifying increase of public interest in\npsychical research, to which they have themselves, with other members of\nthe Society, notably contributed.\n4. Mr Soal reports as follows on the work carried out by him :\n'\nSince October 1945 weekly experiments have been carried out with\nMrs S. who with Mr Basil Shackleton obtained displacement effects in\n1936. Up to date ten sittings have been held and upwards of 4000\nguesses recorded. The general lay-out of the experiments was similar\nto that used with Mr Shackleton and the i\\gent and Subject were in\ndifferent rooms. Unquestionable evidence for ordinary telepathy has\nbeen obtained with three agents. Special thanks is due to one of these,\nMr F. Bateman, M.Sc, who has undertaken the laborious work of\ndecoding and entering scores. Though there is no evidence so far for\nprecognition there is some interesting evidence of an indirect kind for\noccasional post-cognitive displacement. It is hoped to continue the\nexperiments which provide ample evidence for telepathy but none for\nclairvoyance or precognition. Three other subjects have been tested\nbut the results were not sufficiently promising to justify a continuation.\n5. Several members of the Society have been engaged on experiments\nin psycho-kinesis, some of which have been reported in Part 170 of Pro-\nceedings.\n\fi88 Journal of Society for Psychical Research jan.-feb. 1946\n6. The Council have been glad to receive news from psychical re-\nsearchers in several of the liberated countries of Europe. During the\nwar our Society and the American S.P.R. have worked together with a\nsuccess that is a good omen for wider international co-operation.\n7. Mr G. N. M. Tyrell was elected President for the year. He de-\nlivered his Presidential Address on the 20th June, 1945 : it has since been\npublished as Part 171 of Proceedings.\n8. Changes on the Council. During the year two members of Council,\nwho had also been Presidents of the Society, died ; the Earl of Balfour\nand Dr T. W. Mitchell. Both had rendered to psychical research ser-\nvices of the highest distinction. Obituary notices appeared in Part 169\nof Proceedings.\nMrs Oliver Gatty, Mrs Heywood, Miss Bosanquet, Mr Denys Parsons\nand Mr D. J. West were co-opted Members of Council. In December\nMr West, who had accepted the post of Editor of the Combined Index\n(see next paragraph) resigned his seat on the Council.\n9. Officers of the Society. The Society suffered a very severe loss by\nthe death on the 30th November, 1945, of Mr Kenneth Richmond, who as\nResident Secretary, and for some years until June 1945, as Editor of the\nJournal, had rendered very valuable services to the Society.\nIn June Mr West was appointed Assistant Honorary Secretary, and in\nDecember he kindly undertook the task of editing Vol. Ill of the Combined\nIndex of Proceedings and Journal. As Vol. II of the Combined Index\nwas issued as far back as 19 14, no new volume having been issued when\none was due, owing to the financial position and, latterly, owing to paper\ncontrol, Mr West's task is likely to be neither short nor easy. An up-to-\ndate Index is urgently needed, and is essential for efficient research.\nWhen Mr Richmond relinquished the Editorship of the Journal, the\nHon. Secretary temporarily accepted the duties of Hon. Editor.\nMembers will be glad to learn that the Research Officer, Mr C. V. C.\nHerbert, who has for some time past been on active service in the East,\nhas come safely through the war and was recently demobilised.\nID. The Eighth Myers Memorial Lecture, entitled \" Psychical Re-\nsearch : Where do we stand.' \" was delivered on the 21st November,\n1945, by Mrs W. H. Salter. It has been published.\n11. In the November-December issue of the Jour>ial, the Council\nannounced their intention of issuing from time to time numbers of the\nJournal to which the usual rule of privacy should not attach. It is hoped\nthereby, without lowering the standard of the Journal, to interest in the\nSociety's work members of the public who do not read Proceedings.\nThe Council have also printed, in a limited edition, a pamphlet. The\nSociety for Psychical Research : What it is : What it has done : Why its\nWork is important. The pamphlet is not intended to make a wide popular\nappeal, but to be a convenient means of spreading a knowledge of the\nSociety and its work among seriously minded inquirers.\n12. Obituary. In addition to Lord Balfour, Dr Mitchell and Mr\nRichmond, whose deaths have already been mentioned, the Society has\nlost by death Lady Barrett, Canon G. H. Rendall, Mr A. W. Trethewy\nand the Baroness de Kakucs, all of whom had taken an active part in the\nSociety's work.\n\fJAN.-FEB. 1946 Annual Report 189\n13. Library. During the year 676 books were borrowed by Members,\n70 books were borrowed by the National Central Library for Students,\nand Members of the Society borrowed from them 15 books.\nIt is hoped to issue shortly through the National Book Council a new\nlist of psychical research literature recommended for reading, and that the\nnew list will for the first time give brief accounts of the books and articles\nrecommended.\n14. Membership of the Society. 93 new Members and 3 Student-\nAssociates were elected. The total loss from deaths, resignations etc. is\n40, leaving a net increase of 61 in the total membership, which now stands\nat 673.\n15. Piibhcations. Three Parts oi Proceedings were published during the\nyear, Parts 169, 170 and 171, and also the Eighth Myers Memorial Lecture.\nThe Secretary's sales to the general public amounted to -(^49 i8s. 4d. and\nto members of the Society \u00a3103 os. 4d. ; and \u00a343 i is. od. to members and\nthe public through the Society's agent in the United States, showing\naltogether an increase of \u00a3111 on last year's sales.\n16.

He was for a time headmaster\nof a pioneer school. It was in the psychology of education that he was\nespecially interested, as is shown by the titles of his books, TJie Permanent\nValues in Education, and Education for Liberty. From this it was a natural\nstep for him to adopt the profession of educational and re-educational\npsychology, of which subject he made an intensive study.\nTowards psychical research his attention was turned by a request to\nreview Oliver Lodge's Raymond for The Times Literary Supplement. He\nsought sittings with mediums under research conditions, and explored his\nown faculties through automatic writing. He was always more interested\nin the problems of unexplored human faculty, than in proof of survival,\nwhich he regarded as a hypothesis necessary from the nature of mind, but\nnot capable of being established by any canons at present available to the\nenquirer.\nIn assessing the data of psychical research it is necessary sometimes to\napply standards of evidence approximating to those used in courts of law,\nand on other occasions to use statistical technique : we most of us recognise\nalike the necessity for such methods, and their inadequacy. For Richmond\nthe inadequacy outweighed the necessity more heavily than it would for an\nenquirer who had neither his subtlety of mind nor the habitual contacts of\na practising psychologist. His habit of transferring to psychical research\nmodes of expression appropriate to the requirements of his practice made\nsome of his writings obscure to his readers. This is perceptible in his\nPreliminary Studies of the Recorded Leonard Material {Proc. vol. XLIV),\nwhere his method of approach departed from the pattern to which previous\nstudies of mediumistic phenomena had accustomed readers of Proceedings.\nThe completion of his very thorough investigation of the Leonard material\nwas prevented by a variety of circumstances.\nAmong these must be reckoned the many duties he gladly undertook for\nthe Society during the war, editing the Journal, conducting experiments of\nvarious kinds, and latterly acting as Resident Secretary. There were,\nhowever, two directions in which his great gifts were of especial benefit to\nthe Society. The first was in conducting the general correspondence of\nthe Society (apart from financial and administrative matters), and in inter-\nviewing visitors to the Society's rooms, both of them tasks requiring a\nhigh degree of sympathy, insight, knowledge, and (where the corres-\npondents or visitors are non-members, of course) unlimited patience. His\nacumen, and his charming modesty, made the discussion of a case with him\nat once a delight and an education.\nThe second, in which Mrs Richmond was his enthusiastic partner, was\nin welcoming new, and particularly young, recruits to the Society, and in\nencouraging them to feel at home there and to engage actively in its work.\nWithout the Richmonds' constant help the Discussion Groups could\nhardly have started nor have become so promising a development. If the\nSociety survived many difficulties during the war, and is now renewing its\n\f194 Journal of Society for Psychical Research jan.-feb. 1946\nactivities with increasing membership, no small share of the credit is due to\nthem.\nFor several months before his death Richmond was compelled for\nreasons of health to reduce the amount of work he was doing for the\nSociety. It is characteristic of his sense of duty and his consideration for\nothers that he did not forget, during his last hours of consciousness, to\ndictate notes that would make it easier for others to carry on work that he\nrealised he could never complete.\nEXPERIMENTS IN THE RELIEF OF PAIN\n[The report which follows was completed by Mr Kenneth Richmond\nnot long before his death.]\nIn July 1942, by the courtesy of the Works Manager I was permitted to\ninterview a number of persons engaged in war-time production at an\nengineering works : these were colleagues of Mr Frederick Knowles, and\nit had been reported to the Society that they could give evidence of the\nrelief, following a psychic procedure carried out by Mr Knowles, of pain\ndue to a variety of physical causes. These persons\u2014for convenience I shall\nuse the term \" patients \" throughout this article, without implying that\nMr Knowles is in any way trespassing upon the domain of medical\npractice\u2014were for the most part men of scientific training, and all were\nactive workers with an environment not likely to be favourable soil for\nfanciful ideas.\nThere were ten patients on the list provided by Mr Knowles, and I was\nable to interview eight of these, separately and alone, in a private room.\nTwo were absent on leave from the works and I received reports on their\ncases from others ; I was also told of four further cases of relief from pain,\nthe patients not being employed at the works but being known to the\nwitnesses whom I saw. All these struck me as being good witnesses and\ntheir evidence was clear and positive. In each case relief of pain was\nreported, and in five cases of chronically painful conditions there were four\nin which no pain had recurred over at least a period of some weeks. Pains\nthat could be considered \" nervous \" in origin were not prominent in the\ntotal of cases, and Mr Knowles reports that he does not usually obtain\npositive results in such cases. A case which appears to be typical of his\nresults was that of a rheumatic knee showing old and hardened swellings :\nthe patient reported that this had been consistently painful in use, and on\nmovement after rest, until he had had one treatment from Mr Knowles two\nmonths ago, and since then had given him no pain. No change had been\nnoted in the physical condition of the knee.\nThese results seemed to present a prima facie case for investigation of\nthe phenomenon, and Mr Knowles has now been treating patients under\nmedical and S.P.R. observation for more than a year, a detailed contem-\npory record being kept of the effects obtained. Before reporting upon\nthese, it may be as well to outline the procedure which Mr Knowles\nemploys, and it will be of interest to have his own brief account of the\nmethod and of the steps by which he arrived at it.\n\" Several years ago I began to try an Indian method of psychic healing,\nwherein I laid on hands and concentrated my mind on the desired cure, or\n\fJAN.-FEB. 1946 Experiments w the Relief of Pain 195\nmade passes with my hands over the patient's body, without contact,\nwhilst concentrating similarly. I found most cases of painful disease\nbecame painless by this process, sometimes temporarily, and sometimes,\nespecially after repeated efforts, permanently.\n\" When I had cases of obstinate disease, where pain had regularly\nrecurred after each temporary relief given by this process, I tried variations\nof the process, hoping to make it more eifective. I also wanted to know\nwhether any parts of the process were inessential in order to attend more\nto the essential parts. Thus it became apparent that the laying on of hands\nand tjie passes were superfluous. By omitting them, and attending only\nto my intense concentration of mind, the process seemed to become even\nmore rapidly eifective.\n\" As the patient's expectation of relief is said to be an important factor,\nI then made trials without concentrating my mind, and just waited for a\nfew minutes for the patient to become painless in my presence. But little\nor no relief came, even in cases where the patient had been accustomed to\nget regular rapid temporary relief at every previous visit when I had used\nconcentration. After such futile waiting, a brief effort of the usual con-\ncentration brought the usual relief. As the patient was not told whether I\nwas concentrating or not, I think the concentration may act in an extra-\nsensory manner.\n\" The pain relief is sometimes accompanied or followed by other favour-\nable changes in the patient's condition, but usually these changes follow\nwith delay.\n\" The process has been tried with success on several hundred human\nbeings, and on a few animals.\"\nFrederick Knowles\nIt should be added as a matter of observation that Mr Knowles does not\napply verbal suggestion and does nothing to give visible or audible sign of\nthe mental concentration of which he speaks above. After enquiring from\nthe patient as to the nature of the pain and the area in which it is felt, he\nmay go so far as to say in a non-committal tone, \" Well, we'll see what we\ncan do \"\n;\noften, he makes no remark. There is no preliminary instruc-\ntions to the patient as to the attitude of mind he should adopt ;\nonly, in\nsome cases, the advice to sit quietly and at ease. Mr Knowles expresses the\nopinion that faith on the part of the patient is not a requisite, and, if any-\nthing, prefers a sceptical attitude. His own demeanour is calm and\nunimpressive and this naturally induces a quiet and passive attitude in the\npatient. Mr Knowles reports that he seldom has success with pains of\npsycho-neurotic origin.\nDuring a \" treatment \", so to describe a period of concentration usually\nlasting about two minutes, there is silence, Mr Knowles usually stands a\nfew feet from the patient gazing somewhat abstractedly in his direction,\nand to all appearances nothing whatever is happening. After this he\nenquires whether the pain is now felt and in what degree, sometimes\nasking the patient to rise from his seat, walk a few steps, or perform any\nmovement that previously was painful. Further \" treatments \" are given\naccording to the result reported by the patient, usually from three to five at\none visit. If the pain has been abolished, the patient is asked to call again\n\f196 Journal of Society for Psychical Research jan.-feb. 1946\nthe following week and report to what extent the relief has lasted. If relief\nhas been only partial, or has not occurred, the patient is also asked to\nreturn in a week's time. If no clear result is obtained after about three\nweeks the case is usually abandoned. When relief continues to be only\npartial, or pain continues to recur after a shorter or longer period of relief,\nvisits may be continued for as much as ten or twelve weeks in the attempt\nto establish comiplete and permanent relief. (It will be obvious that per-\nmanence of relief cannot be attributed to the treatment in the case of\nconditions such as lumbago and sciatica which clear up spontaneously after\na tirrie ; it is another matter with conditions such as osteo-arthritis, in\nwhich physical impairment persists and the continuance of pain would\nnormally be expected. Actually, complaints like sciatica seem much less\nresponsive to the treatment that those in which there is a manifest physical\ncause of pain.)\nObservations have been conducted for more than a year under the\nsurveillance of Dr Morna Rawlins, and for the most part at her house in\nDevonshire Place, where there are no steps for infirm patients to negotiate,\nand where Dr Rawlins has very kindly put a ground floor room at the\ndisposal of the Society for one evening a week, with service and heating.\nIn each case notes are taken upon a printed form on which the patient has\nfirst recorded details about his complaint and any medical and hospital\ntreatment that he has had. Record is kept of the duration of each brief\n\" treatment \" and of its effect as reported by the patient. Patients who\nshow any hesitation in reporting negative results are encouraged by Mr\nKnowles to speak quite frankly and objectively : as a rule this frankness is\nobserved spontaneously, and in general the atmosphere of the investigation\nis that of a research experiment. There is seldom any talk between\npatients, and no more comment is made upon a success than a brief remark\nsuch as \" Good! \" uttered in an impersonal tone by Mr Knowles. It will\nbe seen that the procedure is not of a kind to build up a feeling of expecta-\ntion or to foster suggestion through sensory channels. The calm and\nsilence that obtain during a \" treatment \" may be favourable to the\noccurrence of telepathic suggestion, and equally of induced auto-sugges-\ntion. But to make use of the term \" suggestion \" in either sense is merely\nto afiix a label to the phenomenon and does nothing to explain its operation.\nIt seems probable that the word \" suggestion \" as commonly used is an\nomnibus term for the results produced by several different psychic\nprocesses, singly or in combination, and the effect apparently produced\nby Mr Knowles's process of concentration gives some hint of a specific form\nof mental action underlying the various empirical techniques of suggestion-\ntherapy. Mr Knowles's habit of eliminating techniques and getting his\neffect without them may do something to elucidate this underlying factor.\nThe cases now to be mentioned do not include those described at the\nbeginning of this paper, nor various others concerning which we have oral\nor documentary evidence but no record of direct observation before, during\nand after treatment. The figures to be given refer to forty-three cases\ntreated at 31 Tavistock Square or at Dr Rawlins's house, 28 Devonshire\nPlace, with an observer in attendance taking notes in the manner which has\nalready been described.\nOf these forty-three patients, thirty-five reported either that a painful\n\fJAN.-FEB. 1946 Experiments in the Relief of Pain \"\n197\ncondition was relieved at the time of treatment or that a chronically\nrecurrent pain ceased to recur after a greater or less number of treatments.\nIn two cases no relief was noted, and six cases have been classed as inde-\nterminate, either because the relief, if any, was not such as to give rise to a\npositive statement from the patient, or because the connexion between\ntreatment and subsequent relief appeared to be doubtful.\nOf the thirty-five cases in which relief was reported there were five in\nwhich it was relatively transient\u2014lasting, that is, for a period between a\nfew hours and a couple of days in the patient's estimate ; twelve in which\nrelief was said to have lasted for more than two days but did not show\npromise of becoming permanently established ; and thirteen in which\nfreedom from pain appeared to become established, so far as continued\nobservation was possible. This cannot be taken as a reliable figure to\nrepresent cases of permanent relief, but it fairly represents the cases in\nwhich patients themselves appeared satisfied that a \" cure \" of the painful\ncondition had been effected.\nIt may be noted that the value very naturally set by patients upon a\n\" cure \", in the sense of the permanent aboHtion of the specific pain, tends\nto obscure their memory of occasions when they reported definite but only\ntempoi^ary relief. It is not uncommon for a patient who has reported\ndefinite relief from pain on several occasions, as is shown by the record of\nhis remarks and reactions at the time, to express the opinion later, if the\neffect has proved transient, that no relief occurred. There appears to be a\na natural tendency of the mind to think in terms of \" cure \" and to \u00a3.cel that\ntransient relief does not count.\nOn the other hand, the question arises whether, in reporting transient\nrelief, patients may not have let their imaginations run with their hopes and\nwishes, or merely given a polite and encouraging response. The impres-\nsion of the observers has been that this is not so, and that patients have\ngiven an objective account of their actual sensations. It is also to be noted\nthat in most of the cases under observation the pains involved have been\npretty severe, so that there could not be much doubt whether they were\nrelieved or not, and that in many cases of pain on attempting particular\nmovements it was a matter of visible evidence that movement was freed\nafter a treatment and could be carried out without reactions indicating the\ntwinges of pain.\nIt has been surprisingly difficult to collect suitable cases for treatment :\ncases, that is, in which the pain seems definitely referable to a physical\ncause and the patient is able to attend under the required conditions of\nobservation. It is natural, however, that there should not be very many\npatients available who are suffering pain from an identifiable physical cause\nand are not under some kind of medical treatment, and it is necessary for\nclear results to deal with cases in which improvement cannot alternatively\nbe put down to another treatment which is being applied over the same\nperiod. This has given us a fairly high proportion of obstinate ailments of\nlong standing, for which medicine has done what it could and apparently\ncan do no more, such as chronic rheumatism and arthritis.\nNine cases of arthritis and eight of rheumatism furnish groups just large\nenough to suggest the probable incidence of relief in these two conditions :\nin each group seven patients reported definite relief of pain, and each\n\f198 Journal of Society for Psychical Research jan.-feb. 1946\ngroup contains three cases in which rehef appears to be permanent so far\nas observation has gone. It seems permissible to consider these two\ntogether as representing a class of ailm.ent in which the prospect of relief is\ngood under Mr Knowles's procedure. It has been mentioned that sciatica\ndoes not seem to respond so well to the treatment, and relief when it is\nobtained appears to be fugitive. Figures are not sufficient for a clear\nopinion on this point, but sciatica can suitably be grouped with lumbago\nand various kinds of neuritis : all these Mr Knowles reports to be among\nhis less satisfactory cases, and when they do clear up after treatment there\nis little to suggest that they would not have done so spontaneously. Other\nailments have been too miscellaneous to furnish groups about which any\nuseful inference could be drawn, but a general impression has grown\namong the observers that the more the pain is focused upon some definite\nphysical lesion, the more likely it is that relief will be given. This may\nsuggest that the effect produced is primarily one of decongestion, a point\nto which we shall have occasion to return in connexion with experiments\non induced pains.\nTwo particular cases may be cited, in which opportunity for observation\nhas been especially complete. The first is the case of Mrs Tolhurst, wife\nof the caretaker at the S.P.R. rooms, who has severe osteo-arthritis of long\nstanding, and has been from time to time, for many years, a patient at the\nElizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital, of which Dr Rawlins is the Medical\nOfficer. With the development of the complaint Mrs Tolhurst had\nsuffered an increasing amount of pain, and in September 1942 her condi-\ntion was such that movement of the left hip joint was always painful and\nshe was regularly awakened during the night by painful stiffness of the joint\nafter a few hours of rest. X-ray plates showed the bone surfaces to be\nbadly roughened and the hospital radiologist commented that the patient\nhad no business to be able to bend that joint without its hurting. There\nwere skiagraphs taken shortly after Mrs Tolhurst had reported the\ncondition to have become entirely painless since her second visit for\ntreatment by Mr Knowles under S.P.R. observation. At the time of her\nfirst visit Mrs Tolhurst was in part-time employment at a large canteen\nand was considerably overworked, which may have some bearing on the\nfact that the treatments given on this occasion had no perceptible effect.\nFrom her second visit onwards, Mrs Tolhurst reports that she has had no\nrecurrence of pain\u2014over a period of seventeen months at the time of\nwriting\u2014and has had unbroken nights. It is not certain in this case\nwhether the establishment of the painless condition owed anything to\nsubsequent treatments, carried out for some weeks to see if any improve-\nment could be effected in the flexibility of the affected joint. No such\nimprovement was observed (in some of Mr Knowles's cases there has been\nvisible evidence of increased mobility of stiffened joints, possibly due only\nto decrease in the inhibitory effect of pain), but the continued treatments\nmay have done something to consolidate the freedom from pain observed\never since the second visit.\nThe second case to be specially cited is that of Dr Rawlins herself who,\nmore fortunately for the investigation than for her own comfort, was\nsuffering in the autumn of 1942 from persistent and often severe pain in\nthe region of a fractured thigh, repaired with the aid of a thick steel pin\n\fJAN.-FEB. 1946 Experimenls in the Relief of Pain 199\nAvhich had been left in situ. Dr Rawlins, as a surgeon of long experience,\nmay be considered as good a witness as could be hoped for in reporting her\nown sensations and correlating them with a surgical condition. This was\nnot one of the cases in which at a given moment the pain was dispelled\nduring a treatment and thereafter ceased to recur, and it is not possible to\njudge whether the eventual clearing up of the painful condition was accel-\nerated bv the treatments given : but Dr Rawlins's experience, of the effects\nthat followed a large number of treatments, gives an excellent criterion of\nthe actuality of temporary relief. This was also very noticeable to the\nobser\\-ers, judging by the greatly enhanced ease of movement after many\nof the treatments. At one period the condition was complicated by sciatica,\nand the interesting point was noted that while the pain associated with the\ninjury yielded to treatment, little or no relief of the sciatic pain was\nobtained.\nThe question arises, from all these cases and others which Mr Knowles\nhas recorded, what the actual process of relief may consist in. Experi-\nmental checking-up on the effect of varied procedures is to a great extent\nprecluded when we are dealing with sufferers in whose interests the\nscientific approach must take second place ; and ip practice, all complica-\ntions of procedure are apt to deter patients from attending for treatment.\nIt is to be hoped that more continuous observation of patients after the\ntreatment may be possible through its application to hospital cases. A\nsmall group of S.P.R. members under Mr C. N. Richmond has carried\nout experiments, with Mr Knowles, to test the effect of the treatment upon\nartificially induced pain. Subjects had the circulation in an arm checked by\nthe application of the pneumatic band of a sphygmomanometer, a pro-\ncedure which regularly causes an increasing pain in the arm and hand,\nbecoming acute in a few minutes. It was taken as the requisite for a\npositive result that the time should be prolonged before the pain reached\ngreater intensity than the subject could reasonably tolerate. With one\nsubject and on one occasion this limit of tolerance was extended while\nMr Knowles 's concentration was applied : otherwise experiments carried\nout at a numbepof meetings of the group gave a uniformly negative result.\nOn the other hand, Mr Knowles reports some positive results from a\nsimilar experiment in which, instead of pneumatic compression all round\nthe upper arm, the brachial artery only was effectively compressed by\nmeans of a pad controlled by a screw attachment. It can be conjectured\nthat when this method was used the arterial circulation could make better\nuse of subsidiary channels under the effect of the treatment ; and if any\ninference can be drawn from these experiments it may be that Mr Knowles's\neffect operates upon the vasomotor system and relieves the local congestion\nwhich is concerned in a painful condition. (It is obvious that in the case of\npneumatic compression, with the arterial flow almost completely inhibited,\nthe treatment would be mechanically prevented from inducing de-\ncongestion.)\nOther possible conjectures may be that an element of spasm is concerned\nin the production of pain, and that a spastic protest, so to call it, of the fine\ntissues involved may be relaxed by the treatment ; and that interruption\nmay occur of the neural arcs concerned in the transmission of painful\nsensation. The last appears to be the least probable suggestion, but these\n\f200 Journal of Society for Psychical Research jan.-feb .\n1 946\npossibilities are not, of course, mutually exclusive. An organic process is\noften inattentive to our tidy preference for a this-and-not-that explanation.\nRecords which were made upon the printed forms, giving details as to the\nnature of each case and of the results observed, are on file at the Society's\nrooms and can be studied by members and by any medical practitioners\nwho may be interested.\nK. R.\nDr Morna Rawlins, who has read the report, writes :\n\" I only saw some\nof the Knowles experiments and practically none of the later ones but I\nagree with Mr Richmond's remarks.\"\nEXPERIMENTS IN E.S.P. \/\nMr. Cecil Welsh, of \" Beverley \", Poles Lane, Otterbourne, near\nWinchester, who has recently joined the Society, and has been conducting\nE.S.P. experiments, would be very glad if any members in the Winchester\ndistrict, who are willing to be tested for E.S.P., would get into touch with\nhim.\nCORRESPONDENCE\nSir,\u2014There are one or two points in Mme Lafitte-Cyon's article,\n\" Reflections on Mediumship \", appearing in the October ('45) issue of\nthe Journal, upon which I should like to offer brief comment. ... I am^ in\nsympathy, in the main, with the author ;\nmy own experiences during more\nthan forty-five years of continuous investigations being very similar to her\nown. Her remark that mediumistic \" mind reading \", as commonly\nnoted, \" can be bad, middling, good and, now and again, striking, though\nalways queerly limited \", seemed to me exceptionally accurate ... I should\nlike to point out once again to our readers, however, the enormous problem\npresented by such mediumistic \" mind reading \", from the point of view\nof memory [Journal, March, 1936). I feel that this difficulty has never been\nsufficiently stressed\u2014or met!\nMy main point, however, is in connexion with the experience, in which\nthe writer's dream seemed to be \" tapped \", in a mediumistic message.\nThis is a most interesting and suggestive instance\u2014strongly reminding me\nof an experience of my own, some years ago, which was briefly this :\nA young lady called on us one evening, and suggested table-tipping.\nMessages were tapped out, including a name unknown to my wife and\nmyself, but which we were told was the \" nick-name \" of a friend of this\nyoung lady's, whom she had not seen for some time. In the course of\nfurther \" communications \", it was stated (by the table) that this friend of\nhers had lost her position, and that her mail was being tampered with. The\nsitter exclaimed that this was \" impossible \", since she had been connected\nwith the firm for many years, and had lived in her present apartment for a\nsimilar length of time . . . However, the next morning, she telephoned\nexcitedly, to say that she had spoken to her friend, over the 'phone, and\nlearned from her that the latter had dreamed, two nights before, that she\nhad lost her position, and that her mail was being opened!\nHere, then, we have a case in which a dream (of someone we did not\n\fJAN.-FEB. 1946 Corresp07idence 20 r\nknow, and who was known only slightly to our visitor) came through the\ntable, as a supposedly veridical \" communication! \" This shaws us, I\nthink, how subtle and circuitous such \" communications \" often are ; also\nhow illusory, and how they often seem to depend upon the telepathy a troh\nfactor, stressed by Mr Andrew Lang. . . . This seems to me a thought-\nprovoking and instructive case, which I am prompted to send to the\nJournal, because of the analogous instance above mentioned. ... If any\nof our members know of similar instances, I feel sure that the Editor\nwould be glad to hear of them.\nVery truly yours,\nHereward Carrixgton\nSir,\u2014In her interesting, but all too brief, review of the Betty Book in the\nprevious number of the Journal, Mrs Lyttelton points out that the material\nit contains is not evidential in the ordinary sense. It is true that it does not\ncontain, for the most part, the kind of evidence now-a-days called\n\" objective \" , but it does contain internal evidence of a kind which is of\nthe highest importance for psychical research.\nApart from the more obvious features of the book\u2014its sanity and clarity\nboth as regards the author's style and the substance of the communications\n\u2014there are interesting correspondences between the way in which Betty\ngives out her material and the way in which Mrs Willett gave out hers.\nThe three methods described with Betty, (i) the speech of the \" Invisible\n\"\ngiven in the first person, (2) the emergence of words as if by dictation, and\n(3) reporting in the third person, preceded by the words, \" they say \",\ncompare interestingly with the descriptions of the Willett material given\nin Chapter III of Lord Balfour's Report in Vol. xliii of Proceedings.\nBoth the \" Invisibles \" of the Betty Book and the Willett communicators\ndeclare their ignorance and their need for experiment. Again, jMrs\nLyttelton points out the similarity with her own scripts. \" Betty's account\nof the proceedings \", she says, \"is an exact and accurate description of\nexperiences exactly like my own.\" It is doubtful, from the way in w^hich\nthe author of the Betty Book writes, whether he had ever read Lord Balfour's\nReport on Mrs Willett ; and he had certainly never had access to Mrs\nLyttelton 's private scripts.\nThe first step in investigation would be to find out more about the\ncompilers of this book ; but it contains the kind of evidence which the\nS.P.R. should surely follow up with zest. There is likely to be some divi-\nsion of opinion on the value of this kind of evidence : it is not the evidence\nwhich all psychical investigators want. There is a school of thought\nW'hich would ignore it in favour of \" objective \" evidence, that is to say\nevidence in which each experience of the subject can be shown to corres-\npond with a definite event in the external world. The evidence which is\nfound in automatic speech and writing is, for the most part, different. It\nis of a kind which, if watched with a patient and open mind, conveys\ninformation like a developing photograph. And it contains a still worse\nfeature from the \" objectivist's \" standpoint. It is interwoven with\n\" teachings \". This teaching in the present instance, and probably in all\nhigh-grade automatism, is not mere moral \" uplift \" : it is a recipe for\nadjusting the investigator to his subject-matter. Essentially, it teaches\n\f202 Journal of Society for Psychical Research jan.-feb. 1946\nthat progress in understanding the nature of the human being cannot be\nmade by the intellect alone ; the whole personality must be trained to\nsomething akin to inspirational perception if the problems connected with\nthe self are to begin to clear themselves.\nAll this, though really no more than common sense, is unacceptable to\nthe school which relies on \" objective \" evidence alone. This school of\nthought assumes that methods of research which are adequate for physical\nscience must also be adequate for paranormal science and can be carried,\nstep by step, right through the paranormal field. This, in effect, is to\nassume that the world to be discovered by looking into the human per-\nsonality is similar to the world to be discovered by looking through the\nsenses at the external environment. I can see no justification whatever\nfor this assumption ; and it seems very desirable that those who make it\nimplicitly by ignoring all that is not, in the above sense, \" objective\n\"\nevidence, should justify their assumption explicitly. We need to recognise\nclearly that \" objective \" research, as exemplified in experimental E.S.P.,\nis limited to the fringe of the paranormal, and that those who constitute\nit their sole court of appeal will remain for ever on the threshold of\npsychical research. Once this is clearly recognised in our Society, effort\ncan be justly apportioned between the limited field of \" objective\n\"\nexperiment and the wider and more informative field of automatic and\ntrance-like states.\nThe Betty Book illustrates, further, the superiority of the method of\nusing private sensitives, who are themselves co-investigators, as compared\nwith the method of examining professional mediums. That this method\ncan be extended to physical as well as to mental phenomena is illustrated\nby the second Appendix in the book. It is well to note this when we re-\nmember how sterile were the efforts of the former Research Officers of\nour Society in the region of physical phenomena. It is often objected that\nprivate and co-operative sensitives cannot be found. But how much\neffort has been made to find them.' We surely need not confess that the\nSociety for Psychical Research cannot achieve what private investigators\nhave already accomplished.\nYours faithfully,\nG. N. M. Tyrrell\nMr Abdy Collins also draws attention to the experiments described in\nthe Second Appendix to the Betty Book as containing \" data of great value\nto all students of materialised forms \".\nSir,\u2014In my letter on Dr Layard's paper on Psi Phenomena and Polter-\ngeists {Proc, Pt. 168) which was printed in the Journal for November and\nDecember 1944, I mentioned a paper by Dr Meier which I thought might\nconcern the case discussed by Dr Layard and which was printed in the\nZentralblatt f. Psychotherapie (1939, XI, 284-303).\nI have now been able to have this paper examined in a library in Switzer-\nland, and my informant tells me that it does deal with the case outlined by\nDr Layard, but that the whole incident of the split bench has been omitted\n\fJAN.-FEB. 1946 Revieio 203\nin the printed version of the story. It seems clear that Dr Meier thought it\nwise to omit the tale when publishing the details in the Zentralblatt, and\nthat our Proceedings is the only place where the story has been printed\n!\nYours, etc.,\nE.

(Published by The Theosophical\nPublishing House.) 9s. 6d.\nA Book of Real Fairies is an attractive publication with excellent illustra-\ntions of the Cottingley fairies, the first two of which were published by\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle in the Christmas number of the Strand magazine\n1920 and the remaining three in the issue of the same magazine for March\n1 92 1. Mr Gardner sets forth his evidence for the genuineness of these\nphotographs with a straightforward clarity which is impaired in Part II\nby long and unconvincing narratives of clairvoyant investigations. As the\nend of the book approaches, the deterioration is accelerated by amazing\ndescriptions of the ramifications of nature spirits and the like.\nMr Gardner makes much of the evidence of a trade photographer whose\nexamination of the first two negatives resulted in a verdict that they were\nentirely genuine. The photographer claims that they are single exposures,\nthat the fairy figures show movement and that there is no trace whatever\nof work involving models, etc. The views of other equally skilled photo-\ngraphers do not coincide. Double, or even treble, exposures can be made\nwhich are absolutely indistinguishable from single exposures. The very\nslight indications of movement in the fairy figures do not occur just in\nthe limbs or wings but are \" all over \" movements which would naturally\nresult from holding a camera in the hand when making exposures.\nThese fairy photographs were taken by two girls. The evidence for the\nage of the elder of the two girls (Elsie) is conflicting. Sir Arthur Conan\nDoyle on page 464 of the December 1920 issue of the Strand gives her\nage, when the first results were obtained, as 16. This age is confirmed by\na representative of The Westminster Gazette who made an investigation\non the spot, early in 1921. Mr Gardner on page 14 of his book gives her\nage, at the time as 13. There appears to be a general agreement that the\nage of the younger of the two girls (Frances) was 10 when the first photo-\ngraphs were taken.\nHow on earth could two young girls possibly fake photographs like\nthese? The reply is that such effects could easily be produced by persons\npossessing the necessary skill in photography and sketching. Apart\naltogether from the information obtainable from an examination of the\nresults themselves, the evidence in regard to the ability of the elder of the\ntwo girls to produce these photographs by fake methods is very definite.\nElsie was an art student with no common gifts. Friends who examined\nher sketches and paintings, when these photographs were first published,\n\f20-[ Journal of Society for Psychical Research jan.-feb. 1946\nassure me that she would be able to draw fairies, such as those photo-\ngraphed, without the slightest difficulty. So much for the artistic side\nbut what of the photographic knowledge? It would appear that at the\ntime the first photographs were taken, Elsie was employed by a photo-\ngraphic firm in Bradford! It is stated that she was engaged on \" spotting\n\"\nand it is difficult, therefore, to give credence to the claim that she knew\nnothing whatever of photography.\nA detailed criticism of the prints, in the absence of the actual illustra-\ntions, is beyond the scope of this review. There are differences in the\nlighting of the humans and the fairies, the pipes are grasped in most\nawkward positions for experienced fairies, whilst the humans, when they\nappear in the picture, are very obviously posing. A pity! It would be\nnice to be able to believe in fairies. Some recent comments by Bertrand\nRussell are particularly applicable to this and similar claims. He writes :\n\" It might happen that all the air in a room would collect itself in\none half of the room, leaving a vacuum in the other half. We cannot\nsay that this is impossible, but it is so improbable that a rational man\nwould disbelieve the statement that it had happened on a certain\noccasion, even if the statement were made by all the fellows of the\nRoyal Society together with the Archbishops of Canterbury and York.\"\nThe rational man will continue to be sceptical of the reality of fairies\nin general and of the Cottingley fairies in particular, in spite of Mr Gard-\nner's persuasive attempts to convince him to the contrary. Now, alas,\nthe scene of these fairy revels is built up with modern houses. The trees\nhave disappeared but the stream still meanders among the houses and the\nglen is now known as \" Fairy Dell \".

This account of the early\ndays of psychical research cannot fail to interest our members. Hon.\nEd. Journal].\nIt is curious to find history repeating itself after an interval of sixty-six\nyears. On October 29th 1879, ^ small meeting of undergraduates interested\nin Psychical Research\u2014a term (by the way) which had not then been\ninvented\u2014sat in LTniversity College to discuss the formation of a society\n\fMAR.-APR. 1946 The Old Oxford Phasmatological Society 209\nfor the investigation of the Occult. They were a chance assembly of people\nwho all happened to have some curious story current in their own family or\nneighbourhood which had puzzled them, and deserved (as they conceived)\nfurther investigation. Each had supposed that his own particular problem\nwas a unique one, and was surprised when he found someone else with a\nsimilar or parallel story. It was the discovery that there were so many such\ntales abroad, far more than anyone had expected, which induced the origi-\nnal founders of the society to form themselves into a club for the investiga-\ntion and testing of alleged manifestations of the supernatural.\nThis mentality was not at all a common phenomenon of the iime, for the\nlarge majority of my contemporaries of 1879 l'^*-^ been brought up in a\nstalwart Victorian disbelief in all things abnormal, and to profess interest\nin hauntings, apparitions, or premonitions was likely to provoke kindly\ncontempt from the healthy and normal undergraduate. The spirit of\nDickens's Mr Gradgrind was still abroad, and facts repugnant to common\nexperience or common sense were put down by a large majority as deliber-\nate inventions, or at the best cases of malobservation and careless reporting.\nStories like Bulwer Lytton's \" House in Berkeley Square \" were pure\nfiction.\nAs at that time mere ghosts were the most commonly discussed psychical\nphenomena, the society took for its title the queer word \" Phasmatological\n\"\nfrom (f)d(jjj.a a ghost, though it never from the first confined its investiga-\ntions to such apparitions, but was ready to take account of premonitions,\ncoincidences and inexplicable sounds or sights in which no ghost was con-\ncerned, in short, things occult in general. I was not one of the first eight\nor ten members, who were mostly undergraduates of University College\n\u2014\nthe first two chairmen of the society, E. Ridley and A. P. Keep, were both\nfrom that ancient house. But I was among the earliest recruits, as were\ntwo or three other New College men, and I find that I was present at all the\nmeetings from about six months after the foundation of the society, and\nonly the first ten or twelve stories which it investigated did not come under\nmy own observation.\nThe Phasmatological Society existed for about six years, and had four\npresidents, Ridley, Keep, myself and Dr Headlam, Bishop of Gloucester.\nIt petered out in 1885, mainly from two causes. The first was that the\noriginal group of men who had started the society had been scattered all\nover the world, and the second generation of members also, while a third\ngeneration did not form itself, because the Society for Psychical Research\nhad been instituted in 1882, and had rather taken the wind out of our sails.\nIt was such an important concern that our small local enquiries seemed\npetty in comparison, and most of our keen members joined it\u2014as I did\nmyself. Our Oxford meetings gradually grew less frequent ; communi-\ncations from outside correspondents were not met with the alacrity of\n1880\u2014it became difficult to send out emissaries to visit them and to\ninvestigate their local phenomena, for there were few of us residents who\nhad not become immersed in University teaching : we found that we had\nno time for excursions, however promising in the matter of occult ex-\nperiences. Dr Schiller and I made about the last of these perquisitions\nin 1885. Finally the last secretary \" went down \" and the box of records\nremained in my hands.\n\f2IO Journal of Society for Psychical Research mar.-apr. 1946\nThe Phasmatological Society numbered among its members a good\nmany people whose names are not entirely forgotten. We were not by\nany means an uncritical body, or given to accepting on inadequate evidence\nthe stories that came before us. Our records show that while we voted a\ngood many stories \" unexplained \" , in many instances we resolved that\nphenomena were due to natural causes, to hallucination or illusions,\npersonal or collective, to malobservation, or (in a very few cases) to prac-\ntical jokmg or hoaxes. I can only remember two instances of the last-\nnamed sort\u2014one a very elaborate deception practised on a whole family\nby an impish neighbour. Our investigations were pretty thorough, and\nour sceptical members often produced explanations that were ingenious,\nif not convincing, of narratives that seemed to rest on good bases. Dr\nHaverfield (as I remem.ber) had generally plausible doubts to urge, and\nDr HeadJam was a stringent represser of inadequate evidence.\nWhen VvC could induce any percipient v\/ho claimed to have been a\npersonal witness to abnormal phenomena to present himself before the\nsociety for cross-examination, we did our best to test his tale without\ngiving him offence. I have a ludicrous memory of one personal investiga-\ntion which never \" came off \". A country clergyman who had been\ntroubled by a wraith, came by invitation to University College in December\n1880 to be examined. Unfortunately he arrived just in time to see the\nwhole College sent down, including the President and Secretary of our\nsociety. This was the occasion on which Dr Bradley, then Master of\nUniversity, sent down the whole College at an hour's notice, for the\n\" screwing up \" of the senior tutor Mr Chavasse. Of course our president\nand secretary had not been of the \" screwing up \" party of criminals, but\nthe whole College, guilty and innocent were departing in a procession of\nHansom cabs at the very moment when our ghost- seer presented himself\non the steps. He lost his journey, and was not at all pleased.\nFrom first to last the Phasmatological investigated about a hundred\nstories in the six years of its existence, not counting cases where we could\nonly get second-hand evidence\u2014tales of \" what happened to my grand-\nfather or my aunt \". The correspondents with whom we dealt and whom\nwe cross-examined were of all classes\u2014the two most distinguished (I\nthink) were Dr Paley the editor of Aeschylus and Euripides who thought\nthat he had seen the family ghost of the Shrewsbury family, and Dr Bar-\ntholomew Price the Master of Pembroke. Narrators differed in the most\nstriking way in precision and power of lucid answer, but we never came\non deliberate inventors\u2014in the two cases of hoaxing, our informants had\nbeen the victimised parties. Our correspondents were about equally\ndivided between male and female witnesses, and ranged over every stratum\nof society from the head of a College and a professor to housemaids and\ncarpenters.\nLooking back on the whole bulk of our investigations, I have one primary\ngeneralisation to make. No genuine tale of the occult is like the magazine-\nstory, where the ghost, or the premonition, or the mysterious voice, be-\ntrays a murder, discovers a lost will, or reveals a hidden treasure of rose-\nnobles or spade-guineas. Any tale of this sort may be put down at once as\na \" fake \". I can not make out that any single apparition or phenomenon\nin our whole list had anything of that kind to reveal. Ghosts, as we came\n\ff MAR.-APR. 1946 The Old Oxford Phasmatological Society 211\nto know them, seemed to be self-centred in their ways, with the single\nexception of the class whom we used to call \" death wraiths \" in our\nvocabulary of 1880\u2014the apparitions of persons who communicate their\ndemise to relatives or friends at the moment that they are passing away\n\u2014\nor very soon after it. There are scores of such cases recorded in Phan-\ntasms of the Living, though I think that the title is a little misleading\u2014\nas many of the \" agents \" were apparently already deceased. We had our\nallowance of such depositions from the \" percipients \", some of them very\nwell substantiated.\nThis sort of communication takes us into the region of telepathy, in\nwhich generations of the members of the S.P.R. have been so deeplv\ninterested. But we had at least two cases in which the telepathy seems to\nhave \" gone wrong \", where the fatal message was not received by the\ndesired friend or relative, but by someone connected with that recipient.\nOne particularly well-authenticated case, when the persons concerned were\ninterrogated personally, was one in which the form of a lady in extremis\nappeared, not to her best friend, but to her friend's husband. He was\nawake in bed, and recognised the apparition, to him a barely-known\nacquaintance ; but his wife, asleep beside him, never woke, and missed the\nmanifestation, which disappeared when her husband roused her. The\ncoincidence of times between the death and the visitation was exact. I\nbelieve that there are parallel instances in the records of Gurney and Myers.\nIn several narratives given to us there was a visitation by the figure of a\nfriend or relative who was not dying, but in deadly danger by shipwreck\nor war-chance, and seems to have succeeded in sending a telepathic\napparition while the stress was upon him, though he survived. This type\nof deposition had some variants, when the \" percipient \" clearly perceived\nthe figure of the \" agent \", but the latter denied any intention of com-\nmunicating, and was in no special stress. Such figures the critics in our\nsociety put down to mere hallucination or illusion. But we had two well-\nauthenticated first-hand depositions in which our informants, in each case\ntwo witnesses, vouched for the appearance of a person who denied alto-\ngether an)' intention of manifesting to them. In one case there was ex-\npectation, in the other none whatever, of the coming of the apparentlv\nunconscious agent. There was no possibility of a misidentification of\npersons seen.\nAll these variants were exceptional cases, which led to much discussion\nand in some cases to cross-examination of our percipients. The critics\namong us often fell back on a suggestion of hallucination\u2014even of two\npersons simultaneously\u2014and were often plausible.\nBut these divagations on the part of the presumed agent were not com-\nmon\u2014more usually the communication reached a desired recipient. This\nwas on the whole almost the most frequent class of story that came to us.\nOccasionally there was, as a variety, no definite apparition but a premoni-\ntion\u2014a sense of unexpected lassitude and sorrow descending on a person\nwho had no reason to feel particularly depressed at a certain moment,\nwhich moment was afterwards discovered to be that of the death of one\nvery dear. Our critics suggested that some people are in the habit of\ngetting sudden fits of depression, that they forget them .normally, but\nremember them if any disaster chances to synchronise with the day of\n\f212 Joiinial of Society for Psychical Research imar.-apr. 1946\ngloomy feeling. I have had such unjustified depression myself on three\noccasions.\nPutting aside narratives of apparitions coinciding with the death of a\nfriend or relative, the type of story which reached us most frequently was\nthat of haunted houses or spots, \" fixed locals \" as we called them. Nearly\nall these very numerous stories coincided in one thing\u2014the haunting was\npurely objectless, the visitant showed no purpose of frightening, warning\nor instructing the unfortunate observer. The ghost seemed in all these\ntales to be merely \" earth-bound \", hanging about a spot where either\nsome crisis, perhaps a murder, had taken place, or where he or she had\nspent many years of unhappiness. As far as we could classify our haunting\napparitions, they were about equally divided between harmless figures\nwhich pervaded their habitual haunts in a quiet way, and distressful and\ndistraught figures which seemed to recall some long period of distress, or\nless frequently, murder or suicide. Occasionally they showed an agonised\nface, or a wounded head.\nWe were sent some dozens of records of simple haunting of houses, or\nless frequently of spots out of doors, where our correspondents declared\nthemselves to have had definite sight of supernatural things. Usually\nthey saw single figures, but occasionally two figures, and very rarely\ngroups of figures. In the last named cases the experience would seem to\npartake more of the nature of a pictorial vision than of a mere apparition.\nThe most surprising case of this kind which we ever came across was that\nof two resolute witnesses who were cross-examined in great detail by one\nof our most energetic members. The vision was of a whole procession of\nsemi-transparent figures passing along a high-road. But haunted houses\nand spots seem reasonably common, if we may trust our informants. In two\ncases we had depositions of three separate people \\Vho at long intervals of\ntime saw the same figure in the same dwelling\u2014one was a West of England\nmanor, the other a house in a northern watering place. The informants\nin the latter case did not seem to have had any knov.^ledge of each other, or\nto liave heard of the previous visitation.\nBut, as Napoleon was wont to observe, there is but a step from the\nsublime to the ridiculous. Of the hauntings which we investigated, three\ncases were not by human figures but by animals\u2014in one story a vast black\ncreature as big as a pony or a donkey was seen, which vanished abruptly in\nthe road. The second was (still more surprising) a white bear with small\ngleaming eyes; in the third it was a large shaggy creature more like a sheep-\ndog than anything else. The observants in these cases were respectively\na famous classical scholar, a schoolboy of twelve, and a Welsh J. P. None\nof them seem likely to have been under the influence of alcohol, according\nto their very detailed narratives. This class of story, though quite, in date,\nmodern, seems to run back to mediaeval tales of evil spirits in non-human\nform, like Mauth Dogs, kelpies, and phantom bulls or horses. But I think\nthey may also be scheduled as \" Terrors of the Night \"\n\u2014all belonged to\nthe dark hours.\nBut hauntings do not seem to be confined even to visible forms; we got\nsome cases, elaborately detailed, where mere sounds were alleged to adhere\nto certain spots or houses. A very odd one was where a noise, twice heard\nby our informant, like repeated slashing, with a cart-whip on a metal tube\n\fM.\\R.-APR. 1946 llie Old Oxford Phasmatohgical Society 213\nor gong, portended disaster in a certain house. And we have two cases\nwhere the noise of a galloping vehicle, in a lane or a drive, was vouched for\nby intelligent witnesses, who were positive that no actual horse-driven\nconveyance was anywhere near them, when the sound had swept past.\nWe were always very sceptical about uncanny noises, being aware of the\nstrange tricks which hearing plays with mankind, more especially at night,\nor on lonely roads through woods or moors, or in ancient houses.\nBefore passing on from haunted houses or spots, there is one remark\nwhich presents itself after a comparative study of all our cases. Haunting\napparitions are apparently, almost without exception, figures of people\nwho lived in comparatively recent times, or certainly not much over two\nhundred years ago. I never came across an apparition of a woad-painted\nBriton, of a Roman centurion, or of a mediaeval knight, or of an Elizabethan\nor Jacobean courtier or lady. Two cases of monks are the only figures of\nany apparent antiquity that we have on record, and both of these were\nill-observed and vague figures with cloaks or hoods, which may not have\nbeen monks.\nThe limit of age for haunters appears at present to be in the eighteenth\ncentury\u2014gentlemen in knee-breeches and ladies with high-dressed hair\nare on record, but Victorians and Edwardians are m.uch more common.\nAn ingenious Frenchman, who had made this same observation from the\nstudy of continental ghost stories, came to the conclusion that ghosts are\nspirits who are earth-bound for a varying term of years, according as their\nassociations with the place which they haunt are more or less vivid. After\nmany years have passed away they drop ofl^ in their visiting of the spot\n-where they passed some crisis of agony, or spent long years of worry or\ntedium, having something better to do than to terrify casual sleepers in the\nhaunted room, or passers by in the fatal lane. There is one house with\nwhich I am acquainted where a frequently seen form of a lady in widow's\nw^eeds, very clear at first, gradually grew more thin and transparent, and\nfinalljf ceased to \" walk \". It chanced that I knew the family\u2014as did\nMyers. Our records have several instances of the type of the harmless but\nearth-bound haunter, pervading for long years places in which he or she\nspent dreary periods of misery or unhappiness. These are quite as\nnumerous as the cases in which the apparition seems connected with a\nsingle moment of crime or violent crisis.\nWe have three very well-authenticated cases in which visitors in a house\nwith which they were unacquainted, and quite unaware that they were in\n\u2022a room connected with unhappiness, declared that they saw respectively,\nan old lady with a crossed fichu and diseased eyes, a stout old gentleman\ndozing, apparently in a state of senile deca)^, and a middle-aged man who\nseemed to be asleep on a bed, with marked features and much hair about\nhis face. In each case the figures were identified on enquiry from the\nowners of the houses, with persons who had spent some years in those\nrooms. Two were cases of mental infirmity, the third of long depression\nending in suicide. None of the figures took any notice of the casual\nvisitant. They simply remained quiescent. This indeed is the habit of\nmost \" fixed locals\n\"\u2014they are apparently unconscious of anything but\ntheir own condition\u2014if indeed they are conscious of that, and are not mere\nshells of ancient memory of unhappiness.\n\f214 Journal of Society for Psychical Research mar.-apr. 1946\nIn the depositions in which the haunter is said not to have remained,\ninert and motionless, but to have been seen on the move, passing a room,\nor mounting a stair, or sweeping along a corridor, there is in most cases\nthe same report that the figure took no notice of the percipient, but went\non its round\u2014not only when adjured to speak, but once when shot at with\na revolver\u2014this last is a first-hand narrative. There were, however, two\ncases in which the visitant is declared to have taken the initiative\u2014once by\nwaking a sleeper by a sharp slap, in the second case by leaning over him\nand giving him a burning and blistering kiss. This was in a historic castle:\nthe percipient could only say that he sav\/ the upper half of a draped female\nfigure, which passed away through a bolted and firmly fixed door. There\nwas corroborative evidence by a friend in an adjoining room, who declared\nthat such a figure had passed through his room and vanished through a\nwall. Both informants were well-knovm men; the depositions were among\nthe strongest that came to us.\nExactly a dozen of the depositions which our society investigated had\nreference to dreams. This was a rather disappointing section of our\nenquiry. The reasons are obvious. Millions of dreams come to the\nsleepers on their pillows. They are mostly trivial and soon forgotten.\nBut some are disquieting, and if a bad dream coincides more or\nless in time with a disaster of any sort, it is remembered, and per-\nhaps an account may go down on paper. Here is an example : a lady\nwhose brother is sailing for India has a tragic dream of a shipwreck, her\nmind being, no doubt, set on her brother's voyage. The brother reached\nBombay in perfect safety, but another vessel on which there was a different\nperson, in whom the dreamer was interested, was caught in a monsoon and\nlost with all hands, on a night somewhere about the same time as the dream.\nThe exact date could never be fixed, but to explain the dismal vision as a\ntelepathic impression of the shipwreck was natural. And as such it was\nsent in to us. Who can say that it was not mere coincidence ? Or a dream\nmay bring about its own fulfilment\u2014as thus. Mr A, a man of business,\nwas on the eve of signing a large contract. On the night before his signa-\nture was due he had a vivid dream, in which his wife\u2014dead a few months\nback\u2014implored him to drop the affair, or it would be his ruin. He did\nbreak off the transaction, which turned out to be a swindle. But was it not\nhis own subliminal self, doubtful about the venture, which warned him\n\u2014\nthe appeal taking the form which would be most impressive ? We had\nanother case, concerning the custody of some orphan children, in which\nthe dreamer was implored by the deceased mother to keep them at all\ncosts out of the hands of certain relatives. This was done, and the relatives\nturned out badly. But was not the dreamer's other self supplying the form\nof the suppliant mother ? Dreams to be truly considered veridical must\npass very close criticism both of date and of details. Many of ours did not.\nWe had one account of a \" levitation \" by a Welsh spiritualist ; it was.\naltogether too wild, and unconfirmed by any witnesses. Also several\n\" poltergeist \" stories of rappings, movement of objects, etc., which did\nnot bring conviction. For my own part I have always regarded poltergeist\nphenomena as the work of perverse children, set on mere mischief and\ngifted with some dexterity. We had a case near Oxford very recently of a\nboy who caused unaccountable fires in sheds and haystacks, and long\n\fMAR.-APS. 1946 The Old Oxford Phas'matological Society 215\nescaped detection. The phenomena are common abroad no less than in\nGreat Britain. The young agents often display considerable cleverness in\ncontriving alibis and employing sleight of hand or ingenious booby-traps.\nI ran on a very good case near Mantua, where household utensils had been\nflying about and deafening noises produced\u2014and the very name \" polter-\ngeist \" testifies to the German side of such manifestations.\nWhile the London Society for Psychical Research was largely occupying\nitself with apparitions and hauntings, in the days of Frederic Myers and\nGurney, I was greatly interested in its researches, and saw a great deal of\nMyers\u2014who was a neighbour in Cheltenham. I went out on several\nexcursions with him\u2014he was twenty years older than myself but an in-\nspiring comrade. I collected for him* some of the stories which are printed\nin Phantasms of the Living, and. a hundred cases for his \"Census of\nHallucinations \". About six of them needed careful verification. But in\nlater yeai^, when both Myers and Andrew Lang were dead, and the society\nwent ofl^ into elaborate thought-transference and coincidence statistics, my\ninterest flagged. I could not take seriously the interminable interviews with\nEusapia Palladino and Mrs Piper. Nor was I much impressed with Sir\nOliver Lodge's theories. Hence a gap in my touch with the occult, lasting\nthrough the war of 19 14- 18 and my sixteen succeeding years in the House\nof Commons 1919-36. The old box of the Phasmatological Society reports\nremained locked, till I opened it again quite recently, and reviewed old\nnarratives and some cryptic correspondence.\nAs a last legacy from the old Phasmatological Society to the new Oxford\nventure I may formulate a few suggestions\u2014rules familiar to the specialist,\nbut often ignored by the beginner in research.\n(1) Before filing a story as unexplainableand evidential, enquire how long\nafter the recorded manifestation it was written down. After long intervals\nof time the human memory is prone to round off a tale, stressing the strong\npoints and ignoring weak ones. Contemporary correspondence is, of\ncourse, invaluable, but not very often to be procured.\n(2) Discover, if you can, something about the mentality and the past\nlife of a communicator. I had almost said \" watch his future \", which\nsounds absurd, but means that subsequent doings or sayings of a corres-\npondent sometimes shake one's complete confidence in the depositions\nwhich he has sent in. I must confess that I find myself receiving with\ncaution, the evidence of those who develop into habitual witnesses of\nmarvels. And I mark with special approval that report of Andrew Lang\non B. House, when, staying in an atmosphere of the occult, where addicts\nwere seeing and even conversing with spirits, he refused to be led awav\nby mass-suggestion. As he pointed out, some of the \" visitants \" v;ere\nhistorically impossible\n\u2014\" the v\/rong ghosts \".\nI remember one of the correspondents of the Phas. Soc. who sent us\na well-documented report of an uneasy night, but in later communi-\ncations owned that he had seen at various tim.es a large unpleasant-looking\ndog, two veiled female figures side by side, a big blac'K bird flopping\nround the ceiling, and a tall man in a cloak. \" \/\/ y en a pour tons les\ngoiits \". On the other hand some of the most interesting depositions\nin the records of the Phas. Soc. were from witnesses who had onl}'\nhad one experience, and stood cross-examination upon it with complete\n\f2l6 Journal of Society for Psychical Research mar.-apr. 1946\nsuccess, dates and details being satisfactorily verified. Frederic Myers\nonce owned to me that he supposed, to his regret, that he was \" immune \"\nto the occult, for he had placed himself in the most suggestive spots\n\u2014\nwhere others had frequent experiences\u2014but could never get anything\nevidential himself. Frankly, I view with some suspicion, witnesses who\nsee \"too much\", and \"too often\". But there are plenty of a more\nreliable sort, whose depositions the objector finds it impossible to explain\naway by his usual methods.\n(3) A good many stories can be ruled put of the sphere of the Occult by\nconsiderations of malobservation, hallucination or illusion. When the\npercipient is expecting som.ething to happen with overstrung nerves,\nsomething often happens. It is much more satisfactory when the visitor\nto a haunted house or spot is completely unaware of its reputation. When \\\nhe does visit a sinister locality I have sometimes found that he sees the\n\" wrong ghost \"\u2014a \" lady in white \" instead of a \" man in black \".\nAndrew Lang in one of his more humorous papers speculates on the\npossibility of \" aphasia \" among apparitions\u2014that a vexed spirit might'. J\nmake an imperfect or illusory manifestation.\n(4) After going into dozens of cases, beside those in the reports of the\nPhas. Soc, I distrust the dramatic. With the exception of that class of\nvisitants who came on a special occasion to communicate to a friend or\nrelative a warning of death, or perhaps of deadly danger, (the telepathic\ncases) most Vv^ell-evidenced visitants take no notice of spectators, and go\ntheir rounds as it were automatically. Despite the evidence of traditional\nstories from Pliny's philosopher, through Hamlet, down to Sir Walter\nScott's \" Wandering Willie \", the visitant is not set on revealing old\ncrimes, lost wills, or buried treasure. Very seldom is there intention shown\nto scare or molest the percipient. Alleged exceptions are rare, and to me\nsuspicious. Beware of any resemblance to magazine stories !\n(5) Credulity and on the other hand a blind tendency to reject\nunwelcome evidence on a priori grounds are equally to be deprecated.\nCharles Oman\nA RADIO EXPERIMENT IN TELEPATHY\nOur Members may be interested to have a short analysis of the results of a\ntelepathy experiment, in which many of them probably took part, carried\nout by the B.B.C. on 17 October, 1945. The officials of the B.B.C. who\nwere arranging the programme of which the experiment formed the con-\ncluding part did me the honour of inviting my co-operation in their plans\nand of asking me to evaluate the results which I am permitted to print in\nthe Journal. most readers will recall, pictures of a rose and a skull\nwere shown at five seconds interval to a group of six agents\u2014three men\nand three women. The instructions to listeners were announced by a\nmember of the cast, who stood at a microphone seventeen feet distant from\nthe row of agents and was separated from them and the experimenter by a\nhuge opaque screen some ten or twelve feet high. The experimenter\n(S.G.S.) sat beside an official of the B.B.C. at a small table on which stood\n1 sloping reading desk whose slant side faced the agents. Against this\nsloping face rested a sheet of red and a sheet of black paper. In addition\n\f:\\rAR.-APR. 1946 A Radio Experiment in Telepnfliv 217\nto pictures of a rose and a skull the experimenter was provided with ten\nplaying cards\u20145 of red and 5 of black suit. A few minutes before the\nexperiment was due to begin, and while the iirst part of the programme\nwas in progress, the B.B.C. official thoroughly shuflied the ten cards and\nlaid them in a random order. On the agreement that red stood for rose\nand black for skull this order determined that of the presentation of the\nten pictures in the first or \" odd birthd\u00a3f}'s \" experiment. The order was\nrecorded -by both S.G.S. and the B.B.C. official in their notebooks. The\ncomplementary series was used for the second or \" even birthdays \" ex-\nperiment.\nThus : 12341^6789 ID\n\" Odd Birthdays \" : R R S S S R S R R S\n\" Even Birthdays \" : S S R R R S R S S R\nAs the announcer called out the serial number of the call S.G.S. lifted the\nappropriate picture of rose or skull from its place of concealment behind\nthe reading desk and exposed it to the agents for four seconds against\neither the red (rose) or black (skull) background on the sloping face. The\nlisteners were asked to leave no blanks but to write an R or an S at each\ncall whether they got any clear impression or not. They were also told\nthat there might be two or more roses (or skulls) in succession. At the\nend of the experiment S.G.S. extracted a promise from each agent that\nhe or she would not divulge to anyone the order of the ten pictures even if\nhe happened to remember it. At my request the postcards received from\nlisteners were sent direct by the B.B.C. to the Statistical Bureau of Empire\nHouse, St Martins Le Grand, E.C.i and the counting of correct hits,\nseparation of odd and even birthdays, and classification of guesses into\ncategories, were carried out by the Bureau. All incomplete sets were dis-\nregarded and an equalisation of the numbers of \" Odd \" and \" Even \"\nbirthdays was effected by randomly discarding a few hundred of the\n\" odd \" records which were naturally slightly in excess of the \" evens \".\nOwing to the fact that the B.B.C. needed the final results by 28 November,\nthe analysis undertaken by the Bureau -was of necessity very incomplete\nand owing to the expense being prohibitive no complete analysis has yet\nbeen accomplished.\nStatistical Basis of the Experiment\nBy m.eans of \" odd \" and \" even \" birthdays the listeners were divided\nultimately into two large random groups of 12,221 each. It was of course\nfully anticipated that certain of the 1024 patterns in which 10 guesses at\nR and S may be written down would be popular while other patterns would\nbe less popular. But it was reasonable to assume that, within the limits\nof random sampling, any guess pattern appearing with a given frequency\nin the \" odd \" series would occur with an equal frequency in the \" even\n\"\nseries. Hence, since the presentation series for the odd birthdays differed\nfrom that of the \" evens \" only by having R in place of S and S in place of\nR, it was plausible to assume that in the absence of telepathy or other dis-\nturbing factors the total number of correct hits on the even and odd\nexperiments taken together would be (within the limits of sampling\nerror), one half the total number of trials, {i.e. h of 244,420 = an expectation\nof 122,210 correct hits).\n\f2l8 Journal of Society for Psychical Research mar.-apr. 1946\nSteven's formulae could not be used since while these formulae recog-\nnise that people distribute tlieir guesses in different categories {e.g. 4R,\n6S ;\n3R, 7S ;\netc.) they assume that within these categories the guesses\nare distributed randomly which is far from being the case. Theoretically,\nit is quite easy to calculate the expected number of sets with all ten guesses\ncorrect on the assumption that people distributed their calls randomly.\nTo get 10 correct hits a person must obviously guess exactly five roses and\nfive skulls. Now in the whole experiment 11,577 persons guessed in the\n(5\u20145) category and as there are 1005 = 252 ways of placing the 5 roses it\nfollows that the expected number of sets with all ten guesses correct is\n11,577\/252 = 45-9. But actually there were 83 persons with 10 guesses\ncorrect. The discrepancy seems clearly due to the fact that the expectation\n45-9 is based on the false assumption that people are equally likely to\nutilise any one of the 252 ways possible of writing down 5 roses and 5\nskulls. As it happened the two presentations used in the actual experi-\nment were not unpopular and in consequence the number of sets with all\n10 correct is almost double expectation. But all the other observed num-\nbers also differ wildly from the expectations calculated on a false assump-\ntion of a random permutation of guesses in each of the different categories.\nTo get 8 correct hits, for instance, you must guess in one of the categories\n(5> 5) (3' 7) o'' ill 3) ^r^d the total number of sets expected with 8 correct\nliits works out at 1281-34 whereas the observed number is as high as 1425.\nSimilarly, there are wide differences between expected and observed\nnumbers of sets with o, i, 2 etc., correct hits. Even had we used 50\ninstead of only 10 presentations I am certain we should have noticed\nsimilar discrepancies though probably less marked.\nAnalysis cjf Results ,\nThe observed numbers of correct hits were :\n\" Odds \" \" Evens \" \" Combined \"\n61,155 60,005 121,160\nTaking the expected number of \" Combined \" to be 122,210 {i.e. half\nthe total number of guesses) we have a negative deviation on the whole\nexperiment of \u20141050. Assuming a binomial standard deviation of 247 or\none calculated by Steven's method (based on \" categories \") of 256, the\nnegative deviation is seen to he highly significant and exceeds 4 standard\ndeviations.\nHow is this negative deviation to be accounted for ? I think there are\nstrong reasons for suspecting that the \" even \" birthdays have chosen\nsomewhat different patterns from those popular with the \" odds \". If we\nscore all the \" even \" sets, not against their own presentation list, but\nagainst the complementary list actually used for the \" odds \" we should\nfind the total number of correct hits to be 62,205 whereas on the same\npresentation list the \" odd birthdays \" actually scored only 61,155 cor-\nrect hits\u2014a difference of 1050. It is not easy to account for such a large\nvariation except on the assumption that in some respects the \"odds\" must\nhave employed different average patterns from those of the \" evens \".\nPerhaps the very fact of the \" evens \" having to remain inactive while the\n\" odds \" were doing their own experiment may have caused the \" evens\n\"\n\fMAR.-APR. 1946 A Radio Expejimeiit in Telepathy 219\nto choose somewhat different patterns than they would have done had they\ntaken part in the first experiment. If this really happened of course the\nstatistical assum.ptions on which the whole experiment was based are\nvitiated and it becomes useless as a test for telepathy.\nIn order to throw some light on how the listeners actually distributed\ntheir roses and skulls over the ten trials of each experiment, a randomly\npicked sample of 1000 \" odd \" sets was taken and compared with another\nrandom sample of 1000 \" even \" sets. The numbers of times rose and\nskull were guessed in the 10 trials are given in following tables :\nTable (A) (1000 sets) \" Odds \"\nTrials :i23456789 io Totals\nRose 583 477 463 522 490 477 482 476 498 526 4994\nSkull 417 523 537 478 510 523 518 524 502 474 5006\nTable (B) (iooo sets) \" Evens\n\"\nTrials :i23456789 io Totals\nRose 570 487 441 522 466 460 496 527 438 484 4891\nSkull 430 513 559 478 534 540 504 473 562 516 5109\nA glance at each of these tables shows that the proportion of roses and\nskulls in the different trials is far from constant, and the most obvious\nfeature is that both \" evens \" and \" odds \" show a strong preference for\nstarting off guess No. i by writing \" rose \". The number of roses\nguessed then declines over guesses No. 2 and No. 3 to recover a little on\nguess No. 4.\nIf we consider Table (A) as a (2\u201410) contingency table we find x\" = 45'9\nwith a similar high value for Table (B). With n = 9 degrees of freedom\nthe values of P for each table is well below -001 ; in fact = 45'9 is right\noutside Fisher's tables. There can be no question of the significant\nvariations in the proportion of rose to skull on the different trials.\nBut I am afraid the samples are too small to show any difference in the\ngeneral distribution of roses in Table (A) and that in Table (B).\nA contingency (2, 10) table applied to the first rows of Tables (A) and\n(B) gives X\" = 9'0 which with n = 9 gives 0.5 > P > 0-3 which is not signifi-\ncant. This sample therefore does not throw much light on the question\nas to whether the \" evens \" and \" odds \" have employed different patterns.\nOn the whole 20,000 guesses comprised in the above samples there are\n9,955 correct hits\u2014a negative deviation of \u201445 which is not significant\nX though it is of the same sign as the deviation in the whole 244,420 guesses.\nUntil a similar analysis can be carried out for the whole material it does\nnot seem that much reliable information will be available as to the reasons\nfor the large negative deviation. If any of our members would be willing\nto analyse samples of 500 or 1000 as in Tables (A) and (B) I should be verv\ngrateful and would arrange for the cards to be sent to them.\nIn conclusion, I would like to add that I have every confidence in the\nmeticulous accuracy with which the Statistical Bureau carried out its task.\nTheir system of checking was admirable and the 1000 postcards which I\nchose at random myself and re-checked, did not show a single error.\nS.

Such, indeed, has been stated to be\nthe case in communications such as those recorded by the Earl of Balfour\nin \" The Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship \".\nIf the spiritual conscious and subconscious mind bears any resemblance\nto its incarnate counterpart this theory would help to explain the follow-\ning ghostly characteristics.\nThe ghost's state of mind. Haunting ghosts never appear to be in a\nhappy state of mind. Generally they are obviously unhappy and if they\ncan be identified tragic circumstances in connection with the life or death\nof the person represented by the ghost can usually be traced. This is\nwhat v\/ould be expected for it is not happy but tragic circumstances\nwhich lead to the formation of complexes.\nTJie ghost's intelligence. Ghosts appear to have a very limited intelli-\ngence. They are frequently described as moving in a dreamlike auto-\nmatic manner without taking any notice of observers or replying to ques-\ntions. At best they seem unable to make known their wants except in a\nvery incoherent manner. They give the impression that they are not full\npersonalities which according to the theory suggested here is what would\nbe expected.\nThe strength of the complex would determine how lifelike and intelli-\ngent the ghost would appear but it seems unlikely that it would ever reach\na stage of being able to speak on matters outside the complex of which it\nis a manifestation. Investigators should not, therefore, expect to obtain\nany knowledge of the spiritual world from it or, indeed, any true idea of\nthe conscious condition of the spirit it represents.\nDuration of haufiting. Haunting may last a long time and some ghosts\nhave been reported of people who have been dead for hundreds of years.\nIt seems incredible that these spirits should be earth bound for such a\nlength of time. Time values, of course, may be different in the spiritual\nworld, but an alternative suggestion is here provided, for just as many\npeople suffering from complexes in this world can still lead a normal life in\nmany respects so it may be assumed that the spirit whose ghost is mani-\nfesting is not precluded from functioning in the spiritual world at the same\ntime.\nThe spirit's subconscious mind would, of course, be unaware that its\nghost was manifesting, the only indication that anything was wrong would\nprobably be the spirit's inability to adjust himself to certain conditions of\n\fMAY-JUNE 1946 . Haunting Ghosts 223\nhis spiritual existence. Only when the complex was resolved, probably\nby some form of spiritual treatment, would the haunting cease. The suc-\ncess which Spiritualists claim in laying ghosts may be due to treatment of\nthis nature given by the circle and the \" guides \" in which the fact that its\nghost is causing a disturbance is brought home to the spirit. This is\npossibly a psychological treatment analogous to that in which a patient's\nrepressed memories are brought back into his consciousness by the\npsychiatrist.\nAnniversary and sporadic appearances. There is a traditional belief that\na man's ghost is more likely to be seen on or near the anniversary of his\ndeath than at any other time and that ghostly phenomena are likely to recur\nat annual intervals. This is a belief which is supported to some extent by\nthe facts, and we may assume that even if the spirit is no longer concerned\nwith such earthly anniversaries the subconscious complex may still be\nsufficiently bound up with the things of this world to be stirred into activity.\nWe know that the subconscious mind can keep track of the passage of time\nin a remarkable manner, and it may be that the complex is automatically\nstirred into activity when the anniversary date returns.\nOn the other hand ghosts sometimes appear and disappear without\napparent reason and such cases are probably due to some incident in the\nspiritual life stirring into activity the subconscious complex which accord-\ningly manifests.\nThe ghost's clothes. Ghosts generally appear in the clothes the person\nrepresented wore during life or at death. If it really were a spirit manifest-\ning it seems strange that he should still find it necessary to appear wearing\nhis old clothes, or even, as was reported in one case, a dressing gown.\nThis, however, would not be strange if it were only a complex manifesting\nfor the clothes would then naturally be those worn at the time the complex\nwas formed.\nGhosts of innocent victims. The ghost sometimes represents an innocent\nperson who has been murdered and the question arises as to why an\ninnocent spirit should suxTer while the aggressor rarely seems to undergo\nthis fate v\/Iien he dies. The theory here proposed while not explaining\nthe injustice does suggests that this is what one would expect, for the shock\nof murder might possibly affect the mind of the murdered more tlian the\nmurderer just as in this world an innocent person may be so maltreated\nthat his mind is deranged while the aggressor is not so affected.\nI do not, of course, suggest that this theory accounts for all the pheno-\nmena of haunting but I hope that Members may apply this theory to cases\nof haunting with which they are acquainted and let the Society have the\nbenefit of their comments.\nYours faithfully,\n.. \u2022 B. NiSBET.\n[Members may like to compare Mr Nisbet's theory with the view ex-\npressed by F. W. H. Myers in Human Personality, 11, p. 75 : \"I am\ninclined to lay stress on the parallel between these narratives of haunting\nand those phantasms of the living which I have already classed as psycho-\nrrhagic. In each case, as it seems to me, there is an involuntary detach-\nment of some element of the spirit, probably with no knowledge therpnf\n\f224 Journal of Society for Psychical Resfarch may-june 1946\nat the main centre of consciousness.\" The infrequency, however, of well\nestablished cases of Haunting Ghosts, of the kind specified by Mr Nisbet,\nmakes any theoretical account of them difficult. Hon. Ed. Journal]\nA POLTERGEIST CASE\n[Mr Ian Fletcher, a member of the Society, has contributed the follow-\ning report of his investigations at a bungalow in the Home Counties. His\nattention had been called to the case by reports in the Press. In accord-\nance with the usual S.P.R. practice in similar cases, the real names of the\npersons concerned are suppressed.]\nI WROTE to the owner of the bungalow, which was the place said to be\nhaunted, and asked if I might investigate the phenomena. Having been\ninvited to spend the night there I arrived at 5 p.m. on Sunday, 27th Janu-\nary 1946. The following is an accurate account of what happened during\nmy stay.\nOn my arrival I had tea with the occupants of the bungalow\u2014Mrs White\nand her grandson David White, aged 13 years i month. They told of\nvarious phenomena which had occurred since August 1944 when a Morrison\nshelter was installed during the flying bomb raids. The first thing to be\nnoticed was tapping on the shelter while they were inside. This tapping\nseemed to take the form of a tune and later it was noticed that objects had\nbeen moved from one place and put in another and then objects were\nactually seen and heard flying across the rooms. No one room was\nspecially picked out for these phenomena although the room in which\nDavid slept seemed to attract the most activity if he was present. Things\nsuch as clothes pegs, china ornaments and pencils were moved from one\nroom to another or might be missing for some time. The gramophone\nwas played by itself. On the afternoon of my visit David said he had\nremoved the handle and sound box but they had been put back in\nplace again. On more than one occasion the fire had been laid and lit\nwhile both Mrs White and David were out. A fire screen had also been\ntaken away from the grate and put in the corner while the place was empty.\nNotes had been written by both Mrs White and David to this unknown\nentity (referred to as Wily Willie by David) and replies had appeared,\nsometimes on the same paper as the note, sometimes on another piece\nwhich floated down from the ceiling. The reply was written in a peculiar\ncurly script and often with spelling mistakes. Sometimes notes were found\ndemanding that the \" gram \" should be played or there would be \" truble \".\nNobody had been injured by the flying objects but David had had his\nface slapped and small objects had sometimes hit him. I examined the\nnotes written by Wily Willie and obtained a specimen of writing from\nDavid. I was shown the bed in which David slept with his grandmother.\nThe paint along the side had obviously been beaten away. There were\nsome deep scratches on the rail at the foot of the bed. These had ap-\nparently been made by a toy car which belonged to David and which had a\nnotched wheel underneath it.\nDuring the evening some missing clothes-pegs and a screw-driver were\nfound under a cushion on the settee. I was told of many other similar\n\fMAY-JUNE 1946 A Poltergeist Case 225\nphenomena and that on one occasion the handle of the gramophone was\npurposely left in the house next door but was brought back without anyone\nknowing.\nAt about II p.m., after playing a few records, David went into the\nkitchen while Mrs White and myself were in the living room. We then\nheard two objects fall on the floor and the next minute David gave a shout\nand came into the room holding two pieces of lemon peel, which he said\nhad been thrown at him. A small toy aeroplane made of metal and\nmeasuring about two inches long, together with a piece from a draughts\nset, had been thrown across the room. At my suggestion David wrote a\nnote asking Wily Willie to do some disappearing tricks. This was left\non the kitchen table with a pencil and we all went into the living room and\nclosed the door. David, however, went into the kitchen again to fetch\nsomething and was away for about two minutes. When he returned, he\nsaid that a reply was on the kitchen table but on another piece of paper.\nThis note stated that some letters had been burnt and also told us not to\nwrite notes.\nDavid then said he would lie down on the ottoman in the kitchen as that\nsometimes caused trouble. I went into the kitchen with him and sat on\na chair nearby, with him in full view. About five minutes later the otto-\nman flew violently towards the centre of the room and deposited David on\nthe floor. He replaced it, and almost immediately the same thing hap-\npened again. This time I suggested it was left where it was and asked\nWily Willie to push it back again by the wall with David on it. This,\nhowever, did not happen but while we were waiting a crash sounded on\nthe floor behind David's head and a pencil box was recovered from the\nfloor. Having waited for about ten minutes without anything further\nhappening, we put the ottoman back in place and I stood at the foot of it\nwhile David lay on it. Again it spun violently into the middle of the room,\nDavid landing on the floor behind it. As I had seen this happen three\ntimes, I thought it best that we should go into the living room and I left a\nnote on the kitchen table, with a pencil, asking \" What else will you do ?\n\"\nWe waited for about five minutes and then David went into the kitchen\nso I stood up and watched the note by gazing at its reflection in a picture.\nDavid came back without touching the paper and we sat and talked for a\nshort time when David again went into the kitchen, and as I was in the\nmiddle of a conversation with Mrs White I could not see what was going\non, so decided that this piece of investigation would obviously be invalid.\nHowever, David returned and said the note was still as I left it\u2014un-\nanswered. He remained in the room for another five or ten minutes and\nwhen he again went into the kitchen, I immediately followed him, only to\nsee my note folded up on the table. (I had left it unfolded.) When we\nopened it out my message was seen to have been crossed out and under-\nneath it in the usual curly block capitals, was written ; DONT MAKE\nYOURSELF SEEM A MORE FOOL THAN YOU ALREADY ARE.\nAfter this it was decided that David should go to bed so he went into the\nbedroom, which adjoined the living room and undressed. Within a few\nminutes I heard some loud knocking coming from the bedroom so I went\nin and was told that it had come from the bottom of the bed. Just after\ngoing out of the room I heard some object clatter on to the floor and I\n\f226 Journal of Society for Psychical Research may~june 1946\nfound the cover of an electric light switch on again entering the bedroom.\nI took it out with me, only to return in a few seconds when I heard some-\nthing else clatter across the room and discovered it was the bottom of a\nflat electric torch. It was identified by David who was in bed during tliese\noccurrences. I went out and left the door ajar but was immediately recalled,\nonly to find the bulb and top of the torch on the spare bed. I took them\nout remarking the rest of the torch would doubtless make itself known.\nAs I was about to enter the living room, however, I heard a clicking sound\nso I looked around but could not find anything to account for the noise.\nI asked David if he knew what it was and he said it sounded like an electric\nlight switch. There was a spare one, apparently, in the tool shed and I\nalready had the cover of it. I waited outside the bedroom door and went\nin as soon as I heard the next sound, which was the torch case falling behind\na chair at the foot of the bed. As I stooped to retrieve it the battery fell\ndown at the side of the fireplace about a yard from me. I sprang up and\nlooked at David who was still lying down with his hands under the bed-\nclothes. Taking these two parts of the torch out, I assembled them all and\nreturned to the bedroom as I heard knocking.\nThis time I stayed in the room with my back to the boy but watched\nhis reflection in a picture on the wall. Suddenly a crash sounded at the\nfoot of the bed beside me and I stooped to pick up the electric light\nswitch, which had apparently been responsible for the clicking we had\nheard. The moment I bent down David's bedroom slippers hit me on\nthe back, so I asked him where he had left them and learnt that they had\nbeen under the spare bed (well out of his reach). I placed a box of\nmatches on the table at the side of the bed and asked for them to\nbe moved. No sooner was I outside the room than they were heard to\nfall the other side of the room. Having picked them up I chose a china\ncandle-stick on the chest of drawers in the far corner of the room and\nwell out of David's reach. This I asked to be moved while I waited\noutside. He called me back and I saw the brush and comb from the\nside table now on the bed. As I replaced them I remarked that the\ncandlestick was still in its place. I retired to the next room only to hear\nanother object fall ; this turned out to be a brooch belonging to Mrs White.\nI noted the candlestick still in place and went out only to return on hear-\ning knocking coming from some part of the bed, but nothing had moved.\nThis time I closed the door as I went out but burst in suddenly only to\nfind David lying quietly in bed and everything in order. Again I burst in\nand this time found a china ornament on the spare bed. I replaced it on\nthe chest of drawers and realised the candlestick was now missing, so I\nlooked round the room for it but could not see it. I felt on David's bed\nbut did not make a thorough search. Not being able to find it I went into\nthe next room to wait a matter of a few seconds when David again called\nme in and pointed to the missing candlestick on his bed. After replacing\nit I took the bottom of the torch and smeared it with vaseline and then\nplaced it on the table by the bed without saying what I had done to it. I\nthen asked him if he would mind my tying his hands to the bed as I wished\nto see how the knots could be untied. He consented to this so I tied his\nwrists to the bed rail with thick cord and tested the knots, and then asked\nWily Willie to move the piece of the torch. No sooner was I outside than\n\fI\nMAY-JUNE 1946 A Poltergeist Case .\n227\nhe called me in saying the left hand was free. The cord was still round his\nwrist but had come untied from the bed. I retied it and looked at the\nother knot (which was the side nearest the torch part). Again I was called\nin only to find the same thing had happened but as I was retying the right\nhand the left became loose although I saw it was tied as I entered the\nroom. I tied both securely and went out but within a minute David called\nme back and I saw the piece of the torch on the bed together with a small\nwooden board and also noticed both hands were free. I dusted the\nvaselined object with powder and looked for any finger prints which might\nbe there.\nAs the time w\"as then 2.40 a.m. I decided on the last part of my tests.\nThis- consisted of bandaging David's closed hands, separately, with a\nthree inch by six yards calico bandage, and then enclosing the whole fist\nin a large triangular bandage tied firmly on the back of the hand. I then\ntied a piece of rope round each wrist and secured it by three firm knots.\nThe other end of the rope was tied equally securely to the outer bed rail.\nNext I tied a piece of rope round each ankle and secured the other ends,\ntogether, to the foot of the bed. After testing all the knots, I placed a box\nof matches on the table on the right of the bed and asked for them to be\nmoved, then went into the next room closing the bedroom door behind\nme. The time was then 3 a.m. and I waited for five minutes and then\nwent in as David called me. One of the knots had become loose but not\nundone. I tightened it and found that it was just possible for him to reach\nhis hand with his mouth so I shortened the length of rope, making it im-\npossible for him to reach the knots with his teeth. I went out and im-\nmediately heard knocking coming from the room so I went in again but all\nwas quiet and as I had left it. 'The knots on wrists and ankles intact.\nAgain he called me and said that the ropes on his feet had been pulled\nviciously and that those on his wrists had been pushed up his forearms.\nI eased them back on his wrists and went out but he called me again in a few\nminutes. I saw the pillow from the left side of the bed was on the floor on\nthe right of the bed and all knots firmly intact. So placing the pillow on a\nchair I again left him alone, only to hear violent knocking, so I went in and\nplaced the pillow behind his head, telling him that was in case Wily Willie\ndecided to bang his, David's, head on the bed rail. There was more\nbanging and this time I found the bedclothes almost on the floor so I\nstraightened them and then found a small metal box in the bed which had\napparently come from the table at the side, although I had not seen it there\nbefore. No sooner was I outside the room than there was a loud crash\nand I went in to find the stone hot water bottle on the floor so I replaced\nit in the bed. As I went out David shouted and told me a pin had been\nstuck in him. All this time the knots had remained intact and I waited\noutside again for about ten minutes without hearing anything more, so I\nreleased him at 3.35 a.m. and went to bed in the next room. No sooner\nwas I in bed than I heard heavy banging and then some form of tune which\nI learned later was supposed to be God Save the King. After this some-\nthing crashed on to the floor and I went to sleep in the ensuing silence.\nI experienced nothing more throughout the night but in the morning\nwhen I went into the kitchen Mrs White showed me a note she had written\nbefore going to bed, saying \" Who is the bigger fool, you or I ?\n\" Under-\n\f228 JoiiriiaJ of Society for Psychical Research may-june 1946\nneath was written in the usual hand HE IS. This note had been left in\nthe kitchen and David was still in bed, but he got up a quarter of an hour\nafter me.\nI experienced no more phenomena after this and returned to London by\nmid-day.\nConclusions\n1. Early in the evening while I was talking to Mrs White, I noticed\nDavid get up and put his new propelling pencil behind a picture on the\ngramophone. About a quarter of an hour later he remarked that his pencil\nwas missing and after looking for it said he had it only a few minutes before.\nI then reminded him that he had put it on the gramophone and he said\n\" Did I \" somewhat puzzled that I should have seen the incident.\n2. I asked if I might borrow one of the messages written by Wily Willie\nalso a specimen of his, David's, writing as I should like to have them both\npsychometrised. I explained that this might determine the author of the\nwriting. He looked quite perplexed at this request but complied.\n3. David told me that Wily Willie sometimes announced his presence\nby a clicking noise. This was demonstrated to me but when I asked if this\nalways occurred David said \" Oh, no I \u2014eh, he doesn't always do it \".\nThe \" I \" was cut short immediately but was enough for me to catch.\n4. On examining the bed I noted that all the paint was chipped off along\nthe side nearest the head end on the side David slept.\n5. When David left the note on the kitchen table he later went out\nthrough the kitchen but did not stay in this room. While he was out I\nassumed he wrote the reply and then left it on the table beside the note as\nhe came through again. Had I, therefore, looked into the kitchen while\nhe was out I should have seen everything as it had been left with the note\nstill unanswered. When I later examined the reply I noted that it had\nobviously been written on some dark surface as the letters showed through\nas if written on faint carbon paper. I looked for an impression of the\nwriting on the tablecloth but could see nothing, so I tested this for myself\nby writing on the paper and saw that the impression did come through\nquite clearly.\n6. Most of the phenomena seemed directed against David rather than\nin his favour so I was surprised to see one note left by Wily Willie, at\nChristmas, insisting that David should be given an accordion.\n7. Another note was signed \" Polish lunetic \" but it was in the same\nstyle as the other notes including one signed George. On no occasion\nwas any Polish written.\n8. When David lay on the ottoman he pressed his feet firmly against the\nwall behind him and he had his knees well flexed. So all he had to do in\norder to move this piece of furniture was to press his feet hard against the\nwall and push his body downwards and outwards on to the ottoman. It\ndid not move once it was away from the wall.\n9. Later when I left a note to be answered, David went into the kitchen\nand shut the door behind him. As I was in conversation with Mrs White\nI did not follow him. However, when I later discovered the answer, I was\nunable to decipher the first word but David immediately read it out.\n\fMAY-JUNE 1946 A Poltergeist Case 229\n10. Shortly before going to bed David put a small paper book into a large\nalbum belonging to his grandmother, who asked what he was doing. He\nsaid it was to prevent Wily Willie getting at it. I thought probably Wily\nWillie would be blamed for putting it there, not taking it out.\n1 1 . When David was in bed and the top of the torch made its appearance\nI found it was quite warm, so was the switch and I presume they had both\nbeen in the bed.\n12. When I stood in the bedroom with my back to David I observed his\nreflection in a picture over the mantelpiece and saw him move as the\nswitch was thrown at me.\n13. When I asked David where his slippers were before they were\nthrown at me, he said they were under the spare bed. This would have\nbeen out of his reach, but I saw them a few minutes earlier on the floor\nbeside his bed and well within his reach.\n14. When I suddenly entered the bedroom the second time, without his\ncalling me, I saw him sitting bolt upright in bed with his arm outstretched\npointing to the china ornament on the other bed. I assumed the pointing\nposture had, a second before, been one of throwing. As the candlestick\nI had asked to be moved was missing, I purposely stayed in the room for a\nfew minutes pretending to be looking for it. I suspected it of being in the\nbed and was giving it a chance of getting warm. When I discovered it the\nnext time I entered the room, it was quite warm.\n15. I tied his wrists with rope but one came undone while I was actually\nin the room beside him. This could have been accomplished by his\npreviously loosening the knot and making a slip knot out of it.\n16. The vaselined article revealed a small portion of a flnger-print\nwhich was not mine, i did not attempt to prove it was David's as I felt\nquite sure without this extra evidence that he was doing all the \" pheno-\nmena \".\n17. All the experiments I had carried out did not seem to upset the boy\nin any way until I was about to bandage his hands, and he then seemed\nalmost frightened but assured me he was not afraid of being tied up.\nOnce he was securely tied, a much longer interval ensued before anything\nhappened and then I found the knot on the right wrist was loose and\ndefinitely wet where he had tried to undo it with his teeth. After shorten-\ning the ropes so he could not reach them with his teeth nothing more\nhappened to them.\nx8. The only things which occurred when he was securely tied were\nknockings, which could have been accomplished by banging the back of his\nhand on the bed rail, or similarly his head. Then the hot-water bottle\ncould easily have been kicked out of the bed, even with his feet tied, as there\nwas some slack rope when he pushed himself right down in the bed. The\npillow could easily have been worked across the bed by his body and, if\nnecessary, he could have aided its progress with his teeth. Although three\nobjects had been moved at my request, namely a box of matches, a candle-\nstick and part of the torch, the box of matches was not moved again when\nhe was securely tied to the bed. In fact nothing happened which could not\nhave been done by him.\n19. The knocking I heard after I had gone to bed was produced by\nDavid banging the electric light switch on the side of the bed. The switch\n\f230 Journal of Society for Psychical iResearch may-june 1946\nwas found on the floor in the morning badly chipped and it was David who\nrecognised the tune of God Save the King which to my mind is unUke the\nfinale to be chosen by a Pole.\n20. The note found in the morning by Mrs White could easily have been\nwritten by David as he said he had seen the note before it was answered\nwhen he got up to get a drink before going to sleep.\n21. After breakfast I went for a walk with David and told him the above\nmentioned points and then told him I was quite convinced he was entirely\nresponsible for all the phenomena and he replied \" Well not all of it \".\nHowever he admitted he had done everything the previous night and I am\nsure that, by the way he did it, it was not the first time he had done it.\nI told him that if he stopped his poltergeist-like phenomena I would say\nnothing to his grandmother and let people assume the entity had gone of\nits own accord. He agreed to this but I learnt a few days later that it had\nnot ceased and when 1 saw him on ist February he said he could not help it.\nI then wrote to Mrs White saying I would like to see her while the boy\nwas out, which I did on the 5th February and I told her exactly what I\nthought about the matter, and when he came in I had another talk with\nhim. Mrs White could not believe the boy was responsible until he ad-\nmitted it, but even he began to believe in Wily Willie and I feel that some\nof the things he did were performed unconsciously. I learnt that it was\nDavid who discovered the fire alight when he came home while his grand-\nmother was out, so it was quite possible for him to have lit it.\nI learnt that he did not play much with other school children as they\nlived too far away, and as he had no normal outlet for his somewhat highly-\nstrung nature, I think he subconsciously invented Wily Willie to take the\nplace of a play-mate. He was very nervous during the flying bomb raids\nand it was then that the trouble first started. No doubt he wanted some-\nthing to take his mind ofl^ the raids and the tapping on the shelter\u2014pre-\nsumably an unconscious nervous reaction\u2014gave him something to think\nabout.\nSince I told Mrs While that David was responsible nothing more has\nbeen heard and I suggested that he should be allowed to mix with other\nchildren when he returns from his holiday which he commenced a week\nlater.\nMr Fletcher, writing on the 18 April 1946, adds :\n\" David White went\naway for a holiday last February and was still away up to three weeks ago.\nHe seemed to be enjoying himself and was mixing with other children,\"\nand that, about a week after he had investigated the case the boy was taken\nto see a doctor who is a member of the S.P.R.\nTELEPATHY IN DREAMS\nMrs Miriam Lane, a member of the Society, contributes three recent cases\nof apparently telepathic dreams.\nThe first occurred towards the end of February 1946.\n\" I dosed off in a light sleep (with the wireless playing) after listening to\nthe 8 o'clock news. I was awakened by the telephone ringing at 9.15 a.m.\n\fMAY-JUNE 1946 Telepathy in Dreams 231\nI told the caller, Mary Roberti, that she had roused me from a particularly\nvivid dream. I recounted the dream to her as follows :\n\" '\nA nursemaid I did not know dismounted from her bicycle and re-\nminded me that I had forgotten to go to the rescue of a nest of young birds\nwhich were star^'ing. The parents had built on the nursery mantelpiece\nand now the windows were closed they could not feed the young. She had\nbeen sent to fetch me. Apologising for my lapse of memory I hurried to\nthe nursery and caught one of the young birds and one of the parent birds\nin a tin box. I then took the box into another smaller room to examine it,\nand establish the species of bird. On opening the box only the parent\nbird flew out, the other I assumed to be dead although I did not see the\ncorpse. Much to my disappointment I saw the bird was a common\nsparrow. I turned to my companion and said, \" Only a sparrow.\" It was\nat this point the phone rang.'\n\" Within the following five minutes my secretary, Mrs G. Fischer, rang\nme up. At the end of the con^-ersation she said, '\nYou were much in de-\nmand this morning. Last night the car injured a sparrow and Jane (her\nsix-year-old daughter) put it in the small empty room here. I thought it\nwould be all right as it ate some food, but when we went in this morning it\nwas dead. And Jane said, \" You aren't any good! I wish we had Miriam\nhere\u2014we should have fetched Miriam.\"\n'\n\" I checked up as far as possible on the time. The episode occurred\n'\njust before Jane left for school '\n\u2014thus, any time between S.45 and 9 a.m.\n\" It should be explained that I have many tame birds and rearing of\nyoung birds is always in my mind. I do not however, remember having\ndreamed of it before. The clearest points of the dream were {a) the kind\nof bird\u2014i.e. the word sparrow was heavily underlined, and the parent\nbird's plumage, noted in detail as it perched on the edge of a chest of\ndrawers, {b) the death of the young bird.\"\nMar}'' Roberti, Mrs Fischer and another friend confirm jVIrs Lane's\naccount as follows :\nMrs Lane recounted the dream to me as written above W'hen I woke her\nby telephoning at approx. 9.15 a.m. I do not remember the detail of the\nbicycle nor of the nest on the nursery mantelpiece.\n[Signed) Mary Roberti.\nMrs Lane roughly outlined the dream to me shortly after 9.15 a.m.\nbefore Mrs Fischer telephoned.\n(Signed) Grace Hinton,\n'\n194 Queen's Gate,\n\"\nLondon, S.W.\nThe account of our telephone conversation is correct.\n(Signed) Gabrielle Fischer,\n5 Cavaye Place,\nS.W. 10.\nMrs Lane adds the following note :\n\" L^nfortunately, the m.oment you write down this type of dream you\nlose some of its vividness. On re-reading the dream about the sparrow I\nthought it seemed very feeble, whereas in actual fact it was extremely\n\f232 Journal of Society for Psychical Research may-june 1946\nvivid, and it was this very character which induced me to tell it to two\nwitnesses immediately on waking, for as a rule one is inclined to spare\nfriends accounts of dreams !\n\"\nThe second and third of Mrs Lane's dreams, both confirmed by her\nhusband, are set out below. It will be noticed that the correspondence of\nthe dreams with the facts was not exact, but seems closer than one would\nexpect on the hypothesis of chance.\n\" The second dream was in the spring of 1944. On awakening I men-\ntioned to my husband that I had dreamed that a volcano had erupted in\nItaly. I said I fancied it was an island volcano. A facetious remark was\npassed to the effect that there was enough trouble in Italy without volcanoes.\nOne day later the account of the sudden and violent eruption of V'esuvius\nappeared in the press. It should here be noted that in the dream I did not\nthink it was Vesuvius but inclined to the view that the erupting crater which\nI was looking at was an '\nIsland volcano, possibly Etna '. In the dream I\ncould not remember the name '\nEtna ', but visualised its position on the\nmap.\n\" The third dream concerned rny husband who was on manoeuvres at the\ntime [November, 1943]. I dreamed a very short dream. I saw my hus-\nband standing on rocky ground and being struck on the right thigh by a\nbright green fiery object, falling from above. I did not see my husband's\nface but noted he was in battle dress. I was merely an observer in the\ndream and felt no alarm. The most striking part of the dream was the\ngreen colour of the fiery object and rocky ground. I told the dream to\ntwo people.\n\" A few days later my husband telephoned me and said he had had a\nnarrow escape when, during practice, a phosphorous bomb had fallen on\nhim and set his clothing alight. At this point I stopped him and said, '\nIt\nfell on vour right leg above the knee \" and he said, '\nYes\u2014who has been\ngossiping.? '\nI then explained about the dream. The detail about the\ncolour of the bomb was correct. When the accident occurred the ground\nhad been smooth and totally devoid of rocks.\"\nTHE JOURNAL IS PRINTED FOR PRIVATE\nCIRCULATION\n'\nThe attention of Members and Associates is drawn to the private\nnature of the Journal, from which no quotations should be madp with-\nout the previous consent of the Council.

J. West read a paper on\n\" The Telepathic Explanation of Apparitions \".\nVERIDICAL MESSAGES OBTAINED THROUGH\nAUTOMATIC WRITING\nA member of the Society, Mrs Watson (pseudonym), who several years\nago practised automatic writing, and then, after discontinuing it, resumed\nit at the beginning of March 1946, reports the following instances of\napparently veridical messages. Mrs Watson and her husband, it should be\nexplained, carry on a small-holding.\nIn 1944 I lost my wedding ring. I first noticed its loss while working\nin the cowstalls. I looked for it but could not find it. On many sub-\nsequent occasions my husband and I, and sometimes a friend, searched\nfor it without success. Cows are fond of eating bright things, and we\ncame to the conclusion that it must have slipped off my finger into the\nmanger, and that it was now reposing in some cow's inside! I did not\nbuy another ring, but wore my grandmother's wedding ring which had\nbeen given to me by an aunt.\nOn March 14th [1946] I put my mother's engagement ring on my\nfinger before starting to write. I wrote \" Can you see what I am wear-\ning to-night?\" \"Yes, my engagemeut ring, rather ugly, and my\nmother's wedding ring, my dear mother. Your wedding ring is in the\ncow-stalls you will find it next time you go down look in the sack look\nin the sack behind the door.\"\nI was unable to go out at the time, and my husband was too busy to\ngo that night ; but next day he went to the stalls and returned with the\nring\nOn March i8th a Book-test read \" This Ring the Bridegroom did for\nnone provide, But for his Bride \".\u00ab \/\nThe husband writes on the same day :\nMy wife reported the loss of her ring to me between June 25th and\nJuly 3rd, 1944. I was ill at the time, but when able to go out to the\nstalls I searched for it with considerable thoroughness, and looked for\nit on many subsequent occasions. On March 14th 1946 she showed\nme the reference to the ring in automatic writing. On March 15th I\nwent to the stalls where there were two sacks. Neither was actually\nbehind the door, but one was behind a wooden partition adjoining the\ndoor. This sack was not in the stalls when my wife lost her ring in 1944.\nDuring 1945 I had filled it with waste paper ready for salvage. Between\nthe seventh and eighth or eighth and ninth pieces of paper I found the\nring.\nIn reply to a question from the Hon. Secretary as to whether she might\nhave subconsciously remembered some occasion on which the ring\nslipped off her finger among the papers where it was ultimately found,\n\fAUG.-SEPT. 1946 Automatic Writing 237\nMrs Watson gave reasons for thinking this improbable. When she and\nher husband bought the property\n. . . there was a quantity of hme stacked in large paper bags (special\nlime bags) against the wall. This was later carted away by the rightful\nowner. Many of the bags burst when moved, and it was these torn bags\nthat my husband put into the sack for salvage. I should have passed\nfairly close to the bags of lime in mixing food for the cows, but at no\ntime did I handle the bags, and I lost the ring long before they were\ncarted away and the paper collected by my husband. . . .\nMy theory since the ring has been found is that it slipped off my\nlinger when my hands were cold and slippery . . . , rolled out of the\ndairy door into the back [i.e. a part of the cowstall where the bags were\nkept] and into' some hole or crevice in the floor where it was hidden\nfrom our view, that later rats found it and carried it into the sack where\nthere were evidences of their having started to make a nest. It is too\nfar from the dairy door to the wall where the sacks are stored for it to\nroll right over to them.\nMr Watson adds that the ring was not hidden in a fold of paper or\ntucked away in an \" envelope \" corner when he found it, but lying flat on\na flat piece of paper covered by another flat piece, and that he could hardly\nhave failed to see it when he put the paper into the sack, if it had been\nthere then. This makes it most improbable that he might have sub-\nconsciously noted the ring among the paper at that time, and later on\ntelepathically conveyed to his wife the substance of a memory latent in his\nown mind.\nMrs Wdtson has given a full account of the book tests, to one of which\nshe alludes above. It illustrates very well the difficulties and complexities\nof evidence of this type. All the tests are taken from books on her own\nshelves,, and the communicators are her father, her mother and a friend,\nD.K., who died on the 2nd March 1946.\nThe first test was given on the i8th March 1946, when Mrs Watson\nasked the three communicators \" Will you think out some book tests, or\nany definite tests that we can try together.' \" The reply was, \" Yes, of\ncourse we will. I will give you one now. You go to the third shelf of the\ncase by the stairs second book from right and turn to page \" : here came a\npause while Mrs Watson \" stiffened \", as she describes the occasional\ncheck in automatic flow, and tried to catch the number of the page ; she\nthen wrote with some hesitation, \"\n243 you go now we will wait.\"\nMrs Watson went to the case in question, which she found had four\nshelves and not five as she had supposed. As the script did not say whether\nthe shelves were to be counted from the bottom or the top she took\n{a) the second book on the right from the third shelf down, and {b) the\nsecond book on the right from the third shelf up. She adds, \" I did not\nhesitate about taking both books but had a sudden feeling that I should do\nso.\" {a) was a copy of Studies in Literature by Quiller-Couch, {b) was a\ncopy, formerly belonging to her father, of Way's verse translation of the ,\nIliad. Finding nothing appropriate on p. 243 of either book, Mrs Watson\ncarried them both to the table where she was writing and said, \" I don't\nsee anything there. What did you mean? \" In her own words, there waa\n\f238 Journal of Society for Psychical Research aug.-sept. 1946\n\" a pause and then I felt the number 123 being hammered into my brain\nwith such clearness that I did not stop to write it down, but at once turned\nto page 123 in {a) \" and having read that to the same page in {b).\nNow the first rule of a book-test is that the book and the page must be\nidentifiable without any ambiguity. If there is any doubt about either,\nthe possibility of subjective selection opens too wide a door to chance\ncoincidence. Before discussing the passages which Mrs Watson thought\nwere indicated, and appropriate to the circumstances, the double difficulty\ncreated by the ambiguity as to the book and the mistake as to the page\nmust be faced. Mrs Watson states most definitely, \" I did not hesitate\nabout taking both books \" ; from this point the test must be taken as an\nattempt to indicate an appropriate passage on the same page of each of\ntwo books. Success in it would be enormously more significant than success\nwith a single book, provided it was unequivocal success. But the page\nfirst given was wrong as regards both books, and the success described\nbelow was only reached at the second shot. Even when due allowance\nhas been made for the hesitancy as to the first choice of page, and the\nemphasis with which the second choice was \" hammered into her brain \",\nonly a special degree of appropriateness could make the test significant.\nPage 123 in Studies in Literature quoted Henry Vaughan's poem, the\nlast two lines of which read :\nThis Ring the Bride-groome did for none provide\nBut for his Bride. '\n.\nThe appropriateness of this is obvious. As to the possibility of Mrs\nWatson having, consciously or subconsciously, known where to find these\nlines, she writes :\nI have read this [i.e. Studies in Literature^ once, certainly twenty years-\nago, and have not opened it since. I did not remember it [i.e. the poem]\nwas in the book nor did I recognise it when I read it. Nor did I remem-\nber the position of the book on the shelf. My conscious visual memory\nis atrocious. ... Of course my subliminal memory may be brilliant in\ncontrast to my conscious one.\nPage 123 in Way's Iliad gives his version of the last two lines of Book\nXVI, in themselves irrelevant. Under them was a small pencilled date in\nthe handwriting of Mrs Watson's mother. On taking the book to the light,\nMrs Watson found the date to be April 14. This was D. K.'s birthday\nand one of the few dates Mrs Watson was in the habit of remembering.\nFrom comparison of other pencilled dates in the book it is clear that Mrs\nWatson's mother read the last ten books of Way's translation during April\n1929, marking the end of each day's reading with a date. Mrs Watson was\nnot then living with her mother, did not know her mother had been reading\nthe book in April 1929, and had not herself opened the book since.\nOn the 19th March 1946 Mrs Watson informed the communicators that\nthe tests of the day before were excellent, to which her father replied,\n\" We are glad about the ring. Wasn't the reference good last night?\nI chose that one bit. D. K. chose hers.\"\nOn the 2 1 St March Mrs Watson's father wrote :\n\" D. K. wants you to\ntake the little New Testament on the table and turn to p. 83. There is\na message for you. She hopes you will understand.\"\n\fAUG.-SEPT. 1946 Automatic Writing 239\nThe Nezv Testament in question was an edition in Basic English in which\nMrs Watson had till then read no more than part of St. Matthew. The\nedition is printed in two columns to a page, and the first column of p. 83\ncontains Mark XI, 2-10, i.e. the story of Palm Sunday. Mrs Watson\ncould see no point in this, and told her communicator so : he told her to\nbe patient. Later it occurred to her to find out on what day Palm Sunday\nfell in the present year : she had no idea, as the religious body to which she\nbelongs does not recognise \" special times and seasons \". She found it\nwas the 14th April. On the 23rd March 1946 she got this message from\nher mother :\n\" D. K. says she was so pleased you got the clue.\" Mrs\nWatson adds that she made a note of these three tests in a separate note-\nbook on the days they occurred, and got her husband to witness them.\nThere is a curious pattern in these three tests. Mrs Watson found in\neach a message appropriate to her thoughts and feelings at the time.\nThe first two are linked together by the fact that both were to be found\non the same page of two books chosen at the same time. The second and\nthird both point to the same date, a date having a special association for\nMrs Watson. Notwithstanding the element of confusion as regards both\nbook and page affecting the first two tests, it seems unlikely that such a\npattern should come about fortuitously.\nA RECOGNISED APPARITION SEEN BY\nTWO PERCIPIENTS\nDr Douglas Swinscow, a member of the S.P.R., contributes the following\naccount of the apparition of a young man, about nine months after his\ndeath in action, to two ladies for whose veracity Dr Swinscow is prepared\nto vouch. The real names have been communicated to the Society, but\npseudonyms are used throughout.\nThe young man, David Western, joined the R.N.V.R. in 1940 and was\ndrowned when his ship was sunk in December 1941. In 1940 he and his\nwife shared house with Mrs Carter, one of the percipients, and her hus-\nband, and it was in this house that Mrs Carter saw the apparition. The\nother percipient. Miss Janet Mack, had never known David Western, or\nseen a photograph of him : she knew that he had joined the R.N.V.R.\nand been killed.\nThe apparition was seen on the 15th September 1942 when' Mrs Carter\nmade this entry in her diary :\nA most curious experience for both Janet and me as we both inde-\npendently saw D. W.\u2014she in the garden and me in the house\u2014very bogy\nand odd!!\nOn the 28th September 1942 she gave a fuller account in a letter to a\nfriend, as follows :\nI tell you the following story for what it is worth : all I can assure you\nis that it is not a fairy tale and that as you know neither Janet tior I are\ngiven to strange imaginings!\nAbout a couple of weeks ago . . . whilst I was busy with tea etc.\nJanet went and toiled in the garden. She came in at supper time and\nafterwards we helped Dick with homework until 8.45 and then set\ntracks for bed. ... I went off down to the bathroom to do my teeth :\n\f240 Journal of Society for Psychical Research aug.-sept. 1946\nwe then settled ourselves and listened to the news and embarked upon a\ndesultory conversation about this and that including D. W.\nSuddenly Janet said rather timidly, \" You may think me very silly,\nbut I could swear I saw D. W. in the garden this evening,\" whereupon\nI nearly dropped because I too had seen him on my way to the bath-\nroom.\nHer story was that she was busily weeding and not thinking of anyone\nin particular when something made her look round, and there she saw a\nman approaching : her first instinct was that (a), it was Ben [the husband\nof a member of the household] {b), owing to the naval uniform it was a\ncaller, and she was about to be social and think of finding me when it\nslowly faded out ; it was perfectly distinct, she said, but surrounded by a\ngrey mist : she forced herself to collect her gardening things and then\nswiftly made tracks for the house and some more solid human contacts!\nMy story was that as I ran down the first few stairs something made\nme look over the bannisters and at first I thought it was Beatrice [her\nsister] coming upstairs, the same grey mist which I thought was her grey\nhair. I didn't see the uniform but I saw his face quite distinctly (one\ncouldn't see clothes very distinctly anyway looking over the bannisters).\nReeling slightly I fled into the bathroom and completed my ablutions\nby which time the atmosphere was clear again!\nNeither of us had any actual fright at the time, only retrospectively,\nand I must admit that when we had both had the same experiences\nwithin a couple of hours we did feel a trifle shaken!\nOn the 2nd May 1946 Miss Jawe\/ Mack gave to Dr Swinscow the follow-\ning quite independent account\n:\nIn the summer of 1942 I was staying at the house of a friend of mine,\nMrs Carter. One evening at twilight in late August or September,\nwhen I was working alone 'in the garden, I suddenly felt the urge to\nturn round, as though someone were looking at me ; and on doing so I\nsaw a man walking up the garden path about 20 yards away. I saw him\nperfectly clearly : he was dressed in naval uniform, appeared to have\nthe same reality as his surroundings and though I did not recognise his\nfeatures I retained a clear recollection of them. I then noticed that\nthere was something peculiar about him ; he seemed to be surrounded\nby a misty radiance, and his outline was slightly blurred. As I became\naware of this a doubt came into my mind, and as it did so the figure\nseemed to disintegrate and to become merged into the path. I could not\nsay exactly what the doubt was about but a feeling of chill foreboding\nthen pervaded me ; I gathered up my gardening tools, and fled into the\nhouse, feeling the need for human company.\nI then had dinner with Mrs Carter, but did not discuss the matter with\nher because I wanted to get used to the experience, to assimilate it first.\nAbout 2\\ hours after I had seen the figure, that is, about 9.15 p.m.,\nI told Mrs Carter all about my experience, and as I did so I noticed that\nher face became fearful and white, and she seemed much moved by\nsomething.\nMiss Mack then gives her recollection of how Mrs Carter described her\nown experience : substantially it corresponds to the two accounts given by\nMrs Carter in her letter of 28th September 1942, and below. Miss Mack,\n\fAUG.-SEPT. 1946 A Recognised Apparition 241\nin reply to an enquiry by Dr Swinscow, amplifies her account of the way\nshe told Mrs Carter of her experience, thus :\nWhen I described the ghost to Mrs Carter I remember saying \" Do\nyou think it could have been D. I saw to-night when I was gardening :\nhis face was rather glum-looking, he was fairly thick-set, and he had\nlarge eyes.\nOn receiving Miss Mack's account of the 2nd May 1946, Dr Swinscow,\nwho had not then seen Mrs Carter's letter of 28th September 1942, wrote to\nMrs Carter asking for her version of the incident. After recording her\nconversation with Miss Mack soon after 9 p.m. on 15th September 1942,\nMrs Carter proceeds :\nI then told her that just before 9 p.m., when on my way to the bath-\nroom, something had made me look over the bannisters on to the lower\npart of the stairs. I saw what I at first took to be my sister's grey hair\ncoming upstairs, but then I saw that it was D. W.'s head and shoulders\nsurrounded by a thick grey haze which obscured his body entirely. I\nwent straight to the bathroom, turned on the light, and looked back,\nbut by that time the face had gone, though the haze remained. After\nfinishing my ablutions I looked again, and found that the haze too had\ndisappeared.\nWe lived in the house until the summer of 1945, but as far as I know\nno one ever saw anything of this kind again.\nIt is generally recognised (see Proc, X, 98, 304) that particular care is\nneeded in examining the records of visual experiences occurring out of\ndoors to make sure that the experience really was hallucinatory. Miss\nMack writing more than three years after the experience, describes it as\ntaking place \" at twilight \" in late August or September, and later in the\nsame account fixes the hour as 7 p.m., i.e. 2j hours before 9.15. Mrs\nCarter in her letter of 28th September 1942 merely places it as happening\nbefore supper. But at 7 p.m. on the 15th September 1942 at the place in\nquestion the sun would have been still above the horizon, and visibility\nshould have been good. The figure was seen at 20 yards' distance ; the\nuniform and the features were clearly seen : and finally \" the figure\nseemed to disintegrate and melt into the path \". It is very hard to suppose\nthat in these circumstances Miss Mack, whom Dr Swinscow describes as\n\" an active, practical business woman, not interested in paranormal pheno-\nmena \", should have mistaken a man of flesh and blood for a phantasm.\nThe Ben of Mrs Carter's narrative did not wear naval uniform and was not\nin fact within ten miles of the place.\nMrs Carter's experience occurred indoors at between 8.45 and 9 p.m.\nShe does not in either of her accounts describe the lighting on the stair-\ncase when she first saw the face which she took for the moment to be her\nsister's, who, as it happened, was not in the house at the time. But she\nsaw the features clearly, and after she had turned the bathroom light on,\nsaw the haze into which the face seems to have resolved itself.\nIt would appear then that on the same evening within about two hours\nboth percipients had hallucinatory visual experiences. Were they two\napparitions, or one apparition seen twice and in two places.? The second\npercipient recognised her apparition as that of a man she had known well,\nand after hearing the description given by the first percipient, who had\n\f242 . Journal of Society for Psychical Research aug.-sept. 1946\nnot known him, seems to have had no doubt that the person seen by both\nwas the same.\nREVIEWS\nWhat is Life? By Erwin Schrodinger. Pp. viii + 91. Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 1945. 6s.\nThe main theme of Professor Schrodinger's book is the inabihty of the\nlaws of chemistry and physics, as at present formulated, to account for the\nphenomena of life. All those relevant to the functioning of living organisms\nare based on the improbability of large fluctuations from statistical\naverages. The small particles\u2014electrons, atoms, molecules\u2014making up\nanimate and inanimate matter behave individually in an unpredictable\nway, but the smallest visible particle contains so many of them that orderly\nlaws result from the mutual cancellation of individual idiosyncrasies of\nbehaviour. Physical science at present deals only with the order based on\ndisorder. Further, one of the most important laws of physics is that\ndisorder always increases until it is' as great as possible. Any portion of the\nuniverse when isolated from the rest soon reaches a state in which nothing\nappears to be happening\u2014unless it contains a living organism. Living\norganisms keep active for long periods in apparent disobedience to this\nlaw. The disobedience is only apparent ; the organism absorbs well-\nordered (in the physical sense) portions of its surroundings as food, and\ndiscards them in a poorly-ordered state. It thus counteracts the increase\nin disorder in itself, which otherwise would soon reduce it to inactivity, by\nextracting order from its environment. But there is a more fundamental\nway in which physical laws fail to account for the behaviour of life. The\ngeneral form of a species remains unaltered for many generations, and\neach member of the species develops from a small speck of matter, the\nfertilized egg. Somehow the egg must contain within it the whole pattern\nof the organism, the mechanism for realising it, and for ensuring its repro-\nduction in future generations. It seems certain from the biological\nevidence that this pattern is contained within a small part of the egg, called\nthe chromatin network, which produces an exact copy of itself in every\ncell division. This network contains far too few atoms to function as an\nordinary physical mechanism, producing orderly results by the mutual\ncancellation of random disorders. Somehow it must produce order from\norder, must produce an exact copy of itself by, so to speak, the force of its\nexample. The closest analogy with a process familiar in non-living\nmatter is crystallization, but the most a crystal can do is increase in size\nby the orderly arrangement of atoms or molecules deposited on its surface.\nThe production of a complex, active order by replication is not included\nwithin the present scheme of physical science. Professor Schrodinger\nhas however no doubt that science will progress to include it.\nThe description of the functions of life and particularly of the mechan-\nism of inheritance and of the change in the character of a species by\nnaturally or artificially produced mutations forms the greater part of the\nbook. It is not without bearing on psychical research, or at any rate on\npoltergeists. It has been suggested that these acquire the energy required\nfor their disturbances by removing heat from the environment, an explana-\n\fAUG.-SEPT. 1946 Reviews 243\ntion that would at the same time account for the cold shudder or cold spots\nsometimes accompanying such phenomena. The poltergeist would thus\nbring about an increase of order, but would contravene a well-established\nphysical law which applies, as Professor Schrodinger shows, to living\norganisms. These function in a way not foreseen in the development of\nphysical science, but do not disobey its established laws. This suggestion\nconcerning the paranormal functioning of poltergeists is therefore without\nanalogy in the normal functioning of life.\nMore important however is the short epilogue on determinism and free\nwill. The events in the body of a living being that correspond to the\nactivity of its mind, to its self-conscious actions, are at least statistically\ndeterminate. In Professor Schrodinger's view quantum indeterminacy\nplays no biologically important role. On the other hand each of us has an\nimmediate experience of free will ; we direct our actions, foresee the results,\ntake (and are expected by others to take) responsibility for them. Most\npeople who have thought on this problem consider either the determinacy\nor the free will an illusion, but Professor Schrodinger argues that both are\ninescapable facts, and draws the conclusion that he\u2014and every conscious\nmind\u2014is the Being that controls the universe through the laws of nature.\nThere is thus a single consciousness for the universe, and we are windows\nthrough which it manifests. The concept of individual souls is a hasty\ninference from the plurality of similar bodies, and the concordant experi-\nence of western as well as eastern mystics, Dens factiis sum, is ultimate\ntruth.\nGiven the premises, the conclusion is logically inescapable, but Nature\nhas a way of transcending human logic, and there is much of the irrational\nin modern physics, some of it introduced by Professor Schrodinger himself.\nOne may therefore be permitted to suspend judgement on the biological\ndemonstration of the existence of God and His plurality in unity of mani-\nfestation in man, but it is interesting that Mr Carington has arrived at\nsomewhat the same conclusion through his telepathic experiments : so\nfar as these phenomena are concerned, things happen not as if many minds\nwere involved, but only one. Convergence of independent approaches\nconfirms belief in a conclusion, and if Mr Carington points to Andrew\nLang's Brahma :\nI am the batsman and the bat,\nI am the bowler and the ball,\nThe umpire, the pavilion cat.\nThe roller, pitch, and stumps, and ALL,\nProfessor Schrodinger reaches Emerson's :\nIf the red slayer think he slays,\n'\nOr if the slain think he is slain,\nThey know not well the subtle ways\nI keep and pass and turn again. ...\nThey reckon ill who leave me out ;\n;\nWhen me they fly, I am the wings ;\nI am the doubter and the doubt,\nAnd I the hymn the Brahmin sings.\n. , A. J. C. Wilson\n\f244 Journal of Society for Psychical Research aug.-sept. 1946\nBeyond the Five Senses. By Margery Bazett. Pp. 96. Basil Blackwell,\nOxford. 7s. 6d.\nMiss Bazett recounts many personal experiences due to the voluntary,\nor to the spontaneous, exercise of her natural psychic endowment. Being\nversed in the literature of the S.P.R. and familiar with its problems she is\nable to view them from both sides, that of the student and that of the\nmedium. Hence she is able to tell us what it feels like when information\nreaches her by supernormal means (pp. 16-17 !\n21-22 ; 55). Her ex-\nperiences include psychometry, clairvoyance, forecasts of the future, the\nsuccessful tracing of missing people ; besides the reception of messages\nfor the bereaved, both when the latter were present and also when the\nonly link with them had been a letter of appeal for help.\nMiss Bazett 's attitude to her psychic gift is seen in the following (p. 5) :\n\" These things should urge us to ask ourselves of what nature is this\nimpact upon our world from the supernormal source.? Has it any meaning\nfor us? Can it serve any useful purpose.? Does it enlarge our knowledge?\nThat is how I regard the matter, and it is in that way that I am trying\n^ to examine it \".\nThe incidents recorded by Miss Bazett may prompt inquirers to\nexamine afresh some of the problems of psychic research. Let us take -\nan instance of what is popularly termed \" Psychometry \". About this\nwe are almost as much in the dark as when in 1840 Buchanan, a professor\nof physiology in four medical colleges, first wrote of it, and Denton, a\nprofessor of geology, published in 1854 his three volumes entitled The\nSoul of Things, or when much later Dr Pagenstecher concluded, after\nlong experiment, that Psychometric sensations are initiated with the skin,\nthe original sensitive organ of biological history, the special senses being\nlater differentiated from it : these primitive sensations being usually\nignored because we have better organs of sensation which are only placed\nin abeyance during states of trance or dissociation.\nOn pp. 53-54 Miss Bazett describes an interesting psychometric\nexperiment. Three small bags of sand were sent her from a site in the\nEast where excavation was in progress. These bags were alike in size\nand numbered One, Two, Three. Impressions from Two and Three\ncorresponded with the facts relating to ancient customs of pre-civilised\ntimes, while Number One seemed definitely connected with a person.\n\" This surprised me, as I believed it to contain sand only, the feeling to\none's fingers through the canvas being exactly the same \". It actually\ncontained a fragment of skull from a Christian burial of the sixth or seventh\ncentury. Notes taken down by a friend while this bag was being psy-\nchometrised run thus :\nThis is entirely different from the others . . . the others are out of\ndoor scenes, as it were . . . this is something of an entirely different\ncharacter. I might be psychometrising a personal letter, or article. . . .\nIt is like the feeling of a person ... I rather wonder whether this person\nor persons would wear some very large jewel, or cross-like object, on\nthe breast . . . one piece across the other, not necessarily a cross ... its\nlength greater than its width ... I should rather wonder if it had been .\nlying inside something for a long, long time . . . holding it, I almost feel\nas if I were buried . . . lying in an extremely quiet spot, rather a wonder-\n\fAUG.-SEPT. 1946 Reviews 245\nful spot ... I feel an atmosphere as if sleeping in great peace, resting\nin a wonderful spot ... a feeling of being underground, that kind of\nthing ... as if I were myself under the ground, or shut in somewhere\n... I should suggest that there might be considerable interest about\nthe person or persons ... an outstanding figure or figures ... it seemed\nto be on the left-hand side, as if the head were in a corner. If it is\nconnected with one person, it is a man.\nSince this can be paralleled by many other psychometrical experiments\nwe may rule out chance coincidence and proceed to ask how is the\nINFORMATION OBTAINED.-^ There would seem to be at least four possible\nhypotheses ; two of them relating to the medium's unaided ability, and\ntwo requiring co-operation with the mind or memory of another person.\nLet us examine the probabihty of each.\n1. The medium's interpretation of impressions in, or upon, the psy-\nchometrised object.\nIn this the medium's attention would be concentrated on the primitive\nsense of Feeling (from which our five senses are specialised) and obtain\nby this means certain Indications. These indications are then somehow\ninterpreted as facts relating to the object, or to its owner.\n2. The medium interprets impressions in the Common Unconscious,\nor World Mind, or Akashic Records.\nBut how could a medium find the particular required facts amid the\ninnumerable stores of such supposed Mind or Records? When we wish\nto recollect something we usually flash attention along our store of mem-\nories and look with the mind's eye for something relevant to the thing\nrequired. But in psychometry the medium does not know what the\ntarget may be, or what is, or is not, relevant!\n3. The object links the medium with the owner.\nThis assumes that, while slightly dissociated, the medium's etherial\nbody can link with the etheric part of the article to be psychometrised.\nThis linking, let us suppose, gives the individual vibration, or key-note,\nwhich brings touch with the owner of the object, who may be on earth\nor elsewhere. The information required is then received from that\nperson, whether yielded voluntarily or otherwise.\n4. The object links the medium with a Control, or a Communicator,\nwho gives the required impressions.\nMrs Osborne Leonard's Control can undoubtedly perceive the personal\ncharacter of sitters and also of Communicators. She will sometimes\nremark that a would-be Communicator is not sufficiently within range for\nmessages and that she will meanwhile \" get something from him \". Then\nfollow remarks about his character and mentality. With the poorer class\nof mediums one may get nothing but this psychometrising of the sitter,\nwhich yields merely general remarks about one's character and interests.\nIn better sittings this psychometrising preludes messages from genuine\nCommunicators. Of this relationship between psychometry and com-\nmunication Miss Bazett provides illustrations (pp. 26 to 29).\nIn Dr Hettinger's remarkably interesting book, The Ultra-perceptive\nFaculty, he records numerous experiments in the psychometrising by a\nsensitive of an article in the absence of its owner. He considers that a\nmental rapport is established between the sensitive and the object's owner,\n\f246 Journal of Society for Psychical Research aug.-sept. 1946\nand that whatever is then perceived by the sensitive would seem to be\npresent in, or accessible to, the psychological make-up of that owner at\nthe time of the experiment. He found that this ability, displayed in the\nabsence of the person to whom the psychometrised article belonged,\ndiffered with different persons. With objects belonging to some persons\nthe success was high, while with others it was slight, or altogether negli-\ngible. This is not surprising when one recalls the well-known fact that\nsom.e people are bad sitters while others rarely have failures. It would\nseem that a certain kind of harmony between the type of medium and the\ntype of sitter is essential to success.\nA complete solution of the Psychometry problem would probably\nprovide the key to many others. So far we know but little. Onfe feels\nthat a determined attack by many groups under some central oversight\nmight succeed in wresting this secret from Nature. It was by such an\nattack that the Atomic Bomb was produced. When will a like sense of\nurgency prompt Psychical Research to emulate the triumph of Physics?\nClairvoyance. On p. 7 we find Miss Bazett's account of \" seeing \" her\nbrother and his wife walking in, what she sensed to be, London, whereas\nthey resided in the West of England and she had no knowledge of their\nmovements. Watching them she noted that they entered a house and\nthat conversation followed about a proposed operation in that house,\nwhich was a nursing home. Inquiries later proved that the actual happen-\nings on the day were as she had clairvoyantly observed.\nWhat is one to think of such incidents? The overworked word \" tele-\npathy \" does not help us, especially as the researches of Dr Rhine tend\nto include it in Clairvoyance (c\/p S.P.R. Proceedings for June 1946,\npp. 1-7).\nOne asks. Did Miss Bazett go to the place seen, or did the scene come\nto her? For herself, she can give no decided answer. About clairvoyant\nexperiences she remarks that such visions are brief and cannot be repeated\nat will ; that she can sometimes see surrounding objects through the\nvision, although the vision is so clear that it is difficult to distinguish it\nfrom seeing with the eyes.\nQuite possibly the result is achieved by different methods, as the\nthings seen are near at hand, or far away.\nWhen near at hand the vision may result from a functioning of etherial\nsight\u2014(seeing with the etherial body)\u2014which, for all we know, may be\ncapable of considerable extension and unaffected by intervening walls.\nOr, from a partial and temporary sharing of the awareness which is\ngoing on in the mind of the actor or actors in the visualised scene.\nOr, from some kind of picture-projection analogous, in the mental\nsphere, to a desert mirage of distant sea and ships.\nAs for the far-away visions, one falls back on the usual conception of\nstrongly emotional thought by the agent being directed to the percipient\nwho subconsciously translates the incoming impression into sight or\nsym.bol.\nIt is here that Dr Hettinger's second book. Exploring the Ultra-perceptive\nFaculty, may help us. He concludes that, in clairvoyance at a distance,\nthe source of the sensitive's impressions is the psychological make-up\nof the person concerned in the description : that person being, in his\n\fAUG.-SEPT. 1946 Reviews 247\nseries of experiments, the owner of some article which had been placed\nnear the sensitive. One may suggest that some chance thought of the\npercipient, or a strong emotional bond between two persons, might serve\nas connecting link in cases of spontaneous clairvoyance. If so, these\nspontaneous cases of distant clairvoyance would come within the orbit\nof what we have hitherto termed Telepathy,\u2014the action of thought\nbetween two persons. But what exactly is this Thinking? and how does\nit produce results at distance from the thinker.? Although no answer to\nthese questions is yet forthcoming, it may be that the P.K. (Psycho-\nKinetic) experiments will lead us one step forward. In the A.S.P.R.\nJournal for July 1946 there is an article by Mrs L. A. Dale, who claims\nthat success has followed recent attempts to influence inanimate objects,\nnamely dice, by thought alone. She says :\n\" The hypothesis of '\nMind\nover Matter '\nis the only one adequate to account for the results obtained.\"\nThis is the latest report from the band of workers inspired by Dr. Rhine\nand his group in Dale University. In the above-mentioned article there is\none specially suggestive speculation, for it suggests that it is the Experi-\nmenter who plays the dominating part in obtaining P.K. results. \" It is\nour tentative hypothesis that the experimenter influences the dice, and that\nthe Subject plays his role in either liberating or inhibiting this ability\nof the experimenter.\" Doubtless this will be tested out experimentally.\nIt accords with the fact that some persons, who are unable to obtain\nresults alone, say in producing table movements or automatic writing,\ncan often succeed when joined by another person.\nMrs Dale notes that, in her series of experiments with dice, there\nappeared the \" decline effect \" so often manifested in E.S.P. research.\nThose who obtained a good record of hits made most of them at the start,\nand at subsequent re-starts. Hits decreased with the duration of the run.\nThis \" decline effect \" is conspicuous in the accumulating P.K. data.\nIt is significant that a similar decline in successes has been obtained in\nthose series of trance sittings where Book Tests, Newspaper Tests and\nProxy Cases have been long continued. The progressive decrease in\nsuccess is exactly as if someone wearied of the monotonous repetition of\nsimilar effort. A possible cause may be the involuntary slackening of\nattention as the first flush of interest fades. Attention is important ; for\nthe psychic \" feel \" is very faint with most people, and only by attention\ncan its indications reach the conscious mind.\nIf the praiseworthy perseverance in P.K. experiment should be crowned\nwith such success as will establish the fact beyond all question, we shall\nbe able to assume that the intensive thinking of an object, or of a person,\nmay produce an effect : the movement of objects may be guided and\npersons \" impressed \" with ideas, impulses or desires. Thus some light\nwould be thrown on both the physical and the mental phenomena of\nPsychical Research.\nIt is all delightfully puzzling. We may hope much from the efforts\nof P.K. investigators on both sides the Atlantic. If and when the thing\nis proved, its implications will be worthy the deepest ponderings of psycho-\nlogist and philosopher, while we shall be better able to understand the\nmodus operandi of such experiences as Miss Bazett records.\nC.

West\nStatistical experiments in E.S.P., as they are commonly carried out,\nrequire percipients who will record thousands upon thousands of card\n\fOCT.-NOV. 1946 The Possibilities of a Broadcast 251\nguesses. A great deal of time is taken up by the process, and it is exces-\nsively monotonous work to experimenters and percipients alike. More-\nover, there is some suggestion that percipients' scores decline as the\nnovelty of the experiment wears off.\nA mass experiment, employing thousands of percipients at a time, would\nhave many advantages. A large bulk of material would be made available\nfor analysis without each percipient having to attend a series of boring\nexperimental sessions. The mass experiment might be used to answer the\nvexed question of what proportion of the general population possess E^S.P.\npowers that are demonstrable in statistical experiments.\nThe obvious means of securing a large number of percipients is the radio.\nSo far as I know there have been two broadcast experiments in this country.\nThe first was carried through by Dr Woolley in 1927, and the second, in\nwhich Dr Soal participated, took place in 1945.\nNeither experiment was considered satisfactory on account of the diffi-\nculty of applying ordinary statistical methods to the results. It is im-\npossible to have a long series of guesses in the space of time allowed for a\nbroadcast, and in a short series of card symbols the problem of preferences\narises. Some symbols are more likely to be guessed than others, quite\nindependently of any telepathic influence. The 1927 experiment, in\nwhich playing cards were used, showed that aces were great favourites,\nwhereas eights tended to be avoided. The ace of spades was chosen\n14! times more frequently than the eight of spades.\nIt is possible to allow for these preferences if their extent can be de-\ntermined empirically in a separate experiment, but it makes the statistics\nmore complicated, and does not get over all the difficulties. Where cards\nor fixed symbols are used, such as the rose and skull of the 1945 experi-\nment, preferences affect not only the individual guesses, but also the actual\nsequence. For instance, if numbers were being used, the sequence i, 2, 3,\n4, 5, might prove to be a great favourite. It is very difficult indeed to allow\nfor sequence preferences in evaluating the results.\nFor this reason, I suggest that cards are unsuitable for a broadcast\nexperiment. It would be preferable to ask percipients to describe ran-\ndomly chosen objects of a qualitative nature which would be unlikely to\ngive rise to sequence preferences. Supposing there were two such objects\nA and B. It would be a simple matter to determine whether the occurrence\nof A and B as targets affected the frequency of A and B in the percipients'\nreplies.

On the other hand\nthe results cannot be said to approach a proof.\" In my opinion this state-\nment was too conservative, owing to the fact that no statistical assessment\nwas attempted. I should say that the results gave indications of the opera-\ntion of a paranormal faculty. The importance of the result can hardly be\nover-estimated. A large-scale experiment of this type, with percipients\nscattered all over the country, and with agents under strict supervision,\novercomes many of the objections that can be raised against experiments\nmore directly dependent upon the accuracy and good faith of individual\nexperimenters. Unfortunately the judge who scored the responses in this\nexperiment knew the targets and may have been influenced in his scoring\nby what he knew to be the right answer. *\nIn order to make this type of result fool proof, the assessment would have\nto be made by an independent judge who would be given the percipients'\nguesses without being told which target objects they were trying to describe.\nAn experiment such as I have outlined could be conveniently included\nat the close of a short talk.

S. G. SoAL\nK. M. GOLDNEY\nSir,\u2014I would like to draw attention to a feature in the experience of Miss\nJanet Mack recorded on page 241 of the Journal which is of considerable\ninterest in the discussions regarding the objectivity of apparitions and\nghosts. Miss Mack writes as follows :\n\" When I was working alone in the garden, I suddenlyfelt the urge to turn\nround as though someone were looking at me ; and on doing so I saw a man\nwalking up the garden path about 20 yards away \" (italics are mine).\nThis impulse to turn round to see the apparition is not an uncommon\nfeature of these accounts but this is a very clear case. It has a distinct\nbearing on Myers' theory, \" that a 'psychical invasion '\ndoes take place ;\nthat a '\nphantasmogenetic centre '\nis actually established in the percipient's\nsurroundings ; that some movement bearing some relation to space as we\nknow it is actually accomplished ; and some presence is transferred and\nmay or may not be discerned by the invaded person ...\" {Human Person-\nality). Again he says later on \" I hold that when the phantom is discerned\nby more than one person at once (and on some other but not all other\noccasions) it is actually effecting a change in that portion of space where it\nis perceived, though not as a rule in the matter which occupies that place. \".\nMyers himself does not seem to have seen the bearing of such cases as\nMiss Mack's on his theory, but Bozzano in his monograph \" Les Phen-\nomenes de Hantise \" in discussing Myers' theory remarks that he must\nnote in its favour several things which have escaped Myers \" and first of all\ncalls attention to this not uncommon \" more or less irresistable impulse to\nturn round and look in the direction of the place in which it (the ghost) is,\nbut this should not happen in the case of subjective ghosts caused by\ntelepathy which ought to show themselves to the percipient no matter\nwhere he is looking and not only in one particular direction. . . . Add to\nthis that the fact of the sudden and motiveless impulse to look round implies\nan action of this kind on the part of the agent for which there would be no\nreason unless there was at that place \" a modification of space \" under-\nstood in the sense that some real thing is located there, a thing which could\nnot be seen anywhere else just as well.\"\nBozzano does not argue from this that all ghosts are objective. Far from\nit : he agrees with Myers that most ghosts and apparitions are merely\nsubjective but he adduces this and one or two other arguments overlooked\nby Myers to show that in some cases in some sense or other there is a real\npresence of the agent in a particular spot in space.\nAs this aspect of the matter appears to have been overlooked in recent\ndiscussions of apparitions and ghosts, it seems worth while to draw atten-\ntion to it.\nYours faithfully,\n: . , B. Abdy Collins\n\f254 Journal of Society for Psychical Research oct.-nov. 1946\nA CASE OF PREVISION\nIn August 1946 the Research Officer received from Mr Kenneth W.\nHodgson, of 71 Score Lane, Liverpool, who had read the S.P.R. Pamphlet,\nin which readers are invited to send to the Society records of their\npsychic experiences, the following \" Statement of Personal Experience of\nPrevision\".\nOn a number of occasions during June 1940 during dreams and twice\nwhilst awake the date August loth was in my \" mind's eye \". The\nimage was visual and appeared as\nAUG 10\nobviously a calendar form, though I could not associate it with any\ncalendar in my recollection. The letters and figures appeared to be\ncomposed of light, in relief against a very pale grey, almost neutral\nbackground.\nThe two waking experiences occurred whilst sitting quietly smoking,\nwaiting for the siren to go. On both occasions there was a feeling of\nimpending trouble.\nI was at the time in very good health, but rather fatigued, because I\nwas day school teaching, serving in the L.D.V. and in the A.R.P. as a\nwarden.\nI communicated this experience to my fiancee in a letter dated 25.6.40\n. in these words :\n\u2022\n\" Often in my dreams I see in symbols of light the date August loth.\nI do not know its significance ...\"\nAfter I had written that letter the experience was not repeated.\nI assumed that I was being warned that I should be seriously injured\nor killed on that date. Later it occurred to me that the warning might\nrefer to my fiancee.\nWhen the siren sounded on the evening of August loth I felt that I\nwas going to meet whatever was in store\n!\nThe raid however proved to be very light and nothing occurred where\nI was living, and, though, for reasons not relevant, I could not com-\nmunicate immediately with my fiancee, I ascertained that no incidents\nhad occurred anywhere near her.\nReviewing the matter on the following day I was amused to think of\nthe importance I had attached to a seemingly groundless hallucination.\nA fortnight later, however, I received word that my fiancee was\nseriously ill with tetanus and not expected to live. It transpired that she\nhad cut her leg rather badly on an air raid shelter on August loth.\nMr Hodgson explains that the wound did not receive proper attention at\nthe time, that the illness which followed was not at first recognised as\ntetanus but that a fortnight later the doctor in ordering her removal to\nhospital expressed the view that there was no hope of her recovering. After\nnine months of great suflFering she made a complete recovery. Mr\nHodgson's statement proceeds :\nShe told me subsequently that when she saw the deep gash in her\nleg, she thought \" August loth after all \" but the thought did not\nrecur.\nI have had other experiences, possibly of an extra-normal nature but\n\fOCT.-NOV. 1946 A Case of Prevision 255\nthis is the only occasion when I have communicated the information to\nanother in anticipation.\nThe lady concerned later became my wife. I am therefore asking her\nto attach her signature to this statement to support my evidence.\nzyd August 1946 PCenneth W. Hodgson\n\u2022\n.\n. M.A. (Cantab)\nDora Hodgson\nIn reply to questions by the Research Officer Mr Hodgson sent for his\ninspection the page of his letter of the 25th June from which a passage has\nbeen quoted. In the letter Mr Hodgson speaks of the possibility of his\nbeing called up for active service before the loth August 1940 and suggests\nthat the interpretation of his experience may be his own death in action.\nQuestioned as to whether he had told anyone before the loth August that\nhe thought the date had probably something to do with his fiancee, then\nMiss Dora Craven, rather than himself, Mr Hodgson replied :\n... I naturally refrained from making the suggestion that Dora Craven\nmight be affected when I wrote the letter of 25.6.40. But in conversa-\ntions when we met between that date and the beginning of August that\npossible interpretation was casually discussed, in terms of Mr Dunne's\nhypothesis.\nI regret that no further corroboration appears possible ; I can re-\ncollect discussing this dream with only one man and he was, I know,\nkilled in '43. And as we met several times after 25th June, there was no\noccasion for Dora to reply, so that the possibility, though present in her\nmind, was not committed to paper.\nMr Hodgson also informed the Research Officer that he dreams infre-\nquently, perhaps three or four times a year ; that he has had three\n\" audile \" dreams, recurrent over a long period but apparently meaning-\nless : that in another recurrent dream, which also occurred as a waking\nexperience, \" movement appeared to be depressed and hindered by im-\npulses for which I could not account \" ; this latter experience \" consisted\nentirely of such symptoms associated with a particular street, and whicli\nwere in that street so marked that I found it difficult to force myself to walk\nalong it, till the street was badly hit and I had a singularly fortunate\nescape \" ; that the experience relating to the loth August was the only one\nhe has had that was at the same time \" psychic \", recurrent and visual ;\nthat \" there was no association of the date with disaster during dreams.\n... In waking, however, the appearance of the date was associated with the\nusual symptoms of anticipatory fear \".\nMany English people in June 1940 had, with good reason, anxious fore-\nbodings as to events in August that might be serious for their country, and\ntherefore for themselves. In many cases these probably expressed them-\nselves in dreams, and sometimes perhaps in visual impressions received\nwhile they were awake. I do not remember that any special fears attached\nthemselves to the loth of the month, the day specified in Mr Hodgson's\nexperience.\nIt is clear from his letter of the 25th June 1940 that he thought of the\nmischance foreshadowed for that day as a personal, rather than a public\none, and in the event so it was, but not directly personal to himself. The\npossibility of fortuitous fulfilment is of course increased if events affecting\n\f256 Journal of Society for Psychical Research OCT.-NOV. 1946\nthe percipient indirectly are brought into account. Is there anything in\nthe experience itself pointing to Miss Craven ? Nothing in the content of\nthe visions, but some significance ought perhaps to be attached to the non-\nrecurrence of the experience after Mr Hodgson had written to her in-\nforming her of it.\nAN APPEAL TO MEMBERS\nThe scarcity of good material for investigation is the one great difficulty\nwhich stands in the way of the Society's post-war research programme.\nSuccessful subjects for telepathic experiments are scarce. Physical\nmediums have always been rare, but now it is almost as difficult to obtain\na good mental medium to give sittings for investigation purposes. Reports\nof cases are coming in, but not as rapidly as might be wished.\nThere are a number of ways in which members might help to rectify the\nsituation. Members could, by performing simple experiments in their own\nhomes with cards and drawings, test far more people for telepathy than\ncould a single research officer working at the S.P.R. rooms. It is very\nimportant that the results of all such tests, whether good or bad, should be\nnoted and reported. If some Successful percipients were discovered, they\ncould then be employed in larger scale experiments, which would be de-\nsigned to throw light on the nature of the faculty, and would be carried out\nunder conditions satisfactory to the critics.\nIt would also help on the Society's work if members would send in\nconfidential reports of their experiences with mediums, and advise the\nSociety as to the best mediums to approach. Some mediums have pro-\nbably been discouraged from giving sittings to the Society's representatives\nby tendencious reports that they would not receive considerate treatment.\nBy explaining that the S.P.R.'s investigators are fair-minded and sym-\npathetic, members could do much to remove this mistrust.\nNow that plans for the future are being discussed, the Society's officers\nwould be glad to hear from any members who have ideas as to promising\nlines of research.\nD. J. W.\nDR GARDNER MURPHY ON SURVIVAL\nDr Gardner Murphy's articles in the January, April and October, 1945,\nissues of the Journal (vol. XXXIX) of the American S.P.R. deserve the\nclose attention of all who are interested in the problem of survival.\nIn the January number Dr Murphy gives \" An Outline of Survival\nEvidence \", in which he sets out \" to present in organised form the classes\nof evidence gathered by psychical research, with typical examples of each \".\nNaturally in an article of 33 pages Dr Murphy has had to leave part of the\nfield unsurveyed. Thus he does not discuss physical phenomena. It\nwould be of great interest if in some later article he would tell us what he\nthinks of these, and what bearing, if any, he believes them to have on\nsurvival.\nThe \" mental \" phenomena, on which a belief in survival could be based,\n\fOCT.-NOV. 1946 Dr Gardner Murphy on Survival 2S1\nare passed clearly and briefly in review. Dr Murphy begins with appari-\ntions, and with the simpler types of these, in which a telepathic impulse,\narising out of the emotional crisis of dying, seems to be a sufficient explana-\ntion, provided of course that the reality of telepathy be accepted. Next\ncome the apparitional cases which do not fit so easily into the telepathic\nframework : those, for example, where there is a considerable lapse of\ntime between death and appearance, about ten weeks in one example\nwhich Dr Murphy quotes from Human Personality. It is possible that the\nearly psychical researchers were inclined to impose too narrow limits to\nthe period during which a telepathic impression, conveyed at the time of\ndeath, could lie latent in the percipient's subliminal. They did not reckon\nas telepathic crisis-cases apparitions seen more than 12 hours after death.\nSuch a limitation was admirably designed to exclude chance coincidences,\nbut so far as it was influenced, as it appears to have been, by experimental\nresults (see Phantasms I, pp. 139, 140, 201,) it provides an example of the\ncaution needed in making experimental results into yard-sticks for spon-\ntaneous evidence, where the emotional conditions are quite different, where,\nfor example, a sub -consciously received message of ill omen may encounter\nstrong resistance in its passage to consciousness. If memories can lie\ndormant, as is common experience, for many years beyond the power of\nconscious recall until some favourable conjunction of circumstances arises,\nwhy should the latency of spontaneous telepathic impressions be more\nclosely circumscribed ?\nBut if, as in the class of cases to which Dr Murphy next passes, to lapse\nof time since the agent's death is added the conveyance of information\nrelating to post-mortem affairs unknown to the percipient, or, as in the\nChaffin Will case [Proc. XXXVI, 517-524), activity and initiative on the\nagent's part, the argument for survival is stronger. This introduces a\npoint which, as Df Murphy developes his thesis in this and the two suc-\nceeding papers, is found to be central. It may be stated somewhat like\nthis : the simplest view of telepathy is of a one-way process from one\nagent to one percipient. If there is nothing more in telepathy than that,\nthere are a variety of spontaneous and mediumistic phenomena for which\nit would be reasonable to seek some other explanation. But many years\nago Mrs Sidg^vick and other investigators declared that the evidence\nbefore them pointed to a more complex view, requiring some activity on\nthe percipient's part. Recent research, and particularly recent experi-\nment, has shown that extra-sensory perception is a very complex affair\nindeed. Much of the evidence for survival which would pass muster,\nif the only alternative were telepathy of the simpler kind, has little\nvalidity in face of the view of extra-sensory perception now generally\naccepted.\nThis applies to instances of mediumistic paragnosis as well as to appari-\ntions, and can be more usefully discussed in that connection, since the\nnumber of cases of apparitions conveying information unknown to the\npercipient, or showing initiative, is too small to found an argument on,\nwhereas well-authenticated mediumistic cases of similar type are plentiful.\nOf these Dr Murphy cites several, calling special attention to the proxy\nsittings with Mrs Leonard, the cross-correspondences and the \" Ear of\nDionysius \".\n\fJournal of Society for Psychical Research oct-nov. 1946\nTowards the end of this article (pp. 33, 34) Dr Murphy writes :\nTelepathy has shown the reality within the organism of capacities\nwhich are not to be expected on any ordinary physical basis, and pre-\ncognition has shown the ability of the organism to transcend its usual\nrelations within the environment. These capacities strongly suggest,\nthen, that personality is not the assemblage of physical energies, pure\nand simple, which the more naive scientific approach would suggest . . .\nAs far as survival is concerned, such an argument may ultimately prove\nto be a boomerang in the sense that the discovery of wider and deeper\npowers within the depths of the living self may show the capacity of the\nindividual to produce, when strongly motivated, the most fantastically\ncomplex types of survival evidence.\nIt may, on the other hand, as Dr Murphy points out, \" well mean that\ncertain aspects, or capacities of the individual, if not the entire personality,\nmay extend beyond the physical existence of the organism .\"\nIn his second article, \" Difficulties Confronting the Survival Hypo-\nthesis \"\n(pp. 67-94), Murphy considers first the biological difficulty,\nstressing the point that feeling, as well as intelligence, has its physical basis\nin the brain.\nNothing would be gained by beating the dead horse of nineteenth-\ncentury \" materialism \", a naive and one-sided statement as to the\none-way \" dependence \" of mental upon physical . . . But it is\nextremely difficult, from a biological point of view, to conceive what is\nmeant by referring to personality as independent of the living organism\n\u2014\nso as to survive beyond death\u2014for the living organism is a psycho-\nphysical unity. (P. 70).\nHe next raises what he calls \" the Cultural Difficulty \", that \" our\npersonalities are in large measure patterns of response to a given social\nenvironment ... If, as we exist after death, we are interchangeable with\nthe personalities\u2014the memories, thoughts, interests\u2014of Iroquois Indians\nor prehistoric Chinese, or are without any definite memories or interests\nat all, this is personal survival only by a sort of play upon words\". (P. 72).\nGiven a choice between these two \" ifs \", most Westerners would accept\nthe conclusion, but is there any reason for thus limiting the possibilities?\nThe view usually expressed in communications is, I think, that the dis-\ncarnate personality first makes contact with friends, relations and other\npersons who have had more or less the same earthly experiences, and thus\nacquires a wider experience fitting it to make contact with wider groups.\nGranted the premier pas of existence unconditioned by the body, there\nseems nothing irrational in this conception.\nFrom the difficulties of supposing survival to occur, Dr Murphy passes\nto the difficulties of finding satisfactory evidence for it, i.e. evidence\nwhich does not fit some other hypothesis as well or better. He emphasises\nthe histrionic propensity of the dissociated mind, and illustrates some of\nthe resulting absurdities, such as messages from Myers that make him talk\nlike an illiterate. If the subliminals of agent and percipient can co-\noperate to stage dramas as elaborate and vivid as Mr Tyrrell's theory of\n\fOCT.-NOV. 1946 Dr Gardner MurpJiy on Survival 259\ncrisis-apparitions requires, could not a lilce interplay between the sub-\nlimiiials of medium and sitter produce equally life-like impersonations of\ndead friends of the sitter, even though these had during their life been un-\nacquainted with the medium? This is not an easy question to answer. It\nwould require detailed discussion of numerous instances. The test case\nwould not be one where a few of the \" communicator's \" mannerisms of\nspeech and gesture are reproduced : that should count for little. It is\nanother matter where a critical sitter comes away with a feeling that he has\nhad just such a conversation with the \" communicator \"as he might have\nhad during the latter's life, or where in a series of several sittings the\n\" communicator \" never speaks out of character. Such cases have been\nreported, but they are not amenable to independent assessment.\nWhen the theory of cross-correspondences was first debated, it was\nsuggested that there was no need to look outside the S.P.R. group of\nautomatists to find a mind capable of designing them, since Mrs Verrall,\nthe first in time of the group, had all the literary knowledge requisite.\nDr Murphy is inclined to favour this view, pointing out (p. 84) that \" the\nMyers communications, as well as the communications from Dr Verrall,\nbecame much less impressive after the death of Mrs Verrall \".\nDr Murphy puts his case very fairly, and with much that he says I am\nin agreement. It is difficult to discuss such a complex mass as the scripts\nof the S.P.R. group without going into tedious detail, but perhaps the\nfollowing brief outline will help towards an understanding of the problem.\nThe scripts of the S.P.R. group cover a period of about thirty years, i.e.\n1 90 1 to 1930 or later. Mrs Verrall 's death occurred about half-way\nthrough this period, in 19 16. Some of the later automatists, notably Mrs\nWilson, never knew Mrs Verrall personally. Those who were most\nfamiliar with the later scripts would not, I think, have considered them as\ninferior to the scripts produced during Mrs Verrall's life in evidence of\nplanning, or in the impressiveness of the \" communications \". So far as my\nlimited knowledge of the later scripts goes, I should be disposed to concur.\nIn passing it should be noted that, both before and after Mrs Verrall's\ndeath, there were several communicators besides Myers and her husband,\nsome of whom were never personally known to her.\nDuring the middle decade of the scripts, there was undoubtedly some\nchange in their content. The scripts could hardly have grown in quantity\nas they did, without a corresponding branching out of the design, which\nmade the later cross-correspondences very different from the earlier ones ;\nmuch less closely knit, and much more difficult both for a commentator to\nexpound in print and for a reader to follow. Nor was Mrs Verrall's death\nthe only event in this decade having a bearing on the development of the\nscripts. In particular there was the outbreak in 1914 of the First World\nWar. Both the widening out of the pattern and the influence of public\nevents had become manifest in the scripts of the various automatists\nwritten before Mrs Verrall's death, as may be seen from, e.g. Mr Pidding-\nton's paper in Vol. XXXIII of Proceedings.\nSuch factors had, I would suggest, a greater influence than Mrs Verrall's\ndeath in producing those features that distinguish the later scripts from\nthe relatively simple affairs on which Miss Johnson based her theory.\nSome of the difficulties of attributing to Mrs Verrall the authorship of\n\f260 Journal of Society for Psychical Research OCT.-NOV. 1946\nthe \" literary puzzle \" of the \" Ear of Dionysius \" I have discussed in the\nJournal of the A.S.P.R. for January 1946. No-one who has read the many\narticles on scripts of the S.P.R. group in our Proceedings will claim that\nthe problem of their inspiration is free from difficulty, but I am quite\ncertain that neither Mrs Verrall's conscious nor sub-conscious mind can be\nheld responsible for the entirety of the design embodied in them.\nIt may seem rash to speak as positively as this when, as Mr Tyrrell has\nshown, a percipient's subconscious mind can, in conjunction with the\nagent's subconscious, work up facts unknown to the percipients' conscious-\nness into an elaborately dramatic hallucination. But between the planning\ninvolved in this and that required for the cross-correspondences there is an\nimportant difference, arising partly from the much greater complexity of\nthe latter, the number of persons involved, and the length of time over\nwhich they developed. Still more fundamental is the fact that veridical\nhallucinations and cross-correspondences show every sign of aiming at\ndiametrically opposite results. The apparent purpose of the former is the\nenlightenment of the percipient : the apparent aim of the latter to mystify\neveryone concerned, an aim in which for many years they were eminently\nsuccessful.\nIn his third article, \" Field Theory and Survival \" (October 1945), Dr\nMurphy points out that in several branches of science workers have found\nthat fundamental problems cannot be approached so long as big events are\nrecorded \" as summations of little events \" :\n\" the structural whole is not\nthe sum of the parts, and the attempt to state its problems in terms of\nparts confuses the issue \"\n(p. 195). He illustrates the development of\nfield theory in physics, biology and normal psychology, and mentions\nthe approaches to such a theory in psychical research on the part of Myers,\nMrs Sidgwick, Warcollier and others. The time, he suggests, is ripe for\nits extended application to the questions of telepathy, mediumship,\npsychokinesis, etc.\nDr Murphy has perhaps cast his net rather more widely than our present\nknowledge warrants. He speaks, for instance, of \" the frequency of collec-\ntive veridical impressions \", whereas the rarity of cases which are both\ncollective and veridical seems to me much more striking. For a like\nreason it might at present be desirable to avoid unnecessary complication\nof the problem by bringing in phenomena involving \" contact with remote\npoints of time \". Retrocognition of remote past events practically depends\non An Adventure, a book which proves nothing except the muddle that in-\nevitably follows when even the best-meaning and most intelligent people\nneglect ordinary precautions as to making contemporary records of their\nimpressions. There are a fair number of cases of spontaneous pre-\ncognition (see, for example, Saltmarsh's Foreknowledge) for which neither\nnormal inference nor chance coincidence seems adequately to account.\nFor the most part the interval between prediction and fulfilment is a few\nhours or days. Precognition of remote events, as in the case from\nProceedings, XI, 577, quoted by Saltmarsh (p. 47), where the detailed\ncircumstances of a death were dreamt three times before its occurrence,\nsix years before it on the first occasion, seems to be very rare. I am inclined\nto doubt whether the present evidence for spontaneous non-inferential pre-\ncognition is strong enough to carry much superstructure of theory.\n\fOCT.-NOV. 1946 Dr Gardner Murphy on Survival\nThere remain, of course, the striking results of recent experiment, which,\nas Dr Murphy points out, form a curious contrast to the general run of\nspontaneous paragnosis, which is \" very likely to occur in relaxed states\nwhere the ego is ill-defined \" in that they \" often show us a tense individual\ncompeting strenuously with other individuals, consciousness of self\nseeming to be at a high level \". Important as the advances in experimental\nE.S.P. have been, even more perhaps will need to be done before they can,\nfor purposes of theory, be assumed to be expressions of forces identical\nwith, or having the same scope as, those that operate in spontaneous and\nmediumistic paragnosis.\nSuch a narrowing of the subject matter under review would not, how-\never, touch Dr Murphy's argument for \" an interpersonal psychical field\n\"\nof deep-level psychic interaction, in which, \" if, on independent grounds,\nthere is reason to believe the discarnate exist and are capable of contact\nwith the living \" there would be no theoretical difficulty involved in their\nparticipating jointly with the living (p. 199). After pointing out that \" the\ninterdependence of personalities does not imply the absence of individual-\nity \" but that \" no personality can fail to exert some interpersonal effects,\nnor can it exist solely in and through itself\", Dr Murphy observes that the\nquestion whether personality survives bodily death \" presupposes a\nrigidity, a sharpness, a distinctiveness, an encapsulation, which simply is\nnot an attribute of the thing we know as personality \"\n(pp. 201, 202).\nWhile it would seem that even before death the deep-level aspect of the\nself is in some degree interpersonal, \" it is likely that biological individual-\nity involves some binding or restraining influence at work in the organism\nwhich keeps even the deepest activity from becoming fully interpersonal.\"\nDeath therefore \" facilitates the process of articulation between selves\n\"\n(pp. 204, 205), in what Dr Murphy has described (p. 202) as \" a single\ngreat context \", which incorporates all the psychological processes of the\npast, and with which \" our present activity is in touch and to which it\nmakes its own infinitesimal contribution \".\nOn this view every individual is before bodily death a constituent\nmember of an interpersonal group, of which after bodily death he still\nremains a member, inasmuch as his past activities influence the present\nactivities of the group : there is nothing, of course, novel so far. But\nthere is, on this view, the further complication, to which psychical research\nhas pointed with increasing force, that the deep-level paragnostic powers\nof the living members of the group, and their propensity to subliminal\ndramatization, might work together to endow a \" static surviving entity\n\"\nwith a delusive appearance of activity. How is the enquirer to distinguish\nthis fictitious activity from a state in which the surviving entities would\nretain their individual memories and purposes and perhaps \" interact con-\ntinuously with the deep-level activity of the living \"? It may not be super-\nfluous to emphasise at this stage that the \" static \" and \" active \" concep-\ntions are not contradictory or mutually exclusive, so that in any particular\ncase evidence suggesting a \" static \" view, either in its simpler or more\nsophisticated form, would not rebut or negative other evidence pointing\nto a more active form of survival.\nDr Murphy indicates (pp. 206-208) three types of evidence as of the\nhighest importance :\n\f262 Journal of Society for Psychical Research OCT.-Nov. 1946\n1. \" Evidence regarding the actual scope of the paranormal powers of\nthe living \" through which \" we might find in what degree purporting\nsurvival evidence is a function of interpersonal activities attributable to the\nliving. Highly important in such an enterprise would be the discovery\nof cases of collective veridical hallucinations occurring long after death,\nhence pointing to the probability of activity on the part of the deceased\nrather than to activities assignable to a group of living persons \". The\nunsatisfactory state of the existing evidence for collective veridical impres-\nsions has already been mentioned.\nAttempts to devise experiments capable of distinguishing the sub-\nliminal activities of the living from action by the discarnate encounter a\nrather curious difficulty. The biologist experimenting with a rabbit can\nusually be sure that he, and not the rabbit or some third party, is the\nexperimenter. The psychical researcher does not enjoy such certainty.\nNothing could apparently have been simpler than Verrall's One Horse\nDazcti experiment, {Proc, Vol. XX), but it developed so oddly as to\nleave it still a matter of debate who was experimenting with whom : see\nProc, Vol. XXX, p. 75. Again, to diverge from experiment, for how\nmuch of the \" Sevens Case \" {Proc, Vol. XXIV) was the ostensible\ninitiator, Mr Piddington, responsible? This is not written to discourage\nexperiment in a direction where it is badly needed, but to remind the\nresearcher of a difficulty peculiar to deep-level psychic experiment.\n2. Dr Murphy writes :\nAnother type of evidence which would bear directly upon the problem\nwould be a type of mediumistic material in which a communicator\nwould assume the form under which he was known some time prior to\nhis decease, rather than the form in which he was known at the time of\nhis death. . . . The critical question is to find out by one means or\nanother whether contact is made retrocognitively with the diff\"erent\nperiods of the communicator's life, or only with the personality as it was\nat the end of life. If only the latter kind of evidence appears, the fact\nmust count against the retrocognition theory.\n3. The third type of evidence, which seems to Dr Murphy the most\nimportant, is where there is not only apparent purpose taking shape in\none communicator's mind after his death, but where, as in the Ear of\nDionysius case,\nthe communications make sense in terms of a plan worked out by them\n[i.e. Butcher and Verrall] post-tnortem. If the reader will make the\nattempt at a systematic interpretation of this case as expressing only the\nsubconscious paranormal activity of the living, he will find the task of\nintroducing Henry Butcher's part in the plot excruciatingly difficult.\nDr Murphy's field-theory will not, of course, find acceptance with those\nwho still reject telepathy, but the time has surely come when such persons\nshould be asked pointedly whether they have studied the evidence, and, if\nso, whether they have judged it by the same standards as they would apply\nto other manifestations of the human mind.\nOthers of his readers may feel disappointed that, of the great mass of\nevidence often adduced in discussions on survival, so little is found to\n\ft\nOCT.-Nov. 1946 Reviews 263\npass Dr Murphy's sieve. But Dr Murphy's main object, if I understand\nhim. aright, is to point out promising Hnes for future enquiry : most\nreasonable people in coming to a conclusion on a mass of evidence,\nwhether relating to survival or any other problem, first eliminate all that\nseems to them factually unsound, or demonstrably beside the point :\nthey base their judgment on the whole residue, including much that is\nsusceptible of more than one interpretation, and make such adjustments\nand allowances as they can for greater or lesser degrees of ambiguity.\nIn applying this process to the particular problem of survival, it is well to\nbear in mind Mrs Sidgwick's observation {Proc, Vol. XLI, p. 26), \" Con-\nclusive proof of survival is notoriously difficult to obtain. But the evidence\nmay be such as to produce belief, even though it fall short of conclusive\nproof.''\nAnd here one notes the impartiality of Dr Murphy's sieve. Much of\nthe traditional argument on both sides of the survivalist controversy is\ndiscarded. On the one hand much traditional evidence for survival fails\nto pass his test as evidence for active survival. On the other hand the\nsupposed \" antecedent improbability \" of survival, based on the limitations\nof the individual body, and sometimes alleged to be so strong as to negative\nany evidence the survivalist could produce, is shown to be beside the\npoint. The evidence can now be judged on its merits, and that is in itself\na noteworthy advance.\nLike any other field, the \" psychic field \" will need exploration, and it is to\nbe hoped that Dr Murphy will follow up these three articles by others\nequally conducive to an understanding of what to many psychical research-\ners remains their central problem.\nW. H. S.\nREVIEWS\nBucH DER Erinnerung. By Max Dessoir. Pp. VI 306. Stuttgart, 1946.\nThis book, which has been published by permission of the Military\nGovernment in Germany, is not in any sense an autobiography. It is\nrather a gathering together of memories and impressions which Dr Dessoir\nhas collected during a lifetime of almost eighty years. A philosopher,\npsychologist and psychical researcher, Dessoir here brings together his\nscattered thoughts, and the result must be of considerable interest to those\nwho wish to see how a trained mind regards men and affairs in the troubled\ntimes in which we live.\nDuring the war Dessoir seems to have lived quietly, although signs were\nnot lacking that at any moment he might disappear under the Nazi terror.\nIt was not until August 1943 that he left Berlin ; and in November of the\nsame year his house there was destroyed by bombs and fire under the\nAllied attacks.\nIn reading the book the psychical researcher may pass over the author's\naccount of his early days and his description of the main trends in German\nthought from 1890 until the First World War. He points out how the\ndesire for security, coupled with the longing for more absolute values,\ndominated sections of the German population, and how they affected the\nsociety of the period. The search for truth led the inquirer into strange\n\f264 Journal of Society for Psychical Research OCT.-NOV. 1946\npaths, and thus Dessoir himself became interested in parapsychology, and\nabove all in the personalities of those engaged in it. He was quick to\nrealise the personal ambitions of Schrenck-Notzing, and soon suspected\nthat the Munich sittings were social events rather than scientific investiga-\ntions. The Baron's charm captivated his visitors, and with women his\nsuccess was immediate and striking.\nAfter summing up the characteristics of Germany's most famous\npsychical researcher, and passing over lightly such figures as Marion,\nwhom he puts in the same class as Hanussen, he turns to the leading\npersonalities in England. He was much attracted to Edmund Gurney, the\nman with the \" very blue-blue eyes \", not only from their mutual interest\nin psychical research but also for their love of music. Podmore he found\ngay and teasing, a striking contrast to the more serious Myers. In 1934\nDessoir found Mrs Sidgwick almost unchanged, and he recalls meeting\nher in her London club. He describes her as incisive and clear-headed,\nlistening attentively to all that was said and adding her own comments\nwhen she thought it desirable. As to Miss Newton, he soon summed her up\nin one sentence. She was, he declares, the embodiment of competence and\nreliability.\nIt is only when we come to Dessoir's judgment of his own contempor-\naries in Germany and Austria that we are somewhat disappointed. Apart\nfrom a note on the bitter struggle between Schrenck-Notzing and his\nfellow researchers, there is little regarding the critical school of such\nwriters as Rosenbusch and Klinckowstroem. Perhaps parapsychology\nplayed too small a part in Dessoir's life for its details to be remembered ;\nand it must not be forgotten that he was one of those who failed to be con-\nvinced of the reality of much which had been shown to him. He was, it\nappears, to remain a sceptic and as such we must leave him.\nE. J. Dingwall\nDer Begriff als Psychisches Erlebnis. By Dr Gustav Lebzeltern.\n(Leykam, Graz-Wien. 1946).\nThis book is a brief contribution to the subject which the Germans call\nDenkpsychologie, or Psychology of Thinking, and is a praiseworthy attempt\nto revive and continue the work of the Kiilpe school. It has no direct\nconcern with paranormal phenomena ; but students of Telepathy may be\ninterested in the author's discussion of the relation between concepts and\nimages, though it appears to the reviewer that the part played by words in\n\" normal \" conceptual cognition is somewhat underrated.\nH.

I reached Malvern the same afternoon and interviewed a\nnumber of persons who had witnessed various phenomena during recent\nweeks. In view of the number and variety of the incidents and the brevity\nof the time at my disposal\u2014two days\u2014I thought it best to concentrate\nmy attention on two or three of the more striking phenomena alleged to\nhave taken place. Two of these incidents I described in detail and\nforwarded the report with the signatures of the witnesses and carefully\ndrawn plans, to the secretary of the S.P.R. As this report and nearly all\nthe papers connected with it were apparently mislaid, I venture to offer\nfor publication in the Journal a second account of one of these Malvern\nexperiences which I have been able to put together from the rough notes\nof the original report which I have by chance discovered quite recently.\nOn reaching Malvern I was received with great kindness by Miss\nClancy, the occupier of the house in question. I spent an hour or two\nwalking about the house and seeing the particular places where the alleged\nphenomena had occurred. After tea Miss Clancy was good enough to\ncall together nearly all the witnesses of the poltergeist happenings, in-\ncluding a well-known doctor in West Malvern. First hand evidence, both\nindividual and collective, was forthcoming for alleged phenomena in\nvarious parts of the house\u2014most of them in full daylight\u2014inexplicable\nmovements of various objects, cooking utensils, plates, dishes, brooms,\netc. I thought it best, as I have said, to concentrate on the evidence for\ntwo striking incidents which had occurred in the kitchen and the pantry.\nAll the alleged phenomena had taken place during the presence in the\nhouse of a Mrs Collins, one of the domestic staff, and ceased completely\nwhen she subsequently left Miss Clancy's employment.\nI give herewith a summary of what had taken place in the kitchen on a\nrecent occasion when Miss Clancy had called in a plumber in order to find\n\f266 Journal of Society for P~sychical Research December, 1946\nout whether by chance any arrangement of the pipes or of the large kitchen\nrange could contribute to vibrations in the kitchen which might help to\nexplain the frequent movement and fall of pots, pans, dishes, etc. The\nplumber had entered the kitchen in good light accompanied by Miss\nClancy, Miss Marjorie Robins and Mrs Parry ; Mrs Collins and Miss\nWoodhouse, two members of the kitchen staff, were already there. As the\nplumber, Mr Lawday, was advancing towards the large kitchen range,\nLARGE FIRE PLACE\nPoker suspended\nfrom nail\nDRESSER\n\/bElectric\nlamp\nMrs Collins\nX\nY Lawday\n(plumber)\nX\n; n\no\no\na.\nX X X\nValerie\nJa)\nnow\nMrs\nMarjorie\n1\n(MiS!\nj.\nM.\nClar\n(Miss)\nr\n(Miss;\nParry\n0\na-\n0\nn\nPlumber's mate\nX\nn XL\nDOOR\nThe witnesses were facing the fireplace on the opposite side of the\ntable. The plumber was advancing towards the fireplace. Mrs Collins,\nthe apparent centre and focus of these phenomena, was moving forward\nat the end of the table.\nwhich was faced by the other five persons, a poker suspended from a hook\nto the right of the range, appeared to detach itself from the hook and\nrose in the air, pass in a curving flight some ten or twelve feet long over\nthe top of the electric lamp suspended above the kitchen table and fell\npoint downwards on the edge of the table opposite to Mrs Collins ; it\ndented the surface of the table and fell to the floor. This phenomenon was\nwitnessed therefore by six persons who appended their signatures to my\n\fDECEMBER, 1 946 A Malvern Poltergeist 267\noriginal account. The plumber's mate, advancing at that moment through\na door at the back of the kitchen, witnessed the occurrence, and subse-\nquently added his signature to the statement.\nThe enclosed sketch makes the position of the witnesses, etc., clear.\nI venture to think that this case is well worthy of record by the Society.\nI am well acquainted with accounts of poltergeist happenings in our\nProceedings and Journal and I do not think we have a single case to equal\nthe one I have described as regards the quantity and quality of the evidence\nand the good conditions existing at the time for clear observation. I have\nin my time witnessed alleged poltergeist phenomena, usually of an\nobviously fraudulent character or of dubious authenticity, but I find it\nvery difficult to suggest any normal explanation for this happening in the\nMalvern kitchen. I may say that the plumber's investigation revealed no\npossible solution of the mystery. The witnesses were completely baffled\nand could only repeat the remark made by Dr Shakespeare of Malvern\nabout a similar phenomenon, witnessed by himself in the house, that\n\" seeing is believing \". The statements of later cases follow.\n\" On the last week of January 1942, about 2.30 p.m. in good light, we,\nthe undersigned, were present in the kitchen of Clarence Nursing Home,\nGraham Road, Malvern, Worcs. While we were all facing the kitchen\nrange, the poker, suspended from a nail at the side of the range, detached\nitself from the nail, and passed over the suspended electric lamp. It struck\nthe kitchen table point downwards near to Mrs Collins, and made a clearly\nvisible dent in the top of the table. It then fell down to the floor.\nSigned :\nJulie M. Clancy (A.R.R.S., S.R.N., C.M.B., Matron) \".\nIdentical statements have been obtained from Miss Marjorie Robins\n(Sister), Mr Lawday, the plumber, Mrs Valerie Parry (formerly Miss Jay)\nand Mr C. J. Ashwin (plumber's assistant). Mrs Collins and Miss Wood-\nhouse signed my original report, but I have been unable to obtain fresh\nsignatures from them as their present whereabouts cannot be traced.\nE. N. Bennett\nREPORT ON SOME CARD-GUESSING EXPERIMENTS\nWITH A PROMISING PERCIPIENT\nD. J. West\nAbstract : Guessing experiments with Zener cards in which Mr\nF. W. Masham acted as percipient were reported to the Society as having\nyielded positive results. A long series of card guesses was carried out at\nthe S.P.R. rooms with this percipient, but the results were entirely\nconsistent with the chance hypothesis.\nIn March 1944 a member of the Society reported the results of a short\nseries of Zener card trials with Mr F. W. Masham acting as percipient.\nThe trials were arranged in runs of 30, and two runs were performed on\neach of three evenings. The experimenter and percipient were in their\nrespective houses. With watches synchronised by means of the B.B.C.\ntime signal the experimenter changed the target, and the percipient\nrecorded his guesses at |-minute intervals.\n\f268 Journal of Society for Psychicai Research December, 1946\nAs originally reported, these distance trials with Masham were indicative\nof genuinely positive scoring on the card two ahead\u2014that is plus 2 displace-\nment such as was observed with Basil Shackleton. In Oct. 1946 the\noriginal score sheets were given to the Research Officer, who checked the\nfigures and discovered a number of errors which greatly reduced the\nsignificance of the observations. The corrected result was as follows :\nDisplacement Scores\nDate - 2 - I 0 + I + 2 N\n21\/6\/43 21 8 8 13 20 60\n23\/6\/43 9 17 12 9 17 60\n25\/6\/43 15 12 10 7 II 60\nTotal 45 37 30 29 48 180\nExpt'n 34-8 35-4 36 35-4 34-8\nC.R. + 1-93 + 0-30 - I -12 - I -20 + 2-5\nExpt'n 176-4\nC. R. + I -06\nThere remains some slight suggestion of an effect in the plus 2 and\nminus 2 positions. Unfortunately, the target cards had not been governed\naccording to a shuffled pack or a prepared random sequence ;\nthey were\nchosen mentally by the experimenter. An analysis was carried out to see\nif there was any evidence that the plus 2 and minus 2 scores were due to\nsimilar card preferences, or guessing habits in experimenter or percipient.\nIt was found that the chance expectations were not materially affected by\ncard preferences. (See Appendix I) ^.\nIn 1946 Mr Masham tried some informal guessing experiments working\nalone in his own home. At first he thought he was getting some success,\nbut when he took certain precautions which I suggested the results\nbecame entirely consistent with chance.\nIn June 1946 when guessing sessions began at the S.P.R. rooms, both\nMr Masham, who acted as a percipient, and the Research Officer, who\nwas experimenter and chief agent, were optimistically expecting good\nresults. Seemingly positive results had already been reported, and Mr\nMasham thought he was getting results at home. The percipient was in fact\nparticularly keen and confident, feeling that it was only a matter of finding\nthe right conditions to enable him to work successfully. If positive\nsuggestion were productive of success we should have had excellent\nresults. , . \u2022\njij, ! - \u2022\n'\n.\n1 The statistical analyses contained in the appendices to this report, being all\ncompletely negative in their findings, are not printed in The Journal. They have\nbeen placed in the Society's files, and may be consulted on application.\n\fDECEMBER, 1 946 Report on Card-guessing Experiments 269\nThe first four sessions were devoted to working under telepathic\nconditions with a counter machine h'ke that described by Mr Parsons^.\nThe result was: \u2022\n-\nequals 1000. Expt'n equals 200. Obs. equals 206. (For full result\nsee Appendix II.)\n.\nIn the rest of the series Zener card symbols were employed. As nothing\npositive was obtained, it is scarcely necessary to describe the conditions\nof each session. The scoring arrangements were always adequate. In\nnearly all cases the targets were determined by a random sequence\nprepared from 7-figure logs by the Research Officer. Most of the experi-\nments were witnessed. Full details are on record with the original score\nsheets in the S.P.R. files.\nThe following table summarises the results :\nTABLE SHOWING SCORE\/EXPT'N\nDate Agent N - 2 - I 0 + I + 2\n30\/7\/46 D.

It was thought at first that it might be D. J. W. who was a\npoor agent. On the sessions 29\/8\/46 and 12\/9\/46 members of the S.P.R.\nWorking Group acted as agents. There were seven agents, and each did\n200 trials. On 24\/9\/46 and 22\/10\/46 250 trials were carried out with the\nbest scoring agent from the Working Group. On 3\/9\/46 and 7\/9\/46 two\nmore agents were tried. On 17\/9\/46 and 29\/10\/46 the agent who had\nreported the 1943 results tried to reproduce his earlier successes. In the\nsubdivisions of these sessions marked {b) agent and percipient were on\nseparate floors, and the guesses were made at ^-minute intervals, in order\nto simulate as closely as possible the circumstances of the 1943 experiment.\nNone of the agents succeeded in producing any positive results.\n^ Proc. S.P.R. xlviii, 27. \u2022 ' '\n'\n'\n\f270 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December, 1946\nIn some sessions the speed of guessing was varied, but with no effect on\nthe results. It was suggested that D. J. W. might be exerting an inhibiting\ninfluence, but on certain occasions (e.g. session 22\/10\/46) when he deUber-\nately absented himself, results were still chance.\nIt is difficult to say without very careful examination that there is no\nextra-chance effect in a given set of data. Dr Rhine and his collaborators\nhave recorded so many effects (decline, salience, non-random success\ndistribution, etc.) which might not reveal themselves in a table of gross\nscores. Mr Masham preserved his confidence that some sort of result\nwould be discovered until very near the end of the experiment. Appen-\ndices III onwards show the results of analyses for some of the effects that\nhave been attributed to E.S.P. They are all completely negative.\nIf we are to draw any conclusion from this disappointing experiment\nit is that a person who does not possess the aptitude for card guessing\ncannot produce results, no matter how confident he and the experimenters\nmay be, and no matter who acts as agent.\nThe fact that such a large body of data conforms so well to chance\nexpectation in all respects, is in some measure an empirical check on the\nvalidity of the statistical analyses employed. That card guessing methods\ndo produce consistent chance scores, makes the consistent extra-chance\nscores observed in Basil Shackleton and others all the more convincing.\nBefore closing, I must record my great indebtedness to Mr Masham\nfor his patient co-operation and many helpful suggestions.\nREPORT ON THE QUESTIONNAIRE\nThe 185 replies to the questionnaire sent to members in February 1946\nhave now been analysed. Our thanks are due to a member, Mrs H.\nSendall, who undertook this work.\nQuestions i and 2 referred to the times of meetings. Mid-week\nevenings not earlier than 6.30 seemed to be the choice of the majority.\nQuestion 3 showed that lectures and discussions were almost equally\npopular.\nQuestion 4 asked members to suggest subjects for lectures or discussions.\nA large number of suggestions were made ranging from Black Magic,\nYoga, and Symbolism, to Apports, Telekinesis, Survival, and Statistics,\nand efforts will be made to arrange talks on many of the subjects suggested.\nQuestion 5 asked members to state which branches of psychical research\ninterested them most. The voting is interesting : Telepathy (115 votes),\nPrecognition (106), Clairvoyance (99), Communications from the Dead\n(91), Psychological Aspects (90), Experimental E.S.P. (78), Medical\nAspects (73), Apparitions and Visions (72), Hauntings (62), Physical\nPhenomena (61), Hypnotism (54), Automatic Writing (50), Poltergeists\n(48), Spirit Photography (27).\nAnswers to Question 6 showed that many members had had personal\nexperience of one or more of the above branches of psychical research.\n\fDECEMBER, 1 946 Report on the Questionnaire 271\nQuestion 7 asked : Would you like to assist in the formation of a\nLondon Group for\n{a) The study of mediumship ?\n{b) Experimental E.S. P.?\n(c) Any other experimental work?\nThe names of 80 members who replied have been carefully noted and\nthey will be informed as soon as it is possible to organise groups. Some\nmembers suggested subjects for investigation.\nQuestion 8 asked for details of specialised training possessed by\nmembers. The information given in the replies will be extremely useful\nto the Research Officer.\nIn Question 9 an offer was made to supply a leaflet recommending a\nmethod of annotating and appraising the material obtained at sittings.\nThis leaflet is now being prepared by a special committee.\nQuestion 12 asked if members would be willing to participate in postal\nE.S. P. experiments. 114 members answered affirmatively. If any\nmember is willing to organise postal experiments, would he communicate\nwith the Research Officer, who has made a note of these names?\nQuestion 13 asked for volunteers to read and collate printed material.\nThe response was very gratifying, and the 72 volunteers have been\ncarefully noted.\nQuestion 14 asked for the names of local groups or societies who would\nlike to have a lecture on psychical research. Four names were received\nand probably others will come in from time to time. The Council will\nmake every effort to meet the demand.\nQuestion 15 invited further suggestions and many were received on\nmany subjects : they are being carefully considered. There is evidently\na wish in many places for the formation of local groups. The increasing\nmembership and the circulation of the printed list of members should\nmake it easier for members to get in touch with each other in the districts\nwhere they live. Such groups might be of the greatest help in investigating\nphenomena in localities which it would be difficult for the Research Officer\nto visit.\nD. Parsons\nREVIEW\nThe End of Borley Rectory. By Harry Price. Pp. 358. London :\nGeorge G. Harrap & Co., 1946.\nMr Harry Price has produced yet another very lively and readable\nbook about Borley Rectory. As might be expected the book is illustrated\nwith a large number of excellent photographs and plans. There is also a\npreface in which handsome acknowledgment is made to a large number of\ndistinguished persons who have in some way or other been connected\nwith the Borley literature and have, in a few instances, taken a useful part\nin investigating the phenomena. Among these latter, honourable mention\nmust be made of Dr A. J. B. Robertson who with a party of Cambridge\nfriends made careful observations at various times between the fire in 1939\n\f272 Jotmial of Society for Psychical Research December, 1946\nand the demolition of the Rectory in 1944. Dr Robertson, it will be\nremembered, read a paper on his observations at a meeting of the Society\nin November 1944, and a summary of it was printed in the January-\nFebruary issue of the Journal for 1945. Another important document is\nthe letter printed on pp. 99 and 100 from Mr P. Shaw Jeffrey, M.A. (Oxon)\nfrom Cape Town. He explains that he was a contemporary of Harry Bull\nat Oxford and in the Long Vacation used to stay with him at Borley, being\nthere in 1885 and 1886. The Bull family was extremely numerous,\nconsisting, according to Mr Jeffrey's recollection, of seventeen, but\naccording to statements of members of the family, fourteen children.\n\" There were so many that they went about in cliques and the different\ncliques were only dimly aware of each other.\" Harry and three others\nwhom he names formed his clique. \" I had lots of small adventures at the\nRectory. Stones falling about, my boots found on top of the wardrobe,\netc., etc., and I saw the nun several times and often heard the coach go\nclattering by. But the big adventure that would have been worth your\nwhile recording was one time when I missed a big French dictionary\nwhich I had been regularly using for some days. Nobody could find it,\nbut one night I was awakened by a big bump on the floor, and there was\nthe dictionary (after I had lit my candle), with its back a good deal knocked\nabout, sprawling on the floor. My bedroom door was \/orfo-^\/. \" Mr Jeffrey\nalso describes a very startling incident of a poltergeist nature which he\nwitnessed in the company of Harry Bull at a neighbouring rectory where\nan uncle of Harry Bull's lived.\nIt is obvious that a large house in the depths of the country, inhabited\nby a crowd of young people divided into cliques only dimly aware of the\nother cliques' doings, provided exactly the right stage for mysteries and\nhoaxes of every description. Mr Jeffrey's letter furnishes evidence, which\nwas not available when I reviewed The Most Haunted House in England\nin 1940, that there was a tradition for poltergeist phenomena as well as\napparitions going back as far as the Rev. Henry Bull's incumbency.\nBut neither Mr Jeffrey's letter nor Dr Robertson's observations can\ndiminish our regret that Mr Price took so little advantage of the oppor-\ntunities afforded by \" the most haunted house in England \" to share the\ninvestigation of the house while it was still standing with other researchers\nwhose: training in that particular line of enquiry might fairly have been\nconsidered sufficient to justify their being invited.\nW.
