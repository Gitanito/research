He has adopted&nbsp;a comprehensive, multicultural and interdisciplinary approach to reincarnation studies, and has advanced a theory on how it happens, the \u2018processual soul theory\u2019.

He estimates that he has visited more than thirty nations.1\n\nMatlock earned an English BA from Emory University in 1977. He&nbsp;almost acquired a second BA in psychology, before being discouraged by the behaviourism and materialism he was being taught.&nbsp; His first ambition was to be a creative writer; he recalls dictating stories to his mother before he could write.2&nbsp; Unable to progress at fiction he visited his local library in Arlington, Virginia, in search of ideas for non-fiction writing and encountered books about reincarnation, a topic he had previously been intrigued by.  Entrance into Parapsychology\n\nMatlock began collecting past-life regression accounts, recording each&nbsp;in detail on an index card.&nbsp; He noticed books by Ian Stevenson in the library stacks, but left them until he had finished his analysis of the regression accounts. When he turned to Stevenson he was impressed by the scientific rigour of work carried out in his field research&nbsp;on spontaneous cases,&nbsp;with its emphasis on careful investigation and documentation of evidence, and verification of claimed past-life memories.&nbsp;Matlock decided to adopt a similarly scientific approach. He became involved with parapsychology, subscribing to journals and attending conferences.3  Library Science\n\nIn 1983, Matlock began post-graduate work in library science at the University of Maryland, concentrating in archives. He received his MLS in 1985 and was offered the job of Librarian and Archivist with the American Society for Psychical Research (ASPR) in New York.&nbsp;In 1989, he was commissioned to organize the collection of JB Rhine\u2019s Parapsychology Laboratory at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nFor his library science work Matlock wrote a survey of archival collections in parapsychology, which was later published.4 &nbsp;While working as ASPR librarian and archivist, he began writing papers on the history of parapsychology and on reincarnation.5&nbsp; He published the introduction to his inventory of Rhine\u2019s Parapsychology Laboratory Records in 1991.6  Anthropology\n\nBecoming dissatisfied with a career as an archivist, Matlock began studying for a master\u2019s degree in anthropology at Hunter College of the City University of New York.&nbsp; He received his PhD at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale&nbsp;in 2002 and in 2004 went to the Rhine Research Center in Durham, North Carolina, for two years.\n\nBy this time Matlock was married and had a daughter, Cristina.&nbsp; At the age of three she began saying she remembered a past life. He discussed her memories with her as she became older; this gave him the opportunity to test some of his ideas, and he credits these exchanges as an important influence on his thinking.7\n\nMatlock resides in Booneville, Tennessee, USA.  Reincarnation Research  Activities\n\nAt Hunter College Matlock quickly learned that tribal peoples worldwide believed in reincarnation, which in some cases informed their social customs.&nbsp; He arranged to make this the topic of all his term papers as well as his MA thesis.8 In 1990 he published a paper about reincarnation, naming and inheritance patterns among the Tlingit and Kwakuitl Indians,9 along with others taking an anthropological approach, including an index of reincarnation beliefs among North American tribal societies co-authored with anthropologist and reincarnation researcher Antonia Mills.10\n\nMatlock published on reincarnation regularly through the early 1990s, including a contribution to Stanley Krippner\u2019s Advances in Parapsychological Research 6 that outlined the findings of reincarnation research and defended them against critics.&nbsp;This paper was the first major work&nbsp;supporting the reincarnation research of Stevenson.11&nbsp;\n\nIn 2011, Matlock was invited to write a historical review of Stevenson\u2019s classic work Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation for the Journal of Scientific Exploration,12 and to teach a reincarnation course in a proposed graduate program in parapsychology at Atlantic University. The program did not come about, but Matlock completed development of the course nonetheless&nbsp;and began teaching it online in 2014 under the title \u2018Signs of Reincarnation\u2019.13\n\nIn 2014, Matlock founded the only Facebook group devoted to discussion reincarnation using the scientific approach, also titled \u2018Signs of Reincarnation\u2019, which he continues to run. It has become the largest reincarnation group on Facebook with more than 30,000 members as of this writing.\n\nIn 2016, he published a book on children\u2019s reincarnation cases in collaboration with psychologist and parapsychologist Erlendur Haraldsson, entitled I Saw A Light and Came Here: Children's Experiences of Reincarnation.&nbsp; He took part in a written debate with skeptical authors conducted by the Journal of Parapsychology in a special book review section edited by John Palmer in 2016,14 (the first major publication on survival theory undertaken by this journal). Since 2017, Matlock has contributed many articles to the Psi Encyclopedia on reincarnation and other topics (see under Works, below).&nbsp;Increasingly in recent years he has undertaken investigations of individual reincarnation cases.\n\nMatlock transformed his \u2018Signs of Reincarnation\u2019 course lectures into a book, introducing it with a strong child case he himself investigated and adding other new material, and published it in June 2019 under the title Signs of Reincarnation: Exploring Beliefs, Cases, and Theory. He considers this the culmination of his work so far.15  Processual Soul Theory\n\nMatlock retains the goal of many others in parapsychology: to convince scientists outside the field to recognize its validity and learn about its research results.&nbsp;Feeling that a theory of reincarnation was crucial for such acceptance, he&nbsp;proposed&nbsp;what he&nbsp;calls the \u2018processual soul theory\u2019, based largely on the child case data from Stevenson and other researchers, and developed within his \u2018Signs of Reincarnation\u2019 course and book.\n\nThe theory holds that what survives death is the \u2018mind\u2019, \u2018soul\u2019, \u2018psyche\u2019 or \u2018stream of consciousness\u2019, terms which Matlock uses interchangeably.&nbsp;It is comprised of both of what Frederic WH Myers called the supraliminal mind (or waking consciousness) and subliminal mind (subconscious).&nbsp;Information of all types \u2013 memories of facts and experiences, skills, habits, preferences, emotions and residues of physical injuries, which can then manifest upon reincarnation as birthmarks that resemble scars \u2013 are held permanently in the subliminal mind.&nbsp;The subliminal mind customizes each new body by psychokinetic actions affecting the genome, tissues, brain and physiological aspects, while the supraliminal mind&nbsp;undergoes a \u2018reset\u2019 upon coming into association with&nbsp;each new body, losing the ability to retrieve remembered information from prior to the start of the new life. Material from the subconscious may continue to influence behaviour, however, and from time to time may rise into conscious awareness as past-life memories.\n\nProcessual soul theory rejects retributive karma as an active mechanism, though Matlock acknowledges what he calls 'processual karma', the carryover of psychological dispositions and conflicts from one life to the next. The theory rejects&nbsp;also the possibility that reincarnation can occur between species that cannot interbreed, arguing that consciousness has evolved along with the physical body. Neither does it support New Age ideas of \u2018soul groups\u2019, detailed life planning and mandatory spiritual learning or development, evidence for which Matlock does not see in the cases he and other researchers have studied. However, it understands reincarnation to play a role in species adaptation and hence evolution.16  Current Positions\n\nMatlock has been an Associate Editor and member of the Editorial Board for the Journal of Scientific Exploration since early 2022, and has sat on the Editorial Board of the Journal of Near-Death Studies since 2020. He is also a Research Fellow with the Parapsychology Foundation, Inc.
