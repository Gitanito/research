His father, who had\nbeen a merchant, happening to die during his\ninfancy, his maternal uncles took him under\ntheir prote&ion, and endeavoured to inftrudt\nhim in the principles of religion, and give him\nan education fuitable to his years. But from his\nearlieft infancy he fhewed himfelf fo averfe to\na virtuous courfe of life, that he fled more than\nonce from the feminary of St. Roch at Pa\u00ad\nlermo, where he had been placed for his in-\nflrudtion. '\nAt the age of thirteen he was entrufted tot\nthe care ofthe father-general ofthe G o o d - B r o t b e r -\nb o c d ^ t who carried him to the conyent_of that\norder at Cartagirone. There he put on the ha\u00ad\nbit of a novice ; and, being plated under the\ntuition of the apothecary, he learned from him\nlonging to that ifland; while others, with equal probability,\naffirmed*that he was the only furviving ion of that prince\nwho about thirty-five years ago fwayed the precarious\nfeeptreof Trcbifond. To infufe into this fiory a greater\n, portion of the marvellous, it was added, that a revolution\ntaking place, in confequence of which the reigning fovereign\nwas facrificed to the fury of his feditious fubjefts, bis in-*\nfant ion, the Coiint Caglioftro, was conveyed by a truily\nfriend to Medina, where the Muflulman Sherif had the\nunprejudiced generofity to educate him in the faith of his\nChriftian parents.

It is recorded among other things*\nthat, being employed to read during meals, as\nis euftomary in all holy communities, he would\nnever repeat what appeared in the book; but,on\nthe contrary, fpoke whatever occurred to his own\nimagination 1 nay, he has even confelled that*\nin reading the Martyrology, he ufed to fubfti-\ntute the names of the moft famous Courtezans\nof the time, inftead of thofe of the faints.\nIn f\u00edne, to get rid of the mortifications and\nthe penance infli&ed upon him, on account of\nhis faults, he abandoned his convent, and re\u00ad\nturned to Palermo. '\nIt was about this period that he cultivated a\ntafte for drawing: but this neither occafioned\na change in his morals, or his conduft. The\nexceffes to which he abandoned himfelf were\nalmoft of every kind and defeription. Deliver\u00ad\ning himfelf entirely up to his paffion for fenc\u00ad\ning, and to the company of the moft difiblute\nyoung men of the neighbourhood, there was\nno quarrel in which he did not take a part: but\nB 2 a b o v e\nD\nig\nitize\ndb\ny\n\fT H E L I F E OF\n4\nabove all things he took a particular pleafure\nin refilling the officers ofjuftice, and in deliver\u00ad\ning from their hands the prifoners whom they\nhad arrefted. He was alfo accufed of having\nforged tickets of admiflion into the theatre m\nr\nand he dole from one of his uncles with whom\nhe lived, a confiderable quantity pf money,\nandfeveral valuable effeib. Having encou\u00ad\nraged an' amorous intercourfe between an ac\u00ad\nquaintance and one of hisfemale coufins, he car\u00ad\nried^billet-doux from one to the other; and, pro-\nfitingby this opportunity,made the lover believe\nthat the young lady fometimes requefted mo\u00ad\nney, -and fometimes a watch of a trinket: thef\u00a9\nprefents were accordingly confided to his care,\nand clandeftinely appropriated to h'is own ufe.\nSuch was his addrefs, that he infinuated him\u2014\nfelf into the good graces of a relation who was\na notary, and aftually found means to falfify a\nteftament in favour of a certain Marquis Mau\u00ad\nrigi, by which means great injury accrued to a\npious eftablifliment. This piece of roguery\nwas difcovered fcveral years after, at a time\nwhen he was abfent from Palermo; and proof*\nwere adduced on the occafion that clearly ma-\nnifefted his criminality. It has allb been af-\nfcrted that he aflailinated a canon} and it is pre\u00ad\ntended that, having been applied to by a monk\nt\no\nD\nig\nitize\ndb\nyGoogle\n\fCOUNT CACLIOSTRO. $\nto procure leave of abfence from his fuperior,\nhe forged a permiffion, on purpofe to cheat the\n-holy father out of a little money.\n\u2022 This much is however certain, that be was\nfrequently feized and imprifoned: but it fo\nhappened that he always regained his liberty ip\n-a Ihort time, either from the want of neceifory\nproofs for his convi&ion, on account of.thp\n\u00a1nature of the crime, or by means o f the credit\nand intercefikm of his relations. A t length he\nwras forced to.fly from his country for haying\nduped a goldfmith, of the name of Marano, o f\nmore than, fixty pieces o f gold. H aving inge\u00ad\nnuity fufEcienc to make this iimpleton believe\nthat he had an immenfe treafure concealed in p\ngrotto, in a diftant part of,the country, of whjcfr\nhe would put him in poffefllon; he, under tb\nt^\nB\npretence, procured the above-mentioned fura,\nwhich, as he pretended, was to be employed in\ncertain magical operations. This comedy how,-\never concluded very little to the advantage o f\npoor Marano, for he was fevercly beaten by\ncertain people who appeared to him in the\nihape of infernal fpirits. T he truth is, that\nthefe inhabitants of Pandemonium were no\nother than the companions of Balfamo, who\nafted in concert with him, and afiumed this\ndifguife at his recommendation.\nB 3 Marano\nD\nig\nitiz\ne\ndb\ny\n\fj\n6 t h e l i f e op\n\u2022 Marano havingdifcovered the trick, was ex-t\ntremely .irritated, as may very readily be be\u00ad\nlieved ; and, not content with laying an informa\u00ad\ntion of the particulars before a magiftrate, he\ndetermined to revenge his wrongs, by affafii-\nnating the author of them. It was this that del*\ntermined Balfamo to fly from his native^coun\u00ad\ntry. - ' \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 .\nA variety of circumftances which occurred\nfrom this period till the time o f his laft imprl-\n\u2022fonment, have given grounds to: believe that\nhe pra&ifed forcery. This fuppofuion is\nfounded on the two following anecdotes. T h e\nfirft is, that, under pretence of preparing a re\u00ad\nmedy for one of his fifters, who v\/zsptjejed, he\nmade a country pried: adminifter a little cotton\nto her, which had been fteeped in the holy oil\nwhich is ufed for extreme umftion.. It is how\u00ad\never well known that he never, had a lifter who\nwas pojfejfed. \u2019The other, which is rather re\u00ad\nmarkable, is as follows : It is pretended that,\nbeing one day in company with feveral of his\nfriends, they teftified a great curiofity to dif-\ncover what a certain lady of their acquaintance\nwas doing at that very moment. Balfamo\noffers to fatisfy their inclinations: he accord\u00ad\ningly forms a fquare on the ground, waves his\nhand over it, and then draws the figyre of the\n\u2022 lady\nD\nig\nitiz\ne\ndb\nyGoogle\n\fCOUNT C A G L I O S T R O . !f\nlady playing at. cards with three of; her ac\u00ad\nquaintance. On this they ihilantly ferid Co her\nhoufe, and find that file was- actually fitting-in\nthe lame attitude, employed in the very occu\u00ad\npation, and. in company with the fame perfons\nwhom he had delineated. By. means of the\ncireumftances which we ihall hereafter relate,\nit will be eafy to determine what degree of*\ncredibility fliould be given to this event,, and\nwhat are the conclufions which ought to be\ndrawn from it.\nBalfamo being obliged to fly from Palermo,\ngave himfelf up to a wandering life^ and ae-\ntually travelled through mod parts o f the\nworld : we are henceforth obliged to give cre\u00ad\ndit to his own afiertions until his arrival in\nRome, becaufe we have no other opportunity\no f tracing his hiftory, or of verifying any of the\nparticulars.\nBy means o f the money which he had pro\u00ad\ncured in the manner already related, he now\nrepaired to Medina. There he got acquainted\nwith a certain perfon of the name of Altotas : .\nit is not known with certainty whether he was a\nSpaniard or a Greek, for he could fpeak both pf\nthefe languages with fiuency.

Bal-\nfamo was well aware of the danger of his fitua-\n' tion; and dreading' left he ihould be arrefted\nfor the money advanced, he procured a pair-\nport under a fictitious name, fled with great\nprecipitation to Brufiels, and after having tra\u00ad\nv e le d Germany and Italy, arrived at his native\ncity of Palermo.\nH e did not however long enjoy his liberty\namong his countrymen. Marano, the jeweller\nwhom he had not only duped but baftinadoed,\nas we have before mentioned, having not yet\nforgot his injuries, immediately applied to the\nmagiftrates, and procured an order for his im-\nprifonment. Soon after this, a profecution\ntook place in confequence of the teftament that\nhad been forged in favour of the Marquis\nM au rigi: the protection of a nobleman, to\nwhom he had procured a powerful recommen\u00ad\ndation while at Naples, prevented him, how\u00ad\never, from being condemned to the galleys j *\nand he was actually fet at liberty, on condition\no f immediately departing from Palermo.\nBeing thus once more obliged to abandon\nthe city which gave him birth, he repaired, in\ncompany with his wife, to M alta; where he\n' D z it\ny\nD\nig\nitiz\ne\ndb\nyv^ooQle\n\f^ 6 - T B E . i m O P\n* '\nis faid to have fupported himfelf for fome\ntime by the fale of his pomade for-improv\u00ad\ning the complexion: but the commodity\nfrom which he drew his mod certain revenue\nappears to have been\u2014^his wife !\nA t the end of three months he left that\nifland alfo.

At this period, in compliance with the\ndefires of Lorenza, he invited his father-in-law,\nand his wife\u2019s brother, to Naples ; the latter of\nwhom he was prevailed upon to take under his\nprotection. This young man was handfome,\nand had an engaging air: Balfamo therefore\nformed the defign of matching him with a lady\npoffeffing fimilar qualities, that he might rear\nher up in the fame manner as he had done\nLorenza, and acquire the fame advantages by\nmeans of her beauty. He was well allured that,\nwith two females fo excellently educated, he could\nnot fail of procuring immenfe fums.\nAccompanied by his wife, and his brother-\nin-law, he left Naples, and fet off for France.\nHaving arrived at Marfeilles, they determined\nto remain in that city for fome time.

He himfelf\nhas avowed, without any referve whatever, that\nhe received abundance of prefents from her?\nfome in money, and others in effedts.\nThis lady, who had been formerly very hancj-\nfome, had a lover during her youth, who ftill\nrefided in her neighbourhood; and, notwith-\nHanding his advanced age, exhibited fymptoms\nof the ftrongeft jealoufy af her partiality for\nBaliamo.

The an-\ncienc lover ftill felt all the ardour of affedtion\n.for his charmer ; but he perceived with horror\nthat age had furrowed his cheek, and en\u00ad\nfeebled his pleafures. Balfamo took advapr\nD\nig\nitiz\ne\ndb\ny\n\fCOUNT C A C t I O S T R O . 3\n*\ntage of this, and promifcd by means of a che\u00ad\nmical operation to reftore him to the full vi\u00ad\ngour of youth and enjoyment j and as this de*\ncrepit gallant was feized with the mania of dif-\ncoyering the philofopher\u2019s ftone, the pretended\nphilofopher had the moft ample opportunity of\ndeceiving himat his own eafe. He accordingly\nmade him acquainted with feveral operations\nwhich he performed by means of his alembic,\nand amufed him with the promife of dilcover-\ning the fecrct of making gold. In the mean\ntime, he extracted confiderable fums from him\nunder pretence of purchafing the ingredients,\nwhich he pretended to be exceedingly expen-\nfive. .\nWhile every thing went on in this profper-\nous manner, Balfamo did not lofe fight of the\nproje& which he had formed in behalf of his\nbrother-in-law. He had introduced him as a\nRoman cavalier, pofielfing a large fortune; and\nthe better to fupport this importance, he had\nclothed him in the moft fumptuous and extra\u00ad\nvagant apparel. In the mean time, he himfelf\npafted for an officer of rank; and always af-\nfefted to appear drefled in the PruQtan uni-\n'fbrm, which Agliata had qualified him to wear.\nAll this deception was intended to bring\nD 4 about\nD\nig\nitiz\ne\ndb\nyGoogle\n\f4 9 T H E L I F E O F\n.about a match between the Roman cavalier\nand one of the daughters of his female friend,\nwho was about eighteen-years of age.

It would.be here unncceflary ta\nmention the brutality and cruel ..treatment\nwl\\ich both of them affirm to have experienced\n' from Balfamo on account of this rcfufal; the\ntruth of their declaration is fufficiently gua\u00ad\nrantied by the tranfports of rage natural to a\nman of his charadter, onfeeinghimfelf deprived\nof fuch a fine opportunity of acquiring wealth.\nThe time for accomplilhing the wiihesof the\nold beau 'N ii now nearly elapfed, .and it became\nnecefiary to come to fome refolution howto a\u00a3t\nupon the occafion. This was not difficult:\nBalfamo perfuaded him that he had juft re\u00ad\nceived intelligence that his father-in-law was\nfuddenly feized with a dangerous malady at\nRome, and that it was abfolutely necefiary that\nhe ihould immediately, repair to that capital.\nThis excufe alfo ferved forthe enamoured lady\nana that he might proceed vyith greater dili\u00ad\n. genes\nD\nig\nitiz\ne\ndb\nyGoogle\n\fC O U N T C A G L I O S T R O . 4 *\ngence on his journey, and return with more\ncelerity, they presented him with, an excellent\n.travelling carriage, and a large fum of money.\nHaving converted the carriage into dollars\nat Barcelona, Balfamo, with his wife and her\nbrother, paired through Valencia, and arrived\nat Alicant.

We cannot affirm\nthat they a\u00a3ted in concert on this memorable\noccafion; we can however with fafety aflert,\nthat Caglioftro was well acquainted with the de-\nfigns of this woman, fo wonderfully formed for\nintrigue, and that he always kept his eye ftea-\ndily fixed upon the famous necklace. He cer\u00ad\ntainly perceived, and has indeed confefled in\nhis interrogatories, that he was acquainted with\nwas born at Fontette, on the aid of July 1756 ; and, when\nmarriageable, was united to Comte de la Motte* Having\nfound means, on account of her lirtb , to be admitted to fom\u00a9\ndegree of intimacy with the Queen of France, fhe is ac-\ncufed of having proje&ed the plan of procuring the famous\ndiamond necklace by means of the agency of the Cardi\u00ad\nnal de Rohan\u2022 On the difeovery of that myfterious tranf-\na&ion fhe was arrefted; and committed, on the 29th of May\n1786, to the Baftille.

The officers\nof the police were perfuaded, that without his\naid this piece of roguery and deception could\nnever have been carried on ; and he was ar-\nrefted, and imprifoned in the Baftile. He, how\u00ad\never, did not lofe courage : he even found\nmeans to corrupt his guards, and to,eftablifh a\ncorrefpondence with the other prifoners who\nwereconfined along with him. It was owing to\nthis that they were enabled to be uniform in\nthe anfwers which they gave in to the various\ninterrogatories to which they were obliged to\nreply.\nCaglioftro, who has recounted the whole of\nthe circumftances to us, has added, of his own\naccord, that he denied every thing to hisjudges\nwiththe utmoft intrepidity ; and exhibited fuch\n, 9Jamenefs in his replies, that, on Madame de la\nMotte\u2019s being confronted with him, and find\u00ad\ning herfelf unable to quafh his evidence, ihe\nbecame\nD\nig\nitiz\ne\ndb\nyGoogle\n\fCOUNT C A G L I O S T R O . 6$\n\\\nbecame fo furious, that (he threw a candleftick\nat his head in\n' the prefeuce; of all hisjudges*\nBy this means he was declared innocent...\nOur readers,perhaps will not,be difpleafed at\nthe narrative of his life, which he delivered to\nthe judges while imprifoned in the Baftile;\nwe (hall here recapitulate the particulars.

In the book already quoted,\nit is aflerted that their meetings are intended\nto reftore the glory of architecture, and the\nmechanical art of mafonry. On this account\nthey date their hiftory from Adam, whomGod,\nthe grand architect of the univerfe,,,created after\nhis own image. Mofes and Solomon were, ac\u00ad\ncording to them, grand matters of the order$\nand the hiftory of their art is carried down in\nthis manner from age to age, and from nation\nto nation, particularizing all thofe great princes\nwho have loved arid patronifed architecture.\nIn other works publiihed in defence of this\nfeCt, their origin is adduced from a remnant\nof the Templars who took refuge in Scotland ;\nand who, being often obliged to mingleamong\nthe infidels during the crufades, found it con\u00ad\nG 4 vcnient\nD\nig\nitize\ndb\nyGoogle\n\fSB T H S L I F f e O F\nI\nvenient to recognize each other by means of\ncertain Ggns.

Every clafs has *\nits own particular Ggns and tokens, and every\nlodge its own particular diftinguilhing charac\u00ad\ntersfries. Their ceremonies abound with many,\nridiculous and even fuperftitious rites; but\nwhat is chiefly to be blamed is, thp abufe which\nthey make of every thing facred.

Many perlbns who\nhave carefully examinedandfcrutlnized the lives\nof the free mafons, declare that they have found\njihem all, and particularly their leaders, to be\nmen of bad charader, ignorant, and equally\ndeftitute of morality and religion.

His\nfirft defign was attended with little or no fuc-\ncefsj and he was difliiaded from his fecond, be-\ncaufe he was given tounderffand that at Rome\ncither the ladies have very little money, or\nthey are exceedingly unwilling to part from it.\nThere was one perfon, however, who feemed\nexceedingly defirous to become one of his dif-\nciples j and Caglioftro was uncommonly eager\nto enrol him in the lift, on account of a ring,\nthe brilliancy of which fafcinated his eyes, and\nmade him ogle it with uncommon defire. Not-\nwithftanding his wonderful knowledge of na\u00ad\nture, he never difcovered that the ftones were\ncryftal in(lead of diamonds.\nHaving introduced this fuppofed dupe into\nhis bed-chamber, he informed him that the\nknowledge which he had acquired in Egypt*\nenabled him to eftabliih a fyftem of mafonry,\nto which no perfon could be admitted without\na long and rigorous initiation ; but that he,\nas fupremc grand matter, could difpenfe with\nthe ufual forms.

Thus Caglioltro, whohad\ngained immenfe fums by his rogueries inevery\nother part of Europe, was not able at Rome to\nprocure even a ring fet with falfe ftones, by\nmeans of all his art and abilities!\nSoon after this he began to experience the\nmolt alarming inquietude arifing fromhis dread\nof being betrayed. He acknowledges that hfe\nnow determined to throw himfelf at the feet of\na prieft, and acknowledge his faults. Accord\u00ad\ningly he confeiTed his crimes in this capital, in\nthe fame manner as he had formerly done at\nTrent; and actually declared to two perfons\nwho enjoyed his confidence, that it was on\npurpofe to ridicule the holy lnquifition that\nhe had fubmitted to that ceremony.

It now re\u00ad\nmains to elucidate the particulars which we\nhave related, by clearing up the difficulties and\nobfcurities which his hiftory will undoubtedly\nprefent to the mind of every reader.\nSome will aik how it comes about that fuch\nan artful impoftor as Caglioftro, who, during\nhis trial at Paris, had remained obftinately bent\non deception, could be prevailed upon to be\u00ad\ntray himfelf at Rome ? And how a wretch\nwho had been fo fuccefsful by means of his im-\npoftures in every city in Europe, ihould at length\nbe induced to make a full and free confeffion\nof them ? The recolle&ion of a fimple fa\u00a3t\nwill eafily reconcile thefe circumftances. Not-\nK ' withftanding\nD\nig\nitiz\ne\ndb\ny\n\fJJO T H E L I F E OF\nwithftanding the repeated intelligence that he\nreceived of his approaching confinement, he\nnegle&ed to deftroy the book which contained\nhis fyftem of Egyptian mafonry, the various\nornaments and apparatus belonging to that rite,\nand all the correfpondence which he carried\non with the feveral lodges, of which he was\neither the founder or an affociate. A t the mo\u00ad\nment of his arreft, he beheld every paper that\ncould inform or enlighten his judges in regard\nto his former life, fealed before his eyes : it was\ntherefore impoffible, or at leaft ufelefs, to deny,\nor even tp palliate, thefe circumftances; fince an\nirrefragable body of evidence was thus obtained,\nand full and fufficient proofs could be adduced\nin a moment to fubftantiate the crimes of which\nhe was accufed.\n' It ought alfo to be added, that, from the ex-\nceflive garrulity of Caglioftro, many things oc\u00ad\ncurred in the courfe of his trial, that cleared\nup and elucidated feveral cxprefEons in his\ntnanufcripts, which, without this help, would\nhave remained fo many enigmas. On thefe\noccafions he often attempted to tergiverfate\nand to rccal his expreflions ; but this was impof-\nfible : for his judges had taken the precaution,\nto make him fign his interrogatories page by\npage; and alfo to declare, at the bottom o f\n. each,\n\fV\nC O U N T C A G L I O S T R O . I 3 I -\neach, that the declarations therein contained\nwere entirely conformable to the particulars of\nhis confelfion. Another cifcumftance which\ndid not a little contribute to the happy con-\nclufion of his procefs, was the precaution with\nwhich he was ihut up in the place of his con\u00ad\nfinement. A t the Baftille, as he himfelf \u2018\nfrankly acknowledged, he had found the moil\nample means of prevarication, of eluding the\ncharges adduced againft him, and of corrupting\nhis guards, and even the minifters of juftice,\nby means of money. But, during his impri-\nfonment here, he has found all his arts and all\nhis refources fail him for the firil time. Indeed,\non his being arrefted, it was induftrioufly pro\u00ad\npagated in this capital, that the per&n to whofe\ncare he had been entrufted was his friend and\nprote&or: but 'this was difeovered to be a\nmere calumny; as the judge who firft examin\u00ad\ned him tried by every means in his power to\ndifeover whether any fecret communication had\ntaken place ; and, after a long and laborious '\nenquiry, he brought in a report, by which it\nevidently appeared that this accufation was no\u00ad\nthing lpore than a-groundlefs and a malicious\nftory.\nBut it may itill be demanded how it came\nabout that he acknowledged fo many particu-\n\u2022 K 2 lars\nD\nig\nitiz\ne\ndb\nyGoogle\n\f*\n3\n* T H E L I F E OF\nlars relative to his Egyptian mafonry ?

The evidence be\u00ad\nfore us proves that the number of his followers\nwas confiderable j but they fell far ihort of\nwhat he pretended : and it is no lefs certain that\nthey are daily diminifhing, as they at length\nbegin to perceive and acknowledge the im-\npofture and deception of their grand mafter. It\nhowever is well known that the defertion of his\nfollowers never gave him any concern, as it was\ntheir money rather than their attachment that\nhe was ambitious of.\nIt would be difficult to comprehend the\nuncommon fuccefs which he experienced, if\nit were not recollected that he procured the\ngreater part of his profelytes in countries where\neither the remiflhefs of the government, or the\nnatural depravation of the human heart, had\nenfeebled the foundations pf the catholic faith.\nIt is alfo to be confidered, that he was not fo\nlittle verfed in intrigue as to negledt the moft\nartful means for the fuccefs of his million.\nThus he was moft anxious to choofe the ig\u00ad\nnorant and the rich for his difciples ; and was\nparticularly careful to debauch and corrupt the\nheart, by feconding and affifting the ruling paf-\nK 3 \u201e fxons\nD\nig\nitiz\ne\ndb\ny\n\f1 3 4 T H E L I F E O F\nfions of his converts.

If any one,\ndeterred by the influence of his paflions, can\u00ad\ndidly confefied his attachment to the fair fex,\nhe conftantly replied, that, to become a good\nIpafon, or, what was the fame thing, to become\na perfeSI man, it was not neceflary to be a\ncapuchin. \u201c Live as you pleafe,\u201d he ufed\nto exclaim; \u201c and only believe in me, and in\nmy Egyptian mafonry !\u201d By thefe means, and\nwith fuch maxims, his fuccefs could not fail\nbeing equally rapid and extenflve.\nIt may be alfo neceflary to obferve, that one of\nthe indifpenfable conditions annexed to the ad-\nmiifion into the Egyptian fyftem, was that of\nhaving been already eledted into one of the\nlodges of ordinary mafonry. The motive of\nthis is not difficult to be difeovered; for as his\ninftitution was entirely new, and the principal\nand moft wonderful circumftance attendant on\nit was the phyflcal and moral regeneration, it\nwas more eafy to inveigle the free mafons, whofe\nminds were already debauched, than any other\nclafs of men whatever j and he indeed found\nthat it was not difficult to make thefe be\u00ad\nlieve\nD\nig\nitiz\ne\ndb\nyGoogle\n\fCOO NT C a g l i o s t r o . 1 3$\n\u00fceve in thole marvellous tales and prodigious\nevents that exceeded poffibility, and gave th\u00e9\nlye to the operations of nature.\nThe reader will undoubtedly recoiled that\nCaglioftro pretended to have harangued his au\u00ad\ndience for feveral hours, with an eloquence that\nat once charmed and convinced them ; and with\na fublimity that evinced a prodigious attainment\nin regard to all kinds of knowledge either fa-\ncred or profane.

They fent weekly to the\nmother lodge not only an exaft and authentic\nlift: of the members, affociates, ranks, and\nOfficial diftin&ions, .but alfo of the bulinefs\nconcluded and agreed upon in the courfe of\nevery feffion. They had a deputy, who redded-\nat Paris as the reprefentative of the lodge; and\nby means of him they carried on an uninter\u00ad\nrupted correfpondence with the lodge or Orient\nthere.
