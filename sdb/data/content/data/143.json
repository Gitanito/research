He practises meditation and other spiritual techniques, convinced that science and spirituality are not inimical and that consciousness can be understood in both ways.

His father was a coffee farmer, his mother a surgeon.1 He studied natural science at Trinity College, Cambridge and took his clinical training at St Thomas\u2019s Hospital, London.2 Aged 21, he became interested in consciousness and metaphysics after reading works by Aldous Huxley and Colin Wilson,3 and he became determined in his career to bridge the gap between conventional neuroscience and the parapsychological\/spiritual realm.4\n\nFenwick held a research position as senior lecturer at the Institute of Psychiatry in London and was also a consultant neurophysiologist at St. Thomas\u2019s and Westminster Hospitals in London.&nbsp;From 2000 to 2010 he worked as a visiting professor at the Magnetoencephalography Science Programme&nbsp;at RIKEN Neuroscience Institute in Tokyo. Here he studied the promising neuroimaging technique of magnetoencephalography (MEG), which very finely measures the brain\u2019s magnetic field in real time, monitoring its action millisecond to millisecond without distortion from the skull and thus providing the most comprehensive neuroimaging currently available.5\n\nFenwick is now an emeritus consultant neuropychiatrist at Kings\u2019 College, London, and the Maudsley Hospital (held to be the foremost psychiatric teaching hospital in the United Kingdom), the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, and Broadmoor Hospital in Crowthorne, Berkshire, UK, a high-security psychiatric institution for violent offenders.\n\nFenwick has a longstanding interest in the mind\/brain interface, the problem of consciousness and near-death experiences, a topic on which he is held to be Britain\u2019s leading authority. He has appeared as an expert witness in high-profile legal cases relating to automatism and sleep.\n\nHe has published more than 300 research papers on the subjects of epilepsy, consciousness, sleep, near-death experiences (NDEs), end-of-life experiences, legal questions on the time of death and other death-related phenomena relating to death, collaborating with his wife Elizabeth Fenwick on four books on parapsychological topics (see \u2018Works\u2019 below). He has contributed to numerous radio, television and YouTube programmes on these topics (see \u2018Video\u2019 below), and served on editorial boards of several academic journals including the parapsychological Journal of Scientific Exploration.\n\nFenwick has pursued spiritual development alongside his scientific work. He began meditating daily in 1965 and claims to have done so ever since.6 In his 2019 autobiography Shining Light on Transcendence he describes in detail the work of the French philosopher\/healer Alain Forget and his use of electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional magnetic resonancy imaging (fMRI) to map Forget\u2019s brain activity while carrying out healing.7  Parapsychological Research\n\nFenwick has researched a wide variety of parapsychological and paranormal phenomena, including the physiology of mystical experiences, mystical and spiritual experiences in epileptics, healing effects on water, and most recently, terminal lucidity in children. In particular he has focused on key topics related to consciousness, the brain and death.  Near-Death Experiences\n\nFenwick responded sceptically to Raymond Moody\u2019s 1975 work on near-death experiences (NDEs), Life After Life, but became fascinated after hearing a patient he had known for many years report an NDE resembling those described in the book.8 Frustrated by refusals on the part of clerical and medical leaders to let him interview patients who were dying or who had been clinically dead, he turned to nursing staff and visiting relatives and thus found a wealth of leads.9\n\nThe subsequent NDE investigations resulted in Fenwick collaborating with his wife Elizabeth on their 1995 book The Truth in the Light: An Investigation of Over 300 Near-Death Experiences. The Fenwicks analyzed 350 responses they received to a questionnaire filled out by people in the UK who had seen them on television programmes. They quoted some accounts at length and confirmed known common aspects of NDEs such as feelings of serenity and vitality, immersion in very bright light, view of the body from above, life review, and loss of all fear of death. They also drew on Fenwick\u2019s neuroscience expertise to assess alternative explanations.10\n\nFenwick participated in the mass study of NDEs entitled AWARE (AWAreness during REscusitation) conducted in fifteen hospitals in the UK, USA and Austria.  End-of-life Experiences\n\nPeter and Elizabeth Fenwick\u2019s 2008 book The Art of Dying resulted from extensive investigations of people approaching the ends of their lives. Detailed accounts of experiences are quoted, revealing common themes such as deathbed visions of deceased loved ones, crisis impressions and visions of light. While grounded in science, the book takes an instructional and practical approach, exploring the dying-related practices of different cultures and offering recommendations to minimize suffering during the dying process. The Fenwicks produced several brochures for the public and for health professionals designed to help make death as painless and non-frightening as possible (for example, see \u2018Guide\u2019 below).  Dreams\n\nThe parapsychological sections of the Fenwicks\u2019 1999 book on dreams, The Hidden Door, cover two main types of ESP phenomena in dreams, namely telepathy and precognition, both of which are commonly known about anecdotally, the latter even in ancient times. They point out that both Freud and Jung acknowledged the occurrence of telepathy in dreaming, and cite reports of shared dreams between emotionally-close people and the Maimonides dream telepathy research of the 1960s and 1970s. The Fenwicks point out that precognitive dreams more often presage disasters and death, for instance the Teton Dam collapse in the US, and the Aberfan coal-spoil disaster in Wales, rather than ordinary life events.  Reincarnation\n\nIn their book Past Lives (2001), the Fenwicks quote cases sent by readers in response to a newspaper article in a fairly comprehensive discussion of reincarnation issues. They acknowledge the scientific approach adopted by the reincarnation research pioneer Ian Stevenson and others, though they prefer purely psychological explanations for some of Stevenson\u2019s investigated cases.  Consciousness\n\nFenwick was perhaps the first scientist to monitor the brain activity of people while meditating, one of whom was the rock musician George Harrison, observing patterns that correlated with their reported experiences. He also tested meditators for an ability to require less oxygen, with less success.11\n\nFenwick personally explored consciousness relating to Zen meditation by practising it in Japan during his times at the RIKEN Neuroscience Institute. His meditational experience and personal work with Alain Forget inspired an interest in the sudden expansion of consciousness he terms \u2018awakening\u2019, also \u2018enlightenment\u2019 and \u2018breakthrough\u2019. He considers awakening to be a natural stage of human evolution, following the early Canadian psychiatrist and coiner of the term \u2018cosmic consciousness\u2019 Richard Maurice Bucke (1837\u20131902), as well as Alain Forget and other sources. It does not necessarily require training but comes to people more often through overwhelming emotional trauma or spiritual experience, he contends. It is characterized by a stable core sense of joy unrelated to circumstances; a focus on the present; a sense of self as universal rather than egotistical; and a view of other people not as their bodies but as flows of energy.12 Fenwick notes that awakening is more common than thought and thus due for scientific examination. He writes, \u2018We are on the cusp of a scientific revolution in our understanding of the nature of expanded consciousness.\u201913  Affiliations and Mentoring\n\nFenwick is a Fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and a former President of the British branch of the International Association for Near Death Studies. He has headed up the Scientific and Medical Network, a group of doctors and scientists dedicated to fostering intuitive as well as rational mental processes to the benefit of science and medicine,14 and the Horizon Research Foundation, devoted to funding end-of-life research.15 Leading NDE researchers whose work he has advised on include Sam Parnia, Margot Grey, Penny Sartori, Ornella Corazza, Sue Brayne, and Hilary Lovelace.16  Works  Select Books\n\nThe Truth in the Light: An Investigation of Over 300 Near-Death Experiences (1995, with Elizabeth Fenwick).
