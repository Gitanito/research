V. C. Herbert\nThe Society held a series of nine sittings with Miss Frances Camp-\nbell during the early part of 1936. The sitters were the following :\nProfessor Broad, The Hon. Mrs Alfred Lyttelton, Mr Kenneth\nRichmond, Mrs Kenneth Richmond, Mrs Salter, Admiral Strutt,\nMiss Nea Walker, \" Miss Milton \", and \" Dr Davison \". The two\nlast are pseudonyms, the real names of the sitters being, of course,\nknown to the Society. Dr Davison is the same as the person desig-\nnated by that name in the records of the Compton Case [Walker :\nThrough a Stranger's Hands, p. 272, 1935]. So far as is known, none\nof the sitters was previously known to Miss Campbell, who was not,\nof course, given their names ;\nthough the possibility of her having\nrecognized them must not be excluded in considering the results.\nExcept in the case of Miss Milton's sitting, a stenographic record\nwas taken by Miss Horsell.\nProfessor Broad's sitting provides little of any evidential value.\nA great many mistakes were made in the process of constructing\n\" communicator personahties \", but one section of the record is\nworth noting as possibly showing paranormality :\nMiss Campbell : Have you got two watches on you at the\nmoment ?\nDr Broad : Not actually on me, but I keep two watches going\nand I have usually got one or the other on.\nMiss Campbell : Because your father laughs about your ringing\nthe changes on the watches.\nDr Broad : That is quite true.\nMiss Campbell : And one is a much better production than the\nother.\nMiss Campbell : . . . And referring to one watch he says that\nit was lost for some time and then was found, and would you enquire\nif ever that watch was lost or put on one side and then resurrected.\nDr Broad : Could he say which of the two watches he is referring\nto ?\nMiss Campbell : He is referring to the one not so valuable, that\none.\nNotes by Professor Broad :\nI have a good gold watch and chain, which my father would know\nvery well : and also a very old silver watch with no chain, which\n\fjANtJAEY 1937 Report on Sitttings 3\nis very dark and dirty on the outside. Within the last ten years I\nhave taken to carrying the old watch in the back pocket of my\ntrousers when I am wearing a pullover instead of a waistcoat. I\nput on the gold one iu the evenings when I change into a suit.\nThe old silver watch came from the exhibition of 1862. I \" resur-\nrected \" it when I took to wearing a pullover by day.\nAnother section of interest is as follows :\nMiss Campbell : ... You do not hve with your mother,\nbecause your father [\"' communicator \"] tells me that you do not\nlive with her, and I must not confuse the two houses.\nDr Broad : That is quite correct.\nMiss Campbell : You are not to forget her birthday, so that it is\nquite close. [Momentary pause] Not quite close, he tells me. Is it\ntrue that you do not always remember ?\nDr Broad : I was going to say that is very good. It is the sort\nof thing I do forget, and it is taken very badly if I do forget. That\nis quite a good remark. I know the day but I do not always re-\nmember on the day.\nNote by Professor Broad :\nBirthday is on May 22.\nThis passage is not so good as the one referring to the watch, since\na great number of peoj^le forget birthdays\u2014even of their nearest\nrelations : and neither passage can be called really evidential of\na paranormal faculty.\nTwo other points from the sitting are worth mentioning. Miss\nCampbell said, Were you very nearly called JOHN ?\n\" Professor\nBroad's note to this is, \" My father always caUed me John, though\nit is not my name. Other members of the family seldom or never\ncalled me by that name.\" Later she said, \" Your father is saying\nabout 10 o'clock you have some kind of hot drink, not tea, and this\nman [his mother's servant] gets it for you.\" Professor Broad notes.\nEvery night at about 9 o'clock, when I am at home, he brings me a\ntumbler of hot water.\"\nMrs Lyttelton's sitting was, if anything, poorer than Professor\nBroad's. A number of christian names were given, nearly all of\nwhich were wrong (see appendix). Mrs Lyttelton adds the following\nnote to the record :\n\" There are gleams of knowledge and imder-\nstanding here and there\u2014but it is a confused sitting, and there is\nnothing which could not have been gathered out of my mind.\"\nMr Richmond's sitting was better than either of these. A pseudo-\nfather personahty was developed by Miss Campbell (Mr Richmond's\nfather is still hving) which Mr Richmond thinks may possibly be an\nattempted Myers communication. Mr Richmond did not connect\n\f4 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Januaby 1937\nthis figure with Myers at the time ; but the idea occurred to him\nlater, on reading the record. Mr Richmond notes \" How far my\nsubsequent conjectures, as I annotated the record, may be constructs\nof my own, and how far they may be possible inferences from the\nrecord itself, is a matter of sitter-psychology.\" My own view from\na study of the records and Mr Richmond's annotations is that the\nlatter alternative is the more probable. Miss Campbell's remarks\ndo not impress me as having any connection with Myers. Points of\ninterest in the sitting are as follows :\nMiss Campbell mentioned an interest in \" colour from electricity \",\nwhich is correct in that Mr Richmond has worked at the carbon arc\nspectrum as influenced by the use of different cores. \" Colour from\nelectricity \" is such a curious phrase that the connection is striking.\nMiss Campbell said :\n\"... and do you go to a big building where\nthere is a great deal of thought and discussion and books ? I think\nthe membership) must be confined almost to men.\" Mr Richmond's\nnote runs :\n\" Possibly the Adlerian Society meetings in Medical\nSociety's rooms. If so books are visibly in the picture and men are\nin a large majority. Membership is confined to doctors, but laymen\ngo as guests.\" Miss Campbell gives John as the name of Mr Rich-\nmond's father. It is actually the second of his two christian names.\nLater she says that in connection with the father \" they \" write up\n87 years. The correct age is 86. She also suggests that Mr Rich-\nmond has three children of which one is a girl and the youngest a\nboy. This is correct.\nMrs Richmond's sitting was by far the most successful of the series\nas regards names, seven were given, all of which were significant.\nSeveral \" communicators \" were produced, the most striking being\none in connection with whom a gold cross was mentioned. This was\nvery significant for a friend, who died in 1926, to whom Mrs Rich-\nmond had given a gold and topaz cross during her last illness. Much\nof the sitting is of interest and certainly seems to contain evidence of\nparanormal knowledge. Unfortunately, the relevant passages are\ntoo long to be usefully quoted here.\nWith Mrs Salter, Miss Campbell was unsuccessful in producing\n\" communicators \" ; but there were a few passages referring to the\nsitter which may be evidential\n:\nMiss Campbell : ... And whether he is suggesting it or it is\na fact, at the moment I can't say, but he is showing me a request for\nyou to go abroad, or of some condition to go across water, and there\nis another person there.\nNote by Mrs Salter :\nThis suggested to me my aunt, Flora Merrifield, who is wintering\n\fJanuaey 1937 Report on Sittings 5\nat Cannes. At the time of the sitting I had no intention of visiting\nher, but at the beginning of March she wrote suggesting I should go\nover at Easter and it now (March 7) seems hkely I may go.\nMiss Campbell : There is a man speaks French to you. Do you\nspeak French fluently ?\nMrs Salter : Yes, I speak French pretty well.\nMiss Campbell : . . . Can you gather why they speak of some\nold condition with France that might have been unhappy ?\nNote by Mrs Salter :\nThe allusion to French is appropriate. I have French ancestors\nand as a child spoke French almost as well as Enghsh. My French\nancestors were royahsts and suffered heavily during the Kevolution.\nMiss Campbell : And February is an anniversary in your family.\nMrs Salter : There is an anniversary in February.\nMiss Campbell : And there is a birthday in March.\nMrs Salter : Yes, I know a birthday in March.\nNote by Mrs Salter :\nMy father's birthday was in February. My husband's birthday\nis in March.\nThe sitting contains so many mistakes that perhaps these successes\nmay be nothing more than lucky shots ; but the first is certainly\nstriking, and the other two by no means bad.\nAdmiral Strutt's sitting began in a very curious way, as follows :\n[The medium held the sitter's hands for a minute.]\nMiss Campbell : Thank you. Now I think you are going to have\nno sitting unless something very powerful develops here.\nAdmiral Strutt : No sitting ?\nMiss Campbell : You bring very negative conditions with you,\nand not negative so far as data or communications are concerned\nbut some barrier around you.\nMiss Campbell then began a \" communicator \" Une, suggesting a\nlady closely connected with the sitter. Although Admiral Strutt did\nnot reject this, it was not developed ; and Miss Campbell began a long\n\" character reading \"\n\u2014some of which, according to Admiral Strutt's\nannotations, was strikingly correct. There are some 20 pages of\ntypewritten record, of which the last 5 are poor. Admiral Strutt\nnotes on page 15 :\n\" From here onwards there is nothing particularly\ncorrect or of interest to me. I thought at the time the medium had\nlost grip or interest.\"\nThe sitting is interesting as being so different in technique from the\nothers of the series ; but there is Uttle in it that can be called\nevidential.\n\f6 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Janxiaey 1937\nWith Miss Nea Walker, IVIiss Campbell was in much better form\nthan with the Admiral. Though she started badly\u2014making some\nserious mistakes with the usual \" parent communicators \", Miss\nCampbell almost immediately used the expression your group (\" and\nyour mother joins your group . . .\"). The word is used twice more\nin the sitting :\n\" She would like you to know she is happy and\nsafely arrived in the group \", and \" There is a group of people ; she\nexpects them to come forward \". Readers of Miss Walker's books\nwill remember that she uses the word group to denote a supposed\nassociation of communicators. I do not think the word occurs in\nany of the other sittings of the series ;\nso, if Miss Campbell did not\nrecognise Miss Walker, it is curious that it should be appUed three\ntimes to her.\nVarious \" commiuiicators \" are developed with considerable\nsuccess.\nMiss Campbell : ... do you have an aunt called Mary ?\nMiss Walker : I have not an aunt, but I know the name Mary.\nMiss Campbell : A lady here who writes up the name Mary,\nbut her attitude is that of a relative ; knows you extremely well and\nvery fond of you.\nMiss Walker : I know a Mary like that.\nMiss Walker annotates as follows : Here begin remarks appro-\npriate as from Mrs White of\n'\n' The Bridge \" . We called her\n'\n' Mary \",\nher 2nd name.\nThe Mary line is developed further, and then \" Mary \" introduces\nanother \" communicator \", recently passed over :\nMiss Campbell : ... Do you know a lady who has passed over\nrecently ; she would hke you to know she is happy and safely\narrived in the group.\nMiss Walker : Do you mean Mary would hke me to ? What\nsort of lady ?\nMiss Campbell : She is not a relative of Mary's, but she is attached\nto you very closely. I think from what Mary said she lived in your\nhouse. Can you follow that ?\nMiss Walker : Yes.\nMiss Campbell : And the capacity was in some way dependent.\nMiss Walker : Yes.\nThis, Miss Walker says, apphes to an old family servant, who\ndied in 1935, October. There are many other references to this\n\" communicator \", some of which are highly characteristic.\nIn connection with the same \" communicator \" the name John\nis given, as of a person still living. There is in fact a step-brother\nof the old servant who is living and is called John.\n\fJanuary 1937 Report on Sittings 7\nIn connection with Miss Walker herself, Miss Campbell says,\n\" And you bring with you the ability for other people to com-\nmunicate \". As Miss Walker has specialised in Proxy Sittings,\nthis is, of coiirse, extremely apt, and again raises the question of the\neffectiveness of her incognito.\nThe sitting, which ends with an accurate \" character reading \",\ncontains a good deal of material which seems to be evidential of a\nparanormal faculty.\nWe now come to Miss Milton's sitting\u2014by far the most remark-\nable of the series. Miss Campbell began in a conventional manner,\nand soon suggested a \" communicator \", who was not, however,\nfurther developed at this stage of the sitting. It was correctly\nstated that the sitter's father was no longer alive, and a suggestion\nwas made that her mother was still Uving.\nThe part of the record dealing with this is worth quoting, as\nshowing Miss Campbell's obvious dependence on her sitter's answers.\nMiss Campbell : . . . And is it true that your mother is living ?\nMiss Milton : Do you want me to answer ?\nMiss Campbell : It perhaps isn't right for you to answer. I\ndon't know, your father points to this side and says \" Mother \", and\nthen points back to spirit, and I am puzzled. No, your mother\nisn't Uving on this earth plane, but there is something still left. I\nam completely puzzled.\nHere Miss Campbell was right the first time, the sitter's mother\nwas still alive ; but when the sitter said, \" Do you want me to\nanswer ?\n\" in reply to the question \" Is it true that your mother is\nliving ? \", it would obviously suggest to Miss Campbell that the\nmother was dead. Miss Campbell then said positively that the\nmother was dead, but quahfied the statement by adding, \" there is\nsomething still left\u2014I am completely puzzled \".\nIt looks from this as though Miss Campbell were framing her\nstatements on two main sources of information : one, a spontaneous\nflash of intuition\u2014what people call a \" hunch \" ; the other, rational\ndeduction from the sitter's reactions. In this case the \" hunch\n\"\nwas right and the deduction wrong. Miss Campbell allowed herself\nto be guided by her reason\u2014though she was obviously not happy\nabout it, and was thus led into error. If this is so, it shows that the\n\" medium \" can sometimes be hindered instead of helped by the\nsitter's answers.\nThe sitting now took a very curious turn. Miss Campbell turned\nto Miss Horsell, the note-taker, and said :\n\" You know, for the first\ntime, I find it diSicult to give the sitting with writing. You have\nbeen terribly good\u2014you have never crossed the vibration before.\n\f8 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1937\nAnd it isn't you so much, as it's the spirit people\u2014they are making\na ring round you and they want that pad put down and the pencil,\nand they want just to talk to you [i.e. to Miss Milton]. I tell them\nmentally they are not good for the purpose of investigation, but\nthey can't put up with that. ... I am sorry I can only give you\nthis sitting alone.\" Miss Horsell then had no alternative but to go.\nWith many sitters this would have been disastrous for our pur-\nposes ;\nbut, very fortimately, Miss Milton is herself an expert note-\ntaker, and was able to get down very accurately what Miss Campbell\nsaid.\nMiss Campbell first gave some accurate details of the sitter's\nfamily hfe, and then developed the \" communicator \" produced at\nthe beginning of the sitting. In spite of some inconsistencies. Miss\nMilton took this to refer to a man \" who was very fond of me and\nseveral times asked me to marry him. This was about 16 years\nago ; he has never married. We have never quite lost touch and\nmeet occasionally\u2014perhaps twice or three times a year.\" In\nanother note. Miss Milton says, \" I had been thinking a little of\nhim latterly and had begun to wonder if he could have \" passed\nover \" as I had not heard from him for nearly 10 months and as\n3 months had gone by since I had written to him for news. On\nmy way to the sitting I thought to myself half jokingly, '\nI ought\nto have brought a letter of his and then I might get news of him !\n'\nI was not thinking of him when the sitting started.\"\nMiss Campbell described the death of the \" communicator \" as\nfollows :\nMiss Campbell : He was not in touch with you when he passed\nout. He passed out an exhausted man, not so much an ill man.\nThe end was quick. You were not in contact with him. I think\nthere was some trouble here [showing chest], though it may not\nhave been known. The wish to go on hving had already gone, yet\nhe felt he ought to stay on.\nA lot of things were said by Miss Campbell which seemed to apply\nvery accurately to this man :\n\" Was he at one time interested in writing ?\n\"\n[He was once Dramatic Critic to a paper.]\n\" You have no photograph of him at all.\"\n[This is true.]\n\" On earth ... he was nearly always tired and yet he worked very\nhard at one time.\"\n[The last few years this has been true.]\nThis following is very impressive :\nMiss Campbell : Do you drive a motor ? He smiles about it.\n\fJanuaky 1937 Report on Sittings 9\nHad you ever difficulty in turning round somewliere ? He quarrels\na little with your \" docking \". He uses that expression, \" docking\n\"\nthe car. I think perhaps you are a Uttle careless about this and\njust run the car in at the side of the road. Very frequently he sat\nia that car and chatted with you while you were there.\nMiss Milton notes as follows : Yes, there was a special occasion\non which, when out with him, I found myself in a very narrow lane\n\u2014\na dead end\u2014with no room to turn. We had some amusement over\nthis as it took me some minutes to turn my big and clumsy car.\nWe would sometimes pull up just off the edge of the road and sit\nand talk.\nLately, as he was in poor health, I occasionally took him out for a\ncountry drive.\nThere is also the following, referring to the car :\nMiss Campbell : He is interested in the possibihty of your\nchanging (1) the car. It is an excellent car, he says, except for\nthe outside (2). You do not get much acceleration (3) on it. Is\nthat true ? Then he laughs and says it is marvellous to have it,\nyou must not give it up. He is definitely against the possibility of\nyour giving it up. He says it may take a httle scheming, if you\nmake out it is of such use to others you would get it (4).\nTo which the sitter notes :\n(1) Last September we very nearly decided to change the car.\n(2) Quite true. It is an excellent old Humber with good engine\nbut is shabby.\n(3) True, I have just had to have it decarbonised.\n(4) I and my family often say that for economy we ought to\ngive up the car, but then we think how nice it is for my Mother to\nhave it and how much pleasure we can give to other people and\ndecide we must try to keep it on.\nThere are many other points, given as coming from this \" com-\nmunicator \", which were characteristic of this man, and which\nseemed to show knowledge of Miss Milton's affairs.\nIt wiU be remembered that Miss Milton did not know that this\nman was dead ; but thought he might be, as she had not heard\nfrom him for some time. She says :\n\" The day after the sitting\nI wrote to find out something about him and to my siirprise received\na letter from him. He was very apologetic for not having written\nfor so long. His reason was that he had been very ill and had been\nrun over, which had made letter-writing impossible for a long time.\"\nIt seems probable that if the man really had been dead, this\n\" communication \" would have been claimed by many people as\nbeing highly \" evidential \" of survival.\n\f10 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1937\nAnother section of the record is worth quoting in full as seeming\nto show paranormal knowledge of Miss Milton's affairs :\nMiss Campbell : There is some extraordinary thing about a will\nin connection with your Father. Do you know of some will that\nmust be put into operation now to link up a will of your Father's ?\nIt hnks up this lady also. There is something your Father has\nbeen trying to impress, something that would make an easier\nworking and carrying of it out. You intend to do it but do not\nactually get down to it (1). . . .\nThere is some man you have not seen much of lately, whom you\nhave got out of touch with. He is something to do with carrying\nout the will. This lady would be better advised to eUminate him\nif possible (2).\nHas the lady got quite a lot of heavy furniture ? After she\npasses out they want you to be sensible and have aU the furniture\neliminated. It never will be of any use to people it is left to (3).\nAlthough it is not advisable for the lady to move now, it would\nhave been so some time ago, and forcefulness and a httle hardness\non your part could have brought it through. It would have been\nmuch better to have done it some time ago (4).\nNotes by the sitter :\n(1) AU absolutely true. My Mother is in process of remaking\nher will whereby she can readjust the balance of certain dispositions\nmade in my Father's will, as circumstances of some of her family\nhave changed since then. Therefore her will is to \" link up my\nFather's will \". We are going to a new, young and able solicitor\nfor the first time, who should be able to help us to carry this out.\nThe old sohcitor who carried out my Father's will was past his work\nand made things very difficult and prolonged. All this entails a\nlot of work for me as all our financial affairs have to be gone into\nthoroughly for the new solicitor. I have got partially through it but\nnever seem to have leisure to \" get down to it \" and finish things off.\n(2) True. We have been lately regretting the appointment of\none of my Mother's and Father's Trustees with whom we have lately\ngot out of touch. We have said we wish we could get rid of him\n\u2014\nbut of course we cannot do this.\n(3) Absolutely true. My Mother has a lot of large and very\nvaluable furniture which is to be equally divided between her\nchildren. Much of it may prove difficult to deal with and we have\nlately been discussing the advisability (when the time comes) of\nselhng a great part of it and dividing the proceeds.\n(4) True. We are constantly regretting that we did not move\nout of our present large house when my Father died. We thought\n\fJanitaey 1937 Report on Sittings 11\nat the time it would be rather a wrench for my Mother, who has\nlived there all her married life, and out of consideration for her we\nstayed on. We find the house too large and a constant trouble to\nkeep up. As my Mother is very elderly now it is rather too late to\nthink of facing the move with its upheaval.\n]\\Ir Richmond, who has studied the record of this sitting, refers\nto the \" commmiicator \" as follows : \"I think the man friend in\nthis sitting represents the best\u2014or purest\u2014example I know of\ncoromunicator-impulse referable to the medium's mind alone and\nmaking use of apparently telepathic data from the sitter.\"\nThe remaining sitting to be considered is Dr Davison's. The\nfirst \" communicator \" to be produced was one \" Wilham \", for\nwhom the initial H was also given. Dr Davison cannot place him\nat all. Next comes a curious passage :\nMiss Campbell : . . . And did you at one time have something\nto do with things going away ; there's water, beside the sea, and\nwatching a lot of stuff coming in or watching it going out.\nDr Davison : A lot of stuff by the sea 1\nMiss Campbell : Yes.\nDr Davison : I don't know quite what you mean. A lot of water\ncoming in ?\nMiss Campbell : No, no, material or people going in or out by\nthe sea, many years ago, something you used to do. Lots of little\njourneys on the sea. And you used to inspect or watch something\nover a short period, and there is a sea captain knew you quite\nwell, but again only in passing.\nDr Davison notes :\n\" All this strikes me as suggesting merchant\nservice\u2014short trips and loading and imloading cargo, and in that\nsense does not apply to me. But I was in the Navy for 10 years\nbefore the War, but not in the War.\nLater, iVIiss Campbell said, \" There is something very important\nabout naval conditions. If he [' A man . .\n.' (who) '\n. . . wants to\ntell you many things . . .'] were to talk to you about naval condi-\ntions, would you understand them ?\n\" To which Dr Davison, who-\nis a very cautious sitter, repHed : \"I might.'\"\nAnother \" communicator \" was produced :\nMiss Campbell : ... I think he is a very close relative. His\nunderHp protrudes a httle bit, definitely, and the nose is slightly\nprominent (1) ; and he has a ring that has some significance (2)..\nIt is not in his possession now. Has some words or a crest on it\nthat would be known, and he takes out a watch and that is in\nexistence now, but skips some one\u2014almost like a third generation.\n\u2014skips the second, and the third has got it (3).\n\f12 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1937\nDr Davison : Yes, so the owner of the watch is the first genera-\n\"tion ?\nMiss Campbell : Yes.\nNotes by sitter :\n(1) I cannot place him.\n(2) CUche.\n(3) I have a watch that was presented to my grandfather (in-\nscribed) and came to me\u2014the 3rd generation and skipped the 2nd.\nThe following is curious and interesting :\nMiss Campbell : You are very hke a grandmother ; if you had\na much more prominent nose, you would be very hke the old lady\nwho is here ; the same expression in your eyes as she has. . . .\nTo which Dr Davison notes :\n\" This is true, there is a remarkable resemblance.\"\nNow comes a \" communicator \" of very great interest\n:\nMiss Campbell : ... Can you place a friend who passed out\ntragically ? (1) Unfortunately he is in rather an unhappy condi-\ntion.\nDr Davison : Try and hold on to him.\nMiss Campbell : Each time he has made a desperate effort, and\nknows you have tried to help, since he passed over.\nDr Davison : Can you tell me anything about the tragedy ?\nMiss Campbell : It is something that shocked him in the extreme,\nwhich has injured other people (2). Can you understand that ?\nDr Davison : Yes.\nSitter's notes :\n(1) Cf. the Compton Sitting. \" Through a Stranger's Hands.\"\n(2) Actually Compton's death did not injure anyone.\nAfter this there is a good deal of material about the same \" com-\nmunicator \" which does not apply to Compton. Then comes the\nfollowing :\nMiss Campbell : And although in a sense I think he was well\nknown, yet he didn't make many friends (1). He seemed to regard\nyou as one of his oldest (2) and best friends. You have something\nin your house belonging to him (3), something you had before he\npassed over, many years before.\nDr Davison : Yes.\nMiss Campbell : It was something he had given you.\nDr Davison : Yes, what ?\nMiss Campbell : It stands on something ; it isn't of use. Can\nyou follow that ?\nDr Davison : Yes. ,\n.\nSitter's notes :\n\fJanuary 1937 Report on Sittings 13:\n(1) True.\n(2) Not oldest, for I had not known him more than about 5 or\n6 years.\n(3) The only thing I had that belonged to him was a picture he\ngave me.\nLater Miss Campbell said :\n\" And who is G ? Can you place G,\nbecause he writes up G ?\n\" Dr Davison notes that G is the correct\ninitial.\nIn connection with the same \" communicator \", we get the\nfollowing :\nMiss Campbell : ... Not the honour of position that I have\nhad but the affection and respect in which I was held has helped\nme through this difficult time. Can you understand that ?\nDr Davison : Is that what he says ?\nMiss Campbell : Yes.\nDr Davison notes :\n\" I hke this. It is almost characteristic.\"\nLater\n:\nMiss Campbell : . . . But your friend's death was a violent one^\ncan you place that ? (1)\nDr Davison : Yes.\nMiss Campbell : He has never described it. The guide would\nhelp him if he could.\nDr Davison : Could he tell us what sort of a death it was ?\nMiss Campbell : It wasn't quick, although it was violent. Can\nyou understand him choking in the throat and gasping ? (2)\nDr Davison : Yes.\nSitter's notes :\n(1) Yes.\n(2) He drowned\u2014suicide.\nThere is a lot more about the same \" communicator \", including\nmany inaccuracies and mistakes, and then, right at the end. Miss\nCampbell said :\n\" But as this friend left, he put his hand to his head^\nand said that was the trouble, and he walked away.\"\nTo this, Dr Davison notes :\n\" His head was his great trouble.\"\nWhat are we to conclude from the study of these nine sittings ?\nAre they evidential of survival ? Far from it. The information\nabout Dr Compton might have come from the departed spirit of\nthe suicide, but then it might have come from Dr Davison's mind ;\nwhereas the information about Miss Milton's friend could not\npossibly have come from the departed spirit of the \" communicator\n\"\nbecause, as it turned out in the end, the friend was alive all the\n\f14 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Januaey 1937\ntime, although at the sitting Miss Milton thought he might be dead.\nThe sitting certainly illustrates the great danger of accepting\n\" communications \" as genuine messages from the dead, merely\nbecause the \" medium \" can produce information which it seems\nimpossible that she could normally have known.\nThis brings us to the much more difficult question of the value\nof the sittings as evidence of extra-sensory perception on the part\nof Miss Campbell. Does so-called telepathy between sitter and\n\" medium \" really take place ? Can Miss Campbell read the sitter's\nmind, other than by conscious and unconscious deduction from\nsensory perception of the sitter's appearance and response to\nemotional stimuli ? How far can the results obtained be accounted\nfor by chance coincidence ?\nThese questions are very difficult to answer. It seems to me\nthat all that can be safely said is the following : It certainly looks\nas if Miss Campbell possessed a faculty, varying very greatly in\nintensity as between sitter and sitter, and as between incident and\nincident\u2014a faculty of obtaining information from the unconscious\nmind of the sitter in a manner not normally explainable. Unless\nappearances are deceptive, the existence of this faculty should be\nclearly demonstrable by experiments employing a sufficiently\nsubtle technique. This apparent faculty is so much in evidence in\nthis short series of only nine sittings, that if it is really as extra-\nsensory as it would seem to be, it is curious that no one has ever\nbeen able to demonstrate it beyond reasonable doubt. It may be\nthat confirmation of the important work of Pratt with Mrs Garrett\nmay provide such demonstration. But experience shows that\n-apparently \" cast-iron \" experiments so often prove to be un-\nrepeatable by subsequent investigators that it would be rash to\nmake predictions in this as in any branch of our illusive subject.\nC.

Mrs Alfred Lyttelton, G.B.E., in the Chair. There\nwere also present : Sir Ernest Bennett, M.P., Mr W. H. Salter,\nMr H. F. Saltmarsh, Admiral the Hon. A. C. Strutt and the Rev.\nC. Drayton Thomas ; also Mr C. V. C. Herbert, Research Officer,\nand Miss Isabel Newton, Secretary.\nThe Minutes of the last Meeting of the Council were read and\nsigned as correct.\nTwo new Members were elected. Their names and addresses are\ngiven above.\nThe Report of the Council for 1936 was considered, and adopted\nas amended.\nANNUAL REPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR 1936\n(1) The Council feel that they cannot proceed to give an account\nof the last year's work without referring to the grievous losses\nsustained by the Society during the year through death. The\nSociety has lost in Mrs Sidgwick one who, by her active partici-\npation in the Society's work from the very earliest days, occupied a\nunique position among us, having, in the words of the brief notice\nrecording her death in the Journal for February 1936, \" left an\nenduring mark both on psychical research as a study and on the\nS.P.R. as an organisation for pursuing it.\" Heavy also were the\nlosses sustained by the Society through the death of Mr Everard\nFeilding, who was formerly for many years a member of Council\nand Hon. Secretary of the Society, and continued till his death to\nbe actively interested in its work, and Mr Sydney Scott, a Council\nmember, who very generously on many occasions gave his advice\nand assistance to the Society on legal matters without charge to our\nfunds. Other losses to the Society by death include Miss Mehan\nStawell, an Hon. Associate, Mr E. S. Thomas, Dr Eleanor C. Lodge,\nthe Rev. Dr Percy Dearmer, Miss Ahce Balfour, Prof. J. J. Grundy,\nMr F. D. Perrott and Mr Joseph Whitaker, one ofour oldest members.\n(2) Organisation of Research. The Research Committee, ap-\npointed in 1934, continues to meet regularly, and its membership\nhas recently been increased. It now consists of the following\nmembers : Mr Whately Carington, Mr Eric Cuddon, Mr Oliver\nOatty, Mr C. C. L. Gregory, Mr Gerald Heard, Lord Charles Hope;\nthe Hon. Mrs Alfred Lyttelton, G.B.E., Dr T. W. Mitchell, Mr\nKenneth Richmond, Mrs W. H. Salter and Mr G. N. M. Tyrrell,\nwith Mr Herbert, who has now been appointed Research Officer,\nas Secretary.\n\f20 Journal of Society for Psychical Research February 193T\n(3) PrincijMl Lines of Research. The investigations conducted by-\nMr Tyrrell into extra-sensory perception, by Mr Whately Carington\ninto the quantitative study of trance personalities, and by ]\\Ir\nKenneth Richmond into the psychology of Mrs Leonard's trance\ncommunications have been actively pursued, and papers reporting\nthe progress of these investigations have been presented to the\nSociety. In addition, a series of sittings has been held with Miss\nFrances Campbell, a medium with whom several of our members\nhave already had sittings ; also another series with Mrs Garrett.\n(4) Spontaneous Phenomena. The work of investigating spon-\ntaneous phenomena of all kinds has been continued. It is intended\nto print in the Journal from time to time notes by the Research\nOfficer and other investigators as to the work being carried out by\nthem, and it is hoped that this will enable members to keep in\ncloser touch with the research work of the Society.\n(5) Presidency. The Council were so fortunate as to secure Pro-\nfessor Broad's consent to his re-election to the Presidency for a\nsecond term of office.\n(6) Changes in the Council. To fill vacancies caused by death, the\nCouncil have aj)pointed Admiral Strutt and Lord Charles Hope a&\nelected members of Council.\n(7) New Honorary Associates. Mr Kenneth Richmond and Dr\nW. H. C. Tenhaeff of Utrecht have been elected Hon. Associates.\n(8) Donations to the Society. In May 1936, a member who wished\nto remain anonymous, announced his intention, in lieu of his sub-\nscription, to purchase \u00a3100 2|% Consols in the Society's name, tO'\nbe treated as capital, adding that this precedent might serve tO'\ncrystallize half-formed intentions to leave a small legacy, which\nowing to the trouble of a codicil and the reluctance to alter a Will,,\nmight not eventually materiahze. This generous example has been\nfollowed by the Hon. Treasurer who has invested \u00a3100 for the\nSociety's benefit, and it is hoped that other members may be wilhng\nto follow this helpful and practical course.\nThe Council wish once again to place on record their appreciation\nof the great assistance which the anonymous donation of \u00a31000,\nreceived in 1934, has been in enabhng them to carry out an active\nprogramme of research.\n(9) Endoumient Fund for Psychical Research. By her Will Mrs\nSidgwick bequeathed to the Endowment Fund for Psychical\nResearch the sum of \u00a31000, free of duty.\nIn December Sir Oliver Lodge retired from the Trusteeship of the\nEndowment Fund, and the Council appointed Professor C. D.\nBroad and Mr W. H. Salter in his place and that of the late Mr\n\fPebeuaey1937 Annual Report of the Goimcil for 1935 21\nSydney C. Scott. The Council have expressed to Sir Ohver Lodge\nthanlfs for the services rendered by him as Trustee.\n(10) General Finance. The new Lease of the Society's premises\nwas duly executed on the 15th October 1936, and the repairs re-\nquired by the landlords on the termination of the old Lease have\nl)een carried out. As stated in the Annual Report for 1935, the rent\nrmder the new Lease will be somewhat higher than imder the old,\nand the cost of carrying out the repairs necessitated the selling out\nof part of the Society's capital, mainly by realizing investments\nmade with a view to such expenditure at a time when the Society's\nincome was larger.\nThe Council considered that after fifty years of activity the\nSociety was entitled to make its first appeal outside its own member-\nship for financial assistance. An appeal, supported by the names\nof several highly distinguished members of the Society, has accord-\ningly been sent to various persons outside the Society's membership.\nA copy of this appeal is printed in the current issue of the Journal,\nand it is hoped that members who have friends outside the Society\nhkely to respond to it, will obtain copies from the Secretary, to be\nsent to their friends with a personal letter from themselves.\n(11) Gift of Apparatus. The Council wish to thank Lord Charles\nHope for a generous gift of valuable apparatus used in the experi-\nments with Rudi Schneider in 1932.\n(12) Library. In addition to the books consulted in the Library,\n406 books were borrowed during the year by 77 Members, and\n'68 books were borrowed by the National Central Library for\nStudents. A few books were obtained for Members from the\nNational Central Library. Members are reminded of their privilege\nof borrowing from this organisation, through the Society, books\nwithout restriction of subject.\n(13) Membership of the Society. During the year 37 new Members,\n2 Student Associates, and 2 Honorary Associates were elected. The\ntotal loss in numbers from deaths, resignations and other causes was\n38 Members, 13 Associates, and 1 Honorary xlssociate, leaving a\nnet decrease of 1 Member and 11 Associates. The total membership\nof the Society now stands at 723.\n(14) Publications. Six Parts of Proceedings were pubhshed\nduring the year : Part 144 in April, Part 145 in May, Part 146\nin June, Part 147 in July, Part 148 in October, and Part 149 in\nDecember.\nThe Secretary's sales to the public in Europe amount to \u00a378 3s. Id.\nand to members of the Society, \u00a327 9s. Od. ; the sales in the United\nStates amount to \u00a312 15s.

The Council of the\nSociety are accordingly circulating this appeal to persons whom they\nbeheve to be interested in the advancement of knowledge.\nThe Society was founded in 1882, mainly by the efforts of a group\nof distinguished Cambridge men, Frederic Myers, Henry Sidgwick,\nand Edmund Gurney, and of Professor (later Sir William) Barrett\nof Trinity College, Dublin, to make \" an organized and scientific\nattempt to investigate that large group of debatable phenomena\ndesignated by such terms as . . . psychical and Spirituahstic \", and\napparently not explicable by the known laws of Nature. The policy\nof its founders has always been and is still the policy of the Society.\nIts object is the investigation of facts, and not an attempt to prove\nor disprove any hypothesis.\nNo other organisation has attempted over so long a period of\nyears to conduct an impartial enquiry into these questions, which at\nall times and all over the world have aroused the keenest interest\nand touched the deepest emotions of mankind. For various reasons,\n\f26 Journal of Society for Psychical Research February 193T\nincluding the emotional factor, there is no subject in which im-\npartial enquiry is more essential or more difficult.\nIt would be impossible here to describe all the many branches of\nthe Society's work, but attention may be drawn to the following\npoints :\nTelepathy and Kindred Phenomena. The researches of the\nSociety have produced a large volume of evidence for the existence\nof mental faculties not yet recognised by \" official \" scientific opinion\nbut almost universally accepted by those who have given it intelli-\ngent study. This is in itself an important achievement, and has\nmoreover a close bearing on other branches of the Society's work.\n\" The communication of impressions of any kind from one mind to\nanother, independently of the recognised channels of sense \", is a\nmatter lying at the root of that crucial problem, the survival of\nbodily death and communication between the living and the dead.\nThe Question of Survival. The Society has throughout its\nexistence been investigating this question by every possible line of\napproach. It has conducted a long series of experiments into all\nbranches of mediumship and automatism. Its forty-three volumes\nof Proceedings, and particularly the reports on Mrs Piper and Mrs\nLeonard, are indispensable for every serious student of the question.\nHypnotism and Psycho-therapy. Most of the pioneers in\nscientific hypnotism and in more recent developments of medical\npsychology have been members, and many of them active members,,\nof the Society : Gurney, Janet, Wilham James, C. G. Jung, Sigmund\nFreud. Persons suffering from mental distress often beheve that\nthey have had supernormal experiences ; such persons are from\ntime to time advised by psycho-therapists to consult the officials of\nthe Society, and discuss their difficulties, which as the result of such\ndiscussion are often sensibly relieved.\nDetection of Fraud. Although the exposure of fraudulent\nmediums is not one of the main purposes of the Society, it is a duty\nwhich it has from time to time effectively performed. Too many\npersons who profess to be mediums make a profitable livelihood by^\ntrading on the emotions of the credulous, and particularly of persons\nrecently bereaved. It is of great importance that the Society should\ncontinue to protect the public from imposture and exploitation.\nThe Society is actively pursuing its investigations, to the hmit of\nits financial resources, in the light of its past experiences and with\nthe help of modern experimental and statistical methods. But in\norder to carry out its work the Society's present income is insuffi-\ncient. It has a membership of about 750, whose annual subscrip-\ntions amount to about \u00a31,100, and owing to the abstruse nature of\n\fFebruary 1937 Appeal 27\nmuch of its research it cannot look for any large increase of member-\nship. It has also small endowments, the income from which is\nabout \u00a3400.\nThere are heavy and unavoidable expenses for printing the Pro-\nceedings and Journal, which contain the records of the Society's\ninvestigations (in 1935 approximately \u00a3650) ; for renting premises\nto house the Library, and for the Seance-room and offices ; and for\nconducting all the correspondence incidental to the various branches\nof the Society's work.\nOnly by strict economy, and rehance wherever possible on unpaid\nwork, has it been able to conduct its researches and make them\nknown to the pubUc through its Proceedings.\nThe Council consider that a minimum of \u00a320,000 is required.\nWithout the additional income that an endowment on this scale\nwould produce, there is a risk of the utility of the Society's work\nbeing seriously circumscribed, and they consider that the past\nrecord of the Society, and the importance of the work now being\ndone by it justify them in asking for at least this amount. The\nofficers of the Society will be glad to furnish any other information\ndesired.\nDonations should be sent to the Hon. Treasurer, Rear-Admiral\nthe Hon. A. C. Strutt, R.N., 31 Tavistock Square, London, W.C. 1.\nWhile it is important to the Society to effect an immediate\nincrease of its endowments by donation, the Council would also\nwelcome further endowments by way of legacy.\nWe appeal confidently to all who recognise the importance of an\norganised and impartial enquiry of the widest scope into the nature\nand faculties of the human mind, to place the future of the Society\non a sure foundation.\nC.

Editor of The Jouknal\nMadam,\u2014A note on the observed method of Miss Campbell's\nmediumship may help in judging the type of results shown in Mr\nHerbert's report. At my sitting, and apparently at others, she made\nno approach to trance or semi-trance, but seemed simply to be\ngiving preferential attention to any intuitional promptings that\nmight come up through her normal consciousness. The way in\nwhich these promptings emerge, and are organised into ideas and\nstatements, differs a good deal from what happens when trance or\nsemi-trance has ansesthetised a \" layer \" or two in which secondary\nelaboration takes place. Miss Campbell's phenomena interest me\nmost as throwing some light on the comphcations and confusions\nof normal intuitional process. This kind of effort to express intuition\nis most valuable, for study in relation to other efforts of intuitional\nexpression (as, for example, in the much more highly organised field\nof art) ; but it seems to me that accurate presentation, for evidential\npurposes, of any paranormal impulse that may occur, is likely to\ncome off second best. Miss Campbell seems, in point of fact, to have\norganised her faculties in the direction of suggesting psychical\nadvice rather than of achieving evidential precision.\nI might note, as regards my own sitting, that Mr Herbert is more\nthan right in suggesting that phrases used about my fallacious\nfather-communicator show no manifest connection with Myers.\nThey show none whatever. {Journal, January 1937, top of page 4.\nIncidentally, Mr Herbert is not contradicting himself in this para-\ngraph, but a slip of the pen has produced \" latter \" where he obvi-\nously meant \" former \".) The point which I did not, perhaps, make\nclear was that they resembled other, also unverifiable, remarks\naddressed to me as from Myers by other mediums. Another,\nsimilar, remark has since occurred at a Leonard sitting. I was\nchiefly in search of the motivation that could have produced a\nfallacious father-communicator, not as a passing shot, but as a\nfigure that held the field for a good part of the sitting. My wife,\nalso going to Miss Campbell anonymously, was given a similar\npresentation as being that of her husband's father. Failing any\nother conjecture for the motive-power behind all this, I put it as a\ng;uess that Miss Campbell got hold of some Myers \" configuration\n\"\n(to borrow a concept from Gestalt psychology)\u2014by no means\nnecessarily a \" communication \"\u2014and misinterpreted this into one\nof her habitual presentations of parental figures.\nYours, etc., Kenneth Richmond.\n\fFebruary 1937 Correspondence 29\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal\nMadam,\u2014I see that in my report of the Campbell sittings {Journal\nVol. XXX, page 2, 1937), I have omitted to give the date of\nProfessor Broad's sitting, which is relevant in connection with the\ndate of the birthday given on page 3. The sitting was held on\nJanuary 22, 1936.\nThere is also a mistake on page 4, first paragraph, line 7 :\n\" latter\"\nshould read \" former \". I remain, Madam,\nYour obedient servant,\nC. V. C. Herbert.\nScarcity of Spontaneous Cases\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal\nMadam,\u2014I was, of course, aware that I was one of the persons of\nwhom Professor Schiller was thinking when, in the June (1936) issue\nof the Journal, he again advanced the peculiar ideas of the scientific\nmethod with which his name is associated. I was the ofiicial who\ndeclined to publish the details of the \" apparently supernormal\n\"\nphotograph mentioned by Professor Schiller. I did so for the very\nsimple reason that I did not think that it was \" apparently super-\nnormal \". Professor Schiller did, and I suggested to him that he\nshould publish it himself. This he refused to do.\nI have no doubt that it would be possible to collect laboriously\nhundreds of modern conjuring effects which are \" apparently super-\nnormal \" if the performers call themselves mediums. As a matter\nof fact the Society does collect a certain number of such effects as\nMr Herbert has pointed out.\nPersonally I fail to see how publishing a thousand tales of cards\nrising out of crystal goblets will ever advance the probability of these\npasteboards \" really \" behaving in this manner \" by themselves \",,\nbut then I am not a logician but an experimenter.\nYours, etc., E. J. Dingwall.\n(?) A Fulfilled Prediction\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal\nMadam,\u2014On June 29, 1902, at a sitting in London for clair-\nvoyance with Miss K. Wingfield as medium, the following message\nwas spelt out :\n\" Tell the nation that eventually there will be two kings alive\ntogether.\"\n\f30 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Febetjaby 1937\nThe record of this message has been preserved in a pocket-book\nand there is corroboration in a letter from one of the sitters. These\ndocuments are at the Society's rooms.\nMy impression on receiving the message in 1902 was that it could\nonly be fulfilled by an abdication.\nI still think so, and that the prediction was fulfilled on Dec. 11,\nYours, etc., Lawbence J. Jones.\nThe Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal\nMadam,\u2014In a letter to the Journal (Oct. 1936), Mr Whately\nCarington, speaking of Mrs E. Garrett's reactions during his recent\ntrance personaUty tests, informs Miss Naumburg of two observa-\ntions that I am glad to be able to substantiate.\n(1) We are told that the medium's p.g. reflexes faded rapidly\nduring the tests, while her skin resistance, initially high, also quickly\nrose.\nAs I have observed similar effects in several undoubtedly hys-\nterical subjects, possessing otherwise thin, moist skin and good\nnormal circulation, and that accompanied by evident tactile anaes-\nthesia ; one may be allowed to suppose that such a condition is,\nperhaps, typical of certain hysterical and \" mediumistic \" subjects.\nNote also that nocturnal paralysis, plus various degrees of anaes-\nthesia, has frequently been recorded by persons who claim to have\nexperienced \" astral \" projection.\nThe falling off of the reflexes, if in excess of ordinary boredom\nand fatigue effects, is probably part and parcel of such increasing\nskin resistance and loss of sensation ;\nfor, although the psychogenic\nemotions may still remain active, their physiological concomitants\n{e.g. the p.g. reflexes) can quite easily disappear, owing to neural\nparalysis in association with some special trance, or other psycho-\nphysical, condition of the subject.\nIt should also be remarked, in passing, that, apart from the\ndeterminable effects of capillary circulation, increasing skin resist-\nance is abnormal in p.g. reflex work ; as it has been found * that\n(other things being equal) the passage of a direct current through\nthe skin of a human subject results in a progressive fall of elec-\ntrical resistance, proportional to the appUed e.m.f. An alternating\ncurrent, however, has no such effect ; so that the present writer is\n* A paper on this effect and the technical advantages of an A.C. circuit is\nnow in preparation by J. A. Lauwerys and myself, for publication, very\nshortly, in a suitable physiological journal.\n\fFebruaey 1937 Correspondence 31\nnow employing A.C. in place of D.C., in a new type of circuit, in\norder to eliminate the negative drift that has always been a nuisance\nto workers in this field.\n(2) It is true enough, as Miss Naumburg suggests, that the effects\nof certain stimulus words normally die down with increasing famih-\narity, but only in so far as all reaction times to a given set of words\ntend progressively to shorten with repetition. That being so, the\noutstanding responses tend to remain outstanding, if they are of\ngeniiine significance, thus presenting a sort of key to the given\npersonality, as Mr Carington has rightly appreciated.\nIn a previous note on Mr Carington's investigation I referred to\nsuch a process of quickening as \" mental facihtation \" ; and it has\nbeen found that very smooth and convincing curves can be drawn\nfrom the mean reaction times on successive occasions, to any given\nbatch of stimulus words, for a given subject.\nIn this connection, it is also of interest to note that (\u00ab) after a\ncertain number of repetitions, a minimum mean reaction time is\nattainable ; (6) that several recitations on the same day are finally\nnecessary to reach that \" rock-bottom \" value, a small rise in the\nvalue subsequently occurring through lack of repetitive practice ;\nand (c) that, granted a good many recitations in the first place, even\nafter a whole year, an almost \" rock bottom \" value ^\\^ll be main-\ntained by a given subject. At the same time, we found that a few\n(between 5% and 30%, according to the subject) quite novel word\nresponses were given after such a long lapse of time.\nIt seems to me that these latter facts are of considerable import-\nance in connection with the sort of investigation that Mr Carington\nhas devised ;\nespecially if it were proposed to take such \" mental\nfinger-prints \" of personalities, first, while living and, second, post\nmortem, via a trance medium or automatist. May I, therefore,\ncommend these considerations to the attention of those who have\nany such procedure in mind ?\nYours truly, J. Cecil Maby.\nREVIEWS\nRecollections and Reflections. By Sir J. J. Thomson, O.M., D.Sc,\nF.R.S., Master of Trinity College, Cambridge. London, G. Bell\n& Sons, Ltd. 1936.\nSir J. J. Thomson, a Vice-President of our Society and one of the\nmost distinguished of Hving physicists has recently published a\nvolume of reminiscences Recollections and Reflections, in which he\nhas a chapter on psychical research.\n\f32 Journal of Society for Psychical Research February 193T\nThe only personal experiences lie reports are a few sittings witk\nthe slate-writer, Eglinton, and with Eusapia Palladino, in which he^\nobserved nothing that he thought of evidential value, except as\nevidence of fraud. He has, however, kept an open mind as to the\npossible occurrence of supernormal phenomena.\nHe attaches great importance to further experiments in telepathjr\nand especially to short-distance telepathy such as has been observed\nin the case of Professor Gilbert Murray. \" It is quite possible \", h&\nsays, \" indeed very probable that it may turn out to be of an\nentirely different character \" from telepathy occurring over long;\ndistances. He quotes with approval the saying by the late Lord\nRayleigh in his Presidential Address to this Society \" To my mind\ntelepathy with the dead would present comparatively little diffi-\nculty when it is admitted as regards the living. If the apparatus of\nthe senses is not used in one case, why should it be needed in the\nother ?\nHe concludes his chapter with a section on dowsing, in which he\nagain stresses the need for further experiment with a special view\nto testing the opinion held by some dowsers that they respond to a\nphysical effect of some kind, akin to radiation. In this connection\nSir J. J. Thomson remarks that \" it may be pertinent to say that\nin the early days of radio-activity at the beginning of the century,\nI examined specimens of water freshly drawn from a good many-\nwells in different parts of England and found that they all, though\nin very different degrees, contained the radio-active emanation from\nradium. This only retains its activity for four days, so that if the\nwater were stagnant it would soon lose its radio-activity. Thus, if\nthis were connected with the effect produced on the dowser, it would\nexplain why it is that he can only detect running water \".\nIn a chapter on \" Physics in My Time \" he discusses and criticises\nCrookes' experiments with D. D. Home ; and a chapter entitled \" Some\nTrinity Men \" has a commendatory reference to the work of our\nSociety in some reminiscences of Henry Sidgwick, where reference\nis made to the part played by Sidgwick in the Society's foundation.\nH. de G.

H. Salter on the 30 September 1936\nMr Salter began by saying that his own personal bias was not at\nall in favour of statistics, and that he would be most reluctant to see\nPsychical Research handed over entirely to the expert, whether the\nstatistical expert or any other, and the average citizen warned off.\nNo officer of a Society with so many distinguished scientific names\non its Presidential Roll was likely to under-value the contribution\nof the scientists to Psychical Research ; but it was a plain fact that\na preponderant share in the develoj)ment of our work had fallen on\nmen and women, not exclusively or in the main, scientific.\nThe primary function of the S.P.R. was to bring the whole subject\nof Psychical Research out of the morass of nebulous uncertain sub-\njectivity to the terra firma of common sense workaday fact ; to\nformulate canons of evidence adapted to the particular sort of\noccurrences with which it had to deal with a view to producing a\nbody of fact which educated people could accept with the same\ndegree of certainty that they look for in arriving at a decision of any\nmatter of practical importance in their own lives. The success of\nthe Society in achieving this object was due largely to the fact that\nit was a Society since, in formulating and maintaining evidential\nstandards, the continuous organised co-operation of many minds\nhad many advantages over the free-lance investigations of any indi-\nvidual, however brilHant ; but it was equally due to the co-operation\nof the scientist and the man of practical experience in deahng with\nthe particular material which is the subject of Psychical Research.\nMr Salter quoted with commendation a passage from Mr Pidding-\nton's Presidential Address (Proc. Vol. 34, pp. 138-9). He reminded\nmembers that while in comparison with the distinguished scientists\n\fMaech 1937 Statistical and other Technicalities 35\nwho had adorned the Presidential Chair, the generaHty of the\nSociety must rank as laity, in comparison with the outside pubhc\nthey were one and all experts. They were so famiUar, for instance,\nwith the rules of evidence estabhshed by the founders of the Society\nin relation to spontaneous experiences, that the necessity for\nobserving them seemed to members of the S.P.R. self-evident.\nIt came as something of a shock to find that outside the Society,\npersons\u2014often highly intelhgent persons\u2014did not see the need for\nthese rules, and flagrantly contravened them. He cited as examples\ntwo well-known books : An Adventure and An Experiment With\nTime, the value of both of which was greatly diminished by neglect\nof elementary rules of evidence.\nTurning to other kinds of technicality with which Psychical\nResearchers were from time to time confronted, Mr Salter referred\nto cases where it was claimed that mediums in trance had displayed\nlearning beyond their normal educational attainments. For\nexample, to judge VaUantine's phenomena, it was necessary to\napply to persons who knew the many different languages which\nVaUantine's \" Direct Voice \" professed to be able to speak ; to check\nthe claims of a recent medium who professed to be inspired by the\nFrench Astronomer, Flammarion, recourse had to be made to some-\none with more than superficial astronomical knowledge. The\nphysical phenomena on account of their variety and heterogeneity\nwere even more difficult in this respect than the mental. The case,\nfor instance, of the \" Marjorie \" thumb-prints seemed fairly simple\nwhen first raised by Mr Dudley, but when, after two years' interval,\nthe reply to Mr Dudley's charges appeared, there was attached to\nit a bibliography containing entries relating to the most diverse\nbranches of science, including a monograph on \" The Modes of In-\nheritance of Aggregates of Meristic (Integral) Variates in the Poly-\nembryonic Offspring of the Nine Banded Armadillo \", and also\nseveral treatises on Relativity. Until he had mastered these and\nother equally abstruse, and at first sight irrelevant, subjects, the\nreader was not apparently deemed capable of judging whether the\n\" Walter \" thumb-prints were fakes or not.\nHowever much we might dishke statistics, they were and always\nhad been essential in the very wide field of Psychical Research in\nwhich the issue was ;\ngranted the correspondence between experi-\nence and event, was it such as could be attributed to chance. The\nearliest volumes of S.P.R. Proceedings contain a good deal of stat-\nistical matter in relation to thought transference, experiments with\ncards, etc. Statistics had been used both in \" Phantasms of the\nLiving\" and in the \"Census of Hallucinations\" reported on in\n\f36 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1937\nProceedings, Vol. 10, to evaluate certain classes of spontaneous\nphenomena.\nAdmittedly, our researches had in recent years become more\nstatistical, but in this. Psychical Research was following the example\nof the more orthodox sciences in which the domain of statistics was\ncontinually being extended.\nNo Psychical Researcher could rest content while the field of\nmediumistic communication still remained, in a large part, un-\nreclaimed from uncertainty and subjectivity. There seemed to be\ntwo factors of uncertainty operating sometimes separately, some-\ntimes in combination. There was first the doubt the student often\nfelt as to whether he was being told all the relevant facts, and\nsecondly, the doubt whether correspondences between communica-\ntion and external fact were in any particular case exphcable by\nchance or some other normal cause.\nMr Salter said he was glad to hear of recent experiments by\nMembers of the Society in the nature of control experiments applied\nto Sittings. He thought, however, that any experienced student of\nSittings would have no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that\nsome communications were clearly within the scope of chance pro-\nbability, and others as clearly outside it ; and that it was a waste of\ntime to pay too much attention to any that were not well outside\nchance probability. The technicahty of Proxy Sittiugs as developed\nby Miss Nea Walker and Mr Drayton Thomas was helpful in re-\nducing the element of uncertainty.\nIn conclusion, Mr Salter referred to the use of the word association\ntest by Mr Whateley Carington, and of the statistical analysis\nbased thereon. It seemed to him that quantitative analysis held\nout a prospect of attaining precision in the classification and analysis\nof mental states, which was not attainable by other methods.\nIt was a comparatively new technique, and would doubtless\nundergo many modifications as the result of experience, but it could\nhardly be doubted that the results already attained had thrown\nfresh and vmexpected fight on the status of Controls and communi-\ncators. It remained to be seen whether there was complete agree-\nment on this matter between quantitative and quahtative methods.\nIf, after further research, there remained differences which could\nnot be reconciled, the inference would seem to be that the two\nmodes of analysis were dealing with different subject matters,\ndifferent levels of personaUty, perhaps.\n\fMarch 1937 Notes 071 Recent Research 37\nNOTES ON EECENT EESEARCH\nThe work on the Garrett Absent Sitter experiment is being con-\ntinued. A further sitting in connection with the Irving-Leonard\nexperiment produced no result, but the tests are to be continued.\nAn interesting Leonard Proxy Case has been communicated to the\nSociety by The Rev. C. Drayton Thomas. It is hoped that a report\nof this may be printed or pubhshed later.\nA number of \" spontaneous cases \" have been examined, the\nrecords of which may be consulted by Members and Associates at\nthe Society's Rooms. In connection with the Raynham Hall\n\" ghost photograph \" (see Country Life, 1936, December 26, p. 673),\nthe Research Officer interviewed the photographers, and inspected\nthe negatives. His report can be seen at the Rooms. An interesting\naccount by Mr L. E. Eeman of a case of obsession has been com-\nmunicated to the Society by Mr Maby. It is available to Members\nand Associates at the Society's Rooms.\nMr Richmond's investigation of the recorded Leonard material\nis proceeding with the extensive records of \" Dora \" communica-\ntions, kindly lent by the Rev. W. S. Irving. There are also some\nparticularly good voice-records of this communicator, which promise\nto repay detailed analysis of syllable-timing and intonation.\nFollowing a suggestion by The Hon. ]\\Irs Alfred Lyttelton, a\nseries of Study Groups has been formed within the Society. The\nGroups, which have been authorized by the Council at a recent\nmeeting, each consist of a leader or Convener and one or more other\nMembers or Associates. Groups are already working on the follow-\ning subjects : The phenomena of Witchcraft, Haunted Houses,\n\" Cross Correspondence \", Evidence of Intention, Luminous Pheno-\nmena.

Sidgwick &\nJackson.\nThis book will be of some interest to psychical researchers. Dr\nSchmidt is one of the greatest German authorities on Palaeolithic man.\nHis book divides into four sections. The Introduction deals with\nThe Soul and the Innate Memory. Part I with the scene of his sub-\nject, the earth in the Ice Ages. Part II with the development of the\nphysical structure of man through those ages. Part III with the\ndevelopment of consciousness in this form. Dr Schmidt traces a\nconnection between the gradually enlarging skull and the gradually\nimproving technique in tool-shaping and in drawing and carving.\nThe book is a massive one elaborately illustrated. The ideas of the\nProfessor are also elaborate. He beheves that he can trace what he\ncalls a \" dark optimum \" and a \" bright optimum \" art, the one of\nthe north and the cave and the perquisite of the magician and the\nother of the south and the open shelter and the man of action. He\nbelieves that apart from this division man goes through three stages\nwhich can be traced in his art, Magical, Animistic and Symbohc. He\nsees man pass from making those amazing representational pictures\nof beasts, with an occasional picture of a face-less woman of fecun-\ndity, to those scrawls of action where there is no anatomy but the\nstory-telHng vigour of a child's drawing. He allows that the earher\nstyle is eidetic and in his voluminous bibliography Jaensch's work is\nquoted but there is no reference to Jaensch's important discovery\nthat such imagery may be equated with hme deficiency affecting the\nparathyroids. Why man's consciousness should have evolved at\nsuch an unprecedented speed\u2014if we compare that sjieed with the\ndevelopment of any other species' features\u2014he does not speculate, nor\nwhether in that advance which leads us to the power of abstraction\nwhich has been ours since the neolithic, we may have lost certain\ndawning capacities. He points out that when men took to fractional\nburial and carefully picked off the heads of the dead and kept them\nin red ochre they probably had begun to think of mind as apart from\nbody, and when they placed these heads (as at Ofnet) facing to the\nWest they may have risen to a sky cosmology. Beyond that the\nProfessor does not go. The remainder of his theory is confined to\nstating that the past still hves in us and repeats itself in the child.\nIt is a pity that a man equipped with such immense factual know-\nledge and with a mind so inchned to interesting theory should not\nhave been more acquainted with our subject. Perhaps nowadays\n\f40 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Maech 1937\nPsychical Eesearch and all the psychological side of anthropology is\ndangerous ground, for, with race theories and dogmas become matters\nof faith and morals, any theory or mythos other than the govern-\nment's may point to a concentration camp. Certainly it seems\nstrange that in a book of such scholarship the author should have to\ngive a footnote to explain the word Mana. However, we must be\ngrateful for what is given and it is much. But the psychical re-\nsearcher will probably find that the physiological sections of the book\nare more informative and interesting to him than the psychological\n\u2014\nwhich is a httle sad in a book entitled \" The Dawn of the Human\nMind \". G. H.\nWilfred Brandon, transcribed by Edith Ellis, O-pen the Door !\nPp. xxi, 172 ;\nIncarnation, pp. xxi, 195. Alfred Knopf. Price\n$2.00 each.\nThese two books are not easy to review. They are obviously the\ngenuine product of a remarkable automatist whose career and\noccupation prove her to be a woman of exceptional intelligence and\ntalent. It is best perhaps to leave readers to form their own con-\nclusions about the actual value of the content of the books. The\nmost interesting is the one called Incarnation, and it contains an\naccount of the process of incarnation which is extremely curious.\nWhat differentiates both these volumes from most productions of\nthe kind is their insistence upon the danger to the human race,\nboth on this earth and in the next life, if the fact of survival is\nignored. The communicator fears a retrogression on both planes\nand expostulates thus :\n\" We have no reason to believe that it\nwould be more difficult for you to discover ivliy we can communicate\nthrough some people (mediums) and not through others, than to\nmake any other of your experiments in radio-activity.\" (Incarnation,\np. 175). \" You are afraid to learn by scientific means what we have\nto tell you of the '\nreal world '. A few thousand dollars spent in\nsubsidising your radio experts and half a dozen trance or working\nmediums would allow of sufficient experimentation, so that we could\nspeak to you as now you use wireless telegraphy and telephony or\ncode signals \" {Incarnation, p. 124), and later again, \" television . . .\nhas now reached a point where it will be the forerunner to radio\ncommunication between the world you know and ours.\" The worst\nof it is that we cannot imagine scientists moved by an appeal from\na source which lies fantastically beyond their vision of reality. Some\nday, perhaps, parts of these books will be recognised to be what they\nclaim to be\u2014messages from a discarnate being. At present we can\nonly treat them as psychological curiosities. Even as such, they are\n\fMarch 1937 Reviews 41\ndeeply interesting and suggestive and might stimulate an extension\nof research. Incidentally readers are exhorted to support Societies\nfor Psychical Research, and amazement is expressed that so httle\nhelp is forthcoming. This is gratifying and imusual. We are more\naccustomed to complaints from \" communicators \" of our obtuseness\nand thick-sighted obstinacy. However, Wilfrid Brandon concludes\nthat ' the thing to strive for now is the mechanical device (for\ncommunication with the next world) that will stand every test\nanywhere at any time.\"\u2014Quite ! E. L.\nThe Controls of Geraldine Cummins. Being an attempt to Prove that\nthey are Entities separate from each other, and from the Aiito-\nmatist. By E. B. Gibbes. The Grosvenor Press. Is.\nMiss Gibbes has had much experience of the automatic writings\nof Mss Geraldine Cummins, and in this Httle book, she describes\nthe personahties of the two controls connected with the phenomena\nand gives her reasons for concluding that they are separate entities,\nand for adopting the spiritistic hypothesis with regard to them.\nThese reasons, she bases on the fact that each control, (one\nclaims to be an ancient Greek, the other an early Christian) has his\nown strongly marked personahty and characteristics, including\nhandwriting.\nRecent research seems to have indicated that while medimnistic\ncontrols may very well be secondary personahties of their mediums,\nit does not necessarily follow that the communicators come into the\nsame category. We cannot therefore agree with Miss Gibbes when\nshe says in her final paragraph (page 30),\n\" No, these entities\nappear to me to be something more than subhmuial creations. If\nwe are to attribute them to the subconscious mind, it would seem\nthat numerous other entities (who have written through her and\nproved their identity) must also be the invention of that convenient\nreceptacle for the imaccountable.\"\nThe account of the personahties of the two controls is however of\ngreat interest, and this further information about Mss Cummins'\nmediumship will be welcomed by psychical researchers generally,\nand students of automatism in particular.\nS. R. W. W.\nMrs Rhys Davids, D.Litt., M.A., What is your Will ? Pp. 223.\n(London : Rider & Co.). 1937. Price 6s. net.\nMrs Rhys Davids is well-known for her studies of Buddhist\nliterature and these studies have largely coloured this book. It is\nin part a criticism of modern psychology and philosophy, and in\n\f42 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1937\nparticular of what the author considers their undue neglect, both\nof the concept and of the word Will, and in part a record of her own\npsychical experiences. The author has sat with mediums, including\nMrs Leonard, and has herself practised automatic writing. In con-\nsequence of the messages she has received, especially through her\nautomatic writing, she puts forward a religious and philosophical\nscheme which, so far as it departs from ideas generally current,\nseems to have been considerably influenced by her previous studies\nof Buddhism. The author's style and phraseology do not make the\nreading of the book altogether easy.\nW. H. S.\nMr Sludge, the Medium. Being the life and adventure of Daniel\nDunglas Home. By Horace Wyndham. Geofeey Bles,\n2 Manchester Square, London.\nA very wide reader, the author of The Mayfair Calendar, Famous\ntrials retold, etc. undertakes to give us this time an accoimt of D. D.\nHome's extraordinary curriculum vitae. (It was Robert Browning,\nit will be remembered, who was pleased to dub him \" Mr Sludge \",\nwhilst to Dickens he was \" Home the humbug \").\nAs the book deals with other mediums besides Home or Hume\n(in Russia, which he visited repeatedly, he was called \" Hume \"\ninvariably and, I think, nem. eontr. !), such as the Fox sisters, Mrs\nHayden, Miss Florence Cook, etc., I will begin by saying a few words\non the Rochester (or rather the Hydesville) knockings. The author\nalludes of course to the well-known theory that they were produced\nby the sisters cracking their toe-joints at will. I may recall in this\nconnection a letter of mine pubhshed in our Journal as long ago as\nJune 1893, and I may add here that the late Aksakoff, who had seen\nKate Fox-Jencken himself in St Petersburg in the early eighties,\nstated to me after hearing the raps I produced, that they sounded\nexactly like hers. Which circumstance did not of course prevent\nhis continuing to believe in the authenticity of the latter.\nWith regard to D. D. Home Mr Wyndham has accumulated a\nmass of evidence, some of which is valuable. I am afraid he is hkely\nto be fiercely attacked by Spiritualists on account of his tone, which\nthey may think not by any means worthy of such a subject.\nAs some importance was attached many years ago by the late\nF. W. H. Myers and Sir W. F. Barrett to iirs Home's biographical\nstudy I). D. Home, his life and mission, published in 1888, two\nyears after Home's death, I may as well point out here that in Mr\nWyndham's opinion this book is a \" labour of love \"\n(p. 288), which\neither ignores or puts a gloss on certain incidents in Home's career.\n\fMaech 1937 Reviews 43\nI agree with this judgment so far at least as Home's alleged ex-\nposure at Biarritz in September 1857 is concerned (as to which see\nmy paper, \" Some thoughts on D. D. Home \" in Proceedings,\npart 114, and Mr Sludge the Medium, pp. 82-85).\nWithout claiming\u2014which would obviously have been absurd\n\u2014\nthat what I shall call the \" foot hypothesis \" explains the whole\nbulk of Home's manifestations, I still maintain that it will explain a\ngood deal and will here call the reader's attention to such incidents\nas those mentioned by Mr Wjudham on pp. 49, 76, 81-85. Though\nthere was no exposure, action of the feet is strongly suggested,\ne.g. in John Bright's account of a seance on p. 119 (the more so as\nhe insists on \" all hands on the table at the time \"), whilst on p. 90\nwe read :\n\" The fact too that he (Home) wore elastic-sided boots (popularly\ntermed '\njemimas ') which could be slipped off and on very easily,\nwas held to be suspicious.\" (Cf. Proceedings, part 114, pp. 252-253.)\nThough the author is, as I have said, a very wide reader, there\nare in the book not a few inaccuracies which we shall hope to see no\nmore in a second edition. In other cases important statements are\nmade for which chapter and verse are not given. On p. 257, e.g. we\nare told that Crookes subsequently destroyed all photographs of\n\" Katie Bang \", forbade their reproduction and also destroyed the\nnegatives. \" This suggests that Crookes himself had doubts as to\ntheir genuineness.\" I do not demur to these statements of Mr\nWyndham's, but wonder on what evidence they are based ?\nHere are some distinct inaccuracies :\nOn p. 256 we are told that Crookes, \" did once see two separate\nfigures in the cabinet \" (at the Florence Cook seances), but that on\nthis occasion \" Miss Cook's face was not visible as her head had to\nbe closely bound up in a thick shawl \". I hold no brief for Katie\nKing, but I well remember Crookes describing how he distinctly saw\nboth Katie and the medium at the last sitting of the series taldng\nleave of each other (this account of Crookes's was published by the\nway not in the Quarterly Journal of Science, as ]\\'Ir Wyndham says\non p. 259, but, so far as I can remember at least, in the Spiritualist).\nOn the other hand the author being a sceptic might have rein-\nforced his position by stating that several of the Katie King seances\ntook place in the home of Mr and Mrs Cook (the last seance in parti-\ncular), whilst no account of these historical sittings can be complete\nwithout mentioning the celebrated electrical test appHed to Florence\nCook by Crookes and Varley. But why speak at length about Katie\nKing in a book about Home ?\nAn omission not less regrettable strikes the reader in Mr Wynd-\n\f44 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Maech1937\nham's account of Crookes's experiments with D. D. Home, where\nno mention is made of the alteration of the weight of a partially\nsuspended board. On the other hand D. D. Home never dealt in\n\" production of flowers out of thin air \"\n(p. 295) and I think it dis-\ntinctly inexact to say that Crookes's \" bizarre \" experiments were\nconducted in his laboratory \" simultaneously \" with D. D. Home\nand Kate Fox (Mrs Jencken). In any case Crookes's pubhshed\naccounts do not seem to me to warrant such a contention. Never-\ntheless it is unfortunately quite true that\u2014as pointed out, I beheve,\nfor the first time by Dr Fournier d'Albe\u2014Crookes was not averse\nto taking part in a seance with three mediums at once : Herne,\nWilliams and Home (oj). cit. p. 226). The seance was of course a dark\none : it throws nevertheless a good deal of hght\u2014possibly lurid\nlight, I am afraid\u2014on Crookes as an investigator of spirituahstic\nphenomena.\nOne more erroneous statement only, and I have done with that\npart of my subject (though I might make the series still longer).\nOn page 226 Mr Wyndham tells us d j^^opos of the Dialectical\nSociety's report on Spiritualism that \" while three of the sub-com-\nmittees merely saw tables revolve, the other three . . . saw nothing\nat all \". As a matter of fact the experiments of one of these sub-\ncommittees on movements of tables (apparently) without contact\nseem to suggest even to-day that something hke telekinesis may be\n\" a fact in nature \" after all.\nThose of us who still fondly cherish a behef in the genuineness of\nHome's \" manifestations \" will possibly welcome the mistakes and\nomissions I have been able to point out in the most recent work\nwhich attempts to demohsh his reputation. Well, I must say that\nthis work is a valuable one nevertheless. It contains a mass of\nmaterial, some of which while thoroughly deserving our attention\nis besides relatively difficult of access in England (such for instance\nas various French memoirs dealing with the Second Empire). With\nmany of Mr Wyndham's statements I find myself in at least partial\nagreement. Though I will not say as the author does ^ that the\n\" tests to which Home was subjected by him (Crookes) were childish\n\"\n(p. 227), I certainly think some of these experiments or observations\nopen to very grave doubts. That \" blue blood \" (though I disHke\nthe term) \" is not necessarily equipped to solve the secrets of\n^ I am not sure, however, these are Mr Wyndham's words. He seems in\nthis passage to be quoting Sir W. F. Barrett. But surely Sir W. F. Barrett\ncould not have written anything of the kind nor added :\n\" Hence it is not out\nof the way for a brother scientist to declare :\n\" Mr Crookes's methods are a\npremium upon knavery \" ? Who was this \" brother Scientist \" ? ! ? !\n\fMaech 1937 Reviews 45\nmediumship \"\n(p. 240) I thoroughly agree ; as also that the theory\nwhich maintains that a medium who does not conduct his seances\nfor cash down is necessarily above suspicion is unwarranted (p. 291).\nThat the career of D. D. Home is not by any means above suspicion\nI attempted to prove as far back as 1912 (S.P.R. Journal). And that\nLord Dunraven's Experiences in Spiritualism reprinted in our Pro-\nceedings in 1924 show that there had been at these sittings parti-\ncularly favourable opportunities for cheating I tried to show in a\npaper pubhshed in the Proceedings in 1930, whilst for ]\\Ir Wyndham\nthe record reveals that Home directed and controlled the sittings\nfrom start to finish (p. 239).\nBefore I end may I be allowed to add that the hnes with which\nMr Wyndham finishes his interesting work do not meet with my\napproval ? He hesitates apparently to say whether in his opinion\nCrookes, Barrett, de Morgan and Wallace on the one hand, or Darwin,\nFaraday, Huxley and Tyndall on the other, were right and calls this\nproblem a baffling one and one \" that still puzzles spirituahsts and\nmateriahsts alike \"\n(p. 298). So far so good : hesitation in this\nrespect may be permissible after all even to-day. But why does\nhe add :\n\" The solution can only be furnished by himself. Yet during the\nfifty years he has been among them . . . Daniel Dunglas Home,\nthe 'King of Mediums', has never once come back from the shades\nto attend a seance and confound the sceptics.\"\nThere are many flippant sentences and very superficial judgments\nin Mr Wyndham's book, but this is one of the most glaring samples.\nWhat has Home's complete silence since his death to do with the\nquestion whether his phenomena were genuine or fraudulent ? Such\nan \" argument \", is sadly out of place in a work claiming to present\nan objective ^ if not scientific account of the celebrated mediimi's\ncareer\n!\nPerovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.\n^ As I use here this adjective I will add that though most obviously hostile\nto D. D. Home, the author is in fact objective enough to admit that the atti-\ntude of some scientists of the time versus this medium left something to be\ndesired. Thus of Dr W. Carpenter he says (p. 245) that his paper against\n\" Spiritualism and its recent converts \" in the Quarterly Review of October\n1871 \" was instinct with prejudice and inaccuracy \".\n\f46 Jotmicd of Society for Psychicctl Research March 1937\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS\nRevue Metapsychique.\nNovember-December 1936.\n\u2014\" The Problem of tlie Stigmatics and\nits Metapsychic Interest,\" by Dr Jean Vinchon.

The President in the Chair.\n\fApril 1937 Annual General Meeting 53\nThe following Members were jJreseat : Mrs A. H. Bell, Sir Ernest\nBennett, M.P., Miss Estella Canziani, Miss M. C. Crosfield, Dr E. J.\nDingwall, Mr C. V. C. Herbert, Miss Gertrude Johnson, Sir Lawrence\nJones, Bart., the Hon. Mrs Alfred Lyttelton, G.B.E., Dr W. Malone,\nCount Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo, Mr W. H. Salter, Mr S. G. Soal,\nAdmiral the Hon. A. C. Strutt, R.N., the Rev. C. Drayton Thomas,\nMr G. N. M. Tyrrell, Mrs B. VarviU ; and Mr C. F. Wilkins (Asso-\nciate).\nThe Secretary having read the Notice convening the Meeting, the\nPresident spoke of the loss the Society had sustained through the\ndeath of Mr Sydney C. Scott, who had been a good friend to the\nSociety for many years, and said that the Society owed a great\ndeal to him. He also referred to Professor Eraser-Harris's death.\nHe mentioned the Appeal which the Society is making for a Eund\nto provide an Endowment, and hoped that Members would bring\nthe Appeal to the notice of those who would be hkely to contribute.\nHe then called upon the Hon. Treasurer, Admiral Strutt, to make\nhis financial statement.\nAdmiral Strutt, in presenting the accounts for the year, regretted\nto report that the real result of the year was that the Society had\nspent \u00a388 more than its income. The lease of 31 Tavistock Square\nhad fallen in and the Society was put to expense for dilapidations.\nThat had been met by realising investments made to meet this\ncontingency out of the Society's savings some years ago. The sur-\nplus expenditure of \u00a388 was in addition to the expenditure under\nthat head, so that next year, if the Society did not make economies,\nit would be \u00a388 down again. It was very difficult to see where it\ncould economise more than it had done recently. There was one\nray of hope because for some time Miss Newton had been engaged\nin correspondence with the Revenue authorities, with a view to\nobtaining exemption from Income Tax. If this claim for exemption\nsucceeded, it would mean quite a lot to the Society, not only as\nregards the future, but in repayment of tax already paid. He ap-\npealed to members to endeavour to get new members.\nThe question of reviving the election of Associates was raised :\nthe Hon. Secretary pointed out the risk that, if this were done,\nexisting Members might ask to be transferred to the List of Asso-\nciates, which would cause the Society heavy financial loss.\nMr Tyrrell doubted whether the best use was always made of the\nmass of facts accumulated by the Society. Much good evidence\ntended to slip into obHvion, first because it was not sufficiently\nimpressed on the public, but still more because the Society had\nconcentrated on fact to the neglect of theory. In other branches of\n\f54 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1937\nscience the collection of facts, and the construction of tentative\ntheories to explain them proceeded side by side. He would Uke to\nsee a periodical assessment of work done, with special attention to\ncriticism of method. This would be of great help to the individual\nworker, who at present was left in uncertainty as to whether the\nmethods he was using could be considered watertight. The assess-\nment should be done by a Committee of the Society, a summary of\nwhose conclusions should be sent to the leading psychological\njournals.\nDr Dingwall said he would prefer the work of theoretical criticism\nto be done by private members, who might form their own groups,\nrather than by a Committee whose judgments might appear to\nrepresent the corporate opinion of the Society.\nThe Hon. Secretary, agreeing with the last speaker, reminded\nmembers that in the Committee of Reference and the Research\nCommittee they already had two active critical bodies. He hoped\nmembers would submit their own theoretical observations for print-\ning in the Journal or Proceedings.\nThe President also agreed with Dr Dingwall. He thought there\nwas no very close analogy between psychical research and the better\nestabhshed sciences . It was too much to suppose that any Committee\nof the Society could put forward a theory which would account, for\nexample, for the results of Mr Tyrrell's investigations. He under-\nstood it was not easy to get papers on new research work for their\nmonthly meetings, and thought it would be useful if members would\nfrom time to time work over already pubhshed material critically,\nand discuss it at meetings. He thought there was much to be said\nfor the practice prevailing in some Societies whereby the reader of\nthe paper showed the paper before it was read to some other person\nwho was thereby prepared to open a discussion on it.\nThe question of having occasionally quite short papers, so as to\nallow of more time for discussion, was raised, and Mr Gregory\noffered to open a discussion meeting of this kind in the near\nfuture.\nMrs Bell, Sir Lawrence Jones, Dame Edith Lyttelton. Sir Ernest\nBennett, and the Rev. C. Drayton Thomas also took part in the\ndiscussion.\nDr Dingwall criticised the Appeal for Funds as not being wholly\nscientific, either in its terms or in the personality of the signatories.\nThe President annoimced that there were no candidates for\nelection to membership of the Council other than the six members\nwho retired by rotation. The following six members were accord-\ningly elected : Lord Charles Hope, Mr G. AV. Lambert, Dr T. W.\n\fApril 1937 Annual General Meeting 55\nMitchell, Mr W. H. Salter, Mrs W. H. Salter and Admiral the Hon.\nA. C. Strutt.\nn 1. T7- \u2022\n1\nThe President then moved that the Report and the l^mancial\nStatement be adopted. This resolution was seconded by the Rev.\nDrayton Thomas and carried unanimously.\nMessrs Miall, Avery & Co. were re-elected Auditors for the\nforthcoming year.\nA REPETITION OF DR J. B. RHINE'S WORK IN\nEXTRA-SENSORY PERCEPTION\nBy S. G. Soal\nAt a Private Meeting of the Society on 27 January, the writer gave\nan interim report of experiments in Extra-Sensory Perception carried\nout by him during the past two and a half years with a view to in-\nvestigating the possibilities of Dr Rhine's technique. This work,\ndone under the auspices of the University of London Council for\nPsychical Investigation, was undertaken in the Council's laboratory\nat 13d Roland Gardens but has been recently transferred to the\nPsychological laboratory at University College.\nAt the time of writing 93 subjects have been tested and upwards\nof 70,000 guesses recorded. The cards used were made by a firm of\nplaying-card manufacturers and are inscribed with five simple t>^3es\nof geometrical symbols similar to those employed by Dr Rhine.\nExperiments have been made in both Pure Clairvoyance and Un-\ndifferentiated Telepathy.\nSpecial precautions have been taken to ehminate various sources\nof error, which may have afi'ected certain of Dr Rhine's results. For\ninstance the possibihty of the subject's \" learning \" the cards from\nslight marks on their backs has been entirely avoided by making the\nsubject work through a thousand different cards in succession in the\nclairvoyance tests ; in addition each card before being exposed\n\"\nwas covered by a rectangle of white cardboard. In the telepathic\nseries the guesser was separated from the agent and experimenter by\na wooden screen measuring three feet by three and fixed over the\ncentre of the table. A board fixed beneath the table prevented the\nsubj ect from obtaining any view of the agent's feet or legs.\nA most important innovation from the theoretical standpoint has\nbeen the substitution of a random sequence of cards in place of the\npacks used by Dr Rhine which contained exactly five cards of each\nsymbol. This random distribution was based upon a sequence of\n\f56 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1937\nrandom numbers obtained from a table of seven-figure logarithms\nand it is believed that by its use many statistical difficulties are\nobviated. Care has been taken that the subject or guesser should see\nnothing of the process of checking or the actual card sequences that\nhave appeared.\nWith the exception of about 800 guesses the whole of the 70,000\nexperiments have been witnessed and checked by a second person\nbesides myself. In the clairvoyance tests a duplicate record has\nbeen kept by this witness and in both the telepathic and clairvoyant\nexperiments duplicate record sheets signed by both witness and\nexperimenter have been posted by the witness to Dr Joad at the\nclose of each afternoon's work, in envelopes sealed in the presence of\nthe witness and myself. In the telepathic series the agent or\ntransmitter has also assmned the duties of witness and checker.\nEach subject has been allowed to work with several different\nagents.\nThroughout the experiments we have endeavoured to cultivate an\natmosphere of enthusiasm and of optimism as to the favourable out-\ncome of the work. Encouragement has been given for any apparent\nsuccesses and to provide an emotional stimulus considerable money\nprizes have been offered for persons able to score 12 or more suc-\ncesses in 25 consecutive guesses. Dr Rhine in his correspondence\nwith me approves in principle of these awards. We have also\nexperimented with pairs of agents and percipients between whom\na strong emotional link existed but so far such experiments have not\nbeen successful. A few well-known trance mediums and automatic\nwriters have been tested but without success. Whenever a subject\nhas suggested that he or she would be able to work better at home\nI have where possible visited the subject's home and tried the\nexperiments there, being careful to maintain the same rigid condi-\ntions of experimental control which throughout our work have never\nbeen relaxed.\nPersons of many nationahties have been tested including English,\nGermans, Greeks, Indians and Egyptians. After many hundreds of\nhours of patient work a few inferences and convictions begin to\nemerge. It does not seem probable that Dr Rhine's techniques\n%vill afford so easy a means of demonstrating telepathy and clair-\nvoyance in the psychological laboratory as might have been inferred\nfrom a perusal of his book \" Extra-Sensory Perception \". In the\ncase of a considerable percentage of our 93 subjects the examination\nhas been by no means superficial since many subjects have carried\nout more than 2000 guesses each. Yet we have not discovered\nmore than three or four persons whose scores were sufficiently\n\fApkil 1937 Bepetition of Dr J. B. Bhine's Work 57\nremarkable to warrant further examination. The most interesting\nof these was a lady living at Eichmond who scored 238 successes at\nundifferentiated telepathy in a series of 1000 guesses. Two different\nagents were employed, the subject scoring about equally well with\neach. The experiments took place in the percipient's home and are\nstill in progress. Another lady in a clairvoyance series obtained\ntwo scores of 11 and one of 13 in a sequence of 10 consecutive sets\nof 25 guesses but although she continued with the experiments until\nshe had completed 3000 guesses she achieved nothing of farther\ninterest. Another subject at University College has produced a\nremarkable run of \" low \" scoring, obtaining only 46 successes in a\nsequence of 350 guesses in undifferentiated telepathy including two\nsets of 25 with zero score. This case is being investigated further.^\nWhether such results as these represent flashes of extra-sensory per-\nception or are merely the high peaks which chance throws up above\nthe general level of mediocrity will only be settled by a more\nintensive examination of the individuals who produce such\n\" sports \".\nAs regards \" mass \"\"\nresults two interesting effects are worthy of\nnote although neither is sufficiently marked yet to afford basis for\nany conclusions. In the clairvoyance series carried out under perfect\nconditions of control there appears to be a certain tendency for a\nnumber of individuals to score below chance expectation ; this\neffect if confirmed by further work would lend some support to\nDr Rhine's claim for the existence of a \" negative \" type of extra-\nsensory perception.\nThe second effect appears only in the telepathic series and consists\nof a more or less general tendency to score runs of five or more\nsuccesses in unbroken sequence considerably in excess of what chance\nwould predict. One subject scored three such runs of five in 1000\nguesses. If this effect should be confirmed by further research it\nwould suggest that for most people telepathy\u2014if it occurs at all\n\u2014\ntakes place in very brief flashes, possibly as Mr Tyrrell suggests, in\nmoments of mental distraction. The small experience we have had\nwith subjects in trance and hypnosis however does seem to suggest\nthat not all states of mental dissociation necessarily favour the\nemergence of the telepathic impulse ; we have not so far found that\npersons in hypnosis or self-induced trance produce noticeably superior\nscores to those obtained in a normal state.\nThe possibilities of leakage by involuntary whispering in the\n1 At the time of writing this subject has scored only 168 successes in 1000\nguesses as against a chance expectation of 200.\n\f58 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1937\ntelepathic series (where the distance between agent and subject was\nabout five feet) has not yet been investigated but it is hoped that the\nexperiments of Mr R. B. Pillai in subhminal auditory perception\nnow in progress in the Psychological department will be invaluable\nto us in this connection.\nA fairly complete statistical analysis has been made of the first\n50,000 guesses and I shall be pleased to loan a copy of the tables\nto any student of the subject who is interested.\nIn conclusion, I would wish to emphasise that although the ex-\nperiments have been so far largely (though not entirely) productive\nof negative results they cannot be considered as invalidating in any\nway Dr Rhine's own work. Genuine telepathic percipients are\nprobably rather rare and the discovery of one or more such persons\nin a group of 90 individuals may be largely a matter of good or bad\nluck. Women who exceed six feet in height are also rather rare and\none might select a random batch of 90 women and find that it did\nnot contain a single specimen. But it would be absurd to draw any\nconclusions as to the non-existence of very tall women upon such a\nlimited survey.\nIt is to be hoped that many other competent workers will be in-\nduced to carry out similar repetitions of Dr Rhine's work so that a\nfar more extensive survey of this very interesting field of human\nfaculty may be available.\nINSTANCES OF APPARENT CLAIRVOYANCE\nMr C. V. C. Herbert, the sitter, feels that the following extracts\nfrom sittings with Miss Jacqueline and Miss Campbell contain\ndescriptions which seem to apply to the same house. In sending\nthe extracts he remarks that they are the best instances of apparent\nclairvoyance of which he has had personal experience and that he\ncannot explain them by any normal hypothesis.\nExtracts from shorthand notes of a sitting with Miss Jacqueline\nheld on April 3 1935, at the British College of Psychic\nScience.\nSitter : C.

V. C. Herbert.\nNote.\u2014So far as is known, the sitter was anon}Tnous to Miss\nCampbell ; the sitting was arranged through the Eev. C. Drayton\nThomas.\nRecord of sitting\nSubject : There is a property\nin a hilly district. The house is\npainted white or made of white\nmaterial. The garden was orig-\ninally very elaborate, but is not\nso now. There is a field or\nground which originally formed\npart of the property, but which\nhas now been disposed of. Now\nthere is only the house and\ngarden. Some people are anx-\nious to sell the house. They\nought to do so. It is important\nthat it should be sold ;\npossibly\nowing to the difficulty of getting\nto the place. One has to go over\nthe water. If they took more\ntrouble, they would be more\nlikely to sell it.\nNot far from the house is a\nchurch. There are two people\nwho were connected with the\nhouse who are connected with\nthe church. There was a man\nconnected with the house for\nwhom I get the initial W.\nSitter : No, I cannot get\nthat. Not W.\nSubject : William, I get\nWilham.\nSitter : Yes, that is right. I\nremember now.\nNotes by sitter\nMy sister, Mrs Trefusis, has a\nhouse and garden near Ajaccio\nin Corsica. She is anxious to sell\nit. The house is made of white\nstone and cement. The country\nround is very hilly. The garden\nwas at one time very elaborate,\nand was the show place of the\ndistrict. The property was orig-\ninally much larger, but now con-\nsists only of the house and\ngarden. My sister, though anx-\nious to sell, has not taken any\nvery active steps for the dis-\nposal of the house. One of the\nprincipal disadvantages of the\nproperty for an Enghsh person\nis the tiresome sea journey from\nthe mainland to Corsica.\nThere is an English church in\nAjaccio, about two miles from\nthe house. The widow of the\noriginal builder of the house and\nher daughter live in the presby-\ntery of the Church and look after\nit. My sister bought the house\nfrom General Sir William Mann-\ning.\n\f62 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1937\nREVIEW\nThe Med.iumshipofMaria Silhert. ByAdalbert Evian. Translated by\nH.E.Kennedy. (Rider and Co., London. 1936.) Pricel0s.6d.net.\nOn August 30, 1936, there died in Austria one of the most in-\nteresting of the Continental mediums, Maria Silbert, of Graz, who\nwas famous not only in her own country but also in England where\nshe had created a great impression.\nThis volume is by one of her most devoted Austrian disciples, who\nhas clearly had unequalled opportunities for observing her pheno-\nmena. As a work of scientific interest it is worthless, but as illus-\ntrating the minds of those over whom Frau Silbert cast her influence\nit is by no means without value. For whatever may be said in her\nfavour or against her it can scarcely be denied that she had the\npower of making the majority of her sitters act, in the words of the\nlate Dr Prince, like unsophisticated children. Indeed it may be said\nthat the profound contempt that she had for her investigators was,\npartly at least, the secret of her power. In the majority of cases her\nattitude convinced them of her sincerity : in others it broke her\nspell. Once convinced, the convert will believe almost anything.\nTo see learned men of academic distinction sit round the table with\nFrau Silbert in full light and to hear their delighted cries when\nthe old lady kicked their legs was a sight not willingly forgotten.\nIt was a key which opened the door to much which was obscure. It\nrevealed states of mind rarely seen outside the seance room.\nIt must not be thought, however, that Frau Silbert contented\nherself with this nonsense. It was not on this basis that her fame\nrested. When away from home she showed her powers to a degree\nin certain directions which was not common in her own circle.\nThis was due to the fact that she knew that she had to gain her\nconverts by showing them wonders which they could not explain\nhowever hard they tried. Once they were converted then she knew\nthat she could rest from her labours and, beaming at them, kick\ntheir legs in full light under the table and be greeted with the same\necstatic cries of pleasure as those which were given when her more\nstartUng feats were performed. For it must be admitted that the\nphenomena of Frau Silbert, when she was at her best, were very\nremarkable. Not only had she mastered the art of misdirection to\nan unusual degree, but she combined it with a skill and a dexterity\nin manipulation which at times were indeed noteworthy. Coupled\nwith these gifts she exhibited a pleasing and motherly personality\nwith a winning smile and the general appearance of a benign old\nlady, smiling upon her sitters, and herself astonished at the occur-\nrences around her. Although it is now known how the majority of\n\fApril 1937 Review 63\nher phenomena were produced, the modus operandi of some of her\neffects has never been pubhshed and indeed had better remain un-\nknown lest others learn it. In certain respects some of her methods\nwere the most brilliant examples of misdirection coupled with ex-\ntreme dexterity that I have ever seen ; and it was curious to see how\noften she would lapse into crude bungling when she thought that the\nsitters would not be able to notice any difference.\nIt is only by bearing these facts in mind that we can understand\nthe growth of that legendary figure which this book reveals. Around\nher clustered tales of marvel which might be imagined purely fiction-\nal if we had not met those in the flesh who beheved them in their\nentirety. Many of the phenomena recorded by Herr Evian may be\ncompared with those narrated of D. D. Home. Thus on one occasion\nthe author of this book saw Frau Silbert pass through a solid wooden\ndoor : on another occasion, during a drive in an automobile, he\nrecords the fact that the mediumship of the old lady supplied the\nmotive power for the vehicle, which travelled over long stretches of\nroad and often up steep hills without the aid of the engine. Again,\none day twenty-five pairs of shoes walked round the seance room by\nthemselves in red light ; and on another occasion the seance table\nwas smashed to pieces and a hundred photographic negatives in the\ntable drawer were broken, the glass being strewn about the floor.\nNext day, however, the table was as sound as ever and all the plates\nwere again whole and arranged in the drawer. Frau Silbert's\nmediumship had been working in the night. Similarly we are in-\nformed that when in London the medium was placed in a sack, and\nfastened with electric handcuffs ; and at one sitting had three\nNobel prize winners as sitters. It is unfortunate that the authorities\nat the institution where all this is alleged to have happened write to\nme stating that they were unaware of these things.\nIt would be wrong to throw down this book as a romance or a\ncollection of fabrications. Maybe it is both but it is more than that.\nIt is a picture of the beUever's mind. In Frau Silbert were com-\nbined imusual powers, and it is not surprising that there are many\npersons ahve today who continue to beheve that her phenomena\nwere supernormal. Like most really first-class tricks they were\ninexpHcable to all not fully trained to understand such things.\nIndeed I know conjurers who saw her and were completely baffled\nby some of the things they saw. Her work was not in their line. It\nwas a thing by itself, and it was a beautiful thing to watch once the\nsecrets were known. It was only when the method was understood\nthat the artistry of Frau Silbert became apparent. Had she not\nregarded her sitters with so much disdain it is possible that she\n\f64 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Apeil 1937\nmight have succeeded to a greater extent than she did. For they\nwere not all like Herr Evian. To him we must at least be grateful\nfor this volume. As a modern example of what belief in the occult\ncan do for the modern mind it is valuable. For an understanding of\nFrau Silbert it is important, and it is to be hoped that those who\nstill believe in the genuineness of her phenomena will take heed.

Godwin Baynes\nIt would be not only reckless but unprofitable to embark upon a\ndiscussion of the spirit-world without first circumscribing the\nterrain. As a physician approaching the field from the side of\nmedical psychology I find, however, a piece of ground already\ncleared. But this claim docs not correspond altogether with that\nof psychical research. Our psychological investigations have\nunwittingly quickened an interest in ghosts, because these play a\nsymbolical role in the subliminal dramas with which the psycho-\ntherapist has to deal. Psychical research, on the other hand, tends\nto pursue its interest in the ghost as an independent phenomenon,\nexisting in and for itself ; its relativity in the scheme of general\npsychic causahty being a secondary consideration, if not ignored\naltogether.\nThe psycho-therapist encounters certain psycho-neurotic states\nwhich, by their very nature, compel him to make use of the primitive\nconcept of possession. These ghost-effects are very real. A\npsycho-neurotic personality often behaves as though an ahen will\n1 This Paper was read by Dr. H. Godwin Baynes at a Private Meeting of\nthe Society on 25th November 1936. Hon. Ed.\n\fMay 1937 The Ghost as a Psychic Phenomenon 67\n-possessed him. He also has dreams in which a ghost appears in his\nroom, or in which he is being pm'sued by a sinister demonic figure\nwhom he cannot evade. But, although the effect is alien in char-\nacter, its causation is intelligible, and the conditions of its appearance\nare sometimes predictable.\nWe have the advantage, therefore, of being able to study the\nnatural history of the ghost from an inside position. Whereas the\nscientific investigator, who has to sift the accounts of a number of\nexcited witnesses who may or may not have hallucinated apparitions\nor strange noises, is in a different case. For he must needs deter-\nmine how much or how little should be ascribed to general suggesti-\nbility, how much of the experience has been unconsciously trimmed\nto suit the supposed expectations of the investigator, and even, where\na relatively convincing consensus gentium exists, he has to determine\nwhere a fine can be drawn between the subjective constellation in\nthe witnesses' psychology and the unknown factor which can be\nregarded as an external activating force. In these cases the psychi-\ncal context, by virtue of which the ghostly appearance would fit into\na relatively intelligible sequence of events, is usually lacking and,\ntherefore, the apparition is left suspended, as it were, in a super- or\nsub-normal unreality.\nThe question of setting, or frame, or context, is the primary con-\nsideration in the understanding of all psychic phenomena. In the\nfield of natural science we are accustomed to draw certain logical\nconclusions from the objective aspect and behaviour of the things\nobserved, since natural science proceeds on the assumption that\nnature is rational. But as soon as we cross over into the field of\nso-called psychic phenomena, a purely objective account of the\nphenomena is found to be inadequate. For example, an objective\nrecord of Saul's critical journey to Damascus including the subject's\naccount of the divine apparition in heaven and his subsequent\nchange in character and attitude, savours of the miraculous only\nbecause the full subjective context is lacking. If this be added,\nwe can get a glimpse of that split-off subliminal personality which\nwas gradually assimilating the Christian spirit, the while the con-\nscious personality Saul was fanatically over-compensating his own\ndoubt by drastic persecution of the Christians. We might be able\nto detect certain signs, as the nascent Christian complex waxed in\npower in the unconscious subjective hinterland, until it finally\nbroke through the threshold of consciousness, throwing Saul to the\nground and declaring its superior energy-content by its apparitional\nmanifestation in an aura of white light. From now onwards the\nprevious conscious personahty and standpoint is repressed as an\n\f68 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1937\nunworthy antithesis to the victorious Christian thesis, finding only\na spasmodic pathological expression in the guise of epileptiform fits.\nThe very fact that we are able to make this fairly intelligible\nreconstruction of what seemed to our forefathers a miraculous\noccurrence does not mean that we have, thereby, explained the\noverwhelming impression of a genuine rehgious experience. But it\ndoes mean that we are able to rescue a large tract of human ex-\nperience from the realm of magic and mystery, and to bring it\nwithin the province of understanding. Instead of viewing an\nisolated disjuncted marvel in the skies, we are able to piece together\nan orderly sequence of events which reveals an inherent purposive-\nness. This has been made possible by carrying the agnostic spirit\nof scientific enquiry into the realm of psychic events.\nIn psychological practice we frequently encounter facts that seem\nscarcely credible ; facts that appear at first so irrational that we\nalmost despair of embracing them in a scientific corpus. But in\nso far as the hving individual, who alone is able to provide the\npsychic context of these strange events, is sitting solidly before us,\nthe lamp of reason refuses to be extinguished, and with it we are\nsometimes enabled to find the rational thread of continuity. The\nhypothesis which has supplied the golden thread in the labyrinth\nof the psyche is the conception that all psychic activity is pur-\nposive. This golden thread of purposive activity is, however,\nrarely supplied by the patient's conscious account of his experience.\nThe clue is usually found in his dreams or fantasies. These spon-\ntaneous products of the mind reveal the unconscious causal nexus\nwhich makes the conscious history intelligible.\nThe unconscious is merely a term which comprises everything\nthat exists, that has existed, or that could exist beyond the range\nof this individual consciousness. It is therefore a relative condition,\nsince what is unconscious to-day may be conscious to-morrow, and\nvice versa. So long as consciousness in the early days of last centiiry\nwas limited, for example, l^y the concept of miraculous or divine\ncreation, the continuity of the evolutionary process was an un-\nconscious content, but it was none the less a fact. And in so far as\ngeneral consciousness to-day still regards the mental process as\nsynonymous with consciousness, it must necessarily regard every\nprojection of unconscious psychic activity as aspects of objective\nreality. For if the continuity between the emergent form and its\nantecedent germination in the unconscious is not perceived by\nconsciousness, it is held not to exist. And when this continuity is\ndemonstrated, it frequently happens that the individual concerned\nfeels that in some way his faith has been undermined. Very few\n\fMay 1937 The Ghost as a Psychic Phenomenon 69\ncan tolerate the truth that what is attributed to fate represents\nthe sum of unconscious psychic motivations, and that the all-\nembracing paternal image is a condensation of inherited experience.\nI beUeve everyone resents these psychological explanations, because\nin the West the concept of the psyche has been cheapened by a x^hole\nhost of opinion-pedlars and wisdom-mongers who offer cheap ex-\nplanations with the air of a scientific pandit. A cheap explanation\nexplains things away, whereas our best scientific theory merely\nremoves one veil from the muffled figure of truth. We use the term\npsyche as though the name gave us power over the thing named.\nBut in fact we cannot even locate the psyche, while its contents and\nactivities are, to a large extent, unknown to us and beyond our\nconscious control. When science invades the province that hitherto\nhas been guarded by rehgious taboo it has to tread warily ; for it is\nsacred ground.\nIn certain eastern countries, or amongst savage peoples, the voices\nof the insane are regarded as the utterances of a spirit, and arouse\nveneration and awe. Whereas with us, who know that the state of\ninsanity means to be in the grip of irrational ideas, no heed is given\nto what issues from the mouths of the possessed ; unless one happens\nto be a Dostoievsky or a Jung.\nPsychological explanation then is a scientific attempt to make\nthe sequence of psychic events intelhgible. But a purely rational\naccount is never satisfactory because the nature of unconscious\nactivity is primitive and therefore non-rational in character. Our\nbest hope, then, is to make use of the non-rational symbol-language\nof the unconscious, even though a symbol can never be completely\ntransposed into intellectual terms. Our experience of our underlying\nprimitive psychology consists at times of ghosts, and demons and\nother mythological denizens. During the experience these things\nare our reality. Hence our conscious reaction to these experiences\nmust take into account the non-rational, dynamic character of the\npure experience. And yet, because the ruler of consciousness is the\nreason, our account must also be essentially reasonable. Our worst\ndanger is to use our scientific intellect as a defence against the\nexperience of the primordial unconscious. Science is knowledge,\nand to experience ourselves must involve a certain responsibihty\nconcerning the knowledge we have gained. If I know, for instance,\nthat certain so-called accidents which befall me, or certain bad\neffects I see in my children, or my household have their source in\nmy unconscious psychology, I must choose between making my\nchildren my scapegoats or taking responsibihty for my own psycho-\nlogy. I cannot any longer assume that I don't know.\n\f70 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1937\nNow, this is the situation in which the problem of the ghost has-\nplaced us. There is not one of us who is free of responsibiUty\nconcerning the ghosts of the past. We imagine we have bought'\noff fate by our superior education, but actually we are haunted by\nbewildered and dissatisfied spirits. Ancestor-worship is to be\nfoimd wherever culture has spread. Gifts and food and funerary\nrites, as are to be seen in China to-day, did not spring solely out of\nveneration for the honoured dead. Originally they were the means,\nof satisfying the ghosts, in order that they should not afflict the\nliving with their ghostly craving for life. When Dr Jung and I\nwere camping among the Elgonyi on Mount Elgon, we frequently\ncame across little ghost-houses by the side of the path leading to a\nhouse or village. The Httle houses had two or more rooms, and\nmilk and corn and other attractions were placed in them, so that\nthe spirits might stay there and not go on to the village and make\npeople sick. The ghosts of dead relatives and ancestors are par-\nticularly to be feared as the cause of illness. The most difficult and\nresponsible office of the shaman among Siberian tribes, or of the\nlaibon in East Africa, is hterally the cure of souls. Heahng the sick\nis considered to be a relatively elementary art. Shamans of the\nlower grades can undertake doctoring, but only the highest grade\nof shaman can shepherd the souls of the dead. In Lamaism also\nthe ultimate store of traditional wisdom is reserved for instructing\nthe dead. The spirits have to be enticed, or led away from the\nhabitations of the living to the place where they can dwell in safety.\nIn Uganda we were allowed to see one of these houses, to which the\nghosts are led. They are really churches. Often a considerable\namount of art and devotion has been given to these ghost-houses\nwhere the spirits of the ancestors are housed. The churches of\nour English shires, standing in consecrated ground among the\ngraves of the dead, are really ghost-houses.\nFrom this point of view God would be the great ancestor-spirit\nwho must be very securely housed, lest He should wander into the\nvillage and make people mad or sick. The act of consecration is a\nmagical ritual designed to set apart this special plot of ground in\nwhich the ghosts of the dead are magically contained. We have\nlost sight of the original psychological necessity which set apart the\nGottesacker with its graves and spirit-house as a piece of consecrated\nground ; but comj)arison with the primitive homologue shows us\nthat in spite of our ideal superstructure, the groimd-plan of our\ncivilized religious structure is identical with the primitive conception.\nMr John Layard tells me that in Malekula, an island of the New\nHebrides, the most pressing need in every person's hfe is to have a.\n\fMay 1937 The Ghost as a Psychic Phenomenon 71\npig or pigs which, in the event of death, can be sacrificed to placate\nthe bad female ghost Lehevhev, so that the soul may travel safely\nto the volcano where the ancestor-spirits dwell. At the end of the\ngreat Sumerian epic, Gilgamish, we find the closing stanzas con-\ncerned with the description of the ghosts fomid in the underworld\nby Enkidu's spirit, and how their fate is determined by the way they\ndied and the way in which they are remembered by their survivmg\nrelatives.\nJust as good manners consist in bearing in mind the shadow of the\nliving, as, for instance, face-saving in China, or in Africa, the careful\navoidance of a man's shadow, and here at home, the instinctive\nconsideration for the complexes of one's friends ;\nso piety consists\nin taking care of the ghosts. Many primitive people will never\nchastise their children because the child is inhabited by an ancestor-\nspirit. Similarly a snake that comes into a house is protected and\nfed, because it contains an ancestor-spirit. The care of sacred\nanimals, as, for instance, the sacred cows and apes of India, the\ntotem animal, or the creature who becomes your tinihowi, ]! you\nare an Achumawi Indian\u2014all these pious exercises are mspired by\nveneration for the spirits.\nNearly all peoples in whom ghost-psychology plays a vital role\ndiscriminate between bad ghosts who seduce or, in some way,\nahenate the living from their proper way (often they are vampires\nand were-wolves), and the good spirits who want to be reborn, or\nto participate positively in life. I remember a paranoid case of\ndementia praecox who three times attempted her own life. After\nleaping from the top of a house, she told me that her mother and\nher lover were calhng her to join them in the spirit-land, and that\nher leap was done in pure ecstasy. On one occasion during the\nEaster Passion-week she attempted her life because Our Lord was\ncalling her to join Him. At other times He spoke to her out of\n\\ heaven, revealing to her the iimer nature of the universe, a kind of\nsecret doctrine which she had to teach to all who could Hsten with\ntheir hearts. Thus, in this woman's experience, Christ was at one\ntime a bad ghost seducing her to suicide, at another He was a\ncelestial source of illumination and guidance ;\nin other words, a\nguardian spirit.\nLuther had this same ambiguous conception of God. He said\nthan when God was in the heavens He was all majesty and power ;\nthe God of our ideals. But sometimes He absconded and in a\nconcealed form drove men mad or compelled them to every kind of\nirrationality. He called this nether aspect of God the deus ah-\nsconditus. _\n\u2022\n\f72 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1937\nThe Chinese also make a distinction between the shen soul and the\nhwei soul. The character for shen means to expand, to rise up.\nIt is the divine substance which rises up and leads to deliverance.\nThe hwei is daemonic, compulsive, and chngs to the concrete and\nearthy. The meaning of kwei is ghost-being. In Egypt the\nka-soul was the double or shadow, and tended to chng to the\nmaterial body.\nThis ambivalency also appears in the primitive attitude to spirits.\nIt is illustrated very beautifully in an account of a Siberian shaman,\ngiven by Leo Sternberg, the Russian anthropologist, in a paper on\nDivine Election in Primitive Religion. He was impressed by the\nfact that behind all the favourable or unfavourable events in a\nprimitive man's life the activities of good or bad spirits are always\npresupposed. As an example, he cites the case of a young shaman\nof the Gold tribe whose sincerity attracted him. He records this\nman's life-history as follows :\n\" My ancestors lived in the village of Urmil (15 versts from\nChabarovsk). Their gens is said to have migrated there from the\nlower reaches of the Amur. Long, long ago, we were Ainu. The\nold folks say that some generations back there were three great\nshamans of my gens. No shamans were known amongst my\nnearest forefathers. My father and mother enjoyed perfect health.\nI am now forty years old. I am married, but have no children.\nUp to the age of twenty I was quite well. Then I fell ill, my whole\nbody ailed me, I had bad headaches. Shamans tried to cure me,\nbut it was all of no avail. When I began shamaning myself, I got\nbetter and better. It is now ten years that I have been a shaman,\nbut at first I used to practise for myself only, and it is three years\nago only that I took to curing other people. A shaman's practice\nis very, very fatiguing, it is much harder than felling trees, but there\nis nothing to be done about that.\n\" Once I was asleep on my sick-bed, when a spirit approached\nme. It was a very beautiful woman. Her figure was very slight,\nshe was no more than half an arshin (71 cm.) tall. Her face and\nattire were quite as those of one of our Gold women. Her hair\nfell down to her shoulders in short black tresses. Other shamans\nsay they have had the vision of a woman with one-half of her face\nblack, and the other half red. She said :\n'\nI am the \" ayami \" of\nyour ancestors, the Shamans. I taught them shamaning. Now\nI am going to teach you. The old shamans have died off, and there\nis no one to heal people. You are to become a shaman.'\n\" Next she said :\n'\nI love you, I have no husband now, you wiU\nbe my husband and I shall be a wife unto you. I shall give you\n\fMay 1937 The Ghost as a Psychic Phenomown 73\nassistant spirits. You are to heal with their aid, and I shall teach\nand help you myself. Food will come to us from the people.'\n\" I felt dismayed and tried to resist. Then she said :\n'\nIf you\nwill not obey me, so much the worse for you. I shall kill you.'\n\" She has been coming to me ever since, and I sleep with her as\nwith my own wife, but we have no children. She lives quite by\nherself without any relatives in a hut on a mountain, but she often\nchanges her abode. Sometimes she comes under the aspect of an\nold woman, and sometimes as a winged tiger. I mount her and she\ntakes me to show me different countries. I have seen mountains,\nwhere only old men and women live, and villages, where you see\nnothing but young people, men and women : they look like Golds\nand speak Goldish, sometimes those people are turned into tigers.\nNow my ayami does not come to me as frequently as before. For-\nmerly, when teaching me, she used to come every night. She has\ngiven me three assistants\u2014the '\njarga '\n(panther), the '\ndoonto\n'\n(the bear), and the '\namba '\n(the tiger). They come to me in my\ndreams, and appear whenever I summon them while shamaning.\nIf one of them refuses to come, the ayami makes them obey, but,\nthey say, there are some who do not obey even the '\nayami '. When\nI am shamaning, the '\nayami ' and the assistant spirits are possessing\nme : whether big or small, they penetrate me, as smoke or vapour\nwould. When the '\nayami '\nis within me, it is she who speaks\nthrough my mouth, and she does everything herself.\"\nThis, as you see, is an interesting case because it is an uncon-\ntaminated psychological record of the conversion of a daemonic, ob-\nsessing ghost into a helpful, guiding spirit. Furthermore, it supports\nour idea that the possessing-ghost is a manifestation of the famihal\nor racial imconscious. In general, there are two distinct causes of\nsickness among so-called primitive peoples. The one is the loss\nor absence of a soul, the other is possession by an alien spirit. In\nthe former case a man feels he has lost something which is normally\nhis : virtue has gone out of him. In the latter he is invaded by\nsome influence or power which has estranged him from his normal\nbeing. Something, in fact, has got into him.\nFrom this point of view the soul in the former case represents a\ncertain quantum of vital energy which receded out of consciousness\ninto the personal subconscious, where it was no longer immediately\navailable.\nThe concept of spirit or ghost, on the contrary, always represents\neither a welcome or an unwelcome intrusion. The Holy Ghost and\nthe hierarchy of angels and archangels on the one side and Satan\nthe Evil Spirit with all his fascisti on the other, are highly elaborated\n\f74 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 193T\nconceptions of universal psychic factors which appear under ana-\nlogous forms in every human society.\nIn every-day psycho-therapeutic practice we encounter precisely\nsimilar conditions to those described above ;\nnamely, losing a soul\nor being invaded by a spirit. A patient, for instance, complains\nthat her interest in her work and in her friends has disappeared.\nHer voice has no resonance, her narration of the events of her life\nis a dull monotone, her face is expressionless and her outlook is\nthat of an imprisoned victim. She is afflicted by a profound sense\nof inferiority which constantly insinuates that she has no right to\nburden me or anyone else with her misery. When we look at her\ndream-life we find a copious activity in the unconscious which flows\nalong entirely independent of consciousness. Consciously she finds\nno interest or meaning in her dreams, but she records them dutifully.\nFrom her dreams it is quite clear what has happened to her. She\nis the daughter of a policeman and was brought up on the supposition\nthat what was reqviired of her was to behave in a certain way. Value\nwas not given to her as a unique individuahty, but only in so far as-\nher behaviour conformed to collective requirements. In fact, she\nwas not loved, but merely drilled. She had a good intelligence, and\nwith it she was able to gain a certain independent position, but only\nas an intellectual machine in scientific institutions.\nThis way of life offered no possibihty at all for her emotional and\ninstinctual needs. Therefore her soul flew away. In other words,,\nthe flow of instinctive energy receded into the xmconscious and left\nher bereft hke a marooned mariner on a desert island. This patient\ndreamed that her blood was being sucked by a vampire ghost. The\nsoul that flies away is apt to become a renegade.\nThis case is an example of a great class of disabled individuals.\nThe sense of insufficiency or inferiority (what is termed the in-\nferiority-complex) is, according to our experience, always due to the\nfact that an essential function has dropped away, or has been left\ndormant in the personal subconscious. It is a part of the personahty\nwhich needs to be hved and, therefore, its absence from consciousness\nis felt as a crippling loss.\nWith such cases the therapeutic aim is to recover the lost function,,\nfirst by a thorough-going recognition of the actual condition, and\nthen by a work of assimilation or reintegration of the absent function\ninto the conscious personality. An attitude of acceptance of the\nunconscious is the primary necessity in these cases.\nWith the other type of case we find that the normal, healthy\npersonahty has become infected by an archaic, daemonic and highly\nirrational complex which is hable suddenly to invade consciousness.\n\fMay 1937 The Ghost as a Psychic Phenomenon 75\nin the form of an obsessional idea or craving, sometimes in out-\nbreaks of explosive violence which have apparently no rational\ncause. The elfect of these irruptions is to ahenate the personalitjr\nto such an extent that the whole expression undergoes a change.\nOne can tell in an instant, whether the real personahty is present, or\nthe invading one. With these cases the mental disturbance alfects\nother people in the milieu and, in the worst cases, may even tyrannize\nlike the evil spirit which from time to time inhabited King Saul, or\nlike the demon Asmodeus who possessed Sara.\nJung demonstrated, in his researches in the field of Dementia\nPraecox, that this phenomenon of possession was due to the spas-\nmodic activation of an autonomous complex. He also showed that\nthe hallucinatory projections and the unbridled force of the complex\nwere due to its pathological independence from the normal self-\nregulating coordination of the psychic contents. As soon as the\ncomplex can be pierced by the full rays of conscious insight, it\ngradually assumes a relative character and loses its daemonic power.\nOccasionally a spht-off function assumes a relative autonomy,\nthus borrowing the character of a famihar spirit without pathological\nconsequences. The daimon of Socrates would be such a case, in\nwhich the intuitive function takes on a kind of separate activity in\nthe marginal region of the mind.\nIn certain hysterical patients, where there is a one-sided and\nabnormal activity of the sympathetic system, and a correspondingly\ndefective conscious fmiction, the surplus of energy is liable to\nexplode or spill over in a quite irrational way. In such cases it is\nby no means uncommon for objects in the immediate environment\nto be broken, or a certain animal in the patient's neighbourhood to\nbegin to behave in an erratic symptomatic fashion.\nIt seems to me probable that this externahzing of vital energy in\nhysterical patients is of the same order as the various manifestations\nof aberrant energy in mediumistic seances. They are equally devoid\nof purpose or psychical content, and their sole interest rests upon the\nfact that energy, which is normally organized in a psychological\nsystem, suddenly assumes an erratic behaviour in the objective\nfield. From the psychological standpoint this spiUing over of\npsychic energy on an infra-psychic level must be regarded as\npathological and also, in a sense, as rather tiresome. One soon\nwearies of stunts which, at bottom, have no aim or purpose other\nthan challenging one's creduhty. In saying this I do not, of course,\ninclude the genuine psychic experiments that have been seriously\nconducted for a number of years, and the results of which have\nserved to expand our conception of psychic possibilities in a very\n\f76 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1937\nlemarkable way. But everyone will, I think, agree that in the\nrealm of so-called psychic phenomena, there is a considerable portion\nTvhich belongs properly to the province of physics. In all pro-\nbability these manifestations of erratic energy in mediumistic\nseances will eventually be measured by physical instruments and\nthe whole atmosphere of the super-normal will depart from them.\nIf we leave this aspect of spiritistic experiments to be taken care of\nby the physicists, we come to those border-line phenomena which\nleally demand a thorough-going psychological investigation. This\nresearch should embrace all the dynamic psychological factors\npresent in the seance-group, particularly the origin of the main trend\nof interest by which the control of the evening has been constellated.\nIt has often been observed how the presence of a particular person-\nality in the group activates a sympathetic complex in the group\nimconscious.\nEvery avenue of psychological exploration should be exhausted\nbefore the alternative hypothesis of an extra-psychic presence can\nbe estabUshed.\nIn making these explorations we have to take into account two\nkinds of subjective ghost-complexes which are liable to become\nactivated in individual participants by the highly suggestible\natmosphere of the seance. The one is the complex of a specific\nbereavement in which the psychic energy that was invested in the\ndead person is held in the unconscious and therefore excluded from\nactive participation in life. This is the ghost-effect coming from\nthe past. The other is more difficult to explore, because it arises\nfrom a future potentiality that is not yet active in consciousness.\nAs a rule, we can only understand these manifestations by subse-\nquent observations of the life- interest of the persons forming the\ngroup.\nIt might be well to discuss the psychology of these ghost-com-\nplexes in more detail. What may be termed the psychological\nghost-effect appears in one form or another throughout civiUzed\npsychology. It is, in fact, an aspect of primary human experience\nfrom which the particular attributes of the legendary ghost are\nderived. The ghost-eifect is liable to appear under the following\nconditions :\n(fl.) When an essential instinctive relationship is severed by death.\nThe vital energy that was identified with the loved parent or child,\netc., no longer possesses the living object. By virtue of its energic\nmomentum this specific energy-content produces an image of the\nperson which may either be projected into space as an hallucination,\nor appear as a revenant in dreams or seances.\n\fMay 1937 The GJiost as a Psychic Phenomenon 77\n(6) In cases where the investment of vital energy is centred in aa\nunborn child and a miscarriage occiirs, the ghost-effect often takes\nthe form of profoimd and sometimes suicidal depression, occasionall}^\nwith auditory hallucinations and often there are characteristic\nghost-dreams.\n(c) When an essential function or phase of the individual hfe is\nignored or repressed, resulting in a characteristic attitude of resent-\nment or self-pity. In the dreams of such persons the excluded\nfunction frequently takes on the aspect of a pursuing or haunting\nghost.\nFrom this point of view every psychic element or function which,,\nby virtue of the vital energy it contains, demands to become\nincorporated in the complete personality, is liable to develop\ncertain sinister properties of the ghost when excluded from life.\nThe bitter, resentful moods of unfulfilled personaUties are due tO'\nthe taimtings of these psychological ghosts. The chronic bad\nconscience, the man with a chip on the shoulder, the person who-\nreviles his fate, etc., are typical examples of this condition.\nIn cases where a man has been prized away from his ancestral\nbackground, and attempts to live in total disregard of the qualities\nof his inherited psychology, it is usually ancestral figures that\nhaunt and accuse him in his dreams.\nWhat is termed a complex is, at bottom, a specific functional\npotentiahty, involving a certain quantity of energy under the tension\nof the opposites, yea or nay. In so far as this function has been\nrepressed it is a ghost seeking redress. In so far as it represents\na future potentiality of increasing life and consciousness it is a\nspirit seeking life. The one effect causes resentment, the other the\nbirth-pangs of creation. In so far as they are unconscious, both\ncan appear in the form of projections in the apparitional sphere,\nthe character of the projections differing according to the nature\nof the complex from which it springs.\nFrom these fragmentary examples it will be immediately clear\nwhy in every country and period the most mahgn ghost is that of\nthe man who took his hfe, or of the man whose life was violently\ncut short of its natural fulfilment. In that famous account by two\nEnglish ladies of the ghostly appearance of Marie Antoinette's court\nin the Trianon, we are instantly reminded of the fact that the people\nwho figured in those scenes met their death under the guillotine.\nBut although we can appreciate how the ghost-effects I have\ndescribed in the psychological sphere inevitably and logically result\nfrom an arbitrary intervention in the natural development of a vital\nprocess, in other words, a kind of partial suicide, we are no nearer\n\f78 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1937\nto an understanding of what constitutes the ghost as an objective\nor extra-psychic entity. In the one case our subjective under-\nstanding of the individual psychic history gives us the necessary\nclue. Whereas, the problem of the ghost as an independent entity\nbrings us face to face with an enigmatic psychic occurrence without\n-a subject to interrogate. As a psychologist I cannot conceive a\nmore extravagant situation. Give me a ghost who will stand and\nanswer Uke a man. What then ? you ask. Well, in that case we\nshall have a human document we can understand, instead of a\nsupernormal phenomenon.\nAt the word '\nsupernormal ' we can almost see the door of our\ninmost mind being opened by an unseen hand, and the dark indivi-\ndual problem, which underhes all our discussion of ghosts and\n-spirits, steals silently among us. Like the haunted sun-hero\nGilgamish, our mind at one time or another is liable to be invaded\nby the doubt :\n\" My brother is dead ; does he survive ? And if\nso, can I reach him ?\n\" In the presence of this all-too-human\npre-occupation, science can say very Uttle. With regard to the\n\u2022effective survival of the spirits of our dead within the psychic sphere\n\"there can be no doubt at all. There is abundant evidence on every\nside from living men and women that their lives are influenced,\nguided and, in a certain sense, controlled by persuasive or malign\nforces which they identify with the spirits of their loved dead.\nThere are abundant and, I believe, quite genuine communications,\nwhich contain descriptions and impart certain knowledge that has\nthe self-evident character of transubjective information.\nThe difficulty we have in drawing decisive conclusions from this\nevidence arises from the fact that, so far, we are quite unable to\ndefine the frontiers of what we rather naively term the unconscious.\nWe think of the psyche as a totahty embracing the whole subject.\nBut within this totaUty that complex we know as our personality\nis only a small fragmentary item. Beyond our personal psycho-\nlogical domain there extends a vast, indefinite psychic hinterland\nivhose contents are no more a part of our personal psychology than\nis the Tower of London or Stonehenge. Normally, we are like\ncaddis-worms, completely protected and covered in by the contem-\nporary factors of our personal life. At certain moments, however,\nTve stumble unwittingly into this impersonal, transubjective dimen-\nsion and we then experience the events of that realm in an immediate\nobjective sense. When a man has experienced this realm of the\n\u2022collective unconscious he knows he has been beyond the normal\nframework of our three-dimensional reahty. He can never express\n-or communicate his experience in ordinary language. Like William\n\fMay 1937 The Ghost as a Psychic Phenomenon 79\nBlake, or Melville, or Goya, lie feels isolated and somewhat alienated\nfrom Ms contemporaries. His attempts to express his experience\nare usually highly symboUcal, and the irrationality of his creations\n\u2022often raises the suspicion of insanity. In the middle ages the\nexperience of the collective unconscious took on the pecuHar\nsymbohsm of alchemy or of some mystical quest, as in the Quest\nof the Holy Grail. In the East this whole dimension of spiritual\nexperience has long been explored and highly elaborated in the\nTantric and other forms of yoga.\nThe Umits of this primordial ocean cannot be set. All we can\ninow of this realm is by the empirical way of experience, and\nnaturally the accounts of subjective experience are subject, to some\nextent, to individual psychological constellations.\nThere is no doubt that our hves are conditioned far more deeply\n\"by the events of the impersonal psyche than from purely personal\nsources. It is, in fact, the primordial oceanic basis upon which our\nlittle personal craft ply their ceaseless activity. What we cannot\ndetermine is whether the spirit-world which appears to be inhabited\nby the spirits of those who have died, is an aspect of this vast\niinterland of the psyche, or whether it can be regarded as existing\nindependently. All we know is that the spirits of the dead can\nbecome part of our experience only by means of our conscious\npsychic envelope, and just because of this inevitable condition it is\npractically impossible to determine whether they exist indepen-\ndently of the psyche, or whether they hve because the living give\nthem life.\nNOTES ON PEKIODICALS\nJournal of the British Society of Dowsers, Vol. II.

Broad of an osten-\nsibly precognitive dream which was not fulfilled. As Dr Broad points\nout in a covering letter, it is obviously desirable that such negative\ncases should be put on record, if the dreams were striking enough\n\fJune 1937 An Ostensibly Precognitive Dream Unfulfilled 83\nto be recorded at the time. We hope that any others of our members\nto whom such experiences occur may be encouraged to follow Dr\nBroad's example.\nDr Broad states that he is a very frequent dreamer and has had\nat least three experiences of ostensibly precognitive but unfulfilled\ndreams in the last few years. That this particular dream should\nhave remained unfulfilled must be a matter for rejoicing to all loyal\nsubjects. Dr. Broad's statement reads :\n\"'\nOn April 20th, 1937, I told Gatty and Thouless of the following\nostensibly precognitive dream which I had about a fortnight ago\nwhile I was at home :\n\" I dreamed that I was in Oxford on the day of the Coronation.\nAs I was walking down the street I saw several newsboys running\nout and shouting out news. I do not remember exactly what they\nsaid or what was in the placards, but the essential point was that the\nKing had died either during or just before or just after the Coro-\nnation. I was a good deal impressed and shocked, and I awoke,\ngot out of bed, and made a note. I also mentioned the matter next\nmorning to my Mother and to one of the servants.\"\n(Witnessed) (Signed) C.

Soal\nIn a paper read in January^ before the Society I emphasised the\nimportance of obtaining a random sequence of cards or numbers to\nbe guessed in experiments designed to test extra-sensory perception.\nSuch a sequence may be secured by the aid of Tippet's numbers or\nfrom an ordinary table of seven-figure logarithms. In the case where\nthe numbers are produced by the operations of a machine it is\nessential to discover if the machine has any bias or idiosyncrasies,\nsince these may happen to conform with the number habits of the\nhuman guesser, and thus bring about coincidences which are in\nexcess of those predicted by the laws of probability.\nIn this note I propose to examine the result of 2000 operations\nof Mr G. N. Tyrrell's Mechanical Selector, which produced a sequence\nof the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in apparently random order, any number\nsummary was printed in the April number of the Journal.\u2014Hon.\nEd.\nF 2\n\f84 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1937\nof repetitions of the same digit being possible. We wish to discover\nhow far this sequence of 2000 digits can be considered to be an\nunbiassed or random sequence.\nThe expected frequency of each of the five digits is of course 400\nwith standard deviation of 17-89, and the actual observed frequencies\nwere 405, 403, 399, 380, 413. It will be seen that none of the indi-\nvidual differences from 400 are significant. The value of is 1-51,\nwhich with 4 degrees of freedom gives 0-9 > P > 0-8, a value\nwhich cannot be considered abnormal.\nWe next examine whether the Selector has produced the correct\nnumbers of \" repeats \". These may be classified as \" doubles \",\n\" triples \", \" quadruples \", \" quintuples \", etc. Thus, for example,\nthe sequence 45111321445522 2 244 3 contains 1 quad-\nruple, 1 triple and 3 doubles. The expected numbers S^, S-^, S^,\nof doubles, triples, etc., are, except for trivial values of n, given for\na sequence of digits by the formulae :\n>S.> = (16w-8)\/125; ^3 = (16w -24)\/625 ;\n>S4 = (16\u00ab-80)\/3125; ^5 = 16n\/15625 (nearly).\nWith n = 2000 we obtain the following table :\nS2 *S'4\nExpected - - 256 51 10 2 0\nObserved - - 279 50 10 4 0\nStandard Deviation - 14-9 7-1\nActual Deviation - +23 -1 0 + 2 0\nAgain it is seen that the observed numbers do not differ signifi-\ncantly from tlie expectations. In this respect we may note that the\nmachine difters materially from the average human guesser who\nalmost invariably produces a deficiency of \" repeats \" in his\nsequence. In other words, he tends to change his guess from one\nnumber to another too frequently.\nA more important test, however, is to discover whether the\nmachine has sequence habits, such as a tendency to make a 2\nfollow a 3, etc., since these might either be learnt by tJie guesser\nin process of time or be the same as the guesser's own habits.\nTo investigate this question we may consider for convenience that\nthe 2000 digits are written in a circle so that the head of the pro-\ncession follows immediately the tail. We next count the number\nof pairs in which the digit r is followed immediately by the digit s\n[r, s having the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. We thus obtain the 25 numbers\nand the expectation of each w\u201e is clearly ^^999. = 80.\n\fJune 1937 A Note on Tests for Random Distribution 85\nThe observed values of n,.^ are given in the following table :\nValues of r\n1 2\no\no 4 5 Totals\n1 76 84 76 77 92 405\no\nm\n2 71 89 102 63 78 403\n3 86 79 91 79 64 399\nIs\n>\n4 82 63 61 82 92 380\n5 90 88 69 79 87 413\nTotals 405 403 399 380 413 2000\nThe value of \u2022^(^ for this distribution is then obtained by calcu-\nlating the expression :\nX' = ^K.-80]V80,\nbut it has to be noted that the 25 numbers n^^. a-i'^ not independent\nbut satisfy the obvious relations :\n%2 + %3 + \u00bb*14 + %5 = ^21 + \"^hx + \u00bb*41 + ^^51,\n^21 + ^23 + ^24 + ^25 ~ *^2 + ^32 + %2 + ^^52'\n\u00bb^31 + W32 + '^34 + \u00bb^35 = Wi3 + '^23 + W43 + ^^53.\n+ W42 + + = + W24 + \u00bb^34 + >^54\nas well as the relation\nf^oX + '^52 + '^53 + \u00ab54 = \u00bb\u00bb15 + \u00ab25 + '\u00ab35 + ^^45,\nwhich follows by addition from the fonr equations given above.\nIn addition there is the equation :\n5 5\nE E %\u201e=2000.\nr=\\ s=l\nWe have thus iive independent relations among the numbers n^s,\nand hence a system with 25 - 5 = 20 degrees of freedom. The value\nof works out to p(;2= 33-76, and this gives P = 0-04 nearly.\nThere would seem therefore to be some slight evidence in favour of\nthe view that each operation of Mr Tyrrell's machine is not entirely\nindependent of the preceding operation, but it camiot be regarded\n\f86 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1937\nas in any way conclusive. Possibly a larger number of trials might\nbring it out more clearly. The standard deviation of each of the\nnumbers n^g is 8-76, and of the 25 observed values there are five\nwhose deviations from 80 either exceed, or closely approximate to,\ntwice the standard deviation. There are thus rather more abnormal\nvalues than one would expect, but the evidence is far from con-\nclusive.\nIt might be possibly the case (though I doubt it) that the numbers\nn^g satisfy other non-linear relations that I have failed to notice,\nbut if such relations existed the effect would be to reduce still further\nthe degrees of freedom and thus emphasise the abnormality.\nAn alternative method is to divide the 2000 digits into 1000\nseparate and consecutive pairs. If the digits are arranged in a ring\nthis could be effected in two different ways, and for each method of\ndivision we should have a system with 25 - 1 = 24 degrees of free-\ndom, since now the numbers related only by the single\nequation 5 5\nZ U w'\u201e = 1000.\nThe two values of corresponding to the two different methods\nof separation are not independent of each other. But as I find on\ntrial that both values give values of P lying between 0-02 and 0-05,\nthe result tends to confirm that obtained from the previous method.\nSOME RECENT INVESTIGATIONS\nCAREIED OUT BY THE SOCIETY 1\nMr. Herbert began by referring to the complaints that are some-\ntimes made that the Society does not do enough in the matter of\ninvestigation, and that too few spontaneous cases are printed in the\nJournal. In actual fact, more than 120 cases have been investigated\nsince Mr Herbert has been working for the Society, each of which has\nbeen carefully filed and indexed. The reason that so few have found\ntheir way into the Journal is that the investigation revealed that the\nmajority were not sufficiently evidential of paranormahty to warrant\ntheir being printed. Mr Herbert gave examples of cases which,\nthough appearing at first sight to be very evidential, turned out in\nthe end to be of httle value, owing to flaws in the evidence which\nwere only revealed on detailed investigation.\nOn the question of quantitative methods of research, Mr Herbert\nsaid that the present poUcy of the Research Department was to use\n1 Summary of a paper read to the Society by Mr C. V. C. Herbert at a\nprivate meeting held on March 24, 1937.\n\fJuke 1937 Recent Investigations Carried out by the Society 87\nthese whenever possible, and more especially in connection with\nphenomena which qualitative research has shown to be highly evi-\ndential of paranormality. Mr Herbert descrihed a quantitative\ntechnique for application to Leonard Book-tests, which is being used\nat the present time at Mr Irving's sittings, and he referred also to a\nquantitative method for deaHng with a claim to obtain paranormal\ninformation by examination of specimens of handwriting.\nMr Herbert then read a report received from Mr Guenault of an\ninvestigation carried out by him at the Society's request of a case of\nPoltergeist manifestations in Leeds.\nThe main piece of research which has occupied the Research\nDepartment during this season is an elaborate experiment with\nMrs Eileen Garrett on the lines followed by J. G. Pratt in his work\nwith the same subject (Boston S.P.R., Bulletin XXIII, March 1936).\nThe method is an extension of the system of evaluation devised by\nMessrs Saltmarsh and Soal and described by them in their paper in\nProceedings, vol. 39, p. 266. Although the experiment is not yet\nconcluded, Mr Herbert said that he thought it advisable to mention\nit so that Members might have less difficulty in understanding the\nmethod when an account of it was eventually published.\nMY EXPERIMENTS WITH S. F. SAMBOR i\nBy Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo\nS. F. Sambor was the name of a Russian professional physical medium\n(a native of Volhynia, in Southern Russia, and possibly either of\nPoHsh or of Hungarian extraction) who \" practised \" from 1893\nor 1894 to 1902. He came to St Petersburg for the first time in\nthe spring of 1894.\nIn the course of some seven or eight years (I did not \" sit \" with\nhim, I believe, throughout 1895) I had with him 105 seances (of at\nleast three hours' duration each). During several winters I \" sat\n\"\nin a circle of which Colonel (later on General) Brussiloff (the one who\nsuccessfully \" hammered the Hun \" on the Austrian front during\nthe War) was a member, also at times Vsevolod Solovioff, the\nnovehst and at first friend, then antagonist, of Mme Blavatsky's.\nLater on I formed another circle which had a special aim in view,\nand of which neither Solovioff nor Brussiloff (a charming man but\nawfully credulous) were members.\n^ This is the summary of a paper read at a private meeting of the S.P.R.\non April 28th, 1937.\u2014Hon. Ed.\n\f88 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1937\nIn the Brussiloff circle (and I think in most cases) most seances\nwere perfect blanks. Still, interesting results were from time to\ntime obtained. The seances took place generally in the dark, and\nin Hght hardly anything occurred as a rule (to this rule there were,\nhowever, exceptions). It should be said that Sanibor consented\nvery willingly to being adequately controlled. In particular his\nhands were very well held (grasped), the \" chain \" being almost\ninvariably formed on the knees of the sitters. Never did I notice\nany attempt at a surreptitious liberation of a hand.\nOne of Sambor's speciahties was the alleged \" passage of matter\nthrough matter \", which took the form of chairs being \" threaded\n\"\non the arm of the medium's neighbour, without S.'s hand having\n(apparently) been released at all, and of the production of three-\ndimensional knots in \" endless \" strings or even (in one case) in a\nseamless leathern ring. In the latter case the ring in question was\nmysteriously threaded on my own arm (I was the medium's neigh-\nbour on the right). This \" ring \" incident is open to grave doubts,\nand yet some details do not lend themselves in my opinion to the\nhypothesis of fraud quite easily.\nAt times I also took part in seances in other circles than my own.\nAt one such seance\u2014the only one, I think, out of 105\u2014the pheno-\nmena could only have been produced by a person moving freely\nabout the room. At another, in another circle, \" direct \" writing\nwas obtained in a hermetically nailed up sheet-iron cone specially\nprepared several weeks before, as an experiment, by two engineers.\nBut we did not succeed, though we repeatedly tried, in obtaining\nwriting under still more stringent conditions (the bottom of the cone\nbeing this time made of glass).\nMeanwhile I had formed a circle composed of persons I knew\nthoroughly well in order to test Sambor's \" chair threading \" perfor-\nmances. Of the results obtained I will speak farther on. The two\nlast sittings of this series were quite remarkable, in fact the pheno-\nmena were so abundant and so striking that I felt thoroughly con-\nvinced at last. Alas! it turned out later on that one of the sitters\nwho \" controlled \" Sambor on these two occasions was not by any\nmeans above suspicion. And yet he was a friend and colleague of\nmine at the Chancery of the Imperial Ministry of Foreign Affairs,\nan intrepid mountaineer, a distinguished writer and in a general\nway a very pleasant gentleman. Still, it was proved subsequently\nthat on two other occasions at least he was not controlling\nthe medium {not Sambor, who had died in 1902), and I strongly\nsuspect that he was instrumental in producing abundant apports,\nboth at the two above-mentioned Sambor seances and at others.\n\fJune 1937 My Experiments with S. F. Sambor 89\nIt should be added, however, that Chamberlain X. never confessed\nhaving deceived us, in fact maintained later on he had never cheated,\nwhen pressed by me to avow in dramatic circumstances connected\nwith my brother's death ;\nbut I have little doubt he was not telling\nthe truth.\nHis case seems to me very edifying. Here, in my own chosen\ncircle, a man with whom I was on the best of terms deceived us\nanonymously without any apparent motive. Who can tell how often\nsuch incidents may have taken place elsewhere without becoming\nknown? Who can tell how often such episodes were hushed up?\nHere, in this morbid tendency to deceive anonymously and\nsystematically merely for the sake of deceiving, how much havoc\nmay have been wrought in Psychical Research!\nThe discovery of the part played by Chamberlain X. obliges me,\nalas\u2014surely a tremendous pity\u2014to throw overboard by far the\nbest phenomena I observed with S. F. Sambor. And yet a few things\nsurvive : rari nantes in gurgite vasto.\nThe phenomena of \" chair-threading \", to investigate which I\nformed a special circle in 1899, remam unaffected by the X. incident.\nWe have to throw away but one experiment out of seven, for in\nthat experiment X. \" controlled \". Six other experiments suc-\nceeded with six different sitters, myself included\u2014and here the\npart X. might have played is no explanation.\nFor in such experiments we had to pay attention only to the\nmedium's handg\u2014nay, at times, to one of his hands only. Neither\nthe position of his head nor that of his feet, nor the possible presence\nof an accomplice was of any importance whatever. The chairs, of\ncourse, were above suspicion.\nMy circle held altogether seventeen seances. We took great care\nnever to put out the light before the chain had been formed, and\nwe invariably verified in the light the controller's statement that a\nchair had been threaded on his arm. That the phenomenon did\noccur under such conditions, whilst the medium's hands were held\nvery satisfactorily, we convinced ourselves completely. When\nvarious niethods of tying were applied no results were obtained, it\nis true. This is to be much regretted, but does not invaUdate the\nsuccessful experiments\u2014the more so as there are various incidents\non record which occurred in other circles and which are distinctly\npuzzling. I know, for instance, at first hand of a case when a chair\nwas threaded not on the controller's arm which was next to the\nmedium, but on his other arm. I know also at first hand of another\ncase when two chairs were simultaneously threaded on the arm of\na Mme Youdenitch, who was holding Sambor's hand. Still holding\n\f90 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1937\nit, she brought her wrist near her shoulder, thus squeezing the\nbacks of the two chairs between her forearm and upper arm. Where-\nupon they seemed to her to \" open \" (her expression) and both\nchairs fell on the ground !\nI think the most plausible explanation of such curious episodes\n(as well as of the results obtained by me) lies in the domain of some\nform of (mental) suggestion, possibly unconscious. Provisionally\nat least I decline to believe in trickery as an explanation. And since\nwhat occurred repeatedly with the late Sambor can undoubtedly\nhappen with other mediums, I suggest that a fruitful line of\ninvestigation may possibly lie that way.\nIn justice to Sambor, it should be added that there is no evidence\nwhatsoever of Chamberlain X. having been with this medium in\ncollusion in the technical sense of the word. Supposing Sambpr's\ntrance to have been genuine, it is quite conceivable he may not even\nhave known that his hand had been released. Even if the trance\nwas not genuine we are not by any means bound to postulate an\nentente between X. and Sambor prior to the seance ; in fact I am\nconvinced there had been none.\nPerovsky-PetroVO-SOLOvovo\n.\nREVIEWS\nMind, Medicine and Metaphysics. By Dr William Brown (Wilde\nReader in Mental Philosophy, Oxford). (Oxford University\nPress.) Pp. 294. 7s. 6d.\nThe essays and lectures which make up this volume cover a very\nlarge area of medical and metaphysical facts and theories, and form\na useful addition to the hbrary of those \" general readers \" who are\ninterested in such topics and welcome their presentation in clear\nand not too technical language.\nThe special value of the book is that the subject-matter, whether\nconcerned with psycho-analysis, religious experiences, mediumistic\ntrance or other phenomena, rests, so to speak, on a foundation of\nmedical theory and practice\u2014a present-day outline of a \" rehgio\nmedici \".\nIf any criticism may be fairly levelled against those extraordinarily\ninteresting chapters, it is that the author has too often compressed\nhis matter within far too narrow a compass. To the important\nquestion e.g. of \" Psychical Research and Survival \" is allotted\nscarcely more than a single page. No mention is made in this con-\n\fJune 1937 Reviews 91\nnection of the phenomena of clairvoyance, phantasms of the Uving\nand dead, or cross-correspondence as bearing on the problem of\nsmrvival. This is disappointing when one remembers that the author\nevidently beheves in survival and is himself a psychical researcher\nof recognised standing and wide experience.\nAs regards one section of the chapter on \" Ethical Arguments for\nSurvival \" it is rather difficult for some of us to share the author's\noptimistic outlook on the present. Dr. Brown's opinion is that \" the\nwhole himian race is becoming more and more rehgious, more and\nmore moral in its outlook \". Can such a thesis really be sustained\nin face of the current facts of modern social life : the cruel self-\nseeking of the nations, the infamies of Manchukuo and Ethiopia, the\nmoral failures of the League of Nations, rehgious collapse in Russia,\nMexico, Spain, and our own half-empty churches, chapels and Sunday\nschools'?\nDr. Brown deals in a spirit of sympathy and common sense with\nvarious aspects of the \" Oxford Group movement, and gives us\n.some very interesting pages on the psychology of international rela-\ntions and war in which the importance and value of \" psychological\n-disarmament \" are stressed as compared with any mere orgy of\npacifist sentiment. E. N. B.\nThe Testimony of the Soul. By Rufus M. Jones, Litt.D., D.D.,\nLL.D. Pp.215. (NewYork,\"TheMacmillanCo.) Price 8s. 6d. net.\nDr Jones is very well known as a Quaker writer on mystical\nleUgion, and the main interest of this book lies outside the scope of\npsychical research. There are however certain points at which any\nwriter on mysticism is brought into contact with the phenomena of\npsychical research and the theories based on them.\nThe type of mysticism which finds favour with Dr Jones is one in\nwhich ecstasy plays a neghgible part : he goes so far (p. 197) as to call\nit a psychopathic phenomenon. He is not accordingly predisposed in\nfavour of the value of automatic writing, and his own experience\ntends to corffirm him in his opinion. He emphasises, as every psychi-\ncal researcher would do, '\"\nthe formative operation of the (auto-\nmatist's) subconscious Ufe,'' and while accepting the view that \" the\ninterior life of the individual is in immediate contact with environing\nspirit \" holds that \" what conies from beyond is in the nature of con-\ntact, sense of presence, heightening of the quality of life, increase of\ndynamic, rather than ready-made \"\ncommunications and that\nthe effect is richer when the whole self is united\".\n\f92 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 193T\nThis is perhaps true enough of all but exceptional cases, but every\nstudent of psychical research can point to instances in which there is\nreason to beUeve that something much more definite than the author\nwould allow has \" come from beyond \"\n;\nknowledge, for example,,\nof facts not normally known.

The President\nin the Chair.\nMr C. C. L. Gregory brought with him a short paper entitled 'On\nthe Possibility of a Theory of Psychical Research'. This, however,\nwas not read as it was considered to be too much concerned with\nmechanics. !Mr Gregory read a letter he had received from Mr TyrreU\nin which the latter suggested that a discussion deaUng with the ex-\n\f96 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1937\nplanation of cases from the common-sense point of view rather than\nfrom the metaphysical was what was wanted. Mr Tyrrell also pointed\nout that \" Motivation \", in the sense of purposefully directed events,\npervades the greater part of the field of psychical research just as it\ndoes of psychology, and that the question of the explanation of\nmotivated phenomena has to be dealt with.\nMr Gregory said that, in his opinion, metaphysics could not be\nkept out of the discussion, as it was concerned with what the ordin-\nary man considered to be real as opposed to illusory. The positivist\nmight claim to be concerned only with his sense impressions of, say,\na table, and not be at all concerned with a metaphysical table which\nmight be supposed to cause these impressions. Different metaphysics\nwere current at different times and in different countries. He illus-\ntrated this by a diagram which exhibited realism and ideaUsm as\nseparated in conscious modes of thought. He suggested that a scale\nof objectivity might be usefully employed in the technique of Psy-\nchical Research. This might prove to be more useful than attempting\nto establish the reality of certain psychical phenomena. One could\nimagine ten men entering a room in succession, the first nine experi-\nencing slight uneasiness and saying they would not care to sleep by\nthemselves in that room. The tenth might say he saw a large pink\ntoad in the corner of the room, the size of an ox, who sprang upon\nhim. Clearly the pink toad would be looked upon as illusory or\n\" subjective experience \" were it not that the other nine men had\nexperienced some unusual feehngs. Perhaps reality had two\naspects.\nMr Tyrrell said that Psychical Research was in the same situation\nas Psychology with regard to motivated thought and action. Not\nonly the conscious mind, but also all that region of human personality\nwhich we, in psychical research, call the \" subliminal \" and which\npsychologists call either the \" subconscious \" or the \" unconscious \",\nwas full of motivation. And the whole of that branch of psychical\nresearch which deals with \" mental \" phenomena deals with material\nwhich owes its form to some kind of purposeful direction, and might\ntherefore be called \" motivated \". Thus, if Mr. Gregory meant to\nexclude motivated events from the purview of scientific research,\nthis would exclude all that part of the subject which many people\nbelieved to be the most important.\nMr T3a'rell said he was in agreement with Mr Gregory in believing\nthat no scientific research was possible which attempted to deal with\nfacts apart from theory. No one in fact ever did attempt to deal\nwith facts apart from theory. If you attempted to collect mere\nfacts, and rigidly refrained from having any theory about them at\n\fJuly 1937 Private Meetings 97\nall, you would collect every kind of fact indifferently, and you would\nhave a hotch-potch of observations without rhyme or reason, which\nwould be hterally meaningless. The S.P.R. never had collected facts\nwithout reference to theory. If it had, it would have ceased to exist\nlong ago. It had always cared very much about the possible explan-\nations of the facts which it collected, and had rejected those facts\nwhich, on the face of it, seemed exphcable by hypotheses other than\nsupernormal. In other words, it had always been profoundly in-\nterested in theory. MTiat had caused a curious cross-current in the\npohcy of our Society was that it had been extremely careful never to\nexpress any opinion as to the explanation of its facts which might be\nconstrued as a collective opinion, held by the Society as a body. It\nhad been afraid of being charged with holding some sort of fixed\nbelief or creed. And this had led to the frequent profession by the\nS.P.R. that it was a body for collecting facts but not for expressing\nany opinion on them.\nIt was fairly obvious that there was an inconsistency here, for\nthe Society as a body did express an opinion about its material by\nits very method of collecting it. It was not true that it stopped, or\ncould stop, at collecting facts. It continually passed judgment on\nthem : if it did not, it would have to give up all claim to be a scienti-\nfic body. Yet one might fully agree that it was most undesirable\nthat it should commit itself to anything hke a general creed about\nsupernormal phenomena.\nHow was this inconsistency to be resolved? At a General Meeting\nof the Society on 24 February last, he, Mr Tyrrell, had suggested\nthat when cases were published, in suitable instances the Society\nshould not refrain from gi^^ng as assessment of theory at the end of\nthe case, iadicating to what explanation the probabiHties pointed.\nHis argument was that the Society as a body was already committed\nto judging the explanations of its material, and might as well come\nout into the open and say so, thus giving the reader the benefit of its\nopinion through its Research Ofiicer or other duly appointed official.\nThis suggestion had been rejected on the ground that, if it did this,\nthe Society would commit itself to a general creed about the causes\nof psychical phenomena as a whole.\nBut this contention seemed to rest on a confusion. What the\nS.P.R. was committed to was not an attitude towards psychical\nphenomena in general, but an attitude towards the explanation of\neach separate piece of evidence individually and in particular. These\ntwo things were quite different. The Society might quite well express\nthe opinion, through one of its officers, that the most probable\nexplanation of a particular case was that it was due to telepathy, or\n\f98 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1937\nto the memory of a discarnate being, or to fraud, or to chance, with-\nout committing itself to a general defence of any one of these explana-\ntions in all cases ;\nany more than a jury which brings in a verdict of\nmurder against one particular prisoner was committed to trying to\nconvict all prisoners as murderers. It was possible to express various\nopmions on various occasions without committing oneself to an\northodoxy or a creed.\nMr Tyrrell suggested that the S.P.R. in proclaiming its indiffer-\nence to the theoretical significance of its individual results was adopt-\ning an inconsistent position, which it could not logically maintain.\nHe again put forward the suggestion that an official discussion of\ncertain cases from the theoretical point of view was needed.\nThe President :\nI think that before we decide on any poKcy about\nthe Society expressing its opinion we should enquire a httle more\nclosely as to what meaning attaches to that expression. The Society\nconsists of people interested in a certain branch of enquiry, who have\nthe quahfication of being respectable and personally agreeable to the\nother members, all wilhng, all able to pay their subscriptions ; but\nnot necessarily of any special technical quahfications. It includes\nindividuals of very varied attainments\u2014very varied opinions of\nwhat constitutes good evidence. When one speaks of the opinion of\nthe Society, it certainly does not imply that they are all unanimously\nof that opinion, as a jury is expected to be. So far as it means any-\nthing, it means presumably that that is the opinion of the majority.\nBut it seems to me useless to count opinions in that way in an assembly\nso varied as ours. The opinion of the majority may not be at all the\nsame as the opinion of those whom the Society would regard as its\nleaders. Moreover, many members would not consider themselves\nquahfied to express an opinion on all the Society's activities. I for\none certainly should not consider myself so qualified, and I do not\nwant what I am saymg to be considered to have any special authoj-\nity because I happen to occupy the Presidential Chaii- for the time\nbeing. I only hope you will consider it on its merits as a contribution\nto the discussion. There is good precedent for the course I recom-\nmend : that the Society should not commit itself to opinions on con-\ntroversial subjects. The Eoyal Society prints a notice in every\nvolume of its Transactions to say that it does not as a Society pro-\nnounce on any question. That I submit should be our attitude.\nOpinions must stand on their merits : and if we print them, that\ncommits us to nothing more than that the Council think it expedient\nthat they should be printed. But the responsibihty should rest on\ntheir authors.\nOn the question raised by Mr Tyrrell with regard to motivation.\n\fJuly 1937 Private Meetings 99\nMr Gregory said he agreed with Professor MacMurray that there\ncould be no scientific criteria of the motives behind acts\u2014motivation\nwas rather within the province of the legal profession, who were ac-\ncustomed to judge motive as what might be reasonably supposed\nunder the given circumstances.\nThe following Members also took part in the discussion :\nMr\nKenneth Richmond, Mr Hettinger, the Hon. Mrs Alfred Lyttelton,\nG.B.E., Lieut.-Colonel C. R. L. FitzGerald, and Mrs Goldney.\nThe 150th Private Meeting of the Society was held in the Society's\nLibrary on Wednesday, 30 June 1937, at 5.30 p.m., The Hon. Mrs\nAlfred Lyttelton, G.B.E., in the Chair.\nProfessor R. H. Thouless read a paper entitled \" A Review of\nMr Whately Carington's Work on Trance Personahties \" which ^vill,\nit is hoped, be pubUshed later in Proceedings.\nAN EXPERIMENT WITH MRS GARRETT\nIn a recent paper,* J. G. Pratt has described two series of sittings\nwith the weU-known subject Mrs Eileen Garrett. In the first serie_s,\nthe sitter was present in the same room as the subject, but came in\nafter she had assumed her trance state. The sitter did not speak\nduring the sitting. In the second series, the sitter was not in the\nsame room as Mrs Garrett, so that all leakage was ehminated. In\nboth series, the records of the several sittings were combined to-\ngether in the form of a questionnaire, each question being answerable\nby yes or no. This was submitted to all the sitters, and from the\nanswers, the probability of the results obtained being due to chance\nalone was computed by means of the Saltmarsh-Soal formula, i\nIn\nboth series, Pratt obtained significant figures for some of the sittings.\nThis experiment was obviously of such great importance that the\nSociety decided it should be repeated in London at the earliest op-\nportunity. Accordingly, on the return of Mrs Garrett to England m\nthe summer of 1936, she was approached with a view to the per-\nformance of a similar test, and very kindly placed herself entirely at\nthe Society's disposal. SLx sittings were held during the summer and\nearly autumn of 1936, the conditions being the same as in Pratt's-\nsecond series, except that the sitter was not present in the same\nbuilding as the subject. This may seem to some to have been a\n* \" Towards a Method of Evaluating Mediumistic Material,\" Bulletin xxiii,\nBoston S.P.R. (1936).\n^Proceedings, S.P.R., Vol. xxxlx, p. 266 (1930).\n\fJournal of Society for Psychical Research July 1937\nneedless and additional difficulty, but Mrs Garrett herself, who was\nconsulted in the matter, declared that she was convinced that it did\nnot make the slightest difference where the sitter was, the only\nrequisite being that the sitter should bear in mind during the sitting\nthat the experiment was in progress.\nThe six persons who took part in the experiment were all experi-\nenced sitters, who had obtained results with other \" mediums \", and\nwho could be relied upon to return accurate and truthful answers to\nthe questionnaire. The preparation of the questionnaire involved\nvery considerable labour, as each of six long records had to be broken\nup into questions, which were then combined to form the final docu-\nment. The actual questionnaire, which contained nearly 600\nquestions, was submitted to the sitters in the spring of this year.\nWhen the answers were received they were entered in a table, and\nthe percentage of yes answers was computed in each case, firstly for\nthe questions which embodied the sitter's own sitting and secondly\nfor the questions relating to the other sittings. The results were\ndistinctly promising. They are shown in the following table :\nWhole Own Other Sitters'\nQuestionnaire Material Material\nSitter\nTotal Percentage Total Percentage Total Percentage\nNo. of of yes No. of of yes No. of of yes\nansw ers ansvver.s answers answers answers answers\nA 263 20-91 59 16-95 204 22 -06\nB 221 19 46 26 19 -23 195 19-49\nC 297 31 -65 47 29-79 250 32 -00\nD 247 26-72 30 33-33 217 25 -81\nE 311 34 -40 104 40-38 207 31 -40\nF 299 33 -78 25 36 -00 274 31 -02\nIt will be seen that sitters D, E and F have all scored a higher per-\ncentage of yes answers on those parts of the questionnaire that were\nprepared from their own sittings than on the questions which were\nmeant to apply to the other sitters. Sitter E in particular has\nscored 40 -38% of yes answers for his own material as against only\n31-02% for the other sitters' material. Such results seemed amply\nto justify the additional labour involved in applying the Saltmarsh-\nSoal formula * to the results, and this was accordingly done.\n*C It\nlog M) + {UpJogp}\n\"JU pq {log j))^\n\fJuly 1937 An Experiment with Mrs. Garrett 101\nIn order to arrive at an accurate value for the probability of the\ntruth of each question as apphed to sitters in general, copies of the\nquestionnaire were submitted to 36 members of the Society who had\nnot been sitters in the experiment. Of these no less than 30 were\nkind enough to supply sets of answers, and the thanks of the Society\nare due to them for their trouble in the matter. From the 15,000\nanswers contained in these replies, very accurate values were\nobtainable of the general probability of each question. For each\nquestion this was estimated by dividing the total number of yes\nanswers by the total number of yes and no answers, the result being\nworked out to two decimal places.\nSubstitution of these values in the formula produced very disap-\npointing results. The values of the critical ratio for sittings D, E\nand F were 0-20, 1-38 and 0-24 respectively. None of these ap-\nproaches significance, so we are forced to conclude that the apparently\nsignificant results of the table are easily explainable on the theory of\nchance coincidence. We regret therefore that our results do not\nsupport those obtained by J. G. Pratt in America, though they do\nnot, of course, in any sense invahdate his results. It is understood\nthat a further repetition of the experiment is being undertaken by\nthe International Institute for Psychical Research, and it is hoped\nthat a significant result may be obtained.\nC. V. C. Herbert\nCORRESPONDENCE\nMr S. G. Soal's Tests of the Mechanical Selector\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal\nMadam,\u2014Mr Soal, in the last number of the Journal (Vol. XXX,\np. 83), reports the result of a test of 2000 numbers taken from the\nMechanical Selector with which the results in Clairvoyance were\nobtained with Miss G. M. Johnson, which were published in the\nProceedings, Vol. xliv, pp. 150-151. The tests were for randomness\nin (1) frequencies, (2)\n\" repeats \", and (3) sequences of numbers,\nand confirm that there is no significant deviation from pure random-\nness in any of these particulars. This is only to be expected, since\neach of the five numbers has five separate contacts on the rotating\nswitch, and any shght differences in friction which might exist\nwould be spread.\n\f102 Journal of Sociehj for Psychical Research July 1937\nBut owing to the fact that Mr Seal has failed to understand the\nway in which these numbers were used, he has not reahsed that\ndeviations from randomness of the first and third types would not\nhave affected the results even if they had existed in the Selector.\nThus he speaks of idiosyncrasies which \" may happen to conform\nto the number habits of the himian guesser, and thus bring about\ncoincidences which are in excess of those predicted by the laws of\nprobabihty \". And again he says : \"A more important test, how-\never, is to discover whether the machine has sequence habits, such as\na tendency to make a 2 follow a 3, etc., since these might either be\nlearnt by the guesser in process of time or be the same as the guesser's\nown habits.\" This is impossible, because all the numbers were\npassed through the Commutator, as was explained in the Report\nreferred to above. This neutrahses all possibiUty of habits of the\nSelector coinciding with habits of the subject, since the Commutator\nis reset for each experiment. Clearly, if Selector and Subject both\nhad a preference for (say) (a) the middle box, or (6) following a 3\nup with a 2, their preferences might coincide with one setting of\nthe Commutator, but would be out of coincidence with the other\nseven settings.\nThe only test which has any relevance to the actual results is\ntest (2), dealing with the number of \" repeats \". From the nature\nof things, a mechanical device can scarcely go wrong in this respect.\nIt would take judgement to do so. Mr Soal's test merely confirms\nthe fact that it is perfectly normal.\nApart, however, from this, Mr Soal's method of dealing with the\nmechanically selected numbers tends to produce a false impression\nowing to the things he leaves unsaid. Even if there were a deviation\nfrom true randomness in the figures (and the tests show that there\nis not), the effect on the results depends on the opportunities for\ncoincidence between a habit of the machine's and a habit of the\npercipient's. The \" Zener \" cards, so largely used for E.S.P. tests,\nare very far from giving a truly random sequence ; but this does\nnot matter so long as the percipient has no opportunity of taking\nadvantage of the fact. Suppose, now, as Mr Soal suggests, that the\nSelector had a strong tendency to follow up a 3 with a 2\u2014suppose\nit did this three times out of four\u2014and that the percipient did the\nsame thing, and that there was no Commutator to nullify the\neffect, clearly most of these \" 3-2's \" would not coincide with one\nanother. They could only have an effect on the score after a success\nwith a 3. At a chance rate of scoring, there would only be on the\naverage 4 successes with a 3 in 100 trials ; and of these only three\ncould be coincidences and only two might be. And if, in the same\n\fJuly 1937 Correspondence 103\nway, one works out the effect of number-preferences, say for the\nmiddle box, one finds that it has to be abnormally high to give the\nkind of results given by a good subject.\nUsing the numbers which Mr Soal has tested, and, of com'se,\nusing the Commutator as well, 7,809 trials, with Jliss G. M. Johnson\nas subject, gave 1,841 successes, the conditions being that of Pure\nClairvoyance, owing to the operator's ignorance of what lamp was\nbeing ht. The odds against this being due to chance are somewhere\nabout a hundred milhon million to one (P = 10^^* approx.). Since\nthis result was pubhshed in the above Report, the trials amount to\n10,959 and the successes to 2,608, and still higher odds against\nchance.\nSince it is quite clear that no number habits can have anything\nto do with this result, and since the safeguards with which the\nmachine is provided prevent any source of normal knowledge from\nreaching the percipient, it would be interesting to know whether\nany reader of the Journal can suggest an explanation of these\nresults other than that of Pure Clairvoyance.\nYours etc., G. N. M. Tyrrell.\nREVIEW\nA Voice from the Grandstand. By Sir Auckland Geddes, P.C,\nG.C.M.G., K.C.B., M.D. Reprinted from the Edinburgh Medical\nJournal, N. S. (IVth), Vol. XLIV, p. 365, 1937.\nMany of our readers may have noticed in Light some weeks ago an\nextract from an address dehvered by Sir Auckland Geddes on the\noccasion of the bi-centenary of the Royal Medical Society, which\ncontained an extremely interesting account by a medical man, who,\nin Sir Auckland's words, \" passed into the very portals of death and\nwas brought back to hfe by medical treatment. The record was\ntaken down in shorthand by a skilled secretary as life was re-\nestablishing itself \". Sir Auckland has courteously presented to the\nSociety's Library an offprint of his Address, and members are\nstrongly advised to read it, not only for a full account of the experi-\nence mentioned above, but also for the lecturer's comments on the\nrelation of the bodily organism to Soid, Mind, Spirit (to use the\ndefinition which the lecturer adopts), and on the attitude of science,\nand particularly medical science, to the problems connected there-\nwith.\n\f104 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1937\nIt is difficult to do justice to the experience of the apparently\ndying doctor without quoting it in full, but the following extracts\nindicate a few points of outstanding interest. After explaining that\none night, shortly after midnight, he found himself to be suffering\nfrom acute gastro-enteritis, and that at no stage of the experience\nwas his consciousness in any way dimmed, he continues :\n\" but I\nsuddenly realised that my consciousness was separating from another\nconsciousness, which was also me. These for purposes of description\nwe could call the A and B consciousness, and throughout what follows\nthe ego attached itself to the A consciousness. The B personahty I\nrecognised as belonging to the body, and as my physical condition\ngrew worse and the heart was fibrillating rather than beating, I\nrealised that the B consciousness belonging to the body was begin-\nning to show signs of being composite, that is, built up of ' conscious-\nnesses '\nfrom the head, the heart, the viscera, etc. These components\nbecame more individual and the B consciousness began to disinte-\ngrate, while the A consciousness which was now me, seemed to be\naltogether outside my body, which it could see.\" After adding that\nhe could see anything he chose to see \" in London, Scotland and\nelsewhere,\" the percipient proceeds, \" the explanation which I\nreceived, from what source I do not know, but which I found myself\ncalling to myself my mentor, was that I was free in a time dimension\nof space, wherein '\nnow* ' was in some way equivalent to '\nhere '\nin\nthe ordinary three-dimensional space of everyday life.\"\nThe \" mentor \" explained the problems of three, four and five-\ndimensional universes to him. The percipient began to recognise\npeople and saw \" psychic condensations attached to various people,\ncombined in some cases with visual impressions of different colours \".\nShortly afterwards the doctor who had been hastily summoned\nmade an injection which caused his heart to beat more strongly ; \"I\nwas drawn back, and I was intensely annoyed, because I was so\ninterested and just beginning to understand where I was and what I\nwas '\nseeing '. I came back into the body really angry at being\npulled back, and once I was back all the clarity of vision of anything\nand everything disappeared and I was just possessed of a glimmer\nof consciousness, which was suffused with pain. It is surprising to\nnote that this dream, vision or experience has shown no tendency to\nfade like a dream would fade, nor has it shown any tendency that I\nam aware of to grow or to rationalise itself as a dream would do.\"\nThis experience is in many ways similar to that of Dr Wiltse as\nrelated in Vol. VIII of our Proceedings, p. 180, and Vol. II of Myers's\nHuman Personality, pp. 315-323 ; so similar as to raise the question\nwhether the percipient had read Dr Wiltse's account, in which event\n\fJuly 1937 Reviews 105\nit might be supposed that his own experience had been affected by\nthe impression created by reading Dr Wiltse's narrative. The\nKesearch Officer accordingly enquired of Sir Auckland Geddes as to\nthis, and was informed that the percipient certainly never had read\nour Proceedings, but might possibly have seen the account in Hnincm\nPersonality, though he had no recollection of having done so. There\nare, however, significant points of difference : the percipient in the\nmore recent case found himself receiving explanations from wha,t\nseemed to him an extraneous source which was only faintly personi-\nfied : whereas in Dr Wiltse's case the place of this almost impersonal\n\" mentor \" was taken by a \" presence \", the vehicle of whose mani-\nfestations was a thunder-cloud, a thing almost universally associated\nwith the idea of divinity.\nSir Auckland Geddes stresses the absence from the experience he\nrecords of the \" metaphysical \" and adds, \" It is thus to be sharply\ndistinguished from the records of the spiritual adventures of the\nmystics. These belong to the plane of spirit, which is supernatural \".\nBut it is probably useful, while not ignoring the admitted distinc-\ntions, to consider together Sir Auckland's case, the Wiltse case,\nsome of the pubhshed records of the trance, and particularly the\n\" waking stage of both Mrs Piper and Mrs Willett, and various\nmystic experiences, in view of the elements which, notwithstanding\ngreat variety of mise-en-scene, are common to all of them. These\nseem to include a sense of the splitting of the personality into\n\" consciousnesses \" of varying degrees of importance and perma-\nnence, of contact with external intelligence more or less highly\npersonified, and of annoyance and disappointment when the ex-\nperience begins to \" fade into the light of common day \". All this\nmay of course be subjective, but it would be a mistake to overlook\nthe fact that the more direct and immediate the experience, the\ngreater is the consensus.\nIt is to be noted that Sir Auckland states his opinion that tele-\npathy \" must be accepted as a primary datum of science \".\nW.

Editors: William McDougall\nand William Banks Rhine.\nWe extend a hearty welcome to this new periodical \" a scientific\nquarterly dealing with telepathy, clairvoyance and other para-\npsychological problems\". The special object of its promoters, as set\nforth in an editorial introduction, is to foster the study of these\nproblems in University centres. \" If, then, the other branches of\nscience have thriven and built up bodies of well-founded knowledge\nand illuminating theory, only by means of the co-operative en-\ndeavors of many highly trained speciahsts working in laboratories\nfind observatories, with specialized methods and instruments pro-\nvided by universities and other great institutions of the higher learn-\ning, what hope of similar success in this most difficult branch so long\nas it is prosecuted without similar advantages ? . . . More than any\nother research worker, the student of psychical research needs to\nlive and work in a community of students and specialists along\nmany lines such as can only be found in the university.\"\nAt these opinions the Society for Psychical Research will certainly\nnot cavil. It has long been the opinion of students in this country\nthat a closer rapprochement between academic science and psychical\nresearch was greatly to be desired. If the gulf between them has\nbeen considerably narrowed in the last fifty years and foundations\nlaid upon which it may prove possible to build a bridge, this may\nfairly be claimed to be due in a large measure to the work of the\nS.P.R. and its founders, \" amateurs \" though they themselves may\nhave been. .:,\nWe wish our fellow-workers in America all success.\nH. DE G. S.\nThe Journal of Parapsychology. Vol. I. No. 1, March 1937.\nThis number contains some interesting papers on experiments in\nextra-sensory perception. Mr J. G. Pratt describes his work with\nthe special Zener, or E.S.P. cards, in which the subject was required\nto match the unknown card to one of the five samples which were\nplaced before him. In the first series of experiments, the five key\ncards were placed face upwards, and the subject indicated with a\npointer which of the key cards resembled the unknown card pre-\nsented to him. In the second series, the key cards were themselves\nunknown, being placed face downwards, and covered with blank\ncards. Adequate precautions were taken to insure that the subject\n\fJvLY 1937 Notes on Periodicals 107\ncould not deduce by normal means the identity of the key cards.\nWith this method, in a series of 7,800 trials with a particular subject,\na critical ratio of 5-3 was obtained. This gives odds of some 2,500,000\nto 1 against chance alone being responsible. In order to provide a\ncontrol experiment, the cards were dealt two by two against the key\ncards, in such a way that any faculty of extra-sensory perception\nwould not have a chance to operate. The results obtained were well\nwithin chance expectation, being, on 7,500 trials only O'S per cent,\naway from the ideal mean value.\na\" joint paper by ]\\Ir J. L. Woodruff and Professor R. W. George\ndescribes work on the various methods of card guessing, with a view\nto discovering which method was the easiest for the subject to obtain\na result above chance. Methods were tried in which the subject\npointed to key cards which were face upwards, the same with the\nkey cards face downwards, and also with the subject verbally\nindicating his choice instead of pointing to a key card. All three were\nrepeated with the cards to be guessed totally screened from the view\nof the subject. The experimenters obtained significant results with\nall methods, and they found that the method where the key cards\nwere face upwards and the cards to be guessed unscreened produced\nthe highest total score, the lowest total score being given by the\nmethod of key cards face downwards and the cards to be guessed\nscreened from view. With two subjects it was found that the un-\nscreened experiments produced in all better results than the screened\nexperiments, but with the third subject the opposite was the case.\nDr Carpenter and Professor Phalen contribute a paper on experi-\nments made with college students in order to test Dr Rhine's results\nin an independent laboratory. As well as the usual cards, cards with\ncolours instead of symbols were used. With a few subjects significant\nresults were obtained, it being found that the coloured cards were\ngenerally as effective as those with the symbols. The authors are\nnot, however, prepared to conclude that the results are due to any\nsupernormal faculty.\nDr Warner and Mrs Raible provide an interesting paper on tele-\npathy experiments. Subjects were asked to lift two weights and to\nsay if the second was heavier or lighter than the first. It was found\nthat the number of successes was greater when the experimenter\nknew the correct answer than when he did not. In the case of two\nsubjects the difference was very marked.\nDr D. K.

In consequence the Society will not \u00bb\nonly be exempt in the future, but will recover, it is hoped, several\nyears' payments of tax, a very material relief to its financial position.\nAt the hearing in July the President, Lord Kayleigh, Dr T. W.\nMitchell, the Secretary and the Hon. Secretary gave evidence as to\nthe scientific aims and methods of the S.P.R., and as to its financial\ndisinterestedness. The crucial point was whether the Society's work\nwas of substantial benefit to the pubhc, and on the evidence before\nthem, particularly the evidence as to the important contribution to\npsycho-therapy arising from the Society's researches, the Special\nCommissioners held that it was.\nThis important success is very largely due to Miss Newton's\nenterprise and tact. She carefully explored the ground by interview\nand correspondence, satisfied herself that the Society had a good\ncase, inspired the Council and ofiicers with her own confidence, and\ndid all the preliminary work essential to the success which has now\ncrowned her efi^orts.\nW.

W. S. Irving)\nIn this case information given as evidence is, largely, known either\nto the sitter, Mr Irving, or to Mrs Whitehead, mother of the late\nMrs Irving (\" Dora \"). The point of interest is in what way the\nvarious ideas and images presented in evidence could have become\ninvested with the necessary mental energies to bring them to expres-\nsion at the sittings and to produce the impression of a coherent aim\non the part of two communicators ;\nand, in particular, what energies\nand motives could have worked in opposition to a distinct resistance\nin Mr Irving's mind.\nOwing to a family difficulty which will not be particularised in\nthis report, certain relatives of the late Mrs Irving's had not been\na welcome subject to Mr and Mrs Irving during their married life,\nand, as will be seen, Mr Irving was firmly convinced when first\nannotating the sittings that allusion by \" Dora \" to this branch of\nher family was outside the bounds of probabihty. None the less,\nsuch allusion clearly appears to be made, and was sufficiently visible\nto me, as an outside commentator, to enable me to see the probable\nbearing of a piece of evidence which Mr Irving had not elucidated.\n(The \" Seymour \" incident, given later.)\nNow, it is possible that a group of ideas which is, by habit, un-\nwelcome to the conscious mind of a person may be the more active\nin the subhminal regions of his mind : in this case, that relatives\nwhom Mr Irving consciously wished to forget would constitute a\nsubject that his subliminal mind would actively dwell upon. There\nis little reason, however, for conjecturing that the subject would\nhave been active at all in any region of Mr Irving's mind. The\nrelatives were his late wife's, not his own, there was no current\nproblem concerning them, nor had there been anything for years\n\f112 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1937\nthat induced Mr Irving to trouble about them one way or another.\nThe only conceivable stir to his subliminal feelings on the subject\nmight have been occasioned by the death of the late Mrs Irving's\nfather, Mr Whitehead, in the autumn of 1936. Mr Whitehead\nappears as a communicator in the material we are about to study.\nMr and Mrs Whitehead did not share Mr and Mrs Irving's feeUng\nabout the relatives in question, and it is imaginable that Mr Irving\ncould have subliminally conceived the idea that Mr Whitehead, after\nhis death, would encourage in \" Dora \" a change of attitude on the\nsubject. We should then have to suppose, if we are to make Mr\nIrving's subliminal activities a sufficient explanation for what\noccurred at the sittings, that he conveyed this unconscious idea\ntelepathically to Mrs Leonard's mind, in opposition to the resist-\nance which we shall see to have been present in his known system\nof thought and opinion.\nThe process would be like that by which a dream forces into\nexpression some mental attitude which is foreign to, and unwelcome\nto, the conscious attitude of the dreamer ;\nonly in this case the\nexpression has to be activated not in the person's own dream-mind,\nbut in the trance-mind of another person, the medium.\nSuch a hypothesis, while highly conjectural, is not without interest.\nAssuming that the process is possible at all, the chief difficulty that\nI see in this case lies in attributing sufficient energy to the supposed\nunconscious motivation in Mr Irving's mind. Dream-analysis sug-\ngests that it takes a great deal of psychic energy to force a subject\ninto dream-expression against which there is an organised resistance in\nconsciousness. Presumably more psychic energy would be required to\nneutrahse a resistance and then to activate expression through the\ntrance-mind of a medium. But we can return to hypotheses of\nenergy and motive when we have seen what are the facts in this case.\nI. Concerning \" Australia.\n\"\nExtract from a Leonard sitting of Jan. 19, 1937 ;\nsitter, the Rev.\nW. S. Irving, taking his own notes in duplicate. The carbon copy\nof these notes was posted on the same day from Whitstable to Miss\nNewton at the S.P.R. rooms, to preclude any adaptation of the\nrecord to subsequent findings.\nMrs Leonard's control, Feda, speaking :\n\" Now, Mr Bill, Dora says she isn't only interested in Aus-\ntraha just now, but someone she knows went to Australia some\ntime ago. 'Related,' she says, 'related,' Mr Bill. Is a 'G'^\niThis initial is changed to accord with a necessary pseudonym.\n\fOCTOBEE 1937 Case 113\nanything to do with it. Keep seeing a big '\nG ' while she's\ntalking about this. An '\nS '\nand a '\nG '\ncome together rather\n\u2014\n'\nS '\nand '\nG '. Are there two fairly youngish people connected\nwith this? She would be really interested in one more than in\nthe other. Not boys and girls\u2014not young as that ;\ngrown-up\npeople. That's right, Mr Bill, do you see? There's a reason\nfor her mentioning this just now, Mr Bill, about Australia and\nthe '\nS '\nand the '\nG ', 'cos something is happening making a\nchange for the one she's interested in. Please put it down!\nAnd Dora is helping\u2014Dora is helping just noAV in this matter,\nyou see? That's right, Mr Bill, that's right! Now Dora feels\na little bit of excitement and arranging\u2014movement, change,\nall round this condition. Mr Bill! She feels something very\ngood\u2014very good. Not very long ago, there was something\nrather worrying there, wasn\"t there, Mr Bill? Dora felt there\nwas. She felt '\nOh dear! I wish things could be better! '\nAny-\nhow, a little later on you be {sic) in touch with conditions you\ncan find out about this.\n\" Don't put this on one side! It's rather good! I want you\nto follow it up, because, she says, there's someone, on the other\nside, with her now, who used to be a kind of link\u2014important\nlink and the two of them will both help you to verify this, you\nsee?\n\"\nMr Ir\\ang's annotations on this mentioned, first, a friend with\nthe initials \" S.G.\" who had gone to live in Austraha some 34 years\nago. This does not seem relevant (\" An S. and a G. come together\nrather \" would be meaningless), and, as Mr Irving remarks in his\nannotation, the word \" related \" (which Feda emphasises by repeti-\ntion) would not apply. Mr Irving's notes continued :\n\" There was, however, at this time, another '\nG ' in Australia, and\none who is related to Dora. This '\nG ' is undoubtedly referred to\nby a new communicator, Dora's father, on Jan. 21, 1937. On the\nother hand, I do not think that this lady is referred to here. I\ncannot imagine Dora mentioning her under any circumstances,\nwhereas\u2014it would be in character for Mr Whitehead (Dora's\nfather) to thrust her forward.\"\nAllusions to this lady appear later to be evidential. We can\nobserve in the above annotations how positive a tabu seems to have\nexisted in Mr Irving's mind against the name in question. A further\npoint about this is that it involves a great improbability of Mr\nIrving's having mentioned the \" G \" relationship in any casual\n\f114 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1937\nconversation he may have had with Mrs Leonard before or after a\nsitting, during the long period over which the Irving-Leonard records\nextend.\nIn this sitting of Jan. 19, 1937, the surname of a neighbour of\nMr Irving's was correctly given ; this gentleman has lived in Aus-\ntralia, and the fact seems to be the point of the allusion.\n\/\/. Evidence concerning a new communicator\n\" The purported communicator \", Mr Irving writes, \" is Dora's\nfather, Mr R. W. E. Whitehead, who died in the autumn of 1936.\nThe messages are for his wife on earth. Nothing was said to the\nmedium as to communications being wished for, and only what\nis given below to the controls.\"\nMr. Whitehead was nearly 84 ; his widow is 84.\nExtracts from a Leonard sitting of Jan. 21, 1937. Mr. Irving\nagain sat alone, and his arrangements with regard to notes and the\ntransmission of a copy to the S.P.R. w^ere the same as for the sitting\nof Jan. 19, 1937.\nFedA :\n\" Before she go any further she want to mention the\nname Seymour to you\u2014Seymour, Seymour. Mr Bill! You'll\nknow she's not often certain whether she's getting something\ngone, or something about to come, well! that's how she feel\nabout this name, so, Mr Bill, will you just keep it in mind '\nfor\nimmediate reference ', she says, '\nfor immediate reference '\n?\nShe feels that name in front of you, with you, near to you,\nnow. Seems some connexion between that name and another\n\u2014wait a minute\u2014another name, which she can't give me this\nmoment but she will. It's connected with somebody, some-\nbody who's passed over lately, Mr Bill, lately.\"\nIt is a fact in evidence that Mr Irving sought with care for associa-\ntions to the name Seymour, and found only that when an acquaint-\nance of his died early in 1937 there was a Seymour among the\nnumerous mourners. This seemed of no interest ; and Mrs White-\nhead connected nothing with the name.\nBy this time a probabihty had become clear to me that the name\nconnected with the letter \" G \", above, which will be here repre-\nsented by the name Gurnard, was, despite Mr Irving's resistance to\nthe idea, an allusion intended both by Dora and by the new com-\nmunicator. The reasons for this will appear later in these extracts.\nI wrote suggesting to Mr Irving that he might find \" Seymour \" to\nbe in some way connected with the Gurnard-Austraha theme. Mr\n\fOCTOBEE 1937 Case 115\nIrving thought of searching in an old birthday-book^ which had been\ngiven to Dora when she was 10 years old by Mrs Gurnard.\nAmong the entries in this book, the name immediately preceding\nMrs Gurnard's own is\n\" May Seymour \". Note that Feda had said,\nof the name Seymour, \" Seems some connexion between that name\nand another . . . which she can't give me this moment but she will.\nIt's connected with somebody who's passed over lately.\" As will\nbe seen, the name Gurnard was effectually given later.\nFeda goes on (in the sitting of Jan. 21, 1937) to speak of a man,\n\" here with Dora \", \" what's passed over rather lately \". \"A\nman ; not a boy.\" \" And there's a lady on the earth waiting for\nsome news of him.\"\nWe can say only that this contains nothing inappropriate to old\nMr Whitehead : a man, adult, lately deceased. I gather that Mrs\nWhitehead had not, in fact, had \" news \" of him hitherto.\nFeda next says :\n\" Mr Bill ! Will you see if there's anything connected with\nsomething-field? Freshfield, Greenfield, something hke that\nconnected with this man? ... I dunno what Dora means, but\nshe says, '\nThere's an objective in front of it.' . . . Dora says,\n'\nNo, it's an adjective in front of the field.'\n\"\nMrs Whitehead writes :\n\" The '\nfield '\nis Fairfield, the firm he\nworked with so long.\" Mr Irving adds : \"I think it practically\ncertain that I must have known about Mr Whitehead's connexion\nwith the Fairfield Company, years ago, but until I read Mrs\nWhitehead's notes, I had forgotten.\"\nTwo initials are then given by Feda as \" coming with \" the com-\nmunicator, which would be correct for the Christian names of a\nbrother and daughter of the communicator, both deceased. Initials\nalone add httle as evidence, and I merely note that these might\nhave furnished a negative point instead of a faintly positive one.\nFeda then refers to the communicator's health : he was\n\" not well \", and \" He was failing too in his bodily condition for\nsome time, but he passed over rather quickly just at the end\nlike, a sudden faihng\u2014a sudden stopping.\"\nMr Irving notes that Mr Wlutehead was, at the end of his life,\n\" being treated for a weak heart. Nevertheless, he had a good\n^At a Leonard sitting of July 22, 1937, Mr. Irving was given an allusion to\na picture or design of an owl at his home which should remind him of Dora.\nHe found a picture of an owl, with a short poem called \" The Owl's Advice,\"\nin the same birthday-book, on the back of the page containing Dora's birthday.\n\f116 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1937\nbreakfast on the day of his death, and seemed no worse than\nusual. Mrs Whitehead left him alone for a short time, and when\nshe returned found him dead.\"\nFeda next refers to \" a place . . . River, or something-river.\"\nWe shall come later upon a reference to Hull, properly Kingston-\nupon-HuU, where the Hull joins the Humber. Mrs Whitehead\nwrites, \" I think the Humber is the river.\" We can say that this\nallusion keeps within sight of relevance.\nFeda then describes the communicator as \" a clever man and\ndescrilDes him as \" in a garden looking at things growing \". She\ngoes on to his \" examining something . . . something to do with\nNature, and a kind of occupation. . . . Did he examine things\nthrough a glass?\n\"\nFor the \" garden \" reference, Mrs Whitehead can only annotate\nthat \" He was much interested in the gardens opposite \" ; but for\nthe further reference she adds, writing to Mr Irving, \" You know\nAstronomy was one of his pet subjects.\" It seems possible that an\nallusion to astronomy and the telescope was intended, though Feda's\nimpression rather suggests botany and the magnifying glass.\nSpeaking of \" the lady who is left behind on the earth \", Feda\nsays the communicator is \" giving me a feeling she is not too well,\nor too strong \". Feda seems to get no suggestion of the advanced\nage of Mr and Mrs Whitehead. Mr Irving annotates that Mrs White-\nhead is \" naturally '\nnot too strong '. She is seldom really well now.\"\nFeda :\n\" Now I feel this gentleman had links with a place\naway from London\u2014a journey away\u2014not just outside : Ho\n\u2014\nHull\u2014HuUit\u2014Hallit\u2014Hilhard\u2014Hull. I'm getting a name like\nHull.\" (W.S.I. : \"Spell it.\") \" H, 0, L, I think, or H, A, L\u2014\nlike that! That must be part of a name that's 'portant to him.\"\nMr Irving annotates :\n\" When I first met Mr W., he was living\nat Hull . . . the family had lived there many years. ... I asked\nFeda to spell the word, not because I was doubtful of what was\nsaid, but for confirmation. The result Avas curious, and at first\nsight looks like a mistake, but I do not think it is. Soon after\nI got to know the Whiteheads, Mr W. gave up his own business\nin Hull, and went to live in London where he became a member\nof the firm of Lyne and Holman\u2014solicitors. It looks as if his\nmind was dwelhng on this, and it became recorded.\"\nMrs Whitehead wrote to Mr Irving :\n\" It is remarkable that\nHull is mentioned. . . . Hull is almost convincing altho' '\nHoi\n'\nis very near to '\nHolman '.\" It is, of course, quite consonant with\n\fOctober 1937 Case 117\nthe ordinary working of trance- or dream-association that \" Hull\n\"\nshould lead on to \" Hoi \" as \" part of a name \". It is easy, we\nmay note, to be uncertain from the sound whether a name begins\nwith \" Hoi \" or \" Hal \". I am uncertain at this moment whether\nan acquaintance of mine spells her name Holford or Halford.\nFedA :\n\" And '\nGur ', or Gurn-something,^ too. That's\nanother name linked up with him :\n'\nGur ', or Gurn-something.\"\nMrs \"Whitehead writes :\n\" '\nGur ' I think is Gurnard ... as Janet\nGurnard [daughter of the Mrs Gurnard who gave the birthday-\nbook] is in Australia and strange to say Mr W., before his death,\ntalked a lot about his song called '\nAustraha '\n\u2014how he would\nlike to convert it to other music. Janet Gurnard has been in\nAustraha a good many years now. ...\"\nMr Irving aimotates : \"I met some of the Gurnards more than 30\nyears ago. They are people in whom my wife and I had no interest.\nIt is quite likely that Mr, or Mrs, Whitehead has mentioned to me\nabout Miss Gurnard going to Australia, but I am not certain.\"\nThe fact was, as stated above, that Mr and i\\Irs Irving, in the latter's\nlifetime, had not wished to have anything to do with the Gurnards, for\npersonal reasons. Mr and Mrs Whitehead, it appears, had made some\nattempt to modify this attitude, and had not succeeded. Mr Irving's\nannotation, quoted earher, \" I cannot imagine Dora mentioning her\nunder any circumstayices \" refers to this Janet Gurnard simply as one\nof the family who were under this personal tabu. Mr Irving, on later\nconsideration of the evidence contained in these sittings, came to\nthe conclusion that this Gurnard-tabu was not unlikelv to have been\ndissolved in Dora's mind, after her death, and especially after the\nre-union with her father which is part of the hypothesis we are\nconcerned with. I can add on this point that no question of any\nlowering of principle would be involved, and that the \" tabu\n\"\nreflected ia no way on the character of the Gurnards.\nIt will have been noted that Mrs Whitehead's annotation adds\nto the group of \" Australia \" associations which are connected with\nthis case. Apropos of the song \" Australia \" Mr Irving, also a\nwriter of songs, sends the foUowiag note : \"It was only a few days\nbefore ]\\Ir Whitehead's death that I sent him my song '\nLove's\nDawn '\nto see, and Mr W. told me he kept whisthng the tune all\nday. This would naturally make him think, of his own songs, and\nbring the subject up. Mr Whitehead wrote many songs. ... I do\n1 Altered to suit the pseudonj'm. The alteration represents the exact degree\nof accuracy in Feda's partial rendering of the real name.\n\f118 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1937\nnot remember '\nAustralia '.\" This song would be among the things\nthat Mr Whitehead had in mind (by Mrs Whitehead's evidence)\nshortly before his death, and the hnk between himself and Mr Irving\nas fellow song-writers had been (by Mr Irving's evidence) newly\nrevived at about this time.\nFeda goes on to another point\n:\n\" Did he have to bend over something a lot? I feel at one\ntime he had to concentrate, and bend over something a lot.\nWhat you keep in boxes? He used to collect boxes : careful\nhe was with these boxes too. Kept them in one special room,\nseveral of them ;\nand, I think, like numbered so that he would\nknow which was which.\"\nMrs Whitehead refers this to \" the books and boxes that he was\nlatterly busy with \", and the reference may connect this with the\npassage that immediately follows in the sitting, which will be\nquoted in a moment. But the main interest seems to he in Mr\nIrving's annotation : \"At one time my wife and I stored for him,\nhere, about 30 boxes and packages all carefully numbered. Every\nfew weeks, Mr W. used to send messages, '\nPlease get so-and-so\nout of box 27, or package 35.'\u2014We thought it, at the time, an\nawful nuisance!\n\"\nIf this relevance was intentional, it seems to have been worked\nin without Feda's intention, since she appears to be depicting action\nby the communicator only. She continues upon the same line of\ndescription :\n\" What have boxes to do with books? I get books and\nboxes. Did he have glass cases, or glass cupboards? I've\ngot to say it this way : I get him peering through a glass top,\nor door\u2014like a lid or door to something. He had books, this\nman had, a good many books. Oh! Had he been? Yes, he\nhad been doing something about books only short time before\nhe passed over. Something he'd been writing, Mr Bill, writing ;\nfeel as if he was writing something about a book.\"\n\" Writing something about a book \" seems to be an attempt of\nFeda's to supply a connexion between \" writing \" and books ;\nthis\nhas no support from the annotations. But Mrs Whitehead writes :\n\" He was much concerned about all his books and papers, and kept\ngoing to the bookcase, which has glass doors, and peering in and won-\ndering what was going to become of them all. . . . He was writing too\na lot and making his will, and also to help me make mine.\"\nIt will be noted that if Feda had this picture, she impairs it some-\n\fOctober 1937 Case 119\nwhat by the alternative picture of the communicator peering down\nthrough a glass lid. It is possible to suppose, here, that the pre-\nceding picture of the communicator bending over boxes has led\nto an overlapping and confusion of images. In \" glass cases or\nglass cupboards \", \" glass top or door \", \" hke a lid or door \", each\nphrase first gives the idea of a Hd and then that of a door. Feda\nmay also have an echo in mind of \" Did he examine things through\na glass? \"\n(p. 116), where she appears to visuahse some kind of\nNature-study, but the annotations show that astronomy would be\na relevant subject of allusion.\nMr Irving notes that he, as sitter, was ignorant of Mr White-\nhead's habit, shortly before his death, of peering through the glass\ndoors of the bookcase, and adds :\n\" I only once visited the White-\nheads at the house where he died, and that was for half a day only,\non Sept. 17th 1936\u2014most of which time we spent on Bournemouth\npier. It does not seem possible, therefore, that I can have learnt of\nthese habits of his.\"\nFeda then produces one definite mishit, by introducing one of the\nrare Leonard cliches.\n\" He couldn't have had a lot of children, could he? I don't\nthink he'd a terrible big family, but there's a lot of people he\nlooks on as his children, '\nI must think of my children, how\nI can help them.' And I don't think he means his physical\nchildren\u2014his family.\"\nThis is a further touch of positive evidence in so far as Mr White-\nhead was the father of a family (five girls, of whom two now sur-\nvive), but it seems to be a wholly negative point that he is repre-\nsented as having some preoccupation with \" children \" in another\nsense, such as the pastoral or the pedagogic. Judging by a small\ngroup of similar instances in Leonard sittings, a blind shot in this\ndirection seems now and then to be taken when the communicator\nis felt to have been an elderly and kindly person. I find it sur-\nprising, as I have noted elsewhere, that there are not more such\nstereotypes in the general run of Leonard material.\nFeda continues : \"He likes you, but I think he's making use\nof you. (You'd better stop him.) No! It's important! And\nDora says, '\nYes, and substantiates my evidence.' He's going\nto say no more. He thinlv you've got quite a lot to go on -nath\n\"\n(W.S.I. \" Give him my love.\") \" Mr Bill! He's got quite a nice\nfeeling to you\u2014a warm one, it's very nice, Mr Bill. He's given\nme such a nice comfortable warm feeling from him to you.\"\n\f120 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1937\nFeda's impression can be put down to the sitter's attitude, but\nMr Irving notes it as a fact concerning himself and Mr Whitehead\nthat, \" He and I were on very friendly terms. I hked him im-\nmensely.\"\nThere seems to be some evidential force in Feda's and the com-\nmunicator's expressed feehng that material of value has been got\nthrough, and there is some interest in the phrase (which Feda mis-\nunderstands, or makes a play of misunderstanding) about \" making\nuse \" of Mr Ir\\ang. It certainly decreases the probability of an\nevidential sitting being a string of lucky chances when the com-\nmunicators convey their impression, before verification is attempted,\nthat the evidence will be found good. How do they know, on any\nhypothesis of chance? And it seems to be seldom that such a claim\nis made at Leonard sittings, without there being something in it.\nExtracts from the \" Personal Control'', by \" Dora\", which\nfollowed at the same sitting :\n\" You did know w^ho it was I brought this morning? \" (W.S.I.\n\"Yes.\") \"He wanted to come.\" O^.S.I. \"Can you say? \")\n\" You know why I gave '\nGur '? That's very important. It\nisn't quite right as I've given it\u2014it isn't complete. Keep it as\n'\nGur ', for that is part of it. . .\n.\"\nHere followed talk on other matters for nearly 15 minutes. Then :\n\" There's quite a lot been happening about my family lately.\nYou know why I'm saying it? It's all relevant to what I said\nearher in the sitting. It will be all to the good. You know what\nI'm talking about ? It's the personal things you can't talk about.\nIt will mean a readjustment of two lives especially. Do you\nknow why I'm bringing in Australia?\" (W.S.I. \"No.\")\n\"Something connected with Australia connected with this.\nYou know there's been a passing lately in connexion with this.\"\n(W.S.I. \" Yes.\") \" I must put it any way to get it through.\nI tried to make it easy before\u2014to prepare people. I can't say\nany more about it. . .\n.\"\nThe \" Gur \" reference in the first extract is, of course, to the\n\" Gur or Gurn-something \" mentioned on p. 117. Mr Irving notes :\n\" There is, however, the important addition here that Dora's\n'\nfamily '\nis concerned.\" The mention of Dora's family does not,\nit will be noted, occur in context with the \" Gur \" allusion, but\nseparated from it by an interval of a quarter of an hour's talk ;\nit\n\fOCTOBEE 1937 Case 121\ndoes, however, occur in context with, the inquiry whether the reason\nfor alluding to Austraha has been understood. It is to be noted,\nfrom Mr Ir\\'ing's \" No \", that he is quite in the dark about this at\nthe time of the sitting. The connexion between the name Gurnard\nand Austraha has been indicated above ; and there is evidence that\nINIrs Whitehead had recently had this connexion brought to mind,\nfor she -writes to Mr Ir%'ing :\n\"... a lady friend just lately called\nto say goodbye to me on her departure for New York and eventually\nto Austraha and will probably call on Janet Gurnard at Adelaide.\nTurning to the first passage quoted in this case, from the sitting\nof Jan. 19, 1937, there is a reference to \" two fairly youngish people\nconnected with this\n'\n' ; and again in the last passage quoted above,\nfrom the sitting of Jan. 21, 1937, \" It will mean a readjustment of\ntwo hves especially.\" No e\\ddence is at present available by which\nthe relevance of these remarks can be tested ;\nthey may or may not\nprove to be of interest later on.\nThe points of evidence in this case, good and otherwise, have been\nquoted with a minimum of commentary and in the order in which\nthey occurred at the sittings. Opiiiions wiU vary as to their indi-\nvidual value. But I think only a very strong predisposition to reject\nall paranormal explanations wiU discount the probabiHty that the\n\" Gurnard \" indications, and their association with the \" Austraha\n\"\ntheme, display a mental process of which the origin must be sought\nfor outside the mind of the medium.\nWe considered the possibihty, to begin with, that a subhminal\nregion of Mr Irving's mind could have telepathicaUy imparted to\nthe medium the system of \" Gurnard \" references which we have\nnow been able to examine as they came to utterance. It becomes\nclear that if we can conceive such a subhminal acti\\dty on Mr Irving's\npart as taking place, contrary to a set disposition against the \" Gur-\nnard \" theme which is in e\\ddence within the accessible areas of his\nmind, and as taking place with sufficient energy to impress itself\nupon the medium's flow of thought and speech, we still have a\ncomplication to deal with.\nThe e\\adence tends to show that Mr Ir\\dng knew httle or nothing\nof a number of the points that are woven into the system of Gurnard-\nAustralia allusions. Certain of these points, if we can assume that\nhe might have been faintly aware of them, could have had only a\nvery low energic value in his imagination. On the other hand, a\nnumber of these points could have been active in IMrs Whitehead's\nmind, in connexion with her husband's fairly recent death.\n\f122 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1937\nOn the hypothesis, therefore, that a subhniinal activity on Mr\nIrving's part is responsible for the structural intention suggested\nby the Gurnard-Australia allusions, we have to assume further that\nMr Irving's subliminal self had received telepathically (his evidence\nis that he had not received normally) a number of suggestions on\npoints known to Mrs Whitehead and of interest to her, and had\nwoven these into its network of, by hypothesis, fallacious evidence\nwhich was to be imparted to the medium. This is a theory that\nholds together. It is also, I am bound to point out, a theory Avhich\nheaps one assumption upon another, several of them without the\nbarest evidence of their possibility.\nCan we plausibly suppose that Mrs Leonard's trance-mind ob-\ntained the necessary details by some telepathic urgency from Mr\nIrving's and Mrs Whitehead's minds (or by some prehensive act of\nits own) and itself supplied the structural intention that appears to\nbe shown ? This involves a common and a conveniently vague theory\nof the trance-mind and its powers which a little examination shows\nto have a serious hole in it. Given that the medium has obtained\ncorrect details by telepathy from the living, the chances of her so\nputting them forward as to suggest an intended and a correct\nsignificance are exceedingly small. That which appears in the\npresentation of the details, and in the significance upon which they\nare made to converge, as a communicator's intention, practically\ncannot be provided by the medium alone, without knowledge of\nwhat the communicator's intention would be.\nThis element of intention (if we are right in judging it to be\npresent), and the energies that drive it forward to expression, have\nto come from somewhere. We can conceive some subliminal blend-\ning of minds, in this case Mr Irving's, Mrs Whitehead's and Mrs\nLeonard's, in unconscious telepathic conspiracy to construct a\nfallacious appearance of communicators' intention ; but evidence\nthat so interesting a misdemeanour of minds is in any way possible\nhas not so far come to light.\nThe only unitary hypothesis that covers the ground is that the\nintention observed (I repeat, if it is correctly observed) has its source\nin the communicator-personality, however that personaHty may be\nconceived. It seems to be more useful to try to get some notion\nof the phenomenon presented by this personality\u2014by no means an\neasy matter, or a matter of simple faith\u2014than to hammer on at\nthe construction of complex and ill-evidenced theories in the effort\nto eliminate it. .\n\fOctober 1937 Correspondence 123\nCORKESPONDENCE\nTests for RA2srD0M Distribution\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal\nMadam,\u2014I should like to reassure Mr TyrreU that in my \" Note\non Tests for Random Distribution \" no criticism of Mx Tyrrell's\nspecial apparatus or claims was impUed or intended. I should have\nthought I made it perfectly clear that my object was to show what\nmathematical tests might be employed to discover whether any\ngiven sequence of numbers was or was not a random sequence.\nMr Tyrrell kindly supphed me with a Ust of numbers which I used\nmerely as an illustration. A series produced by any other mech-\nanical contrivance would have served my purpose equally well. It\nis therefore a little beside the point for Mr Tyrrell to speak of my\nfailure to understand the use of his commutator. I was concerned\nwith the hst of numbers in my possession, and not with what the\nUst would become after passing through the commutator.\nI am afraid I am unable to agree with Mr Tyrrell when he goes\non to suggest (p. 102, The Journal, July 1937) that it does not matter\nwhether Zener cards form a random distribution or not, so long as\nthe percipient has no opportunity of taking advantage of the fact.\nIf the packs of 25 are made up d la Dr Rhine so that they contain\nexactly five cards of each geometrical smt, and if the subject does\nnot distribute his guesses randomly over the five suits it is clear\nthat the binomial distribution \\\\dll to a lesser or greater degree\nbreak down, and the formiila for standard deviation will be affected\nto some extent. The problem requires careful investigation and\ncannot be dismissed offhand. To some extent the question has been\ndiscussed in a recent number of the Journal of Abnormal Psychology,^\nto which I could refer Mr Tyrrell, but I hope to deal with the\nproblem more exhaustively in my own forthcoming report.\nAs regards Jlr Tyrrell's own claims, I have had no opportunity of\nseeing his subject produce her results, and I prefer to suspend\njudgment until they can be duphcated in an English psychological\nlaboratory.\nYours, etc., S. G. Soal.\nAn Ostensibly Precognitiate Dream Unfulfilled\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal\nMadam,\u2014I am more interested in the reason for Dr C. D. Broad's\ndream {Journal, June 1937) than the fact that it was unfulfilled.\n1 Kellog : Journal of Ahnormal and Social Psychology, Sept. 1936.\n\f124 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1937\nMost of us had been upset by the necessary abdication of Kmg^\nEdward and in a state of nervous apprehension lest something dreadful\nmight mar or prevent the coronation of King George. I am assuming,\nof course, that Dr Broad shared this fairly common feeling, if so, it is\neasy to understand how this feeluig of dread present in his conscious\nmind might have been dramatized in his dream state.\nIf Dr Broad, when he awakened, had not immediately got up and\nmade a note of his dream it would probably have faded away beyond\nconscious recall.\nj\n' ' Wm. a. Garden.\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal\nMadam,\u2014The only conmients which I would make on Mr Garden's\nletter of July 14th are the following :\n(1) There is no doubt that some\nof my most vivid and unpleasant dreams are determined by anxiety\nabout pubhc affairs. I frequently have such dreams about the country\nbeing engaged in war and subjected to aerial bombardment. Two\nextremely vivid and distressing dreams within the last few months\nhave contained the crashing of an aeroplane as a detail. (2) No doubt\nI was a good deal worried by the constitutional crisis which culminated\nin Edward VIII's abdication. But I was immensely reUeved when\nthat event took place so smoothly, and I was not consciously worrying\nany further about the monarchy. (3) Judging from my other dreams\nof similar vividness, I think it fairly certain that I should have remem-\nbered the outlines of this one (though I should, no doubt, have forgotten\nsome of the details) even if I had not made a note of it at the time.\nYours, etc.,\nJuly 14th, 1937.

A. T. Fryer\nWe regret to record the death on 23 October of the Rev. A. T.\nFryer, who was one of the oldest members of the Society, his name\noccurring in the first printed fist of Associates {Proceedings 1883).\nMr Fryer took an active interest in the Society's work from the\ntime he became a member. He reported numerous cases, of which\nmany are printed in the Journal, and up to within a year or so of\nhis death\u2014he died at the advanced age of ninety\u2014he kept the\nSociety informed of items of interest bearing on any aspect of psychi-\ncal research which he came across in his general reading, and in-\nvestigated cases which came to his knowledge.\nHe made a prolonged and systematic enquiry into various\nphenomena of psychical and psychological interest connected with\nthe Welsh Revival of 1904-5 : the results were pubhshed in Pro-\nceedings, Vol. xix.\nTHE ORIGINATING MIND IN EVIDENTIAL\nTRANCE MESSAGES\nBy The Rev. C. Drayton Thomas\nAlthough the Society for Psychical Research designedly refrains\nfrom making official pronouncements on the source of mediumistic\ncommunications, indi\\'idual members might welcome an oppor-\ntunity for stating their opinion. Comparatively few are able to\nattend the monthly meetings and the Journal is therefore the sole\nmeans by which they can contribute to our discussions and exchange\nviews.\nWould it not be helpful if members expressed their reasoned\nopinion upon the significance of phenomena, mental or otherwise,\nwhich came to the notice of those actively engaged in research and\nwhich were from time to time inserted in the Journals\nThe last paragraph of Mr Kenneth Richmond's highly interesting\nreport in the October Journal seems to imply such an invitation.\nThe following cases would, I think, provide some further material\nfor an inquiry upon the originating mind, or communicator-per-\nsonahty, in veridical trance utterances. I should be interested to\nlearn what is thought about these incidents by those who do not\nshare my conviction that one can receive information from discarnate\npersons.\n\fNovember 1937 Originating Mind in Trance Messages 127\nThe Approaching Death of Old Acquaintances foreseen hy\nCommunicators while entirely unsuspected hy the Sitter\nDr Arthur T. Shearman\nOne of my early friends was Arthur Shearman. He presently took\nthe degree of D.Lit., and worked in connection with the London\nUniversity. A few years after his wife's death he retired to the Isle\nof Wight. We contimied to exchange Christmas cards, but rarely\ncorresponded. He knew of my interest in Psychical Research but\nexpressed no interest in it. I last saw him in June 1931.\nTo my surprise, he was mentioned in my Leonard sitting of\n26 June, 1936, by my sister Etta. She had known him well and had\nbeen on intimate terms with his wife. At this sitting Etta told me\nthat Arthur's wife wished me to take a message for him, yet not to\nsend it until I should hear from him, which she was confident I\nshould presently do.\nTowards the end of September there arrived a gift from Arthur,\nhis latest volume of Poems. When writing to thank him I enclosed\nthe above message explaining how it came to me.\nThis message, taken down on 26 June, was about 650 words in\nlength, and contained reminiscences which I knew to be correct,\ntogether with some six statements about which I knew nothing.\nOf the latter the following looked the most interesting because it\nclaimed that Arthur's wife was able to observe her husband's\noccupation ; I give it as received from Feda, the Control.\n\" She has been helping him lately over something rather\nimportant that she would be interested in ; three days ago\nfrom today she would be concerned in this matter, trying to\nmanipulate and influence something in a happy and right way.\nThree days ago she was doing it.\"\nIn his reply, dated 3 October, 1936, Dr Shearman gave his\nopinion of the evidence as follows: \" This is immense! The chief\nmatter of the declaration is so direct, and the touches are wonder-\nfully accurate. . . . There is scarcely anything that is doubtful. . . .\nI should have pounced on anything that would not bear investiga-\ntion. I am bound and glad to say that in my judgment proof is\nestablished. Against three (uncertain items) I could point out\nthirty-three things that are true. I did not look forward to a\nrevelation so really important from a scientific point of view and as\nwelcome to myself as this is.\" In reference to the above statement\n(' Three days ago from today,\" etc.) he wrote ;\ni2\n\f128 Journal of Society for Psychical Resmrch November 1937\n\" June the 26tli was a day when I was doing something\nimportant, as the printers had made an unfortunate mistake\nin my Poems, and I had to see that the matter was corrected.\nThree days before the 26th I should be waiting for the com-\npleted edition that contained the mistake. During the preced-\ning weeks I had been correcting the proofs of the Poems. Of\ncourse my wife was always well up in Poetry and was interested\nin my work.\"\nIt looks as if, as not infrequently happens, the communicator was\ninexact as to the precise time of the happening.\nNote that this man had specialised in logic. By his Will he left\nmoney \" To University College, London, to found a course of lectures\non Symbolic Logic and Methodology,\" the lectures to be called\n\" The Shearman Lectures in Symbolic Logic and Methodology.\"\nDr Shearman's letter also indicated features in the message which\nwere characteristic of his wife, and inquired under what circum-\nstances I had received the communication. We exchanged letters\nabout this; he made no allusion to his health and I had no reason\nto suppose that he was in anything but perfect physical condition.\nIt is important to add that, in addition to the long message for Dr\nShearman, I received strict injunctions not to tell him that there was\na special reason why it was being given now. Etta said that his wife\ndid not wish to suggest to liim that he needed help. Her actual\nwords were :\nFeda : \"I think there is some reason for her wishing to help\nArthur himself, but don't say anything about this part, just\nkeep to yourself what she is saying now. She feels he needs\nhelp himself, but doesn't wish to say that to him. She doesn't\nwant to suggest that there is something that needs help. She is\nbeing rather careful. This lady would be rather careful about\nwhat she did and said.\"\nOn my reporting at the next sitting that Arthur was impressed by\nthe message, Etta remarked, \" It may help him. It is the right time\nfor it. There have been things happening that you don't know\nanything about with Arthur, developments.\"\nI supposed that this referred to matters touched on in the messages\nand that his wife's aim had been to produce a wholehearted realisa-\ntion of her nearness and her general knowledge of his work and\nsurroundings.\nIn retrospect it appears as if the communication was related to\nArthur's failing health and approaching death, and that while the\nmessage was designed to give assurance of continued affection it\n\fNovember 1937 Originating Mind in Trance Messages 129\nwas not desired to suggest anything that might make him nervous\nor apprehensive.\nDr Shearman, who was about seventy years of age,, died on\n30 January, 1937. On seeing a Press notice of his death I made\ninquiries and learned from the doctor who attended him that \" Dr\nShearman had been aihng for some months from a failing heart.\"\nThus the message I received for him was given at about the time\nwhen Arthur's physical condition was entering its final stage. From\nthe fact that I was enjoined to hold the messages until hearing from\nhim, and that confidence was expressed that I should hear from him\nshortly, it would appear that the communicator was aware of the\nforthcoming pubhcation of the Poems and of his intention to send\nme a copy. This is noteworthy, because I had no suspicion that he\nwas publishing another book, and it was only my receiving a copy\nfrom him which led me to forward the communication. I think,\ntherefore, that my communicators realised from Arthur's health\ncondition that the end was not far distant, and that they took the\nopportunity of cheering him by messages which proved the identity\nof the sender and also (by several evidential touches which are not\nincluded here) her intimate acquaintance with his work and plans\nDr Leonard Hine\nSixty years ago we lived at Baldock, and our most intimate\nfriends there were a family named Hine. Dr Hine's daughter\nmarried her cousin Dr Leonard Hine whom we often met. In sub-\nsequent years I occasionally saw Dr Hine : the last occasion being\ntwenty years ago when I called on him after his retirement to\nHarpenden. He was occasionally mentioned by a mutual friend\nthrough whom I heard of his activity in local affairs and of the\ninterest he took in his garden.\nOn 14 May, 1937, during a Leonard sitting which my Secretary\ntook for me in my unavoidable absence, the name Hind was suddenly\nmentioned. My father said :\nFedA :\n\" Will you ask him (referring to me) to keep a look\nout about a man passing, an elderly or old man passing that he\nhas known that may be rather interesting to him on our side.\nA man that he has known very well indeed, quite elderly,\nyou might say an old man because he is over seventy, and he\nwill be coming in touch with him later on.\n\" While they are talking I see the initial ' M '\nwritten up. He\nmay have some interesting things to say later on.\n\" ffind, ask him {i.e. ask me) if he remembers somebody called\nHind, somebody who has passed over and whom Mi' John sees ;\n\f130 Jour7ial of Society for Psychical Research November 1937\nit is from Mr John's old days. Mr John sees him. Mr John\nmeets so many people that have known him, but the name\nHind will come back to him [i.e. to me).\"\nIn my long experience I have come to reahse that Feda is fre-\nquently unaware whether that which she is about to say is a con-\ntinuation of a previous topic or the commencement of a fresh one.\nIn the present instance I doubt if Feda knew whether the personal\nname had or had not any connection with the previous description\nof an aged man.\nOn reading this record I realised immediately that the name had\nbeen misheard. I doubt if I ever met anyone named Hind, whereas\nthe name Hine had been mentioned in these sittings in 1921 when\nmy father gave messages from Mr Hine, Senr. I assumed that\nFeda or my Secretary had misheard the name, but I did not connect\nit with the previous paragraph. Had I done so I should doubtless\nhave thought of Dr Leonard Hine, but as it was I simply put the\nstatement aside and waited events without speculating on the\nsubject until I saw a Press notice of Dr Leonard Hine's death on\n26 June at the age of eighty-four. I learnt on inquiry that he had\nbeen in failing health for some time.\n\/ can say with confidence that there had been nothing to bring the Hine\nfamily to my mind, nothing to give me the idea that Dr Hine might be\nnear his end. Looking back over my sittings I find that it is sixteen\nyears since my father's previous reference to this family. At that\ntime he gave evidential items said to have been mentioned to him\nwhile in conversation with Mr Hine, Senr., who had then recently\ndied. The greater part of these I was able to verify by questioning\nMr Hine's granddaughter.\nI have coupled this foreknowledge of Dr Hine's passing with that\nof my friend Dr Shearman, but there is an important difference\nbetween the two cases. Messages for the latter were given to me\npersonally, while the references which proved so precisely applicable\nto Dr Hine were not given in my 'presence. They were taken down\nby my Secretary who went alone to this sitting which I could not\nattend. The fact of my absence weakens the force of any suggestion\nthat the information had been subconsciously received by the sitter,\nand, in some mysterious way, read by the medium from the sitter's\nmind. My Secretary who received the messages had not heard of\nDr Hine nor of the family circle to which he belonged.\nAs for the letter \" M \" I do not know what it was intended to\nimply, possibly \"medical\". Had the letter \" N\" been given it\nwould have been doubly appropriate as indicating the name of Dr\nHine's wife and of his house.\n\fNovember 1937 Originating Mind in Trance Messages 131\n(A) Conversation noticed (B) Thoughts perceived\nThe Silver Tea-spoons\nA. At a sitting with Mrs Leonard on 18 June, 1937, my sister Etta\nwhile speaking in direct control, remarked, \" Mother wanted to know\nwhat was the discussion about tea-spoons, not any other kind of\nspoons, but tea-spoons. Was anything said about tea-spoons that\nhad a bearing on mother? \" I rephed that I knew nothing about it.\nEtta then added, \" Mother would like you to ask \". This, like all\nthe sittings, was taken down by a stenographer verbatim.\nOn reaching home I mentioned this matter to my wife but she\ncould not enlighten me. However, when asking our housemaid, she\nlearned that, on the day before this sitting, while cleaning the reserve\nsilver, our under-housemaid had commented on the fact that of the\nlarger silver tea-spoons there were but five and asked if one were\nmissing. The housemaid had replied that we had only five and that\nthey had 'previously belonged to my motJier.\nAfter hearing this 1 took an early opportunity of asking each maid,\nseparately and alone, about this conversation and found that their\naccounts agreed. The under-housemaid told me that she had\nnoticed they were silver because of the lion stamp, and she thought\nthem larger than tea-spoons now in fashion.\nThere were therefore three facts mentioned at the sitting which\nproved on inquiry to correspond to three facts unknown to the sitter\nand which had occurred on the day before the sitting took place.\n1. There had been a discussion about spoons.\n2. They were tea-spoons.\n3. The discussion and spoons related to my mother.\nIt is to be noted that I had no knowledge of this conversation.\n: The only people who knew were the housemaids, residing fifty miles\ndistant from Mrs Leonard ; one of them had never seen her and the\nother had only viewed her in the distance at a pubhc meeting many\nyears before. How would critics explain the emergence of these\ndefinite statements under such circumstances? I presume their\ni\nspeculations would take one or other of the following forms :\n'\n(1) That Mrs Leonard or Feda made an astral visit to our house,\nand had the good luck to happen upon an incident which would serve\nfor mention at a sitting.\n(2) That Mrs Leonard's subconscious activity was able to function\nat a distance of fifty miles and ascertain a casual thought in the mind\nof one or other of the housemaids.\n(3) That the senior housemaid (who knew the dates of my periodic\nvisits to Mrs Leonard) unconsciously broadcast a recollection of this\n\f132 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1937\ntrifling incident while Mrs Leonard, happening to be in tune with\nher, picked it up.\n(4) That I had subconsciously divined the memory in the house-\nmaid's mind and that it had passed from me to the medium.\nNo other suggestion occurs to me excepting that of chance\ncoincidence, and if anyone seriously considers this a likely explana-\ntion I would ask him to consider the following reference to ike same\ntea-spoons given in a Leonard sitting eleven years before, and to note\nthat in twenty years' experience with Mrs Leonard, during which\nI have had four hundred sittings, these are the only occasions on\nwhich spoons have been either mentioned or suggested.\nB. 4 September 1925.\nFeda :\n\" Did your mother wish to give you something silver?\n\"\nC. D. T. :\n\" There is no reason for supposing it, so far as I am\naware.\"\nFeda :\n\" Your father thinks it is something that has been in\nyour mother's thought. She seemed to be thinking, '\nI should\nlike them to have this.' It is something old, and she has had\nit a long time. Will you inquke about it?\n\"\nMy wife and I had that day returned from visiting my mother and\ncould not think to what this might refer. My mother, shortly after\nthis date, gave me a set of silver spoons which had come into her\npossession at the death of her mother thirty years before, and had\nbeen in the family eighty years. I learnt on inquiry that the\nintention had been in her mind for some time. It had not, however,\nbeen mentioned to me nor, so far as I could discover, to anyone else.\nIn my opinion the above hypotheses would be guesses based upon\nguesses.\nC. Drayton Thomas.\nCORRESPONDENCE\nThe Theory of the Subconscious Mind in relation to the\ndiscovery of the schumann concerto as reported in\n\" Horizons of Immortality\n\"\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal\nDear Madam,\u2014The world-wide interest which has been called\nforth by the finding of the Schumann Concerto, as reported in\nHorizons of Immoi'tality, and the comments which have appeared in\nthe press of various countries, make it urgent to explain without\nfurther delay some reasons which prove that neither the conscious\n\fNovember 1937 Correspondence 133\nnor the so-called subconscious mind of any of those taking part in\nthe proceedings could have influenced the actual happenings.\nYour Journal enjoys a central position in the research work which\ndeals with matters of this nature, and I request you kindly to give\nroom to a statement which answers some of the comments.\n1. It ought, in the first place, to be observed that Miss Jelly\nd'Aranyi was almie with a friend, who did not take part later in the\nmessages, at the heralding communication on the concerto in April\n1933. Her sister, Mrs Alexander Fachiri, the spiritually sensitive,\nknew nothing whatever about the experiment until afterwards. This\nis one important point to be kept in mind.\n2. Miss d'Aranyi herself has stated that she knew nothing at all\nabout an unpublished violin-concerto by Robert Schumann and has\nto be taken at her word. Her veracity is proved, though, by two cir-\ncumstances which ought to be kept in mind : (a) Miss d'Aranyi was\nutterly sceptical as to the truth of the message received in April\n1933, and would not take for granted that such a work did exist.\nShe thought, as a matter of fact, that the message referred\nto the \" Fantasia \" by Schumann which rarely is played, but a\nprompt answer came :\n\" No, we mean an unpublished work.\" Then\nshe asked whether it was a good one or not, as reported in Horizons\nof Immortality. If her subconscious mind brought back to her any\nrecollection of such a work, she would instantly have become aware\nthat the Concerto was supposed to be an inferior work and not\ngood for playing. (6) If she had remembered anything at all with\nregard to it, she would also have connected this Concerto with the\nname of Joseph Joachim, although she had not seen him since her\nearly childhood, at the age of nine. But the interesting fact is that\nshe did not think of Joachim. What she did was to look up\nGrove's Dictionary, where she found no violin concerto mentioned\namong the registered works by Schumann, and she left it at that,\nbecoming still more sceptical. (Four years later it was brought to\nher notice that a paragraph in Grove on the Life of Schumann\ndescribed the sought for Concerto.)\nInstructed by a new message she, however, approached Sir Donald\nTovey to get further information. If she had had any thought of\na connection with Joachim she would naturally, without further\ndelay, and in the first place, have asked Joachim's daughter, who\nhved in Oxford and whom she knew well, but it was only after Sir\nDonald had pointed out the connection with Joachim, evidenced\nby Moser's Life of Joachim , that she decided to speak to Mrs Joachim\nat the first opportunity.\nThis point undoubtedly bears out that Miss d'Aranyi had no fore-\n\f134 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1937\nhand knmvledge whatever re this particular Concerto, and also that\nher subconscious mind was not at play.\nTo this ought to be added Miss d'Aranyi's genuine surprise at the\nfirst message, a surprise which can be verified by several persons.\nShe remained sceptical for a long time, and the sequence of messages\nand the dates of correspondence bear out how reluctant she was,\nin fact, to act upon this first message and those that followed.\n3. If Miss d'Aranyi had known anything about this Concerto\nwhich her great-uncle had refused to play\u2014as it was considered by\nhim and by Brahms to be an inferior work\u2014she certainly would\nrather have abstained from searching for it and would not have\nshown any desire to play the Concerto.\nOne cannot but ask why the subconscious mind of a prominent\nartist should invite her to play inferior music? That seems most\nenigmatic.\n4. These points are sufficiently clear to dispose of Miss d'Aranyi's\nconscious and subconscious mind operating, but it has been inferred\nthat her sister, Mrs Fachiri, could have influenced her. What was\nsaid earlier ought to be repeated, that the sister was not present and\nwas totally unaivare of what took place, consequently she could not\nhave influenced Miss d'Aranyi on the occasion in question.\nCould she have done it earlier?\nIf that had been the case her conscious or subconscious mind\nwould undoubtedly have revealed the connection with Joachim and\nMiss d'Aranyi would have acted differently. The fact that Mrs\nFachiri expressed her dislike for undertakings of the kind her sister\nwas engaged in and would have nothing to do with such operations\n\u2014\nwhich can be verified\u2014also demonstrates the disconnection between\nthe two sisters in this matter.\n6. It has further been said in the press that Mrs Fachiri ought\nto have known about the Concerto as she once was a pupil of Joachim,\nhad stayed with him for a long time, and was present at his passing\nin 1907. The fact is, however, that she only stayed with Joachim\nin Berlin for six months at the age of sixteen and never heard him\nspeak of the Concerto, which was a painful memory to Joachim.\nJoachim left no will mentioning the Concerto. The work had\nbeen written about fifty-three years earlier, and, according to infor-\nmation given by Schumann's daughter to Professor Hans Wetzler,\nit had been considered to destroy the manuscript altogether at\na meeting between Klara Schumann, Brahms and Joachim, but\nJoachim expressed on the occasion his wish to keep it as a memento\nof his intimate friend. Obviously Joachim wished to maintain\nsilence with regard to this aberration of his friend, as he thought.\n\fNovember 1937 Correspondence 135\nIf Mrs Fachiri had heard anything from Joachim about the Con-\ncerto, she would certainly have been impressed by his severe verdict\nthat it was an inferior work, not worthy of Schumann's genius, and\nshe would undoubtedly have dissuaded her sister from bothering\nabout it any more.\n7. Another point must also be elucidated, viz. that many people\nknew about the existence of the Concerto. It is quite correct that\nthe composition of the Concerto was known to a certain number of\npeople, though not to Miss d'Aranyi, nor to Mrs Fachiri, as proved,\nand that it was mentioned in two books, but in Moser's Life of\nJoachim and in Grove's Dictionary we are not informed of its fate\nafter Joachim's death.\nIt is a fact, though, that neither such an eminent authority and\nfriend of Joachim as Sir Donald Tovey nor Joachim's daughter in\nOxford, nor Franz V. Mendelssohn, another near friend of Joachim,\nnor Herr Strecker of Schotts Sohne, the weU-known music pubHshers,\ncould give any information. Professor Altmann of the Preussische\nStaatsbibHothek had not seen it himself at the time and declared\nit to be \" gesperrt \" after it had been traced. The deposition of\nthe manuscript was done by Herr Johannes Joachim after the father's\ndeath on conditions that \" his father would have approved of\", he\nwrote. They were apparently verbal, and the authorities had the\nview that it must not even be shown to the public. One had the\nimpression that everybody concerned wished to keep the Concerto\nwell guarded and hidden from the pubhc eye, buried in the vaults\nof the Bibhothek. It is not true either that Adolf Busch had played\npart of the Concerto in Zwickau. Whatever knowledge there might\nhave been of such a Concerto having been composed, its location or\nits continued existence was not mentioned in the books referred to,\nand none of the persons approached had any information to give\nin that respect, which is proved by letters written at the time in\nquestion.\n8. Finally, it must be said that if a subconscious mind had been\nin action it seems very difficult to explain why it took such a round-\nabout way when conveying the message. Could that subconscious\nmind not have acted more directly, rather than take into its service a\nboard, letters and a tumbler? The actual occasion really was rather\ninappropriate also as the two friends sought consolation and\nhad no thought of hearing about some obscure work by a\nmaster who died eighty years ago. A subconscious mind, one is\nsupposed to assume, would have connected its impulses to the state\nof mind of the persons and not bring forth such extraordinary\ntidings.\n\f136 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1937\n9. The fact that Mrs Reginald McKenna and I on separate\noccasions reported that the manuscript found was unfinished and\nthat an incoming message definitely stated that it was quite\ncomplete\u2014which later proved to be the case\u2014cannot be explained\nby any reference to a subconscious mind.\nThe whole argument that a subconscious mind was the instru-\nment for fijiding this Concerto and stating its playability becomes\nmore involved and unsatisfactory the deeper one considers the impli-\ncations, and one is tempted to challenge those who insist on the\npresence of a subconscious mind in the particular case to define\nunambiguously what they really mean by that agency.\nA superficial use of obscure terms must be resisted and plain facts\nadhered to.\nYours faithfully,\nErik Palmstierna.\nLondon, 21 October 1937.\nTHE JOURNAL IS PRINTED FOR PRIVATE\nCIRCULATION\nThe attention of Members and Associates is drawn to the private\nnature of the Journal, from which no quotations should be made with-\nout the previous consent of the Council.

The date\nof the next Meeting will be announced in the January number of\nthe Journal.\nCASE OF APPARENT EXTRA-SENSORY PERCEPTION\nIN THE FORM OF EXTRA-OCULAR VISION\nL. 1310.\nWe print below an account by Dr Warren Coleman of New York of\na remarkable case in which he himself was one of the witnesses.\nAlthough it has not been possible for the case to be as well attested\nas might be wished, owing to the interval of time which has elapsed\nsince its occurrence and to the death of one of the principal witnesses,\nit is printed as being hkely to be of great interest to readers, and m\nthe hope that anyone who may know of similar experiences wiU\ncommunicate with the Research Officer. The date of the occurrence\nwas 1929.\nAccoimt by Dr Coleman, enclosed in a letter to the Society\ndated 1937, May 15.\n\" The following incident appears to be of sufficient importance\nto place it permanently on record. I report it without attempting to\nexplain or even to classify it. I may add, however, that I would have\nbeen loath to beUeve the story if I had not been one of the actors\nin it.\nA woman, fifty-seven years of age, was operated on at two o'clock\nin the afternoon for cataract of the left eye. I called to see her about\nten o'clock the following morning. She was lying on her back in bed\nwith her head low. The single window, facing the east, was to the\nleft (the patient's) of the head of the bed. The day was clear and the\n\f138 Journal of Society for Psychical Resmrch December 1937\nroom was filled with Uglit. I walked to about the middle of the left\nside of the bed and stood there facing the patient. After an exchange\nof greetings, the patient said '\nI can see you '. At first I thought she\nwas joking. Then, to test her statement, I raised my right arm above\nher and asked '\nWhere is my right hand ?\n'\nWithout the least hesita-\ntion or delay she reached up (her arm had been lying beside her) and\nseized my hand with her right hand. There was no groping or\nfumbhng. If both eyes had been open and functioning the act\ncould not have been carried oiit with greater precision. I accused\nher of seeing me under the bandages. She rephed, '\nNo, I am not '.\nUnconvinced, I asked the nurse whether it would be possible for the\npatient to see under the bandages, and she was sure she could not.\nLater the surgeon described the routine following such an operation :\nEach eye is covered with a '\npatch '\n(cotton between two layers of\ngauze) which is fastened in place with adhesive plaster ; over these\na gauze bandage is wrapped and the whole is covered with a black\ncloth mask. Without question the dressings prevented the use of\neither eye.\nThe next morning when I asked the patient if she could see me,\nshe answered '\nNo '\n: she seemed annoyed by the question and\nimmediately changed the subject.\nThe medication the patient received is recorded in detail in the\nevent that it had any influence on the development of the power to\n'\nsee '\nwithout the mediation of the eyes.\nThe morning of the operation 60 gr. of potassium bromide was\ngiven in two doses : just before the operation the left eye was\nanaesthetized by the instillation of six drops of a 1% solution of\nholocain, and movement of the eye during operation was prevented\nby the injection of 5 c.c. of a 2% solution of novocain (the O'Brien\ninjection) : that night she was given \\ gr. (gm. 0.016) of morphine\nsulphate hypodermically.\nThe day nurse who was present during my visits confirms the\nabove account in every particular.\nAlthough I did not witness the following incident I haven't the\nleast doubt that it occiirred as the day nurse related it.\nAt a different time on the morning of my first visit the head nurse\ncalled on the patient. The patient claimed to see her in the corridor\nbefore she reached the door, as she opened the door and after she had\nentered the room. To prove her claim she gave an accurate descrip-\ntion of the head nurse's appearance. The head nurse has since died\nbut she related the incident to others on leaving the room.\nDuring both incidents, it may be noted, an independent witness\nwas present.\n\fDecembeb 1937 Case of Apparent Extra-Sensory Perception 139\nThe patient told her husband that at the time of the head nurse's\nvisit she did not reaUze that her right eye had been bandaged as well\nas the left.\nThe day nurse states also that the patient claimed to be able to see\nfaces and places (places with which she was unfamihar) beyond the\nrange of ordinary vision, and that she had had prophetic visions or\ndreams.\nThe husband states, '\nI have noticed this psychic quality many\ntimes during our married life but never before in such pronounced\nform.' He also tells me that his wife has found that, if she goes\nwithout food for a few days, she develops this power.\"'\nIn answer to inquiries, Dr Coleman has communicated to the\nSociety the name of the patient, and the name of the Surgeon who\nperformed the operation.\nDr Coleman has also sent the following statement by the nurse,\ndated 1936, December 5 :\n\" Very distinctly do I remember when\nyou visited Mrs . Nurse [the Head Nurse] also came in and\nMrs said she saw her, and described her perfectly. The patient\nhad both eyes bandaged and covered with a black mask. I also\nrecall at the same visit that Dr Coleman related a very interesting\nexperience a relative had had during the Civil War.\nThe patient explained to me that she could see forthcoming events\nand places\u2014I should say strange places, and I know that the patient\nwas not under the influence of any medication.\"\nDr Coleman writes :\n\" The accuracy of the nurse's memory is\nattested by her recollection of the incident in my own family, recited\nto the patient.\"\nDr Coleman has also sent the following extracts from a letter from\nthe husband of the patient, dated 1936, Sept. 9 :\n\" She thought at\nthe time that she was seeing you with her right eye and did not know\nthat the right eye was bandaged, as well as the left. The left was the\neye from which the cataract was extracted.\nShe asked me, while her eyes were still bandaged, if Dr\n[the Surgeon] did not have a beard, and I told her '\nNo She said\nthat she seemed to see a beard on his face when he called to treat\nher. This was after the operation and while the eyes were bandaged.\nI could not make out what was in her mind until recently when I\ncalled upon Dr for an examination of my eyes, and noticed that\nhe adjusted over his face what seemed to be a celluloid mask,\nextending to a point below his chin, and in the dark room where he\nwas examining my eyes, he seemed to have a beard. The mask gave\nhim that appearance.\"\nk2\n\f140 Journal of Society for Psychical Eesearch December 1937\nIn connection with the incident of the Head Nurse, the Research\nOfficer asked Dr Coleman if the patient had seen the Head Nurse\nbefore the operation, as, if so, she might have described her from\nmemory. Dr Coleman has sent the following extract from a letter\nfrom the patient's husband, dated 1937, June 21 :\n\" Replying to your note, I beg to state that I do not know whether\nMrs had seen the head nurse before her operation. If the head\nnurse was in her room before she was bandaged for her operation, I\ndoubt if, at that time, Mrs could have recognized her, except by\nher voice. You may remember that when you examined Mrs\nas to her physical condition before Dr operated, the vision of her\nleft eye was entirely obscured, and that of her right eye was so dim\nshe could not recognize me ten feet from her, unless I spoke. I think\nwe would be safe in saying that she had never seen the head nurse\nbefore the operation. I base this upon the fact that she was not\nable to describe to me the physical or facial appearance of Dr\n[the Surgeon] and, as he had examined her eyes before the operation,\nhad she been able to see him, she would have been able to recognize\nhis features.\"\nCORRESPONDENCE\n\" Extra-Sensory Perception \" in the United States\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal\nMadam, Having recently returned from a visit to the United\nStates may I be permitted to offer one or two observations on the\nclaims now being made by certain groups that an alleged human\nfaculty styled extra-sensory perception is now being demon-\nstrated.\nDuring my visit I made a number of inquiries among those persons\nfrom whom I expected to receive varied opinions, and in doing so\nI was able to confirm, modify, or vary views that I had previously\nheld from an examination of the literature.\nFrom this reading I had come to the provisional conclusion that\nthe American investigators were for the most part enthusiastic\namateurs, who unfortunately lacked the necessary training to con-\nduct experiments where the sources of error were both numerous\nand difficult to detect. Thus in the early work described by J. B.\nRhine such elementary precautions as that of using cards of the\nsame size was neglected ; and later work published as recently as\nJune 1 937 indicated that the experimenters have but shght idea of\n\fDecember 1937 Correspondence 141\nthe kind of report which is necessary for scientific men to be able\nto imderstand the work being accompUshed.\nOne day, on visiting a laboratory where work on E.S.P. has been\ndone, I asked to see one of the cards used in the experiments. The\ncard handed to me was a blank card apparently made by some\ncommercial house, and the wavy lines used for the experiments had\nbeen impressed on the blank side by some stamp made of rubber\nor otherwise. The first thing that I noticed about this card, which\nwas, I think, of the type illustrated in the frontispiece to Vol. I,\nNr. 1 of the Journal of Parapsychology, was that the pattern on the\nback was one which was well adapted for use with the well-known\nCharlier method of card marking. In this case, however, such a\nsystem need not have been used by any person so disposed smce\nthe impress of the wavy lines was clearly visible on the back of the\ncard. It is, of course, true that this card might have been the only\none in the United States which had been so impressed and that it\nhappened by chance that this particular card was put into my hand\non the day that I visited the laboratory. Perhaps my friends among\nthe statisticians will like to work it out. Whatever their results\nmay be the experience suggests to me that precautions might be\nstricter than they are. Indeed I have my suspicions that many\nsources of error are overlooked by the innocent investigators. Had\nthe early work in magnetism and mesmerism been subject to the\nsame statistical analysis as E.S.P. in the United States what enor-\nmous odds against chance would have been revealed. But ex-\nperienced people nowadays are inclined to regard the success of these\ntests {i.e. those of the Didier brothers) as probably due to mal-\nobservation on the part of the investigators and to other sources of\nerror.\nIn venturing to make these observations I expect, of course, to\nbe told that such criticisms are irrelevant, since now the subjects\nare not allowed to see or touch the cards, that they are sealed in\nopaque envelopes, or that the subjects are in different rooms, cities\nor states. I will leave these arguments for others to appraise their\nvalue. I confess, to an old hand like myself, they have a famiUar\nring!\nIn conclusion, it is, I think, to be desired that our colleagues m\nAmerica should try to pay a little less attention to the statistical\nanalysis of theii\" results and should try to take the trouble, however\narduous it may be, to train themselves properly to conduct and\nreport the experiments on which they base these analyses.\nYours, etc.,\nE. J. Dingwall.\n\f142 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1937\nStatistical Methods op Investigation of\nTrance Personalities\nDear Madam,\u2014I am filled with admiration for the lucid manner\nin which Professor Thouless has explained the difficult statistical\nmethods employed by Mr Whately Carington in his investigation of\nTrance Personalities. There are, however, one or two points on\nwhich I should appreciate further enlightenment.\nI should like to know whether all words in the lists used are\nassumed to be of equal value. It occurs to me that a long reaction\ntime for certain words should have a higher significance than an\nequally long one for others. On page 233, Prof Thouless points out\nthat \" most people may be expected to give longer reaction times\nto 'dead' in W.W.C.'s list than to 'window'.\" A difference in\nresponse to a word so unexciting as \" window \" seems to me to be\nlikely to have a greater real significance than a similar difference in\nresponse to \" dead \", a word which normally has emotional con-\ncomitants. To put the argument in colloquial terms ; if so dull a\nword as \" window \" makes a subject go all worked up, we naturally\nthink that we have hit upon something rather special, whereas if\npeople get excited when a horrid word like \" dead \" is suddenly\nshot at them it is only what might have been expected and does\nnot necessarily mean anything in particular.\nThe second point on which I feel some difficulty is, as it seems to\nme, even more important, as it bears on the fundamental validity\nof the whole investigation.\nProf Thouless, in explaining the analysis of variance, takes as his\nillustration an enquiry into the egg-laying powers of the hens in\nseven different poultry yards. He shows, with admirable clearness,\nhow the method may be applied and what conclusions may be drawn.\nIn this example there is a precise arithmetical relation between the\ndata available, i.e. the numbers of eggs laid, and the characteristic\nwhich is to be measured.\nWhat I am by no means clear about is whether one is justified in\nassuming, as has been done in Mr Carington's investigation, that a\nsimilar precise arithmetical relation exists between his data, i.e.\nreaction times, and the characteristic which he seeks to measure.\nIf in the data there is the figure 4, are we justified in assuming that\nit should have twice the effect in the calculations of the figure 2 ? If\nthese figures represent numbers of eggs laid, this assumption is\njustified, but is this so when they stand for reaction times?\nTo illustrate my meaning, suppose that the data given in Table I,\n\fDecember 1937 Correspondence 143\npage 237, are somewhat altered, say that Webb's hens give 7, 13,\n14, 7, 4 instead of 7, 11, 11, 7, 4.\nThe average would then be 9. Sum of squares of deviation from\naverage 74. Udev 2\/4 = 18-5.\nAverage of averages = 6-14. Total sum of squares = 140.\nMean i; dev 2\/4 = 5.\nReconstruct Table II with these alterations.\nDegrees of Sum of Mean , ,\ny\nFreedom. Squares. Square. ^\nBetween yards 6 5 x 14-85 = 74-25 12-37 3-546\nWithin yards 28 140 5 3-107\nZ = -439\nThis value for z would still lie just below the level of significance but\nthe difference is so small, viz. -008, that the referee might decide to\nneglect it and reach a positive conclusion. Anyhow it would be\nquite easy with a little judicious manipulation of the figures to get\nan example where the resulting 2 was above significance. My point\nis, would a similar alteration in the figures of reaction times justify\ndrawing a similar conclusion?\nThat Mr Carington himself was not entirely free from doubt on\nthis matter is shown from the fact that he introduced \" certain\ndevices for scahng ... in order to get rid of irregularities caused by\nabnormally long reaction times \" (page 230). If abnormally long\nreaction times are unrehable and have to be scaled down to get rid\nof irregularities, why should normally long reactions times be\nconsidered rehable?\nThe absence of a precise arithmetical relation between the data\nand the characteristic to be measured seems to me to cut away the\nground from under the whole investigation, and to render invalid\nnot only the positive conclusions drawn by Mr Carington, but also\nthe negative onces arrived at by Prof Thouless.\nYours faithfully,\n23 Oct., 1937. H. F. Saltmarsh.\nA Precognitive or Clairvoyant Dream?\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal\nMadam,\u2014My friend, Mr. C. Norfolk, of Manor Farm, Bourton-on-\nthe-Hill, who is in charge of the poultry department of a farm that he\nand his brother manage together, had the following veridical dream\nthree or four nights ago, and recounted it to me today. As it woidd\nappear to be an instance of clairvoyant perception, if not, possibly,\n\f144 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Dbcembeb 1937\nprecognition, I think that should be worth putting on record in the\nSociety's Journal.\nSome time during the night\u2014probably in the early morning, before\nrising\u2014Mr Norfolk dreamed very vividly that he was alone in some\nlarge London building, such as a big old-fashioned hotel, or possibly\na warehouse, and that his brother's herd bull was loose in the building\nwith him. Eventually he escaped into the streets, which were\ndeserted, and ht by the grey light of a misty autumn morning ; but\nhe continued to be chased by the bull. The experience was naturally\nan unpleasant and rather terrifying one, and it left a considerable\nimpression on his mind after awakening.\nThe sequel to the dream was a partial fulfilment, as his brother and\na farm student (who have also attested this account) came up to\nthe farm early next morning from their house lower down the village,\nto find that the bull was actually roaming about the farmyard\n;\nhaving escaped some time during the night from the shed in which he\nhad been shut up recently.\nMr C. Norfolk, the percipient, who sleeps at the farmhouse itself,\nabout a hundred yards from where the bull was loose, is unaware of\nhaving heard or seen anything during the previous night or evening\nthat might have led him to suppose that the animal had broken loose;\nneither had his brother or others on the farm.\nIt should be remarked that there was no apparent reason to expect\nthat the bull should break loose, which it has not done before, and\nalso that Mr C. Norfolk is not personally concerned about the dairy\nside of the business, which is his brother's responsibility.\nThe percipient does not appear to be given to such dreams, though\nhis mother had a rather similar (apparently precognitive) dream a\nfew months ago, regarding a pudding that her servant had made, and\nwhich had failed to turn out as expected or as usual. I was also told\nof that dream at the time, but the circumstances and the rather more\ncommonplace nature of the subject did not appear to justify its\nrecord as any very sure instance of metagnomic percipience. In the\npresent case, however, I am personally satisfied by a careful con-\nsideration of the various factors in the case, and being a next-door\nneighbour of the percipient, that there is very good reason to suppose\neither clairvoyance or, perhaps, even precognition.\nAt the same time, however, it obviously cannot be absolutely\ndenied that the subject miy, conceivably, have heard faint sounds\ndurmg the night, that gave him the necessary sensory clues, though\nsubconsciously. In view of the facts, that the percipient's bedroom\nfaces away from the farm, and at some distance from it, that he was\nnot personally concerned, that there are always such noises on a\n\fDecember 1937 Correspondence 145\ni\nfarm at iiight (assuming them actually to have occurred), and that\n[\nhis mother and other neighbours, who are light sleepers, heard\nnothing peculiar, a normal explanation appears to be improbable.\nThe substantial accuracy of this account is attested by :\nC. Norfolk, Percipient.\nMaurice B. Norfolk, Brother to above.\nGeoffrey Harrison, Farming Student.\nJ. C. Maby, Writer ofaccount.\n6 November 1937\n[Note : This incident, while of sufficient interest to justify printing\nin the Journal, must clearly not be considered as being more than\nfaintly suggestive of paranormal faculty. Pursuit dreams, of the type\ndescribed, are by no means uncommon, and such an incident as the\nescape of a bull from a farm is obviously not so very unUkely as to\nmake the connection with the dream necessarily causal. There is the\nadditional weakness that the dream does not seem to have been noted\nin writing, or reported to a witness before the apparent fulfilment, so\nthat it is possible that the memory of the dream which presented\nitself to the dreamer after the incident took place may be much more\napropos to the actual incident than the dream, as dreamed, really\nwas. This unconscious \" editing \" of dreams is not at all unusual,\nand must be carefully guarded against in all considerations of dream\nmaterial where there is no note made on waking.\u2014C. V. C.

Campbell, D.D.\n(Longmans.)\nIn this book Lady Barrett, M.D., gives selections from her sittings\nwith Mrs. Osborne Leonard during the past eleven years. Canon\nCampbell, an old member of the S.P.R., writes of these records in\nhis foreword :\n\" They are worthy of the serious attention of an intelli-\ngent and cultured pubhc, partly because of their presumed source\nand partly because of their subject matter. These scripts are not\nopen to the reproach of triviality that is so often and so justly\nlevelled against soi-disant spiritistic messages. They can stand the\ntest of critical investigation, and the conditions under which they\nwere produced were of the strictest scientific precision,\"\n\f146 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1937\nSir William Barrett's long association with the Society for Psychi-\ncal Research gives additional interest to the evidence hy which his\nidentity was established. Not only did he give reminders of intimate\nmatters which Lady Barrett wonld at once recognise, but occasionally\nmade statements which were unknown to her at the time of the sit-\nting and which were subsequently found to be correct. On one\noccasion (p. 124) when notes were taken in Lady Barrett's absence\nby her secretary, Sir William correctly mentioned recent incidents\nin Lady Barrett's private life which were unknown to the secretary.\nSir William had been interested in book tests obtained by Mrs\nLeonard's sitters. P. 154 recounts his success in giving such a test\nfrom a book in Lady Barrett's house. Evidences of this and similar\ncharacter are recorded on pages 91, 152, 163, 173, 192 and else-\nwhere.\nIn an epilogue (p. 198) Lady Barrett discusses important but less\ntangible evidence. \" We can and do get a sense of the presence of\nour friend in a way that must be experienced in order to be realised.\nThis sounds the most elusive and deceptive of all modes of recogni-\ntion, yet I have known men of sceptical mind, previously sure that\ntelepathy from the mind of the sitter explains all, become absolutely\nconvinced of their friend's presence in a sitting, though everything\nsaid was already known to the sitter ;\nyet veridical messages given\nthrough a proxy sitter who had no knowledge of their truth or value\nhas carried no conviction to the same person. Such conviction,\nhowever, cannot be passed on to others ; it concerns the individual\nalone who has had the special experience.\" The truth of the above\nremark is confirmed by your reviewer's experience, and many others\nwill agree.\nAs might have been expected, Sir WilUam has inquired into the\nnature of the etheric body, its functions and its relationship to\nphysical health. The following paragraphs (p. 112) are specially\ninteresting. \" I have been investigating the etheric body, that body\nwhich is the intermediate vehicle for this mysterious force. The\nphysical body is not acted upon directly, but always through the\nmediumship of the etheric body. The etheric body is the missing\nlink, and all forms of hfe on earth have their etheric body. Scientists\nhave been puzzled as to the kind of link, if any, which exists between\nthe animating force called life or energy, and that which we call\nmatter. There has been something missing in between and this\netheric counterpart or body is the missing link.\"\nPp. 176-8 offer interesting opinions on the possibiHties of mental\nand spiritual healing, with specific mention of certain factors which\nsometimes limit their effectiveness.\n\fDecember 1937 Reviews 147\nP. 55 describes the communicator's frequent diiSculty with\nmemory during the course of a sitting. These remarks are worthy\nthe particular attention of students. This highly interesting book\ncontains a wide variety of material on which hypotheses about the\nidentity of the originating mind, and the modus operandi of com-\nmunication may be based. There are also descriptions of the hfe and\nenvironment now enjoyed by the speaker. Two brief passages may\nbe quoted here, \" You might think fun is dead on our side. We have\nmore fun than ever we had on earth, but kind, good fun, laughing\nwith people instead of laughing at them.\" \" There are some things\nwe can't tell you about, that are outside the range of your imagina-\ntion. There are experiences one has\u2014if one tried to speak of them\nin ordinary language of earth, it would be impossible.\"\nThese conversations are interspersed with practical advice for the\nenrichment of the inner life.

Price 10s. net.\nAs Baron Palmstierna has already contributed to the November\nJournal a valuable letter in which he discusses in some detail the\nincident of the Schumann Concerto, which has attracted so much\npublic attention, it will not be necessary to do more than indicate\nbriefly the nature of the book which many of our members will cer-\ntainly desire to study. The book which is a record of messages from\n\" the Beyond \" received over a period of several years by an experi-\nmenting group, in which Baron Palmstierna played the part of\nrecorder, does not profess to go into evidence of identity of the com-\nmunicators and similar matters. Not that evidence of this kind was\nabsent from the messages, but the messages expressly forbade the\nauthor to deal with that aspect of them in this book, apart from one\nor two cases mentioned in the final chapter. The main part of the\nbook consists of messages of a theological and ethical kind which, it is\nclaimed, constitute a revelation of importance to the whole world in\nthe present state of unsettled rehgious belief and political unrest.\nThey were received through the instrumentality of Mrs Alexander\nPachiri (Adila Fachiri, the viohnist), and the method employed was a\nvariant of the ouija board. One need hardly add that the author's\nown comments contribute very largely to the interest of the\nbook.\n\f148 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Decembee 1937\nBeyond Normal Cognition. By John F. Thomas, Ph.D. Foreword\nby Professor William McDougall, F.R.S., D.Sc, M.B. (Bos-\nton Society for Psychic Research, Boston, 1937.)\nWe are indebted to the Boston Society for Psychic Research and\nto Dr Thomas for a very careful and elaborate contribution to the\nUterature of proxy sittings. As all our members know, the dif&culty\nof excluding the possibiUty of telepathic communication on the one\nhand, and the medium on the other, has exercised the ingenuity of\nexperimenters to frame various forms of technique by which that\npossibiHty, if it cannot be entirely eliminated, shall be reduced to the\nminimum. One promising form of technique is the proxy sitting in\nwhich care is taken to insulate the medium from all contact with any\nperson having normal knowledge of facts relating to the communi-\ncator. To EngUsh readers the best known application of this method\nis probably to be found in Miss Nea AValker's Through a Stranger's\nHands.\nMr Thomas is no newcomer to the literature of psychical research,\nand he is to be congratulated both on the success he has had with\nMrs Leonard and other mediums and on the present volume, which\nincludes, besides a record of his own sittings, a brief and useful\nreview of the previous literature.\nTHE JOURNAL IS PRINTED FOR PRIVATE\nCIRCULATION\nThe attention of Members and Associates is drawn to the private\nnature of the Journal, from which no quotations should be made with-\nout the previous consent of the Council.

Editor- of The Journal\nMadam,\u2014The incident of the Schumann Concerto in Baron Pahn-\nstierna's book Horizons of Immortality has attracted so much atten-\ntion that features of interest in the main part of the book are hable to\nbe overlooked. The \" author \" of the \" messages \" apparently does\nnot wish liis name to be disclosed, but his ideas are characteristic of a\ncertain school of thought which flourished in the early centuries of\n\fJanuaey 1938 Correspondence 153\nthe Christian Era. The Great One, the \" descending \" hierarchies of\ncelestial spirits, guardian spirits and human spirits, the \" fall \" of the\nsoul at birth, the joyful escape to a Spiritual World at death, the fre-\nquent use of the imagery of hght are all very familiar to students of\nNeoplatonism. Some thoughts, allowing for difference of imagery,\nare very characteristic. For instance, on page 244 the soul is com-\npared to the shell of a clock and the body to the works inside. This\nrecalls Plotinus' suggestion in Enneads IV. 3. 20 that the soul en-\ncloses the body, rather than the body the soul.\nThe \" Messages \" profess Christianity, but of an unorthodox kind.\nIt seems to be less central than the Greek philosophy, because\nChristian doctrine is expounded in terms of Neoplatonism, and not\nvice versa. On pages 140 and 141 the Words on the Cross \" Why\nhast Thou forsaken me ?\n\" are explained by reference to a theory of a\ncomposite soul, and there is no allusion to the fact, which would\nprobably have struck a Jewish mind, that the Words are a quotation\nfrom the first verse of Psalm 22. This is not the occasion for a further\nanalysis of the theology of the \" messages \", but they do suggest to\nme a \" backgroimd of thought \" that might have originally been\ncharacteristic of a Greek who had been converted from Neoplatonism\nto Christianity, but had by no means abandoned his old philosophy.\nThere is a possible reflection of Hebrew rather than Greek thought in\nthe teaching that \" we must not gaze into God's hght \"\n(p. 228), that\na great spirit was blinded by doing so, and that by that error evil\nwas born (pp. 223 and 226). This is more in the tradition of Philo\nthan Plotinus.\nTo sum up, the indications afforded by the \" messages \" themselves\npoint to a mode of thought that might have developed by the second\nor third century a.d. Why such a mode of thought should be re-\nflected in \" communications \" received today, and through what\nintervening stages they have been mediated I do not pretend to ex-\nplain. It is interesting to note that the pubhcation of further\n\" messages \" is promised, which may throw some additional light on\nthe mentahty of the source from which they come.\nYours faithfully,\nG. W. Lambebt.\n18 December 1937.\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014May I venture on a few comments on Dr Dingwall's very\nvaluable letter in the December Journall I call the letter \" very\n\f154 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1938\nvaluable \" because it is such a splendid example of a type of\ncriticism which is, in my opinion, far too common in psychical\nresearch, and it thus affords me an opportunity of ventilating the\nmatter.\nThis method of criticism may, I suggest, be called criticism by\ninnuendo. The modus operandi is really very simple. You discover\na suspicious looking circumstance, and then, without attempting to\nshow how this could have enabled the alleged phenomena to be\nproduced were the suspicions justified, far less how it did in fact\nenable them to be produced, you claim to have discredited the whole\naffair. Take this particular case. Dr Dingwall finds a Zener card\nfrom the back of which he is able to detect the marking on the front.\nHe does not tell us what were the circumstances in which he was\nable to detect this, whether, for example, close scrutiny in strong\nlight was necessary, nor whether these circumstances prevailed when\nthe experiments were being carried out.\nAs he quite correctly says, this card might have been the only\nfaulty one in the whole of the U.S.A., but I think that we may agree\nwith his unexpressed conviction that it was not. That, however,\ndoes not materially affect the issue. The point is that, even if all the\ncards were faulty, in this respect, would it have enabled the alleged\nresults to have been obtained by normal means ? How, for example,\ncould indications on the back of the cards enable the percipient to\nobtain knowledge of the markings on the front by normal means\nin the \" down-through \" experiments? In these experiments the\ncards remain in the pack until all have been called, so that normal\naccess to the backs of all but the top card is impossible before the\ncheck is made.\nAgain, where the cards are screened in opaque envelopes or the\npercipient is in another room, indications on the back would not\nseem to help. Dr Dingwall skates hghtly over this very thin ice\nand, with airy nonchalance, shifts the burden on to other shoulders.\nBut if he is so \" old an hand \" that he finds all these things ring\nfamiharly to him, surely he can enhghten the ignorance of us new\nhands and tell us exactly how the trick is done.\nI would suggest that it be laid down as a canon of criticism that\nprecise details must be given showing exactly how the results have,\nin fact, been obtained in the cu?cumstances actually existent. The\nmere suggestion of suspicious circumstances is not enough, though,\nof course, such suspicions should be investigated.\nYours truly, H. F. Saltmarsh.\n\fJantjaey 1938 Review 155\n19 December 1937.\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal.\nDear Madam,\u2014I have read Dr Dingwall's letter on his experience\nin America with much surprise. The blunder he describes is one so\ngross as to be well-nigh incredible, especially in view of Dr Rhine's\nelaborate precautions in this respect as in others. It is all the more\nsurprising, therefore, that Dr Dingwall should make such a charge\nagainst an unnamed individual or organization. I cannot reconcile\nhis action with the usual practice iu such matters in learned and\nscientific circles. I respectfully suggest to Dr Dingwall that he\nshould give details of time and place or be content to have his letter\nignored.\nYours, etc., Theodore Besterman.\nREVIEW\nTelepathie und Hellsehen. By Dr Alfred Frh. v. Winterstein,\n{Biicher der Seelenforschung, Vol. II.) Pp. viii + 244. (Franz\nLeo & Comp. : Amsterdam\u2014Leipzig\u2014Wien.)\nDr V. Winterstein's book contains, in an enlarged form, a course\nof lectures which he delivered at Viemia before the \" Urania \", a\nsort of popular university. It deals with the mental side of para-\npsychology exclusively.\nThe first four chapters are devoted to the description and analysis\nof the various forms of psychical phenomena : telepathy, spon-\ntaneous and experimental, mind-reading, psychometry, clairvoyance,\npremonition. The author always begins with definitions and the\ndiscussion of concrete cases, well selected as a rule ; the end of each\nchapter being devoted to a short theoretical discussion. The various\nsources of error are very clearly worked out : in particular with\nregard to clairvoyance and premonition. A special discussion is\ndevoted to book-tests and cross-correspondences.\nWith Chapter V the purely theoretical part of the book begins :\nthe unconscious in general and automatism are brought upon the\nscene. A particular chapter is devoted to the psychology of the\n\" medium \". Then follows an explanation of what may be called\nthe great psychical theories : animism, spirituahsm and the hypo-\nthesis of Osty's \" plan transcendental \". The author always remains\ncritical, objective and unbiassed. The last decision is left to the\nreader, with the single exception that all \" physical explanations\n\f156 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1938\n(radiation, \" psychical energy \") are radically rejected. A short\nexplanation of the strange attitude of \" official science \" towards\nparapsychology and a discussion of the relations between para-\npsychology and psychoanalysis form the end of the book.\nDr V. Winterstein's book may serve as an excellent introduction\ninto the subject, but it also is interesting and suggestive for those\nwho already possess an intimate knowledge of psychical facts and\ntheories.\nThe book is written in a very good and readable style. All con-\ncepts are clearly established. In the theoretical discussions no possi-\nbility seems to be overlooked. And it is a particular advantage of\nthe book that the facts, the \" cases \" always occupy the first place.\nHans Driesch (Leipzig).\nNOTICE\nThe attention of our Members is called to Bulletin III of the\nUniversity of London Council for Psychical Investigation :\n\" Pre-\nliminary Studies of a Vaudeville Telepathist,\" by S.

A resume of the paper will be pubhshed, it is hoped,\nin the Journal.\n\fFebruary 1938 Annual Report of the Council for 1937 159\nANNUAL EEPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOE 1937\n(1) Research Department. Under the direction of the Research\nCommittee, a full programme of investigation was carried out during\nthe year. The elaborate experiment with Mrs Garrett, began during\n1936, was completed, and a short report issued in the Journal. A\nquantitative experiment of a simpler type was performed with\nanother subject, who claimed to be able to acquire supernormal\nknowledge by examination of handwriting. The claim was not\nsubstantiated. Quantitative methods were also used in the study\nof a long series of predictions in connection with horse racing. This\ninvestigation is not yet completed.\nA large number of \" spontaneous \" cases have been investigated,\nfull notes of which may be seen by Members and Associates at the\nSociety's Rooms. Some of the cases have been of sufficient im-\nportance for printing in the Journal. Several alleged haunts have\nbeen examined, but none has been of sufficient evidential value for\nprinting.\nSittings have been held with mental \" mediums \", some of which,\nit is hoped, will later be reported. An investigation of a remarkable\ncase of apparently supernormal powers of healing is being carried\nout, but much remains to be done before an account can be\nissued.\nThe thanks of the Council are due to the University of London\nCouncil for Psychical Investigation for kindly inviting the Research\nOfficer to witness an experiment in \" Fire-waUdng \" by Ahmed\nHussain, and to the International Institute for Psychical Research\nfor a similar invitation to attend sittings with Fru Lara Agustsdottir,\nthe Icelandic \" medium \".\nMr Richmond's study of the Leonard records has been chiefly\ndevoted to the nature of material produced by a comparatively\nsmall number of individual communicators, taken over comparatively\nlong stretches of time. Further investigation wiU take in a larger\nnumber of communicators and the comparison of their methods and\ncharacteristics. A member of the Society has recently lent an im-\nportant body of carefully recorded private material in the interests\nof investigation.\n(2) Research Groups. In accordance with a resolution of the Coun-\ncil at a meeting held on October 29, 1936, a series of Study Groups\nwas formed for the purpose of examining material dealing with\nvarious branches of research. During the year, a number of Groups\nhave been constituted to study such subjects as Cross-correspond-\nences, Evidence of Purpose in alleged Communications, Witchcraft,\n\f160 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Febkuaky 1938\nHaunts and Apparitions, Proxy Cases, Evidence of Identity,\nLuminous Phenomena, and others. The Witchcraft Group arose as\na result of a memorandum by Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo in\nwhich he drew the attention of the Council to the Missiological Con-\nference held at Louvain in August 1936, at which reports were read\nof witchcraft practices amongst African natives. The Group pre-\npared a printed circular, written in French and Flemish, which was\nsent to a number of Belgian missionaries in the Congo, asking for\ninformation about any witchcraft phenomena which may have come\nTinder their notice. So far, only two repUes have been received, but\nit is hoped that more will arrive in time.\nIn connection with the Group Scheme, the thanks of the Council\nare due to all Members and Associates who have helped to further\nthe work, and especially to the Hon. Mrs Alfred Lyttelton, who has\nbeen throughout the driving spirit of the scheme.\nAs the result largely of the work of these Groups various members\nhave made arrangements with a publisher for the publication of a\nseries of books deahng with different aspects of the Society's work,\nand based mainly on material printed in our Proceedings and Journal.\nThe Council have gladly given permission to the authors to quote\nfrom the Proceedings and Journal, as these contain many cases of\ngreat importance for the study of Psychical Kesearch, httle known\nto the general pubUc, and not as well known as they might be to all\nour members. The first two books of the series are to be pubUshed\nin the Spring of 1938.\n(3) Several members of the Society, who have been conducting\ninvestigations independently of the Research Department, have\nbeen so good as to give the Society the benefit of the results of their\nresearches. Among these we may mention Mr S. G. Soal and Mrs\nK. M. Goldney.\nMr S. G. Soal has, during the past year, continued his repetition\nat University College of Dr J. B. Rhine's work in extra-sensory\nperception. Up to the present 120 persons have been tested and\nabout 100,000 guesses recorded. The general trend of the investiga-\ntion appears to be definitely negative.\nIn particular over 12,000 tests with Zener cards were carried out\nduring the summer with the medium Mrs Eileen Garrett.\nUnder the direction of Mrs Goldney blood-count experiments were\ncarried out by Dr Cuthbert Dukes with the same medium in the\ntrance state and also electrocardiograph experiments by Dr Geoffrey\nBoumey.\nMrs Goldney has also carried out a short series of eight proxy\nsittings with Mrs Garrett.\n\fPebrtjaey 1938 Annual Report of the Council for 1937 161\nThe results of these experiments by Mrs Goldney and Mr Soal will\nshortly be reported to the Society.\n(4) It is a feature common to most hnes of enquiry that as in-\nvestigations progress, they become increasingly technical and often\ndemand the apphcation of statistical methods. A few years ago\nseveral of our most active workers became convinced that their\nenquiries had reached the statistical stage. The Council, satisfied of\nthe importance of these enquiries, encouraged their pursuit and the\npublication of the results, although fully realising that they would\nprovide difficult reading. If some members have found recent parts\nof Proceedings too technical and dry, the Council ask them to exercise\npatience in view of the fact that the use of the quantitative method\nindicates that a definite stage of progress has been reached, and that\nother lines of enquiry are being pursued, the results of wliich when\npubUshed will be easier to follow.\n(5) Presidency. In February the Council welcomed to the Presi-\ndency Lord Kayleigh, whose father was President of the Society in\n1919 ; he delivered his Presidential Address in November.\n(6) Resignation of the Secretary. In November the Council received\nwith the very greatest regret an intimation from Miss Newton that,\nbeing well past the ordinary age for retirement, and finding the\nSociety's work somewhat of a strain, she desired to resign the post\nof Secretary, but was wilHng that her resignation should take effect\nat such a time as should be least inconvenient to the Council. The\nCouncil, on learning this, immediately passed the following unani-\nmous resolution :\n\" The Council desire to place on record their sense of the great\ndebt which the Society owes to Miss Newton for her services, first as\nAssistant Secretary, and afterwards as Secretary during thirty-four\nyears.\n\" They feel that it is hardly possible to over-estimate the benefit\nthe Society has derived from Miss Newton's wide knowledge of all\nmatters pertaining to its work, her zeal in furthering its interests, her\ntact and courtesy towards all.\"\nMiss Newton entered the Society's service in 1903 and in 1909\nbecame Secretary. The Council feel sure that they are expressing\nthe feehngs of the whole membership of the Society in wishing her\nall happiness in her retirement after so long and so devoted a period\nof service. It has been agreed that her resignation shall take effect\nas from Ladyday 1938.\n(7) The Editorship of the Journal. The Council also regret to\nrecord the resignation by Miss Nea Walker of the post of Hon.\n\fM \u00ab O\nS ^^ P-i\nO O 00\nC5 O l-H\n00 iH\nCO i-l\n\u00abOXOOXOOO(MX\no o\no o\no o\nO 00\nm\nS .2\nCD \u2122\nO 01 00 Ci OO 00\nO CO in CO -Tti\nO TiH O O O\n^ iH (M Tl<\n1-1\ny s s\ns\nS\n1\n1\n^3 S\no\ns\na\na.\nS o\n^1\no o o\nU5 o o\niH O rH\niH\nO CO\niH\nOS\n'oi\n(M\nCM\nS\nS S\n<^ -S\nI i\n>\no\no\nQJ\nf-i\n'\nO\n+^\nt>\nr CO\nCO\nCO CO 5J\nOi tH 00\n^15\n^ 3 g o\nO \" ^\nCD ^ g \u2022\u00ab\nsi \u00a7\n^ .2 &i\ns ^ g s\nft, A, -5\n5 a ,C\n^ o ^ ^\nCJ ^ * CO\n2 s -s a\nts O I\u20141 R\nCO O O uO\nO uO O \u00bb0\nO i-H ITS\nT-l\nO VO Tj<\nrH in\ni-H O CO\nerf 00\nO (M O\nO CO (M\n^ ^ ^ CD t> 00\nCO I> 00 CO CO CO\no\nrH\no\nCO\nGO (M\nrH\n\u00a7 1^\n^ in oi\nX o\ns\n22 '^s\na, !\no\nc\no\n\u2022S I, 2\nfi^\n-^1 CO\nto\nCO\nId\na\n. 3\n\"I\n^ m P^\nO OS\nft S ^ 03\n'Si y\n^ <; (i>\ns S ^ a\n^ i: a o\nI O 5 fi\nca pi\n^ a\nOS\n\u00a7\u00a73\nPi\nCP c o\noo\nCO Uj OJ\na fl\n\u2022\ngoo;\nijj\n1.\n\u2022rJ 1j \"1-1\n:\n\u00ab\u00ab ^ O o'^^'M\nCm rH rH rH\na>^c+i':rfc+l\npi\nCD\no\nQ JJ P, I\na p\ncq\n<4<\n\fo o O) Oi\n1-1 o o a rH\nla o o t>- 00\nCO ITS\nS5 e\n.s\nas\n65 -S S\nK| -\nSi \u00ab\ns .g ,\nS ^\n1.0 3\nS s S\n\u00bb e\n6s\nS H\nCO a\nrH\n<D CO\nO (M\nO 00\no CO\nrH\nI>\nrH\n\u00a3284\nin o\n00\no o\na\n3\nP\na. s,^\nO 1\u20141\nT-H l-H O\no o 1\u2014i rH CO\no Ci iH\n\\a I\u2014\nI\nCI\ntH I>\nCO CO\nrH ^ -fcS to\nJ3 ^ o)\nrH P,\nCO GJ 3 O\n^ \" ^ rn\n2 s\no\no\nO\nO O \u00a3 go*\nOS\n0^\n\u00a7\nCl\no\nft?\nO\nCD\no\no\no\no CI a\nrH\n00 CO\nc+1\nS o\nc- (H 03\nt P ^\nCO\nCD\n3\nO\nI\u2014\nI\nW\nOi o\nCi CO\nrH\n00 t-H\nCO CO\nrH\no\ntH CO\nrH a:\nSi\nis\n2 =\nCO ^\n|o\n\"a\n5 01\n^ O CO\n^-grH\n^ P, 4>\n|.S8\ni 'o i s^s\nS- -tJ O 4) r-f\n3 O >CO\na o\n-\n\fo CO Oi\nCD o\nCO o lO\no o CO\nrH\n1\nfl, a,\n1> CO M d\ni-l\nrH CO I> o\nrH\n) i-t (M CO\n00 ur5\n1\nTti CD CO\n(N\ns.\nc+t\n?1 '\nO\n8 <! <!\n1=^\n-S\nO O\nto\nt3\n3\na\n3\nO\na\no\nd\nin\nSo\nglQO\no o\no\nft\nt=\nia\nS\no\nft\na\nt3\np.\nB\no\nO\n>.\ni\nc3 CP\ng 7; ^ ^\no3\no: I-l -5\nin P\no S\n\u00ab \u00a7\n& t3\nS g\nCO\n\u00ab a\n.a \u00bb g\n\u00a7 fl ^\np\nn a\no o o Izj\nb\u00a3i ne !\u00bb CO\no3 eS\nCO M h-\nO O O tH o o\no o o o o o\nO O O 00 O I>\nCO i-H 00 O to OS\nO O IC\nr-r =*i \u00ab \u00ab^\nt3\nd\n_ ^\nd S >.\n^ CO p-\n'3\n:\nCO ^ ^\ni\n^ ^\n'\nce o3 [H\n:\n^ .5 I\n9 9\nt3 '3\nPI M\nHH hH\nCO yi [V)\nO O Hi i-q p\u00a3i\nO 00 (>J\no o o o\no o o o\no o o\nrH CO CO O\nin cq <M i>\nc+1 crt r crt\n(M CO\nwiOt^rHaioooo\nrH-^OOrHdOOOO\nOOClOJCDOlOOOrH\nlOCOrHOOOOiOOCD\nC+lrHo4crtCOO0(M OJrH\nrH C+1 C+i ^-\n^ C*J\no o\nt+t\n\fFebruary 1938 Annual Report of the Council for 1937 165\nEditor of the Journal, on account of her removal to a greater distance\nfrom London and her desire to have more time to devote to other\nwork. Miss Walker kindly agreed to become Hon. Editor in 1934,\nat a time of great difficulty, and the Council wish to place on record\ntheir warmest thanks for the valuable work she has done.\n(8) Exemption from Income Tax. As indicated at the last Annual\nGeneral Meeting the Society were then pressing a claim for exemp-\ntion from Income Tax, and the Council are glad to state that at the\nhearing before the Special Commissioners in July last the Society\nwere completely successful and obtained not only future exemption\nbut a refimd of tax paid during the last six years, on its own invest-\nments and also on the investments comprised in the Eesearch\nEndowment Fund and the Myers Memorial Fund. This success is\ngratifying, both as affording a much needed rehef to the Society's\nfinancial position and also because in order to obtain this exemption\nit was necessary to estabhsh the fact that the Society's work was not\nmerely of interest to its members, but of pubhc utiUty. At the hearing\nbefore the Special Commissioners Lord Rayleigh quoted with great\neffect some passages from his father's Presidential Address to the\nSociety, and Dr T. W. Mitchell gave an impressive account of the\ncontributions made by leading members of the Society to the develop-\nment of psycho-therapy. A large share, however, of the credit for\nthe happy result belongs to Miss Newton, without whose initiative\nand careful preparation of the Society's case no such success would\nhave been achieved.\n(9) The Finances of the Society. Notwithstanding the exemption\nfrom Income Tax, the Society's financial position is such that every\neconomy must be effected if the Society is to continue its work with\nefficiency, and without making substantial drafts on its capital\nresources. The House and Finance Committee, of which Mr H. F.\nSaltmarsh was appointed an additional member, went into the\nsituation very thoroughly and presented to the Coimcil a report, the\nrecommendations of which were unanimously accepted by the\nCouncU, and will, it is hoped, materially improve the position.\nAs mentioned in the Last Annual Report, the Council thought\nthe time was ripe for making an Appeal to persons outside the\nSociety's membership. This Appeal was at first sent only to a\nsmall number of persons with disappointing results. Now that\nexemption from Income Tax has been granted, it will be possible to\nuse the scheme employed by many Societies whereby donations, to\nbe received free of tax, are spread over a number of years. With\nthe help of this scheme it may be possible to interest donors whom\nthe previous Appeal failed to reach.\n\f166 Journal of Society for Psychical Research February 1938\n(10) Myers Memorial Lecture. The Council appointed Mr C. A.\nMace of Bedford College to deliver the 5th Lecture under this\nfoundation. The Lecture was deUvered on the 27 October 1937 and\nhas been pubUshed in Proceedings, and as a separate pamphlet,\nserial with the preceding Myers Memorial Lectures.\n(11) Library. Owing to the pressure of her professional duties,\nMiss Kathleen Watkins resigned early in the year her appointment\nas Hon. Librarian, and Mr G. H. Spinney, Assistant Cataloguer in\nthe Department of Printed Books, British Museum, kindly consented\nto take her place. The Council are deeply indebted to Mr Spinney,\nwho since his appointment in April has devoted much time to work\nin the Library.\nIn addition to Members and Associates who consulted books in\nthe Library, 65 Members borrowed books, the total number of\nbooks lent to Members being 474. Seventy-four books were bor-\nrowed by members of the public through the National Central\nLibrary for Students.\nWe are glad to note a substantial increase in the number of\nMembers who have availed themselves of the privilege of borrowing\nbooks from other Libraries through the National Central Library\nfor Students.\n(12) Obituary. During the past year the Society lost in Professor\nF. C. S. Schiller a Vice-president and former President and Member\nof Council. A memorial notice will be published in the Proceedings.\nAmong other losses we may mention the Rev. A. T. Fryer and\nProfessor Fraser-Harris ; also Mrs F. W. H. Myers, who had been\na Member of the Society from its earUest days and took a prominent\npart in the foundation of the Myers Memorial Lectureship.\n(13) Membership of the Society. During the year 33 new Members\nand 2 Student Associates were elected. The total loss in Members\nfrom deaths, resignations and other causes was 44 Members and\n15 Associates, leaving a net decrease of 11 Members and 13 Associates.\nThe total membership of the Society now stands at 699.\n(14) Publications. Two Parts of the Proceedings were published\nduring the year ; Part 150 in October and Part 151 in November.\nThe Secretary's sales to the general pubhc amounted to \u00a325 7s. 5d.,\nand to members of the Society, \u00a38 2s. lOd., and through the Society's\nagent in the United States, \u00a312 6s.

Presidential Address by Lord Rayleigh, F.R.S.\n* General Meetings.\nCORRESPONDENCE\nThe Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal\nSir,\u2014The force of Mr Saltmarsh's arithmetical criticism of\nmy poultry-yard example depends on a fallacious view of the nature\nof statistical significance from which I presiimed that my hypotheti-\ncal referee was free. This is the view that when the level of statistical\nsignificance is reached, a hypothesis that was previously uncertain\nbecomes certain. There is really no discontinuity in the amount of\njustified conviction with which a hypothesis can be accepted when\nP changes from a value just below -05 to one just above. In my\nexample, P was below -05 but only shghtly below, so the referee\nwould have felt a strong (and justified) conviction that there was a\nreal difference between poultry yards. Mr Saltmarsh shows that\nshghtly different figures for one of the poultry owners would have\nbrought the value of P practically up to -05. So it would, and, if\nthese had been the figures, the referee would have felt slightly (but\nno more than shghtly) stronger conviction of the reahty of the\ndifference. It is true that he might have given the verdict to the\npoultry-owners now although he withheld it before, but with very\nhttle more conviction of the reahty of the difference. It is necessary\nto draw the line somewhere. An examiner may pass a student with\n41 marks while he fails one with 39, but he does not make the mistake\nof supposing that one is much better than the other.\n\f168 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Februaky 1938\nIf Mr Whately Carington's results lay as near the level for signifi-\ncance as this, we should certainly conclude that they provided strong\nevidence for the hypothesis tested. They are, in fact, very far from\nthat level and no small alteration of the figures could bring them\nthere. The effect of Mr Saltmarsh's changes in my poultry-yard\nexample is not, therefore, parallel to anything that could happen to\nW. W. C.'s results.\nThere is no assumption in W. W. C.'s argument that all words in\nthe lists are of equal value or that reaction times of normal length\nare reliable. His reason for scahng down abnormally long reaction\ntimes was not that these were subject to an error from which the\nothers were free, but that any error in these would, if they were not\nscaled down, have an undue influence on any quantities calculated\nfrom them. The free-association test (like all psychological tests)\ngives results that are more or less unreliable as a result of random\nvariabihty of the results ; a subject who gives a 2\" response for\n\" window \" might have given, let us say, 1-6\" or 2-4\" and perhaps\ndoes at other times of testing. This is less serious than might appear,\nbecause the effect of random variation in the quantities measured is\nalways to reduce any measure we make of the relationships between\ndifferent test results. They cannot produce significant inter-\ncorrelations between test results although they may obscure correla-\ntions that would otherwise be found. It sometimes happens that a\ntest is useless as a measuring instrument because the amount of\nrandom variation is so great that no rehable measurement of different\nindividuals can be obtained from it. That is clearly not always the\ncase with W. W. C.'s use of the word-association test, since his tables\nshow many significant relations. On the other hand, it is sometimes\nthe case, since sometimes subjects do not even show significant\nsimilarity to themselves {i.e. W. W. C.'s \" Individuality \"). This is\nwhat is discussed in my Section VII. The main point is that the\nlow reliabihty of tests of some subjects gives no reason for doubting\nsignificant measures of relation when we get them ; it means only\nthat we are less likely to get them.\nWhen, however, the test results are known to suffer from large\nrandom error, this fact does decrease the force of negative evidence.\nThis, I think, is Mr Saltmarsh's main point. He says that my nega-\ntive conclusions are rendered invahd as well as W. W. C.'s positive\nones. But what negative conclusions have I drawn? Only that\nW. W. C.'s investigation does not provide evidence for the autonomy\nof communicators. That, surely, is incontestable. If Mr Saltmarsh\nrefers to my page 273, he will see that I do not draw the conclusion\nthat it provides evidence against the autonomy of communicators.\n\fFebeuaey 1938 Correspondence 169\nFor that purpose, it would be necessary to show that if there were\nautonomous communicators, the method woiild have been suffi-\nciently sensitive to reveal them. That seems to me not to have been\nshown.\nThe situation that the investigation gives us no evidence either for\nor against the hypothesis is an unsatisfactory one, but this unfortunate\nconclusion does not detract for the merit of W. W. C.'s achievement\nof devising the general lines of a method which might be used with\nother tests than the word-association test. If anyone wishes to carry\nout a similar investigation with some other kind of psychological\ntest, I should suggest that the first necessity is careful experimenta-\ntion with different kinds of test in order to discover one that com-\nbines with the other requirements for this sort of investigation, the\nmerit of high self-consistency as shown by high correlation between\ndifferent apphcations of the test to the same person at different\ntimes.\nYours faithfully, Robert H. Thoxjless.\n(Professor Thouless does, however, appear to suggest\u2014on p. 275\nof his paper\u2014that further tests by Mr Carington's method could\nprovide evidence against the autonomy of communicators : \"If\nthese tests too give negative results, the conclusion that there are no\nautonomous communicators in seances will become a very probable\none.\" Ed.)\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS\nThe Journal of Parapsychology, Vol. I. No. 2, June 1937. Duke\nUniversity Press, Durham, N.C. Editors: William McDougall\nand William Banks Rhine.\nThis number begins with a paper by Dr Warner on the question of\nhow far the apparently supernormal results in E.S.P. experiments\ncan be explained by the failure of the statistical methods in the face\nof what he calls \" runs of luck \". He describes experiments in\nwhich he attempted to isolate \" runs of luck \" in results obtained by\npure chance. He was unable to obtain significant figures. He con-\ncludes that he can find no evidence for the \" run of luck \" hypothesis.\nIn a final note, he stresses the obvious danger of testing a number of\npeople selected at random, choosing the few who score high for fur-\nther tests, and then combining with the material obtained in the\nfurther tests the high scores from the prehminary tests. This is, as\nhe points out, selecting data after the data have been obtained. Mr\nMacfarland and Dr R. W. George contribute an interesting paper on\n\f170 Journal of Society for Psychical Research February 1938\ntests carried out with E.S.P. cards, some of which bore the usual\nsymbols, and others the symbols in a greatly distorted form. Out\nof thhteen subjects, only one was found to give a significantly\nhigher score with the normal cards. The average score was no less\nthan 7-1 liits per 25 cards.\nAn experiment of the effect on E.S.P. of varying the size and num-\nber of the symbols is described in a paper by Dr Louisa Ehine. She\nmade over fourteen thousand trials with child subjects, using cards\nwith normal symbols mixed with cards bearing unusually large sym-\nbols and others with five symbols instead of one on each card. No\nsignificant discrimination was found, although the total results were\nsignificant of E.S.P.\nMiss Bond contributes an interesting paper describing number\nguessing experiments carried out with backward children. The\nresults appear to be significant, though the conditions were not all\nthat could be desired.\nMr Vernon Sharp and Professor C. C. Clark describe E.S.P.\nexperiments carried out by them in the Science Department of the\nSchool of Commerce, Accounts, and Finance of New York University.\nThey made 126,075 trials, and conclude that E.S.P. is a real faculty.\nThe existence of a faculty for E.S.P. amongst blind and partially\nblind subjects is discussed in a paper by IVIiss M. M. Price and Miss\nM. H. Pegram. They carried out a series of tests in the Parapsycho-\nlogical Laboratory of Duke University using 66 subjects whose sight\nwas affected, ranging in age from 8 to 35 years. Ordinary E.S.P.\ncards were used in some tests, and in others similar cards which had a\nblank card glued to their faces, and were also enclosed in an opaque\nenvelope. Forty-five per cent, of the subjects gave significant scores.\nThe scores with the sealed cards were found to be higher than those\nwith the ordinary cards. The experimenters were not able to corre-\nlate ability to score with age or extent of blindness.\nThe number also contains a glossary of the words used in the\ndescriptions of E.S.P. experiments.\nThe Journal of Parapsychology, Vol. I. No. 3, September 1937.\n''^\nIn an Editorial Comment mention is made of various E.S.P. ex-\nperiments which have failed to yield significant results, including\nthose of Mr S. G. Soal.^ The Editors stress the importance of such\nresults being pubhshed, and add that the pages of their Journal are\nas fully open to records of negative as of positive results. It is\npointed out that E.S.P. cards are now on sale at book and novelty\n1 Journal, S.P.R., 1937, Vol. XXX, p. 55.\n\fFebeuaey 1938 Notes on Periodicals 171\nstores in America at very reasonable prices. These cards are of two\ntypes, Pack No. 1 having plain symbols, and Pack No. 2 having\nsymbols in five different colours. A plate is given showing the\nappearance of the faces and back of the cards of No. 1 pack.^\nIn an important paper, Dr J. F. Kubis and Mi- F. L. Rouke de-\nscribe an experiment in spontaneous telepathy between similar and\ndissimilar twins. They obtained six sets of twins, one set similar,\nand the rest dissimilar. The procedure was as follows : each twin\nsat in a separate room, and the experimenter sat in a third room.\nThe experimenter concentrated his mind on a series of E.S.P. cards,\nand each twin was asked to guess the cards. A system of light\nsignals indicated to each twin when the experimenter passed from\none card to the next. The object of the experunent was to see if the\ntwo sets of guesses would correspond owing to telepathic interaction\nbetween the twins, but this was not explained to the subjects, who\nassumed that the sole object was to guess the experimenter's card.\nNo significant correspondence between the guesses was observed,\nalthough two of the subjects scored significantly high.\nProfessor J. B. Rhine reviews the effect of distance in experiments\nin E.S.P. He refers to experiments carried out at Tarkio College\nwrhere subject and experimenter were separated by distances varying\nfrom 0 to 1,400 ixdles. The method used was for the subject to call\nthrough a pack of 25 cards which was not disturbed until after the\ntest was over. The average loits per 25 for the whole series of 26,125\ntrials was 5-52. Distance seemed to make no significant difference.\nIn another series of experiments carried out at Duke University,\ndistances up to 3,000 miles were used, giving an average of 5-15 hits\nper 25 over 23,925 trials. Again, distance was not found to be\nsignificant.\nMiss D. R. Martin describes experiments with E.S.P. cards in\nwhich scores which were above apparent chance were obtained. She\nconcludes that one of three hypotheses is true : (1) That there is an\nunknown error of procedure. (2) That the mathematical analysis is\nat fault. (3) That a faculty of E.S.P. really exists.\nMiss M. H. Pegram describes a liighly interesting experiment in\nwhich two series of tests were made, one with a view to obtaining\n^ Two specimen packs of Pack No. 1 have been received by the Society, but\nunfortunately it has been foimd that they are totally unsuitable for serious\nexperimental work. The pattern on the backs extends up to the edges of the\ncard, and, owing to irregularities in cutting, the pattern varies in different\nspecimens so that cards can be identified by looking at the back. It would be\nhighly undesirable to use such cards in any tests where it was required to rule\nout telepathy, or where there was the slightest possibility of the subject seeing\nthe backs of the cards. Research Officer, S.P.R.\n\f172 Journal of Society for Psychical Research February 1938\nhigh scores, and the other with a view to obtaining low scores. Miss\nPegram herself acted as subject throughout, and made a total of\n184,970 calls. The method was for her to call through a shuffled\npack of 25 cards, and then to check the results. It was found that\nthe average score for series in which a high score had Ijeen desired\nwas significantly high and that the other was significantly low. It\nis interesting to notice that in the attempts at high scoring there were\nmore correct hits towards the beginning and end of the pack than\nin the middle, and that the reverse was true of the attempts at low\nscoring.\nThe mathematics of the E.S.P. technique is reviewed by Dr J. A.\nGreenwood and Mr C. E. Stuart in an interesting paper. They con-\ntrast the critical ratio and methods, and show that each is capable\nof rehable application in E.S.P. tests.\nMr G. N. M.

The first series was described by me in the Journal for\n1901 and to this account of mine I beg to refer my readers. My\nfriend, the late Serge Kaznakoff (called \" C \" in the Journal) and I,\nwrote using a saucer with an ink mark, which saucer moved over a\nsheet of paper with the letters of the alphabet. We got a series of\nmessages from a certain Mainoff, a Russian anthropologist and\nethnographer who had died a few years before. I still think they\ngave us good evidence of cryptomnesia or latent memory\u2014but\nnothing more. From this standpoint they were undoubtedly\ninteresting. Kaznakoff's bona fides I had no reason whatever to\nimpugn, but it goes, in my opinion, without saying that if undoubted\ninstances of knowledge apparently acquired supernormally had then\nbeen obtained by us, this lack of disbelief on my part in his good\nfaith would not have been enough. This raises an important ques-\ntion, how far are we scientifically entitled to take an automatist's\ngood faith for granted ? Personally I would draw the line somewhere\nbetween cryptonxnesia (which Science can be said to accept) and\nclairvoyance, or cryptomnesia and thought transference. To postu-\nlate bo7ia fides without further guarantees when we are faced with\noccurrences, at least experimental occurrences, as yet unrecognised\nby science, seems to me unscientific and illogical. I admit however\nthat the distinction is not always easy to draw.\nThe second series of experiments took place when I was already\na political emigre, in Finland and in Germany. The supposed\nmedium was a Russian emigree girl whose pet-name was Tarda\n\u2014\nthough, as a matter of fact, she never laid claims, I believe, to any\n\" abnormal \" powers. Again we wrote, using a saucer and alphabet.\nThe very first experiment was a brilliant success, the \" spirits\n\"\ngiving us correctly the page number of a book of 450 pages, opened\nby me at random (unknown to anyone), under conditions which I\nstill think completely precluded the possibility of cheating. I\ntherefore determined to make a decisive effort to get proof positive\nof clairvoyance of this kind and held with Tania a series of some\nthirty seances. But, alas, we never got a second successful experi-\nment like the one at Wiborg ;\nsuspicious circumstances were noticed\n(though there was no downright exposure) and in the very, very few\n^ This is the summary of a paper read before the S.P.R. on 26th January.\n\f178 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Maech 1938\nsuccessful experiments which still deserve attention there was\nalways some flaw tending to invalidate them. Two such cases I\nbriefly described in the paper read before the Society. In the first\nthe contents of the page of a book were very correctly summarised\nby the saucer, under conditions which seemed to render normal sight\nimpossible, but it turned out that Tania had had the opportunity of\nseeing (and perusing) the book the day before. In the second case,\nwhere the contents of a page of a book were also reproduced very\nexactly, the possibihty of the medium having normally glanced at\nthe lines at the bottorn of the page was not excluded ; the information\ngiven in that \" message \" can therefore be explained in a normal\nway if we assume that the contents of the book (which belonged to\nTania) were so well known to her that she was able to summarise\nthose of a given page by merely seeing a couple of lines at the bottom.\nOn the whole, the thirty or so seances with Tania were a dis-\nappointment. It has often occurred to me that it almost looked as\nif \" someone \" had attempted to interest me intensely in the matter,\nin the beginning\u2014only to \" let me down \" afterwards\n!\nMy Tania experiments are described in detail in the defunct\nZeitsckrift fiir kritischen OJckultismus, I Band, II Heft (1926).\nFrom this series we are entitled to draw some instructive con-\nclusions :\n(1) In the course of more than thirty seances, I obtained only one\nresult which might be claimed as primafacie supernormal. It shows\nwhat an awful waste of time such experimenting is liable to be. It\nalso shows that private mediums and \" subjects \"\n\u2014even handsome\nand innocent-looking Russian emigree girls\u2014are no guarantee that\nthe supposed phenomena are authentic. It is true, I repeat, that\nthere was no drastic exposure, but there undoubtedly were sus-\npicious peculiarities and circumstances.\n(2) An attempt made by Mme Z., a lady-friend of mine, and my-\nself to entrap Tania and to convict her of preparing beforehand\npassages from books and then palming them off on us through the sau-\ncer, as if obtained \" clairvoyantly \", was a failure. And yet (it was,\nhowever, years later), the same Mme Z. maintained in my presence\nthat on this occasion we did expose Tania, and persisted in main-\ntaining this in spite of my statements to the contrary. Now, on this\npoint, there can be no doubt whatsoever (see Z.fur krit. Okk., ibidem,\np. 90). This shows what tricks our memory will play on us at times ;\nit also shows\u2014an interesting point\u2014that the so-called mythopoeic\ntendency is apt to work both ways!\n(3) Though Tania's subsequent .behaviour repeatedly gave rise to\nwell-founded suspicions, the first Wiborg experiment remains\n\fMaech ]938 Series of Experiments in Automatic Writing 179\nentirely unaffected by what occurred later. Whatever be its ex-\nplanation (I am reluctantly ready to postulate chance-coincidence),\nit cannot be explained away by cheating on Tania's part. From\nwhich I will conclude that in psychical research, each case must be,\nbroadly speaking, judged on its own merits. And, as a rule at least,\nwe must not ponder too much over a medium's general reputation\n\u2014\nunless, in the strict sense of the word, it has been compromised\nirremediably.\n(4) In the Tania experiments, I unwittingly spoilt them myself,\nby suggesting to the \" spirits \" in the very beginning (but after the\nfirst successful experiment) that the saucer should be allowed to\n\" look \" (under the sheet of paper) at the page number or at the\ntext printed. When making such a suggestion I was under the im-\npression of a successful seance I had attended many years before and\nof some statements made to me by M. Aksakoff, in whose experience\nthere had also been cases which seemed to imply physical limitations\nso far as clairvoyance of this kind was concerned.^ Of course my\nintention was to make the conditions gradually as stringent as\npossible should the results obtained permit it, but unfortunately\nsuch a moment did not present itself, and meanwhile the suggestion\nmade by me opened for the supposed medium probably undreamt of\nfacilities of fraud. On the whole, a striking instance, I should think,\nof the impression which preposterous and pseudo-scientific hypo-\ntheses are apt to make even on sober-minded and sceptical investiga-\ntors.\nI do not, however, regret too much the waste of time and the dis-\nillusions connected with my seances with Tania\u2014but only for the\nsake of the first Wiborg trial. No other incident in the whole course\nof my many investigations impressed me to such an extent, and I\nwill never forget the feeling of intense and unspeakable bewilder-\nment I experienced when faced with its strikingly successful result.^\nPerovsky-Peteovo-Solovovo\n^ I also recollected the cases of \" transposition of the senses \" repeatedly\nalleged to have been observed in bygone days by magnetisers and mesmerists.\n2 1 subsequently ascertained that the book in question had the tendency of\nopening at times on the same page (193). I emphatically maintain that I made\nthis discovery, but later ; but some people may think it possible that I sub-\nconsciously was already aware of this detail when using the saucer with Tania\nat this first seance, and therefore could have unwittingly influenced the result.\nI can only say that I reject such an \" explanation \" and prefer\u2014though without\nenthusiasm\u2014to postulate a fortuitous coincidence.\n\f180 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1938\nM. 110. CASE.\nThe following incident suggests normal perception of the un-\nexpected reappearance of a lost object (a ruby), but perception\nwhich failed to reach the level of conscious recognition. The point\nof interest is the directive energy set going by the subliminal aware-\nness of the stone's position, so that a motor automatism was ex-\nperienced, compelling the experient to turn and consciously recog-\nnise the object of perception. The directive purpose of the movement\nis indicated not only by the result, but by a preceding impression\nas though an independent fraction of the personahty were speaking\nabout the ruby.\nThe case illustrates the way in which an impression of direction\nby an exterior influence can arise, whether or not the experient\nthinks of it as exterior, and whether or not there is evidence of a\nparanormal element in the occurrence.\n4 January, 1938. To the Editor of The Journal\nSir,\u2014The enclosed account of finding a lost article, about a\nmonth ago, by my wife, may be of some interest as it relates not\nmerely the sequence of the events but stresses the affective impres-\nsions actually felt by her at the time.\nI can corroborate the account, as I was told about this ruby being\nlost and examined the ring on the same day the stone was missing.\nI suggested it might have dropped into the washing basin and gone\ndown the sink and thought no more about it.\nMy wife called me the next morning to look on the floor of the\nscullery to see the stone ghnting in the sunlight and told me the\ncurious feeling she had of being caught by the shoulder and made to\nlook round, saying there was no tactile sensation, but we agreed it\nwas analogous to the sensation of being held back on a pavement\nwhen about to cross a road in traff^ic, no doubt a common experience\nto some of your readers.\nI attribute this to the Doppelganger or that part of our person-\nality which would split off' and dramatize itself beyond this incipient\nstage in abnormal and hysterical subjects.\nYours faithfully, Max West.\nMrs West describes her experience as follows :\nI lost a ruby from a gold ring I was wearing last December, and\nhaving washed some articles in very soapy water thought that most\nUkely it had come out then and been washed down the drain so gave\n\fMaech 1938 Case 181\nit up as lost. The following morning I was in the same room, when\nI seemed to hear somebody say, \" What about that ruby? \" and\nwithout thinking that I was alone, audibly repHed, \" Oh that's gone\nfor good, it is of no use troubling about that.\" By that time I\nreahzed that I was replying to no visible person, but before I could\nthink further, I seemed to be grasped by the shoulders and twisted\nround, and the first thing my eyes rested upon was the ruby on the\nfloor shining in a shaft of sunhght made by the outside door being\nopen a crack. I do not wish it to be thought that I felt my shoulders\ngrasped, any more than I heard any particular person's voice, but\nthat I was aware of myself as a person inside my body, but the same\nshape, which heard and felt quite well without my body.\nE. E. West.\nThis account is of interest, not only as a record of the incident, but\nalso as an attempt to describe the contradictory impressions ex-\nperienced during a moment of dissociation.\nIn a further letter Mr West suggests a view of the incident which\nis worth discussion :\n\" You ask if Mrs West could have perceived subconsciously before\nbecoming conscious of the impulse to look. Yes, but not with the\nordinary senses . . . that surely is excluded in subconscious percep-\ntion\u2014unless you mean that the eye registered the object absent-\nmindedly (the attention being focussed elsewhere) and then the\nlatent image of the object set the motor reaction going when the\nprevious preoccupation had relaxed? I think not, in this and other\ncases, also in dreaming cases, though I grant you that in auditory\nperception a delayed focussing is more hkely, we often fail to hear at\nthe moment and recall later. But in this instance the surprise on\nfirst seeing would have brought the attention to focus at once had\nthere been any retinal reception. . . .\n\" My wife is quite positive she had no normal sense perception\nprevious to the urge to look and that she often experiences similar\noccurrences accompanied by some affective tonal quahty.\"\nMr West further suggests that \" there is now so much cumulative\nevidence of supernormal perception that we ought to consider the\nhypothesis of a subtle body interpenetrating the grosser ;\norganised\n(not dupUcate) to be able at times to stimulate the appropriate cor-\ntical centres.\"\nIt seems likely that perception by normal eyesight can fail to reach\nconscious recognition more commonly than Mr West here supposes,\n\f182 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1938\nthough undoubtedly the delay in recognising sounds is easier to\nobserve. None the less, we are familiar with the experience of\nfailing to \" see \" something that we are actually searching for, when\nit is straight in front of our eyes. \" Retinal reception \" is consistent\nwith anything from complete blindness (if the optic nerve does not\nfunction) to complete cognition of the image ; and there is much\nevidence of an intermediate stage of subliminal cognition. The\npositive conviction of an observer that he has not \" seen \" an object\nwhich has been in his field of vision can indicate no more than the\nabsence of a consciously recognised image ; and in the case of an\nobserver who has been moving about in a room where a ruby lies in\na shaft of light, the probability of its having been normally per-\nceived, at some level of cognition, appears to be large.\nThere is a risk of confusing the evidence for paranormal functions\nif we assume that the anomalies of normal sense-perception belong\nin the same class of phenomena.\nCASE : A DREAM SUGGESTING PLANNED\nEVIDENCE OF SURVIVAL\nThe experient in the following spontaneous case, Miss I. Sollas, is\nknown personally to Mrs Salter, to whom she wrote in the first\ninstance for an opinion upon the dream and its sequel. We quote\nthe description, given in this letter, of her experience ; the dream\noccurred and was noted in May, 1937, and facts relating to it were\ndiscovered during the following December.\nLetter dated January 14, 1938.\n\" In this dream my father came holding out to me a handful of\nfountain pens. I could not understand what he wanted me to do with\nthem. He went away to his room and came again bringing another\nhandful and anxiously asking me to '\nsend them to the same address '.\n\" I awoke puzzled, and began to remember that shortly before\nthe end^ he had given me a parcel of silver paper, saying it was the\ncollection of a lifetime, and would I take it for him to the hospital.\nDid I know the address? He said he would have taken it himself if\nhe had known what address to take it to ; was I sure I knew the\naddress? It seemed to me very odd at the time, because the Hos-\npital is a place everyone knows, including himself.\n\" Well, after some time, I was in his study and found a box with\na label, '\nold fountain pens ', containing a handful of them, and\nthought this looked like something interesting. Later, in another\n1 Miss Sollas's father died on Oct. 20, 1936.\n\fMaech 1938 Case 183\npart of the room, I found another box similarly labelled and also con-\ntaining a handful\u2014corresponding to the two handfuls of my dream.\nI asked a friend if she knew whether okl fountain pens were ever\ncollected for charities, and she said Yes, she had once seen an adver-\ntisement asking for them.\n\" My father was interested in the experiment made by\u2014was it\nMyers? \u2014someone who left a document locked up for survivors to\nsee if they could tell its contents after his death. ^ I remember my\nfather saying he should have thought some simpler device should\nhave been thought of, and this seemed to me like his simpler version\nof that experiment.\"\nIn replying to an inquiry on points of detail, Miss Sollas added the\nfollowing notes :\n'\n' To me the dream was convincing because of the combined vivid-\nness and fogginess of it. I mean a vivid impression of an effort to\nput an idea across.\n\" The scene of the dream was a study of many years ago, and he\nwent upstairs\u2014which meant, in that house, that he went to his bed-\nroom. This point is of importance : because one of the boxes I\nfound was on a bookshelf at one end of the room he used in this\nhouse as both study and bedroom. Tliis box I may, as you suggest,\nhave seen without noticing it (i.e. before the dream). The other box\nwas at the bedroom end of this large room, in the remotest corner of\na drawer of his chest of drawers. This box I should never have seen.\n\" I beheve he made the plan long ago in the former house, and kept\none box in his bedroom and one in his study. The labels look as\nthough made long ago.\"\nIt appears that the request to have silver paper delivered at the\nhospital, with the curious insistence on the address, was not made\nduring illness, when some degree of mental vagueness might have\nsupervened. Miss Sollas writes on this point\n:\n\" When my father gave me the silver paper he was in fair health.\nHe wasn't very well, but he was working. He had not then called\nin the doctors who told him to expect the end.\n\" He laid great stress on the difficulty about the address. I\nimagined at the time that he thought we had to find a collecting box\nand might not find the right one. But he did not say that. He\nsimply asked repeatedly for assurance that I knew the right address.\nAnd when I returned, he asked again if I had been right about the\n1 Apart from the leaving of his own sealed envelope, Myers strongly advo-\ncated the leaving of distinctive objects concealed for purposes of 'post mortem\nreference. Cf. Proc, vol. viii, p. 248 :\n\" It is an experiment which everyone\nmay make\u2014which everyone ought to make.\"\n\u2014\nEd.\n\f184 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1938\naddress. I told him I had taken it to the hospital porter himself. He\nmade no comment.\"\nAmong different interpretations that can be suggested for this\nexperience, there is the view that an actual unfulfilled intention can\npersist after death, independently of personality, and make an im-\npression upon receptive minds. There seems to be no evidence here\nof an actual intention to send the old fountain pens to the hospital,\nnor would the existence of two packets fit this hypothesis. Miss\nSoUas took the trouble to find out one fact that could be ascertained,\nand wrote : \"I have this morning \" [Feb. 4, 1938] \" made inquiries\nat the hospital. They say they never have collected fountain pens.\"\nThe hypothesis which obviously requires the most careful examin-\nation in respect of its probability is that the father, having dehber-\nately planned to leave material for evidence of survival (the two\ncollections of pens, coupled with a pecuharity that would be remem-\nbered about the sending of silver-paper to the hospital with a\nrepeated, and apparently meaningless, insistence on \" address \"),\nsubsequently effected an impression on the daughter's dream-mind\nso as to connect the remembered pecuharity and the word \" ad-\ndress \" with the boxes of pens which he would have expected to be\nultimately discovered. It is a point to note, on this hypothesis, that\nif the pens had been discovered before a communication could be\nmade, there was no teUing what they were for. The dream, or a\nvariant of the dream, could still have been an explanatory link,\nthough the mind of the dreamer would have appeared more hkely\nto have constructed the evidence.\nIt can be assumed, to avoid a hypothesis of discarnate influence,\nthat the evidence is at fault in this respect : that in fact both boxes\nof pens were noticed and forgotten, so that the dream could be built\nupon a subUminal conjecture and a wish to make it seem true.\nAgainst this must be set the evidence that Miss Sollas is a careful\nobserver who keeps dated notes of an experience. It will be seen\nthat the one lapse of memory to be traced in her contemporary notes,\nprinted below, is the forgetting of a fact which supports the hypo-\nthesis of communicator's intention.\nMiss Sollas sends the following extracts from her contemporary\nnotes, with corroboration of their being a correct copy of the origi-\nnals (these were written only as a personal record, and so were not\nwitnessed at the time) :\n\u00ab\n\" May 22, 1937. Dreamt F. came downstairs to a room which\nmight have been the study of 173 [Woodstock Road], and brought\nme a handful of old fountain pens and asked me to find an address\n\fMarch 1938 Case 185\nto send them to. He went upstairs and came again with another\nhandfuL I asked him did he mean me to sell them for the value of\nthe iridium in the nibs. I could not get clear as to what he wanted.\"\n\" Then,\" Miss SoUas adds, \" the dream continues but the subject\nchanges. There is a marginal insertion by the words '\nanother\nhandful ',\nsaying 'for \" same address\n\"\n\" Dec. 3, 1937. Found, in study, side by side, two cigarette boxes,\none containing silver paper and one fountain pens, labelled '\nold\nstylos '\n(actually they are stylos).\"\nMiss Sollas's first account, printed at the beginning of this case,\nwas, we have seen, in a private letter to Mrs Salter and was put down\nfrom memory. Miss Sollas notes : \"I am surprised that I did not\nmention in my letter to Mrs Salter that the first box I found was\nbeside one of silver paper.\" The point distinctly suggests the laying\nof a trail of evidence, and the arranging of a link to connect the\nprevious sending of silver paper to the hospital with the motive to\nbe inferred for the keeping of old fountain pens.\n\" Dec. 29, 1937. Found in drawer in study another box (same\nkind cig. box as on Dec. 3) also labelled stylos containing old foun-\ntain pens and stylos.\"\nMiss Sollas appends this corroboration :\n\" My friend Mme Pelli\nhas read these extracts and will sign the following statement\n:\n\" I have checked these copies, comparing them with the entries,\nand I find them correct.\n(Signed) M. Pelh.\"\nIt is a very important point that the unconscious and quite\ninnocent \" secondary elaboration \" of a dream-memory should be\ntaken into account, and all cases in which a dream is recalled and\nrecorded after its apparent verification have to be accepted with\ncaution. In this case, dream-notes are on record long before the\nverifying event. It is interesting, however, to note an example here\nof secondary elaboration, and to note also that Miss Sollas has\nobserved it and can explain the occurrence. The point concerns the\nappearance of \" iridium \" in the dream-record and Miss Sollas's\nrecognition of the fact that this was not an element in the actual\ndream. For anyone of less accurate memory, \" iridium \" would have\nbecome incorporated in the recollection of the dream. Miss Sollas\nmakes the following note :\n\" You will see that I have stated in the record that I asked in my\n\f186 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1938\ndream if my Father meant me to sell the pens for the value of the\niridium in the nibs. I know that I did not actually use the word\n'\niridiuin '\nin my dream. It was when I was thinking it over on\nwaking that it occurred to me. I was rather surprised when on con-\nsulting a friend she immediately said they contained that, and I\nsuppose I put it in the record merely in order that if I forgot, I should\nknow in future what might make them valuable. The record was\nwritten only for myself.\"\nIn considering the probability of discarnate influence in a case of\nevidence presumably arranged by the communicator before his\ndeath, it has to be remembered that there is evidence suggesting\ntelepathic leakage, into the minds of automatists, of thoughts con-\ncerning the contents of a sealed envelope, while the person who has\ndeposited the envelope for purposes of post mortem reference is still\nalive. The drawback about the procedure recommended by Myers\nis that the commimicator's intention may take effect, telepathically,\nbefore he has time to become a communicator, and remain latent in\na percipient's mind. But it seems impossible to devise any test of\ncommunications to exclude any and every form of telepathic\nhypothesis ; and it has to be considered, in each case, how far the\nexisting evidence for a fugitive and uncertain form of telepathy\nbetween living minds can bear the weight of explaining what\nappears to be a constructed communication.\nThe easiest normal explanation for the experience would seem to\nbe that Miss Sollas had opened and forgotten the first box of pens, also\nthe accompanying box of silver paper (if we reject her actual view of\nthe facts and form our own view upon her evidence of what might\nhave happened) : that this reminded her of the unexplained peculi-\narity about the errand to the hospital, and led to the construction of\na dream. The second lot of pens, occurring in both dream and\nreality, would then have to be ascribed to coincidence, or else\naccounted for by a further and less probable departure from the\nevidence of the experient. Such an explanation is valid, but depends\non the probability of our conjecture being better than the witness's\nmemory. We have also to consider (a) that the hypothesis of dream-\nevidence constructed ad hoc by the dream-mind leaves the curious\nactions of Miss SoUas's father unexplained, both in insisting on the\nhospital \" address \" and in leaving the collections of pens and of\nsilver paper as he did ; and {h) that in the case of a dream constructed\nad hoc there would be considerable inherent improbability of a\ndelay from May until December before the hypothetical subhminal\ntrickster thought fit to enjoy the success of its plot.\n\fMaech 1938 Correspondence 187\nCORRESPONDENCE\nThe Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities\nTo the Editor of The Journal\nSir,\u2014I can Lionestly plead not guilty to the charge of entertaining\nthe fallacy mentioned by Professor Thouless, nor can I see that the\nlanguage which I used in my letter suggests it. It is true that I\nspoke of a \" positive conclusion \", but I would remind Professor\nThouless of the words which he put into the mouth of his referee, \" I\nmight be able to give you a definite answer.\" It may be taken for\ngranted that everyone understands both \" positive conclusion \" and\n\" definite answer \" in their proper context. Conclusion and answer\nmust be statistical and restricted by the limitations of statistics.\nI am not so innocent and childlike as to cherish the behef that\nstatistics can, in any circumstances, afford certainty : in fact, like, I\nimagine, the majority of people, I am inclined to take the pronounce-\nments of the statistician with a larger pinch of salt than that which\nthey themselves prescribe.\nProfessor Thouless treats us to a ghmpse of the obvious when he\ntells us that the con\\'iction of the hypothetical referee would have\nbeen only slightly alfected by a shght alteration in the figures. How-\never, if it should happen that the values of P in question were round\nabout the arbitrarily fixed standard of significance, this shght\ndifi'erence might have relatively important results. He gives the\nexample of students sitting for an examination ; a difference of two\nmarks passes one while the other fails. A trivial difi^erence, perhaps,\nin their relative merits, but, Oh, what a difference in the result ! One\nmay eventually receive a degree and all the attendant honour and\nglory thereof, while the other remains mere common clay.\nPresumably the staticians mean something when they fix a\nstandard of significance. We all know that it is arbitrary, but surely\nit comes to this, that it is agreed that whatsoever reaches or sur-\npasses the standard of significance shall be considered significant.\nHowever, all this is, as it seems to me, irrelevant to the point\nwhich I raised.\nThe question which I asked was, \" Are we justified in assuming\nthat there is a precise arithmetical relation between the data of j\\Ir\nCarington's investigation and the characteristic which he desires to\nmeasure? \" I am afraid that I cannot see that Professor Thouless\nhas answered, or attempted to answer, that question.\nPerhaps I did not make my meaning sufficiently clear ;\nmay I,\ntherefore, try to remedy this by an example ?\n\f188 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1938\nSuppose an automatic machine tool is being used to perform a\ncertain process, say, a turret lathe to machine up small castings,\nthen, even if the tool itself be accurate, the output will not be\nreliable unless the rough castings are true within the tolerated limits.\nI do not question the accuracy of the mathematical machine ;\nwhat I want to know is whether the raw material on which it works,\ni.e. the data supphed by the word association tests, is reliable within\ntolerated limits.\nIf the turret lathe is turning out shell fuses, the tolerated limits of\nthe finished product would be to the order of a fraction of a thou-\nsandth, and the permissible limits of error in the castings propor-\ntionately small. Were the machine one for turning out broom\nhandles, one could allow much wider hmits in the stock.\nMr Carington's results were all so near to the standard of signifi-\ncance that any lack of precision in the data could not fail to have\ndisastrous results for the reliability of his conclusions. Mr Carington,\nin private correspondence with me, has reproached me for what he\ncalls my passion for astronomical figures. Had the P's at which he\narrived approached more nearly to the astronomical, I should have\nfelt happier as regards his results, as there would then have been\nsome margin for error in the data.\nConcerning the other point which I raised, I note that there has\nbeen no assumption that all words in the lists were of equal value.\nMay I, therefore, in the light of this information, ask one further\nquestion? What was the method used in assessing the different\nvalues of the various words?\nThis is surely pertinent to the enquiry, for, if the words have not\nbeen treated as being of equal value, some must have been rated\nhigher than others, and there seems to be no obviously infalhble\nmethod by which this could have been done.\nAs regards that which Professor Thouless thinks is my main point,\nI need add nothing to the note which you. Sir, appended to his\nletter.\nYours sincerely,\nH. F. Saltmarsh.\nExperiment in Extra-sensory Perception '\nTo the Editor of The Journal\nSir,\u2014The letters of Mr Saltmarsh and Mr Besterman, in your\nissue of January 1938, require separate treatment, although I have\nno intention of being drawn into a long controversy over E.S.P.\nMr Besterman's surprise at my remarks seems quite uncalled for,\n\fMaech 1938 Correspondence 189\nbut his demands for proofs are easily met. The card I examined was\nin Prof. Gardner Mm^hy's laboratory in Columbia University and\nwas taken up in his presence. Moreover, there was really nothing\nsurprising about it, since in the early days Professor Rhine was using\ncards of varying sizes, and had to be persuaded to have them cut\n\" more evenly \". Furthermore, if Mr Besterman cares to call at the\nSociety's rooms, Mr Herbert will doubtless show him the latest cards,\nfor wliich a patent has been applied for by Professor Rhine, and\nwhich are being sold all over the United States (until their crudity\ncompels them to be withdrawn), and he will see what Professor Rhine\nthinks, after seven years' work with E.S.P., are suitable cards for the\nexperiments. Although this blunder may be \" so gross as to be well-\nnigh incredible \", Mr Besterman will be able to study it himself and\nnot have to beUeve me that it exists.\nMr Saltmarsh adopts the now famihar method, used so extensively\nat Duke, of trying to divert criticism from experiments shown to be\nfull of faulty procedure to other experiments, where the same\nobjections do not apply. It is like a case of a chemist, who, having\nclaimed to discover some new material, due to using filthy retorts,\nclaims further investigation of his discoveries by saying that in\nother experiments retorts are not used, but delicate scales, and when\nthese are shown to be faulty turns to something else.\nProfessor Rhine, after seven years' work, does not yet appear to\nunderstand that when the backs of the cards are seen it is advisable\nthat they should be as uniform as possible and not so designed as to\nmake the variations easy to note. As to his other experiments, they\nmay or may not be faulty ; but of course I am unable to say where\nthe fault, if any, hes, without seeing them, any more than I can say\nhow a stage illusion is done without seeing it.\nFinally, I want to make it quite clear that I make no personal\ncharges against any individual or organization. Professor Rhine's\ncards can be seen by anyone at the S.P.R. together with instructions\nfor their use. It is quite clear that he thinks that E.S.P. may be\ndemonstrated through them, even when the backs are visible.\nThey speak for themselves, and if they do not suggest the kind of\nconditions under which E.S.P. is obtained in the United States and\nelsewhere, nothing can do so. I do not deny the existence of E.S.P.,\nand maybe it can only be made apparent under the new methods of\npsychical salesmanship. If so, then we had better receive courses of\ninstruction, and the sooner the better. I shall have much pleasure\nin attending them.\nYours, etc.,\nNew York, Feb. 2, 1938. E. J. Dingwall.\n\f190 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Maech 193S\nKEVIEWS\nSome Cases of Prediction : A Study. Edith Lyttelton. Bell.\n2s. 6d.\nThe cases in Mrs Lyttelton's book are chosen to exemphfy different\nkinds of precognitive experience, from among the many accounts\nsent by listeners after her broadcast in the B.B.C. series, \" Enquiry\ninto the Unknown \". All are corroborated by at least one person\nwho knew of the prediction before it was verified. The predictions\nare classed as showing (1) precognition or chance coincidence,\n(2) precognition or simple telepathy (with chance coincidence highly\nimprobable), (3) precognition or telepathy of a complex and con-\njectural kind, and (4) precognition without much alternative.\nIt is well pointed, out by Mrs Lyttelton, quoting a comment on the\npoint by Mr Tyrrell, that the probability of a few almost incredible\ncoincidences having occurred by chance, in the experience of a very\nlarge number of people (radio listeners form an extensive \" sample \"),\nis an incomplete criterion in these cases. The great majority of\ncoincidences between two events in time are observed after the\nsecond event has drawn attention to the first. In all the present\ncases the first event\u2014an impression or dream\u2014has occurred with\nsome additional feeling that it has significance ; there has been at\nleast the impulse to tell someone, and in some cases to act upon a\npremonition. There is, in fact, some drive associated with the\nimpression, which in greater or less degree forms an energic link with\nthe subsequent event. The proper comparison to have in mind is\nbetween impressions \/e?< to be significant which appear to be verified\nlater, and those which do not appear to be followed by any justify-\ning event.\nIt is important, however, not to assume that the feeling with\nwhich an impression or dream is invested is necessarily concerned\nwith the subsequent event : the feeling may arise from a complex\nof one's own and not from any justified sense of an exterior signi-\nficance. It is a matter of evidence. Two people who dreamed, one\nof them twice, of an airship disaster, both inferring danger to the\nR 101, have produced corroborated records which are interesting to\nstudy. One corroborator says, \" I find this all particularly remark-\nable, in so much that he is not a person who dreams often, and is\nusually quite unaffected by the small events which we are apt to\ncall coincidence.\" Testimony hke this, together with evidence of\nanxiety or action to avert an anticipated event, helps to isolate\nprecognitive cases which are specially worthy of consideration.\n\fMaech 1938 Reviews 191\nUniversity of London Council for Psychical Investigation, Bulletin\nIII (1937) :\n\" Preliminary Studies of a Vaudeville Telepathist.\"\nS. G. SoAL, M.A., B.Sc. With 13 Illustrations, 5s. net.\nThis excellent paper describes a series of tests carried out on\nJoseph Kraus, well-known as a stage performer under the name of\nMarion. He exhibits in a highly skilful form most of the \" mys-\nteries \" which appear from time to time on the music hall stage, and\noften leave the spectator with a pleasing sensation that he nuiy have\nbeen observing something really supernatural.\nThose who have had experience in psychical research are generally\nsceptical about such performances, and sometimes go so far as to say\nthat elaborate investigation of them is a waste of time. But a httle\nreflection will show that this is not so. So httle is known about the\n\" really supernormal if it exists, that it must be the duty of investi-\ngators to give attention to any phenomenon for which no explanation\nis forthcoming, even if the chances of a supernormal explanation are\nmore slender than usual. Again, there is much value in under-\nstanding the methods of what we may call \" mental legerdemain \",\njust as there is in knowing the methods of manipulative conjuring.\nMr Soal carried out a large number of tests, experiments being per-\nformed in the finding of hidden objects, the identification of playing-\ncards chosen by members of the audience, the apparent perception\nof drawings, colours, etc., through sealed envelopes, telepathy, and\npsychometry. As might be expected, the findings are that there is\nno evidence for the possession by Marion of any supernormal\nfaculties. There is a great deal of evidence that Marion possesses\nvery considerable skill. Mr Soal writes in his summary, \" . . . it is\nshown that Marion is able to recognise a new playing card, that he\nhas previously handled, when it has been mixed with several other\ncards of identical make and design. The results strongly indicate\nthat, in this feat, he relies mainly upon his tactual sense and upon a\nstudy of the contact which the card makes with the surface of the\ntable \". This, and other points made by Mr Soal, should be con-\nstantly borne in mind in appraising experiments which claim to\ndemonstrate the existence of a supernormal faculty by means of\ntests with cards.\nThe paper should be read with care by all practical workers in the\nfield of psychical research.\n\f192 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1938\nInternational Institute for Psychical Research, Bulletin IV :\n\" Hori-\nzons of hmnortality and the Subconscious Mind.\n'\n' Baron Erik Kule\nPalmstierna, G.C.V.O. 2s. net.\nThis paper comprises an earnest attempt to discredit the sub-\nconscious mind and its potentiahties, with so sweeping an effect that\nit becomes necessary to restore the abohshed function in other terms :\n\" the soul may somehow influence the character of the messages.\"\nThe concrete point at issue, whether messages that led to the finding\nof the Schumann Concerto were derived from or through an uncon-\nscious process, is only obscured by an inimical attitude towards the\nprocess itself. The evidence for supernormal action in this case\nwould look stronger if the argument did not in effect suggest that\nany automatic action can be accepted as supernormal.\nIt is another matter to follow Baron Palmstierna's method with\nscripts, as exemphfied in \" Horizons of Immortality \" : to preserve a\nreceptive attitude and to judge the discourses received by their\nintrinsic, rather than their evidential, quality.

Associate).\nThe Secretary read the Notice convening the Meeting.\n\f196 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1938\nThe Hon. Treasurer, in presenting the accounts for the year,\nreported that the Society had a surplus of \u00a341 for the year instead of\na deficit of \u00a388 for the previous year. This was not, however, quite\nas satisfactory as it appeared, as the amount spent on the pubhcation\nof Proceedings was much below the average. With Mr Saltmarsh's\nvaluable assistance, the House and Finance Committee had made a\nvery thorough enquiry into the financial position of the Society,\nfrom which it appeared that in a year when printing and other\nexpenses were normal the Society would either have to increase its\nincome by obtaining more Members, or let off part of the Society's\npremises ; or they would have to be prepared to meet a small\ndeficit every year. But for the success in obtaining exemption from\nIncome Tax, they would have had a prospect of somewhat serious\ndeficits in the future.\nSince the House and Finance Committee reported, the Society had\nhad a small windfall ; it was now also receiving income on a legacy\nwhich up to now had paid nothing.\nAs members knew, an Appeal for a capital endowment had been\nmade aboiit eighteen months before, which had met with a very\ndisappointing response. Now that the Society was exempt from\nIncome Tax, it was possible for the Society to take advantage of the\nwell-known Seven Years Plan utilized by most authorities and other\nbodies exempt from tax. He hoped that it might be possible to\nincrease the Society's income by a judicious use of this scheme.\nMr Salter moved the adoption of the Balance Sheet and the\nAnnual Report. This resolution was seconded by Sir Lawrence\nJones, and carried unanimously.\nAfter a discussion on the Report, in which Dr Dingwall, Mr Her-\nbert and Mrs Salter took part, appreciative references were made to\nMiss Newton's long and distinguished services.\nThe Chairman announced that there were no candidates for\nelection to membership of the Council, other than the six Members\nwho retired by rotation and sought re-election. The following six\nMembers were accordingly unanimously elected : Professor C. D.\nBroad, Mr W. Whately Carington, Professor E. R. Dodds, Miss Ina\nJephson, the Hon. Mrs Alfred Lyttelton, G.B.E., and Dr Maurice B.\nWright.\nMessrs Miall, Avery and Co. were re-elected Auditors for the\nforthcoming year.\n\fApeil 1938 Case 197\nCASE : A \\^KIDICAL EECURRENT DREAM\nThe following letter was addressed to the Society\n:\nDear Sir,\u2014On the off chance that your Society may be interested,\nI submit for your consideration the following account of a curious\nexperience that has befallen me. Some few years ago^ I was con-\nstantly having a recurrent dream. In this dream, I went to my\nmother's old desk and took from a spring drawer, which I knew of,\na sum of money which I counted, and then put back. Gradually\nthe amount increased, until on my last dream visit it amoimted to\nsixty pounds. This dream money of mine was a source of amuse-\nment to my wife and sons, and to numerous friends whom I have\ntold about it. Recently^ my sister, whom I had not seen for some\ntime, came to visit us, and I repeated the story of my dream to her.\nAt the time, she made no comment, but the following day told\nmy wife and myself that she had passed a sleepless night, and felt\nconstrained to tell us that just before my mother died, she told my\nsister that she had saved a sum of money to be given to me, which\nwas then in the Post Office. She signed an authorization for my\nsister to get the money, and shortly after passed away. When my\nsister drew this money from the Post Office, she found it was\nexactly sixty pounds. As I was at that time in receipt of a good\nincome, my sister kept the matter to herself, and used the money to\nhelp pay for a trip to Canada to see some relatives.\nAll those concerned are still ahve, and can vouch for the truth of\nthis story.\u2014Yours sincerely, Ernest J.

Each dream was of a house and its\nneighbourhood, which in neither instance appears to have been seen\nby Mrs Calder before the dream occurred. Both dreams were put on\nrecord before verification : and in each instance Mr and Mrs Calder\nwere subsequently recommended to, and moved into, a house\nstrikingly similar to the one dreamed of. In one instance a further\ndetail, a barrel used as a kennel for a black retriever, occurred in the\ndream, and did not occur in reality until new tenants made this\narrangement for their black retriever on coming to the house a year\nafter Mr and Mrs Calder had taken it.\nMrs Calder has recently experienced another dream of a similar\ncharacter, and with a similar outcome. She wrote to Mrs Lyttelton\nas follows :\nMarch 4th, 1938.\nDear Madam,\u2014I was much interested in your book, for which\nplease accept my thanks. It may perhaps interest you to know that\nanother instance of the same kind of precognition has now occurred\nto ine.\nSome weeks ago I had a very vivid dream in which I was moving\ninto a very large old-fashioned house, and was busy hanging curtains\n\fApril 1938 Case 199\nat some extremely Mgh windows. I then wandered out througli\nwild and neglected gardens and found a kind of courtyard bounded\nby walls on three sides, all rather neglected and overgrown, and quite\nunhke any place I knew.\nI described all this to my husband next morning, and wondered\nif it meant another move for us. Strangely enough, a few days\nlater he was offered a new post at Crewe in Cheshire. I naturally\nsupposed that the old house I had seen in my dream would prove\nto be there\u2014as on previous occasions. As it happened, however, a\nparent visiting my husband's school a few days later mentioned\nthat she was thinking of letting half her very large old house, six\nmiles away from here\u2014hidden away in a park, which we had never\nvisited. Eemembering my dream, my husband suggested that we\nshould go and see it\u2014and of course it was exactly as I had described,\nwith the courtyard easily recognisable ;\nvery high windows, etc.\nYet, at that time, we supposed that we should be going to Crewe,\nand it is the more remarkable that circumstances have now arisen\ncausing my husband to refuse the move to Crewe and remain here.\nWe felt so drawn to the old house seen in my dream that we have\ntaken half of it and expect to move into it very shortly\u2014after having\nlived for the last seven years in our present house (also seen in a\ndream before coming to it\u2014as in your book).\nI cannot pretend to account for this strange precognition of the\nhouses in which I seem to have to live, but I am quite content to be\n\" guided \" in this way, and feel a strange sense of security as a result.\nWe were most interested in comparing the experiences of others\nwith our own, in your book.\nYours very truly,\nA. M. Fyson Calder.\nI have pleasure in confirming all the statements made by Mrs R. B.\nCalder in this letter.\u2014R. B. Calder, 4\/3\/38.\nCORRESPONDENCE\nExperiment in Extra-Sensory Perception\nTo the Editor of The Journal\nSir,\u2014Several experiments recently made, both in this country\nand in America, have been referred to as \" repetitions \" of those\ncarried out by Dr Rhine : but I should like to point out that the\nword \" repetition \" in this connexion is a misnomer, which is in-\nclined to lead to false expectations. No experiment can properly\n\f200 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1938\nbe called a repetition of another unless all the relevant conditions of\nthe original have been reproduced in it ; and there is no evidence\nthat this has ever been done where experiments in extra-sensory\nperception are concerned. Indeed, in the present state of our\nignorance, it is diificult to see how any experiment in E.S.P. can\nbe \" repeated \". Many imponderables, outside the physical con-\nditions obtaining in the laboratory, are of crucial importance for\nexperiments in psychology and still more for experiments in psychi-\ncal research. For instance, there is the unique personal influence\nexerted by the experimenter on his subjects. There is the factor of\nthe group-moral of a working team\u2014an intangible thing, it may be\nsaid, yet an intangible which makes all the difference between the\ndefeat and victory of an army. There is the spirit pervading a\nplace\u2014a university or perhaps a country : and there is the spirit\nof an age. The latter produced dramatic poets in the 16th century\nand surreahsts in the 20th, and by no possibiUty could the order\nof these products have been reversed. But they were produced\nby an \" intangible \".\nHow can factors such as these be dismissed as irrelevant when we\nare engaged in the deUcate task of trying to raise subUminal know-\nledge through the motor-mechanisms of the body, the route being\nevidently hedged about by inhibitions, which are linked up with\nunknown systems of associations ? They are obviously main factors :\nthey are as much essential conditions for experiments in E.S.P. as\ntemperature, mass or velocity are for experiments in physics. If\nthey are not reproduced when experiments in E.S.P. are \"repeated\",\nthen the experiments which are being called \" repetitions \" are\nbeing done under circumstances which are merely a selection of the\nessential conditions, some of these essential conditions being\narbitrarily ignored. In physics, if experiments were \" repeated\n\"\nin this way, it would be quite easy to demonstrate that petrol-\nengines will not work ; that compasses do not point to the North ;\nthat the law of the pendulum is untrue and so on. I do not suggest\nthat such experiments as are now being carried on are unimportant,\nbut only that it is inaccurate to call them \" repetitions \". It is a\nfalse nomenclature which causes self-confusion and leads to un-\njustifiable expectations.\u2014Yours etc.,\nG. N. M. Tyrrell.\nSir,\u2014I hold no brief for Dr Khine and his work ;\nindeed, though I\nhave great admiration for him and for what he has done, I am far\nfrom endorsing the recent commercialisation of his investigations.\nEven here, however, I can understand his motives. The only reason I\n\fApril 1938 Correspondence 201\npursue this discussion is because the comments recently printed in\nthe Journal by Dr Dingwall and others may lead some students to\ndiscredit Dr Rhine's results on inadequate grounds.\nThe criticisms to which I refer are based on the fact that the cards\nissued by the Parapsychology Laboratory of Duke University,\nthrough a publisher, are inadequate for experiments in which the\nsubject sees or touches the cards. It is quite true that this is so, but\nit is equally true of all cards and of all objects used under the same\nconditions\u2014a point which must not be forgotten. In short, this\ncriticism is only a roundabout way of saying that no telepathic or\nclairvoyant experiment is fully vahd if the subject sees or touches the\ncard or other object. This is hardly a starthng addition to our\nknowledge of the subject ; it is not a fact of which Dr Rhine is\nunaware ; and it is a fact which is brought out even in the very\nelementary commercial pubhcation which accompanies the Duke\nE.S.P. cards. Siirely it would be fairer to make these facts clear\nwhen criticising Dr Rhine in such tendencious terms as are used by\nDr Dingwall?\nYours, etc.,\nTheodore Besterjvian.\nSir,\u2014I, for one, would Uke to ask pardon, on behalf of those of\nus who happen to value tolerance and common courtesy, of our\nfriends and co-investigators in America for the abusive and\u2014as I\njudge them\u2014largely unfounded and scarcely justifiable expressions\nof Dr Dingwall. And I do so with the less hesitation since my\nown observations upon telepathic and clairvoyant phenomena, now\namounting to some hundreds of carefully observed spontaneous and\nexperimental examples, collected during twenty years or more,\ngenerally confirm the main contentions of Dr Rhine and his col-\nleagues, working on more statistical lines. Indeed, no amount of\ndeclamation of the \" sour grapes\" variety can possibly shake the\npersonal observations and convictions of those who have been into\nthese questions sufi&ciently impartially and comprehensively.\nMy set of cards is a plain (white) backed set, made by the Atlantic\nPlaying Card Co., N.Y. Personally, I should prefer coloured or\nfinely patterned backs, so far as avoidance of identification marks is\nconcerned ; and a very large number of packs (still better, new\npacks for each trial) should be used, if the same subjects are to be\ntested many times over, and any marked cards rejected at once.\nIn any case, there is no sense or justice in suspecting, as does Dr\nDingwall, that Rhine's psychology students and friends were all\n\f202 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Apeil 1938\npotential criminals and card-sharpers. The regrettable thing is that\nsome enquirers seem to have caught the spirit of fraud and dupUcity\nfrom the so-called mediums that it has been their misfortune to\ninvestigate\u2014where, indeed, their sole aim has not been criminal,\ninvestigation rather than psychical research. And by that I do not\nmean that one should not be always as guarded and critical as is\nhumanly and scientifically possible ; for there is, surely, no need\nto dwell upon that fundamental point of method after all these years\nof pain and disillusionment.\nI am, yours very truly,\nJ. Cecil Maby.\n[It seems that no useful purpose will be served, at this stage, by\nfurther correspondence on the E.S.P. experiments. Further investi-\ngation of facts is required, and the Society is having special cards\nprinted for detailed research into points that have come under dis-\ncussion.\n\u2014\nEd.]\nThe Subconscious Mind\nSir,\u2014It seems an over-simphfication of the real issue when your\nreview states that I have taken up \"an inimical attitude \" towards\nthe belief in a \" subconscious mind \" and the use of that very obscure\nterm. With your kind permission I will try to explain in as few\nwords as possible a reason for my somewhat unorthodox behaviour.\nIt is to my mind a pity that so many and influential psychical\nresearch workers still remain attached to what that expression is\nsupposed to signify, and continue to stick to a hypothesis wliich\nalready is getting out of date and soon will be registered as a thing\nof the past.\nIn the early period of the Society's work great emphasis was laid\non elforts purporting to reconcile and harmonize psychical research\nwith the actual views and methods of the older sciences at the time.\nBiologists in those days, following the lead of physical science, in\nwhich field matter was shown to be an association of atoms, built\ntheir work on parallel lines, and the \"Association theory\" was\nestabhshed. The functioning of life in a biological sense was\nexplained as an interaction of hving cells and their environments.\nPsycho-physiologists followed them, and mind became a resultant\nof the parts which constituted the human being.\nWhen psychical research went into action the modern psycho-\nlogical schools were engaged in delving into the Unconscious part of\nthe mind, an agency previously dealt with by Kant, v. Hartmann\nand Schopenhauer, and the possibility of a parcelhng up of the\n\fApril 1938 Correspondence 203\npsyche, dividing it into separate \"layers of the mind\", was tested.\nThe human soul began to look like a chest of drawers stuffed with\nheterogeneous but very active material. Labels were given to these\nlayers and the \" subconscious \" was introduced among other hypo-\nthetical agencies which replaced the imity of the soul, an attitude\nwhich never was generally approved of by philosophers. It is\ninteresting to note that Freud did not approve of the use of the\nterm. A change of view has set in, however, since that earher period.\n\"Hohsm\"\u2014to borrow an expression of General Smuts and use it\nin a wide sense\u2014has been recognized as presenting supplementary\nor better explanations for the functioning of life. A unifying and\ncontrolHng element appears, directing the scattered factors, and\nthe Gestalt theory contests the evidence of the associationists.\nAmong psychologists, the therapeutic workers seem to be the first\nto vindicate the unity of the soul in its normal state and men like\nGroddeck and Jung bear out the necessity of a change of front. The\nsoul which had been spht up is visuahzed as a distinct unit, a whole,\nparts of which are illuminated by beams of consciousness which\ncannot, however, reach beyond the \" movable threshold of sensi-\nbility \" which prevents a grasp of the indivisible whole extending\non the other side of the threshold. We have rightly named this\nextension a region of the Unconscious, because temporarily we are\nshut out from complete knowledge about it. But \" the self is not a\nduaHty, it is a unity \", as Dr Geley so strongly emphasized.\nWith an acceptance of the soul's unity the many layers of mind\nvanish, and new vistas open up indicating the spiritual nature of\nexistence, and the everlastingness of the individual soul, its pre-\nexistence and permanence.\nIt seems to me that if psychical research workers disentangle\nthemselves from the obscure network of separate agencies of the\nmind, and, in step with the progress of science, embrace the factual\nunity of the soul, the road to progress would come in sight and the\nforces of rehgion rally to their neighboiirhood.\nThis is, briefly stated, one of the reasons why I find it advisable\nnot to hnger any longer by the \" subconscious mind \" or allow it to\ndistract us from the way of obvious advance.\u2014Yours sincerely,\nErik Palmstierna.\n[It is possible to regard the mind as a whole, while still observing\nthat its functions can work in groupings more or less independent\nof the whole, as in automatism. The acceptance of all unconscious\naction as springing from the unity of the soul would be far from\nthe views held by any school of psychology.\n\u2014\nEd.]\n\f204 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1938\nOBITUAEY\nDr F. C. S. Schiller, F.B.A., whose death at Los Angeles last\nAugust was recorded in the Journal for October, was elected an\nAssociate of the Society in 1884 and was transferred to Membership\nin 1897. He was co-opted a member of Council in 1901 and became\nan elected member in 1909. He was President of the Society for\nthe year 1914, and was a Vice-President from 1920. He resigned\nfrom the CoutlclI on account of ill-health in 1935.\nHis chief contributions to the Proceedings are \" On Some Philo-\nsophical Assumptions m the Investigation of the Problem of a Future\nLife \" {Proceedings, Vol. xv) ;\n\" The Answers to the American\nBranch's Questionnaire regarding Human Sentiment as to a Future\nLife \"t {Proceedings, Vol. xviii) ; and his Presidential Address\n{Proceedings, Vol. xxvii). In addition, he contributed numerous\nreviews to the Proceedings (Vols, vii, xv, xvii, xxv, xxvii, xxix,\nXXX, xxxi, xxxii, xxxiii, xxxiv, xxxvi), and to the Journal, to which\nhe was also a frequent contributor of cases.\nDr SchiUer's removal in 1929 to a Professorship of Philosophy in\nthe University of Southern California, and latterly his advancing\nage, had gradually withdrawn from the Society the co-operation of\nan acute and a critically speculative mind. Like another past\nPresident whose thought has helped to illuminate the path of\npsychical research. Professor WilUam James, Dr Schiller was a\npragmatist ; and whatever the value of pragmatism as a guiding\nprinciple in philosophy, it is an attitude of real value in the theory\nand practice of a science that must continually apply the test of\nworking significance to its explorations.\nThe same quaUties that made him an enUvening teacher of\nphilosophy, in his Oxford days, gave freshness and felicity to his\ntouch upon the problems of psychical research, and he is to be\ncounted among those who have infused into our work the philo-\nsopher's habit of giving obvious facts their proper appHcation.\nIn our present gropings towards efi&cient statistical treatment of\nevidence, it is worth while to remember Schiller's accurate dis-\ncrimination between this type of evidence and the historical type\n(\"a historical event occurs once \"), and the balance which he\nmaintained between their respective values. At the same time, he\nfound value for research in that exercise of the trained imagination\n(\"to prepare the way for science by ingenious guessing \") which\nlies at the opposite pole from easy and uninteUigent conjecture ;\nand brought into his own imaginative ventures a touch of critical\nhumour that was a refreshing characteristic of all his work.\n\fApbil 1938 Obituary 205\nBooks and articles by Dr Schiller included in the S.P.R.

Phoebe Payne. Faber. 7s. 6d.\nThose who habitually experience visual and other sensory impres-\nsions of things outside the normal range of perception do not often\nseem able to give a coherent account of the extended faculties that\nthey believe themselves to possess. This book is worth attention as\nan imusually balanced and thoughtful study of these apparently\nparanormal faculties, by an experient who makes practical use of\nthem. Miss Payne has a gift for intuitional diagnosis, works in the\nservice of the medical profession, and obtains results that seem not\nto be due to ordinary observation and inference. Whether or not we\nprefer the conservative view that her mind is so constituted as to\nexternalize its impressions in unreal sensory forms, the fact and the\nusefulness of the impressions remain. And the human \" aura \" in\n\f206 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1938\nparticular, if it is a visual hallucination, is a hallucination that takes\na curiously constant form for the people who report its existence.\nExperiments might be devised to test the uniformity of these\nimpressions, as they are reported by different sensitives with the\nsame series of subjects. But the actuality of auras is not a primary\nconsideration in Miss Payne's study, and can be taken, if we so wish,\nas representational imagery which makes it easier to think and talk\nabout the types of psychical experience that she discusses. She is\nparticularly interesting in a distinction between \" negative \" and\n\" positive psychism \" which should be of considerable value to people\nwho are experimenting upon apparent mediumistic faculty in their\nown persons. The \" negative \" type belongs to a distinctive per-\nsonal make-up, and involves a liability to delusive phenomena, ab-\nsurd and unsatisfactory purporting communicators, and so on.\nProper control of the function can bring it into closer and closer\napproximation to the less common \" positive \" type, in which a\nfaculty of discrimination, not to say an active apprehending of such\nexperience as seems to have significance and value, produces not only\nbetter results but a better effect upon the personality.\n\" Undoubtedly \", Miss Payne writes, \" there is a certain vitality,\nstimulus, and subtle satisfaction, whether born of reality or fantasy,\nresulting from psychic experience, and there are as yet few sensitives\nsufficiently impersonal to scrutinize deliberately the whole field of\ntheir experiences and dissect it without bias. If they could appre-\nciate the fact that the world needs their real contribution, it would be\neasier for them to strip their experience of its unreality and estimate\nit at its true worth.\"\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS\nRevue Metapsychique, Nov.\u2014Dec, 1937.

The Lord\nCharles Hope in the Chair.\nThe Research Officer, Mr C. V. C. Herbert, spoke on recent work\ncarried out by the Society. A part of his report is summarised below,\ncomprising an account of the methods devised in testing two dif-\nferent cases of ostensible paranormal faculty. A summary of\nanother section of his report, deahng with the examination of\nspecimen Zener cards of two patterns that have been used at Duke\nUniversity, is printed on p. 215 of this issue, under the heading\n\" Experiment in Extra-sensory Perception \".\nFROM THE RESEARCH OFFICER'S REPORT\nIndividual Tests op Paranormal Faculty\ni\nMr Herbert described a test of seeming prediction carried\nj\nout by the Society. The subject. Miss X, approached the Society ]\nin June of last year, stating that she was convinced that she pos-\nsessed the faculty of predicting the winners of horse races by means\nof a symboHc method. Before the race she would take careful note\n\fMay 1938 Report 211\nof any unusual images which suggested themselves to her mind,\nand would then examine the lists of runners in the race, where she\nwas generally able to find certain names which corresponded with\nthe symbols. She suggested that (1) these selected horses proved\nto be winners more often than if they had been chosen by chance,\nand (2) that the fact that she was usually able to find names cor-\nresponding with her symbols (obtained before consulting the lists)\nwas in itself significant of paranormal faculty. She wished these\nsuggestions to be scientifically tested, and freely placed herself at\nthe disposal of the Society.\nThe difliculty of testing claims in connection with contests involv-\ning skill and ability lies in the fact that the chances of any given\nresult cannot be predicted by mathematical methods\u2014if there are\nten competitors in a race, the chances of any given one winning are\nobviously not 1\/10, some being much more likely to win than others.\nBut as regards horse racing, there are published in connection with\neach race a series of probabilities, the starting price odds, which are\nobviously related to an expert estimation of the actual probabilities.\nOne assumes that the Ring assess the probabilities to the best of\ntheir abihty, and then offer odds which are less than these estima-\ntions by an amount representing the margin of profit which they\nallow themselves. As regards horses which have a very small chance\nof winning, the Ring never offer enormous odds, although some\nhorses must be almost infinitely unhkely to win ; and as regards\nhorses which have a very great chance of winning, the odds originally\noffered are often reduced or shortened if the public is found to be\nbetting extensively on these horses. From tlois it would seem\nprobable that as regards horses which are either very likely to win\nor very unlikely to win\u2014hot favourites and rank outsiders\u2014the\nstarting price odds represent a smaller proportion of the actual\nexpectations of winning (as assessed by the Ring) than do the start-\ning price odds for the other horses.\nIn order to compare the starting price odds with the actual\nresults, the following experiment was carried out. Six days' racing\nwas selected at random (1937, November 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9) ; in\neach race two horses were selected from the lists of probable starters\nin The Times. These were selected by pure chance, the horses being\nnumbered and two of the numbers being drawn from a bag. It was\nassumed that each horse so selected had been backed with one imit\nto win and one unit to obtain a place. It was assumed that in the\nevent of a win, the full starting price odds, as quoted in The Times,\nwould be paid, and that in respect of the horse gaining a place {i.e.\nfinishing 1 st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th) one quarter of the starting price odds\nP 2\n\f212 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1938\nwould be paid.^ The wins and losses were then calculated in respect\nof all the horses which actually ran. Horses which did not run\nwere completely left out of account. In fact, 54 of the horses\nselected actually ran, thus making 108 hypothetical betting trans-\nactions. The result showed a net loss of 8J units. It was calculated\nthat if the starting price odds actually offered had been increased\nby 10 per cent., the final result would have shown a zero loss. This\nsuggests that the starting price odds do in fact represent very fairly\nthe actual chances of the horses.\nMiss X's predictions were received on forms specially prepared\nfor the experiment. On these she wrote the name of the meeting\nand the names of the horses selected by her for the various races.\nWhen we received a form the postmark on the envelope was ex-\namined, and if it showed a time later than the time of the race, the\npredictions were ignored. If the postmark was in order, the wins\nand losses were calculated as in the previous experiment. Forms\nwere received between 1937, October 27, and 1938, January 5.\nThese contained a total of 154 runners, a sample nearly three times\nas extensive as that used in the chance experiment. The result\nshowed a net loss of 114 units. If odds 10 per cent, greater than the\nstarting price odds were assumed (which in the chance experiment\nsufficed to reduce the loss to zero) a loss of 99 units was still shown.\nIn order to reduce the loss to zero, odds of 50 per cent, greater than\nthe starting price odds would have to be assumed.\nThis looks at first sight as if Miss X possessed a negative pre-\ncognitive faculty, i.e. that she selected losers instead of winners\n;\nbut an examination of her actual selections shows that she had a\ndistinct preference for hot favourites and rank outsiders as opposed\nto the more moderate horses, so that she would receive more than a\nchance selection of unusually poor odds\u2014if the theory of the assess-\nment of the odds above stated is valid.\nIn order to test the suggestion that the symbols recorded by Miss\nX appHed to actual names in the lists of probable starters more\noften than would be expected by pure chance, a third experiment\nwas performed. Her symbols for fifteen days' racing were selected at\nrandom, together with the names of the horses selected by her. The\nsame symbols were then compared with the names of runners in the\nraces on the same days of the week a fortnight later. It was found\nthat equally good correspondences could be found. It was con-\ncluded that the names of runners are so numerous and so varied\n1 This is the usual arrangement, but is departed from in practice if the\nfield is very small ; it is nearly enough true for the purposes of the experi-\nment.\n\fMay 1938 Report 213\nthat it is likely that any fairly general symbol would apply to any\nday's racing.\nThere seems therefore to be no reason to suppose that Miss X\npossesses either a faculty for selecting winners or a faculty for pro-\nducing symbols which apply to the names of runners more aptly\nthan is explainable by chance.\nIn concluding his account of this investigation, Mr Herbert men-\ntioned a curious incident which was recorded during the course of the\nwork. Miss X sent a postcard to the Society, postmarked, \" 1937,\nDecember 17, 10.45 a.m.\", on which was written, \" Symbol for to-\nday, December 17th (seen at 12.15 p.m. last night), A dead horse (pre-\nsumably), covered over, but lying stiff, with legs outstretched.\" At\nthe Windsor Meeting on December 17 a horse called Terse was\nseriously injured. Describing this the Daily Mail Eacing Corre-\nspondent writes as follows {Daily Mail, 1937, December 18) :\n\" Terse, however, moved away on three legs, and was found to be\nso badly injured that he had to be destroyed.\" Though such\naccidents sometimes happen, they are not by any means common.\nNo other reference to a dead horse could be found in any of Miss X's\nrecords of symbols. It must be remembered, however, that this\nsymbol was given in the ordinary way, as a symbol to suggest the\nnames of winners, and not as a prediction of an accident. It was\nascertained that no accident had happened during the week previous\nto the writing of the post card, such as might have suggested this\nsymbol to the subject.\nMr Herbert showed shdes of graphs giving the results of the\nchance experiment, and the actual test with Miss X.\nMr Herbert then described a series of experiments with a subject,\nMrs S., on divination with a pendulum\u2014mostly in connection with\nmap reading. Mrs S. came to the Eooms during January of this\nyear saying that she possessed a faculty of determining the sex of\nthe writer of a letter by holding a pendulum over an envelope con-\ntaining the letter. If the writer was a man, the pendulum swung\nwith a circular clockwise motion, if a woman, the rotation was anti-\nclockwise. A side-to-side swing indicated that the writer had died,\nor was connected with death or morbid matters. Mrs S. very kindly\nconsented to some experiments being tried.\nFor the first test, 20 letters were placed in similar envelopes, 10\nfrom men and 10 from women, half of each being still alive and half\nbeing dead. The envelopes were weU shuffled to prevent telepathic\nor other clues being communicated to the subject by the experi-\nmenter. Mrs S. obtained 19 successes and 13 failures. For the next\nexperiment 20 envelopes were used, all from living persons. The\n\f214 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1938\nletters were taken at random from the correspondence files, and\nconsisted of 13 from men and 7 from women. With 2, no reaction\nwas obtained ; with the rest, Mrs S. scored 9 successes and 9 failures.\nIt was suggested that Mrs S. might obtain results in distinguishing\nbetween land and water areas on a map, and a rough test was made\nwith pages from an atlas covered over with sheets of blank paper.\nThis was sufficiently promising to warrant the carrying out of more\nformal experiments. Accordingly three maps were traced from an\natlas on to thick cartridge paper. The drawing was covered with a\nsheet of blotting paper, over which was placed a blanlc sheet of\ncartridge paper. These were fixed together with paper chps all\nround. The drawing could not be seen through the paper unless\nthe whole was held up to a strong hght. Pressing the cover sheets\nwell down on to the drawing (which will often reveal the contents\nof an envelope) gave no clues as to the arrangement of the map.\nThe test was carried out by Miss Newton, who did not know what\nthe maps represented. Mrs S. held the pendulum (which consisted\nof a gold ring on a cotton thread) over the blank cover sheet, a\ncircular swing indicating land, and a side to side swing indicating\nwater. The cover sheet was marked in pencil by Miss Newton in\naccordance with the movements of the pendulum. The results\nseemed distinctly suggestive of some faculty of divination.\nAt the next experiment, larger sheets were used (at the subject's\nrequest), three maps being prepared. Tests were carried out by\nMr Herbert and Mr Richmond. Here again, there seemed to be\nsome indication of a paranormal faculty. After the experiment was\nfinished, the three maps and the three marked cover sheets were\nmixed together and were submitted to Miss Newton, who was asked\nto say which cover sheet applied to which map. The orientation of\neach sheet was indicated, but otherwise no extraneous clues, so far\nas is known, were supplied. Miss Newton correctly indicated which\nsheet applied to which map. Two other people were asked to do\nthe same thing, and were equally successful. A fourth person\nplaced one cover sheet correctly, but transposed the other two.\nAn experiment was then tried with fifty small sections of maps,\neach representing land or water only, enclosed in separate envelopes.\nThe subject made no significant score with these. An examination\nof the guesses in relation to the actual disposition of the envelopes\nshowed that she has a distinct preference for guessing alternately\nland and water.\nAs Mrs S. seemed to be disheartened by the result of the envelope\nexperiment, no more tests of this sort were attempted. Further\nexperiments were made with large maps, with the object of getting\n\f]\\Iay 1938 Report 215\nthe subject to accept a fictitious map instead of a map of an actual\ndistrict. Three maps were prepared in which the water areas were\ncoloured blue and the land areas brown. Two of the maps repre-\nsented actual districts, and the third was a fictitious map. Miss\nNewton superintended the test, which again seemed to show\nevidence of paranormal faculty. The fictitious map was the most\nsuccessful of the three.\nThe next stage was to rule the cover sheet for each map in squares,\nand to suggest to the subject that it would make the scoring easier\nif she did her divination square by square. The two real maps of\nthe last experiment were used again, with new cover sheets, squared\nas described, and for the third, a fictitious map was prepared in\nwhich the boundaries of the land and water areas followed closely\nthe fines of the squares on the cover sheet. Each square was thus\nalmost all land or almost all water. The subject appeared to have\nno difiiculty in keeping to the squares. Although the fictitious map\n(which was the first of the three to be attempted) did seem to show\nsome correlation with the marks on its cover sheet, when counted\nup, square by square, no significant result could be foimd. It would\nappear that the faculty, if real, was not precise enough for such a\ntest to succeed ; i.e. that a feature of the map might produce a\ncorresponding mark on the cover sheet, but sufiiciently displaced\nto be outside the correct square. Further experiments were devised\nand prepared, but, unfortunately, the subject went abroad before\nthe test could be carried out. It is hoped to continue the experi-\nments when she returns.\nEXPERIMENT IN EXTRA-SENSORY PERCEPTION\nI. A Note on Types of Zenee Cards used at Duke University\nAs is well known, the cards used for the \" E.S.P.\" experiments\ncarried out by Professor J. B. Rhine and other American investi-\ngators are of the type known as Zener cards. Instead of the usual\nplaying-card symbols, each card bears one of five special symbols :\ncross, rectangle (or square), star, wavy lines, and circle.\nIn considering these cards, and their suitabiHty for serious experi-\nmental work, we can recognise two main types of card : (1) those in\nwhich the Zener symbols were added to standard playing card blanks\nby means of stencils or rubber stamps ; and (2) those which were\nspecially made for the work by a manufacturer of cards.\nAs regards the first class, two specimen packs, each consisting of\n\f216 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1938\n25 cards (5 of each symbol), were sent to Professor Thouless hj\nProfessor Khine some two years ago, as samples of the actual cards\nused in the tests at Duke University. Professor Thouless examined\nthese cards very carefully, and came to the conclusion that while\none pack was unobjectionable, the other suffered from the serious\ndefect that in many of the cards the symbol on the face could be\nread from the back. Professor Thouless was kind enough to send\nme this pack for examination, the result of which is as follows. The\nblank stocks used are of excellent quahty. The backs have a plain\ngreen panel surrounded by a gilt Une ; this again is surrounded by\na narrow white border extending to the edge of the card. The Zener\nsymbols are added to the blank face of the cards, presumably by\nmeans of a rubber stamp.\nAt a first glance the backs seem to be quite unmarked, but if\nexamined by a good hght reflected from the back of the cards, the\nsymbols can in many specimens be read with ease. Thus with the\nlight from a window (not direct sunhght), 9 cards could be identified\nwith certainty. With a 60-watt electric lamp hanging from the\nceihng 64 inches above the table on which the cards were placed,\n14 cards could be identified. And with a powerful electric lamp\n(1000-watt projection lamp) 20 cards could be identified.\nThe explanation seems to be that the instrument used for adding\nthe symbol to the blank card has the effect of shghtly embossing the\ncard. The symbol thus appears on the back in shght relief, and\nwhen hght is reflected from the back of the card this raised image\nshows up against the flat background. With some of the cards, the\neffect is so pronounced that it can clearly be seen in a photograph\ntaken in a strong hght which is reflected from the back of the\ncard.\nAs regards the second class of card, i.e. those with the symbols\nadded by the card manufacturer, presumably by a Hthographic\nprocess, two different packs were produced, and were placed on\nthe market in the U.S.A. They were put up in unsealed packets of\n25 (5 of each symbol), on which was printed \" E.S.P. Cards for\ntesting Extra Sensory Perception, developed in Parapsychological\nLaboratory at Duke University, patent apphed for by J. B. Rhine \".\nOne pack had the symbols in black, and the other the symbols in\ndifferentiating colours. These cards are illustrated and referred to\nin the Journal of Parapsychology for September, 1937. A critical\nexamination of these cards shows that they fall very far short of the\nhigh standard which might reasonably have been expected.\nTwo packs, one with plain symbols and the other with coloured\nsymbols, were carefully examined to see if they shared with the pack\n\fMay 1938 Experiment in Extra-Sensory Perception 217\nof stamped cards sent to Professor Thouless the defect of legibility\nfrom the back. With artificial hght, ordy a few of the plain cards\nand none of the coloured cards could be read ; but when held at a\ncritical angle so as to reflect the hght from the sky, a position could\nbe found in which nearly every card coidd be read with ease from\nthe back. An expert on card manufacture has told me that this\nis due to the ink from the hthographic image on the face of the\ncard drawing in the surface of the back so that a shallow depression\nis formed. He said that this could always be expected in cards with\nheavily inked hthographic symbols and a smooth \" plate finished\n\"\nback.\nThe design on the back of these cards (blue and white for the\nplain packs, and brown and white for the coloured packs, but\notherwise the same in both) shows in the centre a circular picture\nof a Gothic tower, across which is written \" E.S.P.\". This is sur-\nrounded by a circular inscription, \" Developed in Parapsychological\nLaboratory at Duke University \". Round this is a comphcated\npattern of curved white hues. Because of the picture and lettering,\nthe cards have a definite \" right way up \" ; i.e. in a mixed pack\nsome of the towers will be the right way up, and others upside down.\nThis seems unnecessary, as possibly disturbing to a sensitive sub-\nject, and also as making it easier in some tests for an unscrupulous\nsubject to cheat by arranging the cards beforehand (ordinary shuffl-\ning would not alter the relative orientation of the cards). The fact\nthat the picture and inscription are surrormded by a dark ring,\nwhich could suggest the circle, might also disturb a sensitive subject\nand influence his guesses. There seems to be no reason for the pic-\nture and inscription (except that of advertisement), and a less sug-\ngestive design would surely have been preferable.\nA further serious criticism of the cards seems to he in the\npattern of white lines which covers the backs except for the area\noccupied by the picture and inscription. This extends right up to\nthe edges, and owing to inevitable shght variations in the amount\nof pattern shced olf by the cutting machine in trimming the cards\nto size, the pattern, as cut olf at the edge, varies noticeably in dif-\nferent specimens. In some cards this variation is very marked\nindeed. A large proportion are, ab initio, what a bridge player\nwould call marked cards. Thus, in the pack with uncoloured sym-\nbols, four of the cards (out of 25) when placed with the picture on the\nback upside down, showed a conspicuous white marking in the left-\nhand top corner which was absent from the other 21. In all four the\nsymbol happened to be a circle. As the pattern extends right to the\nedges of the cards [i.e. they have not the narrow white margin which\n\f218 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1938\nis usual in English packs) these differences are clearly visible when\nthe sides of the closed pack are inspected. The edges have a vary-\ning distribution of white and colour. Thus the four \" circles \" men-\ntioned above can be clearly identified by looking at the edges of the\nclosed pack of 25.\nThe possible effect of the use of such cards on the results of experi-\nments naturally varies greatly according to the particular technique\nemployed. The cards sent to Professor Thouless would obviously be\nhighly unsuitable for any tests in which the subject could see the\nback of the card before making his guess. The complete bona fides\nof the subject would not necessarily be any safeguard, since he might\neasily be influenced towards a correct guess by unconscious observa-\ntion of the symbol appearing on the back of the card. In experi-\nments in which the experimenter alone saw the cards, no damage\nwould be done, except that there might then be a possibihty of the\nexperimenter himself recognising the cards unconsciously and trans-\nmitting his information to the subject by means of sensory clues,\nunconsciously given. In telepathic experiments, in which the cards\nare known to the experimenter, he is naturally continuously on his\nguard against such leakage ; but if he was recognising the cards\nwithout realising that he was doing so, such special precautions\nwould seem quite unnecessary, and leakage might possibly take\nplace. As regards the packs in which there was no symbol showing\non the backs, but where the backs were obviously different in dif-\nferent specimens, leakage would only be possible if the subject, and\nto a lesser extent the experimenter, had had the opportunity of\ncomparing the backs and faces consciously or otherwise. In experi-\nments in which the subject and experimenter were in different rooms,\ndefective cards would obviously have no effect whatsoever, unless\nit were a condition of the experiment that telepathy was ex-\ncluded.\nAny danger of leakage resulting from the use of defective cards\nwould obviously be greatly minimised as soon as the experimenter\nwas aware of the imperfections, and as regards future work at\nDuke University we need have no uneasiness on the score of cards,\nsince Professor Rhine in a recent letter states that \" the only way\nto test E.S.P. from now on is to make it impossible for imperfect cards,\nnowever produced, to be of consequence \". No doubt, in future\nreports. Professor Rhine will record the precautions observed to\nensure this condition.\nC. V. C. Herbert.\n\fJIay 1938 Experiment in Extra-Sensory Perception 219\nII. The Fisk Effect\nIn the experiments reported by Mr Tyrrell in Proceedings, Vol. XLIV,\nPart 147, the essence of the procedure is that an operator selects a\nlong series of numbers within the range of 1 to 5, either by random\nchoice or by the use of mechanical means for obtaining a chance\nselection ; and the percipient, without normal clue to the selection,\nattempts to make a correct guess at each number in turn.\nThe \" Fisk effect \", discovered by Mr G. W. Fisk after a quantity\nof these experiments had been carried out, shows that if an experi-\nmenter, acting as \" percipient \", goes on choosing the same number\niintil the \" guess \" is successful, then continues in the same\nway with a second number, and so on, the proportion of suc-\ncesses obtained is significantly above chance expectation, so\nlong as the operator is selecting the numbers by his own random\nchoice.\nThe reason for this is that an operator, trying to select numbers\nentirely at random, tends to avoid repetitions of the same number.\nIf he repeated the same numbers as often as they would be repeated\nin a true chance-distribution, the experimenter with the Fisk method,\nduring these repetitions of a number, would have one chance in five\nof scoring repeated successes, and four chances in five of scoring\nrepeated failures. It is therefore to the advantage of his score to\nmake use of repeated numbers while the operator does not, if the\noperator, by dodging from one number to another, will in fact hit\nupon the repeated number oftener than he would if he were himself\nusing the chance proportion of repeated numbers. Examination of\nresults showed that this was the case.\nIn the following memorandum, Mr Fisk develops certain con-\nsiderations with regard to random choice, and extends the discus-\nsion to the possible unconscious reactions of an operator to a per-\ncipient's choice of numbers, when the operator is employing random\nchoice. Mr Tyrrell permits the use in the Journal of two letters\nin which he has commented on the relevance of the points at issue to\nsome of the actual experiments ; and Mr Fisk makes a reply to Mr\nTyrrell's comments.\nMemorandum on Mr TyrrelVs Pointer Apparatus\nWhen experimenting with Mr Tyrrell's new E.S.P. electrical\nrecording machine it was found possible, under certain conditions,\nto obtain, by \" trick \" methods, scores of the same order as those\n\f220 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1938\nobtained by Miss Johnson. Mr Tyrrell dubbed these methods of\nscoring the \" Fisk Flexible \" and the \" Fisk Rigid Systems \".i\nWith the same systems it was also found possible to make high\nscores with Zener cards\u2014again under certain conditions.\n^\nRegarding Mr Tyrrell's original Pointer Apparatus, it was agreed\nby other experimenters and myself that with it the Systems could\nnot be used without the operator becoming immediately aware of\nthe fact,^ and, consequently, the discovery of these trick methods\ncould have no bearing on the 30,000 odd trials with Miss Johnson\nthat Mr Tyrrell had conducted with that apparatus.\nA reconsideration, however, lead me to suspect that that was not\nnecessarily the case. To test the matter I made a duplicate of the\nPointer Apparatus and conducted a series of trials with different\npercipients.\nThe Fisk Systems took advantage of the tendency of the operator\n,\nto distribute his choice more evenly among the five boxes of the\nmachine than pure chance would do.* Hence if a percipient con-\nTimaes to open the same box successively for several trials until a\nsuccess is scored, he would not run the risk of having to wait so\nlong as he would do were the operator's choice truly random, as\nwhen, for example, an unbiassed mechanical selector is used. The\npercipient scores therefore because the operator is, paradoxically,\ntoo impartial and, being on his guard against showing any preference\nfor any particular box or boxes, spreads his choice too evenly over\nthe scale.\nNow since with the Pointer Apparatus the operator sees the choice\nof the percipient, we assumed the Systems could not be used with-\nout immediate detection. Only with the electric recording machine,\nwhere the percipient's success or failure is not necessarily immedi-\nately known to the operator, would the Systems be workable.\nThat is true as far as it goes. The percipient could not use the\nSystem without detection\u2014but what about the operator He could\nuse a System to determine his choice of box for the insertion of the\npointer without the percipient becoming aware of the fact. And is\nit not safe to assume that the percipient, hoping to make a good\nscore, also strives to be \" impartial \" in his choice in exactly the\nsame way as the operator? Will he not tend to spread his guesses\nmore or less evenly over the scale, neglecting no particular box or\nboxes, as might be the case were a \" mechanical guesser \" used?\nThe operator, therefore, can take advantage of this \" even spread\n\"\n1 Proc, Vol. XLIV, Part 147, p. 154.\n^ Loc. cit., p. 113.\n^ Loc. cit., p. 161.\n* Loc. cit., p. 157.\n\fMay 1938 Experiment in Extra-Sensory Perception 221\nby successively inserting the pointer in the same box until the per-\ncipient scores a success. The operator will then pass on to another\nbox, either in rigid or haphazard order, and let his pointer stay\nthere imtil the percipient scores the next success.\nActual tests show that the operator can by following this System,\neither wholly or in part, increase the percentage of a percipient's\nsuccesses to a remarkable degree. Tests with five different per-\ncipients gave the following results :\nPercipient Conditions No. of trials % successes\n17\nr.r. Ordinary 1900 27-9\nPre-selected Nos. 800 21-5\nSystem, rigid 700 29-7\nM.B. Ordinary 200 23-0\nSystem, flexible 200 41-0\nE.T.

They were typed in groups of five on a sheet that could\nbe fastened on the operator's side of the screen. I memorised the\nfirst ten groups to avoid any delay in inserting the pointer. Actual\nnumbers were :\n51144 3 5 535 44524 52333 52552\n11545 15144 51132 25344 22213\nAlternatively the simple code 13542, 53124 was used.\n\f222 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1938\nThe System used (except in the trials with F.F.) was the flexible\none. After a success was scored the operator chose for his next\nbox the one that appeared to him most neglected.\nIt will be seen that with pre-selected numbers all percipients\nscored chance results only. The best score under these conditions\nwas that of M.B. with 3% above chance for 200 trials\u2014a neghgible\ndifference.\nWhen the System was used scores were very high and would give\nan artificial \" x \" value of approximately 18-4, which would mean\nprobabihty odds against \" chance of almost astronomical pro-\nportions.\nIt is remarkable, however, that when the operator tried to use\n\" ordinary conditions \" percipients still scored well above chance.\nAt first I thought this might indicate some measure of E.S.P., but\nI now think that having once realised the possibihty of System\nscoring it became impossible for me to make anjrthing like a random\nselection. Unless I worked dehberately against the percipient by\nfollowing him, as it were, a step or two behind his guesses, I could\nnot but take advantage of his tendency to \" even spread \". Con-\nsidering the results with the pre-selected numbers I do not think\nany of my percipients showed any genuine E.S.P. I found it quite\neasy to make the percipients score high or low as I wished.\nNow it is not necessary to point out that none of the experimenters\nwith the original Pointer Apparatus knowingly employed any such\nSystem as described above. But the question is\u2014could they have\nunconsciously used such a system partially, but sufiiciently to affect\nthe results? I beheve that is not only possible but even likely.\nLet us consider in more detail what is actually happening on the\noperator's side of the screen. He sees in front of him five openings\ninto one of which he has to insert the pointer. Suppose he selects\nopening No. 4. He inserts the pointer and calls out \" In \", or makes\nthe other chosen signal to inform the percipient that he must now\nchoose his box. Suppose the percipient hfts lid No. 5. The operator\nrecords the failure on his score sheet. Now he selects an opening\nfor Trial 2. At random he inserts the pointer in No. 3. The per-\ncipient lifts hd No. 4. He has failed again. Haphazardly the\noperator inserts the pointer in No. 1. But is it still an entirely hap-\nhazard selection? I think it can be argued that the selection is no\nlonger entirely free from bias. He has seen the percipient open two\nboxes (5 and 4) on his\u2014the operator's\u2014right-hand side of the\napparatus. He is doing his best to give the percipient a fair trial,\nand does not wish to favour him in any way. It is natural, there-\nfore, although he may not consciously consider the point, to select\n\fMay 1938 Experiment in Extra-Sensory Perception 223\nfor the third trial a box away from where the percipient seems to\nbe hovering, so, with or without conscious vohtion, he puts the\npointer into a box on the left\u2014No. 1 or 2.\nBut what about the percipient? He has failed twice at one end\nof the scale. What more natural than for him to have a shot at the\nother end? He opens, therefore, No. 1 or 2.\nThere would thus appear to be two tendencies that interact. A\ntendency of the percipient to spread his guesses evenly over the\nscale and, after failure, try his luck at a box he feels he has been\nneglecting for some time. A tendency of the operator to \" dodge\n\"\nthe percipient by selecting boxes that are not being favoured by\nhim. Neither percipient or operator will consistently follow these\ntendencies, the strength of which will vary with different persons ;\nbut I think it is a serious error to regard each separate trial as being\nentirely distinct from its neighbours, fore and aft. There is a link\nbetween them all, and therefore the probabiHty of success for any\ntrial in a series (except for the first) will not be exactly one-fifth.\nTo obtain rehable results, therefore, both with the Pointer Ap-\nparatus and the Electrical-recording machine, it would appear neces-\nsary to employ either pre-selected numbers or a mechanical selector.\nG. W. FiSK.\nFebruary 10, 1938.\nIn correspondence with the Research Officer, Mr Tyrrell made the\nfollowing comments :\nI\nMarch 27, 1938.\nDear Herbert.\u2014The following remarks occur to me about Mr\nFish's paper, which I return. Naturally, after he discovered a way\nof utihzing the method of free, random selection chosen by the\noperator so that the chance-expectation of success coidd be raised,\nI used mechanically selected numbers. But I do not think that the\nearher results either with the Pointer Apparatus or with the Electrical\nApparatus are imder any reasonable suspicion. In order to get\nsuch results as he describes in his paper, it is necessary to\nknow about the Fisk method, and either to use it deliberately\nor else to have become so inoculated with the habit of using it as to\ndo so unconsciously. (See his own statement, on p. 222, opposite :\n\" Having once reahsed the possibility of System scoring, it became\nimpossible for me to make anything like a random selection.\")\nMr Fisk goes on to say in his paper :\n\" Now it is not necessary to\npoint out that none of the experimenters with the original Pointer\n\f224 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1938\nApparatus knowingly employed any such system as described above.\nBut the question is\u2014could they have unconsciously used such a\nsystem partially but insufficiently to effect the results? I believe\nthat it is not only possible, but likely.\" The experimental results,\nhowever, teU strongly against this.\n(A) Take the Table of Results with the Pointer Apparatus pub-\nlished in Proc. xliv. pp. 109-10. 30 subjects were tested with it, of\nwhom 2, only, scored significantly above chance, viz. Miss Johnson\nand Mrs Hemingway. (Mrs B. -Moore was perhaps on the border.)\nNow take Mr Fisk's two theories, (a) that the percipient used the\nFisk method, or alternatively (b) that the operator did so.\n(a) would not account for the result on Mr Fisk's own showing, for\nhe says on p. 1 of his paper :\n\" The percipient could not use the\nSystem without detection\u2014but what about the operator?\n\"\n{h) 28 out of the 30 subjects did not score above chance. Here are\nthe figures for the 28 : Trials = 35, 100 ; Successes = 7,252 ; X= 3 ;\nP = approx. 0-001. No one would take this as significant in E.S.P.\n2 did score above chance. Here are the figures for the 2 : Trials =\n9,500; Successes = 2,340 ; X=ll. This is vastly significant, of\ncourse.\nNow what does Mr Fisk maintain? Experiments with the two\nscorers were intermingled with experiments with the non-scorers.\nHe must maintain that each time I came to Miss Johnson or Mrs\nHemingway, I used the Fisk system unconsciously, and each time I\ncame to one of the other 28 I avoided it. Is this plausible?\n(B) But actually I carried out an experiment with Miss Johnson\nat Bedford College with some criticism of this sort in view. Here we\nused an \" every-trial \" recorder with ten pens, I selecting at random\nin the usual way as I had done in the successful trials above. The\nten-pen recorder would have showed \" Fisking \" if it had been used\non her part. The result was exactly what pure chance would give.\nThis I anticipated, because the new method (she was pressing keys\ninstead of opening boxes) and the strange surroundings would be\npretty sure to inhibit results. The results were: Trials = 1,600 ;\nSuccesses = 333 ; D = + 13.\nBut what is Mr Fisk's argument? Apparently he must maintain\nthe following : (i) That I unconsciously used the Fisk method with\n2 subjects (including Miss Johnson), and avoided it with the other\n28. (ii) That I unconsciously dropped it when Miss Johnson worked\nin new surroundings. And what about the other operators with\nwhom Miss Johnson scored?\nI do not think that any of this is in the least plausible. His\nsystem is something quite artificial, which no one ever uses until it\n\fMay 1938 Experiment in Extra-Sensory Perception 225\nhas been pointed out to him, and in my own case apparently not\neven then. His own results are evidently to be explained by his\nhaving ingrained the system so firmly into his own mind that he\ncould not get rid of it.\nOf course, Mx Fisk might say that although Miss Johnson did not\nuse the System on the Pointer Apparatus, she did so every time she\ncame to the electrical apparatus ; but this again is unplausible.\nWhen she was told about it and did try it, it came into hopeless\ncompetition with her own way of scoring by subconscious impulse\nand brought her scores down to chance.\nYours sincerely,\nG. N. M. Tyrrell.\nII\nMarch 29, 1938.\nDear Herbert.\u2014The further points about Mr Fisk's arguments\nare :\n(1) When, with the Pointer Apparatus, I experimented with 29\nsubjects (exclusive of Miss Johnson), only 1 of them scored. The\nothers got 20%.\nWhen Miss Johnson experimented with 7 operators other than\nmyself, she scored with 6 of them.\nIt is very remarkable that I, as operator, should have refrained\nfrom using the Fisk method with 28 out of the 29 subjects (especially\nas the experiments were mixed together on various days), while at\nthe same time 6 quite new operators out of 7 should have used the\nmethod at once with Miss Johnson. In fact, I do not see at all how\nit can be suggested that this is plausible.\n(2) The triangle of results was as follows :\n(i) Miss Johnson scored with me when I was the operator. I\nthen (according to Mr Fisk) must have been using his method with\nher with the Pointer Apparatus.\n(ii) Miss Johnson scored with certain other operators, A and B,\nother than myself. They, then, were using a Fisk method.\n(iii) A and B, as subjects, with myself as operator, failed to score\nabove chance. What happened then? Either, I suppose, we all\nthree gave up using the method, or we all went on using it, and some-\nhow cancelled each other's effects out so exactly that the results\nwere chance scores. Both these suggestions strike me as being\nfantastic.\n(3) As was brought out in the report on my work in Proc. XLIV,\npp. 99 ff., each new condition introduced in the electrical apparatus\n\f226 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1938\ncaused Miss Jolinson's score to fall to chance at first, but it picked\nup subsequently. This happened when we passed from the Pointer\nto Lamps and when we commutated the wires to the lamps, for\ninstance. What connection is there between an abandonment of\nthe Fisk method of pressing keys or opening boxes and such innova-\ntions as these? The same thing happened when visitors were first\nintroduced.\n(4) At Bedford College I took some records of my own system of\nfree choices and some of Miss Johnson's on the ten-pen recorder\nwhich shows each choice, and there was definitely no sign of the\nrepetitions of the same number, which Mr Fisk's method demands.\nNor was there in the cases of the other students who acted as sub-\njects and had their free choices recorded. In fact, the positive\nevidence does show that (a) free choices pitted against one another\ndo, in the great majority of cases at any rate, give 20% averages,\nand (6) that people do not use the Fisk method unless it has been\nsuggested to them.\nYours sincerely,\nG. N. M. Tyrrell.\nNote on Mr Tyrrell's Remarks\nI quite appreciate Mr Tyrrell's point that it is difiicult to under-\nstand why only Miss Johnson and Mrs Hemingway scored signifi-\ncantly with the Pointer Apparatus and 28 others failed to do so if\nthe same operator was unconsciously using the Fisk System. Pos-\nsibly Mr Tyrrell's subconscious self was playing pranks and wanted\nMiss Johnson to score and the others to fail. This seems very far-\nfetched, but the tricks that Miss Johnson's subconscious self seems\nonly too ready to play when any change is made in the conditions\nof the experiments (e.g. lamps for pointer, etc.) confirm a suspicion\nthat subliminal selves generally are enfants tres terribles, and up to\nall manner of mischief to upset our serious investigators. I am not\nin the least maintaining that in the case of Miss Johnson (and pos-\nsibly Mrs Hemingway) there was no genuine exhibition of E.S.P.\nMy own personal opinion (which is worth exactly nothing) is that\nMiss Johnson does possess a genuine E.S.P. faculty. But I am\nmaintaining that it is impossible to prove it with the Pointer Ap-\nparatus so long as the operator selects the boxes at his own sweet\nwill. I think that my figures show that the method leaves a door\nopen for the intrusion, conscious or unconscious, of \" Fisking\n\"\nwhich vitiates the so-called proof. The points that Mr Tyrrell raises\nmay show that it is probable that there was no \" Fisking \" in the\n\f\u2022May 1938 Experiment in Extra-Sensory Perception 227\noriginal experiments. I am inclined to agree with him. But prob-\nability is not enough. We want Mr Tyrrell to produce an absolute\nproof, and to do that there must be no possibility of \" Fishing \" on\nthe part of either operator or percipient. I think that Mr Tyrrell's\nelectrical recording apparatus when used with a mechanical selector\nsecures that condition.\nG. W. FiSK.\nREVIEWS\nEJvidence of Personal Survival from Cross CorrespondetKes. H. F.\nSaltmarsh. Bell (\" Psychical Experiences \" Series). 3s. (3d.\nnet.\nMany people, who are well equipped to discuss the evidence in\nmost branches of psychical research, fight shy of the subject of\ncross-correspondences. It is treated as a \" highbrow \" region of\nresearch, requiring scholarship for its proper appreciation. In point\nof fact, where Uterary and classical allusions are concerned, once a\nscholarly investigator has identified and explained the contexts there\nis Httle demand upon the student except for sustained attention.\nHuman dislike for this efl^ort is, however, much fortified by the habit\nof regarding \" the classics \" as a specialised and a formidable sub-\nject. Also, the sense of being on unfamihar ground makes the\nstudent feel that he is being led blindly. Many people experience\nsimilar feehngs, and a similar psychological resistance, at the mere\nsight of figures in quantitative research.\nMr Saltmarsh's short epitome and discussion of typical S.P.R.\ncross-correspondences and their significance makes a general grasp\nof the subject many times easier. It is a model of clear condensation\nand dispassionate exposition, and opens up a direct pathway for the\ninquirer. A brief and fair statement of the estabhshed probabihties\nconcerning paranormal faculty is followed by a sufficient description\nof the automatists concerned. We then have the \" Plan of Cross-\nCorrespondences \" simply explained, and chapters follow giving\n\" simple \" and \" complex \" examples. The latter are most ably\nsummarised, though Mr Saltmarsh remarks that in the process\n\"it is quite certain . . . that a good deal of the evidential value\nhas been lost. In a way this may not be altogether a bad thing\n\"\n(he adds), \" for it can be fairly said that I have not overstated my\ncase.\" The last phrase prompts the comment that the statement\nthroughout is in the spirit of judicial summing-up and not of\nadvocacy.\n\f228 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1938\nA further study is made of the highly interesting \" Statius \" and\n\" Ear of Dionysius \" cases\u2014both better known by their titles than\nby their content\u2014which, though not strictly examples of evidence\nbased on cross-corresponding clues, are in a similar category in their\nappearance of being puzzles set by a communicator for solution by\nthe verifiers. It is, indeed, a relevant procedure to set the evidence\nof design in these cases alongside of the evidence of design furnished\nby cross-correspondences. If there is method in both, it is one\nmethod with variety of application. Mr Saltmarsh speaks of\n\" strong evidence \" of design ; as he has suggested in his intro-\nductory chapter, and re-afiirms in his concluding discussion, \" the\nscientific method cannot yield certainty \" ; but it fulfils its function\nwhen, as here, it reveals the true grounds of hypotheses, and\nclarifies our judgment of the reahty and meaning of evidence.\nThe Psychic World.

Methuen. 12s. 6d.\nThe publishers do this book a disservice, in the eyes of serious\nstudents, when they describe it in capitals on the dust-cover as \" A\ncomplete, readable and fully documented history of the entire field\nof psychic phenomena \". It is not a history, and is not presented as\none ; nor does it make the least pretension to cover the entire field.\nIt is a collection of studies, and of articles assembled from Mr\nCarrington's contributions to different journals, on a number of\ntopics with which psychical research is concerned ; a Part II, about\none-third of the whole, being devoted to \" Psychic Phenomena\namong Primitive Peoples \". The latter section makes some attempt,\nin a hundred pages, to include a little of everything from a great\nmany geographical sources, and contains perhaps the most interest-\ning matter in the book, though the practices of some of the peoples\nwho are mentioned receive rather scanty and superficial attention.\nIn the earher portion, a chapter on \" The Psychology of '\nSpirit\nCommunication ' \" gives, at least, material for psychological con-\nsideration. Mr Carrington describes how he obtained and kept a\nsealed letter for the purpose, eventually, of post-mortem refer-\nence.

Journal for February last (Annual Report,\np. 160) an inquiry was started by the Society in 1936-1937, at my\nsuggestion, in order to ascertain whether any phenomena of witch-\ncraft had come under the notice of Belgian Roman Cathohc mission-\naries in the Belgian Congo. It had seemed to me, in connection with\n\fJune 1938 Witchcraft in the Belgian Congo 231\na missiological congress held at Louvain, in August 1936, where\nquestions concerning witchcraft had been discussed at length, that\nsuch an enquiry might yield interesting results.\nA circular was therefore drawn up by me in French, and also\ntranslated into Flemish. A statement by Father Martindale, the\nwell-known Jesuit, endorsing the projected investigation, was\nincluded in the circular.\nThough some 275-280 copies were sent to as many different\nmissions, only two answers have as yet (April 1938) been received.\nI will summarise these two answers in some detail, adding that the\nPierre Ngomi case (to be described below) seems to me to remind us\nof the celebrated Urbain Grandier case (seventeenth century ; see\nLegue, Vrbain Grandier et les possedees de Loudun, 1880). In this\ncase an unfortunate priest, accused of having bewitched some nuns,\nwas duly burnt ahve on August 18th, 1634. We may congratulate\nNgomi on living in the twentieth century, which, in spite of many\nhorrors and cruelties, has as yet seen no such auto-da-fes !\nThe following is a summary of the first of the two answers,\nreceived from Father A.B. of C. near D., Kasai, Belgian Congo.\nExtraordinary occurrences are spoken of among the Kasai natives\n(where Father A.B. has resided since 1919) every day. He says that,\nscientifically speaking, these may be due to trickery nine times out\nof ten, whilst it is almost always impossible to prove the authenticity\nof the tenth case. In some cases, such as occurred in one region\nof Kasai, poison may have explained the apparent possession by\nwizards of supernormal powers of murder.\nThe undoubted fact, however, remains, of which every missionary\nwith some experience of the Belgian Congo is aware, that all natives.\nChristians included, are convinced that supernatural events, due to\nsome mischievous influence, do occur, and this though almost all\nthe missionaries, \" a few old men excluded \", have always tried to\nimpress upon the natives that such events have no real existence.\nThe native Christians remain, however, of the same opinion as before.\nHow are we to explain it? In 1921, Father Six, now Vicar Apostolic\nat Leopoldville, expressed his conviction that \" marvellous facts do\noccur \", though adding that it is difficult to say what really happens ;\nand \" In any case the Blacks are convinced of the reality of witch-\ncraft, and this conviction has yet to be explained psychologically \".\nTwo classes of wizards do not attempt to conceal themselves :\n(1) fathers who curse their married daughters ; (2) native chiefs of\nthe \" leopard \" cult.\nA black girl has married a native ; her father is dissatisfied, but\nshe refuses to return to the paternal home. Her father then curses\n\f232 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1938\nher, either pubhcly or privately ; she is to have no more children.\nAll the women are convinced that in such a case she will bear children\nno more. Having observed many such occurrences, Father A.B. is\ninclined to believe that the curse operates in nine cases out of ten.\nAlmost always the woman's husband contrives to arrive at some\nunderstanding with the father ; a certain ceremony is performed\n\u2014\nkukslebola\u2014to remove the curse\u2014and then, Fr. A.B. believes,\nchildren are born in at any rate half the cases. Such things take\nplace every day. Can they all be explained scientifically by chance\ncoincidence ?\nWe now coine to the \" leopard \" witchcraft. This is of two kinds.\nThere is first the \" chief's leopard \". For years Mutombo Nxole\nand the great Baluba chiefs of Lubilashi were in the habit of giving\nto subordinate chiefs a leopard's skin or some leopard's teeth, to be\ncarried in public. The lesser chiefs persuaded their subordinates\nthat they alone were entitled to wear that skin, and claimed in this\ncoimection supernatural powers, such as driving away wizards, and\nprotecting the villagers against calamities. In consequence, a kind\nof cult began to surround the \" leopard \". Certain strange occur-\nrences are related in this connection ;\nthey are, however, less remark-\nable than the operation of the paternal curse which has been de-\nscribed.\nThen there is the \" leopard \" of secret sorcery. All the natives\nare aware of the following facts. A native of bad character wants\neither to become rich, or to get rid of some person he dislikes. He\ncomes to an agreement with old sorcerers ; these assemble in a\nforest, make a leopard-shaped basket out of palm leaves, various\nrites are performed, the new wizard eats human flesh, designates a\nmember of his family as victim\u2014then enters the basket and becomes\na \" leopard \" himself. As such, he will now steal women and goats\nand sell them. Other wizards make a small statue which will also\nbecome a \" leopard \".\nActual leopards do not attack men as a rule ; still there may be\nexceptions, and sometimes these take an epidemic character. How\nare we to explain such cases? Fr. A.B. examines some natural\nexplanations put forward and rejects them. The following case, he\nsays, is personally known to him. In 1917 or 1918 leopards attacked\nmen frequently in the region of Bakwa Mhaye, Kasai. One day,\nTshisanga Lukous, chief of the local tribe, growing old, produced his\n\" leopard basket\n'\"\nof palm leaves, and burnt it in public, saying,\n\" I do not wish to kill more men \"\n;\nwhereupon the attacks ceased\nat once. But soon leopards began ta attack men in other regions,\nand in 1920 such attacks greatly extended, the Bakwa Mhaye\n\fJtTNE 1938 Witchcraft in the Belgian Congo 233\nremaining henceforward immune. The whole region, some 60-70\nkilometres long, was struck with terror. Leopards were to be\nseen everywhere, kilHng an average of one man a day, and roving\nin the \\'illages at night. Various rites were performed to get rid of\nthem, without avail. Then the Cathohc missionary of the region,\ngrowing indignant, Avent from one tribe to another setting fire to the\nkombos built by the natives, in the hope of putting an end to the\nleopards' depredations. He was taking a great risk ; should the\nleopards kill ^actims in the callages where he had fought the anti-\nleopard rites, he would be held responsible. The position of the\nmissionaries might become dangerous, and, in any case, the work of\nevangehsation would suffer. As a matter of fact, the campaign\nmade by the missionary coincided with a similar decision of the\nLusamco Tribunal ordering the destruction of all the kombos, as\nreprisals in connection with the murder of a white man.\nStrange to say, since then leopards have not claimed a single\nhuman victim in the whole region. This is a fact well known to all\nthe natives, as Fr. A.B. can certify. It is another matter to find a\nscientific explanation which w^ould be admissible.\nFr. A.B. concludes by expressing his high consideration for those\nwho devote themselves to the scientific study of such problems. We\nthank him sincerely for his courtesy.\nThe second letter consists in a copy of a report sent by the pre-\ndecessor of the missionary who is our correspondent. The former\nwrites in January 1931 from a place situated near Matadi, on the\nnorth shore of the Congo river.\nIn May 1930 three pupils of the native girls' school began to suffer\nfrom nervous crises of an epileptiform type. They were at first\ntreated as patients, without any success. At the end of June the\ncrises assumed a character very different from epilepsy, and the\ndisorder affected thirteen persons. The first symptoms were vertigo\nand violent palpitations. The girls would then fall down, burst into\ntears, and presently get up and run, still howling, all in the same\ndirection, towards a particular dam in the vaUey of Senya.\nThe missionary (the author of the report) felt convinced that these\noccurrences were due either to hysteria or auto-suggestion. The\ncrises took place only when the girls were together either at church,\nat school or at work. One day the missionary threatened to lock\nthem up in the mental hospital ; and during the ten days spent at\nthe mission by Dr Spyson, a physician, no crisis whatever occurred.\nThe missionary learned later on that the mothers of five of the\npatients had secretly brought them to a certain Kanga known as a\n\" fetishist Kanga made them drink a concoction of green leaves\n\f234 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1938\n\u2014and charged them 25 francs. After this treatment no crises took\nplace for a month. In November, however, he recommended that\nfive married women should join the \" possessed \" girls. More violent\nscenes than usual ensued, the patients attempting each time to run,\nin their paroxysms, towards the above-mentioned Senya dam. Be-\ning detained by those present, they would again fall to the ground,\nmuttering various names incoherently ; one name, however, con-\nstantly occurred, which they pronounced syllable by syllable, mak-\ning contortions of the limbs and facial muscles as they spoke it. The\nname was that of a native called Pierre Ngoma, who had been living\nat K. (where the mission is) for some twenty years.\nOn November 28th, as the girls were leaving school, one of them\nwas seized with convulsions, then got up and ran towards Pierre\nNgoma's house, where she again fell on the ground and began to\ncall to him by various names. The native in question was working\nnot far off with other men. He joined the group which had formed\nitself round the girl, and said that if he ever again heard a girl pro-\nnounce his name in a fit, he would break his stick over her ribs. The\ngirls present dispersed, and none of them experienced any attack\nfor a considerable time. On learning of these facts the missionary\nsubmitted them all to an interrogation in order to ascertain the\nexact role played by Pierre Ngoma. Out of thirty-three, only two\ntimidly \" expressed the opinion \" that the cessation of their attacks\nwas the consequence of Pierre's threats. All the others stated that\nthey knew nothing either as to the origin of their illness or the\nreason for its leaving them.\nThen, a fortnight having elapsed and no crises occurring, the\nopinion began to prevail that Ngoma was a wizard. A local native\nchief wearing a medal conferred by the government {chef medaille)\ntold the missionary that the girls would noAV speak, as they felt\nreassured and feared Ngoma no more. They were therefore ex-\namined once more, twenty-five (out of thirty-three) declaring before\nthe missionary and the chief that Pierre Ngoma was the responsible\nperson, \" adding at the same time, as if they had learned a lesson\nby heart \", that during their crises it was Ngoma they heard caUing\nupon them. Then, they said, he would appear to them, his left hand\nbeing rubbed over with lime and his right hand with powder of red\ntree-bark {mpemha tuJmla) and invite them to come to the place\nwhere, instead of the dam, they would now find a big and beautiful\nvillage. They said they felt irresistibly attracted towards him, and\nexplained in this way their compulsive attempts to run in this\ndirection ; but they were unwilling or unable to explain how Pierre\nhad managed to hypnotise them all to such an extent.\n\fJune 1938 Witchcraft in the Belgian Congo 235\nA meeting was then held, at which two ecclesiastics were present\nbesides the missionary ; the chef medaiUe and various other petty\nnative chiefs were brought together, and the thirty-three females\nwere called, also Pierre Ngoma. The missionary communicated to\nthem the results of his investigation. The chef medaille asked Pierre\nNgoma to explain what had happened, and the latter delivered\na speech of an hour's duration in eloquent terms. He main-\ntained that he had had nothing to do with the matter. If, on a\ncertain day, he said, he got angry with the girls, it was because they\nhad grossly insulted him. He said that he did not know why their\nattacks had ceased.\nThe chef medaille then held a consultation with the petty chiefs,\nthe result being that they decided unanimously to ask the Matadi\nadministrator to expel Pierre Ngoma for ever from the region as\n\" undesirable \". The latter repUed he had expected such a sug-\ngestion, but was ready to defend himself before anybody, as God\n\" who has created my heart and knows what is taking place in it,\nknows me to be no wizard \" {ndohi).\nThe report so obUgingly sent us by the missionary ends here, and\nwe know nothing as to Ngoma's subsequent fate.\nCASE : A PHANTASM SEEN BEFORE THE DEATH\nOF A FAMILY FRIEND\nMr J. Eraser Nicol of Edinburgh, a member of the Society,\ncommunicated this case to the Research Officer, who has\nobtained confirmation of the facts from Miss Kitty Brunton, the\nexperient, and her parents.\nThe following is Miss Brunton's account of her experience, as sent\nin the first instance to Mr Fraser Nicol. Writing from memory,\nshe mentions four days as the interval between her A^sual impression\nof a friend's face, and the time of her seeing the announcement of\nthis friend's death. On her own verification of the details, the\ninterval appears to have been six days. The point does not materi-\nally affect the evidence.\n\" IMr Cuthbert Taylor was a friend of my father for about six or\nseven years.\n\" The only time I met him, however, was on a Sunday in May,\n1935, when he paid us a visit, and I discovered that we had many\ninterests in common ;\nthe principal bond being a deep love of\nmiiSic.\n\f236 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1938\n\" Mr Taylor was a schoolmaster for some time in a lonely hamlet,\nnear Oban ; then he went to the quiet village of Tweedsmuir. near\nMoffat.\n\" I never saw Mr Taylor again, but when I was preparing a\nlecture on music for 8th October, 1935, he was often in my mind,\nand only the train journey from such an inaccessible place prevented\nme from inviting him to this lecture.\n\" On October 19th, 1935, which is the anniversary of my aunt's\ndeath, I went as usual to visit her grave in Grange Cemetery,\nGrange Road, Edinburgh. Before I could reach the grave, however,\nI was held up wlxile a long funeral procession passed by. A young-\nman whom I knew had died suddenly. As I stood there, I wondered\n'\nWho will be the next to die? '\nWhen the funeral had passed,\nI walked on and laid some flowers on my aunt's grave ; then\nascending to the high ground, which crowns a line of vaults, I\nsuddenly saw a vision of Mr Taylor's face. I was greatly startled,\nespecially so as the vision persisted in front of me all the way\nhome, and I at once told my father and mother, wondering if there\ncould be anytliing wrong.\n\" Four days later we were greatly shocked to read the announce-\nment of Mr Taylor's death in the Scotsman. I went to his funeral,\nwalking behind the cortege with his sister, to whom I made myself\nknown, and she told me that her brother had only been ill for a\nfortnight.

Maxwell Telling, M.D., F.R.C.P., was a member of\nthe Society from March 1918 until his death on 28 April last, aged\nsixty-three. He Avas one of the most distinguished physicians in the\nNorth of England, and will be greatly missed by innumerable\npatients and friends. Born in Surrey, he graduated at the Univer-\nsity of London, and worked for a short time at Guy's Hospital. At\ntwenty-three he moved north to Leeds, where he spent the remainder\nof his life, holding many posts. He made a record by holding suc-\ncessively three professorships in the University of Leeds\u2014Thera-\npeutics, Clinical Medicine, and Forensic Medicine\u2014and was, for\nsome time, Senior Honorary Physician to the Leeds General Iw-\nfirmary. During the war he had charge of one of the large hospitals,\nwith the rank of Lieut. -Colonel in the E.A.M.C. His private con-\nsulting practice was, of course, large. He was a Freemason, a\nmagistrate, and was engaged in many social activities. He was a\nfine and many-sided character ; interested on the Ughter side in\nmusic, philately and gardening. In the later part of his life he took\na special interest in psychotherapeutics, and many a patient owes\nthe repair of a broken life to him. But he always sought material\ncauses first. One patient had been an invaHd for sixteen years,\nentirely confined to the house, when Dr. Telling made the first\ncorrect diagnosis ; the patient recovered. Dr. Telling refused to\ncharge this patient any fee, because he had made his acquaintance\nin a friendly way and not through the usual professional channels.\nThis was characteristic of the man's humane and generous attitude.\nDr Telling became interested in psychical research over twenty\nyears ago. His chief motive was sheer scientific curiosity ; he began\nto read widely, and to investigate. Eventually he came to the con-\nclusion that the facts justified a belief in survival and communica-\ntion. This enabled him to give comfort in many cases of hopeless\nillness. And it provided him with a basis for a scientific religious\nbelief. But he never made any sacrifice of a proper scepticism. He\nscrutinised the evidence, and woidd not go beyond it. He satisfied\nhimself before he passed on his comdctions. He became Vice-\nPresident of the local Psychic Society, and, three months before\nhis death, he delivered in Leeds a remarkably full yet concise\naccount of his convictions on the whole subject of psychical re-\nsearch ; a statement courageous yet critical. Dr Telling is a\nloss to the S.P.R., for his influence was all on the side of careful\ninvestigation.\nJ. Arthur Hill.\n\f238 Joimial of Society for Psychical Research June 1938\nREVIEWS.\nHypnosis : its Meaning and Practice. By Eric Cuddon, M.A.,\nB.C.L. Bell. ;3s. 6d. net.\nThis book is one of the \" Psychical Experiences \" Series published\nby G. Bell & Sons, and its object, like that of the others in the series,\nis to make easily available to members of the public the contents of\npapers read at various times before our Society. One result of this\nis that a considerable part of the book consists of quotations from\npapers that have appeared in our Proceedings. There is, however,\nmuch evidence that the author has had a good deal of personal\nexperience of hypnotic practice, and that he has exercised indepen-\ndent judgment on the many problems that arise in the course of\nsuch experience.\nInvestigation of the problems of hypnotism was one of the first\ntasks set before our Society by its founders, and many of those\nwho have joined the Society in recent years may know httle of the\nwork done on this subject in former days by Edmund Gurney,\nFrederic Myers, Milne Bramwell, and other members. To them, as\nto the ordinary reading public, Mr Cuddon's book should be both\ninteresting and instructive. The extent to which he makes use of\nmaterial first published in our Proceedings gives some indication of\nthe important part played by our Society in the growth of our\nknowledge of Hypnotism. The selection and presentation of this\nmaterial has been done with much skill, and many of the recorded\nexperiments and the conclusions derived from them are illustrated\nand corroborated by Mr Cuddon's own researches.\nThere is little in the book that calls for adverse criticism, although\nthere are various matters on which differences of opinion may\nlegitimately be held. The definition of analgesia as \" a local loss of\nsensation without attending loss of consciousness \" is somewhat\nmisleading. This term is more accurately used in reference to loss\nof painful sensations only, for in hypnosis a locahsed pain may be\nabolished without loss of common sensation.\nOn most of the debateable questions Mr Cuddon's views are con-\nservative and his judgments cautious. But we know that a judg-\nment may be good while the reasons for it may be bad. He is little\ndisposed to believe in, or to accept any paranormal explanation of,\nsuch alleged phenomena as, for example, \" hypnotism at a distance \";\nand in referring to \" 100 experiments of this kind . . . made with\ncomplete success \", he says \"it is worthy of note, however, that\nthe subject was an hysterical girl of fourteen years of age \". What\n\fJune 1938 Reviews 239\nis implied by this statement is not clear. Whether or not the sub-\nject is an hysterical girl cannot affect the genuineness of phenomena\nthat have been accurately observed. The hypnotist will probably\nfind it just as difl&cult to hypnotise at a distance a girl who is\nhysterical as to hypnotise at a distance one who is not hysterical.\nIf, in either case, he succeeds, he has \" hypnotised at a distance \".\nThat doubt may be entertained of the genuineness or the value\nof phenomena exhibited by hysterical subjects is merely a \" popular\nbehef \" which has no more foundation than the popular behef in\nthe \" hypnotic power \" of the successful hypnotist. Mr Cuddon\ntells us that in his opinion there is no such thing as hypnotic power ;\nyet he thinks that in hypnotising a subject for the first time \" it is\nmost important that this opinion . . . should be withheld from the\nsubject and that his confidence be gained by convincing him that\nthe Hypnotist in fact possesses such a power in a marked degree \".\nSuch a pandering to popular belief savours of the methods of the\ncharlatan, and, although it may be permissible to the lay experi-\nmenter, the professional psychotherapist would do well to avoid\nany such device. T. W. M.\nEvidence of Purpose (\" Psychical Experiences \" Series). ZoB\nRichmond. Bell. 3s. 6d. net.\n\" Psychical Research without Tears is a descriptive phrase that\nsuggests itself as one lays down this httle volume on Evidence of\nPurpose, with Mrs Richmond's introduction and commentary. It\nis usually an arduous undertaking to read and digest any book on\npsychical research if it contains, as this book contains, really\nvaluable material. But it is evidence for the aptitude of the above\ndescription that, although read on a journey to a business meeting\nof a very worrying kind, the booklet held one's effortless attention\nthroughout the journey ; and this despite the fact that none of the\nmaterial was in itself new to the reader.\nIt is refreshing to read well-attested material without the trouble\nof having to follow through all the verifications, and these examples\nshould suggest to the general pubHc that the archives of the Society\nfor Psychical Research cannot make dull reading, if one has the\nopportunity of considting them which Membersliip gives.\nAfter a few years of work in psychical research, one tends to\nforget how bewildering at first are the technical terms that are used,\nno less than the ideas that they express. Memory brings back early\nconjectures about the meaning of words that seemed, to the un-\ntutored mind, suggestive of queer and scarcely reputable forms of\n\f240 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1938\nmental illness. Hence the value of tlie little glossary appended to\nthese volumes.\nThe memory of early difficulties in trying to read Proceedings,\nwithout guidance or plan, and of the small gain resulting therefrom,\nis still fresh ; and if each volume in this series does its work as simply\nand easily as this one by Mrs Richmond, the public has a remarkable\nopportunity of acquiring a working knowledge of the meaning and\naims of Psychical Research with the muiimum of effort and the\nmaximum of interest. It is not possible here to touch upon details\nof the cases that have been selected as showing purposive influences\nat work ;\none can only say that, as presented by Mrs Richmond,\nthey make as good reading as many a detective story, while the\nmethod of presentation allays the feeling that \" there must be a\ncatch in it somewhere \", which too often accompanies the reading of\nan ostensibly simple and straightforward book on this subject.\nAnd this is one of the effects which deserves special congratulation,\nbecause simple statement that properly conveys the meaning of\nevidence is one of the most difficult things to achieve in writing\nabout psychical research.

The paper will, it is hoped, be published later in Proceedings.\nCASE: A STUDY IN EVIDENCE\nIt may be of interest to examine, largely from the point of view of\nnormal interpretation, a case which appears to the sitter to have a\nclearly paranormal significance. The purpose of such an examination\nshould not be to invite a verdict against the sitter's views of the\nevidence, but to set out dispassionately such arguments as can be\nheld to support a more commonplace view.\nAny sitter relates the facts which are in evidence to a given con-\ntext : not merely a context of his personal beliefs or wishes, but a\ncontext of his actual circumstances and interests, which are real to\nhim as they cannot be real to the outside commentator. This can\naffect the interpretation of the evidence in two opposite ways. The\nsitter may perceive that the material presented at his sitting chimes\nin with his own facts and with his feelings about them, in a manner\nthat seems to have much more significance than he can convey by\nnoting that this point and that point correspond with one another.\nAnd this chiming-in of the evidence with an entire personal context\nis a psychological fact that cannot be set aside, whether it means that\nthe evidence is really apt to the context or that the personal interest,\nwith which the context is invested, has imported a significance that\ndoes not rightfully belong to the evidence.\nIn either case, the point to investigate is whether the manifest\nevidence can reasonably be thought to have arisen without any real\nreference (or without paranormal reference) to the sitter's interests.\nMr Irving's recent reports of his Leonard sittings have included a\ncase that well illustrates this important relation between evidence\nand the personal interests of the sitter, and in a properly scientific\nR 2\n\f244 Journal of Society for Psychical Eesearch July 1938\nspirit lie is quite ready to have the positive construction that can be\nplaced upon this evidence contrasted with the negative construction\nwhich\u2014as in all cases\u2014can also be put forward. The following\nextracts from Mr Irving's notes, with a commentary pointing to\nalternative lines of interpretation, are not designed to suggest a\nconclusion in either a positive or a negative sense. It may be left to\nMembers and Associates to form their own conclusions whether a\npositive or a negative verdict is appropriate, or whether the evidence\npresents a prima, facie case that cannot be conclusively weighed up\nby the outside critic. We have learned to recognise the value of\nproperly established negative conclusions in research ; but it may be\nimportant, in the limited state of our knowledge, not to attempt to\nherd the majority of cases into positive or negative groupings, if in a\nmajority of cases the Scottish verdict represents the more dis-\ncriminating view.\nMr Irving prefaces the case with the following note :\n\" For some months, I have been engaged in work among people\nfrom the Northern distressed areas, who are being brought into this\ndistrict in considerable numbers. Children from these families are\nattending my Sunday School, and a number have joined my choir.\nOne family, named Cole, had given up and decided to leave. The\nman had already gone, the wife and five children had arranged to\nfollow on the day of this sitting. I was distinctly distressed at this, as\nthe two oldest girls were the strongest singers in my choir, and the\noldest boy, Richard Cole, had become an Altar-server at his own\nrequest.\"\nApparent references to the name Cole are a central feature of the\nevidence to be described, and the context in which this name would\nhave special relevance for Mr Irving is indicated by the above para-\ngraph. It may also be noted that at three previous sittings Mr Irving\nhad noted allusions which seemed to refer to the new influx of\nchildren and to the demand which their presence had made upon\nMr Irving's interest and energies. Inquiry from Mr Irving (who,\nin turn, has made a careful inquiry from Mrs Leonard) makes it\nseem unlikely that he made any mention of this subject to Mrs\nLeonard at any time. There is, however, a weakness on strict eviden-\ntial grounds about all material that emerges at a sitting and could\nhave arisen from unrecorded and forgotten conversation with the\nmedium. The effect of any possible xmsafeguarded conversation is\nlimited, in the present case, to the general allusions to children which\nappear in the ensuing extracts.\n\fJuiY 1938 Case 245\nOne of these allusions is quoted, in Mr living's report, from a\nsitting of 3rd May, 1938, two days before the sitting at which allusions\nto the Cole children appear to be identified. The extract from the\nsitting of 3rd May is as follows :\nFeda :\n\" Why didn't they come when I was expecting them, little\nwhile ago, the Young Ones? Something she missed at home. She\nseems as if she just missed something, and she missed the lightness\n\u2014\nthe brightness\u2014the lightness ; it was just, rather like a blank. She\nthought you would have felt it, too. Not gone for good, Mr Bill, but\ntemporarily gone. '\nThey'll be coming again,' she says. '\nIt'll make,\nlike, happy interludes.' . . . She's looking forward to them again,\nMr Bill. Now, Mr Bill! She's brought that in specially, there,\nbecause she has a feeling that before you go back home, you will have\nseen something that reminds you of them. ...\"\nHere we have, first, an allusion to \" young ones \", which can be\nconnected with Mr Irving's interest in the influx of children from the\nNorth. A number of these, he notes, regularly come to his house\nhalf an hour or so before choir practice, but on one occasion went\ndirect to the church without calling for him.\nWith regard to the words \" before you go back home, you will\nhave seen something that reminds you of them \", Mr Irving comiects\nthis statement with the picture-test shortly to be described, and\nwrites as follows :\n\" The fact that I did not recognise it when I got the reminder of\nthem referred to here was due to my own stupidity. I failed, when\nexamining the Picture-test in the Daily Mail on Friday, 6th May,\nto connect '\nOld King Cole '\nwith the family of children named\n'\nCole '. It was not till I had been at home nearly a fortnight, and\nwas able to study the script of the sittings quietly, that I grasped how\n'\nDora '\nhad linked up the material.\"\nWe have to note, here, that the prediction that Mr Irving would\nsee \" something \" to remind him of the young ones \" before he\nwent home, could have many apparent fulfilments. The record\nhere contains no hint that the reminder is to be connected with a\npicture-test, and the chances of something fitting the allusion are not\nsmall.\nWe now turn to the picture-test which was given two days later,\nat Mr Irving's Leonard sitting of 5 May 1938. Mr Irving took the\nsitting alone, and as his custom is, posted a carbon copy of his notes\nto the S.P.R. rooms in the early afternoon of the same day. The\nrelevant part of the record begins as follows :\nFeda :\n\" Now- Dora would like to go on to a Picture right away.\"\n\f246 Jotinial of Society for Psychical Research July 1938\n(W. S. I. :\n\" Good.\") \" In the picture, the first thing she notices is\nthe presentation of a Church Dignitary. Do you know what that is?\nLike you. '\nNo,' she says, '\nnot like you. A Church Dignitary,\nbut ', Dora says, '\nnot like you\u2014not like you.' Oh! Why? 'Cos,\nshe says, she doesn't think you'd have much sympathy with this\nChurch Dignitary.' '\nYou'll know why when you see it\n\u2014you'll know\nwhy when you see it.'\n\"\nMr Irving notes :\n\" Nothing was said to the medium or controls\nabout picture-tests. On the back of the carbon copy, sent to Miss\nHorsell, I wrote that the picture should be found in the Daihj Mail\nfor Friday, 6 May 1938.\" (The range of choice, that is, extends over\nthe whole of the paper.) \" In that paper, I found a picture that\ncorresponds largely with the description. It is an advertisement of\nLyons' Swiss Rolls, and may, therefore, have appeared before,\nthough I have no recollection of having seen it before\u2014but I do not,\nas a rule, read advertisements. In this picture, which is approxim-\nately lOf in. by Q\\ in., one of the two figures shown is '\nOld King\nCole '.\nHe may be said to have been a '\nChurch Dignitary '.\n\"\nMr Irving supports this last annotation on the ground that he\nand his wife, as Anglo-Catholics, had decided views on Royal\nSupremacy over the Church. It struck me at once,\" he writes,\n\"as an interesting point of evidence of personal identity, that\nshe should joke about the King as a 'Church Dignitary'! \" If\na communicator's associations are like dream-associations, this idea\ncould be loosely combined with the more obvious conjecture that\nFeda is embroidering on a suggestion from Dora that \" King Cole\n\"\nshould be compared in some respect to Mr Irving, who is a clergy-\nman. Other points in the evidence, if we accept them, would be\ncoherent with the latter view.\nThe record proceeds :\nFeda :\n\" What is that, Dora? There's such a funny thing very\nprominent in the picture, too. I don't think Dora knows what it is,\nbut she knows what it looks like : a many-pointed star\u2014a many-\npointed star.\"\nMr Irving notes :\n\" Prominent in the picture is the crown on the head of King Cole.\nThis has some five points.\"\nFeda continues :\n\" In fact, there are several items\u2014several items\u2014several items.\nThat comes out of cookery books! She looks at you, and laughs, and\nsays, '\nThat comes out of cookery books. Don't you remember when\nshe had the cookery books\u2014Dora\u2014and she used to look into them.\n\f\f248 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1938\nto get something nice out of them, and she used to say, '\nDifferent\nitems '.\n. . . You wanted something doing rather specially some\ntime ago, and you thought of her. Was it about the time of the\nYoung Ones, too?\n\"\nMr Irving finds no special connection between a culinary require-\nment and the Northern children, but remarks on the fact that an\nallusion to them is brought in at this point, \" as though to show that\n'\nCole '\nis not an accidental reference.\" He does not connect\n\" items \" with the tarts that the Queen of Hearts is presenting in the\npicture.\nFeda continues :\n\" In this picture, there seem to be several items that would\nsuggest, I say '\nsuggest ', a planetary system. '\nSeveral items ', she\nsays, '\ndrawn in the picture,' do you see? That's right.\"\nMr Irving connects this with the clouds drawn around the lettering\nof the advertisement, and defends this view as natural to anyone\nunacquainted with astronomy ; but on this basis the word \" planet-\nary \" can be considered to have but little meaning. It seems\nequally likely that Feda is groping after another sense for \" items \",\nand has fallen back on an association to the word \" star \"\u2014by\nhypothesis an allusion to the pointed crown of King Cole.\nShe proceeds :\n\" Will you see if the word '\ngold ', or something meaning gold, is:\nshown very plainly in the picture, g-o-l-d, g-o-l-d? '\nYou see,' she\nsays, '\nI want to explain : it might be a heap of gold\u2014it might be a\nsum of gold '\n\u2014but she got the word '\ngold '.\"\nMr Irving suggests tentatively that this may be an allusion to the\nking's crown ; and on the hypothesis that a muddle has occurred in\nassociation with the word \" star \", the reference to \" gold \" might\nrepresent an attempt to strengthen the connection of the script\nwith the crown in the picture. But Mr Irving also points out that\nthe word \" gold \" occurs more than once in letterpress near the pic-\nture in the newspaper, and another commentator observes that quite\na different advertisement, on the same sheet of the paper, has the\nwords \" Gold Flake \" in large black letters, and a drawing in which\ntwo ellipses (for the rims of wheels) could be associated with \" planet-\nary system \". This last observation illustrates the ease with which\nat any rate one or two points can be found in some newspaper-\npicture to fit a given allusion. The similarity between \" gold \" and\n' Cole \" opens yet another path of conjecture.\nFeda continues :\n\" Now, wait a minute, Dora! Now there's a very strong idea come\n\fJuly 1938 Case 249\nto her from the picture. She felt, '\nSomething descending on me\n\u2014\nsomething descending on me\u2014something is coming on top of me.\nIt's too much for me.' I want to call out, '\nIt's too much for me.\nThis is too much.' I think that idea is portrayed clearly in the pic-\nture, '\nThis is too much. This is too much.' You put that down\ntwice, Mr Bill! '\nThis is too much.'\n\"\nMr Irving points out that the Queen of Hearts, in the picture, is\nstanding and offering a dish of tarts, from above, to the seated\nfigure of King Cole, who is waving them away, being already pos-\nsessed of a Swiss roll. Both descending on me \", and \" this is too\nmuch \", seem appropriate. If we are justified in taking the previous\nreferences to cookery, and to \" different items \", into this context,\nthere appears to be systematic allusion to the subject of the picture.\nMr Irving suggests also that the words \" this is too much \" may\nperhaps convey a secondary and personal allusion to his own fre-\nquent feeling about the invasions of his house by a number of active\nand hearty children :\n\" they strum on my piano, play bagatelle,\nand are rather sometimes rather overwhelming. I say to myself,\n'\nIt is too much for me.' '\nThis is too much.' But I love to have\nthem.\" While emphasising that this is a purely conjectural point,\nwe can allow that it is consistent with the hypothesis under con-\nsideration.\nAfter a brief reference to the verification of another test, which need\nnot concern us here, Feda continues :\n\" Now! Going back to what she's just given\u2014the new one\n\u2014\nshe doesn't think this is in it, but perhaps through it : teeth, teeth,\ndentistry and teeth.\"\nThis allusion does not add to the evidence in the case. \" Perhaps\nthrough it \" should mean, in the sense in which Feda elsewhere uses\nthe word \" through \" when giving picture-tests, something to be\nfound on the back of the test-picture. There is nothing relevant to\n\" teeth \". Mr Irving notes the possibility than an attempt to allude\nto the spikes of Bang Cole's crown may account for the reference to\n\" teeth \", and there is some ground for thinking that a communicator\nwould be dissatisfied with the previous attempts, supposing them to\nhave been made, to describe this crown ; but the conjecture is, as\nMr Irving says, \" thin \".\nFeda continues :\n\" Do you want a new kind of thing\u2014like a dressing-gown?\n\"\n(W. S. 1. :\n\" No.\") ' I feel you saying, '\nI must get a new one.'\n\"\n(W. S. I. :\n\" Pyjamas? \") \" Yes. Dora thought you'd have to.\nHave to get two. Dora says, '\nthey seem to be all gone or going.'\n\f250 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1938\nOh! Mr Bill! Do you remember special ones that you had long-\nago\u2014very special ones that you laughed about\u2014thought rather\nfantastic? I got something shaped in the front\u2014something that\namused you. I don't see the trousers, only the coat. '\nThe trousers\nisn't always visible,' she says. There's something she means in\nthat!\n\"\nMr Irving recalls no personal memory to which this would apply,\nbut points out that \" King Cole \" in the picture has a robe like a\ndressing-gown, and that no trousers are visible. The idea of a\npersonal reminiscence can be put down to a misconstruction on\nFeda's part of the actual idea presented to her ; but it is a serious\npoint against such interpretations that if a statement fits as a\npersonal reminiscence it can be treated as a positive point on that\naccount, while if it fits in with another, concurrent theme (in this\ncase, the ostensible subject of the picture-test), it seems a positive\npoint in that direction. This alternative application of allusions\ncannot be helped, since we have to take the Feda-mind as we find\nit, but the fact of there being an alternative application greatly\ndilutes the strength of the evidence.\nFeda next says that \" also through the picture\n\u2014\nthrough it, there's\nsomething about cats \". There is nothing better, for this, than a\nreference to mice on the other side of the page.\nWe finally have a point that raises the question of alternative\napplications in an acute form. Feda says :\n\" Mr Bill! I don't think this is you\u2014something to do with the\n'\nSearchers '.\" (Feda's usual term for those who work at the S.P.R.\nRooms.) \" Do you know, will you find out, please, if the Searchers\nbeen thinking about the passing\u2014the premature passing\u2014prema-\nture\u2014of a man in the prime of life\u2014in the prime of life\u2014premature\n\u2014sudden, you see? Wait a bit! His passing seems to have upset\nsome material matters. Apart from any grief there might be, it\nseems to have been worrying\u2014upsetting, Mr Bill. She gets this\nvery strongly, Mr Bill! She feels that this person would be someone\nwho mattered\u2014someone who mattered. Mr Bill! Not quite just\nan ordinary person, but, like, such surprise round it\u2014such surprise.\nNow, Mr Bill, will you be very careful how you put this down?\nI'm getting a name sounding with a '\nker '\nsound. Like the begin-\nning of coal. '\nKer '\n\u2014like that! Yes! ...\"\nMr Irving notes :\n\" Contrary to custom, there is nothing to show, in this sitting,\nwhereabouts the picture-test is supposed to end. I have not yet\nheard whether or not anyone has been identified by the S.P.R. as\n\fJuly ]938 Case 251\nhere referred to ;\n^ or whether the whole object of this is to bring\nthrough the word '\ncoal '\n\u2014which word was not given in the descrip-\ntion of the picture. I spelt the word '\ncoal ', rather than '\nCole ', as\nI had of course no idea at the time that references were being made\nto the Cole family, or to \"\nOld King Cole '.\"\nWe have here an emergence of the syllable k5l (to adopt a neutral\nspelling) which is quite striking in the context that has been built\nup around the Cole children and Old King Cole \". The question\nliow that context has been built up can be more fairly discussed\nafter some further evidence has been quoted, especially a passage in\nthis sitting which appears to allude to the Cole boy who at his own\nrequest became an Altar-server at Mr Irving's church.\nAnother problem is that of the justification for thinking that the\nsyllable kol \" was introduced with intention, rather than any other\nsyllable that would illustrate the ''\nker-sound This, however, is\nnot quite a fair way of putting the problem, since on the hypothesis\nof intention the \" ker-sound \" itself was introduced in the process\nof getting Feda to utter the syllable kol \". (That is, we have to\nconsider the probability of \" kol \" as against the probability of\nall other likely syllables, not merely as against the probability of\nother syllables beginning with a \" ker-sound But at best, the\nsyllable kol \" may have emerged by chance, or from another cause\nthan that required by the \" Cole \" hypothesis ; it is not accom-\npanied by the little explosion of excitement which Feda often (but\nnot always) exhibits on bringing an evidential point to expression :\nif\n' kol \" is intentionally \" slipped in\n\"'\nby the communicator, it is\nslipped in very quietly. Some emphasis is given to the passage\nabout the \" ker-sound \" (\" will you be very careful how you put\nthis down suggests the intended production of something more\nthan a single consonant) ; but the long preceding passage about an\napparently non-existent communicator is full of emphasis, repeated\nwords and phrases, and the usual signals by which Feda shows\nherself as thinking that she has got hold of something of value.\nIt is possible to suppose that Feda, here, feels the pressure of the\ncommunicator's intention without knowing its actual object, and\ntransmits this stress as an emphasis laid upon a meaningless message\nfor ' the Searchers \" : but this is only supposition, as against the\ndifficult fact that the hypothesis requires us to neglect a great deal of\nemphasis laid upon points that do not turn out to be correct, while\nwe select and accept a little-emphasised point, because it fits in\n^ No identification has been made, up to 5 July 1938,\n\f252 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1938\nwith a pre-established context. Further, nothing is brought to\nexpression, in the whole passage quoted above, to furnish any hint\nof an intended connexion with the picture-test or with the \" young\nones \". Any significance to be attributed to the syllable \" kol \", and\nits manner of emergence, has to be weighed up very carefully\nagainst this group of negative indications.\nIt remains to quote a number of allusions, later in the same\nsitting, which Mr Irving refers to the children from the North in\ngeneral or to the Cole children in particular. Feda says :\n\" Mr Bill! What steps are awkward there? You've said that\ntoo. Dora says, '\nthey are awkward '. She wants you to be careful\nwhen you use them. You might so easily tread wrongly.\"\nMr Irving notes :\n\" The new children are always begging to be allowed to climb the\nTower steps at my Churches. At Pauntley, the Tower is very old,\nand I understand the steps are worn and broken in places, though\nI have never climbed them. A number of the children\u2014including,\nI think, some of the Coles\u2014have been up the Tower.\"\nFeda continues :\n\" '\nKeep the door shut ' ? Mr Bill! What did you say\u2014you must\nhave the door shut? You must have that shut. It had been left\nopen, and should have been closed. Dora thinks it is closed now.\nDo you know, it had been left open before, and then you spoke\nabout it. Dora says, '\nI made you notice it. . .\n.'\n\"\nMr Irving notes :\n\" The door in question leads from the top of Oxenhall Church\nTower on to the battlements. Owing to this door having been left\nopen, damage had been done. I have several times, lately, told our\nVerger that this door must be kept shut. I have, also, forbidden the\nchildren, when they climb Oxenhall Church Tower, to go through\nthis door.\"\nFeda says :\n\" Is there such a nice boy there? I feel ' boy ', not ' girl Such a\nnice boy. Dora's making me feel him strongly. A boy that's so\nunderstanding, and as if he'd got such nice manners, and such sym-\npathy, for a boy. And yet light-hearted, not miserable ; a boy with\na very fine nature. Dora has brought him and you close together.\"\n(\" Here \", Mr Irving notes, \" came a few words I could not catch\nexactly, but they sounded like the following :\n'\nShe uses such a\nfunny word here '.\") \"It seems as if he'd like to serve you\u2014it seems\nas if he'd like to serve you. Let him. It will help him.\" (W. S. I. :\n\" He's going.\") \" He may be. It's not certain\u2014not quite certain,\n\fJuly 1938 Case 253\nbut whether he does or not make the best of him now. If he goes,\nhe'll come back. When he goes, you may not think he's coming\nback. He'll come back, and there may be some delay about his\ngoing. He's not gone.\n\" '\nR '\n\u2014what's '\nR '\nto do with him? He is nice. He's got a pure\nspirit\u2014a very pure spirit, and yet he's normal, and jolly, and happy.\nHe's free, too, a free soul. . . . Well! We're sorry if that boy does go,\nbut it's only for a time.\" (W. S. I. : You're not speaking of a boy\nthat's gone? \" [Meaning a boy named Maule.]) \" No\u2014no! A boy\nstill there.\"\nMr Irving notes :\n\" This boy is Richard Cole ; the evidence for this is clear and\ndefinite. The description of the boy's character is excellent\n;\nthough, if that were the only point, it would fit another boy even\nbetter. This other boy, Maule, left the parish early in March. He,\ntoo, was an Altar-server. After he had gone. Cole came to me and\nsaid that he would like to be a Server ; that he had told his father\nthis, and his father told him to ask me. I was very pleased, as boys\nare shy, and seldom offer to help in this way. He had only been\nserving a few weeks, however, before the Coles definitely decided to\nleave at once. They were to have gone on the day of this sitting.\nWTien I got home on 7 May, however, I found them still here\u2014but\nthey left on 10 May. I think it certain that they will not come back.^\nThere may be confusion here with Maule\u2014as there is a possibility\nof the Maules returning. '\nR '\nis the initial of the boy Richard\nCole.\"\nSix names were mentioned or attempted by Feda after this, with\nthe remark, \" Dora's very interested in these boys\u2014she's very\ninterested in them, as if she's getting them together, and helping\nthem.\" \" Getting them together \" can be read as showing intention\nto gToup these names in a particular context, if it is supposed that\nFeda takes the idea literally, and adds the words \" and helping\nthem \" on her own account.\n\" Tony or Toby\u2014I think Tony,\" recalled to Mr Irving, as he\nreports, \" the only Tony I have had, who left several years ago. He\nwas a local boy, and also a Server at Pauntley Church.\"\nFeda asks if there is somebody there called \" Peter\u2014Peter?\n\"\n^ A letter from Richard Cole, received bj' !Mr. Irviiig on 5 July, 193S, some\nweeks later than the above annotation, says that Richard and his father may\n\" come do-wTi while the fruit is out \". This could foreshadow a literal fulfil-\nment of the prediction of the \" servmg \" boy's return, though the return\nwould, apparently, be for a short time only.\n\f254 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1938\nMr Irving notes, \" I know of no boy from the North named '\nPeter '.\nThere is a young man who lives close to me, Peter S. He used to\nhelp as a Server at church, but has dropped off coming.\"\nThe common name John is given by Feda as that of \" another\nboy \". Mr Irving notes that \" There are four '\nJohns '\nin Oxenhall\nChurch Choir. One of these is a boy from the Distressed Areas.\"\nFeda says, \" And is there one called Barry? Berry or Barry\"?\n\"\nMr Irving notes :\n\" No\u2014but I have arranged to take my Choir,\nwhich includes now a lot of these children, to Barry Island, on\n4th August, for half a day at the sea.\"\nA fifth name was purposely supplied by Mr Irving when Feda\nappeared to be groping for it : Feda described an unsatisfactory\nboy, whom Mr Irving identifies as a singularly difficult case, possibly\nnot normal, from the Distressed Areas. At Mr Irving's wish, details\nare not printed here.\nThe sixth name was \" Dennis \", which Mr Irving can identify only\nwith a choir-boy at Pauntley who left the district some months before\nthe sitting\u2014not one of the boys from the North.\nThis group of names that can be connected with Mr Irving's\nChurch Choir, with the boys from the North, and in two instances\nwith the position of Altar-server in church\u2014a position held by the\nboy Cole, whose wish to \" serve \" appears to be alluded to on p. 252\n\u2014constitutes evidence for which chance seems the only normal ex-\nplanation. Assuming on strictly critical grounds that Mr Irving\ncould have spoken to Mrs Leonard of his interest in the children from\nthe North, and forgotten that he had done so, the likelihood of his\nimparting this group of names and details is negligible. But it can\nbe argued that the five names actually given by Feda are not\nuncommon ;\none, \" Barry \", is referred only to an association of a\nplace with the boys in question : and there are a considerable\nnumber of boys among whom to find relevance for the names. The\npoint on which a good deal of help from chance-coincidence seems to\nbe required is the persistence of apparent allusions to the \" Server\n\"\ntheme.\nThis is the last point in a succession of \" Cole \" allusions which\nMr Irving traces as running through the material. We can say that\nthey all, in greater or less degree, apply to the context of Mr Irving's\ninterest in the Northern children, and, in particular, to his interest in\nthe Coles and regret at their departure. By a condensation and dis-\nplacement of ideas a little like that of dreams, the Old King Cole of\nthe picture can be jokingly applied, in a communication, to Mr\nIrving in his jovial and hospitable relationship to \" the young\n\fJuly 1938 Case 255\nones \". And so with other points : one after another will fit the\ncontext.\nOr, we can say that this context exists and is organised in Mr\nIrving's mind, and is applied to a given mass of material : that it is\nnot given points in the material that of their own accord apply to the\ncontext, but the context itself which governs the selection of chance\npoints (with due assistance from chance-coincidence) ; these points\nhaving no interior organisation of their own. The apparent organisa-\ntion and intention behind Feda's allusions, on this hypothesis, are\ndue only to their having been placed in the framework of an organised\ncontext supplied from outside\u2014from the system of fact and interest\nalready present in Mr Irving's mind. (In this respect, the present\ntype of case differs radically from, for example, the S.P.R. cross-\ncorrespondence cases, in which the framework to which the given\npoints of evidence are to be applied remains a mystery, until, after\ndue labour, the pieces of the puzzle appear to fall together of their\nown accord.)\nOn a hypothesis of normal mental action\u2014conscious and uncon-\nscious\u2014each single one of the points of evidence in the present case\ncan, with a little difficulty here and there, be attributed to chance,\nand to the manner in which the mind does automatically select\nchance items that fit into a particular framework of interest. The\n\" Young Ones \" could cover a wider field of age than childhood,\nif we are regarding Feda's phrases as fishing-nets. The \" something\n\"\nthat Mr Irving will notice could be something other than a news-\npaper-picture. The picture itself could have happened to be in the\nmedium's mind, being a well-known advertisement : or the corre-\nspondences between the picture and the disarticulated details of the\ndescription may be held to be merely fortuitous. (It will be noted,\nhowever, that we cannot have both these explanations.) Feda's\nreference to the death of someone known to \" the Searchers \",\nwhether it has any basis in fact or not, may have been manipulated\nso as to get the syllable \" kol\" pronounced ; but the idea of a\nname beginning with a \" ker-sound \" could be a chance guess, and,\ngiven this, \" coal \" is a word that anyone might use, in telephoning,\nto indicate a hard \" c \".\nIn the further apparent allusions to the children from the North,\n\" steps \" that are \" awkward \" convey an idea that might chance\non several applications other than the steps of the church tower,\nand Feda's suggestion of care on Mr Irving's part is off that mark\n\u2014he says he has not used the tower steps. \" You must have the\ndoor shut \" could also have various chance apphcations. But we\n\f256 Jaurnal of Society Jar Psychical Research July 1938\nmust note the coincidence (chance or other) that these two allusions\ncan both be applied to the association of the children with the towers of\nMr Irving's two churches. Again, the emphasis on a boy's desire\nto serve jMr Irving may connect by simple chance with the position\nof young Cole as Altar-server, at his own wish, and the relevant\ndescription of the boy (Mr Irving finds it even more applicable to\na predecessor of this boy as Altar-server) could be a lucky hit ; a\ndistinctly fortunate chance-coincidence, however, must be brought\nin if we are to give a normal explanation to the emergence of two\nnames which are those of past Atlar-servers of Mr Irving's, among\nfive names that all show greater or less relevance to boys in connexion\nwith Mr Irving's church services. This is a point at which a hypo-\nthesis of successive chances may cease to satisfy the mind, unless\nnormal explanation is to be fortified by the off-chance that Mr\nIrving may have suffered from a quite extraordinary attack of\ncommunicativeness about his parish affairs, and a subsequent loss\nof memory on the subject.\nWithout such abnormally normal conjecturing, however, we can\nnote at least that each single one of the elements in Mr Irving's\ncase can be explained as chance ; and we can try to estimate\nthese chances\u2014a necessary procedure in all judgment of evidence. It\nremains, after that, to weigh up the probability of so many apparently\nevidential points, however varying in value, being available, by\nchance, for selection ; and also to estimate such apparent indications\nof constructive intention as are contained in the sequence of events\nat the sitting, and in the observed course of the stream of words\nby which the apparently evidential points emerge.\nThis, it cannot be too clearly stated, means an evaluation which\ncannot be accurate and complete. There are too many factors, and\ntoo many of them are imknown factors. An opinion only can be\nformed in such cases, and, with practice, an increasingly reasoned\nopinion. (Or else, it must be remarked, an increasingly rationalised\nopinion.) No evaluation at all is being put forward in the present\ncase. Such partial evaluation, or such opinion, as is possible, is left\nfox the reader to consider. The present commentary will have\nserved its purpose if it is condemned both for its severity and for its\nlenience.\nK. R. .\n\fJuly 1938 Correspondence 257\nCORRESPONDENCE\nExperiment in Extra-Sensory Perception\nTo the Editor of The Journal\nSir,\u2014Your Research Officer, Mr Herbert, has ruled that the com-\nmercial ESP cards are \" totally unsuitable for serious experimental\nwork \". Mr Herbert evidently has in mind letting the subject handle\nand look at the cards.\nFor his information I will state that the ESP tests are not made in\nthat way, except by amateurs or for mere exploratory purposes in\nsearch of subjects. In earlier years when the subjects were allowed\nto look at the card-backs, the cards were cut from heavy opaque\nstock and carefully inspected. But even so, no conclusions of ESP\nwere published without the security of covering series of tests in\nwhich the subjects had no sensory contact with the backs of the\ncards.\nWhere we disagree, I fear, with Mr Herbert is that we have come\nto thinli: that no card can he counted perfect after handling (and of\ncourse they must be handled in shuffling). Accordingly, even if\nMr Herbert obtains for his own research a more perfect pack of cards,\nwe should still have to take with them precisely the same precautions\nwe now employ with the present stock. And he will doubtless wish\nto be no less careful himself. There will be simply the matter of the\nadded cost of the \" perfect \" cards.\nThe ESP cards are very inexpensive, are convenient to handle,\nwork well in shuffling machines, and are commercially distributed.\nThis is all that need concern us. They are quite as easily screened as\nany other cards. There are a half-dozen methods of using them\nsafely (i.e., with no sensory contact) now in use in more than a\nscore of American and Canadian collegiate laboratories. A half-\ndozen other techniques have been recently launched or are in\nprospect.\nBut Mr Herbert fears that the experimenter may unconsciously\ndetect the symbol and then unconsciously signal or telepathically\ntransfer it to the subject. With the cards sealed up in opaque\nenvelopes or kept untouched until the end of the run, or with them\nscreened from the experimenter's vision, all this is definitely out.\nOr with sufficient distance between subject and experimenter, any\nsuch signalling would be ruled out. In precognition tests the\nexperimenter too does not know the order of the cards.\n\f258 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July H)38\nBut if one is to suspect the experimenters themselves of uncon-\nscious perception, unconscious signalling, with of course unconscious\ndishonesty, would it not be simpler to suppose the simple uncon-\nscious fabrication of the whole experiment and to dismiss it from all\nserious consideration?\nJ. B. Rhine.\nDuke University, 24 June 1938.\n(Professor Rhine surely cannot be indifferent to the use by\namateurs or for exploratory purposes of cards which are definitely\nlikely to give misleading results : especially when these cards are\nbeing sold in large quantities for amateur experiment, with its\nanticipated effect upon amateur opinion.\n\u2014\nEd.)\nSir,\u2014The studied behaviour of Mr S. G. Soal towards Mrs Eileen\nGarrett described in his paper in Part 154 of Proceedings may have\nhad a different effect from what was intended. Instead of, or as well\nas, calming the subject it may have misled her.\nThus, Mr Soal or his assistants told Mrs Garrett her exact score\nwhen it was 8 or 9, apparently without comment, and then told her\nshe was \" splendid \" when she scored 6 or 7. Now, after her experi-\nences at Duke University, Mrs Garrett would regard these scores of\n8 or 9 as nothing unusual and would therefore expect \" splendid\n\"\nto mean more than 8 or 9 and not less.\nIt seems possible therefore that this form of words may have misled\nthe subject and encouraged in her that state of mind which tended\ntowards the production of \" chance \"'\nscores and discouraged her\nfrom repeating whatever mental activity it was that brought about\nthe results recorded in America.\nYours faithfully,\nJ. T. Evans.\nNOTE ON PROFESSOR RHINE'S LETTER\nIn considering the suitability for serious research of the commercial\nZener cards which were submitted to me, I was not concerned with\nexperiments in which the subject was allowed to handle the cards,\nsince I did not think it even rei^iotely probable that any serious\nexperimenter would permit such a procedure. I had in mind :\n(1) experiments in which the subject saw the back of each card as it\nwas presented for guessing ; (2) experiments in which the subject\n\fJuly 1938 Note on Professor Rhine's Letter 259\nsaw the edges of the pack ; (3) experiments in which the subject did\nnot see the cards at all, but where the experimenter saw the backs\nor the edges.\nFor experiments of the first class the cards are unsuitable because\nthe symbols themselves can be seen from the backs. For experi-\nments of the second class the cards are unsuitable because certain\ncards can be identified from their edges, and, if the subject had ever\nseen the face or back of such a card, leakage might occur. For\nexperiments of the third class the cards are imsuitable because the\nexperimenter might unconsciously gain information as to the\nidentity of certain cards and transmit this information to the\nsubject either by sensory cues, unconsciously given, or by telepathy,\nif a telepathic faculty exists.\nThe unsuitability of the cards is removed in the following con-\nditions : (a) A long distance separates cards and experimenter, so\nthat sensory cues cannot operate. (6) The subject has never seen\nthe cards, (c) The faculty under investigation is paranormal per-\nception in general, not paranormal perception exclusive of telepathy.\nBut even if these conditions obtain, any accidental departure\nfrom condition (6) would have much more serious implications than\nif cards of a reasonable standard of efficiency had been used. As\nerrors are liable to occur in even the best regulated experiments, it is\nsurely advisable to guard against their being of consequence by\ntaking every reasonable precaution.\nNo cards can ever be perfect even when new, since no two can be\nexactly similar ; but I do not think that the impossibility of attain-\ning perfection can absolve the serious worker from using cards of a\nreasonable standard. The commercial cards submitted to me did\nnot, in my opinion, attain this standard.\nFor experiments in which opaqiie envelopes are used, the cards\ncan no longer be considered as cards but merely as so many Zener\nfigures\u2014pieces of paper with the symbols written on them would\nbe as suitable. The requirements for the cards would then devolve\nupon the envelopes.\nIn experiments in this difficult field, where the very existence of\nthe faculties under investigation is open to doubt, it is surely ad-\nvisable to take every reasonable precaution against flaws in the\nprocedure. The deliberate use of defective cards seems to me to\ninvite adverse criticism, and greatly to lessen the weight which could\notherwise be attached to any results claimed.\nC. V. C.

The following\nrecord was piit into our hands by Baron Palmstierna on September\n30, 1938, and will be of interest to our readers for its apparent\nreference to a decision, and to the state of mind accompanying that\ndecision, which are vouched for as not having been known at the\ntime to the percipient or those with whom she was in touch. While\nwe cannot say that the Premier's flight to Berchtesgaden is quite\ncertainly the subject of allusion, the agitated message at the end of this\nrecord indicates that some very unusual step for peace was being\ntaken that day, as was in fact the case.\nThe scripts quoted below were all received by Mrs Adila Fachiri,\nin the presence of Baron Palmstierna, who states that no information\nwas available to them on the relevant points, beyond that which\nhad been given in the Press and in broadcast announcements.\nBaron Palmstierna also vouches for the fact that the time of the\nfinal script was correctly recorded by himself, when the script was\ngiven.\nBaron Palmstierna's communication to the Society runs as follows:\nThe European Crisis\nThe following unsought-for messages referring to the European\ncrisis and arriving through Mrs Fachiri in the manner mentioned\nin \" Horizons of Immortality \", are of general interest\n:\n\" Do not worry about the present state of affairs. It is the begin-\nning of an upheaval which ultimately will unite mankind and cause\nthe knowledge of spiritual life to gain ground. (10.4.38).\"\n\" There is a tremendous fight going on between right and wrong\n\fOctober 1938 Case 263\nand it cannot take place without causing uneasy and unsettled\nfeelings in those who are sensitive. It is astonishing to watch how\nquickly conditions change on earth. The fickleness of man has\nreached a peak. Now, this turmoil, this conflict, is mainly due to\nthe fact that some leaders are endeavouring to prove that their\nperishable means are the one power on earth and that God is an\nillusion. This extraordinary attitude is evil's weapon and it has\nbeen fermented in the minds of degenerate leaders. It will eventually\ncause their defeat.\"\nContemporary note : It was feared that Germany would take\nadvantage of the situation and march into Czechoslovakia on\ndemands from the Sudeten Germans. A risk of war was in the air.\n\" The world needs an elemental shock and then perhaps it will\nawaken to the life of the spirit. (28.4.38).\"\n\" We shall soon give you more information regarding the situation\non earth. The waves on earth are very much going in cross currents\nto the waves from a strong place in space. You are under the\ninfluence of these crossing waves but that does not mean that evil\nhas gained. No, as far as we can judge, it almost causes a weakening\nof evil's power which, though creating uneasiness in many minds,\nalso causes strong desires for unity among men. (13.6.38).\"\n\" We told you previously that earth is progressing but not being\nheaven it is bound to undergo trials and just now the trials of\nconfusion have reached a summit. Emphasize the importance of\npositive attitudes with all those who are urged to proclaim ideas\nconveying to possible reforms. If they loose their flesh through\nsuch activities it does not matter. Their influence will be left\nbehind and continue the work. (16.8.38).\"\nContemporary note : The rapidly developing crisis over Czecho-\nslovakia and the threat of another world war caused widespread\nanxiety.\n\" The force, e.g. the remaining force, of evil is hard at work but,\nas we see it, the situation will be cleared up. Remember that we judge\nfrom the main pictures we see but what goes on inside those em-\nbracing pictures are incidents created by man which nevertheless\nmatter for the souls on earth who depend on them.\nWe advise all to maintain a cheerful attitude and not to fall for\ndepressions. We cannot repeat it often enough that such a state of\nmind is important. A wise measure would also be to concentrate\nthoughts on the man who is not clear himself about the actual\nsituation. Even a joint petition to him, if delivered straight, could\nproduce miracles.\nBut it is always fear or fear of self ridicule which prevents actions\nS2\n\f264 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1938\nof that kind. Christ would not, however, have minded to become\nridiculed when doing a good act. (14.9.38).\"\nContemporary note : This to us incomprehensible message received\nits explanation after the historic events. It seems to portray the\nminds of those concerned. It is now common knowledge that Herr\nHitler was not fully aware of the situation and its implications ; and\nthe words of the British Prime Minister in the House of Commons\non September 28 bore out that he had conquered the fear of self-\nhimiiliation and ridicule in case of a failure. He said : \"I know very\nwell that in taking such an unprecedented course I was laying\nmyself open to criticism on the ground that I was detracting from the\ndignity of a British Prime Minister. . . . Considerations of that kind\ncould not be allowed to count.\"\nAt the end of the same day's sitting, 1.1.5 ^;.w., a rapidly and\nexcitedly dehvered message arrived announcing better news :\n\" We are just told that you will hear some news about the situation\nwhich might clear away some fear but we are also told that every\nsecond\u2014speaking in earthly words\u2014moves on fickle waves. We are\ntrying our best to interfere and to disperse the unsteadiness.\"\nNote : The decision to fly to Berchtesgaden must evidently have\nbeen taken at the indicated moment. The Prime Minister flew on\nhis first visit to Germ.any on the next day, the 15th of September.\nThe news of his intention to go was announced in special editions of\nthe evening papers at about 10 p.m. on the 14th in London. Sub-\nsequent events bear out that the meeting of the two statesmen and\nthe direct appeal bore the intended results in the end. Naturally\nnone of those who were given these messages, being at the time in\nScotland, and far from news, could have preconceived or heard of\nthe momentous step taken by the British Prime Minister.\nLondon, Sepemher 30th 1938. Erik Palmstierna.\nCASE : AN INSTANCE OF MENTAL AUTOMATISM\nAND APPARENT TELEPATHY\nThis Case is presented by Mr J. C. Maby, as a study of automatic\nmental action with only slight indications of a paranormal back-\nground. It is not without value, when we are considering the prob-\nlem of paranormal perception in general, that we should know\nsomething about the play of construction that commonly goes on\nin the percipient mind, and this analysis of an experience may\npromote discussion of the psychological mechanisms that are\ninvolved. We welcome Mr Maby's plea for fuller consideration of\nspontaneous cases, and we are, as always, anxious to give attention\n\fOctober 1938 Case 265\nto any careful record and authentication of phenomena. The initial\neffort, however, can only come from those who take the trouble to\nmake careful records, and to have them attested, at the first possible\nmoment. It is these who make the mam contribution to progress\nin psychical research.\nMr Maby reports and coroments upon his experience below.\nThe following comparatively simple experience, the apparent\nnature of which is indicated by the above title, may be found to be\ngenerally instructive in connection with parapsychological studies.\nBy way of introduction I should explain that, although I have\noccasionally acted in the past as an unconscious automatist at little\ntable-tipping seances, at which it was shown by suitable tests that\nit was I, apparently, who was producing the \" messages \" ; and\nalthough I have also once or twice written down short \" commimi-\ncations \" that I have heard in a faintly clairaudient manner quite\nunexpectedly and spontaneously ; I have never encouraged or\nregularly practised the faculty, which I have simply treated as a\nconvenient subject for analysis. I have, nevertheless, as long as\nI can remember, been notably subject to telepathic, and occasional\nclairvoyant or even, more rarely, apparently precognitive, percep-\ntions ; and such perceptions have not infrequently taken on a perfectly\nobjective hallucinatory form\u2014sometimes easily distinguishable as\nsuch, at others entirely indistinguishable (except by means of\na subsequent examination of their context and the negative testi-\nmony of other persons present at the same time) from normal\nsensory perceptions, whether of sight, sound or touch. And it was,\nin fact, the insistence, subjective reahsm and frequent veridicahty\nof such experiences that early stirred my personal interest in\nPsychical Research. The present incident has, therefore, been\nselected from a considerable collection of often more dramatic and\nremarkable experiences of an aUied nature, and selected for purely\nillustrative and analytical reasons, rather than because of any\ndramatic quaUty which it certainly does not possess.\nThe experience occurred on May 16th of this year ; it was recorded\nin pencil at the time, and shown to my wife and a neighbour (who\nhave attested the fact) the next morning ; and my brother, who may\nbe fairly described as agent in the matter, was sent the account and a\nbrief questionnaire two days later. These notes and correspondence\nmay be seen by anyone interested ;\n^ but I have endeavoured to\ngive the gist of the affair in the following account without distortion\nor serious omissions.\n1 They are on record at the S.P.R. Rooms.\n\f266 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1938\nConditions. I had retired to bed alone, after some late laboratory\nwork, at about 12.30 a.m. (summer time), with the idea of reading\nfor a short while ;\nbut I decided, instead, to try my hand at a little\n\" automatic \" writing, by which I mean conscious writing down of\nseemingly inspirational ideas of communications ; to do which I had\nfelt an urge growing upon me for some time that evening, as well\nas upon other past occasions, when I had taken no action in the\nmatter, owing to other preoccupations. On the evening in question,\nhowever, the sensation was a relatively urgent one. But I had no\npreconceptions as to the possible nature or form of the forthcoming\n\" message \".\nI sat up in bed, with pencil and a sheet of paper, feeling wide\nawake, though prepared to sleep, and made my mind as blank\nand receptive as possible ; the night being still and no immediate\ndisturbances to worry one. Certainly I was not comatose.\nAfter a few disjointed thoughts and visual images that I judged\nto be of personal and obvious origin, I was momentarily startled to\nhear quite distinctly and in life-like tones what was undoubtedly\nmy wife's voice speaking to me. But it was an \" inner \" a,nd \" still,\nsmall \" voice\u2014not externalised in the room around me, nor outside\nthe room. In fact, the communication was of the \" telephone con-\nversation \" variety. My wife, be it noted, had gone to bed on the\nfloor below me, feeling tired early, at about 10.30 p.m., and she was\n(she said) certainly fast asleep long before the time in question,\nbeing a fairly heavy and easy sleeper. It should be noted, however,\nthat on a number of occasions, while sleeping together, I have, both\naccidentally and purposefully, acted as telepathic agent and she as\npercipient, when she has scarcely fallen asleep or has been restless ;\nso that there may be said to be a good psychical rapport between\nus\u2014a fact clearly evidenced by commonplace thought transferences\nbetween us in the daytime also. But such examples need not be\nfurther mentioned here, except perhaps to remark that the same\nthing applies to our small boy, R., and (though less strongly and\nfrequently) to other more or less intimate friends, relatives and\nmembers of the household ; that frequency evidently decreasing in\nproportion to the decrease of inter-personal affection and sym-\npathetic understanding, as distinct from any question of mere com-\nmonality of daily experience. Or thus it would appear.\nMy wife's voice was almost immediately followed by a second,\nmale, voice, speaking in a very different and an authoritative tone,\nand commencing with the entirely unexpected exhortation :\n\" Write\nwhat I tell you! \" To which I, meekly and with interested expecta-\ntion, acquiesced. I had been waiting for my wife's voice to con-\n\fOctober 1938 Case 267\ntinue, and the sudden transition gave me a definite shock. At the\nsame time I strongly sensed that it was my brother, then in Oxford,\naddressing me, or at least that he was directly associated with the\nphenomenon. Yet the voice was, if anything, more like my own\nvoice, as if reading aloud from a book or else making some formal\nproclamation. It was again an \" inner \" voice of the \" telephone\n\"\nvariety, not objectively externalised in a spatial way, nor seeming\nto enter through one or other ear ;\nand yet it was subjectively\nexternalised, if one may use such a phrase.\nThis new voice was, as I said above, imperative in tone : it was\nalso quiet, unfaltering and extremely deliberate, as if purposely\ndictating to me. Once or twice it seemed to fade into the distance,\nas if some kind of screen of my own conscious thoughts had inter-\nvened ;\nthen I had to wait and listen carefully for the next few\nwords. There was also a sense of slight uncertainty about some,\nbut not all, of the proper names ; but I did my utmost not to allow\nany auto-suggested words to creep in. Once or twice, however,\nI had a strong suspicion that I was tending to anticipate in my\nown mind ;\nthough the voice seemed to continue without attention\nto such thoughts of mine, so that the whole \" communication \" gave\nme a sense of extraneous inspiration\u2014whether rightly or wrongly\nthe reader must try to judge for himself. Moreover, the \" com-\nmunication \" ended as unexpectedly as it had begun, and that with\na definite air of finality and completion. Nor did anything further\ntranspire, though I waited receptively for some minutes.\nThe two \" communications \" are given below, verbatim.\nIt remains to be said that I have not studied the Classics since\nI was fourteen years of age, nor looked at or in any way consciously\nreflected upon classical literatm'e of any sort, I believe, for several\nyears ; but have been actively engaged upon my own scientific work\nin the laboratory, interspersed by occasional literary efi;orts, mainly\nof a biological, physiological or psychological kind ; such matters\nbeing very far removed from the present \" communication \" both\nas to content and style. I had, moreover, been engaged in experi-\nmental work until late that very evening ;\nneither had I given (I am\nashamed to say) intentional thought or conversation to my brother\nfor several weeks previously, though I was aware that he was in\nOxford. We had not lately written to one another. I had, however,\nlate one night, again while lying in bed, a few days earlier, quite\nsuddenly had a distinct sensation that my brother was in my room\nin 2JeTson walking towards me. But the impression was evanescent,\nand I had almost immediately dismissed it from mind without noting\nthe date or making any enquiry\u2014especially as he regards such\n\f268 Journal of Society for Psychical Besearch October 1938\nexperiences with a mixture of aversion and contemptuous amuse-\nment.\nThe \" Commmiications\n\"\nA male voice (sounding like my own). ...\" What do I hear?\n\"\nA female voice (clearly my wife's). ...\" Cecil, it is Adelaide\nspeaking. Hullo darling!\n\"\nI answered \" Hullo! I hear you \", or some such words, not\nrecorded, and waited for more. There was then a pause of a minute\nor more.\nA male voice (my own or my brother's?). ...\" Write what I tell\nyou.\"\nI answered that I was listening, and prepared to write as desired.\nThe Voice (calmly, slowly and with precise determination, in the\nsame rather monotonous, but imperative, tone).\n\" There was a time in Sidonia, before the Komans sacked\nCarthage, when corn was cheap and plentiful, and no man paid\nmore than two denarii a bucket for it. At such a time came\nCassius with a fleet of galleys numbering over 2000, rowed by\nslaves from Gaul. And one Parvinus, an overseer in the house-\nhold of Armenius (a brave man, but an enemy of Caesar) gave\nwarning to the citizens ; it being the tenth day of March\naccording to the Julian calendar.\nThe moon being full, Cassius commanded that the ships be\nrun upon the strand that bordered the sea-shore at that place,\nthinking to storm the enemy's encampment by stealth at night.\nBut the night being clear, and no wind stirring, then did Par-\nvinus perceive the invaders from his station upon the roof of\nArmenius' house ; and going into the city sounded an alarm.\nSo that Cassius and all his men were driven back upon the sea-\nshore, and many killed by the Sidonians in a great massacre\nbefore they were re-embarked and clear away beyond the spears\nand arrows of the victors. ... So were the invaders driven from\nSidon, and the city saved by the watchfulness of Parvinus and\nthe valor of his compatriots.\" [Punctuation inferred by ear.]\nStatement by the Supposed Agent\nIn response to my questionnaire, which he answered, and in a\ncovering letter, my brother (A. C. Maby) confirmed that he was\nliving and working in Oxford at the time, had not seen me since\nEaster, and that we did not then discuss any classical literature or\nhistory. He said that he had not particularly been thinking of us\non that day, but that he had done so on other occasions recently ;\n\fOctober 1938 Case 269\nthat he had not lately been studying classical or relevant Hterature\nfrom which such a passage as that cited above might have been\nsomehow derived.\nBut in his covering letter my brother wrote as follows :\n\" I do not think for a moment that the message came from me,\nthough the following additional points may be of interest.\n1. I was awake at the time (of the '\ncommunication') on Sunday,\nMay 16th to 17th. I could not go to sleep either that or the following\nnight, which is most unusual for me.\n2. I have done absolutely no reading of Latin or Greek for two\nyears. Recently, however, I have seen Purcell's opera Dido and\nAeneas : scene\u2014Carthage. I have also had discussions as to the\nconnection between Carthage, Phoenicia and Wales, apropos of\nmusical modes. But not for a couple of months.\n3. I am glad that I did not give you a message so full of an-\nachronisms!\n\"\nHe then went on to point out that Carthage was sacked by Rome\nin 146 B.C., long before the birth of Caesar or the use of the Julian\ncalendar ; that Armenius and Parvinus are not Sidonian names,\nthough they might be those of Romanised Sidonians. And he\nsuggested that two denarii was \" a lot for a bucket of corn \".\nAnalytical Remarks\nAs this incident has been given simply as an interesting example\nof a form of clairaudience and semi-automatism, seemingly based\non telepathic factors, the significance and psychological value of\nwhich members of the Society may best assess for themselves,\nit is not proposed to enter into any very lengthy discussion. I am\npersonally satisfied, however (see also subsequent incident below),\nthat the strong sense of my brother's presence, combined with the\nfact that the names Carthage and Phoenicia {e.g. Sidon) had admit-\ntedly been prominent in his thoughts some short while before the\n\" communication \" occurred\u2014whereas I can think of no other prob-\nable source\u2014and the fact that he was unusually wakeful and restless\nthat particular night points to A. C. M. as a probable telepathic\nagent. That such ideas were not consciously uppermost in his mind\non that particular night is, I think, no major detraction, as he may\nwell have had them in mind in a dreamy or subliminal way :\n^ more\nlikely that, than that I should have absorbed them several weeks\n1 A. C. M. is, on his own admission to me lately, of a definitely dissociative\ntype of mind, and has always been exceptionally good at abstracting his miad\nfrom immediate smroundings.\n\f270 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Octobeb 1938\nearlier when we met at Easter. And we certainly never discussed\nsuch names or incidents at any time, as he would also confirm.\nAs evidence of telepathy the case is a poor one, however sug-\ngestive ;\nbut, in view of the fact that I carefully recorded my\nvarious impressions, it is, I believe, of some interest psychologically\nand from the viewpoint of automatic and clairaudient phenomena,\nwhen we are considering the kind of mechanism by which such\nprocesses occur.\nMy brother has rightly pointed out certain anachronisms, of the\nexistence of which in the script, though I am not a classical scholar,\nI was mildly aware at the time ; so much so that I certainly should\nnot voluntarily have produced such a historical mixture. Nor is\nthe style, I think, at all my own, in its pleasantly rounded and self-\ncontained brevity. Then there was the very remarkable sense of\nobjectivity and extraneousness, the firm decision and abrupt begin-\nning and ending\u2014different from any minor \" inspirations \" or sub-\nconscious promptings that I ever remember to have received in\nliterary or scientific efforts of my own. Moreover, preceding it was\nthe reahstic and objectified voice of my wife, which equally took\nme by surprise, and which did not continue when I expected it to\ndo so, though I kept calm and receptive.\nNo matter how true it may be to suggest that the greater part\nof such a confabulation would seem to have been done by the\nautomatist's or clairaudient's (in this case my own) subconscious\nmind, utilising past memories and ideational associations, and thus\nmaking a little work of art out of a few bare and initially unco-\nordinated facts ; the nucleus or veridical core of the whole thing\nwould ajDpear to be substantial. In this case the core might, perhaps,\nbe whittled down to the two words Carthage and Sidon, plus, may\nbe, the idea of ships and of early Eoman times : the whole being\ncemented together by an awareness of the agent's (my brother's)\nindividual personality. But such a core does, I believe, generally\nexist ; and I venture to suggest that this little experience affords\na miniature picture of the sort of phenomena that are commonly\nproduced by automatists and trance mediums. And, if so, it is\nconceivable that, where some initial sjTnpathetic link may be said\nto exist between two living persons, or else one living and one\ndead, of whom one is in a suitable frame of mind to act as \" agent \",\nthe other as \" percipient \", then there may actually occur a rela-\ntively objective incursion of thought, (some component of per-\nsonality), from the former to the latter. Moreover, such an incursion\nmay occur quite involuntarily, may amount to partial possession of\nthe one person's psycho-physical organism by that of the other, and\n\fOctober 1938 Case 271\nmay feel as real and objective to the subject (or percipient or medium)\nhim- or herself as it sometimes also does to the onlookers.\nHaving more than once sensed these things personally while fully\nconscious and in a rational, though \" receptive,\" state of mind, I am\nprepared to vouch for the general truth of those many similar, but\noften profounder and more complete, experiences of trained mediums,\nclairvoyants, clairaudients, automatists, mystics, etc., which it is\nthe particular business of our Society to investigate and discuss.\nI would naturally welcome further analysis or any constructive\ncriticism by those in a position to give them. But such criticism\ncannot be counted constructive or of any real value if it merely\ndismisses the telepathic aspect of such cases as probably chance-\ncoincidence, and in any case worthless because they are spontaneous,\nor brushes aside the percipient's sensations as being of no account,\nsince they are merely subjective and personal. For, although it is\ntrue that such a spontaneous incident is, considered on its own\nmerits alone, necessarily somewhat inconclusive ;\nyet, when it is\nconsidered as an example among a great accumulation of such\nspontaneous cases, classifiable into groups that present common\nevidential features, then an example of that kind, critically con-\nsidered, may afford a key to at least one small door into the mys-\nterious precincts of the human mind and its workings. And it is\nmy belief that one case here and there of spontaneous extra-\nsensory perception or cognition, if properly recorded and analysed,\nis likely to afford more and surer information, and that, too, of a\nmore detailed kind, than thousands of statistical experiments done\nto order\u2014not that I wish to underrate the value of such experiments\nin their own line. The spontaneous case, however, is a natural\nproduct, occurring under natural circumstances (often very complex\ncircumstances), whereas the laboratory ex]Deriment, apart from\nbeing a simplified and meagre affair, is always likely to be arti-\nficialised, and hence will tend to present an unnatural and distorted\nview of the subject of study. That such is the fact has been demon-\nstrated time and again in physiology, anatomy, experimental psycho-\nlogy, and even in physics and chemistry. That is why the more\nartificial branches of biology, including physiology and experimental\npsychology, have lately come to such an impasse. For one cannot\nwith impunity study any single environmental factor in relation to\na given phenomenon\u2014especially a phenomenon of hfe\u2014with a total\ndisregard of the rest. And it is the interwoven complex of factors\nthat form what is known as \" the appropriate psychological atmo-\nsphere \" in parapsychology ; to disregard or interfere with which is\ngenerally to court failure.\n\f272 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1938\nI would like, therefore, to conclude this short paper by an appeal\nto students of Psychical Research to return to the serious study of\nspontaneous cases in equality with, if not in preference to, experi-\nmental results. For the former not only provide the richer and more\nnatural field for study, but, if a tolerably good extra-sensory per-\ncipient, medium or other subject can be found (as they can often\nbe found), and the latter can be trained to record and to some extent\nto analyse his or her own sensations and perceptions as a matter\nof routine, then the spontaneous cases will be found to occur suffi-\nciently frequently to enable them to be treated experimentally\n\u2014\nand even, if a sufiicient number accrues, also statistically. More-\nover, the conditions essential to natural occurrence can then also\nbe determined by subsequent inspection. That such is the case has,\nin fact, gradually become clear to me as a result of my own personal\nexperiences over some twenty years. Such experience has also con-\nfirmed me in the opinion that the occurrence of extra-sensory per-\nceptions of a simple order is by no means so uncommon amongst\npeople in general as is often maintained. The main trouble is that\nmost potential percipients are either insufficiently interested or\ninsufficiently introspective to realise the significance of such experi-\nences ; or else they tend quickly to forget about them, as one forgets\ndreams on waking : a fact that was also demonstrated by the early\nS.P.R. census of hallucinations. At the same time, it is not to be\ndenied that the frequent percipient is a relatively rara avis ; but\nthat, too, is, quite probably, partly a matter of personal interest\nin the action of an innate and relatively common, if not universal,\nfaculty. Good percipients, however, usually have something of the\ncontemplative, mystical, artistic, and mentally abstracted tempera-\nment about them.\nNote on \" two denarii a bucket\n\"\nThe cost of corn (? wheat) described by the voice as being \" cheap\nand plentiful \" at \" not more than two denarii a bucket \", is a point\nof interest. In the first place, I had no conscious knowledge of the\nvalue of a denarius, though long ago I may have read or been told\nof it. In the second place\u2014and this I can confidently assert\n\u2014\nI have never in any way interested myself in the present or past\ncost of wheat, etc., and certainly had no idea what grain measure\nan ordinary two- or three-gallon pail would hold. Nor, apparently,\nhad my brother. So that, unless one assumes (1) that we knew the\nvalue in present-day currency of a (silver) denarius, (2) knew the\npresent cost of corn, say, per bushel, and (3) knew what measure\nof corn an average bucket would hold\u2014all that in our subconscious\n\fOctober 1938 Case 273\nminds, plus the necessary calculations\u2014we could not, either of us,\nhave arrived at the knowledge implied by the \" commimicator's\n\"\nstatement.\nNow my brother, in his letter, at once expressed the opinion that\ntwo denarii was dear for a bucket of corn, though he has no special\nknowledge of the subject. Neither did he refer the statement to\nany information in his possession. On looking into an old dictionary\nI subsequently found that a silver denarius was reckoned, early last\ncentury, to be equivalent to about 7|d., which would make two\nsuch coins worth about '2s. 7d. at the present-day value of our money\n(rating it at roughly twice what it was about a hundred years ago).\nAnd, taking \" a bucket \" to mean an ordinary three-gallon pail,\nfarming neighbours tell me that such a quantity would now be\nworth quite 3s. One may, therefore, conclude that corn y)as indeed\n\" cheap \", but otherwise about normally priced, at 2s. 7d. a bucket\n\u2014\nas the \" communicator \" asserted ;\nthough neither my brother nor\nI had any certain views on the question ourselves, and oiir farmer\nfriends had to scratch their heads for some time before arriving at\na present price for such a measure. (Three were consulted.)\nAddendum\nA further small incident indicative of mutual telepathy has\noccurred since the foregoing account was first drafted ; I give it\nfor what it may be worth without detailed comment\n:\nOne evening in July, while I was considering in my mind the need\nof some hedge-trimming near our front garden gate (which has\nrecently been repainted), I suddenly and \"as if from nowhere\n\"\nfound myself in a kind of day-dream, in which I was busy fixing a\nrather blatant and surburban-looking name-plate with large gilded\nletters to the gate in question. The next moment I was conscious\nof the aberration, and saying to myself :\n\" How ridiculous and\nbeastly in a little rural village such as ours! Whatever could have\ngiven me such a preposterous idea?\n\"\nThe picture was very realistic, and I told a neighbour (a sculptor)\nof it the next day when we met. He and three other people can\nconfirm these facts along with the sequel about to be described.\n^\nSome three or four days later my brother from Oxford visited us\nin company with a Miss T., and, during the course of a conversation\nabout the house, mentioned that he had had a dream a few nights\nbefore to the effect that we had re-named our house rather curiously,\nbut that he could not recollect the name or further details. And\n1 The corroboration here mentioned is on record at the S.P.R. Rooms.\n\f274 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1938\nhe agreed that it would have been about the same time as my day-\ndream\u2014probably either the night before or after it. My wife and\nMiss T. were also present at our conversation, and I naturally told\nthem of my own experience, which seemed obviously to link up with\nmy brother's dream, as neither of us had any evident reason for\nour fantasies. J. Cecil Maby.\nCORRESPONDENCE\nExperiment in Extra-Sensory Perception\nSir,\u2014Mr Soal, in his review of two books (Ernest Hunter Wright,\nThe Case for Telepathy, and Professor Chester E. Kellog, New Evi-\ndence (?) for \" Extra-Sensory Perception \", Proc. S.P.R. Vol. XLV,\npp. 88-96), makes the following criticisms of my work. (1) He\ncomplains that I have published no lists of the cards used in my\ncard-experiments in Pure Telepathy, saying (p. 91) :\n\" Neither Dr\nRhine nor Mr Tyrrell have published lists of the card-images used\nin their experiments in Pure Telepathy \". If I understand him\nrightly his argument is that in experiments in pure telepathy, in\nwhich no actual cards are used, but both agent and percipient\nmentally select the card-images they use, there is not a truly random\nsequence of card-images on either side. Consequently the exact\nprobability of chance-success needs to be deduced from a record of\nthe order of guesses. This is a point to be borne in mind by anyone\ncarrying out this kind of investigation ; but I have neither made nor\npublished any exjjeriments in pure telepathy.\n(2) On the same page, Mr Soal says :\n\" The next important\ncriticism that Professor Kellog makes is that Dr Rhine (and the\nsame observation applies to Mr Tyrrell) refuses to record and\nanalyse the sum total of his records. If the subjects do badly on\ncertain days, then it is said that the failure is due to some psycho-\nlogical disturbance and the results on such days are ignored. But\nas obviously the statistical data themselves are the only criterion\nof the existence of an extra-sensory factor we are, if we adopt such\nmethods, moving in a vicious circle.\"\nIt is a pity that Mr Soal's criticisms are vague as well as inaccurate.\nIt sounds as if he meant that I have discarded the results of poor\nsittings after the sittings were held and have counted only the results\nof the good sittings. If he does mean this, the statement is untrue.\nSurely no rational experimenter would merely pick out the best\nscores! What I have done is to decide on certain days beforehand\n\fOctober 1938 Correspondence 275\nthat the results of that day's sittings should not be counted, whether\nthey were good or bad. It is advisable to do this if a run of failures\nis having a discouraging effect on the subject. Excejjt for this,\neverything has been counted. May I ask Mr Soal whether he sees\nany objection to this procedure ;\nand, if so, what his objection is?\nMr Soal seems (I am obliged to say \" seems \" until he deviates\ninto clarity) to cast certain doubts on the supernormality of my\nresults in general, as well as hinting that the use of the Commutator\nis unsound. He published the following in Light of 9 June. 1938 :\n\" To select a few good scores from a large mass of indifferent ones\nand then, when the subjects who have produced these exceptional\nscores fail to guess above chance-expectation, to argue that they\nhave '\nlost their power '\nis a travesty of scientific method. The same\nobjections apply to the experiments of Mr G. N. Tyrrell, who, I\nunderstand, has not even kept a record of all his data. All Mr\nTyrrell's early work was vitiated by the elementary fact that the\nsubject and the experimenter were able consciously, or uncon-\nsciously, to correlate their number or position habits. But, even\nhad they not been able to do so, it would be an error to assume that,\nwhen two non-random distributions are paired off against each\nother, the mean chance expectation is the same as when both the\nsequences are random or haphazard. I have not actually seen Mr\nTyrrell's new electrical apparatus, but Mr C. V. C. Herbert assures\nme that there are serious objections to the use of the commutator.\"\nI should have no objection to Mr Soal's doubts and criticisms if,\ninstead of making statements of this kind, he would give clear\nreplies to the facts and arguments which I have summarised in\nJournal S.P.R. Vol. xxx, pp. 223-6\u2014facts and arguments which\npoint directly to the supernormal character of the results ; and if he\nwould further state what is wrong with the use of the commutator.\nBut clear statements on these points he has never made. Let me\nconfine myself to a single issue, however. Mr Soal has said or\nimplied that no positive experimental results in E.S.P., occurring\nunder test conditions, have been obtained on this side of the Atlantic.\nIn Proc. S.P.R. Vol. XLIV, pp. 150-1, he will notice that, with the\nElectrical Machine, Miss G. M. Johnson, as percipient, scored 1841\nsuccesses in 7809 trials. The conditions were as follows : (i) The\norder of the keys pressed by the operator was taken from a list of\nfigures, which had been written down on cards from numbers taken\ndirectly from the tested Mechanical Selector. They were therefore\na random series, (ii) The Commutator was used and was reset from\ntime to time during the experiments in positions unknown to the\noperator, (iii) The trials took place at a speed of about 60 to the\n\f276 Jour7ial of Society for Psychical Research October 1938\nminute, and the odds against success by chance is of the order of a\nbillion to one. Does Mr Soal think that this result was due to\nchance? If not, has he any normal explanation of it to offer ? Is\nhe prepared to demonstrate this explanation, if he has it, by taking\nthe percipient's place at the apparatus and producing 1841 successes\nin 7809 trials, showing at the same time the normal method by which\nhe does it? If he is prepared to do this, some definiteness will have\nbeen imported into his nebulous criticisms, and I shall be the first\nto publish and acknowledge the normal method of working the\nmachine which can produce this result. Mr Soal would work under\nexactly the same conditions as Miss Johnson. If he maintains that\nshe scored by a normal method, he should be prepared to show what\nit is. Mr Herbert has the tape-records of these experiments at the\nrooms of the S.P.R. and Mr Soal is at liberty to analyse them if he\nlikes. But the fact which demands explanation is simply how 1841\nsuccesses were scored in 7809 trials.\nI shall probably be asked in return to repeat the results with Miss\nJohnson for all to see ; and I quite agree that that would be the\nmost satisfactory thing to do if it were possible. But I cannot do\nthis. I have never claimed to be able to reproduce any result at aU\nto order. I do not know why I get positive results occasionally and\nnot at other times. It is just a fact of experience ; and it is surely\nfoolish to say that the experiments ought to be repeatable at will\nwhen experience shows that they are not. All I can say about the\nconditions is that I have observed that the right mental state\ndepends upon very slight and very general factors and is at the\nmercy of all kinds of outside influences, which, at fijst sight, might\nbe assumed to be negligible. It may be possible to get more results\nin the future. I hope so, but I cannot guarantee it.\nIt seems opportune to remark here that, although clear and\ndefinite criticism is of the greatest value in psychical research, vague\nand inaccurate criticism is worse than useless ;\nand, in particular,\nthe type of criticism which insinuates that something is wrong but\ncannot say what the something is, has the deplorable effect of\nmuddling the mind of the onlooker and of sowing unformulated\nsuspicion. It gives the public a quite unnecessary and gratuitous\nreason for ignoring psychical research and is exactly the thing which\nmost vitiates a scientific inquiry.\nYours, etc., Gr. N. M. Tyrrell.\n\fOCTOBEE 1938 Revieiv 211\nEEVIEW\nDiscarnate Influence m Human Life. By Ernesto Bozzako. Trans-\nlated by Isabel Emerson. Library of the International Institute\nfor Psychical Research. Volume I. Published by John M.\nWaters. 8s. 6d.\nIn this first volume of the Library to be issued by the International\nInstitute for Psychical Research, Signor Bozzano takes as his thesis\nthe proposition that \" Animism proves Spiritualism \". The term\n\" Animism \" appears to be here used to mean the supernormal\nactivities of the subliminal mind of an incarnate himian being. It\nis, perhaps, a pity that this word has been thus employed, as it has\nalready been used by philosophers and psychologists in a completely\ndifferent sense. In his first chapter the author argues that the super-\nnormal faculties of the subliminal mind are not the product of\nbiological evolution and that the \" integral subconscious personahty\nis a spiritual entity independent of any functional interference, direct\nor indirect, from the brain \". The reasoning employed appears to\nme to be weak, and I cannot see that the conclusion at which the\nauthor arrives is established thereby. In his second chapter he\nattempts to assign limits to subliminal faculty and cites cases in\nsupport of his argument. Here again I fail to see that he establishes\nhis position. The alternative explanations which he brings forward\nfor cases which appear to go against his theory rest, as it seems to\nme, on unproved assumptions.\nI do not, for a moment, suggest that there are no limits to sub-\nliminal faculty, in fact the difficulty of accounting for \" selection\n\"\nrather tends to show the contrary, but I doubt whether he is correct\nin those which he assigns.\nIn the next two chapters he discusses the phenomena of super-\nnormal communication between the living and of bilocation ; he\nbrings foward some remarkable and interesting evidence.\nThe fourth chapter consists of a Summary of Evidence, and here\nagain some excellent cases are quoted. Finally, in his last chapter\nhe sums up his arguments.\nI express no opinion as to the CAadential value of the cases which\nare given, though some are undoubtedly good ; it is the inferences\nwhich he seeks to draw, and his methods of drawing them, which\nI feel bound to criticise. This cannot be done in detail within the\nscope of a review, but I would like to give a specimen as a sample\nof the type of reasoning generally employed. On pages 219 et seq.\nhe gives a resume of a case wherein a medium is said to have given\nveridical information concerning two boys who were drowned and\n\f278 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1938\nthe body of one of them mutilated by a shark. The medium first\nheld the hand of the mother and obtained only an impression of\nthe sea and of great distress. He was then given a pocket-book\nwhich had belonged to one of the deceased and at once gave a full\naccount of the accident in which they lost their lives. Signor Bozzano\nremarks \" although the medium held the hand of Mrs Browne, the\nmother of the dead boys, he did not succeed in revealing anything\nconcerning their fate \", \" this shows that her subconscious had not\nperceived the circumstances of the tragedy telepathically \". He\nclaims that this \" circumstance absolutely refutes the hypothesis\nthat relations . . . would telepath all the vicissitudes of their lives\nto their relations ...\" and that a sensitive \" would extract it from\ntheir subconscious \".\nI think that comment is unnecessary ; I know of no grounds for\nsupposing that the mere holding of the hand constitutes an \" open\nsesame \" to the subconscious mind.\nIn my opinion the author would have made out a much stronger\ncase if he had not tried to make it quite so strong. Much of the\nbook's content is interesting and some is suggestive, but when it is\nclaimed that the inferences drawn are \" rigorously logical deductions\nfrom the facts \" I feel bound to demur. H. F. Saltmarsh.\nNOTES ON PEEIODICALS\nTijdschrift voor Parapsychologie (May 1938).\nFrom Paraqmjchology to Mysticism. By Dr P. A. Dietz.\nDr Dietz divides psychic phenomena into three groups :\n(1)\nMediumistic, (2) Magic, and (3) Mystic. He disputes the assertion\nthat telepathy is a temporary intensification of perception by means\nof which the percipient obtains access to the \" universal conscious-\nness \". He discusses stigmata, telekinesis and the appearance of\nphantoms (spontaneous). In the course of his remarks on magic he\nrefers to the marvels connected with Hatha Yoga and to the works\nof Paracelsus. In dealing with Mysticism he makes interesting\nreferences to the subject of the unio mystica as conceived in the West\nand the East.\nTrance mid Brain-function. By L. J.

H. C. Tenhaeff.\nDr Tenhaeff gives details of 14 remarkable dreams and concludes\nwith the observation that dream phenomena such as he describes\ncannot be explained by any means as \" natural \" (naturalistic)\nphenomena.\nRevue Metaphysique (March-April 1938).\nPsychism and Yoga. By Dr Therese Brosse.\nDr Brosse, studying the relation of conscious activity with\npsycho-physiological life, visited India for the purpose of investigat-\ning Yoga. She comes to the conclusion that psychic powers have\nbeen \" bequeathed to man from the animal \" and inhibited in him\nby his human individuality. Yoga, she explains, is not a system\ndirected towards the obtaining of psychic power, but towards the\nhberation of the human consciousness (individuality) from organic\nrestrictions, in order to attain union with the transcendental. She\nwas able to secure the co-operation of yoghi and to obtain graphs of\ntheir respiration and pulse in states induced during their exercises.\nShe compares the physiological state of suspended animation, which\nenables yoghi to be buried for various periods of time and yet survive,\nto the hibernative state of certain animals. Abnormal phenomena\n(psychic manifestations) are not in Dr Brosse's view a sign of evolu-\ntion towards higher levels in man, since he shares them with animals ;\nbut his individuality (ego, spu-it), being imperfect or incomplete in\nitself, has inhibited the use of them. The individuality (spirit),\nattaining to self-mastery, can remove this inhibition.\nHypnotism and ScopocJiloralose. By Dr Pascal.\nThe author is of opinion that the effects following the injection of\nscopochloralose are in part (80 per cent.) due to suggestion. This\ndrug greatly increases suggestibility. Dr Pascal stresses its useful-\nness before operations and in maternity cases.\nTHE AUTUMN LECTURES\nIt has been represented to the Council that some of the papers\nread at the Society's meetings or published in Proceedings are\ndifficult for newly-joined members, or the outside public, to follow\nas they require a considerable knowledge of work already done by\nthe Society. The CouncU have therefore decided to hold two series\nof lectures, open to the pubhc, during the autumn, at which a\n\f280 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1938\ngeneral survey will be given both of the past work of the Society\nand of the problems on which it is now engaged. A leaflet giving\nparticulars of the lectures is enclosed, and it is hoped that members\nwill support the lectures both by taking tickets themselves, and\nalso by bringing the lectures to the notice of their friends.\nTHE JOURNAL IS FEINTED FOR FRIVATE\nCIRCULATION\nThe attention of Members and Associates is drawn to the private\nnature of the Journal, from which no quotations should be made with-\nout the previous consent of the Council. Ever since the first issue of\nthe Journal in 1884, much of the material appearing in it has been\ncontributed on the definite assurance that the Journal is, as stated\non the cover, issued \" For private circulation among Members and\nAssociates only \". The Council hope that all Members and Associates\nwill continue to co-operate with them in maintaining this privacy.\n\fNo. 549.\u2014Vol. XXX November 1938\nJOURNAL\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research\nNOTICE OF MEETING\nA Private Meeting of the Society\nWILL BE HELD IN\nTHE SOCIETY'S LIBRARY\n31 TAVISTOCK SQUARE, LONDON, W.C. i\nON\nIVEBNESDAT, 30th November, igjS, at 5-50 p.m.\nWHEN A PAPER ENTITLED\n\" Henry Sidgwick and Psychical Research\n\"\nBY\nProfessor C.

This was in reply to her guarded question\nas to \" what they thought of things \".\nThe communication made the following points :\n\\. \" There will be re-assuring news. . .\n.\"\n(Godesberg.)\n2. \" Then a scare looking like a breakdown. ...\"\n(It will be agreed that from the 24th September to the 27th there\nwas a scare. Gas masks were being fitted and distributed, the Fleet\nmobilized, and the announcement made that Britain would join\nFrance if the Czechs were attacked.)\n3. \" Followed again by a strengthening of the Peace move and\nwhat he hopes and believes is safety. . . . You should hear some-\nthing definite in ten days. ...\"\n(It is striking that the Munich Agreement was signed on tlie tenth\nday after this sitting\u2014at 1.30 a.m., September 30th.)\n\" Keep your mind at peace and don't let other people's thoughts\naffect you. ... I think you will find it will be as we say, peace for\nthis country.\"\nExtracts from, a sitting taken by Lady Dewar with\nMrs Leonard, 20th September 1938.\nQuestion : What do you think about things?\nReply :\n\" Peace will be kept in spite of muddle and trouble some\npeople try to make\u2014we think we shall do it\u2014if we do, you must\nbe prepared for a kind of re-organization of political and inter-\nnational matters on a different scale to any that have been before.\nDon't wonder if it is all right, it will be better than war\u2014there is\ngoing to be a re-shufiling of things . . . but, but, we feel that in order\nto avert it now, at this very dangerous and critical stage we may\nhave to pay a price. If people grumble tell them it is better than\nthe other thing\u2014war. . . . This is not to be done easily but he feels\npeace will be kept. I mean peace as far as this country is con-\ncerned, but in one or two others there will be local trouble.\"\nQuestion : When will we know?\nReply :\n\" There will be a scare in the middle\u2014he gives 10\u2014you\nshould hear something definite in 10 days\u2014there will be reassuring\n\f284 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1938\nnews, then a scare looking like a breakdown, followed again by a\nstrengthening of the peace move, and what he hopes and believes\nis safety. [Feda aside : These old people with shirts is a nuisance!)\nThey have come to stay, not to be washed out ... all we can do,\nunless we want them to lead us into great trouble, is to co-operate\nwitli them ... it is not a case of minding or not minding, it is a\ncase of accepting the inevitable. He heard the silly remarks you\nheard about being loyal\u2014as if we were letting people down\u2014we\nshall suffer more if we are silly. Render unto Caesar the things that\nare Caesar's. The lesser of two evils. Steadfast thought and prayer\nare necessary on earth. That makes a foundation for us to work\nupon. Keep your mind at peace and don't let other people's thoughts\naffect you. And he keeps giving 10. Don't forget a scare, a hitch\nyou might think it. Don't worry. Keep calm and I think you will\nfind it will be as we say\u2014peace for this country.

When I asked\nthe c[uestion I did not expect sucli a detailed answer. I told no\none of the prediction. The ten days is curious, isn't it?\n\" For four or five days I heard every morning as I woke, '\nThere\nwon't l)e a war.' On the 30th I did not get this message but I\nheard, '\nI told you so.' This came a little later than the previous\nmessages and I, curiously, didn't connect it until about 8.30 a.m.\nmy son-in-law called out '\nThe Munich Agreement is signed '. Not\nuntil then did I connect the '\nI told you so '\nwhich was given about\nten minutes earlier.\n\" I felt there would be no war, luit I had no idea how it was\ngoing to be averted.\"\nAs Lady Dewar had not mentioned this prediction till after the\nevent she sent me the actual notes written by her during the sitting.\nWith them I have compared the above extract and find it accurate.\nC. Drayton Thomas.\nCASE : A DREAM SUGGESTING TELEPATHY\nThis case was sent to, and investigated by, Mr G. N. M. Tyrrell,\nthe sender in the first instance being a Mr R. Mr R.'s son was\nbitten by an adder which he had picked up ; tliere was some anxiety\n\fNovember 1938 Case 285\nabout the boy's condition, and the same night a Miss F., who was\nwith the E. family, wrote to her mother describing the incident.\nDuring this night Miss F.'s father had a dream, and told it to his\nwife, in which someone had picked up an adder and Mr F. was\ntrying to call out, \" put it down \".\nThe details of this occurrence will be clear from the correspondence,\nof which the relevant portions are printed below. The original\ndocuments are on the S.P.R. files.\nMr R. to Mr Tyrrell. Sept. 11, '38.\nI append an account of the facts as I recall them and I am asking\nMiss F. and her father to write independently, so that you can check\nup on any variations.\nThe incident took place on Monday, August 15th [1938]. We had\nset out for a picnic by bus. The party consisted of my wife, myself,\nour two sons aged' 16 and 18, Miss F. and our houseman. We arrived\nabout 3. There was a foothpath which led to the sea with grassland\non the left side and brambles and heather on the right. I wandered\ndown to the shore with the boys, while my wife and Miss F. selected\na spot for sketching. We returned about 4. My wife and Miss F.\nwere then sketching by the footpath. I stayed behind with tlie\nyounger boy to talk to the houseman. My elder boy joined the\nartists. I saw my wife pointing but before I could reach tliem 1 saw\nmy boy in obvious distress with his finger. He had seen an adder\non a grassy hillock by a gorse bush, flung his handkerchief over it\nand grabbed it. My wife called to him to let it go. On releasing\nhis grasp he was Intten on the third finger of the left hand. We\ngot a car and rushed him off to hospital. We rang up about 10.30\nand learnt that his condition was considerably improved after the\nadministering of serum. I think these are all the details, but I will\nget my wife to confirm.\nPostscript by Mrs K.\nI confirm the above account, except for the detail that it was the\nfirst finger that was bitten and not the third.\n[In reply to a question from Mr Tyrrell, Mr R. notes that the boy\nknew the difference between an adder and a grass snake l:)ut did\nnot take time to look, and had not thought that an adder's l>ite\nwas dangerous. \" Snake hunting \", Mr R. adds, \" was not an\nobjective of the expedition and had not, I think, been mentioned.\nAs we have never met Mr F., no thought of it could have occurred\nto him.\"]\n\f286 journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1938\nMiss F. to Mr Tyrrell. Sept. 14, '38.\nMr R. has told me you would like my account of the snake acci-\ndent and also of the dream. It certainly is a curious thing that my\nfather should have had that dream the night after Mr R.'s son was\nbitten.\nIt was Aug. 15th and the time just before 4 p.m. when we had\ntaken a jDicnic out on to some heather and grassland. . . . Mrs R.\nand I were sitting doing some sketching when her son called out\nhe had got a snake. I jumped up and rushed to where he was,\nabout 4 ft. from me, and was horrified to see his hand closed over\nthe snake which I at once saw was an adder. I shouted to him to\nleave it, telling him what kind it was and it would bite him, but\ninstead he picked it up and was bitten. For that moment the shock\nwas great as I knew the danger of such a thing. ... I can't remember\nthinking of father al^out that time, but that evening I was thinking\nof writing home and telling them. I did not do so till next day.\nMother wrote to me on the Wednesday after getting my letter which\nI had posted the day before. And the words she used were these :\n\" A strange thing Monday night, Daddy was making an awful noise\nin his sleep and I woke him up and said, '\nWhatever were you dream-\ning? '\nand he said, '\nI thought someone was holding a snake.' I\nforget what else he said.\" Father and I have found telepathy has\ntaken [place] between us before.\n[Miss F., writing four weeks after the event, says here that she\ndid not write to her parents until Tuesday (Aug. 16), the day after\nthe incident. Actually her letter, which was kept with its envelope,\nappears to have been written (at least in part) the same night, and\nposted next day. The envelope is postmarked 2.15 on the 16th.\nAn extract follows.]\nMiss F. to Mrs F. Letter dated \" Monday even.\"\nI had every intention of writing early and posting to-night but\nI'm afraid it has been impossible. [The afternoon's expedition is\nthen mentioned and the letter proceeds :] T. . . . called out he had\ncaught a snake\u2014and he was holding in his hand an enormous adder.\nI shouted to him to drop it and he still held on and then he was\nbitten. Well, I have no time now to tell you all details except he\nis very ill in hospital and serum has been sent from London. Good-\nness knows what's going to happen. Everyone is so miserable, I\nhave been sitting with Mrs R. till nearly 12 and now I've come to\nbed.\nI will think of you at 2 a.m.\n\fNOVEMBEB 1938 Case 287\nMr F. to Mr Tyrrell. Sept. 19, '38.\nDuring the night of Monday Aug. 15th I had a most vivid dream\n\u2014I dreamed that someone, I don't know who, had picked up an\nadder and was holding it in his left hand. I only saw his hand and\npart of his sleeve and some grass in the background. I was en-\ndeavouring to say \" put it down, put it down \" and made such a\nnoise that I awakened my wife, who in turn roused me. She asked\nme what was the matter, and I said that I dreamed that someone\npicked up an adder.\nI cannot say at what time in the night I had the dream, but it\nwas quite dark. I had no reason to think of snakes and cannot\nremember ever having dreamed of them before.\nIt was not until the following Wednesday, Aug. 17th, that we\nreceived the news\u2014I enclose in original my daughter's letter [quoted\nin the preceding section of this report]. \" I will think of you at\n2 a.m.\" had no reference to the adder, but to something that my\nwife had told her\u2014but this in itself is rather curious.\nI have had other curious dreams\u2014as I suppose most people have\n\u2014but not one that I could definitely connect with an actual event\nof which I had no knowledge at the time. I have, however, had\nseveral rather curious experiences\u2014one with my daughter\u2014which\nmight be attributed to telepathy.\nI do feel that this experience is rather unique. I should have\nthought that the telepathic message, if there is such a thing, was\nconveyed to me while my daughter was writing to her mother.\n[Before Mr Tyrrell had known of this letter, he had suggested that\nthe dream could have arisen from a delayed telepathic impression,\nreceived at the time of the accident.]\nI enclose a statement from my wife which corroborates what I\nhave said.\nMrs F. to Mr Tyrrell. {Enclosed with the preceding letter.)\nI only remember my husband making an awful moaning and\ngroaning in his sleep and I said, \" Whatever is the matter? \" He\nrephed, \" I thought someone was holding an adder.\" I replied,\n\" Whatever makes you dream about a snake \"\n\u2014this very irritably!\n\u2014as it seemed that I had only just got off to sleep.\nWe did not mention it again until I read my daughter's letter,\non the following Wednesday morning, to my husband.

N. M. Tyrrell's comments on my criticisms of liis\nexperiments call for brief rejolies :\n(1) Mr Tyrrell's early experiments with his pointer apparatus\nare certainly not tests in Pure Telepathy, but the same objections\napply to them as to Dr Rhine's experiments in Pure Telepathy\nand it was for that reason I classed them hastily under the same\nheading. But Mr Tyrrell's pointer method has the additional\ndisadvantage that since the experimenter sees what the subject\nhas done after each trial he may unconsciously vary and adjust\nhis own position habits to accord with the particular schemes\nwhich the subject is using at the moment. I repeat that in such\ncases the true mean chance expectation is not even approximately\nknown. It is no answer for Mr Tyrrell to employ a thoroughly\nunsound statistical method and then try to convince his readers\nby arguments on other grounds that his results are due to extra-\nsensory perception. He ought never to have used the method in\nthe first place.\n(2) I am at a complete loss to understand why Mr Tyrrell should\ndecide beforehand that on certain days the results are not to be\ncounted. If the day's work is not to be published surely there is\nlittle point in doing the experiments on such days. If, as he\nmaintains. Miss Johnson is encouraged by being told that the bad\nresults are not to be published she must experience an equal\nmeasure of discouragement when she obtains good results and\nthese have to be ignored. By using such a practice Mr Tyrrell is\nsimply not making a full statistical use of all his data. Surely\nMr Tyrrell ought in a scientific report to give us a complete and\nsystematic statistical analysis of the whole of his results? We\nrequire something beyond an elementary application of the\nformula Jnfq. Any schoolboy could give us as much as this.\n(3) May I ask Mr Tyrrell if Miss Johnson's miraculous feat of\nscoring 1841 successes in some 7800 trials was witnessed by any\ncompetent experimenter in addition to himself ? I have failed to\nfind any record of such witnesses. Speaking purely for myself I\nslioidd not have the temerity to publish such a claim on the mere\nstrength of being able to produce a piece of tape. If I was unable\nto obtain similar results in the presence of competent observers\nI should\u2014unlike Mr Tyrrell\u2014prefer to remain silent. I can at least\n\fNovember 1938 Correspondence 289\nmaintain that my own experimental work has been done in the\npresence of witnesses and under conditions which have some claim\nto be called scientific. Results which cannot be produced in the\npresence of competent witnesses again and again have in my\nopinion no place in experimental science, whatever value they may\npossess for the individual experimenter.\n(4) It is surely not up to me to produce extra-chance results with\nMr Tyrrell's electrical apparatus. It is rather for Mr Tyrrell to\ndemonstrate to me practically that Miss Johnson can actually\nproduce such results under unimpeachable conditions. In other\nwords I should require to witness the actual production of success-\nful results which is another matter from merely inspecting the\napparatus. I say that this is not a matter of beUef or disbehef of\nMr Tyrrell's own assurances ; it is a deeper question of scientific\nprinciple. Let us grant that Mr Tyrrell cannot guarantee that his\nmiracles (for miracles they are in the light of present-day psycho-\nlogical knowledge) will occur at a given sitting. Well, I hope I am\nreasonable and I should be willing to watch patiently at a dozen\nsittings in the expectation of seeing something definitely abnormal.\nIn fact if Miss Johnson can demonstrate clairvoyance on a one in\nten thousand chance using a sequence of numbers chosen by myself\nfrom Tippett's random tables and dispensing with the com-\nmutator, and succeeds in the presence of either Mr Whateley\nCarington and myself or Mr Oliver Gatty and myself, I will gladly\npay twenty pounds to any organisation that Mr Tyrrell cares to\nsuogest. I can hardly speak fairer than that.\nYours faithfully, S. G. Soal.\nMr Tyrrell writes : Mr Soal has not answered my questions ;\nbut, with regard to his points : (1) The rough proof that the proba-\nbility of success with the Pointer Apparatus is very close to one-\nfifth is that most of the subjects, who were tried with it, scored\nchance results with calculations based on that assumption. The\nmethod was admittedly imperfect : that is why I made the\nElectrical Apparatus. But I maintain that Miss Johnson's results\nwere so high that Mr Soal's suggestion does not come anywhere\nnear to being a reasonable explanation of them.\n(2) I suppose that Mr Soal's preference for mass-methods, in\nwhich he never studies a sensitive subject, is the cause of his asking\ntvhij I sometimes decide beforehand to do experiments which are\nexcluded from the general results. If low spirits, ill-health or any\nother cause makes it likely that the subject will not score, it is\nwise to do uncounted experiments until the score begins to rise. If\n\f290 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1938\nyou count these, the subject knows that chance-results are piUng\nup, and this knowledge inhibits success. If you simply wait, you\nwill never know when to begin again. It seems incredible that Mr\nSoal should have plodded through all the work he has without\nhaving discovered these things. But that is beside the point. I\nasked Mr Soal on what grounds he objected to my deciding not to\ncount certain results beforehand. He has not answered. Presumably\nhe knows that there is no statistical objection to doing this. If\nthere is, I should be glad if any expert will tell me what it is.\nPresumably, also, Mr Soal knows that the formula Jwpq is quite\nadequate to decide whether the results quoted in the present case\nare above significance or not. This point he evades.\n(3) I have no objection to the presence of witnesses, if they do\nnot upset the delicate conditions necessary for success. The\ndifficulty is a practical one. Since one cannot work to predeter-\nmined times, witnesses would have to live in the house in which the\nexperiments were carried out, in order to be on the spot when\nrequired ; and this is impracticable. There were no witnesses of the\nexperiments referred to in my last letter : but there are the tape\nrecords. If these are not accepted as evidence, the only inference\nis that I must have fraudulently concocted them ; and to this, no\nanswer of mine is of any avail.\n(4) It would certainly be convenient if we could lay it down that\nat least one of a given series of sittings, predetermined as to dates\nand witnesses, must certainly give positive results, if it be true\nthat the subject possesses any extra-sensory faculty. Unfor-\ntunately, experience shows that this is what cannot be done\u2014at\nleast, with the present subject. The thing is far too elusive to\nguarantee. I gather that Mr Soal insists that E.S.P. must be\nguaranteeable if it is to be scientifically demonstrable. But that is\nto force conditions upon the phenomenon\u2014a thing which is the\nvery antithesis of scientific method. It is no good saying \" must \"\nor \" ought \" to nature. That is how King Canute got his feet wet!\nI regret that Mr Soal has failed to answer the questions which I\nput to him in order to clarify his criticisms of my work. In view of\nthis, I feel constrained to reiterate my protest against the tenden-\ntious type of criticism, which the author of it, having spread it\nabroad, cannot justify when the points are made specific.\nG.

Count\nPerovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo in the Chair.\nA paper entitled \" Henry Sidgwick and Psychical Research \" was\nread by Professor C. D. Broad. A discussion followed, in which\nMr Besterman, Dr Fodor, Mr Herbert and Mr Richmond took part.\nThe paper is pubhshed in the accompanying Part of Proceedings.\n\fDecember 1938 Evidence for Extra-Sensory Perception 295\nSOME EARLY EXPERIMENTS PROVIDING APPARENTLY\nPOSITIVE EVIDENCE FOR EXTRA-SENSORY PERCEPTION\nAs reported in the Journal for July last Mr Whately Carington on the\n29 Jiine 1938 read a paper with the above title ; the following is an\nabridgment of his paper.\nSome months ago, it had occurred to huxi that it might be worth\nwhile to review the more important quantitative experunents on\nE.S.P. of relatively early date. He had been prompted to do this\npartly by Prof. Thouless' discussion of Prof. Coover's work, in which\nhe showed that the results obtained were clearly not attributable to\nchance, as Coover had affirmed, and partly because he felt it was high\ntime to ascertain what solid foundation, if any, there was for the\ncomparatively widespread belief in the alleged phenomena of tele-\npathy and clairvoyance. It seemed to him that this behef rested\nalmost entirely on anecdotal material which, however striking, could\nnever supply the requisite combination of leak-proof conditions,\npositive results and the possibility of deciding on the hkehhood\nof those results being due to chance, although it might provide a\nvaluable stimulus to research or illuminate the nature of the pro-\ncess at work. He accordingly determined to concentrate entirely\non experiments which were either designedly quantitative in the\nfirst instance, or, as in a few cases, provided results which could\nbe subjected to quantitative treatment by methods not available\nat the time the work was done. His remarks were in the nature of\na provisional and interim account of what he had found.\nA great deal of pseudo-quantitative material had to be rejected\naltogether on the ground of manifestly imperfect conditions or\nsuspicion of fraud. He had also fought shy, on principle, of all cases\nin which enthusiasts had reported results of astronomical improba-\nbiUty obtained under conditions only sketchily described, even when\nthose conditions were apparently good enough to exclude normal\nmeans of cognition. He had been chiefly interested either in cases\nsuch as those of Coover or Troland in which the experimenter\n.\nreported as negative results which were demonstrably positive, or\nin those where some feature of the data quite miremarked by the\nexperimenter at the time\u2014such as progressive improvement or\ndeterioration with time, or abnormally low scoring\u2014could be shown\nto depart significantly from what we should expect if chance alone\nwere at work.\nThis kind of thing, provided it was of a character which could\nnot plausibly be ascribed to faulty conditions of experiment, was\nvery much more convincing than more showy and spectacular\nU 2\n\f296 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1938\nresults, as it was difficult to imagine that even the most depraved\nexperimenter or percipient, or both in collusion, would take the\ntrouble to fake an elaborate set of data\u2014and then omit to claim\ncredit for the apparently paranormal results shown by them.\nCoover's work was the classical example of this kind of evidence.\nHe evidently suffered from a singularly strong resistance to admitting\nevidence in favour of E.S.P., and declared in the strongest terms that\nhis results showed no trace of anything beyond chance. Actually,\nthe odds were some thousands to one against chance alone being\nresponsible for them ; but it would be quite unreasonable to suppose\nthat he first falsified his figures in an anti-chance sense, and then\nexercised a perverted ingenuity to attribute them to chance.\nWe might accordingly accept his figures without appreciable re-\nserve, and since they could not plausibly be ascribed to chance, the\nonly question that remained was whether they were due to unwitting\nleakage of information through normal channels, to faulty experi-\nmental methods, or to dehberate malpractice on the part of the\nstudents. On the whole, the internal evidence strongly contra-\nindicated all these possibihties. The more one went into the\nfigures the more difficult it became to account for them on these\nlines. Prof. Burt had estimated the combined chance of their being\nfortuitous at no more than about 1 in 50,000, and some of the\nfeatures observed, such as the correlations between different types\nof success under the different conditions, seemed almost impossible\nto ascribe to leakage or cheating.\nIn some respects an even more interesting example of the same\nkind of thing was afforded by the work of Dr Troland, who carried\nCoover's disregard of the desires of benefactors to a point which\ncould only be described as audaciously callous. Like Coover, he\nattempted to investigate telepathy\u2014or, more strictly, mixed extra-\nsensory perception\u2014and hke him announced that he could find no\nindication of it. But Coover did at least collect some 12,000 odd\nrelevant observations and wrote 641 pages of mingled text and\ntables, while Troland seemed to think that honour would be satisfied\nwith no more than 605 trials\u2014say ten hours' work\u2014and 26 pages of\nprint.\nHis technique was very different from that of Coover. Instead of\nusing cards or Lotto blocks, he devised a special apparatus in which\nthe agent peered into a kind of box at the back of which was arranged\na permanent bright spot of fight, or \" fixation point \", to the right\nor left of which an illuminated patch was caused to appear from time\nto time by means of an independent mechanical device. The per-\ncipient's business was to indicate\u2014also by means of a mechanical\n\fDecembee 1938 Evidence for Extra-Sensory Perception 297\narrangement\u2014whether he had the impression that the patch was\non the right or the left. Elaborate precautions, probably quite\nadequate, were taken to prevent the percipient getting any clue by\nnormal means as to which was the case, while the alternation of right\nand left was secured by means of a specially designed \" stimulus\nshuffler \" intended to give a truly random series of the two stimuh.\nThe results showed an appreciable, but not significant, tendency\nto score too low ;\nactually, 284 successes were recorded against a true\nexpectation of 300 which would occur by chance about as often as\nonce in six such experiments, but the deficit was confined entirely to\none category of trial, namely that in which the impression period was\n15 seconds, whereas the other category Math a 30-second period\nshows a shght excess of right guesses. The deficiency of 21 successes\nbelow expectation in the short period category was intrinsically\nsignificant, to the extent of less than one chance in 36, while the\ncontrast between the two categories would only occur by chance\nabout once in twenty such experiments.\nThese facts alone were sufficient to make it fairly clear that some\nnon-chance factor was at work, but they were further supported by\nthe very well-marked tendency for the degree of success to deteriorate\nas from the earlier sittings to the later. This gave odds better than\n50 to 1 for the two percipients who were involved taken together\nand better than 100 to 1 for Dr Troland himself alone. Thus,\nwhichever way we took the data, there was at worst a very honest\n50 to 1 chance against their being a fortuitous product.\nWe had then in this case an investigator, who was evidently\nheavily biassed against finding anything suggestive of non-normal\neffects, taking every precaution that ingenuity could devise against\nthe operation of sensory cues, yet bringing off, so to say, a fifty to\none shot as a result of so trifling a sample as six himdred trials.\nMr Carington then referred to the work of Dr Estabrooks carried\nout at Harvard in 1925-26, which appeared to have been of good\nquahty and had certainly provided some extremely interesting\nresults.\nDr Estabrooks worked with college students guessing ordinary\nplaying cards and, for the purposes of this discussion, his experi-\nments might be divided into two groups.\nIn the first which was made up of 83 sets of 20 guesses each,\nagents and percipients were in the two halves of a double room\nseparated by double closed doors. Dr Estabrooks said that the\ninner room, which the percipient occupied, was \" relatively sound-\nproof \", but added that \" noises such as the scraping of a chair, or\nloud talking, can ... be distinctly heard between the two rooms\n\"\n\f298 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Decbmbeb 1938\nand lie \" does not wish in any way to stress tlie point of these rooms\nbeing insulated from each other as regards sound \". Still, it did\nnot seem very likely that, in such an experiment, either Dr Esta-\nbrooks or the other agents who from time to time assisted him\nwould enunciate the names of the cards sufficiently loudly to be heard\nthrough the doors. An electrical signalling device was used to in-\nstruct the percipient when to record a guess, and Dr Estabrooks\nseemed to have been keenly alive to the necessity of making sure\nthat these signals could not form the basis of an imconscious code\nfrom which the percipient could deduce the nature of the card.\nThe results of this group of experiments were overwhelmingly\npositive. In 1,660 trials, 938 guesses were correct as to colour\nagainst an expectation of 830\u2014a result which would occur by chance\nonly about once in every ten milhon such experiments. The degree\nof success in guessing the suit\u2014which, of course, meant the colour\nalso\u2014was not quite so spectacular, but still a good deal better\nthan was needed to give odds of 100 to 1 against chance. The first\nten cards always gave better results than the second ten, which to\nsome extent militated against the hypothesis of normal leakage.\nMr Carington said he would pass on to the fourth series which\nproduced very much more interesting figures. This series consisted\nof 32 rims of 20 guesses each, and the important point was that, in\nthis case, agents and percipients were m rooms about 60 feet apart,\nwith four closed doors between them. He thought we might safely\ntake it that sensory cues were effectively excluded under these\nconditions.\nThe results were described as \" wholly negative \", but this was\nmisleading. Some of the scores were significantly below chance\n;\nand this was a convenient point to discuss what the appearance of\nbelow-chance scores involved. In time past it had commonly but\nerroneously been supposed that such scores are merely \" negative \",\nin the sense that they indicated no more than a failure to cognize\nthe card or other object by non-normal means, or at most that they\nindicated an \" inhibition \" of the cognitive ability concerned. This\nwas not the case. The appearance of a significant below-chance\nscore indicated the operation of some non-chance factor just as\nemphatically as did an equal above-chance score ; the only question\nwas that of the nature of the factor so indicated.\nThe explanation, which applied to any mode of cognition, normal\nor non-normal, was straightforward enough once it was pointed out.\nIt was simply this : that if, for whatever reason, first thoughts are\nright, then second thoughts must be wrong. If, by whatever means,\nhe (Mr Carington) correctly obtained the impression that the card\n\fDecember 1938 Evidence for Extra-Sensory Perception\nhe was required to guess was, say, the King of Hearts, and then\nhesitated, changed his mind, and wrote down something else, his\nfinal guess must inevitably be wrong. Thus, a significant below-\nchance score might result from the combmation of correct un-\npressions with lack of confidence. The source of the impressions\nwas not relevant to the issue, though they must obviously be\nof a sufiiciently faint or vague character to admit of doubt. It\nfollowed that the appearance of a significant below-chance score, as\nin that case, did not enable us to exclude sensory cues imperfectly\npicked up ; but it did virtually enable us to exclude fraud. We\nwere left with the alternative of supposing that, despite a distance\nof 60 feet and four closed doors, sensory cues were yet operative\nto a significant extent.\nThe possibihty of biassed guessing on the part of the percipients\ncorresponding to biassed selection of the cards seemed to have been\neffectively excluded by Dr Estabrooks having scored each guess, as\na check, against the card drawn five places later ;\nand he also seemed\nto have examined carefully the general composition of the selected\ncards and the manner m which the different colours and suits\nfollowed one another.\nMr Carington said he would be sorry to say that this case proved\nanything more than that some sort of non-chance factor was\noperative ; at the same time, it did seem quite unusually difficult\nto attribute the results to any of the ordmary causes, so that it\nappeared to offer correspondingly strong prima facie evidence m\nfavour of whatever it was that we referred to when we spoke of\nE.S.P.\nHe then proceeded to discuss a case, which he said was unique m\nthe annals of Psychical Research ;\nthe experiments on \" wilUng\n\"\ncarried out at Groningen in the summer of 1919 by the late Professor\nHeymans, Dr (now Professor) Brugmans, and Dr Wynberg. So far\nas he was aware, there was no adequate account of these experiments\navailable in Enghsh ; his own account was based on earher accounts\nm Dutch, German and French, supplemented by a special pilgrunage\nto Groningen in November 1937.\nOnly one percipient, a student of the University of Groningen\nnamed van Dam, was tested. This gentleman had shown a remark-\nable abihty for reproducing in private the pubhc performances of the\nwell-known professional Rubini, and the experiments were devised\nwith the object of enabhng this ability to be studied m a quantitative\nmanner imder substantially test conditions.\nThe subject was always blindfolded, was seated in a kind of three-\nsided box, open only at the rear, and in addition was screened by\n\fJournal of Society for Psychical Research December 1938\ncurtains from any considerable vision of the room in which he sat.\nActually, these precautions were not relevant to the essential\nissues involved, but were mentioned for the sake of completeness.\nIn front of hun was a rectangular board, measuring about 16 in.\nby 12 in., divided into 48 squares of about 2 in. side, arranged in\nsix roAvs and eight columns. The columns were lettered from A to\nH, and the rows numbered from 1 to 6. The task of the percipient\nwas not to guess one of these numbers in the ordinary sense, but to\nindicate by pointing which of them had been selected by the experi-\nmenter. The process of selection was by drawing one each of eight\nlettered and six numbered cards provided for the purpose, which\nwere shuffled before each trial.\nIt was obvious that the a priori chance of success was 1 in 48 ;\nthat was to say, if nothuag but chance were at work, we should -\nexpect an average of one success in about 48 trials. Actually, there\nwere 60 successes in the rather small number of 187 trials\u2014a result\nwhich led to odds of the hyper-astronomical order against the\noperation of chance alone.\nAbout half the trials were conducted with the experimenters in the\nsame room as the subject, and the remainder with them in the room\nabove, from which they observed through a doubly glazed opening\ncut in the floor. In the latter case it was a matter of no importance\nwhether the subject could see the board or not, for seeing it would not\ntell him what letter and number had been drawn ; the trials in two\nrooms wwe slightly more successful than those in one and, by them-\nselves, showed results of fantastic significance.\nIt was well to consider with some particularity what took place\nin the course of these two-room trials. The subject was seated in\nthe lower room with the squared board in front of him. In the upper\nroom were the experimenters, of whom at least two were always\npresent. One of these\u2014the \" leader \", as he was termed\u2014drew a\nlettered card and a numbered card\u2014say G and 4\u2014and, looking\nthrough the doubly glazed hole, \" willed \" the subject to move his\nhand to the selected square, G4, m row 4 and column G. The signal\nfor the subject to start his search was given by striking on the floor\nwith a hammer, for the double glazing of the hole precluded verbal\ninstruction ;\nand when the subject felt that he was \" on the spot\n\"\nhe signalled by tapping twice with his middle finger on the chosen\narea.\nIt was certain, humanly speaking, that the subject had no means\nof knowing in any normal fashion which cards had been drawn\n\u2014\nthat is to say, which square had been chosen. Certainly he could\nnot see them, even if the bhndfolding, the box and the curtains were\n\fDecember 1938 Evidence for Extra-Sensory Perception\nineffective ;\nit was quite incredible that subconscious whispering\nby the \" leader\n\"\u2014which must have been so faint as to escape the\nnotice of the other experunenters\u2014should be audible to the subject\nthrough a doubly glazed hole, sound-proof enough to prevent verbal\ncommunication of any ordinary kind.\nAs against this, two glaruigly obvious sources of error presented\nthemselves to anyone famihar with this type of work. In the first\nplace, the assumption that the true chance of success was 1 in 48 is\nextremely dangerous, for it depended on the prior assumptions that\neither the subject's movements or the drawing of the cards, or both,\nwere truly random ; and both these were contrary to experience.\nThe subject was clearly more hkely either naturally to favour, or\nperhaps conscientiously to avoid, the area of the board within\neasiest range of his hand ; while imphcit rehance on theoretical\nexpectation was unlikely to be justified in practice, as regards\nshufiled cards m such small numbers.\nIn the second place there was the possibihty of the experimenter\nunwittingly giving a \" STOP! \" signal, when the subject's finger\nreached the right place. Even with experimenters in a different\nroom, changes of position, or shifting of weight on a sufficiently\ncreaky floor, would be all that would be necessary for the required\neffect.\nIt was with these two points chiefly in mind that he had visited\nGroningen last November ; he fully expected to find either that\nthe true expectation of success, owing to preferential movements\nof the subject and drawing of the cards, had been far in excess of the\ntheoretical, or else that the experiments had been conducted in\nhghtly constructed buildings favouring the transmission of unwitting\n\" Stop \" signals of the type suggested.\nThrough the great courtesy of Professor Brugmans, he was per-\nmitted not only to view the scene of the experiments, but also to\nwork through all the original note-books and thus to compute the\ntrue expectation of success from the actual data. To summarise\nthe outcome of his investigation in a few words, he found that the\ntrue expectation of success was neghgibly different from the theoreti-\ncal, while the floor dividing the two rooms was of a most uncom-\npromisiag sohdity.\nThe upper room was on the ground floor, and the lower in a sort\nof half-basement, of one of the main University buildings. The\nseparating floor was of manifestly stout construction\u2014something\nlike inch planks, laid on 9 or 10-inch joists spaced at about 14 inches,\nbetween two of which the observation hole had been cut, and with at\nleast lath and plaster on the under side. At the time of the experi-\n\f302 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1938\nment the planking was bare, but \" a thick mat \" was provided for\nthe \" leader \" to stand on\u2014a circumstance which suggests that the\npossibihty of auditory cues being transmitted to the subject was not\noverlooked. He had carefully discussed the possibility of \" Stop\nsignals \" with Prof. Brugmans who remained convinced that\nnothing of the kind could have occurred. Moreover, the internal\nevidence offered very strong evidence against the \" Stop signal\n\"\nhypothesis.\nIn about one-sixth of the trials, the subject was given a dose of\nalcohol before the session : under these conditions he scored no less\nthan 22 successes in 29 trials. This gives prodigious odds against\nchance ; but so, of course, does the experiment as a whole, and also\nthe trials in which nothing was given. The interesting point was\nthat the \" alcoholic \" trials were very significantly more successful\nthan the ordinary\u2014to the tune of about ten million to one against\nchance. In order to maintain the \" Stop signal \" hypothesis,\ntherefore, we must suppose not only that unwitting signals were\ngiven, but that they were given more often, or more effectively,\nwhen alcohohc trials were in progress than when they were not\n;\nor else that the effect of alcohol was greatly to lower the subject's\nauditory threshold, not a usual effect of the drug.\nAnother 24 trials were conducted with the subject under the\ninfluence of bromide, and these, though significantly less successful\nthan those with alcohol (about 30 to 1), were significantly more so\nthan those in which nothing was given at all (about 78 to 1). Thus\nwe are forced to suppose that the unwitting signals were graded to a\nsignificant extent as between ordinary occasions, bromide occasions\nand alcohol occasions. Mr Carington thought that the experiments,\nthough not conclusive, afforded very strong prima facie evidence\nin favour of the operation of some non-normal cause.\nThe last piece of work to be discussed was that of Usher and Burt\ncarried out in 1907 and pubhshed in the Annates des Sciences\nPsychiques for 1910. This work, though old, had features which\nmade it of remarkable interest ; on the whole it was, perhaps, the\nmost convincing case he knew.\nIts importance lay in the fact that agent and percipient were not\nmerely in two different rooms, or even in two different buildings,\nbut in two different towns ; in one set of trials London and Bristol,\nin another London and Prague. This circumstance relieved us of the\nnecessity of worrying about the possibihty of \" leakage \" through\nnormal sensory channels and allowed us to concentrate on other\nfactors in the situation. The investigators were chiefly interested\nin the transmission of diagrams, but they did a certain number of\n\fDecember 1938 Evidence for Extra-8ensory Perception 303\ntrials with playing cards of which full results for thirty trials, on\nsix days, between London and Bristol, were given. Among these\nthirty trials there was only one complete success ; or two if an alter-\nnative guess on the seventh trial was admitted.\nTwo successes in thirty trials was not exciting, but a very different\nstate of affairs was revealed when we took the partial successes into\naccount by applying Prof. Fisher's method of scoring. This was\nfirst done, as regards the first 25 guesses, by Mr Soal in the preamble\nto his well-known report on Experiments in Supernormal Percep-\ntion, in Proc. XL. He gave odds of about 33 to 1 against chance\nfor these, and dismissed the result as \" suggestive, but of course,\nnot conclusive \" ; but this was evidently partly due to a lapsus\ncalami, for his own figures indicated a better than 50 to 1 probabihty.\nMoreover, the last 5 guesses were above-average successful ; so Mr\nCarington thought it worth while to re-open the question with a fresh\nanalysis. In doing this he had credited each double guess with the\nmean score of its two components, and had omitted altogether one\nattempt in which \" no guess \" was recorded. He obtained a mean\nvalue of 17-29 points per guess, against 11-18 expected, and the\nprobability of this occiixring by chance alone was only 1 in 459.\nMoreover, there was a very marked tendency for the degree of suc-\ncess to fall off with time ; the probability of this being due to chance\nwas no more than 1 in 544. Finally, there was a perceptible, but\nnot intrinsically significant, upward twist, so to say, of the scores\nat the end ; this might occur so often as once in eight such experi-\nments as a result of chance alone.\nCombining these figures, he found that the overall chance of the\nfigures being fortuitous was less than 1 in 11,000.\nThe expermienters themselves were principally interested in\nthe transmission of diagrams, and in their paper they reproduced\n47 pairs of drawings\u2014one by the agent, and one by the percipient\npurporting to correspond therewith, in each case. All these were\nlong-distance trials\u2014between London and Bristol, and between\nLondon and Prague. The question was whether there is more\ncorrespondence between them than chance alone was hkely to give ;\nwhether the percipients' reproductions were, on the whole, signi-\nficantly more like the diagrams they were intended to resemble than\nthey were like those they were not intended to resemble.\nThis question was not very easy to answer, but he had devised a\nplan which seemed to him satisfactory, and Mr Herbert had recently\nbeen putting it into practice. The procedure was as follows.\nBoth series of drawings\u2014that is to say, the series of originals\nand the series of would-be reproductions\u2014were given randomised\n\f304 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1938\ncode numbers. Then pairs of pairs were again drawn at random,\nso as to obtain sets of four drawings eacli consisting of two originals\nand the two corresponding attempts at reproduction. These were\nsubmitted to a judge, who was asked to indicate which reproduction\nhe thought belonged to which original. He knew, of pourse, which\nwere the originals and which the reproductions, but not which of the\nlatter was intended for which of the former. Thus, if there were no\nintrinsic similarity to guide him, he would be as likely to match them\nwrongly as rightly ; so that we should expect, on the average, to\nfind that half the sets of four were correctly paired off and the other\nhalf incorrectly. So far, 11 judges had tried their skill, with the\nresult that 9 correctly matched more than 50 per cent, of the sets,\nand 2 less ; the total judgments showed 144 correct and 105 in-\ncorrect. Thus there was a distinct tendency for drawings to be\ncorrectly allocated more often than considerations of chance would\nindicate ;\nthe probabilities are about 1 in 37 if we reckon by judges\nand better than 1 in 50 if we reckon by total points.\nThe method seemed a promising way of dealing with otherwise\ninassessable material, and the outcome in this case served, so far as\nit went, to support the view that some kind of non-normal cognition\nwas operative.\nBut the card results were quite capable of standing alone ; odds\nof 11,000 to 1 would not be overset even by the complete failure of a\ndifferent type of experiment. There was no doubt of the results\nbeing positive ;\nthere could be no question of sensory cues ; it\nwould be ridiculous to attribute the figures obtained to chance ;\nand he did not see how even the most intransigeant critic could\nsuggest that the experimenters carefully faked their results in such\na way that the effects could only be revealed by a technique which\nwas not invented till some seventeen years later.\nIt would be prudent to sum up on a note of mingled warning and\nencouragement. He had tried to show that a careful study of certain\npublished experiments indicated without any doubt at all that\ncauses other than chance were operative. That was not the same\nas to conclude that they were due to some paranormal faculty of\ntranscendental significance. To cite a classical example, the late\nProf. Karl Pearson concluded from a study of certain figures pub-\nlished in the journal Monaco that \" roulette as played at Monte\nCarlo is not a game of chance \". This was a complete non sequitur,\nnot because his methods were faulty or his calculations inaccurate,\nbut because he permitted himself the somewhat naive assumption\nthat the published figures correctly represented the sequence of\nevents at the table.\n\fDecember 1938 Evidence for Extra-Sensory Perception 305\nIn the same way, when evidently non-chance results in guessing\ncards or the like were presented to us, the proper initial inference\nwas rather that the percipient was after all, able to obtain informa-\ntion by normal means, than that he was capable of seeing through\nthe back of a card. It was only when the possibihty of obtaining\ninformation normally had been definitely excluded, or when the\nresults were of a nature unlikely to be produced even if there were\nleakage of this kind, that we are entitled even to suggest \" para-\nnormal \" explanations.\nIt was for these reasons that he had eschewed all sjDectacular and\npatently unreliable work, ancient and modern ahke, and had dealt\nalmost exclusively with stones that the builders had rejected as not\nconforming to their preconceived design. The result, it seemed to\nhim, was a body of evidence which, if not completely coercive, at\nleast established an incontrovertible case for further and more\nmeticulous uivestigation.\nREVIEW\nGhosts and ApjMritions. By W. H. Salter. Bell (\" Psychical\nExperiences \" Series). 3s. 6d.\n\" Ghost as Mr Salter observes in his Introduction, is not \" a\nterm of art in psychical research \". The meaning of the word has\nno proper boundaries. Dr Godwin Baynes confines it with some\nsuccess to productions, possibly veridical, of the collective uncon-\nscious. In the public mind, which this series should do something\nto enlighten, the ghost is something to \" believe in \" or not\u2014m the\nlatter case, something to disbelieve in without prejudice to a\nChristmas appetite for ghost stories. This is, after all, a foundation\nupon which to base an attitude of critical interest.\nGhosts and apparitions, as a popular grouping of phenomena that\nattract wide interest and a higher standard of dramatic narration\nthan of fidelity to observed fact, furnish a special opportunity to\nthe promoter of sound discrimination in psychical matters, and Mr\nSalter's collection of cases has risen to the occasion with threefold\neffect. The cases reflect, of course, the standards of authenticity\nand attestation which the Society has always maintained ;\nthey\nform a particularly interesting selection ; and they appear to cover\nevery important area in an irregular and heterogeneous field. This\nlast point has especial significance, for the best corrective of naive\nideas about the natural or supernatural origin of apparitions and\nhauntings is not argument, which is easily forgotten, but the realisa-\n\f306 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.
