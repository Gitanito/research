Are' Magnctical Somnambuli\u017fm phocnomena of \u017fuch\nan importance as to de\u017ferve the curio\u017fity of both the public\nand the learned? _\nThe object of this que\ufb05ion is, Ibclieve, very plain and\nobvious; l mean to \u017fay, that previou\u017fly to our being at the\ntrouble of examining whether Magnetical Somnambnli\u017fm\nbe an illu\u017fion, or reality, we mu\ufb05 e\ufb05abli\u017fh, that, there\n\\ \u017f\u017f _ _ - , exi\ufb05,\nr'- A deeree o\u017fthe Fac'dtv o\u017fParis, 1794, which is the \u017fame-As they\n\ufb02il for inoculation, which is now adopted by them.\n4\n\f(3)\n-cxi\ufb05, at lea\ufb05 \u017feemingly, \u017fome \u017fingularities which concern\nboth the public good and the improvement of learning.\nMany people, however, might have a right to doubt it,\nbecau\u017fe they had no occa\u017fion to know the truth of the a\u017f\u017fer\ntion. They have a &ht to require to be \u017fatis\ufb01ed, previ- \u017f\u017f\noully to the di\u017fcu\u017f\u017fion o\u017f the two following propo\u017fitions, viz.\nU That there are either at Paris, Dublin, Scc in the provin\n\u00fe (5 ces, or any where el\u017fe \u017fome people, who being naturallyv\n\" forced into a \ufb05ate of \u017fleep, really o\u017f\u017fer the phoenomena\n'5 which we are about to examine.\"\nFor if it was not certain that \u017fuch a \u017fcene is not to be\nmet with \u017fomewhere, - it would be a lo\u017fs of time to enquire\ninto its principle. '\nIt is, therefore, a preliminary obligation for any body\nel\u017fe, to e\ufb05abli\u017fh well the exi\ufb05ence of Magnetical Somnam\nbuli\u017fm, whether right or wrong.\nThis point was, for a long time, a matter of general\nincredulity. They plainly denied that there were any \u017fuch\nindividuals exi\ufb05ing any where, and the very di\u017fcour\u017fe held\non the \u017fubject, was looked upon merely asa fable to amu\u017fe\nthe pub'lic. -\nThe \ufb01r\ufb05 writing, which treated of Magnetical Somnam\nbnli\ufb05s, was, i\u017f I am not mi\ufb05aken, aletter from Mr. Cloquet,\npayma\ufb05er of rents at Soi\u017f\u017fons, who, relating what helhad\n\u017feen at Buzanci's treatment, by the Marquis de Puy\u017fegur,\nin\u017finuated \u017fomething which \u017feemed to characteri\u017fe Magne\ntical Somnamhuli\u017fm. '\nSince that letter, a gentleman, who\u017fe candor is above al\u017f\n\u017fu\u017fpicion, has con\u017figned in a writing, which is, in every'\nre\u017fpect, intere\ufb05ing, \u017feveral phoenomena he had ob\u017ferved in\nMzocnci's treatment, \ufb05illu more wonderful than tho\u017fe which\nCloquet had given a \u017fketch of. - ct\nThe peru\u017fal of this performance having in\u017fpired \u017fome'\npeople o\u00fef the_\ufb01r\ufb05 rank with the eager de\u017fire of being wit\nne\u017f\u017fes like Somnambuli\u017fm, the author of the above \u017found'\nan opportunity of gratifying their curio\u017fity at Paris, in the .\nwinter of 1785. _ _\nMore than 5000 people' have been at liberty to \u017fee tho\u017fe\nphoenomena true or fal\u017fe, of which notice was taken both\nin the national and foreign prints. The\u017fe Somnambules un\n, derwent repeated trials, which all met with more or le\u017fs\n\u017fucce\u017fs. \u00fe\n, Be\u017fide:\n\f. ( 9 )\n_ Be\u017fides tho\u017fe mentioned, many more were madeat Paris,\nBr in \u017fome other provinces. This Somnambuli\u017fm example\nhaving' induced the Magneti\u017fers to adhere to that part of\nhiagneti\u017fm, they applied them\u017felves to it _with more zeal;\nas it \u017feemed to be a \u017fure way towards a remedy. Thus, the\nconcern of Magneti\u017fm, and that of the'patient, uniting\nboth to pre\u017fcribe that mode of proceeding, it is become the\ncommon object of all Magneti\u017fers attempts, and in all\ntreatmentthey gloried 'in \u017fhewing \u017fome patient more or le\u017fs\nimproved. , . '\nIt is evident then that there exi\ufb05s many individuals\n'\ufb05ruck with a \u017feeming Sor'nnambuli\u017fm ; and I begin to e\ufb05ah -\nbli\u017fh the que\ufb05ion, in order' to proceed methodically, after\n\u017fettling-con\ufb05ant and notorious facts, which might lead to\ninfallible con\u017fequences. '\nIt is then certain and indi\u017fputable, that there are pre\n'tended Somnambules, which o\ufb00er wonderful phoenomena\nto the \u017fpectators, as eompen\u017fative grati\u017fication for excited\ncurio\u017fity. _ , 7 _ , .\nNow, the' que\ufb05ion is to know what opinion we \u017fhould\nform concerning tho\u017fe Somnarnbules ;' _if it be not afeigned\n\u017ftate, by the vmeans of which they endeavour to impo\u017fe on\nthe credulity of tho\u017fe whom they are \u017furrounded by.\nad. How far are Magnetical Semnambules to\u017f\u017f'be bete _\nlieved ?\nAmong the Somnambules I'am here \u017fpeaking of, I do\nnot include that multitude of per\u017fons of both \u017fexes among\n\"the common people, -w :0 are to be\u017fi'en at\u017fhme impg\ufb05orr, and\nmay rea\u017fonably be \u017fu\u017fpected to perform Somnambuli\u017fm,\nthrough imitation, or to make them\u017felves intere\ufb05ing, and\nothers who are paid for it. . '\nIt is a misfortune, con\ufb05antly attending on good things,\nthat they can never be pre\u017ferved in their native purity, nor\ne\u017fcape that mixture which malice' or cupidity \u017feldom fail to\nblcnd with them. '\nTho\u017fe who, either through prejudice or intere\ufb05, endea- \\\nvour to di\u017fplay the di\u017fcovery, take care to examine it on that\n\u017fide only, which \u017feems to convey an idea of a parent '\nquackery, and never fail to Pre\u017fent it to the publicv in that\nview, ' '\nBut tho\u017fe who \u017fincerely wi\u017fh for information, pay but\nlittle regard 'to \u017fuch a con\u017fideration\u017fan'd throwing a\u017fide\n'quackery and exaggerations, carefully penetrate as far as the\nB principle\n'\n\fire)\nprinciple it\u017felf. Thus, a botani\ufb05, de\u017firous of procuring\nthe fruit of an Almond to be enabled to, di\u017fcern its true\nquality, is not di\u017fcouraged by the putrid \ufb02e\u017fh which \u017fur\nJrounds it ; but chearfully lopping all nau\u017feous \u017fuper\ufb02uities,\nhe \ufb01nds at la\ufb05 the fruit which is to be the rule of his\n\ufb05ud . ' .\nIri that manner \u017fhould every unbia\u017f\u017frd man act, who\n\u017fincerely \u017feeks for truth, without having intere\ufb05\/or de\u017fign to\nde\ufb05roy it.\nLet us contemptuou\u017fly di\u017fregard tho\u017fe \u017fu\u017fpicious apparent\nSomnambules, and attend to tho\u017fe who, by their civil exi\ufb05p\nence, their? character, manner, &e. are above \u017fu\u017fpicion;\nand in whom, be\u017fides Somnambuli\u017fm, the \u017fcience\\ is por\ntrayed, and brought to the highe\ufb05 degree of perfection.\nI think tho\u017fe ought to be cho\u017fen among patients, in whom\nSomnambuli\u017fm appears to be in a higher degree of er\u017fecz\ntion, and \u017fuch a caution is, in my opinion, very ma erial.\n' 'In fact, the more imperfect the Somnambulc is, the ea\u017fier\nvit is toimpo\u017fe; if he badly an\u017fwers your \u017figns, and follows\n' your motions in an untoward and ill contrived manner, he\nXapolog'izes by \u017faying he is not, as yet, arrived to a \ufb05ate of\n\/per\u017fect Somiiainbuli\u017fm, and the ob\u017fervator, who reall\n__cQnceives that \u017fuch a \ufb05ate mu\ufb05 have its degrees, is puzzledz\non account of his not knowing whether the bad \u017fucce\u017fs he\n[has experienced is to be attributed to the untowardne\u017fs o\u017f\u017ff\nthe Somnamhule, or the imper\u017fection of his \ufb05ate.\nBut whenI \u017fix on a Somnambule, recommended as a\nperfect being, it is evident that this ta\u017fk is very painful.
