There were also present at one or both of the,\nMeetings, Dr. A. T. Myers and Messrs. F. W. H. Myers, Frank\nPodmore, H. Arthur Smith, and J. Herbert Stack.\nSeven new Members and eighteen new Associates were elected,\nwhose names and addresses appear in the preceding page.\nThe thanks of the Council were accorded to Mr. Myers for a dona-\ntion of \u00a35 to the funds of the Society.\nSome presents to the Library were reported, for which a vote of\nthanks was passed to the donors.\nIt was agreed that the Annual Business Meeting of the Members\nof the Society should be held on }'riday, the 31st of January, 1890; a\nGeneral Meeting and a Meeting of the Council to be held on the same\nday. The exact arrangements as to the hour of each Meeting will b&\ndetermined later.\nVarious other matters of routine business were attended to.\nThe next Meeting of the Council was fixed for Friday, the 29th of\nNovember, 4.30 p.m., a General Meeting to be held the same evening\nat 8.30 as previously arranged.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nA General Meeting was held at the Westminster Town Hall on\nFriday, October 25th, at four o'clock. The President, Professor\nSidgwick, was in the chair, and over 170 persons-Members and their\nfriends-were present.\nThe PRESIDENT gave some account of the International Congress\nof Experimental Psychology, which met at Paris in August, and which\nhe and Mr. Myers, and other Members of the Society had attended.\nHe commented on the success of the meeting and its agreeable\ncharacter, largely due to the tact and good management of its secretary.\nour Corresponding Member, Professor Richet. He said that he had\nbeen impressed with the amount of interest taken by the Congress in\nthe investigations ,of our Society, and mentioned that at the next meet.\ning of the Congress-to be held in England, in August, 1892-repre-\nsentatives of the Society for Psychical Research would join with other\nDigitized by Google\n\f,Nov., 1889.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 155\nexperimental psychologists, not belonging to our Society, in forming a\nCommittee of Reception for the Congress.\nThe President went on to say that the main subject of discussion by\nthe Congress had been hypnotism in its psychological aspects. He\nhad gathered from the discussion that the long-continued controversy\nbetween the school of the Salp~triere and that of Nancy was now falling\ninto a subordinate place; there seemed to be a general disposition to\nadmit a wide range of susceptibility to hypnotism in some degree; nor\nwas there any substantial disagreement as to the fundamental\nimportance of the part played by suggestion in producing hypnotic\nphenomena. On the other hand, even if suggestion would accouut\nfor all modes of producing the hypnotic state, it would not by itself\naccount for all the phenomena sometimes observed in that state. And\nin saying this he was not thinking only of telepathy and possible\nclairvoyance, but of hyperresthesia, increased influence of mind on body,\nand other phenomena, more readily admitted than telepathy by orthodox\nphysiologists and psychologists. .\nLeaving this topic, he went on to say that perhaps the most impor-\ntant part of the proceedings of the Congress, from the point of view of\nthe Society for Psychical Research, was that they had taken up the\nstatistical investigation into the nature and frequency of hallucination\nof the senses already begun by us. This would not only make the\ninquiry more fruitful by increasing its range, but must lead to a more\ngeneral acceptance among scientific men of our view that certain\nhallucinations are veridical or truth-telling, if that view be true; or if\nthe view be mistaken, it would probably bring that fact unmistakably\nto light.\nIn conclusion, Professor Sidgwick repeated his appeal for more\nassistance in collecting these statistics. Up to the present time,\nas the result of six months' work, about 3000 answers had been\nreceived. At the present rate, therefore, we should have 18,000 or\n20,000 to report on when the Congress meets in 1892. But we ought\nnot to aim at less than 50,000, so t.hat the need of redoubled effort was\nevident.\nMR. MYERS then read part of a paper by Miss X., the author of the\naccount of experiments in crystal vision published in Proceedings,\nVol. V. The present paper, which will, it is hoped, be published in the\nProceedings in April or May next year, is mainly concerned with\nrecords of various telepathic experiences between Miss X. and some of\nher friends. These ladies had kept diaries in which they recorded,\nwithout of course any normal communication with each other, any\ncase in which they had at the time the impression that some telepathic\ncommunication had passed between them. It was understood that\nDigitized by Google\n\f156 JoWl\"fWl of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1889.\nevery case so recorded was to count as a success if it corresponded with\nthe other person's diary, and as a failure if it did not correspond, and\nthat no experience was to count, however striking the apparent coinci-\ndence might afterward seem, which was not so recorded. These diaries\nhad been kept for nearly two years and contained nearly 100 entries.\nMost of these were of course very trivial, but only two of them could be\ncounted as failures.\nThe PRESIDENT wished to express the sense of obligation we were\nunder to the ladies who had taken the pains to keep these diaries.\nEver since the Society had been formed, and, indeed, long before that,\nhe had constantly urged on persons who believed that they frequently\nhad psychical intimations of present or future events to keep a diary in\nwhich every such impression should be recorded at the time and before\nthe truth or falsehood of it was known. Only in this way could it be\nsatisfactorily proved that the failures had not been overlooked and that\nthe coincidences were beyond chance.\nA GENTLEMAN inquired whether any characteristics could be named\nwhich would indicate that a person had the power of seeing visions in\ncrystals.\nMR. MYERS replied that we had as yet had far too little opportunity\nof observing such persons to be able to generalise. It was all the more\nimportant that all should try. He had himself begun to form a theory\nthat persons who had in a high degree the power of visualising in\nimagination were likely to succeed, but he had had to abandon this\ntheory as he had recently met a lady who could more easily see visions\nin crystal than anyone he knew though she was a bad visualiser.\nMR. HANSEN mentioned a curious instance of seeing visions in a\nflat looking glass, looked at almost edgeways, which he had met with in\nRussia. He also related an apparently telepathic experience of his own.\nHe was walking in a street which branched on two sides of a church.\nOn reaching the church he walked along one side of it, and as he did\nso became aware that a gentleman he wished to speak to was walking\nalong the other side in the opposite direction. He turned back and\nmet the gentleman at the junction of the roads in front of the church,\nand found that he was on his way to seek him. Afterwards it occurred\nto him to wonder how he had known that this gentleman was at the\nother side of the church, and he supposed that the windows of the\nchurch must be near the ground, and that he had seen through two\nopposite windows. On investigation, however, this proved not to be\nthe case. He could not possibly have seen him, unless he had had the\npower of seeing through two stonewalls.\nThe Meeting then assumed a conversational character.\nDigitized by Google\n\fNov., 1889.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 157\nCASES RECEIVED BY THE LITERARY OOMMITTEE.\nIt will be remembered that we gave (in the JOU'l\"TltaZ for November,\n1888, Vol. III., pp. 333-336), some interesting cases of apparent\nclairvoyance, sent to us by Mr. A. W. Dobbie, of Rothesay Villa,\nCollege Park, South Australia, and that part of a letter from Mr.\nDobbie about these was printed in the JOU'l\"TltaZ for March, 1889, in\nwhich reference was made to a letter of March, 1886, which had been\nlost. Mr. Dobbie has now sent us a copy of this lost letter and enclos-\nures, the greater part of which we print below. It contains, as will\nbe seen, accounts of four incidents. The last of these is the most\nimportant, and is considered by Mr. Dobbie to be one of the most\nremarkable cases he has ever had, on account of the exclusion of the\npossibility of thought-transference. See Journal, Vol. IV., p. 37.) Un-\nfortunately he considered success to be so improbable that, contrary to\nhis usual practice, he did not note down the words of the clairvoyant\nat the time. (See JOUTrUII, Vol. III., p. 336.) We have, however, Mr.\nAdamson's recollection to confirm his own.\nWhen conducting experiments on thiot subject (which I have now been\ndoing once a week for the past 12 months), I always have my note-book and\npencil in my lap and endeavour to take down the words of my clairvoyant as\nnear verbatim as possible.\nI generally have two, and sometimes three clairvoyants to experiml'nt\nupon at the same time, because I find it is advisable to allow intervals of\nrest during the evening, so whilst I am engaged with one the others are\nquietly sleeping.\nMy clairvoyants have been mostly ladies; but that is simply because it\nis more easy to obtain ladies as subjects. One of my bl'st and most regular\nclairvoyants iot a young mall of about 24 years of age.\nA very important feature in connection with c1airyoyant eXpt'riments is\nhe fact that cases which can be accepted as scientific proof of the reality of\nclairvoyance are very rare indeed. It ill quite the common thing for my\nexperiments to produce unbounded astonishment and delight in the minds of\n.the spectators (there are always from two to twelve persons); but they are of\na nature that I cannot accept as being certain that they are literally correct.\nTo illustrate what I mean, I will quote from my note-book an extract of a\ncase which occurred 011 the evening of January 1st, ]886. I should first\nstate that my clairvoyants never have the slightest idea as to what I place\nin their hauds for diagnosis, and that their eyes are uot only closed in\nsleep, but are turned over, so that only the white is visible when the eyelids\nare separated by force; and further, that a needle may be forced into any\npart of their body without their beiug in the least disturbed.\nMCI. 8\nI placed in the hand of my clairvoyant a tooth which I had taken from\nDigitized by Google\n\f158 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1889.\nthe skull of an Australian native (of the history of which I knew nothing)\nand in about two minutes she began: \"I see a river, a wild place, I like it\nhere, it is a nice place, lots of nice trees and green grass, more gum trees\ntban anything else\" (for the information of English readers I may mention\nthat what the oak is in England, the gum tree is in Australia),. \"but there\nare other trees also, there is one something like a pine tree.\"\nHere she suddenly started and said, \"Oh, what is that 1 it is a snake, it\nis pretty, coloured like a carpet\" (I may mention that carpet snakes are\nplentiful in Australia), \"but I don't like its head.\" I now asked her if she\nwas not afraid of it, to which she replied, \"No, it can't hurt me, because the\npart of me that is there can't be hurt.\" At this stage her face &88l1med an\nexpression of sunden surprise, and she exclaimed, \"Oh dear, why it's a\nbaby, I thought it was a monkey at first, it's a little black baby left in the\nopen air. That's a funny house there, it is not a house at all, it is made of\nthe bougbs of trees. Humph\" (here she turned up her nose in apparent\ndisgust) \"tbere is a nasty smell here, there is a fire in this place. I'm inside\nnow, it looks like a wurley\" (the native name for their huts). \"I see an old\nblack woman sitting down with her arms round her knees making a funny\nnoise, sbe has a. fur skin round bel' body. Wbat's the matter with that old\nblack fellow 1 He is crOBB with bel' because she has let tbe fire go out;\nhe has struck her with a dead animal like an opoBBum which he has with\nhim. Oh, this place 0068 smell nasty; I must go outside. There are lots\nmore of these wurlies about here. I'm looking at a very old man ; his hair\nis all wbite; he is chewing the root of a tree because he is not well. Ob,\ntbey are dirty tbings. Tbey have got a lot of grease rubbing all over the\nbaby; no wonder it is crying. Now the old woman has spread out a mat\nand put the baby on it. Now I see a lot of other children, all ages up to 16;\nthey have got hold of that dead animal that the black fellow brought j they\nare tearing it up and eating it raw. Now the old people are very crOBB with\nthem for taking it, and are making a great noise about it.' The children are\nafraid, and run away and run up the trees like a lot of monkeys. Now the\nold man seems to be blaming the woman for letting them take it. He is\ntalking CroBB, and going like that\" (here she shook her head viciously) \"at\nhel'. Now I am away from there, I see a lot of blacks, They have long\nwooden things, and are running like anything.\"\nAs our time was now expired I was compelled to wake her up.\nAll the above account may be literally correct, and her information may\nhave been obtained only from the aura emanating from the tooth of the\nnative, but there is the possibility of the faculty of thought-transference\nhaving been at work. However, to combat that idea I should mention that\nI have scores of times tried my level best to cause my clairvoyants to see\npictures and visions by conjuring up in my own mind the most vivid pictures\nimaginable, but up to the present moment I have never succeeded in making\nmy clairvoyants think one thought, or say or see anything I have tried to\nmake them see in tbat way.\nBy way of testing whether the ordinary sellse of touch was utilised by\nthe clairvoyants, I have broken different shaped pieces from the skull of the\nDigitized by Google\n\f\"Nov., 1889.] Journal of Society for P8ychical Research. 159\nblack fellow from which the tooth was taken, and in every case I receive a\nllimilar account from the clairvoyant.\nM.e!. 9\nOn another occasion I wrapped a small fragment of the skull in a piece\nof paper, and ou placing it in her hands to my great surprise she began to\ndescribe a factory with a lot of rollers, and a lot of stuff that \"looked like\ndirty soup,\" evidently referring to a paper factory. However, she suddenly\nbegan to complain of a vision being \"mixed,\" because she could see \"two\nkinds of places at the Bame time,\" and she did not like it. On my telling\nher not to trouble about the place with the rollers, &c., but to go on telling\nme about anything else she saw, she began at once to give us a most\ninteresting description of native scenery and encampment, &c.\nI could. fill a volume with cases of the above description, but for\nthe purposes of the Society for Psychical Rt>search I fear they would be\ncomparatively useless.\nSince writing the above four sheets, I have from various causes been\nprevented from continuing my letter; but as I have been conducting clair-\nvoyant experiments twice a week lately, I am now able to quote a case of\nclairvoyance which I think puts the hypothesis of thought-reading out of the\n\u00b7question, although I still think it is not exactly the kind of clairvoyance you\nwould like to have specimens of.\nM.Cl.1O\nA few evenings ago (February 5th) I put one of my clairvoyants to the\nfollowing test, viz., I picked out nine specimens of various substances as\nfollows :-One piece new amber, one tooth of Australian native, one tooth\ntaken from the catacombs of Paris, one piece of old worn amber pipe stem,\none piece coal, one piece ivory, one piece of rock (brought from a manure mill\nin England), one boy's tooth and one piece bezoar from a sheep's stomach.\nThey were all much about the same size, and would feel very similar in the\nfingers except the bezoar, which, of course, is rather yielding, like india-\nrubber. I placed all the specimens together in a plate. I then placed the\nplate in the lap of my clairvoyant, and turning my face in another direc-\ntion, so that it was impossible for me to see the plate or specimens, I guided\nher hand to the plate and instructed her to take up the first thing her fingers\ntouched. She did so, and I then removed the plate out of the way, (still\nkeeping my eyes and face from it), and in less than two minutes she began:\n-\" I've seen these people fighting before; they are not English. I don't\nlike looking at them. They have nearly killed that man. He has several\nwounds, one on his head, aud one on his arm.\" Here she seemed distressed,\nand seemed to turn away from the scene and commenced to look round the\nneighbourhood, and began again :-\n\"What a pity, such a nice place and all knocked about, the soldiers have\nbeen through it; it must be a rich place. Those women look like Romans.\nI'm in the room now where the wounded man is lying. The women are\nrather nice looking, such lots of dark hair. Their dress is white and blue,\nDigitized by Google\n\f160 JoWf\"n(J}, 0\/ Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1889,\nwith gold embroidery round it. Now they are crying because the wounded\nman is dead. I wonder who that is '\/-some old man, with a white robe\nand loose sleeves, he has purple lace down the back and chains and beads\nround his neck and waist down to the ground, and a cross hanging in front.\nHe has hardly any hair on him. He has brought in some long candles; they\nare not made as well as candles are made now, they look like hand-made.\nHe is placing them round the bed. I don't like his face. Oh, I know who it\nis, it is an old Father. Now he has placed a large croBB on the dead body\nand is saying something that I do not understand. Now there are a lot of\npeople in the room dreB8ed in white. The old Father is praying, and they\nare all joining in. Now he is sprinkling something like water on the body\nin the form of a CI'OBB.\" When did all this take place 1 I inquired. \"This\nis 600 years ago. The women's hair iR in plaits, looped up and fastened\nwith long pins with ornaments on ends of pins.\"\nI now asked her what she had in her hand, and, as is commo~ly the case,\nshe said, \"I have nothing in my hand.\" I told her to look and see (clair-\nvoyantly, of course), and she then said, \"This in my hand is a bone, it\nlooks like a tooth,* but too long; it must have belonged to the man I saw\nkilled.\"\nIt should be borne in mind that my clairvoyant's hand was closed over it\nall the time, an\u00b7l not only was she asleep all the time, but her eyes were\nturned downwards and inwards, so that only the white was visible when the\neyelids were forced open. Nor had she ever lIeen the tooth with her naked\neyes.\nSince writing the above I have had occasion to visit one of the adjoining\ncolonies (Victoria), which, with other pressing duties, has again caused\ncOllsiderable delay. However, the dela.y will ena.ble me to selld you what\nto all appearance may be called a case of undoubted clairvoyance. The\ncircumstances are as follows :-\nM.m. 11.\nOne evening (since I began this lettert), whilst I was bURy with several of\nmy clairvoyallts, Mr. Ada.mson, J.P. (one of the leading citizens of\nAdelaide), called, ill company with his daughter, and handing me two or\nthree trinkets which had been suspended to her watch-chain, simply\nremarked, \"We have lost something. Will you kindly see if your clair-\nvoyant can help us in the matter 1\"\nMy clairvoyants all being asleep, I quietly placed the trinkets in the hand\nof the one called MiBB E. Dixon, without remark. In a moment or two she\nproceeded to give an accurate description of the young lady who owned the\ntrinkets. I then said, \"Never mind the young lady, something is lost; try\nand find it.\"\n*Mr. Dobbie tell. us in answer to inquiries, that the tooth which the subject held\nin her hand was the ODe from the catacombs.\ntThe letter was begun in JaDuary, 1886, and finished in March. It appears.\nfrom Mr. Dobbie's Dote-book that the main part ofthe incident occurred before.\nJanuary 11th.\nDigitized by Google\n\fNov.,l889.] Journal Of Society for Psychical Research. 161\nIII few moments she commenced to describe a gold pencil-case which\nshe saw \"lying on the road in one of the suburbs, not in the city, it is not\nthere now, it is in a comfortable-looking ooe-story house, with a garden and\niron railings in front and a two-story building opposite.\" She then de-\nscribed the gentleman who had possession of the pencil-case, whom she saw\nwith his wife, aod also quoted a remark he made, \" We will lay it aside and\nsee if anyone claims it,\" and stated that it was placed\" in a small box.\" My\nclairvoyant seemed unable to give me the locality of this gentleman and his\nhouse; however, in reply to an advertisement next day or day after, a\ngentleman answering the description given by my clairvoyant brought the\nlost pellcil-case to Mr. Adam80n, who, naturally enough, was 80 astounded\nat the correct description of a person none of Uti had ever seen or known, that\nhe took the tram and visited the neighbourhood and house in wldch the\ngentleman resided, and to his astonishment he found that the descriptioll\nwas exact, in fact it was the only house in the neighbourhood having iron\nrailings, also that there actually was a two\u00b7story house oppollite, which was\nalso the only olle in the neighbourhood. Mr. Adamson, on questioning the\ngentleman, found that the pencil-case was found on the road as described ;\nalso that it had been placed in the small box and the remark made re wait-\ning to \"see if it would be claimed by the gentleman.\"\nTo still further test the genuineness of the clairvoyance, I arranged\n(quite unknown to my clairvoya.nt, of course), to have the said gentleman\npresent with about twelve other persons, who all entered the room after I had\nput my clairvoyant to sleep, and, in placing the trinkets and pencil-case in her\nhands again, she immediately found herself at the same house again and saw\nthe same gentleman. I then instructed her to remember (my subjects\nnever remember anything when they wake up unless I instruct them to do\nso) the features of this gentleman, so that if ever she should meet him in\nthe future she would recognise him. I then woke her up, and to the\nastonishment and delight of all present she at once voluntarily recognised\nthe gentleman as the one she had seen when mesmerised. Of course, you\nwill see at once that the fact of the clairvoyant recognising the gentleman\nis not of itself of much scientific value, because the fact that I by this time\nknew the features of the gentleman makes it possible to bring that part\nof the experiment under the category of thought-transferencc, but taken\nin conjunction with the previous parts, I think the idea of thought-\ntransference may be discarded.\nIt is only fair to mention that Mr. Adamson, J.P., is universally\nacknowledged by his very large circle of acquaintances to be one of the most\ncommon-sense and shrewdest men in South Australia, and occupies leading\npositions on many of the public committees and boards of our city.\n(Signed) A. W. DOBBIE.\nThe following statement, Mr. Dobbie tells us, was handed to him\nby Mr. Adamson on MArch 8th, 1886:-\nDEAR SIR,-I have looked through that portion of your letter on pages\n7 and 8, and agree with most of what is there. You had best, however,\nDigitized by Google\n\f162 Journal of Society for Psychical Re8earch. [Nov., 1889.\nleave me ont of the leading citizens, &C. The following is my version of the\naffair:-\nPassing your house one evening, in company with a daughter, who had\nlost a trinket off her watch-chain a week or so previous-who lamented its\nloss, not on account of its value, but as an old keepsake-I said to her;\n\"Come in and see if Mr. Dobbie can find it for you.\" We told you our\ntrouble, that something was lost off a watch chain, and asked your assistance\nin its recovery, promising to bring you next evening the remaining trinkets,\nconsisting of three lockets. You said it was a difficult matter, but you\nwould try.\nYou had three clairvoyants asleep when we entered the room; shortly\nafter you placed the trinkets in the hand of one of these, a female. Soon\nafterwards she began a fair description of my daughter, which you stopped,\ninforming her that something was lost which we wanted to find. She was\nsilent for a minute or two, and then said: \"I think I see it now. It was in\nthe dust, and a man has found it.\" The question was put: \"What is it 1\" She\nanswered: \"A ring; there is something on it; it is not a key on it, it's a\npencil-case; it is bright and shiny.\" She was then asked to follow the man\nhome. This caused a long silence. At length she said: \"I am there now; he\nis showing it to a woman. I think it is his wife. He is putting it in a box,\nand saying , We will leave it there and see what comes of it.''' She then said\nmore than once\" They would give it up if they knew who it belonged to, they\ndo not want to keep it, oh, I wish I could take it away, they seem honest\npeople.\" She then, in answer to questions put, described the house in which\nthe people lived, also the neighbourhood exactly, but could not give the\nlocality, as she had never been there before-described the house as old\nand comfortable-like within a garden, a wrought-iron railing in front; no\nchurch could be seen from there, but a large two-story building opposite.\nShe described the man accurately who had the pencil-case, and advised\nadvertising for its recovery, as she was sure of its return if it was known who\nwas the owner.\nI may here say that this had already been done, and next day, after the\ninterview, tbe article was returned to my son at his office in town, the man\nwho brought it left his address, and I have since visited his house and inter-\nviewed him, and he was in no small, degree astonished when he found that\nwe had known so much about him and his proceedings. I may state that I\nwas almost an unbeliever in clairvoyance until the above incident, but am\nnow compelled to change my opinion, and acknowledge that there is some-\nthing in it I cannot understand.\n(Signed) A. ADAMSON.\nP.S. Since the above occasion you have in my presence traced the\nmatter further by the clairvoyant following the finder to Adelaide, and seeing\nhim go upstairs to my son's office and there give up the pencil case. Of this,\nas of all former knowledge of the article in question, she must have been in\ntotal ignorance.\n(Signed) A. ADAMSON.\nDigitized by Google\n\fNov.,I889.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 163\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nDUPLEX PERSONALITY AND THE FRENCH EXPERIMENTS.\nTo the Editor of tke JOURNAL OF THE SoCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL REsEARCH.\nSIR,-I am anxious to call attention to some passages in the \"These de\ndoctora.t\" which M. Pierre Janet submitted to the \"Facult6 des Lettres\" in\nParis last June, because they appear to me to afford illustra.tion of the\ndanger of deriving psychical ideas, as the French school seem to be doing,\nalmost exclusively from the observation of hysterical patients; and also of the\ndifficulties which attend any attempt to explain the laws of mind in accord-\nance with a uniform basis of consciousness. As regards the first, M. Janet\nhas lately published a large volume recounting his researches into the cases\nof \"fourteen hysterical women, fin men subject to the sawe complaint, and\neight other individuals subject to mental alienation or epilepsy.\" As re-\ngards the second, M. Janet, while not directly affirming the Unity of Conscious-\nness,considers that the\" phenomena of consciousness, which are aut.omatically\ndeveloped by habit, are not, in the normal man, grouped and combined\n(synthetises) 80 as to form a second self, as in hemi-somnambulism.\"\nM. Janet's view, then, appears to be that the phenomena of automatism,\nnot being evidences of a second self, are due to a modified condition of the\nnormal self, and that condition or affection a morbid one, due to weakness-\n\"les ph6nomtmes d'automatisme \"ont uniquement dus a. la faiblesse.\"* He\ndivides these phenomena under four heads-absence of mind, instinct, hahit,\nand passion. I must not claim space to follow M. Janet through the whole of\nhis argument, but I would remark in passing that some of the greatest\nintellects in the world have been exceptionally subject to absence of mind;\nI suppose-to name the first two cases that OL'Cur to me--that M. Janet\nwould scarcely class Sir Isaac Newton and Archbishop Whately as weak\nmen 1 As regards instinct, I suppose that even M. Janet himself occasionally\n*We hardlythink that M. Janet'li meaning is quite represented by this quotation.\nThe sentence from which it is extracted runs as follows: .. Si les phenomenes d'auto-\nmatisme sont uniquement clus ala faiblesse\" [which is to be inferred from the preced.\ning discussion] ..ils doivent existerchezl'hommenormalcomme chezIe malade; mais,\nau lieu d'~tre seuls comme chez celui\u00b7ci, Hs sont chez celui\u00b7la masques et depasses par\nd'autl'esphenomenespluscomplexes.\"-L'A utomatismePsychologique, p. 460. Thus\nfaibleBJJe is distinguished from disease as a thing which we may expect to fiud in a\nhealthy man. And the fact that M. Janet does not considel' that the phenomena of\nautomatism depend necessarily on morbid conditions is proved by his immediately\nafterwards pointing out that normal sleep is one of these conditions. This is again\nshownfurthel' on in discu8singdistraction,orabsenceof mind. Aftersayingthat this\nmay arise from fatigue, M. Janet goes on (p. 462): .. Mais la m@medistractionpourra\n@tredueaune concentration exceSBive de la pensee, l'un autre elite a une grande puis-\nsance d'attention qui sam retrecir la pensee vel'itablemeltt deplace Ie champ de la con\u00b7\nscience.\" That he does not consider a state in which automatic action occurs to be\nundesirable is shown in his discussion of instinct, where he says (p. i63), \"on peut\ndire que l'instinct c'est I'activite dirigee par des perceptions nettement conscientes\nchez I'animal et formant m@me la totalite de son esprit, presque toujours sub\u00b7con\u00b7\nscientes chez I'homme dont l'esprit est rempli par des phenomenes plus eleves.\"-\nEDITOR.\nDigitized by Google\n\f164 Jo'U'l\"YUll of Society for P8ychical Re8earch. [Nov., 1889.\nperforms such actions as mastication and deglutition without cOllscious\nattention to them, and perhaps sometimes puts on his hat on leaving his door\nfrom habit alone.\nBut it is under the last head-\" la passion \"-of which the more usual\nEnglish equivalent is, perhaps, emotion-that M. Janet (consistently with his\ntheory of weakness) announces the most startling conclusions. Thus, it is\nnot only rage, or fear, which betoken weakness, but love! Since love is an\nemotion, and all emotions are forms of weakness, of course there is no\nalternative, and M. Janet sticks manfully to his point. When\" in the spring\na young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love\" it is, says M. Janet,\na symptom of moral disease due to overwork, shock, or grief, &c., which have\nmade him incapable of collected thought. Love, like other \"virulent\nmaladies\" (!), requires a \"period of incubation,\" but it is all the time\n\"working underground\" till it becomes powerful enough to shake the\nconstitution. Such, according to M. Janet, is the tender pll.llBion \"brought\ndown to its eBBential psychological characteristics.\"\nNow, a very few considerations will, I think, suffice to show that such a\ntheory as this is contrary to human experience. Is it in the Hush and\nvigour of youth or in the decline of age that the passioDs are strongest 1 Are\nlove matches more common from 20 to 30 years of age or from 50 to 601 Is\nthe temper more in need of restraint and the impulses of guidance in youth\nor in age 1 If, therefore, we find that the emotions are more vigorous and\nturbulent in our hot youth than in our declining years we cannot resist the\ninference that strong emotions are symptoms of strength. Otherwise-and\nthis is the difficulty which constantly besets the believer in Unity of COll-\nsciousness-strength is a symptom of weakneBB \"which is absurd.\"\nBut, nevertheless-and here we are all agreed-not to have the emotiolls\nunder the control of the reason and the will is a symptom of weakneBB\nWeakness, however, of what 1 Of the emotions 1 Of course not. Of the\nman himselfl But the emotions are part of the man, and on the unity\nthl'ory how can he be strong and weak at once 1 Of the will? Assuredly.\nIf then the will and the emotions are in confl.ict, the weaker of course will\nsuccumb to the stronger. But if two forces are ill oppositioll, they cannot\nbe the sallle force. If the Ego be one and indivisible it cannot be divided in\nconflict against itself. Either the emotions are not of the Ego, or the will is\nnot of the Ego, or there are two distinct personalities in one Ego, which\nmake It duality in unity.\nNow let us see how the strength or weakness of the emotions and the\nwill works out on the basis of a duplex personality. There are four poBBible\ncombinatiolls which determine the character of the individual.\n1. The active and passive personalities are both vigorous. Here we\nhave the man of strong p8.BBions dominated by a strong will. These are the\nmen who rule their fellows aud go forth conquering and to conquer. Their\nemotiolls are regulated, and kept in check, as the force of steam is cOllfined\nwithin the boiler for use and not for mastery. But very occasionally some\nstronger impulse than usual overmasters their self-control, and then their\nanger is terrible, 01\u00b7 their love is consuming. They are unfortunately more\ncommon in heroic fictioll than in real life. Adam Bede is a good example.\nDigitized by Google\n\fNov., 1889.] Jou1'nal of Society for Psychical Research. 165\n2. The active personality is strong and the passive weak. These are the\nshrewd calculating men of the world who never allow \"feeling\" to interfere\nwith \"business,\" who before committing themselves to any course of\naction always ask \"will it pay 1\" or the philosophers who look at every-\nthing from a scientific point of view till they cease to feel strongly on any\nquestion.\n3. The passive personality is strong and the active weak. These are the\nartists who follow art wherever she leads them, the poets whose genius\ndistances the more sober paces of intellectual progression, but are incapable\nof much purely intellectual achievement; or the French heroine whose\nwhole nature is overborne by a \"grande passion.\" Carpenter in his\nXentat Physiology well remarks that persons of genius \"are often very\ndeficient in the power of even comprehending the ordinary affairs of life.\"\n4. Both personalities are weak. These are the aged with failing powers\nwho, incapable of strong anger, are, nevertheleBS, constantly given to nervous\nirritability which, feeble as it is, they cannot control; the fractious invalid]\nthe weak youth, or the senile lover who is taken with every fresh face, ana\nmaunders about the \"pretty BOuls\" like the old gentleman in Pink\n])O'mi1We8; and lastly, the hysterical patients, who, like a ship without\nrudder or compass, are blown about by every wind of feeling however slight,\nand from whom I cannot help suspecting that M. Janet has taken his\ncurious idea that emotion and love are symptoms of weakness.\nIt is a perfectly natural sequence from the constant study of the morbid\nthat the student himself should contract morbid ideas. For our recognition\nof morbid states must depend upon our power to differentiate them from\nnatural ones, and if we confine ourselves too exclusively to the former, they\nwill cease to strike us as unnatural, and we shall be in danger of founding\nourselves upon them, as though they were examples of law in the human race\nat large. That is precisely the danger which it seems to me the new school\nof experimental psychology has most need to guard against.\nTHOMAS BARKWORTH.\nA THEORY OF \"HAUNTING.\"\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nSIR,-In investigating the subject of apparitions the Society for Psychical\nResearch have named one daBS\" Phantasms of the Living,\" being cases\nof the appearance to friends or relations of persons at or near the moment\nof death. These have been very succeBSfully dealt with on the telepathic\ntheory, and it is my object to extend that theory so as to embrace the cases of\nPhantasms of the Dead. This has, indeed, been done to a certain extent\nalready, but there are many points still to be explained. In her paper\non \"Phantasms of the Dead\" in Part VIII. of the Proceedings of the Soeiety\nfor Psychical Research, Mrs. Sidgwick gives four theories of apparitions.\nThe first two require the agency, through practically unlimited time, of\neither the mind of the disembodied spirit, or of the quasi-physical spirit\nitself; but, however much we may believe in the mental activity of a person\nwhen dying, we have no right to assume continued activit.y after the\ncessation of all that we really know of as individual personality. The third\nDigitized by Google\n\f166 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1889\u2022.\nand fourth theories I would combine, as I believe together they will give-\nespecially if extended-a working hypothesis for the examination of new\ncases. These two theories are that the first appearance is 1I0t due to the\ndead at all but is a purely subjective hallucination on the part of the per-\ncipit'nt ; and subsequent appearances are, on the part of the first percipient,\ndue to unconscious expectancy j and on the part of others due to \"some\nsort of telepathic communication from the first percipient.\" Also that\n\"some subtle physical influence\" in certain buildings may be the cause of an\napparition. I would extend and modify these two theories into one, viz :-The\nfirst appearance may be due to the telepathic transference of a mental effort on\nthe part of some person not necc68l1arily the decedent or even a relation\nof the decedent. Subsequent appearances may be due to the same cause.\nor to the mental effort of the first percipient as a new source of telepathic\ndisturbance. The telepathic impression may be the more easily perceived or\nappreciated by the percipient when helped by various external physical co-\nincidences, e..q., a view of the actual room may help the perception of the\nevent th(lught of as being enacted therein. When considered in all its bear-\nings this last point will be found to have a wide range of application. It\nentirely does away with the necessity of a so-called localisation of telepathic\nimpressions-though this may very possibly exist. For, if we suppose a\ntelepathic disturbance set up by some agent at a centre, to be otherwise\nequally perceptible along all radii from that centre, it will be quite reason-\nable to suppose that that percipient who is, as it were, belped to the per-\nception of the mental picture by the actual perception of a real and\nphysical part of it will be the most likely-perhaps the only-one to\nreceive any abnormal impression.\" It will be seen that the main departures\nfrom Mrs. Sidgwick's theories are that the centre of telepathic disturb-\nance may be someone quitt' other than the decedent or even a relation\nto the decedent j and that the \"subtle physical influence\" is reduced to\nnothing more remarkable than something similar to the help which the sight\nof a familiar room or place muy be able to afford as a reminder of an event\nwhich took place in that room or place.\nIt will, perhaps, make matters clearer if I review some cases from the\nSociety'S collection in the light of the foregoing remarks. Take the case pub-\nlished in the Proceedings, Vol. I., p. 108. This is an account of the\nrepeated apparition through a long period of time of a lady who was con-\nsidered by the various percipients to be friendly towards them though quite\nunconnected with their concerns. The lady who is supposed to be the\noriginal of this ghost was a Miss A., and seems to have met with a tragic end,\nDid she die unmarried, leaving a disconsolate lover behind, in whose thoughts\nshe ever dwelt 1 Such a mental picture on the part of the lover would be, on\nmy theory, easily perceived by those who were' sensitive and dwelt in and\nabout the house-which would be most likely the actual scene of the mental\npicture.\nAgain, there is a case given in the Proceedings, Vol. V., p.415. A lady\nwho used to live in the country dies in London, and is seen by a stranger\non the same day walking round a tomb, which she appears to have often\n* Phantas71l8 o\/the Living, Vol. II., p. 268, 269.-ED.\nDigitized by Google\n\fNov., 1889.) JO'IIh\"nal of Society for Psychical Research. 161\nvisited when living in the country. May not the percipient have l\"l'alised tile\ntelepathic imprell8ion received from some friend or relation of decedent, who\non hearing of the death thought naturally of the decedent as performing a\nfavourite act, especially when such impression was helped into being by the\nactual sight of the tomb in question. This seems the more uaturalsince the\nappearance was not for some hours aftl'r the actual death. In the discuBBion\nof this case in the paper above cited, the following remarks are made:\n\"It certainly tells, as far as a. single case call tell, in favour of the theory of\nindependent poat-mortem appearance as opposed to that of telepathy, or\nthought-transference, in the ordinary sense. For on the one hand the\nhypothesis of a transferred inlpreBBion from thl' mind of a dying person seems\nstrainl'd to the uttermost when (as in this case) tile dying person and the per-\ncipient havl' been connected by no tie of blood or friendship.\" This seems\nto imply that thought-transference only or mainly takes place between per-\nsons related by blood, or close friends; but I think we have no warrant for\nthis couclusion, and there are many other cases in which the percipient was a.\nstranger.\nThe case on p. 416 of the same volume is also a case wlu~re a stranger\nsees an apparition of a man who died ill that room and subsequently recog-\nnises his photograph. This also is easily accounted for on the theory that at\nthe time some relation or friend of the deceased was thinking of him, and that\nthe pcrcipil'nt's mental impreBBion was intensified by his actual presence in\nthe death room.\nThe next case given ill the same part is a very good one, and can be easily\naccounted for on our theory. One person out of three sees repeatedly during\ndaylight an apparition on a certain bed, and it turns out that there was living\nnear at the time, a somewhat excitable person who was the very one to find\nthe decedent actually dead or dying 011 that very bed. This sight must ha'\"e\nleft a great impression on an excitable person who would therefure be ever\nlikely to meutally repicture the actual Beene. It is also very significant that\nonly one of the three persons present saw the apparition, or, I would say,\nwere able to appreciate the mental impreBBion; for we are not justified in\nsupposing that all are capable of telepathic influence. It mustalso be allowed\nthat due consideration and investigation ou the part of a percipieut may\neradicate the hallucination or cause the ghost to .. vanish.\"\nThis complete telepathic theory seems 011 the first impreBBion to involve\na much more extended sensibility to telepathic impreBBion than we have\nhitherto seen ground for supposing. But when we think that all or most\nof our thought-transference experiments have been conducted with such\ncomparatively uninteresting objects for mental concentration on the part\nof the agent, as a card, a number, or a simple geometrical figure, and without\nany aid to the right interpretation of the mental impreBBion on the part of\nthe percipient, and have, nevertheless, often succeeded; how much more\nshould we expect success in the case of one persOIl out of the millions who\nare supposed to be within the range of the telepathic influence, when the\nsubject for mental concentration on the part of the agent is of such an in-\niensely interesting and soul-absorbing nature as the contemplation of the\nform of a deceased loved relation; especially when there is the external\nDigitized by Google\n\f168 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1889.\nphysicial aid to thl' interpretation afforded by the actual view of the room,\nbuilding, or place which the l1'tent has in his mind.\nThis telepathic theory seems to indicate that we could experimentally\nobtain some result!!, confirmatory, or otherwise. Given a good agent, and\na good percipient, it would be quite easy to so arrange the subjects for\nmental concentration on the one part and tbe locality of the- percipient on\nthe other part as to test whether telepathic disturbance is confined to the\nlocality thought of-or is easier of perception when the percipient is present\nin the place under cOllsideration. Experiments might also be arranged to\ntest whether the actual visibility of a part of the thing thought of may not\nbe a help to the perception of the telepathic impression. For example, the\n.agent is thinking of a particular card; will the percipient the more easily\nreceive the impression if confronted by a blank card 1 Other tests might\nbe easily arranged which I need not here descrihl'.\nSAMUEL JOYCE, JUN.\nSUPPLEMENTARY LIBRARY CATALOGUE.\nTHE GENERAL LIBRARY.\nThe foUowing additions have beel~ made Bince the last list (\" Journal\" for\nOctober) :-\nBREVIOR (Thomas), Concerning Miracles.
