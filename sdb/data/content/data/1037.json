His ntw and improved methods of\ncuring the most rooted and most dangerous diseases, consist in regi\nmen, herbs, simple medicines, the choicest articles of the Materitf\nMedicaand \u00e6thereal essences, rendered most salutary and active by the\nmost powerful vital agents in nature, viz. electricity;, vivifying air, music,\nand magnetism ; or, in other words, by gently conveying to those at\nthe altar, or on the Medico-electrical throne, without shock, or any\nkind of uneasiness, into the general system, to the seat of the dis\nease, or only to parts particularly affected,\u2014the pure, active, balmy,\nbracing, and restorative effluvia of medicines, simply, or combined\nwith full genial tides of the celestial electric fire or vital light, mag\nnetic effluvium, vivifying \u00e6thereal air, or with any of those great\nprimary elementary principles which are the universal Pabulum, or\nvital food of animal life, and indeed of universal nature ! The great\npumbers who .daily by these means are cured radically pf the,\nA \u00bbftst\n!rCfb. <f. \\?L.\n\fs 2 ]\nmost dangerous and most confirmed diseases, are really astonishing\u2014\neven after they have been turned incurable out of hospitals, and\ngiven over by the most celebrated of those physicians who stand in\nthe regular medical trammels. Dr. Graham, therefore, for the public\ngood, as well as for his own honour and emolument, thinks it his\nduty to depart from what is called the regular mode, by thus pub\nlicly announcing the nature and properties of these three most valu\nable medicines, and the following important facts.\nist. Electrical \u00e6ther ! This admirable composition is, without ex\nception, the purest and most subtil essence in nature. It is a combi\nnation or concentration of all her elementary powers and vivifying in\nfluences ! being a quintessence exalted by solar light, and extracted by ,\nthe electrical or celestial fire, from the richest aromatics, with the\nbalmiest and most active \u00e6ther.\u2014The experience of every day proves,\nthat for preventing every kind of malignant or infectious disease, and\nfor curing all low, lingering, nervous and putrid disorders, and espe\ncially pains, weaknesses, and other disorders of the head, breast, and\nstomach, nothing on earth can equal this most noble medicine, the\nelectrical aether. Its effects are seemingly miraculous in refreshing\nand recruiting those who are relaxed and exhausted by inordinate and\nexcessive sacrifices to Venus or Bacchus. It coils up and strengthens\nboth body and mind, acting like fresh- oil poured into a tremulous\nexpiring lamp ; and it is most earnestly recommended to those who\nattend courts of justice, sick persons, public meetings, or any of\nthose places of amusement where hundreds of people are crammed\nup, with hundreds of burning candles or lamps, in one building.\n2d. Nervous \u00e6thereal balsam ! or the balmy bracer of relaxed\nfibres, and restorative \u00e6thereal oil for decayed and worn-out constitu\ntions. If the reader can conceive of the richest, purest, and most\nstrengthening parts of all the cordial, bracing, and nourishing things\nhe is acquainted with in nature being extracted, purified, exalted, and\nconcentrated into a small compass, by the irresistible powers of pure\n\u00e6ther and the celestial or electrical fire, he may also conceive of the\nnature and properties of this most precious balsam, which instantly\ncures all those lesser nervous complaints occasioned by tea, coffee, bad\nwine, and pernicious liquors. In lowness of spirits too, in head\naches, tingling of the ears, dimness of sight, lots of memory, apo\nplexies, convulsions, hysteric sits ; in consumptive and asthmatic com\nplaints ; and in all those tormenting lingering fevers, heats and chilli\nnesses, and in those tremors and quiverings of body, and restless\nanxieties, dread, honors, gloominess, discontent and unsettledness of\nmind, which proceed from an irregular circulation of the blood and\nanimal spirits, or from fpalms, debility, or relaxation of the nervous\nsystem, this \u00e6thereal balsam will always be found of immediate ser\nvice, and by a gentle and persevering course of it, and of the impe\nrial pills, a perfect and lasting cure will in general be obtained ; be\ncause by them the blood and juices are purified, sweetened, tem\npered, aud brought to a pure fluid state; while the solids are braced\n%, . up\n\ft 3 1\nup and strengthened ; the genial vital warmth promoted; the animal\nspirits increased and invigorated ; and the nerves sheathed, nourished,\nsteadied, and firmly coiled up.\n3d. Imperial electrical pills ! or universal purifiers of the blood\nand juices. This title was given to them to mark their infinite supe\nriority over all the analeptic or stomachic pills, antiscorbutic drops,\nand alterative medicines that perhaps ever were invented, or which\nare now used in the world. In all weaknesses, oppressions, flatulen\ncies, cholicky gripings, want of appetite, and windy distensions of\nthe stomach and bowels, especially when those uneasy and tormenting\ncomplaints proceed from scorbutic, venereal, gouty, rheumatic and\nbilious humours, fretting, corroding, and irritating the nervous coats\nof the stomach and bowels ; or from heats, acidities, crudities, and\nindigestions, occasioned by full and foul feeding, excessive drinking of\nstrong and bad wines, spirituous or malt liquors, heats and colds, or\nforfeits ; irregular and late hours as to sleep ; want of exercise and\nperspiration, &c. &c. in all such cases, the imperial pills are con\nstantly found to give immediate relief, and by a regular and gentle\nperseverance in the use of them, a perfect and lasting cure will as\nsuredly be obtained.\nRubbing and exercise are universally allowed to be good for the re\ncovery, as well as for the preservation of health. Now these three\ngreat medicines act by exciting the electrical fire in the body and\nlimbs, which removes obstructions, animating and bracing the whole\nsystem. The imperial pills, therefore, the \u00e6thereal balsam, and elec\ntrical \u00e6ther, being filled with the vivifying electrical or celestial fire\nand solar light, which the balmy resins of which they are composed\nhave imbibed and do retain, promote effectually all the natural and\nnecessary circulations and secretions, and consequently must be of the\ngreatest service to those persons, especially to females, who take too\nlittle free air and exercise, though at the same time they live full, and\nare of a costive or irregular habit. Upon the same rational grounds\nthey are found exceedingly beneficial in those heats, spasms, pains, and\nuneasinesses in females, which are occasioned by the periodical fulness\nof their vessels, and from certain other causes: but their good effects\nin gouty, dropsical, scorbutic, and rheumatic cases, and in all scurfy\neruptions or pimples of the face, fores, blotches, or scurf on the\nbody and limbs, however inveterately blended in the blood, however\nobstinately confirmed in the constitution from former follies, impru-\ndencies, and irregularities (especially from debilitating evacuations)\nare really astonishing. The dreadful train of sufferings which the\nmiserable patients in the above cafes endure, and even the most ob\nstinate rheumatic, gouty, or venereal pains, swellings and weaknesses\nof the joints, &c. yield very readily to the superior and irresistible\nefficacy of electricity, and of these excellent pills and \u00e6thereal bal\nsam ; and they are a diuretic of so soft yet searching a nature, that\nthey give instant ease in the severest fits of the stone and gravel ; and\n,by persevering in a proper course of them, and at the same time of\nA 2 my\n- J\n\fC 4 3\nmy electrical \u00e6ther, and drinking veal broth with gum arabic dissolved\nin it, or of a decoction of liquorice, linseed, poppy heads, and marsh-\nmallow roots poured upon shred leeks, and bruised fennil or anniseeds,\nwith plenty of treacle or honey,\u2014.they often have been found to cure\nradically those dangerous and most excruciating disorders\u2014the stone,\ngravel, and all obstructions and weaknesses of the urinary organs.\nThese three great medicines are sold in phials of one guinea,\nios. 6d. and 5s. each, with very ample directions, at the Temple of\nHealth, Adelphi, and at the Temple of Hymen in Pall Mall.\nFrom the Medical Transactions at the Temple of Health, just\npublished, the following important cures, and most respectable names\nare extracted, viz.\nFourteen cures in obstinate and severe maladies, especially in the\npalsy, rheumatism, &c. which Dr. Graham lately had the high honour\nof performing immediately under the eye, and of having attested by\n(he hand-writing of her Grace the Duchess of Devonshire, the Right\nHonourable Lord and Lady Spencer, the Right Honourable Lady Cler-\nmont, his most Serene Highness Frederic Prince of Hesse Cassel, and by\nmany others of the first nobility, both in church and state, in Europe ;\nwho, for the encouragement of the afflicted, and general benefit of\nmankind, were pleased, voluntarily and unsolicited, to honour Dr.\nGraham with the above-mentioned certificate.\nN\u00b0 15. Mrs. Catharine Macaulay Graham, the justly celebrated his\ntorian (sister to John Sawbridge, Esq; Member of Parliament for the\ncity of London) cured of that variety of symptoms which accompany\na relaxed system, and an irritable state of nerves, viz. pains in the\nstomach, indigestion, trembling of the nerves, shivering fits, repeated\npains in her ears and throat, and continual agitations of body and\nmind, which had reduced a constitution, originally delicate, to an al\nmost insupportable degree of weakness and debility. These com\nplaints had been brought on or increased by a seven years severe ap\nplication, in writing her invaluable History of England, of which eight\nvolumes in quarto are already published.\nTo the letter which that lady had the goodness to publish, contain\ning a full account of her late cafe and cure, addressed to Dr. Graham,\nis annexed the following Postscript :\n*' I am happy, Sir, in being able, from what I have seen, and from\nwhat has come to my certain knowledge, to congratulate you on the\ngreat success which has attended YOUR MEDICINES and methods\nof cure by Electricity, &c. in the most desperate stages of con\nsumptive, asthmatic, nervous, bilious, and scorbutic diseases : such in\nstances cannot fail to establish the reputation of tour medicines\nand medical practice, to your own honour and emolument, and to the\nblessingpf mankind in general, in matters of the highest sublunary im\nportance, namely the prolongation of life, and the enjoyment of health.\n*H!* Mrs. Macaulay has lately man ied Dr. Graham's only brother. At\nthe lime of performing so great and so important a cure, and of receiv\ning the letter aljoye alluded to, and which is published at full length,\nin\n\fI s }\nin Dr. Graham's medical practice, Dr. Graham little expected the\nhigh honour and happiness of so near an alliance with so great and so\namiable a character.\nThe lady of Sir John Miller, Baronet, of Bath-Easton Villa, near\nBath, cured of a rheumatic pain in her face to which her ladyship had\nbeen subject for some years; and likewise of head-aches, colds, and\nslight sore throats. In the fame letter which she had the goodness to\nfend to Dr. Graham, with leave to publish it, her ladyship describes\nthe cafe and cure of her own French maid, of a complication of disor\nders, especially of severe nervous complaints, adding, \" I think it, Sir,\nincumbent on me thus publickly to mention, that, to my certain know\nledge, you have proved your skill in the cure of three other persons,\nwhose maladies, in many respects, were of a still more dangerous\nnature.\nN\u00b0ai. The following letter is from the Rev. Dr. Thomas Wilson,\nRector of St. Stephen's, Walbrook, and Senior Prebendary of\nWestminster.\nTo Dr. GRAHAM.\nSIR,,\nI have no sort of objection to your mentioning in the most public\nmanner the perfect cure you happily performed in my cafe, by means\nOf YOUR \u00c6THEREAL AND ELECTRICAL MEDICINES, &C. I had\nlaboured, for many years, under an oppression of the lungs ; attended\nin the spring and fall of the year with a troublesome and tormenting\ncough. My complaints had baffled the skill of the best physicians in\nLondon.\u2014The hot well water at Bristol I had often tried, but to no\neffect ; and the nauseous drugs from the apothecaries lhops were so\nfar from giving me ease, that they really increased my sufferings, in\nsomuch, that I had great reason to apprehend a confirmed asthma\nand consumption. It is now, Sir, near twelve months since you cured\nme, and I have not had the least return of those troublesome and\nvery dangerous complaints,\nI am, dear Sir,\nAlfred-house, Bath, Your sincere friend,\nJan. 5th.

The regular faculty were of no service to him. The lea, Har-\nrowgate, upwards of sixty bottles of Mr. Norton's Maredant's drops ;\na long course too of Mr. Spilsbury's, and in short every outward and\ninward application and medicine, foreign and domestic, that could be\nthought of, produced not the smallest nor the most tranlient good effects.\nIn this pitiable, and indeed hopeless condition, did he apply to me.\n\u2014Many days did not elapse before his friends observed the most flat\ntering alteration for the better in every respect, by the determined use\nof my great medicines, in less than a month, his worthy and respecta\nble father, and several who were acquainted with him, came to see\nhim ; they scarcely knew him again ; he had now recovered his fiesti, '\nand a fresh healthy colour and good spirits, and could bear all his\ncloaths fast abont him. The young gentleman was with me only\nabout six weeks ; he went home supremely happy, aud was, when I\nlast saw him, after having been the half of his life in the above con\ndition) intirely clear, whole, and well in every respett, except a little\nrawness on one leg, and behind his ears, which is now, I hope, per\nfectly well, by having continued a little while longer the medicines and\noutward applications.\nN\u00b0 52. J. L. Esq; a worthy gentleman of distinction, perfectly cured\nof a most painful, inconvenient, and dangerous complaint in the urinary\norgans, under which he had laboured for eleven years, proceeding\nfrom ill-cured, or rather neglected, venereal disorders, in a long and\nimpetuous pursuit of pleasure. This gentleman had tried, at different\ntimes, the principal physicians and surgeons in England, Scotland,\nFrance, and Italy ; bougees too, and every thing that could be thought\nof, without any considerable or lasting benefit. He was completely\ncured in two months by the peculiar methods I employ in such truly\npitiable cases.\nExtraordinary and well authenticated Cures performed at\nthe Temple of Health in London, in the course of\nthe la\/l Tear, 1 780.\nN\u00b0 53. Miss Beat, at Mr. Schroeder's warehouse (robe and habit\nmaker to her Majesty) in Tavislock-street, Covent Garden, was radi\ncally cured by my three great medicines, &c. of a terrible disorder\nwhich- had broke out and spread over both sides of her face and neck,\nB which\n\f[ io ]\nwhich with her eyes and ears it had swelled to a monstrous degree. The\nhumour was so sharp and so excessively profuse, that day and night, it\n, would wet and run through twenty folds of cloth or handkerchiefs in one\nquarter of an hour ; but notwithstanding that incredible discharge,\nthe swellings did not abate, but the disease soon degenerated into a\n\u2022 mimbness and mortification ; blind of both eyes, for two days unable;\nto swallow or smell, and dead on one fide of her body ; her face,\nneck, eyes, and ears being entirely covered over with a thick cold\nblack crust or scab, like a complete mask, with the mortification far\nadvanced in her throat inwardly.\u2014Miss Beat was soon restored to\nperfect health, and cleared of every appearance of the disorder, by\nthe judicious and incredibly -plentiful use of the three great medicines,\nafter having been thus as it were in the very jaws of death. The\nyoung lady herself, and the worthy family with whom she lives, very\nreadily declare to every respectful enquirer the truth of the above\nseemingly miraculous cure.\nN\u00b0 54. Mrs. Vere, a worthy and most respectable lady, at her house,\nN\u00b0 52, Greek street, Soho, effectually cured of a most dreadful nervous,\nbilious, and paralytic disorder, of twelve years standing, by electricity,\nand my three great medicines, after having consulted and tried in vain\nalmost every physician of note, and every powerful medicine. The\ndisorder was attended with a total loss of appetite, an almost constant\nvomiting, after eating, and a paralytic numbnefs of both hands. It\nis at the earnest desire of Mrs. Vere, that this important cure is\nmade public.\nN\u00b0 55.

Mrs. York, at the Bunch of Grapes, in Hemming's Row, St.\nMartin's Lane, was seized last autumn with a violent stitch in her side ;\nat first, bleeding three times a day, two blisters on her back, and two\non her side, moved the pain into her breast and stomach, producing a ,\nviolent cough and shortness of breath ; at length the disorder seized\nher bowels, with the most cruel racking and excruciating pains, never\neasy one moment day nor night. During the whole of the fortnight\nbefore Mrs. York came to the Temple of Health, she had not in all\n\u2022 that time two hours sleep ; her legs swelled through weakness, and\nthe pain was a sort of violent burning, as if all on flames.\u2014Mrs. York\nwas most perfectly cured by a three weeks course of my three great\nmedicines, and a few electrical operations.\nN\u00b0 57. A worthy and very respectable lady, who had been married\nfive years, without children, owing to weaknesses, and profuse evacua\ntions at certain periods, was so perfectly strengthened and invigorated in\nevery respect, by my uervous \u00e6thereal balsam, the divine or prolific\nbalsam,\n\fbalsam, and gentle electrical operations, that the lady is now in perfect\nhealth and spirits, advancing in a happy pregnancy.\nN\u00b0 58. Captain Hoar, in Craven-buildings, Drury-lane, encouraged by\nhaving been cured by me, a few years ago, of a most terrible inflamma\ntion of both eyes, with white specks or skins over the sight, so as to\nhave been almost entirely blind,\u2014having been afflicted for several\nmonths last winter with a severe rheumatic gout, which swelled his\nhands, wrists, arms, and even one fide of his jaw bone, to a great de\ngree, with dreadful pain when in bed, or upon catching cold, was\nperfectly cured of all his complaints by a judicious course of my\nthree great medicines, and electrifying now and then for a few weeks\nwith my apparatus, which exceeds, by many thousand degrees, any\nthat ever was in the world for strength, safety, ease, elegance, and\nusefulness.\nN\u00b0 59. An eminent physician in Westminster, having been afflicted\nfor many weeks with a vertigo, or noise, giddiness, pain, and fullness of\nthe vessels, and weakness of the nerves of his head, attended with a\nheavy drowsiness, yet an inability to sleep, was perfectly cured, after\ntrying every thing else in vain, by my nervous \u00e6ther, a few of my\nimperial pills, and a short mild course of electricity by my irresistibly\npowerful machines.\nN\u00b0 60. A gentleman was perfectly cured by my medicines alone, after\nhaving laboured for several months under a most dreadful nervous com\nplaint, which had several times attacked him with an alarming palsy,\nand deprived him at times of almost all the faculties of both body and\nmind. He has now firm nerves, and a serene happy contented\nmind.\nN\u00b0 61. Captain R. B. at the Spring Garden Coffee-house, Charing-\ncross, cured of a fever and ague, of thirteen months continuance ; his\ndisorder baffled the skill of all the physicians and surgeons with the\nroyal army at New York, for nine months ; on his return to England\nhe could scarce walk, but in two weeks he was perfectly cured by my\nelectrical \u00e6ther, imperial pills, and electricity.\nN\u00b0 62. A most worthy lady of fashion and fortune in Hanover-square,\nin repeated and most violent inflammations of her liver and bowels, was\nbled about twenty times in one month, by which her whole frame\nwas so exhausted and broken down as not to be able for many weeks\nro walk across her room ; and notwithstanding every possible assistance\nfrom the first physicians, &c. the lady found herself growing daily of\na deeper yellow with the jaundice, an increase of the perpetual fever,\nand of all the dropsical symptoms, and the whole aggravated by so\nwretched a nervous complaint, that she could not rest one hour in a\nwhole night. For many weeks the violent spasms or catchings, and\ndrawings up of her legs, got to such a pitch of violence as to hinder\nher from sleeping alrogether. In this low, distressed, and hopeless\nstate flie applied to me (by the recommendation of a worthy gentle\nman from the East Indies, whom 1 had had the happiness of curing\npf an asthmatic complaint) and she received a most perfect cure of all\nB 2 her\n\fc i2 r\nher complicated maladies, by means of a regular fix weeks course of\nroy three great medicines, assisted by electricity, after an almost fatal\nindisposition of near two years standing.\nN. B. It is now near a year since this most intelligent and most\namiable lady was cured, and she has remained perfectly well ever since.\nIn a letter which I had the honour of receiving from her with the\nabove account of her cafe, she had the goodness to fay, that although\nshe did not chuse to have her name exposed to the whole world, yet\nstfe gave me full liberty to refer any person to her who wished to have\nfarther particulars, or any other confirmation of this most important,\nand (to all her friends) seemingly miraculous cure.\nN\u00b0 63. A young woman, among the number of those who partake of\nthe above lady's charitable benevolences, who had for several years la\nboured under a variety of complaints, fores, and swellings, from\nnever once having been visited by the necessary monthly evacuations,\nwas at this lady's expence cured by a short course of my imperial\npills and electrical \u00e6ther, assisted by electricity. What had been so\nlong wished for appeared the second or third day after she began the\nuse of my most valuable medicines.\nN\u00b064- A most amiable lady of fashion, a friend of the lady whose case\nis last related, was afflicted for a considerable time with severe nervous\nand lethargic complaints, insomuch that ihe frequently burst om into\nfits of crying without any cause whatever, and would at times drop\nasleep even when at dinner with much company. She had so violent\na palpitation, that her heart beat like a little hammer against her\nbreast, producing likewise universal tremors ; and these dreadful\ncomplaints continued to encrease notwithstanding the assistance of\nphysicians, and the more friendly powers of travelling, sea air, and\nsea bathing. This worthy lady was likewise completely cured of all\nher complaints, by a short course of my nervous \u00e6thereal balsam and\nelectrical \u00e6ther, assisted by electricity, and thereby restored to perfect\nhealth and firmness of body und of mind, which she has continued to\nenjoy for many months without interruption.\nN\u00b0 65. Miss Papps, N\u00b0 74 , Basinghall-street, near Guildhall, aged 21,\nis now completely cured of a dead palsy, which had totally deprived her\nof the use of her limbs for near two years. Miss Papps's limbs, from\nher middle downwards, were cold, dead, and insensible like death\nitself; and she was repeatedly every day afflicted with spasms, draw\nings or convulsions so odd and severe, that they would draw her down\nfrom the scat of the coach or chair, upon the floor in a moment, and\nwere so violent that three or four people could not prevent them, or\nkeep her on her seat. This most amiable young lady had had the\nadvice of the best physicians, and was at Bath for six months without\nan;' fort of relief; but by a regular course of my three great medi\ncines and gentle-genial electrical operations, ssie was completely cured\nin four or five months; she hung up her crutches as honourable tro-?\npbies in the T^snple of Health, and has for several months walked as\n\u2022Well, and enjoys as good health and spirits as any person in Great*\nBritain. The uuth of th^s very great and wonderful cure is per\nfectly\n\fC *3 I\nfectly well known to several hundreds of the friends and acquaint\nances of this respectable family, who will have the goodness to cer\ntify any respectful enquirer at Mr. Papps's house, N\u00b0 74, Basinghall-\nstreet.\nN\u00b0 66. The truth of the following most extraordinary cure may be\nknown by calling at N-> 40, Newman-street, Oxford-street. Mrs. Kirk-\nman was seized with a severe rheumatic fever, which suddenly affected\nher right knee with exquisite pain, which soon spread to the other knee,\nboth feet, hands, and arms, insomuch that she could neither move nor\nturn, nor bear to touch any thing, and was deprived intirely of the\nuse of all her limbs. This amiable lady was tormented night and\nday with the most excruciating pain, convulsive spasms, restlessness,\nand a constant violent heart-burn ; her nails became quite black with\nthe convulsions, nor could she find any relief from opium, laudanum,\nblisters, or any thing that the faculty could do for her. Mrs. Kirk-\nman, however, by the earnest advice of a gentleman whom I had\ncured of a similar complaint, was carried to the Temple of Health as\nhelpless as a new-born child ; but in little more than a week she was\nfreed from all pain, weakness and swelling, and by continuing my\nthree great medicines, and the genial copious streams of the celestial\nfire a week or two longer, she was strengthened, braced up, and invi\ngorated in every respect, so as to walk as nimbly as ever, and has ever\nsince continued perfectly well.\nN\u00b0 67. A very amiable and beautiful young lady offashion, aged ig,\nwas cured by my \u00e6thereal balsam, electrical \u00e6ther, and pectoral herbs,\nof a confirmed consumption, constant pain and soreness in her throat\nand ears, and loss of voice, profuse sweats, constant coughing, spit\ning of phlegm and matter, and swelling of her legs, after she had\nbetn given over by the faculty, and returned to town without any\nbenefit from hei native air in the country. This most desperate of\nall diseases was occasioned by the measles, and the miraculous cure\nwas completely performed anJ established in less than two months.\nN\u00b068. A respectable tradesman too, who from peculiar connections\ndoes not wish for his name to be mentioned, was snatched from the grave\nwhen at the point of death in the same disorder, a confirmed con\nsumption, with ulcerated lungs. He used the \u00e6ther, the balsam, the\npectoral herbs, &c. daily for three or four months, and then he was\nbuilt up in perfect health, flesh, and firmness.\nN\u00b06o. Mr. Beck.jun. brazier, &c. opposite Bell Dock.Wapping, about\nthe middle of last June was seized with a severe pain in his stomach\nand side, insomuch that he could hardly breathe, sloop, sleep, or rest\nnight or day. When he coughed, walked, drew .his breath, or went\nin a coach, he had sharp and severe pains in his breast. Mr. Beck la\nboured under an almost continual fever, thirst, white rough tongue,\ncramps and spasms, his spirits and his flesh wasted every day, the de\ncline was so rapid, and receiving no benefit from medicines, country\nair, &c. that he despaired of recovery, and even of ever seeing his\nfriends agaia.\u2014Mr. Beck, his father, however, wrote for him to\ncorn^\n\fr 14- r\ncome to town ; trie young gentleman came, and in a few weeks he\nhad the good fortune to be perfectly cured of this confirmed con\nsumption, to the great joy of that worthy and respectable family,\nand of all his friends, who beheld with astonishment so important\nand so unexpected a cure, which was accomplished, under God ! by\nmy balsam, \u00e6ther, electricity, and pectoral herbs ; and Mr. Beck has\nremained strong and perfectly well ever since.\nN\u00b0 70. The son of Mr. George Thorburn, N\u00b0 23, Cecil-court, St.\nMartin's-lane, aged nine years, from his infancy (his mother being in a\ndecline when breeding) was seized in the autumn of every year with\na severe cough, spitting, and dropsical fulness and stoney hardness of\nbis belly and stomach, which were swelled up to his throat, nor could\nhe rest or breathe for spasms and convulsions ; but after the measles,\nwhich he had three years ago, he was given up for dead. When his\nworthy parents applied to me, the child was pale, swelled, spit bloody\nhumour in incredible quantities ; could not raise himself up without\ngreat pain and soreness ; he had a great and constant thirst, no appe\ntite ; his breath was difficult and offensive, and so short, that after\ndrinking he could not recover his breath, but seemed ready to expire,\nand could not lay down in bed for the cough, &c\u2014--Receiving little or\nno benefit from all which the faculty could do for him in Scotland and\nEngland, his parents quite despaired of his life ; but by my three\ngreat medicines, electricity, balsamic herbs, &c. the child was per\nfectly cured in a few months, and remains now strong, active, and\nwell in every respect, although this confirmed asthma and consump\ntion was complicated with a dropsical, and severe nervous disorder.\nN\u00b0 71 \u20148. Seven young ladies of very respectable families and genteel\nfortune, and near a hundred women married and single of different ages\nand conditions in life, have been cured by the proper use of my three\ngreat medicines, assisted by electricity, &c. in the course of the last\nyear, of obstinate obstructions in the monthly periods, and of the\nlong train of complaints which are consequent thereupon : and a still\ngreater number have been perfectly cured of the whites, and other\nweaknesses of the organs of generation, by my nervous \u00e6thereal bal\nsam, in ordinary, or by my prolific balsam, &e. in extraordinary cases\nof weakness, barrenness, &c.\nIt is now so universally known, that it is almost unnecessary to\nmention the great number of gentlemen, especially of those who have\nsuffered from imprudence, and from excesses with women and wine,\nor from hot climates, who have been restored to perfect and perma\nnent vigour, and prolific youthful virility, from the most feeble and\ndebilitated states, by those two great and supremely invigorating\nmedicines.\nN\u00b0 79. A worthy man, a book-keeper at a great inn near Lincoln's Inn\nFields, was perfectly and speedily cured by my electrical \u00e6ther, pills,\nand electrifying, when scarce able to walk, with weakness, stiffness,\nand swelling of his knees from a rheumatic gout.\nNT 80.\n\fN\u00b08o. Mr. William Williamson, N\u00b0 I, Little Essex-street, Temple,\nby a severe cold eight years ago, lost the use of his limbs, ofwhich, how\never, he recovered ; but about three years ago he was seized with a\npain in his left side so excruciating, that he was deprived of the use\nof that side. He could not rest night nor day; but racked, he\nscreamed out like a woman in labour, that he might have been heard,\nhe thinks, a mile off. His sufferings brought tears frora almost every\none who beheld him. The pain generally came on about five at\nnight, and lasted till about five in the morning. But the least motion\nwould at any time bring it on ; and nothing but squeezing or pressing\nhard upon it would deaden the fain. Mr. Williamson was under the\ncare of Doctors Lettsome, Salkeld, and George Fordyce a whole year,\nwithout any material benefit, and was electrified by Mr. Partington\n(late of Russel-street, Bloomfbury, but now of Cavendish-square) regu\nlarly for six months. Although Mr. Partington did all in his power for\nhim for so long a time, he became worse and worse, and before he applied\ntome, he had been carried out and into bed for seven weeks. But the\nsecond night after he was electrified by my medico-electrical apparatus\n(which is infinitely more valuable and efficacious than any other in the\nworld) and took of my three great and most precious medicines, he\nwas most sensibly relieved ; and by continuing them and the electri\ncity a few weeks, he had the happiness to be perfectly cured, to the\njoy and astonishment of all his friends, &c.\nN\u00b0 8 1\u20143. Three respectable ladies, recommended by each other,\nwere completely cured of a redness, fiery itching, and swellings of\ntheir legs of considerable standing, by being electrified a few times,\na short course of my balsam and imperial pills, and a cooling strengthen\ning outward application.\nN\u00b0 84. Mr. Alexander Bouk, at the Turk's Head, Castle-street, Seven\nDials, cured of a severe nervous disorder, attended with great pain\nand weakness of his back and limbs, and a considerable weakness\nand dimness of sight, &c.\nN\u00b0 85. George Fowler, servant toJohn Harvey, Esq; of Ickwellbury,\nBedfordshire, was completely cured of a dreadful train of nervous\ncomplaints, which had reduced him to the lowest degree of weakness\nand misery, of body and of mind. This cure was performed by my\nnervous \u00e6thereal balsam alone, assisted by electricity and the cold bath.\nN\u00b0 86. Mr. Clarke, a most respectable grocer and tea-dealer at his\nwarehouse in St. James's-streer near the King's Palace, was perfectly\ncured of a deafness or hardness of hearing, attended with a stupe\nfying noise and hissing, resembling a distant cascade. Mr. Clarke had\nbeen afflicted with the deafness and noise about fifteen months.\nN\u00b0 87. A worthy lady of fashion in Cleaveland-row, St. James's, was\nlikewise perfectly cured of a most alarming deafness of both ears.\nN\u00b0 88. Mr. Potter, a mosl respectable and substantial mast-maker,\nin Narrow-street, below Ratdiff-cross, having been afflicted with a very\nconsiderable degree of deafness in both his cars for about eighteen years,\nbut for the last nine years very bad, was completely and lastingly cured\nin\n\fr us ]\nin about a fortnight, by my irresistibly powerful magnerico;electrical\nand \u00e6thereal operations and applications. This worthy gentleman\nnow hears as well as any man in England.\nN\u00b0 Ktj. A Captain Harman, recommended by Mr. Potter, was\nalso perfectly cured by me of a very great degree of deafness and noise\nin his ears, under which he had laboured for many years.\nN\u00b0 90. Mr. Henry Tosch, at the Bunch of Grapes, Hemming's-row,\nSt. Martin's-lane, quite deaf in both ears.for more than two years, with\na discharge of matter, and a violent and constant noise like the rushing\nof water under London-Bridge, perfectly cured by three or four\n. magnetico-electrical \u00e6thereal operations.\nN\u00b0 91. Mr. Peter Maughee, N\u00b0 1 26, Wardour-street, two doors from\nOxford-street, most perfectly cured of a severe deafness of both ears,\nof several months continuing, occasioned by a cold, and attended by\na singing or buzzing noise, and resisting the skill of two Doctors,\nand the power of all sorts of remedies and applications. The deaf\nness had encreascd so exceedingly the last month, that Mr. Maughee\nhad despaired of ever being cured.\nN\u00b0 92. Mrs. Ann Pillock, at Mrs Hayman's, N\u00b0 42, Carey-street,\nLincoln's Inn Fields, from a severe cold, was afflicted with deafness and\nconstant noise in her head, for upwards of three years. Mrs. Pillock\nhad tried many kinds of oils, &c. as well as electricity, but re\nceived no great benefit from any thing, till she had the happiness to\nbe electrified and fumigated with my balmy aromatic \u00e6ther, and by\nthe most powerful as well as magnificent apparatus that ever was con\nstructed in the world, which soon radically cured her.\nN\u00b0 93. Mrs. Brown, Bridge-row, Chelsea, coming over Westminster\nBridge about eight months ago on a cold blighting night, which\nviolently affected many other people, was seized with a pain in her\nhead, sickness, violent rash, burning, and restlessness, with her head\nand eyes swelled up ; her hearing too was affected in the greatest and\nmost alarming degree, so that she could not hear any thing at times,\nand had a constant noise like the running of water ; she was very\nnervous, weak, low-spirited, and her appetite intireiy gone; but\nMrs. Brown was soon restored to perfectly good fight and hearing,\nand freed from every complaint by electricity, and a short course of\nmy precious nervous \u00e6thereal balsam.\nN\u00b0 94. Mrs. Tuckfield, N\u00b0 4, Warwick-lane, near St. Paul's, by\ntrouble and nervous weakness, was afflicted with total deafness for two\nyears, growing worse and worse, with noise and beating in her head.\nShe became quite weary of life, and would sit sometimes for three\ndays without speaking ; but even this desperate and complicated\nnervous cafe and deafness, was speedily and perfectly cured by my ex\ncellent medicines, and this worthy gentlewoman continues very well.\nN\u00b0 95\u20146. A coachman, and a coach-harnessmaker were both com\npletely cured of a very melancholy degree of deafness under which\nthey had laboured for several years. The acknowledgment of these\ngreat\n\f. t 17 1\ngreat cures, and of their names and places of abode which they gave\nin for publication, were accidentally lost.\nN\u00b097- Mr. Cornelius Batstoneof Hampstead, aged 68 years, had\nbeen afflicted for sixteen years with a most painful windy rheumatic\ndisorder, proceeding from a ladder falling on his loins, which bruised\nhim very much; he lay chiefly on his face in bed with his hands\npressing on his loins, for he could not raise himself up but slowly,\nand with racking, distracting pain, as if he had been pierced with\nswords. Although Mr. Batstone had applied to mmy physicians,\n&c. in vain, yet he met with a perfect cure in a few weeks at the\nTemple of Health, by electricity and my balmy \u00e6thereal medicines.\nThad intended to insert a much greater number of cures in deafness,\nand in various kinds of blindness, weak and sore eyes ; but I find\nthat so far from a small pamphlet being sufficient, a large volume\nwould not contain them.\nN\u00b0o8. Mr. Isaac Goodfalls at N8 n, Hungerford-market, Strand,\nwas afflicted with a violent rheumatism in his loins for about twenty\nyears. His pain was such as to allow him but little rest night or\nday ; and his weakness so great, that he crawled about helpless, and\nalmost despairing of a cure, as he had tried many hundred things\nwithout effect. By my powerful \u00e6thereal and electrical medicines,\nhowever, assisted with electricity and my strengthening balsamic\nherbs for tea, Mr. Goodfalls was soon perfectly cured in every\nrespect.\nN\u00b0 99. Mr. James Walker at Wathnm-green, bydrinking cold water\nwhen very hot, was seized with a stiffness all over, as if covered or\nbound about with strong scales ; a general eruption came out; but\n- as that went off became affected with pain, noise, heaviness, and\nconfusion; he had no pleasure in life: his sight and hearing were '\nconsiderably affected, and he looked as it were through a thick\nmist. Mr. Walker had the good fortune (like almost every one who\napplies at the Temple of Health, or uses the genial medicines there\nprepared) to meet with a perfect and lasting cure.\nN\u00b0 100. Mrs. Careless of Hungerford-market was seized abcut two\nyears ago with a violent pain and swelling in almost every part of her body\nand limbs; fits then came on, which would last six, eight, or twelve\n\u00bb hours, and were so strong as to require four or fix men to hold her\nin bed. After these fits she had most excruciating headachs. In one\nof those fits, about a week before she was brought to me, flic\nseemed to expire, and was laid out as dead. Frequent bleeding in\nthe feet, opiates, and all sorts of nervous medicines seemed to do\nher no good ; but by the medicines and operations at the Temple of\nHealth, Mrs. Careless was to all appearance cured, and made to walk\nstoutly without any help whatever.\nN\u00b0 10 1. Mr. Pike, painter, at Mr. Williams's, box-maker, in White\nHart-yard, Drury-lane, was long afflicted with a rheumatic gout, and\nboth hands and feet so swelled and feeble, that he could neither walk,\ndress, nor undress, was as helpless as a child, nor could he sleep\nC night\n\f\u00a3 i8 ]\nnight or day with the excruciating pain. He was quite cured by my\nmedicines and electricity, when he applied to me in July last; but\nby a severe cold last Christmas the disorder came on agaiii, but was\nremoved, under Cod, by the fame means.\nN\u00b0 102. Mr. Thomas Fox, coach-master, Crooked Billet-yard, Shore-\nditch, KingQand-road, fornineyears, at times, was afflicted with a rheu\nmatic, gouty complaint, which swelled his legs, hams, wrists, arms,\nand shoulders ; he was all over pain, soreness, and weakness. When\nhe rose up, or moved, or was touched, he would sweat and hollo out\nat times like a woman in labour. By a proper course of my me\ndicines, however, and seven electrical operations, this worthy, honest\nman was completely cured, and has remained well ever since last\nsummer.\nN\u00b0 103. Mr. Fox's brother-in-law was likewise cured by my ex.-\ncellent medicines of a low, nervous disorder, with violent pain and\nsoreness in his head, breast, and stomach, after various means had\nbeen tried in vain.\nN\u00b0 104. Serjeant Henry Daviesof the 59th regiment, brought almost\nto death, and discharged from the King's service as incurable, of a\ncompiica'ion of disorders brought on by an every day ague, under\nwhich he had laboured for many months. He was swelled all over, had\na cough and asthma, and was jaundiced to a great degree. In this\nmelancholy and desperate condition, given over by all the army _\nsurgeons and physicians, and finding no fort of relief from any\nthing in town or country, he applied to the Temple of Health ;\nwhere, by a regular course of my most valuable medicines and elec\ntricity, he was perfectly cured of all his' complaints to the astonish\u2014\nment of every body, especially of his former doctors ; and he con\ntinues strong, hearty, and happy in every respect whatever; and this\nbrave serjeant, who weathered the battle of Bunker's hill, and several\nothers, fays, that he now feels himself a match for at least ten\nFrenchmen.\nBy Captain B.'s and Mr. Davis's recommendation many? military\nmen have been lately cured of agues, and other obstinate diseases,\nwhich had baffled all other human means.\nN\u00b0 105- Mrs. Catharine Robertson, at Mr. Howard's, Marigold-\ncourt, opposite the Savoy, Strand, a noble lord's butler, and a great\nnumber of persons too tedious to insert, have lately been cured of\nthe most obstinate agues, and dropsical asthmatic complaints.\nN\u00b0 106. Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Seven Dials, aged about 13,\nand Mr. King's son at Brentford, aged about 9 years, were both\ncured of fits with which they had been long afflicted. Electricity\nwas used three times a week, for a full hour each time, to assist and\nco-operate with my balmy-comforting medicines.\nIn this place, on the books, occur memorandums of a great variety\nof the most obstinately confirmed and complicated venereal cafes in-\ntirely eradicated, as well as of the cure of many young people who\nhad suffered and been reduced to the lowest degree of wretchedness\nand\n\fC 19 ]\nand imbecility of body and of mind, especially suffering in the sight,\nhearing, memory, and nerves by imprudence and diabolical practices\nand indulgencies; but common decency, as well as delicacy, forbids\nthe publication of any of them.\nN\u00b0 107. Miss P. H. a sweetly beautiful and most amiable young lady\nfrom the country, healthy and blooming as the very Goddess of Health !\nwas soon after her arrival in London last July seized with a putrid,\nnervous fever of the most deadly kind. From the first hour this\nangelic Being was struck with every symptom of death ; and she was\nherself deeply and decidedly impressed with the certainty of the fatal\nissue of this disease: so was her amiable sister, and all her anxious\nfriends. To describe the progress and the horribleness of this tedious\ndisease would be to write a volume. It shall suffice to mention a few\n\u2022of the moll important facts. Spasmodic catchings and twitchings of\nalmost every muscle and nerve of her body, especially of her face,\nher sight, hearing, memory, and indeed all the faculties of her\nbody and mind, with every mark of high putrefaction, came on\nvery early in the disease. Nothing that I could do, did her any good ;\n(he never once said in the course of three weeks that she was even\nrelieved by any one medicine or application that was employed.\nBaths of Wine and the most cordial aromatics were used; a score\nperhaps of large and small blisters were applied ; aromatic clysters\nof the Peruvian bark were administered, and that excellent medicine\nin pounds daily, with the addition of castor, saffron, cinnamon, rose\nleaves, musk, salt of amber, and the purest \u00e6ther, were used out\nwardly and inwardly in incredible quantities, without measure, and\nregardless of expence, but all without producing one symptom\nwhereby I could flatter myself with the hopes of her recovery. The\nabove medicine?, however, were continued inwardly\u2014by way of\nclyster\u2014and were almost constantly applied to her head, stomach,\nand feet; music was selected and performed, with proper intervals,\nday and night; she was taken out, even, and most especially when at\nthe worst, in an open post-chaise or chariot ; but the smell of the\ngrave prevailed, and accompanied us every where. Every token of\ndeath continued to haunt us. I was with her continually almost\nnight and day; for I was determined {Codforgive me) that she should\nnot die. My whole soul was in arms, and every bodily faculty was\nstrained to preserve her. So intensely anxious was I for the preserva\ntion of this innocent\u2014this charming young creature! that I believe\nmy foul was transfused as it were into her body, and animating her,\nenabled her to struggle with disease and death, till nature prevailed\u2014\nand health resumed its happy\u2014its welcome empire I\u2014Camphorated\nvinegar\u2014odoriferous wine, my electrical, ambrosial \u00e6ther, and every\ncordial\u2014every vivifying essence which i could devise, were distilled\nin the room, or poured forth in liberal and almost continual libations-\nabout the room, bed cloaths, and carriages.

The intention was merely by\n(travelling in an open carriage to shift the air and the scene every\nmoment, and to do both most effectually bymaking her ride out sot-\nmany hours every day by the sea side, an element she had never before\nin her life even seen. How great and necessary the transition was '\nin a disease where every drop of blood, and every nervous fibre,\nstamps with death, had been dissolved and relaxed into putrid gore\nand lax ligaments ! \u2014the salutary effects demonstrated : for'in a few\nweeks her smell, her sight, her hearing, and all the senses and facul\nties of both body and mind, which depend on good florid blood,\nand balmy, braced nerves, were recovered, and she was built up.\ninto high health the fame beautiful, amiable young lady which nature\nin her kindest mood had formed\u2014studded as it were with roses,\nand streaked with celestial blue ! \u2014the darling of her worthy parents,\n\u2014the beloved companion of her amiable sister, who watched over\nher in that dreadful illness\u2014the supreme joy of the worthy man\nwho has since married her\u2014and an eternal, indisputable monument\nof the transcendent worth of my three great medicines, and infinite\nsuperiority of my peculiar modes of practice in difficult and very\ndangerous cafe?. ' ,-v\nN. B. As this was in reality perhaps the greatest and most extra\nordinary cure that ever was done in the world, I am very happy\nthat so many creditable people were eye-witnesses to the facts as\nabove sketched out; particularly my worthy friend Dr. Mercier,\nphysician in this city, who having had the goodness to visit Miss H.\nin every stage of her illness, was himself an eye-witness to the cure,\n&c. and who will attest the truth of it to any respectful inquirer\nwho may be pleased to call at his house, N\u00b0 21, Frith-street, Soho.\nN\u00b0 108. Mr. Clarke, a worthy and most respectable tradesman at Mill-\nbank, Wefiminfler, having been for 15 years a martyr to the gout, was\npleared several months ago to apply to me. His limbs, especially the\njofots of his toe, and feet, were exceedingly feeble, swelled and stiff, and\nhe walked very lamely indeed ; but by a regular and persevering course\nof my three gre:t medicines, conforming strictly to my regimen, assisted\nby the electr city of my most excellent apparatus, and bathing his feet\nin what I ordered, Mr. Clarke found great benefit from the first day ;\ninsomuch that in a few weeks he actually walked from his own\nhouse in the extreme suburbs of Westminster to Whitechapel, and\npack again, which is many miles, with strength and ease, which he\n'\u2022'\u2022\u2022*,'*\u2022\u2022\u2022 >\u2022 < :, .> \" neither\n\fC 21 3\nneither could, nor had attempted to do for more than twelve years\nbefore.\u2014This judicious gentleman still continues a gentle course of\nmy great medicines, has had no return of the gout, finds the chalky\nswellings, stiffness and weakness very trifling, and in good health and\nspirits walks about his business with pleasure and active alertness. Se\nveral persons with the gout, rheumatism, &c. recommended by Mr.\nC. have likewise received the greatest benefit.\nIf people who have suffered from the gout, rheumatism, or scurvy,\nor from a complication of these maladies, would take even a\nshort course of these excellent medicines once or twice a year,\nthey would suffer very little, or not at all, from these cruel and\ntoo universal diseases.\nN\u00b0 ico. Mrs. S. amantua-maker, an industrious, ingenious, and very\nrespectable woman, was very warmly recommended to my best offices\nby the Right Honourable Lady S. Mrs. S.'s cafe was the most pain\nful and the most obstinate that can be imagined. Her hand, thumb,\nand fingers were swelled, stiff, and contracted to a great degree ;\nand on the inside of her wrist there was a hard swelling the size of a very\nlarge hen's egg. Mrs. S. being prevented from following her business\nas usual, in working for most of the ladies of the first fashion in this\ngreat metropolis who employed her, was the least of her misfortune ;\nfor the excruciating torture which this worthy woman endured both\nnight and day for many months, nay, I believe years, in that hand\nand arm, is not to be expressed. From the long and continual\nwant of rest, her health was considerably impaired. No one of the\nfaculty to whom she had applied, the Bath waters nor any thing\nthat could be thought of proved effectual. But Mrs. S. had not\nbeen three weeks under my care, using my electrical \u00e6ther, electri\ncity, &c. till the swellings, contractions, ancj agonizing pain were\nremoved ; and this worthy industrious woman steeps perfectly well,\nand free from all pain and contraction ; can open and firmly close her\nhand, and follows her business as usual to the great joy of all who\nknow her, especially of the divinely benevolent, the truly Noble\nCountess, who, from the number of great cures her Ladyship has\nknown me to perform, advised her to apply to me at the Temple of\nHealth, Adelphi.\nN\u00b0 no. A very respectable lady in Oxford-street, who from weak\ntremulous nerves and a relaxed habit of body, had always miscarried\nabout the third month in so; r successive pregnancies, applied to me\nin the last ; and being directed to a gentle course of my nervous\n\u00e6thereal balsam, and an infusion of the Peruvian bark, red rose leaves,\nand comfry root, with a milk diet, she was freed from all her nervous\ncomplaints, went her full time, and was happily delivered of a very\nfine plump boy about two months ago.\nN\u00b0 1 1 1 . Mrs. Manly, a most amiable and respectable lady in Cheap-\niide, N\u00b0 119, was severely afflicted with the rheumatism in her head,\narms, and indeed at times all over her, for about three years. It is\nnot to be described what Mis. Manly fusil-red with this cruel and con\nfirmed disease; yet she was perfectly cured by eight or ten gentle\nelectrical\n\f\u2022 ' ['\u00ab ]\nelectrical operations at the Temple of Health, and a short course of\nmy electrical a?ther and impeiial pills. Mrs. Manly was cured last\nsummer, and she has remained all the autumn, winter, and spring\nperfectly well in every respect.\nN\u00b0 112. The son of the above worthy lady, a beautiful boy of five\nyears of age, who had been afflicted with deafness in both ears for\"\nabout twelve months, was likewise perfectly cured of the deafness ia\na few weeks, by the peculiar means I in such cases employ ; and the\nchild is now at boarding-school, healthy and well in every respect.\nThe truth of the above important cures will be certified to respectful\nenquirers by Mr. aud Mrs. Manly themselves, at his silversmith and\njewellery shop, N\" 119, almost opposite Bow Church, Cheapside.\nMr. Manly is the inventor and sole proprietor of the curious\u2014so much\nesteemed\u2014goid-coloured metal.\nN\u00b0 113. Mrs. Sarah Tomlinson, at Mr. Truston's, Little George-\nstreet, Petty France, was seized about three years ago with pains in\nher limbs, so violent as to deprive her of the ule of them. Soon\naiter that, pimples broke out all over her body like the small pox ;\nshe was admitted into St. George's Hospital, where she was salivated,\nand remained there for eight weeks with little or no benefit. She\nwas however by the advice of friends, advised to go in again, which\nshe did, and continued for ten weeks more, but without relief. Mrs.\nT. nevertheless, by my powerful medicines and electricity, was to all\nappearance perfectly cured in two or three weeks.\nN\u00b0 114. Mr. Wilson, shoemaker, near the Artillery Ground, was\nafflicted for a long time with a severe rheumatic gout, which succeed\ned a nervous fever ; his legs, arms, and shoulders were so swelled,\ninflamed, and\\ve;;k, and so crippled and helpless was he, that he could\nnot even dress or undress himself, and was full of the most excruciat\ning pain. In this deplorable condition he applied to me, and I had\nthe pleasure of making a complete and lasting cure of Mr. Wilson in\nabout a fortnight, so that for many months he has been entirely free\nfrom pain, swelling, and weakness, following his business, as usual,\nwith pleasure and alacrity.\nN\u00b0 115. Mrs. Monkwire, H\u00b0 7, Burleigh-street, Exeter 'Change,\nwas afflicted for seven or eight months with a fever and ague, which\nhad nigh put an end to her existe;*:. At first it recurred every third\nday, but the latter months every day. When she applied to me, she\nwas all over like a person dying of the darkest yellow jaundice ; her\nfeet, legs, and body swelled prodigiously, with a total loss of appe\ntite, and a violent pain at her stomach and about the region of- the\nliver, with every hectic and consumptive symptom. Mrs. Monkwire\nhad not been three weeks however under my care, till she was not\nonly perfectly cured of the ague and fever, but also of the pains,\nswellings, indigestion, and of every other complaint, so that now she\nis fair, blooming, and a healthy and hsppy mother. This great cure\nwas performed by electricity, and the diligent use of my three great\nmedicines, assisted with a couple of emetics.\nN\u00b0 1 16.\n\fC 23 ]\nN' 116. This is to certify all whom it may concern, That 1, Wil\nliam Hefford, being in perfect health and of sound mind, do hereby\nmake voluntarily, and for the public good, the following declaration :\n\u2014That I have been afflicted for upwards of forty years with mon\nstrously swelled and ulcerated legs, and that I was salivated for the\nsame by Cesar Hawkins, Esq; about the year 1737, after which I\nfound myself seemingly well ; but in a little time I was in as bad a\ncondition as before I was salivated, and continued so till the year\n1740, when I was admitted into St, George's Hospital, Hyde Park\nCorner, and where I went through another gentle salivation and con\ntinued seven weeks, when I was discharged seemingly well. But, alas !\nin about three months after I relapsed into my former condition, and\nhave been bad ever since. About two years ago I was so bad, that I\ncould not lie in bed, but have been obliged to sit up three or four\nnights together in a chair, with my legs on another chair, and I was;\nsorely afflicted all last winter ; and about the beginning of September\nlast I was visited with a complicatidn of disorders ; my legs swelled to\nan enormous size, nearly as big as anchovy banels; my whole\nbody was likewise prodigiously swelled ; I was likewise troubled with\na difficulty of respiration, so that I could not lie down in bed with\nout danger of suffocation ; I was likewise afflicted with the rheuma-\ntism, so that I could not without great difficulty cither dress or un\ndress myself. Under all these melancholy circumstances, on the loth\nof September last my daughter, when file saw what a deplorable\ncondition I was in, said, for God's fake, father, do have other ad\nvice ; I pray you now go to Dr. Graham, and hear what he fays.\nAccordingly on the nth of September I went to Dr. Graham, and\nasked him whether he thought he could be of any service to me under\nmy present melancholy condition. After looking very stedfastly at\nme, he told me he believed he could, and ordered a gentle operation\nof electricity, telling me at the same time if I found any benefit to\ncome again, recommending too a steady course of his wonderful me\ndicines, to be taken according to his directions.\u2014By these means I\nfound great and immediate relief; so that by the powerful influence\nof his most precious medicines, and being electrified about twenty\ntimes, all the above complaints are happily and completely removed.\nAnd I hereby declare, that I am in as good a state of health and free\nfrom paiti, as I could wish, and that I have no other motive in mak\ning this declaration, but my humble and unfeigned thanks to Almighty\nGod, and grateful acknowledgments to Dr. Graham, for his humane\nand benevolent behaviour and attention to me during this very great\nand unexpected cure.\nJan. 17th 1 78 1.

Mrs. M. Bellis, in Castle-street, Long Acre, about a year\nago was seized with a severe rheumatic gout. When slie applied at\nthe Temple of Health, she was afflicted with a violent pain in her\nleft side night and day, and her feet and legs were monstrously\nswelled. Mrs Bellis could neither stoop nor dress herself; she met,\nhowever, with a speedy cure from my excellent medicines, &c.\nN\u00b0 118. The following letter is an obliging and grateful acknow\nledgment of a very extraordinary cure in a deep and confirmed\nconsumption, in the case of an amiable and very respectable\nyoung lady in Houghton-street, Clare- market.\nTo Dr. GRAHAM.\nSIR!\nLast autumn I was seized with that violent eruption called St. An\nthony's Fire, in my breast, which soon run down my arm, swelling it\nand my hand to the most enormous size, and attended with the most\nexcruciating pain, especially when touched. Notwithstanding the\nmedicines and applications of my apothecary and a very eminent\nphysician, this terrible disorder degenerated into a gangrene; and the\nmortification and purple blackness of my hand, inside and outside,\nwhen I first had your advice, was very far advanced. Indeed, I ex\npected at least to have lost my hand and arm, if not my life. Your\napplications, however, relieved me immediately ; and in a few weeks,\nby electricity and your electrical \u00e6ther, you made a perfect cure, and\nrestored me to the intire use of both hand and arm.\nEarly in the spring L was seized, in consequence of a severe cold,\n.with a constant fever, heats, cold, restlessness, and inceffmt cough\ning. My breast felt raw and fore ; I became very hoarse, and I spit\nprodigious quantities of phlegm, and at length corrupted matter.\nMy appetite and spirits were gone ; I was reduced to a mere skeleton ;\nmy legs and feet swelled at night and towards morning ; by the\nconstant coughing in the night time I was melted down, and re\nduced to the lowest degree of weakness by cold chilly sweats ; in a\nword, I was thought by all my friends to be so far gone in a deep\n.consumption, as to be intirely beyond the reach of medicine. En\ncouraged, however, by the great cure you had performed on my\nhand, I applied to you, and I with the g-eatest pleasure and gratitude\ndeclare, that in less than six weeks by your three excellent medicines,\nespecially I think by your \u00e6ther, balsam, and your healing nourishing\nherbs, I am now perfectly cured of the cough, spitting, fever, &c.\nI have recovered my flesh, colour, natural sleep, and spirits ; and in\nshort, that I have recovered as good health and strength as I ever be-\nfoie enjoyed.\u2014I give you full liberty, Sir, to publish my extraordi\nnary cure, in order that others afflicted in like manner may know\nwhere to meet with certain relief.\nI shall always remain, Sir, your obedient,\nAt Mrs. Thornton's, atKj mQft 0bliged servant and well-wisher,\n*a\u00a3SZ?u\u00a3Z' ELIZABETH DAVIS.\nN' 119.\n\fC 25 ]\nN\u00b0 1 19. Major Forbes of the 29th regiment, about three years ago,\nafter a long and severe complaint which had preyed a good deal on\nhis nerves and spirits, was struck in an instant with an universal dead\npalsy, which intirely deprived him of the use of all his limbs. The\nmajor's head was particularly affected ; his speech was taken away ;\nhe could neither articulate words, nor connect ideas ; and his me\nmory, and indeed ail the faculties of both body and mind were lost.\nHe was confined to his bed for nigh two years, unable to turn or to\nhelp himself on any occasion. In this deplorable, this hopeless and\nhelpless condition, did this worthy and truly respectable gentleman\napply to me. His legs were swelled to a monstrous size ; he was agi\ntated and debilitated with spasms and convulsions ; and his appetite\nand spirits were extremely bad. The advice of the best physicians in\nLondon, and the virtues of the most powerful medicines, had hi\ntherto availed nothing ; but the major finding considerable benefit\nfrom the very first electrical \u00e6thereal operation at the Temple of\nHealth, wifely and resolutely persisted in the repetition of these\nbalmy, genial, and invigorating influences, and in taking my three\ngreat medicines regularly and in very large quantities for about six\nweeks ; and this brave officer has now recovered the use of all his\nlimbs, his speech, and indeed of all his faculties. At the end of the\nfirst three weeks he joyfully hung up both his crutches as most ho\nnourable trophies in the Temple of Health ; he now eats, drinks,\nsleeps, and walks pretty well ; is free from all pain, weakness, and\nfrom the swellings of his legs, and proposes very soon to join his\nregiment, and to serve, he says, with double ardour and thankful\nness, his country and his most gracious King i\u2014That the above\nis a true state of my cafe, and of the great benefit I have received\nby Dr. Graham's medicines and electrical operations, is attested\nBY ME,\nJOHN FORBES.\nAs it is impossible in the narrow bounds allotted for this Pamphlet,\nto insert the hundredth part of the number of cures performed at\nthe Temple of Health, I will conclude this multitude of astonish\ning and well-authenticated cures, with exhibiting the General\nMonthly State of my Medical Practice at the Temple of Health in\nLondon, as it appears upon the books for April last.\nPerfectly cured, or very considerably relieved, of violent colds,\nsevere coughs, and asthmatic complaints, 22 ; of consumptions, some\nof which in the most advanced stages, 17 ; of the rheumatism, 34;\nof nervous disorders, especially stow fevers and low spirits, proceeding\nfrom weakness, relaxations, and irritations, 48 ; of the dead palsy,\n5 ; of persons crippled and lame with pain, swellings or contractions\nin the joints of their hands or feet, from the gout or rheumatic gout,\n16; of recent veneceal injuries, 38; of inveterate and consumed\nvenereal diseases, o ; of weaknesses, relaxations, tremors, and low\nD spirits,\n\fC 26 ]\nspirits, from neglect, bad treatment, repeated infections, or too much\nmercury in venereal complaints, 13 ; of debility, and of wretchedness\nof body and of mind, occasioned by j'onthful imprudencies, excessive\ndrinking, or unnatural strainings and exertions, 8 ; of severe head-:\naches, and of windy spasmodic complaints in the stomach and bowels,\n12; of that disease which is cured by the touch of kings ever since the\npriests communicated to them the power of working miracles, the firo-\nphula, 4; of thefistula, piles, and old scorbutic sores, 9 ; of fiery, itch\ning scorbutic eruptions, some of which had degenerated into an univer\nsal leprous scurf, 23; of convulsion and hysteric fits, 8 ; of the dropsy\nand cold swellings of the legs, 6 ; of scarlet and spotted fevers, 5 ; of\nthe ague, 7; ot lunacy, 2; of the confirmed jaundice, and biliary-\npains and obstructions, 1 1 ; of the gravel, habitual stranguries, and\nobstructions in the ,urethra, 7 ; of mortifications far advanced, 2 ; of\nthe ulcerated sore throats, and loss of voice, 5 ; of the small-pox and\nmeasles, 4 ; of stoppages dr rising in the stomach or throat, 4 ; of\nworms, 9; of deafness and noise in the ears, 34; of sore eyes, dim\nness of sight, and blindness, 8 ; of barrenness, 3 ; of the diseases pe\nculiar to women, 37; and of decayed and worn- out constitutions, by\nage, fretting, or free living, 5 ; rejected at first sight as incurable, 42 ;\ndismissed as incurable, after a lhort trial, 14 ; dismissed for neglect, 8.\nN.

GPvAHAM, for the public good, as well as for his owrj\n_} honour and emolument, thinks it his duty to depart\nfrom what is called the regular mode, by thus publishing to the world\n(having first obtained the permission of the respective parties) a great\nmultitude of attested cures, as important and extraordinary as any\nthat ever were performed in any age or country 'since the creation of\nthe world, and which have now effectually removed every doubt or\nsuspicion in even the most incredulous mind, and have shewn, to the\nfullest conviction of every reasonable being, the infinite superiority,\nsafety, 'and certainty of Dr. Graham's discoveries and improvements in\ntut lug and eradicating most diseases and weaknesses to which the\n' <.\u2022 \" ' '' '\"' ' , ' -'. human\n\fC 27 ]\nhuman body is liable ; and of restoring health and cheerful serenity\nof body and of mind, even when all other human means have proved\nineffectual. From the fame benevolent motives, therefore, which\ninduced the worthy persons whose names and residence are above in\nserted ; namely, that the afflicted may know where they may me:t\nWith relief, Dr. Graham adds this public notice, which is particularly\naddressed to the friends op persons apparently at. the\npoint of death, and to every individual who labours under any\nkind of complaint or infirmity which has resisted the ordinary reme\ndies.\u2014To such, in whatever station of life, this advertisement is ad\ndressed ; but more especially to the charitably disposed Christian\u2014to\nthe affectionate parent\u2014 the dutiful child\u2014the fond companion\u2014aud\nthe tender\u2014the anxious friend.\nThe above cafes, and to recapitulate briefly those which Dr.- Gra\nham has been the most remarkably successful in curing, are the fol\nlowing :\u2014viz. Violently dangerous fevers, particularly scarlet, putrid,\nand nervous ones\u2014excruciating pain and imminent danger from the\ngout in the head or stomach\u2014apoplexy\u2014putrid ulcerated throats-\nstone or gravel\u2014-cflammations of the brain, lungs, bowels, or blad\nders-obstinate and confirmed VENEREAL complaints, from repeated\ninfections and irregularities, or from having been neglected, trifled\nwith, or improperly treated with that deadly poison mercury, severe\npurging, &c.\u2014stomach and bowels complaints\u2014weaknesses, total sup\npressions of urine too \u2014relaxing, sinking ; and the more immediately\ndangerous female complaints\u2014Jits, spasms, and convulsions,\nespecially in children and young people\u2014the measles, small-pox,\nmortifications, nervous and consumptive weaknesses\u2014immoderate\nfluxes\u2014severe fits of coughing, suffocation, or asthma\u2014acute, bilious,\nend other obstructions\u2014the fever and ague\u2014the dropsy, the dead*\npalsy, but especially recent strokes of the palsy, &c. In these, and\ninmost other diseases, particularly in glandular and white swellings ;\ncomplicated, severe, and wandering rheumatisms ; obstinate scurvies ;\nin blindness and in deafness too, and in most of the disorders of those\nmost precious and most delicate organs the eye and ear, his medicines,\nand gentle \u00e6thereal and electrical applications, produce the most\namazing good effects : they open obstructions, promote a due and\nregular circulation of the blood and spirits, which they sweeten,\npurify, enrich, and animate; nourishing, bracing, and coiling up\nthe nervous system when weakened and relaxed ; overcoming every\ndegree of putrefaction, recruiting decayed strength, and generally\nacting on an exhausted body, like fresh oil poured into an expiring\nlamp. After all, however, Dr. Graham is far from pretending to\nwork miracles or impossibilities. No : he is abundantly sensible of\nthe impossibility of curing many diseases in their advanced and\nconfirmed stages; and of the fallibility and uncertainty of all sub\nlunary things ; all that he contends for is, that his methods of\ntreating diseases are far more powerful, safe, and rational than those in\ngeneral employed by any other physician in the world, and that he often\nsucceeds in curing, effectually and lastingly, diseases internal and exter-\nD 2 nal,\n\fC 28 ]\nnal, when the most celebrated surgeons and physicians, and even\nwhen the more friendly powers of regimen, exercise, and the best\nmineral waters, have failed.\nSo amazingly has his business increased, that he has vow found it\nnecessary, from wotives of humanity more than for his own emolu\nment, to fit up additional apartments, and to receive at any hour of\ntlv.- day such lick and lame persons as cannot afford to give fees for\nadvice ; aud that they are now admitted daily, Sundays excepted,\nfrom eight o'clock in the morning, till eight at night, to whom advice,\nand all necessary medico-electrical operations, &c. are administered\ngratis, in rotation, according to priority of arrival, without respect\nof persons, paying the apothecary for such medicines only (if any) as\ntheir respective cafes require. As the greatest hindrances have arisen\nfrom multitudes crowding, into the Temple of Heaith ! under\nthe pretence of attending sick friends, but merely to gratify their\ncuriosity, by staring at the apparatus, to obviate, therefore, in future,\nthose 'inconveniencies and impertinencies, and that as many diseased\npersons as possible may partake of the salutary effects of this grand\nSystem of Healing ! no poor person whatever,, will be admitted\nwithout a ticket, which must be had of the porter, price half-a crown.\nThis is required only at the first consultation ; for Dr. Graham, on\nreceiving it, gives another ticket gratis, which admits the patient\nduring the whole course of the cure.\u2014No sort of objection, however,\nis made to one friend attending each paiicnt\u2014that being often neces\nsary, as well as decent.\nThe nobility, gentry, and others, in genteel or easy circumstances,\nmust pay a Guinea the first consultation, and at least half-a-guinea\nevery time after. No persons whomsoever, even personages of high\nrank, need expect to be attended at their own houses, unless confined\nto bed by sickness, or to their room through extreme weakness ; and\nfrom those whom he attends at their own houses, two guineas the\nfirst, and one guinea each visit after, is expected. Dr. Graham, for\nreasons of the highest importance to the public, as well as to himself,\nhas a chemical laboratory and a great medicinal cabinet in his own\nhouse ; and in the above fixed Fees, either at home or abroad, every\nexpence attending his advice, medicines, applications, operations, and\ninfluences is included\u2014a few tedious, complex, and expensive opera-\ntions in the great Apollo apartment only excepted. But in cafes\nwhere electricity or attendance are not necessary, and medicines are\nrequired to be taken at home, or when any are sent into the country,\nif they are furnished and prepared by Dr. Graham's chemists and apo\nthecaries, they must be paid for separately.\nBefore he concludes this address, it may not be amiss to fay a\nfew words on the dangerous, and even fatal effects which may be\nproduced by so mighty an agent as the electrical fire, in the hands\nof ignorant and rash people. So very powerful an element cannot\nbe indifferent when applied to the human body ; it must do consider\nable good or considerable harm ; striking instances of both have re\npeatedly\n\fC 29 3\npeatedly fallen under Dr. Graham's observation.\u2014and lie trembles\nwith apprehension for his fellow-creatures, when he fees in almost\nevery street in this great metropolis, a barber\u2014a surgeon\u2014a tooth-\ndrawer\u2014an apothecary\u2014or a common mechanic turned electrical\noperator. How dangerous !\u2014how ridiculous must it be in most\ncafes to venture so curious, so complex, and so delicate a machine a*\nthe human body\", and that too, even when diseased, into such hands\nto be shook, torn, and convulsed with the ignorant and improper\napplication of this awful element !\nFor his own part, he has been taught by reason, and by the most\nattentive observations in innumerable experiments on almost every\nsubstance in Nature, and in a course of practice in the cure of dis\neases, far more extensive than that of perhaps any other man in the\nworld, he has been taught, that all violence is hunful ; that ELEC\nTRICAL SHOCKS OUGHT SELDOM OR NEVER TO BE\nGIVEN ; that partial frictions, sparks, and brushings, with rich me\ndicinal substances charged with electricity, or gently pervading the\nwhole system with a copious tide of that celestial fire, fully im\npregnated with the purest, most subtile, and balmiest parts of medi\ncines, which are extracted by, and flow softly into the blood and\nnervous system, with the electrical fluid, or restorative \u00e6thereal\nessences. In those cases where shocks are absolutely necessary, instead\nof charging bottles lined with tin foil, or other gross, impure, and\nperhaps ariienical metals, his jars are filled with loadstones, sulphur,\nquick-silver, and with the mildest, yet most active medicinal sub\nstances from the animal, mineral, or vegetable kingdoms:\u2014These are\ncharged with the celestial fire, solar vital light, vivifying air, and\nwith the powerful and salutary Effluvia of antimony, aromatic oils,\nPeruvian bark, castor, camphire, musk, ambergrease, the balsams of\njuniper, Peru, Tolu, and Gilead, and the influences of electricity,\nair, \u00e6thereal medicines, and magnetism, thus combined, and positive\nly charged with the pure celestial fire, or with the magnetic effluvium,\nare made to pass through the whole or any particular part of the\npatient's body, giving, in such cafes as require them, a great number\nor quick succession of pleasant little vibratory Shocks, so genial\nand gentle as not to hurt or alarm even an infant. But, as he said\nbefore, he generally prefers the Effluvia of these genial, aromatic,\nbalsamic, antispasmodic substances, or the Effluvia of the magnetic,\naerial, or \u00e6thereal essences, passing silently, sweetly, and insensibly\ninto the body, or confined to the seat or cause of the disease, while\nthe spasmodic tensions and stiffnesses are relaxed\u2014or the relaxed and\ndebilitated tone of the nerves or muscular fibres braced up, or invi\ngorated, as the cafe or constitution requires, with the above, and\nwith properly adapted harmonious vibrations, or musical modulations\nof celestial sounds.\nLest it should be thought that Dr. Graham uses electricity in all\ncafes, he desires to inform the public, that many of his greatest and\nmost extraordinary cures have been done entirely without the asis-\ntanc\u00ab of electricity; and that he makes it an iavamble rule to reject\nthe\n\fC 3\u00b0 J\nthe incurable\u2014and to Inform every patient, or their friends, at first\nfight, whether a perfect cure, or what degree of relief may be ex\npected.\nDr. Graham, after a regular, classical, and medical education of\nmany years, at the justly celebrated university of Edinburgh, and after\nattending to the practice in the best hospitals, and the lectures of the\ngreatest physicians in Loudon, Dublin, &c. became exceedingly dissa\ntisfied at the trifling absurdities and feebleness of what is called the\nregular practice of physic : but animated with the hopes of being\nable to make valuable discoveries, and important improvements in the\ncure of diseases, and for the prolongation of human life, he travelled\ninto various foreign countries, making, in the course of twelve years,\nseveral tours through the continent of Europe, and over the extensive\nprovinces of America ; at length, after gathering and digesting the\nfairest flowers, and the choicest fruits of the sciences, by conversing\nWith and attending to the labours and the lectures of the most learned\nand most ingenious men in every country through which he passed )\nafter investigating the nature and properties of the various natural\nproductions, and making the most accurate chymical analyses of the\nmost celebrated mineral waters in Europe; he returned to Britain,\njmd after sitting tip, with infinite labour and expence, the most pow\nerful, most useful, and most magnificent medical apparatus that ever\nwas in the world, he has now practised near two years in the metro\npolis of his native country, and of the world ! with the greatest ho\nnour and emolument to himself, and to the greatest benefit and ad-\nVantage of thousands of his fellow-creatures of every rank and deno\nmination, who had laboured under pains and diseases which the best\nregular practitioners, and the most powerful medicines in common use,\ncould neither cure tior alleviate.\nThe fame and emoluments which Dr. Graham, in consequence of\nhis successes in the cure of diseases, is honoured with, have long\nsince placed him in a sphere which is an object of envy to the\nselfish and narrow-minded part of the faculty; but which neither\nenvy, jealous artifices, nor their illiberal, false, and wicked represen\ntations, insinuations, and libels of theatrical buffoons, or of rascally\navaricious editors of newspapers have been able to remove him from.\nLet them continue to act\u2014to print, and to publish whatever their avari\ncious and diabolical nature prompts them to. Dr. Graham never has, nor\neverwill take the leastnotice, oranswer^oneof them. No : he looksdown\nupon them all with pit}', or with smiles of sovereign\u2014of ineffable con\ntempt!\u2014What !\u2014shall the genial\u2014the life-giving sun cease to mine,\nbecause his nature and powers are not understood, or properly valued\nby the generality of mortals, or because his beams offend the weak or\ndistorted eyes of those foul animals\u2014those vile, venomous reptiles\nwhich assassinate and devour in the dark ? Dr. Graham has at least\nthe negative consolation, that those villainous and lying represented\nof things which concern him, cannot treat him worse than they have\ndone his betters\u2014even the FIRST, most respectable, most innocent,\nand\n\fI 3i 1\nand even the most sacred characters in the British dominions. The\nliberal and enlightened few\u2014the discerning public, can readily\ndistinguish true merit from pretended knowledge.\u2014Facts are incon\ntrovertible\u2014his superiority is universally acknowledged. He balks\nin the sunshine of wealth and honour. He rejoices in the applause\nof the candid and of the learned world\u2014he exults in the testimony of\nhis own conscience !\u2014in the approbation of his own heart ! \u2014and as\nwreaths obtained without opposition confer no honour, he cordially\nhas adopted the following motto\u2014Magnum iter ascendo, fed dat mihj\ngloria vires !\nIn order to remove cfeUually every unfavourable impression\nwhich the jealous or envious insinuations of the faculty or their\nfriends, alarmed at Dr. G.'s unprecedented Fame and\nSuccess, may have created in the minds of those who are unac\nquainted with Dr. Graham, and his valuable discoveries and im\nprovements ; and to demonstrate to the world at large,-the infinite\nsuperiority of his peculiar modes of treating diseases, he will continue\nfor another year to attend at their own home, patients in severe\nACUTE diseases, when given over for death by any other, even by\nthe most celebrated apothecary, surgeon, or physician, without any\nexpence whatever, either for attendance, advice, or medicines, (the\nfirflfee only excepted) if his endeavours to preserve life, under God !\nprove ineffectual. When restored to health his gratuity shall, as\nvisual, be regulated by the generosity or circumstances of the patient.\nNo ordinary or trifling case will be attended to: THE ABOVE is\nCONFINED TO THOSE \u2014 AND TO THOSE ALONE, WHO ARE\nTHOUGHT TO BE NEAR DEATH IN SEVERE ACUTE DISEASES.\nSeldom, very seldom a day passes, but he has the blessedness of\neasing excruciating pain, and of snatching from the grave one or\nmore sick persons, even when struggling in the agonies of death,\nand efren after they have been abandoned by the most celebrated\nPhysicians. Indeed, so very amazing, so unprecedented has been the\nsuccess which has attended his practice, that not more than three or\nfour persons have died in the whole course or circuit of his practice\nduring the last two years\u2014of the multitudes who come or are\nbrought every day to his house\u2014or of those whom he has been feat\nfor to attend, when near death, at their own habitations. While he\nassures the pubiic of the above fact, he defies the whole world to\ndisprove the truth of it. Such success is an honour which few other\nPhysicians can boast\u2014a pleasure which very few have experienced:\u2014\u2022\nnor, than the above, can any thing so effectually demonstrate the\ninfinite superbri y of his methods of treating diseases, especially as\nit is well known, that for several years past he seldom ha; had less\nthan one hundred persons every day under his care, and often more\nthan even double that number.

R. Dr. GRAHAM, on account of the very great increase of bis\npractice in the cure of diseases, bas been under the necessity of\ndiscontinuing the exhibition of the Medico Electrical Appa-\nra.us in the day-time.\nThe\n\f^^\n\\\\\nC 4i 3\nThe design of Dr. GRAHAM's CELESTIAL BED being misun\nderstood, requires explanation, lest the public through ignorance or\nprejudice, should be disappointed of the benefit of so ingenious and\nuseful a discovery.\nThe want of children so much lamented in many noble families,\nand indeed by all married people, arises from corporeal, mental, or\naccidental defects. The corporeal defects are a laxity or debility of\nthe nervous system, and a consequent acrimony of the juices which\nactuate that system, an indisposition of the parts or (which most fre\nquently happens) obstructions. The mental defects are want of cou-\nxa Jh the male side, or of imagination on the female. The acciden-\nta^Qfuses are, when a lively vivacious woman is married to an inert,\ninactive man, or, vice versa. Electricity is the most powerful engine\nor influence in Nature to remedy these several effects : it gives a tone to\nthe lax fibres\u2014it corrects the acrimony of the juices by increasing the\nperspiration, strengthens the animal powers, and effectually removes\nobstructions.
