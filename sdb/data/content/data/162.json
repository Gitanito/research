She was educated at the Ursuline Convent in Ilford and later Woodford High School for Girls. She won a scholarship to Somerville College, Oxford taking mathematics as her main subject, later stating that she would have chosen physics if she had known she could have switched.1 &nbsp;In 1960, she was awarded a degree by the Oxford faculty of Literae Humaniores for a thesis entitled \u2018An Enquiry into Some States of Consciousness and their Physiological Foundation\u2019. In 1996 she received a DPhil degree at the same faculty for a thesis on causation and the mind-body problem. She is an honorary research fellow at the University of Liverpool\u2019s philosophy department.  Psychical Research\n\nGreen was awarded a Perrott-Warrick studentship for psychical research and in 1957 was appointed research officer at the Society for Psychical Research (SPR), holding the post for three years. There she carried out a detailed analysis of descriptions of inexplicable spontaneous experiences obtained by the SPR in a public appeal.2  Institute of Psychophysical Research\n\nIn 1961, Green founded the Institute of Psychophysical Research in Oxford, aided by George Joy, an ex-president of the SPR, and Arthur Strutt, son of the physicist Robert Strutt.3 In 1964, the institute was granted charitable status under the direction of Green and psychologist Charles McCreery. It aims to encourage \u2018research and experimental investigation into paranormal phenomena and related mind-matter problems in the physical and biological sciences and in particular in the fields of psychology electro-physiology and mental health\u2019.4  Books and Studies\n\nIn 1963, Green reported an exploratory study to determine the influence of factors such as age, sex, social class and occupation on ESP ability, using subjects recruited among viewers of a television programme.5 A later study, with magazine readers as subjects, probed the possible relationship of birth order and family size with ESP ability.6\n\nGreen is best-known for her published work on out-of-body experiences (OBEs), lucid dreams and apparitions.\n\nIn Lucid Dreams (1968) and Out-of-Body Experiences (1968), Green offered anecdotal descriptions, compared the two types of experiences (which she concluded were philosophically indistinguishable), and discussed their varying characteristics.\n\nApparitions (1975), written in collaboration with Oxford psychologist Charles McCreery, quotes several hundred first-hand accounts of encounters with ghostly figures, animals and even objects. &nbsp;The authors conclude that some, or even all, apparitions are \u2018metachoric\u2019 - meaning that not just the apparitional figure, but the whole of the visual field, is \u2018temporarily hallucinatory\u2019.7\n\nThe Decline and Fall of Science (1977), as described on its cover, is an \u2018attack on the attitudes of the contemporary scientific and intellectual establishment to psychical phenomena and their investigation\u2019.8 &nbsp;In 1998 Green founded the Oxford Forum, an association of independent academics, to oppose what she believed to be an increasing ideological bias in mainstream academia, and to be a centre for the expression of dissenting ideas in philosophy, psychology and other academic fields.\n\nGreen continues to publish articles and posts comments in her blog Celia Green \u2013 notes from an exiled academic.
