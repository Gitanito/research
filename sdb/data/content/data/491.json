H. Salter. The Report will\nbe published in full in the forthcoming Part of the Proceedings.\nL 1263 CASE.\nAn Apparition of the Living.\nThe foUomng case of aii apparition of the living has reached\nus through Sir Oliver Lodge, to whom the percipient related\nher experience in a letter which we print below. By the per-\ncipient's request her name and address are withheld, and she\nis referred to here as Mrs. Richardson. Her true name and\naddress are known to the Society. Mrs. Richardson's first letter\nto Sir Oliver Lodge was as follows :\n\u2014\nSeptember 24, 1924.\nWill you pardon the liberty 1 am taking in asking you for your\nopinion on the following incident ? I know nothing of Spiritualism,\nand have no opinions whatever on the subject\u2014for or against\n\u2014\nbut the following incident has made me think.\nMy half brother (40) and self quarrelled last Saturday, and after-\nwards were greatly upset, as such a thing never occurs. At about\n7 or 8 o'clock the next morning my brother apparently passed\nquickly through my unopened bedroom door across the room, and\ndisappeared into a corner. I was lying wide awake, so it was no\ndream. The door was closed, and he apparently passed through\nit without it being opened\u2014glancing sorrowfully at me in bed as\n\f4 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jan., io25\nhe quickly passed\u2014with something in his left hand, and dressed\nin a blue flannel suit, with no hat.\nI mentioned the matter to him at lunch (when he was wearing\na brown suit), and he told me that he went out about that time\nto early service with a prayer book in his hand, atid in his blue\nflannel suit, and had been greatly troubled during the night over\nour quarrel, which had not been made up, but was not frightfully\nserious.\nWe occupy a large house here, he having one part and myself\nthe other, but he did not have to pass my bedroom door on going\nout to early service.\nWill you tell me if it is possible for the spirit of a living\nperson to appear to another, or to leave the body of that person\nwhilst he is sleeping ? I was not at all frightened, but a\nlittle startled, when I saw the door had remained closed, and he\napparently came through it. E. M. Richardson.\nTo this letter Sir Oliver Lodge replied, suggesting that the\napparition Avas due to \"a telepathic impression,\" and asking\nwhether the percipient would allow her experience to be sent\nto the S.P.R. She replied as follows :\n\u2014\nSeptember 26, 1924.\nThank you so much for your oj^inion on my strange experience.\nI quite follow and understand your explanation and agree with it,\nalthough the apparition and facial expression of kindness and\nconcern was so very real. The only change seemed to be that he\nlooked stouter than he is, but my explanation of that is that I\nhad always told him he looked stouter in that blue flannel suit, so\nthat might have been sub-conscious on my part. Your remark\nthat \" if it is a vivid impression it might produce an auditor^] or\nvisible hallucination \" reminded me of an occasion six years ago\n(when I was ill in bed with depression and subconsciously fretting\nfor my husband, who had gone to Africa), when I distinctly\nheard his voice on the bungalow verandah\u2014no actual sentence\nor remark did I catch, but just heard his voice. A letter arrived\nshortly after, saying on that particular Sunday afternoon he was\ntalking actually on board ship and remarked that he was certain\nsomething was wrong in his home or with his wife. He was very\nanxious all that afternoon. Of course that is only a small instance\n\fJan., 1925 COtSe 5\nof telepathy ; but to those like ourselves, who have never studied\nor thought of these things, they are most interesting.\nI do not mind my case being sent to the S.P.R. if you would\ncare to do so, but only anonymously, of course. My brother, who\nis well known, would not care for any publicity, although he is\nmost impressed. E. M. Richardson.\nSubsequently, Sir Oliver Lodge sent Mrs. Richardson\/ s letters\nto the Editor, ]\\Irs. Salter, who ^vrote to Mrs. Richardson, put-\nting a few additional questions. These questions, together with\nMrs. Richardson's replies, written on November 6, 1924, are\nprinted below :\n\u2014\n(1) You mention that you did not hnow until lunch time that your\nbrother had gone to early service. Had you any reason to think it\nprobable that he ivould go : I mean, was it in accordance with n\nus ual habit of his ?\nAnswer. His usual habit was to go at eleven.\n(2) Had you any reason to think that if he went out early he\nivould be wearing a blue suit ? Did he usually ivear this suit in the\nmornings ?\nAnswer. Only if going on the river.\nMrs. Salter also enquired whether it would be possible to\nobtain from Mrs. Richardson's brother a statement to the efJect\nthat his mind had been dwelling on the quarrel which had\ntaken place, and that at about the time of the experience he\nhad left the house w^earing the suit in which he was seen by\nthe percipient.\nTo this question Mrs. Richardson replied in the negative, but\nstated in her covering letter to Mrs. Salter :\n\u2014\nMy brother, I know, suffered very much from the time of the\nquarrel tiU it was over the next day at lunch. . .\nAlthough it has not been possible to obtain a corroborative\nstatement from the apparent agent, we think the case is worth\nputting on record, as it is a good example of this type of case,\nand the percipient put her own experience on record while the\nevent was still fresh in her mind, only three days after the\napparition. . ^ \u2022\n\f6 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jan., 1925\n\"HEAD-SNAPS.\" \u2022\nWe print below a group of communications received from\nMembers of the Society in which they describe experiences\nanalogous to the \"head-snaps\" which were a frequent feature\nof Mrs. Piper's trance, just before her return to normal con-\nsciousness.\nThe first of these comnnmications was contained in a letter\nwritten by Miss Dallas to Sir Oliver Lodge, thus :\n\u2014\nAugust 17, 1924.\nWhen reading the article by Dr. Alrutz in the July Proceedings\n(Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXXIV., p. 170), I recalled an experience I\nhave sometimes had, and wondered whether it was worth men-\ntioning. ... I do not know the physiological cause of this ex-\nperience. Of course, it may be quite simple.\nI do not very often fall asleep in the day, but when I do, for\na few miuutes, I sometimes am conscious of a curious sensation\nin my head just as I awake. It is\u2014or seems to be\u2014a sound like\nthat of the word shoot\u2014prolonged, and yet not slowly : s h u 1\n1\n(not shut) seems to give a better equivalent. I have sometimes\nremarked that it feels as if a door had been banged just in time !\nAs if I had only come back just in time, been pushed in and the\ndoor banged behind me! .\n-\nOf course, I only describe it so to give some notion of the\nsensation, not as expressing an opinion. I have wondered whether\nit is at all like Mrs. Piper's \" click.\" It is not quite pleasant ; it\nis too abrupt to be pleasant. It may be due to change of blood-\npressure on the brain ?\nI have not had it for some time now ; whether that is because\nI am feeling stronger in health than I did a few years ago, I\ncannot say. I never remember to have had this sensation when\nawaking from ordinary sleep in the morning. H. A. Dallas.\nTo this letter Sir Oliver Lodge replied as follows :\n\u2014\nAugust 18, 1924.\nWhile reading your letter, the snap in Mrs. Piper's head, during\nawaking out of trance, vividly occurred to me\u2014as I saw later it\nhad to you also. She sometimes had two of these snaps succes-\nsively, and each marked a definite, and so to speak discontinuous,\nchange in the return of her normal self. The return was mainly\n\fJa.\\., 1925 \u2022 '\nHead-8naps\n\"\n7\ngradual, but with these one or two sudden steps or drops, as it\nwere, into or towards normal consciousness.\nI should judge that most likely a physiological explanation can\nbe given, but whether it is due to the sudden uniting of nerve\ncentres, or to the breakdown of some inhibitory obstacle, or, as\nyou say, to a sudden change of blood pressure, I do not know.\nAnd it could not be a thing easy to make experiments on. I\nimagine it might be described as the restoration of the normal\nconnexions to the conscious part of the brain ; and the suddenness\ndoes not seem to me so much like a change of blood pressure as\nto a closing of a gap in the nerves or nerve centres, which in the\ntrance state may be slightly dislocated, using the term \" disloca-\ntion \" in an exact sense. Mrs. Piper expected us to hear the\nsnap. 1 am not aware that anyone ever did. But I think it is\nmore than a subjective sensation ; I think there must be a physical\n-cause for it. . . . Oliver Lodge.\nWe have also received a re]3ort of a similar experience from\njVIiss Kelly, who writes thus : \u2014 ^\n.\n'\n'\nAugust 17, 1924.\nIn reading the July issue of the Proceedings, Part XCL, I have\nbeen much interested in the paper by Dr. Alrutz, and would like\nto tell him that I have myself frequently experienced Mrs. Piper's\n\" Head-snaps \" !\nI am not a trance-medium, and am aware of my surroimdiugs,\n\u00abven when \" under control.\"\nI cannot at all produce the condition at will, during which I\nfeel the \" click,\" and I never know when it will come ; but when\nit does, it is loud enough, to me, to make me jump, and I feel\nother people must hear it ! No one ever does.\nI had felt it, and wondered if it was a usual sensation in\nmediumship, before I read anything about Mrs. Piper's trances.\nFrom Dr.. Alrutz's remarks it does not seem to be a common experience,\nand therefore I think I ought to record my own. I do not get it after\nautomatic or inspirational writing, nor the use of an ouija board,\nbut I do after a circle, when I have been under control\n\"\nor when I have felt myself to have been withdrawn from my\nbody, and not alicays even then. . . .\nEleanor B. Kelly.\n\f8 Journal of Society for Psychical ReseavcJi Jan., 1925\nWe have also received a report of a single similar experience\nfrom Dr. Hereward Carrington, thus :\n\u2014\nAwjust 22, 1924.\nDr. Sydney Alrutz's discussion of Mrs. Piper's \" head-snapping\n\"\nwas particularly interesting to me, for the reason that I once (and\nonly once) experienced the same thing myself. I have given a\nbrief account of the incident in my Problems of Psychical Research,\nEnglish edition, pp. 144-45. This note was appended to the\nchapter giving an account of my Piper sittings, in 1908, and it\nwill be noted that the head -snapping incident occurred at the\nend of my own sittings also (v. pp. 122, 143).\nWith reference to my own experience, one fact of considerable\ninterest should perhaps be mentioned, which I did not sufficiently\nemphasize. At that time, especially, I used to awaken instan-\ntaneously, and be in immediate possession of all my faculties\n\u2014\nunlike many persons who \" come to themselves \" very slowly. On\nthis particular occasion, however, I felt absolutely dazed upon\nwaking up, and this condition lasted for several seconds, until my\nhead \" snapped \"\u2014when I was instantaneously restored to full\nconsciousness. Needless to say, I was extremely interested in the\nexperience, and made note of it at the time. The \" snap \" seemed\nto take place in the very centre of my brain, and though soft\nseemed to be distinctly audible to my own ears. I have ever\nsince that experience been enabled to sympathise with Mrs. Piper\nin her amazement that her sitters do not hear the \"snap\"' too\nHereward Carrington.\nCOKKESPONDENCE.\nTo the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.E.^\nMadam,\u2014May I contribute to the correspondence on \" Brain\nand Speech \" some iacts which have come under my own observa-\ntion with regard to the inhibition or enervation of the motor\n1 Mrs. M'Connel, the writer of tliis letter, is the mother of the young air-\nman, Lieutenant David M'Connel, an apparition of whom at the time of his\ndeath was reported in the Journal, Vol. XIX., p. 76, and again in Mrs.\nSidgwick's paper on \" Phantasms of the Living,\" Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXXII.,\np. 152. Since Lieutenant M'Connel's death, Mr. and Mrs. M'Connel have had\na considerable number of sittings with mediums, at which good evidence has\nbeen obtained.\n\fJan., 1925\n9\ncentres in the ordinary brain, and its application to success of\ncommunication ?\nI am a biologist, and, as such, interested in what we may call\nthe recrudescence of the belief that pre-natal influences can affect\nthe mentality of the offspring. This premise has been considered\nalso by psycho-analysts in tracing the reason of \" wounds ^'\nor\napparent mental obstruction, resulting in morbid conditions in the\nadult, to the mental impression received upon the brain of the\nmother of the subject during gestation, the announcement of\nthe cause to the subject having released him from the thraldom\nof this brain association. '\n.\nIt is in the use of associations that we get the most satisfactory\ncommunication ; memory persists, and thought continues as the\nacting communicating parts of the person passed over; and if the\nwaves of thought-carrying memories can reach a receiving depot,\nas it were, here, in a brain having a corresponding memory, a\npath of communication is made where there is no obstruction to\nsuccess. It would seem, however, by our own experience that it\nIS not necessary to success that the recorder of the seance should\nhave the memory or association in her mind, but that there must\nbe a corresponding memory in someone's mind on the earth plane\nwhich can be discovered by controls and used. Memories which\nare capable of being put into pictorial form, or words which have\nalready been uttered or written, are the most easy of communi-\ncation.\nNames are difficult to obtain, I think because they cannot be\n'\npictorialized. But we have had great success with our names. A\nlady for whom David was working as one of the controls of her\nmedium sat with another medium at times, a long distance away,\nand this medium gave to the lady descriptions and names of\npersons who had already presented themselves without names to\nFeda. The lady was a stranger ; she did not know what the\nnames meant ;\nbut there seems to have been some association of\nplace which made it easy for these spirits to give their names,\nthere being no mental obstruction to their doing so either in the\nmind of the medium or the recorder.\nInhibitions are more difficult to understand in relation to the\nbrain and to the non-success of communications. During the last\nyear I have had a little grandson to care for ; he was born in\nwar time; my son's wife kept his coming as a surprise; she had\n\f10 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jan., 1925\nplanned a telegram on the event of his birth, announcing the birth\nof a son to those most concerned. This idea of hers rather ob-\nsessed her. The child was born tongue-tied. He left my home in\nEngland a fine-looking boy of two years ; when I reached Cali-\nfornia two years later, I was sad to find that he was small and\ndelicate, and could only say a few disconnected words. No\nAttention had been paid to the tongue, and he had adjusted him-\nself to life without talking ; he was very intelligent, knew the parts\nof a motor-car as they fitted and the use of tools, and loved\nother children and dumb creatures. After the operation there\nwas still not any attempt to talk ; tools he knew the use of, but\ncould not name ; but one day I got him a new tool and said,\n\" This is a gimlet.\" Immediately he said \" gimlet.\" His little\nvocabulary consisted of the following :\n\u2014\" Babben, his sister ;\nMummy ;\nDaddy ; come here, please ; wat's that ; here tis ; wat\nfor.\" His sister said she understood a kind of jargon he spoke,\nbut we could make nothing of it. I feared some mechanical defect\nin the organs of speech ; but one day he sat and looked at David's\npicture as a little boy and said, \" Grannie, he can't get out,\"\nand then he said, \" upstairs to the telephone.\" The telephone at\nhis own home was downstairs. One day a friend of mine gave\nhim a word to say, and he said, I can't say that ; I am tongue-\ntied, you know.\" One day sitting alone he said, \" I hate the very\nsight of her\n'\"\n; this was something he had heard coming from the\nsubconscious. If one tried to make him say anything, some\nmental obstruction arose and he could not do it ; the little face\n-would work, and he would stutter in trying hard to say the word.\nWhat he gave forth of speech had to come without conscious\n\u2022effort. He has lately had an operation for adenoids, and I think\nit has had the effect of removing in some measure the mental\ninhibition ; I hear he is now making sentences for himself. He\nasked me \" wat for ?\n\" and I said, \" Well, you can talk now, you\ninow.\"\nOur experience with mediums has shown us that our conscious\nTaind can cause inhibition. In this experience of the child one has\nthe possible cause of inhibition by the mental attitude of the\nTQOther, the unfortunate mechanical defect, the acceptation of the\ncondition of not being able to talk by the mind, resulting in a\nquiescent state, which allows the subconscious only to function\nwhen anything is said, and then the brain storm and inhibition\ni\n\fJan., 1925 Correspondence 11\nset up by an attempt to alter the accepted quiescent state when\nconscious effort was urged bj another mind.\nThe mind of the medium is in the quiescent state, the thoughts\nof the communicator are being passed over her brain as an in-\nstrument by means of the power of the control. Any sudden\nquestion or alteration in the direction of the association of thought\ncalls for conscious effort and sets up a brain storm in the medium,\nand causes obstruction in the harmonious relation which has been\nuntil this minute existing between four minds : that of the com-\nmunicator, the control, the medium, and the recipient. At first\nwhen communicating with David I did not realize this ; there was\none person I longed to hear of through Feda, but I could get\nnothing about him. ]\\Iy own mind was in the way. At last I\nasked about him. Then Feda got a wrong name\u2014\" Ned \"\n\u2014\nwhich was not the name at all, but when she spoke of Ned after-\nwards I always got the right man. David did not correct her as\nhe had done in the pronunciation of French. I had myself set\nup an inhibition by my conscious longing and effort either in the\nmind of Feda or that of the medium.\nThe recipient must be willing to receive what is offered, and to\ntake leads, but not to insist or assert.\nWe have found that Feda is aware of a possible inhibition. One\nday she came to me while I was sitting with another medium\nand said that she and \" Mrs. Gladys \" (Feda's own name for Mrs.\nLeonard) would not be able to give me a good sitting, as someone\nhad impressed her brain too much. I did not believe this, but it\nwas very evident at my next sitting, some time after. When David\ncame through at last by direct voice, he said it had been difficult\nto get past Mrs. Leonard's brain, but he made satisfactory ex-\nplanation. It was no fault of the medium, but only showed a\npeculiar sensitiveness causing a contest in the brain, because know-\nledge had been imparted to her in her conscious condition which\nmight possibly come through when she was in trance. It was\nextremely interesting that Feda knew what the result might be of\na few inadvertent words.\n- At one of our sittings Feda told me of a man who had come\nand sat like an image and got nothing. Why she told me I do\nnot know, unless perhaps she felt that I might try to tell him\nhow to receive his messages. I did not know him at all, but had\nheard of him ; he had come all the way from South Africa to\n\f12 Jotirnal of Society for Psychical Research Jan., 1925\nvisit Mrs. Leonard in order to try to take home with him comfort\nto a woman's sorrowing heart\u2014but he failed. He attended the\nseance and behaved as if he were a stone. The demand of his\nconscious mind for evidence set up an inhibition in the brain of\nthe medium which it was impossible to penetrate. He might just\nas well have filled his physical ears with cotton wool ; the evidence\nhe asked for could not be given, because he did not imderstand\nor accept the methods by which the mental associations could be\ngiven to him. I tried to reach him, but he had gone back to\nAfrica.\nFeda has come to me in California with David through a ouija\nmedium ; she said that she and David had an appointment to-\ngether, so could not stay long. She called me \" Mrs. David.\"\nThis was a name given to me by my husband's people as the wife\nof a younger son. It had caused some confusion, because I had\na good deal of public work to do in Queensland, Australia, my\nhome, and I was better known by my full name ; also the wife of\nthe Archdeacon was named Mrs. David, and we sometines got\none another's letters. Years afterwards Feda teasingly called me\nMrs. David ; no one in England had done so. It is these little\nincidents which make for our belief in survival.\nMay M'Connel.\nREVIEW.\nToivards The Stars. By H. Dennis Bradley. T. Werner Laurie.\n1924. 7s. 6d. .\nThe author of this book has been peculiarly fortunate in having\nreceived from the outset of his investigations evidence which has\nentirely and at once convinced him of the survival by individuals\nof bodily death and of the ability of these individuals to com-\nmunicate with the living. \u2022\n' \u2022\nThis conviction is so definite that he is led to adopt towards\nthose investigators who have been less fortunate a tone which is\nsomewhat dictatorial or even abusive, and they are likely on that\naccount to feel rather repelled by his writings and to under-\nestimate the importance of the evidence which he brings forward.\nWhat is of most interest to English investigators is his account\nof his numerous sittings with the American medium, George\nValiantine, who has not up to the present been very much heard\n\fJan., 1925 Review 13\nof in this country. Valiantine is what is known among spiritualists\nas a \" direct voice \" medium. That is to say, it is claimed that\nthrough his mediumship discarnate spirits are enabled to materialize\nthe vocal organs which are necessary to enable them to carry\non direct conversations with the sitters, and that they in fact\ndo so without making use of the vocal organs of the medium,\nwho can sometimes be heard speaking at the same time as the\nspirit. In the investigation of such a medium there are evidently\ntwo quite distinct problems involved : one concerned with the\nmethod of production of the voices, and the other with the evi-\ndential material provided by what the voices utter ; and Mr.\nBradley wisely decided to concentrate his investigation on the\nsecond of these problems, since this had the more interest for him,\nalthough he is fully convinced that the voices are not proceeding\nfrom the medium's lips. The arguments for and against this belief\nmay be briefly summarised as follows :\n\u2014\nFor.\n(a) The voices are heard proceeding from various parts of the\nroom remote from the position of the medium and including\nthe ceiling and the floor.\n(b) Mr. Bradley and other sitters claim that the voices are\nreadily recognizable in tone and expression in a way which\nwould be impossible to imitate.\nic) The voice of the medium is said to have been heard speaking\nat the same time as the \" spirit voice.\"\nAgainst.\n(d) In the course of an investigation by the Scientific American\nthe investigators claimed to shew that the medium was\nnot occupying his chair at the times when voices were\nheard from other parts of the room.\n(e) The megaphone or \" trumpet,\" which is usually employed in\nthese as in other \" direct voice \" sittings, is stated (but\nnot by Mr. Bradley) to have been found at the close of a\nsitting to be warm near the mouthpiece, as if it had been\nheld in the hand, and to have contained condensed moisture\ninside.\nMr. Bradley's account, however, deals more with the content of\ntheir utterances than with their method, and adds to the literature\nof survival a contribution which is of real and permanent value.\n\f14 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jan., 192*\nHis first sitting took place in June 1923 by the invitation of Mr..\nDe Wyckoff. It is stated that Valiantine was wearing luminous-\nwristlets by which he was located throughout the sitting, and in\nthe course of it Mr. Bradley carried on for fifteen minutes a\nconversation with a voice purporting to be that of his sister\nAnnie who had died ten years before. The important points t&\nnotice are :\n\u2014\n{a) The voice was not whispered but fully audible.\n(6) Every word was heard by all the others present.\n(f) \" Her voice on earth was soft and beautifully modulated.\nI have never met any woman who spoke in the same odd\nway.\"\n\" When she [i.e. the voice] addressed me, she said sayings in her\nown characteristic manner. Every little peculiarity of in-\ntonation was reproduced.\"\"\n((\/) Mr. Bradley is confident that no one present could know that he\nhad had a sister who had died ten years previously.\nAt the second sitting his sister again communicated witli him and\nalluded to certain physical phenomena which had occurred in\nMr. Bradley\"s presence when he was alone in his bedroom after\nthe previous sitting, and which he attributed to her agency.\nUnfortunately, he does not state whether he had mentioned these\nto anyone in the interval, but during this sitting he addressed tO'\nher a question regarding her life on earth and received an answer\nwhich he is convinced shewed knowledge of events which were in\nfact known only to himself and her. At this sitting too he heard\nValiantine's voice conversing with De Wyckoff at the same moment\nas the spirit voice was speaking to him, and an example was\nafforded of a further peculiarity of Valiantine's mediumship in a\nconversation carried on in Spanish and in a little known South\nSpain dialect between De WyckofE's cook and a voice claiming ta\nbe that of her husband who had died six months previously.\nThe Spanish conversation was understood and followed by Mr.\nDe Wyckoff, but it is not clear whether he was able to follow the\ndialect.\nAfter these two sittings Mr. Bradley returned to London^ and\nas he does not tell us that he maintained any secrecy about his\nexperiences we must assume that they became more or less\ngenerally known among those interested. They appear to have\nbeen mentioned in the Daily Neivs on soine unspecified date about\n\f,\n\u2014^ J o-.>-i .) . 1 ^\u2014s^i\u2014^TT^i T^^T\nthe end of July 1923, and at about the same time he had an\ninterview with Mrs. M'Kenzie at the British College.\nOn August 28th Mr. and Mrs. Bradley had an anonymous sitting\nwith Mrs. Leonard, and obtained much evidential matter claiming\nto be given by the spirit of a Mr. W. A. who had been well\nknown to both of them. The account is like that of any other\n\" good \" Leonard sitting, but is a little confusing to read because\nthe communications are recorded as in the words of the communi-\ncator though apparently the Feda control actually persisted through-\nout. The most remarkable fact recorded is that there seems to\nhave been a \" direct voice utterance of one word, a phenomenon\nwhich has never been previously recorded in connection with\nMrs. Leonard's mediumship.\nMr. Bradley then \\asited various other well-known mediums\nwith rather less satisfactory results. The accounts are mainly of\ninterest as tending to shew that his previous successes had not,\nas so often happens, destroyed his faculty of criticism.\nHis second Leonard sitting was on November 27, and was\nattended as before by Mrs. Bradley. The interest of this sitting\ndepends mainly on the knowledge claimed by the controls of the\nevents of the American .sittings. As before, the chief part was\ntaken by W. A., but \" Annie also communicated freely and\ndescribed in considerable detail what she had told Mr. Bradley\nat the Valiantine sittings. It is cleaj that the evidential value\nof these communications depends on how much had become known\nin this country of Mr. Bradley s American experiences. He had\nreturned about five months earlier and had made no secret about\nthem, and though the second sitting like the first was anonymous\nit is difficult to be certain that his identity was unknown, either\nconsciously or unconsciously, to Mrs. Leonard. This difficulty\nrather impairs the value of the evidential matter obtained, which\nat this sitting consisted largely of very detailed and accurate\nreferences to what had passed at the Valiantine sittings, the\nalleged communicator being now the same sister who had been\nrecognized by Mr. Bradley at his first experience. There is so\nmuch valuable evidence ofliered in this account that it is impossible\nnot to feel some regret that there is not rather more detail\navailable. It would be interesting to know whether the \" elderly\ngentleman giving the initials M. J. B. was recognized by Mr.\nBradlev, and whether the name of \" old A.,'\" given in full at the\n229849\n\f16 Journal of. .Society , for Psychical Resea\/ixh Jan., 1925\nsecond sitting, was or was not one of the two names mentioned by\nMrs. Bradley to W. A. during the course of the first, and repre-\nsented by blanks in the report on p. 53. Space does not allow\nof any further summary of the Leonard sittings, which do not\ndiffer in essentials from the numerous other \" good \" Leonard\nsittings reported by other sitters. Early in 1924 Mr. Bradley\ninvited Valiantine to his house and held there a series of sittings.\nIn the course of these he obtained much further evidence of the\nsame kind as that of the previous Valiantine sittings. A large\nnumber of sitters attended, and many of them seem to have been\nsatisfied that they were actually conversing with a departed friend.\nThe most noteworthy phenomena are perhaps the recorded conver-\nsations in various foreign languages, including German (Feb. 19),\nWelsh (Feb. 27) and Italian (Feb. 28), none of which languages\nValiantine is believed to know. These conversations were im-\npressive and convincing to those who took part in them.\nTheir description will confirm the belief of those who are already\nconvinced on other grounds of the possibility of such communi-\ncations, but they do not appear to go further to satisfy the\nsceptical reader than do the records of other investigators, with\nthe possible exception of the recorded conversations in foreign\nlanguages. There is practically nothing communicated which was\nnot known to the sitter at the time the communication was made.\nThe third part of the book deals with a series of scripts obtained\nthrough automatic writing by Mrs. Travers Smith. They were\nwritten mostly in answer to questions propounded by Mr. Bradley\non various philosophical and ethical topics, and are necessarily\nnon-evidential, since it is not possible to judge the correctness of\nthe replies given.\nThe main interest of Mr. Bradley's work is the degree of corre-\nspondence which can be shewn to exist between the Valiantine\nand Leonard communications, and it is to be hoped that he may\nbe able in the future to investigate more fully the relations between\nthese two groups of controls. y j Woolley\nCONCERNING PAKT XCII.

Tea was served from 4 until 4.45 p.m. Sir\nWilliam Barrett spoke on telepathy. Mrs. X., introduced by\nDr. F. C. S. Schiller, gave an interesting account of her\nexperiences in a haunted house, and corroborative statements\non some points were made by Mr. X. and Dr. Schiller. Mrs.\nX.'s account was much appreciated by those who heard it,\nand the cordial thanks of the Society are due to her for her\nkindness in giving it.\nA RECENT NEWSPAPER TEST\nBy the Rev. C. Drayton Thomas\nThe S.P.R. Journal for May 1921, published an account of\nexperiments which took the form of forecasts to be verified\nin The Times newspa^jer for the day following. The medium\nwas Mrs. Osborne Leonard, and the asserted communicators\nwere my father and sister. Although these forecasts have\nbeen superseded by other forms of experiment, they continue\nto be given from time to time, avowedly for practice. I here\ndescribe the most recent example transcribed from notes of a\nsitting on October 3rd, 1924. This forecast was given at\n2.30 p.m. A duplicate copy posted that evening reached Mrs.\nSalter next morning, its envelope bearing postmark, \" Bromley,\n9.30 p.m. 3 Oct. 1924.\"\nImmediately before introducing this newspaper test Feda\n(Mrs. Leonard's control) referred to a communicator whom I\nhad no difficulty in recognising as an old friend and fellow\nstudent in psychical research, who had more than once given\nmessages of a highly evidential character through Mrs. Leonard\nand also through Mr. Vout Peters. There had, however, been\nno attempt to give his name, nor had I ever mentioned it in\nthe presence of any medium. But on this occasion there was\na double reference to the name :\n\u2014\n(a) I was told that it might be found in my house \" stamped\ninto the outside of a book\"; also\n\u2014\n(b) \" He says that, for experiment, he has looked out a test\n\fFeb., 1925 A Recent Neivspaper Test 19\nwhich your father will give for him. Times for to-morrow ;\ncolumn two, page one, see this man's two names. One given\ncorrectly, the other is part of his name, yet enough to show that\nMs name is meant by us.\"\nSince the name is required for elucidation of the above I\nhere make it public for the first time,\u2014Cyril Lockhart Hare.\nOn reaching home I discovered it stamped deeply into the\nsoft suede cover of his book published posthumously and\nprivately some ten years ago. I had of course read the book\nand therefore must once have been familiar mth its appear-\nance, although quite unaware at the time of tliis sitting\nwhether or no the above description was correct.\n[Upp\u00ab^haI\u00a3of\nJ^fJ^ TIMES\nSaturday, October 4th, 1924.\nColumn 1 2 3\n^T?r?T?T?T?lT DOREEN\nDOREEN DOREEN\nthe 1st April\nCYRIL\nBerkshire\nWETHERBEE\nWetherbee\nHILAIRE\nship \" Westward \" sailing\n1\nTRUSTWORTHY\nton reverse\nof page.\nFrom this preliminary we turn to investigate the front page\nof The Times for October 4th, 1924. In column one, less than\nhalf way down, appears the name cyril. On a level with\nthis, in column two, the name hare lies buried in hilaire,\nwhich gives the required letters in correct order. Interpreting\nthe directions strictly one would have expected to find both.\n\f20 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Feb., 1925\nnames in the second column. Whether by accident or design\ntheir exact position in the column was not stated ;\nyet an\nimportant location mark is found in words connecting the\nthree following sections of the test,\n\u2014\" very close to one of\nthese names \" ; \"a little lower in the same column \" ; \"in\nconjunction with it.\"\nThus the next three items, to be correct, must be found\nnear together and close to the foregoing names Cyril and\nHilaire. We shall find that they do so appear. I now give\nthe remainder of the tests ; in each instance quoting Feda's\nexact words, and adding a note respecting their verification.\n\" The syllable bar is very close to one of these names.\"\nBelow Cyril, and separated only by one line, is Berkshire,\nof which, the first syllable contains the sound required. In\ntaking down this forecast I spelled according to sound, as\nexperience indicated that Feda would probably fail to give\nthe letters correctly if asked for them.\n\" A little lower in the same column he saw name of a place\nwhich you visited while on holiday this year.\"\nImmediately beneath the words Cyril and Berkshire comes\nthe name wetherbee twice repeated ;\ndespite its termination\nthis suggests the Yorkshire town Wetherby, which I visited\nmore than once while on hohday at Harrogate last July.\n\" In conjunction with it was seen a name . . . can't get that\n(exclaims Feda) ... of a quality to be aimed at and worked for.\"\nThe \" name of a quality to be aimed at and worked for\n\"\nis found in bold type one inch below Wetherbee, hit on the\nreverse of the page. It is the word trustworthy. In my\nlong experience of these tests there have been sufiiciently\nnumerous instances of the required word appearing on the\nreverse of the designated spot to indicate some cause other\nthan chance. This is a not unfamihar happening in book\ntests, but there the page is already printed, and one may\nconcede that the operating inteUigence might well find diffi-\nculty in discerning upon which side of thin paper certain\nwords appear, more especially as the books are not open at\nthe time. In the case of a newspaper not in type at the\n\fFeb., 1925 A Recent Newspaper Test 21\ntime of the experiment we may suspect still greater difficulties\neven though we cannot formulate them mentally.\n\" Column three, a little above half down, Etta got feeling of\na well-known book which we, you and I, both know well.\"\nThe well-known book is perhaps Westward Ho ! for\n\" Westward,\" placed between inverted commas, stands four\ninches above half-way down colunm three. It occurs in the\nline,\u2014 shiji ^'Westward\" sailing shortly. My sister Etta and\nI had been specially interested in Kingsley's Westward Ho\n!\nwhen residing in the part of Devon where that story centres.\n\" Just above it, and close, seemed to be figures or numbers:\nwhich indicated a time when she and father are often with you,\nand when you would expect them.\"\nThis is striking ;\nfor, immediately above the word \" West-\nward \" and but one inch distant, appears a date, the 1st\nApril. This was the day on which my sister died. Each\nyear, at my sitting next following the anniversar)^, she speaks\nof having spent part of that day with me. It is therefore a\nhabit of mine to think specially of her and of my father, and\nto reahse their presence with me, on that date.\nIt is signilicant that all the above verifications are found\nwithin a space only six by two inches. Such a collection of\ntest words mthin a small area has been frequently conspicuous.\n\" Look for the word door.\" (Here I inquired for the spelling\nof this word.) \" Felt like the door of room.\"\nNo clue was given to the whereabouts of the word door,\nbut an advertisement three inches above the foregoing date\nmentions the name doreen four times in large type. In the\nfirst syllable of this name we have the sound required, though\nnot the spelUng expected. The sound dore would have an\nattraction for my sister, because dore (without the accentu-\nated E) is one of her names. I have estabhshed to my own\nsatisfaction that Feda is frequently unable to hear names, or\nisolated words, with any degree of certainty ; and that, where\npossible, she expects to be helped by being shown, or impressed\nby the idea of, some object having a name similar or identical\nin sound. In this instance the picture, or impression, of a\n\f22 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Feb., 1925\ndoor would be the only such, assistance which a communicator\ncould give. Be this as it may, a frequent feature of these\ntests has been that spelling is ignored and identity of sound\nreUed upon.\nAn accompanying sketch exhibits the above words in rela-\ntive position, together with indication of their place in regard\nto the whole page.\nTwo items were given for page five, but the verification of\nthese is not sufficiently definite to detain us.\nThe total result of the experiment shows, as usual, a ming-\nling of accurate and inaccurate ; but it will be conceded that\nhits are more numerous than misses. Neither The Times for\nthe day before October 4th, nor for the day after, afford any\nhits whatever. It might be interesting to ascertain what\ndegree of correspondence could be found between this forecast,\ngiven for October 4th, and any half score of Times for dates\nselected at random. This has been done on a previous occa-\nsion and the result showed that chance coincidence averaged\nless than two successes, as against ten obtained in the experi-\nment through Mrs. Leonard. (See Some New Evidence for\nHuman Survival, pp. 145-7.)\nIt may be asked how much of the information revealed\ncould have been known to Mrs. Leonard normally ? Exactly\nthe following and no more : \u2014That I had spent my holiday in\nHarrogate ; that my sister's death occurred on April 1st\n;\nthat Dore was one of my sister's names ; and that I was\nfamiliar wath the west of England.\nIt will be perceived at once that, supposing we grant the\nmedium's possession of these facts, the problem of the news-\npaper test remains unchanged. For the problem is this :\n\u2014\nHow came it to pass that these items of information were\nsuccessfully j^aired with words which were not yet in type,\nbut which would by midnight be placed in the designated\npositions in the paper and page stated ? The forecast was\ngiven at 2.30 p.m., an hour when no operator of The Times\noffice would know in what part of the columns the advertise-\nments would finally be placed.\nVerifications such as the foregoing are interesting, although\nnot sensational. Can the result be attributed to normal\n\fFeb., 1925 A Recent Newspaper Test 23\ncauses ? If not, then the action of a supernormal faculty\nproduced this forecast. What was the nature of this faculty\nand by whom was it exercised ? My communicators have\nsaid that this type of test was devised to show that they\ncould produce forecasts which ehminated the hypothesis of\ntelepathy between sitter and medium, since they combine\nmatter familiar to the sitter with information which could\nbe known only, if at all, to The Times officials. It is further\nclaimed that the method employed in forecasting the approxi-\nmate whereabouts of names upon a page not yet in type is\nan extension of clairvoyant faculty, a viewing of \" the shadow\ncast before.\" If the above verifications justify that claim we\nare confronted by a phenomenon which may throw some hght\nupon those more distant forecasts of which Dr. Eugene Osty\nhas given examples in his recent book, and of which Prof.\nCamiUe Flammarion has recorded many strilring instances. As\nProf. Charles Eichet has recently written :\n\u2014\n\" Among all these perplexing phenomena there is one that is\nmore perplexing than any others\u2014Prevision. It is established by\nproofs that are absolutely certain, but it remains totally incom-\nprehensible.\"\nMEMORY.\nBy F. C. Constable.\nIt is most important for Psychical Research that when we use\nthe term \" memory \" we should have as clear an idea as\npossible as to what we mean by the term.\nNow in all the discussion that has arisen, I think there has\nbeen an underlying error. Memory has been confounded with\nthe use of memory.\nWhen we remember anything, what we do is that we think,\nin the present passing moment, about something that happened\nin the past of our lives. When, in the present, we remember\nsomething that happened in the past, what is it that we do ?\nWe use, in the present, something already in our minds, what-\never our \" minds \" may be. In some way or other this past\nmust be in our minds or we could not \" take it out \" to use\nit in the present.\n\f24 Journal of Society for PsycJiical Research Feb., 3925\nThis power in man I define as memory. The use of the\npower, that is the use in the present, of the past stored up in\nthe mind\u2014is the use of memory.\nI have, in Personality and Telepathy, worked out at inordin-\nate length a theory of memory. Good, bad or indifferent, I\nthink it starts on the right line, that is, on the distinction\nbetween memory and the use of memory.\nI try now shortly and so, necessarily, dogmatically to state\nwhat the theory is. And, as I know well the dishke in the\nwest for the abstract, I try to keep as close as is possible to the\nconcrete.\nConsider any man of fifty years of age. From the cradle he\nhas had personal experience of a series of events. The events\nhave come and gone in time. But how did the mind of the\nman function ivith the events ? It did not function with per-\nceptions or even conceptions. It functioned with ideas of the\nevents. We do not think a chair, table, or indeed any object.\nWe think about it. That is, our minds function with ideas of\nthings, ideas which give us certain information about \" things.\"\nWhen an event has come to an end we can still think \" about\nit \" because an idea of the event remains stored up in the mind.\nThe events of the man's life have come and gone in time.\nBut the ideas of the events remain in the man's mind. The\nevents perish : the ideas still live.^ There is in the man's mind\na storage of ideas of his past human experience. This storage\nI define as memory.\nIn ordinary parlance we say the man has a good, bad or\nindifi'erent memory. What do we mean by saying this 1 We\ncannot mean that this storage of memory is good, bad or in-\ndifferent. What we mean is that his use of the storage is good,\nbad or indifferent.\nBut what do we mean by the use of memory ?\nLet the man of fifty be taken to have an indifferently good\nmemory. He can, then, remember many events that took\n1 Bert-rand Russell, referring to the dematerialization of matter by science,\nstates :\n\" The whole solidity (of matter) is gone, and with it the character-\nistics that, to the materiaUsts, made matter seem more real than fleeting\nthoughts.\" (Cf. Psyche, vol. v. p. 115). Ideas of events outlive events. We\nget an inlding of Platonism.\n\fFeb., 1925 Memonj 25\nplace at difiering periods of Ms lifetime. He can do this\nbecause, though the events themselves have perished in time,\nideas of the events remain stored in his mind. He remembers,\nlet us say, an event of ten years ago. What does this mean ?\nIt means that he takes out of his storage of ideas one par-\nticular idea and uses it in relation to himself and his himian\nexperience, as he exists ten years after the event happened\n\u2014\nten years after the event has come to an end. The same is\ntrue for all the events that he can remember.\nNow here comes in the contradiction between the expr-essed\nopinions of Ricliet and Sir Oliver Lodge. The question I now\nconsider about which there is dispute is this :\n\u2014What is the\nmind of man which has this storage of ideas 1 I hold that no\none can deny that the storage exists.\nRichet holds that the storage is in the brain of man. Let\nus consider this argument.\nThe brain of man is manifest in our sensible universe, it is\na \" subject of consciousness.\" In Kant's words, it is subject\nto time and space, which are the absolutely first formal prin-\nciples of our sensible world. ^ The brain of man is subject to the\nchanges of time and space. It follows that the contents of the\nbrain must be subject to the changes of time and space. This\nappears to me to be a logical conclusion.\nBut what is the human experience of the man of fifty years\nof age ? All the events of his life have perished in time and\nspace, the very form of his brain has changed with the changes\nof his time and space. And yet the man finds in his mind a\npractically changeless storage of ideas. When he takes out of\nhis storage an idea, the idea is the same as if he had taken\nit out when he was, let us say, forty years old. It is true\nthat relatively to the man when forty it would not have had\nthe same relative appearance as when he was fiity. But this\ncomes from no change in the idea itself. It comes because the\nman himself, as a living organism of body, brain and thought\n(so far as thought is correlated to the motion of the brain)\nhas changed in time and space. Our universe is one of rela-\n^ a. Kant's Inaugural Dissertation of 1770 (by W. J. Eckoff, Columbia\nUniversity, New York, 1894, pp. 63, 67). Kant never resUed from this.\nAlexander's \" space-time \" originated with Kant.\n\f26 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Feb., 1925\ntivity, not of the absolute. So wlien the man's outlook changes\nthe \"same thing\" takes on a different aspect.^\nI think that this permanent content of ideas cannot exist in\na material \" thing \" like the brain, which is subject, in con-\ntinuity, to the changes of time and space. An event of my\nown life which happened in 1867, is as clear and definite in\nme at the present time as when, over fifty years ago, the idea\nfirst became mine. How could any \" j^ermanent thing \" be\nstereotyped on a changing material object ?\nThis practically permanent storage of ideas does, I think,\nexist. And, if so, what it is stored in must be permanent, that\nis, not subject to the changes of time and space. It cannot,\nthen, be stored up in the brain, which is subject to the changes\nof time and space. I think the \" mind \" that ideas are stored\nup in cannot be that changing thing the brain.\nIf the distinction between memory and the use of memory\nbe accepted, I think that, logically, we must refer back memory\n(the storage of ideas) to a permanent mind in man, and not\nto that material thing the brain, which is subject to the\nchanges of time and space. For there is nothing permanent\nabout the brain from childhood to old age. It does not, as\ntime passes, merely accrete the potentiality of motion, accrete\nit on something which in its origin is permanent. Its whole\nform changes with the changes of time and space. Besides\nthis, no idea exists in itself. All ideas must be mine or yours\nas conditions of their existence. And this means that ideas can\nonly exist for or in relation to personalities.\nThe argiiment cannot here be carried further, or we shall be\nlanded in the metaphysical. All now attempted is to show,\nlogically, that memory cannot be regarded as dependent on the\nexistence of the brain.\n^ We all regard the same one universe from different points of view. For\neach of ns, as personalities, there appears to be a different universe. What-\never the universe may be, or may not be, it is subjective to each one of us\nas human beings.\n\fFeb., 1925 Correspondence 27\nCOEEESPONDENCE.\nConcerning Telepathic Communication with Animals.\nTo the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.\nMadam,\u2014I have for a long time held the opinion that Ught\nmight be thrown on the subject of Telepathy by a careful study\nof what appears to be telepathic communication between different\nanimals ; also by any well authenticated instances of telepathy\nbetween human beings and domesticated animals.\nIn A Game.

M. KiNGSFORD.\nEXTRACT FROM A GAME RANGER'S NOTE-BOOK,\nBy a. Blayney Percival, page 274.\nThe thing that struck me more than anything else while watching\nthe giraffe at Sultan Hamud was this : the whole troop would\nbe scattered over an area of perhaps a couple of acres, feeding\nor standing ;\nsuddenly, with one accord, all would drift away\nin the same direction as though in obedience to some signal seen\nsimultaneously by every eye. Sight, however, was not the sense\nto which the command was addressed\u2014if there were a command\n\u2014\nfor many of the animals would be standing in positions whence\nthey could not see their fellows. Not a sound was heard, but\nthe unanimity of the movement gave the impression that they\npossess some mysterious means of intercommunication. It was\nalmost uncanny, the singleness of mind with which the great\n-creatures aU moved in the same direction.\nThe giraffe was for long supposed to be incapable of uttering\nany sound at all ;\nthey are extremely silent creatures, and it was not\nuntil I had had a good many years' experience with game in Africa\nthat I first heard one raise its voice.\n\f28 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Feb., 1925\nII. A Forgotten Memory Eevived in a Dream.\nith September, 1924.\nDear Madam,\u2014The following may interest you.\nI possess two heavy hammers, one kept for driving goat-stakes,\none for household use. A few weeks ago I broke the goat-\nhammer, and went to fetch the other, but could not find it. I\nhunted everywhere likely for it, and had it constantly in mind,\nbecause until the other could be repaired I had to make do with\na light hammer. At last I had what I believed an \" inspira-\ntional \" flash of an idea ; I seemed to recollect that I had last\nused it when a neighbour was helping with a job. He moved\naway some months ago, and I decided (on this inspiration) that\nhe had helped himself to my hammer. I can't say I had for-\ngotten the matter, because I have never replaced the tool, and\nmiss it every time I do a job with a hammer too light.\nLast night I dreamt I was walking in the long rough grass\nnear the bee-hives, and saw my hammer, fine and bright, on the\ntop of the grass.\nTo-day, some hours after I had risen\u2014about 11 a.m.\u2014I sud-\ndenly recalled this dream in a \" flash vision \" induced by stooping\nand getting blood to the head. I went to the rough grass, which\nis very bad, as I have been unwell and neglecting my hives, and\nis never grazed, as I can't let animals down there. With a hoe\nand sickle I got some of the rough cut away and beaten down,\nand there between two large stones was my hammer ; but not\nbright, very rusty, and the haft sodden.\nThe rough grass is a patch some 2|\u20143| yards in width, and I\nshould say 14\u201418 yards long. The grass and weeds are knee-\nhigh, and matted by being grown through.\nI have since recalled that in the early part of the year, before\nthe bees were working, I put a brood of ducklings in coop out in\nthat spot to forage for a week or two, and probably had the\nhammer to mend the coop some time.\nBefore sleeping last night I had no thought of the hammer, but\nwas dee2)ly concerned about a little old pet which is very ill, and\nI rose in the night to see her\u2014whether before or after my dream\nI don't at all know.\nIda Wild.\n\fFeb., 1925 Review 29\nREVIEW.\n\u2022\u2022(1) Die Stellung der heutigen Wissenschaft zu den pampsychischen\nPhdnomenen. By Prof. Karl Camillo Schneider. Pp. 53.\n(2) Gesundung durch Erziehtmg, Paedagogische Psycliogymnastik,\nPersuasion und Coueismus. By Prof. Dr. Ferdinand Winkler.\nPp. 25.\n(3) Psycliologie der Suggestion. By Dr. A. Missriegler. Pp. 25.\nFornung Nos. 2-4 of the Vienna Parapsychic Library, and\nall published by Johannes Baum, PfulHngen, Wiirttemberg.\n(1) Of these three publications of the Vienna Parapsychic Institute,\nthat of Prof. Schneider of Vienna University, the President of the\nInstitute, is the longest and most important. It is an ambitious\nattempt to determine how and on what assumptions the various'\n'\noccult '\nphenomena, telepathy, telekinesis, dream, madness,\nclairvoyance and magic, assuming them to exist, could be ac-\ncommodated within the scheme of modern science. But the\nattempt is too ambitious for the space allowed, and the result\nis very tough reading. For Prof. Schneider plunges so deep into\nmetaphysics that he can extricate himself by nothing short of a\ntheory of creation, which makes not God (who is '\nimprisoned\n'\nin it) but nothingness the creator of the world, and derives its\norigin from \" a stupid accident \"\n(p. 49). The truth is that he\nhas tried to pack too much into a small space, and has not\nroom enough to develop his ideas : they are only indicated very\nconcisely, and much of the argument is left obscure. In particular,\nit is not adequately explained how precisely the '\noccult ' pheno-\nmena support Prof. Schneider's interpretation of their significance.\nPhilosophically, Prof. Schneider is perhaps over-anxious to fit the\noccult into a scheme of realist metaphysics, whereas on the face\nof it it seems rather to contest the unique reahty of the physical\nworld our science has constructed, and to point to vistas radiating\nout from the same material of immediate experience in a great\nvariety of directions. The indications seem to be distinctly\npluralistic, and they certainly look easier to interpret idealistically.\nBut it is perhaps a Uttle premature to dispute about the philo-\nsophic interpretations of phenonema that are still so imperfectly\nknown and controlled.\n(2) Dr. Winkler's pamphlet is a medical appreciation of Coue's\n\f30 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Feb., 1925-\nmethods, which ajiproves of his practices while rejecting his-\ntheories. Dr. Winkler emphasizes the need of cooperation between\nthe will to heal of the doctor and the will to get well of the\npatient, and relates (p. 11) how the victims of morbid itching\nwhom he had treated with amyl nitrite and temporarily relieved\nwere able to repress an attack by merely imagining this treatment.\n(3) Dr. Missriegler is an enthusiastic Freudian and an opponent\nof medical materiahsm. He regards suggestion as always involving\nan appeal to a dissociated part of the self, of which normal\nconsciousness in not aware, and holds that aifto-hypnosis is always-\nin ultimate analysis dependent on \/ieiero-hypnosis.\nF.

The following Members w'ere present : Mr. W. W.\nBaggally, Miss Jephson, Sir Lawence Jones, Bart., Mrs.\nKingsley, Mr. W. H. Salter, Miss Scatcherd, Mr. W. S. Mont-\ngomery Smith and Dr. V. J. Woolley ;\n(and, by proxy, Mr.\nHenry Bury, Mr. F. C. Constable, Miss Dutton, Rev. W. S.\nIr^^ng, Mss S. M. Kingsford, Dr. T. W. Mitchell, Mrs. W. H.\nSalter, Mr. H. F. Saltmarsh, Dr. F. C. S. Schiller, Mrs. Henry\nSidgwick and Mr. W. Whately Smith).\nThe Chairman presented the Report of the Council. Mr.\nW. H. Salter read the Report to the Meeting ; and discussion\nwas invited.\nThe Hon. Treasurer (Mr. W. H. Salter) in presenting\nthe Financial Statement said that there was not much more\nto say about the finances than had been said in the Report\nwhich he had just read. The Society had, both in 1923 and\n1924, been fortunate in receiving donations from several\nmembers, by virtue of which it had acquired a very satisfactory\nSeance Room and had a sum in hand towards equipping it\nwith special apparatus, as well as a certain sum for a specific\n\f36 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Mae., 1925\ninvestigation. He thought that members did not always under-\nstand that any single investigation of a medium entailed a\ngreat deal of expense, e.g. the recent investigation of Herr\nWilli Schneider had cost more than \u00a3200 ; and in addition\nthere would be the expense of publishing a Report. Mediums\nmust be engaged well ahead. He beheved in a forward poUcy\nas regards investigating any mediums wilUng to accept the\nproperly vigorous conditions imposed by the tS.P.R. In order\nto make these arrangements well in advance, the Society\nmust have money in hand to carry them out. With this\nobject a sum, comparatively small as it was for the work\nin view, had during the past year been placed in a temporary\ninvestment realisable without delay at any time. But he\nurged that it was imperative to increase the settled income\nof the Society, and particularly that of the Endowment Fund,\nand he hoped that Members would use their influence in\nthis respect.\nThe Chairman announced that the six retiring Members\nof Council offered themselves for re-election. No other nomina-\ntions having been received, the following were declared to\nbe duly elected Members of the Council : Mr. W. W. Baggally,\nDr. T. W. Mitchell, Mr. W. H. Salter, Mrs. W. H. Salter,\nMr. Sydney C. Scott, and Mrs. Henry Sidgwick.\nPRIVATE MEETING.\nThe 81st Private Meeting for Members and Associates was\nheld in the House of the Society, 31 Tavistock Square, London,\nW.C., on Thursday, February 5th, 1925, at 5.15 p.m.; The\nPresident in the chair.\nA Paper entitled \" A Report on some Further Evidence\nobtained through Mrs. Leonard \" was read by Mrs. W. H.\nSalter. It is hoped that the full Report will be published\nlater in the Proceedings.\nANNUAL REPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR 1924.\nA DIFFICULTY from which the Council suffers every year in\nmaldng its Annual Report to the Society is that of avoiding\na sort of sameness\u2014a sameness which is really inevitable,\n\fMar., 1925 Atmual Report of the Council 37\nbecause the work we have to do from year to year is so\nmuch the same. For the Society exists to collect and investi-\ngate, or rather encourage investigation of, certain phenomena,\nand to bring the evidence concerning the supernormal origin\nof these up to a sufficiently high standard to be worth con-\nsidering. In some cases we succeed in obtaining adequate\nevidence and then the results are printed in the Journal or\nProceedings ; but often we fail for various reasons. Occasion-\nally definite evidence that the phenomenon in question is not\nsupernormal can be discovered, but this is relatively rare.\nOf course, it is only selected cases to which our attention is\ncaUed ; and those in which a normal explanation is fairly\nob\\'ious do not as a rule come before us unless the explanation\nhas some features of special interest. In most of the cases,\nv\/hether experimental or spontaneous, which we try to investi-\ngate, the result tends to be inconclusive, and nothing is\nobtained worth reporting. Much time and labour may be spent\nby the ofiicers of the Society or by private members on\ninvestigations of this sort, of which the Society never hears,\nand which superficially may appear to be spent in vain.\nBut such work is sometimes very important. It is of course\nour business as a Society to classify the facts that come\nbefore us, and to endeavour as far as possible not only to\naccumulate evidence, but to throw light on the conditions\nand causes of the phenomena. 'For this purpose phenomena\nwhich cannot be regarded as in themselves clear cases of,\nsay, telepathy, or communication from the dead, or of super-\nnormal movement of material objects, may yet fall into line\nwith more decidedly evidential cases and sometimes throw\nlight on these. Another reason why long perseverance in not\nvery successful experiments may prove useful, is that possibly\ntelepathic and other powers may be cultivated and developed.\nThe assistance received this year from members of the\nSociety in work and in interest has again been very satis-\nfactory and much valued.\nIn the way of new evidence received from members the\nmost outstanding are the experiments in thought-transference\ncarried out by Professor Murray, continuing those reported on\nin 1916 by Mrs. Verrall. This further set he sent to the Society\n\f38 Journal of ISodety for Psychical Research Mab., 1925\nfor analysis and report by Mrs. Sidgwick\u2014and this report was\nread at a meeting on December 12th and is just about to\nappear in Part 92 of Proceedings. The interest excited by\nnewspaper references to that Meeting has led to private letters\nbeing received from several persons, not members of the\nSociety, who believe themselves, on apparently good grounds,\nto have telepathic faculty of one kind or another, and it is\nhoped that this may lead to further good evidence. These\nletters, and others sent to the newspapers, show, it is true,\nsome interest in the subjects of our research, but also wide-\nspread ignorance of the objects and even of the existence of\nour Society, and it is perhaps worth suggesting to members\nthe possibility of advertising it by enclosing when writing to\nsuitable correspondents a copy of the leaflet known as \" Objects\nof the Society,\" of which any number of copies can be obtained\nfrom the Secretary.\nAnother long record of experiments and of some other\nplienomena during the last ten years has been sent by a\nmember of the Society who made a systematic effort during\nthat time to get into touch with a deceased relative, and to\nobtain from him, by answers to questions and otherwise,\ninformation unknown to the sitters. Most of the attempts\nwere made with an alphabet and a tumbler serving as pointer,\non the Ouija-board plan, the automatist who seemed to affect\nthe movements most being usually blindfolded and often not\nknomng the question. Great pains were taken in selecting\nthe questions, and in investigating the correctness of the\nanswers and other information given. The result gives indica-\ntion of some success in establishing the identity of the com-\nmunicator, and there is comparatively little error ; but owing\nperhaps to poor automatism, or restriction imposed on the\ncommunicators by questions put by the experimenter, there\nis too little in the communications definitely and unmistakably\nright, to be worth publishing. There are, however, interesting\npoints, and we are glad that the experimenter has allowed\nher long manuscript record to remain at the rooms, so that\nit is available for the use of serious students.\nAt the other end of our scale, some time was spent in\nlooking into a case of supposed communication from the dead,\n\fMae., 1925 Annual Meport of the Council 39\nwhich turned out to be a rather elaborate hoax perpetrated\nby a member of a circle of friends. It was described in the\nJournal for October last under the title \"A Fictitious Com-\nmunicator.\"\nAs regards experiments\u2014the members of the group, includ-\ning Jliss Newton, who, as mentioned in our last report, were\nexperimenting regularly in telepathy and clairvoyance, are\nstill at work, and generally meet once a week. They are,\nhowever, not yet prepared to report their results. They would\ngladly welcome members or friends who have reason to think\nthat they possess some telepathic faculty.\nMr. Dingwall has continued in our Seance-room the experi-\nments which were begun in 1923 with the young German\nladv\u2014not a professional medium\u2014whom we mav call !iVIiss\nV J. .y\nHermann. The experiments have been carried on at intervals\nthroughout the year, and the phenomena\u2014chiefly raps and\nmovements of objects without contact\u2014are interesting, but\nMr. Dingwall would prefer to obtain further results before\nreporting. We are much indebted to Miss Hermann and the\nlady she lives with, for the kind way in which they have\nco-operated with Mr. Dingwall.\nAnother series of sittings has been carried out by Mr.\nDingwall in the Seance-room with a young man mth whom\nsome unusual photographic phenomena are said to occur.\nThis gentleman, who is a near relative of one of our members,\nhas very kindly lent himself to experiment, and demands the\nstrictest test conditions. Results of some interest have been\nintermittently obtained, but not as yet in sufficient quantity to\nwarrant a conclusion as to their nature.\nA short series of sittings was also held in the Seanee-room\n\\vith a professional medium in whose presence it was reported\nthat luminous appearances had been observed. The sittings\nwere, however, uniformly negative in result, and were therefore\ndiscontinued.\nTowards the end of the year, by invitation from the Council,\nthe Austrian medium, Willi Schneider, visited England\naccompanied by Mrs. Holub, widow of the late Dr. Holub.\nThe sittings, which were under the direction of Dr. WooUey,\nwere held in the Seance-room, and some excellent results were\n\f40 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Mah., 1925'\nobtained under good conditions : both levitation of objects\nuntouched by the medium, and movements of objects within\na gauze cage such as that used with this medium by Dr.\nvon Schrenck-Notzing at Munich (see Journal for October\n1922). It is intended to publish an account of these experi-\nments shortly.\nThe Seance-room, described and photographed in the Decem-\nber Journal, has been found most convenient for all these\nseries of sittings ; and the various fittings and arrangements,\nmostly planned and carried out by Mr. Dingwall, work smoothly\nand well.\nThe Research Officer made two visits abroad during the\nyear\u2014one to Copenhagen in January, to investigate the\nphenomena said to occur with Einer Nielsen and with another\nDanish medium. The results were not satisfactory, as the\nconditions demanded by the mediums prevented any decision\nbeing reached as to the origin of the phenomena.\nHis second visit was to Paris in February on the invitation\nof the late Dr. Geley to be present at sittings with the Italian\nmedium, Pasquale Erto. An account of his impressions, and\nof the subsequent discrediting of the bona fides of the medium\nby a committee in Paris, was given in the Journal for June\n1924.\nMr. Dingwall is now abroad again, partly on behalf of the\nSociety, and partly for private purposes, and hopes to make\na series of enquiries both in Europe and America bearing on a\nnumber of public and private mediums.\nAn attempt by Dr. WooUey and Mr. Dingwall to investigate\na poltergeist case of special interest in Leicester, in which\nthey were greatly helped by one of our members in that town.\nMiss G. Vincent, should also be mentioned. On a first visit,\nwhich was made by Mr. Dingwall alone, some curious pheno-\nmena were observed, for which he was unable to perceive any\nnormal explanation ; but on his second visit, when he Avas\naccompanied by Dr. WooUey, the phenomena had completely\nceased, and they have not since recurred. The accounts given\nto our investigators indicated that while the phenomena were\nmainly spontaneous, they could also be induced by setting up\nap])ropriate conditions.\n\fMae., 1925 Annual Report of the Council 41\nWe may take this opportunity of thanking members who\nhave reported to us cases occurring in their neighbourhood,\nor have sent newspaper accounts of cases elsewhere. We\nshould be very glad if more members would make a practice\nof helping us in this way.\nDuring the year Mr. Baggally made attempts to induce\nthe Zancigs to submit to an investigation, but they regretted\nhaving to refuse on the ground of want of time.\nAn investigation of \" Eyeless sight \" was also contemplated,\nand one of our members, Lady Malmesbury, offered to con-\ntribute towards the expense, but omng to the fact that M.\nRomain's trained subjects were apparently no longer available,\nand to his absence from Paris, it was not found possible to\narrange for any experiments.\nThere has been some re-arrangement of administrative work.\nDr. Woolley has during the year undertaken the post of\nHonorary Research Officer instead of that of Honorary Secre-\ntary, and it has involved him in a very considerable amount\nof work, especially during the sittings with Willi Schneider.\nMr. Salter has added the work of joint Honorary Secretary\nto that of Honorary Treasurer.\nBy the resignation of Miss Radclyfie Hall in April, and the\ndeath of Sir George Beilby in , August, the Council has lost\ntwo of its co-opted members. Miss Radclyffe Hall resigned on\naccount of pressure of other work, and is anxious that it\nshould not be supposed that she has in any way lost interest\nin our researches. And in fact, we hope in due time to\nreceive from her and Lady Troubridge more evidence of as\ngood quality as that already published.\nThree Corresponding Members were elected during the year :\nProfessor Oesterreich of Tubingen, Mr. Carl Vett of Copen-\nhagen, and Dr. Geley. We regret that only six months after\nthe election of the last, he was killed in an aeroplane crash.\nWe have lost by death two other Corresponding Members :\nProfessor Stanley Hall of Worcester, Mass., and Mr. Severin\nLauritzen of Copenhagen ; and also an Honorary Associate of\nlong standing. Professor M. T. Falcomer of Venice.\nWe have lost by death during the year nine Members and\neight Associates, among whom we have to regret several\n\f42 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Mar., 1925\nfriends and supporters of long standing, including the Very\nHev. Hastings Rashdall, Mr. James T. Hackett, Captain Kelso,\nMiss F. M. Charlton, Mrs. Charles Baker, and Mr. F. H.\nEradley, O.M. The names of nineteen Members and nine\nAssociates have been struck off the lists owing to the non-\npayment of subscriptions. During the past year thirty-six\nMembers and nineteen Associates resigned, some of whom\nstate that they are resigning for financial reasons only, and\nseveral hope that they may rejoin later.\nSixty-two new Members and three Corresponding Members\nhave been elected, and six Associates have become Members.\nThe total membership of the Society now stands at 1,123, of\nAvhom 568 are Members and 555 Associates.\nThree Parts of Proceedings M'ere published during the year :\nPart 90 in May, Part 91 in July, and Part 93 in June.\nThe amount received by the sale of the Society's publica-\ntions to Members and Associates is \u00a336 Is. lOd. ; no complete\nsets of the Proceedings or the Journal were sold. The amount\nrealised by sales to the public by Mr. Francis Edwards is\n\u00a363 9s. 8d. ; and by the Society's American Agents, \u00a317 18s. lOd.\nAs in 1923, the Council have pleasure in recording several\nvery generous donations. Three donors, who wish to remain\nanonymous, have between them contributed \u00a3978 10s. lOd.\ntowards the building and equipment of the Seance-room, and\ntowards the Research work. Out of this, \u00a3505 17s. has been\ninvested temporarily for Research. A donation of \u00a3160 was\nalso made to the Endowment Fund.\nMoreover a donation of \u00a3200 for printing expenses was\nreceived, and Lord Dunraven generously contributed another\n\u00a3200 towards the publication of his \" Experiences in Spiritual-\nism with D. D. Home,\" issued as Part 93 of the Proceedings,\nas well as in book form.\nIt will be observed from the Balance Sheet that if the\nSociety's funds had not been so largely increased by these\ndonations, the Society would not have been in a position\nto finance out of its current income an investigation on\nthe scale of that of the mediiini Willi Schneider, without\ncutting down expenses in other directions, e.g. the issue of\npublications.\n\fMar., 1925 Annual Report of the Council 43\nNow that the Society has, for the first time in its history,\na well-equipped Seance-room, and also has definite prospects\nof investigating several mediums, the Council take this oppor-\ntunity of pressing upon Members and Associates not only\nthe necessity of increasing the membership of the Society,\nin order that the Society's work may not be hampered by\nlack of money, but also, for the same reason, the urgent\nclaims of the Endowment Fund. An Endowment Fund, properly\ninvested and thus assuring a permanent income, enables the\nCouncil to plan and carry out schemes which would be almost\nimpossible without it. Our Research Ofiicer, for instance, is\npaid from the income of the Endowment Fund, and much\ncould be done with an assured income larger than our present\nEndowment Fund furnishes.\nThe Council wish to assure Members and Associates tha,t the\nadministrative work of the Society is conducted with the\nutmost regard for economy. When the move to the Society's\npresent premises was contemplated, it was estimated that,\nthough the move would entail immediate expense, the ultimate\nresult would be a substantial saving. The Council are pleased\nto record that these anticipations have been justified. For\nthe year ending Michaelmas 1924, the net cost of the Society's\ntenancy of 31 Tavistock Square (rent, rates, repairs, house-\nkeeper's wages, etc.) was \u00a3222, as compared ^vith \u00a3289 for the\nlast year at Hanover Square. Moreover, if the Society had\nremained in its old quarters this last figure would have been\nincreased to \u00a3374.\nThe Council have approved, under certain conditions named\nin the Journal for November last, p. 327, of giving small\ngroups of Members and Associates the opportunity of meeting\nat the Society's Rooms for the purpose of relating their personal\nexperience of, and discussing, various aspects of psychical\nresearch.\nThe Council desires to speak in the highest terms of the\nzeal and energy of its salaried officials.\nFour General Meetings, two Private Meetings and a Con-\nversazione were held during the year.\n\fI\n44 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Mar., 1925-\nFebruary 14tli.

A Case of Apparent Telepathy.\nWe print below a letter from one of our members, Mr. H. F.\nSaltmarsh, in which he records what appears to have been an\ninstance of spontaneous telepathy, occurring during a series\nof experiments designed to test clairvoyance.\nMr. Saltmarsh writes as follows :\n\u2014\n2bth January, 1925.\nDear Madam,\u2014I beg to report what appears to me to be a\nclear case of telepathy.\nMy wife and 1 were undertaking some experiments in card\nguessing. A card was drawn from a full pack and held in the\nhand without being looked at and then guessed. The results\nwere recorded, and the score, according to Mr. Fisher's table\n{Proc. Vol. XXXIV. p. 181), worked out.\nOn 24th December, 1924, my wife was seated on one side of the\ndining-room table and was drawing cards from a pack for guessing.\nI was seated on the other side scoring, the distance between us\nbeing roughly five feet. As she drew the second card of the\nseries I happened to see it and wondered at the moment whether\nit would affect the result. She immediately guessed the card and\nsaid that she knew her guess was correct ; the name of the card\n* General Meetings.\n\fMab., 1925 Case 45\nflashed across her mind instantly, and the feeling was totally\ndifferent from ordinary guessing.\nThe score for a correct guess according to Mr. Fisher's table\nis 34-55 for chance, 444 for this series.\nIn the five sets of experiments done by my wife she had no\nother complete success, and her average score was about equal\nto that due to pure chance. I made a note of the occurrence at\nthe time on the back of the scoring card and enclose it for your\ninspection.\nThe mere fact of the correct guess taken alone would not be\nenough to suggest telepathy, for such coincidences must occasionally\noccur, but that the knowledge of the card should flash across\nthe mind in the one case where the card was seen by another\nperson and never in any other instance, renders the hypothesis\nof telepathy extremely probable.\nYours faithfully,\nH. F. Saltmarsh.\nTogether with this letter Mr. Saltmarsh enclosed the card\nupon which was recorded the result of the experiment on\nDecember 24th, 1924, thus :\n\u2014\nDate 24 Dec. 1924.\nGuess Card Actual Card\n1. 7 Hearts. 3 Diamonds.\n2. Knave Clubs. Knave Clubs.\n3. 10 Diamonds. Ace Hearts.\n4. 6 Spades. 8 Diamonds.\n5. 2 Hearts. 4 Spades.\nThe card is initialled by Mrs. Saltmarsh, and with reference\nto the second experiment in the series Mr. Saltmarsh has\nwritten on the back of the card :\n\u2014\nIn this case it happened that I saw the card as my wife took\nit from the pack. She said that the knowledge of the card\nflashed across her mind immediately, almost like a definite thing,\nand quite different from the other guesses. This appears an\nexcellent case of telepathy.\n\fI-t (MM\n00 00 (M\no c. c;\no 0-1 c\n00\n'-rt\nOOOOt--OOrHO\u00abOOC'l Oc^** OOr-i O OO I-\n'--^ O C3 O i-l O 00\n00 O i-H CI\nr-* rH in\no in a 1\nOO\n1-t c-.oo\nT-H\no o o\nOO\no CO rH\n1 \u00ab\n> C '\nIs I\n\u00b0 2\nP4\nto\nm.3\n3\n3 ' >\u2022\nO o\ng\n5 ^3 1=\no \u00ab\no ^\n2-w \u2022\u2022\n'o'c\nS '^P^\n^\n\u201e to >.\n-is c\nf\/\n'\no ^\nLi CO\nc\n\/\ny:\n' ' r\/.

April, ]925\nall. Thus Professor Titchener, the leading experimental psycho-\nlogist of our time, says :\n\" No scientifically-minded psychologist\nbelieves in telepathy.\" This seems to be rather an extreme\nstatement when we bear in mind that Professor Bergson, Professor\nMcDougall, and the late William James are all declared believers\nin telepathy. Titchener's statement, however, does indicate a\npoint of view which is common amongst experimental psycho-\nlogists, and Dr. Wohlgemuth's letter on the subject in Tuesday's\nTimes echoes the same scepticism. This hesitation deserves more\nattention than it commonly receives from the upholders of telepathy,\nfor it springs from a well-founded dissatisfaction with the methods\nby which experiments in telepathy are often carried out, and\nwith the quality of evidence which is commonly regarded as\nsufficient for the support of the startling assertion that there are\nother modes of communication of knowledge than the sense-organs\nwhich our examination of the human body reveals to us.\nIt must be admitted that the contribution of laboratory psycho-\nlogists to psychical research is not always very helpful. Too often\nit consists in prescribing arbitrary conditions under which the\nphenomena must take place if they are to be believed. What\nwould we think of a physicist who said that he would not believe\nin photography unless the whole process of exposing and develop-\ning a plate could take place under his observation in full daylight\nor in ball-lightning imless it could be produced in his own back\ngarden at a prescribed date ? Yet psychologists often adopt an\nattitude not far removed from this in their criticisms of psychical\nresearch, and even as open-minded an observer as the late Pro-\nfessor Stanley Hall said :\n\" Only when conditions can be so\ncontrolled that, e.g., a teacher can announce beforehand that, on\nsuch a day, hour, and place he will demonstrate these things\n[telepathy and clairvoyance] can or will they be accepted by any\nsound scientific mind.\"\nThe central point of interest in these and all similar experi-\nments is the question of whether the mode of communication\nbetween the reader and the receiver of his messages is of an\nunknown nature. It is clear that these particular experiments\nwere successful a greater number of times than could be accounted\nfor by chance alone. Two hypotheses are possible in order to\naccount for their success, and these two hypotheses must be kept\nsharply distinct. First, the ideas received by Professor Murray\n\fApril, 1925 Professor Murray's Experiments in Telepathy 53\nmay have come to him through a channel entirely different from\nthose of our ordinary sense organs. Secondly, his ears may have\nreceived sound-waves which, although too faint to give sensations\nof sound, were yet strong enough to start the train of thought\nwhich the words were intended to convey. The first is the\nhypothesis of telepathy, the second is the hypothesis that the\nresults were due to hypersesthesia.\nA good deal of confusion of thought can be avoided if we\nresolve to use the word \" telepathy \" only for a supposed mode\nof communication independent of all known sense organs. If\nthis was the kind of communication which took place, we can\nsay nothing of its properties ; these must be found out by experi-\nment. If the hypersesthesia explanation is the true one, the\nfacts are of less revolutionary interest, and presumably hyper-\naesthetic hearing will follow much the same laws as ordinary\nhearing.\nThe correspondence which has already appeared in various\npapers on this subject has shown that most persons have already\nmade up their minds as to which of these two explanations is\nthe true one, and that they are prepared to defend the explanation\nthey have chosen with some heat. Perhaps, therefore, it will be\nworth while to consider very shortly what hnes of evidence could\nlead us to make a decision between the two alternative explanations.\nIt is no sufficient evidence against the theory that the results\nwere due to sound-waves too faint to produce sensations of sound\nto say either that sounds could only be interpreted by a person\nwho was conscious of hearing them or that this explanation is\nruled out by the fact that there was a large room between the\nspeaker and the person receiving his messages. It is certain\nthat a stimulus may be the starting-point of a train of thought\nbefore it is strong enough to be perceptible, and if this is the\ncase nothing but experiment can decide what limits this capacity\nhas. It may indeed be impossible for thought to be affected by\nsound waves which have traversed two walls and a large room,\nbut it may, on the other hand, be possible, even if the waves\nhave travelled ten times that distance. This must be found out\nbefore we finally reject the hypothesis of hyperaesthesia.\nIt may be possible to find a conclusive test to decide between\nthese hypotheses. Every physical vibration which can give rise\nto a sensation obeys the law of inverse squares\n\u2014\ni.e., if the\n\f54 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April, 1925\ndistance from the source of the vibrations is doubled, these are\nreceived at a quarter of their original strength ; if it is trebled,\ntheir strength is reduced to a ninth. It is possible that com-\nmunication by telepathy does not follow this law. There is some\nindication that it does not, for successful telepathy experiments\nhave been reported between experimenters in different countries,\nalthough the percentage of successes in these experiments was so\nsmall that we must remain doubtful of their interpretation. In\nthe experiments on Professor Gilbert Murray, however, we seem\nto have a subject who gives a high percentage of correct answers.\nIt ought to be easy to find out whether increase in the distance\nbetween the reader and the subject does or does not cause a rapid\nincrease in the percentage of error. If there were such an increase,\nthis would, of course, be no final evidence against the telepathy\ntheory, for the unknown source of telepathic communication may\nitself obey the law of inverse squares. If, however, it could be\nshown that increasing the distance even to a very great extent\ndid not produce a great increase in the number of errors, this\nwould be very strong evidence indeed in favour of the \" telepathy\n\"\nexplanation.\nIt is to be hoped that these experiments will not stop at the\npoint of demonstrating that communication of some sort exists.\nBy the ordinary methods of scientific research\u2014isolation and\nindependent variation of all the conditions under which com-\nmunication takes place\u2014it should not be difficult to settle con-\nclusively all the questions that are still in dispute. Such a\nresearch should show whether the results are to be explained by\ntelepathy or by hypersesthesia ; and if by telepathy, it should\nprovide material for formulating the laws of telepathic com-\nmunication.\u2014Yours, etc., R.

Klinckowstroem, of Munich.\nWhilst in England the phenomenon of the Divining Rod is looked\nupon generally, since Sir W. F. Barrett's comprehensive articles,\n^ Translated from the German.\n\fApril, 1925 The Divining Rod Question in Germany 55\nas a psychic phenomenon having its basis in a supernormal\nsensitiveness of the dowser himself bordering on clairvoyance,\u2014in\nGermany, since well-known physicists have interested themselves\nin the question,^ the point of view already discussed in these\ncolumns {S.P.R. Journal, Dec. 1912) has been further investigated\nand confirmed, viz. : that it is essentially a matter of physical-\nphysiological reflex manifestations. The physiological processes\noccasioned by the reaction of the divining rod have in recent\nyears been to a large extent explained. Concerning this, the\nfollowing brief particulars may be given :\nWe must separate from each other three component parts of\ndivining rod phenomena :\n(1) The hypothetical physical stimulus of the dowser.\n(2) The occurrence of reaction.\n(3) The interpretation of the latter through the dowser.\nWherein the susceptibility of the dowser lies is stiU wholly\nunexplained. Why is one person musical aud another not ?\nIt may be a question of some atavistic sense vestige which is\nperhaps paralleled by the so-called weather sensibility found in\nmany people.\nIn this connection all kinds of more or less vague theories\nhave been advanced in which electricity and radio-activity hold\nthe chief place.\n^\n^ Hans Palkinger's pamphlet, which, was sent to me for discussion (The\nDivining Bod, 192S, Leijizig and Vienna : published by Waldheim-Eberle)\nstands, so to speak, in the middle between the two points of view. It is\na. remarkable little book. Pertinent remarks and observations are mixed\nup with others, which leave one sceptical. The suggestion of the Benedictine\nsymbohc mysticism is discredited, as he shows in interesting fashion, but\nnot dead. But Falkinger's own hypothesis, though not enlarged upon, of\npsychic rays and their deflection by the object sought, is only an intellectual\nstox^-gap. FaUdnger finds all that he looks for ; his divining rod, or one-\nhanded rod, or even the bare hand, gives him the answer to all he asks.\nIt becomes to him an oracle,\u2014like Planchette to spiritualists. And from\nthe twitching hand to automatic writing is only a little step. Falkinger\nis a clairvoyant medium. Whether he really has at his command clairvoyant\nfaculties cannot in any way be proved from his own statement as to his\nobservations, and would require to be made clear by experiments. The real\ndivining rod problem ajspears to me not to have much to do with such\nthings, inasmuch as the rod operates as a detector unconsciously to the ^\nperceptions.\n^ I would venture, in regard to several of the enquiries and views here briefly\ndealt with, to refer to my pamphlet The Divining Rod as a Scientific Problem,\nwith Appendix \"Aids from Geophysics,\" Stuttgart: Konrad Wittwer, 1922.\n\f56 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April, 1925-\nIn recent years several physicists have turned their attention\nto this question. Dr. R. Ambronn, Professor of Physics at the\nGeophysical Institute \" Brda \" at Gottingen, has come to the-\nconclusion, from his own experiments, that the dowser reacts in\nsuch places where sudden alterations in the radio-active conditions\nmay be ascertained by means of special geophysical methods.\nFor instance, in places where there are ores, slag, etc., Ambronn\ninclines to the opinion that the dowser responds to these sudden\nalterations, and that therefore an effect from vibrations may be\nexpected on the nervous systems of particularly sensitive people.\nThe physicists, Eduard Haschek (Vienna) and K. E. Herzfeld\n(Munich), have made very thorough tests at the Second Physics\nInstitute of the University of Vienna with a dowser (Bergrat\nLukas Waagen), and have come to the conclusion that not any kind\nof ray, but electrostatic vibration fields (alterations of tension\nmust here be taken into consideration), to which the dowser would\nrespond where geological strata (permeated by earth currents) of\nconductivity different from that of their surroundings or zone of\ndisturbance, alter the electric field.\nThat would also, for example, be the case with water-conducting\nslag with higher radio-active rays, or with beds of iron ore,\nwhich are always manifested by a considerable decrease in the\nactivity on the earth's surface. The considerations from which\nHaschek and Herzfeld started their experiments, and the con-\nclusions they arrived at, are shortly as follows : Electric currents\n(the earth currents) are always flowing through the soil, as to\nthe causes and laws of which our knowledge is still admittedly\nvery scanty. Now the currents will flow freely into the better\nconductors of the soil, while the inferior conductors will receive\nthem in less degree. This lack of uniformity in the course of the\ncurrents, which has its origin in the unequal resistance of the soil,\nwiU also manifest itself in the state of tension, that is to say,\nin the area of the electric field.\nLet us suppose for the moment that the soil is quite homo-\ngeneous and penetrated by an even current, so that the resistance\nwould be everywhere equal, and the conditions of tension equal\neverywhere also,\u2014the areas of equal tension (surface or potential\nareas) being perpendicular to and at equal distances from the\nground,\u2014the electric force will run parallel to it with constant\npower. Let us now place something heterogeneous in the ground,.\n\fApril, 1925 The Divining Rod Question in Germany 57\nand the resistance will be altered at this spot. If the conduc-\ntivity is greater (ore, water) the state of tension is less, and the\nsurface areas (niveaufiachen) disperse. If the conductivity is less\nthan in the surrounding ground (e.g. hollows), the tension\n(spannungsverbrauch) is correspondingly greater, and the lines of\nforce and the surface areas crowd more closely together. Only\nin a single instance will the electric field not be influenced,\u2014that\nis when the heterogeneity (mineral lode or flow of water) is\naccidentally parallel to the earth current ; then the intensity of\nthe current increases there so far that the condition of tension,\nis equal both inside and out. Only where currents cross the\nheterogeneity is it apparent in the electric field. If one compares\nthese conclusions with observations on the practices of the dowser,\nit is found to be in accord, and a full explanation of many failures.\nIt becomes clear why a uniform reflector of underground water\nfails to affect the dowser, but that wherever there are other kinds\nof water (streams), such places can be discovered by the rod.\nAlso the finding shows at once that the dowser in the case of\na flow of water or linear mineral lodes is often only in a position\nto indicate certain parts ; should the earth current at such a spot\nbe exactly parallel to the supply, no result will be obtained. Not\nthe earth current in itself, the two investigators are led to believe,,\nor its alterations, are what the dowser feels, but the distortions\nof the electric field in which he finds himself. The electric field\nis subject to such distortions owing to any isolated bodies present\nin it. Any alteration of the structure, no matter how caused,\nof the electric field must produce its effect, as also ionised gases,\neven the accumulation of ions in a free field, which would confirm\nthe observation of Ambronn on the co-existence of observed radio-\nactive elements and deflections of the rod in connection with\nmineral slag, etc.\nHaschek and Herzfeld emphasise finally that their explanation\ncannot be more than a first attempt at a physical theory of the\ndivining rod. Only when the material for observation is quite\ncleared up, can one really decide as to the utility of the theory.\nFor the present we cannot regard it as more than a working\nhypothesis.\nPhysiologists and psychologists\u2014such as Professors R. Grase-\nberger (Vienna), R. Sommer (Giessen), and the Dresden nerve\nspecialist, Dr. H. Haenel, have long endeavoured to explain the\n\f68 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Apeil, 1925\nreaction when the rod deflects. Whilst the first asserts that the\nreaction is only the effect of pure psychical stimulus (imaginative\nideas, expectation or even unconscious perception and interpre-\ntation of the peculiarities of the ground), and inclines to the old\nideomotor method of explanation, Haenel and Sommer take the\nview of a dynamic relation existing between earth and man.\nHaenel, who has instituted the most thorough scrutiny of this\nquestion,^ starts in his explanation of the processes from the\nnormal, or at any rate usual standpoint, when the rod deflects\n:\nholding the fork ends with an undergrip, that is to say, the palms\nof the hands upwards (in supination), placing the upper part of\nthe arm close to the body, the rod held with the pointers\nhorizontally to the front, whereby it comes into a condition of\ntension more or less. The greater the power of resistance, and at\nthe same time the more elastic the substance of the rod, so much\nthe more vigorous will be the pull on the ends of the fork,\nbut all the greater too the resistance of the rod itself to this\nmovement.\nThe ends of the fork tend, in this position, to approach one\nanother, and naturally seek to attain this end by the way of\nleast resistance. This is to be found in the position of supination ;\nas the palms of the hands (which were upwards at first) turn\ninwards (change into pronation), the ends of the fork approach\neach other once more and the point of the rod strikes downward,\nand the tense \" muscle-rod-system \" previously in equipoise now\nrelaxes.\nAccording to Haenel, when the rod deflects it is a question\nonly of the yielding\u2014the relaxing of a tightened muscle amongst\na number of others which remained relaxed. It needs only quite\na slight shock, which may be due to a delicate impression on\nthe mind, or even a j^urely psychic condition, to induce this\noutstretched apparatus to relax at any point ; and immediately\nthe latent energy is transformed into activity, the rod jerks\nviolently into a position of rest.\nPrivy Councillor Professor Sommer has definitely established\nthat in the dowser, even before the actual deflection of the rod,\ninvoluntary slight alterations of the muscle tension take place,\nwhich are apparent in spasmodic movements of the finger and\n^ Vol. 8 of the Records of the Society for enquiring iato the Divining Rod\nproblem.\n\fApril, 1925 The Divining Rod Question in Germany 59\niands. In fact, in many cases, a typical alteration takes place\nin the dowser's whole bearing, so that slight ulnar inflexion occurs\nin the forearm. On this there quickly foUows the deflection of\nthe rod. The divining rod is therefore, according to Sommer,\na strongly magnifying indicator of minute alterations of tension\nof the muscle in a definite nerve tract (Ulnaris).\nThe train of reasoning which Sommer connects with these\nobservations is interesting {Periodical of Divining Rod Research,\nOernrode-in-Harz, Nos. 9-10). The same nerve tract comes into play\nwith the dowser as with a bird in flight and with a man in\nswimming movements. According to Sommer, this parallel physio-\nlogical relation points to the fact that in the flexion movements\nof the ulna in dowsers a quite primitive kind of movement is\ninvolved, which man has inherited from ancient times from a\nprimeval method of locomotion which has some relation to flying.\nIn conclusion, with regard to the practical application of the\n\u2022divining rod to the discovery of the earth's treasures, this is\nwithout doubt the problematical side of the whole question. The\nexplanation of the reaction through the dowser, on account of\nthe numerous possibilities of the effect of excitement, easily offers\noccasion for wrong diagnosis and mistakes. From the records of\nexperiments so far before us, definite conclusions cannot be drawn,\nchiefly because the reactions of the various dowsers are of such\nmarkedly different character. This question can only really be\nsatisfactorily settled through long years of practical co-operation\nbetween geologists and dowsers, recognised as trustworthy and\n-experienced observers, which might ultimately clear the matter uj).\nIn this connection the Professor of Geology at the University of\nHaUe, Professor Johannes Walther, has already made an en\ncouraging beginning.^\nNote.\u2014In a recently published pamphlet ^ Prof. Dr. A. Wendler,\n(Erlangen), has reached a different conclusion, based on experiments\nvfith a trustworthy dowser, a First Commissioner of Woods and\nForests. The complex phenomenon of the divining rod cannot,\naccording to Wendler, be regarded as a mere reflex reaction.\nHe has come to the conclusion that we must assume a \" biological\n^Compare his scholarly work, Subterranean Water and the Divining Bod,\nGernrode-a-H. : E.

Considering that it is a\nphysical expert, who at the same time is fully acquainted with\nthe psychical sources of error, who sets forth these rather bold\ntheories, the book may lay claim to serious notice. It is to be\nhoped that Wendler's experiments and conclusions will be examined\nby other experts, and with other dowsers.\nTHE \" MARGERY \" MEDIUMSHIP\nReaders of the Journal, who have followed the history of the-\n\" Margery \" mediumsliip in the current literature as indicated in.\nthe Notes on Periodicals, will be aware that a Committee of\nthe Scientific American has been long investigating her claims.\nThis Committee has now decided not to award the prize of\n$2500 for which she had entered. Owing to the controversy\nthat the case had aroused, and also owing to the natural,\ninterest that I felt in the phenomena presented, I visited\nBoston at the kind invitation of \" Margery \" and her husband\nand have only recently returned.\nThe phenomena I observed fall broadly into four main\nclasses : Auditory, Luminous, Teleldnetic, and Teleplastic. The\nauditory phenomena consist almost exclusively of a voice,\nalleged to be the voice of the medium's control, Walter, who\nwas the brother of the medium and who was killed in a\nrailway accident some years ago. This voice, it is claimed,\nis independent of that of the medirma and originates for\nthe most part at about three inches from her head. The\nluminous phenomena are very varied, but I had only the\nopportunity of observing one class of such occurrences, which,\nconsisted of vague luminous shapes, sometimes upon the table\nand sometimes upon the medium's dress, which faded and\nthen increased in brilliance, a phenomenon which occurred\nseveral times during the short time that the appearance re-\nmained visible. The teleldnetic and teleplastic phenomena\nwere by far the finest that I have ever seen, and if fraudulent\nmust involve a very considerable degree of ingenuity and\nmanipulative skUl, coupled with elaborate and careful pre-\nparation.\n\fApeil, 1925 The \" Margery \" Mediumship 61\nThe sittings are mainly held in the dark, good red light being\npermitted only as dictated by the controlling voice, ^Thich\nwhispers during the whole of the sitting, cracking jokes and\nmaking amusing sallies at the expense of the investigators.\nLuminous bands are worn upon the wrists and ankles of the\nmedium, who wears also a luminous disc upon her forehead.\nSimilar bands are worn on the wrists of the controllers, one\nof whom is usually F. H., the medium's husband, a Boston\nsurgeon and author of a bulky volume on post-operative\ntreatment.\nThe materialisations consist mainly of masses of greyish-\nwhite clammy substance resembling to the touch a cold and\ndamp blanc-mange. These masses often lie upon the table\nin front of the medium in good red light, and can be examined\nduring the five seconds or so that is permitted. Objects\nfeeling like clammy tongue-like fins are also observed, and\nthese appear to seize objects on the table and wave them\nabout. Ill-formed hands are sometimes seen covered with\ngreyish or white wrinkled-looking skin, and these formations\nare all apparently attached to the body of the medium by\nbands or cords, which to the touch appear gristly, and in\nplaces clammy and viscous with knobbly excrescences. I have\nrepeatedly handled these structures and have observed them\nclosely in fairly strong red light. The control of the medium\nappears to be rigid, and is faultless if we accept Dr. F. H. as a\nbona-fide investigator, which, under the circumstances, he is him-\nself the first to admit is impossible.\nThe conditions, therefore, of the sittings, are such that I\ncannot at present affirm my belief in the authenticity of these\nphenomena. If the occurrences are indeed supernormal, as is\n\u2022claimed by the medium, then '\"\nMargery \" is by far the greatest\nphysical medium alive, and for the purposes of science the\nmost important physical medium of whom we have any record.\nIf, on the other hand, the phenomena are produced normally,\nthen the case assumes an importance which it is impossible\nto exaggerate. For then the position of the private medium\nis undermined, and all phenomena occurring in a private circle\nwill have henceforward to be discounted until adequate investi-\n.gation demonstrates their reality. In a case of this kind no\n\f62 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April, 1925\ndefinite decision can be arrived at unless the phenomena occur\nunder the most rigid test conditions. I hope that an oppor-\ntunity for further enquiry may arise, and that it will then,\nbe possible to arrive at definite conclusions concerning these\namazing occurrences.\nE. J. Dingwall.\nTHE GLASTONBURY SUB-COMMITTEE\nReport to the Council of the Psychical Research Society.\n\\_Some little time ago Mr. Bligh Bond came to the conclusion\nfrom evidence in his possession that there existed buried treasure-\nunder the ground within the ruins of Glastonbury Abbey. He had\nobtained reports from various dowsers who had located different\nspots within the ruins where they indicated that such treasure\nmight be found.\nAs he was anxious to obtain from, the Trustees of the ruins\nfacilities for excavation at the most likely spots, he approached\nthe Council of the S.P.R. with a request that they should appoint\na Committee to consider his evidence.\nThe Council accordingly in December last appointed a Committee-\nconsisting of Sir William Barrett, Sir Lawrence Jones, and Mr.\nG. M. Lambert, who after consideration of the evidence have\npresented the following report.~EiT).'\\\nThe data placed before the Committee by Mr. Bligh Bond\nincluded the findings of three diviners, Mr. Timms, Miss Turner^\nand Mrs. Greig, who had been taken over the site of the\nruins by Mr. Bond. We carefully collated these findings, and\nfound that in upwards of seven places, the findings of all\nthree coincided.\nWe came to the conclusion that there was a good case for\narranging an experiment with a further diviner ; and after\nsome enquiries, we obtained the services of Mr. Foord of\nShipham, recommended by Sir William Barrett. He went\nover the ground on the 10th of March, 1925, and he was.\nguided by Mr. Wescombe, architect's assistant of Bristol-\nMr. Wescombe had in his hands a plan of the ruins on which\ncertain lines only were drawn according to an arrangement\n\fApril, 1925 The Glastonbury Sub-Committee 63\npreviously made by us affording a minimum indication of tlie\ndirections in which the dowser was to try for results.\nMr. Foord's results have been collated with those of the\nearlier diviners. He reacted about seventy times in all, and\nof these, twelve reactions coincide quite closely with those of\nearlier experimenters. Of these twelve, eight were close to\nspots found by all the three previous diviners.\nWe do not consider that any reliable data have been\nfurnished as to the depths at which finds of metal might be\ndiscovered, but the indications, such as they are, suggest\ndepths which might prove serious obstacles if excavation is\ntried.\nIn conclusion, we are of opinion that the data already\nobtained present a case for pursuing the search by excavation.\n(Signed) Lawkence J.

W.\nTrethewy, to insert the following letter in the Journal.\n, Artillery Mansions,\nVictoria Street,\nLondon, S.W. 1.\nTelephone : FrankHn 6145.\nIt is suggested that a group should be formed in the S.P.R.\n(see Journal for November, 1924, pp. 327, 328) for collecting\ninformation about the practice of Spiritualism in foreign countries^\nI have been engaged for a short time in this work, mainly with\na view to seeing whether the communications received from soi-\ndisant spirits about the environment \" on the other side \" are\nsubstantially the same in all countries, that is to say, represent\nthe conditions as resembling those on earth. It seems, however,\nthat the enquiry may be expanded to embrace other purposes.\nIt may be possible to indicate fresh lines of experiment by dis-\ncovering the methods used in other places and to throw Ught on\nobscure phenomena of our own mediums by comparing them with\n\f64 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, 1925\npractices employed elsewhere. At this stage it is unnecessary to\ndiscuss the scope and methods of the enquiry in greater detail.\nThese matters may be left open for consideration. At present all\nthat I ask is whether, if the date is convenient to you, you will\nattend a meeting in the S.P.R. rooms at 31 Tavistock Square\non a day in the latter half of May to be subsequently fixed to\ndiscuss the question and will then decide whether you will join\nthe group and undertake a share in the researches. Of course\nyour decision will depend on your approval of the programme.\nThe date will be intimated to you in due course if you reply\nnow that you wish to attend the meeting.\nREVIEW.\nAn Investigation into Psychic Phenomena. By J. Arthur Fiistdlay.\n(Printed for private circulation.)\nIn this little book (to which Sir William Barrett, F.R.S., con-\ntributes a preface), Mr. Findlay, a Member of our Society and\nVice-President of the Glasgow Society for Psychical Research,\ngives an interesting account of sittings held by him during six\nyears with the Glasgow medium, John Sloan. During this period\nMr. Findlay had thirty-six sittings with Sloan, at which he\nclaims that one hundred and sixty-nine facts, which it was\nimpossible for the medium or any one else present to have known\nnormally, were accurately communicated. Of the incidents printed\nat length by Mr. Findlay the first is perhaps the most striking.\nMr. Findlay brought to a sitting his brother, who .had recently\nbeen demobilised ; the brother was not known to any one present\nand was not introduced by name. He was hailed by a voice\ngiving the name \" Eric Saunders,\" which at the time meant\nnothing to him. On being questioned, \" Eric Saunders \" said he\nhad been trained as a gunner under Mr. Findlay's brother, gave\nthe name of the small village where they were stationed, mentioned\nvarious incidents which occurred during training, and the date\nhe completed his course and went abroad. All these details were\nsubsequently verified.\nWe have frequently exhorted our Members to bring to the\nSociety's notice records of successful sittings, and we cordially\nwelcome this report of what appear to have been remarkable\nexperiences carefully recorded and annotated.\nW.

May, 1925\nJOURNAL\n. :\nOF THE '\n.\nSociety for Psychical Research\nOBITUAKY.\n'\nDr. Sydney Alruxz.\nWe deeply regret to have to record the death of Dr. Alrutz\nof Upsala on February Mth last, at the comparatively early age\n\u2022of 57. For tweiifcy-five years Dr. Alrutz has been one of our\nmost valued and energetic Hon. Associates. He was appointed\nlecturer {privat docent) on Psychology in the University of\nUpsala in 1901\u2014the funds of the University being inadequate\nto support a full Professorship of Psychology. We understand,\nhowever, that the University had recently asked the Swedish\nP.arliament for a grant to enlarge the psychological laboratory\nand provide a better endowment for the Chair.\nDr. Alrutz devoted himself enthusiastically to the investiga-\ntion of hypnotic phenomena, and published a large work,\nentitled Till Nervsystemets dynaiHik, etc., or \" Dynamics of\nthe Nervous System,\" which contains the results of his experi-\nmental investigations extending over the years 1913 to 1917\non the suggestibility and nervous energy of subjects, both in\nthe waking and hypnotic conditions. He continued his re-\nsearches up to his last illness, and shortly before his death\npublished two lengthy papers in the Scandvmvian Scientific\nRevieiv for last year. These papers give a summary of what\nAlrutz considered to be the most important of the questions\ndiscussed in the work already referred to, namely, the problem\nof nervous effluence. This problem rightly appeared to Dr.\nAlrutz of such great importance, that an English translation\nhas been issued of these recent papers under the title of \"A\nnew form of Effluence or radiation from the human organism.''\n\f66 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May, 1925\nHuman Radiation.\nMany years ago Dr. Alrutz sent to tlie present writer an\naccount of a prolonged series of hypnotic experiments he had\nmade upon a Swedish labourer whose illness he had hypnoti-\ncally treated with success,\u2014and who proved to be a very\nsensitive subject. These experiments appeared to demonstrate\nthe fact than an effitience passed from the hypnotiser to the\nsubject, a belief entertained by the older mesmerists. I was\ndeeply interested in Alrutz's results, as more than forty years\nago the hypnotic experiments which I made with Edmund\nGurney,\u2014and before that in Ireland,\u2014seemed to indicate the\nexistence of this effluence. Alrutz invited me to visit him and\nverify the results he had obtained. Accordingly in 1911 I\nwent to Upsala, and the results of my experiments will be\nfound in the Journal of the S.P.R. for 1912, pp. 178-188.\nThe conclusion at which I arrived from these experiments,\nwith Dr. Alrutz's subject, confirmed the view which was ex-\npressed in the second S.P.R. report of the committee on\nMesmerism,\u2014of which Myers, Gurney and myself were members\n\u2014and was published in the first volume of our Proceedings for 1883.\nWe state, on p. 257, that our experiments \" make it almost\nimpossible to doubt the reality of some special force or virtue\npassing from one organism to another in the process of mes-\nmerisation,\"' and we record a series of experiments (of which I\nhave a vivid recollection) which appeared to point out some\nkind of effluence passing from the hypnotiser to the subject.\n(See Proc, Vol. I., pp. 257-262.) In conclusion we stated that\nthese experiments, which \" were made under accurate scientific\nconditions,\" constituted a strong prima facie case in favour of\nthis effluence ;\nthough we acknowledged that the number of\nthese experiments must be very largely increased before such\na theory could be generally entertained. Subsequently Dr.\nLiebeault of Nancy, as the result of numerous experiments,\nwas also led to the conviction of a specific mesmeric influence.\nThe therapeutic results he obtained, after submitting very\nyoung children, from three to four years old, to hypnosis,\nled him to this conclusion. Some years later Mrs. Sidgwick\nand Miss Johnson published in our Proceedings for 1890 an\nimportant paper, in which they discussed these experiments\n\fMat, 1925 Obituary 67\nand those by Dr. Alrutz, and from their experiments were\nled to doubt the conckisions arrived at. But Mr. Myers in\nHuman Personality, Chap. V., says it is \"by no means improbable\nthat effluences, as yet unknown to science, but perceptible to\nsensitive persons, should radiate from living human organisms.\"\nSome of the experiments made long ago by Gurney and\nmyself upon a sensitive subject were so extraordinary thatj we\ndid not publish them at the time, but subsequently other\nevidence supporting these experiments reached me, hence a\nbrief report of them will be found in my little book on\nPsychical Research (see pp. 198-199).^ We found that any\nobject over which the hypnotiser had made a few passes, or\neven pointed his finger at it, could at once be detected by a\nsensitive subject, who had been excluded from the room, from\nwhich the hypnotiser had also been excluded, and put in a\nseparate room. In fact every precaution was taken to avoid\ncollusion, or of any information reaching the subject, either\nnormally or telepathically. I am convinced the results were\nunquestionable, whatever explanation might be given by further\ninvestigations. But if such an effluence does exist, it appears\nto have a polarity like magnetism. A knitting-needle stroked\nwith one end of a bar magnet becomes magnetised, but a\ncouple of strokes in the reverse direction demagnetises it.\nDr. Alrutz's experiments not only confirmed the experience\nof the older mesmerists that downward passes produced anal-\ngesia of the limb of the subject thus treated, and upward\npasses restored its sensibility ; this fact,\u2014though imhkely to\nbe known to the ignorant subject Dr. Alrutz hypnotised,\n\u2014\nhis own knowledge might have telepathically suggested to\nthe subject. But Alrutz's experiments went much further\nand seemed to demonstrate that certain screens were\ntransparent to this effluence and other opaque. Thus he\nfound that glass and metal plates were transparent, but\ncardboard, wool, etc. were opaque. One of his many experi-\nments may here be quoted : \u2014Two similar screens of a trans-\nmissive substance, such as glass or metal, were fixed by clips\nhorizontally, one over each arm of the subject. The experi-\nmenter then put a thick woollen glove on to one of his hands\n^ Home University Library.\n\f68 Journal of Society for Psychical Research may, 1925\nand nothing on the other ;\npasses were then made respectively\nwith the gloved and the ungloved hand over each of the two\nplates ; the screens were then removed and the sensitiveness\nof the subject's arm tested. Only the passes made by the\nbare hand produced any effect ; as wool was one of the sub-\nstances Dr. Alrutz found to be opaque to the effluence. A\nseries of experiments are recorded by Dr. Alrutz which appear\nto prove that the subject could not have derived, normally, any\nsign or guidance as to the nature of the arrangements adopted\nin the numerous experiments.\nThe results of my own experience at Upsala confirmed the\nfact of some specific effluence passing from the hypnotiser to\nthe subject, but they left me somewhat doubtful of the trans-\nparency or otherwise of certain screens. I felt convinced that\nany normal or even telepathic knowledge did not reach\nthe subject, but it seemed possible that he might gain informa-\ntion of what was being done if he were clairvoyant. However,\nit is not fair to put the few experiments I made against the\nlong and elaborate researches conducted by Dr. Alrutz. More-\nover, some of Alrutz's ingenious experiments seemed to meet\nthis question of clairvoyance, provided the subject had no\ninformation as to the nature of the interposed substances, or\nwhich were likely to be opaque and which transparent.\nIn 1920 Dr. Alrutz delivered a lecture on the subject before\na large meeting of the S.P.K. ; this was published with numer-\nous illustrations in Vol. XXXII. of our Proceedings. As an\nillustration of Dr. Alrutz's remarkable energy and linguistic\ntalent, the substance of this lecture was first of all given in\nSwedish at Stockholm, a day or two later in German at Berlin,\nthen in French at Paris, and the following day in English at\nLondon. Dr. Alrutz happened to be my guest at the time\nand told me what he had done during the preceding week\n;\nthis was the more remarkable as in no case did he read the\npaper, but delivered it from a few notes. Mrs. Alrutz informs\nme that her husband had recently found a new sensitive, a\nMrs. Mozen, who is a very good hypnotic subject, and she\nhopes that our S.P.R. will be able to make experiments with\nthis subject.\nThough Dr. Alrutz's deepest interest was bound up in his\n\fMat, 1925 Obituary 69\nhypnotic experiments and his researches into \" nerve radiation,'\"\nhe also studied the psychological effects produced by aviation,\nand suggested certain tests for a^dators which he communi-\ncated to the authorities, not only in Sweden but also in Eng-\nland, France and Germany. He attended many Congresses on\npsychology and psychical research, and contributed important\npapers to the Congress at Oxford and to the International\nCongresses at Copenhagen in 1921, and Warsaw in 1923. He\nalso published numerous papers on psychology and psychical\nresearch in the Swedish, German, English and American\njournals. Shortly before his death Dr. Alrutz had finished a\nnew book, entitled Hypnotism and Suggestion, which we under-\nstand ^^\u2022ill shortly be pubUshed. It is to be hoped that the\n\" Institute for Psychological Research which he founded in\nUpsala vriH continue his experiments, and communicate to the\nS.P.R. any results they may obtain.\nThe Swedish papers contain tributes to the respect in which\nDr. Alrutz was held by his colleagues and friends. Prof.\nOhrvall writes that Dr. Alrutz's experiments compelled him to\nadmit the existence of a hitherto unknoAvn radiation passing\nfrom the human organism to certain persons. Prof. Svedberg\nwrites that however difficult orthodox science may find it to\naccept the facts, nevertheless he adds :\n\u2014\" If I am not able\nto agree -with the conclusions Dr. Alrutz arrived at, I am of\nthe opinion that the conscientious care of his work, and the\nprecautions that he took to eliminate error, are of permanent\nvalue in this difficult branch of scientific research.\"\nIn conclusion we may mention that Dr. Alrutz married in\n1903, and his charming Swedish wife survives him. They had\nonly one child, a boy born in 1907. Alrutz was fond of\nathletic sports and of yachting ; in his youth he won many\nof the prizes offered by the Swedish Royal Yacht Club.\nHe was taken ill suddenly and had to be operated at once,\nand died under the operation before his wife could reach him.\nAn excellent portrait of Dr. Alrutz has been sent to us, which\ncan be seen by our members at 31 Tavistock Square. His\nportrait gives a glimpse of the enquiring and eager mind he\npossessed and his genial and lovable personality.\nW. F.

AN APPARENTLY TELEPATHIC DREAM.\nThe following report of a dream wMcli had an apparently\ntelepathic origin was first given to the Secretary, Miss Newton,\nin conversation by the dreamer, Miss Boucher James, who is a\nMember of the Society. We are indebted to Miss James for\nthe trouble she has taken to collect the evidence and for\npermission to use her name.\nSubsequently, at Miss Newton's suggestion. Miss Boucher\nJames sent a written account of her experience in a letter,\nas follows :\nFebruary 2, 1925.\nYou asked me to write you the dream I told you of this\nafternoon. So here it is . . . I dreamt on Monday night, January\n26, 27, without any apparent reason whatever for doing so, that\nwe were going to a meet\u2014presumably. Mrs. 0. was there, who\nis always at the meets, and my younger nephew T. We halted\nat the cross-roads and seemed to change about in the cars, and\nMrs. 0. went on in a pony carriage, my nephew leading the pony\nup the hill. She hit it\u2014which I thought a mistake\u2014saying to\nmyself, \" The pony's doing its best.\" I turned my back to them,\nand immediately after there was a shout and I turned to see the\npony on its head in a very deep ditch with my nephew under-\nneath. Mrs. 0. did not seem hurt. We could hear his groans\nand gasps and then to my rehef he stood upright, but looking\nfrightfully dazed and shaken. In the morning I remembered the\ndream and made a brief note of it.\nMy sister writes :\n\" B. (my elder nephew) had a pretty bad toss\non Monday [January 26, 1925]. They had had a long run and\ncame to an unknown jump which his horse refused three times.\nT. (my younger nephew and the one dreamt of) gave him a lead,\nbut, although B. changed from the original place to an easier one,\nhis horse failed to clear and pitched over with B. partly under\nhim. T. looking round saw the whole thing and as usual was\nfirst on the scene ... he kept on saying, '\nIf only it had happened\nto me instead.' '\nNo bones broken, but concussion.'\n\"\nI quote all this to show the younger boy who figured in the\ndream, though not the victim, took a very active part materially\nand emotionally. ... p_ g_ Boucher J.uies.\n\fMat, 1925 Case 71\nOn February -i, 1925, Miss Boucher James wrote again to Miss\nl^ewton, enclosing the letter from her sister from which she quoted\nin her letter of February 2nd and giving a rather more de-\ntailed account of her own dream. The only additional point\nit seems necessary to note here is that iVIiss Boucher James\nspeaks of seeing her nephew standing up after his fall \" look-\ning very dazed and confused, his eyes very red\u2014suffused with\nred, changing the colour of them.\" Subsequently, on February\n:27th, 1925, Miss Boucher James wrote to Miss Newton, thus :\nI saw my nephew when I was iu Devon and asked him to\n-tell me about the accident to his brother. The only fresh informa-\n\"tion was that his eye must have had a blow, as it swelled tre-\nmendously. I asked him, \" Did you think, or rather, were you\n.afraid his eye was hurt, when you saw him fall ?\n\" \" Oh, no,\"\nlie said, \" I thought he was dead.\" So apparently I got the eye\nimpression from some other source\u2014unless he went up late that\nnight and heard of it. He had not evidently seen his brother\nwhen the eye was swollen, as he quoted Mrs. James, the brother's\nwife, as his informant.\nF. S. Boucher James.\nWith regard to the c^uestion of when she noted down her\n'dream and when she had news of the accident to her nephew\n3Iiss Boucher James writes thus :\nSince I had the Memory Dream which interested me, I have\nkept a book by my bed and briefly note any dream that im-\n;presses me. This is cut from it :\n\" Jany. 27. Dreamt Mrs. 0 and pony and T T. in deej)\nditch, pony on top.\" ^\nThe dream entered above this is marked \" Jan. 20 \" . . . I am\nafraid my notes are very brief and often indecipherable. I did\nnot write the above when I woke, but 1 think during the day,\nas I remember the thought coming once or twice, \" I must write\nthat down,\" and then 1 made the effort\u2014that afternoon, 1\nthink. In any case I could not have heard the news till Friday\n[Jan. 30th], as though my sister's letter is undated, a p.c. from\nJier came by the same post, marked Thursday, and to say \" B.\n^ The actual cutting from the notebook was sent.\n\f72 Journal of Society for Psychical Research may, 1925\nhas had 6 hours\" sleep,\"\" and that was the first I knew of\nanything being amiss with him.\nIf it would be more satisfactory to you to see the notebook,.\nI will send it. The date I always enter them on is the date\nof the morning of the dream (which I had in the night). I ver}''\nseldom wake as I finish dreaming, so when I wake in the morning,\nthat is the date I use. So dreaming on Monday night, the\n26th, or early morning, Jan. 27th, I shouldn't know which it was.\nIf I had thought consciously of either brother hunting, it would\nmore likely have been B. who is Master of the hounds, and not\nT. who is always lending his horses to others, or imagining he is\ntoo busy to go out. F. S. Boucher James.\nSubsequently, on February 8, 1925, Miss Boucher James\nwrote again to Miss Newton with regard to the question of\nwhen her note of the dream was made. Her recollection is\nclear that it was made during Tuesday, January 27th, and\nthere seems no reason to doubt that it was made before she\nhad any news of the accident. Miss Boucher James tells us\nthat she is in the habit of noting dreams of possible psychic\ninterest on the day after their occurrence. The next entry\nin her notebook, after the entry of January 27th, was made-\non February 5th.\nMiss Boucher James has also sent us a newspaper cutting\nwhich gives an account of the accident, as follows :\n(From the Bideford and North Devon WeeJdy Gazette,\nFebruary 3, 192.5.)\nFollowers of the Stevenstone Hounds, and sportsmen generally\nthroughout the district, will regret the somewhat serious accident\nwhich befell the popular Master, Col. B. C. James, D.S.O., of\nStevenstone, in the hunting field on Monday of last week. f\nNear Finnemore Crate, Sheepwash. when the hounds were in\nfull cry and had run a fox for three hours. Col. James's horse\nrefused a bank three times, and when the Master put it at another\npart of the fence the horse came down with the rider and partly\nrolled on him.\nCol. James received a severe kick in the head, and his brother,\nCapt. E. H. James, who was riding near him, found him lying\non the ground unconscious.\n\fMay, 1925 Brain and Speech 7.5--\nBRAIN AND SPEECH\nWe print below a report received from Miss G. Ogden Tubby,\nfor many years Assistant Secretary to the American Society\nfor PsycMcal Research, concerning the difficulty experienced by\nDr. Hyslop during his last illness in enunciating certain words\nand names.\nMiss Tubby sent her report to Sir Oliver Lodge with a\ncovering letter from which the following extract may be\nquoted\n:\n\"\n-\nMw\/r?\/ 24, 1925.\nI have long had it in mind to tell you of a most interesting\nexperience I made note of ui the last illness of Dr. Hyslop.\nI wanted to tell you of it this summer, when I hoped to see you.^\nMiss Dallas urged me to write to you of it, after I had recounted\nit to her. But the time has rolled by all too fast, filled with\nmatters of more urgence, though less interest.\nI am enclosing here the account of the matter I refer to.\nIt may be of interest in the discussion of Brain and Speech\n\"\nnow going on in the S.P.R. Journal, thanks to the attention you\nhave given the matter in the past year, . . ,\nGertrude Ogden Tubby.\nThe following statement was enclosed with this letter :\nIn the course of the illness of James Hervey Hyslop, after his\nthrombosis, he had difficulty in enunciating syllables, ordinary\nwords and proper names, some of which I noted during his\nconversations with me. There were certain variations that were\nrecurrent, although not unalterable, and one became accustomed to\ninterpreting him. The familiarity of the words or names had\nnothing to do with the ease or the difficulty of the enunciations-\nThere was entirely clear memory and purpose in the remarks\nmade, when they were interpreted. The memory was unusually\nfull and clear. He went over all his papers and records, indicating\ncondition, readiness for use, incompleteness, and so on. Dr.\nHyslop's instant recognition of the correct, or denial of the in-\ncorrect interpretation of his meaning indicated in every instance\nhis clarity of thought and reference.\n\f74 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May, 1925\nOne dramatic example he asked me to make public, as I am\nnow doing. He had tried for a day or two to refer to a case\nhe had in hand, wishing to see the papers and make some sug-\ngestion. His daughter and his nurse could not get his meaning.\nHe told them the case concerned someone whose name was the\nsame as one of the Presidents of the United States. They were\nyoung and thought, naturally, of recent Presidents and the more\nnotable ones of the past. Dr. Hyslop repudiated them all. So\nthey appealed to me over the telephone and I went up to the\nsick-room to set his mind at rest. At once I knew when the\nreference was made, that he referred to the \" Hayes Case.\" The\nfather of the lady he also referred to in an abortive attempt at\nthe right name, and I spoke that for him. He sighed a deep\nsigh of relief and the tears rolled down his face, at the release\nfrom the tension of effort to make himself understood. Said he :\nDo you see, I knew it all the time, all the time, tried to say\nit, and couldn't make myself clear. No one could understand\nwhat I meant. And this is my own organism. I wasn't guessing\nat all, not for one instant. My mind was perfectly clear, memory\n\u2022clear all the time. I knew at once when you got the right\nreference and the others got it wrong. Do you see ? What if I\nhad been a poor medium ? Some outside influence trying to\nexpress the same thing through another's organism might have\nfared the same way. But I knew all the time what I\nmeant, and this is my own organism, yet it wouldn't work\nfor me, rightly. Tell them that, tell them that ! It's a pretty\nillustration.\"\nI am happy to avail myself of an opportunity to \" tell them\n\"\nwhat is indeed a very pretty illustration, and a very helpful one,\nof the difficulty in expressing through an instrument not\nproperly co-ordinated for the use of the thinker who is trying to\nwork it.\nSome of the equivalents in Dr. Hyslop's conversation I did not\nnote, of course, as I was otherwise occupied, but of a few I made\nrunning note as he spoke, and the table below represents these.\nThe recurrence of the final sound \" er \" or \" eer \" was notable.\nThe number of syllables and the accent were usually correct.\nSmead \" is a pseudonym for a two-syllabled name, so the count\nis right in that, as was the accent.\n\fMay, 1925 Brain and Speech 75\nCorrect Word.

Subliminal Idiosyncrasies.\nTo the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.\nMadam,\u2014Sir Francis Galton in his well-known work on Human\nFaculty records a series of interesting idiosyncrasies of number\nvision, and other subjective visual phenomena. This surely is a\nline of research which might be extended with fruitful results.\nSome years ago I was present in a circle of friends when jMiss\nGoodrich Freer was asked how one could tell, a propos of scrying,\nif one had potential visualising powers. Her reply was in the\n\f76 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May, 1925'\nform of a question :\n\" Wliere was King Alfred sitting when the\ncakes were burnt ?\n\" This led to our comparing notes, and I\nwas interested to find that my picture differed from those of all\nthe rest of the company who were accustomed to picture to\nthemselves, however vaguely, incidents presented to their imagina-\ntions. Alfred, as I saw him, sat with the hearth on his right\n(more or less) as I stood regarding the scene with the hearth\nbefore me on my left.\nSince then further investigation has convinced me that I, being'\ninveterately left-handed, regard things, as it were, from my left\nside, looking towards the right when visualising, so that the-\ncentre of interest in the picture is on my right. Further, on\ncomparing notes with \" right-handeds \" I have often found that\nmy visualised pictures are, even in detail, except of course when\ndescription defines positions, practically mirror reversals of theirs.\nThe same thing holds in the case of illustrated books : if two\npeople are described standing side by side, I find my picture,,\nwhen I come to the illustration of the author's description, is\nwrong : similarly my people always face the opposite way.\nMy visualisations are not always graphically visible. I some-\ntimes try in the dark to visualise an object, e.g. a rose. I\ngaze at the dark red retinal screen in vain sometimes, and nothing\ncomes. I seize upon the passing lines and blotches and strive\nin vain to twist or expand tliem into rose form.\nWith my attention thus rigidly fixed upon the screen, aftei'\nfruitless efforts I become aware that I have no picture of the\nrose form in my mind. My object in the experiment was originally\nto watch the screen until the rose came : not to force its appear-\nance, or seize upon a fortuitous retinal shape to form a 2^oint de\nreiwre. I then try to recollect a rose form. To do this I feel\nthat I turn my eyes, as the instrument for the purpose, upwards\nand over towards the back of my head. Returning with what\n1 sought (dimly apperceived as a mental image, faintly visuaHsed\nperhaps, but so faintly that I cannot be sure), to the screen, I\noften manage to bring the retinal images and lines quickly intO'\nservice and get a clear vision of a rose, and with relaxed con-\ncentration, watch the vagaries of its behaviour as it changes its\nshape, in the guise of an interested and disinterested spectator.\nSometimes I almost get my rose when it proves recalcitrant\nand will not lie flat or keep still, and a really exhausting effort\n\f3lAY, 1925 Gorresfondence 77\n.and tussle are required to \" get it under.\" The corolla, to quote\n-an example of its behaviour, sets itself edgewise, flattens to a\nplate and spins and gyrates upon the stalk as axis.\nI can do nothing with it edgeways, so with a supreme and\n\u2022dizzy final effort \" I \" swoop upwards and forwards and come\ndown upon it. To bend it back fiat and motionless against the\n:screen is then the work of an instant ;\nsubdued, it takes the\nproper form and leaves come apparently spontaneously upon the\n.stalk.\nThe raisoii d'etre of the recollectivc bending back seems clear.\nI \" am, as spectator of the retinal screen, behind the eyes,\nsituated with \" my back to my head. \" I \" have tried, as\nit were, sitting sideways, to watch the screen and recollect the\nrose form at the same time. An oscillation from one to the\n.other is at once experienced. One can attend subconsciously-\niinconsciously, but one cannot, I think, consciously partly distract\none's attention.\nWhen objects are clearly visualised at night I lose sight or\nconsciousness of the background. But I think when the visual-\nising apparatus is in full swing and the mind is wholly given to\nit, the background becomes luminous ; because at a sudden noise\neverything seems to vanish instantaneously in a phosphorescent\nflash. Light dreams (i.e. in light sleep), from which I have been\nsimilarly awakened, appear similarly to have been experienced\n.against a luminous background.\nE. S. Thomas.\nII. On \" Headsnaps.\"\nTo the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.\nMadam,\u2014In the Journal for January, p. 6, I see some accounts\nof \" Head-snaps \" occurring after or at the end of trances or\nsleep. Surely these as described must be mild forms of what\nare known as nocturnal bombs, well known to many people.\nThey usually take this form : after falling asleep for a few\nminutes, one is suddenly aroused by a flash of light like tlie\nexplosion of a bomb in the room, apparently sufficiently bright\nto light up everything in the room, accompanied by the sound\nof an explosion, and instantaneously one falls into a dead\nsleep. A mild form of this may be compared to a door\nshutting. An account of this phenomenon appears in an article\n\f78 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Mat, 1925\n-on '\u2022\nDisorders of Sleep \" by Dr, J. T. Murray Robertson in the\nJournal of the Straits Medical Association, No. 4 (1894), p. 19.\nHe writes: \"Another phenomenon of sleep or its borders, and\nalso in the sensory sphere, is what has been described as sensory\nshock. Hughlings Jackson has written about it. In the prae-\nsomnic state of fading sensation, but never on waking from sleep,\nthe patient has in his head a sudden and violent sensation, and\nthe forms it assumes may be classified thus :\n(1) In the sphere\nof general sensation he feels as if struck, or that a bolt has been\ndriven through the head ; (2) auditory, a loud noise like that\nof a pistol shot, or as if a broken glass, or a bell or a wire\nsharply twanged ; (3) visual, a flash of light ; (4) olfactory, a\nsudden sense of an odour ; (5) emotional, abrupt sense of fear,\nsometimes preceding, sometimes following, the sensory shock.\"\nHe also mentions sleep jerks :\n\" We all have had the common\nexperience of a sudden jerk of the body as we were falling\nasleep.\" Though he states that the sensory shocks do not occur\non wakening, for the second or so after the explosion one is or\nfeels quite awake, and on one occasion in the daytime I found\nwhat I had suspected, that the explosion was accompanied by a\nviolent convulsive jerk, and on that occasion managed to wake\nup completely.\nAs these explosions generally occur on two or three or more\nnights in succession, generally diminishing in violence, it seems\nmost improbable that they are due to the sudden uniting of\nnerve centres or breakdown of some inhibitory obstacle or a\nsudden change in blood pressure as suggested by Oliver Lodge,\nbut rather in some form of violent and spasmodic nerve impulse\nin the brain. Murray-Robertson states :\n\" These symptoms are\nfound in some neurasthenics in hysteria and most commonly in\nmen too much addicted to tobacco smoking. The analogy to\nepilepsy is close.\"\nH. N. Ridley.\n{A feiv days after receiving Mr. Ridley's letter ive received\nfrom one of our members, Miss Wilkinson, an account of her\npersonal experience, tvhich is of very much the kind that Mr.\nRidley describes. We print her letter below.)\nI am much interested in the correspondence on \" head-snaps.\"\nI wonder if any other correspondents have had my experience.\n\fMat, 1925 Corresiwiidence\nnamely : a sort of crack in my head just as I am falling asleep.\nThis occurs sometimes for several nights consecutively, and then\nperhaps not again for some time. It always wakes me up very\ndistinctly. As far as I know these have no psychic connection.\nMarian S. Wilkinson.\nIII. Brain and Speech.\nTo the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.\nMadam,\u2014In Mrs. M'Connel's letter, published in the Jourml\nfor January, 1925, occurs a passage which interested me very much,\nand which I have thought about for a long time, myself. It is :\n\u2022 . .\n\" Memories which are capable of being put into pictorial form,\nor words which have already been uttered or written, are the\nmost easy of communication.\"\nNow, in my Problems of Psychical Research (English ed., p. 371),\nin speaking of the curious behaviour of the Ouija Board, on a\ncertain occasion, I said\n:\n\" It certainly appeared far easier for the board to point\nto letters than to write\u2014and this is most suggestive and\ninteresting when we consider it. It would seem to indicate\nthat the '\ncontrolling intelligence '\nfound it easier to convey\nits thoughts when the letters were before it, in plain sight\n\u2014a suggestive fact, taken in conjunction with certain medium-\nistic phenomena. ... I have in mind especially one remarkable\n(but hitherto unpubhshed) experiment with Mrs. Piper. A\ncertain lady of my acquaintance\u2014an old Piper sitter\u2014had tried\nto convey a certain word to '\nRector ' telepathically, to be\ngiven by automatic writing through the trance. Several\nattempts failed. Finally, one day, the lady in question wrote\nout the word on a blackboard, and sat looking at it for\nabout haK an hour. The word was given the next day\nthrough Mrs. Piper. The blackboard was in the lady's own\nhouse, distant some 800 miles from Mrs. Piper, in Boston.\nThis certainly seems to show that there is a peculiar '\nmagic\n'\nin thoughts or things that are objectified in this manner.\nIt served to explain why it is that many clairvoyants cannot\nread thoughts and cjuestions until written out on paper. ...\"\nHereward CaRRINC4T0N.\n\f80 Journal of Society for Psychical Research may, 1925\nIV. A COREECTIOX CONCERNTNG THE \" LiFE OF CrOOKES.\"\nTo the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.K.\nMadam,\u2014In Proceedings, Part XCIL, page 315, I reviewed the\nLife of Crookes, and make a gratuitous reference to a book of\nDr. Fournier d'Albe's in which are quoted some extracts from\nThere is No Death, by Mrs. Ross Church (Florence Marryat),\n\u2014\namong them an incident the experience of which Crookes had\ndenied ; and I gave a reference to Crookes's denial in Journal\nS.P.R. XII., page 268, though inadvertently I said Proceedings.\nThe denial however is not to any statement made by Mrs. Ross\nChurch herself, but to a reproduction from her book of an account\nof a vivid deniaterialisation episode in the Annales des Sciences\nPsychiques for 1906, where unfortunately it is cited as if on the\naiithority of Sir William Crookes, instead of on the authority of\nMiss Florence Marryat. Crookes denies having seen anything of\nthe sort : he does not express any opinion about the testimony\nof someone else. Hence that testimony remains unaffected by\nhis denial. I regret that I did not get this matter right at\nfirst : for in that case I need not have referred to Mrs. Ross\nChurch's book at all. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has kindly called\nmy attention to the misunderstanding.\nOliver Lodge.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nIn December 1924 a series of articles was concluded in The Ttvo\nWorlds which commenced on October 10th. The author, Mr.\nLeslie Curnow, deals with the physical phenomena of the past and\nthe articles constitute a valuable sketch of mediumistic activity\nin this direction from 1848. Many references are given to con-\ntemporary literature and accounts are printed of the phenomena\nsaid to occur in the presence of mediums whose names are now\nforgotten except by those who interest themselves in the histori-\ncal growth of spiritualism. The Journal of the American Society\nfor Psychical Research for March contains an account of the\n\" Margery \" Case, partly by Drs. Crandon and Richardson, and\npartly a reprint of the report of Mr. Dingwall's lecture in Boston\non January 31, 1925, which was published in the [Boston]\nBanner of Life for February 7, 1925.\nE. J.

Sir Lawrence Jones in the chair.\nA paper entitled \" Cryptesthesia versus Survival : An Enquiry\ninto a Remarkable Case \" was read by Sir William Barrett\n;\na discussion followed in which Sir Oliver Lodge, Mr. Trethewy\nand others took part.\nAN ENQUIRY INTO A \"HAUNTED HOUSE.\"\nWe print below a report of an enquiry into an alleged case of\nhaimting, carried out by two members of this Society, by\narrangement with the Secretary and at the request of the\ntenant of the house in question, whom we will here call Miss\nRobinson.\nIt appears to be clearly estabhshed that the most definite\nand persistent feature of the \" haunting \" was entirely due to\na normal, but obscure, physical cause, and the case is for that\nreason instructive. In view of the fact that as stated by Miss\nRobinson (see below) some disturbance continued after this\nphysical cause had been removed, it cannot be held as proved\nthat this cause was the only one involved. Since Miss Robinson\n\f84 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Junk, 1925\ngave up her tenancv of the house very shortly after the en-\nquiry took place, no further enquiry was for the moment\npossible. We hope, however, that if the new tenant should\nexperience any disturbance, the Society will be informed.\nThe two members of the Society by whom the enquiry was\ncarried out were Mr. G. W. Lambert and Mr. G. W. Hayley.\nMr. Lambert's report, corroborated by Mr. Hayley, is as follows :\nEEPORT OF INVESTIGATION AT CHELSEA, S.W.3.\nOn 3rd February, 1925, under arrangement made by the Secre-\ntary of the S.P.E., I visited this house, taking with me Mr. G.\nW. Hayley, also of the S.P.R., to enquire into some disturbances\nthere, apparently \" psychic \" in origin. We arrived at about\n10.30 p.m., and heard accounts (in the following order) of the\nphenomena complained of. The accounts are compiled from brief\nnotes taken at the time :\n1. Matilda W ,\naged 19, maidservant, heard slight taps in\nI)ack room on ground floor (used as Miss Robinsons bedroom) ;\ntapping had been occurring on and off since last Friday (Jan.\n30th) ; heard in early morning (7 a.m.) and afternoon ; occurred\nwhile she was alone as well as in presence of Miss R . (Miss\nJl tapped a china Madonna on the chest of drawers in the\nroom in question and the maid assented that the noise was like\nthat.) The taps seemed to come from different parts of the room.\n2. Miss N. Robinson (tenant of the house) said she had lived in\nthe house since September, 1923. The maid (M. W ) had been\nwith her all the time. Before she (Miss R ) came to the\nJiouse, she had had various uncanny experiences, from 3 years of\na'^e (recounted) ; had felt uncomfortable since coming to the house\n,\nand had been conscious of something on the stairs. Disturbances\nh xd commenced since Christmas ;\n(a) on one night there was an\nunexplained movement of two curtain rings on curtain pole in\nludroom ;\n(b) on Friday, Jan. 23rd (when visitors were present)\nthere was a scuffling noise on stairs between 12 and 1, cause not\nascertainable ;\n(c) Friday, Jan. 30th, tapping noises in bedroom so\nbad that she moved her bed to (front) sitting room ;\n(d) Feb. 2nd,\nscuffling noise about 10 p.m. A friend, Mr. M , came in late\nand eventually stayed night.\n3. Mr. M (just referred to) slept upstairs, two flights up, in\nroom next but one above the \" disturbed \" bedroom. Before\n\fI\nj0NE, 1925 Enquiry into a \" Haunted House \" 85\ngoing to sleep lie said he heard sound outside door like glass\npendants (of a chandelier) being knocked together. Next morning\nearly (by daylight through curtain) saw a grey column in corner\nof his bedroom. It was opaque and reached from floor nearly to\nceiling : sat up and looked at it : it persisted an appreciable time.\nHe turned over and when he next looked it had gone.\n(Mr. M\u2014\u2014 left shortly after giving his account.)\nI then went to make notes in sitting room (with G. W. H.),\nand Miss R went to sit in bedroom to see if noises would\nstart. She shortly after fetched us to the room. Almost at once\nI heard a distinct \" tick,\" then others in twos and threes at\nirregular intervals. They continued, whether Miss R was in\nthe f\nroom or not, whether the light was on or not. They were\nvery difficult to locate exactly, but seemed to come from the\ndirection E-P on attached (rough) plan. They were all the same\nquality\u2014somewhat metallic. Miss R thought they came from\nregion of Madonna on the chest of drawers ('' 0 \" on plan).\nOutside window (W3) there was a constant drip into the area\nfrom an overflow pipe higher up. The drip coidd be heard falling\non to paving of area when the window was open, but the drip\nwas fairly constant and did not synchronise with the \" taps,\"\nmoreover it was some distance from the apparent source of the\nsounds in the bedroom, and differed from them in quality.\nEventually we discovered that there was a gas pipe (supplying\nthe gas fire in the bedroom) which ran outside the house parallel\nwith the wall, and at a few inches distance from it (to clear some\nstack pipes). It then turned at right angles, went through a\nsquare hole in the brickwork without touching it. After that it\npresi-mably followed under the floor the dotted line shown in plan.\nAt point X this pipe was in a position to be struck by some of\nthe drips from the overflow above. The vibrations thus set up\ntravelled along the pipe apparently to one or more points where\nit touched the floor of the room, the floor acting as a sort of\nsounding board. The angle at F would be just underneath the\nMadonna from the region of which some of the sounds came.\nWe tested the matter thus. I tapped the pipe gently with a\npen-knife at a point outside the Jiouse and Miss R and\nG. W. H. heard sounds of exactly the same quality as the \" taps\n\"\nalready heard. Gr. W. H. and I then exchanged places. He\ntapped the pipe at the exact place where the drips had been\n\f86 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1925\nfalling on it, and I (standing in the room) could hear taps appar-\nently coming from under the chest of drawers. The \" direct\n\"\nsound of the tap on the pipe could not be heard in the room,\nand if listened for out of the window was quite different in\nquality.\nPlan of Rooms.\nPIPES RUNNING UP SIDE\nOF HOUSE PASSAGE\nDOOR\nAREA OPEN\nTO SKY\n-CHEST OF DRAWERS\n-CHINA FIGURE\nA = Bedroom (on ground floor).\nB = Lavatory (one two floors above this caused drip, apparently).\nC, D, E, F, G, approximate path of gas pipe.\nX, approx. where the drips struck the pipe.\nW 1, W 2, 2 windows of bedroom ; W 3, window of lavatory.\nThe dotted line E, F, G, is the assumed path of gas pipe under the floor.\n\fJune, 1925 Enquiry into a \" Haunted.

H.\nand I had personal experience, and we were both satisfied that it\nwas caused in the manner indicated above.\n^th February, 192-5.\nG. W. Lambert.\nGuy W. Hayley.\nThis is a correct account of the events told and occurring here\non February 3-4, 1925. N. [Robinson.]\nFebniary 9, 1925.\nOn February 5, 1925, Miss Robinson wrote to the Secretary,\njVIiss Newton, as follows :\nChelsea, S.W. 3.\nFeb. oth, 1925.\n1 have returned to my own bedroom, and last night was\nwakened twice by groanings and shufflings in the room, and this\njnorning a glass-like bell has rung twice between 9 and 10.30.\nI will let you know of any other disturbances which may occur\nhere before I leave the house and will not tell my tenants about\n.anything, except the diip from the water pipe.\nN. [Kobinson].\nSubsequently a further report was received from Miss Robinson,\nas follows :\nThursday, February 5th.\nLast night I slept again in my own bedroom\u2014having muffled\n\"the drip on the gas-pipe. At 3 a.m. I was awakened by a loud\ngroaning close to my bed. I turned on the light and read for\nsome time. When I turned it off again the groaning was repeated\nthree or four times. I fell asleep about 6.30.\nIn the evening six or seven people came in after dinner and\nstayed till midnight. R M arrived later and stayed on\ntm 1 a.m. After she had gone I remained up for half-an-houi\nsetting things in order. Just before going to bed I heard a loud\ncrash in the haU. I was the only person in the house below the\nsecond floor. I went to examine the court. Nothing had fallen\nor was broken in the house and no doors or windows were open.\nSaturday, February 7th.\nI came in from visiting several Private Views at 3.30 to-dav,\nhaving left the house at 11. My maid, Matilda W , had made\n.up the dining-room fire shortly after my secretary had left for the\n\f88 Journal of Society for PsycJiical Research June, 1925\nday at 1.45. At that time all was normal in the dining-room.\nMatilda W let me in and we went together into the dining-\nroom. Two Staffordshire poodles which had belonged to my great-\naunt and a small Chelsea figure had been removed from the shelf\nwhere they usually stand and were ranged on the lid of a box-\ntable by the fire-place. No one had entered the room after\nMatilda W had made up the fire at 1.45 until we went in\ntogether at 3.30.\nTuesday, February 10th.\nThis morning between 12 and 1 I went upstairs to do some\nwriting in the room on the 2nd floor in which E. M. had slept\non February Ist.^ After I had been there for half-an-hour a loud\nknocking produced itself in the middle of the room. No one was\nin the room above, and the room below had been empty and un-\nfurnished since September.\nN. [Robinson.]\n^ It would seem from Mr. Lambert's report that it was on Feb. 2, 1925, that\nMr. M. slept in this room, but the jjoint is of no importance.\nCASE.\nP. 295. A Peemonitoey Hallucination.\nWe print below a report of an apparently premonitory hallu-\ncination experienced whilst playing roulette. A first report of\nthe incident was received from Mrs. Boustead, the mother of\nthe percipient and a Member of this Society. Mrs. Boustead\nwrote to the Secretary thus :\n5th January, 1925.\nMy son and his wife have been staying with me and playing\nroulette in the Casino a good deal. The other day they had been\nplaying at one of the numerous tables there and had lost and\ndecided to go home\u2014but in j^assing out, my son stopped at one\ntable near the door and his wife wandered over to another. My\nson idly watched the play. One \" coup \" or throw was just over,\nand the ball lay in the winning number. I don't know if you\nknow roulette, but in case anyone doesn't, I may explain that the\nwheel has 36 numbers round it and these numbers are represented\non the table itself by corresponding numbers painted on the cloth,\nand if you wish to stake your money on any one number you\n\fJune, 1925 Case : A Premonitory Hallucination 89*\nplace it on that one and it is called en plein, and should it come-\nup you get paid 35 times your stake, as there are of course 35\nchances against you.\nWell, he was standing there, looking at the wheel and the ball\nlying in the last winning number, when he saw a second ball (the\nballs are always white) at the ojjposite side of the wheel, lying in\nnumber 34. Very much puzzled, for there is never more than one\nball used, he looked more closely and then became aware that\nthis second ball had something different about it to the other..\nThe edges of it were faintly blurred, although it was perfectly\ndistinct. He shut his eyes and opened them again, and it was\nstill there in number 34, and after a minute or so it vanished.\nHe then began to realize that he must have had an occult vision\nof some sort, and his wife approaching the table at that minute\nhe told her about it. She begged him to stake on 34 imme-\ndiately, and taking all he had left in liis pocket out (which was\nnot much) he put it on 34 en plein\u2014and sure enough up it came !'\nThe incident can be vouched for by his wife\u2014to whom as I say\nhe told it to, hefore the next throw. Unfortunately I was not\nthere, nor at the moment, anyone else we know, but should you\nconsider the facts evidential enough to publish, my son and his\nwife are both ready to reply to any inquiries you may make.\nLeila Boustead.\nOn January 10th, 1925, the Secretary, jVIiss Newton, wrote\nto ]\\Ir. Cedric Boustead, asking if he would send an account\nof his experience wdth a corroborative statement from his wife.\nIn the course of the letter she put the following questions :\n(1) Have you ever had a similar experience ? Or any other\nexperience of a psychical nature ?\n(2) Do you remember any other occasion when 34 was the\nwinning number ?\n(3) . Most people have two or three special numbers which in-\nvariably occur to them in experiments and games in which num-\nber forms are used. Is this your experience. And, if so, does\n34 happen to be one of your numbers ?\nTo this letter Mr. Boustead replied as follows on January\n18th, 1925:\nThe experience I had at Monte Carlo was as follows :\nMy wife and I had been plapng in the Salle Privee one after-\n\f90 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June, 1925\nnoon without any success and decided to go back to the Hotel\nfor some tea. On the way out one has to pass through the\n\" Kitchen \" (several rooms known by this name) and on glancing at\n\u2022one of the tables I saw to my surprise two balls in the wheel.\nI went closer to see what was the matter, and immediately\nrealised that one ball was the real one whilst the other was\nobviously a ball of my imagination, that is to say, the ball, al-\nthough exactly like the real one, was blurred and would not come\ninto focus. The phantom ball, if I may call it such, was lying\nin either number 34 or number 6, but as the wheel was still re-\nvolving I could not be certain which, although I was almost\ncertain it was number 34. (I might explain here that 34 and 6\nare next to each other on the roulette wheel.) I stared at this\nphantom ball in utter amazement for at least five seconds, when\nit quite suddenly vanished, upon which I walked over to my wife\nwho was standing about ten yards away and said :\n\" The most\nextraordinary thing has just happened. I have just seen two balls\nin that v\/heel, and one of them was a phantom ball and was\nlying in number 34 or 6, I'm not quite certain which, but I think\nnumber 34.\" She laughed and replied, \" Then for heaven's sake\nback both.\" I then walked back to the end of the table and\nhanded the croupier some money and told him to put half of it\non number 34 and the other half on number 6. The spinner by\nthis time was calling \" Faites vos jeux\" and had spun the ball.\nI then walked round behind the wheel to watch the result, and\nafter a few seconds the ball fell into No. 34 and I had won !\nNow to reply to your three questions :\n1. I have never had a similar experience, although I have had\none or two rather curious experiences, but which might easUy be\nput down to ordinary coincidence, but none of those happened at\nMonte Carlo.\n2. It is impossible to play roulette for any length of time with-\nout having all the numbers turn up sooner or later\u2014not once but\nmany times.\n3. No. 34 was not my lucky number and I seldom backed it\n\u2014\nZero being my favourite number.\nThere seems to me to be only two possible explanations to this\nexperience :\n1. That the phantom ball was simply a reflection of the real\nball, which is highly improbable, as the real ball was the other\n\f-Joke, 1925 Case : A Premonitory Hallucination 91\nside of the wheel, and I stared hard at the phantom ball before\nit disappeared.\n2. That it was some form of psychic phenomena.\nIf the experience had happened after dinner I might well be\naccused of having dined not wisely but too well ! but the incident\n\"took place at about 4 p.m.\nNeedless to say I looked for phantom balls for the rest of my\n.stay at Monte but without success.\nC. BOUSTEAD.\nOn January 26th, 1925, Mrs. Cedric Boustead sent a corroborative\nstatement, as follows :\nWith reference to your letter asking for a corroborative account\n\u2022of my husband's pecuhar experience at Monte Carlo it was as\nfollows : We had been playing in the early afternoon at roulette\nin the Salle Privee of the Casino, and having lost a certain amount\nof money agreed to return to the hotel to tea. As we were\npassing through the Salle Schmidt, commonly known as the\nKitchen, Avhere one can play in 10 franc stakes, my husband\nstopped at the first roulette table while I walked on to the first\nTrente et Quarante table. I heard him call me and walked back,\nwhen he told me in a great state of excitement that he had just\nseen two balls in the roulette wheel which was slowing up after\nthe coup. He said that one was the real bail and the other\nobviously a phantasm, and that the phantom ball was between 6\nand 34, which numbers lie adjacent on the wheel. I told him to\nback both numbers for the following coup, which he was just in\ntime to do, and sure enough 34 was the winning number. As far\nas I am aware 34 has never been a favourite number of his. He\nwas exceedingly definite about having seen the second ball stop\nwhere it was lying. I shall be glad to give you any information\nfurther than this account which you may require.\nD. Joyce Boustead.\nWHAT IS WRONG WITH TELEPATHY ?\nThe attention so justly excited by Prof. Gilbert Murray's experi-\nments and by Lord Balfour's endorsement of them has led to a\nprolonged discussion of the subject of telepathy in the public\npress, to which Dr. Thoiiless's letter to the Manchester Guardian,\nreprinted in the April Journal, was a most valuable contribution. I\n\f92 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jdne, 1925\nam glad that it has been brought to the notice of members of\nthe Society, and am tempted to improve the occasion further.\nFor really the situation is most instructive, and has vividly brought\nout the weak points in the position of believers and of disbelievers\nin telepathy alike.\nI shall most fitly begin by commenting on the foibles of the\nlatter. Messrs. Ray Lankester and Bryan Donkin are of course-\nfree to disbelieve in telepathy, as no one contends that the evi-\ndence for it is coercive ; but they should concede a right to-\nbelieve in it to those to whom it S66inS Sufficient. Instead of\nwhich, in their attacks on Lord Balfour in the Times, they show^\nthemselves the faithful pupils of W. K. Clifford. It was from\nhim, many years ago, that they learnt the ine Sable turpitude of\nletting belief outstrip knowledge, and yet they themselves also-\nappear to believe that they can 'prove the beliefs which they\ncherish. They identify science with dogma, and will allow nO'\none to question the infallibility of what was scientific orthodoxy\nforty or fifty years ago. So they seem blissfully unaware of the-\nresults of modern reflection on the theory and methods of science,,\nand seem strange survivals in an age which has dethroned Newton\nfor Einstein, and through its scientific leaders declares that a\nscientific doctrine is a policy and not a creed ! Moreover, it is\nnow nearly thirty years ago that William James explained to u&\nthe nature and functions of the will to believe, and discredited the\nideal of a purely intellectualist method of knowing.\nSir Herbert Stephen at first sight appears to hajk back to a\nstill more antiquated attitude. He seems to question the validity\nof pure science itself, and to reject the existence of telepathy,\nbecaiise it has been under investigation for thirty years, and has\nnot yet superseded the more ordinary modes of communication\nbetween minds. So he infers that \" it will n(,\\^er be of solid or\nenduring use to human beings,\" and that \" fov all practical pur-\nposes there is no such thing.\" It is intelligibh; that such appar-\nently Philistine and obscurantist sentiments i.hould have pro-\nvoked a rebuke from Sir Oliver Lodge in Nature for May 9.\nOther disbelievers have appealed to Prof. Coover's researches as\nproof positive that there is nothing in telepathy, although, as I\nthink I chowed in my review of his book in Proceedings, Part\nLXXVL, this is by no means the only possible interpretation of\nProf. Coo\\er's evidence. Still it is clear that the case for tele-\n\fJune, 1925 What is Wrong ivith Telepathy ? 93\npathy does not y( fc carry conviction to several distinct types of\nmind.\nIt is natural therefore to ask who is to blame for this deplorable\nsituation, and diflS-ult to acquit the advocates of telepathy of\ncontributing to it. For it is unfortunately true that they have\nnot yet obtained experimental control over the phenomenon. It\nmay well be, of course, that no phenomenon into which a\npsychological fact )r enters can ever exhibit simply mechanical\nxegularity ; but at present the success of a telepathic experiment\ncannot be anticipated with anything like such confidence as the\nstrokes of an expert player of any game.\nSir Herbert Stephen therefore is quite justified in saying that\ntelepathy is not of any practical use. He is right also in holding\nthat this practical defect has a bearing on its theoretic truth.\nFor it very much affects belief. If telepathic phenomena were\ncontrollable, and common, and trustworthy in ordinary life, it\nwould not be possible to persist in an attitude of disbelief towa^rds\nthem. Thus, though no one knows what electricity is, no one\nhesitates to use it on this account. What, therefore, Sir Herbert\nStephen is really urging is that the belief in telepathy is not\nconfirmed pragmatically, i.e. by its working. It is not yet able\nto stand the pragmatic test. But inchoate truths never can. If\nit had got so far as to stand it, the dispute about it would cease ;\nfor it would not be worth any one's while to deny the truth of\nwhat would have become a very useful and important means of\ncommunication between minds. Sir Herbert Stephen is wrong only\nin assuming that because telepathy is not working at present, it\nnever will be got to Tork. For the history of science shows that\nmany of the force*? of nature have remained obscure, disputable\nAnd useless for centuries, and then been established as true, useful\nand important.\nTo render telepathy useful, therefore, by discovering how to\ncontrol the conditions of its occurrence, is the most convincing\nway of establishing its truth. For it is the only way of over-\ncoming prejudices which will never yield to argument, nor to the\nreport of experiments which the objectors have not seen, and will\nnot observe. And it should be the chief concern of those who\nalready believe in telepathy as a scientific fact to make it also a\npractical success.\nIn saying this I do not underrate the difiiculties of their task.\n\f94 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June, 1925\nFor the truth is that in no matters of psychology have we yet\nattained a scientifically fruitful method of inquiry. Psychologists\nhave laboured, long and arduously, under the impression that, by\nimitatiog the methods which the physical sciences hit upon after\nmany centuries of failure, tliey could obtain a guarantee of scien-\ntific success. After fifty years of experimentation on these lines,,\npursued by crowds of highly trained experts in expensive labora-\ntories, it is pretty clear that this belief has proved illusory. The\nmost successful method of operating on the human soul at present\nappears to be that of \" psycho-analysis,\" which does not employ\nthe assumptions of physics but, in spite of the gravest theoretic\nand moral objections, seems to be efficacious in a considerable\npercentage of the cases so treated. Psychical researchers are'\nconducting psychological explorations in a different direction, with\nfar too exiguous resources in men and equipment, and a corre-\nspondingly modest measure of success. But if they have the faith\nto persevere, they may yet be rewarded by rendering indisputable\ndiscoveries which must revolutionize man's outlook upon life. At\nthe moment, moreover, we have one line of inquiry which can\nemploy the experimental test. I refer to the suggestion that Prof.\nMurray's results are due to auditory hyperaesthesia. As Dr.\nThouless has pointed out, hyperaesthesia would be a physical fact,\nand its processes should conform to known physical la.ws. Let\nexperiments therefore be made with Prof. Murray's auditory appa-\nratus. Let us ascertain how far he can hear, and under what\nconditions : for possibly, with the aid of a microphone, he may be\nable to hear whispers all over the house ! I dare not add, let\nSir Eay Lankester and Sir Bryan Donkin themselves conduct these\nexperiments : for if they had desired to investigate, they would\nno doubt have done so (like Prof. Lehmann, with his theory of\n\" unconscious whispering \") before alleging hyperaesthesia in a\nmerely dialectical vvay.\nF. C. S. Schiller.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nTo the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.\nMadam,\u2014The neAvspaper test reported in the Journal for February,\n1925, by Pvev. C. Drayton Thomas brings to a focus a point that\nhas occurred before but which has, I believe, never i-eceived the-\n\fJune, 1925 C07'respondence 95-\nattention that it deserves\u2014the transmission bv sound-content of\nnames as between the \"communicator\" and the \"control.\"\nAs I understand it we have two telephonists each in call boxes\n\u2014at one end the \" control \" and at the other the \" automatist.\"\nShouting messages to the former from outside the box is the\n\" communicator,\" and outside the receiving box is the sitter to\nwhom messages are shouted by the \" automatist \" in the box.\nNow the normal surroundings of the automatist and sitter lead to\ntransmission of ideas by sound since speech is our ordinary means\nof communication here below. It is intelligible that even where\nspeech is not actually in use these minds may be so accustomed\nto register sound values that they automatically find them the\neasiest means of expression.\nBut with regard to the pair who operate from \"another place\"\nsuch information as we have leads to the beUef that conversation\nis not carried out by speech, nor by any analogous representation\nof ideas by an arbitrary code, but by direct transmission of the\nconcepts themselves from mind to mind. How then are we to\nexplain cases where misconceptions seem to arise as between the\ncommunicator and the control in form such as would correspond\nto conversation between them by speech (under difficulties) in\nthe English language.\nUnless some satisfactory explanation is forthcoming the fact of\nsuch misconceptions occurring would seem to point to their origin\nin minds habituated to English speech ; that is to say would be\nan argument against the genuineness of the phenomena.\nB.

Haschek, and\na medical man, Dr. F. Winkler, and reported by them to the\nVienna Academy of Sciences. It seems that eyes thoroughly\nadapted to the dark room perceived luminescence round a horse-\nshoe magnet, but not round a much stronger electro-magnet, the\nexplanation being that the lacquer covering of the former phos-\nphoresced in the dark. Also it was found that the human body\nwas in fact visible in total darkness. At a distance of two milli-\nmetres Prof. Haschek could still count the number of fingers\nextended on a hand. This was explained by the facts that fatty\nacids are present in the skin, and grow chemically luminous when\noxydizing in the air. This hypothesis was verified by a number\n\u2022of experiments, such as that the light was extinguished by an\natmosphere of carbonic acid and was intensified by ozone. It seems\nvery desirable that these interesting and important experiments\nshould be repeated in other labora,tories ;\nfor, though there seems\nno reason to doubt the explanation given, the case of Blondlot's\nN-rays shows that even eminent physicists are at times capable of\nseeing things that aren't there !\nThe second pamphlet is written by a Vienna doctor who prac-\ntises \" magnetic \" healing and believes that there is a specific\n\" magnetic \" force radiating from the human body. The account\n\u2022of his cases is interesting, but has to be taken on trust, and it\nis as well that Dr. Tartaruga in his introduction to the lecture\nshould take occasion to refer to the experiments of other inquirers,\nlike Dr. Akutz, who have brought forward evidence ol the objec-\ntivity of a human radiation.\nF.

An Apparition Seen Shortly apter Death.\nThe report which we print below was sent to us by Mrs.\nWalter Shadwell who is a Member of the Society and a daughter\nof Mrs. A. V. Thornton, by whom the apparition was seen.\nThe case is an old one, having occurred in 1913, but we are\nable to print a statement by the percipient (with a corrobora-\n\fJuly, 1925 Cases 99\ntive statement by the principal witness), whicli was written\nwithin a few weeks of the occurrence.\nThe case was first brought to our notice in a letter from Mrs.\nShadwell to the Secretary, Miss Newton, thus :\nMarch 22, 1925.\nI have an account written by my mother, Nov. 19th, 1913,\nand corroborated by my eldest brother, Nov. 23rd, 1913, of an\nappearance to her of my father who died Oct. 19th 1913. My\nfather was Canon A. V. Thornton, Chaplain of S. Edward's,\nCambridge, and died suddenly during evensong on Sunday, Oct.\n19th. I could give names of people in Cambridge who knew him\nand would remember the event. I have newspaper cuttings and\nthe Cambridge Review of Oct. 23, 1913, mentioning it . . . My\nmother died soon after my father. She never had any experience\nof the sort before. The points of interest about the apparition are :\n(1) She was very short-sighted and was wearing reading-glasses\nat the time and saw the figure as she would see a real figure,\nno more clearly, but quite recognisable by outhne as any real\nperson would have been to her.\n(2) My father died in his cassock\u2014a fact unkuowji to her when\nshe saw the figure, and she remarked to us, vv^hen she was telling\nthe stor)', \" I can't think v\/hat he can have had on\u2014a long black\nrobe it looked like.\" I then told her of the cassock. The verger\nof S. Edward's, if he is still alive, might remember helping my\nfather to take off his surplice.\n(3) The absence of fear or even surprise which the appearance\nmight have occasioned. She did not wait to see it disappear\n\u2014\nmerely turned round and put out the light . . .\nEthel M. H. Shadwell.\nWe give below Mrs. Thornton's original statement, dated\nNovember 19, 1913, and a corroborative statement by her son\nMr. Hugh C. Thornton, C.M.G., C.V.O., dated November\n23, 1913.\nA Vision.\nI.\nOn the evening of October 20th, 1913, between ten and eleven,\nI was lying in bed at Duff House, Banff. I had arrived there\non the evening of the 17th, and intended staying two or three\nweeks for medical treatment. The room was in darkness save\n\f100 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July, 1925\nfor the heavily-shaded electric lamp on the table at the left side\nof the bed.\nI was lying on my left side, reading a novel, when the feeling\nof a presence in the room made me turn on my back. There\nstanding at the bottom of the bed on the right side was a figure.\nI thought I saw the head and shoulders of a man outlined against\nthe white wall-paper and clothed in a long and shapeless black\ngarment. I could see no face, owing I thought to my short\nsight, but the shape of the head and shoulders was, I believed,\nthat of my husband, and I felt no doubt at all that it was he.\nHe gazed at me and I gazed at him for some seconds. I remember\nwondering what he had got on, and said to myself, \" Well, if\nI were an imaginative person, I could make a good story of this,\"^\nand turning round again I put out the light and went to sleep.\nThe next morning Dr. Spriggs came to break the news to me\nthat my husband had died suddenly while doing duty at St.\nEdward's Church, Cambridge, on Sunday evening, Oct. 19tli, and\nat about 10 a.m. my son Hugh arrived to fetch me home. It\nwas not till after his arrival that I remembered my vision and I\nat once told him of it. It was not till we got back to Cambridge\non Wednesday evening that I heard the exact details of his death.\nDuring the singing of the \" Magnificat \" he had felt ill, and saying\nto a member of the congregation, \" I can do no more. Fetch the\nverger,\" he walked by himself to the vestry. There he said, \"Take\noiJ my surplice,\" and helping to take it off himseU, he sank to\nthe ground, where he almost immediately expired. He died\ntherefore in his cassock, and the long shapeless black garment of\nthe vision is explained.\nIt is my own attitude of mind which is to me so extraordinary.\nI was neither alarmed nor excited nor even particularly interested.\nIt never occurred to me that it might portend death or illness,\nthough I had been anxiously expecting a letter that Monday\nevening to tell me how he had got through the Sunday. It\nseems as though he came to reassure me that all was really well\nand to say that though I would hear of his death in the morning,\nI should have this vision of him to comfort me in place of the\nleave-taking which I had missed\u2014at any rate this was the effect\nit had.\n{Signed) C. H. Thornton.\nNov. 19th, 1913.\n\fJuly, 1925 Cases 101\nII.\nOn Monday, October 20th, 1913, I received a letter at about\n8 a.m. from Mr. P , the churchwarden of St. Edward's,\nCambridge, informing me that my father had died the previous\nevening in the vestry of St. Edward's during evening service.\nThe letter gave me no further details of his death. He told me,\nhowever, that my sister Dorothea wished me to leave at once\nfor Duff House, Banff, to bring my mother back to Cambridge.\nI accordingly left London at once by the ten o'clock train from\nKing's Cross. At Edinburgh station I bought a local evening\npaper in which I found a paragraph announcing my father's death.\nNo details, however, were given, except that he died in the\nvestry of St. Edward's during the evening service.\nI arrived at Banff on the morning of Tuesday, October 21st,\nand at once saw Dr. Spriggs. I had arranged by telephone with\nDr. Spriggs beforehand that he should break the news to my\nmother about one hour before my arrival. My conversation on\nthe telephone with him took place from Aberdeen on the night\nof Monday, Oct. 20th. Dr. Spriggs asked me whether I knew any\ndetails which he could tell my mother. I told him that all I knew\nwas that he had died in the vestry of the church during service.\nI saw my mother a few minutes after my arrival at Banff\non the Tuesday morning. She immediately asked whether I\nknew any details. I told her I knew nothing except what Dr.\nSpriggs had already told her. I then shewed her Mr. P 's letter.\nVery shortly afterwards my mother told me that she had seen\na vision of my father whilst lying in bed. I am not absolutely\nsure whether she said she saw it on the Sunday or the Blonday\nnight. I am, however, almost sure she said it was on the\nMonday night. My reason for thinking it was Monday and not\nSunday is that I have a sort of recollection that she expressed\nsome surprise that it should have been on the Monday because\n(as I think she told me), she was thinking a great deal on\nSunday evening about my father and was wondering how he was\ngetting through the service. I will try to give, as far as I can\nremember, the exact words which my mother used in describing\nher experience to me :\n\" I was lying in bed about 10 o'clock reading a book.\nI turned round on my other side and saw a figure standing\n\f102 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July. 1925\nby my bed. I had no doubt whatever that it was daddy.\nI could see his head and shoulders quite clearly, but I could\nnot make out the features of his face. The rest of the\nfigure was undefined but it looked as if he Avas wearing some\nkind of a robe. I looked at the figure for some moments\nand then turned round and put out the light to go to sleep.\"\nI do not remember my mother telling me that the figure was\nclotted in a black robe, but she may, of course, have done so.\nMy mother also told me that at the time of the vision or just\nafterwards she said to herself : \"If I were an imaginative person\nI could make a very good story out of this.\"\n(Signed) Hugh C. Thornton.\nNov. 23rd, 1913.\nWith, these statements were enclosed a statement from Miss\nDorothea M. Thornton, who was at Cambridge at the time of\nCanon Thornton's death, and a further statement from Mrs.\nShadwell. These w^e print below.\n(i.)\nApril 6th, 1925.\nTo the best of my recollection my mother told me two or three\ndays after her return to Cambridge, that on the Sunday or Monday\nnight (I think the Monday but cannot be sure), as she lay in\nbed reading by an electric light near the bed which was so\nshaded as to concentrate the light on her book and leave little\nlight in the rest of the room, something made her turn right\nround in bed and she then saw my father on the dark side of\nthe bed, looking at her.\nHe did not speak, but gave her such a strong impression of\nhappiness and calmness that she thought \"All is well with him,\"\nand felt distinctly happier.\nDorothea M. Thornton.\n(ii.)\n1th April, 1925.\nMy husband and I were staying with his brother, Dr. C. L.\nShadwell, at the Provost's Lodgings, Oriel College, Oxford, when\nMr. Parker's letter arrived telling my husband of my father's\ndeath in church at evensong\u2014no details were given.\nMy husband and I went to Cambridge the day before the\n\fJuly. 192.3 Cases 103\nfuneral and were at Lynton, Huntington Road, Cambridge (my\nparents' house), when my mother and eldest brother arrived from\nScotland. As we were in the drawing-room at tea (my mother\nstiU in her outdoor things and not having had any talk with my\nsister Dorothea), my mother said, \" If I were one of these psychic\npeople I should say I had seen a spirit. I was in bed at the\nClinic, about 10 o'clock reading\u2014I can't remember if it was\nSunday or Monday night but anyhow it was before Hugh came\n\u2014\nI saw a irgure standing at the foot of the bed\u2014I had my reading\nglasses on but recognised him by outline and I thought, '\nWhy,\nthere's daddy\u2014whatever has he got on\u2014a long black robe ' and\nthen I turned round and put out the light. I don't know what\nhe can have had on\n\u2014\n\"\nI then said, \" He died in his cassock.\"\nEthel R. H. Shadwell.\nWe have also received from Mrs. Shadwell some newspaper\ncuttings giving an account of Canon Thornton's death, from which\nwe print the following extract, taken from the Cambridge\nChronicle of October 24, 1913 :\nIt is with deep regret that we record the death of Canon\nThornton, Chaplain of St. Edward's Church, Cambridge, who died\non Sunday during the evening service. For a considerable period\nthe state of health of Canon Thornton has been the source of the\ngreatest anxiety, and disease of the heart has frequently prevented\nhim from giving attention to his clerical duties. Death ensued in\na tragic manner. He prepared to take the evening service and\nread the First Lesson. During the singing of the Magnificat he\nsat down and towards the close of the Chant he slowly walked\nto the vestry, accompanied by the verger. Iii the vestry he\nremoved his surplice and lay down on the floor, requesting the\nverger to stop the service. Dr. Ellis, who was in the church,\nwas called, and other medical assistance was summoned, but\ndeath supervened almost immediately.\nIt will be noticed that in Mr. Hugh Thornton's statement\nhe says that he telephoned to Dr. Spriggs (at the nursing\nhome where Mrs. Thornton was staying), from Aberdeen on\nhis way to Banff. The train by which he travelled would\nreach Aberdeen about 10 p.m. and it seems therefore that\n\f104 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July, 3925\nthe news of Canon Thornton's death was received at the\nnursing home within a short time of the hour at which Mrs.\nThornton had her experience \" between ten and eleven \" in\nthe evening, but whether shortly before or shortly after it\nis not possible to ascertain. It is clear that at the time of\nthe apparition Mrs. Thornton had no normal knowledge of\nher husband's death.\nII.\nL. 1267. A Veridical Statement obtained at a Trance-Sitting.\nAVe print below a report of a case in which a veridical\nstatement was made at a sitting concerning a recent event\nof which the sitter had no normal knowledge at the time.\nThe medium concerned in the case is Mr. C. Glover Botham ;\nthe name and address of the sitter are known to the Society,\nbut a pseudonym has by request been substituted here.\nA first report of the incident was sent by 5Iiss Castleton\n(pseudonym) to Sir Oliver Lodge ; this report is printed below,\nthe sitter's comments on statements made at the sitting being\ngiven in square brackets :\nOn January 13th [1925], I had a sitting with Mr. C. G-lover\nBotham of 65 Blenheim Crescent, Ladbroke Grove, W. Mr.\nBotham is, I am sure, a gifted young medium who should do great\nwork in this study in course of time, with the necessary help\nof sympathetic understanding. It is in trance mediumship that\nhe is at his best, his control being an Indian girl who calls herself\n\" Lily \" and who speaks through him in imperfect English but\nwith a sweet and childlike individuality. Nothing whatever\nconcerning me or my family or friends is known to Mr. Botham.\nI tell him no names which he has given me at my occasional\nsittings with him nor in this particular one did he employ psy-\nchometry\u2014which in my own case he does not seem to find\nnecessary.\nThis sitting was arranged for a friend of mine who had lost\nsomeone very dear to her, but she was unable to keep the\najjpointment, so rather than waste the medium's time, I took her\nplace. It wiU be seen therefore that I was not seeking for\ncommunications for myself in the first instance, which I consider\n\fJuly, 1825 Cases 105\nis a point worthy of notice. As soon as Mr. Botham was under\ncontrol, a matter of two or three minutes at most, he, in the\nvoice of the control told me that my mother was with me\nlooking very radiant and happy\u2014\" she must have known that you\nwould like her to come.\" After some very personal conversation\nabout a visit I had recently paid to my old home, the medium\nsaid speaking softly\n\u2014\" William \"\u2014\" Will \"\n\u2014[Will is my second\nbrother who died suddenly five years ago]. I said, \" Tell me all\nabout Will.\"\n\" Mr. Will is so glad to be able to speak to you. The mother\ndraws a line round you three to show you belong to each other.\nHe has been to you very often, but this is the iirst time he has\nbeen able to speak.\" [quite correct]. Then\u2014after a pause\n\u2014\n\" Charlie \"\n\u2014 [Charlie is my third brother who also died suddenly\n2>\\ years ago].\nThe medium told me of the affection between these two and\ndescribed their passing, telling me at the same time of their well-\nbeing and happiness now. It was of \" Will \" chiefly and it\nseemed that Will was spokesman throughout. He gave me very\nkind and most natural messages from him about my present\nconditions\u2014how much they thought of me because I had made\nmy way without help, etc. About his delight at the prospects of\nanother member of my family, \" a boy \" about to enter into som.e\nnew undertaking, \" a linking up,\" or \" partnership of some kind\n\"\n[This is the marriage of a nephew]. Then\u2014\" There is a '\nGeorge\n'\nwith Mr. Will and an '\nEdith '\n\" [George and Edith were his brother\nand sister-in-law]. Then he said, \"Do they know an Annie?\"\n\" Yes, \" [Annie on this side is Will's widow, living now in\nSufiolk]. \" This Annie has something amiss with her knees ?\n\"\nI said \" No.\" [She does not get rheumatism or anything of that\nkind]. \"Yes, yes,\" the; medium said emphatically, and rubbed\nhis own knees as if in great pain. I said \"Not that I kno\\Y of,\"\nbut he seemed convinced and then passed on to tell me of an\n\" Edward \" whom Will and Charlie were helping to get through to\nme. I said \"No, I don't know that name at all.\" \"Yes, yes,\"\nthe medium said, apparently working hard to get at something\n\u2014\n\"Edward\u2014Edward [Wragge] \" (pseudonym). \"Oh!\" I exclaimed,\nTeally astounded, \" Edwrn Percy [Wragge].\" \"Yes, yes (very\nexcited). Oh, he is so grateful to you for giving him this oppor-\ntunity of speaking to you.\" [E. P. W. was a devoted friend of\n\f106 Jmirnal of Society for Psychical Research July, 1925\nmine who passed over twenty years ago\u2014I little thouglit I should\never hear of him. He was well known to my brothers]. \" He\nnever knew that spiritual things had any meaning apart from\nchurches and parsons and he never went to Church.\" [Quite\ntrue]. A pause, then back to \" Mr. AVill \" again and his sur-\nroundings.\n\" They are shoAving me a concert room\u2014someone on a platform\n\u2014a lady\u2014tall\u2014she has a basket of eggs !\n\" [This I'm afraid I\nthought too absurd ! Who would be on a platform with a basket\nof eggs ? I think I rather blushed for the medium's inaccuracy,\nand though I put it in the notes I was taking, I dismissed it\nfrom my mind as not a thing which would be likely to be\nimportant or true or which I should be able to place.]\nThen he spoke of a \" boy \" who goes to school close by.\nThe name of \" Gibson,\" which I took to be the name of this\nboy, and other things from Will but not bearing on this present\nstory.\nOn Monday, Jany. 26th, I received a letter (a most unusual\noccurrence) from \" Charlie's widow \" in Essex, telling me that\n\" last week \" she had had a letter from Annie (in SufEoUv) saying\nthat she had had a bad fall and hurt her leg. I wrote at once\nto Annie sympathising and asking her to tell me particulars of\nher accident. She replied by return of post as follows :\n\" Yes, I did have a horrid accident, on 2nd of January,\nand I will tell you how it happened. I dressed up as Santa\nGlaus at a big afiair given to the children of Debenham in\nthe Foresters Hall. I gave each child (200 of them) two\ngifts which were handed to me off the tree, then to every child\nwho passed me again on the platform I gave from myself\na chocolate mouse done up in white crinkled paper to look like\na snowball. I went off the platform, disrobed, and then went\non again to fetch my baslx't that I had had the snowballs in. I\ndid not notice that the platform had not been put back close\nto the wall so my left foot went down, my right leg doubled\nup under me and I fainted. It was nearly a fortnight before\nI was free from pain, but I am all right now except for my\nknees which crackle if I go upstairs.\"\nSince I received the foregoing I have written to ask about\nthe \" boy \" and the name of \" Gibson.\"\n\fJULY, 1925 Cases 107\n\" Annie \" wrote again and said slie is very much troubled about\na great friend\u2014the young district nurse\u2014who is lying in Ipswich\nHospital shattered by a terrible motor-cycle accident. Her name\n(though always called \" nurse \") is \" Gibson.\" At the end of her\nletter she says \" Roy \" is now six and goes to school.\" [Roy is a\nmore or less adopted son who lives with his mother in Annie's\nhouse.]\nI have the letters and notes made at the '\nsitting '\nin my\npossession. No one connected with me knew of these happenings\non January 2nd. In the kind of \" pictorial descriptions \" which\nthe spirit people seem enabled to give in place of verbal de-\nscriptions which are more difficult, I think the fleeting vision of a\n\" basket of eggs \" is accounted for. My sister-in-law is tall.\nI can only think that my brother was doing his utmost to tell\nme of these things which he had seen but which I did not know,\nas his wife and I rarely communicate with each other.\nM. [Castleton.]\nThe above report was forwarded by Sir Oliver Lodge to\nthe Society, and on receiving it the Secretary, Miss New'ton,\nwrote to Miss C'as^feiow^ asking whether any corroborative\nevidence was obtainable. On May 5, 1925, Miss Castleton\nand her maid, Alice Cook, called at the Society's rooms\nand saw the Secretary. Concerning this interview Miss Newton\nnotes that the various details given at the sitting concerning\nthe \" lady on a platform \" had been told by Mss Castleton\nto Alice Cook, who has been in Miss Castleton's service for\nfifteen years, on the evening after the sitting. A letter to\nthis effect was subsec[uently received from Alice Cook, as\nfollows :\nDear Madam, \u2014All the facts of the sitting of Miss Casthtc7i\non Jan. the 13th were told to me directly after it had taken\nplace. I remember quite clearly that .her brother came through\nand said his name was Will and he said Edith and George was\nwith him and did they know an Annie. The control (medium)\nasked if she, Annie, had anything the matter with her knees,\nand Madame said Xo, and the control rubbed his knees and seemed\nsure and said, very firmly, that she had. Then the control said\nshe saw a tall lady on a concert platform, holding a basket of\neggs. One of the next things she said was a Boy and the name\n\f108 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jolt, 1925\nof Gibson. Madame first heard from Mrs. C. C. saying that she\nhad heard that Annie had had a fall and hurt her leg. Madame\ncame and told me of it directly she got the letter. She wrote\nthat night asking her to tell her about the accident and she\n\"wrote directly telling Madame all about it, saying she was better\nbut her knees were still bad. The accident happened in Suffolk,\non Jan. the 2nd, and was unknown to us or anybody who knew\nus. Then Madame wrote asking about the name of Gibson and\nshe wrote back saying that a friend of hers by the name of\nGibson had had a bad motor cycle accident which worried her\nvery nmch. The boy's name who went to school was Roy, and\nlives with Annie. Madame told me each thing in the letters\nwhen they came. I hope I have told you all you want to know,\nif not, will you write and ask me anything else that you wish\nand I will write again.\nAlice S. Cook.\nThe letters from \" Charlie's widow \" and from \" Annie,\"\ngiving an account of her accident (see above) and of the\naccident to Nurse Gibson are in the Society's possession.\nTHE RIGHT HON. W. S. GLADSTONE'S OPINION\nOF THE VALUE OF PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nI HAVE often been asked where the Rt. Hon. W. E. Gladstone's\nopinion of the importance of Psychical Research is to be foimd ;\nit may therefore be of interest to quote the following extract\nfrom the brief obituary notice of Mr. Gladstone, written by Mr.\nFrederic Myers, and published in the S.P.R. Journal for June,\n1898 :\nMr. Gladstone's relation to Psychical Research affords one more\nillustration of the width and force of his intellectual sympathies.\nMany men, even of high ability, if convinced, as Mr. Gladstone\nwas, of the truth and sufficiency of the Christian revelation,\npermit themselves to ignore these experimental approaches to\nspiritual knowledge, as at best superfluous. They do not realise\nhow profoundly the evidence, the knowledge, which we seek, and\nwhich in some measure we find, must ultimately influence men's\nviews as to both the credibility and the adequacy of all forms of faith.\n\fJuly, 1925 W. E. Gladstone's Opinion of Psychical Research 109\n]\\Ir. Gladstone's broad intellectual purview\u2014aided perhaps in this\ninstance by something of the practical foresight of the statesman\n\u2014\nplaced him in a quite different attitude towards our quest. \" It\nis the most important work which is being done in the world,\"\nhe said in a conversation in 1885. \" By far the most important,\"\nhe repeated, with a grave emphasis which suggested previous trains\nof thought, to which he did not care to give expression. He went\non to apologise, in his courteous fashion, for his inability to render\nactive help ; and ended by saying, \" If you will accept sympathy\nwithout service, I shall be glad to join your ranks.\" He became\nan honorary member, and followed with attention\u2014I know not\nwith how much of study\u2014the successive issues of our Proceedings.\nTowards the close of his life he desired that the Proceedings should\nbe sent to St. Deiniol's Library, which he had founded at Ha-\nwarden\u2014thus giving final testimony to his sense of the salutary\nnature of our work. From a man so immersed in other thought\nand labour that work could assuredly claim no more ; from men\nprofoundly and primarily interested in the spiritual world it ought,\nI think, to claim no less.\nHere it may be mentioned that other honorary members of\nthe Society, who were also greatly interested in the subject,\nwere John Ruskin, G. F. Watts, A. R. Wallace, and also the\ndistinguished Presidents of our Society, the Earl of Balfour, O.M.,\nthe late Lord Rayleigh, O.M., Sir William Crookes, O.M., and\nProf. Wm. James of Harvard.\nW. F. B.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nConcerning the Formation of a Group.\nTo the Editor of The Journal oe the S.P.R.\nArtillery Mansions,\nVictoria Street,\nLondon, S.W. 1.\nMadam,\u2014With reference to the announcement about starting a\ngroup which appeared in the Journal for April 1925, I shall be\nobliged if you will kindly allow me to report progress for the\ninformation of any members of the Society who are interested in\nthe subject.\n\f110 Journal of Society for Fsychical Research July, 1925\nA meeting was held in the S.P.R. Library on May 26th, 1925.\nThe chair was taken by the late Sir W. F. Barrett, at whose\ninstance the formation of the group had been proposed. This\nwas his last visit to the Society's rooms, for he passed away\nsuddenly the same afternoon a few hours after leaving the\nLibrary. We deeply regret his departure, and trust that we may\nbe able to carry out the project on lines which he would have\napproved.\nAt the meeting it was resolved that an effort should be made\nto establish a group \" for the collection and collation of existing\nmaterials bearing on the history of psychical subjects,\" or, in\nother words, for literary research mainly on historical and anthro-\npological lines. The scope and method of the enquiry are to be\ndetermined by the group itself when constituted.\nIt was also decided to endeavour to enlist more workers and\nto adjourn the discussion to a meeting to be held in the autumn.\nI shall be pleased to intimate the date of the next meeting, when\nit has been fixed, to any member of the Society Avho wishes to\ntake part in the researches and addresses me on the subject.\nA.

Leipzig,\n1925.\nVers'uche iiber Materialisation und Teleldnese. By Fritz Grune-\nWALD, Leipzig, 1924.\nDie okkulten Tatsachen und die neuesten Medienentlarvungen. By\nR. Lambert, Stuttgart, 1925.\nInterest in what the German speaking peoples call Parapsycho-\nlogical phenomena appears to be growing. Controversy is rampant\nthroughout Germany and Austria, not so much concerning the\ninterpretation of these phenomena, but as to the question of\ntheir reality. Dr. Gruber in his Parafsycliologische Erkenntnisse\naffirms his acceptance of the authenticity of supernormal pheno-\nmena, and in a thoughtful sketch em])hasises the importance of\nthe subject to the scientific man. He admits the constant\nexposures of mediums, but defends some of these mediums, although\n\fJuly, 1925 Reviews 111\nnot with the same vigour as Dr. Schroder, whose pamphlet, Pseudo-\nEntlarvungen attempts to show that certain of the recent exposures\nare worthless. More judicial in tone is the little book by Mr.\nE. Lambert,, which is quite an admirable summing up of the\nevidence, and his criticism of the Goligher ])henomena is to be\nrecommended to those of his Continental readers who so often\nin their works appear to consider that the evidence obtained by\nDr. Crawford was of great value. On the other hand we cannot\nassent to the importance he attaches to Prof. Heuniug's Russian\n\" medium \" in connexion with the telekinetic phenomena of\nMile. T.\nIn his Versuclie iiber Materialisation unci Telekinese, Mr. Grune-\nwald describes in some detail the experiments he has undertaken\nwith Mr. Johannsen and other mediums. In the first part, Mr.\nGrunewald deals with the materialisation of mediumistic energy\nunder the influence of the conscious will, and in the second he\ngives some account of alleged telekinetic movements of a balance\nenclosed in a glass case. These experiments appear to have\nbeen carefully conducted and recorded, and independent verifi-\ncation of the results would seem eminently desirable.\nE. J. D.\nII. The Physical Phenomena of Spiritualism : A Historical Survey.\nBy Leslie Curnow, B.A. Reprinted from The Ttvo Worlds.\nPp. 110, vi. Manchester, 1925.\nThe articles comprising this volume are reprinted from those\nwhich appeared in The Two Worlds from October 10th, 1924, to\nDecember 26th of the same year. They trace the history of the\nvarious classes of alleged physical p)henomena as they have occurred\nsince the rise of modern spiritualism in 1848. Mr. Curnow begins\nby the history of the rapping phenomena and shows how such\noccurrences took place long before the rappings at Hydesville,\nalthough he does not attempt to explain how it is that these\nparticular phenomena became the starting point of the spiritualistic\nmovement. Passing on to the other manifestations, the author\nshows how lights, the movement of objects without contact, levi-\ntation of the human body, olfactory and auditory phenomena and\nmaterialisation were all recorded as occurring with the English\nmediums of the past. How far these marvels are worthy of\ncredence it is difficult to say. Mr. Curnow appears impatient at\n\f112 Journal of Society for Psychiad Research July, 1925\ncriticism, but he omits the many exposures of certain mediums\nwhom he extols, even when these doubts were raised hj persons\nwho were deeply involved in the spiritualistic activity of the time.\nThus he says nothing of the reputations of Colchester, Foster,\nDuguid, Heme and Williams, and it would seem that some account\nof the inner history of these persons ought to find a place in an\nhistorical survey. Apart from these omissions, however, the book\nis an interesting little addition to the subject, and for those who\nhave but slight knowledge of the past the phenomena of such\nlittle known mediumLS as Mrs. Thayer, Mrs. Suydam, and William\nTurketiue, ought to prove instructive and entertaining.\nE.

There were also\npresent: Mr. W. W. Baggally, the Et. Hon G. W. Balfour,\nDr. William Brown, the Hon. Everard Feilding, Mr. G. W.\nLambert, Sir Oliver Lodge, Mr. W. H. Salter, Mr. Sydney C.\nScott, Mrs. Henry Sidgwick, Mr. W. Whately Smith, and Dr.\nV. J. WooUey ;\nalso, Mr. E. J. Dingwall, Research Officer, and\nMiss Isabel Newton, Secretary.\nThe Minutes of the last two Meetings of the Council were\nread and signed as correct.\nThe following motion of condolence to Mrs. Lloyd Tuckey\nwas passed :\n\" The Council of the Society for Psychical Research have\n\fOct., 1925 Meeting of the Council 115\nreceived with much regret the news of the death, on August\n12th, 1925, of Dr. Charles Lloyd Tuckey, who was their col-\nleague on the Council from 1897 till his resignation in 1922 ;\nand they desire at this, their first meeting since his death, to\nexpress to his widow their sympathy in her loss. Dr. Tuckey\nAvas a famihar figure at the Council Meetings while his health\npermitted, and after ill-health had caused him to resign from\nit his interest in the Society's work continued unabated.\"\nEighteen new Members were elected. Their names and\naddresses are given above.\nThe Council filled the vacant place among their elected\nMembers caused by the death of Sir WiUiam Barrett by appoint-\ning to it Dr. Maurice Wright, hitherto a co-opted Member.\nThe monthly accounts for July, August, and September, 1925,\nwere presented and taken as read.\nOBITUAEY\nI. Dr. C. Lloyd Tuckey.\nWe have to record with regret the death of Dr. C. Lloyd\nTuckey, which occurred on August 12th of this year. Dr.\nTuckey was a Member of the Society from 1889 to 1922, when\nhe was elected an Hon. Associate. He was a Member of\nseveral Committees, including in early days the Hypnotic\nCommittee, of which he was the Chairman, and the Library\nCommittee, from which he retired in 1917.\nHe was co-opted a Member of Council in 1897, and became\nan elected Member in 1901, retiring in 1922, when his state of\nhealth made it impossible for him to attend the meetings.\nHe contributed a number of reviews of books on hypnotism,\nand several cases, to the Proceedings and Journal, but his\nprincipal contribution to the Society was the interest he always\nshowed in its work.\nHe was one of the pioneers in this country of therapeutic\ntreatment by suggestion, and his well-known book on Hypnotism\nand Suggestion has been through many editions. We print\nbelow a contribution received from an old friend and a medical\ncolleague of Dr. Tuckey's, Dr. A. Percy Allan :\nWhen 1 was a student at Guy's Hospital in the late eighties\n\f116 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Oct., 1925\nhypnotism, lately introduced into England as a method of treat-\nment, was causing attention and curiosity in medical circles.\nBernheim, Charcot and his school at Paris had made the initiative,\nand the quiet, unassuming little doctor, Liebault of Nancy, was\nworking extraordinary and sensational cures. Lloyd Tuckey, then\nin general practice at the West End of London, had been over to\nNancy to study the methods and means of treatment at this\nfamous clinic. Dr. Milne Bramwell, who followed him closely in\nthis work, gave a demonstration and lecture to medical students\nat Bethlehem Royal Hospital. A party of students from Guy's\nHospital had attended, and, being eager for further study, were\nfortunate in getting an introduction to Dr. Lloyd Tuckey, then in\npractice at Green Street, Park Lane. He invited us to his house\n\u2014a party of four. Among our number was Prof. Sir Gowland\nHopkins, then a student with us. Dr. Lloyd Tuckey received us\nmost kindly, and having introduced us to three of his patients;\ndemonstrated to us his methods of work. We were all charmed\nwith his personality and not a little flattered by the courtesy\nand consideration he showed us. From that introduction sprang\nup a long and intimate friendship between him and me, which\nonly terminated at his death. Under his guidance and instruction\nI took up treatment by suggestion, and he was also instrumental\nin introducing me to the Society for Psychical Research. Like\nmyself and many of the older members of the Society, he was\nnot a \" spiritualist,\" hut rather an inquirer into the phenomena\nthat our Society investigates.\nDespite his fine appearance he never enjoyed robust health ; it\nwas trying, he used to tell me, to spend one's life largely in the\ncompany of the neurotic and mentally perverted, which from my\nsubsequent life I can entirely endorse. He used to envy me in\nengaging in general practice as well, as a set-off to the other\nwork.\nBefore the War his health began to fail, and he was the victim\nto a physical disorder which finally compelled his retirement from\nactive practice. He married rather late in life, and led a leisured\nand secluded life at Eastbourne. I visited him from time to time,\nand assisted him in the revision of the sixth edition of his book,\nHypnotism and Suggestion. During his retirement he maintained\nan interest in psychotherapy and psychical research, but was diffi-\ndent of expressing an 02)inion on the newer methods of the\n\fOct., 1925 Obituary 117\nformer, as he had had no practical experience. He met his\ndeath with extraordinary patience and equanimity, and was de-\nvotedly attended by his wife until the end.\nA. Percy Allan.\nII. Mr. Fritz Grunewald.\nThrough the death of Mr. Fritz Grunewald in Berlin in\nJuly 1925, Psychical Research has lost one of its most energetic\nworkers in the field of the physical phenomena. Mr. Grunewald,\nwhose early training in engineering specially fitted him for\nthe task, was one of the pioneers in the work of devising\nsuitable devices for mechanically registering the forces respons-\nible for the physical phenomena of the seance room. Although\nnot a member of the Society, Mr. Grunewald was in friendly\ntouch with several of the officers and corresponded a good deal\nconcerning Continental afiairs. Mr. Grunewald possessed a well\nequipped private laboratory and a review of his book describing\nhis apparatus was published in the Journal for May, 1923,\npp. 286-290.\nCASES.\nL. 1268. I. Information given through Automatic Writing\nConcerning Facts op which the Automatist had no\nNormal Knowledge.\nMr. Charles Thornton who had previously had some corres-\npondence and conversation with Miss Newton about some\nautomatic script of his own which may have been veridical\nthough we have not the necessary evidence to prove it, wrote\nto her as follows, from the St. James' Club, Piccadilly, on\nJanuary 14, 1924.\n. . . About the end of September last I was invited by two\nsisters to try and get into touch with their mother by automatic\nwriting.\nThe old lady with whom I had been well acquainted in the\ncourse of the last half dozen years, had died about 1 month\nprevious to the sitting [after long illness].\nThe short script that resulted contained two points of interest.\nIt terminated with :\n\" Will you please try and get into touch\nwith me another time as I have now To go to mother.\"\n\f118 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Oct., 1925\nThe daughters informed me that the expression underlined\n[above] was constantly used by her during her last illness. . . .\nI am as confident as it is possible to be that I had never heard\nher use those words. However, that might conceivably be set\ndown as an instance of \" unconscious memory \" or telepathy.\nThe second point is not susceptible of either of these explanations.\nAs usual in these cases I asked for evidence of identity, though\nin all the circumstances I had very little hope of getting it\ndefinitely. I cannot quote the script accurately from memory\n. . . but the reply alluded to an old gold pencil ... in \" my\nbed-room.\" . . . Neither of the sisters had any recollection of\nseeing their mother with such a pencil. However, when I was\nat the house last night I was interested to hear that quite recently\n. . . had been found [in a concealed drawer of a dressing case]\nthat had been in their mother's room ... a broken gold pencil\nthat had evidently been put away there at some time or other\nas useless.\nMr. Thornton had lost or destroyed the original script\nbut had left a copy of it with Miss Sidgwick, from which\nthe following is again copied.\n\" Give my love to my daughters. All is well.\" (Question.\nDid you suffer pain ?)\n\" No. I want to go down to old\nassociations and old friends.\" (Question. Can you give me a\nproof of identity ?)\n\" Upstairs is a gold pen which I had made\ninto a pencil case when I was in G[illegible] Square. Gold pencil-\ncase in my bedroom. All is well and I am very happy and all\nthe people I have any fondness for are here and are round me.\nWill you please to come and try to get into touch with me\nanother time for I go away to-night to mother. Good night.\"\nIn a further letter, dated January 21, 1924, Mr. Thornton\nquoted the passage about the gold pencil case, which he\nhad by this time verified and added :\nG[illegible) Square turned out to be Gloucester Square. At\nthe time of getting the [script] I had no idea that the family\nhad ever lived at any other address than CoUingham Road.\nMy attempt at Gloucester was an undecipherable blur and the\nword Square puzzled me to account for it. They left that address\nin 1897.\nLast night with a view to clearing up this point I broke my^\n\fOct., 1925 Cases 119\nusual rule ^ and sat again. In response to a question about\nthe pencil case I got tlie following from my father\u2014my '\ncontrol.'\nYes, a gold pencil case was made for her by a goldsmith of\nthe name of AUwood [or Attwood], AUwood in a quarter of\nLondon which is now pulled down but was in the neighbourhood\nof G. (again nearly undecipherable though I now knew the refer-\nence) Square.\nThis account is of course too vague to be verifiable, especi-\nally as the two daughters have no recollection of hearing\nof a goldsmith called AUwood or Attwood. Mr. Thornton\nreferred us for corroboration of the case to the ladies con-\ncerned. They are two Misses Sidgwick, cousins of Professor\nHenry Sidgwick, on learning which Mrs. Henry Sidgwick\nwrote to them, and later called and talked the circumstances\nover with them. Miss Maude Sidgwick wrote from 25 Colling-\nham Koad, S.W. 5, on January 26th, 1924 :\n... I should like to give you all the help I can concerning\nit. We have known Mr. Thornton about three years, and are\nvery intimate with him. We did not ask him to try and com-\nmunicate with mother, but I said to him that I wished it was\npossible and then he offered to try. During the last year, or\nrather longer, of mother's life, this phrase \" I must go to my\nmother,\" was constantly uttered by her (she believed her mother\nto be alive), but I do not think Mr. Thornton ever heard her\n[use] it. Usually she only said it before [my sister] and me,\nbut not always, as she has often said it to her old friend Mrs.\nC , and now and then to casual callers. Mr. Thornton says\nhe has no recollection of having heard it, but I suppose it is\njust possible that subconsciously he has heard it ? On the other\nhand, when he was reading over what he had written, he read\nthe phrase thus, \" I must go to another,\" and I suggested that\nit might be meant for \" Mother,\" and he then said that the\nfirst letter of the word was badly formed and was much more\nlike an M than an AN ;\nshowing that he had not got the phrase\nthe least bit in his mind when he wrote it.\nThis was, I should say, about three weeks after my mother's\ndeath, which was on September 15 [1923].\n^ Owing to continued psychic warnings Mr. Thornton had given up sitting\nfor automatic writing on the grounds of his health.\n\f120 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Oct., 1925\nA bit of evidence which I thought very important was his\nsaying that \" the pencil case was upstairs at G Square.\"\nMr. Thornton could not read this word, and thought it might\nbe Gordon, but I at once suggested Gloucester, as we lived there\nfor so many years. Now Mr. Thornton had no idea of this.\nThe incident of the gold pencil case was in reply to the question\nwe put, \" Can you give us a proof of identity ?\n\"\n[My sister] and I searched in my mother's dressing case and\nfound a small gold pencil, of the screwing up kind. We had no\nidea it was there.\nI might add that Mr. Thornton is quite convinced that the\nwriting is a genuine communication. I myself think the \" G\nSquare \" the most unexplainable bit.\nIt is of some interest to note that the supposed com-\nmunicator in this case, Mrs. Edward Sidgwick, was for many\nyears an Associate of the S.P.K., and used often to attend\nour meetings. Her name appears in the first published List\nof Members and Associates.\nL. 1269. 11. A Telepathic Dream.\nWe have received from Mss Ida Wild, an Associate of the\nSociety, the following account of an apparently telepathic\ndream. Miss Wild wrote to the Editor, Mrs. Salter, as\nfollows :\nOld Labkshayes,\nDalwood, Kilmington, Devon.\n21th Novemler, 1924.\nThe enclosed papers cannot be dignified by the name of \" case,\"\nbut I send them as a sample of the dreams which are more and\nmore frequently \" happening \" to my sister and me.\nI must say first we are much attached and intimately ac-\nquainted with each other's lives and even thoughts, but we are\nnot often together. This is my sister's home, equally with mine,\nbut she is much away. However, her greatest interest is here\nwith me, the animals we keep, the villagers, etc. And we both\nwrite fully and minutely of the most trivial \" ha'penny-farthing\n\"\nmatters to each other.\nWe are both dreamers. She in her sleep and I in a sort of\nhypnagogic flash vision have views and knowledge of happenings\n\fOct., 1925 Cases 121\nvery like what is happening to the other. I think you will\nunderstand, b\\it I am not able to express it clearly. I have\nfrom time to time asked her to note her dreams when remembered,\nbut she is a very busy woman, with other people about her,\nand has no opportunity. Now and again she makes a brief note,\nas in the enclosed case, and before I have written. Too often my\nletters cause her to say \" I dreamt so-and-so some nights ago,\"\nwhich makes the matter valueless.\nSome weeks ago\u2014I am sorry I did not keep her letter\u2014she\nwrote that she had had a beastly dream ; she was here, and\nfoimd in a nest-box a rat's litter, and she was squashing the\nyoung rats with a stick. I had not written then what had\nactually happened to me\u2014I had seen an aged or sick rat slowly\nstrolling across the yard and had smashed it with an iron crow.\nYou see what I mean by \" nearly the same.\" Rat-killing is not\na daily job. This is the only rat I've ever slain by hand. Her\ndream is very apposite. . . . Ida Wild.\nP.S.\u2014Anything important never seems to crop up in our dreams.\nWhen I had a serious accident, and when she was ill, the ordinary\nphysical means of communication had to be fallen back on ;\nalthough, in my case, I made desperate efforts to \" let Ann know,\"\n^< as I was lying helpless.\nTogether with this letter Miss Ida Wild enclosed the first\npage of a letter from her sister, as follows :\n... I could come next week if it would be of any help. Am\nI dreaming that you want to go to the dentist ? I can't find it\nin any of your letters but it is stuck in my mind that you said\n^ you would have to see the dentist. I am having short and\nvivid [dreams] now, so it may be one of them, though mostly my\ndreams have the goats in them ....\nMiss Ida Wild also enclosed her own statement as to what\nhad actually occurred, as follows :\n'2,1th November, 1924.\nOn Monday or Tuesday [November 24, 25], I broke the stopping\nin a tooth, and wrote to the dentist for an appointment. I\niave not yet (Thursday) had his reply.\nI never told my sister of the incident.\nShe has no reason to suspect dental trouble. I have teeth like\na negro, and my last visit to a dentist was 1920 (I believe).\n\f122 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Oct., 1925\nThat last visit was to Exeter, as then (my sister being here\nat the time) no qualified man was handier to us here. My sister\nprobably knows, but has not remembered, that a qualified man\nfrom Lyme now visits Axminster three days a fortnight, much\nhandier for us. She has had no dealings with the Axminster\ndentist so probably thinks I should (in need) travel to Exeter.\nI could not go to a dentist at Exeter without elaborate arrangements,\nthree miles by road each end of the train-journey, and with a\nherd of stall-fed goats I can't get away\u2014hence her suggestion to\ncome home. Ida Wild.\nL. 1270. III. A Telepathic Impression.\nWe print below a case of apparent telepathy. The case came\nto us originally through Sir William Barrett to whom the\nletters from the percipient and her husband were addressed.\nA first report of the incident was contained in a letter from\nMajor-General Guthrie Smith, as follows\n:\n21sf December, 1914 [in error for 1924].\nI have been interested by the correspondence in The Times\non the subject of \" telepathy \" and it occurs to me that you\nmight care to hear of the following curious case.\nAbout eighteen months ago my wife and I were staying for a few\ndays in a small village in Switzerland. One morning, while we\nwere taking a short walk before lunch my wife suddenly said\nto me, \"I wonder what became of 'A. B.,' he was such a great\nfriend of '\nR.' (our son who was killed in 1914). Ah well, I\nsuppose he was killed like all the others.\" On returning to the\nhotel and while standing in the verandah, a young man came up\nto me and said : \"I don't know if you remember me. Sir, I am\n'\nA. B.'\n\"\nHe had been staying in a small town some 4 or 5 miles\ndistant and had come over to play tennis with some friends in\nour hotel.\nThis seems to me too remarkable to be classed as a mere\ncoincidence, especially as neither my wife nor I can recollect\nhaving spoken of 'A. B. '\nin the previous 5 years and had not\nbeen talking of the war during our walk.\nH. Guthrie Smith,\n{Maj. -General).\n\fOct., 1925 Cases\nIn reply to this letter Sir William Barrett wrote asking for\na corroborative statement from Mrs. Guthrie Smith, and also\nfor permission to print the case in the Journal. He received\nthe following reply\n:\nDecember, 25th [1924].\nMy husband asks me to write and thank you for your letter\nand to say we have no objection to your sending his letter to\nthe S.P.R. Journal. We were both very much struck at the time\nby the curious occurrence which he described to you. We were\nstaying at the time at Oberhofen and were about ^ a mile from\nthe hotel when I spoke of '\nA.B.' The time I made the remark\nmust have been soon after '\nA. B.'s arrival at our hotel from\nThun where he was staying. '\nA. B.' is Mr. J G who on\ndemobiUzation became a magistrate in Nigeria and of whom we\nhad completely lost sight ; he was a very great friend of my\nson's. I had not spoken or thought of him for a very long\ntime, and I was completely taken aback when I saw him come\nup and speak to my husband. Agnes E. Guthrie Smith.\nL. 1271. IV. Two Coincidental Dreams.\nWe print below a report of two coincidental dreams, which\nhas been sent to us by one of the dreamers, Mr. Theodore\nBesterman, who is a Member of this Society ; the other dreamer\nwas his wife. Mr. Besterman writes thus :\nSth of June, 1925.\nDuring the night of Sunday, the 7th of June, 1925, I had a\ndream the details of which I do not remember, but the essence\nof which is as follows : 1 found myself in a room with an elderly\nwoman and two men. 1 was aware that this woman suffered from\ndevil-seeing delusions ;\nduring the course of the dream she was\novercome by these delusions, and, mistaking me (as I hope) for\na devil, charged at me full tilt. She was prevented from doing\nme an injury by the two men, but each moment she appeared\nto be about to break loose. Her movements and features became\nso horrible and the atmosphere of the place so full of menace\nthat 1 seemed to faint. When I recovered I wandered round the\nplace in a sort of icy terror ; at this point I was awakened by\nrather dreadful screams from my wife : she was waking from a\nnightmare which she at once described to me. Under the circum-\n\f124 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Oct., 1925\nstances I cannot remember tlie details of what she told me and\nhave asked her to make an independent statement. My recollec-\ntion is that in her dream she was warned against associating\nwith a certain family ; that she ignored the warning and found\nherseli in the company of that family ; one of them, a man,\nseemed an unpleasant person : he had a black eye, and as he\nwas unable to explain this satisfactorily my wife began to fear\nthat he was a devil ! She began to sing The Gij)sy's Warning,\nand on coming to some words about a devil pointed at him-\nThe man's face became contorted with fury and he sprang at the\ndreamer, who awoke in the manner described.\nA few notes seem called for. The effect of my wife's dream\nis shown by her screams, certainly the worst that I have ever\nheard (though she tells me they are the usual product of a\nnightmare), and by her prostration on awakening. Of the effect\nof my own dream I can only add to what I have already said\nthat when I awoke I found myself bathed in perspiration. To\nmake the fact that we both dreamed of devils in this unpleasant\nmanner of more than usual interest the following facts should be\nnoted. We neither of us remember ever having dreamed of devils\nbefore. My wife has had a few nightmares before : two or three\ntimes after her father's death and once after her mother's. In\nthese cases the father or mother appeared in the dream ; it is\nvv'orth noting that The Gipsy's Warning used to be a sort of\nstandard joke in my wife's family. I do not recollect ever having\nhad a nightmare. I ought to add that neither my wife nor I\nare aware of any psychical phenomenon ever having occurred in\nconnexion with us. During the day we had not read or discussed\nanything devilish ;\nmy wife having read Mr. Galsworthy's Forsyte\nSaga and I the Observer newspaper and the larger part of Mrs.\nLeaning's essay on hypnagogic phenomena in the Proceedings.\nWe are both vegetarians and very light eaters ; between our\ndinner at 7.30 and our going to bed at 11 we had eaten or\ndrunk nothing beyond half a glass of lime juice each. (It is true\nthat our dinner had consisted in part of a rice curry, but our\ndevils were not hot, only horrible. Besides we have had this\ndisli before without similar results.) We awoke about 1.50 a.m.\nI think it useless to add the usual assertion that we are both\nsane, sensible, critical persons, as such statements naturally carry\nlittle conviction to those who do not know the narrators.\n\fOct., 1925 Cases 125\nThe obvious explanation of these dreams is, of course, telepathy;\nbut it should be noted that the dreams were practically simul-\ntaneous. I prefer to venture no theory. Finally, this case is of\nno value as evidence, since in the nature of the case it depends\non our unsupported testimony. It .should however be of some\ninterest to the converted. All the above was written before I\nsaw my wife's accoimt of her dream, which follows, nor had she\nseen my account.\nMrs. Besterman's Statement.\n\" I dreamed I was with some friends (men)\u2014quite unknown to\nme\u2014on a visit to some people, also unknown to me and also all\nmen. We were talking and having some sort of experimental\ngames in which we used bottles and basins\u2014all very hazy. One\nof my friends whispered to me '\nI don't think these men are\nquite . . .\n'\nI either didn't hear the word or he left of? at '\nquite.'\nI whispered back '\nOh. they're all right.' After some time\u2014it\nseemed that I had been there overnight and was waking u]) after\nsleeping\u2014one of the men came towards me ; I looked straight at\nhim and saw that his left eye was very swollen and black and\nblue. I asked him '\nHow did you get that black eye ?\n'\nHe\nstared hard at me and replied '\nNever yoa mind.' I had a feeling\nof great fear and suddenly felt he was a devil. One of my\nfriends\u2014they were all standing behind me\u2014said, '\nSing The\nGipsy's Warning,' and I immediately started to sing loudly '\nLady,\nonce there lived a maiden. Pure and sweet and like thee fair,'\nand went on to a line (I do not know whether it is in the actual\nsong or not), '\nAnd in heaven there dwells . . .\n'\nAt this point of\nthe song the words should have been, it seemed to me, '\nan\nangel,' hut I pointed my finger straight at him and sang in a\nvery loud voice '\na devil,' and, as I said the word devil, his eyes\nblazed up horribly. He seemed to grow longer and curve back-\nwards and made as if to descend upon me ; in terrific fear I\nstarted crying and wailing loudly and woke up in great agitation,\nmaking horrible wailing cries, and feeling as if I were still\nsurrounded by devils.\nI told my husband this dream on waking and have not\nrepeated it to him. I wrote this account before seeing his, which,\nis correct in the parts referring to me.\"\nHenrietta Besteeman.\nTheodore Bestermaiv'.\n\f126 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Oct., 1!>23\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nI. CONCEENING THE TRANSMISSION OF NaMES IN\nTrance-Mediumship.\nTo the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.\nJune 23r(Z, 1925.\nMadam,\u2014The point raised by your correspondent, B. G. Bouwens,\nin this month's issue of the Journal (Vol. XXII, p. 94) deals with\nthe point of the transmission of names during trance-mediumship,\nand the nature of the means used. The analogy drawn from the\nfour telephonists that he puts forward, is useful in so far as it\nrepresents the four individuals concerned in the attempt at\ncommunication ; the pair who operate from \" another place,\" as\nyour correspondent puts it, that is, the communicator, and the\ncontrol, and the two who are concerned with our end of the\nbusiness, namely the automatist and the sitter. But one important\naspect of the proceeding has been overlooked in this figure of\nspeech. It is that three of those concerned in communicating\nare functioning on the physical plane, because the personality of\nthe control is, for the time, so largely merged in the physical\norganism of the medium, that it may be said to be receiving\nimpressions from \" the other side,\" under many, if not all, of\nthe limitations that are suffered by the medium and the sitter,\nwho are in the flesh. This explains those cases where confusion\nresults, taking such form corresponding to mistakes that arise,\nin conversation, held under difficulties, through the ordinary\nchannel of speech. Of this merging of the control with the\norganism of the medium, Feda often gives interesting proof-\nShe appears to be both listening, and receiving impressions, as if\nfunctioning on two planes of consciousness ; her touch with one\nworld, so to speak, both coloured and limited by her contact\nwith the other.\nTake the case put on record in the volume called Survival (published\nby Putnam & Co.), where the communicator was giving the name\n\" Broadbent \" to the control. What actually passed through\nappeared in Feda's words as \" broad man, broad shoulders, a\nbroad head ;\naltogether broad-looking, he says.\" Here is obviously\na case of impression rather than of mis-hearing by the control\n;\na name is given by the communicator, probably re-iterated for\ngreater force ; it is received by the control, and passed on in the\n\fOct., 1925 Correspondence 127\nform of an adjective. Or you may take it as a case of mis-\nhearing ; but then you must say it was mis-heard, because of the\nphysical limitation imposed on the control by the very nature of\nher work.\nAgain, I have known Feda say she cannot see the particular person\nbrought by the communicator \" because he is not far enough into\nthe physical,\" for her to do so.\nThe \" four telephonists,\" therefore, as an analogy, is inaccurate\nunless we figure three of them operating by means of sound-values\nand one by the transference of thought. Pamela Grey.\nII. Extended Telepathy.\nTo the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.\nMadam,\u2014I don't know how the interesting case reported in the\nJournal for July (L. 1207) may be officially classed, but to me it\nlooks like another instance of the extended telepathic action\ndiscussed by Mrs. Sidgwick in Proc. Vol. XXXIII., pp. 330-1,\nwhere agent and percipient are unknown to each other but\napparently linked by a person known to both. For the matters\ncommunicated maniEestly suggest the mental unity of the living\nsister-in-law, \" Annie,\" rather than that of the deceased brother :\nthey were all things which had recently been in her thoughts.\nThe communication, as in the case, through Mrs. Brittain,\nwhich I reported in the Jourml for November 1923, took a\nspiritualistic form. That appears to be inevitable whenever\n\" mediumship \" has been attributed to a percipient. Telepathy,\nindeed, as Mrs. Sidgwick, I think has said, while it makes survival\nmore probable, makes it more difficult to prove.\nHubert Wales.\nIII. Subliminal Idiosyncrasies.\nTo the Editor oj the Journal of the S.P.R.\nMadam,\u2014In the letter from E. S. Thomas, in the May Journal,\np. 76, the recollection of a rose form is described as accompanied\nby the turning of the eyes\n'\n' upwards and over towards the\nback of [the] head.\" Mrs. A. L. Sinclair, replying to my enquiry\nabout her own clairvoyance, writes, April 18, 1925 :\n\" My '\nseeing '\nwhen my eyes are open and I am quite conscious may\n\f128 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Oct., 1925\ninterest you, as I do not see things before me but seem to be\nlooking into the back of my head and see the pictures as on a\nblack curtain.\" I find it of interest to place these and similar\nstatements beside one which occurs in the Journal of the American\nS.P.R., vol. X., p. 644, in a \" Digest of Spirit Teachings \" received\nthrough Mrs. M. E. Keeler and edited by Prescott F. Hall. In\nthis it said that the astral body \" is not organised, except the\neyes, which are situated back of the physical eyes and are not\nusually open,\" and further on (p. 682) adds ''\nmay even face\nbackwards as compared with the physical eyes.\" Dr. Alrutz also\nquotes in Proceedings xxxiv, p. 171, Mrs. Piper's remark about\nhaving \"two distinct pairs of eyes,\" and that she used the one\njmir behind the other. F. E. Leaning.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nFasc I-II, 1925, of the Archivio Generate di Neurologia, Psichiatrie\nPsicoanalisi, has an article by Professor Bianchini on sexual symbolism\nin the mystic dream with special reference to ecstasy which\ncontains a bibliography of some interest.\nPsyche for April has a criticism on the recent experiments in\nthought transference with Prof. Gilbert Murray, in which the\nwriter insists on the necessity for control conditions before\naccepting the phenomena as supernormal. Dr. F. G. Crookshank\nhas an interesting paper on the psychological interest in general\nmedical j^ractice, while Dr. William Brown discusses the relations\nbetween religion and psychology.\nPsychische Studien for June has an important paper by Mr. Lud-\nwig Szczepanski of Cracow, dealing with the medium Guzik.\nSittings had been held with members of the Metapsychical Society\nof Cracow and the results were disappointing. Flashlight photo-\ngraphs had been taken and it was discovered that Guzik had\nfreed one hand from the control and was using it to manipulate\nobjects. The exposure adds to the already considerable mass\nof evidence against the reality of Guzik's phenomena, but even\nthe Cracow investigators are still convinced that he has some\ngenuine mediumistic power since they say that \" during the\nseances in Cracow we observed telekinetic phenomena which we\nare unable to explain by trickery.\"\n\fNOTICES.\nMEETING or THE COUNCIL.\nA Meeting of the Council will be held at 31 Tavistock Square, Loudon,\nW.C. 1, on Tuesday, November lOtU, 1925.\nPEIVATE MEETING OF THE SOCIETY.\nA Private Meeting of the Society will be held at the British Medical\nAssociation House, Tavistock Square, London, W.C. 1, in the Hastings\nHall, on Tuesday, November 10th, 1925, at 5 p.m., when a paper entitled\n\" Some Recent Evidence bearing on the Question of Survival \" Avill be I'ead\nby Sir Oliver Lodge, F.R.S.\nNOTICE TO MEMBERS OF THE jSOCIETY RESIDING IN\nCANADA AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\nMembers and Associates living in America are requested to pay their\nsubscriptions, as they become due, to the Society's Agent, the F.

Not only did \" Mrs. Lowther \" vohmteer only\none name and not, as Mr. Swafier states two, but Mr. Swafier\nlearnt the names of these purporting communicators in what should\nhave been the confidence of a seance, and after the seance when\nhe asked Miss Radclyffe-Hall and myself whether he might publish\nthem we most emphatically said NO, explaining that until we\ngave permission they must be kept private, as their publication\nmight cause great pain and annoyance to surviving relations.\nI regret that Mr. Swaffer, by associating my name and Miss\nRadclyffe-Hall's with an entirely incorrect account of what occurred\nat the sittings we attended, has made it necessary that I should\nsend a clear contradiction of his erroneous impressions for publi-\ncation in the official organ of the S.P.R. and if necessary else-\nwhere. If he cannot report accurately, at least where we are\nconcerned, and presumably trusts to an unreliable memory, it\nwould be better that he should hold his peace.\nI am still more sorry that he broke a pledge of discretion freely\ngiven by him to us both, and exacted with a view to sparing\npain to the bereaved.\nI must beg that you will not allow any further liberties to be\ntaken with our names in your columns. We are serious investi-\ngators of many years standing\u2014not emotional or credulous novices,\nand we cannot have our position assailed by association with the\npublication of inaccuracies or imaginary incidents.\nYours trulv,\nUna V. Troubridge.\nReply from Mr. J. W. Potter.\nOct. nth, 192-5.\nUna, Lady Troubridge,\n37 Holland Street,\nKensington, W.\nMadam,\u2014I am in receipt of your letter of 12th inst. I regret\nthe letter, for the reason that it proves up to the hilt the exist-\nence of the very features Mr. Hannen Swaffer very rightlv and\nfairly contends against, namely, the triviality of mind of those\nwho participate in some of these \" test \" sittings ; and secondly,\nit is a very patent illustration of the very thing he deplores in\n\f132 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1925\na Society of eminence and standing, namely, the unfortunate\npractice of straining after a gnat and swallowing a camel.\nThe points on which you base your criticism of Mr. Swaffer are\nvery trivial. The utmost that can be said is that in the dark-\nness he may possibly have mistaken the objective of the spirit-\nvoice. To say that \" the incident never occurred \" is to ask me\nto believe that a falsehood has been manufactured. I am not\nprepared to accept that assertion, particularly in face of certain\nrecords which have been produced to me.\nHowever, I can quite understand how eager you must be to\ndesire to put a brighter face upon those sittings than Mr. Swafier\nfelt himself able to do. And for that same reason I can under-\nstand your desire to withhold your names as attestees of such\nsittings ; but I understand you were representing a Society of\nsome public standing, and anonymity does not comport very well\nwith its actions ; and I utterly fail to see how he could break a\npledge of discretion by using his discretion. No complaint was\nmade as to your personal seriousness, and I have little sympathy\nwith investigators who wish to remain anonymous, even if the\nfacts as recorded and published are not to their liking. However,\nwe have no desire to mention the names referred to in our\nJournal^ and they would not have been mentioned had they not\nbeen active participators in the sittings referred to\u2014the results of\nwhich were for publication, and could not have been of the\nprivate character you suggest.\nYours faithfully,\nJ. W. Potter.\nIt will be observed that Mr. Potter entirely avoids the point\nof Lady Troubridge's letter, which -was that after Mr. Swafier\nhad asked whether he might print the names of two pur-\nporting communicators, and this request had been most\nemphatically refused, Mr. Swaffer has nevertheless published\nthem, an unpardonable breach of confidence. There was no\nattempt at the sittings to conceal Lady Troubridge's or Miss\nEadclyfte-Hairs identity, and Mr. Potter's talk about their\nwishing to remain anonymous is simply an attempt to confuse\nthe issues.\nTo this we may add (1) Mr. Swaffer was not, as he states,\npermitted to attend the sittings at Tavistock Square \" as\n\fNov., 1925 The Christian Sjnritualist and the S.P.R. 133\nrepresenting the Press.'' The Society does not invite journalists,\nas such, to attend its investigations. Mr. Swafier came as a\nfriend of Mr. Bradley, and as a guest of the Society. His\nattack on the Society, quite apart from any question of in-\naccuracy, is a flagrant breach of the ordinary rules of courtesy.\n(2) Mr. Swaffer mentions \" a big wire cage, in which, I\nunderstood, Valiantine might have been asked to sit, later\non, if the sittings continued.\" Valiantine was not being\ntested by the S.P.R. for physical phenomena, but solely for\nmental phenomena ; no suggestion was ever made as to the\nemployment of any of the forms of control used in physical\ninvestigations. The cage in question, as Dr. WooUey clearly\nexplained, was intended to hold, not any medium at all, but\narticles which another medium, who was cj^uite used to this\nprocedure, was to attempt to levitate. Our seance room is\nentirely devoid of any \" contraptions designed to \" grab\n\"\neither mediums or journalists.\n(3)\n\" Mediums do not like the S.P.R. or their methods.\"\nThis is a stale untruth. Bona-iide mediums acknowledge the\nS.P.R. to be their best friend, as Mr. Swaffer can readily\nascertain by asldng either Mrs. Piper or Mrs. Leonard.\n(4)\n\" If the Bradleys and I had not been present at the\nS.P.R. sittings in Tavistock Square, the story would have\nspread that because he had failed to reproduce there the\nphenomena we got in Bradley's house, Valiantine was a fraud.\"\nIt is difficult to see how any medium could be accused of\nfraud as a result of negative sittings, and still more difficult to\nunderstand how the presence of ]\\Ir. Swaffer and Mr. and Mrs.\nBradley could help to refute that charge if anyone were foolish\nenough to make it.\nCONCERNING THE FORMATION OF A GROUP.\nMr. Tretheivy asks us to publish in the Journal, in continuation\nof his letter in the July Number, p. 109, the following circular letter\nwhich he has addressed to certain Members and Associates of the\nSociety to invite them to join the group for literary research. He\nrequests any Member or Associate who requires further information\nand has not already communicated with him, nor received a copy\n\f134 Jonmal of Society for Psycldcal Research Nov., 1925\nof this letter, to consider this copy as addressed to himself and\nreply to it.\n\u2014Editor.\nFrom Artillery Mansions,\nA. W. Trethewy. Victoria Street,\nLondon, S.W. 1.\nTelephone : Franklin, 6145. October, 1925.\nDear Sir or Madam,\u2014When reading Sir J. G. Frazer's Gifiord\nLectures on Immortality and the Worship of the Dead, I was dis-\nappointed with his attitude towards psychic questions. He seems to\nknow little of modern psychical research, and, whenever he touches\non phenomena purporting to be spirituahstic, to speak in an apolo-\ngetic tone for wasting the time of his audience in discussing what\nhe regards as fraudulent fabrications. Any person going over the\nsame ground with an open mind and an adequate knowledge of\npsychical research would bring into prominence points which he\nhas omitted or kept in the background. There seems to be ample\nscope for starting a comprehensive survey of the whole field on\nsuch lines. As some classes of phenomena which are familiar to\nus in the West seem to occur frequently among other races, it is\nreasonable to presume that there as here the genuine and the\nfraudulent are intermingled. But even if the alleged phenomena\nare of a type strange to us, the reports should not be discredited\non a priori grounds without due consideration of the evidence.\n(2) The first step in any systematic enquiry must be the col-\nlection of relevant material. When sufficient progress has been\nmade in this process, the uses to which the information can be\nput will present themselves more clearly than can be seen at the\nmoment. We are at any rate justified in hoping that comparison\nof both methods and residts between divers races East and West\nmay throw light on the true nature of such phenomena as trance\nspeaking, \" materiahsation,\" and \" the direct voice.\" In China\nand Japan the \" controls \" of trance speakers seem similar to\nthose of Western mediums, for instance, Mrs. Piper. Plutarch,\nwith reference to the Oracle at Delphi, forestalled the speculations\nof to-day concerning the source of a medium's \" inspiration \" and\nthe influence of the minds of the medium and the sitter on the\nform of the message. It will be interesting to compare the\n\" spirit teachings \" of Europe and America with those of other\nparts of the world, especially China, Japan, and the South Seas.\n\fNov., 1925 Concerning the Formation of a Group 135\nThere is pretty good evidence of \" direct voice \" seances among\ntlie Maoris of New Zealand ; there are extraordinary stories about\n\" materialisations \" among the same race and among the Chinese.\n(3) By the Maoris the spirits of infants are reputed to be the\nmost dangerous and cruel of all, because they have never under-\ngone the trials of existence and have had no experience of the\npains which they inflict. This is an instance of the kind of\nbelief which, though it appears fantastic to us, should not be\ndismissed olf-hand as due merely to a priori speculation. Search\nshould be made for some basis of psychical experience, which from\nthe Maori point of view has been interpreted as supporting this\ntheory. Such investigations may increase our knowledge of psy-\nchical problems while throwing a different light on the phenomena\nin question.\n(4) The field is too vast for any single researcher to attempt to\ncover. The only way to begin to deal with it is to form a group\nand to get each member or set of members to choose a country,\nor period, or other sub-division of the subject. A great deal of\nliterary research will be required even if it is restricted to psychical\npractices without being extended to follc-lore and religious beliefs.\nNo doubt it is difficult to draw the line between these subjects\nbecause in many instances traditions and opinions may have origi-\nnated from \" spirit teachings.\" Information about the psychical\npractices observable in the present day will also be highly desirable,\nand may perhaps be obtained through members of the Society\nresident abroad. Attempts may also be made through the Press\nand otherwise to get into touch with foreign correspondents.\n(5) It will be expedient, as a preparatory part of the scheme,\nto ascertain under expert guidance how much work suitable for\nthe purpose has already been done by Anthropological Societies,\nAntiquaries and Researchers of various kinds.\n(6) The late Sir William Barrett thought that the working section\nof the Society should be increased, and he urged the establishment\nof a group to gather together members wdth a sufiiciently wide field\nto give scope to each for the study which appealed to him indi-\nvidually. I am doing my best to carry out his ideas, and am\nready to take my share of the work, but shall be glad to leave\nthe superintendence and direction of the researches to other mem-\nbers more competent than myself.\nWill you join us, or at any rate attend a meeting, at the S.P.R.\n\f136 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Nov., 1925\nLibrary, on Wednesday, December 2nd, at 3 p.m., to discuss the\nsubject, and then or afterwards decide whether you will take part\nin the work ? . -\n'\nYours faithfully,\nA. W. Trethewy.\nCASE.\nL. 1272. Book-Tests.\nThe following case came to us originally through Sir Oliver\nLodge, to whom one of the two automatists concerned, here\ncalled Mxs. Williams, is known personally. The other auto-\nmatist, here called Mrs. Kerr, is an Associate of the Society.\nThe names and addresses of both these ladies are known to\nus. The tests have been obtained by the two automatists\nsitting together, using a oiiija board. Both have lost sons in\nthe war, and these two yomig men are the ostensible com-\nmunicators.\nThe sittings at which the tests were obtained took place\nbetween February and June, 1923, and a first account of them\nwas sent to Sir Oliver Lodge in December of that year. Sir\nOliver Lodge sent them on to the Hon. Editor, Mrs. Salter, in\nthe spring of 1924 with a covering letter, dated March 26th,\n1924, in the course of which he says :\nA Mrs. [Williams] my wife and I met in Scotland and got to\nknow well . . . has often received evidential messages. For instance\nwhen she did not know where her son W- was, she was told\nsui^ernormally, that he was in the East, and would return some\nday from Alexandria\u2014aU which was true. . . .\nIn December 1923 she told me of some book-tests received by\na friend of hers, a Mrs. [Kerr]. I asked Mrs. [Kerr] to make a\nrecord ; and I enclose those letters also. . . .\nOliver Lodge.\nSubsequently Mrs. Salter got into correspondence with Mrs.\nKerr, and put various questions to her in regard to points that\ndid not seem clear in the account sent to Sir Oliver Lodge,\nincluding questions concerning the date and place at which the\nsittings occurred. Answers to these enquiries were received\nfrom Mrs. Kerr in letters dated Jvdy 18th and July 24th, 1925.\n\fNov., 1925 Case 137\nWe print below the report sent to Sir Oliver Lodge, incor-\nporating in it the additional information received in July, 1925.\nThis additional information consists in a statement as to the\ndate and place of the sittings (the actual addresses are not\nprinted here), and an amplification of the report on Test 1,\nmaking clear a point which seemed obscure in the original\nstatement. The final report, as printed, is corroborated by the\nother automatist, Mrs. Williains.\nStatement by Mrs. KERR.\n[Mrs. Kerr alludes first to some earlier experiences, similar\nto those described below, of which a report appeared in Light.\nShe then continues :]\nSince then, another friend, Mrs. [Williams], and I have sat to-\ngether at each other's houses, with gradually improving results.\nOn February 1st [1923] we got our first book-test. I may say\nhere that the tests are not simply proofs that minds not our own\nare writing through us, but they have each an inner poignant\nmeaning for us which it is difficult to write down in words.\nI quote from notes made with one hand while the other is laid\nlightly beside Mrs. [Williams] on the traveller. The communicators\nare chiefly our two sons.\nTest No. 1.\nFeb. 1st, 1923, at Mrs. Williams's house, Edinburgh. \" Look in\nour study.\" (Do you mean the smoking-room ?)\n\" No, study.\"\n(Whose study?) \"I 's room.\" (This word Mrs. [Williams] con-\nsiders was a good test in itself. The room referred to as \" the\nstudy \" was her son I 's bedroom. This room Mrs. [Williams]\nhad been in before her son's return from his Tutor's ; it was then\nan ordinarily furnished bedroom. She was aware that he now\nretired to this room to read up for an exam., but as it happens,\nshe had not been in the room until she went to fetch the book\nindicated below. She then found, to her great surprise, that he\nhad metamorphosed the room ; had arranged his school-books in\nthe book-case, had hung up dark curtains, and imported a table\nand a reading-lamp ; so that in its present state the room might\nwell be called a study.\" The word \" study \" also, in Mrs\n[Williams's] opinion, had a touch of humour about it, as there\nhad been a family joke about the word.)\n\f138 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Nov., ]925\n\"A book with a letter in it.\" (On a table?) \"No.\" (The\nbook-case ?) Yes. Second shelf, right-hand side, middle book.\nHill mounting\u2014on the page a letter about hill-climbing. Count 7\nto letter. Our test.\"\nNote.\u2014Mrs. {Williams] remarked that this would be a book about\nmotoring, as she knew her son had books on the subject. She\nwent to her son's room and picked out from his newly-arranged\nbook-case what she judged to be the middle, right-hand book on\nsecond sheK. Together we opened it at page 7. The book was\na, manual on precis writing, and on page 7 was a letter in smaller\nprint than the explanatory matter. I quote a part of it :\n\" In sooth, the higher a man is raised in the ladder of\nhonour, the more ought he to be distinguished for his virtues,\nand the higher he cUmb up the steep of virtue, the greater\nshame to him if he fall into the depths of vice.\"\nThe words \" climb \" and \" higher \" come into another sentence\nin the same letter, but it is too long to quote. This metaphorical\nuse of the words made the test an interesting one.\nTest No. 2.\nFebruary 15th, 1923, at Mrs. Williams's house, Edinburgh.\n\" We want to say that you must watch your thoughts always.\nMind is soul. Cannot be spiritual when it harbours unworthy\nthoughts. Look in your prayer-book, on page 7. Be careful.\nWe give a good test. Take very first book out in this room.\nTop shelf\u2014get prayer-book.\"\n(Mrs. [Williams] said, \" But there are no pi^'^yer-books in this\nroom. I am sure of it ! \") \" Look and see.\" Very unwillingly\nMrs. [Williams] took out the first book on right-hand of book-case\n\u2014top shelf. This top row of books was a set of small books,\nuniformly bound in ancient calf. They were really there for their\nneat appearance. Mrs. [Williams] said she had never looked into\nthem. The book indicated was described on the Title-page as\nThe Voice of Devotion, a course of prayer for the private use of\nChristians, dated 1829. On page 7 was the following :\n\"May my understanding be more informed in divine things;\nmy affection more holy and heavenly, my heart more right\nwith God. Till the day dawn and the shadows flee away,\nmay there be an open and unrestrained intercourse between\nThee and my soul.\"\n\fNov., 1925 Case 139\nThis seemed a very beautiful amplification of the thoughts sug-\ngested before the test.\nTest No. 3.\nMarch 23rd, 1923, at Mrs. Kerr's house, Edinburgh. In the\ncourse of this sitting I asked the communicator, a near relation\nof Mrs. [Williams] if she could tell me what my son's chief work\nwas. I had tried to find out about this, but without success.\n\" He is most industrious about getting his special work on.\"\n(What work ?)\n\" Must leave that for him to tell, he will tell you\nsoon.\"\nAt the beginning of the sitting there had come from my son,\n\" Take out my prayer-book, page 4\u2014my own writing is on the\npage, a separate page.\" Then followed messages for my friend\nfrom her relatives. Late in the sitting I asked\u2014(What about the\nprayer-book test ?) \"On the table upstairs in your room\u2014page\n14 or 4.\"\nThe only \" prayer-book \" on the table in my room was Miss\nDallas' Communion and Fellowship. The words, my own writing\nis on a page, a separate page,\" applied, I found, to a book lying\non top of Miss Dallas'. It is curious that there should have been\nthis confusion, when the book below it was obviously meant. On\nexamining Miss Dallas' book we found that the page called 14 is\nalso page 4, eleven pages being taken up with introductory matter.\nWhat is called Part I. begins on page 11, so page 14 or 4 de-\nscribes this page correctly.\nThe prayer on this page seemed to us to furnish an answer to\nour question as to my son's special work. I quote part of it :\n\" Whatsoever work Thou hast for him to do in his present\nsphere give him the will and the grace to do it with increas-\ning love and power. ... If it be in accordance with Thy\ndivine purpose that he should still sliare in the work on earth,\nmay those to whom he is permitted to draw near, be open\nto receive the help which he can give. . .\n.\"\nI have underlined the words which were specially applicable.\nTest No. 4.\nJune 11th, 1923, at Mrs. Kerr's house, Edinburgh. We have\noften noticed that the book-tests seemed to be answers to what\nmy friend and I had been discussing before we took up the board.\nOn 11th June we had been speaking in rather a depressed\n\f140 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Nov., 1925-\nmanner of how difficult life was. I think the weather had been\nhot and tiring. After a personal veridical message this came :\n\" Now we see a very curious thing in our dining-room\u2014in a\npress\u2014on second shelf from top\u2014a little piece of paper in which\nis written a message.\" (Which book counting from right hand ?)\n\" Book 3, 1st page. That is all. Look !\n\" (What is on the\npage?) \"A curious sentence suitable to you both.\"\nIn the dining-room books are kept in a book-case with glass\ndoors, and also in an oak dresser. I looked first in the book-\ncase : the 3rd book on second shelf was Life of Naismith. There\nwas no writing in it ; and there was no piece of paper in it>\nI then glanced at the dresser and saw that Blake's poems was\nthe third book on second sheU, but I did not take it out\u2014I felt\nsure there could be nothing special in it. So we concluded that\nthe test had failed somehow. Later in the afternoon Mrs. [Williams]\nsaid she would like to examine Blake's poems for herself, and to\nmy intense surprise she found I had written on the fly-leaf,\nprobably at the time of Lord Kitchener's death, the following :\n\" Kitchener's Last Message.\"\n\" We have to stick it out and do our very best until the\nrelease comes. I only wish I could do more, or rather, that\nwhat I do was better work.\" (Extract from a letter to Lord\nDesborough.)\nNote that the word \" message \" was mentioned in the directions\nbefore the position of the book was given.\nPicture-postcard Test.\nFebruary 8th, 1923,^ at Mrs. Kerr's house, Edinburgh. This last\ntest is rather different as it concerns a postcard instead of a book.\nThe point of the test lies in the fact that about ten days-\npreviously I had been visiting CraigmiUar Castle, near Edinburgh,\nwith one of my children, and I said it reminded me of Tattershall\nCastle in Lincolnshire, which I had visited with the son who now\ngives us the \"Tests.\" The point of the \"test\" to my thinking\nis, that my son wished to let me know he had heard our conver-\nsation and had been interested in it.\n\" We have another test now. Go to R\u2014\u2014's room and look in\nour post-card book. Be careful. It is on the shelf.

No one lives\nthere. . .\n.\" (What else is on the page 1) \"A picture of animals.\nYou took me specially to see the wonderful courtyard.\" (Were we\nalone ?) \" Just us two.\"\nOn one of two shelves in a cupboard in the room indicated we\nfound a pre-war family post-card album.\nAfter examining carefully the 74 pages with two cards on each\npage, we found that one card alone fulfilled all the specified con-\nditions. It is a picture of Tattershall's Castle, Lincolnshire. I\nwas not aware that we had a card of it.\n(1) It is a high castle and looks very high on the card.\n(2) It rises out of trees.\n(3) No one has lived there for many years.\n(4) The communicator and I were there alone when he was a\nsmall boy. We have never been there since.\n(5) There are 8 cattle in the other card on the same page.\nOnly 5 other cards in the album depict animals, and on the pages\nwith them, the second card is a landscape either with or without\ncottages.\n(6) It is the only castle in the book which the communicator\n.and I visited alone.\nMrs. Kerr enclosed with her report a copy of the picture\npost-card found in the album. It represents Tattershall Castle\nseen surrounded by trees.\nThe point which did not seem quite clear in Mrs. Kerr's\noriginal statement concerning Test 1 was that Mrs. Williams\nhad never been into her son\"s room since he altered the\narrangement of it, until she Avent in to verify the test. Mrs.\nSalter accordingly wrote both to Mi's. Kerr and Mrs. Williams,\nasking for a more exact statement on this point. The infor-\nmation received from Mrs. Kerr is contained in the report\nprinted above ; Mrs. Williams's corroboration -was contained in\na letter to Mrs. Salter, as follow^s :\n\u2022\nJuly, 192.5.\nBook-Tests.\nI delayed replying to your letter regarding the book-tests which\nMrs. [Kerr'\\ and I got together, as I have been trying to find the\nPrecis book to send you\n\u2014\nhwl without success. It is in my\n\f142 Journal of Society for Psycldcal Research Nov., 192\nEdinburgh house, I think, and when we return there in November\nI shall have another hunt for it.\n(1) The name of the book is Hoiv to Memorise, Expand and\nRecast Extracts in Prose and Verse. Unfortunately I cannot re-\nmember the author.\n(2) I had not been into my boy's room since he had altered\nits appearance with the assistance of his twin brother. They\nmade the alterations just before his brother D returned to\nschool and I was left at home to work at some subjects and\nto attend classes. Mrs. [Kerr] and I had our sitting at about\n3.30 p.m. After it I Avent to my boy (I 's) bedroom to find\nthe book indicated. I was out of his room, and as I went\nto the shelves to look for the books I noticed he had changed the\narrangement of the furniture and had put up some heavy dark\ngreen rep curtains and hung some pictures, but I was not struck\nwith the fact that it resembled a study. I thought the com-\nmunicator was being a little playful. I did not examine the book\nuntil I returned to Mrs. [Kerr]. It was not until the next morn-\ning at about ten o'clock, when I went to my boy I 's room\nto speak to him, that I fully recognised the significance of the\nword \" study.\" Although the sun was shining brightly he had the\nblinds and curtains drawn\u2014a small reading lamp (which he had\ntaken from another room) on which he had put a dark green\nshade, stood on the table at which he was seated, and inkpots,\nblotters and papers made the room look hke a scene of a \" study\non the stage.\nWhen Mrs. [Kerr] sent me her notes to read I remember telling\nher that I thought she had not emphasised the fact that I had\nno idea of this change made in I 's room, and did not take\nin the significance of it until next morning.\nMy twin boys, I and D , were at the motor bicycle age,-\nand all the literature they bought was on that subject. So when\nI was told that the page indicated was on \" hill climbing \" I\ninstantly imagined that it would be a motoring magazine that I\nwould find on the shelf. I remember a distinct feeling of failure\nas I descended the stairs with the Precis book. . . .\nS. C. [WILLIAMS].\nThis case may be compared with the book-tests obtained by\nMr. J. F. C.

Louis\nFavre, the professor of experimental method in the Faculty of\nPsychology. The article is entitled La MetajJsijcMqne et la methode-\n\f144 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Nov., 1925\nscientifique and is a plea for the serious and unprejudiced study\nof alleged supernormal phenomena. The author takes his stand\nby those who adhere rigidly to the scientific method and exposes\nthe hollow pretensions of those whose interest in psychical\nresearch is based on curiosity or emotion. He recognises the\npresent position of the subject and suggests a form of notation\nwhich can be applied to opinions expressed as to the value of\ncertain facts. The scheme is worth consideration, although it\nappears that the percentages expressed would only be of value\nif the reader could first assure himself of the capability of the\nobserving parties who employed the suggested notation.\nThe Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research for\nJuly has a reply by Dr. Crandon to the recent paper by Prof.\nM'Dougall on the \" Margery \" case and a brief article by the\nlate Dr. Hyslop on certain subjective sensations associated with\ntrance phenomena.\nThe issue for August has an account by Mr. Harry Price (who\nhas now joined the staff of the reorganized American Society)\nof some sittings with the medium Willy Schneider in Vienna :\nthe record is fairly full although the control of the circle is not\nfully described, neither is it stated how the left hand of Mrs.\nHolub and the right hand of Professor Thirring were controlled.\nThe phenomena were similar to those which occurred in London,\nbut the distances at which objects were moved were greater than\nanything that had been noted in England. Mr. Price describes\nthe phenomena as \" convincing,\" and although some inquirers\nmight not care to commit themselves to this extent, it appears\nto be difficult to suggest any theory which does not involve one\nor other of the sitters as confederates, a supposition which will\nhave to be met and answered in all cases of alleged physical\nmediumship.\nThe Value of Studies in Psychical Research.

Further particulars will be announced later.\nHYPNAGOGIC PHENOMENA.\nSince the pubhcation of Part XCIV. of our Proceedings dealing\nwith this subject, various accounts have been received from\nmembers, of which a selection, partly in abstract, is given\nbelow. To them are added the case of an attested veridical\nvision by a lady, Mrs. Harry (pseudonym), personally known\nto Mrs. Leaning, and who is the correspondent qiioted on\npp. 335, 350, 367, 386, etc., of the paper referred to. This\n\fDec, 1925 Hypnagogic Phenomena 147\nis followed by some additional remarks by the writer on the\nsubject.\nVarious Hypnagogic Experiences.\nI. From Miss M. Cunnington.\n\" From a child I have '\nseen things ' just before sleeping.\nFirst I had a sensation of rapid movement, then forms appear,\nbrilliantly coloured and lit up. It is as though the sun illumined\nand gave brilliance to the moving forms. These are usually\nbeautiful, leaping and running figures in gardens full of flowers.\nOn those days when I have been to town, I see moving throngs ;\nafter cychng I see the hedgerows slipping past on either side,\nwhile I seem to be darting like a swallow down and up without\neffort.\"\nII. Fro7n Miss Alice Woods.\n\" As a child I had these visions constantly, usually of human\nbeings. One of a httle organ boy came again and again, so that\nI made up stories about him to myself. His figure occupied the\nwhole field of vision and came just before sleep. I cannot\nremember any movement in connection with these visions and in\nadult life there has been Little sense of motion. At present I\nsee landscapes which cover the whole field, but do not move.\nThey appear somewhat suddenly or form themselves from some\nslight mistiness on the field of vision. They are always very\nbeautiful, but sometimes are in brown siena and not coloured.\nWhat is much more usual is to see a most beautiful face of child,\nwoman, or man like a tiny miniature in the middle of the field.\nThese usually just fade away, but occasionally they change into\na grotesque or ugly face. Some years ago I used to see most\nlovely colours, especially a most radiant blue, but I have only\nhad a very rare treat of the blueness since I was about 60 yrs.\nof age.\"\n' III. From Mrs. Ernest Thesiger.\nBetween the ages of 4 and 7 \"'I used to see '\ngrotesques,'\nhorrid httle figures with leering faces and mdeterminate outlines.\"\nFrom time to time another vision \" was of a round whirling thine,\nagain of ill-defined shape, but with a sort of face, which appeared\nat the cornice of the room at the corner furthest from my bed,\nand rolled towards me : when it reached the middle point of the\nceiling, it vanished there, reappearing simultaneously in the corner\n\f148 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Dec, 1925\nagain. It went very fast and always vanished at the centre.\nThe last time was before I was twelve.\" After-images, such as\nworms after a day's hoeing, sweet-peas, after cutting many hours,\nhave occurred, though \" I am a very bad visualiser.\"\nIV. From Mr. H. F. Saltmarsh.\n\" I have visual hypnagogic illusions with great constancy. . . .\nBut in addition to the ordinary phenomena it happens sometimes\nwhen I am getting drowsy a sentence or phrase keeps coming\ninto my mind. It is usually completely nonsensical ; I have\nnot consciously taken any part in forming it, nor have I any\ncontrol over it, it comes and goes apparently from some extra-\nneous source. There is no pseudo-auditory or other sensory\naccompaniment. I am, as in other hypnagogic states, sufficiently\nconscious to criticise and be interested in it. . . . This is what I\ncall the pure phenomenon, but I have also experienced it, though\nless frequently, mixed up with the visual type. In these instances\nI have a hypnagogic vision of a printed book which I try to read.\nI never succeed in getting more than about half a line, and it is\nalways the same sort of nonsense. I have never been able to\nremember any of the sentences except on two occasions when I\nspoke them aloud in the hearing of my wife. The first case\nwas accompanied by a vision of people walking up and down a\nroad which I recognised. I said '\nthere are multi-millionaires\nand psychical entities walking about.' The second case is hypno-\npompic and is of the pure type. I said aloud '\nWhat's the\nsquadron ? '\nWhat I wanted to say was '\nWhat's the time ?\n'\nIf I am right in considering these phenomena as being of the\nsame nature as the more common hypnagogic visions, I think\nthey throw some light on the theory of origin. It is a plausible\ntheory that the visual type arise from entoptic phenomena, and\nthe auditory from similar entauric sensations, but in the case of\nthe sentences unaccompanied by any pseudo-sensations a peripheral\norigin seems to be out of the question.\"\nMr. Saltmarsh further asks whether the data show any connection\nbetween visualizing power and power of control. As the per-\ncentages shown do not apply to the same individuals in the two\ngroups respectively, nothing can be based on a comparison of\nthem. The contradictory results given by those cases where\nthere is sufficient information, points, however, to there being no\nnecessary connection involved.\u2014F. E. L.\n\fDec, 1925 Hypnagogic Phenomena 149\nV. From Mr. E. S. TJiotnas.\n\" With regard to the mental moving pictures, I am led to\nwonder whether the never-ceasing cinematograph is not possibly\ndue to a slight derangement of the optical nerve-roots or brain\nareas relative thereto. One can see no use for the everworking\ncinematograph or regression of visual images. For the never-\nceasing stream of thought or memory there is a utilitarian object,\n\u2014the adjustment of past experiences to present needs.\nI have been struck in my own hypnagogic experiences by visual\nimagery of landscapes in which moving objects occur. ... I had\nmany before the war. At times just before sleep I could conjure up\nthe visual perception of anything I liked ;\ne.g. faces of friends with\nmost amusing distinctness and naturalness of detail. At other times\n[ I have, and had never been, a good visualiser. Hypnagogic\nfaces I often see of the kind described by Myers, grotesque and\nhideous faces growing larger, moulded out of the dark purply\nbackground of the '\nscreen.' [They] are indescribably horrible at\ntimes, leering and evil, with raw gaping mouths. Yet they are\nnot terrifying ;\nthey only fill me with amazement and they do\nnot affect my dreams.\" (Letter of May 1923.)\n\" I am a generally healthy person, seldom seriously ill, but tend\nto be easily depressed. I am short-sighted but have had no\noptical hallucinations which could be attributed to eyesight. I\nfeel myself that the hypnagogic phenomena have no connection\nwith eyesight, or experience, or generally with one's artistic or\naesthetic proclivities in the form they take. [The faces] at first\nare only faintly visible : then they come forward and become\nbetter '\nlit,' crowding round or passing away to my right. They\nare either long or puffy as a rule, the latter as though made of\ncotton wool or dough. I think the two forms keep distinct, the\nlong type elongating and dropping to pieces like a viscid material,\nthe other breaking away more or less laterally ... I have no\ncontrol over them except to dismiss them at will, if I think of\nit, which is equivalent to returning to full consciousness. I\nshould class separately exceedingly distinct and minutely accurate\nvisions of friends and relatives which I am able very occasionally\nto summon at will. There is not the same '\npsychic tone\n'\naccompanying them as the others. There is in the latter case a\ntone feeling difficult to describe : utter solid silence : a kind of\nrelaxed numbness.\n\f150 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Dec, 1925\nI too have experienced the bright sunlight landscapes, but less\nfrequently : usually a white road in an avenue of trees, every\ndetail\u2014-leaves, trunk, cart-ruts, pebbles\u2014microscopically clear. I\nhave seen a little figure running down the road, bobbing as he\n\u20acomes : I observed him with reference to the trees, and he really\n'\nmoved.'\nA year ago after a successful effort to compose a mediaevaUy\nconceived illamination to an old carol, I had a remarkable hyp-\nnagogic vision of a hyper-mediaeval, hypergothic type : positively\ncelestial, blue white and gold, angels and kings in sumptuously\nembroidered garments, with collars like Richard II. in the West-\nminster altar embroidery, gothic tracery galore, musical instruments,\ngracious smiling faces : I remember the general setting well. Then\ncame a glorious statue of a queen, with long plaits, in a curious\nhigh crown with a wonderful type of face something like the\nearly Greek type . . . She opened her eyes and gradually glowed\nwith living hues . . . Latterly after seeing some pre-Raphaelite\npictures which delighted me very much, I had gorgeous colour-\nexperiences. Endless carpets were unrolled, changing rapidly.\nThey had carpet patterns, but the colours glowed like sunlit\nstained glass, producing . . . rich and majestic effects. The whole\neffect . . . was of splendour and graciousness, and glory, and\nrarity.\" (Letter of June 5th, 1925.)\nIn reply to questions Mr. Thomas wrote (June 12th, 1925) :\nI have never seen tiny figures ... At what age I started seeing\nI cannot say. I feel that I saw them as a small child very dim\nand misty, and that I also have seen them as a child vaguely\nfearfully, with my eyes open and very large. (It comes back as\nI write). I saw the Devil under a bush in the kitchen garden when\nabout 6 in Ceylon. (My childhood, through native servants, was\noccupied with much \" devil \" thought !). At night I used, occa-\nsionally, to hear music, generally of an intensely sad nature.\"\nVI. From Prof. Romaine Newbold.\nWhen about 8 years old, just falling asleep, I felt something\nsoft and warm press against the back of my neck for a moment\nand then withdraw. I thought it was the cat, but in a moment\nrealised a cat could not thus withdraw without giving more\ndefinite evidence of her presence : then I shrieked in terror and\nmy parents had much trouble in pacifying me ... I have had no\n\fDec, 1925 Hypnagogic Phenomena 151\nother hallucination of touch, but can explain the above, which I\nrecall vividly, in no other way.\nIn 1881, when I was 15J yrs. of age, I spent a week or so\ncamping on the south shore of Long Island . . . gunning for snipe\nand plover. While falling asleep I would see vivid pictures,\nnow of the reedy bay shore, now of the sandy ocean beach, with\nor without the birds I was seeking. I have never had any visua-\nlizing power, and these brilliantly colored pictures gave me my\nfirst comprehension of what I had lost by not having it.\nThe first hypnagogic visions since then I can date from my\nrecovery from influenza in 1889. For days I was tormented at\nnight with horrible faces and the like. But as I do not recall\niDeing alarmed, I presume the experience was not wholly novel.\nIf I am delayed in falling asleep I very frequently begin to\n^'\nsee things.\" These belong to definite classes, and the classes are,\nI think, never intermingled.\n(^4) Faces, with or without figures. Of two kinds :\n(a) Ugly, often, with grotesquely compounded bodies. These I\nsee only when in bad health, especially when suffering from indi-\ngestion. I am quite certain that the devils portrayed in middle age\nsculpture and painting had their origin in the bad food and con-\nsequent chronic indigestion of the workers. At all events I have\nfrequently seen troops of precisely similar devils.\n(6) Ordinary people such as one sees on the street. Always\nseen singly, in semi-darkness, motionless, in gentle melancholy,\nlike the grieving relatives on a 4th century Greek grave stele. I\nhave never seen anyone I knew or any face of conspicuous beauty,\nnor have I any voluntary control over what I see. Effort to\nexert it usually causes them to disappear. The figures are always\nclothed. I have never seen a nude or obscene figure. There is\nlittle if any color.\n(5) Visions of natural objects, (a) Most frequent of all, the\nstarry night sky. (6) Very frequently I find myself flying, face\ndownward, about 20 ft. above the ground. It is always night,\nand I am following a road, trees, fences, fields, dimly seen along\nthe roadside (generated by automobile experiences). (c) In a\nwhite fog I see openings and catch glimpses of distant landscapes.\nNone are recognised.\nAll the above are of common types, but the last is of a kind\n'which I think is not common.\n\f152 Journal of Society for Psychical Research dec, 1925\nTwo or three times I have caught glimpses of what I took\nto be the convolutions of my own brain. One experience was so\ncurious that I will give details ... I saw a darkish field or area\nlike the circle cast on the screen by a lantern. In it were a\nnumber, say 7-15, of rounded objects, irregular in shape, like\npebbles or potatoes, irregularly disposed, each glowing with a\nsoft light like that of a glow-worm. The most distinctive feature\nof this vision was its permanence. With this sole exception, all\nI have seen last but a moment ; I cannot hold them long enough\neven to see the details I wish to see. But this was fixed, save\nthat the boundaries of the field expanded or contracted from time\nto time. I contemplated it in curiosity for a long time. Suddenly\nthe lower boundary moved downward bringing into the field a\nnew object. It was something like a starfish, but the arms were\nbut slender threads springing from projections of the central body\nand I only saw half of it something like this [diagram given] -\nBoth the centre and the arms glowed with brilliant light, like\nthat of a full moon, very much brighter than that of the objects\nI first saw. I recognised it instantly as one of the \" giant star-\nshaped cells \" of the nervous system, and inferred that the objects-\nfirst seen were brain cells. A thrill of excitement went through\nme\u2014and instantly all disappeared. I saw darkness only. Long\nI watched for its reappearance, and once did I see the tips of\nthe \"tentacle\" on the left (there were, I think, three \"tentacles\"\nvisible in the upper side), but I saw no more ... I should have\nadded to my list the twitching '\nhead-snaps,' flashes of light,\nsound of explosion before falling asleep, all of which I have\nexperienced frequently.\"\nRemarks by F. E. Leaning.\nAmong the suggestions made to account for hypnagogic visions\nare two purely physical ones : that of Mr. Thomas, that they are\ndue to disturbance of the optic nerve, and that of Prof. Newbold's,\nthat indigestion may have much to do with it ; in both cases\nthis applies especially to the \" grotesques.\" Since Dr. Head's\nenquiry established a connection between a certain kind of hallu-\ncination and visceral disease, this is quite a plausible idea.\nWriters on psycho-analysis, however, who identify dream pheno-\nmena with the hypnagogic, and have given very little attention.\n\fDec, 1925 Hypnagogic Phenomena 153\nto the latter, have an explanation of theriomorphic or animal-\nshaped forms as symbols of a special (moral) conflict.\nMore light on the subject as a whole seems to me to be found\nin Dr. Morton Prince's studies of co-conscious activities than in\nany other direction. These studies are experimental, extended\nover many years, and found to be of practical application by other\npersons. They seem to establish the fact that there may be, as\nHerschel said, a thought, an intelligence, working within our\nown organisation distinct from that of our own personality,\"\n\u2014\nour conscious personality, that is, and working with the general\nmaterial supplied by it, but recombined and elaborated. This is\nnot speculation or hypothesis, but an interpretation very strictly\nbased on facts, which may be examined in the following papers\nby Dr. M. Prince, which I give for the use of those wishing to\nfollow it up, in addition to the less detailed examples in his book\nThe Unconscious\n:\nAn Experimental Study of Visions. Brain, Pt.

E. Leaning.\nOn the 2nd July, 1925, Mrs. Harry (pseudonym) wrote to\nme as follows :\nSince sending my experiences to you I have had within the last\nmonth quite an interesting one : an early morning \" vision,\"\n\f154 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Dec, 1925\nbetween first and second sleep, in a state of passive but aware\nconsciousness, I saw suddenly, all at once, a clear vision of my\nsister, seated quietly at a table, her face in profile, not looking\nat me, and apparently unconscious of me. She moved her head,\nlooking downwards as if in thought. I noted her dress, dark with\na full light pattern all over it. When writing her next I related\nthis and asked if she had such a dress. We have not met for two\nor three years. Her reply stated the description of the dress was\nquite correct and was one I had not seen. I mentioned I saw it as\na very dark navy or black, with a light pattern. It was dark navy.\nAftor a visit to Mrs. Harry, she obtained for me the\noriginal letter to her sister, Mrs. Jach (pseudonym), written\nJune 11th, giving the same account as the above, and Mrs.\nJack's reply, as follows :\nIt's quite right. You got me some hour of abstraction or\nother, (sitting at the table), the frock quite correct, and I enclose\nthe belt for you to see (not worn now) quite an old cotton voile\nI've had some few years now, but you have never seen it. As\nyou \" saw \" me at 5.30 on waking (a.m.) obviously it was the\ndeveloping of the impression that you had received earlier, the\nday before probably.\nIt will be noted that this is a very similar case to that of\nMiss Ida Wild and her sister, reported in the Journal for\nOctober.\nEEVIEWS.\nI.\nThe Mind and its Place in Nature. By C. D. Broad. London :\nKegan Paul, 1925. (International Library of Psychology and\nScientific Method.)\nThis volume is an extended version of the Tarner Lectures,\nrecently given in Cambridge by Dr. Broad. The aim of the\nTarner Benefaction was to found a course of lectures on \" the\nrelation or lack of relation between the various sciences \" and in\nthe present work the author has fully complied with the condi-\ntions of the Benefaction.\nThe book is divided into five sections. The first is devoted to\na consideration of the various alternative theories of life and mind\n\fDec, 1925 Reviews 155\nwhilst the second is concerned with mental knowledge of existents.\nIn the third section Dr. Broad examines with some care the\nvarious theories of the unconscious ; and in the fourth he dis-\ncusses in outline the arguments, both ethical and empirical, for\nhuman survival of bodily death. The fifth section concerns itself\nwith the unity of the mind and the unity of nature, concluding\nwith a few remarks as to the probable future of mental evolution.\nIt is impossible in a few words to discuss or even to indicate\nin broad outline the many remarkable features of this brilliant\nand stimulating book. The author summarises the various argu-\nments for and against such theories as Biological Mechanism and\nSubstantial Vitalism in a lucid and penetrating manner, showing\nhow the theory of Emergent Vitalism may prove more accej^table\nthan Substantial Vitalism, inasmuch as it does not assume the\nexistence of hypothetical entelechies. Moreover Emergent Vitalism\ndoes not require or necessitate (as Biological Mechanism appears\nto do) a Deistic complement, although it is consistent with such\nan idea should there be any valid reason for believing in such a\nBeing as Deism necessarily implies. In this connection Dr. Broad\nhas admirably summed up the arguments from \" design \" with\ntheir natural relation to teleology ;\nconcluding that the theory of\nentelechies has received some favour on account of the teleological\nnature of organisms regarded from at least one point of view\nwhich he clearly expounds. On this basis, the author argues,\nentelechies have a dual nature which would seem scarcely com-\npatible, since on the one hand they may be regarded as very\ninferior minds or inferior parts of minds animating organisms,\nand on the other as really master minds which almost deserve\nthe title of \" gods.\" Although the whole volume is essential to\nthe general student of philosophy, it is above all important to the\npsychical researcher. For in Section D. Dr. Broad has discussed\nthe arguments for human survival, and in doing this he has\nlargely drawn his facts from those so laboriously collected by the\nSociety for Psychical Research. Thus he commences the second\nchapter of this section by presupposing that the work of the\nSociety \" has elicited a mass of facts which may fairly be called\n\" supernormal,\" in the sense that they cannot, if genuine, be\nexplained on the usual assumptions of science and common sense\nabout the nature and powers of the human mind.\" Having\nassumed the genuineness of a great many of these facts, Dr.\n\f156 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Dec, 1925\nBroad proceeds to examine firstly the ethical arguments and\nsecondly the empirical arguments. Belief in survival would seem,\naccording to the author, to be founded upon five reasons. (1) Some\nhave thought that it was immediately obvious or that they had\nreceived a divine revelation which assured them of it. (2) Others\nhave believed it on authority. (3) Some have thought that it\ncould be proved by general metaphysical arguments. (4) Some\nhave thought that it follows from certain ethical premises. And\n(5) some have thought there is special empirical evidence in favour\nof it. Now, of these five reasons the first two can be dismissed,\nwhereas the third and fourth Dr. Broad ignores, since he is of\nopinion that those metaphysical arguments with which he is ac-\nquainted are extremely doubtful either in their a priori part or in\ntheir empirical part or in both. There remain therefore only the\nethical arguments and the empirical arguments. After a discussion\nof the question whether ethical arguments with factual conclusions\ncan be logically valid, Dr. Broad passes to the most plausible\nof those which have been produced in support of the hypothesis\nof survival. For this purpose he examines the article by Professor\nA. E. Taylor, entitled \" The Moral Arguments for Immortality,\" ^\nbut concludes that the author of that pajjer has not produced any\nvalid arguments for human immortality. Such evidence. Dr.\nBroad thinks, is to be sought, not in ethical considerations but\nin the empirical arguments based on the phenomena treated by\npsychical research. Now in discussing the antecedent probabihty\nof human survival as a hypothesis which adequately describes the\nfacts, certain rival hypotheses have to be considered. For instance,\nthere is the theory of a very extended telepathy among the living ;\nthe theory of impersonation which is often connected with another\ntheory which describes the impersonators as \" devils,\" and other\nhypotheses of a similar kind. Dr. Broad admits the extreme\ndifficulty of discussing the intrinsic probabihty of survival and the\nrival hypotheses. But he thinks that the common theory of im-\npersonation (in which I understand him to mean impersonation\nfrom without) can be neglected, especially in its diabolic form,\nwhich he explains very simply as due to a desire to frighten\npeople from dabbling in the occult, and also to that very general\nfeeling of exclusiveness such as that felt in the medical profession\n^Holborn Reviev; April, 1920, XI. (N.S.), [LXII.], 213-234.\n\fDec, 1925 Reviews 157\nand trade unions when quacks and \" blacklegs \" are objects of\ndiscussion.\nApart from these considerations, the world as it appears to us\nin ordinary experience furnishes no trace of support for the belief\nin survival ;\nalthough Dr. Broad admits that the absence of\nevidence cannot be regarded as in any way conclusive as a\nnegative argument. Similarly all arguments based upon the amaz-\ning picture of the world and the apparently haji-hazard manner\nin which many human beings make their appearance thereon, are\nshown by Dr. Broad to be logically fallacious, since they rest\nmainly upon the illegitimate introduction of judgments of value\ninto questions of fact.\nThe scientific arguments against survival centre around epiphe-\nnomenalism ; even though there are other theories concerning the\nrelation between mind and body which would seem less unfavour-\nable to the hypothesis of survival. Having examined these alter-\nnatives, Dr. Broad turns to the abnormal and supernormal\nphenomena. He sees in the cases of supernormal phenomena\nwhich are said to suggest survival rather what he terms persistence\nthan a conscious, continuous and surviving mind existentially\nindependent of its body. For the sake of argument he conceives\nthe mind as a compound of two factors ; the psychic factor and\nthe bodily. Now it might be supposed that the psychic factor\npersists for a time after the dissolution of the bodily factor to\nwhich it was originally united. This persisting psychic factor\nmay then become attached to the organisms of certain persons\n(mediums), and form what Dr. Broad calls a \" mindkin.\" The\npsychic factor alone is no more a mind than the body in the\ngrave is a mind ; it only becomes part of a mind, or a \" mind-\nkin,\" when attached to another organism normally animated by\nits own psychic factor. This theory is developed at some length,\nbut Dr. Broad is willing to admit that if the cross-correspondences\nreally showed the signs of deliberate intention which are claimed\nfor them, then something more than the mere persistence of a\npsychic factor might have to be conceded. He is not, however,\nsatisfied that this claim has been substantiated, and even if it\nwere granted it would not be unplausible to suggest that the\nactive participants in the work were minds incarnate rather than\ndiscarnate. It is true that in this case an ingenious process of\ntelepathic selection has to be assumed, but this selective operation\n\f158 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Deo., 1925\nhas to be assumed in any case, and as requiring less assumption\nthan the hyiDothesis of survival would seem to possess greater\nintrinsic probability.\nHow far Dr. Broad's hypothesis of the psychic factor will\naccount for the existing facts is hard at present to estimate.\nThe conception clearly rests upon the difficulties of any adequate\ndescription of the facts in the terms demanded by epipheno-\nmenahsm or its derivatives. But in what way Dr. Broad would\ndescribe the psychic factor when detached from its own organism\nis a question which is not fully discussed in this book. It is to\nbe hoped that the author will return to it in another volume as\ntolerantly written and as lucidly expounded as the present.\nE. J. D.\nII.\nThe Crisis in Psycliohcjy. By Hans Driesch. Princeton Univer-\nsity Press, Princeton, N.J. ; Oxford University Press, London.\nPp. xvi, 275.\nEven more markedly than the other philosophic sciences. Psy-\nchology still lingers in that preliminary stage of development in\nwhich a science has to experiment with '\nfirst principles,' that is,\nto search for assumptions which will enable it to progress. The\nmore and the more consciously, therefore, it experiments, the more\nlikely is it to hit upon conceptions which will be valuable, and\nso (in a wide sense) '\ntrue.' It is, therefore, a complete technical\njustification of Psychical Research that it is one of the many ways\nof experimenting with psychological principles, and by no means\nthe least promising and the least likely to lead to success in controlling\nthe operations of mind. It is also an excellent reason for wel-\ncoming another such experiment in the interesting little sketch\nof a psychology which Professor Driesch bases on his '\ntheory of\norder.' But a still more cogent reason for welcoming this book\nmay be found in the attitude towards Psychical Research which\nit reveals. The day is no doubt past, when any psychology which\nclaimed to be '\nscientific '\nwould, as a matter of course, ignore the\npsychical phenomena, such as dreams, hypnotism, dissociation of\npersonality, subconsciousness, unconsciousness, co-conscio;isness and\nimmortality, not to mention such horrors as telepathy, clairvoyance\nprophecy and spiritism, in which Psychical Research found the\nproblems for its studies ; but even now they only receive a\ngrudging mention in most academic psychologies, and I do not\n\fDec, 1925 Notes on Periodicals 159\nknow of anything to equal Prof. Driesch's generosity in devoting\nabout one-third of his space to their discussion. It is true that\neven so, to go into these topics fully, his book is not planned\non a sufficiently ample scale ; it arose out of popular lectures\ndelivered at Peking, Tokyo, and Columbia, and cannot go very\ndeep into the topics it selects as worthy of mention. But the\nchange of attitude is very significant of the change that has come\nover the academic world in Germany, and is very encouraging.\nProf. Driesch not only expresses his conviction, based on personal\nexperience, that \" there are parapsychological or '\npsychical '\nfacts\nof various kinds \"\n(p. 230) ; but recognizes their importance, and\njustifies his treatment, because as he rightly points out, in every\nscience the problematic side is more important for its advance-\nment than the side which is well established \" (p. 242). His\ngeneral conclusion about the '\ncrisis ' of psychology is that \" the\nolder psychology . . . had become absolutely alien to mental life\nas it is experienced by natural men. It '\nexplained ' something\nthat did not exist ! But modern psychology tries to explain what\nreally is present. The popular view of mental life is deepened\nby it, but not displaced \"\n(p. 266). Assuredly, if, as is rumoured,\nProf. Driesch will accept election as the next President of the\nS.P.Pt., we shall have every reason to look forward to a Presi-\ndential Address which will be a real contribution to the theory\nof the puzzling phenomena which engage our attention.\nF. C. S. Schiller.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nThe Revue MetafsycMque for July-August has an interesting\naccount by Professor Cazzamali of Milan on his experiments on\nalleged radiations proceeding from the brain. The subject first\nattracted attention in 1912 when Prof. Cazzamali was employing\nthe sthenometer of Joise and when he came to the conclusion\nthat the movements of the needle were certainly not due\nentierement aux radiations thermiques des corps \"\n(p. 215).\nProceeding to more complicated apparatus he constructed an\nisolation chamber to assist in the experiments. This apartment,\nwhich in certain aspects resembles Dr. Boyd's experimental room\nin Glasgow for his work on the emanometer, is lined throughout\n\f160 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Deo;, 1925\nwith sheet metal ; the floor is of pine, mounted on porcelain blocks,\nani there is an opening in the roof to permit entrance and egress.\nThe main principle of the experiments is to ascertain the existence\nof brain \" waves \" from the subject by means of wireless tele-\nphonic ap])aratus. Various subjects have been tried and Professor\nCazzamali maintains that the unexplained noises heard in the\nreceivers are due to mental action on the parti of the subjects,\nor in his own words that from the human subject proceed \" des\noscillations electro-magnetiques dvi type des ondes radio-electriques.\"\nHow far Professor Cazzamali's conclusions will be confirmed by\nindependent observers remains to be seen, but that such inquiry\nis desirable seems obvious and would become even more necessary\nif the unexplained noises receive further confirmation through\nautomatic registration. Control would then consist in verifying\nindependently the times of the noises as registered and the times\nrecorded by the investigators when applying the various stimuli\nto the subjects. E. J.

Dingwall, Research Officer,\nand Miss Isabel Newton, Secretary.\nThe Minutes of the last Meeting of the Council were read\nand signed as correct.\nSix new Members were elected. Their names and addresses\nare given above.\nThe monthly accounts for November, 1925, were presented\nand taken as read.\nSAVAGE TELEPATHY.\nWe have received from Mr. Theodore Besterman the following\ncorrespondence concerning a case of ''savage telepathy:' The\ncase is an old one and no further enquiry is now possible, but\nit seems worth while to put the incident on record for comparison\nwith other similar incidents which are from time to time recorded\n\u2014Ed.\nFollowing a letter which I addressed to The Observer in reply\nto a query concerning savage telepathy, I received the following\ncommunication from Commander R. Jukes Hughes, R.N. (ret.) :\nWhiddon House, nr. Newton Abbot,\n2Qth October, 1925.\nI read your letter in the Observer of the 11th inst. with much\n\fJan-., 1926 Savage Telexiathy 3\ninterest, having had an experience of Native Telepathy. In the\nyear 1878, I happened to be serving upon a Govt. Commission\nin the Transkei (S.A.). Our Chief was Col. J. T. Eustace, E.M.,\nwith Kreli the Chief of the Gcalekas and the third member was\na Capt. T. Sansom. At the time I am writing of, our work was\nnear the right bank of the Bashee River (the S.W. boundary of\nthe Pondos). The Gcaika-Gcaleka War was recently over and\nthe Transkei was absolutely clear of natives. The Commission\nemployed about a dozen natives, but their work for the same\nkept them from roaming the country.\nOne day they came to us rather excited and announced that\nthere had been a great disaster in Zululand, that our troops had\nbeen overwhelmed by the Zulus, who were pouring into Natal.\nWe had an immediate consultation as to what we should do, as\nif the rumour was correct it was possible that a general rising\nof all the Kafirs west of the Tugela River would take place, in\nwhich case we should have to \" scuttle \" for the Old Colony with\nour horses and leave the wagons to their fate ; but within a few\nhours we had further news through the same agency stating that\nthe strain had been relieved\u2014this was the result of the noble\nstand made by the handful of troops at Rorke's Drift.\nNews of the disaster did not reach us officially until two days\nafter the event.\nWe were roughly speaking some 300 miles (as the crow flies)\nfrom the scene of the disaster Isandalwhana, with some very\nrough country between, including several rivers. For some years\nI lived under canvas on those parts so had a fair knowledge of\nthe difficulties of travel.\nR. Jukes Hughes,\nCommander, R.N.\n(retired list).\nI addressed a series \"f questions to Commander Hughes,\nwhich he very kindly answered to this effect\n:\nThe events occurring in Zululand were reported to us within\nan hour or so (if not quicker) of their occurrence.\nThe natives did not state from whom their information was\nobtained, this I should not have expected them to do. Not\nmany kraals, only principal ones, would have a Witch Doctor.\nIn my opinion it was absolutely impossible for natives to have\n\f4 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jan., 1926\nobtained the information by normal means, certainly not by\nwater communication.\nCommander Hughes gave his kind permission for his experi-\nence t--- be recorded in the Journal. This certainly seems to\nbe a cryptesthetic incident of a kind of which we possess far\ntoo few examples to justify any generalisations.\nTheodore Besterman.\nNOTE CONCERNING CASE No. L.1272.\nWith reference to the book-tests printed in the November\nJournal (Vol. XXII., p. 136), one or two enquiries having been\nmade as to whether the records were complete, as printed, or\nwhether any failures had been unrecorded, we wrote concerning\nthis question to Mrs. Kerr, by whom the original report was\nsent to us.\nConcerning these two results Mrs. Kerr writes to the Hon.\nEditor, Mrs. Baiter, thus :\nDecember 6th, 1925.\n... I enclose the list of the sittings Mrs. [Williams] and I had\ntogether from the time \" tests \" began to appear.\nYou will see from this that only one was a total failure. Mrs.\n[Williarns) had asked where a certain key she had lost had gone\nto, and the answer was wrong. The key was not there. But\nit was a confused sitting.\nThe other one about the pocket-book was also confused and\ncontradictory, owing, I believe, to our asking a lot of questions,\nwhich always leads to wrong answers being given. I suppose our\nminds are working hard and actively and suggesting answers,\ninstead of remaining passive, which is the condition for successful\n\" writing.\" M. L. [Kerr].\nIt appears from the detailed statement sent by Mrs. Kerr\nthat the test concerning the lost key was not a book test at\nall and need not therefore be taken into account in the series.\nThe test concerning the pocket-books, which though confused,\nwas not entirely without interest or value, may be reckoned\nas a book-test in so far as it was concerned with a book,\nbut it Avas of a rather different type from the other tests in\nthe series.\n\fJan., 1926 Minutes of a Group Meeting 5\nMINUTES OF A C4R0UP MEETING.\nWe have received from Mr. A. W. Trethewy the following\nReport of the Proceedings of a meeting of the Group he has\nbeen organising (see Journal for November, 1925, Vol. XXII.,\np. 133):\nPROCEEDINGS AT A GROUP MEETING HELD IN THE\nS.P.R. LIBRARY, Dec. 2nd, 1925.\nPresent.\nMr. T. Besterman. Mrs. Kingsley.\nMiss A. J. Case. Mrs. Leaning.\nMrs. St. John Clarkson. Mr. G. R. S. Mead.\nMiss L. Corry. Mr. H. and Mrs. Pennington.\nMr. G. a. de Zoysa. Miss Perkins.\nMr. B. Jordan Smith. Mr. A. W. Trethewy.\nMr. Mead took the chair by the request of the members and called\non Mr. Trethewy to open the discussion.\nMr. Trethewy read the minutes of the last meeting, and stated\nthat a satisfactory assurance having been received from the\nCouncil as to the favourable consideration of articles describing\nthe researches of the group for insertion in the Society's publica-\ntions, he had sent to more than fifty members of the Society a\ncopy of his letter printed in the November Journal, inviting them\nto attend the present meeting.\nHe then mentioned some communications from Professor Bozzano\nand others, offering help or making suggestions though unable to\nbe present.\nThe scope of the work was then discussed, and after consider-\nable debate it was decided that the research should embrace\npsychical phenomena of the following kinds :\n(1) All objective phenomena.\n(2) Subjective phenomena :\n(a) occurring in abnormal states of consciousness ;\n(&) occurring in dreams subsequently found to be veridical.\nIt was also decided that members who have not yet chosen ,\na\nbranch of the subject may do so, informing Mr. Trethewy of their\nchoice, and that members willing to read for the purpose of\n\f6 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jan., 1926\nresearch, but not ready to undertake any separate branch, may\nreport the result of their studies to Mr. Trethewy.\nFurther consideration of plans was deferred to another meeting\nto be held after the winter.\nA. W. Trethewy.\nA CASE OF HYSTERICAL AMAUROSIS.\nWe have received from one of our Members, Dr. Weston D. Bayley,\nof Philadelphia, a report, reprinted from The Hannemannian\nMonthly, August, 1925, on \" An Unusual Case of Hysterical\nAmaurosis.\" The patient, a man, thirty-six years of age, a barber\nby trade, was referred to Dr. Bayley by a local oculist, \" with\nthe comment that he could find nothing organically wrong with\nthe eyes, but desired to exclude the possibility of some intra-\ncranial condition which might be surgical.\" He was a married\nman with one child, and iip to the time of his loss of vision had\nalways enjoyed good health. Dr. Bayley writes:\nIn May, 1923, \" he gave to a friend a quart of blood, by\ntransfusion,\" with no ill effects. His present condition dates\nfrom November 3rd, 1923. He was then in his usual health\nand had worked all the morning, going home for lunch at\nnoon. On leaving the house at 12.30 he slipped on the icy\nporch, striking his shoulder and head ; but was apparently\nuninjured, thought no more about it, and continued his work.\nAt 2 o'clock he placed a customer in a chair for a shave.\nWhile handling the brush, vision suddenly became dim, and\nin a few minutes was reduced to mere light perception.\nDuring and before this there were no associated symptoms.\nNo headache at any time.\nHe was immediately taken to a local physician, and in two\ndays some vision returned, but six days later this left him\nentirely. He was then removed to a hosj^ital, and while\nthere had a return of light perception. This remained for\ntwo weeks, when six teeth were roentgenologically condemned\nfor removal. When the dentist pulled the first tooth the\npatient's light-perception immediately vanished, and he says\nblindness has been absolute ever since.\n\fJan., 1926 A Case of Hysterical Amaurosis 7\nDuring his time in hospital, Dr. Bayley says, the patient is\nalleged to have developed the power to \" determine the colour of\nobjects through the sense of touch.\" This faculty Dr. Bayley\ntested with negative results. Being puzzled by absolute \" blind-\nness, with nothing to show for it, and normal pupillary reactions,\"\nDr. Bayley called in an ocuUst, and \" strong suspicions developed\nof either malingering or hysteria.\"\nThe manner in which a cure was efEected is thus described by\nDr. Bayley :\nAt the time appointed he was taken into my office alone\nfacing against the well-lighted window. Dr. Mackenzie then\nplaced on the patient's nose a test frame with two strong\nprisms, and directed him to fix his eyes straight ahead. Soon\nwe noticed increased lacrymation. Then as Dr. Mackenzie\nmoved one prism, I noticed a concomitant muscular movement\nin the other eye. The patient remarked, \" I feel something\ntwitch.\" \" Yes,\" I said dramatically, \" and each time you\nfeel that twitch you will see a flash of light.\" Soon he saw\nthe flash of light. After a few repetitions, I said, \" Now you\nwill see the light of the window. Now you will see the\nwindow itself,\" and the suggestion worked. . . .\nVision was restored in this way in about twenty minutes ;\nso that when he got out of the chair he could see everything.\nHe rushed excitedly into the waiting-room to his mother and\nuncle who were waiting for him, and immediately wanted to\nphone to his wife that now he would be able to see her and\ntheir child.\nDr. Bayley discusses the question of malingering, but concludes,\nas a result of enquiry and observation, that this explanation is\nimprobable.\nREVIEW.\nThe Wisdom of the Gods. By H. Dennis Bradley. (T. Werner\nLaurie Ltd.).\nMr. Bradley divides his book into two parts : the first gives an\naccount of his sittings with various mediums of various reputations\nduring 1924 and 1925, and of the development of his own medium-\nistic powers ; the second deals with Valiantine's visit to England\n\f8 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jan., 1926\nin 1925, when, as on his previous visit, Mr. Bradley acted as his\nimpresario. This part contains Mr. Bradley's account of the S.P.R.\ninvestigation of VaUantine, and should be read in conjunction with\nPart 97 of Proceedings.\nThe position of such an impresario is a delicate one, and doubly\nso when he is, like Mr. Bradley, himself a medium. It demands\nqualities of patience and even temper which Mr. Bradley by his\nown confession does not possess. This comes out clearly whenever\nthe S.P.R. is mentioned.\nSeveral months before Valiantine came to England Mr. Bradley\nwas invited to have his own powers investigated by the S.P.R. ;\nbut at a sitting on the 18th October, 1924, at which he was the\nmedium, he was advised by his own \" control \" to refuse. He\nentered upon the S.P.R. investigations of Valiantine in a frame of\nmind which made success most improbable. The seance room, he\ncomplains, looked new : a gauze cage, which had been used in\nthe investigations of Willy Schneider (see Proc. Part 97) terrified\nhim : he was certain that a luminous spot on the wall, which\nmerely indicated the place of the electric light switch, was a trap\nof some kind. No explanations, however complete as to the\npurpose of the cage or the spot, could dispel his idees fixes :\nhis feelings became too much for him, and he \" smashed \" the\nfirst sitting in \" fury.\"\nWhen the S.P.R. sittings were transferred to Mr. Bradley's house\nthings went a little better, but after a very few more sittings\nMr. Bradley decided \" that he could not concede any further time\nto these experiments v\/ith the Society, whilst many of the great\nintellects of Great Britain were kept waiting for their personal\nexperience.\" Valiantine was allowed no say in the matter : he\nwas quite willing to \" concede \" more time and sittings to the\nSociety, but the imperious impresario interjjosed his veto.\nWe turn with expectancy to Mr. Bradley's \" great intellects of\nGreat Britain \" to find that, apart from Mr. Bradley's domestic circle\nand a round dozen members of the S.P.R., the sitters were com-\nposed approximately as follows : fifteen stage celebrities, eight writers\n(not perhaps of quite the first rank), one artist (ditto), one county\ncricketer, one parliamentary candidate, several score of doubtless\nworthy people unknown to fame, one anonymous statesman (\" one\nof the few really great men of intellect in Britain \"), and last,\nbut of course not least, Mr. Haunen Swaffcr, as to whom see\n\fJan., 1926 Eevieio 9\nJournal for November 1925. The anonymous statesman received\nfrom a truly \" great man \" recently dead the message, \" You must\nuse every endeavour to stop those wars. Tell . Tell the \":\na highly characteristic utterance, as will be generally agreed.\nOne of the sitters was an expert in finger prints, who examined\nthe impress of a \" spirit hand \" on a sheet of paper, but might\nhave been more usefully employed in examining the trumpets used\nat the seances for marks of finger-prints, spiritual or carnal.\nMr. Bradley seems to have little idea as to what tests of\ngenuineness should be applied to mediumship of Valiantine's type.\nHe complains of some of the S.P.R. sitters that their main ex-\nperience had been of physical phenomena, which he says do not\ninterest him, and of others that they had only sat with mediums\nof the type of Mrs. Leonard. He fails to realise that trumpet\nmediumship is ordinary trance mediumship accompanied by physical\nphenomena. So far as the phenomena are mental they must be\nstudied as e.g. Mrs. Leonard's have been, practically verbatim\nnotes of each sitting being taken and placed on record. So far\nas they consist of the production of voices from trumpets moving\nabout the room, they are physical, and, unless occurring under\nthe recognised conditions of control for physical mediumship, are\nnot worth consideration. Sir Oliver Lodge seems to have made a\nvaliant effort to get this into Mr. Bradley's head, but only to\nhave succeeded in arousing his temprt\".\n\\- The question of the genuineness of Valiantine's powers must be\nconsidered open. If, for instance. Lady Troubridge's record in\nProc. Part 97 is read, it will be seen that the medium made some\nfairly good hits, and one very bad mistake, viz., when his \" Feda\ncontrol \" mistook Mrs. WooUey for Miss Walker, whose place at\nthe sitting Mrs. WooUey had taken at short notice. Incidentally\nMr. Bradley reports this incident incorrectly :\n\" Feda-Valiantine\n\"\nfirst said \" Raymond . . . wants to speak to Miss Walker,\" and\nonly after this remark had caused a sensation was this altered to\n\" Raymond . . . wants to send a message to Miss Walker.\" On\ntwo other occasions the controls made somewhat similar blunders :\nwhen a Mr. Whaddia was addressed by the control as \"\nMr.\nMaddia,\" and when Miss Rebecca West was addressed by a \"\ngrand-\nfather West \" who never existed, her name being a nom-de-guerre.\nW. H. S.\n\f10 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jan., 1926\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nI. A Coincidence.\nTo the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.\nMadam,\u2014In the little coincidences of everyday life we experience\nour mild surprise because a connecting link we feel should be\nthere is missing. It is missing either because it does not exist\nor because we fail to notice it. Our surprise in the two cases\nis the same. Normally, the more striking the coincidence the\nmore disposed are we to suspect the existence of an unnoticed\nlink. I give here, however, an instance which, though it seems\nto me striking, appears attributable only to accident.\nOn the evening of (I believe) 18th Sept., 1925, my sister was\n\" listening in \" with ear-phones, when she remarked to my mother\nthat the wireless had just given a song which she had learnt as\na child, but, until then, had never heard since. She quoted a\nline which from memory I quote thus : \"A green (?) apple tree\ngrew out of his grave.\" At that moment I was reading the\nfollowing sentence which appears on p. 270 of Byioays of British\nArchaeology, by Walter Johnson (Cambridge University Press, 1912)\n:\n\" Not quite so well known is the theory that we have derived\nour custom of placing shrubs on graves from our heathen fore-\nfathers of the Bronze Age, who were wont to plant trees on their\nburial mounds.\"\nI will give in some detail the immediate steps I took to fix the\nincident in my memory. [An incident of a few days earlier date\nhad left me with the determination to record briefly and for my\nown use cases of coincidence personally experienced.]\n(ft) I at once (i.e. without finishing even the sentence) laid down\nmy book to listen to the conversation ; from which, I gathered,\nthe song may be called \" Cromwell's grave,\" and contains such\nrefrains as \" Hippity-hop \" or \" Lippity-lop.\"\n(6) I made no remark of any sort to those present, nor have\nJ since, concerning this incident.\n(c) When the conversation on that topic ended, I read to the\nend of the sentence, i.e. the word \" mounds,\" and no further.\n{(1) I immediately wrote a very brief account to a friend. I\ncannot remember if I caught the 9.0 p.m. or 4.4.5 a.m. post from\nthe neighbouring pillar-box.\n\fJan., 1926 Correspondence 11\nOne does not read word by word, but from the nature of the\ncase, I must at (a) at any rate have reached the words \" shrubs\non graves,\" while I believe the specific mention of the Bronze\nAge was noticed after picking up the book again (c).\nThe wireless was received from Daventry, there was no loud-\nspeaker, my sister alone was listening in.\nI had probably been reading for about a quarter of an\nhour, and had begun at the place at which I had previously\nleft off.\nOne small, though perhaps not unimportant point, I cannot\ndetermine, whether I stopped reading to listen to the conversation\nbefore I was aware of the nature of my sister's remarks ; but\nI laid down the book only after realising that there was coinci-\ndence.\nIn case they may interest you I enclose the name of the friend\nto whom I wrote [d), and some extracts, etc., from the book in\nquestion which bear on the point.\n1.

A Forgotten Memory Revived in a Dream.\nTo the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.\nFebruary 7, 1925.\nMadam,\u2014Some years ago my niece undertook to hand-print me\nsome Christmas cards to send away ; when finished she mislaid\nthem ; I inquired about them, but she told me she could not\nfind them. One day, when she entered the room, I said :\n\" I c?o\nwish you could find those cards.\" I was rather surprised that\nshe did not reply, but left the room abruptly. After a few\nminutes she returned with them in her hand, and said that when\nI spoke she suddenly remembered that on the previous night she\ndreamed that she saw them in a certain book. On recalling her\ndream she at once went to look for them, and found them there.\nH. A. Dallas.\nIII. To the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.\nMadam,\u2014I have spent some days considering Lady Grey's\nreply to my letter but find little help in her explanation, which\nmerely, as it seems to me, moves the responsibility one step\nbackwards. The problem is this : errors obviously due to mis-\nhearing of the English language occur fairly frequently in com-\nmunications. Since the transmission of the message, at least at\nthe source, is supposed to be independent of spoken sound, how\nis this to be explained ? I fancy that the point is worthy of\nconsideration, since the correct explanation may throw much light\non the mechanique of communication, while the failure to explain\nit must tend to discredit the messages.\nB.

HANS DRIESCH AS PRESIDENT.\nOur new President is already well known in England, where\nhe has many friends, and some of our members may remember\nhearing his lectures (in English) before the Universities of Lon-\ndon and Cambridge in 1913, on The Problem of Individuality.\"\nMore recently he lias published a further series of lectures\nentitled \" The Crisis in Psychology,\" reviewed in the S.P.R. Journal\nfor December, 1925. Dr. Driesch is distinguished both as a\nbiologist and as a psychologist, and he has always emphasised\nthe value of the contribution which Psychical Research has\nmade to recognised science. Formerly Professor of Philosophy\nat Heidelberg, he is now Professor of Philosophy at Leipsig.\nThe Society is fortunate in having secured so eminent a\nPresident for the current year.\nWe feel sure that our Members will welcome the oppor-\ntunity of hearing Dr. Driesch' s Presidential Address to be\ngiven on the 18th of March at the house of the British\nMedical Association. Particulars as to obtaining tickets for\nvisitors will be found on the front page of this Journal.\nMEETINGS OF THE COUNCIL.\nThe 224th Meeting of the Council was held at 31 Tavistock\nSquare, London, W.C., on Friday, January 29th, 1926, at\n2.30 p.m. ; The President in the chair.

The following Members were present : Mr. W. W.\nBaggally, Mr. Besterman, Mr. E. J. Dingwall, Mrs. E. J.\nDingwall, the Hon. Everard Feilding, the Kev. W. S. Irving,\nMiss Jephson, Sir Lawrence Jones, Bart., Mrs. Leaning, Mr.\nW. H. Salter, Miss Scatcherd, Mrs. Henry Sidgwick, and Dr.\nV. J. Woolley (and, by proxy. Miss Balfour, Lord Balfour,\nthe Right Hon. G. W. Balfour, Dr. T. W. Mitchell, The\nDowager Lady Rayleigh).\nThe Chairman presented the Report of the Council. Mr.\nW. H. Salter read the Report of the Council to the Meeting.\nThe Hon. Treasurer (Mr. W. H. Salter) in presenting the\nFinancial Statement said that he had nothing remarkable to\nreport this year. We could not expect to receive every year\nas much by donations as in 1923 and 1924 : this year we\ngratefully acknowledged a gift of \u00a3200 from a member who\nwished to remain anonymous.\nThe Society started the year with a balance in hand of\n\u00a3364 and ended with a balance of \u00a3703, an increase of \u00a3339.\nPart of this increase was due to the donation of \u00a3200, and\nalso a legacy of \u00a350. On the other hand there had been\nexceptional expenses in finishing the building of the Seance\nRoom, which amounted to \u00a368, and so it might be estimated\nthat the net increase in our income this year stood at about\n\u00a3140. LTnder the circumstances of financial retrenchment\nnow necessary in all ranks of life, and the fact that we were\npassing out of the unhealthy period of excitement over all\noccult matters which followed immediately after the war, on\nthe whole one might say that this was a very satisfactory re-\nsult. Discussion of the Repoii; was invited.\nThe Chairman announced that the six retiring Members of\nCouncil offered themselves for re-election. No other nomina-\n\fFeb., 1926 Annual General Meeting of Members 17\ntions having been received, the following were declared to be\nduly elected Members of the Council : the Hon. Everard\nFeUding, Dr. L. P. Jacks, Professor Gilbert Murray, Mr. J. G.\nPiddington Dr. F. C. S. SchiUer, and Dr. M. B. Wright.\nANNUAL REPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR 1925.\nThe year has been marked by the death of Sir William Barrett,\nthe last survivor of the founders of the Society and of its first\nCouncil. The Society in its forty-third year has thus entered\non what from a sentimental point of view may be described\nas a new epoch\u2014though without change in its aims or method,\nwhich continue what they have been throughout. This is not\nthe place to review the Society's work during those years, but\nthe Coimcil may be allowed to note with satisfaction the\ne\\'idence of increasing recognition of that work by philosophers,\npsychologists and men of science in England and abroad, and\nthe increasing degree in which, largely as the results of that\nwork, telepathy at any rate is regarded as a fact to be\nreckoned with, though we as yet know so little about it.\nMr. Piddington, when his first year as President came to an\nend, was asked to retain the office for the year 1925, and to\nour great satisfaction consented to do so.\nThe ordinary work of the Society has gone on through the\nyear much as usual. Though we should like to have more\nworkers, we cannot complain of any falling off, and are glad\nto welcome to the ranks of oru: active workers Mr. S. G. Soal,\nwho has contributed the valuable study on certain supernormal\ncommimications of which part was read at a meeting in July,\nand which was published in December.\nWe have to thank other members for material received.\nMr. W. S. Irving has allowed us to have records of communi-\ncations received by himself thi'ough Mrs. Leonard and other\nmediums, in which the communicator attempts to throw light\non the modus operandi of communicating. Mrs. Salter reported\non these at a meeting in February, and it is hoped that her\nreport wiU shortly be pubHshed. Several other members have\nsent us, or have shown to Miss Newton, notes of sittings with\nMrs. Leonard often too private and intimate, or for other\n\f18 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Feb., 1926\nreasons unsuitable, for publication. Though it cannot be\npublished, information thus furnished may be of real value in\nextending our knowledge of Mrs. Leonard's trance-phenomena,\nand making a comparative study of different sittings possible.\nWe wish to thank members who have communicated private\nrecords for their willingness thus to help in the Society's\nwork.\nOther evidence bearing on our work has been received, and\nas usual some of it has been, or will be, printed in the Journal\nor Proceedings, and other cases have been filed for reference.\nMr. G. H. Breaker, a member of the Society residing in Texas,\nU.S.A., had the ingenious idea of trying to get, through a\nmedium, particulars concerning a distant place which had been\nknown to his deceased father and grandfather but not to him-\nself. He afterwards visited the place and found that much of\nwhat the medium had said about it in a series of sittings was\ncorrect, and he was considerably impressed. Unfortunately the\nvalue of topographical details, for the most part of a not uncom-\nmon kind, is difficult to estimate, and it does not seem to us at\npresent that the results are sufficiently conclusive to justify\npubhcation. The case can, however, be studied at the Society's\nrooms, with Mr. Breaker's annotations and estimates of success.\nWe have also to thank certain members for assistance given\nto the Society's officers by enquiring into cases. In particular\nMr. Fryer has, as often before, looked into cases reported in\nthe press and elsewhere, and Mr. Henry Bury has done valu-\nable work by calling upon contributors of cases and talking\nover with them the experiences in question. Even when\nenquiries show a case to be worthless evidentially, the reports\non it are generally worth filing, and a personal interview often\nresults in more relevant information being obtained than would\nbe possible by correspondence, and the case may be thereby\nimproved.\nThe experiments in thought-transference at the Society's\nrooms were continued under Miss Newton's guidance during the\ngreater part of the year, but they have not been successful\nin throwing light on the conditions in which telepathy is likely\nto occur, which was the object for which they were originally\ndevised. A certain amount of apparent telepathy has, how-\n\fFeb., 192(3 Annual Report of the Council for 1925 19\never, been observed, and Miss Newton will be glad to hear\nfrom any members wbo think they may have power either as\npercipients or agents and would hke to test it.\nIn the course of these experiments Miss Ina Jephson thought\nthat, aiming at telepathy, she had several times received\nsuccessful impressions at the moment when the agent drew a\ncard from a pack and before he had seen it. This looked like\nclairvoyance, and to test this possibility Miss Jephson has tried\na long series of experiments on herself and others with results\nsuggesting some supernormal perception. We hope that later she\nwill send a detailed account of her experiments to the Society.\nThanks to the generosity of one of our members some\nsittings were held mth the American medium Mr. George\nValiantine, who was at the time the guest of Sir. Dennis\nBradley. The results were meagre but not without some\ninterest. An account of the sittings has just been published\nin Proceedings, Part 97. Turning to physical phenomena, a\nseries of experiments was carried out in April and May with\nthe Polish medium, Janusz Fronczek, invited to England for\nthe purpose. The results were unsatisfactory. An account\nof these experiments has just been pubhshed in Proceedings,\nPart 97, together with that of the experiments with WilK\nSchneider in 1924.\nJanuary and part of February were spent by Mr. Dingwall\nin America, sitting with the Boston medium \" Margery \" (Mrs.\nL. R. Gr. Crandon). The expenses of the journey were met by\na member of the Society Living in Boston, who also entertained\nMr. Dingwall during his visit.\nA report of the inquiry was drawn up by Mr. Dingwall and\nwill be published in Proceedings.\nIn the autumn ]\\Ir. Dingwall visited Austria and had sittings\nin their own homes with Willi and Rudi Schneider and Frau\nMaria SUbert.

Certain of these\n\f24 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Feb., 1926\nstatements, which were made in hypnotic trance, were published\nin two of the Greek newspapers and are translated in the present\narticle. They reveal a number of errors, striking omissions, and\nfacts which afterwards proved to be correct. These latter appear\nto Dr. Osty to be so striking that he asks whether the better\ntheory is to suppose that the whole is due to chance coincidence\nor that a supernormal power was indicated in the experiments.\nIn the same number is published an article by M. Sudre on\nthe glossary of terms used in psychical research, which promises\nto arouse a lively controversy ; and also an account of a very\nremarkable test with the Polish medium Ossowiecki, in which the\nlatter indicated knowledge, apparently supernormally acquired, of\nthe result of a photograph which was presented to him in its\nundeveloped state on the original plate, protected in a light-proof\ncovering. Not only did the medium show some knowledge of the\nactual picture, but also he gave a description of certain incidents\nwhich occurred at the time the plate was exposed and which\nwere proved correct.\nIn the same issue is an account of an undeveloped child with\nabnormal powers of musical appreciation.\nUnder the title of the Zeitschrift fur kritischen Ohhultismus appears\na new German periodical which is especially welcome. The editor\nis Dr. Baerwald of Berlin, and amongst its supporters are Dr.\nMax Dessoir, Count Carl von Klinckowstroem and others. It will\nappear at quarterly intervals, and will contain critical and scientific\nsurveys of modern literature and mediumistic investigations.\nThe first number is of such a high quality that this journal is\nlikely to take a leading place in German occult periodicals. Dr.\nMax Dessoir contributes an account of the alleged clairvoyant\nfaculties of Frau Helene Schnelle, and Dr. Bohn has an interesting\naccount of the history of apport mediumship. He considers\napports the most remarkable and the most suspicious of all super-\nnormal phenomena, and collects some of the sources of information\nregarding them from Dr. Dee to the present day. On a paper\non the so-called Od-rays, Hofmann examines some of the evidence\nalleged to favour the existence of these emanations, and comes\nto the conclusion that the supposed mechanical work which (it is\nsaid) can be performed by them has not been adequately demon-\nstrated.\nDr. Albert Hellwig, the Potsdam lawyer, contributes some\n\fFbb., 1926 Notes on Periodicals 25\nreflections on the Moll-Rudloff trial, witli special reference to the\npart played in one of the sittings by Dr. P. Siinner and Dr. Carl\nBruck.\nThe second issue of the same Zeitschrift has a critical and dis-\ncerning account by Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo on certain\nexperiments in clairvoyance with a private medium. The methods\nof the medium, which have in many respects a close resemblance\nto those employed by Mrs. Hester Dowden, are carefully recorded,\nand the Count completes his survey of the evidence by an acute\nanalysis of certain fundamental facts which are often entirely\noverlooked or partially neglected. Although some may question\ncertain conclusions of the Count regarding the a priori impossi-\nbility of some remarkable phenomena, it may plausibly be urged\nthat this view is founded upon a misconception of the true\nmeaning that is attached to certain expressions by those who\nattempt to describe the phenomena. However that may be, few\nwill dissent from the Count's vigorous attack on the '\"\nlaws\n\"'\nsupposed by spiritualists to govern the phenomena in question,\n\"laws\" which, he says, are invented either to favour the occur-\nrence of fraud or to help out an unskilful medium when he has\nbeen discovered in flagranti delicto. In the same number is an\ninteresting discussion by the editor, Dr. Baerwald, on the powers\nof the imconscious, and also some useful notes by Count Klinckow-\nstroem on the recent exposure of Guzik in Cracow. When con-\nfronted with the flashlight photographs showing how he had\nsucceeded in evading the control of his hands, Guzik is said to\nhave remarked :\n\" Well, yes, I helped myself out ! Everybody\ndoes it.\" In Count Klinckowstroem's notes on the case he com-\npares the facts with those ascertained in the cases of Kathleen\nGoligher, Eva C, Palladino and the Schneider Brothers, although\nit cannot be said that the control of Willi Schneider suffers from\nthe same weaknesses as those of Guzik. Dr. Tischner continues\nhis article on method in psychical research, and Dr. Hellwig\ncontributes a characteristic note on the Drost trial.\nPsychische Studien for December has an article bv General Peter\nof Munich on the genuineness of spirit photography, with especial\nreference to the \" beautiful evidential cases of psychic photo-\ngraphy \" provided by the medium, George Moss, at the British\nCollege of Psychic Science, Ltd. The author discusses the experi-\nments with the so-called magnetized plates,\" and expresses his\n\f26 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Feb., 1926\nbelief in the authenticity of the results, basing his judgment upon\nthe often-repeated assurances that there was no possibility of fraud.^\nThe same issue publishes some interesting notes on the recent\nDrost trial in Germany, and a remarkable history of a series of\nrustling and crackling sounds in a basket, which the author\napparently believes were supernormal and, in a sense at least,\ncontrollable by the will.\nPsychischen Studien for January appears in a new dress. It is\nnow called the Zeitschrift fur Parapsychologie, and appears to be\nsupported by a number of prominent Continental savants. It\nwould be interesting to discover whether any of these distinguished\npersons have protested against the publication in the present issue\nof a translation of an account by an American, Professor Pawlowski,\nof certain phenomena said to occur with the Polish medium,\nKluski. These stories have already appeared in English in two\nperiodicals, and contain material of an unusual character. Thus\nthe materialized lion (sic) at Kluski's sittings behaved on one\noccasion in a threatening manner, beating his tail and striking\nthe furniture. The squirrel (also materialized) was, however, very\nnatural, and the phantom dogs were most affectionate, sitting on\nthe laps of the observers and wagging their tails. The full form\nmaterialisations were most impressive. Judging from their steps\nand the inertia of their bodies. Prof. Pawlowski thinks they had\nnormal weight, but when the mood took them they flew above\nthe heads of the ecstatic sitters, executing fancy evolutions, and\nthus providing, as the professor expresses it, \"a beautiful sight,\na kind of aerial ballet [Ein schoner Anblick, eine Art Luftballett].^\nIn the same issue Baron von Schrenck-Notzing publishes a\nreport of supposed poltergeist phenomena in the presence of a\nfifteen year old girl in a small village in Upper Bavaria. He\nvisited the village and attempts were made to hold sittings,\nbut from the account it can hardly be said that the results were\n1 It ought to be added that at least four months before General Peter's\narticle the medium Moss was exposed, confessed, and was dismissed from\nhis employment.\n^ Such stories were common in the middle half of the nineteenth century,\nalthough M. Kluski seems to be almost alone in his materializations of the\ninhabitants of the jungle. At a seance in 1855 the medium, whilst under\ncontrol, mounted a buffet, which proceeded to gallop round the room in\nthe manner of a horse clearing about 1| yards at every jump. {York.\nSp. Teleg., Aug. 1855, p. 65.)\n\fFeb., 1926 Notes on Periodicals 27\nin any way conclusive. Dr. Tischner prints his address delivered\nat tie Drost trial, and a short note is published concerning a\nHungarian poltergeist case which is apparently exciting much\nattention in Vienna.\nThe Journal of the A.S.P.R. has an interesting account of the\nvoice-control machine invented by Dr. Mark Richardson of Boston\nfor verifying the independent voice alleged to be j^roduced at the\nsittings with the medium Margery.\" There are certain technical\npoints of great importance in this device, but above all the\nmethods demanded by Walter (the Control) for using it are sug-\ngestive. It would be worth trying to discover whether normal\nmethods could be employed to free the medium's mouth under\nthe precise conditions observed at the sittings. In his discussion\nof the device Dr. Richardson apparently believes that aU normal\nmethods have been eliminated, and in this he is supported by\nMr. Bird, although both craters do not appear to consider the\npossibility that by their attention to the apparatus they may be\nneglecting certain fundamental points in the method of using that\napparatus. However that may be, both Dr. Mark Richardson\nand Mr. Bird have failed to find any loophole for trickery in the\ndevice, and the next step would seem to be to vary the con-\nditions under the Control's direction until the independence of the\nvoice becomes self-evident in a convincing demonstration.\nIn the same issue Dr. Thirring of Vienna discusses the exposure\nof the medium Karl Krauss, and also gives a sketch of the\naccusations levelled against Rudi Schneider by Dr. Przibram and\nothers. The issue concludes with a review of the Hoagiand-Code\nalleged exposure of Margery \" in Boston, in which the new\npoint is brought out that the supposed private interview between\nCode and \" Margery \"'\nwas overheard by a third person, and that\nthis third party's affidavit disposes of Code's story of Margery's\n\"\nalleged confession and of Code's duplicity.\nIn the issue of September 9, 1925, of the Wiener Allgemeine\nZeitung appears an article by Professor Freud on the occult\nsignificance of the dream. Two classes of dreams, he says, should\nbe included amongst occult phenomena, the prophetic dream and\nthose showing the influence of telepathy. Freud thinks that the\nevidence for the former class is not nearly so strong as that for\nthe latter. Indeed, the evidence for telepathy is not only found in\ndreams, but in both spontaneous waking cases and actual experi-\n\fJournal of Society for Psychical Research Feb., 1926\nnients. Occasionally, however, the connection between a x^rophetic\nand clearly telepathic dream is only to be seen through an analysis\nof the statements made by the dreamer, or the medium, as the\ncase may be. In order to illustrate his meaning, Freud gives an\nactual case in which one of his patients related how some years\nbefore she had consulted a medium in a Parisian hotel. The\nmedium appears to have been more what is called in this country\na fortune-teller, and the information relative to the sitter's future\nwas in certain respects direct and precise. The prophecies, how-\never, were not fulfilled, and in the course of the psycho-analytic\ntreatment Freud claims to have discovered their origin in the\nunconscious wishes of the patient, who apparently, according to\nhis theory, passed them on to the medium telepathically, who\nreproduced them as prophecies. It is through the exercise of\npsycho-analysis that Freud looks for light on the more obscure\ntelepathic processes. B. J. j)\nREVIEW.\nThe Religion of Health. An Examination of Christian Science.\nBy Sir William Barrett, completed by Miss R. M. Barrett.\n(Dent. 3s. 6d. net.)\nAlthough the subject is not very closely connected with psychical\nresearch, many of our Members cannot fail to be interested in\nSir William Barrett's latest, and unfortunately last, book.\nSir William introduces the subject by a consideration of the\nphilosophic aspect of Christian Science, comparing and contrasting\nit with various types of idealistic philosophy which deny the\nultimate reality of matter, and proceeds to a discussion of its\nrelation to the more generally accepted forms of Christianity.\nAn interesting account is given of Mrs. Eddy's curious life-story,\nand of the spread of the movement, and the latter part of the\nbook discusses therapeutic treatment by different systems of faith-\nhealing and suggestion. This part of the book will be of par-\nticular interest to our readers, in view of the large part which,\nas Sir William points out, Members of the S.P.R. have always\nplayed in this branch of therapeutics.\nThe book is, as might have been expected, at once sympathetic\nand critical, and many who are not followers of Mrs. Eddy will\nfind it helps them to understand better a movement which has\nmade such astonishing growth in our time.

S. G. SOAL'S REPORT ON SITTINGS\nWITH MRS. COOPER.\nWe are proposing to print in the Journal several letters we\nhave received concerning Mr. Soal's paper in Proceedings,\nPart 96, including a criticism by Mr. H. D. Bradley and a reply\nby Mr. Soal.\nMr. Bradley's criticism has already appeared in the issue\nof Light of the 6th February, where it was accompanied\nby passages imputing unworthy motives to the Society : we\nare glad to note that in his present article Mr. Bradley tacitly\ndrops these imputations.\nIn view of the interest Mr. Soal's paper has aroused, we\nfeel justified in departing from our usual practice by printing\nan article substantially the same as one which has already\nappeared in another periodical. We must, however, remind our\nMembers that controversies arising out of articles printed by\nthe Society can most suitably be conducted in the Society's\nown Journal or Proceedings, where differences of opinion can be\ndiscussed frankly but courteously.\nAN ANALYSIS OF THE EXPERIMENTS OF MR. S. G. SOAL,\nM.A., B.Sc.\nBy H. Dennis Bradley.\nIn view of the various assumptions and asseverations contained in\nMr. Seal's report, it is necessary to analyse the evidence he\nadvances, and also to consider the sources from which it was\nobtained.\nMrs. Blanche Cooper, the medium with whom Mr. Soal held\nall his sittings, is what is termed a \" voice \" medium.\n\f30 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Maroh, 1926\nMr. Soal does not question the genuineness of this naedium, who\npractises at the British College of Psychic Science, but it is well\nknown to many psychical researchers that she is not a very fully\nor powerfully developed medium.\nAs Mr. Soal correctly states, on the occasions when voices\nmanifest they are only heard for a minute or two at a time,\nand such information as is given comes through in rapid snatches,\nand the \" voice \" seldom speaks in complete sentences.\nAt the majority of the sittings held by Mr. Soal, only he and\nthe medium were present. On the one occasion when eight persons\nwere present, Mr. Soal admits that those who were not sitting\nin the immediate vicinity of the person to whom the \" voice\n\"\nwas speaking could not hear the words which were spoken.\nDuring the entire series of Mr. Seal's sittings with Mrs. Blanche\nCooper, whenever a \" voice \" spoke, a musical box placed in\nthe room was playing the whole of the time. It will be realised,\nfrom the faintness of the \" voices \" (which could not be heard by\nothers in the room), and from the added distraction of music\nplaying at the same time, that Mr. Soal's hearing had to be\nparticularly acute to distinguish what was said.\nUnder the difficulties of such circumstances, through which\nmisunderstandings could easily occur, it is a point of scientific\nimportance to note that there is no corroboration whatever of\nthe many statements made by Mr. Soal in his report.\nAt seventeen of the twenty sittings held by Mr. Soal with\nthe medium, Mrs. Cooper, only he and she were present. He is\ntherefore unable to call upon any witnesses to corroborate his\nstatements as to the phenomena which took place. This is a most\nimportant point. With all my experience in psychic experiments\nI should never dream, even now, of advancing any statement\nwhatever as evidence of supernormal phenomena unless I were\nin a position to call upon other witnesses to confirm the state-\nments I had made.\nIt is one of the first principles of scientific and psychical\nresearch that corroboration must be forthcoming before it can\nbe accepted as evidence.\nDealing with Mr. Soal's personal record he states that he has\nan exceptional tendency to visualise words and articulate them\ninaudibly. This tendency may have\" proved a handicap to him\nin his investigations.\n\fMaech, 1926 Analysis of the Experiments of Mr. S. 0. Seal 31\nJVIr. Soal states that Mrs. Cooper's supernormal faculties exercise\nthemselves almost entirely on trivial aspects in the lives of\ndeceased personalities, and that in no case did the medium's\ntrance-consciousness occupy itself with subjects of intellectual and\nartistic interest. In fairness to the medium, however, it should\nbe noted that Mr. Soal only appears, according to his own report,\nto have asked questions about trivial aspects, and in no case\ndid he appear to endeavour to stimulate artistic interest by any\nof his conversations.\nMr. Soal, who, apparently, has had no other experiences of\n\" voice \" phenomena, presumes in his record that This case\nappears to emphasise the necessity of the existence of a physical\nlink relating the sitter to the deceased personality, and argues\nthe impossibility of obtaining in the absence of such a link\ninformation about a deceased personality which is not already\npresent in the mind of the sitter.\"\nThis theory of Mr. Seal's has been disproved hundreds of times.\nIt is disproved in several instances in my book. The Wisdom\nof the Gods, notably on page 403, when, on April 22nd, 192.5,\nthe purported spirit of Lord Curzon volunteered information\nregarding Dr. John Everidge, which was entirely unknown to\nany of the sitters, and which was afterwards proved to be correct.\nIn the series of sittings during which Mr. Soal records com-\nmunications in the \" voice \" through his deceased brother, he does\nnot criticise these in any way, but appears to accept them as\nverifiable communications of an intelligent entity. It is when he\nrecords the conversations with a fictitious communicator that his\ncriticism is aroused. The communicator, in this instance a\n\" voice \" purporting to be a \" John Ferguson,\" apparently gave\ninformation which Mr. Soal found afterwards to be incorrect.\nThe communications given were terribly mixed and indefinite.\nMany suggestions were put verbally by Mr. Soal to the communi-\ncator, who was unable to answer many direct questions.\nThe following is a typical instance :\nJIe. Soal. Where did you die ?\n\" Voice.\" My mind is confused. It was in a very large town.\nMe. Soal. In Brentwood ?\n\" Voice.\" No, not Brent, quite another place,\nand, at the next sitting :\nMe. Soal. Do you mean the house in Brentwood ?\n\f32 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Makch, 1926\n\" Voice.\" Yes, Brent.\nAt the following sitting, on November 24th, the \" voice \" of the\nguide \" Nada,\" in referring to \" John Ferguson,\" said, \" He is\nawfully worried because he cannot remember things,\" and it\nshould here be noted that many of the communications were\nmade, not by the purported spirit of \" John Ferguson,\" but by\nthe voice of \" Nada.\"\nThe \" voice \" of \" John Ferguson \" only spoke for a minute or\ntwo on the first four occasions, after which Mr. Soal appears to\nhave deliberately led this purported communicator on by various\nforms of suggestion.\nAt a later sitting :\nMe. Soal, I've just been to Brentwood and have found\nout that neither you nor your brother ever\nlived there. What do you say to that ?\n\" John Feequson.\" Pardon me, I did not say we lived there. We\nhad friends there.\nDuring the series of sittings Mr. Soal was constantly suggesting\nnames and places to the \" voices \" of both \" John Ferguson\n\"\nand \" Nada.\" This is a method which is never employed by an\nexpert investigator, and the attitude he maintained throughout\nwas certainly peculiarly brusque.\nAt the last of these sittings the following dialogue took place :\n\" Nada.\" It is wicked trying to confuse spirits.\nMe. Soal. I didn't try to confuse him.\n\" Nada.\" I think you did.\n\" Voice \" of Feank (Mr. Soal's brother). Think he got mixed up. . .\nHis mind was blank. He caught at any thoughts flying\nround.\nThe somewhat lengthy records and notes made by Mr. Soal on\nthis case seem to be quite valueless.\nIt is simply a case of impersonation or of a muddled spirit\nendeavouring to communicate. Impersonations often take place\nwhen the medium is not fully developed.\nThe case of Gordon Davis is one of the most absurd instances\nthat I have ever read recorded in psychic literature. It is of\nthe utmost importance to criticise and scrutinise these communi-\ncations and the unjustifiable deductions which Mr. Soal arrives at\n\fMarch, 1926 Analysis of the Experiments of Mr. S. G. Soal 33\nfrom them, because it is upon tliese communications that lie bases\na most illogical and ambitious claim.\nThis purported spirit, which Mr. Soal assumes to be that of a\nliving person, \" Gordon Davis.\" only uttered twelve short sentences,\nduring the delivery of which a musical box was dinning its\nmelodies the whole time.\nI have carefully checked the entire time which it would take\nto enunciate these twelve sentences, and the time is fifty seconds.\nMr. Soal states that immediately this \" voice \" began to speak,\nalthough the musical box was playing, he \" had a lightning im-\npression that the tone was quite familiar to him.\" This appears\nto me, as I shall show later, to be a very extraordinary assertion\nto make.\nI will quote verbatim, from Mr. Soal's report, the exact words\nsaid by the \" voice,\" which Mr. Soal advances as evidence of the\npersonality in question. I emphasise the word evidence.\n\" Voice.\" Remember Davis\u2014Gordon from R\u2014R\u2014Roch\u2014Roch\n\u2014\nWhen this sentence was enunciated Mr. Soal states \" This word\nwas not completed, but I easily understood it was an attempt to\nsay '\nRochford.'\n\"\nMr. Soal has no right whatever to assume any such thing, and\nsuch an assumption is entirely contrary to the methods of any\nexpert investigator.\nDirectly the voice had said :\n\" Remember Davis\u2014Gordon\u2014\n\"\nMr. Soal replied :\n\" By Jove, and it's like Gordon Davis, too.\"\nThe voice\" then went on to say :\nHow \u2022\nI always argued with H\u2014H\u2014Hs\u2014Hs\u2014 oh, confound\nthese names\u2014was for brighter geog\u2014brighter geography\n\u2014\nharpoons and things.\nIn replying to this sentence Mr. Soal said :\n\" I remember about\nyour arguing with Histed but nothing about harpoons.\" It must\nbe carefully noted that Mr. Soal gave the name of Histed, whereas\nthe \" voice \" never mentioned the name of Histed, but only said\n\" Hs.\"\nContinuing the conversation :\nMb. Soax. Try and tell me where you lived.\n\" Voice.\" At Roch\u2014you mean ?\n]VIe. Soal. That will do.\n\" Voice.\" Near the M\u2014Ma\u2014Malt.\na2\n\f34 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. March, 1926-\nAnd when Mr. Soal says to the \" voice,\" \" What proof can you\ngive me that you are 'Davis'\"? all that the \"voice\" can reply\nis :\n' Here, I must hold on\u2014not used to this.\"\nIt is necessary here to draw attention to the fact that the\n\" voice \" never gave the correct name, could not say where he\nlived and did not give the name \" Histed.\" All these names\nwere supplied and spoken by Mr. Soal. It is absolutely ludicrous\nto base an argument upon such a flimsy basis. No scientific\ninvestigator in the world would accept this nonsense.\nAfter this one sitting the \" voice \" in question never spoke again.\nAt the- only other sitting at which Gordon Davis was discussed,\nall the communications were given through the voice of the spirit\nguide, called \" Nada.\" It is therefore a case of absolute and\nunjustifiable assumption on the part of Mr. Soal, based upon no\nacceptable evidence whatever, that he should imagine that the\nvoice in question, which spoke for a few seconds only, was that\nof Gordon Davis.\nAt the second sitting Mr. Soal deliberately asks for Gordon\nDavis. During this sitting the voice of \" Nada \" gave many vague\nreferences and descriptions which would certainly apply to in-\nnumerable small households and circumstances. During this sitting\nMr. Soal himself volunteered several leads and names given by\nhim which were not confirmed by the \" Nada \" communications.\nAmong the many vague descriptions he managed to elicit from\nthe \" Nada \" communications, some of the important points were\nas follows :\n\" Nada.\" He says something about a funny dark tunnel\u2014It is\nto do with his house. There's five or six steps and a\nhalf. Very large mirror and lots of pictures. Pictures\nare all scenes (landscapes). Glorious mountains and\nthe sea\u2014there's one picture where a road or something\nseems to go between two hills. Some vases\u2014very big\nones with funny tops and saucers, but not to drink\nout of. There's a woman there now, and a little\nboy. Believe it's a woman fond of the country\u2014fond\nof flowers\u2014think it's his wife. Downstairs two funny\nbrass candlesticks\u2014on a shelf\u2014something right in front\nof his house\u2014not a verandah.\nIn answer to a question put by Mr. Soal regarding the '\nwife\n''\n' Nada \" replied that she could not describe her.\n\fMarch, 1926 Analysis of the Experiments of Mr. S. G. Soal 35\nLater, \" Nada \" says : (here again I quote verbatim)\nSomething about black dicky bird\u2014think it's on the piano\n\u2014\nnot sure about it.\nand again :\nHe's showing me the letter \" E \" and some figures, but I can't\nsee what they are. Two \" E's \".\nIt is upon this terribly confused description that Mr. Soal\ndares to assert that the voice gave an ''\naccurate description of\nthe environment and interior arrangements of a house which he\n(Gordon Davies ) did not occupy until a year later.\"\nMi. Soal asks for the address of the spirit as follows :\nMk. Soal. Could you give me the name of the street ?\n\" Nada.\" Get the letter \" E's.\"\nIt is on such a reply as this that Mr. Soal assumes the address\nto be \" Eastern Esplanade.\"\"\nIn the communications received a reference is made to a \" funny\ndark tunnel.\" This, Mr. Soal assumes, referred to a small open\narchway leading from the front of the small surburban villa to\nthe back garden, with the daylight apparently penetrating through\nfrom each end.\nMr. Soal states that when he interviewed the living Gordon\nDavis some little time later, he notices that Mr. Davis used the\nexpression \" old man \" t\\vice, and \" old chap \" once. In the few\nshort sentences spoken at the sitting by the voice,\" the term\nold chap \" was used in one of the sentences. Mr. Soal actually\nadvances the use of the term \" old chap \" as independent veri-\nfication of a personality. It is almost inconceivable that any man\nof intelligence could advance such an argument as the use of\nthe common term old chap \" as a proof of identification.\nWhen Mr. Soal discovered that Gordon Davis was still living\nat Southend, he visited him there, but says, to use his own words :\n\" I then briefly explained about my '\ndirect voice ' sitting and\ncommunicated to him (Gordon Davis) the somewhat astonishing\nnews that he himself had been the communicator at one of these\nsittings.\"'\nThis is surely the most astounding statement that has ever\ndeliberately been made by even the most credulous of researchers.\nThere has never been a case before built upon such vague\nsuppositions.\n\f36 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. March, 1926\nMr. Soal gives a long tabular analysis of what he calls evidence,\nbased upon the following points.\nThe \" voice \" of Nada told him that the communicator said to\nhim at a sitting :\n\" There is a woman there now and a little\nboy. Believe it's a woman fond of the country and country\nthings\u2014fond of flowers\u2014think it's his wife.\"\nThere are tens of thousands of wives with a child and ninety-\nnine out of a hundred women are fond of flowers.\nWhen the real Gordon Davis was questioned regarding harpoons\n\u2014an unusual weapon\u2014this was not confirmed. Davis merely says\nthat as a boy he collected various weapons, especially spears and\nboomerangs, etc.\nThe word M\u2014Ma\u2014Malt\u2014is assumed by Mr. Soal to mean not\neven the name of a house, but the house in which Davis lived\nand which had a malting at the back of it, and this house was\nsometimes called \" The Malting.\"\nThe only point which might possibly be assumed to indicate\nany evidential reference whatever was the volunteering by the\n\" voice \" of the name of Playle, but this sentence contained no\ndirect reference to Playle, which is a well known family name at\nRochford.\nThe reference made by the \" voice \" to the short conversation\nin the train about a little confab on the work of Guards conveys\nnothing whatever. Millions of people were talking about the work\nof the Guards during the war.\nIn the \" Nada \" communication, which is assumed to refer to\nthe house which Gordon Davis was living in, a reference is made\nto \" something\u2014not a verandah.\" This, Mr. Soal takes to be\nan evidential reference to a seaside shelter which was opposite\nthe house.\nThe \" voice \" of Nada says :\n\" Something about black dicky bird\u2014think it's on the piano\n\u2014\nnot sure about it.\"\nThis reference Mr. Soal regards as a strong evidential point.\nThe \" black dicky bird \" was not black at all. It was (I quote\nMr. Soal's own words) \" a small ornament in the form of a\nkingfisher, which stood on a black china pedestal.\"\nMr. Seal's report throughout is full of extraordinary mis-\nstatements. He asserts \" the communicator was able to give\naccurately the facts about the past life of Gordon Davis.\"\n\fMakch, 1926 Analysis of the Experiments of Mr. S. G. Soal 37\nNo facts whatever were given. Mr. Soal states that the com-\nmunicator gave the name of the house in Rochford. Another\ndeliberate mis-statement. The name was not given. It was\ngiven by Mr. Soal himself.\nMr. Soal states that the voice of the communicator produced\ncharacteristic mannerisms, accent, etc., and proceeds to assert that\n\" this, we (Mr. Soal, etc.), must consider to be in a certain sense\nfacts about the life of Gordon Davis, even though they were\nexpressed in dramatic form.\"' I must protest against the acceptance\nof such a statement by Mr. Soal. It is ludicrous. The description\nof the house which Mr. Soal describes as accurate is, on analysis,\nfound to be utterly inadequate. The address and the environment\nwere not given.\"\nThe \" voice \" was heard through the sounds of a musical box,\nand, according to Mr. Soal's own report, he says that although he\nand Gordon Davis were at school together, he hardly knew him,\nand, throughout the whole of his life, he can only recall one\nsingle conversation, and that, a conversation of half an hour,\nwhich took place when he met him in a train in 1916 (nearly\nsix years before the sitting), travelling between Shenfield and\nLiverpool Street.\nIt is extraordinary that although Mr. Soal says he cannot\nrecognise his brother's voice when the communications came\nthrough, yet the only \"voice\" he asserts he did recognise was\nthe one which he found afterwards to be that of a living person.\nMr. Soal's imagination is built up entirely upon disjointed and\nchaotic utterances.\nThe \" voice \" of the purported spirit of Davis Gordon or Gordon\nDavis did not volunteer one correct name with the solitary excep-\ntion of a vague reference to the surname Playle, of which name\nthere are many people. All the other names were verbally and\ninferentially suggested by Mr. Soal, a most deplorable and inexpert\nprocedure which would never be countenanced by any scientific\npsychic investigator. Mr. Soal even omitted to ask the names of\n\" the wife and the kiddie \" who were referred to. A most obvious\nquestion which could easily have been verified.\nUpon these flimsy and even ridiculous snatches of conversation,\nwhich as evidence would be derided and dismissed in any human\ncourt of law, Mr. Soal bases his material arguments.\nYet, according to his report, Mr. Soal is still apparently con-\nI\n\f38 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Makch, 1926\nfused in his own mind as to what he really does think, for he\ncommits two of the most blatant contradictions I have ever read.\nIn one part he says :\n\" It would be entirely illogical to describe\nthis case as one of '\ncommunication ' by a living person. All we\nare entitled to say is that a communication was received concerning\n'\nGordon Da^ris.'\"\nThen, a little later, he says, \" This dramatised personality\n(Gordon Davis), so accurate in its other statements apparently\nbelieves itself to be a deceased person.\"\nIt is easy to understand the confusion into which Mr. Soal\nallowed his industrious imagination to entangle his mind, but it\nis not easy to understand why he should presume to record a few\ndull, unevidential and often incoherent utterances as evidence of\nthe telepathic or sub-conscious mind theories.\nThere is one further point which Mr. Soal must explain scienti-\nfically. He does not appear to dispute the genuineness of the\nmedium. Nor does he appear to dispute the fact of supernormal\n\" voices \" speaking from sj^ace. What scientific explanation does\nhe offer of the means by which the sub-conscious mind can create\nan audible and intelligent sound from space ?\nA REPLY TO MR. H. DENNIS BRADLEY.\nBy S. G. Soal.\nMr. Bradley, at the close of his criticism of the Gordon Davis\ncase, remarks that the evidence would be derided and dismissed\nby any human court of law. Now in making this statement it\nseems to me that Mr. Bradley shows a complete lack of historical\nperspective in his total disregard of the kind of evidence which\npsychical research has had to deal with in the past. The com-\nparison with the court of law is misleading and irrelevant. Psychic\nresearch during its fifty years of existence has hardly ever had\nto consider the kind of clear, explicit and connected statement\nthat arises in a human court. It has had to consider evidence\nthat is always more or less elusive, and to deal with this evidence\nit has perfected a technique that is based largely on the laws of\nprobability and the careful study of coincidences. What considera-\ntion I ask Mr. Bradley would the book tests of Mrs. Leonard\nreceive in a human court ? Would they not also be derided and\n\fMarch, 1926 A Reply to Mr. H. Dennis Bradley 39\ndismissed ? Yet a careful experimental analysis of tHese tests based\non the theory of probability affords a scientific demonstration of\ntheir supernormal character. A human court of law could have\narrived at no such conclusions by applying its ordinary methods\nof procedure.\nI venture to think that in vividness and clearness of detail my\nrecords compare favourably with any that have been produced in\nthe past, and are not inferior in this respect to either the Piper\nrecords or the Leonard reports. Indeed, T will go so far as to\nsay that had the details been more vivid and connected than is\nactually the case grave suspicion would have been thrown on their\nauthentic character as psychic records. In the eyes of the serious\nstudent the very excess of clearness and precision would probably\nhave appeared as a contradiction to all that has been taught us\nby the past w-ith regard to the difficulties that arise in the\nprocess of transmission.\nIn his criticism of the Gordon Davis case, Mr. Bradley seems to\nl)e entirely unaware of the inevitable difficulties that are associated\nwith the telepathic and other methods of psychic transmission of\nideas. He expects, apparently, that proper names should be\ngiven in full in every case, and he seems quite unaware that\nexperimental telepathy has established that it is often an associated\nidea rather than the original idea that emerges in the mind of\nthe percipient. I will give an example. At the commencement of\nthe first sitting \" Davis \" speaks as follows :\n\" Remember the old\nschool ? How I always argued with H\u2014H\u2014Hs\u2014Hs\u2014 oh, confound\nthose names\u2014was for brighter geog\u2014brighter geography\u2014harpoons\nand things.\"\nNow it subsequently transpired that the real Gordon Davis,\naccording to his own story, had been exceptionally interested in\ngeography lessons at school, and to illustrate these lessons brought\nto school spears, boomerangs, and other savage weapons. Mr.\nBradley, by the way, who professes to quote my record verbatim,\nleaves out the important phrase, \" Remember the old school ? \" and\nthen most unfairly concludes that I had no right to assume\nthat the \" Hs \" syllable repeated at least twice was intended\nfor the name of our old geography master, Histed. Now without\nany suggestion from myself Mr. Davis understood the whole\nreference the moment he read it on the typed script\u2014both the\nname Histed and the reference to harpoons. It is what the phrases\n\f40 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March, 192(>\nconvey to Mr. Davis and not what they convey to Mr. Bradley\nthat is important. What may possibly have happened is this.^\nThe fragment of memory that called itself Davis may have been\ntrying to recall the spear that was brought to school and the\nsimilar weapons that the real Davis had collected. Unable tO'\nhit upon the word spear or boomerang it is conceivable that the\n\" communicator \" seized upon some associated memory, with the\nresult that \" harpoons and things \" was substituted as an approxi-\nmation to the idea he wished to convey.\nNow let us see how Mr. Bradley deals with this incident. He\nsays :\nWhen the real Gordon Davis was questioned regarding\nharpoons\u2014an unusual weapon\u2014this was not confirmed. Davis\nmerely said : that as a boy he collected various weapons, especially\nspears and boomerangs, etc.\"\nHaving first omitted the phrase :\n\" Remember the old school,\"\nwhich is the key-note to the whole conversation, Mr. Bradley\nnow entirely ignores the obvious fact that the phrase \" harpoons\nand things \" follows directly after the statement, \" how I always-\nargued with H\u2014H\u2014Hs\u2014Hs\u2014 was for brighter geog\u2014geography,\"\nand must be read in connection with it. The whole pith of the\nmatter lies in the fact that the real Gordon Davis actually\nremembered bringing spears and other weapons to school in order\nto brighten up our somewhat dull geography lessons. The sub-\nstitution of the words \" harpoons and things \" for \" spears and\nthings \" caused Mr. Davis himself no difficulty in identifying the\nallusion immediately he read it. From what we know of experi-\nmental telepathy substitutions such as these are to be anticipated,\nand a man who expects a psychic communicator to call a spade\na spade ought himself to be compelled to use one.\nBefore proceeding to the question of corroboration, I want to\nanalyse Mr. Bradley's attack on the Gordon Davis case.\nMr. Bradley begins by saying :\n\" I will quote verbatim, from\nMr. Soal's report, the exact words said by the '\nvoice,' which\nMr. Soal advances as evidence of the personality in question.\"\nMr. Bradley does not quote my record verbatim. He omits the\nphrase, \" Remember the old school ?\n\" and I shall show later on\nthat he deliberately alters the wording of a certain phrase in order\nto make it fit in with a particular interpretation of his own.\nMr. Bradley says I had no right whatever to assume that the\nsyllable \" Roch \" was an attempt to give the name Rochford.\n\fMarch, 1926 A Reply to Mr. H. Dennis Bradley 41\nI make no such assumption. I merely record a coincidence. I do\nnot mention either the syllable \" Koch \" or the word Rochford\naloud during the whole of this sitting. I cannot help the word\nRochford coming into my mind. Mr. Bradley does not mention\nthat the syllable \" Roch \"\u2014is given not only twice at the beginning\nof the sitting, but also once in the middle, after an interval of\nsilence. When it is remembered that I had lived just outside\nRochford for years and had walked its streets thousands of times,\nand that I knew Gordon Da^ds was brought up and bred at\nRochford, it would certainly appear that the coincidence is^_ a\nrather remarkable one.\nMr. Bradley says :\n\" Mr. Soal actually advances the use of the\nterm '\nold chap '\nas independent verification of a personality.\"\nLet me remind Mr. Bradley that this item is only one of a number\nof noted coincidences between the mannerisms of the communi-\ncator and the real Gordon Davis. Whether it is strong or weak,\nit is my duty in a scientific record to note every coincidence.\nSuppose, for instance, that it had turned out that the real Gordon\nDavis had entertained a pet aversion to the phrase '\nold chap '\n\u2014\n\u2022\nas I happen to do myself. In that case I might have been\naccused of suppressing an important piece of negative evidence.\nIt is the accumulation of coincidences slight in themselves which\ntogether make up a case for the identity of personal mannerisms.\nThe total ensemble was so convincing to Mr. Davis that when he\nread it he laughed heartily at the quaint parody of his own terms\nof phrase.\nMr. Bradley goes on to say that the name of the house at\nRochford was not given, and that I am guilty of a mis-statement\nin saying that it was. Now the actual conversation on this subject\nreads as follows :\nMr. Soal. Try and tell me where you lived.\nVoice. At Roch\u2014you mean ?\nMe. Soal. That will do. '\nXoic^. Near the M\u2014Ma\u2014Malt. .\nNow at the time of the sitting I had not the slightest idea that\nMr. Davis had lived near the Malting at Rochford. I cannot,\ntherefore, be accused in this instance of mis-interpreting what was\nsaid. I simply recorded it, yet when I showed this record to\nGordon Davis himself he immediately understood that the word\n3Ialt stood for the Malting at Rochford. Ask any old Roch-\n\f42 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March, 1926\nfordian who remembers the days when Gordon Davis lived at\nRochford, where in Rochford the house was, and he will reply,\nI will wager, in nine cases out of ten, \" near the Malten\/'\n(dialect for Malting). I produce a piece of definite evidence on\nthis point. On February 16th, 1926, I addressed a letter to Mr.\nT. B. C. Histed, a well-known and respected resident of Rochford,\nwho has lived there for upwards of thirty years. Mr. Histed has\nnot read my report as it apjaears in the Proceedings, but merely\nthe brief extract that appeared in the Daily News. In answering\nmy questions, therefore, he is not influenced by any preconceived\nmotions or interpretations. In my letter I asked him the following\nquestion :\n\" What do you consider the following would suggest to\nany old Rochfordian ?\n\" '\nG. D.' speaking says :\n'\nRemember Playle and 0\u2014Over\u2014Over\u2014.'\nAlso, do you consider that the phrase '\nNear the Malt ' gives an\nadequate idea of the location of Gordon Davis's house at Roch-\nford ?\n\"\nMr. Histed's reply dated February 17, 1926, reads as follows\n:\n\" '\n0\u2014over\u2014over '\nof course means Overell (either Cliff or Leonard).\n\" ' Near the Malt ' is a concise location of Gordon Davis' house\nAvhen he lived here. If I have not answered definitely enough\nplease ask again. I have an open mind re your researches.\"\nIn the face of this evidence it is a mere quibble for Mr. Bradley\nto maintain that the name of Gordon Davis' house was not given.\nAs a matter of fact, as I have pointed out in my paper, the\nhouse was actually called \" The Malting.\"\nMr. Bradley states :\n\" This voice of the purported spirit of\nDavis Gordon or Gordon Davis did not volunteer one correct\nname with the solitary exception of a vague reference to the\nsurname '\nPlayle,' of which name there are many people.\" He\nforgets to mention that the name \" Playle \" was given in con-\njunction with the syllable \" Over\u2014 \" repeated twice, which any\nRochfordian would recognise as an attempt to give the name\n\" Overell.\" Not only did Mr. Davis so recognise it, but Mr.\nHisted does also. Mr. Bradley further ignores the fact that\n\" Playle \" was actually a friend of the real Gordon Davis who has\nrecorded in his diary that he interviewed this friend \" Playle\n\"\non January 6th, 1922, just two days after the first sitting. Mr.\nBradley also ignores the fact that the families \" Playle \" and\n\" Overell \" were close friends.\n\fMarch, 1926 A Reply to Mr. H. Dermis Bradley 43\nI come now to examine a piece of criticism which, with its\nsuperb negation of every law of human probability, is destined,\nI believe, to become one of the classics of absurdity. I refer to\nMr. Bradley's \" analysis \" of Nada's description of the future\nhouse. His method, so far as I have been able to discover any,\nseems to consist in taking each detail of the description, holding\nit up to ridicule and arguing that it would apply to \" innumerable\nsmall households.\" Thus he says :\n\" There are tens of thousands\nof wives with a child, and ninety-nine out of hundred women\nare fond of flowers.\" jSTo one will dispute this, and no one will\ndispute that there are thousands of houses with a pair of brass\ncandlesticks in the basement, other thousands which have some-\nthing answering to the description of a verandah in front of them,\nand so on for most of the other details. But surely it is obvious\nthat what is important is the simultaneous coincidence of a large\nnumber of items, each one of which is found to fit the living\nGordon Davis. Further, not one statement {excepting the account\nof his death) given by either Gordon Davis or Nada tvas found to\nbe inapplicable to the real Gordon Davis.\nLet us see what mathematics has to say on the question.\nTaking an estimate that is ridiculously low we may safely assert\nthat not one person in .500 will have among his acquaintances\nanyone of the name of Gordon Davis (or Davis Gordon). Not\none in 1,000 houses in Great Britian, on the average, would have\nanything that could be even remotely described as \"a funny\ndark tunnel.\" The chance, therefore, of the simultaneous coinci-\ndence of these two events is understated at 1\/500,000. Not one\nin a hundred houses in England will be fronted by anything that\nresembles a verandah as much as the little seaside shelter that\nstands in front of the Southend house. Not one in a 1,000 houses\nwill contain a piano with a bird of any description on it. The\ndenominator of the fraction that denotes the chance of coincidence\nof these four simultaneous events is 500,000 x 100,000, or several\nscore times the total number of houses in Great Britain. And\nwe have still the candlesticks, the pictures, the saucers, the two\n'\nE's '\nrepresenting the name of the street, the fact that the house\nis joined up to others, the \" five or six steps and a half \" ?'n front,\nthe wife and the little boy to take into consideration. There is,\nfurther, the condition that the owner of the house must have\nlived at a place whose first syllable is Eoch\u2014 and his house\n\f44 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March, 1926\nthere must liave been near something called \" The Malt.\" More-\nover the sentence \" Remember the old school ?\n\" clearly imposes\nthe further condition that the Gordon Davis mentioned must have\nbeen a schoolfellow of the sitter.\nWe must now add to the other descriptions the following\nincident related by the communicating Gordon Davis. \" Remember\nour last talk ? \" i\n'\n'i-\nS. Yes, I do quite well. Where was it ?\n\"\nVoice. \" In the train\u2014about guards\u2014not train guards though. A\nlittle confab on the work of guards. That help you ?\n\"\nS. \" I can recall it excellently.\"\nMr. Bradley's treatment of this incident of the conversation\nin the train affords another brilliant example of the startling\nquality of his logic. He says :\n\" The reference made by the voice\n'\nto the short conversation in the train ' about a little confab,\non the work of Guards, conveys nothing whatever. Millions of\npeople were talking about the work of tlie Guards during the war.\"\nThe italics are mine. It will be noted that Mr. Bradley in both\nthese sentences spells '\nguards ' with a capital '\nG ' and that in\nthe second sentence 'guards' has become \"the Guards.\" :\nThe conversation in the train had nothing to do with the work\nof \" The Guards,\" but was a discussion of the differences in the\nceremonial of mounting guard in the infantry as compared with\nthe artillery.\n'\nIt will be seen that Mr. Bradley has tried deliberately to\nobscure the whole issue. The value of the incident is to be found\nin the very definite reference which Davis makes to his last\nmeeting with the sitter in the train, and in his being able to\nrecall the main topic of conversation which concerned the cere-\nmonial of mounting guard in the infantry as well as the artillery.\nThere had been nothing in the previous conversation to lead Mrs.\nCooper to guess that my last conversation with Davis was a\nwar-time conversation. It might, for all Mrs. Cooper knew, have\ntaken place in a hundred places other than in a train. We might\nhave talked of a thousand different things other than the duties\nof mounting guard. The chance of coincidence between two such\nentirely unconnected and definite events as the correct statement,\nof the meeting place and the main topic of conversation must be\ninconceivably small.\nI must draw attention to some further examples of Mr. Bradley's:-\n\fMarch, 1926 A Reply to Mr. H. Dennis Bradley 45\ntrick of quoting isolated phrases and entirely ignoring the context.\nHe says : \"... and again :\nHe is showing me the letter '\nE ' and some figures, but I\ncan't see what they are. Two E'.s\"\nMr. Bradley does not mention that I proceeded to ask Nada\nwhat the letter \" E \" meant, and received the reply, \" Feel sure\nthat it has to do with the address of his wife.\"\nIn the next sitting I ask\n:\nMe. Soal. \" Could you give me the name of the street ?\n\"\nNada. \" Get the letter '\nE's.\"\nMr. Bradley quotes this and comments on it as follows :\n\"It is on such a reply as this that Mr. Soal assumes the\naddress to be \" Eastern Esplanade.\"\nAgain I must reply that I ?nake no such assumption. I am\nmerely recording a coincidence. I go on recording coincidences\nuntil an overwhelming number of coincidences are obtained, until,\nin fact, I am able to challenge Mr. Bradley to lay his hands on\nanother single house in Great Britain which, with its owner,\nsatisfies the descriptions given at the sittings.\nWith regard to the passage-way which leads to the back pre-\nmises of Mr. Davis' house, the expression \" funny dark tunnel\n\"\nused by Nada impresses everyone who has actually seen it as an\nexcellent description. I do not think such \" tunnels \" are to be\nfound elsewhere in the whole of Southend. Moreover, the seaside\nshelter which is precisely opposite the gateway of the house,\nreminds one very forcibly of a verandah, and there is actually a\nverandah round the roof of this structure.\nMr. Bradley says : \"Mr Soal even omitted to ask the names\nof '\nthe wife and the kiddie '\nwho were referred to. A most\nobvious question which could easily have been verified.\"\nThis is another mis-statement by Mr. Bradley. On page 565\nof my report, item 52, I ask concerning the wife, \" Could you\ndescribe her or give her name ?\n\" The name was not forthcoming.\nMr. Bradley says :\n\" Mr. Soal is still apparently confused in his\nown mind as to what he really does think, for he commits two\nof the most blatant contradictions I have ever read.\" He then\ngoes on to misquote me as saying : \"It would be entirely illogical\nto describe this case as one of '\ncommunication ' by a living\nperson. All we are entitled to say is that a communication was\nreceived concerning Gordon Davis.\" What I actually said was\n:\n\f46 Journal of ISociety for Psychical Research March, 1926\nIn discussing this remarkable case it would be perhaps entirely\nillogical, although practically convenient, to describe the case as\none of '\ncommunication '\nby a living person. . . . We know that\nhis conscious mind was busy interviewing clients on both occasions\non which he was supposed to communicate. All that we are\nentitled to say is that a communication was received concerning\nGordon Davis ; that is to say, certain facts were communicated\nabout his life-history, past and future.\" I fail absolutely to see\nany \" blatant contradiction \" between the above statement and\nthe Avords \" this dramatised personality which is so accurate in\nits statements apparently believes itself to be a deceased person.\"\nIs Mr. Bradley so ignorant of the technicalities of psychic research\nas not to understand that a dramatised communicator is not\nnecessarily a real person, but may be, as in the case of James\nMiles, a mere figment of the mind masquerading as a real person ?\nI will now deal with the question of corroboration in so far as\nit affects the case of Gordon Davis. In the case of John Ferguson,\nI have already stated quite clearly in my paper that the case\ndepends essentially on my own honesty. The details given in\nthat case, which extended over ten weeks, are of an exceptionally\nclear and vivid character, and unless my own honesty is disputed,\nI do not think the case can be explained away. With regard to\nthis case of Ferguson it would be quite open for me to take an\nentirely different standpoint. I might regard the case as one that\nawaits confirmation by other observers. It is true that experi-\nmental control has not yet been established in psychic research\nas in the physical sciences, but this control may be forthcoming\nany day. It might come, for instance, by the discovery of some\npowerful drug which would facilitate and multiply the production\nof all kinds of supernormal phenomena. The mere fact that a\ncertain piece of work awaits confirmation by other experimenters\nis no argument against its being published\u2014especially if it shows\na reasonable acquaintance with the technique of the subject and\nis moreover a verbatim record.\nMoreover, \" corroboration \" does not necessarily mean having\nwitnesses present at the sitting in a case like that of Gordon\nDavis, where many of the facts given could not possibly have\nbeen known to the sitter at the time of the sitting. I want to\nemphasise what are the salient features of the Gordon Davis case.\nOne whole sitting is devoted to a description of a house, which\n\fliiAECH, 1926 A Reply to Mr. H. Dennis Bradley 47\non January 9, 1921, the date of the sitting, was not occupied by\nthe real Gordon Da^ds. The house and its contents for all\npractical purposes did not come into being as the residence of\nthe Davis family until December 13th, 1922, almost a year after\nthe time of the sittings. Now we have a witness, a science\ngraduate of St. Catherine's College, Cambridge, who testifies that\nhe read during the vacation of January, 1922, the description of\nthe future house from the same book from which the typed\ncopy was made that was handed to ]\\Ir. Da^as in April, 1925.\nIt is not a question of how much my brother remembers of the\nGordon Da^ds case. The importance of his testimony consists in\nthe e\\'idence it affords that the same record which was presented\nto Mr. Davis in 1925 was already in existence in January, 1922.\nNow I have already shown that the description of the future\nhouse cannot be explained away as a chance coincidence. The\nlaws of probability rank themselves inexorably against such an\nexplanation. There remains, therefore, only the supposition of a\ncollusion between my brother and myself. On his visit to South-\nend on September 19th, 1925, Mr. W. H. Salter of the Council\nof the S.P.R. saw the house and its contents, and, excepting the\nremoval of two desert scenes which had been transferred to a\nbedroom, Mr. Salter found no descrepancy in the descriptions\npreviously given by myself and Mr. Davis. Mr. Salter inspected\nMr. Davis' diaries, and states that Mr. Davis fully confirmed\nMr. Soal's statements as to their previous acquaintanceship, his\nlack of interest in psychical matters, and the circumstances under\nwhich he became interested in No. 54, Eastern Esplanade.\"\nHe also, I understand, formed a favourable impression of the\npersonality of Mr. Davis.\nThe fact that every detail given by Nada and Gordon Davis,\nexcept the account of the latter's death, was actually verified, and\ncorresponds with reality, is in itself an argument in support of\nthe contention that my records at the sittings were exact. I would\npoint out further that the mere fact of having witnesses\npresent at the sitting (even if this had been practicable or useful\nin my own case), would not have been even a reasonable guarantee\nthat the information given was definitely supernormal. If I had\nwanted to produce spurious records, all that it would have been\nnecessary for me to do would be to interview Mrs. Cooper in\nthe intervals between the sittings and deliberately suggest various\n\f48 Jotirnal of Society for Psychical Research Maech, 1926\nnames and incidents to her conscious mind. Alternatively I could\nhave had a series of sittings at which witnesses were present, and\nhave interpolated other sittings at which I deliberately suggested\nsuch incidents or names. The memory of professional mediums is\nnotoriously short, and I feel quite confident that the \" direct\nvoice\" would have reproduced many of my suggestions, in the\npresence of a room full of witnesses.\nMr. Bradley says that in the first sitting Gordon Davis uttered\ntwelve short sentences, which would take just fifty seconds to\nenunciate. He does not mention that these twelve sentences are\nbroken by two considerable intervals of silence. In any case,\nwhat have the fifty seconds to do with the matter ? Let him\nremember that kings have been dethroned in fifty seconds. Let\nme also assure him that listening to Mrs. Cooper's voices while\nthe musical-box is playing is simply a matter of practice and\nnothing else. To say that it is difficult or impossible would be\nas absurd as to contend that Sir Henry Wood cannot discern the\nslightest mistake in the piccolo or the wood winds amid the\nterrific din of the orchestra. I am not a Sir Henry Wood, but\nI have trained myself, at least to some extent, in picking out\nvarious instruments in an orchestra.\nI have reason to believe that the trumpet was held quite close\nto my ear while conversation was being carried on, and after a\ntime I found the efiort of listening to the voices far less dis-\ntracting than say\u2014trying to carry on a conversation in a railway\ntrain. In cases where syllables were articulated in attempts to\ngive proper names I have, I believe, in most cases in my report\nunderstated the number of times that a syllable was uttered.\nI was most careful not to record anything unless I was certain\nit was actually clearly given.\nIn connection with the case of John Ferguson, Mr. Bradley\nmakes the following statement. \" The somewhat lengthy records\nand notes made by Mr. Soal on this case seem to be quite\nvalueless.\n\"It is simply a case of impersonation or of a muddled spirit\nendeavouring to communicate. Impersonations often take place\nwhen the medium is not fully developed.\"\nThis judgment, given without analysis, without adequate dis-\ncussion, without even any intelligent notice of the problems which\narise in the case, I am content to leave to the verdict of all\n\fMarch, 1926 A Reply to Mr. H. Dennis Bradley 49\nreaders of the Proceedings and Journal. There is one statement,\nhowever, which I must notice. Mr. Bradley says :\n\" During the\nseries of sittings Mr. Soal was constantly suggesting names and\nplaces to the '\nvoices ' of both '\nJohn Ferguson '\nand '\nNada.'\nThis is a method which is never employed by an expert investi-\ngator, and the attitude he maintained throughout was certainly\npeculiarly brusque.\"\nNow I have gone carefully through the \" Ferguson \" record,\nand I find that during the whole ten sittings there are only three\noccasions on which I ever suggested a proper name to \" John\nFerguson \" or \" Nada \" which had not been -previously given by\nthese communicators themselves. Two of these occasions are quite\nunimportant. On page 528 of my report, after \" John Ferguson\n\"\nstates that he was an engineer, and mentions \" a room with big\nmachines,\" I ask the question, \" Was this in London 1 \" and he\nreplies :\n\" It might be London.\" On page 542 in order to see\nhow the communicator would re-act, I deliberately asked the\nquestion :\n\" Were you ever at Gibraltar ?\n\" The only other\ninstance occurs on page 542, when in an attempt to elicit the\nresidence of \" Shoeshine \" I suggest the names Southend-on-Sea\nand Portsmouth. This resulted in my obtaining the name Ply-\nmouth or Plym\u2014 which turned out to be the name of the place\nto which Captain Shoesmith had removed. The name was quite\nunknown to me at the time of the sitting, and my questions\nwere, therefore, quite justified by the result. I want to point out\nthat all the other names I used in my conversation with \" John\nFerguson \" had been previously given by \" Nada \" or himself. Such\nnames were Brentford, Highland, Onget Road, Warecott Road,\nShoeshine, etc. I had a perfect right to use these names in\ncarrying on the conversation with \" John Ferguson.\" My whole\nobject was to prevent him from wandering too far from his\nprevious statements.\nMr. Bradley speaks of my \" telepathic or subconscious mind\ntheories.\" I want to point out that when I have used the term\n\" telepathy from the sitter \" I use it not to denote a theory but\nsimply as a name to cover a certain peculiar class of observed\nmental coincidences. Beyond a passing allusion to the time-space\ntheory, I have restricted my theoretical analysis to the limits of\nwhat is required for an intelligent presentation of the facts.\nThose who attempt to carry this interpretation farther than I\n\f60 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March, 1926\nhave done, do so at their own risk. If Spiritists see in my facts\na menace, it is not because of any theories to be found in my\npaper, but because my pellucid facts reveal to them, as in a\nmirror, certain fundamental weaknesses in their own position.\nIn conclusion, I do not feel called upon to ofEer \" an explanation\nof the means by which the subsconscious mind can create an\naudible and intelligent sound from space.\" In the case of Mrs.\nCooper I have no evidence even that the voices are produced\n\" from space \"\u2014whatever that may mean.

London : Kegan Paul,\nTrench, Trubner & Co., Ltd., 1925.\n2. Einfuhrung in den OkkuUismus und Spiritismus. By Eudolf\nTiscHNEE. 2\" Aufl. Pp. vi, 124. {Grenzfragen des Nerven- und\nSeelenlebens, Heft 109). Miinchen : J. F. Bergmann, 1923.\nAs interest in Psychical Research increases there arises a need for\nintroductions to the subject from the pens of reliable authorities.\nMr. Holms in his recently completed work on the facts of psychic\nscience has written a carefully documented survey of phenomena\nbelieved by spiritualists to be of an occult nature. As a work of\nreference to recorded instances of alleged supernormal phenomena\nin English and American literature the work is certainly of\nvalue, but its service to serious students of psychical research is\nof a different kind. For it is a striking example of what the\nstudy of occultism can do to the human mind. Mr. Holms\nbegan with a healthy disbelief in the everyday occurrence of\nsupernormal phenomena. But study of mediumistic records and\nthe practical experience of the seance room have influenced his\nmind to such an extent that for him the mysterious showmen of our\nmusic halls are no longer clever performers but powerful mediums,\nwho, for purposes of expediency, disguise their gifts. We were\naware that this view has been held in other quarters, especially in\nthe early days of spiritualism, but we confess to a feeling of\nmild surprise at finding it seriously advanced in a work of this\ncharacter. In order to understand this introduction to \" psychic\nscience \" the reader must always remember the attitude of its\n\fMarch, 1926 Reviews 51\nauthor. We cannot discover within its pages any criterion of\njudgment. If Mr. Holms goes to a music hall, sees a conjurer\nor performer whose methods he cannot understand, then that\nperson is a medium possessing psychic powers. If a Japanese\nmagician has his arms tied together and then receives solid hoops\nupon his arms, then he must be \" a singularly powerful medium,\"\npresenting \" a good instance of the passage of matter through\nmatter \" (p. 337). Obviously the same standard of criticism is\napplied to the work of the medium proper. How, for example,\ncan one explain the masks, beards, muslin, and phosphoric oil\nfound in connexion with Williams and Rita in 1878 ? Mr. Holms\nthinks it is very simple ;\nthey are either apports brought in by\nmalicious spirits, or the objects were introduced by the sitters to\ndiscredit spiritualism (p. 388). From this it will be seen how the\nphenomena of the seance room are treated by Mr. Holms, and\nhow the most painstaking historian that spiritualism has yet\nproduced has succeeded in his task. For, apart from the author's\nmental attitude, the book contains a readable survey of the\nhistory of spiritualistic inquiry, and in the accounts of the marvels\nof the past, the reader will do well to remember that their\nnarrators in many cases had (for all we know) precisely the same\nmental attitude as Mr. Holms. When that fact is thoroughly\ngrasped the student will realise how properly to appraise the\nstories he hears which emanate from spiritualistic sources.\nDr. Tischner in his brief survey of the whole field has provided\nGerman-speaking peoples with the most useful summary of psychical\nresearch which has hitherto appeared. He has selected his examples\nfrom a wide range of material, and even if certain of his specimens are\nopen to objection, it is as well for the student to realise that if no cases\nwere given except those the evidence for which was absolutely flawless\nthere would be few cases indeed left with which to deal. In his\ncriticism of the cases of clairvoyance he has wisely omitted the\nname of Bert Reese, who has been included by Mr. Holms, but\non the other hand he seems to accept the reliability of Dr.\nCrawford's observations, basing his belief apparently upon the\nimprobability of the observer being deceived for so long a period\nof time. It is to be hoped that Dr. Tischner will study the\nwork of Mr. Holms, as there he will discover an easy solution to\nhis difficulty, and incidentally solve other doubts concerning the\nprobability or improbability of certain minds being open to the\n\f52 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March, 1926\nmost barefaced deceptions without either suspecting or discovering\nit, and at the same time preserving an outward demeanour of critical\nacumen so wholly at variance with their mental outlook.\nB. J. D.\nNOTES ON PEEIODICALS.\nThe Journal of the A.S.P.R. for January has a translation of the\narticle by Prof. F. Cazzamalli which was published in the Revue\nMetapsychique in 1925 (pp. 215-233).\nMr. Price contributes a vivid account of some sittings at which\nhe was recently present with the medium Willy Schneider. The\nseances took place in the flat of the medium's father, in Braunau\nam Inn, and the circle included other members of the medium's\nfamily. Both telekinetic and teleplastic phenomena were observed,\nand in certain cases the alleged teleplastic structures were observed\nsupporting the various objects used at the sitting.

SOAL'S REPORT ON\nSITTINGS WITH MRS. COOPER.i\nI. A Letter prom Dr. Hereward Carrinqton.\nMr. S. G. Soal's Report on his sittings with Mrs. Blanche Cooper,\npublished in the Proceedings (Part 96), is to my mind one of the\nmost illuminating so far issued by the Society. It throws an\ninteresting light upon the possible mechanism of such communica-\ntions, and raises problems of a concrete nature which before had\nremained mere vague \" possibilities.\" Mr. Soal may certainly be\ncongratulated upon having obtained such valuable results. Un-\nfortunately, my own sittings with Mrs. C'ooper were extremely\nunsatisfactory,\u2014no clear evidence of any supernormal faculty\nhaving been obtained at any of them. But sitters may differ\nas well as mediiuns, and the mere fact that my own sittings with\nMrs. Piper, years ago, were also typically \" bad \" sittings (relatively\nspeaking), does not in the least alter the fact that many other\nindividuals have had \" good \" ones. In psychical research each\ncase and each investigation must stand alone and upon its own\nmerits ; and Mr. Soal's results are certainly extraordinary. Several\npoints of interest are raised by his paper, it seems to me, well\nworthy of special comment.\nIn the first j^lace, we have the \" Gordon Davis case, in which\na series of \" communications \" were received from a man who\n1 See Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXXV., p. 471 ff., Jom: S.P.R., Vol. XXIII., p. 29 if.\nA 2\n\f56 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April, 1926\nafterwards turns up alive and well. This instance is by no means\nunique. One recalls at once the case given by Flournoy, in his\nEsprits et Mediums,\u2014the case of Mme. Dupond. Here, a soi-\ndisant \" Rudolph \" communicates, and sends messages to those\nstill living, stating that he had actually died at 11 o'clock that\nmorning. He also turned up alive and well !\n^ Other instances of\na like nature could be quoted. Cases such as these bring home\nto us very clearly that, no matter how spiritistic in setting and\nappearance a certain set of communications may be, that fact\nin itself constitutes no guarantee of their authenticity, but that\nthe genuineness of the communications must be judged solely\nupon their supernormal content\u2014as Hodgson and Hyslop both\nacknowledged in their original Piper Reports.\nThe \" John Ferguson \" case, in which a number of communica-\ntions were received from an apparently fictitious personality,\nshows us to what an extent suggestion may act upon the mind\nof the medium and influence the results. Even the best mediums\nare capable of being similarly influenced ; once they get upon the\nwrong trail, this will be followed for a long time before the error\nis discovered by the sitter, the medium, or the trance personalities\nthemselves. Ready-to-hand instances of this are the Hall-Tanner\nsittings {Studies in Spiritism), and the case of Dean Bridgman\nConner,\u2014details of which are given by Mr. A. J. Philpott, in his\nbook upon the subject. William James was always insisting upon\nthis point : viz., that the mind of the entranced medium is\nparticularly susceptible to suggestion, and that \" what you put\ninto the mind you are very likely to get out of it.\" But he\ndid not by any means think that this fact eliminated super-\nnormal information being given, or even genuine spiritistic messages.\nHe only contended that this should make us doubly cautious in\naccepting them upon their face value. And I may point out, in\nthis connection, that this was also emphasised more than a\nhundred years ago by some of the early \" mesmerists.\" Deleuze,\ne.g. in his Animal Magnetism, replying to those who wished to\nquestion his subject upon points of practical advantage, said\n:\n\" You will gain nothing ;\nyou will even lose the advantages\nwhich you might have derived from his lucidity. It is very\npossible that you could make him speak upon all the subjects\n;JJ,^See my translation of this book, published in English under the title\nSpiritism and Psychology, pp. 72-82.\n\fApeil, 1926 A Further Discussion of Mr. SoaVs Report 57\nof your indiscreet curiosity ; but in that I have already\nwarned you, you will make him leave his own sphere and intro-\nduce him into yours. He will no longer have any other resources\nthan yourself. He will utter very eloquent discourses, but they\nwill no more be dictated by the internal inspirations. They will\nbe the product of his recollections or of his imagination ;\nperhaps\nyou will also rouse his vanity, and then all is lost ; he will not\nre-enter the circle from which he has wandered. . . . The two states\ncannot be confounded. . . These somnambulists are evidently\ninfluenced by the persons who surround them,\u2014by the circum-\nstances in which they are placed.\"\nA beautiful example of all this is to be found in Dr. van\nEeden's Report on his sittings with Mrs. Thompson, when he says\n:\n\" ... Being now well on my guard, I could, exactly in this\nmost interesting few minutes, detect, as it were, where the failures\ncrept in. I could follow the process and perceive when the\ngenuine phenomena stopped and unconscious play-acting began.\nIn hardly perceptible gradations the medium takes upon herself\nthe role of the spirit, completes the information, gives the required\nfinish and fills in the gaps by emendation and arrangement. . .\n\"\nAll this fits very well into James' theory that there are, in\nsuch communications, \" dips down,\" so to say, in which genuine\nsupernormal information is imparted, and that these bits of\ninformation are picked-up and elaborated by the medium's sub-\nconscious mind, and dramatised and woven into a mental complex,\n\u2014^just as external stimuli are picked-up and woven into a dream-\nnarrative by the dream-mind.\nMr. Soal remarks (p. 549), that \" it would even appear that a\npurely fictitious communicator like John Ferguson can sometimes\ngive supernormal information about facts unknown to the sitter. ...\"\nAn obvious example of this may be seen in the \" Dr. Phinuit\n\"\nof the early Piper regime. Another good example is \" Harrison\nClarke,\" who purported to communicate through Mrs. Smead,\nbut who seemed to be just as hazy and fictitious a character as\nDr. Phinuit. (See Hyslop's Report : Proceedings of the American\nS.P.R., Vol. 1.) Nevertheless, Harrison Clarke succeeded in\nobtaining a good deal of information about various sitters, and\nDr. Hyslop told me confidentially that he was rather sorry that\nhe had \" banished \" him, as the quality of the information obtained\ndepreciated very perceptibly thereafter !\n\fI\n58 journal of Society for Psychical Research Aphtl, 1926\nAs to the \"James Miles\" case, assuming tlie lionesty of the\nmedium, the most obvious conclusion to be drawn, it seems to\nme, is that Mrs. Cooper had unconsciously noted references to\nthis incident in the daily papers\u2014just as '\nMiss X.', in her oft-\nquoted case, mentally recorded the obituary notice of a friend\nof hers in the Times,\u2014without knowing that she had done so,\n\u2014\nand shortly afterwards saw this reproduced in the crystal ball.\n{Essays in Psychical Research, pp. 113-14.) But it is true, as\nMr. Soal points out, that certain details were also given, which\nturned out to be true, but which were not reported in the daily\npapers\u2014at least in London. These must be pigeon-holed for future\nreference.\nMr. Soal is of the opinion that a \" physical link \" of some sort\nbetween the sitter and the deceased person is often necessary\nin order to insure the best results (p. 479). It is hardly necessary\nto point out that Dr. Hodgson was also strongly of this opinion,\nand presented articles to the medium, whenever possible, which\nhad been worn or had been for long in the possession of the\nalleged communicator. He even issued special instructions to\nprospective sitters, telling them to wrap-up such articles in oil-\nsilk, and allow no one else to touch or handle them in any way.\nI myself still have two pencils which were used by Mrs. Piper,\nwhen sitting for Dr. Hodgson, which are still wrapped in this\nmanner. I may say that I have tested a number of mediums\nwith these pencils, since then, in order to see if any special\n\"influence\" were recognised. So far, however, these experiments\nhave been entirely negative in their results.\nThree main conclusions, it seems to me, may be drawn from\nMr. Soal's Report : (1) Supernormal information, sometimes of\nquite an extraordinary character, was obtained. (2) Communica-\ntions having all the ear-marks of genuine spiritistic messages may\nbe received, which are certainly not spiritistic in character.\n(3) We seem to have opened to our vision a vague and mysterious\nrealm, in which telepathy operates freely, quite unknown to the\npersons involved; and, in the words of Mr. Soal, \"the case for\nspontaneous telepathy between medium and sitter is far stronger\nthan the average psychical researcher usually admits. Indeed, it\nwould seem to be so extensive that in the present state of our\nknowledge we are not justified in putting any limits to it\"\n(p. 549). This is quite in keeping with Professor Richet's theory\n\fApril, 1926 A Further Discussion of Mr. SoaVs Report 59\nof Cryptsesthesia, and, I may add, with the theory which I myself\nadvanced nearly twenty-five years ago, when writing of the Piper\nphenomena. (See Proceedings, Vol. 17, pp. 337-59.) 1 then sug-\ngested that subconscious telepathic interaction might be far more\nextensive than is generally supjiosed. At all events, Mr. Soal's\nReport seems to me to be full of fascinating problems, no less\nthan it is a valuable record of actual occurrences, and I for one\nconsider it a distinct contribution to the literature of psychical\nresearch.\nReply by Mr. Soal.\nI would like to offer one or two suggestions with regard to Mr.\nHereward Carrington's kind appreciation of my paper in Proceedings.\nMr. Carrington mentions the case of \" Rudolph \" given in Prof.\nFlournoy's - book Esprits et Mediums. Now it seems to me that\nthis case differs essentially from my \" Gordon Davis \" case in one\nimportant respect. If my memory is correct all that was given\nby the soi-dtsaw^ \" Rudolph\n\"\n\" might well have been the product of\nMme. Dupond's own imagination. No knowledge was shown that\nwas definitely supernormal as happened in the case of Gordon\nDavis. A remarkable feature of the \" Davis \" sittings would\nappear to be the strong resemblance which they bear to the\nordinary cases of \" spirit communication from people who are\nknown to be deceased. Had \" Davis \" turned out to be really\ndead the communications would, I believe, have been accepted by\nmany people as fairly good evidence for his continued survival.\nIn the case of \" Rudolph \" there does not appear to be any real\nevidence of identity beyond what could have been derived from\nthe mind of Mme. Dupond who herself wrote the messages.\nI quite agree with Mr. Carrington's interpretation of the case of\nJames Miles, but perhaps it is worth while pointing out that the\nonly two details that were definitely coAct and that were not\ngiven in the London papers, were not fTO:;t;hjcoming at the sitting\nuntil I had read them in the Bath papersr. It is possible, there-\nfore, that my own mind may have been the, source of these two\nitems. The references to \" insurance money \" and a \" gate near\nthe boy's home \" are, I consider, too vague to be taken into\naccount.\nII. A Letter from Miss H. A. Dallas.\nFebruary 2, 1926.\nWill Mr. Soal kindly assist us in our study of his interesting\n\f60 Journal of Society jor Psychical Research April, 1926\ndocument, published in Proceedings, by telling us whether (1) he\nhad recently been thinking of \" Gordon Davis before the sitting\nwith Mrs. Cooper, Jan. 4, 1922 ; and (2), whether the voice which\nseemed \" quite familiar \" to him made him think of \" Gordon\nDavis \" before he asked \" Who are you ?\n\"\nH. A. Dallas.\nReply by Mr. Soal.\nFebruary 6, 1926.\nIn reply to the points raised by Miss H. A. Dallas I had not\nto the best of my knowledge been thinking of Gordon Davis\nbefore the sitting. Had I thought of him even a few days previous\nto the sitting on Jan. 4 I should have made a note of it at the\ntime, and the fact that I did not make any such note makes\nit highly improbable that he had entered my mind before the\nsitting.\nI undoubtedly thought of him occasionally during the summer\nand autumn of 1920 just after I had received the false news of\nhis death, and I have a distinct recollection that more than once\nI felt extremely sorry for him.\nIn reply to Miss Dallas' other question I am certain I did not\nactually think of Gordon Davis until he gave his name. I had\nmerely an impression that the voice was one that I ought to\nknow quite well. But when I heard the name there flashed\ninto my mind an overpowering recollection of the conversation in\nthe train. The peculiar intonation of the \" voice \"\nvividly recalled\nthe rather affected accent that I had noticed in the train, and\nwhich I had slightly resented at the time. The impression I had\nof Mr. Davis when I met him as a cadet was that he had\ncultivated a peculiar kind of intonation whereby all our natural\nvowel sounds are slightly falsified\u2014an accent that is very charac-\nteristic of a certain class of army officer. I felt in fact that\nMr. Davis was trying rather to impress me and that he could\nif he wished revert to a more homely type of speech. In this\nopinion which I formed in 1916 I am confirmed by my subsequent\nintercourse with Mr. Davis. There is I think no doubt that\nMr. Davis had assimilated a certain accent in accordance with the\nparticular type of men with whom he was associated at the time.\nIt was this accent more than anything else\u2014together with some\nindefinable resemblance in the actual voices\u2014^that made me exclaim,\n' By Jove and it's like Gordon Davis too !\n\"\n\fApril, 1926 A Further Discussion of Mr. Seal's Report 61\nIII. A Further Statement by Mr. Soal.\nIn order to guard against possibilities of overstatement I wish\nto substitute for the estimates given on p. 43 of the Journal for\nMarch (Vol. 23), in my reply to Mr. H. Dennis Bradley, the follow-\ning reduced figures. It will be seen that these revised estimates\nmake not the slightest material difference to my argument. The\ncorrected argument should read :\nCalculations based on a study of several County directories\nenable me to assert that not one person in 100 will have among\nhis acquaintances anyone of the name of Gordon Davis (or Davis\nGordon). Examination of a particular large town like Southend-\non-Sea makes it probable that on the average not one in 500\nhouses in Great Britain would have anything that could be even\nremotely described as \" a funny dark tunnel.\" The chance,\ntherefore, of the simultaneous coincidence of these two events is\nunderstated at 1\/50,000.\nAgain, I think I am quite safe in saying that not one in 50 houses\nin Great Britain will be fronted by anything that resembles a\nverandah as much as the little sea-side shelter that stands in front\nof the Southend house.\nIt is not easy to estimate the chance that a given house should\ncontain a piano, with a bird of any description standing on it, but\nI feel certain that this chance would be understated at one house\nin every 20.\nHence the denominator of the fraction that denotes the chance\nof coincidence of these four simultaneous events is, 50,000 x 1000 =\n50 X 10^, i.e. several times the total number of inhabited houses in\nGreat Britain [taking this number as 8-5 x 10\u00ae].\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nConcerning Errors of Transmission in Trance-Communication.\nTo the Editor of The Journal or the S.P.R.\nMadam,\u2014Your correspondent, B. G. Bouwens {Journal, Jan. 1926),^\nstates one of the problems of trance communication. He says,\n^ \" Errors obviously due to mishearing of the English language\noccur fairly frequently in communications. Since the transmission\nof the message, at least at the source, is supposed to be inde-\niSee also S.P.E. Jour., Vol. XXII., pp. 94 and 12(j.\n\f62 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April, 1926\npendent of spoken sound, how is this to be explained ?\n\" May\nI offer some observations based upon a study of Mrs. Leonard's\nsittings ?\nAccording to their method of delivery the communications can\nbe classified thus :\n(1) Those transmitted through the medium's lips by Feda, Mrs.\nLeonard's control.\n(2) Those spoken through the medium's lips by the communicator\nwhen in direct control, and without assistance from Feda.\n(3) Those given in the \" direct voice,\" apparently that of my\ncommunicator. These are rarely more than brief sentences, and\nseem to originate at a spot somewhere in front of the medium's\nface. I do not think I am mistaken in assuming that this is\nactually the direct voice. It is not to be confused with \" dupli-\ncations \" which may be described thus,\u2014During Feda's controlling\nI frequently get long passages given a few words at a time. First,\nthese few words are heard spoken by the medium's lips in a\nclear whisper, and then they are repeated in the ordinary Feda\nvoice. The long messages given in this way are always most\ncarefully phrased and accurate in pronunciation, strikingly different\nfrom the Feda talk. Feda meanwhile gives no token of being\naware that I hear these whispers, but always most carefully\nrepeats them to me. I think these whispers result from Feda\nmentally repeating to herself the words she \" hears,\" before she\ndesignedly transmits them to me.\nClass (1) has three sub-divisions,\n\u2014\n(a) Messages in which Feda gives verbatim the words of the\ncommunicator. During reception of these she pauses to \" listen,\"\nand repeats only a few words at a time. This is easily the best\nmethod ;\nproper names sometimes come through with accuracy,\nat other times they may be correct as to the first portion of a\nname. There is every indication that Feda, meanwhile, is in the\nposition of a person listening to spoken words.\n(&) Messages received when Feda cannot \" hear \" what the\ncommunicator is \" saying,\" or cannot hear with ease and accuracy.\nFeda then falls back upon a diiferent method, that of \" sensing\n\"\nthe communicator's thought and expressing it in her own words.\n(c) Ideas expressed in picture form. Feda will say that the\ncommunicator is \" showing her,\" or that he is \" building up for\nFeda to see,\" and then follows the description of a scene, picture,\n\fApril, 1926 Correspondence 63\nor symbol. Sometimes there is an appeal for this pictoria\nmethod, as when she says, \" Feda cannot get that. Show it to\nFeda.\"\nThe difference in phraseology between the messages (a) and (h)\nis most striking. With the former I get the perfectly worded\nsentences so characteristic of my communicator in his earth-life.\nOften they appear to be rather beyond Feda's comprehension.\nWhile Feda is thus \" hearing \" clearly there is never any obscurity\nin the contents of the messages. When, on the contrary, she is\n\" sensing,\" there are frequent omissions in the chain of thought,\nand the form of expression is sometimes rather vague. Feda\nadmits that, while sensing, she usually leaves out portions of what\nis given her to transmit, although doing her best to get through\nas much as possible. Feda's own forms of expression, and the\nEnglish in which they are given, contain many inaccuracies.\nI think we must regard these sub-divisions (a), (6), (c), as\nindicating variations in the form taken by the communicator's\nthought when it emerges in Feda's consciousness. His thoughts,\nreaching her from an external source, emerge as sound, as aware-\nness, or as sight. When the conditions are at their best she seems\nto herself to be actually hearing; but when conditions deteriorate\nshe is aware only of a general impression of what is in the com-\nmunicator's mind ; while at other times his ideas are received in\nthe form of pictures which she more or less clearly visualises.\nFeda asserts that she cannot easily concentrate on two reception\nmethods at once; if she wishes to hear, it is necessary to ignore\nseeing and sensing meanwhile. To some extent she is able to\ndecide which method to use ; her will plays some part.\nBut whichever method is used \" the transmission of the message,\"\nas your correspondent says, \" is supposed to be independent of\nspoken sound.\" I think it is undoubtedly independent. When\nFeda speaks of hearing she is describing how the message appears\nto her consciousness at the moment of its reception. I have reason\nto think that she is aware that whether she hears, feels or sees,\nthe origin in each case is actually a thought, and thought only.\nThe above outline requires, for its completion, illustrations of\nthe different classes of message, together with explanations of the\nmodus operandi as given by communicators, and by Feda, in reply\nto the sitter's questions. But this would expand my letter into\nan article of serious length.\n\f64 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April, I92e\nIt would, however, be misleading to leave the above sketch\nas it stands ; for there is one all-important factor which has not\nbeen mentioned. The understanding of this factor would go far\nto explain why it is that the ideal method of quoting the com-\nmunicator word for word is not employed throughout the sitting.\nI refer to that elusive something which Feda terms \" the power.\"\nIt is, we are told, when \" the power is failing \" that the sitting\ncomes to an abrupt end. When Feda says, \" there is plenty of\npower,\" the best results are obtained.\nWhat is this \" power \" ? Illustrations of its apparent influence\nupon clarity of expression, the ability to transmit names, and\nupon the memory of the control, would call for extended treat-\nment. It would also be necessary to quote the communicator's\nspontaneous remarks about the relation of the power to good\nconditions, and his replies to my questions about the nature of\nthe power itself.\nI am studying this elusive factor. If there exists any record\nof experiment or discussion bearing upon it, I should be glad of\ninformation ; for up to the present I have failed to discover\nanything beyond mere references to \" the light,\" or \" the power,\"\nscattered here and there in records of sittings. My provisional\nconclusions may be summarised as follows :\nMediums provide an invisible, intangible emanation which is the\nindispensable prerequisite for psychical phenomena of any kind\nwhatsoever. In mental mediumship this emanation is in a highly\nattenuated condition, and it surrounds medium and control,\nsitter and communicator. It would seem that this emanation\nuniquely affects both the control and the medium's brain, rendering\nthem highly sensitive to thought. It is said to be attracted\ntowards centres of mental activity. During a sitting, therefore, it\nshould be chiefly collected around the medium and around the\ncommunicator ; but if the sitter permits his thought to become\ntoo intense he unwittingly draws around himself so much of this\nemanation that it forms a third centre, and confusion in trans-\nmission inevitably results.\nDuring a control sitting this emanation is in continual but\nirregular motion, like wind on gusty days. The receptivity of\nthe control, therefore, varies accordingly. In consequence of this\nflow and ebb, a degree of accuracy in reception is possible during\none period of a sitting which becomes impossible at another period.\nMy communicator breaks off from a subject when he becomes\naware that Feda is in difficulties with its transmission, and he\nendeavours to revert to it later, should conditions improve.\nThis has a bearing upon the difficulty with names ; I have noticed\noccasionally that names which failed to be given at a first attempt\nwere put through quite easily a few minutes later.\nG.

Apparition of a Cat.\nWe print below a case in which a house would appear to have\nbeen haunted by the apparition of a cat. It is important to\nnote that the three percipients concerned saw the \" ghost-cat\n\"\nindependently, that is to say, none of them had any conscious\nknowledge at the time of the experience that the house was\nsupposed to be haunted, or that any other inmate had seen\nthis cat.\nThe names and addresses of the persons concerned are known\nto the Society, but pseudonyms are used here. The case was\nsent to us originally by Mr. A. W. Trethewy, a Member of\nthe Society, to whom Mr. and Mrs. Simpson (pseudonym) are\nknown personally, and who has himself stayed in the house in\nquestion.\nOn June 16, 1925, Mr. Trethewy wrote to the Secretary,\nMiss Newton, as follows\nHere are some papers about a house haunted by a cat, which\nmay deserve a place among your records. I have made an en-\nquiry myself and trust that my notes cover every point of imjoor-\ntance on which the letters did not give full information.\nA. W. Trethewy.\nWith this letter Mr. Trethewy enclosed the following note :\n\u2014\n... I stopped at W for one night this month with the\n[Sini'psons'] and my marginal notes on the attached papers are\nbased on the enquiries which I then made. I have no doubt\nthat they gave me correct information to the best of their ability.\nThey seem to be intelligent and accurate observers. I accept their\nstatements as true. I did not see the ghost cat myself. Mr.\nand Mrs. {Simpson] were both clairvoyant in the past, she used\nthe crystal and he had the gift of travelling clairvoyance \"\n;\nneither of them uses the power now, they gave up the practice\nyears ago owing to unfortunate experiences. Miss [Allen] (pseu-\ndonym) probably has psychic powers too ...\nA. W. Trethewy.\n\fMat, 1926 Case 67\nMr. Simpsons original statement concerning the cat ran as\nfollows :\n\u2014\n20th Feb. 1925.\nWith reference to the ghost cat we have seen in this house\n\u2014\nneither my wife nor I have ever heard anyone say that this house\nis supposed to be haunted. The house was built, I should think,\nat the end of the MOO, or early 1500. Fifteen years ago\u2014it was an\ninn, before that a farm house. \" The Bogie Cat \" has been seen\nseveral times by my wife and myself, also by our friend Miss\n[Allen^ when she was staying with us\u2014but it has never been seen\nby any two of us at the same time. We all agree it is a long-\nhaired cat, practically black. Miss [Allen] has seen it both in\nthe house and garden\u2014my wife and I saw it only in the house.\nEach of us have seen it in several different places. My wife and\nI have never seen it walking towards us\u2014only by our sides\u2014\n\u2022\nacross or away, never coming to meet us. When I have seen it,\nit always has its tail up on end, anyway, by the time I have\ndecided I am looking at \"Bogie,\" not at one of our own two\ncats\u2014which are smaller and lighter in colour. I never used to\nbelieve in ghosts and always said when they were mentioned,\n\" Show me something which will stand up to a shot gun, and I\nwill believe I've seen a ghost.\"\nThe first time I saw Bogie, I was in the dining-room and\nthought I saw a cat trying to get into our dresser cupboard (our\ncats will get into it, if the doors are left open). It was some\nnine feet from me\u2014I walked over to it and bent down to push\nthe cat away\u2014I then noticed I could see right through it. The\ncat was going away, so I thought I would follow it and I did so,\nthrough the dining room door, which was open, across a little\nlobby, then through the scullery into the pantry. In the middle\nof the pantry floor it vanished. I immediately went into the\nkitchen and saw our two cats asleep on a chair. The doors were\nall open. I should like to say that at a few feet away it looked\nlike any common cat, but when I was close to it, I knew it\nwould be useless to try to touch it as I could see right through\nit. Both my wife and I saw it several times before we mentioned\nit to each other. We never mentioned \" Bogie \" to Miss [Allen]\ntill she said, \"I see a cat about your place, which vanishes\u2014it\ncannot belong to you.\"\nThe last time I saw Bogie \" was about a month ago\u2014I went\nA -2\n\f68 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Mat, 192(}\nto the front door to get the letters by evening post and said to\nthe postman, \" Bother, I've let the cat out.\" He remarked, \" No\ncat came out, Sir.\" I took the letters to my wife and said, \" I\nhave just seen Bogie again.\" C. J. [SIMPSON\\\nWith this statement Mr. Trethewy enclosed the following\nletter from Mr. Simjjson, to which he appended the marginal\nnotes referred to above. These notes are printed at the end\nof Mr. Simpson's letter.\n8th May, 1925.\nIn your letter of March 10, you asked me to answer the follow-\ning questions about the ghost cat seen in, and about this house.\nBefore receiving your letter I had not made any notes on the\nsubject. Here are your questions :\n(1) Approximate date ?\nWe came to this house March 1, 1924 ; from then till March 10,\n1925, my wife and I saw the cat, each several different times.\nNote in my diary April 4, 1925, at 8.48 p.m. \" Elsie (my wife)\nwhen coming out of the bedroom saw the ghost cat at the top of\nthe stairs sitting still, it passed her (Note 1, see below), and went\non down the stairs.\n(2) Time of day ?\nI have seen Miss [Allen] since I received your letter, and she\ntold me she had seen it in the garden in daylight.\n(3) Have dogs and cats seen the ghost ?\nWe have a bull terrier and two cats, but I have never noticed\nanything in their behaviour to make me think they have seen the\nghost cat (Note 2, below).\n(4) Has your servant seen it ?\nNo (Note 3, below).\n(5) Has anybody seen it besides you, your wife and Miss [Allen]?\nNo, we have had other jDeople stopjDing with us who have said\nthey wished they could see it, but they have not done so.\n(6) Has it been seen by one person but not by another who was\npresent who woidd have seen it if it had been a live cat ?\nYes, I went to the front door after dark to take the letters\nfrom the postman, saw the cat pass me and run out to the gate,\nsome 24 feet ; I remarked to the postman, \" I have let the cat\nout,\" he answered, \" No cat came out. Sir.\" I went to my wife,\ngave her the letters immediately, and found both our cats asleep\nin front of the fire in the room with her (Note 4, below).\n\fMat, 1926 Case 69\n(7) Remarks as to the circumstances of apparition a^id any other\npoint worthy of mention.\nMy idea is that other people, when in this house, may have\nseen Bogie, but not known it was a ghost, simply on what I have\nnoted, this : That at, say, 9 feet or more it looks an ordinary\ncat, but when quite close to it you see through it. Miss [Allen]\nsaid, when she saw it, she knew she was not looking at an ordin-\nary cat, because it vanished (Note 5, below).\nMiss [Allen] was here during the summer of 1924. She told us\nshe once felt it under her feet, looked down, but could not see\nanything (Note 6, below).\nOnce since then, when I was coming down stairs in the dusk,\nI thought that when I was at the top stair, there was a cat some\nstairs down ; I walked on down the stairs, saw no cat, where I\nhad seen one, but I felt my foot kick against something that\nmoved, when I got to the stair where I had seen it, when I was\non the landing (Note 7, below).\nWhen Miss [Allen] said she must have felt Bogie, I laughed at\nher. Because my idea was that Bogie was as it were a mirage,\nseen but not to be felt, because it was without dimension ! Some\ntime after, I myself thought I felt it, may be, because I thought\nI saw a cat on a certain stair, on getting to that stair, I thought\nI felt it ! \"When my foot got to that stair, I looked down at\nthe stair but could see no cat ! At the time I was certain\nneither of our cats were anywhere near the stairs.\nNotes by Mr. Trethewy.\n(1) Sideways, not facing her.\n(2) No dog or cat has been present, when the ghost cat has\nappeared, but a bull terrier has once or twice apj)eared frightened\nat night, looking at something invisible.\n(3) She has never mentioned it, but has not been questioned.\n(4) It was 5.30 on a winter's evening, so, if it had been a real\ncat, it might have escaped the postman's notice.\n(5) Mr. Simpson has never seen it in broad daylight, but his\nwife and Miss A. have done so.\n(6) She may have fancied this feeling, but it may have been an\nobjective sensation. I did not see her, and can only judge from\nthe Simpsons account of what she said.\n\f'70 Journal of Society for Psychical Research mat, 1926\n(7) He was not feeling with liis foot for it, but had put his foot\nforward confidently, as he thought the cat had gone.\n(8) All the people who have seen it describe it similarly as\niarser and darker than the house cats and with tail erect. No-\nbody has ever seen it coming towards him or her. Its eyes have\nnever been seen because its face has never been turned towards\nthe spectator.\nThe [Simi^sons] are trying to sell the house, because it does not\nsuit them, not on account of the ghost cat, so they have not\ntalked to the villagers about the apparition for fear that the house\nmay be considered to be haunted and, therefore, may become\ndifficult to sell.\nThe ghost cat is not like any cat which they have ever owned\nand there is no story to connect it with the house ;\ntheir prede-\ncessors in the occupation of the house never mentioned it to them.\nSo far as they know nobody knows anything about it except\nthemselves and the friends whom they have told. It has never\nbeen seen in the bedrooms or drawing-room ; when seen, it gener-\nally walks towards the scullery or pantry. There is no object\napparent in its manifestations ; it seems to be quite happy.\nA. W. T.\nMr. Trethewy also sent us the following letter addressed to\nhim by Mrs. Simpson\n:\n\u2014\nMay 21th, 1925.\nI was most interested to hear of your friend's ghost kittea.\nThe cat we see here is not like any cat my husband or I have\never had. I have seen it again in daylight in the kitchen since\nyou were here, and I feel sure its interest is in the house and not\nElsie [SIMPSON].\nThe following account of her experiences was also obtained\nfrom Miss Allen :\n\u2014\nWhile staying at the above address [address not given here]\nlast May I saw the jDhantom cat twice.\nMy friends Mr. and Mrs. [Simpson] had told me nothing about\nit, so I was not in the least expecting to see anyt.hing of the sort.\nI saw it twice in one day, first soon after breakfast while in\nthe garden near the backdoor, close to some gooseberry bushes.\nI reaUsed that it was not one of my friends' cats, the colouring\n\fMat, 1926 Case 71\nwas different. I did not see it very distinctly\u2014it was going\naway from me\u2014and I somehow felt there was something funny\nabout it. Shortly afterwards I was in the larder, the door of\nwhich was open, leading into the back kitchen, again I saw the\nsame dark-coloured cat, walking past the open door, its tail erect\nas before. Again I realised that there was something queer about\nit, and seeing Mrs. [Simpson] I said to her, \" I don't know what\nis the matter with me this morning, but I am seeing cats !\n\"\nI then explained, and she informed me that I had seen the\nphantom cat. [ALLE'N}.\nTo this letter Mrs. Simpson has appended the following\nnote :\n\u2014\nKeceived from Miss [Alleyi] June 24, 1925. Miss {Alleii] was\nhere May, 1924, not, as she says. May, 1925. C. [SIMPSON].\nAnother case in which the apparition of a cat was seen was\nprinted in the Journal, Vol. XV. p. 249-254. In that case the\nhallucination was collective and the cat was recognised as one\nwhich had formerly lived in the house.\nTHE CASES OF MR. MOSS AND MR. IVIUNNINGS.\nThe two following cases are here discussed, not only to provide\nMembers of the Society with information which they ought to\npossess, but also to illustrate how easy it is at the present\ntime for fraudulent mediums to find material for the purposes\nof their trade.\nThe Society first received information concerning Mr. George\nMoss in May, 1924. He appears to have been a chauffeur\nin a northern town, and professed to obtain \" extras \" upon\nphotographic plates which he could not explain. His employer\nbegan to make inquiries, was easily convinced, and the fame\nof the new medium began to spread. In April, 1925, he left\nhis employment and was placed on the regular staff of the\nBritish College of Psychic Science, Ltd. The following note\nappeared in Light on '4th April, 1925. \"Mr. George H. Moss\nis now on the regular staff of the College, for psychic photo-\ngraphy. His work, which has been closely watched, and\nexperimented with for the past year, is '^excellent, and the\n\f72 Journal of Society for Psychical Research ^niat, 1926\nCollege has every confidence in recommending it to those\ninterested in, or requiring, the comfort of this particular psychic\nmanifestation.\"\nA further note appeared on 16th May of the same year,\npraising Mr. Moss and the remarkable clearness of some of\nthe \" extras,\" and remarking that \" the variety and curious\nconformations of the surrounding ectoplasm \" made his work\na very valuable addition to that of the other mediums.\nA fuller account of the medium's activities were published\nin the Transactions of the College for April, 1925. Mrs.\nM'Kenzie discussed the evidential results, and showed exam23les\nof the recognitions attained by sitters, apparently unknown to\nthe medium. In the same issue the Principal of the College\npublished a long and carefully recorded series of experiments\nwith Moss, illustrating the effect of mediumistic energy upon\nthe sensitive emulsion of photographic plates. These experi-\nments (which had no scientific value) were made because Moss\nhad found it necessary to have the plates used at the sittings\nin his possession for some time previously. The reason alleged\nfor this proceeding was that it was found that the plates had\nto be \" magnetised,\" and Mr. M'Kenzie's experiments showed\nthat the plates which had been in the medium's possession\nbehaved differently on development from what normal un-\ntreated plates were expected to do.\nIn Jime, 1925, Mr. Moss went to Birmingham, and there an\nunfortunate incident occurred. Mr. Fred Barlow (late Hon.\nSecretary of the Society for the Study of Supernormal Pictures)\nwas examining some of the plates used at the sittings which\nbore \" extras,\" when he noticed that all these had one edge\nroughened whilst the negatives bearing no \" psychic \" marldngs\nwere all smooth. This excited his suspicions, and subsequent\nexamination showed similar markings (hitherto unnoticed) on all\nthe College plates which bore extras. Mr. Moss had certainly\nbeen very careless, and his method was clear. The \" magneti-\nzation \" was merely an excuse for ojDening the packets of\nplates and impressing the fraudulent \" extras,\" the correct\npositions of which were assured by fiUng one edge of the\nplate, so that in inserting it in the slide the spirit should not\nbe found standing on its head.\n\fMay, 1926 The Gases of Mr. Moss and Mr. Munnings 73\nMoss was cliallenged on these points, but signed a paper\ndenying that he opened the packets. When confronted with\niurther evidence, he confessed to the wholesale imposition, and\nwas dismissed from his employment.\nThe second case, which furnishes us with a curious history\nof mediumistic activity, is that of the trumpet medium,\nFrederick Tansley Munnings. This person first seems to have\nattracted public notice in 1919, when a letter appeared in\nLight (7th June, 1919, p. 181) describing a seance with\nMunnings in London, at wliich the trumpet was plainly seen\nfloating in the centre of the circle, and at which a full-form\nmaterialised figure shook hands with some of the sitters.\n'This letter aroused protests from certain persons who had been\npresent at Munnings' sittings, and who believed the phenomena\n\"were entirely fraudulent. No definite action seems, however, to\nhave been taken, and in 1921 Mr. Munnings, now \" Mr.\nGaulton,\" gave sittings at the Stead Bureau apparently under\nthe auspices of the Guild of Spiritual Unity. Spirits purporting\nto be Sir WilUam Crookes, BiUie Carleton, and Dan Leno\nkindly commim.icated, and the result seems to have perturbed\nthe members of the Guild, since some \" test \" sittings were\nproposed to Mr. Munnings, alias Gaulton.\nThese seances took place, and the results did not satisfy the\nCommittee of the Guild, Avhose verdict aroused a lively con-\ntroversy. Glowing accounts were published as to the marvels\nto be observed at Munnings' sittings, and other evidence was\noffered pointing to the normal explanation of these remarkable\nphenomena. Rubber gloves had been foimd secreted on\nMunnings' person, and the \" spirit scents \" apparently proceeded\nfrom a rag which was accidently dropped by the medium, and\nwas subsequently found by the sitters after the performance.\nThe President of the Hastings and St. Leonard's Christian\nSpirituahsts' Society then published \" two photographs of Mr.\nMunnings, etc., taken during a test seance ^ by the kind\npermission of his guide \" (Light, 1921, p. 384). These photo-\ngraphs showed \" ectoplasm \" proceeding from Mimnings, and in\none case a \" plasmic rod \" is supporting the trumpet.\n^ There were no test conditions of any kind at this sitting. (See Light,\n1921, p. 401.)\n\f74 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May, 1925-\nThe result of these inquiries was to discredit Muimings, and\nalthough the sj^iritualistic press still maintained that he had\n\" the gift,\" yet the quality of his mediumship was such that\n\" right-minded spiritualists were warned against him \" {Light,\n1921, p. 417). In 1922, however, he was stiU giving seances\nuntil apparently he found more lucrative employment, which\nended disastrously before the Surrey Quarter Sessions on 2nd\nJanuary, 1923, when he was sentenced to nine months with,\nhard labour for burglary on 25th October and 28th November,\n1922. Very soon after Munnings came out of prison, he went\nback to spiritualism. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, discussing\nMunnings with the journahst Mr. Moseley {John Bull), who was\nto have sittings, wrote that \" these things are on a low plane,\nbut I believe the man is a very strong physical mediixm.\" ^\nMr. Moseley was not impressed by the performance, and\nwrote an unfavourable account of his impressions. This\npublicity, however, was building up a fresh clientele for\nMunnings, and on 28th June, 1924, Light appeared with the\nheadline on the cover, \" Broadcasting Spirit Voices.\" This\nexperiment was devised by Mr. R. H. Saunders, who wished\nto \" broadcast the direct voices of spirits, in bright light.\"\n\" Sir William Crookes \" and \" Sir William Preece \" volunteered\ntheir hearty co-operation {Light, 1924, p. 403), and about\n250 persons were present on 24th July, 1924, for the demon-\nstration. The name of the medium had apparently been\nsuppressed until the end of the meeting, and then some must\nhave been surprised to find it was Munnings, \" one of the\nstrongest voice mediums we have,\" according to Mr. Saunders.\nThis advertisement brought many clients to Mr. Munnings, and\nwe find Mr. Dennis Bradley devoting Chapter XIV. of The\nWisdom of the Gods to the same medium. His conclusion was\nthat \" F. T. Munnings is a very powerful voice medium\n\"\n(p. 141), although \" there was an absolute scarcity of actual\nevidence and of personal identity \"\n(p. 140).\nIn March, 1926, Mr. Munnings was still giving sittings.\nBut unluckily for him, owing to a burnt-out fuse, which con-\nfused a sitter as to whether a switch was on or off, the light\nwent up in the middle of a seance and revealed Mr. Munnings\n1 S. Moseley, The llysterious Medium, London (1924), p. 81.\n\fMat, 1926 Notes on Periodicals 75\nwith an extension device for the trumpet and an angle piece\nto his mouth. This proved too much, and Dr. Wallace, Sir\nA. C. Doyle, Mr. Bradley and Mr. Saunders wrote a joint\nletter to Light (13th March, 1926, p. 125) warning the public,\nalthough they stated that they knew \" of cases where the\npsychic result has been beyond suspicion.\"\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nThe Revue Metapsychique for January-February has a long appeal\nfrom the Committee relative to the projects and aims la the\nresearch work of the Institute in Paris. Prof. Richet contributes\nan article on the alleged cryptesthesia of the subject Schermann,\nas related in the book by Prof. Fischer of Prague in 1924.^\nProf. Richet thinks that the cryptesthesia of Schermann is esta-\nblished in an irreproachable manner, and in the same number of\nthe Revue M. Sudre reviews Prof. Fischer's book in some detail.\nDr. Osty, in the same issue, has a lengthy and interesting accoimt\nof M. Pascal Forthuny's [Georges Cochet] public seances for\nclairvoyant descriptions, which can be compared with those which\nhave become so familiar with English mediums.\nThe Journal of the A.S.P.R. for February has a further dis-\ncussion of the alleged supernormal faculties of M. Forthuny from\nthe pen of M. Rene Sudre, and Mr. Bird has a note upon the\nCazzamalli experiments, giving the opinion of Alexandro Tosi that\nthe results are valueless. In his criticism of Tosi Mr. Bird neatly\nsums up the controversy, but we can hardly assent to his judg-\nment that unless independent experiments give negative results\n\\ Cazzamalli's results must be tentatively accepted.\nIn the same issue Mr. Price narrates a story of a poltergeist\nwhich was apparently at work nearly thirty years ago, and also\n' an account of a case dealing with what is termed \" Pseudo-psychic\nmanifestations due to self-induced hysteria.\" The case is of little\nimportance to psychical researchers, and the attitude of the\nsubject herself renders any successful treatment difficidt to initiatei\nThe issue of the same Journal for March has an article by\nM. Sudre on the Role of Prosopopoiesis ^ in Psychical Research, in\nExperimente mit Raphael Schermann. .. . (Berlin u. Wien, 1924.) Cf.\nDr. W. Prince's note on this subject in the Jo!;?-\u00abaZ ,- A.S.P.R., 1924, xviii\npp. 537-561.\n^ Prosopopoiesis is M. Sudre's name for changes of personality.\n\f76 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May, 1926\nwiiicli lie emphasises the points raised in his recently published\nIntroduction a la Metapsychique Humaine, which compel him to\nstate that \" the analysis of messages from the dead prevents\nabsolutely our believing their alleged origin.\"\nMr. Price, in the same number, contributes a characteristic\naccount of a sitting with the slate-writing medium, Mrs. Laura A.\nPruden, of Cincinnati. The record is valuable, as it illustrates\nforcibly the chaotic condition of certain branches of psychical\nresearcli, and the ease with which any person claiming super-\nnormal powers may attract attention, and reap much material\nbenefit as w^ell. The writer tells us that Mrs. Pruden was induced\nto come to England to exhibit her powers to \"a few of the\nleading psychists \" in the \" Old Country,\" amongst Avhom he\nmentions Sir A. C. Doyle, Mr. Hewat M'Kenzie and Mr. Swaffer.\nThis medium appears to i^ossess so great a contempt for her\nsitters that she expects them to submit to conditions, which, if\nMr. Price had not described them, we would have believed im-\npossible. She sits alo7ie and uncontrolled at one end of a table,\nthe legs of which are swathed with cloth material down to the\nfloor excejjt on her side. She sits back to the light, and her\narms, legs and feet are entirely invisible to the sitters. She holds\nthe slates under the table, presumably with both hands (Mr.\nPrice does not tell us), and the \" phenomenon \" consists of\nmessages on the slates and \" answers \" to questions written by\nthe sitters on billets placed under the table. Mr. Price concludes\nthat \" it would be unfair to pass an opinion as to the abnormality\nor otherwise of the phenomena \" that were produced.^\nThe same issue contains an interesting survey of the early days\nof the Schneider mediumship by Commander Kogelnik of Braunau\nam Inn, who has been in touch with the family for some years.\nIn his observations on Kogelnik'sj article, Mr. J. M. Bird tries to\n^ The psychological effects of this medium and her performances upon her sitters\nseems to be peculiar. For in the sitting described above the \" phenomena \"\neither were due to the most arrant fraud or were supernormal. To describe\nmessages produced without the aid of human hands as \" abnormally\n\"\nproduced is an expression difficult to understand. Similarly, her exhibitions\nin America aroused great astonishment. Sir A. C. Doyle described her as\ncertainly one of the great mediums of the world (Our Second American\nAdventure, p. 44) ; and Mr. Bird declared that if she is a fraud, then there\nis absolutely no sense in believing an3rthing creditable about any member of\nthe human race (J. M. Bird, My Psychic Adventures, London, 1924, p. 280).\n\fMat, 1926 Notes on Periodicals 77\nlink up the incipient stages of the Schneider mediumship with\nthose in other mediumships, and finds points of parallelism with\nthem. In particular he discusses certain aspects of the Margery\nmediumship, but he appears to forget that similarity in pheno-\nmena is by no means evidence for their supernormal character,\nand often rather the reverse. Similarly the importance that he\nattaches to \" clairvoyant descriptions \" during sittings for physical\nphenomena appears inexplicable, unless we assume that he pos-\nsesses good evidence that such descriptions are, in one sense at\nleast, ' veridical,\" and have been checked by control experiments.\nThe Zeitschrift fur Parapsychologie for March has a concluding\nportion of the translation of Prof. Cazzamalli's experiments, and\nalso an article by Prof. Blacher of Riga on an evidential case of\napport-s. From the account of the phenomena provided by the\nauthor the case aj^pears far from evidential, and it is remarkable\nhow writers on supernormal phenomena neglect essential details in\ntheir descriptive narratives, which make their contributions worth-\nless from the scientific point of view.\nIn the same issue are published further notes by Buchner and\nKroner on the Moll trial, and in addition an open letter by the\nlatter to the Director of Police, Berlin, on the value of para-\npsychological phenomena in criminal investigations.\nThe Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology for January has\n\"the report of the Committee which was formed to award \u00a75000\nto any person producing physical phenomena under the conditions\nprescribed by the Committee. These conditions, which seemed to\nimply detailed knowleclge on the part of the Committee of the\nlaws underlying supernormal phenomena, proved unaccejstable, and\nfrom the report it would appear that neither the award nor the\nCommittee offering it were considered seriously by any responsible\nperson, replies being mostly received from psychopathic individuals,\nand in two cases from actual lunatics.\nThe first number of the new Journal issued in connection with\nthe recently-formed British Institute of Philosophical Studies is\nentitled the Journal of Philosophical Studies, and comprises a\nnumber of papers by various writers. The aim of the Journal is\nto provide material of interest to students of philosophy, while at\nthe same time to avoid a preponderance of articles intelligible\nonly to the expert. It hopes to foster the growth of a more\n\"widely diffused philosophical temper ; to publish articles which\n\f78 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Mat, 1926--\nmay stimulate the begimier to study more original sources ; and\nto survey foreign philosophical literature, both in book and\nperiodical form.\nThe Morning Post has recently published ^ a series of articles\nupon \" Spiritualism and the Church,\" in which a correspondent of\nthe newspaper has collaborated with Dr. Percy Dearmer in dis-\ncussing the influence of the spiritualistic movement on orthodox\nreligion. The basis of the discussion is the undoubted fact that\nlarge numbers of people are forsaking the churches and following\nthe teachings of spiritualism, and that therefore there must be\nsome good grounds for this new movement in relation to the\nreligious needs of our time. Some attempt is made, therefore, to\ndescribe Spiritualism and Spiritualists, and to throw some light\nupon their methods and arguments. Dr. Dearmer's treatment of\nthe subject is highly sympathetic, and in his examination of the\nmovement his charity leads him to omit the other side of the\npicture. But although perhaps he is not fully alive to the darker\nand more secret history of spiritualistic activity, he is fully con-\nscious of the need of the scientific method, and in his discussion\nof the necessity of evidence he contributes a glowing appreciation\nof the difficult work of the S.P.E.\nThe Society, he says, \" stands purely for the belief in the value\nof experimental science. It is disliked by many spiritualists\n(though not, I should imagine, by the wisest), because of its\nextremely critical methods, for it has often investigated some\nalleged phenomenon and issued a report with a negative con-\nclusion.\" Proceeding, Dr. Dearmer discusses the meaning of\nproof, and continues :\n\" It was an early work of the S.P.R. to\nestablish canons of evidence of a strictness never known before.\nEvery possibility of human error has to be eliminated ; and the\nmere ixnsupported evidence of one person that he saw a thing is\nregarded as of no importance whatever. Collective evidence is of\nmore value ; and it was by such collective evidence, duly signed,\nand supported by the evidence of contingent events, that one of\nthe earliest investigations was made\u2014that which produced the\nfirst report on \" Phantasms of the Living.\"\nE. J. D.\n1 March 25-27, 29-31; April 1, 3, 5-8.\n\fMat, 1926 Review 79\nREVIEW.\nIntroduction a la Metaphysique. By Kene Sudre. Paris, Payot,\n1926. Pp. M7.\nThree-fourths of this book consist of a rapid, but clear, well-\nwritten and well-arranged survey of the whole field of psychical\nxesearch, which is open only to the criticism that M. Sudre does\nnot sufficiently warn his readers that a large portion of what he\naccepts as fact has actually been disputed, and does not seem to\nmind building elaborate theories on somewhat doubtful foundations.\nThe fourth part is a resolute attempt to deal with the philosophic\nproblems raised by a wholesale acceptance of everything super-\nnormal that has been alleged, and to construct out of it something\nlike a general theory of facts ; and it is clearly to this part of\nhis work that M. Sudre attaches most importance. Here he is\nalways ingenious and stimulating, whether he carries conviction or\nnot.\nThe spiritist interpretation of this phenomena he opposes, put-\nting his objections forcibly, and sometimes exaggerating. It is,\nfor example, too much to say that the spiritistic form which the\nphenomena take is merely a result of training (p. 340) : it seems\nto occur quite spontaneously, and should not be merely put\naside. Again, too much should not be made of the incompleteness\nand triviality of the \" spirit \" messages while our methods of\ncommunication are so rudimentary and defective : for on any\nhypothesis the obstacles must be enormous, and have only been\nvery partially overcome. Philosophically the problem is that of\nintercommunication between two psychologically diverse universes\nor modes of being, and this would naturally involve abnormality\nboth in the communicator and the medium, and possibly also in\nthe sitter. With such conditions, the wonder is that an}i;hing\nthat can be recognised as evidential ever gets through at all\n;\nyet the evidence of spirit-identity, though far from adequate, is\nat all events good enough and abundant enough to render imper-\nsonation by the medium's unconscious mind (or by devils !) a\nsomewhat violent hypothesis. No doubt there is impersonation,\nbut it is not infrequently suggestive of an effort to ;,elect (often\n\"very cleverly) from the contents of the medium's and the sitter's\nminds material that will convey the impression of a third intel-\nligence ; and this selection is not accounted for by tracing the\n\f80 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Mat, 1925.\nmaterial to its sources. It is possible that the difficulty o\u00a3\ngetting through material not in a living mind is so great that\nsuch impersonation by selection may be the best a \" spirit \" can\ndo ; and if it thereby conveys a true impression of its personality,\nit should not be accused of fraud. Lastly, M. Sudre should not\nargue that because the spiritist interpretation is not the only one,\nis not \" cogent,\" and does not appeal to all, it is false. For\nlogically the evidence may not at present warrant decision iix\nfavour of anything. Also all the theories that have been sug-\ngested so far may be partly true and partly false, and, quite-\nprobably, the \" psychical phenomena \" now grouped together may\nturn out to be so complex and heterogeneous that no single-\nexplanation will cover them all.\nNor is it difficult to show that M. Sudre's own theory that\nliving minds possess \" metapsychic \" powers enabling them to\ncommunicate telepathically, to produce telekinetic and teleplastic\neffects, and to tap the memories of the dead, involves serious\ndifficulties. He has to explain the phantoms seen by the dying\nas teleplastic fabrications by the latter (p. 357). He derives the-\nsupernormal knowledge of sensitives and clairvoyants from the\nminds not only of the living, but also of the dead (p. 373) :\nyet he will not admit that these surviving memories attest the\nsurvival of the departed ;\nthey do not form living personalities,\nbut are merely exploited and moulded into impersonations of the-\ndefunct (pp. 375, 394-). Surely unowned memories, which survive\nthe mind that harboured them, and can be (unconsciously) picked\nup by living minds, are new to psychological science, and would\nendow every mind with potential omniscience. But not, according\nto M. Sudre, with immortality. For in spite of its tele]3athy\u00bb\ntelergy and teleplasty, the soul is tied to the fortunes of the\nbody, as a mere dependency ; it cannot transcend the biological\nsphere. But with such supernormal endowments it would seem more\nplausible to conceive it as creating both its body and its material'\nworld, in idealistic fashion. Lastly, with a boldness that does\ncredit to his logic, he is willing to accept the occurrence of\nsuccessful predictions as positive proof of the illusoriness of time\nand freedom and of the reality of an \" eternal present.\" This\ndeduction seems to him (p. 384) to demand merely the sacrifice-\nof a metaphysical theory of M. Bergson's : he hardly realizes that\nwith our immediate experience of the lapse of time would have\n\fMat, 1926 Correspondence 81\nto go our consciousness of change and novelty, and a charac-\nteristic and all-pervasive feature in our whole reality. Surely before\nwe concede all this to the alleged facts of prophecy, we should\nhave to scrutinize our \" facts,\" and to render them far more\nunequivocal and plentiful. It would have to be shown that these\nprophecies were not of the nature of intelligent anticipations, or\nwarnings, or of the sort that bring about their own fulfilment.\nLastly, even if they could not all be explained away, they would\nonly conduct us to the conclusion that our experience was radically\ncontradictory, because, of course, they would not abolish our\nexperiences of change, freedom and novelty.\nNevertheless, there is plenty of room in psychical research both,\nfor the spiritist and for M. Sudre. What is needed at present\nis a good supply of working hypotheses wherewith to explore\nvery anomalous region of phenomena, and, perhaps even more,\nan unremitting endeavour to render both the observation and the\nrecording of the \" facts \" as complete and trustworthy as is\npossible.\nF. C. S. Schiller.\nCOERESPONDENCE.\nI.\nTo the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.\n264 Lexington Ave.,\nNew York, February 11, 1926.\nMadam,\u2014I have been most interested in the account by P. E.\nLeaning, Journal for December, 1925, of further hypnagogic pheno-\nmena. In particular, the report. No. VI, from Professor New-\nbold, I find very suggestive, and possibly of greater import than\nmight at first appear. No one imagines Professor Newbold to be\ndeceived by his imagination, accustomed as he is to strict observa-\ntion and analysis. It is therefore, most suggestive that he, in\ncatching gHmpses of what he took to be the convolutions of his\nown brain and the giant star-shaped cells of the nervous system,\nsaw them aglow with light. The moment he became interested con-\nsciously, it is to be recalled, and excited by his experience,\n\" instantly all disappeared.\"\nOn reading the account, at once there flashed into my mind the\nfamiliar fact that even private psychics, who know nothing of the\n\f82 Jotirnal of Society for Psychical Research. May, 192(5\ntechnical terminology of our subject, have frequently had reference\nto themselves as lights or as embodying some sort of sjDecial light-\nI find, in my own investigations, that each psychic has a tendency\nto turn to one side when \" listening \" for messages, and in the\ncases of Mrs. Chenoweth [Soule], Mrs. Sanders [\" Salter \"], Mrs-\nChamberlaine, and Mrs. Osborne-Leonard, the impressions seem to\naj)proach from the right side, if one may judge by the turn of\nthe head and the attention toward that direction. It occurs to\nme that the psychic \" light \" may be some such light as Professor\nNewbold's vision caught, and it may affect one lobe of the brain\nmore than the other. As the psychics I mention are right-handed,\ntheir psychic work may thus be addressed, so to speak, to the\nless used half of the brain. It is quite in keeping that the light\ndisajjpeared when the consciousness became aware of it, for these\nl^sychics work best when the consciousness is at a minimum, so\nfar as their ordinary senses are concerned.\nWill anyone who is acquainted with one or more left-handed\npsychics observe and rej^ort on the question as to whether such\npsychics appear to gather their clairvoyant and general clair-\nsensory experiences from their attention toward the right or the\nleft side of the body ?\nI have seen in one case with a right-handed private psychic,\nMrs. Sanders, most interesting sujjernormal light effects on the photo-\ngraj)hic film, in a private experiment for psychic j^hotography, and these\neffects were massed to the right of the psychic and slightly above\nthe level of the cranium. The illumination, that is to say, whether\nfrom or toward the psychic's cranium, was on the same side as\nthe right lobe of the brain. Such matters are, if not jDhysical\nphenomena, at least physical concomitants of mediumship and need\nour attention and observations. Gertrude 0. Tubby.\nP.S.\u2014Just after I had written you on the 11th, I ran across\nDr. Hodgson's summary of points about \" light \" from his Piper\nrecords, in Proc. XXIII. Part LVIII, p. 147. I am sorry not\nto have referred to it in my comment.\nII.\nTo the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.\n14.2.26.\nMadam,\u2014As a genealogist I wonder that information under that\nlead has never (to my knowledge) been used as a proof of identity.\n\fMay, 1926 Supplementary Library Catalogue 83\nFor instance, I am interested in a certain John Jones\u2014a man\neminent in a minor way about a century ago. Nowhere can I get\na hint of where he came from by which I can try to trace his\nparentage. Yet the information probably exists and given a lead\ncould be verified. Now, if John Jones would tell us where he was\nborn, his parents' Christian names and his wife's surname, and these\nwere proved correct it would be an exceptional case of identifica-\ntion since it can hardly be alleged that all the parish registers\nand will registries could be clairvoyantly examined by any incarnate\nsubliminal mind.\nB.

R.\nDodds, Sir OUver Lodge, Mr. G. R. S. Mead, and others\ntook part.\nSIXTH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF PHILOSOPHY.\nWe have received from Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, who is a\nCorresponding Member of the Society, an invitation \"to parti-\ncipate in the Sixth International Congress of Philosophy to be\nheld in the United States of America, at Harvard University,\nCambridge, Massachusetts, September 1.3th to 17th, 1926.\"'\nA Programme of the Congress, giving details as to Member-\nship, arrangements for hospitahty, etc., can be seen at the\nSociety's Rooms.\nA REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE.\nThe experiments devised by Miss I. Jephson and alluded to in\nthe Annual Report of the Council for 1925 {Jou rnal, Feb. 1926.\np. 19) appear to offer a prospect of obtaining some useful data\nregarding alleged supernormal processes.\nIn order to extend these observations Members and Asso-\nciates of the Society are asked to co-operate in obtaining the\nrequired data, the value of which will largely depend upon the\nquantity submitted. The experiments can be done at home\nand will take but a short time, requiring for their execution\nneither skill nor previous knowledge of the subject.\nWill those Members and Associates who wish to assist\nnotify the Research Oflficer in the first instance, who wdll\nthereupon forward the necessary instructions ?\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nI. CoNCERNiNa \"A Series of Sittings with Mr.\nGeorge Valiantine.\" ^\nTo the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.\nMadam,\u2014I should Hke to comment upon one or two statements\nmade by Una, Lady Troubridge, in her Report upon Valiantine's\ni\nSee Proc. S.P.E., Vol. 36, pp. 52-77.\n\f88 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June, 1926\nalleged trumpet phenomena. It will be remembered that the\ninvestigation conducted by the Scientific American Committee was\nentirely unfavourable to the claims of this medium, and the\nconclusion arrived at was that fraud would account for all the\nphenomena we then witnessed. I was a member of that Com-\nmittee, and I wish to state that we have seen no good reason\nto change our opinions since then\u2014notwithstanding Mr. Bradley's\nvitriolic attack, in his Towards the Stars. In our estimation,\nfraud was clearly proved on those occasions ; and the general\ntone of Mr. Bradley's writing\u2014hysterical and high-strung as it\nis\u2014does not serve to inspire confidence in his readers, or to\njustify any change of opinion on our part. Lady Troubridge,\nhowever, is evidently a cool-headed and careful investigator, and\nwhat she says must be given due weight. It is unfortunate,\ntherefore, that on the only occasion when she thought she heard\nthe medium's voice at the saiiie time as the \" independent\n\"\nvoice, other sitters in the circle failed to do so, and that when\nthey thought they heard the same thing, she failed to remark it !\nIn view of the mass of negative evidence accumulated, I think\nthe simplest explanation of this isolated instance is\u2014-either that\nLady Troubridge was mistaken in her observation, or that she\nmistook the voice of some other niember of the circle for that of\nValiantine's, on this occasion. Lady Troubridge does not seem to\nrealise the fact that it is the easiest thing in the world for a\nfraudulent medium to produce a '\nvoice '\nat a considerable distance\nfrom his seat, and to speak from it the next instant. When the\nmedium is speaking through the trumpet, the voice issues from\nthe other end of the trumpet, and, if he is leaning forward at the\ntime, the voice is (correctly) located, in the dark, at least four\nor five feet from his chair. Then, if he merely removes his mouth\nfrom the horn, turns his head sideways\u2014at the same moment\nsitting upright again\u2014his natural voice is heard to speak from his\nchair, i.e. four or five feet from the \" independent \" voice\u2014and\npractically instaneously\u2014or a second later. If the trumpet be\ndirected towards the ceiling, the \" independent \" voice will seem\nto be there ; if to the right or left of the circle, it will be heard\nthere, and so on. But the medium can immediately speak from his\nown chair at any time\u2014since the origin of the voice is there.\nBearing these facts in mind, and taking into consideration the\nvery dubious nature of the evidence obtained by the S.P.R.\n\fJuke, 1926 Correspondence 89\ninvestigators ; and remembering, also, the extremelv negative\nresults of our o^vn sittings\u2014in which fraud was clearly proved\u2014\nI\nthink that any fair-minded critic may conclude that Valiantine's\nphenomena are easily explicable, and that fraud alone wiU serve\nto account for all the alleged manifestations produced through his\n\" mediumship.\"\nHereward Carrixgtox.\nNote.\u2014As to the trumpet-sitting given in the light : the\nmedium obviously sat with his back to the window to make\ndirect and prolonged observation of his face more difficult. The\nfaintest sounds are caught up and magnified by a trumpet, held\nin the position indicated. I myself can carry on a prolonged,\nwhispered conversation, with my lips tightly closed, which can be\nheard very clearly in the trumpet, when held in this position ;\nand all the trumpet mediums I have ever seen, who gave \" day-\nlight seances, clearly employed this method. I can see no\nreason to think that Valiantine did otherwise.\nH. C.\nEeply by Lady Troubridge.\nI agree with almost everything that Mr. Carrington says. It\nall comes down to the fact, which has been obvious from the\nfirst, that under the conditions imposed by J\\lr. Bradley\u2014total\ndarkness, no control of the medium and a general atmosphere\nof antagonism to any \" tests \" being required\u2014it becomes quite\nimpossible for any serious investigator to do useful work or to\nform an opinion worth recording of the physical aspects of the\nphenomena.\nAs regards the psychic aspects much the same applies, since\nMr. Bradley introduces his sitters by name ; in many cases there\nare preliminary dinner-parties at which the medium is introduced\nto all the company and is able, should he wish it, to glean such\ninformation as Mr. Bradley and his household may have failed\nto supply. I am not for a moment suggesting that Mr. Bradlev\nwould intentionally prime the medium, but merely that the latter\"\ns\nposition as a guest in a household including Mr. and Mrs. Bradley,\ntheir son and servants, and a younger son of eight years old,\noffers unlimited opportunities for the acquisition of useful data\nanent prospective sitters\u2014especially where the hosts are convinced\nspiritists, who would scam discretion !\n\f90 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June, 1926\nIn making our record of the dark seances M. R. H. and I\nwere careful merely to state, as far as possible, actual happenings\nas they struck us ;\npronouncement as to their mode of production\nwas out of the question. For instance, I recorded that on one\noccasion I heard a \" trumpet voice \" speak at the same tiiiie as\nthe medium. I also duly recorded that on that occasion no one\ncorroborated my impression, and left the reader the option of\ninterpreting the happening to his taste !\nThe same obtains aU through the record. Mr. Carrington,\nhowever, is wrong in suggesting that I mistook another voice for\nValiantine's ; that I did not do so I am quite certain ; Valiantine\nwas too near me, and his voice and accent too individual for\nsuch error to be possible. Again, he is wrong in thinking that I\ndo not realise that by leaning forward and speaking through the\ntrumpet a medium can produce a voice at a considerable distance.\nThat is undeniable, but I still think that in some instances the\ndistance at which the voice spoke would exceed that to be\nobtained in the way Mr. Carrington suggests, unless the medium\nwas in possession of some extension-tube or attachment connecting\nhim with the trumpet.\nAll this, however, is and must remain pure hypothesis, since\nnone of us is in a position to know whether the medium was or\nwas not stuffed with paraphernalia !\nAs regards the mental or psychic content of the utterances we\nare exactly in the same position. Nothing was given at our\nS.P.R. sittings that could not easily have been ascertained by\nthe medium making a few enquiries, while we have no proof that\nhe did so. The definite mistakes made, however, such as Mrs.\nEastman (pseudonym) expressing affection for me, Alfred Herwood\n(pseudonym) claiming acquaintance with M. R. H., our being still\nat Sterling Street, are more suggestive of a medium's natural\nlapses and mistakes than of a succession of errors on the part of\ncommunicators, and the \" Valiantine \" Feda, with her Yankee\naccent and vocabulary, her terrible blunder re Miss Walker, and\nher calling me \" Lady Troubridge,\" is so utterly unlike the\ngenuine \" Feda \" in every respect that no one who used an ounce\nof judgment could find any connexion between the two.\nRe the daylight sittings, Mr. Carrington's explanations of why\nthe medium sat with his back to the light, and regarding the\nreason for the reversed position of the trumpet, are naturally\n\fJune, 1926 Correspondence 91\n\"those which occurred to us. There remains only the question as\nto conversation with the lips \" tightly closed.\" Mr. Carrington\nsays he can achieve this, and in that case there is no need to\nseek a supernormal explanation, but I am bound in honesty to\nsay that neither Miss Radclyfie-Hall nor I can do it, in spite of\nrepeated efforts ; the lips do show movement at some consonants.\nBut on the other hand we have no practice in such forms of\ncamouflage, and if this is the method employed by Valiantine,\nit may safely be assumed that he has worked to perfect it.\nTo sum up : the obvious and flagrant inaccuracies contained in\nthe utterances, which put them entirely \" out of court as\ngenuine psychic communications, justify the deepest suspicion\nregarding the means employed in their production, but the fact\nremains that, thanks to the restrictions on investigation imposed\nby Mr. Bradley, we are none of us in a position to go beyond\n.supposition.\nUna Vincenzo Troubeidge.\nII. Concerning the Discussion on Mr. Soal's Report.\nTo the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.\nMadam,\u2014In connexion with Mr. Seal's Report on his sittings\n-with Mrs. Cooper and the discussion on it in the April issue of\nthe Journal (Vol. XXIII, p. 55 ff.), I should like to suggest that\nit is unscientific to assume that John Ferguson and Dr. Phinuit\n.are fictitious personalities, because they have never been identified.\nIt is quite as unjustifiable an assumption as it would be to assert\ndefinitely that they are not fictitious personalities.\nAbout three years ago the first name of an airman was given\nto me with detailed description and various particulars at a\nsitting with Mrs. Osborn Leonard. I might have (erroneously)\nconsidered this as referring to a fictitious personality, as I could\nrecognise none of the statements made ;\nmy only clue was the\nname of the city of Manchester, which I remembered was the\npost-mark of a letter recently received from a stranger. With\nthis clue I was able to trace the airman, of whose existence I had\nno previous knowledge. This experience has convinced me that\nwe have no right to conclude that because we cannot identify a\n-description it is fair to regard it as fictitious.\nThere is another point on which I would like to comment.\n\f92 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June, 192e-\nMr. Soal says that had Davis turned out to be really dead the-\ncommunication would have been regarded as ''fairly good evidence\"\nfor his continued survival. Some of the contents of the com-\nmunication seem to have been derived telepathically from the-\nsitter, but several incidents were unknown to him, so the source-\ncan only be traced to the living personality of Gordon Davis..\nThese particulars therefore afford \" fairly good \" evidence of\nthe survival of Gordon Davis ;\nthey indicate that in some way\n(at present unexplained), Gordon Davis, alive in the flesh, was the\nsource of the part of the communication which dealt with matters,\nunknown to Mr. Soal.\nWhether Davis was in the body or out of the body, the evi-\ndence justified the conclusion that he survived. What it does not\njustify\u2014and would not justify if he had died\u2014is the conclusion:\nthat he was intentionally and consciously communicating ; in this-\nconnexion the case is valuable. It is not unique in character,,\nbut it affords a useful reminder that mediumistic communications'\nwhich give correct particulars about a deceased person do not;\nnecessarily imply that this person is consciously the source ; whether-\nthat is so or not can only be discovered by the character of the;\ncommunication.\nH. A. Dallas.\n[Note.\u2014With regard to Dr. Phinuit it must be borne in mind',\nthat he did at various times volunteer statements about himself\nand his life on earth, which\u2014so far as they were verifiable\n\u2014\nappear to have been untrue. For some account of the matter,,\nsee Dr. Hodgson's \" Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance,\"\"\nProc. S.P.R., Vol. VIII, pp. 50-58.\u2014\u00a3:\u00ab!.]\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nThe Zeitschrift fiir Parapsychologie for April has a discussion by-\nBaron von Schrenck-Notzing of the series of sittings with Willy-\nSchneider that were undertaken by the Society in the winter of\n1924. He compares the results with those obtained elsewhere, but\ncomplains that the report in certain places omits details essential,\nto a proper understanding of the conditions. It appears that.\nBaron von Schrenck has confused the gauze fence described on\np. 5 of the Report (Proc. S.P.R., Pt. 97) with the gauze cage-\n\fJune, 1926 Notes on Periodicals 9?-\ndescribed on p. 8. Thus when he surmises that at 10.26 p.m.\non Dec. 2, 1924, the tambourine must have executed a high\ncurve before falling on to the ottoman, it would seem that he\nfails to gTasp the fact that at this sitting the fence was em-\nployed and that this, being a three-sided structure, offered no\nimpediment to the fall of the tambourine directly from the table\non to the ottoman.\nIn the same issue Mr. R. Lambert, of Stuttgart, has a useful\nsummary of Mr. Soal's paper recently published in the Proceedings,\nand there are a number of smaller articles, including a brief\naccount of the position of occultism in Greece by Dr. A. Tanagra\nof Athens ; a short paper on Occultism, Science and Religion, by\nDr Seitz ; and an account of a case of dissociation in a child of 13,\nJ\nwhich has some interest as throwing light upon certain psycho-\nlogical aspects of adolescence.\nThe Zeitschrift fur Parafsychologie for May has an interesting\ndiscussion, by Dr. Klee, of the twisting, matting and knotting of\nhorses' tails and manes as reported in various countries, some-\ntimes in connexion with poltergeist cases. These phenomena both\nwith horses and other animals have been noticed from at least\nthe thirteenth century, the knots being usually attributed tO'\nspirits or to\n\\\n\" that very Mab\nthat plats the manes of horses in the night\n\"\n{Romeo and Juliet, i. 4).^\nDr. Klee examines the evidence and sums up the conclusions\nthat can be drawn from it. He hopes that owners of horses\nwill make careful investigations when manes and tails are found\nknotted, in the hope that a satisfactory solution may be found.\nThe Zeitschrift fur kritischen Okkultismus (Bd. 1, Heft 3) has\nan admirable and critical paper by Dr. Moll of Berlin upon the\n\" Clairvoyant \" Ludwig Kahn and his investigators. Dr. Moll\ncomes to the conclusion that this medium produces his effects\nthrough normal means, and he points out how evidence of this\ncan be seen in the reports of the Parisian investigators themselvea\n(see Revue Metapsychique, 1925, 65-79, 132-143). He reveals the\nfact (which has been known for some time by the Society) that\n^ Ct. Lear ii. 3 :\n\" I'll elf all my hair in knots,\"' and the stable phenomena\nreported in the Antigonish Case {J.A.S.P.R., Aug. 1922, 428; and the\nNeuville Case {Ann. d. Sciences psychiques, 1906, 523-527).\n\f\u202294 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June, 1926\nLudwig Kahn is none other than the \" Professor Akyldar or\nAkldar \" whose sandwich-men were parading Eegent St., London,\nin 1920. It has been remarked by students of Kahn's phenomena\nthat there is a decided resemblance between them and those\nproduced by the American medium, Bert Reese. The normal\ncharacter of Reese's phenomena is upheld by critical and informed\npersons who have had experience of them, and thus it seems\nnatural to regard with grave suspicion the phenomena produced\nby the medium Kahn, and to regret the ready acceptance of his\nclaims by the Parisian enquirers. Dr. Moll supplies a startling sup-\nplement to these conjectures in revealing the fact that Kahn him-\nself was actually associated with Reese (or Rees as he puts it) in\nMemphis (U.S.A.) about 1888. This fact, coupled with the additional\nstatement that Kahn was acquainted with Reese's claims as a\nthought-reader, seems to supply some good evidence for the\nsupposition that Kahn's methods are those of Reese, and that\ntherefore the modus operandi is, in some respects at least, identical.\nDr. Moll, in his criticism of the case, shows that he is not\nfully conversant with Reese's methods, although his remarks\nexhibit a singular acuteness in the appreciation of detail. Thus\nhe fully realises that when Kahn insists on touching one of the\nbillets, there is an exchange possible, and he points out how the\nmethod of holding the billets facilitates the manoeuvres. Similarly\nhe ridicules the idea that Kahn uses several billets to make his\nwork harder, and points out how this employment of several\nbillets serves the purposes of trickery, whereas by using one only,\nsubstitution might be more difficult. In conclusion, Dr. Moll\ncomplains Avith some justice that the records are without scientific\nvalue, and closes on the note that the case is a good illustration\nof the oft-repeated errors of investigators of occult phenomena.^\n^ For purposes of historical interest, I add here a short list of those\nreferences to Kahn with which I am acquainted :\n\u2014M.

By Walter F. Prince.\n{Bulletin No. II. of the Boston Society for Psychic Research.)\nBoston. [1926.]\nThis booklet is an examination of an interesting case of alleged\nhaunting, in which the percipients were exposed to chronic poison-\ning by carbon monoxid, a process which is known to be pro-\nductive of hallucinations. The point to which Dr. Prince wishes\nto draw attention is the question whether this poisoning can be\nbelieved to be responsible for all the phenomena observed in the\nhouse. There are certain points in the narrative which seem to\ndiscount this hypothesis, of which the chief appears to be the\noccurrence of the same hallucination to different witnesses at the\nsame time. From the records printed by Dr. Prince it does not\nseem clear what is the precise chronological sequence of the\nvarious documents, and this will permit the supporter of the\n\fJune, 1926 Reviews 99'\npoison theory to suppose tliat this alleged spichxonism of percep-\ntions was due to faulty memories in compiling the records.\nG-enerally speaking, the analysis of the case provided by Dr.\nPrince inclines one to the provisional opinion that the hypothesis\nof '\ncarbon monoxid plus '\nis the more probable ;\nalthough it must\nbe left to each individual reader to decide what constitutes the\nfactor denoted by the term '\nplus.'\nE. J. Dingwall.\nII.\nOkkultismus und Spiritismtis, und ihre iveltanschauUchen Folgerungen..\nBy Richard Baeewald. Pp. 406. Berlin : Deutsche Buch-\nGemeinschaft (1926).\nThis volume, by the Editor of the new Zeitschrift fur kritischen\nOkkultismus, is a thoughtful and serious contribution to the dis-\ncussion of spiritualism. The author is a writer of philosophic\ntemperament, and is not led astray by the emotional quality of\nthe material with which he is dealing. He regards psychical\nphenomena from the standpoint of the psychologist and the\nanthropologist rather than from the religious propagandist or\nutilitarian.\nf As regards the phenomena proper, Dr. Baerwald accepts the\nfact of telepathy, but he appears occasionally to forget that it is\nbut a name for a process and not in any true sense an explana-\ntion of that process. It may be true, as Dr. Baerwald urges,,\nthat the gTeat bulk of the mental phenomena are due to telepathy\nivMr vivos, but an extension of a hypothesis founded upon a\nprocess concerning the mechanism of which we know nothing, can.\nscarcely be considered a satisfactory method of explanation. Such\na course is doubtless legitimate if its origin is clearly envisaged,\nas also are other methods based upon different premises.\nIn his treatment of telepathy and alleged communications from\nthe dead, the author has drawn upon a mass of carefully selected\nmaterial, but in his treatment of the important and neglected\ncase of Staudenmaier (pp. 50-52) it is a pity that he did not\ninclude the almost parallel experiences of \" Mr. Griinbaum \" for\nthe benefit of Continental readers.\nIn his treatment of the physical phenomena Dr. Baerwald shows\nhimself a member of the critical German school, whose numbers\nare happily increasing as the years go on. He analyses witli\n\f100 Journal of Society for Psychical Research jun-e, 1926\nacute penetration the general system of occult theory and practice,\nand in his selection of Thomas Mann's famous account of a seance, he\nillustrates the preposterous conditions of modern investioations.\nAlthough there are decided difEerences of opinion regarding his\ni;heory of the unknown possibilities of the conjurer's art, it must\nbe admitted that Dr. Baerwald has made out a strong case for\nhis own agnostic attitude. The book is a valuable contribution\nto the serious literature of the subject, and its attractive format\nand clear type make it an ideal handbook for the beginner who\nwishes to become acquainted with psychical research from the\npoint of view of the educated and impartial observer.\nE.

A Premonitory Dream.\nWe print below a case of a premonitory dream concerning\nan accident, which has come to us through Sir Oliver Lodge,\nto whom the original report was sent by Lord Latymer, as\nfollows :\n^rd April, 1926.\nApropos of your article in the Strand Magazine\u2014I had an\nexperience four years ago which may be worth putting on paper,\nas small scraps of evidence are worth preserving :\nMy wife came into my dressing-room one morning in January,\n1922,1 while I was shaving, and said :\n\u2014\" Now do be careful\nhunting to-day, as I dreamed last night that you broke your\narm and collar-bone.\" We were married in 1900, and I have,\nexcept during the War, hunted regularly every winter since 1908.\nMy wife does not hunt herself, but had never before shown any\nnervousness about my hunting, nor had she ever before issued a\nwarning ! I laughed and thought no more of it till I was getting\ninto the car at the door to start off for the Meet. She came to\nsee me off, and again repeated what she had said, adding, \" Do\nbe careful, I mean it.\" The Meet (Portman Hounds) was at\nSturminster Newton. Hounds found a fox pretty soon, and at\nthe first fence I jumped, the mare I was on turned upside down,\n1 But see statement by Dr. K\u2014 below.\n\fJuLV, 1926 Cases 103\nand in the scrimmage I broke my right arm, and dislocated it at\nthe same time ;\nbut, be it observed, did not break my collar-bone.\nI got to a doctor pretty soon, who made me as comfortable as\npossible ; and then I rang up my wife on the 'phone, as I was\nsome way from home, to say what had happened. I shall never\nforget the gasp of mingled relief and confirmation which my\ntidings evoked.\nThat is about all. My wife cannot and never could remember\nexactly what she dreamed\u2014what form the dream took. That had\nvanished by the time I questioned her about it ;\nonly the warning\nremained planted firmly and seriously in her mind.\nWhat is a little odd, and to my mind significant, is that the\nwhole of the warning was not fulfilled, though it very .well might\nhave been. Doesn't it look rather as if the issuer of the warning\n(I am purposely vague) saw the accident in some way, and came\nto the conclusion that that kind of fall would mean a broken\ncollar-bone as well as arm ? The prophecy can't have been based\non actual knowledge of what was to occur.\nLatymee.\nThis letter was acknowledged by Sir Oliver Lodge and\nforwarded to the Editor, i'lrs Salter, who on April 13th wrote\na letter to Lord Latymer in w^hich she asked whether\n(a) a first-hand report of her dream could be obtained from\nLady Latymer ;\n(6) the dream might have induced some feeling of nervous-\nness which had in some way brought about its fulfilment\n;\n(c) the exact date of the occurrence could be ascertained ;\n(d) there was any objection to printing the Case in the\nJournal with the names of those concerned.\nIn reply to this communication the following letters were\nreceived from Lord and Lady Latymer :\nI.\n20th April, 1926.\n. , . My wife is quite willing to write a short statement about\nher dream. ... I cannot give the actual date of my accident\nwith the Portman, as I do not keep a diary. Perhaps someone\nin the Himt may have a record as to the day on which they met\nat Sturminster Newton in Jan. 1922\u2014I wiU try to find out. I can\n\f104 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July, 1926\nstate with absolute confidence that I thought no more of what\nmy wife said to me as I was driving away from the front door,\nnor of the earlier warning, until I rang her up on the 'phone to\nsay what had happened. Most emphatically there was no feeling\nof nervousness. I laughed at what she said as a joke, and\nforgot all about it till an hour after the accident. T suppose\nshock and pain prevented me from remembering about it sooner.\nMy wife did not show any particular nervousness, but was\nimpressed in spite of herself.\nLatymer.\nYou can print my letter in your Journal, certainly.\nII.\n2lst April, 1926.\nIn reply to your letter to my husband. Lord Latymer, about\na dream I had in 1922\u2014I am quite willing to answer anytiling\nin my power, but the whole affair was really very simple and\nwithout detail, although quite clear and definite. I cannot give\nyou the exact date\u2014possibly it could be traced by the doctor\nwho set his arm, or the doctor who X-rayed it. I never had\nany previous premonition, I was not specially nervous, and my\nhusband had had no hunting accident, for at any rate years.\nThe facts are as follows : \u2014I dreamt that my husband broke\nhis arm, and I believed his collar-bone, owing to a riding accident.\nOn waking I could not remember the details, but was very im-\npressed with the facts. I did not have quite the sensation of\nan ordinary dream. I was impressed, but it is difficult to explain.\nI went to my husband's dressing-room and told him, but could\nnot remember any details\u2014beyond the fact that he was riding.\nI told him again before he started. Of course he laughed and I\ncould not consider the matter seriously. At the same time I\nremembered the dream with apprehension. When he telephoned\nto me after the accident I was not surprised, but certainly felt\nperturbed at the fulfilling of the premonition. I have never had\nanything of the sort happen since. He broke his arm\u2014but not\nthe collar-bone\u2014although the doctor expressed surprise that that\nwas not broken too. That is all there is to state. I don't object\nto my name being given privately\u2014but do not wish it to be\npublished in a public journal ;\nprivate circulation is all right. . . .\nHester Latymer.\n\fJULT, 1926 Cases 105\nIn replv to an enquiry addressed to him by Mrs. Salter, the\ndoctor who attended Lord Latymer on the occasion of his\naccident writes\n;\n26\/6\/26.\nIn reply to your letter, my records have it that Lord Latymer met\nwith the accident described on February 4th, 1921.\nG\u2014 K\u2014\nIt will be seen that Lord Latymer was mistaken in his re-\ncollection that the accident occurred in January, 1922 ; this slip\nof memory on his part does not, however, materially afiect the\nevidence. '\n'\nII.\nL. 1273. A Telepathic Dream.\nThe foUoAsdng case of a dream, which appears to have been in\npart, at least, of telepathic origin, was first reported to the\nSecretary, ]\\Iiss Newton, by the dreamer, IMiss Hornibrook, with\nwhom ]\\'Iiss Newton is personally acquainted. Miss Newton\nwrites as follows :\nOn the 18th of February, 1926, Miss Hornibrook, who was\npassing through London on her way from Guildford to Suffolk,\nlunched with me and related her dream and the apparent confir-\nmation of it which was contained in a letter that she had received\nfrom her sister in Persia that morning. She subsequently sent me\nthe following accounts :\nMiss Hornibrook's Statement.\nOn the morning of Feb. 17tli I awoke suddenly in the midst\nof a very vivid dream about the twins,\u2014so vivid that when my\nfriend Miss Jackson came into the room a little later, I told it to\nher, adding that I hoped the twins were all right.\nI thought I was walking alone\u2014strolling without any object\u2014in\na dull, gloomy place, out of doors. There was apparently no\nvegetation and it was either a very grey day or twilight. To\nmy left and a little in front of me were shallow pools of muddy\nwater, some of them large enough to be called ponds, but none\nmore than about a foot deep. Presently, as I strolled along, I\nbecame aware that the twins were paddling about in them, though\nI saw no one else near. Suddenly there was a sound of a splash\n\f106 Journal of Society for Psychical Research jult, 1926\nand little Arthur's voice screaming. I ran for all I was worth\ntowards the muddy water where I could see him almost on his\nback with his head up yelling, and up to his elbows and knees\nin thick mud^ unable to move. As I ran I became aware that a\nman was running towards him also, but from the opposite direc-\ntion. I got there first, and putting my hands underneath him,\nlifted him out with a squelch, and started to carry him, still\ncrying, back towards a house. As I walked I found the man was\nwalking beside me, and the thought crossed my mind that I had\nnot seen his face and wondered who he was, but decided I could\nnot bother to look at him as I had to quiet little Arthur and get\nthe mud off him. Then I awoke.\nA. B. HORNIBROOK.\nCorroborative statements have also been obtained from two\nfriends of Miss Hornibrook's to whom she related the dream\nbefore she received the verification of it in the letter from her\nsister. These statements were contained in a letter to Miss\nHornibrook, as follows :\nFeb. 24 [1926].\nAs far as I can remember this is what you told me of your\ndream on Tues. Feb. 16th.i\nYou said that you dreamt that Arthur had fallen in a pond.\nYou ran out to rescue him and there was some man who was\nalso running, only you didn't see his face. You said Arthur was\ncovered with mud almost up to his chin, as he was in a kneeling\nposition on his hands and knees and had sunk in and was stuck.\nYou said you had a little difficulty in getting him out, but\nmanaged to lift him out and carry him to the house.\nG. Hamilton Jackson.\nThis is what I also can remember you telling me.\nI. Hamilton Jackson.\nAVith regard to the first of these corroborative statements\nMiss Hornibrook wrote to Miss Newton thus :\nMarch 6th, 26.\nI enclose Greta's letter, but am afraid it is not much good about\nmy dream, as she says I told her the little man was in a kneeling\n^This is evidently a slip of the pen for Feb. 17tli\u2014see Miss Hornibrook's\nstatement.\n\fJuly, 1926 Cases 107\nposition. As a matter of fact, what I said was that he was\nstuck in the mud up to his elbows and knees, and she took it\nthat he must have fallen forward, whereas I meant to give her\nthe impression that he was in a sitting position, or almost lying\non his back. I also told her a very shallow muddy sort of pond,\nmore like a bog. I will find Eileen's account of the incident and\nenclose it. The rest of Grreta's account is all right, as I told it\nto her ...\nAmy B. Hornibrook.\nP.S.\u2014l see that Eileen does ..not specifically state that Arthur\nAvas on his back, but in my dream he was. I enclose the whole\nletter, as you may like to read it. The story about Arthur is\non the last page.\nThe following is an extract from the letter referred to :\n110 Bungalow, c\/o A.P.O.C.,\n]\\Iasjid Suliman,\nVia Ahwaz,\nG. or P.,\nJan. mil, 26.\n... Oh, I must tell you about New Year's Day before I stop.\nIt was a pouring wet day and when itjjains here the place gets\nthick with mud in no time. It had been raining the day before\ntoo, and the twins were a bit fed up with the house and begged\nto go out, so I put on their boots and stockings, coats and hats\nand turned them out\u2014then I went to dress for we had been up\ntill the early hours of the morn at a dance. Just as I was\nfinishing dressing I heard yells of \" Mummy \" and I seized a coat\nand dashed out to meet Billo running in from the hill opposite\nour gate. He said would I come and rescue Arthur who was\nstuck. So I ran off, slipping about in the mud, and eventually\nfound Arthur in a sunken bit of ground up to his knees in thick\nslime\u2014unable to budge\u2014his hands had clawed the bank and were\n.also up to the elbows in mud. I was just reaching him when a\ncoolie on the hill saw the position and came down to lift Arthur\n\u2022out. He stepped into the mud and caught Arthur under the\narms to haul him out, but Arthur objected to a coolie touching\niim and started screaming and pushed the coolie, who promptly\nsat down in it ! I tried to argue with Arthur and the coolie\n\f108 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July, 192G;\njabbered in his own language, and Arthur howled and struggled\nwith the coolie, but at length the coolie hauled him out and we\ngot back to the bungalow. Well, honestly, you've never seen such\na sight in all your life ! He was up to his knees in thick slime-\nand really it took me about five minutes scraping the mud of?\nwith my hands before I could even find his boots or laces to get\nthem ofJ ! But I thought Billo was very sensibile\u2014he said to me\nafterwards, \" You know. Mummy, if I had seen that coolie first\nI could have asked him to get Arthur out and not worried you.\"'\nMiss Newton writes :\nThe dream recalled to me a remark made by Miss Hornibrook\nwhen, staying with her last summer, I took the twins for a walk.\nAs she saw us oiJ at the gate she said to Arthur, \" Now, don't\nfall down in the mud,\" and added in explanation to me, \" If\nthere is any mud anywhere Arthur will fall down in it.\" The\nprediction proved true, and the accident was triumphantly reported\nby Billy on our return.\nIt seemed to me, therefore, that the dream might be merely\nan association dream, and I asked Miss Hornibrook if anything\nhad occurred on the previous day to remind her of the children.\nShe answered No\u2014but added that Mrs. Jackson on hearing of the\ndream had at once attributed it to a picture in the Dcdly Mirror\nthe day before of two little boys who had been drowned in a\npond. Miss Hornibrook told me that she had read the Daily\nMirror during the evening, but had no recollection of having seen.\nthe picture or any reference to the accident.\nThe printed matter in connection with the picture in the Daily\nMirror of February 16th is as follows :\nBROTHERS DROWNED : Two little brothers, Henry Harris\n(left), aged seven, and Robert Harris, aged six, who were\nfound drowned in a pond near their home at Hadleigh (Essex).\nThey did not return home from Sunday school, and the\ntragedy was discovered by their mother when a search was\nmade.\nIt is reasonable to suppose that the picture might have started\nthe dream, for a pond had been the cause of a good deal of\nanxiety to Miss Hornibrook in connexion with the twins. They\nwere very young (born in May, 1921) and were left in her sole\n\fJuly, 1'J2(; Cases 109'\ncharge for a year, until they went out last September to their\nparents in Persia. The pond was divided from the garden in\nwhich they played by a rather low railing, which attracted them ;\nif they had climbed it they would probably have fallen head first\ninto the water, and I knew that Miss Hornibrook worried about\nthis possibility. On April 9th I addressed to her the following,\nquestions, to which she appended her replies :\n^\n(1) Do you often dream of Billy and Arthur?\nOccasionally.\n(2) \/\/ so, have you ever dreamed before of mud in connexion with\nthem ?\nNo.\n(3) Have you noticed any recurrent feature in your dreams of\nthem ?\nNo.\n(4) Did you relate the dream at hreahfast because it had been\n'particularly vivid, or were you reminded of it by someone else ?\nYes, it was so vivid that I told Greta before breakfast when\nshe came into my room before I was up.\n(5) Will you please think of all the little natural accidents asso-\nciated ivith mud that have befallen Arthur that you can remember.\nWas there a man associated with any one of them, e.g., passing at\nthe time, or helping Arthur to get up again ?\nNo, I never remember any man being present when Arthur fell\nin the mud.\n(6) \/ have the newspaper with the account of the two little boys\n'\nfalling into a pond, and I think that you must have seen it {though\nyou may not remember looking at it), for there is a photograph of\nthe children in a conspicuous place. I am inclined, to think that you\nmay have subconsciously received a telepathic or clairvoyant impres-\nsion of Arthur's accident at about the time either when it occurred\nor when Eileen wrote the letter, and that it emerged with other\nassociations in your mind when these associations ivere stimulated bij\nthe idea that started the dream, viz., the accident to the two children\nreported in the \" Daily Mirror.'\"\nI must have seen it as I had the Mirror, hut I did not remem-\nber seeing it when Mrs. Jackson mentioned it the next day.\n^The questions put by Miss Newton are printed in italics.\n\f110 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July, 1926\nWe print this case because it is suggestive of the kind of\nway in which an impression telepathically received may be\nhelped to emerge into consciousness by natural associations in\nthe percipient's mind. It is possible that the impression was\noriginally received by Miss Hornibrook either when the incident\nin question occurred (New Year's Day) or when her sister\nwrote the account of the incident as printed above (January 13,\n1926) ; on this point evidence is for ob\\'ious reasons unobtain-\nable. As evidence of the partly telepathic origin of the dream\nit is worth noting that the man who figured in the dream can\nbe accounted for as representing the coolie who figured in the\nactual incident, whereas he is not accounted for either by the\nreport of the drowning accident in the Daily Mirror, or by Miss\nHornibrook's association of the boy Arthur with adventures in\nthe mud. On the other hand, it is reasonable to suppose that\nthe dream was, so to speak, precipitated both by these asso-\nciations and, more immediately, by Miss Hornibrook's attention\nbeing called to the drowning of two little boys. It is possible\nalso that the near approach of the letter, received by Miss\nHornibrook on February 18, 1926, the day after her dream,\nplayed some part in the emergence of the telepathic impression.\n{For parallel cases see Myers's Human Personality, Vol. I., pp.\n392-394, and Vol. II., p. 324).\nNOTE ON THE \" OSCAR WILDE \" SCRIPT.i\nBy S. G. Soal.\nIt may not be without interest to point out the probable\nsource of a certain passage in the \" Oscar Wilde \" script.\nThis occurs in the third script written by me on July 2, 1923,\nin the presence of Mrs. Travers-Smith.^ The soi-disant \" Wilde\n\"\ndescribing his posthumous attempts to see through the eyes\nof living people writes :\n... I have found sight in the most curious places. Through\nthe eyes out of the dusky face of a Tamil girl I have looked on\nigee Review by Mrs. Henry Sidgwick, Proc. S.P.E., Vol. XXXIV., pp. 1S6-\n196, and bibliography there given.\n^ See Psychic Messages from Oscar Wilde, by Mrs. Travers Smith, p. 18.\n\fJuly, 1926 Note on the \" Oscar Wilde \" Script 111\nthe tea fields of Ceylon and through the eyes of a wandering\nKurd, I have seen Ararat and the Yezedes luho worship both God\nand Satan and who Jove only snakes and peacocks.\nI think it will be agreed that the portion in italics is charac-\nteristic of the living Wilde in his most bizarre and fanciful\nmood. Without incongruity or literary offence it might be\ninterpolated, for instance, into the following passage taken from\n\" The Fisherman and his Soul \" and thus used :\nWhen the dwellers in the villages saw us coming, they poisoned\nthe wells and fled to the hill-summits. We fought with the\nMagadae who are born old. and grow younger every year and die\nwhen they are little children ; and with the Laktroi who say that\nthey are the sons of tigers and paint themselves yellow and black ;\nand with the Yezedes who worship both God and Satan and who\nlove only snakes and peacocks ; with the Aurantes who bury their\ndead on the tops of trees and themselves He in dark caverns, lest\nthe Sun who is their god should slay them ; and with the Krim-\nnians who worship a crocodile and give it ear-rings of green glass\nand feed it with butter and fresh fowls . . .\nThe passage in question, however, does not occur in any\npublished work of Wilde, and only quite recently I have dis-\ncovered what would appear to be its source.\nIn Vol. I., p. 227, of Peoples of all Nations, edited by J. A.\nHammerton, is a picture of a woman devil-worshipper with the\nfollowing note.\nWOMAN DEVIL-WORSHIPPER OF MOUNT ARARAT.\nShe helongs to the far scattered sect of the Yezedes ivho worship\nboth God and Satan and are devoted to peacocks, snakes, water and\nthe sun. They are forbidden to learn reading and writing.\nThis book was undoubtedly in my possession at the time of\nthe sitting. The work was published in serial form in fort-\nnightly parts, but I received it from the newsagent in bound\nvolumes at intervals of seven or eight weeks. By the begin-\nning of July, 1923, I must have had several of these volumes\non my shelves.\nIt is just possible that in the sentence which follows the one\nquoted (in the same script) we have an echo of the concluding\n\f112 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July, I92s\nline of Harold Munro's Children of Love (Georgian Poetry,\n1913-1915), a poem which I had certainly read some years\nbefore the sitting, since I received the book as a present in\n1918.\nThe last line of the poem reads, \" But Jesus went weeping\naway and left him there wondering why,\" and this may be\ncompared with the following sentence from the script\n:\nOnce iu a pleasure steamer on its way to St. Cloud I saw the\ngreen waters of the Seine and the lights of Paris through the\nvision of a little girl who clung weeping to her mother and\nwondered why.\nWe have now succeeded in tracing many passages in these-\nscripts to their probable origins. The greater part of the\nfirst script, for instance, seems definitely plagiarised from De\nProfundis. The literary criticisms of modern writers (at least\nthose contained in my own script) seem modelled on those\ncontained in Wilde's essay, The Decay of Lying. The know-\nledge of Poincare, Kepler, Tycho Brake, etc., is probably derived\nfrom my own mind. The references to incidents in the life\nof Wilde seem to have been gathered from different printed\nsources. The variety of sources from which the script is\ndrawn is as amazing as the adroitness with which the know-\nledge is worked up into sentences conveying impressions of the\ndifferent mannerisms of Wilde's literary style. But as Dr.\nSchiller rightly remarks in another connection, by tracing the\nfacts to their source one does not thereby identify the mind\nthat is responsible for the selection.\nIf, however, it shoidd eventually turn out that in cases\nwhere the communicators are shown to be purely fictitious\ncharacters the supernormal selection of material to support the\nimpersonation is as varied and ingenious as in the apparently\nspiritistic cases, then we should have at least a presumption in\nfavour of the view that in these latter also the supernormal\nselection may be the work of living minds.\nWe freely admit, however, that much more experiment is\nrequired on these fictitious cases, and suggest that such com-\nmunications shoidd be deliberately encouraged by those under-\ntaking sittings with mediums.\n\fJuLT, 1926 Co )'respondence 113\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nI. The Cases of Moss and Munxixgs.\nTo the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.\nMadam,\u2014In the account of these cases printed in the May\nJournal, No. 425, p. 71 ff., you have not made the very pertinent\nremark that in each case it was the observations and the initia-\ntive of spiritualists which exposed the fraud. In both instances\nit might easily have been dealt with privately, but Mr. M'Kenzie\nof the Ps3^chic College, in the first instance, and the signatories\nin the second, including Mr. Bradley, insisted upon the fullest\npublicity.\nAs to Munnings, your article seems to sneer at those who main-\ntain that the man had true psychic power in spite of his roguery.\nI would remind the writer that in the Cambridge experiments the\nS.P.R. , or some of its leading members, turned down Busapia\nPalladino as fraudulent on account of her obvious tricks, and yet\nthat a sub-committee of the same Society, including Mr. Baggally,\nthe Hon. Everard Feilding and Mr. Carrington afterwards reported\nthat the psychic powers were genuine. What was true of Eusapia\nmay well be true also of Munnings.\nArthur Conan Doyle.\nii. coisrceening a supposed premonitory impression printed\nIN THE Journal.\nTo the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.\nMadam,\u2014It was not until I saw an account of a case of sup-\nposed prevision (reported in the ^S.P.i?. Journal, Vol. XVI., pp. 29-31)\nthat I knew that it had been included in your records.\nThe case was, briefly, that a quarry owner visited his quarry\non a certain morning, and that after leaving, he sent a telegram\nfrom an office a few miles away warning the local manager that-\na fall of rock was impending, which afterwards came down.\nAfter making certain enquiries I find that this case is one that\noccurred in Carnarvonshire and with which I was familiar. It\ncaused a good deal of comment among slate-quarry managers at\n\f114 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July, 1926\nthe time, almost entirely adverse to the idea that the sending of\nthe telegram was due to premonitory influence.\nHad this wire been sent without the sender having visited the\nquarry within, say, forty-eight hours, there would be strong grounds\nto attribute the case to some psychical agency, but the fact that\nhe had been to the quarry within a few hours renders this most\nimprobable.\nIt may here be stated that for ten years the writer of this\nmemorandum acted as local manager to one of the largest slate\nquarries in that section, one adjoining the quarry that this case\nrefers to. It was my responsibility amongst others to see that\nthe rock was safe for the workmen, and it was my misfortune,,\nowing to the way that quarry had previously been opened up, to-\nacquire expert knowledge of everything appertaining to \" falls.\"\nPerhaps it should be mentioned here that slate-rock should be\nbrought down systematically in blocks, and that \" falls \" are a\ncalamity. After leaving here I took charge of the well-known\nPenrhyn Slate Quarries, where I have been now fifteen years.\nFortunately, it is an extremely rare occurrence for any consider-\nable body of rock to come down without giving plenty of warning.\nThe most common is for small pieces to flake away and come\ndown. Usually these are too small to be harmful. Other indi-\ncations are the appearance of surface cracks, a veining of the face\nof the rock itself, slight noises, and certain indications known only\nto quarry men themselves and unexplainable by them. It is the\nduty for the overlookers to be looking out continually for these\nwarnings in order to report them to the manager.\nIt is important also to remember that the Mr. John referred\nto had not only been familiar with quarrying operations since his\nboyhood, but that his father and grandfather had similar, if not\ngreater experience, so that he may have had from them some\ninherent instinct.\nThe natural explanation, therefore, is that his eyes (possibly,\nbut not probably, his ears) registered some indication that a fall\nwas impending, but that this information was not transferred to\nthe mind until some time later\u2014nearly everyone can recall similar\nexperiences. Often the information is not transferred till an\nensuing incident occurs to stimulate it.\nEortunately the loss of life owing to these warnings is almost\nunknown where falls are concerned, though less happily accidents\n\fJuly, 1926 Review 115\ndo sometimes occur owing to comparatively small pieces of rock,\noften only a few pounds in weight, falling down from the working\nface of the rock down on to a man working below.\nWalter D.

Davies.\nREVIEW.\nWunder der Hypnose, erweiterte Hypnotherapie. By Ubald Tar-\nTARUGA. Pfullingen, Johannes Baum. Pp. 42. With 15\nillustrations.\nThis is No. 11 of the pamphlets produced by the Parapsychic\nInstitute of Vienna. In it Dr. Tartaruga, after a short historical\nintroduction, calls iu question \" the current medical opinion that\nsuggestion \" is a sufficient explanation of all the facts of hyjJ-\nnotism. He refers to Dr. Alrutz's experiments to show that\nthere is also some physical influence, and relates the investigation\nconducted by the Parapsychic Institute into the claims of a\nprofessional hypnotizer in Vienna, one August Grundmann. A\nnoted Viennese psychiatrist having denied that the subjects to\nwhom a \" hypnotic crime \" had been suggested were really unaware\nthat it was not a real crime, Grundmann undertook to convince\nhim of his error by an assassination aimed at himself ; he sug-\ngested to his subject, a young girl, a motive for hating the doctor,\nand equipped her with a revolver she had every reason to believe\nwould go off successfully. The result was, that the subject lay\nin wait for the doctor for three days, and then made her attempt^\nwhich got into the papers, and made a great sensation. Grund-\nmann was arrested as an accomplice, but was able to show that\nthe whole affair was only a scientific experiment. In addition to\nthis he claimed to be able to enlarge, by suggestions, the breasts\nof some female subjects unilaterally, to enable a patient who had\nbeen paralysed and had sustained curvature of his backbone in\nconsequence of acute poliomyelitis, and been declared \"incurable,\" to\nwalk and to carry burdens of 130 pounds, and lastly to duplicate\n\f116 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

All these claims were\nverified at the Parapsychic Institute, and seem to be convincingly\nillustrated by the photographs of the subjects. Dr. Tartaruga\nvery justly insists that these results are sufficiently remarkable to\nrender it the duty of the medical profession to study and to\nutilize the possible extensions of hypnotic therapy which are thus\nindicated.\nF. C. S. Schiller.\nNOTES ON PEEIODICALS.\nThe Journal of Ahnormal and Social Psychology for April has the\n\"welcome news that an anonymous benefactor has donated a fund\nto Harvard University for the purpose of founding a Ghair of\nAbnormal and Dynamic Psychology. We are glad to note that\na number of voluntary assistants may be appointed, so that\nannually a number of students may have the opportunity to\nbecome familiar with abnormal phenomena. It is to be hoped\nthat the example may be followed elsewhere, and also that the\ninterest in abnormal mental states thereby aroused may spread to\na consideration of the phenomena at present investigated almost\nsolely by psychical researchers.\nThe Zeitschrift fur Parapsychologie for June has a long criticism\nby Mr. Karl Krall of the theory of Lehmann and Hansen regard-\ning involuntary whis^^ering in experiments for thought transference.\nHe points out that those who cannot control an impulse to\nwhisper during such exjaeriments should be excluded, and he\nminimises the difficulty of detecting involuntary whispering,\ninsisting on the necessity of keeping the mouth entirely closed.\nE.

W. Trethewy.\nThe Rev. Charles Drayton Thomas has been continuing the\nseries of newspaper tests of which an early selection aj)peared\nin the S.P.R. Journal for May, 1921, and others formed the\nsubject of his book Some New Evidence for Human Stirvival,\npublished by Messrs. Collins Sons & Co., Glasgow, 1922. The\npresent article relates to three cases subsequent to those set\nforth in that book.\n\fOcTOBEK, 1926 Three Newspaper Tests 119\nIn two of them, those relating to Ray and Beard, it was\npractically impossible for the medium, Mrs. Osborne Leonard,\nor the sitter, the Rev. Charles Drayton Thomas, at the time\nwhen the tests were given to have had by normal methods\nthe information which was to be verified. Their ignorance\ndid not merely relate to the contents of a newspaper not yet\nin print, but extended to the antecedent facts alleged, which\nwere expressed in so cryptic a manner that the names of the\ntwo persons concerned, alleged to be dead, were not disclosed.\nThe third case, that of Strevett, which will be described\nfirst, did not originate with a newspaper test, but reached\nthat stage only after his death was known. It is included\nbecause it occurred during the same period as the other two,\nand the three are so closely connected that they must all be\nconsidered together.\nI. The Strevett Case.\nStrevett was a man who had been known at The Lcysian\nMission, City Road, E.C. 1, for many years ; Mr. Thomas\ngives the following account\n:\nMy colleagues had occasionally helped him, and in later years\nI believe he came to regard me as one of the few who under-\nstood him and to whom he might turn for help when increasing\nweakness rendered it difficult to obtain a liviii\u00a3>'. During recent\nyears I occasionally visited him in hospital and infirmary. I had\nnot heard of him for some weeks wlien the following incident\ntook place at a sitting with Mis. Leonard on November 11th,\n1921. Feda (the control) suddenly asked:\nFeda. Have you lu'ard of someone who lias just passed\nover ?\n1 r('])iii'd that 1 had not.\nFeua. 1 feid a peculiar condition, not quite in the sitting.\nIt is as if someone who knows you had just passed\nover and was sending thought towards you.\nI inquired how she could be aware tliat this person\nhad only recently passed.\nFeda. Because it is a new feeling and as if lie had not\ndone it before. It feels like a rather old person,\nFeda gets a tired feeling with it.\n\f120 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, 192()\nI a.sked whether she supposed that someone was\nthinking of me because I was just then at a\nsitting.\nFeda. Yes, liut he has not quite the power to come here\nhimself.\nI then wished to know whether my communicators,\nFather and Sister, were also aware of this.\nFeda. They are not taking any notice of it. It is sent to\nyou, not to them. Feda gets it because it is sent\nto you and she is in touch with you now through\nthe medium. Spirits often send thoughts which\nthose in the body cannot feel ;\nalthough their\nsubconscious mind receives the impression the\nconscious mind does not understand it, but may\nyet feel vaguely comforted. A\u00a5ere the conscious\nmind psychically developed it might get part of\nthe message. Your Father says that Feda can\nget it, although it does not reach your conscious\nmind, because her mind is more receptive to any-\nthing of this sort. The thought is sent out to\nyou, and as you fail to receive it it flies on to the\nnext receiving station and is there caught, some-\nthing like picking up a wireless message.\nI remark that I cannot guess who it may be that is\nthinking of me.\nFeda. It feels like a man, Feda cannot tell Iwtv she feels\nthat, but it is like when one knows a thing without\nknowing how it is known. You will be sure to\nhear about this and it will be interesting. Feda\nfeels it is some one nice, for it is a nice feeling.\nThe day following this sitting I left home and was away for\nsix days, i.e. from the 12th to the 18th. My first intimation of\nStrevett';< death was when, on my return, I learnt of a telephone\nmessage from the Coroner saying that a man named Strevett,\nwho had died suddenly in the Infirmary, had given my name as\nthe person to be informed in case of death. Calling at the\nInfirmary I learnt that Strevett had been admitted on the 7th\nof November and that they had posted me an admission card on\nthe 11th (the day of the sitting), and that he had died in his\n\fOctober, 1926 Three Newspaper Tests 121\nsleep on the night of the 13th. There is no doubt but that\nStrevett would have been thinking about me, hoping and expecting\nto see me ; and as he was very ill, and possibly anticipating\nhis end, such thoughts may possibly have originated the feeling\nof which Feda spoke. On the chance of getting some interesting\nremarks I briefly stated at my next sitting, November 2.5th,\n1921, that the person apparently referred to by Feda as recently\npassed had not died until two days afterwards ; and I inquired\nwhether Feda considered that her impressions might have been\nproduced by his thoughts being directed towards me ? She\nreplied :\nFeda. Yes, it is sure to have been that. But such a\nthing only happens when death is certain. ^\nI objected that the nurses had no idea that he was\nabout to die.\nFeda. But his spirit might have been aware of it. Your\nFather says, '\"\nThe subconscious mind is the greater\nor spirit mind and it often knows about events\nwhich are going to affect it in the near future,\nespecially such an important change as passing from\nthe body, a matter which the conscious mind\nmight only know in rare instances. Often in\nearth life, when an important change is coming,\nyou may feel that something is impending although\nyou may have no inkling of its nature.\"\nFeda could not see that man, but only knew and\nfelt. Your Father remarks that it is an interesting\npoint that neither he nor Etta knew. Had the\nman been over on their side and separated from\nhis body they think they would have at least felt\nhis presence, even if not actually seeing him.\nDaring this discussion, Mr. Thomas may, he thinks, have\nmentioned Strevett's surname, but not his Christian name.\nThe subsequent development of the case is recorded by Mr.\nThomas, as follows :\n1 1 recalled this to Feda at a sitting on May 14th. 1926, after Mr.\nTrethewy had raised the point, and asked her what exactlj' she had meant.\nShe replied that she had alluded to \"foreknowledges of death,\" the man's\nsoul had foreseen the approaching end although he might not have been\nconscious of it in his mind. C. D. T.\na2\n\f122 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, 1926\nAt the sitting of January 20th, 1922, the following was one of\nthe tests given for verification from the morrow's Times :\nThe Times to-morrow, page one, column one, a little lower\nthan half down, is a name of the old man who passed over\nand visited us here in his astral body before he finally\npassed.\nLooking next morning at the place indicated I found the\nChristian name of my poor friend Strevett, namely, Ebenezer.\nThis was between three-quarters and half-way down the first\ncolumn, and it is a name not frequently found there. The\nphrasing of this test shows my communicator's opinion of the\nreal significance of the Strevett episode. As to his use of the\nterm \" astral body,\" he has explained that this and similar ones\nare only employed for lack of better, and that they suffice to\nconvey the general meaning.\nDuring the four years which have passed since the above I\nhave received several communications ostensibly from Strevett.\nTheir internal evidence and character leave no doubt in my mind\nas to the Strevett authorship. Considerations of space preclude\ntheir inclusion here.\nOf course the evidence of Strevett's identity is not strong.\nIt is based on the coincidence of Strevett's dying condition\nwith the occurrence of the attempted message noticed by Feda,\nand on his relations with Mr. Thomas which render the attempt\nconceivable. The theory is a plausible speculation, but there\nis no corroboration except the Ebenezer test, which is not\nconclusive because the name was known to the sitter, and\ntherefore, perhaps, to the medium ; for in the passage above\nquoted Feda says that she is in touch with Mr. Thomas.\nIt is possible that looking through the paper with his sub-\nliminal memory at her command she came on the name\nEbenezer and realised that it fitted the case. If Mr. Thomas\nhad not guessed that Strevett was the person who was said\nto have tried to communicate with him, nothing might have\nbeen heard of his name. On the other hand there is notliing\nimpossible in the claim, and considering its association with\nthe other two cases which are supported by stronger evidence,\nwe may be justified in believing that it may be true, though\n\focTOBEE, 1926 Three Newspaper Tests 123\nincapable of proof. Of course tliere is no reason to suppose\nthat the medium Mrs. Osborne Leonard could have been\nnormally conscious that Strevett's name was Ebenezer.\nII. The Beard Case.\nMr Thomas writes :\nOn January 6th, 1922, during my usual fortnightly sitting with\nMrs. Leonard, Feda gave the following message from my Father\nand Sister. These were my regular communicators, and they\nboth had given me conclusive proofs of their identity. My\nFather passed over in 1903, and my Sister in 1920.\nSomething about one who passed quite lately, it is one whom\nthey have been helping,^ and who went rather quickly.\nYour Father is very serious about this, as if he wishes to\nbe careful.\nThen followed some clues to the identity of the deceased,\nsome newspaper tests concerning him, and some more clues.\nThese clues and tests will be stated in detail below. Nothing\nmore need be said about them at present than that they gave\nno indication of identity to Mr. Thomas at the time. His\nreport is continued with reference to the same sitting :\nPresently Feda bid farewell and my Father took her place as\ncontrol. While speaking directly through the medium he intro-\nduced a reference to the abovementioned Strevett episode, but\nwithout giving the name, and asked me if I had carefully noted\nwhat had been said respecting that class of incident. On my\nreplying in the affirmative he continued :\nNote that that may happen again to you. It would be\nimportant to prove if it be possible for the soul to know\nwhen it is about to be freed. I am not certain if it can\nknow excepting when the freedom is very near at hand.\nI then asked whether he intended to connect these remarks\nwith the person who formed the subject of the Times test.\n^ The nature of the help given was not indicated. On several other\noccasions, however, allusion has been made to their efforts in relieving\nillness of friends on earth, also to giving guidance and instruction to those\nrecently passed over. C. D. T.\n\f124 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, 1926\nHe replied, \" Do not press. I do not want to spoil things.\"\nThere was some further conversation which left me with the\nimpression that the subject of the day's tests might not yet have\nactually passed, but be upon the verge of doing so.\nScrutiny of the next day's Times and Morning Post did not\nhelp me ; I could only think of one person to whom the reference\nmight just possibly apply, and inquiries immediately proved that\nit did not in any way connect with him.\nSix days later I saw in our Church paper, The Methodist Re-\ncorder, a notice as follows :\nBeard. January 7th, at Southborough, near Tunbridge\nWells, Rev. Samuel Wesley Beard ;\naged eighty years.\nRemembering that Mr. Beard had been known to his parents,\nand that the initial \" B \" had been declared applicable to the\ndeceased in one of the newspaper tests of January 6th, Mr.\nThomas brought up the subject at his next seance, on January\n20tli, 1922, and after some conversation, which will be repeated\nin detail below, asked if the deceased was Mr. Beard, and\nreceived a reply in the affirmative.\nAt this stage a further quotation from Mr. Thomas's report\nis given ;\nOn returning home with this further information I was in a\nposition to examine the Times and the Morning Post for January\n7th, and determine how far any correspondence discovered there\nmight apply to Mr. Beard. It is important to place on record\nhow little I kneAV about him at this time, merely the few facts\nfollowing :\nHe had been occasionally mentioned by my Mother as a Minister\nwho retired and went to live near .Tunbridge Wells many years\nago, and whose retirement had been necessitated by an unusual\nform of throat trouble which, however, did not prevent his taking\nnumerous preaching appointments in Tunbridge Wells and the\nsurrounding villages. Further than this I knew nothing, except\nthat he must be elderly. To the best of my recollection I had\nnever seen him, and certainly knew nothing whatever about his\nfamily.\nMy first discoveries were as follows :\nHiWs List, a reference book relating to Wesleyan Ministers,\nshowed in what towns the Rev. Samuel W. Beard had worked\n\fOCTOBEE, 1926 Three Newspaper Tests 125\nduring his Ministerial career, and from it I learnt, to my sur-\nprise, tliat he had been my father's colleague at Taunton a year\nbefore my birth there.\nI had frequently heard my parents speak of a family named\nFrench at Taunton and of Mr. French's friendship with our\nMinisters. It therefore seemed probable that this Mr. French would\nin those days have been intimate with his young minister, Mr.\nBeard, and that he might be the Fr named in one of the\ntests of the sitting of January 6th.\nThe results of the inquiries made by Mr. Thomas into the\ntests and clues were stated by him as follows :\nThe initial message on January 6th, 1922, was\n:\nSomething about one who passed quite lately, it is one whom\nthey have been helping and who went rather quickly.\nYour Father is very serious about this, as if he wishes\nto be careful. Why does he give \" M \" ? He keeps\ngiving \" M,\" and yet Feda does not feel as if it is the\nperson's name, though it would connect very closely.\nThis initial suggests Miss Beard's name, Mary. She had been\nin attendance on her father since leaving school, and has been\nhis one companion during the five years since Mrs. Beard\npassed.\nThey speak of being surprised at the passing, as if it took\nthem by surprise. It is one whom they thought could\nstill do something on earth. It looked like being prema-\nture, but Etta shakes her head and says \"It is all right.\"\nFr , Fra , Feda cannot get the name, but it is\nmixed up in a newspaper test purposely in case he failed\nto give it clearly this way.\nThat they were correct in thinking Mr. Beard might have done\nfurther work, and that his passing took them rather by surjsrise,\nmay be gathered from the fact that he had been preaching\nduring the previous quarter and had promised to do so again in\nthree months' time, but asked to be given no appointments\nmeanwhile as he was unwell.\n\" Fr , Fra \" ; this appears to be an attempt for the\nname French which was found in the next day's Morning Post\n(see below).\n\f126 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, 1926\nThen at 2.45 p.m. on the same day, January 6th, came the\nseries of tests relating to the Times and Morning Post for\nthe following day, January 7th, of which a copy was posted to\nthe S.P.R. on the 6th\n:\nTimes to-morrow, page one, column two, upper half but not\nquite top, say one quarter down. Name of the j)erson\npassed recently, not sure if Christian name or not.\nTwo inches from the top of this second column on the first\npage of the Times appears the name Samuel. This is Mr. Beard's\nChristian name.\nClose to is another name, not his own, but of place this\nperson was very much connected with.\nIn the same advertisement with Samuel and on the line im-\nmediately above it is Weston-super-Mare. In this town Mr.\nBeard worked for three years. Also, a few lines higher, appears\nSomerset, in which County he lived for six years, and was colleague\nsuccessively with my father and my uncle.\nThis person will be missed. Sudden passing, but unsatis-\nfactory health previously; some additional physical trouble\nled to the climax, then quickly over.\nMr. Beard was certainly missed, both by his only daughter who\nhad been his constant companion and who was now left alone,\nher only brother being stationed abroad and her mother having\npredeceased her father, and by the Wesleyan Churches in and\naround Tunbridge Wells, where he had for some twenty years\nrendered much assistance. The references to health are correct;\nMiss Beard had noticed a change in her father after their return\nfrom holidays the previous year, and it was then discovered\nthat he had an internal trouble for which an operation was\nadvised. This internal condition greatly aggravated the throat\ntrouble which had compelled his retirement so long previously\nas 1895. His illness lasted two weeks, and during his last two\ndays the condition of the throat was both painful and serious\n;\nso much so that he was given injections of morphia. It is per-\nfectly correct to say that the internal trouble supervening upon\nthe previous throat condition led to a climax and that the end\nwas quick. , . .\nAn appointment made with the person, important affecting\nothers, could not be carried out owing to the passing.\n\fOctober, 1926 Three Neivspaper Tests 127\nThe operation had been fixed to take place on January 5th,\nin a London nursing home; but as the day approached he was\ntoo ill to be moved, and was in fact dying.\nColumn one, nearly half way down, find name of a near\nrelative, living, of the above. \" J \" is given as a name\nconnected with the one passed and is to be found close\nto that of the near relative.\nWithin one inch of half way down column one is Mary, the\nname of his daughter. \"An initial J\" is in the same advertise-\nment with Mary. Mr. Beard had two brothers both of whose\nnames commence with \"J.\"\n\" B \" is given ; Feda feels sure it is to be linked with the\none passed over.\nThere seems little doubt that this refers to the surname. Beard.\nA reference to the place he was shortly going to is made\nnear the bottom of column one.\nThe operation was to have been in London. While there are\nseveral town addresses within four inches of the bottom of this\ncolumn the word London only appears once, and its position is\n^ihe third line from the bottom of column one.\nMorning Post to-morrow. He thinks this was from the\nback page, left side and one quarter down ; a name re-\nferring to the same man lately passed, as given in the\nTimes test. Got idea re Ships close thereto.\nExactly one quarter down the first left hand column of the\nlast page of the Morning Post is the word French. The test\nmessage is not quite explicit as to which person the name would\nfit, but there had been a preliminary attempt to give a name\n\" J'r ,\" and, when the attempt failed, it was stated that the\nname would be introduced amid the paper tests for the day. I\ntherefore conclude that this was an attempt to indicate the old\nTaunton friend, Mr. French. Miss Beard recollects that her\nfather used to speak of that family.\n\" Ships.\" The line immediately followed that containing the\nabove name French, ends with the word Port, which perhaps,\nby mental association, suggested ships. This syllable comes at\nthe end of a line and is continued on the next, being part of an\n.address, Portland Road.\n\f128 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, 1926\nPage 5 : find name of a place, half way down left side, also\nmentioned in Times test.\nThis is unsatisfactory inasmuch as no name appears there which\nhad been previously alluded to. It may be a complete failure.^\nIt is curious, however, that three inches below the halfway crease\nof the first column at the left side of page 5 there should be\nfound the word Avalon. Avalon is the old, but still used name,\nfor Glastonbury, a place at which Mr. Beard, would have frequently\ncondacted services while he was my uncle's colleague in Somerset.\nIn giving this item the \" sensing \" or the transmission may have\nbeen faulty.\nMr. Thomas then reports some further remarks made by\nFeda at the sitting of January 6th, of which a resume may be\ngiven, as follows :\n(a) The one passed over belonged, to different conditions,\nthings which interested other people . . . not like those who-\ninterest themselves in their homes.\nTills would apply to any Wesleyan Minister, but especially to\none like Mr. Beard who had travelled in many Circuits. Mr.\nBeard also had other interests, such as the study of natural\nhistory and geology.\n(6) Keference was made to \" a lot of papers,\" and it was indi-\ncated that there would be \" something about this that will be\nposthumous.\"\nMr. Thomas suggests that this refers to an Obituary Notice.\nIt is the custom amongst Wesleyans, he says, \" to present to the\nMay Synod a comprehensive account of the life and work of any\nminister deceased since the previous Conference. . . . Mr. Beard's\nObituary was published the following September, and may be read\non p. 113 of the Wesleyan Minutes of Conference for 1922.\n(c) Eeference was made to \" talking of going away a little\nwhile ago. . . . Feda keeps getting the idea of going to another\nplace.\" Miss Beard remarks respecting this that there had been\noccasional conversation as to their next holiday, and that Folke-\nstone had been decided on. She had from time to time introduced\n^The causes of the failures are puzzling problems. Perhaps the examina-\ntion of a number of instances and the consideration of the communicators'\nexplanations might throw some light on the process employed in the tests..\nA. W. T.\n\fOctober, 1926 Three Newspaper Tests 129\nthe subject of his next holiday in order to cheer her father when he\nwas unwell.\n(d) It was said that the person concerned \" was connected with\na paper-test before.\" This statement was voluntarily corrected at\nthe next sitting, when it was said that the previous allusion was\nnot in a paper-test. Mr. Thomas has not been able to trace any\nsuch reference to Mr. Beard.\nAfter seeing the notice of Mr. Beard's death in the Methodist\nRecorder Mr. Thomas at his next sitting, on January 20th,\n1922, put some questions \" in order to discover whether I\ncould elicit further clues to the subject of the tests of January\n7th.\" The upshot of these questions may be summed up\nfrom Mr. Thomas's record, as follows :\n(a) The test of January 6th is \" not to do with the astral\nvisitor\" (Strevett), \"nor the one before that\" (Ray). [See below.]\n(6)\n\" Not a relation,\" said Peda, \" not one you would have seen\njust previously to his passing, but you heard about him from\npeople with whom you come in contact. Feda gets the idea of a\ngroup of people who will know about him at once . . . B. con-\nnected with him.\nThe group of people among whom he was fairly well known\nand who would at once hear of his passing would be those of\nthe Tunbridge Wells Circuit.\n(c) Mr. Thomas asked the following question :\n\" Was he a Wes-\nleyan Minister near to whom Father once lived ?\n\"\nThis question was due to a misconception on Mr. Thomas's\npart, but led to a reply of some interest to the effect that his\nfather \" was in touch with him twice with an interval between,\"\nand that Mr. Thomas's mother would know of this. On this\nstatement Mr. Thomas comments thus :\nThe first time of contact would be when they worked together\nin Taunton ; a few years later Mr. Beard was working as\na colleague with my uncle in the Shepton Mallett Circuit,\nand my father doubtless met him there when visiting my\nuncle. My mother and aunt, though remembering Mr.\nBeard in those distant days very distinctly, cannot vouch\nfor any specific visits during which my father and Mr.\nBeard would have met after the interval.\n\f130 Journal of Society for Fsycldcal Research Octobek, 1926\n{d) In reply to a direct question it was stated that the man\nconcerned in the test was Mr. Beard.\nMr. Thomas has written the following report of a later\nsitting, with the accompanying comments :\nThe Rev. Samuel W. Beard passed away at 1.30 a.m. on January\n1th, 1922, some eight hours after the close of the first sitting in\nwhich he was described as \" passed quite recently\" and very\nrecently indeed.\"\nIn reply to my inquiry as to her father's condition during the\nday or two preceding his death, Miss Beard informed me that he\nwas then suffering so greatly that the Doctor injected morphia,\nwith the result that her father passed those hours in unconscious-\nness ; as soon as consciousness showed signs of returning he was\nagain put to sleep.\nSome weeks later, and after I had completed the above verifica-\ntions, namely, at a sitting on March 17th, 1922, the following\n<:onversation took place :\nQ. About Mr. Beard ; there was some ambiguity as to the\ndate of his passing, for he only died eight hours after\nyou gave me the tests about him.\nA. We had the information from him.\nQ. What was he doing at the time ?\nA. Moving about as Etta or I, he was having a free and\nindependent existence apart from his physical body.\nQ. And you were not clear if he had left his body or\nnot ?\nA. I certainly thought he had left it.\nQ. You had no cause for uncertainty ?\nA. No ;\nmany spirits have left the body before physical\ndeath, but, as a rule, it is only when there has been\na slow breaking up of physical concUtions.\nQ. It seemed significant that you should have followed your\ntests and remarks about him by reiminding me of\nStrevett's coming, and then saying that what had\nhappened then might happen again ; and that when I\ninquired if this was a case in point you asked me not\nto press. Did you think that he was then finally\nreleased from his body ?\n\fOctober, 1926 Three Newspaper Tests 131\nA. I had no doubt about it at the time of getting the\ninformation from him ; but certainly had a glimmering\nafterwards.\nQ. By \" afterwards \" do you mean when giving me the tests\nabout him at the sitting ?\nA. Yes ;\nyou will see by many things I have done that\nI give better information after a thing is apparently\ndone with.\nQ. Do you get more information then ?\nA. No ; it is merely a growth of knowledge. If I found\nmyself on earth in a strange place, I should not im-\nmediately know the place, nor where I was, but after\nidentifying myself with it for a little while I should\nhave a better knowledge. I identified myself with the\ntrue facts more during the sitting. Can you see that 1\nQ. You mean that as you spoke about him you realised\nmore ?\nA. Do not say \" realised,\" but suspected. I have often\nmet people both on my own plane and on yours,\nspirits whom at first I took to be permanently separated\nfrom their bodies. By closer touch I should sense, or\nfeel, if they were finally separated. I had not been\nin very close touch with Mr. Beard, but got into touch,\nsensing him as it were, during the sitting. There is\na reason for so many errors made by mediums during\nthe war ;\nthey were not sure which and hurriedly\njumped to conclusions.\nDo not be surprised if that happens again ; you see\nI shall watch more for it now, and if possible I will\nbring it about. Should you suspect that I am doing\nthis, do not ask definite questions about it ; it is better\nnot.\nI then asked whether there was anything further which Miss\nBeard might be glad to know. The reply was that, on awaking\nthere, Mr. Beard had expressed a wish to see \" someone whose\nname,\" said Feda, \" commences with '\nE,' and also another person\nwhose name sounds to Feda like Winnie.\"\nOn being informed of this Miss Beard remarked that her father's\nsister was named Elizabeth, and that he had been es2Deeially\n\f132 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, 1926\nattached to his brother Willie. Both Elizabeth and Willie had\npassed some years before.\nIn view of the illuminating error by which my communicator\nmistook Mr. Beard's condition\u2014thinking him to be already a\nresident in the higher realms, whereas his physical body lay under\nthe influence of anaesthetics, and did not die until several hours\nlater\u2014the quotations given below receive peculiar significance.\nTheir dates indicate that they were given four years and two\nyears respectively before the Beard incident. Indeed I had quite\nforgotten their existence, and only discovered them in May 1926,\nwhen searching through my notes of earlier sittings at Mr. Tre-\nthewy's request.\nThey show very clearly that my communicator was aware of\nthe possibility of iust that mistake Avhich he came to make in\nhis first references to Mr. Beard's passing.\nSittincj of April SOth, 1918.\nFeda remarked that my father had recently met in the spirit\nworld some youths in whom I was interested, and added :\nAbout one of them he was at first doubtful as to whether\nor not the lad had finally passed over ; because it is\nsometimes difficult to distinguish between our newly arrived\nand those who are over temporarily during sleep or while\nunder anaesthetics. He has seen these temporary visitors\nlooking so developed that they might have been taken for\nthe ordinary inhabitants. Of course they do not all\nappear so familiar.\nSitfinfj of May 21s\/, 1920.\nIn this sitting allusion was made to visits paid to the spirit\nrealms by some persons during their sleep ; I thereupon inquired\nwhether these temporary visitors seemed as fully alert as those\nliving there permanently. My father, who was controlling,\nreplied\n:\nThere is a difference perceptible to those who know them well.\nThe cord of etheric matter which still connects them with\ntheir sleeping body is drawn from their psychic body ; it\ntherefore follows that a sleep-visitor is limited by the loss\nof this cord substance which is connecting him with the\nbody. Supposing I saw someone who was only temporarily\n\fOctober, 1926. Three Newspaper Tests 133\nout of the body, I might not know whether his modified\nbrightness was, or was not, his usual appearance. For\namong ourselves there are degrees of brightness, since some\nvibrate more keenly with life.\nI then asked whether he would be certain to distinguish, in\nthe case of his own relations, whether or not they had come over\nfinally. He said\n:\nIf long enough with them I should know, but I might not\nknow if I only saw them in passing. There have been\ncases where relations were spoken to by those who were\nunaware that the man or woman had come over finally.\nIn the S.P.R. Journal, May 1923, Dr. F. C. S. Schiller con-\ntributes a remarkable instance of apparent communication through\na medium by a person living, but suffering from senile dementia.\nHis suggestive remarks upon the case include the following\n{p. 91)\n:\nIt would seem that our conscious personality, i.e. what is\ntraditionally called \" our soul,\" is not so strictly tied down\nin its manifestations to its \" body,\" nor so completely and\nadequately represented by its behaviour, as it is natural,\nand hence scientifically \" orthodox \" to suppose. The\nbodily machine may become disordered in ways which\nirresistibly suggest that the soul \" is destroyed or deranged ;\nbut they do not prove this, and all the time it may be\nleading a life of its own in another \" sphere,\"' or on another\n' plane,\" though it cannot express this life through a body\nwhich is no longer its possession in any effective sense. . . .\nIt was always a possibility that bodily functioning did not\nproduce the activities of mind but only conditioned their\nmanifestations, forming the vehicle or machine through\nwhich they were transmitted. As a logical possibility this\nsuggestion had great merits\u2014it could not, e.g. conceivably\nbe disposed of by any of the facts to which materialism\nwas wont to appeal : but it had to remain merely a\ntheoretic possibility in default of positive evidence in favour\nof its interpretation. Now we seem to have got the re-\nquisite evidence. For we seem in this case to catch a\nglimpse not only of the actual correctness of the \" trans-\n\f134: Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, 1926\nmission \" theory of mind, but also of the real spiritual\nagencies which are operating behind and through the veil\nof material mechanisms.\nThere are many instances in which persons are alleged to\nhave functioned on another plane of existence while still in\nthe physical body. Stainton Moses' visions are cases in point.\nHis \" controls \" and other authorities have said that under\nsuch conditions, which usually occur in a state of physical\nunconsciousness, the aetheric or astral body is attached to the\ncarnal body by a thread of light. That people still on the\nearth plane should confuse persons in this form with those\nwho have already passed is quite intelligible, but there are\nfew if any instances of similar mistakes being admitted by\nspirit communicators who allege that they have themselves\nfinally passed to the other side.\nThough no single newspaper test was conclusive and the\nclues were rather vague, the number of coincidences seems to\nbe outside the scope of chance. The cumulative effects of\nthe points of resemblance makes out a strong case for the\nidentity of Samuel Beard with the person indicated by the\ncommunicator. It is really marvellous that so much informa-\ntion could be given of facts unknown to the mediu.m or sitter,\naccompanied with the predictive element involved in the news-\npaper tests. The most plausible theory appears to be the\nspiritistic one that the information came from the sitter's\nfather, to whom it was known and that he devised the news-\npaper tests. The alternative is to fall back upon some such\nhypothesis as the existence of an akashic record, or the possi-\nbility of telepathic communications from unknown sources.\nI believe that the method of newspaper tests is similar to that\nof book-tests, and that, as in the case of Stainton Moses, both\nin the matter of book-tests and of evidential information\napparently coming from a printed source, the medium's clair-\nvoyance (for the want of a better term), is used for the\npurpose under the guidance of external agency. As to how\nthe newspaper sheet is glimpsed before it is in physical exist-\nence I refrain from speculating, because I can find no reason-\nable basis for an explanation.\n\fOctober, 1926 Three Newspaper Tests 135\nIII. The Ray Case.\nOf this case Mr. Thomas gives the following account\n:\nDuring a sitting with Mrs. Osborne Leonard on December\n20th, 1921, references were given at 11.54 a.m. to be verified in\nthe morrow's Times. These were posted to the S.P.R. immediately\nafter the sitting in accordance with my invariable custom. Among\nthem was the following : I was asked to look in column one of\nthe first page and there find, \" about half way down, the name\nof a man very recently passed over about whom 3-ou have been\ntalking lately.\"\nI did not know to whom this might refer, but heard that\nevening of the death of Mr. Ray, one of our members at the\nLeysian Mission. Some months previously he had sent for me\nto visit him in hospital, and I had since then frequently discussed\nhis chances of recovery with my colleague who was his regular\nvisitor. It therefore seemed to me that the name Eay, if found\nat the given place in the morrow's Times, would perfectly meet\nthe test.\nThe name appeared there in a marriage notice, Francis Ray,\nand was placed less than two inches below the half-way crease\nin column one. Moreover, this notice had not been present in\nthe previous day's issue.\nThis incident impressed me as additional evidence following\nmuch of a similar character, showing how closely the communicator\nwas able to follow my work at the Mission. Ray had died eight\ndays before my sitting ; the conversation regarding him had\nalways been in private.\nFollowing the above Times test was an attempt to get one on\nsimilar lines from the Morning Post.\nMorning Post; re the man passed over quite recently, there\nis a name in column three, near the top ; the same name\nas in the Times. Also another name of his a little lower\ndown. The name James seemed to come strongly and\nclose to the above.\nAlthough there were syllables containing the required sound,\nsuch as Rai, in the word rails, it cannot be said this part of the\nexperiment was successful. Yet it is significant that Mr. Ray's\n\f136 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, 1926\nChristian name was James, a fact of which I was unaware until\nseveral days after this sitting.\nIt is not stated whence the communicators obtained their\nknowledge of Ray's death, but the meaning appears to be\neither that Ray's spirit was present at the seance, or more\nprobably that they (the father and sister of Mr. Thomas)\nknew from their own observation that he had passed. The\ncase would then be similar to that of Beard, except that\nRay had really passed and was not dying, as Beard was w^hen\nsupposed to have passed. In other words, the external agency\nof the communicators must be postulated. There is an\nalternative theory : Strevett's case being taken at its face\n.value, we may assume that a similar rapport existed betw^een\nMr. Thomas and Ray, resulting in Mr. Thomas being sub-\nconsciously aware of Ray's death, and his knowledge being\nthus available to Feda, who thereby appreciated the import-\nance of the presence of Ray's name in the Times. She was\neither looking for some word bearing on Ray's identity or\nfinding such a word thought of Ray's death as a suitable\nobject for a test. That the initiative came from the com-\nmunicators seems on the whole to be the more plausible\nexplanation. The Times nev\/spaper test in this case is very\naj^propriate, and is a strildng instance of what can be achieved\nunder favourable conditions.\nOf course it is not safe to conclude that because two cases\nappear similar the same methods were used in both. These\nthree cases seem to be connected with each other and to form\npart of a programme. It is curious that any two of them\nmay be put in the same class from one point of view and\ndistinguished from the third. If they are considered together\nthey to some extent support each other, for a weak point in\none is a strong point in another e.g. the newspaper tests are\nnot so conclusive in Beard's case as in Ray's, and the incep-\ntion of Strevett's case is not so satisfactory as the foundations\nof Beard's and Ray's. Comparing them together one feels\nthat a weakness may be due to accident or lack of material\nand that one cannot always expect a perfectly water-tight\nstructure.\n\fOctober, 102fi Corres2Jondence 137\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nFURTHER STATEMENT CONCERNING \"A SUPPOSED\nPREMONITORY IMPRESSION.\"\nTo the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.\nTravellers' Club,\nLondon, September, 1926.\nMadam,\u2014The letter on the case of prevision which was printed\nin the Journal of July (Vol. 2.3, p. 118) does not accurately\nrepresent the facts as known to me, and I should be obliged if you\nwould give nie the opportunity of nuiking the following corrections.\n(1) Mr. Hobson states that I sent a telegram to warn the\nmanager that a fall of rock was impending. I uientioned nothing\nabout a fall of rock. When my telegram was sent (\" to stop the\nmen working immediately I only knew that the men were in\ngreat danger where they were working. I did not know what\nform the danger took until next morning, when I received three\ntelegrams to let me know what had happened shortly after I had\nsent the telegram.\nMr. Hobson implies that I knew all about quarry operations\nfrom my boyhood. That statement is also incorrect. My father\nand I lived about ten miles from the quarries, which were worked\nby a local manager. My father was over forty years of age\nwhen he first had an interest in the quarries, which he visited\nfrom time to time to consult with the manager ; but neither my\nfather nor I had any technical knowledge of quarrying, and in\nmy early days I rarely visited the quarries. If the quarrymen\nwho were working on the ground, and who had known it from\nchildhood, and the agent, saw no indications of danger, how\nshould I ?\n(3) When I motored back from the quarry with my brother\nhe told me of a \"shoot\" he had been to. I was interested, and\nwhile listening to him the \" message \" came that the men were\nin great danger and I should send a wire to the agent to tell\nthem to leave immediately. When I told my brother he said\nthere was no reason and no indication of danger ; but I persisted,\nand at the next Post Office I passed I sent the wire.\n\f138 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, 1926\nWhen I received ttie three telegrams the next morning telling\nme of the landslide I lay on the sofa for an hour, and the\nthought uppermost in ray mind was, if I had been persuaded\nnot to send the telegram what a terrible result would have\nfollowed. But I must disclaim Mr. Hobson's statement that I\nwarned the local manager that a fall of rock was impending.\nI was only aware of some great danger.\nJohn A. A. Williams.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nThe February issue of the new German monthly periodical\nRevalo Bund has a short article by Professor Schafer of Wandsbek,\nwhich deals with some experiments recently conducted in\nattempted \" control \" of a medium by a living person at a\ndistance and by arrangement. One of the results appears to be\nstriking, and a detailed account should be published. Two\nprivate persons took part in the experiment, in addition to the circle\nof observers. One was the daughter of a prominent local official ;\nand the other an officer in the air-force. It was proposed that\nattempts should be made by the officer to \" control \" the female\nmedium from a distance. The officer was told the day and hour\nin which sitting? were held, and the circle awaited results. One\nevening, during the sitting, a sharp rap was heard, and the\nentranced medium immediately sprang up and assumed a military\nbearing. She signified her desire to write, and on a paper block\nwhich was handed to her she wrote in a changed handwriting the\nwords Me-'tnento inoris C. . . . A member of the circle then\nannounced that he had received a letter from the officer stating\nhis intention of being present in spirit at the evening's sitting,\nand enclosing a sealed enve]o])e. On opening the envelope a piece\nof paper was found on which was written the same words as the\nmedium hatl just written herself. It was also stated that the\nwriting was similar to that of the officer.\nThe Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research for\nJune has an interesting article by Dr. Crandon on certain new\nfeatures of the Margery mediumship, in which what is claimed as\nexamples of crypthesthesia are a prominent feature. The case is\nevidently becoming of increasing importance, and recent visitors\n\fOctober, 1926 Notes on Periodicals 139\nof scientific distinction in other fields have been much impressed,\nas one would naturally expect.\nIn the same issue M. Eene Sudre contributes an abstract of a\nlecture recently delivered at the College de France, in which he\nseverely castigates the persons whose doubts concerning the\nintegrity of mediums and the competence of investigators lead\nthem to adopt an attitude of great caution in the field of psychical\nresearch. Thus the present writer is characterised by M. Sudre\nas one who has \" made war against all physical mediums,\" which\nis a grotesque travesty of the truth, and in his treatment of\nGuzik M. Sudre shows that he has but little appreciation of the\nnature of the evidence against that medium. The persons\nchastised with so much Gallic vigour by M. Sudre ask for very\nlittle. Many of them, the writer included, would travel many\nmiles to hear a few supernormal raps. The only condition they\ninsist upon is that these raps should not be such as may be\nproduced normally, and can it be said that this condition is\nunreasonable ? M Sudre is continually deploring the aloof\nattitude of scientific men. \" We would wish,\" he says, \" to have\na scientific audience,\" and all that is demanded is \"a single\neffort of good will.\" Is M. Sudre too ingenuous not to realize\nthat that scientific audience is patiently awaiting a demonstration\nof the \" facts \" proclaimed by their enthusiastic sponsor, but\nunder conditions better than those which appear to M. Sudre so\nperfect, and which he associates so often with the names of\nGuzik, or Kahn ?\nIn the same issue Mr. Bird continues the discussion of Mrs.\nPruden's mediumship, and comes to the wise conclusion that\nnothing more can be done until that lady permits the inquiry to\nbe conducted in such a way that obvious avenues to fraud are\nat least partially closed to her.\nE. J. Dingwall.\n\f140 Journal of Society for Psychical Research octobeb, 1926\nREVIEWS.\nI. \" Margery \" the Medium. By J. Malcolm Bird. Boston : Small*\nMaynard & Co. 1925. Price $4.00.\nThis book is an account of the celebrated \" Margery \" medium-\nship from its commencement up to the date of publication. For\nthe benefit of those of our Members, if there are any, who are\nnot acquainted with the details of the case, it is worth while to\nmention that Margery is the name given to Mrs. Crandon, the\nwife of a well-known Boston surgeon, and that her mediumship\nbegan, as far as this book is concerned, in 1923.\nFor the purposes of this review the book may be considered as\nconsisting of two parts, the first being an account of the various\nsittings and phenomena which took place up to April, 1924, while\nthe second is an account of the investigation by the Committee\nappointed by the Scientific American magazine to examine the\nphenomena of mediums who entered for the prize offered by that\njournal.\nThe phenomena recorded in the five hundred or so pages before\nus form perhaps the most heterogeneous and confusing mass of\nmaterial that has ever been presented to the student. To attempt\nany kind of summary would be hopeless. Almost every phase\nof mediumship that has ever been heard of finds some example\nin this extraordinary case, and the really notable fact which\nemerges from the mass is that we know no more about the\ncausation of such phenomena or their place in a scientific scheme,\nthan we did when the series began. If, as the author argues,\nthe Margery phenomena are genuinely supernormal, this is a\nlamentable confession of failure.\nVarious attempts seem to have been made by different investi-\ngators to secure the production, under test conditions, of some\nsingle phenomenon which could be examined in detail, but in\nevery case before this end was attained the inquiry went off on\nto a new track, and for some reason or other the earlier attempt\nfell through.\nThe reader will thus find, in this part of the book, an immense\nnumber of rather disconnected accounts of alleged supernormal\nevents ; but it will be difficult for him to decide whether their\n\fOCTOBEE, 1926 Reviews 141\nclaim to p;enuineness can be allowed, and, even if it is, they will\ntell him nothing as to their mechanism.\nWith regard to Mr. Bird's accuracy as a reporter, the only case\nin which this can be estimated by us is his account of the sitting\nat the S.P.R. rooms in 1923, in which he describes Mr. \" Fielding\n\"\nas a conjurer, and the table as the celebrated trick table of Mr.\nHarry Price.\" In point of fact Mr. Feilding is not a conjurer,\nand the table is in no sense a trick table and was not designed\nby Mr. Price.\nWhat I have called the second part of the book is an account\nof the investigation by the Scientific American committee, of which\nMr. Bird was secretary from its formation until the close of the\nMargery enquiry, and it is clearly as a criticism of this Committee,\nand as a reply to its adverse report that the book was largely\nwritten. On this side of the Atlantic it is difficult to form any\nopinion as to the rights or wrongs of this dispute. What is\nabundantly clear from Mr. Bird's account is, that the Committee\nwas not a sufficiently united body for the task they had under-\ntaken. The members of it had a tendency to pursue their own\nlines of inquiry, and to formulate their conclusions without a\nsufficiently frank attitude towards one another. This was probably\nan inevitable consequence of the constitution of the Committee,\nbut the fact rendered any satisfactory conclusion impossible.\nFrom the present position of the Margery problem as it is\npresented in this book it is perhaps possible to draw two con-\nclusions. First, that if any progress is to be made it will only be\nby insisting on the continual repetition of one phenomenon, until\nby varying the conditions, some definite knowledge is gained as\nto the nature of the forces at work and their modus operandi.\nSecond, that the group of investigators concerned must be pre-\npared to devote a large amount of time and work to possibly\nmonotonous experiment, and must have complete confidence in\none another.\nV. J. vv.\nII. Fakirs, fumistes et Cie. By Paul Heuze. Pp. v, 211. Paris :\nLes editions de France, 1926.\nThis little book is a discussion of the claims of certain travelling\n\" fakirs,\" such as Tahra Bey and Rahmann Bey, and their relation\n\f142 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, 1926\nto alleged psychic phenomena. The author will be remembered as\none of the promoters of the various schemes for testing the\nclaims of physical mediums in Paris, and in the present volume\nhe applies his strongly developed critical faculty to a considera-\ntion of the travelling fakirs. He shows how their phenomena\ncan be duplicated with a little practice and some pain by anyone,\nand the wrapper shows him with hat-pins thrust through his\nflesh a la Tahra Bey.\nE. J.

CASE.\nAn Attempt to give Infobmation Concerning the\nContents op a Sealed Packet.\nThe following case has come to us from Mr. E. F. Benson^\na Member of the Society, by whom the facts were originally\ncommunicated to Mrs. Sidgwick and to Mr. J. Gr. Piddington^\nIt is a case of an attempt to obtain by supernormal means\ninformation concerning the contents of a sealed packet, this\ninformation being possessed by no living person. So far as\nregards its original purpose the experiment failed, but the\nresult was not without interest in the fact that five persons-\nindependently made statements which seemed to be attempts\nto describe the contents of the packet, and these statements\nagreed with one another, though not with the facts. This,\nsuggests that some telepathic rapport may have been set up\nbetween the various living persons concerned in the experiment,,\nand for that reason the incident is worth recording. The-\nnames of all the persons concerned are known to the Society,\nbut some of them are not given here.\nThe experiment originated in 1918, when Mrs Benson, Mr.\nE. F. Benson's mother, sealed up a packet containing something\nwhich had belonged to her daughter, who had died two years,\nbefore. Mrs. Benson herself died in 1918, and in 1923 Mr..\nE. F. Benson wrote to Mr. Piddington as follows\n:\nAug. 15.23.\n... In consequence of what Mrs. Leonard said, while I was-\nsitting with her, about another packet . . . my mother agreed to-\nprepare Packet B (with which we have to deal). Packet B,.\nwhich has never been opened, is in my possession. All I know of\nits contents is that it contains something which belonged to my\nsister, who died in 1916. The plan was that I should try to\nascertain from some medium what Packet B contained. Up till\nthe time of my mother's death in 1918 I had not done so. As\nfar as I know, therefore, nobody alive has any knowledge of\nwhat Packet B contains. (i) After my mother's death I told\nMrs. A [a personal friend of Mrs. Benson's, see below] the\n\fNovember, 1926 Case\nstory of Packet B, which was then unknown to her. She sat\nwith a friend of hers who does automatic script, and in the\nscript there came out the information of what the packet con-\ntained. I do not know what that information was, because I\nrefused to let Mrs. A tell me. . . .\nE. F. Bensok.\nThe later part of Mr. Benson's letter to Mr. Piddington is\nconcerned with matters which are told in greater detail in a\nsubsequent letter to Mrs. Sidgwick (see below).\nThe next development in the case occurred in June of this\nyear, when Mr. Benson wrote to Mrs. Sidgwick, thus :\nJune 23.26.\nI enclose a half sheet which may perhaps interest you. . . .\nI intend now to open the packet in question, because I don't\nsee how, as a test, the conditions could be improved. For the\nlast eight years, nobody, as far as I know, can have known what\nis in the packet, and if it does contain a lock of hair, or, say,\nthe picture of a lock of hair, or anything of the sort, it is diffi-\ncult to see from where, except from some disearnate source, the\ninformation could have come. . . .\nE. E. Benson.\nWith this letter was enclosed the following statement\n:\nThe substance of this was written on June 17th, 1926, and\ncopied out with two small corrections on June 22nd.\nSome months before my mother's death in 1918 she sealed up\na packet the contents of which, so far as I know, are unknown\nto any one Hving on this earth, and sent it to me with a view\nto my seeing if any medium could, without handbng the packet,\ntell me what was inside it. I could not find a suitable oppor-\ntunity before her death, and the packet, still unopened, is in a\ndrawer of the table in the front ground-floor at 25 Brompton\nSquare.\nAfter my mother's death I told Mrs. A of the existence of\nthe packet, and she consulted three mediums separately who,\npurporting to be in communication with my mother, told her\nwhat the packet contained. They none of them saw or handled\nor were in any way put into connexion with it, but they all\nthree said it contained the same thing. Mrs. A did not tell\n\f146 Journal of Society \/w Psychical MeseaTch November, 1926\nme what this was, but wrote it down and gave it me in a sealed\nenvelope. The idea was that I should independently consult a\nmedium, and therefore had better not know what the others had\nsaid. When two of the mediums had given the same answer,\nbut before the third had been consulted, I sat with Mrs. Cooper\nof the British College of Psychic Science. She professed to learn\nthe contents of the packet (which she said was a flower), but when\nI -bold Mrs. A this, it did not agree with what had been told her.\nLast week, on June 9th, Mrs. A brought here a fresh medium\nMrs. [Barnes] (pseud.). She went into trance, and speaking with\ngreat difficulty called me \" her son Fred.\" She then pulled down\na piece of her hair, and wrapped it round her fingers : she\nrepeated this action twice or three times. On coming to herself\nshe seemed to have no idea what had happened, and before\ngoing into trance had not known that she was being consulted\nabout the packet in question. Mrs. A , as the medium was\ncoming out of trance, told me for the first time what the other\nmediums had said, namely that the packet contained a lock of\nhair. Mrs. A\n\u2014\n\u2014 confirms the correctness of this account.\nE. F. Benson.\nIn reply to some questions put by Mrs. Sidgwick, Mr.\nBenson \\vrote to her again a few days later, as follows :\nJune 2Sth, 26.\n. . . With regard to your first letter (special features), the\nquestions you ask can mostly be only answered by Mrs A .\nI will put them all to her, and get her answers written down\nbefore the packet is opened. There are, however, a few which\nconcern me. (1) The drawer in which the packet has been kept\nwas not locked. . . .\nE. F. Benson.\nIn tlie rest of this letter and in a letter written on July 1st,\nMr. Benson discusses what bearing this fact could have on\nthe experiment. The conclusion lie reaches is that it may be\nregarded as certain that the contents of the packet had not\nbecome known to any one. In view of the result of the\nexperiment this part of the evidence does not seem worth\nrecording in detail. Mr. Benson also sent Mrs. Sidgwick a\nstatement concerning Mrs. A 's replies to questions put to\nher, as follows :\n\fNovember, 1926 Case 147\nQuestions asked Mrs. A hy E. F. B. before the opening of\nthe packet, and her anstvers.\n(1) Did ]\\Irs. A know where the packet was kept ?\nAnsiver. No.\n(2) About what date did E. F. B. mention the existence of it\nto her ?\nAnswer. About 1921.\n(3) What were the names of the mediums who gave the identical\nsolution of the contents of the packet ?\nAnsiver. (i) Mrs. C . She gave it in automatic script in 1921.\n(ii) Mrs. J . She gave it in trance in 1921 or 1922.\n(iii) Name of third doubtful. She gave it in trance\nabout the same time.\n(iv) Mrs. [Cross]. She was not in trance, but said she\nsaw my mother, describing her correctly, stand-\ning by Mrs. A , and holding a lock of hair.\nDate, 1926.\n(Finally Mrs. [Barnes] said nothing about a packet, but in trance\nat Lamb House, Rye, in June, 1926, wound my finger in her\nhair. Nothing was said to her in my presence about my mother.)\n(4) Did any of the mediums know before the sitting that they\nwere to be asked about a sealed packet ?\nAnswer. No. The information concerning a lock of hair\noccurred spontaneously, whether the medium was in trance or\nnot. Mrs. C signed the message as coming from my mother.\n(5) Did any who spoke in trance appear to have any subsequent\nknowledge of what they had said ?\nAnswer. No.\n(6) Did Mrs. A tell them what had happened, or mention\nE. F. B. or his mother ?\nAnsiver. No.\n(7) Did Mrs. A think that any of the mediums were\nacquainted ?\nAnswer. To the best of her knowledge they were not.\nAfter the opening of the sealed packet Mr. Benson ^^Tote\nto Mrs. Sidgwick as follows :\nj^j^ ri\n9q\nThe test was a complete failure, for the packet contained a\nlacquer box, and inside it was a small silver cross and a piece of\na necklace of Egyptian beads ... E. F. Benson.\n\f148 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November, 1926\nAs observed in Mr. Benson's letter the test was a failure,\nso far as concerns the attempt to obtain information not\npossessed by any living mind, and the interest of the case\nlies in the circumstance that five people independently made\nthe same suggestion in regard to the contents of the sealed\npacket. The force of this coincidence is diminished by the\nfact that the suggestion as to a lock of hair was a fairly\nobvious one. On the other hand, there are other obvious\nsuggestions, e.g. the one made by Mrs. Cooper, that the packet\ncontained a flower, and it does not seem likely that chance\nalone would lead as man}^ as five people along the same road.\nThe fact that on all the occasions when a lock of hair was\nmentioned Mrs. A was present, and that on the one occasion\nwhen she was not present, the sitting mth Mrs. Cooper, a\ndifferent solution was offered, suggests that telepathy from Mrs.\nA may have played some part in the result obtained.\nTHE S.P.E. SERIES OF SITTINGS WITH\nMR. GEORGE VALIANTINE.\nReply by Mr. H. Dennis Bradley to Mr. Hereward\nCarrington, and Una, Lady Troubridge.\nI have read Mr. Hereward Carrington's letter in the issue of the\nJournal of the S.P.R. for June, in reference to the Vahantine\nsittings. I have also read the reply by Una, Lady Troubridge.\nMr. Hereward Carrington naturally endeavours to defend his\nposition as a member of the Scientific American Committee.\nThe findings of that Committee, published in their Report of\nJuly 1923, upon the three sittings held ^vith George Valiantine,\nwere based upon a determined assumption of fraud. My analysis\nof this Report in Towards the Stars was scientifically critical,\nand those findings were proved to be illogical and groundless.\nDuring 1925 a further series of sixty-one experiments took\nplace under the mediumship of Valiantine. These sittings were\nattended by one hundred and twenty-two persons. This series,\nat which luminous trumpets were mtroduced, was even more\nsuccessful and evidential than that of 1924. The complete details\n\fl^ovEMBEK, 1926 Sittings with Mr. George Valiantine 149\nare published in The Wisdom of the Gods, whicli Mr. Carrington\ndoes not appear to have read.\nIn his comments on Lady Troubridge's report of the Valiantine\nsittings Mr. Carrington says :\n\" It is unfortunate therefore, that\non the only occasion when she thought she heard the medium's\nvoice at the same time as the '\nindependent voice,' other sitters\nin the circle failed to do so. . .\n.\"\nThis is inaccurate. Simultaneous voices were heard not only\nby Una, Lady Troubridge, but by Mrs. Bradley, by myself and\nby Mr. Hannen Swafier, and, on a subsequent occasion, at that\nsame sitting, when the two voices were again heard speaking\nsimultaneously, every sitter in the circle heard it. (See p. 298 of\nThe Wisdom of the Gods.)\nMr. Carrington's naive blundering reaches its height in his .\nprimitive explanation of the methods by which the medium is\nsupposed (by him) to produce the voices. He gives a series of\ncurious manoeuvres which a fraudulent medium is supposed to\nperform with the trumpet, adding, mysteriously and significantly,\nin the dark,\" and ignorant that in the Valiantine sittings two\nluminous trumpets were used, and that these manoeuvres were\nimpossible without instant detection.\nMr. Carrington is incorrect in his statement of the conditions\nof the Valiantine tests. Nor are his mis-statements confined to\n-one aspect of the case. Even Una, Lady Troubridge, finds it\nnecessary to repudiate some of his suggestions. (P. 90, Journal\n.S.P.R., June 1926.)\nMr. Carrington would seem to have a high opinion of his own\npowers as a fraudulent medium, and boasts of his performance\nin the light, performances as to the possibility of which, however,\nLady Troubridge would appear to be dubious. He is apparently\nignorant of the conditions of these daylight sittings. Far be it\nfrom me to question Mr. Carrington' s powers of imposition, but\nI may be permitted to doubt his capacity for carrying on intelli-\ngent conversations in half a dozen languages, under any con-\nditions, light or dark.\nIt is impossible to understand the attitude now taken by Lady\nTroubridge, in view of the report she gave in the Proceedings\nof the S.P.R., and in view of the many statements which she\nmade before witnesses during the series of the Valiantine sittings.\n\f150 Journal of Society for Fsijchiccd Re^eavclt Novembeh, 1926\nLady Troubridge now says (June 1926), \" I agree with almost\neverything Mr. Carrington says\/' This is tantamount to saying\nthat she agrees with the assumption of Mr. Carrington \" that\nValiantine's phenomena are easily explicable, and that fraud\nalone will serve to account for all the alleged manifestations-\nproduced through his '\nmediumship.\"\n\"\nHow is it possible for Lady Troubridge to reconcile this assump-\ntion with her report of January 1926 (Part 97, Proc. S.P.R.,.\npage 55) :\n\" We think it only fair to Valiantine to say that,\napart from any evidential value lying in the utterances of the-\nvoices, we feel that the total phenomena produced at this sitting\nwere beyond what could have been obtained by the fraudulent\nefforts of the medium unaided by any accomplice 1\nLady Troubridge now refers to \" the conditions imposed by Mr-\nBradley\u2014total darkness, no control of the medium, and a general\natmosphere of antagonism to any test being required.\"\nIt is remarkable that she should now make such an objection,,\nsince the entire object of these sittings was to obtain mental\nevidence, and the question of controlling the medium was never-\nraised. The sittings were not held in total darkness, since the\ntwo luminous trumpets or megaphones were brightly luminous,,\nand were both clearly discernible, so that every movement and\nevery angle could be observed by all the sitters.\nLady Troubridge's present objections are in entire contradiction.'\nof the facts of the case.\nOn Thursday, March 13th, 1925, Lady Troubridge and Miss\nRadclyffe-Hall had their first sitting at Dorincourt, under-\nValiantine's mediumship.\nOn this occasion Valiantine was not introduced to either Ladjr\nTroubridge or Miss Radclyfie-Hall. nor did he see their faces until\nwe walked into the study, when the lights were switched off\nafter a few seconds.\nDuring the sitting three different \" voices \" came through,\ngiving their Christian names and surnames, and speaking to both\nLady Troubridge and Miss Radclyffe-Hall. Lady Troubridge\nasked one of the spirit voices to give through the name of her\ndaughter ; the name was volunteered by the voice, a most un-\nusual name as Lady Troubridge herself states.\nIn her letter of June 1926 Lady Troubridge states :\n\" Mr\u201e\n\fNovember, 1926 Sittings with Mr. George Valiantine 151\nBradley introduces his sitters by name ; in many cases there are\npreliminary dinner-parties at which the medium is introduced to\nall the company, and is able, should he wish it, to glean such\ninformation as Mr. Bradley and his household may have failed\nto supply.\" This statement is entirely untrue. At the great\nmajority of the Valiantine series of sittings none of the sitters\nwas introduced to Valiantine. It was only on a few occasions\nwith guests who were staying in my house during week-ends,\nwhen it Avas impossible to avoid introductions, that this method\nwas adopted.' On each of these occasions I have been careful,\nto state, in my book, that the sitters were introduced.\nI have used meticulous care in recording faithfidly every in-\ncident, and I resent the innuendo made by Lady Troubridge in\nher statement that \" Valiantine's position as a guest in the house-\nhold, including Mr. and Mrs. Bradley, their son and servants,\nand a younger son of eight years old, offers unlimited oppor-\ntunities for the acquisition of useful data anent prospective\nsitters.\"\nOn Monday, March 16th, 1925, Lady Troubridge and Miss\nRadclyffe-Hall again sat at Dorincourt under the mediumship of\nValiantine. Dr. Woolley was also present. On this occasion,\nthree different spirit voices again spoke to Lady Troubridge and\nMiss Radclyffe-Hall, each voice announcing itself by name.\nAt the time when Valiantine was speaking simultaneously with\nDr. Barnett, and the two voices were heard by all speaking to-\ngether, Lady Troubridge immediately volunteered the statement :\n\" I wish to state that the medium was speaking at the same time\nas Dr. Barnett.\" (See Proc, Part 97, p. 61.)\nThe sitting which took place at 6.30 p.m. at Dorincourt on\nMarch 21st, 1925, was a negative one. A mistake was made\nwith regard to a \" Feda \" communication in reference to Miss\nWalker. It was far more my mistake than that of the com-\nmunicant, and, quoting from Lady Troubridge's Report of this\nsitting (p. 64-75, Part 97, Proc. of the S.P.R.), the voice of \" Feda \"\nsaid :\n\" Raymond is here and wants to speak with Miss Walker,\"\nand, again, \" Raymond has come to give a message to Miss\nWalker.\" Later :\n\" Raymond is here and he wanted to speak\nto Miss Walker.\" Both the voice of \" Feda \" and the voice of\n\" Dr. Barnett \" said that the mistake was ours and that the circle-,\nhad misunderstood.\n\f152 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November. 1926\nAfter this incident \"\"\nFeda \" continued talking to me for some\ntwo or three minutes ;\nimpressing upon me and insisting that she\n.had not made a mistake.\nSome few weeks after this sitting Lady Troubridge informed me,\nat a P.B.N. Club Dinner (I believe the date was April 7th),\nthat at a sitting with Mrs. Osborne Leonard Feda \" told her\nthat she had not made a mistake on the evening in question.\nLady Troubridge then told \" Feda \" that \" rather than there\n-should he any possibility of a mistake being made it ivould be\nbetter if Feda did not endeavour to get through at these voice seances\nagain.\nHoiv does Lady Troubridge account for this obvious instance of\ncross-confirmation of evidence of identity obtained through the tivo\ndijferent meditims\u2014George Yaliantine and Mrs. Osborne Leonard ?\nLady Troubridge states that at the Valiantine sittings, Feda,\nin the direct voice, speaks with a Yankee accent and vocabulary.\n\" Feda \" does not talk with a Yankee accent. She speaks with\na peculiar accent, which is definitely characteristic, and which\nnever varies. Lady Troubridge has never heard \" Feda \" speak\nin the direct voice.\nLady Troubridge has ofiered the opinion that it was quite\npossible it was not \" Feda \" at all\u2014and that it might, be an\nentity impersonating \" Feda.\" This contention cannot possibly\nbe accepted, as \" Feda \" has been through on dozens of occasions,\nspeaking in a characteristic manner, both at the Valiantine\nsittings and at the \" direct [voice \" sittings held under my own\nand my wife's mediumship. She has an unmistakable personality,\nand, in addition to this, I have a remarkable accumulation of\n-cross evidence through Feda \" in the direct voice, confirmed by\nsittings with Mrs. Osborne Leonard when \" Feda \" has spoken\nthrough Mrs. Leonard in her trance condition. Mrs. Osborne\nLeonard herself has spoken with Feda at length at the direct\nvoice seances held at Dorincourt. We all know Feda \" and\n\u2022every intonation of her voice.\nDuring this series of Valiantine sittings both Lady Troubridge\nand Miss Radclyfie-Hall received several evidential utterances\ngiven to them in the direct voice of communicants known to them.\nI would particularly refer to pp. 57-58 of Lady Troubridge's\nEeport {Proc, Part 97).\n\f-November, 1926 Sittings loith Mr. George Valiantiiie 153\nMany other evidential communications are also to be found in\nLady Troubridge's report. In her letter of June 1926 Lady\nTroubridge ignores these, and refers only to what she now, for\nthe first time, calls \" definite mistakes.\" These \" mistakes \" on\nanalysis, prove to be :\n(1) Mrs. Eastman (pseudonym), expressing afiection for her.\n(Lady Troubridge.)\nThis however, is quite a usual occurrence at \" direct voice\n\"\n.sittings, when personal spirits address sitters when known to them.\n(2) Alfred Henvood (pseudonym), claiming acquaintance with Miss\nE,adclyffe-Hall.\nThe voice of Alfred Henvood did not claim to have known Miss\nRadclyfie-Hall [in life, but it is perfectly logical and, indeed,\n\u2022obviously true, for him to claim her acquaintance at this sitting.\n(3)\n' Our (Lady Troubridge and Miss Radclyffe-Hall) being still\n.at Sterling Street.\"\nThis occurred at a daylight sitting {Proc. S.P.R., Part 97,\np. 71) when, according to Lady Troubridge's own report, which\nI quote :\n\" The voice said :\n'\nI wish X. . . . (her daughter) would come\nhere,' and ' sent love to her.\" It added that the\nspeaker was comiug home with me and had often been\nwith me in Sterling Street.\"\nIt must be noted carefully that the voice did not, according\nto Lady Troubridge, say anything whatever about her and Miss\nEadclyfie-Hall being still at Sterling Street. According to Lady\nTroubridge's report the voice said she had often been there.\nSince Mrs. Eastman's daughter had \\-isited Lady Troubridge at\nSterling Street, after her mother's death, there is no mistake\nwhatever, that the voice of Mrs. Eastman made such a statement,\nand it may be indeed taken as an evidential utterance.\n^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^\nThe attitude adopted by Lady Troubridge in her letter of\nJune 1926, published fifteen months after the incident occurred,\nis curiously contradictory to the attitude adopted by her during\nthese sittings ; in her Report of January 1926, and in all the\n-Statements she made before witnesses at the time.\nLady Troubridge concludes her present letter by saying : \"To\nsum up ; the obvious and flagrant inaccuracies contained in the\nutterances, which put them entirely out of the court \" as\n\f154 Journal of Society for PsycJdcal Research November, 1926\ngenuine psychic communications, justify the deepest suspicion\nregarding the means employed in their production.\"\nIt is inconceivable that Lady Troubridge should now make\nsuch a grave assertion, after having said on March 23rd, 1925,\nin the presence of witnesses, \" I consider this establishes Valian-\ntine in an exceptional way.\" Which statement does Lady Trou-\nbridge wish us to believe ?\nMr. Carrington appears not to have troubled to read the\nevidences of the various daylight sittings held under the medium-\nship of Mr. Valiantine, full details of which were published in\nvarious chapters of The }\u00a5isdom of the Gods. At all of these\nValiantine was under complete observation. Remarkable evidence\nwas given to various of the sitters by spirit voices.\nUpon Mr. Carrington's assumptions, apart from the extra-\nordinary physical phenomena, Valiantine would have to possess\nthe ability to speak in cultured French, German, Italian, Spanish,\nRussian, the Swiss and Basque dialects, Japanese, Chinese, and\nidiomatic Welsh. In addition, he would also have had to acquire,,\nby some inconceivable means, innumerable intimate private details,\nof various personal spirits who have spoken to between two and\nthree hundred difierent people during the series of sittings re-\ncorded in my books. He would also have to be able to speak\nwith fluency and knowledge upon art, literature, science, medicine\nand philosophy. In addition to being a genius iu learning, he\nwould also be the finest actor the Avorlcl has ever seen. He\nwould have to impersonate all types of characters, men, women\nand children, and, additionally, he would need to be, on the\nphysical side, a brilliant conjuror and a super-human acrobat.\nFurther Reply by Dr. Carrington and Lady Troubridge\nA word or two in reply to Mr. Bradley, concerning those parts\nof his paper which refer to myself. I do not agree that Mr.\nBradley's criticism of the findings of the \" Scientific American\n\"\nCommittee were in any way final or conclusive. On the contrary,\nI think that Mr. Bird's replies to Mr. Bradley were quite con-\nclusive, and showed Mr. Bradley to be wrong. {Journal, Amer.\nS.P.R.)\nI cannot agree with Mr. Bradley in thinking that a dark\n\f^^ovEMBEE, 1926 Sittings tuitJi Mr. George Valiantine 155\nseance is not a dark seance merely because the trumpets used are\nilluminated! Nor have I ever heard this argument advanced\nbefore. The illumination would merely show the movements of\nthe trumpets, and not the movements of the medium. Whether\nthe trumpets were moved by some supernormal force, or by the\nmuscles of the medium, would still remain the problem to be\nsolved.\nMay I finally assure Mr. Bradley that I am in no way opposed\nto the possibility of Valiantine's genuine phenomena, and am\nperfectly ready to change my opinion concerning him whenever\n-sufficiently conclusive evidence is forthcoming ? Such evidence\nias not, however, I feel, as yet been furnished.\nHereward Carrington.\nHaving read Mr. Dennis Bradley's statement in the November\nJournal, I find that we are at variance on so many points as\nregards what happened at those Valiantine sittings which I\nattended, and also regarding what I said or did not say at various\ntimes to Mr. Bradley, or in his hearing, that I do not feel justified\nin claiming space in the Journal for a further discussion of the\nmatter. As to whether my memory and observation or those\nof Mr. Bradley, are most reliable, that must remain purely a\nmatter of personal opinion, since we both adhere with equal\ndetermination to totally different accounts of the same occur-\nrences. I imagine that those who know us both will form their\njudgment upon the evidence we have given on former occasions\nof cool and impartial mentality.\nThere is, however, one statement made by Mr. Bradley on\npage 152, which in justice to Mrs. Osborne Leonard and her Con-\ntrol Feda, I must contradict : Mr. Bradley quotes me as having\ninformed him that Feda had told me that she had not made\na mistake\" on the evening of the Valiantine sitting when a\npurporting Feda made a very gxave mistake. What Feda told\nme\\t Mrs. Leonard's and what I repeated to Mr. Bradley, was\nthat she had not spoken at all during the Valiantine sitting in\nquestion.\nI confess I cannot see that this constitutes any cross-con-\nfirmation of evidence of identity \"\u2014if it suggests anything at\nall, it suggests that there was something very wrong with a\n-voice sitting that produced a \"Feda\" voice disclaimed by the\n\f156 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November, 192&\nentity to wliom it was supposed to belong, and a voice wliicli\nas I stated before, bore no resemblance at all to that of Mrs.,\nLeonard's Control. Had Mr. Bradley not been a prey throughout\nthat sitting to the most violent emotions of excitement, distress-\nand indignation, I feel sure that his impressions would have-\nconfirmed my own.\nUna Vincenzo Troubridge.\n\\_Thts correspondence must now cease. Ed.]\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nThe Zeitschnft fur Parapsychologie for July has the continuation,\nof Mr. Krall's experimental study of involuntary whispering. The\nexperiments seem to have been ingeniously conceived and well\nexecuted, and we hope that the articles will be reprinted in\npamphlet form. Dr. Voss contributes a short paper on some\npersonal experiments in clairvoyance, and Dr. Barthel has a note-\nupon the problem of telekinesis.\nThe issue for August has a paper by Professor Messer of Giessen\non his experiences with Frau Silbert of Graz. The sittings have\nno evidential value ; and although Professor Messer prints the\naccounts of the touches \" he receives in italics, it is difficult to\nunderstand what importance he attaches to them since the medium's\nfeet remained uncontrolled beneath the table.\nThe September number of the same periodical has an account\nby Dr. Von Schrenck-Notzing of the new electrical method of\ncontrol derived by Mr. Karl Krall for investigating physical\nmediums, and employed in Munich by Dr. von Schrenck during\nsittings with Willi Schneider. The device consists in a circuit of\nfour lamps, the current for which passes through the medium and\ncontroller by means of metal contacts on hands and feet. If\ncontrol is relaxed the circuit is broken and one or more lights\ngo out, thus revealing where the loss of control has occurred.\nThe Zeitsclmft filr kritischen Okhultismus (Bd. L, Heft 4), has\na long article by Dr. Schulte on methods of control in dark\nsittings, in which he illustrates his points by referring to the\nnumber of sources of error made plain by the ordinary experi-\nmental procedure of normal psychological investigation.\nMr. Dingwall contributes a short note on the importance oi\n\fNovember, 1926 Notes on Periodicals 15T\nthe recent exposure of the photographic medium, George Moss,,\nregarded as an example of the worthlessness of observations by\nuntrained experimenters, whilst Count Klinckowstroem concludes-\nhis survey of cases of telepathy in the earlier literature. Count\nPerovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo publishes a note upon some hitherto,\nalmost unknown experiments with the medium Slade that Aksakoff\nhad in Kussia just after the medium's triumphs with the Zollner\ngroup. Finally, Count Klinckowstroem reviews the recent reports\nof the S.P.K. on the mediums W. Schneider and J. Pronczek.\nThe American Journal of Psychology for July has a characteristic-\npaper by Dr. Walter Prince on the Margery Case. It takes\n[\nthe form of a review of the published literature up to the end of\n: - 192-5. The article is clearly negative, and in substance is a\n;\ndefence of the investigators who have failed to be convinced of\ni\nthe reality of Margery's claims. An attack is also made upon\nf the various publications in favour of the medium, and extracts-\ni\nare selected in order to show the various changes,'\" \" omissions\n\"\nI\nand \"subtractions.'' Dr. Prince lays much stress upon the \" con-\nditions\" which hampered the work of the Scientific American\nCommittee, although he does not explain why the Committee accepted\nthem. Similarly he complains that \"Dr. Crandon was beside-\nMargery in 109* out of the 112 sittings of the Scientific American\nperiod,\" whilst omitting to mention the highly important fact\nthat the link between Dr. Crandon and Margery was often con-\ntrolled by the committee's own observer.^\n1\nJ. M. Bird, Margery (Boston (1925), 154-155, and L. R. G. Crandon in\nJ.A.S.P.R., 1925, xix. 366-367). I have endeavoured to discover the exact statis-\ntics concerning this question, but the condition of the committee-s records-\nrenders accuracy apparently impossible. Dr. Crandon (letter dated July\n30, 1926), writes that \" the link between Margery and myself was controlled\nat every sitting for the Scientihc American Committee, except for red hght\nphenomena where it is not necessary \" : Mr. Bird says (letter of Aug. 4.\n1926), that in forty sittings the link was controlled, and Dr. Prince (letter-\nof July 31, 1926), states that the link was oontroUed in about 36 sittmgs.\nIt appears to be uncertain how many official sittings the Committee held, and.\nthus confusion arose which now it is impossible to reduce to order.\nThe Occult Review for September has an article by Mr. Fortune-\non evidence and proof in occult science. The writer is aware\nthat the present position is unsatisfactory, and admits that the\nnature of proof available concerning the '-Inner Planes\" differs,\nfrom that available for natural science. E.

The light is not caused by the noise or disturbance :\nI am vividly conscious on waking that the vague inchoate begin-\nnings of dreams have been associated with this light which\nvanishes in a flash, with the dreams. In Miss Tubby's words?\n\" the light disappears when the consciousness becomes aware of\nit.\" It seems probable that these lights (the normal-dream and\nthe mediumistic) only differ quantitatively !\n(&) Some months ago you published a letter from me regarding\nthe \" left-handedness \" of my visionary impressions, in connection\n-with my left-handedness.^ I venture to recall this in connection\nwith the letter under discussion. But I am surprised to note\nthat the supernormal light eiiects observed with the right-handed\nmedium, Mrs. Sanders, were massed on the same side as the\nright lobe of the brain : surely right-handedness is due to the domi-\nnation of the left lobe ?\nErnest J.

Romaine Newbold.\nNews which has only now (November 6th) reached us of the\nsudden death on September 26th, at the age of 61, of our\nCorresponding Member, Professor William Romaine Newbold,\nof Philadelphia, is sad news to all who knew him. And\nold members of our Society and those who have read back\nnumbers of Proceedings, especially in connexion with Mrs.\nPiper's mediumship, will realise what a valuable member he\nhas been. He has carried out original investigations and pub-\nlished reports of them in Proceedings, and he has also written\ncriticisms and useful reviews. It is true that of late years he\nhas not done much scientific work in Psychical Research, and\nhe told me in a letter received two years ago, that he did not\nexpect to do any in the future, partly because of the demands\nmade on his time by the students in his classes, and partly\nbecause he had become absorbed in the study of Christian\nand pagan thoughts in the first three centuries of our era.\n\" But,\" he added, \"I am none the less interested, and I try\nto keep in touch with the work and to gain members for the\n\f162 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Decembek, 1926\nSociety wtenever opportunity ofiers.\" Certainly he was one\nof the kindest of Corresponding Members, ready to take\ntrouble, and help in any way he could.\nProfessor Newbold tells us in Proceedings, Vol. XIV. p. 11,\nthat he first became interested in Psychical Research in the\nwinter of 1890-1891, as a result of reading the report of\nsittings held with Mrs. Piper during her first visit to England,\npublished in Vol. VI. of Proceedings. This led to his arrang-\ning for sittings with Mrs. Piper, of which he had a large num-\nber between 1891 and 1895, reported on in a paper published by\nhim in Proceedings, Vol. XIV., as a first instalment of Hodg-\nson's projected sequel to his report in Vol. XIII. Professor\nNewbold did not know Dr. Hodgson when his own investiga-\ntions into the subject began, but they afterwards became\nintimate friends ; and sittings he had with Mrs. Piper after\nDr. Hodgson's death in 1905, with a view to getting, if possible,\ninto communication with him, form an interesting part of\nProfessor William James's \" Report on Mrs. Piper's Hodgson-\nControl \" published in Proceedings, Vol. XXIII.\nI met Professor Newbold for the first and, I think, only\ntime at the International Congress of Experimental Psychology\nheld in Loudon in 1892. I do not know whether it was his\ngeneral interest in Psj^chology or his special interest in Psychi-\ncal Research that led him to attend the Congress, but Psychi-\ncal Research was rather prominent at that Congress, and a\ndesire to meet those responsible for the report on Mrs. Piper,\nwhich had interested him, may well have been an important\nattraction. It was in the autumn of that year that he first\njoined the S.P.R.\u2014as an Associate of the American Branch-\n-\nand not till more than ten years later (1903) that he became\na Corresponding Member.\nThough my acquaintance with Professor Newbold was in\nfact slight, for our letters were infrequent, I knew him well\nenough to realise that he was an unusually sympathetic man,\nand am not surprised to learn that he was extremely popular\nwith his pupils. He had been a lecturer at the University\nof Pennsylvania since 1889 and a Professor there since 1903.\nEleanor Mildred Sidgwick.\n\fDecember, 1926 Case 163\nL. 1275. CASE.\nA Book-Test.\nWe print below a report on a book-test obtained at a sitting\nwith Mrs. Leonard, taken by Mrs. Hugh Meredith. '\nThe\nreport of the case came to us through Mrs. Sydney Leaning, a\nMember of this Society, to whom Mrs. Meredith is personally\nknown, and who, when sending the report of the case, wrote\nto Mrs. Salter, the Editor, as follows :\nElmstead,\nEpsom Lane, Tadworth,\nAugust 8th, 1926.\nI have to-day, while reading the Leonard Sittings Eeport in\nour latest Proceedings, received from the writer, Mrs. Meredith,\nthe enclosed report. I had heard of her sitting and its results\nand thought it very good, and asked if she would write me an\naccount which I could forward to our Journal. She brought it\nover herself, from Walton-on-the-Hill, and I have seen (a) her\noriginal notes, taken at the sitting, (b) her friend Miss Parry's\ncorroborating letter. She assures me that she has no objection\nat all to her actual name being used, nor has Miss Parry, whom\nshe asked on Friday about it. . . .\nF. E. Leaning.\nIt will be seen that this book-test differs from most of\nthose obtained through Mrs. Leonard in that it contains a\ndefinitely experimental element, the experiment being designed\nto test whether any supernormal knowledge was shown not so\nmuch of the book in itself as of the thoughts of a person\nwho had lately read it.. We print first an explanatory\nstatement from Mrs. Meredith concerning various relevant\nfacts, and especially concerning the circumstances which led\nup to the experiment.\nStatement by Mrs. Meredith.\nOn March 2.5th, 1926, I had a letter from Mrs. Leonard saying\nthat a friend who was to have a sitting with her on Friday, 26th,\nwas unable to keep the appointment, but had written to her\n\f164 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Deoembkk, 1926\nsuggesting that I might like to come instead. I wrote at once,\ngratefully accepting the offer.\nThat evening, March 25th, I met in town Miss A. L. Parry,\na friend who had lived with me for nearly four years in Australia,\nand as we sat at dinner I told her of my good fortune in getting\nanother sitting with Mrs. Leonard, and said that I should like\nif possible to get some simple test through.\nWe are rather ignorant of such matters, but decided that when\nshe went home she should read some special book in bed last\nthing at night and that I should ask the name of it at the\nsitting. She was to decide on the book after she left me so\nthat I might be quite in the dark about it.\nThen after she knew my sitting with Mrs. Leonard was over,\nshe was to write and tell me what book she had read.\nShe was living at Southfields and I was at Walton-on-the-Hill.\nOn Friday, 26th, I had my sitting and took very copious notes\nwhich rather troubled my communicators, but Feda kept holding\nthem back very kindly so that I might get my record.\nOn Saturday, 27th, I read the full account aloud to a cousin\nwho had come up to spend the day with me. Neither of us\ncould make any sense out of the notes relating to the book-test,\nexcept that with regard to what Feda had said about \" light\n\"\nI half expected the book chosen to be '\nThe Light that Failed,'\nas I knew my friend Miss Parry had just bought a complete set\nof Kipling.\nFor the sake of clearness, before giving particulars of the sitting,\nI must mention a few facts about those concerned.\nMy husband, Hugh Meredith, and I were married and went to\nBurma in 1916. In February, 1918, he had to retire owing to\nill-health. We went to Australia to seek a better climate for his\nlung trouble. I got a post at Frensham, Mittagong, a school in\nthe Southern Heights of New South Wales, and after six months\nin a Sanatorium in the Blue Mountains, he came and joined me in\nthe Southern Heights and I went on with my teaching. We were\nthen very happy and very hopeful in our cottage in '\nThe Holt.'\nHowever, in April, 1919, we were ordered out West for the\nwinter, and when the hot weather came we decided to have a\nhome of our own in the Blue Mountains.\nTo this house my friend Miss Parry came for the first time,\nand for her first visit to Australia in the November of 1920.\n\fDecembee, 1926 Case 165\nAnd here my husband died on April 7th, 1924, while Miss\nParry was still with us. When he died, a friend who had lost\nher husband in similar circumstances wrote me these few lines\nfrom '\nThe Disciples '\nby Eleanor Hamilton King\n:\nAnd often mused\nOn the strange fate that had elected me\nTo live so close to heroes, and to share\nSuch noble things, and in their hour of need\nTo be obedient to them\u2014and to serve\nHim whom I loved the best of all the world.\n'\nThe Disciples '\nhad no significance for us before my husband\ndied, though I had a copy in my possession.\nExtracts from Mrs. Meredith's original notes of her sitting with\nMrs. Leonard, March mh, 1926.\nFeda. Did she (A.L.P.) think of ttvo books ? I feel as if she\nwas thinking of another book too. (Note 1.)\nCan't always read the books. They don't often read\nwords, they get the sense. But the book she read\nSuggests travelling, and a lot of places, covering a lot\nof ground, not a book of a few places, but a book\ntouching (especially in the beginning) on many places.\n(Note 2.)\nSomething about Light at the beginning. Light\ncomes in rather 'portantly in this book. (Note 3.)\nHe smiles and says, \" If you [A.H.M.] open that\nbook, you know the flies pages [Feda's way of saying\n\" fly-leaves \"] ? There's something on one of those\npages which signifies the survival, the continuity of\nLife,\" and also, he can't see the words, but gets the\nidea of Light. (Note 4.)\nCould you look early in the book and see if it\ndescribes a place that you and he have been in\ntogether, here on earth ? He says he wants to ex-\nplain he's not sure it's really the place you were at,\nbut it would fit the place you were at. He says,\n\" A place we were happy at, one of the most hopeful\nplaces, and where we had perhaps a happier condition\nthan ever after or before.\" He's very interested and\nhopes you'll be able to place it.\n\f166 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December, 1926\nNotes hy Mrs. Meredith.\n1.

Meredith.\nAugust 1th, 1926.\n\f168 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December, 1926\nREVIEW.\nThe History of Witchcraft and Demonology. By Montague\nSummers. London. Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co.,\nLtd. 1926. {The History of Civilization. Edited by C. K.\nOgden.)\nIt is difficult to understand how this volume came to be included\nin Messrs. Kegan Paul's admirable series, The History of Civiliza-\ntion. The volumes hitherto published have been in the main\nserious contributions to their respective subjects, and the writers\non Pre-History have not been chosen from those whose text-book\nis the Book of Genesis, neither has Mr. Bryan, we hope, been\ninvited to offer an account of Evolution. We cannot think that\na volume comparable with Buckland's Reliquiae Diluvianae of\n1823 would appear in Mr. Ogden's list, and this fact alone suffices\nto distinguish sharply the position of psychical research as com-\npared with other sciences. For elsewhere the Noachian geology\nand zoology are now relegated to the backwoods of thought, and\napparently it is only in the abstruse region of psycho-pathology\nthat demonologists and heresy hunters like Mr. Summers can make\nthemselves heard.\nThe present volume is not a history of witchcraft or of demono-\nlogy. It is a confused and illogical mass of descriptive matter\nappertaining to both, highly spiced with crapulent material, and\naccompanied by a running comment of disjointed extracts culled\nfrom an immense mass of material relating to the Witch cult.\nMr. Summers thinks that witchcraft is connected with the\nprimitive Gnostic communities, which were guilty of every kind\nof abomination, of which the details are set forth by their enemies\nin the most lurid terms. Indeed witchcraft, as it existed in\nEurope from the eleventh century, was \" mainly the spawn of\nGnostic heresy \"\n(p. 29), for its real \" foul essence \" was the\nworship of Satan. Satan, to Mr. Summers, is a very real person,\nbut his efforts to make our flesh creep cannot be said to have\nsucceeded. He discusses the \" sin of the rebel angels,\" and we\nlearn that Lucifer had a high rank in the celestial hierarchy, but\nhe still wished to be God. Since God has produced miracles, the\nDevil, God's ape, must therefore produce them also (excluding,\nof course, those with the saints), and so the tricks of the Indian\njuggler are explained, as well as the phenomena of the Sabbat.\n\fDecember, 1926 Review 169\nThe phenomena of witchcraft are true because the learned doctors\nof the Church affirm it, and even the \" incubi \" and \" succubi\n\"\nare realities. In this latter case, \" all the great saints and scholars\nand all moral theologians of importance \" agree, and the demono-\nlogists also range themselves \" in a solid phalanx of assent\n\"\n(p. 93.)\nIt has only remained for Mr. Summers to prove scientifically\nthat this august body of witnesses is correct. The demons,\nwhen they wish to fulfil their evil desires, are materialised from\nectoplasm, for are we not informed of incidents which \" go far\nto prove the partial re-materialisation of the dead by the vibra-\ntions of the natural substance and ectoplasmic emanations of the\nliving \" (p. 96) 1 Witchcraft and Satanism are then to Mr.\nSummers horrid realities, which have existed in the past and con-\ntinue to exist. In \" those lone empty houses innocently pla-\ncarded '\nTo be Sold ' \"\n(p. 135), hideous rituals may be proceeding,\nand the vile orgies of the Sabbat are often concentrated in quiet\nCathedral cities in a vain endeavour to disturb those peaceful\ncentres with \" the foul brabble of devil worship \"\n(p. 151).\nIt is only by reading Mr. Summers' amazing analysis that one\ncan realise the ghastly fate of those unfortunate wretches who\nincurred the suspicion of the Catholic authorities. What chance\nhad the early students of obscure phenomena or the participators\nin a fertility cult before- men to whom demons were as common as\ndogs, and who were profoundly ignorant of the most elementary\nprinciples of medical psychology ? It is not difficult to under-\nstand how men believed in these things in the days when the\nscientific method was scarcely conceived. That they should\nbelieve in them to-day is a melancholy commentary upon intel-\nlectual progress. Perhaps encouragement may be sought in the\nfact that those whose minds can still assimilate these monstrous\nsuperstitions have no longer the power to exercise their talents\nin burning their fellow creatures at the stake.\nE. J. Dingwall.\n\f170 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December, 1926\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nThe issue for July-September of the Journal of Abnormal and\nSocial Psychology has a brief account by Dr. H. H. Goddard of\na case of dual personality which has recently come under his\nobservation. The contrast between the alternating personalities\nwas strongly marked, and the case (that of a young woman of\nnineteen years of age) presents several important and suggestive\nfeatures, of which the insistent idea of incestus patris is one of\nthe most interesting.\nThe American Journal of Psychology for October has a paper\non '\nMescal Visions and Eidetic Vision '\nby Mr. Kliiver of Minnesota.\nAn account of the visions is given and the results of experiments\nrecorded in reference to those previously undertaken in connexion\nwith eidetic vision.\nThe Journal of the American S.P.R. for September has a paper\nby Dr. Haines on Vaticination, in which he gives an account of\ncertain cases recorded in the past and also a further collection of\nstories of the alleged poltergeist phenomena occurring in the\npresence of the Roumanian peasant, Eleonore Zugun.\nThe Revue Metapsychique for May-June, 1926, has a continua-\ntion of the description by Dr. Osty of the phenomena obtained\nthrough the mediumship of M. Pascal Forthuny, and also a note\nby Professor Richet on Dr. Moll's criticism of the Institute's\nexperiments with the medium Kahn. (See Journal, S.P.R. , June\n1926, pp. 93-95.)\nThe substance of Professor Richet's reply is to the effect that\nsince Dr. Moll was not present at the sittings his criticism can\nhave little weight. \" M. Moll n'a rien vu,\" writes Professor\nRichet :\n\" il juge les choses de loin et de haut, a distance.\" Kahn\nhas not, in many instances, touched the papers, and therefore\nM. Moll's suspicion that substitution has been practised is not\njustified. Indeed M. Moll \" ne nous a rien devoile : il ne pouvait\nle faire puisqu'il n'etait pas la.\"\nThe Zeitschrift fur Parapsychologie for October has an account\nby Mr. Krall of the alleged powers of telepathy exhibited by\nGeorges Ninoff, and in the same number Professor Driesch con-\ntributes a paper on Psychical Research and Academic Science, of\nwhich the English version formed his Presidential Address to the\nSociety. -p x\n\fNOTICES.\nMEETING OF THE COUNCIL.\nA Meeting of the Council will be held at 31 Tavistock Square, London,\nW.C. 1, on Monday, December 20, 1926, at 3 p.m.\nPEIVATE MEETING\nA Private Meeting of the Society -will be held in the Society's Rooms,\n31 Tavistock Square, London, W.C. 1, on Monday, December 20th, 1926, at\n5 p.m., when a paper entitled \"A Report on the Alleged Action of Nervous\nEffluence in Hypnotism \" (cf. \" Problems of Hypnotism,\" by Dr. Sydney\nAlrutz, Proc.
