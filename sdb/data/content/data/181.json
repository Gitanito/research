His father, John Hope, the 1st Marquis of Linlithgow, was a colonial governor. &nbsp;Hope was educated at Eton College and served in the army from 1911.  Psychical Research\n\nHope joined the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) in 1926 and served on its governing council between 1931 and 1955. He was a generous supporter of the organization, in terms both of time and financial donations. In 1931 he was invited by the London Spiritual Alliance to become a member of its research branch, the London Psychical Laboratory.\n\nSittings with the American medium George Valiantine1 in 1927 left him disappointed at the lack of evidence of postmortem survival, and uncertain even whether Valiantine was genuine.2 Other activities included a a visit to Brook House, Frimley, the site of an alleged haunting, in 1949,3 and the acquisition of molds of the \u2018Walter\u2019 thumbprints from the Margery s\u00e9ances in the late 1920s.4  Rudi Schneider\n\nHope collaborated with Eugene Osty\u2019s investigation of the Austrian medium Rudi Schneider in Paris between 1930 and 1931. The following year he conducted his own experiments with Schneider in London, publishing his findings in the SPR Proceedings5 along with similar reports by other investigators. Here he drew attention to apparatus used and precautions against fraud; he also had audio recordings made of Schneider\u2019s peculiar breathing while in a trance.6 He contested claims by Harry Price that Schneider fraudulently used a free hand to stage phenomena, arguing that this only damaged Price\u2019s reputation.7 &nbsp;He later published his recollections of his involvement with Schneider,8 maintaining that under sympathetic conditions Schneider was able to produce \u2018impressive phenomena\u2019 and adding that Schneider\u2019s belief in his \u2018unusual\u2019 powers was \u2018quite genuine\u2019.  Borley Rectory\n\nHope made two visits to Borley Rectory, the location of an alleged haunting, in 1929. His extensive notes (housed in Cambridge University Library) were quoted frequently in a critical survey published later by Dingwall, Goldney and Hall.9 &nbsp;In comments made to Harry Price, who led the investigation, Hope said \u2018I was not impressed and thought the phenomena were produced by normal means\u2019.10  Selected Articles\n\nAppendix \u2013 Report on some sittings with Valiantine and Phoenix in 1927 (1932).
