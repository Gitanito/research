THE ILLUMINATI.\nI93\nwas judging fairly ofthe feelings of a female mind:\nBut theyjudged falfely, and only according to their\nown coarfe experience, when they attributed their dif-\nguft and their fears to coynefs. Coyncfs is indeed the\ninitin\u00e9tive attribute of the female. In woman it is very\ngreat, and it is perhaps the genuine fource of the djgu\/1?\nof which the Illuminati were fufpicious. But they have\nbeen dim-lighted indeed, or\nvery unfortunate in their\nacquaintance, if they never ohferved any other fource\nofrepugnance in the mind of Woman to what is im-\nmoralior immodeit--ifthey did not fee diflike--moral\ndifapprobation. Do they mean to iniinuate, that in\nthat regard which modeft women\nexprefs in all their\nwords and actions, for what every one underftands by\nthe terms decency, modefty, and the difapprobation\nof every. thing that violates thofe feelings, the women\nonly fhow female coynefs? Then are they very blind\n\u00fe\u00ffinf'tru \u00ac'tors. But they are not fo blind. The account\ngiven of the initiation of a\nyoung Sifter at Frankfort,\nunder the feigned name\nPjjfcbrzrion, lhows the moft\nferupulous attention to the moral feelings of the fex,\nand the confuhon and difturbance which, after all their\ncare, it occahoned among the ladies, Ihows, that when\nthey thought all right and delicate, they had been but\ncoarfejudges. Minos damns the ladies there, becaufe\nthey are too free, too rich, too\nrepublican, and too\nwife, for being led about by the nofe (this is his own\nexpreIlion).' But Philo certainly thought more cor-\nrectly ofthe fex in general, when he fays, Truth is a\nmodeft girl: She may be handed about like a\nlady, by\ngood fenfe and good manners, but ITILIPC not be bullied\nand driven about like a\nPtrumpet. I would here infert\nthe difcourfes or addrefies which were made on that\noccalion to the different claifes of the aifembly, girls,\nyoung ladies, Wives, young men, and ftrangers, which\n*QB are\n4\n\f194 ILLUMINATJ. e'HA1\u00b0. lf.\nare really ingenious and well ccmpofed, were\nthey not\nfueh as would ollend my fair countrywomen.\n~\nThe religious fentinients by which mortals are to be\nalhfted, even in the difcharge of their moral duties,\nand flill more, the fentiments vohich are\npurely reli-\ngious, and have no reference to any thing here, are\nprecifely thole which are mofl: ealily excited in the\nmind of woman. Affection, adniiration, lilial reve-\nrence, are, if I niiilalte not\nexceedingly, thofe in\nwhich the women hir furpafs the men; and it is on\nthis account that we\ngenerally find them fo much dif-\npofed to devotion, which is nothing but a fort of fond\nindulgence ofthofe alife\u00e9tions without limit to the ima-\ngination. The enraptured devotee pours out her foul\nin expreilions of theie feelings, juft as a fond mother\nmixes the eareiles given to her child with the moil ex-\ntravagant expreflions of love. The devotee even en-\ndeavours to excite higher degrees of thefe 'aFE`e\u00e9`tions,\nby expatiating on fuch circumllances in the divine\nconduct with refpect to man as\nnaturally awaken them;\nand he does this without any fear of exceeding; be-\ncauie infinite Vvildom and Goodnefs will alwaysjuftify\nthe ientiment, and free the expreiiion of it from all\ncharge of hyperbole or extravagance.\nI am convinced, therefore, that the female mind is\nwell adapted to cultivation by means of religion, and\nthat their native ioltnefs and kindnefs of heart will al-\nways be hifhcient hor procuring it a favourable recep-\ntion from them. It is therefore with double regret\nthat I fee any of them _ioin in the arrogant pretenhons\nof our lllutninated philofophers, who lee no need of\niuch aliillances for the knowledge and difcharge of\ntheir duties. There is nothing fo unlike that general\nmodeliy of thought, and that dillidence, which we are\ndifpofed to thinl; the chara_c`ter of the female mind. I\n\u00a31111\n\fCHAP_ 11, THE ILLUMINATI.\n195\nam inclined to think, that fuch deviations from the ge-\nneral contlu\u00e9t of the fex are marks of a harhier chri-\nra\u00e9ter, ofa heart that has lefs iienhbility, :tml is on the\nwhole lefs amiable than that of others. Yet it mutt\nbe owned' that there are fome fuch among us. Much,\nifnot the whole of this perverfion, has, I ani perfaiacl-\ned, been owing to the contagion of bad example in\nthe men.

There is fome-\nthing of this to be obferved in all nations. Cf all the\ndiltinctions which fet our\nfpecies above the other fen--\ntient inhabitants of this globe, making us as unlike to\nthe belt of them as\nthey are to a\npiece of inanimate\nmatter, there is none more remarkable than the differ-\nences obfervable in the appearances of thofe defires by\nwhich the race is continued.

There\nmuliz be a mom! connection, in order that the human\nfpecies may be a race of rational creatures, improve-\nable, not only by the increaiing experience of the in-\ndividual, but alfo by the heritable experience of the\nfucceihve generations.

THE ILLUMINATI.\n197\nwe fee that the conlideration in which the fex is held,\nnearly follows the proportions of that aggregate of ma-\nny different particulars, which We eonhder as conlti-\ntuting the cultivation of a\nfociety. We may perhai 5\nerr, and we\nprobably do err, in our eflzimation of thofe\ndegrees, becaufe we are not\nperfe\u00e9`tly acquainted with\nwhat is the real excellence of man. But as far as we\ncrm\njudge of it, I believe that my aflertion is acknow-\nledged. On this authority, I might prefume to ity,\nthat it is in Chriflian Europe that man bas attained his\nhigheft degree of cultivation-and it is undoubtedly\nhere that the women have attained the higheilt rank.\nI may even add, that it is in that part ofliurope where\nthe effential and cliftinguilhing doctrines of Chriilian\nmorality are mofl: generally acknowledged and attended\nto by the laws of the country, that woman acts the\nhigheft part in general fociety. But here We mufr be\nvery careful how we form our notion, either of the\nfociety, or of the female rank-it is furely not from\nthe two or three dozens who 511 the higheit ranks in\nthe ftate. Their number is too fmall, and their litu-\nation is too\nparticular, to afford the proper average.\nBeiicles, the lituation ofthe individuals ofthis clafs in\nall countries is very much the fame-and in all it is\nvery artihcial-accordingly their character is fantalti-\ncal.

The lituation of women of this\nclafs rnuil be nearly the fame in allinations. But this\nclafs is (till ftifceptible of Home variety-and we lee it\n--and I think that even here there is a\nperceptible fu-\nperiority of the female rank in thole countries where\n\"\nthe\n\f3-93 THE ILLUMINATI. ~crtaP. 11.\nt_he pureft Chrillianity prevails. Vvre mufl however\ntake our meafures or\nproportions from a numerous\nclal`s, but alfo a clafs in lbmewhat of eafy circum-\nilganees, where moral fentiments call fome attention,\nand perfons have fome choice in their conduot. And\nhere, although I cannot\npretend to have had many\nopportunities of obfervation, yet I have had fome. I\ncan venture to\nfay that it is not in Ruliia, nor in\nSpain, that Woman is, on the whole, the rnoft im-\nportant as a member of the community. I would\nfay, that in Britain her important rights are more\nge-\nnerally refpeeted than any Where elle. No Where is,\na man's charafter fo much hurt by conjugal infide-\nlity--no where is it fo difhcult to rub o\u00a7 the Ftigrna\nof baltardy, or to\nprocure a decent reception or loci-\nciety for an\nimproper conneftion, and I believe it\nwill readily begranted, that the more of the women\nin fucceilions, their authority in all matters of domef-\ntic truft, and even their opinions in what concerns\nlife and manners, are fully more\nrel\"pe\u00a3`:ed here than\nin\nany country,\nI have long been of the opinion, (and every oblier-\nvation that I have been able to make Ence I firft\nformed it confirms me in it,) that woman is indebted\nto Chriftianity alone for the high rank fue holds in\nlbciety.

He commu-\nnicated the ranks and the _\ninilructions by a letter,\nwithout any ceremony. The correhiondence with\nPhilo at the time ofthe breach with him, ihews the\nfuperiority of Spartacus. Philo is in a\nrage, provok-\ned to find a\npitiful profeflor difcontented with the\nimmenfefervices which he had received from a\ngen-\ntleman of his rank, and treating him with authority,\nand with dihngenuity.-He tells Spartacus what Hill\ngreater fervices he can do the Order, and that he can\nalfo ruin it with a breath.-But in the midli of this\nrage, he propofes a thoufand modes of reconcile-\nment. The fmallefi concellion would make him\nhug Spartacus in his arms. But Spartacus is deaf to\nall his threats, and firm as a rock. Though he is con-\nfcious of his own vile conducfl, he abates not in the\niinalleii point, his abfolute authority-requires the\nmoftfimplicit fubmiiiion, which he lays\n\"\nis due not\nto him, but to the Order, and without which the\nOrder inull immediately go to ruin.\"--He does not\neven\ndeign to challenge Philo to do his worfl, but\nallows him to go out of the Order without one\nangry\nWord. This lhows his conlidence in the energy of\nthat fpirit of relllefs difcontent, and that hankering\nafter reform which he had fo fuccefsfully fpread a-\nbroad.\n`\n\u00bb\nThis had indeed arifen to an\nunparalleled height,\nunexpe\u00e9led even by the feditious' themfelves.

There are fome blunders in refpeft\nof names, which an inhabitant ofthe country could\nhardly_ be guilty of, but are\nvery coniillent with the\nfelf-conceit and precipitancy of this Frenchman,-\nThere are feveral inllances of the fame kind in two\npieces, which are known for certain to be his, viz.\nthe C\/Jrozzzqzrejrzfzdalezje and the HMOz're _kcreiie de\nla Com' de Berlin. Thefe letters were in every hand,\nand were mentioned in every converfation, even in\nthe Prufhan dominions-and in other places ofthe\nempire they were quoted, and praifed, and com-\nmented on, although fume of their-contents were\nnothing ihort of rebellion.\nMirabeau had a\nlarge portion of that felf-conceit\nwhich dillinguilhes his countrymen. He thought\nhimfelf qualified not only for any high oliice in ad-\nminillration, but even for managing the whole afa-\nfairs of the new\nKing. He therefore endeavoured\nto obtain fome poll of honour. But he was\ndifap-\npointed, and, in revenge, did every thing in his\npower to make thofe in adrniniilration the obje\u00e9ls of\npublic ridicule and reproach. His licentious and\nprofligate manners were fuch as excluded him from\nthe fociety of the people of the Full clafles, whom\nit behoved to\npay fome attention to perfonal digni-\nty. His opinions were in the highefl degree cor-\nrupted, and he openly profefled Atheifm. This\nmade him peculiarly obnoxious to the King, who was\ndetermined to correcl the dilturbances and difquiets\nwhich had arifen in the Prutlian Hates from the in~\ndifference of his predeceflbr in thofe matters. Mi-\nrabeau therefore attached himfelf to a\njunto of wri-\nters and fcribblers, who had united in order to dif-\nfeminate licentious principles, both in refpeft of re-\nligion and of government. His wit and fancy were\ngreat, and he had not\nperhaps his equal for eloquent\nand\n\f#Zoo 'ms GERMAN UNION, can, iii,\nand biting fatire. He was therefore carefied by\nthofe writers as a moll valuable acquifition to their\nSociety. He took all this deference as his juil due;\nand was fo confident in his powers, and fo foolifh,\nas to advife, and even to admonifh, the King.\nHighly obnoxious by fuch condu\u00e9l, he was excluded\nfrom any Chance of preferment, and was exceeding-\nly out of humour. In this flate of mind he was in\na fit frame for Illumination. Spartacus had been\neyeing him for fome time, and at lall Communicated\nthis honour to him through the intermedinm oth\/Iat1\u00bb\nvillon, another Frenchman, Lieutenant-Colonel in\nthe fervice of the Duke of Brunfwick. This perfon'\nhad been moil atflive during the formal exillence of\nthe Order, and had contributed much to its recep-\ntion in the Proteflant Ptates-he remained long con-\ncealed. Indeed his Illumination was not known till\nthe invalion of Holland by the French. Mauvillon\nthen Ptepped forth, avowed his principles, and rel\ncommended the example of the French to the Ger-\nmans. This encouragement brought even Philo\nagain on the flage, notwithilanding his refentment\nagainil Spartacus, and his folemn declaration of hav-\ning abjured all fuch focieties.-Thefe, and a thou-\nfand fuch facts, fhow that the feeds of licentious\nCofmopolitifm had taken deep root, and that Cut-\nting down the crop had by no means defiroyed the\nbaneful plant.--But this is not all-a new method of\ncultivation had been invented, and immediately\nadopted, and it was now growing over all Europe in\nanother form.\n`\n\u00bb\u00bb\nI have already taken notice of the general perver-\nIion of the public mind which co-operated with the\nfchifms of Free Mafonry in procuring a\nliiiening\near to Spartacus and his afiociates. It will not be\ndoubted but that the machinations of the Illuminati\nincreafed this, even among thofe who did not enter\n. into\n\fcms. iii; 'ma GERMAN umorr. Q01\ninto the Order. It was eaiier to diminlh the refpeffl\nfor civil eflablilhments in Germany than in almoit\nany other country. The frivolity of the ranks and\ncourt-offices in the dilierent confederated petty Hates\nmade it impoihble to combine dignity with the ha-\nbits of a\nfcanty incorne.--lt was ftill eaher to\nexpofe\nto ridicule and reproach thofe nurnberlefs abufes\nwhich the folly and the vices of rneu had introdu-\nced into religion. The irifiuence on the public mind\nwhich naturally attaches to the venerable oflice of a\nmoral \u00fe\u00ffinllru\"(,\nwas\nprodigiou{ly dirniniihed by the\ncontinual difputes of the Catholics and Proteftants,\nwhich were carried on with great heat in every little\nprincipality. The freedom of enquiry, which was\nihpported by the fiate in Protefiant Germany, was\nterribly abufed, (for what will the folly of man not\nabufe?) and degenerated into a wanton licentiouf-\nnefs of thought, and a rage for fpeculation and fcep-\nticifm on\nevery fubje\u00e9t whatever. The Ptruggle,\nwhich was\noriginally between the Catholics and the\nProteltants, had changed, during the gradual progrefs\nof luxury and immorality, into a Contelt between\nreafon and fuperllition. And in this conteft the\ndenomination of fuperftitiou had been gradually ex-\ntended to every do\u00e9irine which profefied to be of\ndivine revelation, and reafon was declared to be, for\ncertain, the only way in which the Deity can inform\nthe human mind,\n'\nSome refpe&able Catholics had publiihed works\nfilled with liberal fentiments. Thefe were\nrepre-\nfented as villainous machinations to inveigle Protei-\ntants. On the other hand, fome Proteitant divines\nhad propofed to imitate this liberality by making con-\nQeliions which might enable a\ngood Catholic to live\nmore at eafe among the Proteftants, and might even\naccelerate an union of faiths. This was hooted be-\nyond meafure, as jefuitical, and big with danger.\n'While\n\fQ02 rua GERMAN UNION. naar. iii.\nWhile the fceptical junio, headed by the editors of\n,rhe Dmiwbe Bib\/inthe\/c and the Berlin Mofzazjbrfi,\nwere recommending every performance thatwashof-\ntileto the eftablifhecl faith ofthe country, Leuehtfen~\nring was\nequally bufy, finding jefuits in every corner,\nand we-nt about with all the inquietude of a madman,\npicking up anecdotes. Zimmerman, the refpe<fia'n'le\nphylician of Frederick King of Prnfiia, gives a di-\nverting account of a viht which he had from Leucht-\nfenringat Hanover, all trembling with fears of je-\nfuits, and wiihing to perfuade him that his life was\nin danger from them. Nicholai was now on the\nhunt, and during this crufade Philo laid hands on\nhim, being introduced to his acquaintance by Leucht-\nfenring, who was, by this time, cured of his zeal for\nProtelianifm, and had become adifciple of Illumi-\nnatifm. Philo had gained his good opinion by the vi-\nolentattack which he had publilhed on the Jefnits and\nRofycrucians by the orders of Spartacus.-He had\nnot far to go in gaining over Nicholai, who was at\nthis time making a tour through the Lodges. The\nfparks of Illumination which he perceived in many\nof them, pleaied him exceedingly, and he very cheer-\nfully received the precious fecret from Philo.\nThis acquihtion to the Order was made in janua-\nry 1782. Spartacus was\ndelightedwith it, conHder~\ned Nicholai as a moli excellent champion, and gave\nhim the name of Luczkzzz, the great feoffer at all reli-\ngion,~as aptly exprelhng his charafier.\nNicholai, on his return to Berlin, publilhed many\nvolumes of his difcoveries. One would imagine\nzhat not a\nIefuit had efcaped him. He mentions\nmany firange fchiiinatics, both in religion and in\nMafonry--But he never once mentions an Illzmzzizzz-\nlus.-VVhen they were iirfi checked, and before the\ndifcovery ofthe fecret correfpondence, he defended\nthem, and iirongly reprobated the proceedings of the\nEleeior\nf\n\fCHAP. iii.

On the authority\nof a\nlady in Conrland, a Countefs von der Recke,\nNicholai had accufed Dr. Stark of Darnifladt (who\nmade fuch a\nfigure in Free Mafonry) of jefuitifm,\nand of having even fubrnitted to the Zo1Mz;\"e.

Philo, fpeakingin one of his letters ofthe gradual change\nwhich was to be produced in the minds of their pupils from Chrifti#\nanity to Deifm, fays,\n\"\nNicholai informs me, that even the pious\n\"\n'Zollikofer has now been convinced that it would be proper to let\n\"\nup a deiftical church in Berlin.\" It is in vain that Niehelai\nfays that his knowledge of the Order was\nonly of what Weidiaupt\nhad publilhed; for Philo fays that that correelted fyllem had not\nbeen introduced into it when he quitted it in 1784. But Nicholai\ndeferves no credit-he is one of the molt fcandalous examples of\nthe operation of the principles of Vlleiihaupt. He procured ad-\nmillion into the Lodges of Free Mafons and Rofycrucians, merely\nto aft the difhonourable part of a\nfpy, and he betrayed their fecrets\nas far as he could. In the appendix to the 7th volume of his\njourney, he declaims againlt the Templar Mafons, Rofycrucians,\nand jcfuits, for their blind fubmillion to unknown fuperiors, for\ntheir fuperllitions, their priefthoods, and their bale principles-and\nyet had been five years in a\nfociety in which all thefe were carried\nto the greatelt height.

The \u00fe\u00ffI'T7\"dg`77l\u00ac7lf.\u00a7`and Horus are books which\naim directly, and without any concealment, to de-\nllroy the authority of our\nScriptures, either as hillo-\nrical narrations or as revelations of the intentions of\nprovidence and ofthe future profpecis of man. The\nTheological writings of Babrdf are grofs perverhons,\nboth of the fenle of the text, and of the moral in-\nPtructions contained in it, and are\nperhaps the melt\nexceptionable pertormances on the fu_bjec'l.

The Apoflles, Peter, james,\nJohn, and Andrew, were the E!e\u00e9'?, and Brethren of\nthe'Third Degree, and initiated into all the myfie-\nries. The remaining Apoftles were\nonly of the\nSecond Degree ; and the Seventy-two were of the\nFirft degree.

The great miftery is, that J--C---wasa\nNaiuralf, and taught the doctrine ofa Supreme\nMind, the Spectator, but not the Governer of the\nWorld, pretty nearly in the fenfe of the Stoics.\nThe Initiated Brethren were to be iniiruafled by read-\ning proper books.

The ex-\ntenlive literary mannfafture of Germany is carri-\ned on in Rich a manner that it is impofhble for any\nthing leis than the joint operation of the whole\nfederated powers to prevent this. The fpirit of\nfreethinking and innovating in religions matters\nhad been remarkably prevalent in the dominions\nof the King of Prullia, having been much encou-\nraged by the indilierence of the late King. One of\nthe vileflthingspublilhed on this occahon was an a-\nbominable farce, called the Religion Edi\u00e9ft. This\nwas traced to Bahrdt's Ruhe, and the Doctor was ar-\nrefled, and all his papers feized and ranfacked. The\ncivil Magillrate was glad of an\nopportunity of expif-\nCating the German Union, which common fame had\nalfo traced hither. The correfpondence was ac-\ncordingly exarnined, and many difcoveries were\nmade, which there was no occahon to communicate\nto the public, and the profecution of the buiinefs of\nthe Union was\nby this means\nllopped. But the per-\nfons in high ollice at Berlin agree in faying that the\nAflociation of writers and other turbulent perfons in\nGermany has been but very faintly hit by this blow,\nand is almoll as a\u00e9live as ever.\nThe German Union appears a mean and precipi-\ntate Alfociation.

The many contefts\nbetween the King and the Parliament of Paris about\nthe regiltration of his edicfts, had given occaiion to\nmuch difculiion, and had made the public familiar-\nly acquainted with topics altogether unfuitable to\nthe abfolute monarchy of France.\nThis acquaintance with th.e natural expefiations\nof the nibjeft, and the expediency of a candid at-\ntention on the part of Government to thefe expec-\ntations, and a view of Legillationland Government\nfounded on a\nvery liberal interpretation of all thefe\nthings, was prodigioufly promoted by the rafh inter-\nference of France in the difpute between Great\nBritain and her colonies. In this attempt to ruin\nBritain, even the court of France was obliged to\npreach the dotfirines of Liberty, and to take its chance\nthat Frenchman would confent to be the only flaves.\nBut their oihcers and foldiers, who returned from\nAmerica, imported the American principles, and in\nevery company found bearers who lifiened with de-\nlight and regret. to their fafcinating tale of American\nindependence.\n\f264 urns ramen mvorurron. eau. lvl\nindependence.

To import this dange~\nIous delicacy of American growth, France had ex-\npended many millions, and was drowned in debts.\nThe mad prodigality of the Royal Family and the\nCourt had drained the treafury, and foreflalled every\nlivre of the revenue. The edicts for new taxes and\nforced loans were moll unwelcome and oppreflive.\nThe \/ffuocais axparlefnefzf had nothing to do with\nflate-affairs, being very little more than barrillers in\nthe highefi Court of juflice; and the highell claim\n1\nof the Prelidents of this court was to be a fort of\nhumble counfellors to the King in common matters.\nIt was a\nvery Ptrange inconulteucy in that ingenious\nnation to\npermit fuch people to touch on thofe {iate~\niiilnjerfls; for, in fagfl, the King of France was an\nabfolute Monarch, and the fubje\u00e9ls were llaves. This\nis the refult of all their painful refearch, notwith~\nflanding that glimmerings of natural jullice and\nof freedom are to be met with in their records.\nThere could not be found in their hiflory fo\nmuch as a tolerable account of the manner of\ncalling\n\fQHAP. iv.

But\nall this was againll nature, and it was neceffary that\nit fhould come to an end, the firll time that the mo-\nnarch confeffed that he could not do every thing\nunlefs they put the tools into his hands. As things\nwere\napproaching gradually but rapidly to this con-\ndition,lthe impertinentinterference (for fo a French-\nman, fubjefi ofthe Grand Monarch, Hllffi think it)\nof the advocates of the Parliament of Paris was\npopu-\nlar in the highell degree ; and it mufi be confelied,\nthat in general it was\npatriotic, however inconhlient\nwith the conllitution. They felt themfelves plead-\ning the caufe of humanity and naturaljuilice. This\nwould ernbolden honeft and worthy men to\nfpeak\ntruth, however unwelcome to the court. In gene-\nral, it :null alfo be granted that they fpoke with cau-\ntion and with refpecl to the fovereign powers; and\nthey had frequently the pleafure of being the means\nof mitigating the burdens ofthe people. The Par-\nliament of Paris, by this condu\u00e9l, came to bellooked\nup to as a fort of mediator between the King and his\nfubjecls; and as the avocats faw this, they naturally\nIofe in their own eilirnation far above the rank in\nwhich the conllitution of their government had pla-\nced them. For it mull always be kept in mind, that\nthe robe was never conlidered as the drels of a No-\nbleman, although the cafiock was.

The defcendants of a\nMarquis de la Robe\nnever could rife to certain dignities in the church\nand at court. The avocats de la parlernent felt this,\nand frnarted under the excluhon from court-\nhonours; and though they eagerly courted fuch no-\nbility as they could attain, they feldom omitted any\nopportunity that occurred during their junior prac-\ntice, of expoiing the arrogance ofthe Nobleffe, and\nthe dominion of the court. This increafed their\npopularity, and in the prefent fituation of things,\nbeing certain of fupport, they went beyond their\nformer cautious bounds, and introduced in their\npleadings, and particularly in their joint remon-\nilrances againit the regiftration of edi\u00e9is, allthe wire-\ndrawn morality, and cofmo-political jurifprudence,\nwhich they had fo often rehearfed in the Lodges,\nand which had of late been openly preached by the\neconomifts and philofophers.\n4\nA hgnal was\ngiven to the nation for engaging\n\"\nen\nmatic\" in political difcufiion.

In ibort, in the courfe of ~a\nmonth, a'\nfpirit of licentioufnefs and a\nrage for in=\nnovation had completely pervaded the minds of\nthe Parilians. The molt confpicuons proof of this\nwas the unexpected fate of the Parliament.

A few months ago thefe would\nhave been joyfnlly received as the Magna Charta\nof Freedom, and really contained all that a Wife\npeople fhould defire; but becanfe the Parliament\nhad fometime before given it as their opinion as\nthe conllitntional counfel of the Crown, that the\nStates lhould be convoked on the principles of their\nlalt meeting in 1614, which preferved the diltinc-r\ntions of rank, all their pall fervices were\nforgotten\n-all their hard llruggle with the former admi-\nniflzration, and their unconquerable courage and\nperfeverance, which ended only with their down~\nful, all were\nforgotten; and thofe dillinguilhecl\nmembers\n\fthan iv. me rrusncn azvotufrron.\n269\nmembers Whofe Zeal and l`uH`erings ranked them\nwith the moft renovved heroes and martyrs of pa-\ntriotiliu, were now regarded as the contemptible\ntools of Ariliocracy.

Defprefl\nmenil was the firlt martyr of that Liberty and\nEquality which it was now boldly preaching,\nhaving voluntarily furrendered himfelf a prifoner\nto the oflicer fent to demand him from the Par-\nliament. He was alfo a\nmartyr to\nany thing that\nremained of the very fhadow of liberty after the\nRevolution, being guillotined by Robelpierre.\nI have already mentioned the intrigues of Count\nMirabeaii at the Court of Berlin, and his fedi-\ntious preface and notes on the anonymous letters\non the Rights of the Prullian States.

Mirabeau was therefore\nin a\nrage at the minifter, and publifhed a pam-\nphlet, in which his celebrated memorial on the\nRate of the nation, and_the means of relieving it,\nwas treated with the utmoft feverity of reproach;\nand in this conteft his mind was\nwrought up to\nthat violent pitch of oppolition which he ever af~\nter maintained.

It was one of the Amir Rezmiy, which had\nnow rid itl`elf of all the inligniiicant mylticifm of\nthe feet. This was now become troublefome, and\ntook up the time which would be much better\nemployed by the Chem:\/ferr du Soliel, and other\nftill more refined champions of reafon and uni-\nNerfal citizenfhip. Mirabeau had imparted to it\nfame of that Illumination which had beamed up-\non him when he was in Berlin. In 1733, he and\nthe Abbe were wardens ofthe lodge.

They were already fit for the\nhigher mylteries, and only wanted to learn the me-~\nthocls of buiinefs which had fucceeded fo well in\nfpreatling their dotflrines and maxims over Germa~\nny.

Their natural and immediate eii`e\u00e9`t on\nthe mind is to increafe the difeontents of the un-\nfortunate, and of thofe in the laborious ranks of life.\nNo one, even of the Illuminators, will deny that\nthofe ranks mutt be filled, if fociety exilis in any de-\ngree of cultivation whatever, and that there will al-\nways be a\ngreater number of men who have no far-\nther profpefft.

Such declamations naturally tend to\ncaufe men to make light of the obligations and du#\nties of common\npatriotifm, becaufe thefe are\nrepre-\nfented as luborclinate_ and inferior to the greater and\nmore noble affection of univerfal benevolence.

Perhaps national\nunion arifes from national animonty ;--but they are\nplainly difiinguiihable, and union is not neceliarily\nprodu\u00e9iive of injuliice. The fame arguments that\nhave any force againii patriotifm are\nequally good\nagainfi the preference which natural inliin& gives\nparents for their children, and furely no one can\ndoubt of the propriety of maintaining this in its\nfull force, fubje\u00e9t however to the precife laws of\njuliice.\nI\nBut I am in the wrong to adduce paternal or fi-\nlial affefiion in defence of patriotifm and loyalty,\nlince even thofe natural inliin\u00e9is are reprohated by\nthe I!\/zwzi1mz'z', as hofiile to the all-comprehending\nphilanthropy.

With cold hearts, and a\nmetaphyhcal\nfcale, we rneafure the prefeut miferies of our fellow\ncreatures, and compare them with the accumulated\nmiieries of former times, occaiioned through a courfe\nof ages, and afcribed to the ambition of Princes. In\nthis artificial manner are the atrocities of' France ex-\ntenuated; and we ftruggle, and partly fucceed, in\nreafoning ourfelves out of all the feelings which linh\nmen together in fociety.-The ties of father, hui'-\nband, brother, friend-#all are abandoned for an\nemotion which we muii even Iirive to excite,--uni#\nFerfal philanthropy; But this is fad perverlion of\nnature.\n\fCHAP. iv.

In all this C311-\nvaliing he never quits the great obie\u00e9l, the forming\nthe mind ofthe young man according to the princi-\nples of univerfal Liberty and Equality, and to\ngain\nthis point, fcruples not to flatter, and even to excite\nhis dangerous pallions.

Thisl may conclude from the im-\npreilion's being exhaulled in a few days, and be-\ncaufe the publilher informs me that another edi-\ntion is wanted immediately.

I fhould have made the difpolition more na-\ntural and perfpicuous, and have lopped oil' lbme\nredundances and repetitions.

I am the more delirous of doing this, be'-\ncaufe it feems to me that molt of the political\nwriters on the Continent, and many of my coun-\ntrymen, have not attended to important Circum-\nIltances which difiinguilh our eonllitution from the\nStates General of France and other Countries.\nThe republieans in France have, lince the Revo~\nlution, employed the pains in fearching their re-\ncords, which ought to have been talten before\nthe convocation of the States, and which would\nprobably have prevented that ilrep altogether.\nThey have lhewn that the meetings of the States,\nif we except that in 1614 and 1483, were uni-\nformly ocealions of mutual contelts between the\ndifferent Cirders, in which the interefts of the na-\ntion and the authority of the Crown were equally\nforgotten, and the kingdom was\nplunged into all\nthe horrors of a rancorous civil war. Of this\nthey give us a\nrennarkable inllzance during the\ncaptivity of King John in 1355 and 1356, the\nhorrors of which were\nhardly exceeded by any\nthing that has happened in our\ndays. They have\nfhewn the fame difrnal confequences of the HIYCHI-\nbly of the different Qrders in Brabant ; and llill\nmore\nremarkably in Sweden and Denmarlc, where\nthey have frequently produced a revolution and\nchange of government, all of which have termi-\nnated\n\f376 rosrci-uw.,\nnated in the abfblute government, either of thc.\nCrown, orof one of the contending Orders. They\nlaugh at the limplicity of the Eritilh for expe\u00e9iz-\ning that the permanent fruits of our conltitution,\nwhich is founded on the fame jarring principles,\n[hall be any better; and affert, that the peaceable\nexereife of its leveral powers for fomewhat more\nthan a\ncentury, (a thing never cxperienced by\nus in former times,) has proceeded from circum-\nftances merely accidental. With much addrefs\nthey have lelecited the former dilturbauces, and\nhave conne\u00e9ted them by a fort of principle, fo as\nto liipport their fyltem,\n\"\nthat a States General\n\"\nor Parliament, confilting of a reprefentation of\n\"\nthe different claffes of citizens, can never deli-\n\"\nberate for the general good, but muft always\n\"\noccupy their time in contentions about their\n\"\nmutual invaiions of privilege, and will faddle\n\"\nevery aid to the .executive power, with ionic\n\"\nunjult and ruinous aggrandifement of the vi\u00e9to-\n\"\nrious Order;7` They have the effrontery to\ngive the l\/[AGNA CHARTA as an inftance of an\nuliirpation of the great feudatories, and have re-\nprefented it in fuch a\nlight as to make it the game\nof their writers and of the tribunes.-#All this\nthey have done in order toreeoncile the minds of\nthe few thinking men of the nation to the aboli-\ntion of the different Orders of the State, and to\ntheir National Convention in the form of a chao-\ntic mals of Frenchmen, one and indivilible :\nNon berzejzmfiarum c\/y20r;lia_\/Erniiza rerzmz,\nU6ifrigizlapuegna5a1z! ralialis, \/Jumentia fcrfr,\nflffof\/ia cum durir, fueporzdcre badenfia pondus.\nTheir rcalbnings vt ould be juli, and their proofs\nfrom hiflor' would be cunvincinn' if their ,re-\n.7 ov\ndl\n,\nmiles\n\fPOSTSCRIPT., 371\nmiles were true; if the Britiih Parliament were\nreally an allembly of three Orders, either perfon-\nally, or\nby reprcientation, deliberating apart, each\nhaving a veto on the decilions of the other twa.\nAnd I apprehend that mofi of my countrymen,\nwho have not had occalion to canvas the fubjeft\nwith much attention, fuppofe this to be really the\nBritilh Conllitutionz for, in the ordinary table\nconverfations on the fnhjecft, they feldom go far~\nther, and talk with great complacence of the bal-\nance of hoftile powers, of the King as the umpire\nof diEerences, and of the peace and proiiuerity\nthat refults from the whole.\nBut I cannot help thinking that this is a mifcom\nception, almoft in every circunnitance. I do not\nknow any oppolite interefts in the State, except\nthe general one of the governor and the governed,\nthe king and the fubjerft.-\u00bb1f there is an\numpire\nin our conftitution, it is the houfe of Lords-but\nthis is not as a\nreprefentation of the perfons of\nbirth, but as a court of hereditary rnagil`trates:\nthe Peers do not meet to defend their own privi-\nleges as citizens, but either as the counfellors of\nthe King, or as\njudges in the lalt refort. The\nprivileges for which we fee them fometimes con-\ntend, are not the privileges of the high-horn, of\nthe great vaffals of the Crown, but the privileges\nof the Houfe of Lords, of the fupreme Court of\njndicature, or of the King's Council. In all the\nnations on the Continent, the difierent Orders, as\nthey are\ncalled, of the State, are corporations,\nbodies politic, which have jurifdi\u00e9tion within\nthemfelves, and rights which they can maintain\nat their own\nhand, and privileges which mark\nthem moft diftin\u00e9tly, and produce fuch a complete\nfeparation between the clilferent Orders, that they\ncan no more mix than oil and water. Yet the\ngreat\n\fQ72 rosrscnirri\ngreat preiiclent Montelbiuieu lays, that the lleerag\u00e9a\nof England is a\nlfociy of Nobility ; and he ufes the\nterm Zfody in the itri\u00e9t fenfe now mentioned, as\niy~\nnonymous to corporation. He has repeatedly uieei\nthis term to denote the feconcl order of ]?`rench~\nmen, perfons of noble birth, of ennobled, (that\nis, vefteci in the privileges and diitin\u00e9tions of the\nnobly born,) united by law, and having authority\nto maintain their privileges. The hilltory of\nFrance, nay of our own\ncountry, fhows us that\nthis body may enjoy all its diftinftions of nobility,\nand that the Great Barons may enjoy the preroga~\ntives of their baronies, although the authority of\nthe Crown is almoit annihilated.-'Ne have no\ncogent realon, therefore, for thinking that they\nwill be eonitantly careful to fupport the authority\nof the Crown ; and much lefs to believe that they\nwill, at the fame time, watch over the liberties\nof the people. In the ele\u00e9tion of their reprelenta-\ntives, (forthe whole body of the gentlemen muft ap-\npear by reprefentation,) we muft not expe\u00e9t that\nthey will feieit fueh of their own number as will\ntake care of thofe two effential objeets of our\ncon\u00bb\nititution.f,Etqually jealous of the authority ofthe\nCrown and of the encroachments of all thole who\nare not gentlemen, and even fearful of the all\niixrnptions of the Great Barons, the powerful in-\ndividuals of their own order, they will always\nehoofe fueh reprelentatives as will defend their\nown\nrights in the iirit place. Such peribns are by\nno means fit for maintaining the proper authority\nof\n,the Crown, and keeping the reprcfentativesot`\nthe lower Claffes within pro-per bounds.\nBut this is not the nature of our Howie of Lords\nin the prelenttlay. it was lo tbrnierly in a\ngreat\nmealiire, and had the fanie Ciiecfts as in other\neozmtries, Ent iinee the Revolution, the Peers\nof\n\fV\n\u00bb\nPOSTSCRIPT.\nof Great-Britain have no\nimportant priviieges which\nrelate merely or chieiiy to birth.

He fhows, unequeftionably,\nthat a formal and fyftematic confpiracy againil Re-\nligion was formed and zealoufly profecuted by Vol-\ntaire, d'Alembert, and Diderot, afiifted by Frede-\nric ll. King of Pruilia; and I fee that their princi-\nples and their manner of procedure have been the\nfame with thofe of the German athei{'ts and anar-\nchifts. Like them they hired an\nArmy of Writers;\nthey induftrioufly pufhed their writings into every\nhoufe and every cottage. Thofe writings were\nequally calculated for inflaming the fenfual appetites\nof men, and for Perverting theirjudgments. They\nendeavoured to get the command of the Schools,\nparticularly thofe for the lower clalTes; and they\n\u00fe\u00ffere \u00acted\nand managed a\nprodigious number of Cir-\nculating Libraries and Reading Societies. M. Bar-\nruel lays, that this gang of public corruptors have\nheld their meetings for many years in the Hotel dc\nHolbac\/9 at Paris, and that Voltaire was their hono-\nrary Preiident. The moft eminent members were\nd'\/flezfzberf, Diderot, C01m'orcet, La Hczflpe, Turgot,\nLfzmoigzzon. They took the name of(]2coNoM1sTs,\nand affected to be continually occupied with plans\nfor improving Commerce, Manufactures, Agricul-\nture, Finance, &c. and publilhed from time to\ntime re{'pe\u00e9`table performances on thofe fubje6ls.--\nBut their darling project was to deltroy Chriflianity\nand all Religion, and to bring about a total\nChang;\n0\n\frosrscizrpr.\n383\nof Government. They employed Writers to com-\npofe corrupting and impious books--Lhefe were\nrevifed by the Society, and corrected till they fuited\ntheir purpofe. A number were printed in a hand-\nfomemanner, to defray the expence; and then a\nmuch greater number were printed in the cheapeit\nform poflible, and given for nothing, or at\nvery\nlow prices, to hawkers and pedlars, with injunctions\ntodiltribute them fecretly through the cities and\nvillages.

Defpiling the incenfe of\nfuch wrenches, and detelting their fcience, he has truly merited.\nthe title of P\/Ji\/Mzpber, by having done more for the real Illu-\nmination ofthe World, by the promotion of true Science, than\nLouis XIV. with his penlioned Academicians, or than all the\nprefent Sovereigns of Europe united ; and has uniformly diflin-\nguifhed himfelf by his regard for true Religion, and every thing\nthat is venerable and facred.

I recolleft, indeed, that\nNicholai, in his account of the German Roiyeru-\nCians, fays, that the obje5t of Free .flylafonry in\nEngland, iince the time ofjames ll. is\" Qlblemflon in\nReligious Opifzloizs, as\nRoyfzlyifz had been the objefl;\nbefore that time.\nThe account which the Abbe gives of the Che-\nwlerie du Soleil is very conformable to one of the\nthree rituals in my poifeflion. His account of the\nClaeftfalerle ale Rye Crolxfand fome others, differs\nconiiderably 'H-om thofe in my box. I have reafon\nto think that my materials are\ntranfcripts from the\nrituals, (Sec. which Rofa introduced into the Ger-\nrnan\nLodges, becaufe the writer of the greatcft part\nofthem is an inhabitant ofthat city.\nI think that the Abbe Barruel's account of this\nmatter fuggefts a\npleahng reiiecftion. All the Bre-\nthren on the Continent agree in faying, that Free\nI\/lafonry was\nimported from Great Britain about\nthe beginning of this century, and this in the form\noi' a\nMyitical Society. It has been aiiiduouily cul-\ntivated in Britain ever ince that time, and Ibelieve\nthat the Fraternity is more numerous here, in pro-\nportion to the population of the country, than in\nany other kingdom; yet in Britain the Brethren\nhave never\nfufpecfted that its principles were fedi-\ntious or atheiftical. 'While the Free`l\/laionry of\nthe Continent was tricked upiwith all the frippery\nof Ftars and ribands, or was perverted to the' rinolt\nprofiigate and impious purpofes, and the Lodges\nbecame feminaries of Foppery, of Sedition, and\nImpiety, it has retained in Britain its original form,\n` ` i\niimple\n\fPOSTSCRIPT.\n385\nfimple and unadorned, and the Lodges have re-\nmained the fcenes ofinnocent merrirnent, or meet-\nings of Charity and Benehcence.

I\nthink, however, that nothing can more\nefteftnally\nremove it, than Whatl have already hiown of' the\nvile and diigraceful tricks which thele ibphiits have\nbeen guilty of to\nfupport their caufe. The caufe\nof this numerous affociation is diltinitiy feen in their\nvery procedure. The very firlt [tep in their pro-\ngrefs is ci\u00a2\u00b0J_z>1'awz'ion J fimzzzzerr. In this they have\nlaboured with as much earneltnefs as either Sparta-\ncus, or Minos, or Bahrdt. It was a treat to me to\nlearn that La Clofe's abominable bool; Le; Ling?-\u00bb:zs\nD\u00a2\u00a7;;\u00a7uf~w_9'2'J,\n\f386 Pos'rscR1rr.\nDfmgerezyes, was not merely pandering for his pa~\ntron Orleans, but alfo working for his mafters at\nthe Hotel d'I-Iolbach. Nothing gives fuch certain\nbread to thoie authors, in the beginning of their\ncareer, as immoral and impure writings ;-and with\niiich did even their chief fet out, and fill his pock-\nets; witnefs his Pucelle \u00a2i'Orlmm\u00b0; and even after\nthey became the frzges qf France, they continued,\neither from eoarfe tafie or from lerious principle,\nfor the diabolical purpofe of inflarning the paliions\nof others, to interlard their graveft performances\nwith impure thoughts and fentiments. Nay, the\nfecret of the Hotel d'Holbach fhews us that, for\nany thing we know to the contrary, the vileft pro-\ndu\u00e9lions of their prefs may have been the compofi-\ntions ofthe octogenary Voltaire, ofthe Ily d'Alem-\nbert, or of the author of the Pere de Fami\/\/e. VVhat\na\npity it is that the Dedine qf the Roman _Empire was\nnot all written in England, and that its learned and\nelegant author, by going into their fociety, has\nallowed himfelf to be drawn into this muddy and\ndegrading vortex l\nI fhould fcarcely aik for more to\ndifgufl me with\nthe philofophy of theie fages, and to make me dif-\ntruii; all their preteniions to knowledge. The\nmcannefs ofthe conduit fuited the original poverty\nof the whole of them, but its continuance Ptrips\nthem of all claims to the name of philofophers.\nTheir pretended wifdom is only cunning,-and we\nmu{'t acknowledge that their conduct was clever:\nfor this mean of corruption, concealed or embel-\nlifhed by their talents for fentimental (lang, (I can\ngive it no better name,) made their converfation\nand their writings moft acceptable to their noble\npatrons.-Now it is that Religion, of neceliity,\ncomes on the iield; for Religion tells us, that thefe\n`\nare\n\fPosfrscarpfr.\n387\nare mean pleafures for creatures born to our prof-\npefts; and Chriflianity tells us, that they are\ngrofs\ntranfgreliions of the 01zZyjzW mom\/ign The progrefs\nof the pupil will now be rapid; for he will liften\nwith willing ears to leffons which Hatter his pal-\nIions. Yet Voltaire thinks it necefliary to enliven\nthe leH`0ns by a little of the _\/rzlawn, guelr\/ues 50775\nmoi: fi-_propos aupr\u00e9r der fmzmes, which he recom~\nmends to d'Alembert, who, it feems, was deficient\nin this kind offmall talk.\nSurely all this is very unlike to wifdom; and\nwhen we fee that it is part of a\nplan, and this an\nobvious one, it Ihould greatly lelfen our wonder at\nthe number of thefe admired infidels. If we would\nnow\nproceed to examine their pretenhons to fcience,\non which they found their claim to the name of\nphilofophers, we mu{'t be careful to take the word\nin a fenfe that is unequivocal. Its true\nmeaning is\nby no means what is commonly alligned to it, a\nlover ofknowledge. It is a lover of wifdom; and\nphilofophy profeffes to teach us what are the con-\nlltituents of human felicity, and what are the means\nof attaining it; what are our duties, and the gene-\nral rules for our \u00fe\u00ffcondu \u00act.The Iloics were\nphilo-\nfophers. The Chrillians are alfo philolophers.\nThe Epicureans and the Sophills of France would\nalfo be called philoibphers. I have put in my ob-\nje\u00e9lion to this claim already, and need not\nrepeat\nmy reafons for laying that their doftrines are not\ndictates of' wifdom. I fhall only add, that their\nown conduit [hows plainly that their principles had\nno ellerft on themfelves, becaulie we fee, from the\nferies of correfpondence which Mr. Barruel has laid\nbefore us, that they do not\nfcruple to pra\u00e9lile vil-\nlanous and hypocritical tricks, which never fail to\ndifgrace a man, and are\ntotally irreconcilable with\nour\n\f388 \u00bbPosTsceaiz='r.\nour notions of human dignity. Voltaire patiently\ntook a\ncaning from an ofiicer at Frankfort, for ha-\nving wittily told lies of his fcholar Frederic, and\nhis wifdom told him that his honour was cleared by\no1\u00b0r\"ei'itig to meet the hiajor, each of them provided\nwith an\ninjection fyringe. This was\nthought fub-\nlime wit at\nFerney. I do not\nfuppofe that the Have\nEpi\u00e9lietus, or the foldier Digby, would have ended\nthe afiiair in this manner. Fviany ofthe deeds of\nwifdom of the club d'l-lolbach were more\ndegrading\nthan even this; and I am confident that the whole\nof' this phalanx of fages were confcious that they\nwere treated by their patrons and pupils as Voltaire\nwas treated by the Solomon ot' the North, and that\ntheir notions of the \u00fe\u00ff'Ui'(ii \u00ac_J\/C\/Zglfai\u00e9'were alto the fame\nwith his. He gives this account of it in his letter\nto his niece: \"\nLe Roi lui avoit repondu; 'j'aurai\n\"\nsbefoin de \"o_ltaire un an tout au\nplus-Un preffe\n\"\nVorange, ct on\n_jette l'\u00e9corce.' _le me fuis fait\n\"\nrepeter ces douces paroles\"--(How poor Vol-\ntaire would grin 1)-\" je vois bien qu'on a\npreff\u00e9\n\"\nl'orange--il faut penfer it fauver l'ecorce.\"\nBut, as\nthings itand at\nprefent, philofopher means\na man of fcience, and in this fenfe of the word our\nfages claim great refpe\u00e9t. No claim can be Worfe\nfounded. It is amuhng to obferve the earneftneis\nwith which they recommend the iludy of natural\nhiftory. One does not readily fee the connection\nof this with their oftenlible object, the happinefs of\nman. A perufal of Voltaire's letters betrays the\niecret. Many years ago he heard that fome obfer-\nvations on the formation of Ptrata, and the foilils\nfound in them, were\nincompatible with the age\nwhich the Mofaic hiiiory ieems to ailign to this\nglobe. He mentions this with great exultation\nin fome of his early letters; and, nom that time\nforward,\n\fPOSTSCRIPT.\n339\nforward, never ceafes to enjoin his colleagues to\nprefs the iludy of natural hiilory anal eofniogony,\nand carefully to bring forward every feel: which was\nhollile to the D\/lofaic acceizlzfisa. lt beeamf: a ferieus\npart of the exerciii\u00e9s ef their v:e,.;lr\u00a7:j: pugigs, and\ntheir perplexing diiizoveries tnrii; fQCI{;'.\"lOl1lNlY\ncliizolayecl. lvl. cle Luc, a mtxiiiezitn:f:;;r;<+l%li;, mtxiiiezit n:f:;;r;<+l%li;,\nhas ihewn, in a letter to tht; tiV$7l;f?i' E); lQ'i;n-\nmermann, {r31_xbliig;e\u00a2:i, ft\u00a7.ii'r\u00a7;, ahrvtwz f' _;;\ntg'\nhow very ikfafity the \u00fe\u00ffl3\u00a7i`t~i\"V3fl'\u00act\u00a7lf*;&?uf 3 .iZ1\u00a7lE1'\\'C\u00a7'S\nhas been, and how preeijzireiie Eififxe tfeir eeri-\nelunons.
