Duminda remembered having been chief monk in a famous temple and exhibited appropriate concerns and demeanour, for instance with regard to dress and religious activities. He recited stanzas in Pali, the ancient language of Buddhism that is generally only known by monks.

He also exhibited monk-like behaviours, wishing to carry his clothes as monks do, dress in monk\u2019s clothes and be addressed as \u2018little monk'.&nbsp;He was fond of reciting stanzes in Pali, the extinct Buddhist ritual language, and&nbsp;frequently expressed a wish to visit temples and become a monk.\n\nThis case was investigated&nbsp;&nbsp;Erlendur Haraldsson and his Sri Lankan colleague Godwin Samararatne. Haraldsson reported it first in a journal paper and later in a book,&nbsp;I Saw a Light and Came Here, which he co-authored with&nbsp;James Matlock1 In the early 1990s, BBC Wales made a documentary on cases of rebirth,&nbsp;In Search of the Dead,&nbsp;in which Duminda\u2019s case was included.2&nbsp;&nbsp;  Duminda's Statements\n\nDuminda stated that he had been a senior monk (nayake-hamduruvo) or chief monk (loku-hamduruvo) at the Asgiriya Temple. With regard to his death, he said he had felt a pain in the chest and fell, then was taken to hospital, where he died. Describing this, he used the word apawathwuna, a term used only for the death of monks. He also said that:&nbsp;   \tHe had owned a red car. \tHe had been teaching the apprentice monks. \tHe had an elephant. \tHe had friends in the Malvatta monastery and used to visit it.\n\nHe&nbsp;expressed a longing for the money-bag and radio he had possessed in Asgiriya. He said that&nbsp;after he died and before he was born again&nbsp;he had lived among the devas (angelic beings).  Duminda's Behaviours\n\nDuminda behaved in many ways consistent with the monk he believed he had been. He:   \twore and treated his clothes like a monk \trequested a monk\u2019s robe and fan \twanted to wear a monk\u2019s robe (seldom allowed) \tdisliked his mother calling him \u2018son\u2019 and asked to be called podi sadhu (little monk) \texpressed a wish to become a monk \texpressed a wish to visit the local vihara (place of worship) \ttook wild flowers to the vihara two or three times a day on Poya-day (Buddhist monthly holiday), as monks do \ttried to build a vihara at home, like children building toy structures \tdisliked killing insects or perceived wrongdoings to anyone \toften expressed a wish to go to the Asgiriya temple and the neighbouring Malvatta temple \tdisplayed knowledge of Pali (the ancient language of Buddhism) reciting a few religious stanzas while holding the fan in front of his face, in the monkish manner \tdisplayed calmness, serenity and detachment rarely found in children of his age \tdid not like to play with other children\n\nCertain incidents reinforced the perception that Duminda remembered having been a monk. For instance, he once reprimanded his mother when she wanted to help wash his hands (women are not supposed to touch a monk\u2019s hands). On a visit to Asgiriya temple he did not want to sit down until brought a white cloth to sit on, as is customary for monks.  Duminda's Xenoglossy\n\nThe Duminda case&nbsp;exhibits the rare feature of xenoglossy, utterances in a language that the speaker has never learned. He liked to recite stanzas (short religious statements) in Pali, the ancient language of&nbsp;Buddhism that is learned only by monks. Duminda had never learned Pali.\n\nIn the BBC documentary&nbsp;In Search of the Dead, Duminda was brought to a temple and asked to recite some stanzas, which he did in the presence of many monks. All the stanzas except one were recognized by the monks, and&nbsp;the exception was discovered after a lengthy search, inscribed in an obscure place in the Asgiriya temple.&nbsp;\n\nOne possible explanation for Dumind'a knowledge of the stanza was that he had been taught thems by his grandmother, but she denied that she had done so. Also, religious stanzas were recited on the national radio at 5 in the morning, although no child is known to have learned such verses in this way.\n\nIt is&nbsp;worth noting that when Duminda recited the stanzas he held a fan in front of his face, as monks customarily do. However,&nbsp;It is not known whether Duminda understood the meaning of the verses he recited.  Case Investigation  Interviews with the Family\n\nErlendur Haraldsson learned about this case in 1988. With Godwin Samararatne he travelled to the family\u2019s home, some sixteen miles from Kandy, and interviewed Duminda and family members. Duminda, then only four years old, was shy and did not say much. His mother, grandmother and grandfather said that since he was three, they had witnessed his extraordinary monk-like behaviour and heard him talk about his memories. &nbsp;\n\nHaraldsson and Samararatne interviewed him again a year later, at which time he repeated the same statements. His mother also said that when the death of the chief monk of the Malvatta temple was announced over the radio, he told his family that he had known him. When the mother briefly left the room, the grandfather added that she had not mentioned two further statements: that Duminda had missed his radio and money-bag, items that monks are not normally allowed to possess.\n\nDuminda\u2019s calm detachment and dignity were evident to the investigators in comparison with his two brothers, who like normal healthy boys would never be quiet or still for long.\n\nThe family had no relative or neighbour who was a monk. There existed no ties of any kind between any member of Duminda\u2019s family and the Asgiriya monastery. They had not visited the monastery until they eventually took the boy there in 1987, following his repeated requests. The boy\u2019s mother had been reluctant to go there, fearing that the boy might later leave her to become a monk, as indeed he later did.  Search for the Previous Personality\n\nA journalist from the Sri Lankan newspaper&nbsp;Island learned about the case and was present during Duminda\u2019s visit to Asgiriya. He quickly decided that the boy had been referring to the Venerable&nbsp;Ratanapala, a senior monk who had died of a heart attack in 1975.\n\nHowever, Haraldsson learned from three monks that Ratanapala had&nbsp;owned neither a car nor an elephant; he had no personal income, hence no money bag; he did not preach, hence did not use the fan; and he&nbsp;had no connection with the Malvatta monastery. Besides, Ratanapala had been known for his interest in politics. This did not fit Duminda's statements and excluded Ratanpala as a candidate for the life Duminda was talking about.\n\nHaraldsson needed to determine which monks:   \thad income from the temple (money-bag) \thad connections with the Malvatta temple\/monastery and the Temple of the Tooth (served by the Asgiriya monastery) \thad frequent occasions to visit these places \thad friends there \thad preached sermons and exhorted laymen to recite the Buddhist precepts, thus using a monk\u2019s fan \thad often used a red car \thad a heart condition, fell down, and died in hospital \towned a radio and an elephant\n\nHe obtained the names of all five abbots who had run the monastery in Asgiriya from the beginning of the 1920s to 1975, the year in which the abbot took office at the time he was investigating the case.\n\nThe life of the abbot Gunnepana Saranankara, who was the abbot from 1921 to 1929, fit&nbsp;each of the eight specific statements listed above. The chief monk (mahanayaka) of Asgiriya had owned a car and a money-bag. Gunnepana had taught other monks, had suffered a sudden pain in his chest, had fallen on the floor and been taken to&nbsp;hospital, where he died. He had preached, which is not the case for all monks.\n\nGunnepana was not thought to have actually owned either an elephant or a radio. However, Gunnepana had showed a particular interest in an elephant a disciple of his had brought&nbsp;to the neighbourhood.&nbsp;He owned a gramophone, and it is possible that this is what Duminda was remembering when he referred to a radio.\n\nEvery one of Duminda\u2019s statements fit&nbsp;the life of the chief monk Gunnepanna, whereas only some fit&nbsp;the lives of some of the other chief monks.&nbsp;The conclusion seemed clear that Duminda was remembering the life of the abbot Gunnepana.  Duminda\u2019s Later Life\n\nIn his late childhood, Duminda\u2019s parents yielded to his persistent wish to become a monk. He entered a monastery closely associated with Asgiriya and remained there for many years, but he&nbsp;became very interested in computers and proficient in using them. When he was around twenty years old he left the monastery \u2013 on good terms with the residing monks \u2013 and started to work for a company that set up security cameras. Later he entered university and earned a degree in computer science. He works now for a major state institution. He is married, has a family and is an active campaigner against alcoholism among the young in Sri Lanka.\n\nErlendur Haraldsson  Literature\n\nHaraldsson, E., &amp;&nbsp;Samararatne. G. (1999).
