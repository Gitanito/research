He moved to Los Angeles in 1925, becoming a successful illustrator of books and magazines while still in his teens; he also created science fiction fantasy paintings. His works are widely distributed in galleries around the world and are also found in US government buildings.1 He married Marjorie Ann Brinkman in 1957.  Psychical Research\n\nBayless was a member of the Society for Psychical Research, the American Society for Psychical Research and the Parapsychological Association. His eight books on psychical research covered poltergeists, animal apparitions and other apparitional phenomena, direct voice mediumship, phone calls from the dead, evidence of postmortem survival, and the nature of the after-life. He also published a book on his personal experiences and investigations.2\n\nBayless was critical of what he believed to be an excessive focus on experimental work and statistical analysis in modern parapsychology, preferring the investigation of spontaneous phenomena.3 He considered that most claims could be attributed to fraud and delusion, while insisting that a fraction were real.4 &nbsp;He planned to publish a paper on methods of fakery in the production of spirit photography; however, this was not completed.5\n\nBayless is thought to have been the first to discover so-called electronic voice phenomena, consisting of whispers and raps heard on otherwise silent tape recordings. He reported his first long series of experiments, which had begun in 1956 with Attila von Szalay in Los Angeles, in the Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research in January, 1959.6 He theorized that raps may not be caused by spirit energy alone, but rather a psychokinetic force which might also be influenced or modified by spirit stimulus.7 The phenomenon only received widespread notice with the later publication of books by Friedrich J\u00fcrgenson (Voice Transmissions with the Deceased, 1967)&nbsp;and Konstantin Raudive (Breakthrough: An Amazing Experiment in Electronic Communication with the Dead, 1971). &nbsp;\n\nBayless collaborated with D Scott Rogo to produce the book Phone Calls from the Dead8 which described cases and speculated on possible sources and mechanics.\n\nAt the time of his death, Bayless was preparing a book of reminiscences which included information about metal-bending, luminous effects, the religious apparitions at Zeitun and the physical phenomena he experienced with his wife.9  After-Death Contacts\n\nAccording to his wife Marjorie Brinkman, Bayless told her he would return after his death to prove that he had survived. She subsequently claimed to have seen his apparition five days after he died, and in later months to have experienced other phenomena such as touches, foorsteps, door openings and closing, and raps.10  Selected Books\n\nThe Enigma of the Poltergeist&nbsp;(1967).
