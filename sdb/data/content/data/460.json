[Oct., 1889.\nSome other matters ofroutine business were attended to, and the next\nMeeting of the Council was fixed for Friday, October 4th, at 4.30 p.m.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nA General Meeting was held at the Westminster Town Hall, on\nMonday, July 8th, at 8.30 p.m., the President, Professor Sidgwick, in\nthe chair.\nThe PRESIDENT made some remarks on the census of hallucinations\nnow in progress, describing the objects and methods of investigation\nand the progress so far made. The number of answers received\namounted at that time to about 1,600. He concluded by asking for\nthe co.operation of all interested in the work of the Society, whether\nas believers or disbelievers in telepathy, stating that he would be glad\nto send the necessary papers to anyone willing to help.\nMR. MYERS read a paper on\" Recognised Apparitions Occurringmore\nthan a Year after Death,\" quoting several cases in which the phantasm\nconveyed information previously unknown to the percipient, or in\nwhich it was seen by several persons, or on other grounds could not be\nclassed as a purely subjective hallucination. The paper will appear in\nthe next number of the Proceedings.\nMR. WHITE, commenting on Mr. Myers' paper, objected that he\ntook for granted the question of a future life, and that the evidence of\nintelligent people about ghosts was not more valuable than that of\nothers, since they were equally subject to hallucinations.\nMR. MYERS replied that he did not assume the existence of\ndisembodied spirits, but that the evidence under discussion went to\nprove it, and that the cogency of the evidence was not affected by the\nquestion whether the experiences were hallucinations or not, but\ndepended on there being some coincidence with objective fact, or other\ncharacteristic, to distinguish them from ordinary hallucinations.\nMR. BARKWORTH remarked that though it seemed most probable\nthat apparitions, even when veridical, were to be regarded as hallucina-\ntions and not as objective phenomena, still this should not be too\nhastily assumed. We must keep our minds open and not reject evidence,\nin whatever direction it might point.\nCASES RECEIVED BY THE LITERARY COMMITTEE.\nCOLLECTIVE CASES.\nThe following case was sent to us by Mrs. Wood, of 4, The Avenue,\nColchester, who obtained it in course of collecting answers for the\nDigitized by Google\n\fOct.. 1889.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 139\nhallucination census. A less complete account of the incident was\nsent to us in 1883.\nU. 4, Collective. [1889]\nIn 1852, betweeu 8.30and 9.p.m., in either the last week in July, or the first\nweek in August, on a fine, clear, light:evening, I, (Mrs. C.) then 14years ofage,\nand my sister, Mrs. H., then aged 12 years, were shutting a window looking\nout on the drive up to the front of our father's house, and on to a large open\nlawn; my first cousin, a lad aged 141, was in the next room, in which was a\nwindow with the same view. We three clearly saw the figure of a small\nwoman or young girl, dressed in white, with a white covering over her head\nlike a hood, coming acr088 the lawn in front of us, and then, passing through\na field the figure disappeared. Her mode of progre88ion struck us as being\nvery strange; she made a slight pause occasionally, and then resumed her\nfonner pace with a jerk. Her hands were somewhat raised and clasped, but\nshe sometimes unclasped them, making a movement that seemed like wringing\nthem. Two old ponies were tethered at some little distance from each other\nOD the lawn; she paSlled between them; they were both much frightened and\nran wildly round and round ; this was seen by a fourth person who came into\nthe room just as the figure disappeared. The ponies were in the habit of\nseeing people pass them and never took any notice of strangers or others.\nMy sister, my cousin, and myself were in good health and good spirits. The\nonly girl or persOIl of the same stature as this figure living in the nei!(hbour-\nbood was the tlaughter of my father's bailiff, and at the first sight of the figure\nmy cOllsin exclaimed \"It must be---ill her night-dre88!\" I knew the\ngirl was not likely to be there at that hour, and on inquiry of her mother\nthe next morning, we were told the girl was not well and had never left her\nbed the previous day. I may add, the figure came from an opposite dh'ection\nto that of the bailiff's house.\nIn the year 1854 my sister and I heard for the first time that there was\nan old legend connected with the house and grounds. We were told by a\nlady (now deceased) that in a book, giving an account of some of the--\ncounties, there wasa historyattached to thegrounds of--Hall. This history I\nhave never read, but I was told that its purport was, that a girl in the reign\nof Henry VIII. had been ill-treated, and ill her novice or nun's dre88 dragged\nacros\" the land and drowned in a lake that had been partially drained, in fact,\nwas a mere bog, long before my father bought the place.\nMy sister is living, my collsin is dead. He became an officer in the army,\nand when serving in the West Indies (or Honduras), he met with the son of\nthe gentleman who owned--Hall before my father bought it. This young\nman happened to relate the apparition of the nUll to a third person in the\npresence of my cousin, and there could be 110 doubt he was speaking of that\nwhich my cousin had ~een.\nAs the legend refers to a curse invoked by the nun on the po88es80rs of\nthe land, and as that land has now paBBed out of the p08lle8Bion of our family,\nit is not desirable that any names should be mentioned in relating the story,\nas a belief in it might cause anxiety and probably diminish the value of the\nproperty. I once related the story to Mr. Justice Wightman in the presence\nDigitized by Google\n\f140 JO'Umat of Society for Psychical Research. [Oot., 1889.\nof Mr. Matthew Arnold, and the judge croued-questioned me closely, and he\nexpressed himself to the effect that it was one of the most inexplicable and\nyet one of the beat authenticated stories of the kind he had ever heard.\nThe house was purchased by my father in 1851. We saw the figure in\n1852, and never heard of the legend till the summer of 1854. I cannot now\ngive the date when my cousin saw the BOn of the former proprietor, but it\nwas several years later. (Signed)--\nMrs. C.'s sister, Mrs. H'I adds:-\n\"My first cousin . . . was in the next room . . . We called to\nhim to look at the figure, and he saw just what we did. . . . I have\nread the account Mrs. C. has written, and it tallies with my recollections.\"\nG. 184, Collective.\nFrom Mrs. Willett, Bedales, Lindfield, Haywards' Heath,\nCOpy OF ENTRY IN BoOK.\nBedales, December, 1886.\nOn Saturday, December lith, about 4, or 4.15 p.m., my eldest child Dorothy,\naged nearly thirteen, was standing in the hall talking to MiBB 8 - , the\nschoolmistreBB at Scaynes Hill, when they both saw what appeared to them to\nbe a little child in a white pinafore running along the gallery, but they heard\nno BOund of footsteps. MiBB S---was just going away, and went towards\nthe garden door. Dorothy, thinking her little cousin, Ralph Bagnell, aged\nnearly three, who is now living with us while his parents are in India, was\non his way downstairs from the nursery, and might fall downstairs, went,\nexpecting to meet him: but neither the child nor anyone else was ill the\ngallery, or on the stllirs. Subsequent inquiry in the nursery proved that the\nchild had not left the room between his going upstairs about 3 o'clock,\nand coming down again about 5. Dorothy came into the morning-room\nwhere I was sitting, talking to a friend. She told me what she haei seen as\nsoon as this friend had left-about 4.30; I asked her for a description of the\nchild. She said it seemed to have fair hair like Ralph's and had apparently a\ndark frock and white pinafore, and ran along the gallery very quickly, only she\nheard no sound. I did not understand from her at first that Miss S---\nhad been with her until this evening (Sunday, December 12th,) when at tea-\ntime Miss 8-being here, I told her what the child said she had seen,\nwhen Miss S---said \"Oh I I saw a little child in a white pinafore run\nquickly along the gallery, and mllcIe sure it was Master Ralph; I saw the\nhead of the child with fair hair, and he had on a white pinafore. It was as\nI was standing talking to Miss Dorothy in the hall, just as I was going away,\nabout 4.15. She went upstairs and I went out at the garden door.\"\nI wroteout this directlyafter tea [i.e., on Sunday, December 12th, 1886. F.P.]\nDorothy has a very great objection now to anything being said about this,\nand as I found she was so averse to saying anything if asked, I prevailed on\nher to make a note in my book. It is this-\"On Saturday, December 11th,\n1886, about four O'clock, I was standing in the hall talking to MiBB S---\nI looked up and saw, as I thought, R. Bagnell rnn along the gallery. It\nhad a dark frock and white pinafore on. MiBB S---was just going and\nDigitized by Google\n\fOct., 1889.] JO'Urnal of Society for P8'!Jchical Research. 141\nwent out of the side door; I went upstairs quite expecting to meet Ralph,\nbut no one was there. Kate told us he had not been out of the nursery.-\nD.M.K.W., NO'\/Jember 9th, 1887.\"\nJuly 25th, 1888.\nDorothy, who bas seen the child I told you about, is the most matter-of-\nfact, practical, and unimaginative girl possible. I see you ask me if she has\nhad any other hallucination. When we were living at the Vicarage, West\nBromwich (Dorothy was, I think, abont five at the time this happened), she\nwent out of the dining-room to go into the drawing-room to fetch a wool-\nneedle, but came running back in great alarm, saying she had seen a\n\"grinning ugly face\" looking at her over the top of some curtains that\ndivided the half from the entrance lobby. I went with her at once, expecting\nto find some one had been hiding behind the curtain, but no one was to be\nseen, and when she showed me where the face was, I saw at once that no one\ncould possibly have been up at the top, looking over the curtain-pole, unless\nthey had been on steps. I asked Dorothy only a short time since again\nabout this, and she said she should never forget that face, and his horrid\nwicked look. At the time, of course, I made light of it, but for a long time\nshe wonld not go upstairs past those curtains alone-also I remember soon\nafter we came here in 1881, Dorothy told me she had seen a white figure going\nalong the gallery; near where she afterwards saw the little child. I did not\nthink much of this at the time, as it was dusk when she saw it.\nYon ask me how our hall was lighted that December afternoon at 4.15.\nIt is a very large hall, and at the end is a large bay window running the\nwhole height to the roof and admitting, of course, much light. I was sitting\nin the morning-room at the time, and it was light enough for me not to\nrequire any artificial light-this room faces north, but the hall window is\nsouth-the gallery runs along the north side of the hall.\nThere have been very curious sights and sounds in this house. Much all\nI have wished it I have never seen any thing-but I have twice heard quite\nunaccountable noises, like the breaking of crockery. I make a rule now of at\nonce writing down any of these strange things.\nMARY WILLETT.\nIn reply to a letter from us, asking for an independent account, Miss\nS-- writes :-\n\"St. Augustine's House, Scaynes Hill, Lindfield, Haywards' Heath.\n\" September 3M, 1888.\n\" I have not time now to say more than that my account would be almost\nword for word the same as that which Mrs. Willett sent you; since she wrote\nthe account in her journal in my presence directly after the occurrence, and\nI saw the copy sent to you.\"\nAfterwards we sent Miss S--- a copy of the account sent by Mrs.\nWillett, which she returned with\" Quite correct, Eleanor 8-,\" written\nbelow. In another letter she says: \"I am a very ma.tter-ot-fact person,\nand never had any hallucination in my life.\"\nDigitized by Google\n\f142 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Oct., 1889\nUNCONSCIOUS IIIIPRESSIONS REVIVED IN DREAlIIS.\nThe following account received from Mrs. Bickford-Smith seems to\nbe a very clear case of an impression, unconsciously received or\nforgotten, being revived in a dream. Such latent memory has been\nmentioned in some of the discussions in the Procedings as a probable\nexplanation of certain dreams, and we think that from this point\nof view, the following case will be found to have very considerable\ninterest:-\nFebruary 4th, 1889.\nOn reaching Morley's Hotel at 5 o'clock on Tuesday, 29th January,\n1889, I missed a gold brooch, which I supposed I had left in a fitting room\nat Swan and Edgar's. I sent there at once, but was very disappointed to\nhear that after a diligent search they could not find the brooch. I was very\nvexed, and worried about the brooch, and that night dreamed that I should\nfind it shut up in a number of the Queen newspaper that had been on the\ntable, and in my dream I saw the very page where it would be. I had\nnoticed one of the plates on that page. Directly after breakfast I went to\nSwan and Edgar's and asked to see the papers, at the same time telling the\nyoung ladies about the dream, and where I had seen the brooch. The papers\nhad been moved from that room, but were found, and to the astonishment of\nthe young ladies, I said, \"This is the one that contains my brooch\"; and\nthere at the very page I expected I found it.\nA. M. BICKFORD-SIUTH.\nWe received a substantially similar account from Mrs. Bickford-\nSmith's brother-in-law, Mr. B. A. Smith, who was a witness of the\ntrouble taken to find the brooch, both at the hotel, and by sending to\nSwan and Edgar's on the previous evening.\nThe following, though less clearly so, is probably a case of the\nsame kind. We have the independent account of the dreamer himself,\nwritten two years later, but as it is somewhat disjointed we prefer to\ngive that kindly sent to us by Miss Ada Hunt, of Pen Villa, Yeovil,\nwhich has the further advantage of having been written at the time.\nThe following rather remarkable dream took place on the 20th November,\n1886. On that day I gave to our gardener, G. Wilmot, his wages, 15s., in a\nhalf-sheet of paper, some letters to post, and two parcels and a note to leave\nat various houses on his way home. This was at 6 o'clock in the evening.\n. . . About an hour after, the gardener returned to tell me he had lost his\nwages. I advised him to carefully retrace his steps and make every inquiry,\nbut this he did without success; and as it was\" fair\" night and the town\nfull of people, he at last gave it up as hopeless and returned to his home\nquite a mile distant. During the night he dreamt that he went to one of the\nhouses where he had left a note, and, crossing the road after leaving it, he\nwalked into a mud heap, and that there his foot strock the paper containing\nDigitized by Google\n\f()ct.. 1889.] J01J,r'TWl Of Society for Psychical Re8earch. 143\nthe money; the half-sovereign rolled away and the 5s. remained under his\nfoot. He told his wife the dream, and falling asleep again he dreamt the\nsame dream again. Early in the morning he went to the place a.nd found\nhis dream fulfilled to the letter, even to the roIling away of the gold, and\nthe silver remaining in its place.\nHe is a most intelligent, truthful man. . .\nThe gardener's own account differs from t.his in gtvmg fewer\ndetails as to the dream; his account of it is: \"I dreamt I had found it\nand kicked the half-sovereign off the heap.\" Miss Hunt thinks that\nhis nervousness at writing himself made him forget to say that he\ndreamt exactly where the money was found. He had so little belief in\nhis dream that he tossed up as to whether he should go to look for the\nmoney again or not.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nMR. ANGELO LEWIS AND DR. MONCK.\nTo t\"e Editor of tile JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL REsEARCH.\nSIa,-ln the last number of the Journal you print a letter from Mr. Angelo\nLewis in which occurs the following passage: \"One of Dr. Monck's stock\nfeats was to place a musical-box on the table, and cover it with a cigar-box,\nafter which it played or stopped playing at command. Suggested explanation,\n, Spirits.' Real explanation, that the box ill question did nothing at all, the\nBOund being produced by a second box strapped to Monck's leg above the\nknee (inside the trouser), and set in motion by pressure against the under\nsurface of the table.\"\nNow, as you refuse to accept any evidence of spiritual phenomena on\nvague hearsay, I think you should equally refuse to accept or print such vague\naccusations as this. Does Mr. Lewis mean by \"real explanation\" that he\nhimself actually discovered a box tied to Dr. Monck's leg in the way described1\nOr, merely, that in his own imitations of the phenomena he uses one\nBO tied 1 If the latter, I submit that he bad no right whatever to use the\nterm \"real explanation,\" or to treat Dr. Monck as an impostor in this\nmatter. I happen to have witnessed the phenomena myself, and I can\ndeclare positively that Mr. Lewis' ReCount of it is incorrect. The following is\nan extract from my notes made at the time: \"September 21st, 1877. seance\nat Mr. C. Reimers', 6, Manor-villas, Richmond. Present-Dr. Monck, Mr.\nand Mrs. Bennett, Dr. Malcolm, Mrs. Firman and sister, Mr. Reimers, Mr.\nA. R.

It\nthen played and stopped when requested, and this took place when I placed\nmy hand lightly on it.

WALLACE.\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nDEAR SIR,-In reply to Mr. Wallace's letter, my informant as to the\nmusical-box matter was Mr. H. B. Lodge, of Huddersfield., the gentleman\nwho was the instrument of the crushing exposure of MOllck, in October,\n1876. Not caring to rest entirely on my own recollection of facts which took\nplace 13 years ago, I have submitted Mr. Wallace's letter to Mr. Lodge, who\nreplies as follows :-\n\"Your statement as to Dr. Monck's musical-box trick is quite correct.\nI put the .cigar-box over the working part of the mnsical-box with my own\nhands, and Monck did not get a sound from it till this was done, and even\nthen only in a very dim light. At first I was puzzled j then it struck me\nhow it was done, and I was so certain about it that at the end of the seance\nI offered the doctor a handsome sum (whether \u00a320 or \u00a350 I cannot now be\ncertain, but I think the latter) if he would allow me to search him and I did\nnot find both a duplicate musical-box and a 'spirit hand' we had seen in the\ncourse of the manifestations. I further told him that if I failed to do so I\nwould not only make him the most abject apology, but would become a\nSpiritualist and work for the cause to the very utmost of my power. All the\nsitters except myself and one other gentleman were Spiritualists, and they\nagreed that my offer was a fair one. In fact, his host (Mr. Hepplestolle)\nsaid to the doctor, 'If you have nothing concealed, why not allow Mr. Lodge\nto see for himself 1 We are believers, and we also believe Mr. Lodge to be\nan honest investigator,' or something to that effect. The other Spiritualists\npresent also urged Monck to consent, but instead of doing so, he struck me\nin the face, and then rushed up to .his bedroom and locked himself in. After\nsome time a policeman was fetched, and the uoor burst in j and if it had not\nbeen for an open window and a couple of sheets tied to the waterspout, I\nhave no doubt some of us would have thought the doctor had been' spirited'\naway. The Rev. Dr. Monck had certainly 'Hown,' and without either hat\nor overcoat. No doubt he took many things with him. A small box (about\n10 or 12 inches by six), which he had brought into the seance with him was\nmiBSing, and the' hand' and duplicate musical-box used a.t the s4lance would\nnaturally be on his person j but he left plenty of other evidence behind, for\nin two lock-up boxes and a large-sized bath (locked and strapped) we found\nscores of things such as 'spirit hands,' 'spirit faces,' , Hoating rods,' , illumin-\nated names,' 'spirit lamps,' and any quantity of white gauze, in fact, all\nsorts of things to produce so-called 'mallifestations.' We also found some\n60 or 80 keys, some of them being skeleton keys.\n\"The drum in the musical-box which was supposed to play never mOf)ed, or\nDigitized by Google\n\fOct., 1889.] Journal of Society for P8ychical Research. 145\nif it did, the spirits must have moved it back again to the point from which\nit started.\n\" We made every endeavour to trace the small box which Monck had\ncarried off with him when he escaped out of.the window, but without effect.\nWhen he was admitted to bail, I went to the railway statioll and saw him\noff. He waved his hand by way of 'good-bye,' and when the train had got\nperhaps 30 or 40 yards out, he held this very box out of the window,\nshook it, and laughed, as much as to say, 'I have done you here, at all\nevents.'''\nThe sequel will he in the recollection of most of your readers, or may be\nfound recorded in the local newspapers. The matter was taken up by the\nHuddersfield Superintendent of Police, Mr. Hilton, and after one or two\nappearances before the magistrates, Dr. Monck was sentenced (with the\nhearty approval of the local Spiritualists) to three months' imprisonment as\na rogue and a vagabond.\nSo stands the evidence as to the musical-box matter. It is only circum-\nstantial, it is true, but amply sufficient, I think, to satisfy auy unprejudiced\nperson. The charge was clear and precise. A definite assertion was made\nthat this\" manifestation\" was produced by means of a duplicate musical-box\non the person of the medium, and he was challenged to disprove it by\nsubmitting to a search. If he was innocent, he had everything to gain and\nnothing to lose by doing so. He would not only have pocketed a handsome\nmoney 8olatium, but increased his own prestige, and poured shame and\nconfusion upon the head of his accuser. He was surrounded by friends and\nbelievers, only too eager that he should justify himself, and pressing him to\ncomply. Can any sane person doubt that if he could, he would have done\n801 Instead of this, he fiies panic-stricken, leaving behind him damning\nevidence of habitual imposture, in the shape of a whole arsenal o.f fraudulent\nmachinery.\nMr. Wallace argues that my explanation is incorrect, because nearly a\nyear later he was present at a ~llce with MOllCk where an uncovered\nmusical-box movement played and stopped at command, and Mr. Wallace\nadds: co Each person in succession placed his hands 011 the box, and felt it\nplay or stop when desired, thus p1\"O'IJi1'1J that it was not another box under the\neahle which played.\"\nIs this remarkable 1 The wonder would rather have been if Monck, after\nthe undesirable publicity given to that second box up the leg of his trousers,\nhad not amended his modus operandi. He must have ~adly wasted those\nthree months of inforced seclusion, if he did not come fortI1 with a few new\ndevices for the confusion of the unwary, and probably an improved musical-\nbox trick was among them. Mr. Walmce's own note shows that he knew all\naboutthesuggested box under the table, and was!prepared for that contrivance;\nbut probably he was taken in by some device equally simple. \"Each person\nin succession placed his hands on the box, and felt it play or stop when\ndesired.\" Why felt f Obviously because there was not light enough to 866 it\nplay or stop. Does any man ever put out his hand to.feel whether a thing is\nin motion, when his eyes assure him that it is so 7 It is therefore a mere\nDigitized by Google\n\f146 Journal of Society for Psychical Re8earch.

With a\nfar less degree of obscurity than is here indicated, a black silk thread is\nperfectly invisible, and the use of such a thread would be amply sufficient (to\nanyone having the most elementary knowledge of conjuring expedieuts) to\naccount for the playing and stopping of the actuRI box on the table.\nThe only real marvel ill the facts stated is that a gentleman of the\nscientific eminence of Mr. A. R. Wallace Mhould, after the overwhelming\nexposure of October, 1876, again be found sitting with a proved humbug\nlike Monck. The fact illustrates the weakest point of the Spiritualist creed:\nviz., the willingness of believers not merely to hush up proved fraud, but again\nto give credence to the quasi-supernatural powers of thl' imposter. There is\nhardly a medium known to fame who has not been detected in flagrant\ntrickery, but the most scathing exposure does not shake the firm faith of\nthorough-going Spiritualists. However grossly the offender may have\ndeceived others, so long as they themselves have not detected him in fraud\n(as they probably would not till the end of time), they still fraternise\nwith him, \"sit\" with him, take grave notes of his\" manifestations.\" What\nwonder, then, that less credulous persons are chary of accepting their evidence !\nANGELO LEWIS (\" Professor Hoffmann \").\nMULTIPLEX PERSONALITY.\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RF.SEARCH.\nSIa,-It would seem from the discussion which has broken out on this\nsubject that Mr. Myers will at length be compelled to formulate more\nprecisely the ulterior theories that underlie much of his writing, and which\nhe has, in my opinion wisely, not needlessly obtruded hitherto.\nThe question that has been raised may be broadfy stated as beiog:\nWhat must be the inner constitution of the self so as to include the phenomena\nof multiplex personality, and in what sellBe can we speak of \"secondary\nselvell\" 1 And the interpretations of the phenomena thus classified would\nnaturally fall under two heads.\nI. The first kind of interpretation, which Mr. Myers and Mr. Barkworth\nagree in calling the matrialistic, would seek to explain the facts of\n\" multiplex personality\" as co-ordinate effects of peculiar physical conditions,\nneither related to one another, nor correlated manifestations of auy higher\nmotive force. The different personalities on this theory would simply be\ndifferent p6r801ll, that happened to share in, or, more accurately, to be the\nresults of different conditions of, the same body and this fact would serve to\nexplain also their general similarity. The bond of union between the\ndifferent personalities would, in other words, be purely material. In terlllB\nof Mr. Myers' metaphor of the factory, the looms would on this hypothesis\nsupply their own motive forces, form their own connections, and thelllBelves\nchange their modes of linking. The\" selves,\" therefore, i.e., the modes of\ncoupling the looms, are only related in their material, i.e., as modes of\nlinking the same looms, and to speak of \"secondary selves\" is decidedly\nDigitized by Google\n\f<>ct.,1889.] Journal 0\/ Society \/01' Psychical Research. 147\nmisleading, as suggesting some sort of subordination to a primary which has\nitself to be explained as the resultant of a common arrangement of certain\nparticles. It is perhaps necessary to add that this materialistic interpre-\ntation must aim at definitely localising the cerebral centres corresponding to\nevery\" personality,\" and would be greatly facilitated if the pheuomena of\nmultiplex personality can be, as Mr. Barkworth desires, reduced to minor\nvarieties of \"duplex personality,\" and brought into connection with the\nduality of the brain.\nBut it is becoming more and more doubtful whether so summary an\ninterpretation is capable of doing justice to the intricacy of the facts, and\nwhether the limited areas of our cerebral hemispheres can find room for all\nthese different chains of memory and sets of personalities. For, on a materi-\nalist hypothesis, any memory must mean a certain definite arrangement of\nphysical atoms, a change in the relative positions of which would involve loss\nof memory. It is impossible therefore to admit the assumpti. ,n that our\nbrains can contain an infinite or indefinite number of such memories, or\nsystems of particles independently preserving themselves intact and\nincreasing by the addition of other particles. Yet there seem to be an\nindefinite number of \"secondary selves,\" and indefinite potentialities of\nmultiplex personality inherent in each of us, and our present methods seem\nnot to have exhausted their numbers so much as to have limited their\navailable paths of externalisation. If, e.g., we put a pen into the right hand\nof an automatic writer, we get one secondary self manifested concurrently\nwith its primary; if we put another pen into his left hand, we get another\nand it almost seems as if it merely required an automatist capable of writing\nwith his feet to get two more of these\" secondary selves.\" Or, again, on the\nmaterialistic interpretation, what are we to make of the strange glimpses\nafforded us that nothing is ever forgotten, and that the atomic combinations\nthat had passed out of conscious memory had not really been dissolved, but\npersisted unimpaired in some mysterious corner of the brain 7 Hitherto\nmaterialism might have seemed to derive support from the phenomena. of\nmemory, and have seemed able to explain oblivion by the necessity of\ndissolving the combinations of particles constituting memory in order to\nmake room for more recent impl\u00b7essions in the limited area of the brain, but\nnow the brain appears to be an intelligent phonograph of inconceivable\ndelicacy that has stored up in its records far more than ever entered into the\nconscious life of its owner.\nII. These and similar difficulties seem to impel a candid investigator\ntowards the second interpretation of the phenomena by means of an under-\nlying non-material principle, that would represent the bond of union of the\nmultiplex personalities, and stand towards the physical organism in the\nrelation rather of a cause than of an effect. For not the least important\npoint about hypnotic experiments is the weird power which the\" unconscious\nself\" seems to possess over the bodily organism. When a hypnotic suggestion\ncan destroy something so physical as the pain of organic disease, or produce\nstructural changes, to say nothing of the as yet doubtful powers of lucidity\nand clairvoyant prescience, we seem by its aid to have influenced the\nprinciple which actually build8 wp the bod!! and regulates the growth of the\nDigitized by Google\n\f148 Journal of Society f01' Psychical Research. [Oct., 1889.\norganism. And at the sam!! time this principle that sways the body.\napparently at will, and is able to make matter, seems like the long.sought\nscientific illustration of idealist philosophic theories that declare spirit alone\nto be the ultimate reality. And though it is, of course, still possible to\ntake divergent views of this ground and unity of the manifold psychical\nactivities within us, I hope I shall not tie myself down to anything mis-\nchievously precise if I venture to offer some criticisms of the phraseology to\nwhich Mr. Myers seems inclined to give the weighty sanction of his authority.\nThe term \"individuality\" ought surely to mean the property of being an\n\" individual,\" i.e., something possessed by every stOlle and every atom of a\nstone as well as by conscious beings, and hence something less and not more\nthan\" personality.\" Though, tht'refore, it might improperly be used, instead\nof the more precise term\" body,\" to designate the relations of the multiplex\npersonalities on the materialistic hypothesis, it would bt' decidedly misleading\nto mean thereby such a higher alld deeper principle of union as we seem\nlikely to require. I would suggest rather the adoption of a term about\nwhich the metaphysicians have dreamt much, and which psychical research\nnow seems to bring for the first time into the purview of exact science. If\nwe call this underlying unity the Tramcendental Ego, we shall, I think, acquire\nan unobjectionable term to express the most striking characteristics of the\nphenomeua ill question. It \"\"ell expresst's both its transcendence of the\nlimitatiolls of our ordinary cOllsciousness and also the connection aud funda-\nmental kinship with it which it possesses in virtue of its individual selfhood.\nWe should thus be able to distinguish precisely, firstly, the phenomenal selfor\nnormal consciousness; secondly, the \"8econdaf'!\/ 8elve8\"; and thirdly, their\nuniou and harmony in the Tran8cendental E,qo, the realisation of which in a\nfully developed consciousness might be represented as the ideal or aim of the\nevolution of the other two. I have already occupied too much of your\npatience to touch upon the metaphysical superstructure that might be\nerected upon this basis, but it will be evident that Mr. Barkworth's fears as\nto the effect of modern researches into \"multiplex personality\" upon our\nprospects of immortality are justly declared by Mr. Myers to be entirely\ngroundless. For if our normal self is but one ont of many imperfect and\npartial manife_tatiolls of a transcendent personality, we Ileed no longer\nfear that our true self possesses an amount of reality varying with the\nchances of this mortal life; that it is crushed by disease, curtailed by loss of\nmemory, subverted by insanity, suspended by sleep, and finally dissolved by\ndeath: on the contrary,the grave difficulties that any rational eschatology must\nas yet continue to present may, perhaps, here receive an ultimate solution.\nC. ScHILLER.\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL REsEARCH.\nSIR,-In the Journal for May last Mr. Barkworth invited me to set forth\nsome of the accumulating evidence which makes (as I hold) for the conception\nof Multiplex Personality. I have thought that this could be best done in the\ncourse of notices of certain French books and pamphlets of which it was\nthought desirable that reviews should appear ill the forthcoming Part XV. of\nour Proceeding8. To those reviews, therefore, I beg to refer Mr. Barkworth\nDigitized by Google\n\fOct.. 1889.] Journal of Society for P8ychical }lp,llearch. 149\nTurning to Mr. Schilll'r's letter, with which I am in substantial agreement,\nI understand hill objection to be to the use of the word individualityas meaning\na unity pervading or expressed by an indefinite number of minor individu-\nalities. If one wisbes to imply that this larger unity antecedes and underlies\nwhatsoever masks or \"._ it. may lUl8ume in this or ot.her existences, the\nterm Transcendental Self or Tranll\".endental Ego is more directly expressive.\nBut have we a right to borrow terms which seem to transcend experience for\nour use in Experimental Psychology 1 Should we not rather seek our\nanalogy from the natural history of animals otht-r than ourselves 1\nYet much the same difficulty as ours seems to be already felt by naturalists\nin describing what would he our truest parallel ;-namely, those inferior\nanimal forms which consist of a co-operating aggregate of millor individuals.\nTo call a hydrozoon a \"colonial aniDlal\" sounds rather as though we could\nnot conceive of any organised community except in Queen~land or Canada.\nWe ought, perhaps, to adopt the term in psychology, and to speak of our-\nselves as \"colonial 8Oul8.\" Yet I fear that we should thus be exposed to\nmisapprehensiouslike that of the gentleman who, seeing \"Colonial Animals\"\n8{h'ertised as the subject of a discourse, offered the lecturer the loan of a\nkangaroo.\nFREDERIC W.

WOOD.\n4, The Avenue, Colchester.\nJune 16th.\n[The calle forwarded by Mrs. Wood is printed in the present number of\nthe Joui\u00b7nal, p. 139, and is numbered G. 4.-ED.]\nTo tke Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nSIR,-Among the suggestions in the June issue of our Journal, as to the\nreason of the action of the dogs accompanying General Barter, at the time\nof the apparition in India, I do not find auy similar to a.n impression I had\non first reading the account and which may be worth discussion or considera-\ntion, viz., that the terror of the animals was derived from that of their\nmaster; impressed telepathically and shared by them as a tranaferred idea\nonly, not in their case the result of, or accompanied by, any\" pictorial basis,\"\n-- phantasmal or hallucinatory.\nAs these animals have often been known to seemingly act in anticipation\nof t,he wishes of their masters, before utterance, command, or even gesture\nftom the latter; and are noted for intelligence in such capacity, I do not\u00b7\nthink it should be considered extravagant to assume that strong mental\nexcitation allied to fear on the part of the General, was reflected, as\n\" undefined\" terror, in the perception of the dogs, instead of arising in\nthem as a result of any direct 86naory impreB81:on, either visua.l or auditory-\nand thus purely as a transmitted mental\" percept \"-quite unconnected with\nany \"sight of the alarm depicted on their master's countenance,\" as\nsuggested by Dr. Klein. With regard to Mrs. Sidgwick's hypothesis I\ncallnot conceive that a mere confused sound of shifting gravel could have\nbeen so rhythmical in its nature, as to cause the dogs by a process, as it were,\nof mental induction, in themselves to postulate the sounel of a horse galloping\nand thence anticipate (\" ex pede Herculem\") the necessary sequence of a\nvisible pony to such a degree as absolutely to become so terrified thereat as to\nrun away in consequence of the said pOlly'S non\u00b7appearance.\n* It will be remembered that General Barter heard sounds as of an approaching\nhorse, and saw an apparition of a man on a pony and two grooms. His dogs.\nexhibited signs of alarm. The case is published in Proceeding8 XIV., p. 469.\nDigitized by Google\n\fOct.,1889.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 151\nShould my idea of the possibility of receptivity in animals for telepathic\nimpressions from human beings be true, the same may exist also between\nammals of the lower orderll, and would also apply to hundreds of recorded\ncases of the behaviour of dogs, in face of supranormal occurrences.\nH. VENJIIAN.\nJune 15th, 1889.\nINTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF PHYSIOLOGICAL\nPSYCHOLOGY.\nThe meeting of this Congress, which was annollnced in previous Journals,\ntook place at Paris in August, and was considered to be a decided success.\nThe Congress took up the statistical inquiry into the frequency and nature\nof hallucinations which we bad already begun, and this inquiry will be carried\non in various countries of Europe, and in the United States of America. We\nhope that an interesting report on the subject will be presented to the\nCongress at their next meeting, (which is to be in London ill 1892,) and if\nwe are right in our belief in the telepathic origin of many hallucinations, it\ncannot but lead to a considerable addition to our knowledge of this, and,\nperhapsofother psychicalsubjects, as well as to a wider acceptance of our views,\nand interest in our researches. Though telepathy did not form one of the\nmain subjects of discussion by the Congress, we were struck with the amount\nof interest that seemed to be taken in the subject, even by persons who do\nnot yet consider it to be an established fact.\nWe do not give any report of the Congress here, as one will appear in a\nfew weeks in our Proceedings, Part XV.\nTHE USE OF HYPNOTIC TREATMENT IN INSANITY.\nAt the meeting of the British Medical Association, which was heldat Leeds\nlast August, a remarkable paper was read by M. Auguste Voisin, physician to\nthe Salplltriilre Hosp-ital, Paris, on the treatment of cases of insanity and of\nbackward and imbectle children by hypnotism. Such an attempt had not been\nseriously made till within the last few years, but some very good results had\nbeen reached ill Paris by patient treatment. It had been used on some cases\nof insanity with hallucination and delusion, with success and also on some\nvery serious cases of suicidal and acute mania. In some cases in which there\nwel'e recurrent attacks of acute mania, it had been found possible to keep the\npatients asleep for as much as six or eight days, and thus to tide over the times\nof crisis, and induce recovery. Some chronic cases of dipsomania and\nmorphinomania had als(> been cured. Several English doctors expressed\ntheir surprise; but Dr. Langdon Down had seen some similar good effects\nof hypnotic control; and Dr. Lloyd Tuckey had found hypnotism very useful\nin some cases of dipsomania, and also drew the attention of the Association\nto the records of the Rev. Arthur Tooth, of Woodside, Croydon, who had\nestablished a most successful institute for inebriates and others of bad habits,\nill which hypnotism had been of use in 79 per cent of the cases. Dr. Percy\nSmith related the use of hypnotic treatment by Mr. G. A. Smith, with the\nassistance of Dr. A. T. Myers, at Bethlehem Royal Hospital, on 16 patients,\nwhere not much success had been as yet attained, but further trial would be\nmade; and Dr. Hack Tuke mentioned that he had suggested such an attempt\nas far back as 1865, and was very glad to hear of M. Auguste Voisin's success.\nHe hoped that soon there might be more results to show for it in England.\nDigitized by Google\n\f152 JO'U1\"Tlal of Society for Psychical Resea1'ch.
