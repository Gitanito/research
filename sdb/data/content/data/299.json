His experimental research focuses on remote viewing, which he has used to make significant discoveries in the field of archaeology. Schwartz is especially concerned with the means of creating social transformation and is founder and editor of the Schwartz Report, a website containing fact-based articles on environmental, social and political matters.

Schwartz credits their lack of interest in religion and strong commitment to medical science, especially consciousness, for giving him \u2018an open-minded sense of consciousness as a thing unto itself\u2019.1\n\nAs a twelve-year-old he was sometimes allowed to observe surgeries inside the operating room. On one occasion an emergency arose during an operation on a teenage girl; on regaining consciousness she told Schwartz\u2019s father that she had risen above her body and then, finding no one would listen to her, went to the nurses\u2019 station where she observed a doctor flirting with one of the nurses. She also said she crossed the city to observe her grandmother.2&nbsp; Her descriptions were found to be correct in numerous details. Schwartz heard his father relate this account to medical colleagues, many of whom responded with similar stories.\n\nSchwartz had another apparently-paranormal experience when, having served a tour in the US Army as a conscript, he was visiting Williamsburg, Virginia, where his mother\u2019s family had lived since the 1600s. Walking in a colonial-era street at night he encountered a man dressed in period costume, who entered a house by walking through the closed front door. A local historian traced the address to an ancestor of Schwartz, whose portrait he recognized as the ghost.\n\nAged 24, Schwartz experienced a spiritual crisis which led him to realize that so far he had lived by shallow values, and lacked a meaningful inner life. At this time he was introduced to the work of the healing psychic Edgar Cayce and reviewed some of Cayce\u2019s readings on a visit to the Association of Research and Enlightenment (ARE) in Virginia Beach. Many of these impressed him, in particular one which contained ancient information that was unknown to historians at the time of the reading but that was verified eleven years later through the discovery of the Dead Sea scrolls.\n\nSchwartz remained at ARE for five years, studying the Cayce readings and the major texts of all religious faiths, also the works of Rudolf Steiner, Helena Blavatsky, Alice Bailey and other spiritual thought leaders. He was interested in the experiences in what he terms the \u2018nonlocal\u2019 consciousness of each tradition\u2019s founder. He familiarized himself with parapsychology, particularly the work of JB Rhine and Ian Stevenson. He was impressed by the archival diligence of Cayce\u2019s lifelong secretary Gladys Davis, an influence he carried into his own work.\n\nSchwartz attended two healings by the Shoshone shaman Rolling Thunder, watching as he appeared to draw out the misty form of a wolf from an injured boy, whose wound healed immediately. Rolling Thunder\u2019s work especially convinced Schwartz that his way forward was experimental, paving the way to his parapsychological achievements. He writes, \u2018I began comparing the findings of modern science with what I already understood to be empirically developed sciences like shamanism and the enduring spiritual traditions; all of which recognize, when you strip away the dogma, that consciousness is the fundamental\u2019.3 &nbsp;\n\nIn 1971, Schwartz began working for the American government, writing speeches for President Richard Nixon, Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger, and US Navy commanders.4 He was one of a small group that transformed the American armed forces from \u2018a racist, elitist, gender discriminating conscription force into an all-volunteer meritocracy\u2019.5 Disillusioned by the Watergate scandal, he left to pursue a career in consciousness research and dissemination to the public, which he continues to this day.\n\nSchwartz has received the Parapsychological Association\u2019s \u2018Outstanding Contribution Award\u2019 for 2017.6 For other honours, see \u2018Awards\u2019 below.\n\nStephan Schwartz married his first wife, Hayden Oliver Gates in 1981, and was widowed in 2001. His second and current wife is Ronlyn Arnatt. He has a daughter, Katherine Rowland Schwartz, and a step-daughter, Lea Meyers.  Early Experimental Work\n\nIn Schwartz\u2019s first experiments with remote viewing, or \u2018distant viewing\u2019 as he termed it then, he laid out a 12x12 foot square grid in his backyard, buried an object and persuaded volunteers to try to psychically determine which of the 144 squares held the object and what it was. Results were statistically significant in both respects. This was the start of the remote viewing protocol he continues to use.\n\nIn the early 1970s, some parapsychologists argued that psi might be an electromagnetic phenomenon. This was largely disproved by the Soviet parapsychologist Leonard Vasiliev, who established experimentally that psychics could obtain veridical information while shielded in Faraday cages and deep caves, which blocked electromagnetic transmission. Schwartz reasoned that if psi worked electromagnetically it must be at extremely low frequencies (ELF) of 300 Hz or less, which he knew from his naval experience could penetrate deep below the surface of the ocean. Denied the use of a submarine, Schwartz put this inquiry on hold, but was encouraged to discover, by reading a 1974 paper by Russell Targ and Hal Puthoff about remote viewing research at the Stanford Research Institute7 that others were thinking along the same lines. &nbsp;\n\nSchwartz turned to studying oracular and shamanic rituals, which involve what he terms \u2018a state of intentioned consciousness\u2019, to try to find the optimal conditions for a person to have an experience of nonlocal consciousness. He realized that archaeology would be an ideal testing-ground for remote viewing because it involved truly blind targets.\n\nHe started by researching whether anyone had tried psychic archaeology previously, compiling his results in a 1978 book, The Secret Vaults of Time. It covers previous twentieth-century digs that had been aided by insights gained psychically, some by the Canadian George McMullen, with whom Schwartz himself would eventually work.\n\nIn 1976, Schwartz collaborated with an archaeologist to try to trace an idol and archaeological sites in Mexico. Schwartz reports that the remote viewing aspect worked but the fieldwork, which he did not direct, was incomplete and gave poor feedback.8\n\nLater that year, Schwartz was given access to a research submersible, which he used to undertake his \u2018Project Deep Quest\u2019 in collaboration with psychics Ingo Swann and Hella Hammid. In a filmed experiment, each was given a chart of 1,500 square miles of ocean to scan by remote viewing; both independently located a shipwreck and artifacts that would be found near it, in the same spot, and accurately. Swann and Hammid succeeded in remote viewing target scenes on land from the submersible, at a depth that made ELF transmission highly unlikely. Both tests disproved the theory that psi is an electromagnetic phenomenon.9 \u2018Deep Quest\u2019, Schwartz writes, \u2018set the pattern for the archaeological research I would do over the next two decades\u2019.  The Alexandria Project\n\nSchwartz\u2019s next project is his best known: psychic archaeology tests in the Egyptian city of Alexandria, which he chose for its importance to the intellectual heritage of the West.10 He secured funding and began assembling a research team in the fall of 1978. To try to enhance the accuracy of the remote viewing, he used fifteen psychics, both experienced and beginners, to obtain consensus findings. Each was given a map and asked to look for the lost tomb of the ancient conqueror Alexander the Great and the remains of the Library of Alexandria, the ancient world\u2019s leading bibliographic collection, which had been destroyed by Christians in the early Christian era.\n\nThree common areas were pinpointed by the viewers, including one linked in city folklore to Alexander\u2019s resting place, the Nebi Daniel mosque in central Alexandria. Several psychics also said they sensed something significant in the waters of the city\u2019s East Harbour.\n\nSchwartz chose Hella Hammid and George McMullen to travel to Alexandria for onsite viewing. They pinpointed and explored several important sites, discovering many correspondences between their intuitions and known histories. Both were drawn to the Nebi Daniel mosque; McMullen felt certain that Alexander\u2019s tomb, broken up but still identifiable, lay about 25 feet below it, although he also believed no human remains were there. However, an attempted excavation was interrupted for lack of government permissions and remains uncompleted.\n\nGreater success was achieved at Marea, a buried city about 43 kilometres from Alexandria, where McMullen staked out ground under which he had viewed the ruins of a building. Excavation proved both psychics\u2019 viewing correct on many points and more accurate than electronic sensing, which had been tried earlier and found nothing.11\n\nEgyptian officials were impressed by these results and now supported underwater exploration in the East Harbour. Based on information provided by psychics, Schwartz and his dive crew found statues and ruins of major importance, including palaces built by Mark Antony and Cleopatra and the remains of a massive building that appeared to have been the ancient lighthouse of Pharos. Schwartz published these findings,12 but the project was at first sensationalized and then attacked by the media through quotes from sceptics. It was ignored by the academic community, which refused to publish Schwartz\u2019s papers. In the mid-1990s, a French-Egyptian archaeological team claimed credit for discovering the ruins.  Other Archaeological Explorations\n\nSchwartz\u2019s other expeditions of this type include:   \t1984: Lake Erie, location of the wreck of the cargo vessel Dean Richmond \t1985: St. Ann\u2019s Bay in Jamaica, where the remains of Columbus\u2019s last two ships were known to lie (a field survey showed finds only where the psychic team had specified)13 \t1987-88: Grand Bahamas Banks, location of the Brig Leander and 18 other wreck sites14   Other Parapsychological Research\n\nSchwartz, assisted by OMNI Magazine and the newspaper Los Angeles Weekly, performed a large-scale international test of precognition in which tens of thousands of people participated.15 He concluded that people who are \u2018open-minded, tolerant, and creative\u2019 are most successful as psychics.16\n\nAn early informal experiment showed that people tasting two glasses of wine routinely preferred the one on which meditators had focused good intentions rather than the control. Schwartz subsequently obtained significant results in a test of whether healing intention could change the molecular structure of water as measured by infrared spectrophotometry.17\n\nSchwartz\u2019s current research is inspired by the threat posed by climate change. It studies how nonlocal consciousness affects social systems and how individuals and small groups can influence the course of history. He views climate change as a problem soluble only through post-materialist science.18  Schwartz Report\n\nSchwartz is founder and editor of the Schwartz Report website, which he describes as \u2018an entirely fact-based daily publication in favor of the earth, the inter-connectedness and interdependence of all life, democracy, equality for all, liberty, and things that are life-affirming\u2019, offering regular articles to \u2018warn readers about actions, events, and trends that threaten those values\u2019. He writes: \u2018Our country now stands at a crossroads; indeed, the world stands at a crossroads where those values are very much at risk and it is up to each of us who care about wellbeing to do what we can to defend those principles.\u2019  Awards   \tCertificate of Commendation, Department of the Navy 1973 \t2016 Nautilus Book Award for Social Change for The 8 Laws of Change \tRecipient of the 2017 Parapsychological Association Outstanding Contribution Award \tOOOM Magazine (Germany), named one of \u2018The 100 Most Inspiring People in the World,\u2019 2018 \tAlbert Nelson Marquis Award for Outstanding Contributions, 2018 \tBook Excellence Award for Literary Excellence, 2018, for the novel Awakening   Academic and Research Appointments   \tBIAL Funda\u00e7ao (BIAL Foundation) Fellow (2006-2010, 2019-present) \tFellow of the William James Center for Consciousness Studies, Sofia University (2018) \tDistinguished Consulting Faculty, Saybrook University (2014 to present) \tSenior Samueli Fellow for Brain, Mind and Healing, Samueli Institute.
