The methods\nof interpretation that we apply to them are similar to\nthose generally applied to works of literature ;\nexamples.\nThe obscurities in the scripts are clue partly to their\nalhisiveness and conciseness, and partly, it is suggested,\nto the \" author's \" wish to conceal his meaning from\nthe \" writers,\" in order to prevent the action of tele-\npathy between them, till his experiment is complete,\nA\n\f2 Alice Johnson. [part\nRecent study has shown the meaning of much that\nPAGE\nwas obscure in some already published scripts, and\nsome of the results, with a number of scripts hitherto\nunpublished, are given in the present paper.\nChapter I. Cross-correspondence : \" Ave Roma Im-\nmortalis \" - .... 11\nMrs. Verrall's scripts relating to this topic were first\ninterpreted as alluding to Raphael's picture of St. Leo's\nmeeting with Attila. It now appears that they allude\nalso to the Columns of Trajan and Marcus Aurelius,\na detail in the former of which was copied in Raphael's\npicture. Mrs. Verrall's scripts give a bird's-eye view\nof the history of Rome, to which Mrs. Holland's corre-\nsponding script appropriately applies.\nChapter II. The Theory of Cross-correspondences and\nthe Latin Message ... - 24\nSummary of the Latin Message Experiment, showing\nits place in the order of events and of cross-correspon-\ndences.\nChapter III. Cross-correspondence : \" Hope, Star,\nand Browning \" - ... - 28\nMrs. Holland's contributions, hitherto unpublished, to\nthis case. References in her script to Professor Mait-\nland. Tabular summary.\nChapter IV. Cross-correspondence : \" Alexander's\nTomb \" - - - 50\nDiscovery that this phrase in Miss Verrall's script re-\nferred to Alexander de' Medici, who was buried in one\nof the two Medici tombs at Florence ; and that other\nallusions to the Medici occur in other scripts, especially\nthrough the Laurel, which was the emblem of Lorenzo\nthe Magnificent.

Mrs. Holland's\nscripts ; her references to Leah and Rachel and Moses\ninterpreted as alluding to the tomb of Julius II, in the\nsame church. Euripidean references in Mrs. Piper's\nand Mrs. Holland's scripts. Chronological summary.\nChapter VII. Some General Conclusions - 143\nThe scripts are a composite product, the knowledge\nand mental activities of the \" writers \" being moulded\nunder the guidance of a supervising intelligence,\u2014the\n\" author.\" Examples of cases, showing in a graduated\nscale the apparent influence of the \" author \" as a\nmore and more important factor : (1) \"The One-Horse\nDawn \" ; the \" author \" faintly indicated through\nthe rational use made of a fact completely forgotten\nby the experimenter. (2)\n\" Ave Roma immortalis ;\nthe fresh points brought forward in this paper show hi\nthe combination of the scripts of the two writers more\nintelligent mental action and reasoning than can easily\nbe attributed to either writer alone. (3) The \" Sevens\n\"\n\f4 Alice Johnson. [part\nCase ; the compounding of two separate topics in the\nscripts of six writers suggests the influence of a single\n\" author \" on all of them. In order to avoid the in-\nfluence of living experimenters or of writers on the\nscripts, it is necessary for the \" author \" to conceal his\ndesign from them till his own experiment is complete.\nOne device is to allude to some specific but unfamiliar\nfeature of a familiar object, so that they do not recognise\nthe allusion. Examples : the allusions to the Columns\nof Trajan and Marcus Aurelius ; to the tomb of Julius\nII., and to the Medici tombs. But the \" author \" must\nultimately reveal his design,\n\u2014\ne.g. by showing through\nthe script of one writer unsuspected connections between\nthe scripts of two other writers. Example :\n\" Alex-\nander's Tomb.\" Evidence afforded in this case by\nthe writers' misinterpretation of their own scripts that\nthe \" author \" had apparently succeeded in concealing\nhis design from them. The connection between the\nscripts of two writers given hi 1907 in a third writer's\nscript was, in fact, not recognised till 1912, when it\nwas observed that the \" author \" had revealed it in\n1910 through the script of a fourth writer. Continued\nstudy makes it more and more difficult to explain the\nmass of cross-correspondences as due to the unaided\nsubliminal powers of the writers.\nList of Illustrations - 156\nINTRODUCTION.\nThe increasing complexity of commentaries on the automatic\nscripts of Mrs. Verrall, Mrs. Holland, Mrs. Piper, and others,\nas well as some recent criticisms, suggests the desirability of\na few preliminary remarks on the nature of the phenomena\ndealt with.\nIt has to be borne in mind that they differ in several ways\nfrom typical experiments in telepathy between living per-\nsons. In the latter case, each experiment can be counted\nas successful, partially successful, or a complete failure. If,\n\flxviii.] Some \" Concordant Automatisms.\" 5\ntherefore, the experiments are limited to a specified set of\nobjects to be guessed, such as a pack of playing-cards, it\nis possible to state precisely whether the success is more\nthan would probably be obtained by chance, and if so, how\nmuch more. Even if the experiments are not thus limited,\nit is still possible to say how many of them have been suc-\ncessful, though in that case we can only judge by general\nconsiderations of common-sense whether the amount of success\nis more than could reasonably be attributed to chance.\nThe coincidences between the scripts of different auto-\nmatists cannot be estimated as such experiments can, because\nthere is no way of deciding what should be regarded as the\necpiivalent of an experiment : we cannot say that so many\nexperiments, or what is ecpaivalent to so many, have been\ntried. Further, the coincidences obviously vary so much\nin importance that their mere number can have no significance,\nwhile the scripts also vary greatly in length and as to the\nnumber of topics contained in each.\nFrom these causes alone no mathematical estimate of the\namount of coincidence as compared with the amount that\nmight have been obtained by chance is, or can ever be,\npossible in the case of the scripts. And this is one reason\nwhy the inferences to be drawn from them cannot be stated\nin a brief and explicit form.\nBut there is a still more fundamental difference between\nexperiments in telepathy and correspondences between scripts.\nA typical series of experiments is composed of isolated units,\nlike throws of dice, when each throw is a separate matter,\ncomplete in itself and exercising no influence whatever on\nany of the other throws. On the other hand, a script repre-\nsents an emergence of ideas from the automatist's subliminal\nconsciousness, so that it is potentially, if not actually, con-\ntinuous with all the other scripts of the same automatist.\nTherefore, if a script is treated by itself as an isolated unit, most\nof its significance will probably be missed ;\njust as the words\nand actions of a hypnotised person might be completely\nmisunderstood by persons who were ignorant of the events\nof his previous hypnotic states.\nThe scripts have therefore to be analysed very carefully ;\nall the allusions made to any topic at different times should\n\f6 Alice Johnson. [part\nbe compared together ; and when this is done, it often\nhappens that a passage that has seemed vague and meaningless\nbecomes clear and significant through the light thrown on\nit by other scripts.\n\" Search the scriptures and the dust shall be converted\ninto fine gold,\" as the Mac script observed 1\nin connection\nwith references to Sesame and Lilies, obviously meaning\nthat the same sort of careful verbal study should be applied\nto the scripts that Ruskin applied to a portion of Lycidas\nin the lecture Sesame ; and a few instances may be given\nto show that the usual way of treating literary problems is\nactually very much like our way of treating the scripts.\nThe three following quotations from Dante illustrate the\nfact that passages, which, when isolated, appear vague or\nmeaningless, may throw light on one another and become\nclear when put together :\n(1)\n\" The next who followeth [in the ejebrow of the eagle], . . .\nto give place to the \u00a3>astor, made himself a Greek \" (Par. XX. 55).\n(2)\n\" Then ... I saw the eagle descend down into the body\nof the car [i.e. the Church], and leave it feathered with his\nplumage \" {Purg. XXXII. 124).\n(3)\n\" Ah, Constantino ! to how much ill gave birth, not thy\nconversion, but that dower which the first rich Father took from\nthee !\n\" (Inf. XIX. 115).\nThese passages are shown to be connected by the same\nkind of internal evidence that leads us to regard certain\nscripts as connected, viz. by their having points in common.\nBetween (1) and (2) are two points in common : the Eagle\n(generally representing in Dante the ideal Roman Empire)\nand the Pastor or the Church. The connection between (1)\nand (3) is also twofold\u2014the \"Pastor\" and the \"Greek\" of\n(1) being equivalent to the \"Father\" and \" Constantine \" of\n(3). Thus (3) throws light on (1) and (2), and, when we consider\nDante's known views on the relation of Church and State,\nit becomes clear that all three passages allude to the tradition\n(believed by him) that Constantine transferred the capital of\nthe Roman Empire to Constantinople out of gratitude to\n1\nSee Proc, Vol. XXIV., p. 307.\n\flxviii.] Some \" Concordant Automatisms.\" 7\nPope Sylvester for curing him of leprosy, and with the object\nof leaving to the Pope and his successors the sovereignty\nover Italy. This explains the allegory in (2), by showing\nthat the feathers shed by the Eagle are equivalent to the\n\"dower\" in (3).\nFrom the point of view of understanding the passages, it\ndoes not, of course, matter that they are historically incor-\nrect ; the only question is what Dante meant ; and it appears\nthat he is expressing in a brief and concise way both the\nsupposed facts and his own condemnation of the action\nwhich\u2014through its giving rise to the temporal power of\nthe Papacy\u2014he believed to be at the root of most of the\nevils of his time.\nSimilarly, it is of no consequence for the purposes of inter-\npretation whether the scripts are historically or linguistically\ncorrect ; the only essential question is, what is the meaning\nintended to be conveyed by the writing ; and this can often\nbe made clear by putting two or more passages together.\nIn the next instance, the recurrence of the same striking\nphrase in two different works by the same author affords\nevidence of a continuity of thought between the two occa-\nsions :\n(1)\n\" But thought's the slave of life, and life time's fool.\"\n(Hotspur's dying sj^eech in King Henry IV., Part I.)\n(2)\n\" Love's not Time's fool, though rosy hps and cheeks\nWithin his bending sickle's compass come.\"\n{Sonnet CXVI.)\nI think it can hardly be doubted that Shakespeare in this\nsecond passage was remembering and alluding to the first,\n1\njust as one script may allude to a much earlier one.\nAgain, the combination of the same words, phrases, or\nideas\u2014none very striking hi itself,\u2014in two widely separated\npassages of the same work is evidence of continuity of thought\n1\nThe date of composition of the Sonnets is supposed to have spread over\na number of years, and, the one quoted being late in the series, it is probable,\nthough not certain, that it was written after King Henry IV. The\ninternal evidence afforded by a comparison of the two quotations makes\nit, I think, almost certain that the second was the later one.\n\f8 Alice Johnson. [part\nbetween the two passages. Thus in Browning's Aristophanes'\nApology, near the beginning, we find :\n\" O'er this world\nExtends that realm where, '\nas the wise assert,'\nPhilemon, thou shalt see Euripides\nClearer than mortal sense perceived the man !\n\"\nAnd after a great deal of intermediate matter, ineluding\nthe translation of a whole play of Euripides, Philemon him-\nself says :\n\" Grant, in good sooth, our great dead, all the same,\nRetain their sense, as certain wise men say,\nI'd hang myself\u2014to see Euripides !\n\"\nHere there is no exact verbal parallelism,-\u2014the nearest\nbeing \" as the wise assert \" and \" as certain wise men say \"\n;\nbut the general similarity both of words and of ideas is so\ngreat that it seems certain that in the second passage Brown-\ning was deliberately referring back to the first.\nOne more instance will illustrate another important point\nin our argument about scripts.\nLamb, in his poem On an infant dying as soon as born,\nwrites :\n\" Shall we say that Nature blind,\nCheck'd her hand, and changed her mind,\nJust when she had exactly wrought\nA finish'd pattern without fault ?\nCould she flag, or could she the,\nOr lack'd she the Promethean fire . . .\nThat should thy little limbs have quicken 'd ?\n\"\nThough the central idea of this passage\u2014the creative Pro-\nmethean fire\u2014is, of course, to be found in many writers, the\nfact that Lamb was especially familiar with Othello makes it,\nto my mind, pretty certain that he was here borrowing from\nOthello's solilocjuy before he killed Desdemona :\n\" Once put out thy light\nThou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature,\nI know not where is that Promethean heat\nThat can thy light relume.\"\n{Othello, Act V., Sc. 2.)\n\flxviii.] Some\n-i\nConcordant Automatisms.\" 9\nThere are, it will be seen, other slight resemblances between\nthe two passages ; but my view that Lamb derived his \" Pro-\nmethean fire \" from this rather than from other sources is\nbased not so much on the resemblances as on what is known of\nhis intimate knowledge of the play.\nSimilarly, we may trace fragmentary phrases in the scripts\nto literary sources with which the automatists are known\nto be familiar. E.g. in Mrs. Holland's script (see below,\npp. 45 and 114) I trace \" the perfect strength \" (March 20, 1907)\nto Rossetti's Blessed Damozel ; and \" a billowy cloud \" (April 8,\n1907) to Browning's Last Ride Together, because both these\npoems are very well known to her. If the phrases had occurred\nin Mrs. Piper's trance, I should feel much less confidence as to\ntheir origin. It follows that there may be cases in which the\nfact that something is within an automatisms normal knowledge\nadds to the evidence for supernormal interaction hetween the\nscripts of different automatists. See e.g. the composite Brown-\ning-Tennyson quotation in Mrs. Holland's script of April 8,\n1907, below, p. 112.\nThe scripts are like the literary productions of cultivated\nwriters in that subjects are often alluded to, instead of being\ndefinitely mentioned, and the allusion often implies some\nliterary or historical association, so that a great deal of meaning\nis sometimes contained in a single short phrase. But they carry\nus a step further than ordinary literary productions in this\nway : for, whereas in studying a poem, such as the Divina\nCommedia or Aristophanes' Apology, we often find light thrown\non one passage by (among other things) another passage in\nthe same poem ; in studying the scripts, we often find that\nlight is thrown on the script of one writer by a passage in the\nscript of another writer, when there has been no normal com-\nmunication between the two writers. In the case of the poem,\nthe continuity of thought is naturally to be accounted for by\nits being all the work of the same author. And the continuity\nof thought throughout the scripts would suggest that their\ncontinuity is to be accounted for in a similar way,\u2014namely,\nthat they too are all essentially due to the same author.\nI here use the words \" author \" and \" writer \" to express\ntwo different things. By the word \" author \" I mean the\n\f10 Alice Johnson. [part\nintelligence\u2014whether one or several\u2014behind the scripts ;\nand by the word \" writer \" I mean the person who performs\nthe act of writing,\u2014the automatist. An author may either\nwrite his own compositions or get some one else to write\nthem for him. But the terms may be used without prejudice\nas to what the relation of the author to the writer is, and\nwithout implying any view as to the \" author's \" nature.\nIf the different scripts are not all essentially due to the\nsame \" author,\" we must suppose that the supernormal con-\nnections between them are the result of telepathy between the\nwriters, aided perhaps by telepathy to the writers from\nthe investigators in charge of the scripts. We have seen that\nthe scripts are obscure in the same way that literary works are\noften obscure, through their allusiveness and their great con-\nciseness. But they have also special obscurities of their own,\n\u2014due, as I believe, to the \" author's \" deliberate intention to\nprevent their being understood, so as to prevent the ideas\nbeing transferred telcpathically from one writer to another, and\nthus to afford evidence of his own independent activity. The\nproblem before the \" author,\" on this hypothesis, is to express\nthe fragments of a cross-correspondence, distributed among the\nscripts of two or more writers, in so veiled and obscure a form\nthat no one will guess what they mean, and yet so explicitly\nthat, when once the clue is found, there can be no doubt of\ntheir meaning. 1\nTo combine these two conditions must\nbe a task of great difficulty, and one in which he may not\nalways succeed. But the hypothesis that this is his aim\ngives, at least, a perfectly rational explanation of the nature\nof the scripts.\nThis deliberate concealment of his meaning on the part of the\n\" author \" is comparable with the precautions taken in experi-\nments in telepathy between two living persons, to prevent\nthe percipient discovering by normal means the idea which\nthe agent is trying to transfer to him telepathically. In this\nlatter case, material obstacles are used to prevent the physical\naction of the senses : we put up an opaque screen or wall\nbetween agent and percipient, or we separate them by a\ngreat distance in space. Our \" author,\" on the other hand,\n1\nThe Riddle of the Sphinx is a simple but excellent instance of this\nkind of enigma\n\flxviii.] Some \" Concordant Automatism*.\"\nhas to prevent the mental action of telepathy between the\nwriters, and he does this by interposing between them the\nmental barrier of the unintelligibility of the scripts.\nI do not, of course, mean to assert that all the obscurities in\nthe scripts are due to the deliberate intention of the \" author \" ;\nsome, no doubt, may arise from his failing to convey to the\nwriter exactly what he wished to express. But in a great\nmany cases, what we took, after careful study, to be vague\nand incoherent or meaningless statements have been found,\non further investigation, to have a clear and rational meaning,\nwhich shows that there is much more intelligence behind\nthe scripts than for long we supposed ; and we believe that\nthere is still much more to be discovered in them.\nThe cases given in this paper relate to scripts many of\nwhich have been published in whole or in part in earlier reports,\nespecially in my first report on Mrs. Holland's script in Proc,\nVol. XXI., and Mr. Piddington's paper, \" A Series of Con-\ncordant Automatisms,\" in Proc, Vol. XXII. Since some of\nthe most essential points were then missed for want of the\nproper clues, it will be convenient to quote here again the\ngreater part of the scripts in question, as well as a number of\nhitherto unpublished ones ; and I propose to do this as far as\npossible in the chronological order of the scripts, so that the\nreader may judge how one event led on to the next.\nCHAPTER I.\nCross-Correspondence: \" Ave Roma Immortalis.\"\n\" The destiny of the Eternal City is without doubt the con-\nception which, throughout the long roll of human history, has\ncome nearest to the unchangeable and the divine.\"\n(F. W. H. Myers, Classical Essays ; Virgil, p. 152.)\n\" And even as it was not in truth the great ghost of Hector\nonly, but the whole nascent race of Rome, which bore from the\nTrojan altar the hallowing fire, so it is not one Saviour only, but\nthe whole nascent race of man\u2014nay, all the immeasurable progeny\nand population of the heavens\u2014which issues continually from\n\fL2 Alice John son. [part\nbehind the veil of Being, and forth from the Sanctuary of the\nUniverse carries the ever-burning flame.\"\n(F. W. H. Myers, Human Personality, Vol. II., p. 292.)\nThis ease, in which Mrs. Verrall and Mrs. Holland only\nwere concerned, was first published in Proceedings, Vol. XXI.,\npp. 297-303. The scripts were then interpreted as alluding\nto Raphael's picture of the meeting of Pope Leo I. (St. Leo)\nwith Attila, King of the Huns, in 452. As Attila with his\narmy approached Rome, the Pope went out unarmed to\npersuade him to retire. In the picture, reproduced below\n(Plate I.), St. Peter and St. Paul, the two chief guardian\nsaints of the city, are seen descending from the sky, as in\nthe traditional story, to reinforce the appeal of the Pope.\nSt. Peter carries his two keys, and also a sword in his other\nhand ; St. Paul bears his usual emblem, the sword. Attila,\non the black horse in the centre, starts back in terror from\nthe vision.\nThe scripts were as follows :\n{Mrs. Verrall' s Script of March 2, 190(3.)\n(Drawing of bulrush) bulrushes\nnon tali auxilio invenies quod velis\nnon tali auxilio nee defensoribus istis\n1\n[Not with such help will you find what you want.\nNot with such help, nor with those defenders of yours]\nKeep the two distinct\u2014you do not hear Avrite regularly\u2014give\nup other things.\nPrimus inter pares ipse non nominis immemor\u2014cum eo frater\netsi non sanguine animo consanguineus ii ambo tibi per aliam\nvocem mittent\u2014post aliquot dies bene quod dicam comprehendere\n2>otes. usque ad illud vale.\n[First among his peers, himself not unmindful of his name ;\nwith him a brother related in feeling, though not in blood. Both\nthese will send a message to you through another woman. After\nsome days you will easily understand what I say ; till then farewell.]\nMrs. Verrall recognised the first Latin passage as being a\nquotation from the Aeneid,\u2014the words used by Hecuba\n1\nVirgil, Acn. II. 521.\n\flxviii.] Some \" Con cord'an f Automatisms.\" L3\nwhen she saw the aged Priam putting on his armour in the\nvain hope of defending Troy against the Greeks, who had\nalready entered it ; but the second Latin passage' had no\nmeaning or association for her. She showed the script to\nDr. Verrall on the same day, and asked him who was described\nas \" Primus inter pares.\" He answered \" The Pope,\" and he\nalso said that he saw a connection between the two Latin\npassages, but he did not tell her what it was.\nHis mention of the Pope probably had some influence on\nher next script, which was :\n{Mrs. VerralVs Script of March 4, 1906.)\nPagan and Pope. The Stoic persecutor and the Christian.\nGregory not Basil's friend ought to be a clue but you have it not\nquite right.\nPagan and Pope and Reformer all enemies as\nyou think\nCrux significationem habet.

The\nfour pictures in the Stanza dell' Eliodoro were painted by\nhim (1512-1514) to symbolise the divine help afforded to the\nChurch against external and internal enemies, with special\nreference to the recent expulsion of the French from Italy\nby those two Popes and the victory of the Papacy at the\nLateran Council of 1512-1517. Three of the four pictures 2\nillustrate the supremacy of the spiritual power\u2014in the per-\nson of the Head of the Church\u2014over the material power.\nOne represents Heliodorus driven out of the Temple by an\napparition of three angels (2 Maccabees, III., 24-27), sym-\nbolising the expulsion of the French from the States of the\nChurch by Julius II. ;\nanother, the deliverance of St. Peter\nfrom prison by an angel, symbolising the escape of Leo X.\n(then a Cardinal) from the French in 1512, after he had been\ntaken prisoner by them at the battle of Ravenna ; the third\nis the turning back of Attila by Leo I., with the miraculous\nhelp of the two Apostles, symbolising the expulsion of the\nFrench from Italy by Leo X. after the battle of Novara in\n1513. The Pope in the picture is a portrait of Leo X., who\nalso appears in it as one of the Cardinals, since he was a\nCardinal when Raphael began to paint it.\nKeeping these circumstances in mind, we may go on to\nconsider the scripts in detail.\n1\nAs in several other cases, Dr. Maxwell ignores or misrepresents many\nof the fundamental features. He ignores the close relationship between\nTroy and Rome, which could hardly fail to be in the mind of any one\nquoting from the Aeneid. He says that the application of the phrase\nprimus inter pares to the Pope is doubtful. This is a mistake ; the\nphrase is constantly used with reference to the claims of the Papacy.\nHe also ignores all the circumstances connected with the painting of the\npicture and what it was intended to symbolise,\u2014to much of which the\nscripts are appropriate.\n2\nThe fourth picture is the Miraculous Mass of Bolsena\n\fHi \u00ab \"AUee Johnson.

The Stoic persecutor and the Christian.\"\nThese words were regarded by Dr. Verrall as a vague reference\nto Raphael's picture (partly erroneous, because the \" Stoic\nPersecutor \" had nothing to do with it) ; but I feel no doubt\nthat the phrases refer to the fact that Pope Sixtus V. in 1588\nplaced a statue of St. Peter (the first \" Pope \" of Rome) on\nthe top of the Column of Trajan, where a statue of the Emperor\nTrajan (the \" Pagan \") had once stood ; and similarly in 1580\nplaced a statue of St. Paul (the \" Christian *')\non the Column\nof Marcus Aurelius, where a statue of Marcus Aurelius (\" the\nStoic Persecutor\"') had originally stood.\nIllustrations of these two Columns are given below (Plate II.\nand Plate III.), the two Apostles being distinguished, as in\nRaphael's picture, by their usual emblems of the keys and\nthe sword.\nThe Forum of Trajan 1\n(built 107-113 a.d.) consisted origin-\nally of a large open space, the Forum proper, entered by the\nArch of Trajan at one end, and leading at the other into the\nBasilica Ulpia, a large roofed building with colonnades all\nround the inner walls. Beyond was a small quadrangular\nopen space, containing the Column ; on each side of which\nwas a building containing respectively the Greek and Latin\nLibraries of the Bibliotheca Ulpia. Beyond these again was\nthe Temple of Trajan. The two libraries were the largest of\nall the public libraries in Rome, and they were used for literary\ndiscussions and poetical recitations up to the end of the seventh\ncentury a.d.\nThe part now excavated consists only of the space sur-\nrounding the Column and part of the area of the Basilica\nimmediately in front of it, in which some fragments of the\npillars have been arranged in rows. The bas-reliefs which run\nspirally round the Column represent scenes from Trajan's\nDacian campaigns, from 101 a.d. onwards.\nThe original Forum, which was built by the Greek archi-\n1\nFor a full description of the Forum, see The Remains of Ancient Borne,\nby J.

During the Middle\nAges it formed an almost inexhaustible quarry for marbles used\nin countless churches and palaces of Rome. A few of the\nsculptural groups have been preserved through their having\nbeen removed and built into the Arch of Constantine (312 a.d.),\nand these are among the finest existing specimens of Graeco-\nRoman decorative work. In one of them Trajan is seated on\na throne, below which are various standing figures whom he is\naddressing, one a woman with a child. \" Some such relief\nas this, or perhaps the common subject of Trajan raising a\nkneeling province, was probably the origin of the beautiful\nstory of Trajan and the widow quoted by Dante \" 1\n(see\nbelow).\nThe Column of Marcus Aurelius stood originally in front\nof the temple which was dedicated to him, and the whole was\nsurrounded by a peribolus forming a sort of Forum like\nTrajan's, but smaller. The Column was built in imitation of\nTrajan's, being of the same height and encircled in the same\nmanner by spiral bas-reliefs, which represent scenes in four\ncampaigns of Marcus Aurelius against the German tribes\nnorth of the Danube in 167-179 a.d. It is, however, distinctly\ninferior in workmanship. It stands in the middle of the present-\nPiazza Colonna, which thence derives its name.\nIncidentally it may be noted that a reference to \" the Stoic\npersecutor and the Christian \" is appropriate as coming from\nMyersv , since both were men for whom F. W. H. Myers had\na special admiration, as shown by his poem St. Paid and\nhis essay on Marcus Aurelius (Essays\u2014Classical, pp. 177\net. seq.), in which he compares and contrasts the two men.\nThe story of Trajan and the widow who begged for justice\non the murderers of her son, which he delayed one of his\ncampaigns to grant, is twice referred to by Dante. In Purga-\ntorio, X. 73-9G, he describes this as one of the sculptured\nscenes depicted on the marble side of the first terrace of the\nMount of Purgatory. In Paradiso, XX.

The latter's close\nconnection with Trajan justifies the remark that \" Gregory\nought to be a clue.\" In his time, much of Trajan's Forum was\nstill remaining in its original splendour.\n\" Pagan and Pope and Reformer\u2014all enemies as you think\n\"\nseems to be a further allusion to the same topic, implying\nthat it is a mistake to suppose that these personages are\nnecessarily enemies. The epithet \"Reformer\" might well\nbe applied to Gregory I.\n\" The cross has a. meaning\u2014the cross-bearer who one day is\nhomer This is probably another reference to St. Peter,\nwho was crucified and is frecmently represented in art with\na cross.\nReturning to the phrase Primus inter pares in the script of\nMarch 2, 1906, this seems to make a link with the present\nscript, for it is at least as appropriate to Gregory I. as to\nLeo I., if not more so. The feebleness of the Emperors at\nConstantinople had led gradually to so much increase in the\npower of the Pope that, by the time of Gregory I., he had\nbecome the practical ruler of Rome, organising the national\ndefences and treating with barbaric invaders, while insisting\nat the same time on his spiritual authority. \" Gregory at\n1\nParadiso, XX. 112-117 (Temple Edition, trans, by Wicksteed).\n\f20 Alice Johnson.

In the\npicture the Apostles are overawing Attila and his Huns ; on\nthe Columns they are triumphing over two Pagan Emperors\nwho persecuted the Christians.\nThere is also a special connection in the fact that Raphael,\nwho, like other cultivated men of his time, took an interest\nin Roman antiquities (as shown by the introduction of the\nColosseum and other ruins into the background of his picture),\ncopied the scale armour of his Huns from that of the Sarmatian\nsoldiers on Trajan's Column. 2\nMy illustrations, Plate IV. and\nPlate V., show this.

It also seems clear that the\n\" lion's skin \" is intended as a double reference to Hercules,\nthe wearer of the lion's skin, and to another \" claviger\n\"\n(key-bearer), viz.

XIV. 270). In a\npassage describing the greed for gain which takes men to\nsea, in spite of its perils, he says that \" leaving Calpe far\nbehind, they will hear the sun hiss in the waters of Hercules,\"\nreferring to a notion that if you went far enough west you\nmight hear the sun hiss as he sank into the sea.\nMayor's note on this passage is :\n\" Calpe (Gibraltar) and\nAbyla on the opposite coast were known as the Pillars of\nHercules, which are often spoken of as the extreme west. . . .\nYet even this '\nworld's end '\nthe adventurer leaves far behind\nhim.\"\nThus it seems that the mention of Hercules in the script\nleads ou to the \" columnae \" of Hercules, which in their\nturn lead on to\n\" Assiduo lectore columnae (the columns [broken] by inces-\nsant reading).\" This is another phrase from Juvenal (tiat. I.\n13), occurring in a description of a reader who recited or\ndeclaimed with so much vehemence as to break the \" plane-\ntrees, marbles and columns \" of the house in which he was\nreciting.\nIn the autumn of 1012 I told Mrs. Verrall of my interpreta-\ntion of her script of March 4, 1006, as alluding to the Columns\nof Trajan and Marcus Aurelius, and discussed it with her.\nShe then told me that Dr. Verrall and she were in Rome only\nonce, in March, 1802, when, among other things, they had\nseen and been specially interested in Raphael's pictures in\nthe Vatican. Dr. Verrall had also studied Trajan's Column,\nand made notes on certain obscure points in the inscription\non its base, and certain points of comparison between it and\nthe Column of Marcus Aurelius. Later he wrote a paper\non the subject which was read at a meeting of the Cambridge\nPhilological Society, but has not been published. Mrs. Verrall,\nafter telling me about it, found the MS., and looked through\nit. She tells me that there is no mention in it of St. Peter\nor St. Paul. Though she and her husband both probably\nknew at the time of their visit to Rome that the statues of St .\n\f22 Alice Johnson. [part\nPeter and St. Paul had been put in the place of the original\nstatues at the top of these Columns, she was sure that they had\ntaken no interest in the fact ; and indeed when I told her of\nit, she did not remember that she had ever heard it before.\nIt seems certain that Dr. Verrall had not detected any allusion\nto the Columns in the scripts, probably because he was thinking\nonly of their allusions to Raphael's picture.\nIn his note written on March 11th, 1906, 1\nhe said that the\nfirst script \" did in fact instantly recall to me the picture\nmentioned (doubtless only because I am specially familiar\nwith it) ;\n\" and the two later ones, in the words \" Pagan,\"\n\" Pope,\" \" reformer,\" \" Crucifer,\" \" Leonis \" and \" Claviger\n\"\nseemed to him to be carrying on the allusions to the picture,\nthough apparently mixed with erroneous or irrelevant details.\nIn another cross-correspondence related below, \" The Clavi-\ngers,\" we shall find Mrs. Verrall's scripts apparently influenced\nagain by reminiscences of this visit to Rome, and again the\npoints that emerge in the scripts are subsidiary details of\nwhat she had seen, unnoticed or but little noticed by her at\nthe time.\nMrs. Holland's Script op March 7, 1\n(\nJ06.\n\" Ave Roma immortalis.

The reference is given in the words of Virgil. Then\nwe come to St. Peter and St. Paul, who introduced Christianity\ninto Rome ; to Trajan, the type of Roman justice, who built\nthe most magnificent Forum of the city ; to Marcus Aurelius,\nthe Stoic Philosopher ; to Pope Leo I., whose repulse of\nAttila has been regarded as the first important indication\nof the growing political influence of the Papacy ; to Gregory I.,\nwho completed the transformation of the Roman State into\n1 See Proceedings, Vol. XXI., p. 299.\n\flxviii.] Some \" Concordant Automatisms.\" 23\nthe Roman Church. As to the two Popes for whom Raphael\npainted his picture of St. Leo meeting Attila, Julius II. brought\nboth Michael Angelo and Raphael to Rome to adorn the\nVatican, pulled down the old Church of St. Peter's, because it\nwas not large enough to contain the magnificent tomb which he\nhad planned for himself (which tomb, by the way, forms an\nessential factor in a later cross-correspondence, see below, p. 137),\nand began to build the present St. Peter's. Leo X. was the\ngreat patron of art and literature ; he founded the University\nof Rome, and added largely to the art treasures of the Vatican ;\nit was he also who started the sale of Indulgences, which roused\nthe protest of Luther, and so brought to a head the gathering\nforces of the Reformation.\nFinally, Sixtus V. (1585-1590), who put the statues of\nSt. Peter and St. Paul on the two Columns, was the Pope\nchiefly responsible for the planning and rebuilding which\nhas given the city its modern appearance. He laid out on\nthe north-eastern heights a series of long straight streets,\nregardless of ancient landmarks, and built a great acmeduct\nfor the supply of that region. Under him, the dome of St.\nPeter's, planned by Michael Angelo, was completed. He\nalso built\u2014for a summer residence for the Popes\u2014the Quirinal\nPalace, which was taken possession of by Victor Emanuel\nin 1870, and became thenceforth the Royal Palace of Italy.\nIt seems then that there is much more point than was\nat first apparent in the application of Mrs. Holland's phrase\n\" Ave Roma immortalis \" to the scripts which involve this\nhistory. The history is all implicit in the scattered items of\nMrs. Verrall's scripts, but it is latent, or, as we may say, held\nin solution in them, till Mrs. Holland's \" Ave Roma im-\nmortalis \" gives the final touch which crystallises it into\nform and without which we might never have observed its\nexistence.\nOf all the cities which now hold a first rank in the world,\nRome has the longest continuous history, and the influence\nthat it has exercised and still exercises over the human race\nis perhaps hardly to be exaggerated.

This theme is further\ndeveloped in the scripts given below under the headings\n\" auras ovpavos uKVjuow \" and \" The Clavigers.\"\nCHAPTER II,\nThe Theory of Cross-Correspondences and the\nLatin Message.\nAbout a month after the cross-correspondence just described\nhad occurred, viz. in April, 1906, the theory that cross-\ncorrespondences were expressly designed to provide evidence\nfor something transcending telepathy between the minds of\nthe automatists was first definitely formulated, as stated in\nmy first report on Mrs. Holland's script (Proceedings, Vol.\nXXI., p. 362, and pp. 369-391). In the autumn of the same\nyear Mr. Piddington and I, in view of the sittings with Mrs.\nPiper which were about to be held in London, devised the\nexperiment of a \" Latin Message \" to be addressed to MyersP\nin Latin. The original English version of the Message was\nas follows :\nWe are aware of the scheme of cross-correspondences which\nyou are transmitting through various mediums, and we hope that\nyou will go on with them.\n1 \" The Implicit Promise of Immortality \" (The Renewal of Youth and\nother Poems, p. 53).\n2\nIn March, 1899.\n\fL XVIII.] Some \" Concordant Automatisms.\" 25\nTry also to give to A and 1> two different messages, between\nwhich no connection is discernible. Then as soon as possible give\nto C a third message which will reveal the hidden connection.\nIt appeared to us that if the experiment succeeded and\ncross-correspondences of the desired type occurred, they\nwould afford almost conclusive evidence of the agency of a\nmind external to those of all the automatists, and might\nafford strong evidence of the identity of this mind.\nThe conversations with MyersP about this experiment are\nrecorded in detail by Mr. Piddington in Proceedings, Vol.\nXXII., pp. 312-414, and a good deal of ink has since\nbeen spilt over the secondary question of whether MyersP\nhad enough \" Myers \" in him to be able to translate the\nLatin in which the Message was delivered to him. The\nprimary question, of course, was whether \" Myers \" understood\nthe purport of the Message 1\nand could prove his understanding\nto us by 'producing the kind of cross-correspondence we wanted.\nMy excuse for reverting to the subject now is that in Mr.\nPiddington's original report and generally in the subsequent\ndiscussion, the assumption has been made that \" Hope, Star\nand Browning \" was the cross-correspondence especially\nintended to meet our wishes, and the discussion has mostly\nturned on its appropriateness to the Latin Message.\nSome of the clues lately found to the real meaning of many\nof the scripts, however, show that several other cases\u2014in\nparticular that described below under the heading\n<:\nAlex-\nander's Tomb \"\u2014conform much more definitely than \" Hope.\nStar and Browning \" to the type asked for in the Message.\nMeanwhile I give the latter case first, for the sake of includ-\ning in it the contributions to the subject in Mrs. Holland's\nscript, which have not yet been published.\nTo make these intelligible, I prefix a joint chronological\nsummary of the Latin Message Experiment and the most\nimportant allusions to\n' ;\nHope, Star and Browning \" made\nin Mrs. Piper's trance, these two topics being inextricably\nmingled in her case.\n1 An interesting discussion of the intelligence shown by MyersF in this\nexperiment is to be found in Mrs. Hude's paper in Proceedings, Vol. XXVI.,\npp. 147-170.\n\f26 Alice Johnson.

When a statement was found to be correct, he as a\nrule informed MyersP of it. For these and all other details\nof the case, his original report must be referred to.\nAs to the automatists' knowledge that the experiment of\nthe Latin Message was to be tried :\n(a) Mrs. Verrall was fully acquainted with it.\n(b) Miss Verrall must be assumed to have known some-\nthing about it, since she was present at the sitting of Dec. 19,\n1906, when part of the message was dictated to Mrs. Piper\nin trance. 1\n(c) To Mrs. Piper the subject was mentioned only while\nshe was in trance, and the Message was dictated in Latin to\nthe trance-personalities.\n(d) Mrs. Holland, who was in India at the time, knew\nnothing whatever about the experiment, and did not even\nknow till near the end of March, 1907, that Mrs. Piper had\ncome to England to give us sittings.\nThe knowledge or ignorance of the automatists about the\nLatin Message had of course no bearing on the evidential\nvalue of the cross-correspondences, but it might have had\nsome effect on the wording of the scripts.\nChronological Summary of the Latin Message Experiment.\nDuring the first half of Nov., 1906, J.

MyersP says he will reply to the Latin Mes-\nsage as soon as he can.\nFeb. 11, 1907. MyersP says Mrs. Verrall has got Hope, Star\nand Browning in her script.\nFeb. 11, 1907 {later in the day). J. G. P. takes Mrs. Verrall's\nscripts of Jan. 23 and Jan. 28, 1907 (see below), to cor-\nrespond to this statement, and, reading Abt Vogler for\nthe first time, concludes that the line, \" That out of three\nsounds he frame, not a fourth sound, but a star,\" would\nbe especially appropriate to the Latin Message.\nFeb. 12, 1907. J. G. P. tells MyersP that he was right in\nsaying Mrs. Verrall had got Star, Hope and Browning\nin her script.\nFeb. 26, 1907. J. G. P. asks HodgsonP to tell MyersP that\nMrs. Verrall had drawn a triangle within a circle in one\nof her scripts.\nFeb. 27, 1907. MyersP says that Star, Hope and Browning\nis his answer to the Latin Message.\nMar. 6, 1907. MyersP says he said Bird and Paradise in\nconnection with the triangle and circle, and refers again\nto Browning, Hope and Star.\nMar. 13, 1907. MyersP says the circle was connected with\nBrowning, Hope and Star, and also calls the circle a\nRing.\nMar. 20, 1907. MyersP refers again to Browning, Hope\nand Star.\nApril 8, 1907. MyersP says that one of the other automatists\nhas drawn a Star and a Crescent.\nMay 6, 1907. MyersP says he long ago gave the word Music\nin this connection.\n\f28 Alice Johnson. [part\nCHAPTER 111.\nCross-Correspondence :\n\" Hope, Star and Browning.\"\nFour automatists, Mrs. Piper, Mrs. Holland, Mrs. Verrall\nand Miss Verrall, were concerned in this case. The part\nplayed by Mrs. Piper is summarised above, and the dates of\nMyersp's statements should be compared with those of the\nscripts of the other automatists, which are given below in\nchronological order.\nMrs. Holland's scripts were, as usual, being sent from\nIndia to me, and she knew nothing of what was being pro-\nduced by the other automatists ; while Mrs. Verrall, the\nonly one to Avhom I gave any information about Mrs. Hol-\nland's scripts, saw those here dealt with for the first time\non Feb. 19, 1907\u2014that is, after all her own and Miss Verrall's\nscripts relating to this subject had been written.\nHere, as throughout this paper, some of the scripts quoted\nmay seem to have but a vague and dubious connection with\nthe topics of the cross-correspondence. But. since the references\nin them appear to be continuous with the more definite and\nexplicit references in other or later scripts, I include the\nvaguer scripts as well as the others, on the general principles\nexplained in my Introduction ;\nfor, if these vaguer scripts are\nreally continuous with the others, it is probable that they really\nrefer to the same topics.\nThus, in the following script, it would seem that the topics\narc only beginning to emerge :\n(Mrs. Holland's Script of Dec. 3, 1906.)\nNowell\n\u2014\" (So doth the Greater Glory dim the less \" 1\nliundell\n\u2014\nRundall\n\u2014\n1 \" Portia.

But we find in Mrs. Holland's script of March\n20, 1907, below, pp. 42-46, which contains more definite\nreferences to this cross-correspondence, that the Moon again\noccurs implicitly,\u2014that is, in the context of a quotation given\nin the script, \u2014and this time it is a Crescent Moon.\nThis is an instance of what has just been explained :\n\u2014since\nthe Moon in the second script seems clearly one of the topics\nof the cross-correspondence, and since the first script appears\ncontinuous with the second, there is reason to regard the\nMoon of the first script as an item of the same cross-corre-\nspondence.\n1 \" Ah. dream too bright to last !\nAh, starry Hope ! that didst arise\nBut to be overcast !\n\"\n(E. A. Poe, To One in Paradise.)\n- For full details, see Proc, Vol. XXII., p. 76.\n3 For full details, see Proc, Vol. XXII., pp. 72 and 339.\n\f30 Alice Johnson.

Though Mrs. Verrall did\nnot know on what day the experiment with Mrs. Piper would\nbegin, she was aware that it was to be tried, and this script\nseems\u2014in part at least\u2014to reflect her own conception of it.\nBut the particular symbolism employed\u2014which, for brevity,\nwe may call \" the music of the spheres \"\u2014became, as will\nbe seen, one of the main items of this cross-correspondence.\n1\nThis phrase constitutes a possible cross-eorrespondenco with Mrs. Piper.\nSee Proc, Vol. XXII., p. 40.\n2\nHartley Coleridge, Prayer. The words italicised are underlined in the\noriginal script.\n3\nBrowning, James Lee's Wife, IV. :\n\" I will he quiet and talk with you,\nAnd reason why you are wrong.\nYou wanted my love\u2014is that much true ?\nAnd so I did love, so I do :\nWhat has come of it all along ?\n\"\n\flxviii.] Some \" Concordant Automatisms.\" 31\n(Mrs. VerralVs Script of Dec. 17, 1906.) 1\nRevolving axes\nRevolving spheres the mystic music make\nRevolving spheres the harmony began\nHarmonious sound scarce audible to man\nBut Then from every several unit of the whole\nJoined the majestic music of the Soul\nno no\nMajestic music\nNo\u2014you dont see what I want\u2014begin again.\nRevolving spheres the harmony began\n\u2014\nA diapason manifest to man\n\u2014\nEach single unit played its several part\nDiscoursing symphony with god-sent art\nTill the majestic music of the whole\nThrobbed in pulsation : \u2014and the throbbing Soul\nSaw through the sound the burning of the flame\nFelt the lost Presence\u2014to the Presence came.\nMuch of the phraseology of this script is derived from two\nsources (both familiar to Mrs. Verrall), viz. (1) Dryden's Song\nfor St. Cecilia's Day, especially the lines :\n\" From harmony, from heavenly harmony.\nTins universal frame began :\nFrom harmony to harmony\nThrough all the compass of the notes it ran,\nThe diapason closing full in Man.\nAs from the power of sacred lays\nThe spheres began to move.\"\nand (2) the translations by F.

The second was given at\nDelphi to a friend of Porphyry's who enquired, \" Where is now Plotinus'\nsoul ?\n\"\n\f32 Alice Johnson.

But the script embroiders on the\nideas thence derived, adding something of its own. In par-\nticular the phrase\n\" the throbbing Soul\nSaw through the sound the burning of the flame\n\"\nseems, as Mr. Piddington observed in- his Report, to fore-\nshadow the quotation from Abt Vogler :\n\" That out of three sounds he frame, not a fourth sound, but a\nstar,\"\nwhich played so important a part later in tire cross-cor-\nrespondence.\n{Mrs. Holland'* Script of Dec. 19, 1906.)\n....

Maitland's death,\nand Mrs. Verrall, to whom I showed it (on Feb. 19, 1907)\nthought that some passages in it were meant to refer to him.\n\"It is only in appearance that the life appears unduly\nbrief ...\" had a certain appropriateness, as he was only\n56 when he died. But Mrs. Verrall attached more importance\nto the words \" H. December 21st, don't you remember ?\nM.\" since it was on Dec. 21, 1906, that she heard of Pro-\nfessor Maitland's death (which had occurred in the Canary\nIsles), whereas on Dec. 21 of the previous year she had heard\nof Dr. Hodgson's death. Further, \" the pink may-blossom\non the trees near the drive \" was appropriate to her house,\nwell known to Professor Maitland ;\nwhile, in accordance\nwith the punning habits of scripts, 1\nit may be supposed that\n\" May \" (the name by which Mrs. Verrall's friends call her)\nimplies a connection of the script with her in two respects,\nboth in regard to her friend, Professor Maitland, and as con-\ntaining a cross-correspondence with her own script.\nSome confirmation of the supposed reference here to Pro-\nfessor Maitland is afforded by the facts that Mrs. Holland's\nscript of Oct. 17, 1906, appeared to be premonitory of his\nlast voyage to the Canary and of his death (see Proceedings,\nVol. XXIV., p. 217) ; and that her script of March 20, 1907\n(see below, p. 42), undoubtedly refers to him, contains further\nallusions to \" Hope, Star and Browning \" and seems closely\nconnected with this script of Dec. 19, 1906 ;\nthough on March\n20, 1907, she was unaware that these earlier scripts had been\ninterpreted as referring to Professor Maitland.\n1\nThus in Miss Verrall's scripts of Feb. 3 and 17, 1907, below, the phrase\n\" Song birds pipe their tune \" and the allusions to the Pied Piper are clearly\nreferences to Mrs. Piper.\nC\n*\n\f34 Alice Johnson. [part\nThe context of the quotation in the script from Sordello 1\nis as follows :\n\" For he is thine !\nSordello, thy forerunner, Florentine !\nA herald-star I know thou didst absorb\nRelentless into the consummate orb\nThat scared it from its right to roll along\nA sempiternal path with dance and song,\nStill, what if I ... .\n.... launch once more\nThat lustre ?

Why not that motto for the\nring ? It applies to both sides.\" I regard this as an allusion\nto the following passage from The Ring and the Book (Book I.) :\n\" A ring without a posy, 2\nand that ring mine ?\n0 lyric Love, half angel and half bird\nAnd all a wonder and a wild desire,\n1\nIt will be remembered that Sordello was an Italian poet\u2014like Virgil, a\nnative of Mantua\u2014whom Dante met in Purgatory.\n2\nIn the completo edition of Browning's Poems, edited by A. Birrell (the\nnotes to The Ring and the Book being by F. G. Kenyon), the following foot-\nnote is attached to this word :\n\" Posy : a motto or rhyme, engraved inside\na ring.\"\n\flxviii.] Some \" Concordant Automatisms.\" 35\nWhen the first summons from the darkling earth\nReached thee amid thy chambers, blanched their blue,\nAnd bared them of the glory\u2014to drop down,\nTo toil for man, to suffer or to die,\n\u2014\nThis is the same voice : can thy soul know change ?\nHail then, and hearken from the realms of help !\n\"\n\" Qui bien ayme tard oublye \" is of course a very appro-\npriate motto for Browning's Ring, and the phrase \" it applies\nto both sides,\" if taken to mean that it applies both to heaven\nand earth, fits in closely with the whole sentiment of his\nhalf mystic and half personal appeal to \" Lyric Love.\" It\nis also very appropriate to the general gist of Abt Vogler, and\nespecially to these lines (Stanza IV.) :\n\" And the emulous heaven yearned down, made effort to\nreach the earth,\nAs the earth had done her best, in my passion, to scale\nthe sky.\"\nIt will be seen that Mrs. Verrall's script of Jan. 28, 1907,\nquotes both from the above passage in The Ring and the Booh\nand from Abt Vogler.\n{Mrs. Verrall's Script of Jan. 23, 1907.)\nJustice holds the scales.\nThat gives the words but an anagram would be better\nTell him that\u2014 rats star tars and so on.

It will be noticed that this particular sign appears\nin this script.\n\" The ivorld's wonder \" is a quotation from a poem to which\nMrs. Verrall's own script of Dec. 17, 1906, alluded ; while\n\" all a wonder and a wild desire \" is a quotation from a passage\nin The Ring and the Book to which Mrs. Holland's script of\nDec. 19, 1906, as I believe, alluded (see above).\nThe leading idea of the script is clearly Love, or Passion,\n\u2014\nemphasised, as the leading ideas are apt to be, by various\ndevices. The word itself occurs only twice,\u2014both times in\nits Greek form,2\n\u2014but several of the quotations turn on it,\nnamely :\n(1)\n\" O lyric Love, half angel and half bird,\nAnd all a wonder and a wild desire.\"\n(2) The \" Prince of Love \" who, in Blake's song, imprisons\nthe lover in a cage and mocks his loss of liberty ; and (3) the\n\" passion that left the ground to lose itself in the sky.\"\nThe reminiscences of Abt Vogler in this script are of special\ninterest. In most cases the phrases are not taken direct from\nthe poem, but compounded out of two or more phrases in it,\nso that a single sentence is ingeniously turned to express\ntwo or more ideas, as in several other cases given in this paper.\nWhile the number of allusions seem to point to a general\nreference to the whole poem, the individual variations are all,\nas I believe, intentional. I will give the original passages\n1 Browning, Abt Vogler.\n2\nSomewhat similarly in the case of the cross-correspondence Thanatos,\nMrs. Verrall on April 29, 1907, produced a script containing four quota-\ntions involving the notion of Death, but the word itself occurred once only,\nas mors (see Proceedings, Vol. XXII., p. 299).\n\f38 Alice Johnson. [part\nin full, in the order in which they are alluded to in the\nscript :\n(1)\n\" The high that proved too high, the heroic for earth too hard,\nThe passion that left the ground to lose itself in the sky,\nAre music sent up to God. ...\"\nHere note that the script substitutes \" hope \" for \" pas-\nsion,\"\u2014a device probably intended, as Mr. Piddington\npointed out, to emphasise \" hope \" by drawing attention\nto it, for no one familiar with the poem could fail to notice\nthe misquotation, and Mrs. Verrall, in her contemporary\nnotes, remarked on it.\nThe script too, instead of \" to lose itself,\" has \" that\nfound itself or lost itself,\"\u2014thus hinting at the conception of\nindividual persistence, as contrasted with that of absorption\ninto a greater whole, which is suggested by the original\nphrase. 1\n(2)\n\" But here is the finger of God, a flash of the will that can,\nExistent behind all laws, that made them and, lo, they are !\nAnd I know not if, save in this, such gift be allowed to man,\nThat out of three sounds he frame, not a fourth sound,\nbut a star.\"\n(3) \" On the earth the broken arcs ; in the heaven, a perfect round.'\nThese two passages from the poem are, I take it, repre-\nsented in a highly concise and conglomerate manner in the\nscript by :\nAster [star] rtpas [a sign or wonder]. . . .\nOn the earth the broken sounds\u2014threads\n\u2014\nIn the sky the perfect arc\n\" The finger of God \" is a Biblical phrase, used in connec-\ntion with something done as a sign of the power of God, e.g.,\n\" Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger\nof God \" {Exodus, viii. 19), referring to the plagues of Egypt ;\n\" If I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the\nkingdom of God is come upon you \" {Luke, xi. 20) ;\n1\nSomewhat similarly MyersP ,\nquoting from Abt Vogler, attempted to\nimprove on his text when he said that he had \" returned to breathe in the\nold world which is not however better than our new \"\u2014in the sitting of\nMay 1, 1907 (see Proceedings, Vol. XXII., p. 380).\n\fLXVIII.] Some Concordant Automatisms.\n\"\n39\nThe tables of the Law given to Moses on Mount Sinai were\n\" written with the finger of God \" {Exodus, xxxi. 18).\nIn the poem the Sign is the \" Star \" made \" out of three\nsounds.\" Mr. Piddington concluded later that Myersv had\nintended to point to this sign as symbolising the Latin Message.\nThe odd variant given in the script of the well-known line,\n-\n\" On the earth the broken arcs ; in the heaven a perfect round,\"\nhas also, I think, a special meaning ; but this, with the\nrough drawings that follow it, will be best discussed in con-\nnection with Mrs. Holland's script of March 20, 1907, given\nbelow, pp. 42-45.\nNext in chronological order comes :\nA green jerkin and hose and doublet where the song birds pipe\ntheir tune in the early morning\ntherapeutikos ek exotikon [a healer from aliens]\n{Miss Verrall's Script of Feb. 3, 1907.)\na monogram\nthe crescent moon\nremember\nlike a thunder riven oak the grim remains\nstand on the level desolation of the plains\na record for all ages of the span\nwhich nature gives to the weak labour of a man\nThe word \" pipe,\" with \" a healer from aliens \" is probably\nmeant as an allusion to the Pied Piper of Hamelin, especially\nas Miss Verrall's script of Feb. 17 (given below), which, like\n\f40 Alice Johnson. [part\nthis one, contains the word \" star \" and a drawing of a star,\nrefers unquestionably to that poem. \" Pipe \" is also in-\ntended, I have little doubt, as a punning reference to Mrs.\nPiper, indicating that the script contains a cross-correspondence\nwith hers.\nThere is a connection with Mrs. Verrall's script of Jan.\n28, 1907, in the (apparent) allusion to a poem by Browning,\nin the \" Star,\" and in the \" bird,\" for Mrs. Verrall had\nrecorded on Jan. 29 that she thought her script was an\nattempt at \" Bird,\" through the words \" wings \" and\n* :\nwinged,\" and Abt Vogler (\"Vogler\" = fowler).\nOn Feb. 11, 1907, MyersP stated that Hope, Star and\nBrowning had appeared in Mrs. Verrall's script. Later in\nthe day Mr. Piddington, studying Mrs. Verrall's scripts, con-\ncluded that those of Jan. 23 and 28 were referred to. He\ncommunicated this success to Mrs. Verrall, who, with a view\nto encouraging her daughter,1\ngave her on Feb. 15 a general\ndescription of the incident, substituting imaginary words for\nthe original ones. For \" Star,\" \" Planet Mars \" was sub-\nstituted, for \" Hope \" \" Virtue,\" and for \" Browning \"\n\" Keats.\" Nothing was said to Miss Verrall about the script\nof Jan. 23, but she was told that a five-letter anagram had\nconstituted part of the success on Jan. 28.

Mrs. Verrall's \" broken\nsounds\u2014threads \" and \" the perfect arc \" also point to chords\nin both senses of the word.\nBut, while the poem speaks of a \" perfect round,\" the\ntwo automatists\u2014both of whom are extremely familiar with\nthe poem\u2014refer, the one to a \" perfect chord \" and the other\nto a \" perfect arc.\"\nAs if to emphasise this misquotation or adaptation of the line,\nMrs. Verrall's script (see above, p. 36), gives two geometrical\ndrawings, the first showing a segment of a circle with its chord\nand its arc, and the second representing a complete circle,\nbelow which is added the remark :\n\" A D B is the part that unseen completes the arc.\"\nWith this compare the Holland script :\n\" \/ must wait before going on for the completion of the chord,\nor for the two remaining lives that are as stars in my constellation.\"\nAbt Vogler, the optimist with a passion for personal im-\nmortality, thinks only of the perfection to be attained in\nheaven. In the scripts we find Abt Vogler's conception\nenlarged by the thought that inspired F. W. H.

She tells me that he was a great admirer and\nconstant reader of Browning.

Consequently,\nwhen she produced her script of Mar. 20, 1907, she knew\nnothing of those earlier allusions, and therefore could have\nhad no normal reason for associating him with the script of\nDec. 19, 1906. Yet this latter and the script of Mar. 20,\n1907, seem closely linked together through their contributions\nto the cross-correspondence \" Hope, Star and Browning,\" and\nthrough their references to Prof. Maitland, while the phrase\n\" Memory dies without Love \" (March 20, 1907) is very similar\nto \" Qui bien ayme tard oublye \" (Dec. 19, 1906).\nThe four scripts here discussed are the only ones out of\nthe whole mass produced by Mrs. Holland and in my posses-\nsion which contain any mention of or allusion to Professor\nMaitland.\nThe following Table shows the dates at which the prin-\ncipal topics of this cross-correspondence occurred in the\nscripts of the various automatists.

F. Young (Second Edition; London, John Murray.\n1911; two vols.).

In February, 1469, when he was 19 years old, a splendid\ntournament was held at Florence, to celebrate his betrothal\nto Clarice Orsini. The dress worn by him on this occasion\nis represented in Benozzo Gozzoli's fresco of the Magi (part\nof which is reproduced in Plate VI.), where Lorenzo\u2014the\nthird and youngest of the Three Kings\u2014appears riding on\nthe great white horse which had been presented to him by the\nKing of Naples for the tournament. On the trappings of\nthis horse are the Medici arms, the seven balls, 1\n\u2014afterwards\nreduced to six. \" The device on his standard Avas a bay-\ntree, one half dry and dead-looking, and the other half green,\nwith the motto (worked in pearls) Le temps revient, symbolising\nthat a time of youth and joy, after the winter of [his grand-\nfather] Cosimo's old age and [his father] Piero's ill-health, was\nnow to supervene.\" 2\nAt this tournament Lorenzo was the\nvictor, and the bay-tree which forms a back-ground to his face\nin the fresco represents his device. A tall standard laurel is\nalso seen above his horse's head, and several other groups of\nlaurels are conspicuous in other parts of the picture.\nThe frescoes, painted for Piero il Gottoso on the walls\nof the chapel of the Medici (Riccardi) Palace by Benozzo\nGozzoli, are the only samples now remaining in the Palace\nof all the art treasures that it contained in the times of Cosimo,\nPiero and Lorenzo. The Journey of the Three Kings is made\na vehicle for references to the history of the Medici, and to\nall that they had done for Florence up to that time. Two\nchief episodes are referred to :\n(1) The Council of Florence in 1439, which had included\nJohn VII. (John Paleologus), the last but one Emperor of\nConstantinople, represented in the fresco as the second of\nthe Three Kings, and Joseph, the Patriarch of Constantinople,\n1\nThe reproduction is on too small a scale to show these details, %vhich are\nclear in photographs.\n2\nCol.

This Council had brought to\nFlorence the most learned men of the time, and so had furthered\nthe revival of the ancient learning which the Medici did so much\nto foster. And it was in consequence of the hospitality shown\nto them in 1439 that, when Constantinople was taken by the\nTurks in 1453, the Greek scholars who were driven out took\nrefuge in Florence.\n(2) The Tournament of 1469, in which the young heir\nof the family had distinguished himself. Lorenzo appears,\nas said above, as the Third King. Behind him is his grand-\nfather, Cosimo, riding a white horse, on whose trappings\nare the Medici arms, and his own private crest of the three\npeacock's feathers with the word Semper\u2014the motto of the\nfirst three Medici\u2014above them ; next to Cosimo is his brother\nLorenzo on a mule ; in the left corner Piero il Gottoso, and\nnext to him his younger son Giuliano, on a- white horse with\na jewel in its forehead.\nIn 1475 another famous tournament took place. Lorenzo,\nwho was now head of the family, used the same standard\nas at the previous one,\u2014the bay-tree which had appeared\ndead putting forth fresh leaves, with the motto Le temps\nrevient. On this occasion, his brother Giuliano was the victor,\nso that the tournament was known as La Giostra di Ghdiavo\n<Jp\" Medici, under which title a celebrated poem on it was\ncomposed by Politian. In this poem Politian, in allusion\nto the tournament's Queen of Beauty (the beautiful Simonetta\nCattaneo), describes the birth of Venus. And Botticelli's\nBirth of Venus follows closely the lines of Politian's poem,\nwhich is adapted from one of the Homeric hymns. In the\npicture (reproduced in Plate VII.) the laurel grove on the sea-\nshore, which spreads out over the nymph and partly over the\nhead of Venus, symbolises Lorenzo, who was called by Politian\n\" the Laurel who sheltered the song-birds that carolled to the\nTuscan spring,\" in allusion partly to his own poems and partly\nto his patronage of the poets of his time.\nPolitian on another occasion spoke of Lorenzo's great friend,\nPico della Mirandola, as \"the Phoenix who rested in the Laurel.\"\npartly, I suppose, as a pun on his name, \" the bird of wonder.\"\nWhen in 1512, the Medici family, who had been banished\nin 1494. were recalled to Florence, the rule of the city was\n\fLXVIII.] Some Concordant A u to mat isms. 53\nat first placed in the hands of Giuliano (Due de Nemours),\nthird son of Lorenzo the Magnificent, and afterwards in\nthose of Lorenzo (Duke of Urbino), son of Pietro the Unfor-\ntunate, who had died in exile, Cardinal Giovanni (afterwards\nLeo X.) and his cousin Giulio directing their policy. With a\nview to attaching the youthful nobles to their family, the Medici\nformed two Societies, one called the Company of the Diamond,\nwhich was headed by Giuliano, and the other called the Coni-\nparry of the Branch, which was headed by Lorenzo. These\nCompanies gave feasts and pageants, in imitation of those\nheld in former years at Florence. 1\nThe badge of the Diamond\nwas derived from certain crests of the elder Medici, and the\nBranch was that of the dry laurel putting forth new leaves,\nwhich was the tournament device of Lorenzo the Magnificent.\n(Of. Mrs. Verrall's script of Feb. 6, 1907, below, p. 61.) It is\nimportant to note that the Laurel was thus the emblem of\nthe younger as well as of the elder Lorenzo.\nIn 1524 the celebrated Medici Library, founded by Cosimo\nand largely added to by Piero and Lorenzo, was moved to\nthe building in which it is now located (in the cloisters of San\nLorenzo), which was designed and constructed by Michael\nAngelo. Hence it became known as the Library of San\nLorenzo, or the Laurentian Library. (Cf. Mrs. Verrall's script\nof Feb. 6, 1907.) It is described by Col. Young as \" the\nparent of all the great libraries of Europe.\" It is familiar to\nclassical scholars from its giving a name to well known MSS.,\nin particular the Laurentian MS. of Sophocles.\nThe Medici family were for the third time exiled from\nFlorence in 1527, immediately after the sack of Rome. Two\nyears later, the Imperial army marched on Florence, which\nsurrendered after being besieged for ten months ; and in\n1532, through the influence of Clement VII., Alessandro dc'\nMedici was made Duke of Florence.\nAlessandro, who passed for the son of the younger Lorenzo,\nwas actually the son of Clement VII., his mother being a\nmulatto slave. From his woolly hair, thick lips and generally\nnegro-like appearance (see his portrait by Bronzino, repro-\nduced in Plate VIII.), he was called II Moro (the Moor).

The live years of his rule represent the\ndarkest period of Florentine history. \" A historian of his\nown time calls him a '\ncreature who would have disgraced\neven the deadliest epochs of Roman villainy '; while another\ndescribes him as '\none whose excesses were as controllable\nby human reason as those of a beast of the forest.' \" 1\nOn the night of January 5, 1537, he was murdered by\nhis young relative Lorenzino, of the younger branch of the\nMedici family, in a room in the latter's house, adjoining the\nMedici Palace. Lorenzino then fled, and the Duke's body\nwas discovered next evening by his own servants. His death\nwas kept secret, and the body was hurriedly prepared for\nburial, \" and on the following night was carried by a few\nservants with great secrecy to the church of San Lorenzo,\nand without any religious service was hurriedly placed in\nthe sarcophagus containing the remains of Lorenzo (Duke of\nUrbino).\" 2\n(Cf.\nLk\nAlexander's tomb \" in Miss Verrall's script\nof March 17, 1907.)\nThe New Sacristy of San Lorenzo had been originally\nplanned by Leo X. while on a visit to Florence in 1516, with\nthe intention that it should contain six tombs,\u2014those of his\nfather Lorenzo and uncle Giuliano, and of the four members\nof the family who were then living, namely, himself, his\nbrother Giuliano, his cousin Giulio (afterwards Clement VII.),\nand his nephew, Lorenzo. Michael Angelo, to whom the\ncommission was entrusted, worked on it at intervals through\nvarious vicissitudes of fortune, including the siege of the\ncity, when he was in charge of the fortifications, up to the\nyear 1534, when on the death of his protector, Clement VII.,\nhe was obliged to flee from Florence, his life being in danger\nfrom the tyrant Alessandro. Only two of the tombs were\never completed, namely, those of the younger Lorenzo and\nthe younger Giuliano. The bodies of Lorenzo the Magnifi-\ncent and his brother Giuliano were originally buried in the\nsame tomb in the Old Sacristy of San Lorenzo. In 1559\ntheir bodies were removed to the New Sacristy and buried\nthere under the statues of St. Cosmo and St. Damian, the\npatron saints of their family ; but no monument was erected\n1\nCol.

The latter is the most famous of all the statues\nand the only one which has symbolic objects attached to it,\nnamely, the tragic mask, the owl, and the sack of poppy-\nheads on which the left foot of the figure is resting.\nThe faces of the two men, Twilight and Day, were left\nunfinished when Michael Angelo fled from Florence to escape\nthe vengeance of Alexander, who thus, besides being buried\nin one of the tombs, was partly responsible for the present\ncondition of both of them.\nThe figures were no doubt intended to symbolise the recent\nand contemporary history of Florence,\u2014the Day referring to\nthe golden times of Lorenzo the Magnificent, Michael Angelo's\nfirst patron, and the Twilight and Night the time of dark-\nness and tyranny under Alexander. The meaning of the\nstatue of Night is indicated in some verses written by Michael\nAngelo himself (in reply to some by Giovanni Battista Strozzi 2\n)\nand thus translated by J. A. Symonds :\n\" Sweet is my sleep, but more to be mere stone,\nSo long as ruin and dishonour reign ;\n1 Mrs. Browning, Oasa Guidi Windows.\n2\nLa Notte che tu vedi in si dolce atti\nDormir, fu da un Angelo scolpita\nIn questo sasso, e perche dorme, ha vita :\nDestala, se nol credi, e parleratti.\n\f56 Alice Johnson.

The phrases in the first ones are, it will be\nseen, of a vague and general character. But they seem to\nbe continuous with and to lead up to the later more explicit\npassages, and it is on this ground that I interpret them as\nalluding to the Medici Tombs.\n(Mrs. Holland's Script of Nov. 9, 1906.)\nThe shadow is very clear and black and appears almost as\nweighty as the substance\n\u2014\n\" The best of this kind are but shadows \" 2\nShadoAv-shapes\u2014 Did Margaret trace the connection back in\nher analytical mind. . . .\n1\nThe original verses are as follows\n:\n\" Grato m'e '1 sormo, e piu l esser di sasso,\nMentre che il danno e la vergogna dura\n;\nNon veder, non sentir, m'e gran ventura\n;\nPero non mi destar, deh ! parla basso !\n\"\n2 Midsummer Night a Dream, Act V., Scene 1.\n\fLXVIII.] Some \" Concordant Automatisms.\" 57\nThe \" shadow \" here seems to be the first emergence of the\n\u2022'\nLight and Shadow\u2014Shadow and Light \" of Mrs. Holland's\nscript of March 27, 1907, below, which I take, for reasons there\ngiven, to refer to the statues of Day and Night on the Medici\ntombs. Cf. \"shadow \" in Holland scripts of Nov. 28 and Dec. L 2,\n1906, below, which seem to continue the topic of this script.\n\" Margaret \" is no doubt Mrs. Verrall, Avho is frequently\nso referred to in Mrs. Holland's script ; the occurrence of\nthe name here and in the next script seems to indicate that\na cross-correspondence with Mrs. Verrall is intended.\n{Mrs. Holland's Script of Nov. 13, 1900.)\nThere is no place for doubt or any fear\n\u2014\n\" In a voice that she will know\nMargaret \" 1\nNo\u2014no\u2014not Percy\u2014 John\n\u2014\nA wreathed garland of deserved bays 2\n[sic]\nSince life had grown more pale than Death\n\u2014\nWaking more husht than Sleep\n\u2014\nThe second son\n\u2014\n\" There is no place for doubt or any fear \" is perhaps con-\nnected with the implicit reference to \" human fears \" in the\nfirst line of the script of Nov. 21, 1906, below.\nIn this script, again, as in that just quoted, we have the\nname \" Margaret.\"\n\" A wreathed garland of deserved bays \" is the first emer-\ngence of the important topic Laurel Wreath, which connects\nwith the Medici, as explained above ; it is to be noted that,\nas in many other cases, the most important word is emphasised\nby a misquotation,\u2014the substitution of \" bays \" for \" praise.\"\n\" Since Life had grown more pale than Death\nWaking more husht than Sleep\u2014 \"\nThese lines (which are, I think, original) seem to combine\nSymonds' and Wordsworth's versions of Michael Angelo's\nverses, quoted above ;\nor, in any case, to refer to the statues\non the Medici tombs.\n1\nMatthew Arnold, The Forsaken Merman.\n2 \" A wreathed garland of deserved praise,\nOf praise deserved, unto Thee I give.\"\n(George Herbert, A Wreath.)\n\f58 Alice Johnson.

These three words, here\nitalicised, are the only ones that are underlined in the whole\nof the original script. The important topic Dawn is further\nemphasised by the pun on it, which serves the double pur-\npose of drawing attention to the word and indicating, through\nthe allusion to Mrs. Piper's early \" control,\" Phinuit, that\nshe is to bear a share in the cross-correspondence.\n1 \" A slumber did my spirit seal,\n1 had no human fears ;\nShe seem'd a thing that could not feel\nThe touch of earthly years.\nNo motion has she now, no force ;\nShe neither hears nor sees ;\nRoll'd round in earth's diurnal course,\nWith rocks, and stones, and trees.\"\n(Wordsworth, A slumber did my spirit seal.)\n2\nTo this Mrs. Holland added a contemporary note :\n\" On reading it over,\nthe last sentence suggests Mrs. Piper's '\nDr. Phinuit.'\n\"\n\fLXVIII.] Some \" Concordant Automatisms.'\" 59\n(Mrs. Holland's Script of Dec. 12, 1906.)\nThe shadow and the sleep\u2014 The Dream and the Awakening. . . .\nI take the first of these phrases to refer to the statue of\nthe sleeping Night and the second to that of the Dawn, who\nis generally described as awaking from troubled dreams.\n{Mrs. Verrall's Script of Dec. 24, 1906.)\n* Let there be light he said and there was light 1\nAnd the evening and the morning were the first day.*\nThe reference has been given before but I think not understood.\nlargas luminis oras [Shores full of light.]\nThe western fight that flooded all the room\nSic vos non vobis. ahena utitur voce non sua\nEgo feci \u2014j\n\u2014\nquern Rectoreru Directorem cognoscis.\n[So you not for you.

The quotations in this script (except the\nfirst) are, I think, intended to suggest the Night and Day,\nand Evening and Morning of the Tombs.\n1 \" The violet in her greenwood bower,\nWhere birchen boughs with hazels mingle.\"\n(Scott, The Violet.)\n\f08 Alice Johnson. [part\nThe context of the second quotation is as follows :\n\" The night lay deep on Rose Mary's heart,\nFor her swoon was death's kind counterpart\n;\nThe dawn broke dim on Rose Mary's soul,\n\u2014\nNo hill-crown's heavenly aureole,\nBut a wild gleam on a shaken shoal.\nShe knew she had waded bosom-deep\nAlong death's bank in the sedge of sleep :\nAll else was lost to her clouded mind ;\nNor, looking back, could she see defin'd\nO'er the dim dumb waste what lay behind.\"\n(D. G. Rossetti, Rose Mary, Part III.)\nThis description is very similar to those in the earlier scripts\njust mentioned, and is appropriate to the figures of the two\nwomen, Night and Dawn, of the Tombs.\nThe verse in the script beginning : One star in the crimson\nWest is, I believe, original, though the third line is probably a\nreminiscence of \" And the weary Day turned to his rest\n\"\nin Shelley's poem, To Night. It is appropriate to the man's\nfigure, Twilight, and also gives the word, Day, which is the\nname of the other man.\nThe last quotation in the script is :\n\" My God, how many times ere I be dead\nMust I the bitterness of dying know ?\n\"\nThese are the opening lines of the second of a pair of sonnets\nby F. W. H. Myers, entitled respectively, \" Would God it\nwere Evening,\" and \" Would God it were Morning \" {The\nRenewal of Youth and other Poems, pp. 82-83). This, then,\ngives us again, by implication, Evening and Morning.\nIt is to be noted that the melancholy and despondent tone\nof all these literary allusions is highly appropriate to the\nsubject of the Tombs.\n{Miss VerralVs Script of March 17, 1907.)\nAlexander's tomb quinque et viginti annos post urbem conditam\n[five-and-twenty years after the founding of the city]\nwith fire and sword to purge the altar, not without grief.\n\fLXVIII.] Some \" Concordant Automatisms.\" 69\nlaurel leaves are emblem\nlaurel for the victor's brow.\nSay not the struggle nought availeth 1\nSesame and lilies arum lilies\nwhen the darkens [sic] on the quiet land\nscarlet tulips all in a row\n\" Alexander's tomb.\" The combination of this script with\nthe following one by Mrs. Holland makes it in my view certain\nthat the tomb meant is not\u2014as we all supposed at the time\n\u2014that of Alexander the Great, but that of Alessandro de'\nMedici, described above, p. 54.\nThe Latin sentence following the words \" Alexander s tomb\n\"\nhas definite meaning in connection with another topic not\ndealt wdth in this paper.\n\" Laurel leaves are emblem\u2014Laurel for' the victor's brow.\"\nThis is especially appropriate to the bay-tree that had appeared\ndead putting forth fresh leaves which, as stated above, was\nthe device on the standard of Lorenzo the Magnificent at the\ntournament of 1469, and Lorenzo was the victor in that\ntournament.\n{Mrs. Holland's Script of March 27, 1907.)\nBirds in the high Hall Garden 2\u2014\nNot Maud Sylvia\n\u2014\nThe poor right hand is so dreadfully tired at the wrist not in the\nball of the thumb\n\u2014\n[The following, as far as \" right way up,\" is in mirror-writing, and\nas far as \" toto dum \" is written with the left hand.]\nTake the left hand\u2014only it is not your right hand that is tired.\nPeter is the second one\n\u2014\nBut M.

And these ideas are em-\nphasised by their repetition in the later passage of the script,\nwhich contains the words \" darkness,\" \" Light and Shadow\u2014\nShadow and Light.\" I take these words to refer to the statues\nof Day and Night on the second Medici tomb.\n1\nOthello, Act I., Scene 3.\n2\nOthello, Act V., Scene 2.\n;!\nFor Mr. Piddington's original comments on this script, see Proc., Vol.\nXXII., pp. 225-227, and 261-202.\nThe tall mast, but this one is not at sea.\n\flxviii.J Some \" Concordant Automatisms.\" 71\n\" Alexander Moors Head.\" This, combined with Mrs.\nPiper's \"Moorhead\" (Feb. 26, 1907) and Miss Verrall's\n\" Alexander's tomb \" (March 17, 1907) seems to prove that\nthe person meant is Alexander de' Medici, who, as stated\nabove, p. 53, from his woolly hair, thick lips and negro-like\nappearance, was known as \" The Moor.\" The quotations from\nOthello which follow indicate that \" Alexander Moors Head \"\nwas the same kind of Moor as Othello, that is, not a real Moor,\nbut a negro, the negroes, as well as other Africans, being\ncommonly called Moors 1\nat that time. Othello is described\nin the play once as \" The thick-lips \" and several times as\n\" black \" or \" sooty \" ; and the portraits of Alexander de'\nMedici (see Plate VIII.) show his strongly marked negro\ntraits.\nThe drawings of masts at the end of the script led me at\nfirst to interpret \" Alexander Moors Head \" as Dr. Alexander\nMuirhead, for I took the masts to represent wireless telegraphy\napparatus, and knew that Mrs. Holland had taken some\ninterest in the subject of wireless telegraphy (though she\nknew nothmg of it scientifically) in connection with Sir Oliver\nLodge. There had, in fact, been a punning reference to the\nLodge-Muirhead system in her script of May 15, 1906, besides\nan earlier reference in her script of January 17, 1904, which\nwas discussed under the heading \" The Diamond Island\nIncident \" in Proc, Vol. XXV., p. 293. The significance of\nthis misinterpretation is discussed in the final section of this\npaper, see below, pp. 153-154.\nThe next script to be quoted was produced a considerable\ntime after the one last given. But as Mr. Piddington's report\nwas not published until October 19, 1908, and the automatists\nhere concerned were strangers to all of us, they could not have\nknown anything about the scripts or the cross-correspondences\ndiscussed in that report. An account of the experiments\nof these automatists, whom we call the \" Mac \" family, was\ngiven in Mrs. Verrall's paper on \"A New Group of Experi-\nmenters,\" in Proceedings, Vol. XXIV., pp. 264-318, and certain\ncross-correspondences between their script and Mrs. Holland's\nwere given in my \" Third Report on Mrs. Holland's Script,\"\nin Proceedings, Vol. XXV., pp. 222, 234-236, and 193-198.\n1\nHence the word blackamoor.\n\f72 Alice Johnson. [part\nThe only point that concerns us here is the following extract\nfrom a script by Miss E. and Mr. A. Mac :\n\u2014\n(Mac Script, Oct. 7, 1908.)\nDig a grave among the laurels\nThe drawing is obviously intended for a laurel wreath, and\nthe combination of the \"grave\" with \"the laurels,\" together\nwith the fact that the script contains an allusion to Sesame\nand Lilies (see Proc, Vol. XXIV., pp.- 291-292), and so con-\nnects with Miss Verrall's of March 17, 1907, shows, I think,\nthat the Medici tombs are meant.\nThe next script to be quoted was again produced after a\nlong interval ; but the fact that Mrs. Willett's script during\nthe early part of 1910 contained a number of cross-correspond-\nences with the earlier scripts of other automatists, as related\nin my Third Report on Mrs. Holland's script (Proc, Vol. XXV.,\npp. 218-293)adds considerably to the probability that the connec-\ntion in this case also was supernormal, and not accidental.\nAt the time of producing this script, Mrs. Willett had seen\nthe reports on the scripts which had been already published\n(i.e. up to Proc, Part LX. inclusive) but she did not know\nthat there had been any allusions to the Medici tombs, these\nnot having been made out until two years after she wrote.\n(Mrs. Willett's Script of June 10, 1910.)\n....

Be it mine, then, to plunge among the unknown Destinies,\nto dare and still to dare !\n\" (F. W. H. Myers.)\nSummary of Chapter.\nIt may be useful to prefix to this long and complicated sec-\ntion a general account of the course of events, though it must\nbe understood that the force of the coincidences cannot be\ngiven in a summary, nor can they be estimated without a\ndetailed study.\nThe episode is initiated by a remark made to Mrs. Verrall\nat a Piper sitting which reminds her of an early script of hers\nabout calm on high summits above storm. She then deter-\nmines to ask Myersp what are his associations with the words\nauras ovpavo? uku\/jluiv (a phrase from Plotinus, meaning \" The\nHeaven itself waveless,\" prefixed to a poem on Tennyson by\nMyers, and taken from a Plotinian passage describing trance\nor ecstasy, which is quoted in Human Personality).\nOn the day after the question was put, MyersP gives (on\nJan. 30, 1907) what appears to be a paraphrase of a line in\nthe poem and an apparent reference to In Memoriam.\nMrs. Verrall's script (Feb. 12) refers to several of Tenny-\nson's poems : Voyage of Maeldune, Merlin and The Gleam, (?),\nPassing of Arthur, and Lucretius. These references relate\nnot to Calm only\u2014like the Greek phrase\u2014but to storm and\nadventure, expressing the contrast between the Active and\nContemplative life which seems to be the essential topic of\nthis section. The poems quoted from are familiar to Mrs.\nVerrall ;\nbut, as Mr. Piddington five years later notices, two\nquotations which the script combines are derived from two\ndifferent passages in the Odyssey, which two passages he finds\nto be combined, as in the script, in the Dissertationes of the\n\f78 Alice Johnson. [part\nNeo-Platonist Maximus of Tyre, a book unknown to Mrs.\nVerrall, but known to F. W. H. Myers.\nMrs. Verrall's next script (Feb. 20), which refers again to\nPeace and to Adventure, contains what I take to be an allusion\nto Myers's poem The Renewal of Youth, which is definitely\nalluded to again in her script of March 11 and in Mrs. Piper's\nof March 13.\nOn Feb. 25, Miss Verrall's script gives expression to the\nActive ideal, through a quotation from Browning's Epilogue ;\nand on the same day Mrs. Verrall insists on the need for \" the\nhelp of all who labour in this cause \" (meaning, no doubt,\nthe co-operation of several automatists) to bridge the space\nbetween world and world.\nNext day Mrs. Verrall hears of her daughter's quotation\nfrom Browning on the day before, and her script proceeds\nto enlarge on the contrast between Tennyson, \" the seer who\nknew \" and Browning, \" the fighter.\"\nThis is the only script of Mrs. Verrall's belonging to this\nsection, or to the subsidiary section of \" The Clavigers\n\"\n(Chapter VI., below), in which any reference to Browning\noccurs, whereas every one of her scripts of this section (except\nthose of Feb. 20 and Mar. 4\u2014the latter a \" Claviger \" script)\ncontains quotations from or allusions to poems by Tennyson.\nSimilarly, Mrs. Piper, who\u2014it is to be noted\u2014did not\nknow that the avro? ovpavos uKvfxon> question had anything\nto do with Tennyson, makes no reference to Browning, but\nalludes in four different sittings to In Memoriam, and in\nthree to Crossing the Bar, the latter being the particular poem\nalluded to in Myers's poem on Tennyson.\nOn the other hand, Miss Verrall's single contribution to the\nsubject consists in a quotation from Browning.\nMrs. Holland, again, in this section and in the subsidiary\nsection of \" The Clavigers \" makes important contributions\nto the subject through significant quotations from three\ndifferent poems by Browning, whereas her only reference to\nTennyson (apart from possible reminiscences of Crossing the\nBar and In Memoriam on March 13 and April 8), consists in\nthree words combined with one of her Browning quotations\n(on April 8).\nTo return to the chronological order of events,\u2014Mrs.\n\flxviii.] Some \" Concordant Automatisms.\" 79\nVerrall on Feb. 26 quotes from Crossing the Bar, and refers\nto Elijah on Mount Horeb and Moses on Mount Sinai, which\nlatter she takes afterwards to imply a verse in In Memoriam.\nOn March 6 she quotes from In Memoriam verses about\nCalm.\nOn the same day Mrs. Piper refers to In Memoriam (\" Arthur\nHallam \"), and gives the same quotation from \u2022 Crossing the\nBar that Mrs. Verrall had given on Feb. 26.\nOn March 11 Mrs. Verrall refers to passages about Plato\nin two poems by Myers,\n\u2014\nStanzas on Mr. Watts' Collected\nWorks and The Renewal of Youth, connecting these with \" a\nverse in Tennyson.\" These and previous scripts lead her\nto a careful study of In Memoriam, from which she concludes\nthat Tennyson, like Plotinus, specially associated the calm\nof external nature with the condition of ecstasy, and that\nthis was why F. W. H. Myers had chosen the words from\nPlotinus as a motto to his poem on Tennyson.\nThe close parallelism between Tennyson's description and\nthat of Plotinus in this respect had not hitherto been noted\nby writers on Tennyson ; it seemed, then, that knowledge not\npossessed by Mrs. Verrall had emerged in her script.\nOn March 13, MyersP states (correctly) that he has given\nMrs. Verrall a message about Crossing the Bar, and refers\nto In Memoriam (\" Arthur Hallam \") again. He also refers\nto a description of death in The Reneival of Youth.\nOn the same day, Mrs. Holland quotes lines about death\nfrom another poem of Myers's in the same volume ; with other\nreferences to different ways of dying, and the phrase \" A very\nstill and tideless sea.\"\nOn March 18, Mrs. Holland again describes different ways of\ndying.\nOn April 8, she again speaks of the calm of external nature\nin the words :\n\" Peace on the great heart of the heaving sea\nAnd on the rocks that fringe the ocean, peace.\"\nIn connection with a contrast of the Active and Contemplative\n(\" Leah and Rachel \") she gives a composite quotation from\nBrowning and Tennyson, and apparently alludes to Moses\nwith a quotation from Browning analogous to the Tennysonian\n\fso Alice Johnson. [part\nquotation associated with Moses in Mrs. Verrall's script of\nFeb. 26.\nOn April 8, Mrs. Holland's script also speaks of an after-\nglow in the East ; Mrs. Verrall's says \" Rosy is the East,\"\nand in Mrs. Piper's waking-stage the phrase \" Light in West \"\nis uttered.\nIn the same waking-stage Mrs. Piper speaks of \" Francis \"\nand \" Roland Les Val.\" This seems to be explained on April\n29 by the mention of Francis of Assisi, whose experiences in\nhis retreat on La Verna, given to him by Roland, is shown to\nbe closely parallel to the experiences of Moses on Mount Sinai.\nOn April 29 MyersP in connection with the Greek words\nalso mentions other great visionaries\u2014Swedenborg, St. Paul,\nand (?) Dante and, on April 30, Socrates,\u2014apparently with\nspecial reference to the vision premonitory of his death.\nOn May 1 Mrs. Verrall's script repeats some of the topics\npreviously given in it. Finally, on May 6, 1907, MyersP states\nthat Plotinus is his \" answer \" to the Greek words.\nDetailed Report. 1\nThis is one of three cases belonging to this period in which a\ntest-question put to Mrs. Piper's trance-personalities seemed\nto be the starting-point of one or more cross-correspondences.\nIn one case\u2014the \" Latin Message,\" summarised above\n\u2014\nthe especial aim of the question was to elicit evidence of\nthe action of an intelligence independent of the minds of\nall the living persons concerned,\u2014whether automatists or\ninvestigators.\nIn the other two cases\n\u2014\" Horace Ode \" and \" avros ovpavo?\nanu\/j-wv\n\"\u2014the question was planned by Mrs. Verrall with a\nspecial view to obtaining evidence of the identity of the\nintelligence communicating through Mrs. Piper whom we call\nMyersp.\nIt followed from the circumstances of these experiments\nthat the different automatists were not all in the same position\nwith regard to them, as they are in spontaneous cases of\ncross-correspondence.\n(a) Mrs. Verrall knew that the three experiments were\n1\nThe first report of this ease was given by Mr. Piddington in Proa, Vol.\nXXII., pp. 107-171.\n\flxvhi.] Some \" Concordant Automatisms.\" 81\nbeing tried, and allusions to all of them naturally appeared\nin her scripts. In the case of the Latin Message, her know-\nledge of the experiment could not, of course, help her in any\nway to produce the evidence desired. But in the case of\nher own two questions, she knew something about what\nanswers would be appropriate. More knowledge of the\ntopics, however, seemed to be shown in her scripts than was\nnormally possessed by her. Further, cross-correspondences\nbetween her scripts and those of the other automatists\noccurred.\n(b) To Mrs. Piper the three questions were put while she\nwas in trance, and they were, of course, never mentioned to\nher when she was in any other condition. One question was\nput to her in Latin ; another related to the meaning of a\nGreek phrase (avTos ovpavo? atajficov) ; and the third, the\nHorace Ode question (\" Which Ode of Horace entered into\nyour [i.e. F. W. H. Myers's] inner life ? \") was one which\nit was impossible that Mrs. Piper could have answered from\nher own normal resources.\n(c) Miss Verrall had some knowledge of the Latin Message\nexperiment (see above, p. 26), but none of the other two.\n(cl) Mrs. Holland (in India) was in complete ignorance of\nall the experiments.\nThe \" Horace Ode question \" was put by Mr. Piddington\nto Myersp for the first time on January 23, 1907. Passages\nrelating to it were found hi the scripts of Mrs. Piper and of\nMrs. Verrall only,1\nand have been fully described and dis-\ncussed by Mr. Piddington in Proc, Vol. XXII., pp. 397-407 ;\nVol. XXIV., pp. 150-169 ; and Vol. XXVI., pp. 174-220 ;\nalso by Mr. G. W. Balfour in Vol. XXVI., pp. 221-230.\nThe gist of these passages was to suggest a contrast between\nthe despairing view of man's destiny after death taken in\nthe Horace Ode and in some of F. W. H. Myers's early poems,\nand the hopeful view of his later poems ; the contrast being\nexpressed through cross-correspondences between the scripts\nof Mrs. Piper and of Mrs. Verrall.\nExperiments of a kind somewhat similar to these had\nbeen tried in earlier days with Mrs. Piper by Dr. Hodgson\n1\nThere is also a possible reference in Mrs. Holland's script of March 20,\n1907, see above, p. 43.\nF\n\f82 Alice Johnson. [part\nand other investigators ; that is, they had tried to obtain\nevidence of the identity of alleged communicators by asking\nquestions on scientific or literary topics, the answers to which\nwould presumably be known to the communicators, but\nwould be considerably beyond Mrs. Piper's normal knowledge.\nNo very satisfactory results had been obtained.\nThe present experiments were not only more successful\nthan previous ones in the amount of literary knowledge\nshown by Myersp,1\nbut a new and very important element\nwas added in that parts of the answers to the questions were\ngiven through other automatists besides Mrs. Piper, one at\nleast of whom\u2014Mrs. Holland\u2014knew nothing of the questions.\nThis result was not expected by the experimenters, and,\nindeed, the whole upshot was far more complicated than\nthey had expected, the various topics overlapping one another\nand mingling together in the scripts in a way difficult to\ndisentangle. These topics have been classified as far as\npossible to help the reader to follow them ; but he should\nbear in mind throughout that several subjects were being\ntreated of contemporaneously in all the scripts and that some\nof them turned out to be curiously interconnected.\nThe Horace Ode topic has already been dealt with ex-\nhaustively in the Proceedings, and need not here be referred\nto again. But the discovery of allusions in Mrs. Holland's\nscript to the avros ovpavo? ukv\/xwv topics entailed a further\nstudy of all the scripts concerned with them, in the course\nof which other discoveries were made. The scripts are there-\nfore given again here.\nThe avroi ovpavos cucv\/ulmv Question.\nThe question was devised by Mrs. Verrall under the follow-\ning circumstances :\nAt a sitting with Mrs. Piper on Jan. 15. 1907, 2\nMrs. Verrall\nand Mr. Piddington being present, MyersP said that he had\ngiven Mrs. Verrall the message :\n\" Celestial Halcyon days.\"\n1\nStill more interesting results in this line were obtained later by Mr. Dorr\nin his sittings with Mrs. Piper, March to May. 1908. See Proc, Vol. XXIV.,\npp. 31-200.\n2\nSee Proc, Vol. XXII., p. 104.\n\flxviii.] Some \" Concordant Automatisms.\" 83\nMrs. Verrall did not remember that any such phrase had\noccurred in her script, but on Jan. 22, while on her way to\nanother sitting with Mrs. Piper, she wrote the following :\n(Mrs. VerraU's Script of Jan. 22, 1907.)\nA thousand years shall roll\nA thousand aeons pass\nEre the imprisoned soul\nShall see as in a glass\nDarkly,1\na vision dim\nFlit, phantomlike and fair,\nA breath, a fairies' whim\nThro' the encircling air.\nClasp not the half-seen shade\nAs once Anchises' son,\nLet the faint vision fade\nTill all thy race be run\nThen in the broader light\nThat floods the world super N\nClear to the sharpened sight\nHold fast the One Eterne !\nMrs. Verrall thought that the main point of this script lay\nin the word \" Supern,\" and on the following day she remem-\nbered that the word \" supernal \" had occurred in her script\nof July 3, 1903,2\nwhich was as follows :\nFor her a message of peace\u2014contemplation on high summits\n\u2014\nstillness in the air. . . .\nThe storm and Avhirlwmd consume the blue clear space between\nthe worlds, but the supernal peace is undisturbed.\nThe last sentence seems to represent the fundamental idea\nof \" halcyon days,\"\u2014an interval of calm between storms.\nBut the main point of the script seems to be that while halcyon\ndays in this world are transitory, in the celestial world they\nare unending. Thus, as MyersP claimed, the idea of, though\nnot the phrase, \" celestial halcyon days,\" would seem to have\n1\nCf. \" For now we see through a glass, darkly ; but then face to face\n\"\n(1 Cor. xiii. 12).\n2\nQuoted in full in Proc.

[part\nappeared in Mrs. Verrall's script, though this might never\nhave been observed but for the occurrence of the word\n\" Supern \" in her script of Jan. 22, 1907. After her sitting\nwith Mrs. Piper on that day, Mrs. Verrall tried to think of\nsome question to put to MyersP , with a view to testing if he\nhad access to the memories of F. W. H. Myers,\u2014the question\nof course to be one which it would seem impossible that Mrs.\nPiper should answer from her own normal resources.\nMrs. Verrall thought that some Greek quotation would be\na good subject for the test-question, and on the evening of\nJan. 23, 1907, it suddenly occurred to her that the words\nKai avros ovpavbs clkv\/uloov would serve the purpose. 1\nThese words, followed by the name of the author, Plotinus,\nbut by no further reference, and with no translation, occur\nonce in Myers's published works, namely, as the motto to a\npoem \" To Tennyson \" in Fragments of Prose and Poetry,\np. 117. They may be translated as :\n\" And the very Heaven\nwaveless.\" They are taken from a passage in Plotinus'\nEnneades, V. 2-3, which was translated as follows by F. W. H.\nMyers in Human Personality, Vol. II., p. 291 :\nThe Vision which dissolves for a moment the corporeal prison-\nhouse ;\n\" the flight of the One to the One.\"\n\" So let the soul that is not unworthy of that Vision contem-\nplate the Great Soul ; freed from deceit and every witchery, and\ncollected into calm. Calmed be the body for her in that hour, and\nthe tumult of the flesh ;\nay, all that is about her, calm ;\ncalm be\nthe earth, the sea, the air, and let Heaven itself be still. Then let\nher feel how into that silent heaven the Great Soul floweth in. . . .\nAnd so may man's soul be sure of Vision, when suddenly she is\nfilled with light ; for this light is from Him and is He ; and then\nsurely shall one know His presence when, like a god of old time,\nHe entered into the house of one that calleth Him, and maketh it\nfull of light.\"\nIt seems clear that Mrs. Verrall's script of Jan. 22, 1907.\nwas largely based on a subliminal recollection of this passage.\nMrs. Verrall, having informed no one of her proposed experi-\nment, determined to put the question to MyersP at her next\n1\nThis decision, with the reasons for it, was recorded in Mrs. Verrall's diary\nof Jan. 24, 1907, quoted in full in Pror., Vol. XXIT., pp. 140-141.\n\flxviii.] Some \" Concordant Automatisms.\" 85\nsitting with Mrs. Piper, on Jan. 29, 1907.

Cf.\n\" purple and sea-blue \" in Mrs. Holland's script of April 8,\n1907, below, p. 112.\nUlysses \" may be a reference to Tennyson's poem\n\" Ulysses,\" which is closely associated with In Memoriam,\nas Tennyson himself said of it :\n\" Ulysses was written soon after Arthur Hallam's death and\ngave my feeling about the need of going forward and braving the\nstruggle of life perhaps more simply than anything in In\nMemoriam.\" 2\n1\nMrs. Verrall did not, of course, make any comment on these words at\nthe sitting.\n- Tennyson : A Memoir, Vol. I., p. 19G.\n\f88 Alice Johnson. [part\nThe fact that, as Mrs. Sidgwick tells me, Tennyson's Ulysses\nhad been mentioned to Mrs. Piper's trance-personalities by\nDr. Hodgson at one or more of his sittings with her proves that\nthey knew there was such a poem, and so adds to the proba-\nbility that Myersp was referring to it when he said \" Ulysses.\"\nAfter this sitting of Jan. 30, 1907, Mrs. Verrall had no\nfurther intercourse with Mrs. Piper of any kind until the\nsitting of April 29, 1907 (see below, p. 110). One of her\nown scripts is the next to be quoted :\n{Mrs. VerralVs Script of Feb. 12, 1907.)\nThe voyage of Maeldune faery lands forlorn and noises of the\nwestern sea.\nthundering noises of the western sea.\nIt is about Merlin and Arthur's realm Merlin's prophetic\nvision\n\u2014\n'\nall night long\nmid thundering noises of the western sea\n'\nand how he would not go\u2014the passing of Arthur.\nAnd then the island valley of Avilion\nwhere blows not any wind none nor ever falls the least light\n\u2014\nno not that but you have the sense\nthere falls no rain nor snow nor any breath of wind shakes the\nleast leaf.\nI will try to get the idea elsewhere conveyed\u2014but it is hard\nand I know I have failed before.\nWhy will you not put the signature %\nSurely you know now that it is not you.\nF.W.H.M.\n\" The voyage of Maeldune \" probably refers to Tennyson's\npoem of that name. The voyage of Maeldune, who was a\nsort of Irish Ulysses, was in the western sea, \" the great\nocean that has no ending,\" 1\nand the islands he met with\nmight well be described as \" faery lands forlorn,\" which is a\nphrase from Keats's Ode to a Nightingale :\n\" The same [song] that oft-times hath\nCharm'd magic casements, opening on the foam\nOf perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.\"\n1\nLady Gregory, A Book of Saints and Wonders, \" The Voyage of Maeldune.\"\n\flxviii.] Some \" Concordant Automatisms.\" 89\nIt is also the title of a poem by F. W. H. Myers (see Frag-\nments of Prose and Poetry, p. 142) containing the phrases :\n\" that heaven-high vault serene \" and \" unearthly calms,\"\nand suggestive in general of the lines from In Memoriam (XI.),\n\" And in my heart, if calm at all,\nIf any calm, a calm despair,\"\nwhich are quoted in Mrs. Verrall's script of March 6, 1907,\nsee below, p. 97.\n\" Noises of the western sea \" and the similar phrases follow-\ning it are no doubt reminiscences of\n\"So all day long the noise of battle roll'd\nAmong the mountains by the winter sea ;\n\"\nand\n\" Where the moving isles of winter shock\nBy night, with noises of the northern sea.\"\n(Tennyson, Morte d''Arthur and The Passing\nof Arthur.)\nMerlin's 'prophetic vision was interpreted by Mrs. Verrall\non March 15, 1907, as a reference to Tennyson's poem, Merlin\nand The Gleam, read by her then for the first time. In the\nPreface to the Memoir of Tennyson, this poem is explained\nas his literary autobiography, and the lines :\n\" Arthur had vanish'd\nI knew not whither,\nThe king who loved me\nAnd cannot die ;\n\"\nas a joint reference to King Arthur and Arthur Hallam.\nThe first version of The Passing of Arthur was Morte\nd''Arthur, and the first draft of this was written shortly after\nArthur Hallam's death, between Sections XXX. and XXXI.\nof In Memoriam.1\nIt is of course obvious to any student of\nTennyson that the conception he formed of King Arthur\nwas closely bound up in his own mind with his conception of\nArthur Hallam ; but this special connection between the\ntwo poems was unknown to Mrs. Verrall till she read the\nMemoir of Tennyson for the first time on May 18, 1907.\n1\nSee Tennyson : A Memoir, Vol. I., p. 109.\n\f90 Alice Johnson. [part\nThe next part of the script alludes to part of Arthur's fare-\nwell to Sir Bedivere :\n^ I am going a long way . . .\nTo the island-valley of Avilion ;\nWhere falls not hail, or rain, or any snow,\nNor ever wind blows loudly.\"\nBut in Oet., 1910, Mr. Piddington noticed 1\nthat the words\nin the script \" Nor ever falls the least light \" are taken from\nthe following passage from Tennyson's Lucretius :\n\" The Gods, who haunt\nThe lucid interspace of world and world,\nWhere never creeps a cloud or moves a wind,\nNor ever falls the least white star of snow,\nNor ever lowest roll of thunder moans,\nNor sound of human sorrow mounts to mar\nTheir sacred everlasting calm ! and such,\nNot all so fine, nor so divine a calm,\nNot such, nor all unlike it, man may gain\nLetting his own life go.\"\n(\" The lucid interspace of world and world \" is cpioted in\nMrs. Verrall's scripts of Feb. 25, 1907, and May 1, 1907, given\nbelow, pp. 93 and 124.)\nThe first of these Tennysonian passages is based, as Mr. Pid-\ndington observes, on Odyssey, IV. 566-568, and the second on\nOdyssey, VI. 43-45, so that a reference to the two Odyssey\npassages is combined in a single passage of the script. The\ncombination may be attributed to subliminal memory, since\nMrs. Verrall is familiar with the two passages in the Odyssey,\nand with the two Tennysonian passages. Mr. Piddington,\nhowever, discovered the same combination of the two Odyssey\npassages in a single sentence of the Dissertationes (XVII. 10-11)\nof the Neo-Platonic philosopher, Maximus of Tyre, in a passage\ndescribing the conditions whereby a man while still embodied\nmay attain to the vision of God. (Gf. Mrs. Holland's script\nof April 16, 1907, \"To fly to find Euripides,\" and comments\non it, below, pp. 139-142.) Mrs. Verrall had never read\nthe Dissertationes, but a passage in F. W. H.

The word\n\" clear-obscure \" also occurs in The Renewal of Youth (p. 223)\nin a passage relating to Tintoretto's pictures.\nMr. Piddington has shown (Proc, Vol. XXVI., p. 212)\n1 \" The light that never was, on sea or land.\"\n(Wordsworth, Peele Castle in a Storm.)\n\f!>2 Alice Johnson. [part\nthat much of this script points to Myers's poem Venice and\nrelates to the Horace Ode question.

Believe me, Sir, had I such venture forth. ...\"\nThe phrases selected out of this passage by the script\npoint again to the Adventurer, already referred to in the\nscript of Feb. 12, 1907 (\" The voyage of Maeldune \") and so\nto the contrast of Active and Contemplative that will be\nseen later to form an essential factor in this cross-cor-\nrespondence.\nNext comes a short script by Miss Verrall, who was then\nat Cambridge, but knew nothing of her mother's experiment,\nor of her scripts.\n{Miss Verrall's Script of Feb. 25, 1907. 5.30 p.m.)\nMany ties that bind\nin the silence of the sleep time.1\nAbout an hour later, Mrs. Verrall, not having seen her\ndaughter's script, produced the following :\n{Mrs. Verrall's Script of Feb. 25, 1907. 6.45 p.m.)\nNot each but all United stand \u2014a firm knit band \u2014but,\nsingle, fall.\n2\n1\n\"At the midnight in the silence of the sleep-time,\nWhen you set your fancies free,\nWill they pass to where\u2014by death, fools think, imprisoned\n\u2014\nLow he lies who once so loved you, whom you loved so ?\n\"\n(Browning, Asolando :\n\" Epilogue.\")\n2\nMrs. Verrall knew that the phrase \" United we stand, divided we fall\n\"\nhad occurred in Mr. Piddington's sitting with Mrs. Piper on Jan. 2, 1907,\nbeing apparently a reference by MyersP to the Latin Message.\n\fLXVIII.] Some \" Concordant Automatisms.\" 93\nTest the weakest link but even that stands firm\nI stretch my hand across the vaporous space, the interlunar\nspace 1\u2014'twixt moon and earth,\u2014where the gods of Lucretius quaff\ntheir nectar.\nDo you not understand ?\nThe lucid interspace of world and world\nWell that is bridged by the thought of a friend, bridged before\nfor your passage, but today for the passage of any that will walk\nit, not in hope but in faith.\nThe bridge has been built from our side, it is our thought that\nbuilds it-\u2014but it rests on a pier of your founding,\u2014not yours\u2014of\nyou only,\u2014of all of yours\nNon tua opera, sed omnibus adiuvantibus qui in ista causa\nlaborant\n[not by thy help, but with the assistance of all who labour in\nthis cause.]\nnot tua [thy] but but vestra [your] he means\nR\nbut he does not talk our language.\n\" Where the gods of Lucretius quaff their nectar.\" The\npassage from Tennyson's Lucretius alluded to in this script\nis quoted in full above, p. 90, in connection with the. script\nof Feb. 12, 1907.

This,\nthough not the last poem composed by him, 2\nis almost certainly\nwhat the script means by \" the last poem of Tennyson,\" and it\nmay fitly be so called, since he gave special directions that it\nshould be placed at the end of all complete editions of his\nworks.\nIt is obvious from the other references in the script that\n1\nTennyson, Crossing the Bar.

In this\npoem he tells his friends that he wishes them to think of him\nafter his death as holding to the same ideals of activity and\nprogress that he had during life, when he\n\" Never turned his back but marched breast forward, . . .\nHeld we fall to rise, are baffled to fight better,\nSleep to wake.\"\nSo, he urges them, when death comes\n\" In the bustle of man's work-time\nGreet the unseen with a cheer !\nBid him forward, breast and back as either should be,\n'\nStrive and thrive !\n'\ncry '\nSpeed,\u2014fight on, fare ever\nThere as here !\n'\n\"\nBut the phraseology of the script,\n\u2014\" The fighter fights\none last fight, but there is peace for him too in the end,\"\n\u2014\nis derived more directly from Browning's Prospice :\n\" I was ever a fighter, so\u2014one fight more,\nThe best and the last !\n\"\n\" And the elements' rage, the fiend-voices that rave,\nShall dwindle, shall blend,\nShall change, shall become first a peace out of pain. ...\"\nThis reminiscence leads on not unnaturally to the \" still\nsmall voice \" heard by Elijah on Mount Horeb after the\nwind, the earthquake, and the fire (I. Kings, xix. 9-13).\nMrs. Verrall herself, however, did not consciously recognise\nthe allusion to Elijah at all, but interpreted this part of the\nscript at the time as referring to Moses on Mount Sinai, when\n\" there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud upon\nthe mount and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud. . . .\nAnd mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the\nLord descended upon it in fire : and the smoke thereof\n\f96 Alice Johnson. [part\nascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount\nquaked greatly. And when the voice of the trumpet sounded\nlong and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake and God\nanswered him by a voice \" (Exodus, xix. 16-19).\nLater, when Mrs. Verrall concluded that the essential part\nof the answer to her question on avros ovpavos olkv\/j-wv was\nto be found in the description of trance in In Memoriam,\nXCV. (see below, p. 101), it seemed to her that the supposed\nallusion to Moses was the first emergence in her script of\nIn Memoriam, the last verse of Section XCVI. being :\n\" But in the darkness and the cloud,\nAs over Sinai's peaks of old,\nWhile Israel made their gods of gold,\nAltho' the trumpet blew so loud.\"\nThis view was recorded by Mrs. Verrall on June 25, 1907.\nMy interpretation of Mrs. Holland's script of April 8, 1907\n(see below, p. 113), as alluding to Moses, was made some\nyears later, and on entirely independent grounds.\nNow it is clear that the wording of Mrs. Verrall's script\n\u2014\n\" after the earthquake and the fire and the wind, in the still-\nness comes the voice that can be heard \"\u2014is derived from\nthe story of Elijah rather than from that of Moses. But the\ninterpretation that she herself places on her script at the\ntime must be regarded as one of the factors in the total mental\nimpression, which is partially\u2014but probably never more\nthan partially\u2014expressed in the script. It must, then, be\nheld that the script refers to both Moses and Elijah. This\nis extremely natural, considering the great similarity between\nthe two stories ; and considering also that Moses and Elijah\nwere associated together in the Transfiguration, which also\ntook place on a \" high mountain,\" apart from the multitude,\nand when also a voice from heaven was heard out of a cloud.1\nAll these associations were, of course, familiar to Mrs.\nVerrall, though she did not consciously think of them at the\ntime. But there is another close connection between the\nOld Testament histories of Moses and Elijah, of which both\nshe and Mr. Piddington, as well as myself, happened to be\nignorant, viz. that Mount Horeb and Mount Sinai are two\n1\nMatt. xvii. 1-5.\n\flxviii.] Some \" Concordant Automatisms.\" 97\ndifferent names used in different parts of the Bible for the\nsame mountain.\nLi\nIt has been shown by Dillmann that the\nElohist and Deuteronomy always use the name Horeb for the\nsame mountain which the Jahvist and the Priestly Code call\nSinai \" (Encyclopaedia Britannica : Article \" Sinai \"). This is\nby most authorities identified with the mountain now called\nSt. Catherine, the name being derived from the great monastery\nof St. Catherine, the most famous of the monasteries built in\nearly Christian times in the Sinaitic peninsula.

In that script special stress is laid on the\ndistinction between the shadow and the reality represented by\nit ; and the \" verse in Tennyson \" here mentioned is probably\nIn Mernoriam, XCIII., especially :\n\" No visual shade of some one lost,\nBut he, the Spirit himself, may come\nWhere all the nerve of sense is numb ;\nSpirit to Spirit, Ghost to Ghost.\nDescend, and touch, and enter ; hear\nThe wish too strong for words to name ;\nThat in this blindness of the frame\nMy Ghost may feel that thine is near.\"\n1\nPlato, who, according to one tradition, was born at ^Egina.\n2 \" Stanzas on Mr. Watts' Collected Works \" (The Renewal of Youth and\nother Poems, pp. 117-118).\na\nThe Renewal of Youth, p. 212. \u2022\n\fLXVIII.] Some \" Concordant Automatisms.\" 101\n\" Presences on the eternal hills, etc.\" These phrases seem\nto be reminiscences of two Wordsworthian passages :\n\" The silence that is in the starry sky,\nThe sleep that is among the lonely hills.\"\n(Song at the Feast of Brougham Castle.)\n\" For images of other worlds are there ;\nAwful the light, and holy is the air.\nFitfully, and in flashes, through his soul,\nLike sun-lit tempests, troubled transports roll ;\nHis bosom heaves, his Spirit towers amain,\nBeyond the senses and then little reign.\nAnd oft when that dread vision hath past by,\nHe holds with God himself communion high,\nThere where the peal of swelling torrents hits\nThe sky-roofed temple of the eternal hills.\"\n(Descriptive Sketches taken during a Pedestrian\nTour among the Alps.)\nHere we have a continuation of the topic of visions in\nthe solitude of mountain heights, like those of Moses and\nElijah in Mrs. Verrall's script of Feb. 26, 1907, above.\nThe references in her script to Tennyson, with the intro-\nduction of In Memoriarn, and in particular the combination\nof Plato and Tennyson as both aware of \" unseen companion-\nships \" in the script of March 11, 1907, led Mrs. Verrall to\nbelieve that there must be a more definite connexion between\nIn Memoriarn and the passage from Plotinus than she had\nhitherto recognised. She therefore re-read the poem carefully\nin the light of her script, and was struck by the resemblance\nin language as well as in thought between Sections XCIV.-\nXCV., which describe the poet's trance and its antecedent\nconditions, and the passage in Enneades V. (quoted above,\np. 84) where Plotinus describes the antecedent conditions\nrequired for ecstasy,\u2014Tennyson, like Plotinus demanding a\ncondition of calm in the external world, as well as in the\nindividual soul. 1\nThis discovery seemed to Mrs. Verrall partly at least to\n1\nAn article on this subject was, at Professor A.

Myers had chosen the motto auros\novpavog ukvijlwv for his poem on Tennyson, in which he wrote :\n\" Once more he rises ; lulled and still,\nHushed to his time the tideways roll\n;\nThese waveless heights of evening thrill\nWith voyage of the summoned soul.\"\nMrs. Verrall had of course realised that this referred to\nTennyson's Grossing the Bar\u2014his desire that there might\n\" be no moaning of the bar \" when he \" put out to sea \"\n\u2014\nand to the fulfilment of this desire at the time of his death.\nBut (as Mr. Piddington observed *) \" a much deeper significance\nattaches to the choice of the motto when it is recognised that\nTennyson himself, like Plotinus, desired conditions of external\npeace before attaining in life the trance condition, in which\nhe felt as though he had communion with the unseen world.\"\nThere is no suggestion, either in Myers's poem or elsewhere in\nhis writings, that he associated the Plotinian passage with\nTennyson because of its resemblance to Sections XCIV.-\nXCV. of In Memoriam, so that the script purporting to be\ninspired by him gave a new and cogent explanation which\ncould not be derived from his own published works.\nMrs. Verrall recorded the conclusions she had come to on\nthese points in her diary of March 12, 1907 (which is quoted\nat length in Proc, Vol. XXII., pp. 145-146), and on the fol-\nlowing day brought a summary of this entry with full explana-\ntions and references to London, and gave it to me in a closed\nenvelope to be given to Mr. Piddington after his sitting with\nMrs. Piper on the morning of that day.\n{Extract front record of sitting with Mrs. Piper on March 13, 1907.)\n(Present, Mr. Piddington.)\n(Myers communicating.)\nI referred to\n1\nProc, Vol. XXII., p. 123.\n\flxviii.'I Some \" Concordant Automatisms.\" 103\nJ.

(p. 08), for reasons there given, as alluding\nto the figures of Day and Night, and Morning and Evening\non the Medici Tombs. But I believe that, just as a single\nphrase in a script may combine two distinct literary allusions,\nso it may refer jointly to two items in a cross-correspondence\nor to two different cross-correspondences, and I think that\nthis is the case with these verses. The topic of East and\nWest given in them is resumed in Mrs. Holland's script of\nApril 8, 1907 (see below, p. 110), which in several other\nrespects, as will be seen, is closely connected with this script.\n\" How many times ere I be dead\nMust I the bitterness of dying know ?\n\"\nis, as already said, taken from the second of a pair of sonnets\nby F.

This line by itself would account\nonly for \" sea-blue \" ; but in the Memoir of Tennyson (Vol.\nII., p. 4), Tennyson, writing to the Duke of Argyll on this\nverse, remarks :\nAs to \" sea-blue birds \" etc., defendant states that he was walk-\nng one day in March by a deep-banked brook, and under the\n\flxviii.] Some \" Concordant Automatisms.\" 113\nleafless bushes he saw the king-fisher flitting or fleeting under-\nneath him, and there came into his head a fragment of an old\nGreek lyric poet \" aXnropfyvpos eiapos opvis,\" \" The sea-purple or\nsea-shining bird of Spring,\" spoken of as the halcyon.\nDuring the first week in January, 1907, Mrs. Holland had,\nas she told me in a letter dated Jan. 10th, been reading the\nMemoir of Tennyson, and out of the fifteen scripts (including\nthe one under consideration) written since she read it, three\nbesides this one contain passages that are clearly to be traced\nto it. It therefore seems to me practically certain that her\nmisquotation, \" purple and sea-blue,\" is derived from Tenny-\nson's letter just quoted.\nThis view is confirmed by the passage in the earlier part\nof the same script, \" Peace on the great heart of the heaving\nsea,\" which would aptly describe the \" halcyon days \" of\nspring, when the kingfisher is supposed to build its nest on\nthe sea.\nWe have here then a contribution to the central topic of\nthe cross-correspondence, and, in view of Mrs. Verrall's remark,\n\" The last poems of Tennyson and Browning should be com-\npared \" (see her script of Feb. 20, 1907, above, p. 94), it is\nnoteworthy that it is given in the form of a composite Brown-\ning-Tennyson quotation.\n\" He the strong smiter\u2014the earth compeller.\" I take this\nto be a reference to the two most famous miracles of Moses :\n(1)\n\" And the Lord said unto Moses, C4o on befoi'e the\npeople, and take with thee of the elders of Israel ; and thy\nrod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand,\nand go. Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock\nin Horeb ; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall\ncome water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses\ndid so \" (Exodus, xvii. 5, 6).\nIn the version in Numbers (xx. 11) the smiting is further\nemphasised :\n\" Moses lifted up his hand and with his rod\nhe smote the rock twice : and the water came out abundantly.\"\n(2) When at the word of Moses \" the ground clave asunder\nthat was under [Korah, Dathan and Abiram].

Tliey, and all that appertained to them,\nwent down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon\nthem : and they perished from among the congregation\n\"\n(Numbers, xvi. 31-33).\nI base this interpretation not merely on the appropriateness\nof the script phrases to these incidents, but chiefly on a special\nassociation between the Leah and Rachel of the script and\nMoses in the cross-correspondence, \" The Clavigers,\" given\nbelow, pp. 135-137.\n\" A billoxoy cloud heavy with, blessing.\" Cf.\n\" Hush ! if you saw some western cloud\nAll billowy-bosomed, over-bowed\nBy many benedictions\u2014sun's\nAnd moon's and evening star's at once\n\u2014\nAnd so, you, looking and loving best,\nConscious grew, your passion drew\nCloud, sunset, moonrise, star-shine too\nDown on you, near and yet more near,\nTill flesh must fade, for heaven was here !\n\"\n(Browning, The Last Bide Together.)\nThis verse is, I think, the origin of the phrasing of the\nscript. But the words are, I believe, intended to be applied\nto the \" thick cloud \" upon Mount Sinai, which is so con-\nstantly referred to in the Mosaic narrative,1\ne.g. :\n\" And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the\nmount. And the glory of the Lord abode upon mount Sinai, and\nthe cloud covered it six days : and the seventh day he called unto\nMoses out of the midst of the cloud. And the sight of the glory\nof the Lord was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in\nthe eyes of the children of Israel. And Moses went into the midst\nof the cloud and gat him up into the mount : and Moses was in\nthe mount forty days and forty nights \" (Exodus, xxiv. 15-18).\nIf this script refers, as I believe it does, to Moses, it is note-\nworthy that while Mrs. Verrall's script alludes only to the\n1\nAnother \" cloud \" associated with Moses, which might more aptly be\ndescribed as \" heavy with blessing,\" was the \" pillar of cloud \" which was\nthe sign of divine protection and guidance to the Israelites throughout their\nwanderings in the wilderness (Exodus, xiii. 21, etc.).\n\flxviii.] Some \" Concordant Automatisms.\" 115\ncontemplative side\u2014to his communion with God on Mount\nSinai\u2014and connects this with a verse from Tennyson (In\nMemoriam), Mrs. Holland's supplements it by laying stress\non the active side of his life,\n\u2014\" He the strong smiter\u2014the\nearth compeller,\"\u2014and then goes on to point, as I think,\nto the communion on Mount Sinai through a quotation from\nBrowning, the whole being in harmony with the idea of the\ncombination of the Active and Contemplative expressed in\nthe preceding part of the script.\n(Extract from report of sitting of Mrs. Piper on April S, 1007.)\n(Present, Mrs. Sidgwick only.)\nE.

Whether\nor not there is any justification for the apparent statement\nthat \" Rector \" represents St. Francis, the reference to Francis\nin the sitting gives a meaning to the remark in the waking\nstage, \" See about Roland\u2014Les- Val ;\n\" for I conjecture that\n\" Les Val \" is an attempt at La Verna (otherwise called Alverna\nor Alvernia), the mountain given to St. Francis by the Tuscan\nnoble, Roland of Chiusi di Casentino, where he received the\nstigmata. The experiences of St. Francis on the Mount of\nLa Verna were, as explained in detail below, closely analogous\nto those of Moses on Mount Sinai. It is therefore noteworthy\nthat he should be mentioned in a Piper sitting on the same\nday that Mrs. Holland's script contained phrases which were\ninterpreted on other grounds as allusions to Moses.\n{Extract from record of sitting with Mis.

It was not unnatural, therefore,\nthat some confusion ensued from her not always understanding\n\fLXVIII.J Some \" Concordant Automatisms' 119\nto what topic MyersP was alluding. Thus the \" picture\n\"\nmentioned by him as connected with \" the Greek words\n\"\nwas almost certainly the drawings of the ' !\nBar \" in the sitting\nof March 13, 1907 (see above, p. 102) ; whereas when Mrs.\nVerrall replied that she had had \" some references to a picture,\"\nshe meant Raphael's picture, which was one of the subjects of\nthe cross-correspondence \" Ave Roma \" (see above, p. 12).\nMyerSp seems at first confused between the \" Horace Ode\n\"\nquestion and the \" Greek words \" question (both having been\nput to him originally by Mrs. Verrall), but almost immedi-\nately realises that they are distinct, and spontaneously connects\nwith the latter \" Sasia Saisia Francis S i a a.\" There can,\nI think, be little doubt that by this St. Francis of Assisi is\nmeant. He then goes on\u2014apparently in the same connection\n\u2014to refer to Swedenborg, St. Paul and \" a blue sea \" (which\nmust imply a cloudless sky) ; and to a word beginning with\nD., which Mrs. Verrall suggests is Dante. In the waking\nstage he mentions \" the unknown deity,\"\u2014probably in refer-\nence to St. Paul's sermon at Athens {Acts, xvii. 23),\u2014and\nrepeats the name \" Arthur Hallam.\"\nSwedenborg and St. Paul are spoken of in Human Person-\nality, Vol. II., p. 261, as among \" the strong souls who have\nclaimed to feel [the transcendental ecstasy],\" together with\nElijah, Plotinus, Dante, Wordsworth and Tennyson (among\nothers), all of whom have been referred to in the course of\nthis cross-correspondence. It is therefore appropriate that\nMyerSp should mention them here.\nSt. Francis of Assisi, who, as we have seen, was probably\nthe Francis mentioned in the Piper sitting of April 8, 1907,\nis of special interest in this connection on account of the\nclose parallelism between what must be regarded as the crown-\ning event of his life\u2014the retreat on the Mount of La Verna\nduring which he received the stigmata\u2014and the experiences\nof Moses on Mount Sinai, 1\nreferred to in the scripts of Mrs.\nVerrall and Mrs. Holland. The parallelism is referred to in\ngeneral terms by more than one of his early biographers, but\n1\nIt is of course probable that the Franciscan Legend was moulded to\nsome extent on the Mosaic Legend, and that this accounts\u2014at least in part\u2014\nfor the resemblances between them. My argument relates only to the resem\nblances, and is not affected by any question as to what caused them.\n\f120 Alice Johnson. [part\nhas not, so far as I know, been worked out in detail. It may\ntherefore be worth while to give it more fully here.\nThe Mount of La Verna (otherwise called Alverna) in Tus-\ncany was given to St. Francis 1\nby a Tuscan noble, Roland of\nChiusi di Casentino, as a place where he and his friars might\nfound a solitary retreat. (See \" Roland\u2014Les Val \" in the\nPiper sitting of April 8, 1907.) He went there with Friars\nMasseo, Angelo and Leo, accompanied by a peasant on whose\nass St. Francis rode. On their way up the mountain, the\npeasant suffered greatly from thirst, and St. Francis by virtue\nof his prayers caused a spring to gush out of a hard rock\nwhere water had never been seen before or since ; as Moses\nbrought water out of the rock in Horeb ( = Sinai).\nAfter they reached the place chosen for the friary, St.\nFrancis stayed there for a short time with the other friars.\nLater he sought for a more solitary and more secret place,\nin which to keep the fast of St. Michael, and a little cell was\nmade for him on the further side of a great chasm. Friar\nLeo alone came with him to this retreat, but remained always\nat a distance from him except when at certain hours he came\nto bring him food. In this solitary place St. Francis spent\nthe forty days of the fast. Similarly, Moses was accompanied\nfor some way up Mount Sinai by Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and\nseventy elders ; and went on further alone with his minister\nJoshua, and remained in the mount forty days and forty\nnights {Exodus, xxiv.).\nOne night in the early part of September, Friar Leo, going\nto take food to St. Francis, saw him praying in the wood.\nThen he saw a flaming torch 2\ncome down from heaven and\nrest on the head of St. Francis, and out of the flame he heard\na voice speaking in words which he could not understand,\nbut afterwards St. Francis told him, \" God was in that flame\nthou sawest, who spake to me in that vision, even as of old\nHe had spoken to Moses.\"\nOn the morning of Holy Cross Day (Sept. 14, 1224), before\n1\nThe account of St. Francis here given is taken from The Little Flowers\nof St. Francis, trans, by T. Okey.\n2\nCf. the Pentecostal \" cloven tongues like as of fire \" (Acts, ii. 3), associated,\ne.g. in Keble's Whitsunday hymn, with the manifestations to Moses on Mount\nSinai.\n\flxviii.] Some \" Concordant Automatisms.'' 121\ndawn, St. Francis, praying, saw the vision of the Seraph\nand received the stigmata. Then the whole mount of La\nVerna seemed for about an hour to flame forth with so brilliant\na light that it was reported by some shepherds to the friars.\nAlso some muleteers, thinking the sun had risen, arose and\nsaddled their beasts. Then they saw that light wane and\nthe real sun rise.\nCf. \" The sight of the glory of the Lord [upon Mount Sinai]\nwas like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes\nof the children of Israel \" {Exodus, xxiv. 17).\nSt. Francis, having completed in solitude the forty days'\nfast of St. Michael, \" descended from the mountain, bearing\nwith him the likeness of the Crucified, engraven, not on tables\nof stone or of wood by the craftsman's hand, but written on\nhis members of flesh by the finger of the Living God.\" 1\nCf.\n\" He gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing\nwith him upon Mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables\nof stone, written with the finger of God \" {Exodus, xxxi. 18) ;\nand \" And the tables were the work of God, and the writing\nwas the writing of God, graven upon the tables \" {Exodus,\nxxxii. 1G).\nSt. Francis is also compared by St. Bonaventura to Elijah :\n\" [He was] wholly set on fire by the kindling of the Seraph,\nand, like the prophet, borne aloft in a chariot of fire ; where-\nfore it is reasonably proven and clearly apparent from the\nwitness of his whole life that he came in the spirit and power\nof Elias.\" 2\nWe find too that his ecstasy, like that of Plotinus, was\n(according to St. Bonaventura) associated with the calm of\nexternal nature : \"In the neighbourhood of the aforesaid\nMount Alverna, before that the holy man had sojourned\nthere, a cloud was wont to arise from the mountain and a\nfierce hailstorm to lay waste the fruits of the earth. But\nafter that blessed vision, to the amazement of the inhabitants,\nthe hail ceased, that the excellence of that heavenly appari-\ntion and the virtue of the stigmata that were there imprinted\nmight be attested by the very face of the heavens, made\ncalm beyond its wont.\"\n1\nLife of St. Francis, by St. Bonaventura (trans, by Miss E.

[part\nAs to the script of March 4, 1907, the Hercules Furens\nof Euripides was one of the plays included in Dr. Verrall's\nstudies of Euripides, but neither he nor Mrs. Verrall was able\nto conjecture what particular point in the story had, as alleged\nby the script, been missed by him, nor has any further light\nbeen thrown on this since.\nThe latter part of the script lays stress on the contrast\nbetween the Bound and the Unbound Heracles. In the play\nthe tying of Heracles to the pillar, after, in his madness, he\nhad killed his wife and children, is an important incident,\nbut there is no particular point in the untying after he recovers\nhis reason. \" Bound and Unbound,\" however, naturally\nsuggests Prometheus, as is further indicated by the phrase\n\" adamantine fetters \" (borrowed from the Prometheus Vinctus\nof iEschylus)\u2014fetters from which he was delivered by Heracles.\nI take it, then, that the general intention of this script is to\npoint to the contrast of Binding and Loosing,\u2014a topic which\nis carried on and developed in the script of March 25, 1907.\nThis script by its opening reference to the Claviger\u2014the\nbearer of the Key and Club\u2014refers back to Mrs. Verrall's\nscript of March 5, 1906 (see above, p. 20), in which the\nClaviger had been interpreted by Mrs. Verrall herself as a\njoint allusion to Hercules and St. Peter. It may then be taken\nas certain that this script too refers to St. Peter as well as to\nHercules.\nBut Mr. Piddington 1\npointed out that the only Latin writer\nwho uses \" Claviger \" in the sense of\n' L\nKey-bearer \" is Ovid,\nwho in Fasti, I. applies the term to the two-headed Roman\ndeity Janus. Janus holds in his right hand a staff and in\nhis left a key ; he is the door-keeper of the courts of heaven,\nand with his double face is able to see the East and the West\nat the same time. In the same book of the Fasti Ovid calls\nHeracles \" Claviger,\" viz. \" Club-bearer.\"\nThe epithet Claviger, then, suggests three different charac-\nters, Heracles, Janus, and St. Peter. Heracles is partly\nEastern, partly Western, and his Club is one of the signs of\nthe Oriental elements in his mythology. Janus is a purely\n1\nI here summarise the comments on this script made by Mr. Piddington\nin Proc, Vol. XXII., pp. 253-258 ; but the reader who is interested in the\nclassical allusions should refer to that report for full details.\n\fLXVHI.] Some \" Concordant Automatisms.\" 131\nWestern deity, but the Key with which he opens and shuts,\nand his power of seeing the East and West simultaneously\nare instances of various antithetical powers attributed to him.\nTo St. Peter, an Oriental and first bishop of the Western\nChurch, belongs the Power of the Keys, which admit into\nor exclude from the Kingdom of Heaven, and the power of\nbinding and loosing. 1\nFurther, St. Peter, according to one tradition, was mar-\ntyred on the Janiculum, the hill of Janus ; while Ovid has a\nstory that Heracles was the first to throw dummy figures\ninstead of live human beings from the Sublician Bridge into\nthe Tiber as sacrifices to Vulcan, this being the oldest bridge\nacross the Tiber, and leading straight to the Janiculum.\nThe words \" trans pontem trans Hellespontem \" seem to\ninvolve a play on pontem and (Helles) pontum which can\nallude only to Xerxes ; for it was he who built the pontem\n(bridge) between Abyclos and Sestos by means of which the\nPersian army crossed Helles pontum {i.e. the sea of Helle. or\nthe Hellespont) to Greece. The point of this allusion is probably\nas another instance of the union of East and West.\n\" The city formerly Byzantine, afterwards called by his own\nname \" is of course Constantinople, to which Constantine\nremoved the seat of the Roman Empire after he became sole\nruler of the East and West portions of it. The Asian part\nof the Empire naturally became more closely bound up with\nthe West through this action of Constantine 's.\nThe latter part of the script, beginning : \"I want a special\nmessage to get to you . . .\n\", is the part that is connected with\nthe avros ovpavos aKUfiwv incident, being no doubt founded,\nat least partly, as Mrs. Verrall herself observed, on a quota-\ntion from Plotinus in Human Personality (Vol. II., p. 290, on\nthe page preceding that from which the Plotinian passage\nquoted above, p. 84, is taken) as follows :\nWhen from that cloud encompassing of unforgetful souls some\nvoice is heard,\u2014as long ago,\u2014there needs no heroism, no sanctity,\nto inspire the apostle's kiriOvfua eZs to dvaXva-ai, the desire to\n1 \" I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven : and whatso-\never thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven : and whatsoever\nthou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven \" (St. Matthew, xvi. 19).\nCf.

[part\nlift our anchor and to sail out beyond the bar. ... \"As the\nsoul hasteneth,\" says Plotinus, \" to the things that are above, she\n.will ever forget the more ; unless all her life on earth leave a\nmemory of things done well. For even here may man do well, if\nhe stand clear of the cares of earth. And he must stand clear of\ntheir memories too ; so that one may rightly speak of a noble soul\nas forgetting those things that arc behind. And the shade (if\nHerakles, indeed, may talk of his own valour to the shades ; but\nthe true Herakles in the true world will deem all that of little worth ;\nbeing transported into a more sacred place, and strenuously engag-\ning, even above his strength, in those battles in which the wise\nengage.\"\nIn this passage Plotinus is alluding to Odyssey, XL 601-3,\nwhere a distinction is drawn between the shade (e'lSwXov) of\nHeracles in Hades and Heracles himself (auras') in Heaven.\nMr. Piddington points out that the same lines in the Odyssey\nmust have been the source of Tennyson's\n\" No visual shade of some one lost\nBut he. the Spirit himself, may come. ...\"\n(In Memoriam, XCIII.)\n(This stanza has already been quoted in commenting on\nthe reference to Tennyson and Plato in Mrs. Verralks script\nof March 11. 1907, see above, p. 100.)\nThe same words, e'lSajXov 1\nand auras , are used in the same\nsense in Plato's allegory of the prisoners in the cave, which\nis referred to in the script of March 25, 1907.\nThe meaning of all the latter part of the script seems to be\nthat the images seen in trance or ecstasy are in themselves\nunreal, but that they represent a reality :\n\u2014\" like the shadows\nin Plato's cave, bat they are shadows of the reed.\"\nSan Pietro in Vincoli.\nSince the script of March 25, 1907, was taken by Mrs.\nVerrall to refer to St. Peter as well as to Hercules, I think\nthere can be little doubt that the \" binding and loosing\n\"\nand \" snapping his bonds in sunder \" of March 4, 1907, also\n1\nIt is interesting that the word \" eidolon \" was used in some early scripts\nof Mrs. Holland's, commented on in my first report, Proc, Vol. XXI.,\npp. 215-218. The note on it supplied to me by Mrs. Verrall and\" there\nprinted was not written until March, 1908.\n\fLXVIII.] Some \" Concordant Automatisms.\" 133\nrefer to St. Peter as well as to Hercules, the two scripts being\nso closely connected together. The phrase \" binding and\nloosing \" refers, I take it, to the powers attributed to the\nApostle, which were in some respects analogous to those\nattributed to Hercules (e.g. in the hitter's delivery of Pro-\nmetheus from his bonds). \" Something about snapping his\nbonds in sunder \" refers, I think, to the chains with which\nSt. Peter himself was bound in prison.\nTwo imprisonments of St. Peter 1\nare recorded : (1) when he\nwas imprisoned by Herod in Jerusalem and delivered by an\nangel, when \" his chains fell off from his hands \" and the iron\ngate \" opened to them of his own accord \" (Acts, xii. 1-10) ;\n(2) when, as asserted by some early ecclesiastical writers, he\nwas confined with St. Paul in the Mamertine prison at Rome\nfor eight or nine months up to the time of his martyrdom.\nThe church of San Pietro in Vincoli in Rome, to which 1\nbelieve that special reference is made in these scripts and in\na corresponding one of Mrs. Holland's, contains as its chief\nrelic the chains alleged to be those with which St. Peter was\nbound in the Mamertine prison.\nThere are a number of different legends as to the acquisi-\ntion of these chains by the church. According to one version,\nthey were sent originally to Jerusalem, and afterwards pre-\nsented by the Bishop of Jerusalem to Eudoxia, who put one\nin the Basilica at Constantinople and sent the other to her\ndaughter, the Empress Eudoxia at Rome. The latter built\nthe church as a shrine for the chain. Shortly afterwards the\nsecond chain was sent to Rome and miraculously united itself\nto the first.\n2\nThe miracle was beheld in a vision by Pope\nLeo I.\n3\n; the day on which it occurred, August 1st, being\nalways afterwards kept as a festival when the sacred chain\nis exhibited.\nIn the sacristy, where the shrine containing the chain is\nkept, is a picture by Domenichino of the freeing of St. Peter\nfrom prison, and a copy of the same picture is in the church\nitself.\n1\nBesides the occasion when he and St. John were \" put in hold \" for a\nsingle night at Jerusalem (Acts, iv. 3.)\n2\nRom und die Campagna, by Dr. Th. Gesell Fels, p. 80fi.\n3\nSee Hare's Walks in Rome, Vol. II., p. 50.\n\f134 Alice Johnson. [part\nTins church, then, may be said to represent, as perhaps no\nother church does, St. Peter Bound and Unbound, both in\nthe East and in the West ; which latter feature, together\nwith the union of the Roman chain with that from Con-\nstantinople, is another instance of the combination of West\nand East which we have seen to be one of the factors of the\nwhole complex cross-correspondence.\nSt. Sebastian.\n\" \/ told you before of Sebastian, it is the same story of the\narcher and the binding to the pillar.\"\nSt. Sebastian is of course often represented in art as bound\nto a pillar (like Hercules in the Hercules Furens) and generally\nas pierced with arrows. The pillar and the arrows suggest\nan association with Hercules ; but I believe that the main\nintention of the script is again to point to the church of San\nPietro in Vincoli. One of the chief features of this church\nis a remarkable old mosaic of St. Sebastian, described by Dr.\nGsell Eels as a unique example of the Byzantine influence\nin Rome,1\nand reproduced in the illustration given below\n(Plate XI).\nA fresco in the church ascribed to Pollajuolo represents\nthe translation of the body of St. Sebastian, as Depidsor\nPestilitatis, from the catacombs to the church. This occurred\nduring the plague of 680, when a citizen dreamt that it would\ncease as soon as the body of St. Sebastian was brought into\nthe church and an altar erected to him. A tablet near the\naltar tells the story of the plague and its cessation.\nFrom this time onwards St. Sebastian was invoked as a\nprotector against the plague, and his fame gradually spread\nthrough the whole of Europe.2\nMrs. Verrall was in Rome once only, in March, 1892, as\nrelated above in connection with the \" Ave Roma immortalis\n\"\ncross-correspondence (see p. 21), and a note in her diary\nrecords that she visited S. Pietro in Vincoli on March 30,\n1892. When, in the autumn of 1912, I mentioned to her\n1\nRom und die Campagna, p. 810.\n2\nSee Hare's Walks in Rome, Vol. II., p. 52 ; and Mrs. Arthur Bell's Lives\nand Legends of the Evangelists, Apostles and other early Saints, p. 239\n\flxviii.] Some \" Concordant Automatisms.\" 135\nthat the Church contained a famous mosaic of St. Sebastian,\nshe remembered nothing about it. But when later I showed\nher a photograph of it, she wrote :\nOn reflection I am sure that we must have seen the St. Sebastian\nmosaic. The photograph of it brought it back to me vividly,\nand we were very much interested in mosaics and went to all the\nchurches where there were any interesting mosaics. What I did\nnot and do not recall is that this mosaic was in the church of San\nPietro hi Vincoli.\n(Mrs. Holland's Script of April 8, 1907.)\nIs the Paradiso mental relaxation ?

The most famous literary\nexpression of this idea of Leah and Rachel occurs in Dante's\nPurgatorio, and the mention of the Paradiso earlier in the\nscript shows that the scribe had Dante in mind. Rachel is\nmentioned several times in the Commedia, but Leah occurs once\n\f136 Alice Johnson. [part\nonly, and then with Rachel, in the following passage (Purga-\ntorio, XXVII. 92- 108),\n1\nin which Dante describes his dream\nbefore the dawn of the day on which he entered the Earthly\nParadise :\n\" sleep fell on me, sleep which oft doth know the news ere the\nfact come to pass.\nIn the hour, methinks, when Cytherea, who seemeth ever burning\nwith fire of love, first beamed from the east on the mount,\nmeseemed to behold in a dream, a lady, young and fair, going\nalong a plain gathering flowers ; and singing she said :\n'\nKnow, whoso asketh my name, that I am Leah, and go moving\nmy fair hands around to make me a garland.\nTo please me at the glass here I deck me ; but Rachel my sister\nne'er stirs from her mirror, and sitteth all day.\nShe is fain to behold her fair eyes, as I to deck me with my hands :\nher, contemplation ;\nme, action, doth satisfy.'\n\"\nThis passage gives us Leah and Rachel only ; Martha and\nMary are not mentioned in the Commedia at all, but in the\nTemple Edition there is a note to this passage as follows :\n[In] this third and last vision of Dante's . . . Leah and Rachel,\nthe Old Testament types of the Active and Contemplative Life\nappear to him. ... In the New Testament the types are repre-\nsented by Martha and Mary, see Convivio, IV. 17 ; 85-111.\nOn the other hand, Gary's Translation of Dante has the\nfollowing note on Purgatorio, XXVII. 101 :\nBy Leah is understood the active life as Rachel figures the con-\ntemplative. Michel Angelo has made these allegorical personages\nthe subject of two statues on the monument of Julius II. in the\nchurch of S. Pietro in Vincoli.\nConversely Dr. Gsell Pels, in speaking of the Leah and\nRachel of the tomb, 2\nrefers to Purgatorio, XXVII. 108. Since,\nfurther, it is well known that Michael Angelo greatly admired\nDante, and earnestly desired to be allowed to erect a monu-\n1\nTemple Edition ; translation by Thomas Okey.\n2\nRom und die Campagna, p. 808.\n\fLXVIII.] Some \" Concordant Automatisms.\" 137\nmeiit to him at Florence instead of labouring at the tombs\nof persons in whom he took no interest, there seems little\ndoubt that his Leah and Rachel were intended to embody\nDante's conception of them. In any case his is the most\nfamous representation of them in art, as Dante's is in litera-\nture, and I believe that the script alludes to both.\nIf this interpretation is correct, we should expect to find\nin the script some allusion to the most famous feature of the\ntomb (and of the Church of San Pietro in Vincoli), namely,\nthe statue of Moses ; and this, I believe, is to be found (as\nsuggested in the previous chapter, p. 113) in the phrase \" He\nthe strong smiter, the earth-compeller.\" This is a not in-\nappropriate description of the Moses of the tomb, which\nrepresents the active ruler, lawgiver, and judge, and not the\ncontemplative side of Moses' life. (See below, Plate XII.)\nMrs. Holland, who is unfamiliar with Dante's works, knew\nnothing of the passage about Leah and Rachel in the Purgatorio.\nShe has never been to Rome, and consequently has not seen\nMichael Angelo's Moses ; nor did she know that it is placed\nbetween statues of Leah and Rachel until I told her of this\nfact, having myself discovered it some time after Leah and\nRachel had been mentioned in her script. She had attached\nno meaning to \" the strong smiter, the earth-compeller.\"\nMichael Angelo was working at this tomb at intervals for\na great part of his life, 1505-1545. It was originally ordered\nin 1505 by Julius II., who, as mentioned above (see p. 23),\npulled down the old St. Peter's church, and planned and\nbegan the present building (of San Pietro in Vaticano),\nwith a special view to its containing his own tomb, which\nwas planned on a colossal scale, with some forty statues in\nmarble and bronze, besides bas-reliefs and ornamental figures.\nAfter the death of Julius II. in 1513, the work was stopped\nfor a time and resumed at intervals by the orders of his rela-\ntions. The tomb was finally placed in San Pietro in Vincoli,\nof which he had been Cardinal. Of the figures on it, Moses\nis by Michael Angelo, and Leah and Rachel are either his\nwork, or at least designed by him and executed partly by\nhim and partly under his supervision. The Virgin and Child,\nand the Prophet and Sibyl, above, were also designed by\nMichael Angelo.\n\f138 Alice Johnson. (\"part\nThe two \" Bound Captives \" or \" Slaves \" now in the\nLouvre were executed by Michael Angelo for the tomb, as\nwere the four unfinished figures now in the Grotto Buon-\ntalenti of the Boboli Gardens at Florence. One figure from\neach of these sets is shown in Plates XIII. and XIV. They\nwere meant to represent the provinces conquered by the\nwarlike Pope Julius II.\nIf I am right in thinking that Mrs. Verrall's scripts of March\n4 and 25, 1907, refer to this church (which, as explained above,\nrepresents St. Peter Bound and Unbound) and to St. Peter's\npowers of binding and loosing, it seems not unreasonable\nto conjecture that, in the repeated phrases about binding and\npersons bound to pillars, etc., which no doubt apply primarily\nto Hercules and St. Sebastian, a secondary reference is intended\nto these symbols of the material power not only claimed but\nfreely exercised by a Pope who acted as a Club-bearer rather\nthan a Key-bearer.\n[Extract from report of sitting with Mrs. Piper on April 8, 1907.)\n(Present : Mrs. Sidgwick only.)\n(Myers communicating)\nDo you remember euripides.\nE.

The \" Transcript from Euripides \" is Browning's\ntranslation of the Hercules Furens ; so that we find in this\nscript the fulfilment of the statement in Mrs. Verrall's script\nof March 4, 1907 :\n\" Ask elsewhere for the Bound Hercules.\"\nBalaustiou, the \" Wild-pomegranate-flower,\" is \" the lyric\ngirl \" from the island of Rhodes, who saved a shipful of her\nfellow-countrymen by reciting to the Sicilians the Alcestis of\nEuripides, in return for which they allowed the ship that\nwas carrying her to take refuge in the harbour of Syracuse\nfrom pursuing pirates. 2\nThis is the subject of the poem\nBalaustiou''s Adventure ; including a Transcript from Euri-\npides, i.e. Browning's translation of the Alcestis. Balaustion\nis therefore especially associated with the two plays of Euri-\npides dealing with the adventures of Heracles.\nIn the second poem she is fleeing from Athens after its\nconcpiest by Sparta. On the voyage she tells her fellow-\ntravellers, of whom the dramatist Philemon is one, how\nAristophanes with his boon-companions came to her house a\nyear earlier, on the night that the news of Euripides' death\nreached Athens, and how she then recited the Hercules Furens,\nthe original tablets of which had been given to her by Euri-\npides himself, in memory of her first adventure with his other\nHeracles play, as a parting gift when he left Athens.\nThe association of Philemon with Euripides in the script\nshows that the reference is to Aristophanes'' Apology. The\nphrase, \" To fly to find Euripides,\" is derived from two pas-\nsages in it : one is the opening of the final section of the poem,\nthe words being spoken by Balaustion :\nAnd see if young Philemon,\u2014sure one day\nTo do good service and be loved himself,\n\u2014\nIf he too have not made a votive verse !\n1\nThe fourth letter of this word in the original script is doubtful ; it might\nbe a or u.

They are not like machines in the hands of an\nexternal operator with no will or initiative of their own ;\nit seems rather that their own minds are working actively,\nbut under the guidance of a supervising intelligence\u2014what I\nhave called above the \" author.'' The result is a joint com-\nposition, in which, however, it sometimes seems possible to\ndisentangle the product of the writer from the product of the\n\f144 Alice Johnson. [part\n\" author,\" and I propose to attempt this in regard to some of\nthe cases given above.\nBut in the first one\n\u2014\" Ave Roma immortalis \"\u2014there are\nhints of the influence of yet another person, namely, Dr.\nVerrall ; and this may be instructively compared with \" The\none-horse dawn \" case in Mrs. Verrall's first Report,1\nwhen\nDr. Verrall in 1901 made a definite attempt to convey to\nher telepathically the three Greek words ixovoiruihov e? aa>,\nand fragments both of the Greek words and their English\nequivalents, as well as allusions to them, appeared in her\nscript.\nThe words were taken from a passage set for translation in\none of the papers in the Classical Tripos Examination of 1873,\nin which Dr. Verrall had been a candidate. But among the\nscript references to them occurred the remark\n\u2014\nFind the herb moly that will help\u2014it is a guide tl\nVTei Kai\nTe'Ao? X)\/\\f\/e\/f [sic]. [Seek and you will find at last, or, Seek and\nyou will grasp the end.]\nOne of the most familiar associations in English 2\nliterature\nwith \" the herb moly \" is. of course,\n\" that- moly\nWhich Hermes once to wise Ulysses gave\n\"\nin Milton's Comus, and Mrs. Verrall thought that her script\nwas alluding to this. Some three years later she found that\nthe passage containing these lines had been set as the subject\nfor Latin Hexameters in the same Tripos. The recollection\nof this had entirely gone from Dr. VerralFs mind, so much so\nthat even the sight of the passage in Comus (after Mrs. Ver-\nrall had made the discovery in the spring of 1005) did not\nrevive in him any memory of having translated it in the\nTripos.\nThus Mrs. VerralFs script had registered not only an existing\nmental impression of her husband's, but also a completely\n1\nProc, Vol. XX., pp. 150-107.\n- Some of our foreign critics, such as Dr. Maxwell, have not always suffi-\nciently considered that phrases in the scripts which are unfamiliar to them\nmay at once suggest to an English reader some, to him well known, literary\nassociation\n\fLXVIII.] Som,e \" Concordant Automatisms.\" 145\nforgotten past impression, once closely associated with the\nfirst.\nIt is conceivable that the idea of the \" herb moly \" came\ninto the script through telepathy from Dr. Arthur Myers\n(who had died about 7 years before) who had been a fellow-\ncandidate with Dr. Verrall in the Tripos of 1873 and an inti-\nmate friend of his, and to whom some parts of the script\nseemed to allude. But, if this case stood alone, it would no\ndoubt seem more probable that Dr. Verrall had been the tele-\npathic agent both in regard to what he deliberately and con-\nsciously tried to transfer (the words hovoitwXov e? aw), and\nin regard to what he certainly did not consciously try to\ntransfer, namely, the lines from Comus which must have\nbeen within his subliminal recollections.\nIn ordinary experiments in telepathy we meet occasionally\nwith cases where some subliminal idea of the agent's seems\nto have been transferred to the percipient, though it is, I\nthink, very rarely one which has so completely lapsed from\nmemory as in this case of Dr. Verrall's. Also, what happened\nin this case was something more than the mechanical repro-\nduction of a lapsed impression. Not only did \" the herb moly \"\nemerge, but it was coupled with the remark that it would\nhelp\u2014would be a guide. Somebody, then, not only remem-\nbered \" the herb moly \", but was able to reason in an intelligent\nway about it. The recollection may be attributed to Dr.\nVerrall's subliminal mind ; it is, I think, less easy to attri-\nbute to him the power of putting together subliminally the\ntwo impressions\u2014one supraliminal and the other subliminal\n\u2014\nand reasoning upon them in this way. The mental action\ninvolved suggests some one with a more complete grip of the\nwhole circumstances than he presumably had.\nAve Roma.\nIn the \" Ave Roma \" case, there is no clear evidence that\nDr. Verrall exercised any influence at all ; we know, at least,\nthat he had no intention of doing so ; and from the fresh facts\nas to the meaning of Mrs. Verrall's scripts adduced in this\npaper, it looks as if he had had less influence on them than\nwas surmised at the time, and as if the action of the \" author\n\"\nK\n\f146 Alice Johnson. [part\nhead been a larger factor in the whole cross-correspondence\nthan was represented in my first report on it.\nDr. Verrall, it appears, guessed correctly the meaning of\nthe first script as referring to Raphael's picture ; he did\nnot tell Mrs. Verrall what he had guessed, but it might be\nimagined that he had telepathically influenced her next scripts.\nHere, however, the \" author \" intervenes ; and\u2014the first\nsubject having been guessed\u2014gives her a totally different\nsubject for the second script, while wording it in such a way\nthat it might be thought to be only a continuation of the\nfirst subject. And this was what we all originally took it\nto be.\nThe riddle in this second script of Mrs. Verrall's answers\nfairly well to the definition given at the beginning of this\npaper,\u2014something so veiled and obscure that no one guesses\nits meaning at the time, and yet so explicit that when the\nclue is found, there can be no doubt of the meaning.\n\" Pagan and Pope ; the Stoic Persecutor and the Christian ;\nGregory\u2014not Basil's friend\u2014ought to be a clue.\" Here are\ntwo pairs of associated persons, and a fifth, somehow con-\nnected with them. One only of the five persons is described\nquite explicitly,\u2014the \" Stoic Persecutor,\" who can only be\nMarcus Aurelius. \" Gregory \" may be one of several Gregorys,\nbut it is pretty clear from the whole context that he must be\na Pope, and he must have some relation to the two pairs.\nMrs. Verrall imagined at the time that there might be some\nreference in the script to the Pilgrim's Progress, but did not\nthink that this completely explained it, since it accounted\nonly for the Pagan, Pope, and Christian. On the other hand,\nmy solution of the five persons as Trajan and St. Peter, Marcus\nAurelius and St. Paul, and Pope Gregory I., fits the script\nexactly, and I think that any one who reads the whole case\ncan hardly doubt its correctness.\nHere the facts given in the scripts are within the knowledge,\nsupraliminal or subliminal, not only of Dr. Verrall, but of\nMrs. Verrall ; but the special point selected for mention in\nthe script\u2014the connection of the Columns with St. Peter\nand St. Paul\u2014is one so unfamiliar to them, or so unimportant\nin their eyes, that neither of them recognised the allusion to\nit, and when I told Mrs. Verrall of it, she could not remember\n\fLXVIII.] Some \"Concordant Automatisms.'\" 147\nthat she had ever heard the fact before. My full discussion\nof the case, however, shows that this point adds considerably\nto the significance of the whole cross-correspondence by\nhelping to complete the rough sketch of an outline of the\nhistory of Rome, which I take to be implied in it.\nI think it is difficult to attribute either to Dr. Verrall or to\nMrs. Verrall the intention to give a thumb-nail sketch of the\nhistory of Rome, such as can be elicited from the scripts. If\nI am right in thinking that the intention is there, it must\nrather be attributed to the \" author.\"\nAnother essential feature in the case is the connection\nwith Mrs. Holland's script. The intention to make some\nsuch connection was not in Mrs. Verrall's conscious mind,\nbecause it was not one of the days fixed for her experiments\nwith Mrs. Holland. Still less was the intention in Dr. Ver-\nrall's mind ; he was interested only in interpreting Mrs.\nVerrall's scripts. Nevertheless, if the connection between the\nscripts of the two writers had been only a simple and straight-\nforward similarity in phrasing or idea, we should naturally\nput it down to telepathy between them. But it is far from\nbeing simple and straightforward. It involves not simple\nreproduction, but a good deal of reasoning and intelligence.\nThe fresh facts adduced in this paper show that the Holland\nphrase \" Ave Roma immortalis \" is even more appropriate\nto the Verrall scripts with their summary of Roman history\nthan it appeared when the case was first published.\nSomebody must have grasped the whole gist of those scripts,\nin a way that Dr. and Mrs. Verrall certainly had not con-\nsciously grasped them, to be able to make so intelligent a\nsumming up of them. And the Holland phrase \" How could\nI make it any clearer without giving her the clue ?\n\" shows\nthat somebody was reasoning about them in a way no one of\nus up to that time had consciously reasoned ;\nsomebody saw\nthe advantage of their obscurity for evidential purposes as\nno one of us saw it.\nThe Sevens Case.\nAnother case where there are indications of the telepathic\ninfluence of a living person other than one of the automatists\nis the much-discussed \" Sevens Case \" (Prnc, Vol. XXIV..\n\f148 Alice Johnson. [PART\npp. 222-258). It will be remembered that six automatists\nwere concerned in this case, and that the cross-correspondence\ncombined in itself two main topics, one (a) coinciding with\nthe contents of a sealed envelope which Mr. Piddington had\nplanned to transmit posthumously, variations on the theme\nof Seven, and the other (b) various passages from Dante having\nrelation to the number Seven. The second topic was unknown\nto Mr. Piddington, since he was very unfamiliar with Dante's\nworks, and had taken no interest in them until a later date,\nwhen allusions were beginning to be found to them in the\nscripts. The combination of the Dante allusions with Seven\ncannot therefore be put down even to a subliminal association\nof ideas in Mr. Piddington's mind. If the Sevens appeared in\nthe scripts through his agency, somebody else was responsible\nfor introducing Dante with the sevens. Further, two of the\nautomatists, Miss Verrall and Mrs. Frith, alluded independently\nto a certain episode in Dante which it appears had never\nbeen known to either of them.\nThis case was analysed and discussed fully in my first report\nof it. I there sought to show that, while in many instances\nindividual phrases in the scripts could be traced to some\nnormal source, a supernormal cause had to be premised for\nthe large number of coincidences between the scripts of dif-\nferent writers ; and that while some of these coincidences\nmight be supposed to be clue to telepathy from one person\n(Mr. Piddington) and some to telepathy from another (Mrs.\nVerrall), they could not all be so derived. But they were\nall connected together into a coherent scheme which was\nstrongly suggestive of the design of a single mind, and since\nthere were great difficulties in the way of supposing the whole\nof this scheme to be due either to Mr. Piddington or to Mrs.\nVerrall, it looked as if some other rrfind\u2014altogether outside\nour circle\u2014was at work.\nI suggested that this other mind\u2014the \" author \"\u2014surveying\nand selecting from the ideas normally arising in the minds of\nthe automatists and of Mr. Piddington. and making some\nuse of the play of telepathy between them, had moulded\nthese materials and influences for his own purposes and so\nproduced the cross-correspondence.\nIn the final part of my third report on Mrs. Holland's script\n\flxviii.] Some \" Concordant Automatisms.'' 149\n(P\/'oc, Vol. XXV., pp. 282-293) the function of selection in\nthe production of scripts was further discussed. It was sug-\ngested that the mental resources and activities of the writers\nplayed an important, if not an essential, part in the whole\nbusiness, the main work of the \" author \" being to determine\nwhich of their whole stock of ideas shall emerge in the scripts.\nOn this hypothesis it will be an advantage to the \" author\n\"\nto employ writers with a large and varied stock of ideas, each\nwith numerous literary and other associations, which will\nprovide him with ample material for building up various and\ncomplicated designs by combining the scripts of different\nwriters. In other words, the more educated and the more\nintelligent are the writers, the more opportunity is afforded\nto the \" author \" for demonstrating his independence of them.\nIn the present paper, special stress is laid on the necessity\nthat the \"'\nauthor \" is under of concealing his design from all\nof us till his experiment is complete. The necessity is of\ncourse purely for experimental purposes. The \" author \" is\nacting, as suggested above, in the same way that an agent\nin telepathic experiments acts when he conceals the object\nthat he is looking at from the percipient, so as to prevent the\nlatter from gaining a knowledge of it through the normal\nsensory channels. Our \" author \" has to take still further\nprecautions to prevent the writers from acquiring knowledge\ntelepathically. He will then be able to go on influencing the\nscripts without being interfered with by the influence of the\nexperimenters, or the self-suggestions of the writers.\nOne of the devices apparently used for purposes of con-\ncealment is to allude to some minor and unfamiliar feature\nof an object, instead of to a familiar one which would be\nlikely to reveal it at once. Thus Mrs. Verrall's phrase \" Pagan\nand Pope\u2014the Stoic Persecutor and the Christian \" alludes,\nif my interpretation is right, to a definite fact in regard to\nthe Columns of Trajan and Marcus Aurelius, but a fact that\nwould have hardly any interest or importance in the eyes of\nthe great majority of people\u2014at least, in the present day\n\u2014\nwho are interested in the Columns,\u2014a fact that probably\npasses altogether unnoticed by the mass of sight-seers in\nRome.\n\fi;>o Alice Johnson. [part\nAgain, in referring to the tomb of -Julius II., Leah and\nRachel alone are explicitly mentioned in Mrs. Holland's script\n;\nAvhile the feature for which the tomb is world-renowned, the\nstatue of Moses, is given implicitly only. People go to see it\nprimarily to see Moses ; the Moses is certainly the first associa-\ntion that would arise in one's mind on hearing the monu-\nment mentioned ; and the figure of Moses alone is constantly\nreproduced, whereas it is very rare to find illustrations showing\nmore of the tomb than his single figure. Mrs. Holland, as\nmentioned above, was to the best of her belief ignorant that\nit was placed between figures of Leah and Rachel.\nA still more striking instance is \" Alexander's Tomb.\"\nIt is a fact that Alessandro de' Medici was buried in the tomb\nof the younger Lorenzo ; but this is probably the first time on\nrecord that the tomb has been described as Alexander's.\nOther features of it are widely known ; the one fact that\ngenerally drops out of sight is the one selected for mention\nin the script,\u2014and this, too, in the script of Miss Verrall who,\nthere is every reason to believe, was ignorant of it (see below,\np. 152).\nIt is a commonplace of psychology that only a selection, and\na small selection, of the sensory stimuli that reach the brain\nresult in conscious impressions. We notice a few items, and\na few only, of our surroundings. We notice, for instance,\nthose that somebody else has pointed out to us, or those that\nhappen to have attracted our attention when we first saw the\nplace and which, therefore, strike us as familiar when we see\nit again. But we might fail to recognise a representation of\na known place or object if the different items in it had not the\nsame relative conspicuousness that they have in our idea\nof it. Even a photograph often looks odd and unfamiliar,\nbecause the sensitivity of a photographic plate is not exactly\nthe same as the sensitivity of the retina, apart from the fact\nthat there is of course no mental selection determining what\nis, or what is not, prominent in a photograph.\nBut now let us suppose that the mental selection of percep-\ntions was the reverse of what it usually is ;\nsuppose that all\nour subliminal perceptions became supraliminal and vice\nversa ;\nsuppose we noticed the items we had never noticed\nbefore, and failed to notice all those we had noticed before.\n\fLxvm.] Some \" Concordant. Automatisms.\" 151\nEverything would then appear unfamiliar to us ; we should\nnot recognise anything we saw. It would be difficult to\nimagine a more complete disguise.\nThis, I would suggest, is the sort of disguise that the \" author\n\"'\ninfuses into the scripts, in the cases just mentioned, by selecting\nthe unfamiliar instead of the familiar items, and the disguise\nwas for long effective.\nOn the working hypothesis that the *'\nauthor \" wished to\nconceal his meaning in order to prevent the writers from\nhelping each other telepathically, we devised the experiment\nof the Latin Message. One of the cases most closely approxi-\nmating to that type previously published was the one given\nin my third report on Mrs. Holland, when the subject of\nPrometheus bringing fire from heaven as a gift to men was\ngiven in Mrs. Verrall's script of Sept. 23, 1908 ; the subject\nof Time and Eternity was given in Miss Verrall' s of\nNov. 19, 1908; and Mrs. Holland's script of Dec. 30, 1908\n(produced of course in ignorance of the two others) combined\nthese two separate subjects in a quotation from Shelley's\nPrometheus Unbound (see Proc, Vol. XXV., pp. 255-261).\nThe cogency of this and similar cases, as evidence for the\nagency of an \" author \" distinct from the writers, depends on\nthe greater or less difficulty of attributing the ideas to the\nminds of the writers : it seems very improbable that Mrs.\nVerrall associated the Prometheus of her script with Time\nand Eternity, and very improbable that Miss Verrall asso-\nciated the Time and Eternity of her script with Prometheus ;\nconsequently it looks as if the association came into Mrs.\nHolland's script from some mental source other than their\nminds.\nAlexander's Tomb.\nThe case of \" Alexander's Tomb \" is an almost perfect\ninstance of the Latin Message type ; the essential items being\ndistributed between the three automatists, Mrs. Piper, Miss\nVerrall and Mrs. Holland, as follows :\n(Mrs. Piper.) Moorhead. I gave her that for laurel.\n(See p. 64.)\n(Miss Verrall.) Alexander's Tomb. Laurel. (See p. 68.)\n(Mrs. Holland.) Alexander Moors Head. (See p. 70.)\n\f152 Alice Johnson. [part\nHere, as suggested in the Latin Message, two different\nmessages, \" Moorhead \" and \" Alexander's Tomb,\" between\nwhich no connection is discernible, are given to two different\nwriters, Mrs. Piper and Miss Verrall ; and shortly afterwards\na third message, \"Alexander Moors Head \" is given to a\nthird writer, Mrs. Holland, which ultimately reveals the hidden\nconnection between the first two. The \" author,\" it is to be\nnoted, has somewhat improved on our plan by getting both\nthe first two writers to put \" Laurel \" in their scripts, showing\nthat a connection existed between them, and that therefore\nthe two scripts should be compared. But, even after the\ndiscovery that \" Alexander's Tomb \" was one of the Medici\ntombs, it is hardly conceivable that any one would have seen\nthe connection between this and \" Moorhead \" if Mrs. Holland's\nscript\u2014written, of course, in complete ignorance of the other\ntwo\u2014had not contained the combination \" Alexander Moors\nHead.\"\nIn some cases where the items of a cross-correspondence are\ndistributed between the scripts of several writers in such a\nway as to suggest the design of an outside mind, it is possible\nto surmise that the items which were absent from a writer's\nscript were present in her subliminal consciousness and might\nhave been transferred thence telepathically to the mind of\nanother writer. But this can hardly occur unless the writer\nhas some knowledge of the topic of the script. As to the\nknowledge possessed by the writers in this case, I think it\nmay be regarded as certain that Mrs. Piper, who wrote first,\nknew practically nothing of the Medici or of the Medici tombs,\nand nothing at all of Alexander de' Medici. Miss Verrall,\nwho wrote second, makes the following statement :\nI have never been to Florence, and therefore have never seen\nthe Medici tombs. Before my script was written I knew of their\nexistence, but I have no conscious recollection of ever seeing any\nreproductions of them ; on this point, however, I cannot be cpiite\ncertain. I have never made any special study of the history of\nthe Medici family, and have only a vague, general knowledge\nconcerning it. I had never to my belief heard of Alexander\nde' Medici, until Miss Johnson spoke of him to me, at the time\nthat she was writing her paper. I had supposed the phrase in\n\flxviii.] Some \" Concordant Automatisms.\" 153\nmy script \" Alexander's tomb \" to refer to Alexander the Great,\nmerely because he is the person one thinks of first, whenever the\nname is mentioned.\nHelen de G. Verrall.\nMrs. Holland stayed in Florence for some months a good\nmany years ago and consequently knows the tombs ; but her\nscript about \" Alexander \" was written a month after Mrs.\nPiper's, and ten days after Miss Verrall's, which makes it\nimpossible to regard her as the originator of the topic, except\non the hypothesis that she designed the cross-correspondence\nsubliminally, and purposely withheld her contribution to it. till\nthe contributions of the other automatists were completed\nFurther, there is, I think, internal evidence in the scripts\nthemselves that the writers not only failed to understand them,\nbut that they positively misinterpreted them. It is, indeed,\ndifficult to attach any meaning at all to Mrs. Piper's utterance\n\" Moorhead\u2014laurel\u2014for laurel\u2014I say I gave her that for\nlaurel.\" This, taken alone, sounds like incoherent nonsense.\nBut in Miss Verrall's script \" Alexander's tomb \" is connected\nwith \" laurel leaves,\" and \" laurel for the victor's brow.\"\nThis naturally suggests Alexander the Great ; we all supposed\nat the time that he was the person meant, and\u2014since Miss\nVerrall had, as she believes, never heard of Alexander de'\nMedici\u2014she too, subliminally as well as supraliminally, must\nhave put the same interpretation on it.\nIn Mrs. Holland's script, again, \" Alexander Moors Head \"\nis connected with drawings of masts and the words \" The tall\nmast, but this one is not at sea.\" This must mean the tall\nmasts (150 feet high) of the Lodge-Muirhead wireless telegraphy\napparatus used in the \" Diamond Island experiment \" referred\nto in Mrs. Holland's script of January 17, 1904 (see Proc,\nVol. XXV., pp. 293 et seq.) ; and since Sir Oliver Lodge's\nexperiments in wireless telegraphy had been referred to on\nseveral other occasions in her script, once with a punning\nreference to the Lodge-Muirhead system, I felt no doubt that\n\" Alexander Moors Head \" meant Dr. Alexander Muirheacl.\nI think there is strong ground for believing that this was also\nthe view of Mrs. Holland's subliminal self. Otherwise, why\nthe masts %\n\f154 Alice Johnson. [part\nBut when we get a real clue to the meaning of the scripts,\nwe find that many phrases in them have more point than\nappeared at first. Miss Verrall's \" Laurel leaves are emblem \"\nhas a special application, as I have shown, to the younger,\nas well as the elder, Lorenzo de' Medici, and hence to his\ntomb-fellow Alexander, but is only in a vague and general\nway appropriate to Alexander the Great. In Mrs. Holland's\nscript, Twilight, and Light and Darkness, have a special\napplication to the tomb of Alexander de' Medici, but none to\nDr. Alexander Muirhead. In the same script, her quotations\nfrom Othello (\" Antres vast and deserts idle,\" \" One not\neasily jealous \"), following the name \" Alexander Moors Head,\"\nwere regarded by me as an ordinary instance of association of\nideas ;\n\u2014\" Moors,\" I imagined, had suggested Othello the\nMoor. There is, however, no point in putting together Othello\nand Dr. Muirhead ;\nwhereas there is a definite point in putting\ntogether Othello, the Moor of Venice, and Alexander the\nMoor, of Florence. It looks then as if the \" author,\" out of\na number of associations with \" Moors Head,\" has deliberately\nand carefully selected one that fits in admirably with his\nspecial purpose and has influenced the writer to express it,\nand has then left her subliminal mind free to select another\nassociation\n\u2014\" the tall mast \"\u2014in order to show what her own\nsubliminal interpretation of the script is.\nThe Medici tombs and topics associated with them frequently\nrecurred in the various scripts from 1906 onwards. We had\nnot understood them and the \" author \" was, presumably,\naware of our misinterpretations and failures to understand.\nSome time later, in June, 1910, he gave the main topic ex-\nplicitly in Mrs. Willett's script, in the phrase \" The Laurentian\ntombs.\" No one of us, however, observed the relevance of\nthis to the other scripts until in July, 1912, we came upon the\nfact of Alexander de' Medici's burial in one of those tombs.\nIt then became apparent that the \" author \" had in Mrs.\nWillett's script given the solution of his enigma.\nBut the critic, if he admits the general soundness of my argu-\nment, may object that the cross-correspondences seem to be\na series of rather childish, if ingenious puzzles, amounting to\nlittle more than a trial of wits between the \" author \" and\n\flxviii.] Some \" Concordant Automatisms.\" 155\nourselves, and I am acutely aware that the present paper is\nlikely on the face of it to heighten this impression. Granting\nthat the \" author \" is trying experiments, many may be repelled\nby the apparent inappropriateness of their subject-matter to\nthe question of survival.\nIn reply to this, I would urge in the first place that if the\n\" author \" can prove his independent activity, the means he\nchooses for this purpose will justify themselves. I would\nnext point out that, while the cross-correspondences between\nthe scripts of different writers seemed at first to consist merely\nof verbal similarities or coincidences of topic, further study\nshowed that they were far more complicated and elaborate\nthan we had supposed, involving many more scripts and often\nseveral different subjects ; sometimes including items of\nliterary or historical interest unknown to the writers whose\nscript furnished the cross-correspondence and characteristic\nin many ways of the supposed \" author,\" and in general more\nand more difficult to explain on the hypothesis of the unaided\nsubliminal powers of the writers. Since this further study\nhas already been so fruitful, it seems not unreasonable to hope\nthat, if continued, it may reveal in the scripts meanings of a\ndeeper import than has hitherto been suspected.\nThese meanings will, however, only be appreciated at their\ntrue value by persons who will take the trouble to make a\nserious study of the cross-correspondences, for it is chiefly in\nthese that the significance of the scripts is manifested. I have\ntried to show that they must be studied in much the same way\nthat ordinary literature is studied, since in point of fact they\nare a kind of literature. But the problems involved in them\nmust appeal equally to the intellectual curiosity of the literary\nman, of the scientist, and of the philosopher.\n\f156 Alice Johnson [part\nLIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS.\nPLATES I. to V. illustrate the \" Ave Roma immortalis \" case, see\npp. 11-24.\nPlate I. \u2014Raphael. \u2014Meeting of Leo and Attila.\nPlate II. \u2014Column of Trajan.\nPlate III. \u2014Column of Marcus Aurelius.\nPlate IV. \u2014Detail of Raphael's Meeting of Leo and Attila.\nPlate V. \u2014Detail of Trajan's Column.\nPlates VI. to X. illustrate the \" Alexander's Tomb \" case, see\npp. 50-76.\nPlate VI.\u2014Benozzo Gozzoli. \u2014The Procession of the Magi.\nPlate VII.\u2014Botticelli.\u2014The Birth of Venus.\nPlate VIII. \u2014Bronzino. \u2014Alessandro de' Medici.\nPlate IX. \u2014Tomb of Lorenzo, Duke of Urbino.\nPlate X. \u2014Tomb of Giuliano, Duke of Nemours.\nPlates XI. to XIV. illustrate the \" Clavigers\" case, see pp. 127-143.\nPlate XL\u2014Mosaic of St. Sebastian.\nPlate XII.\u2014Tomb of Pope Julius II.\nPlate XIII. \u2014Michael Angelo.\u2014A Slave.\nPLATE XIV.\u2014Michael Angelo.\u2014A Bound Captive.\n\f\fPlate II.\nCOLUMN OF TRAJAN.\n\fPlate III.\nCOLUMN OF MARCUS AURELIUS.\n\fPlate IV.\ndetail or Raphael's meeting of leo and attila.\n\fPlate V.\nDETAIL OF THE COLUMN OF TRAJAN.\n\f\f\fPlate VIII.\nMiliar!

Wildon Carr, D.Litt.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nLet me say at once how much I appreciate the great\nhonour you have done me in electing me President of your\nSociety. It is an honour I am conscious I have done nothing\nto deserve. It is only by reading that I know anything of\nthe phenomena with which the Society deals ; I have seen\nnothing myself, I have examined nothing myself. How is\nit then that you have come to choose me to succeed the great\nand eminent men of science and letters who have occupied\nin turn the presidential chair, most of whom, while univer-\nsally recognised for their knowledge and ability, have also\nbeen men whose minds were particularly pre-occupied with\nthe study of these mysterious phenomena ? If a jest on such\na subject may be allowed, I might say that here is a case of\ntelepathy or clairvoyance ;\n\u2014you felt from afar the interest I\nwas taking in your researches, you perceived me, across the\ntwo hundred and fifty miles of space which separated us,\nattentively reading your Proceedings and following with keen\ncuriosity your work. The ingenuity, the penetration, the\npatience, the tenacity you have shown in the exploration of\nthe terra incognita of psychical phenomena appear to me truly\nadmirable. But still more than the ingenuity and the pene-\nL\n\f158 Professor Henri Bergson. [part\ntration, still more than the unwearying perseverance with\nwhich you have continued your course, I admire the courage\nwhich it required, especially during the first years, to struggle\nagainst the prejudices of a great part of the scientific world,\nand to brave the mockery which strikes fear into the boldest\nbreast. This is why I am proud\u2014prouder than I can say\n\u2014\nto have been elected President of the Society for Psychical\nResearch. I have read somewhere the story of an inferior\nofficer whom the chances of the battle,\u2014the death or wounds\nof his superiors,\u2014raised to the honour of the command of\nhis regiment ; all his life he thought of it, all his life he talked\nof it, the memory of those few hours suffused his whole exist-\nence. I am that inferior officer, and I shall always pride\nmyself on the happy chance which has set me\u2014not for a few\nhours, but for some months\u2014at the head of a valiant regiment.\nWhence come the prejudices which for so long a time we\nall have had, and which some have still, in regard to psychical\nstudies ? Why is it that men of science, who consider it\nquite natural that under their direction we should pursue\napparently insignificant laboratory investigations, and who\nthink, with good reason, that there is nothing insignificant\nin science, yet manifest such repugnance towards researches\nlike yours, and even hesitate to regard them as scientific ?\nThat is the point on which I wish to speak. Far from me\nis the intention of criticising their criticism for the sake of\ncriticising. It seems to me that in philosophy the time given\nup to refutation is generally time lost. Of the many attacks\ndirected by so many thinkers against one another, what\nremains ? Nothing, or next to nothing. That which counts,\nthat which lasts, is the positive truth we bring out ; the true\naffirmation itself displaces the false idea, and without the\ntrouble of refuting any one, proves to be the best refutation.\nBut quite another thing is here in question than either re-\nfuting or criticising. I want to show that behind the pre-\njudices of some, the mockery of others, there is, present and\ninvisible, a certain metaphysic, unconscious of itself, uncon-\nscious and therefore inconsistent, unconscious and therefore\nincapable of continually remodelling itself on observation and\nexperience as every philosophy worthy of the name must\ndo,\u2014that moreover this metaphysic is natural, due to a bent\n\fLXVIII.] Presidential Address. 159\ncontracted long ago by the human mind, and on that account\nour whole interest is to search it out behind the criticisms\nor the mockeries which conceal it, in order to put ourselves\non guard against it : we shall thus prevent it from acting on\nourselves, prevent it from raising artificial obstacles on our\nown path. But before I enter on that question which is\nconcerned with the subject-matter of your studies, I wish\nto say a word on the method you follow, a method which I\ncan well understand is disconcerting to a certain number of\nmen of science.\nThere is nothing more displeasing to the professional student\nthan to see applied to a science of the same order as his own\na method usually confined to subjects of a quite different\norder. He holds to his methods as the workman to his tools.\nIt was William James, I think, who defined the difference\nbetween the professional and the amateur by saying that\nthe latter interests himself especially in the result obtained,\nthe former in the way in which we obtain it. Well, the pheno-\nmena with which you are occupied are undeniably of the same\nkind as those which form the subject-matter of natural science,\nwhilst the method you follow, and that you are obliged to\nfollow, has often no relation with that of any of the sciences\nof nature.\nI say they are facts of the same kind. I mean by this\nthat they are subject to laws, and that they are capable of\nbeing repeated indefinitely in time and in space. They are\nnot facts like those, for instance, with which the historian\ndeals. History does not repeat itself. The battle of Auster-\nlitz was fought once and it will never be fought again. It\nbeing impossible that the same historical conditions should\never be reproduced, the same historical fact cannot be re-\npeated ; and as a law expresses necessarily that to certain\ncauses, always the same, there will correspond an effect, also\nalways the same, history strictly speaking has no bearing\non laws, but on particular facts and on the no less particular\ncircumstances in which they were brought to pass. The only\nquestion here is to know if the event did really take place\nat such and such a definite moment of time and at such and\nsuch a determinate point of space, and in what way it was\nbrought about. On the contrary, a veridical hallucination,\n\u2014\n\f100 Professor Henri Bergson. [part\nthe apparition, for instance, of a dying man to a relation or\nfriend hundreds of miles, it may be, separated from him,\n\u2014\nis a fact which if it is real, is uncmestionably the manifestation\nof a law analogous to physical, chemical and biological laws.\nSuppose, let us say, that this phenomenon was due to an\ninfluence exercised across space by the consciousness of one\nof the two persons on the consciousness of the other ;\nsuppose,\nin other words, that the two human consciousnesses were\nable to communicate without visible intervention, that there\nwas what you call \" telepathy.\" If telepathy is a real\nfact, it is a fact that is capable of being repeated indefinitely.\nI go further, if telepathy is a real fact, it is very possible\nthat it is operating at every moment and everywhere, but\nwith too little intensity to be noticed, or else it is operating\nin the presence of obstacles which neutralise the effect at\nthe same moment that it manifests itself. We produce elec-\ntricity at every moment, the atmosphere is continually elec-\ntrified, we move among magnetic currents, yet millions of\nhuman beings lived for thousands of years without having\nsuspected the existence of electricity. It may be the same\nwith telepathy. But that matters little. What is indis-\nputable in any case is, that if telepathy is real, it is natural,\nand that whenever the day comes that we know its conditions,\nit will no more be necessary to wait for a veridical hallucination\nin order to obtain a telepathic effect than it is necessary for\nus now, if we wish to see an electric spark, to wait until the\nsky gives us a display during a thunderstorm.\nHere then is a phenomenon which it would seem ought,\nby reason of its nature, to be studied in the manner of a physical,\nchemical or biological fact. But not at all : you are obliged\nto begin with an entirely different method, one which stands\nmidway between that of the historian and that of the magis-\ntrate. Did the veridical hallucination take place in the past ?\n\u2014\nYou study documents, you criticise them, you write a page\nof history. Is it a fact of to-day ? \u2014You proceed to a kind\nof judicial enquiry ;\nyou examine the witnesses, confront\nthem with one another, and weigh the value of their evidence.\nFor my part, when I bring to mind the results of the admir-\nable enquiry you have conducted continually during more\nthan thirty years, when I think of all the precautions you\n\fLXVIII.] Presidentia I Address\n.\n161\nhave taken to avoid error, when I see that in most of the\ncases you have retained an account had been given to one\nperson or to more than one, often even noted down in writing\nby them, before the hallucination was recognised as veridical,\nwhen I take into account the enormous number of the facts,\nand especially their resemblance, the family likeness between\nthem, the agreement of so many witnesses independent of\none another, all examined, their testimony weighed and sub-\nmitted to criticism,\u2014I am led to believe in telepathy, just\nas I believe in the defeat of the Invincible Armada. My\nbelief is not the mathematical certainty that the demon-\nstration of Pythagoras' theorem gives me, it is not the physical\ncertainty that I have of the law of the fall of bodies, but it\nis at least all the certainty that we obtain in a historical\nor judicial matter.\nBut it is just this which is disconcerting to so many minds.\nThey find it strange that we should have to treat historically\nor judicially facts which, if they are real, surely obey laws,\nand ought then it seems to be amenable to the methods of\nobservation and experiment used in the natural sciences.\nArrange for the fact to be produced in a laboratory, they\nwill receive it gladly ; till then they hold it suspect. Just\nbecause \" psychical research \" cannot for the present proceed\nlike physics and chemistry, they conclude it is not scientific\n;\nand as the subject of that research has not yet taken that\nsimple and abstract form which opens to a fact access to the\nlaboratory, they are pleased to declare it unreal. Such, I\nthink, is the \" subconscious \" reasoning of some men of\nscience.\nI discover the same feeling, the same disdain for the con-\ncrete, at the root of the objections that are raised against\nsuch and such of your conclusions. I will cite only one ex-\nample. Some time ago I was at a dinner party at which\nthe conversation happened to turn on the phenomena which\nyour Society investigates, more particularly on the facts of\ntelepathy. There was an eminent physician present, one of\nour leading men of science. After listening attentively for\nsome minutes, he joined in the conversation, expressing him-\nself as nearly as I remember in these words :\n\" All that you\nare saying interests me very much, but I ask you to reflect\n\f1G2 Professor Henri Bergson. [part\nbefore drawing a conclusion. I also myself know an extra-\nordinary fact. And of this fact I guarantee the authenticity,\nfor it was related to me by a lady who is very intellectual\nand whose word inspires me with absolute confidence. The\nhusband of this lady was an officer. He was killed in the\ncourse of an engagement. Well, at the very moment at\nwhich the husband fell, the wife had the vision of the scene,\na clear vision, in all points conformable to the reality. You\nmay perhaps conclude from that, as this lady did, that it\nwas a case of clairvoyance or of telepathy ? . . . You will\nforget one thing only, and that is that it has happened many\ntimes that a wife has dreamed that her husband was dead\nor dying when he was quite well. We notice cases in which\nthe vision turns out to be true, but take no count of the\nothers. Were we to make the full return, we should see\nthat the coincidence is the work of simple chance.\"\nThe conversation turned off in I know not what direction ;\nthere was no question of serious discussion, it was neither\nthe time nor the place for it. But when we left the table\na very young girl who had been listening attentively came\nand said to me, \" It seems to me that Doctor X. . . . argued\nwrongly just now. I do not see what the fallacy in his argu-\nment was, but there must have been a fallacy.\" Yes, indeed,\nthere was a fallacy ! The young girl was right and the learned\ndoctor was wrong. He shut his eyes to what was concrete\nin the phenomenon. He argued thus :\n\" When one dreams\nthat a relation is dead or dying, either it is true or it is false ;\neither the person is actually dying or he is not dying. And\nconsequently, if the dream proves true, it is necessary in order\nto be sure that it is not an effect of chance to compare the\nnumber of cases in which it has proved true with the number\nof cases in which it has proved false.\" He did not see that\nthe apparent force of his argument rested on the fact that\nhe had substituted for the description of the concrete and\nliving scene,\u2014the officer falling at a given moment in a definite\nspot with such and such soldiers around him,\u2014this abstract\nand dead formula :\n\u2014\" The lady in dreaming was dreaming\nwhat was true and not what was false.\" Ah, if we accept\nthis transposition into the abstract, we must then indeed\ncompare in abstracto the number of true cases with the number\n\fLXVIII.] Presidential Address. 163\nof false ; and we shall find perhaps that there are more false\nthan true and our doctor will be right.\nBut this abstraction consists in neglecting that which is\nessential in it,\u2014the picture, that the lady perceived, and which\nwas found to be identical with a scene very distant from\nher. Do you suppose that a painter portraying part of a\nbattle on his canvas, and trusting to his fancy, could be so\nwell favoured by chance as to find that he had produced\nthe likeness of real soldiers, present that clay at a battle, in\nwhich they had stood in the attitudes he had portrayed ?\nEvidently not. The calculus of probabilities to which the\ndoctor made appeal would in this case show that it is im-\npossible, because a scene in which definite persons take definite\nattitudes is a thing unique of its kind ; because a human face,\neven taken alone, is already unique of its kind; and conse-\nquently each personage\u2014much more the scene which includes\nthem\u2014is decomposable into an infinity of details all inde-\npendent of one another ; so that there must have been an\ninfinite number of coincidences in order that chance should\nmake a fancied scene the exact reproduction of a real scene :\nin other words, it is mathematically impossible that a picture\ndrawn from the painter's imagination should portray part of a\nbattle such as it is. Well, the lady who had the vision of a part\nof a battle was in the situation of that painter ; her imagina-\ntion executed a picture. If the picture was the reproduction of\na real scene it must, by every necessity, be because she was in\ncommunication with that scene, or with a consciousness that\nhad the perception of it. I do not need to compare the number\nof \" true cases \" with the number of \" false cases \" ; statistics\nhave nothing to do with it ; the unique case which is presented\nto me is sufficient when I consider it with what is concrete in\nit. That is why, if it had been an occasion to discuss with\nthe doctor, I should have said to him :\n\" I do not know if\nthe story which was told you is exact ; I do not know if the\nlady of whom you speak had the vision of the actual scene\nwhich was going on at the time far away from her ; but if\nthis was proved to me, if I could be sure that even the coun-\ntenance of one soldier unknown by her, present at the scene,\nhad appeared to her such as it was in reality,\u2014then, even if\nit should be proved to me that there had been thousands of\n\f164 Professor Henri Bergson. [part\nfalse visions, and even though there had never been a veridical\nhallucination except this one, I should hold the existence of\ntelepathy,\u2014or of a cause, whatever it be, able to make us per-\nceive objects and events situated beyond the normal portal\nof our senses,\u2014to' be strictly and definitely established.\"\nBut enough on this point. I come to the deep-seated cause\nwhich, in directing the activity of workers in science exclu-\nsively in another direction, has until now retarded the pro-\ngress of \" psychical research.\"\nI have heard persons interested in your works express\nsurprise that modern science should have so long neglected\nthe facts with which you deal, when it ought in virtue of its\nexperimental character to be interested in researches which\nmay some day give rise to a host of new experiences. But\nwe must understand what it is that we call the experimental\ncharacter of modern science. Modern science has created the\nexperimental method ; so much is certain ; but it does not\nfollow that it has enlarged the field of experience which existed\nbefore it. Quite the contrary, it has often narrowed it ; and\nmoreover it is in that that its force lies.\nWhen we read the ancient writers we are struck by seeing\nhow they had observed and even experimented. But they\nobserved by chance and in it mattered not what direction.\nIn what did the creation of the \" experimental method \"\nconsist ? Simply in taking certain processes of observation and\nexperiment which already existed, and instead of applying\nthem in all possible directions, making them converge on to\none single point, measurement, \u2014the measurement of such or\nsuch a variable magnitude of which we suspect that it may be\na function of such or such other variable magnitudes, equally\nmeasurable.\n\" Law \" in the modern sense of the word is rightly the\nexpression of a constant relation between magnitudes which\nvary. Modern science is the offspring of mathematics, begotten\non the day when algebra had acquired sufficient force and\npliability to be able to enfold reality, to draw it into the net\nof its calculations. First appeared astronomy and mechanics\nunder the essentially mathematical form that the moderns have\ngiven them. Then was developed physics\u2014a physics equally\nmathematical. Physics gave rise to chemistry, this also being\n\fLXVIII.] Presidentia I Address\n.\n1(35\nfounded on measurements, on comparisons of weights and\nvolumes. After chemistry came biology, which without doubt\nhas not yet taken the mathematical form and is not near\ndoing so, but which seeks none the less by means of physiology\nto bring the laws of life under those of chemistry and physics,\n\u2014\nthat is to say, indirectly under those of mechanics. So that,\nin short, our science always tends to the mathematical form\nas to an ideal. It seems essential to it to measure, and wherever\ncalculation is not yet applicable, Avherever it must limit ioself\nto a description or to an analysis of its object, it arranges to\nset before itself only that side of the object capable of one\nclay becoming measurable.\nNow, it is of the essence of mental things that they do\nnot lend themselves to measurement. The first movement\nof modern science was bound then to be to find out whether\nit was not possible to substitute for the phenomena of the\nmind, phenomena which are measurable, and which could be\ntheir equivalent. We see, as a fact, that consciousness is\nbound in some way or other to a brain. So modern science\nseized upon the brain, took hold of the cerebral fact,\u2014the\nnature of which, indeed, we do not know, but we do know that\nit must finally resolve itself into movements of molecules\nand atoms, that is to say, into facts relevant to mathematics,\n\u2014and determined to consider the cerebral as the ecpiivalent\nof the mental. All our mental science, all our metaphysics,\nfrom the seventeenth century until the present day, is pene-\ntrated with the idea of this equivalence. We speak of thought\nand of the brain indifferently ; either we consider the mental\na simple \" epiphenomenon \" of the cerebral, as materialism\ndoes, or we put the mental and the cerebral on the same level,\nregardhig them as two translations, in different languages,\nof the same original. In short, the hypothesis that there\nis a strict parallelism between the cerebral and the mental\nappears eminently scientific. Instinctively, philosophy and\nscience tend to cast aside whatever would contradict this\nhypothesis or fit ill with it. And this at first sight appears\nto be the case with the facts which \" psychical research\n\"\ndeals with, or at least it might be so with a good number\nof them.\nWell, the moment has come to consider closely this hypo-\n\f16G Professor Henri Bergson. [part\nthesis, and to see what it is worth. I will not insist on the\ndifficulties, the theoretical absurdities, which it raises. I have\nshown elsewhere that, taken literally, it is a self-contradiction.\nI add that, prima facie, it is contrary to all likelihood that\nnature has indulged in the luxury of repeating purely and\nsimply in the language of consciousness what the cerebral\ncortex accomplishes in the form of atomic or molecular move-\nment. A consciousness which is only a duplicate, which does\nnot intervene actively, would doubtless have long since dis-\nappeared from the universe, supposing it had ever been pro-\nduced. Do we not see that our actions tend to become un-\nconscious in the measure and degree that habit renders them\nmechanical ? But I will not insist on these theoretical con-\nsiderations. What I claim is that the facts, looked at without\nany prepossession, neither confirm nor even suggest the\nhypothesis of parallelism.\nThere is one function of thought, indeed,\u2014one only,\u2014that\nexperience has been able to prove is localised in a certain\nregion of the brain : I refer to memory, and more particularly\nto the memory of words. We have not the least reason to\nsuppose that judgment, or reasoning, or any other faculty\nof thought, in the strict sense of the word, is attached to\nsuch or such determinate cerebral processes. But maladies\nthat affect the memory of words, or, as they are called, cases\nof aphasia, on the contrary do correspond with definite lesions\nof certain cerebral convolutions : so that it has been thought\npossible to consider memory as localised in the brain, and\nthe visual, auditory and motor recollections of words as de-\nposited inside the cortex,\u2014veritable photographic plates which\npreserve old luminous impressions, veritable phonographic\ndisks which are registers of sound vibrations. If, in short,\nwe examine narrowly all the facts alleged in favour of an\nexact correspondence and of a kind of adherence of the mental\nto the cerebral life (I set aside, it goes without saying, the\ncase of sensations and movements, for the brain is certainly a\nsensori-motor organ), we see that these facts reduce them-\nselves to the phenomena of memory, and it is the localisation\nof aphasia, and that localisation alone, which seems to bring\na beginning of experimental proof to the support of the paral-\nlelist doctrine.\n\fLXVIII.] Presidential Address. 167\nNow, a more profound study of the various cases of aphasia\nshows decisively, in my opinion, the impossibility of consider-\ning the recollections as plates or as records deposited in the\nbrain, and the impossibility of admitting that it can really\nbe in the brain that recollections are preserved. I cannot\nenter here into the details of the criticism that I have made\nelsewhere of the current interpretation of aphasia, a criticism\nwhich appeared paradoxical at a time when a certain con-\nception of aphasia was accepted as a dogma, but which patho-\nlogical anatomy has itself come forward to support in these\nlast few years (I refer to the works of Professor Pierre Marie\nand of his pupils). I will confine myself to recalling to you\nmy conclusions. What appears to me to stand out clearly\nfrom an attentive study of the facts, is that the characteristic\ncerebral lesions of the various forms of aphasia do not touch\nthe recollections themselves, and consequently that there are\nnot recollections stored in such and such regions of the cerebral\ncortex, which the malady would destroy. Those lesions really\nmake the evoking of recollections impossible or difficult ;\nthey\nconcern the mechanism of recall, and that mechanism only.\nMore exactly, the function of the brain in this case is to give\nthe mind, when it has need of such or such a recollection, the\npower of obtaining from the body a certain attitude, or certain\nnascent movements, which offer to the recollection sought\nfor an appropriate frame. If the frame is there, the recol-\nlection will come of its own accord to insert itself into it.\nThe cerebral organ prepares the frame ; it does not furnish\nthe recollection. That in my view is what an attentive study\nof the maladies of word-memory proves, and it is also what\nthe psychological analysis of memory in general would lead\nus to expect.\nBut if we now examine the other functions of thought,\nthe hypothesis of a strict parallelism between the mental\nlife and the cerebral life is not at all what the facts most\nnaturally suggest to us. On the contrary, in the work\nof thought hi general, as in the particular case of memory,\nthe brain appears to us to be charged with the task of impres-\nsing on the body the movements and attitudes which act\nwhat the mind thinks, or what the circumstances invite it\nto think. I have expressed this elsewhere by saying that\n\f168 Professor Henri Bergson. [part\nthe brain is an \"organ of pantomime.\" And that is why, as\nI have also said elsewhere, \" If any one were able to look\ninside a brain in its full activity, to follow the going and\ncoming of the atoms, and to interpret all that they were\ndoing, he would doubtless know something of what was\ngoing on in the mind, but he would know very little.\nHe would know only just what can be expressed in bodily\ngestures, attitudes and movements,\u2014what the state of the\nsoul might contain of action in course of accomplishment or\nsimply nascent ; the rest would escape him. As regards the\nthoughts and feelings which were being unrolled within the\nconsciousness, he would be in the situation of a spectator\nseeing distinctly all that the actors were doing on the stage,\nbut not hearing a word of what they were saying.\" Or yet\nagain, he would be like a person who could only know a sym-\nphony by the movements of the conductor directing the\norchestra. Indeed, the cerebral phenomena are to the mental\nlife just what the gestures of the conductor are to the sym-\nphony : they outline the motor articulations, they do nothing\nelse. In other words, we should find nothing of the operations\nof the mind, properly speaking, inside the brain. Except its\nsensorial functions, the brain has no other part than to play\nthe mental life.\nI recognise, however, that this \" pantomime \" is of primary\nimportance. It is by it that we insert ourselves in reality,\nthat we adapt ourselves to it, that we respond to the call of\ncircumstances by appropriate actions. If consciousness is\nnot a function of the brain, at least the brain maintains con-\nsciousness fixed on the world in which we live ; it is the organ\nof attention to life. That is why a cerebral modification,\neven a slight one,\u2014a passing intoxication by alcohol or opium,\nfor example, (all the more a lasting intoxication like those\nwhich no doubt most often cause insanity,) may involve a\ncomplete perturbation of the mental life. It is not that the\nmind is there directly affected. It is not necessary to believe,\nas we often do, that the poison has sought out such or such\na mechanism in the cerebral cortex which is the material\naspect of reasoning, that it has deranged this mechanism,\nand that it is on that account that the patient raves. But\nthe effect of the lesion is that the mechanism is thrown out\n\fLXVIII.] Presidential Address.\nof gear, and thought can no longer insert itself exactly in\nthings. An insane person, suffering from the delusion that\nhe is being persecuted, can still reason very logically ; but\nhis reasoning is out of line with reality, outside reality,\u2014as\nwe reason in a dream. To direct our thought towards action,\nto bring it to prepare the act that the circumstances call\nfor,\u2014it is for this that our brain is formed.\nBut in doing this it canalises, and also it limits, the life\nof the mind. It prevents us from turning our eyes to right\nand left of us, and it prevents us also as far as possible from\nturning to look back ; it would have us look right before us in\nthe direction in which we have to go. Is this not already clear\nin the operation of memory of which we have just spoken ?\nMany facts seem to indicate that the past is preserved even\ndown to its slightest details, and that there is no real forgetting.\nYou know it is related that persons resuscitated after drown-\ning or hanging declare that in some few seconds they had\nthe panoramic vision of the totality of their past life. I\ncould cite other examples, for the asphyxia has nothing to\ndo with the phenomenon, although it has been said that it\nhas. An Alpine climber slipping on a precipice, a soldier\nround whom all at once a hail of bullets falls, will sometimes\nhave the same vision.\nThe truth is our whole past is there always, and to perceive\nit we have but to look back ;\nonly, we cannot and we must\nnot look back. We must not, because our end is to live, to\nact ; and life and action look forward. We cannot, because\nthe cerebral mechanism is fashioned to this work,\u2014to mark\nfrom us the past, to let at each moment only that pass\nthrough which can throw light on the present situation and\nfavour our action : it is by this very obscuring of all our\nrecollections, except only that which is of interest and which\nour body already outlines by its \" pantomime,\" that it recalls\nthis useful recollection. Now should the attention to life\ngrow weak for a moment (I do not mean voluntary attention,\nthat which depends on the individual, but an attention im-\nposed on the normal man, what may be called \" racial atten-\ntion \") then the mind which has of force been kept till then\nlooking forward, lets go the tension and by that turns itself\nto look back ; the totality of its past appears to it. The\n\f170 Professor Henri Bergson. [part\npanoramic vision of the past is due, then, to a sudden\ndisinterestedness of life produced in certain cases by the\nmenace of a sudden death. Until then the brain, so far\nas it is the organ of memory, has been keeping the atten-\ntion fixed on life, \u2014narrowing usefully the field of mental\nvision.\nBut what I say of memory is equally true of perception.\nI will not enter here into the details of a proof that I have\ngiven elsewhere. It will be enough if I repeat that every-\nthing becomes obscure and even incomprehensible if we regard\nthe cerebral centres as organs capable of transforming material\nvibrations into conscious states ;\nthat, on the contrary, all\nbecomes clear if we see in those centres (and in the sensory\nnerve-endings with which they are connected) instruments\nof selection charged with choosing, in the immense field of\nour virtual perceptions, those which are to be actualised.\nLeibniz said that each monad, and therefore a fortiori each\nof those monads that he called spirits, carries within it the\nconscious or unconscious representation of the totality of\nthings. I should not go so far ; but I think that we perceive\nvirtually many more things than we perceive actually, and\nthat here once more the part that our body plays is that of\nshutting out from the field of our consciousness all that is\nof no practical interest to us, all that does not lend itself to\nour action. The sense organs, the sensory nerves, the cere-\nbral centres, canalise then the influences from without, and\nthus mark the various directions in which our own influence\ncan be exercised. But in doing so they narrow the field of\nour vision of the present, just as the cerebral mechanisms\nof memory limit our vision of the past. Now, just as\ncertain useless memories, or \" dream \" memories, may slip\ninto the field of consciousness, availing themselves of a moment\nof inattention to life, may there not be around our normal\nperception, a fringe of perceptions, most often unconscious,\nbut all ready to enter into consciousness, and in fact entering\nin in certain exceptional cases or in certain predisposed sub-\njects 1 If there are perceptions of this kind, it is not only\npsychology in the strict meaning of the term that they con-\ncern ;\nthey are facts with which \" psychical research \" could\nand ought to concern itself.\n\fLXV1II.] Presidential Address. 171\nLet us not forget, moreover, that it is space that creates\nthe sharp divisions, the exact distinctions. Our bodies are\nexternal to one another in space ; and our minds, in so far\nas they are attached to those bodies, are external to one an-\nother. But if they are attached to the body only by a part\nof themselves, we may conjecture that for the remainder of\nthem there is not also this sharp separation. Far am I from\nthinking that personality is a simple appearance, an ephemeral\nreality, or a dependence on cerebral activity ! But yet it\nis very possible that between various personalities there\nare continually taking place changes, analogous to the pheno-\nmena of endosmosis. If such endosmosis exists, we can fore-\nsee that nature will have taken every precaution to neutralise\nits effect, and that certain mechanisms must be specially\ncharged with the duty of throwing back into the unconscious\nthe presentations so provoked, for they would be very em-\nbarrassing in everyday life. One or another of these presenta-\ntions might yet, however, at times pass through as contraband,\nespecially if the inhibiting mechanisms were functioning badly ;\nand these again would be facts with which \"psychical research\n\"\nwould be concerned.\nThe more we become accustomed to this idea of a con-\nsciousness which overflows the organism, the more natural\nand probable we find the hypothesis that the soul survives\nthe body. Were, indeed, the mental moulded exactly on to\nthe cerebral, were there nothing more in a human conscious-\nness than what could be read in a human brain, we might\nhave to admit that consciousness must share the fate of the\nbody and die with it. But if the facts, studied without any\nprepossessions, lead us on the contrary to regard the mental\nlife as much more vast than the cerebral life, survival\nbecomes so probable that the burden of proof comes to lie\non him who denies it rather than on him who affirms it ;\nfor,\nas I have said elsewhere, \" the one and only reason we can\nhave for believing in an extinction of consciousness after\ndeath is that we see the body become disorganised ; and this\nreason has no longer any value, if the independence, however\npartial, of consciousness in regard to the body is also a fact\nof experience.\"\nSuch, briefly stated, are the conclusions to which an im-\n\f172 Professor Henri Bergson. [fart\npartial examination of the known facts leads me. That is\nto say, I regard the field open to psychical research as very\nvast, and even as unlimited. This new science will soon\nmake up the time lost. Mathematics goes back to the ancient\nGreeks ;\nphysics has existed now for three or four hundred\nyears ;\nchemistry dates from the eighteenth century ;\nbiology\nis nearly as old ; but psychology dates from yesterday, and\npsychical research is almost contemporary.\nMust we regret the time lost ? I have sometimes asked\nmyself what would have happened if modern science, instead\nof setting out from mathematics to turn its direction towards\nmechanics, physics, and chemistry, instead of bringing all its\nforces to converge on the study of matter, had begun by the\nconsideration of mind,\u2014if Kepler, Galileo, and Newton, for\nexample, had been psychologists.\nWe should certainly have had a psychology of which to-day\nwe can form no idea, any more than before Galileo we could\nhave imagined what our physics would be : a psychology\nthat probably would have been to our present psychology\nwhat our physics is to that of Aristotle. Foreign to every\nmechanistic idea, not even conceiving the possibility of such\nan explanation, science would have enquired into, instead of\ndismissing a priori, facts such as those you study ;\nperhaps\n\" psychical research would have stood out as its principal\npreoccupation.\nThe most general laws of mental activity once discovered\n(as, in fact, the tundamental laws of mechanics were dis-\ncovered), we should have passed from mind, properly so\ncalled, to life : biology would have been constituted, but a\nvitalist biology, quite different from ours, which would have\nsought, behind the sensible forms of living beings, the inward,\ninvisible force of which the sensible forms are the manifesta-\ntions. On this force we have to-day taken no hold just be-\ncause our science of mind is still in its infancy ; and this is\nwhy men of science are not wrong when they reproach vitalism\nwith being a sterile doctrine : it is sterile to-day, it will per-\nhaps not be so always, and it probably would not have been\nso now had modern science at its origin taken things at the\nother end.\nTogether with this vitalist biology there would have arisen\n\fLXVIII.] Presiden tied Address. 173\na medical practice which would have sought to remedy directly\nthe insufficiencies of the vital force ; it would have aimed at\nthe cause and not at the effects, at the centre instead of at\nthe periphery ;\nhealing by suggestion might have taken forms\nand proportions of which it is impossible for us to form the\nleast idea. So would have been founded, so would have\nbeen developed the science of mental activity.\nBut when this science, following the manifestations of mind\nstep by step from higher to lower, passing life and living\nmatter, had come at last to inert matter, it would then have\nstopped abruptly, surprised and dismayed. It would have\ntried to apply its accustomed methods to this new object\nand it would have obtained no hold on it, just as to-day the\nprocesses of calculation and measurement have no hold on\nthe things of the mind. It is matter and not mind which\nin this case would have been the realm of mystery.\nSuppose, then, that in an unknown land\u2014let us say America,\nbut an America not yet discovered by Europe\u2014there had\nbeen developed a science identical with our actual science,\nwith all its mechanical applications. It might then have\nhappened that from time to time some fishermen, venturing\nfar out from the coast of Ireland or Brittany would have seen,\nfar off on the horizon, an American ship moving at full speed\nagainst the wind,\u2014a steamship, let us say. They would have\ncome and told what they had seen. Would they have been\nbelieved ? Probably not. They would have been mistrusted\njust in proportion as those to whom they told the tale were\nlearned and imbued with a science which would have been\npsychological in direction, the reverse of physics and mechanics.\nAnd it would have been necessary to constitute a Society like\nyours\u2014but in this case a Society for Physical Research\n\u2014\nwhich would call witnesses before it, judge and criticise their\ntales, and establish the authenticity of the \"Apparitions \" of\nsteamboats. And then, as this Society would have been able\nfor the moment to use only this historical or critical method,\nit would not have been able to overcome the scepticism of\nthose who would have challenged it\u2014since it believed in\nthe existence of these miraculous boats\u2014to construct one and\nmake it work.\nThis is a dream in which I indulge at times. But whenever\nM\n\f174 Professor Henri Bergson. [part\nI do so, quickly indeed I wake from it and say to myself :\nno, it was neither possible nor desirable that the human mind\nshould have followed that direction. It was not possible,\nbecause mathematical science was already in existence at the\ndawn of the modern era, and it was therefore necessary to\nbegin by drawing from it what it had to give for our know-\nledge of the world in which we live : we do not let go the\nprey to grasp what may be only a shadow. But supposing\nit had been possible, it was not desirable, even for psycho-\nlogical science itself, that the human mind should have applied\nitself first of all to it. For though without doubt, had there\nbeen expended on psychological science the amount of work,\nof talent and of genius, which has been consecrated to the\nsciences of matter, the knowledge of mind would have been\npushed very far ;\nyet something would have been always\nlacking, something of inestimable price and without which\nall the rest would lose much of its value : the precision, the\nexactness, the anxiety for proof, the habit of distinguishing\nbetween what is simply possible or probable and what is\ncertain.\nDo not think that these are qualities natural to intelligence.\nHumanity did without them for a very long time ;\nthey would\nperhaps never have appeared in the world at all had there\nnot existed formerly a small people in a corner of Greece\nfor whom nearly so was not enough and who invented pre-\ncision. Mathematics\u2014that creation of the Greek genius\n\u2014\nwas it here the effect or the cause ? I do not know ; but\nundoubtedly it is by mathematics that the need of proof\nhas been passed on from intellect to intellect, taking more\nand more place in the human mind as mathematical science,\nthrough mechanics, has embraced an ever greater number\nof the phenomena of matter.\nThe habit of bringing to the study of concrete reality the\nsame requirements of precision, of exactness, of certitude,\nwhich are characteristic of the mathematical mind is, there-\nfore, a habit we owe to the sciences of matter and that we\nshould never have had without them. That is why science,\nhad it been applied in the first instance to the things of mind,\nwould probably have remained uncertain and vague, how-\never far it might have advanced ; it would, perhaps, never\n\fLXVIII.] Presidential Address. 175\nhave distinguished between what is simply plausible and what\nmust be definitely accepted. But to-day that, thanks to the\nsciences of matter, we know how to make that distinction\nand possess all the qualities of mind that it implies, we can\nadventure without fear into the scarcely explored domain of\npsychological realities. Let us advance therein with a prudent\nboldness, disencumbering ourselves of the bad metaphysics\nwhich cramps our movements, and the science of mind will\nyield results which will surpass all our hopes.\nM 2\n\f170 Count Perovsly-Pelrovo-Solovovo. [part\nSUPPLEMENT.\nREVIEW.\nPersonal Experiences in Spiritualism (including the official account\nand record of the American Palladino seances). By Hereward\nCarrington. (T. Werner Laurie, Ltd., Clifford's Inn, London,\nn.d. Pp. 274. Price, 7s. 6d. net.)\nThat indefatigable enquirer, Mr. Hereward Carrington, has given\npsychical researchers another valuable work. Like a former book\nby the same author, The Physical Phenomena of Spiritualism,,\nfraudulent and genuine, it falls into two parts. Part I. deals with the\nauthor's personal experiences in the domain of physical \" medium-\nship \" with mediums other than Eusapia Palladino ; Part II. deals\nexclusively with the latter. The results recorded by the author\nin Part II. are chiefly positive ; in Part I. \u2014with one doubtful ex-\nception\u2014exclusively negative.\nThe. following is a brief summary of the cases and experiments\ndescribed in Part I. :\n(Pp. 2-19.) The Windsor (Nova Scotia) Poltergeist. A palp-\nable fraud and easily proved to have been such. Trickery con-\nfessed without hesitation by all the persons concerned, with the\nexception of Judge X. of the Probate Court, who was the first to\nreveal the case to the world at large, and who refused to believe\nin trickery, even after Mr. Carrington had sent him his report\nfully stating the facts. Of course, such incidents are familiar\nto us.\n(Pp. 20-45.) Experiments in the Lily Dale camp. Fraud\nthroughout at sittings with Norman (\"spirit-photography\" and\nslate-writing), Mrs. M'Coy and Mrs. Pemberton (\" trumpet-\nmediums \"), Joseph Jonson, Mrs. Moss and Nichols, materialising\nmediums. Note this interesting remark in connection with an\nincident at a materialisation seance :\n\" The curtains were pulled aside and I [Mr. Carrington] put\n\fLXVIII.] Review. 177\nmy face close to the opening, since it was so dark I could see nothing.\nAnd there in the dim twilight of that seance room I beheld one\nof the most ghastly, most truly terrifying faces I have ever seen.\n... I regarded the face intently and it was gradually withdrawn\ninto the shadow of the cabinet, and the curtains pulled over it.\n\/ am certain that, had I been in an excited and unbalanced frame\nof mind at that moment, I should have sworn that the face actually\nmelted, away as I looked at it. ... I can now quite easily see how\ninvestigators can swear to the melting away of a face before their\neyes after my own experience.\" (Pp. 31, 32.)\nSome space is then devoted to Keeler's slate-writings, which\nMr. Carrington feels bound to admit \" are the most puzzling pheno-\nmena of their kind \" he has \" ever witnessed, and justly bear out\nthe contention that Keeler is far and away the cleverest slate-\nwriting medium in America \"\n(p. 35). Subsequently, however,\nMr. Carrington obtained proof of his trickery also (substitution\nof slates and pellets). Analysis of the contents of his slate-writing\nmessages at any rate shows that he\u2014or his \" guides \"\u2014will\ntake up any hint dropped by the sitter whether corresponding\nwith actual fact or not. For the sake of impartiality it should\nbe noted, however, that Mr. Carrington confesses he is \" quite\nunable to explain many stories which have been told \" him \" by\napparently good observers of Keeler's slate-writing.\" \"All that\nI can say is that my own sittings were certainly fraudulent, that\ncompetent investigators unite in thinking his mediumship fraudu-\nlent, and that he has been seen resorting to trickery on several\noccasions \"\n(p. 48). I think this will be enough ground on which\nto base an opinion.\nPp. 57-69 are devoted to \" phenomena witnessed in private\ncircles\n\"\u2014with equally unsatisfactory results. The following re-\nmarks, however, are curious :\n\"It is probable that most striking and peculiar manifestations\nhave been witnessed in this maimer, such strange phenomena\nindeed that I cannot relate them in this place for fear of ridicule.\nNo one knows precisely what takes place in certain spiritualistic\ngatherings ; but I am inclined to believe that some very strange\nthings happen at such times\u2014phenomena which even the average\nspiritualist is unaware of. But this is only an intuition, for which\nI can offer no proof \"\n(p. 57).\nI do not much believe in \"intuition,\" and I think such remarks\n\f178 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.

The\noccurrences in question happened in 1878 and 1879. They formed\nthe subject of a book by Mr. Walter Hubbell, now out of print,\nbearing this title. In 1908 Mr. Hubbell revisited Amherst and\nobtained from the surviving citizens of the town a document bear-\ning sixteen signatures, \" which certainly has some historical value\nand seems to support the authenticity of the phenomena to a great\nextent \"\n(p. 103). Mr. Carrington also collected additional in-\nformation in the shape of personal interviews with the \"medium,\"\nEsther Cox (still living), and her sister, Mrs. Teed. He seems\non the whole to have been favourably impressed, though he cannot\nhelp remarking (p. 120) :\n\" It may be objected to all this, of course, that I give the con-\nfirmatory evidence of only one person and that person the sister\nof the medium, one who would naturally wish to shield her younger\nsister against all charges of fraud or imposture.\"\nI confess I think the objection a serious one. Still the case is\ninteresting ; and the. thanks of all \" psychical researchers \" are\ndue to Messrs. Hubbell and Carrington for having done so much\nto improve the evidence. IF ever \" Poltergeist phenomena \" are\nfinally acknowledged to be a \" fact in nature,\" \" the great\nAmherst mystery\" may certainly fairly claim to be a good speci-\nmen of it. It all depends on the \" IF \" !\nPart II. of the book deals with Eusapia's American seances.\nExtracts from the accounts of some twenty-seven sittings are\ngiven, many, in fact most, of these accounts being stenographic.\nSome of the incidents described look interesting, and this obser-\n\fLXVIII.] Review. 179\nvation applies chiefly to the table-levitations. But on the whole\nthe impression produced on the reader's mind is of the vaguest\npossible kind. I do not even specially refer to the undoubted\nfact of Eusapia having been repeatedly caught hi the act of de-\nception. No ; but the character of the performances is unfor-\ntunately such that the question of genuineness does not move\none inch further towards solution. And this is especially true\nhi regard to the kind of control admitted. Conditions of control\nagain and again found to be unsatisfactory and unlikely ever to settle\nthe question are used throughout. And the margin of difference\nbetween the probably fraudulent and the possibly genuine is so\nnarrow as to grow quite imperceptible. So one finally asks\noneself: Is it possible that \"phenomena\" so strikingly alike are\ndue to causes so utterly different ?\nIn a short paper I contributed some two or three years ago on\nmy personal experiments with Eusapia hi Naples (S.P.R. Proceed-\nings, Part LXIL, pp. 59-63), I called special attention to the \" cabi-\nnet phenomena \" of the famous medium from the point of view\nof the unsatisfactoriness of the general conditions of control. Here\nI said \" matters ought to be seriously mended before we investi-\ngate them further.\" And I am still of this opinion. The hand\ncontrol Eusapia usually admits when \" cabmet \" phenomena\noccur \" is practicaUy non-existent.\" \" She throws every obstacle\nin the way of this control. . . . She constantly changes the re-\nspective position of her limbs\u2014both feet and hands. The latter\nespecially are a regular perpetuum mobile. Now this circumstance\nis extremely important, for, as the conditions of control are per-\npetually and ceaselessly changing, illusions of memory as to the\nexact conditions under which something occurred are eminently\napt to spring up.\"\nI do not even think that the presence of a shorthand writer\nwill always eliminate this very important source of error.\nApart from this we have some evidence\u2014scanty evidence, it\nis true, but which ought not to be altogether neglected\u2014tending\nto show that \" mediums \" are occasionally able to induce in the\nperson controlling them (in one at a time only, I thhik) something\nlike a negative tactile illusion or hallucination, which enables them\nto liberate one hand for a few seconds without the \" controller\n\"\nbecoming aware of the circumstance. I refer especially to my\nwife's account prhited in the same number of the Proceedings,\n\fISO Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\npp. 05-07, and, of course, to my numerous experiments in \" chair-\nthreading \" with the late Sambor. But if so, it is plain that only\nthose of Eusapia's cabinet phenomena should \" count \" in which\nboth her hands are visible. Are there many such on record ?\nYes, I know there are ; but were the medium's feet always satis-\nfactorily controlled on such occasions ? On p. 177 of his new\nwork, speaking of seance xv. ;\nMr. Carrington says :\n\" The greatest care was exercised in the control ;\nyet several\nstriking phenomena occurred. Of these perhaps the most note-\nworthy were the series of touches which occurred ... on both\ncontrollers at the same time, when both Eusapia's hands were held\nby the right controller.'''\nMr. Carrington italicises. I will also italicise :\nHow were the medium's feet controlled at the time ? And what\nevidence is there that she did not -produce these touches with her foot ?\nWe want also more precise details about the alleged simultaneity\nof these touches.\nIn view of these general remarks Mi'. Carrington will, I hope,\nexcuse my declining to discuss in detail the evidence he brings\nforward for the genuineness of Eusapia's American sittings. I\nconsider that such evidence is hi her case vitiated ab ovo. I am\nspeaking at least of the \" cabinet phenomena.\" As for the table\nlevitations, I have already mentioned that they seem to me some-\ntimes striking and deserving in general of renewed investigation,\nand this in spite of the crushing exposure in this domain also which\nfell to the lot of poor E. P. in the United States.\nIn a \" Note on the sittings held at Columbia University \"\n(pp.\n210-222), Mr*. Carrington blames the learned investigators for not\ncarrying out a series of scientific tests planned by himself and\nProfessors Wood and Trowbridge. Seeing, however, that, accord-\ning to Mr. Carrington, these seances \" were almost entirely blank,\nthe fourth being of such a nature as to leave on the mind of Pro-\nfessor Wilson the strongest possible impression of fraud \"\n(p. 220),\nand hi view on the other hand of E. P.'s well-known dislike to\nthe use of any paraphernalia not previously employed by her at\nthe sittings \u2014to her misoneism hi short (to use the late Professor\nLombroso's term)\u2014such barrenness of results, nay, even such\nabstention on the part of the American scientists, does not at all\nastonish me. Mr. Carrington asks :\n\" When such elaborate\nprecautions had been made, how was it that no new experiments\n\fLXVIII.] Review. 181\nwere tried ? How was it that not one of the means we had devised\n. . . was actually employed and put into execution ? . . . The\nanswer to these questions has never been forthcoming.\"\u2014Well,\nMr. Carrington, I have just ventured to suggest one.\nChapter XII. (222-256) contains an elaborate \" Theoretical dis-\ncussion \" which would be profoundly interesting and instructive,\nIF (again !) we could but be sure that the phenomena are genuine !\nIt is true that the author assumes \" that their genuine character\nis proved by the records themselves.\" Well and good. It is\ncertainly a very remarkable and instructive fact that, after all\nthat has happened since the Naples seances of 1908, Mr. Carring-\nton should still so strongly adhere to his belief in the genuineness\nof Eusapia. His opinion is entitled to the greatest consideration\nand respect. But I know many psychical researchers who, with-\nout being even now a priori prejudiced against \" physical pheno-\nmena,\" will think it very hard to follow him.\nLet us look through a very interesting chapter nevertheless.\nOn p. 225 Mr. Carrington says that he was inclined to believe at\nfirst that some of the \" phenomena \" were the direct result of the\nmedium's own will. Now he seems to think on the contrary that\n\" she cannot control them, far less ensure their success \"\n(p. 226).\n\" The impression made upon the majority of the sitters is that\nthe phenomena are due to some unrecognised force emanating\nfrom the body of the medium, and that they are not spiritistic\nin character \"\n(p. 227). On the other hand, \" it must be acknow-\nledged that the longer any one group of experimenters sits with\nEusapia, and the more satisfactory the conditions, the more start-\nling do the phenomena become and the more indicative of an\nexternal intelligence.\" On the whole \"we have not advanced at all\nin the comprehension of the phenomena \"\n(p. 229) : a satisfactory\nconclusion !\nOn p. 230 the author discusses the question why, \" when the\nsitters on both sides of Eusapia are touched simultaneously, they\nare touched in about the same place.\" The explanation Mr.\nCarrington suggests is the following :\n\" Both sides of the medium's body are practically alike in their\nanatomical structure. If, therefore, there be an externalisation\nof vital force, it seems probable that this externalisation would\ntake place from both sides of the body {i.e. from the same nerve\nends on both sides) simultaneously, because of the correspondence\n\f182 Count Perovsky-Pelrovo- Solovovo. [part\nand sympathy between the two sides. If a nervous current origi-\nnated in the brain or spinal cord, and Avas shot outward to the\nperiphery, it would pass along the nerve tracts on both sides, and\n(granting that externalisation takes place at all) would consequently\nbe externalised on both sides in the same manner and about at\nthe same time. Upon such a theory, one wonders why simultaneous\ntouchings are not recorded more frequently, and it must be admitted\nthey are comparatively rarer (The italics are mine.)\nI confess I have another explanation to offer, but perhaps some\npeople will think it a too simple one !\nOn p. 234 the question, \" Why use a cabinet at all %\n\" is dis-\ncussed. Mi'. Carrmgton states \" frankly \" (why does he require\nparticular frankness in this case?) that \"a cabinet is generally\nemployed by mediums to facilitate fraud.\" But with Eusapia\nthe case is different :\n\" she does not sit inside the cabinet, but, on\nthe contrary, outside\u2014a foot or more distant from the curtains\nbehind her, held hand and foot [?], and there is no apparent\ncontact or connection between her and the cabinet during a large\nportion of the seance.\"\nAgainst such a representation I feel bound to protest. And I\nhope the reader will not object to my quoting again what I wrote\non this very subject some years ago. In discussing M. Courtier's\nreport in Vol. XXIII. of our Proceedings (p. 588) I said :\n\" To return to Eusapia : a light seance of hers with the curtain\nis, I think, evidentially at least equivalent to a totally dark seance.\nWhen first introduced this curtain was supposed to serve a reason-\nable purpose : it would ensure for part of the room the necessary\ncondition of darkness whilst allowing the medium to remain in\nfull view. As a matter of fact it simply complicates matters,\nhampers investigation, and generally speaking plays a part which\n\u2014with all due respect to the medium\u2014I may be permitted to\ncall simply disreputable !\n\"\nAnd again in a foot-note to the same page :\n\" It has in particular a certain way of being thrown over the\ntable and covering the medium's hands which may very well serve\na certain purpose, only it will not be the purpose of scientific re-\nsearch. When its lower end is thus spread over E. P.'s hands\nshe will still keep on moving them, at times showing one or both,\nat times concealing them again. And while this is going on,\n'\nphenomena '\nwill occur now and then, and it requires a certain\n\fLXVIII.] Review. 183\nstraining of attention to note whether both hands were visible\nsimultaneously with such and such '\nmanifestations '\nor not. At\ntimes a hand will also appear between the two halves of the cur-\ntain ; and as the result of all this hand-moving the sitters may\nvery easily be led to believe that they saw all the three hands at\nonce, whilst in fact they did not. At some sittings with E. P.\nin St. Petersburg in the spring of 1898 I specially noticed that\nthis was just the case ; and yet at least one other sitter was found\nto believe and assert the contrary, until I positively assured him\nthat he was mistaken. In the present instance, therefore, light\nengenders an error for which there Mould have been no room in\nthe dark.\"\nTo this view I still emphatically adhere.\nOn pp. 235-240 Mr. Carrmgton deals with \" the second great\nobjection to these phenomena \"\u2014darkness. Here I agree with\nhim a good deal. I do not think that, provided that all other\nconditions are eminently satisfactory, the fact of a seance taking\nplace hi the dark is an insuperable objection. No : I even prefer\nan honestly dark seance to some aoi-discmt \"light\" ones. For\nI greatly value unpretentiousness. Let us have even totally dark\nsittings, provided all the other conditions are strict \" test-con-\nditions \" (I mean this seriously) ; and wait for a real medium to\nturn up. I am afraid we shall have to wait a long time.\nThe fact is that absence of light is by no means the only con-\ndition demanded by mediums ; there are many others and\n\u2014\nstrange to say\u2014all these conditions are invariably such as to facili-\ntate fraud. If after all genuine phenomena exist, such a coinci-\ndence is nevertheless extremely unfortunate and extraordinary.\nOn p. 247 Mr. Carrington describes the following incident which\nhe thinks \" most instructive \" :\n\" The question of '\ncontrol '\nhad come up, and Eusapia was\nprotesting that her controllers did not hold her securely enough.\nShe said in effect :\n'\nDo hold me securely, do hold me tightly, be-\ncause, if you don't, I am liable to do these things niyself ; I have\na tendency to do them, and I want you to prevent that tendency\nfrom becoming active and permitting me to produce these pheno-\nmena. I beg of you, therefore, to control me securely, for I warn\nyou that, if you do not, I am likely to perform certain actions\nautomatically, when in trance, which will be interpreted as fraudu\nlent.' I think this statement is most significant.\"\n\f184 Count Perovsky-Petrbvq- Solovovo. [part\nHas it never occurred to Mr. Carrington that it might have\noccurred to E. P.\u2014who is undoubtedly a very intelligent and\nshrewd woman\u2014that such statements of hers, if supposed by her\nhearers to have been made in all earnestness, might prove very useful\nin the way of exonerating her from suspicions of conscious fraud ?\nThere is nothing very improbable in such a supposition.\nMr. Carrington notes that \" as regards personal idiosyncrasies,\nit may be said that ha many respects Eusapia is entirely different\nfrom almost every other medium. . . . For example, most mediums\ncan obtain better results for an individual who is more or less\n'\nmediumistic '\nor '\npsychic' Eusapia does not.\" \" Again it is\nusually believed that better results can be obtained for women\nthan for men . . . but Eusapia says that in her case it makes\nno difference at all \"\n(pp. 249, 250). We have a saying in Russian\nwhich runs thus :\n\" Vsiakiy molodetz\u2014na svoi obrazetz,\" which may\nbe translated somewhat as follows :\n\" Every fellow acts hi his\nown fashion \" ; and this saying will fit the mediumistic tribe admir-\nably. The variety of the \" conditions \" supposed to be required\nby the \" phenomena \" almost surpasses the variety of the pheno-\nmena themselves ! Conditions alleged to be absolutely necessary\nin one case are altogether wanting hi another and only partly\npresent hi a third one. And yet in all this boundless variety one\nuniform feature is, it is true, conspicuously present throughout :\nthe conditions are such as the medium, not the sitter, desires.\nMi'. Carrington's book ends with an Appendix devoted to the\n\" need of a psychical laboratory.\"\nIt begins, on the other hand, with a Preface containing a quota-\ntion from Count [sic] Aksakoff's Afiimism and Spiritism, which\nmay appropriately close this review. Says M. Aksakoff (pp. xi-xii):\n\" In the decline of life I ask myself sometimes, '\nHave I in truth\ndone well to have devoted so much time and toil and money to\nthe study and the publication of facts in this domain ? Have\nI not struck into a blind road ? \u2014followed an illusive hope ? Have\nI not wasted my experience, with no result to justify all my pains ?\n'\nYet always I seem to hear the same reply :\n'\nA life on earth can\nhave no higher aspiration than to demonstrate the transcendental\nnature of man's behig\u2014to prove him called to a destiny loftier\nthan the phenomenal existence he knows.' I cannot, then, regret\nthat I have devoted my whole life to the pursuance of this aim ;\nalthough it be by methods which science shuns and spurns\u2014methods\n\fLXVIII.] Review. 185\nwhich I hold far trustier than any other which science has to show.\nAnd if it be in the end my lot to have laid one stone to that temple\nof the Spirit, upbuilt from century to century by men of true heart,\nthis will be the highest and the only recompense which ever I\nstrove to gam.\"\nMr. Carrington seems to agree entirely with this optimistic\nattitude. May I add that I do so but partially ? Certainly,\nthe more I advance hi age, the more I am inclined to think that\nthe road is blind indeed and the hope illusive. I wish I had spent\nthe energy I have devoted to investigation hi the domain of\n(Spiritism on some altogether different aim. I think the results\nmight have been somewhat more fruitful.\nBut such reflections are, perhaps, inappropriate hi a review\ndealing with Psychical Research : I had therefore better stop,\nnot, however, without first thanking Mr. Carrington for the pleasure\na perusal of his very interesting work has afforded me.\nPerovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.\n\f186 John E.

Evidently those successful experiments\nneed repetition under the control of the psychological labora-\ntory.\nThe object of the following experimentation was (1) to\nfurther test Richet's supposition of a common \" suggestion\nmentale,\" or to find a \" norm \" for normal people, (2) to\nacquire in the course of experimentation statistical material\nsuitable for establishing a \" practical \" probability with which\nto check the application of theoretical probability to experi-\nmental results, (3) to rigorously control the experimentation\nto the end of discovering among regularly varied factors the\nconditions of success, and (4) to analyse the subjective pro-\ncesses to the end of determining what elements of experience\ncontribute to certainty in making a guess, and, in the case\nof success, of learning if the impression upon which a judgment\nis based is in the same sense-mode as that entertained in the\nmind of the experimenter.\nThree series of guessing, aggregating 5000 experiments,\nwere made.\nGeneral Method.\nThe reagent sat comfortably with his back to the experi-\nmenter and closed his eyes to avoid visual distraction during\nthe interval of impression ; after each experiment he recorded\nhis guess, and noted introspections in a tabulated form under\nthe following headings : (1) Was the mind in a thoroughly\nreceptive mood ? (2) Imagery : (a) Kind, (b) Vividness (grade\nfrom A to D), (c) Temporal course (occurring at beginning,\nmiddle, end, quickly, slowly, persistent, intermittent), (d)\nSpatial attributes (to the right, left, back, front, \u2014 metres) ;\n(3) Certainty of guess : (a) Grade (from A to D, and use \" pure\nguess\"), (b) Why? (if the grade is high).\nBefore each experiment the experimenter shook a dice-box\nand determined by the spots whether the card should be\n\" imaged \" or \" not imaged,\" and if the former, in what way\n1\nPreyer, W. : Die Erkl&rung des Oedankenlesens.

From 25 to 50 guesses were made on one\nday.\nI. \" The Feeling of being Stared at.\" 1\nSome years ago Titchener 2\nfound the belief in \" the feeling\nof being stared at \" to be common in his junior classes in\nPsychology, proved it groundless in experiments in the labora-\ntory, and suggested general psychological reasons for it.\nWith students in our beginning courses in psychology the\nbelief is also common :\nWomen.

Right cases varied from 43 to 56 ;\nper cent,\nof the grand total was 50' 2, as against a probability of 50.\nThe feeling was experienced in the laboratory, and judg-\nments were delivered with five degrees of certainty (decreasing\nfrom A to \" pure guess \") over which they were distributed\nas follows :\nA B C D \" Pure Guess.\" Total.\nNumber 15 332 264 61 36 708\nPer cent.

C. S. Schiller, D.Sc.\nIt was with no little hesitation that I accepted the great\nhonour to which the Council of our Society has this year\nelected me. For I am not at all sure that a philosopher\nought to be called upon to preside over a Society which has\nscientific exploration for its aim, the more so when its researches\nare as arduous and prolonged as ours. For the philosophic\ntemper seems to be contemptuous of the minute details which\ncount for so much in science, and impatient of the slow but\nunceasing advances which constitute the normal progression\nof a science. They contrast too much with the procedure of\n\f192 F. C. S. Schiller, D.Sc. [part\nthe speculative method, with its spectacular flights, gorgeous\nguesses, and hazardous predictions, which it flatters itself\ncan be guaranteed by reasoning a priori. But the more I see\nof philosophic interventions in scientific questions, the more\nsceptical I become about their value, and the more doubtful\nwhether irrefragable proofs that a thing must be so render\nit in the least more likely that it is so in fact. The deductive\narguments from general principles, to which philosophers\nare addicted, therefore, seem to be, not only useless, but\npositively mischievous. They always assume what we none\nof us know, to wit, where the limits of the possible are laid\ndown.\nBut amid such doubts I take heart again when I think\nof the grand succession of philosophers who have presided\nover the destinies of our Society before me. Henry Sidgwick,\nWilliam James, and Henri Bergson rank with the greatest\nnames in the philosophy, not only of our day, but of all\ntime.\nAnd they have all served us nobly. Henry Sidgwick was a\nchief among our founders, our first and most essential Presi-\ndent, who nursed the Society through the perils of infancy.\nWell do I remember those days, though it is now over thirty\nyears ago, when to profess an interest in Psychical Research\nmeant to incur an imputation of insanity. We should hardly\nhave lived down the unreasoning prejudices that poisoned\nthe social atmosphere, had we not been guided so long by the\ncounsels of a man, whose genius for common-sense stood\nbetween us and almost inevitable condemnation for cranki-\nness, and whose stainless candour shielded us against attacks\nboth from within and from without in the pursuit of an enter-\nprise in which fraud and self deception are a perpetual danger.\nTo William James we owe, not only the claim which the\nsupport of the greatest psychologist of all time has given us\nupon all succeeding investigators of his science, but also the\ndiscovery of Mrs. Piper and a number of most brilliant and\ninspiring papers.\nAbout Henri Bergson, the first metaphysician who has\nradically challenged the stupid old tradition, which has come\ndown from the Eleatics, that time is unreal and change im-\npossible, I will say nothing for the moment. You must\n\flxix.] Philosophy, Science, and Psychical Research. 193\nall have read the charming Address which delighted and\ninstructed us so much last year, and I mean to take up one\nor two of his points later.\nIt is clear therefore that our Society has been most fortunate\nin its philosophers. And this is the more surprising because\none does not usually associate the patronage of scientific\nadventures with philosophers. When they are not '\nspecu-\nlating '\non their own account, they seem as a rule to play for\nsafety, and to content themselves with ex post facto\n1\nreflec-\ntion '\non the work of others. This conception has been classi-\ncally formulated in Hegel's famous comparison of philosophy\nwith the owl of Minerva, which takes flight only at nightfall. 1\nHe meant, presumably, that it loves obscurity, gets on the\nwing when the day's work is done, and pursues its prey in\nthe dark. I am afraid this is only too true of much philo-\nsophy, and it explains why men of affairs and men of science\nas heartily despise the ex post facto explanations of philoso-\nphers after the event as they suspect their a priori dogmatism\nbefore.\nBut it is not true of all philosophy, and was not true of\nthe great philosophers who have supported us, and of whom\nI may claim to be not only a successor, but also in some measure\na follower. There is another and a truer philosophy, which\nby way of contrast with the philosophy of the owl we may\ncall that of the Lark. It conceives the duty of philosophy\nto be, not a priori speculation and ex post facto reflection\nmerely, but the preliminary exploration, which heralds man's\nconquest of new realms of knowledge. So it rises above the\ncommon clods of earth and soars carolling to the sky, pointing\nout to men the upward and onward way. Or, in less poetical\nlanguage, it is possible, and at times even essential, to prepare\nthe way for science by ingenious guessing, and this is why\nso many of the successful scientific conceptions have originated\nwith philosophers. I will remind you only of Anaximander's\nanticipations of Darwin, of the Atomism of Democritus,\nof Heraclitus's discovery of the Universal Flux, of the Stoic\ndoctrine of the periodical conflagrations of stellar systems,\nof Descartes's adoption of the Mechanical Theory, of Berkeley's\nImmaterialism, of Kant's Nebular Hypothesis. There was\n1\nPreface to the Philosophy of Right, s.f.\n\f194 F. C. S. Schiller, D.Sc. [part\nnothing owlish about these guesses ; if they erred, it was\nfrom excess of daring.\nThere is lastly the philosophy of that self-sacrificing bird\nthe Pelican, which does not selfishly seclude itself in the\ncontemplation of the eternal and immutable and indifferent,\nbut tries to be useful and beneficial to men. And the Pelican\nis, I am proud to remember, the totem of my own College. 1\nBut the Pelican must follow in the wake of the Lark. For\nthere is need of Daring in intellectual, as in warlike, adventures,\nand we particularly need the spirit of the lark, if we would\nrise above our actual horizon and explore the undiscovered\ncountry.\nBut in what direction is it best worth exploring at present,\nand to what points can your attention be most usefully\ndirected ? These were, of course, questions I had to consider.\nIt seemed to me that in our present era of incipient exploration\nof the psychic terra incognita I could best serve the cause by\ndiscussing some problems of our proper logical equipment, and\nby clearing away certain metaphysical obstructions which\nbeset the minds of many. I hope however you will not be\nterrified by hearing that I am going to talk both logic and\nmetaphysics, and will not make up your minds in advance\nthat I am going to be unintelligible. Logic is, I know, uni-\nversally respected, though no one reads it ; while those who\nread metaphysics mostly do so, one feels, not to be enlightened\nso much as to have their sense of the inscrutable mystery\nof everything stimulated and augmented. We, however,\nas scientific pioneers, must go armed with a logic that we\ncan use as an instrument to cut a clear path through the wilder-\nness, and must not be afraid of bogies, metaphysical, or other-\nwise. Indeed it may be that by going ahead boldly we shall\nnot only advance our own subject but perform a notable\nservice both to metaphysics and to logic.\nLet me start, therefore, from an important and interesting\nfact to which Prof. Bergson has directed our attention.2\nThe evidence of psychic phenomena, which we collect, is\nprimarily historical, and has to be ascertained according\nto the canons used by the historian and the lawyer, rather\n1\nCorpus Christi\u2014though we also own to the owl.\n-Proc. Vol. XXVI., p. 464 f.\n\flxix.] Philosophy, Science, and Psychical Research. 195\nthan by the methods of the laboratory experimenter. Now\nthis profoundly true remark indicates the great gulf which\nexists between our procedure and that, not only of the exact,\nbut also of the experimental, sciences. For you see a historical\nevent occurs once, and is not to be repeated. History never\nrepeats itself. Julius Caesar was assassinated only once,\nand if we wish to know how, and how large precisely was\nthe rent the envious Casca made, we must get the historical\neye-witnesses to record their evidence accurately and at\nonce, and compare and criticize their several accounts. That\ntoo is essentially what we have to do with our ghost stories,\netc. If we are lucky, and get hold of the story while it is still\nfresh and the witnesses are still alive,\u2014and this, I am glad\nto note, we are being allowed to do much oftener than formerly\n\u2014we can proceed to strengthen our historical evidence by\napplying the methods of the law-courts. We can question\nour witnesses and cross-examine them to a certain extent.\nBut we cannot, as a rule, repeat the experience. We cannot\nsummon spirits from the vasty deep at will, and cinemato-\ngraph their performances, in order that if they do anything\nwe did not observe closely enough, we can make them do it\nover again slowly. In short, we can experiment not at all, or\nhardly at all. Consequently we cannot multiply our evidence\nat will, nor crush our critics by its accumulating weight.\nBut worse remains to be confessed. Our evidence does\nnot accumulate in the strict sense at all. The longer we keep\nit, the worse it gets, and that through no fault of its own.\nIt wastes insensibly away through the mere efflux of time,\nand, so far from growing greater with the growth of interest,\nour scientific capital is composed of wasting assets.\nThe reason is quite simple. The strength of our evidence\ndepended on our securing first-hand records from trustworthy\nwitnesses and getting them competently examined and criticized\nby honourable investigators. So long as our witnesses and our\ninvestigators are alive, therefore, they can confront the hostile\nsceptic in person, and will have the support of those who\nknow them and believe in them. But as the original witnesses\nand investigators pass away, their evidence inevitably under-\ngoes a serious and progressive loss in value. Coming generations\nhave nothing to go by but a paper record, and a record of its\n\f196 F. C. S. Schiller, D.Sc. [part\nrecorders. They can know neither the witnesses nor the\ninvestigators personally, and hence the value of the evidence\nmay shrink incalculably. Whoever wants to disbelieve it\nhas merely to get up and say the witnesses were liars or lunatics.\n'\nWhy don't these marvels happen now ? Certainly they\nseem weU attested ; but what if the records were biased or\nfraudulent ? Anyhow they are not up to modern scientific\nstandards.' Nor can any one refute him. At present even\nthose of us who have discovered nothing at first hand (and\ntheir numbers are regrettably large) can yet reply '\nsuch\ninsinuations are absurd ; we have known Edmund Gurney\nand Henry Sidgwick and Frederic Myers and Richard Hodgson,\nand William James, and they were all honourable men, in\nwhose integrity and intelligence we could safely put our\ntrust.' But will any one be able to feel this as strongly\n100 or 1000 years hence ? Surely we must recognize that\nhowever fully and carefully we record our cases now, it is\nsimply a question of time for them to become as inadequate\nfor scientific purposes and as unconvincing to our successors\nas the records of similar events in the past had become to us.\nIn other words we must recognize it as an intrinsic limitation\nof historical evidence that it can hardly ever be, and can\nnever remain, scientifically adequate, and that therefore\nour evidence also can never be made scientifically cogent,\nso long as it remains historical.\nWe labour, then, under a serious disability. But is it\nincurable ? The answer must be, yes and no. Yes, in so\nfar as we continue to depend on crude evidence : for the crude\nevidence is always historical, even in the sciences. All scientific\ndiscoveries are in the first place historical events. That\nNewton had the law of gravitation suggested to him by the\nfall of the apple, that he made certain calculations and pre-\ndicted the orbit of the moon, that his predictions failed at\nfirst because his data were wrong, and afterwards, when\nhe had got hold of better ones, succeeded (approximately),\nare, or are believed to be, historical facts, without which our\nlaw of gravitation would not have come into being.1\nNor\n1\nOf course if some one else than Newton had subsequently propounded the\nsame formula, there would still have been a set of historical circumstances\nconditioning the discovery.\n\flxix.] Philosophy, Science, and Psychical Research. 197\ndoes our recognition of it as an '\neternal ' truth exempt it\nfrom dependence on such facts. If it is to remain '\ntrue,'\nit needs a continuous supply of historical verifications ;\nits predictions must continue to come true and never fail.\nIf at any time a gravitating body should be observed to move\nunpredictably, a question would arise about the truth of\nNewton's law, and it might have to be amended. Even the\nbest established laws of nature, therefore, rest in fact on a\nfinite number of historical observations, and in the case of\nlaws which can be verified only with difficulty, or at long\nintervals, that number is by no means large. It takes seventy-\neight years (more or less) to verify the orbit of Halley's comet,\nand it would seem that at most abort forty reappearances of\nthis luminary are on record. The atomic weight of some\nof the rarer metals has probably not been calculated more\nthan three or four times, and finally there are whole sciences\n(like palaeontology) in which important conclusions repose\nupon single historical observations as to where a bone was\nfound in a bed. Thus the name and fame, nay the very\nexistence, of Pithecanthropus erectus, the '\nMissing Link,'\ndepend on the truthfulness and competence of Dr. Eugene\nDubois's assurance that he had found a cranium sufficiently\nnear a thigh bone for both to be attributed to the same\ncreature. In all these cases any source of error in the\nhistorical data may radically vitiate all the beliefs that are\nbuilt upon them.\nSo far then our evidence does not differ from that on which\nall science ultimately rests, and it is a mistake to imagine\nthat crude historical evidence can be dispensed with. Even\nthe sciences that predict most boldly and successfully rest\non historical evidence and individual witnesses, and depend\non confirmation by experience. Nor do the mathematical\nsciences form a real exception. For though in their case we\nseem to be free to make what assumptions we please, and to\nwork them out as consistently as we please, the only thing\nthat guarantees to our procedures any relevance or applica-\nbility to the course of real events is that we should have\nhappened to hit upon assumptions which turn out to be service-\nable idealizations of reality. However enthusiastic therefore\nwe may be about the exactness and apriority of pure\n\f198 F. C. S. Schiller, D.Sc. [part\nmathematics, we must leave the truth of applied mathematics\nessentially empirical. There is nothing in the number-system\nto secure that it shall always be supplied with things that\ncan be numbered, nothing in any geometry to guarantee a\nsupply of shapes that can be treated as if they were geometrical.\nThus it is their actual application to reality which raises the\nvalue of mathematics above that of difficult games with\nimaginary counters.\nNevertheless it is not true that the sciences are wholly\ndependent on truthful records of events. Their truths are\nhistorical, but not merely historical, and herein lies the real\ndifference between their materials and ours. This difference\nconsists essentially in the extent to which the data can be\ncontrolled. Where there is control enough to experiment,\nthere is always a possibility in theory, and usually in fact,\nof indefinitely repeating and multiplying the evidence, on\nwhich the truths of the sciences rest. If, therefore, there is\nany dispute about the evidence, it is possible to repeat the\nexperiments questioned, with special attention to the doubtful\npoints, or, better still, to devise such new and improved forms\nof them as will meet the objections urged. Thus, though the\nevidence is historical and its amount may actually be small,\nmore can be manufactured on demand, and it is therefore\nscientifically adequate.\nThe existence, therefore, of such experimental control\nrevolutionizes the logical situation. It justifies an entirely\ndifferent method of discussion and an entirely different notion\nof proof. It puts '\ndialectical '\ndisputation and logic-chopping\nout of court altogether. When a doubt arises whether a pheno-\nmenon has been correctly observed, it is no longer necessary\nto go into the pros and cons of a historical record, and to\ndispute about the honesty and competence of the observers\nwith critics who may be bitterly prejudiced for all sorts of\nreasons that are not revealed\u2014not because a good case cannot\noften be made out in their favour, but because it is no longer\nworth while. It is much simpler and more satisfactory to\nrepeat the experiments, and so to make fresh evidence. Thus\nwhen in the early days of wireless telegraphy the Marconi\nCompany first claimed to have transmitted a signal across\nthe Atlantic, and this claim was disputed, there did not arise\n\flxix.] Philosophy, Science, and Psychical Research. 199\na literary controversy as to what exactly happened on this\nparticular occasion. The company simply went on perfecting\nits apparatus until it got through so many messages of such\nimportance that it was no longer worth the captious critic's\nwhile to dispute its achievement. In short, where there is\nexperimental control the decisive appeal is to facts, and not\nto dialectical reasoning and argument, though it has taken\nmankind a long time to learn this, and some philosophers\nmay still behave like the Aristotelians who refused to look\nthrough telescopes, lest they should see the satellites of Jupiter\nrevolving round their primary and behold a visible refutation\nof their master's astronomy.\nIt follows that in Psychical Research also we should aim,\nnot so much at establishing that any particular '\nsuper-\nnormal '\nevent, say a message from the departed, did veritably\nhappen at a particular time, but at getting such a grasp of\nthe conditions of such events that they can become predictable\nand '\nnormal.' We live in a beleaguered city that is hedged\nround and beset by death : it is no great relief, even if we\ncan believe it, that from time to time a sporadic message should\nget through the blockading lines ; what we need is to be assured\nof a free line of communication with our friends without, that\nwill render our life the outpost of a larger scheme. That the\nreal '\nG.P.' or Frederic Myers communicated through Mrs.\nPiper on this occasion or that, we shall never be able to\nestablish to every one's satisfaction ; but we may perhaps learn\nso to regulate the conditions of trance, automatism, and other\nforms of so-called '\nmediumship,' that they will yield results,\nas in the natural sciences, which progressively increase in value\nand trustworthiness, until they cease to be laboratory experi-\nments, and enter into our ordinary practice and outlook upon\nlife. How in fact that is to be achieved I cannot, unfortunately,\ntell you ; for that would be the real discovery, and one of the\nmost momentous men could make. But we are far more\nlikely to make it, if we make it clear to ourselves that it is\nthe discovery to aim at.\nExperimental control similarly changes the notion of\n'\nproof.' It liberates us from the illusion, which still\nvitiates so much of the argument on both sides in Psychical\nResearch, that it is in our power or duty to contrive a single\n\f200 F. C. S. Schiller, D.Sc. [PART\nunexceptionable and final experiment or observation which\nwill constitute an absolute and coercive proof of a disputed\nbelief once and for all, and silence sceptics for ever after.\nOnce we capitulate to this logical superstition, we are not\nonly bound to reject much valuable and scientifically suggestive\nevidence that for one reason or another does not come up\nto this standard of '\nproof,' and to engage upon a wildgoose\nchase of an impossibly perfect case, but we are also committed\nto endless arguments as to whether a particular observation\ndoes or does not reach the standard. But a really experi-\nmental science does not allow its progress to be impeded in\nthis way. It says to the objector\n\u2014' you don't think our\nevidence good enough. Well, I will not dispute with you\nabout case A, which you reject ; but here are also cases B\nand C, and D, and so forth to any extent, which, though\nnot one of them is ideally perfect, are not subject to the same\nobjections as A.' Thus, by the indefinite accumulation of\nevidence, even the strongest prejudices are slowly overpowered.\nIt is possible therefore for a scieuce, i.e. a systematic inter-\npretation of a number of facts, to become certain and indisput-\nable, even though none of its constituent facts are per se\nbeyond cavil. And conversely, if a scientific investigation\nis put into a position in which its evidence is not allowed\nto accumulate, it can never be secured against cavils, and\nremains exposed for ever to attacks which experimental\ncontrol would justify it in ignoring.\nIt follows moreover that much of the criticism to which\nour evidence is subjected is mistaken and rests upon bad\nlogic. It is assumed that proof must rest upon absolute\ncertainties, and cannot accrue from a confluence of proba-\nbilities. It is then shown that no part of the evidence taken\npiecemeal is absolutely unexceptionable. It is, thereupon,\nrejected as inconclusive, and it is inferred that nothing has\nbeen proved. But this is really to imply that evidence must\nnever be allowed to accumulate, that probabilities have no\nlogical value, and that the sort of evidence on which most of\nthe sciences rely is worthless. It would clearly be inept on\nour part to acquiesce in a procedure which first requires us\nto prove scientific novelties by one single historical case,\nand then condemns us for failing in this impossible attempt.\n\flxix.] Philosophy, Science, and Psychical Research. 201\nIt is evident then that experimental control would not only\ngive us power to amass evidence to our hearts' content, but\nwould enormously improve our logical position. If we had\nsuch control, even to a slight extent, we should no longer\nneed to waste time and ingenuity in arguing with sceptics\nabout the precise weight of particular pieces of evidence or\nto strain after one single invulnerable piece de conviction.\nWe could calmly let the evidence accumulate for what it was\nworth, and devote our energies to the extension and improve-\nment of that control, convinced that in the long run it is not\npossible to deny the status of truth to knowledge which has\nshown itself to be real, by proving itself useful and by becoming\na power in the world.\nIt seems then that in Psychical Research also we cannot\nconvince others, nor in the end perhaps ourselves, that our\ndiscoveries are real, unless they conform to the type which\nthe pragmatic philosophy assigns to all genuine knowledge,\ni.e. unless they increase our power over the course of events.\nIndeed I do not know of any case which bears out more\nstrikingly the correctness of the pragmatic analysis of know-\nledge. What other case is there of alleged knowledge which\nis as ancient, as important, as passionately defended and\nattacked, as the occult and mysterious occurrences which our\nSociety has for the first time in human history essayed to\nsubject to systematic investigation ? And about what alleged\nknowledge also have disputes raged so interminably ? Why ?\nThe testimony to the genuineness of this whole realm of know-\nledge is doubted and repudiated, because those who claimed\nto possess such knowledge have never been able to show that\nit could stand the pragmatic test, that they had the pheno-\nmena under control, and that it yielded them real power.\nHence the world has never been willing to acknowledge that\nthey possessed real knowledge.\nLet me illustrate this point from a delightful book which\nexhibits a rare combination of philosophic and spiritual insight,\nProf. L. P. Jacks's All Men are Ghosts (pp. 4-7).\nTurning the tables upon us, one of his characters declares\nthat \" Ghosts who believe in the existence of human beings\noften regard them as idiots. To communicate with such\nimbeciles is to court an insult, or at least to expose the\n\f202 F. C. 8. Schiller, D.Sc. [part\ncommunicating spirit to an exhibition of revolting antics and\nlimited intelligence. From their point of view, men are a\nrace of beings whose acquaintance is not worth cultivating.\"\nBy the majority of ghosts \" belief in the existence of beings\nlike yourself is regarded as betokening a want of mental\nbalance. A ghost who should venture to assert that you,\nfor example, were real would certainly risk his reputation,\nand if he held a scientific professorship or an ecclesiastical\nappointment he would be . . . made the victim of some\npersecution. . . . The ghosts have among them a Psychical\nResearch Society which has been occupied for many years\nin investigating the reality of the inhabitants of this planet.\n\"A friend of mine, who is a Doctor of Science, and extremely\nscornful as to the existence of spirits, is actually undergoing\nexamination by the ghosts. . . . Some assert that he is a\nlow form of mental energy which has managed to get astray\nin the universe. Others declare that he is a putrid emanation\nfrom some kind of matter which science has not yet identified,\nwithout consciousness, but by no means without odour.\nThey allege that they have walked through him. ...\"\n\"By the vast majority of ghosts the proceedings of the Society\nare viewed with indifference and the claim, which is occasionally\nmade, that communication has been established with the\nbeings whom we know as men is treated with contempt. The\ncritics point to the extreme triviality of the alleged com-\nmunications from this world. They say nothing of the\nleast importance has ever come through from the human\nside, and are wont to make merry over the imbecility and\ndisjointed nonsense of the messages reported by the mediums*\nfor you must understand that there are mediums on that\nside as well as on this. Some time ago, two questions, pur-\nporting to come from this world, reached the ghosts. One\nwas '\nWhat will be the price of Midland Preferred on Jan.\n1, 1915 ?\n'\nThe other, '\nWill it be a boy or a girl ?\n'\n\"\nWhy do you laugh at these questions ? Are they not\npsychologically natural questions for us to ask, and questions\nabout what it concerns men greatly to know ? Nay, are\nthey not logically good test questions, and would not correct\nanswers to them unquestionably be convincing ? Could\nany one persist in disbelieving the genuineness of supernormal\n\flxix.] Philosophy, Science, and Psychical Research. 203\ncommunications if they conveyed information bearing so\ndirectly on his vital interests ? And if he did, should we not\nconfidently expect one who was blind to the advantages of\nsuch valuable information to be speedily eliminated by natural\nselection ? Whatever, therefore, may be the idiosyncrasies\nof individuals, the race has to be empirically-minded enough\nto believe whatever is enforced by a long course of successful\nand valuable prediction. You may convince yourselves of\nthis by an illustration taken from an ingenious tale, by Mr.\nH. G. Wells, if I remember rightly, of a race of men con-\ngenially blind, in whose midst by some freak of atavism a\nchild was born gifted with sight. Being a seer, he became\n\u2022of course a prophet ; i.e. he was able to predict, supernormally,\na vast number of events which duly came to pass. He could\nforetell to his blind fellows that if they walked on so many\nyards in a certain direction they would run into a rock or\nencounter a bull, and would of course himself avoid many\ndangers he could see approaching. At first, of course, his\nclaim to be possessed of an additional sense and a consequential\nextension of his means of knowing would be scouted, and\nfraud, coincidence, or lying be alleged in explanation of his\nfeats ; but in the end the regular success of the seer's pre-\ndictions and the superior adaptations which they rendered\npossible, i.e. the practical value of his endowment, would force\nthe reluctant blind to admit the existence of a sense they did\nnot possess. And if they reflected intelligently on this result,\nthey would perceive also that here was one way in which\npractical value could establish '\ntheoretic '\ntruth.\nWhy then are questions of the sort that Professor Jacks\nsatirizes felt to be absurd ? Their absurdity lies in their\nnaive assumption that they are equally interesting to the\ndenizens of another world, to whom they are supposed to be\naddressed, and are not merely natural questions for us to\nask, but also for them to answer. They presuppose a com-\nmunity of interests between the two worlds, which seems to us\npresumptuous and absurdly unlikely.\nYet there is nothing in itself absurd in presuming a com-\nmunity of interests. Unless we can find or make such a thing,\nwe can hardly hope to establish any effective communication.\nIt is no use trying to ring up any one on the telephone who\n\f204 F. C. S. Schiller, D.Sc. [part\ndoes not want to converse with you, because he knows you will\nbore him with your personal affairs in which he takes no interest.\nThe flaw in these questions lies in the one-sidedness, blind-\nness, and egotism of the st. adpoint from which they are\nasked. If we want to enter into communication with other\nworlds, we must endeavour to ask, not only questions to\nwhich the answers would be of value to us, but also questions\nwhich will seem worth answering to those we address. And\nthis I think we have so far failed to do. Whether we conceive\nthem to have been addressed to angels, devils, spirits of the\ndeparted or '\nelementals,' our questions must have seemed\nintolerably silly, and (as a rule) the answers have paid us\nout in kind. It may well be, therefore, that the value of the\nresponses we have elicited has been so small, because we have\nbeen so stupid ; it would be unscientific to infer from our\nfailures either that no communication is possible or even that\nit has not occasionally in some measure been achieved. But,\nas a rule, the few who have not been too engrossed in mundane\naffairs to interest themselves in such attempts have asked\nfor information either about spiritual spheres, and got de-\nscriptions that were humanly quite unveriiiable, or about\nsuch of their earthly affairs as could hardly be subjects of\ninterest and competence to the denizens of other worlds.\nThey have not contrived questions of interest to both sides,\nwhich would yield evidential answers.\nI do not, however, wish to imply that the fault is wholly\non our side. It may well have been that the only common\ninterest to which we could hitherto appeal was precisely\nthe personal one, viz. the desire to get through a message\nof greeting and consolation to those whom death had left\nbereaved. That certainly, rather than the purely scientific\ndesire to extend our knowledge, has been the driving force\nin such researches as there have been on our side. And why\nnot also on the other ? Such personal messages have not\ninfrequently convinced those for whom they were intended.\nBut, unfortunately, they can rarely be made to appear\nevidential to the world at large, which cannot judge the\nfacts, and naturally suspects the bias of those who can.\nSuccess in Psychical Research, therefore, seems to need\nnot merely systematic and continuous effort on our part,\n\flxix.] Philosophy, Science, and Psychical Research. 205\norganized with much larger resources both in men and money\nthan the world has yet placed at our disposal, but also intelli-\ngent co-operation in what, for purposes of reference alone,\nI ma,y call the '\nspirit '\nworld. And on both sides the efforts\nmade will have to be prompted largely by a scientific desire\nto break down the barriers that evidently exist between the\ndifferent phases of being. These barriers, if a '\nspirit ' world\nexists at all\u2014and I have elsewhere shown that there are no\nreasons, scientific, philosophical or theological, why there\nshould not be one 1\u2014are probably mainly psychological in\ncharacter, and no more substantial than the flimsy fences\nthat restrict the grazing of the Alpine cow.\nIn other words we need a S.P.R. on the other side as well\nas on this. And if we may trust the gradually hardening\nconvictions of those who have most intimately and laboriously\nstudied at first hand the complicated evidence of Cross-Cor-\nrespondences, we seem to be getting something of the sort,\nas more and more of those who were devoted to Psychical\nResearch in a lofty scientific spirit join the majority. But\nI fear that the obstacles in the way of Psychical Research\nmust be even greater on the other side than on this. For a\nvariety of reasons, largely discreditable and therefore unavowed,\nPsychical Research is far from popular on earth. There are\npretty good reasons why it should be even more unpopular\nin the beyond. For the conditions are much less favourable.\nNo one can seriously and honestly contend that it is a good\nthing that we should know nothing about what death means\nto what, again for the purpose of provisional reference, I\nmust call the individual soul, and about what may befall it\nafter that\u2014for I greatly doubt whether the sentiments of those\nwho say that knowledge would destroy the merit of faith\nhave been interpreted aright. But it is easy to conceive\nthat, once the ordeal of death is passed, it may seem in a\nhigh degree repugnant, unnecessary, and degrading to allow\none's thoughts to dwell on the dreadful past and to attempt\nto resume relations with a world like ours. It would at any\nrate demand some leisure and a high degree of unselfishness\nand independence of a social sentiment which would doubtless\n1\nCf. Riddles of the Sphinx, Ch. XI. ; Humanism, Ch.

So it would accord with what we know of human\nnature that, if we survive death, we shall continue to live\nfor the future rather than in the past, and to be sensitive and\nsubmissive to social sentiment.\nWe have come then upon a number of grave intrinsic\nobstacles to Psychical Research : (1) In trying to establish\ncommunications with other worlds we are probably dealing\nwith forces which are not seriously interested in us, or nothing\nlike as much as we are in them ; (2) At present these forces\nare beyond our control.\n(3) We have scarcely any more control over the forces\nat our end of the line, which we could use as instruments\nof exploration. For the\n1\nphysical '\nforces, which we have\nlearnt to some extent to control and use, seem to fail us here.\nThere seems to be very little analogy, and an almost absolute\ndifference of kind, between the '\nphysical '\nand the '\npsychical.'\nAnd though I quite believe that in the end, when we have\nmade as serious and sustained efforts to understand the\npsychical as we have the physical, and considered the whole\nantithesis in a philosophic manner, this difference will turn\nout to be as arbitrary and fictitious in fact as it historically\nwas in origin, it is at present unfortunately true that psycho-\nlogists have not yet succeeded in making the methods which\nare effective in the physical sciences work in the psychical.\nNor have they succeeded as yet to any important extent\nin devising any methods which are distinctively psychical.\nHence psychology at present seems to concern itself chiefly\nwith the multitudinous rivalries of alternative descriptions\nof the psychic processes or data, all of which rest on arbitrary\nabstractions and fictions, and none of which exhibit any\ndecisive superiority by working better than their competitors\nand showing themselves more extensively applicable to the life\nof psychic beings. 1\nIn other words, psychology at present stands\n1\nPerhaps these remarks do not apply quite so definitely to the descriptions\nof '\nfunctional ' psychologies as to '\nstructural,' nor to the hypnotic and\n'\npsycho-analytic '\nmethods of practical psychologists like Morton Prince,\nBoris Sidis and Freud, which have to some extent verified themselves by\nyielding actual cures.\n\flxix.] Philosophy, Science, and Psychical Research. 207\nthe pragmatic test hardly any better than Psychical Research.\nSome day it may supply us with real knowledge about the\n'\nsoul.' which we can apply and act on; but that day is not yet. 1\n(4) This inadequacy of psychology and of its knowledge\nof the '\nsoul '\nbrings me to the last point to which I can draw\nyour attention to-day, viz. the general inadequacy of the\nconceptions with which we have to operate in analysing the\nphenomena that are offered us.\nThat our notions should be inadequate is not of course\nastonishing in itself. For the conceptions in use everywhere\nembody merely the knowledge on record, and nothing more\ncan be extracted from them than was put into them by the\nresearches which consolidated their '\nmeaning.' Consequently\nit is the regular and normal experience of every progressive\nscience to find that its initial conceptions were inadequate\nand have to be extensively modified as its knowledge increases.\nHistory also attests that many centuries of groping often pre-\ncede the discovery of suitable conceptions that will effectively\nanalyse and handle the phenomena a science studies. The\npalmary example occurs in the history of physics. From the\nbeginnings of Greek science the human intelligence strove\nfor over 2000 years to hit upon conceptions that would lead\nto a fruitful treatment of physical phenomena.

Metaphysics,\nideally, should however criticize the limitations of these notions,\nand open our eyes to wider possibilities. But in this case it\nhas not fulfilled its proper function, but merely reduced the\ncommon-sense notions to uselessness and absurdity, while\nso infecting common-sense with its paradoxes that it is hard\nto disentangle its original meaning.\nFrom lack of time I will exemplify these strictures from\ntwo only of the notions we have to use, those of '\nsoul ' and\nof '\nreality.'\n\flxix.] Philosophy, Science, and Psychical Research. 209\n(I.) The conception of 'soul,' as we have lately been re-\nminded by Mr. McDougall's admirable book on Body and\nMind, is one of immemorial antiquity, and enormous elasticity.\nIt embraces and expresses, in varying proportions, the notions\nof a principle to explain life, consciousness, spontaneous\nmobility, breathing, sleeping, dreaming, and possibly others.\nIt is conceived as material or immaterial, as simple, multiple,\nor both at once, as the real man, or as a shadowy reflex,\nas separable from its body and capable of inhabiting others,\nusually as surviving death and often as pre-existing birth.\nNeedless to say, it is a pretty slippery conception to handle,\nand hard to pin down to any definite formula. But on closer\nexamination it will be found that every one of this bewildering\nvariety of functions assigned to the '\nsoul '\nby primitive thought\nis intended to solve a real problem, and that the conception\nof soul is never otiose. Primitive man is not learned enough\nto construct purely verbal problems and to pay himself in\nwords ; common-sense therefore always conceives the '\nsoul\n'\nas a principle of real explanation.\nBut when we turn to metaphysics the situation is greatly\naltered for the worse. The great philosopher of the soul is\nPlato, and in him most of the primitive notions about the soul\njostle each other with little or no attempt to unify them.\nBut, animated by an ascetic dread of the sensible world, Plato\nproceeded to invent also the attribute of immateriality and\nthe notion of pure spirit, which have ever since had a succes\nfou in philosophic circles. He thus paved the way for the\nphilosophic elaboration of the soul into a '\nspiritual substance,'\nabsolutely different in kind from the body, which could be\nproved to be immortal a priori, because it was simple and\ntherefore indissoluble, and could support all its changing\n'\naccidents '\nas an immutable substratum. The intention of\nall this metaphysical defining was of course to demonstrate\nthe soul's immortality without recourse to any laborious\ninterrogation of experience. But the actual effect was not\nonly to fail to do this, but to render the notion of soul\nscientifically useless, and unintelligible, even as metaphysics,\nbecause incapable of performing the function assigned to it\nby definition. As conceived by philosophy, therefore, the soul\nbecame a meaningless principle.\n\f210 F: C. S. Schiller, D.Sc. [part\nTo justify this briefly, I may point out\u2014(1) that the '\nim-\nmateriality '\nascribed to the soul, so far from facilitating a\ngenuinely idealistic interpretation of the world, really con-\ntravened it. A genuine idealism has to try to conceive all\nreality as existing for spirit, and as in some sense ultimately\nspiritual. It must hold, therefore, that the external world\nalso is spiritual in its nature, and cannot admit that there\nis any real incompatibility between apparent materiality\nand real spirituality. This, however, leaves the '\nimmaterial\n'\nfunctionless. Idealism has no need to postulate with Plato\nan immaterial world to be the true home of an immaterial\nsoul which has inexplicably fallen from its high estate and\nis yearning to return to it : nor need it chill the aspirations\nof the natural man with the uncomfortable and unimaginable\ninstitutions of '\nheavens '\ncompounded according to the\nPlatonic recipe. It can argue rather that if it is not incon-\nsistent with the spirituality of reality to reveal itself as a\nsensible and material world now, it need not ever be so, and\ncan infer that the heavenly Jerusalem is a forecast of perfection\nlogically sounder, as well as more agreeable, than the thinly-\nveiled negations of non-sensible being out of space and time.\n(2) However verbally invulnerable a priori proofs of the\nsoul's immortality might be, they could never demonstrate\nthat the metaphysical definitions of the notion were empirically\napplicable to reality, and that '\nsouls ' coming up to their\nspecifications were in fact possessed by anybody. This\nunavoidable defect, which clings to the method of a priori\nreasoning everywhere, renders real proof of matters of fact\nessentially empirical and takes all the effectiveness out of\nthe philosophic arguments about immortality.\n(3) As a matter of fact these verbal '\nproofs '\nof the soul's\nimmortality were far from invulnerable, and Kant had no\ndifficulty in pointing out their obvious gaps and flaws. A\n'\nsimple substance '\ncannot indeed perish by dissolution into\n'\nparts,' which it has not got ; but that need not save it from\nfading out completely. Nor is the soul properly called '\nsimple.'\nRather it is '\none '\nfor some purposes and '\nmany '\nfor others, 1\nand its unity embraces an infinite complexity. A really\n1\nEven the philosophers who most strenuously insist on its '\nunity '\ncannot\nmanage without ascribing to it '\nparts '\nand '\nfaculties.'\n\flxix.] Philosophy, Science, and Psychical Research. 211\nsimple soul-atom would be perfectly useless theoretically,\nand perfectly intolerable practically. It is moreover undis-\ncoverable in psychic life, as Hume proclaimed, and if it could\nbe found, could certainly not be identified with our true self.\n(4) But the most maladroit blunder of all was to conceive\nthe soul as '\na substance,' taken in the sense of an immutable\nsubstratum. For in the first place this notion of substance\nwas inappropriately modelled upon the common-sense notion\nof '\nthings,' which serves us so effectively to group together\nthe changing appearances of the external world. But the\ncourse of inner experience flows very differently. Nothing,\neven remotely, thing-like appears in it, nothing requiring to\nbe hung upon the peg of '\nsubstance.' A '\nsoul ' is composed\nof '\nprocesses,' not of '\nthings,' and even its '\npermanence '\nis\nthat of a stream and not that of the rock it carves into. It\nis in unceasing change, and neither immutable, nor required\nto be so. For an immutable soul would be incapable of learn-\ning by experience, and no one wishes to have such a stupidly\nineducable soul. 1\nWhat we want is to change and yet to be\n'\nthe same,' to preserve our '\nidentity '\nin changes (preferably\nfor the better), and the only spot in the universe where the\npossibility of this feat seems to be revealed to us is in our\npersonal experience. And even if we overlooked these differ-\nences, the notion of substance does not explain even the nature\nof '\nthings.' No one has ever been able to conceive how a\n'\nsubstance '\nfunctioned, how its '\nattributes ' '\ninhered '\nin it,\nor how an immutable substratum could guarantee to '\nthings\n'\ntheir identity and permanence. For the changes which\npass over the '\nthing '\ndo not touch its '\nsubstance,' nor can\nthe '\nsubstance '\nexercise any influence on the course of the\nchanges. There is not even an imaginable connexion between\nthe '\nsubstance '\nand its '\naccidents '\n; and there are no means\nof knowing what is happening to the former, because ex hypothesi\nall we ever know is the behaviour of the latter. The truth\nis that this notion of '\nsubstance '\nis not functional at all,\nand explains nothing either about '\nthings '\nor about '\nsouls.'\nIt is no wonder therefore that modern psychology has no use\nfor a metaphysical soul of this sort.\n1\nExcept, apparently, some philosophers (as Schopenhauer), for whom\ntime is '\nunreal,' and therefore learning illusory.\n\f212 F. C. S. Schiller, D.Sc. [part\nIt should be clear by now that we must get a better notion\nof substance, before we can get a helpful notion of soul, that\nwill enable us to attack the complexities of our psychic nature\nas they are beginning to reveal themselves in the phenomena\nof multiple personality, trance, automatism, and what we have\nventured to label '\ntelepathy.' Unfortunately I have no time\non this occasion to suggest the positive developments of the\nnotion of soul that might advantageously be tried. 1\n(II.) The defects and ambiguities of the term '\nreality ' are\nstill more mischievous. For they enter into and vitiate all\ninquiries into the reality of anything ; so that, even if we had\nsucceeded in meaning something definite by '\nsoul,' we could\nhardly discuss whether '\nsouls '\nwere '\nreal ' until we had settled\nwhat we meant by '\nreality.'\nThe particular point however I want to make to-day is\nthat in Psychical Research we are specially concerned with\nthe ambiguities of '\nreality.' We are continually endeavour-\ning to test '\nfacts '\nof sorts, which lay claim to '\nreality '\nin\nsome sense, and to assign their proper sense to each, and in\nthis process we may often have to revise or modify the classi-\nfications of realities which are good enough for the purposes\nof ordinary life and even of the sciences, and in the end may\neven have to declare thoroughly shallow and inadequate\nbeliefs which are almost universally accepted. For example,\nif there is anything about which ordinary persons, philo-\nsophers and scientists may be said to agree it is that the simple\nand proper answer to the question '\nHow many real worlds\nare there ?\n'\nis '\nOne !\n'\n; and yet it is impossible to concern\noneself at all seriously with psychical phenomena without\nfeeling that this answer is, so far, quite an unwarranted piece\nof simplification.\nThe first sense of '\nreality '\nis the merely formal sense to\nwhich formal logic restricts itself. It constitutes anything\nan object of discourse, and must be possessed by anything\ntalked about, however nonsensical and absurd it may be.\nBut as this sort of reality is presupposed in every real inquiry,\nit may perhaps be dismissed as unimportant.\nWe next find that the other senses of '\nreality '\nare derivative\n1\nSome hints, however, together with a reconstruction of the conception\nof substance, will be found in Humanism, Ch. XII.\n\flxix.] Philosophy, Science, and Psychical Research. 213\nfrom two main sources. To the first, which we may call\nthe psychological, anything is '\nreal '\nthat is experienced,\nand moreover as it is experienced, and nothing is unreal that\nany one can be got to experience. It follows that errors,\nillusions, hallucinations, dreams, etc., are all possessed of\nthis sort of reality. The '\nimaginary '\npains of hysterical\npatients also are real in this sense.\nThe second main sense we may call the pragmatic and\nexplain by saying that for it the '\nreal '\nis the important. Its\nclassical description by James declares that \" whatever\nthings have intimate and continuous connexion with my life\nare things of whose reality I cannot doubt.\" 1\nIn this sense\n'\nreality '\nis clearly a value, and admits of gradations, and is\nessentially relative to purposes and their order of importance.\nIt is this sense which dominates our sciences and our ordinary\nlife. The common-sense beliefs of ordinary life have an\nindefeasible reality, because they are undeniably important.\nSo are the realities of ethics and politics, and the other opinions\nwhich have social currency.\nThe realities of the sciences are less universally impressive :\nfor though the objects of every science are of course real for\nit, however fictitious and abstract they may seem to common\nsense, like e.g. the realities of mathematics, and however\nlittle interest we may take in them, many of us manage to\navoid any very intimate contact with the realities of many\nsciences. Yet even in such cases we have to concede that,\nin so far as the sciences are important for life, the reality of\nthe '\nrealities '\nthey posit must be admitted.\nIt is however to be noted (1) that all the realities mentioned\nare (or are supposed to be) common, i.e. to be shared by many,\nand not to be in their nature objects only for a single per-\ncipient. The one exception to this which common-sense\nallows is the reality of pleasures and pains. We are willing\nto admit that our fellow creatures have feelings, although we\ncan never apparently feel them. But the pragmatic reasons\nwhich compel us to make this exception are so obvious that it\nonly confirms our contention that the '\nreal ' is the important.\n(2) All these positive values which we call realities are\nhaunted by negative counterparts, variously named '\nerrors,'\n1\nPrinciples of Psychology, Vol. II., p. 298.\n\f214 F. G. S. Schiller, D.Sc. [part\n'\nfailures,' '\nunrealities,' etc. Neither our science nor our\npublic opinion is actually infallible, though it is often con-\ntended that ideally they should be. We try to put the blame\nfor such failures on the fallibility of individuals, and label\nthem '\nsubjective,' although most errors are collective and\npopular, and every truth starts its mundane career as the\ndiscovery of some unhappy wight who is sure to be persecuted\nby all the authorities for making it.\nNevertheless, we cannot, by attaching a stigma to these\n'\nunrealities,' deprive them of psychological reality (in the first\nsense) ; we only lump them together with such '\nsubjective\n?\nrealities as '\ndreams '\nand '\nhallucinations.' By coalescing\nwith these they form a formidable host, capable of very\nseriously upsetting the conventional beliefs both of ordinary\nlife and of the sciences. Ordinarily, however, little attention\nis paid them ;\nthey are flung out on the rubbish heaps, and\nofficially their existence is denied.\nNow this is where ive come in, and come across them. Both\nfor the reason that they are '\nsubjective '\nand because they are\nsuspected of error and illusion, they concern us nearly. For\nall the subjects we investigate seem to have a reality which\nis largely of the sort called '\nsubjective '\n; indeed there is\nusually a question whether they have any other. They are\nalso peculiarly subject to error and illusion. We are bound,\ntherefore, to become expert in dealing with perplexing material\nof this sort, and to fit ourselves to work over the rubbish heaps\nof all the sciences for residual products of value.\nNow when we do this we cannot but note two facts. (1)\nThough in a general way the sort of reality which the various\nobjects of our interest have has become pretty plain, yet\nthere is always a fringe of disputed cases. No sphere of interest\nis sharply defined, and each gets shadowy at the edges. E.g.\nwe feel quite confident that in general the science of astronomy\ndoes not deal in illusions, and yet at the present moment\nwe must say that the '\ncanals '\nof Mars may be only '\noptical\n'\nphenomena. Again, while the N-rays have been relegated\nto the realm of illusion, the synthesis of elements is either\na great physical discovery or an error of experimentation.\nThe subjects whose scientific place in reality is thus ambiguous\nvary of course from time to time, but there always are such\n\flxix.] Philosophy, Science, and Psychical Research. 215\npuzzles, and in any decision of them psychology must always\nhave a large part ; the case therefore runs closely parallel to\nour own problem in dealing with the supernormal : in both\ncases the alternative explanation is illusion, and psychology\nis relevant, if it is understood as the psychology of actual\nminds, and not as a mere juggle with abstractions.\n(2) We note that though our ordinary classification of\nrealities usually stands, yet realities which do not normally\nrank high in the scale do become valuable upon occasion,\nand force us to take them seriously by the importance they\nacquire. This is particularly true of such things as dreams,\ntrances and visions, which have not infrequently turned the\ncourse of history. The visions of Jeanne d'Arc, for example,\ndecisively checked the English conquest of France, and force\nus to choose between a recognition of their supernormality\nand the alternative that '\ndelusions '\nmay be the really\nimportant and dynamic forces in human life\u2014a view ill\ncalculated to enhance the rationality of human history.\nBut does not this occurrence of valuable realities in unlikely\nquarters cast an extensive doubt on the correctness of the\nclassifications which common-sense accepts as final because\nthey usually suffice ? When we combine these anomalies\nwith the general presumption of the fallibility of all our know-\nledge, are we not driven to inquire whether the distinction\nbetween the '\nreal '\nand the '\nunreal ' is as rigid and absolute\nas we commonly assume ? As a matter of fact the real and\nthe unreal seem to interpenetrate in the subtlest fashion, and\nto be separable only in the roughest way for the most coarsely\npractical purposes. So may there not lurk in '\ndreams '\nand\ntheir kin far more valuable revelations than we have yet ex-\ntracted from them, while on the other hand the multitudinous\nabstractions, theories and fictions, of which the sciences\nproclaim the '\nreality '\nso loudly, and even those common-\nsense realities which so irresistibly obtrude themselves in\npractice, may in very sooth turn out to be but fashionable\nmodes of '\ndreaming '\n?\nThese suggestions seem to me worth dwelling on, both\ndirectly and for their own sakes, as opening out what may\nprove profitable lines of investigation, and indirectly, as\nabating our excessive trust in the reigning '\ntruths,' and\n\f216 F. G. 8. Schiller, D.Sc. [part\ncompelling both the man of science and the man in the street\nto face the fact that the foundations of their ordinary inter-\npretation of experience are by no means as assured and stable\nas they find it convenient to believe. Let us marshal, there-\nfore, in a progressive series the doubts that should save us\nfrom premature dogmatizing about the '\nreal '\nand the\n'\nunreal.'\n( 1 ) So long as we restrict our regards to the ordinary routine\nof everyday life, the realities we encounter seem solid and\nassured enough. On the level of common-sense, on which\nwe spend our days (if not our nights), we live as animate\nbodies amid other bodies which we distinguish as animate and\ninanimate, feeling, moving, changing, acting upon them, and\ninteracting with them, finding them hard, rough, cold, noisy,\nmalodorous, unpalatable, or their opposites, in various ways\nand degrees. This common-sense view of reality imposes\nitself upon all in their actions, whatever the over-beliefs they\nmay privately add to it in their philosophic or religious cogita-\ntions.\n(2) But even the ordinary man does not live wholly by\nroutine, and most men are extraordinary when you can really\nprobe into their souls. So the '\nrealities '\nof common-sense\ndo not satisfy them. Indeed they are not entirely satisfactory\nobjectively, as men discover after a time. In order really\nto understand this world of sense and common-sense we have\nto devise a multitude of sciences, which enormously enhance\nour power over the real. But in so doing they abrogate the\nrealities of common-sense and substitute constructions of\ntheir own which are very different. For none of the sciences\nis the sensible world really '\nreal,' and more than a starting-\npoint for conceptual experiments. It is as vain to appeal\nto physics as to geometry to substantiate the visible, audible,\ntangible '\nthing '\nour matter-of-factness loves to embrace as a\nsolid fact. Geometry deals only in immutable, immaterial\nshapes in an ideal space in which no thing could possibly\nmove or live. Physics deals only in creatures like '\nmolecules,'\n'\natoms '\nand '\nelectrons '\nthat possess neither temperature,\ncolour, nor solidity, but move with incredible velocities in\na space and a time that are wholly relative through a mysterious\n'\nether '\nwhich has been expressly invented as a vehicle for the\n\flxix.] Philosophy, Science, and Psychical Research. 217\nparadoxical qualities which the science of the time finds it\nconvenient to attribute to the physically '\nreal.'\n(3) Not only do our sciences thus disavow our senses, but\nthey are mostly not on speaking terms with each other. In\nthe name of scientific specialization they claim the right to\nmake incompatible assumptions, which, when they meet\n(as officially they never need do), simply cut each other. But\nwhat is a concrete human being to think when e.g. he learns,\nin physics, that a colour is a definite rate of vibration in the\nether, and, in psychology, that it is a '\nsimple sensation '\n?\nMust he not infer from the difficulty of finding anything to\nmediate the transition from the one to the other of these\nmodes of regarding his '\nsensible quality '\nthat both are prag-\nmatic conveniences for scientific purposes, and that in the end\nit is his experience and his needs that both are catering for ?\n(4) The '\nrealities '\nthe various sciences assume do not\nmerely conflict with each other : they also administer a severe\nshock to what might otherwise be dangerously plausible\npretenders to reality. I mean the accounts of ultimate reality\ngiven by the various philosophies and religions. For, in the\nname of scientific method, they insist that these accounts\nshall be susceptible of verification, and to this pragmatic test\nneither the metaphysics nor the theologies seem willing to\nsubmit. Hence the modern mind seems to be inclining more\nand more to the conclusion that the philosophies express\nlittle beyond the idiosyncrasies of their authors, while the\nreligions all suffer not only from the badness of the historical\nevidence to which they appeal, but also from incapacity to\nsee that historical evidence never suffices to establish scientific\ntruth. 1\nWhen in addition the irreconcilable varieties and\nincompatibilities of these masses of speculation are noted,\nit is no wonder that they are growing more and more '\nunreal\n'\nand tending to be classed with '\ndreams.'\n(5) Variability, however, is no reproach to address to the\nresults of uncritical speculation alone. It occurs also in the\n1\n1 do myself not hold that this condemnation is altogether just in either\ncase. But I cannot help noting the trend of thought, and the responsibility\nfor it of the expounders both of the religions and of the philosophies.

It\nshould be noted, however, that there is no necessary correlation\nbetween the improvement in scientific value which a new theory\neffects and the change in our beliefs about '\nreality ' which\nit demands. Quite a slight improvement in the interpretation\nof scientific facts may entail a complete revolution in our\nconception of reality, as was exemplified by the substitution\nof the Copernican for the Ptolemaic explanation of the suc-\ncession of day and night.\n(6) Similarly what are theoretically quite easy emendations\nmay enormously alter the bearing of scientific truths upon\nour life.

The individual\nsoul, which science seemed to abstract from and philosophy\ndespised, is after all the principle of unity and order, because\nit is the only available agency of selection. It stands at the\ncore and centre of the cosmos and occupies the sole point at\nwhich aU the various sorts of reality intersect, the sole position\nfrom which they can be controlled and unified. How that\nmay be it is still premature to guess ; but the indications do\nnot at present favour any more '\nobjective ' unification of\nall that claims '\nreality.'

Gerald W. Balfour.\nThe evidence I propose to lay before you in this paper in\nfavour of personal survival, and in support of the belief that\ncommunications may and do reach us from those who have\npassed out of the body, is based upon four passages from\nScripts of different dates produced by the automatist who is\nknown to members of the Society under the pseudonym of\nMrs. Willett.\nIn the Proceedings, Vol. XXV., pp. 113-217, will be found\na careful and exhaustive discussion by Sir Oliver Lodge and\nMrs. Verrall of certain scripts written in February, 1910, by\nMrs. Willett, and purporting to convey the answer of Myers\nto the question :\n\" What does the word Lethe suggest to\nyou ?\n\" These scripts, now generally referred to as \" the\nLethe scripts,\" were of a very remarkable character.\nThe writers of the papers in the Proceedings contended :\n(1) That there were interconnexions between the Willett\nscripts and the scripts of other automatic writers (with some\nof which, at least, Mrs. Willett was wholly unacquainted),\nthat clearly indicated a supernormal origin ;\n(2) That the classical and literary knowledge exhibited in\nthe scripts was beyond what Mrs. Willett normally possessed,\nand again pointed to a supernormal origin ;\n(3) That the simplest and most probable hypothesis to\naccount for all the facts of the case was that the Lethe scripts\nhad really been inspired by the surviving personality of the\nscholar and man of letters from whom the scripts showing\n1\nThis paper was read to a meeting of the Society on March 27. 1914.\n\f222 Bight Hon.

Probably its weakest point lay in\nthe difficulty of proving that the classical and literary allusions\nwere beyond the normally-acquired knowledge of the auto-\nmatist.\nThe case I am about to lay before you differs in some respects\nfrom the Lethe case. On the one hand it involves no cross-\ncorrespondences or interconnexions with the scripts of other\nautomatic writers, but is self-contained. No doubt this will\ncome as a relief to many members of the Society for whom\ncross-correspondences have grown to be somewhat of a weari-\nness of the flesh. On the other hand the subject-matter in the\npresent case seems to me to be more clearly outside the range\nof the automatist's normal knowledge than in the Lethe\nscripts, and, in this respect, to be more evidentially com-\npelling.\nTo facilitate the task of exposition, I will first quote from\nthe four scripts by Mrs. Willett such extracts as are relevant\nto the case. The scripts cannot be given in their entirety for\nreasons of a private nature. But the relevant passages are\nin every case easily detachable from the remainder of the\nscript ; and I am able to assure you that neither their inter-\npretation nor their evidential value is in any way affected\nby separation from their contexts.

What this passage was long remained\na mystery to the little group of researchers who were studying\nthe Willett scripts. It had indeed from the first been supposed\nto be connected in some way with the late Dr. Verrall. The\nscript of July 6, 1912, contains two lines from a poem by\nChristina Rossetti called \" Uphill,\" the subject of which is\nDeath. Now Dr. Verrall had died only a few weeks before\n(on June 18, 1912). Though Mrs. Willett knew him but\nslightly, she was a friend of Mrs. Verrall ; and this being\n\fLXIX.] Evidence of Personal Survival. 225\nthe first script she had written since Dr. Verrall's death, it\nwas natural to expect that reference to him would be made\nin it. Moreover, a phrase in this same script \" does she re-\nmember \" was reminiscent of similar phrases in which \" she\n\"\nclearly alluded to Mrs. Verrall. To this extent, then, we\nhad correctly interpreted the script of July 6, 1912, as the\nlater scripts have conclusively proved. But the \" passage\n\"\nto which allusion was made in it completely baffled us. None\nof us, Mrs. Verrall herself as little as the rest, could remember\nanything in literature, whether ancient or modern, which\nsatisfactorily corresponded to the description of the Timid\nTraveller.\nIt may be convenient to state at this point that throughout\nthe period covered by the printed extracts we were careful\nto keep all our conjectures and conclusions to ourselves. For\ninstance, Mrs. Willett was never told that we believed her\nscript of July 6, 1912, to contain allusions to Dr. Verrall ;\nand to this day (March 27, 1914) she has no idea of the inter-\npretations to which we have ultimately been led and which\nI shall presently have to submit for your consideration.\nThe subject had been almost forgotten, when, as we have\nseen, it was unexpectedly revived in three successive scripts\nof August and September, 1913. Of these three scripts the\ntwo first confirmed our impression that the mysterious passage\nwas in some way connected with Dr. Verrall, but did not\notherwise seem to advance the solution of the problem. The\nSeptember script, on the other hand\u2014the only one written\nwith Mrs. Verrall present\u2014contained the important state-\nment that \" Dante makes it clear.\" 1\nThis was evidently a clue worth following up, and it soon\nled to fruitful results. What is the link between Dr. Verrall\nand Dante ?\nIn the spring of 1913 was published a collection of Literary\nEssays, Classical and Modern, contributed by Dr. Verrall at\nvarious dates to various magazines and periodicals. Among\nthe Essays are three Papers dealing with the interpretation\n1 The sentence \" What moves the stars and all the heavenly bodies ?\n\"\nwhich precedes the words \" Dante makes it clear,\" is an allusion to the last\nline of the Divina Commedia :\n\" L'Amor che muove il Sole e 1'altre stelle.\"\n\f226 Right Hon. Gerald W. Balfour. [part\nof passages in the Divina Commedia . One of these, on \" The\nBirth of Virgil,\" does not concern us here. The other two\nare occupied with a historical problem concerning the Latin\npoet Statius, an imitator of Virgil, who lived and wrote in\nthe second half of the first century a.d., and whose reputation\nstood a good deal higher in Dante's time than it does to-day.\nHis principal work was the Thebaid, which described the\nlegendary War of the Seven against Thebes. Readers of\nDante will remember that he and Virgil on their pilgrimage\nthrough Purgatory meet the soul of Statius, which happens\nat that very moment to have completed the Purgatorial\nexpiation assigned to it, and is therefore free to accompany\nthe two other poets on the remainder of their journey up\nthe Mount.\nNow to place Statius in Purgatory was to make him out\nto be a Christian, which there is no ground in any record or\ntradition to believe that he was. Dante, however, goes yet\nfurther. Not only does he make the bold historical assump-\ntion that at some time or other in his life Statius became a\nconvert to Christianity : he has \" the audacity \"\u2014to quote\nDr. Verrall's words\u2014\" to date the event, the baptism, by a\nparticular passage, a definite point in the Thebaid, which no\none familiar Avith the poem could fail to recognize. '\nI had\nreceived baptism,' so he makes Statius say, '\nbefore, as a\npoet. I had brought the Greeks to the rivers of Thebes.'\n\"\nWhat justification could Dante have had for taking this\nstrange liberty with accepted history ?\nThis is the question which Dr. Verrall sets himself to answer\nin the two essays to which I have referred, and which have\nfor their respective titles \" To follow the Fisherman \" and\n\"Dante on the Baptism of Statius.\"\nYou will perhaps think I am wandering from the subject\nof my Paper, and wonder where I am coming to. But wait\na bit and see. I shall be very much disappointed if before\nI have finished I have not succeeded in convincing you that\nin \" Dante on the Baptism of Statius \" is to be found the\nelusive passage of which we are in search.\nIn order to make this fully intelligible I shall have to follow\nrather closely part of the argument of this Essay, and even\nto quote from it at some length. Indeed I would strongly\n\fLXIX.] Evidence of Personal Survival. 227\nadvise those of you who may be interested in the subject\nof my Paper to read for yourselves both the Essays. Taken\ntogether they form one of the most brilliant and ingenious\npieces of literary criticism that I can call to mind ; and the\nEssay on the Baptism of Statius in particular is so charac-\nteristic of its author, that if his individuality still persists,\nand, being wishful to communicate with those yet in the\nbody, he had elected to refer to this essay in proof of his\npersonal survival, I doubt whether a more appropriate choice\ncould have been made.\nFirst let me quote the passage from the Ptirgatorio round\nwhich the whole discussion turns. Statius is giving an account\nof his conversion to his two fellow-poets. His first impulse\ntowards Christianity arose, he explains, from his study of\nthe famous Messianic Eclogue of Virgil.\nThrough thee (he says, addressing the latter) I was a poet,\nthrough thee a Christian, but that thou mayest see better what\nI outline, I will put forth my hand to fill in colour. Already the\nwhole world was big with the true belief, sown by the apostles\nof the everlasting kingdom ; and thy words, touched on above,\nharmonised so with the new preachers, that the habit took me\nof visiting them. They then became so holy in my sight, that\nwhen Domitian persecuted them, their wailings were not without\ntears of mine. And while by me yon world was trod, I succoured\nthem, and their righteous lives made me despise all other sects ;\nand ere in my poem I had brought the Greeks to Thebes' rivers,\nI received baptism, but through fear I was a secret Christian,\nlong time pretending paganism.1\nThe translation I have given you is taken from what Dr.\nVerrall calls \" the faithful prose of the Temple Classics,\" and\nmay be accepted as a correct version of the passage as gener-\nally understood. But Dr. Verrall, seizing upon two linguistic\nrefinements, has managed to invest Dante's lines with a com-\npletely new significance.\nIn the first place he contends that the words mentre che\ndi la per me si stette, translated in the version I have just read\nto you \" while by me yon world was trod,\" cannot properly\nbear this meaning. A literal rendering of the words would\n1\nPurgatorio, XXII., 73-91.\n\f228 Right Hon. Gerald W. Balfour. [part\nbe \" while I stayed on the other side \" ; but the peculiar\nlinguistic form used implies that the staying was in some\nsense the voluntary act of the stayer ; so that we should\nbe nearer the true meaning in translating them \" while I\nlingered on the other side.\" Moreover, if the phrase means\nnothing more than \" while I lived \" or \" before I died,\" the\neffect is to put into Statius' mouth the strange statement\nthat he had become favourably disposed towards Christianity\nbefore he died, and actually a Christian before he wrote a\ncertain line in the Thebaid, i.e. six years or more prior to his\ndeath. The greater includes the less ; and if Statius became\na Christian six years prior to his death, it is, to say the least\nof it, unnecessary to tell us that before he died he had become\nfavourably disposed to Christianity. Mentre che di Id per me\nsi stette, according to Dr. Verrall, can have, in the context\nin which it occurs, one meaning and one meaning only. It\nmust signify \" while I abstained from joining the Church.\"\nIn the second place Dr. Verrall points out that the render-\ning \" ere in my poem I had brought the Greeks to Thebes'\nrivers, I received baptism,\" ignores the emphasis which the\norder of the Italian words lays on the pronoun \"I.\" \" Ebb'\nio battesmo \" is what Dante writes ; and the more correct\ntranslation would be \" Ere in my poem I had brought the\nGreeks to Thebes' rivers, I myself received baptism.\"\nStarting from these premises, Dr. Verrall arrives at an\ninterpretation of the passage as a whole which I must give\nin his own words :\nThe question arises, by what thought or metaphor Dante is\nled to describe the delay or hesitation of the convert, his abstention\nfrom the decisive step of receiving initiation, as a staying \" on\nthe other side.\" On the other side of what ? The context again\nfurnishes the answer, about which indeed we could hardly doubt,\neven if we were left to conjecture. The comparison of baptism\nto a river is, for obvious reasons, so well established and familiar,\nthat, in this connexion, it would be almost sufficiently signified\nby \"on the other side \" itself. But Dante explicitly gives us\nthe \" river \"\n\u2014\n\" e pria ch' io conducessi i Greci ai fiumi\ndi Tebe, poetando, ebb' io battesmo :\n\"\n\fLXIX.] Evidence of Personal Survival. 229\n\" And before, as a poet, I brought the Greeks to the rivers of Thebes,\nI had myself received baptism.\" The emphasis on of Thebes,\ngiven by the position of the words in the verse, and on myself,\ngiven by the inversion \" ebb' io,\"' imply an antithesis or com-\nparison between Statius and the Greeks of the poem, between\nthe \" rivers \" to which they came and that to which he came,\nthe river, according to the familiar figure, of baptism. This river\nhe long hesitated to pass ; he \" halted on the other side,\" as a man,\nwho was no hero, might, when to be baptised was to be in danger of\ndeath,\u2014though, as he tells us, the delay cost him centuries of expiation\nupon the purgatorial mountain. But before he brought his Argives\nto the Asopus, he himself had made his passage.1\nI do not think we need go further afield in quest of our\nTimid Traveller, and of the river which he is afraid to cross.\nThe timid traveller is Statius himself, and the river is the\nmetaphorical river of baptism into the Christian faith. Indeed\nDr. Verrall goes so far as to maintain that Dante plays upon\nthe name of Statius, interpreting it to mean \" the stationary\none,*' the \" Stayer \"'\nor \" Hesitater.\" xAlready in his own day\nStatius appears to have incurred the censure of the critics\nfor his excessive dilatoriness in getting to the avowed subject\nof his poem. The Thebaid, I may remind you again, is an\nepic poem describing the expedition against Thebes by the\nfamous Seven Chieftains. It consists of twelve books, and\nat the end of the sixth book the Argive host has not yet entered\nthe enemy's country. It is not until the seventh book that\nStatius brings the invaders to the bank of the Theban river,\nin the line which Dante quotes as marking the period of his\nconversion to Christianity. The poet's full name was Publius\nPapinius Statius, and Dr. Verrall suggests that Dante took\n\" Statius \" to be no part of his original name, but a literary\nnickname applied to denote this characteristic of dilatoriness\nin his poetic compositions, and no less applicable to his delay\nin entering the Christian Church.\nDr. Verrall may be right or he may be wrong in this as in\nhis other conclusions. That really does not concern us ; nor\ndo I pretend to have done justice to the whole argument of\nthe Essay. The point for us is that the passage we have\n1\nThe italics in the last two sentences are my own.\n\f230 Bight Hon. Gerald W. Balfour. [part\nbeen looking for is to be found in an essay written by Dr.\nVerrall himself ;\nthough, as we shall see, not one readily\naccessible to the general public till nine or ten months after\nthe first script that refers to it was produced.\nI am afraid you may think I have been almost as long,\nin proportion, in bringing you up to the brink of my river\nas the poet was in bringing his Greeks to the banks of the\nAsopus. Perhaps I have justly laid myself open to this\nreproach. But as the whole superstructure of the subsequent\nargument rests on the identification of the \" passage \" which\nthe script bids us search for with that which I have just read\nfrom Dr. Verralks essay, it was necessary for my purpose to\nestablish the foundation as firmly as possible.\nThe fact that this essay brings into conjunction Dr. Verrall\nhimself, Dante and a traveller or pilgrim who hesitates to\ncross a river, is to my mind almost convincing proof that\nit contains the passage we are looking for. But any doubt\nthat may still remain will vanish, I think, before one decisive\nconsideration.\nWhen Statius, in the lines of which I have already read a\ntranslation, says to Virgil \" Through thee I was a poet, through\nthee a Christian,\" he adds \" but that thou mayest the better\nsee what I outline I will put forth my hand to fill in colour.'\"\nDr Verrall quotes these lines, and explains them to mean\nthat Dante himself felt that his account of the manner and\ndate of Statius' conversion rested on an imaginative inter-\npretation of the passage in the Thebaid on which he was relying,\nand went considerably beyond its literal meaning. Now turn\nto the printed extract from the Willett script of July 6, 1912 :\n\" What the passage does not say I draw from my own mind\nto make the connection clear\nT\nWe have here an unmistakable paraphrase of the very\nwords that Dante puts into the mouth of Statius ! And\nwhat I will again ask you specially to note is that this crown-\ning proof that the passage has been correctly identified occurs\nin the earliest of the four scripts that refer to the subject.\nThe importance of this will become clearer in the sequel.\nHaving successfully traced our mysterious passage to its\nsource, our next task must be to enquire what evidential\n\fLXIX.] Evidence of Personal Survival. 231\nvalue the references to it in Willett Script possess. Are we\nentitled to conclude from them to the continuous existence\nof a personality that has survived the grave ?\nOn this question I cannot expect unanimity ; but I will\nendeavour to state my own view.\nLet me point out to begin with, that whatever intelligence\nmay be responsible for the scripts, it can hardly be doubted\nthat we have in them a deliberate attempt to produce at least\nthe semblance of evidence of survival. And it is a remark-\nably clever attempt too. The intelligence must certainly have\npossessed something more than a mere superficial acquaint-\nance with Dr. Verrall's essay. The boiling down of the whole\ncomplicated case into the description of a traveller or pilgrim\nwho would fain cross a certain river, but hesitates through\nfear to make the plunge, and still more perhaps the direct\nparaphrase of the two relevant lines from the Purgatorio, prove\nthis incontestable. Could the intelligence have been that of\nthe automatist, and could she have acquired the requisite\nknowledge normally and consciously ? If so, she must have\nread the essay, and read it with care and attention. Towards\nthe end of October, 1913, I sent to Mrs. Willett herself the\nfollowing questions, without however telling her my reason\nfor putting them :\n(1) Have you read an essay by Dr. Verrall contained in\nhis Literary Essays, Classical and Modern, and entitled \" Dante\non the Baptism of Statius \" ? If so, when did you read\nit ?\n(2) Did you ever hear of this essay before the lately pub-\nlished volume came out ?\n(3) The essay originally appeared in the Albany Revieio\nin 1908. Have you ever seen or heard of the Albany Review ?\nTo these questions I have received answers in writing\u2014\n-\nthe answers being in every case in the negative. The volume\nwas sent to Mrs. Willett as a present from Mrs. Verrall in\nMay, 1913. She had glanced through the Memoir at the\nbeginning of the book ; but was positive that neither then\nnor since had she read any of the essays contained in it. Of\nthis particular essay Mrs. Willett was certain she had never\neven heard until she received my set of questions. Nor had\nshe ever either seen or heard of the Albany Review.\n\f232 Eight Hon. Gerald W. Balfour. [part\nIf we accept Mrs. Willett's evidence as valid, these state-\nments are conclusive on the points with which they deal.\nIf we decline to accept it as valid, and still suppose that the\nknowledge shown in her scripts was acquired normally and\nconsciously, then she must either have forgotten the fact\nor be fraudulently concealing it.\nNo one who knows Mrs. Willett will believe her to be cap-\nable of deliberate deception. The matter is not one to argue\nabout with those who do not know her. I can only say that\nthis alternative possibility does not trouble me personally.\nI simply reject it, and with absolute conviction.\nThere remains the possibility of forgetfulness. Mrs. Willett\nmay have read the essay and afterwards lost all recollection\nof it so far as her ordinary consciousness was concerned. I\nam not prepared to deny that this is possible. Hidden\nmemories undoubtedly do sometimes re-appear in scripts\nwithout being recognized as memories by the writers. In\nsuch cases we must suppose that they still lie preserved in\nwhat is commonly called the subliminal self, or at least are\nrecoverable by it ; and we may, if we like, suppose that the\nsubliminal can use them on its own account, and for its own\npurposes, if it has any, just as if it were an individual con-\nsciousness distinct from the supraliminal.\nBut consider what the hypothesis implies in the present\ninstance. It requires us to assume, first, that at some time\nMrs. Willett must have read this essay of Dr. Verrall's and\nread it with care and understanding ;\nsecondly, that, having\ndone so, she forgot all about it ;\nthirdly, that her subliminal\nself waited its opportunity and in due course, a few weeks\nafter Dr. Verrall's death, proceeded to manufacture out of\nthe knowledge so acquired an elaborately evidential case of\na fraudulent character in favour of survival. If we are willing\nto go as far as this, we shall no doubt be inclined to go further,\nand suggest that it was the subliminal self that prompted\nMrs. Willett to read the essay, and afterwards inhibited her\nfrom remembering that she had done so.\nI repeat . such a hypothesis is possible. It is one of the\nalternative explanations we have to bear in mind. I do not\nmyself think it probable ; and the improbability in this case\nis greatly added to, and the evidential value of the case itself\n\fLXIX.] Evidence of Personal Survival. 233\nincreased, by a consideration of dates. As regards the three\nlatest scripts we have to recognize that Mrs. Willett had an\nopportunity of reading the essay before they were written, be-\ncause the volume containing it was in her hands in May, 1913,\nand these scripts were written in the following August and Sep-\ntember. The first script, on the other hand\u2014that of July 6,\n1912\u2014was not only produced many months before she re-\nceived the volume, but many months before it was published.\nIf, therefore, she had read the essay before this script was\nproduced, she must have read it in the Albany Review, in\nwhich it originally appeared. That takes us back to August,\n1908, before Mrs. Verrall and Mrs. Willett became known to\neach other. I do not know if many persons among my readers\nare acquainted even with the name of the Albany Review.\nIt was quite new to me until I began to study this case last\nautumn ; but I understand it was a magazine conducted\nlargely by a few Cambridge men, which had an ephemeral\nexistence, and came to an end two or three years ago. I\nthink it extremely unlikely that Mrs. Willett should ever\nhave seen it, and equally unlikely that she should have got\nto know about the essay from any other source. Such purely\nliterary questions have no sort of interest for her. Both\nMrs. Verrall and Miss Verrall are confident that they never\nspoke to her on the subject.\nLooking, then, to this first and most important of the four\nscripts\u2014important by reason of its date, and also by reason\nof its containing that clinching paraphrase of the two lines\nfrom Dante already referred to\u2014I claim that our verdict\non any explanation which requires us to assume that at some\ntime prior to July 6, 1912, the essay was read by Mrs. Willett,\nmust be \" Not wholly impossible, but in a very high degree\nimprobable.\"\nWhat then ? If the knowledge shown by the scripts was\nnot normally obtained, it must have been obtained super-\nnormally\u2014that is, it must have been telepathically derived\nfrom some consciousness distinct from that of the automatist.\nWhat kind of consciousness ? Incarnate or discarnate ?\nAgain, design is manifest in the scripts, inasmuch as they\nuse their material, whencesoever derived, to serve a definite\npurpose. Who was responsible for the design ? Was it the\n\f234 Right Hon. Gerald W. Balfour. [part\nsubconscious self of the automatist, or was the automatist\nlittle more than an instrument played upon by the same\nindependent consciousness which supplied the material of the\nscripts ?\nHere are tAvo pairs of alternatives. Taken together they\ngive four possible combinations, any one of which might be\nput forward as the true account of what actually occurred.\nThus the really active and planning intelligence may have\nbeen :\n(1) Mrs. Willett's subconscious self, drawing its material\nfrom some other embodied consciousness ;\n(2) Mrs. Willett's subconscious self, drawing its material\nfrom the spiritual world ;\n(3) The mind of some other living person acting on the\nmind of the automatist ;\n(4) Some discarnate spirit using the automatist as a medium\nof communication.\nIt is the last case alone that points unambiguously to the\ndoctrine of personal survival ; for the second case, in which\nwe suppose the planning intelligence to be Mrs. Willett's\nsubconscious self drawing its material from the spiritual\nworld, while not inconsistent with personal survival, would\nbe equally satisfied if the source of the supernormal know-\nledge were some spiritual reservoir of pooled memories, such\nas has been suggested by William James.\nI am not prepared to affirm a priori that any of these ex-\nplanations is so intrinsically improbable as to be straight-\nway ruled out of court. All of them, so far as I can judge,\ninvolve a root-and-branch reconstruction of many present-\nday psychological orthodoxies : and yet one or other of them,\nit would seem, must be admitted, wherever we accept evidence\nof design in the scripts combined with supernormally acquired\nknowledge.\nWhich of the four explanations fits the present case best ?\nI am afraid it is not possible within the limits of this Paper\nto give the question an adequately reasoned answer. A\nspecial case cannot be properly discussed in all its bearings\nwithout an examination of many other more or less similar\ncases, nor without some attempt to estimate the value and\nsignificance of the automatist's script generally.\n\fLXIX.] Evidence of Personal Survival. 235\nThere are, however, some circumstances in connection with\nthe case before us which are not immaterial and may help\ntowards forming an opinion.\nMrs. Willett writes her scripts sometimes alone, sometimes\nwith a sitter present . There was a sitter present on July 6,\n1912, the date on which the first reference to the subject\nappeared. When an automatist is supposed to have derived\ninformation telepathically from the mind of another living\nperson it is naturally on the sitter that suspicion first falls.\nBut the sitter on July 6 Avas myself ; and I can positively\naver not only that I had no idea at that date, or indeed for\na Avhole year afterwards, who the Timid Traveller might be,\nbut that even the bare fact of Dr. Verrall's having \u2022written\non the subject of Dante and Statius Avas completely unknoAAm\nto me.\nThere remain Mrs. Verrall and Miss Verrall\u2014for I cannot\nthink of any other liAang person A\\r\nhose mind Mrs. Willett\ncan plausibly be supposed to have tapped.\nThat one or the other or both of these ladies should haA-e\nbeen the source AAr\nhence Mrs. Willett dreAAr\nher information,\nis a possibility Avhich I do not deny, and which ought not\nto be ignored. If, however, we go further and suppose them\nto have been intelligent agents in the production of the scripts.\nthe difficulties become greater. I doubt Avhether any actual\nfacts can be brought forward tending to show that evidential\ncases have been \" engineered\n:\n'\nby the subliminal self of some\nliving person other than the automatist without the normal\nconsciousness of that person being in any Avay aware of Avhat\nwas going on. Yet this is what the hypothesis compels us\nto assume. Moreover, the particular case we are considering\noffers special difficulties of its OAvn. Neither Mrs. Verrall nor\nMiss Verrall had seen Mrs. Willett for nearly two months\nbefore July 6, 1912 ;\nthey were separated from her by more\nthan a hundred miles when the script of that date AA'as written ;\nfurther, Miss VerraU's acquaintance Avith Willett Scripts is\npractically confined to the very few that have appeared in the\nProceedings ; and Mrs. Verrall AA\nr\nas so innocent of any conscious\nunderstanding of the allusion to the Traveller and the River\nAAhich he AA\nT\nished to cross, that she had not the faintest inkling\nof the interpretation iioav placed on the scripts until she AA^as\n\f230 Right Hon. Gerald W. Balfour. [part\nshown the first sketch of this Paper in November of last year\n(1913).\nI hope these observations may have helped somewhat to\nnarrow the issue ; and there I must leave it so far as argument\nis concerned. If, however, you care to hear a dogmatic ex-\npression of my own personal opinion, I am willing to tell\nyou frankly what I think.\nThe scripts which we owe to the group of automatists of\nwhom Mrs. Verrall, Miss Verrall, and Mrs. Willett are the\nchief, go back for many years now, and require to be con-\nsidered together and as a whole. A long and laborious study\nof them carried on from this point of view has brought me\nslowly but surely to a conviction that there is much in them\nthat cannot be satisfactorily explained except upon the\nspiritistic hypothesis.\nOf course such a conclusion must in its turn affect one's\njudgment concerning any particular episode in the scripts.\nAnd my own sincere belief is that in these allusions to Dr.\nVerrall's essay on \" Dante on the Baptism of Statius \" we\nhave at least the echoes of the voice of one who \" being dead\nyet speaketh.\"\nA few subsidiary points in the scripts still remain to be\nconsidered. Though of secondary importance they are by\nno means without interest ; and their collective effect is to\nconfirm and reinforce the results already arrived at.\nAt the end of Extract (B), from the script of August 13,\n1913, a curious phrase occurs :\nHave this seen to, for he swears that he will not here exercise\nany patience whatsoever ; not even about\nLavender or Lub.\n\" Lavender or Lub\" came in a script of Mrs. Verrall's written\non Jan. 13, 1908. That script had been seen by Mrs. Willett,\nwhich no doubt accounts in part for its appearance here.\nSo much I was aware of ; and I also knew that its original\nsource was some comic verses in Punch. But I was unable\nto form any conjecture respecting its meaning or appropriate-\nness in this place until light was thrown on the subject by\nMrs. Verrall herself. She was shown the script for the first\n\fLXIX.] Evidence of Personal Survival. 237\ntime on November 10, 1913 ; and on the 15th of that month\nshe writes :\n\" Lavender or Lub \" is a quotation from a poem which appeared\nmany years ago in Punch, where several variations were made\non the alternative name for the fish, Chavender or Chub. The\nfines were exceedingly familiar to my husband, and some of the\nphrases had become household words with him, displacing the\nproper terms : during many years, for instance, the mention of\nbathing invariably produced the lines\n\" And when I take my Tavender,\nMy Tavender or Tub.\"\n\" Lavender or Lub \" is presumably introduced to serve\nas an identifying symbol connecting Dr. Verrall with the\nscript by a link the significance of which was outside the\nnormal knowledge of the automatist. For although Mrs.\nWillett knew that \" Lavender or Lub \" had come in a\nVerrall script, she certainly did not know that the phrase\nhad become a standing jest in the intimacy of the family\ncircle. 1\nAnother cryptic but ingenious reference to Dr. Verrall will\nbe found in the next extract, marked (C), from the script\nof August 17, 1913 :\nNot a one-horsed dawn, but a two-horsed chariot, though one-\nhorsed in a way might fit, because as compared to another\ncharioteer's exploits his were but a one-horsed affair. It is a\n1 There is nothing in Mrs. Yen-all's Script of Jan. 13, 1908, to suggest any\nconnection between Dr. Verrall and the phrase \" Lavender or Lub.\" To\nmake this quite clear, I give the Script in full :\n\" Everard not not that name.

But what follows is a riddle\nnot so easy to read until the clue is supplied, when all becomes\nas clear as daylight.\nThe clue is to be found, as the script hints, in a poem\n\u2014\nGray's Ode on the Progress of Poesy. I will quote the passage\nand you will at once perceive the application :\nNor second He, that rode sublime\nUpon the seraph-wings of Extasy\nThe secrets of the abyss to spy.\nHe passed the flaming bounds of place and time ;\nThe living Throne, the sapphire-blaze\nWhere angels tremble while they gaze\nHe saw ; but blasted with excess of light,\nClosed his eyes in endless night.\nBehold where Dryden's less presumptuous car\nWide o'er the fields of glory bear\nTwo coursers of ethereal race,\nWith necks in thunder clothed, and long-resounding pace.\nGray is comparing Dryden with Milton.

The last work on which Dr. Verrall was engaged before\nhis death was a set of lectures on Dryden, in the course of\nwhich this very passage from Gray's Ode was quoted. The\nobject of all these elaborate literary allusions I take to be\nthe identification of Dr. Verrall as the \" communicator \" in\na way that would be apparent to an interpreter of the scripts,\nwhile unintelligible to the normal consciousness of the writer\nof them. It is possible also, though not certain, that the\nallusions show supernormally-acquired knowledge. Mrs. Wil-\nlett doubtless knew that Dr. Verrall was giving lectures on\nEnglish Literature. She told me, in answer to a question,\nthat she was not aware that he had been lecturing on Dryden ;\nand she certainly did not know that the passage from Gray's\nOde had been quoted in the lectures. But it is quite possible\nshe may have heard or read that he had been lecturing on\nDryden without consciously remembering it ; and the refer-\nence to Gray in the scripts may have been a chance coinci-\ndence. The lectures themselves were only published in the\npresent year (1914).\nAnother point : What is the meaning of \" Hair in a\nTemple \" ? Some importance is evidently attached to the\nallusion contained in these words, for they are found in every\none of the three later scripts, and in the last of all with reiterated\nemphasis :\nThen again I will repeat and will continue to repeat until you\nare all sick and tired of the subject, HAIR IN A TEMPLE. That\nbelongs.\nIt is, I think, a fair assumption that the expression \" Hair\nin a Temple \" relates to some story or poem belonging to\nclassical times. There happen to be two, and, so far as I\nknow, only two classical poems to which it can refer. One\nof these is a well-known poem by Catullus, called \" The hair\nof Berenice.\" The other is a poem less well-known, and\nless deserving to be well known, whose author is none other\nthan our friend Statius. That Statius should have written\na poem to which \" Hair in a Temple \" might appropriately\nserve as a title is certainly curious : and it may be that here\nQ\n\f240 Right Hon. Gerald W. Balfour. [part\nwe have the explanation of which we are in search. \" Hair\nin a Temple \" may simply be intended as a hint that Statius\nis in some way connected with the main topic of the script.\nBut while not wholly rejecting this explanation, it is only\nright I should tell you that I do not believe it was what the\nintelligence responsible for the scripts had primarily and\nprincipally in mind. I think we were meant to interpret\nthe scripts as alluding to the Hair of Berenice, which, accord-\ning to the story, she cut off by way of sacrifice for the safe\nreturn home of her husband, and dedicated in a temple ;\nwhence it was transferred to the heavens and became the\nConstellation known to this day as Coma Berenices.\nWhat, then, is the connection between Berenice and the\nhesitating Pilgrim ?\nHere I am in a difficulty, and must bespeak your kind\nindulgence. I must ask you to accept from me that there\nis a connection, but one which I have to leave unexplained,\nbecause it involves a reference to private matters which I\nam not at liberty to disclose. Unfortunately this difficulty\nis one that frequently occurs in dealing with Willett Scripts,\nand diminishes their evidential utility, even when it increases\ntheir intrinsic evidential value.\nI can only tell you that \" Berenice \" is, as a matter of fact,\nconnected by very definite intermediate links with Dr. Verrall's\nessays on Dante and Statius, and that this explanation has\nthe additional merit of explaining why the drawing of a wheel\nappears in the script of August 13, 1913. The intermediate\nlinks have nothing to do with Dr. Verrall himself, and could\nonly be understood by the small group who have been study-\ning the scripts of Mrs. Verrall and Miss Verrall, as well as\nthose of Mrs. Willett. I am sorry I cannot say more on the\nsubject.\nOne additional puzzle and I have finished. It will be\nnoticed that the \" Traveller \" of the script of July 6, 1912,\nis spoken of in the script of August 13, 1913, first as the \" Tra-\nveller,\" and then as the \" Pilgrim.\" In the two latest scripts\nhe appears either as the \" Pilgrim \" or as the \" Passionate\nPilgrim.\" What is the significance of the epithet \" Passionate\"\nthus applied to him ?\nIt is true that it is only applied in a half-hearted and almost\n\flxix.] Evidence of Personal Survival. 241\napologetic way ; and care is taken to guard against the associa-\ntions, literary or otherwise\u2014for instance, those connected\nwith Shakespeare's poem\u2014which may have gathered round\nthe combination of \" Passionate \" with \" Pilgrim \" :\nThe Passionate Pilgrim. But it is of another I want to write.\nI said Pilgrim.\nand again :\nif I say Passionate Pilgrim, I know all sorts of connotations\nwill be dragged in ... a Passionate Pilgrim, but not H.S.'s one.\n\" H. S.\" stands for Henry Sidgwick ; and \" H. S.'s one\n\"\nmust be taken to refer to an early script of Mrs. Verrall's\n(Jan. 17, 1904)\n1\nin which \" the Passionate Pilgrim \" occurs\nin a passage afterwards connected by her with Professor\nSidgwick. This passage was published, together with Mrs.\nVerrall's interpretation of it, in Volume XX. of the Proceed-\nings, and had been seen by Mrs. Willett.\nBut what does \" Passionate \" mean here, if these associa-\ntions are excluded ?\nIt may perhaps be nothing more than an unauthorised\ncontribution on the part of the automatist, the \" Pilgrim \" of\nthe communicator having suggested to her mind the \" Pas-\nsionate Pilgrim.\"\nAnother explanation, however, seems to me possible, and\neven probable. It is that the passage describing the hesi-\ntation of the Pilgrim to cross the river carries with it a personal\nreference to the communicator. The communicator in some\nsense identifies himself with the Pilgrim ; and the mock\nindignation and impatience which he professes at our failure\nto discover the passage for which he bade us search, is\nhumorously carried on into the description of him as a Pas-\nsionate Pilgrim :\nSome one indignant at the delaj^ calls out HAS THE\nPASSAGE been identified ?\nand again :\nHave this seen to, for he swears he will not here exercise any\npatience whatsoever, not even about Lavender or Lub.\n1\nSee Proc. Vol. XX., p. 289.\n\f242 Right Hon. Gerald W. Balfour. [part\nSimilarly in the last extract :\n\" He of the little patience\ndemands now this 3rd time, etc.\"\nWho then is \"he of the little patience\"? About this\nthere can, I think, be no doubt. It is clearly Dr. Verrall\nhimself ; and if my interpretation of the Passionate Pilgrim\nis right, there must be some sense in which the autobiographical\nreferences discovered (according to the view of the essay)\nby Dante in the lines from Statius' Thebaid about the crossing\nof the river, must have a personal application to Dr. Verrall\nas well. He must be representing himself as in some way\na Statius, or Stayer on the brink.\nI think, too, the words in the script of August 13, 1913,\nwhich I have just quoted confirm this idea :\n\" Have this\nseen to, for he swears that he will not here exercise any patience\nwhatsoever.\" \" Not here \" seems to signify that during life\nin the body patience was exercised ; and the word \" Faith\n\"\noccurring in the same script may be intended to denote the\nsubject with which the exercise of patience was concerned.\nCould the River which the Pilgrim was afraid to cross,\nand which for Statius was the River of Baptism, have been\nfor Dr. Verrall the River of Faith in a life hereafter, and in\nthe reality of communication from \" the further shore \" ?\nThe suggestion here made receives some support from a\nstatement which Mrs. Verrall prepared for me, and which\nI am permitted to reproduce :\nMy husband's interest in Psychical Research was mainly due,\nas has been said by Mr. Bayfield in the recently published Memoir,\nto his desire to \" encourage every investigation which gave promise\nof tangible fruit \" ; and for many years after the development\nof my faculty of automatic writing he dejorecated as premature\nany attempt to frame even a \" working hypothesis \" to account\nfor what seemed difficult to attribute to telepathy between living\nminds. But he was greatly impressed by some of the more recently\nrecorded phenomena ; \u2014in particular by the evidence of classical\nknowledge shown by Myersp in the sittings of Mr. Dorr with Mrs.\nPiper during the spring of 1908, as suggestive of the identity of\nthe supposed communicator and so pointing to what may be briefly\ncalled the \" spiritistic hypothesis.\" This impression was deepened\non his receipt of a \" message \" claiming to come from a personal\n\fLXIX.] Evidence of Personal Survival. 243\nfriend, recently dead, in a Willett Script of Oct. 29, 1911, which\nwas sent to him within a few days of its production, and was further\nconfirmed by a talk which he had with Mr. Gerald Balfour in\nJanuary, 1912, of which he spoke to me at the time, and to which\nhe often subsequently referred.\nHis interest in the subject was further shown by his choice for\nreading in March, 1912, first of William James's Varieties of Religious\nExperience, which he had not read when it appeared and which\nfilled him with admiration for what he called James's \" magnificent\ncandour,\" and later of Mrs. Sidgwick's Paper in an early volume\nof the Proceedings (Vol. III.) on the Evidence collected by the Society\nfor Phantasms of the Dead.\nThe question of his personal opinions was not at this time dis-\ncussed between us, but some months ago, after his death, an inti-\nmate friend of his told me that something which my husband\nsaid made the hearer think that he believed in the continuance\nof existence after death.\nLet me say in conclusion that, in suggesting that an analogy\nis intended between Dr. Verrall's personal attitude and that\nof the pilgrim who shrinks from plunging into the stream.\nI do not wish to insist unduly on this reading of the script,\nor to have it regarded as in any way essential to the main\ncontention of my Paper. It may be that, like Dante's Statius,\nI have \" put forth my hand to fill in colour,\" and done so\nwithout sufficient warrant. But I cannot help feeling \" se\nnon e vero, e ben trovato \" ; and that the interpretation\nis one which puts a finishing and as it were artistic touch\nto a message which must in any case take high rank among\nthe evidences provided by automatic writings of the reality\nof communication from the departed.\n\f244 Rev. M. A. Bayfield. [part\nIII.\nNOTE ON THE SAME SCRIPTS.\nBy the Rev. M. A. Bayfield.\nIn a closely reasoned and characteristically lucid argument Mr.\nBalfour has shown good grounds for his belief that the late\nDr. Verrall is the original source of the scripts which are here\nbrought to our notice. For this conclusion there are yet other\nreasons. They were present to Mr. Balfour's mind, but as he\nsaid at the meeting at which he read his paper, he did not\nenlarge upon them because he thought they would come better\nfrom some one not the author of the paper, who might be\nthought to be unduly influenced by a desire to make out a\ncase. The imputation is one to which no one could be less\nliable than he, but personally I regret his abstention the less\nsince it has given me an opportunity of contributing some-\nthing to the discussion of a communication which I, too,\nbelieve to have come from my oldest and dearest friend.\nAlso, having at various times for some years past expressed\nin these pages doubt and hesitation as to the proof of com-\nmunication with the spirit world, I venture to seize the\noccasion and here make formal recantation of those doubts.\nThe present scripts, following on Miss Johnson's recently\npublished elucidation of the cross-correspondence entitled\n\" Alexander's Tomb,\" have furnished this \" timid traveller\n\"\nwith a bridge by which to cross the stream.\nThese additional reasons for assigning to Dr. Verrall the\nscripts which we are examining can, I fear, be fully appre-\nciated only by those who knew him somewhat intimately, for\nthey consist in the exhibition in the scripts of two traits of\nhis personality which, highly characteristic though they are,\nwould not be likely to come under the notice of an ordinary\nacquaintance, or be known by hearsay to a stranger. Since\n\fXiXIX.] Note on the same Scripts. 245\nmany readers of the foregoing paper can only have known Dr.\nVerrall by repute, this note is appended, at Mr. Balfour's\nsuggestion, in the hope of further assisting such readers to\nform an independent judgement on the whole matter.\nIt will be convenient to begin by repeating Mr. Balfour's\nimportant statement that Mrs. Willett's acquaintance with\nDr. Verrall was very slight. It was, in fact, limited to a visit\nof three days in the late summer of 1910, when she first met\nhim, another of two days in 1911, and an interview of a few\nminutes in 1912 ; and Mrs. Verrall is sure that she could not\nat these visits have discovered either of the first two points\ndiscussed below. Mr. Balfour, who was very intimate with\nVerrall in old days when they were young together, and who\nis also personally acquainted with Mrs. Willett, is equally\ncertain that nothing said by him to her could account for the\nimpersonation presented in the scripts.\nFor the last fifteen years of his life Dr. Verrall suffered\nfrom arthritis. The disease gradually increased in severity,\ndepriving him more and more of the use of his limbs, and after\nthe spring of 1910 he was unable to walk ; fresh loss of power\nin the hands followed, and he could now with difficulty turn\nthe leaves of a book. These painful and steadily increasing\nphysical disabilities he bore with an uncomplaining patience\nwhich excited the amazement and admiration of all who came\nin contact with him ; he did not even allow them to inter-\nfere with the continuance of his literary work. Now, it was\njust when this exhibition of fortitude was most remarkable\nthat Mrs. Willett first met him, and it cannot be doubted\nthat his extraordinary patience would have been the charac-\nteristic by which, either at this time or later, a visitor would\nbe most impressed. This, my own independent opinion, is\nconfirmed by Mrs. Verrall, who writes, after seeing a draft of\nthis note :\n\" Mrs. Willett's own normal impression of A. was,\nI know from what she has said, mainly the patience with which\nhe bore his disqualifications and sufferings, and of the way in\nwhich he was '\nCaptain of his soul.' \" But the scripts describe\nhim as showing a considerable degree of impatience, and the\npeculiar kind of impatience indicated was, in fact, in the\nearlier days of health and high spirits, a noticeable feature of\niis character. It signalises a Verrall very different from the\n\f246 Rev. M. A. Bayfield. [part\none Mrs. Willett knew. It was not the impatience of irrita-\ntion, but that of eagerness and keen interest ; there was\nnothing querimonious about it. It emerged in all sorts of\ncircumstances and in all sorts of ways, and especially in a\nconversation or discussion (with intimates only, for with others\nhe was always courtesy itself) when your thought did not travel\nso quickly as his own, or with the rapidity which he expected\nof you. Or it would be evoked when, as in the scripts, he\nhad reason to fear that something which could and ought to\nhave been done at once had not been done ; or again, when\nhe was anxious to have some preliminary point settled and\ncleared out of the way in order that the talk might get on to\nthe main issue. The thing I mean does not readily lend itself\nto definition, but it was eminently characteristic, and no one\nwho had engaged with him in intimate talk could fail to be\nstruck by it. A number of examples would perhaps make it\nclearer, but for that there is not space here, and it must suffice\nto say that all the specimens in the scripts are typical :\n\" HAS THE PASSAGE\nbeen identified about the traveller looking across a stream ;\n\"\netc., in (B) ;\n\" That ought to make it clear,\" in (C) ;\n\" Now\nif I say Passionate Pilgrim I know all sorts of connotations\nwill be dragged in \" (a peculiarly Verrallian remark) ; and\n\" Then again I will repeat and will continue to repeat until\nyou are all sick and tired of the subject\nHAIR IN A TEMPLE \"\nin (D). All this is VerralFs manner to the life in animated\nconversation. On the other hand, the terse completeness of\nthe description in the first paragraph of (A) is equally in his\ncarefully ordered style when stating a case, and the phrase\n\" and yet desiring to be at his destination \" is an admirable\nillustration of his somewhat stately way of putting a simple\nfact in a considered exposition. When I first read the words\nquoted above I received a series of little shocks, for the turns\nof speech are Verrall's, the high-pitched emphasis is his, and\nI could hear the very tones in which he would have spoken\neach sentence. The crescendo at the end of (D) was perhaps\nthe most startling instance : I can see the amused smile on\n\fLXIX.] Note on the same Scripts. 247\nhis face and the merriment flashing from his eyes as he shouts\nout with all the gaminerie of a mischievous child,\n\"HAIR IN A TEMPLE.\"\nDuring the discussion on Mr. Balfour's paper at the meeting\nat which it was read, both he and Dr. Leaf\u2014also an intimate\nfriend of Verrall from undergraduate days\u2014concurred with\nme as to this impression made by the language and tone of the\nscripts ; and after the meeting a niece of Dr. Verrall told me\nshe had had a similar experience. Mrs. Verrall has since\nwritten that she is altogether in accord with us, and doubtless\nmany others would testify to the same effect.\nSince Mrs. Willett, before writing scripts (B), (C), and (D),\nhad read the Memoir prefixed to the volume of essays to which\nMr. Balfour has referred, it is important to state that no\nmention is there made of this salient trait of intellectual\nimpatience, though it was vividly present to my mind when\nI wrote, \" Easily roused though he was even to excitement\nwhen holding forth on some matter which greatly interested\nhim, his usual maimer was extremely gentle.\" Verrall's\nnatural gaiety and love of fun are indeed dwelt upon at some\nlength, but nothing is said of the particular point with which\nI now proceed to deal,\n\u2014\" Lavender or Lub.\"\nAs a mark of identification, the reference to \" Lavender or\nLub \" is as convincing as the impatience. Verrall had a rare\nand always alert sense of the comic (see Script B), and his\nfine appreciation of the noblest in literature did not prevent\nhis deriving the keenest delight from clever nonsense, and\nespecially from humorous or frankly nonsensical verse. He is\nthe only man I ever met who enjoyed it quite in the same way\nand to the same extent as myself,\u2014that is to say, an extent\nwhich seems to permit of no increase without danger of dis-\nintegration. If we were together and one of us read aloud\nsomething very good after its kind\u2014something in which the\ncombination of rhythm and assonance and rime and sense (or\nnonsense) left nothing to be desired, there would be no inter-\nruptions for the expression of our enjoyment, but like two\nconnoisseurs sipping a wine of choice vintage, we would merely\nexchange a series of rapturous winks. When a contributor to\nPunch, having found the full designation of the fish commonly\n\f248 Rev. M. A. Bayfield. [part\nknown as the chub to be \" the chavender or chub,\" published\nthe little poem in which he properly sought to extend this\ndelicious type of synonym\u2014writing of \" lavender or lub,\ngravender or grub, pavender or pub,\" etc., etc., the idea was\nimmediately recognised as one of great merit, and from that\ntime onward, until he ceased to be able to walk (January,\n1910), Verrall habitually described his bath, the taking of\nAvhich had become a serious effort, as his \" tavender or tub.\"\nNow, as has been said, Mrs. Willett did not make Verrall's\nacquaintance until the late summer of 1910, and Mrs. Verrall\nis quite sure that all allusions to \" lavender or lub \" ceased\nafter her husband's serious illness in the early part of that\nyear ;\njokes had become very rare, and she doubts whether\nMrs. Willett ever heard him laugh. It appears to be an irresis-\ntible conclusion that no one but Verrall himself, who, as we\nhave seen, is unmistakably delineated throughout the scripts,\ncould have furnished this peculiarly ingenious touch.\nBoth the points which we have been considering may be\nfurther illustrated by the narration of an incident which\noccurred about the year 1906. Verrall, who was on a visit\nto us, was sitting by himself on the lawn, looking through old\nvolumes of Punch, when he caught sight of me coming from\nthe house. \" Oh, Bayfield,\" he cried (and the voice was so\nurgent that I began to quicken my pace), \" come here ! Come\nhere and listen to this !\n\" He had found \" The Three Judges.\nA song of the Parnell Commission. Air\n\u2014' The Three Ravens,'\n\"\n(vol. 97, p. 194), and when I got to him, chuckling with delight\nso that he could hardly go on, he read through the whole\npoem, of which the following is the opening verse :\nThere were three Judges sat on a bench,\nDown a down, hey-down, hey-down ;\nAnd from their task they all did blench,\nWith a down.\nAnd one of them said to the others,\n\" Oh, here's a bore, my learned Brothers ;\nWith a down derry, derry, derry down down.\"\nThe point which, judging by myself, I think tickled him most,\nthe Derry and the Down, he brought out with ever increasing\nemphasis until at last it became a shout (see end of Script D).\n\fLXIX.] Note on the same Scripts. 249\nIt remains to mention one more point which also impresses\nme strongly. We have here an extraordinarily faithful repre-\nsentation of Verrall in respect of a peculiar kind of impatience\nand a habit of emphasis which he had in conversation, and\nof his playfulness and sense of humour. In what way are\nthese life-like touches of character introduced ? How are\nthey worked into the essential matter of the scripts ? Have\nthey the air of being inserted by an ingenious forger (the\nunprincipled subliminal of some living person) with a purpose,\nin order to lend convincing vraisemblance to a fictitious im-\npersonation ; or do they give us the impression of being\nspontaneous and genuine ? Unless I am inexcusably mistaken,\nno one accustomed to estimate the internal evidence afforded\nby a document of doubtful origin could hesitate as to the\nanswer. Note how simply and naturally the first hint of the\nimpatience which we have been discussing emerges at the\nbeginning of Script (B) :\n\" Some one indignant at the delay\ncalls out,\" etc. Surely this is the language of sincerity,\u2014of\none who, so far from lying \" with malice aforethought,\" is\nhonestly describing what he has before him, what he actually\nsees and hears. Nor can I find in all that is said by the \" some\none indignant \" throughout the scripts any touch that betrays\nartificiality, any '\nfault ' in the close contexture of matter and\nmanner. Nowhere is there any slip which would justify the\nsuspicion that in reality we have to do with a cunningly\nmasquerading '\nsub.' Neither the impatience, nor the em-\nphatic utterance, nor the playfulness has anywhere the appear-\nance of being '\nput on,'\u2014of being separable from the matter\nof the scripts. \" Assume a virtue, if you have it not,\" is no\ndoubt a motto which an enterprising subliminal would not\nforget, but to me at least it is incredible that even the cleverest\ncould achieve such an unexampled triumph in deceptive\nimpersonation as this would be if the actor is not Verrall\nhimself.\n\f250 Helen cle G. Verrall. [part\nIV.\nA FURTHER STUDY OF THE MAC SCRIPTS.\nBy Helen de G. Verrall.\nMr. and Miss \" Mac,\" it will be remembered, were two of the\nautomatists who took part in the cross-correspondence on\n\" Sesame and Lilies \" (see Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXIV., pp.\n264 et seq.). The present paper is concerned with some later\nscripts of theirs and with certain connexions between these\nscripts and some written by Mrs. Verrall and myself. The\ncircumstances under which the earlier cross-correspondence\non \" Sesame and Lilies \" occurred are worth recalling here,\nbecause they add to the interest of other phenomena con-\nnected with Mr. and Miss Mac.\nMr. and Miss Mac are not members of the S.P.R. and were\nquite unknown to my mother and me until in September,\n1908, Miss Mac sent my mother the records of some plan-\nchette writing obtained by herself and other members of her\nfamily, chiefly her brother. This she did in consequence of\ndefinite and repeated injunctions given in the planchette\nwriting to \" send the messages to Mrs. Verrall.\" These\nrecords showed a definite correspondence of topic with scripts\nrecently produced by my mother and me. Since that time\nmy mother has occasionally corresponded with Miss Mac, but\nwe have never met either Miss Mac or her brother. The\nadditional interest which the earlier phenomena derive from\nthe fact that Mr. and Miss Mac were complete strangers to the\nother automatists concerned, extends, therefore, in a measure,\nto these later phenomena.\nThe scripts involved are (a) four scripts of my own written\nbetween January and March, 1911, sent to the Rooms of the\nS.P.R. and not seen by Mrs. Verrall till August 20, 1911, (6)\n\flxix.] A Further Study of the Mac Scripts. 251\nthree scripts written by Mrs. Verrall in June, 1911, and (c)\nfive scripts written by Mr. and Miss Mac in July and Sep-\ntember, 1911, of which the first three were received by Mrs.\nVerrall on July 12, 1911, and the remaining two on September\n12, 1911. I did not see either Mrs. Verrall's scripts of June,\n1911, or the Mac scripts of July and September, 1911, till\nOctober 6, 1912. The connexions of thought constituting the\ncross-correspondence are to be found chiefly in the Mac scripts\nand mine, the part contributed by Mrs. Verrall's scripts being\nslighter and less definite. It will be noticed that between\nthe last of my scripts and the first of the Mac scripts there\nis an interval of more than three months, but this interval\nmay be to a great extent discounted, because July 7, 1911,\nwas the first occasion for more than a year, upon which Mr.\nand Miss Mac obtained any script purporting to come from\nHenry Sidgwick, the only one of their supposed controls\nwho has ever been associated with the production of cross-\ncorrespondences. The other scripts written by them during\n1911\u2014not a large amount\u2014are of a totally different char-\nacter, and we may for our present purpose ignore them, and\nregard the script of July 7, 1911, as the first script produced\nby Mr. and Miss Mac after my scripts of January and March,\n1911. That being so, no great importance need be attached\nto the interval of time.\nI will first quote four scripts of my own, written on January\n25, February 28, March 10 and March 14, 1911.\n(H.

That objection cannot be raised\nin this instance. In the first place the whole amount of\nmaterial to be considered is small. Between November, 1910,\nand March, 1911, I wrote only seven pieces of script, which\nare divided from the rest of my script by an interval of two\nmonths on one side and four on the other, so that they may be\nregarded as constituting a group by themselves. Moreover,\nthe four scripts of this period, which I quoted just now, are\nnot arbitrarily selected. Quite apart from the question of\nwhether they give evidence of supernormal connexion with\nthe script of other automatists, they can be shown to have a\nnormal connexion with one another through the recurrence\nof the same or closely similar ideas and phrases. These ideas\nand phrases, which they share with each other, they do not\nshare with the other scripts of this period, so that we are\n1\nTennyson, Princess : Last Song.\n2\nTennyson, Maud, I. xxii.\n3\nCf.

[part\njustified on internal evidence alone in regarding these four\nscripts as a distinct sequence,\u2014distinct, that is to say, from the\nother scripts of this period. In order to make my meaning\nclear, I must analyse the four scripts which I have quoted\nabove.\nThe script of January 25, 1911, the first in the series, contains\nthe phrases :\nthe apple of discord\u2014the fruit of the tree . . .\nno sound was heard\nA leaf couch\u2014in the depths of the forest\n\u2014\nand later,\nThe winding of the thread the whirling spindle.\nThis last phrase and the allusion to the \" fruit of the tree,\"\nlink it with the second script on February 28, 1911, which\nalludes to a spinning wheel and to the garden of Eden.\nThe third script, on March 10, 1911, has :\nI cannot hear\u2014in the depths,\nwhich recalls\nno sound was heard ... in the depths of the forest.\nThe first script, therefore, has points of connexion both with\nthe second and with the third.\nThe second script, moreover, contains the words :\nthe first fruits of Time, a\u2014a\\>6' 6 \/xaxpos navapiOyu^-os \\p6vo<;. [All\nthings long unnumbered Time]\nThe Greek words are a quotation from the Ajax of Sophocles ;\nthe passage runs :\n\" All things long unnumbered Time brings\nto light when they are hidden, and hides when they are mani-\nfest \" ; and might be briefly paraphrased as describing \" the\ntriumph of Time.\" The. second script is therefore closely\nlinked to the fourth script on March 14, 1911, which has :\nThe triumph of Time\nIt is not much that a man may save, etc.\nThe fourth script also contains the phrases :\nA solemn music\u2014harmonies of ancient days\u2014a broken lute.\nNo more no never more,\n\fLXIX.] A Further Study of the Mac Scripts. 255\nwhich we may compare with the opening words of the third\nscript :\nThe tune\u2014the old tune\u2014once again.\nMoreover the phrase \" No more no never more,\" being an\nalmost exact quotation from Shelley's poem 0 World, 0 Life,\nO Time, contains another implicit allusion to Time.\nThere is a further connexion of thought between these\nscripts, which did not become apparent until some time after-\nwards.\nThe first script on January 25, 1911, opens with the words :\nCloth of gold\u2014the king's purple\n'Twas a royal train put forth to sea\nBut the tale can be told by none but me.\nThese lines are a quotation from Rossetti's ballad The White\nShip, in which he tells the story of the drowning of Henry I.'s\nonly son on his way back from France.\nThis quotation appears once again in my script on September\n25, 1911, which begins :\n'Twas a royal train put forth to sea\nBut the tail [sic] can be told by none but me\nYouth at the prow and pleasure at the helm.1\natrox incubat cura [Fierce care oppresses.]\nthe uncertainty of human fate\nthat is one idea I want to get\u2014now the other\u2014it is a parallel\npassage\na sunless sea\u2014write that it will help ....\nThis script may be paraphrased thus : the quotation from\nThe White Ship and the idea expressed by it, \u2014which is re-\npeated in the quotation from Gray and summed up in the\nwords \" the uncertainty of human fate,\"\u2014are to be com-\npared with a parallel passage, and the words \" a sunless sea\n\"\nwill in some way help to identify this passage.\n1\nCf. Gray, The Bard :\n\" In gallant trim the gilded vessel goes ;\nYouth on the prow, and Pleasure at the helm ;\nRegardless of the sweeping whirlwind's sway,\nThat, hush'd in grim repose, expects his evening prey.\"\nR\n\f256 Helen de G. Verrall. [part\nThe Latin words in this script, atrox incubat cura, are an\nunmistakeable, though inaccurate, allusion to the famous\npassage in the Odes of Horace, in which he speaks of black\ncare sitting at the horseman's back,1\natra cura, not atrox.\nThe quotation is familiar to me, and I should not normally\nmisquote it, as I do in the script. Nevertheless the same\nmisquotation appears in another of my scripts (and only in\nthat one other) on April 15, 1912. Thus :\nAtrox cura [Fierce care.]\nimminente luna 2\n[When the moon hangs overhead.]\nnon ebur neque aureo 3\n[Not ivory nor with gold]\nnemesis\u2014the mills of God grind slowly\nSwinburne\u2014a parallel\nIt is not much that a man can save\n\u2014\nWithin the compass of a hand.\nThe three Odes of Horace, to which this script refers, all\nturn upon the subject of Nemesis, or, as it was expressed in\nthe earlier script, the uncertainty of human fate, and these\nquotations lead up to the words :\nSwinburne\u2014a parallel\nIt is not much that a man can save.\nThis script is linked to the script of September 25, 1911,\nby the misquotation atrox cura, and therefore there is no doubt,\nI think, that in its quotation from Swinburne (\" It is not\nmuch that a man can save \") we have the \" parallel passage\n\"\nto which the earlier script as follows refers :\n(H. V. script of September 25, 1911.)\nthe uncertainty of human fate\nthat is one idea I want to get\u2014now the other.\u2014it is a parallel\npassage\na sunless sea\u2014write that it will help.\nIt may fairly be said that the words \" a sunless sea \" will\n\" help \" towards identifying the passage required, because\nHorace, C.

II. 18 ;\n\" Non ebur neque aureum.\"\n\fLXIX.] A Further Study of the Mac Scripts. 257\nnot only does the particular verse from The Triumph of Time,\nwhich is afterwards quoted, refer to the sea, but this idea is\nprominent throughout the whole poem, as it is in so much of\nSwinburne's work. In the first verse we have :\n\" Time swift to fasten and swift to sever\nHand from hand, as we stand by the sea,\"\nand later :\n\" I will go back to the great sweet mother,\nMother and lover of men, the sea.\"\nand again :\n\" There lived a singer in France of old\nBy the fadeless dolorous midland sea.\"\nThe two poems, The White Ship and The Triumph of\nTime, present several possible points of comparison, and the\nquotations given in the script clearly bring out one of these\npoints.\nIn Swinburne we have :\n\" It is not much that a man can save\nOn the sands of life, on the shoals of Time,\nWho swims in sight of the great third wave,\nThat never a swimmer shall cross or climb.\"\nand in Rossetti :\n\" By none but me can the tale be told,\nThe butcher of Rouen, poor Berold.\n(Lands are swayed by a king on a throne.)\n'Twas a royal train put forth to sea,\nYet the tale can be told by none but me.\n(The sea hath no king but God alone.)\n\"\nRossetti's sea is the real sea ; Swinburne's is metaphorical,\nthe sea of Time ; but both are represented as forces against\nwhich human beings strive in vain.\nI have thought it worth while to discuss these later scripts\nof mine for two reasons. In the first place, they show that\nthere is a closer connexion of thought between the earlier\n\f258 Helen cle G. Verrall. [part\nscripts than would otherwise appear. The first script of the\nseries, on January 25, 1911, begins :\nCloth of gold\u2014the king's purple\n'Twas a royal train put forth to sea\nBut the tale can be told by none but me.\nThe last of the series, on March 14, 1911, has :\nThe triumph of Time\nIt is not much that a man may save, etc.\nThe statements found in the subsequent scripts make it\nvery probable that the idea of drawing a parallel between\nRossetti's poem and Swinburne's was already latent in the\nscripts of January and March, 1911. Moreover, the date at\nwhich my script returned to this idea is worth noting. It was\non September 25, 1911, that my script opened with the words :\n'Twas a royal train, etc.\nand it was on September 25, 1911, that Mrs. Verrall, after\nreading the various scripts discussed here, completed the\nnotes from which this paper has been written. To the opening\nwords of my script of January 25, 1911,\nCloth of gold\u2014the king's purple\n'Twas a royal train put forth to sea\nshe appended a note :\nCf. Swinburne, Triumph of Time :\n\" Drowned gold and purple\nand royal rings.\"\nAt that time and for many months afterwards I knew\nnothing of the Mac scripts of July and September beyond\nthe fact that they had been written and sent to my mother.\nI did not see the scripts, or my mother's notes on them, until\nOctober 6, 1912, i.e., some months later than any of the scripts\ndiscussed here.\nMy second reason for discussing these later scripts of mine\nis that they afford a good illustration of one of the characteristics\nof automatic writing, or at least of some automatic writing,\nthe way in which a train of thought may be persistently evolved\n\fLXIX.] A Further Study of the Mac Scripts. 259\nin the script, in a fragmentary way, perhaps, and at consider-\nable intervals of time, but so that it can be traced by following\nthe clues afforded by the script itself.\nSo far, then, I have tried to establish on internal evidence\nthat there is a close connexion of thought linking together four\nscripts of mine written between January and March, 1911. I\nturn now to the scripts contributed by Mr. and Miss Mac.\nOn July 5, 1911, Miss Mac received the then recently issued\nnumber of the Proceedings of this Society, Part LXIIL, and\nat once read the papers on Mrs. Willett's and Mrs. Holland's\nscripts, in which she Was specially interested, because they\ncontained some references to her own earlier scripts. On\nJuly 7, 1911, for the first time for more than a year, she and\nher brother obtained script purporting to be from Henry\nSidgwick. They had made several attempts to obtain script\nearlier in the year, but on almost all these occasions, the only\none of their supposed controls who purported to communicate\nwas \" Bell,\" who is thus described by Miss Mac :\n.... Ellen Bell seemed to be a perfect lunatic, as indeed the\nother controls said she was. . . . She has her own line of riddles,\nepigrams, Limericks, etc., . . . She draws clever caricatures of\nour acquaintances . . . she appears to be quite subliminal and\nvaries in character with the various writers.1\nOnce or twice a little \" Italian \" script was obtained which\nMiss Mac describes as \" rather like an intermediate stage\nbetween Bell and H. S.\"\nAs the script of July 7, 1911, was obtained immediately after\nreading Part LXIIL of the Proceedings, and probably to some\nextent at least in consequence of the stimulus thus given, it\nbecomes a matter of interest to consider what were the contents\nof the articles read by Miss Mac and whether they had any\nperceptible influence on the scripts produced. But it will be\nmore convenient to discuss this question after I have dealt\nin detail with the contents of the scripts.\nThere are five Mac scripts in this period, a group of three\non July 7, 8, and 9, 1911, and two more on September 2 and 6,\n1911. I will first quote the three July scripts.\n1\nSee Proc. S.P.B., Vol. XXIV. p. 265.\n\f260 Helen de G. Verrall.

There are seven certain refer-\nences to his poems, and one that is doubtful. Of these allusions\nthe most important is in the script of July 8, 1911 :\nThink of Swinburne and it all comes what the others are all\ngetting at. It is him. About dead fancies and spoilt rimes [sic]\nand lost faces and sad farewells\nabout Time about ruined rimes\na broken song spoilt music a ruined rhyme\nThere is no doubt that the script is here alluding to the\nsame verse from The Triumph of Time which is quoted in the\nH. V. script of March 14, 1911. The verse runs :\n\"It is not much that a man can save,\nOn the sands of life, on the shoals of Time,\nWho swims in sight of the great third wave,\nThat never a swimmer shall cross or climb ;\nSome waif washed up with the strays and spars,\nThat ebb-tide shows to the shore and stars.\nWeed from the water, grass from a grave,\nA broken blossom, a ruined rhyme.\"\nThe two scripts are complementary, because, whereas the\nH. V. script emotes the first four lines of the verse, the Mac\nscript refers to the last line.\nIt should also be noted that this passage in the Mac script\nis definitely claimed as a cross-correspondence ; thus\n:\nThink of Swinburne and it all comes what the others are all\ngetting at.\n\fLXIX.] A Further Study of the Mac Scripts. 263\nThis point is important, in view of the fact that the Mac\nscripts of this period are full of references to Swinburne. If\nthe claim to a cross-correspondence were not made here\u2014and\nonly here\u2014it might be said that there was no reason for\nsingling out this allusion to Swinburne rather than any of\nthe others.\nHere, then, we have the closest and most definite point of\nconnexion between the Mac script and mine, but there are\nseveral other connexions still to be considered, which afford\ninteresting corroborative evidence of design in the choice of\ntopics.\nIn the Mac script of July 9, 1911, there are two allusions\nto Swinburne's poem Atalanta in Calydon. There is first a\nquotation from the second chorus :\nThe beginning of years,\nthe context of which is interesting. The chorus runs :\n\" Before the beginning of years\nThere came to the making of man\nTime, with his gift of tears, etc.\"\nThe script, therefore, is still harping on the notion of time.\nThen later in the same script we have :\nThe psean of spring Atalanta and the hounds of the hunter.\nTaking into consideration the fact that we have here an\nundoubted allusion to the first chorus of Atalanta :\n\" When the hounds of spring are on winter's traces,\"\nI think there is probably an attempt to quote from it in the\nscript written two days before, on July 7, 1911 :\nI return for a little with a gathered flower when the air is green\nwith summer.\nThus in the green growth of hedge and coppice.\nThis last phrase recalls the lines from the first chorus of\nAtalanta :\n'\n' And in green underwood and cover\nBlossom by blossom the spring begins.\"\n\f264 Helen de G. Verrall. [paet\nThe line in the script is very clumsy, but it is metrically\nequivalent to Swinburne's line, having four principal accents.\nWe might read :\nThus in the green growth of hedge and coppice, 1\nBlossom by blossom the spring begins.\nand \" the green growth of hedge and coppice \" certainly suggests\nan inaccurate recollection of\n\"green underwood and cover.\" 2\nThe point is interesting when we remember that the H. V.\nscript of January 25, 1911, the first of the four scripts which\nI have quoted above, has :\nA leaf couch in the depths of the forest\n\u2014\nand in green underwood and cover blossom by blossom the\nspring begins.\nThe mere fact that the same poem is quoted in two scripts\nis hardly enough to constitute a cross-correspondence between\nthem, but the H. V. script of January 25, 1911, has another\npoint of connexion with the Mac script of July 9, 1911, the\nscript, that is to say, in which there is an explicit allusion to\nthe first chorus of Atalanta.\nJust before the quotation from this chorus, the H. V. script\nhas :\nA barred gate nothing more.\nThe Mac script of July 9, 1911, begins :\nI am he that endureth\n(Draiving of a gate.)\nAllusions to a gate run all through the Mac scripts of this\nperiod. The drawing of a gate, reproduced above, p. 260,\n1\nCf. another line in the chorus :\n''Fills the shadows and windy places.\"\n2\nIt has been suggested that the phrase '\n' the green growth of hedge and\ncoppice \" may be a reminiscence of a line from Swinburne's poem The Garden\nof Proserpine, ..\nNo growth of m00r or COppice\n- .\nor perhaps the phrase is due to a mental fusion of this line and the line from\nAtalanta in Calydon, quoted above.\n\fLXIX.] A Further Study of the Mac Scripts. 265\nappears first at the beginning of the script of July 8, 191 1.\n1\nThe script goes on :\nThe meaning I want is the gate which I have hinted ....\n{Drawing of a gate) I have important words\nThink of Swinburne and it all comes what the others are all\ngetting at.\nThen follows the allusion to The Triumph of Time.\nThe script of July 9, 1911, begins :\nI am he that endureth\n(Draiving of a gate.)\n. . .

S.\nThe latter part of this second script may be summarised\nas a series of allusions to hands and to Shakespeare, culminating\nin a quotation, which combines these two ideas, the opening-\nlines of Ariel's song :\n\" Come unto these yellow sands\nAnd there take hands.\"\nHaving reached this point, the script ceases, which suggests\nthat the earlier allusions were all leading up to this by a series\nof associated ideas. The various stages of this process are\ninteresting.\nThe idea of hands first emerged in several drawings of\nhands and rings and a quotation from Swinburne's Aholibah\nin which the word hands is underlined. Then after a digression\nthe script returns to the idea in the quotation from The Sensitive\nPlant\n:\n'\n' The wind was his whip\nOne choppy finger was on his lip.\"\nThe same idea is persistently emphasised in the quotation\nfrom Omar Khayyam, \" the rosy-fingered dawn,\" and \" your\nhand is imperfect.\" Then we get the first suggestion of\nShakespeare in a quotation from The Merry Wives. The next\nphrase \" there's straw in my hair \" was associated by the\nautomatists with Shakespeare, as they believed it to be a\nquotation from King Lear. The words do not occur in the\n1\nCf. Acts, iii. 6.\n3\nSwinburne, Rococo.\n2\nCf.

Then, after another\nshort digression, we find a quotation from the Acts, leading\nby a natural association of ideas to an inaccurate reminiscence\nof a passage in St. Matthew. The context of these two passages\nshows an even closer connexion between them than is apparent\nin the script :\n\" Silver and gold have I none ; but such as I have, give\nI thee.\" (Acts, hi. 6.)\n\" Freely ye have received, freely give. Provide neither gold\nnor silver nor brass in your purses.\" (Matt., x. 8.)\nThe reminiscence from St. Matthew introduces for the first\ntime the word take. This, followed by an allusion to laughter,\nleads to the quotation from Swinburne :\n\" Take hands and part with laughter,\"\nand this again to the quotation from Shakespeare :\n'\n' Come unto these yellow sands\nAnd then take hands.\"\nWe find in the script three separate streams of thought,\n\" hands,\" \" Shakespeare,\" \" take,\" successively introduced\nand finally combined. It is worth noting that in the quotation\nfrom St. Matthew the word take has been substituted for the\nword give, thereby completely altering the sense of the passage\nand throwing a special emphasis on to this word. There are\nseveral instances in automatic writing of misquotation used for\nemphasis, e.g. the substitution of \" hope \" for \" passion\n\"\nin the quotation from Aht Vogler (see Proc. S.P.E., Vol. XXII.,\np. 63).\nThere is evidence, therefore, in the script of September 6,\n1911, that the emergence of the quotation from Ariel's Song\n1\nCf. Sheridan, The Critic, in which the mad Tilburina has straw in her\nhair.\n\f270 Helen cle G. Verrall. [part\nwas the result of a persistent effort to give this quotation, and\nthis evidence is strengthened by the fact that there seems to\nbe an attempt to refer to the Song in the previous script on\nSeptember 2, 1911.\nThis script begins :\nLight only light the laughter of the sage where\u2014house of shades\nEver busy sprite\nCome here on tripping feet that scorn the grass\nWelcome ! from the sea\nIn her original copy of the script Miss Mac put a note to\n\" Ever busy sprite,\" saying that \" it suggests The Tempest\nand Ariel.\" The actual phrase does not occur in the play, but\nthe description is obviously appropriate to Ariel, and several\ntimes Prospero calls tipon Ariel to \" come,\" e.g. :\n\" Come\nwith a thought,\" \"Come away, servant,\" \"Ariel, come,\"\nand he habitually calls him \" spirit,\" \" my tricksy spirit,\"\netc. Moreover, the automatists' interpretation of the phrase\nas referring to Ariel is an important point, whether the inter-\npretation be thought correct or not, since it shows that the\nassociation was in their mind.\nThen again, at the end of the same script we find :\nwan from the waves I the mark that is missed\nlips kissed\nAriel's Song runs :\n\" Come unto these yellow sands\nAnd there take hands ;\nCurtsied when you have and kissed\nThe wild waves whist.\"\nThe introduction of the words \" waves \" and \" kissed,\"\ntaken in conjunction with the probable allusion to Ariel at\nthe beginning of this script, may be due to a confused attempt\nto quote from the Song, which definitely emerges at the end\nof the next script.\nIt may therefore be said, I think, that these two scripts\ncontain more than a casual allusion to Ariel's Song ;\nthey\ngive evidence of repeated attempts to allude to it, and as soon\nas the attempt has been successful, the script ends.\n\flxix.] A Further Study of the Mac Scripts. 271\nThis point is interesting, when we remember that a quota-\ntion from Ariel's Song occurs in the H. V. script of January\n25, 1911, the first in the series of four, with which this paper\ndeals. Thus :\nCloth of gold the king's purple\n'Twas a royal train put forth to sea\nBut the tale can be told by none but me.\nThe wild waves wist.\nTo sum up, then :\n(a) There are four H. V. scripts written between January\nand March, 1911, connected one with another by the repetition\nof various phrases and ideas and by the fact that the first of\nthese scripts contains a quotation from The White Ship, and\nthe last a quotation from The Triumph of Time, these two\nquotations being closely associated with each other in sub-\nsequent H. V. scripts.\nOf these four scripts the first on January 25, 1911, com-\nbines with the quotation from The White Ship a quotation\nfrom Ariel's Song in The Tempest, an allusion to a barred gate,\nand a quotation from the first chorus in Swinburne's Atalanta ;\nthe second on February 28, 1911, has a Greek quotation,\nwhich might be paraphrased as \" the triumph of time \"\n;\nthe fourth on March 14, 1911, has a four-line quotation from\nSwinburne's Triumph of Time, combined with a statement\nthat an attempt has been made to give this idea before.\n(&) There are five (and only five) scripts written by Mr. and\nMiss Mac from July 7 to September 6, 1911, inclusive.\nIn the first, on July 7, 1911, there is probably an attempt\nto quote one of the two lines from Swinburne's Atalanta\nin Calydon quoted in the H. V. script of January 25, 1911 ;\nin the second script, on July 8, 1911, there are two allusions\nto a gate, which is described as important, followed by a\nquotation from the same verse of The Triumph of Time, which\nis quoted in the H. V. script of March 14, 1911, and a state-\nment that a cross-correspondence is aimed at ; in the third\nscript, on July 9, 1911, there is another allusion to a gate,\nfollowed by a quotation from the second chorus of Atalanta in\nCalydon and an allusion to the first chorus ; the automatists\nare also enjoined to \" send all this to Mrs. Verrall \" ; in the\ns\n\f272 Helen de O. Verrall. [part\nfourth script, on September 2, 1911, there are two probable\nallusions to Ariel ; and in the fifth script, on September 6,\n1911, there is an allusion to a gate, followed at the end of the\nscript by a quotation from Ariel's Song :\n\" Come unto these yellow sands,\nAnd there take hands.\"\nOr, to put it in another way, in the H. V. script of January\n25, 1911, we find a quotation from The White Ship, a quotation\nfrom Ariel's Song, a reference to a gate, and a quotation from\nthe first chorus of Atalanta in Galydon ; in the Mac script of\nJuly 8, 1911. there is a reference to a gate combined with a\nquotation from The Triumph of Time, afterwards associated\nin the H. V. script with the quotation from The White Ship ;\nin the Mac script of July 9, 1911, there is a reference to a gate\ncombined with an allusion to the first chorus from Atalanta\nin Galydon ; in the Mac script of September 6, 1911, there is\na reference to a gate combined with a quotation from Ariel's\nSong.\n1 turn now to the consideration of some scripts written by\nMrs. Verrall during the same period. In June, 1911, she\nproduced three scripts closely related to one another, in which\nthere appear to be attempts to indicate Swinburne's initials.\nThese attempts were not recognised by Mrs. Verrall (and no\none else had examined her scripts) until, on July 12, 1911, she\nread the three Mac scripts of July, the statements in which\nled her to search her own scripts for cross-correspondences\non the subject of Swinburne.\nThe three scripts in question are as follows :\n{Mrs. V.'s script of June 27, 1911.)\n2 \"Eiy\/xa (ocrai'roj? kou TaAAa. ypatjie crv \u2014et jit] p.eru. ixt'i'ccreojs\n\u2014\n(tvv\nra^ei. ra p.kXXovro.

The rest of the script is rather obscure, but it clearly\nimplies that there is more to come, that some other person\nis to play a part, and that Mrs. Verrall is to write again next\nday.\nIn the second script, on June 28, 1911, we find the words :\nA.

Puns\nand assonances are a fairly common feature of Mrs. Verrall 's\nscript.\nThe script of June 29, 1911, was written, Mrs. Verrall notes,\nin consequence of an impulse which came to her, whilst she\nwas copying the script of the preceding evening, and it evidently\ncarries on the same train of thought, concluding as it does\nwith the words :\nA was once an apple pie\nNow you have it\u2014part was said last night.\nThe way in which the letter A is gradually approached is\ninteresting. The script opens with a reference to a swan.\nThen after a short digression the word \" swan \" recurs, followed\nby a quotation containing the word \" wan,\" followed again\nby four lines of verse each beginning with the word \" an,\"\ngiving the sequence swan, wan, an, A.\nThus we find in these three scripts definite allusions to the\nletters A and S and a possible allusion to the letter C. It\nshould also be noted that in the script of June 28, 1911, the\nemphasis laid on the letter L in the Avords, \" A. Lodge,\" may\nhave been suggested by Swinburne's first name, Algernon.\nThe script of June 29, 1911, presents several other points\nof interest in connexion with the H. V. scripts of the preceding\nFebruary and March, which Mrs. Verrall had not seen when\nshe wrote it.\nThe script opens with a quotation from Browning's The\nWorst of It, which may be compared with Swinburne's Triumph\nof Time. In both poems the speaker is a lover whose mistress\nhas proved unfaithful, though the point of view of the two lovers\nis widely different. In particular we may contrast the con-\ncluding lines of The Worst of It :\n'\n' I knew you once ; but in Paradise\nIf we meet, I will pass nor turn my face.\"\n\fLXix.] A Further Study of the Mac Scripts. 275\nwith the concluding lines of The Triumph, of Time :\n\" Shall I lose you living and vex you dead ?\nI never shall tell you on earth ; and in heaven\nIf I cry to you then, will you hear or know %\n\"\nPossibly the H. V. script is groping after an allusion to\nThe Worst of It on March 10, 1911, in the words :\nthe best and the worst\nGod be thanked the meanest of bis creatures\nboasts two soul sides 1\nthe worst and the best\nI cannot get it clear.\nThe explicit allusion to Browning makes this interpretation\nmore probable.\nMrs. Verrall's script of June 29, 1911, has a further point of\nconnexion with the H. V. script of January 25, 1011, which\nhas :\nAnd apple\u2014the apple of discord\n\u2014\nthe fruit of the tree\nfollowed almost at once by the quotation from Atalanta in\nCalydon :\nAnd in green underwood and cover\nBlossom by blossom the spring begins.\nCompare in Mrs. Verrall's script the lines :\nAn apple caused the fall of human kind\nAn apple made the maiden's feet run slow\nThe first of these latter lines refers to the fruit of the tree\nof knowledge and the second to Atalanta, who was beaten\nin the race because she stopped to pick up the golden apples\nwhich Milanion let fall.\nIt only remains to consider how far the contents of these\nscripts may be accounted for by the normal thoughts of the\nautomatists at the time or by any habitual tendencies observed\nin their automatic writing. To consider my own scripts\n1\nBrowning's Men and Women, Epilogue.\n\f276 Helen cle O. Verrall. [part\nfirst, there had been very few allusions to Swinburne in my\nscript before January, 1911,\u2014three certain allusions (all to\nThe Garden of Proserpine), and one doubtful allusion to The\nTriumph of Time, not to the verse quoted on March 14, 1911.\nI am fairly well acquainted with Swinburne's poems, having\nat one time or another read the greater part of what he has\nwritten. With a few poems, including The Triumph of Time,\nI am more familiar, but Swinburne is not a poet for whom I\nhave a special admiration, and I do not read his poems very\noften. So far as I know, there had been nothing to turn my\nthoughts towards them in the early months of 1911.\nThere are seven allusions to Swinburne in the Mac script\nbefore July, 1911. They all occur between May and July,\n1909, and are probably due, in part at any rate, to the fact\nthat Swinburne died in April, 1909, so that he might naturally\nhave been in the automatists' minds about that time. Mr.\nand Miss Mac are familiar with Swinburne's work, as might\nbe inferred from the number of more or less correct quotations\noccurring in the script. But the predominance of Swinburne\nin the scripts of July and September, 1911, is very marked,\nand quite unlike the brief, fragmentary allusions in 1909.\nAbout half the whole amount of script produced in 1911\n(and attributed to Henry Sidgwick) consists of quotations\nfrom Swinburne. I have already referred to the fact that\nimmediately before the July scripts were written, Miss Mac\nhad read the articles on Mrs. Willett's and Mrs. Holland's\nscript in Proc. S.P.R., Part LXIIL, and the allusion to lilies\nand bees in the script of July 7, 1911, can be directly traced\nto this source. The question will naturally be asked : can\nany other part of the scripts and especially the allusions to\nSwinburne be explained in the same way ? Both in the\narticle on Mrs. Willett's script and in the article on Mrs.\nHolland's script, passages from Swinburne are discussed at\nsome length.1\nPassages from several other poets are discussed\neven more fully ;\nbut, if the case for a supernormal connexion\nbetween the Mac scripts and mine depended solely, or even\nmainly, on our both alluding to Swinburne, it would be\nseriously weakened by Miss Mac having read Part LXIIL\nBut I hope that I have already made it clear that the case\n1\nSee Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXV. pp. 206 ff. and 234 ff.\n\flxix.] A Further Study of the Mac Scripts. 277\nrests on a much surer foundation, and some further considera-\ntions will make this point still clearer.\nThe poems by Swinburne which are discussed in Part LXIII.\nare The Garden of Proserpine, Itylus, and the third chorus\nfrom Atalanta in Galydon, which has an obvious association\nwith Itylus. It contains the lines :\n'\n' The brown bright nightingale amorous\nIs half assuaged for Itylus,\"\nAvhich are the lines referred to in Part LXIII.\nOn the other hand, none of these poems is mentioned in\nthe Mac script (the allusions to Atalanta are to the first and\nsecond choruses), and the only passage which is claimed in\nthe script as a cross-correspondence is one from The Triumph\nof Time. It is not unlikely, I think, that from reading Part\nLXIII. Miss Mac's mind received an initial impulse, which,\nby association of ideas, greatly facilitated the emergence of\ncertain latent impressions ; but this initial impulse can hardly\nbe considered sufficient to account for the particular course\nfollowed by the script. Why is it that, whereas the poems\ndiscussed in Part LXIII. are The Garden of Proserpine, Itylus,\nand the third chorus from Atalanta in Galydon, the emphasis\nin the script is thrown on to The Triumph of Time % More-\nover, the curious way in which the Mac scripts are linked\ntogether by references to a gate cannot be explained by any-\nthing in Part LXIII., whereas the probability of a super-\nnormal connexion with my script of January 25, 1911, which\nalso refers to a gate, is thereby increased.\nAlthough the scripts as a whole show remarkably little\nconnexion with the normal, contemporary thoughts of the\nautomatists, yet there are cases in which it is clear that a\nnormal train of thought has formed the starting-point of a\nscript. It is almost inevitable that this should be so, seeing\nthat the mind of an automatist during the production of\nscript is not divided by any hard and fast line from the same\nmind at other times. I should not think it worth while to\ndwell on this point, if it were not that some critics seem to\nthink that if they can trace the influence of any normal associa-\ntion of ideas either in the connexion of the scripts Avith the\nnormal thoughts of the automatist, or in the connexion of one\n\f278 Helen de G. Verrall. [part\npart of a script with another, they have thereby removed\nany ground we might have for supposing that the scripts\nhave been influenced by some force external to the mind of\nthe automatist. That is a confused and misleading way of\nstating the problem. The relation between the scripts and\nthe normal thoughts and knowledge of the automatists is, of\ncourse, an important question, but the crucial point to be\ndetermined is this : how definite are the connexions between\nthe scripts of one automatist and those of another, and how\nprobable is it that these connexions are due to chance-coinci-\ndence ? That may be a very difficult question to determine,\nand, as Mrs. Sidgwick has pointed out, in her reply to Dr.\nMaxwell, it is one upon which individual judgments will differ.\nNevertheless, in the answer to this question lies the solution\nof the problem.\nBut admitting, as most students of psychical research do,\nthat there is evidence in these automatic writings for the\ninfluence of some supernormal agency, it becomes a matter of\npsychological interest to trace the workings of an automatist's\nmind, as it is reflected in the scripts. It is especially interesting,\nI think, to notice the part played by the ordinary laws of\nassociation, as in the case of the Mac scripts of September 2\nand 6, 1911, where a certain goal is reached in a way suggest-\ning that it has been deliberately sought, because, assuming\nthat some telepathic force has been at work on the automatist's\nmind\u2014whether it is telepathy from the living or the dead\nmatters nothing to the present argument\u2014it seems a priori\nprobable that the effect of this telepathic force will be not to\nthrust a human mind entirely out of its natural channels,\nbut to turn the stream of ideas a little this way or that, and\nthus to exercise a choice as to which amongst a hundred\npossible associations shall actually emerge.\n\flxix.j Experiments in Thought-Transference. 279\nV.\nEXPERIMENTS IN THOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE.\nBy Clarissa Miles and Hermione Ramsden.\n[Most of the experiments recorded in this paper have already\nbeen reported in the Journal, see Vol. XIII., pp. 243-262,\nand Vol. XIV., pp. 392-399.

I have been down there three or four times before\nfor painting lessons and have always stayed at Laburnum\nVilla, which belongs to Mr. and Mrs. Henry Lovegrove.\nThis autumn for the first time here, I began to try thought-\ntransference with Miss Ramsden.\nThis is Mr. Pittman's description of what happened on\nNovember 2nd, 1907 :\nHoe Benham, Newbury.\nOn November 2nd, 1907, I was painting in the Studio with my\nfriend Reginald Waud ; the model was our servant dressed as a\nwidow, and we were waiting for Miss Miles to join us.

I went down to the Studio and said to Waud, \" What\ndo you think Miss Miles is bringing down with her this morning,\ninstead of her Chow ? A large pig !\n\" We roared with laughter,\nand he said, \" Call out and tell her not to bring her friend in, and\nto be sure to shut the gate, as we take a great pride in our\ngarden.\" The moment Miss Miles appeared I opened the window\nand shouted out, \" What have you done with your companion ?\n\"\nShe was very surprised and said, \" My companion, what do you\nmean ?\n\" Then I told her what I had seen following her. She\nimmediately said, \" If a pig were trotting behind me, I must have\nheard it. Besides, there is a very easy way of finding out, for I\npassed the milkman in the lane and he must have seen it, but\nI shall go and look for myself.\" When she came back she said :\n\" There is no trace of a pig anywhere.\" We made enquiries all\nover the village ; no one had seen a stray pig. There is only one\nwhite one in the place, and this one, its owner assured us, could\nnot possibly have got loose without his knowing it. At the present\ntime there is a notice out forbidding owners to allow pigs to stray,\nunder penalty of a fine, as there have been cases of swine fever.\nWe enquired of the milkman next morning.

I also\nwished to get further evidence of the strange animal forms\nthat are supposed to haunt this lane, as I was told last\nNovember, after the episode of the phantom pig, that so\nmany of the villagers had been witnesses of these remarkable\napparitions under different forms, such as a cat, a dog, or a\nrabbit, or other animals. Mr. Pittman and Mr. Waud had\nnever seen anything weird or out of the ordinary till I came\ndown last autumn and began thought-transference with Miss\nRamsden ;\nthey had only heard quite casually very vague\naccounts of something strange that had been seen years ago,\nto which they had paid but little attention. The villagers\nare very reticent and will not talk much for fear of being\nlaughed at, but the history of the phantom pig overcame all\ndifficulties on that score as regards my enquiries.\n\f290 Clarissa Miles. [part\nThe villagers all tell the same story to account for these\napparitions. They put them all down to \" Tommy King.\"\nHe was a farmer, who lived over a hundred years ago. He\nhung himself in an outhouse, and his spirit is supposed to\nhaunt the spot, appearing in these strange shapes and making\nuncanny noises. The farm buildings and outhouses were all\ndemolished on the occasion of the sale of the property by\nMr. Dreweatt to Sir Richard Sutton in 1 892 ;\nonly a cottage\nremains, which is still called King's cottage, and a disused\nwell close to the lane, which is called Tommy King's chalk\nwell. In former years they used to dig out chalk from the\nside of the hill. I have looked at the Register of the Parish\nChurch and there are entries of the deaths of two Tommy\nKings, one in 1741, the other in 1753, so it must be one of\nthese two.\nAt the corner of the lane stands an old-fashioned inn,\ncalled the Halfway, because it is halfway between London\nand Bristol and sixty miles from each. It is on the main\nroad, and in the olden days all the coaches stopped here\nto change horses. The lane to Hoe Benham branches off\nhere, going up a hill called Pound Hill. King's cottage and\nthe well are situated to the left of the lane. The well is close\nto the road, but only a hole in the bank indicates the spot.\nAt the top of the hill about ten minutes' walk brings you\nto the Church, then there is a short, sharp decline and the\nstraggling village of Hoe Benham is reached. After Benham\nHill is mounted a cluster of cottages is seen nestling on the\nside of the hill, one of them belonging to Mr. Pittman and\nMr. Waud. Their cottage is about a mile from the Half-\nway, and it is all along this lane that the apparitions have\nbeen seen.\nThe following are accounts which I obtained from some of\nthe villagers. I Avrote down what they told me as nearly\nas possible in their own words, and afterwards got their\nsignatures to the accounts.\nHoe Benham.\nIn the beginning of January, 1905, about half-past seven in the\nevening, I was walking up from the Halfway.

This creature had two glowing eyes, which appeared\nto me to be almost as big as saucers. I looked at it in astonish-\nment for a minute or so, when it suddenly vanished.

She kept a baker's\nshop, and I had to lay the leaven for the bread every evening.\nSundays Mrs. Flower always had supper with her mother at\nWickham Heath. For this she had to go up Benham Hill. One\nevening she returned as white as a ghost and lay on the sofa as if\nshe were going to die. She said, \"I be all of a shake and a\ntremble. I did see summat white on the gate at the hill. Never\nshall I go to supper agen with my mother of an evening.\" And\nshe never did. I replied, \" I never seen nothing there on that\nhill ; I have been up and down all hours of the night.\" I\nremember the elate, it must have been on a summer's evening\nabout 35 years ago. [Polly Barrett chimed in and said, \" Quite\nright, you were a courtin' and you told me.\"] A few days after,\nbetween nine and ten in the evening, I was a-comin' down Benham\nHill. Between the two gates, I heard a rattle on the stones as of\nan animal pawing the ground. I looked to see what it was. I\nsaw summat like a sheep. I went to'poke un with my stick when\nit vanished away.\nAnother time me and my brother George were walking late near\nPerris Cottage. We heard summat that made such a rumpus like\nstones tipped down from a cart. We groped about and walked to\nand agen to and agen, and waited to hear summat more, but could\nnot make out nothing, so we just walked home.

All the morning I felt in a weird, trance-like state, the\ncondition I get into when I have visions of coming events, changes\nlikely to affect my future. I described these sensations both to\nMr. Pittman and to Mr. Waud. After Church I felt compelled\nto walk towards Tommy King's chalk well, as I wished to see the\nroad along which the team of horses came, which were so terrified\nat the white thing bobbing ujd and down over their heads. We\nthought we would go and have tea with Mr. and Mrs. Le Mesurier,\nwho live at the end of the lane just opposite Halfway Inn. To\nreach them from Hoe Benham we always take a short cut across\nthe fields. I looked over the old inn, and the proprietor showed\nme where the old stables stood, where the bell was always rung to\nget the horses ready for changing teams. I take a great interest\nin all coaching matters and horses, for I have hunted all my life,\nand my father was a splendid whip, also one of the finest heavy\nweights of his day across country. After tea, Mr. Waud and I\nwalked back. On passing Tommy King's well an overpowering\nsense of suffocation seized me, I felt the presence of some awful\nbeing. This evil spirit seemed to follow me up Pound Hill. I\nfelt it longing to do me some bodily injury, there was such deadly\nmalice and hate in the air. I described all this to Mr. Waud.\nWe constantly looked around but could see nothing. These\nsensations continued all the way back, but grew worse as we\nwalked up Benham Hill. After the cottage was passed a shiver\nwent down my back and spine, the same kind of shock I ex-\nperience when dowsing and walking over water. Suddenly quite\nclose to us on the road the stillness of the evening was broken\nby an unearthly scream which seemed to end in a moan. As the\nsound seemed so very close to us, we both looked round to see\nif anything was near which would have produced it, but nothing\nwhatever was visible. We both were speechless for a minute,\n\u2014\nthe effect was so awful. We hardly spoke till we reached\nLaburnum Villa, the time being about six o'clock. It was\nonly the next day, in comparing notes, that we found this dread-\nful wailing cry was heard on the exact spot where the phantom\npig was seen by Mr. Pittman following me on November 2nd,\n1907.\n\f300 Clarissa Miles. [part\nTwo evenings after, on February 18th, I walked to Tommy\nKing's chalk well with Mr. Pittman to try if any more strange\nphenomena could be seen. It was a brilliant moonlight night.\nNo evil beings were there to disturb the stillness of this evening,\nall was calm and peaceful. I tried automatic writing, and two\nsentences were written twice over ;\nthey came with such lightning\nspeed, no human hand could have written that pace alone. The\nwords were, \" I am in hell, pray for me, I am in hell, pray for me \"\n;\nnothing more. On walking back we looked around and across\nthe lane a white band of light appeared ; \u2014the same sparkling-\neffect I have sometimes seen at sea, from the deck of a yacht on\na dark night, shimmering on the ocean. It was of a quite different\nquality from the moonlight. This luminous effect undulated\nup and down, backwards and forwards, and seemed to come towards\nus, till it appeared to be only five yards away ; it was about a foot\nfrom the ground ; it then receded and disappeared. We both\nsaw it ; most strange and mysterious it appeared in the brilliant\nmoonlight. Another evening a little later I walked down with\nMr. Pittman but nothing of special interest occurred. But the\npencil wrote automatically, \" I am happier.\"\nOn Benham Hill where so many strange apparitions have been\nseen, one evening when it was half daylight, half dark, I distinctly\nsaw a white shadowy form which appeared like drapery standing\nagainst the gate. No one else saw this.\nOn Thursday, February 27th, my last evening at Hoe Benham,\nI dined at the cottage, and Mr. Pittman and Mr Waud walked\nback with me. We were laughing and talking. Suddenly our\nconversation was interrupted by this unearthly moaning cr3r\n,\nwhich came wailing across the stillness of the evening. This\ndoleful sound seemed to come over our heads from the roof of the\nChapel which is exactly opposite Laburnum Villa. We all heard it .\nIt was a repetition of the groan Mr. Waud and I heard the other\nevening preceded by that awful scream.\n(Signed) Clarissa Miles.\nReginald Waud.\nOsmund Pittman.\nMr. Waud adds :\nOn Monday, February 24th, whilst Pittman and I were taking\ntea in the cottage, two distinct taps were heard on the door just\n\flxix.] Experiments in Thought-Transference. 301\nbehind us.

My sole object is to show that, while it is easy\nand not unnatural to imagine the phenomena to be some-\nhow explicable by telepathy between embodied minds, it is\nby no means so easy to work out in detail a coherent theory\nwhich would lend reasonable support to the supposition.\nI take first the second alternative, which can be briefly\ndismissed. It offers two choices : Mrs. Willett's subconscious\nself, as the active and planning intelligence, may have drawn\nits supernormally acquired knowledge either from (a) a dis-\nembodied spirit, or (b) from memories stored in the spirit\nworld independently of any surviving personality. The\nformer supposition (a), which postulates the survival of\nhuman personality, need not be discussed at length. It pre-\nsents practically the same difficulties as we shall find con-\nfronting us when we come to examine alternative (1). If,\nas will appear, it is unlikely that one incarnate mind can\nextract information from another without that other's con-\ncurrence and assistance,\u2014can in fact read the other mind as\none reads a book,\u2014there is no reason to suppose that it would\nfare better in an endeavour to read the thoughts of a dis-\ncarnate spirit. At any rate, the argument from analogy is\nall we have to go upon at present, and the point can well\nbe deferred until the fact of communication between the\nliving and the dead is so firmly established that the question,\nwhich of the two is the active factor, is the only one at issue.\nWith regard to the second supposition (b), so far as I am\naware, the notion of a \" spiritual reservoir of pooled memories,\"\nthough originated by one of the most brilliant of psychologists,\nis a mere imagination unsupported by any substantial evidence.\nBefore leaving it, however, we may note that the evolving of\nthis strange and really fantastic suggestion shows of itself\nhow little satisfied William James was that telepathy between\n1\nThe scripts will be found on pp. 222 ff . supra.\nX\n\f320 Rev. M. A. Bayfield. [part\nthe living would explain even the phenomena which had come\nto light in his day.\nLet us consider the alternatives numbered (1) and (3).\nWhat are the assumptions involved in (1)\u2014that \" the\nreally active and planning intelligence may have been Mrs.\nWillett's subconscious self, drawing its material from some\nother embodied consciousness \" % I imagine them some-\nwhat as follows. During the fortnight or so immediately\npreceding the production of the first script Mrs. Willett's\nthoughts had been, as we know, specially attracted to Dr.\nVerrall by the news of his death, which occurred on June 18,\n1912. Stimulated by her conscious thoughts, her subliminal,\nwe conjecture, enters upon a series of activities which, though\nin effect productive of an imposture, may not have been\nfraudulent in intention. Possibly the fraud was deliberate,\nas I incline to think it was in the case of M. Til quoted in\nProceedings, Vol. XXV., p. 470 ; but in Mrs. Willett's case,\nbeing free to assume what I please, I prefer another sup-\nposition. We will suppose that her subliminal (hence-\nforth for convenience referred to as '\nZ.') dreams that\nVerrall's spirit wishes to make a communication through\nher, and as happens in dreams, comes to identify itself, the\ndreamer, with him. Thus the dreamed wish has now become\nZ.'s own wish, and the train is laid for a pseudo-communica-\ntion.\nThe next step is to find suitable material. Apparently\nMrs. Willett did not herself possess any, for we have her\nown word for it that she had no conscious knowledge what-\never of that which was actually used\u2014Verrall's essay entitled\nThe Baptism of Statins. The subject-matter of the purposed\ncommunication must therefore be borrowed from the mind\nof some other living person, probably (according to our\npresent knowledge) that of one of the small number of \" sensi-\ntives \" with whom she was in touch. Since, however, only\ntwo of these, Mrs. Verrall and Miss Verrall, had read the\nessay in question, it must have been in the mind of one of\nthese two ladies that Z. found the thing it wanted.\nBut Jioiv did Z. find it ? Shall we say, by rummaging,\nwithout invitation given or leave asked, among the millions\nand millions of memories stored in that mind (whose sub-\n\fLXIX.] To Clear the Air. 321\nliminal consciousness we will, for convenience of reference,\ndesignate '\nV.'), and selecting unaided the one that appeared\nlikely to suit ? And if we say this, have we at present any\nwarrant for believing that a subliminal has the power thus to\nransack another mind and abstract its latent thoughts, that\nother lending no assistance, but remaining passive and inert ?\nOur published records of experimental telepathy show that\nwhen a thought has passed from one mind to another, the\nformer has always intended to effect the particular transfer-\nence, or, as in some of the experiments conducted by Miss\nRamsden and Miss Miles, has had the imparted thought\nconsciously present to it at or about the time when the transfer\nwas effected. This fact has not unnaturally led us to assume\nthat in all cases of telepathy the person whose thought is\ntransferred is the active factor in the actual process of trans-\nference, and for reasons given below I believe we are right.\nOn the other hand, it must be admitted that in spontaneous\ntelepathy there is no conscious intention to convey the par-\nticular impression which the percipient receives. Spontaneous\ncases, therefore, and indeed the majority of experimental\ncases, if they are regarded alone and other considerations\nare neglected, might seem to offer no obstacle to the con-\ntrary supposition,\u2014that in ordinary telepathy, certain neces-\nsary conditions being favourable, the actively operating\nintelligence may be that of the percipient.\nThe question is further complicated by the fact that we do\nnot know whether in telepathy between the living it is only\nthe subliminal consciousnesses that come into touch with each\nother, or whether the essential immaterial intelligences of the\ntwo who are concerned somehow meet. In a case of com-\nmunication from the spirit world I incline to take the latter\nview ; and I should suppose that there is a more intimate\nfusion of mind with mind than could be effected by anything\nthat could be called conversation :\n\u2014\nAnd all at once it seem'd at last\nHis living soul was flash 'd on mine.\nAnd mine with his was wound, and whirl'd\nAbout empyreal heights of thought,\nAnd came on that which is. . . .\n\f322 Rev. M. A. Bayfield. [PAET\nEven so, there must, I should imagine, be a willingness on\nboth sides and co-operation. But whatever may be the\nmethod by which a spirit communicates its thoughts to an\nembodied mind, the existing evidence, in my judgement,\npoints to the conclusion that telepathy between the living\ndoes not need for its accomplishment more than the activity\nof the subliminal consciousness, and upon that basis this\npaper is written.\nTo return to the point which immediately concerns us\n\u2014\nwhich of the two persons concerned is the active factor in\nordinary telepathy\u2014notwithstanding the admission made\nabove, all the probabilities seem to me to point away from\nthe supposition that thoughts could be literally stolen. I\nbase this conclusion on several concurrent considerations.\nFirstly, on the broad ground that, thought being essentially\nan activity, one would expect it to pass to another mind\nby its own energy ; it seems unnatural to suppose that it\ncould be read like an inanimate piece of print. Secondly,\nin cases of spontaneous telepathy such as those in which\nan apparition of the dying is seen, and especially when the\nhallucination is experienced by more than one person, it\nseems perverse to seek the prime cause elsewhere than in\nthe activity of the dying person's mind. And if this is so,\nanalogy suggests that in other cases also of spontaneous\ntelepathy,\u2014as, for instance, when Mrs. Holland's script made\nreference to some furs recently purchased by Miss Verrall,\nthe ostensible agent (here Mrs. Verrall or Miss Verrall) is\nreally the active factor in the transference. Thirdly, while\nall experimental telepathy obviously suggests this view of\nits own modus operandi, I do not see how we can resist the\nevidence afforded by one class of experiments in particular ;\nI mean those in which pain is suppressed or prevented by\nsuggestion without the induction of trance. (Whether there\nis or is not in such cases some slight degree of hypnosis, is\nhere immaterial.) In a valuable paper on experiments of\nthis kind, published in Proceedings, Vol. XII., pp. 21 ff., Mr.\nC. M. Barrows writes (p. 25), \" Mine is a silent suggestion.\nI use neither voice nor other means to convey its import to\nthe patient through sensory adits. I find it possible to affect\nwith these unvoiced suggestions one who does not know my\n\fLXIX.] To Clear the Air. 323\nlanguage, infants who have learned no language, and brute\ncreatures. . . . More than this : I am not conscious of\nforming any statement of the message, even in thought, when\nI make the suggestion.\" Surely there is no room for doubting\nthat Mr. Barrows' mind was the active factor in the numerous\nsuccessful experiments which he made,\u2014that there was no\nreading of his thoughts by the patient. If doubt were possible\nin some instances, the mention of infants, at any rate, is con-\nclusive. I may add that the last quoted sentence has some\nbearing on what I have said a few lines above about the prob-\nable activity of the subliminal in cases of spontaneous tele-\npathy. In any case, it is sufficient for my present argument\nto point out that the supposition that Z. might be able to\nread V.'s thoughts unassisted, rests at present upon no\nfoundation, while the contrary view has much to be said\nfor it.\nWe fare no better with the alternative supposition, that\nZ. does not play the thief, but is assisted by the co-operation\nof V., who obediently selects and gives over the thing de-\nmanded. This would seem to entail a little conversation\nbetween the two. If the commodity which is to change hands\ncannot be stolen, it must be asked for. But if Z. can '\nspeak\n'\nand V. can '\nhear,' we must in fairness attribute the power\nof speech to V. and that of hearing to Z. ; and that in that\ncase V. would ask some questions, we cannot doubt.\nWe ask ourselves at once, can subliminals converse ? \"It\nmayn't be much to do, your Majesty, but can they do it ?\n\"\nThe subliminal is certainly \" a very good bowler,\" and may\nbe counted on to get one '\nwood '\nin even at long bowls ;\n\" but for Alisander\u2014alas, you see how 'tis,\"\u2014at present we\nhave no evidence of its ability to take part in dialogue. Never-\ntheless, for the sake of argument, let us assume that it possesses\nthis indispensable faculty. We have next to ask, in what\ncharacter does Z. open the negotiations ? As the spirit it\nnow believes itself to be, and expecting to be accepted as\nsuch by V. ? Then, I suppose, something like this would\nbe said : \"I want to bring off an evidential communication\nthrough Mrs. Willett, but can think of nothing to say. Do\nsuggest something.\" The incredible confession would, I fancy,\ncondemn our masquerading Z. out of its own mouth. The\n\f324 Rev. M. A. Bayfield. [PART\nfirst thought of V. would be (with a twist of Hamlet's meaning),\nThou comest in such a questionable shape,\nand there would be, alas, no answer !\nShall we say, then, that, by a shifting of the dream-centre,\nZ. has for the moment recovered its identity and speaks in\npropria persona, and that the colloquy proceeds thus : \"I\nwant a little material to make up into a pseudo-spirit-com-\nmunication. Could you let me have something that would\ndo ?\n\"\u2014\" Certainly ; what do you think of this ?\n\" Or\ninstead of a ready acquiescence, did the tempted subliminal\nshow reluctance and need persuasion, and when persuaded\nstill perhaps express a natural misgiving as to success ?\nMacbeth. But if we fail ?\nLady Macbeth. We fail\n!\nBut screw your courage to the sticking point,\nAnd we'll not fail.\nHowever the interview may have proceeded, neither is self-\ndeceived ; the two are engaged in planning a most nefarious\nconspiracy, and both of them know it. I will not deny that\neven these two subliminals might be morally capable of such\nan imposture, for I do not forget the shifts and evasions of\nMrs. Newnham's, but it will be time enough to go into that\nwhen we have proof that subliminals are able to exchange\ntheir thoughts in conversation at all. Until the proof is\nforthcoming the assumption of collusion seems hardly more\nattractive than that of robbery, and we may hesitate to\nchoose between them. However, let us not be daunted.\nIf choice is difficult, let us refuse to choose, but assume that\nsomehow or other Z. could get from V. the thing it requires.\nWe have now to ask, what it is that Z. gets. Clearly one\nof two things : either (a) the sum and substance of the essay,\nor (6) the ready-made confection that had perhaps only been\nwaiting, by the happiest of coincidences, for some one to\ntake and make use of it\u2014the actual riddle, framed upon\nthe essay, which is propounded in the script. 1\nOur bold leap has brought us to the very heart of the\n1 See p. 222 supra.\n\fLXIX.] To Clear the Air. 325\nmatter ; let us consider the probabilities severally attaching\nto these two alternatives.\nIf (a), the whole essay, was the treasure trove, how did\nZ. apprehend it ? As a complete whole,\u2014at one gulp, as\nit were, after the manner of a serpent swallowing an egg ?\nBefore attempting to answer the question we must first ask\nwhether it is probable that the essay subsists in V. as an\nagglomerated, individualized whole, if I may so put it. Let\nus suppose that in the mind itself, the centre of our intelli-\ngence, the whole essay may so subsist as an extremely elaborate\ncomplex concept ; then another mind might, we may equally\nsuppose, apprehend such a whole by one comprehensive act.\nI do not know how far the first of these suppositions rests\non any psychological probability, but the two taken together\nare useless for our present purpose, unless we identify the\nsubliminal consciousness with the mind itself. But as I\nunderstand our terminology and the psychological view which\nit implies, the mind is one thing and the mind's consciousness\n(subliminal or supraliminal), although inseparable from it,\nis another ; and upon our present evidence at any rate, as\nI have already said, we are not warranted in believing that\nin a case of ordinary telepathy either of the two persons con-\ncerned brings into direct and immediate operation any more\nintimate part of his personality than the subliminal con-\nsciousness. We must therefore dismiss these suppositions,\nand seek further for an answer.\nWhat is one's experience in ordinary acts of recollection ?\nIt is true that when I myself think of the essay, I seem in a\nway to recall it as a whole, but do I really ? Do I not rather\nrecollect first one of the ideas of which it is composed, and\nthen successively, though with great rapidity, a certain number\nof others, one idea following on another by some mysterious\nassociation 1 Consciousness, whether supraliminal or sub-\nliminal, appears to be no more than a manifestation of the\nmind's activity ; and the brain\u2014the instrument both of\nconscious and subliminal thought, as hypnotic experiments\nshow\u2014would appear to be so constituted that it can only\nallow ideas to issue in a series of flashes, so to speak. At\nany rate one thing is certain,\u2014in whatever form the essay\nsubsists in my mind itself, the ideas of which it is composed\n\f326 Rev. M. A. Bayfield. [part\nare never all present to my external consciousness at one\nand the same moment. And if ever I recall the sum and\nsubstance of the essay as a whole and by one act, am I\nnot in reality recalling a new and complex concept formed\nin my mind upon reading the essay,\u2014a complex peculiarly\nmy own and differing from another man's, and one which,\nso far from being identical with the essay, lacks most of its\ndetails ? I conclude, therefore, since the essay never emerges\nas a complete whole, nor any considerable part of it as written,\nthat it is not present as a whole in the subliminal conscious-\nness, and that accordingly Z. could not apprehend it from\nV. in this form.\nLet us proceed on another tack, and consider in what form\nwe can with greatest probability suppose the memories of\nthe essay to be immanent in the mind itself of whose activity\nthe subliminal consciousness V. is merely the expression.\nAnd since the argument will not be affected thereby, we will\nfor the moment grant Z. liberty of access even to this very\ncentre of intelligence.\nAs I am informed, if I understand my informant aright,\nthe best supported view among psychologists is that memories\nare retained as a series of mutually interpenetrating concepts.\nThus the memories of an essay would subsist in the mind as a\nivhole and not a. whole. The whole essay is there (assuming\nall its concepts to be retained), but not as an isolated body\nof memories ; for the recovery of it as a logical whole there\nmust be made a selective combination of all the concepts\nthat belong to it, with rejection of all others. If this is so,\nit seems natural and reasonable to suppose that it is as a series\nof concepts that Z. apprehends the essay, whether by\n\" reading \" or by V.'s recital. What exactly is the manner\nof this interpenetration of concepts, no one, I imagine, could\nsay ;\nnor, accordingly, why when one of a given series emerges\nto my external consciousness others of the series have a tendency\nto emerge also, while some do not. Again one thing is cer-\ntain,\u2014I cannot evoke them all at will ; I trace the associa-\ntions successfully up to a point, and then break down. Is\nit, then, likely that Z., starting from one concept and\nunassisted by V., could trace out the whole series of\nwhich the essay is composed ? (If we assume conversa-\n\fLXIX.] To Clear the Air. 327\ntiort between the two, we come in effect to Mr. Balfour's\nthird alternative, which is examined below.) We shall be\nlittle helped if we show ourselves yet more generous to Z.,\nand having endowed it with the power to apprehend at will\nsome of the concepts in another mind, assign to it also the\npower of apprehending the mode of interpenetration by which\nconcepts are connected. Our mental concepts have each of\nthem several, and most of them countless associations ; how\nthen could Z., ignorant as it is of the goal to be reached, know\nwhich line of association to take ? For what is its position ?\nWe may for our present purpose compare any given series\nof concepts (the essay) to a water-way, which is made up of\na number of interpenetrating particles of water ; and the\nmind to a sort of water-maze, of practically limitless extent\nand containing many millions of such water-ways, which\ncontinually intersect each other. Z., then, is in the position\nof a man who, exploring this maze, wishes to follow the route\npreviously traversed by a friend, though he knows neither\nat what point his friend started nor what point he made his\ndestination. It would be as much bewildered as our little\nfriend who asked, \" Which way am I to go now, please ?\n\"\n\" Where do you want to go to ? \" replied the Caterpillar.\n\" I don't know,\" said Alice. \" Then it doesn't matter which\nway you go.\" We seem, in fact, to have set this subliminal\na task \" imagination boggles at.\"\nFreely granting that, if Z. can grasp the whole essay, such\na clever subliminal will have no difficulty in framing a little\nenigma in connexion with it, we will leave it to its task and\ngo back to our second alternative (b) : \u2014Z. finds in V., ready-\nmade and admirably suited to its purpose, the puzzle pro-\npounded in Script (A). 1\nStill we are baffled, for all the diffi-\nculties which we have been examining continue to confront\nus, though on a smaller scale,\u2014that is to say, in connexion\nwith a more limited subject-matter. For although the riddle\nis of much smaller bulk than the essay, it must equally be\napprehended as a whole or by some process of rehabilitation.\nWe have already discussed the difficulties attaching to\neach alternative ; but the form in which the puzzle appears\nin the script presents yet another. If Z. could obtain from\n1\nSee p. 222 supra.\n\f328 Rev. M. A. Bayfield. [part\nV. a knowledge of the gist of the essay at all, it might, we\nmay perhaps say, have obtained this in a more or less rough\nform ;\nhere, however, we have a little picture in words, an\nepisode in a story, neatly and compactly rounded off, and\ncomplete so far as it goes. It occupies four lines of print,\nand unites in logical connexion a considerable number of\nconcepts. I cannot recall from our records of cross-corre-\nspondences any case in which it could be maintained that\none living mind has received from another a similar com-\nposition. The transference of single concepts, simple or\ncomplex, would appear to be the limit of an incarnate mind's\ntelepathic achievement. Many automatic scripts, it is true,\ncontain connected writings of considerable extent, but we do\nnot find them reproduced in the script of other automatists.\nEven in the case of Mrs. Piper (who may be regarded as a\n\" sensitive \" of at least equal capacity with Mrs. Willett,\nwhether as giver or receiver of impressions) single ideas\n\u2014\nwords or phrases\u2014are the utmost that we find appearing\nboth in her script and in the script of others in identical form.\nMoreover, if one incarnate mind has this power of reading the\nthoughts of another as connected in that other mind, why, we\nmay fairly ask, did not Mrs. Piper read and reproduce the\ntranslation of the Latin Message, which was vividly present\nto the minds of several persons, both sitters and others, during\na considerable period of time ? Her desire and her efforts to\ndo so must have been far stronger than Z.'s in the present case.\nIt has been suggested to me that a performance of the\nmedium Adele Maginot (see Proceedings, Vol. XIV., pp. 61 ff.)\nshould in fairness be mentioned here, as possibly an instance\nto the contrary of what has just been said. The sitter, M.\ndu Potet, wished her to '\ncall up '\nM. Dubois, a friend of his\nwho had died some fifteen months before. She proceeded\nto give an extraordinarily detailed and (save for four mistakes)\naccurate description of this friend's outward appearance, mode\nof carriage, walk, and gestures. If we regard this as a case\nof spontaneous telepathy, which it appears to be, we have\nclearly something very different from the transference of the\nlogically connected composition of Script (A). I see no diffi-\nculty in supposing that the medium received successively\nfrom the sitter's mind, as he sat in front of her, a number\n\fLXIX.] To Clear the Air. 329\nof separate concepts (say, twenty-one), or possibly one complex\nconcept picturing the whole man. Two points which would\nnot properly belong to such a pictorial concept in M. du Potet's\nmind were mentioned by the medium, but they were wrong.\nM. Dubois' action in the vision on hearing mention of the\nJesuits, is obviously a complex concept of this kind.\nIf this analysis of Mr. Balfour's first alternative is sound,\nthat alternative seems to involve for Script (A) the combi-\nnation of a number of assumptions which are unsupported\nby our present knowledge and also in themselves improbable.\nIt is obvious that the same difficulties attach to the neatly\ncompacted problem contained in (C), 1\nif we suppose that Z.\nwas the active party in effecting its transference, in what-\never manner or form, from another mind. Neither this\nscript, therefore, nor either of the other two, since all three\nare intimately connected with one another and with (A),\ncalls for separate discussion.\nI must, however, advert briefly to one further difficulty\nwhich is presented by all the scripts when they are considered\nas produced by the method of this first alternative. Z. offers\nfor our inspection four bricks\u2014if a metaphor may be per-\nmitted\u2014composed of a peculiar kind of clay, a species which\nwe recognise as Verrallian. We find it difficult to understand\nhow Z. could have obtained the clay ; but on examination\nof the bricks our perplexity increases, for we find that the\nclay is bound together by a peculiar kind of straw, a kind\nwhich grows only in a certain district which we are sure was\nnever visited by Mrs. Willett. The straw is the life-like\ncharacterisation of Verrall discussed in my Note. The diffi-\nculties which, as we have seen, would attend Z.'s search after\nthe matter of the scripts must no less effectually defeat any\nefforts it might make to discover and reproduce these examples\nof VerraU's manner.\nLet us turn to Mr. Balfour's third and, as most people\nwill probably think, more attractive alternative :\n\" the really\nactive and planning intelligence may have been the mind\nof some other living person acting on the mind of the auto-\nmatist.\"\nFor the sake of argument, we will say that the intelligence\n1\nSee p. 223 supra.\n\f330 Rev. M. A. Bayfield. [part\nactively operating on Mrs. Willett's mind was that of Mrs.\nVerrall, though it should be noted in passing that, as a matter\nof fact, Mrs. Verrall was no more able than any one else to\nguess the enigma of Script (A) until the clue, \" Dante makes\nit clear,\" was given fourteen months later in Script (D). If\nher subliminal had composed the problem, one would have\nthought it likely that the key to it would emerge at some\ntime during this long interval.\nNot long before his death (June 18, 1912), Dr. Verrall\ndiscussed with Mrs. Verrall and two friends the selection of\ncertain of his essays for republication, and came to a decision\nas to which should be selected. The three essays on Dante\nwere from the first included in the list, but the copy for the\ntwo volumes was not sent to the press until the following\nSeptember. Now, while it is improbable that Mrs. Verrall\nconsciously recalled the point in the Baptism of Statins which\nreappears in the script, either at the time of the selection\nof the essays or in the interval which elapsed before July\n6, 1912, no doubt her subliminal may have done so. Let us\nsuppose that it did ; and let us further suppose that during\nthe fortnight preceding July 6, and in some such way as that\nsuggested above for Z., it conceived the idea of a pseudo-\nspirit-communication, and proceeded to concoct the little\npuzzle propounded in Script (A). Then, unless V. has some\npower of selecting a recipient, Script (A) is launched into the\nvoid, like a wireless message, to be taken in by any other\nsubliminal that happens to be receptive at the moment, and\nis in fact received and recorded by Mrs. Willett. Indeed,\nwe must suppose all four scripts (including the curious cir-\ncumstance of the laughter, which perhaps betrays V.'s delight\nat the success of its enterprise !) to be so given out and received\nverbatim et literatim.\nBut whether the subliminal can or can not select a recipient,\nour telegraphic simile (and some such seems to be required)\nhas carried us beyond the evidence. As an explanation of\nimpressions received of persons in articulo mortis or in some\nother critical situation, it seems to be reasonable to suppose\nthat such persons may have flashed forth an image of them-\nselves\u2014or, when the impression is auditory, a word or phrase\n\u2014-somewhat wireless message is given out. In such\n\fLXIX.] To Clear the Air. 331\ncases, however, the pictorial image or phrase transferred is\nalways, I believe, a single though perhaps complex concept,\n\u2014a thing very different from any one of Mrs. Willett's scripts,\neach of which presents to us several series of concepts com-\nbined, both as individual concepts and as series or groups,\nin logical connexion. And the simple truth is that up to the\npresent, at any rate, we have no reasonable ground for sup-\nposing that the embodied mind can either give out or receive,\nafter the manner of the telegraphic instrument, long and\nlogically connected messages such as are produced in the\nscripts. It may be that it can both give and receive messages\nof this character, and we may some day get proof of this\npower, but as I have already said, our present evidence points\nthe other way.\nIf M. du Potet's case, referred to above, should again seem\nto suggest a different conclusion, I would repeat that the\nthing transferred was essentially different from the scripts ;\nthe vision was in fact one of the kind just mentioned as some-\ntimes flashed from the dying. And though M. du Potet was\nin no critical situation and had no conscious intention to\ntransfer his own mental impression of M. Dubois, we do not\nknow what his subliminal was doing ; his earnest desire to\nget into relations with his friend might well have stimulated\nit into becoming (according to what seems to me the more\nprobable view of the modus operandi) the active factor in\nthe transference. I find it very difficult to believe that the\nmental picture seen in the vision was not vividly present\nto M. du Potet's subliminal consciousness.\nBut, it will be said, it is precisely this power of conveying\nand receiving a connected message which believers in the\nestablishment of communication with the spirit world attri-\nbute to the spirit and the automatist respectively. Why\nadmit its exercise in the one case and deny it in the other ?\nThe point is a strong one, and perhaps the strongest that\ncan be urged in favour of the telepathic and against the\nspiritistic view of the phenomena. The answer I would give\nis, firstly, that we must suppose a disembodied spirit to be\nfree from many limitations which beset the embodied mind\nwhen endeavouring to effect a telepathic communication ;\nand secondly, that the distinction appears to be warranted,\n\f332 Rev. M. A. Bayfield. [part\nor rather demanded, by the evidence as a whole. It is the\ncontent of the messages which weighs. Some scripts embody,\nin the form of a connected composition, information which\nis outside the knowledge of any automatist in the group con-\ncerned, and at the same time profess to be messages from\nthe spirit world. Clearly the internal evidence of genuine-\nness in such cases is strong, and especially so if the content\nof the message is also characteristic of the alleged communi-\ncator, as in some of Mr. Dorr's sittings with Mrs. Piper. On\nthe other hand, some scripts, also professing to be spirit com-\nmunications and written in connected language, fail to exhibit\nthese marks of genuineness. There is, I believe, no clear\nevidence or plausible ground for thinking that any such\n'\nmessages '\nemanate from some other incarnate mind ; and\nif we prefer not to consider them genuine, the natural account\nof them would seem to be that they are products of the auto-\nmatist's own subliminal. In many scripts this certainly seems\nto be the case. If it be further objected that such connected\nmessages or communications may nevertheless be dictated by\nthe subliminal of some person outside the ring of automatists\nand sitters, one can only reply that it may indeed be so, but\nthat in the absence of evidence in its support, the suggestion\ncannot carry more weight than any other mere possibility.\nThe result of our examination appears to be that there\nis a lack both of positive evidence and of reasonable proba-\nbility such as would warrant our accepting any one of Mr.\nBalfour's first three alternatives as an explanation of the\nphenomena presented by the scripts under discussion. In\nother words,\u2014and it is the whole of the contention which\nthis paper set out to maintain\u2014though we leave it indifferent\nwhich of two mutually exclusive views is taken as to certain\nquestions, psychological and other, which have emerged in\nthe course of the discussion, it seems impossible, without\nignoring the trend of our present evidence and knowledge,\nto construct any coherent and plausible theory of telepathy\nbetween the living which would account for the production\nof these astonishing scripts. If, as is only too probable,\nI have done the facts or the argument any injustice, due\ncorrection will no doubt be forthcoming. I shall kiss the\nrod.\n\fLXIX.] The History of Marthe Bemud. 333\nVII.\nTHE HISTORY OF MARTHE BERAUD (\"EVA C\").\nBy Helen de G.

From\nthe days of \" Katie King \" onwards many contributions have\nbeen made to the subject, of varying interest and importance,\n\f334 Helen de G. Verrall. [part\nbut few are more worthy of consideration, either on account\nof the care with which the researches have been conducted,\nor the conclusions which the authors have reached, than the\nvolume in which Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing describes his\nexperiences during the last few years with the French medium,\nMarthe Beraud (\" Eva C\").\nDr. von Schrenck's personal acquaintance with the case\ndates from the earlier half of 1909, but Marthe Beraud's\ncareer as a medium began in 1903, and before we turn to the\nconsideration of Dr. von Schrenck's book, some account\nmust be given of the medium's earlier history.\nThe first experiments with Marthe Beraud were conducted\nat the Villa Carmen in Algiers, the house of General and Madame\nNoel, who were in the habit of holding seances, in which\nvarious mediums, professional and otherwise, took part.\nMademoiselle Beraud, at that time a very young girl of about\nseventeen, was a family friend and not a professional medium\nAccounts of the phenomena observed at these seances were\npublished in various spiritualistic papers, and in August,\n1905, Professor Charles Richet went over to Algiers to in-\nvestigate the case. He published an account of his observa-\ntions in the Annales des Sciences Psychiques, 1905, pp. 649 ff.\nThe phenomena witnessed by Monsieur Richet consisted\nin the alleged materialisation of several spirits, in particular\nof an Arab chieftain, who gave himself the name of Bien-\nBoa, and showed in various ways that he possessed the attri-\nbutes of a living human being. The problem therefore was\nto ascertain whether the part of Bien-Boa could possibly\nbe played either by Marthe or by an accomplice. The con-\nclusions to which Monsieur Richet came were that :\n(a) at the sittings at which he was present, any action\non the part of an accomplice was excluded and therefore,\nif there was fraud, it was practised by Marthe Beraud and,\nmoreover, was deliberate ;\n(b) the phenomena were almost certainly genuine, although\nMonsieur Richet did not commit himself to any definite theory\nto explain them.\nI do not propose to discuss Monsieur Richet's article in\ndetail, but one point is worth mentioning. Several photo-\ngraphs were taken at the sittings with a view to obtaining,\n\flxix.] The History of Marthe Bemud. 335\nif possible, definite evidence to prove that Marthe and Bien-\nBoa were present simultaneously. These photographs show\nthe bearded figure of Bien-Boa himself wrapped in a white\ngarment of a nondescript character and wearing on his head\neither a turban or a sort of helmet. What appears to be a\npart of Marthe's form is also represented in these photographs,\nbut in no instance are her hands or head visible. This\nfact suggests prima facie that what we see in the photographs\nis Marthe's blouse and skirt, stuffed perhaps and suitably\ndisposed on a chair, whilst she herself is occupied in represent-\ning the Arab chief. Monsieur Richet himself is at some\ntrouble to explain these photographs, and on one occasion\naccounts for the apparent emptiness of Marthe's sleeve by\nsuggesting that \"the phenomenon, so mysterious and almost\nmiraculous, which we call '\nmaterialisation,' is accompanied\nby a sort of disintegration of the pre-existing matter, so\nthat . . . the medium empties herself, so to speak, to constitute\nthe new being, which emanates from her, and which one\ncannot touch without injuring the medium.\"\nOn the other hand, Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing explains a\nsomewhat similar phenomenon, which was observed by\nMonsieur de Fontenay at Paris, during Marthe Beraud's later\nphase, as being due to the \" so-called transfiguration \" of the\nmedium, who \"in a spiritualistic sense takes over the part\nof the spirit, and clad in materialised stuffs tries to represent\ndramatically the character which is at the moment in ques-\ntion.\" (See Materialisationsphdnomene, p. 157.) According\nto Dr. von Schrenck, therefore, what Monsieur Richet pro-\nbably witnessed at the Villa Carmen was a \" transfiguration\n\"\nof the medium, the supernormality of the phenomenon con-\nsisting in the \" materialised \" clothes worn by Bien-Boa.\nShortly after the publication of Monsieur Richet's report,\nseveral people came forward with statements to the effect\nthat all the phenomena witnessed at the Villa Carmen were\nproduced by an organised conspiracy of fraud, in which Marthe\nBeraud and several servants, employed by General and Madame\nNoel, were involved,\u2014in particular the coachman Areski, who\nfrequently took part in the sittings, although he had not\nbeen present on the particular occasions described in Mon-\nsieur Richet's report. It was alleged that not only Areski,\nY\n\f336 Helen de G. Verrall. [part\nbut also Marthe Beraud and her father, had confessed to\ncomplicity in the fraud. These allegations were all set forth\nin a series of articles by Dr. Rouby and Monsieur Marsault,\nand published in Les Nouveaux Horizons, 1906 and 1907.\nThe most important part of the story for our present purpose\nis contained in a statement made by Monsieur Marsault, a\nlawyer living in Algiers, of which the following is a translation,\nconsiderably abridged (see Les Nouveaux Horizons, 1906,\npp. 403 ff.) :\nIt was towards the end of the year 1900 that 1 made acquaint-\nance with Monsieur and Madame Noel. ... I was invited to\nthe seances at the Villa Carmen and attended them regularly\nfor several months. There was much talk at the time of an\nold medium Ahmed, a servant of Monsieur and Madame Noel,\nand of the strange phenomena obtained through his presence\n:\nthe apport of a stone of seventy kilograms, the changing of tea\ninto coffee. . . . One need only read, for example, a few numbers\nof the Revue Scientifique et Morale de Spiritisme of that date to\nrealise the improbability and grotesque nature [of these pheno-\nmena.] . . . Bien-Boa already existed, but he had not shown\nhimself in a materialised form. At that time he was only giving\nwhat I will call the current coin of spiritualism : movements of\ntables, lights, automatic writing, etc., and already promising future\nmaterialisations.\n[Monsieur Marsault then describes how on two occasions he\ndetected the fraudulent practices of a medium, who was perform-\ning at the Villa Carmen.] ... A few days after this seance I\nreceived a letter from Madame Noel, politely requesting me, by\nreason of my inharmonious fluiclic force, to stay at home, until\nthe phenomena should have returned to their normal course. . . .\nMy banishment lasted four years. During that time I had\nmaintained strictly courteous relations with Monsieur and Madame\nNoel, whose suspicions of me increased daily. They even came to\nbelieve that my advice was the cause of certain differences of\nopinion which had arisen between them and their son Maurice,\nwho had become my intimate friend.\nMaurice went off to the French Congo about July, 1900, as\ncommercial agent in a large business enterprise, after engaging\nhimself to Mademoiselle Marthe B whom he was to marry\n\fLXIX-.] The History of Marihe Beraud. 337\nwhen he obtained his first leave. . . . My unhappy friend was not\ndestined to return from the Congo. . . . He died at Libreville in\nOctober, 1904. . . . My friend Monsieur Journau and I paid a visit\nof condolence to the Noel family. General Noel had just received a\nposthumous letter from his son, praising me and clearing away the\nmisunderstanding which had existed between us for several years.\nVery loyally\u2014and I thank him for it\u2014General Noel recognised\nthis misunderstanding, and our reconciliation was sealed. . . . No\none therefore will do me the injustice of supposing for a moment\nthat the attitude which I have adopted in regard to the Bergolia\nand Bien-Boa episodes was dictated by any animosity. . . .\nMy visit of condolence had re-established the cordiality of our\nrelations. My friend Monsieur Journau and I were invited to a\nfamily supper at the Villa Carmen and to the seance for materiali-\nsation which was to follow\nMy friend and I received letters at that time from Madame Noel,\ninforming us that a spirit, Bergolia, sister to Bien-Boa, was appearing\nin materialised form, \" drinking tea with her, talking in the most\nfeminine way imaginable, rummaging about in a box of sweets.\"\nIn one of these letters Madame Noel even said that their son Maurice\nhad materialised, that he had kissed her, and that she had felt\non her forehead the cold touch of his eye-glasses.\nI paid a visit to Marthe B.'s family. I did not get to the bottom\nof the mystery, but Marthe B. spoke to me of a certain Ninon,\nwho was then playing the part of medium at the Villa Carmen.\nI understood that it was Ninon who simulated the materialisation\nof Maurice Noel. Marthe B. added :\n\" Ninon had better not simulate\nmy fiance before me, or I'll jump at her face.\"\n... To return to Madame Noel's invitation.\nIt was in November, 1904, about a month after the death of\nour friend Maurice Noel, that Monsieur Journau and I went to the\nsupper and the seance, to which we had been bidden. At the end\nof the meal, Monsieur and Madame Noel went away for a few\nminutes, leaving my friend Monsieur Journau and me alone with\nMademoiselle Marthe B.\nShe at once said to us, in some such words as these :\n\" Do you\nwant to have some fun ? You know Bergolia is all humbug ;\nmy sisters and I will give you some fun.\" Monsieur Journau was\nastounded. For my part, I had already been warned by Marthe\nB. that all these materialisations were non-existent, which I had\n\f338 Helen de G. Verrall. [part\nlong suspected, but I had thought that for once Bergolia would\nmiss her appointment. At this juncture, there arrived Marthe\nB.'s two young sisters. Ninon, who was expected that evening,\ndid not come. . . .\nWe entered the seance room and sat down round a table in front\nof the cabinet reserved for the medium. A red lamp gave a very\nfaint light, enough however to see outlines, light tones especially.\nWe had hardly taken our places, when Marthe B. kept her promise.\nShe rose from the table, entered the mediumistic cabinet and\ncame out with a thin white shawl over her head and shoulders.\nShe walked about the little room, carefully avoiding the better\nlighted parts, answering first in French to the questions which\nMadame Noel put to her about Bien-Boa and then at Madame\nNoel's request inventing a sort of language, which she said was\nHindu. . . .\nThis little comedy lasted about twenty minutes. . . . Monsieur\nand Madame Noel, whose absolute good faith I have never doubted,\nbelieved blindly that the sister of their favourite spirit was present.\nTo seek to undeceive them was utterly futile. All who have\nexperience of spiritualists know that this is labour lost. . . .\nMoreover, Marthe B. was not a professional medium. Bergolia,\nI think, never did much harm to any one, not even to Monsieur\nand Madame Noel, who did not wait for her entry into our\nworld to believe in materialisations. . . .\nSuch events would have left no room for doubt even in the mind\nof St. Thomas. Monsieur Journau and I had no doubt whatever.\nWe did not attend any further seances at the Villa Carmen in\nspite of the pressing invitations which Ave subsequently received.\nThis was, I think, the wisest course.\nI come now to the critical point, namely, Bien-Boa as sanctified\nby the authority of Monsieur Richet, Bien-Boa, turned into a public\ncharacter, known to all. . . .\nI had learnt that Monsieur Richet had come to the Villa Carmen\nto study for the second time the phenomena of materialisation.\nKnowing what I have related above, I thought that no one could\nhave the audacity or the simplicity to simulate before a great\nsavant like Monsieur Richet the materialisation of Bien-Boa. I\nwas convinced that should this occur, Monsieur Richet would\ndiscover the hoax. . . .\nI leave to the imagination my amazement when I read in the\n\fLXIX.] The History of Martlie Beraud. 339\nAnnates Psychiques for December, 1905, Monsieur Richet's report\non the materialisations at the Villa Carmen. . . .\nIn the fight against these trickeries, so often unmasked . . .\nno honest endeavour is to be despised. That is what I thought,\nwhen I determined to help so far as I could in the discovery of\nthe facts. ... I at once considered what was the best way to attain\nthe proposed end. I put aside all idea of publicity. ... I thought\nit best to act discreetly. This was the only method which could\nreconcile the interests of unrecognised truth with the peace of\nmind of my friends at the Villa Carmen, the reputation of a young\ngirl of good family, and above all the susceptibility of a man of\nlearning. . . .\nWhen I reached this stage of my reflexions, I had learnt from\nMarthe B.'s father . . . that the observed phenomena were fraudu-\nlent and that Marthe had done nothing but amuse herself. . . . Mon-\nsieur B. was very much surprised and troubled at the unexpected\npublicity which had been given to the matter. ... I expressed\nthe opinion that he ought to confess the truth to Monsieur Richet\nand I strongly urged him to do this in the interests of all.\nOn my part, I wrote to Monsieur Richet, as follows :\n\"... For the last five years or so I have taken an interest-\nin psychical research and during this time I also have known the\nVilla Carmen.\nI think that I shall be serving the cause of truth and doing a\nwise and useful deed if I come to you and say that \/ fear greatly\nthat you have been deceived.\nMy strong conviction is based upon the most serious grounds.\nIf you are willing, whilst turning to your own use the statements\nI shall make to you, to promise me complete silence as regards\nboth them and my name, I will tell you the grounds of my con-\nviction. ...\"\nMy letter was well received by Monsieur Richet, who replied\nas follows :\n\" I am prepared to receive in absolute confidence any dis-\nclosures you may wish to make to me and you may accept my word\nof honour that your name will not be mentioned. ...\"\n... On January 1, [1906], I went to see [Marthe and her father]\nat their house and met the whole family, Monsieur and Madame\nB. and their three daughters. During the three hours that I was\nthere we talked only of Bien-Boa. With much volubility and a\n\f340 Helen de G. Verrall. [paet\ncertain humour Marthe related all the ins and outs of the story.\nShe had been medium against her will, because Madame Noel\nfound a mediumistic significance in her least gestures and saw\nspirits everywhere . . .\nWhen Monsieur Bichet came, she had long been established\nas a \" great materialising medium.\" How was she to escape\nexamination by this man of learning 1 She protected herself by\nasserting that she was not a medium at all and did not believe\nin spirits. But they pressed her with such insistence that at last\nshe gave way and went back to the cabinet in the seance-room. . . .\nThus it was that little by little against her will she had been led\nto play her part. And what part ? A secondary, almost a negative,\npart. There was a trap-door set between the bath and the wall,\nin the angle, through which, when the room had been darkened,\na young girl was introduced, slim and dressed in black, a friend\nof Ninon's. ... As to Marthe herself, her part was secondary ;\nshe remained passive and pretended to sleep. . . . She was very\nrepentant at having set her hand to trickery, but put forward as\nher constant excuse, the compulsory role of medium which she\nhad been obliged to play and the existence of the trap-door. She\npleaded extenuating circumstances.\nThe publicity given to a farce which they thought trivial terri-\nfied Marthe and her family. I pointed out to them that the only\nway to put an end to the thing was to tell the truth quite frankly\nto Monsieur Richet. .\nThe next day I wrote to Monsieur Richet, as follows :\n\"... Monsieur B. and Mademoiselle Marthe B. herself have\ngiven me their confidence.\nThey have told me 1\nthat the whole affair was a sham, that there\nwas a trap-door and accomplices. Everything was explained to\nme in detail.\nIf I am to believe 1\nMarthe B., her part was rather slight, and\nalmost negative ; she remained passive. . . .\nI have strongly urged her to open her mind to you frankly in\nconversation, since you have given her reason to hope for your\nreturn in a letter which she has shown me.\n1\nNote by Monsieur Marsault.

It is quite possible that there\nwas trickery that I was unable to discover. But the trickery must\nbe proved.\nYou write to me of a trap-door and accomplices. Well ! nothing\nis easier than to ascertain the existence of a trap-door in the summer-\nhouse at the Villa Carmen. ...\"\nIt was my intention to write to Monsieur Richet to point out to\nhim that I did not believe in the hypothesis of the trap-door,\u2014\na\nconvenient method by which Marthe might partly exculpate her\nself,\u2014although I was convinced of the trickery . . . when, on\nJanuary 11, I met Monsieur B. He told me that Marthe had had\na letter from a lady in Paris telling her that a lawyer in Algiers\nhad written to Monsieur Richet to inform him of the deception. . . .\nMonsieur B. iirferred that the Algerian lawyer was myself. . . .\nWhen I saw that my discreet intervention with Monsieur Richet\nwas becoming everybody's secret, I determined to write to Mon-\nsieur Richet no more. . . .\nIn the early days of March, Dr. Rouby of Algiers thought he\nhad discovered the key to the trickery in the person of Areski,\nMonsieur Noel's former coachman. ... To destroy this hypothesis\nGeneral Noel put forward the equivocal nature of Areski's state-\nments and wished to prove his inconsistency before witnesses.\nGeneral Noel came to me on March 12 and asked me to be\none of the witnesses. I agreed, on condition that Areski should\nbe cross-examined in Dr. Rouby's presence,\u2014-which I thought a\nreasonable suggestion. General Noel would not agree to this\ncondition and in return I refused the favour he asked of\nme. . . .\nTwo days later I received a letter from Madame Noel, bitterly\nreproaching me for my behaviour. ... I quote some interesting\npassages from this letter :\n\" I assumed that you were one of the '\nanonymous young\nmen '\nof whom the delightful Rouby spoke.\nMy opinion was confirmed by what you said to the General\nabout Mademoiselle Marthe B. ; but she repudiates your statements\nutterly. ... I think that an impartial person, having to choose\n\f342 Helen cle G. Verrall.

But considering the circumstances\nof the case, Monsieur Marsault's story certainly required an\nanswer and a refutation. The most important part of the\nstorjr, however, has never been answered at all. In an article\ncontributed by Monsieur Richet to the Annates des Sciences\nPsychiques (March, 190G), in which he is mainly concerned\nwith disproving Dr. Rouby's contentions, the following\npassages occur\n:\n. . . He [Dr. Rouby] relates that in the presence of two young\nmen, who would not refuse to give their evidence, she [Marthe\nBeraud] played, for a joke, the part of Bergolia, Bien-Boa's\nsister. . . .\nAs to the so-called confession of Mademoiselle Marthe B. . .\nshe is alleged to have said that everything was done by means\nof a trap-door, whereas in the first place she has not said so, and\nin the second place there is no trap-door . . .\nA foot-note is put to this last statement, as follows :\nThe existence of this notorious trap-door, about which a lawyer\nin Algiers wrote me an excited letter which some day I will publish,\nis disproved by the following affidavit : [the statement of the\narchitect who examined the seance-room].\nThis is the only direct allusion to Monsieur Marsault which\nMonsieur Richet's article contains, and it will be at once\napparent that . it leaves Monsieur Marsault's main contention\nquite untouched, because the latter is careful to point out that\nhe takes no responsibility for the statement about the trap-\ndoor, and that the existence of this door is in no way essential.\n\fLXIX.] The History of Marihe Beraud. 343\nto his conclusions. If Monsieur Richet had reasons of his\nown for discrediting Monsieur Marsault's statement, why were\nthey not given ? The \" impartial person,\" to whom Madame\nNoel appeals, will, I think, conclude that the whole episode is\nmost unsatisfactory, and of a nature to arouse grave suspicions.\nSo much then for Marthe Beraud's early history.\nIn 190S \"Eva C\", as she is now to be called, came\nto Paris, and early in 1909 she began to give sittings\nfor a small private circle formed under the auspices of\nMonsieur and Madame Alexandre Bisson. Monsieur Bisson\nwas a well-known French playwright : he died in January,\n1912. Madame Bisson is a sculptress of some repute. Dr. von\nSchrenck-Notzing was introduced into this circle in May, 1909.\nand his observation of the phenomena has continued from\nthen up to the present time.\nBefore turning to the consideration of these phenomena,\nsomething must be said with regard to the concealment of\nthe medium's identity. In Materialisationsplianomene Dr.\nvon Schrenck-Notzing describes \" Eva C.\" as \" a young girl\nof the middle classes who has already in other circles produced\nphenomena of materialisation.\" He is not permitted, he\nsays, to give precise details as to her family and circumstances.\nHer identity with Marthe Beraud became known in December,\n1913 (one of the earliest statements of it appeared in the\nMatin on December 29, 1913), and no attempt was made\nto deny it. In Der Kampf um die Materialisationsphanomene.\na pamphlet recently published by Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing\nin reply to various criticisms of his book, he minimises the\nimportance of Eva C.'s identity by making light of the dis-\nclosures in regard to Marthe Beraud. \" It is a long recognised\nfact (he says) that every report about mediumistic phenomena\nis speedily followed by a sensational account of exposure.\nSince statements in the newspapers have for many people\nthe authority of a gospel ... it is not surprising that such\nstatements are more readily accepted than observations\nwhich are inconsistent with public opinion and scientific\northodoxy.\" He then dismisses Dr. Rouby's contentions\nas \" gossip of the lowest sort \" ; with Monsieur Marsault's\nstory he does not deal at all.\n\f344 Helen tie G. Verrall. [part\nBut Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing's defence does not meet\nthe objections of those who think that whether the accusa-\ntions against Marthe Beraud were well-founded or not,\nstudents of her subsequent phenomena should have been\ngiven the opportunity of judging the case for themselves.\nThe refusal of her family to allow her name to be published\nput Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing in a difficulty, no doubt ;\nbut, if this difficulty was insuperable, it would at least have\nbeen possible to insert a statement that she had not an abso-\nlutely clean record. The omission of any such statement\nwould naturally be interpreted as implying that she had.\nAs regards the phenomena observed in the case of Eva\nC, they are of one kind only,\n\u2014\"materialisation.\" The problem\ntherefore resolves itself into two questions : (a) what is the\nnature of this \" materialised \" substance 1 (b) what possibility\nis there that the medium smuggles this substance into the\nsittings by some normal means not detected by the\nobservers ? In order to answer these questions, some\naccount must now be given of the phenomena observed and\nof the conditions under which they occur.\nDuring the production of the phenomena, the medium\nsits in a three-cornered \" cabinet,\" consisting of black cloth\nstretched over a wooden frame-work. The cabinet, which\nfits into one corner of the room, is completely closed at the\ntop and bottom and on two sides ; in front are two curtains\n(of black cloth) running on a rod. These curtains are usualty\nunder the control of the medium, who opens or closes them\nat her pleasure ; at some of the later sittings, however, the\ncurtains remained open or partly open during the whole\ntime. The sittings always take place by artificial light,\nusually red light, but in some cases subdued white light was\nused. The light varied in intensity, and on this point, as on\nothers, better conditions were gradually imposed ; at the\nlater sittings it was possible to read good print, standing at\na distance of two or three yards from the light. Within\nthe cabinet there was of course no light at all, except such\nas shone through the open curtains. One advantage of using\nred light was that the shutters of the various photographic\napparatuses could then be left open, ready for use by flash\nlight at a moment's notice. On many occasions several\n\fLXIX.] The History of Marthe Beraud. 345\ncameras were used simultaneously and the phenomena were\nphotographed from the front, from the side and from above.\nInteresting evidence was thus obtained as regards the dimen-\nsions of the phenomena ; on this point more will be said\nlater.\nDuring the sittings the medium is, ostensibly at least, in a\nhypnotic trance, Madame Bisson being usually the hypnotiser.\nDoubts have been cast by some critics on the genuineness of\nthe trance (a question which Dr. von Schrenck does not dis-\ncuss at all), but compared with establishing the genuineness\nof the phenomena, the point is of secondary interest. It\nhas also been suggested that the medium may be assisted\nby an accomplice, a suggestion arising naturally out of the\nsuspicions cast upon her earlier performances. But there\nis no evidence in support of this hypothesis, and at many\nof the sittings strong evidence against it.\nIf complicity is suspected, suspicion will naturally fall on\nMadame Bisson, both on account of her close personal\nrelations with the medium, who has for some years lived\nin her house as one of the family, and because she is\nthe only person who has been present at all the sittings\n(with a few unimportant exceptions). I must apologise to\nMadame Bisson for discussing so frankly the question of her\ngood faith ; she will see the necessity of this course from a\nscientific point of view.\nIt should at once be said that Madame Bisson has no financial\ninterest in the phenomena, and it is very difficult to see what\nmotive could induce a woman of her standing to enter into\na conspiracy for their production. But besides the absence\nof motive for fraud, there is, on some occasions at least, good\nevidence for the absence of opportunity. During the earlier\nsittings Madame Bisson was allowed to enter the cabinet\nduring the production of the phenomena, and under these\ncircumstances she might conceivably have supplied the\nmedium with materials of some sort ; but at many of the\nlater sittings she did not enter the cabinet at all, no contact\nwas allowed between her and the medium except during the\nprocess of hypnotisation, when she held the medium's hands\nfor a minute or two under strict supervision, and on several\noccasions Madame Bisson herself was very thoroughly searched\n\f346 Helen de G. Verrall. [part\nbefore the sitting and dressed in clothes which had been care-\nfully examined by the investigators. A detailed description\nof these conditions will be found, e.g., on p. 320 of Materiali-\nsationsphanomene, in the report of a sitting held on August 15?\n1912, and in Der Kampf um die Materialisationsphanomene\n(pp. 30 ff.) Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing quotes an account of\nthis sitting by Dr. von Gulat-Wellenburg, who was present\nat it. The two statements are in agreement, and although\nDr. von Gulat-Wellenburg has shown himself one of Dr. von\nSchrenck-Notzing's keenest critics, he seems to have been\nquite satisfied with the conditions as regards Madame Bisson.\nIt may therefore be taken as established, I think, that in\nsome sittings at any rate, the sole agent in the immediate\nproduction of the phenomena was the medium herself.\nThe question as to whether she had any assistance in pre-\nparing the materials (assuming them to be prepared) is quite\ndistinct. Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing, however, states that, with-\nout his knowledge, Madame Bisson and Eva C. were shadowed\nfor eight months by the agents of a well-known Paris detec-\ntive bureau. But the \" anonymous employer \" of these\ndetectives did not succeed in obtaining \" any evidence what-\never of fraud, or in tracing the shop from which the materials\nrequired for the sittings . . . might have been obtained.\"\n(See Materialisationsplidnomene, Introd. pp. vii and viii.)\nIt will be convenient at this point to give a brief account\nof the nature of the \" materialisations,\" some of which I shall\nafterwards describe more in detail. Roughly speaking, they\nmay be divided into two classes :\n(a) Vague masses of no definite shape, sometimes more\nor less globular, sometimes ribbon-like, white or greyish\nwhite in colour and, on some occasions at least, semi-fluid.\n(b) Objects having a definite shape. These are chiefly\nof two kinds, arms, including hands and fingers, and heads.\nThe arms and hands are usually flat and look as though they\nhad been cut out of some white material of a flexible nature.\nBut there are two or three instances of \"plastic\" fingers,\nwell modelled and showing the outline of the nails. The\nheads also are sometimes flat, and sometimes appear to be\nmodelled in bas-relief. The ground colour of all these objects\nis white or grey. In the case of the heads the features\n\fLXIX.] The History of Marthe Bemud. 347\nfrequently present the appearance of being drawn in black on\na white ground.\nIf these \" materialisations \" are fraudulently produced\nwithout the help of a confederate, they must either be con-\ncealed in the cabinet before the sittings begin, or they must\nbe brought into the cabinet by the medium on her own person.\nThe cabinet and the only article of furniture which it con-\ntains, the chair on which the medium sits, are always searched\ncarefully before each sitting. The medium is not in the room\nduring the search. At the sittings described in Materialisa-\ntionsphanomene the chair, which was of wicker, was covered\nwith narrow strips of black cloth, wound round the various\nparts of the chair, the reason given being that the reflexions\nfrom the polished surface of the wicker were confusing in the\nphotographs. It has been suggested that small objects,\ne.g. rolls of paper, concealed between the chair and the cloth,\nmight have escaped notice in the search. It is conceivable\nthat fraud of this nature may have been practised on one\nor two occasions without detection, but the hypothesis appears\nquite inadequate to explain the phenomena as a whole,\nespecially in vieAV of the fact that in December, 1913, the\ncloth was stripped off, and the phenomena were not affected\nby the change. We are therefore forced back upon the other\nhypothesis, that, in some cases, at least, the medium conceals\nthe necessary materials on her own person.\nShe also was carefully searched before each sitting, and\nwore clothes specially designed for the occasion,\u2014tights of\nblack stockinette (hose and stockings in one piece), reaching\nto the waist, and a loose black tunic fastening behind. The\nwhole surface of her body was carefully examined by Dr.\nvon Schrenck-Notzing (and occasionally by other investigators),\nher hair, nose, mouth and ears were also investigated and\nsometimes (without any previous warning to the medium) a\ngynaecological examination took place. With one very\ndoubtful exception, into which I need not enter here, nothing\nsuspicious was ever observed. After the medium had been\nexamined, the tunic was securely sewn to the tights at the\nwaist ; it was also sewn closely round the medium's neck and\nwrists, so that she could not get access to any part of her body,\nexcept her head and hands, without breaking the threads.\n\f34S Helen de G. Verrall. [part\nThis method of procedure leaves only one of the natural\norifices of the body free and accessible, namely the mouth,\nand this fact, taken in conjunction with certain characteristics\nof the observed phenomena, has led some critics to suggest,\nas an explanation of the whole case, that the medium possesses\nthe faculty of \" regurgitation.\" For this theory there is,\nprima facie at least, a good deal of evidence, and it deserves\ncareful consideration.\nThe question is discussed in detail in Moderne Medium-\nforschung, a criticism of Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing's book by\nDr. Mathilde von Kemnitz and Dr. von Gulat-Wellenburg. \" A\n'\nregurgitator,' \" says Dr. von Kemnitz (op. cit. p. 12) \"is dis-\ntinguished from other men, in that without any sensation\nof sickness, without retching or sound or trouble of any kind,\nhe can at any time at will bring up into his mouth the con-\ntents of his stomach.\" Dr. von Gulat-Wellenburg (op. cit.\npp. 63 ff.) gives an account of a remarkable case of \" regurgi-\ntation \" which came under his observation.\nThe subject, Hermann W., was a man who in 1913 gave\npublic exhibitions, at which he swallowed as many as twenty\nliving frogs and fishes, having first drunk a large quantity of\nwater, held them in his stomach as long as he chose, and brought\nthem up again alive, without any sound or visible symptom\nof vomiting. Hermann W. is sixty-three years old and in\ngood health. He has had the power of regurgitation from\nbabyhood and can usually inhibit it, although sometimes\nwith difficulty. For many years his wife remained in ignor-\nance of his peculiarity. Dr. von Gulat-Wellenburg tried\nseveral experiments with the man, making him swallow a\nlong roll of chiffon, an india-rubber glove, and several pieces\nof thin paper, folded up. All these objects Hermann W.\nswallowed and brought up again without any difficulty.\nWe have information of a family, several members of which\nhave the same power and could probably develop it with\npractice such as Hermann W. has given to it.\nThere are several points in the evidence upon Eva C.'s\nphenomena which suggest \" regurgitation,\" as Dr. von\nSchrenck-Notzing himself admits. (See Materialisations-\nphanomene, p. 355.) In the first place the materialised\nsubstance has frequently been observed to issue from the\n\fLXIX.] The History of Marthe Beraud. 349\nmedium's mouth. A particularly clear instance of this is\ndescribed in the report of a sitting held on August 21, 1911\n(see MaterialisationspTianomene, pp. 179 ff.). The medium's\nhands and feet were controlled, and under these circumstances\n\" a long shred of tissue, which appeared to be in direct con-\nnexion with her body, and to be guided by its movements,\nshowed itself several times in the light.\" Dr. von Schrenck-\nNotzing asked that this material should lay itself in his hand,\nand after several attempts his wish was gratified, and a\nphotograph taken of the phenomenon.\nThe tissue, which remained motionless for about six seconds,\ncame out of Eva's mouth, as the stereoscopic print clearly shows,\nand ended in my hand. It appeared to be transparent in parts\nand flexible like india-rubber. The substance, which lay in my\nhand, struck me as heavy in proportion to its size and comparable\nto some heavy organic substance (Mesenterium ?) ; it was damp,\ncold and slimy, and gave the impression of a long fibrous, irregu-\nlarly-shaped piece of membrane, of a definite consistencjr and\nformation.\nLater in the sitting a second photograph was taken :\nWe see . . . the medium's two hands holding the curtains\nand her head thrust out through the opening. . . . The front\npart of her face and the substance, issuing from her mouth and held\nby it, are outside the curtains.\nThis is only one of many occasions upon which the\nmaterialised substance was clearly seen to come from the\nmedium's mouth, and the nature of this substance, as described\nby Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing (he speaks of it as damp and\nslimy), is perfectly consistent with the hypothesis that it has\nbeen swallowed and brought up. Other evidence can also be\nadduced to support this contention. At a sitting held on\nSeptember 8, 1912 (see Materialisationsphanomene, pp. 333 ff.) :\nStrips of the material [were seen] on the bodice of the [medium's]\ndress. . . . We ascertained by repeatedly touching her dress,\nthat the parts where the material had been observed were wet,\nas though moistened by a slimy substance. . . . An investigation\nof the dress [after the sitting] disclosed on the breast and lap a\ngroup of irregular, whitish-grey spots . . . and in particular a\n\f350 Helen cle G. Verrall. [part\nlong streak below the waist, . . . just where I [Dr. von Schrenck-\nNotzing] had seen the bright streak disappear [as described in the\nreport of the sitting].\nThe substance of wbich these spots were composed, and\nseveral other very small quantities of the \" materialisations,\"\nobtained at other sittings, were subjected to careful analysis\n(cf. Materialisationsphanomene, pp. 439 ff.). The general con-\nclusion to be drawn from this analysis appears to be that\nthe substance is of an organic nature, somewhat resembling\nsaliva, but not identical with it. So far as the result of the\nanalysis goes, there seems to be no trace of any substance\nwhich might not be produced by normal, or only slightly\nabnormal, secretions from the human body. But one of the\nunsatisfactory features of the case is that it has never been\npossible to obtain for subsequent analysis any fragment of\nwhat may be called the solid materialisations. Several\nattempts have been made (one of them forcible), but all that\nhas been obtained is a few drops of the moisture by which\nthese materialisations are frequently accompanied. It may\nbe, as Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing maintains, that owing to\nthe nature of the \" ideoplastic \" process (see below, p. 363) by\nwhich these phenomena are produced, it is impossible to seize\nthe substance without the risk of serious injury to the medium.\nBut the facts obviously lend themselves to a more sceptical\ninterpretation. However that may be, the issuing of the\nmaterialised substance from the medium's mouth, and the\nnature of that substance so far as it has been ascertained, lend\ncolour to the regurgitation theory.\nAnother point in favour of this theory for those who are\nnot disposed to believe in the genuineness of the phenomena\nis that the medium would then be provided with an excellent\nhiding-place, in which she might conceal the materials required\nfor her performance both before and after it. This is im-\nportant, because the fact that careful searching has so far\nfailed to reveal anything suspicious has been put forward as\na strong point in her favour. Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing\ncalls attention to this in his introduction :\nSince the special gift of Eva C. is confined solely to the sphere\nof materialisation, the only objection that can be raised is that\n\flxix.] The History of Marthe Beraud. 351\nthe materialised products are somehow fraudulently smuggled\ninto the sittings. The problem of control is proportionately simple,\nsince it is concerned only with preventing the introduction, piecing\ntogether, and removal of any substance. None of all the observers\nwho have attended sittings during these four years has been able\nto show that previously prepared pictures or materials have been\nbrought into the sittings and again removed after use. . . . The\nresult on this point is and remains negative, that is to say, in favour\nof the medium.\nThe methods of search normally employed by Dr. von\nSchrenck-Notzing and his fellow-investigators would, however,\nbe quite useless on the supposition that the materials had been\nswallowed. But attempts were made on several occasions to\ndetect or preclude regurgitation. At three sittings in May,\n1913, the medium's head was enveloped in a net veil, which\nwas firmly sewn to the neck of her tunic. At the first of these\nsittings, on May 2, 1913, a head was seen, which in its general\ncharacter resembles phenomena obtained at earlier sittings,\nthat is to say, the features present the appearance of being\npainted or drawn on some flat material, which is creased in\nseveral places and torn at the edges. Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing\nwas not present at this sitting, which is only cursorily described\nin his book, so that one cannot draw any definite conclusions\nfrom it. At the next sitting on May 9, 1913, \" at 10.14 p.m.\na white strip, about half a yard long, came through the veil\nbefore our eyes and laid itself upon the upper part of her\n[the medium's] left arm.\" At 10.28 p.m. the phenomenon\ndisappeared, but unfortunately no record was made as to\nthe exact manner of its disappearance. A photograph taken\nat 10.17 p.m. shows this white material lying across the\nmedium's left arm with one end in her lap. In general appear-\nance it suggests a strip of very fine butter-muslin.\nThe third sitting, on May 16, 1913, is worth describing in\nsome detail, as it presents one very curious incident. The\nmedium was dressed on this occasion in a close-fitting knitted\ncostume, made all in one piece and opening only at the wrists\nand from the back of the neck to the waist. Her head was\ncovered with a black net veil sewn to the neck of her dress.\n\" An attempt to force a way through at any point with a\nz\n\f352 Helen de 0. Verrall. [part\nsharpened pencil without breaking the stitches was unsuccess-\nful.\" The mesh of the net was about TL inch square. The\nsitters present on this occasion were Dr. Bourbon, Monsieur\nde Vesme, Madame Bisson, and Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing.\nThe general conditions were as usual (see above, p. 344). The\nsitting began at 9.5 p.m. and it is noted that the medium's\nhands remained visible throughout, holding the curtains.\nAt 9.9 p.m. she changed the position of her hands, crossing\nthe forearms, and then replaced them in the usual position,\nthe right hand holding the right curtain, the left hand the\nleft curtain. At 9.25 \"a white substance appeared hanging\nout of her mouth like a great tongue and seemed to be making\nits way through the veil.\" Then a finger was seen at the end\nof this tongue and a photograph was taken, which is thus\ndescribed by Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing :\nEva's mouth is wide open. Part of the veil has been drawn a\nlittle way into the mouth-cavity. One sees plainly that along\nthe whole width of the lower lip a broad mass ... of a matted,\nskein-like nature, is hanging out of the mouth ; it appears to be\nissuing from between the tongue and the lower lip. At the end\nof this skein of threads hangs a finger of natural size, completely\nmodelled and cut clean across at the middle of the first phalanx ;\na thread is wound round the second joint uniting it to the mass\n[above], with which it is not otherwise connected.\nThis photograph is reproduced in Materialisationsphano-\nmene (p. 418) and corresponds with Dr. von Schrenck's de-\nscription, and a side view taken simultaneously is also shown.\nFor several minutes after the photograph was taken, Dr.\nBourbon and Monsieur de Vesme were able to observe this\nfinger. Dr. Bourbon, who had the best view of the incident,\nthus describes it :\nAbout 9.20 p.m. Eva leant forward towards us and we saw the\n\" substance \" coming out of her mouth and certainly on the inner\nside of the veil.\nVery shortly afterwards I perceived that \" something \" was\nhanging out of her mouth and moving up and down on her breast ;\nit was a finger tied to a cord of the substance with which we are\nfamiliar. The finger touched me and in answer to a question\nfrom one of the observers I said that the finger felt dry. Again\n\fLXIX.] The History of Marthe Beraud. 353\nthe medium took my hand and placed it under the object ; I felt\nand now saw clearly and definitely a finger, which was damp and\ncold, fall into the hollow of my hand, where it rolled to and fro\nfor a few moments ; its size appeared to be that of a full-grown\nfinger.\nThe phenomenon vanished.\nEva then allowed me to feel the veil, which was quite wet\nthrough in the region of the mouth as though with saliva. Soon\nafterwards with practically no alteration in the position of the\ncurtains the phenomenon was repeated, the hands remaining in\nfull light throughout. I could now perceive the finger quite clearly ;\nit hung from a grey substance having two or three strands and\nmoved up and down on the medium's breast. Two or three times\nthe finger made distinct bending motions and then disappeared\non the spot, as though it had ceased to be illuminated. This\nmanner of disappearing on the part of the phenomena can often\nbe observed.\nThen Eva rested with her hands laid on her lap, holding the\ncurtain open as often before. Suddenly I saw something white\nbetween her hands which were about ten centimetres apart. I\npointed this out to my fellow-observers and we ascertained that\nwe again had to do with a small finger, which lay parallel to those\nof the medium. Soon it stretched itself slowly and we perceived\nnow that it lay on a mass of the above-mentioned substance, united\nby a cord with the medium's body. A few minutes afterwards\nthe whole thing disappeared into the opening of the curtains and\nthereupon in spite of our wishes nothing more showed itself.\nAt the conclusion of the sitting Eva was searched and the\nveil examined. There were no holes in it and the stitches\nfastening it to the tunic were intact. The \" finger,\" as the\nphotographs clearly show, is cylindrical in form and about\nlife-size ; in fact it does in shape very closely resemble a human\nfinger, showing the slight indentation at the joints and the\noutline of the nail. It appears certain therefore that the\n\" regurgitation \" theory will not by itself suffice to account\nfor this phenomenon. For if the finger came from the\nmedium's mouth and therefore from inside the veil, it must\nhave passed through the veil before it could fall into Mon-\nsieur Bourbon's hand. Taking into account the respective\n\f354 Helen de G. Verrall. [part\ndimensions of the finger and the apertures in the veil,\nit seems that the finger could not have passed through the\nveil by any normal means. We may assume, if we please,\nthat it passed through by some supernormal means (and\nsupposing the finger itself to be of supernormal origin there\nis no knowing what it might do in that way), but considering\nthat it was never seen inside the veil, it is simpler to suppose\nthat it never was inside. We must then dismiss the \" re-\ngurgitation \" theory as an explanation of this phenomenon\nand consider whether there is any other way in which it might\nhave been fraudulently produced.\nWe have two hypotheses to choose from : (a) that the finger\nand the accompanying \" substance \" were concealed by the\nmedium either on her person or in the cabinet, (6) that they\nwere handed to her by some confederate at or after the begin-\nning of the sitting. I have already discussed above the\ncmestion of whether there is any reason to suppose that\nMadame Bisson plays the part of a confederate. Here I\nneed only add that as Madame Bisson was not searched\non this occasion, and held the medium's hands for a few\nmoments during the process of hypnotisation, the possibility\nof her handing something to the medium was not wholly\nexcluded. On the other hand it is only fair to repeat that\nneither on this occasion nor on any other is there a shred of\npositive evidence against Madame Bisson, and there is no\ndoubt that some phenomena do occur without any complicity\non her part. At the same time I would suggest the desir-\nability from the evidential point of view of holding some\nsittings in which Madame Bisson did not approach the cabinet\nat all, or at least in which there was no contact between her\nand the medium. For it is a generally recognised principle\nin scientific experiments to vary all the known conditions,\nin order to discover which, if any, are essential to the pro-\nduction of the observed effects.\nWith regard to the possibility of the medium having con-\ncealed materials of some kind in the cabinet or on her person,\nit should be noted that these materials would have to be\neasily accessible and more or less ready for use. All the\nobservers agree that her hands were continually under observa-\ntion, holding the curtains. I do not think this statement can\n\flxix.] The History of Marthe Bemud. 355\nbe accepted without some reservations (for reasons which\nI shall presently explain) ; nevertheless it is hardly possible\nunder the circumstances that she should have had the\nfree use of the whole of either hand for more than a very\nshort time, too short to admit of any complicated process\nof extracting or manipulating the materials. That being so,\nit is extremely difficult to see where she could have hidden\nan object as large as a human finger, so as to escape detection\nin the preliminary search. It should be noted that the dress\nshe was wearing that day left no part of her body accessible\nexcept her head and hands. Supposing the phenomenon\nto be fraudulent, the finger was probably attached to the\nwhite mass which accompanied it, before the beginning of\nof the sitting. This can be inferred from the argument which\nI have just put forward in regard to the very small oppor-\ntunity, if any, that she had of using her hands.\nMonsieur Bourbon in his report speaks of the \" substance\n\"\ncoming out of the medium's mouth inside the veil. But since\nthe veil had been caught up into her mouth, as the photograph\nshows, it would be extremely difficult in a rather poor light\nto be sure whether the substance was inside or outside. It\nis impossible to determine this point with any certainty\nfrom the photograph, and the fact of the veil being thrust\ninto the mouth is in itself rather suspicious, because this\nproceeding would be necessary on the supposition that the\nmedium, having extracted the material from some place of\nconcealment, wished to make it appear to be streaming from\nher mouth, whereas one does not see why the veil should\nbe caught up in this way, if the phenomenon is genuine.\nIt is interesting on this point to compare the phenomena\nobtained at the previous sitting. \" A white strip,\" says\nDr. von Schrenck-Notzing, \" about half a yard long came\nthrough the veil before our eyes and laid itself upon the upper\npart of her left arm.\" Some of the sitters thought they saw\na finger, but Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing did not see it him-\nself, nor does the photograph show it. At the conclusion of\nthe sitting, about sixteen minutes afterwards, the veil was\nfound to be dry. The photograph, as described above, shows\nthe \" white strip \" lying over her left arm with the end in\nher lap. (See Maierialisationsphdnomene, p. 412.) The veil\n\f356 Helen cle 0. Verrall. [part\nis hanging clown quite clear of her face. No one touched\nthis object, and therefore there is only the evidence of the\nphotograph to show the nature of the material of which it was\ncomposed. This material, as I have said, judging from the\nphotograph, somewhat resembles white butter-muslin. The\nsubstructure is rather filmy in appearance, with coarser\nthreads running through it. At one point there is apparently\na rent in the stuff. Its position, as it hangs from the medium's\narm to her lap, shows that, although limp, it can to some\nextent support its own weight and is not completely fluid.\nIt does not seem that any material presenting the char-\nacteristics above described could be forced through a veil,\nhaving a mesh inch square, by normal means without leaving\nobvious traces of its passage. If therefore we accept the\nstatement that \" the white strip came through the veil,\" it\nis difficult to resist the conclusion that we have to do here\nwith some abnormal phenomenon. This statement is not\nopen to the same objection that can be raised against the\nsimilar statement made in the report on the later sitting\nof May 16, 1913, because on this first occasion the veil was\nnot caught into the medium's mouth. With the veil hanging\nloose, as in the photograph, it would be comparatively easy\nto determine whether the substance was coming from the\nmedium's mouth or not.1\nAt the same time, considering all the circumstances of\nthe case, the conditions of light, etc., an observer might\nbe mistaken on such a point, which brings us up against\none of the inherent difficulties of judging a case of this\nsort on written evidence. To the actual observer the words\n\" I saw it coming from her mouth \" may imply many con-\nvincing details which they do not actually express. To\nsome extent no doubt this difficulty is insuperable ; but I\nthink it might have been partly overcome by a greater\nprecision in detail, especially upon certain crucial points. The\n1\nA photograph taken by Dr. von Schrenck with another \" materialising\n\"\nmedium, Stanislawa P. (see op. cit. pp. 465 ff.) shows a similar white sub-\nstance issuing from her mouth through a veil. This substance certainly\nappears to be inside the veil as well as outside. In my opinion this is one\nof the strongest pieces of evidence for the abnormal nature of the substance\nwhich Dr. von Schrenck has yet published.\n\fLXIX.] The History of Marthe Beraud. 357\nreport of the particular phenomenon which we are now\nconsidering may be taken as a good example of what I mean :\n10.14 p.m. A white strip about half a yard long comes through\nthe veil before our eyes and lays itself upon the upper part of her\nleft arm. . . .\n10.17 p.m. The strip is lying over the medium's left arm and\nthe upper part of her thigh. . . .\n10.25 p.m. The strip visible again.\n10.28 p.m. Eva feels that the phenomenon is about to vanish.\n10.30 p.m. Close of the sitting.\nIt will be seen that between 10.14 p.m. and 10.17 p.m.\nthe white strip changed its position considerably. Was there\nan opportunity for continuous observation during this period\nand if so, why are not the movements of the white strip\nmore precisely described ? Or were the curtains closed\nduring any part of this time ? At 10.25 p.m. it is said that\nthe strip was \" visible again,\" impljdng that there had been\nan interval during which it had not been visible. Was this\ndue to the closing of the curtains ? In many of the reports\ncpiestions such as these are raised and left unanswered, which\nproduces an unsatisfactory impression of vagueness on the\nmind of the reader. In a case where the whole value of the\nevidence depends upon accuracy of observation it is hardly\npossible to be too precise.\nI have thought it worth while to discuss this particular\ngroup of phenomena in some detail, because they are fairly\nrepresentative of the case, and the conditions under which\nthey were observed make them especially interesting. They\nprove, as it seems to me, that regurgitation cannot have\nbeen used in all instances. If therefore these phenomena\nwere fraudulently produced, the medium must have some\nother means besides regurgitation of obtaining access to\nmaterials not known to be in her possession, and whatever\nmeans were employed on this occasion may well have been\nemployed on other occasions also. I have already indicated\nthe chief difficulties in the way of supposing that the medium\ngets possession of the recpiired materials by any normal means,\nand I shall return to this question later. Meanwhile it will be\n\f358 Helen de G. Verrall. [part\nconvenient to consider what evidence there is as to the nature of\nthe substance composing what I have called the solid material-\nisations. In discussing this question I shall take into account\nonly those phenomena of which photographs are available.\nThese materialisations are of two types, flat and modelled,\nthe latter being less common. The finger seen at the sitting\nof May 16, 1913, is a notable instance of this second type\nof phenomenon. A somewhat similar finger, similarly bound\nround the second joint with a cord-like substance, was\nobserved on April 1, 1913. The two fingers, however, are not\nprecisely similar, for whereas the finger seen on May 13, 1913,\nwas almost completely extended, the finger seen on April 1,\n1913, was bent at the second joint. In this connexion it\nshould be noted that in his account of the sitting of May 16,\n1913, Dr. Bourbon says that he saw the finger make \" two or\nthree distinct bending movements.\"\nIt is difficult to form any definite hypothesis as to what the\nsubstance could be, of which these fingers are made. They\nsuggest white plaster casts, but evidently the substance is\nnot hard, like plaster, because in the photograph taken on\nMay 16, 1913, it can be seen that the outline of the finger\nhas yielded a little to the pressure of the cord, by which it\nis suspended. Possibly the effect could be produced by some\nsubstance of the nature of plasticine in the hands of a toler-\nably skilful modeller.\nA more frequent type of phenomenon consists in flat, white\n\" pseudo-hands,\" which look as though they had been cut\nout of some material having the consistency of white leather.\nThese \" pseudo-hands \" bear only a rude likeness to real\nhands and are often incomplete, having only two or three\nfingers. It is impossible not to be struck by the fact that\nthey present exactly the appearance that might be expected\nof fraudulent materialisations, and there is evidence to show\nthat, whatever their origin may be, they are used on occasion\nto perform a questionable function. In Dr. von Schrenck-\nNotzing's report on the sitting of August 11, 1911, the following\npassage occurs :\nOut of an agglomerate of the elemental substance, which kept\nshifting its position, there was formed in her lap a third clearly\n\fLXIX.] The History of Marihe Beraud. 359\nvisible flat hand [i.e. in addition to the medium's two hands which\nwere holding the curtains]. Then I also observed about thirty\ncentimetres above her head a more completely developed hand.\nWhen the phenomenon repeated itself several times and was again\nvisible above her head I took a photograph, which is of a very\nremarkable character. For in the place of her right hand is the\nflat hand which I had repeatedly seen, three fingers and the greater\npart of the back of the hand being visible. ... In the same photo-\ngraph we may observe over Eva's head a remarkable four-cornered\nobject, irregularly shaped below. We may easily suppose that the\nsubstance is supported by the medium's right hand held above\nher head. . . .\nAfter the second photograph [i.e. the photograph described\nabove] the phenomena continued. A strip of stuff about thirty\ncentimetres wide and half a yard long Avas waved at us from behind\nthe curtain, but immediately withdrawn. Finally there appeared\ncoming from the left a hand fully developed in all respects with\nfive fingers and a forearm (the medium's hand 1\n?) whilst Eva's\ntwo hands (the pseudo-hand 1\n?) lay visible on her lap. This appear-\nance made a threatening motion, remained visible for four or five\nseconds and was then withdrawn. . . . The same hand touched\nthe back of my left hand and pressed the tip of its finger against\nmy skin so that I clearly felt the nail (obviously Eva's hand 1\n). . . .\nThen the sitting ended. Considering the result of the photo-\ngraph, the cpuestion must remain open whether one of the two\nhands which lay on her knees was not in these [last] phenomena\nalso merely the appearance of a hand, so that on this assumption\nthe frankly material character of the final phenomena was pro-\nduced with the help of one of the medium's hands.\nTwo things are clear from this report. In the first place\nthere can be little doubt that the phenomena on this occasion\nwere at least partly fraudulent. The photograph shows\nthat the pseudo-hand was very cunningly placed to simulate\nthe real hand, and the curtain on that side is gripped together\n1\nThe words in round brackets are part of Dr. von Sehrenck-Notzing's\nreport; they were, I imagine, added in consequence of the disclosures made\nby the photograph, the passage without the bracketed words representing\nwhat was actually observed at the sitting. I draw this inference from Dr.\nvon Sehrenck-Notzing's words :\n\" Considering the result of the photograph.\"\n(See above.)\n\f360 Helen de G. Verrall. [part\n(probably between the medium's knee and the arm of her\nchair) in such a way that in a rather poor light it would appear\nto be gripped by the pseudo-hand. Recourse was apparently\nhad to this form of deception on at least two other occasions\n(see Materialisationsphanomene, pp. 275 and 313).\nIn the second place it is clear that until the photograph was\ndeveloped, Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing did not clearly realise the\ndeceptive nature of the phenomena. He was under the im-\npression at the time of the sitting that the medium's two hands\nwere \"visible on her lap,\"' when a third fully-developed hand was\nseen. It was this occasion that I had in view when I said that the\nstatement as to her two hands being continually under observa-\ntion could only be accepted with some reservations. She\ncould not deceive the camera, but she could apparently deceive\nthe observers. Taking all the evidence into account, and\nespecially the more stringent conditions as to the control\nof the hands which were enforced at the later sittings, I do\nnot think that this device can have been used at all frequently.\nBut the fact that it was used once at least with partial\nsuccess is damaging, as regards both the honesty of the\nmedium and the trustworthiness of the evidence concerning\nher phenomena.\nThese pseudo-hands are frequently accompanied by shape-\nless masses of what Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing calls \" the\nelemental substance.\" I have compared this substance to\nbutter-muslin, but it is of a curiously variable character and\npresents one of the most perplexing features of the case. The\nmost important advance that could be made in the evidence\nwould be to obtain further knowledge as to the nature of\nthis substance. But the investigators are seriously hampered\nby the fact that the medium strongly objects to any attempt\nto seize the materialisations or to handle them without warn-\ning, alleging,\u2014whether truly or no,\u2014that such attempts have\na damaging effect upon her health. Nevertheless, one such\nattempt has been made, at a sitting held on August 30, 1912.\nDr. Kafka thus describes the incident (Materialisations-\nphanomene, p. 345)\n:\n. . . Next a thin brownish strip appeared on the right side of her\nneck, hanging out of her dress. It was about three inches long\n\fLXIX.] The History of Marihe Bemud. 361\nand recalled in its structure a coarse porous tissue. This strip\ndid not change its appearance during the three or four seconds\nthat the light [an electric torch] was on it. At Dr. von Schrenck's\nrequest I snatched at the substance ; the medium cried out in\nprotest and made violent movements of her whole body and\nespecially of her neck, so that I seized nothing. I also felt no\nmoisture under my hand.\nThis incident is interesting as far as it goes, but it is far\nfrom being conclusive. The materialisation seen on this\noccasion was very small, and, as Dr. Kafka himself suggests,\nthe violent movements of the medium might easily have\nprevented him from laying his hand on it. The failure of a\nsimilar attempt to seize a large mass of substance would have\nafforded much better evidence of supernormality. I think\nthat the efforts of those who are investigating these pheno-\nmena should now be mainly directed to seizing a portion of\nthis substance, or at least to demonstrating, far more clearly\nthan has been done yet, that it cannot be seized. The ex-\nperiment made on August 30, 1912, did not apparently do\nthe medium any permanent injury. Could not this experi-\nment be repeated at intervals, especially at moments when\na large mass of substance is visible ?\nOf all the phenomena associated with Eva C. the most\nsensational are the more or less realistic representations of\nhuman heads, which appear at the sittings, some being flat,\nothers modelled in relief. In some cases it is difficult to be\nsure whether the head is flat or modelled, but on several\noccasions photographs were taken simultaneously from differ-\nent positions, and the proportions of the materialised object\nthus demonstrated. (See Materialisationsphanomene, pp. 283 ff.\nand 311 ff.\n1\n) The heads are never completely modelled ;\nthey are masks in bas-relief, and the modelling shows as a\nrule very little technical skill. The features are often dis-\ntorted, especially the nose. The most realistic of these modelled\nfaces is the one which appeared at the sitting of November\n1\nBy the courtesy of Dr. von Schrenek-Notzinu: I have also had the oppor-\ntunity of examining some stereoscopic photographs, in which the dimensions\nof these heads can be more clearly seen.\n\f362 Helen de G. Verrall. [part\n22, 1911 (Materialisationsphdnomene, p. 216). Even here\nthere is distortion, but rather as though a good model had\nbeen roughly used and knocked out of shape.\nThe flat heads, on the other hand, display considerable\nskill in draughtsmanship ; as Dr. vow Schrenck points out\nhimself, they present the appearance of \" artistic \" productions,\ndrawn or painted on some thin pliant material, such as silk\nor linen. In at least one instance (the Monna Lisa of Material-\nisationsphxinomene, p. 239 1\n) the lighting of the medium's\nface is inconsistent with the lighting of the materialised head,\nproving that the photograph shows us in one case the actual\nshadows caused by the magnesium flash by which it was taken,\nand in the other only a representation of shadows already\nexisting as an integral part of the \" materialisation.\" Many\nof the heads show clear traces of having been creased or\nfolded, and in some cases the edges are torn.\nThese heads are chiefly interesting as affording evidence\nof a surprising and most suspicious nature as to the source\nfrom which some of them were derived. A photograph taken\nat the sitting of November 27, 1912 (Materialisationsphano-\nmene, p. 367) shows the medium with a mass of some white\nsubstance fastened to one side of her face. On the back of\nthis substance, as shown by a simultaneous photograph taken\nfrom inside the cabinet, there appear the letters M I R 0 in\nlar^e capitals. The explanation of this curious phenomenon\ngiven by the medium at the next sitting is of the flimsiest.\nOn the other hand, in a series of articles published in January\nand February, 1914, in the Psychic Magazine,2\nit is pointed out\nthat these capital letters bear a very close resemblance to the\nlettering on the cover of the French illustrated paper Le Miroir,\nand that some of the heads seen at Eva's sittings are obviously\nderived from illustrations which have been published on the\nfront page of Le Miroir. Two clear instances of this may\nbe seen on pp. 386 and 402 of Materialisationsphdnomene.\nWith the first of these two photographs, taken at the sitting\nof January 19, 1913, may be compared the portrait of Presi-\n1\nAn enlarged and much clearer reproduction of this photograph appears\nin Madame Bisson's book Les Phenomenes dits de Materialisation, p. 101.\n2\nA periodical which, in spite of its English title, is French, and published\nin Paris.\n\fLXIX.] The History of Marthe Beraud. 363\ndent Wilson, published in Le Miroir on November 17, 1912,\nand with the second, taken at the sitting of March 6, 1913,\nmay be compared the portrait of President Poincare, published\nin Le Miroir on April 21, 1912. In both cases the features\nhave been to some extent altered or blotted out, but there\ncan be no reasonable doubt (nor indeed is it denied by\nDr. von Schrenck-Notzing 1\n) that these '\"materialisations\"\nare in some way derived from the Miroir portraits. On the\nother hand a careful comparison of details makes it clear\nthat at least in some cases the \" materialisations \" do not\nconsist of the actual paper sheets torn from Le Miroir, because\nthere are slight discrepancies which no amount of \" touching-\nup \" will explain. (For the details of this evidence, which\nit is impossible to give here, see Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing's\nDer Kampf um die Materialisationsphanomene.) The heads\nat the sittings present the appearance of a rough tracing or\ncopy of the Miroir portraits, deliberately botched in various\nways.\nDr. von Schrenck-Notzing brings forward evidence to show\nthat there are also discrepancies between the capital letters\nobserved on November 27, 1912, and the Miroir title ; but\nthe evidence on this point does not seem to me conclusive, if\nallowances are made for the possible effect of perspective, slight\ncrumpling of the paper, etc. Considering that the letters are\non the back of the \" materialisation,\" i.e. they were not\nvisible to the observers, but only appeared in a photograph\ntaken from inside the cabinet, it is natural to suppose, if we\nassume fraud, that they were there by an oversight on the\npart of the medium, and were not, so to speak, intended for\nexhibition.\nTo explain these phenomena Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing\nputs forward the theory of \" ideoplasma.\" These heads are\n\" materialised dream-images,\" \" ephemeral, externalised and\nin some cases recognisable precipitates from the medium's\npsychical impressions and recollections.\" The medium, accord-\n1\nSee Der Kampf um die Materialisationsphanomene, p. 114: \"It may be\nobjected that the cumulative force of these pieces of evidence [i.e. the various\npoints of resemblance between the \" materialisations \" and the Miroir\npictures], corroborating one another, is too great to be explained by pure\nchance-coincidence ; an opinion in which I must concur.\"\n\f364 Helen cle G. Verrall. [part\ning to this theory, has seen the Miroir portraits and out of\nthe impression which they have left upon her mind she is able,\nby some strange creative process, to make material repro-\nductions of her thoughts, which, when the creative force\nceases to work, are reabsorbed into her body. It is useless\nperhaps to speculate as to how this obscure ideoplastic faculty\nmight be expected to act, but it is surely remarkable that\nthe medium's \" materialised dream image \" should adorn\nPresident Wilson with a black eye and an alien moustache,\nwhilst reproducing almost exactly the pattern of his\ntie !\nThe burden of proof in regard to this ideoplastic theory,\nas in regard to all supernormal theories, is upon those\nwho uphold it, and obviously a very broad basis of evi-\ndence will be required. But the evidence put forward\nby Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing is almost entirely negative :\nthe medium could not have had the necessary materials in\nher possession ; she could not have manipulated them in\nthe necessary way (owing to the close watch kept upon her\nhands) ; the observed effects could not be produced by any\nof the normal processes, which the medium might be sup-\nposed to employ. That there is considerable force in Dr.\nvon Schrenck-Notzing's contentions, no careful reader of his\nbook will deny, but he has against him a dead weight of\nprobability which is hard to move.\nThe case is very complex, and discussion of its various\nfeatures might be indefinitely prolonged. But since the object\nof this review is to set before the reader, so far as is possible,\nan estimate of the evidence as a whole, I think that I shall best\nserve that object if I now briefly summarise what seem to\nme the chief points for and against the genuineness of the\nphenomena, and finally state the general conclusions to which\nthe evidence seems to point.\nThe Case against the Phenomena.\n(1) Some of the heads observed during the sittings have\nbeen traced to a French illustrated paper, Le Miroir ; these\nheads present the appearance of being drawn in black upon\nwhite paper or linen ;\nupon two occasions a \" rustling as of\nsoft paper \" was heard just before and just after the appear-\n\fi.x ix.\n;\nThe History of Marthe Beraud. 365\nance of a head (see Materialisationsphanomene, pp. 366 and\n372). On one occasion the letters MIRO appeared, in a type\nclosely resembling that which is used on the title sheet of\nLe Miroir.\n(2) Except on one occasion no determined effort has been\nmade to obtain any direct positive evidence as to the nature\nof the substance of which these heads and similar phenomena\nconsist. This is explained by saying that attempts to obtain\nsuch evidence are injurious to the medium, but the chief\nauthority for this statement is the medium herself, who, if\nher phenomena are fraudulent, has an obvious interest in\nmaking it.\n(3) There is some evidence of attempted fraud on the part\nof the medium by the substitution of a faked hand for her\nown, which was thereby left free to play various tricks upon\nthe observers. This fact, taken in conjunction with the\nmedium's previous record, must awaken grave suspicions of\nher honesty.\n(4) The sittings take place in a dimly-lighted room. The\nmedium sits in a cabinet which is not lighted from within ;\nthe cabinet is closed in front by two curtains, which are usually\nunder the medium's control. She can open or close them at\nher own pleasure. In many cases the curtains were opened\nonly when the \" materialisation \" was fully \" developed,\"\nand closed again immediately afterwards. These conditions\nobviously lend themselves to the manipulation of fraudulently\nprepared materials.\n(5) It has been suggested that the medium possesses the\nfaculty of regurgitation and that she swallows rolls of paper,\nmuslin, etc., which she uses to produce the so-called material-\nisations. This theory is supported by various observations\nwhich have been made as to the nature of the materialisa-\ntions and the conditions under which they are produced,\nespecially by the fact that they are frequently seen issuing\nfrom the medium's mouth.\nThe Case for the Phenomena.\n(1) It is difficult to see by what normal process the medium\ncould have prepared the various objects which have been\nseen at the sittings, especially those which are modelled in\n\f366 Helen de G. Verrall. [part\nrelief. She has never been observed to make any suspicious\npurchases, nor have any suspicious materials been found in\nher possession.\n(2) A deliberate attempt was made on one occasion to\nsecure a piece of the materialised substance, but the attempt\nfailed. It is suggested that the failure, was due to the abnormal\nnature of the substance, which had been reabsorbed into the\nmedium's body. Evidence of this kind might be of great\nvalue if it could be strengthened by repetition, but one cannot\nattach much importance to a single incident.\n(3) At the later sittings the medium held the curtains with\nher hands all the time. Even when the curtains were closed\npart of her hands was visible. The observation of the hands\nwas thereby made easier and the medium had proportion-\nately less opportunity of using them for the production of\nphenomena. There seems no doubt that phenomena are\nfrequently produced without the use of the hands.\n(4) At a sitting held on September 11, 1912, the curtains\nremained open throughout and phenomena of an interesting\nand remarkable character were nevertheless obtained. This\nis an important sitting, to which I shall refer again.\n(5) The regurgitation theory will not cover the whole case,\nbecause on three occasions (see above, pp. 351 ff.) the medium's\nhead was enveloped in a veil and \" materialisations \" were\nnevertheless obtained outside the veil. Moreover, at a sitting\nheld on November 26, 1913, with the express purpose of\ntesting this theory, the medium was given an emetic immedi-\nately after the sitting and the contents of the stomach were\nanalysed, but nothing suspicious was found. The circum-\nstances are thus described by Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing (see\nDer Kampf um die Materialisationsphanomene, pp. 9 ff.) :\nThe curtains were open when the phenomena began.\nBetween 9 and 9.10 p.m. a white substance issued with a flowing\nmotion from the medium's mouth without any assistance from\nher hands or knees. . . . The length of the strip was about fifty\ncentimetres, its width about twenty centimetres. It laid itself\nupon the breast of her dress, broadened out and formed a white\nhead-like disc, of life size and with the profile to the right. Even\nafter the magnesium flash (used for the purpose of taking a photo-\n\fLXIX.] The History of Marthe Beraud. 367\ngraph) the curtain remained wide open. At the same moment\nI turned an electric torch upon the image, which now formed a\nfolded strip and went slowly back into the medium's mouth, which\nremained visible till the close of the sitting, 9.20 p.m.\nThe emetic was administered at once and took effect at\n9.30 p.m. The contents of the stomach, which were analysed,\nshowed no trace of anything but fragments of partly digested\nfood. The medium's mouth was examined both before and\nafter the sitting, so that it seems clear that the substance\nseen on this occasion came from her throat or stomach and\nwas of a nature to be rapidly assimilated. None of the artificial\nproducts which it has been suggested that she may use, e.g.\npaper, silk, linen, etc., answer to this description, nor, judging\nby the appearance of the phenomenon on this occasion, does\nit seem to me necessary to suppose that any material of that\nkind was used. There is no question here of a clearly-\ndefined \" portrait head \" but only of a \" head-like disc.\"\nI hesitate to put forward a theory which requires medical\nknowledge for its support, but it seems to me worth consider-\ning whether the case might not be explained by sup-\nposing that the medium is possessed of some abnormal power\nof bodily secretion (mcluding probably the power of re-\ngurgitation), which she supplements by fraud. On this\nhypothesis I should say, roughly speaking, that whilst the\nmore definite phenomena, heads, hands, etc., are fraudulent,\nthe phenomenon witnessed at the sitting just described and\nthe many similar phenomena witnessed on other occasions\nare to be explained by this supposed power of secretion.\nThere is, in fact, a good deal of evidence suggesting that the\nmedium is able to secrete substances of various kinds from her\nbody in an abnormal way. In particular, I would refer the\nreader to the sitting of September 11, 1912 (Materialisations-\nphiinomene, pp. 339 ff.). Reports of the phenomena witnessed\nat this sitting (too long to quote here) are given not only\nby Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing, but also by Dr. Kafka and\nCount Pappenheim. Dr. Kafka's report is especially inter-\nresting, and suggests that the secretion issued not only from\nthe medium's mouth, but also from her breasts. Reports of\nsecretions from the navel and other parts of the body are\n2a\n\f368 Helen cle G. Verrall. [part\ngiven by Madame Bisson (see MaterialisationspTianomene, pp.\n192, 220 ff), the medium being on these occasions completely\nnaked. It is unfortunate that, as regards the evidence for\nthese interesting and remarkable phenomena, we should be\ndependent on the report of a single observer. For obvious\nreasons the unsupported testimony of any one person can\nnever be accepted without reservation, and moreover Madame\nBisson, being a personal friend of the medium, and convinced\nof the genuineness of her phenomena, cannot be expected to\nregard them from an entirely critical and detached point of\nview.\nIn many cases we may suppose that the secretion is of a\nfluid and foam-like character ; in others (as e.g. the sitting of\nNovember 26, 1913, see above, p. 366) we must assume that it\nmay become partially solidified. I am aware that this theory\nis open to serious objections and I put it forward very tenta-\ntively. It has at least the merit that it would explain some\nof the most perplexing features of the case, without straining\nour credulity to the extent to which it must be strained, if we\nare to accept the supposed \" ideoplastic \" reproductions from\nthe illustrated press.\nThere is very little positive evidence of fraud in regard\nto Eva C.'s phenomena (I have referred above to the occasional\nsubstitution of pseudo-hands) ;\nnevertheless, as regards the\nMiroir portraits and other kindred phenomena, the balance\nof probability appears to be on the side of fraud, although\nI must admit that I am quite unable to put forward\nany coherent theory as to the particular method or methods\nemployed. But on the other hand, if we suppose that the\nwhole case is purely fraudulent, we should be forced, as it\nseems to me, to make all the following assumptions :\n(a) that the phenomena are ill observed and carelessly\nreported ;\n(b) that the medium possesses the faculty of regurgitation ;\n(c) that she was able on several occasions to elude the\npreliminary search and conceal materials of various kinds,\neither in the cabinet or on her person ;\nand, almost certainly,\n(d) that she had in some cases a confederate, at least in the\npreparation of the materials, if not in the actual production\nof the phenomena.\n\fLXIX.] The History of Martlie Beraud. 369\nI have tried to indicate in a general way with what degree\nof probability these various assumptions may be made. But\nno review can enable any reader to form an independent judg-\nment of the case ; for this a detailed study of the published\nreports, or personal observation of the phenomena, would be\nrequired.\nPersonally I incline to the opinion that there is evidence in\nthis case of some abnormal faculty, round which have gathered\nfraudulent accretions of various kinds. I am aware that the\ntheory of physical secretion which I have put forward above\nneeds personal observation to substantiate it and may be\nwholly inadequate to explain the facts. I put it forward, as\nI have said, for consideration, because, after reading Dr. von\nSchrenck's report, I find myself in great perplexity,\u2014unable\nto conclude either that the phenomena are wholly fraudulent,\nor that he has proved his case for the ideoplastic theory.\nBefore a solution of the problem can be reached, further\ninvestigation will be necessary under the most stringent\nconditions which the medium can be induced to accept. In-\ndeed, unless she will accept more stringent conditions\nthan have hitherto been imposed, I doubt whether any\nsolution is possible. Meanwhile, a debt of gratitude is\nowing to Madame Bisson and to Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing\nfor the patience and industry which they have devoted to\na most laborious task.\n\f370 Sidney Wilkinson, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P. [part\nSPECIAL MEDICAL SUPPLEMENT.\nVIII.\nRECENT EXPERIENCE IN HYPNOTIC PRACTICE.\nBy Sidney Wilkinson, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P.\n(Hon. Physician to the Liverpool Psycho-Therapeutic Clinic,\nMember of the Psycho-Medical Society).\nDuring 23 years in which I have employed hypnosis in medical\npractice, I have had experience of all classes of cases, and it\nseems to me amazing that medical men have such a power at\ntheir disposal which they never employ, and withal one that\nis so easy to use.\nTake, for instance, a case of pneumonia with all the accom-\npaniments of parched mouth, dry skin, sleeplessness, and pain.\nI have seen patients respond almost immediately to the\nsuggestion of sleep, waking at regular intervals as instructed,\nto take their supplies of nourishment and medicine for which\nan artificial desire has been induced. They have looked for-\nward to the nightly visits to receive suggestions, with a\nconfidence unequalled in any other form of treatment. By\nthe same means pain has been relieved and the skin moistened.\nWe are acquainted also with the benefits bestowed for the\nrelief of drink and drug habits, neuralgia, asthma, obsessions,\nstammering, painful self-consciousness, hysteria, and a hundred\nother maladies in which suggestions are applicable.\nAs a conservation of work, hypnosis has been used in institu-\ntions for mental cases, where attentive rapport has been\nestablished between patient and attendant, so that on the\nsmallest movement of the patient during sleep, the attendant\nquicldy awakes, though unaffected by noises of a much more\ndisturbing nature.\n\flxix.] Rece?it Experience in Hypnotic Practice. 371\nI had a somewhat amusing experience on these lines, in a\nlady patient who suffered from nervousness and insomnia.\nI suggested ability to sleep soundly, but in order that a\nyoung and somewhat delicate child might not suffer from\ninattention, I included a protective suggestion of rapport, that\nwhilst sleeping soundly through aU other movements and\nnoises, she would be alert to any movement that the child\nmight make. The night following was broken by the boy\ndeveloping an attack of croup, and true to the letter of my\ninstructions, the mother awoke, but only to fulfil the duty\nof rousing her husband, and thereafter being content, she\nturned over and slept soundly through the remainder of the\nnight.\nIn spite of the evidence in favour of the employment of\npsycho-therapeutic methods in selected cases, and even in\nsome degree for many organic diseases, it still seems to be\nnecessary to offer some sort of apology for its employment.\nIt does not occur to us to justify the use of radiography,\nelectricity, and other forms of treatment that are far newer.\nIs it because psychic treatment is produced by an agency\nthat cannot be seen, and felt, and measured ? Yet its results\nare not infrequently characterised by extreme brilliancy.\nThere is no doubt, however, that the old conservatism is\nrapidly dying down, and that medical men, though they may\nbe slow to see that a case is a suitable one, and try every other\nmeans first, are nevertheless recommending patients in in-\ncreasing numbers, and teachers are more and more acknowledg-\ning the merits of psychic healing in their clinics. The day is\nrapidly dawning when hospitals will not be considered com-\nplete without psycho-therapeutic specialists upon their staff.\nI invite your attention to some interesting points occurring\nin three or four of my patients during treatment, but I would\nlike it to be clearly realised that though I made some simple\ntests in the cases recorded, these are special instances, and that\nthey have been done with the patients' full consent and\nknowledge. They are a few patients chosen from many, and\nit must not be inferred that a custom is made of thus experi-\nmenting. Patients must be treated, not tested, and this is a\nprinciple that I invariably adopt, for I am convinced that\nthere would be no greater deterrent to patients accepting\n\f372 Sidney Wilkinson, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P. [part\ntreatment than the thought that they were destined to play\na part in some entertainment.\nThe first case I shall record, I will refer to as E. P., a man of\n47 years, whose employment was amongst horses.\nI was asked to see him as a hospital patient.\nAs might be expected from his calling, he was a rugged type\nof man, and scarcely one who might be expected to develop\nneurotic symptoms, and less so, since there was no thought of\ncompensation to accentuate his malady.\nTwo years prior to my seeing him he was thrown from a\nhorse whilst jumping a hedge, and lay for some time untended\nin the ditch. He had some indefinite injury to the head, and\npains in the hip which were probably of a rheumatic character\nfrom damp and exposure. Instead of improving, his symp-\ntoms increased, and perhaps the more because, as a well-known\nservant, he was frequently visited and sympathised with by\nhis master's friends.\nFinally he drifted into hospital, where he had been an inmate\nfor two months before I was asked by the physician in attend-\nance to see him, as the conclusion had been arrived at that his\npains were chiefly of a functional nature. During all this\ntime he had been confined to bed.\nMy interviews with him were in the X-ray room, to which\nhe was carried in a lifting chair, and whilst still seated in the\nchair and with a ruby, cell-charging lamp for illumination, an\nattempt was made to induce hypnosis. This was successful\nto a deep degree, on the first trial, and after my suggestions\nwere concluded, he was carried back still asleep, with instruc-\ntions not to awake until the nurse came round to him with\nhis dinner. He was much tickled on awaking to find himself\nback in bed with no memory of the transition.\nNext day the process was repeated, with this variation, that\nhe was now informed that he could walk back to the ward\nwith light assistance. In this he was quite successful, negotia-\nting on the way two nights of steps. This was the first time\nin two years that he had been upon his feet. His fellow\npatients exhibited keen interest in this experiment.\nAlthough success had thus far met our efforts, the pain had\nnot greatly abated, and I wondered if I could expedite recovery\n\flxix.] Recent Experience in Hypnotic Practice. 373\nby temporarily blotting out from consciousness the memory of\nthe accident and attendant effects.\nTo bring about this end I created a dissociation by sugges-\ntion, and brought about a change of personality in which E. P.,\nthe man who had sustained injury and had lived in the hospital\nas a patient, had no part. The proposal was that he should\nbecome John Jones, who was engaged as a hospital attendant,\nwho had no knowledge of E. P. and his accident. He con-\ntinued to occupy the same bed, and understood that he was\nthus situated the better to assist in the ward duties. Mean-\nwhile his case card was removed and letters bearing his rightful\nname were withheld. It was understood by all concerned\nthat he was to be addressed as Jones, and work was to be\nfound for him.\nAll went well for about six hours, and he worked quite indus-\ntriously, but at five o'clock the same evening, when the house\nsurgeon addressed him as Jones, he said :\n\" You have been\nhaving a fine game with me ; I know who I am now.\" At\nthe same time he continued to assist in the ward work,\nthough it was apparent that he limped, and he still complained\nof pain.\nOn the following morning I repeated my suggestions of\naltered personality, and again he responded. Realising that\nhe returned to normal at 5 p.m. on the previous day, I\nrang up the hospital at that hour and had the man brought\nto the telephone, when I at once addressed him as Jones. The\nruse was quite successful, and the response as unexpected.\nAsked how he was doing in his new place, he assured me\nthat he was all right, but added, \" What are you going to\ngive me for this job ?\n\" I satisfied him on the point, and he\nthen complained of pain in his hip as though he was then\nexperiencing it for the first time, and offered as a satisfac-\ntory explanation that it was caused by looking after two\npneumonia patients, whom he described as \" them two\nlunatics,\" who had kept him awake all night. This was a\nself-imposed task, and was evidently a reason invented to\naccount for what he believed to be a new pain.\nAs is well known, patients frequently invent reasons in this\nmanner to account for phenomena which they cannot other-\nwise explain.\n\f374 Sidney Wilkinson, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P. [part\nHe was at this time wearing an old dressing-gown, and fear-\ning that it might prove suggestive of invalidism to him, I told\nhim that I wished him to wear a white coat, whilst on duty,\nlike those worn by the house doctors. For this he demanded\nextra payment. His cupidity was growing apace. I kept him\nin this state for three days, at the expiration of which time I\nwas obliged to resynthetise the dissociation for the peace of\nthe administration. He had become so strict in his zealous\nattendance upon the pneumonia patients, that no one was\npermitted to speak above a whisper for fear of waking them,\nand a nurse was severely reprimanded for sneezing. So for\nthe smooth working of the ward Jones had to become E. P.\nonce more, and was allowed to receive letters and friends, but\nforgetfulness of the accident was still suggested.\nA rapid diminution of pain ensued, walking became more\ncertain and easy, and in fourteen days he was discharged from\nhospital, and during the next two weeks, prior to returning to\nwork, he several times walked two miles from his home to\nvisit me. In one month from the commencement of treat-\nment he returned to a former employment, which consisted in\nbreaking-in horses.\nOn the last occasion upon which I saw him, he complained\nof a blank period in his memory that had been produced since\nhe had been under me. This was the state that I had pur-\nposely left when I restored him to his normal personality, so\nthat his recovery might not be retarded by disadvantageous\nrecollections. Now that the end had been gained, I released\nthis inhibition and placed him at his ease.\nThere was in this case a psychic trauma as well as the somatic\none, the symptoms of the latter continuing to be reproduced as\nreverberations. No doubt I should have eventually succeeded\nin arriving at a satisfactory termination of the case by the\nuse of simple suggestions, but I am satisfied that by causing\na displacement of memory I was able to eliminate the pain\nmore effectually, so that exercise might be encouraged with\nits concomitant improvements in circulation and muscular\ndevelopment, both of which were vital for recovery.\nThe next case I will refer to as Miss A., a dressmaker,\naged 28.\n\flxix.] Recent Experience in Hypnotic Practice. 375\nIt was one of conversion hysteria, the chief symptoms of\nwhich were spasmodic wry neck and spinal curvature, the\nmuscular contractions being of a very coarse and distressing\nnature. Here, again, the duration was two years, with abso-\nlute confinement to bed in the last four months. Feeding and\nother attentions were rendered very difficult on account of\nthe incessant movements of the head and shoulders, and a\ngood deal of pain was experienced from the same cause.\nFig. 1, Plate A, shows how severe was the torticollis, but\nfails to show it at its worst, for with each movement the head\nwas jerked still lower on to the shoulder. Life was a misery in\nspite of the unremitting endeavours of her medical attendant.\nTreatment was commenced on April 16, 1912, and on the\nfollowing day the first photograph was taken, at the patient's\nhome. She was barely able to stand for the few moments\nnecessary for this procedure, and the photograph was practically\nan instantaneous one.\nOn a first attempt, I was fortunately able to induce hypnosis\nto the fourth degree, and there were in all twenty-eight treat-\nments, though after six or seven sessions the patient was able\nto go out and take short walks.\nOn the second day I made an attempt to resurrect the\ncausative effect, and her mother being present, I induced a\ndeep stage of hypnosis, and placed a pencil in her hand and a\nsheet of paper before her, and I instructed her to write answers\nto my questions, and for a facsimile of this writing the reader\nmust refer to Plate A, Fig. 3.\nIn answer to my first enquiry, viz. what circumstance she\nassociated with her first symptoms, she wrote \" Fright.\"\nNext, I asked who frightened her, and she wrote \" Man.\"\n\" When ?\n\" \" Night, May, 1910.\" \" How did he frighten\nyou ?\n\" \" Tried to take my life.\" \" In what way ?\n\"\n\" Poison.\"\nI showed her this paper on awaking, and she expressed great\nrelief. She felt freed from a burden, only the skeleton of\nwhich she remembered, and the details of which she had con-\nfided to no one, her mother not excepted. Free conversation\nwas invited and various memories recalled.\nIt was, of course, a love affair, and the man showing mental\nsymptoms the engagement was abandoned, and he tried to\n\f376 Sidney Wilkinson, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P. [part\ntake revenge by an actual attempt upon her life, and by\nother forms of persecution, all of which had been zealously\nkept secret.\nThis is a case that would doubtless have benefited by Freud's\nmethod of psycho-analysis, but fortunately I was able to obtain\nall the associations I needed by the quicker route, because she\nproved a good hypnotic subject.\nSo far as the case was concerned, my work was practically\nended, and it only remained for me to continue my suggestions\nfor a time, and to give some general directions for exercises\ndesigned to cure the scoliosis, in order to obtain the result as\nseen in Fig. 2, Plate A.\nFrom the point of interest to this Society, however, the case\nis still of value.\nWishing to test the power of the unfettered sub-conscious\nmind to recall very early events, I hypnotised Miss A. and\nasked her to tell me of one of her earliest recollections. She\nrecalled a circumstance which she told me occurred at the age\nof three years. She remembered a scene at a bridge under\nwhich a large volume of water flowed, and which she was\nafraid to cross. Her mother corroborated this, and supplied\nother details, such as the child's screams and the people who\nwere attracted thereby.\nI urged her to try further back, and I asked her what she\ncould recall in connection with her second birthday. I had\nno reason for asking for this particular day, except that\na birth date is a prominent day in a child's life, one that\ncould be more easily remembered than any other date.\nAfter naming this day, I realised that the second birthday\nmight be rather ambiguous, and might as easily refer to the first\nanniversary as the second, according to whether the actual birth-\nday was included in the count or not, so I made the question\nspecific by adding, the birthday when you were two years old.\nShe informed me at once that she was ill. Her mother\nsubsequently recalled this fact. Giving her a pencil and\npaper, I asked her to draw a square to represent the sick\nroom, and to place initials corresponding to fireplace, window,\ndoor and cot (Fig. 4, Plate A). The result is not a work of\nart, for the eyes were closed and the finish of the square did\nnot correspond with the commencement.\n\flxix.] Recent Experience in Hypnotic Practice. 377\nIf I had thought at that time that I was likely to publish the\ncase, I should have allowed the girl to open the eyes, and make\na more finished sketch, but still this was not a test of drawing\nability, but of memory, the details of which were confirmed\nagain by the mother. In the waking state the girl had no\nmemory of these events, and had even no knowledge of the\nhouse she had then lived in.\nI have since ascertained from Dr. Francis Scott that he had a\ncase where memory was pushed back to the third month, and\na pattern of the wall paper was sketched and afterwards veri-\nfied to be correct. I have also met a girl in her early teens who\ncan remember an incident in her first year, in her waking state.\nI nevertheless cite this for what it is worth, with the comment\nthat there is a difference between the early memory of a child\nwho has just entered her teens, and that of a young woman in\nher twenty-ninth year.\nI next experimented Avith her for the post-hypnotic fulfilment\nof a suggestion to a specified number of minutes.\nOn June 14 (1912), at 11.45, I induced hypnosis, and sug-\ngested that she should come to my house in 4455 minutes.\nShe had never been tried with a time test, nor had she been\nto my house, though she was acquainted with the ferry-boats\nby which she travelled, and she knew what time to allow\nbetween the ferry and the Square in which I live.\nThe journey involved the following modes of transit. A walk\nto a tram-car occupying about fifteen minutes, tram ten to\nfifteen minutes, ferry-boat to Liverpool, change of steamers,\nand ferry-boat to Birkenhead, and finally a walk of five\nminutes' duration. The journey was therefore somewhat com-\nplicated, but nevertheless she was on my doorstep as the clock\nwas striking two on June 17th, i.e., exactly in 4455 minutes.\nI presume there must have been an element of good luck in\narriving exactly to the minute, since it would be impossible to\njudge the precise time that it would take to complete the\njourney. She must have been to a great degree dependent\nupon the timing of the steamers, and her only chance of\nlingering or making up time would be in the last five minutes'\nwalk to my house. Her sister accompanied her, and they\nboth stated that there was no special effort made to keep a\nscheduled time. She had a feeling that she must come about\n\f378 Sidney Wilkinson, M.R.C.8., L.R.C.P. [part\nthat time, without having a specified hour in her mind. It\nseemed more a question of \" beating time \" than judging by\na clock.\nThe question will naturally arise, was the command given in\nthe presence of any one who would instruct and prompt her ?\nThe mother was present at the time of the suggestion, but\nI had the assurance of both that no assistance was given, that\nnothing whatever was told the girl on waking. The mother\nwas as interested in the experiment as I was, and, moreover,\nshe is incapable of making a calculation in minutes which run\ninto thousands, as is also the girl herself. The girl only\nknew at the completion of the test that she had come to me\nin response to a suggestion. No test had been given pre-\nviously to guide her.\nIn this experiment I had purposely given a number of\nminutes which I had previously estimated would mature at a\ntime when I would be at home to receive her, but in the next\nexperiment I named the minutes at random.\nHaving hypnotised her in my Liverpool consulting room,\non July 1st, 1912, I read a paragraph from a book which lay\nupon my table :\n\u2014\n\" An old and loyal patient consulted me one morning. She\ncomplained of being run down and languid, and of troublesome\nindigestion. I prescribed a medicine and a course of treatment\nwhich I assured her would put her right.\"\nI read it a second time, and told her that in 4910 minutes, no\nmatter what might be occupying her attention at the time, she\nwould write it down in full and then make a note of the time.\nTo enable her to do this, I instructed her to carry a pencil\nand a piece of paper with her. I awoke her, and after she\nhad left I made a calculation and found that the suggestion\nwould fall due on the fourth night at 3.50. The sister was\npresent on this occasion, but assures me that she gave no\nassistance, and, moreover, did not know herself when the\ncalculation would work out.\nOn the fifth day the patient duly called upon me, bringing\nthe slip of paper with the sentence written out almost word\nfor word, and endorsed 2.20 a.m. The only variation in the\nwording is as follows : for \" She complained of being run\ndown and languid, and of troublesome indigestion,\" she had\n\fx,xix.] Recent Experience in Hypnotic Practice. 379\nwritten, \" She complained of feeling tired, languid, and suffer-\ning from indigestion.\"\nI will undertake to say that not one reader can repeat the\nfirst ten words of this sentence at this juncture, yet after four\nand a half days the paragraph on a first attempt is almost\ncorrect throughout. It will be observed that there is an\nerror of 90 minutes between the estimated time and the actual\ncompletion of 4910 minutes. The experiment is wonderful\nenough as it stands, but it must be explained that the girl\nhad no clock in her bedroom, and the question arises whether\nthe sub-conscious reckoning was at fault, or the guess which\nthe waking mind made of the time of carrying out the\nsuggestion.\nFrom the former experience I lean to the latter theory.\nI questioned Miss A. and her sister, who sleeps with her, as\nto what occurred on that night. It appears that on retiring\nto bed that evening Miss A. took to bed with her the piece of\npaper and a pencil, it being the first time she had taken this\nprecaution to provide a pencil, in the preceding four days,\nthough she did not know why she did this. Both were\nsoundly asleep, when the sister was awakened by Miss A.\nsitting up, and exhibiting a strange and confused demeanour.\nShe complained of feeling cold and faint, but rose from bed,\nand in the dark fulfilled her task, when she at once became more\ncomfortable, returned to bed and slept.\nThe next case is interesting as showing that when I started\na train of thoughts, the movements that subsequently followed\nwere self-devised in accordance with the subject's foreknow-\nledge of what is usual under the circumstances.\nThe patient was a boy aged 1 1 years. He had been frightened\nby an infuriated bullock charging him, and for many months\nhe had been afflicted with epileptiform convulsions of daily\noccurrence, in some of which the parents feared a fatal issue.\nTwo or three sittings completely eradicated them.\nOne day, as he lay asleep, I put the suggestion to him that\nhe was a cat. For some time he made no move, and did not\nseem to know what was expected of him, but when I explained\nthat cats sat by the fire and washed themselves, he jumped\ndown off the couch and proceeded to carry these occupations\n\f380 Sidney Wilkinson, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P. [part\ninto effect, and thereafter he invented new pastimes for him-\nself. He purred and rubbed himself against my leg. He\nsought for mice in the dark corners of the room, played with\ncotton reels under the table, growled over small articles thrown\nto him as mice, pawing them in quite a characteristic manner.\nIf told that a dog had entered the room, he arched his back\nand stiffened his muscles. At the call of \"puss,\" he followed\nme about the house, and descended the stairs on all fours in a\nperfectly correct style. If awakened in any of these attitudes,\nhe appeared embarrassed, but had no memory of his actions.\nAfter a few such experiments I desisted, as I am of the\nopinion that such tests pushed too far are not in the best\ninterests of the patient.\nMr. H., an organ builder, age about 48, came under my care\nlast year on account of profound neurasthenia.\nBeing desirous of testing the depth of his hypnosis, I\nsuggested a post-hypnotic inability to step over a tape which\nI had placed across the floor. On waking, he made two\nattempts to do this and failed. He thereupon sat down on\nthe chair against which one end of the tape was placed, with\nhis legs bent very awkwardly to that side of the tape on\nwhich he had been standing. Suddenly he gave a savage\nside kick to remove the obstruction, saying at the same time,\n\" This thing annoys me.\" Thereafter he was able to walk\nthrough the gap he had effected.\nSeeing his evident annoyance, I did not repeat this test, but\ntried a simpler one on his next visit. Looking around my\nroom for a suggestion to make, and having in mind his pro-\nfession, I was struck with the analogy which my desk bore to\nan organ. It is a roll top desk with columns of drawers down\nthe sides, and on top of the desk stands a three-tier elastic\nbookcase. I suggested that when awake he would be im-\npressed by the analogy, seeing in the tall lines of books a\nsimilarity to organ pipes, in the writing surface the keyboard,\nin the drawers at the sides, stops, and the pedal space\nunderneath.\nAfter awaking he approached the desk and examined the\nwhole thing minutely, then said how irresistibly it reminded\nhim of his work, indicated, with an upward sweep of his hand,\n\flxix.] Recent Experience in Hypnotic Practice. 381\nthe likeness of the books to pipes, ran his fingers over the\ntable top, and looked below for the pedals, which, however,\nwere not represented, the space merely indicating them.\nFinally he opened the drawers down the side as though he\nwas on the point of making a comparison, then his better\nknowledge coming to his rescue, he shut them with a vicious\nsnap, and said, \" You have got the stops in the wrong place ;\nthey should be here,\" and opened a little drawer inside the\nroll top.\nI had made a false suggestion. His professional knowledge\nwas too deeply ingrained for him to make such a mistake.\nAnd this has always been my experience. When it is\nattempted to alter a deeply rooted, or instinctive idea, there\nis too strong a counter resistance for it to succeed. In the\nsame way I find it a most difficult task to accomplish a cure\nin traumatic neurasthenia when compensation is being paid\nunder the Act. There is a strong auto-suggestion of uncon-\nscious contentment with the lot of the insured, acting against\nthe treatment.\nThe case of Miss S. has been, and continues to be, my best\ncase, just as she is my most responsive patient to suggestions\ncarried out post-hypnotically, and it consequently deserves\ndealing with in greater detail.\nShe was a patient in whom I feared acute tubercular caries\nof the spine, but when I received the assurance of no less an\nauthority in such matters than Mr. Robert Jones that there\nwas no organic lesion, I entered on a course of treatment by\nhypnosis which has resulted in great improvement. Sleep was\nnot induced until about the tenth sitting. So responsive has\nthis patient become that a single utterance commands imme-\ndiate sleep. With this patient's permission I have carried\nout a number of experiments, a few of which may be worth\nreporting in detail.\nI can at any time carry out the experiment of selecting an\nenvelope from a new packet, which being secretly marked\ninside the flap, is afterwards presented to her with the sugges-\ntion that there is a picture upon the face of the envelope.\nThis is found and easily recognised again after the envelope\nhas been thoroughly mixed with the others in the packet.\n\f382 Sidney Wilkinson, M.B.C.8., L.R.C.P. [part\nA propos of this, I lean to the opinion that the outline of\nthe photograph is sub-consciously associated with fine points of\ndissimilarity on the surface of the paper, perceived through the\ninduced hyperacuity of vision. I hold this view from the\nfact that I have repeatedly observed in this patient and\nothers, that if the envelope is turned end for end, after it\nhas been shown, and returned in this inverted position to the\npacket, the experiment is a failure. A test recently made to\nsee if the envelope could be distinguished merely by the\nsense of touch met with no success.\nIn August, 1912, 1 was treating a patient who did not resporjd\nas readily as I wished to my suggestions, and hoping to help\nhim by example, I showed him this patient, and used a test\nwhich proved more interesting since than at the time.\nI instructed her that when she was awakened she would\ndiscover that we were alone, and that the gentleman who was\nin the room when she fell asleep had left, and further, that she\nwould find her hat upon the stand in the corner.\nThe gentleman meanwhile stood in the corner, holding the\nhat upon his left hand, as though upon a peg, his right hand\nbeing similarly extended.\nShe awoke, and asked if the gentleman had gone, and\nquite unconcernedly she took her hat, and completing her\ntoilet, she left, fully under the belief that he was no longer\nthere.\nSo far there is nothing unusual in such a negative test.\nWhen at home she remarked upon the new stand which I\nwas supposed to have bought, and when next she came I asked\nher, when hypnotised, to draw it. This she did, and the result\nis seen in Plate B, Fig. 2. It is significant that in the waking\nstate she is unable to make even an attempt at drawing a\nstraight line, her efforts in this direction being represented\nin Plate B, Fig. 1.\nEleven months elapsed, when it occurred to me one day to\nask her to draw the stand again from memory. In the mean-\ntime she had not seen the drawing. I had seen it myself\nmany times, yet as I watched her draw the second one I had\na sudden misgiving that she was going to make an error when\nI watched her commence the fourth row of pegs (Plate B,\nFig. 3). Yet she was right and I was wrong. Even the\n\fx,xix.] Recent Experience in Hypnotic Practice. 383\nunevenness of the upper slopes correspond, the thick line at\nthe base, the double lines in the mirror, and the transverse\nand longitudinal shadings are all correct.\nI have pointed out these similarities on many occasions to\nmy friends, and ought to be very familiar with every line of\nthe drawing.\nAs a comparison, therefore, when writing this article, I took\na piece of paper and a pencil and drew Fig. 4, Plate B to see\nhow I could do it. With all the advantages which I possessed,\n\u2014\nviz. ability to copy a drawing with some accuracy, and having\nseen both drawings at least a score of times, and particularly\nhaving pointed out details of likeness,\u2014I could not remember\njust how the slopes were disposed, Avhether the double lines\nsurrounded the whole of the mirror or lay only upon the left\nof it, and I was utterly at fault when I tried to bring to\nmind the outlines of the umbrella rails and, as the results\n\"\nshow, I was quite wrong.\nThese details were of great interest to me, and speak volumes\nior sub-conscious accuracy of recollection after so long a\nperiod. To make my report a complete one, I must add that\nthe gentleman who stood as a model for the stand was not,\nas I hoped he would be, made susceptible to hypnosis thereby,\na,nd I regard his case as one of my failures.\nI have several times given this patient instructions to carry\nout complicated directions and she has never failed me. A\nspecific instance will illustrate the kind of post-hypnotic fulfil-\nment that I refer to.\nI was asked to speak at a gathering where a question of\nPsychical Research was under discussion\u2014the theme of the dis-\ncussion being Sir W. F. Barrett's little book bearing the above\ntitle. Two weeks before the event was due to take place, I\ngave hypnotic instructions to Miss S. to present herself at the\nhouse of meeting on the date specified at 8 p.m. It was a\npart of the town that she had never visited before, so that all\nthe routes and names were new to her. It involved a journey\nby two tram-cars, and a walk of rather more than half a\nmile. Her directions were supplied twice, verbally, with\ninjunctions to ask for the hostess by name, and when ushered\ninto the room she was to fall asleep immediately and remain\nin that condition until I needed her. No one was informed\n2b\n\f384 Sidney Wilkinson, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P. [part\nof my intentions except the girl's mistress, whose permission\nhad to be gained to permit her to leave.\nThis lady takes an intelligent interest in the experiments\nand co-operates with me heartily, so that there was no fear of\nprompting, in addition to which the lady was only supplied\nwith the bare information that I wanted Miss S. on that day..\nIt is probable that she knew the lady's name to whose house\nshe was to proceed, but she did not know the locality of this\nhouse, the name of it, or the road.\nAs events transpired, the mistress also believed the appoint-\nment to be for the afternoon of that day, and as the afternoon\nwore on without the girl making a move, she came to the con-\nclusion that the suggestions had miscarried.\nAll occurred punctually as described to the subject, and it\nwas interesting to trace, step by step, how the impulses to act\ncame to her, and how the names slipped into consciousness as\neach was needed. For instance, the name of the hostess only\ncame into her mind as the maid answered her ring.\nDuring the afternoon of this day she had asked permission\nto do her shopping earlier than usual. Consent was given, and\nas the afternoon went by her employer became uneasy that\nshe had not asked to be released for what she thought was the\ntime I needed her. Nevertheless she did not prompt her, and\nfinally, seeing her linger over her work, she quite made up her\nmind that for once my influence had failed, and she afterwards\ngave up all idea of the matter.\nDuring the waiting at table in the evening, the girl seemed\nabsent-minded, and rather perplexed, but this was not then\nconnected with my suggestions. An hour or so before the\ntime for leaving the house the restlessness increased, and\nMiss S. stood for a long time at the kitchen door looking\nout into the garden, and finally asked to be allowed to\ngo out.\nThis, under the circumstances of the household arrangement,\nwas considered to be an unreasonable request, but was neverthe-\nless somewhat reluctantly granted, and it was not until the\nmatter was discussed, after she had left, that the light of\nunderstanding dawned upon the employers. They realised for\nthe first time that it was an evening assembly and not an after-\nnoon one, as believed up to that moment.\n\flxix.] Recent Experience in Hypnotic Practice. 385\nThis explanation precludes the thought that a hint of assist-\nance might have been given to my patient.\nI have tried some simple tests in telepathy with this subject,\nunder hypnosis, with fair success, but my experiments in this\nline have not been extensive, nor carried out with that care\nwhich would be considered necessary to eliminate all possibility\nof correct answers being given by other means. I was satisfied\nthat she did not see, but in the absence of stricter methods\nI could not expect others to share that satisfaction, and for\nthis reason the experiments are omitted.\nI shall have one other experience to relate about the same\nsubject in my next and last case.\nMiss C.j age 24. This was a case of very severe conversion\nhysteria, having its commencement about eighteen months\nprior to my introduction to the case. There appeared to be\nnothing special in the family history, other members of the\nfamily being normal people. The death of the father six\nmonths previous to the onset was supposed to have had some\nconnection with the illness.\nThere was a small patch of dulness at the apex of one lung,\nbut this did not give rise to any complications, and the definite\nevidence of tubercle was not established.\nThe main points in the symptoms were extreme wasting, the\nweight being but 4 st. 12 lbs. This was due to the persistent\nrefusal of all food, only a little water ever being taken volun-\ntarily. A few tablespoonfuls of milk were occasionally forced\ndown, during twenty-four hours, under very great resistance,\nbut at other times only as many teaspoonfuls were able to be\ngiven. Rectal feeding was equally resisted, and in spite of\nthe frailness of the girl she was able to resist the attempts of\ntwo people to give nourishment by either route.\nThe eyes were closed except momentarily on rare occasions.\nSpeech was equally obstinately withheld, and I believe abso-\nlutely so prior to my visits. The limbs were rigid and the\nlegs were flexed and crossed. The eyes were invariably turned\nup out of sight when the lids were raised. That she was\nconscious was evident, as talk of feeding, or the preparations\nmade for the purpose, were always the signal for crying and\nscreaming.\n\f386 Sidney Wilkinson, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P. [part\nAfter seeing the patient in consultation I made arrangements\nfor her to be brought into residence as a private patient at\nthe Liverpool Psycho-Therapeutic Clinic. This programme,\narranged in her hearing, provoked the first words that she\nhad uttered for months. Although she made no sign in my\npresence, she afterwards protested strongly against being\nmoved. My attempts at persuading her to take food were\nunsuccessful, and she was accordingly fed forcibly, after which\nI tried to induce sleep. The sleep that supervened I thought\nto be the result of my endeavours, until I discovered that she\ninvariably slept from exhaustion after each struggle to feed.\nIndeed I soon discovered that hypnotism was impossible, and\nequally so was the question of psycho-analysis.\nSuggestions were therefore regularly given, though there was\nnever a quiver of an eyelid to show that they were understood.\nAs stated above, I was satisfied on this point by the patient's\nconsciousness whenever feeding was spoken of, and preparations\nwere in progress.\nLater I tried suggestion by transference after the method\ndescribed by the late Dr. Forbes Winslow in the May issue of\nthe Practitioner, 1913.\nMy last-mentioned patient acted as the medium, and when\nhypnotised, her hands were joined to the patient, and I made\nan endeavour to tap the patient's sub-conscious mind by\nquestions addressed to the medium.\nFor some strange reason Miss S. failed me for the first time,\nand offered stubborn resistance to all my attempts. Persever-\nance on my part, coupled with the plea that it was the only\nchance of saving the girl's life, resulted in an outburst of\ncrying from my hypnotised subject. Further questions only\nincreased the distress. I therefore took her into an adjoin-\ning room and left her with pencil and paper, and gave her\ninstructions to write.\nAfter an interval I returned and discovered her with her\nhead on her hands, still sobbing, and with an incomplete\nsentence upon the paper, viz. :\n\" I didn't want to do it, Don't\ntell Una [intended for \" Una,\" the girl's name], Come to\nwhat.\" No amount of coaxing would make her finish the\nsentence, so it had to remain incomplete and senseless.\nTo my question, if she had received any intimation not to\n\flxix.] Recent Experience in Hypnotic Practice. 387\nreveal what she had learned, she answered \" Yes.\" It was\nevident that this interrogation was causing distress, and I\ntherefore desisted, and suggested an amnesia for all that had\noccurred, and not to allow the circumstance to worry her. On\nthe command to awake, she was immediately bright and\nsmiling, with no memory of what she had passed through.\nBefore separating the patient's and the medium's hands, I\nmade such suggestions as I thought would be applicable to\nthe case, from the scant history supplied by the friends, and\nthe general symptoms. The reason given, viz. the death\nof the father, I did not consider sufficient, partly for the\nreason that the event was six months prior to the first\nsymptoms. I thought it far more likely that there had been\na love affair which had caused a more than usually keen\ndisappointment, and I made some suggestions to that effect.\nWhether there was truth in this shot or not, it was the only\nchance that seemed to be left to me.\nIn any event, I had barely left the house before the patient\nwas roused to indignation, and for the first time in months\nspoke freely, and indignantly denied all that I had ventured\nto say, and forthwith evinced a dislike for me, and on each\nsubsequent occasion turned over in bed away from me when-\never she heard my voice, whilst previously I might have been\nabsolutely non-existent, so little did she appear to notice my\npresence, providing I was not preparing to feed her.\nThis increased my belief in the accuracy of my remarks,\nand it was further made evident by the pains with which she\nendeavoured to supply another reason, viz. that she felt that\nshe was not regarded at home with the same esteem as the\nother members of the family, and that in consequence of this\nshe wished to die, and was taking this means of accomplishing\nher end. Apart from being an improbable reason for so grave\na condition, the explanation was not true, since great devotion\nwas shown to her by her people.\nFrom this point in the history I ceased to attend the patient,\nas she expressed a wish to go back to the house where I first\nsaw her, and to be spared from the visits of doctors.\nI considered it best to agree to this, and I did not see her\nagain for two weeks, and hoped that the suggestions would\nmeanwhile wake up fresh conflicts.\n\f388 Sidney Wilkinson, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P. [part\nAt the completion of this period I called to enquire about\nher progress, from her sister, and I was informed that she was\ntaking a little more food, and there seemed some hope that\nimprovement had commenced.\nWhether on account of increased acuity of hearing she\nheard my voice, or by any supernormal means received a sub-\nconscious impression of my presence which set a further train\nof associations in action, or whether my visit was in no way\nconcerned with the change, yet a little time after I left the\nhouse the girl suddenly sat up in bed, asked where she was,\nembraced her sister, enquired after various members of the\nfamily, and stated that she was hungry.\nShe arose and dressed and ate a good meal. She remem-\nbered nothing of the eighteen months, beyond a dim recollec-\ntion of having seen the room she was in before. Of the\nvisits of doctors, change of abode, and other circumstances,\nshe had no recollection. She slept well that night, and for\nseveral days continued to improve, and we believed that there\nwas a promise of a complete return to health. The dis-\nsociated elements had been re-synthetised with the main\nstream of consciousness.\nI wished to complete my investigations into this case, but\nthe friends were reluctant for hypnosis to be tried in order to\nprobe the cause and to try and eliminate the complexes.\nThey were afraid of a recurrence of the old condition, and\nI hesitated to press the point until a later and more robust\nphase should supervene.\nI should like to be able to record that this return to memory\nmarked the commencement of a return to health, but the\nsubsequent history of the case is that the system, worn out by\nlong privation and emotional distress, was too far disorganised\nfor recovery, and she subsequently gradually sank, and,\nas the physical energy gave out, the psychic dissociation\nreturned, and the girl died. She fulfilled her determination,\nas frequently expressed when speech returned.\nIt will be fully appreciated that there were no means of\ninfluencing the sub-conscious mind except by persistently\nrepeated suggestions. Psycho-analysis was as impossible as\nhypnosis, except that it might have been employed after speech\nand memory returned, if opportunity had been granted to me.\n\flxix.] Recent Experience in Hypnotic Practice. 389\nIn conclusion, there may be some people who will laugh at\na serious attempt being made to affect ttiis patient by \" trans-\nference,\" but this method has the support of men who are well\nknown in the profession ; the late Dr. Forbes Winslow was\none who appeared to use it extensively in his practice ; and\nthough I cannot say whether any of the subsequent results\nwere due to this means or not, still two things stand out\nprominently in my mind :\n(1) Some very disturbing element must have entered the per-\nception of my medium in order to cause such obvious distress\nand such blank refusal to divulge her thoughts, and\n(2) After the first sitting the medium knew the patient's\nname, though no mention of it had been made in her presence,\nand when awake she had no knowledge of it.\nSince the death of the patient, I have made other attempts to\nobtain something from Miss S., telling her that it did not matter\nnow that the girl was dead and could not object. Beyond\ntelling me that the secret is one that she cannot divulge,\nshe is adamant, and every effort that I made brought about\nthe same state of sobbing and distress, so that I finally had\nto abandon the task. We must therefore be content to let it\nremain a mystery.\n\f390 V. J. Woolley, M.D. [part\nIX.\nSOME AUTO-SUGGESTED VISIONS AS ILLUSTRATING\nDREAM-FORMATION.\nBy V. J. Woolley, M.D.\nDuring the last few years the study of dreams and their\ncausation has made great advances through the work of Pro-\nfessor Freud of Vienna. His theories have excited the fiercest\ncontroversy on the Continent, particularly among the members\nof the medical profession, and the quarrel has extended in a\nsomewhat milder form to this country, where it has even\nreached the daily press. The last development I personally\nrather regret, since it is only too well known to members\nof this Society what gross misrepresentations and garbled\nnarratives are inevitably produced by such an extension. It\nis in the hope of clearing up one of the grosser misunder-\nstandings of Freud's theory that I venture to bring forward\nsome experiences closely resembling dreams and illustrating\nto some degree what Freud believes to be an important factor\nin the causation of the dream state.\nIt is probably known to most people that Freud believes\nthat every dream originates in some impulse or tendency\ntowards action present in the unconscious part of our mind.\nEvery dream, moreover, represents in some way, generally a\nsymbolic or distorted way, the carrying out into action of some\nsuch impulse. This theory is usually put in the form of the\nstatement ''every dream represents the fulfilment of a wish,\"\na statement which I think is very misleading, and has caused\nan immense amount of misunderstanding of Freud's con-\nception.\nAs we ordinarily use the word, when we say \" I wish to\ndo this or that,\" we mean that we have considered the pros\n\flxix.] Visions Illustrating Dream -Formation. 391\nand cons and are actually willing and anxious to adopt this\nor that line of conduct. In Freud's sense, however, the word\nwish implies nothing of this kind. As I have expressed it\nabove, it implies no more than that there is present in some\npart of our mind a tendency towards a particular line of\naction ; but this tendency may be so checked and resisted\nby other existing conditions, such, for instance, as ideas of\nduty or of worldly wisdom, that it in no way corresponds\nto the real line of conduct which we are willing to follow.\nIn fact, it often happens that some such impulse is so opposed\nto the ideas on which our conscious life is based that it fails\naltogether to penetrate to our consciousness. It is delibe-\nrately kept out by a mental mechanism which works without\nour knowledge, and is called by Freud the Zensur, or Censor.\nWhen we sleep this Censor is weakened in its working ; it\nis not strong enough to keep out these impulses completely,\nbut it succeeds in distorting them, so that they are no longer\nrecognizable by our conscious mind ; or we may put it that\nthey manage to disguise themselves sufficiently to slip past\nthe sleepy sentinel and take advantage of their chance to\ndo so.\nIt is in this sense that dreams represent the distorted ful-\nfilment of an unconscious wish or impulse. Yet it has been\ncontinually urged by those who have not read Freud's writings\nthat dreams so often go counter to our wishes, or are unpleasant,\nor that we dream that we murder some one against whom we\nhave no ill will , that they cannot be said to be the fulfilment of\nour wishes. I have said enough to show that such an objection\nis baseless, but the dream-like visions I am going to discuss\ngive, I think, a clearer illustration of the dream method than\ncan be got from the ordinary dreams of sleep.\nThese visions consist of a number of self-suggested hallucina-\ntions which were experienced by one of our foreign members.\nHe has placed them at the disposal of the Society, and I hope\nthat at some future date they may be described in detail by\nsome one who is personally acquainted with him. (See Miss\nJohnson's paper below.) I have only selected a few which\nseem to illustrate the point I hope to make clear.\nThis gentleman, whom I will call Mr. Grunbaum, suffered\nin 1911 from some kind of nervous breakdown which he says\n\f392 V. J. Woolley, M.I). [PART\nhe determined to cure by means of self-hypnotism. He\nwrites :\nMy intention was first to influence the different senses and then\nthe psychical part of myself. Therefore one day in the end of\nSeptember [1911] I sat down in a chair with a sheet of white paper\nin front of me. I took some solution (of bromural or something\nlike it) in order to get a little sleepy, and then I told myself that\nafter awaking I should see a black charcoal line on the white paper\nsheet. I really got sleepy, and after a while I saw a very decora-\ntive line on the paper in front of me. A voice in my head told\nme \" This is on account of the experiment you are making.\"\nThereupon the line vanished. Then I tried again to get the line\nstraight, but that would never succeed. It was always more or\nless decorative. The one that came nearest to the straight line\nwas about this [here he gives a sketch of a complex figure of several\nloops and curves suggesting nothing in particular].\nSo [he concludes] I gave that up, and one of the following days\nI tried a more complicated thing. I tried a young lady. She\ndid come and even without any drug. It was as follows : In\norder to get tired I had been making a long walk and thereupon\nI sat down again and told myself that after awaking I should see\na young lady. After some 20 minutes I got aware of some kind\nof whirlpool where there seemed to be flames or firework. Then\nthe thing got the shape of a lady coming in a great speed towards\nme. She was all the while smiling friendly and seemed to be in\na great haste. She held up her dresses at one side with her hand\nin order to be able to go quickly. I saw them flying in the wind\nand I saw her feet go very quick. When she was about the size\nof 1 foot English then the voice said again that it was on account\nof my experiment, and then I began to make up my mind that\nit might come out to be interesting when she came nearer, where-\nupon she vanished.\nThe next account I shall quote describes as follows his\nexperience while undergoing hypnotic treatment from a\nphysician whom he had consulted for the relief of his\nsymptoms :\nI got aware of something moving and turning in front of and above\nmy forehead. It took the shape of a disk of some 4 feet diameter.\n\fxxix.] Visions Illustrating Dream-Formation. 393\nInside that disk there was sitting a young lady. It was a beautiful\ncreature with a very friendly charming face. She nodded her head\nvery nicely towards me. I said \" Who are you ?\n\" She answered,\n\" I am your Self-control. \" (I had read in Dr. Bramwell's book that\nthe chief aim of every hypnotic treatment should be to develop\nthe patient's self-control, but I had never thought of the idea\n\"that it meant to develop a young lady.)\n\" Just feel how real I am,\" she said, and she stretched out\nher arm and hand towards me. So I gave her a pat on her\nfingers. I heard the sound it made and felt the touch. Then\nI noticed on that occasion something extraordinary : I felt in\nher hand just as well as my own hand. That is to say, that I\nfelt just the same as when one is touching his own right hand\nwith his left hand. My own hands were, however, not touching\none another, but were lying on the woollen cover.\nThereupon she began to make arrangements to step out of the\ndisc. She put her foot outside. I still remember the beautifully\ndecorated silk stocking. I could see every stitch of the silk. So\nI made directly up my mind that she had better stay in there,\nas I began to feel uneasy that there might something get wrong in\nmy brains. She noticed my fear directly : I could see it on her\nface. So I returned to common consciousness and she dis-\nappeared.\nI have quoted the last vision chiefly in order to make clear\nsome others that follow, but I may here draw attention to\nwhat is disclosed in it by the most superficial analysis. We\n\u2022can easily discern three desires which form the motive force\nof the vision : the wish to pass into a hypnotic trance, to\n\u2022develop his self-control, and to see a young lady. The first\ntwo are derived from Dr. Bramwell's book which he had just\nbeen reading : the third is sufficiently common in all the\nvisions to make one certain that it is nearly always present\nin the unconscious. In the book there is a good deal said of\nthe method of producing hypnosis by a circular mirror or disc\nheld above and in front of the eyes, and it will be seen how\nprecisely the disc containing the vision is located at this spot.\nAfter this vision Mr. Griinbaum began to address his Self-\ncontrol much as spiritualists address \"controls\" at a seance.\nI quote next a vision of February 1, 1912 :\n\f394 V. J. Woolley, 31. D. [part\n(Young lady's hand.)\nI sit down after dinner and after a while I speak to myself as.\nfollows :\n\" My dear Self-control, \" I say, \" where have you gone to ? Now\ncome back, there is a chance for you here to try your powers,\ngranted that you behave exactly in the way I want you to. Come,\ncome, come, show me your little hand.\"\nResult.\u2014After some 20 minutes, at the moment of getting a\nlittle dreamy, I see a disk in front of my closed eyes\u2014about one\nfoot in diameter and at about one foot distance. There is nothing\nin it except a piece of staniol. This takes the shape of a flower.\nThen there comes at the underpart of the disk a red-brown hand,\nall stiff as if carved from wood. It is connected to a long brown\narm and moves upwards. It takes hold of the staniol-flower and\nshows it to me. It turns it to and fro and disappears at the under-\npart of the disk, taking the flower with it.\n(February 2.) Young lady's hand.\nI say :\n\" Dear Self-control, you seem to have made a mistake\nyesterday. I wanted to see your own hand, keep that well in\nmind ; go on, as you are on the right track.\"\nResult : a lady's hat.\u2014It is beautifully ornamented with silk and\nvelvet trimmings all of a dark colour. It is more than K foot\nbroad and turned slightly upwards so as to show to me the hollow\ncrown.\nI say :\n\" My dear lady-friend, you must be mistaken, as this\nis not a hand but a hat ; try again.\"\nDirectly hereon the hat begins to turn around its axes, and\nthere comes something glistening around the corner and more and\nmore into the light. It is then brilliantly illuminated and turns\nout to be a brooch. It is silver plated and is as a Christmas card :\ntwo hands folded together. Then the hat turns to and fro and\nto and fro as if it were to show to me how nice it is.\nIt fades away and then comes a small nickel-plated press-papier\nwith a nickel hand on it.\n(Note.\u2014In the morning of that day I had seen in a lunch-room\na girl with a rather nice hat with trimmings of silk and velvet.\nThere was no brooch on it, but she wore a band around her waist\nfastened with such a brooch.)\n\flxix.] Visions Illustrating Dream-Formation. 395\n(February 3.) Bouquet of flowers.\nI speak as follows :\n' L\nSelf-control, here is something you'll like,\nas it is flowers ;\njust the thing for you. After you have shown\nthe bouquet to me you must let me smell the delicious flavour of\nthe flowers ; don't forget that.\"\nResult : A pair of slippers.\u2014They are pointing with their em-\nbroidered toes towards me. The toes are embroidered with coloured\ncotton wool, roses and buds.\nThen all at once I get the most fearful stink in my nose, as I\nhad never before. It was, in fact, worse than rotten eggs. I pull\nmyself out of it with a start.\n(February 8.) Boy.\nI give an order to show me a boy. I keep this idea in mind and\npicture it out in front of me.\nResult : my own face making an ugly grimace at me.\n(Note.\u2014I fail altogether to see any connection between this face\nand a boy. But afterwards, on February 10, talking the affair\nover with Mr. Feilding, I remember that on February 7 I had been\nlooking in a small mirror hanging in a corridor in order to inspect\none of my teeth. On that occasion I had made the remark :\n\" Well, you are a nice boy ; would you make yourself younger\nwith your suggestion ? You are decidedly getting older.'\")\n(February 10).

In\nthe course of that conversation Mr. Feilding told me that it had\nbeen on the river Rhine.)\n(February 14.) Rose.\nI point out to my Self-control that she seems to have lost the\nright track last time. So I'll help her by trying to picture out the\nrose in front of me.\n\f396 V. J.

They all, how-\never, have one character in common. With the rarest excep-\ntions, the vision which Mr. Griinbaum actually experienced\nwas not the one that he wished for and expected. Sometimes,\nas in the smell of the carpet slippers, it was just the reverse,\nbut in most it was more or less clearly connected in a way\nwhich he was able himself to detect. In some, which are not\nquoted, no connection was obvious to him, but I have no\ndoubt that a connection could be established by any one\nwho was sufficiently acquainted with his thoughts, and his\nassociation tendencies.\nThe object of this paper is to controvert the objection to\nFreud's theory of dreams, which is based on the fact that\ndream experiences are not obviously pleasant or satisfying to\nthe dreamer. I have mentioned earlier that the motive force\nof the dream is to be sought in some desire or impulse which\ncannot obtain gratification in waking life, on account either\nof outward circumstances or of inward judgment. It is this\nincompatibility with the waiving life that causes the disguise\nwhich renders the desire unrecognizable.\nIn Mr. Griinbaum 's visions, the place of the desire is taken\nby his wish to experience a particular vision. As that wish\nis conscious, it does not need to be rendered unrecognizable;\nbut it does succeed in associating itself with some elements\nfrom the unconscious which bring about the moderate distortion\nwhich is present. To know what those elements are, it would\nbe necessary to know what ideas could be associated in his\nmind with the various items of the visions,\u2014a knowledge\nwhich could only come from a prolonged and detailed study.\nAll that I have tried to shew is that such a vision may be\ndemonstrably based upon a definite wish, while it fulfils that\nwish in a distorted or disguised manner.\n\f400 Alice Johnson. [part\nX.\nPSEUDO-PHYSICAL PHENOMENA IN THE CASE OF\nMR. GRUNBAUM.\nBy Alice Johnson.\nMr. Grunbaum's narrative, some parts of which are discussed\nabove by Dr. Woolley, includes various incidents which closely\nresemble certain types of alleged \" physical phenomena,\" and\nmay instructively be compared with them, since it is clear that\nin Mr. Grunbaum's case the apparently material effects were\nreally hallucinatory, while the actually material effects were\nfound to be produced by his own automatic and unconscious\naction. These incidents being outside the scope of Dr. Woolley's\npaper are given separately here ; but as they obviously\nbelong to the same train of psychical events, they will be\nbest understood if seen in their proper setting. I there-\nfore quote some cases of the same kind as those already\ngiven, in the midst of which what I may call the \" pseudo-\nphysical \" phenomena occurred.\nAs stated by Dr. Woolley, Mr. Griinbaum wished to cure\nhimself by self-suggestion, and, with a view to testing his\nsusceptibility, he tried first to influence his different senses,\nintending afterwards to affect his general mental condition.\nShortly after the first vision of the young lady, the following\noccurred :\nNext day I tried sound. I said that I should hear my name\ncalled. I did so. After about fifteen minutes I heard myself called\nin a very bright way.\nThen I said that I should feel myself touched. This it did in a\nrather curious way, as it pulled my coat a couple of times. Now\nthis was not exactly what I had been aiming at. So I tried again\n\fLXIX.] Pseudo-PhysicaI Phenomena\n.\n401\nand said that I should feel a hand. It did so and I felt a hand\nbeing laid on mine. This rather startled me, notwithstanding I\nhad asked for it myself.\nSo I made up my mind, that whereas I had been so fortunate\nwith the different senses, I might now go over to the psychical\nside of myself. Here I found myself, however, in front of an\nobstacle. The fact is that when you are getting sleepy, then you\ncannot repeat your suggestion any more. Therefore I prepared a\nwax-record for my Edison Phonograph, saying that I should go to\nsleep very quietly and after awakening all my troubles should be\ngone.\nThe effect of listening to this record was very wonderful. It\nmight have run some 4 minutes (I had altered the speed of my\nphonograph in such a way that it ran 8 minutes) when I got aware\nof a most extraordinary sensation. The tonation wherein the words\nwere spoken had a very curious influence on me : it felt like an\nintoxication of the soul. There is, however, nothing that feels like\nit, nor can it be compared with anything else. The sound of my\nown words nearly made me dance.\nIt was decidedly agreeable and felt like going right up to Heaven.\nIf somebody had cut off one of my hands in that state, then I\nthink that I should have perfectly enjoyed it. Then the voice\nsaid that it was on account of my experiment, and I opened my\neyes and there I saw the wax record rapidly spinning around (it\nhad advanced about up to the middle of the whole length) ; during\nsome words I still felt that extraordinary sensation, and thereupon\nthe sensation ended.\nSo I was very content with my success, and then I began to\nconsult Mr. Bramwell's book in order to find out into which hyp-\nnotic state I had worked myself. But I could find neither head\nnor tail in it, in so far that I read therein that the senses could be\ninfluenced in the deep stage, and I had never been aware of having\nbeen in any stage at all, except during that very curious sensation.\nSo I got hold of a very old book concerning Faust. (I should\nnot have done this, by the way.) I found different formulas in it, as :\n'\n' Tetragrammaton\u2014Adonai\u2014Agla\u2014come\u2014come\u2014come. '\n'\nI did not pay any special attention to this at the time ; but at\nnight time, when lying in my bed and just at the moment of going\nto sleep, there came a thought flashing through my head. It said :\n\" Tetraagrammaton\u2014Adonai\u2014Agla.\" Nor did I pay any attention\n\f402 Alice Johnson. [part\nto it, as I had no notion that the effect of it would be so fearful.\nA short while afterwards I saw a broad spectre standing at the\nend of my bedside. It was about five feet high and three feet\nbroad. It consisted of a body and a head. I did not see any eyes\nin it, nor was it a real spectre ; it was only the flat drawing of a\nspectre. It was drawn in blue smoky outlines, all vibrating There\nwas nothing fearful in the thing itself, but I cannot say how it was\nthat the thing gave me such a tremendous fright (the whole thing\nwas connected with a feeling of wrong, black mischief). I was\nlying on my right side, so that there could be no question about\nnightmare ; besides I never have such a thing as nightmare, unless\nI am lying flat on my back. My heart seemed to have come to a\ndead stop. Then all at once it started with a fearful speed. So\nI jumped out of my bed and drank a glass of water. By means of\ncounter-suggestions and very heavy slow breathing, I mastered the\npalpitation of my heart, but it took as long as half an hour before\nit began to beat at moderate speed again. I slept very little that\nnight.\nNext day I listen again to my phonograph-record, but it gives\nno result whatever. I feel very sorry about this, as all the other\nexperiments gave me such a peaceful agreeable feeling. That night\nI do not try anything else any more, but all at once, contrary to\nmy expectation, the same spectre is there, but that time standing\nat my bed side, decidedly looking at me. So it had come nearer.\nI jump directly out of my bed and my heart starts beating\nagain, although not half as bad as the other day. Thereupon I\nthink that I slept a little.\nNext day I prepare a special record with the suggestion that I\nshall feel happy, etc. ; but I get no result whatever. I feel very\ndepressed about this and write the whole affair (without the spectre)\nto Mr. Bramwell, who answers me that I had better consult a com-\npetent physician.\nAs a result of this advice, Mr. Griinbaum went (as stated\nabove by Dr. Woolley) to a physician for hypnotic treat-\nment on October 17, 1911. He received about thirteen\ntreatments, at the rate first of twice a week, then once a\nweek, and afterwards once a fortnight. The effect was excel-\nlent, and he recovered completely from the abnormal mental\ncondition.\n\fLXIX.] Pseudo-Physical Phenomena. 403\nMeanwhile, however, various hallucinations occurred to him\nspontaneously. One form of these seems to have been the\ndistorted result of an external suggestion, just as some others\nwere the distorted result of self-suggestions. He describes this\nas follows :\nIn the beginning of November, when I was going to have one of\nmy teeth drilled, the doctor gave me a suggestion concerning this\nin the waking state. The effect of it, after a while lying on the\nsofa, was a feeling as if I received a blow on my head with a club,\nand as if all my brains were pulled together by means of a string.\nAt the same time I felt a tingling in that special tooth.\nNext day, on the way to the dentist, that sensation was repeated,\nand the tooth was drilled without any special discomfort from my\nside. I will call this sensation the \" club-blow,\n,\n\" as we shall see that\nit is to be repeated many a time afterwards masked for.\nThen came the day when I received the Journal of the S.P.R.,\nwherein is described the case of \" Anna Burton.\" 1\nThis thing\nseems to have evoked quite a stir in my subliminal being.\nIt was as follows : I think it must have been on November 11th\nthat I received that special Journal. Not having had a chance to\nread it in the day-time, I took it along with me to bed and, after\nlighting the candle, I began to read the case all through. So I\nmade up my mind that it was no way of experimenting at all, if\none is asking in total darkness to be touched, whereas I had been\ndoing that [with success] in plain daylight, being all alone and as\na result of my own suggestions. Also I made up my mind that\nif the doctor who made that experiment had smeared some lamp-\nblack on his fingers, he might then have been able to make out\nif he had really been touching his own right hand with his left hand,\nor if somebody else did it, or if it was a hallucination. But it is\nalways very easy to make up your mind what other people should\nhave done. So I blew out my candle and lay down to sleep.\nI was, however, to get aware of something else, before sleep\nshould come. Just at the verge of falling asleep, there shot a\nthought through my head saying :\n\" Shall I touch you a little ?\n\"\nDirectly afterwards I received a \" club -blow \" on my brain ; it\nwas accompanied by a white silhouette of a hand on a black back-\nground. I saw this hand at the back of my head. I recognised\n1\nJournal S.P.R., November, 1.911.\n\f404 Alice Johnson. [part\ndirectly in it the exact reproduction of a black hand on a white\nbackground that had once been printed in the Annals [of Psychical\nScience] 1\nin an article by Prof. Richet on \" The Spirit of Pres-\nbourg.\" Then, not expecting anything particular, I fell asleep,\nwhen all at once I was taken hold of by two big hands. They took\nhold of me in my sides and gave me eight strong squeezes.\nIt was not at all disagreeable. After the first four squeezes I\nsaid :\n\" Don't get higher,\" as I was afraid that it would come in\nmy face. It responded directly to what I said and gave me four\nmore squeezes lower down. Thereupon I cried :\n\" Don't get lower !\n\"\nand then it finished.\nIt was done with very great force. It lifted me right up (this,\nat least, is what it felt like) ; but it may have been my own muscles\ndoing that. The first series made me bump with my head against\nthe wall and the second series nearly threw me out of bed.\nI was not at all frightened. These hands felt as if they had\ngloves on and were at the inside lined with cotton wool.\nOn the night of November 14th (I am not altogether sure of the\ndate) I received such a sudden blow on my head, that I was alto-\ngether startled by it. I thought that this was to be the end of my\nlife, such a tremendous bump I received on my brains. I all at\nonce resisted and said :\n\" Get away, whatever you may be, as I\ndid not call for you !\n\" Then I got a sensation, as if there were\nchampagne all foaming through my body from the tips of my toes\nto the top of my head, all up and down, my brains at the same\ntime being handled in the above-named way. I would not let go\nfor anything. Then I felt as if my spine was pushed upwards\nand as if there was being made a trial to lift me up. The perspira-\ntion came all over my body and the bed began to dance up and\ndown at least a foot, and all other kind of nervous phenomena.\nThen I compared the top of the bedside with the figures on the\nwall-paper, and I felt that they were going up and down together.\nThen I said to myself :\n\" Well, my dear, so you see that the bed\ndoes not move.\" After a while I mastered the position and I was\nglad that I kept master in my own house.\nThen there happened something very curioiis. In this very quiet,\ntotally exhausted state, it was all at once as if there opened itself\nsomething before me and there came a very big hand some foot\nlong, with fingers of some 2 inches, all vibrating towards me. It\n1\nVol. I. pp. 210-212, April, 1905\n\f:lxix.] Pseudo-Physical Phenomena. 405\ndid so extremely carefully. I tried to get hold of it, but it with-\ndrew. So it did a couple of times when at last I got hold of the\nthing and I felt that it had some resistance. After a Avhile there\ncame something more\u2014shoulders and a head. It was as if it were\nmade from cigar-smoke, all vibrating and changing its position.\nThen I said :\n\" Who are you ?\n\"\nHe said : \"I am Urlus \" (this is, by the way, the name of a\nGerman opera-singer). Then I said :\n\" Well, this may be or it may\nnot be, but what do you want ? \" Then Urlus said (I was dreaming\nwith my eyes half open) : \"I am going to materialise for you.\"\nWhereupon he began to manipulate and after a while there stood\na complete man in front of me with very broad shoulders. Then,\ntaking hold of my left pulse, he squeezed me rather painfully.\nThen he said :\n\" Just feel my shoulders, how strong they are.\"\nThen I slapped him on his shoulders and remarked to him that\nit sounded rather like cardboard. Whereupon Urlus said :\n\" You\nare right, in so far that it really sounds like cardboard, but you\nshould not forget that it is artificial.\"\nThereafter I went through a common dream, giving him lemonade\nto drink (a remembrance of \" Bien-Boa \" ?\n1\n). I felt very proud\nof having such a big man for my companion. Then all at once I\nfound myself lying with my eyes open and my candle still burning.\nI wondered about the curious experience and soon after I went\nto sleep.\nOn November loth and 16th the thing repeated itself in so far\nthat there began all kinds of objects to fall around me. I heard\nthe loud blows ; I also heard the sound as if people were hammering\nwith a chisel on big stones. I remember one object coming so near\nthat it flew right through my nose. Mr. Urlus did not come that\ntime. Then during the day I made up my mind that at night\ntime I seemed to be in a somewhat abnormal state of mind and\nI prepared a glass plate all covered with lamp-black. As I had\nread that other people claimed to have got impressions in that way\non such glasses, so I thought that I might just as well try for\nmyself.\n1 \" Bien-Boa \" was the name given to the \"materialised\" form that\nappeared at the seances held by Professor Richet at Algiers in 1905 with\nthe medium Marthe B. (see Miss Verrall's article above, pp. 333 et seq.)\nas reported in the Annals of Psychical Science for October and November,\n1905. The photographs of \"Bien-Boa\" there reproduced are probably the\norigin of Mr. Grunbaum's \"Urlus.\"\n\f406 Alice Johnson. [part\nSo I did. I fastened the plate to the wall along my bedside.\nThen, when I felt that my brains began to work, I said as follows r\n\" Well, Mr. Urlus ; in case you might come back to-night, I pro-\npose that, instead of handling my body with your big hands, you\nmight try to press one of your hands on the glass plate. I have\narranged it specially for you, so I suppose that you will make use\nof it. It has the great advantage that it does not keep me out of\nmy sleep, and you only need to use one hand instead of your whole\nbody. Besides this, it may leave a mark of your presence.\" So\nI went to sleep.\nIn the morning I am perplexed, as I find that the black plate\nhas been really tampered with.\nThere was no impression of a hand on it, but the lamp-black\nover about a third of the surface was rubbed clean off. I began to\nsearch. My head-pillow on the place where I am lying with my\nhead is all smeared with lamp-black. There is also lamp-black on\nthe wall. Then I search my hands. They are all clean ;\nmy nails\nthe same, but looking in my mirror, I find that the inside of my\nleft ear is black, also behind my ear it is smeared.\nThen I begin to search the bed-clothes. I find that the right\ncorner at the foot end of the upper sheet leaves a black trace on the\nwhite pillow when I rub that corner with force on it. The other\ncorners do not do that. So the operation must have been done\nwith that special corner. As my door was locked, there cannot\nhave been anybody else in the room except myself. So I must\nhave been doing that myself and I must have been taking scrupulous\ncare not to leave any trace of the modus operandi.\nI am, however, not aware of ever having done such a thing, so\nthat I cannot make this very clear.\nThe vision of the young lady quoted above in Dr. Woolley's\naccount, p. 393, followed shortly afterwards.\nMr. Griinbaum goes on :\nOne or two days after that had happened, I think on November\n17th, I tried \" direct writing.\"\nI prepared a black plate, put it inside a box, but left a round\nhole in the box cover. I put also some scraps of pencil inside the\nbox. I put that box under my head-pillow and as I liked that\nyoung lady much better than the big hands of Mr. Urlus, I began\nto address her and I said :\n\fLXIX.] Pseudo-Physical Phenomena. 4(17\n\" My dear Self-control, can you write on the plate under my\nhead-pillow without opening the cover of the box ?\n\"\nI received directly an answer to that question in the shape of\na sound. First I heard something fumbling in the pillow and then\nI heard that there was something written on the plate. Then\nthere was drawn a line and after that there was put a big point at\nthe end. Then I thought :\n\" Now we shall have what we want.\"\nI got out of bed, took a glass of water, and then I said to myself :\n\" Well, now you look at it.\" So I opened the box and there was\nnothing written on it.\nAfter describing one or two other experiences, Mr. Grunbaum\ncontinues :\nI made up my mind to have absolutely nothing to do with that\nkind of thing, as it was all at work by itself and not at all to be\nhandled by me. So at night-time I gave myself strong suggestions\nto do nothing else but sleep quietly.\nIt came back a couple of times in another shape.\nOne night (I think I had been reading the Proceedings) when\nI had gone upstairs to my bedroom, I was just in the act of taking\nmy coat off, when it was puUed a couple of times. So I took it\noff altogether. But when I was opening my vest, after I had\nloosened the buttons, and just when I was moving one tip of it\nsidewards, I felt some resistance. I thought that it might be a\nmotor automatism of my left arm, but when I felt with my right\nhand in front of me, I felt that there was some fluidic kind of thing\nstanding in front of me. This thing gave me a fearful fright. I rushed\ntowards the curtains, and pulled them high up. I think that it is a\ntouch that makes one feel afraid, especially when it is not expected.\nAfter I had gone to bed that night I did, of course, not feel\nquite certain about what was going to happen, when all at once\nI felt as if somebody gave me a stroke with a fan towards my\nface. All my mouth, hps, etc., felt as cold as ice ; it felt just as if\nsome icy cold air were blown towards my face. A short while after\nthat I heard somebody whistle. It was done rather nicely. I con-\ncluded that it was a hallucination. But then I noticed that when\nI closed my ears, I did not hear it so well, and when I opened them\nI heard it. This puzzled me again and, feeling with my hands\ntowards my hps, I felt that my own lips did it. Then I got out of\nbed and took a glass of water.\n\f408 Alice Johnson. [part\nSo I had a long conversation with my own \" Self-control,\" and\nI pointed out to her that the only way to give her a chance to\nshow her powers was, in my case, that she should behave exactly\naccording to my directions. She never said a word, but at the\nend of my conversation I got a squeeze in my brains, accompanied\nby a young lady's bust and face looking very disdainfully at me.\nShe then started and flew far away and away, all the time looking\nat me, until she was no more than a point. I specially noticed her\nvery high white collar.\nMr. Griinbaum, having found that his experiments led to\nresults which he did not desire, now determined to give them\nup. Some weeks later, however, when it seemed that the\nhypnotic treatment had completely restored his mental\nbalance, he began again to feel attracted by the idea of trying\nthe effects of self-suggestion and started his experiments once\nmore. He now found that he could no longer induce the\nmental state in which he could, as he expresses it, \" create\n\"\nthings,\u2014the state, that is, in which all his senses were affected\nat once by the hallucination, which therefore assumed the\nmost realistic form possible. He could only induce visual\nhallucinations. It is these visions of which Dr. Woolley has\nquoted some typical instances. Later, the complicated type\nrecurred, and in the following case the realism was carried so\nfar that the whole room appeared to him to be affected, the\nfloor seeming to vibrate :\n{July 5, 1912, at night.)\nWithout any intention on my part, I awake at about 3 o'clock\nat night. Then I am looking out for a vision. There comes nothing\nat all.\nAll at once I hear mentally behind myself the loud noise of the\nrattling of an iron chain (at about 3.15).\nMy attention is drawn by this and then I hear behind myself\nfour very heavy footsteps. They are given in a very decided way\nat intervals of about two seconds. (It sounds exactly as if a heavy\niron statue had taken a fancy to walking about a wooden floor.)\nAt the same time I see a dark column coming down at me at\nmy back. The thing was about 5\\ or 6 feet high, and I saw a trans-\nparent black veil over the top part, something like this drawing.\n\fLXIX.] Pseudo-Physical Phenomena. 409\n[Drawing of a completely draped figure.]\nIt was a visual mental image. At every footstep I hear the floor\nbehind myself vibrating (all mentally). I get afraid of the thing\nand lack the courage to let it come nearer, and draw myself out of\nthe trance.\nI make up my mind that this curious phenomenon must be the\nsame as in those cases in which people claim to have heard footsteps.\nMr. Grunbaum, whom I had known for some years by\ncorrespondence, described a good many of these experiences to\nme in a long talk which I had with him at the rooms of the\nS.P.R. when he was once for a few days in London, and\nthis talk strongly confirmed the impression I had already\nformed of him as an intelligent and accurate reporter.\nIt may, nevertheless, not be out of place to conclude this\npaper with a warning of the risk of trying experiments such\nas are described in it. There is clearly a possibility that\nhallucinations, if once deliberately started, may develop\nand tend to recur spontaneously and more and more fre-\nquently till the whole mind may conceivably be thrown out\nof gear. Mr. Griinbaum himself was not unaware of this\npossibility, and especially desired that, if his experiences\nwere published, readers should be warned of it. He thus\ndescribes what he regards as the greatest danger of all :\n\" I found it as a rule very easy to manoeuvre myself into\nsome mental state from which I could not get myself out\nagain.\" Another danger, he adds, is \" Voices talking in\nthe head. On many occasions I heard a whole conversa-\ntion concerning the suggestion. I think there is nothing\nabnormal in this. But sometimes these conversations were\nall of a sudden interrupted by a sentence, or a part of a\nsentence, not at all belonging to the conversation. These\ncurious voices would induce either direct visions or post-\nhypnotic hallucinations.\" Hallucinatory voices are well known\nto be a frequent accompaniment of mental disease, occurring\nmuch more frequently than visual hallucinations.\nBut it is to be noted that throughout all this series of some-\nwhat disturbing experiences, Mr. Grunbaum never allowed\nhimself to be deceived into imagining\" that his hallucinations\nhad any objective reality ; he never seriously supposed that\n\f410 Alice Johnson. [part\nanything beyond his own mind was at work. It was this\ncompletely sane view that no doubt prevented the ill effects\nthat might otherwise have followed. If he had believed, as\nmany persons under the same circumstances would have been\ntempted to believe, that \" spirits \"\u2014evil, or merely mischievous\n\u2014were at work, the consequences might have been serious. It\nseems to me, indeed, that modern attempts to revive the\nmischievous doctrine of demon-possession have much to answer\nfor through the encouragement thereby given to the de-\nvelopment of latent or incipient delusions in ignorant and\nunbalanced minds. Against these tendencies Mr. Griin-\nbaum was fortunately forearmed by his acquaintance with\nthe work of the S.P.R., aided by the not inconsiderable sense\nof humour which enables him to take an impersonal view\nof his own mental processes.\n\fXXIX.] Review. 41 I\nREVIEW.\nPsychopaihology of Everyday Life. By Professor Sigmund Freud,\nLL.D. Authorised English Edition, with an Introduction by\nA. A. Brill, Ph.B , M.D. (T. Fisher Unwin, 1 Adelphi Terrace,\nLondon, W.C. 1914. Price 12s. Gd. net.)\nThis long looked-for translation has fulfilled the promises of interest\nawakened in us by the brief presentations of writers upon psycho-\nanalysis. The present volume grew out of an essay published in\n1898 on \" The Psychic Mechanism of Forgetting,\" in which failure\nof memory is explained upon principles of determinism. The\nunderlying idea is that just as dreams are an expression of the\n\"unconscious,\" so also does it strive for expression in absent-\nminded acts, slips of the tongue or pen, and in things erroneously\nrecalled, or resolutions carried out in a manner contrary to con-\nscious intention.\nIt is generally conceded that names tend to be forgotten more\neasily than any other content of memory ; but Freud examined\nthis phenomenon of temporary forgetfulness in the course of his\nanalytical researches. He concluded that, whether a name is\nmerely forgotten, or is replaced by a substitute, the displacement\nfollows definite natural laws, and is associated with repression.\nSometimes it is due to direct associations, but not infrequently\nto disturbances of the present theme by the ps}^chic relations\nof the theme which preceded it, \" for the disinclination to recall\nmay apply to one content of the theme, and yet the inability to\nremember may appear in another.\"\nForgetting is sometimes brought about by a deviation of atten-\ntion, due to inner conflict, in which outer association is formed\nbetween an idea and a repressed wish.\n\f412 Constance E. Long, M.D. [part\nOur social sense regards the forgetting of a name as a slight,\nfor we are supposed never to forget the name of a person who\nmakes a pleasing impression upon us.\nWe are sometimes induced to undertake an engagement against\nwhich we have resistances, and we are apt to accept it with a safe-\nguard, such as :\n\" I will do this, but I have a bad memory and\nyou must excuse me if I forget to turn up.\" No psychologist\nis surprised to find that engagements undertaken in this fashion\nfrequentty come to grief. An example of an omission which be-\ntrayed an unconscious intention is given in a letter from a pro-\nspective patient of Brill's. After some preliminary correspondence\nabout treatment he obtained an appointment. Instead of keeping\nit, (says Brill) he sent the following letter :\n\" '\nOwing to foreseen circumstances I am unable to keep my\nappointment.' He naturally meant to write unforeseen. He\nfinally came to me months later, and in the course of the analysis\nI discovered that my suspicions at the time were justified ; there\nwere no unforeseen circumstances to prevent his coming at that\ntime ; he was advised not to come to me. The unconscious does,\nnot lie.\"\nPrinters' errors are often explicable in the same way, but in\nFreud's examples the Editorial Department comes in for a large\nshare of responsibility. He tells the following story :\n\" An almost unbelievable example of miswriting and misreading\noccurred in the editing of a widely circulated weekly. It con-\ncerned an article of defence and vindication which was written\nwith nmch warmth and great pathos. The editor-in-chief of the\npaper read the article, while the author himself naturally read\nit from the manuscript and proof-sheets more than once. Every-\nbody was satisfied, when the printer's reader suddenly noticed\na slight error which had escaped the attention of all. There it\nwas, plainly enough :\n'\nOur readers will bear witness to the fact\nthat we have always acted in a selfish manner for the good of the\ncommunity.' It is quite evident that it was meant to read un-\nselfish. The real thoughts, however, broke through the pathetic\nspeech with elemental force.\"\nFreud, with his charming disregard of personal feelings in favour\nof analytical truth, tells of himself that he has occasionally attacks\nof migraine which are heralded by inability to recall proper names.\nFor this he does not allow himself the excuse of circulatory or func-\n\fLXIX.] Review. 413\ntional disturbance of the brain, but attributes such forgetting to\nthe same psychic forces that trip him up in health. He finds,\non analysing such phenomena, that the name withheld usually\ntouches some painful personal complex in himself.\nHe quotes an example of Jung's, showing the effect of a personal\ncomplex :\n\" Mr. Y. falls in love with a lady who soon thereafter\nmarries Mr.- X. In spite of the fact that Mr. Y. was an old acquain-\ntance of Mr. X., and had business relations with him, he repeatedly\nforgot the name, and on a number of occasions, when wishing to\ncorrespond with X.. he was obliged to ask other people for his\nname.\" Here the motivation for forgetting is obvious, aiid it\nis a direct result of Y.'s dislike for his successful rival,\u2014he wishes\nto blot him out.\nOur chance actions betray the state of our unconscious to such\nan extent that Freud prefers to call them \" symptomatic actions.\"\nThey give expression to something which the actor does not suspect\nin them, and which he has no intention of imparting to others.\nFor instance, a newly married lady after six weeks' honeymoon\nwas out shopping with her sister, when !1\nsuddenly she noticed\na man on the opposite side of the street ;\nnudging her sister\nshe said :\n'\nWhy, that is surely Mr. L.', forgetting that for some\nweeks this man had been her husband.\" Freud says :\n\" I was\nchilled by this tale, but I did not dare to draw any inference.\nThis little story came back to me several years later, after this\nmarriage had ended most unhappily.\"\nThese unintentional occurrences tend to complicate human\nrelations, and they explain some of the difficulties neurotic\npersons experience in living together. Such persons are exceed-\ningly sensitive to the \" symptomatic \" conduct of others, which\nthey understand to express change of feeling, or veiled hostility,\nand they are apt to be blind to similar lapses in themselves.\nIn the chapter on \" Determinism \", in which Freud states that\nif one is asked to select a number at random it is impossible to\ndo so \" by chance \", he gives several analyses to prove his state-\nment, the deductions from which will appear arbitrary to many\nreaders. Some phenomena of superstition also furnish examples\nof unconscious motivation. Superstitious persons find omens, not\nonly in external chance events, but also in occurrences brought\nabout by their own unintentional mental activity. Freud says :\n\" There are two differences between me and the superstitious\n\f414 Constance E. Long, M.D. [part lxix.]\nperson : first, he projects the motive to outside, while I look\nfor it in myself ;\nsecond, he explains the accident by an event,\nwhich I trace to a thought. What he considers hidden corre-\nsponds to the unconscious in me, and the compulsion not to let\nchance pass as chance, but to explain it, is common to both of\nus. Thus I admit that this conscious ignorance and unconscious\nknowledge of the motivation of psychic accidentalness is one of\nthe psychic roots of superstition. Because the superstitious person\nknows nothing of the motivation of his own accidental actions,\nand because the fact of this motivation strives for a place in his\nrecognition, he is compelled to dispose of them by displacing them\ninto the outer world. If such a connection exists, it can hardly\nbe limited to this single case. As a matter of fact, I believe that\na large portion of the mythological conception of the world, which\nreaches far into the most modern religions, is nothing but psychology\nprojected into the outer world. The dim perception (the endo-\npsychic perception, as it were) of psychic factors and relations\nof the unconscious was taken as a model in the construction of\na transcendental reality, which is destined to be changed again\nby science into psychology of the unconscious.\"\nThe book is full of pertinent examples, and should be read care-\nfully if justice is to be done to it. The subject is one which\nawaits further investigation, and it is open to Freud's critics\nto put his theories to the test, for absent-minded acts, omis-\nsions and forgetfulness are daily occurrences. It is, indeed, easier\nto apply psycho-analysis to our neighbours than to ourselves,\nbut what we discover in the psychology of another is rarely far\nfrom what is present in our own personality, though we\nlive so near to ourselves as to be very partial in our self-obser-\nvations.\nConstance E.

Verrall.\nIntroduction.\nThe experiments in thought-transference described in\nthis report have been conducted during the last two years\nunder strict conditions determined by the officers of the\nSociety for Psychical Research, and under their personal\nobservation and supervision. The percipient throughout\nwas Miss Louisa Tipping ; the agent in the first series\nof experiments was her sister, Miss Kathleen Tipping\n;\nin the second series I myself was the agent, and on two\noccasions there were two agents, Miss Kathleen Tipping\nand Mr. G. N. Tyrrell.\nAn account of some experiments in thought-transference\nbetween the Misses Tipping and Miss Hermione Ramsden\n2d\n\f416 Helen de O. Verrall. [part\nwas included in an article published in the Proceedings\n(see Vol. XXVII., p. 314), but the amount of success\nobtained in this series was not very large. Miss Louisa\nTipping and her sister had also tried some earlier ex-\nperiments together with interesting results. But these\nearlier experiments were conducted under less strict con-\nditions than those with which I shall deal here, and\ntherefore do not fall within the scope of this report.\nFor the same reason, in considering the question of\nthe success or failure of an experiment, I shall concern\nmyself here only with immediate success, that is to say,\nsuccess obtained during the actual course of the experi-\nment, under conditions which I shall presently describe.\nIn a good many instances after the percipient had gone\nhome, she got a deferred impression approximating more\nor less closely to the subject chosen for transmission.\nBut since she had in the mean time met the agent (her\nsister), the possibility of unconscious suggestion has to be\ntaken into account, and it is almost impossible to deter-\nmine how much allowance must be made for this factor.\nGeneral Conditions.\nIn all the experiments dealt with in this paper,\nthe agent and percipient were in different rooms, so\nthat there was no possibility in any case of indications\nbeing unconsciously given or unconsciously received as to\nthe subjects chosen for transmission. If, therefore, we\nconclude that the results cannot be explained by chance-\ncoincidence, we can hardly, I think, avoid the further\nconclusion that some telepathic faculty is involved. As\nto how far chance-coincidence will explain the results,\nopinions will probably differ. The problem is very\nsimilar to that which has to be faced in considering the\nquestion of cross-correspondences in automatic script.\nAt the conclusion of this report I shall put forward\ncertain considerations which seem to indicate that, after\nall due allowance has been made for chance, there still\nremains a margin of evidence suggesting that some other\nagency has been at work.\nIn each case the subject for transmission was chosen\n\flxx.] Some Recent Experiments in Thought-Transference. 417\neither by Miss Newton or by myself, with the exception\nof the two experiments in which Mr. Tyrrell was an agent,\nw\n2.\nMiss Johnson's\nRoom.\n\u2022\nW W\nMiss Verrall's\nRoom\nW w\nStairs.\n|Passage.\nLift.\n\\\nw\nMiss Newton's\nRoom.\nStore-room.\n\/\nw W' w\nLibrary and Office.\nW w\nPlan of S.P.R.

During\n\f418 Helen de G. Verrall. [part\nthe first four experiments the percipient was in some\nother part of London, and posted the record of her\nimpressions immediately after the experiment, before\nshe had seen the agent again. This arrangement was\nmade because we were anxious at first not to impose\ncompletely new conditions on the percipient.\nAll experiments after the first four were conducted\nentirely at the Rooms of the Society, the agent being in\none room and the percipient in another. These two rooms\n(marked 1 and 2 on the plan on p. 417, which is drawn\nto scale), are on opposite sides of the building and are\nseparated by a passage about ten yards long. The doors\nof both rooms were always closed during the experiments,\nand care was taken to avoid the possibility of the per-\ncipient obtaining by normal means any indication of the\nsubject which had been chosen. If we suppose that she\nreceived her impressions through any of the channels\nof sense, we must therefore assume her to be hyper-\naesthetic in a remarkable degree. We have no a priori\ngrounds for assuming this, and there seems to be nothing\nin the result of the experiments to suggest hyperaesthesia\nas a probable explanation.\nWhen Miss Kathleen Tipping was the agent, she was\nnever told what had been chosen as the subject of the\nexperiment until after she and her sister had parted. She\nsat in Miss Newton's room, and Miss Newton was always\npresent during the experiments. Miss Louisa Tipping, the\npercipient, sat in Miss Johnson's room, and Miss Johnson\nwas usually present.\nWhen I was the agent, I myself chose the subject for\ntransmission, except in the first two experiments, when\nit was chosen by Miss Newton. I sat in Miss Newton's\nroom (usually alone), and the percipient sat as before in\nMiss Johnson's room. When these experiments began\nMiss Louisa Tipping and I were not acquainted. After\nsome weeks, at Miss Tipping's suggestion, we met once\nin Miss Newton's room at the conclusion of an experi-\nment, and had about five minutes' talk. With this\nexception we never even saw each other during the\nperiod covered by these experiments.\n\flxx.] Some Recent Experiments in Thought-Transference. 419\nI will now give the detailed record of the experiments,\nas follows :\n(A.)

I get many objects of\nthe same shape. I can't make out if it is an orange, or\nsome kind of fruit with plenty of juice. I seem to be\ntasting fruit of some kind. L.

The latter part of the\nstatement is wrong. This result suggests that the per-\ncipient, having got a correct, but slightly blurred and\nincomplete impression of what the agent was doing, mis-\ninterpreted it.\nThis is a typical instance of the results which have\nbeen obtained in these experiments. Sometimes the per-\ncipient's impression approximates more closely to the\nsubject chosen for transmission\u2014sometimes less. Biit in\nalmost all cases in which any degree of success has been\nobtained, what the percipient seems to get is an impression\nof movement and of simple sensations, shape, colour, size,\nweight, position, texture and so forth. These impressions\nshe apparently combines by means of associated ideas\ninto a complex whole which may be very far from the\ntruth.\nExperiment III.\n(a) March 8, 1913. 11.15-11.35 a.m.\n20 Hanover Square, W.\nAgent. Miss K. Tipping.\nNote by Miss Newton. The subject of the experiment was a\nlong chain of beads of autumn colourings.

They seem to be living. Is it flowers in a vase ?\nYou, I think, are holding an ornament, and it is deep\nenough to hold things, pretty in shape and colour. I get\nbright, stimulating colour.

Tipping.\nThe percipient's impression is vague, but fairly correct\nas far as it goes, especially as regards the position of the\nagent \" close to the table,\" and the handing of a square\nobject to her from a shelf.\nFrom this time onwards the experiments were conducted\nentirely at the Offices of the Society, the agent and\npercipient being in different rooms. In future, therefore,\nonly the room in which each sat will be noted in the\nrecord.\n\flxx.] Some Recent Experiments in Thought-Transference. 423\nExperiment V.\nOn this occasion, contrary to the usual practice, the\nagent sat in Miss Johnson's room and the percipient in\nMiss Newton's room.\n(a) March 18, 1913. 11.35 a.m.-12.15 p.m.\nMiss Johnson's room.\nAgent. Miss K. Tipping.\nNote by Miss Johnson. The agent sat at the table arranging\na bunch of violets in a narrow green glass vase.\n. . . The violets bad very long stalks, as had also their\nleaves\u2014there were a good many leaves with them\u2014and Miss\nTipping cut the stalks of some. . . .\n(6) March 18, 1913. 1\nMiss Newton's room.\nThe object is standing on the table in front of you, you\ntouch it, but do not hold it. I get a fairly tall object,\nslim in shape, and colour rather light in tone. I see carving\nof some kind on it, sometimes it seems in the shape of\nleaves, and they stand off well from the flat surface of the\nobject. Is the object stone ? I feel it is hard, smooth,\npolished.\nI also get the form of a running figure, swift movement\n;\nit is a man's figure. This only comes faintly ; the object\nseems rather heavy for one to hold, so it stands in front\nof you. L. Tipping.\nThe first part of the percipient's impression as far as\n\" colour rather light in tone \" is correct, and it is note-\nworthy that again she is right as to the position and\nmovements of the agent in relation to the subject of the\nexperiment. The impression of carving is wrong, but it\nis interesting that this carving should appear to the\npercipient to be \" in the shape of leaves, and they stand\noff well from the flat surface of the object.\" This\n1 The percipient did not always note the time of day as well as the\ndate in her record, but in all cases she and the agent \"sat\" simul-\ntaneously, although sometimes the percipient continued the experiment\nfor a longer period.\n\f424 Helen de G. Verrall. [part\nimpression might easily be derived from a group of leaves\nin a vase, and Miss Johnson notes that \" there were a\ngood many leaves with [the violets].\"\nThe idea of carving apparently suggests to the percipient\nsomething of stone, which becomes defined as a statue\nor bas-relief of a running figure. This part of her\nimpression is wrong.\nExperiment VI.\nA Failure.\nMarch 19, 1913. 11.35 a.m.-12 noon.\nMiss Newton's room.\nAgent. Miss K. Tipping.\nSubject.

Miss K. Tipping.\nNote by Miss Newton. The agent and I discussed what to do.\nI suggested that she should lie on the sofa. I fetched a cushion\nfrom the office and placed it under her head. I gave her a\nblotting pad, a pencil and a piece of paper, and placed a\nlittle table at her side. She tried to transmit at home.\nMiss Jones brought in tea, a teapot, milk-jug, cup and saucer\non a tray, put it on the folding table and left the room. I\ncarried the tray and placed it on the table by Miss Tipping\nand poured out a cup of tea, telling her it was china. I\nleft the room and brought in another cup and saucer and\npoured out some tea for myself.\n{b) March 26, 1913.\nMiss Johnson's room.\nYou are holding the object and appear to move it about. I\nsee a smooth bright-looking thing, and I get reflections from\n\flxx.] Some Recent Experiments in Thought-Transference. 425\nthings near this object. I think it is hard, also a roundness,\nand I see black colour near to it. I feel a metal like silver,\nit is so bright and quite light in weight. L. Tipping.\n(c) Note by Miss Neivton. The percipient told me when I\nwent to her after the experiment that she had had a persistent\nimpression of a silver spoon and reflections of a face in it.\nWhen she told me this she did not of course know what\nthe experiment had been. She thought the impression was\ndue to her having seen, just before she left the boarding-\nhouse where she is staying, a new bright half-crown.\nThe agent told me after she knew that her sister had thought\nof a spoon and of reflections, that she had taken up the tea-spoon\nand looked at it, and also had noticed the reflections in the polished\nbrown tea-pot, but had dismissed the thought of the reflections\nfrom her mind. This and the attention given to the spoon were\nbut momentary impressions.\nThe percipient on this occasion had one persistent, im-\npression, derived apparently from a passing incident in the\nexperiment, which the agent had not consciously tried to\ntransmit. There have been several instances in earlier\nexperiments, in which the percipient's mind has apparently\nreflected the subconscious rather than the conscious\nthoughts of the agent (see e.g. Proc. 8.P.R., Vol. XXVII.\n,\npp. 309, 310).\nIt is, of course, a defect in the record that no mention\nof the tea-spoon occurs in the contemporary note on the\nsubject of the experiment, but Miss Newton's supple-\nmentary note was made immediately afterwards, when the\nagent's memory was still fresh in regard to her action with\nthe spoon.\nPerhaps the reason why the percipient's mind seized upon\nthis particular impression is that it was linked by association\nwith an idea already present in her mind, that of the silver\nhalf-crown which she had recently seen. Students of\nautomatic script will remember instances in which an\nidea normally engendered in the mind of the automatist\nhas formed the starting-point for a train of thought, sug-\ngesting some abnormal connexion with other scripts.\n\f426 Helen de G.

I then told her Mrs. Sidgwick had suggested she should open\nan umbrella. She agreed and said she had tried it once before,\n\flxx.] Some Recent Experiments in Thought-Transference. 427\nbut all that her sister got was an impression of her opening and\nclosing a fan. I suggested that she should dance round with\nan open umbrella. She laughed. I cleared away the table and\nbookcase. Miss Tipping opened and closed the umbrella for some\nminutes, and then I again suggested that she should dance.

The percipient sees \" an\nobject like a mushroom \" and the agent's arm, moving\nup and down. She actually interprets the mushroom-\nshaped object as an umbrella, but dismisses this inter-\npretation as due to the recollection of one of her own\ntoys. Then, casting about for some other interpretation,\nshe thinks of a small table-bell, the kind that is struck\nby hand, and her impression develops further on these\nlines into an object with reflections on it, which would\nbe a cold weight in the hand, is hard, and has a useful\nfeeling.\nExperiment XII.\n(a) April 3, 1913. 11.45 a.m.-12.10 p.m.\nMiss Newton's room.\nAgent.

When the percipient was asked at what time she got\nthe impression of wet hands, she said it was between 12 and\n12.5 p.m. She heard the clock strike twelve before she\nreceived the impresson, and when she looked at her watch\nafter the impression it was 12.5 p.m. From what she told\nme I gathered the impression was received about 12.3 p.m.\nI was careful to ascertain the time as near as possible, and\nit was not until after I had ascertained it that I remembered\nmy watch was fast, and comparing it with hers, found that\nmine was seven minutes in advance of hers.\nIt will be seen that the percipient's impression of wet\nhands corresponded in time almost exactly with the moment\nwhen the agent was washing her hands, since this occurred\nat 12.10 by Miss Newton's watch, that is to say, at 12.3 by\nthe percipient's watch. This was the only time in this series\nof experiments that the percipient had an impression of wet\nhands.

It\nstands on the revolving bookcase. Behind it, as a background\nto throw up the black shape, stands perpendicularly the\nlarge, brown-paper-covered atlas. Miss Tipping sat in the\nbasket-chair in front of the cat and looked at it, sometimes\nleaning back, sometimes sitting up. Generally one hand was\non her chin. I also tried to transmit the idea of a black\ncat, running along the passage to Miss Johnson's room, arching\nits back to be stroked, sprawling on the rug to be played\nwith, etc.\nMiss Tipping said she thought the object was more like a dog,\nand that she could not get away from that idea.\n{b) April 12, 1913.\nMiss Johnson's room.\nI have seen the face of a man, very handsome, with a heavy\nmoustache, hair on head inclined to be curly. This has come\nto me as a photo set in a small frame. It looks framed up with\nslight black or brown border of wood around it. My mind has\nbeen a perfect blank but for this one idea, and I have been very\nsleepy. I believe you held the object you send, and perhaps\nhave sat and gazed at it in front of you, but have not held\nit.

Tipping.\nWhen the percipient returned to the Secretary's room\nat the conclusion of the experiment, after the cat had\nbeen put away, she described to Miss Newton, who\nwas careful to say nothing to her about whether her\nimpression was correct or not, the portrait which she\nhad seen, and drew the sketches reproduced opposite\nto illustrate her meaning. The frame of the picture\nwas black, she said, with a cream mount. The waving\nlines she explained as representing the man's hair. It\nwill be seen that these lines are not unlike the cat's\nears. Moreover in the percipient's sketch of the \" por-\ntrait \" there appear some scrawls at the bottom repre-\nsenting the supposed title. The only legible letters\namongst these scrawls are G at the beginning, and t at\nthe end, whereas the word Cat was written under the\ncat. The description of the object photo set in\na small frame. It looks framed up with a slight black\nor brown border,\" is also appropriate. It is again as\nthough various disjointed impressions were correctly\nreceived, and then woven by the percipient's mind into\na coherent whole which is ludicrously wrong.\nThe following experiment, which was completely un-\nsuccessful, is printed at full length as a specimen\n:\n\f434 Helen de G.

They were planted in rings.\nThere are two points of interest in this experiment\n:\n(i) The percipient first has an impression of touching\nan object which is \" soft and very pleasing to look\non . . . slightly moist.\"\nThen she has an impression of an object which is almost\ncertainly a watch-bracelet (the subject of an earlier\nexperiment, see p. 420), and is described as \" shining\nand smooth . . . yellow in colour ... a golden circle,\netc.\"\n. Afterwards these two impressions coalesce apparently\ninto an impression of an object which \" seems to have\nlife.\" \" My fingers feel as if you had touched something\ncold and moist, yellow in colour, smooth.\"\nThis impression was perhaps suggested by the yellow\nwallflowers which the agent touched, and which, as Miss\nNewton noted after the experiment, were planted in\ncircles.\n(ii) The percipient had an impression of an outdoor\nscene, a country-scene evidently, since she speaks of it\nas expansive with \" not many trees \" and \" a very\npeaceful feeling.\" This impression was appropriate, seeing\nthat the agent had been sitting in a garden. She and\nMiss Newton were careful when they went out to walk\nquietly and not to speak in the passage, so that the\npercipient should have no normal knowledge of their\nhaving left Miss Newton's room. This was the only\ntime that the agent left 20 Hanover Square during the\nexperiment, although on one later occasion she went\n\f438 Helen de G. Verrall. [part\nup on to the roof (May 3, 1913).

On the table was a small dark green\nbox and a piece of string. The box contained the slides,\nwhich Miss Tipping took out one by one and inserted in the\nstereoscope, and looked at through the peep-hole. The candle\nwas short and flamed and smoked occasionally.

It has been in\nmy mind this morning (I thought of it just before the experi-\nment) that I must not forget to buy some cherries for dessert\nthis evening, as I have a friend dining with me.\nH. de G. Verrall.\n\flxx.] Some Recent Experiments in Thought-Transference. 447\nThe percipient had two impressions this time, (if we\nignore the impression of \" small letters,\" which is of very\nfrequent occurrence and upon which no emphasis is laid\nhere), one of \" little white things,\" the other of small\nround objects, red in colour, identified as cherries. After\na time, as often happens, there is contamination between\nthese two impressions, but at first they are quite distinct.\nThe impression of cherries may be due to the fact that\ncherries had been prominently in my thoughts that morn-\ning, as stated above. But upon that point one cannot\nlay much stress, as cherries had not been the subject of\nthe experiment. The other impression is more interesting.\nIt is an impression \" of little bits of white, very soft in\ntexture,\" which the percipient wishes to pick up and\nplace in order ; I seem to her to move these white things\nabout, my fingers seem very busy. She has a persistent\ndesire to count the things I am touching.\nThis impression seems to me very much what we might\nexpect to find, if we suppose that my actions and sensa-\ntions, as I sat crocheting, were conveyed to the percipient\npiecemeal, bereft of all meaning and coherence. The\ncolour is there, the texture of the material, the idea of\nmaking a pattern, placing things in order, the constant\nmovement of my hands, and the persistent counting,\nwhich is not the counting of a definite sum total of\nthings. She says :\nI felt all the time I wanted to count. I felt I must ask :\nhow many are there in front of you ? I don't know how to\nexpress it. There were so many, too many to count, and yet\nthey were countable. I think Miss Verrall moved them.\n* Experiment XXVII.\n(a) June 11, 1913. 11.20-11.50 a.m.\nMiss Newton's room.\nAgent.

Verrall.\n(6) June 11, 1913. 11.20 a.m.\nMiss Johnson's room.\nAre you thinking of a puzzle ? Because I have seen little\nthings of many shapes, some like this, (Drawing of shapes)\nqueer shapes and yet you could put them in order, and they\nwould mean something. I got different colours. I want to\npick these things up, and place them again. It would require\nthought, and a good eye for measurement. I get a feeling\nof wanting to space things out. You look down at what you\nare trymg to send me, and your hand goes ovit and picks\nup these queer little shapes. They appear to me to lie quite\nclose to you, all mixed up, and you sift them for a certain\nshape. Whatever you are doing takes up your attention much.\nI feel most serious and attentive, quite puzzled.\nThe objects appear to be of a hard texture ; it is the\ndifferent shapes which attract me. I think you have thrown\nthem out of a box or some kind of square thing which has\nheld them. These objects are different on the upper and\nlower surface ; the shape is the same, but there is something\non the one side which makes an alteration.\nThen once I felt you were cutting things out in paper with\na pair of scissors, shapes like these (Drawing of shapes)\nbecause I wanted to out up things with you. I feel much\ndesign about what you are trying to send through. Also I\nwondered once if it was a message to me, because these words\ncame very clearly :\n\" It will come.\" Letters of some kind.\nHave you spoken out loud to yourself about what you are\nsending, because I thought once I heard words and wanted\nto listen. This feeling went very quickly, it seemed to me\njust like the end of a whisper.\nBut the chief thought is about the queer little shapes, a\nfeeling as if they were connected with some sort of puzzle.\nL. Tipping.\nNote by Miss Johnson. Miss Tipping gave this writing to\nme about 12.15 p.m., then stood and thought further, and at\nintervals made various remarks which I wrote down, not quite\nverbatim, as follows :\n\flxx.] Some Recent Experiments in Thought-Transference. 449\n\" It seems like different things that could be put together\nto make a pattern, things of different shapes. I don't want\nto count them as the other day. They were lying in a heap\ntogether and she took them out and placed them.\nI distinctly saw a message, letters, '\nit will come.'\nThe strongest impression was the puzzle. Things different\non the two sides, like playing cards, all cardboard, they express\non their surfaces different things.\nShe seemed to be very intent on what she was doing. Just\na flutter of words, you could hardly catch it, the faintest\nwhisper, such a flutter. She's spoken something out.\"\n(c) Note added by the agent after seeing the percipient's\nstatement. The cards were in a cardboard case. It is there-\nfore correct to say that I threw them \" out of a box or some\nkind of square thing which has held them.\"\nH. de G. Verrall.\nThe first part of the percipient's statement is obviously\na description of a jigsaw puzzle. The allusion to the\nqueer shapes of different colours and different on the two\nsides, which are to be sifted out and put in order, makes\nthis clear.\nBut many of the percipient's remarks are equally\nappropriate to my action during the experiment :\nAre you thinking of a puzzle ? . . . I want to pick these\nthings up and place them again. It would require thought\n. . . I think you have thrown them out of a box, or some\nkind of square thing which has held them. These objects\nare different on the upper and lower surface . . . there is\nsomething on the one side which makes an alteration.\nAfter a fleeting impression of cutting out paper, ob-\nviously derived from the earlier impression of the \" queer\nshapes,\" the percipient returns to the idea of the puzzle,\nwhich she finally sums up in the words recorded by Miss\nJohnson, who did not at the time know the subject of\nthe experiment :\nThings different on the two sides like playing cards, all\ncardboard, they express on their surfaces different things.\n\f450 Helen de G. Verrall. [part\nEven here the objects seen are not identified with\nplaying-cards, they are only said to be like them ; but\nit should be noted that the words \"all cardboard,\" which\nare applicable to cards, are not applicable to a jigsaw\npuzzle, which is always made of wood.\nThe percipient was evidently strongly impressed with\nthe idea that the things she saw were different on the two\nsides ; she returns to this idea more than once. My own\nrecord shows that I was consciously aware of this pecu-\nliarity in playing-cards, for I noted that \" the cards had\nbacks with a pattern in light and dark green.\"\nIt is again as though the percipient received a series\nof correct but disjointed impressions, which at first she\nmisinterprets. Afterwards this misinterpretation is partly\ncorrected.\nExperiment XXVIII.\nA Failure.\nJune 12, 1913. 11.25 a.m.-11.55 a.m.\nMiss Newton's room.\nAgent. Miss Verrall.\nSubject.

I first saw it as though you held a\nsmall form in your hand, and then it seemed lying in your\nlap, first in one position and then in another. The slanting\neyes were the first thing I felt in this figure, then came the\ndark hair, and afterwards the colour and form of a face. I\nfelt whatever you held in your hand was light in weight, and\nthat it was clothed. I get light bits of colour splashed on a\ndark ground-work, easy and flowing in design, but this does\nnot attract me much, just a detail in the object you hold.\nThe face is the strongest thing and that I see most clearly.\nI sense an unusual feeling in what you are doing. I don't feel\nanything spread in front of you, but that it is one object.\nYou pick up, hold, turn it round, and then place it on your\nlap.

Verrall. [part\n(c) Note made by the agent after seeing the percipient's state-\nment. The bowl used in this experiment was a small bowl of\noriental china, about three inches in diameter at the rim.\nInside at the top was a narrow border of blue and red flowers,\nand a circle of similar flowers at the bottom. Between the\ntwo, on the sides of the bowl, were three red and blue butter-\nflies. H. de G. Verrall.\nWith regard to the percipient's first impression, the\nJapanese doll, I have no explanation to offer. Her\nsecond impression appears in several particulars to reflect\nthe ideas that I was trying to convey.\n(i) The percipient says that she sees gold-fish in a bowl,\nor something that holds water, and she wants to wet her\nfingers. The subject of the experiment on this occasion\nwas a bowl, and during the experiment, as I have noted\nin my contemporary statement, \" I considered the question\nof filling the bowl with water, but decided not to do this.\"\n(ii) In speaking of the gold-fish the percipient says :\nNot many gold-fish but little objects moving round . . .\nI think they must be gold-fish. I can see them moving\nso swiftly round and round. I want to keep making circles.\nAnd immediately afterwards, in conversation with Miss\nJohnson, she speaks of \" the fish, or whatever they were,\ngoing round and round.\"\nWith these impressions should be compared my note :\nI held it [the bowl] in one hand for some time and passed a\nfinger of the other hand round and round the rim. I also\nlaid the bowl on its side on the table and rolled it round and\nround.\nPerhaps \" the little objects moving round \" which the\npercipient identifies, rather doubtfully, with gold-fish, were\nsuggested by the three butterflies painted on the inside\nof the bowl.\n\fLXX.] Some Recent Experiments in Thought-Transference. 453\nExperiment XXXI.\nA Failure.\nJune 20, 1913. 11.35 a.m.-12.5 p.m.\nMiss Newton's room.\nAgent.

N. Tyrrell, the second agent, is an associate of the\nSociety for Psychical Research, and was not at the time\nacquainted with the Misses Tipping.

The agent chose two subjects for\nthis experiment. From 11.57 a.m. to 12.7 p.m. he sat and\nlooked at a diagram, drawn in black ink on a white ground,\nas below :\nHe also copied this diagram.\n\flxx.] Some Recent Experiments in Thought-Transference. 455\nFrom 12.7 to 12.17 p.m. the subject of the experiment was\n\"CLARENCE, in gold letters on a red brick house outside.\"\n(b) May 11, 1914. 11.57 a.m.\nMiss Johnson's room.\nFirst impression. Silver, metal. [Drawing of a circle.]\nMoney. Silver.\nI think you have written something on paper for me, or\nyou have done drawing of some kind. I wish to draw, or\nmake figures. I have felt numbers, or rather a number, 12,\ncolour black and white. L. Tipping.\nThe percipient's impressions are interesting on this\noccasion, because they seem to some extent to reflect the\nthoughts of both agents, the idea of silver being perhaps\nderived from the polishing of Miss K. Tipping's umbrella-\nhandle, and the idea of drawing in black and white\nfrom Mr. Tyrrell's diagram. The percipient's impression\nof the number 12 was perhaps suggested to her by the\nfact that the time was then just about 12 noon ;\nvery\nprobably she had heard a clock strike.\nNeither here nor in the previous experiment does the\npercipient's record show any consciousness of there being\ntwo agents, and although on the second occasion the\nresult was not unpromising, it was thought better for\nthe moment at any rate to follow a simpler line of experi-\nment and therefore on subsequent occasions there was only\none agent.\nAs to the question of how far these results may be\nattributed to chance-coincidence it is not possible to come\nto any exact conclusion, because the experiments do not\nadmit of statistical analysis. As regards certain types\nof impression a good deal of allowance would undoubtedly\nhave to be made for chance, because the percipient\nexhibits in these experiments several mental habits. For\ninstance, she has an impression of letters or printing no\nfewer than sixteen times out of thirty-four, and on six\noccasions she has an impression of flowers. But it will\n\f456 Helen de G. Vcrrall. [part\nbe noticed that in none of the more successful experi-\nments do these recurring ideas play an important part.\nIf we left them out of account entirely, our estimate\nof the success would hardly be affected.\nCritics may be inclined, again, to suggest that where\nthe resemblance between the percipient's impression and\nthe subject chosen for transmission is only of a general\ncharacter,\u2014a question of the attitude and gestures of\nthe agent, or of the shape and colour of the subject,\n\u2014\nchance-coincidence might account for most of the resem-\nblances.\nWith a view, however, to testing, as far as possible,\nthe quantity and quality of the coincidences that might\nhave been produced by chance in this series, I con-\nstructed out of it an artificial series by comparing each\nof the percipient's impressions with the subject (a) of\nthe succeeding experiment, (b) of the next experiment\nbut one, (c) of the next but two, obtaining thus a series\nof ninety-six imaginary \" experiments.\" Since the date\nof the percipient's impression in each case preceded\nthe date of the subject chosen for comparison, it might\nbe assumed that any coincidence which occurred in this\nartificial series was due to chance. If the dates had\nbeen reversed, it might be supposed that the coincidences\nwere due to deferred telepathy.\nIn judging the amount of coincidence in this artificial\nseries, I tried to maintain approximately the same standard\nas I have applied to the genuine experiments discussed\nabove, and I therefore began by discounting slight, vague\ncoincidences which seemed mainly due to what I have\ncalled the percipient's mental habits. Amongst these\nninety-six results I found five partial coincidences,1\ni.e. a\nproportion of one in nineteen, as compared with nine\nout of thirty-four, i.e. one in four in the real experiments.\n1\nCompare, e.g., III. (a) with II. (b) and XVII. (a) with XIV. (b).\nIn Experiment XXVI. I made crochet lace in white cotton and in\nExperiment XXIV. the percipient had an impression that I was knitting\nwith white or grey wool. This is the only one of these five coincidences\nwhich is at all striking. I will ask the reader to take the other two\n\" on trust,\" since they occur in experiments of which the detailed record\nis not included in this paper.\n\flxx.] Some Recent Experiments in Thought-Transference. 457\nSo far, therefore, as any conclusions can be drawn from\nthis test, there seems to be a considerable margin of\nevidence for supposing that some other agency than chance\nhas contributed to the result of these experiments, and\nas I have said' hi my introduction, it is difficult to see\nwhat this other agency can be but thought-transference.\nAfter the conclusion of the experiments which I have\ndiscussed here, Miss Louisa and Miss Kathleen Tipping\ncarried out another short series of experiments, in May and\nJune 1914, in which the subject was usually a playing-\ncard or diagram upon which the agent fixed her attention.\nIn this series of experiments there was only a very small\namount of success. The Misses Tipping are both under\nthe impression that more success is likely to be attained\nwhen action of some kind is involved in the subject of\nthe experiment, and the results hitherto observed in this\ncase bear out this impression. It may be, of course, that\nthe higher degree of success attained in a particular\ntype of experiment is due to expectation and auto-sugges-\ntion, but two other explanations may be suggested :\n(a) Any one who has ever played the part of agent in\nexperiments of this kind will recognise what a great help\naction of almost any kind is towards continuous mental\nconcentration. Indeed, for most people it is almost\nimpossible to keep the attention fixed upon a single mental\nconcept for more than a very short period of time.\n(b) In carrying out action of any kind many sub-\nconscious nerve-centres, both motor and sensory, are\nstimulated. If, as we have some reason to think, the\nsubconscious mind plays an important part in thought-\ntransference, it may be that the stimulation of these\nnerve-centres helps in the transmission of ideas.\nIt is not possible to draw any certain conclusions from\nsuch a small number of experiments as are here discussed,\nbut we hope before long to carry out further experiments\nwith Miss Louisa Tipping, and perhaps with other per-\ncipients. As the amount of material increases, it may\ngradually become possible to form some theory as to what\nconditions are most favourable to thought-transference.\n\f458 Hereward Carrington\n.\n[part\nII.\nA DISCUSSION OF THE WILLETT SCRIPTS. 1\nI.\nBy Hereward Carrington.\nIn the opinion of Mr. Gerald W.

If we begin by assuming this,\nwe are apt to make all the evidence fit into our theory.\nLet us, rather, judge the scripts purely impartially, without\nassuming that they emanate from Dr. Verrall or from any\nother disembodied \" spirit.\" It seems to me that those\nwho have studied these scripts have not done this ;\nthey\nseem to have been almost determined from the start to\nplace the authorship with Dr. Verrall ; for we read (p. 224) :\n\" it had indeed from the first been supposed to be connected\nin some way with the late Dr. Verrall.\" Why ? Because\nthe script of July 6 contains two lines from a poem of\nChristina Rossetti's, whose subject is death, and Dr. Verrall\nhad died \" only a few weeks before !\n\" Surely the S.P.R.\nwill invite very adverse criticism as to its methods if it\nadvances evidence of this sort, and then proceeds to build\nup elaborate theories and an immense superstructure upon\n\flxx.] A Discussion of the Willett Scripts. 461\nso flimsy a foundation as this ! Let us see if there is not\nanother interpretation of the script\u2014one quite in confor-\nmity with the facts, and perfectly obvious, when once\npointed out.\nBefore discussing this alternate interpretation, however,\none fact must not be lost sight of ; and that is the fact that\nthe enigmatic, studied, veiled and obscure form of the\nwriting affords no evidence, per se, of its genuinely spiritistic\ncharacter. We know full well that planchette and auto-\nmatic writing will often assume this form, when there is no\nevidence whatever that any external intelligence is active-\n\u2014\nother than the subliminal of the medium. This \" dramatic\nplay \" is effective, but it affords a strong argument against\nthe spiritistic theory just as much as it does for it. The\nbeautiful cases brought forward by Flournoy, in his work\nSpiritism and Psychology, fully demonstrate this, and indi-\ncate the lying character of many of these communica-\ntions. Here, as we have seen, messages of a precisely\nsimilar character were received from supposedly \" dead \"\npeople who afterwards turned up alive and in good\nhealth ! Facts of this character should give us pause,\nand make us decide to discard absolutely all evidence for\nsurvival based upon this \" dramatic play.\" Evidence\nmust be forthcoming that the knowledge shown over-\nreaches the possibilities of the subconscious mind. The\nsupernormal is the criterion. This fact was very clearly\nseen and insisted upon by Prof. Hyslop, when he said\n{Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XVI., p. 292) :\nThe crucial test of Spiritism, in this and all other cases,\nmust turn upon the question of telepathy to furnish the data\nupon which any secondary consciousness has to work. Until\nit is more fully studied, we shall have to assume that second-\nary personality is equal to the task of explaining the dramatic\nplay of person ality, and all non-evidential data, and base our\nconclusion upon the insufficiency of telepathy to supply the\nobjective facts in evidence of personal identity.\nThis has been more and more borne out by the publi-\ncation of late facts. We must make up our minds,\ntherefore, to discard all \" dramatic play \" as non-evidential,\n\f462 Hereivard Carrington. [part\nin the strict sense of the word, and judge the scripts\nsolely upon the basis of the supernormal information they\ncontain.\nJudged in this light, and from an entirely unbiassed view-\npoint, what do we find ?\nIt seems perfectly obvious to me that the symbolic re-\nferences to crossing a river, the pilgrim hesitating upon its\nbrink, etc., refer not to Dr. Verrall at all, nor to any classical\nwriter ; but to a book which practically everyone has read,\nand which may be calculated to leave an indelible and life-\nlong impression upon the subliminal of every reader\u2014to\nwit, Pilgrim's Progress. The word \" Pilgrim \" is distinctly\nreferred to on several occasions\u2014the actual word being\nused. We are also specially warned not to confuse this\nPilgrim with the Passionate Pilgrim (which would steer us\noff, into Shakespeare) nor to \" H. S.'s.\" In other words,\nthe script refers in a veiled way to a certain passage in\nwhich a Pilgrim comes to a river which he hesitates to\ncross, and which may be assumed to refer symbolically to\nDeath. Now, in Pilgrim's Progress, Death is aptly repre-\nsented by a deep river without a bridge, separating the\nbeliever from his heavenly inheritance\u2014as Jordan flowed\nbetween Israel and the promised land. Let me quote the\npassage to make this perfectly clear\n:\nNow I further saw that betwixt them and the gate was a\nriver ; but there was no bridge to go over ; the river was\nvery deep. At the sight therefore of this river, the pilgrims\nwere much stunned ; but the men who went with them said,\n\" You must go through or you cannot come to the gate.\"\nThe pilgrims then began to inquire if there was no other\nway to the gate ? to which they answered, \" Yes ; but there\nhath not any, save two, to wit, Enoch and Elijah, been\npermitted to tread that path since the foundation of the\nworld ; nor shall until the last trumpet shall sound.\" The\npilgrims then (especially Christian) began to despond in their\nminds, and looked this way and that, but no way could be\nfound by them, by which they might escape the river. Then\nthey asked the men if the waters were all of a depth ? They\nsaid, \" No ;\n\" yet they could not help them in that case\n;\n\flxx.] A Discussion of the Willett Scripts. 463\n\" for,\" said they, \" you will find it deeper or shallower, as\nyou believe in the King of the place.\"\nThey then addressed themselves to the water, and, entering,\nChristian began to sink, and crying out to hi& good friend\nHopeful, he said, \" I sink in deep waters ; the billows go over\nmy head, all his waves go over me. Selah.\"\nThe passage then goes on to describe Christian's further\nagonies of soul in crossing, and his final triumphant emer-\ngence upon the further shore.\nI think we need surely go no further in our search\nfor the origin of this script. We have all the necessary\nconditions fulfilled. Assuming Mrs. Willett to have read\nPilgrim's Progress, or to know the story, we have here,\nit seems to me, a complete explanation of the origin of this\npart of the writing.\nWe have a Pilgrim (not the Passionate Pilgrim of\nShakespeare nor H. S.'s)\u2014crossing a river\u2014the river of\ndeath. It is beautifully symbolized. He hesitates and\ndoubts before crossing. He sees the stream and is afraid.\nHe dislikes to battle with the current and the water's\nprobable depth. It would \" prove interesting \" upon\nidentification, because it refers to Death, symbolically. It\nis not Rossetti's. Truly, \" you cannot miss that Inn,\"\nbecause all men must die ! The passage is as clear as\npossible throughout. The writing is a mere subliminal\nre-construction of this story of Christian crossing the\nriver of Death\u2014portrayed in the usual veiled manner.\nNeither Statius nor any classical author whatever is referred\nto ; nor is reference to them necessary to explain the\nscript fully and satisfactorily.\nTo pass to other portions of the script. In that of\nAugust 13, we have \"Faith and . . . Hair ... in a\nTemple.\" Now, I should imagine that the automatic\nhand, wandering on in its usual dreamlike way, started\nto write \"Faith and Hope,\" but after writing the H of\nthe word Hope, it suddenly took a \"new turn\" and\nwrote \" Hair in a Temple.\" I have seen many similar\ninstances of this, in which the meaning of the phrase\nhas been suddenly turned in this manner, after the first\n2 G\n\f464 Hereward Carrington. [part\nletter of a word has been given. It is a common trick\nof the subliminal. Just why \" Hair in a Temple \" should\nthen have been written, I am, of course, unable to say.\nIt seems mere dream-like rambling. Mr. Balfour says it\nhas a hidden and very intimate and subtle connection\nwith Dr. Verrall\n\u2014\ntoo intimate and subtle, unfortunately,\nfor publication ! Not knowing the facts, I cannot dispute\nthis. As, however, I think I have shown that neither\nDr. Verrall nor Statius were in any way referred to in\nthe foregoing script, I think we need not concern our-\nselves very greatly with this connection, which thus\nassumes a very far-fetched aspect.\n\" Lavender and Lub \" would be a good hit, were it\nnot for the fact that this phrase had already appeared in\nMrs. Verrall's script, and had been seen by Mrs. Willett\n(]). 236). If, therefore, Mrs. Willett had any intimation\nthat her script was thought to emanate from Dr. Verrall\n\u2014which she might well have subconsciously surmised\nfrom the actions of her sitters\u2014her subliminal might well\nhave inserted this phrase, amidst her writings, as it was\nknown to be intimately connected with Mrs. Verrall\n(it appeared in her writing) and hence indirectly with her\nhusband. The phrase does not appear remarkable to me\nat all.\nAs to the drawing of a wheel, amid many drawings\nand diagrams which have occurred in the automatic writing\nin the past\u2014many of them unrecognizable\u2014this should\nnot occasion us much concern ! It might represent the\nWheel of Fortune ; the wheel of a Chariot (spoken of at\nthe next sitting) ; the Wheel of Time ; the Wheel upon\nwhich Mercury is sometimes represented as standing, etc.\nIf the latter, it would follow very naturally from the\nsentence before it\u2014speaking of a Temple. (I myself have\nseen a dome-like building, resembling a temple, surmounted\nby a winged Mercury, standing upon a wheel.) This\nwould seem, therefore, to represent a pure piece of symbolic\nimagery.\nFinally, as to the passages relating to the \"one-horsed\ndawn \" and \" Dante,\"\u2014inasmuch as these had already\nbeen the subject of lengthy discussions in the Proceedings,\n\fLXX.] A Discussion of the Willett Scripts. 465\nI am inclined to attach no weight whatever to them, but\nto regard these references merely as stray shots\u2014referring\nto incidents which could not fail to hit the mark in one\ncapacity or another. Any reference whatever to Dante\nwould be held to have significance\u2014after all that has\nbeen written upon him in the past ! It has no real\nconnection with the script, but is merely a stray shot,\na line thrown out, to see whether or not it would find\nsoil. The fact that it did so is evident from the paper of\nMr. Balfour, and the tremendous superstructure of theory\nwhich the Rev. M. A. Bayfield has reared upon this slender\nnumber of facts !\nReviewing the evidence, therefore, from a purely im-\npersonal and impartial point of view, we see that it by no\nmeans points to Dr. Verrall as the author of the scripts ;\nand that no vast amount of classical scholarship is involved\nor necessary to understand or interpret them fully. They\nrepresent, rather, the piecing together of disjointed fragments\nof subconscious knowledge and subconscious memories ;\nthey have no systematic connection, and point to no\n\" spirit \" as their author. They are all fully explained\nupon purely psychological and naturalistic lines. And\nthis criticism applies, it seems to me, not only to the\nWillett scripts in particular, but to almost the whole\nof the cross-correspondences. Studied in this manner,\nand without prepossession, they almost invariably resolve\nthemselves into simple subconscious memories and associa-\ntions, between which no real connection whatever exists.\nI believe, with Dr. Maxwell, that the evidence afforded by\nthese cross-correspondences has been vastly over-rated ;\nthat chance has played a far greater part than is usually\nassumed ; and that the evidence for survival which they\nfurnish is distinctly inferior in all respects to the straight-\nforward communications supplied in the Hodgson and\nHyslop reports, from which method many of us are sorry\nthe Society has ever departed. I also agree fully with\nMrs. Anna Hude {The Evidence for Communication) in\nthinking that, while there is strong evidence for supernormal\nknowledge of a vague kind shown by these cross-references,\nthere is practically no evidence of \"spirit return,\" and\n\f466 Hereward Carrington. [part\nthat the Latin message incident, far from being a success,\nwas a miserable failure. It is with regret that I record\nthese impressions, which are doubtless opposed to those of\nmany other members of the Society ; but they have been\nreached only after a thorough and painstaking examination\nof the evidence. I cannot help feeling that these com-\nmunications lack nearly all the essentials necessary to\ninsure conviction ; and that the spiritistic hypothesis still\nrests for its most solid support upon the G. P. sittings,\nand other \" direct \" communications coming through Mrs.\nPiper. The whole crux of the question lies there.\nII.\nBy Ivor Lloyd Tuckett, M.D.\n[The following remarks by Dr. Tuckett, who is not a\nmember of the S.P.R., are taken from a letter he wrote in\nOctober, 1914, to a member who had asked his opinion about\nthe Willett scripts, and who suggested that his answer should\nbe published. This is now done with Dr. Tuckett's permission.\n\u2014Ed.]\nThe Willett script published in Part LXIX. of the\nProceedings is a less oppressive case for discussion than\nmost cases of automatic writing, especially those that\nare supposed to form a cross-correspondence, such as the\n\"Alexander's Tomb \" C. C. analysed by Miss Johnson, which\ndoes not impress me with the necessity for a supernormal\nexplanation but which it is difficult to grasp and criticise\nconcisely. So this Willett script, in as far as it is not\nsupposed to be part of a cross-correspondence, deserves,\nto my mind, more serious attention and is more impressive.\nBut it is only impressive if you agree with Mr. Balfour\nthat the Willett script of July 6, 1912 (written in Mr.\nBalfour's presence eighteen days after Dr. Verrall's death\non June 18, 1912) finds its solution in a passage from\nDr. Verrall's essay, entitled \" Dante on the Baptism of\nStatius,\" published in the Albany Review in August, 1908,\n\flxx.] A Discussion of the Willett Scripts. 467\nbut probably quite unknown to Mrs. Willett. Mr. Balfour,\nwho has written the article in the Proceedings of the\nS.P.R. with considerable skill, is too ready, I think, to\nassume that it does find its only solution in Dr. Venull's\nessay. Therefore, as Mr. Balfour's argument depends\nalmost entirely on identifying the passage asked for in\nMrs. Willett's script with a passage in Dr. Verrall's essay,\nI must discuss this matter at some length.\nThe script of July 6, 1912 (see above, p. 458) ends\nwith a quotation from a poem called Uphill, the subject of\nwhich is Death.\nNow in this script there is obviously quite as much\nstress laid on the idea of an Inn as there is on that\nof River ; and there is also some mention of battling\nwith the current. Then the quotation of Christina\nRossetti's poem rather implies that the passage referred\nto occurs in a poem. Consequently I do not think the\npassage in Dr. Verrall's essay more appropriate than\nmany other passages either in classical literature about\ncrossing the Styx, or in hymns about trembling on the\nbrink of the river of death ; while in modern poetry\nthere must be many passages which would fit well enough.\nWhy should it not even be some passage from Dante\n(for the script of September 8, 1913, contains the words,\n\" What moves the stars and all the heavenly bodies ?\nDante makes it clear.\") rather than the passage in Dr.\nVerrall's essay, which runs as follows :\nThis river [i.e. of baptism] he long hesitated to pass ;\nhe \" halted on the other side,\" as a man, who was no hero,\nmight, when to be baptised was to be in danger of death,\n\u2014\nthough, as he tells us, the delay cost him centuries of expiation\nupon the purgatorial mountain. But before he brought his\nArgives to the Asopus [i.e. in his poem of \" The Seven\nagainst Thebes \"] he himself had made his passage.\nHere there is no reference, explicit or implicit, to an Inn,\nand nothing about battling with a torrent. In Dr. Verrall's\nremarks on Statius, the stress is on the danger he ran after\ncrossing the river of baptism rather than on any danger in\ncrossing, the point accentuated in the script.\n\f468 Ivor Lloyd Tuckett, M.D. [part\nIn the next place, Mr. Balfour tries to clinch the matter\nand convince the reader that this is the passage referred\nto in the script by writing (p. 220) :\nThe fact that this essay brings into conjunction Dr. Verrall\nhimself, Dante and a traveller or pilgrim who hesitates to cross\na river, is to my mind almost convincing proof that it contains\nthe passage we are looking for. But any doubt that may still\nremain will vanish, I think, before one decisive consideration\nWhen Statius, in the lines of which I have already read\na translation\n\u2014\n[i.e. Purgatorio xxii., 73-91]\u2014says to Virgil,\n\" Through thee I was a poet, through thee a Christian,\" he\nadds, \" but that thou mayest the better see what I outline, I will\nput forth my hand to fill in colour.\" Dr. Verrall quotes these\nlines and explains them to mean that Dante himself felt that\nhis account of the manner and date of Statius' conversion\nrested on an imaginative interpretation of the passage in the\nThebaid on which he was relying, and went considerably beyond\nits literal meaning. Now turn to the printed extract from the\nWillett script of July 6, 1912 :\n\" What the passage does not\nsay I draw from my own mind to make the connection clear.\"\nWe have here an unmistakable paraphrase of the very words\nthat Dante puts into the mouth of Statius. And what I will\nagain ask you specially to note is that this crowning proof\nthat the passage has been correctly identified occurs in the\nearliest of the four scripts that refer to the subject.\nHere you see Mr. Balfour talks about a crowning proof.\nBut to my mind the occurrence in Mrs. Willett's script\nof words which are more or less a paraphrase of some\nlines in the Purgatorio do not prove anything at all. If\nthe inspirer of the script, supposed by Mr. Balfour to be\nDr. Verrall, had wanted to make the script refer to a\npassage in Dr. Verrall's essay and at the same time to\nbring in a reference to Dante's mention of Statius in the\nPurgatorio, he would have attained his end with certainty,\nnot by using words which are only a vague paraphrase of\nDante's words, but by quoting Dante's words themselves\nin the Italian or at any rate the English translation, viz.\n\" but that thou mayest the better see what I outline,\nI will put forth my hand to fill in colour.\"\n\flxx. I\nA Discussion of the Willett Scripts. 469\nThe expression \" I will put forth my hand to fill in\ncolour \" would have been a millionfold more convincing\nthan saying, \" What the passage does not say I draw\nfrom my own mind to make the connection clear.\" These\nlatter words might be applied to so many contexts, and\nare not uncharacteristic of the vague, non-committal\nutterances of automatic script.\nThen again Mr. Balfour's words, \" The fact that this\nessay brings into conjunction Dr. Verrall himself, Dante\nand a traveller or pilgrim who hesitates to cross a river,\nis to my mind almost convincing proof that it contains\nthe passage we are looking for,\" are to my mind point-\nless. For if we do not assume that Dr. Verrall is the\ninspirer of the script, then the fact that any passage\nbrings into conjunction Dr. Verrall, Dante and a Traveller,\ndoes not make that passage any more probably the one\nreferred to in the script. Mr. Balfour here is obviously\narguing in a circle. He assumes the identity of the\npassage to prove that Dr. Verrall inspired it, and he\nthen makes a point of Dr. Verrall being the inspirer to\nprove the identity of the passage.\nAltogether I am absolutely unconvinced that the script\nabout the Timid Traveller refers to the passage in Dr.\nVerrall's essay ; and if it does not, then there is nothing\nimpressive about the script. In all cases of automatic\nwriting I see no reason yet for doubting that what is\nwritten could be given a normal explanation, if we knew\nall about the conscious thoughts and subconscious material\npresent to the automatic writer's mind in the hours or\ndays preceding the production of the script. Nevertheless,\nI admit the possibility that some day convincing evidence\nof communications from discarnate minds may be forth-\ncoming ;\nalthough in this particular case I regard the\nevidence for Dr. Verrall's interference as very weak.\nNext a few remarks about two subsidiary points.\n(1). \"Lavender or Lub,\" which came at the end of\nscript B (August 13, 1913), and which Mr. Balfour\nsupposes were words \" introduced to serve as an identify-\ning symbol connecting Dr. Verrall with the script by a\nlink the significance of which was outside the normal\n\f470 Ivor Lloyd Tuckett, M.D. [part\nknowledge of the automatist,\" had occurred in a script\nof Mrs. Verrall written on January 13, 1908. Mrs. Willett\nhad seen this script ; so the occurrence of the expression\nin her own script requires no supernormal explanation.\n(2). In scripts B, C, and especially in D, quite as much\nor more stress is laid on \"HAIR IN A TEMPLE \" than on\nthe passage referring to a Timid Traveller. If the expres-\nsion involves private matters, it is unfortunate for the\nsupernormal explanation ; but Mr. Balfour's words are of no\nscientific value when he says he thinks it refers to Catullus'\npoem on \" The Hair of Berenice,\" and adds, \" I must ask\nyou to accept from me that there is a connection, but\none which I have to leave unexplained, because it involves\na reference to private matters which I am not at liberty\nto disclose. ... I can only tell you that '\nBerenice\n'\nis, as a matter of fact, connected by very definite inter-\nmediate links with Dr. Verrall's essays on Dante and\nStatius, and that this explanation has the additional merit\nof explaining why the drawing of a wheel appears in the\nscript of August 13, 1913.\"\nI regard it as almost scientifically illegitimate to use\nthe words as a matter of fact ; and it is certainly scientifi-\ncally pointless to mention Berenice's Hair at all, if the\nevidence cannot be given. So for the ordinary reader\nof the Proceedings there is nothing to show from the\noccurrence of the words \" Hair in a Temple \" in three\nscripts out of four that the passage referred to in the first\nscript has anything to do with Dr. Verrall's essay entitled\n\" Dante on the Baptism of Statius.\"\nFinally, I feel I ought to make some general remarks\nabout the whole incident.\n(I.) It is noteworthy how prejudiced Messrs. Balfour\nand Bayfield are in favour of the Verrall origin of the\nscript. They do their best to make the passage in Dr.\nVerrall's essay, entitled \" Dante on the Baptism of\nStatius,\" fit the words of Mrs. Willett's script without\nconsidering and discussing the claims of any other passages\nin modern and ancient literature about a river which\nsome one hesitated to cross, such as Caesar and the\nRubicon, or Christian crossing the river to Paradise in\n\flxx.J A Discussion of the Willett Scripts. 471\nThe Pilgrim's Progress ; and then they triumphantly argue\nthat the inspirer of the script was much more probably\nDr. Verrall's discarnate mind than the automatist's own\nmind, or some other incarnate mind acting telepathically\non the automatist.\nN.B.\u2014It is amusing to note how seriously the Rev.\nM. A. Bayfield discusses whether Dr. Verrall or some\nform of telepathy is the more probable explanation of the\nscript ; and talks as if he knew a great deal about\nTelepathy, although\u2014as I continue to maintain\u2014Telepathy\nitself has never yet been scientifically established. In\nthis discussion, too, I note that he refers, as evidence for\ntelepathy, to the scientifically worthless experiments of\nMiss Miles and Miss Ramsden which gave such feeble\nresults.\n(II.) Even if I admitted that there was no doubt of\nthe connection between the script and Dr. Verrall's essay\nand that apparently Dr. Verrall was the inspirer of the\nscript and that there was here some evidence for the\nsupernormal, yet then I should try not to forget that\nthis was a single experiment ; and that, in the light of all\nthe twaddly, worthless automatic writings and utterances\nwhich have been given forth during the last 2000 years,\ngreat caution must be exercised. For in studying pheno-\nmena taking place under vague, unknown conditions, with\nthe possibility of all sorts of unforeseen fallacies, the only\nway to approach truth is by establishing a percentage of\nstriking results out of a large mass of phenomena, of very\nlow scientific value individually. And the percentage is\nremarkably low ! Yet the Rev. M. A. Bayfield in his\nNote on the Same Scripts says that this incident has quite\nconvinced him of the reality of \" communication with the\nspirit world.\"\n(III.) The Rev. M. A. Bayfield's note on the incident\nis remarkably characteristic of the sort of effect which\nemotional bias has on a person. What has convinced him\nmuch more than any sound scientific evidence is obviously\nthe form of the script in which he thinks he can recognise\npersonal peculiarities of Dr. Verrall. This reminds me\nstrikingly of the trial of the French spirit-photographer,\n\f472 Ivor Lloyd Tuckett, M.D. [part\nBuguet (see Podmore's Modern Spiritualism, Vol. II.,\np. 120), at which witness after witness came forward to\ntestify on behalf of the accused, having obtained unmis-\ntakeable photographs of those dear to them ; and they\nwould not relinquish their faith, even when they heard\nBuguet explain how he had taken all the photographs with\n\" a headless doll or lay figure, which, variously draped,\nserved for the body of the ghost. The head was commonly\nchosen to suit expectations. . . . The lay figure and a\nlarge stock of heads were seized by the police at the\nstudio.\"\nIn short there is no evidence apt to be more deceptive\nthan the recognition of traits and peculiarities which we\nthink characteristic of those we have known well and\nloved. The emotional bias subconsciously making one\nwish to be convinced is so strong. Even the recognition\nof Russians whom we have never loved can be fallacious, if\nthe bias is strong enough !\nIn this case the Rev. M. A. Bayfield lays stress on the\ncharacteristically impatient tone of the Willett script. But\nfrom his remarks it is clear that, if the script had been\nremarkable for the patience shown, it would have been\nequally easy to say this was characteristic of the patient\nfortitude with which Dr. Verrall bore his long illness.\n(IV.) There is nothing in Mrs. Willett's script which\nis not characteristic of automatic writing. Now as we\nknoiv that automatic processes in some cases have been\ninspired by forgotten memories or by a subconscious\ntrain of thought\u2014I could give four or five examples from\nMiss Johnson's first paper on Mrs. Holland's script, \u2014the\nnatural attitude, apart from special reasons, is to find\nthe explanation of every script in the automatist's own\nmind. (In this case identification of the references to\na Timid Traveller with Dr. Verrall's essay would con-\nstitute a special reason ;\nbut, as I have shown, this\nidentification is not convincing.) Moreover, the year's\ninterval between scripts A and B is quite characteristic of\nthe way subconscious processes, masquerading as a per-\nsonality, go on. We must always remember that Mrs.\nWillett was at the time an intimate friend of Mrs. Verrall\n\flxx.] A Discussion of the Willett Scripts. 473\nand her daughter, and knew all about their hopes of what\nautomatic writing would prove, besides having read many\npapers published by the S.P.R. Consequently, Mrs. Willett\nprobably knew quite well, subconsciously, the sort of\nevidence which would impress members of the S.P.R.\n,\nand how this sort of puzzle of referring vaguely to some\npassage and then returning to the subject a year later\nwould excite interest.\n(V.) All that we know about the mind and its relation\nto the brain from the researches of physiologists and\nexperimental psychologists goes to show that you cannot\nget out of the mind anything the elements of which\nhave not been put into the mind at some previous time.\nThe mind can evolve wonderful combinations out of\nsubconscious material, but there is no evidence that it\ncan produce thoughts quite outside the range of the\nthinker's experience. For instance, there is no evidence\nthat an automatist can speak or write a language which\ncan be shown with certainty never to have come within\nthe horizon of the automatist's experience. Consequently,\nthe hypothesis that Dr. Verrall inspired Mrs. Willett 's\nscript can only mean that Dr. Verrall's discarnate mind\nwas able to select and utilise elements which were present\nin Mrs. Willett's subconscious mind ; but the Rev. M. A.\nBayfield, in discussing the telepathic hypothesis, himself\ndenies that there is any evidence that one mind can rout\nabout in another person's mind. On the other hand, if\nthe discarnate Dr. Verrall was more than a mere selector\nof the script, his mind must have got possession of the\nworking of the automatist's brain, a hypothesis which\nraises endless difficulties.\n(VI.) Mrs. Willett only knew Dr. Verrall slightly. So\nif Dr. Verrall wanted to send a communication to show\nthe S.P.R. that his mind still survived, he could have\ndone it so much more easily\u2014one would think, knowing\nnothing about the supernormal conditions under which\nautomatic writing might occur\u2014through his wife or\ndaughter. Or, if he wanted to make his communication\nas convincing and striking as possible, one would expect\nhim to have chosen some complete stranger. Mrs. Willett\n\f474 Ivor Lloyd Tuckett, M.D. [part\nstrikes me as being neither intimate enough nor enough\nof a stranger for it to be probable that Dr. Verrall\nwould have chosen her for his medium of communication.\nHowever, I really consider ib is futile to discuss what is\nprobable in a hypothesis for which there is no evidence ;\nand I attach no weight to this argument. So I have\nput these remarks last in case they may appeal to any\nspiritistically inclined readers.\nIII.\nBy the Rev. M. A. Bayfield.\nI have been asked to make a reply to the two papers\nwhich immediately precede this, and will endeavour to do\nso, dealing in such detail as seems to be required with\nthe criticisms which they offer. We will take Mr. Carring-\nton's paper first.\nHe writes on p. 460, \" they seem to have been almost\ndetermined from the start to place the authorship with\nDr. Verrall ; for we read (p. 224) '\nit has indeed from\nthe first been supposed to be connected in some way\nwith the late Dr. Verrall.' Why ? Because the script\nof July 6 contains two lines from a poem of Christina\nRossetti's, whose subject is death, and Dr. Verrall had\ndied 'only a few weeks before'!\" But Mr. Balfour's\nwords, \" it [the script] had indeed from the first been\nsupposed to be in some way connected with \" afford no\nwarrant for Mr. Carrington writing, \" they seem to have\nbeen almost determined from the start to place the author-\nship with.\" Further, in order to show that the supposed\nconnexion was not altogether arbitrary (as Mr. Carrington\nsuggests that it is), Mr. Balfour goes on to say, \" This\nbeing the first script she had written since Dr. Verrall'\ns\ndeath, it was natural to expect that reference to him\nwould be made in it.\" Any one familiar with the subject\nknows that this is the way of automatists, and also that\nthe fact imports nothing as to the ultimate origin of the\n\flxx.] A Discussion of the Willett Scripts. 475\nscript. To maintain that Dr. Verrall is referred to in the\nscript is totally different from maintaining that he is the\nauthor of it ; the critic, however, appears not to have\ngrasped the distinction, and he omits Mr. Balfour's im-\nportant sentence. Mr. Balfour immediately adds a stronger\nreason for the connexion :\n\" Moreover, a phrase in this\nsame script '\ndoes she remember ' was reminiscent of a\nsimilar phrase in which '\nshe ' clearly alluded to Mrs.\nVerrall.'' This point also Mr. Carrington ignores and\nomits ; but clearly Mr. Balfour's two reasons, given in full\nand taken together, explain satisfactorily enough why it had\nbeen supposed that Script (A) was \" connected in some way\nwith the late Dr. Verrall.\" Even if Mr. Carrington does\nnot find these reasons satisfactory, he might note that\nthough the supposition was seriously entertained, this was\nin spite of the fact that it left any connexion of the\n\" passage \" with Dr. Verrall still a complete mystery.\nMr. Carrington comments on his own version of Mr.\nBalfour's arguments as follows :\n\u2014\" Surely the S.P.R.\nwill invite very adverse criticism as to its methods if it\nadvances evidence of this sort,\". . . Fortunately the\nSociety is in no way responsible for offering '\nevidence of\nthis sort ' in support of spirit intervention, nor is even\nMr. Balfour ; it is a hors d'ceuvre of Mr. Carrington' s own\npreparation. The evidence Mr. Balfour advanced on this\npoint is merely evidence that the scripts referred to Dr.\nVerrall, and has nothing to do with the question of the\nlatter's authorship or agency.\nNext we are warned to attach no importance to the\n'\ndramatic play ' in the scripts, since it is by no means\nbeyond the capacity of the unaided subliminal conscious-\nness. That is a truth familiar to babes in psychical\nresearch, and since Mr. Balfour showed no forgetfillness\nof it, one wonders why it was thought necessary to\nemphasise the axiom in the present connexion. The\ntopic is quite irrelevant. May I be pardoned for wonder-\ning\u2014merely wondering\u2014whether, by some confusion of\nthought, the writer had in his mind my Note on the\nextraordinary characterisation of Dr. Verrall (with its\ndramatic features) which the scripts present ? If this\n\f476 Rev. M. A. Bayfield. [part\nis so, it is to be remarked that the two things are not\nthe same. The characterisation of an individual is\nquite distinct from the ordinary dramatic play which\noccurs so commonly in scripts, and which is referred\nto in Mr. Carrington's quotation from Dr. Hyslop's\narticle.\nMr. Carrington identifies the passage referred to in\nthe scripts as being Bunyan's description of the pilgrims\ncrossing the River of Death ; he says the identification\nis \" perfectly obvious.\" The passage in The Pilgrim's\nProgress is so familiar, and the superficial similarity\nbetween the passages so obvious, that the idea is probably\nthe first that would occur to anyone on a first glance\nat the scripts ; and as a matter of fact it was the first\nthat occurred to those who first saw the scripts. They\nrejected it because a second glance showed the proposed\nsolution to be untenable for the following reasons.\nFirst, all the scripts emphasise the single traveller,\nand never mention more than one ; in Bunyan's allegory\nthere is a crowd of people on the river bank, who are\ndescribed as all being concerned to make the crossing and\nas proceeding to attempt it, and two pilgrims, Christian\nand Hopeful, pass over together.\nAgain, Script (A) describes the river in question as a\n\"torrent,\" and speaks of the traveller as \" disliking to battle\nwith the current.\" Now, this is in precise and remarkable\nagreement with the condition of the river Asopus as\ndescribed in the essay. Dr. Verrall's words, which follow\nthe description of Statius, are, \" The unfriendly stream, we\nare told, then chanced to be swollen by a formidable\nflood, and the Argive horsemen hesitated to pass.\" 1\nIt\nwas the strength and speed of the river, now become a\ntorrent, which dismayed them, and it is natural and reason-\nable to suppose that if Dr. Verrall assigned in his thoughts\nany particular characteristics to the metaphorical river of\nStatius' baptism (the river of the script, as we think), it would\nbe those of the Asopus in flood, since it is the Asopus\nin that condition which furnishes the image. Bunyan's\n1\nSee Literary Essays Classical and Modern, p. 195, and Statius, Theb.\nvii. 425 ff.\n\flxx.] A Dismission of the Willett Scripts. 477\nriver, on the other hand, appears to have had no appreciable\ncurrent. In fact its pace was no part of his thought ;\nthe\nonly feature and the only difficulty he is concerned to\npresent is the depth of the water. At its first mention the\nriver is said to have been \" very deep,\" and a little later\nthe pilgrims are told that they \" will find it deeper or\nshallower \" according to their faith ; and that is all that\nis said of the character of the stream.\nA still more decisive objection than these is that this\nsolution boldly ignores the various hints given in the\nlater scripts as a help towards identification of the passage\nin the first. Mr. Carrington arbitrarily and impatiently\ntosses these aside, and says with the finality of a Judicial\nCommittee of the House of Lords, \" It [any reference\nto Dante] has no real connection with the script.\" Now\nassertion is not argument, as Mr. Carrington is well aware,\nand since he is engaged in a serious discussion to which\nhe must desire to do strict justice, he cannot be '\nbluffing\n'\nhis readers ; no honest seeker after truth would do that.\nWe are bound, therefore, to suppose that he has some\nsound reasons for this wholesale elimination of the refer-\nences to Dante, though he keeps them to himself,\u2014that\nhe possesses some touchstone by which he can infallibly\ndistinguish the material from the immaterial. But why\nthis sudden and unexpected reticence ? To raise our\nexpectations of a reasoned treatment of this cardinal\npoint and then leave us unsatisfied is, to say the least,\nunkind. Also I am afraid he cannot have realised how\nimportant these allusions to Dante are for Mr. Balfour's\nview ;\nelse, with his desire to be studiously fair to the\ndiscussion and to guide us aright, he would have told\nus plainly why, like \" the flowers that bloom in the\nspring, tra la,\" they \" have nothing to do with the\ncase.\" As it is, deserted by our guide, we shall go on in\nour own stupid way, believing that these allusions are\nintentionally inserted as helps towards identification of\nthe propounded passage.\nMoreover, as against Mr. Carrington's view, if the\npassage in Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress is the true answer\nto the riddle, what plausible explanation can be given of\n\f478 Rev. M. A. Bayfield. [part\nthe words of Script (A), \" Should it be possible to identify\nthis passage, the matter would prove interesting \" 1\n\" Should it be possible \" is a phrase which suggests some\ndifficulty in making the identification, but the incident in\nBunyan's story leaps to any literary person's recollection\nat once. And if the passage of Bunyan had had any\n\" interesting \" association with Dr. Verrall, Mrs. Verrall\nwould almost certainly have been aware of the fact, and\nwould have told us. On the other hand, if the \" passage\n\"\nof Script (A) is the passage in the essay on Statins,\n\" the matter \" does \" prove interesting,\" for it furnishes\nstrong evidence of personal identity and survival.\nLet us, having no reason to the contrary, take into\naccount the allusions to Dante, and let us for the moment\nassume that Mrs. Willett's subliminal alone, and in pure\nmischief, concocted the scripts. She begins by pro-\npounding the problem in Script (A) ; but the little jest\nfalls flat, for nobody makes any guess at the answer,\nthough she waits for a whole year. The words \" What\nthe passage does not say,\" etc., were not at that time\nrecognised as a paraphrase of two lines of Dante. She\nis naturally piqued, and propounds her riddle again in\n(B), this time adding hint the word ' wheel ' and\nthe drawing of a wheel. This hint also is too obscure\n;\nfor though there is a famous wheel in the Divina Corn-\nmedia, there are also others, as Mr. Carrington observes.\nAccordingly there are still no bids. So in (D) she returns\nto the subject once more, and this time with the pointed\nhint \" Dante makes it clear.\" After that, those few who\nhad seen the writings offered their answer to the puzzle,\nand the subject disappeared from Mrs. Willett's scripts.\nApparently her subliminal was satisfied. On the assump-\ntion with which this paragraph begins, this view of\nthe scripts seems to be natural and indeed inevitable.\nOn any view of the origin of the scripts it is merely\nperverse to separate the references to Dante from the\npropounded passage ; and this will, I think, be the\ngeneral opinion until Mr. Carrington sees fit to impart\nthe secret of his patent separator. One wonders what\nhe himself would have said of such a dislocation if\n\fLXX.] A Discussion of the Willett Scripts. 479\nanyone had ventured upon it in order to support a case\nfor spirit intervention.\nHow dangerous it is to form a judgement about the\nallusions in script without taking every detail into account\nis well shown in the case of the following scripts written\nby Miss Verrall. Though they extend over a period of\nsix years they are apparently all connected. I have\nitalicised the words which alone belong to the poem that\nwas finally identified as being the one intended :\n(1) Dec. 16, 1907.\u2014. . .

It was right about the boat.\n(8) Feb. 25, 1914.\u2014. . . Did you understand about the silver\nmasts ? that was important\u2014the mice too were to identify\n\u2014\nI mean for identification of the ship . . . the ship is what\nmatters . . .\nAfter much hunting, Mr. Piddington had identified the\n2h\n\f480 Rev. M. A. Bayfield. [PAET\npoem as being The Fairy Ship, a child's poem which\nbegins :\n\u2014\n\" A ship, a ship a-sailing, a-sailing on the sea,\nAnd it was deeply laden with pretty things for me ;\nThere were raisins in the cabin and almonds in the hold,\nThe sails were made of satin, and the mast it was of gold.\nThe four and twenty sailors that stood between the decks\nWere four and twenty white mice, with rings round their\nnecks ...\"\nThere are other versions, and in one the sails are, it is\nsaid, of silver.\nProbably few people would dispute the correctness of\nthis identification, which, it should be added, was arrived\nat by Mr. Piddington entirely without prejudice, for he\nhas no idea why the poem in question was referred to\nby the scripts. But if no notice had been taken of the\nmice, which in (2) and (5) appear to be altogether irrele-\nvant, the true solution would certainly have been missed.\nThus Miss Verrall herself thought that Hood's poem\nbeginning, \" A lake and a fairy boat, To sail in the\nmoonlight clear,\" might possibly be intended. Only\nwhen it was plainly said in (6) that \" the crew were\nmice \" was it seen that all previous guesses had been\nerroneous. None the less, should this identification ever\nbe used to support a case of spirit intervention, we must\nnot be surprised if some one gifted with mysterious\npowers of penetration comes forward and boldly declares\nthat the mice have \" no real connexion with the script,\"\nthat each one of them \" is merely a stray shot, a line\nthrown out, to see whether or not it would find soil \"\u2022\n\u2014\nand bear no doubt those fantastic fruits that we so often\nsee when shots and lines strike root. Any one who can\nignore Dante would make short work of three blind mice,\nor even a crew of them.\nThese scripts of Miss Verrall furnish a further lesson,\nwhich may be useful to those who have only made a\nsuperficial study of automatic writing. They illustrate the\ndifficulty which the subliminal not infrequently seems to\nfind in expressing simply and directly the idea which it\n\flxx.] A Discussion of the Willett Scripts. 481\napparently wishes to convey. It will lead up to it by\nindirect approaches, or wrap it round with confusing\nsuperfluities, or even\u2014betrayed by some literary or other\nassociation\u2014introduce a fresh thought similar yet distinct,\nso that the reader is puzzled to decide which idea is\nthe important one. For instance, in (2) above, we get\nat the mice of the fairy crew only through \" three blind\nmice,\" and these themselves are led up to by the carv-\ning knife.\nAgain, such irrelevances may be introduced by the\nautomatist's conscious self : realising what she is writing,\nshe may start a train of associated thought which some-\nhow finds its way into the script, either at the time or\nlater. Thus the description of the fairy boat in (1)\nintroduces moonlight and a star, neither of which occurs\nin the poem. The moonlight is borrowed from Hood's\npoem, and the star comes from an illustration of it\nwhich Miss Verrall had seen, and which shows a star\nat the boat's prow. I may add in passing that the\nforegoing remarks have a bearing on the mention of\nthe Inn in Mrs. Willett's Script (A), which will be dealt\nwith below.\nThe references to \" Hah in a Temple \" Mr. Carrington\nexplains in a manner apparently satisfactory to himself,\nbut which is mere imagination. He is, of course, not\nin a position to offer, or even form, any opinion on this\npoint, and he would have impressed us more as a dispu-\ntant if he had contented himself with saying that the\ncourt could take no notice of statements unsupported\nby evidence. Mr. Balfour's opinion on the matter (pp. 239 f.)\nhas weight with many of us, but one would not expect\nimportance to be attached to it by anyone who did not\nknow his impartiality in judging of such questions. The\nreader may be reminded that his mention of the point\nwas independent of his main argument, and that he did\nnot offer it as any part of the evidence in support of that\nargument.\nThe remarkably strong point \" Lavender or Lub \" is\nsimilarly dismissed with a mere wave of the hand\u2014and a\nfalse statement. For the phrase was not, as Mr. Carrington\n\f482 Rev. M. A. Bayfield. [part\nasserts, \" known to be intimately [the italics are mine]\nconnected with Mrs. Verrall \"\n(p. 464). It had appeared\nonce in a script written by Mrs. Verrall on January 13,\n1908, which, among a large number of others, had after-\nwards been seen by Mrs. Willett, and that fact is all Mrs.\nWillett could have known about it. As will be seen by\nreference to Mr. Balfour's footnote on p. 237, \" Lub \" (the\nessential word in the Willett script) is in Mrs. Verrall's\nscript solely due to the accidental emergence of a sub-\nliminal memory, through association with \" Lavender \"\n\u2014\none of thousands of such emergences, and there is nothing\nin the script to suggest any connexion of this phrase with\nDr. Verrall. Yet a critic who comes before us as one not\nto be convinced on important matters without compelling\nevidence, can on these facts satisfy himself that Mrs.\nWillett having \" subconsciously surmised from the action of\nher sitters \" [my own italics] that \" her script was thought\nto emanate from Dr. Verrall,\" \" her subliminal might\nwell have inserted this phrase amidst her writings, as\nit was known to be intimately connected with Mrs. Verrall\n. . . and hence indirectly with her husband.\" That is\nto say, he is ready to believe that, though Mrs. Willett\nhad seen enough of Dr. Verrall to remember many things\nconnected with him, she reproduces a casual and meaning-\nless expression that had once emerged from Mrs. Verrall's\nsubliminal when writing automatically, in order to give\ncolour to the suggestion that Dr. Verrall is the author of\nher own script. It is a curious example of believing against\nall probability what one wishes to believe.\nMr. Carrington's mention of sitters, it may be added,\nis a mere assumption, for he could not know that there\nwere more than the one mentioned by Mr. Balfour. In\nany case, it was made clear in Mr. Balfour's paper\n(pp. 236-7) that Mrs. Verrall was not present. As a\nmatter of fact there was one sitter only, Mr. Balfour\n;\nbut he, as he states, \" was unable [with regard to the\nphrase Lavender and Lub] to form any conjecture\nrespecting its meaning or appropriateness \" in connexion\nwith Dr. Verrall.\n\fLXX.] A Discussion of the Willett Scripts. 483\nDr. Tuckett, unlike Mr. Carrington, has not made up his\nmind to any particular identification of the passage pro-\npounded in Script (A). Apparently almost any passage\nthat refers to the crossing of a river would satisfy him,\nif only that passage were not in the essay on Statius,\nor did not for other reasons lead to a spiritistic explana-\ntion.\nHe begins by stating that in the script \" there is\nobviously quite as much stress laid on the idea of an Inn\nas there is on that of River.\" Any one acquainted with\nthe idiosyncrasies of automatic writings\u2014and it is dangerous\nto offer judgements on them without such acquaintance\n\u2014\nwould have written not \" obviously \" but \" apparently,*'\nremembering that appearances are deceptive. As we saw\nin the case of Miss Verrall's scripts quoted above, it is\nquite possible for a topic to be introduced which is\nforeign to the main theme of the script, and neglect of\nthis possibility may result in a complete misunderstanding\nof the script's point. As therefore we found no difficulty\nin eliminating the \" moonlight \" and the \" star at the\nprow \" from Miss Verrall's script after the poem referred\nto had been securely identified, so here, if we believe we\nhave good grounds for identifying the river with one on\nwhose banks there is no inn, we need not hesitate to\nsuppose the inn to be an irrelevance which has crept\nin through some mental association. The association of\ntravellers and inns is both familiar and natural. The fact\nis, supposing spirits do communicate, few communications,\nit would seem, are reproduced in script without '\ncon-\ntamination.' 1\nThe imparted thought is liable to be im-\nperfectly grasped or to receive additions as it passes\nthrough the medium's brain ; it may be coloured, decorated,\nor otherwise modified in various ways, and foreign ideas\nmay be interpolated between two or more connected\npieces in the same script. This view of the matter\nseems to be warranted by the facts, and since the point\nhas been discussed from time to time in our publications,\n1\nFor an instructive instance of this contamination in the case of\ntelepathy from the living, the reader is referred to the ixovuttwXov es aw\nincident reported in Proceedings, Vol. XX., pp. 156-167.\n\f484 Rev. M. A. Bayfield. [part\none would have thought it would not be ignored by any\none who ventures to write on the main question.\nThis \" Inn,\" irrelevantly intruded (as I believe) in the\nhrst paragraph of the script, has perhaps been responsible\nfor the introduction of the quotation from Christina\nRossetti's poem and the idea of death. However this\nmay be, what is certain is that both the Inn and the\npoem, with the latter's associations of death, are dropped\nentirely from the later scripts, while the other itemsj|of\nthe description are persisted in and amplified.\nIt is somewhat startling to find that Dr. Tuckett,\nnotwithstanding the importance he would attach to the\npresence of the Inn, is prepared to identify the river\nwith the Styx or the Rubicon, or the river in The Pilgrim's\nProgress (!), or a river hi some hymn or in \" some passage\nfrom Dante.\" My acquaintance with Dante is not suffi-\nciently precise to enable me to affirm on the point, but I\nshould be much surprised to find in his works mention\nof a river with an inn on its bank. Without referring to\nmy copy, I hazard the assertion that Bunyan does not\nplace an inn on the heavenly bank of the River of Death,\nor indeed on either. I am sure there is no mention of\nan inn in any hymn, and I do not think Greek or Latin\nliterature mentions one on the banks of the Styx or\nRubicon. It may be added that the passage of the Styx,\nso far from inspiring alarm, was made with ease and\ncomparative comfort. The stream was sluggish, and the\npassengers were ferried over in a punt by an old man,\nwhom they sometimes mobbed in their eagerness to get a\nplace. Also, always supposing there had been no oversight\nor other mishap, each of them had in his (or her) mouth\nthree halfpence with which to pay the fare.\nIt may be freely admitted that possibly there is \" some\npassage from Dante \" which would fit the case as aptly as\ndoes the passage from Dr. Verrall's essay, but it has not\nbeen found. Perhaps the critic will suggest one. If\nhe can bring himself to accept the concession, mention of\nan inn shall not be a sine qua non.\nAs his final words on this topic, Dr. Tuckett writes,\n\" In Dr. Verralls remarks on Statius the stress is on the\n\flxx.] A Discussion of the Willett Scripts. 485\ndanger he ran after crossing the river of baptism rather\nthan on any danger in crossing, the point accentuated\nin the script.\" One wonders what he himself would\nhave said if an opponent had descended to this quibble.\nThe paper next deals with the argument which Mr.\nBalfour bases on the words, \" What the passage does\nnot say I draw from my own mind,\" etc. Or rather,\nthough some observations are made on the words, there\ncan hardly be said to be any attempt to deal with the\nargument. Dr. Tuckett admits that the words are \" more\nor less a paraphrase \" of Dante's lines, but complains\nthat the poet's actual words (in Italian or English) were\nnot given in the script. A wise inspirer of scripts would\nhave given them, and they \" would have been a million-\nfold more convincing.\" But the objection quietly evades\nthe point at issue. If the words are really a paraphrase\nof the lines in Dante, they are altogether as effective\nas the original, for they guide us to the passage in which\nthe original occurs\u2014and that is all that quotation of\nthe poet's actual words in the Italian would have been\nintended to do. One wonders what it is that has blinded\nthe critic to this obvious fact ? And how far are truth\nand serious discussion served by dismissing the matter\nwith this weak and pointless observation :\n\u2014\" These latter\nwords [those of the paraphrase] might be applied\nto so many contexts, and are not uncharacteristic\nof the vague, non-committal utterances of automatic\nscript \" ?\nThat the sentence in the script is a paraphrase of\nDante's lines I am personally unable to doubt. I did\nnot see the scripts until a few minutes before the meeting\nat which Mr. Balfour's paper was read, when one of\nthe slips on which they had been separately printed for\nthe convenience of the audience was put into my hands.\nI at once began to read Script (A). The moment my eye\nfell on the words now in question they recalled the two\nlines of Dante. For reasons here immaterial I happened\nto have a peculiarly thorough acquaintance with the essay\non Statius, but had last seen it twelve months earlier\nand some ten months before I heard of the existence of\n\f486 Rev. M. A. Bayfield. [part\nthe scripts. Moreover, I knew nothing of Mr. Balfour's\npaper beyond the broad fact that it would endeavour\nto establish some connexion between the scripts and the\nessay ; it was the paraphrase alone which evoked the\nmemory of the lines.\nOn the whole question Dr. Tuckett accuses Mr. Balfour\nof arguing in a circle (see p. 469), but the accusation\nfalls flat. The argument may be summarized thus. A\ncertain script, which probably (or more probably than\nnot) has reference to Dr. Verrall, propounds a passage in\nliterature for identification. Later scripts written by the\nsame automatist present features which, apart from any\nfancied identification of the proposed passage, leave little\nroom for doubt that the writer at any rate has Dr.\nVerrall in mind throughout (Conclusion (a) ). On the\nother hand, independently of any presumption that Dr.\nVerrall is referred to in the scripts, various hints in the\nscripts lead to identification of the propounded passage\nas being a passage in a certain essay (Conclusion (b) ).\nThis essay happens to have been written by Dr. Verrall.\nIf there had been reason to think that Dr. Verrall had\nnot even heard of the essay, then conclusion (b) would\nreceive no support from (a), and vice versa ;\nconsidering\nthe subject matter with which wc are dealing, each\nmight even be thought to weaken the other. But since\nDr. Verrall is actualty the author of the essay, each of\nthe two independent conclusions is sensibly strengthened\nby the other ; there is mutual confirmation. To combine\nthe two conclusions is not the fallacious process known\nas \"arguing in a circle,\" but a legitimate completion of\nthe circle of the argument.\nIn his remarks on subsidiary points Dr. Tuckett dis-\nmisses \" Lavender or Lub \" in two sentences which betray\nsomewhat . misty thinking. The phrase had a peculiar\nand special connexion with Dr. Verrall, and Mr. Balfour\nnoted that the significance of this link with him was\noutside the normal knowledge of the automatist. If Dr.\nTuckett had shown us that the scripts one and all had\nno reference to Dr. Verrall, or that \" Lavender or Lub\n\"\nhad no meaning in connexion with him\u2014whereas he has\n\fLxx.] A Discussion of the Willett Scripts. 487\nattempted neither\u2014it would have been to the point to\nsay that, since Mrs. Willett had seen the script of Mrs.\nVerrall in which the words occur, \"the occurrence of\nthe expression in her own script requires no supernormal\nexplanation.\" Of course the mere occurrence of the words\nrequires no supernormal explanation, and Mr. Balfour\nsaid so ; but if it is clear that the automatist (whether\n'\ninspired ' or not) had Dr. Verrall in her mind through-\nout, and if the words are remarkably significant in con-\nnexion with him (a fact in no way indicated in the scripts\nwhich she had seen), then some further explanation of\nthen insertion in then context is obviously required.\nIt is strange that anyone who adventures on the field\nof *\nscientific '\ncriticism should fail to grasp an issue so\nsimple.\nAs to \" Hair in a Temple,\" Dr. Tuckett regards it\nas \" almost scientifically illegitimate \" for Mr. Balfour to\nuse the words \"as a matter of fact\" in his statement\nthat Berenice \"is connected by very definite links with\nDr. Verrall's essays on Dante and Statius \". . . Now,\neither these \" very definite \" links exist or they do not.\nIf they do\u2014and most people will readily take Mr. Balfour's\nword on the matter\u2014the connexion in question is removed\nfrom the region of opinion and becomes a matter of fact ;\nand it is difficult to see why it was \" illegitimate \" for him\nto say so. It would indeed have been illegitimate to\nfoist in the statement as any part of the evidence for the\ncontention that Dr. Verrall was concerned in the author-\nship of the scripts, but this Mr. Balfour did not do ;\non the contrary, he states that his inability to give the\nfacts \" diminishes [the] evidential utility \" of the scripts.\nWhy the aUeged illegitimacy is described as almost scien-\ntific (\" almost scientifically illegitimate \") we shall probably\nnever know. Or is \" scientifically almost illegitimate \" what\nis meant ?\nDr. Tuckett's paper concludes with some general\nremarks, which are distributed under six heads. On the\nwhole they are not very helpful. I adopt the numbering\nof his paragraphs.\n(I.) With a rashness not entirely new to us in the writings\n\f488 Rev. M. A. Bayfield.

And what would be the profit of discussing\nin a paper (if that is what is meant) passages which\nappeared not to fit the case ? Was every river that anyone\never crossed to be passed in review ? Would he have the\nabsurd unsuitability of the Styx and Rubicon solemnly\ndemonstrated ? Was even the inappropriateness of Bunyans\nriver to be made clear until someone should have main-\ntained the contrary ? Surely it is for the critic himself\nto find the River which will offer a more plausible\nsolution of the problem than the one with which he\nquarrels.\nWhile on this topic Dr. Tuckett takes occasion to\nobserve :\n\u2014\" It is amusing to note how seriously the\nRev. M. A. Bayfield discusses whether Dr. Verrall or\nsome form of telepathy is the more probable explanation\nof the script : and he talks as if he knew a great deal\nabout Telepathy, although\u2014as I continue to maintain\n\u2014Telepathy itself has never yet been scientifically\nestablished.\" 1\nDr. Tuckett, as we have seen, is not\na severely logical thinker, and the implications which\nunderlie this modest sentence may have escaped him.\nWhat he writes seems to come to this :\n\u2014I, Dr. Tuckett,\nam of opinion that Telepathy is a fond thing vainly\nimagined. Some people write as though they knew a\ngood deal about it, but there is nothing known in its\nfavour that is worth knowing. This is indeed only my\nopinion ;\nnevertheless, so long as I, Dr. Tuckett, continue\nto maintain (that is to say, hold or assert) this mere\nopinion, it is ridiculous for any one to write as though\nTelepathy were an established fact.\nI like a modest man, but Dr. Tuckett pleases me too\nmuch.

On p. 236 (Proceed-\nings, Part LXIX.) Mr. Balfour had written :\n\u2014\" The scripts\nwhich we owe to the group of automatists of whom Mrs.\nVerrall, Miss Verrall, and Mrs. Willett are the chief, go\nback for many years now, and require to be considered\ntogether and as a whole.

Schiller, D.Sc. [part\nREVIEW.\nThe Unconscious, The Fundamentals of Human Personality, Nor-\nmal and Abnormal. By Morton Prince, M.D., LL.D.,\nEmeritus Professor of Diseases of the Nervous System, Tufts\nCollege Medical School ; Consisting Physician to the Boston\nCity Hospital. (New York : The Macmillan Co., 1914.\nPp. xiii, 549.)\nA new book by Dr. Morton Prince is something of an event for\nthe many readers of his fascinating Dissociation of a Personality,\nand for all who are interested in the problem of human person-\nality in a practical way. For he is a leader among the all too\nscanty band of those who have gone out into the untamed jungle\nof concrete facts, and tested their psychological theories by their\nworking, i.e. by the therapeutic success of their applications, and\nthis puts his theorizing, like that of Freud (with whom he is in\npartial agreement), into a different category from that of merely\nacademic psychologists. Moreover, the discoveries he has to\nreport, though they seem at first sight as complicated as they\nare strange, and fit ill into the accepted framework of traditional\nideas, constrain one to feel that it is not armchair introspec-\ntion by professional psychologists of the normal mind (which\nthey always identify with their own), nor even laboratory experi-\nments (usually conducted under conditions too artificial to dis-\nplay the mind's normal working), and least of all philosophic re-\nflection on the metaphysical implications of the notions of '\nmind.'\n'\nself,' '\nsoul,' etc., but only the successful handling of patients\nwho are abnormal only in exaggerating universal tendencies,\nthat can make any real advance towards a scientific solution of\nthe riddle of human personality.\n\fLXX.] Review. 493\nThe claim which Dr. Prince has upon the attention of those\ninterested in this problem rests essentially on his method : for\nthis involves the principle that our preconceptions are to be con-\ntrolled by the facts which observation and experiment reveal,\nand to be tested by their success in handling them. This also\nmeans that the notions we employ to interpret the facts must\nbe conceived as plastic, and modified whenever the facts demand\nit. As Dr. Prince well says (p. 422), \" until we have wider and\nmore exact knowledge, it is well not to theorize, and still more\nnot to dogmatize,\" and all the terms employed must be treated\nas provisional and open to correction. For Avhile some existing\nterms must be used to describe the observed facts, their\ntraditional meaning has no authority as against facts and\nexperiments.\nDr. Prince's present volume is the first instalment of a\ntheoretic discussion of the stores of evidence he has collected,\nwhich he promised in the preface of his Dissociation of a\nPersonality. Actually it is part of his lecture courses on abnormal\npsychology in the Tufts Medical School, and bears traces of\nits origin in a certain diffuseness, lack of arrangement and\nrepetitions. It is also more technical than the Dissociation,\nand though Dr. Prince often draws apt illustrations from the\nwealth of his clinical experience, these references are usually\nof a tantalizing briefness. But, as a whole, the book is very\nstimulating.\nCritical comment should first be directed upon the tools\nwith which Dr. Prince operates, viz. the extant notions relative\nto psychological phenomena. For such comment may be\nhelpful by stimulating him to remodel the extant terminology\nin the light of his unrivalled experience. I will attempt,\ntherefore, to express my sense of the grievous inadequacy\nof our old notions, in the hope that he may be enabled to\nimprove on them, and without fear of giving offence to one\nwho has, I am sure, only used them faute de mieux.\nWe may begin our critical reflections with the notion of\nthe '\nunconscious,' which, after being rendered fashionable by\nE. von Hartmann's metaphysical Philosophy of the Unconscious,\nhas since been used by psychology in a great variety of senses.\nVon Hartmann himself had late in life to recognize no less than\nnineteen distinct senses of '\nunconscious,' though he continued\n\f494 F. C. 8. Schiller, D.Sc. [part\nto maintain that these ambiguities had not vitiated his original\ndoctrine. Dr. Morton Prince is concerned with several of these.\nThe term '\nunconscious '\nappears to denote (1) a \" storehouse\nof neurographic dispositions,\" inferred from the phenomena of\nmemory (p. 229), (2) whatever is devoid of the attributes of con-\nsciousness (p. 249), (3) co-conscious or sub-conscious ideas (ibid.),\nand (4), most strictly and properly, a kind of the subconscious,\nopposed to the co-conscious, and occurring in the two forms of\nneural dispositions and of neural processes (p. 253). So under-\nstood, it \" rather than the conscious is the important factor in\npersonality and intelligence \"\n(p. 262).\nThe subconscious, therefore, in Dr. Prince's most formal ter-\nminology (though not in bis title), becomes the generic notion\ncontrasted with consciousness. The '\nsub- '\nin it is taken to mean\n'\nbeneath,' and it is not, therefore, to be applied to '\ndimly conscious\n'\nor '\nmarginal '\nprocesses in the '\nfringe '\nof consciousness, but\nonly to the '\nultra-marginal '\n(pp. 343-52). That subconscious\nprocesses go on is attested (inter alia) by their subsequent re-\ncovery in memory under hypnosis or in dreams. Their existence\nleads, however, to such verbally contradictory statements as that\n\" the whole content or field of consciousness at any given moment\nincludes not only considerably more than that which is within the\nfield of attention but more than is within the field of awareness \" 1\n(?= consciousness), viz. \"conscious states of which the personal\nconsciousness is not even dimly aware \"\n(p. 351). These, how-\never, are more properly '\nco-conscious '\nprocesses. Further, it is\nadmitted that \" there is a constant shifting or interchange of\nelements going on between the field of attention and the marginal\nand the ultra-marginal zone \"\n(p. 344), and that \" the distinction\nbetween the conscious and the subconscious \" is not always \" sharp\nand precise \" (p. 420, cf. pp. 243, 347).\nIn view of the modification of subsequent action by unconscious\nand subconscious processes, and the proofs of their registration,\nconservation and possible reproduction, Dr. Prince feels entitled\nto regard \" conscious memory as only one type of memory\n\"\n(p. 3). It follows that \" the inability to recall an experience\nis no evidence whatever that it is not conserved,\" even when\nour actual methods fail to recover it, though it would be\n1\nThe author's italics.\n\fLXX.] Review. 495\nexaggeration to say, on the present evidence, that everything\nis conserved (p. 84).\nIt follows, however, that \" ideas which have passed out of mind\nmust be conserved through some sort of residuum \"\n(p. 109), which\nthe author prefers to conceive as neurograms or '\ntraces '\nleft in\nthe brain forming a \" functioning system corresponding to the\nsystem of ideas of the original mental process and capable of re-\nproducing it \"\n(p. 121). This is necessary because \" there is no\nevidence that co-conscious ideas have a continuous existence,\"\nand they are, therefore, \" inadequate to account for the whole\nof the conservation of life's experiences \" (p. 112). Frederic\nMyers's theory of a subliminal mind is rejected as an unnecessary\n\" metaphysical hypothesis,\" and the theory that the seat of the\n'\nconservation '\nis psychical is rejected as \" transcending experi-\nence \"\n(pp. 114-7). Dr. Prince, however, candidly admits that\nhis materialistic \" neurograms are pure theoretical conceptions\nand have never been demonstrated by objective methods of\nphysical research \"\n(p. 132).\nBy '\nco-conscious ideas '\nDr. Prince means \" a coexisting dis-\nsociated consciousness of which the personal consciousness is not\naware \"\n(p. 249). He seems to have fully established its exist-\nence by an abundance of ingenious experiments and observations\nwhich he relates. He denies, however, that normally these co-\nconscious processes form a self (pp. 256-7, 348, cf .\np. 169). Largely,\nit would seem, on the authority of the hypnotic self of \" Miss B.,\"\nwho denied that the pronoun I could be applied to the co-\nconscious processes accompanying her ordinary life, and declared\nthat they were better described as unconnected, discrete sensa-\ntions, impressions and emotions, not synthesized into a personality,\nthough the hypnotic I could subsequently acquire and remember\nthem (p. 348).\nIt will have been noted that Dr. Prince makes much use of the\nterm '\nidea '\nin his psychological descriptions, but, I cannot help\nthinking, without due appreciation of its essential trickiness, and\nwithout explaining its relation to '\nprocess.' Thus (p. 312) a\n'\nperception '\nand an '\nidea '\nof an object are equated, and said\nto be usually complex (cf. p. 315). '\nPerceptions '\nare memory\nimages synthesized with sensations (p. 316). But when percep-\ntion is regarded as a process (p. 321), associations with previous\nexperiences \" give the ideas meaning.\" This '\ncontext ' is itself\n\f496 F. G. 8. Schiller, D.Sc. [part\na process, and may also be regarded as an '\nattitude of mind '\n(p. 321), and is part of the idea's conscious content (p. 323). It\nis (quite truly) pointed out that the psychology of meaning has\nnot been properly worked out, and that to conceive '\nideas '\nas\ncompounded of '\nperception '\nand '\nmeaning '\nis too static, because\nthey shade into one another and should be regarded as one dyna-\nmic process (p. 327). This is profoundly true, but does not suffice\nto eradicate a feeling that Dr. Prince has not adequately brought\nout the vital differences between the psychological and the logical\nsense of '\nidea,' and between the verbal or '\ndictionary '\nmeaning\nof an idea, which is static and supposed to be fixed, but is not\na psychic fact, and the actual or personal meaning, which is a\ndynamic process and a psychic event.1\nBut the gravest objection to the term '\nidea '\nis that it is funda-\nmentally incompatible with the functional or '\nprocess '\nview of\nconsciousness and life, Avhich is what Dr. Prince really believes\nin. It irresistibly suggests that '\nideas '\nare thing-like entities,\nwhich can wander about on their own in a mind of which they\nare not integral parts, and possess a permanent existence and\nidentity, so that they can pass into and out of '\nconsciousness,'\nofficially retaining the title of '\nour thoughts '\neven when we no\nlonger think them or know anything about them (cf. p. Ill),\n'\nassociating '\nthemselves with others, capable of '\nrecall '\n(cf\n.\np. 6), becoming '\ndormant '\nand being '\nstored up '\nin memory,\nlike so many bulbs, or '\nconserved,' like pots of jam. All this\nis the old '\nAssociationist '\nmythology, which has often been re-\npudiated by the more philosophic psychologists, and seems singu-\nlarly unsuited to interpret the complicated facts Dr. Prince has\nobserved. He himself at times recognizes this, as when he argues\nfor the existence of physiological conservation on the ground\nthat the conservation can hardly be psychical (p. 113 f.). More-\nover, the intellectualistic colouring of '\nidea ' renders the term\nvery inappropriate to processes which admittedly are, always\nmore or less, and often intensely, pervaded by emotion. But\nthe climax of awkwardness is reached by this phraseology when\nit is driven to declare that \" neurograms are concepts \" though\nunconscious (p. 148). Surely '\nconcepts '\nmust be psychical, and\nthe confusion of the psychical and the physical could hardly go\nfurther.\n1\nCf. my Formal Logic, Ch. II., \u00a7 3, Ch. VII., \u00a7 9.\n\fLXX.] Review. 497\nIt follows from these objections to the notion of '\nideas '\nthat\nit cannot be lightly conceded that they can form '\ncomplexes,'\nwhich are syntheses of '\nelemental '\nideas (p. 265), even though\nDr. Prince agrees with the Freudians that this notion has great\nclinical value in psychotherapeutics (p. 288). It need not be\ndisputed that patients may often behave as if '\ncomplexes '\nexisted,\nbut the fact that they may be subconscious as well as conscious\nis surely an additional problem, and is not easy to reconcile with\nthe argument that '\nneurograms '\nmust be assumed because there\nis no sufficient evidence that subconscious ideas have a continuous\nexistence (p. 112).\nOn the whole, our terminological survey does not lead to the\nconclusion that Dr. Prince's tools, the notions by which he tries\nto interpret the facts, are particularly well adapted to his pur-\npose. And as he gives such abundant proofs of candour and\nopenmindedness, I am emboldened to make him a present of a\nseries of suggestions of alternative interpretations which might,\nperhaps, do better service.\n(1) In the first place is it not rather hazardous to assume, as\nDr. Prince does at the outset (p. 1), that the conception of\nmechanism must provide an adequate clue to the nature of mind ?\nIf the term is used at all strictly, it seems to leave no room for\nthe specifically biological nature of mental functioning, to which\nall the '\nmechanisms '\nfound in the body must be subordinate.\nFor they must all conduce to the maintenance of life, and be under-\nstood as so conducive. It is a far cry, therefore, from mechanism\nto psychology, and the value of mechanical analogies in psychic\nlife is far from self-evident.\n(2) It may be suggested that seriously misleading implications\nlurk in the notion of '\ndissociation.' The word seems to imply\na mind which is constructed by the '\nassociation '\nof simpler '\nele-\nments,' into which it may again be broken up ; or else, a unitary\nmind, which can somehow fall to pieces. In either case it is in-\nsinuated that the '\nassociation '\nis normal, and the '\ndissociation\n'\nabnormal and morbid.\nBut are not the so-called '\nelements '\nof mind manifest fictions,\nsheer conveniences of description, to which no biological signifi-\ncance can possibly attach ? No mind can possibly maintain its\nexistence on earth unless it contrives effectively to control and\n\f498 F. C. S. Schiller, D.Sc. [part\nguide the behaviour of its body, and the speculations which\ncompound the mind out of '\nelements '\nlike '\ncognition,'\n'\nconation,' and '\nfeeling,' analyse the mind into abstractions\nwhich are incapable of independent existence, and, what is\neven worse, contain no hint of the sort of unity every mental\nprocess must have, viz. relevance to some more or less important\nvital process or purpose. The simplest and most primitive\nmental processes, therefore, must have a functional unity\nwhich is not decomposable into the abstractions of psycho-\nlogical analysis.\nThis need for vital adaptation, however, does not demand or\nguarantee any complete or metaphysical unity of mind, such as\nmany philosophers have postulated. Its requirements would be\nmet by a mental life that consisted of a series of impulses and\nresponses to stimulation each of which acted itself out indepen-\ndently, discontinuously, and separately, and yet so appropriately\nas to conserve the life of the organism. Now, curiously enough,\nsuch is in actual fact the dominant aspect of mental life. Most\nminds live by their instincts and impulses, and not by their reason,\nand in the lower (or immature) minds, whether of adults, chil-\ndren, or animals, there is a strongly marked growth of discon-\ntinuousness and inconsequence the lower we go. And even the\nmost highly systematized human minds are by no means com-\npletely unified ; even the most consistent characters fall far short\nof exhibiting complete mental harmony and congruity in all their\nacts. Consequently the unification of their '\npersonality ' or\n'\nself '\ncannot truly be said to have been achieved.\nIt follows that when they suffer '\ndissociation '\nthey are not\ndoing anything out of the Avay. They are simply reverting to,\nor exhibiting, a lower and more primitive organization of men-\ntality. '\nDissociation '\nin this sense is normal ; it exists every-\nwhere more or less, and is not a morbid disruption of a normal\nunity. We need not, then, be surprised to find vast amounts\nof it in every one. Wherever there are mental processes imper-\nfectly coordinated with others, mental conflicts, incongruities,\nand inconsistencies of any kind, impulses, moods, dreams, etc.,\nthere is '\ndissociation.' The morbid dissociations which Dr.\nPrince has studied so brilliantly are throughout continuous with\ncommon and normal phenomena, and differ from them chiefly\nin intensity. What the psychologist has to explain, therefore,\n\fLXX.] Review. 499\nis not dissociation so much as unification, and the formation\nof a (relatively) stable and well-balanced '\npersonality.'\n(3) It would seem to follow that, strictly, every soul is not one\nbut many, and a battle-ground for hosts of inveterate habits and\nancestral impulses, and that its '\nunity '\nis really an illusion. And\nno doubt the absolute sort of unity which metaphysicians used\nto assume can no longer be regarded as scientifically admissible.\nStill the belief in a unitary soul is not necessarily disposed of.\nIt has, no doubt, to be considerably modified in view of the new\nfacts, and must not be deduced a -priori, but verified empirically ;\nbut I would put it to Dr. Prince that it retains some truth, or,\nat any rate, appreciable utility. In particular, his own facts\ndo not seem to warrant either (a) his acceptance of physiological\npseudo-solutions of psychological problems, or (b) his scorn of\nthe '\nsoul '\nand the '\nsubliminal self.' For whereas the former\ncannot be made to explain ' anything, the latter when properly\nformulated may explain many things which at present puzzle\nhim.\n(a) So long as no satisfactory and really intelligible theory of\nthe relation of body and mind is extant, hypothetical '\nneuro-\ngrams '\nseem quite ineffectual in accounting for the psychological\nfacts of memory.\nFor what after all is a '\nneurogram '\nsupposed to be ? Nothing\nbut a physical alteration in bodily tissue. But how can any such\nalteration in any way help to generate the judgment '\nI remem-\nber experiencing something very like my present perception '\n?\nHave we the least notion of what the '\nI '\nmay be as a '\nnemyo-\ngram '\n? Are we in the least able to trace any specific parallelism\nbetween variations in the flow of blood in the brain and the com-\nings and goings of '\nideas '\nin the mind ? Only negatively. We\ncan after a fashion understand that if the bodily mechanisms\nare instruments for the expression of 'psychical energies normally\ntransmitted through them, any damage done to a physical mechan-\nism may, by blocking the physical channels, arrest and shut off\nthe psychical phenomena mediated by it, at all events temporarily\nand until either the mischief is repaired or alternative modes of\nexpression have grown up (how ?) in the form of new mechanisms\nor of old ones put to new uses. This would explain the observed\nfact that psychic functions which are lost in consequence of in-\njuries to the brain reappear if life continues long enough for the\n\f500 F. C. 8. Schiller, D.Sc. [part\ndamage to be repaired. As Dr. Prince himself points out (pp.\n232-3), \" the decerebrate unconscious (?) animal performs about\nall the movements performed by the normal animal. . . . Even\nspontaneity which at one time was supposed to be lost it is now\nagreed returns, if the animal is kept alive long enough.\" These\nfacts seem to render it imperative that the '\ntransmission '\ntheory,\nas James has called it, of the relation of the psychical to the\nphysical should be seriously considered as an alternative to the\nmaterialistic '\nproduction '\ntheory. It has the logical advantages\nof being incapable of refutation by any conceivable physiological\nevidence, of accounting for a number of admitted facts which\ndo not fit at all well into the materialistic scheme, and of leaving\nroom for the evidence of discarnate psychic action which, though\nnot yet admitted by official science, is far from contemptible as\nevidence.\nAt present, however, it is better to rely chiefly on the second\nof these grounds in order to contest the exclusive claims of\nthe '\nneurogram '\ntheory. It fails to account for a large\nnumber of undisputed facts. Taking for example the familiar\nfact of recollection, Dr. Prince is compelled to regard it as\n\" only a more perfect kind of conscious memory \"\n(p. 144).\nIt is difficult to understand this, as recollection appears to\nhave all the defects of memory ; it may be '\ndim '\nas well as\n'\nclear,' and false as well as correct. Moreover '\nrecollection,'\nas defined, does not seem to be the real thing ; Dr. Prince\nmeans by it merely the '\nlocalization '\nor placing of memories\nin space and time. But this entirely omits the active recol-\nlection, the conscious striving to remember. When I say '\nI\ntried to recollect the plot of my dream, but only got dis-\njointed memories,' this is (like the other facts of self-conscious-\nness and the experiences of activity) prima facie evidence of\nthe activity of a '\nself,' which has to be explained, and is\nnot to be interpreted by '\nneurograms.'\nLastly and most fundamentally, it may be contended that\nthe explanation of memories by '\nneurograms '\nis essentially\nillusory, because memory, the very fact to be explained, is\nimplied in the very notion of a neurogram. For what is this\nremarkable capacity of a physical body to retain an impress of\nits past experiences and to have its subsequent behaviour\nmodified thereby, but a close analogue of memory ? We may\n\fLXX.] Review. 501\nassume that it differs from what is ordinarily termed memory\nin being unconscious ; but Dr. Prince himself has taught us\nhow risky it is to assume that a process is unconscious merely\nbecause the dominant personality does not now remember it,\nand we should remember that it may only seem unconscious\nto us because we are unable (as yet) to get at it from the\ninside, and to get at the mind behind the physical changes,\nas we get at the minds behind the actions of our fellow men.\nThe essential mystery of memory is that the past should\nnot be dead, but should continue to modify present action :\nthat in fact it does this is familiar to us from our personal\nexperience, though we do not yet understand how it is done.\nIt is '\nmemory '\ntherefore which gives a clue to the registration\nof '\nneurograms,' and not vice versa.\n(b) I now feel in a position to break a lance on behalf\nof the theories about human personality which we owe to the\ngenius of Frederic Myers. And to begin with I would enter a\nprotest against dismissing his subliminal self as an unnecessary\nmetaphysical hypothesis. If ever a psychologist formed his\nideas empirically and in close contact with the facts accessible,\nit was Myers, and his ideas seem to me to be thoroughly\nlegitimate and susceptible of empirical verification. Similarly\nI am unable to understand why Dr. Prince should regard the\nnotion of a '\nsoul '\nas involving any '\ntranscendence of experi-\nence.' Metaphysicians no doubt used to conceive the soul as\nsomething beyond its activities, and as somehow '\nunderlying\n'\nand '\nhaving '\nthem, and inaccessible to empirical observation.\nBut that was only because their metaphysics were bad, and\neverywhere assumed a relation of '\nsubstances '\nto '\nattributes\n'\nwhich was essentially unverifiable, and rendered all '\nsubstances\n'\nunknowable as such. Apart from this mistake there is, as\nMr. M'Dougall has so strongly urged, no intrinsic reason why\nthe '\nsoul ' should not be conceived as a principle of scientific\ninvestigation and be used to interpret empirical facts. Only\nof course, before we do so, we must radically disabuse our\nminds of any belief that we can know a priori all about the\nconstitution of a soul and the limits of its powers. We must\nsay rather that a soul '\nis '\nwhat it does, and that what it\ndoes has to be learnt from experience.\nIt must not therefore be assumed (as the metaphysicians\n\f502 F. C. S. Schiller, D.Sc. [part\nwere led to do by very superficial evidence) that the soul is\nnecessarily coextensive with the passing consciousness of the\nmoment, or one, or immutable, or even personal, or again\nthat the traditional distinctions recognized in it adequately\nrepresent the real facts. On the contrary its organization and\nbehaviour have to be studied empirically with conceptions\nwhich are modified and grow as knowledge accrues.\nNow there is in the facts which Dr. Prince and his col-\nlaborators have adduced much that conducts straight to the\nnotion of a soul organized as Myers suggested. Myers tried\nto conceive the manifest and supraliminal psychic processes as\nselections from a larger totality. He gave a reason also for\nthinking that such selection was needed. The functions of\nthe soul might not all be required for the purposes of terres-\ntrial existence, and therefore might be economically cut down\nto those that had survival-value, so that normally these alone\nwould be operative. This is a good biological argument, and\nthere is nothing metaphysical or transcendent about it. He\nalso pointed out that whereas in face of the facts of multiple\npersonality, etc., any absolute unity of consciousness had\nbecome untenable, it need only be inferred that the unity\nmust be subliminal. Hence there may yet be a real soul for\nscience to discover ;\nnay, it may be a bigger thing than the\nuseless creature of metaphysics we have had to abandon.\nOnly it is probably far more complicated than the surface\nindications showed.\nNow has Dr. Prince advanced any evidence to discredit\nthis hypothesis ? On the contrary, he has adduced much that\nfavours it. For example, what about his signal successes in\nre-constituting '\ndissociated '\npersonalities ? Can they mean\nthat he created a unity that never existed before out of a\ndiscordant chaos of soul-dust ? Are not these dissociated\nprocesses best conceived as capable of fusing because they were\nalready connected in a larger whole ? Now this whole cannot\nhave been the body, of which the disorders are apparently\nthe physical stimuli to the dissociations. Besides, it contains\nno reason even for the imperfect psychic unity we find. For\nif the body is a self-regulating system of mechanisms, why\nshould the bodily functions ever have become psychical at all ?\nIf, on the other hand, '\nsoul '\nis the name for what regulates\n\fLXX.] Review. 503\nthe mechanism and is partially revealed in our conscious\nexperiences, both the dissociations and the syntheses of '\nperson-\nality '\nseem to become more intelligible.\nAgain, how interpret the fluidity of the whole psychic material,\nthe continual interchanges between conscious and subconscious,\ncentral and marginal, processes ? Do they not incite us to\nregard the real soul as embracing them all and our distinctions\nas artifices ?\nEven the extraordinary phenomena to which Dr. Prince refers\nas disproving the view that the secondary consciousness is a\npersonality (pp. 348, 169) really tell against his inference.\nGranting that \" there is, normally, no distinct subconscious\nself, or subliminal self, or secondary self, or hidden self\n\"\n(p. 256), but rather a flux of '\nunowned '\nuncontrolled\n'\nthoughts '\nand impulses, figures that come into the subject's\nmind out of the unknown and proceed to add themselves in\norder to comply with a posthypnotic suggestion, and obsessions\nthat the dominant personality is unable either to expel or to\nassimilate, it by no means follows that all this '\nmind-stuff\n'\nis as autonomous and impersonal as it seems. Even our\nnormal thoughts have a good deal of apparent autonomy, and\nonly gradually and imperfectly yield to the behests of the\npersonality. But what is still more to the point, does not the\nvery fact that these impersonal processes could subsequently\nbe taken up into the self,1\nand remembered as having occurred,\nconclusively show that in a way they belonged to it also\nbefore ? The '\nquasi-pathological '\nstate Dr. Prince calls\n'\ndepersonalization '\n(p. 459), in which \" the '\nconscious intelli-\ngence '\npresent is able to think and reason logically and sanely,\nis capable of good judgments, and has an unusually large field\nof memory, and is in short a very intelligent consciousness,\"\nbut nevertheless \" has lost all consciousness of self, and has\nno sense of personality, of anything to which the term '\nI\n'\ncan be ajDplied,\" because \" this sentiment seems to be abso-\nlutely dissociated in this state,\" points to the same conclusion.\nFor surely, as Lotze long ago explained, to be a '\nself '\nit\nis not necessary to feel self-conscious ; it is enough that such\nstates should be continuous with the whole personality and\nbe subsequently claimed. Otherwise it would have to be held\n1\nIn this case a 1\nhypnotic '\nself.\n\f504 F. C. S. Schiller, D.Sc. [part\nthat many of our highest and most characteristic activities,\ne.g. absorbed attention in a scientific research, were '\ndis-\nsociated '\nfrom our personality. Of course, Dr. Prince's evi-\ndence shows that in cases where the '\nmind-stuff ' was sub-\nconscious, the '\nself,' which included the mind-stuff, could not\nhave been the normal waking self, nor even the '\nsecondary\n'\nconsciousness (p. 170) ; but is there anything to prevent\nour supposing that the '\npersonality '\nwhich includes everything\npsychic that occurs in what we call '\nour ' experience may\nhabitually reside at still greater depths % Myers's terminology\nseems to fit such facts most aptly.\nIt can hardly be too strongly emphasized that these pheno-\nmena are in important senses normal. They happen to us all\nmore or less, and even the psychic processes '\nabnormally\n'\nrevealed are akin to and continuous with those we call\n1\nnormal.' Dr. Prince has to confess as much himself. E.g.\nafter interpreting the descriptions of one of his subjects as\nmeaning that \" the thoughts of the secondary consciousness\ndo not form a logical chain. They do not have volition\n\"\n(p. 348), he proceeds on p. 349 to remark that \" the subcon-\nscious thoughts may involve a certain amount of volition and\njudgment.\" Clearly no definite line between the normal and\nthe subnormal can be drawn.\nThe same point may be illustrated from so familiar an experi-\nence as dreaming, which may be shown to involve at least\nthree strata of '\npersonality.' In the first place, to be aware\nof the '\ndream '\nand its unreality there must be a standpoint\nof waking life more or less disconnected from the '\ndream,'\nand able to condemn it. Secondly there is the dreamer, who\nis not identifiable with the normal ivaking self. For not only\ndo his thoughts, feelings and acts often markedly differ from\nthe latter's, but the dissociation between the two is attested\nby the extensive amnesia which the waking has for the dream\nlife. Dreams are usually forgotten with an uncanny and\nabnormal rapidity.\nNor is this all. The dreamer is not himself the maker\nof the dream. He is more commonly its victim, always hallu-\ncinated, and sometimes (as in a nightmare) most unpleasantly\nso. Who or what then is this hidden third party, the maker\nof the dream ? The times are past when it seemed enough\n\fLXX.] Review. 505\nto ascribe dreams to such agencies as unconscious cerebration,\nautomatic recrudescence of impressions, or indigestion. Practical\npsychologists like Dr. Prince and Prof. Freud are by no\nmeans disposed to underrate the constructive ability which\ngoes to the making of dreams, and the value of the clues\nthey give to the dreamer's character and history. If any-\nthing, they seem to common-sense rather to overrate the\nsignificance of dreams. But there can be no doubt that\nthe making of dreams is often a highly intelligent and\nartistic process. Dr. Prince fully endorses the Freudian\ndoctrine that \" underlying a dream is a subconscious process\nwhich fabricates the conscious dream \" (p. 196), though he does\nnot think its meaning is always sexual nor restrict its aim\nto the fulfilment of wishes, but thinks it may express also\nantecedent doubts, scruples and anxieties. He relates an\nelaborate symbolic dream constructed by one of his patients\nout of a hint given her in hypnosis, and remarks that \" it\nis difficult to conceive of a dream allegory being constructed\nby the dream consciousness (i.e. dreamer) itself,\" because\n\" the imagery develops as if done by something else \"\n(pp.\n202-3), and infers that \" a subconscious intelligence \" is required\n(p. 203). If then \" the subconscious process which determines\nthe dream may be what is actually an intelligence,\" and its\n\" fabrication has all the earmarks of purpose, forethought and\nconstructive imagination \"\n(p. 211), it may reasonably be\nidentified with the intelligence that animates automatic writing,\nin which also \" all happened as if there was a deeper under-\nlying process which did the composing \"\n(p. 208). I cordially\nagree, and would only add that if ordinary dreaming implies\nsuch complexity in the personality, we may well expect such\nfurther complications in abnormal cases as are attested in the\nfamous '\nBeauchamp '\ncase. Here '\nSally,' who claimed that\nshe never slept, was aware of what 'Miss B.' dreamt, and\nwas able to describe her dreams as the experience of another\nand yet also from within, while conversely Miss B. sometimes\ndreamt about what '\nSally '\nwas thinking (p. 212).\nIt does not appear, however, that Dr. Prince's attention was\never drawn to a possibility which has long seemed to me the\nmost plausible explanation of the '\nBeauchamp '\ncase, viz. that\n'\nSally '\nwas precisely the '\nmaker of dreams,' enabled by the\n\f506 F. G. S. Schiller, D.Sc. [part lxx.\nabnormal conditions to manifest herself and to control the body,\nbut supjDressed again whenever normal conditions were restored.\nThe Dissociation of a Personality does not contain any decisive\nevidence for or against this theory, perhaps only because\nthe crucial experiments were not made. If, however, '\nSally\n'\nwas not the '\nmaker of dreams,' it simply follows that this\npersonage must be located deeper down still. In any case it\nremains a constituent of our total personality, which it should\n'\ntheoretically '\nbe possible to elicit by experiment.\nIn short, what is called abnormal psychology, but is simply\nthe method of clinical experiment in psychology, seems to\nopen endless vistas of exploration into the abysses of our\n'\npersonality.' For the first time in history there is before\nus a definite prospect of learning what is the real scientific\nmeaning of terms like '\nself,' '\nsoul '\nand '\npersonality,' which\nwe have long been accustomed to use so vaguely and blindly.\nAll, therefore, who are anxious to learn cannot do better\nthan wish Dr. Prince more power to his elbow, and will look\nforward to his next book.\nF.
