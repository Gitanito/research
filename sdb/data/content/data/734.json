Editor: William Thomas Stead.\n\n 1\/1, July 1893-4\/4, October 1897.  Stead  (1849-1912), founded and edited The Review of  Reviews and other journals which devoted  considerable space to spiritualism and psychic  matters, and then started Borderland for more  extensive elaboration of those subjects.  The  journal included, notably, articles by George  Wyld, John Yarker (on \"The Occult Side of  Freemasonry\"), Franz Hartmann (on \"Demon  Lovers\"), Col. H.S. Olcott (on \"Theosophy\"),  pieces on magic mirrors, portraits of  \"Borderlanders\" (Annie Besant, H.P. Blavatsky,  R.L. Stevenson, Mollie Fancher), accounts of the  travails of the Theosophical Society, etc.  It  also first published \"Letters from Julia,\"  Stead's own experiences with the spirit of Julia  Ames and with automatic writing.  Undeterred by  his death on the Titanic, Stead continued to  appear at seances after his death.
