Upon one\nother interest I have not yet touched\u2014to me the weightiest and the\nfarthest reaching of all.\nNo incident in my scientific career is more widely known than the\npart I took many years ago in certain psychic researches. Thirty\nyears have passed since I published an account of experiments tending\nto show that outside our scientific knowledge there exists a Force\nexercised by intelligence differing from the ordinary intelligence\ncommon to mortals. This fact in my life is, of course, well understood\nby those who honoured me with the invitation to become your\nPresident. Perhaps among my audience some may feel curious as to\nwhether I shall speak out or be silent. I elect to speak, although\nbriefly. To enter at length on a still debatable subject would be\nunduly to insist on a topic which\u2014 as Wallace, Lodge, and Barrett\nhave already shown\u2014though not unfitted for discussion at these\nmeetings, does not yet enlist the interest of the majority of my\nscientific brethren. To ignore the subject would be an act of cowardice\n\u2014an act of cowardice I feel no temptation to commit.\nTo stop short in any research that bids fair to widen the gates of\nknowledge, to recoil from fear of difficulty or adverse criticism, is to\nbring reproach on science. There is nothing for the investigator to do\nbut to go straight on, \" to explore up and down, inch by inch, with the\ntaper his reason \" ; to follow the light wherever it may lead, even\nshould it at times resemble a will-o'-the wisp. I have nothing to\nretract. I adhere to my already published statements. Indeed, I\nmight add much thereto. I regret only a certain crudity in those\nearly expositions which, no doubt justly, militated against their\nacceptance by the scientific world. My own knowledge at that time\nscarcely extended beyond the fact that certain phenomena new to\nscience had assuredly occurred, and were attested by my own sober\nsenses, and, better still, by automatic record. I was like some\ntwo-dimensional being who might stand at the singular point of\na Riemann's surface, and thus find himself in infinitesimal and in\nexplicable contact with a plane of existence not his own.\n\fxxxiv.] Part of Presidential Address to British Association. 3\nI think I see a little farther now. I have glimpses of something\nlike coherence among the strange elusive phenomena ; of something\nlike continuity between those unexplained forces and laws already\nknown. This advance is largely due to the labours of another\nAssociation of which I have also this year the honour to be President\n\u2014the Society for Psychical Research. And were I now introducing\nfor the first time these inquiries to the world of science I should choose\na starting-point different from that of old. It would be well to begin\nwith telepathy ; with the fundamental law, as I believe it to be, that\nthoughts and images may be transferred from one mind to another\nwithout the agency of the recognised organs of sense\u2014that knowledge\nmay enter the human mind without being communicated in any\nhitherto known or recognised ways.\nAlthough the inquiry has elicited important facts with reference to\nthe Mind, it has not yet reached the scientific stage of certainty which\nwould entitle it to be usefully brought before one of our Sections. I\nwill therefore confine myself to pointing out the direction in which\nscientific investigation can legitimately advance. If telepathy take\nplace we have two physical facts\u2014the physical change in the brain of\nA, the suggester, and the analogous physical change in the brain of B,\nthe recipient of the suggestion. Between these two physical events\nthere must exist a train of physical causes. Whenever the connecting\nsequence of intermediate causes begins to be revealed the inquiry will\nthen come within the range of one of the Sections of the British\nAssociation. Such a sequence can only occur through an intervening\nmedium. All the phenomena of the universe are presumably in some\nway continuous, and it is unscientific to call in the aid of mysterious\nagencies when with every fresh advance in knowledge it is shown that\nether vibrations have powers and attributes abundantly equal to any\ndemand\u2014even to the transmission of thought. It is supposed by some\nphysiologists that the essential cells of nerves do not actually touch,\nbut are separated by a narrow gap which widens in sleep while it\nnarrows almost to extinction during mental activity. This condition\nis so singularly like that of a Branly or Lodge coherer as to suggest a\nfurther analogy. The structure of brain and nerve being similar, it is\nconceivable there may be present masses of such nerve coherers in the\nbrain whose special function it may be to receive impulses brought from\nwithout through the connecting sequence of ether waves of appro\npriate order of magntiude. Rontgen has familiarised us with an order\nof vibrations of extreme minuteness compared with the smallest waves\nwith which we have hitherto been acquainted, and of dimensions com\nparable with the distances between the centres of the atoms of which\nthe material universe is built up ; and there is no reason to suppose\nthat we have here reached the limit of frequency. It is known that\nb -2\n\f4 [PART\nSir William Crookes, F.RS.\nthe action of thought is accompanied by certain molecular movements\nin the brain, and here we have physical vibrations capable from their\nextreme minuteness of acting direct on individual molecules, while\ntheir rapidity approaches that of the internal and external movements\nof the atoms themselves.\nConfirmation of telepathic phenomena is afforded by many con\nverging experiments, and by many spontaneous occurrences only thus\nintelligible. The most varied proof perhaps, is drawn from analysis of\nthe subconscious workings of the mind, when these, whether by\naccident or design, are brought into conscious survey. Evidence of a\nregion below the threshold of consciousness has been presented, since\nits first inception, in the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical\nResearch ; and its various aspects are being interpreted and welded\ninto a comprehensive whole by the pertinacious genius of F. W. H.\nMyers. Concurrently, our knowledge of the facts in this obscure\nregion has received valuable additions at the hands of labourers in\nother countries. To mention a few names out of many, the observations\nof Richet, Pierre Janet, and Binet (in France), of Breuer and Freud\n(in Austria), of William James (in America), have strikingly illustrated\nthe extent to which patient experimentation can probe subliminal\nprocesses, and can thus learn the lessons of alternating personalities,\nand abnormal states. Whilst it is clear that our knowledge of sub\nconscious mentation is still to be developed, we must beware of rashly\nassuming that all variations from the normal waking condition are\nnecessarily morbid. The human race has reached no fixed or change\nless ideal ; in every direction there is evolution as well as disintegration.\nIt would be hard to find instances of more rapid progress, moral\nand physical, than in certain important cases of cure by suggestion\u2014\nagain to cite a few names out of many\u2014by Li\u00e9beault, Bernheim, the\nlate Auguste Voisin, Berillon (in France), Schrenck-Notzing (in Ger\nmany), Forel (in Switzerland), van Eeden (in Holland), Wetterstrand\n(in Sweden), Milne Bramwell and Lloyd Tuckey (in England). This\nis not the place for details, but the vis medicatrix thus evoked, as it\nwere, from the depths of the organism, is of good omen for the upward\nevolution of mankind.\nA formidable range of phenomena must be scientifically sifted\nbefore we effectually grasp a faculty so strange, so bewildering, and for\nages so inscrutable, as the direct action of mind on mind. This delicate\ntask needs a rigorous employment of the method of exclusion\u2014a\nconstant setting aside of irrelevant phenomena that could be explained\nby known causes, including those far too familiar causes, conscious and\nunconscious fraud. The inquiry unites the difficulties inherent in all\nexperimentation connected with mind, with tangled human tempera\nments and with observations dependent less on automatic record than\n\fxxxiv.] Part of Presidential Address to British Association. 5\non personal testimony. But difficulties are things to be overcome\neven in the elusory branch of research known as Experimental\nPsychology. It has been characteristic of the leaders among the group\nof inquirers constituting the Society for Psychical Research to combine\ncritical and negative work with work leading to positive discovery. To\nthe penetration and scrupulous fair-mindedness of Professor Henry\nSidgwick and of the late Edmund Gurney is largely due the establish\nment of canons of evidence in psychical research, which strengthen\nwhile they narrow the path of subsequent explorers. To the detective\ngenius of Dr. Richard Hodgson we owe a convincing demonstration\nof the narrow limits of human continuous observation.\nIt has been said that \" Nothing worth the proving can be proved,\nnor yet disproved.\" True though this may have been in the past, it\nis true no longer. The science of our century has forged weapons of\nobservation and analysis by which the veriest tyro may profit. Science\nhas trained and fashioned the average mind into habits of exactitude\nand disciplined perception, and in so doing has fortified itself for tasks\nhigher, wider, and incomparably more wonderful than even the wisest\namong our ancestors imagined. Like the souls in Plato's myth that\nfollow the chariot of Zeus, it has ascended to a point of vision far\nabove the earth. It is henceforth open to science to transcend all we\nnow think we know of matter, and to gain new glimpses of a\nprofounder scheme of Cosmic Law.\nAn eminent predecessor in this chair declared that \"by an in\ntellectual necessity he crossed the boundary of experimental evidence,\nand discerned in that matter, which we in our ignorance of its latent\npowers and notwithstanding our professed reverence for its Creator,\nhave hitherto covered with opprobrium, the potency and promise of all\nterrestrial life.\" I should prefer to reverse the apophthegm, and to say\nthat in life I see the promise and potency of all forms of matter.\nIn old Egyptian days a well known inscription was carved over the\nportal of the temple of Isis : \" I am whatever hath been, is, or ever\nwill be ; and my veil no man hath yet lifted.\" Not thus do modern\nseekers after truth confront Nature\u2014the word that stands for the\nbaffling mysteries of the universe. Steadily, unflinchingly, we strive\nto pierce the inmost heart of Nature, from what she is to re-construct\nwhat she has been, and to prophesy what she yet shall be. Veil after\nveil we have lifted, and her face grows more beautiful, august, and\nwonderful, with every barrier that is withdrawn.\n\f6 [part\nWilliam Romaine Neivbold.\nII.\nA FURTHER RECORD OF OBSERVATIONS OF CERTAIN\nPHENOMENA OF TRANCE.\nPART n.\nA.\u2014By Professor \"William Romaine Newbold.\n\u00a7 1. Introductory.\nI have been present at twenty-six sittings with Mrs. Piper, and Dr.\nHodgson kindly supervised seven others at which I was not present,\nalthough the communicators invoked and the topics introduced were\nsuggested by me. Fifteen sittings, including two of those at which I\nwas not present, were devoted for the most part to getting evidence to\nprove the identity of the alleged communicators ; the remainder to\ngetting from them their own theory of the phenomena and their\ndescription of the conditions under which they were working and of\nthe life they live. While it is impossible at present to accept these\nstatements as true, it is of the greatest importance to put them on\nrecord as affording clues for the guidance of experiments with other\nautomatists. The material got from this latter series I shall leave\nentirely to Dr. Hodgson. I am myself concerned with the evidence\nfor identity only.\nOf the general character of that evidence the following pages\nwill give a sufficient account. In making my abstract I have tried to\ninclude the more important passages which are relevant to the question\nof identity. I have been especially careful to bring into prominence\nall distinct failures and any other facts which would tend to detract\nfrom the surprising character of many of the statements made. As a\nrule I have not transcribed verbatim pages of confusion from which no\ncoherent thought can be extracted. But in the cases in which such\nconfusion immediately precedes the appearance of some surprising bit\nof information, it has been in several cases given in full, that the\nreader may form his own opinion of the methods by which such results\nare attained. For examples ef. the giving of the names of Morton,\nMurdoch, and the introduction of Mr. Burton (pp. 15, 27, 32). When\nclearly intelligible passages contained repetitions of the same word due\nto the inability of the sitter to decipher the first attempt, or words and\n\fxxxiv.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 7\nphrases which have nothing to do with the general tenor of the\ncommunication, the extraneous material has frequently been omitted\nwithout indication of the fact.\nNames of persons and of places have been in nearly all cases sup\npressed. In the selection of pseudonyms I have taken great pains to\nrepresent familiar names by names at least as familiar, and unfamiliar\nnames by names as unfamiliar. So also in the transcription of\nphonetic approximations to the real names, I have taken great care to\nmake the representatives letter for letter analogous to their originals.\nA few other changes have been made in order still further to conceal\nidentity, but nothing which could at all affect the value of the evidence.\nWith regard to the origin of the information given, I have no\ntheory to offer. I can frame none to which I cannot myself allege\nunanswerable objections. I am satisfied, however, as is every one\nso far as I know who has studied the case at any length, that it\nwas not consciously got by Mrs. Piper during waking life and then\nfraudulently palmed off on the sitter as supernormal. There is every\nreason for believing that there is no memory bond between Mrs.\nPiper's waking consciousness and that of her trance life.\nA question more difficult to answer is that which inquires into the\namount of information which Mrs. Piper's trance personalities get\nfrom the sitter. Even without resorting to the assumption of a tele\npathic relation between the sitter and the \" medium,\" no one who has\nseen how readily an acute \" medium \" will construct an appropriate\n\" spirit \" message upon the suggestions furnished by a sitter's looks\nand words will be easily convinced by any such record as I here offer.\nThis is a legitimate objection, and to some extent impairs the value\nof the evidence. In dealing with personalities who had had much\nexperience in writing, and occasionally with those who represented\nthemselves as having been long dead, it was usually possible to keep\ncomplete notes of the sitter's questions and answers. The writing was\nrelatively slow, and illegible words were readily rewritten. But the\nalleged spirits of those who had but recently died, or who had died a\nviolent death, or who had been bound to the sitter by strong emotional\nties, nearly always display great excitement and confusion. The time\nand attention of one and even two sitters is fully occupied in con\ntrolling the violent convulsions which seize the writing arm, keeping a\nconstant flow of cheering talk going for the benefit of the communica\ntor, replacing broken pencils and at the same time deciphering the\npages of delirious nonsense which the hand scribbles off as fast as it\ncan tear over the sheets, any misreading of which greatly increases the\nexcitement and confusion.\nUnder such circumstances, our notes necessarily became frag\nmentary, and when the sitting was written up a few hours later, many\n\f8 [pabt\nWilliam Romaine Newbold.\nof our questions and answers had to be supplied from memory. It is\npossible that some suggestions given by sitters have escaped our notice,\nand the evidence is to that extent untrustworthy.\nI am myself satisfied that the percentage of error thus introduced\nis not considerable. Both Dr. Hodgson and I have seen much of pro\nfessional mediums, and are thoroughly familiar with the methods of\n\"fishing\" upon which they generally rely. Hence we always had\nsuch possibilities in mind, and it would have been impossible for any\nlarge amount of detailed information to have been extracted from\nus in this way without our knowledge. Occasionally our vigilance\nrelaxed, and we made careful note of the fact. For examples see the\nquotation \"Fama tempus vivat\" (p. 45), and Mr. Bonney's name\n(p. 43). Probably it occasionally relaxed without our making any\nnote of it, but that could not have happened very often.\nThe reader will observe that \" yes \" and \" no \" are often written\nwhen no questions are recorded. This is due to the fact that, the\nwriting being exceedingly illegible and coming very rapidly, the sitter\nreads aloud with a slight interrogatory inflection at any convenient\nresting point, as at the end of a sheet or at an apparent pause in the\nsense. To this the writer responds with \"yes\" or ' no,\" to show\nwhether he is being correctly understood.\nIf these utterances are, as I believe them to be, entirely dissevered\nfrom the normal consciousness of Mrs. Piper, they as truly reveal to us\na new world of mind as the microscope reveals a new world of matter.\nGeorge Pelham and his companions undoubtedly record for us conscious\nexperiences which are subjectively as real as any that you or I ever\nexperienced. But when we ask to what metaphysical category of Being\nthey are to be assigned, we find no satisfactory answer. Are they\nmerely unusually stable dream states, generated in connection with\nMrs. Piper's brain, interrupted perhaps during her normal life, but\nresuming the thread of their phantasmal existence with the recurrence\nof the convulsions which usher in her trance 1 Or are they what they\nprofess to be, human minds, divested of their mortal bodies, and lead\ning an independent existence in a supersensible world?\u2014a world as real\nas this present world in the only true sense of real, being an inevitable\nportion of the common experience of conscious beings.\nOf the existence of such a world we cannot satisfy ourselves by\nany of our usual tests. We are confined to the evidence for the iden\ntity of the alleged communicators. Of the extent and value of the\nevidence to be got from my series of sittings the reader can himself\njudge. Much of it seems to me strong, and much more I cannot\nreconcile with the theory of identity.\nThe only alternative to the \" spirit \" theory is the theory which\nascribes the phenomena to secondary personalities, derived from the\n\fxXXiv.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 9\nweaving together by Mrs. Piper's nervous mechanism of all the\ncomplex suggestions of the seance room, supplemented by telepathic\nand clairvoyant impressions got in connection with the sitter and with\nthe articles which he brings. For this we can find some analogies on\na smaller scale ; the greater part of my own experiences, if taken\nseverally, seem to me susceptible of such an explanation, and there\nare a few items, such as the Morse incident (p. 24), which almost\nirresistibly suggest it.\nTaken as a whole, however, I do not think that the phenomona\ncan be satisfactorily explained by reference to telepathy or clair\nvoyance. Indeed the phenomena which those words vaguely designate\nare themselves too little known to provide principles for the elucidation\nof the less known, and although, as I have said, individual scraps of\ninformation may be ascribed with some show of plausibility to a\ntelepathic or clairvoyant origin, the arrangement of these scraps into\nmosaics of thought, which, however defaced, still often irresistibly\nsuggest the habits, tastes, and memories of some friend deceased\u2014for\nthis I know of no telepathic or clairvoyant analogy. For example,\nthe demand made by \" aunt Sallie \" that I should identify myself by\nexpounding the significance of \"two marriages in this case, mother and\naunt grandma also,\" admits of no satisfactory telepathic explanation\nThe fact was known to me and might have been got telepathically.\nBut why is the dream personality of the only communicator who died\nin my childhood the only one who seeks to identify me ? Why does\nshe allude in so indirect a fashion to the mode of her death (see p. 34)?\nCertainly no stratum of my personality would have felt hesitation in\nalluding to so commonplace a matter as a laparotomy, or would have\nlacked suitable language in which to express the allusion. Whence\ncame the reference to \" Carson the Dr.,\" a circumstance which I had\ntotally forgotten, if I ever knew it ? And, finally, why was the faded\npersonality of this almost forgotten maiden aunt evoked at all 1 I\nwas not ten years old when she died, and she had been dead twenty\nyears. She was a teacher, lived in Philadelphia, died in a hospital in\nNew York, and was buried near Philadelphia. I do not know the\nexact date of her death or the exact place of her burial. Probably\nfew persons beside her immediate relatives know that such a person\never existed, and even her relatives seldom think of her. Why were\nthese dim memories so clearly reflected, while others, far stronger,\nproduced no effect 1 Why were my memories, in process of reflection,\nso refracted as to come seemingly not from my masculine and adult\npoint of view but from that of a spinster aunt who could not at first\nrecognise me with confidence, and who, taking it for granted that her\nlittle nephew of ten had not been informed as to the precise cause of\nher death, expected him, although grown to man's estate, to convey a\n\f10 [part\nWilliam Romaine Newbold.\nvery obvious allusion to his mother for interpretation without himself\nknowing what it meant 1\nThe telepathic interpretation of my other sittings might be criti\ncised in much the same manner. Evidence of this sort does not\nsuggest telepathy, it suggests the actual presence of the alleged\ncommunicators, and if it stood alone I should have no hesitation in\naccepting that theory.\nUnfortunately it does not stand alone. It is interwoven with\nobscurity, confusion, irrelevancy, and error in a most bewildering\nfashion. I agree with Dr. Hodgson that the description given by the\nwriters themselves of the conditions under which they are labouring\nwould, if accepted, account for a very large part of this matter. But,\neven after the most generous allowance on this score, there remains\nmuch which the writers cannot explain. Easily first comes their\nalmost total inability to observe and report the phenomena of the\nmaterial world, coupled with their reiterated assertions that they can\nand will do so. Second should be put, perhaps, the unaccountable\nignorance which they often betray of matters which upon any theory\nshould have been well known to them. In the third place, the general\nintellectual, as distinguished from the moral and religious, tone of the\nmore recent communications is far lower than we would expect of\nbeings who had long enjoyed exceptional opportunities for the acquisi\ntion of knowledge. Concrete descriptions of the other world can be\nhad indeed ad infinitum, but of organised, systematised, conceptual\nknowledge there is little trace.\nFrom such inconsistent material one can draw no fixed conclusions.\nBut there is one result which I think the investigation into Mrs.\nPiper's and kindred cases should achieve. For any theory some\nintrinsically strong evidence must be adduced, even if there be but\nlittle of it, before the theory can be given any standing in court\nat all. Until within very recent years the scientific world has tacitly\nrejected a large number of important philosophical conceptions on the\nground that there is absolutely no evidence in their favour whatever.\nAmong those popular conceptions are those of the essential independ\nence of the mind and the body, of the existence of a supersensible\nworld, and of the possibility of occasional communication between\nthat world and this. We have here, as it seems to me, evidence that\nis worthy of consideration for all these points. It was well expressed\nby a friend of mine, a scholar who has been known for his uncom\npromising opposition to every form of supernaturalism. He had had\na sitting with Mrs. Piper, at which very remarkable disclosures were\nmade, and shortly afterwards said to me, in effect, \" Scientific men can\nnot say much longer that there is no evidence for a future life. I\nhave said it, but I shall say it no longer ; I know now that there is\n\fxxxiv.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 11\nevidence, for I have seen it. I do not believe in a future life. I\nregard it as one of the most improbable of theories. The evidence is\nscanty and ambiguous and insufficient, but it is evidence and it must\nbe reckoned with.\"\nIf the evidence which the Mrs. Piper case affords proves sufficient\nto draw any considerable body of competent men into these lines of\nresearch, it will have done as much as, and more than, I can venture\nto expect.\n,\nDetailed Cases.\nCase I.\nSubmission to Mrs. Piper ofarticles with which few living persons liad\nany associations and the sitter none at all.\nIn the winter of 1890-1891 my interest in the problems commonly\ntermed psychical was aroused for the first time by reading the report of\nsittings held with Mrs. Piper in England. Soon afterwards, February\n18th, 1891, I wrote to Dr. Hodgson, with whom I had at that time\nno personal acquaintance, saying that I would be glad to arrange\nfor some experiments with Mrs. Piper with a view to discover the\nsource of the information conveyed or suggested by articles. I told\nhim that I had in my possession articles that had belonged to persons\nlong since dead, of whom few living persons know anything. I\nhoped, in the course of my work as an amateur genealogist, to discover\nmore about some of these persons, and might be able to verify state\nments now made by Mrs. Piper, which are absolutely unknown to\nanyone living.\nDr. Hodgson replied accepting my suggestion, but asking me care\nfully to refrain from telling him anything whatever about the articles\nwhich I would send. On the 9th of the following May I received a\nletter from him asking for the articles, and I at once sent them on.\nEach was wrapped in paper, sealed with sealing-wax, and then\nwrapped in rubber cloth.\nDr. Hodgson submitted these articles to Phinuit at sittings held\nMay 15th, 21st, 25th, June 4th, and June 5th, 1891. Phinuit talked\nvolubly about them, but said little that was in the least relevant ; a\nlarge part was distinctly false, and the balance either unverifiable or\nso vaguely stated as to be worthless for evidential purposes.\n[The above series of sittings were those to which I referred, in\nconnection with the articles furnished by Mr. \"V.,\" on p. 132 of my\nprevious Report on Mrs. Piper, Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VIII. It\nappeared that none of these articles fulfilled the condition of having\nbeen much handled or worn exclusively by only one or two persons j\n\f12 William Romaine Newbold. [part\nand these experiments, with others of a like nature, incline me to think\nthat this condition is practically necessary for any success. I shall\nrefer to this question in Part II. of my Report.\u2014R. H.]\nCase II.\nFrederick Alkin Morton.\nIn the spring of 1893 I met a man whom I shall call William\nMorton. He was an intelligent man, by profession a dealer in real\nestate, loans, and mortgages, of limited education and of rather feeble\nhealth. In 1894 I found that his tactile sensibility on one side was\ndefective. He told me that he had for some time heard rapping\nsounds, often saw apparitions, and at any time, by allowing himself to\nfall into an abstracted mood, could hear faint voices whispering to him.\nHe found it very difficult to hear what the voices said. On one\noccasion, during a seance in May of 1892, he had fallen, he told me, into\na trance and believed himself to have passed into another world. He\ndescribed his experiences to me in detail. His hand frequently wrote\nautomatically, and at the inception of the writing the arm was much\nconvulsed, much as in Mrs. Piper's case. The content of the writing\ngave no evidence of supernormal powers, but in the whispered voices\nI detected what seemed to me indubitable evidence of telepathy,\npossibly of clairvoyance.\nOn March 24th, 1894, I happened to meet Mr. Morton unexpect\nedly, and in the course of conversation he told me that he had\npredicted a suicide, which was afterwards verified. I pressed him to\ngive me names and circumstances, but he refused on the ground that\nthe person who had committed suicide had borne the same name that\nhe did. I then said that a friend of mine, Frederick A. Morton, had\ntaken his own life not long before. Mr. Morton replied that that was\nodd, the person of whom he had been speaking was an uncle of his\nown, yet he thought that a person calling himself Fred Morton had\npresented himself to him at a seance some time in the preceding\nDecember, said that he had committed suicide by shooting himself\nthrough the head while standing before a mirror, and wished to\nsend a message to someone whose name W. M. could not remember.\nThe death of Mr. Frederick Atkin Morton took place under the\ncircumstances above described, but as full accounts appeared in the\npapers at the time, and as I had mentioned the name, W. M.'s\nknowledge of it was not surprising. After this I frequently had,\nthrough the automatic writing of W. Morton, what purported to be\nmessages from Frederick A. Morton, but found in them not a sugges\ntion of the alleged writer's presence.\n\fxxxiv.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 13\nOn April 13th, 1894, I had a sitting with Mrs. Piper arranged for\nme by Dr. Hodgson, but she was unable to go into a trance at all.\nW. M. knew on this occasion that I went to New York, but I have\nevery reason for thinking that he did not know my errand. On my\nreturn, I procured from Dixon Morton, a brother of Frederick A.\nMorton's, a tie, a bunch of keys and two small books, which had\nbelonged to F. A. M. I did not tell D.M. what T wished them for.\nOn the evening of April 26th we had a sitting with W. M., at which\nalleged messages came from F. A. M. I asked the writer whether he\nwould appear to me the following day through a medium I expected to\nsee. At first he refused, on the ground that I did not believe in his\nidentity, but after a little persuasion he agreed to do it. I offered to\ntell him the address to which I was going, but this he refused, saying\nthat he knew it already. He gave an .address in New York, at which\nMrs. Piper had never been. Moreover, in the two weeks which had\nelapsed since my first sitting, Mrs. Piper had changed her address. I\nlearned it myself late on the afternoon of April 26th and immediately\ndestroyed the letter. I went to New York early on the morning of\nApril 27th, taking with me the articles. The first sitting was\nextremely confused.\nAt this, as at the former sitting, I passed under the name of\n\" Smith.\" Mrs. Piper went into trance almost immediately. The\narticles were at first grasped by Phinuit and held against the back of\nthe neck. Later, they were attached by a rubber band to the back of\nthe hand. (N.B.\u2014That notes marked D. M. are by Morton's brother,\nwhom I have termed Dixon Morton ; others are by myself.)\n[Phinuit began by making some complimentary remarks about me and\nventured a prophecy that I would soon go abroad.

When the scar was first mentioned I\nhad no recollection of it ; in a moment or two a faint recollection began to\ntake shape in my mind and it has ever since been quite distinct. I think it\nmust be an hallucination of memory, of which I have had several, for I have\nfound only two other persons who had any recollection of it at all ; neither\nis sure of it, and those who knew him best, including all the members of his\nfamily, know nothing of it].

I met him, and on the morning of the 29th we went to\nthe house where Mrs. Piper was staying. He was introduced as Mr.\nJones. The first writing was by George Pelham ; after alluding to some\nother matters concerning some of Dr. Hodgson's earlier experiments,\nhe said, \"There is a young man here who is extremely anxious to speak\nto his brother. I'll help come in here and speak to him.\" While\nG. P. was writing Phinuit was talking to me. Several times he made\nremarks such as, \" Now, don't be in a hurry, you'll have plenty of\ntime to talk soon,\" which I could not understand. I asked him what\nhe meant, saying that I was not in a hurry and never said I was. To\nthis Phinuit replied that he was talking to a young man in the spirit\nwho was in a great hurry to begin communicating.\n[F. A. M. writes]\nOh my dear Dick I am so glad to see you here my deareat brother for I\nlove you [D.

I am happy now.\n[In response to leading questions from D. M., the writer claims that he\nhad been in a confused condition a few days only, that his mind was affected,\nthat he suffered little, knew that he was out of his mind and tried to save\nhimself. None of this is verifiable, but is not improbable. When questioned\nabout the alleged attempt to communicate through the medium W. M. he\nsaid that the errors were due] to his mind acting . . . his own mind\nacted in error.\n(Where were you on the Saturday and Sunday ?) Where was I at the\ntime, Dick ? . . . In the room.

M. : Not\nverified but not improbable.] [When asked whom he saw on Saturday,\n\fxxxiv.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 17\nafter considerable confusion he said he saw a person named Parker Howard.\nHe had red or sandy hair; he was in trouble and wished F. A. M. to help\nhim. Said that ho [P. H. ] was a newspaper man ; named the paper upon\nwhich he was employed. For further history of this incident see p. 19.\nAfter much confused and irrelevant material occurs the remark]\nWho is taking my place now ? [Apparently referring to paper edited by\nF. A. M.] (You mean on journal ? ) Yes. (It has been discontinued.) Too\nbad ; I n sorry it is dropped. Could you not keep on with it ? It would\nhelp you Dick, and be a success I am sure. ...

A. Morton's death is correct as far as\ncan be verified. He had been engaged in editing a paper for a few\nweeks only. One Monday morning in the summer of 1893 his body\nwas found lying before his bureau, a bullet through the head and a\nrevolver lying on the floor beside him. No reason could be assigned\nfor the act ; no one could be found who had seen him for some days,\nbut those who had last seen him thought him as cheerful as usual.\nThe autopsy showed that the brain was much inflamed, and the\nphysicians said that he was probably in the first stages of brain fever\nat the time of his death.\nIn the course of the month of May I had some sittings with an\neducated young woman, not a spiritist, who had shown tendencies\nto automatism. Her automatic writing was of the most rudimentary\nkind and never became legible. She told me she had once seen a table\nrise from the floor while no one but herself was touching it to a height\nof a couple of feet or so above its normal position, but I was never\nable to repeat this experiment and never myself saw anything which\nwould lead me to think that she had any supernormal powers. On\nJune 7th, 1894, Dr. Hodgson had a sitting with Mrs. Piper at\nArlington Heights at which Fred Morton presented himself. He\nsaid he had had great difficulty in reaching Billie although he, Billie,\nhad been asking for him, that the light was not sufficient to enable\nhim to give clear and accurate messages. This light was a woman but\nnot so much entranced as Mrs. Piper :\u2014\u2022\" we see this one's spirit as\nwe see our own, but not the other's as clearly, only part of that spirit\nis visible to us sir. \"We communicate through the mind of the half-\nintelligence ... I have seen him in two distinct places, one a\n\fxxxiv.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 19\nlady, the other a gentleman, the last one is a lady and the first a man.\"\nDr. Hodgson saying something which implied that he supposed this\nmedium was impressed by hearing only, the writer interrupted \" Look\nhere sir, I can make her write as well.\"\nAt my request, R. H. had a sitting with W. M., at which nothing\nof interest occurred. Upon his return, R. H. was informed by Phinuit\nand G. P. that W. M. had a little light, but was not altogether honest.\nBeing unable to discover Parker Howard, Dr. H., at my suggestion,\nasked the writer whether he had meant Philip Hoard, whose name had\nbeen mentioned to me by Dr. M. The writer showed excitement and\nclaimed that this was the person whom he had had in mind, reiterated\nthe statement that he had seen him just before his death, and that\nthey had spoken of doing some \" journal work \" together.\nI found that Mr. Philip Hoard was paying teller in a bank ; he\nhad known F. A. M. very slightly and had not seen or communicated\nwith him for three years before his death. Nothing that was said of\nParker Howard is at all applicable to Mr. Hoard save the allusion to\nsandy hair, Mr. Hoard's moustache being reddish brown, while his hair\nis quite dark.

As\nthe \"Club \"had no existence save at the annual dinner and its members\nseldom met during the year, I hardly thought of it as a club at all.]\nThe writer then asked me how things were going \"at the college.\" I\ngave him some items of University news which were appropriately received.\nHe mentioned himself the surname of a University officer ; when I read it\nwith the name of the office attached and asked whether that was what he\nmeant, he replied] yes I do, the old idiot [which was a rather emphatic ex\npression of a sentiment which is quite widespread.

No Philoe oh you know [There\nis a literary society at the University of Pennsylvania,\u2014the Philomathean\nSociety, commonly known to the students as \" Philo,\" and F. A. M. was a\nmember. Here follows a page of confusion, scarcely any of which is in\ntelligible. The writer asked again after his book on philosophy and repeats\nthat he lent it to Sharpless ; the remainder of the sitting is of no evidential\nvalue.]\nThe sitting of June 22nd was devoted to the F. A. M. case, Dr.\nHodgson, Dixon Morton and myself being present. I give here\nmerely the gist of the statements which were unverifiable or untrue,\nand copy in detail those which proved true.\n[F. A. M. stated that his mother was at the time suffering from severe\ndizziness and headache : this cannot be verified. The location of the scar\nwas given as on the left temple. It was] quite conspicuous ; I parted my\nhair to cover it. Ask Mother if she does not remember the fall I had from\nthe steps at Carter,s years ago. She and I were together when I fell I\nknow and remember it very well and if you ask her she will know what 1\nmoan. [Mrs. Morton remembers nothing of the kind. D.

M. was careful to refrain from any sort of suggestion, the Writer\nwrote distinctly] M A M A' [with the accent upon the last syllable. D. M.\nread it so, asking whether that was right, and was told it was. This was\ncorrect. D. M. then asked about a difficulty which his brother had had\nwith a certain man. The writer professed to remember it well, but when\nasked for the name gave it incorrectly as Henry Hollis. D. M. then asked\nabout F. A. M.'s plans for a country house and got a good many confused\nstatements involving this Hollis and a man named Frank Eliot. None of\nthis can be verified and most of it is known to be untrue. No such persons\nas Eliot and Hollis have been found. I asked again about the Frank Bezay\nwhom the writer had mentioned before.] (What is his profession?) medicn\n\fxxxiv.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 21\n[very illegible] Dr. Dr. (What does ho look like?) can't get it on here\nB .

(Where did you have this talk with Bezay of which\nyou spoke ? ) [In this I was wrong for it is not quite clear whether the\nwriter intended to ascribe the talk to Mr. Hoard or Dr. Bezay] at the . . .\nin his office when my head was muddled. (Do you remember where it was ?)\nYes I do. (Could you tell us ? ) Yes, in\u2014Philda. (What street ? ) on Broad.\n[Here R. H. suggests that the first thought occurring to a writer is often\nwritten. ] Yes I remember this street. (Is Bezay's office on Broad street ? )\nI can't recall this B .\n[This Bezay incident is most perplexing. In the winter of 1890-91 I met\nat the house of my brother-in-law a friend of his named Dr. James Bezay. I\nsaw Dr. Bezay perhaps two or three times. In the winter of 1892-93 I saw\nhim once or twice. He sometimes wore a beard of rather light tint but not\nred, as I recollect it, and sometimes a moustache only. At the time of the\nsitting I thought his name was Frank. Upon my return home I endeavoured\nto find Dr. Bezay and at first without success. But I did find that there\nwas another physician named Frank Bezay who had an office on street\njust off Broad and the above description exactly fits him. He is rather tall\nand heavily built and wears a beard and moustache of a dark reddish brown.\nAlthough I had no conscious acquaintance with him it is very probable that\nI had heard his name and had possibly seen him. Dr. Bezay's office is about\nfive squares distant from F. A. M.'s former rooms, but Dr. Bezay tells me\nhe never knew Mr. Morton and can recall no such visit. I afterwards found\nDr. James Bezay and learned that he also did not know F. A. M. The\noccurrence of the name, coupled with so accurate a description, is therefore\nvery puzzling.]\n[We enquired again about Philip Hoard. Were told that Mr. Hoard has\na moustache and wears eyeglasses. The moustache is described as light\nMr. Hoard is tall, slight, has dark hair, dark reddish brown moustache, and\nwears eyeglasses. He was so kind as to read over my accounts of all theso\nsittings, but was entirely at a loss to explain the allusions to him.\nThe writer now spontaneously attracts my attention to what he is about\nto say, and after some difficulty, during which I was very careful to give\nhim no assistance whatever, succeeds in writing the name]\nAndie Le Grand\n[which was the name of a common friend of ours who was much better\nknown to F. A. M. than to me. He lives in New Orleans ; I have not seen\nhiin for more than ten years. The writer proceeded to give us a long\naccount of a prank in connection with a bat and ball, which he says that he,\nA. Le G., and Jack Mackenzie Walker had played. It was impossible to\nverify this incident. Mr. Le Grand and Mr. Walker remember nothing\nabout it.]\nThe chief points given by this communicator which would go to\nshow his identity with the real F. A. M. are :\u2014(1) His use of the word\n\f22 [part\nWilliam Romaine Ncwbold.\nBillie. (2) The giving of his own name in full. (3) The mention of\nJack McKenzie Walker, Andie Le Grand, Sharpless, and the name of\nthe University officer of whom I have spoken. (4) The mention of his\nbrother's name Dick. (5) His evident acquaintance with the manner\nof F. A. M.'s death, especially in the second sitting. (6) The allusion to\nthe Survivors' Club. (7) The spontaneous references to college news\u2014\nF. A. M. having been a college friend of mine, and seldom seen else\nwhere. (8) The statement that he called his mother Mamma'. As\nambiguous items are to be mentioned:\u2014(1) The statements about\nMr. Hoard and Dr. Bezay, which show a curious mixture of truth and\nerror. (2) The reference to the scar, which has neither been proved\nnor disproved, but is probably erroneous. (3) The \"prank\" episode,\nwhich is possibly true, but probably not. (4) The statements as to\nthe circumstances of his death, which fit very well with all that is\nknown, but cannot be demonstrated. (5) The allusion to Philo, there\nbeing nothing in the context to show what is meant by the word. (6)\nThe fall from the steps. The most important points which are\nwholly false are the statements about Henry Hollis and Frank Eliot,\nabout seeing Mr. Hoard and Dr. Bezay. The case is further com\nplicated by the statements made about Wm. Morton. Phinuit, George\nPelham, and F. A. Morton are responsible for the statement that\nW. Morton \" had light,\" i.e., was a medium. I do not think anyone\ncould draw that inference from Mr. Morton's own performances,\nalthough it is possible that he had some supernormal powers. On the\nother hand there is nothing intrinsically impossible in the supposition\nthat W. Morton both had supernormal powers, and was also an\nhysterical automatist. A somewhat similar problem arises in the case\nof Baker (see Case III).\nCase III.\nKittie Murdoch, involving thai of William Baker.\nIn the spring of 1894 I had the opportunity of studying at length an\ninteresting case of automatic writing. I shall term the subject William\nBaker. Mr. Baker was a man of education and had been known to me\nfor some years. He had dabbled more or less in spiritism, had seen auto\nmatic writing, and had once been told by an automatist that he could\nwrite automatically himself. He tried to do so several times without\nsuccess. In the spring of 1894 he chanced to be at a seance at which\nno professed spiritists were present, and while sitting with his hands\nupon the table, suddenly felt a sharp contraction in his left upper arm.\nThis surprised him, as he had no expectation of any \" manifestations \"\noccurring in connection with himself and was interested in another\nperson present who was supposed to be a medium. The contraction\n\fxxxiv.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 23\npresently disappeared. A few moments later, after walking about the\nroom, he sat down and took a pencil ; immediately the contraction\nrecurred in the right arm ; and the hand made desperate efforts to\nwrite. It produced nothing save scrawls and a few words which\nhappened to be in his mind. That night upon getting home he tried\nagain without success, the hand remaining motionless. The following\nevening he tried again, and after waiting about forty-five minutes\nattempts at writing were made. The words \" Yes \" and \" No \" were\nwritten and questions were answered, but the replies were often incon\nsistent or untrue. Finally the hand spelled out, letter by letter, the\nsyllable m-u-r-d, or at least Mr. Baker so read it. I examined the\nwriting myself carefully and found the letters by no means clear,\nalthough they look more like m-u-r-d than anything else. It then\nflashed into Mr. Baker's mind that a certain lady named Murdoch had\ndied about three weeks before. He had not known her. but knew her\nbrother. As soon as this occurred to him the letters och were rapidly\nwritten, and when asked whether the writer was Miss Murdoch there\nfollowed a series of violent contortions and blows, covering the paper\nwith huge scrawls, and making a \" pool \" of pencil lead in the midst of\nthe sheet. Finally the pencil was driven through the paper and the\npoint broken. Mr. Baker was sure that this demonstration did not\ncome from his upper consciousness, but in view of the later develop\nments of his case I do not think his confidence is entitled to much\nweight. He called my attention to these phenomena and we got Miss\nMurdoch's brother, Mr. Edward Murdoch, to assist us in trying to\ndetermine their origin. At this time the writing was produced slowly\nand with difficulty, only one letter being written at a time and that\nusually only after many attempts. Mr. Baker distracted his attention\nby reading aloud. Nothing was written that would at all suggest the\nactual presence of Miss M. save one sentence :\u2014\"The homefolks have\nforgotten, Ted, before I was dead, how wrong it is to grieve.\" This\nstruck Mr. M. as curious, because the name \" Ted \" was never used\noutside his home, and Mr. Baker had seldom, if ever, heard it. Many\nother statements were made by the hand which were found to be false.\nBefore long the writing became more facile ; other alleged spirits\nappeared and wrote messages which were easily shown to emanate\nfrom no other source than Mr. Baker's own consciousness. This\ndevelopment was attended with various unpleasant symptoms, chiefly\nof a choreic character, and in about three weeks Mr. Baker refused to\nallow his hand to write automatically any more, being convinced that\nspirits had nothing to do with it and that it was having a most\ninjurious effect upon his health.\nWhen I went to Boston for my series of sittings in June of 1894\nI secured the consent of Mr. Murdoch and of Mr. Baker to attempt\n\f24 [part\nWilliam Romaine Newbold.\ngetting into communication with the alleged spirit of Miss M. in order\nto see what explanation, if any, would be offered of Mr. Baker's experi\nences. I said nothing however to Dr. Hodgson of the Murdoch case.\nAt my first sitting of this series, June 20th, 1891, [Present : R. H. and\nW. R. N.] Phinuit asked me whether I knew a \"lady who is a teacher.\nShe is going over her school and college experiences.\" \"Yes,\" I said, \"I\ndo ; ask her to write. \" [I did not then know that she had been a teacher,\nbut the allusion to college led me to reply in the affirmative.] \" Lady who\ntiught,\" said Phinuit, \"is going over things that happened in college. She\nwants to come and thinks she knows you. '' [Miss M. had been a teacher\nfor some years and at the time of her death was attending a well-known\ncollege. Phinuit then slid :] This young lady who used to teach recognises\nyou faintly. Young man [i.e., F. A. Morton] is trying to get her to wake\nup and realise she is talking to you. (How long has she been there ?)\nOnly a few years, long enough to get far from earth and we have to get her\nattention. [Miss M. had been dead about seven weeks.]\nThe following day a curious incident occurred. While experi\nmenting with Mr. Baker I had heard Mr. Murdoch speak of a\ngentleman in such a context as to lead me to suppose that there might\nhave been something in the way of an attachment between him and\nMiss M. I have since learned that this was not true ; that the\ngentleman in question had been dead for several years, and that Miss\nM. had had only the slightest acquaintance with him. I shall term\nhim Morse\u2014the real name is much more unusual. Towards the end\nof the sitting of June 21st [Present: R. H. and W. R. N.] the\nwriter, who was the alleged F. A. Morton, fell into hopeless confusion\nin the midst of which comes the following :\u2014\nHere B . . . what is M O R 1) . . . go [?] to [illegible] with\nit . . . ES . . . MORTIN . . . Na . . .

How do you speak it ... it sounds\nthus . . . He says this and knows what he is saying. (N. : Try to\ngive her name.) [Another mass of confusion without relevance to the\nquestion.]\nOn June 22nd [Present: R. H. and W. R. N.] I asked the F. A. M.\nwriter to find for me the lady who said Morse, and he said he would. On\nthe 23rd [Present : R. H. and W. R. N.] in the midst of an alleged\ncommunication from an aunt of mine given through G. P., there came an\ninterruption . . . Morr . . . Morrsa . . . Errsa\n[Another interruption] Morrs (N. : Does my aunt say this ? ) No .\nhow do you pronounce it sir ? (Morse) Yes exactly.

I cannot tell [?] I'll talk with her and tell you\nall she says about . .\n[While 1 was in Boston I received from Mr. Murdoch by express an old\ncopy of Shakespeare which had belonged to his sister. It contained upon\nthe flyleaf the name of her father, but her own name was not in it. I pro\nduced it at the sitting of the 25th of June [Present : R. H. and W. R. N.]\nand asked G. P. to find the owner. The hand replied :] she taught when in\nthe body and knows this and says she will try to speak to you (Could you\ngive her name ,{) I'll ... I don't believe it because I can scarcely hear\nher, she seems so far away. [Motions to book] let me see this again will\nyou ? [After the writing stopped and Phinuit appeared, I called his atten\ntion to the book, and he said he would find the owner, she taught. Upon\nhis disappearance the right hand and arm were violently convulsed, arm\ntwisted backwards, and the hand pressed in the back between the shoulders,\nthe fingers moving as if to write. I was unable to dislodge the arm. I then\nput pencil in the fingers and paper under the hand against the back ; a few\nscrawls were made, then the arm began to thresh violently about, grasping\nat papers and overturning the table. Becoming more quiet it began writing,\nslowly, and in small characters] Give me my book . . . [illegible]\n(what is your name V) Adelina [I read it] No . . . I cannot . . .\n(Tell me your brother's name) Ed . . . (Would you like to see him ?)\nYes yes [The writing then degenerated into mere scrawling. Hodgson took\nthe pencil from the writer, saying that the light was nearly gone and she\nmust wait until next time. While coming out of trance Mrs. Piper began\ndescribing what she saw.] \" I saw a pretty young lady, she had her hair\ndone up on her head back from her forehead . . . She's leading a little\ngirl by the hand who passed out with a throat trouble, she has light curly-\nhair . . . the lady is not very fair\u2014rather medium. \" [Miss Murdoch,\nI understand, was short, quite stout, and had brown hair, neither very light\nnor very dark. This I did not know at the time. Her two sisters, whom I\ndid know, are fair, and I had pictured her as fair also. She had lost a little\nsister, but the child did not die of a throat trouble, nor had she light curly\nhair. Her hair was light brown with a ripple in it but not noticeably curly.\nI knew nothing of the little sister.]\n[At the opening of the sitting of June 26th [Present : B. H. and\nW. R. N.] Phinuit said] Oh, Hodgson, if you only knew what people said\nof you here ! (What do they say, doctor ?) They say you are a brute,\nHodgson. I tell you that lady won't come back for you now. Why did\nyou speak so roughly to her. [H. expresses his regret and says it was\nnecessary that she should go and she did not do so when asked, etc.] You\nought to coax and not drive her away. George and I have been trying\nto coax her to come but her feelings are hurt and I do not believe\nthat she will. [The book was put on the back of the medium's neck. G. P.\nbegins writing on other topics ; finally I ask him about the lady to whom\nthe book belongs. He asks] \" who is this Elver whom she continually calls\n\f26 [part\nWilliam Romaine Newbold.\nfor 1 [and adds that] Elver is her cousin. [No such person is known.\nIn the confusion which follows May and Alice are mentioned. H. is told to\ngo out and goes. Gr. P. continues :]\nHere she stands and is trying to come close to me . . .

She had no middle name at all.\nI telegraphed to Mr. Edward Murdoch and he came on and was\npresent at the sitting on the following day, June 27th. [Present : Pi. H.,\nW. R. N., and E. M.] Phinuit talked with him for awhile, making\nsundry statements about his health, none of which were strikingly\ncorrect. He also asked him point blank where he lived. The latter\npart of this talk was interrupted by remarks apparently addressed to a\nspirit, such as \" All right, dear, you may, be a good girl,\" and \" Don't\nbe afraid.\" The writing now begins, at first with difficulty. The\nentire sitting is much confused and I give only an abstract.\nMy dearest Eddie [This name has not been applied to E.

Never mind about it.\"] Thank you I just heard it\n[!t appears that Miss M.'s trained nurse was named Miss Bailey, and her\nroom-mate says that she often called her Bailey.

Why dear don't you remember\nthe scarf . . . it is the last thing I ever made dear. [About a half\nhour after this question was written, as nearly as can be ascertained, Miss\nM.'s mother, while going over her things, came across a pink silk scarf\nwhich had been sent her a few months before her death, and noticed how\nneatly it had been hemmed. It was not the last thing she did however.]\nNed, do you remember this . . . this, Ned [touching E. M.'s watch-\npocket in which was her watch] do you dear (Yes.) Thank you dear, don't\ntell these people what I am saying, I never did like to ... I must be\n[used to be ?] a little reserved once in a while, dear.\n[The writer then mentioned \"Kittie Marston or the young girl to whom\nI gave the flowers \"\u2014no such person is known\u2014and asked after John \u2014the\nname is not very distinct,\u2014whether he were well. Her sister was engaged to\na man of this name. When asked whether she had tried to communicate\nthrough Baker she said] yes but I could not speak distinctly dear although I\ntried my best [When the inquirer made it clear that it was of writing we\nasked she said] I tried, yes I do, I took his hand and wrote [Here follow\nscrawls such as Baker's hand made.] (How many times ?)

[M. notes that such terms as \"dear little brother,\"\nwere occasionally but seldom used by his sister. The \" down to the water \"\nmay have reference to the fact that he returned home that night with me by\nboat, although he had not then decided to do so, but the remark is too vague\nto be of value.]\n(M. : Did you give us a message containing the word Ted ,?) Yes . . .\nthis is the very first thing I ever said, T E D, but the rest was not my own\nthought dear [We read it : \"The home folks have forgotten Ted, before I\nwas dead, how wrong it is to grieve.\"] Oh the words are put backwards\n(Is any of it right ?) Yes . . . Yes I said it was wrong to grieve only\nthe folks at home do, and you got it backwards. [We then went over the\nmessage phrase by phrase, and all was accepted except the \" before I was\ndead,\" of which, when asked whether she said it, the writer said] No not\nat all. [Then followed a good many confused allusions, among them one to\na hat she did not like, which is not intelligible. M. asked her whether she\n\fxxxiv.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 2f)\nremembered a certain concert to which she had gone with him and who went\nwith them. This was answered by a series of confused phrases, the gist of\nwhich was that she had written it already on back sheets. It was not there.\nShe also alluded to the names Hayes and Adams. Miss M. was acquainted\nwith persons bearing these names, but not very well. She also said] How\nlong is it since I came here ... I mean when I passed out [at] [here\ncomes the name of the college town in which she died. This name had been\nmentioned during the sitting, but no reference had been made to her having\ndied there. In the conclusion she asked] Where is Abbott (Miss?) Yes\ntell me Ned (What is her first name ?) Kittie [illegible] May . . .\nOh do May ... oh May will you ever understand . . . Jessie\nI send love [(] to Jessie Abbott. [M. remarks that a cousin named\nBessie Abbott (cf. the occurrence of the name Bessie at the beginning of\nthe sitting), was staying at his house at the time of Miss M.'s death, but at\nthis time had left.]\nThe main points of evidence in favour of this communicator's\nidentity with Miss Murdoch are :\u2014(1) Phinuit's point blank allusion\nto the lady who had been a teacher and was going over things that\nhappened at college. (2) The giving of the names Ed, or Ned, May\nand Alice\u2014Miss M. had no other living brothers or sisters than these;\n(3) The giving of her own name as Kittie Murdoch. (4) The allui-ion\nto the scarf. (5) The reference to the watch. (6) The reference to\nBessie Abbott. (7) The allusion to her having died at the college\ntown.\nAgainst the theory of identity are :\u2014(1) The insertion of the\ninitial W. in her name. (2) The description of the little sister as\nhaving died of throat trouble. (3) The statement that \"Elver\" is\nher cousin. (4) The message about the losing of the brooch. (5) The\nreferences to Kittie Marston, and to the hat she did not like. (6) Her\ninability to name the person who went with them to the concert.\n(7) The Morse incident.\nAs ambiguous:\u2014(1) The claim that she knew me only since she\ncame out, which is true but might obviously have been suggested by\nmy question. (2) The claim that she tried to use Baker's hand and her\nasserted recognition of the message which it wrote. (3) The query\nabout the rest of her books. (4) The message to Edward about\nworking too hard, which is true but commonplace. (5) The allusions\nto the picture and brushes. (6) The reference to her own stubborn\nness. (7) The mention of Bailey. (8) The query about her sister's\nhair. (9) The references to Hayes and Adams.\nThe Morse incident calls for special mention. It is the one item in\nmy series of sittings which, although represented as the remark of a\nspirit seen and known to be a spirit by the communicator, is indubit\nably of telepathic origin. I have already told how the name Morse\ncame to be associated in my mind with Miss Murdoch. There is no\n\f30 [part\nWilliam Romaine Newbold.\nconceivable reason why Miss M. or any other spirit should be con\nstantly alluding to a man whom Miss M. had never seen but once or\ntwice, and who had died some years before she did. If, however, we\nsuppose that Mrs. Piper's nervous mechanism merely catches and\nreflects the sitter's own subconscious memories and associations, the\nincident is readily explicable. It is perhaps worthy of note that\nWilliam Morton told me several things which I think he must have\ngot in this way, telepathically from my mind, although they were\npresented to him as the whisperings of distant voices.\nAt a later sitting, November 7th, 1894 [Present: Miss Edmunds]\na few messages were given from the alleged Miss Murdoch, but nothing\nwas said that was either clearly true or false. For further develop\nments in Mr. Baker's case, see below.\nCase IV.\nWilliam Baker.\nAfter getting these statements from the alleged Miss Murdoch, Mr.\nBaker was persuaded to allow some more experiments to be made with\nhis automatic writing. He came to Boston and had a few sittings\nwith Mrs. Piper, or rather was present at a few. George Pelham and\nPhinuit gave him the fullest explanation of his past experiences and\nminute directions for future experimentation.\nHe was, they said, a very fair medium but \" mixed.\" He had\n\"light\" in the thumb, forefinger and middle finger of his right hand,\nand with practice could be made a very good instrument of communica\ntion. George Pelham especially was anxious to get a chance to\nexperiment with him. He was told that he could improve his \"light \"\nby getting into better health and by abstaining from animal food ;\nwhen he wished to try writing he \" should keep perfectly calm, sit in\nas quiet a place as convenient \" and call mentally for G. P. His past\nfailures were due to the fact that his own mind interfered, so that it\nwas almost impossible for the spirit to get his thoughts expressed\nindependently.\nWe then endeavoured, with Mr. Baker's aid, to get some objective\nverification of these statements. Mr. Baker tried automatic writing\nboth in Mrs. Piper's presence and at a distance from her. The writing\nproduced when at a sitting seemed, Mr. B. said, different from that\nwhich he experienced at other times ; the movements were more\nabrupt and were accompanied by tingling sensations which he did not\nfeel at other times. But such sensations cannot be regarded as of any\nevidential value, nor did he so regard them. Our frequent attempts\nto get messages given to the alleged writer by Mr. Baker's hand\n\fxxxiv.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 31\nwritten by Mrs. Piper's hand or vice versa proved absolute failures,\npave in one rather questionable case. Dr. Hodgson asked George\nPelham, referring to Mr. B., \" Did he make any definite request of\nyou?\" The reply was, \"Yes, in this line. Go to this medium soon.\nAll I think of him.\" The last clause, as well as the tenor, seems to\nshow that G. P. has misunderstood the question and supposed it to be,\n\" Did you make any request of him \" ; the last clause then means,\n'This is all I asked, I think, of him.\" This happens to be right, as the\nfirst thing written by Mr. Baker's hand on that occasion was, \" Go to\nBoston soon.\" This single success in the midst of so large a number\nof failures does not amount to much ; it might well have been chance.\nMoreover it is not merely a matter of failures. G. P. claimed that he\nhad often written by Mr. Baker's hand, said that he had heard Mr.\nBaker say this and that, and that he had himself said so and so.\nNone of this was true. It might be alleged that G. P. had no means\nof knowing how much of what he said was understood, and he himself\nonce stated that he thought he understood what was said to him\nbetter than what he said was understood. But in no case did he\nrepeat what was said to him or anything like it. Whence then came\nthe remarks which he claimed that he had heard Mr. Baker and myself\nand others make? Furthermore, he never succeeded in telling what\nMr. Baker was doing at a given time or who was with him when he,\nG. P., attempted communicating, yet he always professed to see it all\nclearly. What then did he see, supposing him to be a spirit ? These\nare questions which the spiritistic theory, as propounded by the\nalleged communicators, does not answer.\nCases V. and VI.\nMrs. Martin and John James Burton.\nEmily Stevenson, a great aunt of mine, married Robert Martin and\nlived in a town about thirty miles from my home. It was rather an\nout of the way place and in course of time we lost sight of her. I\nnever saw her myself until the year 1889 when I went to call upon\nher, introduced myself and was received with open arms. I saw her\nonly once or twice after that ; last in 1891. She died two years later.\n[My connection with her being so slight I was much surprised when\nPhinuit said to me, June 20th, 1894, [present R. H. and W. R. N.,]]do you\nknow who's Mrs. [?] Miss [?] Martin? (I do.) She's an aunt of yours and\nwants to speak to you. (I'd like to hear from her.) You were smaller when\nshe passed out. [She had been dead about fifteen months. The writing\nthen begins and it would seem that a large part of it is supposed to emanate\nfrom Mrs. Martin, but the whole page is much confused and apparently\nmore persons than one are talking.]\n\f32 [PAKT\nWilliam Romaine Neivbold.\n[The writing contains allusions to] My will [which I have been told\ncaused dissatisfaction in the family.]\n\"Ellen,\" \"Emilia,\" and \"Eliza,\" [These are the names of three of Mrs.\nMartin's nieces, two of whom, Ellen and Elizabeth, known as Lizzie, lived\ntogether alone near her, were very intimate with her and were her chief\nlegatees.\nAt the sitting of June 25th there occurs a curious interruption. G. P. is\ntalking of confusion, etc., when the word \"James\" is written several times.\nThe left hand of the medium becomes much convulsed and grasps the right\nhand.

He said that he did, and that,\nafter I left, he had sent me a box of fruit. I cannot learn that he did any\nthing of the kind. He sent his love to his wife and said] she must know I\nlive here and if she changes her place again she will hear from me. [Mrs.\nBurton had been thinking of moving.] (Tell me of your death.) I came\nhere quite suddenly and on account of my head trouble. [Mr. Burton was\napparently in his usual health one morning, but after breakfast complained\nof feeling a little ill ; he lay down on a sofa, soon became unconscious and\ndied later in the day. The cause of death was apoplexy.] (Did you suffer\nat all ? ) No conscious pain at last . . . none although she thought I\ndid. [Mrs. Burton was heard to ask the doctor whether Mr. Burton had\nsuffered any pain.]\n[The next day Phinuit called to me and said :] I want you Billie.\n[Speaking in the name of a spirit] Tell gentleman in the body that, in my\nhazy communication to him in expressing myself I made a mistake. It was\nto Burton's friend Mr. Dycon or Deacon, or\u2014something like that he says,\u2014\nthat the fruit was sent and he mistook you for him. Ask Helen [Phinuit\npronounces the word Heleen]. At first he recalled the circumstances and\nconnected them with you. [When Phinuit said this I had no notion whom\nhe meant. One of Mr. Burton's sons told me that his father was an\nintimate friend of Mr. Anthony Deacon\u2014cf. the Andrew above. I knew Mr.\nDeacon myself very well but did not know that he knew Mr. Burton. Mr.\nDeacon died after a long and painful illness only three days after Mr.\nBurton. The sending him a basket of fruit seems therefore plausible, but\nno one can be found who knows anything about it. Mrs. Deacon thought\nthe words \"Law and Order of the liberty\" might possibly be connected\nwith the fact that Mr. Deacon and Mr. Burton were both officers in the late\nCivil War, members of the Loyal Legion and spent much of their time\ntogether fighting their old battles over. The \"diploma \" may be connected\nwith \"commission.\"]\nThe evidence for the identity of these two communicators taken\nsingly is not strong. Mrs. Martin's name and relation to me is\ndefinitely given ; the other statements ascribed to her are too ambiguous\nto be worth much. In Mr. Burton's case the name and cause of death\nare correctly given. The allusion to Helen is significant, but it is not\ndefinitely stated that she is his wife. To my mind, however, the\ncollocation of these two was one of the most striking facts developed\nin the course of my sittings. My acquaintance with both was so slight\nthat I could scarcely name anyone mention of whom would have\nsurprised me more ; the manner in which Mr. Burton is introduced,\nhis name being first mentioned in what purports to be Mrs. Martin's\nwords as she calls to him to come and speak to me is very curious.\nThe statement that \"your aunt, Mrs. Martin, is connected with\nBurton \" is also noteworthy.\nD\n\f34 [part\nWilliam Romaine Newbold.\nCase VII.\n\"Aunt Sally.\"\n[At the beginning of the sitting of June 24th, (present R.

[I send affectionate messages] Yes and she says\nMartha knows she did, ask her if she remembers what she says . . .\n[Here come confused statements in which the word Morse frequently occurs ;\n(c\/. p. 24) I ask whether my aunt says this word and am told] No. [Finally\nthe hand stops writing and motions to me.

[I explain that my paternal grandfather was\ntwice married, that his second wife had a younger sister whom my father\nmarried many years after his father's death ; she is my mother.

N.) occurred\nthe interruption which I have already given under Case V., p. 32] Cass\n. Carson, the Dr. took away my medicine much against my will yet\nit is all right now. [I supposed at first that this applied to Mr. Burton, but\non inquiry could learn nothing of any doctor of the name in connection with\nhim. Then it occurred to me that an old doctor named Corson had lived\nnot far from our home when I was a child ; I wondered whether he could\nhave had anything to do with my aunt Sally. T knew that she had lived\nnear Philadelphia and had died at a hospital in New York. Upon inquiry I\nlearned that she spent two weeks at our house near New York before going\nto the hospital and was attended by this Dr. Corson. I must have known\nthis at the time but have totally forgotten it. The incident of the medicine\ncannot now be verified. A little later on in the same sitting G. P. writes.]\nSallie wishes to be remembered . . . she thinks everything of you. [I\nwas a great favourite of hers I believe. I asked whether she remembered\nher hymnal which I now have, and the writer said she was] delighted to hear\nthis. [I then asked whether she could tell me what she did just before her\ndeath. I have heard that she sang the hymn \"Nearer, My God, to Thee\"\nand hoped to elicit some reference to it.] Gave her this for you (Gave\nwhom ?) Mattie ... (Is that Mattie '!) No F . . . wait sir\n. . . [Apparently to the spirit.] I can't give it unless you make it plainly\n. . . attie . . . P a 1 1 i e I called her. [This is true. My mother\nis always known as Pattie.

I shall call him Joseph White, and I had fully\nexpected upon any theory, telepathic or otherwise, to get some messages\nfrom him. I was consequently very much surprised to hear almost\nnothing from him. I did not at first, however, make any attempt to open\ncommunication with him. On June 23rd, 1894, G. P. says] who is this uncle ?\n[G. P. proceeds to say quite clearly, although with many repetitions and\ninterruptions, that this uncle calls me Willie and his Will ; that I am his\nnephew, and desires me to give his daughter Edith his love and to say that\nTom her husband will come out all right ; that the bronchial trouble will\ndisappear. That Tom had feared his lungs were affected, but in fact it was\nonly his throat and bronchial tubes. All these names and allusions are\nstrictly pertinent, save that Tom had never supposed that his lungs were\naffected by the cold from which he was then suffering.\nAt the sittings of June 20th, 1895, and June 26th, 1895, I inquired after\nmy uncle, and told G. P. that I desired to communicate with him, but\nwithout success. G. P. claimed to have seen my uncle but informed me]\nd 2\n\f36 [part\nWilliam Romaine Newbold.\nas regards actual communication from him I am afraid you will not get much\nconversation from him as he has been extremely happy here and his\nthoughts have been thus far undisturbed, yet, of course, there will always\nremain a fondness for you, i.e. in his heart.\nCask IX.\nIF. Stainton. Moses.\n[At the sitting of June 19th, 1895, (Present : W. R. N.) George Pelham\nwas telling me how the future state of the soul is affected by its earthly life]\n\u2014It is only the body that sins and not the soul (Does the soul carry with it\ninto its new life all its passions and animal appetites ?) Oh no indeed, not at\nall. Why my good friend and scholar you would have this world of ours a\ndecidedly material one if it were so. (Do you know of Stainton Moses ?) No,\nnot very much. Why ? (Did you ever know of him or know what he did ?)\nI only have an idea from having met him here. (Can you tell me what he\nsaid ?) No, only that he was W. Stainton Moses. I found him for \" E. \" and\nHodgson. (Did you tell Hodgson this ?) I do not think so. (Did he say\nanything about his mediumship ?) No. (His writings claimed that the soul\ncarried with it all its passions and appetites and was very slowly purified of\nthem.) It is all untrue. (And that the souls of the bad hover over the earth\ngoading sinners on to their own destruction.) Not so. Not at [all] so. I\nclaim to understand this and it is empathically not so. Sinners are sinners\nonly in one life.\n[The next day, June 20th, I said] (Can you bring Stainton Moses\nhere ?) I will do my best. (Is he far advanced ?) Oh no, I should say\nnot. He will have to think for awhile yet. (What do you mean ?) Well,\nhave you forgotten all I told you before ? (You mean about progression by\nrepentance ?) Certainly I do. (Wasn't he good ?) Yes, but not perfect by\nany means. (Was he a true medium ?) True, yes, very true. (Had he\nlight ?) Yes. (Yet not all true ?) Yes, but his light was very true, yet he\nmade a great many mistakes and deceived himself. [At the close of the\nsitting I said :] (I want to see Stainton Moses.) Well, if I do not bring him\ndo not be disappointed, because I will if I can find him.\n[On the 21st, I asked again about Stainton Moses.] I cannot bring\nStainton Moses because he is not in my surroundings yet. (Can you explain\nthis further ?) Well, of course I cannot bring every known person here just\nwhen you wish. (How about your surroundings ?) This is a large sphere. I\nhave the doctor after him now [To some forgotten question] No, wait\npatiently and I will wake him up when he arrives. (Is he asleep ?) Oh, B\nyou are stupid I fear at times, your mind is like a lightening . .\nmachine ... I do not mean wake him up in a material sense. (Nor\ndid I.) Well then, old man, don't be wasting light. (I'm not wasting light\nbut I'm bound to find out what you mean.) Well, this is what I wish also.\n(Stainton Moses has been nearly three years in the spirit\u2014a long time.) Yes.\n(Do you mean to say that ho is not yet free from confusion i) No. (Do you\nmean that he will be confused in getting at the medium ?) Certainly, a\nlittle, this is why I use the expression, wake him up.\n\fxXXiv.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 37\n[On the 22nd, Phiuuit said], do you know Billie, George is talking to\nsuch a funny looking man ; he has a long double coat with a large collar and\ncape,\u2014a long beard, large eyes with drooping lids, [fairly shouts with\nlaughter]. George is shaking his fingers at me. He sent me after that\ngentleman. I found him in another part of our world. (Faraway?) It\nwould be a long way to you Billie but not so far to me. George had difficulty\nin having him come but they had a long talk and George made it all right\nwith him. He didn't understand what we wished of him. (Who is he ?) I\ndon't know his name. George called me and sent me after him\u2014you under\nstand Billie\u2014said, \"You go and find him for me, doctor.\" (How did you\nknow whom he wanted?) He said, \"I want you to find a friend of mine\nwho used to be a medium in the body,\" used the light, you know. Oh he\nhas a great deal of light, more than anybody. (Do spirits have light too ?)\nWhat d'you mean Billie ? Spirits are all light. (I mean does a person who\nhas light in the body have in the spirit also more light than others ?) Yes\nindeed. (Tell me how George made you know whom he wanted.) He\ndescribed him. (And his influence ?) Of course. (You know it's very hard\nfor us to believe in spirits at all. Do you remember your life on earth,\ndoctor ?) Oh ye*, but I've been here a very long time. (Did you believe in\nspirits while you were on earth ?) [Phiuuit gives a short derisive laugh.]\nNot much. Not I. (Then you should sympathise with us.) Oh, I can't put\nmyself in your place. [The above description of S. M. answers to the notion\nI had of him at the time, derived from portraits.]\n[G.

(I will certainly.) Also Myers (Yes\nindeed) whom I remember well (Yes I certainly will) all right. I had a\nspirit once named Wallace. You never knew did you V (No I didn't.)\nHe was one of my guides when on earth. (What name did you give\nhim, i.e., .) Rector, and not Dr. as I had explained to some friend\nof yours. Rector was ( 1 ) Yes distinctly, he was Rector. (Who\nwas Doctor ? ) Not Wallace, but a Dr. whom I used to know at college.\n[R. H. pronounces and spells the name over.] Yes sir. It is very singular\nhow the names of my former friends and guides run in my mind . . .\nrun through my mind just now, at this moment. (Mr. Moses, I wish to\ntell you something that will interest you. Mr. F. W. H. Myers, whom you\nknew) quite (has been publishing a full account of your life experiences\nin the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research.) Viz., S.P.R.\ngood ... oh glad I am to meet you here ... 1 will help\nyou in your work. (We shall be glad indeed. I wish to ask you one\nimportant question) let me clear up all m}' thoughts and I will help you.\n(Do you wish to write your own thoughts or answer questions ? ) I would\nlike to become acquainted with these conditions. (Good.) Myers what\nabout Myers. (Myers has been publishing a record of your experiences and\nhas referred to Rector, Doctor and Imperator, but explains that the persons\nwhom these names represented are not to be mentioned.) Private. (But I\nunderstand that Myers knows.) Yes, he mud. (We are not going to\n\f40 William Romaine Newbold. [part\npublish them.) Do not. (But you understand if we tell Myers who\nImperator is, it will be strong test of your identity.) Yes . . . Rector\n. . . I know . . . the name was taken expressly for distinction,\ni.e., to distinguish one from the other, and Dr. was Dr. whom I knew\nvery well at college. (Could you tell us, if it will be kept private, who\nImperator was ? ) T should hope so. Question, I did not catch sir. (Can\nyou tell us who Imperator was ? ) Certainly, a young lady friend of mine.\n(Are you sure ? 1 mean the famous communicator from the spirit world\nwhom you spoke of as Imperator.) Oh no, but she in my spirit teachings\nis mentioned. (I mean the Imperator also mentioned in your Spirit\nTeachings.) Yes. Yes. Must I tell you who it was. (Let me explain.\nI wish you to use your own judgment. Mr. Myers knows) he does (and we\ndo not know. Nobody in the United States knows. If you tell us and we\nsend it to Myers privately, it will be a very good test of your identity, being\ninformation to him which nobody possesses on this side of the water.)\n. ( ? ) Certainly. ( 1 ) Yes. Now I know wherein I s1ieak.\nI never during my illness when being helped by him told or divulged his\nname to anyone and I only left it written ( ) in my MSS. (Very good,\nMr. Moses. This will be a splendid test) in or among my private papers.\n(Good. That's first rate.) No more sir. (You are getting exhausted, aren't\nyou ?) [Here the left hand becomes convulsed and rubs Mrs. Piper's right\ncheek in a manner characteristic of Phinuit.] I wish to change my position\nsir if you please. (Yes, do so.) Help me to remain here I wish very\nmuch to continue my remembrances. (Yes, we shall be very glad too.) I\nremember Mrs. Speer very well. [While the last sentence was being written\nPhinuit remarks to Newbold :] \"That gentleman's a nice fellow, he's a\nclergyman.\" Give my love to all on earth. . . . yes . . . who can\ndeny my existence ... oh my existence I say, who can deny that I\nexist?

What was the origin\nof this mistake about evil spirits taking possession of men and leading them\non to do wrong ?) Experience here has taught me the difference. This was\nmore my own theory. (You mean that when you were in the body you\nmisunderstood the communications 1) Yes often, especially when I was not\nfeeling well. (The thoughts of the communicating spirit got confused with\nyours ?) I mean of course to go back to the body i.e. to go back to my\nearthly experience . . . Yes and not so much that altogether as that I\nmisunderstood. (You misunderstood yourself, so to speak.) Certainly,\nmaterially. (You had your own theory and misinterpreted the communi\ncator's meaning ?) Yes exactly, as I thought this very strongly I felt sure of\nhaving been told this. (Were all those physical phenomena that you got\ndue to spirits ?) No not all. They were due to material causes, etc. as well.\n(Do you mean persons in the body produced them ?) Not at all, I mean to\nsay that from the energy which they took from my own body, medium power\netc. they were moved. (Were they moved by the action of spirits ?) Action\nof spirits ? Oh yes. (I'll state my impression. Certain spirits used the\n\"electrical\" in connection with your body to produce the physical\n\fxxxiv.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 41\nmovements.) Yes, this is what they did. Objects etc. raps ... (If\nyou have anything special to say to us we shall be glad to hear it, but\nif not, we have something especial which we wish you to do for us.)\nWell [writing begins to look dreamy] I must say that I will have many\nthings special to say to you, but I am forced to admit that this is all new\nto me now and it seems very strange indeed ... I am (we shall be\ngrateful to you for help in proving to the world the truth of spirit com\nmunications.) Yes, glad I will be to be able. (Can't read that word)\nenabled to communicate, giving tests etc. in my own language. (Do you\nthink you could translate some Greek into English ?) Do what ? Greek\n. . . why I used to be as familiar with Greek as English. (Better\nwait for next time.) Well, yes. (Think up your Greek and the next\ntime we will give you some to translate. Everybody knows that the\nmedium does not know Greek and if you could translate some for us it\nwould be good proof) what could a medium have to with me and my\nGreek. [R. H. explains further that proofs must be got that the medium's\nmanifestations are not fraudulent.] Well I suppose they said the same\nof me. (Mr. Moses, aren't the conditions getting strange ? Don't you\nthink you had better go now and come to us another time 1) Yes I do\n[scrawls] auf wiederseheu (auf wiedersehen.)\nIn this case we have the difficulties which attach to the spiritistic\ntheory brought out in the highest relief. The general tenor of the\ncommunications, the allusion to Mr. Speer, the reception of the names\nof Myers and Hodgson, have an air of verisimilitude. The communi\ncator then gives us, with the most solemn asseveration of their accuracy\nand with apparent consciousness of the importance of his statements to\na cause which he had in life much at heart, three names which the\nreal Mr. Moses must have known and which of all possible things\nwould seem to be the hardest for the spirit to forget\u2014the names\nof the spirit friends who, as he claims, opened his eyes while still\non earth to the realities of the eternal life. And not one of those\nnames is true or has the least semblance of truth ! Furthermore,\nof all the points touched upon during the sitting this was the only\none that was unknown to both the sitters\u2014another item in favour\nof the telepathic theory. To my mind this failure on the part of\nthe alleged Moses is an obstacle to the acceptance of the spiritistic\ntheory which has not as yet been set aside and which must be\nsatisfactorily explained before that theory can be regarded as meet\ning the requirements of the case.\nCases X. and XI.\nAaron James and Albert Bonney.\n[Sitting of January 27th, 1896. Present: W. R. N. and Mrs.\nEdith Waldron, the latter for the first time and under assumed\nname.]\n\f42 [part\nWilliam Romaine Neivbold.\nAt the outset of the sitting Phinuit made the most remarkably\ncorrect diagnosis that I have ever seen him make. He told Mrs. W.\nthat she suffered much from flatulent dyspepsia, that she got dizzy\nsometimes and sometimes fell or felt like falling, all of which was due\nto dyspepsia. That she was subject to severe attacks of despondency.\nAll this is literally true, and as Mrs. W. is vivacious and seems in the\nbest of health, I do not think it could have been got from any\nsuperficial inspection. Phinuit then told her that her mother suffered\nfrom a cough, was very \"positive,\" sometimes a little too \"positive,\"\nthat her father was a good man but \"a little cranky from his\nrheumatism \" which occasionally made him cross. This is also\nstrictly true.\n[G. P. begins writing. After a warm welcome to me and a few words on\nsundry topics I asked for Mrs. W.'s relatives, to me wholly unknown save\nby name, and even of their names I know little.] Oh, I see. Yes. There\nfirst of all is a gentleman who is a relative of hers [lighter pressure in\nwriting and smaller script.] Come nearer, sir, do not fear. You will be\nable to clear your thoughts. [To me.] Will you not leave your place for\nher ? [Mrs. W. takes her place by the writing hand.] Thanks. He says\nAsk this little lady if she remembers UNCLE. [Then follows confusion\nconnected with me. Then :] George. [Following statement seems due to\nG. P. 's misunderstanding speaker; cf. below.] Yes I am he. Fire away\nold man.

Give me one little answer . .\n[We ask who this Charles is.] Charles in the body. [Apparently an uncle\nof Mrs. W. 'sand nephew of speaker's wife.] And I wish you to speak to\nme and let me get a little clearer . . . Love to Charles ... he is\nstill with you. [Here comes more confusion in which several of my former\ncommunicators seem to be trying to slip in a word edgewise ; in the course\nof it occur the curious expressions.] Speak to him for heaven's sake. Let\nhim throw off his mantle. [It concludes with.] Your father . . . who\nin thunder is George. [Pointing to E. W.] He says your father. (Yes.)\nWell I thought all the time he was speaking to me . . . calling me\nI thought JAMES . . . yes I am his brother . . . Barker\n... I know George Barker and I am his UNCLE JAMES.

What has become of Mary Bacon ? [Mrs.\nWaldron's father is George Barker. His mother's sister married one Aaron\nJames who was always known to his nephews as Uncle James.

I\nwas a level-headed man. [This is very significant. Mr. James was a\nclergyman ; he became interested in spiritism and carried it to great excess,\nso much so that in the later years of his life he was regarded by his relatives\nas not quite sane.]\nDo you remember me little girl. [She never saw him. But immediately\nafter this comes a mass of confusion in which Mr. James' remarks seem to\nbe mixed with those of the communicator who next comes to the front, and\nare interpeised with a few of G. P.'s words, as \" cannot quite hear you,\"\n\"who in thunder is he talking about.\" This other communicator knew\nMrs. W. very well. It begins to get more coherent.] I wish to enquire for\nyour mother . . . yes . . . also Mary.

She loves me still and\nwill do a great deal for you. You will see her soon. (E. W. : Is she\ncoming to see ine ?) Yes. [Untrue of his wife.] Very happy, as happy as\nI could be without her . . . [Remark forgotten.] Well I know that\nwell and I wish my wife Mary to know that I am alive.

[There was no insurance.] (Was there\nanything you were very fond of ?) [This question was asked with the horse\nin mind ] I told you about this long ago viz. HORSE and you kept calling\nit house. [This was true ; it occurred amongst the confusion which I have\nnot transcribed. He had an old horse of which he was very fond. In con\nnection with it came the sentence \"Go and see Austin.\"] (W.

Alfred Bonney. I want everybody to know.\nThe striking points in favor of the theory of identity are : ( 1 )\nThe statement that Mrs. Waldron's father is named George. (2) That\nthe speaker is his uncle James. (3) The emphatic and characteristic\nstatement ascribed to \" Uncle James \" : \"I know now the whole\nworld is thought, develops with reason,\" and the allusion to his belief\nin spiritism while living. (4) The allusion to the horse. (5) The\ngiving correctly the relationship of Mrs. Waldron to Albert Bonney.\n(6) The mention of heart trouble as the cause of Albert Bonney's\ndeath. (7) The allusions to trout fishing.\nAs ambiguous : (1) A statement that Edith is his sister's child,\nwhereas she was his wife's sister's grandchild. (2) The allusion to\nCharles in the body. (3) The mention of the name \" Barker\" which\nhad been mentioned in a former sitting and might have been guessed.\n(4) The allusion to Joseph. (5) The giving of the name \" Alfred\nBonney,\" which was, unfortunately, mentioned during the sitting.\n(6) The allusion to \" Old Tom.\"\nAs untrue and pro tanto against the theory of identity : (1) The\nallusion to Mary Bacon. (2) The allusion to what Albert Bonney\nasked his wife to do for him before he left the body. (3) The\nreference to Austin, (4) The reference to \"Old Tom.\" (5) The\nstatement that he passed out in a chair. (6) The statement about his\nbequests.\n\fxxxiv.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 45\nCase XII.\nMr, Parker.\nOn November 7th, 1894, Miss Edmunds submitted to Phinuit, at\nmy request, certain articles belonging to a relative of mine who has\nbeen living abroad for a number of years, and whom I shall term\nMrs. Parker. She has had many experiences of an apparently\nsupernormal order, and I had hoped that the Mrs. Piper communi\ncators might in some way manifest themselves to her. The articles\nwere incorrectly ascribed by Phinuit, who had been informed at\nthe outset that they had been sent by me, to Fred Morton and\nMiss Murdoch. On the following day a person unknown to me was\nhaving a sitting, and in the course of it the following remark was\ninterpolated :\u2014\nMr. Packer [?] (Is that name Packer ?) No, Parker desires to send hia\nlove to his wife in the body.\n[Mrs. Parker's husband haB been dead some years. She secured a divorce\nfrom him some years before his death. I communicated these facts to her\nbut she made no comment thereupon.]\nCase XIII.\nApparent Knowledge of Foreign Languages.\nFrequently in my sittings George Pelham used French and Latin\nwords and phrases\u2014e.g., \"inter nos\" (June 20th, 1895), \"coup de\nmain\" (June 21st, 1895), \" de die in diem \" (June 22nd, 1895). This\nlast phrase I could not decipher until the writer added \" from day to\nday.\" Then I read it and added, \"I never saw that phrase before.\"\n\"Well,\" the hand replied, \"I never saw it, it just popped into my\nmind.\" This is found in Webster's Dictionary in the list of foreign\nwords and phrases.\n[At the sitting of June 20th, at which I was alone, immediately after the\noccurrence of the words \"inter nos \" I said with reference to the matter in\nhand, (no one knows but Hodgson.)] Hodgson, what the old chap, Fama\n. . . [I thought of the well-known passage in Virgil beginning with the\nword and said, jokingly,] (Hello, you've not forgotten your Virgil, George ?)\n[The hand pounded excitedly and continued,] tempus viat\u2014vivat G.P. [With\nunpardonable stupidity, I failed to look closely at this, merely catching the\ngeneral sense, and went on with the sitting.]\nWhile deciphering this sitting I noticed that this sentence made\nno sense as it stood ; it occurred to Dr. Hodgson to look in the list of\nquotations in a dictionary, and there we found the original \" Fama\nsemper vivat.\" At the sitting of June 22nd, at which I was again\nalone, I asked G. P. about this with very unsatisfactory results. G. P.\n\fWilliam Bomaine Newbold. [part\ntranslated it, \" May his fame live for ever.\" In spite of my constant\nquestions, he was unable to note that \"semper\" should be substituted\nfor \" tempus.\" On June 21st [Present : W. R. N. and H. W. 0.] I\ntried to get the motto of the Tavern Club (of Boston), and was given a\nmedley of almost illegible scrawls in which I thought I could decipher\nthe words, \"offere,\" \"datum,\" \"due,\" and \" vir.\" When I asked\nwhether this was \"due vir,\" the writer assented, and assented also to\nmy translation, \" Hero, go ahead,\" or, \" Lead the way.\" This has no\nresemblance to the motto of the Tavern Club.\n(Will you translate Greek for me ?) Certainly Greek. (You remember\nit 1) I ought to. [I then said the first scrap of Greek that happened to\ncome into my head : \u2014ndrtp ripoiv 6 iv rois oipavnh.] (Did you catch it?)\nNo, not exactly, slowly, (riarep.) Parter ... I say . . . Pae\nPater . . . pater . . . good (fjfiiav) hemon\n[illegible] he . . . hemon . . . urano is . . . and translation\n. . .

Hand\ngesticulates and twists so as to get O 's mouth close to outer side of hand\njust below the root of little finger.] My ear. [I explain he means that his\nspirit ear is located there.] Certainly, my ear . . . E M O .\nthat is what bothers me . . . Father is . . . was . . . now\n. . . no . . Father . . . our. [Quickly and with excite\nment.] OUR O U. [Then slowly and reverently, in capital letters.]\nOUR FATHER IS IN HEAVEN. (Good.) [We all shake\nhands over it.] (W. N. : We generally put it, \" Our Father who art in\nheaven.\") [Excitement.] Yes, I remember that too. Well, if you only\nknew how difficult it is to catch the sound of your voices you would wonder\nhow I could speak at all to you because I have difficulty in making you\nhear also, when a thing is very clear to me. (Shall we try another ?) One\nmore (Shall it be in Latin ?) . . . yes. (What pronunciation did\nyou use, Roman, English, or Continental ?) Roman. I asked for Greek,\nbut never mind old chap . . . wait ... I am not quite satisfied\n. But you mentioned the fact which I wished to explain. (Go\nahead then and explain.) [Slowly.] WHO ART IN . . . O.K.\nfire away . . . [We have scarcely given the new sentence Tu iie\ncede malis sed contra aitdentior ito before G. P. changes the subject by\nintroducing two or three Latin and French words which he knows will\n\fxxxiv.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 47\nbe significant to me but not to Mr. O . He then asks that Mr. 0\nshould go out, and begins writing upon a topic which he does not wish\nhim to know of.]\nThis case is more significant than the others because it does seem that the\nwriter has some knowledge of Greek, whereas the familiar phrase before used\nmight be picked up by anybody. It is also difficult to explain this transla\ntion by the telepathic theory. The writer seems not to recognise the familiar\nwords but to translate afresh from the words he hears ; if it were merely\nreflected from my mind one would hardly expect it to take this new form.\nIn order to test G. P.'s knowledge of Greek still further I wrote a sen\ntence, making the first three words give the keynote of the whole, using\nvery simple and familiar words, and purposely choosing the thought from the\ngroup that was uppermost in the minds of the writers. The sentence was :\u2014\nOvk eort Bdvaros, ai yap rtov $vt]Tcov yjrvxai \u00a3o)rlv \u00a3uhtiv aQavarov, didtoy,\nfuiKupiov. We first gave this to G. P. at the sitting of June 25th, 1805\n[Present : R. H. and W. R. N.]. At our suggestion G. P. calls the alleged\nMr. Moses to help translate it. The result is confusion worse confounded.\nApparently the writers cannot hear what we say, Odvarot is at first written\nfanvis. In this confusion words and sentences occur which appear to\nemanate from Moses, such as \" I could in time recall all the Greek I ever\ntaught and why should I not,\" \"It seems like awaking from a dream to\nrecall this to mind.\" When the writer finally gets the word ovk he translates\nit \"light,\" apparently from association with the Latin word \"lux.\" On\nJune 26th and 27th, further unsuccessful attempts at translation were made.\nG. P. said that he remembered his Greek well enough when he was away\nfrom the \"light\" but the effort of communicating confused him and drove\nit out of his head. On July 1st, at a sitting at which Dr. Hodgson only was\npresent, and in the midst of a communication from G. P. upon another\ntopic, the following interruption occurs :\u2014\nWho said there was no death ? [Hand moves forward as though \" speir-\ning\" into the \" vacant space.\"] Moses (Ask Moses what he means by that.)\nWell, you interrupt me. Well, I must say old chap (I did not mean to\ninterrupt you.) No not you H . . . Moses . . . Ouk esti thanatos.\nMoses (that's first rate. Is this Mr. Moses translating ?) Ouk esti thanatos.\nThere's no death. Repeat it to me in Greek Hodgson for him. [R.H.\nrepeats, says it is correct and suggests getting the rest of the passage\ntranslated.] Come H. Come here a moment. Hurry up H. [R. H.\nrepeats the rest of the passage.]\nAgain . . . Good oh good may God preserve you always H., and\nkeep you alive on earth until you have accomplished a thorough work. I'll\nhelp you in every way possible (Shall I repeat the Greek again ?) Yes, some\nthing new . . . Yes he's listening . . . too fast H . . . wait\n. . . ready he has it very nearly . . . not the last H ... no\nbefore . . . yes . . . not quite . . . got it. [R. H. had\nbeen repeating the first five words only several times.] I'll go now and\ntranslate it and return sir.\nThis promise was never kept and we heard no more of the Greek. At\nlater sittings other matters came to the front and Moses did not reappear to\ncomplete the translation.\n\f48 [part\nWilliam Ronudne Newbold.\nAt a sitting held June 27th, 1895, .at which I alone was present,\nG. P. told me that he had understood Romanic (sic) and a little Celtic,\nand told me to ask Mr. Howard about it. Dr. Hodgson asked about\nthe Romanic and found that Mr. Howard knew nothing whatever\nabout it. G. P. spent some time in Ireland and wrote a book on Irish\naffairs.\nCase XIV.\nApparent Clairvoyance or Telepathy.\nSeveral times I got apparent evidence for the acquisition of know\nledge in some supernormal way which seemed to suggest rather\ntelepathy or clairvoyance than extraneous intelligences. Thus\n(June 20th, 1894, present R. H. and W. R. N.) Phinuit said to me :\u2014\nWho is this Edith in your surroundings. (There are several.) Yes, I\nknow it [Counts on fingers] one, two, three. This is the young one, dark\nhair, pretty complexion, nice young lady. [This struck me at the time as a\ndescription of a young cousin of mine as I last sow her. She is usually\nlacking in colour, but was then flushed with exertion.]\nAt another time, on or about June 26th, 1894, while in Dr.\nHodgson's study, I picked up a volume of poems by G. P. with a\npreface by Rogers. I had not known that G. P. had written poems,\nand exchanged a few words with Dr. Hodgson about it. At the\nsitting of the 27th, Dr. Hodgson was endeavouring to get from G. P.\nsome evidence of having heard a message which he had tried to give\nhim. The writer seemed to know nothing about it, but wrote :\u2014\nNo,\u2014but I did hear you tell about the memoriam Rogers . . . [We\nmake some remark.] Yes, I caught it as you were telling him and it\nattracted me.\nJust a year later a similar incident occurred. As the alleged\nWalter Scott was concluding a sitting he told me that there were\nmonkeys in the sun. That night while writing up the sitting at Dr.\nHodgson's rooms, ten miles from Mrs. Piper, Dr. Hodgson and I fell\nto laughing over this preposterous statement ; so loudly indeed did we\nlaugh that I finally cautioned Dr. H. that we would be wakening the\nwhole block. The next morning the writer, without my saying any\nthing about it, explained that he did not mean to say there were\nmonkeys in the sun; the light of the medium was failing him and gave\nrise to this error. He meant to say that we would follow the light\nof the sun as far as the tropic of Capricorn and there we would see the\nmonkeys flying in and out of sand caves. I do not see that this\nexplanation betters the matter very much.

H.]\nv.\n\f50 [part\nFrank Podmore.\nIII.\nDISCUSSION OF THE TRANCE-PHENOMENA OF\nMRS. PIPER.\nI.\u2014By Frank Podmoke.\nIn considering the phenomena presented by Mrs. Piper's trances, I\ndo not propose to follow Dr. Hodgson in his speculations on the ultimate\nsignificance of the trance-utterances. Not indeed that those specula\ntions can fairly be held illegitimate, or even premature. It is difficult,\nindeed, to discuss the coriJ(\u00bbirr^-thes^~i5l*\u00abr^nces at all apart from the\ndramatic form in whiotwt&ey are cast ; ^n'd^k would be ridiculous to\npretend that the invari\u00bbHe assumption by tn^estranced Mrs. Piper of\nan alien personality-+-a perAjR^tfj* ^ft^gQ-galiseclJwith startling fidelity\n\u2014is a fact wholly ^iffcout evidential weighty But before entering\nupon the difficult probi^ms\/suggested by these^irramatic impersonations,\nthere is a preliminary qne^ti&\u00a3$oAbTSj^*<xi \u2014a question which Dr.\nHodgson himself, and those other members of the Society whose\nacquaintance with Mrs. Piper's trances has given them the best right\nto form an opinion\u2014to wit, Professor William James, Professor\nOliver Lodge, Mr. Frederic Myers and Dr. Leaf\u2014have already\nanswered to their own satisfaction. But it is well, perhaps, in view\nof the importance of the issues now clearly seen to be involved, that\nthis preliminary question should once more be definitely stated, and\nthe answer already given, as above indicated, be reviewed. In brief,\nis it certain that we have to deal with supernormal faculty\u2014 say\ntelepathy, to put it at its lowest\u2014at all ? Is it not conceivable that\nthe whole of the information given in the trances may have been\nacquired by normal means, either by unconscious elaboration of hints\nundesignedly furnished by the sitter, or by a deliberate system of\nprivate inquiry 1\nNow the obvious preliminary remark is that Mrs. Piper does not\nstand alone. She is a member of a large class. Clairvoyante mediums\nof one type or another have been numerous, since, at any rate, the\ndays of Mesmer. And, speaking generally, the claims put forward\nby them, or on their behalf, have been the same as the claims now\nadvanced for Mrs. Piper\u2014the power of diagnosing and prescribing for\nthe diseases, even of absent persons ; of seeing events and places at a\ndistance ; and of communicating with the world of spirits.\n\fxxxiv.] Discussion of Trance-Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 51\nBut in attempting to compare the utterances of Mrs. Piper with\nthose of previous mediums, we encounter at the outset a serious\u2014and\nin most cases an insuperable\u2014difficulty, the meagreness, namely, of\nthe records. Of some clairvoyants, no doubt, no such deficiency can be\nasserted ; he would be an insatiable student, indeed, who would demand\nan ampler unfoldrneut of the Arcana Caeleslia ; or would desire to add\nto the volumes of the Great Harmonia. But whatever the philosophic or\ntheologic value of the utterances of Emanuel Swedenborg and Andrew\nJackson Davis \u2014and in ranking the two names together as members of\nthe same class no comparison of the two men, or judgment on their\nrespective systems, is intended to be conveyed\u2014it is clear that their\nwritings offer little external evidence to support their claims to inspira\ntion. Some few instances, indeed, are alleged in which Swedenborg\nclairvoyantly became aware of events at a distance ; but it would\nscarcely be profitable at the present time to inquire into the sufficiency\nof the evidence. And I am not aware that Davis' claims to the\npossession of information supernormally acquired have ever been\nsubstantiated in concrete cases. Again, there were many German\necstatics in the first few decades of the present century, of whom the\nSeeress of Prevorst may be taken as the type, whose delineation of the\nspiritual spheres, journeys to the moon and the interstellar spaces, and\nthe like, fill many closely printed volumes. But here, again, evidence\nfor terrestrial clairvoyance, though not altogether wanting, is hardly\nsufficient to call in itself for serious consideration. With these excep\ntions then, which are scarcely profitable for our present purpose, the\nrecords of clairvoyance are for the most part both meagre and sporadic;\nso that we are unable to judge how much of the alleged success might\nhave been due to information surreptitiously obtained at the time from\nthe sitters themselves ; nor what proportion of the statements made\non any single occasion were correct, and what were inaccurate or\nirrelevant; nor again have we any data for estimating the proportion of\nsuccessful and unsuccessful sittings. Naturally, it is \"good\" sittings\nwhich are recorded ; the rest are forgotten. Moreover, an additional\nelement of uncertainty is introduced by the fact that the accounts\ngiven are frequently undated, and were certainly in many cases written\ndown months or years after the events. In a few cases, however,\nthere seems to have been a fairly full record of the sittings of some\none medium, based upon contemporary notes. In no case, indeed,\nwith which I am acquainted, does the record profess to approach,\nin accuracy or completeness, the practically verbatim series of reports\nedited by Dr. Hodgson. But in a few cases\u2014of which the best known\nare Mr. Stainton Moses, Alexis Didier, and Adele Maginot\u2014the\naccounts given are sufficiently full and appear to have been prepared\nwith sufficient care to admit of some useful comparison being made.\n2 E\n\f52 [part\nFrank Podmore.\nI propose then to give a brief outline of each of these series of trance-\nutterances, in its purely evidential aspect, and to consider how far the\ninformation displayed can plausibly be assigned to normal sources.\nSome account of the alleged spirit communications made through\nthe medium of Stainton Moses\u2014based almost exclusively on his own\nstatements of what took place\u2014is given by Mr. Myers in Proceedings,\nVol. XL, pp. 24-113. To the comments made by Mr. Myers I\nhave to add one important detail, viz., that all the information as\nto the names, ages and dates of death of the three Jones children\nwhich was given at the seance of February 10th, 1874, had, it\nhas since been ascertained, appeared in the obituary column of the\nTimes (London) on February 4th, 1874, six days before the seance.1\nIn the article referred to, 38 spirits are enumerated as having com\nmunicated through the medium of Stainton Moses, either by raps\nor by automatic writing. Of these 38 communicators, 8 or 9 had\nteen personages of some historical importance ; 13 were individuals\nof no special distinction apparently unknown even by name to Mr.\nMoses or any of the circle ; the remainder had been personal acquaint\nances of the medium or of the Speer family, who formed the usual\nsitters. The historical personages sometimes signed their names in\nhandwriting which was reported to be more or less characteristic, and\nsometimes communicated facts in their life history which could have\nbeen ascertained, and were actually verified, by reference to their\nbiographies ; the unknown persons gave their names, the date of their\ndeath, and the disease of which they died, in many cases reproducing\nverbatim the obituary notice which had appeared shortly before in the\ndaily papers. Of the personal friends, one was a friend of Mrs. Speer,\nof whom Mr. Moses writes that he had never previously heard ; the\nonly facts given were the initials and surname in full\u2014A. P. Kirkland.\nAnother was a sister of Dr. Speer, who had died as an infant before\nhis birth ; three Christian names and a surname and particulars as to\nthe death were eventually given. Other relations of the Speers gave\ntheir names and relationship correctly ; the medium's grandmother and\nother friends conversed with him, and gave him particulars of incidents\nknown to him, or subsequently verified.\nFinally, in one of Mr. Moses' notebooks there were discovered, after\nhis death, communications from President Garfield and a well-known\nlady, called by Mr. Myers \" Blanche Abercromby,\" which communica\ntions purported to have been made in each case some hours before news\nof the death had reached Mr. Moses through ordinary channels.\nSetting aside the last two facts\u2014for which we have no other\nevidence than the medium's own statement\u2014there is nothing to\n1 See Prncerdings, Vol. XL, pp. 75-90.\n\fxxxiv.] Discussion of Trance-Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 53\nforbid the supposition that the whole of the information given at these\nseances was the reproduction of facts consciously or unconsciously\nacquired by the medium from the daily papers, from books, or from\nconversations with his friends.\nNor do the alleged communications, it is interesting to note, bear\nin most cases any marked resemblance to those made through Mrs.\nPiper's organism. Apart from the initial difference that Mr. Moses'\nspirits mostly communicated by raps, and, when they wrote, wrote not\ninfrequently in a hand simulating the characteristic handwriting of\nthe alleged communicator, it is to be remembered that the names, dates\nand other obituary particulars, which is practically all of an evidential\nnature that the \" spirits \" offer, are precisely the details which are\nleast conspicuous in Mrs. Piper's trance utterances ; whilst conversely\nDr. and Mrs. Speer do not seem to have been favoured with any of the\ncuriously subtle character sketches, personal descriptions, odd bits of\nold family history, etc., etc., which form the staple of the later\nmedium's communications.\nThere have been numerous exponents in England of \" travelling \"\nclairvoyance, especially in the decade 1840-1850. But the records are\nin most cases fragmentary and sporadic, or contain too little detail.\nOf one clairvoyant medium of that period, however, we have several\ntolerably full records by competent observers ; and the fact that the\nclairvoyant was well paid for his performances, and that some of his\nphenomena, at any rate, were almost without question to be accounted\nfor by the exercise of normal vision, render his case a valuable one for\nour present purposes.\nAlexis Didier was a young Frenchman who was brought to this\ncountry in the summer of 1844 and exhibited by one Marcillet, whom\nElliotson and others vouched for as a gentleman of high character and\nundoubted integrity. Alexis was apparently in the first instance\nthrown into a deep trance ; his eyes were then bandaged, generally as\nfollows :\u2014A pad of leather would be placed over each eye, and then\ntwo handkerchiefs would be tied diagonally across ; over these a third\nhandkerchief would be tied horizontally, and the interstices would\nbe filled up with cotton wool. In these circumstances he would play\necarte with great skill and rapidity ; would know not only his own\ncards but frequently those in his adversary's hand as well ; would\nplay correctly with his own cards face downwards on the table ;\nwould frequently, by request, pick out any named card when the\nwhole pack was face downwards. Further he would\u2014 though generally\nwith his eyes unbandaged and merely closed\u2014read words written\nin sealed envelopes, describe the contents of closed packets, and read\nwords and sentences several pages deep in any book which might be\npresented to him.\n\f54 [PAltT\nFrank Podmore.\nFrom the detailed descriptions of these performances given by\nvarious observers in the Zoist itself and in the periodical literature of\nthe time, we can gather many indications that the power exercised\nby Alexis was perfectly normal.1 In any case bandaging such as that\ndescribed could not have been accepted as satisfactory. But a writer\nin the Morning Chronicle tells us that he had himself been bandaged\nby a friend in the same way and had managed to read distinctly. It\nwas noticed, moreover, by several persons that Alexis contorted his face\nboth during and after the process of bandaging ; that he frequently\ntouched or fidgeted with the bandages ; that he held the objects given\nto him at curious angles, and often changed their position as if trying\nto get a better view ; envelopes and closed paper packages would be\ncarried, for instance, to the stomach or the top of the head. Moreover,\nthe card-playing appears to have been the only form of experiment\nwhich was pretty uniformly successful ; even here there were\nmany failures, but the failures seem to have predominated over the\nsuccesses in other cases. He appears to have selected the packages\nwhich he was to read from amongst a large number presented to him ;\nthe contents of sealed envelopes could not be read in the hands of a\nsceptic\u2014the seal must be broken and the contents shown to a\nsympathetic witness. Marcillet was present in the room throughout\nthe performance. Of all the feats, that of reading the words several\npages deep in a book was the most strongly suggestive of trickery.\nThis appears not to have been attempted, as a rule, until Alexis had\nalready read some words on the open page, the book in his hand, with\nthe text covered by a piece of paper or a handkerchief placed there by\nhimself. Alexis would then separate a number of pages, from ten to\n150, holding them edgeways before him, and offer to read some words\non a particular part of the page several pages further on. It is not\nstated in any account which I have seen whether Alexis or the\naudience chose the particular spot on the page ; but it is certain that\nAlexis could not indicate with even approximate correctness the\nnumber of pages deep. In one case the words read were found 80\nand 150 pages further on respectively.\nIf this were all that Alexis had to show, we could only wonder at\nthe simplicity of the numerous witnesses\u2014lawyers, medical men,\nmembers of Parliament and others\u2014cited in the Zoist, who vouched\nfor his performances. But there are two considerations which give us\npause. In the first place, though it would have been difficult to prove\n1 See especially Zoist II. pp. 393-409, 477-52!) ; the detailed, and, on the whale,\nimpartial account by Dr. Forbes, F.R S., in the Lancet, August 3rd, 1844 ; a letter in\nthe Morning Chronicle, June 28th, 1844, signed No Go ; the Times, June 25th, 1844 ;\nMedical Timet, July 27th, 1844, and subsequent dates ; various articles in the Critic\nfor 1844 and 1845 ; etc.\n\fxxxiv.] Discussion of Trance-Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 55\nthis even at the time, and of course no certain proof is now possible,\nthere are indications that his trance was genuine ; and if genuine, it is\npermissible to suppose, though the knowledge which he displayed had\nclearly been acquired by the exercise of the normal senses, that he\nhimself was innocent of deception in the matter. In the second place,\nat every seance, together with this display of conscious or unconscious\njugglery, there occurred instances of \" travelling clairvoyance \" and\nthought-reading, which, if not genuine, involved deception of a more\nhazardous and complicated nature. Of course, fraud is the first\nexplanation in a case of this kind. Alexis was a professional\u2014he\nreceived five guineas a seance ; there is no strong improbability in the\nassumption that the respectable M. Marcillet was a confederate ; and\nperhaps the most probable, though not necessarily the correct, ex\nplanation of his card-playing performances is that of deliberate fraud.\nBut in the following instances, which are selected from numerous\nother accounts in the literature of that time as having apparently\nbeen reported with due care, the fraud must have been of a different\nkind. The first account is compiled from notes made by Lord Adare\nof a sitting with Alexis which took place on July 2nd, 1844, at\nthe house of M. Dupuis, in Welbeck-street. A corresponding, but\nrather fuller and more dramatic account of the incident is given\nby the Rev. G. Sandby, in a letter to the Medical Times, dated\nJuly 8th.\nCol. Llewellyn, who was, I believe, rather sceptical, produced a\nmorocco case, something like a surgical instrument case. Alexis took it,\nplaced it to his stomach and said, \"The object is a hard substance, not\nwhite, enclosed in something more white than itself ; it is a bone taken from\na greater body ; a human bone\u2014yours. It has been separated, and cut so\nas to leave a flat side.\" Alexis opened the case, took out a piece of bone\nwrapped in silver paper, and said \" The ball struck here ; it was an extra\nordinary ball in effect ; you received three separate injuries at the same\nmoment ; the bone was broken in three pieces ; you were wounded early in\nthe day whilst engaged in charging the enemy.\" He also described the dress\nof the soldiers, and was right in all these particulars. This excited the\nastonishment of all the bystanders, especially the gallant colonel. This\naccount is drawn up, not only from my own notes, but from Colonel\nLlewellyn's statement made after the seance, and from a written account\ngiven me by a lady who was sitting close by.\u2014(ZoUt II., pp. 510-11.)\nOn the hypothesis that the information given was normally\nobtained, we must suppose that Colonel Llewellyn was a garrulous\nold gentleman, who had betrayed his secret to someone in the room at\nthe time ; or that Marcillet or Alexis had by some means acquired\nbeforehand knowledge of his history, and of his intention to attend the\nseance. Neither supposition can, of course, be dismissed as altogether\nimprobable.\n\f50 [part\nFrank Podmore.\nThe next case is taken from a letter by Dr. W. B. Costello, which\nappeared in the Medical Times of July 27th, 1844. Dr. Costello ex\nplains that, though personally unknown to Marcillet, he had obtained an\nintroduction to him (apparently through a friend), and had accordingly\npresented himself with Marcillet's card at a seance held in a private\nhouse. It may be presumed, therefore, that Marcillet was aware of\nDr. Costello's intention to be present, and had had the opportunity of\nworking up his dossier. After relating two \" clairvoyant \" descrip\ntions of distant scenes and houses given to other guests, which were\napparently recognised as substantially correct, Dr. Costello proceeds :\u2014\nThe sitting was now drawing to a close, and ... I asked permission\nto put a question as to a fact in which I was engaged early on Monday\nmorning. I said I was aware that coming there under the auspices of the\nmesmcriser, and, moreover, labouring under the disadvantage of not being\nknown to himself, I could well understand that if the answer was satis\nfactory it could be only to myself, but if it were otherwise I should state\nit to be so without hesitation. Permission having been courteously granted,\nI took Alexis by the hand and asked him to describe the persons, the\nroom, and the act in which I was engaged on Monday morning. He\nanswered, after brief musing, \" You are in a room with a person, not on a\nbed, but a couchette ; this person has suffered a great deal ; you have been\ndoing something to his head\u2014there is another person also\u2014there are\ninstruments with screws laid out on the table (des objets m\u00e9caniques et a\nvis).\" While speaking he kept moving his hands over the front of his\nperson, till he reached the lower part of the abdomen, when he exclaimed\nsuddenly, \"Tiens, vous l'operez aussi au bas ventre, vous operez pour la\npierre.\" I was astonished at the minuteness and truthfulness of his\ndescription. I asked him if the patient was old or young. He answered\nyoung. The truth was I was performing the operation of lithotrity on a\ngentleman, not young, but eighty years of age, at Clifton, on the morning\nof that day, and the room, sofa and position of the table on which my instru\nments lay were as correctly described as if he had been present. It is, more\nover, not a little singular that the patient has an ulceration behind the ear,\nwhich his servant dresses for him. This closed the sitting. Of course the\ncorrectness of Alexis' answers to me had no influence on the mind of Air.\n. It might, however have puzzled him, as it has me, had I been known\nto him, as I trust I am to the rest of the members of my own profession.\nThe next account is extracted from a long letter, dated Mon Loisir,\nLausanne, November 25th, 1851, written by the Rev. Chauncey Hare\nTownshend to Dr. Elliotson, and containing a minute description of a\nseance with Alexis, at which Marcillet was not present. Townshend\nrelates that he had paid a surprise visit to Marcillet in passing through\nParis the previous month ; he had introduced himself as a friend of\nElliotson, and found that both his name and the fact that he had\nwritten a book on mesmerism were unknown to Marcillet. The latter,\nat Townshend's earnest request, had sent a messenger for Alexis, and\n\fxxxiv.] Discussion of Trance-Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 57\nbrought him round to Townshend's hotel some hours later. As soon as\nAlexis was in the \" mesmeric \" trance Marcillet left the room, and\nI began to test the clairvoyance of Alexis, in the matter of seeing distant\nplaces. I asked him if he would visit my house (in thought). He im\nmediately asked, \" Which, for you have two ? You have a house in London\nand one in the country. Which shall I go to first ? \"\n1 said, \" To the house in the country.\"\nAfter a pause, Alexis said, \"J'ysuis!\" and then, to my surprise, he\nopened wide both his eyes, and stared about him. I saw, however, at once,\nthat he had the fixed rigid gaze of a sleep waker. As far as I could\nperceive, he never once altered the fixed position of the lids during the\nwhole time that he was in distant clairvoyance. The pupil looked dilated\ndull, and without any movement of conscious activity.\n\" Well,\" I asked, \" what do you see 1 \"\n\" Je vots,\" said he, \" une maison d'un moyen apparence. Cest une maison,\npas un chateau. II y a un jardin autour. A cote\" gauche il y a une maison,\nplus petite, sur la proprieU.',\nAll this was said in breaths, with some effort, and with a hurried gasp,\nas it were, between each sentence. I own I was surprised at the accuracy\nof the description of my house near Lausanne, particularly at the mention\nof the small house on the left-hand side, where, according to Swiss custom,\ndwells my landlady. It was, in fact, a marking feature of the place, not to\nbe guessed at by a stranger, and, as such, brought much conviction to my\nmind. \"Now,\" said I to Alexis, \"What sort of view do you see?\"\n\" De I'eait, de Veau,\" said he hurriedly, as if he saw the lake which indeed\nspreads out before my windows. Then \" II y a des arbres en face tons pris\nde la maison\" (all true). \"Well now,\" I said, \"we will go into the\ndrawing-room\" (salon). \" What do you see ? \" He looked about, and said\n(where my memory fails as to the exact words I give the sense in English),\n\" You have a good many pictures on the walls. But now, this is curious\u2014\nthey are all modern, except two.\"\n\"And these two,\" said I ; \" can you see the subjects ? \"\n\" Oh, yes ! One is a sea-piece ; the other is un snjet religieux.\"\nI really felt something of a shudder at this extreme precision. How\nthen was I astonished when Alexis went on to describe minutely the snjet\nreligieux, which was a picture I had lately bought of an Italian refugee, and\nwhich had many striking peculiarities. He said at once, \" There are three\nfigures in the picture\u2014an old man, a woman, and a child. Can the woman\nbe the Virgin ? (he asked of himself musingly) No ! she is too old (pro\nceeded he, answering his own question, while I remained perfectly silent).\nThe woman has a book upon her lap, and the child points with its finger to\nsomething in the book ! There is a distaff in the corner.\" Effectively, the\npicture represented St. Ann teaching the Virgin to read, and every\nparticular respecting it was correct.\nI asked, \"On what is the picture painted ? \"\nAlexis answered, \" It is neither on canvas nor copper (metal). It is on a\ncurious substance.\" After some consideration he began to rap on the table\nwith his knuckles, as if trying to ascertain the nature of the substance.\nThen he called out \"Cest sur pierre.\" (The picture is in fact on black\n\f58 [part\nFrank Podmore.\nmarble.) \" Now,\" said he, \"I am looking at it behind. It is of a curious\ncolour entre noirdtre et gris (the exact colour it is behind). It is also rmigh\nbehind. El tiens,\" added he, \" c'est bombe.\"\nThis last peculiarity would have convinced the most incredulous. The\npicture, from a warp or curve in the stone, had been very difficult to frame.\n(Zoist IX., pp. 405-6.)\nAlexis then proceeded to give an equally detailed description of\nTownshend's house in Norfolk Street, London ; of the maid-servants\nthere, the horse in the stables, etc. ; and furnished various other proofs\nof clairvoyance.\nThe obvious remark on a case of this kind is that Townshend was\na well-known writer on mesmerism ; that it was practically certain\nthat he would at some time or another come to see Alexis ; and that\nit would probably be worth while for Alexis and his agents to \"get\nup \" as many facts as possible in connection with him, in order to afford\na convincing proof of supernormal faculty. That the description of\nthe maidservants in the house in London, and the grey horse in the\nstable with sores on its flanks, applied accurately to the time of the\nseance would only prove, on this hypothesis, that Alexis' Intelligence\nDepartment was up-to-date. It is true that this explanation becomes\nmore and more difficult as it has to be applied to a wider and wider\ncircle. But though successful clairvoyant descriptions of the kind\nappear to have been given at every seance, the reports which we\npossess are mostly at secondhand, or insufficiently detailed, and the\nnames of persons concerned are frequently not given. As a \" sitting \"\nwith Alexis appears to have been a kind of levee attended by some\nthirty or forty persons, it is clear that Alexis had considerable chances\nof utilising any information which he might have surreptitiously\nacquired ; and the supposition that his display of apparent clairvoyance\nwas, in fact, to be so explained, though it certainly implies the\npossession of highly-trained confederates and singular good fortune in\nthe chance of sitters, is not perhaps to be summarily dismissed. It\nis interesting to remark that Alexis himself expressly disclaimed any\nassistance from spirits in the matter.\nThe revelations of the two clairvoyants so far considered bear little\nresemblance to those of Mrs. Piper. Our next seer is of a different\ntype, and presents, so far as I am aware, as close a parallel as any in\nlater spiritualistic literature to the American clairvoyant*.\nAlphonse Cahagnet describes himself as a simple ouvrier. He\nwas, in fact, as we learn from an authoritative account of him in the\nJournal du MagnUisme,1 originally a journeyman cabinet-maker, and\nsubsequently took up the trade of restoring old furniture. In January,\n1848, he published at Paris the first volume of his Arcanes de la vie\ni Vol. XIII., p. 3+0.\n\fxxxiv.] Discussion of Trance-Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 59\nfuture devoih's, in which he gave an account of communications received\nthrough eight somnambules, which purported to proceed from thirty-\nsix persons of various stations, who had died at different epochs, some\nof them more than two centuries previously. The seances had extended\nover some years. This first volume contained \" revelations \" of the\nusual post-Swedenborgian kind about the constitution of the spirit\nspheres, the occupations of the deceased, the bliss of the after life, and\nso on, together with more personal messages from deceased friends of\nthose persons whom Cahagnet admitted to witness the manifestations.\nBut there is little or nothing to show that the so-called communications\ndid not emanate exclusively from the imagination of the medium, and\nwe are dependent solely upon Cahagnet's good faith and competence\nfor the accuracy of the reports given. Cahagnet appears, however,\nto have been a man of quite unusual sincerity and teachableness.\nThe criticisms on his earlier work showed him where the evidence\nwas defective ; and in the later seances described in his second\nvolume, which was published in January, 1849, he appears to\nhave done his utmost to establish the authenticity of the alleged\nspirit communications by procuring, wherever possible, the written\nattestations of the other persons present. The medium in all these\nlater sittings was a young woman named Adele Maginot, whom he had\nknown for many years. A natural somnambulist from her childhood,\nshe had allowed Cahagnet to \" magnetise \" her, in order that he\nmight put a Stop to the spontaneous attacks which were impairing her\nhealth. He soon found her an excellent clairvoyante, especially for\nthe diagnosis and cure of diseases.\nIn the later seances, however, which took place in the spring and\nsummer of 1848, Adele was chiefly consulted by persons who wished\nfor interviews with deceased friends. Cahagnet drew up a statement\nof the communications made at each of these sittings, and asked the\nsitters to sign the statement, indicating how far the particulars given\nwere true or false. These statements, with the signed attestations, are\npublished. In the few cases where the names are not given in full,\nCahagnet explains that for sufficient reasons the sitters had desired\nthat their names should be withheld from the general public, but that\nthey were at the disposal of any private inquirer who might wish\nto satisfy himself of the genuineness of the accounts. Of course these\nreports, which do not profess to be verbatim, do not show what indica\ntions the clairvoyante may have received from leading questions or\nundesigned hints by the sitters.\nCahagnet, indeed, seems to admit a certain amount of editing on\nhis part. His words are :\u2014\n\"Cet ouvrage est loin d'offrir l'int\u00e9ret du roman par son style forc\u00e9ment\ncoup\u00e9, accident\u00e9. Aussi conviendrait-il mieux aux amateurs de la science\n\f60 [part\nFrank Podmore.\nqu'aux lecteurs passionnes des descriptions po&iques de nos romans du jour.\nJ'ai chercM a reiidre le style le plus clair possible en le depouUlant de eel\nentourage de questions, de scenes e'tranqires a ce genre de revelations.

Je suis rested dans les\nlimites de l'austere verit\u00e9, du role impartial de 1'historien, presentant a la\nphilosophic du jour, des faits dans toute leur nudity, mais aussi dans toute\nleur sincerit\u00e9.\" (Vol. II., p. 233).\nBut it is evident from the accounts given that many of the sitters,\nat any rate, were sceptical, and on their guard against deception.\nAnd in some cases it is clear that no hints received from the sitters\ncould have furnished information, as in the case of Rostan, quoted\nbelow. Another possible evidential defect is that, though Cahagnet\ntells us that he has recorded all the somnambule's mistakes as well as\nall her correct statements (Vol. II. p. 126), he does not expressly say\nthat he has published the records of every seance. As, however, we\nhave numbered records of forty-six seances in the interval between\ngoing to press with the first volume in the autumn of 1847, and the\nend of August, 1848, twenty-eight of which sittings took place between\nthe 6th of March and the latter date, it may, I think, fairly be\nassumed that the sittings here recorded represent at least a substantial\nproportion of those which actually took place. Lastly, to complete the\nenumeration of the more prominent evidential defects, very few dates\nare given. In this respect also, however, the second volume shows a\nmarked improvement over the first. The ninety-six seances there\nrecorded contain hardly a single date. But of the later seances several\nare dated, and the rest, from internal evidence, appear to be printed in\nchronological order. I can pay M. Cahagnet no higher compliment\nthan to say that, taken all together, he seems more nearly to approach\nthe evidential standard which the investigators of the S.P.R., after\nlong years of work, have elaborated for their own guidance, than any\nprevious worker in these obscure regions.\nThe following are a few representative records :\u2014\nNo. 129.1\u2014M. Petiet asks for M. Jerome Petiet. Adele sees a young\nman, about twenty-four or twenty-six years of age (he was thirty), not so tall\nas his brother now present ; auburn hair, rather long ; open forehead, arched\nand very pronounced eyebrows, brown and rather sunken eyes, nose rather\nlong, pretty well formed ; complexion fresh, skin very white and delicate,\nmedium sized mouth, round dimpled chin. \" He was weak in the chest ; he\nwould have been very strong had it not been for this. He wears a rough\ngrey vest, buttons with a shank and eye such as are no longer worn. I do\nnot think they are brass ones, nor of the same stulT as the vest. They don't\nlook to me very bright. His pantaloons are of a dark colour, and he wears\nlow quartered shoes without any instep.\n1 Vol. II., pp. 170-2. The sittings are numbered in one series through the two\nvolumes : Vol. II. begins with Seance No. 98.\n\fxxxiv.] Discussion of Trance-Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 61\n\"This man was of a stubborn disposition, selfish,without any fine feelings,\nhad a sinister look, was not very communicative, devoid of candour, and had\nbut little affection for anyone. He had suffered with his heart. His death\nwas natural, but sudden. He died of suffocation.\" Adele chokes as this man\nchoked, and coughed as he did. She says that \" he must have had moxas or\na plaster applied to his back, and this accounts for the sore I see there. He\nhad no disease, however, in that part. The spine was sound. Those who\napplied this remedy did not know the seat of the disease. He holds himself\nbadly. His back is round without being humped.\"\nM. Petiet finds nothing to alter in these details, which are very exact, and\ncoufirni him in his belief that the application of this plaster, advised by a\nman who was not a doctor, brought on his brother's death, which was almost\nsudden .\n\" Signed the present report as very exact.\nPetiet,\n19, Rue Neuve-Coquenard.\"\nNote.\u2014The buttons that Adele was unable to describe were of metal, a\ndirty white ground, and surrounded by a blue circle. In this apparition there\nis a remarkable fact to be noted\u2014viz., that Adele experienced the same\nkind of illness as this man. I was obliged to release her by passes, she\nsuffered terribly.\nIn the sitting next to be quoted, M. du Potet, a well-known writer\non Animal Magnetism, and editor at that time of the Journal du\nMagniligme in Paris, had brought with him the Prince de Kourakine,\nwho is described as being \"Secretary to the Russian Ambassador.\"\nThe Prince had asked for his sister-in-law, and a striking personal\ndescription had been given by Adele, which was acknowledged by\nthe Prince, in the hearing of M. du Potet and two other witnesses,\nto be accurate. Unfortunately, the Prince's signed attestation was\nnot procured on the spot ; he had promised to come again, but\u2014as\nCahagnet delicately puts it\u2014\" les eVenements survenus en France\nl'ont force1 de partir,\" and the promised testimony was never obtained.\nAfter the apparition of the Russian Princess, however, the record\ncontinues :\u2014\nNo. 117*.\u2014M. du Potet wishes in his turn to call up M. Dubois, a doctor,\na friend of his who had been dead about fifteen months.\nAdele said : \" I see a grey-headed man, he has very little hair on the\nfront of his head ; his forehead is bare and prominent at the temples, making\nhis head appear square. He may be about sixty years of age. He has two\nwrinkles on either side of his cheeks, a crease under his chin, making it look\ndouble ; he is short-necked and stumpy ; has small eyes, a thick nose, a\nrather large mouth, a flat chin, and small thin hands. He does not look to\nme quite so tall as M. du Potet ; if he is not stouter he is more broad-\nshouldered. He wears a brown frock-coat with side pockets.

He has a very funny\nwalk, he does not carry himself well, and has weak legs ; he must hare\nsuffered from them. He has rather short trousers. Ah ! he does not clean\nhis shoes every day, for they are covered with mud. Taking it altogether,\nhe is not well dressed. He has asthma, for he breathes with difficulty. I\nsee, too, that he has a swelling in the abdomen, he has something to support\nit. I have told him that it is M. du Potet who asked for him. He talks to\nme of magnetism with incredible volubility ; he talks of everything at once ;\nhe mixes everything up ; I cannot understand any of it ; it makes him\nsputter saliva.\"\nM. du Potet asks that the apparition may be asked why he has not\nappeared to him before as he had promised? He answers: \"Wait till I\nfind out my whereabouts ; I have only just arrived, I am studying everything\nI see. I want to tell you all about it when I appear, and I shall have many\nthiiigs to tell you.\"\n\" Which duy did you promise me you would do so ?\" \" On a Wednes\nday.\" Adele adds : \" This man must be forgetful ; I am sure that he was\nvery absent-minded.\" M. du Potet asks further : \"When will you appear\nto me?\" \"I cannot fix the time, I shall try to do so in six weeks.\"\n\" Ask him if he was fond of the Jesuits ? \" At this name he gives such a\nleap in the air, stretching out his arms and crying \"The Jesuits,\" that\nAdele draws back quickly, and is so startled that she does not venture to\nspeak to him again.\nM. du Potet declares that all these details are very accurate, that he\ncannot alter a syllable. He says that this man's powers of conversation\nwere inexhaustible ; he mixed up all the sciences to which he was devoted,\nand spoke with such volubility that, as the clairvoyante says, he sputtered in\nconsequence. He took little pains with his appearance ; he was so absent-\nminded that he sometimes forgot to eat. When anyone mentioned the\nJesuits to him he jumped as Adele has described. He was always covered\nwith mud like a spaniel. It is not surprising that the clairvoyante should\nseo him with muddy shoes. He had, in fact, promised M. du Potet that he\nwonld appear to him on a Wednesday or a Saturday. M. du Potet has\nacknowledged the accuracy of this apparition in No. 75 of the Journal du\nMagnitisme.\nIn effect, in the Journal of August 10th of the same year, in\nreviewing the first volume, Du Potet gives handsome testimony to the\nstriicing nature of the impersonation, \" si bien que je croyais le voir\nmoi-meme, tant le tableau en \u00e9tait saisissant. Bient6t cette ombre\ns'est enfuie en effrayant la somnambule ; un seul mot avait cause cette\ndisparitiou subite, et mon etonnement en fut porte1 a son comble, car\nce meme mot le mettait toujours en fureur.\" But Du Potet, for all\nthat, is inclined to attribute the phenomenon to transmission of\nthought from his own mind ; 1 and a few months later,* in review\ning the second volume, he takes occasion to give the result of his\n1 Journal du MagnUiamc, Vol. VII., p. 89.\ns Journal du Magntliime, Vol. VIII., p. 24.\n\fxxxiv.] Discussion of Trance-Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 63\nfurther inquiries on this seance. Generally, the minute description of\nthe personal appearance and other particulars which were prominent\nin Du Potet's own mind at the time were correct ; and other details\nwere correctly given which Du Potet might have heard, but had\ncertainly not remembered at the time. He had ascertained, however,\nfrom the widow and children, that Dr. Dubois took no tobacco ;\nnever had a redingote of the colour described ; had no hernia, and\nconsequently wore no bandage. Moreover, the apparition predicted\nnever came off. Du Potet, however, adds expressly that Dr. Dubois\nwas unknown in life to Cahagnet and his somnambule.\nThe explanation by telepathy becomes a little more difficult in\nthe seance next quoted. The sitter in this case, Dejean de la Bastie,\nDelegate to the Government from the Isle of Bourbon, had come a\nfew days previously, and received a personal description of his father,\nwhich he acknowledged to be exact with a few trifling exceptions,\ntogether with much excellent paternal advice.\nNo. 141.1\u2014M. Dejean de la Bastie, already quoted in Seance 138, desires\nanother apparition. He asks for M. Marie-Joseph-Theodore de Guign6.\nAdele sees a man about forty years of age, rather tall, with brown hair. M.\nDejean interrupts Adele by saying that this is not the portrait of the person\nfor whom he asks. We see that this gentleman wishes for perfectly accurate\ninformation. At the words \" rather tall, with brown hair,\" he says, \"He\nwas tall and not brown-haired.\" AdMe answers that the person whose\nappearance sho is describing must have the same name and belong to his\nfamily, that she is conscious that it is so ; but he again asks for this gentle\nman, and a second person appears. The first remains. \" The newcomer,\"\nshe says, \" is thirty years of age and over ; he is tall and thin, has dark-\nflaxen hair, a pale face, with rather sweet, dark-blue eyes ; a long nose, a\nmouth that is large rather than small, a long chin. I see he wears a sort\nof great coat, such as is no longer worn. It is not at all becoming ; it\nresembles a dressing-gown, but is not one ; it is dark-blue or black.\nThis garb proclaims him to be a man in orders\u2014a priest or something\nof the kind. He looks stern. He must have had chest complaint. I see\nthat his lungs are distended with blood. He has been ailing a long\ntime. He is very weak. I think that privations have caused this, and\nmade his chest so delicate. I do not see, however, that he has the\ngerms of any fatal disease, and this makes me believe that his death was\nviolent, accidental, unexpected. His hand is large and thin. I see a\nmedal on his breast, the size of the palm of a hand. He wears low-cut\nshoes, such as are not worn now. He will not speak to me, so I conclude\nthat he did not speak French.\"\nThe following remarks precede the signature of M. Dejean: \u2014\"This\nperson had more of gentleness and kindness than severity in his disposition.\nHe died of a malignant fever, accompanied by delirium lasting several days,\ni Vol II., pp. 219-220.\n\fFrank Podmore.

M. 1'Abbe\nA , mentioned at the beginning of the record, had had a successful\nexperiment of the same kind at a previous sitting (No. 112).\nNo. 1221.\u2014Pastor Rostan, who is referred to in the preceding s\u00e9ance in\nconnection with the conversion of M. l'Abbe A , desired in his turn to\nobtain an apparition. He asked for a person unknown to him, whose name\nhad been given to him ; but there had been a mistake made in giving hi:n\nthis name ; in consequence a person appeared whose description we took,\nbut who could not be recognised. At least, such is this gentleman's version,\nand I do not imagine that I was imposed upon. I suggested a second seance\nto him, especially as he persisted in asking for a person entirely unknown to\nhim, to such an extent had he been influenced by M. Hebert's arguments.\nHe then asked his maid-servant to give him a name of one of her acquaint\nances who had been dead some time ; he came armed with this name, and\nasked for Jeannette Jex. Adele replied : \"I see a woman who is not tall,\nshe may be between thirty and forty years of age ; if she is not hump-backed\nshe must be crook-backed, for she carries herself very badly. I cannot make\nher turn round. Her hair is auburn, approaching to red ; she has small\ngrey eyes, a thick nose. She is not good-looking. She has a prominent\nchin, a receding mouth, thin lips ; her dress is countrified. I see that she\nhas a cap with two fiat bands, rounded over the ears. She must have\nsuffered from a flow of blood to the head, she has had indigestion. I see\nshe has a swelling in the abdomen on the left side and in the glands of one\nbreast. She has been ill a long time.\"\nM. Rostan handed over the report to his servant, and gave it back to me\nafter adding his signature and the following remarks :\u2014\n\" This is correct as regards stature, age, dress, carriage, the disease and\ndeformed figure.\n(Signed) J. J. Rostan.\"\nBut if M. Rostan was staggered by the result of his test, his\nfriends apparently still ascribed the results to thought-transference,\nwhich gives Cahagnet occasion for some argument on the subject.\nThere are, indeed, if a digression from the main argument may be\npermitted, indications that some at least of the alleged apparitions\nwere subjective\u2014inspired, that is, by the imagination of the medium,\nsupplemented occasionally by telepathic drafts from the sitter. We\n1 Vol. II., pp. 142-144.\n\fxxxiv.] Discussion of Trance-Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 65\nshould probably bejustified in assuming \u2014in default of any corroborative\nevidence as to their reality\u2014that the accounts of Heaven and of the\noccupations of the spirits therein, given in the first volume, had no more\nremote origin than the medium's own mind, whose workings were no\ndoubt directed, now by memories of lessons learnt in childhood, now by\nhints of the Swedenborgian philosophy received from Cahagnet\nhimself.\nHere, for instance, is an account of a heavenly vision vouchsafed to\nBruno, Cahagnet's first ecstatic, a young man of 27, of mild dis\nposition, and apparently limited education.\nNo. 10.i\u2014Bruno is in a deep ecstasy ; he enters heaven for the first time,\nand there see3 his father, who is seated at a small table reading. \" What\nis the book which your father is holding ? \" \"It is like oura, but the print\ning is not the same.\" \" What is it like ? \" \" It has letters in the shape of\na D, then others shaped like little hooks and crescents. I can hardly de\nscribe it to you. My father closes the book and says that we can understand\nnothing in this writing. Allow me to return to heaven for a moment.\" After\na quarter of an hour he awakes, looks at his bed with contempt, and exclaims :\n',Oh ! I understand why the dead do not regret the earth. Who would\nwish to vegetate on this mud-heap after seeing what I have just seen ?\"\n\u2022'What have you seen, then?\" \"Heaven.\" \"Yes, well, what is heaven\nlike I \" \" Oh ! I was in a place without any horizon, illuminated by a\nsuperb light. Before me was a being who, I believe, was God, seated on a\nthrone ; his head was covered with a shining turban, his beard was grey.\nI think his arm was resting on the arm of his chair. He was robed in\ncrimson velvet studded with golden fleurs-de-lis. His mien was majestic ;\nhe was speaking to his ministers, six or eight in number. I did not count\nthem. They were all seated on the steps of the throne, and were clothed in\nrobes of the same material and the same colour as the robe of God ; but I do\nnot think there was any gold embroidery on them. All round them and in\nthe distance walked a multitude of beings. Oh ! how ugly are the men of\nthe earth in comparison with those beautiful faces, those fair skins ! A\ngauze-like scarf covered one shoulder, and, besides that, they had a little\nskirt of such transparent gauze that every limb was easily distinguishable.\nTheir feet were shod with sandals, fastened with broad laces (eothnrnes) ;\nbut, oh, God ! how beautiful it was ! I was lifted up into the air, I beheld\nthe earth under my feet, and all these little men, so proud, so vain-glorious,\nhow ill-favoured and poor they seemed to me by the side of those divine\nbeings around me.\nAt a later sitting, it should be observed, it was revealed to Bruno\nthat the figure seated on the throne was the angel Gabriel.\nAnd here are some extracts from Adele's visions of Heaven.\nLouise, her spirit niece, comes to the entranced Adele to announce the\nappearance of her second brother [her first had appeared at a previous\nsitting.]\n1 Vol. I., pp. 18-19.\nF\n\f6C [part\nFrank Podmore.\nNo. 40.1\u2014\"Which brother is this?\" \"It is Jean-Marie ; he, too, died\nin Africa three years ago.\" Adele looks with joy on these three members of\nher family ; the latter is also in a dragoon's uniform ; as in previous seances,\nshe talks to them for a very long time without informing me of the subject\nof their conversation. \"What are your brothers doing up in heaven?\"\n\" They enjoy themselves, they walk about.\" \" Eternity cannot be spent in\naimlessly walking up and down and enjoying oneself?\" \"Oh! they play\nmusic, study sciences ; they are better and more pleasurably occupied\nthan we.\"\nNo. 41.\u2014\" Here they are. \" \"Do they seem pleased to see you?\" \"I\nshould think so, indeed.\" \" Is your niece with them ? \" \"No.\" \"Are they\nglad that they are dead?\" \"Who would not be glad! they are so happy.\nThey tell me I shall see my mother.\"\nAdele waits a moment, then all of a sudden she stretches out her arms,\nseems to embrace her mother ; her heart beats violently, her face expresses\nemotion, she is very joyful and sheds tears. \" Does your mother seem as\nglad to see you as you are to see her ? \" \"Oh ! yes.\" \" What does she do\nup in heaven ? \" \" She is with my father, my brothers, my sister, in short\nwith all the family ; she is very anxious about me, she is very happy ; she\nreads, and takes pleasure in hearing my brothers play.\" \"Then there are\nbooks in heaven?\" \" Yes, certainly, and they are not romances such as\nthose of earth.\" \" What do they tell of?\" \"They tell of the mysteries of\nGod, of science ; but they are not written as on earth, so my mother\ntells me.\"\n******\nNo. 452.\u2014\"Are all your relations along with you?\" \"Four of them\nare.\" \" Do you expect any others ? \" \" I expect my sister who is also dead,\nand whom I have not seen as yet.

On each occasion she found the man alive, and conversed\nwith his spirit.\nM. Lucas, a carrier (messager), of Rambouillet, came to inquire after\nthe fate of his brother-in law, who had disappeared after a quarrel\nsome 12 years previously.\nAdele in the trance found the man at once, said that he was\nalive, and that she saw him in a foreign country, where there\nwere trees like those in America, and that he was busy gathering\nseeds from small shrubs, about 3ft. high.

He told no one of it. He went away\non the sly. Having kissed them all the evening before, he made good his\nescape next day, without another word. Do not be uneasy, madam ; you\nwill see him again ! \" This good woman burst into tears, because she recog\nnised the truth of every detail given her by Adele. She did not find\nanything at fault in the description. The disposition, the education, and\nthe departure of her son were as Adele said ; but a greater semblance of\nprobability is given to the clairvoyante's account by the fact that his rela\ntions had an idea that he had enlisted in Don Pedro's army, and at one time\ntook some steps to ascertain the truth of it. M. Lucas told me of this detail\non a journey which he afterwards made to Paris. No information was, how\never, obtainable. What no less contributed to the astonishment of this\ngood woman, of M. Lucas, and the other people present at this curious\ns\u00e9ance, was to see Adele put up her hand to the left side of her face to keep\noff the fiery rays of the sun in those countries, and appear to be suffocated\nwith heat ; but the most extraordinary part of this scene was that she had\na severe sunstroke which turned the whole of that side of her face, from\nforehead to shoulder, bluish red, whilst the other side remained dead\nwhite. This dark colour did not begin to disappear till twenty-four hours\nlater. At the time the heat of it was so great that one could not hold one's\nhand on it.\nThis simulation, by the subliminal consciousness, of the effects of\nsevere sunburn is no doubt not more incredible than the production in\nhypnosis of mimic stigmata. Such physical effects of the imagination,\n\fxxxiv.] Discussion of Trance-Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 69\nif rare, are well authenticated. But if Cahagnet's last sentence refers\nto the heat of the medium's skin, I am afraid we must admit that the\nimagination of the recorder possibly played as prominent a part in the\nmarvel as that of the patient.\nShortly after this incident, M. Mirande, the head of the printing-\noffice in which the first volume of the Arcanes had been printed, came\nto Cahagnet, and asked for a sitting. He was much impressed with\nwhat he saw and heard, and finally\nNo. 1051.\u2014. . . begged Adele to ask for the apparition of his brother,\nwho, he believed, had died in the Russian campaign. As Adele did not see\nhim in the spirit world, she said that he was not dead, that she saw him on\nearth ; she described him thus : \"I see a fine stout man, with brown hah-,\nblack eyes, bright, beautiful, and with a gentle expression ; a medium-\nsized mouth, with good teeth, a well-shaped nose, fresh-coloured cheeks ; he\nis courteous and lively. He looks to me about thirty years of age, he is\nsomewhat taller than M. Mirande. His uniform is that of a non-commis\nsioned officer (I think), for I only see one epaulette, a blue coat, blue trousers\nwith red braid, a shako with a small peak ; taking him altogether he is a\nfine man.\" \"Ask him in what country he is?\" \"He does not know, or\nwill not tell me. He replies that he has suffered much. He has been made\nprisoner and sent into the interior of Russia, to the country bordering on\nChina, I think ; he says that his brother will see him again.\" \" Why has he\nnot written to him?\" \"He has done so, but the letters have either been\nlost or gone astray.\" \"Why does he no linger write?\" \" He does not\nknow whether his brother is still alive.\" \"Tell him that he is alive, and is\nmaking it his business to discover the place of his retreat.\" \"He answers\nthat he cannot tell me that, but that he is in hopes of surprising his brother\nsome day.\" \" What is he doing over there? \" \"He is very happy, he has\nsome estates of his own which he farms, and employs many people. If he\nhad found the means of getting rid of them by selling them he would have\nreturned to France already, but there purchasers are not to be as easily\nfound as they are with us : he does not know when he will be able to do\nthis.\" \"Ask him to write to his brother.\" \"He has no chance. You\nthink it is easy ; he is far away from the sea, and then he is anxious to\nsurprise his brother by returning to him rich and happy. He is not selfish,\nhe is good-hearted, but he is not free from ambition, and never was. The\none and only dream of his life has been to end his days as a rich man, and\nhe has reached the height of his desires.\" \" Is he married 1 \" \" Yes ; but\nhe has no.children. Next time I will ask him to let me see the country in\nwhich he lives, and also his house and his wife.\" Adele is tired, and wishes\nto be awakened. M. Mirande asks for some further information concerning\nhis brother's uniform. Adele repeats what she has already said, and adds\nthat she thinks she saw some lace, what we call brandebourys, on his breast,\nand also that he had white facings to his coat. M. Mirande acknowledged\nthat all the details of the physique were very accurate, as well as those of the\ndisposition, and his brother's ambition for a fortune, his good-heartedness.\ni Vol. II., pp. 60-63.\n\f70 [pakt\nFrank Podmore.\nliveliness, affection, etc., were all quite true. He does not so clearly\nrecollect the details of his dress ; however he is satisfied that it is sub\nstantially correct. This gentleman's brother had served in the departmental\nguard before the Russian campaign. M. Mirande believes that this was\nthe uniform belonging to it, only he never knew him as non-commissioned\nofficer. He is much surprised that his brother, who must be fifty-six, only\nlooks thirty. Adele reminds him that she sees him at the time of his leaving\nFrance. \"Then he was only about twenty-one,\" replies M. Mirande, \"you\nsee him about thirty years of age ; doubtless the fatigue he has gone\nthrough has aged him very much.\" Adele replies : \"Whilst you only knew\nhim as a soldier at the age of twenty-one, he appears to me as an officer and\nolder. Several years may have gone by between that time and the time at\nwhich I see him, that is quite admissible. If I saw him at the age of twenty-\none, it would be said that I see in your mind. If I, on the contrary, saw\nhim at his present age of fifty-six, his brother would not recognise him,\nwhich M. Mirande understands well enough. He in no wise doubts that it\nis his brother who appeared. He cannot recover from his astonishment.\"\nWe have, unfortunately, no corroboration of the truth of the state\nments made about those two persons. A third volume of the Arcanes\nwere published some years later, which went into a second edition\nin 1860, and it is perhaps fair to assume that, if news had come that\neither of the missing persons was still alive, and had passed through\nthe experiences described by Adele, Cahagnet would not have missed\nthe opportunity of making public such a striking testimony to his\nsubjects' clairvoyance. It follows, then, that in these two seances all\nthat we are entitled to say is that Adele was able to divine with, it\nmay be admitted, singular accuracy, the ideas present in the minds of\nher interlocutors. It was a striking example of telepathy ; but we\nhave no kind of proof that it was anything more, and from internal\nevidence it seems very unlikely that it was anything more. In our\ntotal ignorance of all conditions and limitations, it is perhaps fair to\nsay that the assumption that the spirits of the dead are ready to\nattend at any moment the summons of the living does not in itself\nconstitute an additional obstacle to accepting the accounts of Adele's\nseances in general as evidence of spirit intercourse. But it is quite\nanother matter when we have to deal, as in the two cases now in\nquestion, with the spirits of men still living. How did Adele manage\nto discover the whereabouts of those two persons 1 And, still more,\nhow did she contrive that they should speak with her, and that at\na time when one of them, at least, was wide awake and engaged\nin earning his living by the work of his hands 1 And was Adele's\npower of communicating with the spirits of the living restricted to\npersons who had gone away to distant climes in order to escape from\ntheir relations? If Adele, or any other of Cahagnet's clairvoyantes,\nreally had possessed the power of conversing with the living at a\n\fxxxiv.] Discussion of Trance-Phenomenu of Mrs. Piper. 71\ndistance, I cannot doubt that Cahagnet, in the course of his many\nyears' experiments, would have been able to present us with some\nevidence of such a power that was not purely hypothetical. Nothing\nwould be so easy to prove. The fact that no such evidence is forth\ncoming affords, I submit, a strong presumption that Adele did not\npossess that power, and that the conversations here detailed were purely\nimaginary, the authentic or plausible details which they contained\nbeing filched telepathically from the minds of those present. The\ncurious similarity of the two accounts also points in the same direc\ntion. Both men profess to have written home, but the letters must\nhave miscarried. Neither can write now, because they are far from\nthe sea, in the interior. Both have suffered much ; both have been\nprisoners ; both protest that their relations will see them before they\ndie ; neither, however, is in a hurry to come back ; and neither is\nwilling to discover the name of his present place of abiding.\nTo suppose, as the recorder supposes, that these narratives are\nauthentic revelations obtained from actual conversations with the\nspirits of men living in unnamed, and\u2014as Cahagnet explains at length\n\u2014probably nameless localities in the interior of Mexico or Asiatic\nRussia, is to strain credulity to the breaking-point. But if these two\nnarratives are not what they seem to be, what are we to say of the other\nnarratives in the book, which are cast in the same dramatic form, and\ncontain similar details harmonising with the expectations or memories of\nthe interlocutors? If those are not authentic messages from the distant\nliving, we require some further warrant for the assumption that these\nare authentic messages from the spirits of the dead. Considered in\nconjunction with the almost certainly subjective visions of Heaven and\ndead playmates which characterised the earlier trances, these later\nseances certainly point to an exclusively mundane origin.\nBut, after all, to enquire too curiously whether the information dis\nplayed by Adele reached her hidden consciousness from the minds of\nthe dead or the living, is hardly germane to our present purpose.\nIt is enough, here, to note that all the witnesses cited by Cahagnet\nseem to have been satisfied that nothing less than thought-transference\nwould explain the revelations, and that any candid reader now must\nfind it hard to resist the same conviction.\nTo turn now to the consideration of Mrs. Piper's trance-utterances.\nThe first point to be brought out is that the abundance of the material,\nthe fulness of the records, the watchful supervision exercised over the\nmedium herself for some years past, and the extraordinary and almost\nuniformly high level of success, make these records much more note\nworthy than any previous accounts of the kind. Practically we are\njustified by the fulness and accuracy of the records in leaving altogether\nout of account certain sources of error which vitiate to a considerable\n\f72 [PAKT\nFrank Podmore.\nextent any conclusions which might be based even on the sets of docu\nments which I have already cited, and which render almost worthless\nin themselves the great mass of similar narratives in the literature of\nthe past century. It is tolerably clear that Mrs. Piper's success, at any\nrate, cannot be plausibly attributed to the unconscious reproduction\nof knowledge normally acquired ; nor to the skilful manipulation of\ninformation extracted at the time from the sitters themselves ; nor to\nmisrepresentation and exaggeration as to what was actually said at\nthe sittings ; nor\u2014if we may trust Dr. Hodgson's honesty\u2014to the selec\ntion of the \" good \" sittings and the suppression of the failures.\n\" Fishing\" for information, indeed, as Dr. Leaf pointed out nine years\nago, may reasonably have been supposed to operate to some extent at\nthe sittings then given in this country ; but it is clearly inadequate\nto explain even a small fraction of the later records. Our choice now\nseems clearly defined between deliberate and systematic fraud on the\none hand and supernormal faculty on the other.\nNow as regards fraud, there is, of course, no a priori improbability\ninvolved in such an assumption. The position of the Society in such\ninvestigations has always been that, while no dishonesty is necessarily\nimputed to the medium, every possible precaution should be taken\nagainst dishonesty ; and that no experiment can be regarded as conclu\nsive in which the conditions allowed the honesty or dishonesty of the\nmedium to be a factor in the problem. The mere fact that Mrs. Piper\nhas been paid\u2014at the rate lately of 10 dollars a sitting \u2014 has in no\nway affected the precautions taken. The motive to dishonesty in such\nmatters, as we know from long experience, is not necessarily the\nanticipation of pecuniary reward. The precautions taken in Mrs.\nPiper's case were not increased because Mrs. Piper was paid, and\nshould not have been relaxed if she had given her services for\nnothing. But nevertheless, the fact that Mrs. Piper has received pay\nment at the rate of something like \u00a3200 a year for about five years\npast is of some importance, because fraud of the kind here supposed,\u2014\nthe employment of private inquiry agents, \u2014would have necessarily\ninvolved considerable expenditure.\nIf we turn to the case of the three other mediums cited, we see\nthat the motive for fraud was primd facie stronger in the case of\nAlexis Didier, who received a handsome payment for his performances,\nthan in that of Stainton Moses, whose reward was certainly not of\nthe substantial kind, and whose whole career is difficult to reconcile\nwith the assumption of dishonesty.\nAgain, if we defer for the present the consideration of the internal\nevidence afforded by the trance utterances, the presumption of fraud\nin the case of Alexis Didier, based upon the extremely dubious character\nof his demonstrations of clairvoyance at close quarters is, as has been\n\fxxxiv.] Discussion of Traace-Plieiiomena of Mrs. Piper. 73\nshown, overwhelmingly strong ; whilst the fact that Stainton Moses'\nspirit communications were associated with physical phenomena of a\nkind which are known in other cases to have been fraudulently pro\nduced will afford to some minds a presumption hardly less cogent of\nfraud in the trance utterances also. There is no such presumption in\nthe case of Adele Maginot or of Mrs. Piper.\nThere are, indeed, three preliminary arguments against dishonesty\non Mrs. Piper's part, to which some weight should be allowed.\n(1) Mrs. Piper has produced on nearly all those who have come into\ncontact with her\u2014even those who, (see e.g., Report, p. 524), were\npredisposed to think her an impostor\u2014the impression of transparent\nhonesty. (2) By an almost universal consensus of opinion her trance\nis a genuine one, and the association of a genuine trance condition\nwith preconcerted fraud of the kind here supposed would be unusual,\nif not altogether without precedent. It should, perhaps, be added\nthat, whilst we have no independent evidence of any value as to the\nnature of Stainton Moses' trance, the descriptions given would seem to\nindicate that in the case of Alexis Didier the trance was genuine, and\nthe contortions observed both on entering and leaving the trance state\nseem to have been not unlike those observed in Mrs. Piper. There\nwould appear to be no reason to doubt the genuineness of the somnam\nbulic state in the case of Adele. (3) In all these y ears\u2014now thirteen or\nmore\u2014during which Mrs. Piper has been under the close observation,\nfirst of Professor William James, and afterwards of Dr. Hodgson and\nother competent persons \u2014 though she has been shadowed by detectives,\nthough her personal luggage, as Professor Lodge has told us, has been\nsearched, her correspondence read, her goings-out and comings-in\nclosely watched\u2014during all these years not the smallest circumstance\nhas come to light reflecting in any way upon her honesty. Certainly\nno other medium has been exposed to so stringent an ordeal. How\nmuch weight should be attached to general considerations of this\nkind it is difficult to say, but in view especially of the fact that the\nresearches of Dr. Hodgson himself, and of many less competent\ninquirers, have succeeded in bringing home the charge of dishonesty\nto very many professional mediums, that this medium should have\npassed through the most searching and prolonged inquiries without\neven a rumour of an exposure, or the discovery of any suspicious\ncircumstances, is a fact entitled to some weight.\nLet us now consider how far we can account for these various\ntrance-utterances without having recourse to supposed supernormal\nsources of information. As regards Stainton Moses, the case seems\nto me quite clear. Practically all the particulars which his \" spirits \"\nfurnished were names, dates, and other concrete facts, such as could\nhave been culled from the daily papers, published biographies, and\n\f74 [part\nFrank Podmore.\nconversations with his friends. In fact there could be no difficulty in\naccounting for the whole of these communications, with two exceptions,\non the hypothesis that they merely reproduced facts already present\nin his subconscious memory. The two exceptions\u2014the entry of com\nmunications from the spirits of President Garfield and \" Blanche\nAbercromby,\" at an hour when their deaths could hardly have been\nknown by normal means\u2014seem to preclude this simple explanation,\nand compel us to choose, for these two cases at any rate, between\nsupernormal faculty and deliberate fraud. In the absence of any\ncorroborative evidence we should not be justified in pressing the\nformer explanation.\nThe problem presented by Alexis Didier is more difficult. It is true\nthat the kind of information given\u2014description of scenes, the exterior\nand interior of houses, and occasionally the recent occupations of the\nsitters\u2014is not beyond the competence of a smart inquiry agent ; and\nthe circumstances were no doubt favourable ; there were nearly always\na crowd of persons present at the seances; no doubt he and Marcillet\ncould form a pretty shrewd guess beforehand at some of the sitters ;\nand probably Alexis was free to choose at each seance from amongst\nthe thirty or forty expectant recipients the two or three about whom\nhe had the most to tell. But his frequent and conspicuous success\nmakes this explanation extremely difficult. If fraud is really the\nexplanation of Alexis' clairvoyance at a distance, I think we must\nregard it as the high-water mark of achievement in this line.\nWith Adele Maginot we are carried one step further. We are no\nlonger concerned with names and dates merely ; or merely with descrip\ntions of houses and parks ; nor is the medium any longer free, within\nwide limits, to choose what information she will give, and to whom.\nAdele, as we have seen, had only one or two sitters at a time ; and\nshe had to fulfil the tests which were prescribed to her by them. And\nthe particulars given in response to the requests of her sitters\u2014 minute\ndescriptions of the personal appearance, the ailments, the character,\nand so on of persons often dead many years before \u2014sometimes of\npersons not known even to the sitters themselves\u2014were not such as\nany inquiry agent could have ascertained, one supposes, without grave\nrisk of detection ; even had the sittings been fixed some time before\nhand, and all the other circumstances been favourable to the under\ntaking of such inquiries. On the whole, notwithstanding the various\ndefects already enumerated in the record, I find it almost impossible\nto doubt that Adele's success was due to some kind of supernormal\nfaculty.\nBut now turn to Mrs. Piper, and note that the conditions of the\nexperiment are in her case incomparably more stringent than in any\nprevious clairvoyante. She could not pour out information at her own\n\fxxxiv.] Discussion of Trance-Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 75\nfancy ; she could not, even within the narrowest limits, select her\nsitters; and,\u2014if we admit that the precautions taken were effectual to\nthat end,\u2014she did not even know their names. Practically, of course,\nthe proof of her supernormal powers very largely depends upon the\neffectiveness of those precautions to secure the anonymity of the sitters\nin the first sittings,\u2014and I do not propose here to consider any others.\nWhat those precautions were are described in general terms in the\nReport. The arrangements for sittings were made by letter or verbally\nwith Dr. Hodgson ; the correspondence and diary of engagements were\nkept in a locked desk at Dr. Hodgson's office. The sittings were fixed\nsometimes a fortnight, sometimes only two or three days beforehand ;\nthe dates were sometimes changed ; in one case for instance (p. 527,\nDr. F. H. K., Illinois) the sitting was fixed at two or three days' notice\nonly, the sitter coming from a distant State, and being a stranger even\nto Dr. Hodgson. Moreover, one series of sittings were held in\nCambridge (U.S.A.), under the direction of Professor James ; another\nin New York, under Dr. Thaw ; and similar precautions against\nrevealing the sitters' names were taken in this country ; at Liverpool\nby Professor Lodge, at Cambridge (England) by Mr. Myers, in London\nby Dr. Leaf. That in one or other of these instances the precautions\ntaken may have been insufficient ; that letters may have been left\nlying about ; desks left open ; false keys found serviceable ;\u2014that by\nsome carelessness or malign chance there may have been a loophole for\nfraud, is, of course, conceivable. But it would be very difficult to\nsuppose that that loophole was always left open, that that malign\nchance favored Mrs. Piper for nine years so punctually that the\nsittings which have to be written down as failures now number barely\n10 per cent. The case in that respect could easily be made very much\nstronger ; in England, for instance, there were several successful sitters\nwho came as chance callers and were introduced without any previous\nnotice at all. And it is at least worth remarking that the one series\nof sittings where it would have been least difficult to anticipate the\nnames of the probable sitters and to provide for their advent \u2014the\nwell-known Professors of Harvard, who came when Mrs. Piper was\nunder Professor James' direction,\u2014was one of the least successful here\nrecorded.\nBut let us dismiss the initial difficulty and assume that Mrs.\nPiper, by skill of her own, by fatuity of the investigators, or by some\nincredible chance, had kept herself through all these years posted up\nin the names of the sitters and the dates of their coming. She would\nthen be in the same position as Adele Maginot. But if we find it\ndifficult to believe that the information given by Adele could have\nbeen acquired by normal means, what shall we say of the much more\ndetailed and intimate revelations of Mrs. Piper ? There are two ways\n\f76 [part\nFrank Podmore.\nin which details of the kind given might conceivably have been\nobtained ; either from other mediums, or, directly, by means of\ninquiries made for the express purpose. Now it is no doubt permis\nsible to assume a freemasonry amongst professional mediums leading\nto a continual interchange of useful information about persons who\nare in the habit of resorting to clairvoyants. There is evidence that\nsome such system does exist. And it is the case that several of the\nsitters mentioned in Dr. Hodgson's Report had previously paid visits to\nother professional mediums. But, so far as we can judge, that applies\nonly to a small portion of the sitters ; and in any case this would not\nbe a complete explanation of the matter. Mrs. Piper's unquestioned\nsuperiority to all other professional mediums is in itself sufficient proof\nthat she is not dependent solely on common sources of information.\nWe are driven, then, ultimately to the supposition that Mrs. Piper has\nin her employment one or more inquiry agents or private detectives.\nSuppose, then, Mrs. Piper's agent, armed with the name and\naddress in some distant State, to go on the quest of information about\nan intending sitter. He would find no difficulty in ascertaining such\nbare external facts as the locality of the house, nature of business,\nsocial standing, etc. The local papers, the public registers, the family\nlot in the cemetery, the gossip of the local tradesmen would furnish\nhim with additional particulars. In the role of book-canvasser, say,\nhe would obtain entrance to the house, and would thus be competent\nto furnish accurate descriptions of the living rooms and the servants'\nquarters. By chatting with a sympathetic nursemaid he could learn\nmore personal details\u2014names, age, appearance, disposition, etc., of\nchildren, near relatives or intimate friends of the household, and\nrecent accidents, illness or death amongst them. By the more\nhazardous process of bribing servants to read letters and open desks,\nand so on, he could in some cases no doubt obtain more intimate\ndetails of family troubles, distant friends, relatives dead years ago.\nBut it is clear that the further he pushed his inquiries by such\nmethods\u2014even did time permit\u2014the greater the risk (which on the\naverage of so many cases would amount to a certainty) of ultimate\ndetection. Moreover, such proceedings would be costly and the results\nvery uncertain.\nTo turn now to the contents of the messages The first salient\npoint is that Mrs. Piper is weak precisely where Stainton Moses was\nstrong\u2014in names and dates. Dates appear to be given very rarely.\nNames, of course, appear frequently ; but the Christian names are given\nas a rule first ; and both Christian and surnames emerge frequently\npiecemeal, and obviously with considerable effort. This tentative\nexhibition of important information was naturally regarded at the\nearlier sittings as a suspicious circumstance, pointing to \" fishing \" ;\n\fxxxiv.] Discussion of Trance-Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 77\nand indeed I imagine that Phinuit's evil reputation rests mainly on\nthis characteristic. But in so far as it is founded on this circumstance,\nthat reputation is apparently undeserved. For this same tentative\nand piecemeal emergence of proper names appears In the most fully\nreported sittings, where it is tolerably certain that no hints were given,\nand even in those sittings where the communication is made entirely\nby writing. So that now it may fairly be urged that the sparing use\nof dates and the difficulty in eliciting proper names are arguments so\nfar as they go against fraud \u2014against fraud, that is, of the only kind\nthat can reasonably be supposed to have operated.\nThere are indeed several cases referred to in Dr. Hodgson's previous\nreport (Vol. VIII., pp. 37-42, p. 104, etc.) in which the information\nvolunteered by the trance-intelligence (without any reference, or only\nan indirect reference, to the sitter) was such as might easily have been\ngot from the newspapers, inscriptions on tombstones, etc. Such are\nthe cases of Porter Brewster, William N , Gracie X , and the\nRev. Robert West. Now it is interesting to note that in these cases\nno precise dates are given ; the approximate date furnished in one case\nis four years out ; the names and other details in the first case are\nhopelessly jumbled up and incorrect ; whilst in the second case the\n\" spirit \" can only indicate the place of his death as \" some Western\nCity.\" The obvious comment is that the \" spirit-guides \" of Stainton\nMoses did this sort of thing much better.\nAgain, in marked contrast, not only to Alexis Didier, but to the\ngreat majority of clairvoyantes, Mrs. Piper comparatively seldom gives\ndescriptions of distant localities, houses, rooms and so on ; and her\nsuccess in such delineations, when they have been attempted, seems\nnot to have been conspicuous.\nIt is hardly necessary to point out what Mrs. Piper's trance-\nutterances do include \u2014detailed personal descriptions of deceased\npersons, their diseases and manner of death, their moral and intel\nlectual characteristics ; dramatic and lifelike representations of such\npersons, their mode of address, their attitude towards, and relation\nwith, others still living, references to cherished personal possessions,\nconversations on various intimate and private matters ; revival of\nforgotten family histories ; and so on, and so on.\nAnd in all this enormous mass of information poured out by one\nto whom \u2014on the assumption of fraud \u2014it represents only indifferent\ndetails learned by rote, we find no hint of self-betrayal. The dramatic\nimpersonations are almost uniformly consistent ; the complex relation\nships and varying attitudes are kept distinct ; there are indeed\nirrelevancies and incoherencies ; but they are not such as to suggest\nconfusion between different family histories or the attachment of\ndossiers to the wrong person, or any of the innumerable mistakes of\n\f78 [part\nFrank Podmore.\nomission and commission into which an impostor, one cannot but\nsuppose, must necessarily fall.\nOn the almost inconceivable hypothesis that Mrs. Piper has obtained\nall this information fraudulently, we can but view with amazement her\nartistic restraint in the use of proper names ; her masterly reticence\non dates and descriptions of houses and such concrete matters, which\nform the stock-in-trade of the common clairvoyante ; the consum\nmate skill which has enabled her to portray hundreds of different\ncharacters without ever confusing the r61e, to utilise the stores of\ninformation so laboriously acquired without ever betraying the secret\nof their origin. In a word, if Mrs. Piper's trance-utterances are\nentirely founded on knowledge acquired by normal means, Mrs. Piper\nmust be admitted to have inaugurated a new departure in fraud. '\nNothing to approach this has ever been done before. On the assump\ntion that all so-called clairvoyance is fraudulent, we have seen the\nutmost which fraud has been able to accomplish in the past, and at\nits best it falls immeasurably short of Mrs. Piper's achievements.\nNow, that in itself requires explanation. \"We know somewhat of the\nconditions and the limits of fraud, and if all clairvoyants are simply\ntricksters it has to be explained why Mrs. Piper is so incomparably\nsuperior to all her fellows. For whatever differences there may be\nin the conditions and opportunities, be it noted, are differences which\nmust have operated to the disadvantage of Mrs. Piper. On the\nassumption of fraud the tremendous gulf between her and them is an\nalmost insuperable obstacle. But, on the other hand, if it be conceded\nthat Mrs. Piper has genuine supernormal powers, the concession is no\nbar to recognising similar powers in a greatly inferior degree in other\nreputed clairvoyants. For whilst we know something of fraud, we\nknow nothing at all of the limits and conditions in which such super\nnormal faculties must be supposed to operate.\ni\n\fxxxiv.] Contribution to Study of Hysteria and Hypnosis. 7J)\nIV.\nA CONTRIBUTION TO THE STUDY OF HYSTERIA AND\nHYPNOSIS ; BEING SOME EXPERIMENTS ON TWO\nCASES OF HYSTERIA, AND A PHYSIOLOGICO-\nANATOMICAL THEORY OF THE NATURE OF\nTHESE NEUROSES.\nBy Morton Prince, M.D.\n(Instructor in Nervous Diseases, Harvard Medical School, Physician for\nNervous Diseases, Boston City Hospital.)\n[Preliminary Note.\u2014The following observations were made some\neight or nine years ago, while the paper itself was written seven years\nago, and was presented at that time to the American Neurological\nAssociation at its annual meeting in 1891. It was then laid aside,\nwith the intention on the part of the writer of further carrying on\nthe experiments with the expectation of obtaining more light on the\nmatter, and either substantiating the theory of hysteria propounded\nor controverting it. Other work has prevented this intention from\nbeing carried out, and the existence of the paper was forgotten. It is\nnow published, at the request of Dr. Hodgson, in its original form,\nexcepting that certain parts have been expanded with the view of\nmaking the theory more intelligible to the reader who is not an\nexpert in neurology. This much is due in explanation, as, while\nthe observations themselves have long since lost their novelty, the\nphraseology would imply the contrary, and would seem, perhaps, not\nto take cognisance of the work that has been done of late years in\nthis field.\nDuring the last decade much work has been done, especially in\nFrance, in the field of hysteria, resulting in very extensive contribu\ntions to our knowledge of the subject. The studies of M. Janet\nin particular have given us a new insight into this neurosis, and\nit may be said that as a result of the accumulated facts we have\nbeen obliged to recast our conceptions of the disease. This new work,\nhowever, has been for the most part along psychological lines. The\ntheory here offered is an attempt to find a physiologico-anatomical\nbasis for certain psychological phenomena. It can be regarded only\nas suggestive and tentative, but it seems to the writer that the later\n\f80 [part\nDr. Morton Prince.\nadditions to our knowledge of the subject tend to strengthen this\ntheory rather than oppose it.\nOne of the greatest obstacles to finding a satisfactory explanation\nof hysterical and hypnotic phenomena is the tacit assumption that the\npsychical and physical condition must be respectively always the same,\nand hence the hunt for a universal law governing these phenomena\u2014\nfor an explanation that will comprehend all the phenomena of hysteria\nin the one case, and another that will do likewise for all phenomena of\nhypnosis. The phenomena of hysteria are so complex, so various, and\ninvolve so many different functions, that in individual cases we must\ninvoke more than one psychical and physical principle. In a given\ncase, for example, the phenomena may depend in part upon the con\ntraction of the field of consciousness and conscious or subconscious\nfixed ideas ; in part upon the lack of cerebral inhibition, on the law of\nassociation of nervous processes and organic nervous memories (asso\nciation neuroses) ; in part upon the abnormal diffusion of nervous\nstimuli beyond their customary channels ; in part upon auto- or external-\nsuggestion, and so on.\nLikewise in hypnosis, in consequence of the complexity of the\nhuman brain, we have to deal with such varied phenomena that no\nsingle law will cover all cases. For instance, even in somnambulism\nthe phenomena in individual instances are so fundamentally dissimilar\nthat any attempt to refer them all to a single physiologico-anatomical\nbasis must necessarily be unsuccessful. To be more specific, there may\nbe a complete loss of memory, in the somnambulistic state, of the whole\nprevious normal life, including even a loss of educational acquirements,\nas for instance in the case of Mary Reynolds.1 This young lady not\nonly had forgotten all her previous life but had forgotten even how to\nread and write, and was obliged to learn these accomplishments over\nagain. In either state, normal or somnambulistic, she had no know\nledge of the other. The cerebral process affected in such a case, and\nthe functioning centres, or association tracts remaining, must be very\ndifferent from that of a case like the well-known Felida, reported by\nAzam. Felida in her second state not only remembers the whole of her\npast life, but has more acute powers than in the normal state. Again\nthere are fundamental differences between these cases and that of M.\nMesnet's sergeant, who in his normal state had lost every sense\nexcepting that of touch ; and all these cases of so-called somnambulism\nshow marked differences from the induced somnambulism as ordinarily\nobserved in healthy subjects. It may be convenient, in view of our\ndeficient knowledge of the nervous processes involved, to define all\n1 This case, originally reported by Dr. Mitchell, of New York, is the one referred\nto by M. Binet in his Alteration) of Personality, p. 4. The fullest account of it will\nbe found in Harper's Magazinc for May, 1880.\n\fxxxiv.] Contribution to Study of Hysteria and Hypnosis. 81\nthese states as somnambulism. A single term emphasises the analogies\nbetween in other respects different classes of facts ; but it should not\nbe lost sight of when we seek a physiological explanation, that, in\nspite of the general similarities, the physiological processes or cerebral\nareas involved must be dissimilar, and the adequacy of an explanation\ndesigned for one set of facts must not be measured by its adequacy for\nanother. It is probably after all a question of cerebral localisation.\nJust as an impairment of the functions of the Rolandic region will\nexhibit itself by loss of muscular power, slight or absolute, limited to\nthe hand, or involving the whole side of the body, and an impairment\nof the function of the occipital lobe by impairment of vision, according\nto the extent of cortical territory involved and intensity of the morbid\nchange, so probably different varieties of somnambulism and hysterical\nstates may be obtained, according to the extent of area or number of\ncentres in the highest level whose function is suppressed.\nA point which may be parenthetically raised here is whether in\nsome cases of hysteria with physical defects like anaesthesia and\nparalysis, the so-called somnambulistic condition with restored func\ntions is really a somnambulistic condition at all, but rather is not the\nnormal state, the subject having been restored to a normal state out of\na hystero-hypnotic state. It must not, then, be assumed that the\nanatomico-physiological theory here advanced is intended to cover all\nforms of hysteria or hypnosis. The theory supposes a localised \" going\nto sleep \" of certain portions of the brain (highest level of Hughlings-\nJackson). Such an explanation is applicable only to the classical but\nprobably most numerous class of cases, viz., to that \" automatic con\ndition \" to which the ordinary but fully hypnotised person is reduced.\nIn those more elaborate states to which so much prominence has been\ngiven of late years, and which have been described as spontaneous\nsomnambulism, double personalities, etc., disturbances of other portions\nor localised areas of the brain are probably involved.\nIn this connection the recent anatomical investigations of Flechsig,\nand the theory which he has propounded are of interest. In his late\naddress \" Gehirn und Seele,\" Flechsig claims to have demonstrated\nthe existence of regions in the brain unconnected with the projection\nsystem of fibres ; but in connection with the various sensory centres\nby means of association fibres. These regions, the so-called silent\nareas of the brain, Flechsig looks upon as association centres, where\nthe various sensory impressions are associated together to form\nmemories. The frontal lobe is one of these association centres, and\nhere, perhaps, in particular are stored the memories which make up a\nperson's individuality. This is only putting in different language the\nsame conception advocated by Hughlings-Jackson, the \" association\ncentres\" taking the place of the \"highest level \" It is noteworthy that\nQ\n\f82 [part\nDr. Morton Prince.\nFlechsig by the anatomical method should have arrived at conclusions\npractically identical with the inductions which Hughlings-Jackson\nreached from the clinical side. Bianchi1 has also offered a similar\ntheory, viz., \" that the frontal lobes are the seat of coordination\nand fusion of the incoming and outgoing products of the several\nsensory and motor areas of the cortex. . . . The frontal lobes\nwould thus sum up into series the products of the sensori-motor regions\nas well as the motive states which accompany all the perceptions, the\nfusion of which constitutes what has been called the psychical tone of\nthe individual.\"\nIf Flechsig's observations shall be confirmed, it may be that many\nof the phenomena of hysteria and hypnosis are to be explained by a\nsuppression of function of these association centres, the variations in\nthe phenomena depending on the extent to which the centres are\naffected, or the number of centres involved. In principle this would\nbe identical with the theory advocated in my original paper, to which\nI now proceed.]\nThe cases on which the theory mentioned in the title to this paper\nis based, if not unique, nevertheless are worth reporting because of\nthe light they help to throw upon the nature of certain forms of\nhysterical anaesthesia and paralysis, and if they do not make clear the\nexact cerebral defect underlying this affection, they at least indicate\nwhat it is not.\nMore than this, it may be said that the one truth taught by cases\nof this sort is that the brain of such hysterics really does react to\nexternal impressions, notwithstanding the apparent presence of\nanaesthesia. In other words, that an hysteric who has, to all outward\nappearances, lost the perception of sensation over a part of the body\nas well as the special senses, really does feel and see and hear. We\nmay say that such a person feels, but is not conscious that he feels.\nThe corresponding portion of the brain functions, but may be said\n(for purposes of making the clinical facts more comprehensible) not to\nbe in physiological connection with other portions of the brain.\nParadoxical as this may seem, a few simple experiments will easily\ndemonstrate the fact. The cases I have to relate present many points\nof interest, but I shall confine myself to such parts of their histories as\nbear directly upon the subject matter of this paper.\nThe first case, Mrs. B., is one of traumatic hysteria and neuritis.\nThe patient fell off a railway baggage truck, striking upon her left\nshoulder. In consequence of the accident, a number of mental\nsymptoms developed, such as insomnia, melancholia with mild suicidal\n1 Quoted by Thomas, American Journal Medical Science, November, 1896.\n\fXXXIV.] Contribution to Study of Hysteria and Hypnosis. 83\ntendencies, inability to concentrate the attention, etc. ; but besides the\nhysterical symptoms there is present a neuritis involving a portion of\nthe brachial plexus. This neuritis has been of rather moderate\nintensity but irritative in character, affecting the sensory more than\nthe motor nerves, so that the patient has suffered almost continuously\never since the accident (a period now of about two years) from most\nintense pain about the shoulder and down the arm. Almost any use\nof the arm causes severe pain, so that it is difficult to determine how\nmuch of the inability to use the arm should be ascribed to the effects\nof the pain, and how much to real paralysis. There can be no doubt,\nhowever, that decided functional paresis of nearly the whole arm exists.\nThe absence of all trophic and electrical changes in the muscles shows\nthat the paresis is not due to the neuritis, but is hysterical. Besides\nthis, nearly the only other objective symptom that was present from\nthe first has been a very slight anaesthesia, detected only by very\ncareful and delicate examination over the whole inner side of the arm\nand hand, corresponding to the distribution of the inner cord of the\nbrachial plexus.\nAfter this condition had existed for about a year and a half, it was\nnoticed that this anaesthesia suddenly had become profound, so that\nthe skin over the ulnar side of the hand could be most severely pinched\nand pricked without being felt. Most careful and accurate tests were\nmade to demonstrate the actual presence of this loss of sensation. As\nthe patient was a good hypnotic subject it was seen at once that this\nwas a chance not to be lost.\nAfter placing a screen between the patient's face and her hand, I\ntook a pin and pricked the hand several times, then laid gently upon it\na pair of small nippers with flat surfaces (such as are used in micro\nscopical work) and pinched the skin with the same. She did not feel\nthe pricks of the pin, nor did she know that anything had been done\nto her hand. It should be said that care was taken not to give the\npatient any hint of the nature of the experiment, or even that any\nexperiment was being made. She was then hypnotised. While in the\ntrance, I asked her, \" What did I do to your hand ? \"\n\" You pricked it.\"\n\" How many times ? \"\n\"A good many times, more than twelve.\"\n\" Where did I prick it ? Show me.\"\n[Patient indicated correctly with her finger the part that was\npricked.]\n\"What else did I do?\"\n\" You laid something on it.\"\n\"What?\"\n\" Something long and flat.\"\nG 2\n\f84 [part\nDr. Morton Prince.\n\"What else did I do?\"\n\" Pinched it.\"\n\"With what?\"\n\" Something you had in your hand. I don't know what it is.\"\nThe patient was then awakened and the experiment repeated with\nvariations. After being again hypnotised, she was asked what was\ndone.\n\" You pricked my hand.\"\n\" How many times 1 \"\n\" Eighteen.\"\n\" All at once ? \"\n\" No ; first five times, then thirteen.\"\n\" What else was done ? \"\n\"You pinched it.\"\n\" How many times ? \"\n\" Five.\"\n\" What did I pinch it with ? \"\n\" Your fingers.\"\nThese answers were all correct.\nThese experiments were afterwards repeated publicly before the\nBoston Society for Medical Improvement. Another fact of some\nimportance, though one that has been noticed before in similar cases,\nshould be mentioned here, namely, that during the hypnotic trance,\nsensation completely returned in the previously anaesthetic hand, so\nthat any manipulation of the skin was immediately noticed by the\npatient. It may be said incidentally, and as further evidence of the\nmerely functional nature of the anaesthesia, that normal sensation was\nrestored later by means of hypnotic suggestion.\nBefore commenting on this case I will describe my second patient,\nwho presented somewhat similar phenomena. Only a few of the more\nprominent features need be referred to here.\nCase 2. Mrs. R.'s most prominent disability is hemi-anaesthesia.\nThe loss of sensation over the right half of the body is only slight in\nintensity, but in the arm it is marked. In the hand there is an\nabsolute loss of tactile, thermal, muscular and pain sense. You may\npinch, prick and rub the skin, twist and bend her fingers without her\nhaving any knowledge of the fact. The wrist may also be bent\nwithout her knowledge, unless the movement be rough. You may\nplace in her hand objects, such as a knife, pencil and a pair of scissors\n(the thumb and forefinger being thrust through the holes), without\nher being aware of the fact. She fingers them, handles them, but\ndoes not feel them. A bracelet-like line limits the absolute anaesthesia\nof the hand at the wrist joint. Right hemianopsia is also present.\n[The line of division passes through the centre of vision.]\n\fxxxiv.] Contribution to Study of Hysteria and Hypnosis. 85\nHearing, spiel] and taste are diminished on the right side ; in fact\nsmell and taste are almost lost.\nThere is no paralysis, although there has been a history of impaired\nmuscular power on the right side fn the past.\nThere is gray atrophy of both discs. This has been confirmed by Drs.\nWadsworth and Williams. The acuteness of vision is nearly normal.1\nIn considering the nature of the affection from which this woman\nsuffers, I think there are few who would not say at first sight that we\nhave to do with a lesion of the internal capsule. The hemianopsia\nwith optic atrophy certainly means a focal disease somewhere between\nthe cortex and the optic chiasm, and if it be placed in the neighbour\nhood of Charcot's sensory crossway it would cause the hemianaesthesia\nin the classical way. But it is very easy to demonstrate that the\nhemianaesthesia, at least, whatever be the cause of defect of vision, is\nnot due to a lesion in this situation, or at any rate to one that causes\nan interruption to the centripetal fibres that pass upwards through this\nportion of the capsule on the way to the cortex. Indeed, it is very easy\nto demonstrate that in one sense of the word there is no loss of\nsensation in this case at all, in spite of all the tests that have been\ngiven. In one sense of the word this patient feels perfectly, and if she\nfeels, if it can be shown that by changing the conditions of the\nexperiment the patient is conscious of every impression given to her\nhand and has a thorough knowledge of the location, etc., of her fingers,\nit must be admitted that the paths of conduction from the periphery\nto the cortex, as well as the cortex itself, must be intact. To show\nthis, we have only to hypnotise her. Now touch her hand or body or\nfoot ever so lightly and she feels it perfectly. You may place objects\nin her hand, the same that she failed to recognise before, and she tells\ntheir names immediately, without hesitation. She says at once knife,\nscissors, rubber bands, etc. The translation from an insensible hand\nto one that is perfectly normal, is startling. The special senses have\nreturned as well. In fact so far as her physical powers are concerned,\nshe is perfectly normal. Wake her up and the hand and the whole\nright side lose at once what they recovered. One symptom alone\npersists during the hypnotic state\u2014she does not see out of the right\nhalf of each eye ; a further proof that the hemianopsia is due to an\norganic lesion.\nIt is a necessary induction from these facts that the centripetal\nfibres to the inner capsule and the sensory centres in the cortex must\nbe intact, and the anaesthesia must be functional.\nIt may be suggested that, although there is no organic lesion\ncausing the hemianaesthesia, yet there may be some change, dynamic\n1 The macula apparently was not involved in the atrophy.\n\f86 [part\nDr. Morton Prince.\nor vasomotor, which prevents the passage of impressions in the waking\nstate and disappears during hypnosis, allowing sensory stimuli to be\nfelt. In other words, under hypnosis the cortex and sensory paths\nresume their activity but lose it again when the subject is awake. But\nit is not difficult to show that this is not the condition of affairs we\nhave to deal with, for it can be demonstrated that this patient feels\nwith her right hand, not only when hypnotised, but when awake.\nThe following is one of numbers of experiments made for this\npurpose :\u2014While Mrs. R. is awake I squeeze the fingers of the right\nhand, prick the hand with a pin, close and open the fingers, place a\npencil, scissors and my knife in the palm,\u2014and she has no knowledge\nof what has been done. She says she feels nothing. She is now\nhypnotised.\n\" What did I do to your hand when you were awake ? \" I ask.\n\" You stuck a pin in it.\"\n\" How many times ? \"\n\" One, two, three, four, five.\"\n\"What else?\"\n\" You put a pencil, scissors, and your finger in it.\"\n\"What else?\"\n\" Nothing.\"\n\" What else did I do ? \"\n\" Pinched it.\"\n\"What else?\"\n\" Doubled it up.\"\n\" Anything else t \"\n\" No.\"\n\"Sure?\"\n\" Yes.\"\nThese answers were correct,i The anaesthetic hand then really did\nperceive, so to speak, the impressions, and that, too, as intelligently as\na normal hand, although at that time the patient was not conscious of\nit. From this it seems to me that the conclusion is inevitable that the\nsensory conducting fibres from the periphery to the brain, as well as\nthe cortical sensory centres, are physiologically normal in this case.\nThese cases seem to me to show that in hysterical anaesthesia of this\nsort the sensory cortical centres receive and record external impressions\nin a perfectly healthy way, and whatever may be at fault in such cases\nthe defect is not to be found in these regions.\nThere is another piece of evidence which goes to show that the\nanaesthetic hand of such patients really, so to speak, feels. It will be\n1 The only answer about which there may be doubt ia the number of times the\nhand was pinched.\n\fxxxiv.] Contribution to Study of Hysteria and Hypnosis. 87\nremembered that Mrs. R. was described as deftly fingering and turning\nover in her hand any object placed in it, but was unconscious of the\nnature of the object. Unless the hand \" felt \" the object she could\nnot possibly use the hand in this way.\nOne naturally asks for an explanation of such phenomena as these.\nCan we find any physiological basis upon which they may rest 1\nHughlings-Jackson has pointed out that three different levels of\nevolution may be distinguished in the central nervous system. These\nthree strata are both anatomically and physiologically distinct, but are\narranged as an hierarchy. In the lowest level are to be found the most\norganised, the most automatic, and the least complex nervous arrange\nments. The highest level contains the least organised, the least\nautomatic (or most voluntary) and most complex arrangements. The\narray of evidence which Hughlings-Jackson marshals in support of this\nplan of development is so strong and convincing as almost to take it\nout of the field of hypothesis. I shall not be able here, however, to\nrefer to the mass of facts physiological and pathological on which it is\nbased, but shall only state briefly so much of the general scheme as\nmay be necessary for my purposes.\nIn the lowest level are included the spinal cord, medulla, and the\nbrain-stem as high as the nuclei of the cerebral nerves. The middle\nlevel contains Terrier's motor region and certain portions of the sensory\nregion. The highest level includes much of the sensory region and all\nthat portion of the brain anterior to the so-called motor region, that is,\nthe greater part of the frontal lobes. Ferrier's motor region (central\nconvolutions, etc.) Hughlings-Jackson has named \" middle motor,\"\nbecause he believes all the frontal lobes anterior to Ferrier's motor\nregion to be also motor in character. These are the highest motor\ncentres. The highest level is concerned with the more complex forms\nof ideation.\nThe centres in the lowest level are the most simple and the most\norganised. They represent comparatively limited regions of the\nbody. For example, a nucleus in the lumbar enlargement represents\nonly a limited number of movements. These movements are simple\nand they are most automatic, in the sense that they may go on by\nthemselves with greater or less independence of all other centres. These\ncentres are also most organised. Comparatively simple combinations\nof movement are developed at an early period, which persist with\nrelatively little modification.\nIn the middle stratum, Ferrier's motor region, the movements are\nmore complex, and they represent wider regions of the body. The\nsame parts are represented as below in the lowest level, but in a more\ncomplicated manner. They are less automatic, and the centres are\nless organised, as development is continually taking place in them,\n\f88 [part\nDr. Morton Prince.\nallowing new combinations of movements. It is here, probably, that\noriginate the movements engaged in writing, sewing, typewriting, and\nthe various manual occupations after they have been once acquired.\nIn the highest level, in the anterior lobes, all parts of the body are\nrepresented, but in more complex combinations still. This level repre\nsents over again what has been represented in the middle motor region,\nwhich re-represented in its turn what was represented in the lowest\nlevel. In passing then from the lowest level (the spinal cord) to the\nhighest level (the anterior lobe), we meet with \"increasing complexity\nor greater intricacy of representation, so that ultimately the highest\nmotor centres co-ordinate movements of all parts of the body in the\nmost special and complex combinations.\"\nThe highest centres, like all other parts of the brain, are sensori\nmotor, and it is probable that they supply the greater part of the\nphysical basis of consciousness.\nLooked at from a purely physical point of view, all parts of\nthe brain must be \" sensori-motor.\" The term sensori-motor is not\nsynonymous with sensation and volition, but refers to the physical\ncerebral process alone. It is impossible to conceive that at some\nparticular point, the brain processes cease to be \"sensori-motor,\" and\nbecome something else. It would be opposed to the doctrine of evolu\ntion. The highest centres can differ from the lower centres only in\nmore intricate combinations of movements and impressions. There is\nevery reason to believe that the highest centres represent movements\nas well as impressions. This conclusion is based on a study of many\nclinical facts, and particularly those of epilepsy. I will not dwell on\nthe evidence which may be adduced in support of this statement, as\nwe are more particularly concerned with the sensory centres. It is\nmentioned here only for the sake of completeness.\nThe highest sensory centres likewise represent all parts of the body\nin intricate combinations. Sensory impressions received in the middle\ncentres are co ordinated in the highest centres with other impressions\nand with movements, and there have their psychical counterparts as\nideation, volition, emotion, and other states of consciousness.\nAccepting, then, this anatomical scheme as approximately correct,\nlet us see if we can build upon it a psycho-physiological scheme which\nwill correspond with normal psychological experience on the one hand,\nand pathological facts on the other.\nIn the first place, it is a familiar fact that there is a sort of duality\nto consciousness, which exhibits itself in two ways. One way is that\nwhile intently thinking about one thing we may be doing another of\nan entirely irrelevant character, and the thing we are doing may not\nonly involve movements of considerable complication, but these move\nments may be constantly corrected and guided by sensory impressions\n\fxxxiv.] Contribution to Study of Hysteria and Hypnosis. 89\nfrom our environment. Furthermore, these impressions, although thus\nacting on the organism, may not be perceived by the individual.\nMovements of this kind are recognised as in a greater or less degree\nautomatic, according to the vividness with which they and the incom\ning sensory impressions enter into consciousness.\nThe second way in which duality is exhibited is in compound\nmovements which are primarily and as a whole the result of direct\nvolition, yet are made up of a series of simpler and co-ordinated\nmovements ; these simple movements are not directly willed, but\nseem to take place automatically, without our being conscious of any\neffort in, or with almost no knowledge of, their production. In fact\nwe may have to direct special attention to learn how we make such\nmovements, and to analyse the successive steps in the synchronous\noccurrences. As familiar instances of this may be mentioned the\nmovements concerned in buttoning a coat, or those of a well-drilled\nsoldier doing the manual at arms, or in shaving the beard. \"When we\nbutton our coats, we may do it while we are thinking of something\nelse, in which case we have an example of the first form of dual\nconsciousness ; or the act may be initiated by volition, and thus be\nan act represented in consciousness, but in most instances we do not\nconsciously move the different fingers by successive efforts of volition,\nas I do now,\u2014first the thumb and forefinger, then removing the fore\nfinger, bring into play the thumb and middle finger, and then removing\nthe latter, complete the act by the tip of the thumb. The co-ordination\nof these different movements seems to take place unconsciously and\nautomatically. In fact I did not know how I did it in detail until I\nwatched my hand and observed the sensory impressions guiding each\nstep. My conscious mind wills the resultant act as a whole, and the\ncomponent movements are made unconsciously. A little observation\nwill show that a very large number, if not the majority, of our acts\nare thus made up of these two kinds of movements, the volitional\nand the unconscious (automatic). It would seem as if there were two\nminds, one the self-conscious mind which gave the general order, and\nthe unconscious mind which carried out the details. A very pretty\nexperiment in evidence of this was the following. Writing is an art\nwhich is partly volitional and partly unconscious. Very few of us\nprobably have any idea what contractions of the fingers we make in\nforming the letters, or, for that matter, are conscious of crossing our\nt's, dotting our i's, or forming our letters. Now it is very easy to\nobtain automatic writing with Mrs. R. On one occasion the automatic\nand an\u00bbsthetic hand wrote the verse, \" Mary had a little lamb,\" etc.,\nwithout Mrs. R. being conscious of it. She was then hypnotised and\nasked what the hand had written. She answered correctly. When\nasked if she had made any mistakes she said \" Yes,\" and added that\n\f90 [part\nDr. Morton Prince.\nshe had left out such a letter, failed to cross such a t, and dot such an\ni, which was correct. This would indicate that such details were\ndirectly controlled by one part of the mind.1\nThis duality of consciousness (the conscious or volitional and the\nunconscious or automatic), exhibits itself in the greater part of our\ndaily acts.\nNow if Hughlings-Jackson's anatomical scheme is correct, it would\npresumably follow that the conscious movements originate in the fore\nbrain, or highest level, and the greater part2 of the unconscious move\nments, in the middle level, or Rolandic-motor area. Otherwise this\nscheme is unintelligible.\nLet us now go one step further, and see if we can make out the\nprobable relationship between the middle motor and sensory regions\nand the frontal lobes, on the basis of our present physiological and\npathological knowledge.\nIn the first place, we know that sensory impressions arriving\nsimultaneously from the eye, the ear, the skin, and various parts of the\nbody, are primarily received and recorded as sensations in the second\nlevel. Here we also fairly may claim to know that they are associated\ntogether among themselves and to a certain extent with the vestiges\n(memories) of similar impressions of the past. At this level then, our\ndaily experiences may be recorded and become chains of memories, or\nassociated impressions which may make up a personality, but a\npersonality of limited attainments. The activity of such a personality\nis comparatively simple and automatic. That is to say, the sensory\nimpressions received at the second level may result at once in outward\nexpression or muscular action (through its Rolandic-motor centres) ;\nbut such immediate response means automaticity and simplicity. The\nmovements are a little complicated. It is probable, for example, that\nthe elementary movements concerned in writing, sewing, speaking,\nwarding off an expected blow, changing the posture, altering the\ndirection of our walk to avoid obstacles, playing games, like tennis,\netc., etc., are all performed at this level. But the sensory impressions\nreceived at the middle level may not result in immediate movement, or\nwhether they do or not they (generally) are transmitted to the highest\nlevel (the frontal lobes), where they become associated with that great\nnetwork of vestiges (memories) of past impressions which constitutes\nthe whole experience (intellectual and physical) of the individual. The\nactivity of this level is the dominant consciousness for the time being\nof the individual, and so long as it is in activity, its the personality of\n1 The conditions were such that Mrs. R. could not see the writing. Of course in\nthis experiment all the writing was done automatically, but in ordinary conscious\nwriting we are not conscious of such details.\n2 Not all, for many undoubtedly originate in the third level.\n\fxxxiv.] Contribution to, Study of Hysteria and Hypnosis. 91\nthe individual. Now, in so far as a sensory impression at the middle\nlevel is transmitted, received, and associated with the complicated\nprocesses of the highest level, is it perceived (recognised) by the\npersonality, becomes a part of the dominant state of consciousness,\nand the \" person \" is said to perceive this or that. If the highest level\nis in activity, even though a sensory impression is received at the\nmiddle level, and therefore \" felt,\" so to speak, by this part of the\nbrain, it is not felt by the individual unless it becomes associated with\nthe processes in the fore brain (highest level). If it stops at the\nmiddle level, it becomes a part of a definite personality if the highest\nlevel is not in activity ; or, as associations are necessarily formed in\nthe middle level, whenever the activity of the frontal lobes alone is\nsuppressed the dominant consciousness becomes that of the middle\nbrain, and all the impressions that have been there received and\nwelded together stand out as a personality which has \" felt \" all the\nsensory impressions composing it.\nNow it may be that the highest level and the second level may act\nmore or less independently and simultaneously, like two distinct but\nconnected brains. While the highest level is carrying on a complicated\ntrain of thought and even expressing these thoughts in words, the\nsecond level may be automatically doing something else, like guiding\nthe individual in his walk through a crowd, or sewing, knitting,\nplaying a game, etc.\nAlthough, for the most part, the highest level is so in rapport with\nthe second level that it is cognisant of the greater part of that which\nthe second level feels and does, and maintains a guiding control over\nits actions, this is not wholly nor always so. Many sensory impressions,\n\u2014sounds, sights and tactile feelings,\u2014may enter and be recorded at the\nsecond level which never reach the highest level, and therefore do not\nenter the dominant consciousness. This is particularly exemplified in\nabsent mindedness, i.e., where a person is not conscious of impressions\nfrom his environment ; and yet such impressions were recorded as\nsensations, for they afterwards may be remembered in dreams and\nhypnosis. Similarly, the union may be so severed temporarily that\nthe middle brain may perform many acts of which the frontal lobes\nare unconscious. Such acts are typically automatic. The more\nunconscious the highest level is of the middle level, or, to speak more\nprecisely, the less the activity of the latter enters into association with\nthat of the former, the less controlled and less complex and the more\n\" unconsciously \" automatic are the actions of the middle level.\nThis dual activity of the two levels may be illustrated on the sensory\nside by the well-known observation of Dessoir. A gentleman was\nabsorbed in reading a book while a conversation was going on about\nhim in the same room. On being questioned it was found that he was\n\f92 [part\nDr. Morton Prince.\nentirely unconscious of what had been said. He was then hypnotised,\nand while in hypnosis was able to repeat the conversation. Here we\nmay assume that the highest level was entirely occupied with the\nthoughts suggested by the book, while the middle level was receiving\nand recording the language of the conversation. The association\nbetween the two levels was temporarily suspended. Dual activity, of\nwhich that of the second level is motor and purely automatic, probably\nhas been experienced by every one on similar occasions ; as when\nengaged in deep thought while dressing, the wrong clothes have been\nput on, or, at other times, objects have been taken up and misplaced,\nor, to use more common illustrations, sewing, knitting and other\nmechanical work has been done. This dual activity, when persisting\nwith complete independence by the middle level of the highest level, is\nis called absent mindedness. A good illustration is an observation of\nhimself by the writer. On a late occasion, being impatient to learn the\nnews, he read the newspaper while walking along the street. After a\ntime he became conscious of the fact that, although completely absorbed\nin the newspaper he maintained his direction and avoided obstacles\nas accurately as under ordinary circumstances, while occasionally his\nattention would be awakened to exceptional objects in the sidewalk\n(hydrant covers). It required only a moment's observation to discover\nthat, although central vision was upon the newspaper, the peripheral\nparts of the retina saw the sidewalk and the houses on the one side, and\nthe curbing and street on the other. Walking was here probably\ndirected automatically by the occipital lobes (middle level). Similar\nexperiences are well known and have happened to us all, as when\nengaged in deep thought or animated conversation we have walked\nalong a crowded street, avoided the passers by and vehicles, perhaps\nnodded to acquaintances, all automatically, without remembrance of\nthe facts. These unconscious experiences may, nevertheless, come out\nafterwards in dreams. Parenthetically I may remark that in this way\nmay be explained many of those so-called extraordinary dreams in\nwhich a person has dreamed of the arrival of a person, or of some\naccident happening to a person of which he imagines he never heard,\nand yet, as a matter of fact, he \" unconsciously \" saw that person or\nheard of the accident under conditions which made no impression upon\nthe dominant consciousness ; that is, there was a dual activity of the\ntwo levels.\nThus far I have emphasised the independent activity of these levels.\nBut of course, such independence is not the rule. The inter-dependence\nof one level upon the other is essential for mentation that shall com\npletely subserve the intellectual wants of the individual. This\ninterdependence and co-working of the two is probably very complex,\nand with our present knowledge cannot be understood in its details.\n\fxxxiv.] Contribution to Study of Hysteria and Hypnosis. 93\n\\\nIt may be, and possibly justly, denied that the different levels ever\nfunction absolutely independently of each other. I think this is very\nlikely true. At one moment or another, in a normal healthy individual,\nthe sensory impressions and movements of the middle level make\nconnection with the highest level, and thereby come into consciousness,\nand what would have been purely automatic movements are reco-\nordinated and adjusted as volitional movements. And conversely,\nthe conscious ideation of the individual is being constantly corrected\nby sensory messages from below. Nevertheless, approximately or\nrelatively, the middle level may act as an independent organised\ncentre.\nOrdinarily, as I have said, there is mutual interaction of which the\ndetails can be but imperfectly understood. We cannot more than grasp\nthe general scheme, but there are three principles in this relation\nship which are important and have a practical bearing on the present\nproblem.\nFirst, the highest level requires, and is entirely dependent upon,\nthe second level for all intercourse with the outer world. That\nconsciousness which we call self sees and hears and feels only through\nthe consciousness of the middle level, and also acts only through this\nlevel ; that is, the highest level has to make use of the so-called sensory\nand motor centres of the middle level to feel on the one hand and act\non the other. This would seem to be a necessary inference from the loss\nof function\u2014of sensation and movement\u2014which always follows injury\nto these centres. The middle level, therefore, would know a good deal\nof the conscious life of the highest level.\nSecond. As the second level feels and acts directly without any\nintervention of the highest level, when acting automatically it would\nreceive a great many impressions and do a great many things of which\nthe highest level was unconscious ; that is, this conscious life of the\nsecond level would not always enter into that group of mental states\nwhich we call personal consciousness.\nThird. The more complex states of consciousness which make up\nthe conscious waking state of the individual have their seat in the\nhighest level, and in order that an impression received in the lower level\nmay be perceived, it must be united in the highest level with all the\nother impressions which constitute consciousness at any given moment ;\nor, in other words, inasmuch as in the last analysis consciousness must\nconsist of a compound of feelings or sensations (vivid or faint), any\ngiven state of consciousness must depend upon the combination of\nnumerous sensory [and motor] centres. And unless a given centre A\nin the middle level is physiologically associated with that group of\ncentres B, C, D, in the highest level which for the time being subserves\nconsciousness, the sensation corresponding to the given sensory centre\n\f94 [part\nDr. Morton Prince.\nA cannot be brought into the consciousness of the individual and\ncannot be perceived and recognised as belonging to the individual.\nIf, further, all the highest centres were removed or their power to\nfunction suppressed, then consciousness would be limited to the activity\nof the middle level, which would constitute a second personality, and\nwould be of a more or less automatic character.\nIn this psycho-physiological scheme which has just been outlined,\nit may be well at this place to point out that there is only one assump\ntion that is novel. The three automatic levels of evolution we owe to\nHughlings-Jackson. The duality of consciousness, that is, the division\nof mental processes into the higher complex processes of ideation and\nvolitional movements on the one hand and into the automatic subcon\nscious, or almost subconscious, processes on the other, is well recognised\nas characteristic of every mind. This duality has been more precisely\nworked out of late as conceptions of personality ;\u2014-the most complex\nassociated states of consciousness and chains of memories constituting\nthe self conscious personality of the ordinary waking state,\u2014and the\nmore automatic subconscious states constituting a second personality\nwhich plays a constant, but more or less hidden, part in the mental\ndrama of life. Subliminal consciousness is but another term to specify\ncertain particular associations of this second personality.\nThe thesis here put forward is the identification, or rather, if it is\npreferred, the correlation of the higher complex states of self con\nsciousness (first personality) with the highest level of Hughlings-\nJackson, and the correlation of the automatic more or less subconscious\nstates with the second level (the middle motor and sensory region). It\nmust be admitted that it is hardly possible, with our present knowledge,\nto offer any satisfactory proof of this correlation, such as we are\naccustomed to look for in the experimental sciences. Nor should it be\nforgotten that the same is true of our conceptions of anatomical levels\nand personalities. The best we can do is to offer a theory, provisional\nperhaps, which shall harmonise our anatomical conceptions on the one\nhand and our psycho-physiological experiences on the other. In so far\nas it does this and explains what are otherwise paradoxical phenomena\nis it of value. It seems to the writer that the theory here suggested,\nso far as it goes, fulfils the demands of the problem.\nAccepting this scheme, then, the further question arises, how does\nit correspond with observed pathological facts 1 Will it render\nintelligible the phenomena of hysterical anaesthesia as observed in\nthe two cases above reported 1 It seems to the writer that the\napparently paradoxical phenomena are just what would be expected\nfrom this scheme ; in truth they are the direct corollary of it. The\nexplanation has already been outlined above. It was observed in the\ncases of Mrs. B. and Mrs. R. that, notwithstanding apparent loss of\n\fxxxiv.] Contribution to Study of Hysteria and Hypnosis. 95\nsensation, tactile impressions were really felt but not perceived, that is,\ndid not enter into the group of conscious states which constituted the\nself-conscious personality. How can a person at the same time both\nfeel and not perceive that he feels ? Now according to this hypothesis,\nancesthesia of hysteria is the inhibition or going to sleep of certain\nlimited areas {or centres) of the highest level [frontal lobes), while\nhypnosis is the more or less {according to the stage) complete inhibition\nor going to sleep of the frontal lobes as a whole.\nIn hysteria there is a local suppression offunction ; in complete\nhypnosis, a total suppression offunction of the highest level.\nTake the case of Mrs. R. I prick her anaesthetic hand a definite\nnumber of times ; I place in it a pair of scissors, which she fingers.\nNeither the pricks nor the touch of the object does she \"feel.\" What\nis the matter t Where is the fault 1 We know it is not in the nerves.\nIt cannot be in the middle tactile centre, for then not only would any\ngiven tactile impression, a prick, be not perceived, but it would not\nbe received at all, and by no device (like hypnosis) could what never\nhad been received be revived as a memory. If on the other hand\nwe suppose that there is a local suppression of function in the frontal\nlobes (highest level), Mrs. R. would not \" feel \" the pricks given her\nhand nor recognise the scissors, for although these sensory impressions\nwere recorded in the middle level, they stopped here. They did not\nreach the frontal lobes, and consequently become associated with\nall the other impressions of movement and sensation which, as\nnormally associated together, constitute perception. Her conscious\nness is therefore minus any given tactile impression which stopped at\nthe middle level.\nNow we hypnotise Mrs. R. What happens 1 We recognise at\nonce two phenomena.\nFirst. Sensation has returned to her hand. That is, she perceives\ntactile impressions, etc. Why ? Evidently because (under the terms\nof our theory) the activity of the frontal lobes being suppressed as a\nwhole, the states of consciousness which are \"awake \" and in rapport\nwith the outer world are those of the middle level. The association\nof these states constitutes a \" second personality,\" which feels all\nimpressions.\nSecond. This personality remembers the pricks before given the\nhand. Why ? Evidently because they were received here (although\nthey did not reach the frontal lobes), and were associated with the\nother conscious states of the personality of this level, and therefore are\nnow revived as memories.\nThird. The hypnotised subject is largely devoid of spontaneity, and\nher acts are more or less automatic. Why 1 Because these are the\ncharacteristics of the middle level.\n\f96 [part\nDr. Morton Prince.\nThus by our theory we have an intelligible explanation of the\nansesthesia of hysteria and its relation to hypnosis. It becomes com\nprehensible why a sensory impression is recorded but not perceived\nduring the waking state and yet is remembered during the hypnotic\ntrance.\nRegarding the nature of the suppression of function of hysteria,\nI do not think we are in a position to speak with any positiveness. I\ntermed it an \"inhibition\" or \"going to sleep,\" for the reason that\nthe process seems to have more analogy with sleep than any other\ncondition ; but I do not wish to be understood as insisting upon any\nprecise condition as the cause of the suppression of function. Even\nif the process were like that of going to sleep we have little idea what\nit is, but it would seem plausible that if this process should affect\ndefinite and limited areas of the brain it would account for the\nphenomenon of hysteria.\nThere are a number of other phenomena allied to those of hysteria\nwhich seem to harmonise very well with this explanation. Among\nthem may be mentioned those of double consciousness and automatic\nwriting. 1 have succeeded in obtaining automatic writing from both\nthese subjects. I will not describe these experiments at length, as\nthey have already been published1 elsewhere, but will merely mention\na few of the more important phenomena elicited. There are several\nways of obtaining writing of this sort, but a simple method is to\nhypnotise a subject and during the trance state to tell her she is to\nwrite something\u2014a verse or anything one pleases\u2014when awake.\nAfter being awakened, a pencil is put in her hand and she is given a\nbook to read aloud, or told to count backwards, or do some mental\nproblem. While her attention is occupied with this, the hand holding\nthe pencil, if placed over a sheet of paper, will write what was desired.\nThe subject herself has absolutely no knowledge of what her hand\nwrites. It was found by Professor William James that the automatic\nhand while writing became perfectly anaesthetic. I found the same\nthing with my subject, Mrs. B., after her anaesthesia was cured.\nHer hand could be severely pricked without her being conscious of\nit. It seems to me that this phenomenon may be explained by the\ntheory of hysterical anaesthesia just advanced. If there is a local\ninhibition of the highest sensory and motor centres, the hand would\nbe moved automatically by the remaining middle centres. The pain\nfollowing the pricks would not be felt, because it would not be\nassociated with the conscious states induced by reading the book, or\nwhatever the mental problem was. The impression of pain would\nremain isolated on a lower platform.\n1 Boston Medical and Surgical Journal, May 15th and 22nd, 1890.\n\fxxxiv.] Contribution to Study of Hysteria and Hypnosis. 97\nThere are also a number of very remarkable phenomena connected\nwith hysterical anaesthesia, which have been observed by Binet. Binet,\nfollowing an entirely different method, has also shown that the\nanaesthetic hands of hysterics do feel, or at least in some way do record\nthe impressions given to them. He has succeeded in obtaining\nvery elaborate movements from the hands simply by means of\ntactile impressions given to the anaesthetic skin. But even more\ninteresting, he has found that many hysterics perceive as a visual\nsensation any tactile or muscular impression. Such an hysteric sees,\nvisually, any figure or letter written on the skin. If the finger be bent\nthree times, the number three is seen as an indistinct image. The\nsubject can also tell the position given to the hand by seeing it as a\nvisual image. But after seeing the image of the hand in this way he\ncannot modify the image by any mental effort, so long as the operator\ndoes not change the position of the hand.\nAll these phenomena, it seems to me, are physiologically intelligible,\nif we assume that in anaesthesia of this kind there is an inhibition of\nthe highest centres, while the middle centres still react. Although in\nthis case the impressions received at the middle level cannot excite the\nhighest tactile centres and be perceived, they may still continue to\nexcite the highest visual centres which are normally co-ordinated with\nthe tactile centres in the perception of one's hand. The perception of\none's own hand includes a number of associated sensations, some vivid\nand some faint. Among them is the visual sense. Though the tactile\nsense fails, one of the others may be excited by an impression in the\nmiddle centres.\n\f98 Br. J. Milne BramweU. [Supplement.\nSUPPLEMENT.\ni.\nTHE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND HYPNOTISM.\nI.\u2014Address by Dr. J. Milne Bramwell.\nAt the annual meeting of the British Medical Association, held in\nEdinburgh last July, the subject of hypnotism was again brought before the\nmedical profession. A discussion, as to its phenomena and theories, was\nopened in the Psychological Section, July 29th, by Dr. J. Milne Bramwell\n(by invitation of the Council of the British Medical Association), followed by\nMr. F. W. H. Myers (who was invited by the Council to read a paper), Drs.\nYellowlees, Benedikt, Woods, Mercier, etc.\nDr. Bramwell commenced his address with a short account of a few of his\nhypnotic cases, selected for the following reasons :\u2014(1) The patients were\nnatives of our own country. (2) -All the observations had been checked by\nindependent witnesses. (3) Sufficient time had elapsed to enable the\npermanence of the therapeutic results to be fairly estimated.\nOf these the following are examples :\u2014\nCase 2.\u2014Pruritus and eczema. Mrs. A., aged 49. Suffered from\npruritus and eczema, which four years' careful treatment had failed to\nrelieve. At night the irritation was intolerable, and produced insomnia.\nThe disease, in the opinion of a well-known surgeon, was due to an organic\ncause which interfered with the circulation. An operation, performed in\norder to relieve this, proved unsuccessful. In August, 1889, Dr. Bramwell\ntried to hypnotise the patient, other treatment being abandoned. The\nattempt failed, and was repeated unsuccessfully on sixty-six occasions during\nthe next four months, the condition meanwhile growing steadily worse. At\nthe sixty-eighth s\u00e9ance somnambulism was induced. All irritation vanished\nimmediately, and the patient slept soundly on that and the following nights.\nIn a fortnight all trace of disease had disappeared, and treatment was\nabandoned. Three years later there had been no relapse.\nCase 3. \u2014Hyperhidrosis. Miss B., aged 15, January, 1890. On the back\nof the left arm, just above the wrist, a patch of skin, two and a half inches\nlong by one and a half broad, was the seat of constant perspiration. This had\nexisted from early childhood, was always excessive, and invariably rendered\nmore so by emotion or exertion. The forearm was always enveloped in\nbandages, but these rapidly became saturated, and the perspiration dripped\nupon the floor. On January 10th, the patient was hypnotised for the first\ntime, and somnambulism induced. By the following day the symptoms\nhad markedly diminished : the patient was again hypnotised, when the\nperspiration ceased. Two years later there had been no relapse.\n\fPart xxxiv] British Medical Association and Hypnotism. 99\nCase 5.\u2014Neurasthenia ; suicidal tendencies. Mr. D., aged 34, June 2nd,\n1890. Barrister. Formerly strong and athletic. His health commenced to\nfail in 1877, after typhoid fever. He was compelled to abandon work in 1882,\nand had since been a chronic invalid. He was constantly depressed, and\nsuffered from amemia, dyspepsia, insomnia, etc. He had frequent suicidal\nimpulses, and once attempted suicide. The least exertion produced acute\npain in the lower part of the spine, and he was unable to walk 100 yards\nwithout severe suffering. He had constant medical treatment, including six\nmonths' rast in bed, without benefit He was hypnotised from June 2nd to\nSeptember 20th, 1890. By the end of July all morbid symptoms disappeared,\nand he amused himself by working on a farm. He has not relapsed since,\nand can walk forty miles a day without undue fatigue.\nCase 6.\u2014Dipsomania. Mr. E., aged 33, April 30th, 1890. He had a\nfamily history of intemperance, and commenced to take stimulants in excess\nat seventeen. In 1884, his friends induced him to place himself under\ncontrol. This was repeated thrice without good results. In 1887, he\nentered a retreat for a year, but soon after leaving it began to drink as badly\nas ever. From this time he does not appear to have taken stimulants daily,\nand, according to his own account, struggled hard against the temptation to\ndo so. Any physical pain or mental trouble, however, would start a\ndrinking bout, and of these he had on an average one a week. He was\nhypnotised from April 30th, to May 17th, 1890, and during this time kept\nsober. He returned home and relapsed in less than a month. He was\nagain hypnotised daily for a week, and from that date, June 1890, until the\npresent time, he has not relapsed.\nCase 7.\u2014Dipsomania. A patient, aged 47, with bad family history of\nalcoholism. He had taken stimulants to excess for seventeen years, had\nhad three attacks of delirium tremens and seven of epilepsy. He was first\nhypnotised on April 22nd, 1895, and has not relapsed since.\nCase S.~Neuralgia of the leg. Miss F., aged 28, July 17th, 1896. She\ncomplained of pain in the leg of five years' duration, supposed to be due to\nsciatica. During the first two years of her illness she never walked more than\na quarter of a mile, then this was abandoned, and she took to a bath-chair.\nTreatment :\u2014Rest on back in bed for two months ; careful drugging ; Weir\nMitchell ; massage ; electricity ; baths at Droitwich and Bath ; Paquelin's\ncautery to leg, seventy applications daily from July, 1895, to May, 1896,\nabout 20,000 in all. During this time her condition steadily grew worse ; all\ntreatment was then abandoned, and she was considered incurable. When\nDr. Bramwell saw her she was emaciated ; complained of constant pain ; was\nunable to walk ; suffered from insomnia ; had lost all interest in life. She\nwas hypnotised on July 17th, 1896 ; completely recovered in two days, and\nlearned to cycle. At the present date she is well, active, and strong.\nIn March, 1890, Mr. Turner, of Leeds, performed many painless dental\noperations upon Dr. Bramwell's patients, and recorded the results in the\nJournal of the British Dental Association. The most remarkable case was\nthat of a young girl, suffering from valvular disease of the heart, from\nwhom he extracted five teeth.\nOn March 25th, 1890, a number of Dr. Bramwell's patients wero\noperated on at Leeds, in the presence of some sixty medical men, including\nH 2\n\f100 [Supplement.\nFrederic W. H. Myers.\nsuch well-known surgeons as Pridgin Teale, Mayo Robson, etc. A delicate\ngirl was put to sleep by written order, while Dr. Bramwell remained in\nanother room, and sixteeen teeth were extracted. She showed no signs of\npain, there was no corneal reflex, and the pulse fell during the operation.\nA boy, aged 8, suffering from exostosis of the great toe, had only been\nhypnotised on two previous occasions. Mr. Mayo Robson first performed\nevulsion of the great toe-nail, then removed the bony grownth, and part of\nthe first phalanx. Some of the patients were strong, healthy labouring men,\nothers were weak, nervous women. None suffered from pain afterwards,\nand all returned home by train\u2014a journey of over an hour. In every\ninstance the healing process was remarkably rapid.\nDr. Bramwell then gave a short account of some of his experimental\nresearches in reference to automatic writing, the appreciation of time by\nsomnambules, and more especially the condition of the volition in hypnotised\nsubjects. Taking his personal observations as a basis, he discussed how far\nthe theories of others were satisfactory in explaining them. It is unnecessary\nto refer to this portion of the paper in detail, as the greater part of it has\nalready appeared in the Proceedings of our Society. It is worthy of note,\nhowever, that although two years have elapsed since then, further experi\nment has not caused Dr. Bramwell to alter his opinions.\nHe still regards the theories of the Nancy school, especially in reference\nto so-called automatism, and the possibility of successfully suggesting crime,\nas untenable. The further evidence he has collected shows, he thinks, more\nand more clearly, that the phenomena of hypnotism are due to the intelligent\nand voluntary action of a secondary consciousness.\nII.\u2014Frederic W. H. Myers,\nHon. Secretary of the Society for Psychical Research.\nThe Psychology of Hypnotism.\nI must begin what I have to say by warmly thanking the officers of this\nAssociation for allowing a layman in this place to say anything at all, and by\nthanking this learned audience also for showing themselves thus willing to\nhear me. I feel a quite special diffidence in undertaking my present task ;\nbut I can best show my sense of the honour done me by speaking frankly\non, without further preface or apology.\nI understand that what is asked from me is some attempt at a coherent\npsychological presentation of the multifarious and perplexing facts now\ncommonly grouped under the name of hypnotism. Purely physiological\nexplanations thereof have, by common admission, thus far failed ; and little\nattempt has yet been made by the able practical hypnotists, to whom the\nrecent advance in our knowledge is owing, to correlate their ever-growing\nobservations from a purely psychological point of view. My late friends,\nEdmund Gurney and Professor Delbteuf of Liege, did, indeed, apply to\nthese problems minds of unusual acuteness. They and others have said\nmuch of value ; but much more remains to be said than any of us in this\ngeneration can hope to say. My own attempt at synthesis will fall far short\nboth of certainty and of completeness ; but its very imperfections may\n\fPart xxxiv.) The Psychology of Hypnotism. 101\nindicate how great the difficulties are which have to be faced ; how wide and\npenetrating a survey is needed if these phenomena, often so superficially\ndescribed, are to carry us, as they ought some day to do, deep into the\nmysteries of human personality.\nI say then, as my first and surest remark, that in order to understand\nhypnotism we must bring into comparison a great mass of cognate life-\nphenomena, both spontaneous and induced. From the lack of wide\ncomparison, from the confinement of attention to some few of the commoner\nand more obvious manifestations of hypnosis, have sprung most of those\nnarrow and misleading theories of which Br. Bramwell has spoken. But\nthere is now no excuse for such narrowness. Far more facts have become\nmatter of common knowledge than Despine, or Heidenhain, or Charcot knew ;\nand even a cursory glance at the recent annals of hypnotism will show at\nhow many points its problems touch on problems already familiar in other\nfields of research.\nLet us briefly dwell on each main group of these problems in turn. In\nhypnotic records we find, to begin with, abundant instances of isolated\nlosses and gains of faculty resembling the fantastic associations and\ndissociations, dynamogrnies and inhibitions, which characterise hysteria.\nWe find, too, that uprush into consciousness of ideas or impulses, matured\nbeneath the conscious threshold, which forms, in my view, the best definition\nof genius. We find that interruption of external attention, along with that\nprofound organic recuperation, which are the marks of sleep. We find the\nchange of personality, the intercurrence of memories, which in their slighter\nforms are called somnambulisms, or sleep-waking conditions, and which may\nexist quite apart from hysteria. Finally, we observe in hypnosis\u2014rarely\nindeed, yet, as I hold, unmistakeably\u2014certain forms of supernormal\nsensibility which bring hypnotism into connection with all those facts (as I\nmust needs regard them) to which I have given the names of \"telepathy\"\nand \" tehesthesia.\"\nHypnotism and Hysteria.\nLet us begin with one of the most obvious of these analogies,\u2014the\nanalogy between hypnotism and hysteria. How far does this analogy\nextend ? In broad outline the answer is plain enough. Both in hypnosis\nand in hysteria there is a disaggregation of the personality. Instead of the\ncontinuous personality of common life, with its one familiar alternation of\nsleep and waking, there are minor changes of phase, interruptions of\nmemory, irregularities of will, inhibitions of faculty, something capricious\nand multilated in the manifestations of the self. In the case of hysteria\nthese changes are plainly degenerative. They indicate what Dr. Pierre\nJanet calls misere psychologique, some weakness in the grasp which holds\ntogether all our separate fragments of motor and sensory capacity under\nthat central dominance which makes the organism a unity. Scraps of\ncapacity drop out from that dominance ; the muscles, for instance, which are\ninnervated by some special centre, sink down beneath the threshold of con\nscious will. The hysteric, let us say, gets a fixed idea that he cannot move\nhis left arm. So long as this idea persists,\u2014and there is no trustworthy\nmedical method of removing it,\u2014the man's arm is in effect lost to him ; it is\npsychically paralysed, and as useless as if the governing brain-centres were\n\f102 [Supplement.\nFrederic W. 11. Myers.\nactually destroyed. And here the thought at once occurs that this is exactly\nthe kind of effect which the platform hypnotist produces by suggestion. His\nsuggestion, like the hysteric's self-suggestion, deprives the man of the use of\nhis arm ; he induces a form, though a brief and curable form, of psychical\nparalysis. The recognition by the Paris school of analogies of this kind\nbetween hypnotism and hysteria was originally, as I conceive it, a forward\nstep\u2014a result mainly of the increased care and intelligence with which\nhysteria had been studied by Charcot and his disciples.\nBut the last word on the matter has certainly not yet been said. If we\nlook a little deeper into those analogies, we shall discover the point at\nwhich they begin to be misleading\u2014the point at which hysterical and\nhypnotic workings, although in pari materia, begin to be in effect almost\nexactly opposite the one to the other.\nExpressed in a sentence, the difference is this : In hysteria we lose from\nsupraliminal control portions of faculty which we do not wish to lose, and\nwe cannot recover them at will. In hypnotism we lose from supraliminal\ncontrol portions of faculty which we wish to lose, or are indifferent to losing,\nand we can recover them the moment that we will.\nA good way, I think, of presenting these two notions together is to call\nthat stratum into which the faculties submerged in hysteria sink the hypnotic\nstratum, and to describe hysteria as a disease of that stratum ; or say an\nundue permeability of the psychical diaphragm which separates ordinary\nconsciousness from the deeps below. This or that group of sensory or motor\nability drops out of waking knowledge or out of control of waking will.\nIn hypnotism, on the other hand, we gain instead of losing control.\nInstead of losing control over the supraliminal stratum, we gain control over\nthe hypnotic stratum. We purposely increase the permeability of the\npsychical diaphragm in such a way as to push down beneath it various forms\nof pain and annoyance which we are anxious to get lid of from our waking\nconsciousness ; while, on the other hand, we stimulate in the depths of our\nbeing many sanative and recuperative operations whose results rise presently\ninto the perception of our waking life.\nAn example will make my meaning clear. One frequent symptom in\nhysteria is a retrenchment or deformation of the visual field. The hysteric,\nwith his weakened central authority, his enfeebled attention, has lost the\nuse of the outer margin of his normal field ; he cannot see a moving finger\ntill it is almost directly in front of him. But now, instead of the finger,\nbring within the disused margin of the visual field some object associated\nwith the patient's hysterical terrors, as a lighted match or a stuffed mouse.\nIn that case, as Professor Janet has ingeniously shown, the patient will\nscream and go off into an accte long before the mouse has reached the point\nat which the mere finger would have been noticed. This means that the\npower of vision over the margin of the field, although lost for practical use,\nis retained in the hypnotic stratum, and manifests itself again at the bidding\nof a hurtful hysterical caprice.\nNow compare the result if a hypnotic suggestion is made to the patient\nwith the diminished visual field. Professor Janet, for instance, suggests to\nher that she can really see with the whole normal field. Apparently this is\nnothing more than an empty remark from which no results can be expected\n\fPart xxxiv.] The Psychology of Hypnotism. 103\nto follow. But if the patient is suggestible, if a certain appeal\u2014whose\nnature we must discuss further on\u2014is effectively made to the patient's\nsubliminal region of personality, to the hypnotic stratum in particular, then\na result does follow. The power of vision begins to return over the outer\nparts of the field\u2014fitfully, perhaps, and with relapses ; but if the suggestion\nis repeated the sight is often permanently restored. That is to say, hypno\ntism has exactly repaired the mischief which hysteria has done. It has\nacted on the same stratum, but with an increase instead of a diminution of\ncentral control. In just the ways in which hysteria can destroy hypnotism\ncan fulfil.\nSubmergence and Emergence.\nIn describing that most complex of known entities, the human mind, any\nphysical illustration whatever seems even absurdly inadequate. Yet such\nillustrations we are compelled to use, and, when not pressed too far, they\nmay be more suggestive than long abstract phrases could be. The\nnotion of upper level, middle level, and lower level nerve centres has started\nmany a fruitful thought. And somewhat similarly this present notion\u2014in\nwhich the terms upper and lower are used in a different metaphorical sense,\nthis notion of a kind of stratification of the personality above and below the\nthreshold of ordinary consciousness\u2014will be found to suggest new and\npractical questions to which it is possible to find some beginning of answer.\nThus, it is now natural to ask whether, if faculty which has existed above\nthe conscious threshold and has been unduly submerged may then emerge\nagain above that threshold, other faculty which has not ordinarily existed\nabove the threshold may ever emerge from beneath it ? Does this happen in\nthe psychical storm of hysteria ? Does it happen in normal waking life ?\nDoes it happen as a result of hypnotic suggestion ?\nOur answer must be, Yes,, it happens in all these cases. Even in hysteria\nwe often observe great tactile hyperesthesia, as in Binet's experiments,\nwhere the hysteric perceived the relieved surfaces on an unknown coin\npressed to her skin with a delicacy immensely\u2014fifty times, as Binet thought\n\u2014beyond the range of normal sensibility.\nI do not say that this hyperaesthesia was of any practical use, but it was\nfaculty ; it was faculty previously unknown, but borne upwards into the\nconscious stratum by that same psychical disturbance which carried down\nwards, and away from conscious control, many more important fragments of\nthat patient's sensory and motor power. From the practical or therapeutic\nside the hysteria brought nothing but loss to the patient ; from the psycho\nlogical side it brought also a certain gain. For the physician man's faculties\nexist for the benefit of man ; if he comes upon rare and useless capacities,\nhe dismisses them as probably morbid, and at any rate uninteresting. For\nthe psychologist, on the other hand, man's faculties exist for the knowledge\nof man ; the more rare and useless the faculty, the more interest it has for\nhim as a possible inlet into some human mystery yet unexplored.\nHypnotism and Genius.\nAnd here, in this very question of the emergence of unfamiliar faculty\nfrom a subconscious stratum, our next step shows us faculty thus emerging\nwhich is of real use ; products of subliminal mentation uprushing into\n\f104 [Supplement\nFrederic W. H. Myers.\nordinary consciousness with actual benefit to the waking life. This is the\nreply to our question asked a little way back : Does this emergence occur in\nnormal life ? My answer is that it does, and that when it does it constitutes\ngenius.\nHere again the psychological view of human faculty will differ from the\n[esthetic criterion in much the same manner as we just now saw that it\ndiffered from the medical. The aesthetic critic asks whether the thoughts\nand images which surge up ready-made into the artist's or poet's mind\u2014his\ninspirations, as he calls them\u2014are such as to give delight to other men.\nUnless they are such, the critic refuses to him the name of genius. To the\npsychologist, on the other hand, it matters little whether other men find joy\nin the artist's inspirations or no. The question which interests him is, how\nthose inspirations arise ? Can we prove that they were matured by sub\nliminal mentation, beyond the artist's conscious control, and then presented\nto him as finished products from his subterranean workshops ? If so, I\nsubmit they all share a certain definite character, to which the name of\ngenius might with real significance, although not with practical convenience,\nbe given. And this is true, although the results which can most easily be\nproved to be of subliminal manufacture are not likely to be results in the\nhighest order of art. Psychologically the best specimen of genius may\nbe the calculating boy's vision of the product of two factors of six figures\neach, seen in a flash upon a mental blackboard, with no consciousness of the\nprocess by which it was attained. The calculating boy's achievement,\nindeed, may seem a mere curiosity ; but without the type of faculty which\nthat boy has shown, the inspirations of a Shakespeare or a Raphael could\nnever have arisen to bring joy to mankind.\nThus prepared, let us go on to the next question, which to-day most\nconcerns us, the question whether hypnotism succeeds in bringing up faculty\nfrom submerged strata into conscious control or enjoyment. My answer is\nthat to do this very thing is of the essence of hypnotism. We have seen\nhow hypnotism brings up again to the surface the portions of faculty which\nhysteria has submerged. We have seen also\u2014it is an obvious inference\nfrom Dr. Bramwell's cases\u2014how hypnotism acts in parallel fashion to genius,\nby elaborating subliminally certain intellectual results which are then pre\nsented ready-made to the waking intelligence. Dr. Bramwell's milliner,\ncomputing subconsciously the far-off dates when her suggestions fell due, is\na precise parallel to the calculating boy inspired with arithmetical results\nreached by no conscious working. Or again, when she solved in the trance\na difficulty in her work, and that solution came to her in waking hours as an\ninspiration, she underwent exactly the poet's experience, though the subject-\nmatter may have been only the set of a skirt or the trimming of a bonnet.\nThat which the gift of Nature does in certain limited directions for some\nfew delicately constructed men, that can hypnotic suggestion do for the\nordinary clodhopper, with results of course grotesque in comparison to the\ntriumphs of art, but yet quite as striking in proportion to the common\nman's inferior powers. That \" objectiration de types,\" for example, which\nProfeasor Richet has best described, that assumption in speech, writing,\ndemeanour, of some suggested character which is one of the commonest\nplatform phenomena, is in fact an inspiration of genius as remarkable for\n\fPart xxxiv.l The Psychology of Hypnotism. 105\nthe rustic as the triumphs of a Duse or a Sarah Bernhardt are for their\nmuch higher organisations.\nAnd here I come to one of the commonest phenomena of hypnotism\u2014\nusually spoken of as a mere jest or a mere indication of the hypnotiser's\npower over his patient\u2014but which the psychologist, I think, is bound to\nregard as one of the most striking of all our indications of latent faculty.\nI speak of the hallucinations which the hypnotiser suggests in the entranced,\nor sometimes even in the waking, subject. Such a hallucinatory image is,\nstrictly speaking, an inspiration of genius, even if it represents nothing\nbetter than a black cat. The painter's highest joy consists in the sudden\nemergence into perceptibility of some fair form created below the threshold :\nthe \"flash upon the inward eye \" of some remembered or transmuted image\nwhich deliberate efforts could neither shape nor recall. As the Sistine\nMadonna was to Raphael, so to the hypnotised girl is the delusive cat. The\ngirl in her ordinary state can no more conceive with deceptive distinctness\nthat feline image than Raphael every day could hang in heaven a form of\nsupernal beauty. Hypnotised, the girl can see the creature's very crouch\nand spring ; she has evoked from her subterranean treasure-house of\nimagination a picture incomparably more vivid than waking imaginative\neffort could have afforded her.\nYet all this lies, so to say, but on the fringe of hypnotic power. The\nmain interest of hypnotism lies in a still deeper evocation of latent faculty.\nThe fact which is bringing hynotism before the medical profession is not its\npower to imitate and in some sense to outdo the achievements of genius, but\nits power to imitate, and greatly to outdo, the achievements of sleep.\nHypnotism and Sleep.\nThe relation of hypnotism to sleep was the next point marked out for our\ndiscussion. Here, again, I must begin by giving to sleep a psychological\ndefinition.\nI regard sleep as an alternating phase of our personality, distinguished\nfrom the waking phase by the shutting off of the supraliminal life of\nrelation, of external attention, and by the concentration of subliminal\nattention upon the profounder organic life. To sleep's concentrated inward\nattention I ascribe its unique recuperative power. Our entry into this\nphase of our personality is not wholly a voluntary thing. Sometimes it is\nhindered by physical causes, as by pain ; always (as some hold) it needs to\nbe helped on by physical causes, as by the accumulation of waste products\nin the brain. The first obvious effect of hypnotism is to bring sleep more\nfully under our control. Under hypnotic suggestion people fall asleep\nwithout fatigue to help them, and sleep on so that no tortures can wake\nthem\u2014sleep on in the dentist's chair or through the great pain and peril of\nchildbirth. They can remain at will in that regenerative phase of person\nality which for us needs so much physiological preparation, and is subject to\nso many pathological checks.\nIt is, of course, from my point of view, perfectly natural that an\nincrease of power over the personality should facilitate our transitions between\nits different phases. But when a phase so profoundly withdrawn from\noutward stimulus can thus be produced, ought we to give it the name of\n\f106 [Supplement.\nFrederic W. H. Myers.\nsleep, or rather of trance 1 Trance is the better word ; for to identify\nhypnotic with ordinary sleep is to underrate the modifiability of this almost\ninfinite complex of sentient units which we call a man. I have called the act\nof falling asleep a passage into another phase of personality ; but such\npassages are like the irregular heatings and coolings of a molten mass ; the\ngaseous, the liquid, the solid state each has certain stable laws of its own ;\nbut every transition involves millions of molecular changes which can never\noccur twice in just the same way. There is something in sleep that reminds\none of some increase of internal heat caused by the collapse of a cooled\nsurface ; for in sleep, along with the decrease of responsiveness to the\nexternal world, certain inward movements become more active, more pro\nfoundly recuperative ; fulfil more subtly the organism's hidden need. In\nthis respect hypnotic trance is like a further stage of sleep. Not that it is\nnecessarily more lethargic, more comatose ; it has forms so alert as to be\nhardly distinguishable from waking. Trance is a further stage of sleep in\nthe sense that it accomplishes more powerfully sleep's characteristic task ;\nthe subliminal plasticity is more marked, the subliminal control intenser ;\nuntil hypnosis sometimes seems to be to sleep what sleep is to waking.\nHypnotism and Sleep-Waking States.\nNay, more. In ordinary sleep, neither hysterical nor hypnotic, certain\nphenomena from time to time occur which the physician may sometimes\nwish to check as inconvenient, but which to the psychologist should yield\nlessons much deeper than he has yet drawn from them. I speak of somnam\nbulisms or sleep-waking states, which in my view are rudiments of new\nphases of personality, useless for the most part, and destined to be abortive\nand to die away. To these nascent rearrangements of personality the\nhypnotic trance furnishes abundant parallels. Sometimes it has even hap\npened that for long periods\u2014in one case at least for a lifetime\u2014the new\nphase of personality, developed by hypnotic suggestion, has been more\nsalutary for the patient than the old. Here also hypnotic artifice has\nimproved upon the hints which Nature spontaneously gave, and has shown\nthat there is no real certainty that the particular disposition of personality\nwith which each man is born must be absolutely the best for all his life on\nearth, no proof that the kaleidoscope of his being may not be sometimes\nshaken into a more satisfactory pattern. And setting aside those extreme\ncases where one phase of personality is marked off from another by an actual\nbreak in the chain of memory, many of the sanative changes which hypno\ntism effects are morally and physically so profound as to deserve the name\nof regenerations. The suicidal melancholic, tho brutaliaed morphinomaniac\nare hardly the same persons as the active hospital nurse, the successful man\nof business, into whom hypnotic suggestion transforms them. And be it\nremembered that these sanative regenerations are both for physician and\nfor psychologist the leading facts of hypnotism\u2014the facts which call most\npressingly both for explanation and for development.\nI have now briefly reviewed the relation between hypnotism and certain\ncomparable, if not strictly cognate, conditions\u2014namely, hysteria, genius,\nsleep, somnambulism. I have shown by each comparison that the essential\nmeaning of hypnotism is always the same\u2014a fuller control over subliminal\nplasticity.\n\fPart XXXIV.] 107\nThe Psychology of Hypnotism.\nSuggestion and Self-suogestion.\nBut how, after all, is this fuller control effected I How is this subliminal\nplasticity\u2014this c\u00ab medicatrix Natnne\u2014actually reached ? On this question\nDr. Bramwell has demonstrated, with all the advantage of actual experience,\nwhat some of us foreshadowed long ago\u2014 I mean the absolute insufficiency at\npresent of any purely physiological explanation. No such explanation, iudeed,\nnow survives with sufficient vitality to be worth the trouble of killing anew.\nThe main consensus of living hypnotists declares that hypnotic phenomena\nare due to suggestion almost or quite alone. We need not reject their\ndictum, but we must make it our task to try and find out what that word\nsuggestion can mean. One thing the word certainly cannot mean, if it is to\nhave any explanatory value at all ; and that is\u2014more ordinary persuasive\nness. Dr. Bramwell (to take his own instance) is not the first person who\nhas advised the dipsomaniac not to drink. If he succeeds in reforming such\na patient, it is because he has managed to touch not his supraliminal reason,\nbut his subliminal plasticity. He has set going some intelligent organic\nfaculty in the man which has laid dormant till that moment, and which\nproves more effectual for healing than the man's conscious will. How then,\nhas he done this ? He has either infused power, or he has merely evoked it.\nEither he has added power by some influence, such as Cuvier and many\ncompetent men have believed in\u2014some influence itself subliminal, and akin\nto what I have called telepathy ; or else in some empirical way, not as yet\nunderstood, he has simply started a self-suggestion ; has unlocked, as 1 say,\nsome fountain of energy which was latent within the man's own being.\nNow for my part I certainly believe that subliminal relations between\nman and man\u2014influences and transmissions as yet unknown to science\u2014do\nplay a real part in hypnotic phenomena, especially and manifestly in the\nrare cases of the induction of trance from a distance. But I shall not here\ninsist on these transmissive influences ; for I believe that the great mass of\nhypnotic results can be, and are, accomplished without them, especially\nand manifestly in the fairly common cases where the subject can bring on the\ntrance for himself, with no external suggestion to help him.\nWhether, indeed, those results are accomplished without invoking the\nsame agency, whatever it be, which manifests itself in telepathy, is quite\nanother question. What we see in hypnotic recuperation is an apparent\ndynamogeny, or increase in organic energy ; but whence that new energy\ncomes we can only conjecture. As to this, all that our review of hypnotism\nand allied conditions has made plain is that it is from the subliminal region\nthat any new energy or new modification of energy must needs proceed.\nBeneath the threshold of waking consciousness there lies, not merely an\nunconscious complex of organic processes, but an intelligent vital control.\nTo incorporate that profound control with our waking will is the great\nevolutionary end which hypnotism, by its group of empirical artifices, is\nbeginning to help us to attain.\nIn waking consciousness I am like the proprietor of a factory whose\nmachinery I do not understand. My foreman\u2014my subliminal self\u2014weaves\nfor me so many yards of broadcloth per diem (my ordinary vital processes)\nas a matter of course. If I want any pattern more complex, I have to\nshout my orders in the din of the factory, where only two or three inferior\n\f108 [Supplement.\nFrederic W. H. Myers.\nworkmen hear me, and shift their looms in a small and scattered way. Such\nare the confined and capricious results of the first, the more familiar stages\nof hypnotic suggestion.\nAt certain intervals, indeed, the foreman stops most of the looms, and\nuses the freed power to stoke the engine and to oil the machinery. This,\nin my metaphor, is sleep, and it will be effective hypnotic trance if I\ncan get the foreman to stop still more of the looms, come out of his private\nroom, and attend to my orders\u2014my self-suggestions\u2014for their repair and\nrearrangement.\nThe question for us proprietors, then, is how we can best get at our\npotent but secluded foremen ; in what way we can make to our subliminal\nselves effective suggestions. And here, I think, we are for the present at\nthe end of theory. We must look for guidance to actual experience ; not to\nthe experience of the hypnotic clinic alone, but to all forms of self-suggestion\nwhich are practically found to remove and soothe the pains and weariness of\nlarge masses of common men. Apart from recognised forms of hypnotic\nsuggestion by others, two popular forms of self-suggestion may here stand,\nfor brevity's sake, as types of the rest. Each of these appeals to deep-\nseated faiths ; each is preached in a crude extravagant form from which the\nman of science turns with repulsion.\nThe healing fountain of Lourdes draws its prestige from the ancient\nbelief in beings higher than man who concern themselves with even the\ndetails of man's physical welfare. So-called Christian Science\u2014or mind-\ncure, to use its less presumptuous name\u2014while still relying on Christian\nrevelation, appeals most directly to the optimistic instinct in man, main\ntaining that pain and evil are non-existent shadows, and that the only\nrealities are love and joy. The conception of the miracles of Lourdes is too\nmediaeval, perhaps, to maintain itself for long. The vaguer impulse which\nprompts to mind-cure may prove more capable of adaptation to whatever may\nhereafter be learnt as to the true relation between man's central will and his\nbodily organism.\nQuestions like these as to the relative efficacy of various self-suggestions\nbelong indeed to the inmost meaning of hypnotism ; but they lie beyond the\nfacts with which the physician needs at once to deal. What is now to be\ndesired is that medical science should recognise that a new task has opened\nbefore her ; that these hypnotic artifices, empirical as they may be, do yet\nlie in the true path of therapeutic progress ; that hypnotism is no more a\ntrick than education is a trick ; but that just as education develops obser\nvation and memory, through alert attention, so hypnotism develops organic\nconcentration and recuperation, through their adjuvant phase of sleep.\nFinally, if beneath the fanaticism and the extravagance of men blindly\nseeking relief from pain some glimmering truth makes way, that truth also\nit must be for science to adopt and to utilise, to clarify and to interpret. By\none method or other\u2014and her familiar method of widespread cautious\nexperiment should surely be the best\u2014science must subject to her own\ndeliberate purposes that intelligent vital control, that reserve of energy,\nwhich lies beneath the conscious threshold, and works obscurely for the\nevolution of man.\n\fPart XXXIV.l 109\nAddresses on Hypnotism.\nIII.\u2014David Yellowlees, LL.D., M.D.,\nPhysician Superintendent, Glasgow Royal Asylum, Gartnavel, Glasgow.\nThe Uses and Dangers of Hypnotism.\nI must express the highest appreciation alike of the striking and forcible\naddress of Dr. Bramwell and of the highly philosophic and admirable paper\nof Mr. Myers. I believe the popular impression that some mysterious\npower resides in the operator is unfounded, and that the President, for\ninstance, could exert the same influence as Dr. Bramwell over a hypnotised\npatient. The essential thing is the abnormal condition induced in a patient.\nMy own experience enables me to believe even in the extraordinary cures\nrelated by Dr. Bramwell. I have obtained some remarkable results from\nmy own endeavours. On the whole, however, these have been disappoint\ning, chiefly because I have failed to hypnotise the very patients whom I\ncould most have benefited thereby. I have not persisted in my attempts\nmore than six or seven times, and the attempts have been chiefly among the\ninsane, hence perhaps the very partial success. I cannot regard hypnotism\nas free from danger, nor think it possible that we could often reach and\nawaken \"the subliminal strata of mind\" without the risk of injury. I\ntherefore utterly condemn the use of hypnotism for mere experiment or\namusement. As to crime in relation to hypnotism, it may be true, as Dr.\nBramwell has said, that a hypnotised patient would revolt from any manifest\nor gross crime, but might she not be told to sign a document, and very\ngreat evil thus be wrought ?\nIV.\u2014John F. Woods, M.D.,\nMedical Superintendent, Hoxton House Asylum, London, N.\nHypnotism in Organic Disease.\nHaving now treated over 1,000 cases of disease by so-called suggestion,\nI have, like Dr. Bramwell, come to the conclusion that it is a potent remedy,\nand that much good may be done by it if rightly employed. It is commonly\nthought that only functional nervous disorders, such as neuralgia, are\nbenefited by this treatment. This is not my experience, and my chief\nobject in speaking is to draw attention to the fact that it is applicable to a\nmuch wider field of disease. Let us not forget that the nervous system is\nimplicated in almost all disease, and in so far as we can influence it for good\nwe can benefit the disease. Take the case of organic heart mischief. At\nfirst sight it may appear irrational\u2014I had almost said ridiculous\u2014to treat it\nby suggestion. We must remember, however, that in all cases of serious\norganic disease of the heart there is a strong nervous element ; the patient\nis apt to be agitated, perhaps he sleeps badly, or there may be pain. Now,\nif we can soothe the nervous system, secure sleep, and remove pain\u2014we can\ndo all this\u2014we are going a long way to improve the patient's condition.\nMoreover, in addition to these general effects we can produce a direct and\nBpecific effect upon the heart by placing one hand upon the epigastrium and\nsuggesting that the heart shall quiet down, and beat more slowly and\n\f110 [Supplement.\nAddresses on Hypnotism.\ncalmly. Again, let us take such a disease as rheumatic fever. It might,\nperhaps, be thought that this was the very last disease to be benefited by\nsuggestion, and yet, when we come to think of it, we shall find that the\nnervous symptoms in it are very pronounced ; they are evidently produced\nby the toxins of the disease. Now, although we are powerless to touch the\nroot of the disease by suggestion, we may do much to alleviate symptoms ;\nby removing pain and mental distress, quieting restlessness, and securing\nsleep. We may even lower the temperature. This I have succeeded in\ndoing not only in rheumatic fever, but in pleurisy, pneumonia, and typhoid.\nNothing could more eloquently show the value of suggestive treatment in\ndiseases other than the purely nervous. I will instance just one other\norganic disease that can be benefited by this treatment\u2014tabes dorsalis\u2014a\nvery unlikely malady, one might think, to be improved by it. In a patient\nnow under observation I can always remove the girdle and lightning pains,\nand improve his appetite, spirits, and sleep. As the result of this treat\nment, he can now walk much more steadily than before, and considers\nhimself a great deal better than when he first came under observation. One\nword as to the necessity of sending the patient to sleep. This is, in my\nexperience, by no means essential. I have cured many cases without it ; we\nmay often succeed in getting the patient into a receptive condition by\nmaking him relax all his muscles to the utmost, and composing himself to\ncomplete mental and bodily inactivity. I do not agree with Mr. Myers that\nhypnotic phenomena cannot be explained on physiological lines. Mr.\nMyer3 would appear to assume that the subliminal processes to which he\nrefers are purely psychic. I contend that they must have a physiological\nbasis. Time does not permit me to say more than this concerning Mr.\nMyers's valuable and interesting remarks.\nV.\u2014Chas. A. Mercier, M.B., F.R.C.S. Eng.,\nLecturer on Neurology and Insanity, Westminster Hospital Medical School.\nSuggestion and Crime.\nI desire to point out that the cases of suggested crime instanced by Dr.\nBramwell are entirely beside the question. He has instanced cases in\nwhich it was suggested to a patient that the patient should commit a crime\nas a crime ; but this is not the point. The point is, and the fear is, that a\npatient may be made to commit a crime which has been suggested to him as\na purely innocent act. The common exhibition of the itinerant mesmerists\nis to make a patient eat a tallow candle on the suggestion that he is eating a\nstick of celery, or to drink soap and water under the suggestion that he is\ndrinking beer. Why, then, might not a butcher cut the throat of a child\nunder the suggestion that he is cutting the throat of a sheep 1 Why should\nhe not be made to poleaxe a man under the suggestion that he is poleaxing a\nbullock ? Or, to put a more probable and more practical case, why should\nnot a man be induced to sign an important document under the suggestion\nthat he was signing something of a totally different character, and of no\nimportance ?\n\fPart xxxiv.] Note on \"Fisher's Ghost.\" Ill\nII.\nNOTE ON \"FISHER'S GHOST.\"\nBy H. Arthur Smith.\nI think I am right in saying that in the general experience of psychical\ninvestigators, the more dramatic and interesting a ghost story is, the less\nlikelihood there is of its heing well authenticated. \" Fisher's Ghost \" is,\nhowever, certainly an exception to this rule. It has been as carefully\nexamined as any event so distant in time well can be, and this by enquirers\nwho have brought to the task special and varied qualifications. It is probably\nunique, in that it in some degree, at least, connects the question of ghostly\nphantasms with the severe principles of evidence which regulate the pro\nceedings of a Court of Law.1 Many years ago De Morgan, though he had\nprobably never heard of this case, conceived and considered the possibility\nof some such association. In his introduction to \" From Matter to Spirit,\"\nhe wrote : \"If the ghost of a murdered man were to make his appearance\nin court in a form which no one could possibly attribute either to imposture,\noptics, or chemistry, and were solemnly to declare that the prisoner was not\nthe murderer, and then to vanish through the roof, the judge would, no\ndoubt, instruct the jury that they must dismiss the respectable apparition\nfrom their minds altogether ; that even if the spirit had offered to be sworn\nand to stand cross-examination, there would be very grave doubt whether\nhis evidence could be received, from his probable want of belief in a future\nstate ; but that as matters stood, it was clearly their duty to take the vision\npro rum viso. To which the jury would reply, if they believed the ghost,\nby a verdict of not guilty.\" It is true that in Fisher's case the ghost\nwas considerate enough not to embarrass the court by any such entry as Mr.\nDe Morgan supposes, but it adopted a no less effective way of working its\nends, the difference being that in this case the ghost was on the side of the\nprosecution.\nThe story, which was investigated a year or two ago by Mr. Andrew\nLang, and fully related by him in Blackwood's Magazine for July, 1897, has\nquite recently been minutely examined from a lawyer's point of view by Mr.\nG. B. Barton, the official historian of New South Wales, who has of course\nhad special opportunities of testing it by reference to the records of the\ncolony. The bare facts, as now stated by Mr. Barton, may be very briefly\nsummarised.\nIn 1826, a ticket-of-leave holder, Frederick Fisher by name, was farming\na tract of land at Campbell-town, near Sydney, with the assistance of one\nGeorge Worrell, who acted as overseer, and was thoroughly conversant with\nall Fisher's concerns. On or about the 17th of June, Fisher suddenly\n1 Since writing this sentence I have observed that Mr. Andrew Lang, in the\npaper referred to below, gives some analogous cases from the English Courts.\n\f112 [Supplement.\nH. Arthur Smith.\ndisappeared, and in answer to enquiries as to what had become of him,\nWorrell gave it out that he had taken passage in the Lord St. Vincent and\ngone to England. Some of the neighbours were rather incredulous as to\nthis, inasmuch as nothing in Fisher's proceedings had pointed to any such\nsudden removal, and this incredulity was by no means decreased when it\nwas observed that Worrell was taking steps to sell off some of Fisher's\nhorses and farm stock. When asked for his authority for this procedure,\nWorrell produced a paper purporting to be a receipt signed by Fisher for\nthe purchase money of the horses ; but the signature was, to say the least,\ndoubtful, and the sale was not effected. Other features in Worrell's conduct\nfomented the suspicion that there had been some foul play in the business,\nand when three months had passed by without any news of Fisher, the\npolice authorities were moved to offer a reward of \u00a320 for the discovery of\nhis body, or of \u00a35 for proof that he had quitted the colony. This naturally\ndrew attention again to the case, and set many men to work, searching the\nbush in every direction ; but a month elapsed without any discovery. At\nlast, however, a settler named Farley created a sensation by alleging that\nwhen driving home at night from Campbell-town and passing the corner of a\npaddock that had belonged to Fisher, he suddenly saw the figure of a man,\nto all appearance Fisher himself, seated on the top of the fence. Taking\nit at first to be Fisher, he went up to speak to him, but as he approached, the\nfigure slowly rose from the fence, raised its right arm in the direction of a small\ncreek, and gradually disappeared, apparently followiug the windings of the\nchannel. This was at once reported to the police and the magistrates, who\neventually determined to have a search made on the spot. On the last day\nof October two constables, taking with them a native tracker named\nGilbert, proceeded to the spot. They at once found appearances as of blood\nstains on the fence indicated by Farley, and, with confidence increased by\nthis discovery, proceeded to the creek. On coming to a pool of water covered\nwith scum, Gilbert took a corn stalk from the neighbouring field, passed it\nover the scum, put it to his nose and said \" White man's fat.\" Then he led\nthem up the creek about 40 rods to some swampy ground, took the ramrod\nfrom his gun, drove it into the ground, drew it out, smelt it, and again said\n\"White man's fat, dig there.\" Spades were procured, and in a few minutes\nthe body of a man was discovered. The features were not recognisable, but\non getting one of the hands clear, constable Newland1 said \"That's the hand\nof Frederick Fisher; I will swear to it.\" He also recognised the body by\nits general appearance and by the clothes.\nOf course arrangements were at once made for an inquest. Medical\nevidence shewed that the skull had been fractured in several places. The\nidentification of the body as Fisher's was complete ; but though the suspicion\nagainst Worrell was keener than ever, the verdict was an open one\u2014 \" wilful\nmurder against some person or persons unknown.\" Worrell was, however,\narrested, and when before the magistrates made a declaration in which he\naccused four men who were in his kitchen on June 17th, as the guilty\npersons. This story, inconsistent as it was with his previous statements,\nmade little impression, and he was committed for trial at the Criminal\nSessions at Sydney.\n1 Mr. Lang gives this witness's name as Leonard.\n\fPart XXXIV.] 113\nNote on \"Fisher's Ghost.\"\nThe trial took place on February 2nd, 1827, before Chief Justice Forbes\nand a military jury of six officers, the prosecution being conducted by\nActing-Attorney-General Moore, and the defence by an attorney named\nRowe. Farley was not called as a witness, he having nothing to depose\nwhich the rules of evidence could admit. Worrell's conduct, however, was\nso unsatisfactorily explained that the jury had no difficulty in convicting.\nThe verdict was \"guilty \" and the death sentence pronounced.\nThe prisoner was attended by the Rev. W. Cowper, to whom he made a\nqualified confession, denying his declaration as to the four men whom he\nhad accused, but representing that he had accidentally struck and killed\nFisher while aiming a blow at a horse which he saw straying among the\nwheat crop. He was, however executed on a scaffold in front of the old gaol\noff Lower George Street in the presence of an enormous crowd.\nSuch, in outline, are the facts as narrated by Mr. Barton after examina\ntion of the court and official records ; and they agree in every important\npoint with the story as it was first told in R. Montgomery Martin's History\nof the British Colonies published in London in 1835 ; and a little later in\nTegg's Magazine published in Sydney, under the title of \" Fisher's Ghost,\na Legend of Campbell-Town.\" It appears also in Rusden's History of\nAustralia (1883) and with more or less intentional embellishment in House\nhold Words for 1859.\nA friend of my own who was Secretary of the Navigation and Pilotage\nBoards in Sydney in 1852, has recently given me his recollections of the story\nas it was told him by his father-in law, who was present at the trial and well\nconversant with the facts. His version again is in substantial agreement,\nbut there are certain variations of detail which it may not be uninteresting\nto indicate. In the first place his impression was that the locality of the\nmurder was near Parramatta, on the opposite side of Sydney from\nCampbell-town. In this he is doubtless wrong. Again in his version he\nrepresents Worrell as having despatched to England a letter addressed to\nhimself and signed in Fisher's name, in which letter Fisher is made to say\nthat, having come into a good fortune in England, he does not intend to\nreturn to Australia, and that for old acquaintance sake he makes Worrell a\npresent of the farm and stock. This letter was to be posted in England\nso as to confirm Worrell's alleged title. There is nothing in Mr. Barton's\nnarrative to contradict this, but obviously such a letter, if written, could\nhave had no effect whatever on the case, inasmuch as the interval between\nthe murder and the trial was not sufficient for it to have been despatched\nand returned. If it happened at all it could only have come to light\nafterwards. My friend's recollection is quite distinct as to the \" White\nman's fat', expression. In fact this is a point which would be little likely\nto escape any memory. The identification of the body he ascribes partly to\nthe peculiar \"basket\" pattern on the buttons, and partly to the discovery\nin the pockets of a large comprehensive sort of knife with corkscrew and\nother attachments, which Fisher was known to have recently received from\nEngland. My friend is under the impression that the prosecution was\nconducted by Mr. Alfred Stephen. This is not inconsistent with Mr.\nBarton's story, as Mr. Stephen must have been a young man at the time,\nand may well have held a junior brief with the Attorney-General.\n\f114 Note on a Case in \"Phantasms of the Living.\" [Supplement\nThe most important deviation, however, concerns the confession.\nAccording to his account, a petition for a reprieve was got up by some\npeople who were convinced of Worrell's innocence, and presented to Governor\nDarling ; and the Governor, strongly impressed with the peculiar circumstances\nwhich led up to the conviction, determining at the last moment to stay the\nexecution, despatched an orderly to the gaol for the purpose. Before his\narrival, however, Worrell had made and signed not a qualified but a complete\nconfession, giving details of the murderous assault which explained some of\nappearances on the spot. On this confession being at once reported to the\nGovernor, the reprieve was withdrawn and the execution proceeded with.\nOne can scarcely hesitate in choosing between this and the narrative given\nby Mr. Barton, whose sources of information are much more trustworthy.\nIt is just one of those dramatic embellishments which are likely to find their\nway in course of time into any story which has excited strong public\ninterest.\nOn the whole the various accounts of the event which have appeared are\nsingularly free from decorative additions, and though of couise there is room\nfor sceptical criticism as to the real origin of Farley's story, there is a\nvraisemblance therein which has been admitted by every narrator. One\nwould like to know whether Farley received the \u00a320 reward offered by the\npolice, for one cannot help suspecting that he may have known the details of\nthe murder from the beginning, and that on hearing of the reward he\ningeniously invented the ghost to explain the four months' delay in making\nthe disclosure. If so, being on the spot, he would have little difficulty in\nassisting the tracker to identify the locality of the grave. Mr. Lang\nconsiders this hypothesis, but rejects it as an improbable explanation of\nFarley's conduct. But is the apparition less improbable 1\nNOTE ON A CASE IN \"PHANTASMS OF THE LIVING.\"\nThe Editor of these Proceedings is of course not responsible for state\nments appearing in any other book ; but by the wish of the two surviving\npart-authors of Phantasms of the Living, and considering the close connection\nbetween that book and the S.P.R., under the auspices of whose Council it\nwas published, we think it right to mention here that one of the cases in the\n\" Additional Chapter,\" Vol. II., p. 671, must now be withdrawn. There is\nno reason to doubt the bona fides of Mr. Sparks, the principal informant :\nbut Mr. Cleave, then 18 years of age, whose evidence is essential to the case,\nhas admitted that the alleged apparition of himself, when entranced, to a\nyoung lady in London, was a hoax.\n\fPart XXXIV.] 115\nReviews.\nIII.\nREVIEWS.\nSome cases recorded in the \" Annales des Sciences Psychiques.\"\nProfessor Grasset published in the Annales des Sciences Psychiques for\nNov.-Dec., 1897, and in the Semaine Medicate of Dec. 1st, 1897, an account\nof an experiment made by him in Oct. 1897, with a subject of Dr. Ferroul's\nof Narbonne, in reading through opaque bodies. Reports of this experiment\nhave appeared in most of the chief English and American newspapers, and\nas these reports were in the main accurate it will be unnecessary here to\nenter into details. Suffice it to say that the subject read the contents of a\nsealed envelope sent by Professor Grasset to Dr. Ferroul with substantial\naccuracy, and Professor Grasset was satisfied that the envelope had not been\ntampered with in any way. Sufficient precautions had been taken to render\nit impossible to see the writing through the envelope, and the words written\nwere known only to Professor Grasset and not to Dr. Ferroul.\nI propose to comment on two points only in the record of this experiment,\nand then to give a brief account of a second experiment undertaken by a\nCommittee appointed by the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences et Lettres of Montpellier\nat the request of Professor Grasset.\n(1.) Dr. Ferroul writes to Professor Grasset as follows :\u2014\n\" When your packet arrived here this morning my subject was not at\nhand . . . Having to go my rounds I decided to arrange for my subject\nto come to my house about 4 o'clock, and I went to her house to make the\nappointment. Having learnt what I wanted she proposed to read the\ncontents of the envelope immediately.\"\nNow in view of the evidence of the committee of investigation which will\nbe given later, it would be of interest to know whether Dr. Ferroul proceeded\ndirectly to the subject's house 300 metres distant, after leaving the envelope\non his study table, or whether any considerable interval of time elapsed\u2014\nsay 20 minutes or half-an-hour\u2014before he went there ; and also whether the\nsubject was at home on Dr. Ferroul's arrival at her house.\n(2.) Professor Grasset opened the envelope before a meeting of the\nAcad\u00e9mie des Sciences et Lettres of Montpellier, and the members present\ndid not find any trace of the borders of the envelope having been tampered\nwith, after examining the inside of it.\nProfessor Richet has had the goodness to send two photographs of the\nenvelope, and another of the sheet of note paper which was enclosed in it.\nToo much importance must not be attached to criticisms founded on a\nphotograph, the opinion of the members of the Academy who saw the\noriginal being naturally entitled to more weight. But with this proviso,\nthe following observations may be of some value.\nA safety pin which had been inserted in the envelope, and which\nProfessor Grasset himself states had only caught some silver paper wrapped\nI 2\n\f116 [Supplement.\nJ. 0. Smith.\nround the document, did not pierce the document itself, so that if the\nenvelope had been opened, the document could have been removed without\ncausing a tear.\nThe appearance of the inside of the envelope strongly suggests that the\nflap most remote from the safety pin was loosened (by steaming or some\nsimilar method) and withdrawn from under the seal and afterwards replaced.\nThere are three separate indications of this at least.\n(o) A torn hole in that flap of the envelope through which the greater\npart of the safety pin ran.\n(6) A considerable tear in the (supposed) removed flap.\n(c) A crumpled margin of one of the side flaps, perhaps caused by\ndragging on replacement.\nAlso the margins of two of the flaps have darkened aspects, which some\nwhat suggests that fresh gum may have been used to keep the removed flap\nin place. The supposed removed flap also looks as if it might be dirtier, and\nthere appear to be indications that fresh gum has diffused itself beyond the\nedges where two of the flaps join.\nSo much for the first experiment.\nThe report of the committee appointed by the Academie des Sciences et\nLettres of Montpellier, appeared in the Semabie Medicale, pp. 18-20, 1898,\nand in the January-February number of the Aunales des Sciences Psychiqiies,\n1898. It is admirably written, and with much detail, and is signed by all\nthe members of the Committee, including Professor Grasset himself. I\nattempt no more than to give the salient points. Three envelopes were\nprepared by the Committee before leaving Montpellier ; but as two only were\nused in the experiments we may dismiss the third from our minds. Most\nelaborate precautions were adopted in the matter of sealing, gumming and\nwrapping, and the documents placed inside the envelopes were so selected\nfrom many others that their contents were unknown to any of the Committee\nor in fact to anybody, a condition which is strongly criticised by Dr. Dariex\nin the Anntdes in his comments on the report. But it should be borne in\nmind that the subject claimed not the faculty of telepathy but of reading\nthrough opaque bodies. Arrived at Narbonne, the committee proceeded to\nDr. Ferroul's house. Contrary to their wish, Dr. Ferroul insisted that the\nfirst experiment at least should be made under the conditions already familiar\nto the subject ; namely, that the envelope should be placed on the writing\ntable in his study, and that no one should be present in the room, not even\nif concealed ; as the subject found the presence of any body in the room,\nwhere the envelope was, disconcerting. Prepared for some such difficulty,\nthe Committee had placed one of the envelopes in a box filled with shavings\nand wrapped in stout paper ; and the additional precaution had been taken\nof inserting a sensitive plate inside the envelope, so that if the envelope\nwere opened the plate would be affected by the exposure.\nThe box was placed on the writing table. Dr. Ferroul then proposed to\nseal and lock the door of his study. The Committee saw no use in sealing\nthe door, as they had no private seal with them : and on search being made\nfor the key it could not be found\u2014a significant fact. A start was then made\nfor the subject's house, which, although but 300 metres distant, it took 7 or\n8 minutes to reach. At the moment of their arrival the subject was out.\n\fPart XXXIV.) 117\nReviews.\nShe arrived about 3 minutes afterwards and was at once hypnotised by Dr.\nFerroul. No mention is made of any means having been taken to test the\ngenuineness of the trance.\nThe trance began about t.5. The subject almost at once stated that the\nbox contained shavings.\nAt 2.15 she was awakened.\nAt 2.25 her sister, who, though present on the arrival of the Committee\nat 2 o'clock, had left the house almost immediately, re-entered the room.\nAt 2.27 the subject was re-hypnotised, and at 2.35 stated that the box\nwas made of wood.\nAt 2.40 a servant who had gone out just as the Committee arrived,\nre-entered the house.\nDuring the next hour the subject, who was awakened and re-hypnotised\nseveral times, had ample opportunities of conversing with her sister away\nfrom the observation of the Committee.\nAbout 3.30 the sister left the house taking with her some paint brushes,\nsaying that she was going to do some photo-miniature work. A few moments\nbefore she had had in her hand a small bottle containing a transparent liquid\nof a yellowish tinge.\nAt 3.40 the subject, when in trance, described the contents of the box in\ndisconnected sentences. She mentioned black sealing-wax (correct), a large\npaper\u2014shavings\u2014glass (i.e. the sensitive plate)\u2014green paper ...\" the\nletter 'f\u2014I think\u2014an 'r' a 'g' or an '\u00a3'\u2014and something else\u2014I'm not\nsure if there aren't numbers\u2014then a ' 4 ', I think.\"\nThe document inside the envelope really bore the following inscription.\nAt the top, the letters \"adf\" on one line\u2014on the line below, the letters\n\"g r.\" At the bottom are placed the numbers 8, 7, 4, upside down.\nAt 3.50 the subject was awakened and wished to walk alone to Dr.\nFerroul's house. The Committee followed and entered the study at the\nsame time.\nImmediately on entering the room two members of the Committee in\ndependently noticed that the box was not in exactly the same position as it\nhad been left in, and that the seals on the top were no longer intact.\nThe subject tried to tear the envelope\u2014presumably with the purpose of\ndestroying all traces of injury to the seals etc., but the envelope was quickly\nrecovered, before she had time to do it more than a trifling injury, which\nwas carefully noted.\nAt 4.15 an experiment was made with the second envelope, which\nwas held all the time by one of the Committee. The subject made three\nabsolutely unsuccessful attempts to read the contents. The third attempt\nwas distinctly amusing as it opened with a repetition of the words written in\nProfessor Grasset's envelope\u2014\"The deep heavens reflect in stars our tears :\nthen they said to themselves as they wrote it\u2014What does it matter, since\nshe has read it at a distance once.\"\nThe real contents of the envelope were a Knave of Clubs with the word\n\"amour\" written on one side of it, and a plain white card with the number\n\"24\" in one corner, and these words: \"It is a square courtyard with\nnothing peculiar about it.\"\n\f118 [Supplement.\n0. Smith.\nThe young lady then had an attack of nerves, which brought the seance\nto an abrupt conclusion. Dr. Ferroul and the Bubject explained the failure\nby the sensitive plate which acted on the subject, who at such moments is\nstored with electricity, as an insulator.\nThe Committee conclude their report as follows :\u2014\n\" We made two experiments with Dr. Ferroul's subject.\nIn one, the envelope remained in the possession of one of us all the time,\nand the subject's answers were completely wide of the mark.\nIn the other, if the subject succeeded in indicating more or less correctly,\nthough not fully, the contents of the box, it is essential to a proper\nappreciation of the value of this experiment, to collate from the evidence\ngiven above with regard to the condition of the box and its contents the\nfollowing facts :\u2014\n(1) The box had to be left unwatched.\n(2) The subject was absent from her house at the moment of our arriving\nhere after having relinquished the box.\n(3) The details relating to the contents of the box were furnished only\nafter an interval of 1 hour 40 minutes, and after the subject had communi\ncated several times with her sister, to whose frequent comings and goings we\nhave already drawn attention.\nThis summary will enable anyone to draw his own inferences and to find\nan explanation both simple and natural of the more than surprising keenness\nof vision of the subject whom we examined in deference to the request of\nthe Academy.\"\nI need only add that the seals on one side of the box were impaired, the\npaper-cover of the box was torn and had holes in it, and fresh gum had\nbeen used to refasten it, one of the seals had been bodily removed and stuck\nback again, and the sensitive plate showed unmistakably signs of having\nbeen exposed to the light.\nDr. Dariex, the editor of the Annate*, pleads for a suspense of judgment\non various grounds, chiefly on the ground that Professor Grasset's first\nexperiment remains unaffected by the evidence of the committee. It would\nbe hard, however, to believe that anyone will be found inclined to waste time\non further experiments with Dr. Ferroul's subject of the \"X rays eyes,\" as\nthe New York Herald called her, at least on experiments of this nature,\nthough if the evidence of some other experiments made with her in 1894\ncan be relied upon, there is reason to suppose that she is not always\nfraudulent, but occasionally clairvoyante. (v. Annates, May-June, Jnly-\nAngust, 1896.)\nI now proceed to consider two articles on table-turning phenomena by\nM. Rouillon, Professor of German at PeVigueux College, which appeared in\nthe Annates des Sciences Psychiqnes for Sept. -Oct., 1897, and Jan. -Feb., 1898,\nrespectively. I give the s\u00e9ances in their chronological order, thus slightly\naltering M. Rouillon's arrangement, and I discuss only those sittings at\nwhich two gentlemen, MM. Etienne Vidal and Loze, were present, either\nalone or with others.\nS\u00e9ance on the 28th November, 1893, in M. Loze's room at Limoges\nCollege.\n\fPart XXXIV.) 119\nReviews.\nTranslation.\n\"Seated at the table, MM. Vidal pere\u2014Etienne and Marcel Vidal, his\nsons, Loze and Rouillon. We make a chain with our hands on the edge of\nthe table.\nAt the end of 35 minutes movements begin.\nI ask for the name [of the Saint] on the almanac under the date of the\n12th June. None of us know it, and the same remark applies to all our\nseances. The almanac is on a writing table at three paces from us, resting\nagainst the lamp (the only light in the room) and so serves us as a screen.\nThis almanac has six months on each side. When the question was put, the\nside containing the first six months of the year was turned towards the light\nof the lamp ; none of us can see it. The answer is ' Trinit\u00e9,' we proceed to\nverify, and this is found to be correct.\nI leave the circle. The other four keep one hand only on the table,\nwithout forming a chain.\nQuestion. ' The name under the date of the 2nd January.' Answer.\n' Basile.' Correct.\nQuestion. The name given for the 2nd September? Answer. 'Firmin.'\nI proceed to verify the answer. The month of September is on the side\nof the almanac placed in the shade. The answer is wrong, but M. Loze\nobserves that Firmin does come in the month of September, that the word\nis written in large characters, and that there is a 2 in the date [of S. Firmin],\nthe 25th. The almanac is put back in its place, with the second six months\ntowards the light.\nM. Vidal asks for the name under the date of the 5th December.\nAnswer. Sabas.\nThis name, absolutely unknown to any of us, strikes us all with astonish\nment, and we regard the result as negative, as simply a fortuitous combina\ntion of letters. A verification is made, and Sabas is given under the date\nin question.\nAt the conclusion of the seance, we all signed a record vouching for the\nreality of these occurrences.\"\nThe presence of the almanac in the room to my mind deprives the results\nobtained of all value, as it is practically impossible to decide with certainty\nwhat is or is not within the range of vision of five different persons,\nespecially as the 35 minutes' concentration of mind before the table began\nto move may well have produced hyperaesthesia in the visual organs of any\nor all of the experimenters. It would have seemed the obvious precaution\nnot to have had an almanac at all in the room. The answers could have\nbeen written down and verified afterwards. The remark that the almanac\nwas on a writing-table at \"three paces from us\" is very loose evidence, it\nbeing clear that the writing-table could not be equidistant from the five\ndifferent persons sitting at the table. Out of the four questions asked, the\nname of the questioner is given in two instances, once M. Bouillon, once\nM. Vidal, in the two remaining instances the name of the questioner is not\ngiven. This is a point of some importance. M. Rouillon does not state\nwhether these four dates were the only dates asked, and it is possible that\nhe has recorded the successes or partial successes only.\n\f120 [Supplement.\nJ. G. Smith.\nM. Bouillon does not say what position relatively to the almanac he took\nup after leaving the circle at the table ; nor does he say, except in one\ninstance, who verified the answer by referring to the almanac. The phrases\nemployed are \"nous verifions,\" \"on verifie,\" once \"je verifie,\" and in one\ninstance the verification is not expressly mentioned, but left to be inferred.\nAnd even when M. Rouillon says \" je verifie,\" it does not amount to much,\nfor the expression does not exclude the co-operation of the other experi\nmenters. M. Rouillon is looking to see if the almanac gives Firmin as the\nsaint for September 2nd. It does not ; whereupon M. Loze draws attention\nto the fact that S. Firmin's day does occur in the month of September,\nbut on the 25th, instead of on the 2nd. Now we gather from M. Rouillon's\nrepeated assertions that neither M. Loze nor any other person knew\nthe dates of the various Saints' days. It follows then that although M.\nRouillon is said to have verified the reference, still M. Loze or M. Vidal may\nhave been examining the almanac as well at the same time. Ho only ones\nmentions the act of replacing the almanac after verification, and then uses a\ncharmingly vague French expression \"on replace.\" Obviously the person\nwho handled the almanac would have an opportunity of consulting it either\nconsciously or sub-consciously, and would then perhaps choose the next or\nsome subsequent date for the table to answer. And even in those instances\nwhen one experimenter is stated to have replaced the almanac, and another\nexperimenter to have put the subsequent question, there is no reason against\nsupposing, for any evidence to the contrary, that the person who replaced\nthe almanac may not have suggested a date to the next or some subsequent\nquestioner.\nI now pass on to the second seance, held in M. Loze's room on October\n30th, 1893, two days later.\nTranslation.\n\" At the table, MM. Etienne Vidal, Loze, Martin, licentiate in mathe\nmatics and science, and tutor at Limoges College, and Duris, tutor.\nSame conditions as before, no one either in the room or at the table\nknew the names asked for. The following questions were put by M. Vidal,\nwho appears to have the greatest influence on the table.\nThe name for Jan. 14. Ansuvr. Hilaire. Correct.\nFeb. 21. \u201e Pepin.

This name\ndoes not occur on the almanac that we used, neither on the date named, nor\nat any other date. In the evening being in the bursar's office I consulted an\nalmanac hanging on the wall and found under the date of July 30th the name\n'Abdon.' The same thing has happened several times in the course of my\nexperiments with my two children alone. We have sometimes had to consult\n11 11\nli 11\ntl 11\nil 11\n11 11\n\fPart XXXIV.] 121\nReviews.\na dictionary to find the name indicated by the table (the name ' Cunegonde '\nfor instance) or another almanac (for the name ' Rose.') The name dictated\nby the table always corresponded perfectly with the date named by us.\"\nMy observations on the first seance apply equally to this second s\u00e9ance.\nThe conditions we are told were the same. Are we to understand that the\nalmanac was still three paces from the persons sitting at the table ? If so, it\nfollows that the table was in precisely the same position as two days before.\nThe errors of one day and in two instances of exactly one month do not seem\nto have struck M. Rouillon as suspicious. They can hardly fail to strike\nothers so. The fact that the name \"Abdou\" had to be sought for in\nanother almanac in the bursary, and other names in a dictionary, are also\naccepted by M. Rouillon without misgiving.\nIt will be noticed that other persons besides the actual experimenters\nwere present in the room.\nIt is difficult to accept M. Rouillon's assurance that the date, or at least\nthe approximate date, of Holy Innocents' day was unknown to any person\npresent, particularly in a Roman Catholic country. Five out of ten persons\nof education would be aware that Innocents' day falls soon after Christmas\nand before the beginning of January.\nAs in the two remaining seances at which MM. Vidal and Loze assisted\nno further experiments were made with the almanac, it is only fair to state\nnow that M. Rouillon had obtained similar successes with other persons at\nthe table, but the success was intermittent and except in the case of one\nseance, at which he and his ten year old daughter alone were present, the\nproportion of failures to successes is not given. In this latter seance, out of\n30 dates 24 saints were correctly named by the table ; but this seance was\nheld on January 3rd, 1894, and M. Rouillon had been engaged with his\ndaughters and others in these almanac experiments off and on ever since\nSeptember 1893. In three or four months he ought to have become an\nexpert in Saints' Days, and at the least he ought not to expect his readers to\nbelieve that the saints corresponding to the dates that were chosen were\nabsolutely unknown to him or others present in every instance after the\ngame had been played so often.\nI now pass on to the most remarkable of the series of table-turning\nseances, which is described as follows in Annates des Sciences Psychiques,\nJan-Febr, 1898, pp. 1-5.\nTranslation.\nA Case From Limoges. By M. Rouillon.\nAn account is here given, drawn from careful notes and circumstantial\nreminiscences, of two experiences, which, considering the excellent conditions\nunder which they took place, constitute a contribution of great value (as I\nventure to believe) to psychical research. The two experimenters have been\npersonally known to me for several years ; their sincerity and critical habit\nof mind offer an unimpeachable guarantee of their accuracy.\nIdentification of a name with a dead person unknown to the experimenters,\nobtained by direct writing.\nOn Christmas evening 1893 M. Loze, bursary clerk at Limoges College,\nhad invited his friend M. Etienne Vidal to come to his rooms to take a glass\n\f122 (Supplement.\nJ. G. Smith.\nof white wine. It was about 10 o'clock. There was a good wood fire\nburning in the grate, in front of which stood a small round table with a\nbottle and a plate upon it. M. Vidal had his forearm, and M. Loze his\nelbow, on the top of the small table. The conversation was in no way\nconnected with the subject of psychical experiments. All of a sudden M.\nVidal felt the table rise once, then twice, and so forcibly that there was\nonly just time to clear the tray. \" Hullo,\" said M. Vidal, \"one would think\nthe table wants to talk. Let's wait a minute.\" They placed their hands on\nthe table and asked,\n\" Who is there ? \" \" Demi-Siphon.\"\n\" Dead or alive ? \" ( \" Mort ou vivant ? \") \"Dead.\" (\"Morte.\")\n\" Ah, it's a woman then ! What were you ? \" \"Adancer.\"\n\"Where?\" \" Moulin Rouge.\"\n\" What did you die of ? \" \" An accident.\"\n\" What accident ?\" \" Rupture of the perinaeum\u2014in doing ' a split.' \"\n\" Will you provide an interesting seance for our benefit ? \"\nThereupon followed some extremely curious phenomena, but of a nature\nwhich cannot be recorded here ; and afterwards the table spelt out \" Slates.\"\nSome time before this M. Loze had procured two slates in thick wooden\nframes, which he had fixed together by means of two brass screws.1 The\nscrews were unfastened and the slates separated. M. Loze washed them with\na wet sponge and put them to dry by the fire in a good light. Then he went\nto look in a drawer for a piece of pencil, and placed it between the two slates.\nM. Vidal, after examining the slates again on both sides, in front of the\nlamp and in the presence of M. Loze, who made a simultaneous and equally\ncareful examination, laid them one against the other and screwed them\ntogether. They were then placed flat on the table away from all contact with\nthe experimenters' hands. The table seemed to rap impatiently. On being\nasked what it wanted, the reply came: \"Remove the lamp.\" M. Loze\ncarried the lamp into an alcove about two paces away, whence it still threw\nsome light, while at the same time the glow from the fire was fairly bright.\nIt would have been quite easy to read the time by a watch. All this time\nM. Loze did not lose the slates, which were resting on the table, from sight,\nnor did M. Vidal touch them.!\n\" Write something, and when the writing is finished, rap once.\"\nThe table remained motionless for a moment, then gave two raps\nsignifying, according to the usual code, \"No.\"\n' ' There is something not quite right ? \" \" Yes. \"\n\"What?\" \"Hands.\"\n\"Do you want our hands on the slates ? \" \" Yes.\"\nThis was done,3 and after a moment the table rapped once.\n' ' Is the writing finished ? \" \" Yes.\"\n1 These were stout screws, at least four centimetres long.\n2 This mutual supervision on the part of both experimenters was the method of\nprocedure adopted throughout.\n3 It must be understood that during these experiments the slates rested on the\ntable, and were held (maintcnues) by both experimenters simultaneously in an amply\ngood enough light Each time that they were opened, it was in a strong light and\nunder the closest supervision of both operators.

Vidal, extremely distinct tracings were discovered on one of them\nresembling figures of 8 interlaced. Encouraged by this result, M. Vidal,\nwithout rubbing anything out, screwed up the slates again, and put them\nback on the table.\nThe lamp was again removed, and a request was made for something\nmore definite. The table remained stationary, but the movement of the\npencil was heard, and one rap was given. By the light of the lamp M. Vidal\nunscrewed the slates and on one of them some characters were seen which at\nfirst sight seemed to have no meaning. On questioning the table it replied :\n\"reversed.\" M. Vidal thereupon made out an L, and then M. Laze a\nflourish, which he occasionally uses as a signature. With his eyes away from\nthe slate the latter took a sheet of thin paper, on which he traced in his\nordinary style the flourish in question ; and on placing it, with the back\nside towards himself, against the lamp, he stated that the strokes which he\nhad just made were practically identical with those on the slate.\nThe slate was held before a glass, and M. Loze's signature was perfectly\nrecognisable.\nWithout effacing anything the slates were again screwed together and the\ntable was requested to be good enough to write in the ordinary way. The\nnoise of the pencil was noticed, and one rap was made. The slates were\nopened by M. Loze, and on one of them was found written in most satis\nfactorily clear characters \"Demi-Siphon.\" The slates were closed again by\nM. Loze.\n\"By one single word, applicable strictly and solely to yourself, indicate\nthe kind of life that you led.\" The noise of the pencil was once more heard,\nand once more there was a rap. The slates were unscrewed, and on one of\nthem was found very legibly written the word \" Vadrouille.\" The writing\nwas remarkably clear and firm. 1\nSome more questions were put to the table, which all of a sudden came\nto a standstill, and did not budge again.\nNeither M. Vidal nor M. Loze had ever heard of Demi-Siphon, and they\nwere puzzled both by the name and the details connected with it, of which\nthey knew absolutely nothing.\nThe next day, when talking of their experience before several colleagues,\nthey learnt that a few days before, Le Temps had announced the death of a\ndancer at the Moulin Rouge who went by the nickname of Demi-Siphon.\nM. Vidal told me at the time that he did not know whether the cause of\ndeath (rupture of the perinaeum) as indicated by the table was correct. But\nI feel sure I remember that this point was corroborated by inquiries made at\nthe time. During the whole evening M. Vidal and M. Loze were alone in\nthe room where the seance took place, and also at the following sitting. By\nway of invitation to a fresh seance, the intelligent force was requested to be\nso good as to give a palpable manifestation.\n\" Cross.\" An explanation was asked for.\n1 It will be observed that in these various experiments MM. Vidal and Loze took\nit in turn to open and shut the slates, one opening and the other shutting, and vice\nversa on the next occasion, without affecting the result in any way. (Note by\nM. Vidal.)\n\f124 [Supplement.\nJ. 0. Smith.\n\" Wall,\"\u2014but nothing was to be seen.\nSome days later, about half-past seven in the evening, M. Vidal was alone\nin his room, which no one else could have entered.1 All of a sudden on\nturning round he saw on the glass a cross about 10 centimetres long, traced,\nas if by a finger, in ink. The ink was still wet. About three metres from\nthe glass, on a table, stood an inkpot containing ink identical with that\nin the drawing. Now M. Vidal had not left his room for half an hour, and\nsome ten minutes or so previously he had just completed his toilet in front of\nthe glass, in a strong light, before going to the theatre. It can be said then\nthat this cross was produced in his presence.\nAbout the same time M. Loze also had found several crosses in chalk in\nhis room, and in various other places, but in this latter case the conditions\nwere not sufficiently stringent (le manque de controle) to warrant us attaching\nthe same importance to it. Still it seems likely, after taking into considera\ntion all the circumstances, that these marks proceeded from the same cause\nas the cross in ink. I append the attestations of MM. Vidal and Loze, and\ncan only add that these incidents were related to me by the two witnesses\nthe very day after they took place (le lendemain meme de leur constatation)\nwith all the details as given above.\nM.

Vidal\nThis report of the various experiences related (slates and cross) is in\nstrict conformity with the truth.\nL. Loze.\nIn connection with this case Professor Charles Richet writes as follows\nin a letter addressed to Mr. F. VV. H. Myers.\n\" I draw your attention to the paper by M. Rouillon in the Annates its\nSciences Psychiqiies. The value of the experiences depends wholly on the\nworth and honourable character, and above all on the scientific abilities of\nthe witnesses. M. Vidal, who was one of the witnesses and probably the\nmedium, is a man of great intelligence. At the time of the experiences he\nwas only 20 years old. Since then he has passed his medical examinations\nwith great brilliancy, and is now a Doctor of Medicine. He worked for\nthree years in my laboratory, and I consider that he possesses a scientific\nmind of an high order. The strange thing is that he should have had these\nmediumistic experiences during 6 weeks, and then never again.\" M. Richet\nadds that he has no personal acquaintance with M. Loze.\nIt is much to be regretted that the report was not written by M. Vidal or\nby M. Loze, or by both in collaboration, as M. Rouillon's paper exhibits the\nusual deficiences of second-hand evidence. Regrettable also is the interval\n1 The rooms of M. Vidal's family are separated from the rest of the college by a\nglass partition. Access is gained by a door which, from the outside, can be opened\nonly by a latchkey. This dcor leads into a large lobby with rooms on either side.\nOne of these rooms is M. E. Vidal's.\n\fPart XXXIV.] 125\nReviews.\nof four years between the date of the seances and the publication of the report.\nThis interval of four years must detract substantially from the value and\nreliability of M. Rouillon's record. Mention is made of contemporaneous\nnotes, by the aid of which the report published in the Annates was written.\nBut although not directly admitted, it seems a fair inference that the report\nwas not written by M. Rouillon until quite recently. Nor did M. Rouillon\ndepend entirely upon written notes ; he speaks of \" des souvenirs precis.\"\nAfter a lapse of three or four years it is quite true that our memory of any\nevent may be precise, or distinct or circumstantial, however we prefer to\ntranslate the word ; in fact it not seldom happens that our recollections\nbecome more precise, even too precise, as time goes on ; but it does not\nfollow that because our recollections are distinct they are necessarily\naccurate. It would be interesting to know how far these contemporaneous\nnotes preserve a record of the conditions, and how far the information about\nthe conditions given in M. Rouillon's paper, incomplete though it is, has\nbeen drawn from the memory of the experimenters 3 or 4 years after the\noccurrences.\nM. Rouillon makes a point of the fact that prior to the first and sudden\nappearance of Demi-Siphon the conversation was in no way whatever\nconnected with matters psychical. But we know that both M. Vidal and\nM. Loze had been attending table-turning seances quite recently, and so it\nis not unfair to presuppose a state of mental expectancy. An accidental\nmovement of M. Vidal's forearm or of M. Loze's elbow, both of which are\nrecorded to have been resting on the table just before it began to move,\nmay well have supplied the necessary stimulus to start the table on its wild\ncareer.\nM. Loze had \" some time before \" procured two slates joined together by\nbrass screws, presumably for experimenting at some seance which he had in\nview. Note the strange coincidence. M. Loze has \"some time before\"\n(\"depuis qnelque temps\")\u2014a vague expression like many others used by M.\nRouillon\u2014provided himself with two slates and screwed them together with\nbrass screws. Then lo ! and behold an obliging spirit named Demi-Siphon\narrives in the most opportune manner and performs upon them.\nIt is a pity that M. Rouillon did not take the trouble to search the issues\nof Le Temps about Christmas 1893 to make quite certain whether the details\nthere given of Demi-Siphon's death were identical with those given by the\nslate, or whether the table supplied any information which did not appear\nin the newspaper.\nAlso it would be most desirable to know whether Le Temps alone among\nFrench newspapers contained a reference to the death of Demi-Siphon, and\nwhether MM. Vidal and Loze were in the habit of reading Le Temps, as\nwere evidently some of their colleagues. For it is quite conceivable that,\nthough the experimenters did not consciously acquire the information, it\nmay have been acquired subconsciously by either or both of them.\nOne would like to know too where exactly the screws were placed in the\nslates, what was the size of the piece of pencil, and what was the size of the\nslates ; especially the latter, because unless they were fairly large, the\ncommunications must have got a little mixed before the end of the seance,\nas we are told that nothing written on them was rubbed out.\n\f126 J. 0. Smith.\nWere the slates shown afterwards to any other persons, with the writing\nstill on them? Before the slate-writing began, the table, or rather the\ninfluence that controlled it, impatiently demanded the removal of the lamp,\nbut it is noticeable that, though the table insisted on the removal of the\nlamp at the first seance, yet one would infer that the material manifestation\nof the ink cross, which, by the way, could not be produced then and there\nat the second seance, occurred in a strong light, for the cross was on the\nglass before which M. Vidal had been dressing \" en pleine Inmiire.\"\nThe day after the first seance MM. Loze and Vidal spoke of their\nexperiences before several colleagues. One may naturally suppose then\nthat they spoke of the unexplained incident of the \" Cross \" \" Wall,\" which\noccurred at the second seance, before other persons also. If this was the\ncase, there arises a formidable suspicion of a practical joke. Neither the\nfact that M. Vidal did not see the cross on entering his room and when\noccupied with his toilet, nor that the ink was still wet, nor that the ink on\nthe wall and the ink in M. Vidal's ink-pot were identical, exclude such an\nexplanation ; and no capable practical joker would be baffled by so slight an\nobstacle as a door which could be opened from the outside only by a\nlatchkey.\nAnd be it noted in this connection that it was not the door of M. Etienne\nVidal's room that could only be opened by a latchkey, but merely the front\ndoor of the suite of rooms occupied by M. Vidal pere and his family.\nAgain, to assume, as M. Rouillon does, that, because M. Vidal only\nnoticed the ink cross after having been some time in his room, therefore the\ncross was actually inked on the wall in his presence, is to assume a very\ngreat deal too much.\nNote also that M. Vidal did not see the cross in process of being drawn,\nonly when completed.\nIt is difficult to understand whether the \" Vadrouille \" incident was\nrecorded simply because of the production of clear and distinct writing when\nthe slates were screwed together, or whether because the answer was\nconsidered particularly apposite to the question asked. If the latter, it may\nbe remarked that this term might have been applied to many dancers at the\nMoulin Rouge without much risk of its proving inappropriate.\nLastly Professor Richet excites our curiosity by fixing on M. Vidal as\n\" probably the medium,\" but, like the wise judge, does not give his reasons,\nwhich we should very much like to hear.\nI come now to the last seance of the series. It is remarkable for having\nproduced a communication very similar in style to the communication made\nby \"Demi-Siphon.\" I translate the account given in Atuiales des Sciences\nFsychuiues, Sept.-Oct., 1897, p. 261.\n\"The following seance was held about January 13th, 1894, in M. Loze,s\nroom at the College. I give below a passage from a letter that I addressed\nto Professor Charles Richet on January 21st, as it correctly records what\ntook place :\u2014\n' Monsieur le Docteur,\u2014Eight days ago we made some new experi\nments in psychic force. One startling incident remains in my mind, which\nafter several days' consideration I have decided to communicate to you.\nAt the table were MM. E. Vidal, Loze and myself.\n\fPart XXXIV.] 127\nReviews.\nWithout any preliminary question the table dictates :\nJeanne Eymery.\nAre you dead } Yes.\nWhere ? Barnab6.\nWhat did you die of 1 Murdered.\nBy whom 1 Husband.\nWhen ? January 10th, 1894.\nHas your husband been arrested ? Yes.\nWhere is he ? Perigueux.\nWe took the whole thing as a joke, merely astonished at the part played\nby the unconscious self with its faculty of inventing elaborate stories, and\nwe didn't even think of verifying these fantastic lucubrations.\nIn the evening, at supper, M. Vidal pere said to his son : ' Well, have\nyou seen anything ? ' M. Etienne Vidal replied with a laugh, ' Oh nothing.\nWe had a visit from a woman named Jeanne Eymery who was murdered by\nher husband, etc.'\nWhereupon Mme. Vidal exclaims, 'Why, it's in to-day's Petite Gironde.'\nAmazement of M. E. Vidal who, after ascertaining that this affair was\nrelated at length in the Petite Gironde, runs off to find M. Loze in order to\nacquaint him with this strange discovery.\nI send you the newspaper in question .\nYour first idea, Monsieur le Docteur, will certainly be that one of us had\nread or learned in some way or other the story so strangely communicated to\nus. This is not the case, and we append our three signatures at the end of\nthis letter in support of our unanimous assertion.'\n\"From inquiries that I made by letter of the schoolmaster at Trelissac, of\nwhich Barnabo is a suburb, and also of the secretary of the mayoralty of the\nparish where Jeanne Eymery was born, it appears that her only Christian\nnames were Marie and Francoise. But it may be observed that the husband's\nname was Jean Eymery and that the wife is often known by the name and\nChristian name of her husband. It is true that 'Jeanne' is not 'Jean,'\nbut perhaps we may have borrowed the letter E of the surname Eymery and\ntacked it on to the Christian name ' Jean.' This would give the pronuncia\ntion ' Jeanne,' though one letter would be wanting to complete the proper\nspelling of the word. Assuming this to have been the case, there would be\nno contradiction on any point between the facts communicated by the table\nand those given in the newspaper.\"\nAgain a most important detail in the evidence is omitted by M. Rouillon,\nfor as before he does not state who put the questions to the table. No\ndifficulty seems to have been felt at the time when the table rapped out\nthe name \" Jeanne.\" The question \" Are you dead 1\" \" Vous etes Morte V\n(feminine) follows pat. The attempted explanation of the confusion between\n' ' Jean \" and \" Jeanne \" strikes me as particularly feeble. I am afraid that\nthe unsympathetic sceptic would point out that the substitution of the name\n\"Jeanne\" for \" Marie Francoise \" was far more probably caused by a slip\nof the memory on the part of one of the experimenters, who had read the\naccount of the murder in the Petite Gironde and confused the names of the\nhusband and wife, or who had read a report in some other newspaper where\nthe murdered woman's name was incorrectly given as \"Jeanne.\" For we have\n\f128 [Supplement.\nFrank Podmore.\nno reason to suppose that the affair was reported only in the Petite Gironde.\nAnd surely a spirit who three days after death could make such admirably\nlucid communications would not be likely to fail in such a personal detail as\nits own Christian name. Does not the inquiry \"Has your husband been\narrested?\" look like a \" leading question \" ? It suggests the methods of a\ncounsel examining a well primed witness. Perhaps the parts of examining\ncounsel and witness in this case were played by the same person. Strange\ntoo that, the experimenters should have regarded what M. Rouillon seven\ndays afterwards in his letter to Professor Richet calls \"a striking incident,\"\nas a joke. Why, little more than a fortnight before, they had been treated\nto a communication from Demi-Siphon, the details of which had been verified\nby means of a paragraph in Le Temps. These two spirits, Demi-Siphon, late\nof the Moulin Rouge, and Jeanne Eymery, were reiilly most accommodating.\nWith a thoughtfulness, which I am sure Dr. Hodgson would like to see\nemulated by the spirits communicating through Mrs. Piper, they refrain from\ngiving any information which cannot be verified in a newspaper published\nthe same day or a day or two before. They evidently shrink from giving any\nreason for suspecting them of being \"lying spirits.\" Everything that they\nrap out on M. Loze,s table has already appeared in print, with the exception\nof the single word Vadrouille, and a conversation unsuitable for publication.\nWhat more can one say than that !\nYet there is one little point more in their favour.\nJeanne Eymery can communicate clearly and unconfusedly three days\nafter she is murdered, and Demi-Siphon also a very short time after her life\nof degraded excess had come to an end. The promptitude and precision of\nthese communications would seem to show that a table is a more easily\nmanipulated medium than a human organism.\nBut are we bound to balieve that these are really messages from another\nworld ? Well, M. Rouillon can find no other explanation that fits the facts ;\nfor, says he, \"suggestion or transmission of thought (in other words, tele\npathy), presupposes a knowledge in the mind of one or of several persons\npresent of the facts revealed by the subject.\" Now we are assured again\nand again that none of the persons present at these seances were cognisant\nof the facts revealed by Demi-Siphon and Jeanne Eymery.\nPossibly M. Loze could solve the mystery.\nJ. G. Sshth. ,\nThe Making of Religion. By Ankrew Lano, M.A., LL.D. (Longmans,\nGreen and Co., London, New York and Bombay, 1898, pp. 380.)\nThis volume is full of interest for students of our evidence. It may, in\nfact, be defined as an essay in applied Psychical Research. Mr. Lang's object\nthroughout the first half of the book is to compare primitive and savage\nbeliefs in various classes of marvels\u2014clairvoyance, possession, poltergeists,\nthe fire-ordeal, etc.\u2014with modern civilised testimony to the same effect,\nand to suggest a modification of current anthropological theories, in so far as\nthey assume the baselessness of these primitive beliefs. The noble savage,\nMr. Lang argues, is not such a fool as the anthropologists make out : he had\n\fIVrt XXXIV.] 129\nReviews.\nat least as good ground for believing in powers transcending the material\nuniverse as any modern Spiritualist. The present writer does not feel\ncompetent to criticise Mr. Lang's views as to tho origin and growth of\nreligious ideas, nor is it necessary here to consider them. Special training is\nno doubt required to enable one to appreciate the value of the evidence\noffered. To the layman, indeed, it looks as if in the vast field of anthropology\neach inquirer is free to select whatever facts best fit his views, and still\nleave enough for those who come after to confute him withal. But no doubt\nthere are rules of the game to be observed.\nIn support of his position, however, Mr. Lang quotes a good deal of\nmodern evidence for clairvoyance, \" opening the gates of distance \" and the\nlike. The most striking are the crystal visions of the lady whom he names\nMiss Angus, some account of which has already been given in a paper read\nbefore the Society last year. ,Mr. Lang met \"Miss Angus\" early in 1897,\nand received from her accounts of some curious hallucinatory experiences.\nMr. Lang then induced the lady to look into a glass ball, and she shortly\ndeveloped an extraordinary faculty of seeing visions of persons and places\nunknown to her, but known to or connected with those in her company at\nthe time. Here is one account of the kind given in Miss Angus's own words\n(pp. 97-98).\n\" II.\u2014One afternoon I was sitting beside a young lady whom I had never\nseen or heard of before. She asked if she might look into my crystal, and\nwhile she did so I happened to look over her shoulder and saw a ship tossing\non a very heavy choppy sea, although land was still visible in the dim\ndistance. That vanished, and as suddenly a little house appeared with five\nor six (I forget now the exact number I then counted) steps leading up to\nthe door. On the second step stood an old man reading a newspaper. In\nfront of the house was a field of thick stubbly grass where some lambs, I was\ngoing to say, but they were more like very small sheep . . . were\ngrazing.\n\" When the scene vanished the young lady told me I had vividly\ndescribed a spot in Shetland where she and her mother were soon to spend a\nfew weeks.\"\n[Mr. Lang adds]\u2014\"I heard this case from Miss Angus within a day or\ntwo of its occurrence, and it was then confirmed to me verbally by the other\nlady. She agam confirms it (December 21st, 1897). Both ladies had\nhitherto been perfect strangers to each other. The old man was the school\nmaster apparently. In her MS., Miss Angus writes 'Skye,' but at the\ntime both she and the other lady said Shetland (which I have restored). In\nShetland the sheep, like the ponies, are small.\"\nThe next case to be quoted is more striking, as being strictly ex\nperimental. Mr. Lang writes (p. 99) :\u2014\n\" The next case is attested by a civilian, a slight acquaintance of Miss\nAngus's, who now saw him for the second time only, but better known to\nher family.\n\"IV.\u2014On Thursday, March ? 1897, I was lunching with my friends\nthe Anguses, and during luncheon the conversation turned upon crystal\nballs. The subject arose owing to Miss Angus having just been presented\nwith a crystal ball by Mr. Andrew Lang. I asked her to let me see it, and\nK\n\f130 [Supplement.\nFrank Podmore.\nthen to try and see if she could conjure up a vision of any person of\nwhom I might think ... I fixed my mind upon a friend, a young\ntrooper in the [regiment named], as I thought his would be a striking and\npeculiar personality owing to his uniform and also because I felt sure that\nMiss Angus could not possibly know of his existence. I fixed my mind\nsteadily upon my friend and presently Miss Angus, who had already seen two\ncloudy visions of faces and people, called out, ' Now I see a man on a horse\nmost distinctly ; he is dressed most queerly and glitters all over\u2014why, it's\na soldier ! A soldier in uniform, but it's not an officer.' My excitement on\nhearing this was so great that I ceased to concentrate my attention upon the\nthought of my friend, and the vision faded away and could not afterwards be\nrecalled.\u2014December 2nd, 1897.\"\n\" The witness gives the name of the trooper whom he had befriended in\na severe illness. Miss Angus's own account follows : she had told me the\nstory in June, 1897.\n\" Shortly after I became the happy possessor of a ' crystal ' I managed\nto convert several very decided 'sceptics,' and I will here give a short\naccount of my experiences with two or three of them.\n\" One was with a Mr. , , who was so determined to baffle me, he said\nhe would think of a friend it would not be possible for me to describe !\n\" I had only met Mr. the day before, and knew almost nothing\nabout him or his personal friends.\n\"I took up the ball, which immediately became misty, and out of the\nmist gradually a crowd of people appeared, but too indistinctly for me to\nrecognise anyone, until suddenly a man on horseback came galloping along.\nI remember saying, ' I can't describe what he is like, but he is dressed in a\nvery queer way\u2014in something so bright that the sun shining on him quite\ndazzles me, and I cannot make him out ! ' As he came nearer, I exclaimed,\n'Why, it's a soldier in shining armour, but it is not an officer, only a soldier!'\nTwo friends who were in the room said Mr. 's excitement was intense,\nand my attention was drawn from the ball by hearing him call out, ' It's\nwonderful ! It's perfectly true I I was thinking of a young boy, a son of a\ncrofter, in whom I am deeply interested, and who is a trooper in the in\nLondon, which would account for the crowd of people round him in the\nstreet.' \"\nOne other case may be referred to, as illustrating the intrusion on a\nvision of the ordinary kind of an alien impression\u2014which, if due to thought-\ntransference, may have had its origin in the mind of a lady at a considerable\ndistance, through the mediation, it may be conjectured, of her mother, who\nwas present in the room with Miss Angus.\nMiss Angus, on February 2nd, 1897, was looking in the crystal and\ndescribing what she saw\u2014a man with an agreeable smile, whose appearance\nand surroundings were described with some detail and recognised by the\npersons who had set the test. \" The vision, which interested Miss Angus,\npassed away, and was interrupted by that of a hospital nurse, and of a lady\nin a peignoir, lying on a sofa, with bare feet.\" The vision was apparently\nnot recognised at the time ; but a few days later, a Mrs. Cockburn, who had\nbeen present, struck by the exact fulfilment of a later vision, wrote to her\nyoung married daughter, then some fifty miles away and much in her\n\fPart XXXIV.] 131\nReviews.\nthoughts, \"and asked whether on February 2nd, she had been lying on a\nsofa in her bedroom, with bare feet. The young lady confessed that it was\nindeed so ; and when she heard how the fact came to be known, expressed\nherself with some warmth on the abuse of glass balls, which tend to rob\nlife of its privacy.\" The incident, however, occurred between 4.30 and\n7.30 p.m., whilst the crystal vision was seen about 10 p.m.\nAs an alternative to the hypothesis of thought-transference from the\nyounger lady's mind, it may be suggested that the attitude was perhaps a\nnot unfamiliar one ; and that Mrs. Cockburn may have subconsciously\npictured her daughter as so placed at that time.\nIt is curious to note the effect produced on Mr. Lang by Mrs. Piper's\ntrance-revelations. This is how he refers to the most astonishing body of\ntestimony which has ever been published for supernormal faculty ; the only\ntestimony of the kind, indeed, in which every evidential flaw has been, as\nfar as possible, eliminated.\n\" In this treatise, I may have shown the ' will to believe ' in an unusual\ndegree ; but, for me, the interest of Mrs. Piper is purely anthropological.\nShe exhibits a survival or recrudescence of savage phenomena, real or\nfeigned, of convulsions and of secondary personality, and entertains a\nsurvival of the animistic explanation.\" But this sentence was written,\napparently, before the publication of Dr. Hodgson's last Report. Mr.\nLang, after that publication, adds the following:\u2014\"The published reports\ndo not produce on me any such impression [i.e., as they have produced on\nDr. Hodgson]. As a personal matter of opinion, I am convinced that those\nwhom I have honoured in this life would no more avail themselves of Mrs.\nPiper's ' entranced organism ' (if they had the chance) than I would\nvoluntarily find myself in a sitting with the lady.\" All which means, I take\nit, that Mr. Lang does not like Mrs. Piper.\nMrs. Piper, no doubt, makes\u2014or used to make\u2014ugly faces in going into\nthe trance: and her \"spirits\" use various Americanisms, and say \"Sir\"\nto each other and the sitter with irritating frequency. But setting aside\nsuch aesthetic considerations (which can hardly be supposed to affect a\ncritical estimate of the case) I can suggest but one explanation for what\nseems a curiously inadequate appreciation on Mr. Lang's part of evidence\nvaluable not less for his purposes than for ours. Mrs. Piper's trance\nutterances are presented in all their original crudity, with repetitions, in-\ncoherencies, loose tags, and irrelevant\u2014or seemingly irrelevant\u2014digressions\nand interpolations. As such they form a striking contrast to the smooth\nand finished narratives with which Mr. Lang has so often delighted himself\nand us\u2014witness, The Book of Dreams and Ghosts.\nThe difference, of course, is the difference between the elaborate\nantiquities which are the produce of Birmingham or Soho, and the battered\nand wormeaten fragments with which the genuine amateur has often to be\ncontent. Mr. Lang, if the figure is allowable, likes his psychical bric-a-brac\n\"restored\" and decorated.\nMr. Lang is very happy in his treatment of Herr Parish, one of the\nmost recent critics of our evidence. There is no doubt that Parish,\nthough more candid and more painstaking than most persons who have\nundertaken to demolish the evidence for telepathy, has made several\nK 2\n\f132 [Supplement.\nFrank Podmore.\nblunders, has fallen into many singular misconceptions, and has committed\nhimself to some untenable positions. Mr. Lang deftly criticises the critic,\nand illustrates from Herr Parish's own argument the various sources of\nerror\u2014want of attention, inaccuracy, fallacious memory and all the rest of\nthem\u2014with which Parish charges our witnesses. Here for instance is an\nexample :\u2014\n\" A lady, facing an old sideboard, saw a friend with no coat on, and in a\nwaistcoat with a back of shiny material. Within an hour she was taken to\nwhere her friend lay dying, without a coat, and in a waistcoat with a shiny\nback. Here is the scientific explanation of Herr Parish :\u2014' The shimmer\nof a reflecting surface [the sideboard ?] formed the occasion for the\nhallucinatory emergence of a subconsciously perceived shim\/ black roaist-coat\n[cpiotation incorrect, of course], and an individual subconsciously associated\nwith that impression.' I ask any lady whether she consciously or subcon\nsciously associates the men she knowB with the backs of their waistcoats.\nHerr Parish's would be a brilliantly satisfactory explanation if it were only\ntrue to the printed words that lay under his eyes when he wrote. There\nwas no ' shiny black waistcoat,' but a waistcoat with a shiny back. Gentle\nmen, and especially old gentlemen who go about in bath-chairs (like the man\nin this story), don't habitually take off their coats and show the backs of\ntheir waistcoats to ladies of nineteen in England. And, if Herr Parish had\ncared to read his case, he would have found it expressly stated that the lady\n' had never seen the man without his coat ' (and so could not associate him\nwith an impression of a shiny back to his waistcoat) till after the hallucina\ntion, when she saw him coatless on his deathbed. In this instance, Herr\nParish had a hallucinatory memory, all wrong, of the page under his eyes.\nThe case is got rid of then by aid of the ' fanciful addenda ' to which Herr\nParish justly objects. He first gives the facts incorrectly, and then\nexplains an occurrence which, as reported by him, did not occur, and was\nnot asserted to occur.\n\"I confess that, if Herr Parish's version were as correct as it is\nessentially inaccurate, his explanation would leave mo doubtful. For the\ncircumstances were that the old gentleman of the story lunched daily\nwith the young lady's mother. Suppose that she was familiar (which\nshe was not) with the shiny back of his waistcoat, still, she saw him\ndaily ; and daily, too, was in the way of seeing the (hypothetically) shiny\nsurface of the sideboard. That being the case, she had, every day, the\nmaterials, subjective and objective, of the hallucination. Yet it only\noccurred once, and then it precisely coincided with the death agony of the\nold gentleman, and with his coatless condition. Why only that once ?\nCest la le miracle .' ' How much for this little veskit ? ' as the man asked\nDavid Copperfield.\"\nIt is delightful to have the tables turned in this fashion. There is space\nfor but one more quotation. Parish, following Professor Royce, argues that\nmany cases of so-called fulfilled presentiments are really due to hallucination\nof memory, started by the news of some sudden and painful event ; ignoring,\nor making light of, the fact that many of these \"pseudo-presentiments\"\u2014\nas he styles them\u2014are attested by a second witness, to whom the vision was\ntold before the news came.\n\fPart XXXIV.] 133\nReviews.\nThis is Mr. Lang's humorous presentation of our critic's argument :\u2014\n\" Jones tells me that he has just seen his aunt, whom he knows to be in\nTimbuctoo. News comes that the lady died when Jones beheld her in his\nsmoking-room. 'Oh, nonsense,' Herr Parish would argue, 'you, Jones,\nsaw nothing of the kind, nor did you tell Mr. Lang, who, I am sorry to find,\nagrees with you. What happened was thi\u00bb: When the awful news came\nto-day of your aunt's death, you were naturally, and even creditably, excited,\nespecially as the poor lady was killed by being pegged down on an ant-heap.\nThis excitement, rather praiseworthy than otherwise, made you believe you\nhad seen your aunt, and believe you had told Mr. Ling. He also is a most\nexcitable person, though I admit he never saw your dear aunt in his life.\nHe, therefore (by virtue of his excitement), now believes you told him about\nseeing your unhappy kinswoman. This kind of false memory is very\ncommon. Two cases are recorded by Kraepelin, among the insane. Sure\nyou understand my reasoning ? '\n\"I quite understand it, but I don't see how it comes to seem good logic\nto Herr Parish.\n\"The other theory is funnier still. Jones never had a hallucination\nbefore. ' The rarity and the degree of interest compelled by it ' made Jones\n' connect it with some other prominent event,' say the death of his aunt,\nwhich really occurred, say, nine months afterwards.\"\nNaturally, Mr. Lang appears to me less convincing when he turns to\ncriticise my own views on Poltergeists. I submit, indeed, with some diffi\ndence\u2014a diffidence not lessened by the suspicion that to Herr Parish,\nperhaps, his own case may present itself in a similar light\u2014that Mr. Laug\nhas not fairly represented my argument. Briefly, that argument is as\nfollows : I took all the cases of mysterious stone-throwing, etc., which the\nSociety during its existence, i.e., from 1882 onwards, has investigated at or\nshortly after the time of their occurrence. Naturally, these eleven cases,\nselected for investigation out of a much larger number reported in the news\npapers during the last fifteen years, were selected because they were primd\nfacie good cases\u2014that is, good for the supernormal interpretation which Mr.\nLang here champions.\nNow, until I carefully collated these eleven cases, I held it not im\nprobable that there was something inexplicable in these Poltergeist\nmanifestations. I expressed that opinion, indeed, in my report on the first\ncase which I personally investigated in 1883. That I now hold the contrary\nopinion is not because I find the intervention of a new physical force ante\ncedently incredible. It is solely a question of evidence. I cannot find any\nevidence that would justify such a supposition, even as a working hypothesis.\nThere are, broadly, two qualities which wo demand in evidence for the\noperation of a new cause. It must be good as evidence, that is, it must be\nrecent, and must proceed from witnesses of good intelligence and character ;\nand it must be demonstrative, that is, the things attested must be of such\na kind that no other interpretation is possible. Now, by a careful analysis\nof these eleven selected cases, and of others gathered from various sources,\nI endeavoured to show that these two qualities in the evidence are never\nfound together. There is much testimony that is credible, but inconclusive,\nas where, to quote a case investigated by Colonel Taylor, the new servant's\n\f134 [Supplement.\nFrank Podmore.\nbest hat is reported by her mistress, a respectable householder, to have been\nfound in the water jug, and a pair of stockings were revealed in the kitchen\nboiler.1 And again, there is much that would be conclusive, if its remote\nness, the defect of education on the part of the witness, or other circum\nstances, did not lessen its credibility ; as where, to take another illustration\nfrom a case investigated by Colonel Taylor, a rustic is reported two or\nthree weeks after the event to have seen a shadowy hand upset a tray of\npotatoes.2\nMy argument then proceeded to infer that since over so wide a field\nthe qualities of conclusiveness and credibility were never found combined,\nthis characteristic of the evidence was probably not accidental, that the\nevidence which was credible was for that reason necessarily inconclusive ;\nand that, when the evidence seemed demonstrative, its conclusive quality\nwas due to the circumstances which lessened its credibility.\nThis argument was strengthened by the demonstration of trickery in some\ncases, of strong grounds for suspecting trickery in others ; and, generally,\nof errors, discrepancies, and sources of weakness in all the testimony\navailable. Mr. Lang meets my argument by taking one case and analysing\nit. The case which he selects is the case which I reported upon in 1883\u2014the\nfirst case investigated by any representative of the Society. Let me at once\nadmit that Mr. Lang points out one or two flaws\u2014one of considerable\nimportance\u2014in my treatment of this case. The evidence of the Worksop\ndisturbances does not altogether, as erroneously stated, rest on reports\nmade several weeks after the events. Mr. Lang has done what I ought to\nhave done, and has compared the version of the events given to me by one\nof the principal witnesses on April 10th, with an earlier account by the\nsame witness, published in the local papers on March 9th. These two\naccounts are in almost complete agreement. And this disposes of my\nstatement as regards this witness, at any rate, that the testimony to the\nmarvels must be discounted in view of the long interval which elapsed\nbetween the events and their record. Mr. Lang is also clearly justified in\npointing out that in my original report (of 1883) I ought to have quoted the\nevidence for certain statements made as regards the servant gill concerned\nand her mother. In fact, they were based, if I remember right, on common\n\u2014and possibly inaccurate\u2014report.\nFor the rest, Mr. Lang devotes several pages to shewing that the\ndescriptions given by the various witnesses, and even my own report (of\n1883) are inconsistent with the hypothesis of trickery. In all this he does\nme the honour to reinforce my own argument. The various witnesses are\ndoubtless honest and intelligent ; and the things which they say they have\nseen cannot be accounted for by trickery. That was the impression pro\nduced on me by the reports in 1883 ; it is the impression produced on me\nstill ; and it is interesting to note that such is also the impression produced\non so acute a critic as Mr. Lang.\nBut beyond this point our views diverge. To charge Mr. Lang\u2014the\nchampion of our English tongue against all irreverent assailants\u2014with\n1 S.P.R. Proceedings, Vol. XII., p. 86.\n2 S.P.R. Proceedings, Vol. XII., p. 71.\n\fPart XXXrV.] 135\nRevieius.\nmisunderstanding an English sentence savours of impertinence, almost of\nimpiety\u2014as if a schoolboy should accuse his headmaster of a false quantity.\nAnd yet: I wrote, of the Worksop case, \"The phenomena described are quite\ninexplicable by ordinary mechanical means.\" Mr. Lang quotes this sentence\n(p. 357) and a few lines lower down, twice over, converts it into \"Yet a\nhalf-witted girl, in Mr. Podmore's theory, can do what is quite inexplicable\nby ordinary mechanical means.\" But I did not say the things done were\ninexplicable ; I said the phenomena described were inexplicable ; and I meant\nwhat I said and no more. It is hardly necessary to point out that the\ndifference is something more than a mere verbal nicety. -It is of the very\nessence of the argument which Mr. Lang does me the honour to criticise. My\ncontention is that things described are by no means the same as things done.\nMr. Lang's view apparently is that they are. And so a page or two further on\nhe introduces a highly decorated piece of bric-a-brac\u2014Mr. Bristow's account\nof the Swanland disturbances. The disturbances took place in 1849, when\nMr. Bristow was a joiner's apprentice. In 1854 he made some rough notes\nof the occurrence ; in 1891 he expanded those rough notes into the account\nprinted in our Proceedings.1 This account, as already said, is highly\ndecorated. Mr. Lang introduces it as follows : \"The most curious modern\ncase known to me is not of recent date, but it occurred in full daylight, in\nthe presence of many witnesses, and the phenomena continued for weeks.\"\nMr. Lang finds this case interesting, notwithstanding that unlucky interval\nof five years ; to me it seems probable that the interest which the case\npossesses for Mr. Lang is due mainly to the interval. If those \" moving\nodds and ends of wood \" had been watched by Mr. Westlake, say, instead of\nby Mr. Bristow : or, if the account had been written down in full the next\nday, instead of in brief five years afterwards, it may be suggested that the\nnarrative would hardly have possessed sufficient interest to tempt Mr. Lang\nto quote it.\nFor myself, I am grieved to think that the Poltergeist should go. He was\na more picturesque figure than the naughty little girl who takes his place.\nThere are too many naughty little girls on this planet already.\nMr. Lang next criticises my suggestion\u2014often, of course, made before\u2014\nthat in certain cases the witnesses to alleged \"physical phenomena\" may\nhave been hallucinated. In two instances, indeed, owing it is likely to a\nwant of clearness of expression on my part, Mr. Lang hits misunderstood me.\nThus he quotes the account given by the Master of Lindsay of Home's\nlevitation, which was briefly to this effect : that the witnesses\u2014Lord Lindsay,\nLord Adare and Captain Wynne\u2014heard the window in the next room lifted\nup ; that Home was carried out of the window, and in at the window of the\nroom in which they were sitting ; that Lord Adare then went into the next\nroom, to look at the window, and \"expressed his wonder how Mr. Home\nhad been taken through so narrow an aperture. Home said, still entranced,\n'I will show you,' and then, with his back to the window, he leaned back,\nand was shot out of the aperture, head first, with the body rigid, and then\nreturned quite quietly.\"\nIn arguing for the hypothesis of collective hallucination, built up on\na nucleus of physical fact supplied by the medium, I suggested, as an\ni Vol. VII., pp. 384-394.\n\f136 (Supplement.\nFrank Podmore.\nillustration of my meaning, that Home on this occasion, \" at least thrust his\nhead and shoulders out of the window.\"1 Mr. Lang quotes this sentence\nand rejoins, \"But if he did, they could not see him do it, for he was in\nthe next room. A brick wall was between him and them.\" But as they\ndidn't see him do it, and only inferred it from a noise, which again they\ninferred to come from the opening of the window in the next room, it is\nclear that the suggested explanation, so far as regards that part of the\nlierformance, is superfluous. As a matter of fact, of course, the suggested\nexplanation was intended, not for the first \"levitation\"\u2014which as having\nbeen led up to and introduced by Home at a time and under conditions of\nhis own choosing, can scarcely, I submit, be claimed as a strong case even by\nthose who are convinced that such levitation does occur\u2014but for the second,\nwhich was of the nature of a direct experiment.\nSo again with the fire-test ; as performed by Home I should suppose\u2014still\non the theory of hallucination\u2014that the manifestation was generally worked\nby the substitution, aided by a subdued light, of a cold cinder for a hot one ;\nand that ho \" possibly on some occasions (as when the hot coal produced a\nblister on the hand of Mr. Lang's friend) held the live coal in his hand,\nprotected by some non-conducting substance.2\" Mr. Lang, on the authority\nof Sir W, Crookes, tells me that there is no substance known which can\nprotect the skin from the effects of great heat, and challenges me to produce\nmy non-conducting substance. Well, I was thinking of nothing more\nrecondite than a piece of asbestos cloth.\nMr. Lang does not find the theory of collective hallucination a satisfactory\nexplanation of the alleged physical phenomena commonly called Spiritual\nistic. Nor do I. But I- prefer it, as regards the cases just quoted, to any\nother hitherto advanced. If I may venture, indeed, to interpret Mr. Lang's\nposition, he is arguing not so much in favour of explanation by supernormal\nforces, as against an indolent acquiescence in the explanation by hallucina\ntion. Of those alleged physical phenomena, the greater part, Mr. Lang\nwould no doubt agree, are due to trickery pure and simple. But there are\nsome recorded cases in which the explanation by trickery pure and simple\nwould amount almost to an outrage on common sense. Mr. Lang and I\nshould possibly differ pretty widely as to the size of this residuum. But we\nare both agreed that some of the manifestations in Home's presence recorded\nby Sir W. Crookes and others fall within it. Now, on the assumption that\ntrickery is inadequate in these cases, we have the choice, broadly speaking,\nof two other explanations : (1) that the things really happened\u2014say that\nHome really took a live coal out of the fire in his naked hand and was not\nburnt ; (2) that Home did not take up a live coal in his naked hand, but\nthat, partly by exercise of the ordinary conjurer's art, partly by the aid of\nsuch verbal suggestion as is employed by the hypnotist, he succeeded in\ninducing in Sir W. Crookes' mind, at the moment or subsequently, the belief\nthat he had done so. Let us admit that whilst neither explanation is\nimpossible, both go beyond common experience. But the first is without\n1 Studhs in P$>ichical Jtcsearch, p. 121.\n- Op tit., p. 121.\n\fPart XXXIV.] 137\nRevietvs.\nparallel or analogy of any kind, and involves the assumption, so far\nas we can at present see, of an entirely new physical law ; the other\ninvolves merely tho intrusion into a new region of tolerably familiar\nmental processes. It is perfectly true, of course, that whilst we know of\nsense-deceptions of many kinds, and occurring under various conditions\nto various subjects, we know of no other case in which a Fellow of the\nRoyal Society has been hallucinated in the course of a scientific experi\nment. But then other Fellows of the Royal Society\u2014more's the pity\u2014\nhave not had the courage or the curiosity to place themselves under the\nsame conditions.\nMr. Lang raises two special objections to the theory of collective hallu\ncination ; first that all the witnesses, as in the levitation case, are affected in\nthe same way (p. 362). But if the hallucinations are suggested by the word\nor gesture of the performer, we should expect them, as at a hypnotic seance,\nto be uniform. We should marvel rather if like causes did not produce like\neffects. And again, \"contagious hallucination cannot affect witnesses\nignorant of each other's existence in many lands and ages, nor could they\ncook their reports to suit reports of which they had never heard \" (p. 361).\nNo doubt the uniformity of testimony to these occurrences indicates a\nuniform cause. But a uniformity of mental constitution in the human\nrace predisposing to similar tricks or similar delusions, will fit the facts just\nas well as a hypothetical mode of physical energy. And we have some\nevidence for the one view, and none for the other. In brief, since we\nhave to make some assumption\u2014for merely to admit that these phenomena\nare of interest is to uphold a theory about them, viz., that they are\nnot yet explained by trickery,\u2014it seems clear that, other things being\nequal, we should make, as tentatively and undogmatically as we please,\nthe assumption that involves the least departure from the established\norder.\nBut other things are by no means equal ; there are two special con\nsiderations which point very strongly towards hallucination rather than\n\" ectenic \" force. The first is the extreme diversity of the effects reported\n\u2014the levitation of the human body, the handling of red hot substances, the\napports of Howers through closed doors, the \" materialisation \" of objects,\nthe production of musical sounds, the lengthening of the human body, etc.\nEach new kind of manifestation increases the difficulty of the physical\nhypothesis. It is apparent, if all\u2014or several\u2014of these alleged phenomena\nreally occurred, that we have to deal either with several new forces, or with\none force altogether remote from familiar analogies. An \"ectenic \" or psychic\nforce wielded by the medium's automatic consciousness can only appear\nan easier hypothesis than that of the Spiritualists because some of the\nphenomena are ignored, and some of the difficulties evaded. Unless, indeed,\nadopting a suggestion made by Mr. Myers, we are willing to credit the\nautomatic consciousness of the medium with the power of dealing, like\nClerk Maxwell's demon, with molecular forces. If Home could handle\nmolecules with as much ease as the rest of us can play at marbles, no doubt\nhe could perform all the marvels reported of him. But that is a larger\nassumption than the champions of \"ectenic\" force have hitherto shown\nthemselves willing to make. The second set of considerations is, to my\n\f138 [Supplement.\nFrank Podmore.\nthinking, even more decisive. Sir W. Crookes, at the beginning of his own\ninvestigation, indicated very clearly the rules to which proof of the alleged\nnew physical forces should conform. The Spiritualists, he says, tell us of\nflowers and fruit and Mrs. Guppy being carried through closed doors and\nbrick walls. \"The scientific investigator naturally asks that an additional\nweight (if it be only the 1,000th part of a grain) be deposited on one pan of\nhis balance when the case is locked, and the chemist asks for that 1,000th\nof a grain of arsenic to be carried through the sides of a glass tube in which\npure water is hermetically sealed.\"\nIn other words, the phenomena should be performed under strict ex\nperimental conditions. The proof of the thing done should depend upon\nsomething else than the mere observation of the experimenter, however\nskilled. There should be a permanent automatic record. Now when Sir\nW. Crookes wrote the words above quoted\u2014more than 25 years ago\u2014the\nabsence of any evidence of this kind, though a serious defect, was scarcely\nin itself suspicious. These alleged phenomena had for the most part up to\nthat time been investigated by persons without any scientific training, who\nwere not aware of the kind of proof required. The spirits, or the \"ectenic\"\nforce, could not have failed to meet tests which had never been demanded.\nBut in the 25 years which have passed since then, not only Sir W. Crookes\nhimself, but many other trained and capable investigators have examined the\nsubject, have witnessed the phenomena, have, on occasion, propounded tests\nof the exact kind indicated. And yet the evidence stands now exactly where\nit stood when the words were written ; but with a difference. There are\nplenty of competent persons who have seen things which neither they nor\nwe can explain ; but no one can yet point to the fulfilment of the simple\ntest proposed. Many eminent persons can vouch for movements or altera\ntions in the weight of heavy bodies\u2014but the balance in its locked glass case\nremains unaffected ; flowers and fruit and Parian statuettes have continued\nto make their appearance in closed rooms\u2014but that small particle of arsenic\nhas not yet found its way through the walls of the hermetically sealed tube.\nIntense cold has been felt at a seance ; but has never been recorded by a\nself-registering thermometer. Strange draperies, delicious scents, solid\nluminous bodies, even material human forms, have been produced out of the\nviewless air ; and into the viewless air have returned unweighed, unanalysed,\nand rarely photographed.\nNow, whether these tests have been applied and evaded, as we know to\nhave been the case in certain experiments with Eglinton and Slade ; or\nwhether the inquirers have simply forgotten to apply them, the result for\nus is much the same. Twenty-five years ago the hypothesis of fraud plus\nhallucination was at least as probable as the alternative hypothesis of a new\nphysical force. It is now so much more to be preferred, because the tests\nwhich alone could distinguish between fact and fantasy have been tried and\nhave failed ; or, in the alternative, those who have examined the phenomena\nhave proved themselves unfitted for their task by omitting to apply the tests\nat all.\nFrank Podmore.\n\fPart XXXIV.] 139\nReviews.\nHypnotism and Its Application to Practical Medicine, by Dr. Otto George\nWetterktrand, M.D. Translated from the German Edition by Henrik\nG. Petersen, M.D. London and New York. Putnam's Sons. 8vo.,\npp. 166.\nLa Revue de Psychologic Paris.\nL'Hypnotisme et L'Orthope'die Mentale, by Dr. Eikiar Berillos, Medical\nInspector of Public Asylums, and Editor of La Revue de L'Hypnotisme.\n8vo. pp. 45. Paris, 1898.\nAmong the medical pioneers of hypnotism no one fills a more prominent\nplace than Dr. Otto George Wetterstrand, of Stockholm, and we welcome a\nbook from his pen, especially so as he is a corresponding member of the\nS.P.R. and displays this title of honour on the title page.\nThough the English translation bears the date 1897, we find the German\nedition was published in 1891, and we must express regret that the results\nhave not been brought up to a later date, for much has been done in the\nlast six years to systematise and develop the use of hypnotic suggestion.\nHowever, we are glad to have the results of Dr. Wetterstrand's early years'\nexperiences, and hope he will soon supplement them by a new edition. We\nwould then suggest the addition of an index.\nDr. Wetterstrand is above all things a practical physician, and his book\nis written for medical men. He modestly disclaims any pretension to\nscientific completeness, and he refers the reader who requires a text book\nto the works of Liebeault, Bernhcim, Moll, etc. But scattered throughout\nthe book are many practical observations and reflections which are of\ngreat interest to the student of psychology as distinct from the physician.\nIt is more especially this psychological aspect which it is proposed to\nnotice here.\nDr. Wetterstrand at once proclaims himself as a follower of the Nancy\nSchool, as opposed to that of Charcot or the Salpetriere. As is well\nknown, Charcot investigated hypnotism almost entirely on hysterical women\nat the Salpetriere, and he regarded the hypnotic state as morbid, and, in\nfact, as an induced neurosis. Whereas Liebeault and Bernheim working\namong ordinary men and women at Nancy came to exactly the opposite\nconclusion, and consider hypnosis closely allied to ordinary sleep and a\nphysiological condition to which almost every healthy person is susceptible.\nThe Nancy theory is that now generally held, and no one with practical\nexperience can fail to endorse it. The Swedes are not supposed to be\nneurotic, or even highly imaginative, but they are noted for their fine\nphysique and practical common-sense. It is therefore interesting to compare\nDr. Wetterstrand's experience with that of other observers in other parts of\nthe world. Some years ago a German medical writer, after visiting Nancy\nand Paris, expressed his thankfulness that he was not a neurotic Frenchman,\nbut belonged to a nation whose people were insusceptible to hypnotic\ninfluence. The experience of Moll, Forel, Schrenck-Notzing and other\nphysicians in all parts of Germany, does not bear out this boast, and it is\ninstructive to find that the results achieved are very similar, whether\nreported from France or Germany, England or America, Sweden or Italy,\n\f140 [Supplement.\nDr. Charles Lloyd Tackey.\nDr. Wetterstrand finds temperament an important factor in hypnotism,\nand holds that fidgety, querulous and contentious persons are the most\ndifficult to influence. Age is a consideration. He says that all children from\n4 to 15 are hypnotisable, and he admits no exceptions except those of weak\nintellect. As one gets older, susceptibility, he says, seems to decrease, but\nhe finds that even in old age the majority of people are susceptible to a\ngreater or less degree.\nHe employs the method of persuasion, and in all cases endeavours to\ngain the patient's confidence before attempting to hypnotise him. When\nthere is apparent insusceptibility he often uses chloroform as a predisposing\nagent and endeavours to make the chloroform anaesthesia pass into the\nhypnotic state. He has been successful in several cases of this kind after\nrepeated attempts without chloroform had failed, and susceptibility once\ninduced the drug can be dispensed with. (p. 4.)\nOn several occasions he has obtained acceleration and retardation of the\npulse ratio by suggestion, and he has raised blisters on the skin and caused\nlocal bleeding in several susceptible subjects, (pp. 30, 32.)\nAs bearing out his idea that hypnotism is closely allied to ordinary sleep,\nhe relates (p. 34) how sleeping persons, especially children, can be made to\npass from one condition to the other. He places one hand lightly on the\nforehead, while with the other he makes some passes over the body, at the\nsame time telling the sleeper not to awake but to answer him. The sleeper\nsoon becomes cataleptic and replies to questions without waking.\nHe has endeavoured to repeat the phenomena of transference of paralysis\nfrom one side to the other by means of magnets observed by Charcot and\nBinet and Feri, but he has not obtained their results, and believes that\nsuggestion is the cause, as he has seen similar transference occur when a\nsham magnet made of wood has been substituted for the metal one.\nIn the therapeutic part of his book, Dr. Wetterstrand classifies diseases\nand gives his experience with hypnotism in each class. He finds it very\nuseful in the treatment of drunkenness and relates several striking cases.\nOne is that of an engineer who had had delirium tremens three times.\nHis wife was on the point of getting a divorce on the ground of incurable\ndrunkenness (this being possible in Sweden). He went to Dr. Wetterstrand\nfor treatment and was hypnotised fourteen times. A complete cure resulted\nand the couple went to America, where they got on well.\nDr. Wetterstrand notices, as do many other observers, that amemic\npersons are particularly good hypnotic subjects, and he has found that many\nbad cases of anaemia, especially those dependent on shock and depressing\nemotions, are cured by hypnotic treatment after ordinary remedies have\nfailed .\nAs he has succeeded in inducing hemorrhage by suggestion it is not\nsurprising to learn that he has seen it rapidly stop severe bleeding from the\nnose in a highly susceptible phthisical patient (p. 74).\nHe remarks (p. 79) that ho knows no remedy which exerts so soothing\nan influence over the dying person as hypnotic suggestion. His experience\nis borne out by other observers. At such times drugs often lose their effect,\nor become inadmissible, and the patient's last hours are rendered distressing\nby restlessness, irritability and sleeplessness.\n\fPart XXXIV.] 141\nRevieiv8.\nThe rapidity with which suggestion acts, even in removing such objective\nsymptoms as the swelling of joints after injury is shown by some of the\ncases. For instance, a boy of sixteen went to Dr. Wetterstrand on October\n13th, 1887. As the result of a blow about a month before on the knee, the\njoint was swollen, and he could neither bend nor straighten it, but kept it in\na semi-flexed position. Strong fluctuation could be felt in it, and there were\ntwo places above the patella painful on pressure. After being hypnotised he\nwas able to walk without limping, all pain had disappeared, and he could\nbend and extend the leg without difficulty. The next day the effusion had\nalmost entirely disappeared, and he could walk quite well (p. 108). Such a\ncase reminds one of many similar instances reported by Braid fifty years ago,\nand perhaps throws some light on the success sometimes attending the\noperations of \" bone-setters.\" These are often men of great ignorance, but\nof unbounded confidence, and they practically hypnotise many of their\npatients.\nDr. Wetterstrand says he knows of hundreds of people in whom he can\nproduce anaesthesia in any part of the body by a word, and he finds this of\ngreat advantage where he has to examine a sensitive part, \u00ab.;\/., the larynx\nwith the laryngoscope. The patient seems perfectly awake and yet the\nback of the throat may be tickled with a feather without producing any\ncough or sputter. Dr. Wetterstrand is extremely careful (p. Ill) not to claim\ntoo much for hypnotism, and states nothing but the results of his own\nexperience and observation. He reports failures as well as successes, which\nis not the invariable rule with medical men ! He confutes with much indig\nnation some of the theoretical objections levelled against hypnotism, and\nwhile acknowledging that it might be employed for evil purposes by bad\npeople, asserts that he has never seen anything but good follow its use in\nmedical practice. He finds that the cures are real and permanent, and that\nthere is no reaction to combat as is sometimes the case with other methods\nof treatment.\nIn a new edition perhaps Dr. Wetterstrand will tell us of the results he\nhas found to follow prolonged hypnosis, especially in cases of epilepsy.

One can\nwell understand the benefit which should follow such prolonged rest of the\nhighest brain centres in cases of \" nerve strain, \" cerebral exhaustion and\nrecurrent attacks of mania. We should also like to learn the result of the\nexperiments he stated his intention of making, with Professor Tigerstedt,\nthe physiologist, concerning the raising of blisters and the slowing of the\nheart's action, etc., by suggestion in somnambulists.\nThe last fifty pages of the book are devoted to four letters by the trans\nlator, Dr. Peterson, in which he gives a very clear account of his experience\nin Professor Bernheim's clinique at the Hopital Civile, Nancy, and expresses\nhis own views as to the value of hypnotism in disease and especially in the\ntreatment of moral obliquities.\n\u00a3\u00ab Revue de Psychologie is the second medical journal devoted especially\nto hypnotism and allied subjects published monthly in Paris. It is well\n\f142 Dr. Charles Lloyd Twckey. [Supplement.\nedited by Drs. Hartenberg and Valentin, and is now in its second year. In\nthe numbers for March and April Dr. Van Renterghem contributes two\narticles, in which he summarises his experience of hypnotism during the\nfour years 1893-97. As he, in collaboration with Dr. Van Eeden, has\npreviously related his experience in the two previous similar periods,1 we\nnow have available the carefully prepared record of this successful doctor's\nhypnotic practice for twelve years. During this third period he treated 488\npatients, 248 women and 240 men. Of this number 55 persons proved\ninsusceptible to hypnotic influence, about 11 per cent. ; 142 persons, or\nabout 29 per cent., were only slightly hypnotisable ; about 56 per cent., or\n271 persons, were profoundly hypnotised ; and about 10 per cent, of the\nwhole, or 47 persons, were hypnotic somnambulists, i.e., they had no\nmemory on waking of what had happened while asleep.\nThese figures are extremely interesting and instructive and will be\nfound to correspond pretty closely with those reported by other observers\nin different parts of the world when dealing with private as compared with\nhospital patients. In hospitals, as Bornheim finds at Nancy, the patients\nare more thoroughly under the physician's influence, and the atmosphere is\ncharged with suggestion ; hence the proportion of insusceptibles is much\nsmaller and that of somnambulists is much larger.\nCure, however, in psycho-therapeutics does not depend upon the depth of\nthe hypnotic state induced, and some of Dr. Van Renterghem's best results\nhave been obtained with patients who were only slightly hypnotisable. With\nsuch a treatment as the hypnotic at present it is found that the physician's\nclientele is largely made up of patients who have exhausted all other methods\nof cure, and Dr. Van Renterghem is therefore justified in expressing satis\nfaction that he has succeeded in curing 158 or 33 per cent, of his patients\nand in improving the health of about 36 per cent., or 176 patients. In 84\ncases, or 17 per cent., there was no effect, and in 70 cases, or about 15 per\ncent., the result of treatment was unknown.\nDr. Van Renterghem follows his previous classification and divides the\ndiseases he has treated into :\u20141. Those afl,ecting the nervous system. 2.\nThose affecting other parts of the body. The classification is rigorous and\nthe results are noted with accuracy. To the medical inquirer, therefore,\nthis record must be of great help, and much credit is due to Dr. Van\nRenterghem for the care and thoroughness he has shown in the task.\nWe note that he has treated ten cases of real epilepsy without a single\ncure or oven any marked improvement, and this unfortunate result is the\nmore disappointing since most observers have claimed at least to get some\namelioration in the severity of the cases they had treated. But in hystero-\nepilepsy, which is often confounded with real epilepsy even by some medical\nmen, he has been very successful, and also in that distressing and intractable\ncondition known as neurasthenia.\nAs one would expect, his greatest success has been in the treatment of\nneuralgias of functional origin, headaches, occupation neuroses (writers' and\n1 Comptes-renduH, etc., Bruxelles. A. Naucereau, 1889. Psychotherapie, Paris,\nSoc. d'edit., ScieiK., 1894.\n\fPart XXXIV.] 143\nReviews.\ntelegraphists' cramp) nervous dyspepsia, insomnia, and bad habits in children.\nBut he has also had considerable success in treating old paralyses of organic\norigin, locomotor ataxy, and the painful symptoms of phthisis, cancer, and\nBright's disease.\nAmong mental diseases he classifies chronic alcoholism, and he has been\nsuccessful with the two cases he has treated ; he has also cured some cases of\nmelancholia and\/oZie dudonte.\nDr. Berillon has made a special study of the application of hypnotism in\nthe education and treatment of children for over twelve years, and his\nofficial position has given him many facilities for experimenting in this field\non a large scale. The present pamphlet is the twenty-third contribution he\nhas published on the subject. In it ho treats of the method of procedure he\nadopts, the class of cases in which he applies hypnotism, and the results he\nobtains.\nFrom his personal experience of several thousands of cases, he deduces\nthe following conclusions :\u2014\n1. Eight children out of ten are hypnotisable to a profound degree at the\nfirst or second sitting.\n2. Normal children are more easily influenced than abnormal ones. The\nmore intelligent the child the more open he is to suggestion.\nDr. BeVillon thinks children should only be hypnotised by cautious and\nexperienced medical men for a definite purpose, and with these precautions\nhe considers the treatment absolutely free from risk, physical, moral, or\nmental.\nIt is in the treatment of degenerate children that he has found hypnotism\nmost valuable. Among the characteristic signs of degeneracy he places the\nexistence of certain habits which in these children tend to become automatic.\nHolding a first place among these is nail-biting, which is, however, generally\nassociated with other habits. By hypnotic suggestion he endeavours to raise\nthese automatic actions into the domain of consciousness, and then to arouse\nor create centres of inhibition. For instance, he tells the nail-biting child\nthat in future he will always be conscious of the habit, and will feel a weight\nand tension in his hand which will make it difficult for him to put it to his\nmouth, and that this feeling will call up a desire and power to resist the\nhabit. The same idea applies to kleptomania, of which he has cured many\nchildren. He observes that in a real kleptomaniac the impulse to steal is\nautomatic, beyond the control of the will, and the act often is only im\nperfectly remembered.\nDr. Berillon quotes some remarkable cases of extreme idleness, inatten\ntion, and pusillanimity which he has cured by suggestion. A medical man\nwas once heard to say that he should prefer to have his children naturally\nnaughty than hypnotically good. We imagine the question turns upon the\ndegree of naughtiness which may be considered natural. No sensible\nperson would advocate the indiscriminate hypnotising of young children,\nbut for cases where ordinary educational methods have failed hypnotic\nsuggestion is certainly a most valuable auxilliary and may save the child\nfrom an adolescence of misery and crime.\nChas. Lloyd Tuckey, M.D.\n\fJames H. Hydop. [Supplement.\nThe New Psychology. By E. W. Scripture, Ph. D., Director of the Yale\nPsychological Laboratory. 8vo. pp. 500. London : Walter Scott. New\nYork : Charles Scribner's Sons. 1897.\nThis work is a revision of a more popular treatise by the same author.\nThe popular features are still retained to some extent, but are supplemented\nby matter of more scientific interest. The animus of the book is a strong\ndefence of experimental methods in Psychology, especially the quantitative\nmeasurement of mental phenomena, as opposed to the introspective policy\nof the past. In the course of the work, the author meets psychical research\nin his path and assumes the office of fool-killer in seven pages ! The main\nbody of the work requires no discussion here. This belongs to the ordinary\npsychologist. It would also be as unnecessary to notice the author's\nanimadversions upon psychical research were it not for the persistent\ndemand all through the work for the utmost thoroughness and accuracy in\nthe investigation of facts.\nThe criticism which must be directed against the author is that he\nbetrays absolute ignorance of the subject which he attacks and ridicules.\nAnd this after such repeated demands for thoroughness. The accusation\nthus made can be easily substantiated by an examination of the author's\nremarks, (pp. 62-69.)\nProfessor Scripture's mode of attack consists in a comparison of what he\nregards as the slipshod method of psychical research and the more scientific\nprocedure of Hansen and Lehmann in their criticism of the Sidgwick\nexperiments. How much he knows about the Society's work is shown by\nthe single fact that there is not the slightest evidence of his ever having\nseen the Society's Reports. The first instance of this negligence is found\nin the reference to some experiments alleged to have been made by Dr.\nOchorovicz, and ridiculed here with a persiflage that is wholly unscientific.\nThe character of the experiments I do not defend. They may be anything\nyou please. But we are entitled to know where they were published and\nhow much weight was given them by Ochorovicz himself. Not a reference\nis given, while it would seem from the very language that Ochorovicz\nattached no value to them. The record of them is not found in any of the\npublications of the Society, nor can I find any trace of thom in Ochorovicz's\nbook on \"Mental Suggestion.\" A few of his experiments were mentioned\nin Phantasms of the Living, (\"Vol. II., p. 660 ff. ), but not a word in them\nrefers to the instances criticised by Professor Scripture. If psychical\nresearch is to be held responsible in this way for matter to which it has never\ngiven its imprimatur, what is to be said of the author's boasted scientific\nmethod ? I do not say a word in defence of either the method or the results\nof the Society's work. Any man may think what he pleases about this. I\nonly hold up the standard which Professor Scripture had set for himself.\nThe failure in this respect is seen in another incident.\nThe example of scientific method here recommended for imitation is that\nof the two Danish students, Hansen and Lehmann. The value and sugges-\ntiveness of their experiments I shall not question, but recognise with\nunstinted praise. But Professor Scripture shows no knowledge of either\nProfessor Sidgwick's original experiments or his reply (Proceedings S.P.R.,\nVol. XII.) to Hansen and Lehmann. Moreover, there are distinct indications\n\fPart XXXIV.] 145\nReviews.\nin the author,s statements that he has relied altogether on the article in\nWundt's Studien for both his material and his judgment of the subject. He\nsays : \" If we look through the hundreds of drawings in Richet's work, and\nin the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research, we readily see that\nthe resemblance of the two drawings [referring to the example taken from\nHansen and Lehmann's paper] is in only extremely few cases more than in\nthe one given.\" (p. 67.) This is an exact translation from the article in the\nSlndien, and is not included in quotation marks,1 as it should be, unless\nProfessor Scripture intends to imply that he has examined the publications\nof the S.P.R. But if he had done this he would have found no basis for\nsuch a reckless statement. I may refer him to the following places for proof\nof my allegation :\u2014Phantasms of the Living, Vol. I., pp. 39-48 ; Proceedings,\nVol. I., pp. 83-98, and 175-216 ; Vol. II., pp. 33-42, 195-200, and 208-215 ;\nVol. III., pp. 425-452; Vol. IV , pp. 116-126, and 324-337; Vol. V., pp.\n58-112, and 174-191; Vol. VI., p. 398, five pages; Vol. VII., p. 22, seven\npages, and p. 382, five pages. The statement quoted cannot be honestly\nmade by any man who has examined the diagrams given in these references,\nand it only shows that the author under review has abandoned his own\ninjunction to be thorough when he merely translates Hansen and Lehmann\nwithout sufficient acknowledgment, and without himself consulting the work\nof the S.P.R.\nFurther, Professor Scripture says :\u2014\"Hysterical or hypnotised persons\nare the most frequent percipients in such experiments.\" (Translation again\nwithout quotation marks.) But what evidence is produced for this state\nment ? None. Professor Scripture lays groat emphasis on quantitative\nmeasurements, and surely here is a statement that is capable of statistical\nproof if anything is. But not an iota of proof is given. This is scientific\nmethod ! The statement, indeed, is a pure assumption entirely without\nfoundation. But what if it were true 1 What difference would that fact\nmake in careful experiments of the kind under review, viz., drawings? The\npercipients could just as well be insane. It matters not who or what the\npercipient may be, if the precautions are sufficient to prevent fraud. If we\nshould prove telepathy, and assume or prove that the percipients were\nabnormal, the fact might require us to abandon the materialistic theory of\ninsanity.\nNot only, however, is Professor Scripture completely ignorant of the\nactual work of the Society for Psychical Research, but he is also apparently\ncompletely ignorant of the simple doctrines of chance that need to be\napplied for any exact estimate of the probable results in experiments in\nthought-transference. He supposes (p. 65) that if a counter be drawn by\nchance from a total of 90 counters, the probability that a random record out\nof the 90 figures will agree with it is only 1 in 8100 ! ! His words are :\n\" We might, like the psychical researchers, proceed to calculations of\nprobability, e.g., if a counter be drawn by chance from the total of 90\ncounters, the probability of drawing any particular one is 1-90, and likewise\nthe probability of recording at random any particular one of 90 possible\n1 The paragraph of which the above extract is part begins on the previous page\n(G6) with the remark : \" This case, continue the authors, seems to be quite note\nworthy,\" but no marks of quotation are used.\nh\n\f146 [Supplement.\nF. W. H. M.\nfigures is 1-90. Now, the probability that the two agree by chance is equal\nto the product of the separate probabilities, or 1-8100. Only once out of\n8100 times ought an experiment to succeed.\" The probability that Pro\nfessor Scripture describes is the probability that the number drawn and the\nnumber recorded will both agree with a previously designated number. But\nthis is not the question. For example, to take one of the instances quoted\nby Professor Scripture, the problem is not the determination of the chance,\nprior to the experiment, that the agent would draw the particular number\n33, and the percipient also guess 33. The problem is the determination of\nthe chance, that after the agent has drawn one of the numbers, no matter\nwhich, the percipient should guess the same number. The agent having\ndrawn 33, this number is already settled, and is calculated as a certainty.\nIt is one of 90 numbers, any one of which the percipient may choose, and\nthe chance that he will guess right is obviously 1 in 90. I do not blame\nProfessor Scripture merely for being ignorant of the very simplest applica\ntion of the laws of probability, but 1 do blame him for being ignorant and\nat the same time attempting, in a professedly scientific work, to deal with a\nsubject where some elementary knowledge of these laws is absolutely\nessential for even a superficial judgment.\nIn ordinary controversy, among persons not claiming to be \"scientific,\"\nwe rightly condemn any expositor who offers only a gross misrepresentation\nof the views he attacks, and shows an ignorance of the fundamental\nprinciples pertaining to the subject-matter ; but what shall we say of the\nculpability of a professed scientific investigator who in a professed scientific\nwork, actually makes a charge of \" unscientific methods of experimentation\"\nagainst a body of investigators of whose publications he shows absolute\nignorance, holding up to ridicule a gross travesty of the experiments upon\nwhich their conclusions are founded, and betraying at the same time a\nsublime ignorance of the quantitative estimate to be applied to their\nresults ?

[,w u u\nHours with the Ghosts. By Henry Ridgely Evans. (Chicago : Laird and\nLee. Pp. 302. 1897.)\nThis book, which is also otherwise entitled by the author as \"Nineteenth\nCentury Witchcraft\u2014Illustrated Investigations into the Phenomena of\nSpiritualism and Theosophy,\" scarcely pretends to add anything that is\nnew, of a constructive character, in the way of contribution to Psychical\nResearch.\nMr. Evans states in his preface that he \" has had sittings with many\nfamous mediums of this country and Europe, but has seen little to convince\nhim of the fact of spirit communication. The slate tests and so-called\nmaterialisations have invariably been frauds. Some experiments along the\nline of automatic writing and psychometry, however, have demonstrated to\nthe writer the truth of telepathy or thought-transference. The theory of\ntelepathy explains many of the marvels ascribed to spirit intervention in\nthings mundane.\" The author professes his belief that \" we bear within us\nthe undying spark of divinity and immortality,\" but after giving, in the first\npart of his book, a description of various \" mediumistic manifestations,\" con\ncludes that the majority of these are due to conjurmg, and that telepathy\nwill account for the rest without \" spirit intervention.\" He holds, however,\nthat the supernormal phenomena which he does accept seem to indicate that\nthe human personality is a \"spiritual entity\" which survives death.\nThe second part of the book is devoted to an account of \" Madame\nBlavatsky and the Theospphists,\" and includes references to the chief\nexposures which have thrown light upon the fraudulent methods used by\nsome of the leaders of the Theosophical movement. The author finds it\n\"difficult to place any reliance in the accounts of Mahatmic miracles.\" He\nalso adopts the conclusion justified by the researches of Mr. W. E. Coleman,\nthat \" ' Isis Unveiled ' and the 'Secret Doctrine,' by Madame Blavatsky\n. are full of plagiarisms and garbled statements.\" Mr. Evans\ndraws attention to facts concerning the early period of the Theosophic move\nment which many of Madame Blavatsky's followers to-day either are\nignorant of or prefer to forget. One of these facts is that Madame\nBlavatsky first located her Mahatmas in the ruins of Thebes and not in\nThibet. Another is that a lecture given by a certain George H. Felt was\nthe circumstance that primarily led to the founding of the Theosophical\nSociety. Mr. Evans should have given further details on this point, which\nl a\n\f148 [Supplement.\nRichard Hodgson.\nmay be found in the New York Herald for November 10th, 1895. The\ninformation given in that article was furnished by Mr. Henry J. Newton, a\nwell-known spiritualist of New York, since deceased, who had furnished me\nwith a similar account some years previously and had shown me the\ndocuments in his possession. It appeared that Mr. Felt asserted that\nphenomena of \" materialisation \" could be produced \" by a combustion of\naromatic gum and herbs.\" Mr. Newton claimed to have taken the first step\nin forming a society for the investigation of these particular phenomena, and\nto have himself proposed the name \" Theosophical Society.\" He also stated\nto me that the term Theusophy was chosen expressly on the basis of the first\nmeaning given to that word in IVebster's Dictionary: \"Any system of\nphilosophy or mysticism which proposes to attain intercourse with God and\nsuperior spirits, aad consequent superhuman knowledge, by physical pro\ncesses, as by the theurgic operations of some ancient Platonists, or by the\nchemical processes of the German fire philosophers.\" And hence the first\nsentence of the original preamble of the Theosophical Society read :\u2014\n\" The title of the Theosophical Society explains the objects and desires\nof its founders ; they seek to obtain knowledge of the nature and\nattributes of the Supreme Power and of the higher spirits by the aid of\nphysical processes. \"\nThe date of its organisation was October 30th, 1875, and not, as Mr.\nEvans states, November 17th. Even as late as the early part of 1879 the\nfirst of \"the general plans of the Society\" was declared to be : \"To keep\nalive in man his belief that he has a soul, and the Universe a God,\" which\nwas revised, at the end of the same year, into : \"To keep alive in man his\nspiritual intuitions.\" Indeed, the true inner history of Madame Blavatsky\nand the Theosophical Society yet remains to be written, though the sketchy\naccount given by Mr. Evans may sufficiently serve the purpose of the\noutsider who wishes to get a brief popular history of the movement.\nIn the first part of his book Mr. Evans relates several apparently super\nnormal experiences coming under his own notice, but it is to be regretted\nthat he gives no corroborative testimony in the cases where this seems to\nhave been obtainable. Thus he describes a railway accident, where an old\nman was decapitated by a locomotive between Washington and Baltimore.\nMr. Evans was on the train and saw the head, with white hair and beard,\nstanding in a pool of blood. Other details are given. On reaching\nBaltimore, Mr. Evans went to a newspaper office and wrote out an account\nof the accident, and did other work at the office before going home. His\nbrother, who slept in an adjoining room, had then gone to bed, and in the\nmorning related to the family a dream which he had during the night and\nwhich agreed in the main details with his brother's actual experience in\nconnection with the accident. Yet no statement is offered by the brother\nor any other member of the family, and the date of the incident is not given\nany nearer than ' ' the fall of 1890. \" Corroborative details should have been\ngiven either in a footnote or an appendix.\nFollowing these telepathic experiences, after a few pages concerning\n\"muscle-reading,\" Mr. Evans describes some of the trick methods used by\nfraudulent mediums, \u2014 among them, Henry Slade, The Davenport Brothers,\nAnnie Eva Fay, Charles Slade, Pierre L. O. A. Keeler, and F. W. Tabor,\u2014\n\fPari XXXIV.) 149\nRevieiv8.\nand has a little to say about \" Spirit-Photography \" and \"Thought-\nPhotography.\" If Mr. Evans had confined his attention to this part of his\nsubject and taken special pains to produce as far as possible a complete\nclassified exposition of the various trick devices used by mediums, he might\nhave rendered much more efficient service. It is a good work to popularise\nthe knowledge of the trick methods of fraudulent mediums, and we com\nmend Mr. Evans for what he has done in this direction. He offers a very\nmeagre account of Eusapia Paladino, and quotes from a statement in the New\nYork Herald, as though it had been communicated to that paper by myself,\nwhereas it is a grossly inaccurate account of a reporter's interview with me.\nIn describing the method of writing on the under surface of a slate held\nagainst the under surface of a table, Mr. Evans appears to think that the\n\" ability to write in reverse \" is involved. This is not necessarily the case.\nThe writing as \" visualised \" from above would appear in reverse, but the\nmotor changes, which are the most important, are largely the same as in\nordinary script. On p. 156 Mr. Evans writes :\u2014\n\"The 'spirit necktie' is one of the best things in the whole range of\nmediumistic marvels, and has never, to my knowledge, been exposed. A\nrope is tied about the medium's neck with the knots at the back and the\nends are thrust through two holes in one side of the cabinet, and tied in ii\nbow on the outside.\"\nManifestations follow which indicate that \" either the medium gets loose\nthe necktie and impersonates the spirits or the materialisations are\ngenuine.\" The explanation given by Mr. Evans is \"substitution.\" The\nmedium cuts the cord round his neck, thus releasing himself, and after pro\nducing the manifestations takes a second cord from his pocket, ties it round\nhis neck, and calls for the cord to be unfastened outside the cabinet. He\nthen pulls the first cord into the cabinet and conceals it in his pocket. The\ngeneral method of substitution in rope-tying tricks is not new, nor, indeed,\nis the general method of \" taking up alack,\" which, in this particular trick at\nleast, I think is superior to the method described by Mr. Evans, and of\nwhich an account was published by Col. Bundy in the Religio-Philuso1ihical\nJournal for May 9th, 1891, on information given by myself. The medium\nwas a Mrs. Martin, who was giving sittings in New York. She pulled in\n\" slack \" after she was in position in the cabinet, and before the rope was\ntied on the outside. She was thus able to widen the loop round her neck\nAnd slip it off, replacing it in position after producing the manifestations.\nI suspected the method used, did all the tying and untying myself, marked\nthe rope privately with a piece of crayon which I had \"palmed\" for the\npurpose, and examined the rope at leisure afterwards.\nAlthough Mr. Evans devotes more than forty pages of his book to\nD. D. Home, there is clear indication that he has not made any careful\nexamination of the mass of testimony to Home's phenomena, and in fact\nit is difficult to understand that, if he had ever even read the bulk of this\ntehtimony, he could have offered the \"cheap and ready-made\" accounts\nof the music-box tricks and fire-tricks as providing in themselves an\nadequate explanation of certain notable incidents described by Home's\nwitnesses. I refer to two other instances of the want of care shown by\nMr. Evans. He quotes a statement from \" Celia Logan, the journalist,\"\n\f150 [Supplement-\nRichard Hodgson.\nconcerning \"one of Home's seances at a nobleman's house in London,\"\nin which occurs the charge that the host saw Home place a bottle on\nthe mantelpiece just before leaving the room for the staircase where\nluminous hands wero seen. The host, it is alleged, seized the bottle and\nfound later that it contained \" phosphorated olive oil or some similar\npreparation,\" and \"after the discovery of the phosphorus trick he dropped\nHomo at once.\" Who is Celia Logan ? Where and when did this account\noriginally appear, and who was the host 1 We protest against any such\nvague and uncorroborated charge. At least two such charges against Home\nhave come under my own direct notice ; in each case the person making the\ncharge was compelled to acknowledge that the charge was completely un\nfounded, and, oddly enough, one of the charges was based upon a quotation\nfrom Home himself, who was describing the tricks of another medium.\nThis question as to the proof of fraud on the part of Home was considered\nfully in the article in the Journal S.P.R. for July, 1889, by Professor\nBarrett and Mr. F. W. H. Myers, and at that time no proof of fraud was\nforthcoming. Later, in 1897, Mr. Podmore writes (Studies in Psyehicat\nResearch, p. Ill) : \" I am not aware that clear proof of imposture was ever\nbrought forward against him.\" Again, Mr. Evans quotes the statement\nmade by Dr. Carpenter in the Contemporary Review for January, 1876,\nconcerning Home's alleged levitation, that \" a single honest sceptic declares\nthat Mr. Home was sitting in his chair all the time.\" This was proved to be\na gross misstatement, and was so proved by Captain C. Wynne, the supposed\n\"sceptic\" himself, who actually corroborated the account of the levitation.\n(See D. D. Home: His Life and Mission, by Madame Dunglas Home, p. 307 ;\nalso Journal S.P.R., July, 1889, p. 108.) In dealing with Home, Mr. Evans\nseems to have followed blindly the lead of Dr. W. A. Hammond's inadequate\ntreatment in his book Spiritualism and Nervous Derangement, published in\n1876. Whether Home's phenomena can be explained away or not\u2014and\nthere is a large mass of testimony to be taken into consideration\u2014they most\nassuredly have not been satisfactorily accounted for as yet by any ordinary\nexplanations which I have seen offered, and we cannot but condemn such\nignorant and superficial treatment as that accorded to them by Mr. Evans.\nI should, however, regret if I did Mr. Evans an injustice. Possibly he may\nhave intended merely to present a loose and popular view of Home by\nquoting various opinions for and against him ; but this would be hardly\nconsistent with his professed intention in his preface \"to give an accurate\naccount of the lives and adventures of celebrated mediums and occultists.\"\nGenerally I may say that much of the book consists of a compilation of\nextracts from various sources, many of which appear to have been selected\nwithout sufficient discrimination, and after a very partial and superficial\nsurvey of the subjects considered. I regret that I cannot speak more favour\nably of a book which is evidently written with sincerity and earnestness, and\nwhich recognises so sympathetically the value of the work performed by the\nS.P.R. There may be a class of readers to whose less substantial wants\nthe book may provide some temporary supply, but I should be surprised if\nour members found anything enlightening in the volume, unless it were, as I\nhave already indicated, some of the descriptions of trick-devices.\nR.

That theme has been often treated by learned meta\nphysicians ; and the present occasion is ill-suitod for metaphysics.\nWhatever my own respect for that science (of which, by the way, I\nam entirely ignorant), I think that here and now we had better take\nour stand upon the more solid ground of actual experiment. That,\nindeed, is a view to which you have all, more or less explicitly, given\nyour adhesion ; and your illustrious President has at different times\ngiven to the world examples of the value of experiment,\u2014however\ndaring and unforeseen, \u2014too brilliant to leave me any scruple in\nspeaking to you of Experiment as the true and rightful mistress of\nscientific enquiry.\nThe problem before us is how it comes to pass that the facts,\nso numerous and often so decisive, which you have accumulated\nduring the last twenty years have not carried with them any general\nconviction. The problem, I say, lies in the disaccord which still\nexists between the state of public belief and the existence of authentic\nfacts whose cogency would under other conditions have been by this\ntime admitted without dispute.\nTo explain this persistent incredulity, my simplest plan will be to\ngive you a sketch of my own history. I know well that l\u00ab moi est\nha,issable :\u2014\"I is a hateful word,\"\u2014as the great Pascal told us. But I\nuse myself only as a concrete example ; and a narrative of actual\nexperience may illustrate more convincingly than any theoretical\nexplanation could do, the strength of the resistance which the human\nspirit can sometimes oppose to proofs which the reason cannot but\nadmit as complete.\nConviction, indeed, cannot be achieved like a geometrical demon\nstration ;\u2014and it often happens that even a geometrical demonstration\ndoes not carry conviction to all minds. M. Thiers, it is said, when no\nlonger young, was anxious to get some notion of mathematics. His\nexcellent teacher one day proved to him, with all the rigidity of\n\fXXXV.] 153\nOn the Conditions of Certainty.\ngeometrical reasoning, that an oblique section of a cone, in whatever\ndirection it was made, was a regular ellipse. But this M. Thiers would\nnot admit. \"It is simply impossible,\" he said, \"there cannot be the\nsame ellipse at the cone's base and at its summit.\" To persuade him\nhis instructor had to send for a sugar loaf to make the oblique section,\nand to show him the actual ellipse. Experiment convinced the learner\nwhom theoretical demonstration had left incredulous.\nAll of us, indeed, are recalcitrant in accepting facts which do not\nseem concordant with the facts of every day. We are incredulous of\nthe extraordinary; and how incredulous I could hardly illustrate better\nthan by my own prolonged and almost invincible opposition to the facts\ncalled occult.\nAnd now, to begin with, we must get rid altogether of this word\noccult;\u2014or rather we must give it the only sense which it ought to\nbear. Occult means unknown. Alchemy, before it became chemistry,\niistrology, before it became astronomy, medicine, before it became\nliacteriology, were nothing more than occult sciences. Nor, indeed,\nwould it be very hard to show that the classic sciences, of which we\nare so proud, are not yet far removed from the occult stage. We may\nknow certain phenomena, and even the laws which govern their\nappearance; but we do not adequately understand a single one of them.\nTo say of the stone which falls to earth that it obeys an attraction\nwhich varies directly as the mass and inversely as the square of the\ndistance, is not to understand the stone's fall. Familiar though that\nphenomenon is, it is not a phenomenon which is understood in all its\nelements. Not one phenomenon, I repeat, is fully understood. All\n.ire linked together, and if we really understood one, we should under\nstand all.\nWhen I first began to occupy myself with the sciences called occult\nit was to make experiments in somnambulism. At that time, \u2014it was\nin 1873, very long ago!\u2014somnambulism was still a mysterious, magical\nscience ; and in the account which I gave of my experiments I began\nby saying, \" It needs a certain courage to pronounce the word\nsomnambulism.\" I was right, I think, to have this courage ; for a few\nyears later,\u2014and possibly my own efforts helped towards this change,\n\u2014somnambulism had taken its place among facts which no one denied.\nAs you know, the hypnotic trance is now matter of common know\nledge ; it forms a theme of ordinary medical instruction, and is no\nmore a subject of doubt than is small-pox or cholera. Thus may an\noccult science become a classic science in twenty years.\nIn the course of these studies I had here and there observed\ncertain facts of lucidity, of premonition, of telepathy ; but since these\nfacts were denied and ridiculed on every side, I had not pushed indepen\ndence of mind so far as to believe them. I deliberately shut my eyes\nm 2\n\f154 [PAHT\nProfessor Charles Richet.\nto phenomena which lay plain before me, and rather than discuss them\nI chose the easier course of denying them altogether. Or, I should\nrather say, instead of pondering on these inexplicable facts I simply\nput them aside, and set them down to some illusion, or some error of\nobservation.\nNay, in my servile respect for the classic tradition I mocked at\nwhat was called spiritism ; and after reading the astounding state\nments which Mr. Crookes had published, I allowed myself\u2014and here\ndo I publicly beg his pardon for it !\u2014to laugh at them as heartily\nas almost every one else was doing. But now I say just what my\nfriend Ochorowicz says in the same matter ;\u2014I beat my breast and I\ncry Pater, peccavi! How could I suppose that the savant who has dis\ncovered thallium and the radiometer, and foreshadowed the Rontgen\nrays, could commit gross and inexplicable blunders, and allow himself\nto be duped for years by tricks which a child could have exposed ?\nA certain experiment in spiritism (I keep the word, although it\ncorresponds to no theoretical idea at all) came to shake my disbelief.\nOne of my friends discovered that he possessed the curious faculty of\ncausing a table to go through certain movements\u2014for him involuntary\nand unconscious\u2014but which were nevertheless intelligent. That is to\nsay, one could put questions and get answers of which he had no know\nledge, although he remained fully awake, and his own personal\nconsciousness seemed quite intact. Unwilling to look for any cause\noutside the causes of familiar phenomena, I invented as an explana\ntion of these strange facts a theory which has not survived, and did\nnot deserve to survive,\u2014 the theory of hemi-somnambulism. This was\nin 1883.\nSeveral years before this date, one of my relations had experienced\nin my presence a telepathic hallucination, under circumstances of the\nmost striking kind. But of this I had taken no serious thought.\nLittle by little, however, as you went on accumulating in your\nProceedings facts of just the same order, this veridical hallucination\nof which I had been cognisant returned more strongly to my memory,\nand a kind of suspense and floating uncertainty took possession of\nmy spirit.\nIt must be remembered, too, in my excuse, that as a professional\nphysiologist I moved habitually along a road quite other than\nmystical. I had been taught a scrupulous respect for fact, a habit of\nexact and prosaic observation, controlled by rigorous tests ;\u2014by the\nbalance, the myograph, the chemical reaction. I began to feel myself\ndragged in two directions by contrary currents.\nIt would have been something if psychical experiments had been\nsusceptible of exact measurements ! But you know too well that this\nis not so. In the best experiments with sensitives there is always a\n\fXXXV.] 155\nOn the Conditions of Certainty.\ncaput mortuum which escapes analysis,\u2014something loose and approxi\nmate which fails to satisfy men who have taken as their motto these\nwords of the Preacher which govern science : \" Omnia in numero et\npondere.\"\nBut on the other hand the history of science showed me into what\nstrange mistakes men fall by ignoring facts plain to see. The wisest\nof our forerunners was blind to many a conspicuous phenomenon,\nsimply because it was a phenomenon which he could not understand.\n\" And may it not be thus,\" I said to myself, \" with these psychical\nphenomena? The unlearned deny them ; the learned exclude them\nfrom their text-books ; but they may exist for all that.\"\nThen, as my next step, I imagined,\u2014I ask your pardon for this\npublic confession,\u2014that certain psychological facts of lucidity, of\ntelepathy, perhaps of premonition, were true ; but that no occult facts\nactually affected the material universe. Our human intelligence, I\nsaid to myself, is perhaps endowed at certain moments with extra\nordinary powers, with faculties which remain latent in the mass of\nmen ; but that is all ; it cannot act directly upon matter.\nThis novel power of insight\u2014I thought\u2014 will in no wise alter our\nfundamental conception of the world ; the only truth in spiritism\nis just this lucidity. Nay, the lucidity itself, although it seems\npossible, even probable, is not as yet established by vigorous proof.\nI was at this point when M. Aksakoff came to see me in Paris,\nand reproached me for not interesting myself more keenly in experi\nments with mediums. \"Well,\" said I, \"if I were sure that a single\ntrue medium existed, I would willingly go to the end of the world to\nsee bin) ! \"\nTwo years later, M. Aksakoff wrote to me : \"You need not come\nto the end of the world ; if you come to Milan it will do.\" Milan !\nthat was not far to go to find the key of the mystery.\nI took part, then, in those celebrated Milan seances with Eusapia\nPaliidino; and while those seances were going on I was fully convinced\nof the reality of the phenomena. Numerous precautions were taken ;\nthe incessant repetition of tests and experiments satisfied the most\nscrupulous mind. When I left Milan I was fully convinced that all was\ntrue;\u2014as also were the eminent savants who took part in the sittings;\n\u2014Brofferio, Gerosa, Finzi, and the great astronomer Schiaparelli.\nBut at this point a remarkable psychological phenomenon made\nitself felt,\u2014a phenomenon deserving of all your attention. Observe\nthat we are now dealing with observed facts which are nevertheless\nabsurd ; which are in contradiction with facts of daily observation ;\nwhich are denied not by science only, but by the whole of humanity ;\n\u2014facts which are rapid and fugitive, which take place in semi-\ndarkness, and almost by surprise ; with no proof except the testimony\n\f156 [part\nProfessor Charles Richet.\nof our senses, which we know to be often fallible. After we have\nwitnessed such facts, everything concurs to make us doubt them.\nNow, at the moment when these facts take place they seem to us\ncertain, and we are willing to proclaim them openly, but when we\nreturn to ourselves, when we feel the irresistible influence of our\nenvironment, when our friends all laugh at our credulity;\u2014then\nwe are almost disarmed, and we begin to doubt. May it not all have\nbeen an illusion ? May I not have been grossly deceived 1 I saw, no\ndoubt ; but did I see aright 1 who can prove to me that I did so 1\nAnd then, as the moment of the experiment becomes more remote,\nthat experiment which once seemed so conclusive gets to seem more\nand more uncertain, and we end by letting ourselves be persuaded\nthat we have been the victims of a trick.\nOur own conviction, \u2014the conviction of men who have seen, \u2014\nought properly to convince other people ;\u2014but, by a curious inversion\nof roles, it is their conviction, the negative conviction of people who\nhave not seen, and who ought not, one would think, to speak on the\nmatter, which weakens and ultimately destroys our own conviction.\nThis phenomenon occurred in my case with such intensity that scarcely\na fortnight after witnessing the experiments with Eusapia Paladino, at\nMilan, I had persuaded myself that there had been nothing beyond\nfraud and illusion.\nNevertheless, I wished to repeat those experiments ; and at Rome,\nin company with an eminent savant, Schrenck-Notzing, and a\ncelebrated painter, H. Siemiradzki, I again made experiments of the\nmost decisive kind. But a second time I found that doubt seized me\nafter a short interval. I was not yet satisfied ; and I invited Eusapia\nto my house for three months. Alone with her and my excellent\nfriend, Ochorowicz, a man of penetrating perspicacity, I renewed\nthe experiments in the best possible conditions of solitude and quiet\nreflection. We thus acquired a positive proof of the reality of the\nfacts announced at Milan.\nOther friends belonging to your society, Messrs. Myers and\nLodge especially, came and shared our conviction. It has since\nundergone serious oscillation,\u2014partly from that psychological process\nof recurrence to habitual modes of thought already described, partly\nthrough the fault of the medium herself ;\u2014but my own fourth series of\nexperiments in Paris, brought with it for me, as also for Mr. Myei s,\na conviction of reality even stronger than before. Nevertheless,\nbefore discussing or publishing experiments in detail, a yet further\nseries should be held under the most careful conditions.\nIn the meantime it is quite possible that my friends and I may lose\nthat vigour of conviction which recent experience gives. We may\nreturn to that curious state of mind of which I have already spoken.\n\fxxxv.] On the Conditions of Certainty. 157\nThe real world which surrounds us, with its prejudices, well or ill-\nfounded, its scheme of habitual opinions, holds us in so strong a\ngrasp that we can scarcely free ourselves completely. Certainty does\nnotfollow on demonstration, itfollows on habit.\nBut the duty of the savant is precisely not to allow himself to\nfollow the routine of unreasoning respect for what Bacon termed idols.\nOur mission is to seek truth, without caring for the opinion of the\nvulgar. What should we care for popularity t Sarcasm or indiffer\nence ought to leave us equally unmoved.\nIf we have been credulous, our credulity has not been spontaneous\nand easy ; we have made, as you have seen, an obstinate defence. It\ntook me twenty years of patient researches to arrive at my present\nconviction. Nay,\u2014to make one last confession,\u2014I am not even yet\nabsolutely and irremediably convinoed ! In spite of the astounding\nphenomena which I have witnessed during my sixty experiments with\nEusapia, I have still a trace of doubt ; doubt which is weak, indeed,\nto-day. but which may perchance be stronger to-morrow. Yet such\ndoubts, if they come, will not be due so much to any defect in the\nactual experiment, as to the inexorable strength of prepossession\nwhich holds me back from adopting a conclusion which contravenes\nthe habitual and almost unanimous opinion of mankind.\nNote.\n[To explain what is here said of \" oscillation,\" it must be briefly\nstated that a series of experiments with Eusapia Paladino was made\nat Cambridge in the summer of 1895 ; that the chief investigators\narrived unanimously at the conclusion that systematic fraud had been\nused from first to last in these experiments ; and that reference to a\ndescription given by Professor Richet himself, in February, 1893, of\nthe manner in which Eusapia's hands were held \" en general,\" showed\nthat her main method of cheating in the Cambridge experiments must\nhave been practised by her systematically for years.\nIt ought to be added, in justice to Dr. Hodgson, who rendered\nmuch important aid in the exposure of her trickery at Cambridge,\u2014\nsince admitted by her own trance-utterance,\u2014that his opinion of\nEusapia Paladino's performances has been in no way modified by the\nbrief notes which were all that it was possible for Professor Richet\nand myself to make of certain experiments in Paris, on December 1st\nand 3rd, 1898, which appeared to us conclusive.\u2014F.

Discussion of\nwhether it was a \" lottery \" in the legal sense of the term. 322-330\nINTRODUCTION.\nBy a \" Coincidence \" is meant any conjunction of circumstances\nthat would primarily be regarded as accidental, but in which a special\naspect is involved, suggesting a causal relation. It is always this\nspecial aspect that attracts our attention, not the fact that the con\njunction is in itself a particularly unlikely one to occur. It has a\ncertain antecedent probability, which\u2014theoretically\u2014can always be\ncalculated ; and the calculation always shows it to be no more unlikely\nthan many other possible conjunctions. For instance, suppose that\nsome one had correctly prophesied what a certain hand at whist would\nbe. We can calculate what is the antecedent probability of getting\nthis hand and it will be found to be very small, but no smaller than\nthe probability of any other specified hand. The only noteworthy\npoint in the matter would be the correspondence between the actual\nhand and the prophesied hand, and this would suggest some cause,\nsuch as a preconcerted arrangement of the pack.\nThe consideration of the special aspect that attracts our atten\ntion in a coincidence is useful, because it may lead to the\ndiscovery of a cause hitherto unknown, or at least unrecognised by\nscience. The appearance of a causal relation, however, is often\nfallacious ; the circumstances may seem to come under the operation of\na common cause when they are really produced by entirely independent\ncauses, and such conjunctions or coincidences are accidental.\nIn psychical research we are constantly confronted with the\nquestion :\u2014are those coincidences which form the main material of our\nstudy,\u2014the apparitions seen at the time of death or of some crisis in\nthe life of the person represented, the cases of detailed apparent\nforeknowledge of events, the mass of correct information to be found\namong the utterances of at least one trance medium, the precise\nresemblances between the thoughts of two persons in successful\nexperiments in thought-transference, the movements of the divining-\nrod over concealed underground water,\u2014are all these coincidences to\nbe put down to chance, or is there something more in them 1\nIt may be thought that we have already discussed this question\nad nauseam and decided it. But this is at most true only in regard to\nsome sections of the above-mentioned classes of facts, and there is room\nfor difference of opinion about many of them. Thus, some persons may\n\f160 [part\nAlice Johnson.\nthink that the evidence for telepathy is conclusive, but not that for\nclairvoyance. Some may be convinced of the possibility of telepathy\nbetween the living, but yet remain dubious as to communications from\nthe dead. In deciding on this latter question, there are of course other\npoints to be taken into consideration besides the possible scope of\nchance coincidence. But I think the main doubt is whether\u2014after\nexcluding the cases that may be explained by telepathy from living\npersons \u2014those that remain are sufficiently numerous to be beyond\nchance. I do not propose to discuss this difficulty at all now,\u2014still\nless to pronounce any opinion upon it,\u2014I merely wish to point out\nthat in many lines of our work the question of chance coincidence is\nstill to the front and refuses to be shelved.\nThe chief reason why apparently telepathic phenomena may\nbe thought accidental is that we have no notion how telepathy\u2014\nassuming that there is such a thing\u2014causes the phenomena. We may\nsome time find traces of the method by which it works ; that is, we\nmay find some of the intermediate links between the cause and the\neffect. But, so far, we not only have no knowledge of any inter\nmediate links, but there is nothing which even affords any clue as to\nthe direction in which they should be looked for. Telepathy is\ngenerally defined as the action of one mind on another otherwise than\nthrough the recognised channels of sense. The action may be an\nexclusively mental one. Of course, in the case of telepathy between\nliving persons, the brain of each person must be supposed to be\nconcerned in the action, but the communication between the two\nminds may be exclusively mental, involving no physical energy of any\nkind. This would make it much more difficult\u2014if not impossible\u2014to\ndiscover the laws of the transmission, on account of the difficulty of\ndirect observation of any mental action outside our own minds. At\nall events, the evidence for telepathy rests for the present on two\nmain lines of argument. The first is the fact that a large mass of\napparently miscellaneous phenomena, for the occurrence of which\nthere is strong evidence, can be reduced to order and coherence by the\nhypothesis. It does not account for all the phenomena with which\nthe Society for Psychical Research deals ; but if we confine ourselves\nto really well-authenticated cases, we find that it covers a large pro\nportion, if not the great majority of them, just as the hypothesis or\ntheory of gravitation covers the apparently chaotic motions of the stars.\nIt is true that the theory of gravitation not only covers a much larger\nnumber of cases than the theory of telepathy, but also involves all\nsorts of complicated consequences, nothing clearly contradictory of\nwhich has ever been observed. Still, it seems to me that the evidence\nfor both theories is practically the same from a qualitative point of\nview, though so obviously not the same in quantity.\n\fXXXV.] 161\nCoiricidencen.\nThe second main argument for the existence of telepathy is that\nthe number of cases\u2014which may he spoken of here as \"coincidences,\"\nbecause it is always some kind of coincidence in them that indicates\ntheir supposed telepathic nature\u2014are far too numerous to be reason\nably attributed to chance. The argument is used for instance by De\nMorgan (see A Budget of Paradoxes, pp. 279-280) with regard to\napparitions seen at the time of death. He points out that if there\nwas no causal connection between the apparition and the death, we\nshould expect to find a comparatively large proportion of cases of\nwhat he calls \" the wrong spectre,\"\u2014that is, cases in which it is seen\n\"at the moment of the death of one or another of all the cluster\nwho are closely connected with the original of the spectre,\" instead of\nat the time of death of the original himself. But, says De Morgan,\nthis class of cases is \"almost without example.\" As a matter of fact,\namong our own more recent evidence, perhaps as many as half-a-dozen\ncases are to be found in which a near relative of the dying person was\nseen at the time of the death ; but this as compared with hundreds of\ncases where the dying person himself was seen.\nIn the present state of obscurity as to the mode of action of\npsychical causes, the statistical argument is the strongest one that we\ncan bring to bear in proof of their reality. Though we find its\nimportance recognised now and again by thinkers like De Morgan, and\neven in much earlier times, and hints thrown out as to the necessity of\nstatistical investigations for settling the question of chance coincidence,\nthe first serious attempts to collect statistics on anything like an\nadequate scale were made by the founders of the Society for Psychical\nResearch,\u2014 pre-eminently by Mr. Edmund Gurney,\u2014and some of the\nmost important work done by the Society since has been on these lines.\nI may recapitulate briefly some part of what has been done up to\nthe present. First, as to spontaneous cases of apparitions at the time\nof death of the person seen. Apparitions of persons known to the\nseer are not uncommonly seen when nothing particular is happening to\nthe person represented by the apparition. On the other hand, this\nperson sometimes dies at the time. Statistics have been collected by\nthe Society on an extensive scale to test whether the well-authenticated\ncoincidences of this kind are more numerous in proportion to the non-\ncoincidental apparitions than would be the case by chance, and they\nwere found to be very considerably more numerous.\nNext, with regard to experiments in thought-transference. In the\nearly days of the Society, some of the most striking results obtained\nwere in experiments in which the percipient attempted to reproduce\ndrawings or diagrams made by the agent,\u2014care being of course taken\nto prevent the former from gaining knowledge of them through any of\nthe ordinary channels of sense,\u2014and much useful work might be done\n\f162 Alice Johnson. [part\nnow by persons who have opportunities of repeating these experiments.\nThey were criticised on the ground of the familiar fact that the minds\nof men have a tendency to run in certain grooves,\u2014so that, for\ninstance, if one is asked to think of or to draw objects, or to think of\nplaying-cards or numbers, each person, though he may not be aware of\nit, has favourites and is more likely to think of some objects, cards, or\nnumbers, than others. These mental \" habits,\" as they are sometimes\ncalled, may be alike in several persons ; and when this is so in the case\nof two experimenters, a certain proportion of the diagrams drawn by\nthe percipient may resemble those drawn by the agent, and thus\nsimulate the phenomenon of thought-transference. Similarly, if cards\nor numbers are chosen by the agent, his mental habits may lead him to\nchoose a large proportion of those that happen also to be favourites\nwith the percipient, who will therefore have a better chance of guessing\nright. This is, of course, one reason why it is always best for the agent\nin experiments with cards or numbers to draw them at random from a\nbatch and not to choose them.\nIn order to test how far mental habits might have simulated\nthought-transference in the experiments with diagrams, Colonel Taylor\ncarried out a series of dummy experiments, made in the same manner\nas the experiments in thought-transference, but with the element of\nthought-transference eliminated (see Proceedings of the S.P.R.,Yol. VI.,\np. 398). He got eighty persons to draw twenty-five diagrams each,\nand so obtained 1,000 pairs of diagrams, which could be compared\naccording to a pre-arranged plan. The comparison showed how\nmany resemblances were actually produced by chance, combined with\nsimilarity in the mental habits of the persons who drew the diagrams ;\nand the number of resemblances were found to be proportionately far\nless than those found in the experiments in thought-transference. 1\nIn experiments with drawings, where the number of possible\ndrawings is unrestricted, it is, of course, impossible to calculate how\nmany successes might be obtained by chance ; the question can only be\n1 To this it may be objected that the persons who drew the diagrams being taken\nat random, there was no reason to expect similarity in their mental habits ; whereas\n\u2014since some experiments in thought-transference fail, while others succeed\u2014it might\nbe argued that only those succeed where the mental habits of agent and percipient\nhappen to be similar. Similarity of mental habits could not, of course, in any case\nensure success, because it would be very unlikely that the percipiont would think of\nhis favourite forms in the same order as the agent ; but it might increase the chance of\nsuccess. In many of the experiments in thought-transference, however, the diagrams\nwere drawn or selected by some person other than the agent, and not always the same\nperson, so that a yeneral similarity in mental habits\u2014as well as a general tendency to\nthink of the favourites in the same order\u2014would have to be assumed, and this seems\nto be negatived by Colonel Taylor's experiments. The most crucial test of the hypo\nthesis would be to see whether any considerable proportion of the diagrams in\nsuccessful experiments are those which there is reason to regard as general favourites,\nand I do not think it is possible to maintain that this is the case.\n\fXXXV.] 163\nCoincidences.\ntested empirically, and a very large number of trials is necessary to\nensure a completely satisfactory test.\nTaking next the thought-transference of numbers, two Danish\npsychologists, Messrs. Lehmann and Hansen, have attempted to prove\nthat unconscious whispering\u2014a possible source of error which, I need\nhardly say, had been present to the minds of the experimenters from\nthe first\u2014accounted for the successes obtained. They found that\nwhen they tried similar experiments with one another they had a\ntendency to whisper the numbers unconsciously, and the one who was\nplaying the part of percipient at a little distance from the agent heard\nindistinctly what was whispered, and thus often got the number right.\nBut the most important part of their criticism consisted in showing\nthat, when the number was guessed wrong, through being heard too\nindistinctly, the same mistakes were often made as were made in the\nexperiments in thought-transference. For instance, 2\u2014when it was\nnot guessed right\u2014was guessed as 3 more often than anything else in\nboth sets of experiments. This suggested that the mistake was due\nto the same cause, viz., indistinct hearing of a whispered sound, in\nboth cases. The argument was founded on coincidences in mistakes,\nwhich were certainly striking at first sight. Further investigation,\nhowever (see Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XII, p. 298), showed the\ninconclusiveness of this reasoning. There was a certain series of\nexperiments in thought-transference in which agent and percipient\nwere in different houses, so that the hearing of unconscious whispering\nwas out of the question. In this series, the number of successes was\nnot above what might have been produced by chance ; so that all the\nresults that occurred in it\u2014both right and wrong\u2014were to be put\ndown to chance alone. Now it was found that there were quite as many\ncorrespondences (as to the mistakes that were made most frequently)\nbetween this series and Messrs. Hansen and Lehmann's whispered\nseries as between theirs and the thought-transference series. It follows\nthat the correspondences or coincidences that seemed so remarkable\nwere not beyond what chance could produce, so that no argument as\nto the cause of the mistakes made could be founded on them.\nIn the present paper, no attempt is made to carry on further any\nstatistical inquiry of this kind, but rather to compare on more\ngeneral grounds the curious coincidences sometimes met with in\nordinary life to those met with in psychical research. With regard to\nthe examples selected, I have tried to consider as far as possible\nwhether they are due to some cause which is not immediately obvious ;\nand if not, whether there is any reason to suppose that they are not\nthe result of chance. For this end, I endeavour to consider whether\nthe probability of their occurrence is great or small. In choosing\ncases, I have been guided chiefly by the apparent improbability of\n\f164 [PART\nAlice Johnson.\ntheir occurrence,\u2014the common sense impression of their oddness. The\ndegree of improbability is sometimes less than the narrators of the\nincidents seem to think ; but in most of my cases, no numerical\ncalculation of it is possible ; only a very rough estimate can be formed,\nand on general grounds alone. There is, however, a case of two\npersons guessing independently the numbers drawn in a lottery, where\nthe chances against the double event were calculated by a competent\nmathematician as about 22 billions to 1 (see p. 249). It is very\nremarkable that a coincidence such as this should occur,\u2014by which I\nmean that it must be so exceedingly rare that we are justified in\nfeeling surprised when we meet with it. But if nobody ever met\nwith such a coincidence, we should be still more surprised ; as the\nvery reasoning which shows us that it is not likely to occur more than\nonce in a certain large number of times, shows us also that it is not\nlikely to occur less than once. The improbability in this particular\ncase is enormously in excess of the improbability of any one of the\ncoincidences we meet with in psychical research,\u2014so far as we are able\nto estimate them numerically. But, as already implied, for the proof\nthat these psychical coincidences are beyond chance, we do not depend\non the degree of improbability of any one coincidence, but on the\naccumulation of many coincidences of certain well-defined types ; and\nin deciding whether other coincidences are accidental, we have to\nconsider whether they too fall into natural classes too numerous to be\naccounted for by chance.\nSince we are dealing with cases which \u2014like apparitions seen at\nthe time of death \u2014obviously might be due to chance alone, the\nquestion is complicated by an inevitable uncertainty as to which\ncoincidences, if any, are due to chance and which are not. All that\nthe theory of probability can tell us is that out of a certain number of\nevents, the most likely number of coincidences is so-and-so. If we find\nthe actual number to be largely in excess of this, we are justified in\nthinking it probable that something beyond chance has operated in the\nwhole group of events taken together. But we are not justified in\ndrawing any conclusion about any individual coincidence. The very\nsame reasoning that has led to the conclusion that the whole group of\ncoincidences taken together is not due to chance involves the assumption\nthat some of the coincidences are due to chance, and affords no criterion\nby which we can distinguish these coincidences from the others. In\ncourse of time, however, we may learn enough about all the circum\nstances and processes concerned to enable us to distinguish between\ncasual coincidences and those which arise from a cause, and reasoned\nspeculation based on psychical research has, in fact, already reached\nsuch a stage that we may often be more or less convinced on rational\ngrounds as to the nature of a given coincidence.\n\fXXXV.] 165\nCoincidences.\nCHAPTER I.\nON THE ClASSIFICATION OF COINCIDEncES.\n\" To understand what a thing is, one must generally give some attention\nto appreciating what it is not. . . . Applying this plan to the term\n' Chance,' there will be found to be two sets of terms which are very com\nmonly used to indicate an antithesis. One of these is 'Causation,' and its\nsynonymes, and the other ' Choice ' or ' Design.' These two sets of terms\nmark in strictness ... a very different kind of opposition ; but the\ncontroversies to which they give rise will be found to overlap, and in some\ninstances to merge into one another.\"\u2014J. Venn. The \u00a3u>\/ic of Chance.\n(2nd Edition, p. 224).\nThe quotation just given suggests a basis for the provisional\nclassification of Coincidences which I propose to adopt. I divide\nthem accordingly into three classes:\u2014 (A) Coincidences suggestive of\n\" Causation \" ; (B) Coincidences suggestive of \" Design \" ; (C) Coin\ncidences due to \" Chance.\"\n(A) Coincidences suggestive of \"Causation.\" In this class there\nseems to be a definite causal connection between the coinciding events.\nEither one causes the other, or both are due to a common cause, such as\nthunder and lightning resulting from a certain condition of the atmo\nsphere. The mere fact of two events frequently happening together\nmay lead to the discovery of new causes. Many scientific discoveries\nhave, indeed, resulted from the observation and study of coincidences.\nWhen the things that coincide are due to chains of causes that are\nup to a certain point independent, the coincidence may yet be by no\nmeans accidental. Examples of this may be found in the extra\nordinarily minute imitation of plants or other objects by some animals,\nespecially insects, the imitation being so close as frequently to deceive\nboth other animals and human beings. For instance, the following\naccount of an incident observed by Mr. Belt in Nicaragua is given\nin Wallace's Darwinism (2nd Edition, p. 203). Describing the\narmies of foraging ants in the forests which devour every insect they\ncan catch, Mr. Belt says :\u2014\" I was much surprised with the\nbehaviour of a green leaf-like locust. This insect stood immovably\namong a host of ants, many of which ran over its legs without ever\ndiscovering there was food within their reach. So fixed was its\ninstinctive knowledge that its safety depended on its immovability,\nthat it allowed me to pick it up and replace it among the ants without\nmaking a single effort to escape. This species closely resembles a green\nleaf.\" Now the ants no doubt took the locust for a green lea?, and if\n\f166 [part\nAlice Johnson.\nthey had been able to consider how it had been produced, they would\nprobably have argued that, like other green leaves, it had grown on a\ntree. A very little knowledge of natural history suffices to show that\nthe antecedents of a locust are totally different from those of a green\nleaf,\u2014that two independent chains of antecedent events have in this\ncase produced two closely similar effects. But a good deal of further\ninvestigation is required to prove that the similarity is not accidental,\nbut was brought about by a definite cause, \u2014the gradual selection in\none generation of locusts after another of the individuals who escaped\ndestruction through a constantly increasing resemblance to their\nsurroundings.\n(B) Coincidences suggestive of \"Design.\" Design is, of course,\na cause, but from some aspects of such a different character from\nother causes that it is convenient to treat it separately. Typical\ninstances of the class are coincidences or combinations of events that\nmake so decidedly for the convenience or inconvenience of particular\nindividuals that\u2014to their minds, at least\u2014the idea of a special\nintervention on their behalf or against them may be forcibly suggested.\nYet these combinations of events may seem to be of exactly the same\ncharacter as many other combinations which affect nobody, and are\ntherefore considered accidental, their only distinguishing feature being\ntheir importance to the individual. Thus, supposing a man misses a\ntrain through his watch being slow and the train meets with an\naccident in which all the passengers are killed ; or supposing he\nmisses a train which meets with an accident in which no one is\ninjured. The two coincidences would be of just the same apparently\naccidental character ; yet he would probably be inclined to attach\nmuch more significance to the first than to the second. It is, of\ncourse, easy to suppose that the man's watch would have been slow\nthat day in any case, quite irrespective of what was going to happen\nto the train\u2014that, in fact, it was not specially contrived to make him\nmiss the train; just as we assume, speaking generally, that the numbers\nthat turn up in a lottery are determined by chance, without reference\nto the question whether any one has a stake on them or not. Still,\ncoincidences of this kind may conveniently be treated as a separate\nclass.\n(C) Coincidences due to \" Chance,\" that is, those in which the\ncoinciding events are due to independent causes. Mr. Gurney\nmakes the following remark on casual coincidences (see Phantasms\nof the Living, Vol. II., p. 18, foot-note) :\u2014\" In a general way,\ncoincidences where previous experience affords some ground for\nsuspecting (however faintly) a cause other than chance are distin-\nguished*from coincidences where no such ground exists by this fact\u2014\n\fXXXV.] 167\nCoincidences.\nthat the latter sort of cases, if a priori highly improbable, are\nnot mentioned or described until after they have happened. From\nthe mere fact that they do not belong to any known or surmised type,\nthey do not enter into any one's head ; no one suggests, without any\nsort of grounds, that a particular thing will happen to some one at\na particular time, or predicts any particular highly improbable coin\ncidence, and then afterwards finds this thing or this coincidence\nactually occurring.\" For instance, he says, \"The odds are very great\nagainst two of the foremost men in a century being born on the same\nday ; yet this happened in the case of Darwin and Lincoln, and no\none imagines that the one birth depended on the other.\"\nThere are two obviou3 difficulties in making use of the provisional\nclassification suggested: (1) we often cannot tell to which class a\ngiven coincidence belongs ; and (2) doubts may arise as to what dis\ntinctions really exist between the classes. The second point needs\ndiscussion first, the words \" Design,\" \" Causation,\" and \" Chance \"\nhaving been used above in their ordinary popular sense, which perhaps\nrequires definition.\nDesign and the antithesis between it and Chance.\nThe word \" Design \" is generally intended to convey the idea that\nan intelligent Will is manipulating circumstances with some pur\npose\u2014some end in view. When we speak of the means as being\nconsidered more important than the end\u2014if, e.g., a man refuses to\ngain some advantage for himself by an immoral action\u2014this is rather\na loose way of speaking. We do not really mean that the end is\ndisregarded ; but that the end ultimately aimed at is not the particular\nadvantage, but morality. Whatever the end may be, and though it\nmay vary from moment to moment, there is always at any given\nmoment in the case of intelligent human action, some end which is\naimed at. Effort is concentrated and attention chiefly fixed on one\ncircumstance or condition, all the others being regarded as relatively\nunimportant. For a finite intelligence with personal interests, it is\nindeed inevitable that certain things should seem vastly more important\nthan others.\nThe antithesis between Chance and Design is clear, so long as we\nconfine ourselves to human action. To say that a series of events is\na Chance series, and not produced by Design, means that human voli\ntion determines that some events of certain kinds shall occur, but does\nnot choose exactly which event it shall be each time, leaving this to\ndepend on the external physical conditions, which are expressly\narranged in such a way as to allow of several alternative events. For\ninstance, in games of pure chance, the player places the object used in\nN\n\f168 [paut\nAlice Johnson.\nsuch a position (e.g., up in the air) that one of several things must\nhappen (e.g., if the object has several flat faces, it must fall on one of\nthem) ; but he expressly abstains from determining which of the things\nshall happen. If, instead of behaving thus, he deliberately aims at\nproducing one event to the exclusion of the other possible ones, the\nevent is said to be due to Design.\nAnother typical case is that of a marksman, with some degree of\nskill, firing at a target, when the particular arrangement of any large\nnumber of shots on the target will be the result of Chance. Here the\ncentre of the target may be compared with the particular event in a\ngame of chance on which the player stakes at any given moment. It\nis true that the two cases are not altogether analagous, because the\ngeneral distribution of the shots depends to a considerable extent on\nthe skill of the marksman. The greater his skill, the more will they\ncluster about the centre. Whereas in a game of pure chance, the\nvariations in the events depend merely on the external conditions, and\nnot at all on the actions of the player. But the marksman also de\nliberately leaves something to be determined by external conditions,\u2014\nsuch as gravitation and the wind,\u2014which he does not attempt to con\ntrol, though he varies his own action to allow for them. If he simply\ndetermined to touch the centre of the target with the bullet, he might\ncarry it in his hand up to the target and do so, just as the player\nmight keep his dice in his hand and turn them at will. This would be\nthe work of Design in both cases. But whenever Design, of its own\naccord, stops short of deciding between several alternatives, the final\nresult is due to Chance.\nA Chance series such as the distribution of shots on a target is often\nrepresented by a diagram like the following.1 BAC is a horizontal\nBKHGADEFC\nstraight line, whose central point A represents the centre of the target ;\nother points, D, E, F, G, H, K, in the line to the right and left of A,\nrepresent areas in the target at distances to the right and left of its\n1 The samediagram can be used to represent various features in a series of throws\nof dice, etc., but the method of doing so is a rather more complicated one, and the\nexplanation of it is therefore omitted.\n\fxxxvl] 169\nCoincidences.\ncentre,1 proportionate to the distances of the respective points from A.\nFrom all these points vertical lines are drawn upwards, proportionate\nin length to the number of shots that hit the corresponding areas in\nthe target. If the upper ends of these lines be joined together, the line\njoining them approaches to the form of a curve, as shown in the figure.\nThe larger the number of shots, the smaller is it feasible to make the\nsubdivisions in the target and the corresponding subdivisions in the line\nB A C, and the smoother and more symmetrical will the curve repre\nsenting the distribution of the shots become. The ideal chance distribu\ntion in such a case is represented by a perfectly symmetrical curve,\nand when any curve representing a large number of incidents or events\napproximates closely to this, there is strong presumption that the whole\nseries was due to Chance and not to Design (or any other cause).\nIt is, however, often very difficult to find out what has produced a\nsingle event. For instance, if we only saw the upshot of a single\nevent\u2014say, a pair of dice lying on a table with certain faces upper\nmost\u2014it would be impossible to say whether this had been produced\nl>y Chance or Design.\nIn some individual cases, however, there may be grounds for form\ning a judgment on this point. Suppose, for instance, that in a game of\nwhist all the thirteen trumps are found in one hand. A hand of thirteen\ntrumps is a highly improbable hand, but is just as likely to occur by\nchance as any other given hand. In other words, among all the millions\nof possible hands, there is no one individual case which is more likely\nto occur than the case of thirteen trumps. It is, of course, infinitely\nmore probable that some other one among the millions should turn up,\nhut not at all more probable that any particular one should do so.\nIt was, then, quite possible that the thirteen trumps came into one\nhand by Chance. The reason why we may doubt if they did so has\nnothing to do with our knowledge of the workings of Chance, which\npractically gives us no help in the case. It is simply that some one\nprofits by the hand of thirteen trumps more than he would by any\nother hand, and there is therefore a motive for him to manipulate the\npack with a view to this result. Such a case does not, of course,\nafford conclusive proof of Design, but it certainly affords evidence of\nit\u2014evidence more or less strong, according to the circumstances.\nT\/ie Operation of Chance in Nature.\nThere are many groups of things in Nature, altogether outside\nhuman control, which it is possible to represent by diagrams like the\n1 The particular method of subdivision of the target into areas is a matter of detail.\nPerhaps the best way would be to divide it into concentric ring-shaped areas round the\nbull'seye, and then draw a vertical line through the centre and take as units the halves\nof the areas on the right and left sides of the vertical line.\nN 2\n\f170 Alice Johnson. [part\none given above ; for instance, the heights of a large number of men,\u2014\nif represented in the same way as the shots on the target, \u2014will form a\nsimilar curve, the number of men of the average height being indicated\nby the central vertical line, and the numbers of men of various\nheights in excess or defect of this by the vertical lines on either\nside of the centre. These become shorter as they recede from the\ncentre, showing that the more any height differs from the average,\nthe fewer men of that height are to be found. The average in this\ncase may be called the type, and the analogy is suggested of Nature\naiming at the type, as the marksman aims at the centre of the target\nThis is, of course, nothing more than an analogy, though in some\nrespects a very close and instructive one. Among the two series, we\nmay find several instances of (a) two men of the same height, and of\n(6) two shots hitting the same spot on the target. All these are\naccidental coincidences, that is, similar effects produced by independent\ncauses ;\u2014the heights do not influence one another, nor do the shots.\nThe coincidences obviously become more numerous as we approach\nthe average height in one case and the centre of the target in\nthe other; since in doing so, there are a greater number of heights or\nshots, as the case may be, per unit of area. This, however, does not\nmake the coincidences any the less accidental ; they are only the more\nlikely to occur.\nThe same remarks would apply to the heights of a number of hills\nas to the heights of the men. If any of them coincide, it is not the\nresult of some force directed towards making one the same height as\nanother. Separate causes have acted in each case, and it is only by\naccident that similar effects have been produced.\nSuppose, however, we compare with this the heights of the tide in\na number of different places. If the tide is at the same height at a\ngiven moment in two places a little way off each other, this coincidence\nis not accidental, but produced by a common cause,\u2014the combined\nattraction of the sun and moon on the two places.\nA practical criterion of whether these three kinds of coincidences\nare accidental or not may be afforded by asking the question :\u2014\nDoes knowledge of the height of one man, or hill, or tide, enable us to\ninfer what the height of another specimen of the same class will be 1\nAfter measuring the height of one man, we should expect to find\nthat another will be more nearly of his height than of the height, say,\nof a giraffe or of an ant ; and the more men we measured, the greater\nwould be our confidence that any other man's height would come\nwithin certain limits ; similarly with the heights of hills (though here\na certain vagueness would be introduced by having to settle arbitrarily\nwhat height must be attained before a rising of the ground can be\ncalled a hill at all). A.similar method might also be applied to tides ;\n\fXXXV.] 171\nCoincidences.\nwe might satisfy ourselves by a large number of measurements that the\nheights of all terrestial tides would be almost certain to lie within\ncertain limits.\nThe distinction between the classes lies in the fact that in the cases\nof men and hills, we should never reach the point of predicting exactly\nwhat the height of any one specimen would be, because the heights\nare produced in each specimen by causes that are to a large extent\nindependent of the causes that affect the other specimens ; whereas\nexact measurement of the height of one tide (combined with other\nascertainable facts) might theoretically give us the heights of all other\nindividual tides, because of the common cause producing all of them.\n(For a full discussion of a case illustrating this theoretical distinction,\nsee Appendix IV.)\nDistinction between Causation and Design.\nBy \" Causation \" we mean such a connection between events that\nthe same consequences always follow from the same antecedents.\nCausation is a more general term than Design\u2014Design being merely a\nspecial case of Causation. There is therefore no antithesis belween\nthe two terms, and they are sometimes used to imply two different\naspects of the same thing. When we speak of Design in an action\nwe are thinking of the subjective aspect, \u2014the point of view of the\nactive Intelligence controlling it. When we speak of Causation we are\nreferring to the objective aspect\u2014the method of action used to produce\nthe result.\nCausation and Design in Nature.\nMany of the operations of Nature\u2014of inanimate Nature, at least\n\u2014carry with them no suggestion of their existing for the sake of any\npurpose or end. They merely present the appearance of a number of\nevents inevitably following by fixed laws the events that have gone\nbefore them, and inevitably leading on in a similar way to future\nevents\u2014that is, they seem simply to exemplify the working of Causa\ntion. When we come to sentient living organisms, individual Wills\nand Designs begin to come into existence, and there begins to be\nscope for the pursuit on their part of the one most obvious and rational\npurpose of Happiness. We may next imagine a Universal Design,\nembodying and transcending the designs of all the individuals. But\nthe working of Causation is in no way excluded or superseded by the\nexistence of Design. The conception of Causation seems to imply that\neach separate item with which it is concerned forms part of one large\nscheme of which every portion is important as regards the whole,\u2014since\nthe character of the whole would be altered if it were absent, or in any\nway different from what it is,\u2014but of little or no importance as regards\nitself taken alone. Supposing that the whole of creation were made\n\f172 [part\nAlice Johnson.\nup in this way of parts, past, present and future, all rigidly determin\ning one another, it would not even then follow that Design was\nabsent, for the whole scheme might obviously be the work of Design.\nFurther, this Design might\u2014as a human being would in an analogous\ncase,\u2014regard some parts of the scheme as more important than others,\nand construct it with some view to the happiness of individual\norganisms.\nTo illustrate this point, let us consider the case of eclipses of the\nsun or moon. These eclipses can only be of extremely slight im\nportance in the solar system, involving nothing more than a brief\ninterception of the rays of light falling on part of the earth or moon,\nwhile the effect of gravitation on the sun, earth, and moon at the\ntime is very slightly different from its effects under other circum\nstances. That is, on the whole the condition of the three bodies at\nthe time of an eclipse is imperceptibly different from their condition\nan hour before or an hour after the eclipse. For the astronomer,\nhowever, there are few events that can compare in importance with\nthese eclipses, from which a great part of his knowledge has been\nderived. Yet we do not suppose that the solar system was arranged\nso that eclipses might occur with a special view of instructing\nastronomers ; because we see that it would be difficult,\u2014if not im\npossible,\u2014to construct a solar system in which eclipses did not occur\non anything in the least like its present plan. They are clearly a sort\nof bye-product of the general scheme, and the fact that their\noccurrence tends to facilitate scientific discovery does not affect our\nview of them. Still, it does not seem altogether irrational to suppose\nthat this incidental advantage may have been one of the points taken\ninto consideration in constructing the whole plan.\nAt the same time, it is difficult to see how there could be any clear\nproof that the universe was the work of Design and not the result of\nunintelligent mechanical forces, except through some striking change\nin the known and more or less familiar course of Causation ; while,\neven if such a change occurred, it would always be possible to put it\ndown to the action of a cause, similar in kind to known ones, but\nmanifest only on rare occasions.\nDistinction between Chance and Causation.\nThe distinction between Chance and Causation is theoretically\na perfectly sharp and clear one. Causation is an even and inevitable\nflow of sequences, unhurried and uninterrupted. If we were able\nto isolate a simple series of events causally connected (as we can isolate\na chance series of events) it would appear that each event depended\non the preceding ones, and contributed to the sum of conditions\nby which all the following ones were determined, so that knowledge of\n\fXXXV.] 173\nCoincidences.\nwhat had happened up to a certain point would help us to guess what\nwould happen next. There are a great many cases in which we are\npractically certain about the future, e.g., that the sun will rise\nto-morrow morning, or that if we throw a stone up in the air it will\nfall down again. The convenience of this practical certainty is too\nobvious for remark. There are a great many other cases in which we\nare only uncertain of the future for want of knowledge of the\ncircumstances. An extension of the same sort of knowledge we now\npossess would add\u2014it seems that it might go on adding almost\nindefinitely\u2014to our power of predicting the future. But this would\nhold only on the assumption that the same consequences would always\nfollow the same antecedents ; that is, it is only true when we are\ndealing with events that are causally connected.\nChance may be regarded either as a constant interruption of a\nsequence of causally connected events, or\u2014what is the same thing\u2014\nthe breaking up of a long sequence into a number of little short\nseparate sequences, to each one of which the term \" event \" is applied ;\nfor instance, in throwing a pair of dice several times, the whole of\nwhat happens from the beginning of one throw to the beginning\nof the next is called an \" event.\" In a Chance series each \" event \"\nis determined independently of all the others, so that the events\nexercise no influence on one another. The result is that what has\nalready happened gives us no indication whatever of what is likely\nto happen next. We know that it will be one out of several things,\n, because we arbitrarily limit the conditions so that only certain things\ncan happen ; but we cannot possibly tell which of these things will\nhappen.\nAs was said above in contrasting Chance with Design, it is com\nparatively easy to determine whether a long series of events has been\nproduced by Chance or by some cause, but it may often be difficult to\njudge of the origin of a single conjunction of events, or coincidence.\nEven here, however, some principles are available for guidance ; e.g.,\nan exact and detailed agreement or resemblance between two things\nwill suggest a cause for the resemblance, and it may be so detailed\nthat we are practically certain that it is not accidental.\nTheoretically, no degree of complexity and exactness would conclu\nsively prove this. Thus, Dr. Venn remarks, in his Logic of Chance\n(p. 380) :\u2014\" [Suppose that all the letters of the alphabet are contained\nin a bag and that one is drawn at a time from the bag and then\nreplaced.] If the letters were written down one after another as they\noccurred, it would commonly be expected that they would be found to\nmake mere nonsense, and would never arrange themselves into the\nwords of any language known to men. No more they would in\ngeneral, but ... if the process were continued long enough,\n\f174 Alice Johnson.\nwords making sense would appear ; nay more, . . . any book we\nchose to mention,\u2014Milton's Paradise Lost or the plays of Shakespeare,\nf )r example,\u2014would be produced iu this way at last. It would take\nalmost as many days as we have space in this volume to represent in\nfigures, to make tolerably certain of obtaining the former of these\nworks by thus drawing letters out of a bag, but the desired result\nwould be obtained at length.\"\nPractically, however, if we come across a book with the title,\nParadise Lost, we are absolutely certain that its close agreement with\nother books bearing the same title has not been produced accidentally by\nputting together a number of letters taken at random, but is due to\ntheir all being copies of the same original. And a very much lower\ndegree of correspondence in detail may lead to the view that a\ncoincidence of this kind is not accidental. As an illustration, I\ngive the following extract from an article on \"Coincidences\" by\nProfessor Max Miiller in The Fortnightly Review for July, 1896\n(Vol. IX., p. 48). The article relates to some of the resemblances\nbetween Christian and Buddhist writings. Professor Max Miiller\ntells us that the Buddhist Canon was reduced to writing between\n88 and 76 B.C., and he gives several instances of stories in it closely\nresembling some Bible stories, e.g. ;\u2014\nWe read in Jdtaka, 190 (Vol. II., p. 77):\u2014\"One evening, on his way\nto Jetavana, he, the disciple of Buddha, came to the bank of the\nriver Achiravat!, when the ferrymen had pulled up their boats on\nthe shore in order to attend service. As no boat could be seen at\nthe landing-stage and our friend's mind was full of delightful thoughts\nof the Buddha, ho walked into the river. His feet did not sink below\nthe water. He got as far as mid-river, walking as though he were on\ndry land ; but there he noticed the waves. Then his ecstasy subsided and\nhis feet began to sink. Again he strung himself up to high tension and\nwalked on over the water. So he arrived at Jetavana, greeted the Master,\nand took a seat on one side. The Master entered into conversation with\nhim pleasantly. ' I hope, good layman,' said he, ' you had no mishap on\nyour way.' ' Oh, sir,' he replied, 'on my way I was so absorbed in thoughts\nof the Buddha that I set foot upon the river ; but I walked over it as\nthough it had been dry ground ! ' 'Ah, friend layman,' said the Master,\n' you are not the only one who has kept safe by remembering the virtues of\nthe Buddha.' \"\nIn this case the more walking on the water would not startle me so much,\nfor among miracles this is not a very uncommon miracle. But walking on\nthe water by faith, and sinking from want of faith, seems a coincidence\nthat can be accounted for by some historical contact and transference only,\nand in this case we must remember that the date of the Buddhist parable is\nchronologically anterior to the date of the Gospel of St. Luke.\nOne more coincidence and I have done. You all know the parable of\nChrist feeding the five thousand. . . . Well, in the 78th Jataka, as\npointed out to me by Professor Estlin Carpenter, we read of Buddha receiving\n\fXXXV.] 175\nCoincidences.\none cake in his alms-bowl, and after he had fed his five hundred brethren as\nwell as his host and hostess, nay, all the people in the monastery, there were\nstill so many cakes over that they had to be thrown into a cave near the\ngateway.\nHere again, there is, no doubt, some dissimilarity, but the similarity is\nfar stronger, and requires some kind of explanation. We should remember\nthat the Greeks also did not tell their ordinary fables exactly as the Hindus\ndid, nor need the Jatakas of Buddha be the mere copies of the New\nTestament parables, or pice versa. Yet we could hardly deny that commu\nnication and exchange there must have been. The chapter of accidents may\nbe much larger than we imagine, but when we have to deal with fully\nelaborated stories, with tales composed for a moral purpose, we can hardly\nfall back on mere chance.\n. . . It is not enough that these coincidences should be pointed out ;\nthey should be traced to their real source. We have to decide once for all\nwhether we can honestly ascribe them to mere accident, or to our common\nhuman nature, or whether we must ascribe them to some real historical\nintercourse between Buddism and Christianity. If they can be accounted\nfor by our common human nature, let it bo done by pointing out analogous\ncases. If they can be ascribed to mere accident, again I say let us have\nsimilar cases from the chapter of accidents.\nSimilar evidence of a cause for such coincidences is afforded when\nthe resemblances, although not very close, are repeated several times ;\nfor instance, when all the main incidents of a story, though with\nmore or less varying details, are found among several distinct\nraces, like the \"far-travelled tale\" of Jason and Medea, variants\nof which Mr. Andrew Lang has pointed out in Zulu, Gaelic,\nNorse, Malagasy, Russian, Italian and Japanese mythology. He\ngives this (in Custom and Myth) as an instance of a story which\n\" may have been diffused by slow filtration from race to race all over\nthe globe.\" Speaking of the resemblances between myths in general,\nhe remarks {op. cit , Preface, pp. ix.-x.) :\u2014\n\"As a rule, the incidents in Marchen are common to all races;\nan artistic combination of many of these in a plot must probably be\ndue to a single imagination, and the plot must have been diffused in\nthe ways described in Custom and Myth. Independently evolved\nmyths may closely resemble each other when they account for some\nnatural phenomenon, or are based on some common custom. Where-\never a sequence of such incidents is found in a distinct and artistic\nplot, we may provisionally assign diffusion from an original centre\nas that cause. Singular as are the coincidences of fancy, it is unlikely\nthat they ever produced exactly the same tale in lands which have\nnever been in communication with each other. . . . The suggestion\nthat exactly the same plot, in exactly the same shape, and with\nexactly the same incidents, can have been invented by several persons\nindependently, seems to me inconceivable. ... I believe in no\n\f176 [pakt\nAlice Johnson.\nsuch exact coincidences of imagination, though how far precisely\ncoincidence may go is a delicate question.\"\nIt is, of course, possible to attribute a great many of the slighter\ncoincidences met with in folk-lore and other forms of literature to the\nfact that a large proportion of the current stock of ideas in religion,\npoetry, and philosophy are the common property of the human race.\nBut whether any given coincidence of this kind is to be put down to\nthis or some other cause, or to chance, is obviously a question which\nonly scholars can settle.\nChance not the Negation of Law. ,\nMany persons are unwilling to admit the agency of Chance in any\nmatter outside games of chance and the like, because they imagine\nthat this is tantamount to admitting that phenomena may belong to a\nrealm of chaos, and not of law. But more careful investigation shows\nthat it is merely a question of whether they come under the jurisdic\ntion of one set of partiallyknown laws\u2014the laws of Causation, oranother\nset\u2014the laws of Chance. The second set is perhaps even less known,\nand in a certain sense more mysterious, than the first set. Yet there\nare clear traces of some definite method in its operation, and it does not\neven entirely supersede the .first. Chance is not the destruction of Causa\ntion, but merely a peculiar relationship of Causes to one another. The\nprinciple governing it may be described briefly as that of order in the\nmass, combined with disorder in the constituent units of the mass,\nand some of the various features and developments of this principle\nare discussed more fully in the next chapter. Meanwhile, since we\nsometimes find the same characteristics occurring in nature as in the\nchance series produced by art and man's device, the question arises\nwhether to apply the same rules of interpretation to tbem, \u2014the same\ntests for deciding whether a given coincidence or combination of events\nis really produced by a discoverable natural cause, or by an intelligent\nextra-human design, or by chance. When studying an artificial series\nof events we first try to find out if there is anything in it different\nfrom what generally occurs in a chance series. If not, we regard it\nas due to chance, and this method is generally valid, because it is\nvery difficult to simulate a chance series by design. Yet such an\nimitation may be so skilful as to escape detection for a long time (see\nthe account of Monte Carlo roulette below, p. 191 ). If the operation\nof design has been long overlooked at Monte Carlo, afortiori we may\nfail to detect evidence of it in the universe.\nAgain, it has been remarked above that if we only see a single\nevent, or group of events, in an artificial series, we may have reason to\nthink that it was produced by Design, and not by Chance, if there is\nsome one who profits greatly by it. Is it altogether irrational to apply\n\fXXXV.] 177\nCoincidences.\nthe same argument to things that are beyond human control, and to\nmaintain that events making for the special advantage of individuals\nafford some evidence of Design\u2014not conclusive proof, of course, but\nevidence 1\nThe reply is fairly obvious that we do not know what is really and\nultimately for the best advantage of individuals. An optimistic\nphilosophy will hold that everything that happens is for the best ; if\nso, it follows that Design is manifested in everything, not only or\nspecially in certain cases. And this indeed seems the only possible\nphilosophic interpretation of Chance itself\u2014that it is produced by a\nsupreme Design. In our artificial chance series, it is human design\nthat brings the series into existence, while cutting short its own\ninfluence at a certain stage in each event of the series. In the\nuniverse, we can hardly suppose that Design, if it exists at all, can stop\nshort anywhere ; rather we must conceive of it both as producing and\nusing either causally connected groups of events, or chance series of\nevents, at will. All existing entities may be \" Pieces of the Game,\"\nwhich may be in reality a game of skill, and not of chance.\n\f178 [part\nAlice Johnson.\nCHAPTER IL\nGEnerAl DISCUSSION OF CIIANCE.\nThough the word \" Chance \" is one in constant use, there are\nperhaps few terms about which so much real obscurity of thought\nexists ; it may therefore be worth while to discuss it at some length.\nThe difficulty of defining Chance consists in its attributes being\nchiefly negative ; for this reason any general assertions about it often\nfail to convey any precise meaning, unless reference is made to special\ncases in what is called a \" Chance series of events,\" such as throws\nof a penny.\nIn speaking of a Chance series, it must be remembered that what\nwe are considering is an ideal Chance series ; that is, one in which (1)\nthe penny or whatever other object is used is so constructed as to be\nwithout any bias which would cause one side to be uppermost oftener\nthan the other ; and (2) the person tossing it takes care to avoid any\nprocedure which would cause one side to turn up oftener than the\nother. This ideal may never be perfectly attained in any actual\nseries, but it must be assumed in discussing the subject of Chance ;\njust as in geometry the properties of ideal circles and straight lines\nare considered, not such circles and straight lines as are seen in\ndiagrams, however accurately drawn.\nProbability and Expectation.\nIf we say that at any point in a series of throws of a penny, the\nchances of heads or tails turning up are equal, we mean\u2014for one\nthing\u2014that our expectations of them are equal,\u2014that we do not\nexpect one event at all more than the other. The expectation is then\nexpressed numerically by the fraction \\.\nThe first explanation that would occur to us of this state of mind\nwould perhaps be that it was founded on our ignorance, inasmuch as\nwe know of no reason why one side should turn up rather than the\nother. Further consideration shows that it depends rather on our\nknowledge, derived from experience, that the two events occur on the\nwhole equally often.\nExpectation is equivalent to what may be called the subjective\nprobability of the events ; the objective probability having reference\nto what actually happens.\nThe term \"objective probability \" may be applied either to a single\nevent or to a series of events. The objective probability of a single\nevent, say, a head, is always the same, viz., 1 or 0, since a head must\n\fXXXV.] 179\nCoincidences.\neither turn up or not. The expectation of a single event can never\ncorrespond to its objective probability, since we cannot confidently\nexpect either a head or a tail. The expectation is therefore a fraction,\n\u2014in this case\nWhen we speak of objective probability with reference to a series\nof events, we mean the comparative frequency with which the various\nevents occur. Having found by experience what this has been in a\nlarge number of series, we draw the inference that it is likely to be\nthe same in future series of the same kind. In this case, subjective\nprobability (or expectation) may correspond more or less closely with\nobjective probability (or comparative frequency) : in throwing a coin,\nthe expectation of a head is which is what its comparative\nfrequency has been in a very large number of previous cases. The\nexpectation, therefore,\u2014unlike the objective probability,\u2014is the same\nin the single event as in the series, since it is founded solely on\nexperience of the series.\nThe expectation depends on the assumption that the series under\nconsideration is essentially similar in all respects to the series of\nprevious experience. If we know that it is similar in some respects,\nbut not in all,\u2014without knowing exactly in what the difference con\nsists,\u2014we can only found our expectation on what we know,\u2014namely,\nthe similarity, as far as it goes. Thus, supposing that the penny used\nin our series has a decided bias, from being made unsymmetrically, or\nthat the person throwing it has a decided tendency to throw in a certain\nway, one side would be likely to turn up oftener than the other. We\nmight know that there was a decided bias from one or other of these\ncauses ; but, unless we knew which way the bias tended, we should\nhave no more reason for expecting one side than the other, so that our\nexpectation of heads or tails would still be \\. But the objective\nprobability (or comparative frequency) would of course be different.\nNow, in each individual event of any series, there always must\nbe a bias, that is, the forces tending to make one side turn up must\nbe stronger than those tending to make the other side turn up, or else\nneither side would turn up ; that is, the objective probability of the\nsingle event, as already remarked, is 1 or 0. The ideal chance series\nmay be described as one in which there is a bias, but the bias varies\nfrom moment to moment, and what we expect is very much the same on\nthe whole as what happens.\nThe same equality of expectation and objective probability is found\nin series where there is a constant bias, provided we know enough about\nit to be able to estimate its effects numerically. Thus, suppose we have\na bag containing 75 white balls and 25 black ones, and draw out a ball\nwithout having seen it a number of times (putting it back after each\ndraw). We should then expect to draw a white ball three times as\n\f180 [part\nAlice Johnson.\noften as a black one, and both the expectation and the probability of\na white ball being drawn can be expressed by the fraction ^. This\nis, of course, a mere extension of exactly the same sort of condition as\nthat in which the chances of the two events are equal.\nBut if there were a constant bias of whose nature, or even of\nwhose existence, we were ignorant, expectation and objective pro\nbability would no longer be equal, but might diverge greatly ; the\nresults expected might be very different from those that actually\noccurred. In trying to estimate what those results were likely\nto be, we could, of course, only go by what we knew ; our estimate\nwould represent expectation, not probability ; and it would be the\ndivergence found between the expected and the actual results that\nwould reveal the bias to us.\nSo far, I have spoken of expectation that is founded on purely\nrational grounds, on inference from known matters of fact\u2014not neces\nsarily what people do expect, but what they should expect. In the\nordinary affairs of life, we are, of course, guided by many other influ\nences besides reason in forming expectations; emotions, such as desire\nand fear, play a large part in producing them. Thus the divergence\nbetween what we expect and what happens is due not only to our\nignorance, but to a varied complication of causes. For instance, if a\nman himself or some one in whom he is greatly interested is in danger,\n\u2014say, in a battle,\u2014his expectation of a fatal result may be much\ngreater than would be warranted by a calculation of the actual pro\nportion of persons killed out of all those who had taken part in the\nbattle (which would give roughly the rational basis for expectation\nthat any particular person should be killed). Similarly, there is a\ncase in my possession of a veridical dream about a shipwreck (which I\nhave been obliged to omit for want of space, but which will, I hope, lye\nprinted soon in the Journal S.P.R.) in which the narrator, apparently\nthrough his emotional interest in the story, calculates the chance of\nsurvival after shipwreck as being almost infinitesimal ; whereas if he\nhad considered the actual number of survivors, say, of all the ship\nwrecks that had occurred during the present century, the chance\nwould, I think, have appeared very much greater.\nIn judging of the origin of some kinds of coincidences, however,\nexpectation is the more important consideration, because it may have\nsome causal efficacy in producing them. If, e.g., we are discussing\nwhether an apparition seen at the time of death was produced by\ntelepathy or by anxiety about the person seen, it is important to know,\nnot so much whether there was reason for expectation that the person\nwould die, but what degree of emotional interest the seer took in him,\nand the extent to which he was likely to allow this to influence his\nexpectation.\n\fXXXV.] 181\nCoincidences.\nThe Relation of Events in a Chance Series to one another.\nIf we have two ideal chance series, produced, say, by two persons,\nA and B, tossing pennies simultaneously, it is obvious that the two\nseries do not affect one another in any way, so that if A's penny turns\nup a head at the same time as B's, the coincidence is not due to any\ninfluence of the throws on one another, but is accidental,\u2014due to\nChance. In other words, it was not caused by anything. In saying\nthat nothing caused the coincidence, I do not, of course, mean that\nnothing caused the coinciding events. We do not know exactly what\nmade the penny turn up a head in either case, but we know it was\nsome definite cause in both cases. Given all the conditions,\u2014the\nresistance of the air, the smoothness of the surface it fell on, the\nparticular way it was thrown, and so on,\u2014the result of the throw was\ndefinitely determined from the instant the penny left the thrower's\nhand, or perhaps a little earlier. The point is that the chain of\ncausation breaks off completely at the end of each throw or event,\nand begins entirely afresh at the next one, so that what is true of the\nrelation of the events in the two series to one another is equally true\nof the relation of the events in each series to one another. The whole\nof each series is like a number of \" broken arcs \" to which there is no\ncorresponding \" perfect round,\" since the breaches are absolute.\nSince there is no causal connection between the events, it makes no\ndifference whether they occur simultaneously or successively. Further,\ntheir order can be changed in any way we like\u2014provided it is done on\nsome arbitrary principle, irrespective of the nature of the events,\u2014\nand the nature of the series will remain unaltered. Thus, we might\ntake them in the reverse order, or reverse the order of each successive\npair of events, or of every alternate pair ; we might omit every other\nevent, or every third event, without changing the nature of the series,\nif it were a sufficiently long one. If, however, we began to change the\nseries with reference to the nature of the events, we should at once\nintroduce a fresh element. Thus, if we omitted every fifth head, or\nchanged every tail coming after a succession of three tails into a head,\nthe series would no longer be a Chance series, but one produced, or at\nleast affected, by Design. Conversely, if, in a long series, we find any\nprinciple of arrangement recurring much oftener than would be likely\nby chance alone (the probability of such recurrence can, of course, be\nestimated precisely) we suspect, with more or less confidence, that the\nseries is not due to Chance only, but to Design. A mere omission of\nan improbable event may lead to suspicion if continued long enough.\nFor instance, if we went on tossing a penny 20,000 times and never\ngot more than six heads or six tails running, we should know that\nthere was some special cause at work, preventing a longer succession.\n\f182 [part\nAlice Johnson.\nSomething very much like this has been discovered by Professor Karl\nPearson in the case of Monte Carlo roulette (see p. 191).\nAnother result of the fact that events in a Chance series have no\ninfluence on one another is that, if all the events are equally probable,\nany set of events is as likely to occur as any other set of the same\nlength. For instance, a hand of thirteen trumps (as mentioned\nabove) is as likely as any other specified hand at whist. Or, again,\nin twelve throws of a penny we are as likely to get twelve heads as\nto get (1) six heads followed by six tails, or (2) heads and tails\nalternately. There is, I think, a real practical difficulty in grasping\nthis idea, which seems to me to arise from failing to realise that the\nwhole twelve throws are being considered in each case. We know\nthat six heads running is more likely than twelve heads running, and\nthat one head followed by one tail is more probable still ; also that in\ntwelve throws we are much more likely to get some tails than no tails.\nAll these facts seem at first sight inconsistent with the statement that\ntwelve heads running is as likely as the other two cases given. But\nthe twelve heads are to be compared not to six heads, but to six heads\nfollowed by six tails ; and not to one head followed by one tail, but to\nsix such successive pairs of events.\nThe probability of any set of events depends merely on the number\nof possible alternatives (supposing that all are equally probable) and\nthe number of events in the set, and has nothing to do with the\nnature of the events. It is expressed by the following formula : If a\nbe the number of possible alternatives, the probability of occurrence of\nany events, n in number, in any order we choose to specify, is\nSince in questions of pure probability, it does not, as already\nremarked, make any difference whether we are referring to events\noccurring simultaneously or successively, or to events past, present, or\nfuture\u2014so long as we are equally ignorant of all of them\u2014the formula\ncan be applied equally well in psychical research to cases of prediction,\nclairvoyance or telepathy, or retrocognition. It shows the degree to\nwhich such cases become more valuable as evidence of something\nbeyond chance in proportion to (1) their complexity, that is, the\nnumber of simple events involved in the perception ; and (2) the rarity\nof the events, that is, the number of possible alternative events that\nmight have occurred.1\nSo stated, the remark sounds sufficiently obvious. But one fact\nin connection with it is sometimes overlooked, namely, that it applies\nonly to events that have no causal connection with one another. Most\nof the events of ordinary life are causally connected, each event being\n1 Assuming that all the alternatives ate equally probable. If not, a rather more\ncomplicated formula has to be used.\n\fXXXV.] 183\nCoincidences.\ninfluenced by what has gone before and exercising influence on what\nfollows, and it is to such events that spontaneous cases of apparently\nsupernormal perception generally relate. For instance, crystal visions\nof facts unknown to the seer are generally of this kind, and it is im\npossible to say in these cases how large a part is played by inference\nin elaborating the details of the perception, though of course there\nmust be some basis of perception for inference to work on. On the\nother hand, in successful experiments dealing with the events in a\nchance series (e.g., experiments in guessing cards or numbers) it is not\nnecessary to allow anything for the action of inference. For this\nreason, such experiments afford more satisfactory proof of supernormal\npower than spontaneous cases. Incidentally, they possess the further\nadvantage that the degree of probability of success in them is not a\nmatter that admits of difference of opinion, even though it may not be\neasy to determine what degree of success justifies the conclusion that\nsomething beyond chance is producing it,.\nTo the above argument it may be objected that we cannot exclude\nthe action of inference from any mental process whatever. In guess\ning a number of playing cards, say, drawn from a pack at random, and\nnot seen by any one, the person guessing cannot affirm that each guess\nis uninfluenced by the previous ones. Apart from the \"mental habits\"\nleading him more or less unconsciously to prefer certain cards to\nothers, he can hardly help forming some expectations based on previous\nresults, as that a card once drawn will not recur for a little time.\nInference probably guides him to a certain extent in making guesses.\nBut the point is that inference is just as likely to guide him wrong as\nright, because\u2014in a truly chance series\u2014there are no rational grounds\nfor drawing inferences. The action of inference cannot, therefore, in\nthe long run add to the number of his successful guesses, which\nconsequently need not be discounted on this account.\nOn the other hand, in considering events that are causally con\nnected, there always are, from the nature of the case, rational grounds\nfor inferring from one event something about another one, and infer\nence is then likely to lead us right oftener than wrong on the whole.\nThe Aggregate Results of Chance Series.\nSo far we have considered the relation between individual events in\na Chance series and the consequences that follow from the absence of\nall causal connection between them. One of these consequences is the\nimpossibility of predicting what is going to happen in the case of any\none event. It would seem that no extension of knowledge about the\ncircumstances and conditions of the events would give us any help in\nthis ; an extension of the ordinary human faculties would seem to be\nrequired for it.\no\n\f184 [part\nAlice Johnson.\nBut the most interesting and important feature in a Chance series,\n\u2014the point at which the attributes of Chance cease to be exclusively\nnegative\u2014is that absolute uncertainty about individual events is com\nbined with practical certainty as to the general characteristics of the\nseries, if a sufficiently long one be taken. Experience shows that the\nlonger we make the series, the nearer will the results approximate to\nthe theoretically \" most probable \" results. This fact is so familar\nthat one may easily fail to see how remarkable it is that out of the not\nonly apparent but real disorder of the single events arise, as if by a\nsort of spontaneous generation, the order and regularity of the series\ntaken as a whole.\nThe accompanying diagrams, for which I am indebted to my\nbrother, Mr. W. E. Johnson, may serve to illustrate this point.\nFigure 1 shows a short series\u2014100 throws of a penny\u2014recorded by a\ngraphic method on paper ruled in small squares.\nThe throws are represented by the thick zigzag line drawn along\nthe sides of the squares, the length of one side of a square representing\none throw. At every change in the series to h^ads or tails (which,\nfor the remainder of this chapter I will call, for brevity, H or T) the\nzigzag line turns respectively to the right or left. It starts at the\npoint A, which is one end of a straight line, AB, drawn diagonally\nthrough the squares, and the first turn being to the right of this\nstraight line indicates that the series began with an H.\nAny point where the zigzag touches the diagonal line indicates an\nepoch in the series at which the numbers of H's and T's are exactly\nequal ; the diagonal representing, in fact, the most probable result\ntheoretically. The zigzag being on the right of the diagonal at any\npoint indicates an excess of H's at that point, while its being on the\nleft indicates an excess of T's. The exact difference in number of\nH's and T's at any point can be measured by a straight line drawn\nfrom the point in question on the zigzag line to the line AB, the\nstraight line being drawn either in continuation of the zigzag line or\nat right angles to it, and the number of squares along which it passe*\nshowing the excess of H's or T's over each other. Thus, at the point\nC in the series, the dotted line drawn from C (either in continuation\nof or at right angles to the zigzag) passes along four squares before it\nreaches the diagonal line AB, showing that at the point C, four more\nH's than T's had been thrown. Further on, at the point D, the T's\nhad amounted to three more than the H's.\nThe diagram is like a view of an object seen under a microscope,\nthe individual features being brought into great prominence, so that\nthe more general aspects are masked. The irregularity and disorder of\nthe separate throws are strongly marked, while the general tendency to\nequality of H's and T's is only very faintly and dubiously indicated.\n\f\f186 [part\nAlice Johnson.\nFigure 2 represents in a similar manner the general results of\nconsiderably longer series, ignoring altogether the individual results,\nand the difference in appearance is very striking. The diagrams (a)\nand (b) record two series of 1,000 and 4,000 throws respectively. The\nideal or most probable result\u2014equality in number of H's and T's\u2014is\nrepresented in both by the thick vertical straight line, while the zigzag\nshows the actual results reached at the end of each hundred in the first\nseries, and at the end of each thousand in the second series, these epochs\nbeing marked by the letters A, B, C, etc. The position of the zigzag\nto the right of the straight line shows excess of H's, and the position\nto its left shows excess of T's \u2014the. vertical distances of the various\npoints, A, B, C, etc., from the straight line being roughly proportional\nto the excess. At the point 0 in diagram (a) equality happens to\nhave been exactly reached, so that the point C lies on the straight\nline. The greatest deviation from equality in this series appears at\nthe point K (at the end of the ninth hundred) when 34 more T's than\nH's had been thrown. At the end of the thousand the excess of T's\nwas 16.\nThe longer the series, the more chance there is for large deviations\nfrom equality ; but it is important to note that the deviations, though\nabsolutely larger, become relatively smaller as the series grows in\nlength. Thus, in Fig. 1, the greatest deviation occurs at the point E,\nwhere there is an excess of 9 H's, or 60 per cent, of the total number\nof throws (15). In Fig. 2 (a), at the point D, the excess of T's over\nH's is 22, or 5-5 per cent, of the total number of throws (400). At K\nthe excess of T's is 34, or 3-8 per cent, of the total number of throws\n(900). At C, in Fig. 2 (b), the excess of H's is 44, or rather less than\n1-5 per cent, of the total (3,000).\nThese deviations from equality might be represented graphically by\nthe angles which lines drawn from the points in question to the\nstarting point of the series would form with the straight line. Such\nangles would obviously tend to become smaller as the series proceeds.1\nIn other words, the zigzag line (representing the actual results of\nexperiments) tends to approximate more and more closely to the\nstraight line (representing the theoretically most probable results).,-\n1 Unless the excess of H's or T's became proportionately larger, in which case we\nshould have strong ground for suspecting a bias\u2014for thinking that the series was\nnot a purely chance one.\n2 This form of diagram might be used statistically to discover the comparative\nfrequency of two alternatives, by recording them as they occurred. An oblique line\njoining the initial point to each successive terminal point would represent with con\ntinually increasing exactness the required ratio of frequency.\nIn any case where the a priori ratio of frequency is known,\u2014as in the example\ngiven in the text,\u2014the oblique line can be drawn beforehand, and the deviations from\nit show the actual results.\n\fXXXV.] 187\nCoincidences.\nMethods of Analysis of Chance Series.\nThese diagrams illustrate the relation of actual to theoretical\nresults in shorter or longer series only with regard to the number of\ntimes each of the two simple alternative events, H and T, occurs.\nWe may further consider different groups or runs of events in the\nsame series, instead of the simple events.\nThere are many different ways in which such series can be\nanalysed into groups of events. The usual method is to record the\nnumber of times different runs of each alternative have occurred, for\ncomparison with the most probable number of times that they would\nhave occurred by theory. Thus Buffon (quoted in De Morgan's\nBudget of Paradoxes, pp. 169 to 171) analysed his series into \"sets\"\nof one alternative, say H. Every time that H is thrown it is called a\n\"set\"; if there are several H's following one another, each is a \" set \"\nof one throw ; if the H is preceded by one or more T's, these form\npart of the same \" set,\" of two or more throws. The \" sets \" may\nthus consist of H, TH, TTH, TTTH, etc., and may be written briefly\nas H, TH, T2 H, T3 H, etc. The following (see Table I.) are the\nresults obtained by Buffon in 2,048 \" sets,\" as given by De Morgan,\ncompared with the most probable results, and with those of a corre\nspondent of De Morgan's whom he calls A.\nTable I.\n\"Sets.\" Most probable\nresults.\nButton's\nresults.

This is\ndone by dividing my whole series into consecutive groups of events,\neach group beginning with an H (which has been preceded by a T)\nand ending with a T (which is followed by an H). Thus HHHTT,\nHT, HHT, HTTT, HHT, are 17 consecutive throws divided into\ngroups, shown by the commas. These groups I call \"cycles,\" because\nthey all begin and end in the same way. The plan involves the\nnecessity of regarding the series as a circular one ; i.e., one in which\nthe end is continuous with the beginning. So that if the series\nactually ended with one or more H's, these would be brought round to\nthe beginning to form the first part of the first cycle. And if it\nactually began with one or more T's, they would be carried round to\nthe end to form the last part of the last cycle.\nTable II. gives a summary of all the cycles in an actual series of\n4,096 ( = 212) 1 throws, the number in each square referring to cycles\nwhich began with the number of H's stated at the beginning of the\nline in which the square is, and ended with the number of T's stated\nat the top of the column in which the square is. Thus, the first line\nshows that a single H (that is, an H preceded and followed by at least\none T) occurred 495 times. (See column headed \"Total Cycles\").\nOn 257 occasions it was followed by a single T; on 121 occasions by\ntwo T's; on 61 occasions by three T,s, and so on. The second line\nshows that the group of two H's (preceded and followed by at least\none T) occurred 262 times, being followed by one T on 137 occasions,\nby two T's on 59 occasions, and so on.\nThe column headed \"Total Cycles\" gives the totals of the different\nruns of H's, while the bottom line gives the totals of the different\nruns of T's. The column headed \"Total Throws\" gives the total\nnumbers of throws corresponding to the total numbers of cycles.\nThis is, of course, a simple matter of calculation. Thus, taking, e.g.,\nthe second line from the top, the first square gives a number of\ncycles consisting of three throws each, the second square a number of\ncycles of four throws each, and so on.\n1 The series was stopped when thisnumber was reached for convenience in calculat\ning the theoretical or most probable numbers, some of which would be fractional if\nthe total number of events in the series was other than some power of 2.\n\fxxxv.] Coincidences. 1.S9\nTable II.\nT, Ts T3 T, T6 T\u201e T7 T8 T\u201e T10 Total\nCycles\nTotal\nThrows\n257\n?56 121\n128 61\n04 24\n32 15 8\n8 9 495 1459\n76 4 * 7 1 \u2014 \u2014 512 1535\n128 59\n64 29\na* 9\n17 6 2\n7\n1\n1\n2 \u2014 262\nH2 137 \u2014 K\u00bb6S\n16 8 \u2014 1023\n64 26\n32 15 8\n8 5\n*\n1 1 o\n1\n\u2014 121\n128\n609\nH3 63\n24\n16 g 7 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 639\n33 76 13 2 3 1 1\n1\n04 464\nH4 # 7\ni t\n383\n76 6 2\ng\n1\n7 3\n1\n207\nH3 12 4\n\u2014\n\u2014 28\nH0 5 6 1 1 13 102\n4 Q 7 1 16 127\n4 2 2\n1\nH7 6\n1\n10 88\n77\nHs 2\n7 1\n1 3 34\ng 39\nH, 1\n1 1 12\n1 21\nHio 2\n1\n2\n7\n22\n77\nH\u201e\n\u2014 1 1 13\nH\u201e 1 7\nH13\nB.\n.',50 125\n1\n64 41\n55 19 1 1 5\n4\n2 2\n7\n1 18\nTotals 517\n57* ,24.-.\n\/ .,N 48 76 S\n1 \u2014 7 1014\n7tt?4\n409(1\n4090\nFigures in ordinary type show actual results.\nItalic figures show theoretical or most probable results.\nFigures in thick type show \"residual cycles,\" see p. 190.\nTotal H 2057\nTotal T 2039\nTotal number of throws ... 4096\n\f190 [part\nAlice Johnson.\nThe convenience of this method is that, in a series composed of only\ntwo alternative simple events,\u2014the probability of occurrence of each\nof which is one-half,\u2014we are able to show in a single Table the occur\nrence of a number of compound events (each made up of two or more\nsimple events) of varying degrees of probability, and to compare actual\nresults in regard to all these events, \u2014both simple and compound,\u2014,\nwith the theoretical or most probable results. The latter are given\nin each square of the Table in italic figures, below the figures in\nordinary type, which give the actual results. (For the method of\ncalculation by which the theoretical numbers are obtained, see\nAppendix I., p. 293.)\nThis Table is a further illustration of the fact that the longer the\nseries, the smaller in proportion become the deviations from theory. In\na series of 997 throws, which formed part of the large total series of\n4,096 throws, the cycles of H T were 8 per cent, in excess of their\nmost probable number, whereas in the total series, as seen in the Table,\nthey are about 0 4 per cent, in excess of the same.\nBut\u2014and this is an equally important point \u2014 this closer corre\nspondence with theory is only found in the case of events having a\ncomparatively large probability. Even in the next longer cycles\u2014 those\ncontaining three events,\u2014viz., H2 T and H T2,\u2014the deviations from\nthe most probable numbers are 5 per cent, and 7 per cent, respectively\n(in the shorter series just referred to, they were 13 per cent). In the\ncycles of four events, the deviations range from 1\"6 per cent, to 7,8\nper cent, and in those of five events from 3 per cent, to 25 per cent.,\nand in still longer cycles, the deviations amount often to 100 percent,\nor more.\nAnother feature which is rather surprising at first sight is the\nexact correspondence with theory of some among the very long cycles,\ne.g., H T,., H3 T4, H6 T3, H7 T2. It will, however, be seen on consider\nation that, though the relative deviation from probability in the case of\nthese very long cycles is likely to be often great, the absolute deviation\nis likely to be almost always small, so that there is really a greater\nchance of such exact correspondences occurring than in the case of the\nshorter cycles.\n\" Residual Cycles.\"\nThere is one further point to which attention may be drawn. On\nBuffon's method of analysis of 2,048 \"sets,\" the longest \"set\" which\nis likely to occur as often as once is T10 H. But if we add up the\nmost probable numbers of this and of all the shorter sets, the total\ncomes to one less than 2,018. It is, therefore, necessary for one of\nthe longer sets to occur to make up the total. Now the most probable\nnumber of any longer set is a fractional number, less than unity.\n\fXXXV.] 191\nCoincidences.\nBut as no case can occur a fractional number of times, it is assumed\nthat one of the longer sets will most probably occur once. The choice\nin Table I. of T13 H as the most probable one is arbitrary, though\nwe should naturally expect one not very much longer than T10 H.\nIf a similar series of 4,096 throws be analysed into \" cycles,\" and\nwe add up all the cycles the theoretical number of which amounts\nto one or more, we find that they fall short of the theoretical total by\n11 cycles \u2014corresponding to the single \"set\" left over on Buffon's\nplan. These I call \" residual cycles.\" We have, therefore, to fill up\nthe Table by putting in 11 longer cycles (see the figures in thick type),\nthe most probable number of each of which is really a fraction less\nthan unity. Their position in the Table (like the position of Buffon's\nextra \" set \") has to be settled in an arbitrary manner, and the\nparticular position chosen in Table II. must be understood to be\nnot more probable than several others. But the \" residual cycles \"\nmust lie within certain definite and assignable limits, which are\nexplained in Appendix I., with a fuller discussion of the whole\nsubject. It is only necessary to remark here that while, on Buffon's\nmethod, there is always one set left over,\u2014whatever the length of\nthe whole series may be,\u2014the number of \" residual cycles \" varies\nwith the length of the series, increasing absolutely, but decreasing\nrelatively with it.\nBy taking into consideration, therefore, more complicated groups\nof events\u2014\" cycles \" instead of \"sets\"\u2014we find that the theoretical\ndistribution involves the necessity of occurrence of a considerable\nnumber of groups, each of which, taken alone, should theoretically\noccur only a fractional number of times. In other words, these are\ngroups which in longer series would be expected to occur only once\neach.\nIf, then, we were trying to judge whether there was evidence of\nany agency beyond chance in an actual series of this kind, we should\nhave to be very cautious in drawing conclusions from these apparently\nremarkable occurrences, unless they were very numerous. We should\nbe on much safer ground in dealing only with the deviations from\nthe theoretical results shown by the shorter cycles. Similarly, a\nfew extraordinary coincidences, though much more striking to the\nimagination, afford much less reliable evidence of something beyond\nchance than a large number of trivial ones all pointing in the same\ndirection.\nAs an instructive illustration of this point, I may refer to Professor\nKarl Pearson's investigation of the published results of two months'\nroulette playing at Monte Carlo (Essay on \" The Scientific Aspect of\nMonte Carlo Roulette,\" in The Chances of Death and other Studies in\nEvolution, Vol. I., pp. 51 to 57). The total number of trials examined\n\f192 [part\nAlice Johnson.\nwas over 32,000, with some very curious and anomalous results, which\nmay be briefly stated as follows : \u2014\n(1) In the 32,000 and odd trials, the total numbers of rouge and\nnoir results were about what they should have been by chance.\n(2) In a series of 4,052 throws, the runs of odd and even numbers\n(i.e., among the numbers 0 to 36 which mark the 37 compartments of\nthe roulette table) were also \"obedient to the laws of chance.\"\n(3) In a series of 16,563 throws examined to find how frequently\neach of the 37 numbers occurred, (all the 37 numbers should, of course,\nhave occurred about the same number of times), the deviations from\nthe most probable results were in some cases enormously greater than\nwould have been expected theoretically.\n(4) Even greater divergences from the most probable results were\nfound in the case of runs of the two colours. The omission of the\nnumber zero (which is black) from the calculations made the chances of\nred or black in the remaining 36 numbers equal, so that the chances of\nruns of red and black were equivalent to those of runs of heads and tails\nin tossing a coin. Calling a \" set \" the number of throws of the\nroulette ball till a change of colour comes, in 4,274 \"sets \" (resulting\nfrom 8,178 throws of the ball in one fortnight), the \"sets\" of one\nwere found to be enormously more frequent than they should have\nbeen, and the \" sets \" of two, three, and four enormously less so.\nThe writer sums it up by saying (p. 57) : \" Short runs are deficient,\nand the colour changes much more frequently than the laws of chance\nprescribe \" ; and he observes (p. 55) : \" If Monte Carlo roulette had\ngone on since the beginning of geological time on this earth, we\nshould not have expected such an occurrence as this fortnight's play\nto have occurred once on the supposition that the game is one of\nchance.\" These remarkable results were still further confirmed by\nindependent investigations of the play of two more fortnights taken\nseparately, and Professor Pearson remarks, after describing the last\nof them (p. 55) : \" That one such fortnight of runs should have\noccurred in the year 1892 might be looked upon as a veritable\nmiracle ; that three should have occurred is absolutely conclusive.\nRoulette as played at Monte Carlo is not a scientific game of chance.\"\n\fXXXV.] 193\nCoincidences.\nCHAPTER III.\nEXAMPlES.\nSection I.\nCoincidences clearly due to Chance.\nAn artificial Chance Series, such as a number of throws of a coin,\nis in many respects so unlike the events of our ordinary existence that\nit might be supposed impossible that any analogy could exist between\ncoincidences occurring in the former case and those occurring in the\nlatter.\nYet, from a certain superficial point of view, the whole existence of\neach individual may be compared with a single \" event \" in a Chance\nSeries, the successive stages of the existence\u2014like the successive\npositions of a coin during a single throw\u2014being causally connected\ntogether, while a sort of definite break occurs at the beginning and end\nof the life, as at the beginning and end of the throw. Further, the\nvarious positions of the coin are produced by the interaction of several\nforces or causes, and so are the various stages in the man's life. We\nmay, if we choose, assume that all these stages are rigidly determined by\nwhat has gone before, and by the conditions surrounding the man at the\nmoment (all of which, in their turn, may be supposed to be determined\nby previous conditions) ; just as we assume that what happens to the\ncoin is the inevitable result of the way it is thrown, etc. In any\ncase, whether we take a strictly deterministic view of the individual's\nactions or not, there is no question but that they are greatly influenced\nby one another,\u2014that causation plays a large part, if not the whole\npart, in producing them, as in producing the successive positions of\nthe coin during a single throw.\nThe analogy is of course an ancient and familiar one, but if we\nattempt to carry it far, it soon breaks down. A human life is not an\nisolated \"event,\" cut off from all other such events by the two epochs\nof birth and death ; the causal influence is continued into the next\ngeneration and radiates out into the whole of the individual's present\nenvironment, as well as into the future, so that the relation between\ntwo contemporary lives is something quite different from the relation\nbetween two simultaneous chance series.\nThis being so, it might appear at first sight that there could be no\nscope for chance coincidences between the events in two human lives.\nThere are, however, many cases in which two events having some kind\nof agreement with or similarity to one another are brought about by\nentirely independent causes \u2014just as the causes that make two coins\n\f194 [part\nAlice Johnson.\nturn up heads at the same time are entirely independent of one\nanother\u2014and all such coincidences are due to chance.\nThus, if two acquaintances meet in the street, the meeting may be\ndue to chance, or it may not. It is not by chance if they both have\na habit, either from choice or necessity, of going there at that time ;\nor if they are drawn to the spot at the same moment by a common\nattraction, such as a circus passing by. But if they were accustomed\nto go out at various times in various directions, their meeting would\nbe due to chance. The probability of the meeting might, of course,\nbe fairly large ; the times at which they went out and the directions\nthey took would be limited ; and the more similar their tastes were,\nthe narrower would these limits become, and they would consequently\nmeet oftener. In the case of each meeting, we should have to know\nall the circumstances in order to know whether it occurred by chance\nor not. In any case, each of the persons would have had some\nreason for being at the place just then,\u2014some cause would have\nbrought him there, \u2014but if there was no reason why both should\nchoose the same time, the meeting would be accidental.\nWe should hardly, however, call such a meeting a coincidence,\nunless there was some special feature in it that attracted our attention,\n\u2014something that made us ask why it happened ; even though con\nsideration of it might show that there was really no cause for it, that\nis, that it was accidental.\nMy first example is a case of this kind, the point of which consists\nin the meeting of two persons of the same name,\u2014both Christian and\nsurname.\nCase 1.\nThe account is taken from Notes and Queries, 5th Series, Vol. XII.,\np. Ill, August 9th, 1879, the writer being the Rev. C. W. Bingham.\nAnother coincidence recorded by him is given below on p. 261.\n. . . Till within the last few years, the Clergy List contained the name\nof a highly respected clergyman, in no wise related to me, but bearing and\ncalled by the same first Christian name as myself. We had been introduced\nto each other, but had had no opportunity of cultivating each other's\nacquaintance. It chanced that in 1867 I was visiting the Paris Exposition,\nand passing one morning through the building, my attention was arrested\nby the kind of trophy of Bibles which was raised in the centre of one of the\nalleys by the British and Foreign Bible Society. On the opposite side\nstood an English gentleman, who was engaged in a similar survey, and as\nour eyes fell from the object of our gaze, they met each other and a slight\nsmile of recognition gradually lighted up both our countenances. We advanced\ntowards each other and shook hands, but it was obvious from his manner\nthat we were in precisely the same case\u2014were aware that we had met else\nwhere, but had no recollection whatever as to who we respectively were.\n\fXXXV.] 195\nCoincidences.\n\"I beg your pardon,\" was our common exclamation, \" but I cannot at this\nmoment remember your name.\" I forget which was the 6rst to reply, but\nthe answer was identical : \" My name is the Rev. Charles Bingham,\" and\n\"My name is the Rev. Charles Bingham.\" . . .\nC. W. Bingham.\nIn this episode there are several different conjunctions of events\nwhose antecedent probability might be estimated, and I give the story\npartly because it illustrates the difficulty of disentangling among a\nmass of incidents the salient ones for the present purpose. For this,\nI think the only important point, as already indicated, is the meeting\nof two persons of the same name. As in other analogous cases (e.g.,\nthe case of thirteen trumps in a hand at whist) this conjunction of\nevents, as far as its antecedent probability can be calculated, is no\nmore unlikely than any other similar conjunction. It is not more\nunlikely for two specified persons of the same name to meet than for\ntwo specified persons of different names. The only point that could\naffect the calculation would be the question of how common the name\nwas. The account implies that there were only two English clergymen\nthen living of the name of Charles Bingham. Crockford's Clerical\nDirectory for 1898 gives seven clergymen of the name of Bingham,\namong whom is one Charles Bingham. If the name were a very\ncommon one, it would, of course, increase the probability of the\nmeeting of some two persons of that name (though it would not\nincrease the probability of the meeting of two particular individuals\nof that name). Evidently the particular point in the incident that\nstruck the persons concerned was their both giving the same answer\nto the same question. But the case depends, I think, as to its ante\ncedent probability, on nothing else than the rarity of the combination\nof the Christian and surnames.\nThe next is a case of a remarkable resemblance between a real\nand a fictitious individual.\nCask 2.\nThe account is a reproduction of an article called \" A Remarkable\nCoincidence ;\u2014Letter from Dr. George M.

He had\ntwo brothers, James and George. The former some years ago went to\nCalifornia, and the latter, I understand, resides somewhere in Kansas.\n\"This John Nasium seems to have been the black sheep of the family,\nand when he left New York, he did not leave a very good record behind him.\nHe went from here to Toledo, Ohio, and afterwards, we hear, he went to\nTecumseh, Michigan, no doubt thinking that in a quiet country place he\nwould be more secluded than he could be in a city. I and several of my\nfriends would like to get track of him, if it can be done quietly and without\nexciting any suspicion. He may have changed his name and so I will\ndescribe the man as nearly as I can, which may be some help to you. John\nI never knew very well, but his brother Jem, as they called him here, I\nknew very well indeed. John is rather tall, weighing about 180 lbs., I\nshould think. He stoops a little and is slightly lame in the left leg. You\nwould not observe his lameness unless you were to pay particular attention\nto him while walking. His hair is a dark sandy colour, in fact, almost a\nred, and his side-whiskers are almost the same colour, but a little darker.\nHe is about 38 years of age, but really does not look over 30. His eyes are\na very dark brown, and the left eye looks a little peculiar, i.e., unlike the\nother\u2014looks as if, some time or other, a cataract had been removed by an\noperation. To look at him you would at once see a difference in his eyes,\nand yet I cannot describe the difference any better than I have done. While\nhe lived here, he usually wore his hair rather long and carried himself in a\nstyle peculiar to the Southerner.\n\" Now perhaps the best and most prudent way for you to do would be\nfor you to go up and read this letter to Uncle Hiram first. He is a very\ncareful, discreet man, and he can make enquiries and excite less suspicion\nthan you could.\n\" I am real sorry to make you any trouble and much less Uncle Hiram,\nbut this is a matter, if it can be properly done, which may be of considerable\nimportance to me and several of my friends, and perhaps further the ends of\njustice.\n\fXXXV.] 197\nCoincidences.\n\"There is one other mark which may aid you, which ia\u2014this man was in\nthe rebel army, and his forefinger on his left hand was shot off.

In the\ncourse of half-an-hour he came to me, saying that he had just seen my man,\n\u2014with sandy whiskers, rather tall\u2014would weigh 170 or 180 lbs., \u2014wearing\nspecs., and the front finger of the left hand missing ; and was very anxious\nthat he should be immediately arrested, as he was then at the livery stable, for\na saddle-horse to ride away. I told him we had better wait and be sure that\nhe was the one we wanted, and also find out if we could whether you wanted\nhim arrested, should he prove to be the right man. I saw the man and he\nanswered the description so well, even to the finger, that I thought it best to\ntelegraph you for instructions. The marshal, in the mean time, was to keep\nhis eye on him (as he failed to get a horse). Seeing him walk down to\ndinner with one of our townsmen, the first opportunity he made some\nenquiries of this townsman, and found that he was not the man \u2014that he\nwas the cousin of this man that took him to dinner, and was brother to a\nMrs. Palmer, whom he was visiting\u2014that he lives in South Cleveland, Ohio,\nand is a lawyer by profession.\n\" That he answered the description, both in size and the loss of the finger,\nas well as the colour of his whiskers, there could be no doubt. Wearing\nspecs, we supposed was to hide the defects of that eye you mentioned, and\nhe looked as though his side-whiskers had recently been cut or shaved ; but\nif, as we are told, his homo is in Cleveland and his name is Hick, why of\ncourse we were deceived in the matter. And, if his friend has not informed\nhim, he is still ignorant of our suspicions.\n\" Now, as this is my first experience in the detective business, you will\npardon the blunder. Hoping that it has put you to no inconvenience, I\nremain, yours, etc. H Raymond \u00bb\nThe one striking feature of this coincidence is, of course, the loss of the\nforefinger in the left hand.\nBoth the imagined and the real case possessed this very exceptional\npeculiarity. This is a subject on which statistics cannot be gained ; but it\nis certain that in the whole continent not a small roomful could be found\npossessing precisely this deformity at the age specified ; and it may well be\n\f198 [part\nAlice Johnson.\ndoubted whether in the whole world there is another person thus mutilated\nand at the same time possessing all the general physical characteristics of the\nindividual described in the letter.\nMore striking still is the fact that this individual did not reside in the\nplace where the letter was sent (which is not a large place) and was there by\nchance only the day that the letter reached there.\nThose who believe that the mathematical doctrine of chances can solve\nthe complex problems of coincidences will find in this case material for\nconsideration. I may here quote a single sentence from the second of my\nseries of papers on \"Experiments with Living Human Beings,\" in the April\nnumber of the Monthly: \"In these and all studies of a like character it is\nto be recognised that coincidences of the most extraordinary character and\nastonishing nature are liable to occur at any instant, and that they are as\nlikely to occur on the first trial as on the last of a long series.\"\nA second point of great psychological interest in this case is the attempt\nmade by the person to whom the letter was addressed to overlook certain\ndiscrepancies between the imaginary and real individual, and to twist and\npervert and reason upon the facta of the case, so as to bring them into\nharmony with what he was expecting to see. While the man corresponded to\nthe description in size, in the colour of his whiskers and especially in the loss\nof his finger, he did not correspond in the fact that he wore spectacles, and\nhad no side-whiskers. The detective reasoned that he wore spectacles to\nhide the defect in his eye, which defect he did not see ; and he assumed, on\nthought, that the side whiskers had been recently shaved or cut. Nothing\nis said of his stooping, or of his being lame in the left leg, or of the colour of\nhis hair, or of its length.\nThe bearings of this whole history on the delusions of clairvoyance,\nmind-reading, animal magnetism and spiritism are apparent. A successful\ncoincidence of this kind would have made fortune and favour for any\nclairvoyant or medium or mind-reader. \u2014Truly yours.\nGeorge M. Beard.\nNew York, Jidy, 1879.\nIn addition to the comments of Dr. Beard on this case, it may\nbe observed that the greater part of the general description of the\nsupposed individual\u2014apart from the point of the missing finger\u2014 might\nhave fitted very fairly, say, one out of every thirty middle-aged men\nin England or in America. \" He is rather tall\u2014stoops a little\u2014 his hair\nis a dark sandy colour, almost a red, and his side-whiskers are almost\nthe same colour, but a little darker\u2014his eyes are a very dark brown\nand the left eye looks a little unlike the other.\" Finally, \" his nose is\nquite prominent, and he has a very mild and quiet look and is the\nlast man you would pick out for a scoundrel.\" The village of\nTecumseh probably contained several persons like this. But Mr.\nRaymond no doubt knew all his fellow townsmen, at least by sight,\nand it would never occur to him to compare any of them with the\ndescription given. He naturally looked out for the first stranger he\ncould find, and it is not very surprising that the first stranger turned\n\fXXXV.] 199\nCoincidences.\nout to have a general resemblance to the fictitious scoundrel. But it\nis certainly remarkable that in both of them a finger was missing,\u2014\nand that the same finger,\u2014a deformity which, as Dr. Beard says, is\nextremely rare.\nThe next case\u2014of similar incidents occurring in two contemporary\nlives\u2014presents a curiously close analogy to the coincidences that may\noccur between events in two simultaneous artificial chance series. The\naccount was obtained by Dr. Hodgson.\nDr. M. and the undersigned H. W. B. are brothers-in-law. Dr. M. resides\nand practises in London ; H. W. B. lives in a suburb, but is engaged in\nbusiness in the city. In December, 1897, he was temporarily staying with his\nbrother-in-law Dr. M. The undersigned J. T. H., an Australian on a short\nvisit to London, was detained there by illness. He had not previously\nknown Dr. M. or H. W. B., but in November, 1897, he made the acquaintance\nof Dr. M., who, on account of the ill-health of J. T. H, was kind enough to\ninvite him to stay at his house. In December J. T. H. went to stay with\nDr. M., and there for the first time met H. W. B.\nIt transpired in conversation that H.W.B. and J.T.H.\n1. Were both born on May 13th, 1858.\n2. Their christening was in each case delayed until the completion of a\nnew church, one church being in England, the other in Australia.\n3. At that time (December, 1897) they each occupied a house (one in\nEngland, the other in Australia) which house in each case consisted of two\nsmall cottages knocked into one by connecting doorways.\nMr. Hackett is an Associate S.P.R. He is an old friend of mine, and\ngave me the above account orally, and afterwards wrote it out at my\nrequest.\u2014R. Hodgson.\nThe following is a series of trivial coincidences recorded by Miss\nC. Shuttleworth, of 10, Cottesmore-gardens, Kensington, W , who\nwrites that the \" coincidences are all strictly true.\"\n1. On one of the coldest days of the bitter frost in the beginning of 1895\nI went, at about half-past six in the evening, to pay a visit to a near neigh\nbour in London. Two ladies were sitting with her\u2014an aunt and a niece\u2014\nand whilst she talked with the aunt, I had to talk to the niece. When the\ndegrees of cold had been disposed of, I could think of nothing else to say\nto this stranger than to ask if she happened to have read a book which just\nthen had been much interesting me, \"A Colony of Mercy,\" being an account\nof the work of Pastor von Bodelschwingh in Westphalia. \"No,\" she replied,\n\" I have not read it, but I know all about Von Bodelschwingh. I am going\nCase 3.\nLondon, January 21st, 1898.\n[Signed] j\nHerbert Wilfork Brett.\nJ. T.

From a country house, some years ago, we drove over, a large party,\nto some distant ironworks. During our walk round them we had to stand\nfor a while by a little railway waiting for an engine to get out of the way.\nWhilst we did so I asked a man of the party who had only arrived the\nevening before whether he had ever been on an engine. I forget what he\nsaid, but I remember expatiating on the fun of driving one\u2014an accomplish\nment I had lately practised. He seemed confused, and some elderly ladies\nwho were listening looked shocked, which I fear prompted me to enlarge on\nthe topic. On the way back he confided to me that this was the anniversary\nof his wife's death. She had died that day three years. In the evening I\nrepeated this to our hostess, who then told me the cause of her death. It\nappeared that once indeed the poor man had been on an engine and it was\nwith his wife. It had overturned going round a curve, and his wife was\ncrushed to death beneath it.\n3. Many years ago a neighbour was dining with us. He told a story of\nMrs. H., a propos of something that had been said, and stated that he had\nonly once met her, more than thirty years before. I asked if she was now\nLady H., as, if so, she might be identical with a funny old person whom an\nold governess of ours used to tell us about, but whom we had never seen. She\nwas a neighbour of hers in a remote village nearly 300 miles away, and we\nhad heard her speak of her kindness and her eccentricity. She had told us\nthat when walking home in an evening she would often accost a stranger,\nusually a labourer, and saying, \"I am Lady H., I will take your arm,\"\nwould proceed to do so, and thus walk home with him, perhaps a mile or\ntwo. And with this anecdote I capped our friend's. But he could not tell\nus whether she was the same person or not, as he had never heard of his\nMrs. H. again.\nThe next morning, whilst we were at breakfast. Lady H. walked in. She\nhad already paid our friend a visit, having arrived at his house at 8 o'clock.\nShe was his Mrs. H., and having been told he lived in the neighbourhood,\nhad walked a couple of miles over the fields to breakfast with him. The\ntemptation to tell her how we had discussed her the night before was too\nstrong for him, and, alas ! he could not even resist the diabolical suggestion\nto repeat my bit of gossip about the labourer. So she came on to inquire\nhow it had reached us. We never told her, though we spent the morning\nunder cross-examination. But she was pacified with luncheon, and being\nafterwards driven back to the house where she was staying. \" It was quite\ntrue, my. dear,\" she freely admitted ; \" and only last night, whilst you were\ntalking about me, I was walking home from the station arm-in-arm with the\nticket taker. \"\n4. A few years ago my sister asked me as we sat over the fire whether 1\never now heard anything of a Mr. M. I was surprised at the question, as\n\fXXXV.] 201\nCoincidences.\nshe had known him less than I had done, and I had only once seen him, and\nhad never heard from him in about ten years. I was not aware that he\nknew my address. But whilst I was answering her question, he came in.\nHe was living in Cambridge and I in London.\n5. \" Is not ' Seend ' an odd name for a place ? \" a friend once asked me,\nas we sat writing letters in Tyrol, she at one end of a long room, and I at the\nother; \" Yes,\" I said, \"but how in the world did you know?\" \"Know\nirhat? she inquired. \"Why, that I have this instant directed an envelope\n\"there ! \" It then transpired that her uncle had just taken a house in the\nvillage in which a friend of mine was living, but neither of us knew that the\nother had ever heard of the place. q g\nIn reply to a request for corroboration of these incidents, in so far\nas it could be had, Miss Shuttleworth writes to me :\u2014\nJune 22nd [1898].\n. . . My sister, Mrs. Moore, says her recollection of the No. 4\ncoincidence is so vague that it would be no use her saying anything in\ncorroboration. That is to say, she remembers it now I have reminded her\nof it, or thinks she does, but at first could not recall it at all. I find it must\nhave happened in 1886\u2014longer ago than I thought.\nNo. 3 she remembers perfectly. The \" friend\" on whom Lady H. first\ncalled is dead, and none of his family were at home at the time. That was\nwhy he dined with us most evenings.\nMy friend Mrs. Russell, of 9, St. Albans Road, Kensington, has sent\nme the enclosed letter from Iter friend, the \" aunt \" of No. 1. As you will\nsee, she fully corroborates it so far as she goes, though she evidently thinks\nI was requiring information about Von Bodelschwingh's institutions. Her\nniece is in America, but I remember she told me that she was taking Biele\nfeld on her imy to Leipzig, and was to stay there about a fortnight. I have\nnever seen her or her aunt since. The whole of the aunt's letter was not\nsent me, so there is no signature.\nThe smaller enclosed note concerns No. 5. That is all I can do.\u2014Yours\nMiss Shuttleworth's sister, Mrs. Moore, writes :\u2014\nI remember Lady H. suddenly making her appearance under the\nI see on referring to my diary that on January 1st, 1895, 1 and E.

A portion of the present paper,\nincluding her narrative, was read by Dr. Hodgson at a general\nmeeting of the Society for Psychical Research on April 22nd, 1898,\nand the next day he received the following letter :\u2014\nApril 22nd [1898].\nDear Sir,\u2014Having been at the meeting this afternoon, at Westminster\nTown Hall, I write to tell you about a further coincidence in connection\nwith one of the examples recorded by Miss Shuttleworth. The gentleman\nwith whom Miss Shuttleworth spoke upon the subject of driving engines\nwas, I feel almost sure, my father. The lady who lost her balance while\nrounding a corner, and who was killed on the spot, was my mother ! It was\nquite a chance my being at the meeting this afternoon, as I am not a member\nof the Society, and it will probably be the only meeting I shall be able to\nattend this year, as I live altogether in Ireland. On coming back here'this\nafternoon I said to my father, \" Did you ever meet a Miss Shuttleworth ?\"\nand on hearing he had done so, I proceeded to tell him of this afternoon's\nmeeting. He says he remembers having spoken to Miss S. about engines.\nIt would be a satisfaction to discover for certain whether the gentleman in\nquestion was Captain whose wife, Mrs. , was accidentally killed\nfrom a traction engine at in 1869, August 31st.\u2014Yours very truly,\n[Signed] .\nDr. Hodgson asked if Captain would himself furnish a state\nment of- the circumstances, and Miss replied :\u2014\nApril 25th, 1898.\nDear Sir,\u2014I am very curious to know if it was my father to whom Miss\nShuttleworth alluded : Captain (now Lord ).\nI hardly like to ask him to write down a statement ; first of all, because\nhe does not like, even now, speaking of the accident, as he is of a highly\nnervous temperament, and secondly, because his memory is not as good as\nit used to be, but I gather that it was at the house of Mr. , , that\nhe met Miss S., to whom he remembers speaking on the subject of my\nmother's death.\nIt was either in '71 or '72. My mother was on a small traction engine\nbuilt by her cousins, the present Lord and his brothers, and in turning\na corner, she put up her hand to steady her hat, and in so doing, she lost\nher balance and fell off the engine\u2014being killed on the spot.\nI thought it odd the other day that this should be alluded to at the\none meeting of the year at which I happened to be present, and that the\nsubject of the meeting should be \" Coincidences.\"\n\fXXXV.] 203\nCoincidences.\nWe wrote to Miss Shuttleworth to enquire if it was Captain ,\nnow Lord , to whom she had referred in this case, and she replied\nin the affirmative.\nCask 6.\nThe following case was contributed to Light (Vol. X., 1890, p. 371),\nby Mr. C. C. Massey. He says :\u2014\nAt the Boaid meeting of the Brecon and Merthyr Railway 1 last month,\na serious and fatal accident to a train of the Company, owing to a \"wild run\"\ndown the incline at Tallybont, on December 2nd, was reported. At the\nsame meeting also was reported the death, within an hour and a half of the\ntime of the accident, of one Thomas, who had been in receipt of an\nallowance of seven shillings a week from the Company ever since 1867, in\nconsequence of injuries sustained by him in that year from an accident to a\ntrain at the very same spot and from the very same cause.\nIn this case the coincidence of the man's death at the time of the\nsecond accident was clearly due to chance ; but it was not by chance\nthat the two accidents occurred to the train in the same place, since\nthey were due to the same cause.\nOn the other hand, when a somewhat rare event occurs several\ntimes, \u2014 either simultaneously or in rapid succession,\u2014being due to a\ndifferent cause each time, the repetition is an accidental coincidence.\nThe following are instances of this type.\nCase 7.\nIn Time, of September, 1890, (New Series, Vol. II., p. 978),\noccurs an article by Mr. A. W. Holmes-Forbes on \" Contemporary\nCoincidences,\" containing a curious collection of groups of similar\nevents occurring at about the same time in various parts of the world,\n\u2014mostly in England. These are extracted from newspaper reports,\nviz., from the Times, Daily News, Echo, Standard, Daily Telegraph,\nGlobe, and Evening Standard, and are not confirmed in any way, but\none may probably assume that reports of events such as these are\naccurate in the main.\nThe following is a summary of the events reported, with their\ndates:\u2014(1) Fall of buildings, five cases, July 22nd to 24th, 1885;\n(2) burning of churches, five cases, December, 1886, to February, 1889,\ntwo occurring on the same day of February, 1889 ; (3) fall of bridges,\ntwo cases, on September 16th, 1889; (4) theatres burned, three cases,\nJanuary lst-5th, 1838; (5) explosions\u2014mostly serious ones\u2014seven cases,\nOctober 6th to November 30th, 1888 ; (6) burying empty coffins, three\ncases, December 17th to 23rd, 1888; (7) great finds of honey, two\ncases, September, 1888; (8) marriages interrupted, two cases, February,\n1 1 was then a director of that Company and was present.\n\f204 [part\nAlice Johnson.\n1886; (9) women in men's clothes, three cases, March and April,\n1889 ; (10) actions for libel, nineteen cases in the Michaelmas Sittings\nof 1889\u2014all apparently in London; (11) similar robbery of lawyers,\ntwo cases, on August 16th, 1886 ; (12) death in the legal ranks, four\ncases, March, 1883 ; (13) constables in trouble, three cases on August\n20th, 1887, and three on November 30th, 1889 ; (14) riots, six cases,\nJuly 24th-31st, 1885 ; (15) discovery of prehistoric remains, one in the\nUnited States and one near Milan, November, 1889 ; (16) asylums\nburned, two cases (in America), May 8th, 1890.\nThe writer says that these sixteen series are taken from a list of\nmore than 140 similar groups, in some instances more than twelve\nserious accidents of the same kind (other than wrecks) having occurred\nwithin a few days ; and, in conclusion, he observes :\u2014\" Taken all\ntogether the catalogue seems to contain some element beyond that of\nmere coincidence.\" He explains that his collection is merely the result\nof cases taken at random in the course of his ordinary newspaper\nreading, and states, \" We are not coincidence-hunters. Not one\ncoincidence has been the result of searching.\"\nThere is a certain analogy between incidents of this kind and\nrepetitions of the same event in an artificial chance series ; e.g.,\nsuppose, in tossing a coin, the sequence of seven heads followed by\nthree tails occurred twice running. This sequence is likely to occur\ntwice running in a series of 1,048,576 throws. But it is, of course,\nnot more likely to happen at one time than another in the series ;\nso that it might happen during the first hundred throws as well as at\nany other point. Regarded as part of a series of 100 throws, it would\nbe highly improbable that it should occur at all ; while, regarded as\npart of a very long series, it is not improbable.\nNow, there is always something arbitrary about the length of a\nseries to which we choose to assign a certain event or sequence of\nevents. Even if we are considering an actual series of a certain finite\nlength, it is always possible to regard it as part of an imaginary longer\nseries; just as an actual line may be treated geometrically as part of an\nimaginary longer line. The whole conception of the events as consti\ntuting a series is, in fact, an arbitrary one,\u2014-which we adopt for con\nvenience, because this is the only way in which it has been found possible\nto formulate any principles with regard to the events. One of these\nprinciples is that, if we wish to be able to judge whether certain events\nhave actually occurred by chance or not, it is necessary to take an\nactual series so long that the events in question are likely to have\noccurred by chance a good many times in the course of it. The\ngreater the probability of the events, therefore, the more practically\nreliable is any evidence for a cause which depends on the frequency\nof their occurrence. The \" residual cycles \" in the chance series\n\fXXXV.] 205\nCoincidences.\ndescribed in Chapter II., p. 190, afford an instructive illustration of\nthis point. These were sequences of events having a very small\nprobability, and it was shown that their occurrence in the series in\nquestion proved nothing.\nStill less is it possible to draw any conclusion from the repetitions\nof events described by Mr. Holmes-Forbes in the above narrative ;\nfirst, because it is clear that their antecedent probability is com\nparatively small ; and, secondly, because there are no grounds for\njudging what length of series they could reasonably be regarded as\nbelonging to.\nSection II.\nCoincidences toith a doubtful claim to causal production.\n(a) Cases suggestive of \"Design.\"\nIn describing the classification of Coincidences here adopted, I\nreferred to incidents involving an unusual combination of circum\nstances, whose characteristic is that they are specially convenient for\nsome person or persons,\u2014something that would be called particularly\n\"lucky\" for them. The word \" lucky \" implies that the conjunction of\ncircumstances is thought accidental. Yet, if it implies something of\nreal moment to the persons concerned, it can hardly fail to suggest\u2014,\nto them, at least\u2014that it did not come about by chance, nor through\nthe ordinary course of events causally connected together, but was\ndue to a special intervention on their behalf,\u2014a sort of slight bias\ngiven to the circumstances by an overruling Design. There is no\ndoubt that this idea is distinctly suggested by such cases as the last\none I give in this section, and by other cases (not given here) which\nare regarded as answers to prayer.\nI do not, of course, put forward the cases cited, or the comments\nmade on them, as any contribution towards settling the question\nwhether such a special intervention ever really occurs. They are\nintended merely to illustrate the difficulties met with in considering\nthe question. The first of these is that the \" lucky \" incidents are\nsometimes so trivial that it seems absurd to attribute any importance\nto them as evidence of anything ; while there is no obvious point at\nwhich to draw the line between these and the more momentous ones.\nAgain, very \"lucky\" events generally consist in the extrication of\nsomebody from some unpleasant or dangerous situation ; and then the\nevidence for special intervention on his behalf is certainly dubious ;\nsince as much seems to have done against his interests in involving\nhim in trouble, as for him in taking him out of it.\n\f206 [part\nAlice Johnson.\nBoth these considerations would tend to show that what had\nhappened in all the cases supposed was part of the ordinary course of\nevents, and that no special intervention had taken place.\nWe need not, however, hold that Design operates by any kind of\ninterference at the moment, but might rather hold that all events in\nthe universe were pre-arranged by it from the beginning. The only\nessential feature in the conception is that things are, in one way or\nanother, arranged with some purpose\u2014some end in view. We can\nhardly in any case suppose that Design is only, or chiefly, concerned\nwith \" lucky \" or \" unlucky \" events. If we believe in it at all, we can\nhardly help believing that it takes cognisance of everything that\noccurs. But it might easily happen that only a certain number of all\nthe events that occur were what mightbe called \" evidential \" of Design,\njust as believers in telepathy generally hold that it occurs frequently,\nbut only now and then in a manner susceptible of proof.\nIt is these apparently \" evidential \" cases that may be instructively\ncompared with the events that afford evidence of human design.\nIf some one wins by cheating in a game of chance, the fact\nof the results being specially fortunate for him may, under some\ncircumstances, lead us to guess that he is cheating. Similarly, when\ncircumstances beyond human control concur in an unusual manner to\nproduce some great benefit to a human being, this may suggest to us\nthat a superhuman Design is working for the benefit of that person.\nIn the case of the fraudulent player, we might find conclusive\nproof through detecting the agency at work,\u2014a kind of evidence which\nwe can hardly conceive of obtaining in the other case. But we might\nalso find evidence of what the fraudulent player was doing by observing\nthat in a very large number of instances, the results of the game\ndiffered from what would be expected to occur by chance. This would\nonly make it more or less probable that some cause, not chance, was\nacting, and a very large number of instances would be necessary for\npractical certainty. Even then we should have to investigate further\nto discover what the cause was.\nThe consideration of games of chance and the like has no very\ndirect bearing ou the question of the existence of a superhuman\nDesign. But without some knowledge of what can be, and in fact\nconstantly is, produced by chance in such cases, we should hardly\nbe able to realise what a multitude of incidents,\u2014incidents either\nspecially \"lucky\" or specially \"unlucky\" for some individuals\u2014might\noccur by chance alone, and this ought to make us very cautious in\nattempting to found arguments on any particular instances.\nThere are other kinds of Coincidences which, on somewhat different\ngrounds, are occasionally regarded as indicative of Design in the\n\fXXXV.] 207\nCoincidences.\nuniverse ;\u2014namely, coincidences in which events of a certain order\nseem susceptible of a special interpretation having relation to other\n,events, apparently unconnected with them and of an entirely distinct\n\u2022order. It has been a favourite idea of mystics in all ages that most\n,events are symbolic of something else, which can be discovered\n,through the use of a sort of hypothetical cipher,\u2014the great object of\n,ambition being to find out the universal cipher that will fit every\nthing, and in the light of which everything would seem, as it were,\nto make sense.\nThe cipher must be supposed sometimes to take a very simple form,\nsuch as the famous anagram: Horatio Kelson = Honor est a Nilo.\nHere it would have to be supposed that Nelson,s parents were guided\nto give him the name in a spirit of unconscious prophecy. But the\npractical certainty that the coincidence was accidental is shown by\nthe fact, which any one can verify for himself, that there is little\ndifficulty in making more or less appropriate anagrams out of almost\nAny names, since most of them contain a fair proportion of vowels and\nthe common consonants, while the very large number of incidents in\nany one life afford unlimited scope for choice of words to compose\nthe anagram.\nIn many instances some special significance has been attached to\ncertain numbers as portents, the numbers having attracted attention\nfor some reason ; for instance (as in the case of Mr Massey and the\nnumber 99, given below), on account of their being associated several\ntimes with similar events. Or in some cases the same number is\nproduced repeatedly in several different ways, e.g., in adding up the\ndigits of different dates, chosen for some reason irrespective of the\nnumbers. (See Case 10, below.) The histories of all religions are full\n,of this tendency to attach special significance to all kinds of objects or\nincidents which have been supposed to give information or super\nnatural guidance.\nAstrology and Palmistry form some of the best known historical\ninstances of this. The ancient astrology of course involved, and was\nto a great extent based on, the belief that the earth was in all respects\nthe centre of creation, so that there seemed to be nothing unreasonable\nin the idea that one of the main functions of the stars was to record\nits history or to guide men in their affairs. Apart from this obsolete\nbelief, the theory depended for its philosophic basis on the notion of a\npre-existing (or co-existing) coherence of all phenomena,\u2014the universe\n\u2022being regarded as a continuous structure, every part of which depended\non, or was determined by, the rest, and might therefore be supposed to\n\u2022explain the rest. On this assumption, the universe as a whole might be\n,empirically recognisable in the relative positions of stars, or the flights\n,of birds, -or the lines in a human hand or anything else ; complete\n\f208 [part\nAlice Johnson.\nknowledge of any one portion of the universe both requiring and\ninvolving complete knowledge of all the rest of it.\nThis main principle is not only generally accepted in the present\nday as an axiom of science, but is formulated in a much more precise\nmanner than formerly. But it is difficult to realise exactly what it\nmeans when we come to apply it to specific sets of facts. We are\naccustomed to state it confidently in complicated cases where we are\ntoo ignorant of the circumstances to permit of a definite contradiction\nof the assumption (e.g., in the case of the \" flower in the crannied\nwall.\") But there are many simple cases that we know enough about\nto see that complete knowledge of one part does not necessarily involve\ncomplete knowledge of the whole. For instance, complete knowledge\nof what has happened in ten throws of a coin will not tell us what\nwill happen if we go on throwing. Again, the most perfect know\nledge of one side and one angle of a triangle will not suffice to tell us\nthe form of the whole triangle. The whole science of Mathematics\nrests, of course, on the fact that certain things are involved in\ncertain others, so that knowledge of the former is implied in know\nledge of the latter ; but the science shows exactly what and how much\nis required to be known in order to give certain further knowledge.\nThe science of Mathematics owes its certainty to the fact that the\nobjects of which it treats have no real existence. There is thus no\npossibility of the disturbing influences that may come in in the case of\nreal events that succeed one another in Time\u2014events that have to one\nother the relation of what we call cause and effect. The absoluteness\nof Mathematics depends on the assumption of the absence of anv\ndisturbing influences ; it treats merely of what would happen if nothing\ninterfered with whatever forces are taken into consideration. It is\nconceivable that all successions of real events might be predetermined\nfrom the beginning,\u2014as they are assumed to be in Mathematical\nproblems,\u2014with no disturbing influences ever coming in; also that\neach portion might involve and be involved in the rest with the same\ninevitableness that, say, the circumference of a circle involves its radius.\nBut we cannot prove the absence of all disturbing influences ; nor are\nwe justified in assuming that any one portion, if sufficiently known,\nwould give us knowledge of all others.\nIn the first case given in this section, the repeated association of a\ncertain number with trivial incidents, occurring spontaneously, sug\ngested to the person to whom they occurred the action of an external\nIntelligence.\nCase 8.\nThe following case was contributed by Mr. C. C. Massey to Light\nof November 14th and 21st, 1885. It must be observed that Mr.\n\fXXXV.] 200\nCoincidences.\nMassey does not represent the case as valuable evidentially, but merely\nas illustrative of a certain class of experiences.\nNovember 1st.\nI am so little of a psychic that I know nothing of my somnambulic con\nsciousness in general, and though once or twice before I have, while falling\nasleep, detected something like an attempt (quite inarticulate) at a whisper,\nnothing at all similar to the experience of a few nights ago had ever occurred\nto me. . . . Certain numbers haunt me ; they have very distinct associa\ntions for me, but into these I will not enter here. Suffice it to say that one\nof them especially recurs in a certain month of the year, now just past, and\neven on certain days of that month. Latterly, to narrow the problem of\ncoincidence as far as possible, I have refused to take note of mere multiples,\nand have even only given special heed to a certain high number, [99]\nbeing the repetition of the root number [9]. This number is presented\nto me in various objective and seemingly accidental ways, often directly,\nbut more usually by the following mode. My attention will be directed to\nsome slight incident readily to be characterised by one word or two words.\nNow, though the letters of the modern derivative alphabets are not natural\nnumbers, conventionally, so to speak, for this purpose they maybe treated as\nhaving the numerical value of their order ; thus, a = 1, o = 15, z = 26, etc.,\nin the English. It frequently happens, no doubt, that the same incident may\nbe equally well characterised in brief by different words or expressions, and\nthen, of course, the exact summation of the letter values of one of them to\nthe required number is less remarkable, the favourable chances being\nmultiplied by the alternatives. In every case, however, the natural odds\nremain largely adverse. But as, when attention has once been drawn to this\nsort of sympathy (or whatever it should be called) others may seek it in\ntheir own experience, I should add that any seeking or solicitude is perfectly\nidle. To be always on the look-out for such coincidences means spending\nhalf the day in doing silly addition sums. Attention must be awake to them,\nof course, for the incidents will be mostly trivial in themselves. But when\nthe method has been discovered\u2014and how it occurred to me would take long\nto tell\u2014it is only necessary to remember that if there is anything in it at all,\nattention will he arrested sufficiently often to make it almost impossible\nto doubt a significance. The condition seems to be some true and deep\nfeeling concerned. To such, apparently unconscious sympathies respond.\nMere idle curiosity, or scientific interest, will not elicit them. And now,\nhaving premised an explanation which seemed necessary, I will come to the\noccasion of my hearing the \" voice.\"\nIt was at Eastbourne, October 23rd. I had been rather preoccupied\nall day, and late in the evening, having finished some writing, I took up a\nbook and lit a pipe. It then occurred to me that the \"number\" had not\nthat day been given. I felt rather disappointed, when in a few minutes one\nof the little, commonplace incidents with the numerical value occurred in\nthe room where I was sittmg with no other companion than a kitten (who,\nby-the-by, had nothing to do with it). I made the calculation, and soon\nwent on with my book. Later I went to bed, my thoughts occupied with\ncertain abstract speculations unconnected with these experiences. In bed I\nwas still drowsily meditative on the same ideas, when suddenly, to some\n\f210 [part\nAlice Johnson.\ninternal sense of hearing, perfectly articulate, yet with a sort of quick, jerky\nintonation, suggestive of a spasmodic, but successful effort to overcome\nobstruction or difficulty\u2014a breaking in, as it were\u2014sounded two whispered\nwords. Two more common or simple words are not to be found in the\nlanguage (one was only a preposition), nor more utterly foreign to any\nconscious context in my mind. For I was not asleep, though drowsy. They\nroused me instantly, and almost instantly, struck with the absence of any\nintrinsic sense for me in them, I said to myself : \"they will sum out my\nnumber.\" The calculation was quickly made and the result icas exactly as\nanticipated.\n[Mr. Massey informs me that the words were \" To dinner.\"]\nWhatever the explanation, the case certainly has a psychological interest,\nfor it can hardly be ascribed to chance coincidence. Allowing that a sub\nconscious dream faculty\u2014the \" masked \"consciousness\u2014could start an audible\nhallucination of spoken words for the waking consciousness\u2014(the proof that\nI was not asleep is in the fact that a course of waking, though weak,\nthought was distinctly interrupted by the sound, and I could clearly recall\nthat course of thought)\u2014it is not for a moment to be supposed that the\nnumerical coincidence was accidental. It may be suggested that I had sub\nconsciously gone in search of words suitable to my purpose ; I can only say\nthat consciously the process of search would be long and tiresome, as I have\ntested by actual trial. So that the least the case would prove would be\nthe instinctive superiority of the sub-conscious faculty of calculation, coupled\nwith a power to project the result as a hallucination into a waking con\nsciousness not in the least habituated already to such hallucinations.\nI record this case because I can bring it to book for others better than\nthe other modes of my numerical experiences. For myself, those other\nmodes are alone significant, on account of the objective character excluding\ndeceptive agency. In the case in question, even supposing that a spirit\n(perhaps an '\"elemental\") impressed my sense of internal hearing with\nwords of the numerical value, that value would have little more significance\nfor me than if some friend\u2014or some one wishing to play upon a weakness\u2014\npurposely suggested such words to me. The marvel is when strangers,\nletters, chance occurrences, incidents wholly undesigned, and which, in the\nnature of things, must have been determined by endless antecedents,\nco-operate for a result having a particular subjective relation, so that it is\nthe time problem that here presents itself, but with far greater complexity\nthan in the case of prevision. Nor have I anything to urge against those\nwho altogether decline to accept an indefinite statement of such experiences.\nThey are only adverted to here in order to explain the principal incident.\nC. C. M.\nNovember 14th.\nHere is a case in which a numerical coincidence, I think of a very\nextraordinary character, was actually predicted by myself, and that not by\nany occult prevision or impression, but simply by inference from a large\nexperience of similar instances. Those who read my communication in\nlast week's Light will remember the reference there to a certain high number,\nto which the letter values (ascertained by alphabetical order), of words\n\fXXXV.] 211\nCoincidences.\nsuggested to me in a particular relation, sura up. For better appreciation\nof the following case, I will now mention that this high number is 99\u2014the\nrepetition of the root number 9.\nLast night, I took up my new, uncut copy of Notes and Queries, and\nglanced at the contents page\u2014having seen no other. One of the topics\nindexed was \"Smoking in Church.\" This immediately recalled to my mind\nthe incident, heard long ago, of a young pedestrian on the Welsh hills, being\ncaught in a storm, finding shelter in a little church or chapel, and solace in\na cigar there. The recollection belonged to the personal associations for me\nof the aforesaid number, and assuming that the \"Note\" in Notes and\nQueries would be of some specific instance, I said to myself (there was no\none else to say it to), with a confidence amounting to positive assurance,\nthat the name of either smoker or church would sum out the number 99. 1\nthen turned to the place referred to (N. and Q. 6th S. XII. 385), and found\nan account, in a letter of the last century, of how a certain Archbishop\nBlackbourn (so spelt) of York had ordered pipes, tobacco, &c., into the\nvestry of a Nottingham church for his refreshment after a confirmation !\nNow, if any reader will take the trouble to make the calculation, he will find\nthat \" Archbishop \" sums to 99, \" Blackbourn \" sums to 99, and \" of York \"\nsums to 90 ! From experiments I have made with books and. directories, I\nbelieve the odds against any word or name taken at random giving a\nparticular number to be considerably larger than the odds against naming\nthe particular card to be drawn from a pack of 52. Indeed they are\nprobably not much under 100 to 1.\nThe first word of the title of the book cited for the account in Notes and\nQueries is \"Letters,\" also = 99.\nI know well that readers will be inclined to suspect that I have overrated\nor overstated my expectation of this result. No one but myself can know\nhow jealous I am of self-deception, or how used I am to instant analysis of\nmy own feelings and beliefs. But make what abatement you will on this\naccount ; there remains the fact, quite independent of the degree of my\nexpectation, that I was led to seek and to find a very improbable numerical\nresult in particular words of a particular passage out of the whole contents of\nthe paper. c c M\nI have referred to the number of Notes and Queries. The \" Con\ntents \" with the item : \"Smoking in Church \" is on p. 381, so that it\nwould be impossible to see the \" Note,\" which occurs on p. 385, while\nlooking at the \" Contents \" page, and Mr Massey informs me that the\ncopy was uncut.\nIn answer to questions, Mr. Massey has kindly given me the\nfollowing further information :\u2014\n124, Victoria Street, S.W., August 11th, 1898.\nI made brief notes of many of the incidents in question at the time of\ntheir occurrence. But they were of little evidential value, being merely\nmemoranda of dates and words, to enable me to recall the occasions, but\ngiving no detail, usually, of the latter. And they have long been destroyed.\n. . . So I can only repeat generally what I said in Light, that the number\n\f212 [part\nAlice Johnson.\nwas given especially at the (for me) significant season of the year, in quick\nrepetition, by \"strangers, letters, chance occurrences, incideuts wholly\nundesigned.\" Sometimes three or four or even more such occasions would\noccur in the course of a single solitary walk (usually across country from\nEastbourne). To give particulars from memory at this distance of time\nwould be useless, even if I could recall a number of them (some, I certainly\ncan), because you could not \" control \" my statements. At first I took note\nof 9 and its multiples ; but not being able to assign any ratio of probability to\nthe frequent recurrence, I determined to confine my attention to the less\nlikely repetition, 99. The sort of thing went on day after day, more or less,\nfor weeks, and in successive years at the same season, for some four or five\nyears ; now, hardly ever. ... c c Massey\nAugust 19th, 1898.\nThe brief memoranda\u2014words I jotted down immediately after\nthe occurrences\u2014were merely that I might know accurately at the end of\neach day how frequent the coincidences had been. Otherwise they would not\nhelp you now, even had they been kept, as particulars would still depend on\nmy present recollection. But I am sorry that they are not extant, because\nit was just the frequency of the coincidence in a brief period that in my view\nexcluded any merely subjective explanation. Obviously, the latter is not\navailable, if the frequency of objective facts with the numerical signification\nis in excess of any reasonable estimate of what might be ordinarily expected\ndaily for, say, a few successive days. My subliminal self would be\ndependent on external circumstances for the selection, and it was the\nfrequency of circumstances lending themselves to such selection that I say is\nbeyond common probability. We can test this to some extent by experiment,\nand I did so. Often, moreover, only common attention by a mind openly on\nthe alert (as mine was) was requisite, the significant number presenting\nitself without any calculation, e.g., in ticket numbers, numbers of railway\ncarriages (entered before the number was seen), the number given in the\ncourse of a letter from a correspondent wholly unaware of its significance for\nme, and so on. In other cases, no doubt you would have to be satisfied that\nthe key words, so to speak, with the numerical value, were in all cases the\nsimple and obviously descriptive ones, not forced for the purpose. . . .\nC. C. Massey.\nThe explanation of this case that first suggests itself is obviously\nthe one referred to by Mr. Massey\u2014that he \" had subconsciously gone\nin search of words suitable to his purpose.\" The experiences might\nthen be considered akin to the anagrams sometimes occurring in\nautomatic writing,\u2014a striking case of which is given in Mr. Myers'\npaper \" On a Telepathic Explanation of some so-called Spiritualistic\nPhenomena\" in the Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. II., pp. 225-231. The\nparticular interest of these anagrams is, as Mr. Myers says, that \" the\nresult of the involuntary movement of the pen is altogether puzzling to\nthe writer,\u2014is something which he has to make out with difficulty as\nif it were the product of another brain.\" They were \"anagrams,\n\fXXXV.] 213\nCoincidences.\nindeed, of the crudest kind, consisting of mere transpositions of letters,\nbut still puzzles which the writer had to set himself to decipher ab\nextra. The chances against drawing a group of letters at random\nwhich will form several definite words and leave no letters over are, of\ncourse, very great indeed.\" An instance was \" Tefi Hasl Esble Lies \"\n( Life is the less able).\nIn cases like this, we may suppose that the real order of the mental\nprocesses involved is the reverse of the apparent order. In inventing\na riddle in the ordinary way, we first invent the answer and then\nconcoct a suitable question ; but in propounding it to another person,\nwe put the question first. In dreams it sometimes occurs that we our\nselves have a riddle propounded to us ; we then seem to hear the\nquestion first, with no consciousness of knowing the answer, which\ncomes to us later as a surprise, although we must really have known\nit beforehand. Such a dream is \" dramatised backwards,\" like the\nexample given below (see p. 263). The apparent mystery in these\nanagrams is of the same kind ; it consists in the writer seeming to put\nthe question to himself and subsequently finding out the answer, which\nhe must have known subconsciously all the time.\nSimilarly, in Mr. Massey's case, his subliminal self may have\nstarted with the number 99 and made up words, e.g., \"To dinner,\"\nwhose letters summed up to it, presenting the finished result of its\nlabours to his supraliminal self. To the latter, this might appear\nlike a riddle propounded by some external source, the answer to which\nit worked out and found to be 99. The explanation depends on the\nassumption that mental processes can be apparently reversed as\ndescribed, but it seems to me that the large number of cases that can\nbe thus explained justify the assumption.\nIt is not even necessary to assume the apparent reversal in all the\ninstances referred to by Mr. Massey. In cases where an incident\noccurred that could be described briefly in several different terms or\nexpressions, the subliminal self might be supposed to select the term\nsuited for its purpose and to reject altogether cases in which\nit could find no suitable words. This would merely imply that\nthe finished result alone would be presented to the supraliminal self,\nthe mental processes leading up to it being performed unconsciously.\nThe cases where the number was presented directly, as on tickets or\nrailway carriages, might be merely instances of selective attention to\nit. (The incident of \" smoking in church \" cannot be thus explained,\nbut a single case like this cannot, of course, be regarded as evidence\nof anything beyond chance.)\nAll this implies no further assumption than that Mr. Massey's sub\nliminal self acquired a special readiness in playing a sort of game,\u2014\nrather more difficult than the making of anagrams, but a person who has\n\f214 [part\nAlice Johnson.\nspent a little time over puzzles of this kind soon acquires what seems\nto one totally inexperienced in them great quickness and skill. \"With\nregard to the number 99, it will be seen at once that at least 7 or 8\nletters would generally be required to form it, since\u2014if all the letters\nof the alphabet occurred equally often\u201413 would be the average value\nof any letter taken at random. But more than 8 letters would generally\nbe wanted, since the letters in the first half of the alphabet occur much\noftener than those in the second half. That this is so with initials can be\nseen in any dictionary, e.g., I see that the first 13 letters\u2014A to M \u2014take\nup about TV of the space in an old edition of Johnson's Dictionary.\nThis shows roughly the actual proportion of words beginning with\nthese letters. The greater frequency with which such words occur may\nbe shown roughly by the fact that the same initial letters take up 16 out\nof the 24 volumes of the Encyclopedia Britannica. (It is instructive\nto observe that the letter M\u2014which Napoleon is said to have regarded\nas having a special significance in his life\u2014takes up a little more than\ntwo out of these sixteen volumes). Words clearly too long or too short\nfor the number would be at once rejected, and it is not very difficult to\nimagine that the subliminal self could memorise all the letters of the\nalphabet so as to substitute at once for the letter its numerical -equiva\nlent, and add up the numbers rapidly whenever it saw that they would\ncome to something like 99. The interest that Mr. Massey had come to\nattach to the number might furnish a fully sufficient motive for the\nexercise, which otherwise would have seemed trivial and childish.\nIn the next case the apparently significant numbers were presented\nin a simple and direct fashion.\nCase 9.\nThe account is translated and slightly abridged from the Annate*\ndes Sciences Psychiques for March-April, 1899.\nThe narrator, M. E. Desbeaux, writes to Dr. Dariex that these cases\nare extracted from his private diary, under their respective dates ; that he\nhas been to Monte Carlo twenty-three times, and has never had any other\npremonitions.\nHis account is as follows :\u2014\nCase 1. \u2014On Wednesday, February 6th, 1889, at Monte Carlo, taking a\nwalk in the afternoon, I found a rusty horse-shoe. Being superstitious, like\nall gamblers, I picked it up, since\u2014as every one knows\u2014a horse-shoe,\nespecially a rusty one, brings luck ! On standing up again my eye fell on the\nnumber 6, painted red on a mile-stone. I said to myself, \"That is the\nnumber to bet on to-day,\" but I had hardly finished making this reflection\nwhen I found myself gazing at the number 28 imprinted on the lamp of a\ncarriage that had stopped in front of me. I thought at once that, if I saw the\n6 turn up on one of the roulette tables, I ought next to stake on the 28.\n\fXXXv.] 215\nCoincidences.\nTwo hours after this little incident, which I had almost forgotten, I went\ninto the gambling saloon. I went up to a table, and almost at once saw the\n6 turn up. Then, but only then, I remembered that I ought to stake on\nthe 28. As I had been losing for several days, and had but a very limited\nconfidence in my prognostic, I hesitated, and instead of staking a louis on\nthe 28 alone, I merely staked 5 francs on the six numbers (transversale)\n28\u201433. The croupier threw the ball, and the 28 turned up.\nCase 2.\u2014On Tuesday, December 26th, 1894 ... just as I was\ncoming out of [a house] 1 was obliged to start back out of the way of a\ncarriage, with lighted lamps, driving hurriedly by. The number of this\ncarriage\u201422\u2014was flashed on my eyes. Then it occurred to me that this was\nthe first number I had seen since [an incident which he had amused himself\nby regarding as a lucky portent], I entered the Casino, but there was no\nprior indication which could serve as my cue (point de depart) as in the\nprevious case ; it was therefore with no confidence that I placed five or six\ncoins on the 22. This number did not turn up, and I retired. I had\ndinner and then came back, convinced of the necessity of having a cue, and\nDestiny not having indicated one to me, I decided in my own mind that this\nshould be the number 1. I then walked about among the tables, waiting for\nthe moment when I should see No. 1 turn up. At the end of an hour,\nhaving seen nothing, I went towards the door to smoke a cigarette in the\nanteroom, when passing by a table I heard the croupier call out, \" 1, red,\nodd number, manque.1 \" Here was my cue. I put down a Join,s on the 22.\nThe croupier threw his ball again, and 22 turned up.\nThe next day we lunched with our friends, the B.'s, at the Hotel du\nCap Martin. The first thing I noticed on the table at which we were sitting\nwas a white card, supported on a copper stand, bearing the number 222\n(a number referring to the service of the hotel and restaurant). My\nsuperstitious mind was struck with the oddity of finding again under my\neyes the 22 which had favoured me the evening before. I wondered if this\nwas not another gracious guidance from Fate, and I thought that the first\n2 probably meant that 22 would turn up twice for me that day. These\nreflections were, of course, made rapidly and internally, without conviction.\nAt nine o'clock in the evening I went into the rooms, and had hardly\napproached one of the tables when 1 saw the number 1 turn up. Then,\nthinking of nothing but the system which had succeeded the evening before,\nI put a louis on the 22. Then the 22 turned up. \" Here is one,\" I thought,\n\"and if my prognostic is correct, there should be a second.\" Having picked\nup my winnings, I left on the 22, as my custom was, the louis which had\njust won. The croupier threw the ball, and called out : \" 2, black, even\nnumber, manque.\" This time my louis returned to the bank, and I was going\nto look for another table where 1 might see the 1 appear, when I suddenly\nremembered for the first time the card numbered 222 at the Cap Martin,\nand I thought at the same time that 1 had the initial indication which had\nfailed me the evening before ; it was this 2, preceding a 22, which should be\nmy cue. I hastened to throw a louis on the 22. The ball twisted and\nturned and fell into the 22. This happened under the eyes of two of my\n1 Manque indicates any of the numbers from 1 to 18 inclusive, being contrasted\nwith paste, which indicates any of those from 19 to 36 inclusive.\u2014A.J.\n\f21G [part\nAlice Johnson.\nfriends, 1 who, not being aware of the course of my thoughts, were\nastonished to see me hit off the precise number twice in three turns\u2014both\nthe winning numbers being 22.\nCase 3. \u2014On Friday, February 3rd, 1899, at Monte Carlo, I waa walking\nabout before lunch, thinking sadly that ever since my arrival in this beautiful\ncountry, namely, for three days, the roulette had been treating me unkindly.\nSuddenly at a street corner my glance fell on the number 11 painted on a\nwall. \"Can this.be. an indication of Destiny?\" I thought, half sceptically,\nhalf credulously. But at once I remembered my two previous cases, and I\nrecognised the necessity of having another indication to act as my cue, as\nbefore. \"Well,\" I said, \" the first figure that I see shall be this.\" At once\nI saw coming towards me an electric tram with the figure 4 on its front,\nlarge and standing out clearly. I took note of it.\nAt about four o'clock I entered the Casino. I walked about among the\ntables, hoping to see my 4 turn up. At the end of an hour I had seen\nnothing of it. Becoming bored, I began to play, thinking no more of my\nprognostic. I played for an hour with 5 franc pieces only, and did not win\nonce. At last, at six o'clock, I went up to a table in the large room, and saw\nthe 4 turn up. There was my cue. I at once put a louts on the 11, and the\nII came next.\nSatisfied. I went towards the door, but, crossing the last room, I glanced\nat the table on the left, where there were comparatively few people. At\nthat moment the 4 turned up before me. At once I put a lonis on the 11,\nand\u2014actually\u2014the 11 came next ! . . .\nM. Desbeaux discusses with some ingenuity the metaphysical diffi\nculties of any theory of premonition as applied to these cases; but,\ncuriously enough, among the various hypotheses he suggests to explain\nthem, that of chance coincidence is not mentioned ! With a view to\ntesting this, it is unfortunate that his diary\u2014like so many other\ndiaries\u2014recorded the number of hits only, and not the number of\nmisses. Still it is made clear that the latter were very numerous, and\nthe narrative, as a whole, is hardly calculated to increase one's\nconfidence in portents.\nThere is another kind of numerical coincidences in the collection\nof which much time and ingenuity has been expended by various\npersons : I mean, coincidences relating to dates. I give an instance\nwhich I have seen quoted more than once as an especially noteworthy\none, though, so far as I know, no estimate has ever been made of the\ndegree of its improbability.\nCase 10.\nLouis Philippe became King of France in 1830, and abdicated\nin 1848. There are three important dates connected with his life\u2014\n1 M. H. M., who has recently reminded me of the incident, would, if necessary,\nbear witness of it. and Mm\u00ab S., his sister. [The names of these persons were given in\nconfidence to Dr. Danes.]\n\fXXXV.] 217\nCoincidences.\nthe date of his birth, of his wife's birth, and of their marriage \u2014 the\nfour digits of each of which, added to the date of his accession,\nmakes the date of his abdication ; in other words, the four digits\nadded together are in each case equal to the number of years that he\nreigned, namely, 18. Thus :\u2014\nDate of accession ...\nDate of\nbirth\n1830\nn\n7\n7\n3\n1848\nDate of\nwife's\nbirth\n1830\nn\n7\n8\n2\n1848\nDate of\nmarriage\n1830\nfl\n8\n0\n9\n1848\nA somewhat similar,\u2014but, as will be seen, far less remarkable,\u2014,\nseries of coincidences is to be found in the life history of Napoleon III.,\nwho became Emperor of France in 1852 and abdicated in 1870. The\nfour digits of the corresponding three dates in his life, added to the\ndate of his accession, come in each case to a year short of the date of\nabdication ; that is, they each add up to 17, which is one less than\nthe number of years that he reigned. Thus :\u2014\nDate of accession 1852\nfl\nDate of\nbirth\nDate of\nwife's\nbirth\n1852\nfl\n1869 1809\n1852\nn\nDate of\nmarriage\n1869\nIn the case of Louis Philippe, the coincidences consist in the digits\nof all the three dates summing up to a given number, 18. This number\nmay be said to be \" given,\" because it is obtained independently of the\nsum of the digits, namely, from the length of the reign. Thus, three\nnumbers, taken more or less at random, are all equal to a given\nnumber.\nIn the case of Napoleon III., the three numbers are all equal to\none another, but are not equal to a given number ; the length of reign\nis 18 years and the digits sum up to 17. The antecedent improbability\nof their summing up to 17 is exactly the same as that of their summing\nup to 18 (this would not be the case with all possible sums of four\ndigits, but may be found to be so in the case of the sums 17 and 18,\nwhen the first digit is 1, as in all the dates now being considered).\nBut 17 only happens to be the number that they sum up to; it is\nnot a number obtained independently of them, as the 18 is obtained in\nLouis Philippe's dates.\nQ 2\n\f218 [part\nAlice Johnson.\nTaking Louis Philippe's dates we may first consider what is the\nprobability that the digits of the date of his birth should sum up to\n18. As he came to the throne in 1830 he must have been born either\nin the 18th or 19th century, therefore the first digit must be 1 and the\nsecond 7 or 8. It will be found that a date whose digits sum up to 18\noccurs once in every ten years between the dates 1719 and 1890,\nwhich are respectively the earliest and the latest dates in the two\ncenturies fulfilling the condition required, and as it is obvious from the\ncircumstances of the case that the birth must have taken place\nbetween these limits, the probability that the digits would sum up to\n18 was T'^. The date of his wife's birth and of their marriage must\nalso have come within these limits, so that the probability in each case\nthat the digits would sum up to 18 is and the probability that they\nwould do so in all three cases is l0100.\nTaking Napoleon III.'s dates, we have to ask what is the proba\nbility that the digits of the three dates should all add up to the same\nnumber ; or, in other words, what is the probability that the sum of\nthe digits of two of the dates should both be equal to the sum of the\ndigits of the third\u2014this sum being 17. A date whose digits sum up\nto 17 occurs once in every ten years between 1709 and 1880, and as,\nfrom the circumstances of the case, both dates must be within these\nlimits, the probability is in each case y^, and the probability of its\noccurring in both cases is T^-,j.\nA little consideration will show that the particular dates involved\nare specially favourable ones for the occurrence of these coincidences.\nIn each series, all the dates must, from the nature of the case, fall\nwithin 100 years of one another. Practically then, it is a question of\nall the possible sums of the last two digits. There are nineteen\npossible sums (from 0 to 18 inclusive) of two digits, and a hundred\ndifferent ways of obtaining them ; but while 0 and 18 can each be\nobtained in only one way, so that the probability of the occurrence of\neach of them is the sums that can be obtained most frequently\nare 9 (in ten different ways), and 8 and 10 (each in nine different\nways). Now it is either 8, 9, or 10\u2014the chance of whose occurrence\nis most favourable \u2014that is required as the sum of the two last digits\nin all the dates (since the first two digits are always 1 and 7 or 8) to\nmake the four digits add up to 17 or 18.\nIf any argument is needed to show the utter irrationality of\nattaching any significance to coincidences such as these, one might be\nfurnished by observing that there are cases in which they could not\npossibly occur. Thus, if a man were born in the first year of any\ncentury, say, in 1800, the digits of the date of his birth could not\nsum up to the same as the digits of any other date in his life, but\nmust always fall below them; or if he were born, say, in 1799, a\n\fXXxv.] Coincidences. 210\ncoincidence would be almost impossible, as it could not occur before\n1 889, and so on.\nFurther examples of a similar kind, to which similar reasoning is\napplicable, are to be found in the following passage, which is taken\nfrom a discussion of \"fortuitous coincidences\" in Jevons' Principles\nof Science. (Third Edition, p. 263.)\nCase 11.\nIn historical and social matters, coincidences are frequently pointed out\nwhich are due to chance, although there is always a strong popular tendency\nto regard them as the work of design, or as having some hidden meaning.\nIf to 1794, the number of the year in which Robespierre fell, we add the\nsum of its digits, the result is 1815, the year in which Napoleon fell ; the\nrepetition of the process gives 1830, the year in which Charles the Tenth\nabdicated. Again, the French Chamber of Deputies in 1830 consisted of\n402 members, of whom 221 formed the party called '\u2022 La queue de Robes\npierre,\" while the remainder, 181 in number, were named \" Les honnetes\ngens.\" If we give to each letter a numerical value corresponding to its\nplace in the alphabet, it will be found that the sum of the values of the\nletters in each name exactly indicates the number of the party.\nThe remaining cases I give in this section relate to \"lucky \" events\nof greater or less importance to the persons concerned.\nCask 12.\nThe first is a case of scientific discovery being hastened by a\nfortunate coincidence,\u2014that of an Egyptian papyrus and a Greek\ntranslation of the same papyrus coming into the hands of the investi\ngator, Dr. Thomas Young, through two independent sources, almost\nat the same time. The narrative is taken from Dr. Young's\nAccount of some recent discoveries in Hicroglyphical Literature and\nEgyptian Antiquities (London, 1823). He was engaged in 1814\nin comparing and deciphering the two forms of Egyptian inscriptions\non the \" Pillar of Rosetta \" (commonly known as the Rosetta Stone).\nHe had made tome progress with the work, and\u2014\nIn 1821 he discovered \"at Leghorn among a multitude of Egyptian\nantiquities belonging to Mr. Drovetti, the French Consul at Alexandria, a\nstone containing an enchorial1 and a Greek inscription, which was known to\nhave existed formerly at Menouf, but which had been lost and almost forgotten\nby European travellers in Egypt and I believe by Mr. Drovetti himself.\"\nDrovetti refused his request to be allowed to take a copy of this. Soon after\noccurred (op. cit., p. 38) \" the arrival of Mr. Casati at Paris, with a parcel of\ni Young used the term \" enchorial \" because this form of writing is called in the\nGreek Enchoria Grummata. Champollion preferred the word \" demotic,\" or writing\nof the people, and the latter term is used in the description of the Rosetta Stone in\nthe British Museum.\n\f220 [part\nAlice Johnson.\nmanuscripts, among which Mr. Champollion discovered one that considerably\nresembled, in its preamble, the enchorial text of the Pillar of Rosetta ; \"\n(p. 43) ' ' Mr. Champollion had ascertained the analogy of one of the\nmanuscripts, purchased of Casati, to the enchorial inscription of Rosetta,\nand he had obtained from it without difficulty, the mode of writing the name\nCleopatra in that character. He did not, however, then mention to me the\nimportant consequences which he had derived from this discovery.\" . . .\nLater came (p. 55) ' ' an event which is the most important, considered as a\nsingle occurrence, that has taken place since the commencement of my Egyp\ntian researches. It was very soon after my return from France that George\nFrancis Grey, Esq., of University College, Oxford, having been at Naples\nupon his return from Egypt, . . . had the kindness, on the 22nd of\nNovember last, to leave with me a box containing several fine specimens of\nwriting and drawing on papyrus ; they were chiefly in hieroglyphics, and of\na mythological nature ; but the two which he had before described to me as\nparticularly deserving attention, and which were brought, through his\njudicious precautions, in excellent preservation, both contained some Greek\ncharacters, written apparently in a pretty legible hand. He had purchased\nthem of an Arab at Thebes, in January, 1820 ; and that which was most\nintelligible had appeared, at first sight, to contain some words relating to the\nservice of the Christian church. . , .\n\"Mr. Champollion had done me the favour, while I was at Paris, to copy\nfor me some parts of the very important papyrus, which I have before\nmentioned as having given him the name of Cleopatra ; and of which the\ndiscovery was certainly a great event in Egyptian literature, since it was the\nfirst time that any intelligible characters, of the enchorial form, had been\ndiscovered among the many manuscripts and inscriptions that had been\nexamined, and since it furnished Mr. Champollion at the same time with a\nname which materially advanced, if I understood him rightly, the steps\nthat have led him to his very important extension of the hieroglyphical\nalphabet. He had mentioned to me in conversation the names of Apollonian,\n'AiUiochut,' and Antigomu as occurring among the witnesses ; and I easily\nrecognised the groups which he had deciphered ; although, instead of\nAntiochus, I read Antimacltus, and I did not recollect at the time that he\nhad omitted the m.\n\"In the evening of the day that Mr. Grey had brought me his manuscripts\nI proceeded impatiently to examine that which was in Greek only ; and I\ncould scarcely believe that 1 was awake and in my sober senses, when I\nobserved, among the names of the witnesses, Antimachus Antigenis ; and a\nfew lines further back, Purtis Apollonii, although the last word could not\nhave been very easily deciphered, without the assistance of the conjecture,\nwhich immediately occurred to me, that this manuscript might perhaps be a\ntranslation of the enchorial manuscript of Casati. I found that its beginning\nwas ' A copy of an Egyptian writing . . . ; ' and I proceeded to\nascertain that there were the same number of names intervening between the\nGreek and the Egyptian signatures that I had identified and that the same\nnumber followed the last of them ; and the whole number of witnesses\nappeared to be sixteen in each. The last paragraph in the Greek began with\nthe words, ' Copy of the Registry ; ' for such must be the signification of\n\fXXXV.] 221\nCoincidences.\nthe word n T Q M A T O 2, employed in this papyrus, though it does not\nappear to occur anywhere else in a similar signification. I could not, there\nfore, but conclude that a most extraordinary chance had brought into my\npossession a document which was not very likely, in the first place, ever to\nhave existed, still less to have been preserved uninjured, for my information,\nthrough a period of near two thousand years ; but that this very extra\nordinary translation should have been brought safely to Europe, to England\nand to me, at the very moment when it was most of all desirable to me to\npossess it, as the illustration of an original which I was then studying, but\nwithout any other reasonable hope of being able fully to comprehend it ;\nthis combination would, in other times, have been considered as affording\nample evidence of my having become an Egyptian sorcerer.\n\" Mr. Ohampollion had not thought it worth while to give me a transcript\nof the original Greek endorsement ; he seemed to consider it as not fully\nagreeing with the Egyptian text, or at any rate not materially assisting in\nits interpretation : . . . [and] after an accidental delay of a month, the\nanswer that I received from Paris was only such as to enable me to state\nthat my opinion of the identity of the two endorsements is fully confirmed.\nI have lost, however, no time in sending to the Conservators of the King's\ncabinet a copy of my registry ; with a request to be favoured with theirs in\nreturn .... in order that the duplicates may stand side by side in\nthe lithographical copy. . . . My application for the copy of the\nRegistry has been received with the liberality which was to be expected\nfrom the directors of a great institution, and I have to return my best\nthanks to Mr. Raoul Rochette for a correct copy of the whole of this highly\nimportant manuscript.\n\"The contents of Mr. Grey's Greek manuscript are of a nature scarcely\nless remarkable than its preservation and discovery : it relates to the sale,\nnot of a house, or a field, but of a portion of the Collections and Offerings\nmade from time to time on account, or for the benefit, of a certain number\nof Mummies, of persons described at length, in very bad Greek, with their\nchildren and all their households. The price is not very clearly expressed ;\nbut as the portion sold is only a moiety of a third part of the whole, and as\nthe testimony of sixteen witnesses was thought necessary on the occasion,\nit is probable that the revenue, thus obtained by the priests, was by no\nmeans inconsiderable.\n\" The result derived at once from this comparison is the identification of\nmore than thirty proper names as they were written in the running haud of\nthe country. . . .\n\"A second papyrus, [obtained by Mr. Grey] of considerably greater\nmagnitude, contains three Egyptian conveyances in the enchorial character,\nwith separate registries on the margin in very legible Greek. These\n.... afford us also many additional examples of enchorial proper names,\nbesides a general idea of the subjects of the respective manuscripts, all of\nwhich relate to the sale of lands in the neighbourhood of Thebes.\"\nOn pp. 69-75 of the book Dr. Young gives translations of \" the enchorial\npapyrus of Paris containing the original deed relating to the mummies \" and\nMr. Grey's \"Greek Antigraph,\" which begins,\u2014 \"Copy of an Egyptian\nwriting respecting the dead bodies in Thyn. . . .\" On comparing these\n\f222 [part\nAlice Johnson.\ntwo translations, it appears that the Greek is a slightly abridged copy of the\nEgyptian document, the preamble (\"in the reign of So-and-So\"\u2014giving a\nlist of kings, priests, and gods) being omitted ; after the name of each of\nthe dead persons, the phrase \" with his children and his household \" found\nin the Egyptian is mostly omitted in the Greek, as well as a short passage\nwhich seems to give a sort of summary of the persons after enumerating\nthem. The Egyptian document, before the names of the witnesses, ends\nthus:\u2014\"Executed and confirmed: written by Horus the son of Phabis,\nclerk to the chief priests of Amonrasonther and the contemplar? Gods, of the\nBeneficent Gods, of the Father-loving Gods, of the Paternal God and of the\nMother-loving Gods, Amen \" ; while the Greek says merely\u2014\" Written by\nHorus, the son of Phabis, the writer of the [priests] of Amonrasonther and\nthe other gods of the Temple.\" The main parts of the documents, however,\njudging from the translations, undoubtedly correspond so closely that there\ncan be no question that the Greek is a translation of the Egyptian.\nThe date of the documents was supposed by Dr. Young to be from\n146\u2014135 b.C.\nThe probability of occurrence of this coincidence may, I think, be\ntaken as equivalent to the probability that an MS. taken at random\nout of all the MSS. so far discovered in Egypt should turn out to be a\nGreek translation of a given demotic MS.\nGreek being the official language in Egypt at the date when the\nMS. was written, legal documents would often have been written in it;\nand if one of the contracting parties did not understand the language\nof the other, which might often be the case, the document would\nprobably be duplicated in the two languages. Of course only a small\nproportion of these legal documents would be preserved up to the\npresent century. But it is practically certain that, when they were\nduplicated, the duplicates would have been originally kept together in\nthe same archives (see Mr. Griffith's letter, below), so that, when first\nunearthed, they would be unearthed together, and if one was pre\nserved, probably both would be. Therefore Dr. Young's duplicates\nwere almost certainly included originally in the same find and\nseparated later.\nNow, if the duplicates had been kept separate to begin with, so\nthat one of them might have been preserved and the other not, the\nchance that one document found in Egypt should turn out to be the\nduplicate or translation of a certain other one would depend on the\ntotal number of documents of all kinds that had ever existed in Egypt,\nand would thus be very small. But since, as just remarked, it is pretty\ncertain that both duplicates or neither would be preserved and found,\nthe chance depends practically on the total number of documents of all\nkinds that had been found in Egypt at that date (about 1820), and is\nthus comparatively large. By the word \" found,\" I mean merely\nunearthed and preserved. I do not mean to imply necessarily that\n\fXXXV.] 223\nCoincidences.\nany discovery had been made of the nature of the documents, or even\nof the language in which they were written, but only that \u2014whether in\nthe hands of investigators or dealers\u2014they formed part of the total\nmaterial then accessible for study. Probably no one knew at that\ntime that any of the Greek MSS. were translations.\nThe chance in question may, then, be expressed as follows :\u2014\nLet e be the number of documents in the Egyptian language that\nhad been found, of which t had been translated into Greek and ex\nhypollieai found, and g the number of Greek documents \u2014 not transla\ntions\u2014which had been found. Then the chance that there had ever\nbeen a translation of a given Egyptian document is \u2014 and the chance\ne\nthat a particular document taken at random out of all the documents\nfound should be the translation in question is - that is, it\ne (e+g + t),\nincreases with the extent to which translations were made, and\ndecreases with the extent to which documents of all kinds had been\nfound. It cannot possibly be greater than i this being the\ne+g+t,\nvalue on the extreme supposition that all Egyptian documents had\nbeen translated, in which case t = e, and the chance then depends\nmerely on the total number of documents found. Actually, no doubt,\nI is considerably less than e and the chance is decreased accordingly.\nIn considering this problem, it may appear at first sight that the\nGreek MS. was not taken at random at all, as Grey had specially\ndrawn Young's attention to it. But there was no idea on the part of\neither of them that it might turn out to be a translation ; from the\npoint of view of its being such, it was quite at random that Young\nexamined it first out of all those that Grey had sent him.\nFrom the same point of view, it was, as it seems to me, quite at\nrandom that the MS. to which attention was drawn was a Greek MS.\nAnd for this reason I have treated it simply as an MS. taken at\nrandom. But if it be considered that this view is not legitimate, we\nshould then have to regard it as a Greek MS. taken at random, which\nof course increases the probability of its turning out a translation.\nUsing the same notation as before, the chance may be expressed as\nfollows :\u2014\nThe chance that there had ever been a translation of a given\nEgyptian document is, as before, \u2014 The chance that a particular\ne.\ndocument taken at random out of g + t Greek documents should be\nthe translation is - If g = 0, that is, if there are no Greek\ne{g + l).\n\f224 [part\nAlice Johnson.\ndocuments except translations, (which, of course, is infinitely far from\nfact) the chance is simply that is, depends only on the number of\nEgyptian documents and is independent of the number of translations\nthat were made. Otherwise, it depends on I and increases as t\nincreases. On the extreme supposition that t = e, that is, that every\nEgyptian document was translated (likewise utterly contrary to factJ,\nthe chance is simply - \u2014 that is, depends merely on the number\nof Greek documents. These two formulse, \u2014 and \u2014-\u2014. give the\ne g + t,\ngreatest possible values of the fraction, \u2014 being the case in which the\ne\ndenominator is as small as possible and \u2014 that in which the\nv g + t\nnumerator is as large as possible.\nIt is important to note, further, that the chance of the duplicates\ncoming together again, after having been once separated, depended\nlargely on the number of places in which any exploration had been\nmade. Obviously, the fewer places had been explored, the greater is\nthe chance of the reunion of the duplicates. It seems possible (see\nbelow) that only two places had been explored then, so that the\nchance was much increased by this.\nIn whatever form the problem be stated, there are, unfortunately,\ntoo many unknown quantities in it to admit of an exact solution.\nHowever, through the courtesy of Professor Ernest Gardner, I was put\ninto communication with Mr. F. L. Griffith (Editor of the Archaso-\nlogical Survey of the Egypt Exploration Fund), who is well-known as\nthe leading authority on Egyptian manuscripts, and who has very\nkindly given me what information is available towards the solution.\nHe writes :\u2014\nRiversvale, Ashton-under-Lyne, August 21st, 1898.\nThe coincidence you treat of, wonderful as it seems, is by no means so\nextraordinary as it appears at first sight. It is quite true that the copy or\n\"antigraph \" in Greek would be kept with the original demotic. The latter\nwas the real instrument, the former was only intended to make it intelligible\nto the Greek officials, etc., and naturally they would be kept together. The\nGreek antigraphs, of which several are known, are more or less abbreviated ;\nthe example in question is singularly full. Of course theso bilingual* only\nexist for a short period under the Ptolemies and Roman emperors and form\nonly a minute portion of the MS. documents from Egypt.\nIt was very usual to endorse, demotic documents in Greek giving a brief\nindication of the contents ; the Greek documents themselves were likewise\nendorsed in Greek.\nI am afraid I could give no estimate of the number of Greek translations,\nGreek originals, or of the total number of MSS. from Egypt discovered and\n\fXXXV.] 225\nCoincidences.\npreserved down to 1820, unless indeed after long research, which I must not\nundertake now. The trade in antiquities and papyri was then very active,\nand while very few lists existed of the collections, numbers of objects were\nbeing hawked about or brought home by travellers. . . .\nF. LI. Griffith.\nP.S.\u2014Unfortunately, \"unearthing\" documents did not always lead to\ntheir preservation. Except in the few places where their value was\nunderstood, they were burnt or thrown away.\nThere was no systematic exploration in Egypt before 1820, but Thebes\nwas the hunting ground and next to it Memphis. I doubt whether\ndocuments were preserved from any other sites at that time.\nCase 13.\nWith the foregoing we may compare another instance of quite a\ndifferent kind taken from the history of Astronomy, where two\nindependent discoveries, completed almost at the same time, led to\nresults correlated to one another in an important way.\nThe account is taken from an article on \" Coincidences and\nSuperstitions \" in the Cornhill Magazine, Vol. XXVI. (July to\nDecember, 1872), pp. 684 et seq. The article in the Cornhill\nMagazine is unsigned, but is reprinted under the same title in\nKnowledge, Vol. V. (1884), the authorship being there disclosed as\nthat of R. A. Proctor. He writes :\u2014\nThe history of Astronomy has in quite recent times afforded a very\nremarkable instance of repeated coincidences. We refer to the researches\nby which the theory has been established that meteors and comets are so far\nassociated that meteor systems travel in the track of comets. It will readily\nbe seen from the following statements .... that the demonstration\nof this theory must be regarded as partly due to singular good fortune :\u2014\nThere are two very remarkable meteor systems\u2014the system which\nproduces the November shooting-stars, or Lermides, and that which produces\nthe August shooting-stars, or Perxides. It chanced that the year 1866\nwas the time when a great display of November meteors was expected by\nastronomers. Hence, in the years 1865 and 1866, considerable attention\nwas directed to the whole subject of shooting-stars. Moreover, so many\nastronomers watched the display of 1866, that very exact information was for\nthe first time obtained as to the apparent track of these meteors. It is\nnecessary to mention that such information was essential to success in the\nmain inquiry. Now it had chanced that in 1862 a fine comet had been seen,\nwhose path approached the earth's path very closely indeed. This led the\nItalian astronomer Schiaparelli to inquire whether there might not be some\nconnection between this comet and the August shooting-stars, which cross\nthe earth's path at the same place. He was able, by comparing the path of\nthe comet and the apparent paths of the meteors, to render this opinion\nhighly probable. Then came inquiries into the real paths of the November\nmeteors, these inquiries being rendered just practicable by several coinci\ndences, as\u2014(1) the exact observations just mentioned ; (2) the existence of\n\f22G [part\nAlice Johnson.\ncertain old accounts of the meteor shower ; (3) the wonderful mastery\nobtained by Professor Adams over all problems of perturbation (for the\nquestion depended on the way in which the November meteors had been\nperturbed) ; and (4) the existence of a half-forgotten treatise by Gauss,\nsupplying formula which reduced Adams' labours by one-half. The path\nhaving been determined by Adams .... the whole question rested on\nthe recognition of a comet travelling in the same path. If such a comet were\nfound, Schiaparelli's case was made out. If not, then, though the evidence\nmight be convincing to mathematicians well grounded in the theory of\nprobabilities, yet it was all but certain that Schiaparelli's theory would\npresently sink into oblivion. Now there are probably hundreds of comets\nwhich have a period of 33^ years, but very few are known\u2014 only three\ncertainly\u2014and one of these had only just been discovered when Adams' results\nwere announced. The odds were enormous against the required comet being\nknown, and yet greater against its having been so well watched that its true\npath had been ascertained. Yet the comet which had been discovered in\nthat very year 1866\u2014the comet called Tempel's, or I. 1866\u2014was the very\ncomet required to establish Schiaparelli's theory. There was the path of the\nmeteors assigned by Adams, and the path of the comet had been already\ncalculated by Tempel before Adams' result had been announced ; and these\ntwo paths were found to be to all intents and purposes (with an accuracy far\n.exceeding indeed the requirements of the case) identical.\nCase 14.\nThe next case, referring to a curiously lucky little incident, was\ncontributed to Notes and Queries in 1895 (8th Series, Vol. VIII., p.\n270), by Mr. C. J. Feret, F.R.G.S., F.R. Hist. Soc., author of an\nexhaustive history of the parish of Fulham, which is about to be\npublished under the title of Fulham Old and New.\nMr. Feret writes :\u2014\n49, Edith Road, West Kensington, W.\n. . . Christmas, 1892, I spent at Southsea. One day I wanted to get\nsome envelopes of a somewhat unusual size. I tried some dozen stationers'\nshops in the town, but not one could supply me. I gave up my quest in\ndespair and was returning home to dinner. T had nearly reached the top of\nPalmerston Road when I saw a small parcel lying on the pavement. I\npicked it up, and, as it bore no printed address of a shop, I took it back\nwith me to my apartments. You may judge my astonishment when, on\nopening it, I found it to contain a packet of twenty-five envelopes of the\nprecise size for which I had fruitlessly enquired ! My sister, who was with\nme at the time, can vouch for the truth of this incident.\nChas. Jas. Feret.\nI wrote to Mr. Feret asking for his sister's recollections of the\nincident, which she has kindly sent me.\nShe writes :\u2014\n49, Edith Road, West Kensington, April 19tfc, 1898.\nMy dear Madam,\u2014I have referred to the paragraph in Notes and\nQueries which my brother wrote. It is perfectly accurate in every detail.\n\fXXXV.] 227\nCoincidences.\nMy brother and I, after having failed to get the envelopes we wanted\n(rather an extra size), were returning home to dine. Just as we were cross\ning the Palmerston Road to go down Marmion Road I noticed a small\nparcel on the pavement. I picked it up, but as there was no name on the\npacket and no one seemed to be looking out for anything lost we took it\nhome and there opened it. As we could hear of no owner, and the packet\nafforded no clue, we used them, as they were precisely what we wanted.\nWe have often talked about it. A stranger coincidence, except in the\nrealm of fiction, it would be impossible to conceive. I hope these facts may\nbe of use to you.-Yours faithfully, c TkR^\nThe next case relates to the finding of a lost object, much valued\nby its owners.\nCase 15.\nThe account appeared in T\/te Spectator of August 27th, 1898,\namong \" Letters to the Editor,\" under the title of \" The Romance of\na Ring.\"\nWaldron Rectory, Sussex, August 22W.\nMany years ago, when at Oxford, my father gave me as a\nheirloom a ring presented to him by au old friend, and bearing an inscription\nstating that it contained the hair of the Duke of Wellington. This ring I\ngave to my wife on our marriage in 1876. In October, 1879, when we were on\na visit to Mr. W. Arkwright, of Sutton Scarsdale, my wife felt the ring slip\noff her finger at the dinner-table, and although careful search was made,\nnothing more was seen or heard of it for eighteen years, so far as we were\nconcerned.\nAt the commencement of this year, however, my wife received a letter\nfrom her half-sister (Mrs. Hodge) in New Zealand, which stated incidentally\nthat a church in which she was interested out there had received unexpected\nhelp some years ago from a curious source. Her sister (Miss White) had\nsent out from England at her request some gloves purchased at Bide's [a\nLondon shop], and on trying on a pair of these gloves she, to her astonish\nment, found inside one of them a ring containing the hair of the Duko\nof Wellington, which had evidently been drawn off the finger unconsciously\nby some one trying on the glove at Bide's. Unable to find the owner of the\nring and not liking to keep it, Mrs. Hodge thought it would be a fair thing\nto sell it and apply the proceeds to the church fund. She did so and the\npurchaser was a Mr. Frank Arkwright, of Overton, Marston, New Zealand,\nwhose grandmother had given the ring to my father, and who has most\nkindly replaced it in my possession.\nNow, here are a series of coincidences which are only likely to happen\nonce in a life-time. That of all the thousands of people who purchase gloves\nmy wife's half-sister should have lighted upon this particular pair and,\nunknown to herself and to Bide, should have sent out this ring in them to\nher sister in the Antipodes, and that there it should have been recovered in\nthe house of a cousin of the Mr. Arkwright in whose house it had been lost\neighteen years ago, surely goes to show that sometimes, at any rate, truth is\n\f228 [part\nAlice Johnson.\nstranger than fiction. As a minor coincidence I may perhaps mention that\nthe letter which, by the merest chance, happened to mention the finding of\nthe ring, was dated from Wellington, in New Zealand.\u2014I am, sir, etc.,\nW. J. Humble-Crofts.\nI wrote to Mr. Humble-Crofts, asking if any corroboration of this\naccount was obtainable, and he replied :\u2014\nWaldron Rectory, Sussex, September 19th, 1898.\nI shall be glad to put you in possession of any information you may\nrequire as to the ring, and my wife is, of course, quite willing to corroborate\nwhat I say and to copy the extract from Mrs. Hodge's letter which first\ninformed us of the discovery.\nBut I do not see how this would help you, as Mrs. Hodge had no know\nledge of the fact that we had lost any ring, and the reason why she happened\nto mention it (which she would not have done otherwise) was that my wife\nhad sent out some little help towards the church in which Mrs. Hodge was\ninterested. In acknowledging this, she proceeded to state what a curious\naddition they had received to their church fund.\nW. J. Hcmble-Crofts.\nMrs. Humble-Crofts wrote to me later :\u2014\nWaldron Rectory, Sussex, October 11th [1898].\nI beg to enclose copy of extract from letter received by me from my\nhalf-sister in New Zealand, and also extract from letter from the other half-\nsister in London about the lost ring. I also corroborate all the statements\nmade in the account of the loss and recovery of the ring, as given in the\nSpectator.\nB.

Someone buying gloves at Byde's\n\fXXXv.] 229\nCoincidences.\nmust have been trying them on, and left the ring in the gloves. I wonder\nwho that could have been ? \"\nThe next case relates to a matter of still greater urgency, and, as\nwill be seen, admits of being explained by telepathy.\nCase 16.\nThe account is an extract from a narrative printed in the Journal\nS.P.R, for July, 1898, under the title of \"Three Generations of\nPsychical Faculty.\" Professor Lodge, who obtained the account,\nsays: \u2014 \"The following narrative has been recently written by a\ngentleman well known to me, an active clergyman of the Church of\nEngland. Of his good faith there can be no doubt, and the narra\ntive may, I believe, be regarded as substantially accurate.\" Several\nincidents are described, and the writer continues :\u2014\n. . . These curious experiences generally occur in groups, and are\nsimultaneous with the close of a period of excessive mental activity. A\nvery singular one occurred last January, when I went to D. with my wife\nfor a few days' quiet. While there, I remembered that E. was in the\nneighbourhood, where I had a cousin residing, a brother of a distinguished\nartist, and that he had written to me some time before about a picture of\nhis brother's, which he wanted to sell. I at once resolved to ride over next\nmorning. Upon enquiry from the manager of the hotel, I learnt that the\nroad was bad, the weather unpromising, other directions more interesting.\nBut I stuck to my purpose and went, through the road was atrocious, and,\nwithin three or four miles of my goal, I was so dead beat that I almost\nturned back.\nHowever, I reasoned with myself that I might perhaps never have the\nchance of seeing my cousin again, and that I might even find him in some\ngreat need of my help. I continued my journey, found out his cottage and\nknocked at the door. He opened it himself and said, without showing any\nsurprise at my appearance, \" It's very good of you to come so promptly,\nbut I didn't expect you to-day.\" \" Why did you expect me at all 1 \" I said.\n\"Haven't you got my letter?\" he replied, \"I wrote to you last night.\"\n\"To W. ?\" I said. \"Yes,\" he answered. \"But I am staying at D., and\nhave had no letter,\" I said. He then took me in, and, to make a long story\nshort, I found him in very great distress, and my coming on the scene really\nproved a sort of lifebuoy to a drowning man.\nThrough the kindness of Professor Lodge, I was put into com\nmunication with the writer, who replied to my enquiries :\u2014\nJuly 24th, 1898.\nFortunately, I made notes at the time of all the incidents\nreferred to. ... As regards my cousin, I had certainly no idea that he\nwas in trouble. His letter was addressed to me at [the writer's home], and\nhe had no knowledge that I was at [D]. I have his letter somewhere, but\ncannot lay my hands upon it at the moment. Mrs. was quite as much\nstruck with this coincidence as I was. ... . .\n\f230 [part\nAlice Johnson.\nMr. was unable to send me his notes, as they were embedded\nin manuscript relating to other matters ; but Mrs. kindly sent\nthe following corroborative statement :\u2014\nJuly 25tfi, 1898.\nDear Madam,\u2014I have much pleasure in endorsing my husband's\naccount of the coincidences recorded since our marriage. . .\nThe call on his cousin from [D] was made last January, so is quite recent,\nand clearly in our minds.\n[Signed iu full] .\nA case very similar to this, but involving a more strongly marked\ncoincidence, is related by Bt. Major Kobbe\\ U.S. Array (see Pltantasnu\nof the Living, Vol. I., p. 288). While at home in New York city he\nfelt a sudden desire one day to visit a cemetery some six or seven miles\ndistant, on Long Island, where his family owned a vault. None of\nthem had ever beeu accustomed to go there and there was no reason at\nall to suggest the idea to him ; but on arriving, he found his father\nstanding at an open grave, in which he had just had placed the remains\nof an infant son who had died before Major Kobbe^s birth ; the remains\nhaving been removed from the vault of the new grave. It appeared\nthat the father had left a message at home for him to meet him there\njust at that time, but he had not gone home and consequently had not\nreceived the message.\nMr. Gurney prefixes this case by the caution that \"it is scarcely too\nmuch to say that cases of this character, in whatever number accumu\nlated, could never decisively exclude the hypothesis of accident.\"\nIt must be admitted that the same remark applies to the following\ncase, which may also be explained as due to telepathy. But I place it\nhere because, among all those I have come across in this connection,\nit is the one that seems to me most strongly to suggest a special\nintervention.\nCase 17.\nThe account was obtained by Professor Lodge, who writes :\u2014\nOctober 1Hh, 1896.\nThe enclosed statement is the record of what was carefully and precisely\ntold me yesterday by the son of the old lady, who calls himself C. B. in the\nnarrative, a personal friend of mine. He is a solicitor (and a recent M.P.)\nand thoroughly understands about evidence. He is an ideal witness, but is\ndoubtful whether it is worth recording. It may be considered either a\ncoincidence, or a telepathic leading, or an answer to prayer. As a coinci\ndence, the chances are remarkably heavy against it.\nC. B.'s account is as follows :\u2014\nAt the beginning of the present year, 1896, after fifty-two years of ideal\nmarried life, A. B. lost her husband, a clergyman then in his eighty-first\n\fXXXV.] 231\nCoincidences.\nyear. For some time before her husband's death, she had shown signs of\nfailing memory, but not in any remarkable degree. Immediately upon his\ndeath, her memory began to show signs of failure, which increased very\nrapidly. Soon after the death, A. B. was taken from the provincial town\nin which she had lived to live in London (Kensington) with her sister. By\nthe 16th May, 1896, the date which is important for the present purpose,\nA. B. had failed so much that she was not always aware that she had left her\nold home, often fancied she was there or elsewhere in her old town. She was\nquite incapable of finding her way from one part of London to another, and\nunable to state her own address in London. On the morning of 16th May\nat 10 a.m., she left her house alone, carrying a parcel which she intended to\nleave at a shop a very short distance off. I believe her sister was unaware\nof her intention, and it does not seem to have occurred to the servants that,\nas the distance was so short, there would be any risk of loss of way.\nAt 9.30 p.m., C. B., one of the three sons of A. B., arrived at his house\nin London, having travelled up from the country. He there met his sister-\nin-law, wife of another son of A. B. She informed him that A. B. had left\nhome at 10 a.m. under the circumstances stated and had not been heard of\nsince ; that in the meantime her husband and his brother had communicated\nwith Scotland Yard, and with the district police office, giving a description of\nA. B. ; that the description had been duly circulated throughout the Metro\npolitan District ; that communications had been sent to all the London\nhospitals ; and that in the opinion of the police authorities nothing further\ncould be done.\nC. B. (that is, the son who had arrived in London) waited for a few\nmoments until his wife came in. When she came in, the three people (that\nis, C. B., his wife, and his sister-in-law) drove first to A. B.'s house. They\nsaw there A. B.'s sister and the servants, but learnt nothing more than the\nfacts already stated.\nC. B. went to the local police-station with his wife, and found that all the\nnotices had been properly circulated. He asked the Chief Inspector whether\nany useful purpose could possibly be served by going to Scotland Yard.\nThe Inspector said it would be useless, as the system was such that if news\nof the missing lady were known at one police office, all the other offices\nwould instantly be made aware of it.\nC. B. then went with his wife to the house of his brother, quite close to\nwhere A. B. lives. He found that his brother was then receiving telegrams\nfrom various hospitals saying that they had seen nothing of A. B.\nBy this time it was past 10 p.m. C. B. had no idea that anything further\ncould be done. He thought that all that remained was to await news, and\nnever expected to see his mother alive again ; but as under these circum\nstances no rest is to be had by sitting still, he said to his wife that he\nintended to take the Underground Railway to Westminster, and to call at\nScotland Yard. He thought it possible that he might find some official in\nhigh authority who would give him some ideas based upon wide experience.\nC. B.'s wife offered to accompany him. Accordingly these two people went\nto Westminster Bridge. \"\"\\\nOn leaving the station C. B. asked a porter the way\\to Scotland Yard, for\nthe purpose of making enquiry as to a missing person. ^The porter directed,\n\f232 [part\nAlice Johnson.\nhim to go on to the Embankment, the Thames Embankment, and to take the\nsecond street to the left. C. B. and his wife went along the Embankment\nand took what they thought was the second street to the left. It was in fact\nthe third turn, so that they were in error. On taking the turn they could\nsee nothing of Scotland Yard and they called at a large block of flats and\nasked the porter the same question as that put to the railway porter. He\ntold them to go straight on into Parliament Street and then to turn to one\nside, C. B. forgets whether to the right or left. They followed the direction\nand found themselves in Parliament Street, Westminster clock then striking\neleven. C. B. saw a young man passing along Parliament Street and turned\nafter him a few paces in order to find out whether he should turn to the left\nor the right. The young man pointed in the right direction. C. B. then\nturned round to tell his wife, who was a few paces behind, and saw her then\ntalking to A. B.\nA. B. was then taken back to her own home, a distance of about four\nmiles. She could give no account of herself. The parcel she started with\nin the morning was still in her hands. She thought she had been twice in\nchurch. She thought she had been to the docks, evidently confusing the\nriver at Westminster Bridge with docks in her old town. She was not aware\nthat she was not in her old town until the lamps were lighted. She then\nrealised that she was lost, but I believe she did not know then that she was\nlost in London. Her purse contained no money, but it did contain two\ntickets, showing that she had been first to Tottenham Court Road, ami\nafterwards to Charing Cross. On meeting C. B., A. B. said she had never\nprayed so earnestly in her life, that \" one of you,\" meaning one of her sons,\n' ' would come. '\nNeither C. B. nor his wife felt any impulse drawing them by the way\nthey took, and which resulted in the meeting. On the contrary, they had\nno expectation of hearing of A. B. except from the Police.\n(b) Cages of \" Physical Phenomena \" in which th\u00ab evidencefor a super\nnormal cause depends on a coincidence.\nIn cases of \"physical phenomena\"\u2014effects on matter which are\nby some attributed to the action of disembodied ,spirits\u2014we have, of\ncourse, first to consider whether the conditions sufficiently exclude the\nagency of ordinary known causes,\u2014whether there can have been any\ndeception or mistake on the part of the witnesses. Supposing that\nwe have satisfied ourselves on this point, the next question bearing on\nthe spiritistic interpretation is whether any intelligence has been\nmanifested suggesting the agency of spirits.\nCase 18.\nIn this case the evidence on both the points just mentioned is\nobviously very weak ; the action of known causes is certainly not\nexcluded, and there is merely a slight indication of intelligence, which\ndepends on the incident happening just at the time it did. That is,\n\fXXXv.] 233\nCoincidences.\nit is a rather curious coincidence, but pretty clearly nothing more.\nThis is the view taken of it by the witnesses, who were two members\nof the American Branch of the Society, Mr. W. E. Ward and Dr.\nAnna Lukens. Mr. Ward writes :\u2014\n(Russell, Burdsall, and Ward, Manufacturers of Bolts and Nuts.)\nPort Chester, N.Y., May 13th, 1897.\nDear Dr. Hodgson.\u2014 ... A queer thing happened in the Doctor's\n[Dr. Lukens'] office last Sunday afternoon. We had been talking about our\nold friend Professor Cope, who died about four weeks before we returned\nhome from our three months' trip through Mexico, California, and the\nNorth-West.\nI was referring to Cope's interest in psychical matters, and saying how\nsatisfactory it would be if we could get some reliable report from him of his\nimpressions of the real life he has so lately entered into. And immediately\nthe Doctor's large musical box commenced plaging, and continued to play for\nover five minutes, to our great and almost bewildering astonishment, and\nceased playing only when I commenced trying to account for such an\nunexpected entertainment through ordinary natural methods. Just as\nsoon as I remarked how it might be accounted for, it stopped as abruptly\nas it began.\nThe instrument had 7wt been wound up in over three months, and when\nlast used, if there had remained unused any tension of the spring, it might\nhave been released long before by the jarring it had been subject to through\nthe occasional shifting of the furniture in the room. . . .\nW. E. Ward.\nMr. Ward writes later :\u2014\nPort Chester, N.Y., May 26th, 1897.\n. . . The most simple material cause I can attribute the playing to\nis mainly surplus spring tension, for some unknown reason unexpended\nduring the last use of the instrument and held until favouring conditions of\ntemperature would probably release any frictional restraint in the working\nparts, together with an imperceptible vibration from unnoticed jar, [which]\nmight have aided in removing the obstruction to the playing.\nA curious part of the experience, which I perhaps omitted to mention\nin my last, was the response I received to a mental question I asked some\nten or fifteen minutes after the playing ceased. The question was addressed\nto Professor Cope in about this form, \" Edward, are we indebted to you for\nthe music we have just heard?\" and immediately a response of three loud\nraps came on the floor apparently quite near me, but this was after Dr. Lukens\nhad left the room, so is unsupported by another witness.\nDr. Lukens will probably write and tell you what her opinion is about\nthe experience. I don't think she has any faith in Cope having anything to\ndo with the playing. . . .\nW. E. Ward.\nDr. Lukens writes :\u2014\n1068, Lexington Ave., May 30th, 1897.\nDear Dr. Hodgson,\u2014I have nothing to add to Mr. Ward's report of\n,the musical box experience except to say that I doubt very much that it was\nB 2\n\f234. [PAKT\nAlice Johnson.\nproduced by any supernormal cause. It was, indeed, a rather startling\ncircumstance that, as we sat in my office that Sunday afternoon (May 9th)\ntalking of Professor Cope and wishing we might get some report from him,\nthe musical box should at that moment begin to play, and continue for\na few minutes. But I am inclined to believe it was merely a coincidence,\ndue probably to the natural causes Mr. Ward suggested in his last letter\nto you.\nAnna Lukens [M.D.].\nCask 19.\nThis case was brought to our notice as one of supposed \" spirit-\nphotography,\" the importance of which seemed to be considerably\nenhanced by its involving a very well-authenticated coincidence. It\nwill be seen, however, that the lady who took the photograph\u2014\nMiss S. R. Corbet\u2014was from the first fully alive to the inconclusive\nnature of the evidence for any supernormal agency being concerned\nin its production. We are indebted in the first instance for informa\ntion about the case to Lady Fitzgerald, through whose kindness\nProfessor Barrett was put into communication with the persons con\ncerned. From a mass of correspondence on the subject, Professor\nBarrett put together in June, 1895, the account printed below, which\nwas afterwards corrected and signed by Miss Corbet.\nMiss Sybell Corbet, when staying with her sister, Lady S., at D. Hall\n[assumed name], took a photograph of the library in the afternoon of\nDecember 5th, 1891, between 2 and 3 o'clock. The exposure was rather a\nlong one. No one was present with Miss Corbet when the picture was\ntaken, but on developing the negative, the head and body of an elderly\ngentleman appeared seated on a high-backed, old oak chair, one arm resting\non the arm of the chair, the other arm of the figure and the legs being\ninvisible. The figure, in fact, only went down to the waist, and though the\nface was rather indistinct, it appeared to have a short beard. When the\npicture was shown to one of the nearest relatives of Lord D., the late owner\nof D. Hall, she thought it exactly like him ; others, however, who knew\nhim, think it too indistinct to be sure of any likeness. Strangely enough, it\nturned out that the funeral of Lord D. was taking place on the very same\nday and hour at which the photograph was taken.\nMiss Corbet is sure the plate had not been exposed before, and was one\nof a parcel of dry Ilford plates. Unfortunately, the exposure being some\nwhat long, she was not in the room the whole time, and did not lock the\ndoors when she left the room ; but the only men in the house were her\nyoungest brother, the butler, and two footmen, and all these four were\nyoung men and beardless. In answer to inquiries, Miss Corbet states that\nthe servants would not be at all likely to have entered the room, and her\nbrother declares he did not. None of them would, she is certain, be likely\nto play a practical joke, and even if they did, the difficulty would be to\nexplain the production of an older, bearded figure, without legs, and one\nconsidered by some of his near relatives to be very like Lord D., and entirely\nunlike any men living in the house.\n\fXXXv.] .235\nCoincidences.\nThe men were all young and clean-shaven, except Miss Corbet's brother,\nwho had a moustache, and who is not in the least like the figure indepen\ndently of this.\nI certify the foregoing account to be correct in every particular.\nSybbll R. Corbet.\nThe date is fixed by two separate notes made by Miss Corbet,\u2014\nat a time, when, as explained below, she had not observed the\ncoincidence,\u2014as follows :\u2014\nEntry in photographic note-book.\u2014December 5th, 1891 : subject, library,\nD. ; exposure, 60 minutes ; plate, Ilford Ordinary ; hour, 2 to 3 p.m.\nEntry in diary.\u2014December 5th, 1891 : Lord D. buried at W. Church [two\nmiles from D.]\nThe following extracts from letters written by Miss Corbet give\nfurther details.\nKingsland House, Shrewsbury, May 2nd, 1895.\nThere are the most contradictory opinions about the likeness of the figure\nin my D. photograph to Lord D. My sister thought it so like him that she\nbegged me to look out the date on which I had taken it, when I first noticed\nthat it was taken at the very time of Lord D.'s funeral. Since that, people\nwho knew him well have declared it was not in the least like him ; others\nwho knew him equally well that it was. But to my mind it is not clear\nenough to form a very definite opinion about, as the features are hidden by\na standard lamp.\nIt is a curious coincidence ;\u2014an unaccountable figure appearing in a\nphotograph taken at that particular date, and that the figure should, in the\nopinions of some who knew him most intimately, resemble Lord D.\nJune 12th, 1895.\nYou ask if there is any possibility of the plate having being exposed\nbefore. So far as I am aware, lutue, as I always keep a very careful account\nof every plate 1 expose ; or rather I should say, no probability, as I have\nnever exposed a plate twice without becoming aware of my mistake on taking\nout the dark slides ; and, moreover, I had in those days never taken a human\nfigure\u2014excepting as a minute object in a landscape\u2014so the figure would still\nbe unaccounted for. However, I am told by some photographers and others\nthat the pre-exposure may happen during the sensitising of the dry plate.\nOf this, of course, I know nothing. The fact remains a curious one, I\nthink, although some photographers declare there is nothing odd in it\u2014mere\naccident and chance. But I quite agree with you that, as it is impossible to\nprove that no one entered the room, it cannot be regarded \"as affording\nindubitable evidence of a ' spirit photograph.' \"\nJuly 22nd, 1895.\nI did not develop the plate until August of the following year, when I first\nbecame aware of the presence of an unexpected figure ; but it was not until my\neldest sister, Mrs. R., suggested a likeness to the late Lord D., and asked me\nif it was taken before or after his death, that I referred to my note-book and\ndiary, and found that it was on the day of the funeral (he died in London,\n\f236 [part\nAlice Johnson.\nbut was buried in the Church near D.). On later inquiry, I also discovered\nthat the time corresponded, the funeral being a little late, in consequence of\nthe lateness of the special train ; in fact, that during part of the exposure,\nthe service was waiting the arrival of some of the principal mourners. My\nsister, Lady S., was renting D. Hall at this time ; and so far as I can\nremember, several of us (my sisters) were there when I arranged the camera,\nafter which we all went out, leaving the plate exposed, and the room quite\nempty ! I had no particular interest in [the] arm-chair, and have never been\nable to discover that Lord D. was in the habit of using it, as he usually\noccupied a smaller room, on the ground floor, when alone.\nIn the photograph, which is here reproduced, half of the upper\npart of the figure of a man appears seated in the large chair on the\nleft. The high stand, carrying a flower-pot, in front of the chair seems\nto cut off the other half of the face and body of the figure. The lower\npart of the body and the legs are entirely wanting ; the head is semi-\ntransparent and the face very indistinct. A vague semblance of an\neye-brow, an eye, and a nose is seen on careful examination to be\nreally the carving of the back of the chair showing through.1 It is\nimpossible to make out with certainty whether the face wears a beard\nor not, but the head appears to be quite bald, and there is something\nlike a stock round the neck, which adds to the appearance of age.\nThese features were perhaps mainly instrumental in suggesting the\nlikeness.\nWith regard to the possibility that one of the footmen might have\ngot taken, either accidentally or as a practical joke, Miss Corbet points\nout that the dress of the figure is apparently that of a gentleman,\nwhereas her sister's footmen always wore livery, although at that time\nthey were in mourning. She thinks it more possible, although very\nimprobable, that some stranger came in for a few minutes ; the butler\ndeclared that no one did so, but, unfortunately, enquiry was not made\nuntil some time after the event.\nThe incompleteness of the figure, together with the supposition\nthat the room was empty while the photograph was being taken,\nhaving suggested the possibility that it was produced by something\nother than an ordinary man, the interest of this suggestion was much\nheightened by the undoubted fact that Lord D.'s funeral was actually-\noccurring at the time.\nProfessor Barrett, however, with the aid of Mr. Gordon Salt,\nexperimented on the effects that could be produced by the transitory\nintroduction of a figure during a long exposure of a plate. The results\nthus obtained by a person coming into the room, sitting on a chair\n1 All these points, as well as the semi-transparency of the figure as compared with\nthe solid objects surrounding it, are naturally shown more clearly in the photograph\nthan in the reproduction.\n\f\f\fXXXV.] 237\nCoincidences.\nand moving his legs, were so very like the reputed ghost picture that\nProfessor Barrett writes :\u2014\nSeptember 5th, 1895.\nI can see how the \" Ghost \" picture may have occurred, as I have\nsucceeded in reproducing it almost exactly. I believe that one of the\nservants came into the room, sat down in the chair, crossed his legs and then\nuncrossed them, looked down for a moment and then at the camera, saw he\nwas being taken, so got up and went away, having been in the chair about\n20 to 30 seconds. This will give the ghost of an apparently older man from\na young man, with no legs, and a semi-transparent face, &c.\nProfessor Barrett's photograph is also reproduced here, and will be\nseen to be very similar in appearance to the other, only half of\nthe upper part of the figure\u2014the half most strongly lighted \u2014 being\nshown, and this being semi-transparent. There are very faint indi\ncations of features in the face, and the chin, being abnormally long\nand with no distinct outline, looks as though there were a short\nwhite beard. A similar indefiniteness of outline on the right side\nof the collar simulates the folds of a stock, and, as in Miss Corbet's\nphotograph, the legs are entirely absent.\nFurther light was thrown on the possible method of production\nof Miss Corbet's photograph by Dr. H. D. R. Kingston, of Stor-\nmont Lodge, Willesden, N.W., an Associate of the Society, who has\nhad a long and varied experience in the investigation of \"spirit\nphotography.\" He observed a point which,, though not at all con\nspicuous at first sight, is very evident when once attention has been\ndrawn to it,\u2014viz., that almost all the white lines or marks in the\nphotograph are doubled, the brightest or best-lighted lines being most\nso. The doubling is clear, for instance, in some photographs and\ncandles standing on two tables, various parts of some chairs, some\nof the handles of the drawers of a cabinet, and finally in the books\nand mouldings of the bookshelves 1 In each case there is a faint\nimage to the right side of and slightly lower down than the bright\nimage of the same object. This shows that the camera must have\nbeen moved slightly during the exposure, as no movement of the\nfurniture could have produced such complete uniformity of the double\nappearance. Since one set of images is much clearer than the other,\nthe camera must have been moved either near the beginning or near\nthe end of the exposure. Miss Corbet, however, informs us that the\ncamera was placed in the open doorway and partly outside it, and\nthinks it possible that she herself may have shaken it in passing out of\n1 The doubling is not shown very satisfactorily in the reproduction, but is fairly\nclear in the photograph standing on the small table to the extreme right, also in\nanother photograph in a high stand on the large table and a candle to the right of\nthis, and may be seen more faintly in the books.\n\f238 [part\nAlice Johnson.\nthe room. This also makes it possible that another person passing by\nmay have moved it slightly without coming into the room at all.\nIt is important to ascertain whether or not the \"ghost\"\u2014the\nfigure in the chair\u2014has a double outline as well as the other objects\nin the room, as, if so, it would prove that the figure had been\nin the chair during the whole of the exposure, and, therefore,\ncould not be that of the person who moved the camera. Unfor\ntunately, it is altogether so faint, and its outline is so much blurred\nthat it is impossible to make certain of this point. So far, however,\nas there can be said to be any double outline, it clearly does not\ncorrespond with the double outline of the other objects. It is possible\nto trace more than one outline in the head and stock or collar, but\nimpossible to say that the one on the right is lower down than the one\non the left ; if anything, it is slightly higher up. Further, there are\ntwo distinct images of the elbow, but one is resting on the arm of the\nchair, while the other projects some way below it. This seems to\nprove conclusively that the figure\u2014unlike all the other objects in the\nroom\u2014 moved during the exposure, and that the multiplication of its\noutlines was not due to the movement of the camera.\nThus the camera may have been moved by some one who came into\nthe room while the photograph was being taken, and Professor Barrett's\nexperiments prove that the semi-transparency and whole appearance of\nthe figure may have been caused by the person in question sitting in\nthe chair for a short time, and moving about in it while he did so.\nIn the remaining four cases given under this head an apparently\ntelepathic impression, relating to the death of a distant person, is\ndescribed, the \" physical phenomenon \" being stated to occur at the\nsame time. In two of the cases the object affected had some special\nassociation with the dying person. But the evidence for the physical\neffect having been produced supernormally is generally very slight, and\nI do not think that the association with an apparently telepathic\nincident can reasonably be held to add any weight to this evidence.\nCase 20.\nFrom the \"Appendix to the Report on Phantasms and Presentiment* \"\nin the Proceedings of the American Society for Psydiical Research, p. 433.\n[Miss M. O. A. sends the following account.]\nFebruary 8th, 1888.\n\"A strange and curious dream came to mo one night last autumn, which,\nfrom the events that followed, made a deep impression upon me. I dreamed\nthat my mother's brother died, and I went to Brooklyn to attend the funeral,\nbut was intensely annoyed at arriving too late, as the service was over, and\nthe body being carried out of the house. I saw my aunt and cousins, but\ncould not speak to them. In the midst of this distressing scene I awoke,\n\f\u00bb\n\f\fXXXV.] 239\nCoincidences.\nhearing a loud crash, as of something falling. This was a decided reality,\nbut I could discover nothing in my room that had been disturbed. In the\nmorning I related my dream, and felt as though I should hear some news\nthat day. The noise I heard was accounted for by the falling of a weight in\na tall clock which stood in the hall. Two days passed, and on the morning\nof the third day the paper contained a notice of my uncle's death (my\nfather's brother), stating that he died on the night I had my dream. It was\nthen too late for me to go to the funeral ; for some unknown reason I had\nnot been notified by the family, although my dream had informed me,\nl>erhups, of the very hour that he died. ^ q ^ \u201e\n[In reply to Dr. Hodgson's inquiries, Miss A. informed him that the date\nof the dream was September 2nd, 1887, and sent the following statements\nfrom two ladies to whom she had related it in the morning before the news\nof the death came.]\n\"Philadelphia, March 4th, 1888.\n\" My sister's dream of our uncle's death, as related by her, occurred at\nthe time she mentions. I was visiting her at the time, and distinctly\nremember being told the dream, and being asked if I had heard a peculiar\nsound in the night. The sound I did not hear, but was present when it\nwas discovered that the weight of the hall clock had fallen down. My\nuncle's death occurred at that time, and the news of it was so late in\nreaching us that we were unable to attend the funeral. jSAbEllA a \u00bb\n\"March, 1888.\n\" Miss A. related to me the dream which she had relative to her uncle's\ndeath the morning afterward, and I also heard the noise made by the fall of\nthe clock-weight the same night. \u201e elizabeth g jj \u00bb\nThis case is one of the best^evidenced that I have found of this\ntype. It will be observed that the object affected \u2014the clock-weight\u2014\nhad only a very remote connection, if any, with the dying person, and\nit is hardly possible to regard its fall at the time of his death as any\nthing but a mere coincidence.\nThe dream may no doubt have been telepathic\u2014though its reference\nto the wrong person is a reason for doubting this\u2014-but even if it were,\nit does not, I think, add to the significance of the clock-incident ; a\nclock-weight might as easily fall at the moment that its owner was\nhaving a telepathic impression as at any other time.\nIn the next case the great anxiety of the percipient about the\ndying person is a weak point, as this,\u2014rather than telepathy,\u2014may\nhave caused the hallucination experienced at the time of his death.\nCase 21.\n[This case is slightly abridged from an account given in the \" Appendix\nto the Report on Phantasms and Presentiments,\" Proceeditujs of the\nAmerican S.F.R., p. 429.]\n\f240 Alice Johnson.\nOur attention was first drawn to this case by the following account, which\nappeared in the Oil City Derrick (Oil City, Pa.), December 12th, 1887 :\u2014\n\" Depot-master George Fry, whose brother Gideon died at Big Rapids,\nMich., Sunday night, December 4th, had a strange presentiment of his\ndeath. On Monday morning Mr. Fry received a telegram, announcing the\ndeath of his brother, but giving no further information, and in the afternoon,\nin conversation with a Derrick reporter, said, ' I wrote a letter to Gid last\nnight, and just as I had finished it I glanced up and noticed the clock had\nstopped. I got up and wound the clock and pulled out my watch to set it\nby. It was 15 minutes to 10 ; I set the clock and, just as I started it, I\nheard the words, \" I'm gone ! I'm gone ! \" It was Gid's voice, and it seemed\nto come out of the clock. I heard it as distinctly as I ever heard anything\nin my life. It startled me and I related the occurrence to my family. I am\nno Spiritualist, but I believe that must have been the time, and those the\nlast words of brother Gid.' Yesterday, Mr. Fry showed the Derrick a\nletter from Big Rapids, giving an account of his brother's last moments.\nThe letter stated that Gideon died at 15 minutes of 10, Sunday night,\nDecember 4th, and his last words were, 'I'm gone ! I'm gone ! ' the identical\ntime and words as related to the reporter Monday last. . . .\"\n\" In a later account Mr. Fry is described as saying\u2014\n\" . . . . I am not a Spiritualist and never had any such experience\nbefore. The clock that stopped belonged to brother Gid. . . .\"\n\" In reply to our inquiries Mr. Fry wrote as follows : \u2014\n\" 106, Sycamore-street, Oil City, Pa., July 9th, 1888.\n\" Richard Hodgson, Esq.,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014The account of my experience\nin regard to my brother's death is true ; that is, the way the Oil City or\nPittsburgh papers had it. ... \"G W Fry\"\nLater some further evidence was received through Mr. R. W. Criswell,\nEditor of the Oil City Derrick, who obtained, in January, 1889, the\nstatements that follow from various witnesses in the case. He remarks that\n\" George Fry has been a resident of Oil City for 25 years. He is now about\n39 years of age, a member in good standing of the Second Presbyterian\nChurch and a man who is regarded as a good citizen in every respect. At\nthe time of the above occurrence he was depot-master, employed by the\nAllegheny Valley and New York and Western Pennsylvania Railroads.\"\nMr. Fry states : \u2014\n\" My brother Gideon and I had been much together and were more\nintimate in our associations than other members of the family. I was much\nattached to him. On Friday, December 2nd [1887] I received a telegram\nfrom his physician at Big Rapids that ho was ill and could not live over 24\nhours. I had known of his illness, but he had not been regarded in a\ndangerous condition. I could not leave my business to go to him and I was\ngreatly troubled on this account. I was thinking of him almost constantly.\nIn church, Sunday, he was the chief subject of my prayers. Sunday evening,\nafter church, I sat down to write him a letter and while writing it, I observed\nthat the clock in the room\u2014his clock, by the way,\u2014had stopped. I got up to\nstart it, and looking at my watch saw that it had been stopped but a few\n\fXXXV.] 241\nCoincidences.\nminutes. I started to wind it up and found that it had not run down. As I\nmured the hands around, a strange light flooded the face of the clock, and\nthe words issued from it in the voice of brother Gid, ' I'm gone, I'm gone ! '\nThe words were distinctly uttered. 1 was so impressed that brother Gid had\ndied at that moment and that these were his last words, that I hastily sealed\nthe letter, laid it away, and did not mail it. I noted the time as 9.45.\n. Next morning early before going to work, I told my wife of the\nincident. At about 11.30 that forenoon I was handed a telegram that had\nbeen received by my brother, Daniel P. Fry, in these words only, ' Gid is\ndead. Come to Montague.' This was signed by my sister Lizzie, who was\nat Big Rapids. That afternoon I told S. W. Turner, a newspaper reporter,\nof the death of my brother ; and also told him ... of the strange\npresentiment of the evening before. I had received no word of my brother's\ndeath, except the message given above, nor did I receive any more intelligence\nregarding it until some days later, when a letter came from my sister, giving\nparticulars. This letter added that Gideon had died at 8.45 Sunday evening,\nDecember 4th, and his last words were ' I'm gone, I'm gone.' It was at 9.45\nthat I had heard the voice in the clock ; but the difference in time between\nBig Rapids and Oil City is just enough to cover this discrepancy. My sister,\nwho was with Gideon when he died, is now at home, in Oil City, and she tells\nme that for some time before he died he was unconscious, and imagined that\nI was with him. When any one would leave the bedside, he would say\n'George, don't leave me.' \"\nThe following statement was obtained from Mrs. Fry :\u2014\n\" Oil City, January 13th, 1889.\n\" In regard to the presentiment of Gideon P. Fry's death, December 4th,\n1887, my husband told me, early Monday mornmg, December 5th, 1887, of\nthe voice in the clock, which he had heard the preceding evening.\n\"Mrs. Kate J. Fry.\"\nMr. S. W. Turner, the reporter above referred to, gives a statement, dated\nJanuary 13th, 1889, substantially the same as the original newspaper account\nwhich he had written at the time, but somewhat briefer, and omitting the\nincident of the clock stopping. On January 18th, 1889, Mr. Turner wrote a\nmore detailed account, in which he mentions that Mr. Fry told him the clock\nhad stopped while he was writing a letter to his brother. He continues :\u2014\n[Mr. Fry] \"said the exact time was 9.45.\n\"On the following Sunday, the 11th, Mr. Fry reminded me of our con\nversation on the 5th, and showed me a letter from his sister, Lizzie\nThompson, dated Big Ripids, giving particulars of the death of Gideon.\nThis letter, which I read, said that Gideon had died at 8.45 p.m., Sunday,\nDecember 4th, 1887, and his last words were ' I'm gone, I'm gone ! '\n\" With the permission of Mr. Fry, I went to the telegraph offices here\nWednesday, December 14th, and . . searched their files for copies of\nany messages relating to the death of Gideon Fry. Below is a copy of the\nonly message bearing on the case :\u2014\n\" 'Big Rapids, Mich., December otlt.\n\" ' Daniel P. Fry, Oil City, Pa. Gid is dead ; come to Montague.\n'Lizzie K. Thompson.'\n\f242 [part\nAlice Johnson.\n\"This message was received in Oil City at 9.40 Monday morning,\nDecember 5th. No message was received at the postal telegraph office. . . .\n\"S. W. Turner.\"\nWith regard to the clock stopping, it may, of course, be supposed\nthat Mr. Fry, in his great anxiety about his brother, forgot to\nwind up the clock the night before. Against this we have to set his\nstatement that he found on investigation that it had not run down.\nBut this statement does not occur in the newspaper account, presum\nably given by him at the time, but only in the narrative written rather\nmore than a year later. In the agitation of the moment he may easily\nhave omitted to notice whether the clock had really run down or not,\nand may have assumed afterwards that he must have taken this\nelementary precaution. On the other hand, as a \" depot-master,\" he\nwas probably more careful instinctively to keep his clocks in good\norder than the average man would be, so that it is comparatively\nunlikely that he forgot to wind it up. Even if he did, this would not\ncause it to stop at the moment of his brother's death ; it would only\ngive it a better chance of doing so.\nThen, again, what is the evidence that the clock really did stop \"i.\nThe detail is omitted from the corroboratory statement of Mrs.\nFry, and it is omitted from one of the three statements of the news\npaper reporter, being mentioned in the other two. I do not think,\nhowever, that much stress can be laid on these omissions, as it is very\ndoubtful whether any of the witnesses realised that the stopping of the\nclock\u2014supposing it to be causally connected with the brother's death\u2014\nwas at all more remarkable than the hallucination\u2014telepathic or\nsubjective \u2014of the voice that seemed to come out of the clock.\nThe connection of the hallucination with the clock suggests, no\ndoubt, that the same agency produced both the veridical impression on\nthe man and the effect of stopping the clock. On the other hand, the\nclock face may simply have acted as a point de repere for the hallucina\ntion because Mr. Fry's attention was directed to it at the moment, and\nany other object would perhaps have served this purpose equally well.\nThe next case is not, strictly speaking, at first hand, but depends\non the kind of evidence that was called, in Phantasms of the Living,\n\" second-hand, as good as first \"\u2014evidence, namely, from a witness\nwho knew of the percipient's experience at the time and before it was\nascertained whether or not it was in any sense veridical.\nCase 22.\nThe account was sent by Mr. A. Glardon, whose interesting\nexperiments in thought-transference at a distance are well-known.\n(See Journal S.P.R., Vol. VI., p. 98, and Vol. VII., p. 325).\n\fXXXV.] 243\nCoincidences.\nThe name of the witness was given us in confidence. Mr. Glardon\nwrites :\u2014\nTour de Peilz, Vaud, August 31st, 1894.\nA friend of mine, Mrs. F. . a daughter of the well-known geologist, ,\nhas related to me a rather striking instance of telepathy of which she was a\nwitness.\nA few years ago, she was sitting on the rocks above the sea, at Nervi,\nnear Genoa, where she resides habitually, with an American young girl, who\nhas since become her son's wife. The young lady, her gloved hands resting\non her knees, was talking with Mrs. F., when all at once she gave a slight\nscream.\n\" What is the matter ?\" asked Mrs. F.\n\" My finger has been stung.\"\nShe took off her glove, and discovered that a ring of hers had snapped.\nShe looked at it with a scared look and exclaimed :\n\" Oh, Mrs. F., a dear friend of mine has just died.\"\nShe went on to explain that the ring had been given her by a young man\nat the time of her leaving the United States and that he had said : \"If I\nwere to die, this ring would apprize you of the fact.\"\nMrs. F. pooh-poohed the matter, being not herself a believer in psychical\nmatters. But, a few weeks later, came the news of that young man's death.\nMrs. F. could not tell me if it was on the very day of the breaking of the\nring ; but she has little doubt about it.\nI doubt if Mrs. F. reads English, but if you write to her, she can, I dare\nsay. get your letter translated and will doubtless answer you, confirming\nmy report.\nHer address is Auo Glakdon\nWe wrote to Mrs. F. asking for her recollection of the incident and\nits date, and also whether she could obtain for us any statement from\nthe lady to whom it actually occurred, and she replied as follows : \u2014\nNervi, le 10 Octobre, 1894.\nMonsieur,\u2014En reponse a votre honoree.lettre, je ne puis que confirmer\nles faits dont Monsieur Aug.

Quelques semaines\napres ce fait qui l'avait peniblement emotionnee elle recut la nouvelle de la\nmort de ce monsieur arrivee a la meme date et meme heure que celle de\nla rupture de la bague.\nJe ne pense pas que cette dame desire maintenant que son nom soit\npublie, cause pour laquelle je ne puis vous en faire part. . . .\n(Signed in full) E. F.\n\f244 [part\nAlice Johnson.\nFurther inquiries as to the evidence for the closeness of the\ncoincidence remained unanswered, and we have been unable to obtain\nany more information about it.\nIt will be observed that though this case, assuming the complete\naccuracy of the report, points primd facie to telekinetic agency\u2014an\neffect produced by unknown means on matter at a distance\u2014it may\neasily be explained as merely telepathic\u2014an effect produced super-\nnormally on mind at a distance (Mr. Glardon, in fact, calls it an\ninstance of telepathy). It may be supposed that a telepathic impulse\nfrom the dying man reached the subliminal consciousness of the\npercipient and produced a motor instead of a sensory effect, which\nled to an involuntary muscular spasm in the fingers, resulting in the\nbreaking of the ring. We should expect that a motor impulse\noriginating in this way would attach itself, if possible, to some object\nassociated with the agent, just as we should expect chat a sensory\nimpulse telepathically started would produce a hallucination represent\ning the agent, either in form or in voice. We have many instances\nrecorded of motor effects apparently due to telepathy, though they do\nnot seem to be so frequent as sensory impressions from the same\ncause. But it is obvious that as long as any human being is in\ncontact with the object affected, as in this case of ring breaking, we\nmust put down the effect to the action, conscious or unconscious, of\nthat human being, as in all cases of so-called \" physical phenomena \"\nwhere the objects moved are in contact with the so-called \" medium.\"\nCase 23.\nIn the following case, an intelligent message, apparently relating\nto a death that had occurred a few hours before, was received through\nraps. I have ascertained that the death took place in 1887. The\naccount, dated November 29th, 1890, was written by Mr. Myers,\nfrom details furnished to him by the witnesses, who, he says, were\n\" well-known to me and entirely trustworthy.\" We are not allowed\nto print their names. There can, I think, be no doubt as to what the\nname given through the raps was intended to be.\nA group of persons in a country houso were amusing themselves by\ngetting a table to tilt out messages. The name of a deceased friend\u2014of\nwhom they were not consciously thinking\u2014was given (as often happens in\nsuch cases) as the communicating intelligence. Suddenly the tilts changed\nto raps, which gave an unintelligible sentence. (I am obliged to change the\nname, but I give what is a fair parallel.) \" Spare us Maroribnks.\" While\nthey puzzled over this message, a ring was heard at the front door. The\nhost went out to greet some guests fresh from London. These guests\nbrought with them the news that Mr. Marjoribanks, a valued friend of all the\nparty, had expired suddenly a few hours before. It should be added that\nthe deceased friend whose name had been given as \"control \" was also a\n\fXXXv.] 245\nCoincidences.\nfriend of Mr. Marjoribanks, and that Mr. Marjoribanks, whose life was a\nvery valuable one, had been supposed to be in perfect health.\nWith regard to the raps here described, I need hardly say that\nthere is no reason to doubt the good faith of the witnesses ; but we\nrequire also to exclude the possibility that any of them might have\nproduced the raps automatically and unconsciously. For my own\npart, I believe it possible that the most honest persons may occa\nsionally act in this way, with entire unconsciousness of what they are\ndoing. But the interest and importance of the incident lies in the\nfact of the intelligence manifested by the raps, however they were\ncaused. Even if we adopt the supposition that one of the party\nrapped automatically, at least information unknown to any of them\nwas elicited,\u2014as information unknown to any one present is some\ntimes received through automatic writing.\nIn connection with this interpretation, it may be instructive to\nrefer to an incident described by Mr. E. Gurney {Phantasms of the\nLiving, Vol. I., pp. 76 to 78) to show that apparently genuine instances\nof thought-transference may sometimes occur even in connection with\nfraudulent phenomena. The following is Mr. Gurney's account, some\nwhat abridged :\u2014\nOn September 2nd, 1885, Mr. F. W. H. Myers, Dr. A. T. Myers, and\nthe present writer paid an impromptu visit to a professional \"'medium\"\n[a person who has been detected in the production of spurious phenomena]\nin a foreign town. We had decided beforehand on a name on which to con\ncentrate our thoughts, with a view to getting it reproduced. The medium,\nher daughter, and the three visitors sat round a table on which their hands\nwere placed, and the present writer pointed to the successive letters of a\nprinted alphabet ; at intervals the sound of a rap was heard and the letter\nthus indicated was written down. Now these conditions could not have\nbeen considered adequate, had the result been that the name in our minds\nwas correctly given ; for though our two companions were not apparently\nlooking at us and not in contact with us, it might have been supposed that\nsome involuntary and unconscious movement on our part revealed to one of\nthem at what points to make the raps. But as the result turned out, it will\nbe seen, I think, that this objection does not apply. The name that had\nbeen selected was John Henry Pratt. The result obtained in the way\ndescribed was JONHN YESROS AT. From the N in the fifth\nplace to the end, Dr. Myers and myself regarded the letters that were being\ngiven as purely fortuitous and as forming gibberish ; and though Mr.\nF. W. H. Myers detected a method in them, he was as far as we were from\nexpecting the successive letters before they appeared. On inspection, the\nmethod becomes apparent. If in three places a contiguous letter be sub\nstituted, the complete name will be found to be given thus :\u2014\nR PT\nJON HNYES ROSAT,\nthe first word being phonetically spelt and the other two being correct\n\f246 [PABT\nAlice Johnson.\nanagrams. It is highly improbable that such an amount of resemblance\nwas accidental ; and it is difficult to suppose that it was due to muscular\nindications unconsciously given by us in accordance with an uneouacunu\narrangement of the letters in our minds in phonetic and anagrammatic order.\nIf these suppositions be excluded, the only alternative will be thought-\ntransference.\nBut in whatever way the knowledge of the letters or syllables reached\nthe \" medium's\" mind, I see no reason to think that the expression of it by\nrapa was other than a conscious act. The sounds were such as would be\nmade by gently tapping the foot against the wooden frame of the table ;\nand at \u00ab subsequent trial with one of these so-called \"mediums\"\u2014the\ndaughter\u2014I managed by very gradually advancing my own foot to receive\non it first a part and ultimately the whole of the impact. The movement\nrequired to make the raps may have become semi-automatic from long\nhabit, but can hardly have been unconscious.\n(c) Premonitions.\nI include Premonitions among the class of Coincidences having a\ndoubtful claim to causal production, partly because of the difficulty of\nforming any satisfactory theory of what mental action or faculty cau\nbe involved in a genuine premonition,\u2014that is, a real foreseeing of a\nfuture event which could not by any exercise of the reasoning powers\nbe inferred from a knowledge of present or past conditions. There\nare, of course, a great many so-called premonitions or presentiments\nwhich can be explained by supposing some supernormal knowledge of\npresent facts ; and a large number of predictions no doubt bring\nabout their own fulfilment in various ways through self-suggestion or\nsuggestion acting on others. All these explanations have been fully\ndiscussed in articles on the subject that have appeared from time\nto time in our Proceedings (see especially \" On the Evidence for\nPremonitions,\" by Mrs. H. Sidgwick, Vol. \"V., p. 288; and \"The\nSubliminal Self\u2014The Relation of Supernormal Phenomena to Time\u2014\nPrecognition,\" by Mr. F. W. H. Myers, Vol. XI., p. 408). I may\nrefer also to a more recent article by Dr. G. B. Erruacora in the\nRivista di Studi Psichici (of which a translation, under the title,\n\" Sur la possibilit\u00e9 des theories rationnelles de la premonition,\"\nappeared in the Annates des Sciences Psychiques for Jan.-Feb., 1 899),\nshowing how other cases may be explained by a supposed combination\nof telaethesia and telepathy, and discussing theories of interpretation\nof those residual cases that may be called genuinely premonitory.\nApart from all theoretical difficulties, however, the cases I give under\nthis head afford but very inadequate evidence of a real premonitory\nfaculty. Some of them share the weakness so frequently found in\nsuch cases in that the prediction does not refer to any stated time of\nfulfilment, and therefore allows comparatively large scope for\n\fXXXV.] 247\nCoincidences.\naccidental coincidence. Some, e.g., the predictions of the results of\nraces, refer to events in which only a small number of alternatives\nwas possible, which again, of course, increases the chance of accidental\nfulfilment.\nIn the first two cases given the fulfilment of the premonition seems\nclearly accidental, although highly improbable.\nCase 24.\nThis case is Swift's prediction\u2014if prediction it can be called\u2014of\nthe discovery of the then unknown satellites of Mars. The coincidence\nis well-known, at least to astronomers, but as I have not been able to\nfind any complete account of the relation of the prediction to the\nactual facts, it seems worth while putting together all the details\nrelevant to it.\nThe following passage occurs in Gulliver's Travels (published in\n1726) Part III., Chapter III :\u2014\n[The astronomers of Laputa] \" have likewise discovered two lesser stars,\nor satellites, which revolve about Mars, whereof the innermost is distant\nfrom the centre of the primary planet exactly three of his diameters, and the\noutermost five ; the former revolves in the space of ten hours, and the latter\nin twenty-one and a half ; so that the squares of their periodical times are\nvery near in the same proportion with the cubes of their distance from the\ncentre of Mars : which evidently shows them to be governed by the same\nlaw of gravitation that influences the other heavenly bodies.\"\nIn order to judge how unlikely it was that any one should make\nthis guess, it is necessary to consider how much was known about the\nplanets and their satellites at the time. The two outermost planets,\nUranus and .Neptune, had not been discovered; but the other six\nprincipal ones, Mercury, Venus, the Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn,\nhad been known for centuries. Four out of the five satellites of\nJupiter had been discovered, and five out of the eight now known to\nbelong to Saturn. As Mars comes between the Earth with one\nsatellite and Jupiter with four, it was not unnatural, in making a\nguess about its satellites, to imagine that their number was two.\nWith regard to the theory of gravitation, this had been established by\nthe publication of Newton's Principia in 1687, and the law as to the\nproportion which the periodic times of satellites bear to their distance\nfrom their planet had been shown to be a consequence of it ; so that\nthe different facts imagined in Swift's narrative were all scientifically\nconsistent with one another.\nBut these facts involved a remarkable result, namely, that, on\naccount of the closeness of the satellites to Mars, the time they took\nto revolve round it was less than the time taken by it to rotate on\nits own axis,\u2014in other words, that the months were shorter than the\ns\n\f248 [part\nAlice Johnson.\ndays. This was a state of affairs that no scientific man would have\nbeen likely to predict, because there was, and still is, no known\nparallel to it.\nHowever, the imaginary conditions suggested in 1726 were to\nan important extent verified by the discovery of the two satellite\nof Mars by Professor Asaph Hall at the observatory of Washington,\nin 1877. The facts are given in the following quotation from Sir R.\nS. Ball's Story of the Heavens, p. 190 (Edition of 1893).\n\"The outer of the satellites revolves around the planet in the period of\n30 hours, 17 mins., 54 sees. ; it is the inner satellite which has commanded\nthe more special attention of every astronomer in the world. Mars turns\nround on his axis in a martial day, which is very nearly the same length as\nour day of 24 hours. The inner satellite of Mars moves round in 7 hours,\n39 mins., 14 sees. The inner satellite, in fact, revolves three times round\nMars in the same time that Mars can turn round once. This circumstance is\nunparalleled in the solar system ; indeed, as far as we know, it is unparalleled\nin the universe.\"\nThe diameter of Mars is 4,200 miles, and the period of his axial\nrotation is 24 hours, 37 mins., 22-7 sees. It may be convenient to\nshow the exact degree of correspondence between Swift's statement\nand the actual facts in a tabular form, assuming that he knew what\nthe diameter of Mars was.\nInner Satellite (Phobos)\nMean distance from centre\nAccording\nto Swift. As now kitow>i.\nof Mars 12,600 miles. 5,800 miles.\nPeriodic time 10 hrs. 7 hrs., 39 mins., 14 sees.\nOuter Satellite (Deimos)\nMean distance from centre\nof Mars 21,000 miles. 14,500 miles.\nPeriodic time 21 hrs., 30 mins. 30 hrs. 17 mins., 54 sees.\nIt will be seen that there is no very close resemblance between the\ntwo sets of figures. But the unique characteristic of the inner satellite\n\u2014that its periodic time is less than the period of rotation of its\nprimary\u2014is brought out in both. This would cause the satellite to\nappear to a dweller on Mars to rise in the west, instead of\u2014like all\nother heavenly bodies\u2014in the east. Swift's knowledge of astronomy\nwas probably sufficient to show him this anomalous result of the figures\nhe gives for his imaginary moon ; but as he does not state it explicitly,\nit is not quite certain that he realised it. It must be observed also\nthat, according to him, the outer satellite would have exhibited the\n\fXXXV.] 249\nCoincidences.\nsame anomalous feature, which, as a matter of fact, it does not.\nThe correspondence was, however, sufficiently striking to produce a\nstrong impression on the mind of at least one astronomer, as is shown\nin another passage which I quote from Sir R. S. Ball (op. cit. p. 192).\n'' A curious circumstance with respect to the satellites of Mars will be\nfamiliar to those who are acquainted with Gulliver's Travels. The\nastronomers on board the flying Island of Laputa had, according to Gulliver,\nkeen vision and good telescopes. The traveller says that they had found two\nsatellites to Mars, one of which revolved around him in ten hours. The author\nhas thus not only made a correct guess about the number of the satellites,\nbut he actually stated the periodic time with considerable accuracy ! We\ndo not know what can have suggested the latter guess. A few years ago any\nastronomer reading the voyage to Laputa would have said this was absurd.\nThere might be two satellites to Mars, no doubt ; but to say that one of\nthem revolves in ten hours would be to assert what no one could believe.\nYet the truth has been even stranger than the fiction.\"\nThe coincidence would, of course, have been more complete if it\nhad not been stranger, but only equally strange !\nCask 25.\nThe next case is a coincidence whose improbability enormously\nexceeds that of any other treated of in the present paper in which\na numerical calculation of chances is possible. I take the account\nof it from two sources, De Morgan's Budget of Paradoxes (p.\n168), and the chapter on \"Lotteries\" in R. A. Proctor's C\/tance and\nLuck (pp. 139-148), the facts having been originally recorded in a\nbook called Almanach Romain sur la Loterie Royale de France, ou lex\nstrennes ne'eessaires aux Aclionnaires et Receveurs de la dite Loterie, by\nM. Menut de St. Mesmin (Paris, 1830), which contains all the draw\nings of the French Lottery (two or three each month) from 1758 to\n1830. It was intended for those who thought they could predict the\nfuture drawings from the past, and various sets of \" sympathetic\nnumbers \" were given to help them. In the French Lottery, five\nnumbers out of ninety were drawn at a time. Any person in any\npart of the country might stake any sum upon any event he pleased,\nviz., that one or more of the numbers drawn would be a certain\nnumber or numbers, which was called a simple drawing ; or that a\n\u2022 certain number or numbers would be drawn in a certain order, which\nwas called a determinate drawing. If he won, he received a certain\nmultiple\u2014which, of course, increased with the improbability of\nsuccess\u2014of the value of his stake.\nDe Morgan remarks that \" the enormous number of those who\nplayed is proved to all who have studied chances arithmetically by\nthe number of simple quaternes [successes in four out of the five\ns 2\n\f250 Alice Johnson. . [part\nnumbers] which were gained : in 1822, fourteen; in 1823, six; in\n1824, sixteen; in 1825, nine, etc.\"\nThe case I refer to occurred in July, 1821, when one gambler\nselected the five numbers, 8, 13, 16, 46, and 64; and for the same\ndrawing another had selected the four numbers, 8, 16, 46, and 64.\nThe numbers actually drawn were, 8, 46, 16, 64, 13, so that both\ngamblers won. Their stakes were small, and their actual winnings were\nonly 131,350 francs and 20,852 francs respectively. \"The coincidence,\"\nobserves Proctor, \" was so remarkable (the antecedent probability\nagainst two gamblers winning on a simple drawing [a] simple\nqnine and a simple qualeme being about 22 billions to one) that one\ncan understand a suspicion arising that a hint had been given from\nsome one employed at the lottery-office. M. Menut insinuates this,\nand a recent occurrence at Naples suggests at least the possibility of\ncollusion between gamblers and the drawers of lottery numbers. But\nin the case above cited, the smallness of the stakes warrants the belief\nthat the result was purely accidental. Certainly the gamblers would\nhave staked more had they known what was to be the actual result of\nthe drawing. The larger winner seems to have staked two sous only,\nthe prize being, I suppose, 1,313,500 times the stake, instead of\n1,000,000, as on a similar venture in the Geneva lottery. Possibly\nthe stake was a foreign coin, and hence the actual value of the prize\nwas not a round number of francs. The smaller winner probably\nstaked five sous, or thereabouts, in foreign coin.\"\nSince lotteries and all kinds of sports with which betting is asso\nciated are events in which large numbers of persons are interested, we\nshould expect premonitory impressions about them\u2014other than mere\nguesses, like those in the case just given\u2014-to occur fairly often and\nto be occasionally fulfilled. But I have been surprised to find how\nrarely such premonitions seem to be recorded, even after the event.\nOne case, dating from 1857, was given in the Journal for March, 1890\n(Vol. IV., p. 226) and among all the records, printed and unprinted,\nof the Society, I think there are hardly a dozen of the same kind.\nThe following is a recent premonition of this kind, experienced by\nProfessor F. W. Haslam, of Canterbury College, Christchurch, New\nZealand, an Honorary Associate of the Society.\nCase 26.\nMrs. Haslam writes to Mr. Myers as follows :\u2014\nSt. Barbe, Riccarton, Christchurch, New Zealand,\nNovember 10th, 1897.\nDbak Mr. Mykrs,\u2014I do not know whether the following little circum\nstance will be at all interesting to you as, perhaps, an example of the working\nof the subliminal self. I send it on the chance.\n\fXXXV.] 251\nCoincidences.\nYesterday, being the Prince of Wales' birthday, was a holiday in the\nColony, and Frank meditated going to see the racing for the New Zealand\ncup. He has been so busy with exams, that he haH not had a moment\nto think about the horses, and was absolutely ignorant of their names,\nqualities, etc.\nBut as he lay between sleeping and waking he tried to imagine the\nwinner, and a jockey with all scarlet cap and jacket passed before his eyes,\npulling his horse in hard and finally arriving at the winning post. He\nthought \" scarlet is a common colour to see,,' but again the same jockey ^\npassed before his vision. He told Clarke, our Riccarton blacksmith, that\nmorning, and before the race was run he also told Dr. Nedwill of Oxford\nTerrace, and Dr. Moorhouse, in the hearing of other people, also of Christ-\nchurch. He then took me all about the saddling paddock before the race to\nsee what jockey was in all scarlet, and what sort of a horse he rode, and\nfinally he laid a little money on the race and won it. The horse was\n\"Waiuku,\" and was not the favourite, and all round us they were saying\nhe had not a chance ; but he seemed to become more popular towards the\napproach of the race, and was about second in the popular estimation. I\nwill ask Frank to read this and correct if necessary. \u2014Sincerely yours,\nRose St. Barbe Haslam.\nThe above is a correct statement of what happened.\nF. W. Haslam.\nMrs. Haslam adds:\u2014\nP.S. \u2014Waiuku's jockey did two or three times during the race sit back\nand pull the horse in hard. Just at the end he passed everything and won.\nIn reply to enquiries, Mrs. Haslam writes :\u2014\nSt. Barbe, Christchurch, Canterbury, N.Z., March 22nd, 1898.\nDear Sir,\u2014In answer to yours of January 1st, 1898, I am trying to get\na list of the horses that ran for the N.Z. Cup in November last, also state\nments from Dr. Nedwill and Dr. Moorhouse. As to newspaper accounts of\nthe prospects before the race, I am afraid that the points upon which\nMr. Haslam's word alone must be taken are these. He did not know before\nhe readied the course and bought a card of the races anything about the horses\nto run for the \"Cup,\" except \"St. Paul,\" a very well-known horse, who\nhe believed would win. He had no notion of the colours the jockeys wore,\nexcepting those of the local owner, Mr. Stead, whose jockeys always wear\nyellow. He did not dream of a Iwrse. He saw an all scarlet jockey riding\nto win, and on obtaining a card at the races his first thought was to look\nif there were an all scarlet jockey riding. As it turned out, there was, and\nhe rode ' ' Waiuku \" the second favourite\u2014the first being St. Paul. Waiuku\nwas a horse from the north island utterly unknown to him. He is not a\nrace goer, and has generally been busy at lectures during the most im\nportant race meetings at Christchurch. He had never seen the jockey\nbefore to his knowledge, or the colours, or the horse, and knows no jockeys\nby sight. After his vision of the jockey he thought to himself that scarlet\nmight be a usual colour for people to see with their eyes shut, so he tried\nagain to imagine the winner, and again saw the all scarlet jockey riding in\n\f252 Alice Johnson. [part\nto win, and he immediately apprised me of the fact. He cannot remember\nany similar experience, and I think that your magazine put the idea of\ntrying to see the winner into his head. ... I first asked Drs. Nedwill\nand Moorhouse to tell me if they recollected anything about Mr. Haslam'a\nvision. You see that Dr. Moorhouse says \"night,\" whereas it really was\nearly morning, but I expect he naturally concluded that.\nRose St. Bakbk Haslam.\nMrs. Haslam enclosed corroborative notes addressed to herself by\nthe two gentlemen mentioned in her letter, Dr. Nedwill and Dr.\nMoorhouse, as follows : \u2014\nChristchurch, New Zealand, February 21st, 1898.\nOn meeting my friend, Prof. Haslam, at the races at Riccarton in\nNovember last, he said to me, \"let us look at the card to see if there is a\njockey in all scarlet, as I dreamed a horse came in a winner in this race,\nwith these colours.\" Courtney Nedwill, M.D.\nChristchurch, March 20th, 1898.\nDeak Mrs. Haslam,\u2014My recollection of the N.Z. Cup day and Professor\nHaslam is as follows. But I might first mention that the reason I have for\nremembering the circumstances especially well are that for a good many race\nmeetings Professor Haslam and I have been in the habit of discussing the\nhorses and agreeing on the one we elected to bet on, and backing the horse\ntogether as a sort of partnership. On the Cup day I arrived at the course\nsomewhat late and did not at first see Professor Haslam, and had made my\nbets on the Cup before I found him ; but shortly before the race he came up\nto me and suggested that we should continue the partnership bets, at the same\ntime telling me that he had dreamt the previous night that he had seen the\nrace run and that a horse with scarlet colours had won. I turned up the race\ncard and saw that the only horse carrying scarlet colours was \" Waiuku.\" I\nsaid I was sorry that I had made all the bets I intended to on the race, so did\nnot join him in backing the horse. The Professor left me with the intention\nof backing \" Waiuku,\" but as 1 did not see him again for some time that day\nI don t remember whether he told me he had backed him, and I have had no\nconversation with him since on the subject. Of course you remember that\n\" Waiuku \" did win the race. In future if the Professor tells me he has had\nany more dreams about winners, I shall not fail to back them.\nB M. Moorhouse.\nMrs. Haslam sent us also a programme of the meeting, dated\nTuesday, November 9th, 1897. From this it appears that 14 horses\nwere entered for the New Zealand Cup, the third on the list being\nMr. S. McGuinness' \" Waiuku,\" colours \" All scarlet \" ; and that no\nother horse in the list had any scarlet in its colours.\nSome further cases of dreams about races, narrated by an\nAustralian member of the S.P.R., Mr. Donald Murray, will be found\nin Appendix III., p. 317.\n\fXXXv.] 253\nCoincidences.\nWe have another case, which I think hardly worth printing in full,\nof two dreams about the result of a boat race between the crews of\nColumbia College, Cornell University, and the University of Penn\nsylvania in June, 1895. (1) Dr. L. 0. Howard, Entomologist in the\nU. S. Department of Agriculture, dreamt the night before the race\nthat Columbia would win, which actually happened, and his statement,\nwritten in 1896, is confirmed by four persons to whom he had told the\ndream before its fulfilment. Professor Hyslop gives a careful analysis\nof the criticisms of the crews made in the New York papers beforehand,\nwhich were on the whole favourable to Columbia, though the betting\nwas in favour of the other two boats. Dr. Howard, who was living at\nWashington, expressly states that being, as a Cornell graduate, very\nmuch interested in the race, he had read all the newspaper accounts of\nthe condition of the crews, and on the day before his dream had been\nmade rather anxious on Cornell's account by a somewhat unfavourable\nreview in one of the New York papers. (2) Professor Hyslop\nhappened to mention this dream to one of his own students at\nColumbia College, who informed him that he also had dreamt on the\nsame occasion that Columbia had won, with other correct details of\nthe race. His account is confirmed by a friend of his, whom he had\ntold of the dream before its fulfilment. He, like Dr. Howard, was\nkeenly interested in the race.\nIn connection with these premonitory dreams of races, I may refer\nto a small group of much more impressive predictions of numbers to be\ndrawn in the conscription for the Belgian army ; the report of which\nwas sent in 1894 by Professor G. Hulin, of the University of Ghent,\nto Professor Sidgwick, and is given at length in Mr. Myers' paper on\n\"The Relation of Supernormal Phenomena to Time\" (Proceedings\nS.P.R., Vol. XI., p. 545). Five cases of the right numbers being pre\ndicted, during the eight years, 1886-1894, are given on good authority ;\nthe numbers in the first four cases being respectively 90, 112, 216, 111.\nThe first case was an especially striking one ; a clearly externalised\nvision of the number 90 appeared to the percipient, and produced a\nstrong impression on his mind, convincing him that he would draw that\nnumber. In the fifth case, the man who was to draw first announced\nthat his number would be 116, and on being told that that was already\ndrawn, said it would be 115, which turned out correct. The report\nonly professes to give correct predictions, and we have no means of\nknowing how often predictions of these numbers are made which\nturn out wrong. Neither are we told how many numbers there were\nto draw from, except in one case, where it appears that there were at\nleast 150, the lowest of them being 46 and the highest 223. In this\ncase, the number 216 was the one rightly guessed. We must assume,\n1 think, that these facts were known to the man who was to draw,\u2014\n\f254 [part\nAlice Johnson.\nthe narrative certainly does not exclude this supposition, and, in fact,\nrather suggests it,\u2014and, if so, the chance of his making a correct\nguess was, of course, about 1 in 150. The success of the prediction is\nthus much more noteworthy than in the dreams of the boat-race\nmentioned above, where the chance of guessing correctly was at least\n1 in 3. Still these conscription cases are hardly numerous enough\nto exclude the explanation of chance coincidence.\nDr. Ermacora in the article already referred to (see Annales (its\nSciences Psychiques, January-February, 1899, p. 46) suggests that the\nfulfilment of premonitions about the results of drawing by lot\u2014when\nthe drawing is done by the person who experiences the premonition\u2014\nmight be explained by telaesthesia, as we might suppose that in such\na case the drawing of the number is not accomplished blindly, but is\nguided by a supernormal perception which leads the subject to select\nautomatically,\u2014and probably unconsciously,\u2014the particular number.\nCase 27.\nThe next is a case of a premonition which I print because it is\nwell-authenticated, but the fulfilment of which hardly suggests more\nthan a chance coincidence, since it seems not unlikely that on occasions\nso momentous presentiments of the kind might occur.\nThe account was obtained for the Society by Lord Bute from\nLord Halifax, and is as follows : \u2014\nPowderham, April 8th, 1885.\nAccount of the attempted execution of John Lee for the murder of Miss\nKeyse, at Babbicombe, February, 1885, with letter to Lord Clinton enclosing\nstatement of prison warders as to his dream on the preceding night.\nCopied by me from account lent me by Lord Clinton, who was staying at\nPowderham when he received them.\n(Signed) Charles L. Wood.\nH.M. Prison, Exeter, April 8th, 1885.\nMy Lord,\u2014The following are the particulars of the dream of John Lee,\nwhich your lordship has requested me to supply.\nAfter the attempted execution of Lee on February 23rd, 1885, I went to\nhis cell, and spoke to him on the extraordinary event that had happened in\nhis case. He replied by saying that he had dreamed last night that it would\nso happen.\nAt my request he then related the nature of his dream.\nHe said he saw in his dream that he was led from his cell down through\nthe reception basement to the scaffold, which was just outside the door of\nthat basement.\nHe saw himself placed upon the scaffold, and efforts made to force the\ndrop, but it would not work. He then saw himself led away from the\nplace of execution, as it was decided that a new scaffold must be built before\nthe sentence of the law could be carried out.\n\fXXXv.] 255\nCoincidences.\nHe then told me that he had mentioned the dream to the two officers\nwho were in the cell with him, when he awoke at six o'clock in the morning.\nThe officers were not present when he told me this, nor had they been\nwith him since the attempt was made. But in the meantime the officers had\nreported the dream to the Governor of the prison, to whom also I had gone\nto make a similar statement.\nI ought to add, my lord, that John Lee did not attach any weight to the\ndream, but had fully believed up to the time of execution that he would be\nhanged, nor did he think of it while the attempts were being made. The\nforce of the dream came to him after the state of semi-consciousness, into\nwhich he had apparently relapsed during the attempts, had passed away.\u2014I\nam, your lordship's obedient servant,\n(Signed) John Pitkin, Chaplain.\nThe Right Hon. Lord Clinton.\n(Signed) A true copy, Clinton.\nFtbntary 23rd, 1885.\nA true account of a dream dreamed by John Lee on the night before the\nexecution.\nAt 6 a.m., when he arose from his bed, he said, \"Mr. Bennett, I have\ndreamed a very singular and strange dream. I thought the time was come,\nand I was led down through the reception out to the hanging place ; but\nwhen they placed me on the drop they could not hang me, for there was\nsomething wrong about the machinery attached to the drop, and then they\nled me off from the drop, and took me (instead of the way I came) around\nthe A Wing, and back through the A Ward to my cell.\"\nHe told me this in the presence of Mr. Milford, who watched with me\nthrough the night.\n(Signed) Samuel D. Bennett, Assistant Warder.\nJames Milford, Superior Officer.\n(Signed) A true copy. Clinton.\nThe letter from the Rev. John Pitkin, Chaplain to the Prison, enclosing a\ncopy of the statement of the warders, was written to Lord Clinton at his\nrequest when he was staying at Powderham in the beginning of April, 1885,\nhe being in the Chair at Quarter Sessions at the time.\nThe drop was contrived by two doors secured underneath by a bolt ; the\nprisoner was made to stand with a foot on each door and on the bolt being\nwithdrawn the doors would naturally fall apart.\nThe drop had been tried four [five.\u2014C.] times on the Saturday previous\nto the execution and had answered perfectly [twice in the presence of the\nexecutioner, who expressed himself satisfied with it.\u2014C.]. It was again tried\nafter the attempted execution, but without any weight on the scaffold, when\nit also succeeded.\nOn the occasion of the execution, at each successive attempt, the bolt\ncould not be withdrawn from the socket by hardly the eighth part of an inch.\nCase 28.\nThe following is a case of retrocognition, not precognition,\u2014 an\napparently supernormal perception of a past, not a future event,\u2014but it\n\f256 Alice Johnson.\nis convenient to class the two kinds of cases together, as is done in\nMr. Myers' article above referred to, and this one is accordingly\nplaced here. The percept takes the form of a communication from a\ndeceased person and there is, no doubt, some evidence for post-mortem\nknowledge of and interest in trifling circumstances like the one\ndescribed. But it will be seen that the case may easily be explained\nby telepathy.\nThe account was sent to us by Professor A. Alexander, of Rio\nJaneiro, who in a letter to Mr. Myers, dated July 21st, 1896, writes:\u2014\nTogether with this letter, I send you the evidence for a veridical border\nland hallucination. The people who sign the depositions are quite reliable\nand the facts no doubt occurred as they are stated. The case, however, does\nnot stand altogether outside the possibility of chance coincidence.\nProfessor Alexander sent us the original depositions signed by the\nwitnesses, with translations kindly furnished by himself. His own\nstatement is as follows :\u2014\nConstante Gardonne Ramos, the principal informant in the following\ncase, is employed as a foreman in the bookbinding department of the\n\" Benjamin Constant Institute for the Blind,\" one of the public establish\nments of Rio de Janeiro. He has himself been totally blind from his first\nyear, and he is therefore entirely destitute of visual memories. This will\naccount for the fact that the experience related by him was auditory and\ntactile, and not visual. From his description, it would appear to have been\na hallucination of the borderland type rather than a mere dream.\nI called on him for the first time on May 30th of this year, and then\ntook the notes from which his written declaration was drawn up. After the\ncorrection of some minor points, he agreed that the account was a faithful\nstatement of his memory of the occurrence, and requested his wife, Donna\nJulieta Ramos, to sign for him.\n17, Rua de Todosos Santos, Rio de Janeiro,\nJune 13th, 1896.\nOn the 17th of January of this year I went to the house of my mother,\nDonna Emilia Ramos, at No. 55, Rua Sao Joao Baptista. She was out, and\nwhile I stayed there, I talked to a parrot, which belongs to me, and which\nhas a value for us because of family associations. My father, who died on\nthe 4th of February, 1895, was, indeed, very fond of this bird.\nOn the following day in the very early morning, while I was yet lying in\nbed in that half conscious state of somnolence that precedes waking, I felt\ntwice the pressure of a hand placed on my body, and I then heard the familiar\ntones of my father's voice saying, \" Nenem, send for your parrot. I have\nalready given orders to deliver it up. It is in the house . . . and street\n. 1 with two doors closed on the side of the street.\" The voice sounded\nas if it were external and came from a person standing near me.\n1 In a later letter, Professor Alexander explains that neither the number of the\nhouse nor the name of the street was given in the message about the parrot ; the dote\nare intended to indicate their omission.\n\fXXXV.] 257\nCoincidences.\nNow, as above stated, I had been with the parrot on the preceding day\nand had observed nothing which might lead me to suppose that there was a\npossibility of its escaping. A very heavy rain was falling, and no one came\non the evening of that day to tell me what had happened.\nAbout 9 o'clock on the same morning of the 18th, as I was just finishing\nthe narration of my experience to my wife, the black woman came from\nthe other house to give us the news that my parrot had in fact escaped.

The first account which I received was from Mr. J. S., a brother\nof Mr. A. S., and was somewhat inaccurate, as you will see. I then\ncalled upon Mr. A. S. and after conversation with him wrote out an\naccount, at his request, in the name of his wife. When I presented the\nletter to him for signature, he told me that in talking over the subject with\nhis wife, he found that his statement was inaccurate in one detail. Mrs.\nX. was anxious to procure the services of a certain nurse for her\nconfinement and heard in the dream her father say to her mother \" You had\nbetter engage that German girl now, as she is not at work.\" He then walked\nto the wall and put his finger on the calendar. Mr. S. promised to\nrewrite the letter with this correction, but he has returned it to me as I wrote\nit, saying that it was otherwise accurate and the family preferred to sign it\nas it was.\n\fXXXV.] 25\u00bb\nCoincidences.\nI have seen Dr. T., who attended Mrs. X. He expressed great\ninterest in the case and signified his willingness to give me any information\nhe could about Mrs. X.'s condition. But he is an extremely busy man\nand lives at a great distance from me, and thus far I have been unable to\nhave more than a few minutes' talk with him. I will try again to see\nhim.-Yours respectfully, Marshall Wait.\nThe account enclosed, which is signed by Mrs. X.'s mother, her\nthree sisters, and Mr. A. S., her brother-in-law, is as follows : \u2014\nChicago, September 18th, 1896.\nDr. R. Hodoson,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014In March of this year, my sister, Mrs.\nX., was expecting her confinement. She was very apprehensive about\nthe result and expressed her belief that she was going to die. On\nMarch 5th she dreamed that she was in the kitchen of her house, but at the\nsame time could see her father (who has been dead eleven years) in the room\nabove, talking with her mother, but did not hear what he said. She saw\nhim hold in his hand a large printed calendar and put his finger on the\ndate of March 22nd. She told her dream the next morning anil inter\npreted it to mean that the baby would be born on that date The\naccouchement occurred, however, on March 12th. Much fun was poked at\nMrs. X. about the mistaken warning in her dream. Whether she put\nany other interpretation on it we do not know, as she never said anything\nto indicate that she did so. Her condition was in every way satisfactory\nto the attending physician until the afternoon of March 21st, when she\nsuddenly became unconscious and died on March 22nd, having never entirely\nregained her consciousness. The cause of her death was a throat trouble,\nnot connected with her confinement.\nMy husband, my sisters, and my mother, who were all familiar with\nthe facts and knew of the dream before the death, sign this with me\nin confirmation, but in case of publication we request you to withhold\nnames.\nNo memoranda were made of the dream, but the dates were fixed in our\nminds by the death occurring while our remembrance of them was fresh.\n(Signed)\nMr. Wait writes further :\u2014\nOctober 19th, 1896.\nI called this morning upon Mr. A. S. He requests me to say that\nMrs. X. told her dream the next morning to [her mother and two sisters],\nwho were all members of one household. Mr. and Mrs. S. heard of the\ndream later, but before the birth of the child. . . . The relations\nbetween the family and Mr. X., the widower, are strained, and I did\nnot ask for his signature. I enclose a certificate from the Health Office,\nwhich I thought would be the best independent evidence of the death and\nits date.\nThe certificate states that the Heath occurred, on March 22nd, 1896,\nof Mrs. X., aged 27 years ; \" cause of death, Tubercular Meningitis ;\nduration of disease, three days.\"\n\f2C0 [part\nAlice Johnson.\nAttempts to obtain further evidence from Mr. X. failed, but Mr.\nWait succeeded later in obtaining a statement of the case from the\nphysician in attendance, Dr. T. [assumed initial]. He writes :\u2014\nDecember 4th, 1897.\nAt last I am able to send you a statement by Dr. T. in the X. case. Dr.\nT. did not answer my appeal for a special appointment, so as a last resort I\nwrote out a statement from my memory of our conversation, and last\nevening I got him to sign it. I would have preferred to have him make out\nhis own statement, but as that seemed impossible, I did the next best thing.\nHe said that my statement was perfectly correct, and that I might have\nmade it even stronger\u2014that Mrs X.'s condition throughout her pregnancy\nand up to the moment when she complained of sudden severe pain in her\nhead was \" absolutely normal.\" Marshall Wait.\nChicago, December 3rd, 1897.\nI was the physician in attendance upon the late Mrs. X. at the time of\nher death. I was well acquainted with Mrs. X., having been a friend of the\nfamily as well as their physician for many years. She was of the tubercular\ndiathesis, but had had no trouble of the kind for some years. Her condition\nafter her accouchement was apparently satisfactory. I called upon her the\nmorning of the day before her death, \u2014more as a friendly matter than as a\nprofessional duty, \u2014and found her apparently in so good condition that I\njokingly told her that 1 would not have wasted my time if I had known how\nwell she was. I believe that in the processes of elimination and repair\nwhich follow child-birth, the glands in her throat became overtaxed and\ndischarged tuberculous matter into the base of the brain, causing the\nmeningitis which resulted in her death. But at the date of her dream (of\nwhich I was told before her death) there was no more reason why she should\nhave anticipated death than at any time for ten years before.\nIn case of publication I would prefer to have my name withheld.\n(Signed in full) M.D.\nIt is an obvious weakness in this case, as Mr. Wait remarked in\nsending it, that Mrs. X.'s condition at the time of her dream might\nhave predisposed her to presentiments of the kind. This does not,\nindeed, account for the exactness of the coincidence\u2014in the absence\nof which the case would, of course, be entirely worthless as evidence\nof anything supernormal \u2014but it adds considerably to the likelihood\nthat, if not the result of self-suggestion, it was merely due to chance.\nFurther instances of premonitions, the accounts of which would\nhave made this section too long, are to be found in Appendices II.,\nIII., and IV.\n\fXXXV.] 261\nCoincidences.\nCHAPTER IV.\nEXAMPLES OF COINCIdENCES WITH A STrONGEr ClAIM TO\nCAUSAl PrODUCTION.\nSection I.\nCoincidences apparently due to Subliminal Mental Action.\nCase 30.\nThe following case was recorded by the Rev. C. W. Bingham,\napparently within three weeks after it occurred, in Notes and Q,ieries\n(5th Series, Vol. XII., p. 256 ; September 27th, 1879). He writes :\u2014\nOn Sunday evening, Sept. 7th, as I was reading the 37th Psalm in\nchurch, my attention was suddenly drawn away, and there happened to me\nwhat I never remember to have happened to me before in the course of my\nlong ministry, viz., an utter inability to recover my lost place. After an\nawful pause, the clerk proceeded with the next verse, and a neighbour\nkindly directed me where to go on. On returning home, my wife pointed\nout the remarkable coincidence that the clause I had omitted was the latter\npart of verse 37 : \" His place cmdd nowhere be found ! \" 1\nC. W. Bingham.\nI should be inclined to apply to this case a suggestion made by\nMr. Myers in his discussion of what he calls promnesia,\u2014the feeling,\noften experienced by some persons, that what is going on at the\nmoment is a repetition of what has happened to them before, so\nthat they feel able to predict the next step. (See \" The Subliminal\nSelf. The Relation of Supernormal Phenomena to Time : Retro-\ncognition and Precognition,\" in the Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XI.,\npp. 341-344.)\nMr. Myers imagines that the subliminal perception of what is\ngoing on may sometimes be slightly in advance\u2014say, by a small\nfraction of a second\u2014 of the supraliminal perception. Then, when\nthe subliminal percept emerges into the supraliminal or ordinary\nconsciousness, there may be a sort of double consciousness of the\npercept\u2014or a consciousness, together with an apparent memory of the\nsame consciousness. The memory might appear to relate to a period\nsome time back, whereas it would really relate to a past only just past,\nThe effect would be that what is happening appears to the observer to\n1 The whole verse (in the Prayer-Book version) is :\u2014\" I went by, and lo, he was\ngone : I sought him, but his place could nowhere be found.\"\n\f262 [part\nAlice Johnson.\nbe a repetition of what has happened some time ago,\u2014the repetition\nbeing really in his own perception of the incidents, not in the incidents\nthemselves.\nAccording to this view, we may suppose that Mr. Bingham'i-\nsubliminal self was reading on a little ahead, and that the phrase,\n\" His place could nowhere be found,\" shot up into his supraliminal\nconsciousness a little too soon, namely, at the moment when it was\noccupied with the first part of the verse. This may have produced a\ndream-like confusion, in the midst of which, as in a dream, the phrase\nwas totally misapprehended and applied by the reader to himself,\ninstead of to \" the ungodly,\" to whom it really refers. Thus, it may\nactually have caused him to lose his place, and so \u2014possibly\u2014the\ncoincidence was produced.1\nIn further illustration of this view, I may refer to three cases given\nin Mr. Myers' paper just referred to (op. cit. pp. 411-415). In the\nfirst, Mr. Newnham, walking in a field, hears a voice telling him that\nhe will find a certain rare moth \u2014 Chaonia\u2014on a certain oak. Here,\nas Mr. Myers suggests, he may subconsciously have seen the moth\nsettle on the oak, and the fact may have been conveyed to his ordinary\nconsciousness in this hallucinatory form. In the second case, M.\nAdrien Guebhard, on a geological excursion, is suddenly reminded of a\nrare variety of fern with bifurcated fronds (in which he had once been\nmuch interested, but had never been able to find a specimen of it),\nand immediately afterwards sees a plant of the variety in question on\nthe ground close to him. The same experience with regard to this\nabnormality in ferns occurred to him twice more in the course of the\nsame year. We may suppose that on the two latter occasions he was\nsubconsciously on the look-out for further specimens, which might\notherwise have escaped his notice altogether. The third case was an\nexperience that occurred to Dr. Hodgson. Walking in a garden and\nengaged in a train of thought that made him oblivious to his surround\nings, he \" regained his consciousness of them suddenly to find himself\nbrought to a stand, in a stooping position, gazing intently at a five-\nleaved clover.\" Several years earlier he had been interested in getting\nextra-leaved clovers, but had not for years made any active search\nfor them.\nThe same superior alertness of the subliminal self seems to be\nshown in the familiar cases of dreams dramatised backwards, when\nthe dreamer first becomes consciously aware on waking of the noise or\nother stimulus which has apparently started the dream, and which,\ntherefore, must have been perceived earlier by his subliminal self.\n1 Even if his attention was drawn away by something external, such as a sudden\nnoise, it may have been a subliminal perception of the content of the verse that\nprevented him from finding his place again.\n\fXXXV.] 2G3\nCoincidences.\nThe following is an instance experienced by Dr. C. Theodore\nGreen, an Associate of the Society, who writes :\u2014\nBirkenhead, June 2Sth, 1896.\nWhile reading Mr. W. R. Newbold's \"Sub-conscious Reasoning,\"\nProceedings S.P.R., Part XXX., p. 19, I was reminded of a dream I had\nlast winter which may have been \"dramatised . . . from its apparent\nconclusion to its apparent initiation.\" I thought I was invited by some\nfriends to an Elizabethan mansion in the north of England, as they knew\nthat I was desirous of seeing a ghost. I was told that I should be sure to\nsee some, as they were as \"common as blackberries\" nearly every day in\nthat house, and that even the children and servants had got used to them.\nSo I went there in my dream, thinking that I should at last have something\nveridical for the S.P. R. So I wandered through the quaint galleries of the\nrambling old house, and slept in it for four nights without hearing or seeing\nanything in the least supernormal.\nBut during the fifth night\u2014I was to return home next day\u2014a ghost put\nits long white cold arm slowly up from under the bed and touched me on the\nright cheek. I instantly sprang up and seized the arm, feeling sure that I\nhad caught a ghost this time. Alas, I awoke, and found myself sitting half\nup, grasping the cold iron arm of the bedstead, which had evidently touched\nmy cheek as I rolled over in bed.\nI have since then been half awaked several times by touching this\nsame iron bar with hand or face, but have not had any dream connected\nwith it.\nAssuming that dreams may be \"dramatised backwards\" as well as\nforwards in point of time, it follows that the mental process involved was\nextremely rapid, for I must have awaked to ordinary consciousness within a\nvery few seconds of grasping that cold iron bar in midwinter.\n(Dr.) C. Theodore Green.\nCask 31.\nPerhaps few experiences are more familiar than to meet with a\nname or a fact in reading or conversation almost immediately after\nhearing of it, as we think, for the first time. This familiar experience\ngenerally strikes us, even though we are quite aware that the coin\ncidence is due to nothing more than selective attention to a point\nwhich\u2014for some reason\u2014interests us, and selective disregard of\nother points. The same explanation obviously applies to such cases\nas the three following, the first of which was sent to me by Dr.\nLeaf. He writes :\u2014\nBeechwood, Pembury Road, Tunbridge Wells, May 5th, 1898.\n[The following is] a sufficiently absurd coincidence which happened to\n.myself.\nWhen I was an undergraduate at Cambridge in 1871, I had an accident\nat a practice-wicket at cricket, by which two of my teeth were broken out.\nThis was on July 9. I had a good deal of pain , which gave me such a rest\nless night that I was glad, contrary to my usual habit, to get up early next\nT\n\f264 Alice Johnson. [part\nmorning and go to early chapel. In the Psalms for the morning (lviii., 6)\ncame the verse : \"Break their teeth, O God, in their mouths.\"\nWalter Leap.\nCase 32.\nThe other two cases were recorded by De Morgan in A Bridget of\nParadoxes (reprinted from the Athenatnm), 1872, pp. 280-282. Such\ncoincidences must, of course, be met with much more frequently by\nomnivorous readers like De Morgan than by persons of more limited\nintellectual interests.\nThe purely casual coincidence, from which there is no escape except the\nactual doctrine of special providences, carried down to a very low point of\nspecial intention, requires a junction of the things the like of each of which\nis always happening. I will give [two] instances which have occurred to\nmyself within the last few years ; I solemnly vouch for the literal truth of\nevery part of [both].\nIn August, 1861, M. Senarmont, of the French Institute, wrote to me to\nthe effect that Fresnel had sent to England, in or shortly after 1824, a paper\nfor translation and insertion in the European Reciew, which shortly after\nwards expired. The question was, what had become of that paper.\nI examined the Review at the Museum, found no trace of the paper, and\nwrote back to that effect at the Museum, adding that everything now\ndepended on ascertaining the name of the editor, and tracing his papers ; of\nthis I thought there was no chance. I posted this letter on my way home,\nat a post office in the Hampstead-road at the junction with Edward street,\non the opposite side of which is a bookstall. Lounging for a moment over\nthe exposed books, stent mens est mos, I saw, within a few minutes of the\nposting of the letter, a little catch-penny book of anecdotes of Macaulay,\nwhich I bought, and ran over for a minute. My eye was soon caught by\nthis sentence : \" One of the young fellows immediately wrote to the editor\n(Mr. Walker) of the European Review.\" I thus got the clue by which 1\nascertained that there was no chance of recovering Fresnel's paper. Of the\nmention of current reviews, not one in a thousand names the editor.\nIn the summer of 1865, I made my first acquaintance with the tales of\nNathaniel Hawthorne, and the first I read was about the siege of Boston in\nthe War of Independence. I could not make it out : everybody seemed to\nhave got into somebody else's place. I was beginning the second tale when a\nparcel arrived ; it was a lot of old pamphlets and other rubbish, as he called\nit, sent by a friend who had lately sold his books, had not thought it worth\nwhile to send these things for sale, but thought I might like to look at them\nand possibly keep some. The first thing I looked at was a sheet which, being\nopened, displayed \"A plan of Boston and its environs, showing the true\nsituation of his Majesty's army and also that of the rebels, drawn by an\nengineer, at Boston, Oct., 1775.\" Such detailed plans of current sieges being\nthen uncommon, it is explained that \"the principal part of this plan was sur\nveyed by Richard Williams, Lieutenant at Boston ; and sent over by the son\nof a nobleman to his father in town, by whose permission it was published.\"\nI immediately saw that my confusion arose from my supposing that the\nking's troops were besieging the rebels, when it was just the other way.\n\fXXXV.] 265\nCoincidences.\nAnother instance of a coincidence produced in great part by\nselective attention to a subject in which the narrator was specially\ninterested is the following.\nCase 33.\nThe account of this case was sent to Mr. Myers on the day of\nits occurrence by Mr. Edward D. Blyth, of 12, Belgrave Crescent,\nEdinburgh. The account was written by Mrs. Blyth, and corrobora\ntive notes by her daughter, Mrs. Henry Anderson, and Mr. Blyth\nare appended.\n12, Belgrave Crescent, Edinburgh, January 5th, 1893, 8.55 p.m.\nI am at present engaged in tracing the pedigree of an old Irish family of\nwhich I am a scion. I expressed a wish to my daughter, Mrs. Henry\nAnderson, that I could find a book which would give me a full account of the\nIrish Brigade (time of James II.), two members of which, Colonel Shee\nand Count D'Alton Shee, were my kinsmen. I expressed this wish several\ntimes. Later in the day, accompanied by Mrs. H. A., I went for the first\ntime to the Advocates' Library in the Parliament House in the High-street\nof Edinburgh. Not knowing the way, by mistake we entered a room\nreserved for members only. Finding we were in the wrong place, Mrs. H. A.\nsaid, \"Wait here, mamma, while I go and find out where we ought to go,\"\nand left me standing in the middle of the large room, surrounded by thousands\nof books. I crossed the room with no particular end in view, and stopped\nin front of a division filled with books, and the very title my eyes fell upon\nwas the Army List of the Irish Regiments of King James II., in two volumes,\ncavalry and infantry, by J. Daltim, published in Dublin, in 1860. I have\nnot yet recovered from the curious shock I then received and am immensely\nimpressed. I told my husband of the curious incident when I saw him after\nreturning home. Kate m Blyth\nMrs. Henry Anderson writes :\u2014\nJanuary 5th, 1893, 9.25 p.m.\nI can testify to the above occurrence. In the morning my mother\nrepeatedly expressed the wish to obtain a book on the subject of the Irish\nBrigade, in order to find some kinsmen's names. I left her, as stated, in the\nlarge private room, and coming back after an absence of four or five\nminutes, met her coming out through the swing doors with such an agitated\nexpression that I thought she must have had a start of some kind. She\nsaid immediately, \"Kate, such a very extraordinary thing happened just\nnow. I went towards one of the divisions of books, and the first title my\neyes fell on was ,\" and she gave the name of the book. She was\nquite startled and nervous all the afternoon and evening.\nKate Henry Anderson.\nMr. Blyth adds :\u2014\nJanuary 5th, 1893, 9.40 p.m.\nThe above accounts are in perfect harmony with what my wife and\ndaughter related to me some hours ago.\nEdward D. Blyth.\nt 2\n\f266 [part\nAlice Johnson.\nThis case is clearly not an accidental coincidence. It must, indeed,\nhave been merely by chance that the particular part of the book-case\nMrs. Blyth first approached happened to contain a book with the\ninformation she wished for ; that is, it was not her wish that caused\nthe book to be in that part of the room, or, indeed, in the room at all.\nBut given that there was such a book in that part, it was not chance\nthat led her at once to pick it out, but hgr interest in the subject,\nmaking her on the alert for anything relating to it.\nCase 34.\nThe following case is extracted and somewhat abridged from an\narticle on \" Psychical Research and Coincidences,\" by Professor J. H.\nHyslop, in The Psychological Revieiv for July, 1898. It relates to\nsome of the experiences of Mrs. D., a lady with whom Professor\nHyslop has been long acquainted (an earlier report of her crystal\nvisions was given by him in the Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XII., p. 259).\nThe central incident in the present account is a premonition of Mrs.\nD.'s of the death of one of her children. The case therefore properly\nbelongs to the preceding section, but I place it here on account of the\nvery careful and complete analysis of all the evidence for its possibly\nsubliminal causation given by Professor Hyslop, which\u2014for want of\nspace\u2014I do not reprint in full, but for which I may refer the reader\nto his original article.\nSome time in July, 1897, Mrs. D. had a strong impression that some\nunusual \" burden \" was going to fall upon the family. She could describe\nthe feeling in no other way, and it will be noticed that the expression is a\ncommon one with religious minds, which often employ the term to denote \u00bb\nprovidential affliction. This meaning Mrs. D. gave to the term herself.\nBut the feeling was too vague to identify with any past cause or any incident\nto be forecasted in the future. Mrs. D. was in good health ; there was\nnothing in her physical condition that would suggest a clear physical cause\nof such a feeling. I am not implying that there were no such causes, for\nthere may have been conditions that a skilled physician would detect. But\nto the consciousness of the subject there was no indication of indisposition\nof any kind. In fact, she has answered all my inquiries on this point to the\neffect that her peculiar experiences always occur most frequently when her\nhealth is at its best, so far as her own judgment can determine. Throughout\nthe whole period over which the present narrative extends her health was\ngood. In the month of August this premonitory feeling repeated itself very\nfrequently, and became so annoying that Mrs. D. mentioned it to her\nhusband, who confirms her statement in regard to both facts, and hence\nsupports the supposition that the location of the experience previous to its\nreal or supposed fulfilment is not due to an illusion of memory. Finally,\nthe feeling became so intense and persistent that Mrs. D., as is often the\ncase with religious minds as deeply imbued with piety as is her own,\nsought relief in prayer. But though this resource had in her estimation\n\fXXXV.] 207\nCoincidences.\nbeen effective in other cases where it had been instigated, as might well\nbe in a mind so sensitive to automatisms as is her own, yet the feeling\ncould not be dismissed.\nTo make the matter clearer it is necessary to anticipate the sequel of the\nstory, to which the incidents of the narrative are supposed to refer. This\nis that the little daughter, whom I shall call Lettie, and who was just one\nyear and nine months old, died on December 2nd, 1897, from the burning of\nits cradle.\nAt odd times between August and December Mrs. D., in her thoughts\nabout the child's future and while planning some little thing for her, would\nhear a voice saying, \"She'll never need it.\" One of these occasions was\nthe following : The family live in a house with few accommodations for a\nclergyman who requires a study, and Mrs. D. planned to give Lettie a\ncertain room for a bedroom when she grew older, and was running over how\nshe would furnish it, and this voice came as described. It was not exactly\nwhat one could describe as an external voice, nor, again, a mere thought\nimpression or product of the memory and imagination, as we usually\ncharacterise such things, but one of those internal voices with which\npsychical researchers have become familiar and which Mrs. D. herself dis\ntinguishes as neither a real voice nor a memory reproduction, but an\nimpression with all the characters of a real voice except the sense of\nexternal reality.\nThere were many repetitions of this voice in about the same language.\nOne of them occurred about two weeks before the child's death. Mrs. D.\nhad resolved to write a little diary which she could give to the child when\nit became older. She wrote down two separate accounts on different days\nof certain events having an interest to the little girl. But, while writing\nthem, this voice came as before : \" She'll never need them.\" The day before\nthe child died the same voice appeared, and on the morning of its death the\nchild was running about the house in a rather dilapidated pair of shoes,\nwhen Mrs. D. remarked to the child that her feet must be cold and thought\nshe must have a new pair of shoes. In the midst of her thoughts came the\nvoice again, \" She'll never need them.\" It must be added also that, pre\nvious to the impression of a coming \"burden\" above described, this voice\nhad been heard several times.\nAbout a week before the child's death Mrs. D. thought she smelled fire\nat night, and feeling afraid of it went to the cellar to look after the matches\nand to see that there was no danger. She found no traces of fire and\nnothing to explain her impression. But from that time she began to be\ncareful about matches, seeing that they were in safe places and out of reach.\nShe even went so far as to look over the house for the matches, and felt a\nstrong impulse to burn all parlour matches which were of that kind that is\neasily lighted. Once the impulse to do this was attended with something\nlike a voice warning her to the same end, and about the danger of fire.\nNothing definite enough having been suggested by the voice to guide her\nactions directly, Mrs. D. could only imagine the necessary precautions, and\nfinally thought to hang a dripping pan in front of the range fire, a thing\nMrs. D. had never done before, to prevent coals from falling out during the\nnight. Nor had any apprehensions of this kind ever been felt before, within\n\f268 [past\nAlice Johnson.\nher recollection, and there were no special reasons to suppose that any\ndanger of fire in this way existed.\nOn the morning of the child's death, and during family worship, another\nincident of some interest occurred. In the midst of the petition for\nindividual members of the family, when she came to the phrase with which\nshe besought divine care for each one, and attempted to apply it in behalf\nof Lettie, though no difficulty was encountered in the case of the other\nchildren, in this case something seemed to stop Mrs. D.'s voice, and she\ncould not repeat the usual language. She recalls no similar previous\nexperience.\nOn the same morning, about an hour before the fatal disaster, the pro\npulsion to destroy the matches that were dangerous became stronger and\nstronger, until Mrs. D. turned and reached for the box to destroy it. But\nas she picked it up she thought, No ; L. (the elder boy) is gone, aud she\nthought that she might need the matches to light the gas stove. She then\nsaid aloud to herself, \" I'll destroy it as soon as he comes back.\" She then\nwent on with her work in the kitchen. When the time came, about ten\no'clock, Lettie was taken up to her crib for the morning sleep, and as Mrs.\nD. was putting her into the cradle a voice, such as has been described above,\nsaid: \" Turn the mattress.\" This Mrs. D. was accustomed to do, though\nshe had never experienced any voice before in connection with it. But,\nbeing in a great hurry, she simply said in a motherly way to the child that\nshe would turn the mattress after the child had taken her nap. She then\nwent downstairs to her work. After a while she heard the child cry, and\nhurrying up to the room, found the crib and its bedding on fire, and the\nchild so badly burned that it died in three hours.\nThe only possible way to account for the accident was to suppose that\nthe child had found a match, possibly in the crib or on the mantelpiece,\nwhich she could reach, and, lighting it, had set its bedclothes on lire.\nThe other two children were not present. L. had gone down town on an\nerrand and E., the younger boy, was at school. No fire was on this floor\nof the house, hut in the kitchen and the dining-room, both below.\nNow, another incident of much interest had occurred many times\nduring the two or three years' residence of the family in this house. Mrs.\nD. had often had a visual apparition of this very crib on fire, but, as\nher apparitions or visual automatisms are very frequent, she had not\nthought to assign it any meaning or possible coincidental value until after\nthe accident.\nThese were the experiences of Mrs. D. previous to the event, but\nthere were two other incidents by other persons than Mrs. D., that lend\nthemselves to a construction of coincidence in connection with the accident.\nThe first is exactly like the one narrated as occurring at family devotions.\nMrs. D. has a sister living in Connecticut, some seventy-five miles from B.,\nthe home of Mrs. D. No correspondence has passed recently between them,\nand the sister was not given to as devotional a life as Mrs. D. It must also\nbe remembered that the sister had ridiculed Mrs. D.'s stories of her\nexperiences, and even went so far as to half jestingly criticise Mrs. D. for\nher extravagant piety. She discouraged Mrs. D.'s tolerance of possible\nsignificance in many of the coincidences which I have recorded in the\n\fXXXV.] 269\nCoincidences,\nProceedings of the Society for Psychical Research (Vol. XII., p. 259 seq.),\nwhen they were the subject of conversation. But on hearing of the child's\ndeath she came to B. and narrated an experience of her own. It was to the\neffect that about a week before the death of the child she had had such an\nexperience as she had never had before. An overwhelming impression of\nsome great calamity to occur in the \" family \" (the incidents show that the\nterm included the whole family connections), and the impulse arose in her\nto pray for each one, which she did, feeling, as she expressed it in her\nnarrative, that this was an unusual procedure for her. She went over each\nperson among parents and relatives, until she came to the child, Lettie,\nwhen her voice suddenly stopped and she could not pray for her as for the\nothers. She finally managed, however, to utter with struggling voice a\npetition for \" our little blossom,\" the name which she was accustomed to\napply to Lettie when speaking of her.\nThe second incident was an experience of the next door neighbour to\nthe D.'s. I shall call the lady who had it Mrs. G. On the afternoon of the\nchild's death Mrs. G. came in about three o'clock and, a propos of the\naccident, remarked that on the night before, I believe it was, she had been\nwakened by the fear of fire and had gone down to the cellar to search for it,\nand exclaimed while making the search : \" Oh ! if our little baby would\nburn up ! \" Her own child was about the age of Lettie. I ascertained the\nfacts of Mrs. G.'s experiences from her own statements, and found that\nthey were exactly as told me by Mrs. D.\nThe night after the burial of the child Mrs. D. could picture to herself\nnothing but the little coffin and the grave. To remove the unpleasant feeling\nMrs. D. prayed to have a realising sense and the power to know that the\nchild was a spirit and did not lie in the grave. At this time she was at the\nhome of her sister, whither the family had gone to seek a burial place. One\nmorning, soon after this prayer, she awakened and lay for an hour thinking\nover family affairs. The sun was shining brightly in the room, and while\nthinking, suddenly she saw a form by the bedside, and, turning, saw an\napparition of little Lettie with her hands on the bedside and smiling at Mrs.\nD. By her side was the form of a woman, holding her hands about the\nchild, as if to assist it. Mrs. D. sprang up in bed and unconsciously\nexclaimed, \"Good morning, Lettie,\" and both figures immediately vanished.\nThe forms were transparent and objects could be seen through them. The\ngrown form was not recognisable as any one that Mrs. D. knew. Mrs. D.\nretained a strong sense of satisfaction from the vision. She is disposed to\ninterpret it as a providential comfort for her sorrow.\nAt the end of December another incident took place that will have some\ninterest. This time it was the experience of the little boy E. It was first\ntold me by Mr. D. The following letter from Mrs. D. narrates the details\nof the occurrence :\u2014\n\" January 5th, 1898.\n\"You requested a note of E.'s recent experience. It occurred on\nThursday eve, December 30th (1897).\n\"I lay down on the sofa to rest in the evening, and, as he often does, he\nclimbed back of me to rest with me. I do not remember what my thoughts\nwere, but feel quite confident I was not thinking of my experience at\n\f270 [part\nAlice Johnson.\nS , Conn., when E. said : 'Mamma, is little Lettie air now? Is she\nlike smoke ? ' Why, darling ? ' 'Cause I just saw her and put my anas\naround her and she was like air.' I will endeavour to keep account of any\nthing further. jj n\nOn inquiry about the incident I could find no trace of any story to the\nchild that might lead to a belief on its part in such a reality as its experience\nmight be taken to describe. The child was only four years old. The\nincident impressed both parents as very striking, and they were eviJeutly\npuzzled by it, having a strong aversion to the apparent meaning of such\noccurrences.\nThe apparition of the burning cradle is one of the most striking coin\ncidental features of the whole narrative. The fact is that the crib stood\nwithin a few feet of a fire grate. But as there had been no fire in this\ngrate for a year or more the accident could not have been caused by this.\nMrs. D. herself had all along explained the vision of the burning crib by\nthis very proximity to the fire grate. Almost every one would have such\na possibility suggested to the mind by this situation of the crib. But nut.\nevery one ia subject to automatisms, and such thoughts are easily referred\nto their proper source in association. Mrs. D., however, as we have found,\nis liable to these occurrences. Now it is the unusual occurrence anil\ncharacter of automatisms that call special attention to them. They are\neasily remembered as interesting and significant if any coincidence with\nthem is remarked. If the accident of the child's death had occurred only\nin connection with an association of a burning crib, every one would have\ndismissed it as a coincidence not worth taking seriously, and no significance\nwould be given it. But when an accident of this sort occurs in coincidence\nwith an apparition apparently premonitory in character, we forget associa\ntion and are tempted by the unusual nature of the phenomenon to ascribe\nit a value that it may not deserve. We may concede that such an\nexperience might have some significance if not connected with automatisms\nas frequent or habitual occurrences. But here we have in this very subject\nthe existence of automatisms which can be traced directly to emotional\ninfluences of various sorts. There is a frequent connection between pas;\nthoughts and associations and certain sensory automatisms, and we have\nonly to suppose this case one of them in order to explain it in a natural way.\nSection II.\nCoincidences possibly or probably due to Telepathy.\nAmong all those apparently supernormal faculties which form the\nsubject of the investigations of the Society for Psychical Research,\nTelepathy is probably the one whose existence most persons interested\nin psychical research regard as the most firmly established. I there\nfore place in my last section coincidences suggestive of Telepathy.\nI cannot claim that the cases given here add in any at all material\n\fXXXV.] 271\nCoincidences.\ndegree to the evidence for telepathy already published, and several of\nmy most evidential ones have already been printed in the Journal.\nNo one denies that merely accidental coincidences between the thoughts-\nand expressions of two different persons often occur, and we cannot,\nof course, treat any coincidences as telepathic unless we have strong\nreason for thinking that they are not accidental. But since, as\nalready observed, we have no means at present of discovering for\ncertain whether telepathy has operated or not in any individual case,\nbecause of our ignorance of its method of operation, the main object\nof this section is to illustrate the difficulty of drawing the line between\naccidental and telepathic coincidences For this purpose I arrange\nmy cases in a sort of rough order of merit, beginning with those that\nseem to me evidentially weakest and ending with the stronger ones.\nThe weakness of the first case consists in the absence of any\nsort of connection between the persons whose thoughts coincided.\nCase 35.\nThis case, which was recorded a few days after it occurred,\nwas sent to Mr. Myers by Mr. L. C. Powles, an Associate of the\nSociety. He writes:\u2014\n9, Queen's Gate Place, London, S.W., March 1st, 1898.\nDear Sir,\u2014I hardly know whether the dream given on the other side of\nthis is worth sending you. I should be more inclined to set it down as a\nmere coincidence if it were not that I am somewhat easily impressed by the\nthoughts of others. I ought to add Mrs. Wellesley is known to me.\u2014\nYours truly, L Q powlE8\nMarch 1st, 1898.\nOn the night of the 26th ult. I had a vivid dream to this effect ; that I\nhad determined to commit suicide and had made arrangements to do so, even\nto the extent of ordering my coffin of the village carpenter ; but I was\nprofoundly disinclined to carry out these arrangements when the time had\ncome and confided to a friend that I should put off the deed till Thursday nest.\nMy friend in the dream replied grudgingly, \"Well, I suppose it can be\nmanaged.\" This dream, which I attributed to a reminiscence of a book I\nhad been reading the day before, Tim Early Life of Wordsworth, I related\nto Lady Eden and Mr. Wellesley on the 27th.\n[These persons add]\nWe certify this I , ^lIiE1^\"\nI Victor vv ellesley.\nOn the 28th came a letter from the Hon. Mrs. Wellesley to Mr.\nWellesley, dated 26th February, Wiesbaden, of which I send you part.\nThe coincidence is very curious.\n\f272 [pakt\nAlice Johnson.\nThe passage in the letter in which the coincidence occurs is as\nfollows :\u2014\nHoman's establishment is in a great state of excitement and scared,\nas a chap there contemplates committing suicide and goes about with a\nrevolver. He has tww put it off till next Thursday.\nCase 36.\nThe following is a coincidence whose triviality throws doubt on\nits telepathic character. It was obtained by Professor Harlow S. Gale,\nof the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, from Mrs. Charles T.\nJerome, who writes to Professor Gale :\u2014\nMinneapolis, February 20t.h, 1896.\n. . . On the afternoon of October 29th, 1895, at ten minutes past\nfour, I stepped upon a chest in my closet to reach my muff which was lying\non a high shelf. As I turned, my muff brushed across the top of the door\ncasing, and a key fell to the floor. I picked it up and recognised it as the\nkey to a cash box belonging to my son, Albert C. Jerome, which he had\nsupposedly lost about a year previous.\nWhen he returned home in the evening I said, \" Albert, I found the key\nto your cash box to-day.\" \" Did you 1 \" he replied, \" I was thinking about\nthat key like everything this afternoon.\" \" Have you thought of it\nfrequently?\" I asked. \"No,\" he replied, \"I haven't thought of it before\nin six months that I remember. I had given up finding it.\"\nI inquired at what time he was thinking of it, to which he answered,\n\" A little after four o'clock, about ten minutes after. I know the time\nbecause I was thinking about it just as I reached the Great Western freight\ndepot, and looked at the clock as I entered, not with reference to that, but\non account of my errand there I took note of the time.\" I had not then\nmentioned at what time I found the key.\nI had also noted the time, simply because I was just then going out to\ndrive, and taking my muff down passed immediately out.\nIncidents of a similar nature have several times occurred between Albert\nand myself, but I have never regarded them of sufficient importance to\ninterest any one but ourselves. . .\nMrs. Chas. T. Jerome.\nAs far as I am concerned this is O.K.\nAlbert C. Jerome.\nOn the afternoon of October 29th, 1895, very shortly before ten minutes\npast four, Mrs. Charles T. Jerome was standing on a chair-seat before an\nopen chamber door. To keep her balance she put forth her hand, laying\nher fingers upon the ledge above the doorway, and at the same time, by\nmerest accident, upon the key of her son Albert's cash box\u2014the key having,\nno doubt, been laid there t > hide it ; but the place and circumstance of its\nhiding had been quite forgotten. Indeed, it had been missing for about a\nyear, and its loss had been nearly dropped from memory.\nUpon her son's return she told him of her finding his lost key. He\nasked when it was found ; and learning that, exclaimed in surprise that at\n\fXXXV.] 273\nCoincidences.\njust about that time he had been thinking very intensely of the key, and\nsaid furthermore that he did not remember having thought of the key before\nin six months.\nI knew the time when the key was found, because it was just before\ngoing to drive with my mother, and at starting looked at the clock.\nAlbert knew approximately the time when he was thinking of the key,\nbocause he was on his way from McMillan and Co. 's warehouse (cor. 2 St.\nand 1 Ave. N.) to the Chicago Great Western freight depot (cor. 10 Aves.\nand Wash.), and noted the hour and minute of leaving for the depot.\nCharles W. Jerome.\nThe next case, again, may possibly have been telepathic, though\nthere is no proof that Miss M. was thinking of her friends just at the\ntime when they began to talk about her. The coincidence seems to\nrelate to the place rather than the time of the conversation.\nCase 37. [L. 1099.]\nThe account was received from one of our Associates who wishes\nthat the names and address should not be given.\nCheltenham, December 11th, 1897.\n. . My wife was walking with her married daughter in Cheltenham\nto-day, December 11th, and when they arrived at Montpellier Walk, about\nTthe centre of the town, my wife remarked to her daughter that she would\nlike to receive some information about a lady whom she had met several\nyears ago at her daughter's bungalow in Ceylon. They continued talking of\nthis lady for some minutes, and were much surprised to find on their return\nhome that the lady in question had called only half-an-hour previously, and\nexpressed great regret at not finding them at home, as she had to leave\nCheltenham by the next train. The coincidence is rendered the more\nremarkable by the fact that my son-in-law had met the lady, at the exact\nspot in the town where, about half-an-hour afterwards, my wife had the\nimpression that she would like to receive some news about her. I may add\nthat the lady does not live at, or near, Cheltenham, and beyond knowing\nithat she had left Ceylon, and was residing in England, neither my wife nor\n\u2022daughter knew where she was living, or had the remotest idea that she was\nin Cheltenham, and would call upon them.\n(Signed) [Mr. A.]\nIn reply to inquiries we received the three following letters :\u2014\nCheltenham, December 17th, 1897.\nDear Sir,\u2014On the morning of the 11th inst. I met Miss M. on Mont\npellier Walk. She had been to call on my wife, and, failing to find her at\nhome, was walking down town in hopes of meeting her. I turned and\nwalked with Miss M. for some time, looking for my wife until it was time to\nreturn to where she was staying, as she had to catch the train to Malvern.\nAt lunch my mother-in-law remarked to my wife that it was a curious\n\u2022coincidence they should have been talking of Miss M. on their way home. I\n\f274 [pai.t\nAlice Johnson.\nasked if they remembered whereabouts they began speaking of her, and it\nturned out that it was on the exact spot to a yard where I had met Miss M.\n-Yours faithfully, (signed) [Mr r]\nDecember 17th, 1897.\nDear Sir,\u2014I was walking home from town, and when at the Montpellier\nWalk I said to my daughter (Mrs. \" B.\") that I wondered if had arrived\nfrom Ceylon and where she would pass the winter. We continued talking\nabout her almost the whole way home. At the Christ Church crossing we\nmet my son-in-law (Mr. \"B.\") on his bike and he called out something\nabout which we did not understand. On reaching home we found a-\nletter from this lady saying how vexed she was to miss us, as she was leaving\nby next train. At lunch my son-in-law remarked how curious we should\nhave talked of during the morning, and asked where we were when the\nconversation began. We said, \"At the Montpellier Walk,\" which proved\nto be exactly where he had met about half-an-hour before we returned\nthat Wfty- (Signed) [Mrs. A.]\nDecember 17th, 1897.\nDear Sir,\u2014I was walking home with my mother when she asked me if\nI had had any news of Miss M. and where she was, and wondered where she\nwas going to live. We began talking of her on the Montpellier Walk, and\ncontinued chatting about her nearly the entire way home. At the Christ\nChurch crossing we met my husband on his bike, who shouted out something\nabout Miss M., which we failed to understand. But when we arrived at the\nhouse we found that Miss M. had called and was so sorry to miss us, as she\nwas leaving Cheltenham by the next train. At luncheon we were telling my\nfather and husband how curious it was that we were talking of Miss M. s>i\nmuch and that she should be in Cheltenham, and my husband asked us where\nwe began to speak of her, and we told him at the Montpellier Walk, which\nproved to be exactly where he had met our friend before we returned\nthat way.\n(Signed) [Mrs. B.]\nCase 38.\nIn the following the detailed nature of the agreement suggests more\nstrongly, though still by no means conclusively, that the coincidence was\ndue to telepathy. I received it from Mr. A. Berry, Fellow and Lecturer\nin Mathematics of King's College, Cambridge, who writes to me :\u2014\nFairseat, Wrotham, April 3rd, 1898.\nDear Miss Johnson, \u2014The circumstances relating to the coincidence of\nwhich 1 was speaking are as nearly as I can recollect as follows :\u2014\nI was taking part in an Intercollegiate Examination in Mathematics in\n1890. In addition to papers on specific subjects, there is also a paper of\nproblems, which may be chosen from any of the subjects of examination.\nThe other papers contain \" bookwork \" questions and problems, or \" riders,\"\nconnected with them. Shortly before the examination it appeared that Mr.\nA. Larmor, of Clare, and I proposed to set closely similar problems\u2014one in\nthe \" problem paper \" and one in the paper on a specific subject, Statics.\n\fXXXV.] 275\nCoincidences.\nI find that Mr. Larmor's version was actually printed and set in the\nStatics paper. I infer that I was setting mine in the problem paper, but I\nhave no independent recollection of this. The problem paper is made up by\ncontributions from each of four Colleges which join in the examination ; it is\nedited by one examiner and circulated in proof to all. I imagine that Mr.\nLarmor saw my question in proof and then noticed that it was substantially\nhis own. My question was then withdrawn.\nI was not able to find the question among the old examination papers\nwhich I possessed, but satisfied myself by a process of exclusion that the\nyear must have been 1890, and after leaving Cambridge asked Mr. Richmond,\ngiving him this date, to send me a copy of the question (Mr. Larmor's\nversion), which I enclose.\nI have no copy of my own version, but my recollection is that the data\nof the problem\u2014as contained in the first sentence\u2014were identical, but that\nI only asked for a certain result which expressed the stresses (tensions) along\nthe four strings, whereas Mr. Larmor asked also for the stresses along the\nrods, and expressed the whole result in a singularly elegant form, which I had\nmissed. I do not think that the result asked for is nearly as characteristic\nof a problem of this class as the data, so that the resemblance between our\ntwo versions is greater than might perhaps at first sight appear.\nA new text-book on Statics (by J. Greaves of Christ's) had recently come\nout, and it is possible that something in that may have suggested the problem\nto both of us, but I have no recollection of anything of the sort.\nI have written to Mr. Larmor for his recollection and enclose a copy of the\nletter, so that you may be able to judge how far his reply is suggested by my\nletter. When 1 hear from him I will send the letter on. \u2014Yours sincerely,\nArthur Berry.\nThe copy of the question as finally printed, furnished by Mr.\nRichmond to Mr. Berry, was as follows :\u2014\nA parallelepiped formed of twelve weightless rods freely jointed together\nat their extremities, is in equilibrium under the action of four stretched\nelastic strings, connecting the four pairs of opposite vertices. Show that the\nfigure is its own stress-diagram.\nThe following is Mr. Berry's letter to Mr. Larmor, asking for his\nrecollection of the incident :\u2014\nApril 3rd, 1898.\nDear Larmor, \u2014Do you happen to remember any details of the circum\nstances under which we both set, or wanted to set, a problem about a\nparallelepiped in the Mays, about 1890 ? A friend of mine is interested in\ncoincidences, and has asked me to get, if possible, your statement of the\nmatter as well as my own. If you could give me your recollections I should\nbe much obliged.\u2014Yours sincerely,\nArthur Berry.\nMr. Larmor replied : \u2014\nApril 6th, 1898.\nDear Berry,\u2014My recollection of the curious coincidence to which you\nrefer is as follows :\u2014Clare, Caius, King's and Trinity Hall were grouped for\n\f276 [part\nAlice Johnson.\nexamination purposes ; you were one of the examiners representing King's,\nand I one of those representing Clare. I believe Statics was one of the\nsubjects assigned to me, and we were each requested to supply three or four\nproblems for the problem paper, representing more or less the subjects\nassigned to us for the ordinary papers. The procedure was as follows. An\neditor was appointed who should collect the problems from the various\nexaminers, arrange them, and see to the printing of the problem paper, its\ncirculation among the examiners, and the insertion of corrections suggested\nby them. This was, I believe, Stearn (or Bell?). The problem was set by\nme as an example of the principle of Virtual Work. On receiving the proof\nof the problem paper, I saw that it had been printed twice and drew the\neditor's attention to it. It turned out, however, that the explanation was\nthat j'ou had also sent it in among your problems. While the problems were\npractically identical, I recollect that my version was a trifle more general\nthan yours, inasmuch as it had reference to the diagonals as well as the edges\nof the parallelepiped. [The italics are mine. A.J.] This version was\nretained in the paper and you sent a substitute for the other. We were\nboth struck at the time by the curious coincidence and discussed the matter,\nbut were unable to come to the conclusion that we were led to set the\nproblem by any train of ideas we had in common.\nThe problem was quite new, I had not discussed it with anybody, and\nthe editor of the problem paper was the only person to whom I had\ncommunicated it.\u2014Very sincerely yours, Alex Larmor\nMr. Berry wrote, enclosing Mr. Larmor's letter :\u2014\nKing's College, Cambridge, April 8th, 1898.\nDkar Miss Johnson,\u2014Here is Mr. Larmor's \"narrative.\" The only\ndiscrepancy which I notice between his account and mine is in the sentence\n[italicised]. It is quite irrelevant to the coincidence and merely affects the\nquestion of our \"credibility.\" I think that my problem referred to the\ndiagonals (strings) only, and he thinks that it referred to the edges (rods)\nonly, omitting the strings, so that virtually the results which he thinks that I\nasked for and those which I think that I asked for are exactly comple\nmentary, and together make up practically what he (as we both agree) asked\nfor.-Yours sincerely, Arthur BEKry\nI first heard of this case orally from Mr. Berry, when he drew\na diagram of a parallelepiped with dotted lines connecting the four\npairs of opposite vertices, to explain to me what the problem wa.s.\nThis diagram shows that his recollection of the general nature of\nthe problem at that time was correct, as afterwards verified by refer\nence to the printed question.\nCase 39.\nThe next is a series of three coincidences,\u2014all apparently purely\naccidental with the possible exception of the first,\u2014taken from Over\nthe Teacups, by Oliver Wendell Holmes (3rd Edition, 1891, p. 12, tt\n\fXXXV.] 277\nCoincidences.\nseq.) We are told in the Introduction that the part of the book\ncontaining these cases was written in March, 1888.\n(p. 12) ... I relate a singular coincidence which very lately\noccurred in my experience. ... I will firat copy the memorandum\nmade at the time :\u2014\n\" Remarkable coincidence. On Monday, April 18th, being at table from\n6.30 p.m. to 7.30, with and [the two ladies of my household], I\ntold them of the case of ' trial by battel ' offered by Abraham Thornton in\n1817. I mentioned his throwing down his glove, which was not taken up by\nthe brother of his victim, and so he had to be let off, for the old law was still\nin force. I mentioned that Abraham Thornton was said to have come to this\ncountry, ' and [I added] he may be living near us for aught that I know.' 1\nrose from the table and found an English letter waiting for me, left while\nI sat at dinner. I copy the first portion of this letter :\u2014\n' 20, Alfred Place West (near Museum), South Kensington,\nLondon, S.W., April 7th, 1887.\n' Db. O. W. Holmes,\u2014Dear Sik,\u2014In travelling the other day I met with\na reprint of the very interesting case of Thornton for murder, 18 L7. The\nprisoner pleaded successfully the old Wager of Battel. I thought you would\nlike to read the account, and send it with this . . . \u2014Yours faithfully,\n' Fred. Rathbone.' \"\nMr. Rathbone is a well-known dealer in old Wedgwood and eighteenth\ncentury art. As a friend of my hospitable entertainer, Mr. Willett, he had\nshown me many attentions in England, but I was not expecting any com\nmunication from him ; and when, fresh from my conversation, I found this\nletter just arrived by mail and left while I was at table, and on breaking\nthe seal read what I had a few moments before been telling, I was greatly\nsurprised, and immediately made a note of the occurrence, as given above.\nI had long been familiar with all the details of this celebrated case, but\nhad not referred to it, so far as I can remember, for months or years. I\nknow of no train of thought which led me to speak of it on that particular\nday. I had never alluded to it before in that company, nor had I ever\nspoken of it with Mr. Rathbone. . . .\nThe case I have given is, I am confident, absolutely free from every\nsource of error. I do not remember that Mr. Rathbone had communicated\nwith me since he sent me a plentiful supply of mistletoe a year ago last\nChristmas. The account I received from him was cut out of The Sporting\nTimes of March 5th, 1887. My own knowledge of the case came from\nKirby's Wonderful Museum, a work presented to me at least thirty years ago.\nI had not looked at the account, Bpoken of it, nor thought of it for a long\ntime, when it came to me by a kind of spontaneous generation, as it seemed,\nhaving no connection with any previous train of thought that I was aware of.\nI consider the evidence of entire independence, apart from possible\n\"telepathic\" causation, completely waterproof, airtight, incombustible, and\nunassailable.\n(p. 18). I referred, when first reporting this curious case of coincidence,\nwith suggestive circumstances, to two others, one of which I said was the\n\f278 [part\nAlice Johnson.\nmost picturesque and the other the most unlikely, as it would seem, to\nhappen. This is the first of those two cases :\u2014\nGrenville Tudor Phillips was a younger brother of George Phillips, my\n\u2022college classmate, and of Wendell Phillips, the great orator. He lived in\nEurope a large part of his life, but at last returned, and, in the year 1863.\ndied at the house of his brother George. I read his death in the paper ;\nbut, having seen and heard very little of him during his life, should not have\nbeen much impressed by the fact but for the following occurrence : between\nthe time of Grenville Phillips's death and his burial I was looking in upon\nmy brother, then living in the house in which we were both bom. Some\nbooks which had been my father's were stored in shelves in the room 1 used\nto occupy when at Cambridge. Passing my eye over them, an old dark quarto\nattracted my attention. It must be a Bible, I said to myself,\u2014perhaps a rare\none,\u2014the \" Breeches \" Bible or some other interesting specimen. I took it\nfrom the shelves, and as I did so, an old slip of paper fell out and fluttered\nto the floor. On lifting it I read these words : The, name u> Grenville Titdor.\nWhat wras the meaning of this slip of paper coming to light at this time, after\nreposing undisturbed so long ? There was only one way of explaining its\npresence in my father's old Bible,\u2014a copy of the Scriptures which I did not\nremember ever having handled or looked into before. In christening a child\nthe minister is liable to forget the name just at the moment when he ought to\nremember it. My father preached occasionally at the Brattle Street Church.\nI take this for granted, for I remember going with him on one occasion when\nhe did so. Nothing was more likely than that he should be asked to officiate\nat the baptism of the younger son of his wife's first cousin, Judge Phillips.\nThis slip was handed him to remind him of the name. He brought it home,\nput it in that old Bible, and there it lay quietly for nearly half a century,\nwhen, as if it had just heard of Mr. Phillips's decease, it flew from its hiding\nplace and startled the eyes of those who had just read his name in the daily\ncolumn of deaths. It would be hard to find anything more than a mere\ncoincidence here ; but it seems curious enough to be worth telling.\nThe second of these two last stories must be told in prosaic detsiil to show\nits whole value as a coincidence.\nOne evening while I was living in Charles Street, I received a call from\nDr. S., a well-known and highly respected Boston physician, a particular\nfriend of the late Alexander H. Stephens, vice-president of the Southern\nConfederacy. It was with reference to a work which Mr. Stephens was\nabout to publish that Dr. S. called upon me. After talking that matter over\nwe got conversing on other subjects, among the rest a family relationship\nexisting between us,\u2014not a very near one, but one which I think I had seen\nmentioned in genealogical accounts. Mary S. (the last name being the same\nas that of my visitant), it appeared, was the great-great-grandmother of Mrs.\nH. and myself. After cordially recognising our forgotten relationship, now\nfor the first time called to mind, we parted, my guest leaving me for his own\nhome. We had been sitting in my library on the lower floor. On going\nupstairs where Mrs. H. was sitting alone, just as I entered the room she\npushed a paper across the table towards me, saying that perhaps it might\ninterest me. It was one of a number of old family papers which she had\nbrought from the house of her mother, recently deceased.\n\fXXXV.] 279\nCoincidences.\nI opened the paper, which was an old-looking document, a^nd found that\nit was a copy, perhaps made in this century, of the will of tiat same Mary\nS., about whom we had been talking downstairs.\nIf there is such a thing as a purely accidental coincidence, this must be\nconsidered an instance of it. All that one can say about it is that it seems\nvery unlikely that such a coincidence should occur, but it did.\nDreams about letters, coinciding with their actual arrival and\ncorrectly representing some part of their contents, are comparable to\nDr. Holmes' first case, but belong to a class which is stronger\nevidentially, since dreams about any subjects must be on the whole\nless frequent than mere impulses to talk about them. I give two\ncases of such coincidental dreams.1\nCase 40. [L. 955.]\nThe first comes from Sir Lawrence Jones, Bart.,2 ; the account has\nthe advantage of having been written on the day of the incident.\nVentnor, March 23rd, 1891.\nI was called at eight this morning, and my letters left outside the door.\nI fell asleep again, and had what seemed a long and troublesome dream\nabout a cheque which I had to fill up and sign. At nine I awoke, with a\nvivid recollection of my dream, got up, opened a packet of letters forwarded\nfrom home, and found among them a registered letter containing a cheque\nfor a large sum, which I had to sign as trustee. L J J\nN.B. \u20141 had no reason to expect the receipt of the cheque. The dream\nwas not in any way concerned with the real cheque, but was rather my\nineffectual attempts to draw a cheque properly on a blank sheet of papor.\nBut the coincidence was very remarkable.\nLady Jones writes :\u2014\nApril 1st, 1893.\nI can entirely corroborate from my own memory the story of my\nhusband's dream about the cheque. Evelyn M. Jones.\n1 For other instances of this kind, see the Journal S.P.R., Vol. VI., pp. 103 and\n105, and Vol. VII., p. 257. In connection with these cases, I may refer to a curious\nnon-coincidental case published in the \"Report on the Census of Hallucinations\"\n{Proceedings, Vol. X., p. 91) of an extremely vivid, though apparently not fully\nexternalised, vision of a number of letters lying on a (real) table in a room adjoining\nthat in which the percipient was lying in bed. The door was shut, so that he could not\nreally see the table ; but along with the vision came the conviction that the letters\ncontained news of the death of all his relations. On going into the room, he found\nno letters there and nothing occurred later to confirm the presentiment. The\npercipient (who is personally known to some members of the Committee who drew\nup the \"Report on the Census \") declared that he was certainly awake and with his eyes\nopen when the vision occurred, and he seems to have had no sense of awakening\nfrom it.\n\u2022 For another experience of Sir Lawrence Jones', see below, p. 290.\nC\n\f280 [part\nAlice Johnson.\nSir Lawrence Jones writes later :\u2014\nCranmer Hall, Fakenhara, April 1st, 1893.\nI related my dream to Lady Jones immediately after opening my letter.\nThis dream was unusually vivid, and the impression of it remained with me\nmuch longer than usual. I dream a good deal, but rarely remember any\nthing except in the case of morning dreams, when I have woken early and\ngone to sleep again.\nCase 41. [L. 998.J\nThe next case rests on unusually good evidence, since it was noted\nbefore verification, while the full account of it was written from notes\nmade immediately after by Professor A. Alexander, of Rio Janeiro.\nHe says, in sending the account :\u2014\nMy informant, Senhor Nascimento, is a life member of the \" Society oi\nArts,\" and received his technical education in London.\nA recent case of apparent clairvoyance has been communicated to me\nby a Brazilian engineer, called Jos(S Custodio Fernandes do NascimenUi,\nwho is himself the percipient. I have been acquainted with this gentlemau\nfor several years and know him to be a careful and trustworthy witness. It\nwill be seen that he has enabled me also to give direct testimony to the\ncare with which he has provided for proper evidence.\nIn thus proceeding, he endeavours to atone for former laxness, inasmuch\nas some seven or eight years ago he failed to take adequate note of a\nprobably veridical dream, in which he seemed to be trying to escape with\nhis family from the deck of a burning vessel, and to witness the jumping\noverboard of a man whose clothes had caught fire. A telegram from a\nnorthern Brazilian port subsequently gave the news that about that time\nfire had broken out on board a certain vessel, and that on the occasion some\nindividual had in reality jumped into the sea, more or less in the manner\nperceived in the dream.\nShortly after three p.m. on Saturday, January 11th, 189G, I met Senhor\nNascimento in the Rua do Ouvidor in this city, and he at once gave me\nverbal particulars of a second experience of the kind, which he had had on\nthat very date.\nHe stated that, as the result of slackness in his business, he had lately\nbeen straitened for want of means, and had felt this impecuniosity all the\nmore that his eldest daughter is shortly to be married to the son of a Don\nJ., a merchant resident in Montevideo.\nOn the preceding evening of the 10th, the young man J. came to visit\nhisfiancee at the usual hour, and mentioned that a letter from his father was\nwaiting for Senhor Nascimento in the Rua da Alfandega at the firm of Jorge\nDias Brothers, the correspondents in Rio of Don J. He had not brought it\nhimself, as it was to be delivered to Senhor Nascimento personally.\nMy informant awoke on the following morning at an early hour, and fell\nagain into a state of slumber between 5 and 6 o'clock. He then dreamt\nFebruary 41h, 1896.\nRio, Felmuiry 3rd, 1896.\n\fXXXV.] 281\nCoincidences.\nthat he had called at Dias Brothers and that they handed him a present\nfrom Don J. of one conto of reis (about \u00a340), which he was so glad to\nreceive that he embraced the members of that firm with an effusion of tears.\nIn the dream he seemed to count the money.\nHe rose with the conviction that his vision would be realised, although\nno ordinary reasons concurred to make him suppose that such would be the\ncase. This belief led him to write down on a slip of paper (which is here\nwith enclosed) the following note :\u2014\n' ' Sonhei que ao ir receber a carta dos Senhores Jorge Dias estes me\nentregaram a somma de 1 : 000 $ 000 de reis, e que eu commovido abracei-os\nchorando.\" ' 11-1-96.\n(\" I dreamt that on going to receive the letter from Senhores Jorge Dias,\nthe latter delivered to me the sum of 1 : 000 \u00a7 000 of reis, and that I, being\nmoved, embraced them with tears.\" 11-1-96.)\nSenhor Nascimento said nothing to his wife or children about the dream.\nHe merely put the above note under other papers in a pigeon-hole of his\nbureau, which he then locked. He went into town ; called at half-past ten\nat the house of Jorge Dias Brothers, and received the letter, which he\nafterwards opened in the street. This letter he showed to me when we met.\nIn it Don J. makes a present of one conto of reis to his future daughter-in-\nlaw, and instructs Senhor Nascimento to draw the money at the house of\nJohn Moore and Co. of this city. This sum Senhor Nascimento had duly\nreceived about 1 o'clock on that day, and he invited me to accompany him\nhome to verify what he had stated regarding the note taken in the morning.\nThe conto of reis was shown to me ; the bureau was opened in my presence,\nand the slip of paper was taken out of the pigeon-hole and immediately\ndelivered into my keeping.\nOn Monday the 13th, I returned for further information. By direct\nquestioning, Senhor Nascimento had learnt that his friends, the Dias\nBrothers, were not aware of the contents of the letter at the time of its\nreceipt. A similar declaration was made in my hearing by the young man\nJ. who added, however, that he had afterwards (i.e., at an hour later than\nthat of the dream) been informed by a brother of his what their father\nhad done.\nJohn Moore and Co. are not personally known to my informant. J.'s\nbrother has no other connection with him than that established by the\ncoming union between the families, and yet the dream coincided with the\narrival of the letter at Rio and not with its despatch from Montevideo. The\ncircumstances of the case, then, seem to render the explanation by clair\nvoyance more plausible than that by telepathy.\nSenhor Nascimento states that, although he sometimes has waking\npresentiments, the two dreams above narrated are the only vivid ones of the\nkind he recollects having had in his experience. He does not remember\never receiving similarly positive indications in a vision, which have remained\nunfulfilled.\n(The above is written out from notes taken by me on the date of the\noccurrence.)\nA. Alexander.\nV 2\n\f282 Alice Johnson.\nProfessor Alexander's account is confirmed as follows by the\npercipient :\u2014\nRio, February 3rd, 1896.\nI can testify to the fulness and exactness of all the details above given.\nI still have a vivid remembrance of the dream of the burning vessel, the\nconfirmation of which came on the same day. A man was reported to have\njumped overboard with his clothes on fire, just as I saw him in my dream.\nI reside at No. 33, Travessa de S5o Salvador, Haddock Lob\u00ab, half-an-\nhour's journey from town in the tramcars, and I never come home during\nthe course of the day. Jorf 0. Fernandbs do Nascimento.\nThe original note, made by Senhor Nascimento on the morning\nafter his dream and before its verification, was sent with the narrative\nby Professor Alexander.\nCases referring to the arrival of persons may be compared with\nthose relating to the arrival of letters. Here is one in which the\nimpression about the arrival seems to have coincided with the sup\nposed agent's planning of his arrival. It is in one respect somewhat\nstronger evidentially than the cases just given, since the impression was\na waking one\u2014though possibly an illusion rather than a hallucination.\nOn the other hand, the incident to which the impression referred was\nof a less unusual kind.\nCase 42. [L. 995.]\nThis case was received from Mrs. C. R. Gritting, an Associate\nof the American Branch of the S.P.R., who is well-known to\nDr. Hodgson. She made the following note of what she had heard\nfrom the percipient, her daughter-in-law, before they knew that it had\nany correspondence with the actual facts :\u2014\nBox 14, White Plains, New York, June 13th, 1891.\nJust now I am feeling much worried about my son Horace, who is\naway. My sister, who has many times made correct predictions, wrote me\nthat she saw Horace very ill, and last evening my daughter-in-law, after she\nwent to her room, heard Horace, as she supposed, enter the basement\nkitchen ; she heard him rock in his favourite large chair and move about.\nThis morning, when I went down to breakfast, she said, \" Horace came,\ndidn't he ? \" She was so sure that he came that she had more coffee made\nfor him. Just now I am the only one who drinks coffee. She thought she\nheard me early this morning ask him how he was feeling. All this may not\nbe premonitory, but it worries me. JaN8 r. Griffh.g.\nHer son actually returned home the next day, and Mrs. Griffing\nwrote shortlv after :\u2014\n[June 28th, 1891.]\nThe morning of June 13th, when I went down to breakfast, my daughter\"-\nin-law remarked carelessly, \"Horace came last night, didn't he ?\" \"No,'\"\n\fXXXV.] Coincidences.\nI said, \"he did not come.\" \"But I heard him come,\" she exclaimed, in a\nsurprised tone. \"Are you sure he isn't here?\" I answered that I was\nsure. \"But,\" she persisted, \"did you look into the room? I am sure I\nheard him.\" It was difficult to convince her that he was not .somewhere\nabout. He had been away only a few days, was well, as far as we knew, and\nwe had no reason to be anxious about him. The next day he returned and\ntold me that he came very near coming the evening before, but after talking\nit over with Charley he decided to wait until the next day. They both told\nme of their discussing it about eight o'clock.\nJane R. Griffing.\nThe precipient describes her impression as follows :\u2014\nDuring the evening of June 12th, about eight o'clock, I went to my\nroom. Some time before nine, I heard my brother-in-law, Horace, come to\nthe basement-kitchen door ; finding it locked he went to a window, raised\nit and stepped in. I heard him strike a match, move about the room, and\nsit down in a large rocking chair. I was so absolutely sure that it was\nHorace that I did not go down to see who it was, or speak to my mother-in-\nlaw about it. I supposed she knew that Horace was there. The reason I\nwas so sure that it was Horace instead of any one else was that my other\nbrother-in-law was in the house, my husband would not come until the next\nday, and all the movements I heard were exactly like Horace's habits when\nhe had been out and came in by the basement, especially his sitting and\nrocking in that particular chair.\nPhebe L. Griffino.\nMr. C. L. Gritting and his brother give the following account of\nwhat they were doing at the time :\u2014\nThe evening of June 12th, my brother Horace and I were together for an\nhour or so before nine o'clock. It must have been about eight when we\nwere discussing the question of his returning to White Plains that night, or\nwaiting until the next day and [going] up with me. He was quite inclined\nat first to go by a late train that evening, but decided to wait until the\nnext day.\nChas. L. Griffing.\nMy brother's account of the conversation between us in regard to my\nreturning home during the evening of June 12th is correct. It could not\nhave been far from eight o'clock, as we were not together until after seven,\nand separated before nine.\nH. M. Griffing.\nIn answer to Dr. Hodgson's further enquiries, Mrs. Griffing\nwrites :\u2014\nBox 14, White Plains, New York, April 1st. [1892.]\nIn reply to your enquiry, at the time of the telepathic incident of\nJune 12th, it was entirely uncertain when Horace would return ; he might\ncome at any time and might not for weeks. He was in the City for a\nspecial purpose and did not know what the result would be. I was not ex\npecting him at that time, as it was too soon for him to know what his plans\n\f284 [part\nAlice Johnson.\nwould be, and he returned only for two or three days. I was not in the\nleast anxious about him, as he was well and in no trouble of any kind.\nJane R. Gripping.\nCase 43.\nThe following case comes from Dr. A. S. Wiltse, whose name will\nbe familiar to readers of the Proceedings and Journal. His success\nas agent in many experiments in thought-transference adds consider\nably to the probability that the apparition was veridical. On the other\nhand, the absence of anything at all remarkable or strikingly unusual\nin his condition at the time is, of course, a weak point. The per\ncipient, Dr. VViltse's son, writes to Dr. Hodgson :\u2014,\nLancing, Tenn., February loth, 1896.\nDear Sir,\u2014On the night of the 15th of January last my father was away\nfrom home.\nAs the night was somewhat cold and there was fire in his room, I occupied\nhis bed. During the night I awoke and saw, as I supposed, my father lying\nin bed on the front side. He seemed to be sleeping quietly, and his left\narm was lying at full length on the top of the coverlet.\nI got carefully out of bed, thinking not to awaken him, covered up the\nfire to keep for morning, and stood close to him looking at him, and cogita\nting whether to go back to my own bed ; but, preferring the warm room, I\nsaid to myself, \" He sneaked in with me, so I'll sneak in with him.\" I got in\nbed, and fell to sleep, but afterwards, waking up, discovered that he was\ngone. I supposed he had been called away, but learned in the morning that\nhe had not been at home. \u2014Yours truly,\nJason Wiltse.\nDr. Wiltse adds :\u2014\nLancing, Morgan Co., Tenn., February 14th, 1896.\nMy Dear Dr. Hodgson,\u2014. . . I send an account of an apparition > >f\nmyself.\nMy share in the apparition is this :\u2014\nOn the night in question I was staying at the hoVise of Mr. W. T.\nHoward, two miles from home. I was tired out, and stopped because 1 really\ncould go no farther.\nI had to sleep with two boys who had bad colds, and was so annoyed with\nthem that I laid awake wishing I was at home in my own room, and pictur\ning to myself the comfortable fire, bed, &c., that I was missing, until I was\nnear atone time rising and going home, but concluded I was feeling too weak\nto make the journey.\nOn my arrival home my son told me of seeing me, as he supposed, in my\nbed before I had mentioned the matter, or, in fact, thought of the possi\nbility of my having produced any telepathic impression.\u2014Yours truly,\nA. S. Wiltse.\nI give next two cases of apparent thought-transference relating to\nanimals. There is of course no prima facie reason why people should\nnot have veridical impressions about animals as much as about any\n\fXXXV.] 285\nCoincidences.\nother beings in whom they are strongly interested. It has often been\npointed out that such cases do not involve, of necessity, an animal\n\" agent,\" since\u2014at least in all that I have ever met with\u2014there is\nalways a human being concerned from whose mind the percipient\nmight have gathered the intelligence, apart from the possibility of\nindependent clairvoyance. It is clear that the idea of a dog might be\nconveyed from one mind to another as easily as the idea of any other\nobject\u2014neither the dog nor the object taking any part in the process\u2014\nand a real dog just as well as the imaginary dog, who figures in one of\nmy cases.\nIt is, however, altogether irrelevant to the main purpose of this\npaper to discuss how this or that supernormal or apparently super\nnormal incident may have been caused. I am not concerned to argue\nthat the mind of an animal cannot communicate directly \u2014by thought-\ntransference\u2014with the mind of a human being. I maintain only that,\nhowever probable such a hypothesis may be, the evidence in our\npossession so far hardly even suggests it; because the well-authenticated\ncases of supposed telepathy from animals are so few that they can\neasily be put down to chance. Regarded, however, as cases of clair\nvoyance, or of telepathy from one human being to another, they go to\n\u00abwell the bulk of cases of these classes, and consequently to reduce the\npossibility of attributing them to chance.\nCask 44. [L. 1075.]\nThis case was received by Mr. Myers in December, 1890,1 from Mrs.\nBagot, writing from The Palace, Hampton Court. Both Mrs. Bagot\nand her daughter, who confirms the account, are known to Mr. Myers.\nIn the year 1883 we were staying at the Hotel des Anglais, at Mentone.\nI had left at home (in Norfolk) in the care of our gardener a very favourite\nlittle dog, a black and tan terrier, named Judy. I was sitting at table d'hote\nand suddenly saw my dog run across the room, and unthinkingly exclaimed,\n\" Why, there's Judy ! \" There was no dog in the hotel, and when I went up\nstairs I told my daughter, who was ill, what I had seen. A few days after\nI got a letter saying that Judy had gone out with the gardener as usual in\nthe morning quite well, but when he returned at breakfast time she was\nsuddenly taken ill, and died in half-an-hour. At this distance of time I\ncannot distinctly remember whether the dates agreed, but my impression is\nthat she had died the day I saw her. Mary Bagot\nMrs. Bagot's daughter, Mrs. Wodehouse, sent to Mr. Myers on\nFebruary 9th, 1896, the following corroboration, stating that the\n1 In February, 18UU, Mrs. Bagot wrote a second account of the same incident,\nwhich was printed in the Journal S.P.R. for April, 1S96, with her daughter,s con\nfirmation, then obtained for the first time. Theearlieraccount, here given, is practically\nidentical with the later one, so that Mrs. Bagot's recollection of the circumstances\ndoes not seem to have varied.\n\f286 [part\nAlice Johnson.\nquotations were an exact copy of the references to the dog in her diary\nfor March 24th and 28th, 1883.

My\nmother was so positive about it, that one of the others (I think my father)\nhad asked the waiter if there were any dogs in the hotel, and he had answered\nin the negative. I can find no further mention of the time or day of the\ndog's death in my diary.\nI may also be mistaken in the day on which my mother saw Judy, for\nalthough I usually write my diary every evening, I sometimes leave it for two\nor three days and then write it in as best I can remember.

He writes to Dr. Bramwell : \u2014\nFebruary 5th, 1896.\nDear Dk. Bramwell, \u2014As promised I now send an account of my little\nthought-transference experience. 'Twas thus. I sat opposite my eldest\ndaughter, who was reading a book by the fireside. Presently I exclaimed,\n\"Good gracious ! \" My daughter saying, \"What is it ? \" 1 replied, \" I could\nhave sworn I saw a dog enter the room.\" I described the dog minutely.\nMy daughter in great surprise told me that she had that moment read a\ndescription of just such a dog.

Devon, December 9th, 1897.\nDear Sir William Crookes,\u2014. . . An instance of telepathy has just\noccurred, which I think, on account of its triviality, may be worth putting on\nrecord with names and date.\nThis evening my step-daughter (Mrs. Heriot) and I were sitting together\nin the drawing-room, no one else being present. She was working and I was\nreading to-day's Times. We had not spoken for some time. I had read\nthrough the correspondent's article on the \" Engineering Dispute \" and the\nleading article on the same subject.\nAs I finished, my eye fell on a small print paragraph telling of a gas\nexplosion caused by looking for an escape with a light. Without reading it I\nexclaimed aloud \" Oh ! What idiots some people are ! \" Mrs. Heriot replied\ninstantly \" Yes, aas.\"\nSo far the bare fact. Much astonished I said, \" How on earth did you\nknow I meant gas ? \" \"I do not know,\" she replied, \" but as you said ' Oh ! '\nI saw a man looking for a gas escape with a light.\"\nMy step-daughter and I have been close friends for more than thirty\nyears, and have often noticed how we speak of the same things simul\ntaneously. But nothing so striking as this has occurred before. .\n-Yours very sincerely, Arabella B. Fisher.\nI should perhaps say that Mrs. Heriot was sitting on the opposite side of\nthe fire, that she had not read the paper, and had no clue as to what part\nwas reading.\nIn reply to inquiries Mrs. Heriot writes :\u2014\nElmcroft, Newton Abbot, S. Devon, December 17th, 1897.\nDear Sir,\u2014. . . Mrs. Fisher has asked me to write to you about\nwhat occurred the other evening. I was sitting on one side of the fireplace,\nworking, she on the other, reading the Times. She looked up, saying, \"Oh !\n'what fools some people are ! \" As she spoke, it flashed through my mind,\n\f288 Alice Johnson.\nas if she had read aloud, that some person had taken a light to look for an\nescape of gas, and thereby caused an explosion\u2014so I at once answered\n\" Yes, gas.\"\u2014I am, yours faithfully,\nRose Mackay Heriot.\nCase 47.\nThe next\u2014a case in which a dying mother had an apparently\ntelepathic vision of an absent son who happened to be dying at the\nsame time\u2014is one of those cases which seem to indicate a heightening\nof certain faculties at the approach of death.\nFrom Colonel C. F. Hicks.\n46, Valplaisant, St. Heliers, Jersey, December 23rd, 1889.\nAgreeably to my promise I now give you a statement of my late wifeV\nlast moments. Some days beforehand I was informed she would not last\nlong ; and it was in the evening about 5 or 6 o'clock p.m., on 3rd October.\n1887, I went into her bedroom. There was the nurse, my second and third\ndaughters in the room with me. The door was a little ajar. She was look\ning at it very earnestly when she said to my second daughter, Flo, \" Then.-\nis some one outside, let him in.\" Flo answered and said, \" Oh, no, mamma:\nthere is no one\u2014look,\" and she opened the door wider. We then talked to\nher gently for some little time. After a pause she said, \" Poor Eddie (my\nsecond son, who had gone out to Australia) ; oh, he is looking very ill\u2014be\nhas had a fall\u2014broken his leg\u2014poor Eddie.\" When we all assured her such\nwas not the case\u2014that the last news we had heard from him was that he\nwas quite well\u2014she became more pacified, although restless and doubtful,\nas she continued to say new and then, \" Poor Eddie ! \" She died at about\n20 minutes to 2 a.m., early on the 4th October. We little thought that her\nwords would be verified, with the exception of the broken leg.\nSome time afterwards I received a letter from Mr. Thomas Williams\nannouncing my poor son's death. For he left a place called Wyndham on\nthe Cambridge Gulf, N.W. of Australia, on the 4th [evidently meaning 3rd.\nsee below] October, 1887, with a young man of the name of Russell. He\nsuddenly felt ill and called for some water. The latter went off to a spring\nto get it, but coming back he found that he had fallen from his horse and\nwas lying quite dead. So his poor mother's vision turned out to be quite\ntrue, excepting his leg being broken.\nNow, the only question is about the time. Did the son die before the\nmother or after the mother ? as, taking the longitude of Wyndham N.W. of\nAustralia, so far to the east of us, there must be a good eight or ten hours,\ndifference, and a ship going round the world making east all the way would\ngain a day, and by westing would lose one.\nI give you a few extracts from letters I have received. The one from Mr.\nThomas Williams, with whom my son left a letter to be sent on to me. Mr.\nT. VV.'s letter is dated the 5th October, 1887 : \"Your son left Wyndham togo\nto Duraok station on the 3rd October, in company with Louis Smith and John\nRussell. They had to go over a very rough country, and your poor boy\nBuccumbed to the pangs of thirst, suffering at the same time with fever. I\nam glad to inform you that his sufferings were short, and that the great God\nwas pleased to take him away quickly. He spoke very affectionately of hi*\n\fXXXV.] 289\nCoincidences.\nmother, and what he would do if he could only get back to Jersey, for he\nwas heartsick when he was here.\"\nI give you another extract from his employer, a Mr. Durack, a gentle\nman who dealt largely in horses, and had a great number of horse stations\nin Australia :\n\" When I left your son at Wyndham on 27th September last, 1887, he was\nto start back to the station, as he had a horse, bridle, and saddle to ride.\"\nIn conclusion, I have now given you as succinctly as I can the death of\nthe mother and son, the one having taken place here and the other at our\nAntipodes, both on the same day and date, and as far as I know about the\nsame time. It is more than a coincidence\u2014it is very mysterious.\n(Signed) C. F. Hicks.\nColonel Hicks writes later :\u2014\nFebruary 22nd, 1890.\n. . . The witnesses in my wife's late case are none of them present\nhere. My second daughter, whom I was expecting from Bombay when I\nreceived your letter, has arrived here. Her statement I enclose. My third\ndaughter, another witness, is at present at Brisbane, in Australia. It will\ntake some time before I can receive an answer from her. As to the nurse\nwho was attending my late wife, She is residing in Dublin ... I must\nwrite to her, as her address is Miss E. Fenn, 16, Adelaide-road, Dublin, to\ngive her statement of the case.\nDiscrepancy in dates : my late wife died at about 40 minutes to\n2 a.m. on 4th October, 1887\u2014that is taking the time from 12 a.m. on\nthe 3rd to 12 p.m., after which it becomes the 4th. So all the conversa-\nsation that took place with the above-named witnessses, viz., the nurse,\nMiss E. Fenn, two daughters and self, took place in the evening of the\n3rd, about 5 or 6 p.m., as she died the same night, or more correctly speak\ning, being after 12 p.m., it was early in the morning of the 4th.\nNow for my son's death. Mr. Thomas Williams' letter is dated the 5th\nOctober, 1887. He says my son left Wyndham, on the Gulf of Cambridge, on\nthe 4th [the date given ill Mr. Williams' letter is 3rd, see below] October,\n1887, but he does not mention at what time. But being within the tropics,\nwhere people generally travel as early as they can to escape the heat of the\nsun, it is presumed that he and his friend, Mr. Russell, must have started\nearly, and it is certain that they could not have gone far before he met his\nend, and most probably Mr. T. Williams must have heard of it the same\nday, as his letter is dated the 5th October, 1887. . . .\n(Signed) C. F. Hicks.\nThe following letter from Miss Hicks was enclosed :\u2014\nFebruary 27th, 1890.\nI was in my late mother's bedroom between the hours of 5 and C in the\nevening, on the 3rd of October, 1887, when she asked me to open the door,\nas some one was outside and wanted to come in. I answered and said, \"Oh,\nmother, the door is open, and there is no one outside,\" and then I opened\nthe door wider. Then I shut the door. She then said, \" Poor Eddie, he\nlooks very ill ; he has had a fall.\" 1 said to her, \" Oh, mother, how you go\non ; he is all right the last time we heard.\" She said, \"Oh, he is looking\n\f-290 Alice Johnson.\nvery ill.\" The next morning, at about 40 minutes to 2 a.m., she died. 1\nheard from letters received that my poor brother Eddie died in Australia >m\nthe same day and about the same time. j. Hicks.\nColonel Hicks also sent us the letter from Mr. Williams, giving\nan account of his son's death. The exact time is, as Colonel Hicks\nsays, not stated, but the letter is dated October 5th, 1887, and stata\nthat Mr. E. Hicks started on his journey on October 3rd. It seem?\nprobable that the death took place on the same day.\nThe following case affords perhaps stronger evidence for telepathy\nthan any others in this section, on account of the collective nature of\nthe experience.\nCase 48. [L. 953.]\nMr. Myers writes :\u2014\nThe following case was sent to me by Sir Lawrence Jones, Bart., a\nmember of the S.P.K. In conversation he described to me the singular and\npersistent distress accompanying the nocturnal alarm.\u2014F.W.H.M.\nCranmer Hall, Fakenham, Norfolk, April 26th, 1893.\nOn August 20th, 1884, I was staying at my father-in-law's house at Bury\nSt. Edmunds. I had left my father in perfectly good health about a fort\nnight before. He was at home at this address. About August 18th I had\nhad a letter from my mother saying that my father was not quite well, and\nthat the doctor had seen him and made very light of the matter, attributing\nhis indisposition to the extreme heat of the weather.\nI was not in any way anxious on my father's account, as he was rather\nsubject to slight bilious attacks.\nI should add, though, that I had been spending that day, August 20th,\nat Cambridge, and should have stayed the night there had not a sort of\nvague presentiment haunted me that possibly there would be a letter from\nhome the next morning. My wife, too, had a similar strong feeling that if\nI stayed the night at Cambridge I might regret it. In consequence of this\nfeeling I returned to Bury, and that night woke up suddenly to find myself\nstreaming with perspiration and calling out : \" Something dreadful is\nhappening ; I don't know what.\" The impression of horror remained some\ntime, but at last I fell asleep till the morning.\nMy father, Sir Willoughby Jones, died very suddenly of heart, disease\nabout 1 a.m. on August 21st. He was not in his room at the moment, but\nwas carried back to his room and restoratives applied, but in vain.\nMy brother Herbert and I were the only two of the family absent from\nhome at the time. The thoughts of those present (my mother, brother, and\nthree sisters) no doubt turned most anxiously towards us, and it is to a\ntelepathic impression from them in their anxiety and sorrow that I attribute\nthe intimations we received. Lawrence J. Jones.\nLady Jones writes :\u2014\nI have a vivid remembrance of the occurrence related above by my\nhusband. I was sound asleep when he awoke, and seizing me by [the]\n\fXXXV.] 291\nCoincidences.\nwrist exclaimed : \"Such a dreadful thing is happening,\" and I had much\ndifficulty in persuading him that there was nothing wrong.\nHe went to sleep again, but was much relieved in the morning by finding\na long letter from Sir Willoughby, posted the day before, and written in\ngood spirits. Having read this and gone to his dressing-room, however, he\nsoon returned with the telegram summoning him home at once, and said as\nhe came in : \" My impression in the night was only too true.\"\nEvelyn M. Jones.\nMr. Herbert Jones, the other percipient, describes his experience\nas follows :\u2014 ,\nKnebworth Rectory, Stevenage, April 4fh, 1893.\nRecollections of Aitgnst 20th, 1884.\nI had spent the day at Harpenden, and returned home about 8 p.m., and\nwent to bed about 10.30.\nI woke at 12 o'clock, hearing my name called twice, as I fancied. I lit\nmy candle, and, seeing nothing, concluded it was a dream\u2014looked at my\nwatch, and went to sleep again.\nI woke again and heard people carrying something downstairs from the\nupper storey, just outside my room. I lit my candle, got out of bed, and\nwaited till the men were outside my door. They seemed to be carrying\nsomething heavy, and came down step by step.\nI opened my door, and it was pitch dark. I was puzzled and dumb\nfounded. I went to my sitting-room and into the hall, but everything was\ndark and quiet. 1 went back to bed convinced I had been the sport of\nanother nightmare. It was about 2 a.m. by my watch. At breakfast next\nmorning on my plate was a telegram telling me to come home.\nThis whole story may be nothing, but it was odd that I should have\ntwice got up in one night, and that during that night and those hours my\nfather was dying.\nH. E. Jones.\nSir Lawrence Jones adds :\u2014\nMy brother was then a .curate in London, living at 32, Palace Street,\nWestminster, where the above experience took place.\u2014L. J. J.\nCONCLUSION.\nIn conclusion, some justification may appear necessary for dis\ncussing at so great a length and with so much detail the possible\nscope of accidental coincidences in various departments of Psychical\nResearch.\nAny empirical treatment of a subject partakes to some extent of\nthe nature of statistics, and to persons who are not actively engaged\nin collecting and studying them, statistics generally appear not only\nintolerably tedious, but essentially unreliable. Statistics\u2014it is com\nmonly said\u2014can be made to prove anything. And it is quite true\n\f292 Alice Johnson.\nthat they can be made to prove anything, so long as arguments are\ndrawn\u2014as is too often done\u2014from mere collections of percentages,\nwhile the possible agency of Chance in producing many of the\npercentages is ignored.\nThe general necessity of allowing for Chance in the ordinary\nempirical sciences, indeed, has always been recognised. If a bac\nteriologist is trying to discover what will destroy certain germs, he\nis aware that the fact of their dying the first time he introduces a\ncertain substance into their environment does not prove that that\nsubstance caused their death ; their death at that time may have\nbeen an accidental coincidence. This does not discourage him from\nfurther search, as he knows that something caused the death and it is\nhis business to find out what the cause was. But he will never be\nable to prove what it was if he ignores the possible agency of\nChance.\nSimilarly, we cannot substantiate the claims of telepathy or any\nother supposed supernormal faculty by ignoring what Chance may\nbring about. At the same time, there is no necessity for concluding\nthat if supernormal faculties are not at work in all incidents that\nsuggest them, they do not exist at all.\nBut in dealing with the most difficult and obscure of all sciences\n\u2014that of Psychical Research\u2014the necessary process of eliminating\none possible agency after another must be even more lengthy and\ntedious than in any other subject. The present article is nothing\nmore than an attempt to clear some of the ground in a preliminary\nfashion, and is intended to suggest problems rather than to solve\nthem, \u2014 their solution being, as it seems to me, impossible for the\npresent.\nSome points with regard to the construction and characteristics\nof artificial Chance Series are put into Appendix I., so as to avoid too\nmuch interruption of the text ; while the later Appendices contain\ndetailed discussions of individual cases, too lengthy to be included\nin the article itself.\n\fXXXV.] 293\nOn the Construction of Chance Series.\nAPPENDIX I.\n0\\ TIIE CONSTrUCTION OF ArTIFICIAl ClIANCE SErIES.\n[Written jointly with Vf. E. Johnson.]\nThis section contains a further discussion of the method of analysis\nof Chance Series of events into \" cycles,\" of which an example was\ngiven in Chapter II., Table II., p. 189. The series there analysed\nconsisted of 4096 ( = 212) throws of a penny, which were divided into\nconsecutive groups of events, to which the name \" cycles \" was given,\neach group beginning with a head (which had been preceded by a tail)\nand ending with a tail (which was followed by a head). Henceforth\nthroughout this section, we write \"head\" and \"tail\" respectively as\nH and T for brevity. Thus, 17 consecutive throws, HHHTT, HT,\nHHT, HTTT, HHT, would be divided as shown by the commas\ninto five groups or \" cycles.\" The series has to be regarded as a\ncircular one, that is, one in which the end is continuous with the\nbeginning. So that if the series actually ended with one or more\nH's, these would be brought round to the beginning to form the first\npart of the first cycle; and if it actually began with one or more T's,\nthey would be carried round to the end to form the last part of the\nlast cycle.\nThe theoretic number of every different cycle, etc., included in the\nTable was given in each department in italic figures, and it must now\nbe explained how these theoretic numbers, which for the future we\nwill speak of as \" norm numbers\" were obtained.\nEach cycle involves by definition the occurrence of a group of\nevents two more in number than itself, viz., a preceding T (belonging\nto the end of the previous cycle) and a following H (belonging to the\nbeginning of the next cycle) e.g., the cycle HT involves the occurrence\nof the group of events THTH, and so on. Therefore, since there are\ntwo alternative events, the probability of any cycle of events r in\nnumber is (that is, the product of the probabilities of all the\nsingle events) ; and the norm number of such cycles in the series of\n4096 ( = 212) events is \u2014 . For instance, the norm number of cycles\n\\ ; 2r+'i J\n2n\nof HT in that series is -si = 256.\n2*\nThe same method gives the norm numbers of the different runs of\neach alternative. Thus, all the single H's in the top line of the Table\ninvolve the group THT ; all the runs of two H's involve the group\n\f294 Alice Johnson and W. E. Johnson. [past\nTHHT, and so on ; the probability of the former is A and of the\nlatter ~ ; and the norm numbers of them in the series are respectively\nand -jg-- Similarly with the different runs of T's, shown in the\nbottom line of the Table.\nAgain, each cycle\u2014whatever its length may be\u2014involves a single\noccurrence of the group TH at its beginning ;\u2014the occurrence of this\nserving, as it were, to inaugurate each cycle. For instance, taking\nseven throws as follows :\u2014\nT) Hs T2 (H\none complete cycle is included in the middle of this,\u2014between the two\nbrackets,\u2014preceded by a T, which belongs to the previous cycle, and\nfollowed by an H, which belongs to the next cycle. The remainders\nof these two cycles are indicated by the dots. The seven throws\ninclude two occurrences of TH, but it is clear that there is only one\nsuch occurrence for each cycle ; so that the actual number of cycles\nmust always be the same as the actual number of times TH occurs.\nThe norm number of occurrences of TH in our series is 1024.\nThis must therefore be the norm number of cycles in the same series.\nResidual Cycles.\nIt was shown in Chapter II., p. 191, that if we made up the Table\nout of all the cycles the norm number of which is one or more, we\nget only 1013 cycles, instead of the theoretic total of 1024. The\n11 remaining cycles were called \"residual cycles.\" In every series\nanalysed in this way, some residual cycles are found, the number of\nwhich increases absolutely, but decreases relatively, with the length\nof the series; this number being (n \u2014 1) in a series of length 2\".\nIt was remarked in Chapter II. that their exact position in the\nTable had to be settled in an arbitrary manner, but that there were\ndefinite and assignable limits within which they must lie. We now\nproceed to explain how these limits are ascertained.\nNorm Series.\nTo find the limits of the norm distribution of the residual cycles in\nany series, we have recourse to a second method of analysis of the\nseries.\nThe analysis into cycles is a division into mutually exclusive sets\nor \"sequences \" of events ; every event in the series is included in one\nsequence, and in one sequence only. These may, therefore, be called\n\" closed sequences.\"\n\fxxxv.] On the Construction of Chance Series. 295\nAnother method is to divide the series into overlapping sequences,\nof any length we choose to adopt,\u2014so that every event belongs to\nseveral sequences. These may be called \" unclosed sequences \" to\ndistinguish them from the cycles, or 1' closed sequences.\"\nSequences are successions of events, arranged in a denned order ;\ne.g., HHT, HTH, and THH are various sequences of three events, or\nwhat may be called sequences of length 3. A series of events of length\nm may always be regarded as containing m sequences of length r,\nwhere r is any number not greater than m.\nA complete analysis of a brief series on this plan is perhaps\nrequired for clearness, and we will take as an example 5 throws of a\npenny, HHTHT. This must\u2014like the long series already discussed\u2014\nbe conceived of as a circular series ; i.e., we may suppose it to be\nrepeated, so that its initial terms would follow after its final terms. It\ncould be represented in a circular diagram thus :\nwhere the final T is followed by HH, etc., as if the actual series were\nrepeated.\nNow, this circular series of length 5 contains (a) 5 sequences of\nlength 5, viz., HHTHT, HTHTH, THTHH, HTHHT, THHTH ; (b)\n5 sequences of length 4, viz., HHTH, HTHT, THTH, HTHH, THHT;\n(c) 5 sequences of length 3, viz., HHT, HTH, THT, HTH, THH,\n(d) 5 sequences of length 2, viz., HH, HT, TH, HT, TH ; (e) 5\nsequences of length 1, viz., H, H, T, H, T. In all these cases the\nseveral sequences begin at the several successive throws in the series.\nHence the number of sequences is equal to the number of throws.\nIt will, of course, be noticed that all the m sequences in a series of\nlength m are not necessarily different in formation from one another.\nWe count them as m by distinguishing, not their kind or formation,\nbut their position in the series.\nWe may define an ideal or Norm Chance Series as follows :\u2014\nDefinition : If t be the number of alternative events in a series, a\nNorm Series of length tn is a series which contains all the possible\ndifferent sequences of length n which can be made with t alternatives.\nX\n\f296 Alice Johnson and W. E. Johnson, [past\nIt has just been shown above that a series of ln events contains\ntn sequences of any length that we may choose (up to tn). Hence the\nseries of length tn contains, in particular, 1\" sequences of length il\nBut with t alternatives we can (by the rules of Permutations)\nconstruct tn differently constituted sequences of length n. Hence,\naccording to the definition of the Norm Series, each of these differently\nconstituted sequences occurs once, and once only, in it. The occurrence\nof each once corresponds to its probability, which is -~; that is, in any\nseries, tn in length, the norm number for each sequence of length n\nis one.\nDefinitions. In a series of length tn any sequence of length n may\nbe called a unit sequence ; sequences of lengths smaller or greater than\nn may be called minor or major sequences respectively.\nIt will be obvious that in a Norm Series of length tn, every\n\" minor sequence \" (as well as every \" unit sequence \") will occur as\noften as its probability requires. For the probability of a specific\nsequence of length r is \u2014; it ought, therefore, to occur in P* event*\ntn -r ~= tn~r times. But tn~r is the number of ways in which \u25a0\ngiven sequence of length r could be extended into a sequence of\nlength n. Hence the proposition follows.\nBut in the Norm Series of length tn the \" major sequences \" cannot\noccur according to their probability number. For the probability\nnumber of each would be fractional. Thus the probability of a given\nsequence of length n + 1 is ; hence, in tn events, this should occur\ntn 4- *n+1 = \u2014 times, which is impossible.\nHence Tio finite series can be regarded as norm with reference to\nits \" major sequences.\" It will however, of course, contain major\nsequences, since any sequence of length greater than n is a major\nsequence. These have, therefore, to be introduced arbitrarily.\nTo sum up, the conditions of the Norm Series may be stated in the\nform of the rule that in a series of length all the \" unit sequences \"\nof length n must occur each once, so that all the \"minor sequences,\"\nof length r will occur each tn~r times.\nFor instance, out of three alternative events, a, b, and c, 3 sequences\nof length 1, 32 sequences of length 2, and 33 sequences of length 3, can\nbe made. So that a Norm Series of length 32 would contain three of\neach sequence of 1 and one of each sequence of 2 ; and a Norm Series\nof length 33 would contain nine of each sequence of 1, three of each\n\fxxxv.] On the Construction of Chance Series. 297\nsequence of 2, and one of each sequence of 3.

There are,\ntherefore, 9 residual cycles to distribute.\nSince there are 210 different sequences of length 10, each of these\nmust occur once, and once only, in a Norm Series of length 210.\nSimilarly, since there are 29 different sequences of length 9, each of\nthem should occur twice ; and since there are 2s different sequences of\nlength 8, each of them should occur four times, and so on. We cannot\nhere enter into a complete explanation of how all these different\nsequences occur in the series which is summarised in Table III. ; but\nit is obvious that certain sequences of 8, 9, and 10, which are absent\nfrom the part of the Table up to and including the \"diagonal \" from\nH- to T7, \u2014viz., H8, T8, H9, T9, H10, T10,\u2014have to be introduced. This\ncan be done by putting one cycle into each square along the next\n\" diagonal \" (from H8 to T8) and adding a single cycle, H10 T10 (see\nfigures in thick type in Table III. A). The cycle H10 T10 contains\n(a) one each of the sequences H10, T10 ; 1 (b) two each of the sequences\nH9, T9 (since the sequences, by definition, overlap one another) ; and\n(c) three each of the sequences H8, T8. We require, then, one more of\nthe sequences H8 and T8, which are to be found respectively in the\ncycles H8 T, H Ts. Similarly, there are 2\" different sequences of\nlength 7, which should, therefore, occur eight times each in the series ;\nhence H7 and T7 should occur eight times each. They occur four times\neach in the cycle H10 T10, and twice each in the cycles H8 T, H T8.\nTwo more occurrences each are required and are to be found in the\ncycles H7 T, H. T2, H T7, H2 T7. Similarly for all the shorter\nsequences.\nIt must be observed that the distribution shown in Table III. is\nnot the only possible arrangement satisfying the conditions of a Norm\nSeries of this length. Any arrangement will do by which, after first\ndistributing all the cycles whose norm number amounts to one or more,\none cycle, and one only, is added to each line and to each column of the\nTable, with the exception of the line beginning tf9 and t\/ie column\n1 It also contains one of all the sequences of length 10 which can be made out of\ncombinations of single runs of both alternatives, viz., H9 T, Hg T2.

(This exception has to be made, because, as already\nexplained, the necessary introduction of the sequences H10 and Tvi\ninvolves the introduction of all the required sequences of Hg and T9.)\nIt is not difficult for the reader to assure himself that this is the only\ndistribution which would ensure an equal number of H's and \"Fa in\nthe whole series. As soon as the position of the cycle in each line is\nfixed, it will be found that there are two alternative positions for the\ncycle in the line below, until the last line is reached, when only one\nposition is possible. This gives in general 2n_2 varieties of the Norm\nSeries 2n in distributing the (n \u2014 1) residual cycles which occur. There\nare two symmetrical ways of filling up the Table according to this\nrule, which are shown in Table III. (A) and (B).\nAll these results can be immediately generalised.\nSeries with more than two Alternative Events.\nA series with any number of alternative events may be analysed\ninto cycles on the same method as that used when there are only two\nalternatives, by taking one of the alternatives as the invariable first\nterm of the cycle and beginning a new cycle whenever this alternative\noccurs after any one of the other alternatives. Thus, supposing there\nare three alternatives, a, b, c, and we choose to begin the cycles\nwith a ; the series a c, a a b b, abbe, a e c c b b, a c c, a b c, would\nbe divided into the cycles shown by the commas. These cycles, like\nthose in a series with two alternatives (or, for that matter, with any\nnumber of alternatives) may consist of two events, or of any number\nof events more than two. But the cycles composed of one event\nfollowing the a or a's are of two different kinds, as this event may\nbe b or c ; those composed of two events following the a's are of\nfour different kinds, as the events may be 62, be, 0%, or c b ; those\ncomposed of three events following the a's are of eight different kinds,\nand so on.\nThe probability of each cycle depends, of course, on the num\nber of events in it, being the same for all cycles of the same\nlength, no matter what the events are. As before, any given cycle\ninvolves the occurrence of two more events than are comprised in\nitself, viz., a b or a c preceding it, and an a following it. Thus\nthe cycle a b implies either b a b a or c a b a. The probability\nof the cycle a b is therefore the sum of the probabilities of the\nsequences b a b a and c a b a. Since there are three alternative\nevents, the probability of each of these sequences of four events is\n1 2\nk-4 ; therefore the probability of the cycle a 6 is \u201e4. The probability\n\fxxxv.] On the Construction of Chance Series. 301\nof the cycle a c is of course the same.1 Similarly the cycle a b c\nimplies either babe a or cabca, the probability of each of which is\n^ ; therefore the probability of the cycle abc (or any other cycle of\n2\nthree events) is g=. It is obvious that the same method of reasoning\nipplies to the cycles of all the different lengths ; so that the probability\nof a cycle of r events (in a series with three alternatives) is gr + 2 , In-\nj, series with t alternatives, the probability of a specific cycle of length\n- is. then,\nAgain, every cycle, whatever its length may be, involves at its\nbeginning the occurrence of either b a or c a, the probability of each\nof which is so that the norm number of cycles in a series of x\nevents is %, of x.\nTable IV.\nb c h 6c c2 cb 63 b2c 6cj beb CS cb.2 cbc Total\nCycles.\nTotal\nEvents\na 18 18 6 6 6 6 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 76 208\n6 6 2 2 2 2 \u2014 20 68\n\u00ab3 2 2 - 4 16\n100 292\nSeries of 729 (=3\u00ab) events.\nThe Table shows only the cycles whose norm number amounts to one or more,\nomitting the \" residual cycles \" and corresponding \" residual events.\"\nIf we take a series of a definite number of events (choosing some\npower of 3 as the number, for convenience of calculation) and sum\nmarise the cycles in a Table (see Table IV.), we find as before that\nthere are some \"residual cycles,\" (not shown in this Table) the number\nof which always increases absolutely, but decreases relatively, with the\nlength of the series. The formula for this number is given below\n(see p. 307). These residual cycles can be distributed according to the\nrules of the Norm Series, the conditions to be fulfilled being that the\nsequences of the various lengths must occur in the series according to\n1 These being the shortest possible cycles, it follows that 31 is the shortest series\nin which the norm number of any cycle will amount to one.\n\f302 Alice Johnson and W.

The\nnarrative shows that Mr. Lane had apparently no reason for expect\ning the event.

He was surrounded\nby people engaged at the theatre, amongst whom were Miss Millward and\none of the footmen who attend the curtain, both of whom I actually saw a\nfew hours later at the death scene.

I forget now, and therefore do not attempt to repeat, the exact\nwords Mr. Lane used as to the reason (in the dream) why Mr. Terriss would\nnot appear that night, but I have a distinct recollection of him saying that he\n(Terriss) could not do so, because of his having dreamt that something had\n\fXXXV.] 311\nCoincidences.\nhappened. It was all passed over very lightly in the same spirit in which it\nwas given, i.e., in the spirit of unbelieving banter. . . .\nH. Carter Bligh.\nIn reply to further inquiries, Mr. Podmore received the following\nletter from Mr. S. Creagh Henry :\u2014\n5, Milborne Grove, The Boltons, S.W., January 20th.\nDear Sir,\u2014With reference to your letter concerning Mr. Lane's dream,\nhe mentioned it to me at rehearsal during the morning of the day which\nproved fatal to poor Terriss. The description he gave me was that he\nsaw Mr. Terriss on the staircase (upon the landing where he died) sur\nrounded by several people who were supporting him in what appeared to\nbe a fit.\nSomething serious seemed to have happened, and no performance took\nplace that evening, \u2014another fact which was verified. As far as I recollect\nthis was all Mr. Lane mentioned.\u2014I remain, yours faithfully,\nS. Creagh Henry.\nMr. Terriss, whose real name was William Charles James Lewin,\nwas murdered by a man named Richard Archer Prince (Archer being\napparently his family name and Prince his professional name), an\nactor out of employment, who was afterwards proved to be insane\nat the time.\nThe value of this case as evidence of supernormal perception of a\nfuture event of course depends primarily on whether Mr. Lane had any\nreason for anxiety on Mr. Terriss's behalf. The account of the murder\ngiven in the Times of the next day shows that Archer was known by\nsome persons to have a grudge against Mr. Terriss, but it seems clear\nthat very little attention was paid to this and that no one had any\nsuspicion of the length to which he was prepared to go. And the\nevidence given later seems to show that this account exaggerated the\nsuspicious incidents, in accordance with the common and natural\ntendency to imagine, after an event, that one has noticed some\nindications of it, if one did not actually expect the thing itself. The\nevidence further shows that, though Archer had expressed hostility\nto Terriss, he seems to have avoided doing so to persons in any way\nconnected with the Adelphi Theatre ; also that there were several\nother persons besides Terriss whom he had a grudge against, on account\nof their fancied ill-usage of him. Mr. Lane did not know him, except\nperhaps by sight, and had only heard of him as previously connected\nwith the theatre and that he had the night before asked for Terriss.\nTo this very common incident he could hardly be supposed to attach\nany importance.\nI do not think, therefore, that anxiety about Terriss could have\nhad any share in causing the dream ; but it seems desirable to give the\nY\n\f312 [part\nAlice Johnson.\nevidence for and against this view, and I therefore quote the account\nin the 'rimes of Friday, December 17th, and give an abstract of all the\nevidence given in the Times reports of the inquest, the examination\nbefore the magistrate, and the trial, which seems to me to have\nany bearing on the point. (See Time* of December 18th, 20th, 21st,\nand 30th, 1897, and January 14th, 1898).\nThe evidence shows further the close correspondence of the events\nof the death with Mr. Lane's dream.\nFrom the Times of Friday, December 17th, 1897.\nLast evening, Mr. William Terriss, one of the most popular actors on\nthe London stage, was assassinated at the private entrance to the Adelphi\nTheatre in Maiden Lane, Covent Garden. He had spent the afternoon with\nsome friends, and had gone home to dinner at about 5 o'clock. Sub\nsequently, he proceeded as usual to the theatre, where he was taking the\nchief part in Secret Service, and on reaching the private entrance he was.\nsuddenly attacked by a man between 30 and 40 years of age, who stabbed\nhim in the region of the heart and again in the back. The weapon employed\nis described as a long, thin-bladed knife. Mr. Terriss at once fell to the\nground, exclaiming : \" He has stabbed me, arrest him.\" The assassin, after\na struggle, was captured, and straightway conveyed to Bow Street Police-\nstation. Mr. Terriss, meanwhile, was carried inside the theatre and medical\naid was at once summoned from Charing Cross Hospital and obtained. It\nwas not possible, however, to convey him further than the foot of the\nstairs leading to his dressing-room, and here, after lying in a state of\nsemi-consciousness for about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, he\ndied. . . .\nThe assassin is known by the name of William Archer, or William Archer\nFlint. Some years ago he was employed as a supernumerary at the\nAdelphi, one of the pieces in which he appeared being In the Ranks. It is\nunderstood that he had frequently applied to Mr. Terriss and other members\nof the company for help, and a great deal had been done for him by them.\nRecently, however, ho had become so importunate in his demands that Mr.\nTerriss refused to do anything more for him, but referred him to the Actors\"\nBenevolent Fund, from which association he received a grant. For several\nnights past, Archer had been noticed hanging about the private entrance to\nthe theatre, and on Wednesday night, it is reported, he made an enquiry of\nthe stage-door keeper as to Mr. Terriss's whereabouts. He is said to have\nbeen known in the theatre as \" Mad Archer,\" but the stage-door keeper and\nothers last night expressed a doubt as to whether he is insane. ... In\nreply to the charge of murder, he is reported to have said : \" He has done\nme out of the Benevolent Fund this morning, and I am out of it for life.\"\nMr. Frederick Lane, who \" understudies \" Mr. Terriss in the part of\nCaptain Thorne, had a peculiar story to tell. He said :\u2014\n\"I dreamt about this very thing last night, and when I came to the\ntheatre this morning for the rehearsal, I told all the ' boys ' about it. I\ndreamt I saw Mr. Terriss lying in the landing, surrounded by a crowd, and\nthat he was raving. I seemed to seo it all and then it all seemed to fade\n\fXXXV.] 313\nCoincidence*.\nnway. It was a horrible dream, and T could not tell what it meant. I tried\nto forget it during the day, but to-night again, when I came to the theatre,\nI was going down Bedford Street, when something seemed to say, ' Do not\ngo there.' I then went round to Maiden Lane, and there I saw this villain.\nI had heard of him as being an old super, and I knew he was asking for Mr.\nTerriss last night. His appearance struck me as peculiar. He wore a big\ncloak and a slouch hat. I, however, do not know him, and he said nothing\nto me. I walked on, and then a few minutes afterwards I heard a great\nnoise and found that he had stabbed Mr. Terriss. I rushed back and saw\nMr. Terriss taken indoors. If it had not been for the police, I believe the\nman would have been lynched. He was a fellow of average height, had a\ndark moustache and a somewhat foreign appearance. I can suggest no\nmotive whatever for the crime. The man may possibly have been refused\nmoney. I cannot tell, though ; and it is at any rate certain he had no\nreason to go to such an awful extreme. Mr. Terriss was the kindest of men,\nand we loved him both on and off the stage. He was, indeed, ' one of\nthe best.' \"\nAnother member of the Adelphi company further corroborated the\nstatements previously made in reference to the personality of Mr. Terriss's\nassailant, mentioning that at the theatre he was generally known as \" Mad\nArcher.\" When seen by Mr. Nicholls on the previous evening and told that\nlie could not see Mr. Terriss, he is stated to have gone away murmuring\n',Not yet.\" . . . Archer is alleged to have nursed a grievance against\nMr. Terriss even before he left the employ of the Adelphi, and is reported\nto have more than once stood in the wings and made sarcastic remarks at\nthe expense of the deceased actor. One of his remarks is quoted as an\ninstance of this : \" Fools often succeed in life where men of genius fail.\"\nAbstract of Evidence Given in \"Times'\" Reports.\nMr. J. H. Graves said that he spent Thursday afternoon with Mr.\nTerriss and at about 7 o'clock drove with him to Adelphi Theatre\u2014driving to\ncorner of Maiden Lane, Strand, where they both alighted and walked to the\nprivate entrance a few yards up the lane. This entrance was only used by\nMr. Terriss and one or two others. As he was putting his key into the\nlock, the prisoner rushed forward from across the lane and stabbed him.\nMr. Terriss fell and Mr. Graves seized the prisoner and gave him in charge\nto a constable, whom he accompanied to Bow Street. He went back to the\ntheatre and found Mr. Terriss lying at the foot of the stairs a few paces\nfrom the door, attended by a doctor and several others. He died a few\nminutes later.\nThe prisoner said to him that Mr. Terriss had kept him out of employ\nment for ten years, and he had either to die in the streets or take his\nrevenge on him. The truth was that Mr. Terriss had often helped him and\nhad recommended him to the Actors' Benevolent Fund, from which he had\ngot help many times. He had called at the office of the fund on that day,\nand had been told that the Committee could not meet then to reconsider his\ncase. He had for some time been almost a weekly applicant there.\nSub-Divisional-Inspector William French waB at Bow Street when the\nprisoner was brought in and returned with Mr. Graves to Adelphi Theatre,\nY 2\n\f314 [part\nAlice Johnson.\nentered private door in Maiden Lane, and found Mr. Terriss lying in the\npassage. He was unconscious and remained so until his death. Three\ndoctors were present, and Miss Millward was supporting his head. She\nasked him if he knew her. He made no reply to her, but shouted out\nseveral times : \" Get away, get away.\"\nMr. Bragg, Police-Constable, who arrested the prisoner, said the latter\nhad been asked by Graves on the way to Bow Street why he did it, and he\nanswered : \" In revenge. He has blackmailed me for ten years. I gave\nhim due warning. I should either have had to die in the streets or have my\nrevenge.\"\nInspector Wood, before whom he was brought at Bow Street, said he\ngave same answer to him. To Inspector Croxton he said that his sister\nwas in league with Terriss in blackmailing him.\nAt the trial, Mr. Gill, the Counsel for the Crown, said there could be w>\nquestion but that the prisoner had some years ago conceived a violent hatred\nfor Mr. Terriss, and would appear to be under the impression that Mr.\nTerriss was in some way preventing him from getting on in his profession.\nThat was shown by statements made at different times to persons to whom\nhe complained that Mr. Terriss was preventing him from getting employment\nand was blackmailing him. As far as could be ascertained that was a\ncomplete delusion on his part ; Mr. Terriss had, on the contrary, assisted\nhim to obtain charitable relief and employment. The point at which the\nevidence commenced was in October last, when the prisoner came into\ncontact with Mr. Croydon, a theatrical manager at Newcastle. About the\nend of October he came to London and purchased a knife (probably the one\nwith which the murder was committed). It was during the period between\nthis time and the murder that he was getting assistance from the Actors'\nBenevolent Fund. On .November 'Jth he obtained a letter of recommenda\ntion to them from Terriss, on the strength of which he received various\nsmall sums from the fund.\nAfter being arrested, prisoner said to the Inspector about the knife.\n\" That is what I stabbed him with. He had due warning, and if he is dead,\nhe knows what he has to expect.\"\nIt was clear that he was acting with the greatest deliberation and that,\ncherishing a feeling of hatred against Mr. Terriss, he was uttering threats as\nto what he proposed to do. During the time he was in London at the end of\nOctober, he was obviously contemplating the crime, because they found him\npurchasing the knife and uttering the threats against Mr. Terriss.\nMr. R. Croydon, theatrical mauager, had engaged the prisoner in\nOctober last to take a part in his company at Newcastle. The prisoner told\nhim he had only left the Adelphi through one man, and might have starved\nbut for the Actors' Benevolent Fund, and that he would be even with thii,\nman some day. He did not learn his part and behaved very strangely, and\nconsequently was discharged next day. He said he had then two enemies,\nand on being asked who the other was, said it was Terriss. Mrs. Croydon\nsaid \"You are mad ; \" and he replied, \"Yes, and the world will ring with my\nmadness.\" Ho then left and they had not seen him again.\nMr. Denton, theatrical manager, of Maiden Lane, said he had known\nthe prisoner for some time, and had then lost sight of him till October or\n\fXXXv.] 315\nCoincidences.\nNovember last, when he called nearly every day at his office for employ\nment. He tried to get him employment and offered him a week's engage\nment, which he would not accept. On the afternoon of December 16th,\nprisoner called to ask if he had got him any employment and he said he had\nnot. Cross-examined, said the prisoner did not appear to have any particular\nanimosity against Mr. Terriss ; was peculiar, and could easily be put into a\ntemper by chaff\u2014he seemed to think he ought to play more important parts\nthan were given him.\nMr. Colson, Secretary to the Actors' Benevolent Fund, said that help\nhad been given to the prisoner on the recommendation of Terriss in his\nletter of November 9th. He read seven letters from the prisoner to the\nmanagers of the Fund asking for help, saying that he was in great trouble, on\naccount of having lost an engagement \"through no fault of my own,\" but not\ncomplaining of any one otherwise than in that phrase, and expressing great\ngratitude for what they had done for him.\nMrs. Darby, his landlady, had seen the knife in his room upon more\nthan one occasion before the murder, but she never saw him use it for\nanything. She had seen marks on it as if it had been used for cutting\nbread. She knew he was in trouble for want of money, as he could not pay\nhis rent.\nG. Lorbero, cutler, Brompton Road, said in October he had knives for\nsale similar to one produced, price 9d., and one evening in October, a tall,\n.shabbily-dressed man bought one. (Evidence at police-court made it almost\ncertain that this was the knife with which the murder was committed.)\nMr. Thomas Terriss, son of the deceased, said he never knew him to\nbe threatened at all, did not know he had an enemy in the world. \"He\nhad not to his knowledge ever seen the man who was charged with his\nmurder until he saw him at Bow Street on Friday morning, when he found\nhe was not a man whom he had previously known as ' Mad Archie.' \"\nHenry Si'rATT, stage door keeper to the Adelphi, said he first saw the\nprisoner about two months ago, when he brought a letter for Mr. Terriss to\nthe stage door and waited for an answer. Half an hour later a message came\ndown, \"All right.\" A few nights after this Mr. Terriss spoke to witness\nabout messages. Witness saw the prisoner about half a dozen times after\nthis. He would wait outside the door for half an hour or so and then\ngo away without saying anything, except on December 15th, which was\nthe last time witness saw him, when he asked if Mr. Terriss came out that\nway, meaning by the stage door. Witness replied that he did, which was not\nthe fact ; but he said it in consequence of what Mr. Terriss had said to him,\nin order to keep the man away from the private entrance in Maiden Lane.\nCross-examined, said it was not an uncommon thing for persons who had\nbeen employed at the theatre to wait about the stage door, nor was it an\nuncommon thing for persons to come there and enquire in regard to others.\nW. Ali;er, dresser to Mr. Terriss, said that he did not know the prisoner.\nOn the night of December 15th he saw the prisoner at about 8.30 watching\nthe people coming out of the stage door, but did not speak to him.\nThe Defence was directed towards proving insanity. Evidence was\ngiven that the prisoner had had many delusions of persecution, thought his\n\f316 Alice Johnson,\nmother and others had put poison into his food; that Mr. Arthur, the\n\" theatre-master \" at Dundee, \" blackmailed \" him. He had also worked as i\nlabourer and thought his fellow workmen and others had tried to keep him\nout of work, had violent fits of passion, thought his brother was in league\nwith Mr. Arthur in blackmailing him and had attacked his brother several\ntimes, once with a knife and poker. Two of his brothers had been iusane.\n-It. Beveridoe, attendant at the Dundee Theatre, gave evidence of his\nthinking himself a great actor and badly used in general. Once he wanted\nto \" go for \" an actor named Stewart, and when Beveridge turned him oat.\nprisoner pulled out a revolver from his pocket and threatened him.\nA. Husband, foreman at Wallace Foundry, in Dundee, said prisoner\nworked there in 1896 (in the intervals of his being employed as an actor),\nand said Mr. Terriss blackmailed him. He showed him a letter from\nTerriss saying that he should be glad to hear of his getting an engagement,\nand that he might give his name as a reference. The prisoner had asked\nMr. Terriss for a character, and he thought that letter not sufficient, and\ncalled it blackmailing. He said the same thing about Mr. Elliston, who, he\nsaid, was in league with Mr. Terriss.\nMr. Elliston, theatrical manager, who had employed prisoner, said\nsince prisoner had left him, he had received a number of letters and post\ncards from him stating that he had not given him a reference, that he had\nblackmailed him and tried to prevent his getting employment, which was\nnot true.\nDk. Bastian gave opinion that he was insane, and his mind saturated\nwith delusions of persecution. He did not attach any importance t.,\npurchase of knife ; did not think prisoner contemplated doing the murder a\nmonth before he did it. If he had premeditated it, he might have been\ninsane all the same, but he did not believe he had. Did not believe prisoner\nwent to theatre with intention of committing the act, but that he wanted to\nspeak to Mr. Terriss, and as Mr. Terriss did not speak to him, he struck\nhim, having the knife in his hand.\nTwo other medical experts gave very decided opinions as to his insanity,\nbut said nothing as to whether the act was premeditated or not.\nThe verdict given was to the effect that the prisoner was guilty of wilful\nmurder\u2014that he knew what he was doing and to whom he was doing it, but,\non the medical evidence, that he was not responsible for his actions.\n\fXXXv.] 317\nCoincidences.\nAPPENDIX III.\nSome Premonitory Dreams of Races.\nThe following narrative, which is of interest in connection with\nProfessor Haslam's dream of the winner of the New Zealand Cup (see\nabove, p. 250), was compiled by Mr. Donald Murray, Editor of the\nSydney Morning Herald, a Member of the Society.\nMelbourne Cup Dreams.\nThe race for the Melbourne Cup has acquired such celebrity in Australia\nthat it has come to be regarded as a national event. It attracts visitors from\nall parts of Australia, and for weeks beforehand the Melbourne Cup is one\nof the chief subjects of conversation over a continent as large as Europe.\nCuli Day is the culminating point of a saturnalia of gambling, the results of\nwhich penetrate to every corner of Australia. Under these circumstances it\nis not surprising that there is always a large crop of dreams of the Winner\nof the Cup. It is also not surprising that, as there are never more than\nabout 150 entries and seldom more than about 20 or 30 starters for the\nMelbourne Cup, and as the dreams must be numbered by thousands, one or\ntwo of the dreams occasionally come true. The odds are heavily in favour\nof such a contingency. As an illustration of the fact that racing dreams are\nfairly numerous in Australia, I encloso an extract from the Sunday Times of\nNovember 1st, 1896, a Sydney paper, in which mention is made of half-a-\ndozen Cup dreams. The Cup was run two days after the publication of these\ndreams, and it is notable that not in a single instance was either the first,\nsecond, or third horse correctly indicated. The extract, however, serves to\nshow how widespread is the tendency amongst sporting people to dream of\nthe Cup, and consequently the extreme probability of one or two of the\ndreams occasionally coming true by chance coincidence.\nAnother, and a very droll aspect of the matter was revealed to me by\nthe sporting editor of the Sydney Morning Herald. I asked him if he\nthought there was much betting on dreams of the Cup. \"Of course there\nis,\" he replied, \" why, some people make a practice of taking a heavy dinner\nof pork in order to dream of the winning horse.\" The same authority\ninformed me that entries for the Melbourne Cup took place about the second\nof June each year, and that the Cup is run in November, or about six\nmonths afterwards. Bets used to bo made as much as a year beforehand,\nbut long range speculation of this kind is not now practised to any extent.\nThe entries number from 100 to 150, and of these usually not more than\nfrom 30 to 40 horses actually take part in the race. The odds against some\nof the individual horses, rank outsiders, may be as long as 1,000 to 1, while\nthe chances against other horses may be as short as 5 to 1. On the average,\nhowever, the odds against any horse selected at random six months before\nhand would not be more than 150 to 1, and a few days before the race not\n\f318 Alice Johnson.\nmore than about 50 to 1. The names of the horses entered for the race are\npublished all over Australia for months previously, and there is consequently\nplenty of opportunity for the dreamers. If there were only 1,000 dreams\n(possibly there are 10,000) then the odds would be about 10 to 1 in favour of\nat least one dream coming true. For this reason\u2014because racing dreams\ncome so completely within the range of explanation by ordinary coincidence\n\u2014but little importance can be attached to such occurrences.\nOn at least two occasions, however, Cup dreams have occurred of such a\nremarkable character that they have received notice in the public press.\nOne of these I shall describe as the \" Auraria dream,\" and the other is the\nso-called \" Nimblefoot Mystery.\" The latter seems to have impressed the\npublic mind to such an extent that twenty years afterwards it was remem\nbered and used as a heading for a Cup dream paragraph. A passing\nacquaintance in a boarding-house was also able to tell me about it. I will\ndeal first with the \"Auraria dream.\"\nOn November 6th, 1895, the Evening Neics, a Sydney evening paper,\npublished [a] paragraph [about it, which, however] gave no clue for further\nenquiries, but the following paragraph from the Australian Star, another\nSydney evening paper, on November 9th, 1895, dealing with the same\nsubject, mentioned the name of Mr. J. Dalveen, from whom I obtained\nsome corroboration of the story :\u2014\n\"With the majority of sensible folk, dreams of the Melbourne Cup\nwinner are regarded in the light of a time-honoured joke. One instance,\nhowever, has come under our notice which it is impossible to accept other\nwise than as a truthful and remarkable occurrence. Some four months ago\na working man resident in Redfern had a remarkable dream in which he saw\nAuraria win the Melbourne Cup ; he also dreamt that before the Cup was\nrun he (the dreamer) died. So vivid was the impression that he backed\nAuraria to win \u00a3200\u2014the odds at that time were very long. He gave the\ntickets to his wife. At the time of the dream he was in his usual health,\nbut he took ill and died some weeks before the race was run. One part of\nthe dream coming true, the story was circulated among the neighbours,\nseveral of whom backed the horse. Our informant was among these. He\nput \u00a31 on the filly, with the result that he won \u00a3,50. He laid the wager\nwith Mr. J. Dalveen, who at the time laughed at the idea. But the laugh\nwas on the other side when settling time came, and the young man who\nbacked the dream fancy has now the bank deposit slip to show for his faith.\nNumbers of his friends also chaffed him about his superstitious fancy\u2014\nbefore the race. Now he is engaged in the pleasant pastime of asking them\nwhether their opinion is shaken. And the widow of the man who dreamt\nthe winner is the richer by \u00a3200. Truth is still stranger than fiction.\"\nI wrote to Mr. Dalveen, a bookmaker, asking him whether the paragraph\nwas true, and if so, whether he could supply me with the name of the gentle\nman who laid the wager with him, or better still the address of the widow of\nthe man who had had the dream. After some delay my letter was returned\nwith the following note written upon it by a Mr. J. W. M .\n\" Mr. Dalveen has handed me this letter of yours, as I took the bet of\n\u00a350 to 1 about Auraria from him. I spoke to the widow and she does not\nwish to have her name published in any paper about the sad affair. The\n\fXXXV.] 319\nCoincidences.\ndream was, sad to state, quite true in every detail. \u2014Yours faithfully, [signed\nin full] J. W. M . Don't publish my name.\"\nI wrote to Mr. M. explaining that I simply wanted more precise details.\nI got no reply. Finally I called on Mr. Dalveen and obtained Mr. M.'s\naddress. He was an employe1 of a clothing company in George-street,\nSydney. He assured me that the paragraph was perfectly true, and he\nadded :\u2014 \"When I heard of the death, I said to myself, 'Here's a leg in' .and\nI laid the wager.\" Mr. M. is a respectable young man, and the details of\nthe dream may, I think, be relied on as far as they go. He told me he must\ndecline to give me the address of the widow, as she had been worried so much\nby people calling to see her about the dream that he did not care to subject\nher to any further annoyance. I made some more attempts to find out the\naddress, but without success, and being very busy at the time I had to\nabandon the quest. It will be seen that there are certain features about\nthis dream which would have rendered more precise details very desirable.\nFor instance, the odds, as already explained, against the dreaming of the\nwinner of the Cup were not more than about 100 to 1. In the Star account\nthe date of the dream is given as \"some four months\" before the day of the\nrace, and the paragraph says, \"At the time of the dream he was in his usual\nhealth, but he became ill and died some weeks before the race was run.\"\nMuch would depend on the nature of the illness. At the time of the dream\nit is quite possible he may have known he had not much longer to live\u2014or\nhe may at least have had a subliminal consciousness of the fact, arising from\nunnoticed inroads of the malady, whatever it was. In that case the additional\ncoincidences of dreaming of his death before the Cup and of his widow\ndrawing the money, would not increase the probabilities against chance\ncoincidence. These incidents would be merely deductions from facts known\nto the subliminal mind. Unfortunately, as I was unable to obtain the\naddress of the widow, I was also unable to obtain the address of the doctor\nwho attended her husband.\nThe mention of the \"Nimblefoot Mystery\" in the heading to the\nEvening jVeirii paragraph led me to make enquiries about this case also. A\nboarding-house acquaintance told me it was most remarkable, that it had\ninvolved a \"bet on a double\" of \u00a320,000, and that there had been a big\nlawsuit about the payment of the bet after the death of the owner of\nNimblefoot. He also mentioned that it had been fully reported in the\n- 1 nstralasian, a well-known Melbourne weekly paper. I wrote to the\neditor asking him for the date, and the reply under the head of answers to\ncorrespondents was as follows :\u2014\n\" S.P.R. (Sydney). We do not remember any lawsuit about Nimblefoot.\nJ. Day, the lad who rode him in the Melbourne Cup, and W. Lang were\nparties in some action in which the question of Day's engagement to Lang\nwas concerned.\"\nThe boarding-house acquaintance then recommended me to write to the\nproprietor of Craig's Royal Hotel at Ballarat, and ask for the date of the\nAustralasian containing particulars of the Nimblefoot dream. I did so,\nand a reply came from Mr. W. L. Bentley, giving the date as October 31st,\n1891. On enquiry it turned out that there were no copies of the\nAustralasian of this date for sale, but the following is a copy of a\n\f320 [part\nAlice Johnson.\nparagraph it contains refeiring to the Nimblefoot dream. It occurs in the\nAustralasian of October 31st, 1891, page 865, in a sporting article by\n\"Augur,\" entitled \" A Cup Chronicle.\u2014Past and Present.\"\n\"While in 1870 Nimblefoot was victorious, and the alleged dream of his\ndead owner, Mr. Walter Craig, was said to have been realised. It will be\nremembered that by Nimblefoot's triumph the veteran bookmaker. Slack,\nhad been struck for a double which he had laid to Mr. Walter Craig ; but if I\nmistake not, the bet was in reality taken by Mr. Stephen Holgate in\nconjunction with Mr. Craig. It was \u00a31,000 to several drinks and cigars\nagainst Croydon winning the A. J. C. Metropolitan and Nimblefoot the\nMelbourne Cup. The double came off, and it was generally believed that\nSlack paid the \u00a31,000 to Mrs. Craig, but he gave her only half. It was ii\nsplendid advertisement for the rough old penciller, and ever afterwards he-\ndid a roaring business as a layer of double events.\"\n. . . In 1870 there were 29 competitors for the Cup. The Argus tip\nfor the Cup on the morning of November 10th was :\n1. Trump Card, 4 to 1 against.\n2. Croydon, 100 to 14 against.\n3. Nimblefoot or Strop, 100 to 7 against.\nThe Argus of Friday, November 11th, the day after the Cup, has a\naragraph as follows :\u2014\n\"A remarkable circumstance in connection with the victory of Nimblefoot\nformed matter for a good deal of comment and wonder yesterday ; that was\nthe fact that prior to his death Mr. Walter Craig had dreamed of a horse\ncarrying his colours, but with the jockey wearing crape, winning the Cup\nthis year. Differing from the great majority of prophetic dreams, this one\nwas on record prior to the event, and at the beginning of the week appeared\nin the following form in the Bendijo Independent :\u2014\n\" 'It is said that the late Mr. Walter Craig, of Ballarat, told some of hi*\nfriends a short time before his death that he had dreamed that he saw a\nhorse, ridden by a jockey wearing his well-known colours, but with crape on\nhis left sleeve, coming in first for the Melbourne Cup. Now Nimblefoot, Mr.\nCraig's horse, won the Hothara Stakes on Saturday, and his jockey, who\nwore crape on his sleeve in memory of the late Mr. Walter Craig, was loudly\ncheered on coming to scale. . . . Whether Nimblefoot will win the\nMelbourne Cup is another matter, but should that bo the case, it will be\nsomewhat startling.'\"\nIt will be noticed that nothing is said in this paragraph about the double\nevent bet, but apparently there was such a transaction, and that it was\nwidely known may be fairly inferred from the paragraph in the Australasian\nof 1891, or 11 years afterwards. It is, of course, impossible after so many\nyears to obtain any further corroboration of this case, beyond perhaps looking\nup the files of the Bendigo Independent to verify the foregoing paragraph.\nThat could be done, but it seems hardly necessary, as the Argns is recognised\nas a careful and accurato paper.\nDetails such as those about the jockey wearing crape on his sleeve, the\ndeath of the owner of Nimblefoot before the Cup, the betting on the double\n\fXXXV.] 321\nCoincidences.\nevent (if the accounts about the latter can be relied upon) seem to me to\nbring this case out of the ordinary ruck of Cup dreams.\nAs a further illustration of the likelihood of chance coincidence being the\ntrue explanation of ordinary Cup dreams, it may be mentioned that a few\nyears ago, when the last wave of spiritism, culminating in the exposure of\nMrs. Annie Mellon, passed over Sydney, several members of the New South\nWales Parliament held a table-tilting seance, and, taking a published list of\nthe entries for the Cup, tilted through the list for the winner. The table\npersistently bumped at one name, and this horse was backed by about a\ndozen prominent members of Parliament. The horse won the Cup, and as\nthe odds were fairly long, the members who laid the bets won sums ranging\nfrom \u00a310 to \u00a3100. The result was that for a time table-tilting as an adjunct\nto horse-racing became very popular in Sydney ; but the method was found\nto be unreliable, and racing speculators have been compelled to fall back on\npork suppers as a stimulant of supernormal faculty.\nDonald Murray.\n\f322 Alice Johnson.\nAPPENDIX IV.\nA Guessing Competition Case.\nThe following account refers to a success in a guessing competition\n,of one of the kinds now constantly being advertised in weekly papers.\nIt happens that a good deal of information is available about it, as it\nwas the subject of two trials, the proprietor of the paper having\nrefused to pay the prize money to the successful competitor, who\ntherefore brought an action against him. The jury gave a verdict for\nthe plaintiff, but this was disallowed by the Judge, on the ground\nthat the competition was a \"lottery\" (that is, a distribution, of\nprizes determined by lot or chance, and involving no skill) and there\nfore illegal. The judgment was appealed against, and the Court of\nAppeal determined that the competition was not a lottery. The\nquestion is important theoretically, as well as legally, and as my\nown view is that it was a lottery, I reprint all the arguments used\non both sides.\nThe case was first tried at the West Riding Assizes at Leeds, on\nMarch 22nd, 1898, and I give the report published in The Yorkik,rt\nPost of the following day in full, in order to show what evidence there\nis that the correct guess was really made.\nNISI PRIUS COURT.\n(Before Mr. Justice Lawrance and a Special Jury.)\nA CURIOUS GUESSING COMPETITION.\nA SHEFFIELD BUTCHER CLAIMS \u00a31,000.\nJohn Henry Hall, butcher, near Sheffield, brought an action for breach\n\u2022of contract against William Henry Bingham Cox, printer and publisher of a\npaper called the Rocket. The claim was for \u00a31,000, alleged to have been\nwon by the plaintiff in a guessing competition in December last. Mr.\nWalter Beverley appeared for the plaintiff, and the defendant was repre\nsented by Mr. Tindal Atkinson, Q.C., and Mr. Longstaffe.\nMr. Beverley, in opening the case, stated that Mr. Bingham Cox, in\ncopies of the paper of November last, had offered a prize of \u00a31,000 to any\none who should predict the exact number of male and female births, together\nwith the number of deaths in London for the week ending December 11,\n1897. There was also a number of consolation prizes offered for those who\nmight not predict the exact figures, but get very near to them. Hoping to\nbe the \u00a31,000 prize-winner, the plaintiff bought 252 copies. From these\n,copies he cut out the coupons, filled them up in the required manner, and\n.forwarded them to the offices of the Rocket. In one of these coupons,\n\fXXXV.] 323\nCoincidences.\naccording to counsel, he predicted that the number of male births for the\nweek ending December 11 in London would be :\u2014Males, 1,244 ; females,\n1,245 ; and deaths, 1,866. Plaintiff afterwards obtained from the Registrar-\nGeneral or from the Queen's Printers (Messrs. Eyre & Spottiswoode) the\nreturns of the male and female births and of deaths for the week in question,\nand it was alleged that the figures were precisely the same as those that had\nbeen forecast by the plaintiff. On the Kith December plaintiff wrote to the\nRocket office calling attention to the fact that he had been right in his\nforecast, and congratulating himself on his luck. To this letter there was\nno reply. He again wrote on the 29th December but got no reply. He\nwrote again on the 3rd January, and received as reply that when the result\nhad been arrived at, it would be made known in the Rocket. The plaintiff\nput the matter into the hands of his solicitor. In the course of further\ncorrespondence it was contended on behalf of the defendant that the com\npetition had been declared to be an illegal lottery, that he had been fined\n\u00a320, and that the coupon on which the plaintiff contended he had written\ntbe exact figures had got gummed or fastened to another coupon, and had\nconsequently been put to one side, and not deciphered. Even if these\nstatements were true, the defendant, counsel contended, had made them too\nlate to allow him to break away from his contract. The plaintiff, concluded\nMr. Beverley, had taken extraordinary pains to win the \u00a31,000, and having,\nas he thought, become entitled to it, he ought to succeed in this action.\nThe plaintiff gave evidence bearing out counsel's statement. During his\nevidence a kettle was brought into court with the object of separating two\ncoupons, one of which the plaintiff contended contained the figures entitling\nhim to the \u00a31,000 prize.\nThe Associate (Mr. Wade) held the papers over the kettle, and whilst the\nprocess lasted, the business of the Court was brought to a standstill.\nHis Lordship : I think this process might be carried on outside by two\nsolicitors. The first who sees anything favourable to his side can come\nrunning back. (Laughter.)\nThe kettle and documents were here taken out of court by the solicitors.\nAfter the supposed winning coupon was brought into court, it was passed\nup to the Judge, and the jury afterwards examined it.\nMr. Atkinson contended that it was impossible to make out what figures\nhad been on the coupon, and that in the space for the number of deaths\nthere never had been any figures filled in at all.\nPlaintiff, in cross-examination by Mr. Atkinson, said he had been obliged\nto file his petition through speculating on a stand on the occasion of the\nQueen's visit to Sheffield.\nMrs. Hall, wife of plaintiff, and a letter carrier also gave evidence for\nthe plaintiff.\nFor the defence, Mr. Atkinson submitted that the coupon in question\ndid not contain the necessary figures. The question, however, was one\nentirely for the jury. The defendant had carefully refrained from touching\nthe coupon that was glued to another, and which, according to the plaintiff,\ncontained the exact numbers. It could not be suggested that the defendant\nhad caused the coupons to be glued together. There was every indication\nof these coupons and others sent by the plaintiff having become glued\n\f:J24 Alice Johnson. [past\nLefore they left plaintiff's possession. Again, was it possible that any one\nwould be able to guess the exact number of male births, of female births,\nand of deaths in London in one week ? With regard to the letters of the\nplaintiff not being replied to, it was to be borne in mind that there had\nbeen thousands of coupons sent in for this competition, and that much time\nwas required to go through them.\nMr. Kennedy, assistant manager to Mr. Cox, gave evidence to show that\nthe coupons sis produced in court were the same as had been forwarded ui\nthe office. He had not glued them, uor had any one else in the office, nor\nhad any one tampered with the coupons in question or with any of them.\nMr. A. Allison, also in the employment of the defendant, spoke to the\ncare with which the coupons had been examined.\nMr. Bingham Cox, proprietor of the paper, gave evidence. The coupon\non which it was alleged the correct figures had been written was glued to\nanother when he first saw it. It was afterwards placed in the hands of his\nsolicitor, and had not left that gentleman's hands since. It was quit*\nuntrue that either himself or any one in his employment had tampered with\nthe coupons in any way whatever. There would be from 80,000 to 100,000\ncoupons.\nThe Judge, in his address to the jury, laid stress on the fact that it was\nfor the plaintiff to make out his caso.\nThe Jury retired to consider their verdict. On returning into court\n.,ifter half-an-hour's absence they gave a verdict for the plaintiff.\nMr. Beverley : I formally ask for judgment.\nMr. Atkinson, Q.C. : Before judgment is given, I shall have to argue\nthe point as to whether this competition was a lottery or not, and whether\nthe \u00a31,000 can be legally paid over.\nThe Judge : Very well ; that is clearly a point that must be argued. It\nmay be argued at the next sitting of the Court.\nJudgment was accordingly deferred until to-day (Wednesday), in order\nthat this point of law might be discussed.\nOn the following day the point was argued whether the competition\nwas a lottery or not. As this question is important, not only as a\npoint of law, but, as I have said, from a theoretical point of view,\nI again give the report in The Yorkshire Post (of March 24th, 1898)\nin full.\nMr. Atkinson, Q.C, who appeared for the defendant, addressing the\nJudge, now contended that although the jury had given a verdict for the\nplaintiff, judgment ought clearly to be given for the defendant, and that the\nplaintiff was not in a position to recover. That the competition was a\nlottery had already been decided, inasmuch as Mr. Cox had been fined \u00a320\nand costs in respect of the competition on which the present action was\nbased. A lottery had been described to be \"a distribution of prizes\ndetermined by lot or chance.\" This had been well illustrated in what had\ncome to be known as the \" Missing Word Competition \"\u2014Barclay v.\nPearson. In that case Mr. Justice Stirling, before whom it was tried, ruled\nthat if the competition had been one that involved the skill of finding out\n\fXXXV.] 325\nCoincidences.\nthe most appropriate word in a particular sentence, that would not have been\nn lottery, because there would have been an element of knowledge or skill.\nThe word in question was not necessarily the most appropriate one, but\nmerely a word which the publisher of the piper in question had himself\ndecided to be the word which was the most appropriate word. Mr. Justice\nStirling had held that under these circumstances it was necessarily a matter\nof chance that the word could be selected, and consequently no skill what\never entered into the competition. There was, said Mr. Atkinson, just as\nmuch of the element of chance in the present case as in the one known as\n\"the Missing Word Competition.\" The competitors in the present case\nwere to guess the number of male and female births, and the number of\n>leaths in a certain week. In such a calculation there could be no element\nof skill in arriving at the particular results. There wore he did not know\nhow many billions to one against any one arriving at the accurate figures.\nIn roulette, in spite of all its elements of chance, there was a certain margin\nof skill, although it might be almost infinitesimal. The case of horse-racing\ntipping might be drawn into the question before the Court. That case, how\never, as had been shown in Sagar v. Stoddart, was entirely different. There\nwas some knowledge on which the first, second and third horses in a race\nmight be prophesied. There the matter was to some extent a matter of\nexperience and knowledge. There were the performances of the horses and\nother matters tending to raise the prediction from the domain of mere\nchance. As he had said, however, the case of the Rocket was one of pure\nchance, and therefore came under the Lotteries Act. Being a lottery the\nplaintiff was not entitled to recover, and judgment should be entered for\nthe defendant.\nMr. Walter Beverley, who was counsel for the plaintiff, proceeded to\nargue in support of the verdict of the jury, and in refutation of the plea\nthat the competition was a lottery. In a lottery there was, he said, no\nopportunity given for the employment of any skill or judgment whatever.\nIt depended purely on chance, and no exercise of skill or knowledge entered\ninto it. The present case was entirely different, for the plaintiff had clearly\nshown that he had taken a considerable amount of trouble to obtain\ninformation to enable him to form a correct judgment.\nThe Judge : He could scarcely inquire at a house when a baby was\nlikely to be born. (Laughter.)\nMr. Beverley repeated that he had done much to obtain information to\nform a correct judgment, and if with the aid of such knowledge the plaintiff\nhad guessed the correct figures, he was entitled to win in the present\naction.\nThe Judge said the case before the Court was one full of difficulties.\nHe had not had an opportunity of looking into all the cases bearing on the\nsubject, but so far as he had formed an opinion, he was inclined to the belief\nthat there was more of the element of chance than of skill in the matter.\nThe case, however, was a very important one, and one on which there ought\nto be a definite pronouncement. He was going to give the judgment he\nintended in order that there might be another lottery, and that the plaintiff\nmight go to the lottery of the Court of Appeal if he wished, and try his\nluck there. (Laughter.)\n\f326 [PAKT\nAlice Johnson.\nMr. Atkinson : I take it there will be judgment for the defendant with\ncosts, with stay of execution.\nThe Judge : That is so ; and with a further stay of execution if necessary\nfor the appeal.\nThe judgment was appealed against, and the case was tried again\nbefore the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Judicature, Lord\nJustices A. L. Smith, Rigby and Collins on the bench, on December\n2nd, 1898.\nThe following report of the trial appeared in The Times of\nDecember 3rd.\nhall v. cox.\nThis was an appeal by the plaintiff from the judgment of Mr. Justice\nLawrance at the trial of the action, with a jury, at Leeds. The defendant\nadvertised in a paper called the Rocket that a prize of \u00a31,000 was offered for*\ncorrect prediction of the numbers of male and female births and the number\nof deaths in London during the week ended December 11, 1897; the com\npetitors to fill in and sign the accompanying voucher, paste it on a sheet of\npaper, and send it, with a coupon cut from the front page of the Rocket, in\naccordance with the instructions given. The voucher contained the following\nwords :\u2014\" 1 say that the number of births and the number of deaths in\nLondon during the week ending December 11, 1897, as disclosed by the\nRegistrar-General,s returns, will be .\" Then followed spaces for the\nnumber of births (male), births (female), and deaths. The answers were to\nbe sent in by December 10 ; and if more than one correct prediction was\nreceived, the \u00a31,000 would be divided. The advertisement also stated that,\n\"according to the Registrar General's returns, the number of births and the\nnumber of deaths in London during the week ending December 12,\nwere as follows :\u2014Births (males), 1,342 ; ditto (females), 1,213 ; deaths,\n1,539.\" The plaintiff, having sent in a correct prediction, brought this\naction to recover the \u00a31,000. The action was ordered to be tried without\npleadings under order 14. At the trial before Mr. Justice Lawrance, a!\nLeeds, the defence was that the answer had not been received ; but the jury\nfound that a correct answer had been sent in by the plaintiff, and gave a\nverdict for him for \u00a31,000. The learned Judge then, upon the application\nof the defendant, entered judgment, for him on the ground that the competi\ntion was a lottery. The learned Judge, in giving judgment, said that the\ncase was full of difficulty, and he had not an opportunity of looking at all\nthe cases bearing upon it, and he did not think he would be very much wiser\nif he did look at them. The foundation of a lottery was chance, and he\nshould have thought the foundation of guessing how many children would be\nborn next week or next month was a matter more of chance than of skill.\nOf course, with a verdict of \u00a31,000 in question, neither party would rest at\nthat Court : and the case seemed to be eminently one on which the Court of\nAppeal should give their opinion. For the purpose of sending it there he\nwould not take time to consider his judgment, but would hold that the\ncompetition was a lottery, and that the plaintiff might once more be put into\na lottery which might be as much a matter of chance as of skill\u2014go to the\nCourt above. He accordingly entered judgment for the defendant. Since\n\fXXXV.] 327\nCoincidences.\nthe trial the defendant had died. His personal representatives did not\nappear upon the appeal.\nMr. Brooke Little, for the plaintiff, contended that this was not a\ncompetition of mere chance, but some skill came into it\u2014namely, calculating\nfrom previous returns of the Registrar-General how many births and deaths\nwould be likely to take place in London in a particular week. It was not,\ntherefore, a lottery. He referred to \"Caminada v. Hulton\" (60 L.J., M.C.,\n116), \"Morris v. Blackman\" (2 H. and C., 912), \"Taylor v. Smetton \"\n(11 Q.B.D., 207). \"Barclay v. Pearson\" (1893, 2 Ch., 154), \"Stoddartv.\nSagar\" (1895, 2 Q.B., 474).\nThe Court allowed the appeal.\nLord Justice A. L. Smith said that, in his opinion, this was not a lottery.\nThe solution of the question did not depend upon mere chance. It depended\nvery largely upon chance, but there was an element of statistical inquiry\nbrought into it. The advertisement which offered the prize set out the\nnumber of births and deaths for the corresponding week of the preceding\nyear. A statistical calculation was imported into it, and it was not all\nchance. In \" Caminada v. Hulton,\" a Divisional Court, consisting of Mr.\nJustice Day and Mr. Justice Lawrance, held that an offer of prizes to any\npurchaser of a book who should fill up a coupon with the names of the\nwinning horses in certain races about to come off was not a lottery. How\nthe learned Judge reconciled his judgment in the present case with his\ndecision in that case he (the Lord Justice) did not quite understand.\nLord Justice Rigby and Lord Justice Collins concurred.\nIn reply to an inquiry made later in the same month, I was\ninformed that \" the Rocket and its late proprietor are both dead,\" so\nthat it seems very doubtful whether the prize money was ever paid.\nI have ascertained that the numbers of births and deaths quoted\nare the same as those given in the Registrar-General's Annual\nSummary of Births, etc., in London, for 1896 and 1897.\nThe question whether the competition was one of pure chance or\nwhether any skill entered into it is very complicated, and I venture\nto think that the arguments used by the Counsel and Judges betray\nsome obscurity of mind on the subject. There are, however, certain\nstatistics which it might be supposed would afford help in the guessing,\nand I give a few figures taken from the Annual Reports and Annual\nSummaries of the Registrar-General about those facts which seem to\nhave the most direct bearing on the question, and then proceed to\nconsider what inferences may be drawn from them.\n(1) The Marriage Rate (i.e., number of persons married per thousand of\nthe population).\u2014This has been steadily rising in the whole of England and\nWales during the last ten years, the rate of 1896 being higher than it had\nbeen any year since 1876. In 1896 it was 15,8, the average of the ten\nprevious years being 14,9. In London the same rise was observable ; and\nthe rate was also higher, being 18,0 in 1896, while the average of the ten\nprevious years was 17 ,2.\nz\n\f32S [part\nAlice Johnson.\nIt would not of course necessarily follow that the births were more\nnumerous, as the birth rate might be decreasing at the same time, which in\nfact has been the case. Still, if the marriage rate rises in any year, we\nshould rather expect t'> find the birth rate rising in the following year.\nInvestigation of the rates of each year from 1847 to 1896 bears this\nout to some slight extent ; in 24 cases the birth rate of one year increases\nor diminishes according as the marriage rate of the preceding year increases\nor diminishes ; while in 23 cases no such influence is discernible. Taking\nthe rates, however, in periods of 5 years, from 1841 to 1895, there are\n7 cases in which the birth rate increases or diminishes in accordance with\nthe marriage rate of the preceding period, and only 3 cases in which it\ndoes not.\nThere would therefore be some slight presumption that the births in\n1897 would be rather more numerous than they were in 1896. (As a\nmatter of fact, they were in London 215 less in 1897 than in 1896.)\n(2) The Birth Rate (number of births per thousand of the population). \u2014\nThe birth rate has been steadily decreasing since 1876, the rate of 1896\nbeing 29-7 in England and Wales and 30\"2 in London, while the average of\nthe ten preceding years was respectively 31 \"0 and 31 \"6. In 1897 the rate in\nLondon was the lowest on record, viz., 30 0.\nThe proportion of male to female births (counted as births of males tu\n1,000 females) has been decreasing since 1840 in the whole country. Taking\nperiods of five years, it was at its highest, viz., 1,052, in 1841-5, and\ndecreased steadily to 1,036 in 1886-90, remaining the same in 1891-5. The\naverage of all the periods recorded is 1,042. In London, however, the pro\nportion was 1,048 in 1896, whereas the average of the ten preceding years\nwas the same as that in the whole country, viz., 1,036. But the proportion\nin London fell again in 1897.\n(3) The Death Rate (number of deaths per 1,000 of the population).\u2014\nThe death rate has also been steadily decreasing on the whole since the\nperiod 1846 50, when it was 23 3. In 1896 it was 17 1 in England and\nWales and 18-2 in London, while during the preceding 10 years it was\nrespectively 18 8 and 19,9.\nThere is another general consideration with regard to all three rates,\nviz., their variation at different times of the year. The Registrar-General's\nTable giving the rates during the different quarters of the year since 1840\nin periods of ten years shows that\n(a) The Marriage Rate was always highest during the last quarter of the\nyear and lowest in the first quarter.\n(6) The Birth Rate was nearly always highest during the first quarter,\nthough in 1891-6 it was slightly higher in the second quarter than in the\nfirst. It was always lowest in the last quarter.\n(c) The Death Rate was always highest in the first quarter and lowest in\nthe third.\nNow, speaking generally, all these facts help to limit somewhat the\nranges within which the numbers required to be guessed will probably\n, lie. But they are really of very little practical use, because, in such\n\fXXXV.] 329\nCoincidences.\nshort periods as weeks, the numbers vary very much more in pro\nportion than they do for longer periods.\nThe only practical plan, then, is to find the actual range of the\nvariations that have occurred during a large number of weeks, and\nmake enough guesses to cover all the possible combinations of numbers\nwithin the range, \u2014or, better still, a little beyond it.\nThe following Table gives under each heading the highest and lowest\nnumbers recorded in any week of the two years 1896 and 1897.\nDeaths.\nIn 1896. Maximum , s\nBirths.\nMinimum 3041\n1829\nTotal. Male. Female.\n1563\n904\n1478\n925\n2146\n1238\nDifference 1212 659 553 908\n460 1427\n1027\n2360\n1158\nIn 1897. Maximum\nMinimum 2928\n2106\n1519\n1059\nDifference 822 400 1202\nIt will be seen that in 1896 there is a greater range of variation in all\nthe numbers of births, while the range of variation in deaths is greater\nin 1897.\nWith regard to the proportion of male to female births, the extreme\nlimits in any week were as follows :\u2014\nIn 1896, greatest excess of male over female births, 183, greatest excess\nof female over male, 52 ; total range of variation, 235. In 1897, greatest\nexcess of male over female births, 131, greatest excess of female over male,\n65 ; total range of variation, 196.\nDuring the weeks of 1896, the female births exceeded the male in 6\ncases ; during 1897, in 7 cases.\nThese variations, however, are much more than covered by the differ\nences between the maxima and minima in the Table. Supposing that the\nlatter represent the greatest ranges that can occur, the chance of getting all\nthe three numbers (male and female births and deaths) right in a single\nguess is one in 438,770,108 (the product of the three greatest differences,\n659, 553 and 1204).\nSince the successful competitor made only 252 guesses, it was extremely\nunlikely that he should have got one of them right ; while the chance\nagainst some one of the total 100,000 guesses said to have been sent in\nbeing correct (assuming that the guesses were all different, which they\nprobably were not) was about 5,000 to one.\nThese considerations seem to me to show that no more real skill\ncan enter into such a competition than into the guessing of numbers in\na lottery. If the ranges of the numbers in the lottery were known\u2014\nz 2\n\f330 Alice Johnson. [pakt\nas they probably are in some cases\u2014it would be easy to calculate how\nmany guesses must be made to ensure one being right, and the most\nignonant person would know that the more guesses he made, the\ngreater would be his chance of getting one right. Similarly the\nprevious statistics of births and deaths can only tell us what the\ngeneral trend of things has been so far ; that is, they afford rational\nground for expectation that the numbers will lie within certain limits,\nbut no rational ground for expecting any particular numbers within\nthese limits.\nOn the other hand, in the case cited by the Judge as a parallel\none\u2014that of guessing the name of the horse that will win in a race\n\u2014the kind of knowledge from which some particular inference may\nreasonably be drawn is available, and there is consequently scope for\nskill. It appears to me, therefore, that the two cases are not really\nanalogous.\n\fXXXV.] 331\nApparitions in Wed Africa.\nSUPPLEMENT.\ni.\nTHE FORMS OF APPARITIONS IN WEST AFRICA.\nBy Mary H. Kingsley.\nGentlemen and Ladies,\u2014I have accepted with much hesitation\nthe honour of addressing the Society for Psychical Research, for I\nknow the object of this society is the determination of the truth\nregarding apparitions ; whether they have a separate existence apart\nfrom their human seers and so on. With this branch of the study of\napparitions I have no concern ;\u2014all I am interested in is the discovery\nof the ideas that the natives of West Africa have concerning appari\ntions ; what position they have in West African native religion ; and\nwhat the West African holds to be their significance and their\ncharacteristics.\nBriefly, I entirely believe the West African sees apparitions, but I\ndo not think this any evidence that the apparition has a separate\nexistence. I have had an extensive and sad experience with people,\n\u2014white and black, strong-minded and weak-minded, educated and\nuneducated,\u2014suffering from delirium, which has taught me that men,\nunder certain physical conditions, can and do see things that men in a\nnormal state cannot and do not see. I also know that the African, in\nspite of all his hard-headed common sense, is endowed with a super\nsensitive nervous organisation \u2014he is always a step nearer delirium, in\na medical sense, than an Englishman ; a disease that will by a rise of\nbodily temperature merely give an Englishman a headache will give\nan African delirium and its visions. Whether this indicates a differ\nence in physical make between Africans and Englishmen, I do not\nknow. It may be that the African, by his long process of acclimatisa\ntion to malarial districts, has a chronic state of malarial delirium ; or,\non the other hand, it may be that his undoubtedly more sensitive\nnervous system enables him to see things the duller-nerved English\nman does not ; or, as one might say, the African mind may be a more\nperfect photographic plate on which the spirit world can print itself.\n\f332 Mary H. Kingsley. [Supplement-\nI do not know one way or the other ; all I am concerned in is that I\nshould give you as clear and unbiassed an idea as lies in my power of\nthe spirit world as an African sees it.\nFirst, therefore, I would like to state what the spirit world h\nthat the African sees and believes in. All the world is a spirit workl\nto him\u2014he has not, as many Europeans have, a feeling that there are\ntwo distinct worlds, a world of spirit and a world of matter ; neither\nhas he the idea that there is certainly a world of matter, and there\nmay be, or there may not be, a world of spirit ; the thing is one to him\nfrom the highest to the lowest. From the supreme Godhead to the\npebble on the seashore, it is merely a matter of grade.\nI beg you will allow me to detain you a few minutes with the\nstatement of what any one man, woman, or child is to an African\nwho has not been influenced by a Semitic Religion\u2014Christianity or\nMohammedanism. To the pure pagan African what we call a man is\nnot an individual one soul,\u2014he is a syndicate of souls, usually four,\ndetails of which I have given elsewhere. Well, this syndicate wear\nflesh and blood, and they wear clothes, require and like ornaments\nand food, exercise functions, and use tools, and so on, presided over\nby the soul syndicate. But the soul syndicate has other business to\ndeal with besides that of these things it lives in and directly lives\nby ; it also deals with other soul syndicates called men, with other\nnon-human souls of equal power to its own, with other souls of\nlower power to its own, and with other souls of greater power than\nits own, in grades of power right away up from dust to the Godhead\nwho is above all things that are. You may notice I am dodging\ncrediting the African with holding the idea of this over-god being\nthe Creator. This interesting point is not yet worked out. I my\nself at present regard creation-myths, which abound in Africa, as\nbeing the resultants of European and Mahommedan teaching. The\nnative African, as far as I know, has not the same feeling about\ntime that we have ; he does not see why things should come to an\nend, or have a beginning ; he recognises that they change, but I do\nnot think he would commit himself further. I cannot, however,\ndetain you with these, to me, interesting points in African philosophy,\nbut return to the position of the human soul\u2014the syndicate of dream\nsoul, shadow soul, bush soul, and surviving soul. This syndicate\ndeals most intimately with those souls most nearly connected with\nits interests, but it knows of the souls beyond, upper and lower, in\nultimate power. I do not think I should be going too far if I were\nto say you will find in West Africa no people who have not the\nconception of the idea of the supreme Godhead at the apex of things,\nand matter, the very lowest form of soul, at the other end of the\nscale ; or to put it in other words, you will find no people who have\n\fPart XXXV.] 333\nApparitions in 'Went Africa.\nthe European conception of matter at all. There is to them no\nconception of the difference between these things, but an infinitely\nintricate conception of degree, and herein is the secret of the terror\nof Africans for what are to Europeans material objects. The thing\nis perfectly clear in itself, but it is complicated by the fact that an\nAfrican can conceive a powerful spirit wearing a silk cotton tree, a\nrock, a fierce river rapid, or the everlasting, booming, man-killing\nsurf itself, as a garment. The African sees the spirit inside that\ngarment ; he no more worships, or fears the garment than you would\nfear, or worship a great man's chimney-pot hat, or pocket handker\nchief, or pen, and when he chooses to think the spirit that he fears\nor worships has cast these things off, has done with them, the\nAfrican also has done with them, and if it is necessary to him, tries\nto find out the spirit he wants to get on with in its new clothes ;\nwith this difference, mind you, and it is an important one,\u2014the\nAfrican, regarding such things as clothes as being in a measure\npossessed of life and responsibility, is liable to think that the thing\nwas cast off because it was bad and unsatisfactory to the spirit who\nonce used it as a garment, and this explains a certain quantity\u2014\nbut not all,\u2014of the cases in which an African smashes and\nvilifies his idol ; the other cases in which he does this arise from\nhis feeling the spirit itself has behaved unfairly to him, a fine\ninstance of which has been given in Mr. Dennett's Folk-Lora oj the\nFjurtes, published by the Folk-Lore Society \u2014you will find it in the\nchapter on the Burial of the Fjorte. The far more common thing,\nhowever, is the absolute carelessness as to what becomes of the\ngarment of the spirit, the thing that was the idol or the charm.\nThe spirit has thrown it off, it can itself be thrown away, or left to\nrot, it does not matter ; though it is not matter as you conceive it, it\nis in itself merely too low a grade of spirit to be worth troubling\nabout. The African thinks no more of it than you think of a\nharmless insect, or any other inferior living thing. I apologise for\ndetaining you on this point, but until you have grasped this position\nyou cannot understand the African's mind, and its attitude towards\napparitions ; it is a position you cannot avoid grasping when you\nlive among Africans who ate unadulterated. The result of this point\nof view is intricate, complex, and so on, but it is never for one single\nmoment confused.\nI will now turn to the forms of apparitions of the various grades\nof spirits, and we will commence with those of the great over-god you\nfind among all the West African peoples under varying names. This\ngod has no organised worship given to him, he is regarded as an\nunmanageable being, who has no interest in human affairs in detail,\nbut who now and then manifests an interest in, what one might call,\n\f334 [Supplement.\nMary H. Kingsley.\nthe higher politics ; he can interfere and save, or scourge a people, but\nit is no use for any gentleman or lady who has lost property, or got a\ndisease, to appeal to him. As far as I know the Krumen call on this\nover-god of gods more frequently than other West Africans. When the\nsurf on the shore of their country is very bad, and the men cannot get\nout fishing, they will go in numbers to the beach and talk to the great\ngod about it ; most carefully explaining to him the whole of the circum\nstances of the case,\u2014how the women and children want food, and food\ndepends on fishing, and so on, just as if they were addressing a great\njudge who had no personal knowledge of human affairs, but who could\nbe depended on to be just if you could only get him to be interested\nand to understand. Sometimes it takes a week to get the great god to\nunderstand, but he always does in the end, and the surf becomes pass\nable, for a time at any rate. Also among the noble tribes of the Bight\nof Panavia you find a regular talking to the great god, and among them\nyou find his apparition in some way connected with the moon ; at each\nnew moon the chief of a village goes out and stands alone in the open\nand talks to Anyambie. He does not praise Anyambie ; he does not\nrequest him to interfere in human affairs ; he, the chief, feels competent\nto deal with them, but he does want Anyambie to attend to those\nspirits which he, the god, can control better than a man, and he always\nopens the address to the great god with a catalogue of his, the chiefs,\nvirtues, saying : \" I am the father of my people ; I am a just man : I\ndeal well with all men,\" etc. The chief s account of his own virtues\nis naturally too long to detain you with here, and after this he winds\nup with a request that all spirits may be kept away from his village.\nAt first hearing these catalogues of the chief's virtues used to strikf\nme as comic, and I once said : \u2022' Why don't you get some one else Ui\nsay that for you ; praising yourself in that barefaced way must be\nvery trying to you.\" \" Oh, no,\" said the chief, \" and, besides, no ma:i\nknows how good he is except himself,\" which is a common West Coast\nproverb. But by-and bye\u2014when I had been the silent spectator of\nseveral of these talks with the great god \u2014 the thing struck me as\nreally very grand. There was the great man standing up alone,\nconscious of the weight of responsibility on him of the lives and\nhappiness of his people, talking calmly, proudly, respectfully to the\ngreat god who he knew ruled the spirit world. It was like a great\ndiplomat talking to another great diplomat of a foreign power, saying,\n\" Let us keep our people from interfering with each other ; \" there\nwas no whining or begging in it, and as I have said, the grandeur of\nthe thing charmed me. But you must not think I am one of the\nmodern school who believe that great over-gods are always moral gods\nin a human sense, because the African over-god is not. I have often\nasked carefully, \"Is he good?\" and I never found an African who had\n\f:Part XXXV.] 335\nApparitions in West Africa.\nnot been in touch with mission influence say Nzambi, Nyankupong,\nor whatever other name he was called by, was good. He is a thing\napart from the human moral code. No ! they say firmly, he is not\nwhat you would call good ; he lets things go too much, he cares about\nhimself only, and I have heard him called \" lazy too much, bad person\nfor business,\" and a dozen things of that kind, and very rarely do you\n\u2022come across any one who speaks of an apparition of him. You will\nfind in the Folk-Lore of the Fjortes an account of a man who\nwent aloft and had a chat with him, but this is not a common\ntale, and, I think, shows mission influence. The most frequent form\nof apparition spoken of as appertaining to this great god is some\ntremendous elemental catastrophe : he rides upon the whirlwind and\nthe pestilence.\nI think I may say all the various names given to the over-god can\nbear the translation of the Awakener, the Lord of the sky. I think\nthis great over-god is just merely a realisation of the fact that there\nis something outside and beyond the earth we know and the sky we\nsee to the African mind. It seems that this thing can also include\nterrestrial things. I myself, therefore, completely accept Dr. Sneider's\nstatements that the African is a monotheist ; but a dissertation by\nme, the diffuse, on a German philosopher, also diffuse, is not a thing\nsuited for an evening's address ; it would be more of the nature of\na Chinese play that takes a week or so to get acted, so I turn\nto the apparition of the gods below the over-god, but above the\ngrade of power of man.\nThe apparitions of these gods are very frequent ; you will hardly\nfind a man or woman who does not know a man or woman who has\nseen them, while the priests belonging to their various cults are always\nin ready touch with them,\u2014on terms of easy familiarity. Sometimes\nthe god takes possession of the priest or priestess, talking through him\nor her, but always with a strange voice. This occurs when the priest\nhas to arrange an affair between the god and the laity when the laity\nare present, but at other times the priest when he is out alone meets\nthe god in a visible form, and you often hear a priest say, \" I met \u2014\nwhatever the name of his god may be\u2014this afternoon,\" in the most\ncasual way, and when asked after the god's state of temper, the\nimportant thing about a deity to the laity, the priest will say, \" Oh,\npretty fair,\" or, \"rather bad,\" or \"much as usual,\" and will advise\nany one who wants to do business with him to seize the opportunity of\nthe state of amiability, or to leave any little affair until a more hopeful\ntime. Down below the Negro districts you very rarely find these\ngods with a regular priesthood ; there they are dealt with by the\nheadmen of the villages, and at Emfetta when one night there was a\n.row on, a headman, one of the parties involved in the discussion,\n\fMary H. Kingdey. [Sappleroeut.\nroaring like a bull with rage, spun round and charged at a steep dwaif\ncliff to make a short cut to the residence of his village god above ;\nwhen he was half way up, the bit of cliff came away with him, and\nflump on his back our friend landed on the beach below. There was a\ngeneral grunt, and the man picked himself up and returned to the\ndiscussion in a more reasonable frame of mind, recognising it was m>\ngood expecting spiritual support that evening, and that he had only\ngot himself to depend on. You will find in Ellis's works many de\nscriptions of the form of these gods when they appear ; you will find\ntheir apparitions are almost all of human shape, that their appearance\nis almost always gigantic and terrifying, and that some of them are\nmales, some females ; frequently they are married, and strangely\nenough, many of the worse gods are white.\nThere is a certain amount of reason in some of them being white.\nFohsu is monstrous in size and whitish in colour, but that may be\nbecause of her association with salt making. That most horrible Aynfwa\nwho lives at Moree, whose name signifies \u2022' not to be looked upon,,\nand whose priests say she is covered with white hair like a goat, being\nthe protectress of Albinoes, also has a reason for being white, though\nwhy she should be hairy I do not know. But why Ihturi, the god or\nthe rivers, iSirwi and Kakum, on the Gold Coast, should be white there\nseems no reason ; any more than there is for Bons'ahm, the swallower\nof men and a marine god, being exceedingly black like Fuan Fuan-Fo,\ndriver of men and war-god of Moree ; while Auipah, the good person,\nwho appears always with a casting net in his hands, being attached t,>\nthe fishing industry, is brown in colour ; while\u2014to make this question\nof colour more difficult \u2014Bobowissi, blower of clouds, chief god of\nthe Southern Tshi, is as black as night, and Tando, chief god of\nthe Northern Tshi\u2014the Hater\u2014the god to whom driver ants are\nsacred, is a sort of golden brown. There is, I am convinced, some\nstrange stuff involved in this question of colour. I do not believe\nwhiteness has anything to do with white men, for people who have\nno direct intercourse or experience of white men have white gods,\nand if you enquire if these white gods are like white men, you will be\ntold, no, they are white like chalk, not like white flesh. You will also\nfind a feeling of veneration for chalk, it is used in ceremonial decora\ntions ; a gentleman engaged in some particularly important fetish\naffair paints a ring with white chalk round one eye : when you have\nhad a stroke of luck, people say, God has thrown chalk to you, and so\nforth. I should incline to the belief that this whiteness had a connection\nwith the rarity ot the colour in West Africa as a colour at large, and\nalso with its occurring in connection with those two important things\u2014\nso valuable and so dangerous respectively \u2014namely, salt and the surf\nthat unceasingly breaks on West Africa's seashore.\n\fPart xxxv.] Apparitions in West Africa. 337\nI will now leave this class of gods, whom Ellis has so admirably\ndescribed in his works on the Ewe Tshi and Yoruba-speaking peoples\nof West Africa, merely remarking that they have a characteristic in\ncommon with their representative forms further south down the coast,\nand that is that it is a dreadful thing for any one but a priest belonging\nto them to -see an apparition of any one of them. To the layman\nseeing one of these gods means death in the Bight of Benin, and in\nthe Bight of Biafra it means disaster to the tribe to which the layman\nseer belongs.\nI need not detain you here with details of the apparition form of\nthat god and goddess to whom I have given most especial attention,\nSasabonsum and his wife Srahmantin, for I have published observa\ntions on them already. These two deities have a great fascination for\nme, they are so widely diffused, so powerful, so unlike those local\ndeities I have named, and they are equally unlike the great over-god\nand the lower range of spirits equal to and inferior to man. They are\nthe rulers of the witchcraft world ; hated by priests and respectable\nhouse fathers from one end of West Africa to the other, and feared\nexceedingly. No man dare openly brag of having had dealings with\nSasabonsum ; to see him is to die ; to be touched by him is to rot ; but\nif you are very brave and bad, and want a power from him, you risk\nthis and go into the forest, try and gain from him a power, a suhman ;\nif he grants your request for one, you do not see him, nor feel him, you\nhear him. If he refuses, there is a vacancy in your family circle, and\nit may be fragments of your remains are some day come across in the\nforest in a very scattered state; or merely a few rags of your garments\nare found sticking to the trunk of one of Sasabonsum's silk-cotton\ntrees ; and then your family and friends say that while you were going\nto see a sick friend, the awful thing grabbed hold of you and took you\nto his under-world home to suck your blood at his leisure (Sasabonsum\nnever eats flesh) and your enemies say you were in that forest for no\ngood, you were making witch, and there is a row, and actions for libel\nand trials by ordeal break up the peace of your town for months after.\nI fear I have detained you too long already in my attempt to place\nbefore you the thing that in the African mind is behind the mere\nthing seen, this great, very-real-to-the-African spirit world. When\npeople up here see a ghost, I find it is usually a ghost of a departed\nhuman being, or the vision of a Saint or Angel. Out there the\nmajority of ghosts seen are not human at all ; a very high percentage\ndo not take human forms. One of the most important of the Fjorte\ngods is Nkala the Crab, who comes now and then from his kingdom\nunder the sea ; and lower in power, but very terrible, are the ghosts\nthat are flying spears, ghosts that are paths leading men to destruc\ntion, ghosts that are blood ; in fact, there is nothing we know that\n\f338 [Supplement\nMary H. Kingsley.\ncannot be to an African an apparition, the cloth of a spirit, and just as\na learned African man can put on to his spirit the form of a leopard\nor a crocodile, so can a great spirit put on the form of man, beast,\nstorm, pestilence or thing.\nTando the Hater comes among people he has a grudge against in\nthe form of a weeping miserable orphan child, and woe to those who\ntake that child in, for he gives them a disease that they give their\nneighbours, and all die of. Nzambi, of the Fjorte country, comes\namong people as a woman carrying a child, and begs for food or drink\nfor it, and woe to those who refuse her. The contradictory conduct of\nthese two gods is not isolated\u2014many gods do that sort of thing\u2014and\nit makes the human being very careful how he deals with strangers.\nThere is an immense amount of very curious stuff connected with what\none might call the natural history of African apparitions. I should\nmuch like to know whether any other apparitions are divided\u2014like the\nWest African ones\u2014into those whose disappearances leave ash, or leave\na common object like a fallen bough, or a pool of water, and those\nwho leave no sign behind them at all. These apparitions that leave no\nash are the most dreaded.\nI fear I have neglected too much to-night the legitimate ghost, the\nhuman soul out of a body, but I have said all I can say on Ensisa and\nAszahmanfo ; but tiresome as they are and on occasion dangerous,\nthey are not to be compared in danger with the gods\u2014the Imbuiri or\nlocal deities, or Sasabonsum. Human souls, if properly buried and\nlooked after, are manageable beings, commonly called the well-disposed\nones, but no one would dream of regarding a local deity as a\nperson as easily managed as an ancestor ; while a Sasabonsum with\nhis temper well up is the most awful and unmanageable thing West\nAfrica knows. But, besides apparitions of dead human beings, there\nare apparitions of live ones. You will hear many stories of people who\nhave been belated at night on a journey, coming to a village, and after\ndark finding heaps of people in the village merry-making ; and seeing\nthat none of them wore clothes, knew they were witches, and, hiding\nthemselves, have spent an awful night, for if the witches had found\nthem out, they would have torn them to shreds. These stories are\nvery cheery when you hear them at a bush fire in the heart of a\nforest, whose local geography ycu know little of in detail, and they\nare told in most dramatic convincing fashion, and the witches in the\ntale always keep on leaving off dancing and saying \" I smell live flesh,'\nand go hunting round for that live flesh, which is you. It recalls ones\nearly terrors of Fee-fo-fum vividly, and you wonder if you may not\nyourself some night stray into a witch town. Then you will hear\nstory after story of people who have been alone on the path, women\nand children chiefly, who have been seized and carried away by th\u00ab\n\fPart XXXV.] 339\nA2yparitions in West Africa.\nbibendi and kept by them in their town, may be for years, or until\nthey have had sense and opportunity to get a handful of red pepper\nand seizing a favourable opportunity, throw it in the faces of the\nguardians of the gate, and flee for it hard all back to real life. I\ncame across a very pathetic affair connected with this at Adenolo'ongo :\na couple had lost a child, it had strayed away and been no more seen,\nbut they heard it sometimes crying at night, and they said \" the\nbibendi have got it,\" and they used to go out and search for it,\ncalling it by its pet names. There are, in fact, endless tales of\nthe bibendi and their ways and their towns and their markets,\nwhereunto by day live people sometimes unintentionally go, and buy\nat the market-place goods that vanish before they reach their own\nhomes, or goods that turn into horrible useless things. I may remark\nfor the benefit of any one who is going to the land where such things\nare, that if you get among spirits, never touch the food they offer you,\nor you will have to stay with them for a long time, and never give\nthem your clothes in exchange for finer raiment, for if you do you\nwill alarm your relations by coming in without a rag on you, and, as\na man said to me, \" One's wife never believes when one says one's\ncloth has been given to a bibendi man. She always thinks it is living\nwomen who have got it.\" And if you deliberately go to a spirit town\nto find out something from them, never drink water, or anything else,\nuntil you get home ; if you do you will forget what the spirits told\nyou. These bibendi are the souls of dead human beings, and Mr.\nI)u Chaillu got himself more discredit up here than he need have by\nrepeating the tales he had heard about the bibendi and their towns,\nand crediting them to gorillas,\u2014I expect from a confusion in the\nnative words.\nAlthough throughout all West Africa there is, as Merolla says,\n\" an exceeding plentie of Devils,\" there are some places where they\nare so numerous as to make the place almost uninhabitable to the\nhuman being, used as he is to their goings on and manners and\ncustoms. Of course I, being out there for the purpose of studying\nFetish, have always had, when I heard of such a region on good\nauthority, to go and potter quietly into it. I am not a person who\nwould violate any man's temple or sanctuary, but miscellaneous devils\ndo not count in that category ; the greatest difficulty you experience\nin getting into these devil haunts is getting respectable people to go\nwith you. This, however, you can do without, provided there is even\na small resident human population therein. Your friends among\nthe surrounding tribes will, it is true, tell you the men who\nlive in such places are little better than the devils, but that may\nbe just prejudice : at any rate my personal experience among the\nhuman residents in the notorious devil regions of the Sierra Del\n\f34.0 [Suppleiatm.\nMary H. Kingsley.\nCrystal and the Ourounougou swamp has been exceedingly\npleasant and friendly, and although I, according to local opinion,\nhave suffered grave inconvenience from the devil population upsetting\nmy canoe, making me lose my way, and on one awful occasion grabbing\na box of most valuable fishes, that by natural laws ought to have\nfloated on the water after an upset in a swamp but did not,\u2014these ai>\nnot things to discourage an enthusiastic observer of the ways of\ndevils, but rather stimulating than otherwise. Well, the straws\nthing about these particular devil haunts is that the people who lh>\nin them hold the same opinion about their spirit co-residents that thf\noutside world does, and they simply glory in the richness in horrors of\ntheir homes ; nothing, indeed, pleases a Nkama or Ourounougou man\nmore than when on one of his visits to a town on the border of his\nregion, he succeeds in making the flesh crawl of every man and\nwoman in it. Round among the villages by Lamberenie, a little\nexperience soon taught one that a night of excursions, and alarms,\nand shrieks, meant that one of those swamp men had been up telling\ntales and disorganising the nervous systems of the respectable Ajumba\nand Igalwa population, and when I was down in the swamp myself\nstaying with the swamp men, the local conversation was just a'\nalarming and lurid, but being used to that sort of thing it did not\nupset people so much. I well remember, the first night I spent at\none of their little islands, asking why there were no window holes is\ntheir houses like there were in the Ajumba and Igalwa houses : and\nbeing told quietly that the fewer holes a house had down there the\nbetter, because things looked in through them. Then followed a\ncatalogue of things that had been seen through holes : one large eye\noccupying a hole all night, a horrid but complete face, a red-hot plaU-\nof metal (a neptune, as those plates are called), a hand hanging out\nthe sill that, when you cut at it with a knife, bled and bled but\ndid not go away, and had no body belonging to it, and so on ; and I\ngathered that, when my friends came down to occupy these houses on\nthe islands in the swamp for the fishing season, they had for the\nfirst week, until things were tidied up, a very lively time of it, and I\nam bound to say that when things were tidied up and quite all right,\nfrom my host's point of view, the time, to one not brought up to\nthat sort of thing, remained lively. I do not think I have ever seen a\nweirder scene anywhere than I saw nightly at full moon from the door\nof my perched up little pigeon-house on one of those low clay island*\nnamed Njuki ; there was clear water right round it, some 200\nyards across, and then rose up the black forest wall a hundred\nfeet high, so dense that neither sun nor moon could illuminate it\nThe black shadow of the forest wall would cloak the water and be\nwithdrawn off it as the moon rays struck it, like drawing a velvet\n\fPart XXXV ] 34,1\nApparitions in West Africa.\ncloth off a bright silver table ; and in moonlight and in darkness\nshone the light of the fireflies ; while the beach below and up under\nthe house was in the possession of crocodiles, squattering about as\ngracefully as swans upon a gravel walk, quite different things to the\nsleepy log-like things crocodiles are by day, save that they stank just\nas bad. But they were now in their clumsy way active and noisy,\ngiving their quaint bark that ends in a moaning whine, and evidently\ngenerally enjoying themselves, and making you understand why the\nnatives went to bed early, and built their houses on the tops of poles,\nbut poles not quite high enough or strong enough, to my way of\nthinking. Now and again the great black mass of a hippo would raise\nitself out of the water, and come ashore and have a look round, or\njust give a great soughing grunt of satisfaction and sink again, and\nduring the early hours of the night there would be strange wandering\nwefts of silver and white mist that trod the water solemnly, gracefully,\nand now and then waltzed together into one mass that would sink into\nthe lake, or stroll away and stand showing white in the darkness, or\nglide away among the tall columns of the forest wall ; it was a scene\nto make one believe in ghosts, and see them, if you could see a ghost at\nall. I cannot,\u2014never have,\u2014but my African friends can and do to\nany extent, in tamer surroundings than the Ourounougou country,\nwhich I have never dared attempt to describe, which haunts me and\ncalls me more than any other thing I have ever seen. Then there is\nanother region I love well, but where all spirits are not bad, \u2014 though\nmost of them are,\u2014-the region of the rapids of the river Ogowe ; there\nfrom Boue and Lope down to Otala Amagonga are the fearful spirits of\nthe rapids and the Okanda gorge, ever quarrelling with each other, and\nwith the rocks and with the whirlpools in between ; ever ready to kill\nthe man who comes near them ; but there are other spirits there who\nare kinder to him and who call him off from danger, and these are the\nsinging sands of Okanda. There are, as I have elsewhere described,\nbeautiful sand-banks of white sand, that owing to the fall of tempera\nture at night, emit a long faint musical note, which you can hear\nthrough the noisy squabble and roar of the rapids, if you keep your\nhead bowed low near the surface of the water as you toil up or flash\nclown the Okanda in a canoe at night, and you know that there is\nslack water where the sound comes from, and keep into it. Naturally\nthe Adooma canoe men who work the regions of the rapids feel a\ngratitude to these spirits and give them things, and I confess I got used\nto giving them things when with the native canoe men, and use grows\non one there, and I had to pull myself up one night and say to myself,\n\" Look here, you don't believe in these things,\" for coming down alone\nthat night I found myself flinging tobacco to the spirits of the singing\nsands. This passive growing into a belief in fetish is a thing liable to\n\f342 Mary H. Kingsley.\nhappen to one when one lives among such scenes and surrounded by\npeople who so simply and so thoroughly do believe in fetish, and yoe\nwill hardly find a white man who has lived long alone in West Africa\nwho does not think there may be something in fetish. I fell more\nrapidly into the fetish line of thought than a trader or official would,\nbecause my mind was carefully kept swept of preconceived notions, and\nI was profoundly interested in the thing and anxious to follow it\nthrough all its varied twinings and turnings. A little practice, &\ngreat deal of patience and sympathy with the African, which he\ncompletely won from me by his kindness to me, soon taught me to\nthink fetish, and when you once think fetish, it is so easy,\u2014the outside\nworld and circumstance are so readily explained by it, \u2014that you find\nit difficult\u2014it requires an effort \u2014 to think in any other way. You ali\nknow up here people who have a great knowledge of French 1 Well\nthey always, when there is anything particular to be said, use a French\nphrase. I use a fetish phrase\u2014that is all.\nYou will often hear this religion of fetish called a religion of\nterror and painted black with crimson patches. Well, facts are facts :\nfind me a more cheerful set of human beings in this wide world than\nthe West Africans who believe in fetish ; find me a region where\ncrime for private greed is so rare as in AVest Africa, and then, and not\ntill then, will I say fetish is a horrible thing. I will grant you there\nis human sacrifice under it from Sierra Leone to the Niger ; I will\ngrant you there is a sending down with the dead of their wives,\nslaves, and friends ; I will grant you it kills witches, that it produces\ncannibalism in this region ; but before you write down the men who do\nthese things as fiends, I ask you to read any respectable book on\nEuropean history, to face the Inquisition and the fires of Smithfield,\nand then to go and read your London Sunday newspapers. West\nAfrica could not keep a Sunday newspaper going in crimes between\nman and man ; its crimes are those arising from a simple direct\nabsolute belief in a religion. From no region that I know can so truly\ngo up the sad cry to God, Doch, alles was dazu mich trieb, Gott, war so\ngut ! ach ! war so lieb ! as from West Africa. Down below the Niger\nyou strike two schools of fetish who do not care so much for religion\nin a religious sense. I do not care so much for the Bantu negro, and\nthe true Bantu you meet below Cameroons, as for the true Negro.\nI like them, but the Negro is an infinitely finer man, physically and\nmorally, than the Bantu; so the mere fact of the Bantu doing little or\nnothing in the way of human sacrifice or sending-down killing, does\nnot make me prefer him to the Negro. But to both alike everything\nis an apparition, and what matters about an apparition is its grade of\npower.\n\fPart XXXV.] 343\nOccultism in Went Africa.\nII.\nA FEW NOTES ON OCCULTISM IN WEST AFRICA.\nBy J. Shepley Part, M.D.\nLate Assistant Colonial to the Gold Coast Colony.\nWhen I first went to Africa, few men probably were more sceptical on\nsuch subjects as clairvoyance, apparitions and the so-called supernatural\ngenerally ; I had of course heard the popular smatterings of these\nthings and when I did, had, in the usual style, put all down to fiction,\nover-excited brain, suggestion or auto-suggestion and the like. I hope to\nadvance in what follows some evidence that phenomena do at times occur\nthat are not explainable by ordinary scientific methods and that certain\nmen can avail themselves of forces which are beyond the ken of the\nordinary individual. It is certain that when I was first brought into con\ntact with these things I was incredulous, and, as a consequence, put them\non one side for a considerable time as not worth investigation\u2014much to my\nsubsequent regret.\nI propose to roughly divide the paper into divisions, as stories T have\nheard and facts observed, but under the former heading I only propose to\ninclude those stories which, unless otherwise stated, I believe to be worthy\nof credence from personal knowledge of the men who told them.\nI do not intend always to mention my authorities by name, as in some\ncases I am under obligations not to do so, and in others it would possibly be\ndistasteful to them did I do so, and, owing to the short time at my disposal,\nI am unable to ask for their permission.\nThere are many tales told by natives of the haunting of roads by the\nspirits of the deceased, but of these I do not purpose to treat, not having\nhad means of investigating ; but when travelling in the interior I have\nrepeatedly been told of what the English-speaking native of the uneducated\nclasses calls, for want probably of a better word, ghosts, i.e , of messengers\nhaving been seen on the approaches to villages and so on, and we are told\nthat these \" ghosts \" are men who go out to keep a look out on the road to\ngive timely warning of the approach of strangers. This matter will be dealt\nwith later on in more detail.\nIn cemeteries the presence of apparitions is looked upon by the native as\ndie usual thing, and these are said to be the spirits of the departed buried\nthere. They make their appearance as usual at night and take various\nforms, sometimes appearing as replicas of their once living selves, either\nmaterial or in ghostly form\u2014more often in an undefined (more or less)\nghostly or cloudy condition, luminous or otherwise, as the case may be.\nThese forms are looked upon with fear by the ordinary people and it is\nconsidered dangerous to come into personal conflict with them at times\u2014\nthis idea leading occasionally to blackmailing by personators ; it is also\n2 A\n\f344 [Supplement\nShepley Part,\nthought to be very wrong to grapple with a genuine ghost, as it may probably\ninjure him (or it) greatly, though, as to why, I have not been able to gain\nany enlightenment. These stories of graveyards I have quoted in outline\nhere as showing the general drift of ideas on the subject, and certainly I\nhave had luminous appearances in the form of an apparent nebulous mass\nof light pointed out to me in these situations as being what are described as\nghosts of the dead.\nMany of the old castles and ports teem with accounts of ghosts of old\nofficials haunting them at times ; of these I propose to give one or two in\noutline as given to me by men whom I believe to be absolutely trustworthy,\nEnglishmen holding administrative and judicial appointments.\nAt one port is a very fine old castle, built, I believe, by the Portuguese\nabout the seventeenth century, still used as temporary quarters for officials\ntravelling through or visiting the place. On one occasion a district commis\nsioner went to the place on official business and arrived after dark. lit\nproceeded to change and during this time his boys prepared the table for\ndinner in the hall, and on his going out of his room to have a walk round,\nhis boy met him and said, \" a white man come for chop, sar, 1 tell cook get\nchop for two.\" My informant said this was nonsense\u2014where was the white\nman ? and went into the hall, on which the boys said \" he sit for table \" hi\nthe commissioner's place, and pointed to the head of the table, apparently\nastonished that my friend did not see him, but they stuck to it he was there,\nand, on being asked what he was like, described a man with a pointed grey\nbeard and moustache, dressed in Spanish or Portuguese style of the last\ncentury. My friend said he could see nothing whatever, but he was quite\nsatisfied that several of his boys did see the man and they were unanimous\nin their descriptions of him. Furthermore they refused to stop in the castle\nat night, and preferred to camp out where they could.\nThe gentleman who told me this I knew well, and am aware that he wa>\na thoroughly hard-headed reliable man, who was not given to romancing, and\nas entirely free from superstition as any one I ever met. Of the facts I am\nsatisfied\u2014explanations I must leave to others.\nWhile passing through one of the outposts, I was informed of an extra\nordinary case of murder. The crime was seen to be committed by competent\nand credible witnesses at a place some 80 miles from the coast\u2014some five\ndays' marching\u2014but equally credible witnesses, including white evidence,\nvouched for the man's presence on the coast on the same day and at the time\nof the murder. The interest in this case lies in the fact that the accused\nwas a known witch doctor (not fetich man) of no mean ability.\nWith regard to the transmission of intelligence by occult means, the\nmatter is treated by the better classes of natives as everyday knowledge, the\nmedicine men occasionally being asked to obtain or transmit information for\nvarious purposes.\nI have repeatedly been told by well-educated and broad-minded natives\n(and such do exist) that it is possible for certain trained individuals to\n\" project their consciousness\" to a distance irrespective of time or distance,\nand to do so while retaining a continuity of consciousness with that in their\nordinary condition. We also hear the same fact stated in this way : That\nthe individual has the power to go to any place without regard to time or\n\fPart XXXV.] 345\nOccultism in West Africa.\ndistance, etc., and it is not an uncommon remark to hear that so-and-so\nhad been to such-and-such a place \"during the night,\" or\" yesterday\nafternoon,\" or \"this morning,\" such journey being out of all possibility by\nordinary means.\nIn respect to the transmission of articles, such as letters, from place to\nplace, the accounts are fewer, but more precise, if anything, than those of the\nmere transmission of intelligence or the obtaining of information by personal\nobservation of the seer ; but very few seem to be possessed of this power,\nand only a few seemed to me to be acquainted with its existence, and it was\nalways spoken of as being rare ; but on one occasion a witch doctor under\ntook to do this for me, but, owing to peremptory orders to change my\nstation at short notice, I was unable to put this to the test.\nI feel that I must depart from my general rule and mention one name\namong my informants, that of the late Mr. Ferguson, who was murdered by\nSamory's (or Samoli's) men at Wa, in Dagati, whilst engaged as a member of\nthe expedition under Lieut. Henderson, R.N., in 1897, to which party I had\nalso the honour to be attached. I do this in consequence of Miss Kingsley's\nhaving already quoted him at the meeting of the Society on the 10th inst.,\nwhen I had the pleasure to be a guest. Miss Kingsley stated then that Mr.\nFerguson claimed to have the power of projecting his intelligence (I use this\nas a convenient and non-committing phrase) to a distance and making\npersonal observations. Now I know that he did make this claim, and I\npropose to relate an incident here which goes far in my mind to substantiate\nit. When we had \"sat down\" at Wa for some time, and were anxiously\nwaiting for reinforcements and renewed supplies, we were exercised much in\nour mind as to what had become of the relief column, as it was considerably\noverdue, and Mr. Ferguson undertook to try and find out its whereabouts.\nHe did so, and reported that he had discovered an armed party travelling\nfrom East to West through a certain district which had better be nameless.\nHe said that this party had but one white man with it, whereas we knew that\nthe one we expected should have had three. He also said that he did not know\nthem, although he was acquainted with two of the expected officers, neither\ncould he recognise the uniforms of the men. Now the point here is that the\nplace where this party was reported was many miles east from the route to\nbe followed by our relief party, and their direction of march was at right\nangles to what our party would have followed. Further, there was no column\nof which we had been advised anywhere near this place. The sequel appeared\nupwards of two months after this, subsequent to the evacuation of Wa, when\nwe had joined a second British column under Captain Donald Stuart, then in\ncommand of the Hinterland forces. On our leaving him to proceed to the\ncoast, he gave instructions to us to enquire at a certain town into the truth\nof a native rumour which had just reached him of a party belonging to\nanother nationality having passed from East to West through that town\nabout two and a-half months previously. It can easily bo imagined how\ninterested I was thereat.\nWhen we reached the town named in our orders we found that\nundoubtedly their party had passed as described, and answered in every\nparticular to Mr. Ferguson's description given three months before, and at a\ndistance of some 130 miles.\n2 A 2\n\f346 [Supplement.\n\/. Shepley Part.\nNow this incident occurred under circumstances, as it happened, that-\nprecluded any possibility of personal communication with Mr. Ferguson by\nany one without my knowledge, as the whole time the whole of Mr.\nFerguson's tent was in my view, backed by a high swish wall. There was\nno transmission by water, as he had no stream there, and drums are not\nused by the Soudanese tribes in the West to anything like the extent\nthey are by the pure negro tribes on the coast belt, and, in addition,\nMr. Ferguson was not a drummer or a king's linguist. They are\nhereditary posts, and indeed his native rank was superior to them, high\nas they stand.\nOn the way up to the Hinterland, shortly before leaving the forest country,\nwe were benighted one night, and our guide did not know how far we were\nfrom the town to which we were bound. We had been marching for some\nhours in the dark along one of the forest roads when I and others saw what\nwe took to be a lantern in the thick bush. It was peculiar, as it moved as\nfast as we did. It presently came out on the track, and an attempt was\nmade to capture the bearer, which failed, and Mr. Ferguson said we had\nbetter leave it alone. The impression that I retain of it is as a focus of\nlight throwing a circle of light round it, much as an ordinary stable lantern\nwould, but afterwards I could not say that I actually saw the wires of the\nlantern, but that was the general impression.\nAs we approached, the light eluded us, and then followed the path ahead\nof us for some few miles, and then disappeared, just outside the town we\nwere approaching ; it moved exactly as if carried by a man. The explana\ntion given to me was that this was the \"double \" (or \" Ka \" of the ancient\nEgyptians) sent out along the route to act as our guide.\nTowards the end of the last Ashantee expedition I happened to be\nstationed on the coast at the termination of the shortest route from Kumassi\nto the coast. A day before the expected entry of the expedition into\nKumassi, I was informed by my boy that the Governor had entered the\ntown at noon (this was about 1.30). About an hour later I was told the\nsame thing in the town by an old chief, an educated man, who, when I\nlaughed at it, remarked that native means of communication were much\nmore rapid than ours.\nI may mention that the upper portion of the line was in charge of the\nRoyal Engineers, and the coast lines under reserve for Government wires\nonly. The news was confirmed the following evening by official wire. The\nhead of the military wire was some 30 to 36 hours' distance from Kumassi,\nso this excludes irresponsible chattering by the operators. As to runners,\nwe were five days at the shortest for special runners from the front. The\nroute is entirely through forest country, and, in regard to water transit of\nsound from drums, there is no direct access to the coast from Kumassi by\nwater.\nWith regard to the means by which these phenomena are obtained\u2014these\nare secret, and their professors are members of a secret society ; but I was\ninformed on good authority that the process gone through to obtain the\npower of clairvoyance as exemplified above is purely physical, and requires\u2014\nwhen the means have been taught\u2014but constant practice to bring the\nseveral stages to perfection, but that special means are used in each stage.\n\frart XXXV.] 347\nOccultutm in West Africa.\ninitiation being necessary to each stago of development and then only on\napproval of the chiefs of the order, which is very stringently guarded.

The paying of \" Astral visits \" or projection of the consciousness\nonly.\n3. The same as 2, with power to materialise the entity projected or\n(which I am not certain) to transport the body itself and to\naffect material objects.\nMr. Ferguson's name having been mentioned in public in connection\nwith this subject, I should like in justice to him to say something as to his\ncharacter as I knew it.\nI found him to be a most modest and retiring man with regard to those\nsubjects, and not inclined to talk about even the possession of the power of\nclairvoyance, which he treated as a great honour to have, and as a sacred\ntrust not to be reposed in any one who came along. He was a well educated\nman and a most competent surveyor and mathematician, as can be verified by\nthe honours obtained for work done in the field from the R.G.S. I may add\nthat I have myself the utmost confidence in what he said to me on the subject\nof this paper, and I have not trespassed on any confidence shown me, as I\nhave confined myself to those points which are common knowledge among\nmany on the coast, and which Mr. Ferguson was willing to confirm.\nIn conclusion I can only reiterate that, as to ways and means in detail, I\nam in the dark, and should be pleased to correspond with any one in the\nposition to enlighten me.\nAs to any criticism not dealt with in the paper, I shall be glad to give any\nfurther information in my power to any one addressing me through the\nEditor, who has my address.\n\f348 [Supplement,\nF. C. S. Schiller.\nin.\nPSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHICAL RESEARCH:\nA Reply to Professor Miinsterberg.1\nBy F. C. S. Schiller.\nBoss locntua est: Professor Hugo Miinsterberg, of Harvard University, the\nlord of I don't know how many thousand dollars' worth of psychological\nmachinery, has planted the banner of the ' only genuine ' psychology amid\nthe pulverised fragments of ' Mysticism, ' and sent back ' the Cinderella\nof the sciences,' Psychical Research, to supervise what alone she is fit for,\nviz., the culinary operations of the witches' caldron. And yet, perhaps, in\na critical age, such ex cathedra pronouncements, even of the greatest\nscientific dignitaries, are not as safe nor as effective as the lofty and scornful\nsilence affected by most of his confreres on the General Staff of the Army of\nScience. The Goliath of Authority cannot stalk forth into the field of\ndebate without a risk that a little pellet of reason may pierce through the\nthickness of his skull and put an end to his pretensions. For too often the\neffect of authority is impaired by argument, and the impressiveness of a\njudgment is destroyed by divulging the reasons on which it was based.\nProfessor Miinsterberg should have remembered Lord Mansfield's advice to\nthe man who undertook the job of judging what he did not understand, or,\nas one must say in Professor Miinsterberg's case, what he wonbi not under\nstand. For Professor Miinsterberg's inability to grasp the nature of the\nease for Psychical Research is manifestly of an emotional rather than of an\nintellectual character, and affords as fine an example of the effect on the\nmind of a passionate ' will to disbelieve ' as I have had the pleasure of\nmeeting. I am accordingly confident of expressing only the sentiment of\nevery psychical researcher when I thank Professor Miinsterberg for the\ninteresting light he has (however inadvertently) thrown on the psychology\nof psychologists, and the nature of the fixed ideas by which they seem to be\nobsessed.\nAnd, personally, I owe Professor Miinsterberg a debt of gratitude also\non account of the undesigned, exquisite, and almost ideal illustration which\nhis remarks yield of the aptness of a comparison I ventured to institute in\nreviewing Mr. Podmore's book in the pages of Mind,2 when I called\n'psychical' phenomena \"the Dreyfus Case of Science.\" I then pointed\nout that they had never received a fair and open trial, coram popido, that\n1 Of. his article on \"Psychology and Mysticism\" in the Atlantic Monthly,\nJanuary, 1899.\n3 For January, 1899.

In short, it was finals o]ioiov that\namong the Anti-Dreyfusards of Science there should so soon be found a\nchampion to emulate the career of M. Cavaignac I Once more, therefore,\nlet me express my gratitude for the service he has done to the cause of\nPsychical Research.\nNevertheless, gratitude must not prevent us from exposing the extra\nordinary nature of the misrepresentations and misconceptions to which he\nhas attempted to give currency, from drawing attention to the weird\ncharacter of the arguments whereby he seeks to appease his intellectual\nconscience, in his hurried return to the shelter of the ancient prejudices\nfrom which he ought never to have emerged.\nI.\nProfessor Miinsterberg does well to open his article with a definition of\nhis subject : but, unfortunately, this definition would be scouted as\nridiculous by every psychical researcher. He defines ' mysticism ' 2 as \" the\nbelief in supernatural connections in the physical and psychical worlds.\"\nAssuredly he did not discover this, or anything like it, in the Proceedinys of\nthe Society for Psychical Research, which he professes to have included\namong the 100 volumes he claims to have read\u2014(p. 78)\u2014with more speed,\napparently, than care. In fact, if he had paid the most ordinary attention\n1 Professor Miinsterberg, of course, trots out this old bugaboo also. Courageous\nconfidence in the ability cf science to deal with every order of fact\u2014with \"the\npsychology of spirits, angels, and demons, if such things there be, as well as with\nthat of men and beasts \" (as I said in Mind), he declares to be \" wrong and dangerous\nfrom beginning to end \" (p. 76). Can it be that he has a lurking fear that if he\nattempted to investigate demons, they might fly away with him?\n2 Which term, by the way, he uses in a wholly popular and unphilosophic fashion,\nin order to include under a common name widely divergent attitudes towards these\nmatters.\n\f350 [Supplement.\nF. G. 8. Schiller.\nto the continually reiterated 'declared objects of the Society,' he could\nnot but have observed that no more grotesquely inappropriate travesty of\nits object and method could possibly have been devised. The notion that\nany phenomenon in God's world could be meant to be supernatural, i.e., put\nthere to provoke and to baffle inquiry, is one of the very worst of the super-\nstititions which the Society for Psychical Research set out to slay. Its\nfundamental postulate was that no fact could possibly be supernatural, that\nhowever anomalous it might appear, it must yet admit of investigation by\nthe appropriate methods, and that to declare it supernatural was simply .in\nobscure and offensive way of declaring one's unwillingness to have it inves\ntigated. From the psychical researcher's point of view, therefore. Professor\nMiinsterberg is himself a supernaturalist of the worst type, little better than\nthe advocate of the Satanical explanation. The very term \"supernatural\"\nis eschewed by the Society for Psychical Research, and ever since its\nfoundation it has striven to supplant the ' supernatural ' by the ' super\nnormal,' aiming at the momentous consequence of substituting something\nwhich courts and challenges, for something which discourages and denes,\ninquiry. Either, therefore, Professor Miinsterberg has wholly mistaken\nthe purpose of the psychical researchers ab initio, or he has grossly libelled\nthem in the rest of his article by representing them as ' mystics ' and\nadvocates of a ' supernatural ' view of the alleged phenomena. Among\nthe horns of this dilemma I must leave him to choose the one on which to\nimpale himself, and would ask him only to look up S.P.R. Proceedings, No.\n1, p. 4.1\nIt is because of this initial misrepresentation of the aims of the Society\nthat he seems throughout incapable of conceiving any other motive for\ntaking an interest in anomalous phenomena than a morbid love of the mar\nvellous qua unintelligible, or, as he would call it, ' supernatural. ' That it\nis possible to contemplate such matters in the spirit of an explorer, of a\nC.O.S. worker, or of a detc.tive (those who are familiar with the practical\nworking of the Society and have suffered at its hands, indeed, have often\ncomplained of the excess to which it had carried this last spirit), that it is\npossible to he animated by a desire to extend the sway of scientific method\nover unconquered ground, and to rejoice rather than repine when the new\nfacts have been connected with the old principles (which, however, they\noften transform), that it is possible to take up the subject from a keen sense\nof the scientific scandal and social dangers perpetuated by abandoning it\nto the vagaries of superstition, in short, from a self-sacrificing willingness to\n\"take up the white man's burden\"\u2014all these are alternative motives which\nProfessor Miinsterberg is sedulous to ignore. Yet he might have found one\n1 Perhaps, however, in view of the difficulty he seems to find in grasping the\npoint of the literature he reads with such rapidity, I had better quote for him an\nextract from the inaugural circular: \"The aim of the Society will be to approach\nthese various problems without prejudice or prepossession of any kind, and in the\nsame spirit of exact and unimpasaioned inquiry which has enabled Science to solve\nso many problems once not leas obscure nor less hotly debated. The founders of the\nSociety fully recognise the exceptional difficulties which surround this branch of\nresearch ; but they nevertheless hope that, by patient and systematic effort, some\nresults of permanent value may be attained.\"\n\fPart xxxv.] Psychology and Psychical Research. 351\nor other of them expressed on almost every page of every presidential\nexhortation ever delivered unto the members of the S.P.R. !\nBut not only is Professor Miinsterberg's definition of mysticism in\napplicable to Psychical Research, it is also liable to grave exception in itself.\nIs it possible, e.;;., to put an intelligible interpretation on the phrase 'super\nnatural connection' ? Prima facie it seems a contradiction in terms ; for to\nProfessor Miinsterberg the ' supernatural ' is that which is not connected\nwith nature. If it is connected in any stable and calculable fashion, it ipso\nfarlo becomes a fit subject for scientific investigation, i.e., becomes natural.\nIf, therefore, Professor Miinsterberg had thought his definition sound, he\nmight have contented himself (and his readers) by pointing out that the\nconception of 'mysticism' was self-contradictory, by inferring 'ergo cndit\nqiwstio ' and stopping ' right there.'\nAgain, a dangerous ambiguity seems to lurk in the phrase about the\nconnections being ' in ' the physical and psychical worlds. As a philo\nsopher who ventures to soar to the metaphysical heights he reaches later,\nProfessor Miinsterberg must of course know quite well that these worlds\n( are not separate universes, but aspects of the world (of experience), or\nrather, the results of special methods of handling our experience. Hence, in\none sense, any fact will be ' out of,' e.g., the physical world, when it does\nnot lend itself to treatment by the established methods of physics, and so is\nignored by them. But of course it goes on existing just the same, and may\nreceive recognition in another science or by other methods. That is, it will\nremain ' in ' the physical world in a wider sense, and so long as it coheres\nwith other facts (or aspects of facts) it must be capable of scientific explora\ntion, and the only question will be as to the proper method of investigating.\nThe only sin against the Holy Ghost of Science or, less metaphorically,\nagainst the fundamental assumption of all science, which it is possible to\ncommit, is the assertion that any fact can be incapable of being connected\nwith others. This offence is far from the thought of the psychical\nresearcher, but by implication Professor Miinsterberg commits it whenever\nhe argues against the recognition of any fact on the ground that it is\n' supernatural,' and allows his fears to dictate his arguments.\nHaving started from a vicious definition, Professor Miinsterberg is forced\nto justify it by ascribing to his 'mystics' an utterly anti-scientific attitude.\nA lay observer is not allowed to use the teleological language of ordinary life\nin expressing the connection of phenomena as they appeared to him, without\nhaving his words twisted into a denial of the possibility of a scientific con\nnection of events. Now, of course, Professor Miinsterberg may nourish\nwhatever metaphysical prejudices he pleases1 against the teleological\nexplanation of tilings, but there are two things which they do not entitle\nhim to do : (1) They do not entitle him to treat a teleological ordering of\nevents as no order at all\u2014that is merely begging the question, and brings\nhim into conflict with all the religions as well as with ' mysticism ' ; and\n(2) they do not entitle him to overlook the fact that in many sciences the\n1 His argument on p. 83 amounts to an assertion that a final cause is no cause\u2014\na doctrine open to much objection philosophically, and only apparently borne out by\nthe present practice of the natural sciences.\n\f352 [Suppkment.\nF. C. S. Schiller.\nteleological explanation often yields the clue which leads on to the discovery\nof the mechanism whereby the effect is mediated. Thus, in biology, the\npurpose of an organ is often far more easily apparent than the mechanism\nby which it functions. Similarly, if departed spirits did communicate, we\nmight detect tchy long before we discovered how they did so. To declare,\nthen, one's belief that certain events are purposive does not in the least\nimply that they are not also mechanical, according as we contemplate them\nin one way or in another.\nn.\nI do not know whether the true mystic, if such there be, would resent\nProfessor Miinsterberg's account of his mental attitude as a distortion, or,\nas is more probable, would remain profoundly indifferent to anything that\nmight be urged by so unsympathetic a critic. But I do know that Professor\nMiinsterberg's distortions of his opponents' views must not be acquiesced in\nwhen they affect people who do aim at precision in the use of their technical\nwords. His caricatures are not even correctly drawn, and are hardly recog\nnisable. Thus he does not scruple freely to use the technical term which\nthe S.P.R. has introduced in its infancy, and has clung to ever since, viz..\nTelepathy. But this is how he defines it (p. 68) : \"To perceive in an incom\nprehensible way the ideas and thoughts of others.\" On the other hand, the\nSociety has unvaryingly defined its meaning as \"the transmission of\nthoughts and feelings from one mind to another by no recognised channel oi\nsense.\"1 It seems impossible to ascribe to Professor Miinsterberg either\nsuch linguistic ignorance or such logical incapacity as would lead to the\nsubstitution, without a suspicion of the scope of the change, of \"incompre\nhensible \" for \" uncomprehended.\" By what psychological processes, then,\ndid he extract his interpretation from the literature which he claims to have\nexamined ?\nAt any rate, a candid critic could not but have observed that the official\ndefinition of telepathy in no wise excluded transmission either through as\nyet unrecognised sensory channels or through a supernormal intensifying of\nthe recognised channels ; i.e., telepathy includes both hyperesthesia and\nphysical hypotheses of the ' brain wave : type, and it is simply one of\nthe many delusions with which the subject teems to suppose that the\nrecently alleged extensions of hyperaesthesia constitute a refutation of the\ntelepathic hypothesis. They simply show how completely right the S.P.R.\nwas 15 years ago in holding that the bounds of science had to be enlarged to\ntake in the new facts. On the other hand, the suggestion that telepathic\ntransmission is incomprehensible is a request that the S.P.R. should\ngratuitously commit suicide.\nNot but what a strong criticism might be directed against the telepathic\nexplanation on grounds other than those Professor Miinsterberg saw fit\n1 \"All impressions received at a distance without the normal operation of the\nrecognised sense organs\" are telepathic. S.P.R. Proceedings, I., p. 147, ef. 1L.\npp. 44, 117, et passim. Mr. Podmore, whom Professor Miinsterberg hold* up to\nscientific execration, explicitly states that, \"though there are grounds sufficient to\njustify telepathy as a working hypothesis, the proof of its transcendental nature is still\nwanting.\" Studies in Psychical Research, 1897, p. 8.\n\fPart XXXV.] 353\nPsychology and Psychical Research.\nto adopt. For telepathy is, after all, not a positive explanation but a\nnegation, arrayed in the garb of an affirmation, and crying aloud to gods\nand men for a more positive definition. Hence the effect that it seems to\ntriumph to its own loss, that in proportion as the facts for which it obtained\nrecognition find positive grounds of explanation and enrich the sphere of\nscience, its own foundations seem to be withdrawn. But this would be\ndistressing only if the psychical researcher were, as Professor Munsterberg\ninsinuates, interested in the growth, not of knowledge, but of mystery.\nAnd if the S.P.R. be accused of having been somewhat slow in develop\ning the positive content of 1 telepathy,' it may fairly urge in defence that\nits workers were few, and that other needs were more pressing. The main\nuse of the conception of telepathy was to assist in the analysis of the far\nmore anomalous phenomena of spiritism and ghost-seeing. Of the con\nsequence that the proof of spirit-life, spirit identity and spirit agency was\nthereby rendered indefinitely more difficult, Professor Miinsterberg betrays\nnot the least suspicion. He treats telepathy throughout as but the most\nmodern avenue to the Hall of Illusion. And yet, if he had only seen it,\ntelepathy would have served his purpose far better if he had not abused\nit, but used it, like, e.g., Mr. Podmore, to arrest the premature flights of\nsuperstition. Hence the ingenious author of the tftvilies in Psychical\nResearch figures only as \" the most ardent believer in telepathy \" (p. 77),\nanxious to credit needless marvels. Just as if his perhaps somewhat hyper\ncritical studies did not embody incomparably the most successful attempt to\ntake a sceptical view of the phenomena as a whole, as if they did not strike\na far more telling blow at superstition than the collective efforts of all the\na priori scoffers from the days of Hume onwards !\nIt is clear, then, that Professor Miinsterberg has grossly misrepresented\nboth the aims and methods of the S.P. R., and the character of the explana\ntions which it has, quite provisionally, suggested. In other words, the\nsecret dottier which he reveals does not refer to the S.P.R. \" Ve canaille\nde D.\" is not Dreyfus, and whoever reads it thus reads it wrong, and\nknows it. Professor Munsterberg owes the Society an apology, and in\nview of the extent of his obligations to its critical work (from which his\nexplanations derive all the real force they possess), poetic justice would\nseem to demand that he should at least contribute to its funds the ill-\ngotten gains of his Atlantic Monthly article !\nIII.\nStrictly speaking, I might end here\u2014after vindicating the integrity of\nthe only approximation to a Cour de Cassation which exists in this\nanalogue of the Dreyfus Case against the irresponsible attack of a would-\nbe Quesnay de Beaurepaire. But I cannot resist the temptation of\ncommenting still further on some of the many delectable passages in Pro\nfessor Miinsterberg's article.\nProfessor Miinsterberg has a pretty knack of enunciating sonorous\nmaxims which, upon examination, turn out either not to be relevant or\nnot to be intelligible. Let us take, for instance, the impressive dictum\nwhich tells us (p. 69) that \"the psychologist insists that every perception\n\f354 F. C. S. Schiller.\nof occurrences outside of one's own body, and every influence beyund\none's own organism, must be intermediated by an uninterrupted chain ot\nphysical processes.\" Surely Professor Miinsterberg need feel no anxiety\nlest this should seem \"an apparently arbitrary decision\"\u2014for no require\nment can be more easily complied with. Does not the continuity of\nSpace mediate between all processes that occur in the perceptual universe x\nand would not the weirdest miracle that a theological imagination ever\nconcocted be accompanied by \"an uninterrupted chain of physical pro\ncesses \" ? And, contrariwise, would not the laxness of the maxim open\nwide the door to the wildest claims of hyperiesthesia that might be\nadvanced by any pseudo-scientific 'crank'? Professor Miinsterbers s\nadmissions arouse the gravest apprehensions. A blind man, he tells us.\nmay perceive distant obstacles by touch (p. 70), ', but that does not con\nflict with the propositions of psychology, and is not mystical,\" and \"even\nif a man . . . had a sense-organ for electric currents more sensitive\nthan the finest galvanometer, the psychologist would have no reason rot\nskepticism, so long as the physical nature of the transmission from the\nouter object to the brain is admitted.\" Such portentous credulity would\nrender him the victim of any swindler who claimed to perform his tricks\nby ' physical ' means, while to the honest investigator, who observed the\nfacts but did not come prepared with figments to ' explain ' them, Science\nwould say: \" Avaunt, vile mystic, if thou canst not show thy physical\nmediation, thy physical substrata \" ! Something must somehow have gone\nwrong with critical canons which lead to such results !\nThe truth is, of course, that Professor Miinsterberg is once m'ire\njuggling with the double meaning of 'physical' mentioned above (p. 351).\nand trying to infer from the (assumed) impossibility of treating an alleged\nfact by the present methods of the special science of physics that it can\nhave no existence in a world which (among its many other aspects) is al&>\nphysical. But, to my limited intelligence, it appears almost inconceivable\nto suppose that any fact should not have a physical aspect, however sub\nordinate, while it is obvious that the principles of physics are not rigid and\nimmutable, like the famous ' laws of the Medes and Persians.' Hence I\ncannot but think that the attempt to proscribe any fact a priori, on the ground\nof the le-ie majeste it commits against the laws of physics, necessarily fails. No\nindependent jury would convict a fact of the humblest and most suspicious\ncharacter on such grounds\u2014whatever verdict might be extracted from a\npacked and hoodwinked court-martial of Professor Miinsterberg's laboratory\nassistants.\nAnd the same objection disposes also of Professor Miinsterberg's laboured\ncontentions that (for some reason which he never succeeds in making clear)\n' mystical ' phenomena are incompatible with the causal connection and\nmechanical treatment postulated by science. Professor Miinsterberg, I\nmake bold to say, is perfectly aware that this is all moonshine, that the\nmechanical explanation, just because it is a method of science, is universally\napplicable ; that the causal connection as an 'a priori ' postulate is the\nsame ; and that if, for the purposes of special sciences or for the sake of\nexcluding distasteful facts, its scope has been unduly narrowed, nothing is\neasier or more imperative than to expand it to any requisite degree. I\n\fPart XXXV.] 355\nPsychology and Psychical Research.\nshould also like to credit him with the knowledge 1 that a mechanical and\n(in his sense) causal explanation of a fact in no wise excludes, prejudices,\nor dispenses with, its explanation by higher categories, and that all the\nHigh Priests of all the Sciences in solemn conclave assembled could not\neffectively taboo the ' romantic ' and teleological interpretation of the\nfacts of life.\nIV.\nI may pass next to what is perhaps the cleverest thing in Professor\nMiinsterberg s article, viz., the splendid audacity with which he interprets\naway the rout to which scientific dogmatism has so often been put by the\nvictorious intrusion of new facts. \"It is absurd,\" he says (p. 83), \" for the\nmystics to claim the backing of history, because it shows that many things\nare acknowledged as true to-day which were not believed in earlier times.\nThe teaching of history, on the contrary, annihilates almost cruelly every\nclaim of mysticism, as, far from a later approval of mystical wisdom, history\nhas in every case remoulded the facts until they have become causal ones.\nIf the scientists of earlier times disbelieved in phenomena as products of\nwitchcraft, and believe to-day in the same phenomena as products of\nhypnotic suggestion and hysteria, the mystics are not victorious but defeated.\nAs long as the ethical (sic) category of Satanic influence was applied to the\nappearances they were not true ; as soon as they were brought under the\ncausal categories they were accepted as true, but they were then no longer\nmystical\u2014it was not witchcraft any more. This process of transformation\ngoes on steadily ; millions of propositions which life suggests remain untrue\ntill they are adjusted.\"\nIf Professor Miinsterberg means what he says by his last remark, it\nwould follow that for lack of a little ' adjustment ' he was losing his chance\nof becoming the greatest discoverer of truth the world has yet seen, a\nveritable millionaire of verities, in fact ! If, again, he means what he says\nin his last sentence but one, it would follow that he should swallow any yarn\nso soon as any one has taken the trouble to coat it over with an illusory\nvarnish of ' causal ' phrases.\nBut I am loth to think that he should really believe that the truth or\nfalsehood of reported facts can depend on the atmosphere of worthless a\npriori theories with which we surround them before investigation. If that\nwere all, it would be contemptibly easy to make the extremest assertions\nlook respectable, and to put Professor Miinsterberg in a hole whence he\ncould extricate himself only by conversion to the principles of psychical\nresearch ; I myself should not need that provocation to undertake to show\nthat, with unlimited license of conjectural extension, the orthodox principles\nof suggestion, hallucination and the ' threshold ' of consciousness would be\nquite capable of ' accounting for ' far more marvels than have ever been\n1 He has read his colleague, Professor James', Will to Believe, though he mis\nrepresents it. And though his metaphysics, as will be shown (p. 307), result in an\nimpossible separation of the world of phenomena from that of reality, they do contain\na sort of admission that both the mechanical and the teleological explanations are\n(in different senses) true.\n\f356 [Supplement\nF. C. 8. Schiller.\nalleged,1 whereas the real difficulty of the subject is to authenticate thefads,\nand as soon as a sufficient supply of authentic facts has been accumulated, no\ndifficulty has ever been encountered in fitting them on to previous facts. To\nProfessor Miinsterberg the important aspect of this process is that the facts\nshould have fitted ; to the psychical researcher, that the facts should have\nbeen admitted\u2014the one is anxious to recover from the shock to his prejudices,\nthe other to obtain recognition for unappreciated truth. It is obvious\nwhich of these is the more scientific attitude. And the triumph of\nscience over ' mysticism ' which Professor Miinsterberg here discovers\nis a triumph only over his own absurd conception of mysticism, while the new\nfacts triumph, not over science, but over the prepossessions of the scientists\nwho arrogated to themselves the monopoly of truth. If any historical fact\nis certain, it is surely this, that if those who had faith in the unknown\npossibilities of existence had allowed themselves to be deterred by the ,i\npriori denunciations of those who thought like Professor Miinsterberg, the\nexistence of, e.g., hypnotism would never have been brought to light. And\nif Professor Miinsterberg regards the hundred years' struggle before the\nfacts were grudgingly admitted a creditable chapter in the history of science,\nI can comparo his audacity only to that of a theologian who should regard\nthe history of witch-burning as a credit to theology, or of a member of\ncertain historic Sanhedrim who should take credit for his part in promoting\nthe establishment of the Christian religion by stimulating Pontius Pilate's\nsomewhat torpid zeal for the discharge of his official duties !\nV.\nAt intervals in the course of his article Professor Miinsterberg betrays\nsymptoms of an uneasiness about the progress of his crusade against\n' mysticism.' Thus, when about half-way through, he confesses (p. 75) that\nso far \"we have given decisions, but not arguments.\" One cordially agrees\nand after this expects a revolution in the logical texture of the article. But,\nalas, it goes on very much as before. Then Professor Miinsterberg makes\nanother effort and invokes the suprasensible truths of metaphysics to supply\nhim with reasons for the utter rejection of mysticism a priori. The appeal\nis successful, and for the rest of the article the lay reader struggles gallantly\nwith Professor Miinsterberg's attempts to express thoughts that lie too deep\nfor words and intelligible statement, and to bring them to bear on a very\nsimple dispute about facts. At first one is inclined to hold that this recourse\nto metaphysics is merely due to Professor Miinsterberg's inability to find\nany more conclusive reasons, and forms his version of the old story : '' Xo\ncase\u2014abuse the plaintiff's attorney,\" viz., \"No case; drag in metaphysics!,'\nBut attentive reflection soon discovers that the real reason is somewhat\ndifferent.\nProfessor Miinsterberg is a victim of the Germanic spirit. So he cannot\ncontent himself with simply telling the ' mystics ' that their facts are in\npoint of fact illusory. He cannot be happy until he has convinced himself\n1 As, indeed, I pointed out five years ago in Philosophical Review, Vol. Ill-\nNo. 4, pp. 488-9.\n\fPart XXXV.] 357\nPsychology and Psychical Research.\nthat they are a priori impossible. Before he can be got to admit a fact as a\nfact, he must be provided with a proof that it is possible, and see that it has\na passport duly vised and officially stamped, entitling it to find a home in\nthe world of science. He can no more help doing this than the British\nspirit can help ferreting out the facts first of all and postponing to sub\nsequent leisure the task of devising an explanation for them.\nNow personally I have much sympathy with metaphysical prejudices,\nand am reluctant to sacrifice their brilliance to the laborious pertinacity of\nthe sounder British method. I do not therefore propose to be hard on\nProfessor Miinsterberg's metaphysics. They are a national infirmity rather\nthan a personal eccentricity or an attempt to confuse the issue, and I will be\nmerciful to them (and to my readers). Hence I shall say as little aa\npossible about them, and, lest I should spoil their aesthetic effect, shall\nconfine myself to quotations.\n\"Our real inner life is a system of attitudes of will which we do not per\nceive as objects of consciousness,\" and the \"causal view has not the slightest\nmeaning for this inner reality.\" \"The real inner life in its teleological\nreality is spaceless and timeless\" and is \"in short not a psychological fact at\nall.\" \" Life as seen from a psychological point of view . . . is utterly\nworthless.\" A future life, therefore, as understood hitherto, is \"a violation\nof the ethical belief in immortality \" which \" means that we as subjects of\nwill are immortal ; that is, we are not reached by death.\" Nay, (in this\nsense) \" immortality is certain ; for him, the denial of immortality would be\neven quite meaningless.\" This, then, is the real idealism and the true\nimmortality, which cannot become a vulgar object of desire to any one, while\nwith the exception of a few professorial ' immortals ' ' every one escapes his\nown notice possessing it.' No wonder Professor Miinsterberg gets angry\nwith those who are trying to profane his transcendental ideals by dragging\nthem down to a world in which they themselves live, and change, and\nsuffer, and speak intelligibly !\nWhen such monsters of metaphysical mountains labour to crush Mrs.\nPiper, the unsympathetic comment of bystanders is not wanted. I shall\nremark, therefore, only that Professor Miinsterberg's metaphysic is Schopen-\nhauerism, that it has inherited Kant's insoluble difficulty of the double\ncausation of every event, phenomenally and really, and that in any case it\nis not really relevant to the point under dispute.1\nThe only thing that really matters about Professor Miinsterberg's meta\nphysics is that they constitute him a mystic of the most pronounced type\u2014\nin his own sense of the word. For he denies all connections between his two\nworlds, that of psychology and that of reality : hence each is 'super\nnatural,' and neither is intelligible, to the other. Our experience as a whole\nalso becomes unintelligible, because it is cleft in twain irremediably by the\ntwo worlds Miinsterberg the Professor has set up. And this is sad, but it is\nso ; though it need not have caused any surprise to those who have observed\n1 If I were disposed to make trouble I might say a good deal more. I should\nurge, e.g.,that acts and purposes in a world which is out of time would seem to be sheer\nnonsense ; that ethical valuations are facts in time as much as any other, and have\nnothing to do with Professor Miinsterberg's \" ethical belief in immortality \" ; that he\nis inconsistent in a variety of ways, etc., eto.\n\f358 [Supplement\nF.

Once more a priori scepticism has played into the hands of\nsuperstition and puts obstacles into the intermediate path of Psychical\nResearch !\nVI.\nMinora canamiui. It is a relief to turn from such excursions into ' the\nvast inane ' to the pleasant side-lights Professor Munsterberg sometimes\nthrows on his personal characteristics. He is a very Galahad among\npsychology professors. He has never, he assures us, \" taken part in a\ntelepathic experiment or in a spiritualistic seance.\" But he once had a\nthrilling adventure \" with two famous telepathists in Europe \" (p. 77), who\nhad discovered \"a medium of extraordinary powers\" at a distance, unfor\ntunately, which would have involved him in \"15 hours' travelling\"\u2014no slight\njourney even for a well-girt man. For a moment the professor wavered iii\nhis decision, and his mighty mind was nigh o'erthrown. But, before he had\nstarted, the telepathists had discovered the fraud. A most providential\nescape, surely ; for if the professor had come and seen, he might have been\nconquered, and then a flood of superstition might have swept us all back\ninto the Middle Ages ! But, after all, his (and our) escape was not, as he\nconfesses, so much due to his scientific caution as to his dilatoriness ; the\nvirgin purity of his scientific character was preserved unsullied only by hi*\nprofessorial slowness in packing his trunks ! 1 Perhaps his readers would\nhave been more interested to hear the reason why he has never expended a\ncouple of hours and of 5-cent car fares and, fortified only with, say, a\ncouple of bags and a choice selection of psychological instruments, tried his\nluck with Mrs. Piper ! After such heroic readiness to pack his trunks for\na 15-hour journey, that seems a little strange.\nThe reason, doubtless, lies in his sense of the surpassing innocency of\nhis character. He is in very deed \"the Israelite in whom there is no guile\"\nwe read of in the Scriptures. \" Why do I avoid these seances?\" he asks\npathetically. \" It is not because I am afraid that they would shake my\ntheoretical views and convince me of mysticism, but because I consider it\nundignified to visit such performances .... and because I know I should\nbe the last man to see through the scheme and discover the trick \" (p. 78).\nAnd, after an appeal to the effete old ignava ratio that a conjuror and\nnot a scientist is the proper person to detect trickery,2 he proceeds to\n1 Note the plural.\n,2 This seems a truism a. priori, but is not borne out by experience. For such ex\nperts have often most unreservedly admitted the supernormal character of many of\nthe disputed facts\u2014even where the scientists subsequently discovered trickery. The\nexplanation, of course, is that the expert is quite as liable (or in some cases, because\nof his conceit of knowledge, even more liable) to be deceived by trickery on lines\nwhich are unfamiliar to him. And, as Messrs. Hodgson and Davey have shown, the\nsubtler sort of spiritistic fraud really rests on a higher plane than ordinary conjuring\".\nIt rests not so much on the deception of the senses by apparatus and prestidigitation,\nbut on the fact that the spectator is induced to deceive himself by lapses of attention\nand errors of interpretation. Hence his mental processes present far subtler, more\ncomplicated and interesting psychological problems than those of the conjuror,s\naudience.\n\fPart XXXV.] 35!)\nPsychology and Psychical Research.\ncommend himself, and his science, for his lack of detective insight. As an\nexperimental psychologist he is by his whole training \" absolutely spoilt for\nthe business of a detective.\" He does not know \"another profession in\nwhich the suspicion of constant fraud becomes so systematically inhibited\nas it does in that of the scientist.\" Daily work in a scientific laboratory he\nregards \"as a continuous training of an instinctive confidence in the honesty\nof one's co-operators.\" Hence, he implies, Zollner, Richet, Crookes, etc.,\nwere deceived, aud he was saved from a like fate only by his resisting the\ntemptation to investigate\u2014or, more precisely (as we saw above) by the\nfortunate delay in packing his trunks !\nNow, of course, we must accept Professor Munsterberg's description of\nhis own idiosyncrasy. I am quite ready to believe that he is as easy to\ndeceive as he is difficult to convince. But on the other points of this argu\nment I take leave to differ.\nI think he exaggerates the incompetence of other scientific men in\npsychical research when he judges them by himself. They are, of course,\nnot born experts in psychical research, but become such by a pretty\nsevere training, in the course of which they may often fall into error.\nFor they are no more infallible in their observations than in their\na priori convictions. An instinctive insight into the possibilities of\nfraud comes to them, as to the detective, only as the fruit of long\nexperience. (That is just why I am not impressed by the authority of\nscientists whose qualifications resemble Professor Munsterberg's.) But they\ncan make themselves very fair judges of trickery, though perhaps they\nwould do well, both before and after investigating, to consult with a real\nexpert with the long and varied experience of, e.g., Dr. Hodgson. And it is\njust because isolated investigation is so hazardous, because experience and\nspecial study are so valuable, that it is so desirable that the S.P. R. should\nhave the means to employ dozens of trained investigators, who ' know the\nropes,' and are fully alive to all the difficulties of the subject, instead of\none. For our science here stands shivering on the shore of an ' unharvested\nsea ' of unknown dimensions.\nAgain, I am a little reluctant to accept Professor Munsterberg's account\nof the experimental psychologists' superhuman guilelessness. This may in\npart be due to the unfortunate outcome of my only attempt to enlist an\nexperimental psychologist's co-operation in a ' psychical ' experiment. He\ntook advantage of the opportunity to secure the failure of the experiment.\nNo doubt his scientific conscience permitted, nay, persuaded, him to protect\n' science ' against the possible inroads of ' superstition ' by such means,\nbut after this I naturally incline to guard myself against the possibilities of\ndeception on both sides. For it is decidedly humiliating to have escaped\nthe wiles of the professional mediums only to fall a victim to the excessive\nzeal of a professorial psychologist, whose good faith one had taken for\ngranted !\nFurther, and this is a contention which has a wider scope, I would main\ntain that, whatsoever may be the natural and acquired guilelessness of\npsychologists de facto, they have no business to pride themselves on it and\nto cultivate it de jure, and that if Professor Munsterberg's account of the\nmental attitude of himself and his ' experimental ' confreres is correct, it pro\n2 B\n\f360 F. C. S. Schiller.\ntanto unfits him, and them, for the prosecution of delicate psychological\ninquiries. For the obstacles which impede the attainment of truth in\nPsychical Research and in ' experimental ' psychology are in many important\nrespects identical. And if the psychical researcher has to recognise the\nsuperior position of experimental psychology in many respects,1 and may\nlearn not a little from its ingenious use of mechanical contrivances for\nrecording and controlling observations, yet on the other hand the psychical\nresearcher has acquired an openness of mind and a practical experience of\nthe sources of psychologic error, which might be applied to psychological\nexperiments in a most fruitful and revolutionary manner.\nVery possibly such assertions will strike Professor Miinsterberg as novel\nand preposterous, and he will feel inclined to retort that he puts his trust in\ninstruments which cannot lie, and apparatus which cannot be hallucinated\nAnd in a limited sense this is doubtless true : instruments are a migbty\ndefence against fraud, though, like all fortifications, they require to be\nmanned by the right sort of garrison and to be properly looked after, in the\nabsence of which care it is, c.;y., perfectly easy to produce bogus 'spirit,\nphotographs from the most trustworthy cameras. So that the use of instru\nments of the most marvellous exactness alone will not prevent deception if\nthe experimenters cannot be trusted.\nBut the charge is that in psychical researches they cannot be trusted,\nwhereas in ' experimental ' psychology they can, and it is here that 1\nfind the home of the delusion which purl,s up the psychologist with su\noverweening a conceit of his own superiority, with so overbearing a\ncontempt for the poor psychical researcher struggling amid the pitfalls of\ndeception. But this view of the situation may be shown to be utterly\nerroneous.\nIn the first place, it is not true that exposure to deliberate deception is\nthe only or the chief difficulty which besets psychical research. No one whu\nhas had any considerable practical familiarity with the evidence and the\nprocess of collecting it, believes that conscious deception is the source of\nany considerable part of it, or that an appreciable percentage of thr\nnarrators of marvellous stories are liars, pure and simple. There are such\ncases, and they throw much valuable light on the study of human mendacity\n(even though it may not be possible to determine by their means the co\nefficient of human mendacity with mathematical accuracy), even as one hv-\nheard of bogus statistics and bogus surveys in other sciences. Occasionally\na well-constructed and well-sustained lie may impose even on an expert,\nthough, fortunately, this danger is rapidly diminishing as the methods of\ncriticism of 'psychical' evidence are becoming better understood, and as\nthe social atmosphere grows more favourable to the truthful reporting o:\nsuch experiences. Even the possibilities of fraudulent ' mediumship '\nhave become pretty well understood, with the result that the area of the\nphenomena calling for investigation has been correspondingly restricted-\nOn the whole, therefore, the danger of deception from deliberate and con\nscious fraud and mendacity is not serious, and it would be as absurd to\n1 Especially as regards its financial resources and its command of the well-paid\nservices of hundreds of workers with a high academic ttatut.\n\fPart XXXV] 361\nPsychology and Psychical Research.\nexplain the mass of phenomena in this way as to hold that the constancy of\nthe experimental results obtained by psychologists was due only to a tacit\nconspiracy to foist a profitable pseudo-science upon the universities of the\nworld. The real danger lies elsewhere. It is, as Plato says, a ' lie in the\nsoul' and not 'in words.' It lies in the as yet unexplored possibilities of\nunconscious and self-deception, of hallucination and suggestion. Of the\nsubtle sophistications which lurk in these agencies we know as yet so little\nthat one sometimes thinks that a new era in psychology might spring from\nan attempt to answer the question\u2014How are collective hallucinations\npossible ? It must be admitted that the psychical researcher is here largely\ngroping in the dark, sustained only by the consciousness that every moment\nhe stumbles upon something new and unexpected, and that his best security\nlies in his acute appreciation of the peril of his position.\nBut what about the 'experimental' psychologist? His position is pre\ncisely analogous, only he does not appear to know it !\n(1) Like the psychical researcher with his 'sensitives,' he has to confine\nmost of his experiments to a very limited section of the human race, viz.,\nthose who are not only educated up to the point of understanding them, but\nare also constitutionally endowed with a rare capacity of resisting the tedium\nof performing them.\n(2) Like him, he puts his subjects under abnormal conditions and assumes\nthat what is found to hold of mental processes under ' experimental '\nconditions will apply also to them under the normal conditions of natural\nlife. This he does, although he knows quite well that the limen of conscious\nness and the capacity of attention vary most surprisingly according to the\ninterest which the subject inspires.\n(3) Like the psychical researcher he is dealing with conditions which\ngive the widest possible scope to mguestion. But unlike the former ho\nseems to have been (at all events until recently) blissfully unconscious of the\nfact and to have taken no appreciable precautions against the vitiation\nof his results from this source.1 Yet the conditions of the ordinary\npsychological laboratory are almost the ideal conditions for inducing a\nmaximum of suggestibility. First of all the subject's mind is prepared by\nimpressive and dogmatic statements of his professor to expect certain results.\nThen he is steeped in a literature admirably calculated to lower his vitality,\nto stupefy his critical capacity, to abase his imagination, until no thought can\nenter it of any but a certain sort of result. Meanwhile he is subjected to a\nthorough course of ' ward training ' in the laboratory, receiving all the\ntime frequent 'hints' from his director and breathing an atmosphere\nwhich simply reeks with suggestion. When finally he produces his research,\nis it a wonder that in 99 cases out of 100 its results should be found faith\nfully to reflect the assumptions of ' experimental ' psychology in general\nand to confirm the views of the director of his laboratory in particular ?\nAnd do not the training and the ideas instilled in the Leipzig laboratory still\n1 It will suffice to refer to an exception which proves the rule, viz., Professor\nG. A. Tawney (justissimus unui qui fuit in Teucris), who, in an article in the\nPiychological tievicw (Nov., 1897), shows that the 'double-point illusion' is mainly\ndue to auto-suggestion.\n2 b 2\n\f3G2 [Snpplenwol.\nF.

We have then\npositive proofs that the effects of suggestion can vitiate a whole science ; and\nsuggestion can be brought to bear on the youthful minds that frequent\npsychological laboratories with far greater force than even in the palmiest\ndays of the Salp\u00e9triere theory. Would it not then border on a miracle if\nsuch strong suggestions had failed to produce their effect, would it not be\nstill more marvellous if such a ' failure ' should ever be thought worth\nprinting ?\n(4) Like the psychical researcher, the psychological experimenter deals\nwith mental processes whose delicacy renders them peculiarly liable t,>\nhallucination. And when we bear in mind the powerful suggestions that\nare operative throughout the process, it will hardly seem surprising that n\u00bbt\nonly, e.g., the ' perception ' of infinitesimal differences in sensory stimuli and\nthe reactions of an expectant attention upon an imagined signal, but even the\nreadings of a micrometer or the chronoscopic estimates in thousandths of a\nsecond which are needed to produce the required conformity in the results\nshould often be explicable as sheer hallucinations fostered by the peculiar con\nditions of the experiment. Indeed, we even find some such results recorded\nby the psychologists, though without any consciousness, apparently, of their\nmethodological significance. At all events I feel that I personally could\nmatch Professor Miinsterberg's avowal of his limitless capacity to be deceived\nin 'psychical' experiments by an equally frank avowal of my capacity t\"\ndeceive myself in psychological experiments. If I did not succeed in getting\nmyself turned out as an unsuitable subject by failing to see anything at all.\nI am sure I should delude myself into fancying that I saw wh.-i'ever was\nexpected of me. For in such experiments one cannot trust onesulf : there is\noften just the same difficulty about distinguishing a real from a hallucinatory\nsense-perception, as there is in some ' borderland ' experiences about\nsaying whether one is asleep or awake.\n(5) Like the psychical researcher, the psychologist cherishes a weakness\nfor figures\u2014in the one case in the shape of statistics ; in the other in shape\nof 'exact quantitative measurements.' And though, of course, a method\nof inquiry which can use figures is far more provocative of confidence\nthan one which cannot, it may be questioned whether in both cases the\nPythagorean reverence for Number is not often carried to a superstitious\nintensity. To swamp the inquirer with a flood of figures is not necessarily\nto solve a problem, especially while one of the chief doubt* is as to the\nrelevance of the figures. And, on the other hand, it is well known that\nwith skilful manipulation, statistics and ' exact quantitative determina\ntions ' may be made to prove many things, while they serve as opiates to\nthe critical faculty and induce a comfortable glow of scientific rectitude.\nHence the pride which the psychologist takes in his figures may often prove\na snare, and a prelude to his fall from his fancied eminence of uncontested\ntruth.\n\fPart XXXV.) 363\nPsychology and Psychical Research.\nIn addition to the above five points, in which the problems of the psychical\nresearcher and the ' experimental ' psychologist are analogous, I may briefly\nallude to two others in which there is a divergence, significant as bearing on\nthe attitude which tho latter so often takes up towards the former.\n(6) The psychologist deals with partial processes of human mentality,\nisolated as far as possible from their context ; the psychical researcher\ngenerally experiments with the psychical organism as a whole. The former\nprocedure is more in accordance with the analogy of the other sciences\n(though, to be sure, it is here a question how far the analogy holds), but it\nrenders him liable to the charge of false abstraction in ignoring the context\nand the connection of the phenomena studied with the whole mental life.\nThe latter runs the risk of treating as a simple fact what is really the com\nplex resultant of many factors. But, being more concrete, this method is\nmore interesting and more human, as the psychologist cannot but himself\nfeel. And, being irritated both by the popular preference for the wider\nsweep of the more concrete method and by his consciousness of the respon\nsive note it strikes in his own bosom, he reacts upon the temptation by\npouring out the vials of his wrath from time to time in indiscriminate abuse\nof Psychical Research and all its works and ways. Which, though very\nhuman, is foolish, and not science.\n(7) The psychical researcher is aware that he has to deal with what\nappears a more aberrant type of fact, and to exercise the greatest care to\ntake nothing for granted. He must state all the conditions of his experi\nments with the utmost fulness and the greatest attainable accuracy,\nlegarding nothing as too trivial for mention, and sedulously eschewing\nanything like 'cooking' of the evidence And I think that no candid\nreader can deny that such has been the aim of the S.P. R., and that the\nevidence it publishes conforms to the highest standards in an ever-increasing\n>legree as time goes on, and the knowledge of its methods becomes more\nwidely diffused.\nThe facts of the ' experimental ' psychologist, on the other hand, are\nintrinsically of an entirely commonplace character. They are so closely\nconnected with those of the recognised science of physiology, that their\ndependence on it has often seemed mere parasitism. Hence the psychologist\nfeels freer from the restrictions which are imposed on psychical research,\nand his accounts show that he enjoys his freedom to the full. He appears\nto recognise no limits to the suppression of unsuitable records and to the\nselection of the ' facts ' he propounds. And in any case his statement of\nthe conditions is hardly ever full enough to disarm the suspicion that the\nfirst four sources of error I have mentioned have not been adequately\nguarded against. Hence the reports of psychological experiments are\nhardly ever such as to carry conviction to any one disposed to dispute their\nresults ; they are accepted because, as a rule, they shock no antecedent\nprejudice. But this uncritical na'u-ele can hardly be esteemed a recommenda\ntion by an impartial student of the methodology of the sciences, and hence\nProfessor Miinsterberg's complacent delight in the absence of suspiciousness\nfostered by his psychological methods vividly reminds me of General\nMercier's innocent surprise at being informed of the illegality and impro\npriety of his use of the documents whereby tho condemnation of Dreyfus\n\f364 [Supplement.\nF. C. S. Schiller.\nwas secured. It would be far better if, instead of propagating misrepre\nsentations of the S.P.R., Professor Miinsterberg imitated its methods\nsomewhat more closely, and got, e.g., his fellow-townsman, Dr. Hodgson,\nto open his guileless eyes to some of the sources of illusion which infect his\nmost favourite assumptions.\nVII.\nNow why, it may be wondered, have I done Professor Miinsterberg s\nincoherent and ridiculous reasonings (\" R\/iisonniren \" as the Germans aptly\nsay) the honour of so detailed a refutation ? It is not that so elaborate\na counterblast is needed against sophistries which can hardly impose on\ntheir author. It is not for the sake of gaining a dialectical victory and\nhumbling his professorial pride. It is not in the hope of effecting\nhis conversion. For if any man can remain deaf to the charming of\nhis colleague, Professor James, no power in heaven or earth can move\nhim in his prejudices. It is simply because I would put it to MM. Us\nGeneraiu de VEtat-major that, even from their own point of view, they arc\nmaking a mistake in their conduct of this awkward little affair. Their\nmethods of suppressing the 'revisionists' are too crude and inefficient.\nWe want something fresher than a re-hash of the old a priori prejudices in\nlieu of conclusive documents. We want something more unlike the belated\nforgeries of Colonel Henri than Professor Munsterberg's perversions of the\nS.P.R.'s attitude. He is simply adding blunders to the ancient crime*,\nand, from the point of view of humanity, adding crimes to the ancient\nblunders.\nFor, socially speaking, the policy pursued in this Dreyfus Case of Science\nhas been criminal as well as stupid, criminally stupid and stupidly criminal.\nThe success of the S.P.R. , to say nothing of more fanatically 'Dreyfusard'\nassociations, must make it obvious even to the obtusest professor that the\npolicy of the choxe jnyde has failed. It has not achieved what was expected\nof it\u2014it has not burked inquiry. And it is quite plain that it cannot do so\nin the future, however great becomes the growth of Science. For, as the\nsciences grow more specialised and their language more technical, the radius\nof their influence contracts rapidly, their ideas affect the minds of men less\nand less. Already in Professor Miinsterberg's article (unless its obscurity was\nintentional) the real ground of his technical objection to ' mysticism ' can\nhardly have been intelligible to one out of a thousand of educated readers.\nAnd experimental psychology is still in its infancy, crying aloud to every\nalma mater to notice and nourish it. To what depths of technicality and\nobscurity may we not then expect it to descend by the time it is full\ngrown ?\nNow the impotence of science is the opportunity of superstition. It\nflourishes unchecked all around the scientist, who will not compromise his\ndignity by recognising its existence. He cannot check its growth by\narguments so technical that they are understood only by the very few who\nhave been able to spend the best years of their youth in his laboratories.\nHis attitude of a priori disgust is too unsympathetic to have the slightest\neffect upon the convictions of his adversaries who, as Professor James hv\nwell pointed out, \"are indifferent to Science, because Science is so callously\n\fPart XXXV.I 365\nPsychology and Psychical Research.\nindifferent to their experiences.\" 1 In fact, it stands to reason that one\ncannot expect to convince any adherent of mistaken views by either ignoring\nhim or saying to him : \" Now, my good man, you are either a liar or a\nlunatic. \"\nAnd for the scientists to hold utterly aloof from the beliefs of the vulgar\nis just as stupid and dangerous a practice in the end as was that of the\nRoman philosophers to discourse about humanity, while leaving untouched\ninstitutions like that of the gladiatorial games. Similarly the psychologist\nconsumes his energies in researches which, from a social point of view, can\nonly appear ingenious modes of academic trifling, while leaving unexplored\nsubjects which prima facie raise the most stupendous issues, have the\nmost direct practical bearing on society, and most naturally fall into his\nprovince.\nNo wonder, then, that the policy of the clwse jurjee, as practised for the\nlast two centuries, has not eradicated superstition : it has been a blunder.\nBy the same token, it has also been a crime ; for a different policy\nwould have eradicated superstition. And thus the real responsibility\nfor the persistence of superstition lies not with the ignorant masses,\nwho interpreted their experience according to their lights, but with the\neducated Pharisees, whose delicate nostrils were offended at the very\nidea of associating with publicans and sinners. It is these latter who\nare the true obscurantists, who by keeping aloof have kept alive the belief\nin witchcraft, Satanism, and the offensive aspects of supernaturalism\ngenerally, whose consciences ought to be burdened with the unspeakable\nevils these beliefs have brought upon mankind. And if they knew not what\nwould be the effect of their attitude, they were foolish ; if they knew it,\nthey are, to put it mildly, disingenuous. Does it not behove, then, every\ngood scientist and every good citizen to work for the ' revision ' of the\nDreyfus Case of Science 1\n1 TViU to Believe, p 323. Professor Miinsterberg has apparently read this excellent\nessay, and that after doing so he should write as he does gives the measure of what\none would be disposed to call either his moral bias or bis mental obtuseness, if one did\nnot know to what lengths the pathological obfuscation of the psychological intellect\nmay be carried in the discussion of these matters.\n\f.366 F. W. H. Myers.\nIV.\nDR. MORTON PRINCE'S \"EXPERIMENTAL STUDY\nOF VISIONS.\"\nBy F. W. H. Myers.\nThe paper which Dr. Morton Prince allowed us to read at the\nlast meeting of the S.P.R. has now appeared in Brain under the above\ntitle. It describes one of the most curious cases of split personality\nyet recorded ;\u2014a case, however, which is somewhat tantalising, since\nit seems plain that, had Dr. Prince chosen, he might have pushed his\nexperiments in yet more interesting directions. Let us hope that he\nmay in fact have done so, and may ultimately give his observations to\nthe world. Meantime some quotations, with occasional comment, raaj\nbe acceptable to our readers.\nI have had, says Dr. Prince, an opportunity to make some experiments\nof this kind on a particularly favourable subject. In most of the obserra-\ntions reported hitherto, it has not been possible to thoroughly investigate\nthe relation of the vision to antecedent events in the subject's life, beyond\nthe evidence of the waking memory of that person. But in this instance,\nthe fact that it was possible to hypnotise her and obtain tiro additional and\ndistinct personalities, three in all, each with distinct memories, gave an\nopportunity to search in the hidden depths of consciousness, and obtain\ninformation about facts long forgotten by the normal personality. Further,\nit was possible to experimentally study the relation of the sub-conscious\npersonality to, and the influence of this upon, the production of visions.\nTo understand this, it is necessary to state a few facts regarding the\nsubject. Miss X.1 suffers from what is ordinarily called neurasthenia, or\nhystero-neurasthenia, but what I think is more correctly called hysterical\nneurasthenia. But she has no physical stigmata, excepting a possible con\ntraction of the field of vision.2 She is easily hypnotised ; first passing into\na state which resembles that of the ordinary classical deep stage. After\nwaking there is complete loss of memory of this state. During hypnosis she\nis very susceptible to suggestion ; but on the whole there is nothing very\nremarkable about the mental condition, which does not materially differ\nfrom one of the deeper stages of hypnosis as ordinarily observed. The only\npoints to which I would call attention are that Miss X. in this stage of\nhypnosis knows all about Miss X. awake, and apparently remembers all that\n1 Dr. Morton Prince's subject, \"Miss X.,\" is, of course, not to be confused with\nthe former pseudonym of Miss A. Goodrich-Freer.\n* At the time these observations were made this seemed to have disappeared, or,\nat least, could not be recognised by the finger test.\n\fPart xxxv.] Br. Morton Prince on Crystal Visions. 367\nMiss X. remembers and some other things besides, which she has forgotten\nwhen awake ; but Miss X. when awake knows nothing of what has occurred\nin this hypnotic state. For convenience' sake I have called Miss X., in this\nstage of hypnosis, X. 2, as distinguished from Miss X. or X. 1.\nNow, on commanding X. 2 to sleep more deeply, there appears a third\npersonality, whom I have called X. 3. This person knows all about both\nMiss X. and X. 2, everything they do and think, but is unknown to both.\nHer memory, also, in some respects, is much fuller than that of either Miss\nX. or X. 2, so it comes about that X. 3 can tell much in the past life of Miss\nX. that that person has forgotten, and can explain much that the waking\npersonality is at a loss to account for. X. 3 even knows all about many of\nthe little absent-minded and half-voluntary doings of Miss X., nor does she\nhesitate to voluntarily tell of them, although Miss X. is morbidly and\nunnecessarily reserved about her whole life.\nThus far this case seems quite in accordance with analogy. An\nunusual point, however, now follows ;\u2014in the relation of the different\ncharacters of the personalities to each other. In cases already\nobserved we have generally found that the deepest attainable per\nsonality, besides possessing the completed memory, possessed also, on\nthe whole, the most intelligence. In this case, on the other hand,\nthe deepest phase of personality at which we seem to get is the least\nsatisfactory of all.\nIt may only be added that the characters of the three personalities were\nvery different and distinct. Miss X. is reserved, morbidly conscientious,\nself-contained, serious, deferential, and dignified. X. 2 is sad, serious, and\ngives the impression of weariness and suffering. X. 3. is flippant, jovial,\nfree from all physical infirmities, full of fun, reckless, and contemptuous of\nMiss X., whom she stigmatises as silly, stupid, and dull, and in an\napparently heartless way enjoys every trouble that comes to her. X. 3\nalways speaks of Miss X. as \"She,\"1 and insists that they are different\npersons\u2014that they don't think the same tilings or know the same things.\nShe speaks of X. 2 as \" Miss X. asleep.\"\nThis tripartite personage looked in a crystal,\u2014or rather in \" an\n<-lectric-light globe or lamp,\" of course not connected with a circuit,\nbut held free in the hand. The mode of vision was just such as our\nreaders are accustomed to hear of.\nThe visions were not seen like small objects reflected in or oil the glass\nbulb, but Miss X. stated that the bulb disappeared, and she saw before her\nthe scene she described, which appeared real, the characters being life-size\nand like living persons. I should infer that she saw them, much as one\nsees the characters on the stage of a theatre, but she saw them, nevertheless,\nwhere the bulb was. Perhaps the illustration of looking through an opera-\nglass at the stage is apposite, for she several times at first broke off from her\n1 In the following account, She, with a capital S, always refers to Miss X. (X. 1).\n\f368 F. W. H. Myers.\ninspection and examined the bulb to see if there was any explanation of the\nvision to be found in the glass, much as one who had never seen an opera-\nglass or a kaleidoscope might examine it for this purpose. To me as I\nobserved her she appeared like one who, at a theatre, was completely\nabsorbed by the play, and in that sense was unconscious of surroundings, bat\nnot at all in a trance state. Her absorption and the exceeding mobility and\nexpression of her face when describing a vision gave the impression that she\nwas entirely oblivious of myself and surroundings, until spoken to, but not\nas one hypnotised, but rather as one who is intensely absorbed in the scene\nof a theatre and has forgotten where she is. Every feeling, timidity,\nsurprise, interest, seemed to be expressed by the play of her features, and it-\ntimes, especially at first, she seemed rather frightened by the uncanniness of\nwhat she saw. Most of her descriptions were given in answer to my\nquestions, which were continuous but never suggestive. They were simply\nexpressions like \" What else ?\" \"Go on,\" \" Is there anything more ?\" etc.\nIt may be noted, then, as psychologically of interest, that the visions\nappeared like ordinary hallucinations or vivid dreams, the scenes real,\nof life size, but dissociated from her surroundings, and not as part of them.\nThe substance of the visions consisted largely of memories of past\nvisual experiences, but partly also of scenes which the percipient had\nat any rate never discovered with ordinary consciousness. I give first\nan instance of a scene On which Miss X.'s eyes had no doubt looked,\nbut without conscious attention.\nExperiment 4. \u2014X. 3 now (after explaining the last vision) volunteered\nthe following remarkable story, telling it with great gusto and as a joke ou\nMiss X., and speaking with great rapidity, so that it was difficult to follow\nthe sequence of events. The language was substantially that of X. 3, bat\ncondensed. ',She\" yesterday received a letter from a photographer. She\nhad it in her hand while walking down Washington Street, and then put it\ninto her pocket (side pocket of jacket) where She kept her watch and money\n(bank notes). Then as She walked along, She took out the money and tore\nit to pieces, thinking it was the letter from the photographer. She threw\nthe money into the street As she tore up the money she said to herself :\u2014\n\" I wish they would not write on this bank-note paper.\" At my request\nX. 3 repeated the words of the photographer's note, which was to say some\nphotographs were ready. As to the money, there were twenty dollars\u2014\ntwo ten-dollar notes ; this, at my demand, X. 3 counted mentally, with\nsome difficulty and concentration of thought. X. 3 manifested considerable\nunwillingness to show me the letter, which she said was in \"her\" pocket\nstill, and which She still thought to be money. Finally, after some insist\nence, she did so. It was folded up into a small square, just as one often\nfolds bank-notes. The language of the photographer's note was identically\nthe same as quoted by X. 3. X. 3 said that \"She \" was absent-minded, and\nthinking of something else, when \" She \" tore up the money. I then gave\nX. 3 the note to put back in her pocket preparatory to waking her up.\nThis impish, hypnotic personality remarked upon what a joke it would be\nwhen Sho found it there instead of the bank-notes. I will say here the\n\fPart xxxv.] Dr. Morton Prince on Crystal Visions. 36f>\nheartless, cold-blooded delight which this almost Iago-like personality found\nin the loss of the money, which was a very great one to Miss X., was.\nappalling. To X. 3 it was a splendid practical joke.\nMiss X. was now awakened. I asked her whether she did not have some\nmoney and had not received a letter from a photographer. She said \" Yes,\"\nbut seemed to think it rather queer my asking these questions, but by this\ntime she had become accustomed to being astonished. In reply to a series,\nof questions she said she had not the letter with her, but had torn it up\nand thrown it into the street (Washington Street) The bank bills she had\nin her pocket. They were two ten-dollar bills. I asked her to show them to\nme. She put her hand in her pocket to take them out and brought out the\nphotographer's letter. She evidently received a shock, although she tried\nnot to show it. I asked her where the bills were, and after searching hor\npocket, she insisted that she must have left them at home. I remarked that\nshe must have destroyed them by mistake instead of the letter ; she refused\nto admit it. I pointed out the circumstantial evidence ; she recognised that\nit was suspicious, but could and would not believe it. The loss meant a\ngreat deal to her, and she evidently encouraged herself with a forlorn hope.\nI then said, taking the glass globe :\u2014\" We will see whether it is not true.\nLook in and you will see what you have done.\" At first she saw only in\ndifferent things ; then I said:\u2014\"Think of bank-notes and the feeling of\ntearing them up.\" Now, to her astonishment, she saw herself walking along\nWashington Street and putting the letter in her pocket, then taking out\nwhat looked like bank-notes, that is, green pieces of paper, and tearing\nthem into pieces and throwing them into the street. The vision in all its.\ndetails corresponded to the account given by the hypnotic personality.\nThis curious story shows us a secondary personality in (so to sav)\nits most alien and even hostile form ;\u2014such a form as might well\nsuggest actual possession by a malign sprite. Yet the truer analogy ia\nprobably the madman who beats one side of his own body under the\nimpression that it is an enemy.\nI add another quotation which shows the third personality in a\nstriking light;\u2014as remaining alert and unconfused throughout the\nperilous delirium of the primary personality.\n(B) Experiments in which the hallucination was not a revival of a past\nvisual experience, but was largely a newly-created visual representation of a\npast experience other than visual.\nExperiment 5.\u2014I will give this in the brief language of my notes : Miss\nX. looked again into the globe ; she saw a room with a bed in it. There waa\na figure in the bed ; the figure threw off the bed-clothes and got up. Miss\nX. exclaimed :\u2014\" Why, it is I.\" (Appeared rather frightened at what she\nsaw, but went on to describe it, largely in answer to my promptings, such\nas, \"Goon,\" \" What do you see ? \" etc.) She saw herself walking to and\nfro, up and down the room. Then she climbed on to the window sill which\nis the deep embrasure of a mansard roof. Then she climbed outside the\n\f370 LSupplcz&ent.\nF. W. H. Myers.\nwindow and from the sill looked down into the street. It was night\u2014the\nstreet lamps were lighted, there was also the gas light in the room. As she\nlooked down she felt dizzy. Here Miss X. turned away frightened, saying\nshe felt the same dizziness as if she were standing there. She soon con\ntinued. She saw herself throw an inkstand into the street below, which she\nhad seen herself take before climbing on to the window. Miss X. was again\nobliged to stop looking because of dizziness. After a time she returned to\nthe globe. She saw herself go back into the room and walk up and down ;\nthe door opened and she jumped into bed and lay quiet. Miss L. (a friend)\n,entered, went out and returned several times ; brought a poultice which she\nput on Miss X.'s chest ; Miss X. herself remaining quiet. Then Miss L\nwent out and Miss X. got up and took the poultice, rolled it up into a little\nbunch and hid it in a corner, putting a towel over it. Here the experiment\nended.\nMiss X. stated, on being questioned, that she could not remember any\nincident like the vision, excepting that she recognised the room as the first\none she occupied when she came to Boston four or five years ago. It was in\nthe top storey of a house on Columbus Avenue ; she was ill there, and Miss\nL. took care of her. But she did not remamber ever havi?ig climbed on to\nthe window, or having thrown an inkstand, or any of the incidents of the\nvision. She could throw no light on the affair. She was now lightly\nhypnotised and X. 2 was present. X. 2 could add very little to Miss X. 5\nstatement. (My notes of X. 2's memory are somewhat confused ; it is not\nplain from them whether or not she remembered ever having done any of\nthe things seen in the vision, although it is stated that she had an imperfect\nmemory of the incident. It is possible X. 2's statement as noted was mixed\nup with that of X. 3, but X. 2 remembered being ill in the room described,\nand that ink was found in Miss X.'s shoes ; X. 2 did not know how it came\nthere, but Miss L. had said that Miss X. had poured ink in her shoe. At\nany rate, X. 2 could not explain the incident as X. 3 did later.)\nDeep hypnosis ; X. 3 appeared with great vivacity and amusement. X. 3\nexplained the whole scene. (As was customary with her, X. 3 spoke of Miss\nX. (X.) as \" She,\" as if it were an entirely distinct person and not herself.)\n\" She\" had pneumonia and was delirious, and She imagined She was on the\nsea shore and was walking up and down the sand. This was why she walked\nup and down the room, and She stuck her toes in the carpet, thinking it was\nthe sand. There were rocks there, and the window sill was one of them and\nwhen She climbjd out upon the window sill She thought She was climbing\nupon a rock, and she took up a stone, as She thought, and threw it into the\nsea. This was the inkstand that she threw into the street. Then when She\ntook the poultice and hid it in the corner, She thought She had buried it in\nthe sand. She had not poured ink into her shoes, but her hand shook and\nShe had spilled it into her shoes. Miss L., seeing the inkstains, had\ninferred that Miss X. had poured the ink into the shoes, and had told Miss\nX. so. Hence the statements of X. and X. 2. X. 3 was highly amused at\nall the mistakes of Miss X's. delirium.\nFinally, one more quotation, \u2014the last which can be here admitted,\n\u2014indicates the line of inquiry which one must hope that Dr. Morton\n\fPart xxxv.] Dr. Morton Prince on Crystal Visions. 371\nPrince has followed, or will yet follow ;\u2014however cautious he may be\nas to printing the results to which it leads.\nExperiment 8. \u2014Miss X. had lost a scarf pin she valued. 1 suggested\nthat she should try to find it by looking in the globe. After looking a few\nminutes, she saw a bed room with a brass bedstead, and on the dressing-\ntable was a pin-cushion (described in detail), and in the pin-cushion were\nseveral pins. Amongst them she recognised her own, and exclaimed\nsomewhat excitedly \"Why, that is my pin!\" Involuntarily she reached\nout to seize it. During this her face was very expressive, and showed great\nastonishment. She did not recognise the room, and was certain she had\nnever seen it before, but thought it a city room, and not a country one, from\nits general appearance and furnishing.\nIn hypnosis both personalities were also ignorant of this room ; but X. 3,\nbeing asked to tell the last time that Miss X. had the scarf pin, recollected\nperfectly. \"She\" (Miss X.) came into her room (in the country, not in\nBoston) one day with a very severe headache, took the pin out of her dress\nand stuck it into the head of the couch, then doubled up the pillow and\nplaced it over it, and lay down on the couch with her head on the pillow and\nrested. \"She\" forgot all about the pin, and had no recollection of putting\nthe pin where She did, and, in fact, did it rather absent-mindedly. This\nwas several months ago, and X. 3 presumed the pin was gone. On Miss X.\nbeing awakened, I told her what she had done with the pin, but still she had\nno recollection of the affair.\nWas that pin actually in that pincushion 1 Perhaps it was ;\u2014and\nif it was, that fact has no inconsiderable bearing upon the way in\nwhich the world is made.\nMeantime there is one practical lesson\u2014often urged already in\nour Proceedingn,\u2014which these experiments should plainly reinforce.\nCrystal-vision should become one of the habitual and recognised\noccupations of the psychological laboratory. I know of no real\nreason whatever for supposing that the power of seeing these visions\nis commoner in hysterical than in normal patients, or is a token of\nany kind of ' disaggregation.\" This has, indeed, been assumed on\na priori grounds by some writers. And the fact that a good many\nhysterical patients, being under their doctors' control, have been\ninduced to look in the crystal, has inevitably tended to foster the\nassumption. But the relative proportion of normal to hysterical seers\nis as yet undetermined ;\u2014and cannot be determined until a far\ngreater number of normal persons have seriously made the attempt.\nThe instances of normal seers quoted in our Proceedings and in Mr.\nAndrew Lang's Making of Religion represent but the very first hasty\ningathering from a vast and unworked field.

Third Edition, Vol. I., Ch : I : pp. 18-32.\nIntroductory Note by Alfeed R. Wallace.\nIn the last Part of the Proceedings (December, 1898) Mr. Podmore,\nin the preliminary remarks to his \" Discussion of Trance-Phenomena\nof Mrs. Piper,\" devotes more than five pages to an examination of the\n\u2022evidence for clairvoyance in the case of Alexis Didier, which evidence\nhe depreciates throughout, and arrives at the conclusion that Alexis\nmight have been, and probably was, a clever impostor. He urges\nthat \" bandaging the eyes,\" as described, was not \" satisfactory ; \"\nthat many indications showed \" that the power exercised by Alexis\nwas perfectly normal \" ; that the reading a book several pages in\nadvance of any page opened at random was \" the most strongly\nsuggestive of trickery \" ; and that the most probable explanation of\nhis card-playing performances \" is that of deliberate fraud.\" He\nurges that his manager, Marcillet, might have been a confederate,\nand that the reports \" are mostly at second-hand or insufficiently\ndetailed.\" He quotes lengthy reports of some of the special instances\nof clairvoyance which were of such a nature as to be explained by\nthought-reading, but says nothing of those in which facts were\ncorrectly given which were not known to any one present ; and,\nfinally, he omits all reference to the most remarkable and convincing\nevidence of Robert Iloudin, whose testimony has been quoted by\nDr. Lee, by myself, and by many other well-known writers, while a\ndetailed report of it is to be found in the great work of the\nMarquis de Mirville to be seen in the Society's library.\nWhen preparing my reply to Mr. Podmore (which appeared in\nthe Journal of February) I borrowed De Mirville's work, and for\nthe first time read his detailed account of Houdin's experiences\ncertified as correct by Houdin himself. This account seemed to me\nto be so important, as well as so intrinsically interesting, that I\nsuggested the printing of a translation of it in our Proceeding*. To\nthis the Editor has assented, and the following very close translation\nhas been kindly made by Mr. J. G. Smith. So far as I am aware, it\nnow appears for the first time in English, although it has been known\n\f374 [Snpplemefit\nAlfred R. Wallace.\nto a few students for nearly half a century ; and, if it is admitted\nthat the question is one of evidence, it must be held to. prove the\nreality of the clairvoyance of Alexis, both that kind due to thought-\nreading and that termed \" true clairvoyance \" in which the object\ndescribed is not known to any one present or, as in the case of the\ncards dealt by Houdin and the book brought and opened by himself,\nto any living person.\nIn his rejoinder (in the March Journal) Mr. Podtnore admits\nthat \" Houdin's testimony is, no doubt, very striking \" ; but he\nurges that it is not conclusive as against the theory that subjects\nin trance may possess \" preternorraal acuteness of vision.\" To this\nI would reply that any such preternatural acuteness of vision as is\nhere required has never been proved to exist, but has been suggetttd\nas the only means of explaining phenomena deemed too incredible\nfor acceptance on any testimony; and, further, that if trance patients\ncan see through cards, and tables, and eight pages of a printed b wk,\nto admit such \" acuteness of vision \" is only to admit \" clairvoyance\nunder another name.\nI would here earnestly call the attention of our members to a very\nimportant elementary principle of sound reasoning too often neglected\nin discussions of these questions \u2014that, as tersely stated by J. S. Mill,\n\"an argument is not answered till it is answered at its best,\" and that\nno amount of negative or indirect evidence is of any weight as against\ngood, positive, and direct evidence on the other side. I ask them to\ncompare carefully this evidence of De Mirville and Houdin with that\nadduced by Mr. Podmore, and they will find that while the former\nconsists of the very best direct evidence of facts, the latter is wholly\nnegative, consisting of doubts, suspicions, and possibilities, every one\nof which is excluded in the direct evidence here given.\nThis fundamental defect applies, in my opinion, to all Mr.\nPodmore's writings on this subject.\nTranslation.\nYou all know Robert Houdin, and you will deny to this Prince of\nConjurers neither the pre eminence to which his skill entitles him, nor,\nconsequently, his entire competency as a judge of the skill of others.\nEvidently, to put an end to this everlasting and unsound argument,1 the\nonly thing to do was to go and find Robert Houdin himself.\nNo sooner said than done. I am shown into his drawing-room, and our\ninterview begins.\n1 [i.e., that aa Robert Houdin could, by trickery, do everything that clairvoyants\ndid, aud even more, there was no reason to suppose supernormal power in the case of\nclairvoyants.\u2014Translator's note.]\n\fRirtxxxv.l De Mirville on Houdin and Alexis. 375\nI am going now to give a careful word-for-word report, with all the\naccuracy of the Moniteur, of everything that subsequently took place.\nM. Houdin's signature will guarantee the truth of the record.\n\" Monsieur Robert Houdin, I am an admirer of your second sight, but\nwill you kindly tell me if you have any knowledge of magnetism 1 Have\nyou seen any somnambulists 1 \"\n\" A slight knowledge, Monsieur ; I have seen only two somnambulists.\"\n\"What did you think of them ? \"\n\" Their tricks were so badly done, so contemptible, that I could, then\nand there, have given them a lesson.\"\n\"So you regard a somnambulist as a brother conjuror, and often as a\nclumsy one.\"\n\" But how elxe ,could you regard him ? After all, as I said before, I have\nseen only these two poor specimens. All I can say is that in the course of\na journey that I made in Belgium, to Brussels, Liege, and Aix-la-Chapelle, I\nconstantly followed M. Laurent and Mlle- Prudence, two of your ' magnetic '\ncelebrities, and I can assure you that the day after their seances I in\nvariably dissipated, as if by enchantment, their triumph of the previous\nnight. Whereupon, to my great regret (for I have always a genuine dislike\nto causing any one the smallest injury), the kind of stupor of admiration that\nthey had caused was suddenly turned into sarcasm, insults, and even coarse\nabuse, the outcome of absolute incredulity. However, to do them justice, I\nmust add that, a few days later, and with a courage that I can only describe\nas heroic, they returned to the charge, and succeeded in the very same towns\nin reversing public opinion, and in conquering afresh what I had just\ndeprived them of. I have often since reflected on this fact, and have found\nno explanation of it.\"\n\" Do you want an explanation, and would you be curious to see a genuine\nmagnetic, or rather somnambulic phenomenon ? \"\n\" That has long been my wish.\"\n\" Would you consent to accompany me and spare me a few moments of\nyour time 1\"\n\" Although I am very busy just now, nothing would give me greater\npleasure. \"\n\"Very well, I will not ask you, in the unlikely event of your being\nconvinced, if you would have the honesty to acknowledge it and further to\nsubscribe to your convictions ; I will not ask you to do so, for I already read\nin your face the entire frankness of your reply.\"\n\"Rest assured, Monsieur; in that case you will have no cause to be\ndissatisfied with me.\"\n\" It will be delightful then to show the savants, whom we were speaking\nof just now, that love of truth has flown to you for refuge. But don't\nforget to bring with you some cards (orthodox ones, mind, not yours), a\nbook, some hairs, etc., in fact anything which could best contribute to 6ettle\nyour convictions.\"\n\"Have no fear. I know what I'm about. Can Madame Houdin come\nwith us ? \"\n\" Most certainly.\"\n\" All right, I will come back at one o'clock to fetch you.\"\n2 c\n\f37G [Suppkteeat\nAlfred R. Wallace.\nIt was then 12 o'clock, and when I got into my carriage, R. Houdin\nheard me give the address of 42, Rue de la Victoire for the first timt. I\nhave underlined the words \"\/or the first time,\" because there are plenty\nof magnetisers in Paris, and nothing having intimated beforehand our choice\nof one more than another, there could have been no time to foresee or to\nforestall that choice.\nOn the way the future neophyte employed all the resources of his\ndialectic (no difficult task in such cases) to prove to me what he con\nsidered as self-evident, namely, that it was all a question of dodges more\nor less elaborate, and of a repertoire better \" staged \" chan the average.\n... At the moment of our arrival the oracle is performing in the\nadjoining room for the benefit of several people. Presently one of theiu\n(M. Prosper G 1) comes out, greatly impressed by having just been\ngiven a description of his country house, situated at the opposite extremity\nof France, down to the series of pictures hanging in his bedroom. Further\nthan this, after a description of all the out-houses, stables, and finally of the\ndog kennel, M. G 1 had added :\n\" Could you tell me the name of the powerful animal that sleeps in the\nkennel ? \"\n\"His name is\u2014wait\u2014his name's Es . . Esterl\u2014and it's the name of\nthe guide who got him for you.\"\nHere we, too, found ourselves on familiar ground ; for who does nut\nknow Esterl, the smartest and wiliest of all the Eaux Bonnes guides 1\nI have often passed several hours together in Marcillet's salon, amusiria;\nmyself with the kind of stupefaction (there is no other word for it) stamped\non the faces of the sitters, very different from the expression which they\nwore on entering.\nEvidently, it had required very personal and private revelations to upset\nthem to such a degree. But I was fonretting that the persons who attended\nthere one after another, from morning to night, were, one and all, primed\naccomplices.\nHowever, to return to the investigation of M. Houdin, who is now face\nto face with Alexis.\nAlexis exhibits on waking the drawn features, the peculiar look, ami\nneurotic stamp so characteristic of somnambulists, which alone would he\namply convincing to a doctor's eye. Then gradually the face regains its\ncomposure, the colour returns, until on being put to sleep again by hi<\nmagnetiser by means of a simple pressure of the arm, a slight and barely\nperceptible convulsion once more shakes his whole system, and plunges him\ninto a somnambulic state.\nRobert Houdin, who is an adept in such matters, asks leave to bandage\nAlexis' eyes himself. After a careful examination of the wadding and the\nenormous silk handkerchiefs that were handed to him, he covers the whole\nof the subject's face with the wadding. But after folding two of the hand\nkerchiefs over the rolls of cotton wool, which enveloped the face as though\nit were a most precious statuette, and which from the top of the forehead to\nbelow the lips did not allow of the very tiniest opening, he declined to use\nthe third, and did not require, as certain doctors do, a complete mask. The\nreason being that R. Houdin knows his business and the Prince of Conjurors\n\fPart xxxv.) . De Mirville on Houdin and Alexis. 377\ndoes not bother about such trifles. These two most suspicious eyes once\nwell encased in wadding and covered with bandages, with all the chinks\nstopped up, so to speak, R. Houdin drew from his pocket two packs of cards\nstill in their wrappers with the Government stamp intact, opened them,\nshuffled and asked Alexis to cut. He does so, and, I must admit, does so\nin some special way, which I do not remark, but which brings a passing\nsmile to the lips of the expert observer. It is clear that Robert Houdin\nhas noticed something, and thinks he recognises the trick, and any one\nbut myself would have trembled for the success of the experiment.\nNevertheless he lays down five cards before his opponent, who takes good\ncare not to touch them, gives himself five and is just going to pick them\nup, when Alexis stops him with the words : \"You needn't do that. I take\nevery trick,\" and names the ten cards which are still lying on the table face\ndownwards.\n\"Let us begin again,\" says R. Houdin coldly, stunned though he was, as\nif by a heavy blow.\n\" With pleasure.\"\nTen fresh cards are substituted for the first lot, and this time there was\nno smiling.\n\"I discard,\" says R. Houdin.\n\" Why do you keep these two cards, and this very weak trump too ? \"\n\" Never mind, give me three more.\"\n\" Here they are.\"\n\" What are they ? \" says Houdin, covering them with both hands.\n\" Queen of Diamonds, Queen of Clubs, and eight of Clubs.\"\n\"Go on, a third round.\"\nSame accuracy and infallibility.\nIt is now my turn to watch, and what do I see ?\nR. Houdin fixes Alexis with those remarkable eyes of his ; he changes\ncolour, his face grows livid, and a kind of nervous quiver passes over his\nfeatures, and then, with the passionate excitement of an artist who suddenly\nrecognises his master, cries,\n\" What is this 1 What's happening 1 It is splendid.\"\nThen, as used to happen in the Chamber after a fine speech, the sitting\nis perforce suspended for a time. A fresh start is made, and R. Houdin,\nafter taking off the somnambulist's useless bandages, draws a book of his\nown from his pocket, and asks him to read eight pages further on, starting\nfrom a given place. Alexis pricks the page two thirds of the way down with\na pin, and reads, Apres cette triste ceremonie.\"\n\" Stop,\" says R. Houdin, \" that's enough. I will look.\"\nNothing like it on the eighth page, but on the next page at the same\nheight are these words, \" Apres cette triste ceremonie.\"\n\"That's enough,\" says Houdin. \"What a marvel! Can you tell me\nwho wrote me this letter ? \" Alexis feels it, puts it on the top of his head,\nand against his stomach, and describes the writer fairly accurately, but he\nmakes what a doctor would call mistakes. Trifling mistakes, however ; for\ninstance, he is mistaken as to the shade of the hair, and as to his profession,\ncalling him a librarian, because he sees him surrounded by books. Briefly,\nerrors of detail, such as somnambulists are constantly being forced to.\n2 c 2\n\f378 Alfred R. Wallace.\ncommit when too closely pressed. . . . R. Houdin does not allow these\nerrors of detail to stop him, and, returning to the subject of the letter,\nasks : \" Where does it come from ? \"\n\" From \"\n\"Ah,\" says R. Houdin, \"and the postmark. I never thought of that.\nBut since you see this house, can you tell me in what street it stands I \"\n\"Wait. Give me a pencil.\" After five minutes' reflection, he wrote\nrapidly, \"Rue d'A , Number .\" \"This is too much, says R.\nHoudin. '\"It's beyond me. I don't want any more. One word more,\nthough. What is the writer of the letter doing at this moment ? \"\n\" What is he doing ? Take care. Be on your guard. He is betraying\nyour confidence at this very moment.\"\n\" Oh I that is an utter mistake,\" says Houdin,\" \" for the writer is one of\nmy best and most trusted friends.\"\n\"Take care,\" repeats Alexis, this time in an oracular tone, \"he is\ndeceiving you shamefully.\"\n\" Nonsense, \" 1 replies Houdin.\nMadame Houdin now takes a turn at asking questions.\n\"Could you tell me, Monsieur, what I am thinking of at this moment?'\n\"Give me your hand. What are you thinking of? Wait. You are\nthinking of a child, of a very young child. Ah ! poor mother, how sorry I\nam for you ! \"\nMadame Houdin, who, so far, had endeavoured to keep a smiling\ncountenance in order to mislead him, sheds a few tears.\n\" But, Monsieur, you can see him, then ! \"\n\" Yes. He died on the 15th of last July.\"\n\"At what o'clock ?\"\n\"Four o'clock in the morning.\"\n\"At Paris?\"\n\" No. Three leagues from Paris. Wait. Ah ! It was too late.\"\n\" What do you mean ? \"\n\" I mean that you changed the wet nurse too late. You know that\nwell ; the child was poisoned by the first nurse's milk. The poor woman\nwas very ill. \"\n\"Oh ! that's quite true, quite accurate. And could you tell me what I\nam thinking of now ? \"\n\"Alas! You're thinking of a still younger child, for it is not yet\nalive. \"\nThis was as a matter of fact the subject of Madame Houdin's thoughts,\nwhose maternal hopes were anticipating the future. Thereupon Alexis,\nseeing me writing in a pocket-book, snatches it from my hands, places it\nquickly on his head and reads from it two or three lines written in pencil,\nwhich we find on the page named.\n1 We hasten to add that last year, on my paying another visit to Robert Houdin,\nin company with my friend, M. Lacordaire, Manager of the Gobelins Manufactory\nhis first words were: \"You remember, Monsieur, the famous letter of my friend,\nliving at , and my repeated denials to Alexis.\" \"Yes.\" \"Well, this wretched\nfriend was robbing me of 10,000 francs at the very time of the sitting.\" It will be\nadmitted that this development has given a more serious turn to the matter.\n\fPart xxxv.] De MirvUle on Hoiulin and Alexis. 379\nA curious thing then occurred, which we submit to the consideration of\npersona interested in this inexplicable agency. In the pocket-book was a\nloose object.\n\"What is it, Alexis?\"\n\"A piece of cardboard.\"\n\"Yes, but what exactly is the cardboard ? \"\n\"I don't know; it is surrounded by little short engraved lines, but I\ndon't know what they are.\"\n\" Try hard. It isn't difficult ; a piece of cardboard in a pocket-book.\"\n\" Wait. It's a large visiting card\u2014a card on which steel pens are dis\nplayed for sale\u2014a tradesman's address.\"\nNothing of the kind, and the capricious faculty of the somnambulist\ncould not succeed in guessing an almanac. A certain doctor of my\nacquaintance would have been triumphant and have quickly closed the\nsitting as usual. We continued.\n\" And the paper next to it ? \"\n\"The one folded in four ? \" %\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Oh, that's very different and not difficult. 'Receipt of MM. Saquier\nand Bray, booksellers, 64, Rue des Saints-Peres, for 15 francs, 20 cents. '\"\nR. Houdin opens the paper and verifies the correctness of this state\nment. Astonishment greater than ever. On second thoughts, however,\nhe says :\u2014\n\" As far as I'm concerned this is not evidence, Monsieur, for I have not\nthe honour of your acquaintance, and though I am, personally, convinced\nthat you are not in league with the somnambulist, yet I must act as though\nyou were so on this occasion. Allow me then to confine myself to matters\nwithin my own personal knowledge, and to make one last experiment.\n\" To whom does this hair belong ? \"\n\" To a young man.\"\n\" Who may that be?\"\n\" Your son.\"\n\" What age ?\"\n\" Three years less than you allow him to be.\"\n\" True. What is he suffering from I He is ill.\"\n\"Yes. He suffers much pain in the right side. But wait. You have\njust touched these hairs, and I have made a confusion in the fluids. It's\nyou who are suffering in the right side, and at this very moment.\"\n\"That's quite true ; but how about my son ? \"\n\" Your son 1 He has nothing the matter with him.\"\n\"Yes, he has. Try again; there's something wrong with him. Don't\nyou see anything ? \"\nAlexis feels himself all over, moving his hand over his legs, stomach,\nheart, chest, and head, but perceives nothing.\n\" Try again.\"\n\" Ah ! I've got it. But do you mean to say you worry about that ?\nAbout this faint little speck that I can just see on the right extremity of the\nright eye ?

Your son, I tell you, is in perfect health. He's now\nsixteen years and three months old ; at eighteen it will have disappeared.\"\n\"It's astounding,\" exclaims R. Houdin. \" That's enough. Let us go\naway. Wake him up.\"\nMarcillet breathes upon the somnambulist's face, tho nervous symptoms\nwhich accompanied the entrancement reappear, but in reversed order, the\nvital functions gradually resume their ordinary course, and finally the\nmedium returns completely to his ordinary every-day existence.\nThe two investigators withdrew in silent astonishment, and on reaching\nthe street, I said :\u2014\n\" Well, what about jugglery ? \"\n\"Monsieur, if the world contained a juggler capable of performing such\nmiracles, he woidd, qua juggler, astound me a thousand times more than the\nmysterious agent whom you have just shown me.\"\n\" If you like I will take you straight away to see ten others, and you will\nwitness more or less the same phenomena.\"\n\"I assure you that there is no necessity.\"\n\" I can rely then on your keeping your promise.\"\n\" I am a man of my word, Monsieur, and no base promptings of self-\ninterest or of vanity will have any effect on me.\"\n\" Quite so, and the moment I saw you I never doubted your good faith.\nBut explain to me then why you smiled when the cards were cut before the\nfirst hand of eearte.\"\n\"I merely thought I noticed a coincidence between the cards cut and the\nnumber of cards required.\"\n\" But I always hear it said that your games of ecarte and those of Alexis\nare as like as two peas.\"\n\"Ah ! Monsieur, that may seem so to a man of no experience in these\nmatters, to the ordinary person, (though even then such a mistake is hardly\nadmissible), but to the expert '\u2014Just consider, Monsieur, that all my cards\nare faked, marked, often of unequal sizes, or at least artistically arranged.\nAgain, I have my signals and telegraphs. But in this case a fresh pack was\nused, which I had just taken out of its wrapper, and which the somnambu\nlist cannot have studied. There is another point, where deception is\nimpossible, namely, in the handling of the cards : in the one case, the entire\nartlessness of the performance, in the other, that tell-tale air of effort which\nnothing can entirely disguise, Add to that his total blindness, for need I\ninsist on the impossibility\u2014the absolute impossibility\u2014of his having seen.\nBesides, even supposing he could see, how can m account for the other\nplienomena ?

I went to this seance fully determined to\nkeep a careful watch on the game of ecarte, which had astounded me so\nmuch before. This time I took much greater precautions than at the first\nseance ; for distrusting myself I took with me a friend, whose natural\nimperturbability enabled him to form a cool judgment and helped to steady\nmine. I append an account of what took place, and you will see that\ntrickery could never have produced such results as those which I am about\nto recount. I undo a pack of cards, which I had brought with me in a\nmarked wrapper to guard against another pack being substituted for it. I\nshuffle, and it's my deal. 1 deal with every precaution known to a man well\nup in all the dodges of his profession. It's all of no use, Alexis stops me,\nand pointing to one of the cards that I had just placed in front of him on the\ntable, says :\n\" ' I've got the king.'\n\"'But you can't possibly know yet; the trump card has not been\nturned up.'\n\"' You'll see,' he replies.

The game was continued in an odd enough manner, for he\ntold me the cards that I had to play, though my cards were hidden under the\ntable and held close together in my hands. To each lead of mine he played\none of his own cards without turning it up, and it was always the right card\nto have played against mine.

(The Psychological Review, Nov. 1898.)\nThis article by Professor Patrick, which is to some extent a\nReview of Dr. Hodgson's Report on Mrs. Piper's trance-phenomena,\n(S.P.R. Proceedings, Part XXXIII.), although not throwing much new\nlight on the problems at issue, is, nevertheless, a very welcome utteranct-.\nFor we have here, in one of the foremost psychological journals of the\nUnited States, a strong appeal to experimental psychologists to occupy\nthemselves with the phenomena of automatism. The fact is, as Professor\nPatrick delicately hints, that there are a great many experimental psycholo\ngists in America,\u2014solidly established in a great many \" psycho-physical\nlaboratories,\"\u2014and that they are not all of them precisely overwhelme.1\nwith important jobs to do. \"It has been felt,\" says Professor Patrick,\n\" that to maintain the dignity of experimental psychology, this subject and\ncertain related ones must be ignored\u2014they have been almost uniformly\nkept out of American psychological laboratories, where infinite labour has\nbeen spent upon other probably less fruitful problems. But experimental\npsychology has now long passed its probationary period, and may quite\nfreely choose its subjects for research ; and at present there is perhaps no\nother subject promising to throw more light upon certain dark chapters in\nmental science than that of automatism.\" Some of my readers may\nremember my often expressed hope that the generation of young American\nsavants, whom psychology attracts, would some day let some of those\n\" probably less fruitful problems\" wait a little, and make n methodical\nattack upon the problems which a very few very busy persons have been\ngradually eliciting out of the mixedness of things for organised Science to\ndeal with as best she may. That is what we pioneers desire ;\u2014 the repetition\nof our experiments, the discussion of our provisional conclusions, with\ndiligence and competence ;\u2014no matter how much or how little credit may\nbe allowed to our own work. What we do not want, on the other hand (to\nspeak at least for myself), is the hasty adherence, the facile eulogy which,\nindolently assuming that all we have even conjectured is positive truth, uses\nour Proceedings as a foundation for all kinds of whimsical speculations,\nwithout a particle of fresh work or fresh experiment to support them. For\nheaven's sake, I would say, do not accept our conclusions too easily ; revise\nour methods and improve them if you can ; re-travel again and again the\nearly stages of our road ! All this is needful, if a number of able young men\n(in whom is our hope !) are to feel that the subject is, indeed, their mm ;\u2014a\nsubject which they have pursued from its beginning, and in which they\nmean to make their mark.\n\fP\u00bbrt XXXV.] Review.\nJust of the required type, as it seems to me, is this {taper of Professor\nPatrick's. He is not, of course, convinced of the agency of spirits of the\ndead (and I for one desire no easy convictions !) ; but he puts the questions\nwhich suggest themselves to all of us in a clear way, and he has himself\nmade experiments of a kind to us familiar, in automatic writing. I quote\nhis concluding passage, which may serve as the text for some brief\ncomment :\u2014\n\"As regards the various traits of the secondary personality, some of\nwhich have been referred to in this paper, it has been suggested by Mr.\nPodmore and others that they are instances of survival or reversion. One\ncannot indeed fail to be impressed by the similarity of these traits to what\nwe know or conjecture about the primitive mind. The general low moral\nand intellectual tone of the communications, the vulgarity and mild profanity,\nthe frequent impersonation of the medicine-man, Quaker doctor, Indian\ndoctor, etc., the keen memory and dull reason, the vivid constructive\nimagination, the deception and prevarication, the unwavering belief in\nspiritism, and the superstitious devotion to amulets, trinkets, and petty\narticles of ornament or apparel, all point to an early stage in the evolution\nof mind. Even the peculiar intuitive power sometimes exhibited by the\nsecondary personality may be compared to the superior intuition of woman,\nwhose mental peculiarities are in general representative of the more stable,\nbasal and abiding phenomena of mind. Both may point to some nearly extinct\nfaculty no longer serviceable. Still other peculiarities suggest the same\ntheory, such as the extreme suggestibility and motor force of ideas, marks of\nautomatism and of the hypnotic state, and at the same time characteristic of\nthe child and savage mind. In close relation to this is the peculiar intimate\nconnection between ideas and organic, nutritive and circulatory processes,\nbest shown in hypnosis, and common to this group of phenomena. In view\nof such facts as these, certain of the more simple physiological theories of\ndouble personality gain considerable plausibility, such, for instance, as the\nrevival of disused and outgrown brain tracts, particularly perhaps those of\nthe less specialised hemisphere. The frequent appearance in automatic\nwriting of Spiegelnchrift, which occurs also among children, lends some\nsupport to this view.\"\nI will endeavour to disentangle from this resume some elements, as it\nseems to me, both of truth and of error :\u2014\n(1) \"General low moral and intellectual tone.\" I think that this very\nfrequent criticism of automatic utterances depends largely on a misapprehen\nsion, which mistakes baffled effort and incoherence for lownt ss or savagery.\nThe so-called Phinuit, for instance, who has been much attacked on this line,\ndid undoubtedly fish for information and pretend to possess information,\n(though how far with definite intent to deceive, I cannot say), and did\nundoubtedly talk in the slangy, tiresome style of a man who has a very\npoor vocabulary at his disposal. But so far as I heard him, or heard of\nhim, he was neither immoral nor stupid. On the contrary, he gave much\nadvice on private and delicate matters ; and that advice, so far as I heard\nit, was always both shrewd and kindly. 1 feel bound to say this : since\nfrom having often acted as amanuensis in Phinuit's days, I have heard many\ncriticisms and admonitions of his, which naturally did not appear in printed\n\f384 F. W. H. Myers.\nreports. Professor W. James and Professor Lodge, who also heard much\nof this intimate talk of Phinuit's, will, I think, agree in this view.\n(2) The \" mild profanity \" of which Professor Patrick speaks is,\nin my experience, so mild that I confess that it has never succeeded in\nshocking me. The pencil, or planchette, will sometimes, as though in\nfatigued impatience, write devil, dent\u2014just as it will write no, no, or\nyes, yes, or Mary, Mary. This means, I think, a mere inability to use\nthe instrument (whatever the real instrument may be '.) in any but rudi\nmentary fashion. But if the word devil is received by bystanders as\nmysterious and interesting, the incoherent intelligence (whatever the\nTeal incoherent intelligence may be !) may even pluck up spirit to add\nthe word d h. Ignore the rubbish and it ceases to appear. But.\nindeed, in my view, the sources of automatic writings (confining ourselves\nto cases of genuine automatism) are far from being one. They may, e.g.,\noriginate in the subliminal self of the medium, or in the minds of still\nembodied other human beings present or absent, acting telepathically on the\nsubliminal self of the medium, or from spirits, and there may be. and,\nin my opinion, in most cases usually is, an admixture of these various\ninfluences.\n(3) \" The unwavering belief in spiritism.\" Are we not in some danger\nof question,begging if we treat this belief as an indication of reversion to\nsavage conceptions, when the actual problem is really whether that belief he\ntrue or no ?\n(4) \"Superstitions, devotion to amulets,\" etc. I have nothing to say for\namulets!\u2014but I think that what Professor Patrick really alludes to here is\nPhinuit's custom of asking for ' hair cut close to the head, or old hat-linings,\"\n\u00abs a way of getting \" into the atmosphere\" of the former wearers of hat or\nhair. Now, one might well wish to be summoned from the realms of day by\nsome appeal more attractive than the posthumous traces of one's having\nworn a particular cricket-cap on a hot afternoon. But if the immaterial and\nthe material worlds are really continuous, it is conceivable that what has been\nclosest to the living brain may retain the most perceptible earthly indication\nof that special personality. We are dealing here with an empirical suggestion\nrather than with a traditional superstition.\n(5) \" In peculiar intuitive power,\" etc. This sentence seems to be a\nmere play on the word intuitive. A woman, say, with delicate half-conscious\nobservation, and without formal reasoning, might have discovered (although\nKmma did not) that Frank Churchill was somehow secretly linked with Jane\nFairfax. This would be called feminine intuition ; but such a guess is\nabsolutely different from the bits of knowledge which really need explaining\nin these trance utterances ;\u2014the utterance, say, of the names of dead\n,strangers, to which nothing has led up. A woman is no better able than a\nman to tell you straight out the Christian name of your grandfather. There\nis nothing \"stable, basal, and abiding\" about such intuitions as that.\n(6) And here I may touch on the general question as to whether these\nsupernormal powers,\u2014telepathy and telnesthesia,\u2014are instances of \"'survival\nor reversion \" ;\u2014reversion to primitive ancestors, survival of \" some nearly\nextinct faculty no longer serviceable.\" I cannot understand the view of\nprotoplasmic evolution here implied. Protoplasm (as the text-books tell us)\n\fPart XXXV.] 385\nReview.\nfrom its primary inexplicable irritability gradually develops specific sensibili\nties, in response to specific stimuli, and by the survival of individuals best\nfitted to secure food and to escape enemies. Thus faculty rises from touch\nand smell, which act near at hand, to sight, which acts at great distances.\nAt what point would the struggle for existence develop, say, the power of\nsymbolically cognising the death of a kindred individual beyond the range\nof sight 1 Such a faculty would be profoundly indifferent to a hedgehog or\na crab. How could a savage acquire it f and of what use would it be to\nhim i I am not aware that, except by a few Psychical Researchers, the gift\nis particularly valued even now.\nOf course this line of argument takes us further still. I frankly find it\ninconceivable that at any period of man's history, this faculty of far-feeling,\nthis cognisance of distant minds, should have been developed by the actual\nneed and stress of earthly existence. I can imagine no gift which, for the\nordinary purposes of living and propagating, would be either more unpractical\nor more unattainable. \"Conscience,\" says Huck Finn, \"takes up more\nroom than all the rest of a person's insides, and yet ain't no good, nohow.\"\nIf the moral sense acquired by our race after long and painful tribal training,\nthus often appears worse than useless to its possessor, what should we say of\nthe policy of acquiring a faculty incomparably more elaborate and expensive\nthan sight itself, whose upshot is to give its owner an occasional peep at\na ghost ? The case might be changed, could we show that savage races\nhabitually acted \\oilh adeantaye on messages given through medicine men.\nI doubt, however, whether those messages are more often of practical use to\nthem than trance utterances are to us.\nBut, in truth, to a deeper gaze, the problem of telepathy shows itself as\nsomething quite apart from questions of earthly use or advantage. Telepathy,\nin my own view, involves an opening out of inner vision, bearing a relation\ndifferent from that borne by any human sense, certainly to space, and perhaps\nto time. It involves a communicfitio idiomatum, \u2014& contact and converse of\nminds as minds, different altogether from any known contact or converse of\norganisms. It belongs primarily,\u2014as I needs must think,\u2014to an environ\nment quite other than that we know. It may be a vestige, a survival ; but,\nif so, it is the vestige of prenatal faculty, the survival of something which\nexisted in the universe before the individualisation of incarnate man.\n(7) And now a few concluding words as to the possible preferential use\nof the right cerebral hemisphere in automatic messages. This suggestion\nwas, I believe, first made by our valued correspondent, the late Rev. P. H.\nNewnham, who was struck with peculiarities, very unlike his wife's\ncharacter, in certain messages which both he and Mrs. Newnham believed\nto proceed ultimately from some stratum of her mind. I developed this\nhypothesis in a long paper in Proceedings, Vol. III., p. 1 (January, 1885),\ndwelling especially on the rather frequent occurrence of mirror-writing\n(Spiegelschrift) in automatic script, as a clear indication of dextro-cerebral\npreponderance where it occurred. The suggestion was coldly received at the\ntime, but in some recent papers in Brain and elsewhere I observe that\nthe idea of an oscillation between the two hemispheres, as regards pre\nponderance in verbalisation, is again renewed. And to me it seems that\nmany automatic messages received since I first wrote\u2014and those of Mrs.\n\f3*6 [Supplement\nE. W. Taylor.\nPiper's especially\u2014do increasingly suggest a difficult or makeshift usage of \u00bb\nhuman brain. The brain may conceivably be thus used in a makeshift\nway either by a subliminal stream of consciousness or by an external\nintelligence. On the assumption that there is an invading intelli\ngence, that intelligence (as Dr. Hodgson somewhere says) is employing\na kind of imperfect typewriter ;\u2014which, one may add, is also an erratic\ncalculating machine\u2014you drop your thoughts into it. and some of them\ncome out somehow. But the machine has holes in it ;\u2014places where the\nthoughts which the spirit puts in drop through ineffectively ;\u2014and it has als\u00bb\nstrains or cramps in it ;\u2014places where it has got set or stuck in a way which\nthe spirit cannot alter. This last fact resembles the well-known difficulty in\nthe way of miking therapeutic suggestions to a hysteric. She has already\ngiven henelf such strong suggestions on certain points that no counter-\nsuggestions of ours can shake her.\nNow, I think it possible that our left hemispheres, having been more\nconstantly used than our right hemispheres, may be more crowded anil\nblocked (so to say) with our own already fixed ideiis. An external\nintelligence, wishing to use my brain, might find it convenient to leave\nalone those more educated but also more preoccupied tracts, and to use the\nless elaborated, but less engrossed, mechanism of my right hemisphere.\nIf this be thus, we should have here a striking instauce of light thrown\nupon our own being by the procedure of beings almost incredibly remote. Bu\".\nthis would not surprise me. As I have elsewhere remarked, such an incident\nwould resemble the light thrown upon the elements which constitute our\nfamiliar earth by spectroscopic analysis of the radiance of distant suns. It\nwould be another step in the reconstruction of what once seemed so\nsolid and self-contained\u2014what now seems so diffused and unseizable\u2014the\npersonality of man.\n\" Humpty Dumpty \"\u2014the Self, totus teres at^ne rotundns\u2014\"sat on the\nwall\" of the old psychology. \" Humpty Dumpty has had a great falL \"\n\"Not all the King's horses nor all the King's men\"\u2014nay, not the allied\nbattalions of the Great Republic\u2014\"can set Humpty Dumpty up again.'\nYet they may find, perhaps, that only his shell is broken, and that some\nthing has somehow hatched out of him which, instead of sitting on his wall,\nwill fly over it. p w H Mysj&\nThe PsycJiolotiy of Suggestion: A Research into the Subconscious Nature of Man\nand Society. By Boris Sidis, M.A., Ph.D., Associate in Psychology\nat the Pathological Institute of the New York State Hospitals. With\nan introduction by Professor William Jambs, of Harvard University\u2022\npp. X. +33(5. New York : D. Appleton and Co., 1898.\nThe book before us is a type of work which should be encouraged. It is\nan attempt to establish on a basis of observation and experiment facts which\nhave too long suffered from the failure to apply to them exact methods.\nThe general subject of subconsciousness, with which the author deals, is\nnaturally elusive, and capable of varied interpretations. It is for this\nreason that it demands our most unprejudiced and exacting research, in the\n\fPart XXXV.] 387\nReview.\nlight of recent advances in the anatomy and physiology of the nervous\nsystem. This is Sidis's attitude towards the problem he has undertaken to\nsolve ; he is critical throughout his discussion, excepting where demands for\nexplanation of psychical facts lead him too definitely to the assumption\nof underlying physical causes, as, for example, in his free adoption of the\nretraction theory.\nThe book is divided into three parts : Suggestibility ; the Self ; Society.\nEach of these demands consideration.\nAfter a brief discussion of the careless way in which the term \" sug\ngestion \" has come to be used, Sidis commits himself to the following\ndefinition (page 15) : \" By suggestion is meant the intrusion into the mind\nof an idea ; met with more or less opposition by the person ; accepted\nuncritically at last ; and realised unretlectively, almost automatically.\" It\nis evident that this definition will not pass wholly unchallenged. The fact\nof opposition is certainly not essential to suggestion ; not infrequently the\nmost powerful suggestion is that which is accepted uncritically at first, and\nto which not the slightest opposition is made.\nAn interesting series of experiments into the evidence of normal sug\ngestibility is given, from which the conclusion is drawn that normal\nsuggestibility exists as an undoubted fact, and that \"Man is a suggestible\nanimal, par excellence.\" Following this is a critical analysis of both normal\nand abnormal suggestibility, with a discussion of the hypnotic state, and\nillustrative cases, all of which constitutes an excellent, brief presentation\nof matters of vital concern both to the neurologist and psychologist. The\nresult of the analysis is that \" suggestibility is a disaggregation of con\nsciousness,\" in which the subconscious self enters into direct communication\nwith the external world, hence the general law :\u2014\" Suggestibility caries as the\namount of disaggregation, and inversely as the unification of consciousness.\"\nThe next section of the book is concerned with the \"Self.\" The\nargument already begun is carried to its conclusion, and the \u2022'subconscious\"\nis given a place of dignity in the realm of mind as a consciousness of relative\nindependence; \"it is a secondary consciousness, a secondary self.\" This\nconception Sidis reaches not by a priori methods, but by experiment with\nnumerous subjects both in and out of the hypnotic state. He places his two\npersonalities, as it were, side by side, and studies their character, their\nmethods of inter-communication, and their general inter-relations. This is\nextremely well done, and while constantly feeling that the problems are\nbeing stated in too diagrammatic a way, the reader cannot fail to see the\nforce of the argument, and the suggestiveness of its treatment. \"The\nProblem of Personality \" is the title of a chapter which is largely taken up\nwith an adverse criticism of Professor James,s theory of personality, and is of\ninterest to those whose concern is with the more metaphysical side of the\nquestion. We cannot pass over the chapter on \"The Physiology and\nPathology of Sub-conciousness,\" without a word of comment. Sidis here\nsketches very briefly the new anatomical theory of the nervous system, and\ncommits himself unhesitatingly to the so-called retraction theory. This\nchapter is superficial and dogmatic, and brings no adequate evidence in\nsupport of its position. A postulate so vague and so iucapable of demonstra\ntion as the retraction of neuron terminations should certainly be approached\n\f388 [Supplement.\nE. W. Taylor.\ntentatively and not dogmatically. Such allegiance to an unproved, and to\nmany minds fanciful theory, is not in accord with the spirit of scientific\nexactness, and repels the unprejudiced reader.\nThe author is on much safer ground when he discusses in the following\nchapter the case of a Rev. Thomas C. Hanna, in whom a complete amnesia\nfollowed an accident. The history of this case is worked out in admirable\ndetail, though given merely in outline. By means of a method which the\nwriter calls \" hypnoidization,\" he was able to prove that the patient had all\nhis lost memories stored in his subconscious mind, which could temporarily\nbe brought to the surface of consciousness. By degrees the two personalities,\nwhich had developed since the accident, were fused into one, and the patient\ncompletely cured. This case must be regarded as one of the most valuable\ncontributions which the book contains. Its practical bearing needs\nonly to be mentioned to be recognised. Much more regarding the sub\nconscious self is of great interest, as, for example, its characteristics, as\ndistinguished from the waking self, and its relations to insanity. These are,\nhowever, matters for which we must refer the interested reader to the teit\nfor further detail.\nThe volume concludes with a section on \"Society,\" in reference par\nticularly to social suggestibility. This is by all means the most entertaining\npart of the entire book, and is most cordially to be recommended to the\nstudent of social movements. The psychology of the mob and the crowd,\nand mental epidemics, are described in a highly original and graphic\nmanner. Some of the author's statements are extreme, and must be con\ndemned by a sober judgment, as, for example, (page 362) : \" American\nsociety oscillates between acute financial mania and attacks of religious\ninsanity\"; or (page 363), \"Woman cannot leave long the routine of her\nlife, the beaten track of mediocrity ; she can rarely rise above the trite :\nshe is a Philistine by nature.\" These and many other statements are un\nnecessarily sweeping, but the faults of these chapters are so inherently a\npart of their excellence that we refrain from further criticism. Were Sidis\nnot an extremist the chapters might better have been left unwritten. As it\nis, they are full of suggestiveness and undoubted truth, in spite of the\noccasional extravagance of expression.\nIn general, we have no doubt the book will fill a place and supply a\nwant. It has in a rare degree the qualities of originality and forcible\nexpression, tempered by a guarded scientific spirit, except in a certain\ntendency toward a too free acceptance of unproved theories of physiological\nnervous action. The author has done a good service, however, in stating\nclearly a doctrine of consciousness, and substantiating his claims by an\nappeal to experiment, which is likely to throw light on various morbid\nmental states, notably hysteria, and so indirectly on the nature of mind\nitself.\nAn introduction by Professor William James adds to the interest of the\nbook. It is noticeable that James is careful to avoid committing himself to\nSidis's views, while clearly recognising the intrinsic merit of his work.\nThe typography and general appearance of the book are excellent. It is\nembellished by a few illustrations and charts, which tend to make clear the\ntext, and has a good index. _ ~. _\n\fPart XXXV ] 389\nReview.\nNatarwissensclutftliche Seelenforschung. I.

Das Normale Beirusxtsein. Von Rudolf\nMuller. Leipzig. [1898.] pp. 173-322.\nIn this first instalment of his planned work the author seeks to sketch\nthe foundations of a scientific method of the investigation of mind, and of\nthe points of view from which it proceeds. (Vorrede VII.) The small pro\ngress of psychology beyond description to the real end of a science in\nexplanation is ascribed, in spite of the late great activity in psychological\nstudy and laboratories, to the want of courage in breaking from old\nprejudices and speculative theories. (V. and VI.) As against this the\nauthor's method needs no hypothetical presuppositions, and will give to\npsychological phenomena a real explanation in harmony with the other\nresults of exact investigation. (VII.)\nThe special interest of the book for our Society lies in the importance\nthe author attaches to hypnotism and telepathy as psychological methods of\ninvestigation. \"Even more than the successes of objective science, the\nhypnotic and occult phenomena have lately called forth a mental movement\nembracing ever wider circles, and which seeks to solve the riddle of the\nmind by an experimental investigation of these phenomena. Several\nlearned societies, foremost the ' Society for Psychical Research ' in London\nand the ' American Psychical Research ' in Boston, and numerous clubs of\nall civilised lands, are concerned with this kind of experimental study of\nmind, which direction has already found numerous zealous literary\nchampions. But here again the old fault has not been avoided, since the\ntemptation has been too little resisted of seeking the goal on the wings of\nuncertain speculation, instead of trusting alone to the gradual and slow,\nbut so much the surer, progress of experimental study No wonder that\nthe official representatives of psychology do not follow this flight. On the\nother hand, all honour is due to those few earnest psychological students\nwho have the courage to extend their investigations to the hypnotic and\u2014-\neven though in the beginning with caution and sceptical predisposition\u2014\nalso to the occult phenomena, and to use, not speculation, but observation\nand verification of facts and experimental methods.\" (VI. and VII.)\nThree divisions of psychology are made :\u2014(1) Psychical physiology ; (2)-\nPsychology in the narrow sense ; (3) Hypnology. (pp. 110-118.) It is the\nmethodology of hypnology with which the author is chiefly concerned, and\nwhich he believes will be of such great service to psychology in the narrow\nsense. Stimulated, apparently, by the suggestion of Miinsterberg,1 and by\nthe hypnotic experimental method of Dr. O. Vogt,2 the author extends this\nintrospection in hypnotism to the condition of clairvoyance in hypnotism.\n1 Aufyaljen und Mcthoden der Psychologic s. 120.\na Die direete Psycltologitche Expcrimcntal-mcthode in Hypnotischen Bewusstseinszu-\nstdnden, Leipzig, 1897 ; abstract in Proceedings of the Dritter InternaUonalcr Con\ngress fur Psychologic in Miinehen, s. 250-259.\n\f390 [Supple-nest.\nHarlow Gale.\nBut under clairvoyance seems to be included also thought-transference\n(pp. 152-3). The knowledge so reported is not to be taken with\nuncritical belief, but is to be proved and verified by the usual objective\nmethods (pp. 156-7). Thus three methods of hypnotic clairvoyant\nintrospection are made :\u2014(1) Introspecting self-observation ; (2) Intro\nspection of some third person put into rapport by the hypnotiser : (3)\nIntrospection of the hypnotiser. These three simple methods are also to be\nused in combination (pp. 158\u2014163.) The author has used these methods\nsome years (p. 154), and reserves for his second volume of this work \u00bb\ndetailed account of his clairvoyant experiments in hypnotism and their\nfoundation principles (pp. 139 and 158).\nYet from this introductory volume one has some glimpses of the\nauthor's own results and his real methods as compared with the above\nexcellent plan. For \" the fact of the existence of a subject, which is\ndenied by pure psychology, the Naturwixseitsciiaftiiche Sedenforschnng will\nundertake to prove\" (p. 14).1 Then specially, \" it is the truly astonishiiu;\neffects which come to light in the phenomena of hypnotism and clairvoyance\nwhich force us to recognise the real and actual existence of this something,\ncalled soul, within the human organism. . . . The psyche is nothing\nelse, and can be nothing else, than a force\" (p. 102). \"It must here be\nexpressly emphasised that under the idea of soul is not meant any spiritual\nsubstratum of life- and thought-force, but the force itself, i.e., that effective\nactivity, evidencing itself pre-eminently in the matter of the nervous\nsubstance, which produces the process of life and thought \" (pp. 102\nand 103). The Natuncissenschaftliche Seelenforschung has no other problem\nthan to investigate the laws of the changes effected by the soul-force\"\n(p. 108).\nIndeed, the discussion about this mental subject fills the greater part of\nthis present introductory book, and it does not seem possible to reconcile the\nauthor's different standpoints and reasonings. For though the study of the\nbrain mechanism as making possible and conditioning the mind is counted is\none of the most important problems (p. 132), and though hypnotic introspec\ntion reports \" without brain function, no consciousness \" (pp. 154 and lofi),\nyet the aim of physiological psychology in seeking to know the causal\nconnection of motions in the nerves, in the hope of ultimately inferring\ntherefrom the causal connection of mental processes, is considered a dream ;\nand were it even reached, it \" would neither satisfy our demands of know\nledge nor afford an explanation for psychical phenomena \" (p. 29 ; see\nalso pp. 99, 112, 146-7).\nThe fact appears to be that the author's \"subject\" has been antici]\u00bbt\u00abd\nin this methodology volume by being carried back from the subsequent\nmetaphysics to which he thinks all science leads. \"Force, and therewith\nalso matter, is physical ; the substratum of force, the subject of activity, is\nmetaphysical. . . . Since the subject of activity is metaphysical, so all\nbranches of science lead to a natural metaphysics as the real basis of all\nnatural reality \" (p. 52 ; see also pp. 12, 33, 109, 168). This attitude is\nshown in his vehement protest that Du Bois-Reymond and Helmholta have\n1 For a dramatic 6gure of the death of \"psychology without a soul,\" see p. 4.\n\fPart XXXV.] 391\nReview.\npoured out the child (life-force) with the bath,1 as compared with his highest\nadmiration for the work of Du Prel (pp. 106 and 120). However different\njudgments may vary as to the possibility or value of real knowledge leading\nultimately to any metaphysics, it is at any rate discouraging to find another\nauthor straying so soon from his scientific method.2\nIn the second instalment of this work the experimental results with a\nfemale clairvoyant medium are given ; yet only scattered direct quotations\nof the medium's descriptions, and no attempt is made at giving a full record\nof even one sitting. When asked to look into her own or the hypnotisor's\nbrain, the hypnotised medium, who was ignorant of such matters, gave the\nfollowing characteristic descriptions:\u2014\"There is so very much together,\nand all in movement and alive ; there and there and here something springs\nup, in many places at once, and then immediately again at other places, and\nthey are interwoven through and over one another,\u2014that is by no means\neasy to describe ! . . . . There are many and many little points like\npoppies, and thousands and thousands of little threads in which currents run\nforwards, backwards, from within upwards and downwards. This looks\nlike the foaming on pouring out soda-water or beer \" (p. 188). The author\nwondered if by these \"little poppy points\" was meant the pyramid and\nother nerve cells of the cortex, and considered these first descriptions so\ncorrect and exact, in spite of the primitive modes of expression, that his\nbeginning doubts gave way to confidence in the medium (p. 189). Asked\nwhat that springing up at so many places occasioned, she replied slowly,\n\" That makes thinking, speaking, hearing; for when I or you speak there\narise such\u2014how shall I name them ?\u2014 little bits of balls or knots, I might\nalmost say bubbles, but very small, now like the finest needle points, some\nlarger, some smaller, variously formed\" (pp. 189 and 190). Such popularly\nvague and figurative descriptions can be translated into almost any technical\nbrain language.\nHer scheme for the optic tract and chiasma is considered much more\nprobably right from its simplicity and naturalness (pp. 209 and 210).\nSensation is made out to be due to a double-sided fluctuation, resulting in a\ntension of the fibrillated nerve endings (p. 234), and consciousness from the\nunion in the cortex of the biochemical hunger from the cerebellum with the\npositive fluctuations from the sense organs (p. 235). The cerebellum is the\nstomach of the nervous system, in that it secretes the nutritive fluid which\nis taken into the nerves through the fibrillated endings, (pp. 212, 195.)\nWith her \"accustomed precision\" (p. 221) the heart is the seat of the\nfeelings (p. 220), being dark blue in bitterness and light red in joy (pp. 288\nand 291). Such fantastic anatomy and physiology is to be taken as true\nbecause it is not self-contradictory (p. 186). But in addition to this\ndeductive logical test of metaphysics, the author awaits experimental\nverification for the clairvoyant descriptions which he could not bring into\nharmony with the already acquired scientific knowledge (p. 286).\n1 Of.

Padova, 1898, pp. 150.\nThis \"summary exposition of real studies on the transmission of\nthought\" is a collection of the author's articles which have been appearing\nirregularly in the Rivista di Studi Psichici, edited by himself and Dr. G.\nFinzi. The sudden death1 of Dr. Ermacora a year ago has left these\narticles somewhat incomplete as a review of the subject. Yet the book as\nit stands is a most hopeful and valuable work. It is hopeful as an evidence\nitself of the progress of psychical research which the author sketches in his\nIntroduction. In this general progress it may be an encouragement to the\nworkers in the S.P.B. to find that nearly 60 per cent, of all the citations\nand references are from English sources.\nThe work deals only with the experimental evidence for telepathy. An\nexcellent introduction discusses the methods and the cautions against\nillusion and fraud. The evidence begins with the production of hypnotism\nat a distance and of telepathic perception in hypnosis. Before going on to\nthe experiments in the normal condition there is an interpolation of some\ntheoretical considerations on the various effects in telepathy. These are\nfortunately not concerned with speculations as to the means of telepathic\ntransmission, but with the forms in which the telepathic influence mamfest*,\nitself in the percipient. This analysis and classification gives the basis for\nthe subdivisions of the experimental evidence which follows. These\nremaining sections are :\u2014Alterations of function, perception of ideas,\nperception through internal sensory images, hallucinations hypnotic and\npost-hypnotic, dreams, waking hallucinations (with subdivision on\nhallucinations in general), emotions and alterations of personality, and\nmotor perceptions. The author left the titles only of two planned chapters\non post-hypnotic suggestions, and the phenomenon of so-called magnetic\nattraction.\nThe work then, as a complete review of the evidence for telepathy, is\nwanting in the spontaneous cases of veridical hallucinations, and in more\nthan a passing notice of the Census of Hallucinations. Strangely enough, too,\nthere is no reference to the mass of evidence in the case of Mrs Piper\n1 Noticed in the Journal S.P.R. for May, 189S, Vol. VIII., p. 224. See also thr\nRivitta di Studi Ptichici, Anno IV., pp. 103-108, for his portrait, and for a most\ninteresting sketch of his specialised education in physics, with his subsequent\nattraction and complete devotion of his means and leisure to psychical research.\n\fPart XXXV.] 393\nReview.\nThis oversight can hardly be intentional, because of her phenomena being\nclassed as \"clairvoyance,\" or because of their spiritistic form. For of his\nown very original and highly valuable study on dreams 1 produced through\nthe \"Elvira\" personality of Signorina Marie M., he said: \"It seems\nimportant to me to remark once for all that supposed spiritistic intervention\nis certainly able to become an important factor in explanations of telepathy,\nbut one ought not now to make a distinction a priori (and founded on simple\ndifference of form in phenomena) between messages transmitted by telepathy\nand messages transmitted by spirit intervention. We ought to remain\nbound to the definition adopted, according to which all communication\nbetween mind and mind that does not come by known sensory means is\ncalled telepathy.\" (La Telepatia, p. 74, note.) And as, against these\nomissions, the book offers only four cases which are not included in\nPhantasms of the Living or Mr. Podmore's Apparitions and Thought-Trans\nference, the work cannot be regarded as so complete and thorough a review\nof telepathy as Apparitions and Thought-Transference. The high admiration\nfor this work which Dr. Ermacora expressed in his thirteen-page review of\nit in the first number of his Eirisla 2 in January, 1895, and his desire for its\ntranslation, had apparently been preceded by his beginning this series of\narticles which made up La Telepatia. And probably his form of popularisa\ntion and critical education in this difficult subject may be more fitted to his\nown country and readers.\nThus, in spite of its more or less necessitated incompleteness, La Telepatia\nis a work of most timely and even permanent value, a worthy monument\u2014\ntogether with the three volumes of his Kivista\u2014to its open-minded, untiring,\nand scholarly author. It is surely to be greatly hoped that the work in its\ncollected form may hasten the renewed formation of an Italian Society for\nPsychical Research, to which the family of the author carry out his spirit in\ndedicating the income from this work.\nHarlow Gale.\nEssays in Psychical Research. By Miss X. (A. Goodrich-Fiiebr) (London :\nGeorge Redway. 1899. pp. XV., 330.)\nMiss Freer, who, under the name of \" Miss X.\", has made several\ncontributions to our Proceedings, tells us in the preface to this volume of\nessays that \"the papers which are here collected from various periodicals\nin which they have appeared, are in every sense essays in Inquiry,\" and she\nstates that she has \" no claim to the attention of others, but such as they\nmay grant to a lifelong experience of the phenomena under consideration.\"\nMiss Freer is indeed most at home in describing her own experiences and\ncommenting upon them, and is, I think, seen at her best in the article\nentitled \" How it came into my head. The Machinery of Intuitions \"\n\u2014which is substantially, as she reminds us, the reproduction of an article\n1 \"Telepathic Dreams Experimentally Induced.\" Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XI.,\npp. 235-308.\n2 See Dr. Leaf's notice of the Rivitta in Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XL, pp. 171\nand 172.\n2 d 2\n\f394 Richard Hodgson.\npublished in these Proceeding* (Part XXVII.) under the title of \"On the\nApparent Sources of Subliminal Messages.\" The other essays in the book\nare all reproduced\u2014with some slight changes by omission or addition or\nre arrangement, chiefly verbal in character\u2014 from articles by Miss X. which\nappeared in the magazine Borderland, published quarterly by Mr. VV. T.\nStead, the first number of which appeared in July, 1893, and the last, and\nexpiring, number in October, 1897.\nThe book, as a whole, is rather of the literary than the scientific order,\nand deals with the subjects under consideration in the somewhat popular\nmanner suitable to Borderland. This fact will doubtless make the present\nvolume more rather than less interesting to many readers. Besides the\narticle referred to above as republished from our Proceedings, the book con\ntains, in addition to the Introductory sketch of \" Psychical Research in the\nVictorian Era,\" papers under the following headings : \"Haunted Houses.\"\n\"Another Theory of Hauntings \" (really about \"The Land of Faery,\" as\nit was originally called in Borderland), \" On the Faculty of Crystal Gazing,\"\n\"The Divining Rod, or the Faculty of Dowsing,\" \"Hypnotism,\" \"Obses\nsion : or the Imperative Idea\" (about fads and idees fixes), \" Holywell\u2014\nPsychic Healing : The Welsh Lourdes,\" \" Saint Columba, the Father of\nSecond Sight.\"\nOf these articles, that on Crystal Gazing has special value owing to the\npractical experience of Miss Freer in this subject. On the Divining Rod,\nhowever, the reader will do well to refer to Professor Barrett's report\npublished in Part XXXII. Proceedings S.P.R. It is odd that Miss Freer\nmakes no reference to this in her book, although there are indications which\nsuggest that in revising her article from its original form in Borderland, she\nwas indebted for some of her new statements to that report. Of excellent\nreading is the account of Saint Columba, who, according to Adamnan\n(whom Miss Freer summarises), united various kinds of psychical gifts, from\n\"thought-transference and clairvoyance\" up to \"premonitions\" of things\nboth small and great. Many instances are quoted by Miss Freer, from\nwhich I take the following :\u2014\n\"The saint called two of the brethren, Lugbe and Silnan, and gave\nthem this charge : ' Sail over now to the Malean Island, and on the open\nground, near the seashore, look for Ere, a robber, who came alone last\nnight in secret from the Island Coloso. He strives to hide himself among\nthe sandhills during the daytime under his boat, which he covers with hay.\nthat he may sail across at night to the little island where our young seals are\nbrought forth and nurtured. When this furious robber hath stealthily\nkilled as many as he can, he then fills his boat and goes back to his hiding-\nplace.' They proceeded at once, in compliance with their orders, and found\nthe robber lying hid in the very spot that was indicated.\"\n', On another day a shout was given on the other side of the Sound.\nThe saint . . . said : ' The man who is shouting beyond the Sound is\nnot of very sharp wits, for when he is here to-day he will upset my inkhorn\nand spill the ink.' Diormit, his minister, hearing this, stood a little in front\nof the door, and waited for the arrival of this troublesome guest, in order\nto save the inkhorn. But for some cause or other he had soon to leave hU\nplace, and after his departure the unwelcome guest arrived. In his eager\n\fPart XXXV.] 395\nReview.\nhaste to kiss the saint, he upset the inkhorn with the hem of his garment\nand spilled the ink.\"\n\" One day S. Coluraba was sitting by a well near the fortress of Cethirn\nwith Abbot Coragell. Water was brought to them to wash their hands, and\nthe saint said to the abbot : ' A day shall come, O Comgell, when the well\nwhence this water now poured out for us was drawn will be no longer fit for\nman's use.' 'How shall the water of this be defiled?' said the abbot. 'From\nthis,' answered the saint, 'that it shall be filled with human blood; for thy\nrelatives and mine\u2014that is, the people of the Cruithni and the race of\nNiall\u2014shall be at war in the neighbouring fortress of Cethirn. At this well\nan unhappy relative of mine shall be slain, and his blood, mingling with\nthat of many others, shall fill it up.' An old man present at the battle,\nmany years after, referred to this prophecy, and pointed out its literal\nfulfilment in the dead bodies in the well and the death of S. Columba's\nkinsman.\"\nWith so much that is of interest in this collection of Borderland articles,\nit is to be regretted that Miss Freer has repeated an important misrepre\nsentation of fact concerning Mrs. Piper, my correction of which had been\npreviously brought to her attention. She gives her readers to understand\n(pp. X. and 21) that Mrs. Piper's trances involve \"the extreme cost of\npersonal suffering,\" and she speaks of \"the convulsed countenance, the\ngnashing teeth, the writhing body, the clenched hands.\" Miss Freer gave\nutterance to similar remarks at a meeting in London, reported in the\nmagazine Light, for December 17th, 1898. In a communication to the same\nmagazine for February 4th, 1899, I pointed out that her assertions on this\nmatter were entirely baseless. I drew attention to the fact that \"the con\nvulsive movements which usually in past years marked Mrs. Piper's going\ninto and coming out of trance \" had ceased two years previously, and I\nreferred to the statements which I had already made to this effect in the\nJournal S. P. R. for January, 1898 (p. 167) and in the Proceedings S. P. R.,\nPartXXXUI, February, 1898 (p. 403). I also emphasised the fact that\nMrs. Piper's trances did not involve any personal suffering by quoting a\nstatement from Mrs. Piper herself that she had never suffered any physical\npain in connection with her trances, and that during the past two years she\nhad experienced better health than before since she was thirteen years old.\nIt is therefore surprising to find that Miss Freer in the volume before us\nrepeats her misrepresentation, and to find further that the latest words\nwhich I have quoted above (from the paper on \" Psychical Research in the\nVictorian Era,\" p. 21), do not occur in the original paper in borderland\n(July, 1897). Miss Freer is evidently labouring under an idee fixe, which\nperhaps began between two and three years ago, and has become more\nstrongly established since. That this is the explanation of her curious mis\nstatements may appear to the reader who will compare what she says about\nMrs. Piper in the book before us (as well as in her remarks reported in\nLight for December 17th, 1898) with what she wrote in Borderland for\nJanuary, 1894,\u2014\" Character Sketch. Mrs. Piper\"\u2014and for July, 1896,\u2014\n\" The Progress of Psychical Research. Professor James's Address.\" (Miss\nFreer's sittings with Mrs. Piper, it should be noted, were as long ago as\nDecember 7th to 9th, 1889.) Not only, in these articles, is there not the\n\f306 [Supplement\nWm. Romaine Newbold.\nslightest reference of any kind whatsoever to any personal suffering of Mrs.\nPiper, but it will be very plain to the reader that no thought of any such\nsuffering had entered Miss Freer's mind ; and it seems that as late as July.\n18%, Miss Freer wrote as follows, after quoting Professor James's now\nfamous remark that his own white crow was Mrs. Piper : \" It is well known\nthat Mrs. Piper is Professor James's own particular show, as they say over\nin his country. We have learnt many things from Mrs. Piper, and are glad\nto feel that she is in hands so thoroughly capable of making the most of\nwhat she has to teach, as are those of Professor James and Dr. Hodgson.,\n(borderland. July, 1896, p. 310.)\nThat Miss Freer's recent utterances concerning Mrs. Piper must be\nregarded as unreliable may be illustrated by another instance. She recently\nstated that the few prophecies upon which Mrs. Piper had '' ventured in\nregard to her had none of them ' come off.' ' (Light, December 17th, 189*.\np. 613), but several years previously and when her recollections were\npresumably more trustworthy, she stated that \" four important prophecies ',\nwere made to her, that two of these had been fulfilled, and that the\nremaining two \" were only prevented by my own will, and both were\nprominently brought before me as suggestions.\" (Borderland, January, 1894,\np. 230.)\nRichakd Hodgson.\nMollie Fancher: The Brooklyn Enigma. An Authentic Statement of Facts in\nthe Life of Mary J. Fancher, the Psychological Marvel of the Siineteentii\nCentury. Unimpeachable Testimony of Many Witnesses. By Abram H.\nDailey, Brooklyn, N.Y. pp. XIII., 262.\nThis book consists of a rather disconnected narrative by Judge Dailey,\nabstracts of a diary kept by Miss Fancher's aunt, a series of signed state\nments made by friends, and a number of reprints of articles which had\noriginally appeared in the daily papers. No attempt has been made to\nreduce this mass to a coherent whole. It abounds in repetitions and irrele-\nvancies to such a degree that it is far from easy to extract from it a clear\nhistory of the very interesting case which it is designed to put on record.\nThe main facts may be outlined as follows : \u2014\nMiss Fancher was born August 16th, 1848. As a child her health was\ngood, but in March of 1864 it began to fail. She had \"nervous indigestion,,'\ninability to retain food, \"fainting spells,\" \"weakness in the chest,\" and\nshe \"wasted away.\" May 10th, 1864, she was thrown from her horse and\nseverely injured. In the course of the following summer the lower part of\nher body suddenly became paralysed. She seemed to recover from the\neffects of this accident during the autumn, but on June 8th, 1865, as she\nwas stepping from a street car, the car started too soon, she was throwu\nto the ground, her skirt caught upon a projecting hook, and she was dragged\nsome yards, again receiving serious injuries. This was followed by weakness,\ntransient paralyses, pain, cough, and luemorrhages from the lungs. In\nFebruary, 1866, convulsions appeared. Soon afterwards she lost, in rapid\nsuccession, sight, speech, and hearing. From that date to 1894, when the\nbook was written, her history was that of a hysteric of the worst type\u2014\n\fVart XXXV.] 397\nReview.\nanaesthesias, paralyses, contractures, and convulsions involving now this,\nnow that organ of sense or group of muscles, and succeeding one another in\nbewildering variety. Her sight, however, was never restored, although in\nrecent years she seems to be recovering some portion of it. Throughout\nthis period normal sleep seemed to be replaced by \" trance,\" in which the\nwhole body became rigid.\nIn 1875, after a trance lasting a month, it was found that her memory\nof the nine years immediately preceding had been totally obliterated, the\ncontractures which had marked those years had disappeared, and all the\nskill in embroidery, etc., which she had acquired during them was lost.\nFrom 1875 to the date of the book Miss Fancher's memories were\napproximately continuous, the only exceptions being found in the lives of her\nsecondary selves. She also remembers the events of her early life up to\nthe beginning of the nine-year period. About 1878 a new memory-synthesis\nappeared, but soon vanished, and was not again observed until 1887.\nIt was then named by her friends \" Idol.\" Others of later date were named\n\"Rosebud,\" \"Pearl,\" and \"Ruby.\" The \"normal\" Miss Fancher was\nnamed \" Sunbeam,\" to distinguish her from these. Each of these memory-\nsystems or personalities calls itself Mollie Fancher, possesses a portion of\nMiss Fancher's memories, and remembers its own previous occurrences.\nNo one has any knowledge of any other save in so far as informed by other\npersons. \" R>sebud \" seems to be identical with Mollie Fancher as she was\nat six or seven years. \"Idol\" and \"Pearl\" are young girls of about\nsixteen, but neither recalls the first accident, while \"Ruby,\" who seems\nto be about the same age, recalls the first, but not the second accident.\n\"Idol\" and \"Pearl\" are quiet, and not markedly unlike one another, while\n\"Ruby\" is vivacious, cheerful, and talkative. None of them possesses\n\" Sunbeam's \" acquired skill, and all are extremely unstable, appearing only\nduring the night, and lasting but a few minutes.\nDuring her years of blindness Miss Fancher has convinced her friends\nthat she possessed supernormal powers of vision. It is claimed that she has\nrepeatedly read sealed letters, described events at a distance, and found lost\narticles. She also believes that she sees the world of spirits, but is extremely\nreticent upon that topic.\nOne is disappointed to find that Judge Dailey adduces little evidence of\nvalue in support of these claims. He has, indeed, recorded the narratives\nof many witnesses whose truthfulness no one would question, but in not one\nof these narratives are the facts given with that attention to details and that\ncare to avoid misdescription which the nature of the case demands. Many\nare vague in the extreme, and very few tell us how much time elapsed\nbetween the event and its committal to writing. To glance at only the best\nof these : Prof. Parkhurst submitted to Miss Fancher a sealed envelope con\ntaining a slip of printed paper, the contents of which he did not himself\nknow. She told him it contained the words \"court,\" \"jurisdiction,\" and\nthe numerals 6, 2, 3, 4. These he wrote in his notebook, took the envelope\naway still sealed, read Miss Fancher's statement to two friends, and in\ntheir presence opened the envelope. Miss Fancher's statements were\nfound to be correct. But we are not told how large the type was, how\nmany thicknesses of paper covered it, how Miss Fancher handled the\n\f398 [Supplement.\nWtiu JRomaive Newbold.\nenvelope, how long she had it in her possession, or whether she had it at any\ntime when Prof. Parkhurst was not present.\nDr. Speir states that Miss Fancher once wrote for him upon a slate the\ncontents of a letter which had just been brought to her by the postman, and\nwas as yet unopened. We are not given copies of the two, nor are we told\nhow much time elapsed between the event and the record, nor who wrote\nthe letter, nor whether Miss Fancher could have known that Dr. Speir\nwould be present when the postman came.\nMiss Fancher once told Judge Dailey that she had seen him upon a\ngiven evening with a gentleman whom she described. After some difficulty\nJudge Dailey recollected that upon that evening he had been with a friend\nnamed Sisson. We are not told how he identified the evening. Some\nmonths later Judge Dailey, Mr. Sisson, and another person called upon Miss\nFancher. She at first said she had not before seen either of the two gentle\nmen, but after a moment's reflection said that one, pointing to Mr. Sisson,\nwas the man she had seen with the Judge. This is one of the best cases, as\nit is corroborated by Mr. Sisson, and it appears that his account was written\nonly six months or so after the event. We would like to know, however,\nwhether any further questions were asked Miss Fancher after she had first\nstated that she did not recognise Mr. Sisson.\nIn brief, the evidence which Judge Dailey has collected will seem satis\nfactory only to those who are already satisfied of the possibility of clair\nvoyance. It will do little towards establishing that possibility. And as Miss\nFancher's clairvoyant powers are said to be much less keen now than they\nwere some years ago, it is not probable that her case will contribute much of\nvalue to the evidence for the supernormal. One can readily appreciate the\nrepugnance which Miss Fancher felt to submitting herself to the commission\nof experts suggested by the New York Medico-legal Society, but it is much\nto be regretted that her friends should have allowed the value of her case t,>\nbe lost through mere negligence.\nWm.
