She later worked as a computer programmer.  Psychical Research\n\nHaving read Modern Experiments in Telepathy by SG Soal and F Bateman, Markwick joined the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) in 1969. She became its statistical adviser, sometimes critiquing the methodologies employed by ESP researchers.1\n\nIn the early 1940s, SPR researcher SG Soal reported apparently successful results in ESP card-guessing experiments with Basil Shackleton as the subject. &nbsp;Certain circumstances led later to suspicions of cheating being voiced. In the 1970s, collaborating with DJ West, Markwick used computer technology to expose likely manipulation by SG Soal of data sheets, with the insertion of extra digits to create a false ESP effect. Markwick\u2019s expertise in this regard has been called \u2018exemplary\u2019.2\n\nSee here for full details of the fraud and its exposure.  Selected Works  Articles\n\nCorrespondence (1976).
