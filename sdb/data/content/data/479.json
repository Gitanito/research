W. Baggally, Sir W. Crookes, Miss Alice Johnson, Mr.\n\fJAN., 1903.] Meeting of the Council. 3\n\u2022T. G. Piddington, Mr. F. Podmore, Mrs. Sidgwick, Mr. H. Arthur\nSmith, Dr. C. L. Tuckey, Lieut.-Col. Taylor, Mrs. Verrall, and Mr.\nX. \\V. Thomas, Organising Secretary.\nTwo new members and six new associates were elected. The\nelection of six new associates of the American Branch was\nannounced. The names and addresses are given above.\nIt was announced that one resignation, handed in at the\nprevious meeting, had been withdrawn, and that one associate had\nreplaced his name on the books. The resignations of three\nassociates were announced.\nIt was resolved to hold the Annual Business Meeting in the\nrooms of the Society, at 4.30 p.m., on Jan. 30th, 1903. It was\ndecided to hold Private Meetings in March and April.\nA discussion took place on the best means of disavowing all\nconnection with the Psychic Research Company.\nVarious matters relating to the finances of the Society were\ndiscussed.\nIt was resolved to issue an annual report of Council, giving\ninformation as to the progress of the Society, and the work done\nduring the year.\nPEIVATE MEETING FOR MEMBERS AND ASSOCIATES.\nTHE third of the series of private meetings for members and\nassociates only, was held at 20 Hanover Square, W., on Monday,\nDecember 8th, at 8.30 p.m.\u2014the President, Sir Oliver Lodge, in\nthe chair. A paper, contributed under the pseudonym of Edward\nG-recnu-ood, on \" Some Recent Hypnotic Experiments,\" was read\nby Mr. Podmore. It will be published in the forthcoming\nnumber of the Proceedings, and is therefore not epitomised here\nAt the conclusion of the paper, the President said that he was\nsure that those who had had the advantage of listening to \" Mr.\nGreenwood's \" report would agree with him in regarding it as a\nvaluable contribution to psychology ; and that a special interest\nattached to the experiments, because the subject of them was a\nman of intelligence and refinement.\nHe had been struck by the fact that the operator's suggestions\nappear to have affected not the subject's sensory perceptions so\nmuch as his will ; for instance, when given soap and told that it\nA2\n\f4 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 190S.\ntasted like chocolate, he seemed to be aware that it was soap, but\nto be willing to agree that it tasted like chocolate. In fact, it\nwas a kind of exaggerated complaisance, an extremity of good\nnature, which was produced in this instance ; but it would be too\nrapid induction to conclude that different subjects would be\naffected in the same way.\nDR. LLOYD TUCKEY expressed his appreciation of \" Mr. Green\nwood's\" excellent paper which presented several novel features.\nIn the well-known series of experiments carried out by Professor\nHeidenhain on his brother and others the subjects were pro\nfoundly hypnotised and memory was abolished, or greatly\nimpaired; whereas \"Mr. Greenwood's\" subject seems to have\nretained a normal memory. Being highly educated and in\ntelligent he was able to describe clearly the mental and bodily\nsensations produced by suggestions. The experiments bore out\nBernheiin's theory that hypnotism did but increase susceptibility\nto suggestion. ' Suggestibility ' is a varying quality dependent\nupon individual idiosyncrasy. In some people it is very apparent\nwithout hypnotism, as Bernheim found in his experiments on\npatients in the hospital at Nancy. He was able to impress the\nreality of scenes which he described on many patients so strongly\nthat they were prepared to swear to having seen them before a\nmagistrate. He attributed much false witness in law courts to\nthis excessive suggestibility. On the other hand, Forel and other\nobservers have found that people with a fixed idea often refuse to\npart with it even when deeply hypnotised.\nAs to the power of hypnotic suggestion to make a person\ncommit a crime or moral offence, that again depended upon the\nsubject's receptivity of an idea. The man of high principle and\ntraining would successfully resist evil suggestions, whilst the weak\nor naturally vicious would readily yield to them. Resistance to\nsuggestion can sometimes be overcome by such an insidious\ndevice as that practised by Bernheim, who made a patient steal a\nneighbour's watch, though she at first refused, by assuring her\nthat it was veally her own property and had been stolen from\nher. Dr. Tuckey thought it better to face the possible dangers\nof hypnotism than to deny their existence.\nMR. ADOLPHE SMITH, discussing the question of whether\nsubjects could be induced to commit criminal acts or not, agreed\nwith Dr. Tuckey that this would chiefly depend upon the\n\f., 1903.] Private Meeting for Members and Associates. o\ncharacter of the person experimented on. You could probably\ninduce a criminal to commit crimes, but he did not believe that\nhypnotism could destroy the honesty of an honest man. It\ncould do no more than increase natural tendencies in either\ndirection.\nSIR LAWRENCE JONES observed that if a theory that Mr.\nPodmore had tentatively advanced in his recent book were true,\nvisual and auditory hallucinations must be as common as black\nberries. Yet here they found an exceptionally impressionable\nsubject readily susceptible to hallucinations of the senses of taste\nand smell, yet wholly refractory to suggested hallucinations of the\nsenses of sight and hearing. He went on to describe a collective\nhallucination of the sense of smell, which had been shared by a\nlarge portion of a mixed public audience.\nMR. PODMORE said that he did not think that the practical aspects\nof the paper had received sufficient notice. We had numerous\nrecords of prolonged and successful experiments with persons fully\nentranced ; but he could scarcely recall another instance of a\ncourse of experiments of the kind in question. It seemed not\nimprobable that this semi-hypnoid condition, when the subject,\nthough apparently normal, was yet profoundly amenable to\nhypnotic suggestion, might be quite common ; for it is obvious\nthat, except with alert and intelligent subjects, its existence\nmight readily be overlooked. A state of this kind offered a\nmost fruitful field for investigation, and was not attended with\nany of the inconveniences or drawbacks incident to experiments\nin deep hypnotic trance. He was not, however, quite able to\naccept \" Mr. Greenwood's \" conclusions as to the possibility of\ninducing in this state the performance of crimes. \" Mr. Green\nwood's \" conclusions were based on the subject's analysis of his\nown mental condition ; and it was clear, from other parts of the\npaper, that such an analysis could not be relied upon. The only\nsatisfactory way to test how far a criminal suggestion could\nbe carried would be to let it be carried out not under laboratory\nconditions, but in real life. Unfortunately, the police stood in\nthe way of scientific investigation in this direction.\nTHE PRESIDENT drew attention to the ingenious method em\nployed by \" Mr. Greenwood \" in order to circumvent the moral\nscruples and to gain the acquiescence of his subject, namely,\nthat of inducing, by suggestion, a mood in keeping with and\n\f6 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1903.\nappropriate to the suggested act. After all, this was quite in\naccord with everyday experience. We were led by our mood to\ndo things at a children's party which we should never dream of\ndoing, for instance, at meetings of the Society.\nThe success of a well-known experiment, already referred to\nthat evening by a previous speaker, in which a subject was\ngiven arsenic and ordered to put it in someone's food, after\nhaving been told that it was sugar, he could not regard as\nindicative of the effectiveness of criminal suggestions, because it\nmay be supposed that the subject consented to the suggestion\nonly because he believed that the arsenic was sugar. The\nexperiment showed that a hypnotised subject could readily be\ntricked into committing what Mr. Piddington would call a modal\ncrime, but then so might people not under hypnotic influence.\nAn improved form of the experiment would be to use sugar,\nand to let the subject understand that it was arsenic ; though,\nshould the suggestion be duly carried out, even then it would be\nimproper to draw the conclusion that outside a laboratory\ncriminal suggestions may be accepted by a hypnotised subject,\nbecause it was impossible to decide how far, in the case of\nexperiments, the subject does not retain, somewhere at the back\nof his mind, an inkling that the whole thing is merely a kind of\ngame. The best test would consist in employing real arsenic,\nonly taking care to prevent its being actually swallowed : though\nthis last mental reserve would again partially detract from the\nvalue of the experiment. There seemed little doubt but that\nacts to which the subject was prone, or from which he was not\nin his normal state fundamentally averse, might be precipitated\nby suggestion : and therein lay a danger.\nSir L. Jones had cited an interesting case of collective olfactory\nhallucination, which would be well worth having at first hand ;\nbut it must be borne in mind that the sense of smell is the\nlowest, the least intellectual of the senses, and it did not follow\nthat the higher senses of sight and hearing could be similarly\naffected. The burden of proof would rest with the assertor\nof highly-developed forms of collective hallucination ; and the\nproof will be valuable when forthcoming.\nThe meeting then adjourned.\n\fJAN., 1903.] S.P.R. and Psychic Research Company.\nTHE S.P.R AND THE PSYCHIC RESEARCH COMPANY.\nWE have already in the Journal disowned all connection with\nthe Psychic Research Company ; and we should have thought\nthat the character of this trading Company was sufficiently\nobvious from the advertisements which it issues, and from the\nliterature which it offers for sale.\nThe officials of the Society, however, continue to receive letters\nfrom various members, associates, and others, misled apparently\nby the similarity of the titles, to enquire if there is any con\nnection between the Society and the Company.\nWe therefore emphatically repeat our former disclaimer, and\nwe beg that members and associates, whenever they find it\nsuggested or stated that the Society for Psychical Research is in\nany way connected with the Psychic Research Company, will\nmake a point of dispelling the misapprehension.\nWe also take this opportunity to state that a body calling\nitself \" The Newcastle Society for Psychical Research \" is not a\nlocal branch of, nor in any way allied to the Society for Psychical\nResearch.\nLIST OF PERIODICALS.\nTHE current numbers of the following periodicals are laid upon\nthe table in the Library, and are there available for members\nand Associates.\nAMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHO- PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIEW.\nLOGY.

At the end of the room there was a small table placed against a\nwindow, the table was covered by a tablecloth, and on it rested a paper\nweight, a large slate, a pile of small slates, and another pile of six small\nslates of the same size. This last pile, which for convenience of\nnarration I will call my slates, was on the side of the table close to the\nchair on which I was requested to sit. \" Palma \" handed me a piece of\nstiff white paper 4 inches long by 3 inches wide, and desired me to\nwrite thereon the full name of a person known to me who had departed\nthis life, to address him or her as dear friend, sister, father, etc., as the\ncase might be ; then to write a series of questions, and to sign myself by\nthe familiar or pet name by which I was known to the departed friend.\nThe medium then left the room, and, during his absence, I proceeded to\nwrite the questions according to instructions, folded the paper into two\nparts, and on the medium's return I handed it to him. This paper,\nwhich he folded into four parts, he then placed under the paper-weight\n\fJAN., 1903.] Experience with a Direct Slate-Writing Medium. 9\nwhich lay on the table. A wet sponge and a rag were then given to\nme, and I was asked to see that my slates had no writing on them, and\nto carefully clean and wipe them. While I was doing this the medium\ntook the large slate from the table, retired to the other side of the room\nopposite to where I sat, and proceeded to make a calculation on the\nlarge slate regarding (as he informed me) my horoscope ; for which\npurpose he asked the date of my birth.\nOn my having finished cleaning and wiping my six slates I placed\nthem in a pile on the table. \" Palma \" came to the table, put the large\nslate close to mine, and then cleaned and wiped my slates himself.\nAfter this he transferred the large slate to the top of the other pile of\nsmall slates which were at the further end of the table. The medium\nsubsequently drew his chair close to mine, took the piece of paper\non which I had written the questions from under the paper-weight, and\ndesired me to put it in my pocket. He then held my right hand in one\nof his, \\vent under control of the spirit to whom I had addressed my\nquestions, answered them correctly, and referred to matters mentioned\nin my letter to the deceased friend. The control then left, and\n\"Palma\" let go my hand. After this the medium took up my six\nslates and divided them into two piles of three each. On the top slate\nof one of the piles he placed a small piece of slate pencil, together with\na piece of paper on which were some daubs of different coloured paints,\ncovered the pile on which rested the slate pencil and coloured paper\nwith the other three slates, and then asked me to take the paper with\nthe questions from my pocket and place it under the top slate.\nMy slates were then held, all together, at one end by me, and at the\nother end by \" Palma.'' In a short time the sound of writing was\nheard, during which process the medium was convulsively agitated.\nOn the three top slates being removed, there on the fourth slate\nappeared a message from my departed friend, written in slate pencil,\nand covering the whole of one side of the slate, answering my questions\nand addressing me in the familiar name by which I was known, and\nsigned with his name in full. On the slate, above the message, was\na painting of flowers in various colours.\nThe above is an account of the incidents of my seance with \" Palma \"\nas they apparently occurred.\nWhat really took place was as follows. When the medium returned\nto the room, after I had finished writing my questions, he came provided\nwith a piece of blank, stiff, white paper, folded in four parts, concealed\nin his hand, of the same size as the one he had handed to me.\nOn my giving him my piece he folded it into four parts to\n\f10 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1903.\ncorrespond with the concealed one; he then proceeded to palm mine\nand to substitute for it the blank one (this is a pass well known to\nconjurors, and is easier to perform with thick stiff paper than with\nthin). The blank piece he placed under the paper-weight, and retained\nmine concealed in the palm of his right hand.\n\" Palma \" then lifted the large slate from the table together with a\nsmall slate which lay concealed under it and upon which the coloured\nflowers had already been painted ; he retired to the other side of the\nroom where, under cover of the large slate and under pretence of\ncalculating my horoscope, he opened my paper, read my questions and\nwrote the answers on the concealed small slate, copying, at the same\ntime, my familiar name and the full name of my deceased friend.\nWhile he was thus employed I pretended to be busily engaged in\ncleaning and wiping my six slates, but in reality I was secretly mark\ning each of them with a preparation I had brought with me which\ncould not be rubbed off. When the medium had finished his pretended\ncalculations he placed the large slate, with the concealed prepared\nsmall -slate under it, on the table by the side of my slates. (The\nwriting on the small slate would then be on the under surface).\nUnder pretext of cleaning and wiping my slates, with which he\nfumbled a good deal, he substituted one of them for the concealed\nprepared slate, then made a pile of six slates consisting of five of\nmine and the prepared one, and this last he took care should be at\nthe bottom of the pile with the writing on the under surface. After\nthis he removed the large slate from the surface of the table to the\ntop of the other pile of small slates which were farther away, thus\ntaking away from my vicinity, under cover of the large slate, the one\nof my slates which had been substituted for the prepared one. The\nmedium then drew his chair close to mine, took the blank folded paper\nfrom under the paper-weight, palmed it and substituted my own paper\nwhich he handed to me with the request that I should place it in\nmy pocket.\nThe speech that followed, the medium meanwhile holding my right\nhand, purported, of course, to come from the alleged control, but really\ncorresponded to the patter of a conjuror which is intended to divert\nattention from the sequence of his movements. As the medium had\nalready read my questions, under cover of the large slate, when he\npretended to calculate my horoscope, the alleged control was naturally\nable to answer them correctly and to refer to matters mentioned in my\nletter. When \" Palma \" let go my hand he took up the three top\nslates, placed the slate pencil and piece of paper with the daubs of\n\fJAN., 1903.] Experience with a Direct Slatr-Writiiu\/ Medium. 11\npaint on the upper slate of this pile, then took the remaining three\nslates, in one pile also, and placed them on the first pile, and finally\nreversed the whole of the six slates. (After this movement the\nprepared slate with the writing on the under surface, which had been\nthe bottom slate, would be then the fourth slate from the top and\nwould have the writing on the upper surface). I took the piece of\npaper inscribed with my questions from my pocket and placed it,\nas requested, under the top slate of the newly arranged pile of six\nslates. I then held the slates at one end and the medium held them\nat the other. The sound of writing which was then heard was\nproduced by \"Palma\" scratching the under slate with one of his\nfinger nails. During the process he was convulsively agitated, in order\nthat the movement of the muscles in his hand should not be detected.\nThe three top slates were removed and the writing was disclosed.\nThe writing on the slate does not resemble, in the least, that of my\ndeceased friend, but does resemble the medium's writing. A very\nmarked peculiarity in Palma's writing (a specimen of which is in my\npossession) also appears in the writing on the slate.\nAt the end of the stance I examined the six slates; I found that\nfive of them were still wet and had my secret mark. The one with\nthe writing was perfectly dry and had not my mark, in fact was a\nsubstituted slate which had not formed part of my original six slates.\nZ.\nMR. BROWNING ON D. D.

Its interest is added to by the contrast it offers to\nthe opinion of Mrs. Browning arrived at on the same occasion.\nIn July, 1855, my wife, to whom I was not then married, spent\nan evening with me at the house where Home was then staying,\n\f12 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

As a result I had not the smallest doubt\nthat the \" spirit hands \" which we saw were material and a fraud.\nMy wife formed a similar opinion, but knowing that others thought\ndifferently, and that Mrs. Browning had lately been there, she wrote\nto her, sending as an introduction an old letter from Miss Mitford,\nand received an answer, a copy of which, and of the spontaneous\nexpression of his opinion added by Mr. Browning, I subjoin.\nI give the whole of Mrs. Browning's letter, but the first and last\nparagraphs in it, though possessing an interest of their own, do\nnot bear on the particular question.\nYour obedient servant,\nBrighton, Nov. 16. F. MERRIFIELD.\nCOPY OF LETTER FROM MRS. BROWNING.\n\"Dear Madam,\u2014I hope you will pardon my delay in replying to\nyour letter, and attribute it to the right cause ; my time being\nmuch occupied during our brief visit to London. You address me\nin a name which could not do otherwise than move me to an\nanswer, even if the tone of your application had not made me willing\nto be open with you on your own account.\n\" I went with my husband to witness the so-called spiritual mani\nfestations at Ealing. I enclose to you in his handwriting an account\nof the impressions he received. Mine, I must frankly say, were\nentirely different.\n\" The class of phenomena in question appears to me too numerous\nnot to be recognized as facts. I believe them to occur often under\ncircumstances which exclude the possibility of imposture. That\nthere is sometimes imposture is natural and necessary\u2014for wherever\nthere is a truth there will be a counterfeit of the truth. But if\nyou ask me (as you do) whether I would rank the phenomena\nwitnessed at Ealing among the counterfeits, I sincerely answer\nthat I may be much mistaken, of course, but for my own part, and\nin my own conscience, I find no reason for considering the medium\nin question responsible for anything seen or heard on that occasion.\n\" Having said so much I am anxious to guard myself against mis\nunderstanding. I consider that the idea of looking for theological\nteaching, or any other sort of teaching, to these supposed spirits\nwould be absolutely disastrous.

What we do see is a shadow on the window, a sign of\nsomething moving without\u2014the proof of, and beginning of, access\nfrom a spiritual world\u2014of which we shall presently learn more\nperhaps, and I, for one, believe we shall. You may be unaware\nthat many persons who are called 'believers' in these things believe\nsimply in the physical facts, attribute them to physical causes,\nand dismiss the spiritual theory as neither necessary nor tenable.\n\"This is not my view, however.\n\" I enclose back to you the letter of my dear friend, knowing\nwell the value of such a memorial. And with a most thankful\nsense for the sympathy which you have given to myself personally,\n\"I remain very faithfully yours,\n\"ELIZABETH BARRKTT BROWNING.\n\"London, Wednesday.\"\nFROM MR. BROWNING.\n\"Mr. Browning presents his compliments to Miss de Gaudrion,\nand feels it his duty to say a word for himself in reply to her note\n\u2014though he has to overcome a real repugnance at recurring to\nthe subject of it.\n\" Mr. Browning did, in company with his wife, witness Mr. Hume's\n(sic) performances at Baling on the night Miss de Gaudrion alludes\nto, and he is hardly able to account for the fact that there can be\nanother opinion than his own on the matter\u2014that being that the\nwhole display of 'hands,' 'spirit utterances,' etc., were a cheat\nand imposture. Mr. Browning believes in the sincerity and good\nfaith of the family, and regrets proportionably that benevolent\nand worthy people should be subjected to the consequences of those\nadmirable qualities of benevolence and worth when unaccompanied\nby a grain of worldly wisdom\u2014or, indeed, divine wisdom\u2014either\nof which would dispose of all this melancholy stuff in a minute. Mr.\nBrowning has, however, abundant experience that the best and rarest\nof natures may begin by the proper mistrust of the more ordinary\nresults of reasoning when employed in such investigations as these,\ngo on to an abnegation of the regular tests of truth and rationality\nin favour of these particular experiments, and end in a voluntary\n\f1$ Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Mr. Browning had some\ndifficulty iu keeping from an offensive expression of his feelings at\nthe 'a; he has since seen Mr. Hume and relieved himself. Mr.\nBrowning recommends leaving the business to its natural termina\ntion, and will console himself for any pain to the dupes by supposing\nthat their eventual profit in improved intelligence would be no\notherwise procurable.\n\"13 Dorset Street, Baker Street, Aug. 30, 1855.\"\nA further letter from Mr. Barrett Browning was printed in The,\nTimes Literary Supplement 1'or December 5th, 1902, as follows :\nTo THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.\nSir,\u2014It is with reluctance that I ask your permission to make the\nfollowing remarks on the letters from my father and mother which have\nbeen communicated to you by Mr. Merrifield.\nMr. Hume, who subsequently changed his name to Home, was\ndetected \"in a vulgar fraud,\" for I have heard my father repeatedly\ndescribe how he caught hold of his foot under the table. I also know\nthat when Mr. Hume called at our house he was turned out of it.\nWhat, however, I am more desirous of stating is that towards the end\nof her life my mother's views on \" spiritual manifestations \" were much\nmodified. This change was brought about, in a great measure, by the\ndiscovery that she had been duped by a friend in whom she had blind\nfaith. The pain of the disillusion was great, but her eyes were opened,\nand she saw clearly.\nI am, sir, your obedient servant,\nE. BARRETT BROWNING.\nLa Torre all' Antella, Florence. Dec. 1.\nIn connection with these letters we are allowed to state that Mr.\nMerrifield was the writer of the account printed in the Journal,\nVol. IV., pp. 120-1, which gives a full description (written in\n1889) of one of the Ealing sittings of 1855, and of the apparent\ntrickery observed. Mr. Merrifield writes :\n24 Vernon Terrace, Brighton.\nDecember 9, 1902.\nI think there are none now living to whom the association of my\npersonality with the authorship of the account in the Journal of July,\n\fJAN., 1903.] Mr. Browning on D. D. Home. 15\n1889, could give pain, so I see no reason for withholding my name if it\nis desired. But if it is published I should like this reason given.\nWith regard to the above correspondence, it is satisfactory that\nthe authorship of the hitherto anonymous account of a sitting with\nD. D. Home which appeared in the Journal for July, 1889 (pp.\n120-121), should now be divulged. Although Mr. Merrih'eld\ndid not write his account until 34 years after the sitting in ques\ntion took place, and although for that reason it cannot rank so\nhighly as would a contemporaneously written report, still it merits\ncareful consideration, for it bears the impress of a careful\nobserver, who does not content himself with a mere ex cathedra\nor emotional denunciation, but gives detailed reasons for the want\nof faith that is in him. For a precisely contrary reason the\nletters of Mr. and Mrs. Browning, although of interest as relating\nto the same series of sittings as that to which Mr. Merrifield's\nsitting belonged (a further reference to the same series will be\nfound in Mr. Podmore's Modern Spiritualism, Vol. II., pp. 233-\n236) do not, in our opinion, throw any fresh lighten the problem\nof Home's mediumship. We do not mean by this to suggest that\nMr. or Mrs. Browning were wanting in straightforwardness or\nperspicuity because their private correspondence of 1855 does\nnot furnish such an exposure, or defence, or detailed record of\nHome's phenomena, as our modern standard of evidence in such\nmatters demands ; we merely wish to urge that their letters make\nno substantial contribution to the existing data.\nMr. Browning refers to no specific act of trickery : nor does\nMrs. Browning seem to have been called upon to meet on Home's\nbehalf any specific charge of fraud.\nMr. Browning's letter, no less than Mr. Sludge the Medium (in\nspite of the prodigious introspective power therein displayed),\nstrikes us as tinged with the animus of the man of sensitive\ntemperament, whose disgust with the vulgarity of spiritualistic\nphenomena precludes him from forming a calm estimate of their\nauthenticity ; and it may be permissible to surmise that, in Mr.\nBrowning's case, this animus may have been intensified by an\nanxiety to save others, whose mental welfare was very precious to\nhim, from the ill-effects of precipitate credulity.\nAs for Mr. Barrett Browning's statement that he has heard his\n' father repeatedly describe how he caught hold of his [i.e. Home's]\nfeet under the table,' it is worth nothing as evidence so long as\n\f16 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1903.\nthe circumstances of the seizure are not described. Mr. Eobert\nBrowning might have caught hold of D. D. Home's foot many a\ntime, or pulled his leg, or even his nose, without fixing any, at\nleast moral, stigma on the medium, and without being justified in\ndeducing ' ex pcde Hcrcvlcm.' Furthermore, it is strange that\nwhen Mr. Browning explained to Mr. Myers (v. Journal, Vol. IV.,\np. 102) \" the circumstances which mainly led to that opinion of\nHome which was expressed in Mr. Sludge the Medium\" no\nmention was apparently made of any seizure of the medium's\nfoot. Mr. Browning was ' powerfully impressed' by some un\nrecorded second-hand evidence about Home having been found\nexperimenting with phosphorus on the production of \" spirit-\nlights.\" Had any reference been made by Mr. Browning to his\nhaving seized Home's foot under compromising circumstances Mr.\nMyers could hardly have failed to have reported it, and to have\naccorded due weight to Mr. Browning's first-hand evidence. If\nMr. Barrett Browning had recorded for the first time 47 years\nafter the event some recollection of his father's favourable to\nHome's claims, we should have soon heard talk of ' mythopaeic\nmemory,' and we should in any case have been bound to reject\nthe evidence as worthless. And the same standard must apply to\nthe letters published in the Times. We hold no brief for D. D.\nHome, but we think it right to guard against undue weight\nbeing attached to them.\nKEMINISCENCE OF A LONG-FOKGOTTEN LANGUAGE\nDR. MEKCIER, in his remarks on this subject, quoted in the\nOctober Journal, trots out the familiar case of the Hebrew-\ntalking maid-servant. It may be well to recall on what\nevidence the case rests. Coleridge says in his Biographia\nLitcra?-ia, I. 117, \"It occurred in a Roman Catholic town in\nGermany a year or two before my arrival in Gottingen \" [in\nJanuary, 1799]. He goes on to say that an uneducated\nyoung woman was heard by the monks and priests of the\nneighbourhood to talk Latin, Greek and Hebrew with a very\ndistinct enunciation. A young physician took up the case,\nand on the strength of his report many eminent psychologists\n\fJA>-., 1903.] Reminiscence of a Long-Forgotten Language. 17\nand physiologists visited the town. Sheets full of her ravings\nwere taken down and found to be intelligible, if disconnected,\nutterances in the languages named above. Further inquiry\nshowed that the girl had seventeen years previously entered\nthe service of a Protestant pastor, who was in the habit of\ndeclaiming aloud from his favourite books within earshot of\nthe kitchen. Among his books were found Latin, Greek\nand Hebrew authors, in which many of the passages taken\ndown at the bedside of the young woman were traced and\nidentified.\nIt does not appear that Coleridge ever met the young\nphysician or any of the distinguished men of science who\ninvestigated the case. He seems to have based his narrative\non the gossip of Gottingen some years after the event. It\nis a highly suspicious circumstance that no report either of\nthe young physician or of the eminent personages who visited\nthe town has come down to us. Both the young physician,\nthe eminent personages, the town, the pastor, and the girl\nherself are anonymous.\nThe story told by Coleridge may or may not be true.\nFor us it is at lest third-hand, and may be fourth or fifth-\nhand. If the academic psychologist thinks that he is entitled\nto quote his leading cases on no better evidence he has much\nto learn from Psychical Eesearch.\nIt may not be uninstructive in this connection to glance at a\ncase reported in the papers this summer on the authority of a\ncorrespondent of the Paris-Nouvelles. I take the facts from the\nRevue des Etudes Psychiques. A sister at the orphanage of Grezes\nwas reported, in the newspapers of June 14th, to have spoken to\nperfection Greek, Eussian, German, English, etc. She is even\nstated to have spoken Carib with a bishop in partibus.\nThe Revue des Etudes Psychiques (July, 1902) quotes,\nhowever, the following testimonies from the Paris papers.\nThe Mother Superior said to a correspondent of the Journal :\n\" It is untrue that she speaks languages unknown to her.\" Dr.\nSeguret, her medical attendant, told a correspondent of the\nFranfais that the sister had replied to a question in Carib\nby a single word, which meant 'good day.' This he had at\nfirst-hand, not having been present himself. As an explanation\nhe suggested the very probable theory that the bishop in question\n\f18 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1903.\nwas expecting this answer, and that there was at most a case\nof thought transference.\nThe writer of the original article professed to have collected\nhis information on the spot and on the best authority. If\nhis statements under these circumstances are so wide of the\ntruth it is not difficult to form an estimate of the value of\nColeridge's contribution to science.\nX. W.

The author shows how the belief in\nAmerica, the land of its birth, was incubated in the trance revelations of\nAndrew Jackson Davis : how it spread with epidemic rapidity through the\nAmerican continent, and reached Europe in 1853. Its history in this country\nin given at length, and the book concludes with a detailed criticism of the\nchief items of evidence relied on by modem Spiritualists and the marvellous\nfeats of Eusapia Paladino, the slate writing of Eglinton, the experiments\nmade by Zolluer with Slade, and by Sir W. Crookes and others with D.

[MAR., 1903.\nREPORT OF THE COUNCIL TO THE MEMBERS AND\nASSOCIATES OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL\nRESEARCH FOR THE YEAR 1902.\nWITH a view to laying before the Society a somewhat fuller\naccount than was contained in the statement made to the\nAnnual Meeting, the Council report as follows of the work\ndone during the year 1902:\nSome important changes were effected during the year. At\nthe end of March Mr. E. T. Bennett retired from the post of\nAssistant Secretary, which he had held for twenty years. The\nCouncil desire to express their appreciation of his long and\nfaithful services. Mr. N. W. Thomas was appointed as Organis\ning Secretary, and at the end of March the rooms of the\nSociety were removed from Buckingham Street to more con\nvenient quarters at 20 Hanover Square, London, W.\nWith regard to the balance-sheet for the year, appended\nbelow, a few points may be noted. The most Satisfactory\nfeature in it is the amount of the annual subscriptions, which\nshow an increase of \u00a3153 over those of 1901. In the latter\nyear (in which the amount was larger than ever before), there\nhad been an increase of \u00a373 over the year before, so that the\nmain source of income of the Society has been rising during\nthese years, whereas during the four previous years it had\nbeen falling.\nFurther special subscriptions and donations were received\nin response to the appeal issued by the Council in 1901, and\nthere was besides a special donation of \u00a3750, which formed\nthe nucleus of the Endowment Fund announced below.\nThe sales of publications brought in \u00a354 more than in\n1901, and \u00a325 10s. was realised on the sale of crystals.\nOn the other hand, the expenses of the year have been in\nsome respects unusually heavy. The expenses connected with\nthe removal to the new rooms (including furniture) amounted\nto \u00a3196. Two items of ordinary expenditure have also been\nincreased, namely, rent and salaries (the latter item is especially\nlarge this year, because nearly \u00a3100 of the salaries of 1901\n\fMAR., 1903.] Report of Council to Members and Associates. 39\nis included). That, in spite of these extra expenses, the\nbalance at the end of the year is even larger than usual is\nmainly owing to the accidental circumstance that the bills\nfalling due to be paid during 1902 for the printing of\nProceedings amounted to considerably less than usual.\nThe number of elections during the year was unusually\nlarge; 21 new Members were elected and 6 Associates became\nMembers; 87 new Associates were elected, besides 12 who,\nhaving ceased to belong, have now resumed their connection\nwith the Society. Against this has to be set the loss of 5\nMembers and 51 Associates from various causes; besides a\nlarge number of names struck off the list of persons who had\nbeen lost sight of, or who had for some time ceased to sub\nscribe. The actual number of Members at the present date\n(February, 1903) is 235, and of Associates 5871; including\n36 Honorary Members and 26 Honorary Associates. The\nnumber of Members and Associates of the American Branch\nis 524.\nSince the removal to Hanover Square the Library has been\nreorganised and made more accessible. A complete slip cata\nlogue has been prepared, and nearly 1000 pamphlets and\nmagazine articles arranged and catalogued. A number of\nperiodical publications have been bound, and the current\nnumbers of the periodicals taken (a list of which was given\nin the Journal for January) are placed on the table, and are\nthere available for Members and Associates, who, it is hoped,\nwill profit by the increased facilities and make more use of\nthe Library. It is open every day from 11 to 5.\nThe MSS. of printed and published cases have been more\ncompletely sorted and arranged, and the whole of the un-\nprinted material will shortly be classified and indexed. Most\nof this, however, is of little value, as the valuable cases, unless\ntoo private, are generally printed in the Journal or Proceedings.\nA register is kept of cases sent in, and the MSS. of these,\nas well as of cases already printed, will continue to be stored\nat the Rooms.\nA considerable number of cases were, as usual, investigated\nduring the year, partly by the officials of the Society, partly\n1 The apparent falling off in the numbers is due to greater strictness having\nbeen exercised in sinking off the names of defaulting members from the register.\n\f40 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAK., 1903.\nby Members and Associates, some of whom spent much time\nand trouble in giving assistance in this work. A few of\nthese cases have already appeared in the Journal. The\nOrganising Secretary also visited three \" haunted houses \" in\nthe course of the year. In two cases nothing calling for\ninvestigation was observed ; in the third raps were heard,\nfor which no physical cause was discovered, but there was\nno evidence of intelligent agency. Mr. Thomas also made a\npersonal investigation into a case of the alleged passage of\nmatter through matter at Berlin. His report of this appeared\nin the Journal for April, 1902.\nIn accordance with a decision reached in 1901, the number\nof General Meetings of the Society has been reduced to three\nper annum, and a series of private meetings, open to Mem\nbers and Associates only, has been initiated. The attendance\nof Members and Associates has been considerably larger than\nin previous years ; the attendance of visitors at the General\nMeetings has also been large, but since the accommodation\nis limited, it has been necessary, in the interests of Members\nand Associates, to restrict the number of invitations to\nvisitors.\nThree general and three private Meetings were held during\nthe year. The following papers were presented :\n* Jan. 29th, PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS by SIR OLIVER LODGE, F.E.S.\n* May 30th, MALAY SPIRITUALISM; by MR, W. W. SKEAT.\nJune 20th, AUTOMATIC ROMANCE; by Miss M. BRAMSTON.\nOct. 17th, SOME RECENT EXPERIMENTS IN AUTOMATIC WRITING;\nby MRS. A. W. VERRALL.\n*Nov. 14th, HUMAN SENTIMENT WITH REGARD TO A FUTURE\nLIFE ; by MR. F. C. S. SCHILLER.\nDec. 8th, SOME EXPERIMENTS IN HYPNOTISM ; by MR. EDWARD\nGREENWOOD (pseudonym).\n\"These were General Meetings.\nExperiments in thought-transference were carried on at\nintervals throughout the year at the Rooms. The results,\nwhile not entirely disappointing, were not decisive enough to\njustify publication, at least at present. The Council wish to\nthank the ladies who kindly acted as percipients in these\n\fMAR., 1903.] Report of Council to Members and Associates. 41\nexperiments. They would be glad to hear of others who\nwould be willing to take part as percipients\u2014especially those\nwho have some capacity for automatic writing or crystal\ngazing. A certain number of sittings for physical phenomena\nhave been held at the Rooms by members of the Council and\nothers, at which a specially constructed stance table, kindly\npresented by Colonel G. Le M. Taylor, was used.\nThe Rooms are available for experiments after 5 p.m.\nApplication for the use of them should be made to the\nOrganising Secretary.\nThe Council wish to urge the desirability of a greater\namount of co-operation between members generally, and appeal\nfor their more active aid. Those who have no opportunity\nfor experimental work may be able by systematic enquiry,\neven among a restricted circle of acquaintances, to discover\nspontaneous phenomena of interest. A useful field of work\nis in the careful collection of well-evidenced cases of veridical\nhallucinations or other impressions (especially those coinciding\nwith a death unknown to the percipient), and facts of much\nvalue may be brought to light by systematic effort.\nFor suggestions as to the kinds of work that may be done\nand methods of doing it, members may be referred to the\ncircular printed in the Journal for June, 1901, pp. 86-92.\nFurther copies of this circular may be obtained on application.\nThe Council would also recommend the formation of small\nlocal groups for experiment and discussion. To facilitate this,\na list of members residing in a given area can be obtained\nfrom the Organising Secretary.\nFinally the Council would urge on members the importance\nof making the work of the Society more generally known\nand of securing the adhesion of new members.

[MAR., 1903.\nENDOWMENT FUND FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nTHE scheme for endowing a Research Scholarship in Psychical\nScience announced by Sir Oliver Lodge in his Presidential\nAddress on January 30th is now complete, the Trust Deed\nhaving been signed and sealed. The Trustees under the Deed\nare Mr. J. G. Piddington, Sir Oliver Lodge, Mr. S. C. Scott,\nMr. F. Podmore and Mr. H. A. Smith. The fund of the trust\nnow amounts to \u00a32000, and it is anticipated that it will\nbe increased by subscriptions and contributions by legacy or\notherwise. Both the original sum and further contributions to\nit are to be invested by the Trustees at their discretion in\nany stocks, funds or securities authorised by law for the invest\nment of trust funds.\nThe income arising from the investments will for twenty-one\nyears be accumulated and added to the capital, and from time\nto time, as it amounts to the sum of \u00a3100, will be invested.\nIf after twenty-one years the trust funds do not amount to\n\u00a38000, the income will be treated as part of the ordinary\nrevenue of the Society.\nAs soon as the trust funds amount to \u00a38000, the Council\nis empowered to found a Research Scholarship, which will be\nopen to persons of either sex and of any nationality. Elections\nto the Scholarship will be made by the Council. Every\nelection will be for one year only, but any holder of the\nScholarship will be eligible for re-election, and it will not\nbe obligatory on the Council to fill the Scholarship.\nSo much of the income of the Trust Fund as the Council\nmay from time to time direct will be paid to the then\nScholar. Any part of the income that is not required for\nthe purposes of the Scholarship may be applied in making\nspecial grants for investigations made or other work done\non the Society's behalf, or be otherwise dealt with as part\nof the ordinary revenue of the Society.\nThe chief aim of the promoters of the Fund was that\ncareful and prolonged experiments might be conducted by some\ncompetent person who could give all his time to the work\nwithout being interrupted by other business, and other work not\nstrictly experimental might sometimes be undertaken. Accord\n\fMWR-, 19O3.1 Endowment Fund for Psychical Research. 45\ningly every person elected to the Scholarship will be obliged\nduring the tenure thereof to devote the whole or such part of\nhis time as the Council may require to the purposes of the\nSociety and to investigations on its behalf. He will be ex\npected to act generally under the direction of the Council and\nto report to them from time to time. The copyright of all\nreports or other writings made by him in relation to the\nSociety's work will be the absolute property of the Society.\nAny travelling expenses incurred under the direction of the\nCouncil and in the Society's behalf may be paid by the\nSociety.\nThe Society may at any time apply any part of the capital\nof the Trust Funds that the Council may think fit towards\nthe establishment and fitting up of a Psychical Laboratory.\nThe power of appointing new Trustees will be vested in the\nCouncil, which will also have the power generally to determine\nany questions or matters of doubt arising in the execution of\nthe Trust. Seven clear days' notice must be given to each\nmember of the Council of any resolution either to vary or\nrevoke the conditions of the Trust or to authorise any dealing\nwith the capital of the Trust funds, and any such resolution,\nto be valid, will require to be passed by a majority of two-\nthirds of the Council then present and voting, and confirmed\nby a like majority at the next meeting. The other powers\nconferred on the Council by the Trust Deed may be exercised\nby a resolution carried by a simple majority.\nOBITUAKY.\nMR. A. N. AKSAKOFF.\n(June 8th, 1832\u2014January 17th, 1903.)\n\"VERY few are those of whom one can say that throughout\ntheir life they remained faithful to one idea, pursued one\naim and devoted to its realisation the whole of their energy.\nMr. Aksakoff was one of the number. From the moment\nwhen he finished his education at the Imperial Lyceum up\nto the day when, in declining age, three or four years ago,\nhis physical strength\u2014though not, at first at least, his mental\n\f46 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAS., 1903.\nI\nvigour\u2014was broken, he did not relinquish the task with\nwhich he ' had identified his life and which ultimately culminated\nin an attempt at a scientific demonstration of human survival.\nAn accidental acquaintance with Swedenborg's work on\nHeaven and Hell was instrumental in showing Mr. Aksakoff\"\nthe way from which he never again departed. Swedenborg's\ndoctrine made on him a lasting impression. He next began\nto study A. J. Uavis's works and found in them what\nseemed to him a striking confirmation of some of Swedenborg's\nteachings. To the study\u2014and translation into German and\nEussian\u2014of both these writers Mr. Aksakoff devoted several\nyears. He next turned his attention to Animal Magnetism ;\nbut it was not till 1871 that he became personally acquainted\nwith \" mediumistic \" phenomena through the late D. D. Home.\nProfessor A. Boutleroff, the well-known chemist and a relation\nof Mr. Aksakoff's by marriage, took part in the stances, and\nwas soon joined by another savant, Professor N. Wagner,\nall three becoming convinced of the genuineness of the\n\" manifestations.\" As a consequence of these sittings with\nD. D. Home and afterwards with Bredif, a French medium,\nProfessor Wagner published in the Vestnik Europy (European\nMessenger) a letter proclaiming his belief in the phenomena,\nwhich created quite a sensation.\nIn 1874 Mr. Aksakoff founded at Leipsic the monthly\nreview Psychische Studien, of which he remained Editor till\n1899. In 1875, the well-known chemist, Professor Mende-\nleeff, suggested that a scientific commission should be officially\nappointed to investigate \" the Physical Phenomena of Spiri\ntualism.\" Mr. Aksakoff went expressly to England to\nfetch mediums for the Commission\u2014Eussian ones being\napparently inaccessible. He brought to St. Petersburg at\nhis own expense the Petty brothers, of Newcastle, and Mrs.\nMarshall, who appeared before the Commission as \" Mrs.\nClayer.\" The Petty mediums failed completely, whilst \" Mrs.\nClayer's \" phenomena left the Commission incredulous, and\nthe experiments soon came to an end, Mr. Aksakoff being\nof opinion that the impartiality of the investigators was\nnot on a par with their learning.\nIn 1878 Mr. Aksakoff conducted a prolonged series of\nexperiments with the notorious \" Dr.\" Slade, who had come\n\fMAB., 1903.] Obituary. 47\nto St. Petersburg fresh from the Zollner stances ; but the\nresults were chiefly negative.\nIn 1881 Mr. Pribitkoff, a retired officer of the Russian\nNavy and now an Honorary Associate of the Society for\nPsychical Research, founded a weekly paper called the Eebus,\nwhich, little by little and labouring under many difficulties,\nbecame the recognised organ of Russian \" Spiritists \" and\neven\u2014to some extent\u2014Psychical Researchers. Great was the\naid which Mr. Aksakoff afforded from the beginning to the\nnew journal, both from the literary and the financial point\nof view.\nIn 1883 Mr. Aksakoff conducted\u2014always in St. Peters\nburg\u2014a series of experiments with Mrs. Jencken, nte Fox,\nwhich were satisfactory to him personally, and in 1886\nwith Eglinton. In 1892 he took the initiative of the Milan\nstances with Eusapia.\nIn 1885 the German philosopher Eduard von Hartmaun\npublished his work on Spiritism, to which Mr. Aksakoff\nundertook to reply, his great work Animism and Spiritism\nbeing the result. Surely this book is too well known to need\na word of comment or commendation on my part ! Suffice it\nto say that it has become a classic for all students of the\nsubject.\nIt is more than difficult to give in this brief sketch an\nadequate idea of all that Mr. Aksakoff did\u2014both in Russia\nand in Germany\u2014in connection with Psychical Research,\nand his name will always be remembered as that of one\nof the greatest pioneers of this new science. As one who\nknew the deceased for upwards of twelve years I may avail\nmyself of this opportunity to mention that he sympathised\nwith the work of the English Society for Psychical Research\nthoroughly, and had the highest possible opinion of the\nmerits of such workers as the late F. W. H. Myers, Sir\nOliver Lodge, the late Professor and Mrs. Sidgwick and others.\nEven the campaign\u2014if I may be permitted to use this\nterm\u2014led in 1886 and 1887 against Eglinton's slate-writing\ndid not repel him as it did, for instance, W. Stainton Moses.\nIn his review of Animism and Spintism, published in\n1890 (Proceedings S.P.R, Vol. VI., p. 670) the late Mr.\nMyers said he thought the list of cases, as quoted by Mr:\n\f48 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAB., 1903.\nAksakoff, \" might well undergo revision.\" In answer to this\ncontention Mr. Aksakoff always maintained that he could\nnot vouch for every incident in particular; he was only\nresponsible, he said, for the class or type. Opinions may\nnaturally differ on this point ; but whatever may be thought\nof some of Mr. Aksakoff's critical methods, all will agree\nas to his learning, his lack of fanaticism\u2014so favourably con\ntrasting him with many other Spiritist writers\u2014and his\nextraordinary perseverance. In collecting evidence for cases\nof a supernormal character he spared no pains. In 1894\nhe went to Helsingfors on purpose to investigate a case of alleged\npartial \" dematerialisation \" of the medium's body at a se'ance\nof Mrs. d'Esperance's\u2014a whole book being the result. Here\nI will take the liberty to state that in my opinion the\ncase was not worth all the trouble Mr. Aksakoff took in\nconnection with it. (It should be borne in mind that he\nwas on particularly friendly terms with Mrs. d'Esperance and\nentertained the highest regard for her \" mediumship.\") Mr.\nAksakoff was instrumental in saving from oblivion many\nremarkable cases. Two such cases (Poltergeists) printed in\nhis remarkable work The Precursors of Spiritism (St. Peters\nburg, 1895) were reviewed by Dr. Leaf in Proceedings S.P.R.,\nVol. XII., p. 319.\nAs an experimenter it is noteworthy that Mr. Aksakoff\nsucceeded in exposing several among the best known pro\nfessional mediums. And judging by what he used to relate,\nI do not think that most of his own experiments reached a\nparticularly high level of success. His seances with Slade\nin 1878 were a source of great disappointment to him,\nand the same may be said of some sittings he had with\nMrs. A. E. Fay some eleven years later. He told me him\nself that his belief in \" slate-writing \" was based not so much\non what he had seen as on what he had read. In 1886\nhe conducted with Eglinton, in London, a series of photo\ngraphic experiments for the express purpose of disproving von\nHartmann's theory. Some years later in conversation with\nme he stated that some of the results he then obtained\nnow seemed to him suspicious, though still believing in the\ngenuineness of others ; and in answer to a question from\nme as to the part played by the \" spirits \" in this admixture\n\fMAK., 1903.] Obituary. 49\nof possible fraud and (supposed) truth\u2014he rather vehemently\nexpressed as to the moral standard of the \" spirits \" ideas\nwhich I was astonished to hear from him. Still he believed\nin the mediumship of both Eglinton and Slade ; and his\nexperiments with Williams, Home, Bre\"dif, Mrs. Jencken and\nEusapia\u2014to mention no other mediums 1\u2014gave him satis\nfaction.\nPersonally he was one of the kindliest and most sympa\nthetic of men. His generosity was great and his modesty\nand discretion still greater ; in this he had much of the\ntrue grand seigneur. His services to the cause will as little\nbe forgotten as his memory is likely to pass away from\nthe recollection of those who were privileged to know him.\nSit ei terra levis. M. PETROVO-SoLOVOVO.\nFAITH-HEALING.\nIN the following case, though the malady was not cured by\nthe faith of the patient, there seems evidence that his life was\nprolonged by it. The case was sent to us by the Rev. Aug.\nGlardon, who wrote :\nTOUR DK PEILZ, VAUD, October 12th, 1900.\nThis morning I went and paid a visit to a carpenter, Henry\nCornaz by name, whom I had heard to be dangerously ill with\ncancer. I found him very ill indeed with a cancerous tumour in\nthe mouth, cheek, and nose. Our best surgeons in Lausanne told\nhim that it was too late for attempting an operation, and that\nno remedy would avail anything.\nI found him quite cheerful. He is a very good man, a kind\nof mystic ; and he told me that he was sure of recovering.\n\" One night last week,\" he said, \" while sleeping I heard a voice\nsaying : ' Be of good cheer, thou shalt recover, and still be my\nwitness in this and in other lands.' I awoke, full of joy ; and\nhaving gone again to sleep, I heard the voice a second time repeat\ning the same words. Hence my confidence.\"\nSupposing he were to recover his health, I would send you certi-\n1 Some readers may be astonished not to find the late Sambor's name\nmentioned in this connection. It should be mentioned that this medium did\nnot appear on the scene till Mr. Aksakoff's health was too much broken to-\nconduct anything like a series of regular experiments.\n\f50 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAB., 1903.\nficates of our medical men testifying both to his incurable disease\nand to his having been restored to health. . . .\nBut I must add that, for me, I have not the slightest human\nhope for him. He is about fifty years old, and the disease has\nbrought him down fearfully. AUG. GLARDON.\nOn January 13th, 1901, Mr. Glardon wrote again:\nI believe [the dream occurred] about a week before my letter of\nOctober 12th, after that the three medical men seen by Cornaz had\nagreed in declaring that the disease could not be cured, and that\nit was too late for an operation.\nI have since been talking with one of them, Dr. E. Ceresole (son\nof the late President of the Swiss Confederation). He confirmed\ntheir verdict, and agreed to give me, when and if needed, a written\nstatement about Cornaz's case and a certificate of cure. He still\nthinks that a cure is not possible, however, in which case his note\nwould not be needed.\nNow, I want you to know that since the middle of November\n\u2022Cornaz has been gradually improving, although still far from being\nrecovered. After a few weeks in bed, with haemorrhages in the\nnose and mouth, he got stronger, was enabled to rise, and finally\nto go out He does now sometimes take long walks, has less\n\u2022difficulty in speaking, his face is less swollen, and the cancerous\nexcrescences in his mouth and nose have diminished in size.\nHis faith in the vision has sometimes wavered ; just now he is\nvery hopeful, although the doctors refuse to give him remedies,\nwhich they deem useless. Dr. Ceresole thinks that his faith or auto\nsuggestion may be the cause\u2014is probably the cause\u2014of the improve\nment, only he adds that the improvement will be temporary.\n... I shall write again on the subject, sooner or later according\nto circumstances. If Cornaz were to die in his prime he would\nbe missed greatly in our religious circles and societies, in which he\nis much liked. AUG. GLARDON.\nIn answer to our request for a medical history of the case\nup to that date, Mr. Glardon kindly obtained for us the follow\ning statement contained in a letter from Dr. Ceresole :\nVEVEY, 26 Janvier, 1901.\nJe vous prie de bien vouloir m'excuser de n'avoir pas\nre'pondu plus t6t a votre lettre. Je vous fais tres volontiers\nla declaration que Monsieur H. Cornaz est atteint d'une affection\n\u2022tout a fait incurable ; je souhaite de tout mon coeur pour ce brave\n\fMAK., 1903.] Faith-Healing. 51\nhomme que cette affirmation soit de'mentie par 1'avenir et que la\nfaillibilite de la science m4dicale soit une fois de plus d^montre'e.\nJe ne me sens par contre pas en situation de declarer que 1'^tat\nde M. Cornaz, que j'ai vu il y a une dizaine de jours, se soit\name'liore depuis 1'automne. Au contraire la tumeur dont est atteint\nM. C. a envahi les narines, inlilt IT davantage la face et se deVeloppe\naussi dans la cavitr buccole.\nL'olat gem;ral reste assez bon et le sera, tant que 1'alimentation sera\nencore possible. L'am^lioration que M. Cornaz croit avoir constated me\npai aft. done \u00a3tre la consequence d'une auto-suggestion, bien frequente\nchez les malades. Je voudrais qu'il en fut autrement, mais je crains\nbien que 1'avenir ne me donne raison. DR. E. CERESOLE.\nMr. Glardon adds (January 28th, 1901):\nI forward Dr. Ceresole's note. As you will perceive, he has not\nthe slightest hope of an ultimate recovery. And the improvement\nin Cornaz's condition is more apparent than real ; not even that.\nDr. Ceresole affirms that the tumour has expanded.\nWell, Cornaz himself says that he feels much better.\nI went to see him this morning, and only found his wife ; and,\nin answer to my inquiries, she said :\n\" My husband is certainly better. The ' thing ' in the mouth has\ndiminished; he can eat with less difficulty, and feels much stronger.\nHe has just gone out for a walk, notwithstanding the wind and rain.\"\n\"Then,\" said I, \"he still believes in a recovery?\"\n\" Most certainly, although ready to submit to the will of God.\nBut, as you know, he had twice the same vision in one night, and\nbelieves that the prediction will be realised.\"\nSuch is just now the state of things. Cornaz, whom I have met\na few days ago, looks a good deal better, and I have myself ascer\ntained, de visit, that if the nostrils have been invaded, the tumour\nin the mouth is two-thirds smaller. Formerly Cornaz had to keep\nhis mouth open, now he can and does keep it shut. He could hardly\nspeak, now he does speak and make himself understood easily. . . .\nOn March 14th, 1901, Mr. Glardon wrote: \"Henry Cornaz\nkeeps improving wonderfully. He says so, and he looks so.\"\nWe received no more news of the case until September of\nlast year, when Mr. Glardon wrote :\nSeptember 9th, 1902.\nMy friend, the carpenter Henri Cornaz, died and was buried a\nweek ago, after a protracted illness and long sufferings.\n\f52 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAR., 1903.\nYou remember what I told you of his conviction, based on a\ndream, that his illness would not prove fatal. During about six\nmonths he remained steady in his faith ; the disease had gone back\nwonderfully, he seemed in a fair way of recovery, and already the\nmedical men were wondering and almost shaken in their mind about\ntheir own dark prognostics.\nHowever, during last winter a change for the worse took place.\nCornaz began to waver in his belief; and during the last four\nmonths of his life he gradually prepared himself to die. . . .\nAUG. GLARDON.\nWe asked Mr. Glardon if he could obtain any further state\nments about the case from medical men who were acquainted\nwith it, but he replied :\nI am sorry to say that I cannot give you the medical history of this\nCornaz case. Dr. Ceresole has settled in Alexandria (Egypt), and\nsince his departure, a few days after I sent you his account of the\ncase, our poor friend has applied to one quack after the other, in\ncompliance, I believe, with the wishes of his family. . . .\nAs for the improvement itself, no one around Cornaz could doubt\nit, because it was very apparent, and that appearance lasted many\nmonths. No one could certify about it better than his wife, but I\nwould not dream of asking her a written statement for the benefit\nof the S.P.R. You have no idea how much our people are averse\nto having anything to do with such things, both in the lower and\nin the higher classes. AUG. GLARDON.\nFrom an account in the Feuille de Temperance (Lausanne)\nof November llth, 1902, sent to us later by Mr. Glardon, it\nappears that Henri Cornaz had been a victim of the drink\nhabit from the age of about 19 to 37, and had consequently\nbrought his wife and family into great poverty. He signed\nthe pledge in 1882, in consequence of the representations of\na doctor as to the sufferings he was bringing on his children.\nFrom that time he never relapsed, but became an ardent\nadvocate of temperance and a leading member of the Society\nof the Groix-Bleue. He also more than recovered the position\nwhich he had lost in his business.\nThe newspaper gives a brief account of his illness, stating\nthat it made much slower progress and for a long time was\nmuch less painful than the physicians had expected. No\nreference is made to the dream predicting his recovery.\n\fNOTICES.\nCOUNCIL MEETING,\nThe next Meeting of the Council will be held at 20 Hanover Square,\nLondon, W., ou Friday, March 13th, 1903, at 3 p.m.\nPRIVATE MEETING FOR MEMBKKS AND ASSOCIATES.\nA Private Meeting for Members and A^nriat,^ ,,nl,\/ will be held in\nthe Hall at 20 Hanover Square, London, W.. on Friday, March 13th. l!io;{,\nat 4.30 p.m., when a paper will be read on \"A CASE UK SECONDARY PER\nSONALITY,\" communicated by PROFESSOR J.

The author shows how the belief in\nAmerica, the land of its birth, was incubated in the trance revelations of\nAndrew Jackson Davis: how it spread with epidemic rapidity through the\nAmerican continent, and reached Europe in 18f>3.

JUNE, 1903.\nTHE DIVINING EOD.\nSINCE the publication of Professor Barrett's last Report on the\nDivining Eod in Proceedings, Vol. xv., p. 130 et seq., a mass\nof additional evidence has been received by him, some of\nwhich will, we hope, be laid before the Society in future.\nHe sends us meanwhile the following account, which is of\nmore than usual interest, as coming from an educated man\nwho accidentally discovered that he had the power of dowsing,\nand has been very successful in the practice of it.\nThe account comes from Major Wedderburn Maxwell, of\nGlenlair, N.B., the first part being contained in a letter ad\ndressed to his brother, Mr. H. Wedderburn, of Balliol College,\nOxford, which was obtained for us by the kindness of Mr.\nAndrew Lang.\nGlenlair, Dalbeattie, N.B., 2lst January, 1903.\nI knew nothing about water-finding until Mr. Houston came\nhere\u2014at my request\u2014on Wednesday, 9th July, 1902\u2014to show me\nhow he found water, and to try and find a fresh supply for Charteris,\nthe joiner, who had set the sanitary inspector at me, as his land\nlord, as the water supply at Bankend had run short on account of\nthe great drouth last spring. Mr. Houston came over from Bar-\nwhillanty, and brought six twigs of different trees cut out of a\nhedge, and a twisted wire. In showing me, in my study, how the\ntwigs and wire worked on metal, he discovered that I also had the\nsame power as himself. We went outside after lunch and found\nwater near the house in several places, both where it was known\nto exist, and where it was not known to exist. We then drove\nover to Bankend, and again tried for water, and we got a splendid\nspring of first-class water at the bottom of Mr. Charteris's garden.\nMr. Houston stated that the water could be got at 5 feet from the\nsurface. A well was dug, and I measured it. It is 6 feet deep,\nand the water was standing 14 inches below the surface level of\nthe ground. Charteris says the water is first-class drinking water.\nWe also traced the source of this water in a zig-zag direction from\nabove where the well was sunk.\nWhen it was known through the district that I also had the\nsame power with a twig or wire as Mr. Houston, John Cunning\nham asked me to go over to Tarbreoch to try and find water near\nthe farm house, as their water supply had failed, and he had a\n\f1903. The Divining Rod. 87\nscheme of getting water from a distance, which would be a costly\none to carry out. I went over to Tarbreoch with the twisted wire\nI had got from Mr. Houston, and I tried in the field just above\nthe farm house for water. Very soon the wire began to work, and\ntwisted straight down in my hand, indicating a strong supply of\nwater not far off. I told Cunningham to mark the spot, and dig\nthere. Cunningham turned over a sheep trough to mark the spot,\nand we then went and tried other places round the farm steading. I\nfound good supplies of water in five or six places, which were\nmarked. John Cunningham got a man from Kirkpatrick-Durham to\n\u2022dig, and set him to work at the spot marked by the upturned\nsheep trough. When the workman had dug down 17 feet, he\ncame on a very plentiful supply of water, which has now risen to\nwithin 4 or 5 feet of the surface.\nAs water was not known to exist when I indicated this spot\nto John Cunningham (it was on the brow of a slope in a green\ngrass field), I fail to understand how this can be ascribed to\n\"conscious knavery, or to a more or less unconscious delusion.\"\nI had no idea till the wire began to be drawn in my hands towards\nthe spot, and then to twist violently and go straight down, that\nthere was water ; but now I can, from practice, blindfolded, and\npushed from behind by any one, go about till the wire tells me\nwater is near, and then I can find the spot by attraction. I've\ndone this blindfolded in several places\u2014Shoeburyness, Ashbourne,\nHartlip, Llandrindod Wells, etc. The wires also can tell me that\nwater is running under a house when you are standing one and\nsometimes two storeys above the ground.\nI can find water with forked twigs of the following wood :\nWillow, hazel, common ash, weeping ash, mountain ash (rowan),\nwhitethorn, blackthorn, holly, laburnum, laurel, and apple. I dare\nsay there are many other kinds of wood that would do as well, that\nI have not tried yet, and it appears to me that almost any forked\ntwig that is full of sap will do for the purpose of a divining rod.\nI never had any interest in water-finding till the sanitary inspec\ntor started on me with the threat of setting the County Council\nAt me to get a water supply for Charteris at Bankend, and though\nI stormed pretty freely at the time, it has turned out a wind that\nblew me some good, for now I can find water where it exists, and\nI find I can add materially to the present water supply to this\nhouse from springs close to the cistern at Paddock Hall, at present\n.untapped.\n\f88 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNB, 1903.\nI have found some people who have the power much stronger\nthan I have. One man of 82, whom I met at Llandrindod Wells,\nhad this power quite as thoroughly as it lies in myself. My son,\nJohnny, aged eight on 20th July, 1902, has the power, but none\nof the rest of the children have it so far. Dorothy can't get either\na twig or a wire to work, and she was ten years old on 20th\nAugust last.\nI have taken hold of people by one hand and made them hold\nthe wires or twigs in their left hand and held the other end in my\nright hand, and the wires or twigs will work and twist despite\nwhat any one does or wishes to do to prevent it.\nIt is quite a simple matter to take a dozen pairs of gloves be\nlonging to twelve different people, lay them at intervals apart,\nhaving taken one glove out of any pair, and then blindfolded to\ngo\u2014guided by some one\u2014over every pair till the wire comes over\nthe fellow of the glove you hold in your hand, when the wire will\nat once twist and go down to the mate of the glove in your\nhand.\nThere is no doubt that after using these twigs or wires trying\nto find water, etc., one gets very much exhausted. I have been\ntaken blindfolded over pipes and taps of water where water was\n\u2014and was known to be by people to test me\u2014and I could not pos\nsibly see these taps or pipes\u2014and the wire has always worked\naccurately. I've also made sceptics hold one end of the wire or\ntwig, while I held their right hand in my left, and the other end\nof the wire or twig in my right hand to complete the circle, and\nthe wire or twig will work despite all tbe sceptic can do to\nprevent it.\nThe only place I have ever known the wires or twigs refuse to\nwork was at Norton Hill, Runcorn, Cheshire, where the atmosphere is\nfull of chemicals from the Chemical Works at Widnes, in Cheshire,\nand where the upper limbs of all the big trees are destroyed, and\nthe grass is blackened with the chemical soot from the Widnea\nWorks for miles around. ... I have gone out of a room and\nfound a sovereign hidden in the room in my absence, and being\nblindfolded before I was brought into the room\u2014also a hidden\nglove, while holding the other glove of the pair in my hand.\nWhen I hold the wires and am in the vicinity of water, or coal,\nor metals, one feels the magnetic current strong. I saw the bark\ntwisted off a forked willow held by Tait, the late gardener here,\nwhen he tried over a place where I had found water with the wires\n\fJUNE, 1903. The Divining Rod. 89\nbefore him. I've seen two twigs I cut break with a snap in the\nhands of Colonel Paget, to whom I gave them when at Llandrindod\nWells last year, and my bauds have been made quite sore by the\nwires and twigs twisting in them over water.\nJAS. WKDDKRBURN MAXWELL.\nWith regard to his experience of water-finding, Major Max\nwell writes later to Professor Barrett :\nMarch 13HA, 1903.\nWhen I was asked by John Cunningham to go to Tarbreoch to\nsee if there was any water near the farm, I went there ignorant\nof any geological knowledge or hydro-geological knowledge ; I trusted\nentirely to the wires in my hands acting to show me indications\nof water. The field where the water was indicated was green\nall over with grass, and there were no indications of surface water\nto be seen, such as the grass growing with greater luxuriance in\none spot than in another. My sole reason for stating that a good\nsupply of water would be found at the spot where the well was\ndug, and the water found, was the strong force which the rod\nsuddenly exhibited by twisting in my hands in spite of my trying\nto prevent it.\nWriting again on May 23rd, 1903, Major Maxwell informs\nus that he has had three more places dug for water where\nthe divining wires indicated its existence to him and that\nwater was found in each case.\nThe following extracts from letters from Major Maxwell\nto Sir Oliver Lodge give further particulars of the finding of\nobjects through the divining rod,\u2014evidently by means of muscle-\nreading, as in the so-called \" willing game,\"\u2014and of experiments\ndesigned to test what conditions, if any, interfere with the\nmotion of the rod.\nThe glove experiment I have to-day shown to my sister, who\nblindfolded me in one room, and took me into the next where she\nhad placed two pairs of my gloves, and one glove of her own\u2014\ngiving me the fellow to hold in my hand with the wires, and\nI satisfied her of the accuracy of the wires in finding the\nfellow to the glove in my hand which belonged to her, while\nthe wires did not act when she took me over my own two\npairs of gloves\u2014placed in separate parts of the room.\nIt is just as easy to find a gold watch hidden in a room\u2014\n\f90 Journal of Society fw Psychical Research. JUNK, 1903,\nwhen brought blindfolded into the room, holding a piece of gold\nin one hand in which the end of the wire is held\u2014as it is to\nfind a glove when one holds its fellow in one hand. These ex\nperiments I have tried successfully\u2014but one must not try them\nwhere water or metal pipes exist under the floor or surface, as\nthe wire will work to the water or metal pipe as well.\nYou ask \"whether the interposition of gloves makes any difference.\"\nIt makes no difference whatever. I find that when I put on a\npair of kid or dog-skin gloves, the wires work just the same as\nin my naked hands.\nI take the divining rod and search for water ; suddenly I feel\na sensation from the wire that I am near water, or metal, or\ncoal. I go in the direction indicated by the divining rod till it\nsuddenly goes straight down vertically in my hands ; I then turn\nmy back on this spot and walk slowly from it, till the wire\nor divining rod ceases to act at all.\nThis is the way that water diviners can estimate the depth\nbelow the surface of the water, or metal, and, with some, it is\none foot deep for every yard measured from the spot indicated by\nthe divining rod [as one where] water exists to where the rod ceases\nto attract or work. I have not had an opportunity of testing\naccurately for myself this means of calculating the depth of water.\nIf one is not in good health, the divining rod does not work\nwith the same power as when one is well and fit. I have found\nthis to be the case myself.\nLet me tell you another experiment I tried last year. I\ncut a divining rod off a wych elm, and then whittled off the\ntwigs and leaves before using this rod. I then tried it over a\nsulphur spring, when it worked perfectly. Then I tried for a place\nwhere no water existed and where this twig would not work on\nanything else. On finding this place I took the leaves and twigs,\nwhich I had whittled off the wych elm rod and put them in\na heap, and went off about fifteen or sixteen yards and took the\nwych elm rod in my hands and approached the spot where the\nleaves and twigs were lying. As soon as I got within about a\nyard of the leaves and twigs, the rod in my hand indicated their\npresence and went down vertically at once. This is on the same\nprinciple as finding one glove with the divining rod and its fellow\nglove in your hand, or finding a gold watch or a sovereign with\na piece of gold and the divining rod in your hand. The other day\nI was blindfolded here (at Bath) on a landing outside a drawing\n\fJOKE, 1903. The Divining Rod. 91\nroom. A lady had a piece of coal in her lap and sat in one of\nthe chairs in the drawing room. I was then led into the room\nand brought over where she was sitting. The wire immediately\ntwisted in my hand and went down vertically. I was then led\nabout in the room blind-folded and in the meanwhile this lady\nhad slipped into another chair and then I was led up to where\nshe was sitting and the wire immediately went down again.\nThe handkerchief was then removed and below the wire was the\ncoal in the lady's lap !\nI have just tried a \" divining rod \" made of copper wire over\na small decanter of whisky. The decanter had the stopper (of cut\nglass) in it. I slipped a pair of woollen mittens over the shafts\nof the wire so that my naked skin did not touch the wire. The\nwire acted at once and went straight down on the top of the\ndecanter. This shows that wool will not prevent the wire work\ning. Of course you can't prevent a wire working with the woollen\nmittens round the shafts so easily as with the naked hand.\nContinuing my letter re interposition of gloves, etc., between the\nnaked hand and the divining wires, I tried the following experiment.\nTaking two sets of divining wires made of ordinary galvanised iron\nwire, I whipped them together with string so that the naked hand\ndid not touch the wires, and then tried to see if it made any\ndifference to the wires working. It made no difference whatever.\nI then put on a pair of gloves and held the wires where the\nstrings had been whipped round them and the wires just worked\nthe same as ever.\nI don't know whether you have ever heard that the position of\nthe roots of a tree under ground can be ascertained by means\nof these divining wires\u2014but this also can be done. First go\nround the tree at a distance from the bole and see that there\nis no water running under it. Then take a leaf, or end of a\ntwig, off one of the branches of the tree and hold it with the\ndivining rod and again walk round the tree and the rod will\nindicate where the roots exist.\nI showed the following experiment this afternoon to Colonel\nand Mrs. R n H n and Mr. C e, of S r. I took\nfour primroses out of a bowl and laid them on the table separately.\nI passed the divining rod over them and it took no notice of\nthe primroses. I then picked up one of the primroses and held\nit in my baud with the divining rod and passed the rod over\neach of the other three primroses, when the divining rod immediately\n\f92 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1903.\nwent down over each separate primrose. Then I took two snowdrops\nout of the bowl and placed them between the primroses. I again\npassed the rod holding a primrose in my hand over the three primroses\nand the two snowdrops. The divining rod would not move when\nover the snowdrops, but went down as before over each primrose.\nI then put down the primrose in my hand on the table and\ntook another snowdrop out of the bowl and holding it in my\nhand passed the divining rod over the four primroses and two\nsnowdrops on the table. The rod worked at once when over the\nsnowdrops, but would not move when over the primroses.\nThese experiments bear out, in a very striking manner,\nvarious conclusions arrived at by Professor Barrett in his\nreports on the subject. That the rod should work equally\nwell and in a similar manner with so great a variety of\nobjects,\u2014water, metals, coal, tree-roots, flowers, articles of\nwearing apparel,\u2014etc., shows almost conclusively that it cannot\ndepend on any physical influence or material attraction of\none object for another, since it is hardly conceivable that,\nsay, a primrose should affect the rod or not according to\nwhether another primrose is or is not held in the hand with\nthe rod. On the other hand, all the results of Major Max\nwell's experiments can be easily and simply explained by\nProfessor Barrett's theory that the rod is worked by mental\naction,\u2014that is, by the ideas, subconscious or conscious, of\nthe operator, causing an unconscious and involuntary action\nof his muscles, and perhaps revealing themselves only by this\nmeans, as the subliminal ideas of the crystal gazer are revealed\nby his crystal visions.\nIn both cases these ideas may be veridical, as when the\nrod turns over actual underground water, the existence of\nwhich was unknown to the operator, or when the crystal-\nvision represents actual events occurring at a distance ; or\nthe ideas may be merely subjective in origin, as when the\nrod turns in the absence of water, or the crystal-vision\nreproduces the conscious thoughts of the seer. The mere fact\nof the rod turning does not, of course, prove the presence\nof water, or of whatever object is being sought for, as some\ndowsers are apt to think, any more than the fact of a vision\nbeing seen in the crystal proves that its counterpart exists\nin the world.\n\fJUNK, 1903. The Divining Rod. 93\nThe turning of Major Maxwell's rods over flowers, etc.,\nseems to be due to expectancy\u2014perhaps unconscious in the\nfirst instance\u2014on his part, arising from his theory that the\naction is one of attraction of like objects for like. That this\nis the most probable explanation is shown by the fact that\nthe effect failed to be produced when he was neither aware\nof the real circumstances nor in contact with a person\nwho knew of them, as in a case which he describes as\nfollows :\nMarch 1th, 1903.\nLast night my wife placed seven cards of one pack face down\nwards on a table. One of these cards was the ace of spades. The\nseven cards had been shuffled so that neither my wife nor our\ngoverness nor I knew which was the ace of spades. Taking the\nace of spades of another pack in my hand, with a wire, I passed\nthe wire over each of the seven cards that were face downwards.\nThe wire acted equally on each of the seven cards.\nIt is always difficult for the automatist to believe that his\nautomatic actions are performed by his own muscles, since\nthe sensations accompanying them are different from those\naccompanying voluntary conscious muscular action. He may\noften, in fact, have the sensation of resisting what he is actu\nally accomplishing, and this sensation may not be altogether\nan imaginary one. That is, he may be consciously trying to\ndo one thing (to resist the motion of the rod) while he is\nunconsciously trying harder to do something else (to move it),\nand in that case he would probably be aware only of the\nsensations accompanying the conscious effort.\nThese questions are fully discussed by Professor Barrett.\nHe brings forward in his first Keport ample evidence to\nshow that the movement of the rod is due to unconscious\nmuscular action, and further that it depends on the fixed,\nbut often subconscious ideas of the dowser (see especially\nProceedings, Vol. xill., pp. 243-248). He returns to the\nsubject in his second Report, and here he quotes an inter\nesting observation by Dr. Purser as to the movements by\nwhich the rod is turned, as seen in the case of an amateur\ndowser, Mr. J. H. Jones (see Proceedings, Vol. xv., p. 288).\nDr. Purser observed that the movements consisted in a\n\f9-i Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JCNK, 1903.\nrotation of the fore-arms, or one of them, and a flexion of\nthe inner fingers, and Professor Barrett continues :\nThe breaking of the forked twig can only be accomplished by a\nrigid grasp of one of the forks, and a rotation of the twig by the\nhand holding the other fork. This is probably what occurs\u2014the\nskill and strength required to do this, without much visible motion\nof the hand, being as much beyond the conscious effort of the\ndowser as the feats of a somnambulist or hypnotised person are\nbeyond the power of the same person in his normal state ; and the\nphysiological explanation is probably much the same in the two\ncases, namely, an automatic concentration and discharge of most\nof the available nervous energy of the individual into one narrow\nchannel. Only a trained anatomist is competent to give an opinion\non this question, for he knows which muscles to observe, whilst the\nstartling effects of auto-suggestion are well known to physiologists.\nAnother problem connected with the motion of the rod\nwhich has been noticed by Major Maxwell and other dowsers\nis the curious fact that when the dowser holds the wrist or\nhand of a person with whom alone the rod will not turn, it\noften begins to move. Numerous instances of this are given\nin Professor Barrett's reports, and he observes of them (op.\ncit. p. 293):\nThere can, therefore, be no doubt about this curious fact, which\nseems to occur most conspicuously only with notable dowsers such\nas Bleton and the late J. Mullins. What is the explanation of it ?\nI expect it will be found not in the transmission of any voluntary\nor involuntary motion from the sensitive to the insensitive person\nbut in the transmission of a suggestion to the latter. If so, any\nmode of impressing such a suggestion would do as well if it be\nemphatic and indirect. The charming away of warts, of which we\nhave such striking and well authenticated instances, is a case where\nany kind of indirect suggestion will do if it be strongly impressed\non the recipient.\nThis view seems to be confirmed by the following observa\ntion of Major Maxwell's :\nI find now that one does not even require to hold a person's\nhand for the wires to work. By touching part of their clothes or\nholding a part of their dress in one's- hand, the wire works as\nsoon as the circuit is complete.\n\f1903. Automatic Drawings of Mrs. Watts. 95\nTHE AUTOMATIC DRAWINGS OF MRS. WATTS.\nTHOSE members who were present at the meeting of the\nSociety on March 13th will remember the striking series of\nautomatic drawings by Mrs. Alaric Watts (Anna Mary\nHowitt) exhibited by Mr. Douglas Murray, of which there\nwas not time at the meeting to give an account.\nThe most authentic account of the development of Mrs.\nWatts' power and of the process by which the drawings\nwere produced is to be found in two articles by herself and\nher husband published in Light for April 13th and April\n27th, 1889 (Vol. ix., p. 176 and p. 203), of which the\nfollowing is a brief summary.\nIt must be premised that Mrs. Watts\u2014living at a time\nwhen almost nothing was known of the subject of auto\nmatism :\u2014was herself convinced that both the visions she\nsaw and the drawings she made were to be attributed to\nspiritual agency. It does not appear, however, that they ever\nrepresented in an unmistakable manner any real event or\nfact unknown to her\u2014the subjects being mostly religious, or\nsymbolic figures representing faith, charity, etc.\u2014and generally\nsurrounded with or forming part of highly decorative designs.\nShe states that after practising automatic writing for\nsome time and then trying to check it, the power changed\nfrom the writing of letters and words into the delineation\nof forms. The first stage consisted in seeing \" visions \"\u2014\nwhich do not appear to have been at all fully externalised,\nbat were probably of the nature of hypnagogic hallucinations,\nseen sometimes with closed eyes, and often on waking\nsuddenly. The visions represented human figures in out\nlines of white or grey upon a darker background, upon\nwhich they stood out as if sculptured in relief. The ex\nplanation of each figure or group was given in white or\ngrey lines of writing inscribed above or below them or on\nscrolls held in their hands or on their shields, swords or\ngarments, or on a label proceeding from their lips. Three\nvisions are specially described : one was of the New Jerusalem\nrepresented as a majestic woman clothed in wonderful\n1 Her description was written in 1875, and she states that it was then\nmore than 20 years since her power had first developed.\n\f96 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1903.\ndraperies, studded with jewels, and wearing many crowns\nand a singular breastplate ; another was of an expiring Titan,\nrepresenting the end of the world ; the third was of the Last\nJudgment, a strong celestial woman hurling down into the\nabyss a Titanic man who fell smitten by the Word of\nTruth which proceeded from her mouth.\nMrs. Watts goes on to describe her endeavours to ignore\nand escape from the thought of these visions by occupying\nherself with other things, especially in drawing studies of\nflowers, etc., in which it appears that she was an adept.\nShe was, in fact, an accomplished artist in general. One\n\u2022day while sketching some irises she paused to talk to a\nfriend with her hand resting on a sheet of paper. Soon\nshe felt the pencil move as if of itself and begin to draw.\nIt drew a small initial letter with a female head attached.\nShe then remembered that the names of three artists\u2014Fra\nAngelico, Raphael and Blake\u2014used often to appear in her\nautomatic writing ; and sometimes while she was painting\nin a normal manner, these names would be written in paint\non her palette, and the writing had said that the spirits of\nthese and other painters would come to assist in the art of\nthe future. As she was thinking of this the pencil drew\nthe interlinked initials, A.R.B.\nAfter this incident she made systematic attempts to develop\nthe power of drawing automatically,\u2014regarding it as a kind\nof exercise through which religious and philosophical truths were\nconveyed symbolically to her mind. Every day for about an\nhour she sat alone in a retired part of her friend's garden with\npencil and paper, and waited to see what would come. The\nfirst drawings produced were crude and childish\u2014resembling\ngroups of figures from the earliest Byzantine, German and\nItalian artists, often accompanied with writing and sometimes\nlike a sort of missal-page of Byzantine type. These show a\ngood deal of imagination, though\u2014as continued to be the case\nthroughout\u2014the same forms and figures or types of figure con\nstantly recur. As far as execution went, they were at first\nmuch inferior to her normal drawings, but gradually improved\nup to a very high standard of artistic excellence.\nShe found for some time that the design would constantly\nchange and develop during the process of drawing, so as to\n\fJUNK, 1903. Automatic Drawings of Mrs. Watts. 97\nproduce an unfinished and complicated effect, as if several\ndesigns were mixed together in one picture ; till she hit on\nthe plan of tracing off whatever part of the outline seemed\ncomplete, and starting next time from that point instead\nof beginning afresh. In many cases automatic writing was\nassociated with the drawing, the writings being explanatory\nof the drawings. She also painted automatically, having the\ncolours prepared on her palette, and letting her hand be-\n\" guided \" to select them in turn.\nLike most automatists, she found that the power varied\na good deal at different times and under different circum\nstances \u2014 some conditions, such as bad weather or the\ninterruption of certain visitors, appearing especially adverse\u2014\nor again the power might cease, as if simply exhausted and\nfor no other apparent reason.\nIn the later years of her life it became more and more\nprecarious and liable to be interrupted by adverse conditions\nand with less and less strong apparent impulse to manifest\nitself. Mrs. Watts then occupied herself chiefly in writing\non the religious and philosophical aspects of spiritualism, and\nthe faculty of internal visualisation became more highly\ndeveloped, seeming to a great extent to take the place of\nthe faculty of automatic drawing. Mr. Myers has shown\nhow closely akin are the two forms of automatism\u2014sensory\nand motor\u2014and we often find the same person able, e.g., to\nsee visions in crystals (which it seems very likely that Mrs.\nWatts might have done if she had tried the experiment)-\nand to write automatically.\nCASES OF SUBLIMINAL MEMOEY IN DEEAMS.\n(I.) THE case which follows is the personal experience of an\nAssociate and frequent contributor to the Journal, who prefers on\nthis occasion to remain anonymous, for reasons which will, we\nthink, be obvious.\nThe full names and addresses of the persons concerned are\nknown to us.\nMiss M writes under the date of May 12th, 1902:\nI was staying from the 20th of last March until Tuesday the\n1st of April, at a place where I have been frequently and for\n\f98 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JOSE, 1903.\nmany years, called by my official inspections, and with which,\ntherefore, I am well acquainted. My recent stay there included\ntwo Sundays, Palm Sunday, the 23rd, and Easter Sunday, the 30th\nof March, on both of which days I went to services at the Parish\nChurch as usual. On the night of Monday, the 31st, I had a\nridiculous dream. I thought I was standing among a row of others\nin a front pew, next to a lady who was my governess when a\nchild, and whom I have not seen for some years, nor has anything\nrecalled her specially to my mind.\nMy governess was behaving in a very unsuitable manner, for she\ncontinued to talk and laugh aloud, in spite of my efforts to stop her.\nThereupon, the Vicar, who was standing in the reading desk immedi\nately in front of us, stepped out of it in a very angry and rude\nmanner, and came up to me, apparently with the intention of push\ning or striking me ; but I looked him up and down with such severity\nthat he contented himself with touching me with one finger. He\nthen turned his attentions to my governess, and slapped her vigorously\nwith a black glove which he held in his hand. Next day, Tuesday,\nthe 1st of April, I was discussing the Easter services with a lady\nwho has been for many years a resident in the place, and I told\nher of my absurd dream. She then said how curious it was that\nthe Vicar should persist in wearing gloves in church, and told me\nthat he always, at every service without exception, wore a glove on\none hand, carrying the other ; it had been a subject of annoyance\nto his congregation ever since he had been there.\nNow, it may seem strange that I had never myself noticed\nthis, often as I have been to the church. But I am not in the\nhabit of looking at the clergyman in church, and at this place I\ngenerally sit quite at the further end. I cannot remember, even\nnow, ever having seen the gloves, or heard any one speaking of\nthem, and I was altogether surprised at hearing that the clergyman\nwore them. I suppose I must have seen them unconsciously, and\nthat my sub-conscious knowledge came out in my dream.\nThe lady to whom Miss M narrated her dream,\nwrites on May 13th, 1902, as follows:\nI remember Miss M telling me on Tuesday, the 1st of\nApril, of her dream the night before. I told her of the Vicar's\nhabit of wearing gloves as she has described, and she told me that\nshe had never noticed his doing so. It was quite a surprise to her.\nI have read her statement, which is quite correct.\n\fJOKE, 1903. Cases of Subliminal Memory in Dreams. 99\n(II.) The following is another case which may probably be\nreferred to subliminal memory of an incident that passed\nunnoticed by the supraliminal self ; that is, the servant\nherself may in an absent-minded fit have put the cream jug\nin or near the place where she afterwards found it ; if so,\nher complete forgetfulness of the place suggests that she had\nnever been supraliminally aware of it at all.\nThe account comes from an Associate of the Society, and\nwas written, it will be observed, immediately after the\nevent. Miss Marten writes :\n78, VANBRUGH PARK, BLACKHEATH, S.E., Jan. 7th, 1903.\nI send yon an account of an incident which has just taken\nplace in my household.\nI have a silver cream jug which I value very much, as it\nbelonged to my great-grandmother ; on Christmas Day it was\nmissing. It had been used the Sunday before, and the housemaid in\nwhose charge it was thought she had put it away as usual in a\ncloset at the top of the house. She and her fellow - servant\nhunted for it without success. I have had one servant five years,\nthe other more than one ; they are both perfectly honest and\nrespectable.\nThis morning the housemaid came in excited to my friend,\nFraulein Miiller, saying she had found the jug. She told me after\nwards the same story which she told Fraulein Miiller, that she\ndreamed in the night some one told her it was on a certain box.\nThis box, a black portmanteau, stands on the landing with others,\nnear the closet where the silver is kept. The dream made such an\nimpression on her that she went to look, and on moving the boxes\nfound the jug fallen down by this special black portmanteau.\nI enclose Fraulein Miiller's account and the servant's as it was\ntaken down from her dictation. A. R. MARTEN.\nMiss Miiller gives the following statement :\nJan. 1th, 1903.\nMiss Marten has asked me to put down the following account :\nThis morning, when I was sitting in the dining-room, I heard some\nbody coming running downstairs, the door opened and Lizzie rushed\nin, beaming all over her face, high up in her hand carrying the jug.\n\" Here it is, I found it, and just there where I was told to find\nit. I dreamt of it.\" And then she told of a box, and room, and\ndream, all so quickly, and all the time laughing between the\n\f116 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1903.\noccasion (against the two other occasions noted by Mr. B.),\n\" also in the winter,\" when the figure appeared outside the\nfront door, and in describing the experience says, \" she looked\nso hard,\" \" we looked very hard at one another,\" \" she was\na young woman, very lovely, about 18 to 20 years of age.\"\nApparently the two appearances outside the front door have\nbecome merged into one composite memory ; but it may\nbe noted that whereas in the earlier record it was specifically\ndenied that the face was seen on any one of the three\noccasions, Mrs. P. thinks 17 years later that she saw the\nface of the apparition once at least.1 This, however, is but a\nvery slight addition to the essential part of the narrative.\nAgainst it may be set as examples of the minimising ten\ndency, T.'s denial in 1902 of the story of the shadow of an\nold man in his bedroom, and the less dramatic version given\nin 1902 by Mrs. C. of the behaviour of a dog. In 1885\nthe \" dog rushed downstairs pluckily enough, but only to\nreturn immediately in a state of the most abject terror.\"\nIn 1902, \"Rex barked very much, but would not leave the\nbed, and the large dog we could not move at all, he just\nlay [under the bed], and nothing would make him come\nout.\"\n'On the other hand, the almost contemporaneous second-hand account of\nMr. B. insists on the marked likeness of the apparition to the seer, a detail\nwhich is entirely absent from Mrs. P.'s own narrative, and which seems to\nhave been read into the experience by Mr. B. himself.\nNOTICE.\nThe Booms of the Society, at 20 Hanover Square, London, W.,\nwill be closed during August and the greater part of September.\n\fNOTICES.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nA General Meeting of the Society will be held in the Hall at 20 Hanover\nSquare, London, W., at the end of October or early in November, when\na paper will be read by PROFESSOR BARRETT.

The author shows how the belief in\nAmerica, the land of its birth, was incubated in the trance revelations of\nAndrew Jackson Davis : how it spread with epidemic rapidity through the\nAmerican continent, and reached Europe in 1853. Its history in this country-\nis given at length, and the book concludes with a detailed criticism of the\nchief items of evidence relied on by modern Spiritualists and the marvellous\nfeats of Eusapia Paladino, the slate writing of Egliuton, the experiments\nmade by Zollner with Slade, and by Sir W.

Dream.\nTHE following is a case of the finding of a corpse through\ninformation given in a dream. We have printed several\ncases of this type\u2014some of them much stronger evidentially\nthan this one\u2014but we print this because we were able to\nhave it very thoroughly investigated within a fortnight of\nits occurrence, so that the information we have about it is\nunusually complete and reliable. Our attention was first\ndrawn to the case through a newspaper cutting, probably\ndated April 18th, 1903, as follows:\nTwo men lost their lives in the Severn at Bewdley on March\n22, and it was not until Wednesday that the first body\u2014that\nof Stephen Price\u2014was found. At the inquest yesterday afternoon\nat Stourport, Thomas Butler, who found the body, said it was\nowing to a dream the night before that he visited the spot where\nhe found the body. It was six miles from the scene of the\nfatality. A verdict of \" Accidentally drowned \" was returned, the\ncoroner remarking on the curious circumstance of the dream.\nLieutenant-Colonel G. L. Le M. Taylor, who undertook\nthe investigation, writes as follows :\nApril 25th, 1903.\nStarting with the above information, and on consulting a map,\nI found that Kidderminster was the nearest town in which I might\nhope to find a local newspaper giving further information about\nthe case.\nI went to Kidderminster yesterday morning, and found that\nthree local papers are published in that town, namely, The Shuttle,\nThe News, and The Times. They all rely, as far as the above case\nis concerned, on the same source of information (a reporter on the\nstaff of the News, I believe), and seemingly simply copy the one\nfrom the other.\nI looked over the back numbers of the News, and found the\nfollowing information : [The first cutting sent by Colonel Taylor,\ndated March 26th, 1903, gives an account of the drowning of the\ntwo men on Sunday evening, March 22nd, Price having fallen into\nthe river by accident, and Edgington, a relief signalman on the\n\fOCT., 1903. Cases. 119\nGreat Western Railway, having gone in to rescue him. Both\nbodies were carried away and disappeared. The other cuttings\nreport the finding of Price's body, and the inquest.]\nI then went to the office of the Shuttle, from which I obtained\nthe following two cuttings :\n[From The Kidderminster Shuttle, April 18th.]\n\" On Sunday evening, March 22nd, Stephen Price, an under-\ncoachman at The Heath, Wribbenhall, whose parents reside at Love\nLane, Stonrbridge, and a young married man, Henry Edgington,\na signalman at the Bewdley Railway Station, were drowned in the\nriver Severn at Bewdley. The river was in flood at the time. The\nsad affair occurred in the darkness of the evening, and all attempts\nto recover the bodies were fruitless. A reward was offered for the\nfinding of each body. Diligent search was made along the course\nof the stream, but nothing was found until Wednesday, when it\nwas stated in Stourport that the body of a man had been seen in\nthe river just below the Lincombe weir. The body was got out of\nthe water, removed to the Stourport mortuary, and in the after\nnoon was identified by Mrs. Millward, of Wribbenhall, as that of\nStephen Price. The coroner was informed of the circumstances,\nand an inquest on the body was held at Stourport this (Friday)\nafternoon.\"\n[From The Kidderminster Shuttle, April 25th.]\n\" As briefly stated in the Shuttle last week, an inquest was held\non Friday afternoon at the Town Hall, Stourport, before Mr.\nHughes, coroner for the district, on the body of Stephen Price,\naged 17 years, of Wribbenhall, groom to Mr. Edward Smith, J.P.,\nof The Heath, Wribbenhall, who was drowned in the river Severn\nat Bewdley on Sunday evening, March 22nd, and whose body was\nfound on Wednesday morning just below Lincombe Weir, Stourport.\n\" Mrs. Millward, of Wribbenhall, said the deceased had lodged\nat her house for some time. He was employed at The Heath,\nWribbenhall, the residence of Mr. Edward Smith, J.P. He was a\nvery quiet and steady young man. She saw him last alone on the\nSunday evening, March 22nd, when he returned from The Heath.\nHe said, ' I am too late for church to-night,' and went into the\ngarden. He was in good spirits. She heard the next morning that\nhe had fallen into the river, and had seen the body at Stourport\nmortuary on Wednesday afternoon.\n\" Mrs. Preece, of Severn-side North, Bewdley, said she had seen\nthe young man as an attendant at Mr. Smith's class. On the\n\f120 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1903.\nSunday evening she was standing at the door of the entry\nleading to her cottage when she saw Price walking along the quay\nvery near the edge of the river. He was singing a church hymn.\nHe was alone, and quite suddenly he disappeared. The river was\nbank high at the time. She heard a splash of water, and thought\nthat the young man had fallen in. She saw a man coming along\nthe quay, and she told him that a young man had just fallen into\nthe river. The man ran to the public-house, and in a moment a\nnumber of men were on the quay. The current was very strong,\nand carried the body under one of the large boats. She saw Price\nwhen in the water throw up his hands, and then he totally dis\nappeared. An attempt was made to find the body, but it was\nfruitless. Price was near the landing steps when he fell into the\nwater.\n\"Thomas Butler, of Bell-row, Stourport, labourer, said on Wed\nnesday morning he went towards Shrawley Wood. On the previous\nevening he dreamt that he saw the body of a man on the top side\nof the Lincombe Weir. He went for a walk with a man, and told\nhim that he had had the dream. They went round Shrawley\nWood and returned by Hampstall Hotel, and when just below\nLincombe Weir he saw the body of a man in the water in the\nweir cutting. He got a boat and called to John Oakley, clerk at\nthe Lincombe Lock, who said that a policeman was at the lock-\nhouse. Witness rowed the boat across the river, picked up P.O.\nMonks, and took him to the spot where the body was. They put\nthe body into the boat, and it was conveyed to the mortuary.\n\"The Coroner\u2014Are you in the habit of having these realistic\ndreams ?\n\" Witness\u2014No, sir.\n\" The Coroner\u2014You might be a useful man if you were.\n\" Witness\u2014Very likely, sir.\n\" P.C. Meaks, stationed on Hartlebury Common, also gave evidence\nof the recovery of the body. He thought that the body was held\nin the upright position in which it was found by the large rocks\nin the weir. He had been to the Lincombe Lock daily since the\ntwo men were missing from Bewdley, and had made inquiries.\nThere were a few scars about the body, which had no doubt been\noccasioned by the body rolling over the weir rocks. In the clothing\nhe found a hymn book and a card.\n\" The Coroner said the dream which Butler said he had on the\nTuesday evening was a very remarkable thing. The young man\n\fOCT., 1903. Cases. 121\nseemed to have been a well-conducted and well-behaved person,\nand it was evident that he had nothing on his mind which would\nlead him to get into the water.\n\"The jury at once returned a verdict of 'Accidentally drowned.'\"\nAfter lunch I went to Stourport and walking down to the river\nhired a boat and a man to row me down to Lincombe Weir. The\nman from whom I hired the boat, speaking of the case (about\nwhich everybody seems to be interested), told me that Butler had\nbeen down river about a job with timber and on his way home\nwith some young man differed with him about the way they should\nreturn, Butler insisting on following the river because he had\ndreamed that one of the bodies, for which a reward of one pound\nwas offered, was somewhere near Lincombe Weir. He also told me\nthat there was a man at the Weir named King who most likely\nknew -where Butler was to be found, and who had been a river-\nman all his life.\nOn arrival at the Weir I found Frederick King, the man referred\nto, who showed me the place where the body was found, a place\nwhich in his opinion, he said, was a most unlikely place for it to be.\nHe described how the body [was found,] close to, or caught by a\nbush (which I saw) protruding out of the water, buried up to the\nknees in the sand and leaning over so that one hand was also\nburied\u2014something like this, I fancy [sketch enclosed].\nIn reply to questions from me he said that if he was looking\nfor a corpse in the river between Bewdley and the Weir, there\nwere three places he might expect to find it in addition to the\nslack water above the Weir. He also told me that \"The Lord\nNelson\" at Stourport was Butler's \"house of call,\" and that it was\nkept by Ward. George Eichards was the man with Butler\nwhen he found the body which he (King) assisted to get out\nof the water, and that Butler's address was Bell's BuildingSi\nStourport.\nA is where the body was found [about 200 yards below the weir\nin sketch enclosed] and B is, as far as I could make out, where\nButler dreamed it was [viz. about 100 yards above the weir].\nOn my return to Stourport I soon found the \" Lord Nelson,\" and\non speaking to Ward about Butler's dream he told me the same\nstory I had heard several times before. I asked if Butler had\nrelated his dream before finding the body. \" Oh, yes,\" he answered,\n\"he told me and several people in the morning before he found it,\nand declared his intention of looking about Lincombe on account\n\f122 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

When we came to a place a bit\nbelow the Weir then I saw it under a bush standing in the water ;\nwe got King and a policeman to help us get it out of the water\nand into a boat.\"\nI asked, \" In your dream did you see a bush and a body standing\nout of the water ? \" \" Yes, but not in the position I actually\nfound it.\" \" Did you know Price ? \" \" No, but I went to find one\nof them.\"\nThough I forgot to ask if the body was found on that side of\nthe river that Butler dreamed it to be, I gathered that it was so.\nLE M. TAYLOR.\nColonel Taylor adds:\nApril 29\/A, 1903.\nI was told that Lincombe Lock was six miles more or less from\nBewdley.\nThe Weir was of course a likely place to find the bodies, one of\nfour, I think he said, between Bewdley and Lincombe where the\nriver-man King would expect to find them.\nButler is just a labourer who takes up any job he can get, and\n\fOCT., 1903.

Dream.\nThe following premonitory dream is typical of a class of\ndreams which is probably not uncommon. The case is un\nusually well authenticated, since the dream was recorded before\nits fulfilment, and the record still exists. But it will be seen\nthat there is little or nothing in it to suggest a genuine power\nof precognition,\u2014that is, of any foresight of the future beyond\nordinary human powers of inference or guessing.\nWe first noticed the case in a paragraph in the Pall Mall\nGazette of April 7th, 1903, under the heading \"A famous\nGentleman Jockey.\u2014The Career of Mr. Thomas Pickernell,\"\n\u2014from which we extract the following :\nIn December, 1870, Mr. Pickernell received a letter from Lord\nPoulett in which the nobleman asked him to ride The Lamb in\nthe Grand National. His lordship informed him that the previous\nnight he twice dreamed that he saw the race run. The first time\nThe Lamb was last, and the second time had won by four lengths,\nand Mr. Pickernell rode him. \"Mr. Thomas,\" as he was generally\ncalled, duly rode The Lamb at Liverpool, and the horse won by\nfour lengths.\nAn Associate of the Society, Mr. Benjamin Davies, of Bir\nmingham, kindly undertook to investigate the case, and reported\nto us as follows :\nMay 23rd, 1903.\nMr. Thomas Pickernell who rode the \"Lamb\" in the Liverpool\nrace in 1871 lives at present at 16 Valentine Rd., King's Heath.\nI interviewed Mr. Pickernell at his residence on the 15th of May\nlast concerning Lord Poulett's dream. Mr. Pickernell at once\nbecame interested when I mentioned the subject, and it was evident\nthat he had always regarded the premonitory dream coupled with\nthe winning of the race as a remarkable event. Mr. Pickernell very\nkindly offered every assistance, saying that Lord Poulett's letter\nwas in his possession. He reached from a shelf a scrap book con\ntaining [a] few letters and many press notices concerning his own\n\f124 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1908.\nperformances on the race-course. Into this book Poulett's letter\nhad been gummed. Mr. Pickernell read me the letter, and on a\nsubsequent occasion (18th of May) I copied it. The following is a\ncopy of the letter:\n\"Private. \u2022 Army and Navy Club, London, S.W.\nThursday Night, Dec. \\5th [1870].\nMy dear Tommy,\nLet me know for certain if you can ride for\nme for Liverpool\u2014on The Lamb. I dreamt twice last night I saw\nthe race run. The first dream he was last and finished amongst\nthe carriages. The second dream, I should think an hour afterwards,\nI saw the Liverpool run. He won by four lengths, and you rode\nhim, and I stood above the winning post at the turn. I saw the\ncerise and blue sleeves and you as plain as I write this.\nNow let me know as soon as you can, and say nothing to\nanyone. Yours sincerely,\nPOULETT.\"\nThe letter has been slightly damaged, having got by accident\ninto the .hands of a five-year-old girl, who tore it. The letter, owing\nto this, cannot be removed from the book, but Mr. Pickernell has\nkindly offered the loan of the book should that become necessary.\nMeanwhile I have seen the letter, and here certify that the above\nis a correct copy.\nAlong with the letter in the scrap-book, there was a newspaper\ncutting giving the result of the race. Neither the name of the paper\nor its date, however, had been recorded. I therefore looked up in the\nBirmingham Public Library the newspapers of 1871, and found that\nthe cutting was taken from The Times (London) of March 22nd, 1871.\nThe description there of the last phase of the race is as follows :\n\" Pearl Diver always lay in the middle of his horses, but never\nwent to the front; while the little grey pony, always about a third\nor fourth, took the lead when fairly in the straight, and Rufus being\ndisposed of, had only to shake off Dispatch to go in a very clever\nwinner by two lengths.\"\nThe little \" grey pony \" is The Lamb. The Lamb therefore won\nby two lengths according to The Times, not by four lengths as given\nin the enclosed cutting from the Pall Mall Gazette, and as dreamt\nby Lord Poulett. But Mr. Pickernell thinks it was really by four\nlengths. This, however, is merely an impression, depending solely\non memory. Mr. Pickernell tells me that, regarded from a sporting\npoint of view, it matters little whether it was by two or by four\n\fOCT., 1903. Cases. 125\nlengths he won, and that other papers might have possibly stated\nfour lengths. The Times, however, was the only paper available at\nthe Library. I looked up the pages of the Birmingham Gazette, but\nfound the copy for the particular date required missing.\nI looked up The Times also with regard to the position The Lamb\nheld in the estimation of sporting men, which could be obtained\nfrom the betting and from the running previous to the race.\nThe betting was 6 to 1 and 5 to 1 and thereabouts against The\nLamb.\nThe following quotation taken from a description of the Liver\npool Spring Meeting shows the high position The Lamb held :\n\" Of course, there were the usual shades of opinion, but there\nwas a pretty general unanimity as to the great improvement made\nin The Doctor, the wonderful fitness of The Lamb. . . . The Lamb,\nconsidered by Lord Poulett to be 21 Ib. a better horse than he was\nin 1868, after being a good deal knocked about in the market, became\na very strong favourite in the course of last week, and disputed the\nlead with Pearl Diver.\" (The Times, March 21, 1871.)\nMr. Pickernell tells me that the entry for The Lamb had not\nbeen made at the time of the dream. B. DAVIES.\nThe sporting news in the Times for the last few days before\nthe race shows that The Lamb was steadily advancing in the\npublic favour. The Times of March 16th, 1871, says:\n\"For the Grand National, Pearl Diver proved in great\ndemand. . . . The Colonel, after being supported for a little\nat 15\u20142, receded to 8\u20141. . . . The Lamb, who had made\na marked advance at the Clubs in the morning, found friends\nat 9\u20141, about \u00a3100.\"\nOn that day, out of thirteen horses, the first three favourites\nwere Pearl Diver (11\u20142 against), The Colonel (8\u20141 against),\nand The Lamb (9\u20141 against).\nThe Times of March 20th reports that The Lamb had\nadvanced to the second place among sixteen horses, the betting\nbeing then 11\u20142 against Pearl Diver, 13\u20142 against The\nLamb, and 15\u20142 against The Colonel, and it was remarked\nthat The Lamb's supporters \" appeared to be very confident.\"\nIn the Times of March 22nd The Lamb has the second\nplace among twenty-one horses, the betting being 4\u20141 against\nPearl Diver, 5\u20141 against The Lamb, and 8\u20141 against The\nColonel.\n\f126 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1903.\nL. 1132. Crystal Vision.\nThe following apparently telepathic case of crystal vision\nwas kindly obtained for us by Miss Emily Ford of Adel\nGrange, Leeds. The account was enclosed in a letter from Miss\nFord to Sir Oliver Lodge, dated September 6th, 1903, and is\nas follows :\u2014\nOne afternoon, during the absence of ray brother in Normandy,\nI was asked to look in a ring containing a semi-transparent Persian\nstone of dark green colour. I was to think of my brother and see\nif any picture in the stone would reveal his whereabouts. After a\nfew moments of gazing with no result, I was going to hand the\nring back, when quite suddenly I distinctly saw a lovely little\nsea-piece. A lighthouse stood at the end of a ridge of rocks\nwhich were shewing well above the blue water, it being clearly\nlow tide. A little fishing vessel with dark reddish-brown sails was\nfurther out to sea to the left of the lighthouse. I was astonished\nto see it all so plainly, but thinking my brother was at Eouen,\ncould find no connexion with him. However on his return two\ndays later I told him of my experiment, when he said that he had,\nat that identical time, been looking at exactly the view I described\nfrom his hotel window at Cherbourg. It had struck him as being\nso pretty, that he called the friend with whom he was travelling\nto admire it with him. I thereupon made a rough sort of sketch\nof what I had seen and shewed it to this friend without telling him\nthe reason. He at once recognised it also. This happened about\nAugust 18th, 1898, at Alton in Hampshire. I may add that I\nhave never myself visited Cherbourg either before or after this\nincident. ADELA F. SUMNKR.\nTo this account are added the signatures of Miss Sumner's\nbrother, Mr. F. H. Sumner, of All Saints Vicarage, Alton,\nHants, and the friend who was with him at the time, Mr.\nRichard B. Knight, of Chawton, Alton, Hants, both stating\nthat they witnessed the view mentioned.\nIn reply to further questions, Miss Sumner writes :\u2014\nAll Saints Vicarage, Alton, Hants, September 9tk, 1903.\nMy brother (F. H. Sumner) says it was about 6.30 p.m. when he\nsaw the view. His friend (Rich. B. Knight) thought by signing\nhis name that he did substantiate the whole story. I am afraid\nI cannot ask him to write any more ; he is away travelling at\npresent. A. F. SUMNER.\n\fOCT., 1903. Cases. 127\nIt is probable that many persons, if they tried the experi\nment with some perseverance, might succeed in getting\noccasional telepathic impressions through crystal vision, and\nwe are always glad to receive accounts of such from our\nmembers or any other persons. To make the accounts of\nhigh evidential value, it is of course necessary that the vision\nshould have been written down in detail, with the date, and\nauthenticated by a witness, before it was known whether it\ncorresponded to any real events or not, and that the record\nshould be forthcoming afterwards.\nWe must again urge on our readers the desirability of\nmaking experiments in this way, so that the results may be\navailable for scientific purposes.\nCASE OF SUBJECTIVE HALLUCINATION.\nFROM time to time we have printed in the Journal cases\nillustrating the superior powers of observation or of memory\npossessed by the subliminal self. The following case seems\nto illustrate another mental process which is generally more\nor less subliminal,\u2014namely, the formation of mental images\nthrough association of ideas ;\u2014the hallucination evoked being\napparently traceable to the association in the percipient's mind\nof the person seen with a name sub-consciously perceived on a\ndoor.\nThe percipient was an Associate of the Society who wishes\nhis initials only to be used here. On the afternoon of April\n29th, 1902, he was present at some thought-transference ex\nperiments held at the rooms of the Society at 20 Hanover\nSquare, W., and wrote to Mr. Piddington the same evening as\nfollows :\nOn leaving you this afternoon, and in passing one of the landings,\nI thought I saw Dr. N of Hospital. He seemed to be\nstanding still, as if in thought, and carried a bag.\nAs I passed down the staircase, I wondered what he was doing\nat 20 Hanover Square, and looked at the name-board in the Hall.\nI there saw the name of the Society. Dr. N is one of\nthe senior physicians at Hospital.\nTo [the best of] my recollection I have not noticed before that\n\f1 28 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1903.\nthe Society was in your building, and on returning here I\nlooked up your last Eeport [i.e. the S.P.R. Journal] to see whether\nthere was anything there which could have guided my mind un\nconsciously. I find the names of several other tenants connected\nwith the medical profession, but none such as the Society,\nwhich might have suggested sub-consciously Dr. N .\nHowever, I have written him a letter, of which I send you a\ncopy, and will show you his reply, if there is any interest to you.\nG. M.\nThe copy is as follows :\nDear Dr. N ,\nWill you kindly 'tell me whether you were at 20 Hanover Square\nthis afternoon at 4.35 or thereabouts1)\nI will tell you my reason for asking when I receive your reply.\nApologising for troubling you, I am, dear Dr. N ,\nYours very faithfully,\nG. M.\nDr. N replied on April 2 9 :\nDear Mr. M ,\nNo, I have not been to 20 Hanover Square for some time\u2014a\nweek or more.\nYours truly,\nE. N. [assumed initials].\nOn April 30th, 1902, Mr. G M again wrote to\nDr. N as follows :\n... I will now tell you the reason of my inquiry, but please\ndon't think my mind is unhinged.\nI had been engaged in some thought-transference experiments at\nthe Rooms of the Society for Psychical Research yesterday afternoon,\nwhen on coming down the staircase I saw, or thought I saw, you\nstanding quite still, in an attitude of thought, with a bag [in your\nhands]. My first impression was one of surprise at seeing you there,\nas I had no idea that the Society had rooms there, and as\nyou seemed to disappear almost immediately, I wondered whether\nI had seen you, or was the victim of imagination. I therefore looked\nat the name-board in the hall, and found the name of the\nSociety.\nI therefore ventured to write you to clear up my doubts as to\nwhether you were there or not.\n\fOCT., 1903. Case of Subjective Hallucination. 129\nThe incident left a very curious impression on my mind, and this\nhas increased since I have received your letter . . .\nDr. N replied as follows on April 30th, 1902:\nDear Mr. M ,\nThanks for your letter of explanation. As a fact, I drove through\nHanover Square in the afternoon on my way to Hospital,\nbut at the time you named I was in the midst of a difficult operation\nin the hospital, so that the \" thought \" transference experiment was\nerroneous.1\nR N .\nMr. G M had an interview with Dr. N on\nMay 10th, 1902, and on May 12th sent the following answers\nto some questions asked by Mr. Piddington, together with a\nletter, given below, dated May 12th:\nQ. On what landing did you see the figure?\nA. I did not remember at the time, but on my next visit to 20\nHanover Square, I saw that it must have been the first floor, as 1\nwas coming down the stone staircase.\nQ. Why, if you thought it was Dr. N , did you not speak to\nhim 1\nA. No time.\nQ. Do you think the figure you saw was that of a real man\nwhom you mistook for Dr. N 1 If not, why not 1\nA. It is difficult to describe, but at first I must have thought\nthe figure real, as I said to myself \" Dr. N ! \" and wondered\nwhat he was doing there.\nQ. What happened to the figure 1 e.g. Did it suddenly dissolve ?\nor did you lose sight of it 1 or did it precede you downstairs J or\ndid it go into a room ''.\nA. It was an instantaneous vision. It did not dissolve gradually,\nbut was gone almost as soon as I saw it.\nQ. Did you pass the figure \u2022\nA. No.\nQ. When you have met Dr. N before, has he usually been\ncarrying a bag?\nA. Dr. N attended [a very near relative] in her fatal illness,\n'This reference to an experiment was, of coarse, due to a misapprehension, the\nhallucination having no connection with any experiment.\n\f130 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1908.\nand on the occasion of his first visit brought a bag. I have not\nseen him with a bag on any other occasion.\nQ. Did you know that Dr. N was a member of the\nSociety 1 or was your assumption that he naturally would be so\nstrong as to amount to a practical certainty ?\nA. No ; but when I saw the name on the board in the hall, after\nseeing the hallucination on the staircase, I thought it almost a\npractical certainty that he was a member, and I therefore began to\nthink it must have been Dr. N in reality after all, and that I\nhad missed seeing where he went to.\nQ. Have you ever had any similar experience?\nA. No.\nQ. Is Dr. N intimately known to you ?\nA. Yes.\n... I am beginning to think that I must have unconsciously\nseen the name of the Society on the door J as I came downstairs,\nand visualized, so to speak, Dr. N as [he was] when I first saw\nhim at [the deathbed of a very near relative]. I do not know\nwhether .you think that a possible explanation, but dates do not\nseem to fit any other hypothesis. . . .\nAnother possible explanation of the hallucination was sug\ngested by Mr. Piddington in a letter to Mr. M as follows :\nMay 2nd, 1902.\n. . . You had, I believe, attended some thought-transference ex\nperiments before those held on April 29. Dr. N says he had\nnot been to 20 Hanover Square for \"some time\u2014a week or more.\"\nIs it possible that your former visit to 20 Hanover Square coincided\nwith Dr. N 's last visit? You can probably discover the date\nof your former visit or visits (it must anyhow be in the notes of\nthe thought-transference experiments), and you might try to learn\nfrom Dr. N the precise date of his last visit previous to April\n29. ... Supposing that you both appear to have been at 20\nHanover Square on the same day and about the same time, it\ncould be supposed that you did see him, though not consciously ;\nand that when you were walking down the stairs on April 29 your\nhitherto sub-conscious perception of Dr. N was vividly revived\nby the surroundings, and became consciously externalised as a\nhallucination.\n1 The rooms of the Society are on the first floor, and the name is painted\nprominently on one of the doors there.\n\fOCT., 1903. Obituary. 131\nOn enquiry, however, it turned out that Dr. N had\nbeen at 20 Hanover Square on April 21st, but not on the\nfollowing day, which was the date of Mr. M 's first\nvisit to the S.P.E. rooms.\nOBITUARY.\nDR. R. OSGOOD MASON.\nIN the sudden death, early in May, of Dr. Rufus Osgood\nMason, the American Branch of the S.P.R. has lost one\nof its most valued members. As is well known to readers\nof our Proceedings and Journals, Dr. Mason's interest in all\npsychical subjects was keen and sincere. His two books,\nTelepathy and (he Subliminal Self and Hypnotism and Suggestion\n(reviewed in Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 610, and Vol. XVII.,\np. 265) are models of impartiality and clarity of style; and\nthe former of these, at any rate, might well form a useful\n\" primer \" (if the term be allowable) of psychical research.\nDr. Mason occasionally contributed to our Journal, and wrote\nmany articles at various times on the subjects of hypnotism\nand suggestion\u2014especially in their therapeutic aspect\u2014double\npersonality, etc., for some of the leading scientific and\nmedical journals in America. Shortly before his death, he\nalso wrote two long reviews of Myers' Human Personality\nfor the New York Times (Literary Supplement). For a busy\npractising physician this evidences no little interest in a\nmatter so obscure and unprofitable. Some of Dr. Mason's\nexperiments in hypnotism, however, actually antedated those\nof the famous Charcot, and he was evidently a serious student\nof psychical phenomena even prior to the foundation of the\nS.P.R.\nTo those of us who had the pleasure of knowing Dr. Mason\npersonally, his loss represents not only that of a sincere\nworker, and an enthusiastic, yet critical, student ; but also\nthat of a loving spirit, a charming personality, and a true\nfriend.

OCT., 1903.\nNOTE ON THE ALLEGED PREDICTION\nOF THE SERVIAN MURDERS.\nIMMEDIATELY after the assassination of the King and Queen of\nServia in the middle of last June, statements appeared in several\nnewspapers that the event had been predicted about three months\nbeforehand by a medium, Mrs. Burchell, at a se'ance held under\nthe auspices of Mr. W. T. Stead, the Editor of The Review of\nReviews. Mr. Stead brought the case to our notice and kindly\noffered us information about it, stating, however, that he was\n\" not very sanguine as to any results following,\" and that \" no\nnotes were taken at the time.\"\nThe main facts asserted were that in March last Mrs. Burchell\npredicted a violent death for a king, while holding in her hand\nan envelope containing a piece of paper with the signature of\nKing Alexander of Servia. On this occurrence being reported\nto the Servian Minister in London (who was, as he afterwards\ninformed us, already very anxious about the state of affairs in\nServia), he made a note of it in his diary, and wrote to urge his\nRoyal Master to be careful.\nOur preliminary enquiries concerning this at first sight inter\nesting case, however, revealed fundamental defects in the evidence,\nwhen considered critically, so that it became our opinion that\nthere was no primd facie case for thorough investigation, and\nthe enquiry was therefore discontinued. This course seemed\namply justified by a consideration of the evidence for the case,\nas presented by Mr. Stead in the July Review of Reviews.\nMr. Stead, however, attacks the officers of the Society in the\nAugust number of his magazine for dropping the investigation.\nIn the September number of the Review of Reviews Sir Oliver\nLodge defends the attitude of the Society on general grounds,\nand in Light, of September 19th, Mr. Piddington discusses in\ndetail Mr. Stead's evidence for the prediction.

CLOSE.\nWE have recently lost through death at the ripe age of 81,\none of the most learned members of our Society, who was from\nits foundation a generous supporter and warm friend. The\nname of the Rev. Maxwell Close was probably unknown except\nto a very small circle of our members, but those who had the\nprivilege of his friendship knew him to be a man of singular\nintellectual power, whose knowledge of many subjects was as\nprofound as it was wide, and withal a man of such unassum\ning modesty that he shrank from any recognition of the\nservices he rendered to science, so that some of his most\noriginal work was published under an assumed name. And\nnot only was his learning great, his sympathies were equally\nwide and his charities innumerable ; 1 have sometimes been\nhis almoner, but he never allowed the recipient to know from\nwhom the bequest had come.\nThe Maxwell Closes are a well-known Irish family, and\nthe Rev. Maxwell Close, except for a few years' clerical work\nin England, lived all his life and died in Dublin. The range\nof his learning may be surmised from the fact that he won\nDivinity honours after graduating at Trinity College, Dublin,\nwas a considerable classical and Hebrew scholar, was versed\nin the Irish language, the strange script of which he wrote\nwith great beauty, and took an active and generous part in\nthe Celtic revival. But his chief interest and studies were in\nmathematics and science ; his valuable contributions to geology\nled to his being elected President of the Geological Society of\nIreland. He was one of the highest authorities on the ancient\nglaciation of Ireland ; he published original papers on astronomy,\nand wrote a brief treatise on this subject, entitled \" Chapters\non Astronomy by Claudius Kennedy \" ; whilst under the name\nof Laurence O'Toole he issued a remarkably able tractate on\n\" Force,\" in which he broke a lance with some of the leaders\nof science ! Owing to the fact that these publications are\nknown only to a few, they have not received the attention\nthey deserve from scientific men ; their pages are full of\noriginal thought and marked with that learning and historical\n\fNov., 1903. Obituary. 135\nknowledge which distinguished Maxwell Close. So much was\nhis opinion and criticism valued that he was constantly asked to\nread the proof sheets and revise the works of eminent writers\non various scientific subjects ; this labour he freely undertook\nand carried out with unwearied care. But the great work of\nthe latter part of his life was at the Royal Irish Academy,\nwhere he held the post of Hon. Treasurer for many years, and\ndaily devoted himself to the business of the Academy.\nHis interest in Psychical Research was profound and he\nfollowed its development with the deepest interest. It is no\nlittle testimony to the soundness of the work done by our\nSociety that a man of such erudition and critical judgment as\nMaxwell Close accepted even advanced views on Psychical\nsubjects, and had the highest opinion of the importance of\nour work and its supreme value in the evolution of human\nthought. W. F. B.\nCASES.\nG. 274. Apparition.\nIN the following case, a person who had recently died was\nbelieved to have been seen by an acquaintance who was\nunaware of her death. It is impossible to prove that it\nwas not a case of misrecognition, but the details tend to show\nthat this explanation is at least improbable. The case was sent\nto us by Mr. Ernest G. Henham, who writes :\nBEKESBOURNE, WALLINGFORD, BERKS., June Mi, [1903.]\nAfter a good deal of deliberation I have resolved to send you the\nfollowing experience :\nI was a student at St. Edward's School, Oxford, from autumn\n1881 to Easter 1890, and during that long period Miss S. [full\nname given] (the well-known philanthropist) was constantly at the\nschool, being a great friend of the then Warden (the Rev. A. B.\nSimeon, well known in Oxford High Church circles). Of course I\nsaw Miss S. constantly, often several times in one week. She was\nfor many years perhaps the best-known figure in Oxford.\nI was abroad from 1890 to Christmas 1894. In July, 1899, I\ncame to live here, and in November of that year bicycled from\nhere to Oxford to visit my old school, not having entered Oxford\nsince Easter 1890. As I approached the Martyrs' Memorial I saw\n\f136 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1903.\nMiss S. She passed a very little way ahead of me, across the\nroad, towards the Ashmolean, with her usual brisk and active style,\nthe inevitable basket upon her arm. I don't suppose I had given\nthe good lady a thought during the past nine years or so, but I\nwas very pleased to see her there, having seen no other familiar\nface during my ride through Oxford. I know I was surprised to\nsee her looking so well and strong and active despite her years,\nand I slowed up, feeling a strong desire to speak to her, but on\nreaching the pavement where Beaumont Street begins, I lost sight\nof her in the crowd.\nThat incident of meeting with Miss S. always stood out very\nstrongly in my memory (which is an exceptionally powerful one),\nbut I thought little of it until about a month ago her life came\ninto my hands (published by John Murray, 1902). While turning\nover the pages something seemed to say to me, \" It was her spirit\nyou saw that day.\" Immediately I looked up the date of her death\nand found she had passed over on Friday, the 5th (or perhaps it\nwas the 6th\u2014I have not got the book now) of October, 1899. It\nwas at 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 15th November, that I saw her in\nOxford, more than a mouth later.\nI must own I took no particular interest in Miss S., and really\nhad no wish to see her, incarnate or otherwise. I need scarcely\nadd I did not at the time know she was dead, and I certainly was\nnot thinking of her, even remotely. . . .\nERNEST G. HENHAM.\nIn reply to inquiries, Mr. Henham gave us the following\nfurther details :\nBEKESBOURNE, WALLINGFORD, BERKS., June l&th, [1903.]\nI have your letter of yesterday's date relating to mine of June 9th,\nin which I recounted to you my experience of seeing the apparition\nof Miss S. in Oxford on November 15th, 1899. In regard to the\nquestions contained in your letter I beg to reply as follows :\nThere was no possible doubt about the identity\u2014if I may so use\nthe word in this connection. I have such a strong memory that if\nI only pass a person on the street, I remember the face if I see\nit again. Besides, Miss S., once seen, could never be mistaken for\nany one else. Any one in Oxford would tell you that. I was very\nclose to her and saw her face. I remember noticing that it was\nvery white, also that she took no notice of any one\u2014nor of the\ntraffic\u2014and was walking faster than I had ever known her to do.\nIt was not like her to disregard passers-by. She was dressed as I\n\fNov., i9oa Cases. 137\nhad always seen her and carrying her customary basket. There\nmay be many old ladies like Miss S. in temperament, but I have\nseen none at all resembling her in appearance. It was she beyond\nall question. I may mention that I have rather peculiar eyesight,\nmore powerful I suppose than is ordinary, because it enables me to\nsee in the dark,\u2014not with absolute clearness, of course, but I am\nable to distinguish outlines. I have always boasted of possessing\n\"night eyes.\"\nI regret to say it is impossible for me to produce witnesses.\nNaturally I had no cause for astonishment at meeting with Miss S.,\nnot knowing her to be dead. I remember mentioning to an aunt\nwith whom I live, in an off-hand manner, that I had seen the good\nold lady, but my aunt is an old woman who remembers nothing.\nAbout the date there is absolutely no doubt. I knew that the day\nwas Wednesday, but could not remember whether it was the end\nof October or beginning of November. Fortunately my aunt keeps\na diary, and often puts down my little expeditions, and it was from\nher diary that I discovered the day was November 15, and as I\nremember reaching my destination (Summertown) about 3.15, it\nmust roughly have been 3 when I saw Miss S.\nHowever, I can prove the date in another way. It is a weari\nsome journey from here to Oxford by train, and though I have\noften been to Oxford I have always bicycled. I came to live here\nin July, 1899, and being a horseman I had then a hatred for bicycles.\nBut after a time I saw that to a dweller in the country a machine\nwas indispensable, and being unable to keep a horse I resolved on\ngetting a bicycle. So one day I went to 'Reading, bought a machine,\nand paid cash for it. Fortunately I have still the receipt, and it\nis dated October 3rd. Miss S. died on the 5th (or 6th) of October.\nI did not begin to learn to ride until several days after I bought\nthe bicycle. I was certainly on the machine when I saw the appari\ntion. Therefore, even if the date of November loth had not been\nrecorded, here you have conclusive evidence that I could not have\nvisited Oxford until after Miss S.'s death. . . .\nERNEST G. HKNHAM.\nWe have verified the date of Miss S.'s death, which was\nOctober 6th, 1899. With regard to her personal appearance,\nMr. E. N. Bennett writes :\nI knew Miss S. personally. She was a woman of strongly\nmarked individuality and strongly marked features,\u2014a familiar figure\nin Oxford and not easy to mistake.\n\f138 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1903.\nL. 1133. Dream.\nIn January, 1903, Mr. A. H. Atkins of 3 Clarendon Park,\nTorquay, sent us an account of several apparently telepathic\nexperiences that had occurred in his own family, among which\nwas the following :\u2014\nWhen my daughter returned from Switzerland she was accom\npanied by a schoolfellow who was going to a situation at London\nas governess. On reaching England they parted and never met\nagain. Once only my daughter heard of her that she was married.\nNow, my daughter who lives in Birmingham still, struck up a very\nwarm friendship with another schoolfellow and they correspond\nregularly.\nTowards the end of last year [i.e. 1902] she dreamt that she saw\nthe girl who came to England with her and her husband. They\nappeared well and in very good circumstances. By the next post\ncame a letter from her Swiss friend saying that Alice Birman\n(now Mrs. Smith) and her husband had called on her without any\nwarning. They were very well off and had a sudden whim to go\non the Continent, followed by another to call on her old friend.\nMy daughter at once wrote for a description of Mr. Smith, and it\ncorresponded singularly with the visionary gentleman. In the dream\nhe was fair, with a gentle air, and shorter than his wife, and had\na slight, fair moustache, and also told my daughter they were\ngoing to an exhibition. In reality he was the same, only clean\nshaven, and they were going that day to show a dog at an\nexhibition.\nI may add that my daughter sent me the description of the\ndream Mr. Smith before she received that of the real one, and\nbefore she opened [the] first letter was convinced it would say some\nthing about [the incidents of her dream].\nOn May 5th, 1903, Mr. Atkins sent us the following letter\nfrom his daughter, to whom he had transmitted a series of\nquestions at our request.\n29 Gower Street, Aston, Monday evening.\nDear Father,\nRe the enclosed papers I herewith give you a signed\ndescription of the whole matter, and luckily I have found the letter\nfrom Sophie which I received the morning of my dream. . . .\nOf course I have not my letter asking for a description of Mr.\nSmith, but I enclose Sophie's comment thereupon.\n\fNov., 1903. Cases. 139\nI did not mention my dream to any one before reading the\nletter, but I told Mrs. Edwards at our office of the remarkable\ncoincidence.\nI put in my letter to Sophie detailing my dream \" Mr. Smith of\nmy dream was an inch or two shorter than Alice [his wife], fair\nmoustache and skin, gentlemanly and quiet behaviour.\" There is no\ncorroborative evidence, unless I described him to you whilst waiting\nSophie's reply.\nI did not in any way connect my dream of Mr. and Mrs. Smith\nwith Sophie.\nI had never seen or heard anything of Mr. Smith except that\nAlice Birman had married a Mr. Smith.\nWith the above letter were enclosed\n(1) A letter dated October 27th, 1902, in which Miss\nEdith Atkins first mentioned her dream to her\nparents.\n(2) A letter dated January 13th, 1903, addressed by Miss\nAtkins to her parents after the receipt of a letter from\nMile. Sophie Niederhauser, her Swiss friend.\n(3) Copy of an extract from the letter received by Miss\nAtkins the morning after her dream from Miss Sophie\nNiederhauser, of Aarau, Switzerland, and dated 23rd\nOctober, 1902.\n(4) Copy of an extract from a letter addressed by Miss\nNiederhauser to Miss Atkins in reply to her enquiries\nfor a personal description of Mr. Smith. The letter is\ndated merely \"Nov. 1902.\"\nThese are printed below. Miss Niederhauser's letters were in\nFrench, but are here translated.\n(1) October 27th, 1902.\n. . . Talking about dreams, Sophie's letter adds one to the very\ncurious list of coincidences in this respect, to wit :\u2014I had not\nthought or heard anything of Alice Birman or Smith as she is now\nsince her marriage ; I only knew she was married to a man named\nSmith about two years ago. Well, Friday night I dreamt I met\nher with her husband, and she seemed to be in a flourishing\ncondition, both exceedingly well dressed ; they were staying at a\nhotel in the place where we met them, where it was I don't know,\nand they were going to some exhibition or other. I remarked to\nMa in my dream, she being with me, \"Alice seems to have done\n\f140 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. NOV.,\nwell, she has just the same ideas as before.\" There endeth my\ndream ; I woke up, dressed, and went downstairs Saturday morning,\nwhere I found a letter from Sophie awaiting me, and almost at the\noutset of her letter she informs me that Alice and her husband\ncalled on them suddenly last Saturday week. They are very well\nto do, and keep three servants, and were just having a little trip\non the Continent, having made up their minds quite suddenly to\ndo so ; they were staying at a hotel in Aarau, and also Alice is\nexhibiting one of her dogs in a dog show in London this week.\nWhile reading this epistle it seemed to me that I was reading\nsomething I already knew quite well. Rather a remarkable coinci\ndence, that ! I am going to give Sophie a description of her\nhusband as I saw him in the dream, and I quite expect it will\ntally with that of the real man.\n(2) January IZth, 1903.\n. . . Alice Birman Smith's husband corresponded with my dream\nin that he is very fair, with delicate features and a gentle\ndemeanour and smaller than Alice ; only in my dream he was only\nslightly smaller than Alice, whereas he would appear to be a good\ndeal smaller, and Sophie says he is clean-shaved, and I dreamt he\nhad a fair moustache. Of course, if I were to see the man I could\ntell in an instant if he resembled my dream, and at all events,\nconsidering I had not the slightest idea of what he was like, my\ndream was fairly accurate, and besides that the incidents resembled\nvery much the way that Sophie saw Alice ; to wit, they were\nstaying at a hotel, called on Sophie quite unexpectedly, both\ntogether, and were going to an exhibition to show a dog; the only\ndifference in my dream was that I met them in the road ; all the\nother particulars were correct. What strikes me as more wonderful,\nthough, was the feeling when I read Sophie's letter that I already\nknew what she was telling me, a feeling perfectly clear and strong;\nthat I think is the strongest proof of brain communication, far\nmore important than the exact accuracy of the details.\n(3) Letter from Miss Sophie Niederhauser, October 23rd, 1902.\nOn Sunday I had visitors from England\u2014can you guess whom ?\nAlice Birman\u2014now Mrs. Smith\u2014with her husband. They came\nhere quite unexpectedly and as we have only one bed for visitors,\nthey were obliged to go to the hotel. They took tea with us at\nfour o'clock but dined at the hotel. They came at ten o'clock on\n\fNov., 1903. Cases. 141\nSaturday evening and went away at nine on Monday morning.\nFor a long time I had heard nothing of Alice.\nAlice has three servants in her household\u2014a cook, a housemaid,\nand a nurse. Mr. Smith does not speak German ; he is an agree\nable man, so gentle and amiable. They seem to live like children,\nhappy and affectionate. They had decided to come to Switzerland\nsuddenly, one evening. Mr. Smith brought home the tickets and\nthey set off the same night. Alice's child is ten weeks old ; he is\ncalled O. F. Alice is just as she always was ; she is quite different\nfrom our other friends. She went on to Zurich, Lucerne, Bale, and\nParis, from whence she is going home this morning. On Friday\nmorning she is to go to a dog show in London with one of her\nthree dogs. I have her photograph in which she has on one side\nher baby, a beautiful child, and on the other a very fine dog. She\nseemed a little older than before. . . . The visit was over so quickly\nthat I almost feel as if I had dreamt it.\n(4) Second letter from Miss Sophie Niederhauser, November, 1 902.\nIt is certainly very curious that you dreamt of Alice before\ngetting my letter. Alice's husband is smaller than she,\u2014about as\ntall as your brother, I think,\u2014and he is very fair, with delicate\nfeatures, and no moustache ; has good manners, and a rather fair\ncomplexion.\nAPPARENT PREMONITIONS.\nWHETHER or not genuine premonitions, in the strict sense of\nthe word, ever occur, is still uncertain ; but we certainly\nmeet occasionally with sporadic phenomena simulating this\ncharacter, which it is difficult to ascribe to anything but\nchance coincidence. Two instances of this type are given\nbelow.\nI.\nIn \"M.A.P.\" for June 6th, 1903, it was related that\nCaptain Robert Marshall had dreamt beforehand that \" Sir\nHugo\" was the winner of the 1892 Derby, and had backed\nhis dream, although \" Sir Hugo \" was a rank outsider. In con\nsequence of this statement we wrote to Captain Marshall on\nJune 24th, 1903, asking the following questions, to which\nhis replies are appended :\n\f142 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1903.\n(1) Did you speak of your dream to any one before the race?\nand if so to whom 1 Ans. To several brother officers and others,\nMajor Bruce, Captain Fedden, etc.\n(2) Have you ever before or since dreamt about a horse-race ?\nAns. No.\n(3) Was the dream in question a particularly vivid or impressive\none ') Ans. Yes.\n(4) Have you on any other occasion acted on a dream 1 Ans. No.\n(5) Did you act on this dream because you thought it would\ncome true, or in a half joking spirit ? Ans. Because I felt a curious\ncertainty about it.\n(6) Have you ever had any other dream that has proved\n\" veridical \" 1 Ans. No.\n(7) Had you any special interest in 'this Derby, and had you\nany reason to suppose that Sir Hugo was a better horse than\nmight have been inferred from the state of the betting? Ans. No.\nI did not even know such a horse was entered.\n(8) Did you (if this is not too impertinent a question) back your\ndream fancy for such an amount as you would not have cared to\nhave lost? Ans. Yes. R. MARSHALL.\nIn the sporting news of the Times for June 1st, 1892,\nthe betting on the Derby on the previous day (May 31st)\nis given. Eleven horses were entered, and of these \" Sir\nHugo\" came 10th on the list, the betting being 50 to 1\nagainst him. It was stated that\n. . . Nothing occurred which could be construed as having the\nslightest bearing on the Derby, unless it was the victory of Lord\nBradford's \" Cuttlestone,\" who has been the trial horse of Sir Hugo.\n... El Diablo and Sir Hugo are reported to be much fitter than\nwhen they ran for the Two Thousand a month ago.\nThe Times, June 2nd, 1892, gives the following in its\nleading article :\nWe had yesterday a beautiful Derby Day, and an eventful\nDerby. . . . The race was won by an outsider. . . . No one knew\nwho was to win . . . and \" bar one \" it was anybody's race. . . .\nA few, a very few, supported Sir Hugo, whose good looks were\nas much in his favour as his public record was against him. Three\ntimes at least had this handsome creature been well beaten ; in the\nChampagne Stakes, in the Middle Park Plate, and in the Two\nThousand. ... On the other hand Lord Bradford is a sportsman\n\fNov., 1903. Apparent Premonition. 143\nwho cannot for a moment be suspected of allowing his horse to run\nbelow his merits, and if the horse is to win, it must be either\nbecause he was fairly improved or because the Derby course will\nsuit him better than the Two Thousand course.\nWhen it came to the race, Kueil, said to be the best of the\nFrench horses, was so unfortunate as to start very badly, and his\nchance was early extinguished. The struggle resolved itself into\none between Sir Hugo and La Fleche, in which the horse had the\nadvantage throughout, winning with comparative ease by nearly a\nlength. The result was not surprise ; it was amazement. The\nrankest outsider since the days of Hermit or Caractacus had won ;\nand what was more, he was a horse who had been thrice beaten,\neasily beaten, by his now defeated opponents. The public was so\nnonplussed\u2014 and had perhaps lost so many bets\u2014that it would not\neven cheer, though Lord Bradford is a popular owner, who till now\nhas been unfortunate.\nThe \" Sporting Intelligence \" of the same paper says :\n. . . Nothing was more admired, as far as shape and make go,\nthan Sir Hugo, but so he had been in the Birdcage previous to\nthe Two Thousand, and those who had most to say in his favour\nwere bound to admit that he could have no earthly chance on\npaper, seeing that he had been decisively beaten by several of the\nhorses he had to meet. . . .\nIn the betting of the same date, \"Sir Hugo\" comes 10th in\nthe list out of thirteen horses, the betting being 40 to 1\nagainst him ; in the \" place betting \" it had fallen to 5 to 1\nagainst him. It seems thus clear that his chance of winning\nappeared very remote.\nWe then wrote to Captain C. A. Fedden, to whom Captain\nMarshall had referred us for corroboration, and he replied as\nfollows :\nDRILL HALL, HALIFAX, 22\u00abd July, 1903.\n... I have pleasure in attaching overleaf my remembrance of\nCaptain Robert Marshall's dream concerning the winner of the\nDerby in 1891 or 1892. I have no means at hand of fixing the\nyear nearer, but it was the year that \" Sir Hugo \" won the race,\nstarting at the outside price of 40 or 50 to 1. I backed it at, I\nthink, 50\u20141 a few days before the race.\nCLEMENT A. FEDDEN,\nCapt. , West Biding Regiment.\n\f144 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1903.\nIn the year 1891 or 1892, I cannot say which, but it was the\nyear in which \"Sir Hugo\" won the Derby, I was stationed at\nHalifax Barracks; Captain Robert Marshall of my regiment was\nstationed there also.\nA few days before the Derby was to be run, Captain Marshall\ncame in to breakfast in the mess, and said he had dreamt the\nwinner of the Derby, that he had seen the race run, and had heard\nthe crowd shouting the horse's name.\nOn being asked the horse's name, he said he could not remember,\nbut would know it, if he heard it.\nWe accordingly read out the names of the horses mentioned in\nthe betting from a newspaper, but he said the name was not there.\nThe next day we looked in the paper again, and read out amongst\nother names of horses that of \" Sir Hugo,\" which was not\nmentioned in the issue of the previous day.1\nImmediately the name \"Sir Hugo\" was mentioned, Captain\nMarshall said, \"That is the horse, that is the one I saw win in my\ndream, I shall back it. I heard the crowd shouting out, ' Hugo\nVictor,' 'Hugo Victor.'\"\nCaptain Marshall backed \"Sir Hugo\" to win, and persuaded me\nto do the same, so positive was he, though I was very sceptical.\nIt is a matter of history that \"Sir Hugo\" won.\nCaptain Marshall informed me that before going to sleep on the\nnight in which his dream occurred, he was reading a book by\nVictor Hugo. c A FEDDEN,\nCapt., West Riding Regiment.\nWe sent this account to Captain Marshall, who wrote :\nThe above, with the exception noted, is correct. It may also be\nof interest to state that on the day of the race, Captain Fedden\nand I left barracks together shortly after 3 p.m. On leaving the\nbarrack gate, I saw, half a mile off, one of the town buses. I\nstopped at once, and said to Captain F., \" You see the driver of that\nbus? He will tell us that Sir Hugo has won the Derby.\" When\nthe bus came along side of us, I stopped. The driver pulled up,\nand said, \" Have you heard the winner of the Derby, sir ? \" I\nreplied, \"No.\" He then said, \"Sir Hugo.\" The driver knew us\n1 To this statement, Captain Marshall adds the following note : \"I remem\nbered the name ' Hugo ' perfectly, but did not know if a horse of that name\nexisted. I think, therefore, the lines [from \"On being asked\" to this point]\nare inaccurate.\"\n\fNov., 1903. Apparent Premonition. 145\nas officers of the garrison, and naturally supposed we would be\nglad to hear the result of the race. But my conviction that he\nwould tell us was so strong, that I think I may say I knew he\nwould. R. MARSHALL.\nCaptain Marshall adds :\nBERKELEY HOUSE, BERKELEY SQUARE, W., 5th Aug., 1903.\nI return Captain Fedden's statements with my comments thereon.\nThere appears to me really nothing in the whole story except\ncoincidence of suggestion. The Derby is impending. I read a book\nby Victor Hugo in bed. My last half-waking thoughts are possibly\nof the race, jumbled with thoughts of the author whose work I\nhad been reading. Result : I dream of a race, and hear shouts of\nHugo ! Victor ! And who shall number the similar dreams that do\nnot end so happily for the unfortunate dreamer who backs his\nphantom horse. . . .\nII.\nThe second case is related by Mr. A. B. Gough, a friend\nof Mr. N. W. Thomas, who tells us that he heard the story\nat the time. Mr. Gough writes :\nMay llth, 1902.\nOn the evening of Wednesday, the 7th of May, 1902, I went to\nthe Schiller Theater at Kiel, and saw the premiere of Karl Bleibtreu's\nhistorical drama, Zorndorf. The action takes place in a house in\nthe village during the battle, and an almost incessant cannonade is\nheard. The red glare of burning houses is visible through the\nwindow. A messenger describes an explosion which took place\nduring the battle.\nAfterwards I went to a bodega with K and H , and drank\na glass of sherry, another of vermouth, and another of port, which\nmade me rather talkative, but I was perfectly sober. I went to\nbed about 1.30, and soon fell asleep.\nI dreamt I was in my bedroom at home at Redhill. It was\nnight. I looked out of the window and saw a red glare, accom\npanied by a terrific noise, as of a stupendous explosion. I had a\nvery vivid impression that an appalling disaster had occurred, and\nthat a whole town, or perhaps several, had been annihilated. I\nimagined that a piece of the earth's crust had been blown out, or\nin, and that in some way it was due to human carelessness. Almost\nimmediately after the explosion I saw newspaper boys running up the\n\f146 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1903.\nroad with special editions. 1 woke, and found myself trembling,\nand very excited. It was either dawn or daylight, I forget which.\nI dozed off, and saw an open newspaper with enormous headlines,\nbut do not remember what the words were. My idea now was\nthat Brighton (where I spent a day in the Easter vacation) was\ndestroyed. I also thought I was in the garden at home with a box\nfull of loose dynamite, and that my brother placed it in the cellar,\nwhereat I protested.\nI don't think in the first dream there was any thought of\ndynamite, and certainly not of a battle, though, no doubt, the\nimpression made by the glare of the burning houses in the play\nsuggested part of the dream. The dynamite in the cellar was also\ndue to the passage in the play, where some one blames the\nRussians for their recklessness in blowing up the ammunition which\nwas stored in a cellar. (I didn't quite catch the drift of this story,\nwhich was spoken very fast.)\nI think I was half awake when I imagined Brighton to be the\nscene of the disaster.\nIt was nearly 11 a.m. before I rose, but I had been more or less\nawake for about an hour. I was rather sleepy in the morning,\nbut had no headache.\nThe eruption of Mt. Pelee, which overwhelmed St. Pierre, took\nplace between 7 and 8 a.m. on the 8th, which would be about\n12\u20141 mid-day by Berlin time, i.e. at least 3 or 4 hours after the\n<lream. A. B. GOUGH.\nP.S.\u2014May 14<\/i. Magnetic disturbances were noted at the Kiel\nObservatory both on Wednesday and Thursday. It is thought these\nmay be connected with the eruption.\nThe dream was one of the most vivid I have ever had.\nNov. 26lh, 1902.\nI thought the foregoing account might possibly interest you,\nalthough I don't suppose there is anything more in it than a coin\ncidence. It shows, at any rate, how important it is in such cases\nto state the circumstances under which the experience took place.\nI have heard since, I believe, that the most violent disturbance\npreceded the fatal outbreak by some hours.\nIn both these cases it is to be noted that the coincidence is\nnot so much between the dream and the future event as between\nthe train of circumstances leading up to the dream and the future\nevent. It was an accidental coincidence that Captain Marshall\n\fNov., 1903. Mrs. Verrall's Automatic Writing. 147\nwas reading a book by Victor Hugo shortly before \" Sir Hugo \"\nwas victor, and that Mr. Gough heard theatrical cannonading\nat about the time of the eruption of Mount Petee ; but the\ndreams were clearly connected with the previous impressions of\nthe dreamers, rather than with the external events that followed.\nUNIDENTIFIED NAMES IN MRS. VEKRALL'S\nAUTOMATIC WRITING.\nIN the course of her automatic writing Mrs. Verrall has found\nthat a certain number of names occur to which at present she\nhas no clue. These names may, of course, be merely subliminal\nreminiscences of names which she has read or heard. But since\nwe sometimes find after careful researches that automatic utter\nances at first sight trivial and meaningless turn out to have some\nsignificance, it seems worth while to print these names with their\ncontext in the Journal, on the chance that some reader may be\nable to show a connection of any of them with external facts.\nMrs. Verrall writes with regard to them : \" I have not put down\na few names which seem to be attempts at something that has\nnot come out, but I have included all the unknown names which\nseem as if they were meant to be identified.\" They are as\nfollows :\nList of unidentified names occurring in script between March, 1901,\nand September, 1903.\n(1) 'Frendsham or Frettisham Park, perhaps Frodsham, a place\nwhere something once happened to me.' (Signature) Alec. K.\n'At Frodsham there is an old house gabled in a garden.'\n'Frodsham and a river in the winter\u2014it was frozen. Alec Keith\u2014\nto the friend of another.'\n'Frodsham. The house was in a park\u2014water belongs somehow\u2014I\nthink it was a skating accident. The message came through\nAlec.'\n(2) ' Rodney, Roland, Ronald, or some name like that. Wilmington\nseems the name of the church spire that I see beyond.'\n(3) Ralph Nevile, two centuries ago or more. Apparently this R.N.,\n'a scholar not a soldier,' died immediately after dining with\nthe king, and was buried with no inscription upon his tomb.\n\f148 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1903.\n(4) Dover or Dovercourt. 'There is a woman there. Emmie is the\nname. I want a message given to Emmie and the boy Frank.\nIt is from Harry on the sea to-night. Tell her from me, Harry\nthinks of her.'\n(5) 'Nesta and Trenerry, this is a new point\u2014not known to you.\nThe message will be understood by others.'\n(In same script as above:)\n'Great Crosby is a name that was wanted\u2014and Marston, Everard\nMarston I think. Some one will help you with that name.'\n(6) 'Maupertuis and Sarrasin, these are names in a book together,\na yellow book with clear good print early printed\u2014some one has\njust read it in a library.'\n(7) Romenzana ; and perhaps connected with it Clemens.\n(8) 'Ask at Smithfield for the name\u2014You do not know. Portals\nor Portalis.'\n(9) A cross with a green wreath upon it ; 'In honour A. J. C. in\nripis Douern.'\n'Crosik or Croisic ought to help you to the cross and wreath.'\nAny reader who has any suggestion to make as to the identity\nof these names is requested to write to Mrs. Verrall, 5 Selwyn\nGardens, Cambridge.\nNOTE ON THE BEVERLEY FARMHOUSE CASE.\nREPORTS have appeared in several newspapers during the last\nfew months as to occurrences at Kaikes Farm, Beverley, York\nshire, where, it was said, loaves of bread were constantly\ndiminishing in a mysterious manner.\nWe have for some time been engaged in enquiries into this\ncase, which we find is probably to be explained by ordinary\ncauses, and we propose to print the particulars in the Journal\nas soon as our information is complete.\n\fNOTICES.\nCOUNCIL MEETING.\nThe next MEETING of the COUNCIL will be held at 20 HANOVER SQUARE,\nLondon, W., on MONDAY, December 7th, 1903, at 2.45 p.m.\nPRIVATE MEETING FOR MEMBERS AND ASSOCIATES.\nA Private Meeting for Members and Associates only will be held in the\nHall at 20 Hanover Square, London, W., on Monday, December 7th, 1903,\nat 4.15 p.m., when a paper on\n\" TYPES OF PHENOMENA EXHIBITED is MRS.

MILNE BRAMWELL, M.B., C.M.\n800. 478 pages. 18.s. net.\nThe chief aim of this monograph is to draw the attention of medical men\nto- the therapeutic value of Hypnotism. The author gives the results of\ntwelve years of his own practice and research, with personal observations\nof the work done in France, Germany, Sweden, Holland, Switzerland, and\nBelgium.\nThe historical part of the book is specially devoted to the comparatively\nlittle known work of the English pioneers, Elliotson, Esdaile, and Braid,\nwhile the final chapter of references contains much information which has\nnot hitherto been published in accessible form.\nThe methods of inducing Hypnotism are exhaustively dealt with and\ninstructions given in regard to the management of the hypnotic state, with\ndetails as to the causes of susceptibility to hypnosis. Hypnotic theories are\ndescribed and discussed, and special prominence is given to Mr. Myers's\ntheory of the subliminal consciousness and the light thrown by it on the\nproblems of hypnotism.\nGRANT RICHARDS, 48 LEICESTER SQUARE, LONDON, W.C.\n\fTHE JOURNAL.\nThe JOURNAL can be obtained, bound in cloth, as under, by Members and\nAssociates :\u2014\nVol. V.

The following\nmemoranda, though not an abstract of the present, paper, give\nin a compendious form the general conclusions arrived at by\nProfessor Barrett :\nThe investigations on which I have been engaged for several\nyears past have led me to the following conclusions, the evidence\nfor which is contained in the papers I have already published,\nand in the paper to be read to-day :\n1. A certain number of persons\u2014say, one or two in every\nscore\u2014have a marked idiosyncrasy, which manifests itself in\nslight involuntary and unconscious muscular movements, usually\nof the arms and hands. Doubtless all persons exhibit this to\na less degree.\n2. These movements may be cultivated by repetition, by\nexpectant attention, and by inhibiting the conscious and voluntary\ncontrol of those particular muscles.\n3. They are best revealed (\u00ab) by the oscillations of the so-\ncalled pendulc-explorateur, a ring or ball suspended from a thread\nheld between the thumb and finger ; and (b) by the motion of\n\fDKC., 1903. General Meeting. 153\nthe so-called tlivininy or dowsing-rod, usually but not always\na forked twig, the branching ends being held one in each hand,\nso that the whole is in somewhat unstable equilibrium.\n4. These instruments, along with other less portable devices,\nsuch as planchette, may be called autoscopes, as they reveal minute\nautomatic movements of the muscles.\n5. Motor automatism, as this phenomenon is termed, is a reflex\naction excited by some stimulus, derived either (i.) from a\ndormant idea, or a sub-conscious suggestion, in the automatist's\nown mind ; or (ii.) from a sub-conscious impression produced on\nthe automatist by an external object, or by an external mind.\nThe former create auto-suggestive, or auto-genous movements of\nthe autoscope ; the latter are hetero-siu\/gestive movements.\n6. Abundant evidence has been obtained, showing that the\nsudden twisting of the dowsing rod may arise from both (i.) and\n(ii.) Hence to infer, a priori, that the motion of the rod is due\nto a particular stimulus, arising from the presence of underground\nwater, is absurd. Albeit this false inference is usually drawn by\nprofessional dowsers, who thus sometimes lead the credulous into\nvery costly mistakes.\n7. Underground water and metallic ores are often indicated\nby surface signs, imperceptible to the ordinary observer, but\nwhich become known to the experienced dowser. Such indica\ntions, even when not consciously perceived, may create a sub\nconscious impression on the dowser that will excite the automatic\nmotion of his rod (see 5, ii.). A plausible explanation of the\nsuccess achieved by some dowsers may thus be given.\n8. But there are numerous cases where this explanation\ncompletely breaks down, and yet the dowser, often an un\nobservant, ignorant man, has succeeded where the most skilful\nobservers have failed. Mere chance coincidence,\u2014lucky hits,\u2014\ncan also be shown to be wholly inadequate to account for these\nsuccesses.\n9. Xor can we explain them by some electrical or other\nknown physical agency, or radio-active emanation, proceeding\nfrom underground water or ores and detected by the dowser.\nFor dowsers are not peculiarly sensitive to such influences, and,\nmoreover, they have been successful in many other objects of\nsearch besides water and ores. The true explanation is probably\n\f154 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DBC., 1903.\nto be found in something new to science, which may be stated\nas follows :\n10. Amongst those who exhibit motor-automatism, a certain\nproportion have a sub-conscious, supernormal perceptive faculty.\nAny particular object sought for\u2014it seems immaterial what that\nobject may be\u2014excites an impression on the automatist when\nhe approaches it, though the object is usually out of sight, and\nmay be far beneath the surface of the ground.\n11. This impression in most cases remains entirely sub\nconscious, and is only revealed by its exciting the reflex that\nmoves the dowsing rod, or other portable autoscope ; not in\nfrequently, however, it reaches the level of an obscure sensation\nor emotional disturbance, and in some cases it actually rises to\nu conscious perception of the object sought for. In these latter\ncases motor automatism may be absent.\n12. A good dowser is, therefore, one who possesses this\nsupernormal perceptive power and instinctively allows it to be\noperative when dowsing. Like other instinctive acts arising from\nsome unexplained perceptive faculty\u2014such as the \" homing \" of\npigeons and of certain animals\u2014the intrusion of reason or of\nany conscious volition on the part of the dowser is prejudicial\nor fatal to the end in view.\n13. Hence for 250 years it has been noticed that children,\nor simple country folk\u2014children of Nature\u2014whose minds are\nfree from preconceived ideas or reasoning, form the best dowsers,\nbeing less liable to auto-suggestion.\n14. When the normal self-consciousness is more or less in\nabeyance, or when it is completely submerged, as in the\nhypnotic state, we should expect to find this supernormal\nperceptive power more apparent.\n15. Inasmuch as something akin to an emotional disturbance\n(see 11) is excited in the percipient by the discovery of the\nobject of his search, we should expect to find corresponding\nchanges in the circulation of his blood or in its arterial pressure.\nModern sensitive methods of detecting and registering these\nchanges might thus supersede the dowsing rod, and would in\nany case form an interesting investigation for experimental\npsychologists.\nAt the conclusion of the paper a discussion followed.\n\fDEC., 1903. General Meeting. 155\nLORD FARRER said that he had attended ou this occasion to\nlisten and not to speak, but that at the request of the Chairman\nhe would say a few words upon his own experience of dowsing.\nHe had been led to the study of the subject by an experiment\nhe had made with an old man in Sussex, who had taken to\ndowsing, and although his own attitude had originally been one\nof \" philosophic doubt,\" the results of that experiment had cer\ntainly been very curious. He had also experimented with the\nDivining Rod himself, and had found, much to his horror at\nthe moment, that it moved in his own hands. He was not\nquite convinced, however, that some physical cause might not\nultimately be found to account for the faculty. The best dowsers\nthat he had come across did not use rods, but divined through\nsensations in their hands, and he thought this might well be a\nsubject for experiment by physiologists. Every one who had\ntravelled in uncivilised parts of the world was aware that horses,\nwhen far from water, often possessed the power of tracking it.\nMight not this power, in fact, be due to a lost sense\u2014a sense\nthat had perhaps been common when its possession was more\nnecessary than at present, and which might have been lost\nthrough disuse ? Another interesting point to note was with\nregard to the sort of water found, which was not merely under\nground ivater, but an underground stream ; it appeared that it\nmust be moving water, and it was conceivable that the motion\nmight have some obscure effect on the human body.\nMR. ANDHKW LANG said that personally he found the theory\nof unconscious muscular action an unsatisfactory explanation of\nthe phenomena of dowsing, and certainly it was not a voluntary\naction on the dowser's part that moved his rod. He had himself\nexperimented with a dowsing rod, and found that it moved in\nhis hands, entirely against his own will. He was, of course,\nperfectly conscious of what he was doing, and did not for a\nmoment suppose that the stick was being pushed about by a\nspirit. It was difficult to make those for whom the rod would\nnot work realise the feeling it produced. The power of find\ning water might, as Lord Farrer observed, be a primitive sense,\nbut the Australian blacks, many of whom inhabited almost water\nless regions, did not, as far as was known, use divining rods,\nthough they could generally find whatever water existed\u2014pro\nbably as the result of long experience in searching for it.\n\f156 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1903.\nDR. WYLD quoted a case of the failure of the water supply in\na large shooting in Buckinghamshire. The family had eventually\nbeen compelled to try a dowser, who came down from Yorkshire,\nand whom he (Dr. Wyld) had accompanied and observed closely\nwhilst he walked about the place. He carried the usual rod,\nwhich he held by the two arms of the Y, and pointed with it\nin front of him. At one point the tip of the rod bent at right\nangles to the stem, so energetically that the rod broke. He was\npractically certain that this had not been done by the man's\nown muscular action.\nMR. H. A. SMITH inquired how the breaking of the rod, which\nundoubtedly takes place in some cases, could be accounted for\nby unconscious muscular action.\nMR. M. CRACKANTIIORPE asked whether it would not be\npossible to invent some kind of electrical apparatus which\nwould be sensitive to underground streams.\nMR. W. W. BAGGALLY asked whether it was likely that there\nwas any analogy between the action of the divining rod in rela\ntion to underground water and an electrical apparatus which\nhas lately been invented for discovering minerals underground.\nMR. F. 0. CONSTABLE proposed experimenting by means of an\nunderground pipe, through which water could be made to flow\nor not at will.\nSIR WILLIAM CROOKES said, in reply to Mr. Crackanthorpe's\nquestion, that he had for many years been trying to find some\nphysical method of testing or measuring supernormal suscepti\nbilities or capacities, but that so far he had entirely failed.\nPROFESSOR BARRETT, replying to the various questions that\nhad been raised, said that the breaking of the rod which some\ntimes occurred was probably due to one end being automatically\ntwisted by the dowser with one hand, whilst the other end was\nheld firmly in the other hand. With regard to the recently\ninvented apparatus for discovering underground metallic lodes by\ntheir electrical conductivity, he believed that this had been used\nsuccessfully in some cases ; with underground water the con\nditions were different. Nevertheless, he had suggested that\nmethod some years ago in a published paper as a method worth\ntrying. Experiments with underground water pipes had been\ntried many times by different experimenters, as was recorded\nin his own reports ; the dowser sometimes succeeded and some\n\fDEC., 1903. General Meeting. 157\ntimes failed in discovering whether any water was flowing through\nthe pipe or not ; but when he succeeded, it might conceivably be\nexplained by telepathy from the person who was managing the\nintermittent flow. In the cases the speaker had cited in this and\npreceding papers telepathy was, of course, excluded by the very\nnature of the experiments, since no one knew whether water was\npresent or not, otherwise a dowser would not have been called in,\nand it was this feature that made them at once so interesting\nand so important. He had also, he said, tested dowsers in\norder to ascertain whether they were specially sensitive to\nelectric influence or to the various sources of radio-activity, such\nas the emanations from radium salts, etc., but had failed to dis\ncover any susceptibilities of this kind. Further, he was con\nvinced that no known perceptive power could explain this\nalleged dowsing faculty ; hence the conclusion at which he had\narrived. Much more experimental evidence would, however, be\nrequired before the explanation he had ventured to suggest would\nbe generally accepted by science.\nCASE.\nL. ll.\u00b0>4. Crystal vision.\nTHE following case was kindly obtained for us by an Associate\nof the Society, the Kev. A. H. E. Lee, of 3 Cambrian Terrace,\nHolbeck Moor, Leeds. The full names and addresses of the\nwitnesses were given to us, with a request not to print them.\nIt will be seen that the experience was of the nature of a\ncrystal vision, though the vision was seen in a glass of water.\nThe percipient, Mrs. H., writes :\nLEEDS, May 26th, 1902.\nOn the night of April 16th I retired to bed feeling unusually\ndepressed, placing a glass of water on the table for drinking during\nthe night. My husband was on night duty at the time on the\nL.N.W. line. I awoke with a start about three o'clock in the\nmorning, and feeling thirsty, reached out of bed for the water ;\nwhen about to partake of it, I saw, to my surprise, a moving\npicture in the glass, comprising waggons, and in the rear a guard\nvan ; as I looked they all appeared to smash into each other, and\nI noticed the van in particular was the most damaged. My husband\n\f158 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1903.\ncame home about two hours later and told me that he passed the\nscene of the accident, and that the guard was seriously injured. I\nregard the above as something more than a mere coincidence.\nMr. H. writes :\nI am a Goods Inspector on the L.N.W. Railway, and was\ntravelling with a goods train to Manchester on the night of April\n16th, 1902, and, after passing Ashton at 3.10 a.m. on the 17th, I\npassed the scene of an accident, which had occurred to our Leeds\nto London express goods train on the Micklehurst New Line, near\nStaley and Millbrook Station. It was distinctly visible to me and\nthe goods guard I was travelling with, as the breakdown gang\nwas out and large fires burning. On my returning from Man\nchester, I passed over the scene of the accident, and saw the\nwaggons and guard's van, the latter being very badly damaged ;\nthat was about 7.50 a.m. April Nth. On my reaching home, my\nwife told me of the vision she had seen.\nThe following are questions addressed by Mr. Lee to\nMrs. H., with her answers appended, received by us on June\n30th, 1902:\n(1) Why were you depressed ? Did you connect your depression\nwith your husband 1\nsins. I was depressed on account of the child's illness, and\nworried owing to my husband's absence from home at such a time ;\nupon seeing the vision, I at once thought of my husband and\nwondered if he was safe.\n(2) Did you see the time, or how did you know ?\nAns. At that time I lifted the clock off the mantel and placed\nit on the table, where I could see it without rising.\n(3) Do you generally have water at your side ?\nAns. Every night, as the little girl generally asks for water\nduring the night.\n(4) Was the room lighted, or how did you see the picture 1\nAns. The gas was left burning, turned low, and there was a\nbright fire, as owing to the sickness it was always kept in.\n(5) Did the whole train seem to smash up ?\nAns. When I saw the picture, there appeared to be a few\nwaggons and a guard's van ; they all seemed to smash into each\nother.\n(6) What time did your husband come home 1\nAns. About nine o'clock in the morning.\n\fDEC., 1903. Case. 159\n(7) Had you connected the vision with him, and felt anxious on\nthat account 1\nAns. Yes.\n(8) Did he tell you first, or you him t\nAiis. I told him first, and to my surprise he knew of the\naccident.\n(9) Do you often have similar experiences and warnings 1\nAns. Very often, especially before sickness.\n(10) Have you ever heard of crystal-gazing?\nAns. Yes, but I have never looked through one.\nIn answer to further questions from us, Mr. H. wrote on\nAugust IHth, 1902 :\nIn answer to your letter of 16th ulto., I have been unavoidably\nbusy or would have replied sooner.\n(1) I was about a quarter of a mile from the scene of the\naccident when I passed at 3 a.m., and saw the men working on\nthe line, there being great fires burning and numerous lanterns,\nbut could not distinguish anything else distinctly.\n(2) The accident occurred at about 10 p.m.\n(3) I passed the scene a second time at 7.50 the next morning,\nand saw the break van and one or two waggons whioh had been\nin the collision, and all very much broken up.\nThus it appears that at the time when Mrs. H. saw the\nvision, her husband had only seen that there was an accident,\nthe details of which were indistinguishable to him, and it was\nnot until about five hours later that he actually witnessed\nthe details, which corresponded fairly closely to Mrs. H.'s\nvision. His connection with railway affairs would be likely\nto make his recollection of the times especially accurate ;\nso that at first sight there might seem to be some difficulty\nin explaining the case by telepathy from him to his wife.\nWe have to consider, however, that t>he mere knowledge that\nan accident had taken place would inevitably call up in the\nmind\u2014especially of a railway man\u2014some impression of the\ndetails of the scene, which would be more or less in\naccordance with the facts ; and it is not clear that Mrs. H.'s\nvision accorded with them more closely than would such an\nimpression. Thus the details of her vision might well have\nbeen derived from the impression produced in his mind on\nfirst passing the scene.\n\f160 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1903.\nUNPREJUDICED TESTIMONY.\nA CORRESPONDENT has sent us the following example of wide\ndivergences in the evidence of two eye-witnesses of the same\nevent\u2014an event in which they were apparently only interested\nas spectators, having no theory to support about it.\nThe accounts are taken from the Daily Chronicle of Novem\nber fith, 190o, and relate to the recent murders of Armenians\nat Peckham, Account (A) is as follows :\n(1) Yesterday ... a party of eight Huntschakisti ventured out\nof doors from their headquarters practically for the first time since\ntheir comrade was slain at Nunhead-grove. . . . The assassin, after\nreturning from his preliminary tour of inspection, loitered about on the\nfootpath for some time. Then he disappeared only, as it was after\nwards shown, to take shelter in the open right-of-way of No. 45,\nwhere he was tolerably safe from observation. About the time the\nassassin took up his station, the eight members of the Huntchakisti\nparty had started on their homeward journey. The narrow dimen\nsions of the footpath did not permit of their walking abreast, so\nthey split up into three groups. In the foremost group were two\ndelegates from Russia. They were nearly forty yards in advance of\nthe second group, which consisted of Aram Grigorian, aged twenty-\nfive, Tigran Izmirian, thirty-two, and a third Huntschakist named\nKarapitian. The remainder of the party sauntered slowly along\nsome hundred yards in the rear of the second group. It was the\nmembers of this second group that were attacked by the hiding\nassassin. Grigorian was walking on the side nearest the right-of-\nway, and as far as can at present be ascertained, Karapitian was in\nthe middle, while Izmirian was nearest the gutter. The first group\npassed the murderer's hiding place safely. Why the assassin did not\nfire upon them is not quite clear, unless it be that it was the mem\nbers of the second group and none other he wished to assassinate.\n(2) As Grigorian and his comrades passed the right-of-way which\ngives access to No. 43, the murderer took a couple of steps forward,\nwhich brought him from the shelter of the fence on to the footway.\nHis victims were then some six paces in front of him. They were\nwalking abreast, and had not observed the murderer's stealthy\nspring.\n(3) Suddenly, producing a bright, new-looking nickel-plated six-\nchambered revolver from his pocket, he levelled the weapon and fired\npoint blank at Grigorian, who was nearest to him.\n\fDRC., 1903. Unprejudiced Testimony. 1CI\n(4) There was a sharp crack as the pistol went ofl', and next\nmoment, the first victim, who had both hands thrust deep in his\ncoat pockets, pitched forward upon his face, where he lay lifeless\nwith a bullet through his brain.\n(5) The murderer's shooting was extremely rapid. Almost before\nthe dead man's companions had recovered from their surprise he\nhad fired two shots at Karapitian, who was walking in the middle.\nBoth shots missed, singularly enough. Karapitian, who was unarmed\nand unable to meet the assassin on equal terms, sprang away and\nsucceeded in escaping.\n(6) The luckless Izmirian was not so fortunate. Upon him tilt-\nmurderer now turned the still smoking weapon. He fired but one\nshot at him. This took effect in the back of the head, about\nthe base of the skull, and proved instantly fatal. In falling.\nIzmirian turned half round and lay beside his dead comrade, the\nfeet of both men facing the gutter. When the murderer had finished\nhis last victim he turned and attempted to escape.\n(7) The first group of delegates hearing the shooting, turned round\nand witnessed the murder of their comrades. For a moment they\nwere spellbound with horror. Then one of their number named\nTaslurian rushed back, hoping to grapple with the assassin. With\nhim went M. Karapitian, who luckily escaped the assassin's bullets\nwhen he opened fire in the first instance. But before the two men\ncould reach the scene of the tragedy the murderer had turned and\nwas fleeing for his life. But his flight was speedily cut short and\nhis life brought to an abrupt termination by his own hand. The\ntragedy was witnessed by at least half-a-dozen persons, exclusive of\nthe Armenians themselves.\n(8) One of the spectators acted with commendable promptitude.\nThis was a young man named John Jarvis, who happened to be in\nthe yard of No. 43 Peckham-rye, and within a few yards of the\nfence where the murderer had been in hiding. Jarvis jumped over\nthe fence of No. 43 on to the footpath when he heard the sounds\nof the shooting.\n(9) Yet so quick had the assassin acted that the two men were\nalready dead, and the murderer was fleeing when Jarvis reached the\nscene. Jarvis made a rush at him, and both cannoned. The\nimpact was disastrous to the assassin, for it brought him to the\nground.\n(10) Jarvis sprang upon him, grasping the revolver which he still\ngripped in his right hand. He had no sooner gained possession of\n\f162 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., luos.\nthe weapon than the murderer, who by this time had assumed a\nsitting position, slipped his left hand into his left side trousers\npocket and produced a second, and practically similar weapon.\n(11) In less time than it takes to relate, he had placed the muzzle\nof the weapon close behind his right ear and had blown out his\nbrains.\n(12) A police constable who arrived upon the scene at this junc\nture took the revolver from the hands of the murderer. It was\nfound to be a six-chambered weapon, nickel-plated, and was loaded\nin five chambers. . ,\nACCOUNT B.\nStory of an Eye-Witness.\nAn eye-witness of the tragedy, who was standing close to the\nmurdered men when they were attacked, has given a vivid descrip\ntion of the scene to one of our representatives :\n(I)1 I was standing on the Triangle about twenty minutes past\nthree (he said), when three men came along, and my mate said,\n\"Look! there are three of these foreigners.\" I said, \"Yes; I know\nthem ; I saw them at the inquest on Sagouni.\" My mate went\naway, and the three foreigners came strolling slowly along, walking\nin the direction of their club at 85 Peckham-rye. They got in front\nof me, and, as I was curious about them, I followed close behind.\nI noticed that they were looking anxiously about them, peering into\nomnibuses and cabs, as if they were watching for some one.\n(2) I kept about half-a-dozen yards behind them, and just as they\ncrossed Phillip Road a man jostled me, accidentally I think, and as\nif he had stumbled on the kerb.\n(3) I said something about being more careful, but he took no\nnotice, and just at that moment I saw him draw a revolver. He\nshot the middle man of the three behind the ear.\n(4) The wounded man fell in a heap on the roadway, and his two\ncompanions wheeled round and faced the assailant.\n(5) The assassin let his revolver go at another of the men, the\none nearest him, but missed him, (6) and I then quite clearly saw\nhim put his hand into one of his pockets and draw out a second\nrevolver, which he discharged at the third man. This man also fell\nin a heap, and the murderer at once made as if to go up Phillip\nRoad, but mistook the turning and ran into Sam Earl's yard. Any\none who did not know the neighbourhood well would mistake that\n\fDEC., 1903. Unprejudiced Testimony. 163\nfor a thoroughfare, as the houses at the end of it are about fifty\nyards from the entrance.\n(9) As the murderer turned into the yard he stumbled and fell,\nand, while lying on the ground, (10) he fired a second shot at the\nman whom he had already missed.\n(11) Again he missed him, and then, seeing a lot of people running\ntowards him, he raised his revolver and shot himself as he lay on\nthe ground.\n(12) The man who had been fired at twice and missed came up\nat that moment, and took the murderer's revolver out of his hand.\nThese accounts have been divided into numbered items for\nconvenience of comparison. It may be noticed that :\n(1) Account (A) mentions eight Huntschakisti ; (B) gives\nonly three, having apparently failed to notice the first and last\ngroup. This, however, is hardly an actual discrepancy, but\nseems to be simply an omission\u2014a failure of observation.\n(2) Account (A) describes the assassin as emerging from the\ninner side of the pathway. In (B) he seems to come from the\nouter side, as he appeared to the witness to stumble on the kerb.\n(3) Account (A) says he shot the man who was nearest to\nhim of the three ; (B) says he shot the middle man of the three.\n(4) Account (B) says the two others then wheeled round\nand faced him. (A) is not quite explicit on this point, but\nfrom the description in (5) of Karapitian running away, and\nin (6) of Izmirian half turning round as he fell after being\nshot, it appears that neither of the two turned round to face\nthe murderer.\n(5) Account (A) states that the second man who was shot\nat was the middle one ; two shots were tired ; (B) describes one\nshot at the nearest man.\n(6) Account (A) states that the next shot, made with the\nsame revolver, was fired at the third man, Izmirian, proving\ninstantly fatal ; (B) says, \" I quite clearly saw him put his\nhand into one of his pockets and draw out a second revolver,\nwhich he discharged at the third man,\" and then describes his\nrunning away.\n(7) Account (A) says that the first group of Huntschakisti\nhearing the shooting, turned round, and one of them, with the\nthird man Karapitian, who had escaped the bullets, ran back\nto secure the assassin. This is entirely omitted in 13.\n\f164 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1903.\n(8) Account (A) gives the exploit of John Jarvis, who also\nattempted to catch the murderer. This too is omitted in B.\n(9) Account (A) states that Jarvis, rushing at the murderer,\nbrought him to the ground; (B) says that as he turned into\nthe yard, he stumbled and fell.\n(10) Account (A) says that Jarvis took away his first re\nvolver, and he then, sitting on the ground, produced a second\nrevolver from his pocket. This second revolver is stated in\n(B) to have been brought out at an earlier stage (see B. 6.),\nand to have been used in firing at Karapitian. Account (B)\nalso says that at this point he fired a second shot at Karapitiau.\n(11) Account (A) says that on taking the second revolver\nout of his pocket, he immediately turned it on himself. (B)\nsays that this was only done after missing Karapitiau a second\ntime, and describes the pursuit of the murderer as only be\nginning just before he shot himself.\n(12) Account (A) says that a police constable who arrived\nimmediately after the suicide, took the revolver from the hands\nof the murderer ; (B) says that Karapitian came up at this\nmoment and took the revolver from him.\nOne or other of these accounts then, if not both, must be\ngrossly inaccurate in detail ; yet both were apparently given\nby eye-witnesses, and certainly within a few hours of the\nevent, and probably in all good faith.\nA very frequent complaint alleged against our Society is that\nreports of such occurrences as spiritualistic seances are treated\nwith undue scepticism ; but a study of reports of events of\nalmost any kind will show how ditticult it is to give accurate\ndescriptions, and consequently how necessary it is to exercise\ncaution in regard to them. In the present case, the occur\nrence took place in broad daylight : the spectators had not\nhad their senses confused and their imaginations stimulated\nby a long wait in darkness ; there was nothing that\nthey were especially expecting or desiring to see, and no one to\nsuggest to them what was happening or likely to happen. We\ndo not perhaps often find such striking discrepancies in\nreports of seances ; but in considering how far the witnesses\nagree in the latter case, it is important to observe whether or\nnot they have compared notes before reporting, and so brought\ninto agreement recollections which were at first discordant.\n\fNOTICES.\nCOUNCIL MEETING.\nThe next MEETING of the COUNCIL will be held at 20 HANOVER\nLondon, W., on MONDAY, December 7th, 1903, at 2.45 p.m.\nPRIVATE MEETING FOR MEMBERS AND ASSOCIATES.\nA Private Meeting for Members and Associates only will be held in the\nHall at 20 Hanover Square, London, W., on Monday, December 7th, 1903,\nat 4.15 p.m., when a paper on\n\" TYPES OF PHENOMENA EXHIBITED IN MRS.

MILNE BRAMWELL, M.B., C.M.\n8\u00abo. 478 par\/in. IS*, net.\nThe chief aim of this monograph is to draw the attention of medical men\nto the therapeutic value of Hypnotism. The author gives the results of\ntwelve years of his own practice and research, with personal observations\n(pf the work done in France, Germany, Sweden, Holland, Switzerland, and\nBelgium.\nThe historical part of the book is specially devoted to the comparatively\nlittle known work of the English pioneers, Elliotaon, Esdaile, and Braid,\nwhile the final chapter of references contains much information which has\nnot hitherto been published in accessible form.\nThe methods of inducing Hypnotism are exhaustively dealt with and\ninstructions given in regard to the management of the hypnotic state, with\ndetails as to the causes of susceptibility to hypnosis. Hypnotic theories are\ndescribed and discussed, and special prominence is given to Mr. Myers's\ntheory of the subliminal consciousness and the light thrown by it on the\nproblems of hypnotism.\nGRANT RICHARDS, 48 LEICEHTKR SQUARE, LONDON, W.C.\n\fTHE JOURNAL.\nThe JOURNAL can be obtained, bound in cloth, as under, by Members and\nAssociates :\u2014\nVol. V.

Meeting of the Council. 1(>7\nMEETING OF THE COUNCIL\nTHE 63rd Meeting of the Council was held at 20 Hanover\nSquare, W., on Monday, December 7th, 1903, at 2.45 P.M.; the\nPresident in the Chair. There were also present : Mr. W. W.\nBaggally, the Hon. E. Feilding, Mr. F. N. Hales, Mr. J. G.\nPiddington, Mr. St. G. L. Fox Pitt, Mr. F. Podmore, Mrs.\nSidgwick, Mr. H. Arthur Smith, Lieut.-Colonel Le M. Taylor,\nDr. C. Lloyd Tuckey, Mrs. Verrall, and Miss Alice Johnson,\nSecretary.\nThe minutes of the two previous meetings were read and\nsigned as correct.\nThree new Members and thirteen new Associates were elected.\nThe election of four new Associates of the American Branch\nwas recorded. The names and addresses are given above.\nThe monthly account for November was presented and read.\nThe Hon. Everard Feilding was elected Co.-Honorary Sec\nretary.\nIt was agreed that the Annual General Meeting of\nMembers of the Society should be held on January 29th,\n1904, at 4.30 P.M., immediately before the Council meeting\non the same day, and that the next General Meeting of the\nSociety should be held on the evening of the same day,\nat 8.30.\nPRIVATE MEETING FOR MEMBERS AND ASSOCIATES.\nTHE sixth of the series of Private Meetings for Members and\nAssociates only was held in the Large Hall at 20 Hanover\nSquare, London, W., on Monday, December 7th, 1903, at\n4.15 P.M.; the President, Sir Oliver Lodge, in the chair.\nMR. J. G. PIDDINGTON read some extracts from his paper\non \" The Types of Phenomena displayed in Mrs. Thompson's\nTrance,\" which will appear immediately in the Proceedings,\nand is therefore not summarised here.\nTHE PRESIDENT remarked that one of the most interesting\ntypes of phenomena was the occasional coincidences between\nthe trance experiences of Mrs. Thompson and those of other\nmediums at a distance from her, e.g. when \" Nelly \" (Mrs.\nThompson's control) said she had visited \" Miss Rawson \" (who\nwas then in the South of France) on the day on which Mr.\n\f1 68 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1904.\nMyers had recorded that \" Miss Eawson \" had been possessed\nby a soi-disant Mrs. Thompson.\nMR. THURSTAN said that he was acquainted with many\ninstances of predictions made by Mrs. Thompson which had\nbeen fulfilled.\nMR. THOMPSON said that \" Nelly \" had made a good many\npredictions relating to trivial matters, some of which had been\nfulfilled, and some not ; but as he had not kept complete\nrecords of all the predictions, he did not feel himself justified\nin proffering them as evidence, the more so as he was unable\nto state what proportion had been fulfilled.\nMR. Hu.ME-RoTHERY thought the suspicious side of trance\ncommunications deserved great attention. For instance, Pro\nfessor Hyslop's sittings with Mrs. Piper would have had much\nevidential value for personal identity but for two things.\nWhen the control professed to be quite clear, much non-\nevidential matter was given fluently ; but as soon as an attempt\nwas made to give evidential matter, hesitation ensued. This\nlatter would appear to need no more clearness of intellect\nthan the former, but did need a knowledge of the facts.\nAgain, many details were given as to a relation of Professor\nHyslop ; these were found to apply not to him but to a man of\nthe same name\u2014quite unrelated\u2014who had lived in the same\ncounty and whose name figured in a local history. These\npoints raised a strong presumption against the communications\ncoming from the sources alleged. The speaker knew of a case\nwhere, after various communicators had alleged their presence\nand evidential matter had been given, the sitter charged\nthe control with personation in consequence of a false answer.\nAfter a spirited defence, the charge being still persisted in,\nthe control stated that it had personated all the alleged\ncommunicators.\nTHE PRESIDENT said he quite agreed with the last speaker\nas to the necessity for caution in the treatment of all alleged\ncommunications, and the difficulty both of disentangling the\nevidential from the non-evidential matter, and of finding the\ntrue interpretation even of the evidential matter. It was\nthese difficulties which had so long stood in the way of any\nelucidation of the problems involved and which enforced on\nus still an attitude of suspended judgment. Had the subject\n\fJAN., 1904. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 169\nbeen an easy one, it would have been assimilated by the human\nrace long ago. In particular it was highly desirable that no\none should either be perturbed, or should act against his judg\nment, on account of predictions or any other class of communi\ncations received in this way.\nPROFESSOR SIMON NEWCOMB OX \" THE GEORGIA\nMAGNET.\"\nTHE following letter from Sir Oliver Lodge appeared in the\nLiterary Supplement of \"The Times\" of November 27th, 1903,\nunder the heading, \" The Late Mr. Myers and Credulity.\"\nTo THE EDITOR OF \"THE TIMES.\"\nSIR,\u2014I observe that the concluding portion of a book entitled\n\" Reminiscences of an Astronomer,\" by Professor Simon Newcomb,\nhas led many reviewers to draw the natural inference that the late\nF. W. H. Myers and the Society for Psychical Research were misled\ninto supposing that the ingenious mechanical tricks of a person called\nby her exploiters \" the little Georgia Magnet,\" some years ago were\nattributable to supernormal power; and that they are publishing\nthis inference as if it were true.\nWill you allow me, therefore, in justice to the memory of my\nfriend, to assert that it is simply false, and that the Society reported\nagainst anything but simple mechanics in that case from the first 1\nYours faithfully,\nOLIVER LODGE.\nTHE UNIVERSITY, BIRMINGHAM, Nov. 24.\nA full account of the performances of Mrs. Abbott, known\nas the \" Little Georgia Magnet,\" is to be found in Mr. Myers's\npaper on \" Resolute Credulity,\" in the Proceedings S.P.R., Vol.\nXL, pp. 219-225, published in 1895. Mrs. Abbott used to\ngive public exhibitions, showing feats of strength of a re\nmarkable and at first sight inexplicable kind. These had been\ndescribed in an article by Dr. Henri Goudard in the Jan.-\nFeb., 1895, number of the Annales des Sciences Psychiquts,\nand consisted of such feats as the following : \" The\noperator stands on one foot holding a billiard cue, while a\ntall, strong man is then asked to push her backwards by\nsteady pressure on the cue, and fails.\" \" She presents her\nelbows to a person standing behind her, and requests to be\n\f170 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1904.\nlifted by them. Sometimes she can thus be lifted, sometimes\nshe cannot,\" thus showing an apparent alteration in weight.\n\" The apparent difficulty of being lifted is transmitted to another\nperson.\" \" Five or six persons are sitting or sprawling on a\nchair, which the operator then momentarily raises or jerks for\nan instant from the floor.\" The mechanism of these and\nsimilar feats were explained by Sir Oliver Lodge in a state\nment which Mr. Myers quotes. Sir Oliver Lodge visited Mrs.\nAbbott's exhibition more than once, and also had a private\ninterview with her, and tried experiments with other people of\nsuitable size. He concluded that the feats were ingeniously\nchosen to suit a short person, and that Mrs. Abbott, though\nsmall and frail in appearance, was probably muscular, at any\nrate in the arms. He had previously given a similar and\nentirely normal explanation of the case at a meeting of the\nSociety held on December 4th, 1891, and reported in the\nJournal, Vol. V., pp. 167-169.\nIn his article, Mr. Myers quotes also (from the Rdii)io-\nPhilosophical Journal) an account of Mrs. Abbott's perform\nances by the Kev. Solon Laner, and refers to a report by Dr.\nHodgson and another by Professor J. H. Hyslop, who himself\nsucceeded in repeating almost all Mrs. Abbott's tricks.\nSir Oliver Lodge did not consider that there was anything\nin her performance of a deliberately fraudulent kind, but simply\nregarded it as an exhibition of well-chosen feats of strength\nand skill, with no more deception than a conjuror may legiti\nmately practise. It appears, however, that when Dr. Hodgson\nsaw her in Boston in 1889, the exhibition was, he thought,\nmore definitely spiritualistic, and therefore, under the circum\nstances, more definitely fraudulent than it became later,\u2014when\nshe trusted perhaps rather to the interpretations of inexpert\nobservers than to any explicit statements to produce the im\npression that her performances were in some way supernormal.\nThere is thus no possible excuse for suggesting that the\nSociety at any time took this view of her, and any person who\nis unacquainted with Mr. Myers's attitude towards fraudulent\nphenomena in general is recommended to read the article on\n\" Eesolute Credulity \" above referred to, as well as the references\nin his book to similar topics (see, e.g.. Human Personality, Vol.\nII., pp. 206 and 501-503).\n\fJAN., 1904. The \" Wasting Loaves\" at Raikes Farm. 171\nTHE \"WASTING LOAVES\" AT RAIKES FAKM,\nBEVERLEY.\n.DURING the past autumn accounts under the above, or a like,\nheading have appeared in several newspapers. Thus the Daily\nExpress for August 24th, 1903, says:\u2014\nMr. and Mrs. Webster of Raikes Farm have for three months\nbeen perturbed by a strange fate which has befallen their supply\nof bread. Morning after morning they came down to find the\nloaves they left in the bread-pan, some diminished in size, others\nwith crusts taken off, some more with holes through them, and yet\nno signs of crumbs or of mice or of human handling.\nOther accounts are given in the same paper for August 81st,\nand October 13th and 15th, 1903. The Miller for September\n7th, 1903, contains a report by ex-Police-constable R. Berridge,\nof Bishop Burton, who was employed by the Websters to stay\nin the house, and take sole charge of the dairy. This report,\ndated August 15th, 1903, is as follows:\u2014\nI, Richard Berridge, ex-Police-constable, residing at Bishop Burton,\ndo hereby state that on August 11, 1903, I was employed by Mr.\nWebster, of Kaikes Farm, to take charge of the dairy, with a view of\ntrying to find out who it was that was wasting bread, as the waste\nhas been going on since the first week in March. On the llth inst.\nI went to Raikes Farm, taking with me two loaves of bread which\nI bought at Beverley the previous night. I placed them in the\ndairy, and they appeared to keep all right, but I may say there\nwas some bread in another part of the house which was wasting\naway. On the 13th inst. I cut the top off one of the loaves which\nI had taken up with me, and to my surprise there was a hole\nthrough the centre of the loaf to the bottom, and the hole got\nlarger and larger. No. 2 loaf which I took with me wasted in\nthe dairy. On the 12th inst. I placed five new loaves of bread,\nwhich were baked in the house, in the dairy in a pancheon, and it\nappeared to keep all right till the following day. It was all right\nat 10 a.m., but when I examined it at 12 noon, to my surprise,\nthe top of one loaf the whole length had disappeared, and the other\nloaves were wasting, some more than others. Now I have had\nthis bread locked up with my own lock which I bought, and I have\nplaced bread in secret places in the house known only to myself,\nand still it wasted away, and, strange to say, although there is so\n\f172 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., i\u00bbo\u00bb.\nmuch bread wasted, there are no crumbs left in the pancheon. I\nam at a loss to know the reason of this bread wasting, but of one\nthing I am convinced, no human hands are doing it, and I must\nleave the mystery to be solved by an abler person than myself.\u2014\n(Signed) R. BERRIDGB.\nEaikes Farm is in the village of Bishop Burton on the York\nshire Wolds a little to the west of Beverley. Mr. Webster (who\nhas now left) was then the hind, or bailiff, who occupied and\nworked the farm under the tenant ; and his household consisted\nof himself, his wife, wife's mother, seven children, and ten farm\nhands. We asked Mr. E. Westlake to look into the matter,\nand he went to the Express office and saw their reporter, Mr.\nQuiim, who had just returned from the farm and who gave\nhim an account of the investigation which he had carried out\nwith the help of Mr. Pearman, the Vicar of Bishop Burton.\nMr. Westlake's notes of this account were subsequently sub\nmitted to Mr. Quinn, who writes, December 10th, 1903:\u2014\n\" Save in the .one or two instances in which I have made\ncorrections, your notes, so far as they go, are quite accurate.\"\nThe notes revised by Mr. Quinn are as follows :\u2014\n[Information received on October 20th, 1903, from Mr. D. J. Quinn,\nreporter, Daily Express Office, Tudor Street, E.G.].\nI went to Kaikes Farm during the week ending October 17th,\n1903. Mr. and Mrs. Webster gave me every information. One\nnight, Mr. Pearman, myself, and Mr. Webster sat up all night with\nthe bread, but nothing happened. In the morning the bread was\ntaken to the kitchen for breakfast, and a few minutes later Mrs.\nWebster came running out with a loaf, from the bottom of which\na piece had been torn off. We asked who had been in the kitchen,\nand Mr. and Mrs. Webster replied, only themselves and their\ndaughter (aged between 18 and 19), who aids in the housework.\nBread placed in a locked cupboard in the dining-room was un\ntouched. The door of the cupboard was then unlocked.\nDuring the afternoon, when I had gone out to the village, Mr.\nPearman said he was tired and would take a nap. tie looked at\nthe bread in the cupboard, which was all right. He went into the\nparlour, drew down the blind, lay down on a couch, and drew a\ncloak over his face, but did not go to sleep. The parlour door\nwas open, andi was opposite to the door of the dining room on the\nother side of the passage.\n\fJAN., 1904. The \" Wasting Loaves\" at Haikex Farm. 173\nMr. Peannan then heard Mrs. Webster come into the dining\nroom and walk round the table clearing away the things ; he could\nhear she did not go to the cupboard.\nAfterwards he heard the eldest daughter enter the dining room\nand go to the cupboard and place something in it (sounded like\nknives or spoons). She stayed there about a minute and a half.\nShe then left the room. Mr. Pearman at once got up and went to\nthe cupboard, and found that a piece had been torn off the loaf.\nWhen I returned, Mr. Pearman told me the above, and we thought,\nin view of the trouble the matter was causing to Mr. and Mrs.\nWebster, that we ought to represent to them that the circumstances\npointed to the possibility of their daughter being concerned in it.\nThey, however, repudiated this suggestion altogether, and said it was\nworse than the previous mystery.\nIn regard to the experiments made previous to my arrival, I\nfound that the larder is divided by a wooden partition and door\n(which could be locked) made of vertical bars or strips of wood. I\nfound I could thrust my hands between the bars to some distance\nabove the wrists, and that when a loaf was placed on a shelf near\nthe partition, I could hold it with one hand and tear off a piece\nwith the other. I drew the girl's attention to this, and asked her\nto try, but she declined, saying, \"Oh, sir, I should not like to!\"\nHer arms were thinner than mine. Bread placed on the shelves too\nfar from the partition to be reached in this way had not been\ntouched.\nThe girl was the first up in the morning, and Mr. Webster in the\nexperiments he had made had allowed her access to the bread equally\nwith himself, and she may very well have been the first to handle\nit. The Websters apparently never thought of suspecting her, and I\nthink that all the experiments where the bread had \" wasted \" have\nbeen vitiated by this circumstance.\nI had not heard of the experiment with the \"poisoned loaf,\"\nwhich was not touched when the others were, as described by Mr.\nWebster in the Express of August 24th, but he would no doubt\nhave told his daughter which it was.\nMr. Westlake adds :\u2014\nI questioned Mr. Quinn in regard to the loaf described by P.O.\nBerridge, where he says he cut the top off one of the loaves, and\nwas surprised to find a hole through the centre. Mr. Quinn said\nthat he did not think that this implied (as I thought it did) that\nthe hole had no external aperture ; and that probably the loaf was\n\f174 Journal of Society jjor Psychical Research. JAN., 1904.\nin the same condition as the one he had seen brought from the\nkitchen (described above) in which the hole originated from the\nbottom ; and that Berridge might have cut his loaf without noticing\nthat there was a hole in the bottom.\nMr. Quinn's description of the larder, which is the place\ndescribed as the dairy by Mr. Berridge, shows that the pre\ncautions taken by the latter to guard it were probably in\nadequate. We wrote to Mr. Berridge, asking whether he had\nwitnessed anything which he was sure could not have been\ndone by a member of the family, but no reply has been\nreceived.\nMr. Quinn's report of his observations was sent to the\nDaily Ejyrcss, but was not published by them.\nWe ought to add that Mr. Pearman has not explicitly\nadmitted the accuracy of Mr. Quinn's account, given above,\nwhich we sent to him asking for his corroboration. His\nletters, however, implied that he shared Mr. Quinn's general\nview of the case. In reply to a second letter, asking for a\nstatement of the facts, he wrote :\u2014\u2022\nBISHOP BURTON, BEVERLEY, YORKSHIRE, Dec. 8th, 1903.\nDEAR SIR,\nIf you will send for a Be.terky Guardian, published on\nSaturday last in Beverley, you will perhaps be satisfied that there\nis nothing of use to your Society in the Raikes mystery.\nThe farm is in this parish. The Websters have left ; but as a\nclergyman I refuse to tell you the facts, beyond assuring you the\nsupernatural has had nothing to do with the bread disappearing.\nYours faithfully, W. A. PEARMAN.\nWe find that the Beverley Guardian for December 5th,\n190:5, has the following:\u2014\nThis is the first occasion upon which a single word of the so-called\nmystery of the disappearing bread at Raikes Farm, Bishop Burton,\nhas appeared in our columns, while other newspapers, far and near,\nhave \" written it up \" over and over again. The reason for us having\nadopted this course is that we have known for some months that\nthe \" mystery \" was really no mystery at all, but that the cause of\nthe disappearance was known to the tenant of the farm (Mr. R. Fisher,\nof Leconfield) and others, and that it would end when a change of\nbailiffs came to be made. This is now fully borne out by the fact\nthat since the new bailiff, Mr. Walker, entered into occupation of\n\fJAN., 1904. The \" Wasting Loaves \" at Raikes Farm. 175\nthe premises a fortnight ago, no bread whatever has disappeared or\nbeen affected in any way.\nMr. Quinn writes, December 10th, 1903 :\u2014\nI am not surprised that Mr. Pearman should refuse to assist you.\nHe urged me to let the matter drop, and, without telling me of it,\nwent so far as to telegraph to the Editor to the same effect, assert\ning \"that the matter was too dangerous\" to risk its publication.\nThus it was that the solution of the \" mystery \" did not appear in\nthe Express, though the North Mail (Newcastle) published my account\njust as I wired it.\nThis account, which Mr. Westlake did not see till after he\nhad written out his notes of Mr. Quinn's statement to him on\nDecember 20th, appears as follows in the North Mail for\nOctober 17th, 1903:\u2014\nThe mystery of the dwindling bread of Raikes Farm, Beverley,\nentered upon a new phase yesterday. It had reached a point when,\nin the interests of a father and a mother driven to the verge of\ndistraction, a serious attempt should be made to elucidate it.\nA story had gained currency which promised to earn for Raikes\nFarm an honoured place in the history of the haunted homes of\nEngland. It was that of a starving beggar who, many years ago, was\nsaid to have been found dead in an adjoining wood after being refused\nassistance at the farm, who was now exacting from Webster a belated\nrevenge for the uncharitableness of a former occupant.\nIn these circumstances the North Mail representative, with the\nfull concurrence of the parties immediately concerned, undertook,\nwith the assistance of the Rev. W. Pearman, Vicar of Bishop\nBurton, to lay the ghost. Having procured a number of loaves in\nthe village, the Vicar and Webster spent Thursday night in a close\nwatch upon the bread, which, with two loaves of the Websters, five\nin all, was distributed in the dairy and adjoining rooms. Portions of\na fourth loaf were, unknown to the Websters, placed in the kitchen.\nWebster, with the hospitality characteristic of Yorkshiremen, in\nsisted upon keeping his guests company in their long vigil. Fatigued\nwith his hard day's work, however, he was induced to stretch him\nself on a sofa, where he slumbered fitfully. Only the rain without\nand the loud ticking of a trio of clocks within disturbed the mid\nnight calm.\nOne strained one's ears in vain for a note of music or a footfall\non the stairs or floor above, but the ghost did not walk.\n\f176 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1904.\nA careful inspection of the loaves at dawn showed them to have\nbeen untouched, not a crumb was missing.\n\" But they will go,\" persisted the Websters, \" watch them for a\nday or two.\" The watch was maintained more or less closely\nthroughout the day with results that left no doubt in the watchers'\nminds that the dwindling of the Websters' loaves for the past seven\nmonths was not the work of the starving beggar's ghost.\nAt 6.30 the first manifestation of wasting appeared in the kitchen\non the end of a loaf which a few minutes before had been handed\nto Mrs. Webster intact for use on the breakfast table.\nThe second and third manifestations appeared in the afternoon\u2014\none on a loaf purposely placed within arm's reach inside the railings\nof the dairy, the other on a loaf placed on a shelf of a cupboard in\nthe dining room, the doors of which were left unlocked.\nBread locked away beyond arm's reach remained intact. No one\nwas actually seen to touch the loaves, but there was a strong\nsuspicion that it was not Webster nor his wife. They acted most\nstraightforwardly and hospitably throughout, and it is perhaps to\ntheir credit as parents that they resented any suspicion being cast\nupon their daughter.\nThe daughter, a quiet girl of perhaps seventeen or eighteen years\nof age, is a hard worker, and her parents know of no reason,\nmentally or physically, why such strange behaviour should be\nattributed to her. As for the noises said to have been heard in\nthe house, it is not improbable that they, too, are capable of a\nrational explanation.\nThe tenant, Mr. Robert Fisher, a well-known breeder, wrote\nto Mr. Westlake in confidence his opinion of the matter on\nOct. 24th. In a subsequent letter he says :\u2014\nLKCONFIKLD, BEVERLEY, December 8th, 1903.\nSince the Websters left the farm there has been no more bread\nmystery; they have taken the ghosts, microbes, etc., with them.\nBread has been put in exactly the same place by the new people,\nand up to date nothing interferes with it (or no person). ... I still\nhold to my former opinion that in the first [instance] it was a case\nof hysteria, since the press and the public have made such a fuss\nabout it ; I think they (the Websters) had other motives, seeing that\nhundreds of people have visited the farm and given useful tips and\npaid fees to see the wonderful bread. . . .\nROBERT FISHER.\n\fJAN., 1904. Case. 177\nCASE\nL. L135. Dream.\nThe following case was sent to us by an Associate of the\nSociety, Mr. F. C. Constable, of Wick Court, near Bristol, on\nApril 2nd, 1903. The first letter was written to Mr.\nConstable's cook, Miss Julia Cox, by her sister, Mrs. Hope,\nas follows :\n49 MAYBRICK ROAD,\n[Postmark, \"BATH, 10 p.m., April 1.03.\"]\nMY DEAR SISTER,\u2014I am sending you the copy from the Bible\nwhich I hope will be all right. I hope you will not mind my not\ncoming down, but if this is not satisfactory let me know and I\nwill come and bring the Bible with me. I shall come down after\nEaster without fail if all is well. It was very strange, but I\ndreamt Monday night [apparently the night of March 30th] that\nyou came here and wanted the Bible, as you thought you would\ntake greater care of it than I. I had told Bob about my dream\nbefore I had your letter. . . . [Signed] F. HOPE.\nIn answer to Mr. Constable's request for corroboration,\nMr. Hope wrote to him :\n49 MAYBRICK ROAD, OLDFIKLD PARK.\n[Postmark, \"BATH,\"] April 6 [1903].\nDEAR SIR,\u2014In answer to your request with reference to my wife's\ndream, I hereby state that my wife had gone to the theatre with\na friend. On going to the front door I looked behind as I some\ntimes do, to see if there were any letters. I found one from my\nwife's sister, Julia. As we had received one from her only a day\nor two before, I thought something must be the matter, so I opened\nit and found it was a request from her for particulars of her birth\nentry in a family Bible. I hunted about and found it in a box of\nold books that had come from the old home. When my wife came\nin she saw the Bible, and said as soon as she got inside the door,\n\"What have you got that old Bible for? I was dreaming about it\nlast night. I dreamed that Julia wanted it to get her birth entry\nfrom it.\" I had not had even a chance to speak to her before she\ngot that out, nor had she seen the letter, because I had put it\nbehind the tea-box on the mantel-shelf where we usually put our\nletters after reading them.\n\f17H Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAV., 1904.\nI was so much struck with the remarkable coincidence that I told\nmy fellow-workmen about it in the morning.\n[Signed] R. H. HOPK.\nP.S.\u2014I forgot to say that Julia's letter got destroyed by accident.\nR. H. H.\nMr. Constable writes, enclosing this letter:\nWICK COURT, NEAR BRISTOL, 1th April, 1903.\n... I think (from what I hear, not what I know) that Mr.\nHope's statement is accurate, and his wife's not so accurate\u2014 if, as I\nthink, there is contradiction. But these letters show how utterly\nuntrustworthy human memory is in detail. But memory as to gen\neral truth I would suggest is trustworthy. For instance, in this\n<:ase something did occur which struck those concerned as exceptional.\nF. C. CONSTABLK.\nThe following statement was written by Mrs. Constable,\nfrom Miss Cox's dictation, and signed as correct by the latter :\nWICK COURT, NEAR BRISTOL.\nI went to Bath on a Saturday and returned on a Tuesday in\nMarch. I do not remember the exact day. I did not know then\nthat I should want the register of my birth, and did not talk about\nthe entry in the Bible at all.\nI have read what is stated here and it is quite true.\nJULIA Cox.\nMrs. Constable adds :\n10th April, 1903.\nFrom notes in my possession I know that Miss Cox (my cook)\nwent to Bath on Saturday, March 14th, and returned on the follow\ning Tuesday, March 17th, 1903.\nLOUISA CONSTABLE.\nMr. Constable writes, enclosing the above, and explaining\nthe circumstances further :\nApril 10th, 1903.\nJulia Cox invested through me some money in an annuity. I\nthought she had better get at once an acknowledgment from the\noffice that her birth was rightly declared and so, after her visit\nto Bath on the 14th March, told her to get a copy of the entry\nin the Bible.\n\fJAN., 1904. CW. 179\nMr. Constable writes later :\nApril ISlh, 1903.\nMrs. Hope is here to spend the day with Julia Cox. She has\njust now told me :\u2014\n\" I dreamt on the Monday night Julia came to me for the Bible.\nShe said she wanted a copy of her register. What amazed me\nwas she said she could take better care of the Bible than I could.\nOn Tuesday I went to the theatre and when I came back about\nhalf-past ten there was my husband and the Bible on the table. I\ntold him of my dream and he said he had a letter from Julia\nasking for her register. It was very funny. Oh, yes ! It seemed\njust a dream.\"\nHer statement that it was \"just a dream\" was in answer to\nmy question. I thought the impression might have been stronger\nthan an ordinary dream.\nTo a further question Mrs. Hope adds:\u2014\"I have had dreams\nbefore of little matters that have come true, but none so real as\nthat one.\"\nF. C. CONSTABI.K.\nAN UNFULFILLED VISION.\nPSYCHICAL researchers would be the last persons to deny the\noccurrence of veridical dreams and visions. The Journal of the\nSociety is frequently supplied with well-authenticated instances,\nand one is perhaps a little inclined to over-estimate the pro\nportion realisations bear to failures. The following case is\ntherefore of interest, and is typical of a great number of un\nfulfilled presentiments which are forgotten and unrecorded.\nMrs. G. is entirely devoted to her only son, and he recipro\ncates her affection. When the war broke out in South Africa,\nhe volunteered for service, and came in for a great deal of hard\nfighting and privation. Mrs. G-. was recovering from a severe\nillness, and, to spare her feelings, he pretended he was going\nto America, and enlisted under an assumed name. Mrs. G.\nwrote to me as an old friend of her son's on April 18th, 1900,\nand I give the following extract from her letter. She had\nheard nothing of her son for four months, except a hurried\nnote, purporting to be sent from New York, until a few days\nbefore she wrote to me\u2014April 13th\u2014when she learnt that\n\f180 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1004.\nhe was fighting in South Africa. So on the date of the vision\nshe supposed him to be in British Columbia.\n\"I dozed off for u few minutes on the 13th of March, in\nthe afternoon, and saw my son gliding rapidly towards me, an\nexpression of beautiful ideal youth, with brightest eye, all\nbeyond the brightness of this world, and clad in long black\ngarment, double-breasted, with something white floating behind\nhis head. The impact caused my -chair seemingly to topple\nover, and the shock awakened me.\"\nYoung Mr. G. returned safe and sound in 1901, and I asked\nhim if anything particular had occurred on March 13th. He\nassures me that nothing unusual took place, though he was\nsuffering from dysentery, and was one of the force which\noccupied Bloernfontein on that day. He tells me his mother\nhas had presentiments about him on former occasions, and that\nonce, at least, when an accident occurred to him at school,\nthe facts corresponded with the vision.\nI should add that some knowledge of our literature proved\nvery useful in this case, for it enabled me to comfort the poor\nlady by assuring her that the chances were in favour of the\nvision being only the outcome of illness and over-wrought\nnerves, though at the same time one was sympathetic and\ninterested.\nC.

MILNE BRAMWELL, M.B., C.M.\n8\u00bbo. 478 page*. ISx. net.\nThe chief aim of this monograph is to draw the attention of medical men\nto the therapeutic value of Hypnotism. The author gives the results of\ntwelve years of his own practice and research, with personal observations\nof the work done in France, Germany, Sweden, Holland, Switzerland, and\nBelgium.\nThe historical part of the book is specially devoted to the comparatively-\nlittle known work of the English pioneers, Elliotson, Esdaile, and Braid,\nwhile the final chapter of references contains much information which has\nnot hitherto been published in accessible form.\nThe methods of inducing Hypnotism are exhaustively dealt with and\ninstructions given in regard to the management of the hypnotic state, with\ndetails as to the causes of susceptibility to hypnosis. Hypnotic theories are\ndescribed and discussed, and special prominence is given to Mr. Myers's\ntheory of the subliminal consciousness and the light thrown by it on the\nproblems of hypnotism.\nGRANT RICHARDS, 48 LEICESTER SQUARE, LONDON, W.C.\n\fTHE JOURNAL.\nThe JOURNAL can be obtained, bound in cloth, as under, by Members and\nAssociates :\u2014\nVol. V.

F.\nBarrett, F.R.S., had that afternoon been elected President of\nthe Society for the year 1904, read some extracts from the\nReport of the Council for the year 1903, which is printed\nin full below.\nPROFESSOR BARRETT then delivered a Presidential Address,\nof which we only give a brief summary here, as it will shortly\nbe published in the Proceedings. After referring to the progress\nmade by the Society since its foundation in 1882, the President\nspoke of the Endowment Fund for Psychical Research, which\nwas now a little over \u00a36000 in amount, and to which he\ninvited further contributions, for the purpose of appointing paid\nworkers to supplement the experimentation and research now\ncarried on almost exclusively by volunteers. Two problems,\nwhich needed the co-operation of many workers, urgently\nrequired further investigation ; these were telepathy and motor\nautomatism. In regard to telepathy we need to know whether,\nin some degree, it is a faculty common to the race, whether\nit extends to the life of other animals besides man, etc. We\n\f202 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., ISKM.\nwere as far as ever from understanding the process by which\none mind can influence another at a distance, though it seemed\nprobable that it was through some sub-conscious stratum of\nour personality. The percipient's impression may then be elicited\nby means of motor automatism, in one form or another, and by\ninvestigation of the various forms of automatism we may finally\ndiscover a method by which success in telepathic experiments\ncan be commanded. The subjects of Hypnotism and Spiritualistic\nphenomena were then discussed, and the question of a medium\nor intermediary was shown to have its analogue in physical\nscience, the nexus between the seen and unseen, whether in\nphysical or psychical phenomena, being always a specialised\nsubstance or organism. Further, it seemed highly probable that\na medium was necessary on both sides, here in our present\nenvironment as well as in the unseen environment. The trun\ncated personality which appears to be presented in the trance\ncommunications of Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Thompson was con\nsidered in conclusion.\nShortly after the delivery of his Presidential Address, Professor\nBarrett received the following letter, which we have great\npleasure in printing here :\u2014\n\"THE HERMITAGE, GDILDFORD, February 4<A, 1904.\n\"After listening to your eloquent address at the [last]\nMeeting of the Society, I felt much tempted to introduce\nmyself to you. . . . You appealed to members of the\nSociety in your address to each do something to promote\nits interests, and though I am comparatively a poor man, I\nam prepared to give \u00a350 towards the fund being collected\nto endow a scholarship, provided 19 others, Members or\nAssociates, will do as much. That is, I will at once pay\nover \u00a350 to this fund on learning that 19 others have\ngiven \u00a350, thus completing the \u00a31000; my offer to hold\ngood for the year 1904. I will at once pay over the \u00a350 to\nyou, if you please, to hold till the end of this year ; when if\nthe offer has not succeeded, the money must be returned to me.\n\" MORRIS HUDSON.\"\nProfessor Barrett adds :\u2014\n\" I beg to draw the attention of our members to the above\nletter and generous offer of Mr. Morris Hudson. It is a matter\n\fMAE., 1904. General Meeting. 203\nof urgent importance that the Besearch Fund should as soon as\npossible be raised to \u00a38000, the sum which the Council have\ndecided is the minimum required. I am quite sure that many\nof our members, who cannot give their personal help in our\nenquiries, would be willing to contribute towards the Research\nFund if they but once realised the urgency of the need for\nfurther workers. So far we cannot boast of much assistance\nto the Fund from the general body of our members. Two\nmembers have made anonymous donations amounting to \u00a31000,\nMrs. Hickman (who is not a member) has contributed 50\nguineas, Mr. Best, before he joined the Society, 5 guineas and\nthe Rev. W. S. Grignon, a member, 1 guinea. That completes the\nlist. We have taken from the general funds of the Society\n\u00a31000, and the legacy bequeathed to us by the Hon. Alexander\nAksakof comes to about \u00a34000 ; the total of the Fund amounts\ntherefore at present (including interest) to about \u00a36,200. I\nought perhaps to apologise for thus pressing Mr. Hudson's letter\non the attention of our members ; for when the Fund was started\nthe Council purposely refrained from issuing a general appeal.\nBut when an individual member now comes forward on his own\ninitiative, I feel bound not only to endorse his proposal but to\ncall on others to follow his lead. I hope that any one who\ncannot afford a contribution of \u00a350 will not be deterred from\nsending a smaller sum. Donations should be sent to the Hon.\nTreasurer, Mr. H. Arthur Smith, 7 Queen's Mansions, Brook\nGreen, London, W., or to myself, addressed 6 De Vesci Terrace,\nKingstown, Co. Dublin.\n\"W. F.

Id., and in order to\nbring this sum up to \u00a34000, \u00a3194 16s. lid. was drawn\nfrom the ordinary income of the Society, another \u00a31000\nhaving previously, in accordance with a resolution of Council,\nbeen transferred to the Endowment Fund from the invested\nfunds of the Society. With a few other gifts, reported in the\nJournal at the time, and accumulated interest, the Fund\namounted at the end of 1903 to about \u00a36200.\nThe Treasurer's report shows how the money is invested.\nThis is an encouraging start, but the Fund still falls far short\nof the necessary minimum of \u00a38000, and until this minimum\nsum is attained we have to do without the much-needed\nservices of a Research Scholar.\nOne of the chief obstacles to advance in the work of the\nSociety is that it has to be carried on mainly by unpaid\nworkers, who can devote only their leisure time to it.\nHitherto the expenses\u2014often very considerable\u2014of any work\nbeyond what may be called the official business of the Society,\nincluding the publication of Proceedings, etc., have been de\nfrayed almost entirely by the munificence of a few of our\noriginal Members. Shortly after the death of Mr. Myers the\nCouncil issued an appeal to the members for further and more\ngeneral help in carrying on the ordinary work. This was\nresponded to generously by a few persons, with the result that\nthe Society is now housed in more central and convenient\nquarters, with greater facilities for experimentation, etc., and\nhas been able to add to its paid staff. The increase in\nnumber of members, however, and especially the fact that\nalmost all the correspondence of the Society (answers to\nenquiries, etc.)\u2014is now conducted through the office instead\nof, as used to be the case, through a few of the leading\nmembers, has thrown so much additional labour on the paid\nstaff that experimentation and research still depend chiefly on\nthe few\u2014the very few\u2014unpaid workers who take a genuine\ninterest in the subject. It would be a great advantage to\nhave in addition even one competent student who could devote\nthe whole of his time and energy to it.\n1 Negotiations are in progress by which it is hoped that part at least of this\niluty may be recovered from the Russian Government.\n\fMAR., 1904. Report of the Council. 207\nWith regard to the current accounts for the year, a few\npoints may be noted :\nThe amoxmt received in subscriptions\u2014our most important\nsource of income\u2014is slightly higher than last year ; on the\nother hand, the sale of publications has been decidedly less in\nAmerica, and somewhat less in England. This is an item\nwhich naturally varies greatly from year to year, partly\ndepending on the very variable amount published during the\ntwelvemonth. This year a comparatively small amount has\nbeen published, so that the bill for printing is less than\nusual. An item which appears for the first\u2014and we hope\nthe last\u2014time this year is \u00a39 Os. 3d. for Rates. The Society\nhas now obtained a certificate exempting it, as a scientific\nSociety, from the payment of rates. The balance in hand at\nthe end of the year is larger than usual, amounting to \u00a3578,\nbut much of this will shortly be absorbed in heavy printing\nand other expenses already incurred.\nThere has been a considerable increase in membership during\nthe year. At the beginning of 1903, the numbers were as\nfollows: Ordinary Members 194, Honorary and Corresponding\nMembers, 33 ; Total, 227 ; Ordinary Associates, 543, Honorary\nAssociates, 22 ; Total, 565. During the year, 29 new Mem\nbers were elected and 2 Associates became Members, and one\nHonorary Associate was made a Corresponding Member ; on\nthe other hand, the loss in number of Members through\nvarious causes was 18, leaving a net increase of 14 Mem\nbers. 82 new Associates were elected and 4 Members became\nAssociates ; the loss in number of Associates through various\ncauses was 60 (including 3 Honorary Associates), leaving a\nnet increase of 26 Associates. The total increase of member\nship during the year is thus 40, and the total number of\nMembers and Associates of all classes is now 832. During the\nyear the American Branch has also increased from 511 to 536.\nIn March Mr. N. W. Thomas resigned the post of Organ\nising Secretary, and Miss Alice Johnson was appointed\nSecretary, while retaining her previous post of Editor of the\nProceedings and Journal. In October Miss Larminie, who had\nbeen Assistant for a year, was made Assistant Secretary, and\na Junior Assistant has since been appointed.\nThe Library is now being re-arranged by Mr. E. Westlake,\n\f208 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., 1904.\nthe books being classified under different subjects. It will be\nsupplemented by the purchase of a certain number of standard\nbooks which at present it does not contain, and a complete\nclassified catalogue will shortly be printed which is intended\nto form a sort of bibliography of psychical research. This\nwill give some information to students as to what books exist\non different subjects, and will also facilitate reference to the\ngeneral literature.\nThe necessary task of preparing a single elaborate and\nexhaustive Index to the innumerable topics and cases con\ntained in the Proceedings, Journals, American Proceedings, and\nPhantasms of the Living, is nearing completion. Miss C.\nBurke has been engaged on the work during the last two\nor three years, and the Index is now being printed. It will\nbe prefaced by a complete list of contents of the Proceedings.\nAs it is felt that this Index will only be of use and interest\nto a limited number of members, it will not form part of\nthe series of periodical publications issued free to members\nand associates, but will be on sale to them at terms to be\nannounced later.\nThe satisfactory increase of attendance of members and\nassociates at meetings, noted last year, has been fully main\ntained. Three General and three Private Meetings (for\nMembers and Associates only) were held during the year ;\nthe dates and the papers read were as follows:\n'January 30th. \"Presidential Address\" by SIR OLIVER LODGE,\nF.RS.\nMarch 13th. \"A Case of Secondary Personality\" by PRO\nFESSOR J. H. HYSLOP.\nApril 20th. \"A Further Account of Experiments in Auto\nmatic Writing\" by MRS. A. W. VERRALL.\n*June 18th. \"Some Eeviews and Comments on Mr. Myers'\nHuman Personality \" by MR.

BARRETT, F.RS.\nDecember 7th. \" Types of Phenomena exhibited in Mrs. Thomp\nson's Trances\" by MR. J. G. PIDDINGTON.\n* Those marked with an asterisk were General Meetings.\n\f, 1904. Report of the Council. 209\nThough it was not one of the Society's publications, we\nmay refer to the appearance this year of an important work on\nHypnotism by one of our most distinguished members, Dr. J.\nMilne Bramwell. The book being written primarily for medical\nmen deals chiefly with the therapeutic side of Hypnotism, but\nit contains also a valuable history and discussion of hypnotic\ntheories, as well as a very full bibliography, and treats\nfurther of the psychological aspect, on which Dr. Bramwell's\nown work, and especially his classical experiments on the\nhypnotic appreciation of time, have thrown much light.\nA satisfactory symptom of the advance of our studies in\nthe general estimation is to be found in the marked change\nof tone in the public, and especially in the press, towards the\nsubject as compared with that of only a few years ago.\nPsychical phenomena are now constantly discussed even in.\ndaily papers, the General Meetings of the Society are reported,\nand its work is spoken of almost always with friendliness, if\nnot with respect. Newspaper reporters often come to the\nrooms,\u2014sometimes no doubt with frivolous questions, or merely\nin search of sensations, but occasionally with a little knowledge\nof, or at least an intelligent interest in, the subject. If our\nSociety has done nothing else, it can at least claim the merit\nof having raised the standard of the magazine ghost story.\n\" Ghost stories \" are becoming a favourite topic in the papers,,\nand it may be noted that they are generally recent stories.\nThe majority of them, as our enquiries have shown again and\nagain, are worthless, if not fictitious ; but among the cases\nprinted in the Journal during 1903 three were brought to\nour notice through newspaper paragraphs, and, on investigation,\nseemed to reach a sufficiently high evidential standard to make\nthem worth printing, besides a fourth case, that of an alleged\npremonitory dream, in which investigation showed the accuracy\nof the newspaper statements, though neither the dreamer nor\nourselves regarded the evidence as pointing to more than a\nchance coincidence. A fifth newspaper case which has\nstood the brunt of enquiry is also about to appear in the\nJournal for February, 1904.\nWith regard to dubious cases, two have attracted special\nnotice this year:\u2014the alleged prediction of the Servian murders\nand the diminishing loaves of Beverley Farm. A brief note on\n\f210 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., 1904.\nthe former case was printed in the Journal, and a full analysis\nof the evidence by Mr. Piddington, showing its fundamental\ndefects, was published in Light. A report of the Beverley case\nappears in the Journal for January, 1904.\nWhile good cases from any reputable informant are welcome,\nwe ought not to have to depend so largely as we do on\noutside sources, and the Council must express their disappoint\nment at receiving so small an amount of material from the\nmembers of the Society. No doubt all have not equal oppor\ntunities of contributing; but among the 1362 English, foreign,\nand American members, there must be many who meet now\nand then with phenomena capable of being recorded and in\nvestigated. The records may or may not be worth printing,\nbut they are almost always worth making ; and the officers\nof the Society are always glad to receive them, and are\nprepared to help investigators as far as possible.\nBesides the investigation of spontaneous cases, a certain\namount of experimental work has been carried on at the\nRooms. In the summer a series of sittings was held with a\nmedium who practised \" clairvoyance \" professionally and was\nsaid to be developing physical phenomena in private. The\nmedium and her husband, who accompanied her to all sittings\nafter the first (when nothing occurred), gave detailed accounts\nof various phenomena, such as \" direct writing,\" etc., occurring\nin their own house, and brought specimens of the writing.\nBoth the accounts and the specimens were suggestive of\ntrickery ; and when the medium, with her own consent, was\nsearched before' one of the sittings, half a dozen trick\nplaying cards were found in her pocket, corresponding exactly\nto what would have been required to produce one of the per\nformances she had described. A careful cross-examination\nproved later that she had brought these cards with her\ndeliberately. At the sittings, one phenomenon only occurred,\u2014\nthe appearance of a bunch of cherries under the medium's\nchair,\u2014and under conditions which she herself and her husband\nadmitted at the time to be quite inconclusive. She attempted\nalso to obtain clairvoyant impressions with regard to the sitters,\nbut with no success.\nIn the autumn, arrangements had been made for sittings\nwith a well known professional trance medium. These unfortu\n\f, 190*. Report of the Council. 211\nnately fell through, as she was unable to attend, owing to the\nillness of one of her relatives.\nExperiments in thought-transference were conducted at\nintervals during the autumn with some members of the\nSociety. Unfortunately the success 'obtained was not above\nchance, though there seemed some slight indications of improve\nment as the experiments went on, and it is hoped that the\nexperimenters will persevere with them.\nAnother series was arranged on a novel principle, as follows :\nSix experimenters were involved, all in different places, five\nbeing agents and one the percipient, and none knowing who\nthe others were. One experiment was tried every day, each\nexperimenter acting as percipient for a week and agent the\nrest of the time. A central organiser, Colonel Taylor, arranged\nthe parts to be played by each, informed the agents daily on\nwhat they were to concentrate their thoughts, and received\ndaily from the percipient a record of his impressions. After\nsix weeks, the whole record was tabulated. The objects chosen\nfor transference were the numbers from 10 to 99, selected by\nlot every day by Colonel Taylor, so that the amount of success\nattributable to chance might be calculated. The total success\nobtained was not beyond what chance might have produced,\nthough with one percipient, out of six experiments, one digit\nwas guessed correctly in three cases.\nMembers are urged to repeat these or similar experiments.\nThe evidence for thought-transference must necessarily be more\nconvincing when the experimenters are at a distance from one\nanother, and there is no proof that success is more difficult\nunder those conditions ; it has been obtained thus before, and\nno doubt may be obtained again, if trials are made by a\nsufficiently large number of persons. At the same time, if\nenough care is taken as to the conditions, experiments with\nagent and percipient in the same room may also be very\nvaluable. The Eooms of the Society can occasionally be used\nafter office hours for purposes of experiment by members or\nassociates. Application should be made to the Secretary.\nLast year was marked by the appearance of Professor William\nJames's brilliant and suggestive work on The Varieties oj\nReligious Experience, in which the far-reaching importance to\npsychology of Mr. Myers's conception of the subliminal self\n\f212 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., 1904.\nwas for the first time recognised by a psychologist of acknow\nledged pre-eminence. This year will be still more memorable\nin the history of psychical research as the date of publication\nof Mr. Myers's own book, Human Personality. Not only had\nthe book an immediate success, far beyond the most sanguine\nexpectations, and certainly far beyond the calculations of the\npublishers, but it has created a deep and widely spread\ninterest in the subject which seems likely to be permanent.\nIt is undoubtedly in great part to its appearance that the\nalteration of tone in the press and the public already referred to\nis due, and the change has affected not the newspaper reader\nalone, but the most serious and intelligent part of the reading\ncommunity.\nThe Council feel that it is more than ever incumbent on\nthe Society to live up to the opportunity thus created for it.\nWhat has hampered advance in the past is the sustained\nindifference of the great mass of members ; what will aid advance\nin the future is individual effort on the part of all who have\nopportunities. It is not enough to throw out suggestions for\nsome one else to do something,\u2014a course which appears to\ncommend itself to a good many of our members.\nA great part of the work that has to be done consists\nof uninteresting details, and is unlikely to reflect any kvdos\non the workers. To take a single instance : a large amount\nof time has been spent this year, and for nearly twenty years\npast, by the Hon. Treasurer on routine work. If this work\nwere to stop, the business affairs of the Society would soon\nbe in hopeless confusion : as long as it goes on, they retain\nan order which effectively shrouds both them and the Treasurer\nfrom the public view.\nFurther, as in all scientific work, it may be necessary to\ngo on a long time without producing results of any obvious\ninterest or value. Much of our work must still be tentative\nand still preliminary ; but looking back on what has been\naccomplished since the foundation of the Society in 1882,\nwe have every reason to hope for the future.\n\fNOTICES.\nCOUNCIL MEETING.\nThe next MEETING of the COUNCIL will be held on MONDAY, March 21st\nat 4.30 p.m.\nGENERAL MEETING OF THE SOCIETY.\nThe next General Meeting will be held in the Hall at 20 Hanover\nSquare, London, W., on MONDAY, March 21st, 1904, at 8.30 p.m.\nA Paper on\n\"A CASE or MULTIPLE PERSONALITY\"\nwill be read by\nALBERT WILSON, M.D., (Edin.),\n(Late President of the Royal Medical Society of Edinburgh.)\nMembers and Associates will be admitted on signing their names at the\ndoor.

APBIL, 1904.\nGHOST STORIES OF 100 YEARS AGO: A WARNING\nTO \"GHOSTS\" AND TO PSYCHICAL RESEARCHERS\nOF THE PRESENT DAY.\nBY SIR AUGUSTUS K. STEPHENSON, K.C.B., K.C.\nIN the Times newspaper of the 15th, 16th, 17th, and 18th\nof January of the present year are given \"extracts\" from the\nTimes of 1804 for the corresponding dates.\nFrom the Editorial observations it would appear that certain\nother newspapers had accused the Times of having fabricated or\nresuscitated an old story of 1 0 years previous\u2014of having\n\" conjured up a Ghost without a head and stationed its haunts\nin St. James's Park.\"\nThe Times thereupon printed the two following \" declarations \"\nmade and signed by two private soldiers of the Coldstream Guards,\nbefore Officers of the Regiment.\nThe following is a copy of a declaration made and signed before\nan Officer :\n\" I do solemnly declare, that, whilst on guard at the Recruit\nhouse, on or about the 3rd instant, about half past one o'clock\nin the morning, I perceived the figure of a woman, without a\nhead, rise from the earth, at the distance of about three feet\nbefore me. I was so alarmed at the circumstance, that I had not\npower to speak to it, which was my wish to have done ; but I\n\u2022distinctly observed that the figure was dressed in a red striped\ngown with red spots between each stripe, and that part of the\ndress and figure appeared to me to be enveloped in a cloud.\n\" In about the space of two seconds, whilst my eyes were fixed\non the object, it vanished from my sight. I was perfectly sober\nand collected at the time, and, being in great trepidation, called\nto the next sentinel, who met me about half way, and to whom\nI communicated the strange sight I had seen.\n(Signed) \" GEORGE JONES,\n\"of Lieutenant-Colonel TAYLOR'S Company of\n\" Coldstream Guards.\n\"Westminster, Jan. 15, 1804.\"\nTo the declaration of JONES we have to add another, connected\nwith the subject, and which is equally genuine:\u2014\n\" I do hereby declare, that, whilst on guard behind the Armoury-\nhouse (to the best of my recollection about three weeks ago), I\n\fAPRIL, 1904. Ohost Stories of One Hundred Years Ago. 215\nheard, at twelve o'clock at night, a tremendous noise, which pro\nceeded from the window of an uninhabited house, near to the\nspot where I was upon duty. At the same time, I heard a voice\ncry out, 'Bring me a light! bring me a light!' The last sentence\nwas uttered in so feeble and so changeable tone of voice, that I\nconcluded some person was ill, and consequently offered them my\nassistance to procure a light. I could, however, obtain no answer\nto my proposal, although I repeated it several times, and as often\nheard the voice use the same terms. I endeavoured to see the\nperson who called out, but in vain. On a sudden the violent\nnoise was renewed, which appeared to me to resemble sashes of\nwindows lifted hastily up and down, but then they were moved\nin such quick succession, and at different parts of the house nearly\nat the same time, that it seemed impossible to me that one person\ncould accomplish the whole business. I heard several of the regi\nment say they have heard similar noises and proceedings, but I\nhave never heard the cause accounted for.\n(Signed) \" RICHARD DONKIN,\n\"12th Company of Coldstream Guards\n\"Whitehall, Jan. 15, 1804.\"\nThe Times then adds :\nAfter furnishing the above documents, we shall hardly be again\naccused of having framed the account in Friday's Paper, from a\ncircumstance which occurred ten years ago.\nIt may be convenient here, for the sake of reference, to note\nthe three stories referred to in the above declarations and in\na report of proceedings at Bow Street given below as :\n. (1) The St. James's Park Ghost.\n(2) The uninhabited or \"haunted\" house in which voices\nand noises were heard.\n(3) The Hammersmith Ghost.\n(1) and (2) were disposed of, so far as we now know, by the\nfollowing paragraphs in the Times of 16th and 17th January,\n1804.\nThe Ghost in St. James's Park, we understand, originated in an\napplication of the PhantHsmagoria, by two unlucky Westminster\nScholars, who having got possession of an empty house on the\nside of the Bird-cage walk, were enabled to produce the appear\nance which so greatly alarmed the sentinels on duty in the im\n\f216 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1904.\nmediate vicinity of the spot, and has given such an extraordinary\nsubject to the curiosity of the public.\nThe house referred to in (2) must have been one in Spring\nGardens, on the site of which the new Admiralty Buildings now\nstand, and the \" Westminster Scholars \" may have been respon\nsible for the voices and noises.\nThe Times of January 17th, 1804, has the following:\nPARK GHOST.\nPUBLIC-OFFICE, BOW STREET.\nYesterday George Jones, of Lieut.-Colonel Taylor's Company of\nColdstream Guards, whose declaration respecting the Park Ghost\nwe yesterday published, was brought before Sir Richard Ford, to\nbe interrogated respecting the sight he was supposed to have seen.\nPrevious to his examination, Mr. Stafford, the Chief Clerk, endeavoured\nto find out whether his imagination had received any impressions\nfrom reading any dismal st\u00bbry, or if he had, at the time the phantom\nappeared to him, suffered the story of the Hammersmith Ghost\nto dwell on his mind, in order, if possible, to ascertain if he had\nbeen misled by his fancies. To these questions he answered in\nthe negative. On being asked respecting the strange object he had\nseen, he solemnly declared that he was ready at any time to make\noath to what he had stated, and that he firmly believed he had\nseen a ghost. He detailed everything in Court as near as possible\nto what we yesterday inserted under his own signature.\nIt may be here observed that it does not appear on what\ncharge, if any, George Jones was \"brought before\" the magistrate\nat Bow Street ; any military offence, such as sleeping on guard,\nwould have been dealt with by his regimental officers ; possibly\nsome charge was made against the \" unlucky Westminster\nScholars\"; but however that may be, we may consider (1) and\n(2) as disposed of, and confine our attention to (3) \"The\nHammersmith Ghost,\" the reference to which by the Chief\nClerk at Bow Street can be explained by the records contained\nin two volumes of the Annual Register for the year 1804,\nfrom which may be gathered the following particulars :\nThere appears to have been some change in the editorship\nof the Annual Register for 1803-4, which may explain the\n\fAPRIL, 190*. Ghost Stories of One Hundred Yearn Ago. 217\nexistence of two volumes of the Register for that year, one of\nwhich contains a very condensed report of a trial at the Old\nBailey on the loth of January of that year of one Francis\nSmith for murder of one Millward, and the other a detailed\nreport of a Coroner's Inquisition on Millward's body, with a\nfuller report of Smith's trial, which latter report, however,\nomits altogether a most material circumstance connected with\nthe result of that trial, as recorded in the other volume.\nKeferring to these three reports, the following may be taken\nas a summary of the circumstances connected with No. 3, the\nHammersmith Ghost of 1804.\nFor some five weeks previous to January, 1804, the in\nhabitants of Hammersmith, (then a suburban village of scattered\nhouses, connected by dark unfrequented lanes, bounded in places\nby high hedges), had been alarmed by the frequent appearances\nof \" a Ghost,\" described as dressed sometimes entirely in white,\nsometimes in the skin of a cow or other wild beast. One witness\nat the trial of Smith said he and a fellow servant had met the\nGhost one night in the churchyard, that he touched it and felt\nsomething soft, but whatever it was, it disappeared. Another\nwitness had met and given chase to the Ghost, who only\nescaped by throwing away the sheet in which he was en\nveloped, and so outrunning his pursuer, who however got near\nenough to say that this Ghost was a tall man wearing a\ndark coat with shiny metal buttons. It also appeared that\ntwo clergymen had each offered a reward of five guineas for the\ncapture of the Ghost, and that several persons had gone ghost\nhunting armed with guns, etc., but without success ; until on\nthe 3rd January, 1804, a certain Mr. Francis Smith, an excise\nofficer, went out for the declared purpose of looking for the\nGhost, carrying a fowling piece loaded with shot, and having\ntaken the precaution to arrange with \" a watchman,\" who carried\na pistol, that if they two met in the dark, they should challenge\neach other. Smith did meet a figure in white, in a dark lane\nwith high hedges, and was heard by a witness who gave evidence\nat his trial to say, \" Damn you, who are you ? speak or I'll\nshoot ! \" Smith's own account as given to the jury at his trial\nwas that the figure gave no answer but \"came on.\" Smith there\nupon fired, and at such close quarters that he practically nearly\nblew the Ghost's head off, blackening its face with gunpowder.\n\f218 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1904.\nThe Ghost fell to the ground, and Smith immediately went for\nassistance, and was no doubt terribly distressed, and insisted\non giving himself up to the Police. The Ghost (on this occasion)\nturned out to be one Millward, a respectable bricklayer, with\nwhom Smith was slightly acquainted, but there was no sug\ngestion of any ill-will between them. Millward on the night\nin question was wearing a white jacket with white trousers\ndown to his heels ; he had previously been mistaken for the\nGhost and had been warned about his dress. It is not clear\nwhether he was on this particular night masquerading as the\nGhost, and from the evidence of his relatives, and the description\nof the Ghost as seen by another witness, he certainly was not\nthe only Ghost, for he was not the tall man with dark coat\nand shiny buttons enveloped in a sheet, and it is not clear\nwhether there were more Hammersmith Ghosts than one, besides\nthe original genuine Ghost, if he ever existed.\nUnder these circumstances, the coroner, while expressing\nsympathy with Smith's and Millward's families, very properly\ndirected the jury to return a verdict of wilful murder against\nSmith, so that the circumstances might be further investigated.\nThis the Coroner's jury did and Smith was tried a few days\nafterwards at the Old Bailey on the Coroner's inquisition,\nbefore the Lord Chief Baron Macdonald.\nSmith was assisted by Counsel, who at that time were not\nallowed to address the jury, but who called and examined\nwitnesses on Smith's behalf. The witnesses gave Smith an\nexcellent character for humanity and respectability, and Smith\nhimself addressed the jury admitting all the tacts, and expressing\nthe greatest sorrow for the fatal result. The Lord Chief Baron\nin a most careful charge explained the law to the jury, telling\nthem that there was no justification in anything urged by\nSmith, that the facts did not admit of a verdict of manslaughter,\nand that their duty was to find Smith guilty of wilful murder.\nThe jury, however, after long consideration, returned a verdict\nof manslaughter.\nThe Lord Chief Baron refused to receive the verdict, and\nafter conferring with the two other judges, Lawrence and Kooke,\nand the .Recorder, who all three expressed themselves as in\nentire agreement with the law as laid down by the L. C. B., told\nthe jury to reconsider their verdict, which must be either not\n\fAPRIL, 19M. Ghost Stories of One Hundred Years Ago. 219\nguilty or guilty of murder. The jury then returned a verdict\nof wilful murder.\nThe Lord Chief Baron thereupon passed sentence of death\nin the usual form, to be carried into execution on the following\nMonday. And there the report in one of the volumes of the\nAnnual Register ends !\nIn the other volume it is, however, stated that a reprieve\nwas obtained that very night, and the sentence commuted into\none of a year's imprisonment in Newgate.\nI have also found a note of the trial of Smith at the Old\nBailey, which purports to be from an MS. report of Mr. Justice\nBayley. (There were no Old Bailey official reports in those\ndays, as there are now.) This shows that the case is good law,\nas it is accepted as such, and referred to in the text-books. The\npassage occurs in Vol. I. of Russell on Crimes under the heading\n\"Murder,\" Book III., Section V., 3rd Edition, p. 546, with a\nmarginal note, \" Killing a person who is committing a mis\ndemeanour,\" and is as follows :\nIt is no excuse for killing a man that he was out at night as a\nGhost dressed in white for the purpose of alarming the neighbour\nhood, even though he could not otherwise be taken. The\nneighbourhood of Hammersmith had been alarmed by what was\nsupposed to be a Ghost; the prisoner went out with a loaded gun\nto take the Ghost ; and upon meeting with a person dressed in white,\nimmediately shot him. Macdonald, C.B., Rooke and Lawrence,\nJ.J., were clear this was murder, as the person who appeared as a\nGhost was guilty only of a misdemeanour ; and no one might kill\nhim, though he could not otherwise be taken. The jury, however,\nbrought in a verdict of manslaughter; but the Court said that they\ncould not receive that verdict ; and told the jury that, if they\nbelieved the evidence, they must find the prisoner guilty of murder ;\nand if they did not believe the evidence, they should acquit the\nprisoner.

LI^BEAULT.\nBY the death of the venerable Dr. Liobeault the S.P.R. loses a\ndistinguished and valued Corresponding Member. He died at\nNancy, on February 18th, 1904, in his 81st year, after a pro\nlonged illness. Auguste Ambroise Lit-beault was born at Favieres\n(Meurthe), in 1823, and studied medicine at the University of\nStrasburg, where he took his M.D. degree in 1850. He started\npractice in the small town of Pont-Saint-Vincent, and lived there\nfor some years the ordinary life of a hard working country\ndoctor. At College he had become interested in the psychical\nside of medicine, and he soon began to use hypnotism in his\npractice. In 1864 he removed into Nancy and the house in\nwhich he lived for the remainder of his life. There he\nopened a dispensary for the free treatment of the poor, and\nin this he worked for many years, appreciated by a large\nclientele drawn from the poor of the district, but ignored and\nmisrepresented by the medical profession. In 1866 he pub\nlished his first book, Le Sommeil et les Hats analogues, con-\nsidtris surtout au point de vue de faction du moral sur le\nphysique, a work which shows great power of observation and\nresearch, but for which there was no demand.\nIt was not until 1882 that the attention of Dr. Bernheim,\nprofessor of medicine in the University, was directed to\nLidbeault through some remarkable cures, and he became an\nattendant and pupil at the unpretentious Clinique in the Rue\nde Bellevue.\nAfter a short period of scepticism Bernheim became an\nenthusiastic adherent, and began to use hypnotism on a large\nscale in the wards of the Nancy general hospital. His\nposition enabled him to compel attention, and he was joined in\nhis researches by Beaunis, professor of physiology, and Liegeois,\nprofessor of law\u2014a remarkable trinity of talent, which was\n\f222 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1904.\nthe foundation of what is termed the Nancy School of Sugges\ntion. Liebeault thus had the good fortune to see his character\nvindicated and his theories widely accepted. His modest dis\npensary was visited by medical investigators from all parts of\nthe world, and many of his pupils have established successful\ncliniques in the cities of Europe and America.\nHis enthusiasm, geniality, and kindness of heart won the\nhearts of all who knew him, and in 1890, when he retired from\npractice on a modest competence, he was the recipient of a\nremarkably cosmopolitan testimonial, subscribed to by about\nfifty medical pupils and admirers from all parts of the world.\nThe presentation was made at a banquet at Nancy, presided\nover by the late Professor Dumontpallier, of the Hotel Dieu,\nParis, and was the occasion of much eloquence.\nDr. Milne Bramwell has shown in the Proceedings of the\nS.P.R. and elsewhere that James Braid not only evolved\nhypnotism, the name and method, from the discredited theories\nof mesmerism, but also understood and practised suggestion,\nespecially in his later years ; but the English surgeon left no\nfollowers, and when he died in I860 psycho-therapy, so far\nas the medical profession was concerned, may be said to have\nbecome extinct. It is to the genius of Lidbeault as well as\nto his enthusiasm and singleness of heart that we owe the\nfull recognition of the part played by suggestion, verbal or\notherwise, in psychical research, as well as in the cure of\ndisease.\nProbably the very retirement and obscurity in which he\nlived tended to the final triumph of his theories, for he was\nthus enabled to work quietly, and to accumulate the store of\nfacts and experience which at last convinced inquirers. His\ntheory, shortly expressed, is that disease depends upon mis\ndirection of nervous energy, there being sometimes a super\nfluity in certain organs which may lead, e.g., to neuralgia or\nepilepsy ; and at other times a deficiency which may produce, e.g.,\nparalysis or neurasthenia. Hypnotism, by means of suggestion\nacting on the highest brain centres, enables the physician to\nconcentrate the attention on the affected part, and bring about\nredistribution of energy and consequent restitutio ad integrum.\nDr. Liebeault had no children, but his widow and adopted\ndaughter survive him. CHAS. LLOYD TUCKEY, M.D.\n\fAPRIL, 1904. Cones. 223\nCASES.\nP. 276. Dream.\nThe following case was obtained for us by the Rev. A. T. Fryer.\nWe are requested not to print the names of the persons con\ncerned, all of which were given to us in full. The first account\nof the case was contained in a letter addressed to Mr. Fryer,\nas follows :\u2014\nDectmlier \\0th, 1903.\nDEAR MR. FRYER,\u2014I believe the following will interest you :\u2014\nA young lady lives with us who is a Kindergarten Teacher.\nShe is the intimate friend and companion of her head-mistress, who\nwas engaged to be married next Christmas.\nShe often went for walks and outings with the affianced couple.\nBoth were dear to her. He was Art Master at the Pupil Teachers'\nCentre, . One morning about three weeks ago our young lady\ncame down to breakfast in a very excited and gloomy state, ami said\nthat she had been terribly upset by an awful but very vivid dream.\nShe had dreamt that the Art Master had been suddenly taken\nill, and that the Head- Mistress had gone to nurse him, but that in\nspite of every effort they had failed to save his life.\nI said \" Pooh, pooh, dreams go by the contrary, it refers to the\nwedding.\"\nShe said, \" It has upset me very much ; it seemed so real.\" That\nday she asked her friend how her fianc\u00a3 was, who answered that\nhe was splendid. \" Because,\" said she, \" I dreamt last night he\nwas very ill.\"\n\"Oh,\" replied her friend, \"he was as strong as a lion last night\nanyhow.\"\nDuring the day she remarked, \" I shall be glad to see him to-night,\nyour dream has made me somewhat anxious.\"\nShe met him and found that he had contracted a slight cold. The\nslight cold lasted a fortnight and then developed into pneumonia.\nHis fiancee went to nurse him. Every effort was made to save him,\nbut he was buried at churchyard yesterday. . . .\nMr. Fryer sent a series of questions to his informant, the\nRev. J. G., to be answered by himself and the dreamer, and\nthe questions and answers are next given, with the exception\nof those relating to the names of the witnesses :\u2014\nQ. Are there any circumstances which will serve to fix the exact\ndate of dream, and hour '\n\f224 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1904.\nAns. This question has caused us some difficulty. So far we\nhave discovered that the dream took place on the night following\nthe report of two burglaries at Newport. If this is important, I\nwill endeavour to get you the date.\nThe dream took place about the middle of the night.\nQ. Was any written note made by the dreamer at the time ; in\ndiary or elsewhere 1\nAns. No.\nQ. Will the dreamer write out her dream in, as nearly as possible,\nthe words used to you and to the head mistress?\nAns. Mrs. J. G. told me she had a had night, and I told her\nI had had a very strange dre;im and could not sleep afterwards as\nit preyed on my mind. I dreamt that Mr. D was very ill, and\nMiss N and I were nursing him ; he looked very thin and\nhaggard, and he was stout and robust in appearance, and he was\nso patient, but was very feverish. We nursed him between us, and\nI did most of the running about, while she did not leave him. I\ndreamt that he died, and that he appeared very like a doctor friend\nof mine in Liverpool. In my dream a horrid feeling crept over me\nat the idea of the undertaker coming, and this woke me up. I told\nthe Rev. and Mrs. J. G. the whole of my dream as above, but only\ntold Miss N a part of the dream, as follows : \" I had a horrid\ndream about Mr. D last night.\" She replied, \"What was it?\"\nI said, \"It was strange, too, because I had not been thinking or talking\nabout him beforehand. I dreamt he was very ill and you and I were\nnursing him. I could see him and the room quite vividly, and he\nlooked so thin but feverish, and we had very soft slippers on and\nmade as little noise as possible.\" She said, \"I (shall be anxious to\nsee him, although he was perfectly well last night.\" Then I laughed\nand said, \"Dreams go by opposites.\" We then dropped the con\nversation. My part of the fulfilment re nursing. When he was ill\nI used to fetch medicine, fruit, fish, etc., for Miss N to take\nto him. On one occasion I had agreed to meet a certain train with\nfruit, etc. for Miss N to take to (the place where he lived).\nMiss N had gone by an earlier train, so 1 took them by train\nmyself. Upon arriving at the house' Miss N met me and was\nso pleased I had come. She showed me into the drawing room.\nAlthough I am not superstitious, the first thing I noticed was the\nabundance of peacocks' feathers in the room. I said, \"Those things\nare supposed to be very unlucky.\" She laughed and said, \" Well, he\nhasn't had any luck since he put them up.\" I did not see him, and\n\fAPRIL, 1904. Cases. 225\nnever for one moment thought that he was dangerously ill. It was\nthat night that he passed away. (Signed) E. M.\nQ Has the dreamer ever had a similar experience?\nAns No.\nQ. Or any of her relatives ?\nAns. Not that I know of ...\nQ. Is the head-mistress quite certain that the Art Master had\nmade no reference to his health on the evening previous to the dream T\nAns. Yes, quite.\nQ Date of death ?\nAns. December 4th, 1903.\nQ. Date of list interview with the Art Master previous to the\ndream 1\nAns. November 20th, 1903.\nQ. When did the dreamer relate her conversation with the head\nmistress to you ]\nAnx. The day after the dream.\nQ. Had the dreamer ever had any suspicion of the Art Master's\nreal condition of health 1\nAns. No, not the least, he always looked and was considered\nvery strong.\nQ. Did any friends of the Art Master know of or suspect hia-\n\" cold \" on the night of the dream 1\nAns. No.\nQ. If the master was so well as the head-mistress thought, on-\nthe evening previous to the dream, when did he contract the cold\nwhich she says he had the day following 1\nAns. He contracted a slight cold November 21st, at Mr.\nChamberlain's meeting.\nMr. Fryer then wrote to the Head-Mistress, Miss N ,\nasking for her corroboration, and received the following reply :\nDecember 22nd, 1903.\nI ... regret that I can recollect very little concerning Miss M.'s\ndream, as far as the date and time of day when she related some\naccount of it to me.\nAs far as I remember it was either three or four weeks before my\nfriend's death. I believe three weeks ; and he died on the 4th inst.\nMiss M came to me during morning school, asking me was\nhe well, for she had been dreaming that he was very ill, and that\nshe and I nursed him. She also said that, though he appeared to.\n\f226 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1904.\nbe really seriously ill, and extremely weak, he was wonderfully\npatient, and as good-humoured as when in good health. Miss\nM withheld the latter portion of her dream, fearing to distress\nme, and I did not learn until afterwards that she also dreamed\nthat she saw him die. . . . My sister tells me that on the\nday before she received the sad news grandpa told her that he\ndreamt he saw a letter, and distinctly read news of a friend's death.\nHe is an old gentleman of 81 years, and nearly blind. He said\nhe could not make out who the friend was. I may add that he\nwas not aware of my engagement to Mr. D , neither did he\nknow that I was in trouble of any kind. His dream does not\nappear to have given him any idea that the dream-letter had any\nconnection with me.\nMay I quote another curious experience, which may, or may not,\nbe connected with the same chain of events 1\nIn the early part of this last October I saw an apparition of my\nmother. At the time I was not sleeping, but was most wide awake,\nsitting up in bed studying, and my room well lighted with electric\nlight. My attention was arrested by what I thought was a reflec\ntion, but on looking closely to my left I saw a remarkably distinct\nfigure of my mother. I cannot account for the expeiience in any\nway. I am not given to dreaming, and have never had such an\nexperience before, or since. The strangest part of the occurrence\nseemed to me to be the fact that I was not in the least disturbed\nor frightened. I wondered at it, and decided to abandon my books\nfor the night and settle to sleep. The time of the appearance must\nhave been shortly after midnight. My mother died nine years ago,\non October llth, and I had not been thinking of her at the time.\nI was, in fact, too busy to be thinking of anything outside my\nwork. . . .\nMr. Fryer writes :\n2 NEWPORT ROAD, CARDIFF, January 27th, 1904.\nI went to Newport on Monday last and saw Miss N . She is\nquite positive about the fact of the dream having been told her before\nshe knew that Mr. D had [been] taken ill. Miss M is now\nin N. Wales, but she has sent me her signature to her account.\nThere is no doubt about the fact of the burglaries, and consequent\ntalk about them before the Chamberlain meeting. . . .\nIn answer to further enquiries about the exact date of\nMiss M.'s dream, Mr. J. G. wrote to Mr. Fryer as follows :\u2014\n\fAPRIL, 1904. Cases. 227\nJanuary 2&lh, 1904.\nI obtained information at the Newport Police Station that the\nburglaries in question took place on the night of November 17th,\n1903. This is later than we thought. It is difficult to fix the exact\nsequence of events unless a record is kept. I fully thought that\nthe dream took place about a fortnight before Mr. Chamberlain's\nmeeting. I called at the Argus office to obtain a copy of the Argus\nwhich contained an account of the burglaries, for the date of the\ndream must be fixed from the account in the Argus.\nThey will supply me to-morrow with copies of the 17th, 18th,\nand 1'Jth of November. I will forward you the necessary copy.\nThe dream took place on the night after the burglary news in\nthe Argus; Mr. Chamberlain's meeting, Nov. 21st.\nMr. Fryer afterwards obtained for us a copy of the Argus\nfor Wednesday, November 18th, 1903. In this a burglary\nis reported to have taken place at Newport on the previous\nSunday night, and another one early on the Tuesday evening.\nIt seems to be the latter occasion that Mr. J. G. referred\nto. The same paper announces that Mr. Chamberlain will\naddress a meeting at the Tredegar Hall, Newport, on Satur\nday, November 21st, at 3.30 p.m. If, therefore, Mr. G.'s\nrecollection is correct as to Miss M.'s dream having happened\non the Wednesday night, and having been told to him on the\nThursday morning, this confirms the statement that her dream\nwas related before there was any suspicion of Mr. D.'s illness,\nsince, in fact, the illness apparently resulted from a cold caught\nat the meeting of November 21st.\nFinally Mr. Fryer sent us a letter from the clergyman who\nofficiated at Mr. D.'s funeral, stating that the latter had caught\na cold which developed into influenza, followed by acute\npneumonia, and that he died on December 4th.\nL. 1137. Dream.\nThe following case of a coincidental dream was sent to us\nby an Associate of the Society, Mr. Wilfred Hall, of Priors\nTerrace, Tynemouth, Northumberland, in a letter dated January\n4th, 1904, in which he informed us that the accounts were\nfurnished to him by a friend of his who was acquainted with\nthe ladies concerned. The first account is written by the\ndreamer, Miss M. Kobson.\n\f228 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1904.\nOn Monday, September 28th, Miss Elliott casually said to me\nthat she intended going to Sunderland on the following Saturday,\nto see a friend.\nThat night I had a vivid dream : Miss Elliot came to me to show\na letter which she had received from her Sunderland friend, asking\nher to postpone her visit, as bad news\u2014some family trouble\u2014necessi\ntated her immediate departure.\nI was much surprised when on the next day I told this dream\nto hear that a letter in actually the same words had been that\nmorning received by Miss Elliott.\nI may add I do not profess to attach any importance to dreams,\nand it is quite an unusual thing for me to relate one.\nM. EOBSON.\nE. M. ELLIOTT.\nMiss Elliott corroborates as follows :\u2014\nGATKSHKAD, November 25th, 1903.\nSome time ago I mentioned to Miss Robson that I had to go to\nSunderlaiid on a certain day to see a friend.\nOn the morning of. the day on which I had arranged to go, I\nreceived a post-card asking me to postpone my visit, as my friend\nhad had some very bad news about a sister living at some distance.\nThis news was totally unexpected, and was a great shock to me,\nas I know all the family well.\nWhen I saw Miss Robson an hour or so afterwards, almost her\nfirst words to me were : \" Oh, I had such a strange and vivid dream\nlast night.\" and then she proceeded to tell me her dream, which\nwas in all respects what had really happened, even to the wording\nof the post-card.\nI may say Miss Robson knows my friend Miss Smith, but has\nnever met her sister. E. M. ELLIOTT.\nIn reply to questions, Mr. Hall writes to us on January\n22nd, 1904:\u2014\nThe name and address of the friend of Miss Robson and Miss\nElliott is Dr. Louis Kornitzer, Holly Cottage, Monkseaton, Nor\nthumberland.\nAt the time of forwarding the communication Miss Robson's address\nwas Miss M. Robson, 3 Richmond Terrace, Felling-on-Tyne, and Miss\nElliott's was Miss E. M. Elliott, 35 Peterboro Street, Gateshead.\nMiss Smith is a real, and not an assumed name. Miss Smith's\naddress is Miss E. Smith, Albion House, Sunderland.\nMiss Robson states that she has not had any similar experiences.\nI may say that none of the persons referred to have any objection\nto their names and addresses appearing in the Journal, if you would\nlike to publish same.

The author gives the results of\ntwelve years of his own practice and research, with personal observations\nof the work done in France, Germany, Sweden, Holland, Switzerland, and\nBelgium.\nThe historical part of the book is specially devoted to the comparatively\nlittle known work of the English pioneers, Elliotson, Esdaile, and Braid,\nwhile the final chapter of references contains much information which has\nnot hitherto been published in accessible form.\nThe methods of inducing Hypnotism are exhaustively dealt with and\ninstructions given in regard to the management of the hypnotic state, witti\ndetails as to the causes of susceptibility to hypnosis. Hypnotic theories are\ndescribed and discussed, and special prominence is given to Mr. Myers's\ntheory of the subliminal consciousness and the light thrown by it on the\nproblems of hypnotism.\nGRANT RICHARDS, 48 LEICESTER SQUARE, LONDON, W.C.\n\fTHE JOURNAL.\nThe early numbers of the JOURNAL having now been reprinted, it can be\nobtained, bound in cloth, as under, by Members and Associates:\u2014\nVol. I.

F. Barrett,\nin the chair.\nDR. ALBERT WILSON read a paper on \" A Case of Multiple\nPersonality,\" of which the following is an abstract :\nThe object of this paper is to demonstrate that the Mind or\nCharacter, the \" Ego,\" which is the sum total of our personality\nand individuality, is composed of several minor \" egos,\" good\nand bad. The minor \" egos \" being subject to the laws of health,\nheredity, and environment, must vary, and this opens up the\ngreat question of the day as to individual responsibility.\nWe must first try to obtain a broad, general idea of the\nstructure of the nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system\naccompanies every blood vessel, regulating the blood supply.\nWhen it allows the vessels to dilate, this produces blushing or\ncongestion and inflammation. When it causes the vessels to\ncontract, the result is pallor, chilblains, numb or ' dead ' fingers,\nsick-headache, etc., according to the part affected. If the same\nprocesses take place in the delicate brain structure, we find con\ngestive headache, delirium, or mania from dilatation ; while from\nspasm of the arteries, shutting off the blood supply, we get\nparalysis of different functions, such as speech, sight or walking,\netc. The surface of the brain is mapped out into functional\nareas for sight, smell, taste, hearing, and motor and sensory\n\f232 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAT, 1904.\nfunctions, and the microscope reveals to us that this surface\nor cortex is divided into five layers of cells.\nDr. S. A. Watson (by whose courtesy I refer to what is\nnot yet generally known) has discovered that the deeper\nlayers are the most ancient and more fully represented in\nthe lower animals. They are concerned with the voluntary\ninstincts for protection, production and preservation. The outer,\nmore superficial layer we call the pyramidal layer ; and it is\nthe seat of the higher intellectual faculties. Consequently it\nis more highly developed in man, being deeper and thicker than\nin the lower animals. The additional thickness is always on\nthe external surface, as slates are the latest stage in the growth\nof a building.\nIf the pyramidal layer is diseased, mental deterioration and\ninsanity result. If'weakened by poisons, as alcohol, or bad air,\nor if badly nourished, then perverted or defective mental action\nis observed. Thus, in a person suffering from chronic alcoholism\nI found the outer part of the pyramidal layer destroyed, which\nfully accounted for her irresponsibility.\nSo that when this layer is damaged the individual is at once\nplaced on a lower platform, and may in severe cases approach\nthe animal type.\nThe patient to be described, here named Mary Barnes, I call\nA in her normal state. B is the abnormal condition, but as there\nwere several abnormal conditions, I call them B 1 to B 10.\nShe was taken ill at the age of 12\u00a3 with influenza,\nfollowed by meningitis. I watched her closely for about\n4 years, and at intervals since. She was a well-behaved, intelli\ngent child, and of good heredity.\nThe first trace of a new personality occurred at about the\nsixth week of illness, when she was subject to attacks of\ncatalepsy. She then changed both in facial expression and\nin manner, and became childish, clipping her words. She was\nquite ignorant of the meaning of words, and had to be re\neducated in the names of simple objects. She also reversed\ncolours, and wrote backwards ; not \" mirror writing,\" but com\nmencing at the tail of each word. She was usually paralysed\nin the legs. She said she had* no name, but was \" a thing.\"\nI called this substage B 2, and B 2 was a frequent visitor\nfor two or three years.\n\fMAT, 1904. General Meeting. 233\nB 1 was a condition of acute delirium, like mania, with\nintense fear and thirst, craving for oranges. The exhaustion\nwas very great. Once she was thought to be dead, being\npossibly in a trance. The attack occurred first in the third\nweek of her illness, and six or seven times since. They came\nand left with equal suddenness, and the alarming exhaustion\nwould equally disappear when another substage occurred.\nThis was probably an acute brain congestion.\nB 3 had fits of temper. She was childish, but more\neducated than B 2. She came for weeks at a time. Her\nhealth was good, but she was liable to toothache. I once\nremoved a tooth from her under chloroform, and her father then,\nby coaxing and calling her by name, brought back the normal\nA. A knew nothing of the pain or the operation. The late\nDr. Althaus witnessed this most remarkable condition. It\nillustrates the opposite of that stage of hypnotism in which\npain is lulled or not felt.\nAs B 3 she visited the seaside, but was frightened at first,\nand said she had never seen the sea before. As A she had\nconstantly seen the sea and bathed.\nB 4 was deaf and dumb, and only came two or three\ntimes.\nB 5 said she was only three days old, and was absolutely\nignorant of any event previous to the last three days. This\nmight be accounted for as a vaso-motor spasm shutting off\nthe bulk of her conscious existence.\nB 6 was like B 2, but less childish and more intelligent.\nShe learned French, and was the only personality that under\nstood French. She was a constant visitor, and finally, after A\ndisappeared, continues to this day.\nB 7 was the opposite of B 5, for she had an abnormally\nclear memory of the events of her infancy, not incompar\nable to what occurs in the second childhood of senile decay.\nShe remembered when 2J years of age going on a tram to\nsee her father in a hospital. She also remembered an illness\nwhich her mother suffered from when she (Mary Barnes) was\nunder 2 years of age.\nB 8 was a state of confusion, perhaps a post-epileptic state.\nB 9 showed different types of the lower animal instincts\u2014\na tendency to kleptomania and violence.\n\f234 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1904.\nIn these stages one can see the superactivity of the lower\nlayers of the brain, cortex. There is exaggeration of the animal\ninstincts, with a loss of functional activity of the higher\nintelligence.\nB 10 came rather gradually, and lasted ahout three months.\nShe resembled a complete imbecile, with a vacant expressionless\nface and dilated pupils. She was deaf, and quite blind. Her\nmind was an absolute blank, and she was also paralysed in\nthe legs. The dilated pupil suggested brain anaemia or over-\naction of the sympathetic with spasm of the blood vessels.\nBut her psychic visual area was apparently active, for she\ndrew beautifully, even though blind, whereas neither in the\nnormal, nor yet in any other abnormal state, could she draw.\nOne may therefore infer that this was some ancestral relic,\nas Laycock called it, or latent mental talent called into action.\nShe was guided in drawing only by touch, as I proved by\nholding a book between her eyes and the paper. Mr. Tweedy\nkindly examined her eyes and found them normal. She would\nalso copy by touch, feeling written words with the left\nforefinger. During these periods she returned once or twice\nquite suddenly to the normal A, when all unfavourable symptoms\ndisappeared immediately.\nAt times she was so helpless that she could not steer a\ncup or spoon to her mouth. She might drop the food over\nher shoulder. The only way she could manage was to feel\nalong her arm and face till she reached her mouth. Her\nparents could only communicate with her by touching her\nwith the tray or the food.\nShe has now settled down into the B 6 stage, and the\nnormal \" A \" has apparently gone entirely. She is like an\nordinary person of healthy mind, but delicate and with loss\nof memory of all events previous to this B 6 personality, though\nquite able to take her proper place in life.\nProbably there was some slight damage to the brain, caused\nby the influenza toxin, with resulting neurasthenia.\nThe chief points of interest in this case are :\n(1) The ignorance of A with regard to B, and vice versa, and\nthe ignorance of the varying personalities of each other.\n(2) The continuity of each substage. Thus B 3 left\nonce in December, returning in June, and then could\n\fMAT, 1904. General Meeting. . . 235\nnot understand the flowers and long evenings., as to\nher it was still December.\n(3) The facility with which one personality was \" switched\noff\" and another switched on, without apparent rhyme\nor reason.\nI do not regard it as a case of somnambulism, but would\nsuggest that just as the surface of the brain is mapped out into\nfunctional areas, so the brain as a whole may be composed of\ndistricts, each district representing a personality or small ego,\nsome good and some bad.\nThe moral is that we should try to encourage the good\npersonalities. If a bad personality present itself before us, we\ncannot perhaps resist it in the sense of destroying it, for it\nrecurs ; but we may be able to replace it by \" switching on \"\na good personality. But if from any cause we lose control of\nthe \" switch,\" then we become irresponsible and at the mercy\nof the personality, which may be a bad one. The changes in\npersonality may be brought about through spasms in the\n.various cerebral arteries,, causing a diminution in the supply of\nblood to different areas.\nWhen we apply the evidence of such cases as the one just\ndescribed to our daily experience, does it not affect .the question\nof individual responsibility ? Bad air, unwholesome food, and\ndisease work havoc among the children of the poor. Worst\nof all are the effects of drink through the parents. Thus\nmany a child is wrecked on the threshold of his existence.\nHis destined personality may be destroyed in infancy, and he\ngrows up in an abnormal personality of a lower grade. What\nis our duty in dealing with him ?\nDr. K. Jones has called attention to the increasing physical\ndegeneration of our race. This case has some bearing on his\nsubject. Though not a degenerate, it illustrates how the in\nstability of the normal Ego may destroy the original and true\npersonality, leaving other types good or bad. The whole sub\nject requires more extended investigation.\nDR. K. JONES said that he had seen the case described, and\nhad been much struck with the accurate record and careful\nnotes made by Dr. Wilson, whose theory must, he thought, be\naccepted for the present until some more satisfactory one was\nbrought forward.\n\f236 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, IJXM.\nMK. A. F. SHAND suggested that the different stages might\nbe regarded as moods in which one or other emotion was\npredominant rather than as distinct personalities. Thus in one\nstage the emotion of fear and in another that of anger seemed\nto absorb the whole consciousness. The subject, however, gave\nherself different names in different stages as if she regarded\nherself as different persons. He also thought that if Dr.\nWilson's theory that the changes were brought about by the\ncutting off of the blood supply from various regions of the\nbrain was correct, it would have to be explained why there\nwas no atrophy of the brain substance in those regions which\nwere deprived of blood.\nDR. LLOYD TUCKEY said that he had come across five or six\ncases of dual or multiple personality ; the most recent was that\nof an Oxford undergraduate, who disappeared from home and\nafter ten days sent a telegram from Malta asking for money\nto bring him back. He remembered coming to himself in the\nact of knocking a man down at Tunis ; probably the excite\nment had brought him round. Dr. Tuckey had seen Dr.\nWilson's case some years ago, and had tried to hypnotise the\ngirl without success.\nTHE HON. E. FEILDING asked if \" Mary Barnes's \" apparently\nabnormal sense of sight was dependent on touch or if psychic\nvision was present.\nTHE PRESIDENT referred to the case (published in the Pro\nceedings, Vol. IV., p. 230) of the son of a clergyman who was\nsubject for a time to attacks of secondary personality, during\nwhich he did not know his own parents, but imagined they\nwere living in India; he lost the mathematical knowledge he\npossessed, acquiring on the other hand a great increase in his\nmusical capacity. With regard to the extraordinary hyper-\nEeathesia of touch in Mary Barnes's case, he had met with the\nsame phenomenon in the case of a blind and deaf woman\n(Mrs. Croad) whom he had visited at Bristol some years\nago, and who, at the time of his visit, could only be com\nmunicated with through writing on her cheek. She knitted\nin coloured wools, working coloured patterns, and said she\ncould distinguish the colours by touch. She could also\nperceive pictures by touch when concealed by an intervening\nscreen. Apparently she could feel on a surface roughnesses\n\fMAT, 1904. General Meeting. 237\nwhich were only discernible to ordinary eyes through a\nmicroscope.\nDR. WILSON in reply to Mr. Shand's questions said the\nsubject did not originate the names by which she was called\nin her different stages\u2014they were suggested by her parents.\nThe brain-cells of the inactive regions of the brain would not\natrophy on his theory, as according to this the blood supply\nto those regions was not entirely cut off, but only greatly\ndiminished. He thought it probable, however, that the super\nficial \" embryonic \" cells were somewhat damaged, since the\nsubject's memory was much impaired. There was no permanent\nparalysis, but he imagined that there was a spasm of some of the\ncerebral arteries, which only allowed enough blood to circulate\nto keep the areas alive, but not active. The subject's present\ncondition was a fairly satisfactory one ; she had learnt type\nwriting, was now a lady's companion, and much valued in that\ncapacity. During her illness the doctors who tried to hypno\ntise her had not been able to do so, but she occasionally\nshowed susceptibility to suggestion ; e.g. she could sometimes be\nmade to walk after being paralysed, but that might be because\nthe personality happened to be changing just then. In answer\nto Mr. Feilding's question, as to her apparent power in the\nabnormal state of seeing through a screen or by touch, he\nthought that a heightened power of touch called up mental\npictures in her mind and so produced definite visual im\npressions.\nTELEPATHIC EXPERIMENTS WITH DR. RICHARDSON.\nIN the issues of Liyht of December 14th, 1901, and January\nllth, 1902, there appeared accounts of certain experiments\nin telepathy with Dr. R. F. Richardson of Nottingham, in which\nsuccessful results were claimed, and on July 17th, 1903,\nthere was published in the Daily Express, under startling\nheadlines, a report of experiments in \" Long-distance Telepathy \"\nbetween London and Nottingham, the proceedings at the London\nend taking place at the office of the Review of Reviews, under\nthe control of a committee summoned by Mr. W. T. Stead.\nMr. Stead has since, through the medium of an American news\npaper, stated that these experiments have convinced him of the\nreality of long-distance telepathy.\n\f238 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAT, i9w.\nDr. Richardson, having recently invited the S. P. R. to hold\nsome experiments with him, a Committee consisting of Miss\nAlice Johnson, Mr. W. W. Baggally, Lt.-Col. Le Mesurier\nTaylor, and the Hon. E. Feilding, assembled on February 18th\nlast to meet Dr. Richardson and two \" sensitives,\" Mr. and\nMrs. S., who came up from Nottingham for the purpose. It\nwas decided that no long-distance tests should be attempted,\nas experiments between two rooms in the same house were\nmore easily controllable, and if successful would be of almost\nequal interest. Dr. Richardson claims to be able, by means of\na sudden gesture of his arm, accompanied by an effort of the\nwill, to convey an impulse or thrill to a distant sensitive.\nBy means of a code, based on the number of such thrills, an\nintelligent message may be sent, as by the Morse system. He\nclaims that if the two -rooms are connected by an electric bell,\nof which the sounder is in the room with the Committee, the\nsensitive in the other room will be able to notify, by means\nof the bell, the sending of a thrill from the Committee room.\nFurther, that by application of the code, the sensitive will be\nable to determine which, out of a choice of various numbers,\nwords, or objects, has been selected by the Committee. Dr.\nRichardson had prepared a programme of his experiments, to\nwhich the Committee agreed to adhere. This programme com\nprised the following experiments :\n(1) \"Vibratory test,\" wherein the sensitive would notify\nby means of a bell the instant at which a thrill had been\nsent, provided that such thrill should be sent at a moment\nindicated by one of the Committee within a certain limit of\ntime from the commencement of the experiment, the limit\nbeing for the first experiment one minute, for the second two\nminutes, and for the third three minutes.\n(2) \"Time test,\" similar to the above, the sensitive indicating\nby the bell a particular time at which the bell should ring,\nchosen in advance by the Committee.\n(3) \" Number test,\" wherein the choice of one out of five\nnumbers offered to the Committee for selection would be indi\ncated. These numbers were 579, 555, 666, 777, and 888, being\nnumbers in which Dr. Richardson stated he had always practised.\n(4) \" Metal test,\" in which the sensitive would state which\nout of three coins, copper, silver, and gold, had been chosen.\n\fMAT, 1904. Telepathic Experiments ivith Dr. Richardson. 239\n(5) \" Coin Valuation test,\" in which a selection of one out\nof seven coins of various denominations would be notified.\nDr. Eichardson stated that success was almost invariable, and\nthat the truth of his claims would be demonstrated beyond any\nquestion. The experiments were made variously with Dr. Eichard\nson, Mr. S., and Mrs. S., acting in turn as agent and percipient.\nIn view of the small measure of success obtained, the following\nis probably a sufficiently full account of the proceedings :\n(1) Time test, (a) Time chosen, 6.23. No ring till 6.27,\nwhen test was abandoned. Eesult, failure.\n(6) Time chosen, 6.33J. Bell rings at 6.35\u00a3.\nEesult, 2 mins. too late.\n(2) Number test. Number chosen by lot out of five alterna\ntives, 579. Answer, 579. Eesult, correct. It will\nbe noticed that in this test the probability against\nsuccess was 4 to 1.\n(3) Metal test, (a) Metal chosen, out of three alternatives,\ngold. Answer, copper. Eesult, failure.\n(b) Metal chosen, copper. Answer, silver.\nEesult, failure. Here the chances\nagainst success were only 2 to 1.\n(4) Vibratory test (see description above).\n(a) Limit allowed, one minute. Eesult, bell rings\n15\" after signal.\n(b) Limit allowed, two minutes. Eesult, bell rings\n55\" after signal.\n(c) Limit allowed, three minutes. Eesult, bell rings 30\"\ntoo soon, i.e. before the signal was given at all.\n(5) Time test, (a) Bell rings before any time chosen at all.\n(b) Misunderstanding ; no certain result.\n(c) Time chosen, 7.5. Mrs. S., who is acting\nas agent, sends thrill. No answer. Dr.\nE. then says he will try. Eesult, answer\ncomes 1 5\" afterwards.\n(6) Number test. Number chosen by lot, out of 5 alterna\ntives, 555. Answer, 666. Eesult, failure.\n(7) Metal test. Metal chosen, out of 3 alternatives, gold.\nAnswer, gold. Eesult, correct.\n\f240 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

An\nswer, immediate.\n(9) Time test. Time chosen, 7.57J. Answer, 1 minute\nafterwards.\n(10) Number test, (a) Number chosen by lot, out of 7\nalternatives (viz. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9), 3. Answer,\n4. Result, failure.\n(6) Number chosen, 9. Answer, 7.\nEesult, failure. Here the chances\nagainst success are 6 to 1.\n(11) Metal test, (a) Metal chosen, out of 3 alternatives,\ncopper. Answer, Gold. Eesult, failure.\n(&) Metal chosen, copper. Answer, gold.\nEesult, failure.\n(c) Metal chosen, gold. Answer, gold.\nEesult, correct.\n(12) Coin Valuation test, (a) Coin chosen, out of 7 alterna\ntives, a shilling. Answer, silver, half-a-crown.\nEesult, partly correct.\n(6) Coin chosen, a florin. Answer,\ngold. Eesult, failure. The\nchances against complete suc\ncess (i.e. both metal and coin)\nare again 6 to 1.\n(13) Dr. Eichardson then went into the adjoining room\nsaying that he would be able telepathically to\nannounce as soon as one of the Committee had taken\nup one of the coins left on the table. The Com\nmittee deliberately did nothing, in order to test the\neffect of expectation. Two trials were made, but on\neach occasion he notified that a coin had been taken\nup. Eesult, two failures.\nIt will be seen that the above experiments do not show\nsuccessful results in a higher proportion than might be expected\naccording to the laws of chance.\n\fMAT, 1904. Telepathic Experiments tvi.th Dr. Richardson. 241\nIt is true that in a certain number of cases in the vibratory\ntest the bell rang almost coincidentally with the giving of the\nsignal. It also sometimes rang before it and sometimes a\nconsiderable time after. When it rang too late, it was explained\nthat the message sometimes takes a certain time to go through.\nWhen it rang before, it was explained that the percipients were\ntoo nervous or had misunderstood the directions. And when\nit rang coincidentally, success was claimed.\nIn view of the unsatisfactory results of the experiments,\nDr. Eichardson offered to repeat them the following week, and,\nin deference to the Committee's criticism that from such a\nmiscellaneous character of tests, in which the chances of success\nalways varied, no certain conclusions could easily be arrived\nat, he agreed to confine himself to attempting to transmit a\nseries of numbers, from 3 to 23 inclusive. The numbers\nwere placed in a bowl, and one was drawn at random by a\nmember of the Committee. After each experiment the number\nused was put back into the bowl, all the numbers were\nshuffled, and again one was drawn at random from the bowl,\nand so on. The chances against success would thus in each\nexperiment be 19 to 1. On February 25th, a Committee\nconsisting of Mr. J. G. Piddington, Miss Johnson, Mr. Baggally,\nand the Hon. E. Feilding, accordingly assembled to meet Dr.\nEichardson and Mr. and Mrs. S. The following is the result\nof the experiments :\nNo. chosen. Percipient's reply. No. chosen.

It must be pointed\nout, however, that if the vibratory sensations experienced by\nthe percipients have any objective existence outside their own\nimaginations, they should, by means of the code, be applicable\n\f242 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAT, 1904.\nto the transmission of numbers as well as of other things.\nSo far as these experiments justify them in coming to a\nconclusion, the Committee are of opinion that Dr. Eichardsou's\nclaims are not substantiated.\nThere is not the slightest suspicion of any attempt at fraud\nor collusion either on the part of Dr. Eichardson, or of the\ntwo sensitives. Dr. Eichardson, however, exhibited a singular\nillogicality of reasoning, and while it may be that the experi\nments held with the Committee were unusually unsuccessful,\nthey are of opinion that the true explanation of his claims\nwill be found in chance coincidences, combined with the\ninsufficient attention paid by him to the frequently imaginative\ncharacter of sensations felt by percipients (which, as the Com\nmittee found, could easily be produced in them by expectation)\nand the absence of a consistent and methodical way of con\nducting his experiments.\nThe Committee express their thanks to Dr. Eichardson and to\nMr. and Mrs. S. for the time and trouble they have expended in\naffording the Society an opportunity of experimenting with them.\nW.

T.\nPEOFESSOE NEWCOMB ON \"THE GEOEGIA MAGNET.\"\nA COPY of the January Journal, containing an article on the\nreferences in Professor Simon Newcomb's Reminiscences of an\nAstronomer to the performances of the \" little Georgia Magnet,\"\nhaving been sent by Dr. Hodgson to Professor Newcomb, he\n\fMAT, 1904. Professor Newcomb on \" The Georgia Magnet.\" 243\nwrote in reply the following letter, which Dr. Hodgson sends\nus:\u2014\nWASHINGTON, February 1, 1904.\nDEAR MR. HODGSON,\nI am much obliged to you for the pamphlets you\nsend me, containing a letter from Sir Oliver Lodge to the effect\nthat a passage in my Reminiscences of an Astronomer has led to the\n\"natural inference that the late F. W H. Myers and the Society\nfor Psychical Research were misled into supposing that the ingenious\nmechanical tricks of a person called by her exploiters 'the little\nGeorgia Magnet,' some years ago were attributable to supernormal\npower; and that they are publishing this inference as if it were\ntrue.\"\nBy what logical process such an inference can be drawn is beyond\nmy power to conceive. The account which I give of my experience\nwith Miss Lula Hurst in 1884 has no mention of nor allusion to\neither Mr. Myers or the Society of Psychical Kesearch, unless you\nregard my fixing the date as shortly after Professor Fitzgerald's\nvisit to this country to constitute such an allusion. Even psychical\nresearch is not mentioned in the account, except to exclude it by\nthe remark \"a wonder as great as anything recorded in the annals\nof psychical research or spiritualism, etc.,\" my meaning being that\nhere was something which, lying quite outside the realm of psychical\nresearch or spiritualism, being purely mechanical, was as wonderful\nas if it had been within that realm. The only gentlemen to whom\nI alluded as being in any way misled or interested in the matter\nwere some Washington scientific men who, being invited to see the\nperformance, thought it something very wonderful.\nWhether the Mrs. Abbott, whose performances in England came\noff several years later, and of whom I hear now for the first time,\nwas Miss Lula Hurst, 1 have no means of knowing. There were\ncertainly great resemblances between the two performances. But\nas I remember Miss Hurst, she was tall, broad-shouldered and muscular,\nwhile Mrs. Abbott is described as short, small and frail in appearance.\nMoreover, a newspaper paragraph, which has appeared some time in the\ninterval, stated that Miss Hurst had lost her supposed wonderful powers.\nTo recapitulate : how an account of a single performance in\nWashington City, before even the American Society for Psychical\nResearch was organised, and when the British Society was almost\nunknown among us, without any allusion to either Society, or bringing\nin the names of any one connected with the British Society, except\nin the way that I have mentioned, could have led to the inference\nthat I was reflecting on Mr. Myers of the British Society, etc., etc.,\nis beyond my comprehension.\nWill you kindly send this letter to the Society with authority to\nmake any use of it that will correct the impression in question.\nS. NEWCOMB.\nP.S.\u2014The account in Reminiscences is condensed from a more\ndetailed one in Science, Old Series, Vol. V., pp. 106-108 (1885).\n\f244 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

The receipt of\nanother contribution of a guinea from a Member who desired\nto remain anonymous was also announced.\nPPJVATE MEETING FOR MEMBERS AND\nASSOCIATES.\nTHE seventh of the series of private meetings for Members\nand Associates only was held in the large Hall at 20\nHanover Square, London, W., on Monday, May 9th, 1904,\nat 4.15 p.m.; the President, Professor W. F. Barrett, in the\nchair.\nMRS. A. W. VERRALL read a paper on \" Experiments in\nMotor Automatism,\" of which the following is an abstract :\nTable tilting was the method employed in the experiments\ndescribed, which took place during August and September,\n1903. A complete record of the sittings was made at the\ntime by Mrs. Verrall, who was present. In all the sixteen\nsittings Miss H. de G. Verrall acted as automatist ; in eleven\nsittings the other automatist was the Rev. M. A. Bayfield, a\n\f248 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, I<KM.\nmember of the S.l'.K. The table used was a small but\nheavy oak table on four legs ; the usual code was adopted,\nand the tilts were obtained by the table rising on two legs\nand bringing the other two down on the floor, the hands of\nboth sitters resting upon the table.\nThe answers to questions and sentences spontaneously pro\nduced were very various, and largely consisted of long\nconsecutive sentences in English, Latin and Greek, prose and\nverse, claiming to be quotations unknown to the sitters, and\ncapable of verification. These three languages were known\nto both sitters. English and Latin were used indifferently\nas a medium of communication between \" the table \" and the\nsitters, the transition from one to the other being unex\npected and inexplicable, but serving to prevent the sitters\nfrom following what was tilted as easily as if one language\nhad been regularly used. On one occasion what purported\nto be Finnish was given, with a translation, this language\nbeing unknown to all the persons present; but when Spanish\nwas asked for, that being known to one of the sitters, mere\nrubbish was obtained, and no translation offered.\nOn the first occasion, and only then, was there any\nattempt at personification on the part of the table. Asked\nwho had given some names and addresses, which were the\nfirst words obtained, it said \" I,\" and gave its name as\n\" Wilhelm.\" It carried out the suggestion of the name by\na remark later on in German ; the names and addresses\noriginally given turned out to be incorrect, and this was the\nlast of \" Wilhelm.\" No further personification was made.\nAt the next sitting \" the table,\" after saying that it was\nnot the subliminal consciousness of either sitter nor a dis\nembodied spirit, claimed to be the \" sub. of both \" ; on a later\noccasion, after saying that it did not know how it received\nimpressions, it added : \" Thoughts fly, that is how I know ;\nI am the recipient of world films.\"\nFrom experiments made and observations recorded, it was\nclear that though Miss Verrall was an important factor in all\nthe sittings, she was by no means the sole factor; the results\nwere affected by the personality of the other sitter ; e.g.\nreferences were made to things in the mind of the other\nsitter, and not known to Miss Verrall, and tricks of spelling\n\fJCNE, 1904. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 249\nof the second sitter were reproduced. On one occasion the\ntable seemed to present in a confused fashion a thought that\nhad been in the mind of one of the tilters just before the\ntilting, though it did not reproduce it directly ; but generally\nspeaking no connexion could be traced between the thoughts\nof the tilters and the results obtained.\nIn the whole series of sixteen sittings five instances of\napparent telepathy occurred, information being given which\nwas known to some other person in the room or house, but\nnot to the tilters ; and there were two instances where\nstatements subsequently found to be correct were made, con\nveying information unknown to any one in the neighbourhood,\nand therefore seeming to be explicable rather by clairvoyance\nthan by telepathy. These instances were described in detail,\nthe most interesting being as follows : After undertaking to\ngive a quotation unknown to both tilters and capable of sub\nsequent verification, and then selecting the language (Greek)\nand the author (Pausanias), the table reproduced a Greek\nsentence of twenty-three words, followed without break by the\nwords in English \" end going.\" The meaning of the supposed\nextract is : \" Strangers are rioting in all the mountains, for\nthey deserve punishment. Socrates says that strangers could\nnot enter into the city after the sun had set.\" The sentence\nfalls into two parts, the language and phraseology of the first\npart being that of the Epic, while that of the latter part is\nthe ordinary idiom of prose, the difference of style being em\nphasised by the use of different forms for the word \" strangers \"\n(xeinoi and .rcnoi), which occurs in both parts of the sentence.\nIn reply to questions, the table gave as the exact reference\nPausanias, book vi., chap. 17; but on investigation it\nappeared, as was expected from acquaintance with Pausauias,\nthat nothing like the passage in question was contained in\nPausanias, vi., 17.\nThe next day the table gave the name of the author of\nthe quotation as Heliodorus, and again, later on, it repeated\nthat Heliodorus was the author, and corrected the reference\nfrom vi., 17 to vi., 12. A copy of Heliodoms, obtained on\na librarian's order from the University library, was consulted,\nand it appeared that book vi., chap. 12, contains the account\nof the arrival of a young man and a maiden outside a town\n\f250 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNK, ISKH.\nabout sunset. They speak to an old woman there, and after\na time, on proposing to enter the town, are told that as\nstrangers they cannot enter at that hour, and accordingly\nthey have to wait to go into the city till the next morning.\nThe resemblance between the incident described in Heliodorus,\nvi., 12, and the latter half of the sentence given by the\ntable is undeniable, and the incident seems too definite for\nthe resemblance to be ascribed to accident. Heliodorus, a\nlate writer, is not necessarily known to students of the\nclassics, and neither of the tilters is believed to have read\nhis novel. It is certain that Miss Verrall had no opportu\nnity of doing so, and Mr. Bayfield, if he ever saw the passage,\nmust have done so by accident some thirty years ago. The\nrecovery from his memory of the substance, but not the\nwords, of the incident, with the exact reference, would seem\nnot easily paralleled as an instance of revived memory. No\ntheory to explain this curious incident is suggested. Not\nthe least puzzling part of it is the appearance of the long\nGreek statement falling naturally into two parts, and the\nsubsequent verification of the latter half only ; no efforts were\nable to obtain any clue to the rest of the sentence.\nOn the whole, the experience of this series of sittings led\nthe sitters to the conclusion that better results were obtained\nfrom encouraging the \" table \" to tilt out sentences with as\nlittle questioning on the part of the sitters as possible ; the\n\" table \" was ready enough to answer questions, but the\nanswers were more fluent than correct.\nAt the close of the paper tea was served, after which\nthere was a discussion.\nMiss GRIGNON, referring to the passage quoted from\nHeliodorus, which was thought to be unknown to either of the\nsitters, asked whether it was not possible that this might be\nquoted in some book on some totally different subject, where\none of the sitters might have come across it.\nMR. FEILDING inquired as to the type of quotation given\nspontaneously, and also whether the original matter given was\nof any literary interest.\nSIR LAWRENCE JONES asked whether the sitters had received\nany personal messages, or whether they had been given names\nor soubriquets by the table.\n\fJUNK, 1904.

VEKKALL, in reply, said that\u2014\n(1) With regard to the passage from Heliodorus, they had\nnot been able to discover any passages in other books quoted\nfrom Heliodorus except a reference to a scene of incanta\ntion, which followed soon after the passage quoted by the table,\nbut it was, of course, impossible to say that none existed.\n(2) The quotations given were in Latin, English, or Greek.\nThere were some lines of Latin verse, but the original matter\nwas not beyond what might have been produced, she thought,\nby the sitters themselves.\n(3) The table had given no personal messages, and the\nsitters had not been given names or soubriquets.\nIn reply to further questions, MRS. YERRALL said that the\nmethod used had been that of spelling out the alphabet,\nthe right letters being indicated by the cessation of the move\nment. The letters were not always spoken aloud, and on one\noccasion, when, not having her hands on the table, she had\nrepeated them to herself, a long Latin sentence had been\ncorrectly given. The sitters had not, on any of these occa\nsions, obtained movements without contact, though the move\nments of the table were often more violent than they would\nhave \u2022 expected to produce themselves. It tilted occasionally\nwith extreme rapidity, and sometimes seemed to be trying to\nget into the sitters' laps. No physical phenomena had been\nobtained, though the table had expressed its ability to pro\nduce them. On one occasion, having said that it would\nmove a pencil on another table some little distance away, it\nproduced the desired result by moving violently and hitting\nMrs. Verrall's foot (she being on this occasion one of the tillers),\nwhich caused her to knock against the table on which the\npencil lay, and start it rolling, whereupon the table declared\nits attempt to be a success.\nMuch of the matter given was nonsensical, and sometimes\nnames and addresses were given which were entirely incorrect,\nand known to be so at the time.\nThe intelligence of the table did not seem to correspond with\nthe intelligence of the sitters, and in replying to questions\nasked it often answered what was actually said rather than\nwhat was meant.\nTHE PRESIDENT, commenting on the paper, said that he\n\f252 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNK, 1904.\nthought it had an added value in the admirable method of in\nvestigation followed by Mrs. Verrall. It was open to all Members\nof the Society to carry out experiments on similar lines, and he\nwould urge them to do so, and to record their results, as\nevery genuine record of this kind might turn out to be of\nvalue. Mrs. Verrall's paper seemed to illustrate the import\nance of leaving the production of these phenomena to the\nsubliminal self, instead of trying to interfere with or control\nthem through the conscious self. Finally he would urge on\nexperimenters not to be alarmed at the results obtained, nor\nto set them down either to electricity or the devil\u2014two\nnot uncommon methods of explaining such phenomena, neither\nof which, he need hardly say, would be found able to account\nfor the facts observed.\nCORRECTION.\nWE are sometimes accused of over great caution in our treat\nment of the reports of apparently supernormal phenomena\nthat reach us, of an excessive and unnecessary desire to\nobtain corroboration of the statements of obviously respectable\npersons, and of abstaining from the publication of cases as\nlong as there is any reasonable probability of obtaining more\nevidence. It is true that publication is sometimes postponed\nfor several months\u2014occasionally even for two or three years\u2014\non account of the time spent in getting answers to our en\nquiries about cases. But that these precautions are generally\ndesirable is shown by the following instance, in which they\nwere partially relaxed.\nIn the Journal for February, 1904, p. 187, was printed\nan account of an apparition seen by Mr. J. Osborne. The\naccount itself was uncorroborated, but there was unusually\nstrong evidence of the writer's bona fides, as vouched for by\nthe County Magistrate who contributed the case, and a\nMember of our Council who interviewed the percipient.\nWe have since had further opportunities of investigating\nthe account, which is now shown to be partially incorrect,\nthe accident with which the apparition was supposed to be\nassociated having happened many years earlier than the per\ncipient stated, and not in the place described by him.\nWe feel bound to print this correction, though we have\n\fJUNE, 1904. Correction. 253\nno doubt that Mr. Osborne, in giving his account, stated\nwhat he fully believed at the time to be true. It appears\nthat, with every intention of being accurate, he made the\ncommon mistake of exaggerating in recollection the degree of\ncoincidence between his experience and the event with which\nhe believed it to be related.\nMr. Osborne himself wrote to us on February 8th, 1904,\nas follows :\u2014\nIn reply to yours of the 4th I beg to say that, as near as I can\nfix, the date you ask for [i.e. the date when he saw the apparition]\nis the end of March or beginning of April, 1895.\nThe accident must have happened just before, as the woman I\nwas staying with knew the man from my description of him, and\nthen suddenly remembered that he had been killed.\nI did not trouble to make any enquiry, but for a good time after\nfelt considerably unnerved. JAMES OSBORNE.\nP.S.\u2014I knew nothing at all of the affair; was just there for a\nfew days on business, a perfect stranger, knowing no one whatever.\nWe had at first understood the letters of Mr. K. (from\nwhom we obtained the case) to imply that he himself had\nan independent knowledge of the accident, but he afterwards\ntold us that this was not so, and gave us the name of the\nwoman with whom Mr. Osborne lodged on the occasion.\nOne of our members, Mr. T. H. Davis, then kindly under\ntook to visit this woman and reported to us on February 21st,\n1904, as follows:\nI visited Wolverton on Friday, 19th inst\nFrom the directions I gathered that Mrs. Merritt would be living\nsomewhere between Wolverton station and Newport Pagnell ; 1\ntherefore made that district the locality for my first enquiries, but\nwithout success. I was unable to find any one of that name who\nhad lived there within the memory of any of those of whom I\nmade enquiry. I decided upon staying the night, and pursuing my\nenquiries in the other direction on the following day.\nWolverton is a railway town ; its chief and practically only in\ndustry is that of railway carriage building for the L. & N. W.\nEailway Company. I therefore made enquiry among men connected\nwith the carriage works, and ultimately succeeded in tracing Mrs.\nMerritt. Mrs. Merritt's address is 578 Young Street, Wolverton ; has\nlived in the same house over 20 years, and in and about Wolverton over\n\f254 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNK, ISKM.\n40 years. Young Street is in Wolverton, and on the Wolverton side\nof the station, Newport Pagnell being in the opposite direction. It is\nwithin five minutes' walk of the station, but stands back from the main\nroad at right angles some 200 yards, the market house intervening.\nMrs. Merritt appears a good witness, an intelligent woman some\nwhere about 60 years of age, rather under than over. She remembers\nMr. Osborne perfectly, volunteering the information that he was a\npainter from Oxford ; he lodged with her for (probably) two or three\nweeks, some years ago, but unable to say exact year. Mrs. Merritt\nknows nothing whatever of the story; she made no such remark to\nMr. Osborne, neither did she ever hear of any such accident, and\nhad one occurred she would be sure to have heard of it. She\nhas heard a story to the effect that very many years ago a\nman named Eichard Ratclifl'e, a farmer, was killed by a horse in a\nhay-field, and that people used to say his ghost had been seen near\nthe locality, some miles away from Wolverton.\n(I could obtain no other corroboration of this story.)\nSome months after Mr. Osborne had lived with her he came again :\nthis would, she thinks, be either in October or November of the same\nyear, and as she, Mrs. Merritt, could not accommodate him on that\noccasion, she sent him across the street to a neighbour, Mrs. Newbold.\nMr. Osborne had gone to Wolverton to do some work at the\nstation in connection with the \"Sunlight soap\" advertisements.\nI called upon Mrs. Newbold at No. 631 Young Street. Mrs. New-\nbold is somewhat older than Mrs. Merritt, but a woman of intel\nligence and clear faculties ; she also remembered Mr. Osborne\nperfectly, and, like Mrs. Merritt, volunteered the information that\nhe was a painter from Oxford.\nMr. Osborne, who was accompanied by his son, a youth named\nRonald, lodged with Mrs. Newbold one night\u2014it is some years\nsince, she cannot say how many, perhaps eight years or so ; he had\nsome painting work to do at the station, something to do with\n\" Sunlight soap.\" She knows nothing whatever of the story, neither\ndid she ever hear of any such accident having occurred.\nMrs. Newbold has lived in Wolverton 39 years, 27 of which have\nbeen passed in her present house.\nYoung Street appears to be one of many similar streets of small\nhouses built by the L. & N. W. Railway Company for the accom\nmodation of their workmen and their families.\nI made enquiries of several people in Wolverton, but none had\never heard of the supposed accident. T. H. DAVIS.\n\fJUNK, 1904. Gwrection. 255\nWriting a few days later, Mr. Davis adds :\n... I think it possible the case is explicable somewhat on the\nlines you indicate [i.e. on the hypothesis of some illusion of memory].\nMemory has, in my opinion, also played Mr. Osborne false in regard\nto the locale of the hallucination, unless before proceeding straight\nto his lodgings from the station, as implied in his account, he took\na walk in the opposite direction.\nAnd, probably, again in respect to the time, i.e. there would\nappear to be some confusion as to whether it occurred on the\noccasion of his first prolonged visit to \\Volverton, or that of his\nsecond and much shorter one ; if the latter, then on that occasion\nMrs. Newbold would be his landlady. . . .\nMr. Davis afterwards wrote to Mr. Osborne, asking for\nan interview, in the hope of being able to clear up the dis\ncrepancies in the various accounts, but Mr. Osborne refused\nto see him or to give any further information in the affair.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n[The Editor is not responsible for ojrinions ejyyresscd by\nCorrespondents.]\nON THE TYPES OF PHENOMENA DISPLAYED IN MRS. THOMPSON'S\nTRANCE.\nTo the Editor of the\nJOURNAL OF THK SOCIETY FOK PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nNEW YORK, February 12th, 1904.\nMr. Piddington's paper on the \" Types of Phenomena displayed\nin Mrs. Thompson's Trance\" has been one of unusual interest to\nme for such facts as help to throw light upon the complications\nof the problem with which psychic research has to deal. But it\nhas one serious defect for the scientific psychologist, and this is\nthe absence of detailed record of matter that is not supernormal.\nThe critical student really obtains no adequate conception of non\nsensical matter at the sittings in such accounts as are published.\nIt is well to have the paper that Mr. Piddington has written.\nThis should not be omitted, but I think the Report would have\nbeen infinitely better if we had been given a much more detailed\nrecord of the sittings. I do not believe that we shall ever get\nat the foundations of this problem until this is done. After all\n\f256 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUSK, i!K)4.\nthe evidence of the supernormal that has been published, it is\nexceedingly important to have with it the mass of irrelevant and\nnonsensical matter that is found associated with this supernormal. I\nam of the opinion that many of the perplexities which Mr. Piddington\nhad to encounter in his study of the case would appear less\ntroublesome, if the psychologist could have had a stenographic\naccount of absolutely all that was said and done. Sometimes the\nnonsense is more valuable to the psychologist than the sense and\nthe supernormal. I have generally found this to be the case.\nWe shall never understand the place of secondary personality and\nsubliminal action until we get these details.\nToo many inquirers have lost the true scientific interest in\nsecondary personality in the presence of a hope of supernormal\nphenomena, when the whole history of our work shows that the\nmajority of its results has been associated with much chaff, and\nthat the chaff shows the conditions in which we have to conduct\nour investigations. This is so true that I have about come to\nthe conclusion that I shall pay very little attention to any dis\ncussions that are not accompanied by detailed records. The\ncomplications of subconscious action, mental and neural, are so\ngreat and are so associated with the glimpses of the supernormal\nthat we get now and then, that we need to know them in order\nto protect both ourselves and the public from illusion as to meaning\nof the supernormal itself.\nThe illustration of this need will be found in what Mr. Pidding\nton says regarding the phenomena that have suggested to him his\nfrequent comparison of Mrs. Thompson's trance with Mrs. Piper's.\nMr. Piddington has observed both the resemblances and the\ndifferences between the two, but he has not remarked the true\nsignificance of the differences. The general conception of the\n\" trance \" has prevented the discovery of that meaning. So far\nas I can see, Mr. Piddington seems to assume that the \" trance \"\nin each case is of the same type and the differences are in the\ncontents of what is said and recorded. These differences of subject\nmatter have been noted, and they consist of evident interpenetra-\ntion of normal and abnormal mental processes and material. Mr.\nPiddington has often remarked the intromission into the \" trance \"\nutterances of Mrs. Thompson of facts known to her normal or\nsupraliminal consciousness, a phenomenon quite well known in\nsecondary personality. Now it is the bearing of this fact on the\nreal nature of the \" trance \" that ought to have been observed,\nand all that occurred in connection with events ought to have\n\fJUNE, 190-4. Comespondeiice. 257\nbeen recorded and published. Here is the point where all the\nnonsense ought to have been remarked and cherished as a precious\njewel. Here is where the whole difference between the cases of\nMrs. Thompson and Mrs. Piper is to be found. It is apparent\nto me that Mrs. Thompson's \"trance\" is often, perhaps mainly,\nidentical with Mrs. Piper's \" subliminal I,\" as denominated by Dr.\nHodgson, and that it is in any case fundamentally different from\nthat of the Piper record. It is not easy to determine the point\nwhere \" subliminal I \" passes into \" subliminal II,\" or rice rerta,\nbut the characteristic difference between them is the fact that the\nmatter \"communicated\" in \"subliminal II\" is of the automatic\ntype and represents the casual admission of thoughts and \" messages \"\non the \" other side.\" \" Subliminal I \" represents Mrs. Piper in\nthe mental attitude of an observer of events on the \"other\nside \" with the retention more or less of her own individuality,\nand the occasional intromission of secondary personality elements\nof her normal experience or even of a sensory impression at the\ntime, as I remember once she asked, as she came out of the\ntrance, if we heard that whistle, a postman's whistle having just\nblown. But \" subliminal I \" represents the transitional stage of\nthe trance through secondary personality, and usually just far\nenough away to escape sensory consciousness of the ordinary kind\nand individuality enough to escape the automatic condition and\nrapport with the transcendental world, so to speak.\nNow it seems to me that Mrs. Thompson's \"trance\" fluctuates\nbetween two conditions, one intermediate between the normal and\nMrs. Piper's \"subliminal I,\" and the other between Mrs. Piper's\n\"subliminal I\" and \"subliminal II,\" the latter representing the\noccasional access of an automatic condition to the influences in\nvolving supernormal knowledge. Here is where it would have been\nmost important to have had a full record of what was said and\ndone by Mrs. Thompson. It is true that we have a detailed\nrecord of the case published in the Proceedings (Vol. XVII.), but\nMr. Piddington has in the present paper of his called attention\nto the fact that certain portions of that record were omitted,\nbecause they would \"have interrupted and confused the main\nnarrative.\" But I must contend that their omission only confuses\nthe psychologist in getting a correct conception of what actually\nwent on at the time, and though it may not be necessary to the\n\" main narrative \" materially to have omitted what has now been\nrescued, the omission suggests that at least one important resemblance\nto the Piper sittings was not noticed at the time, or at least not\n\f258 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1904.\nclearly made known. This resemblance is in the fact of irrelevant\n\" messages,\" in so far as the sitter is concerned at the time, but\nstill relevant to some previous sitter. This has been very common\nin the Piper record, especially in the Phinuit days. This omission,\nnow redeemed by Mr. Piddington's act of penitence, suggests that\nmuch may have been omitted that would throw light on the\nproblem of the \" trance \" in the case. Whether this is the case\nor not is not made clear in either Report on Mrs. Thompson.\nIt may have been impossible under the circumstances to have\ntaken the desired record. I am not contending here that it was\ninexcusable, or that the matter was evidently there for record,\nbut only that we have no evidence that the real problem was\nsufficiently appreciated to keep on the look out for the facts which\nI should like to have known, and the disposition to suppress parts\nof the record not bearing upon the \" main narrative \" rather shows\na tendency to neglect what I must regard as one of the most\nimportant parts of the whole question. What I would like to\nknow is the actual nonsense that was uttered at various times.\nI know the difficulties in getting this when we cannot have a\nrapid stenographer present, as we have to note first the facts\npossibly bearing upon the supernormal, and this was recognised in\nthe first Report on the case (Vol. XVII., p. 88). But whatever\nthe difficulties of making the record what it should be, there is\nno harm in calling attention to a defect in it and to the great\nimportance now of paying careful attention to the nonsense of\nsuch cases, especially as this nonsense will be the key to the\nnature of the trance and will show the psychological processes\ninvolved in the study of mediumistic phenomena. I feel confident\nthat, if they had been remarked in this instance, we should under\nstand Mrs. Thompson's case much better and be able to present\na tolerable theory why the subject matter of the \"communications\"\nis so different from the peculiar character of Mrs. Piper's \" messages.\"\nThere is all through Mrs. Thompson's case evidence of greater\ndifficulty in getting access to the kind of supernormal information\nshown in Mrs. Piper's later trances under the Imperator regime.\nI have never had the importance of nonsensical \" messages \" so\nemphasised as I feel them in this case. The Smead Case which\nI have been investigating makes this contention clear. Its chief value\nlies in its non-evidential matter and its borderland character, more\nremoved from the normal consciousness than Mrs. Thompson and\nwith less access to supernormal information than Mrs. Thompson,\nor at least to evidentially supernormal knowledge.\n\fJUNK, 1904. Correspondence, 259\nI think the various phases and phenomena of secondary personality\nare going to be, in the future of psychical research, quite as im\nportant as, perhaps more important than, the fact of the supernormal.\nIf this be true, everything that abnormal psychology can supply us\nwith must be observed with care equal to that applied to other\nphenomena. If the cases are those of automatic writing, we must\nbe careful to note every mechanical feature of the process and all\npauses, scrawls, and motor phenomena accessible to observation and\nsuch as are discoverable only by the sphygmograph and other instru\nments. I have now under my observation a case of subliminal\naction which varies somewhat with the normal and the anaemic\ncondition of the hand. When that shows a normal circulation of\nthe blood the writing is one thing, and when it is anaemic the\nwriting is often another, though the variations are not wholly\ndependent upon this feature of the case. But what we know of\nphysiology throws light upon the difficulties of the problem, and\nthat is now our main task in our understanding of the super\nnormal. The psychological nature of the \" messages \" will show\nwhat our difficulties are in the influence of secondary personality\nand its limitations in the access to what transcends it. In the\nstudy of this we must know everything that occurs, and especially\nthe nonsense. Nothing but the most detailed record will supply\nour wants, and general discussion and narration of supernormal\nincidents will avail nothing to clear up our difficulties in such\ncases. What was wanted in the case of Mrs. Thompson was the\npublication of the details in the original Report, and then such\ndiscussion as we now have from Mr. Piddington, and if that\ndetailed record had been more complete than it apparently is, so\nmuch the better for science, especially on the fundamental question\nof the nature of the \"trance\" and its- comparison with that of\nMrs. Piper, and I must say that this is now one of our most\nimportant tasks. JAMES H. HYSLOP.\nI have to thank Professor Hyslop for sending me, in the first\ninstance, his letter intended for the Journal, and I avail myself of\nthe opportunity thus afforded to append my reply.\nProfessor Hyslop's whole criticism is, I think, founded on a mis\nconception of the object which I had in view in writing my paper,\nand his adverse comments are due to his assuming that I was attacking\ncertain psychological problems which interest him, but which for the\nimmediate purposes of my paper I did not allow to interest me. I\ndeliberately confined myself, as Professor Hyslop will see if he will\n\f260 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNK, 1904.\nrefer to pp. 111-112, to an attempt to classify the phenomena iu\norder to test their consistency, and I deliberately refrained from\ndiscussing the source of the communications, and only incidentally\ndid I discuss the ' evidential ' value of certain of the incidents\nnarrated. Whatever view may be taken of Mrs. Thompson's trance\nutterances, it is not open to question that they approximate more\nnearly to the evidential standard of Mrs. Piper's than those of almost\nany other medium. If, then, Dr. Hodgson is right in suspecting the\ngenuineness of Mrs. Thompson's trance, grave doubt must fall on\nMrs. Piper's. Hence it seemed to me important to debate this single\nquestion : Are Mrs. Thompson's phenomena spontaneous or spurious ?\nAnd this, I thought, might be done by trying to test them by classi\nfication, and by excluding other issues.\nWith regard to other points raised by Professor Hyslop, I would\nremark that :\u2014\n(1) The critical student would obtain from my paper a more\nthan adequate conception of the proportion of nonsensical\nmatter contained in Mrs. Thompson's trance utterances.\n(2) Except where noted, the records are practically verbatim ;\nby which I mean that only the most trifling words or\nrepetitions of phrases may here and there have been lost.\n(3) Far from assuming that \"the trance in each case [i.e. of\nMrs. Piper and Mrs. Thompson] is of the same type and\nthe differences are in the contents of what is said and\nrecorded,\" I assume, if not the precise contrary, at least\nsomething not far removed from it. (v. p. 105.)\n(4) I entirely dissent from Professor Hyslop's opinion that a\nfull verbatim report of \" nonsense \" is either essential or\ndesirable. In my view a selection of nonsense suffices.\nWhere evidence of supernormal faculty is sought, I, of\ncourse, agree that a verbatim record and report is essential.\n(5) Professor Hyslop has credited me with an \"act of peni\ntence \" of which I am not guilty\u2014I mean, which I have\nnot performed.\n(6) I am probably quite as much interested in, and quite as\nsensible of the value of, the \" nonsense \" in trance-utterances\nas Professor Hyslop ; but before seeking to extract psycho\nlogical lessons from the nonsense, I prefer first to satisfy\nmyself that the trance-phenomena are not spurious. I\nagree with Professor Hyslop in disbelieving that \"we shall\never get at the foundations of this problem \" unless the\nnonsense as well as the sense receives careful study. But\nI was not trying to \"get at the foundations of this problem.\"\nPerhaps 500 or 5000 years hence the time may be ripe\nfor making an effort to get at these foundations.\nJ. G.

ERNEST DUXBAR read a paper on \" The Light thrown on\nPsychological Processes by the Action of Drugs.\" He pointed\nout the necessity for conducting experiments of this kind with\nthe utmost care. A knowledge of the conditions at the com\nmencement of the experiment was essential, and a careful\nanalysis of the stages of the experiment was equally necessary.\nThe problem is to find out whether the changes in con\nsciousness are radical and complete, or whether there is not\nsome element of an unchangeable nature to be found both in\nthe normal and in the abnormal condition. The simplest effect\nof all substances of this kind is the feeling that there is some\ndifference between the relationship the individual then bears to\nhis environment and his normal relationship to it.\nUnder alcohol, for instance, the individual is perfectly con\nscious of this difference. There is undoubtedly a depression of\nsensation commencing with touch sensations, then affecting\nhearing, then smell and taste, and, lastly, sight.\nThe first change is found in a slight loss of appreciation of\nthe significance of these sensations ; finally there is a depression\nof the senses themselves. The curious fact that keeps em\nphasising itself in all experiments of a similar nature is that,\nup to the time the individual loses all touch with his environ\nment, the intelligence appears to grasp the meaning of the situa\ntion so well that, in the early stages at least, every effort is made\nto gain control again. An experiment with ether was instanced\nto show that, even after effects of a profound nature had been\n\f264 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1004.\ninduced, the individual was still sufficiently sensible to reason\nlogically, and to grasp the entire significance of the situation.\nIt was pointed out that the changes in the feelings of the\nperson taking these substances had a physical parallel, and that\nthere were many physiological facts to indicate that in some\nrespects the psychical condition was closely connected with\nphysical changes in the cerebrum.\nAn exception to this was, however, indicated by the\napparent supremacy of the intelligence, which persists up to\na very extreme stage of narcotisation. Another significant\nfact was that even after a long anaesthesia, in which profound\nphysical changes must have been produced, the patient could\ntake up the thread of his intelligence just where he had left\noff, and when the effects of the anaesthetic had passed\noff, the integrity of the intelligence remained unaltered.\nThe effects of Indian hemp were next referred to, and a\ndescription by Dr. Marshall, of Cambridge, was quoted in full\nfrom Clifford Allbutt's System of Medicine. Mr. Dunbar\nreferred to his own experience with this drug, which\ncorresponded more or less exactly with that of Dr. Marshall.\nThe alteration of the time-sense was the most prominent\nfeature of Cannabis Indica intoxication, due apparently to a\ntemporary paresis of memory.\nThe loss of the sense of personal identity was quoted as\nanother striking symptom in this condition, and could be\nlogically explained in the same way as the other effect.\nEven the tendency towards unmeaning laughter might be\nsimilarly explained, for, as Sully points out in his Psychology,\nthe appreciation of the humorous lies in a wilful neglect of\nsome part of the mental picture,\u2014an apparent contradiction,\narising from the fact that the individual refuses to exercise\nhis memory to grasp the entire situation. Under Indian\nhemp this memory-paresis is inevitable, and hence, for a time\nat least, all things appear ludicrous and ridiculous.\nMr. Dunbar went on to describe the effects of ether, and\npointed out that Sir William Ramsay's experience, an account\nof which had been read before the Society ten years ago,1\nwas similar to that of several who had tried the drug. The\naction up to a certain stage closely resembled that of alcohol.\n1 See Proceedings S.P.R. Vol. IX., p. 236.\n\fJCT.Y, 1904. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 265\nAfter the first effects of ether have passed off1, there cornea a\ntime of profound intellectual stimulation, during which the mind\nreasons with an astonishing rapidity, choosing, in some individuals,\ntranscendental lines, and, as the intoxication progresses, appearing\nto solve, once and for all, the mystery of the universe.\nAs against this experience, chloroform produces in many\nindividuals a very different effect, there being far less stimulation\nand a much more rapid subsequent depression.\nSubstances resembling chloroform in this respect are\u2014\nBenzene, ethyl bromide, ethyl iodide, carbon bisulphide, carbon\ntetrachloride, and amylene. A noteworthy fact in connection\nwith these substances is that, without exception, they are all\nexcellent solvents of fat, and considering the prevalence of fat\nand such like substances in the nervous system, there might\nconceivably be a connection between this chemical action and\ntheir effect on the nervous system.\nIn closing, Mr. Dunbar pointed out how exceedingly difficult\nit was to draw conclusions from experiments with drugs. The\nmajority of people had a healthy repugnance to dosing themselves\nwith substances of this kind, even for scientific purposes, but he\nthought that a careful and systematic study of the effects of drugs\non different individuals should of necessity yield positive results.\nTHE CHAIRMAN remarked that the paper would, he thought,\nhave been welcomed by Mr. Myers, since the view taken\nby Mr. Dunbar in regard to the unimpaired state of the in\ndividual's intelligence under experiments of this nature was an\ninteresting illustration of some of Mr. Myers's own theories.\nThe intellect of the patient, according to Mr. Dunbar's view,\nremained unaffected, looking on, as it were, at the conflict\nof the senses. This theory was apparently borne out by the\nfact that the more intelligent the person experimented upon,\nthe more difficult it seemed to bring him under the influence\nof the drug. He quoted as a possible instance the story\ntold in the Symposium, of how at a certain feast Socrates\nalone remained unaffected, after all the other guests had\nsuccumbed to the effects of the wine they had drunk, and\ncontinued all night discoursing of philosophy. He thought we\nshould, however, be cautious in our interpretation of the\neffects seemingly produced by drugs. There was always\nthe possibility of these effects being due to expectancy, though\n\f266 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, UKM.\nMr. Dunbar's own experiences were not apparently open to\nthis objection, as he had not read beforehand the accounts\nwith which his personal experiments coincided. It was also\npossible that the results might depend partly on the tempera\nment of the experimenter. For example, when reading some\nyears ago an account given by Herbert Spencer of his experi\nences under chloroform, Mr. Podmore had remarked that the\neffects apparently produced by the drug were in accordance\nwith Spencer's own philosophical theories. Sir W. Eamsay's\nand Sir H. Davy's accounts both coincided with Mr. Ihmbar's,\nbut in a number of experiments made by Sir H. Davy on\ntwenty other persons, the anaesthetic had produced merely\npleasurable sensations, with a marked inclination to laughter.\nMR. J. G. PIDDINGTON read an account of Oliver Wendell\nHolmes' sensations whilst under the influence of ether, which\nin some respects coincided with Sir H. Davy's. It was not\nstated, however, whether Dr. Holmes had read the latter's\naccount beforehand.\n.Referring to the sense of precognition sometimes experienced\nby persons under the influence of anaesthetics, Mr. Piddingtou\nobserved that he had himself once had this feeling after\ntaking chloroform and ether, and on hearing, during the process\nof awakening, a remark made by the doctor, had said to him\ntwo or three times, in an excited and insistent manner, that he\nhad known beforehand exactly what he, the doctor, had been going\nto say. He thought, however, that it was not at all necessary\nto assume a real precognitive faculty in order to explain this\nphenomenon, as it might have been only a disturbance\u2014pro\nduced by the drug\u2014of the perception of time-relation which made\nhim think that his impression had preceded the doctor's remark,\nwhereas it had probably followed it.\nSm LAWRENCE JONES, referring to a case published in the\nProceedings (Vol. VIII., p. 194) of apparent clairvoyance during\na state of unconsciousness from exhaustion, inquired if any cases\nof a similar nature had been observed in persons under the\ninfluence of chloroform, etc.\nMR. Fox PITT stated that in his experience the effects of\nbenzene were not similar to those produced by chloroform or\nether. There was a certain fascination in inhaling benzene,\nand it seemed somehow to intensify the sense of existence,\n\fJULI, 1904. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 267\nbut the actual effects upon himself had been exceedingly un\npleasant. All kinds of difficulties, worries, and unpleasantness\nhad seemed to be crowded together in his mind, and all power\nof overcoming or avoiding them seemed to be removed. Ether\nand chloroform, on the other hand, tended rather to give the\nimpression of solving such difficulties.\nDR. KINGSTON, in relating his own experiences, said that he\nhad found the loss of time sensation very marked\u2014e.g. he had\nfound himself wondering whether certain events had taken place\na clay ago or only a few minutes before. He had also had\na curious feeling of expansion, as though he had been blown\nout into something like a balloon, with all his sensations diffused\nthrough it, except for a few lines of thrilling vitality, which had\ngiven him the impression of having several souls. When he felt\nhimself becoming unconscious he had made efforts to keep awake,\nwhich produced the sensation of hauling himself up from some\nimmense depth, with a great shock every time he came to\nthe surface. Each time he went down again he seemed to sink\ndeeper, until when the effort to rise became too great, he let\nhimself go, and thereupon lost consciousness.\nMR. PIDDINGTON suggested that the possible effects produced\nby expectancy might be tested in the case of benzene by\nassuring the patient to whom it was to be administered\nthat he would find its effects exceedingly pleasant\u2014that being\nprecisely the contrary of what Mr. Fox Pitt and Mr. Dunbar had\nfound to be the case with this drug.\nMR. DUNBAR, replying to questions raised by these speakers,\nsaid he fully agreed with Mr. Podmore that the effects produced\nby many of these drugs would in all probability vary with\nthe temperament of the individual, but that in those cases\nin which a drug produced the same effect on many indi\nviduals, the personal equation could perhaps be neglected.\nWith regard to Herbert Spencer's statement that under\nchloroform he experienced a depression of the higher faculties\nin order, the highest going first and the lowest last, Mr.\nDunbar thought this experience largely imaginary. If it was\na fact, then it was a contradiction in terms, for what would\nthe faculty which appreciated the entire process be ? The\nfaculty which could follow the changes in mentation must\nsurely be the highest process of mentation.\n\f2G8 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JCLT, 1904.\nIn reply to Sir Lawrence Jones, Mr. Dunbar spoke of the\ngreat difficulty of obtaining reliable instances of clairvoyance in\nthis connection ; he said it was a fairly common thing for patients\nto state that they were conscious of the steps of an operation,\nbut that never within his experience had there been anything\napproaching to accuracy in their accounts. It did not, how\never, seem improbable that clairvoyance could occur in these\nconditions, because once the consciousness of the individual\nis detached from his environment, we have a state full of\nstrange possibilities. Mr. Dunbar agreed with Mr. Fox Pitt\nin his statement that benzene produced sensations of an\neminently disagreeable nature, but said he had not mentioned\nit, as he had not observed the effect in any one else.\nThe sole value of these experiences lay in their univer\nsality, and only in so far as an experience was general could\nit be regarded as bearing on general psychological laws.\nG. F. WATTS, K.A.\n(HONORARY MEMBER or THE S.P.R.)\n[The following lines were written by Mr. Myers shortly\nafter visiting Mr. Watts some years ago, and may now not\ninaptly be cited in memory of our late Honorary Member.\u2014\nEDITOR.]\nIf it be true that there is a spiritual world, wherein, even\nwhile still on earth, we veritably are living; if it be true that\nwith man's growing knowledge his conviction of that unseen\nenvironment must for ever deepen;\u2014then types of character must\nneeds arise responsive to that great revelation ; there must be\nsaints of a universal religion, who without thought of sect or\ndogma shall answer to the welcoming Infinite with simplicity\nand calm. No man, perhaps, has fulfilled this type more per\nfectly than the great painter who must soon, from a life's work\non earth which none of his generation has equalled, pass to\ncontinue with all readiness his task elsewhere.\nWhen last I saw Mr. Watts, in great old age, among the\nsymbolic pictures of his later years, he seemed to me to have\nbecome himself a sacred symbol ; and I should scarcely have\nwondered, as I gazed on him, if he had vanished into air. His\n\fJULT, 1904. G. F. Watts, R.A. 269\nlook, his words were simple ; he stood as it were unconcernedly\nin both worlds, the one as present to him as the other.\n\"Naturally I have cared to work at these ideas; I have never\ncajed very much for anything else .... I felt that this was\nso; and I have all my life tried to express it.\"\nIt has fallen to me to speak with one other man .only\nwho seemed to me as close to things divine. The mighty\nmind of Tennyson \" heaved with the heaving deep \" ; to the\nchildlike intuition of Watts the great secret was, as the\nFrench phrase goes, simple commc bonjonr. For such a man\nwhat we call death is reduced to a mere formality ; and by\nan opening of inner vision the immanent becomes the manifest\nheaven. F. W. H. M.\nCASE.\nL. 1138. Simultaneous Dreams.\nTHE following case of dream impressions coinciding with a\nfatal accident that occurred to the brother of the dreamers\nwas sent to us by the kindness of Miss K. Raleigh, of\nBeechwood, Loudwater, Bucks, a lady well known to the\nEditor.\nThe accounts were enclosed in a letter from Miss Ealeigh,\ndated April 28th, 1904, and were, she says, written by the\nwitnesses independently of each other. They gave their full\nnames and addresses, but wished initials only to be printed.\nMiss M. L. B. wrote as follows :\nIn compliance to the request of Miss K. Raleigh I have written\nthus.\nOn the evening of November 18th, 1903, I, M. L. B., retired\nabout half-past nine o'clock and fell asleep. I had a most peculiar\nvision or dream. I thought I was walking through streets in a\nstrange place ; it was artificially lighted ; there were a number of\npeople walking to and fro on either side of the streets. I heard\na peculiar noise, and turned partly round to see what was the\ncause of it. A vehicle was coming rushing across the top of the\nstreet ; I was a few paces down ; it looked something like a train,\nbut not a train, it was running on metals ; something was coming\ndown where I had crossed ; there was an awful crash as if my (so-\ncalled) train had run upon something, and in a moment something\nheavy fell with a sickening thud on the pavement, at my feet.\n\f270 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JCLT, 1904.\nI tried to cry out, but could not. In a moment a crowd had\ncollected, and several people picked up the body which had fallen\nat my feet. I could see it was a man. I could not see the face,\nonly a large gash on the back of the head, and near the lips, from which\nthe blood was flowing. As the drops fell they splashed into a\npuddle of blood on the ground and sprinkled on to me. Some one\nsaid, \" Take him away.\" I tried to cry out, \" What shall I do 1 \" and\nawoke trembling and perspiring, and crying bitterly.\nI could not think where I was, [but] found I was in bed, and had\nbeen dreaming, as I supposed. I lay quite still for fear of disturbing\nmy sister. In a short time my sister lit a match and looked at\nher watch, and said, \" It is past eleven o'clock.\" I did not tell her of\nmy dream, as I did not wish her to worry. I thought it strange\nfor her to get a light and tell me the time. I was fearfully\nworried for some days.\nOn the Monday morning following, I had another dream. I\ndreamed my brother, H. B., (I had not seen since the previous\nJanuary, or even heard from him) was lying ill in a strange room,\nand a man was putting him in an ambulance. I thought he said,\n\"Take my sister away, I am not fit to be where she is.\" He\nlooked so strange, I awoke again in great agitation.\nOn the same evening a young friend, Miss P., came to call, and\nmy sister left us alone. After she had gone I said, \"R., have you\nheard if my nephew, or any one belonging to me, has met\nwith an accident, and they will not tell me, as I have had such\nstrange dreams and feel I don't know what to do with myself.\nI feel haunted. I have not felt like this since just before Mother\ndierl.\" I told my dreams and cried very much. She said, \"Don't\nfret,\" and assured me she had heard nothing concerning any one\nbelonging to me. I still felt miserable.\nOn the 26th of November we received the news that our brother,\nH., was lying ill in F Infirmary, in a precarious condition; on\nthe 27th we received the news that he was dead, died the previous\nday after the letter was posted to us. On the paper enclosed you\nwill find all the main information we received regarding our brother's\naccident and death. If you compare the dates you will find the\naccident happened at the time I was dreaming about it. I had\nbetter state here I have never seen an electric tramcar. What I\nhave written here is perfectly true.\nI have not seen my brother either living or dead since a year\nlast January, as I was much too ill to go to his funeral.\n\fJOLT, 1904. Case. 271\nThe other sister, Miss H. M. B., wrote :\nNovember 18th, 1903, I went to bed at 10 p.m. and was going to sleep\nwhen a loud crashing sound roused me, and the voice of my brother\nfollowed saying, \" Oh Duck, I am done for.\" I covered my eyes\nand said, \"Oh H., is it your face that is hurt?\" He said \"No.\"\nThe horror of it was extremely depressing. It was about 11.15 and\nI could get no sleep through the night, it worried me so. I had\nnot seen my brother since the previous January, and he had not\nwritten to me since. Duck was his pet name for me.\nMiss P., the friend referred to in the first account, wrote :\nOn the 23rd of November, 1903, I, R. P., went to to see\nmy friend Miss M. B. On the 23rd of November my friend told\nme of her distressing dream that she had dreamed on the 18th of\nNovember, 1903; it seemed as if she could not forget it, she said\nthat it seemed to worry her so. The time that my friend told\nme about her dream was between the hours of seven and eight\no'clock in the evening, and my friend said it was some one had\nmet with an accident, and the face was hurt, but [she] could not see\nwho it was, and my friend said that it looked like a train, and\nyet not so, as it had no engine on, and my friend has never seen\nan electric car at all, and she could not forget her dream ; and then\non the 26th of November my friend had news about her brother's\naccident. R. P.\nMiss H. M. B. wrote later :\nI did not mention my dream to any one until after my brother's\naccident. ... He died on November 26th, 1903, and then my\nsister told me about her dream, and I said, how very strange [it\nwas] we should each have such a strange experience and at the\nsame time ; I then told her all about it.\nIt thus happens that no further corroboration was obtainable\nof Miss H. M. B.'s experience ; but the statement in her sister's\naccount that she lit a match, looked at her watch, and told\nher what time it was, affords some indirect evidence in con\nfirmation of her own.\nThe following paragraph describing the accident is taken\nfrom Lloytfs Weekly News, of November 29th, 1903.\nELECTRIC TRAMCAR FATALITY.\nAt F. yesterday Mr. D held an inquiry on H. B., 47, a horse\ndealer, of . Mr. H. W. T , an official at the Bank of\n\f272 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1904.\nEngland, living at , stated that at a quarter to eleven on the\nnight of Wednesday week [November 18th] he was on an electric\ntramcar going westward. They had just restarted from the Pack\nHorse when the deceased drove out of the Devonshire Road into\nthe High Road right across the track of the car. He did not appear\nto see the car. The car was pulled up at once, but it caught the\ntrap and overturned it, and deceased was thrown out and struck\nhis head on the kerb. It was an unavoidable accident. It appeared\nthat the deceased was surgically attended at the Hospital, and\nthen removed home. On Monday [November 23rd] he was admitted\nto the infirmary, where he died from the effects of concussion and\nlaceration of the brain and fracture of the skull. The jury returned\na verdict of \"Accidental death.\"\nMiss Raleigh writes :\n[May 3rd, 1904.]\nTo the best of my belief Miss H. M. B. and Miss M.

They related their dreams to me about a fortnight\nafter the death of their brother, but in less detail than in their\nwritten account. The main features in the written account corre\nspond with what they told me.\nMiss M.

The contents should of\ncourse be previously unknown to any one, except the writer,\nwho should arrange that information of his death should be com\nmunicated to the Society.\nSince the publication of Mr. Myers's book, a number of such\nletters have been received and are now stored at our Rooms.\nIn many cases, however, a difficulty may arise in judging when\n\fJULT, 190-1. Test* of Personal Identity. 273\nit is desirable to open the envelope, as supposing a message\npurporting to come from the writer is received, it may not be\nclear whether or not it is supposed to relate to the contents\nof the envelope.\nTo obviate this difficulty, Colonel Taylor has recently suggested\na plan which we should like to recommend to persons who\nare trying to obtain evidence in this way. It is that the\nwriter should prepare, say, three envelopes, the writing inside\neach being the answer to a question written on the outside.\nThe answer should, of course, be thoroughly well wrapped up\ninside the envelope, which should be sealed, and the question\nshould, obviously, be of such a kind that it would be almost\nimpossible to answer it by a mere guess. The question and\nanswer should relate to some very definite fact, known\nonly to the person who is hoping to communicate it after\nwards, and it should be a fact of so much interest to\nhimself that he might reasonably be expected to remember it\nafterwards, if he kept any recollection at all of his previous\nlife.\nIf there appeared to be some distinct evidence during a\nsitting that the medium was being controlled by or in com\nmunication with the writer, one of the envelopes might be\npresented and an attempt made to get a definite answer to\nthe question outside it. The answer should then be carefully\nrecorded, after which it should be handed to some responsible\nperson, who would then open the envelope.\nCASE OF THE CURE OF WARTS\nBY \" CHARMING.\"\nCases of the cure of warts by \" charming \" have appeared\nin the Journal from time to time ; see especially those recorded\nby Mr. C. P. Coghill (Vol. VIII. p. 7, January, 1897, and\nVol. IX. p. 100, July 1899), and by Miss M. H. Mason (Vol.\nVIII. p. 226, April 1898, and Vol. IX. p. 223, April\n1900). The following case is unique in our records in that\nthe cure was apparently performed at a distance, the man who\nperformed it never having met the patient. This shows\nthat (as most probably happens in cures performed close at\nhand) the effect must have been produced by suggestion and\n\f274 Journal of Society for Psychical, Research. JULY, 19<M.\nexpectancy,\u2014unless, indeed, the cure took place in the ordi\nnary course of nature, the possibility of which must always\nbe kept in view.\nWe were first informed of the case by the kindness of\nMrs. Spencer Graves, who wrote to us as follows :\nLITTLE MISSENDEN ABBEY, GREAT MISSENDEN,\nBUCKS, 29th January, 1904.\n. . . My story of the warts is this. A friend had a little girl aged\n10 with both hands covered with warts and two on her lip. She was\nexpressing her distress at this when a mutual friend of hers and mine\nsaid, \" You will laugh at me, but an old man in our village cured one\non my hand when I was a girl by charming. He won't say what he\ndoes, and does not require to know anything about the person except\nthe number of warts.\" The mother laughingly asked her to tell \"Old\nTom,\" and on the child counting, there were 50. I forgot all about the\nincident till about two months after, when my friend was staying with\nme, and I suddenly said, \" How about D 's warts 1 \" She answered,\n\" They have nearly disappeared ; I expect when I return they will have\nquite gone.\" On her return home she wrote me there was no sign of\none. The old man asks no payment, but is very pleased with any\npresent. He is well known in the country round as a doctor for horses,\nis a herbalist, and a shoemaker, over 80. I have not verified all this\nas to time, place, etc., but this is the main outline.\nBEATRICE GRAVES.\nWe wrote to Mrs. Spencer Graves asking for first-hand accounts\nfrom her friend and the mother of the child, and she replied :\nLITTLE MISSENDEN ABBEY, GREAT MISSENDEN,\nBUCKS, March Uth, 1904.\nI regret having been so long in responding to your enquiries about\nthe -wart cure, but I could not get the two accounts written by the two\nladies ; they kept forgetting about it. However, now I enclose them,\nand think it is a very interesting case, knowing all concerned so inti\nmately. You will see the child and the old man never met nor com\nmunicated with each other, only through others. One was in Wales,\nthe other [in] Norfolk. . . .\nThe accounts enclosed were as follows :\nHarry Allen, horse clipper and vet., age over 80, has lived all his\nlife at Attleboro', in Norfolk. Tall, stout, clean shaven, and had a\nround, merry face (very wrinkled with age now).\n\fJULY, 190-4. Cure of Warts by Charming. 275\nHe was told about the wart charm when a boy of eight ; some old\nman told him, and he must not tell the secret to any one else, or he\ncould not charm the warts away. His wife and son do not know what\nhe does. Some time back I had a wart on my finger, and stopped him\nin the road and asked if he could cure it. He looked at the place, and\nsimply said, \" Only one, lady ? that'll be all right, that will go,\" and in\na short time it did, and has not returned. I have heard about many\nchildren he has cured in the village. In the case of the little girl with\nthe 50 on one hand, 15 on the other, and one on lip, he did not see\nher. I first asked him if he could do anything in it. He said,\n\" You get the lady just to write the number down on a slip of paper.\"\nI think I told him the child lived in Wales, and a girl. I took\nhim the letter, and tore out the piece for him with the number; he\nasked me to give it him so as not to forget. He seemed very much\nastonished at the number he had to deal with, and said, \" I must\nget to work at once.\" He did not say how long it would take for\nthe charm to work\u2014\"may be a fortnight or more, as it's a big\nlot.\"\nThe old mau is quite a well-known character in the place, and\nhas been very clever with horses ; believes in old-fashioned remedies,\nI think. . . IDA K. SALTEH.\nBROOMFIELD HALL, MOLD,\nFLINTSHIRE, March 12th, 1904.\nI have been asked to send you an account of how my daughter's\nwarts were cured.\nWhen she was about seven a very large one came on one hand\nand two smaller ones on the other, and remained for about two\nyears, when the large one came off\u2014the result, we thought, of her\nconstant playing in sea water. When she was nine we noticed\nthey were increasing, and they became most unsightly, particularly\non one hand. We tried many remedies, with no result whatever.\nThe strong acids applied by a doctor appeared rather to increase\nthem, and I then heard through a friend of an old man in Norfolk\nwho could charm them. He merely asked for the numbers, which\nI sent. Fifty on one hand, seventeen on the other, were, I think,\nthe numbers, and one on her face below her lips. I was away from\nhome at the time, and her governess counted them, and I wrote\nto my friend giving the number. There was no result for a fort\nnight, and then some of them become rather painful, and they\nconstantly bled, without apparently any reason. These symptoms\n\f276 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1904.\ncontinued for about a fortnight or three weeks, when we noticed\nthey were getting smaller, and very gradually they disappeared\nuntil they had absolutely gone, leaving no scar at all. It was\nabout two months or a little longer before they all disappeared,\nand there has been no return up to now, nearly a year after. I\ndon't think the child thought very much about it, though she\nknew that the man was trying to cure her, and, childlike, felt no\ndifficulty in believing he could. Of course, while they were painful\nshe must have thought of them, otherwise they didn't seem to\ntrouble her at all, as she never seemed to realise the unsightliness\nof them, so that there seemed no conscious effort on the child's\npart to corroborate the old man's efforts, for the success of which I\nam utterly at a loss to account.\nCONSTANCE SUMMERS.\nWe then wrote to enquire whether the large wart that\nappeared at the age of seven was the only one that had\ngone away of itself, or whether any of the others Lad simi\nlarly come off; also when the \"cure\" had begun, and when\nthe last wart had disappeared. Mrs. Summers replied as\nfollows :\nApril Glh, [1904].\n... I am afraid I cannot give you the exact date myself, but\nI think the old man was told of them early in May, and they had\nall gone by the end of July. Dorothy at the time was just ten\nyears old. The smaller warts she had when she was seven had\nnever gone, and the only one that ever went was the one large one on\na finger, which came off whole one day, while the others gradually\ndisappeared. I only mentioned that one, because the way in which\nit went was so different. We attributed it to the action of the\nsea-water, whether rightly or not I cannot say.\nCONSTANCE SUMMERS.\nENDOWMENT FUND FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nSINCE the Donations to the Endowment Fuud mentioned in\nthe Journal for May, 1904, we have received \u00a3100 from Mrs.\nF.

OCT., 1904.\nCASE.\nL. 1139 Dream.\nTHE following case of apparent telepathy from an animal\nwas first published in The Times for July 21st, 1904, from\nwhich we quote Mr. Eider Haggard's account of it :\nDITCHINGHA&I, July Kith.\nPerhaps you will think with me that the following circumstances\nare worthy of record, if only for their scientific interest. It is\nprincipally because of this interest that, as such stories should 'not\nbe told anonymously, after some hesitation I have made up my\nmind to publish them over my own name, although I am well aware\nthat by so doing I may expose myself to a certain amount of ridi\ncule and disbelief.\nOn the night of Saturday, July 9, I went to bed about 12.30,\nand suffered from what I took to be a nightmare. I was awakened\nby my wife's voice calling to me from her own bed upon the other\naide of the room. As I awoke, the nightmare itself, which had been\nlong and vivid, faded from my brain. All I could remember of it\nwas a sense of awful oppression and of desperate and terrified\nstruggling for life such as the act of drowning would probably\ninvolve. But between the time that I heard my wife's voice and the\ntime that my consciousness answered to it, or so it seemed to me, I\nhad another dream. I dreamed that a black retriever dog, a most\namiable and intelligent beast named Bob, which was the property\nof my eldest daughter, was lying on its side among brushwood, or\nrough growth of some sort, by water. My own personality in some\nmysterious way seemed to me to be arising from the body of the\ndog, which I knew quite surely to be Bob and no other, so much\nso that my head was against its head, which was lifted up at an\nunnatural angle. In my vision the dog was trying to speak to me\nin words, and, failing, transmitted to my mind in an undefined\nfashion the knowledge that it was dying. Then everything vanished,\nand I woke to hear my wife asking me why on earth I was making\nthose horrible and weird noises. I replied that I had had a night\nmare about a fearful struggle, and that I had dreamed that old Bob\nwas in a dreadful way, and was trying to talk to me and to tell\nme about it. Finally, seeing that it was still quite dark, I asked\nwhat the time was. She said she did not know, and shortly after\nwards I went to sleep again and was disturbed no more.\nOn the Sunday morning Mrs. Rider Haggard told the tale at\n\fOCT., 1904. Case. 279\nbreakfast, and I repeated my story in a few words. This I need\nnot do here, as the annexed statements set out what occurred quite\nclearly.\nThinking that the whole thing was nothing more than a disagree\nable dream, I made no enquiries about the dog and never learned\neven that it was missing until that Sunday night, when my little\ngirl, who was in the habit of feeding it, told me so. At breakfast\ntime, I may add, nobody knew that it was gone, as it had been seen\nlate on the previous evening. Then I remembered my dream, and\nthe following day enquiries were set on foot.\nTo be brief, on the morning of Thursday, the 14th, my servant,\nCharles Bedingfield, and I discovered the body of the dog floating\nin the Waveney against a weir about a mile and a quarter away.\nThe two certificates of the veterinary surgeon, Mr. Mullane, are\nenclosed herewith. They sufficiently describe its condition.\nOn Friday, the 15th, I was going into Bungay to offer a reward\nfor the discovery of the persons who were supposed to have destroyed\nthe dog in the fashion suggested in Mr. Mullane's first certificate,\nwhen at the level crossing on the Bungay road I was hailed by two\nplatelayers, who are named respectively George Arterton and Harry\nAlger. These men informed me that the dog had been killed by a\ntrain, and took me on a trolly down to a certain open-work bridge\nwhich crosses the water between Ditchingham and Bungay, where\nthey showed me evidences of its death. This is the sum of their\nevidence :\nIt appears that about 7 o'clock upon the Monday morning, very\nshortly after the first train had passed, in the course of his duties\nHarry Alger was on the bridge, where he found a dog's collar torn\noff and broken by the engine (since produced and positively identi\nfied as that worn by Bob), coagulated blood, and bits of flesh, of\nwhich remnants he cleaned the rails. On search also I personally\nfound portions of black hair from the coat of a dog. On the Monday\nafternoon and subsequently his mate saw the body of the dog floating\nin the water beneath the bridge, whence it drifted down to the\nweir, it having risen with the natural expansion of gases, such as, in\nthis hot weather, might be expected to occur within about 40 hours\nof death. It would seem that the animal must have been killed\nby an excursion train that left Ditchingham at 10.25 on Saturday\nnight, returning empty from Harleston a little after 11. This was\nthe last train which ran that night. No trains run on Sunday, and\nit is practically certain that it cannot have been killed on the\n\f280 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1904.\nMonday morning, for then the blood would have been still fluid.\nAlso men who were working around when the 6.30 train passed\nmust have seen the dog on the line (they were questioned by Alger\nat the time and had seen nothing), and the engine-driver in broad\ndaylight would also have witnessed and made a report of the accident,\nof which in a dark night he would probably know nothing. Further,\nif it was living, the dog would almost certainly have come home\nduring Sunday, and its body would not have risen so quickly from\nthe bottom of the river, or presented the appearance it did on\nThursday morning. From traces left upon the piers of the bridge\nit appears that the animal was knocked or carried along some yards\nby the train and fell into the brink of the water where reeds grow.\nHere, if it were still living,\u2014and, although the veterinary thinks\nthat death was practically instantaneous, its life may perhaps have\nlingered for a few minutes,\u2014it must have suffocated and sunk,\nundergoing, I imagine, much the same sensations as I did in my\ndream, and in very similar surroundings to those that I saw therein\n\u2014namely, amongst a scrubby growth at the edge of water.\nBoth in a judicial and a private capacity I have been accustomed\nall my life to the investigation of evidence, and, if we may put\naside our familiar friend \"the long arm of coincidence,\" which in\nthis case would surely be strained to dislocation, I confess that that\navailable upon this matter forces me to the following conclusions :\nThe dog Bob, between whom and myself there existed a mutual\nattachment, either at the moment of his death, if his existence can\nconceivably have been prolonged till after 1 in the morning, or, as\nseems more probable, about three hours after that event, did succeed\nin calling my attention to its actual or recent plight by placing\nwhatever portion of my being is capable of receiving such impulses\nwhen enchained by sleep, into its own terrible position. That sub\nsequently, as that chain of sleep was being broken by the voice of\nmy wife calling me back to a normal condition of our human ex\nistence, with some last desparing effort, while that indefinable part\nof me was being slowly withdrawn from it (it will be remembered\nthat in my dream I seemed to rise from the dog), it spoke to me,\nfirst trying to make use of my own tongue, and, failing therein, by\nsome subtle means of communication whereof I have no knowledge\ntelling me that it was dying, for I saw no blood or wounds which\nwould suggest this to my mind.\nI recognise, further, that, if its dissolution took place at the\nmoment when I dreamt, this communication must have been a\n\fOCT., 1904. Case. 281\nform of that telepathy which is now very generally acknowledged\nto occur between human beings from time to time and under\nspecial circumstances, but which I have never heard of as occurring\nbetween a human being and one of the lower animals. If, on the\nother hand, that dissolution happened, as I believe, over three hours\npreviously\u2014what am I to say ? Then it would seem that it must\nhave been some non-bodily but surviving part of the life or of the\nspirit of the dog which, so soon as my deep sleep gave it an\nopportunity, reproduced those things in my mind, as they had\n*lready occurred, I presume, to advise me of the manner of its end\nor to bid me farewell.\nThere is a third possibility which I will quote, although the\n\u00abvidence seems to me to be overwhelmingly against it, and, for the\nreasons already given, it is inherently most improbable\u2014namely,\nthat the dog was really killed about half-past 6 on the Monday\nmorning, in which case my dream was nothing but a shadow of its\nforthcoming fate.\nPersonally, however, I do not for a moment believe this to have\nbeen the case, especially as the veterinary's certificate states that\nthe animal's body must have been \" over three days \" in the water\nat the time of its discovery.\nOn the remarkable issues opened up by this occurrence I cannot\nventure to speak further than to say that,\u2014although it is dangerous\nto generalise from a particular instance, however striking and well\nsupported by evidence, which is so rarely obtainable in such\nobscure cases,\u2014it does seem to suggest that there is a more intimate\nghostly connection between all members of the animal world,\nincluding man, than has hitherto been believed, at any rate by\nWestern peoples ; that they may be, in short, all of them different\nmanifestations of some central, informing life, though inhabiting the\nuniverse in such various shapes. The matter, however, is one for\nthe consideration of learned people who have made a study of these\nmysterious questions. I will only add that I ask you to publish\nthe annexed documents with this letter, as they constitute the\nwritten testimony at present available to the accuracy of what I state.\nFurther, I may say that I shall welcome any investigation by\ncompetent persons.\nH.

OCT., 1904.\nBUNGAY, July 14th, 1904.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014In pursuance of your instructions I have inspected\nthe dog found in the water at the Falcon Bridge, Bungay.\nIt was in a very decomposed and tympanitic condition.\nIn answer to your inquiries,\n(1) I believe it is your dog Bob, which I have frequently\nattended and which was at my house for one week under treatment.\n(2) Cause of death.\nFracture of skull in three places, the skull being smashed almost\nto a pulp by some heavy, blunt instrument. The wounds are not\ncaused by gun shot.\n(3) The body must have been in the water over three days, and\nvery probably the dog was killed on the night of July 9th (Satur\nday), after which it was missing.\nBoth forelegs were fractured just below the knees. I should say\nthis was done by a large trap, probably an otter trap, as the\ninjuries are too severe and high up the legs to be caused by a\nrabbit trap. It seems probable that the dog went to the water to\ndrink and stood upon the table of the trap, his body being after-\nwards thrown into the river. P. J.

In reply to our request to be\nallowed to see the original documents, Mr. Haggard kindly lent\nthem to us for comparison with the printed copies and also\nsent us the originals of three other statements relating to the\ncase, which we print here.\n(1) From Mr. Mullane.\nBTJNGAY, July 15th, 1904.\nTo H. RIDER HAGGARD, ESQ.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014It is my opinion, from the condition of the dog's\nhead, that he was killed instantaneously by a very violent blow over\nthe skull. P. J. MULLANK.\n(2) from H. Alger.\nI was at my business on the line between Bungay and Ditching-\nham at 7 o'clock on the morning of Monday, the llth July, when\nonly one train had passed about 6.30, and found the broken collar\nof a dog lying there, which I produce, and had to scrape off the\ndried blood and some bits of flesh from the line. I asked several\npeople who were working about and were there when the 6.30 train\npassed, including Mr. Runnicles and Mr. Riches, if they had seen\na dog on the bridge, as one had been killed there. They said that\nthey had not.\nIf the engine-driver had seen a dog run over, he would have\nreported it. Under all the circumstances, I think that the dog must\nhave been killed by the late excursion train on Saturday night\nwhich left Ditchingham for Harleston at 10.25. From the way in\nwhich the flesh was carried, it was evidently killed by a train going\ntowards Bungay.1\nThe marks of blood upon the piles showed where the dog had\nfallen from the bridge into the reeds. These reeds grow in deepish\nwater.\nI did not myself see the dog in the water; my mate, Arterton,\nsaw the body of the dog after it had risen to the surface.\nIt was I who cut the collar as you see it now. I did so that\nit might be sewn together and used again for some other dog.\n[Signed] HARRY ALGER.\n1 'I !H- train that passes Ditchingham about 6.30 on Monday morning is also\none that goes towards Bongay.\u2014EDITOR.\n\fOCT., 1904. Case. 285\n(3) From C. Bedingfield.\nDITCHINGHAM, My 14M, 1904.\nMy master and I found the dog in the Waveney near the Falcon\nBridge on the morning of July 14th. It is the retriever dog, Bob,\n\u2022which I have known ever since it has been at Ditchingham House.\n[Signed] C. BEDINGFIELD,\n(Groom at Ditchingham House).\nIn reply to further questions as to the possibility of the dog\nhaving been killed on the Monday morning instead of Saturday\nnight, Mr. Haggard wrote to us :\nDITCHINGHAM HOUSE, NORFOLK,\nJuly 23rd, 1904.\nI believe that I am right in saying that if the dog had been killed\non the Monday morning, it certainly would not have floated by the\nMonday midday or afternoon when it was seen by Arterton.\nNo, I think the water is too deep for the body to have been seen\nlying at the bottom and been mistaken for a floating dog. Further,\nHarry Alger, when he found the traces of the accident, looked in\nthe water on the Monday morning and could find no dog. It must\ntherefore have risen to the surface between the Monday morning\nand Monday afternoon, as I believe it would naturally do, had it\nmet its end on the Saturday night. In short, I am absolutely con\nvinced that when I had my dream the dog had been dead for at\nleast three hours. Further, this appears to be evident : the injuries\nto the dog's head were such that death must have been instantaneous ;\nand even though life lingered in the tissues, as a doctor to whom I\nwas talking this morning told me it might do for a little while,\nfrom the moment that engine struck the dog's head, it must have\nbeen utterly incapable of thought or volition as we understand it\u2014\nthat is, its brain was destroyed; it was physically dead. It seems\nto result therefore that in order to produce the long subsequent\nimpressions upon myself, it must have been spiritually aliee. In\nshort, even supposing that I received those impressions at the moment\nof the death of the dog and stored them up for future use, or that\nthose impressions were flying about in the air like a wheeling hawk\nwaiting for an opportunity to settle on my head, they must still\nhave been emitted by the personality of an animal that was already\ndead, doubly dead from fatal injury followed instantly by drowning.\nI seem therefore to come to this conclusion. Either the whole\n\f286 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1904.\nthing is a mere coincidence and just means nothing more than\nindigestion and a nightmare, or it was the spirit of the dog on its\npassage to its own place or into another form, that moved my spirit,\nthereby causing this revelation, for it seems to be nothing less. . . .\nH. RIDER HAGGARD.\nFrom an interview in The Daily Chronicle of July 22nd,\n1904, to which Mr. Haggard referred us, saying that it was\n\" fairly accurate,\" we extract the following :\nBob, although he belonged to my daughter, who bought him three\nyears ago, was a great friend of mine, but I cannot say that my\nsoul was bound up in him.\nHe was a very intelligent animal, and generally accompanied me\nin my walks about the farm, and almost invariably came to say\ngood morning to me. He was rather rheumatic, as he was getting\ninto years\u2014seven perhaps\u2014but that did not prevent him going after\nrabbits, generally in company with Bustle, my spaniel.\nAnother letter from Mr. Haggard appeared in The Times of\nAugust 9th, 1904, discussing the issues involved, and giving\nfurther details of the probable mode and circumstances of the\ndog's death, as follows :\n... I am satisfied that the dog was destroyed about 10.27 on\nthe night of July 9th. It had, I think, been rabbit-hunting or\nfollowing some other canine attraction, and being hot and tired, lay\ndown upon a sleeper of the open bridge above the cool water, and\nresting its head upon its paws, placed them on the rail, thus lifting\nthem a few inches above the ground. This was its invariable custom\nwhen a turf edging or anything of the sort was available. Thus it\nwent to sleep. But whether asleep or awake, the blow which it\nreceived from the wheel guard of the engine must, I presume, if it\ndid not cause instant death, at any rate have utterly destroyed its\nmind-powers, unless dogs can think with some portion of their\norganism other than the brain, of which in this instance the case\nwas utterly smashed. . . .\n[As to the suggestion that the telepathic information may have\ncome from a human being who witnessed the death of the dog:]\nMy answer is that no human being would have been wandering\nabout on a dark night in a place so dangerous as an open timber-\nwork railway bridge over a river. I am convinced that the only\ncreature which can have seen the dog's death was another smaller\ndog which may or may not have been with it at the time. . . .\n\fOCT., 1904. Case. 287\nAs to the question whether he had had any other experi\nences of the kind, and in regard to some of the peculiar\npsychological features of this case, Mr. Haggard writes to us\nlater :\n... I never remember any other telepathic dream. From time\nto time I have had uneasy dreads which have proved baseless, but\nthe only tangible mysterious event which I can recall was a fore\nknowledge of future sorrow, which some months later proved itself\nto be fearfully accurate.\n. . . Was the nightmare or first dream the whole story of what\nhappened 1 I am inclined to think so from what I remember of it\nand the animal noises that I made (see my wife's evidence). To\nwhat can be attributed the hallucination that I seemed to rise from\nthe body of the dog ? This was one of the most curious parts of\nthe manifestation\u2014like the separation of soul and body, as one\nmight imagine it. Another curious point was the fashion in which,\nabandoning its attempt to talk (I thought because it was too slow)\nas I departed from it, the dog seemed to flash the intelligence of\nits dying state upon my mind. In an instant I knew all about it,\n\u2014through the intelligence, not through the senses.\nThis case is one of very unusual interest from several\npoints of view. It is, therefore, specially satisfactory to have\nit so well authenticated, and Mr. Rider Haggard deserves the\ngratitude of psychical researchers for having collected all the\navailable evidence so promptly and completely, and put it at\nthe disposal of the scientific world.\nWe have already published a few other cases of apparent tele\npathy from animals, e.g. one where a lady (Mrs. Bagot) staying\nat Mentone saw her dog running across the room at about the\ntime when it was dying at her home in Norfolk (see Proceedings,\nVol. XIV. p. 285), and another in which a lady and her\nhusband were wakened by hearing her dog running about her\nbedroom when it was actually in a distant part of the house,\nand in danger of being accidentally strangled (see Journal,\nVol. IV. p. 289). On the assumption that these were genuine\ninstances of telepathy, the impulse, in both cases, might have\noriginated in the mind of the person in charge of the dog ;\nwhereas in Mr. Haggard's case, no human being seems to have\nbeen aware of the condition of the dog.\n\f288 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1904.\nOn the other hand, we have had several instances of\ntelepathic hallucinations of animals which are clearly to be\nreferred to the minds of human beings, e.g. when a gentleman\nsees a dog enter the room at the time that his daughter is read\ning a description of just such a dog (see Journal, Vol. VII.\np. 243). It is obvious, indeed, that telepathic hallucinations,\nlike dreams, may take the form of any animate or inanimate\nobject, as we find both in experimental cases, and in crystal\nvisions. Subjective hallucinations similarly may take any form,\nthough it appears from the Report on the Census of Hallucina\ntions (see Proceedings, Vol. X. pp. 43, 127) that hallucinations\nof animals are comparatively rare among persons in a normal\nstate of health. (For instances of these, including a collective\nhallucination of a cat, see op. tit. pp. 127, 156, 305.) We\nfind again that veridical hallucinations of living or dying\npersons occasionally include figures of animals (see, e.g. Pro\nceedings, Vol. V. p. 469 ; Journal, Vol. VI. p. 129; Phantasms\nof the Living, Vol. II. p. 97). These seem to be mere\nadjuncts to the central telepathic element of the vision, and\n(as argued in Phantasms of the Living), are no doubt\u2014like\nthe clothes in which human apparitions generally appear to be\nclad\u2014due to the working up of the percept by the action\nof the percipient's own mind.\nIn Mr. Haggard's and Mrs. Bagot's cases, on the other\nhand, the vision represented the animal alone, and if\nveridical at all, referred obviously to the animal itself.\nThese two cases are, undoubtedly, analogous to the cases of\napparitions of dying persons, of which we have so many well-\nauthenticated examples ; but as long as there are so few of\nthe former type, they cannot be treated as of equal weight\nwith the latter.\nSeveral other interpretations besides that of a mental im\npulse from the supposed animal agent are possible. It might\nbe supposed that the vision was not really telepathic, but\nclairvoyant,\u2014that is due simply to the supernormal powers\nof the percipient. Cases are on record of distant events\nhaving been perceived in which no one known to the percipient\nwas concerned, e.g. visions of accidents to trains or ships ; but\nthere is practically no evidence of clairvoyance of events\nunknown to any one.\n\fOCT., 1904. Caxe. 289\nIn this case, Mr. Haggard lays stress on the fact that, as\nfar as can be ascertained, no human being could have known\nof the condition of his dog at the time of his dream ; and\nthis certainly supports the theory of telepathy from the dog.\nIt is noteworthy that there were many details in the vision,\nbesides the central fact of the dog's death, which seemed to\ncorrespond closely to the actual events ; while Mr. Haggard's\ndescription of his apparent absorption at the time in the\npersonality of the dog affords a curious parallel to the \" per\nsonations \" and \" dramatisations \" of sensitives.\nThere is also very strong evidence that the dog had been\ndead for several hours before the dream ; and Mr. Haggard argues\nthat, if so, the telepathic impulse probably came from its\nsurviving spirit. Considering, however, the enormous difficulties\nin the way of proving human survival, the evidence for which\nis far more abundant, this conclusion must be regarded as\nextremely dubious. In Phantasms of the Living a number of\ncases were published of apparitions seen a few hours after the\ndeath of the1 person represented ; but as these seemed to form\npart of a natural group including apparitions seen a few hours\nbefore the death, and others more precisely coinciding with it,\nthey were all treated as cases of the same central type, the\nessential feature in all being the death or approaching death\nof the agent. It was argued that when the apparition was\nseen shortly after the death, the telepathic impulse might well\nhave been transmitted at the time of death and have remained\nlatent in the percipient's mind until some appropriate moment\nof quiescence allowed it to emerge into his supraliminal con\nsciousness. We find this latency occasionally in cases of\nexperimental telepathy ; it often happens that some trifling\nobject perceived half consciously or sub-consciously in the day\nre-appears prominently in a dream at night ; while in ordinary\nlife there is always a certain interval, varying considerably in\ndifferent cases, between the reception of a sense impression\nand its development into a fully blown mental perception.-\nTaking all these facts into consideration, it has always been\nmaintained in our Society's publications that evidence derived\nfrom apparitions seen shortly after death is quite insufficient\nto establish survival, and our readers are aware of how many\ndifficulties arise even in the interpretation of cases of apparent\n\f290 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 19M,\ncontinued mental activity or telepathy from the dead at a\nconsiderable period after death. It must obviously be still more\ndifficult to obtain satisfactory evidence in the case of animals.\nAgain, if we admit the possibility of telepathy from animals,\nthis opens the door to a still larger number of possible sources\n\u2022of telepathic information. Thus there may have been several\nother animals besides the little dog \" Bustle \" who knew of the\nfate of the retriever \" Bob,\" and we cannot exclude the\npossibility of telepathy from them to Mr. Haggard.\nNo complete theory, in short, can be built up on any one\ncase, however well-established. The only way of advancing\nour knowledge of the subject is for other witnesses to follow\nthe example of Mr. Haggard in thoroughly sifting and com\npletely recording immediately after their occurrence, all cases\n\u2022that fall within their own experience.\nME. MERRIFIELD'S SITTING WITH D. D. HOME.\nIN the Journal for May, 1903, we printed an account by Mr.\nMerrifield of a sitting held with D. D.

Mr. Merrifidd's Sitting with D. D. Home. 291\nAll I could say before as to date was that what I described\nhappened in July, 1855. It was obvious that if I could learn\non what day in that year the moon set not far from 10 o'clock\nat night, I could fix the date in July within a day or two, and\nthen any one could find for himself how much light would have\nbeen available.\nThrough the kindness of a friend, to whom I mentioned this,\nand who has found and looked into an old diary, I learn that\nnew moon occurred in July, 1855, on the 14th of that month.\nThere was supper after the display of the \"spirit-hand,\" and as\nwe were not very late home that night, the setting of the moon\nwhich preceded the display could not have been long after ten\no'clock. On referring to Whitaker's Almanack for 1904, I find\nthat the day in July, 1855, on which the moon, then nearing\nher first quarter, must have set soon after ten o'clock was about\nthe 18th July, certainly not later.\nReferring to Whitaker again, it will be seen that there is no\nreal night until after the 20th July ; which means that until\nafter that date a faint trace of daylight still lingers in the north\nat midnight. It follows that at and for some time after ten\no'clock a fairly luminous sky would be seen through a window,\nespecially if facing in a westerly or north-westerly direction, and\nan object such as the form of \"a child's hand with a long\nwide sleeve attached to it\" intervening between an observer and\nthe window could well be discerned. (My recollection is that the\nwindow did face in that direction, and indeed had it been other\nwise, and that no direct moonlight was coming into the room,\nit would hardly have seemed necessary to wait until the moon had\nset.)\nMr. Lang speaks of \" such light as filters in when the moon has\nset on a clear night,\"\u2014an expression which seems to me not quite\napposite to the situation in which I saw the object. My whole\ndescription referred to outline only ; in my description as quoted\nby him I used no words but such as were applicable to thisj\n\"outline,\" \"form,\" \"long,\" \"wide.\" If any one is not satisfied\nthat the light under the circumstances stated was sufficient to see\nwhat I described, let him test it for himself. I have just done\nso, and there is no possible doubt about it. The light is ample\nfor that purpose. F. MKRRIFIELD.\n\f292 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Nov., 1904.\nCOUNCIL MEETING.\nThe 68th Meeting of the Council was held at 20 Hanover\nSquare, W., on Friday, October 21st, at 5 p.m.; the President,\nProfessor Barrett, in the chair. There were also present : Mr. W.\nW. Baggally, Mr. E. N. Bennett, Sir William Crookes, the Hon.\nE. Feilding, Mr. F. N. Hales, Sir Lawrence Jones, Sir Oliver\nLodge, Mr. St. G. L. Fox Pitt, Mr. S. C. Scott, Mrs. Sidg-\nwick, Mr. H. Arthur Smith, Lt.-Col. Le M. Taylor, Dr. C.\nLloyd Tuckey, Mrs. Verrall, and Miss Alice Johnson, Secretary.\nThe minutes of the last meeting were read and signed as\ncorrect.\nThe President referred to the great loss which the Council\nand the Society had suffered through the death of Sir A. K.\nStephenson, and a vote of condolence with his family was\npassed.\nEleven new Members and twenty-one new Associates were\nelected. The election of one new Member and thirty new\nAssociates of the American Branch was recorded. The names\nand addresses are given above.\nThe monthly accounts for June, and July to September\nwere presented and taken as read.\nAn ad interim report by the Secretary of recent experiments\nand cases in progress was read.\nPRIVATE MEETING FOR MEMBERS AND\nASSOCIATES.\nThe ninth of the series of Private Meetings for Members\nand Associates only was held in the large hall at 20 Hanover\nSquare, London, W., on Friday, October 21st, at 3.30 p.m.;\nthe President, Professor Barrett, in the chair.\nTHE PRESIDENT announced the receipt of a contribution of\n\u00a310 to the Endowment Fund from Miss Zula M. Woodhull.\nTHE HON. EVEKAED FEILDING read some notes on certain cases\nrecently received. The first of these was a series of experiments\nin automatic writing, carried out by Mrs. Verrall and Mrs.\nBradgate at the suggestion of Mr. Baggally, of which it is hoped\nthat a full report will appear later. Mrs. Verrall and Mrs.\n\fNov., 1904. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 297\nBradgate arranged to sit on the same day and at the same\nhour, once a week, to try for automatic writing, each in her\nown house,\u2014Mrs. Verrall at Cambridge and Mrs. Bradgate in\nLondon,\u2014the object being to try whether any correspondences\nbeyond what could be attributed to chance, or any indication\nof an intelligence external to the minds of the two automatists,\nwould appear in their writings. Eleven sittings were held.\nMuch of the writing, as always happens, was non-evidential,\nbut the cumulative effect of repeated instances in which Mrs.\nBradgate's script gave correct statements as to what Mrs.\nVerrall or members of her family were doing or thinking about\nat the time, or as to some trivial detail in her immediate\nsurroundings, suggested some kind of telepathic communication\nbetween the minds of the writei'S. On one occasion, Mrs. Verrall\nhad written a Greek phrase which immediately and inevitably\nsuggested to her Plato's \" Auto agathon \" (though she did not\nwrite these words) while on the same occasion the name\n\" Agatha \" had appeared in a detached manner in Mrs. Brad-\ngate's script. This might possibly be held to indicate that\nsome external intelligence was acting simultaneously on the\nminds of the two writers.\nA short discussion followed the reading of this case.\nSIR OLIVER LODGE said that he considered the experiments\nto be of great interest and value. In commenting on the\nmore important coincidences\u2014or, as he thought they should\nrather be termed, concordances or correspondences\u2014he said\nthat the \" Agatha \" incident seemed to him a remarkable one.\nMrs. Verrall having obtained a Greek line which suggested\n\" Agathon \" to her, and Mrs. Bradgate, at a sitting held con\ntemporaneously, having obtained the name \" Agatha,\" it would\nbe interesting to know which of the two writers had got\nthe idea first.\nMRS. VERRALL explained that it was only on reading through\nher script, after she had finished it, but before she knew any\nthing of what Mrs. Bradgate had written, that the idea of the\n\" Auto agathon \" came to her. The incident therefore could\nnot be explained as a telepathic transmission of what was\nconsciously in her mind at the time of the sitting, during\nwhich she was not conscious even of what she was writing ;\nbut it must of course be assumed that her subliminal con\n\f298 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1904.\nsciousness was aware, at least, of the Greek phrase she wrote,\nand possibly also had already associated with it the idea of\nthe \"Auto agathon.\"\nIn answer to other questions, Mrs. Verrall explained\nfurther that the statements counted as correct in Mrs.\nBradgate's script referred to contemporary incidents, not to\nthings that had happened at any remote date, so that the\nprobability of their being correct by chance was much lessened.\nThe communications did not purport to come from any\nparticular \" communicator.\"\nMR. FEILDING then proceeded to give accounts (1) of a\n\" haunted house,\" in which several apparitions were seen by\nmany different witnesses ; (2) of some hypnotic experiments of\nhis own with a boy who was an apprentice in the merchant\nservice. This boy, whom he called Jack Eoyston, was accus\ntomed to go into trances, during which he was \" controlled \" by\nwhat purported to be the spirits of various eminent artists.\nUnder the supposed influence of these controls, he used to\nsketch, blindfolded, outlines and designs for pictures, some of\nwhich had been worked up into finished pictures by an artist\nfriend of his. The artist himself worked in a semi-automatic\nmanner, by the direction of the boy's \" controls,\" and often did\nnot know what was intended to be represented by many of the\ndetails in the pictures till they were explained to him afterwards.\nTwo of the pictures thus produced were exhibited at the end\nof the meeting. They are for sale, and are now to be seen in\nthe rooms of the Society.\nOBITUARY.\nSIR AUGUSTUS K. STEPHENSON, K.C., K.C.B.\nTHE Society has sustained a severe -loss in the recent death\nof one of its most distinguished and generous supporters. Sir\nAugustus Keppel Stephenson, K.C., K.C.B., who for many years\nhas taken an active interest in our work, and diligently\nco-operated therein, enjoyed a long and distinguished legal\ncareer. Born in 1827, he was a graduate of Caius College,\nCambridge, in 1849; and became a student at Lincoln's Inn in\n1846, at the unusually early age of 19 years. With a prudence\nnot always regarded in recent times, however, he did not hurry\n\fNov., 1904. Obituary. 299\ninto forensic practice, and it was six years later before he was\ncalled to the Bar. He attained to considerable practice, par\nticularly in commercial and criminal cases, and so far commended\nhimself to the notice of the Government of the day as to\nreceive, in 1875, the appointment of Solicitor to the Treasury.\nHe had already been for some years Recorder of Bedford.\nFrom 1884 to 1894 he was the director of public prosecu\ntions, receiving the distinction of Queen's Counsel in 1890,\nand that of K.C.B. in 1885. Of acute intellect, and the most\ngenial of manners, Sir Augustus endeared himself to all who\nwere privileged with his acquaintance. He frequently cham\npioned in the press the cause of Psychical Research, and one\nof his latest business transactions was to make a special con\ntribution to our funds. We are the poorer, intellectually and\nfinancially, by his decease, but the Council will always hold\nin grateful remembrance the pleasure and the assistance which\nit has received from his labours. He rightly appreciated the\nprimary importance, in the present stage of our investigations,\nof a ceaseless accumulation and sifting of facts, and his critical\nacumen in the estimation of their relative value was always\nhelpful and welcome. He joined the Society as a Member\nin 1892, and for the last nine years has been an active member\nof the Council.\nH. ARTHUR SMITH.\nAN ACCOUNT OF THE INDIAN ROPE-CLIMBING\nTRICK.\nTHE Indian rope-climbing trick is one that is often referred\nto, but of which first-hand accounts seem to be extremely\nrare,\u2014perhaps because the trick itself is very rarely practised,\nso that it has been doubted whether it is ever performed\nat all. Dr. Hodgson writes (Journal, Vol. V. p. 85) that the\nstory is, in one form or another, very old, and that when he\nwas in India he made many enquiries about it, but \" failed to\nmeet any person who had witnessed anything that might have\nserved as a foundation for the story.\" Again, he states in his\narticle on Indian Magic and the Testimony of Conjurers (Pro\nceedings, Vol. IX. p. 363): \"The performances of all the\njugglers whom I saw were unquestionably conjuring tricks,\n\f300 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1904.\nand I sought in vain for an eye-witness, European or native,\nof the famous rope-exploit of which we have heard so much\nin travellers' tales. About three years ago a story spread\nthat this supposed trick was explicable by ' hypnotism.' It\nwas alleged that certain travellers had proved this by means\nof a kodak. The kodak showed no such scenes,\u2014rope taut\nas though fixed to an inevitable point in the air, disappearing\nboy, man following with a knife,\u2014bloody limbs and trunk, and\nhead falling,\u2014reintegration of the boy's organism, etc. This\nstory turned out, by the confession of its author, to be a\n' yarn,' as was obvious to myself when it first appeared,^\nnot only from the indications of the drawings given with the\nstory, but because the famous ' mango ' or tree-growing trick\nwas explained in the same way, viz., by hypnotic suggestion ;\nwhereas I was well aware that the latter was a simple con\njuring trick, every detail of which was known to me.\"\nWe were informed, however, a short time ago by one of\nour members, Mr. F. W. Hayes, that he knew a gentleman\nwho had witnessed the rope trick, and would be willing to\ngive us an account of it. Mr. Baggally therefore called on\nhim and obtained from him the following statement :\nMarch 19th, 1904.\nI, Sebastian Thomas Burchett, of No. 31 Westcroft Square,\nRavenscourt Park, witnessed the Indian rope-climbing trick at\nUmballa in 1900 or 1901. I do not recollect the exact date.\nA crowd of natives witnessed it at the same time. There were\nalso present many English soldiers belonging to the 4th Royal\nIrish Dragoons, the Somerset Light Infantry, and the 2nd West\nSurreys.\nI cannot give the names of any European witnesses who were\npresent on this occasion. Corporal Bidie, of the 4th Royal Irish\nDragoons, D Squadron, now stationed at Muttra, Bengal Presi\ndency, informed me that he had witnessed the same kind of\nperformance, but whether with the same conjurer I do not know.\nI could not say at what time the performance took place. If I\nremember rightly it was in the morning, at about 11 o'clock. The\nday was a fine one.\nA few minor tricks, with birds and a cage, \u2022 were done by the\nconjurer before he performed the rope-climbing trick. The audi\n\fNov., 1904. Account of tlie Indian Rope-Climbing Trick. 301\nence stood in a circle round an open space, in the centre of which\nthe conjurer stood. There were no trees near.\nThe rope was in a coil on the ground. The conjurer took one\nend and raised it hand over hand ; it appeared to ascend to a\nheight of about 15 to 20 feet.\nThe raised portion of the rope remained erect, while the other\nportion lay in a coil on the ground. The conjurer then got hold\nof a small boy, and said something to him in Hindustani. The boy\nthen began to climb the rope, hand over hand, with legs twisted\nround the rope in the ordinary way of climbing. When he got to\nthe top the boy disappeared, but I could not tell the exact\nmoment of disappearance. One seemed to be gradually aware\nthat he had disappeared, but not able to fix the exact moment of\ndisappearance. The conjurer then commenced to harangue the\ncrowd and to ask where the boy was. The boy then appeared in\nthe open space, but I do not remember whether he descended the\nrope or came from the outside of the crowd.\nAfter the performance I spoke to several soldiers of the 4th\nRoyal Irish Dragoon Guards, who told me that they had witnessed\nthe disappearance of the boy.\n(Signed) SEBASTIAN THOMAS BUKCHETT.\nWitness, W. W. BAGGALLY.\nThe above statement was signed in my presence by Mr. S. T.\nBurchett, in the house of Mr. F. W. Hayes, No. 12 Westcroft\nSquare. The latter gentleman being present at the same time.\nMr. S. T. Burchett is a gentleman about 24 years of age. He\ngave me the impression of being absolutely truthful. As this is\none of those rare cases of an Englishman who has personally wit\nnessed the Indian rope-climbing trick, it is to be regretted that he\nwas unable to give the names of other Europeans who witnessed\nthis performance at the same time.\nW. W. BAGGALLY.\nMr. Hayes then wrote to Mr. Baggally :\n12 WESTCROFT SQUARE, W., March 20, 1904.\nAfter our conversation with Mr. Burchett last night, I made a\nfresh search for my rough notes of the account he gave me (imme\ndiately after his arrival in London from India) of the rope-climbing\nperformance he had witnessed, and to-day I found them.\nAs I mislaid these notes' before I could make a clean copy, and\n\f302 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1904.\nas Mr. Burchett was not easily available to get his account again,\nI had no opportunity of getting a signed account, and therefore\nsend you an exact copy of my rough notes of his statement, which\nI am quite positive represent what was at the time a vivid, precise,\nand unhesitating recollection of his experience a few weeks pre\nviously.\nF. W. HAYES.\nThe following was the account enclosed in Mr. Hayes's letter.\nIt was afterwards submitted to Mr. Burchett, and signed by\nhim as correct :\n12 WESTCROFT SQUARE, W.,\nMar. 20th, 1904.\nCopy of statement taken down verbatim from Mr. S. T. Burchett,\nJan. 7, 1902, by me, F. W. Hayes.\n\"About 11 a.m. one hot morning in the first week of November,\n1901, while I was at Umballa, a native conjurer [came] to the\ncamp, accompanied by a boy, and offered to give a performance.\nThe man carried a bag containing a few small articles used in his\nfeats, and the boy bore on his head a basket. After saying he\nwould commence with the rope trick, the man took up his station\nwith the boy in the open ground before the bungalow. About 30\nEuropeans, including myself, stood round him, forming a complete\ncircle not more than 4 yards in diameter. About 30 natives\nstood outside to look on.\n\"The conjurer took from his basket a rope about an inch thick,\nand probably 8 yards long, which he coiled on the ground. From\nhis bag he produced a monkey's skull, painted red, and held it\nout in his right hand, while he addressed to it the words [in Hindo-\nstanee, omitted to be taken down]. This form of conjuration was\nrepeated with every succeeding trick. He then squatted down on\nhis heels, took hold of the end of the rope, and holding it upright,\npassed it upwards with a hand-under-hand movement as if he were\nlifting a straight rod out of the earth.\n\"The rope went up in the air rigidly until the end was about\n20 feet from the ground. The conjuror now stopped, said another\ncharm, and stood up, leaving the rope in the air, and the unused\nportion still coiled on the ground. He then held his hand just over\nthe boy's head, and signed to him to climb the rope, which he\ndid, hand-over-hand. I have no recollection of whether he used\nfeet or not.\n\fNov., 1904. Account of the Indian Rope-Climbing Trick. 303\n\"About a foot from the top of the rope the boy stopped, and a\nsecond or two afterwards vanished absolutely. The man called\nout, and we heard the boy's voice replying from up in the air.\nThen, just as suddenly as he had disappeared, the boy became\nvisible again, and climbed down to the ground. The rope sank\nafter him, and we examined it again.\n\"From what was said amongst the European spectators while this\nperformance was going on, and from what transpired in subsequent\ndiscussions, I am satisfied that all of us saw the same things\noccur, and saw them at the same respective stages.\n\"SEBASTIAN T. BURCHETT.\"\nMr. Baggally then sent the following questions to Mr.\nBurchett :\n(1) How was the boy dressed when he climbed the rope?\n(2) Did the boy proceed to undress when he got to the top 1\n(3) Did he throw his clothes down ?\n(4) Did the conjurer throw anything up into the air when the boy\nwas at the top 1\n(5) Did the conjurer light a fire and make a smoke ?\nMr. Burchett replied as follows :\nMarch 21th, 1904.\n(1) The boy was dressed, as far as I remember, with just a\nloose cloth round the middle; the cloth is just wrapped round,\nthen passed between the legs, and tucked in [at] the waist.\n(2) Not in this instance, though the undressing is a usual detail\nof the performance.\n(3) No.\n(4) No.\n(5) No fire or smoke.\nI understand from other people who have witnessed the trick in\nvarious places, that sometimes the juggler himself climbs up the\nrope after the boy, and also disappears. Then the limbs of the boy\nare thrown down one by one ; first, a leg, then an arm, and so on.\nThis variation I have never seen myself, so cannot vouch for it.\nWith regard to any further details I cannot bring any to mind.\nI saw Mr. Hayes last night, and he read over to me my original\nstatement, taken down almost immediately after my arrival in\nEngland, which was Dec. 23rd, 1901. The date on which Mr.\nHayes interviewed [me] was Jan. 7th, 1902.\n\f304 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1904.\nThere is, I see, a discrepancy in the two narratives with regard to\n\u2022one detail, i.e. the reappearance of the boy. I have evidently got\nthe details, or at least that particular one, somewhat mixed up\nwith the basket trick, which I witnessed twice.\nI therefore take this opportunity of stating that the boy\nreappeared and descended, the rope appearing to come down with\nhim.\nMr. Hayes' narrative is a very good one, and I am prepared\nto sign it.\nS. T. BURCHETT.\nIn spite of the evident care taken to report the incident\ncorrectly, it will be observed that there are several discrepancies\nbetween Mr. Burchett's earlier and his later accounts, the\nprincipal ones being the following:\n(1) The first (i.e. earlier) account states that the conjurer\ncame to the camp, accompanied by a boy : the second, that\nafter doing some preliminary tricks, he \"got hold of a small\nboy,\" as if the boy had no previous connection with him.\n(2) In the first account, the conjurer began with the rope\ntrick ; in the second he did \" a few minor tricks \" first.\n(3) In the first account the boy went up the rope hand\nover hand, and, says Mr. Burchett, \" I have no recollection of\nwhether he used feet or not.\" In the second account he says,\n\" The boy then began to climb the rope hand over hand, with\nlegs twisted round the rope in the ordinary way of climbing.\"\n(4) In the first account, after the boy had disappeared, \" the\nman called out, and we heard the boy replying from up in\nthe air.\" In the second account this incident is omitted\naltogether.\n(5) The first account says, \"Just as suddenly as he had\ndisappeared the boy became visible again, and climbed down\nto the ground. The rope sank after him.\" The second account\nsays, \" The boy then appeared in the open space, but I do\nnot remember whether he descended the rope, or came from\nthe outside of the crowd.\"\nThe comparison illustrates once more the unreliability of\nmemory with regard to such incidents as these. It is true\nthat the first account is considerably more detailed than the\nsecond, and the narrative has lost rather than gained in its\nremarkable features by lapse of time ; the most important\n\fNov., 1904. Account of the Indian Rope-Climbing Trick. 305-\ndetail which has been added in the second version relating to\nthe action of the boy's legs in climbing. Forgetfulness how\never, quite as much as the mythopceic tendency, may result\nin misleading impressions.\nWe cannot tell whether the things forgotten at the later\nstage in this case\u2014viz., that the boy came with the conjurer,\nand that they heard his voice replying from up in the air,\u2014\nhave or have not any bearing on the explanation of the\nmystery, as we do not know how the trick was performed ;\nbut it is obvious that one of the main obstacles to explana\ntion is the great difficulty of getting a really complete and\naccurate account of what happened.\nThe trick as described seems on the face of it to contain\ntwo principal elements ; (a) the rope standing upright in the\nair, and becoming sufficiently rigid to support the weight of\nthe boy as he climbed up ; (6) the disappearance of the boy.\nWith regard to (a), it is perhaps not inconceivable that a\ntrick rope might be constructed, with a jointed core of some\nrigid material, so arranged that the joints would become rigid\nwhen placed in a particular position ; but this is, of course, a\nmere hypothesis.\nWith regard to (6), it is difficult to explain the disappear\nance of the boy as anything but a negative hallucination,\nsimilar to those that can be imposed on susceptible hypnotic\nsubjects, when a person or object is made to appear invisible\nto them. Slight and momentary occurrences of this kind are\nnot uncommon in ordinary life ; e.g. it has probably happened\nto most of us to be unable to find some object that we wish\nto use and then to re-discover it under our eyes in the precise\nplace where we have been looking for it. What seems to\nhappen in such cases is not a momentary distraction of atten\ntion from the object, but a momentary incapacity to interpret\nthe sense impressions derived from it. In the case of the\nnegative hallucinations of hypnotic subjects, this incapacity is\nimposed on them deliberately by the verbal suggestion of'\nthe hypnotist, and there is of course no difficulty in imposing\nit on several subjects at once.\nIn the case of the rope trick, it would be absurd to suppose\nthat the spectators were hypnotised, and though there is plenty\nof evidence for the production by suggestion alone, without\n\f306 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1904.\nhypnosis, of many of the effects that can be produced by\nhypnotism\u2014curative and other\u2014there is not much evidence\nfor the production by this means of negative hallucinations.\nIt is, however, an important part of the equipment of the\nordinary conjurer to be able to guide the perceptions of the\nspectators, so that they see certain things and not others,\naccording to what he wishes. And it is not impossible that\noriental conjurers have attained to a much greater skill in\nthis way than Europeans ; though it must again be remem\nbered that this is only a hypothesis.\nTo illustrate it, we print here a letter addressed to Mr.\nE. Gurney in 1887 by a Japanese gentleman, who was then\nresident at Oxford. The letter is as follows:\nDEAR SIR, July Uth, 1887.\nIn reply to your letter, I venture to relate the\nfollowing account of a scene which I witnessed when I was in my\nown country last :\nIt was many years ago, when I was residing at Osaka, that I\nwas invited to attend a certain juggling-trick entertainment at a\nrelative's. The performer who was engaged on that occasion was\nsaid to be one of the best jugglers in the empire. He had then\nceased to perform in public, but occasionally came to private houses\nas a favour. There were about twenty present, who were either\nour relations or intimate friends of ours. The juggler, after per\nforming many wonderful tricks, called upon us to observe attentively\nall the people in the room, and where they were sitting. Then he\nsaid, \"I am about to produce a certain disappearance. But before\n1 can fulfil this intention I must ask you to observe a few rules\nwhich I now venture to mention : Firstly, no one must move from\nhis seat while this performance lasts ; secondly, you are not to\nconverse or communicate with your neighbour, or, in other words,\nyou are not to utter a single word ; and lastly, you must not touch\nyour neighbour.\" We of course agreed to his proposal. Then he\nsat opposite to us with his eyes closed, pretending to sleep. There\nensued a perfect silence, during which even the dropping of a pin\nmight be heard all over the room. We, many of us, naturally\nthought that he was going to disappear, so we watched him closely.\nBut to our disappointment, he was still on his seat, when at last\nhe opened his eyes drowsily. He then looked round the audience\nwith a disappointed expression, and sighed ; but not a word was\n\fNov., 190*. Account of the Indian Rope-Climbing Trick. 307\nuttered. Every one in the room looked terrified and awestruck,\nwhile the performer glared at us with his wild eyes in a way\nwhich made us almost shiver. Suddenly the silence was broken :\n\"I understand not,\" exclaimed the juggler, \"why you cannot\nkeep your promise. I asked you to remain in your seats while\nthis performance was going on ! What do I see now ? Many\nseats are empty ! \" The audience, who had hitherto been watching\nthe performer, at once turned their attention to themselves,\nnot imagining that any one had left the room. Strange indeed !\nThere were many empty seats which had been occupied a minute\nbefore. Could this mystery be performed by this fellow-mortal 1\nWas it a mesmeric glamour thrown over our minds and senses ?\nBut where had they gone to ? An explanation is impossible.\nWe sat there watching those empty seats with utter amazement.\nThen followed another dead silence ; whereupon the juggler stood\nup and spoke as follows : \" Ladies and gentlemen, I think this\nperhaps is the trick I intended to show you. You have tried hard\nto keep your promises, but you are overpowered by me.\" After a\nfew minutes' pause, he requested us to shut our eyes for a second\nor two, in order, he said, that the lost or disappeared souls might\nreturn without hesitation. To this we also agreed, and when his\nsignal was given we found all the seats were filled again as before.\nWe enquired of those who had disappeared, or seemed to be not\nthere, asking where they had gone, and when they had returned.\nThey answered that they had been there all the time, and had\nthemselves seen the empty seats of others. And this was confirmed\nby those who had been sitting next to the persons who had dis\nappeared. Thus everybody in the room saw different persons\ndisappear. . . . ISNETA MORI.\nWith regard to the writer of this letter, Mr. E. N. Bennett\nwrites to us:\nHERTFORD COLLEGE, OXFORD,\nOctober 3rd, 1904.\n. . . [This is what I have] discovered from the proprietor of the\n\" Old Parsonage,\" Banbury Road, Oxford, as to the Japanese Isneta\nMori. [He] was there, as you say, in 1887, and was then a young\nman of, say, 21, so that \"many years ago,\" \"when I was in my own\ncountry \" would bring one back to a very early age\u2014at least early\nfor first class evidential powers ! As far as I can learn, he was a\nyoung man of pleasant address and was regarded as thoroughly\n\f308 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1904.\nhonest and straightforward. The proprietor informs me that he\nsubsequently heard on fairly good authority that Isneta Mori had\nmet with a violent death\u2014he used the word \" assassinated.\" That\nis practically all I have gathered as to this Japanese who was in\nOxford for about one year only.\nWith regard to the age of the narrator at the time he\nwitnessed the performance, it would seem from the context\nthat the phrase \" many years ago \" is used loosely and pro\nbably does not mean more than a few years ago,\u2014especially\nin conjunction with the preceding words \" when I was in my\nown country last.\" If he had been a child at the time, he\nwould probably have mentioned it ; but it does not seem\npossible now to obtain any further confirmation of the story,\nso that we can only print it as it stands.\nNOTICE.\nAN Associate of the Society, Mr. F.

One of its features of interest is that the\nwitness is exceptionally competent. The account was handed to\nme at a recent meeting of the Society by the Eev. William\nEoberts, of 76 Kensington Gardens Square, and it was written\nby an old student of my own at Bedford College in the seventies\n\u2014one of the ablest students there\u2014Miss C. M. Pole, daughter of\nthe late Dr. Pole, F.B.S., the well-known Engineer, Musician, and\nauthority on Whist. Miss Pole is now Mrs. Garrett Smith,\nliving at Magdeburg, and writes as follows :\u2014\nIn the early part of 1885 I was staying at in the house of\nMrs. Q., and I and her daughter, Miss Q., B.A. Lond., used to\namuse ourselves in writing with a Planchette. We had several\nPlanchettes (I think four), but we could only get response from\none of them, which belonged to Miss Q. In the house with us\nwere some eight or nine others, . . . but for no other pair would\nthe Planchette act, The same one had formerly given good results\nwith Miss Q. and another friend, but I have never written with\na Planchette before or since. We got all sorts of nonsense out of\nit, sometimes long doggerel rhymes with several verses. Sometimes\n\f310 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1904.\nwe asked for prophecies, but I do not remember ever getting one\nwhich came true, and my impression is that generally when we asked\nfor a prophecy the thing went off in a straight line\u2014running off the\ntable if we did not take our hands off. It often did this, refusing to\nwrite at all, and towards the end of my stay there I believe it was\nalways so ; we could get no answer from it. I believe we often asked\nPlanchette who the guiding spirit was ; but I only once remember\ngetting a definite connected answer. Then it wrote that his name was\n\"Jim,\" and that he had been a Senior Wrangler. After other\nquestions we asked it to write the equation to its own curve\n[in other words, to express mathematically the outline of the heart-\nshaped board]. Planchette wrote something like this quite distinctly\u2014\n(The curl backwards, always denoted that the answer was finished.)\nWe repeated the question several times, but each time the answer was\nthe same, sometimes more, sometimes less distinct. We interpreted\nit as r \u2014 \u2014~\u2014 Miss Q. had never done any work in Polar co\nordinates at all and did not know how to use them. I had about a\nyear previously done some elementary work with them when working\nfor the B.Sc. Exam., London University, and I knew just enough to\nbe able to draw the curve represented by the equation. In my first\ntry I made a mistake and believed the curve to be quite a different\none, but afterwards I drew the following, a double never-ending spiral :\n\fDEC., 1904. A Case of Automatic Intelligence. 311\nWe checked our result by taking the equation to the Mathematical\nMaster at the Boys' College, who drew the same curve for us, but we\ndid not tell him where we got the equation from. I cannot say\nwhether the Planchette we used was really exactly the shape of the\noutside curve ; I should rather fancy that with the heart shape the\nresemblance ended. I am quite sure that I had never seen the curve\nbefore, and therefore the production of the equation could not have\nbeen an act of unconscious memory on my part. Also I most certainly\ndid not know enough mathematics to know how to form an equation\nwhich would represent such a curve, or to know even of what type the\nequation must be. But I had come across snch equations and drawn\nthe curves represented by them\u2014for instance, afterwards I found in\nmy note-book the spiral rd = \u2014, and the cardioid r = a(l +cos &). We\nhad used no text-book, and in the full notes of the lectures I had\nattended, these were the two curves I found most similar to Plan-\nchette's. If my brain produced the equation written by Planchette, it\nmust have been that I unconsciously formed an equation like some I\nhad seen before, which by a curious coincidence chanced to represent\na heart-shaped curve.\nI know that we were both quite unconscious of any influence we\nmay have exercised on the Planchette.\nCECILIA GARRETT SMITH.\nMAGDEBURG, November, 1903.\nMr. Roberts wrote to Miss Q., sending her this account, and\nasking for her recollections of the incident, and she replies as\nfollows (asking us not to publish her full name and address).\nMarch 12th, 1904.\nThe planchette is not now in existence or I would make a sketch\nof it for you, but I remember distinctly that (1) there was a cusp\nat the dimple of the heart, and (2) that the curve at the other end\ncrossed the axis so that there was only one tangent at the point,\nand that one was perpendicular to the axis.\nThe rest of Mrs. Garrett Smith's account is substantially what I\nremember except in a few details.\n(1) I am described as not having done any work in Polar Co\nordinates and Miss Pole as having done only elementary work in\nthem. This was not the case\u2014I had taken my degree in Mathe\nmatics then, and used them freely, and so I think had Miss Pole.\nWhat I had not learnt to do was to trace curves from their\n\f312 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1904.\nequations, and it was for this reason that I could not test planchette's\nanswer. (2) I did not remember that Miss Pole had attempted to\ntrace the curve. . . .\nI (0. L.) made inquiries about Miss Q., and found that she\nwas well known to friends of mine, and was a serious and\nresponsible and trustworthy person, so I wrote some further\nquestions to her, and received the following reply :\u2014\nMarch 23rd, 1904.\n... As far as Miss Pole and I were concerned, it was quite bona-\nfidS, and was not open to any suspicion of practical joking or\nsetting traps for each other. It is true that when we wrote planchette,\nit was never with any serious motive, such as with the object of\ntesting the unconscious mind, or for any scientific purpose, but\nmerely for the fun of the thing. We used to ask it to prophesy\nfuture events, and to make up poetry, and all purely for amusement,\nafter the manner of schoolgirls. Nevertheless, all that was written\nwas quite in good faith.\nThe equation written did not come within the mathematical\nknowledge I then possessed, which was limited to the mathematics\nnecessary for the London B.A. Pass Degree. I knew of course that\nevery curve could be represented by an equation, and I was familiar\nwith polar co-ordinates in which the equation was written. But the\nonly equations I could then identify were those of the conic sections.\nMiss Pole had read some elementary Differential, and knew more\nthan I did, but my impression is that her knowledge was not\nsufficient to enable her to trace curves.\nCertainly neither of us perceived from the appearance of the\nequation that the reply was the correct one, but that I think would\nhave been too much to expect, even if our knowledge had been\nmuch higher than it was.\nI did not know sufficient at that time to attempt to plot the\ncurve. I believe Miss Pole did attempt it, but if so, her attempts\nwere unsuccessful. We were not satisfied that the equation did\nrepresent a curve like the outline of the planchette till we had\nasked our mathematical master to trace it for us. (This was done\nwithout telling him any of the facts of the case.)\nI do not remember that we ever closely compared the curve he\ndrew in tracing the equation with the actual planchette in question.\nWe did not take the matter very seriously, and were quite content\nwhen we saw that the solution was at all events approximately true.\n\fDEC., 1904. A Case of Automatic Intelligence. 313\nOn now tracing the curve represented by the equation, I am\ninclined to think that it very closely resembles the shape of the\nactual planchette used, from my memory of it. (The planchette is\nno longer in existence.) . . .\nConcerning these statements, it is, as Mrs. Garrett Smith says,\nunfortunate that the actual shape of the Planchette board was\nnot recorded ; so that there is no means now of ascertaining in\nwhat way the curve met the horizontal axis, whether there ought\nto be a cusp at the dimple of the heart, and especially whether\nthe longer branches of the curve are continuous, or, as in the sketch\nshe first made, intersect the axis at about 45\u00b0. If the sketch is\ncorrect in this particular,1 the equation given is not; for the curve\nrepresented by the equation would cross the axis normally. The\nequation which would naturally occur to any one is the cardioid\nr = a(l -(-cos 0); but it is quite likely, as Mrs. Garrett Smith\nsays, that although as a student she was undoubtedly aware of\nthis curve, she might not, some years afterward, be able to repro\nduce it on demand.\nThe equation written by Planchette is not a familiar one\nand certainly would not be likely to occur to her, nor would\nit have occurred to me ; it may possibly represent the actual\noutline of the board better than a cardioid or than some other\nof the equations which are written below, but it does not appear\nto represent the rough sketch exceptionally well.\nI asked my brother, Alfred Lodge, Professor of Pure Mathe\nmatics at the Eoyal Indian Engineering College, Coopers Hill, to\nsuggest an equation that fitted the sketch, and he suggested\nr = a#2, and r= 2(10*\/ir\u2014 1), both of which seem to me better to\nrepresent the sketch than either a cardioid or the Planchette\nequation. He also suggested a series, expanding r in powers of 0,\nwhich comes to very much the same thing as the Planchette equation.\nHence I think it may be said,\u2014giving it the benefit of some\ndoubt as to the actual shape of the board, on the ground that\nwhen Miss Pole drew the curve her recollection is that it agreed\nmoderately well with the real outline,\u2014that the equation written\nby Planchette is not unworthy of a mathematician, and I should\nagree with Mrs. Garrett Smith in considering it distinctly beyond\nher normal power of rapid suggestion under the circumstances.\n1 Mrs. Garrett Smith explained later that her rough sketch was incorrect in this\npoint, the loiiger branches of the curve beiug continuous, and the diagram given\nabove is corrected accordingly.\n\f314 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 19M.\nWhen I asked my brother to suggest a curve to correspond\nto a heart-shaped board, I sent him nothing but the outline of\nMrs. Garrett Smith's sketch, and did not tell him any of the\ncircumstances. Afterwards I supplied him with the information\nand he wrote again as follows :\u2014\n\" It is a pity the exact shape of the Planchette was not traced.\nPerhaps all planchettes are the same shape ? The cardioid\nr = a (1 -f cos 0) is better in a sense than r = a . as the latter\nu\ngoes through the origin and twirls away for ever, whereas the\ncardioid stops there in a cusp. But IF the exact shape of the\nplanchette were known it might be that \u2014^\u2014 fits it better\nthan a (1 + cos 0).\nI may say that the f \u00a3>A^ angle at A put me off such a\nsolution as \u2014g-, although it had gone through my mind that a\n(7\nseries of powers of 6 would be useful to try. I tried getting the\ncusp when $\u2022= 0, letting the angle at A take care of itself.\nA.

Motor Impulse.\nThe following case has been received from a correspondent\nin New Zealand. As she has requested us not to give the\nnames of the persons concerned, (all of which have been\ncommunicated to us privately), assumed names are substituted\nfor the real ones throughout the narrative, and we call the\nnarrator Miss Butler. She writes as follows :\nMarch 30th, 1904.\nSix years ago I was living with my father and a sister and\nbrother on a farm, 5 miles from the nearest township and about 60\nmiles from Wellington. My friend, Miss Wilson, was living here\nin Wellington with her mother, and Miss Wilson and I kept up a\nregular correspondence. One morning I awoke very early and felt\na strong desire to write a story. I sat up in bed and began at\nonce. I finished it at about noon, and when my sister asked me\nto read it aloud to her, I said I could not, as the idea was so\npainful, and that I had put Mrs. Wilson in as one of the characters\nand that she died of cancer. I felt very depressed. Of course, as\nfar as any of us knew, Mrs. Wilson was quite well and we had\nnever associated this disease with her. Nevertheless I wished I\nhad not written the story. This happened on a Sunday, and on\nthe next day I received a long letter from Miss Wilson telling me\nthat her mother had been operated on successfully on the preced\ning day (Sunday) at noon for cancer. She explained that she and\nher mother had known of the necessity for the operation for 10\ndays before, and that she had written me a letter telling me of it\nas soon as she knew, but that her mother bad persuaded her to\n\f316 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1904.\ndestroy the letter, because of our living so far from the post and\ntelegraph office, and because our mails were so irregular. Mrs.\nWilson was a thoughtful woman and knew that we would be very\nnervous, and had no means of communicating quickly with them. Miss\nWilson therefore had written just as regularly as usual, but had given\nus no idea that anything was amiss. A fortnight later Mrs. Wilson died.\nMost of my intimate friends know of this incident, and up till\nquite recently I possessed the manuscript. My sister and my brother\nknew I had written it, before we had even heard Mrs. Wilson was ill.\nTo the whole of the narrative, another extract from which\nis given below, the following note is attached :\nMarch 30th, 1904.\nWe have read the paper written by my sister for the S. P. K.\nand wish to say that the occurrences took place in the order in\nwhich she has described them. M. BUTLEU (sister).\nM. WILSON.\nMiss Wilson writes further :\nJune 29tt, 1904.\nI read your letter to Miss Butler, and am going to give you as\nclearly as I can an account of my mother's illness and death, both\nof which are still so vivid in my mind that they might have\noccurred just the other day.\nOn July the 3rd, 1897, I came home in the evening from having\ngiven my music lessons, and my mother told me that she had seen\nDr. A . I had asked her to see him on account of her having\ncomplained of something being the matter with her foot. I don't\nremember what it was, but nothing serious. She had put off doing\nthis for some time, and I afterwards found that her reason for\ndoing this was because she feared that she had cancer, as she\nhad noticed a peculiar lump in her breast, and she dreaded\nthe doctor confirming her fears. It seems that she had noticed it\nsome months previously, but as we had a lady suffering from the\nsame complaint staying with us at the time, she (my mother) had\nnot said anything about it even to me, and as she suffered no pain\nwhatever, but was apparently in her usual good health, I suppose\nshe hoped it was her imagination, and that the lump perhaps would\ndisappear. At any rate, neither I nor any one else had the least\nidea that anything was the matter with her. Well, when Dr.\nA came that day she summoned up courage to ask him about\nit, and he was very horrified and distressed to find that she was\nright. He said there must be an operation as soon as possible.\n\fDBC., 1904. Cases. 317\nTwo other doctors, Dr. C and Dr. F , were called in con\nsultation, and they all three agreed that there was no reason to\nsuppose that the operation would be anything but successful.\nDirectly I knew about it I naturally wanted to let my friend\u2014a\nfriend of over twenty-five years\u2014know about it, and ray mother,\nknowing I would write at once and tell her, begged me not to do\nso until it was over, for she said she knew what a dreadful shock\nit would be to her, and also that living away in the country,\u2014out\nof reach of telegrams, and where the mails were not regular or\nalways easy to get,\u2014both she and her sister and brother would have\nsuch an anxious time. I therefore did not mention the fact or\neven hint in any of my letters that there was anything wrong, but\njust wrote as usual. On Sunday morning, July 19th, 1897, my\nmother was operated on for cancer, and when this was over I wrote\nto my friend and told her everything. I knew it would be a great\nshock to her, for when she had seen my mother last\u2014in May I\nthink it was\u2014she was, for all we knew, perfectly well and just as\nbright as ever she had been. For the fortnight following the\noperation everything went on in the most satisfactory way possible.\nThere were no relapses of any kind, but on the afternoon of\nMonday, August 3rd, there seemed to be a sudden collapse, and at\nabout twelve o'clock that night she died. I telegraphed to Miss\nButler, and she came to me at once. I do not remember if Miss\nButler wrote and told me during the fortnight following the\noperation, or whether she told me after my mother's death, that\non the morning of July 19th she had waked up very early and\ntold her sister that she felt she wanted to write a little story,\nthat the plot was a most unpleasant one, but that she felt she\nmust write it down, and then perhaps she would get it off her\nmind. Her sister, Miss M. Butler, said that she would get the break\nfast while Miss Butler wrote the story. When it was finished, she\nsaid she would like either to read it or tell it to Miss M. I do\nnot know which she did, but at any rate one of the chief characters\nin the story was my mother, and the story was being written on the\nexact day and at the exact time of the operation, and Miss Butler\nknew nothing from me as far as we knew, nor could she have\nheard from any one else, for we told no one that everything was\nnot as usual. On the Monday morning she had my letter telling her my\nreasons for having kept from her the knowledge of what was impending.\nI know for a fact that the story was written on that morning,\nand I have no doubt that her sister,\u2014who is in the country, but\n\f318 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC.,\nwho, I believe, is writing to you by this mail,\u2014will tell you the\nsame. M. WILSON.\nP.S.\u2014This letter was written without any consultation with or\nappeal to either Miss Butler or any one else, and is just what I\nremember of the case.\nA number of letters of condolence received by Miss Wilson\nafter the death of her mother were also sent to us. These\nconfirm independently the date of the death, and several of\nthem refer to the extreme suddenness of the illness. Miss\nButler's sister writes further:\nJuly I3lh, 1904.\n... I am sorry I cannot give you any further details of her\nwriting about Mrs. Wilson's cancer just before she had heard that\nMrs. Wilson was suffering from it; and as I have already corrobo\nrated my sister's statement of the case, perhaps that is all you\nrequire.\nIn the remainder of Miss Butler's narrative, she describes\nseveral other experiences,\u2014some apparently subjective halluci\nnations or impressions, and some apparently premonitory visions\nrelating to the death of her father, then aged about 86. She\nalso describes a course of self-suggestion, from which her\nhealth greatly benefitted, as follows:\nShortly after Mrs. Wilson's death I came to live with Miss\nWilson, and a little over two years ago the Vicar of our Church\nlent us a book\u2014\"Psychic Phenomena\"\u2014by -Hudson. We found it\nvery interesting, and attempted some thought-reading experiments\nwith cards. We failed, and gradually the author's ideas faded from\nour minds.\nAll my life I have suffered from indigestion, sick headaches,\nrelaxed throats, etc. I had got into the habit of taking two or\nthree pills every night, and my diet was painfully restricted. I\nwas afraid to eat anything but the plainest food, and my weight\n(I am 5 ft. 6 ins. about) was 8 stone.\nItbegan to worry more than usual over this state of things, and\nthen the idea came to me that I might give Hudson's theory a trial.\nI had no faith\u2014at least I was not conscious of any\u2014but I told\nmyself it would not hurt me to give it a three months' trial, and\nthat if I failed I would be no worse off. So I began.\nFor, say, three weeks I saw and felt no improvement in my\nhealth that I could feel justified in putting down to mental sug\n\fDEC., 1904. Cases. 319\ngestion, but after that, I began to realise that my sore throats did\nsomehow seem less frequent. My headaches were more persistent,\nbut still they came less often, and finally I realised that I could eat\npractically anything, as long as I made a point of eating practically\nanything ! I began this course eighteen months ago about, and for\na year or a little more I have not taken any medicine. I am much\nfatter, and in fact am a different woman. My method as regards\nself-suggestion is as follows: Three or four times during the day I\nwalked up and down in the privacy of my own room, repeating aloud\na formula which I seldom varied, in which moral, mental and physical\ntraits which I felt the need of were insisted on. I did not believe\nin the efficacy of this treatment one bit,\u2014I just made myself do\nit,\u2014but I felt most of the time that it was extremely ridiculous, and\nI had an uneasy inward feeling that it might end in my going insane.\nI used also to lie down every morning an hour before one o'clock\ndinner and repeat the suggestions again. I always lay on my back\nand gazed at the ceiling.\nEver since I was a child\u2014I am now 47\u2014I have been liable at\nintervals, and seemingly unconnected with my health, to a sort\nof nervous terror, generally at night, but also coming on at any\ntime during the day. These attacks are less frequent than they\nused to be, and I have learned latterly to control them. That is to\nsay, though they come, I am not overcome by them. Within the\nlast eighteen months I have gained, by [the methods of mental sug\ngestion just described], a strange control over them which is difficult\nto explain, but which is as if\u2014while on the surface my nerves and\nheart and sensations are all throbbing with fear\u2014there is a perfectly\nquiet and calm spot underneath it all. I tma like a pool of water,\nall of which was lashed about, and now I am more like the sea,\nwhich is only lashed on the top. I am not attempting to be\npoetical. . . .\nIt must be observed, however, that some of the obviously\nsubjective hallucinations above referred to occurred during the\nprocess of self-suggestion ; also Miss Butler describes two\noccasions on which she suffered a severe attack of nervous\nunreasoning terror after attempting the experiment of in\nfluencing a person at a distance according to the method\nprescribed by Hudson.\nWith regard to the improvement in her health (of which\nshe was not able to send us any evidence from a medical man,\nsince she had bad no medical treatment for it) her sister writes :\n\f320 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1904.\nJuly 13th, 1904.\n... I can only say that the alteration in her health is wonderful ; she\nnever suffers from nervous headache, indigestion, or sore-throat now,\nthough she was seldom free from one or other of them before. She\nis able to eat everything, no matter how rich, and nothing disagrees\nwith her as it did when she was dieting herself.\nMiss Wilson also writes on the same subject in the letter\nquoted from above, as follows :\nAs to Miss Butler's health. All I can say is that what she\nwrote to you is absolutely true. She has, ever since I have known\nher, taken medicine constantly; in fact, as far as I can remember,\nshe has taken it every night, and always increasing the doses. A\nyear after my mother died she came to live with me for good, so I\nwas a personal witness to the increase of these doses. Then we\nbegan to be very interested in reading of telepathy, hypnotism, sug\ngestion, etc., and she determined that she would try suggestion to\ncure herself of the habit of having to take medicine at all. She\nwent into all the details of this, I think, in her letter to you, and I\ncan only verify her statement, both with regard to that complaint\nand also what she said about her food. When first she came to me,\nshe could not eat this and she could not eat that without having a\nsick headache, or something of the sort. Now she eats anything she\nfancies, and never has to wonder what will be the results. This, I\nbelieve, she accomplished by saying to herself that there was no\nreason why she should not be able to eat such and such a thing,\nfor she was perfectly healthy, and it would not disagree with her,\nand it didn't. I cannot remember when she last had a headache,\nand her sore throats, which used to be very frequent and also very\nsevere, she has disposed of in the same way, and she never now\nhas to take medicine. She has gained considerably in weight since\npractising this suggestion, and is quite a different woman to when\nshe first came to live with me. M. WILSON.\nL. 1141. Collective Auditory.\nThe first account of this case was sent to us by an\nHonorary Associate, Mr. J. F. Young, of Llanelly, South Wales,\nand the evidence was completed by the efforts of the llev. A.\nT. Fryer, of Cardiff. The account sent by Mr. Young was as follows:\nLLANISHEN, CARDIFF, October 22nd, 1904.\nThe following narrative was communicated to me by Mrs. Page\nof Caerphilly, a lady whose intelligence and high character render the\n\fDie., 1904. Cases. 321\naccount, I venture to think, of special value. Mrs. Page is the inven\ntor of a valuable ointment. A young man living in the district had\nbeen in the habit of using this ointment for his chest. He, however,\nwas consumptive, and though he had great faith in the efficacy of\nthe ointment, it was evident it could be of no material use, and, indeed,\ndespite his doctor's care, he grew worse and worse. On the early\nmorning of the 21st December, 1903, about 3 o'clock a.m., Mrs. Page\nwas in bed, when she was awakened by steps coming up the stairs,\nfollowed by sharp knocking at her bedroom door. This was also\nheard by relatives sleeping in an adjoining room. She jumped up,\nwent to the door and out into the passage, but there was no one there.\nIn the course of the day she learnt that the young man had died at\nthe very time she heard the above. He was most eager to see Mrs.\nPage, and had implicit faith in her remedy up to the last. This is the\nreal statement of fact, but Mrs. Page will gladly answer any ques\ntion that may be put to her on the subject. I may add that she\nis a strong woman mentally and physically, possessed- of abundance\nof common-sense, and not in the least superstitious.\nARTHUR MEE,\n(Assistant Editor Western Mail).\nThe above is perfectly true.\nNov. 5th, 1904. GKORGIANA PAGE.\nMr. Fryer, having kindly undertaken to inquire into the case,\nwrote first to Mrs. Page, and received the following reply :\nCAERPHILLY, Nov. 4lh, 1904.\n. . . When I heard the three hard knocks at my bedroom door, it never\nstruck me that Daniel Morgan was dead, until I saw his sister-in-law\nopen my gate at 9 o'clock [the] same morning, when I turned quite\ncold.

ELIZA MORGAN.\nMr. Fryer also had an interview with Mrs. Page about the\ncase and was very favourably impressed by her as a witness.\nShe told him of another apparently veridical experience con\nnected with the death of a relative ; but this had occurred\nover twenty years ago, and no evidence of it seems to be\nnow obtainable. With regard to the case now in question,\nMrs. Page wrote further to Mr. Fryer :\nCAERPHILLY, GLAM., Nov. 12th, 1904.\nThree of my daughters heard the footsteps coming up the stairs\nand going straight to my bedroom door, and knocking three times.\nThe eldest only .ventured out to see who was there, after hearing\nme call.

Cases. 323\nL. 1142. Impression.\nThe following case of possible telepathy from a dog was also sent\nto us by Mr. J. F. Young, of New Road, Llanelly, South Wales.\nNEW ROAD, LLANELLY, Nov. \\Wi, 1904.\nI own a rough terrier, about 5 years old, which I have brought\nup from a pup. I have always been a great lover of animals, dogs\nespecially. This dog returns my affection so much that I never go\nanywhere, not even leave the room, but he must follow me. He is\ndeath on rats, and the scullery being visited occasionally by these\nrodents, I have a comfortable bed for Fido to sleep on. In this room\nthere is a fire-place with an oven suitable for baking, and a boiler for\nwashing, with a flue running back into the chimney (as sketch) [not\nreproduced here]. It was my custom to take him to his bed the last\nthing before retiring for the night. I had undressed and was\nabout getting into bed, when an unaccountable feeling came over\nme of impending danger. I could think of nothing possible but\nFire, and the impression was so strong that I yielded to it and\nactually dressed again, and went downstairs and examined each\nroom to satisfy myself that all was right. When I got to the scul\nlery I missed Fido, and thinking he had slipped by me unobserved\nto go upstairs, I immediately began to call him, but getting no\nresponse, I called to my sister-in-law to know if she had heard him,\nand getting an answer in the negative, I began to feel excited, and\nrushed back to the scullery again, and called repeatedly, but not a\nsound could be heard. What to do I did not know. It then\noccurred to me that if anything will get him to respond it will be\nthe sentence, \" Come for a walk, Fido,\" which always gave him\ndelight. As soon as I had repeated this sentence, I heard a faint\ncry, muffled as if distant ; calling again, the cry of a dog in dis\ntress came plainly. I eventually traced it to the flue at * [a point\nmarked in the sketch], where the flue uniting the boiler with chim\nney runs. For the moment I could not think how I could get\nhim out; moments were precious, life was in danger. I took a\npickaxe and soon tore down a portion of the wall, when with some\ndifficulty I drew him out half-dead, panting, vomiting, tongue and\nbody black with soot ; my pet would soon have been dead, and as\nthe boiler is only used occasionally, I should never have known\nwhat had become of him. Hearing the noise my sister-in-law came\nto the scene. We found a rat-hole in the fireplace which led to\nthe flue. Fido had evidently chased the rat into the flue and could\nnot turn or retreat. . . . This occurred a few months ago and\nwas reported at the time in our local paper, but I never thought of\nsending it to you until I read the Rider Haggard story.\nJ. F.

As suggested by you I will give you a few\nmore particulars relating to this. I think you will at once see\nthe utter impossibility of any sounds reaching me, unless they had\nbeen very loud, and even then my sister-in-law, who sleeps nearer\nthe dog than I do, would have noticed it. In fact she enquired\nas I was crossing the landing to go down, where I was going;\nwhen I replied that \"I felt as if something was going to happen,\nand feared it might be fire.\" I may here remark that as I passed\nfrom room to room, I began to accuse myself for being so silly\nas to imagine any danger. However, I went on looking for some\nthing, not having the slightest idea of what to expect. From that\ntime, until I read Rider Haggard's dream, I put it down to an\nintelligence outside myself that had prompted me to go down.\nThe telepathic theory now takes its place, especially taking into\nconsideration the devotion of the dog, for, if possible, he will not\nallow me out of his sight, and in my absence is quite a different dog. . . .\nIn reply to query (1), Yes. I took him, as I always do, to\nhis bed the last thing [before going] the round of the rooms and\ndoors to see that all is safe. I (2) also enclose a sketch, in section,\nwhich will give you an idea as to our positions. (3) I never\nheard any sounds, and neither could I get any after repeated\nwhistling and calling, until I called him to go for a walk, and that\nwas so faint I could not at first localise it. You will observe\nthe position of the dog was actually the furthest [from me] that\ncould be in the house. ... J. F. YOUNG.\nIn this letter and a later one, Mr. Young enclosed rough plans\nof his house, showing his bedroom at the front, and on the\nopposite side of the house from the scullery, which is at the\nback. The bedroom is on the first floor and the scullery\nin the basement, the ground floor intervening between them.\nThere were also three doors, all shut and locked, between\nthe interiors of the two rooms, namely, the doors of the rooms\nthemselves and a third door at the top of the lowest flight\nof stairs leading down to the basement. Under these circum\nstances, it is very difficult to suppose that Mr. Young could\nhave heard any sounds from the dog imprisoned in the .flue.\n\fNOTICES.\nMEETINGS.\nParticulars of the next Meetings of the Council and of the Society will\nbe given in the Journal for January.\nISSUE OF PROCEEDINGS..\nPart XLIX. of the Proceedings, completing Vol. XVIII., contain*\narticles by Dr. Albert Wilson on a Case of Multiple Personality ; by\nMr. F.

MILNE BRAMWELL, M.B., C.M.\n8\u00bbo. 478 pages. 18s. net.\nThe chief aim of this monograph is to draw the attention of medical men\nto the therapeutic value of Hypnotism. The author gives the results of\ntwelve years of his own practice and research, with personal observations\nof the work done in France, Germany, Sweden, Holland, Switzerland, and\nBelgium.\nThe historical part of the book is specially devoted to the comparatively\nlittle known work of the English pioneers, Elliotson, Esdaile, and Braid,\n\u2022while the final chapter of references contains much information which has\nnot hitherto been published in accessible form.\nThe methods of inducing Hypnotism are exhaustively dealt with and\ninstructions given in regard to the management of the hypnotic state, with\ndetails as to the causes of susceptibility to hypnosis. Hypnotic theories are\ndescribed and discussed, and special prominence is given to Mr. Myers's\ntheory of the subliminal consciousness and the light thrown by it on the\nproblems of hypnotism.\nGRANT RICHARDS, 48 LEICESTER SQUARE, LONDON, W.C.\n\fTHE JOURNAL.\nThe early numbers of the JOURNAL having now been reprinted, it can b\u00ab\nobtained, bound in cloth, as under, by Members and Associates :\u2014\nVol. I.
