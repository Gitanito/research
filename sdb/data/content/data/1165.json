That the fame afpecl: and method of \u00b7\ncalculating may be found in more of the like,\nwhen alledged as proofs, is rhe greaceft evi-\ndence of the truth of the matter; for it might\nbe argued, that one example would perhaps\nonly agree~ __\n3.

I have not taken remarkable ef.fc:8:s\nfrom the fixed ftars, as many do, and truly\nwithout foundation, but from the erratics r\nthough the ftars fixed, fpecify and afford fame\nlittle affiftance to the power of the erratics.\n5. In all thefe examples, the proportion I\nhave found of the .arc of direcl:ion correfponds .\nwith the years of an age.\n6. 1 have not varied the time of the nativi-\nties to tnake the calculations of the direcl:ions\nagree ; but if in any example I have made ~\nlittle alteration, it is very fn1all, and fcarce\nmakes any difference on the arc of direction\nof the luminaries, whether direct or converfe,\nexcept only in the mundane parallels. How-\n.\never, fron1 this fmall alteration, it may be in-\nferred, that either on that account the time is\nreduced to a true one, or, at leaft, that the di-\nB 2 reB:ions\n\fh T O T H E Jl E A D E R:\n.. recl:ions of the para-lids inI tqe~world were\nnot fur difrant, and might, notwithfl:anding,\nhave been of very good ufe, though there\nwere no change of rime in the nativity; for\nevery direction c.iufosan alteration in bodies;\nbut the full effect plainly appears.i by means\nof the powtrfu l direttions which arrive fir.ft,\nand the fubfequent aflift more. or lefs, ac-\ncording as t~e proxitnity of tfie application\nor virtuai influx\u00b7 is greater or lefs : but no\ncredit is to be given to the tim~ of thofe na-\ntivities, in which authors have adopted the\nhorofcope ,for the giver of life, \u2022where the\nluminaries, &c. ought to have been tak\/n;\nI .\nfor we may rcafonably conclude, that wh<:,n\nthe\nfaid authors have not found their direcl:ionsof\ntliat luminary to w hiuh,t1ndoubtedly belonged\nthe power of life, to agree with die effects,\nthey havt: rn::idea confiderable alteration in the\nappointed\u00b7ti~e of the nativity, in order that\nthey might bring down the borofcope to any\nafpecl: of the planets: I can ~ffirn1 what I\n}~avefaid to be true, \u00b7for in my youth I faw\nfeveral carivities, afi:erwardspublifhed by the\n:..uthors, wherein was :L vifible aitctration in\n.. .. the\n{\nf\nf\nl\n\f\f14 'I.:0 T H E R E A D E JL\naffiftance, &c, yet each direction muft always\n, be confu1ted and calculate9, agreeably to the\ntwo kinds of afpecl:s.\n9, You may know chat thofe nat1v1t1esarc\n{hanger, when another ,luminary becomes\nthe fign~ficator, by rneans of the duplicate\nmotion of the prorogation, which does n\u25cat\nhappen when the horo1cope of the country is\nthe giver of life, for it only performs m a\nright motion1 and not conyerfe.\n.
