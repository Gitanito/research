But\nthey were great Masters of the sublime\nScience of being content with simple\nNature, of despising Death for the\nLove of their Country, and of flying\nall Pleasures which emasculate the\nMind, and enervate the Body.\nThe Youth were educated in pub-\nlick Schools, where they were early\ninstructed in the Knowledge of the\nLaws, and accustom'd to hear Causes,\npass Sentence, and mutually to do\none another Justice 5 and hereby they\ndiscovered their Dispositions, Penetra\ntion, and Capacity for Employments\nin a riper Age.\nThe Virtues which their Masters\nwere principally careful to inspire,\nwere Truth and Goodness, Sobriety\nand Obedience. The two former\nmake us resemble the Gods 5 the two\nlatter\n\fThe Travels o\/Cyrus.\n\\\nlatter are necessary to the Preserva\ntion of Order. *\nThe chief Aim of the Laws in\nantient Perjia, was to prevent the\nCorruption of the Heart: And for\nthis Reason, the 'Persians punisii'd\nIngratitude, a Vice against which\nthere is no Provision made by the\nLaws of other Nations. Whoever\nwas capable of forgetting a Benefit,\nor of refusing to do a good Office\nwhen it was in his Power, was looked\nupon as an Enemy to Society.\nCyrus had been educated according\nto these wise Maxims. And though\nit was impossible to conceal from him\nhis Rank and Condition, yet he was\ntreated like the rest ofhis Companions,\nand with the same Severity as if he\nhad. not been born to reign. He was\ntaught to practise an exact Obedience,\n* Xenoph. Cyrop.

The Love of\nGlory, strict Probity, severe Honour,\nwere no longer in Esteem. Solid\nKnowledge was looked upon as con\ntrary to Delicacy ofManners. Agree\nable Trifling, fine-spun Thoughts, and\nlively Sallies of Imagination, were\nthe only Kinds of Wit admired there.\nNo sort of Writings pleas'd, but\namusing Fictions 5 where a perpetual\nSuccession ofEvents surprized by their\nVariety, without improving the Un\nderstanding, or enobiing the Heart.\nLove was without Delicacy. Blind\nPleasure was its only attractive Charm.\nThe Women thought themselves de\nspised when no Attempts were made\nto ensnare them. That which con\ntributed to encrease this Corruption\nof Mind, Manners, and Sentiments,\nwas the new Doctrine, spread every\nwhere by the Magi, That 'Pleasure\nB 4 is\n\f8 (she Travels of Cyrus.\n,f m\nis the only moving Spring of Mans;\nHeart. For as each Man was free to\nplace his Pleasure according to his\nFancy, this Maxim authorized Virtue\nor Vice according to every one's Taste,\nHumour, or Complexion.\nThis Depravity, however, was not\nthen so universal in Media, as it be-\ni *' came afterwards under the Reigns of\nArtaxerxes and 'Darius Codomanus.\nCorruption takes its Rise in Courts,\nand extends itself gradually thro' all\n.\u00bb ' \". I the Parts of a State. There were in\nthe Provinces, and in the Troops,\nseveral military Men who were not\ncorrupted by the infectious Air of\nEchatana, but had preserv'd in them\nselves all the Virtues which flourish'd\nin the Reigns of Demes and ^hra-\nortes.\nMandana was throughly sensible of\nall the Dangers to which she should\nexpose young Cyrus, by carrying him\nto\n\fThe Travels o\/Cyrus.\nto a Court, the Manners ofwhich were\nso different from those of the Ter-\nJians. But the Will ofCambyfes, and\nthe Orders of djlyages, obliged her\nto undertake the Journey.\nShe set out, attended by a Body\nofthe young Nobility of 'Persia, un\nder the Command of Hyftaspes, to\nwhom the Education of Cyrus had\nbeen committed. She was in a Cha\nriot with her Son, and it was the\nfirst time he had seen himself distin\nguish'd from his Companions.\nMandana was a Princess of un\ncommon Virtue. Her Mind was cul\ntivated and adorned, and she had a\nGenius much above her Sex. She\nmade it her Business, during the Jour\nney, to inspire Cyrus with the Love\nof Virtue, by entertaining him with\nFables according to the Eastern Man\nner. The Minds of young Persons\nare\n\flo The Travels os Cyrus.\nare not gained by difficult and refined\nReasonings, they must be enticed by\nagreeable and familiar Images. To\nmake Truth lovely to them, it must\nbe exhibited by sensible and beautiful\nRepresentations.\nMandana had observed that 'Cyrus\nwas often too full of himself, and\nthat he discovered some Tokens of a\nrising Vanity, which might one Day\nobscure his great Qualities. She en\ndeavoured to make him sensible of\nthe Deformity of that Vice, by re\nlating to him the Fable of Sozares,\na Prince of the antient Empire of\nAjfyria It resembles the Story of\nthe Grecian Narciffhs, who perished\nby the foolish Love of himself. For\nthus it is that the Gods punish 5 they\nonly give us over to our own Passi\nons, and we immediately commence\nUnhappy.\ntfj-^ I ,<\u25a0 She\n\fThe Travels p\/ Cyrus. \\\\\nShe then painted to him the Beauty\nof those noble Virtues which lead to\nHeroism, by the generous forgetting\nofoneWelf. She related to him the\nFable of the first Hermes, a divine\nYouth, who was beautiful without\nknowing it, had Wit without think\ning so, and who was unacquainted\nwith his own Virtue, because he was\nignorant that there were Vices.\nIt was thus that Mandana instruct\ned her Son during the Journey 5 one\nFable gave Rise to another. The\nQuestions of the Prince furnished the\nQueen with new Matter to entertain\nhim, and with Opportunities of teach\ning him the Sense of the Egyptian\nFables, the Taste for which had pre\nvailed very much in the Eafl, since \/,\nthe Conquests of Sefejiris. {\nAs they passed one Day by a\nMountain, consecrated to the great\nOroma%es,\n\fii The Travels os Cyrus.\nOromazes*, Mandana stopp'd her\nChariot, alighted, and drew near to the\nsacred Place. It was the Day of a so\nlemn Festival, and the High Priest was\nalready preparing the Victim, crown'd\nwith Flowers. He was of a sudden\nseiz'd with a Divine Spirit, and inter\nrupting the Silence and Solemnity of\nthe Sacrifice, cryed out in a Trans\nport 5 \/ fee a young Laurel rising.\nIt will soon spread its Branches over\nall the East. The Nations will come\nin Crowds to assemble together under\nits Shadow. At the very same In\nstant a Spark of Fire flew out from\nthe Pile, and moved about the Head\nof Cyrus.\nMandana made deep Reflections\nupon this Event, and after she was\nagain in her Chariot, said to her Son,\nThe Gods sometimes fend these Au\nguries to animate Heroick Souls : They\n* The great God of the Persians.

He\nwas a Prince of great Beneficence and\nHumanity, but his natural Goodness\nmade him often too Easy, and his\nPropensity to Pleasure had brought\nthe Medes into the Taste of Luxury\nand Effeminacy *.\nCyrus, soon aster his Arrival at\nthe Court of Echatana, gave Proofs\nof a Wit and Judgment far beyond\nhis Age. J\nstyages put divers Ques\ntions to him concerning the Manners,\nLaws, and Method ofeducating Youth\namong the cPerfians. He was struck\nwith Astonishment at the lively and\n* Xenoph. Cyrop. B. i.

A secret Pre\nsumption steals into his Heart. He\ntalks a little too much, and does not\nhearken enough to others. He de\ncides with an Air of Sufficiency, and\nseems too fond of Wit.\nMandana, to remedy this Fault,\ncontrived. to set before him his own\nPicture, by certain Passages of His\ntory 5 for she still proceeded in his\nEducation, upon the same Plan on\nwhich flie had begun it. She related to\nhim the Story of Logis and Sygeus.\nc My Son, said she, it was for-\nc merly the Custom at Thebes, in\nc B\u0153otia, to raise to the Throne, af-\n* ter the Death of the King, him, of\n' all his Children, who had the best\nc Parts. When a Prince has fine Parts\n' he can chuse able Ministers, make\ni proper\n\f'The Travels of Cyh us< tf\nproper Use of their Talents, and\ngovern those who govern under\nhim. This is the great Secret of\nthe Art of Reigning.\nc Among the King's Sons there\nwere two who discovered a supe-\nriour Genius. The elder loved\nTalking, the younger was more\nsilent. The eloquent Prince, named\nLogh, made himself admired by\nthe Charms of his Wit. The silent\nPrince, named Sygeus, made him\nself loved by the Goodness of his\nHeart. The first fhew'd plainly,\neven while he endeavoured to con\nceal it, that he spoke only to shine.\nThe second hearkned readily to\nothers, and looked upon Conversa\ntion, as a sort of Commerce, where\neach Person ought to bring some\nthing of his own. The one made\nthe most thorny and perplexed Af\nfairs agreeable by a peculiar Grace\nin the manner of treating them :\n' The\n\f\\6 The Travels of CtRus.-\n* The other threw Light upon the otv\nc Icurest Points, by reducing every\n1 Thing to simple Principles. Logis\n1 affected Mystery without being se-\nc cret, and his Politicks were full of\nc Stratagems and Artifices. Sygeus\n1 had Address without Falshood, and\n\u00a3 great Penetration, while he was\n* himselfimpenetrable. He surmount-\n' ed all Obstacles by his Prudence\nc and Courage, and by pursuing\n1 steadily the most just and noble\n' Views.\n1 After the King's Death, the Peo-\nc pie were assembled in a large En-\n1 closure to chuse a Successor to the\n1 Throne. Twelve old Men presided\nc at their Council to correct the Judg-\n' ment of the Multitude, who sel-\ni dom sail to be carry'd away by\nc Prejudice, Appearances, or Passion.\n' The eloquent Prince made a long,\n' but fine Harangue, wherein he set\n' forth all the Duties of a King, in\n1 order\n\fThe Travels of Cyrus. \\y\n' order to insinuate that one who was\nc so well acquainted withthem, would\n' undoubtedly fulfil them.

The two\nBrothers applauded the Proposal for\nPeace, and Logis mounted the\nThrone. He changed, in a little\ntime, all the antient Laws of the\nKingdom, was always listening to\nnew Projects 5 and to have a lively\nImagination was sufficient to raise\na Man to the highest Employments.\nThat which seemed excellent in\nSpeculation could not be executed\nbut with Difficulty and Confusion.\nI His\n\fThe Travels of Cyrus. 19\nc\nHis Ministers, who had no Expe\nrience, knew not that precipitate\nChanges, how useful soever they\nmay appear, are always dangerous.\nc The neighbouring Nations took\noccasion from this weak Admini\nstration to invade the State5 and had\nit not been for the Prudence and\nBravery of Sygeus, all had been lost,\nand the People must have submit\nted to a foreign Yoke. But this\nPrince engag'd, defeated, and drove\nthe Enemy out of the Country.\nc It was then decided in the su<\npreme Council of the old Men,\nThat the King to be chosen for the\nsuture^ should not be the Person who\ngave Proofs of the quickest Parts,\nbut of the soundest Judgment.\nThey were of Opinion, that to talk\neloquently, or to be fruitful in\nExpedients, were not Talents so\nessential to a good Governour, as\nC 2 ' *\n\f20 The Travels o^Cyrus.\n* a just Discernment in chusing, and\n' a Steadiness and Courage in pur-\n* suing the best and wisest Counsels\/\nCyrus usually confess'd his Faults\nwithout seeking to excuse them. He\nlistened to this Story with Attention.,\nperceived the Design oiMandana in\ntelling it him, and resolved to correct:\nhimself.\nSoon after this, he gave a notable\nProof of his Genius and Courage.\nHe was scarce Seventeen Years ofAge\nwhen Merodac Son of Nabuchodono-\nsor King of Assyria assembled some\nTroops under pretence of Hunting,\nand made an Irruption into Media.\nHe left his Infantry upon the Fron\ntiers, and marching in Person with\ntwelve thousand Horse towards the\nfirst strong Places belonging to the\nMedes, encamped near them, and\nfrom thence sent out Detachments\nevery\n\fThe Travels of Cyrus. 2 J\nevery Day to scour and ravage the\nCountry.\nAjlyages had early Notice that\nthe Enemy was enter'd into his\nDominions, and after having given\nthe necessary Orders for assembling his\nArmy, he set out with his Son Cy-\naxares and young Cyrus, followed\nonly by some Squadrons levy'd in\nhaste, to the Number of eight thou\nsand Horse.\nWhen he was come near the Bor\nders of his own Country, he en-\ncam p'd upon a rising Ground, from\nwhence he discover'd the Plain which\nMerodac ravaged by his Detach\nments. Aftyages ordered two of his\nGeneral Officers to go and observe\nthe Enemy. Cyrus desired leave to\naccompany them, in order to inform\nhimself of the Situation of the Coun\ntry, the advantageous Posts, and the\nStrength of the Assyrian Army.\nC 3 Having\n\f2t The Travels of Cyrus.\nHaving made his Observations, he\ncame back, and gave an exact: Ac\ncount of all he had seen.\nAfiyages the next Day assembled\na Council of War to deliberate upon\nthe Motions he should make. The\ngreatest Part of the General Officers,\napprehending some Ambush if they\nshould leave their Camp, advis'd the\nsuspending all Action, till the Arrival\nof new Troops. Cyrus, who was\nimpatient to engage, hearken'd to\ntheir Reasonings with Uneasiness, but\nobserved a profound Silence out of\nRespect to the Emperor, and so ma\nny experiencd Commanders 3 till at\nlength Ajiyages order'd him to speak.\nHe then rose up in the midst of the\nAssembly, and with a noble and mo\ndest Air, said, \/ discovers Tejierday\nupon the Right of the Enemies Camp\na great Wood : I havejuji causd it to\nle view'd.

Ajtyages was surpriz'd\nat the Justness of his Thought, and\nimmediately commanded that his\nCounsel should be follow'd.\nCyaxares marched strait to the\nEnemy, while Cyrus, accompanied\nby Hyflafpes, filed off with a Body\nof Cavalry, without being discovers,\nand conceal'd himself in the Wood.\nThe Prince of the Medes attack'd the\nAssyrians dispers'd in the Plain.

The Assyrians\nseeing themselves thus attack'd on all\nSides, lost Courage, and fled in Dis\norder.\nCyrus, after the Battle, was sen\nsibly touch'd with seeing the Field\ncover'd with dead Bodies. He took the\nlame Care of the wounded Assyrians,\nas of the Medes, and gave the ne\ncessary Orders for their Cure.

She was desirous to carry\nback her Son with her, but Aftyages\nopposed it : Why will you, said he,\ndeprive me of the 'Pleasure offeeing\nCyrus ? He will be the Support of\nmy old Age : besides, he will here\nlearn military discipline, which is\nnot yet known in Persia. \/ conjure\nyou by the 'Tenderness which I have\nalways shewn you, not to refuse me\nthis Consolation.\n\u25a0\nMandana could not yield her Con\nsent, but with infinite Concern. She\ndreaded the leaving her Son in the\nmidst of a Courts which was the\nSeat of Voluptuousness. Being alone\nwith Cyrus, stie was resolv d to sound\nhis Inclinations, and ask'd him, Whe\nther he liked best to stay at Ecbatana,\nor to return to 'Persia.

In a word, you will look upon\nit as a matter of mere T)ecency, a\npolitick Phantom, a popular Preju\ndice, from which Men ought togetfree,\nwhen they can indulge their Passions\nin secret.

The\nyoung Prince melted into Tears, and\nstood silent. This was his first Se\nparation from her.

But\nthis able Politician successfully made\nuse of his Address to prevent a\nRebellion.\n' He had a golden Cistern., in\nwhich he and his Courtiers used to\nwarn their Hands upon solemn\nFestivals.

It was then that Idolatry\ncame into Egypt. Sculpture, Paint\ning and Poesy obscur'd all pure Ideas,\nand transformed them into sensible\nImages. The Vulgar stop there,\nwithout seeing into the hidden Mean\ning of the Allegories.\nSome little time after this Invasion of\nthe Arabians, several Egyptians, who\ncould not support the Yoke of Fo\nreigners, left their Country, and settled\nthemselves in Colonies in all Parts of\nthe\n\fThe Travelso\/Cyrus. 1 6\/\nthe World.

There were\nnear Two thousand of them, who\nwere able to inspire all the Troops\nwith Courage, military Virtues, and\nAttachment to the Prince.

But before he\npronounc'd Judgment, he went to\nthe Temple to invoke the Gods, and\nto offer Sacrifice. Being there, sur\nrounded by all his Court, and the\nVictims standing at the Altar, he\nassisted at a Prayer, full ofInstruction 5\nthe Form of which was as follows :\n' Great Osiris !

For it scem'd absurd\nto employ Troops for the Defence of\na Country, who had no Interest in\nits Preservation.\nThe common People were divided\ninto three Classes, Husbandmen,\nShepherds, and Artizans. These\nthree Sorts made great Improvements,\neach in their Professions: Being\nbrought up to them from Generation\nto Generation, they made Advantage\nof the Experience of their Ancestors.\nEach Family transmitted its Know\nledge and Skill to the Children of it.\n2 No\n\ftshe Travels os Cyrus. 175\nNo Person was allow'd to go out of\nhis Rank, or to forsake his hereditary-\nEmployment.

It\nseem'd a Madness in Egypt to despise\na Man because he serves his Country\nin a more laborious Employment.\nAnd thus was a due Subordination of\nRanks preferv'd, without Envy in one\nSort, or Contempt in the other.\nThe Third Law regarded Civil\nJustice.

Each Man, however,\nhad his particular Qualities and\nPassions 5 but all Passions were sub\nservient to the Love of Virtue 5\nand all Talents applied to the\nDiscovery of Truth. The Beau\nties of Nature, and of its Author,\nwere the Diversion, Enter\ntainment, and Study of the first\nMen.\n' The Imagination, being well re\ngulated, presented nothing then\nbut agreeable Ideas. The Passions,\nbeing in Subjection to Reason, did\nnot disturb the Heart: And the.\nLove of 'Pleasure was always, in\nConformity to the Low of Order.\nThe God O\/tris, the Goddess Ifis,\nand their Son Orus, came and con-\n' versed\n\fThe Travels of Cyrus. iq\nversed with Men, and taught them\nall the Mysteries ofWisdom.\n' This terrestrial Life., how happy\nsoever, was nevertheless but the\nInfancy of our Beings, in which\nSouls were prepar'd for a successive\nunfolding of Intelligence and Hap\npiness. After having liv'd a cer\ntain Time upon Earth, Men chang'd\ntheir Form without dying, and flew\naway to the Stars, where they en\njoy'd new Pleasures and new Know\nledge, new Senses, and new Light.\nFrom thence they were rais'd to\nanother World, then to a Third 5\nand so pasted through the immense\nSpaces by endless Metamorphoses.\nc A whole Age, and, according to\n4 some, many Ages, pass'd in this\nManner.

The\nSoul of the great Ofiris forsook\nhis Body , which is Nature,\nand it became a Carcass. Typhon\ntore it in Pieces, dispers'd its\nMembers, and blasted all its Beau\nties.\nc From that Time the Body be-\nc came subject to Diseases and Death,\n' the Mind to Error and to Passions.\n* The Imagination of Man presents\n* him now with nothing but Chi-\n* mera's. His Reason serves only to\n4 contradict his Inclinations, without\ns being\n\fThe Travels of Cyrus. 195\nbeing able to rectify them. The\ngreatest Part of his Pleasures are\nfalse and deceitful ; and all his\n... .'\nPains, even his imaginary ones, are\nreal Evils.

This Valley was hemm'd in on\none side by inaccessible Mountains,\nand on the other by little Hills,\nwhich were stor'd, not with those\nRiches which are the Beauties of Na\nture, but with every thing that is *\nnecessary to supply Mens Wants,\nThe Situation of the Country had\ncontributed very much to the Warlike\nand Savage Genius of its Inhabitants.\nAs Cyrus enter'd the City, he beheld\nonly plain and uniform Buildings,\nvery different from the stately Palaces\nhe had seen in Egypt. Every thing\nstill spoke the primitive Simplicity of\nthe Spartam. But their Manners\nwere upon the Point of being cor\nrupted under the Reign of Arijlon\nand Anaxandrides, if Chilo, one of\nthe\n\fThe Travels of Cyrus. 20j\nthe Seven Sages of Greece, had not\nprevented it.\nThose two Kings, of the antient\nRace of the HeracJides, fhar'd the\nSovereign Power between them.\nOne govern'd. the State, the other\ncommanded the Troops.\ndrijlon being naturally gracious,\naffable, and beneficent, put an equal\nConfidence in all those who were\nabout him.

He put on all\nShapes by turns 5 not to deceive (for\nhe was not wicked) but to gratify his\nprevailing Passion, which was the\nDesire of Pleasing, and of being the\nIdol of Men. In a Word, he was a\nCompound of whatever is most agree\nable and irregular. Anson lov'd him,\nand was entirely govern'd by him.\nThis Favourite led his Master into\nall Sorts of Voluptuousness.

He despis'd\nMen too much, and was regardless\nboth of their Praises and Favours.\nHe humdur'd neither Princes, nor\ntheir Courtiers. His Hatred of Vice\nrender'd his Manners fierce and savage,\nlike those of the first Spartans. He\nlook'd for Perfection in every thing 5\nand as he never found it, he had no\nintimate Friendship with any Person.\nNo body lov'd him, but all sear'd\nhim, and all esteem'd him upon Ac\ncount of his great Qualities. In a\nWord, he was an Abridgment of all\nthose Virtues which make Men most\nrefpetfed, and most avoided. Anax-\nandrides\n\f2o8 The Travels osC yrus.\nandrides grew weary of him, and\nbanish'd him. Thus did this Prince\nweaken the Strength of Sparta, while\nArijlon corrupted his Manners.\nChilo, who had educated the two\nyoung Princes, went and spoke to\nthem in the following Manner :\nMy Age, my long Services, and\nthe Care I have taken of your Edu\ncation, give me a Right to speak\nto you with Freedom.

'\nIn\n\fThe Travels of Cyrus* hi\nIn reality, great Care was taken of\nthe Education of Children at Sparta*\nThey were chiefly taught to obey,\nto undergo Labour, to conquer in\nCombats, and to face Pain and Death\nwith Courage. They went with\ntheir Heads and Feet naked, lay up\non Rushes, and ate very little 5 and\nthis little they were obliged to procure\nby Dexterity, in the publick Banquet\ning Rooms. Not that the Spartans\nauthorized Thefts and Robberies 5 for\nas all was in common in this Repub\nlics those Vices could have no\nPlace there : But the Design was\nto accustom Children, who were de\nstin'd for War, to surprize the Vigi\nlance of those who watch'd over\nthem, and to expose themselves cou\nrageously to the severest Punishments,\niri case they fail'd of that Dexterity\nwhich was exacted of them.\nLycurgus had remark'd, that sub\ntile Speculations^ and all the Refine\nments\n\fin The Travels ofC yr us.\nments of Science, serv'd often only\nto spoil the Understanding, and cor\nrupt the Heart 5 for which Reason he\nmade little Account of them. No\nshing, however, was neglected, to\nawaken in Children the Taste of\npure Reason, and to give them a\nStrength ofJudgment 5 but all Kinds\nof Studies, which were not ser\nviceable togood Manners, were look'd\nupon as useless and dangerous Occu\npations.

I therefore contented my-\n1 self with setting Bounds to it.\n1 I was throughly sensible, that\nno State can subsist without some\nSubordination.

I made them sensible of the\nc fatal Consequences of such false\nc Maxims.\n' I prov'd to them, that the natu-\nc ral Equality., ^which those Men\n1 talk'd of, is a Chimera, founded\n' upon the Poetical Fables of the\n' Companions of Cadmus, and the\nc Children of T)eucalion 5 that there\ni never was a Time, in which Men\n' rose in that Manner out of the\nc Earth, in a State of perfect Man-\n' hood 5 that it was ridiculous to\n' offer the Sports of the Imagination\n' for Principles 5 that ever since the\n' Golden Age, the Oder of Gene-\n1 ration had made a necessary Depen-\n* dance and a natural Inequality\n' among\n\f270 fTfo Travels ofCyrus.\nc among Men : And lastly, that pa-\n* ternal Authority had been the first\n* Model of all Governments.\n1 I made a Law, by which ic\n' was ordained, That every Man\n' who had given no other 'Proof of\n' his good Sense, but lively Sallies of\n1 Imagination, florid 'Discourses, and\nc the Talent of Talking upon all Sub-\n1 jefis, without going to the Bottom\n1 of any Thing, Jhould be incapable\nc of publick Employments.'\nHere Cyrus interrupted Solon, and\nsaid to him, ' But aster all, methinks\n* Merit is what ought to make the\n' Distinction among Men. Wit is\n' the lowest Sort of Merit, because\nc it is always dangerous when alone :\n* But Wisdom, Virtue, and Valour,\n1 give a natural Right to govern.\n' He alone ought to command others,\n* who has most Wisdom to discover\n1 what is just, most Virtue to ad-\n* here\n\fThe Travels of Cyrus. 271\n* here to it, and most Courage to\nc put it in Execution.\n* Merit, reply'd Solon, essentially\n' distinguishes Men, and ought sole*\n1 ly to determine Ranks : But Igno-\n* ranee and Passions often hinder us\n* from discerning it.

The lower Sort ought\nto be content with meriting the in\nternal Esteem of Men, by their\nsimple and modest Virtue 5 and\nthe Great should be persuaded that\nnothing but outward Homage will\nbe paid thenr, unless they have true\nMerit. By this Means, the one\nSort will not be dejected with their\nlow Condition 5 nor the other\npride themselves too much, in their\nGrandeur. Men will become sen\nsible, that Kings are necessary 5 and\nKings will not forget, that they are\nMen.

T < The\n\f274 ^e Travels of Cyblus.\n4 The second Source of the\nMiseries of Athens, said Solon, was\nthe excessive Riches of some,\nand the extreme Poverty os\nothers. This terrible Inequality in\na popular Government, occafion'd\neternal Disorders. I durst not at\ntempt to remedy this Disorder, by\nestablishing a Community of Goods\nas at Sparta. The Genius of the\nAthenians, which carries them to\nLuxury and Pleasures, would never\nhave suffered such an Equality : But\nin order to diminish our Evils, I\nabolish'd all Debts 5 I began by\nremitting those which were due to\nme.

I\nretain d enough for my own Per-\n' son,\n\fThe Travels of Cyrus 275\nson, and was therefore rich 5 but\nI esteem'd my self poor,because I had\nnot sufficient to distribute something\nto all the Unfortunate. I spread\nabroad at Athens this useful Maxim,\nThat all the Members of the fame\nCommonwealth ought to feel and\ncompassionate the Miseries of one\nanother, as Tarts of the fame\nBody.\nc The third Source of our Miff\nchiefs, was the Multiplicity of\nLaws, which is as evident a Token\nof the Corruption of a State, as\na Diversity of Medicines is of the\nDistempers of Bodies.\n* Here again I could not imitate\nLycurgus.

I contented\nmy self with abolishing all those\nLaws, which serv'd only to exer\ncise the subtle Genius of the So\nphists, and the Skill of the Law\nyers 5 reserving only a small Num\nber of such as were simple, short,\nand clear. By this Means I avoid\ned contentious Chicane, that Mon\nster, produc'd by the idle Subtlety\nof Men, to elude Justice. I fix'd\ncertain Times for the final Deter\nmination of .

Lastly, I abo-\nlifh'd the too severe Laws of 2)raco,\nwhich punilh'd the smallest Weak\nness, and the greatest Crime, equally\nwith Death, and I proportion'd the\nPunishment to the Offence.\ne\nc The fourth Source of Evils.,\nwas the bad Education of Chil-\n1 dren.\n\fThe Travels of Cyrus. %y;\ndren.

The Athenians were serious\nabout Trifles, and look'd upon\nsolid Matters as too abstracted.\n' In order to prevent these Mis\nchiefs., I ordain'dthat the Council of\nAreopagus should super-intend the\nEducation of Children. I would\nnot have them educated in such\nIgnorance, as the Spartans, nor\nconfin'dj as before, to the Study\nof Eloquence, Poesy, and those\nSciences, which serve only to adorn\nthe Imagination.

Stately Edifi\nces, pompous Decorations, and the\nnice Rules, which have been since\nobserved, were not then known.\nTragedy was not in that Perfection\nto which it was brought by Sophocles 5\nbut it answer'd all the Views of Po\nlicy, for which it was introduc'd.\nThe Greek Poets, in their Drama\ntic Performances, usually represented\nthe Tyranny of Kings, in order to\nstrengthen the Aversion which the\nAthenians had to Royalty : But $*'$-\nJljlratus directed the Deliverance of\nAndromeda to be acted.

After this, Solon led the young\nPrince to Areopagus, to take a\nRepast there 5 which was more frugal\nthan that at the Palace of tPi\/tJlra-\ntus, but not less agreeable. Du\nring the Entertainment, Cyrus de-\nsir a the old Sage to explain to him\nthe Nature, Design, and principal\nParts, of Tragedy, which he did not\nyet understand. Solon, who was\nhimself a Poet, answer'd :\nc The Theatre is a living Picture\n' of the Virtues and Passions of Men.\n1 Imitation deceives the Mind into a\n* Belief, that the Objects are really\nc present, and not represented\/\nc You have formerly read our\n* Poet, Homer 5 the Drama is only\n* an Abridgement of Epic-Poesy*\n* The one is an Action recited, the\n1 other an Action represented.

The one\nmay abound with the Marvellous\nand Supernatural, because it treats\nof heroick Virtues, which the Gods\nalone inspire 5 but in the other,\nwhere human Passions prevail, the\nNatural must be joined with the\nSurprizing, to shew the Effect and\nSport of those Passions. The heaping\nWonders upon Wonders, transports\nthe Mind beyond the Limits of Na\nture, but it only excites Admiration.\nOn the contrary, by describing the\nEffects of Virtue and Vice, both\nwithout and within us, Man is\nbrought to see and know himself 5\nthe Heart is touch'd, while the\nMind is diverted.\nc The Virtmus, the Useful, and\nc the Agreeable, must be united, in\nI order to reach the Sublime.

Never\ntheless it is necessary to conform to\nthe Weakness of Mankind. Too\nmuch Moralizing disgusts 5 too\nmuch Reasoning tires. We must\nturn Maxims into Action, convey\nnoble Sentiments by a single\nWord, and instruct rather by the\nManners of the Hero, than by his\nDiscourse.\n< These\n\f304 The Travels os Cyrus.\n* These are the great Rules found\ned upon human Nature, and the\nSprings which must be put in Mo\ntion to make Pleasure serviceable\nto Instruction. I foresee that one\nDay these Rules may be improv'd,\nby introducing into such Entertain\nments, all the Arts of Imitation,\nPainting, Musick, and Dancing,\nas well as Poesy. Hitherto I have\ncontented my self with making the\nTheatre a School of Philosophy, for\nthe young Athenians, and useful\nto their Education. It argues an\nIgnorance of human Nature, to at-\ntempt to lead it to Wisdom at once\nby Constraint and Severity.

It was then that the\nDesigns of that perfidious Minister\nbroke out. Instead of pacifying\nthem, he incensed them more and\nmore, put himself at their Head,\nand was proclaim'd King.

But\nthis able Politician successfully made\nuse of his Address to prevent a\nRebellion.\n' He had a golden Cistern., in\nwhich he and his Courtiers used to\nwarn their Hands upon solemn\nFestivals.

Their principal Residences\nwere at Memphis, Thanh, This,\nElephantis, and Thebes. This last\nDynasty fwallow'd up all the rest,\nand became Mistress.

In those Days\nlived the first Hermes, who pene\ntrated into all the Secrets of Nature,\nand of Divinity. It was the Age of\noccult Sciences.

Their Imagination could re\nceive nothing but what was Material\nand Sensible. From their Time the\nGenius of the Egyptians was intirely\nchang'd, and turn'd to the Study of\nArts, Architecture, Commerce, War,\nand all the superficial kinds of Know\nledge, which are useless to those who\ncan content themselves with simple\nNature. It was then that Idolatry\ncame into Egypt. Sculpture, Paint\ning and Poesy obscur'd all pure Ideas,\nand transformed them into sensible\nImages. The Vulgar stop there,\nwithout seeing into the hidden Mean\ning of the Allegories.\nSome little time after this Invasion of\nthe Arabians, several Egyptians, who\ncould not support the Yoke of Fo\nreigners, left their Country, and settled\nthemselves in Colonies in all Parts of\nthe\n\fThe Travelso\/Cyrus. 1 6\/\nthe World. From thence came all\nthe great and famous Men in other\nNations. The Babylonian Belus,\nthe Athenian Cecrops, the B\u0153otian\nCadmus. Thence it is, that all the\nNations of the Universe owe their\nLaws, Sciences, and Religion to\nEgypt. In this manner spoke the\nPriests to Cyrus.\nIn this Age liv'd the second Her\nmes, calYdTrismegiJlus. He was the\nRestorer ofthe antient Religion. He\ncollected the Laws and Sciences of\nthe first Mercury, in Forty-two\nVolumes, which were call'd, The\nTreasure of Remedies for the Soul,\nbecause they cure the Mind of its\nIgnorance, the Source of all Evils.\nThe third Age was that of Con\nquests and Luxury.

Upon\nthe Death of the King, Sesojtris\nlevy'd a formidable Army, and ap\npointed the young Men who had\nbeen educated with him, to be the\nOfficers to command it. There were\nnear Two thousand of them, who\nwere able to inspire all the Troops\nwith Courage, military Virtues, and\nAttachment to the Prince. They\nconsider'd him both as their Master\nand their Brother. He form'd a De\nsign of conquering the whole World,\nand penetrated into the Indies, far\nther than either Bacchus or Hercules.\nThe Scythians submitted to his Em\npire. Thrace and Jfia Minor are\nfull of the Monuments of his Victo\nries. Upon those Monuments are to\nbe seen the proud Inscriptions of,\nSesostris King of Kings, and Lord of\nLords. Having; extended his Con-\nquests\n\fThe Travels of Cyrus. 160\nquests from the Ganges to the Tianube,\nand from the River Tanais to the\nExtremities of Africa, he return'd\nafter Nine Years Absence, loaded with\nthe Spoils of all the concjuer'd Na\ntions, and drawn in a Chariot by the\nKings whom he had fubdu'd.\nHis Government was altogether\nMilitary and Despotical. He lessen'd\nthe Authority ofthe Pontiffs,and trans\nfer'd their Power to the Commanders\nof the Army. After his Death Divi\nsions arose among those Chiefs.\nThey were become too powerful to\ncontinue united under one Master.\nUnder Anijis the Blind, Sabacon the\nEthiopian took Advantage of their\nDiscords, and invaded Egypt. This\nReligious Prince re-establifh'd the\nPower of the Priests, reign'd fifty\nYears in a profound Peace, and then\nreturn'd into his own Country, to\nobey the Oracles of his Gods. The\nKingdom thus forsaken, fell into the\nHands\n\f170 ^TuAVELS o\/CyRUS.\nHands of Sethon the High-Priest of\nVulcan, who entirely destroyed the\nArt of War among the Egyptians,\nand despised the Military Men. The\nReign ofSuperstition, which enfeebles\nCourage, succeeded that of despotick\nPower, which had too much depress'd\nit. From that time Egypt was sup\nported only by foreign Troops, and\nit fell by degrees into Anarchy.\nTwelve Nomarchs, chosen by the\nPeople, shar'd the Kingdom between\nthem.

Cyrus col\nlected the Principal of them from his\nConversation with all the great Men\nand old Sages who were then living.\nThese Laws are reduced to three,\nupon which all the rest depend.\nThe First relates to Kings, the Second\nto Polity, and the Third to Civil\nJustice.\nThe Kingdom was Hereditary,\nbut the Kings were obliged to observe\nthe Laws with greater Exactness than\nothers. The Egyptians esteemed it a\ncriminal Usurpation upon the Rights\nof the Great Ofiris, and as a mad\nPresumption in a Man to give his\nWill for a Law.\nAs soon as the King rose in the\nMorning, which was at the Break of\nDay,\n\f17* The Tft-Av els os Cyrus.\nDay, when the Understanding is\nclearest, and the Soul most serene, an\nexact: and distinct: Idea was given him\nof all Matters upon which he was to\ndecide that Day. But before he\npronounc'd Judgment, he went to\nthe Temple to invoke the Gods, and\nto offer Sacrifice. Being there, sur\nrounded by all his Court, and the\nVictims standing at the Altar, he\nassisted at a Prayer, full ofInstruction 5\nthe Form of which was as follows :\n' Great Osiris ! Eye of the World,\n* and Light ofSpirits I Grant to the\nc 'Prince, your Image, all Royal\n* Virtues, that he may he religious\n' towards the Gods , and benign\nc towards Men 5 moderate, just ,\n* magnanimous, generous, an Enemy\n1 ofFalfiood, Master of his Passions,\n1 punishing less than the Crime\nc deserves, and rewarding beyond\n< Merit!\n1 After\n\fThe Travels of Cyrus. 173\nAfter this, the High-Priest repre\nsented to him the Faults he had com\nmitted against the Laws 5 but it was\nalways suppos'd that he fell into them\nby Surprize, or through Ignorance 5\nand the Ministers, who had given\nhim evil Counsels, or had disguis'd\nthe Truth, were loaded with Impre\ncations.\nAfter the Prayer and the Sacrifice,\nthey read to him the Actions of the\nHeroes and great Kings, that the\nMonarch might imitate their Example,\nand maintain the Laws which had\nrender'd his Predecessors illustrious,\nand their People happy.\nWhat is there that might not be\nhop'd for from Princes accustom'd,\nas an essential Part of their Religion,\nto hear Daily the strongest and most\nsalutary Truths ? Accordingly, the\ngreater Number of them were so dear\nto\n\f174 The Travels os Cyrus.\nto their People, that each private\nMan bewail'd their Death like that of\na Father.\nThe Second Law related to Polity,\nand the Subordination of Ranks.\nThe Lands were divided into three\nParts. The First was the King's\nDomain 5 the Second belong'd to the\nChief Priests 5 and the Third to the\nMilitary Men. For it scem'd absurd\nto employ Troops for the Defence of\na Country, who had no Interest in\nits Preservation.\nThe common People were divided\ninto three Classes, Husbandmen,\nShepherds, and Artizans. These\nthree Sorts made great Improvements,\neach in their Professions: Being\nbrought up to them from Generation\nto Generation, they made Advantage\nof the Experience of their Ancestors.\nEach Family transmitted its Know\nledge and Skill to the Children of it.\n2 No\n\ftshe Travels os Cyrus. 175\nNo Person was allow'd to go out of\nhis Rank, or to forsake his hereditary-\nEmployment. By this means Arts\nwere cultivated and brought to a\ngreat Perfection $ and the Troubles,\noccasion'd by the Ambition of those\nwho seek to rise above their natural\nCondition, were prevented.\nTo the End that no Person might\nbe asham'd of the Lowness of his State\nand Degree, Arts were held in Honour.\nIn the Body Politick, as in the Na\ntural, all the Members contribute\nsomething to the common Life. It\nseem'd a Madness in Egypt to despise\na Man because he serves his Country\nin a more laborious Employment.\nAnd thus was a due Subordination of\nRanks preferv'd, without Envy in one\nSort, or Contempt in the other.\nThe Third Law regarded Civil\nJustice. Thirty Judges, drawn out\nof the principal Cities, compos'd the\nsupreme\n:\nI\n\f\\j(> The Travels of Cyrus.\nsupreme Council, which judg'd the\nKingdom.

Surprize in giving Judg\nment, the Pleaders were forbidden\nthat delusive Eloquence,which dazzles\nthe Understanding, and moves the\nPassions. They expos'd the Matters\nof Fact: with a clear and nervous\nBrevity, stript of the false Orna\nments of Reasoning. The President\nof the Senate wore a Collar of Gold\nand. precious Stones, at which hung\na small Figure without Eyes, which\nwas call'd Truth. He apply'd it to\nthe Forehead and Heart of him who\nwas to gain his Cause 5 for that was\nthe\n\fThe Travels of Cyrus. 177\nthe Manner of pronouncing Judg\nment.\nThere was in Egypt a fort of\nJustice unknown to other Nations.\nAs soon as a Man had yielded his last\nBreath, he was brought into Judg\nment, and the publick Accuser was\nheard against him.

These Things gave Cyrus a great\nDesire to instruct himself throughly\nin the Religion of antient Egypt.\nFor this Purpose he went to Thebes.\nThis famous City, whose hundred\nGates have been fung by Homer\u25a0,\nmight dispute with all the Cities in\nthe Universe for Magnificence, Ex-\n, tent and Power.

Sonchis conducted him\ninto a spacious Hall, where were\nthree hundred Statues of Egyptian\nPontiffs. This long Succession for so\nmany Ages, gave the Prince a high\nNotion of the Antiquity of the\nReligion of Egypt, and a great Cu\nriosity taknow the Principles of it.\n4 To make you acquainted, said\nc the Pontiff\", with the Origin of our\nc Worship, Symbols, and Mysteries,\n* I must give you the History of\n' Hermes Trifmegijlus, who was the\nc Founder of them.\n1 Hermes, the second of the Name,\nwas of the Race of our first Sove\nreigns. While his Mother was\nwith Child of him, {he went by\nSea to Libya, to make a Sacrifice\nto 'Jupiter Hammon.

A young She-Goat, of\nc which there were great Plenty in\n* this Island, hearing his Cries, came\n* and suckled him till he was past In-\n* fancy. For some Years he fed up-\nc on the tender Grafs, with his Nurse,\nc but afterwards upon Dates and\nc wild Fruits, which seemed to him\nc a more proper Food.\n' He perceived by the first Rays\n* of Reason, which began to shine\nc in him, That he was not of the\n* fame Make with the Beajis 5 that\n< he had more Understanding, Inven-\nN 3 tion,\n\fl8i The Travels of Cyrus.\"\nc tion3 and Address than they 5 and\n* thence he suspected, That he might\n? be of a different Nature.\nc The She-Goat, which had nou\nrished him, died of old Age. He\nwas surpriz'd at this new Ph\u00e6no-\nmenon, of which he had never ob-\nserv'd the like before. He could'\nnot comprehend why she continue!\nso long cold, and without Motion.\nHe compar'd all he saw in her with\nwhat he felt in himself, and per-\nceiv'd that he had a Beating in his\nBreast, and a Principle of Motion\nin him, which was no longer in\nher. He saw her by Degrees pu-\ntrify, grow dry, and fall to Pieces.\nNothing remain'd but the Bones.\nThe Mind speaks to its self, with\nout knowing the arbitrary Names.\nwhich we have affixed to our.Ideas.\nHermes reason'd thus : -The Goat\ndid not give itself that 'Principle\n'of\n\fThe Travels of Cyrus. i&j\n* of Lifey since it has loft it, and\n* cannot restore it to itself,\n1 He sought a long Time what\n' might be the Cause of this Change.\n* He obferv'd that the Plants and\n* Trees scem'd to dye, and to re-\nc vive every Year, by the going\n< away and return of the Sun, and\n1 imagin'd that this Star was the Prin-\n* ciple of all Things.\n* He gather'd up the Bones of his\n1 Mother-Nurse, and exposed them\n' to the Rays of the Sun 5 but Life\n-'did not return.

He concluded\n' therefore, That the Stars 'were not\nx thefirji 'Principles of Life.\n1 As he advanced in Age, his Un-\n* derstanding ripen'd, and his Re\nflections became more profound.\ni He had remark'd, that inanimate\nBodies could not move of them\nselves 5 that Animals did not re?\nstore Motion to themselves when\nthey had lost it, and that the Sun\ndid not revive dead Bodies.\n1 Thence he concluded, That the\nFirst Mover was something\ngreater than the Sun or the\nStars.\nc Reflecting afterwards upon him\nself, and upon all the Remarks\nwhich he had made from the first\nUse of his Reason, he observ'd,\n1That\n\fThe Travels of Cyrus, 185\n* That there was something in him\n' which felt, which thought, and\n* which compared his Thoughts to-\nc gether. After having meditated\n' whole Years upon all those Opera-\n* tions of his Mind, he concluded at\nc length, That the First: Mover had\n\u2022' Understanding as well as Force,\n' and that his Wisdom was equal to his\n' 'Power.\nc Man in the midst of Beings who\n' can give him no Succour, is in a\n4 frightful Situation. But when he\nc discovers the Idea of something\nc which is able to make him happy,\n* there is nothing which can compare\n* with his Hopes and his Joy.\n' The Desire of Happiness, inse-\n' parable from our Nature, made\n* Hermes wish to see that Firs Mo*\n* ver, to know him, and to con-\n* verse with him. Is I could, said\n' he , make him understand my\n1 Thoughts,\n\ft86 The Travels of Cyrus.\n' Thoughts, and my 1>ejires, doubt~\nc less he would render me more happy\n' than I am.\nc His Hopes and his Joy were\n1 soon disturb'd by great Doubts.\n' Alas ! said he, \/\/ the First Mover\nc be as good and beneficent as I ima-\n' gine hint) why do I not fee him ?\n1 Why has he not made himself known\n1 to me ? And above all, Why am I\n* in this mournful Solitude, where I\nc fee nothing like myself, nothing\ni which seems to reason as I do, no-\n1 thing which can give me any Asp-\n' fiance.\nc In the midst of these Per-\n' plexities, his weak Reason was\n* silent, and could answer him no-\nc thing.

He\n' then began to discern several Marks,\nc which he had not observed before,\nc of an infinite Wisdom and Power,\n* diffus'd throughout all Nature :\n* And thereby perceiv'd the Weakness\n' of human Reason, when left to it-\n' self, and without Instruction. He\n1 was astonish'd at his former Igno-\n1 ranee, but his new Discoveries pro-\n1 due'd new Perplexities.\nc One Day, when Mercury was\nc speaking to him of the noble De-\n* stiny of Man, the Dignity of his\n1 Nature, and the Immortality which\nc awaits him, he answer'd 5 If the\nc great Osiris ordains Mortals to so\n* perfect\n\fThe Travels of Cyrus. 189\nc perfect a Felicity, whence is it that\ni they are born in such Ignorance ?\n* Whence comes it that he does not\n*shew hemself to them, to dispel\n1 their ^Darkness ?

Every thing\nstill spoke the primitive Simplicity of\nthe Spartam. But their Manners\nwere upon the Point of being cor\nrupted under the Reign of Arijlon\nand Anaxandrides, if Chilo, one of\nthe\n\fThe Travels of Cyrus. 20j\nthe Seven Sages of Greece, had not\nprevented it.\nThose two Kings, of the antient\nRace of the HeracJides, fhar'd the\nSovereign Power between them.\nOne govern'd. the State, the other\ncommanded the Troops.\ndrijlon being naturally gracious,\naffable, and beneficent, put an equal\nConfidence in all those who were\nabout him.

They were surrounded\nby Children, who waited on them.\nTheir Temperance and Austerity of\nLife was so great, that other Nations\nused to say, It was better to die,\nthan to live like the Spartans. During\nthe Repast, they discours'd together\non grave and serious Matters 5 the\nInterests of their Country, the Laws\nof Sparta, the Lives of the Great\nMen, the Difference of a good and\nbad Citizen, and of whatever might\nform Youth to the Taste of military\nVirtues. Their Discourse contain'd\nmuch Sense in sew Words 5 for which\nReason the Laconick Style has been\nadmir'd in all Nations. By imitating\nthe Rapidity of Thought, it gave the\nPleasure of hearing all in a Moment,\nand of discovering a profound Mean\ning which was unexpress'd. The\nP 4 graceful^\n\f'2\\6 The Travels of Cyrus.\ngraceful, fine and delicate Turns of\nthe Athenians were unknown at\nLacedamon.

There\ntheybeheld young Girls., almost naked,\ncontending with Boys in Running,\nWrestling, Dancing, and all Sorts of\nlaborious Exercises. The Boys were\nnot permitted to marry any but such\nas they had vanquish'd at these\nGames.\nCyrus was fhock'd to fee the\nLiberty, which reign'd in these Pub-\nlick Assemblies, between Persons of\ndifferent Sexes 5 and could not\nforbear representing it to Chilo.\n\u2666\u25a0J \u25a0!- * ' There\n\fThe Travels of Cykus, %\\y\nThere seems, said he, to be a\ngreat Inconsistency in the Laws of\nLycurgus.

He despis'd Effeminacy, but\nhe could not relish the Spartan\nRoughness, which sacrific'd the sweet\nest Charms of Society to Ambition,\nand knew not how toreconcile military\nVirtues with tender Passions. How\never, as he was sensible that Chilo\nwould little understand what he\nmeant by such Sentiments, he con\ntented himself with saying,\n1 Paternal Love seems to me a\n* Source of great Advantages to a\n?

'\nIn\n\fThe Travels of Cyrus* hi\nIn reality, great Care was taken of\nthe Education of Children at Sparta*\nThey were chiefly taught to obey,\nto undergo Labour, to conquer in\nCombats, and to face Pain and Death\nwith Courage. They went with\ntheir Heads and Feet naked, lay up\non Rushes, and ate very little 5 and\nthis little they were obliged to procure\nby Dexterity, in the publick Banquet\ning Rooms. Not that the Spartans\nauthorized Thefts and Robberies 5 for\nas all was in common in this Repub\nlics those Vices could have no\nPlace there : But the Design was\nto accustom Children, who were de\nstin'd for War, to surprize the Vigi\nlance of those who watch'd over\nthem, and to expose themselves cou\nrageously to the severest Punishments,\niri case they fail'd of that Dexterity\nwhich was exacted of them.\nLycurgus had remark'd, that sub\ntile Speculations^ and all the Refine\nments\n\fin The Travels ofC yr us.\nments of Science, serv'd often only\nto spoil the Understanding, and cor\nrupt the Heart 5 for which Reason he\nmade little Account of them. No\nshing, however, was neglected, to\nawaken in Children the Taste of\npure Reason, and to give them a\nStrength ofJudgment 5 but all Kinds\nof Studies, which were not ser\nviceable togood Manners, were look'd\nupon as useless and dangerous Occu\npations. The Spartans were of Opi\nnion, that in the present State of\nhuman Nature, Man is sorrnd ra\nther for Action than Knowledge, and\nbetter qualify'd for Society than Con\ntemplation.\nIj..\nCyrus, aster this, went to the\nGymnafes, where the Youth did their\nExercises.

The Helots, who were their\nSlaves, manur'd their Lands, and\nwere the only Mechanicks among\nthem: For they esteem'd it a vileThing\nto be employ'd about what regarded\nonly a Provision for the Body.\nCyrus\n\f2i4 ^Travels o\/CyrUS.\nCyrus having learnt this Maxim\ndf the Laced\u00e6monians, said to\nChilo, ' Agriculture and the Arts,\n1 seem to me absolutely necessary,\nc to preserve a People from Idle-\n* ness, which begets Discord, Eflse-\n* minacy, and all the Evils destruc*\n1 tive of Society.

I made them sensible of the\nc fatal Consequences of such false\nc Maxims.\n' I prov'd to them, that the natu-\nc ral Equality., ^which those Men\n1 talk'd of, is a Chimera, founded\n' upon the Poetical Fables of the\n' Companions of Cadmus, and the\nc Children of T)eucalion 5 that there\ni never was a Time, in which Men\n' rose in that Manner out of the\nc Earth, in a State of perfect Man-\n' hood 5 that it was ridiculous to\n' offer the Sports of the Imagination\n' for Principles 5 that ever since the\n' Golden Age, the Oder of Gene-\n1 ration had made a necessary Depen-\n* dance and a natural Inequality\n' among\n\f270 fTfo Travels ofCyrus.\nc among Men : And lastly, that pa-\n* ternal Authority had been the first\n* Model of all Governments.\n1 I made a Law, by which ic\n' was ordained, That every Man\n' who had given no other 'Proof of\n' his good Sense, but lively Sallies of\n1 Imagination, florid 'Discourses, and\nc the Talent of Talking upon all Sub-\n1 jefis, without going to the Bottom\n1 of any Thing, Jhould be incapable\nc of publick Employments.'\nHere Cyrus interrupted Solon, and\nsaid to him, ' But aster all, methinks\n* Merit is what ought to make the\n' Distinction among Men.

The lower Sort ought\nto be content with meriting the in\nternal Esteem of Men, by their\nsimple and modest Virtue 5 and\nthe Great should be persuaded that\nnothing but outward Homage will\nbe paid thenr, unless they have true\nMerit. By this Means, the one\nSort will not be dejected with their\nlow Condition 5 nor the other\npride themselves too much, in their\nGrandeur.

T < The\n\f274 ^e Travels of Cyblus.\n4 The second Source of the\nMiseries of Athens, said Solon, was\nthe excessive Riches of some,\nand the extreme Poverty os\nothers. This terrible Inequality in\na popular Government, occafion'd\neternal Disorders. I durst not at\ntempt to remedy this Disorder, by\nestablishing a Community of Goods\nas at Sparta. The Genius of the\nAthenians, which carries them to\nLuxury and Pleasures, would never\nhave suffered such an Equality : But\nin order to diminish our Evils, I\nabolish'd all Debts 5 I began by\nremitting those which were due to\nme.

I spread\nabroad at Athens this useful Maxim,\nThat all the Members of the fame\nCommonwealth ought to feel and\ncompassionate the Miseries of one\nanother, as Tarts of the fame\nBody.\nc The third Source of our Miff\nchiefs, was the Multiplicity of\nLaws, which is as evident a Token\nof the Corruption of a State, as\na Diversity of Medicines is of the\nDistempers of Bodies.\n* Here again I could not imitate\nLycurgus.

I contented\nmy self with abolishing all those\nLaws, which serv'd only to exer\ncise the subtle Genius of the So\nphists, and the Skill of the Law\nyers 5 reserving only a small Num\nber of such as were simple, short,\nand clear. By this Means I avoid\ned contentious Chicane, that Mon\nster, produc'd by the idle Subtlety\nof Men, to elude Justice. I fix'd\ncertain Times for the final Deter\nmination of .

The Athenians were serious\nabout Trifles, and look'd upon\nsolid Matters as too abstracted.\n' In order to prevent these Mis\nchiefs., I ordain'dthat the Council of\nAreopagus should super-intend the\nEducation of Children. I would\nnot have them educated in such\nIgnorance, as the Spartans, nor\nconfin'dj as before, to the Study\nof Eloquence, Poesy, and those\nSciences, which serve only to adorn\nthe Imagination.

Py~\n' thagoras destroys Religion by his\n4 Refinements. His Love of Perfecti-\n4 on is a Chimera. Let us consult\n4 Nature, let us search into all the\n* secret Recesses of Man's Heart,\n4 let us interrogate Men of all Na-\nf tions we shall find, that Self-love\n* is the Source of all our Actions,\n1 our Passions, and even of our Vir-\n' tues.

The Feeling and Sen-\nC 3 i timenc\n\fiz The Travels of Cyrus.\nt\n' timent of all Hearts, authorizes\n4 my Doctrine , and this kind ^of\n4 Proof is the shortest and most con\nvincing.\nAnaximander , answer'd I, sub\nstitutes irregular Passions in the\nRoom of noble Sentiments. He\naffirms boldly, but he proves no\nthing. This is not my Method \\\nmy Proofs are these :\n* The Soul is a Particle of the\nDivine Nature, and therefore may\nimitate the Gods. The Gods do\ngood for the sole Love os Good 5\nconsequently she may love it as\nthey do. Such was the primitive\nNature of Man.

If we*\ncan love nothing but with reference\ni ' to\n\fThe Travels of Cyrus. 25\n1 to our selves, each Member of So-\n4 ciety will come by Degrees, to\nconsider himself, as an independent\n* Being, made for himself.

All that wisse\n' Antiquity tells us of the Amours\n* of Jupiter and the other Divini-\n\u20ac ties, are but Allegories, to repre-\n1 sent the pure Commerce of the\n4 Gods with Mortals in the Golden\n' Age.

Pythagoras overthrows your\nAltars, your Temples, and your\nPriesthood, that he may lead you\nto Impiety, under pretence of de\nstroying Superstition\/\n' A confused Murmur immedi\nately rose in the Assembly. They\nwere divided in their Sentiments.\nThe greatest part of the Priests\ntreated me as an impious Person,\nand an Enemy of Religion. Per\nceiving then the deep Dissimulation\nof Anaximander , and the blind\nZeal of the People, who were de\nluded by Sophistry, it was impost\nsible for me to contain my self 5\nand raising my Voice, I said,\n< O King, Priests, and Samiam \/\nhearken to me for the last time. I\nwould not at first lay open the\n' Mysteries\n\fThe Travels of Cyrus.\nc Mysteries of \u00c6aximanders mon-\nc strous System, nor endeavour in a\n* publick Assembly to render his\n4 Person odious, as he has endeavou-\n* red to do mine. But now that I\n' see the Abyss into which he seeks\nc to lead you, I can no longer be si-\n' lent, without betraying the Gods\n' and my Country.\nc Anaximander seems to you to\n' be zealous for Religion, but in re-\n' ality he endeavours to destroy it.\n* Hear what his Principles are, which\n' he teaches in secret to those who\nc will listen to him.\n4 In the fruitful Bosom of an in-\nc finite Matter, every thing is pro-\n* due'd by an eternal Revolution of\n* Forms.

The differ-\n* ent ranging of the Atoms makes\n\u20ac the different Sorts of Minds : But\n* all is dissipated and plung'd again\n' into\n\f1 8 The Travels of Cyrus.'\n* into the same Abyss after Death.\n4 According to Anaximander, that\n4 which is now Stone, Wood, Me-\n' tal, may be dissolv'd into Water,\n' Ait, pure Flame, and reasonable\n* Soul. This is the eternal Circle\n4 in which the Atoms roll. Accor-\n' ding to him, our own idle Fears\n4 have dug the infernal Pit, and our\n* own scared Imagination is the Source\n4 of those famous Rivers which flow\n4 in gloomy Tartarus. Our Super-\n4 stition has peopled the Celestial\n4 Regions with Gods and Demi-\n4 Gods, and it is our Vanity which\n4 makes us imagine that we mall\n4 one Day drink Ne&ar with them.\n4 According to him, Goodness and\n4 Malice, Virtue and Vice, Justice\n4 and Injustice, are but Names\n4 which we give to Things, as they\n4 please or displease us. Men are\n4 born vicious or virtuous, as Bears\n4 are born fierce, and Lambs mild.\n4 All is the Effect of an invincible\n4 Fata\n\fThe Travels os Cyrus.\n1 Fatality, and we think that we\n' chuse, only because the Sweetness\n4 of Pleasure hides the Force which\n' irresistibly draws us. This, O Sa-\n4 mians \/ is the dreadful Precipice to\n1 which he would lead you.\n4 While I am speaking the Gods\n4 declare themselves. The Thun-\n4 ders rattle, and the impetuous\n4 Winds mix and confound the Ele-\n1 ments. The whole Assembly is\n4 fill'd with Horror and Dread.

We\n* were no sooner alone, than he\n* changed his Style, and said -to\n4 me, . . - . ;\n* The Dispute between us is re-\nt duc'd to this Question 3 Whether\n4 the Eternal Nature acts with Wts*\n4 dom and Design, or takes all Sorts\n4 of Forms by a blind Necessity.\n' Let us not dazzle our Eyes with\n4 vulgar Prejudices. A Philosopher\n4 cannot believe but when he is for-\n4 ced to it by a complete Evidence.\n* I reason only upon what I see 3 and\n1 I see nothing in all Nature but an\n4 immense Matter, and an infinite\n4 \u00c6i-\n\fThe Travels of Cyrus.\n* ABivity. This aBive Matter is\nc eternal. Now an infinite aBive\n* Force must in an eternal Duration\nc of Necessity give all sorts of Forms\nc to an immense Matter. The Uni-\nc vesse, such as we see it, is one of\n* those Forms. It has had others,\n* and it will take new ones. Every\n' thing has chang'd, and does change,\n4 and will change 3 and this is enough\n' to account for the Production not\n4 only of this World, but of innu-\n\u00a3 merable Worlds.\n4 What you offer, reply'd I, is\nc nothing but Sophistry instead of\nProof. You see nothing in Na-\ne ture, say you, but an infinite Acli-\nf vity and an immense Matter. I\nc allow it : But does it follow from\nc thence, that the infinite ABruit<y is\n* a Property of Matter? Matter is\nc eternal, (add you) and it may be\n* so, because the infinite Force which\n* is always acting, may have always\nc produced\n\fThe Travels of Cyrus.\n\u2022 produced it : But do you conclude\nFrom thence that it is the only ex\nisting Substance ? I shall agree also\nthat an all-powerful Force may in\nan eternal Duration \u00a3ive all sorts\nof Forrhs to an immense Matter.\nBut is this a Proof that that Force\nacts by a blind Necessity and with\nout Design ? Tho' I stiou'd admit\nyour Principles, I must deny your\nConsequences, which seem to me\nabsolutely false. My Reasons are\nthese i\nc The tdea which we have or\"\nMatter, does not necessarily include\nthat of \u00c6rvity. Matter does not\ncease to be Matter when in a per\nfect Rest. It cannot restore Mo\ntion to it self when it has lost it.\nFrom thence I conclude, that it is\nnot a&'we of It self and: conse\nquently that infinite Forte is npt\none of its Properties;\nyoL. II; B i furthers\n\f34 J\nThe Travels\ni Cyrus.\nof\n4 Further, I perceive in my self\n' and in several Beings with which I\n4 am encompass'd, a reasoning Prin-\n4 ciple which feels, thinks, compares\n' andjudges. Now it is absurd to sup-\nf pose that Matter without Thought\n* and Sensation, can become sensible\n4 and intelligent, meerly by shifting\n* its Place: There is no Connection\n' between these Ideas. I allow that\n' the Quickness of our Sensations de-\n' pends often upon the Motion of\n* the Humours in the Body 5 and\nc this proves that Spirit and Body\n' may be united, but by no Means\n* that they are the fame ; and from\n* the whole I conclude, that there is\n* in Nature another Substance be-\n4 fides Matter, and consequently that\n' there may be a Sovereign Intelletl,\n* much superior to yours, to mine,\n' and to all those with which we are\n* acquainted.\n\fThe Travels of Cyrus.\nc In order to know whether there\n* be such an Intellect, I run over all\n' the Wonders of the Universe. I\n' observe the Constancy and Regu-\n* larity of its Laws, the Fruitfulness\n* and Variety of its Productions,\nc the Connection and Agreement of\nc its Parts, the Conformation of A-\nt nimals, the Structure of Plants,\n1 the Order of the Elements, and\nc the Revolutions of the Heavenly\nc Bodies. I cannot doubt but that\n* all is the Effect of Art, Contri-\n' vance, and an infinite Wisdom.\n* And from this I conclude, that the\n' infinite Force which you acknow-\n1 ledge to be in Nature, is a sove-:\n' reign Mind.\n' I remember, said Cyrus, ( inter-\ni rupting him here) that Zoroaster\n1 laid open to me all those Beau-\n' ties and wonderful Appearances.\n' A superficial View of them might\nD z * leave\n\fThe Travels of C y r u s.\n' leave the Mind in some Uncer-\nc tainty - but when we descend to\n' Particulars, when we enter into the\n4 Sanctuary of Nature, and study\n4 its Secrets to the Bottom, it is im-\n* possible any longer to hesitate. I\n4 do not see how Anaximander cou'd\nc resist the Force of your Arguments.\n' How did he answer you ?\nc After having laid before him,\ni reply d Pythdgoras, the Motives\nc which indued me to believe, I de-\nc sir'd him to tell me his Objections.\n' A Being infinitely wisse and pow-\nc erful, sard he, must have all kinds\n8 of Perfection. His Goodness must\nc be answerable to his Wisdom, and\n' his Justice equal to his Power.\n* ^Nevertheless , according to your\nc System, the Univ\u00a7rse is full of Im-\nc perfections and Vices. All Na-\n4 ture abounds with Beings unhap-\n' py and wicked. Now I cannot\ni conceive\n\fThe Travels os Cyrus. 37 y\n' conceive how Sufferings and Crimes\n4 can begin or subsist: under the Em- ' ,fK\nc pire of a Being supremely good, r I y\n8 wise, and powerful. The Idea of A* \/ . .- ;\n1 a Cause infinitely perfect seems in-\n* consistent with Effects so contrary .\n. to his beneficent Nature. This is \\\n* the Reason of my Doubts.\n' How, anfwer'd I, will you de- r ,\n* ny what yqu fee clearly, because \/\/ s\nf you do not see further? The smal-\nc lest Light engages us to believe,\n. but the greatest Obscurity is not a ,> J\n' sufficient Reason for denying. In\n* this Twilight of human Life, the\n* Eye of the Understanding is too\n' weak to discover even Firji Princi-\n* pies in their perfect Evidence. We\nf only get a Glimpse os them, at a\n1 Distance, ancl, as it were, by a\n' chance Ray, which suffices to con-\n' duct us * but it is not a Light which\nf dispels all Obscurity. Will yon\nD 3 ' reject\n\fThe Travels Cyrus.\nreject the most convincing Proofs\nof the Existence of a sovereign\nIntelligence, because you see not\nthe secret Reasons of his ConduB?\nWill you deny eternal Wisdom ,\nmeerly because you cannot con\nceive how Evil can subsist under\nits Government ? O Anaxtmander h\nis this reasoning ?\n* You do me Injustice, reply'd\nAnaxtmander. I neither affirm nor\ndeny any thing, but \/ doubt of e-\nvery thing, because I see nothing\ndemonstrated. I find my self in\nthe Necessity of fluctuating for e-\nver in a Sea of Uncertainties.\nA\n1 I perceiv'd that his Blindness\nwas going to lead him into all\nsorts of Absurdities. I ressolv'd to\nfollow him to the very brink of\nthe Precipice, and mew him all the\nHorrors of it, in order to bring\n* him\n\fThe Travels of Cyrus.\n\u20ac him back. Let us follow, said I,\n' Step by Step, the Consequences of\nf your System.\n' To demonstrate is to prove, not\n* only that a Thing is, but the Im-\nc possibility of its not being. You\nc cannot prove in this Manner the\n* Existence of Bodies. Shall this be\n' sufficient to make you doubt whe-\n' ther there are Bodies ? One may\nc demonstrate the Connection of\n4 Ideas, but Fa&s can be proved on-\n. ly by the Testimony of the Senses.\n*. To require Demonstration in Mat-\nc ters of Sensation, and to appeal to\n' Sensation where Demonstration is\n* necessary, is to over-turn the Na-\nc ture of Things. Tis the same\n* Folly as to desire to see Sounds and\nf hear Colours.\n* When there are strong Reasons,\n* for believing, and nothing obliges us\ni to doubt, the Mind should yield to\nD 4 i this\n\fThe Travel?!?\/ Cyrus.\n4 this Evidence. It is not a Geome-'\n' trical Demonstration, neither is it a\n' wfrf Probability, but such a Proof\n\u20ac as is sufficient for deciding *.\n' she Senses, said Anaxtmana^r^\nc often deceive us, and their Testi-\n4 mony is not to be relied on.. Life\n\u2022 is perhaps but a continued Dream,\n' where all is. Illusion.\n\u00a3 I agree, reply'd I, that the Sen-\n4 ses often deceive us 5 but is this a\nf Proof that they always do sq, of\n' that they are never to be rely'd on ?\ne I believe that there are Bodies, not\n\u00a3 upon the Testimony of one or\n' more Senses, but from the unani-\n4 mpus Consent of all our Sensations\n* in all Times and in all Places.\n* The Source of Pyrrhonism is frequently the not\ndistinguishing between Demonstration, Proof and Pro\nbability. A Demonstration is where the contradictory\nis impossible. A Proof where there are strong Reasons\nfor believing, and none against it. A Probability^\nwhere the Reasons for believing are stronger than those\nfox doubting. . ;\n5 Now\n\fThe Tr a vels of Cyrus. 41\n' Now as universal and immutable\n* Jdeas are Demonstrations in the\nc Sciences, so the continual Harmo-\n? ny, and almost infinite Combina-\n> tion of our Sensations are Proofs\nt in points of Fact.\nc I have brought you now, regli-\n* ed Anaximanaer, where I would\n* have you. Our Jdeas are as un-\nc certain as our Sensations. There\n* is no such thing as Demonstration,\n* or as immutable and universal\n' Truths. I know not indeecl whe-r\nc ther there exist any other Beings\nc besides my self. But if there do,\n. what appears true to some, may\n\\ seem falie to others. It does not\n' follow that a thing is true because\n* it appears so. A Mind which is\n' deceived often, may be deceived\n4 always. And this Possibility is suf-\n* ficient alone to make me doubt of\n\\ every thing.\n\fThe Travels os Cyrus,\n4 Such is the Nature of our Un-\n4 derstanding, reply'd I, that we can-\n*. not refuse to do Homage to Truth\n' when it is clearly discern'd ; we are\n4 forced to acquiesce 5 we are no longer\n4 free to doubt. Now this Impofli-\n* bility of doubting, is what Men.\n4 call Evidence, Proof Demotiftra-\n4 tion. The Mind of Man can go\nf no further.\n4 O Anaxitnander, you think that\n4 you reason better than other Men j\n4 but by too much refining you de-\n* stroy pure Reason. Observe the\n4 Inconstancy and Contradiction of\n4 your Discourse.\n* You was at first for demonflra*\n\\ ttng that there is no sovereign In-\n4 telligence. When I siiewcl you\n4 that your pretended Demonstrations\n4 were only loose Suppositions, you\n4 then took Refuge in a general\nI Doubt\n\f7he Travels of Cyrus.\n* Doubting ; and now at last your\nf Philosophy terminates in destroy-\nc ing Reason, rejecting all Evidence,\n? and maintaining that there is no'\n* Rule whereby to make any fettled\n* Judgments. It is to no purpose\nf therefore to reason longer witH\nf you\/\n' Here I was silent, to listen -to\n? what he would answer 5 but finding\nf that he did not speak, I thus resum a\n? my Discourse.\n* I suppose that you doubt feri-\n4 oustyj but is it want of Light, or\n* the Fear of being convinced, which\n' causes your Doubts ? Enter into\nf your self. Truth is better felt\nf than understood. Hearken to the\n* Voice of Nature which speaks\nf within you. She will soon rise up\n* against all your Subtilties. Your\n* Heart, which is born with an in-\n* satiable Thirst of Happiness, will\n\u00ab give\n\fTloe Travels os Cyrus.\n< give your Understanding the Lie,\nc when it rejoices in the unnatural\n* Hope of its approaching Extinction.\n1 Once again, I say, enter into your\n\u00ab self. Impose Silence upon your\n' Imagination. Purify your Heart-\nc. of its Passions, and you will there\nf find an inward Sentiment and Feel-\nf ing of the Divinity, and an invin-\nS cible Desire of Happiness, which\n4 will not suffer you to doubt. It is\n4 by hearkning to these that your Un-\n4 derstanding and your Heart will be\n* reconciled. On their Reconcile-\n* ment depends the Peace of the Soul,\n* and it is in this Tranquillity alone\n4 that we can hear the Voice of Wist\n4 dpm, which supplies the Defects\n4 of our Reasonings\/\nHere Pythagoras ceas'd, and Cy*\nxus said.\n* You join the most affecting Con*\n* federations with the most solid\n- ' Argu\n\fThe Travels of Cyrijs.\nArguments.

He found in this sacred\nBook all that was excellent in the\nLaws of Egypt, Sparta, and Athens,\nand thereby perceiv'd, that as the\nEgyptian Knowledge had been use\nful to Minos, so Lycurgus and Solon\nwere indebted to the Cretan Law\ngiver for the most valuable Parts of\ntheir Institutions: And it Was upon\nthis Model also that Cyrus sorm'd\nE z those\n\fThe Travels of Cyrus.\nthose admirable Laws, which he esta-\nblish'd in his Empire, after having\nconquer'd Asia.\nPythagoras, after this, explain'd\nto him the Form of Government of\nantient Crete, and how it provided\nequally against defpotick Power and\nAnarchy.\n1 One would think, added the\nc Philosopher, that a Government, so\n* perfect in all its Parts, should have\nc subsisted for ever.

He had a Taste for Plea\nsure, without being under its Domi\nnion. He did not dislike Magnifi\ncence, but he could refuse himself\nevery Thing, rather than oppress his\nPeople. Thus he was inaccessible to\nFlattery, and averse to Voluptuous\nness and Pomp.\nSoranes perceiv'd that there was\nno Means to preserve his Credit with\nCyrus, but by making himself neces\nsary to him. He display'd all his\nTalents, both in publick and pri\nvate Councils. He shew'd that he\nwas Master of the Secrets of the wi\nsest Policy, and above all, that he\nunderstood that Detail, which is the\nchief Science for a Minister. He\nprcpar'd and digested Matters with\nso much Order and Clearness, that\nhe left the Prince little to do.

He had a Confidence in his\nfather's Ministers,but would not blind\nly yield himself up to their Conduct.'\nWhen Soranes perceiv'd that the\nPrince would himself see every Thing\nto the Bottom, he study'd to throw\nObscurity over the most important\nAffairs, that he might make himself\nyet more necessary. But Cyr us manag'd\nchis able and jealous Minister with fa\nmuch Delicacy, that he drew from\nhim by degrees, what he endeavour'd\nso artfully to conceal. When the\nPrince thought himself sufficiently in\nstructed, he let Soranes see, that he\nwould himself be his Father's first\nMinister 5 and in this Manner, he\nredue'd that Favourite to his proper\nPlace, without giving him any just\nCause of Complaint.\nSoranes s Ambition was nevefthe-\nthelefs\n\fTravels of Cyrus.\ntheless offended by this Conduct of\nCyrus. His Pride could not bear,\nwithout mortal Uneasiness, to see his\nCredit lessening, and himself no lon\nger necessary. This was the first\nSource of his Discontent, which might\nhave prov'd fatal to Cyrus, if his\nVirtue, Prudence and Address had\nnot presserv'd him from its Effects.\nPersia had for some Ages been in\nSubjection to Media, but upon the\nMarriage of Cambyses with Manda-\nna, it had been stipulated that the\nKing of Persia should for the fu\nture pay only a small annual Tri\nbute as a Mark of Homage.\nFrom that Time the Medes and\nPersians had lived in perfect Amity,\ntijl the Jealousy of Cyaxares kindled\nthe Fire of Discord. The Median\nPrince was incessantly calling to mind,\nwith Vexation, the Oracles which\nVol. II.

He was every Mo\nment sollicking Aflyages, to prevent\nthose fatal Predictions, to weaken\nthe Strength of Persia, and to re\nduce it to its former Dependance.\nMandana, while she liv'd had so\ndextrously manag'd her Father, as to\nhinder an open Rupture between\nhim and Cambyfes. But as soon as she\nwas dead, Cyaxares renew'd his Sol\nicitations with the Median Emperor.\nCambyfes was inform'd of Cyax-\naress Designs, and sent Hyjlafpes to\nthe Court of Ecbatan , to represent\nto Aftyages the Danger of mutually\nweakening each other's Power, while\nthe Affyriam, their common Enemy,\nwere\n\fThe T RAVELS of CYRtJS.\nwere forming Schemes, to extend\ntheir Dominion over all the East.\nHyftajpes, by his Address, put a\nStop to the Execution of Cyaxaress\nProjects, and gain'd Cambyses Time\nto make his Preparations* in ease of\na Rupture.\nThe Prince of Media, seeing that\nthe wise Counsels of Hyfiaspes were\nfavourably listen'd to by his Father,\nand that there was no Means sudden\nly to kindle a War, attempted by\nother Ways to weaken the Power of\nPersia. Being inform'd of Soranes's\nDiscontent, he endeavour'd to gain\nhim, by an Offer of the first Dig*\nnities of the Empire.\nSoranes at first was shock'd at the\nvery Thought $ but afterwards being\ndeceiv'd by his Resentment, he knew\nnot himself the secret Motives up\non which he acted.

There is nothing which we\ncannot persuade our selves to think,\nwhen blinded and drawn away by\nstrong Passions. Thus he came by\ndegrees into a strict Correspondence\nwith Cyaxares, and secretly employ'd\nall Means to render Cyrus's Admini\nstration odious to the Persians.\nCyrus had rais'd Araspes to the\nfirst Dignities in the Army, upon\nAccount of his Capacity and Talent\nfor War : But he would not bring\nhim into the Senate, because the\nLaws and Customs of Persia did not\nallow Strangers to sit in the supreme\nCouncil.

In order thereto, they\nembrac'd, or forsook the literal Sense\nof the sacred Books, according as it\nsuited with their Notions, or was re\npugnant to them. They taught,\n2 that\n\f144 The Travels of Cy\nthat the Hebrew Traditions were of\nten folded up in Allegories, accord\ning to the Eastern Custom ; but they\npretended to explain them. This\nwas what gave Rife afterwards to that\nfamous Sect among the Hebrews,\ncall'd the \u00c6egorijls.\nEleazer was of the Number of\nthose Philosophers, and was, with\nReason, esteem'd one of the greatest\nGerimis of his Age. He was vers'd\nin all the Sciences of the Chaldeans\nand Egyptians, and had held several\nDisputes with the Eastern Magi, to\nprove, that the Religion of the \"Jews\nwas not only the most antient, but\nthe most conformable to Reason.\n4\nCyrus having divers times discours'd\nwith Eleazer, upon all he had learnt\nin Persia, Egypt, and Greece, con\ncerning the great Revolutions which\nhadhappen'd in the Universe, desir'd\nhim one Day to explain to him the\nDoc\n\fThe Travels Cyrus.\nDoctrine of the Hebrew Philosophers,\nconcerning the three States or the\nWorld.\nc We adore, answered Eleazer,\n' but One only God, infinite, eternal\n4 immense.

The whole\n* Universe, and the vast Expanse of\n4 Nature, distinct from the divine\n4 Essence, is produc'd.\nf The Creator has represented\n* himself two ways, by simple Pic-\ne tures, and by living Images. Hence\n4 there are two sorts of Creatures es-\n4 sentially different, materialNature,\nc and intelligent Nature. The one\n4 represents only some Perfections of\n4 its Original. The other knows\nc and enjoys it. There are an in-\n4 finite Number of Spheres, full of\n4 such intelligent Beings.\n4 Sometimes these Spirits plunge\nt them\n\fThe Travels (?\/ Cyrus.\"\nthemselves into the unfathomable\nDepths of the Divine Nature, to\nadore its Beauties, which are ever\nnew. At other times they ad\nmire the Perfections of the Crea\ntor in his Works. This is their\ntwo-fold Happiness.

It is He^ who is the Head,\nt and\n\fThe Travels^\/ Cyrus. iji\n' and the Conductor of all intelligent\nc Natures. He is the First-born or all\nc Creatures. The Deity has united\n' himself to him in an intimate\n* manner, from the Beginning of\n' the World. It is He, who con-\n4 vers'd with our Fathers under a\n4 human Form.

To conclude, it is He, who\n' will come in Triumph upon the\nc Clouds, to restore the Universe to\n* its primitive Splendor and Felicity.\n' The Foundation of the whole\n4 Law, and of all the Prophecies, is\n* the Idea of A Nature, sure in in\nL 4 ' On-\n\fThe Travels of Cyrus.\n\u00a3 Original, corrupted by Sin, and to\nf be one Day reftor'd.'\nCyrus, almost transported with hear\ning this Account, was unwilling to in\nterrupt the Philosopher 5 but seeing that\nhe had done speaking, he said, 4 You\n4 give me a much higher Idea of the\n' Divinity, than the Philosophers of\n* other 'Nations. They have repre-\n4 sented the first Principle to me,\n' only as a sovereign Intellect,\n' who separated and reduc'd to Or-\n4 der, the Chaos of an eternal Mat-\n' ter. But you teach me, that He\n* who is, has not only regularly\n' dispos'd that Matter, but producd\n4 it 3 that he has given it Beings as\n< well as Motion-, and has fill'd his\n4 Immensity with new Subftances, as\n* well as new Forms. The Ami*\n* liBes, Jyngas, Co\/mogoges, all the\ni Genii which inhabit the Empyre-\n' urn, and all the subordinate Divi-\n' nities, ador'd in other Countries,\n* are\n\fThe Tr a vels of CyrusJ i\nare not Parts of his Substance, but\nImages of his Greatness, and mere\nEffects of his Power. You shew\nme, that in all Nature there is\nbut one supreme Deity, who gives\nExistence, Life and Reason to all\nBeings. This then is the God of\nIsrael, so superior to those os all\nother Nations.\n\u00a3 I see that the Doctrine of the\n< Persians, Egyptians, and Greeks,\n' concerning the three States of the\n* World, is perfectly conformable\n' to your Theology.\n\u00a3 Zoroaster, being instructed in\n\u00a3 the Sciences of the Gymnosophifis,\n* spoke to me of the first Empire of\n* Oromazes, before the Rebellion of\ni ArimaniUs, as of a State in which\n* Spirits Were happy and perfect. In\n* Egypt, the Religion of Hermes\nc represents the Reign of Osiris, be-\nJ fore the Monster Typhon broke\n. through\n\f154 The Travels of Cyrus.\n' through the Mundane Egg, as a\n4 State exempt from Miseries and\ni Passions. Orpheus has fung the\n4 ' golden Age as a State of Simplici-\n' ty and Innocence. Each Nation\n4 has formed an Idea of this primitive\n* World, according to its Genius.\n4 The Magi, who are all Astrono-\n4 mers, have plac'd it in the Stars.\n\u00a3 The Egyptians, who are all Philo-\n' fophers, have fancy'd it A Repub-\ni lick of Sages. The Greeks, who\n' delight in rural Scenes, have de-\n4 fcrib'd it as A Country of Shep-\n4 herds.\nc The Sibyls have foretold the\n4 coming of a Hero, who is to\n* descend from Heaven, to bring\n\u00a3 back AJir\u00e6a to the Earth. The\n* Persians call him Mythras 5 the\n* Egyptians, Orus-, the Greeks, Jupi-\n4 ter, the ConduBor, and Saviour. It\n* is true they differ in their Descripti-\n* ons, but all agree in the same Truths.\nz t They\n\fThe Travels -of Cyrus. i\nThey are all sensible, that Man is\nnot now what he was, and believe\nthat he will one Day assume a\nmore perfect Form. God cannot\nsuffer an eternal Blemish in his\nWork. Evil had a Beginning, and\nit will have an End. Then will\nbe the Triumph of Light over\nDarkness. That is the Time fix'd\nby Destiny, for the total Destruc\ntion of Typhon, Arimanius, and\nPluto. That is the prescrib'd Pe\nriod for re-establishing the Reign\nof Oromazes, Osiris and Saturn.\n4 Nevertheless, there arises one\nc great Difficulty, which no Philo-\ni lopher has yet been able to solve\n' me. \/ do not conceive how Evil\n4 could happen under the Government\nc of a God, who is good, wife and\nc powerful. If he be wife, he might\n1 have foreseen it. If he be power-\nc ful, he might have hinder'd it :\nI And if he be good, he would have\n\f156 77je T ravels of Cyrus.\n4 prevented it. Help me to answer\nf this great Difficulty. Shew me\ni which way to justify the eternal\n4 Wisdom. Why has God created\n1 free Beings capable of Evil ? Why\n' has he beflow'd on them so fatal a\n< Gift?'\n4 Liberty, answered Eleazer, is a\n4 necessary Consequence of our rea-\n* sonable Nature. To be free, is\n4 to be able to chuse. To chuse, is\n* to prefer. Every Being capable of\n' Reasoning and Comparing can\n4 prefer, and consequently chuse.\ni This is the essential Difference be-\n4 tween Bodies and Spirits: The one\n* are neceflarily transported where-\n' ever the moving Force carries them ;\n4 The other are mov'd only by a\n\u00a3 Reason which enlightens them.\n* God could not give us Intelligence,\n* without giving us Liberty\/\n* But could he not, reply 'd Cy\u00bb\nc rusi\n\fThe T ravels of Cyrus. i\nrus, have hinder'd us from abusing\nour Liberty, by shewing us Truth\nwith so clear an Evidence, that it\nwould have been impossible to\nmistake ? When the sovereign\nBeauty displays his infinitely at\ntractive Charms, they seize and en\ngross the whole Will, and make all\ninferior Amiableness vanish, as the\nrising Sundispels theShades ofNight.\nc The purest Light, answered E'\nleazer, does not illuminate those\nwho will not see. Now, every fi\nnite Intelligence may turn his Eyes\nfrom the Truth. I have already\ntold you that Spirits cannot inces\nsantly contemplate the Splendors of\nthe divine Essence 5 they are ob-\nlig'd from time to time to cover\ntheir Faces. 'Tis then that Self-\nlove may seduce and make them\ntake an apparent Good for a real\none. And this false Good may\ndazzle and draw them away from\nz * the\n\fThe Travels o\/ Cyrus.\nthe true Good. Self-love is inse\nparable from our Nature. God,\nin loving himself, essentially loves\nOrder, because he is Order 5 but\nthe Creature may love it self with\nout loving Order 5 and hence eve\nry created Spirit is necessarily and\nessentially fallible. To ask why\nGod has made fallible Intelligences,\nis to ask why he has made them\nfinite, or why he has not created\nGods as perfect as himself ? A\nThing impossible.\n4 Cannot God, continiid Cyrus,\nemploy his Almighty Power, to\nforce free Intelligences to see and\nrelish Truth?'\n4 Under the Empire of God him\nself, answer1d Eleazer, despotick\nRule and Liberty are incompatible.\nInclination, Will, and Love, are\nnever fore'd. God does every\nThing he pleases in Heaven and\n* upon\n\fThe Travels of Cyrus. i\n' upon Earth 5 but he will not em-\nc ploy his absolute Power to destroy\nc the free Nature of intelligent Be-\n' ings. If he did so, they would\nc act no longer from Inclination and\n4 Choice, but by Force and Necefli-\nc ty. They would obey, but they\nc would not love. Now Love is\nc what God demands, and it is the\nc only Worship worthy of him. He\n' does not require it for any Advan-\n' tage to himself, but for the Good\n' of his Creatures. He will have\n' them happy, and contribute to\nc their own Happiness 3 happy by\n4 Love, and by a Love of pure\n* Choice. It is thus that their Me-\n4 rit augments their Felicity.'\nc I begin to understand you, said\nc Cyrus. Moral Evil does not come\n\u00a3 from the supremely good, wise,\nc and powerful Being, who cannot\nc be wanting to his Creatures, but\nc from the Weakness inseparable from\n* our\n\fThe Travels os Cyrus.\n4 our limited Nature, which may be\n' dazzled and deceiv'd. But what\n4 is the Cause os natural Evil 7\nt Might not the Goodness of God\n\u00a3 have brought back his offending\n' Creatures to Order, without making\n4 them suffer 7 A good Father will\n4 never make use of Punishments,\n6 when he can gain his Children by\n' Mildness\/\n4 I have already told you, an-\nc swerd Eleazer, that we are capa-\n\u00a3 ble of a twofold Happiness. If\n' God, after our Rebellion, con-\n4 tinu'd to us the Enjoyment of\n' created Pleasure, we should never\n4 aspire to an Union with the Creator.\n\u00a3 We should content our selves with\n' an inferior Happiness, without any\n4 Endeavours to attain to the su-\n* preme Beatitude of our Nature.\n4 The only Means to give free Be-\n4 ings a Diflike and Detestation of\n4 their Disorder, is to make them\n\u00a3 feel,\n\fThe Travels o\/ Cvrus. i\nc feel, for a time, the fatal Conse-\n4 quences of their wandring from\ne him. God owes it to his Justice,\n4 to punisli the Guilty, that he may\n4 not countenance Crimes 3 and his\n* Goodness likewise requires it, in\n4 order to correct and reform the\n' Criminal. Natural Evil is necef-\n4 fafy to cure moral Evil: Suf-\n* string is the only Remedy for Sw!\n* I comprehend you, said Cyrus.\n* God could not deprive Spirits of\nK Liberty, without depriving them\n4 of Intelligence nor hinder them\n' from being fallible, without mak-\n4 ing them infinite ; nor restore them\n' after their Fall, but by expiatory\n' Pains, without violating his Justice\nc and Goodness. Exempt from all\n4 Passion, he has neither Anger, nor\n4 Revenge. He chastises, only to\n4 amend j and punishes, only to\n4 cure.5\nVol. II. M [ Yes,\n\fThe Travels of Cyrus.\nf Yes, answered Eleazer, all will\n1 suffer more or less, as they are\nc more or less gone astray. Those\n' who have never departed from\nc their Duty, will for ever excel the\nc rest in Knowledge and in Happi-\n' ness. Those who delay their Re-\nL turn to it, will be always inferior\n* to the other in Perfection and Fe-\n* licity. The Return of Spirits to\n* their first Principle, resembles the\n4 Motion of Bodies towards their\nc Center. The nearer they approach\nc to it, the more their Velocity aug-\n' ments.\nThis is the Order established by\nc eternal Wisdom, the immutable\n' Law of distributive Justice, from\n* which God cannot deviate, without\n* being essentially wanting to him-\n* self, countenancing Rebellion, and\n\u00a3 exposing all finite and fallible Be-\n4 ings to the Danger of disturbing the\n' universal Harmony. t The\n\fThe Travels of Cyrus.\n' The Conduct of God' shocks\nus, only because we are finite\nand mortal. Let us raise our\nThoughts above this Place of\nBanishment. Let us run over all\nthe Celestial Regions.

These two\ninfinitely small Points will one\nDay disappear. Yet a little Mo\nment, and Evil will be no more.\nBut our limited Minds, and our\nSelf-love, magnify Objects, and\nmake us look upon that Points\nwhich divides the two Eternities, as\nsomething great.'\nc This, continued Eleazer, is what\neven the Understanding of Man can\nanswer, to justify the Ways of\nM z 'God.\n\fThe Travels of CYRtsS.\nc God. It is thus that we confound\nc Reason by Reason it self. It is by\n' these Principles that our Doctors\n' silence the Philosophers of the\n4 Gentiles, who blaspheme against\nc the sovereign Wisdom, because of\n\u00a3 the Evils and Crimes which hap-\ni pen here below. But yet our Re-\nc ligion does not consist in these\nc Speculations. It is not so much a\n' philosophical System, as a superna-\n' tural Establishment. Daniel will\n* instruct you in it.

However, the\n3Slobles of Babylon, who sat in the\nKing's Council, represented to him\nin very strong Terms That great In\nconveniences might attend the pro\nvoking the Median Court, at the\npresent Juncture, when notwithstand\ning the prudent Conduct of Amytis,\nduring the King's Illness, the For\nces of the Kingdom were much\nlessen'd,\n\fThe Tr a vels of Cyrus. i\nlefsen'd, and its Treasure exhausted :\nAnd that it would be better Policy\nto foment the Divisions between the\nMedes and Persians, in order to\nmake them mutually weaken each o-\nther's Strength, and so give the King\nof Babylon a fair Occasion of ex\ntending his Conquests.\nBut Nabuchodonofor, who by the\nMisfortunes he had sufTer'd , was\ncurd of all such false Maxims, did\nnot suffer himself to be dazzled by the\nambitious Projects of his Ministers.\nAnd Cyrus observing his good Dis\npositions, took that Opportunity to\nlay before him the Advantages he\nmight find by an Alliance with\nCambyfes. He represented to him,\nthat the Medes were the only Rivals\nof his Power in the East 5 That it\ncould not be for the Interest of the\nKing of Babylon, to let them grow\nmore considerable, by subjecting and\noppressing the Persians^ but that he\n' should\n\f170 The' Travels of Cyrus.\nshould rather make the latter his\nFriends, who might serve as a Bar\nrier to his Empire against the Enter\nprises of the Median Prince.

The\n' most sublime Act of our feeble\n* Reason, is to keep it self silent be-\n4 fore the Sovereign Reason, to sub-\n4 mit, and to leave to God the Care\n4 of justifying, one Day, the in-\n4 comprehensible Ways of his Pro-\n1 vidence. Our Pride and Impatience\n' will not suffer us to wait for this\n' Unravelling. We would go before\n4 the Light, and by so doing we\n4 lose the Use of it.\n4 Forget therefore all the subtle\n' Speculations of the Doctors. I\n4 shall speak to you a more sure and\n4 simple Language. I shall propose\n\fThe Travels of Cyrus.\nnothing to you but palpable Facts,\nof which the Eyes, Ears, and all\nthe Senses of Men are Judges.\n\u00a3 You have already learn'd by\nthe universal Doctrine of all Na\ntions, that Man is fallen from the\nPurity of his Original. By dis\ncontinuing to be just, he ceas'd to\nbe immortal. Sufferings follow'd\nclose upon Crimes, and Men were\ncondemn d to a State of Pain and\nMisery, in order to make them\nbreathe perpetually after a better\nLife.\n\u00a3 For the first Ages after the Fall,\nReligion was not written. The\nmoral Part of it was found in Reason\nit self, and the Mysteries of it were\ntransmitted by Tradition from the\nAntients. As Men liv'd then se\nveral Ages, it was easy to preserve\nthat Tradition in its Purity.\n< But\n\fThe Travels of Cyrus.\n4 But the sublime Knowledge os\nthe first Men having serv'd only to\nincrease the Corruption of their\nHearts, the whole Race of Man\nkind, except one Family, was de\nstroys, in order to stop the Course\nof Impiety, and the multiplying of\nVices. The Fountains of the great\nAbyss were broken up, and the\nWaters cover'd the Earth with an\nuniversal Deluge, of which there\nare yet some Traces in all Na\ntions. The Constitution of the\nWorld, which had been chang'd by\nthe Fall, was impair'd a-new. The\nJuices of the Earth were impo\nverish'd and spoilt by this Inunda\ntion. The Herbs and Fruits had\nno longer the same Virtue. The\nAir, loaded with an excessive Moi\nsture, strengthned the Principles of\nCorruption, and the Life of Man\nwas sliortned.\n.' From\n\fThe Travels of Cyrus. 177\n4 The Descendants of Noah, who\n' spread themselves over the Face\n4 of the whole Earth, quickly forgot\n4 him who made them ; they corrupt-\n* ed their Ways, and gave themselves\n* up to all Wickedness.\n* It was then that the Eternal\n* chose a peculiar People to be the\n* Depositary of Religion, Morality,\n4 and all divine Truths, that they\n4 might not be debas'd, and intirely\n4 obscur d, by the Imagination, Pas-\n* sions, and vain Reasonings of Men.\n' Abraham, by his Faith and\n4 Obedience, was found worthy to\n? be the Head and the Father of this\n4 bappy People.

The High\nand Lofty One, who inhabits Eter\nnity, condescends to dwell amongst\nthe Children of Israels and to di\nrect them in all their Ways.

God gives them a\nKing in his Anger. Saul is the first\nof our Monarchs; he proves diso\nbedient, and is rejected. He is\nsucceeded by David, the Man as\nter God's own Heart, who extends\nhis Conquests, and the Throne is\nestablish^ in his Family $ yet he is\nnot permitted to build a Temple\nto the Lord at Jerusalem.

Nevertheless he\n* chastises them like a Father, and\n< does not utterly forsake them. la\nc every Age he raises up Prophets,\n* who threaten, instruct, and reform\n' us.

At length\n' they are wholly carried away by\nc that wretched Inclination in all Mor-\n* tals to corporalize the Deity, and\n' to form to themselves a God with\n* Passions like their own. The God\n4 of Abraham, faithful in hisThreat-\n* nings as in his Promises, has hum-\n' bled us for many Years under the\n' Yoke of Nabuchodonosor. Jeru~\n' salem is become desolate, and the\n* Holy Temple a Heap of Stones.\n4 Vagabonds and Captives in a strange\n* Land, we wander upon the Banks\n* ofthe Euphrates, and silently mourn,\n* when we remember Sion.\n8 But God having first made use\n* of that proud Conqueror to accom-\n* plifh his eternal Purposes, then a-\n* based him in his Anger.

''\nThe Prince ofPersia was astonish'd\nat this Discourses. His Mind fluctuated\nbetween so many Proofs and Ib much\nQbscurity. He saw the Truth only\nthrough a Cloud , and did not yet\ncomprehend the Grandeur and Digs\nhity of the Hebrew Law; and there\nfore laic} to Daniel,\nBut what is the Design of this\nLaw, dictated by God himself with\nso much Pomp, preserved by your\nFore-Fathers with so much Care, re-\nnew'd and confirm'd by your Prophets\n\fThe Travels of Cyrus? '\nwith so many Miracles ? In what does\nit differ from the Religion of other\nNations ?\n1 The Design of the JLaw and\n\u00a3 the Prophets, reply'd Daniel, and\nc of all the Parts of our Worship,\nc is to shew, That all Creatures\n' were pure in their Original, and\n' had nothing contagious or mortal\n' in them 5 That all Men are at\n' present born sick, corrupt, and ig-\nc norant, even to the Degree of\n' not knowing their Disease 5 and That\nc human Nature cannot be restor'd to\n' its Perfection, but by the Coming\n4 of a MeJJiah. All the Ceremonies\n4 and Sacrifices of our Religion are\n* but the Shadows of these three\n* Celestial Truths. The History of\nc our Nation is writ with such divine\n* Art, that the Facts, strictly true\nc in themselves, are likewise Images\n* of those other Truths. The Bon-\n* dage of the Israelites in Egypt ;\n^ their\n\fThe Travels of Cyrus.\n4 their Journey through the Desert,\n1 and their Arrival in the promis'd\n4 Landj represent to us the Fall of\n' Souls, their Sufferings in this mor-\n* tal Life, and their Return to their\n' heavenly Country. All other Na-\n4 tions have their Allegories, we have\n' ours. Those who stop at the Letter,\n* are sometimes offended : They\n' find Expressions, which seem too\n' much to humanize, and even\n'Ho corporalize, the Divinity. But\n' the true Sage penetrates their pro-\n\u00a3 found Meaning, and discovers\n* Mysteries of the highest Wisdom.\n' These three Ideas, the Traces of\n4 which are to be observ'd in all\n4 Religions, have been transmitted\n4 from Age to Age, from the De-\n* luge to our Time. Noah taught\n4 them to his Children, whose Po-\n4 sterity spread them afterwards over\n' all the Earth. But in passing from\n4 Mouth to Mouth, they have been\ni alters\n\f7^ Travels of Cyrus.\nalter'd arid obscur'd, by the Imagi*\nnation of the Poets, the Supersti\ntion of the Priests, and the different\nGenius of each Nation. We fintt\nmore remarkable Footsteps of them\namong the Eastern Nations and the\nEgyptians, than any where else;\nbecause Abraham, our first Patri\narch, was famous in Asia-, and\nbecause the People of God were a\nlong time in Captivity, on the\nBorders of the Nile. But those\nantient Truths have been no where\npreserv'd in their perfect Purity,\nexcept in the Oracles written by\nour Law-giver, our Historians, and\nour Prophets.\nc But this is not all. There is *\nMystery peculiar to our Religion,\n\u2022of which 1 would not speak to you,\nO Cyrus, if you. were not the An\nointed of The Most High, ami\nhis Servant, chosen for the Delivef\nance of his People.\n. The\n\fThe Travels of Cyrus.\n\u20ac The Prophecies mention two\n1 Advents of the Messiah : One in\n* Sufferings the other in Glorym\n* The Desire of all Nations will,\nc many Ages before his triumphant\nc Appearance in the Clouds, live here\n' upon Earth in a State of Humilia-\n' tidn. He will expiate Sin by the Sacri-\n' flee of himself, before he restores the\n' Universe to its primitive Splendor.\n1 God has no need of a bloody\nf Victim to appease his Wrath. But\n' he would offend his Justice, if he\n1 pardon'd the Criminal without\n' shewing his Abhorrence of the\n' Crime. This is what the Mes-\n' siah will do. The great Emanuel,\n* God-Man, will descend upon\n' Earth, to {hew by his Sufferings the\n* infinite Aversion of The Most\n1 High, to the Violation of Order.\nc 'Tis thus that he will reconcile the\ni divine Justice and Mercy.\n* I sec\n\fThe Travels of CyrusI\nc I see from far that Day which\n' will be the Consolation of the Just,\nc and the Joy of Angels. All the\n4 heavenly Powers, all the Spirits\nft who inhabit Immensity, will be\n' present at this Mystery, and adore\n* its Depth. Mortals will fee no-\n' thing but the Shell and the Out-\n* side, the Sufferings of a Man of\nc Sorrows, and acquainted with\n* Grief: But we shall be healed by\n* his Wounds. This is the great My-\n4 stery unknown in all other Religi-\n* ons, because none but that of the\n* Hebrews teaches what is due to the\nc infinite Purity of the divine Nature.\nc Those Jews who expect only\ne a triumphant Messiahs will not\n* comprehend this first Advent.\nc The Pretenders to Wisdom in all\nc Nations , who judge only by\n*. Appearances, will blaspheme a-\n* gainst what they understand not.\n-'Nay,\n\fThe Travels of Cyrus. i\n* Nay, The most just among Men\n4 will, in thts Life, fee, only as\n4 .through a Cloud, the Beauty* Ex-\n4 tent, and Necessity, of that Great\n4 Sacrifice.\n4 At length the Messiah will come\nc in his Glory, to renew the Face of\n4 the Earth, and restore the Universe\nx to its primitive Brightness. Then all\n4 Spirits, in Heaven, on Earth, and\n* in Hell below, will bow the Knee\n4 before him.

Books,\n4 Prodigies, and Prophecies like these,\n' are not to be found elsewhere.\n4 O Cyrus, reply d Daniel, you\n4 do not comprehend these Truths\n4 in all their Extent. Religion is\n* not a System of Philosophical O-\n* pinions, nor yet a History of Mira-\n*' cles, or supernatural Events 3 but\n4 an experimental Science which\n4 God reveals only to Souls who\n4 love Truth for its own sake. We\n4 may admire its Doctrines, and be\n* struck with its Prodigies, and yet\n4 be Strangers to its Spirit.

According to him, Cyrus went\nto the Court of Media, at i z Tears of Age;\nJlay'd there 4 Tears, returnedin hissixteenth\nTear, entered into the Class of the \"Etpqfioi or\nYoung-men, in his seventeenth, and conti\nnued in it 1 o Tears : to which he adds that\nAstyages died in this Interval. But this\nis not true ; for that Trince reigned till he\nwas conquered by Cyrus, in the Tear 560,\nand did not die till some Tears after. Ton\nhave therefore done well in not following\nXenophon.\nAccording to him, Cyrus enter'd Media\nat the Head of 30000 Men, when he was\n2 8 Tears of Age } subdued the Armenians\nat 29 ; marched against the Lydians, and\ntook Sardis, at 30 ; and made himself Master\nc\/'Babylon, at 3 3, about theTear 5 67. This\nis the 179th Tear of Nabonassar, and the\n3 6th oj Nabuchodonosor, who reignedseven\nTears after it. These 7 Tears added to\nthe 2 1 Tears of the four Kings who reigned\nin Babylon after him, make the 28 Tears\nof the Anachronifm abovementioned.\nThe rest of Xenophon'.?

Ph\u0153nician Annals, which jofephus had\nread. In the Tear Jerusalem was taken,\nwhich was the i %th tear of Nabuchodono\nsor, the Prophet Ezechiel threatens Tyre\nwith approaching ruin it therefore was\nnot taken at that time. Cyrus was then\n1 5 Tears of Age. Now, as the Time when\nCyrus met with Amenophis again at Tyre,\nmight be about i 5 Tears later than this }\nand as the Travels of Cyrus are allplaced\nbetween the 28th and 3 id Tear of his Age ;\nyou are therefore guilty of no Anachronism\nin this particular.\nWe have no where any express 'Passage,\nwhereby to fix the Time of Nabuchodono-\nfov's Madness. That he was mad, is cer\ntain, from Daniel : And it is veryprobable, it\nhappened towards the End of his Life.

This was the 14.8th Tear ofNz-\nbonassar, the $6\\th before Christ, and the\nlllhof Qyixxgs Age-, at which time Nabu-\nchodonosor was yet alive-, since he did not\ndie till the issth of Nabonassar, and the\n39th of Cyrus. Evilmerodach therefore did\nnot only mount the Throne in his Father's\nLifetime, but he governed without consult\ning him, and with so little dependance up\non him, as not to fear provoking him, by\ntaking quite different Measures from his,\nand heaping Honours on a 'Prince, whom\nhis Father had all along kept in Fetters.\nBerosus makes the Prince, whom he calls\nEvilmerodach to have reigned 10 Tears.\nThe Astronomical Canon allows him but\ntwo, and calls him Ilovarodam. The Scrip\nture places him upon the Throne, three Tears\nbefore the 'Death of his Father.\nAll these Difficulties will vanish if we\nsuppose, that NabuchodonosorV Madness\n. (5) Chap. lii. ver 31.

Ces 8 ans joints aux deux qu'il reg\nna seul apres la mort de Nabucodonofor\nfont les dix ans de Berosc.

La demence de ce\nPrince ne dura que sept ans, & ayant re\ncouvert son bon sens, il gouverna parluy\nm\u00eame & donna un Edit en faveur des Juifs\nqui est rapport\u00e9 dans Daniel. Ou n'avoit\njamais celle de mettre son nom dans les\nactes publics; c'est pour cela que le Canon\nastronomique ne donne que deux ans de\nRegne \u00e0 son fils Ilovarodam. Ce Canon avoit\net\u00e9 dress\u00e9 fur les actes publics.\nLa demence de Nabucodonofor a d\u00fb pro\nduire de grandes revolutions \u00e0 la Cour de\nBabylone, & nous pouvons nons en former\nune Id\u00e9e, fur ce qui se passa \u00e0 la Cour\nde France pendant celle de Charles VI. o\u00f9\nles affaires etoient tant\u00f4t entre les mains\nde fa femme, tant\u00f4t entre celles de ses En-\nfans, tant\u00f4t entre celles des Grands Seig\nneurs & des Princes de son Sang.\nSuivant\n\fC)\nbegan 8 Tears before his Death, and that\nhis Son Evilmcrodac was from that Time\nlooked upon as King, placed himself at the\nHead of Affairs, and governed the Em\npire with his Father's Ministers. These\n8 Tears, joined with the two he reigned\nalone ajter his Father's Death, make up\nthe 10 Tears of Berosus. The Holy Scrip\ntures begin his Reign later, doubtless from\nthe Time that he removed the Ministers,\nwho made him uneasy, which didnot happen\ntill the third Tear before the Death of Na-\nbuchodonosor. This 'Prince's Madness con\ntinued but 7 Tears after that time he re\ncovered his Senses, reajfumed the govern\nment, and published an Edifl in favour of\nthe Jews, which is related in Daniel. His\nName had all along been made Use of in\nthe publick Acts ; and for this Reason, the\nAstronomical Canon makes his Son Ilova-\nrodam to have reigned but z Tears. This\nCanon was drawn up from thepublick Acts.\nNabuchodonosorV Madness must have\nproduced great Revolutions, in the Court of\nBabylon, and we mayform an Idea of them,\nfrom what passed at the Court ^France,\nduring that of Charles VI: when the Ma\nnagement of Affairs was sometimes lodged\nin the Hands of the Queen, sometimes in\nthose of her Children, and sometimes in\nthose of the great Lords and Primes of\nthe Blood.\nP 3 Upon\n\f(9)\nSuivant cette Supposition egalement sim\nple & necessarie la demence de Nabucodo-\nnosor sera arriv\u00e9e l'an de Nabonassar 179,\navant J. C. 5 69e & la j ie. ann\u00e9e de la Vie\nde Cyrus. Ce Prince doit en avoir et\u00e9 in\nstruit, car cet Evenement etoit d'une gran\nde Importance. On ne peut m\u00eame douter\nqu'il n'ait influ\u00e9 dans la Guerre des Medes\n& des Perses. Les Babyloniens ctoient al\nliez des Medes & de leurs Roys, car Nabu>\ncodonosor avoit Epous\u00e9 une Fille d'Asty-\nages. Ils auroient pris quelque part a cet\nte Guerre, fans la Mediation d'Amytis, qu'on\npeut supposer avoir travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 concilier les\nMedes & les Perses; fans la foiblefle du\nGouvernement des Babyloniens caus\u00e9e par\nla demence de leur Roy; & sans les Divi\nsions qui regnoient \u00e0 la cour entre les dif-\nferens Partis qui se disputoient la premiere\nPlace dans les Conseils.\nLe Spectacle d'un Conquerant si fameux\nreduit dans cet Etat deplorable etoit bien\ncapable d'instruire Cyrus, & vous avez eu\ngrande Raison de ne le pas negliger. Cy\nrus revint de ces Voyages selon votre Chro\nnologie vers la 32\" ann\u00e9e de son Age. La\ndemence de Nabucodonofor etoit deja\ncommenc\u00e9e. Il palTe pres de sept ans dans\nla Perse gouvernant fous son pere. C'est\npendant cet Espace de Temps qu'arrivent\ntoutes les Intrigues entre Cyaxare & So-\nranes, que Cambyfe fait la Guerre aux\nMedes\n\f( 9 )\nUpon this Supposition, which is both easy\nand necessary, Nabuchodonosor'j Madness\nwill have happened, in the 179 Tear of Na-\nbonassar, the 569th before Christ, and the\n3 zd of Cyrus. This 'Prince must have been\ninformed of that Event, for it was of great\nImportance to him to know it- It is not to\nbe doubtedbut it had its Influence in the War\nof the Medes and Persians. The Babyloni\nans were alliedto the Medcs andtheirKings :\nFor Nabuchodonosor hadmarried a Daugh\nter of Astyages. They would have taken some\n'Part in this War, {had it not been for the\nMediations Amytis ; whom we maysuppose\nto have labour'd to reconcile the Medes and\nPersians;) the Weakness of the Babylonian\nGovernment; occasionedby the Madness ofthe\nKing, and the Divisions which prevailed\nat Court, among the different ^Parties, who\ncontendedfor the Direction ofAffairs.\nThe Sight of fa famous a Conqueror re\nduced to so deplorable a Condition, must\nhave been a very proper Spectaclefor the In\nstruction of Cyrus, andyou hadgreat Rea\nson not to neglect it. He returned from\nhis Travels, according to your Chronology,\nabout the 3 id Tear of his Age, after Naba-\nchodonosor'x Madness had already seized\nhim. Cyrus spent 7 Tears, under his Fa\nther's Government, in Persia, during which\nTime, all the Intrigues between Cyaxares\nand Soranes were carried on-, Cambyses\nP 4 made\n\fC 10)\nMcdes; qu'Astyages meurt & que Cyrus va\n\u00e0 Babylone pour negotier avec Amytis vers\nla fin de la Maladie de Nabucodonofor. Ce\nTemps est bien choisy pour rendre le Spec\ntacle plus touchant & plus Instructif.\nVotre Chronologie fur les Evenemens\npolitiques & fur les Revolutions arriv\u00e9es\ndu Temps de Cyrus est donc parfaitement\nconforme \u00e0 celle des Grecs, des Babyloni\nens, & des Hebreux. Examinons mainte\nnant si les Grands Hommes que vous faites\nvoir \u00e0 Cyrus pendant ses Voyages ont et\u00e9\nses Contemporains. Vous^pouvez vous\npermettre un peu plus de Libert\u00e9 dans le\nsecond cas que dans le premier.\nVous savez combien les anciens font op\nposez entre eux sur le Temps o\u00f9 Zoroastre\na v\u00e9cu, ce qui vient fans doute de ce que\nl'on a donn\u00e9 le nom de Zoroastre \u00e0 tous\nceux qui ont reform\u00e9 en differens temps la\nReligion des Mages: Le dernier est le plus\nfameux de tous, & le seul qui ait et\u00e9 connu\nfous ce nom ou fous celuy de Zardoufcht\nparles Orientaux, Mr. Prideaux le fait Con-\ntemparain de Cambyfe &*de Darius fils\nd'Hystafpe.

This time\nwas judiciously chosen, to make the Sight\nmore affecting and instructive.\nTour Chronology, with regard to politi\ncal Affairs, and the Revolutions which\nhappened in Cyrus's Time, is therefore per\nfectly agreeable to that of the Greeks, Eaby-\nlonians, and Hebrews. Let us now enquire,\nwhether the Great Men, whom you make\nCyrus to have seen in his Travels; were\nhis Cotemporaries. Tou may indeed be al\nlowed a greater Liberty in this Cafe than\nin the former.\nTou know how the Antients contradict one\nanother with regard to the Time when Zo-\nroaster lived; which doubtlessproceeds from\nhence, that the Name of Zoroaster was\ngiven to all those, who, at different Times,\nreform d the Religion of the Magi. The\nlast of these was the most famous, and\nis the only one, who is known by that Name,\nor by the Name of Zardouscht, in the East.\nPrideaux makes him cotemporarywith Cam-\nbyses, and Darius the Son of Hyfttfpcs But\nit is very probable he livedsome Time before\nthem.\nThe Eastern Writers, as may be seen in\n'Dr. Hyde'* Work, make him to have lived\nunder\n\fr\u00bb;\nGustaspes, ou Hystaspes pere de Darab qui\nest le Darius premier des Grecs. Ce Gus\ntaspes etoit plus \u00e2g\u00e9 que Cyrus, & pou-\nvoit \u00eatre le m\u00eame que celuy que vous faites\nson Gouverneur. D'o\u00f9 il i\u00f9it necessaire\nment que la reforme de la Religion des\nMages a du se faire pendant le Regne de\nce Prince, & que c'etoit alors que Zoroa\nster vivoir. La Reforme faite par Darius\nsuppose que les Mages s'etoient arrog\u00e9s une\ntres grande Autorit\u00e9 dont il les depouilla. Il\naltera m\u00eame la puret\u00e9 de la Religion de\nZoroastre par le melange de l'Idol\u00e2trie\nEstrangerc. Ce fut fous son Regne que le\nCulte d'Anaitis s'introduisit dans la Per se, &\ncela ne s'accom ode pas avec les Hypothe\nses de Mr. Prideaux. Le Party que vous\navez pris est plus conform\u00e9 \u00e0 la fuite de\nl'Histoire telle qu'elle resuite des faits qui\nsons communs aux Grecs, & aux Historiens\nPersans & Arabes.\nCyrus a p\u00fb epouser Cassandane a l'Age\nde 18 ans, & vivre avec elle neuf ou dix\nans; de cette fa\u00e7on il a p\u00fb passer en Egypte\nvers la 29e Ann\u00e9e de son Age. Votre\nChronologie s'accorde parfaitment avec\nl'Age d'Amal\u00ees. Son Regne a finy de l'aven\nde tous le Chronologistes un an avant\nl'Expedition de Cambysc, c'est \u00e0 dire vers\nl'an 525 avant J. Christ, & la 63e Olym\npiade. Herodote ne donne que 4+ ans de\ndur\u00e9e\n\f(II )\nunder Gustaspes or Hystaspes, the Father of\nDarab, who is the first Darius of the Greeks.\nThis Gustaspes was older than Cyrus, and\nmay have been the fame Ter\nson, whom you\nmake his Governor. Whence it necessarily\nfollows, that the Reformation of the Re\nligion of the Magi must have been made\nduring his Reign, and that Zoroaster lived\nat that Time. The Reformation made by\nDarius supposes that the Magi had assumed\nto themselves very great Authority, which\nhe took away from them. He likewise cor\nrupted the 'Purity of Zoroaster's Religion,\nby a Mixture of foreign Idolatry. In his\nReign, the ffbrjhip of Anaitis was first\nbrought into Persia, contrary to the Hypo\ntheses of Dr. Prideaux. Tour Scheme\nis more agreeable to the Course of the\nHistory, as it results from those Faffs,\nwhich are related by the Persian and\nArabian Historians, as well as by the Gre\ncian.\nCyrus may have married Cassandana at\n1 8 Tears of Age, and have lived with her\nnine or ten Iears j so that he may have tra\nvelled into Egypr, about the 29th Tear of\nhis Age. Tour Chronology agrees exaiJfy\nwith the Age of Amasis. All Chronologists\nagree, that his Reign ended a Tear before\nCambyscs'j Expedition, that is about the\nSiSth Tear before Christ, and the 63 ^Olym\npiad. Herodotus makes bis Reign to have\nlasted\n\ffi\u00bb;\ndur\u00e9e au Regne d'Amafis, & par Conse\nquent il le fait commencer en Tann\u00e9e 569\navant Jesus Christ & \u00e0 la 52 Olympiade,\nvers la 30e ann\u00e9e de Cyrus.\nDiodore qui donne 5 5 ans de Regne \u00e0\nAmasis suppose qu'il monta sur le Throne\nl'an 579 ou 580 avant l'Ere Chretienne,\n& la 20 ann\u00e9e de l'Age de Cyrus : Mais\nces deux Opinions font faciles \u00e0 concilier.\nHerodote a commenc\u00e9 le Regne d'Amafrs\n\u00e0 la fin de la Revolution qui le mit fur le\nThrone, & Diodore a compt\u00e9 du Commen\ncement de fa Revolte.\nApries vivoit encore peu apr\u00e8s la prise\nde Jerusalem puisque le Prophete Jeremie (*)\npredit sa mort sous le nom de Pharaon Ho-\nphra, comme un evenement qui devoit arri\nver dans' peu de Temps.

He had a Ge\nnius capable of going to the bottom\nof any Subject whatever : but he\nwrote sometimes in a hurry, and\ntreated superficially the gravest and\nmost important Subjects. Besides,\nthere is no clearing him from the\nCharge of loving too much the dis\nmal Obscurity of Scepticism. He is\nalways upon his guard against the\npleasing Ideas of Immortality. He\nsliews with Art and Subtlety all the\ndark\n\fio Os the Theology\ndark Sides of a Question: but he\nvery rarely represents it in that Point\nof Light, which shines with Evidence.\nWhat Encomiums would he not have\nmerited, had he employed his admi\nrable Talents more for the Benefit\nof Mankind?\nThe Egyptians had much the same\nPrinciples as the oriental Nations.\n\u2022 There is nothing more absurd than\nthe Norion generally given us of\ntheir Theology 5 nor is any thing\nmore extravagant than the allegorical\nSense which certain Authors fancy\nthey have discovered in their Hiero-\nglyphicks.\nOn one hand, it is hard to believe\nthat human Nature could ever sink\nso low as to adore Insects, Reptiles,\nand Plants, which they fee produced,\ngrowing, and dying every day, with\nout ascribing certain divine Virtues\nto them, or considering them as Sym\nbols\n\fos the ANTIENTS. n\nbols of some invisible Power. In\nthe most barbarous Countries we still\nfind some Knowledge of a superior\nBeing, which is the Object of the\nHope and Fear of the most stupid\nSavages. But though we should sup\npose there are some Nations in the\nWorld sunk into so gross an Igno\nrance as to have no Notion of a De\nity, yet it is' certain that Egypt can\nnot be charged with this Ignorance.\nAll Historians, as. well sacred as pro\nfane, agree in speaking of this Peo\nple as the wisest of all Nations 5 and\none of the Encomiums that the Holy\nSpirit gives to Moses, is, that he\nwas learned in all the Wisdom os\nthe Egyptians. Would the Holy\nGhost ever have spoken in such a\nmanner of a Nation that was fallen\ninto so senseless and barbarous an\nIgnorance, as to worship Onions,\nCrocodiles, and the most despicable\nReptiles ?\nOn\n\fiz . Os the Theology\nOn the other hand, there are cer\ntain modern Writers who exalt the\nTheology of the Egyptians too high,\nand fancy that they find in their\nHieroglyphicks all the Mysteries of\nthe Christian Religion. After the\nDeluge, Noah doubtless would not\nleave his Children ignorant of the\ngreat Principles of Religion, with re\ngard to the three States of Mankind:\nand that Tradition might have been\nspread from Generation to Genera\ntion over all Nations of the World.\nBut we mould not infer from thence,\nthat the Heathens had as clear No\ntions of the Divine Nature and the\nMejfias, as the Jews had themselves.\nSuch a Supposition, far from doing\nHonour to Holy Writ, would only\nderogate from its Dignity. I shall\nendeavour to keep the just Medium\nbetween these two Extremes.\n2\nPlutarch\n\fos the ANTIENTS. 13\nPlutarch in his Treatise of Isis and\nOJtris, tells us*, ' That the Theo-\n* logy of the Egyptians had two\n4 Meanings 5 the one holy and fym-\n* bolical, the other vulgar and lite*\n1 ral 5 and consequently that the Fi-\n4 gures of Animals which they had\n' in their Temples, and which they\n4 seemed to adore, were only so ma-\n' ny Hieroglyphicks to represent the\n' Divine Attributes.'\nPursuant to this Distinction, he\nsays, that Osiris signifies the active\nPrinciple, or the most holy Beings 5\nI\/is the Wisdom or Rule of his Ope\nration, Orus the first Production of\nhis Power, the Model or Plan by\nwhich he produced every thing, or\nthe Archetype of the World.\nIt would be rash to assert, that\n\u2666Plut. de Isid. & Osir. p. 35-4.\nt Ibid. p. 373, 374, 37s.\nthe\n\f14 Of the Theology\nthe Pagans ever had any Knowledge\nof a Trinity of distinct Persons in\nthe indivisible Unity of the Divine\nNature. But it is plain that the\nChaldeans and Egyptians believed\nthat all the Attributes of the Deity\nmight be reduced to three, Power,\nUnderstanding, and Love. They dis\ntinguished alio three sorts of Worlds,\nthe sensible World, the aerial World,\nand the etherial World. In each of\nthese Worlds they asserted likewise\nthree principal Properties , Figure,\nLights and Motion: Matter, Lorm,\nand ABivity : and on this account\nthe antient Philosophers looked upon\nthe Number three as mysterious.\nif any Man reads with attention\nthe aforementioned Tract of Plu\ntarch, the Works of Jamblichus, and\nwhat Accounts are left of the Reli\ngion of the Orientals and Egyptians,\n\u2022 See Athan.

The\nOrientals and Egyptians had a more\nrefining and metaphysical Genius\nthan the Greeks and Romans, who\nwere fondest of the Sciences that\ndepend on Imagination and Sense.\nThis Key may contribute a great deal\ntowards understanding the antient\nMythologies.\nPlutarch concludes his Treatise of\nI\/is and Osiris in this manner: * 4 As\n4 he that reads the Works of Plato\n' may be said to read Plato, and he\n9 that acts the Comedy of Menander\n4 may be said to act Menander: so\n4 the Antients gave the Name of\n* Gods to the various Productions\n* Pag- 377, & 378.\n4 of\n\fOs the Theology\nof the Deity. (Plutarch had said\na little before,) that care should be\ntaken not to transform, dissolve\nand scatter the Divine Nature into\nRivers, Winds, Vegetables, or\nbodily Forms and Motions. This\nwould be as ridiculous as to ima\ngine, that the Sails, the Cables,\nthe Rigging and the Anchor are the\nPilot 3 or that the Thread, the\nWoof, and the Shittle are the Wea\nver. Such senseless Notions are an\nIndignity to the Heavenly Powers,\nwhom they blaspheme whilst they\ngive the Name of Gods to Beings\nof an insensible, inanimate, and\ncorruptible Nature. Nothing, as\nhe goes on, that is without a Soul,\nnothing that is material and to be\nperceived by our Senses, can be\nGod. Nor yet must we imagine\nthat there are different Gods ac\ncording to the different Countries\nof Greeks and Barbarians, Nor\nthern and Southern People. As\n\fof the ANTIENTS.\n4 the Sun is common to all the World,\n' tho' called by different Names in\n' different Places ; so there is but\n4 one sole supreme Mind or Reason,\n* and one and the same Providence\n* that governs the World, tho' he is\n' worshipped under different Names,\n* and has appointed some inferior\n* Powers for his Ministers\/ Such,\naccording to Plutarch, was the Doc\ntrine of the first Egyptians with re\ngard to the Divine Nature.\nOrigen, wn0 was co-temporary\nwith Plutarch, follows the same Prin\nciples in his Book against Celsus , a\nPagan Philosopher, who pretended to\nunderstand Christianity, because he\nknew some Ceremonies of that Reli\ngion, tho' he never entered into the\nSpirit of it. Now Origen expresses\nhimself in this manner : * ' The\n' Egyptian Philosophers have sublime\n* Orig. contra Cels. lib. i. p. n.\nS 4 No\n\f1 8 Of the Theology\nNotions with regard to the Divine\nNature, which they keep secret, and\nnever discover to the People but\nunder a Veil of Fables and Allego\nries. Celfus is like a Man who has\ntravelled into that Country j and\ntho' he has conversed with none\nbut the ignorant Vulgar, yet\ntakes it into his Head, that he\nunderstands the Egyptian Religion.\nAll the Eastern Nations, (continues\nhe) the Persians, the Indians, the\nSyrians conceal secret Mysteries\nunder their religious Fables. The\nwisse Men of all those Religions see\ninto the Sense and true Meaning of\nthem, whilst the Vulgar go no fur\nther than the exterior Symbol, and\nsee only the Bark that covers\nthem.'\nLet us next hear the Testimony of\nJamblichus, who had studied the Re\nligion of the Egyptians, and under\nstood it thoroughly. He lived in\nthe\n\fof the ANTIENTS.\nthe beginning of the third Century,\nand was a Disciple of the famous\nPorphyry, As both St. Clement *\nand St. Cyril of Alexandria f assure\nus, there were at that time a great\nmany Egyptian Books extant, which\nhave been since lost : Several of these\nwere highly respected for their Anti\nquity, and ascribed to Hermes Trif-\nmegistus, or one of his first Disciples.\nJamblichus had read theseBooks,which\nhad been translated by the Greeks j\nand this is the Account that he gives\nof the Theology which they taught.\n4 According to the Egyptians, the\n' first God existed in his solitary Uni-\n' ty before all Beings^. He is the\n' Fountain and Original of every thing\n4 that either has Understanding or is\n* to be understood. He is the first\n' Principle of all things, Self-suffi-\n* Strom.

He makes\n' nothing superior to this God- Guide,\n' but only the first Intelligent , and\n' first Intelligible , who ought to be\n' adored in Silence\/\nHe adds, * That the Spirit which\nf produceth all things, has different\n4 Names according to its different\n4 Properties and Operations -} that he\n* is called in the Egyptian Language\n4 Amoun, as he is wisse j Ptha, as he\n1 is the Life of all things $ and Off\n\fos the ANTIENTS.\n' r'ts, as he is the Author of all\n* Good\/\nSuch, according to Jamhlichus,\nwas the Doctrine of the Egyptians 3\nand it is evident from thence, that\nthey admitted only one Principle,\nand a middle God, like the Mytbras\nof the Persians.\nThe Notion of a Spirit constitu\nted by the supreme God, to be the\nHead and Guide of all Spirits, is very\nanticnt. The Hebrew Doctors be\nlieved that the Soul of the Messias\nwas created from the Beginning of\nthe World , and appointed to preside\nover all the Orders of Intelligences.\nThis Opinion was founded on a No\ntion , that finite Natures cannot\nincessantly contemplate the Bright\nness and Glories of the Divine Es\nsence, and must necessarily some\ntimes turn off their View, and adore\nthe Creator in his Works , that ac\nS 3 such\n\fOf the Theology \u2022\nsuch Times there must be an Head\nto lead Spirits thro' all the Regions\nof Immensity, and shew them ail its\nBeauties and Wonders.\nTo have a more perfect: Know\nledge of the Theology of the Orien\ntals and Egyptians, it, may not be\nimproper to examine that of the\nGreeks and Romansy which is derived\noriginally from it. The Philoso\nphers of Greece went to study Wis\ndom in Asia and Egypt* Thales^\nPythagoras, Plato, drew the best of\ntheir Knowledge from thence. The\nTraces of the Oriental Tradition are\nnow indeed in a manner worn out ,\nbut as there are leveral Monuments\nof the Theology of the Greeks still\npreserved, we may judge of the Mas\nters by their Disciples.\nWe must however distinguish be\ntween the Gods of the Poets, and\nthose of the Philosophers. Poetry\ndeifies\n\fus the ANTIENTS.\ndeifies all the various Parts of Na\nture, and gives Spirit to Bodies, as\nwell as Body to Spirits : It expresses\nthe Operations and Properties of\nMatter by the Actions and Passions\nof such invisible Powers, as the Pa\ngans supposed to be Directors of\nall the Motions and Events that we\nfee in the Universe. The Poets pals\nin a Moment from Allegory to the\nliteral Sense, and from the literal\nSense to Allegory - from real Gods\nto fabulous Deities : and this occa\nsions that Jumble of their Images,\nthat Absurdity in their Fictions, and\nthat Indecorum in their Expressions,\nwhich are so justly condemned by\nthe Philosophers.\nNotwithstanding this Multiplica\ntion of inferior Deities, these Poets\nhowever acknowledged , that there\nwas but one only supreme God. This\nwill appear from the very antient\nTraditions which we still have left\nS 4 , of\n\fOf the Theology\nof the Philosophy of Orpheus. I am\nvery far from thinking that Orpheus\nwas the Author of those Works which\ngo under his \"Name. I believe with\nthe famous Grottus, that those Books\nwere wrote by the Pythagoreans, who\nprofessed themselves Diiciples of Or\npheus. But whoever is the Author\nof these Writings , 'tis certain that\nthey are older than Hercdotus and\nPlato, and were in great Esteem a-\nmong the Heathens -} so that by the\nFragments of them still preserved,\nwe may form a Judgment of the\nantient Theology os the Greeks.\nI shall begin with the Abridgment\nwhich Timotheus the Cosmographer\ngives us of the Doctrine of Orpheus.\nThis Abridgment is preserved in\nSutdas *.\nf There is one unknown Being\n\u2022 Suidas de Orph. p. 3p.\n* exalted\n\fos the ANTIENTS.\n' exalted above and prior to all Be-\ne ings, the Author of all Things,\nc even of the \u00c6ther, and of every\nc thing that is below the \u00c6ther:\nc This exalted Being is Life, Light,\n4 and Wisdom 5 which three Names\nc express only one and the same\n' Power, which has created all Be-\nc ings, visible and invisible, out of\n' nothing.'\nIt appears by this Passage, that the\nDoctrine of the Creation, that is , of\nthe Production of Substances , was\nnot unknown to the Heathen Philo*\nfophers. We mail soon find it laid\ndown in Plato,\nProclm has transmitted down to\nus this extraordinary Passage of the\nTheology of Orpheus *. c The\n4 Universe was produced by Jupiter,\nc the Empyr\u0153um, the deep Tartarus,\n* Proclus de Tim\u00e6o. p. 95-.\n5 the\n\f16 0\/\/\/^ Theology\n4 the Earth, and the Ocean, the Im-\n* mortal Gods and Goddesses all\n4 that is, all that has been, and all\n4 that Hull be, was contained ori-\n* ginally in the fruitful Bosom of\n' Jupiter.

He is the Life , the Cause,\n4 and the Energy of all Things.\n4 There is but one only Power, one\n4 only God, and one sole universal\n4 King of all.'\nI shall conclude the Theology of\nOrpheus with a famous Passage of\nthe Author of the Argonautica, who\nis looked upon to be a Disciple of\nhis *. 4 We will sing first an Hymn\n4 upon the antient Chaos, how the\n4 Heavens, the Sea, and the Earth\n* Argon- apud Steph. p. 71 .

'Tis clear enough from the Doc\ntrine of the Theogony, or Birth of\nthe Gods, which is the same as the\nCosmogony, or Generation os the\nUniverse, that the antient Poets as\ncribed it entirely to a First Being,\nfrom whom all other Beings derived\ntheirs. The Poem of the Theogonia,\nwhich is ascribed to Hefiod speaks\nof Love \u00a3 as the first Principle which\n4 brought the Chaos into Order 3\nand from that Chaos sprung the\nNight, from the Night the \u00c6ther,\nfrom the \u00c6ther the Light 5 then the\nStars, the Planets, the Earth, and at\nlast the Deities that govern all.\n* \\J\/ 42,5- n\u00a78fl\"j3uT\u00abTov re, itj \u00abutotsA>J 7roAu-\nt Hesiod.

'Twas the Imagination of\nthe Greek Poets that first brought\nforth the monstrous Manich\u00e6an Doc\ntrine about two co-eternal Principles,\na supreme Intelligence and a blind\nMatter, Light and Darkness, an in\ndigested Chaos, and a Deity to range\nit in Order.\nI pass from Hefiod and Ovid to\nspeak of the Theology of Homer\nand his Imitator Virgil. Let any\none read these two Epick Poets with\na proper Attention , and he will fee\nthat the Marvellous which runs\nthro' their Fable is sounded upon\nthese three Principles. 1. That there\nis\n\fOs the Theolog y\nis one supreme God, whom they eve\nry where call the Father, and the\nSovereign Lord of Men and Gods,\nthe Architect of the World, the\nPrince and Governour of the Uni\nverse, the First God, and the Great\nGod. 2.

That Good and Evil, Virtue and\nVice, Knowledge and Error, arise\nfrom the different Influence and In\nspiration of the good and evil Genii,\nwho dwell in the Air, the Sea, the\nEarth, and the Heavens.\nThe Tragick and Lyrick Poets\nexpress themselves after the same\nmanner as the Epick Poets.

They always\ndistinguished between the Under\nstanding or the pure Spirit, and the\nanimal Soul or ethereal Body. They\nconsidered the one as the Source\n\fas the ANTIENTS.\nof our Thoughts, the other as the\nCause of our Motions. They be\nlieved them to be two different Sub\nstances. AnaxagoraS, as we shall\nsoon see, rectified this Mistake,\nThe old Greek Poets had dressed\nup this Opinion in a different Guise;\nthey called the ethereal Body the\nRepresentation, the Image, or the\nShadow because they fancy'd that\nthis subtile Body, when it came down\nfrom Heaven to animate the ter\nrestrial Body, assumed its Form just\nas melted Metal takes that of the\nMold in which it is cast. They said,\nthat after Death, the Spirit still clothed\nwith this subtile Vehicle, flew up to-\nthe Regions of the Moon, where\nthey placed the Ehfian Fields. And\nthere, as they imagined, a sort of\nsecond Death ensued by the Separa\ntion of the pure Spirit from its Ve\nhicle.

He\nheld, that the pure Spirit, and its\nsubtile Vehicle being born together,\nwere inseparable, and returned after\nDeath to the Star from whence they\ndescended.\nI do not speak here of Transmi\ngration, which only related to such\nSouls as were degraded and corrupt\ned in mortal Bodies.

All the Atomists\nwho had laboured in vain to find out\na Demonstration of their false Prin\nciples, presently struck in with the\nPyrrhonian Sect. They ran wildly\ninto the System of an universal Doubt,\n\fOf the Theology\nand carried it almost to such an Ex\ncess of Frenzy, that they doubted of\nthe clearest and most sensible Truths.\nThey maintained without any Alle\ngory, that every thing we see is only\nan Illusion, and that the whole Series\nof Life is but a perpetual Dream of\nwhich those of the Night are only so\nmany Images.\n\/ At last Zenofet up a fourth School\n\/about the 130th Olympiad. This\n\/ Philosopher endeavoured to reconcile\nthe Disciples of Democritus with\nthose of Plato, by maintaining that\nthe first Principle was indeed an infi\nnite Wisdom., but his Essence was on\nly a pure \u00c6ther, or a subtile Light,\nwhich diffus'd it self every where, to\ngive Life, Motion, and Reason to\nall Beings.\nV\nIn these last Ages the modern Free-*\nthinkers have done nothing but re\nvive the antient Errors.

Besides the\nProofs which are drawn from the Ef\nfects, they have insisted on others\ndrawn from the Idea of the first\nCause. They shew plainly that the\n\/ Reasons of believing, are infinitely\nstronger than any Arguments there\nare for doubting. This is all that\ncan be expected in metaphysical Dis\ncussions.\nThe History of former Times is\nlike that of our own.

To\naccount for it, the Philosophers have\nhad recourse to several Hypotheses.\nReason told them all, that what\nis supremely good could never pro\nduce any thing that was wicked or\nmiserable. From hence they conclu-\nY ded\n\fSi. Os the Mythology\nded that Souls are not now what\nthey were at firsts that they are de\ngraded for some Fault committed by\nthem in a former State ,- that this Life\nis a Place of Exile and Expiation j\nand in a Word, that all Beings are to\nbe restored to their proper Order.\nThese philosophical Notions, how\never, had another Original. Tra\ndition struck in with Reason to gain\nthem a Reception, and that Tradi\ntion had spread over all \"Nations cer\ntain Opinions which they held in\ncommon, with regard to the three\nStates of the World, as I shall shew\nin this second Part, which will be a\nsort of Abridgment of the traditio\nnal Doctrine of the Ancients.\nI begin with the Mythology of\nthe Greeks and Romans.

He is always\nsome Son of Jupiter giving Battles\nand gaining Victories.\nI lay no great Stress upon those\npoetical Descriptions, because they\nmay perhaps be looked upon as\nmeer\n\fof the ANTIENTS.\nmeer Fictions, and a Machinery intro\nduced to embellish a Poem and a-\nmuse the Mind. Allegorical Ex\nplications are liable to Uncertainty\nand Mistake. So that I shall pass\ndirectly to represent the Doctrine of\nthe Philosophers, particularly that of\nPlato ,\u2022 who is the Source from whence\nPlotinus, ProclitS, and the Platonijis\nof the third Century drew their prin\ncipal Notions.\nTo begin with the Dialogue of\nPhtfdo, or of Immortality, and give\na short Analysis of it. Ph\u00e6do gives\nbis Friends an Account of the Con\ndition that he saw Socrates in at the\ntime of his Death. \u00a3 He quitted Life,\n(lays he) f with a peaceable Joy, and\n4 a noble Intrepidity\/ His Friends ask\ning him the Reason of it, 4 I hope,\n(says Socrates in his Answer) ' to be\n' re-united to the good and perfect\n* Gods, and to be associated with\nY 3 i bette*\n\f86 0\/ Mythology\nc better Men than those I leave upon\n4 Earth.' *\nWhen Cebes objects to him, that\nthe Soul vanislied after Death, like a\nSmoke, and was entirely annihilated,\nSocrates sets himself to refute that\nOpinion, and endeavours to prove\nthat the Soul had a real Existence \\\nin an happy State, before it inform\ned an human Body.\nThis Doctrine he ascribes to Or\npheus \\. ' The Disciples of Or-\nf phens, (says he) called the Body a\nc Prison, because the Soul is here in\nc a State of Punishment till it has ex-\nc piated the Faults that it committed\n* in Heaven.\n' Souls (continues Plato) that are\n* too much given to bodily Pleasures,\n5 and are in a manner besotted, wan-\n* P. 48. j P. J7. j Plat. Cratyl. p. 276.\n' der\n\fos the ANTIENTS.\n4 der upon the Earth, and are put\n4 into new Bodies. * For all Sen-\n4 suality and Passion bind the Soul\n* more closely to Bodies, make\n4 her fancy that she is of the same\n4 Nature, and render her in a manner\n* corporeal. So that she contracts\n* an Incapacity of flying away into\n4 another Life, and being oppresied\n4 with the Weight of her Impurity\n4 and Corruption, sinks deeper into\n' Matter, and becomes thereby dis-\n* abled to re-mount towards the Re-\n4 gions of Purity, and attain to a\n4 Re-union with her Principle.\nUpon this Foundation is built the\nDoctrine of the Transmigration of\nSouls, which Plato represents in his\nTim\u0153us Locrus as an Allegory, and\nat other times as a real State, where\nSouls that have made themselves un\nworthy of the supreme Beatitude*\n* Pha?d. p. 6i, 62, 63.\nY 4 sojourn\n\fOs the M YTHQLOGY\nsojourn and suffer successively in the\nBodies of different Animals, till they\nare purged at last of their Crimes by\nthe, Pains they undergo. This hath\nmade some Philosophers believe that\nthe Souls of Beasts are degraded Spi\nrits.\n' Pure Souls, adds Plato, that\nc have exerted themselves here be-\nf low to get the better of all Cor-\n4 ruption, and free themselves from\nc the Impurities of their terrestrial\nL Prison, retire after Death into an\n' invisible Place, unknown to us,\nf where the pure unites with the pure,\n' the good cleaves to its like, and\n* pur immortal Essence is united to\n. the divine.\nHe calls this Place the first Earth,\nwhere Souls made their Abode before\ntheir Degradation. c The Earth,\nsays he, ' is immense,- we know and\n* we inhabit only a small Comer of\n3 ' it-\n\fos the ANTIENTS.\nit The ethereal Earth, the an-\ntient Abode of Souls, is placed in\nthe pure Regions of Heaven, where\nthe fixed Stars are seated. We that\nlive in this low Abyss, are apt e-\nnough to fancy that we are in an\nhigh Place, and we call the Air\nthe Heavens ; just like a Man that\nfrom the Bottom of the Sea should\nview the Sun and Stars through\nthe Water, and fancy the Ocean\n: to be the Firmament it self. But\n' if we had Wings to mount on high,\n; we ITiould see that there is the true\n1 Heaven, the true Light, and the\n4 true Earth. As in the Sea every\nf thing is changed, and disfigured by\n\u00a3 the Salts that abound in it j so in\n* our present Earth every thing is de-\n* formed, corrupted, and in a ruin-\n* ous Condition, if compared with\ni the primitive Earth.'\n* P. 8i;\nPlato\n\fOf the Mythology\nPlato gives afterwards a pompous\nDescription of that aethereal Earth, of\nwhich ours is only a shattered Crusts-\nHe says, * that c every thing there\nc was beautiful, harmonious and\n4 transparent; Fruits of an exquisite\n' Taste grew there naturally, and it\n4 was watered with Rivers of Nec-\n' tar. They breathed there the Light\nfc as here we breathe the Air, and\n' they drank Waters that were purer\n' than Air it self\/\nThis Notion of Plato agrees in a\ngreat Measure with that o$Des Car-\nit'5, about the Nature of the Pla\nnets. This modern Philosopher thinks\nthat they were at first Suns, which\ncontracted afterwards a thick and o-\npake Crust 5 but he does not enter in\nto the moral Reasons of this Change,\n\"K Si.\nhis\n\fof the ANTIENTS.\nhis View being only to consider the\nWorld as a natural Philosopher.\ni\nThis same Doctrine of Plato is\nlikewise clearly explained in his Ti-\nm\u0153us *. There he tells us how Solon\nin his Travels discoursed with an E-\ngyptian Priest about the Antiquity os\nthe World, its Origin, and the Re\nvolutions which had happened in it\naccording to the Mythology of the\nGreeks. Upon which the Egyptian\nPriest says to him, c O Solon, you\nc Greeks are always Children, and\n4 you never come to an Age of Ma-\n4 turity : Your Understanding is\nc young, and has no true Knowledge\n* of Antiquity. There have been\n4 several Deluges and Conflagra-\n4 tions upon Earth , cauled by\n* Changes in the Motion of the\n4 heavenly Bodies. Your History\ns of Phaeton , whatever Air it has\n* Tim. p. 1043.\nof\n\fOs the Mythology\nc of a Fable, is nevertheless not with-\n' out a real Foundation. We E-\nc gypttans have preserved the Me-\n' mory of these Facts in our Monu-\n' ments and Temples whereas ic\n* is but a very little while that\nc the Greeks have had any Know-\nc ledge of Letters, of the Muses,\n. and of Sciences.'\nThis Discourse puts Tzm\u0153us upon\nexplaining to Socrates the Origin of\nThings, and the primitive State of\nthe World. c * Whatever has been\n*' produced, says he, has been pro-\n* duced by some Cause. 'Tis no\n' easy Matter to know the Nature of\n\u00a3 this Maker and Father of the Uni-\nf verse j and though you should dis-\n' cover it, it would be impossible\n' for you to make the Vulgar com-\n\\ prehend it.\n* P, 1047,\n< This\n\fes the ANTIENTS. 93\n1 This Architect of the World,\ncontinues he, ' had a Model by\n4 which he produced every thing,\n* and this Model is himself. As he\n* is good, and what is good has\n* not the least TinBure of Envy ,\n4 he made all Things, as far as\n* was possible, like iiimself. He\n* made the World perfect in the\n' whole of its Constitution , perfect\n4 too in all the various Parts that\n* compose it, which were subject nei-\n4 ther to Diseases , nor to Decay of\n< Age\/\nIn the Dialogue which bears the\nTitle of Politkus, Plato mentioning\nthis primitive State of the World,\ncalls it the Reign of Saturn, and de\nscribes it in this Manner. 1 * God\n' was then the Prince and common\n.\n\u2022 P. 1*37, ft*\n? Father\n\fOf the Mythology\n4 Father of all. He governed the\n4 World by himself, as he governs\n\u00a3 it now by inferior Deities. Rage\n4 and Cruelty did not then reign up-\n4 on Earth. War and Sedition were\n4 not so much as known. God him-\n4 self took care of the Sustenance of\n4 Mankind, and was their Guardian\n4 and Shepherd. There were no\n4 Magistrates , nor Civil Polity, as\nc there are now. In those happy Days\n4 Men sprung out of the Bosom of\nc the Earth, which produced them\n* of it self, like Flowers and Trees.\n4 The fertile Fields yielded Fruits and\n4 Corn without the Labour of Til-\n4 lage. Men had no Occasion for\n4 Clothes to cover their Bodies, be-\n4 ing troubled with no Inclemency\n4 of the Seasons 3 and they took\n|4 their Rest upon Beds of Turf of\n4 a perpetual Verdure.\n4 Under the Reign of Jupiter,\n1 the Master of the Universe Saturn^\nt having\n\fof the ANTIENTS.\nhaving quitted as it were the Reins\nof his Empire, hid himself in an\ninaccessible Retreat. The inferior\nGods that governed under him, re\ntired too 3 the very Foundations of\nthe World were shaken by Motions\ncontrary to its Principle and its\nEnd, and it lost its Beauty and its\n4 Lustre. Then the Goods of Na-\n* ture were mixed and blended with\n* Evils. But in the End, lest the\n* World should be plunged in an c-\n* ternal Abyss of Confusion, God,\n4 the Author of the primitive Or-\n6 der, will appear again, and resume\n* the Reins of Empire. Then he\n* will change, amend, embellish and\n' restore the whole Frame of Nature,\n' and put an End to Decay os Age,\n' to Diseases, and Death\/\nIn the Dialogue under the Title\nof Pl\u0153dms, Plato enquires into the\nsecret Causes of moral Evil, which\nbrought\n5\n\fOf the Mythology\nbrought in physical Evil. ' * These'\n' are in every one of us, says he>\n1 two leading and principal Springs\n' of Action, the Desire of Pleasure,\ne and the Love of Virtue, which are\nc the Wings of the Soul. When\nc these Wings are parted , when the\n' Love of Pleasure and the Love of\n' Virtue move contrary Ways, then\nc Souls fall down into mortal Bo-\nc dies\/ Let us fee here his Notion\nof the Pleasures which Spirits taste\nin Heaven, and of the Manner\nhow Souls fell from the happy State\nwhich they enjoy'd there.\nc f The great Jupiter, ( says he )\n' pushing on his wing'd Chariot,\nc marches first, followed by all the\n( inferior Gods and Genii -, thus they\n4 traverse the Heavens, admiring the\n* P. 1216. t P. 12,12.\ni infinite\n\fof the AKTIEN'f S.\ninfinite Wonders thereof. But\nwhen they go to the great Ban\nquet, they raise themselves to the\nTop of Heaven, and mount above\nthe Spheres. None of our Poets\never yet fung, or can sing that Su-\nper-celeflial Place. * There Souls\nwith the Eyes of the Mind, con**\ntemplate the truly existing Essence,\nwhich has neither Colour, nor Fi\ngure, nor is the Object of any\nSense, but is purely intelligible.\nThere they see Virtue, Truth an4\njustice, not as they are here below,\nbut as they exist in him who is the\nBeing it self. There they are de*\nlighted with that Sight till they are\nno longer able to bear the Glory\nof it, and then they return back to\nHeaven, where they feed again on\nNeftar and Ambrosia. Such is the\nLife of the Gods.\n\"tTsfJKgMI Of TSTTOf.\nZ ' Now,,\n\fOf the Mythology\nc Now, continues Plato, * every\n* Soul that follows God faithfully\n* into that super-celestial Place, con-\n' tinues pure and without Blemish 3\n* but if it takes up with NeBar and\nc .

After\nc ten thousand Years Souls will be\n' re-united to their Principle. Dur-\n* ing that space of time their Wings\n* grow again and are renew'd.\nSuch was the Doctrine which Plato\nopposed to the profane Sect of De-\nmocritus and Epicurus, who denied\nan eternal Providence on Account of\nthe physical and moral Evil which\nthey saw in the World. This Phi\nlosopher gives us a fine Description\nof the Universe. He considers it as\nan Immensity filled with free Spirits,\nwhich inhabit and inform innumerable\nWorlds. These Spirits are qualified\nto enjoy a double Felicity 3 the one\nconsisting in the Contemplation of\nthe Divine Essence, the other in ad\nmiring his Works. When Souls no\nlonger make their Felicity consist in the\nKnowledge of Truth, and when lower\nPleasures turn them off from the\nZ 1 Love\n\fOf the Mythology\nLove of the supreme Essence, they\nare thrown down into some Planet,\nthere to undergo expiatory Punish\nments till they are cured by their\nSufferings. These Planets are conse\nquently according to Plato s Notion,\nlike Hospitals or f Places instituted\nfor the Cure of distempered Intelli\ngences. This is the inviolable Law\nestablished * for the Preservation of\nOrder in the Celestial Spheres.\nThis double Employment of Ce\nlestial Spirits, is one of the sublimest\nNotions of Plato, and shews the\nwonderful Depth of his Genius.\nThis was the System adopted by\nthe Heathen Philosophers, when\never they attempted to explain to\nus the Origin of Evil. And thus\nthey reason 5 if Souls could without\nInter-\n\fof the ANTIENTS.\nV\nIntermission contemplate the Divine\nEflence by a direct View, they would\nbe impeccable, the Sight of the su\npreme Good necessarily engaging all\nthe Love of the Will. To explain\ntherefore the Fall of Spirits, they\nwere forced to suppose an Interval,\nwhen the Soul withdraws from the\nDivine Presence, and quits the su\npra-celestial Abode, in order to ad\nmire the Beauties of Nature, and\nentertain itself with Ambrosia, as a\nFood less delicate, and more suitable\nto a finite Being. 'Tis in these In\ntervals that she becomes false to her\nDuty.\nPythagoras had learned the same\nDoctrine among the Egyptians. We\nhave still a very valuable Monument\nof it left in the Commentary of Hie-\nrocles upon the golden Verses ascrib\ned to that Philosopher. ' As our\n4 Distance from God, says this Au\nthor, ' and the Loss of the Wings\nZ 3 ' which\n\f1 03 Os the Mythology\nc which used to raise us up to hea-\n( venly Things, have thrown us\n' down into this Region of Death\n( which is over-run with all manner\n' of Evils 5 so the stripping our\nc selves of earthly Affections f, and\n4 the Revival of Virtues in us make\nf our Wings grow again, and raise\n' us up to the Mansions of Life,\nc where true Good is to be found\n' without any Mixture of Evil.

But Evil comes from a\n* third Principle, neither so perfect\n\u00a3 as God, nor so imperfect as Mac-\n* ter.

I have already {hewn that the\nSchools of Pythagoras and Plato as\nserted Liberty of Will. The former\nexpresses k by the Nature of the\nSoul, which can either raise or sink\nitself j the other by the Wings of the\nSoul, which may move different ways\nand be parted. Plutarch follows\nthe same Principles , and makes Li\nberty consist in the Activity of the\n4 SouU\n\fof the ANTIENTS.\nSoul, by which it is the Source of its\nown Determinations.\nThis Opinion therefore ought not\nto be looked upon as modern. It\nis at once both natural and philoso\nphical. The Soul can always sepa*-\nrate and re- unite, recall and compare\nher Ideas, and on this Activity de\npends her Liberty. We can always\nthink upon other Goods than those\nwe are actually thinking of. We\ncan always suspend bur Consent to\nconsider if the Good that we enjoy,\nbe, or be not the true Good. Our\nLiberty does not consist in willing\nwithout any Reason for willing 3 nor\nin preferring a 1 ester Good to what\nappears to us to be a greater 3 but it\nconsists in examining whether the\npresent Good be a real or an imagi\nnary Good. The Soul exerts its Li\nberty only when it is placed between\ntwo Objects that seem worthy of\nsom$ Choice. It is never carried\nA a ' away\n\fOs the Mythology\naway invincibly by the Impression\nof any finite Good, because it cast\nthink upon other Goods much greater\nthan they, and thereby discover a su\nperior Charm and Attraction that is\nsufficient to get the better of the ap\nparent and deceitful Good.\nIt must be owned that the Passi\nons by the lively Impressions which\nthey make on us, sometimes take up\nall the Capacity of the Soul, and\nhinder it from reflecting. They dar\nken its discerning Faculty, and hurry\nit on to an Assent : They transform\nObjects, and place them in a wrong\nLight. But strong as they are, they\nare never invincible 5 'tis difficult in\ndeed, but not impossible, to sur\nmount them. 'Tis always in our\nPower to diminish their Force gra\ndually, and prevent their Excess.\nThis is the Warfare of Man on\nEarth, and this is the Triumph of\n^Virtue.\n\fof the ANTIENTS.\nr\nThe Heathens feeling this Tyran\nny of the Passions, were convinced\nby the Light of Nature alone, of\nthe Necessity of a celestial Power to\nsubdue them. They always repre\nsent Virtue to us as a Divine Ener\ngy descending from Heaven. They\naxe continually bringing into their\nPoems Guardian Deities that inspire,\nenlighten and strengthen us, to fl?ew\n\u2022that heroick Virtues can only pro\nceed from the Gods. These were\nthe Principles upon which the wisse\nAntients went, in their Arguments\nagainst those Notions of Fatality,\nwhich are alike destructive to Reli\ngion, Morality and Society.

Light, say\n4 they, produced several Beings, all\n' of them spiritual, luminous and\n' powerful. But their Chief, whose\n4 Name was Ahriman or Artmanmsr\n4 had an evil Thought contrary to\n4 the Light. He doubted, and by\n4 that Doubt he became dark. Hence\n4 arose all the Evils, the Dissention,\n4 the Malice, and every thing else\n4 of a contrary Nature to the Light.\n4 These two Principles made War\nf upon one another, till at last Peace\n4 was made, upon Condition that\nc the lower World mould be in sub-\nf jection to Arimanius for seven\n4 Thou\n\ftf the ANTIENTS. \"\nc Thousand Years ; after which space\nc of Time, he is to surrender back\nt the World to the Light.1\nHere we see the soui Notions that\nI speak of in the foregoing Work :\ni.

In the mean time\nhe has allowed me to publish the\nfollowing Passages, which he tran\nslated himself out of some antient\nChinese Books that have been brought\ninto Europe, and which may be seen\nboth at Parts and at Rome ; so that\nall who understand the Language,\nmay judge of the Faithfulness os the\nTranslation.\nThe Book Yking, i. e. the Book\nof Changes, is continually speak\ning of a double Heaven 5 a pri\nmitive Heaven , and a posterior\nHeaven. The first Heaven is there\ndescribed in the following Manner :\n* All Things were then in an happy\n\u00a5 State, every thing was excellent,\nf every\n\fii% Of the Mythology\n1 every thing was good, all Beings\n' were perfect in their kind. In this\n' happy Age Heaven and Earth em-\n4 ployed their Virtues jointly to em-\n' bellim Nature. There was no jar-\n4 ring in the Elements, no Inclemen-\n4 cy in the Air. All Things grew\n4 without Labour, an universal Fer-\n4 tility reigned every where. The\nf active and passive Virtues consph>\n' ed together without any Effort or\n1 Opposition, to produce and perfect\n' the Universe\/\nIn the Books which the Chinese\ncall King or Sacred, we read the sol*\nlowing Passage j ' Whilst the first\n* State of Heaven lasted, a pure\n' Pleasure and a perfect Tranquillity\n\u2022 reigned over all Nature. There\n4 were neither Labour nor Fatigues,\n1 nor Pains, nor Crimes. Nothing\n4 made Opposition to the Will of\nI Man\/\n\fof the ANTIENTS.\nThe Philosophers who stuck to\nthese antient Traditions, and parti\ncularly Tchouangse says, i That in\n* the State of the first Heaven, Man\n4 was united inwardly to the supreme\n' Reason, and outwardly he practi-\n* sed all the Works of Justice. The\n* Heart rejoiced in Truth, and there\n* was no Mixture of Falfhood. Then\n* the four Seasons of the Year fuc-\n* ceeded each other regularly without\n* Confusion. There were no impe-\n* tuous Winds, nor excessive Rains.\n* The Sun and the Moon without\n* ever suffering an Eclipse, furnished\n* a Light purer and brighter than\nat present. The five Planets kept\non their Course without any In\nequality. Nothing did Harm to\nMan, and Man did Harm to no\nthing. An universal Amity and\nHarmony reigned over all Nature.\nBb Oq\n\fOf the Mythology\nOn the other side, the Philoso\npher Hoamantse speaking of the lat*\nter Heaven, says, c The Pillars of\n* Heaven were broken, the Earth\n' was shaken to its very Foundations.\n4 The Heavens funk lower towards\n* the North 5 the Sun, the Moon,\n4 and the Stars, changed their Mo-\nf tions 5 the Earth fell to pieces 3\n\u00a3 the Waters enclosed within its Bo-\nc som, burst forth with Violence,\nc and overflowed it. The Earth re-\n* belling against Heaven, the System\nc os the Universe was cjuite disor-\n' dered, the Sun was eclipsed, the\n* Planets altered their Course, and\n' the universal Harmony was dis-\nc turbed.'\nThe Philosophers Ventse and Li-\netse, who lived long before Hoat-\nnantse, express themselves almost in\nthe same Terms. * The universal\nt Fertility ps Nature, say these an-\ni tieat\n\fos the AftTIENTS. 131\n4 dent Authors, degenerated into an\n4 ugly Barrenness, the Plants faded,\n\u20ac the Trees withered away, Nature\n' desolate and in Mourning, refused\n4 to distribute her usual Bounty. All\n4 Creatures declared War against one\n' another. Evils and Crimes over*\n* flowed the Face of the Earth.'\nAll these Evils arose, says the Book\nLzkiykt, 4 from Man's despising the\n\u00a3 supreme Monarch of the Universe.\n4 He would needs dispute about\n* Truth and Falshood, and these Dis-\n4 putes banished the eternal Reason.\n\u00a3 He then fixed his Looks on terres-\n4 trial Objects, and loved them to\n4 excess. Hence arose the Passions,\n{ and he became gradually transfor-\n4 med into the Objects he loved, and\n* the celestial Reason abandoned him\n4 entirely. This was the original\n4 Source of all Crimes, which drew\n? after them all manner of Evils sent\nBbi , f by\n\fi Of the Mythology\n1 by Heaven for the Punishment?\n4 thereof.'\nThe same Books speak of a time\nwhen every thing is to be restored\nto its first Splendour, by the coming\nof an Hero called Kiuntse, which\nsignifies Shepherd and Prince, to whom\nthey give likewise the Names of The\nmost Holy, the Universal Teacher,\nand the Supreme Truth. He answers\nexactly to the Mythras of the Per\nsians, the Orus of the Egyptians, the\nMercury of the Greeks, and the Bra-\nma of the Indians.\n, The Chinese Books speak likewise\nof the . Sufferings and Conflicts of\nKiuntse, just as the Syrians do of\nthe Death of Adonis, who was to\nrisse again to make Men happy *,\nand as the Greeks do of the Labours\n* See the Description that 'Julius Firmicus gives of\nJ&e Feasts, Ceremonies and Mysteries of Adorns.\nand\n\fof the ANTIENTS.\nand painful Exploits of the Son of\nJupiter who was to come down up\non Earth. It looks as if the Source\nof all these Allegories was only .an\nantient Tradition common to all Na\ntions, that the Middle God, to whom\nthey all give the Name of Soter or\nSaviour, was to put an end to Crimes\nby his great Sufferings. But I do\nnot lay a Stress upon this Notion,\nmy Design being only to speak of\nthe Traces that appear in all Religi\nons of a Nature exalted, fallen, and\nto be repaired again by a Divine\nHero.\nThese Truths run equally through\nout the Mythologies of the Greeks,\nthe Egyptians, the Persians, the In-r\ndians, and the Chinese. 5Tis time\nto come at last to the Jewish My\nthology.\nI mean by it the Rabbinism or\nPhilosophy of the Jewish Doctors,\nB b 3 and\n\fOs the Mythology\nand particularly of the BJsenes.\nThese Philosophers asserted, accord\ning to the Testimony of Pbilo f;\nand Josephus \\, ' That the literal\n' Sense of the sacred Text was only\n* an Image of hidden Truths. They\n' changed the Words and Precepts\n' of Wisdom into Allegories, after\n( the Custom of their Ancestors, who\nc had left them several Books for\n* their Instruction in this Science\/\n'Twas the universal Taste of the\nOrientals to make use of corporeal\nImages to represent the Properties and\nOperations of Spirits.\nThis symbolical Stile seems in a\ngreat Measure authorized by the sa\ncred Writers.

They\nspeak there of the Dew that distilled\nfrom the Brain of the Antient of\nDays, from his Skull, his Hair, his\nForehead, his Eyes, and especially\nfrom his wonderful Jkard.\nThese Comparisons are undoubt\nedly absurd, and unbecoming the\nMajesty os God: But the Cabbalis-\ntical Philosophers pretend to autho\nrize diem by some very metaphy\nsical Notions.\nThe Creation, according to them,\nis a Picture of the Divine Perfecti\nons.

Human Nature is fallen from\nthe first Purity in which it was crea\nted, and this mortal Life is a State\nof Trial, in which Souls are cured\nof their Corruption, and aspire to\nImmortality by their Virtue.\n3. God is united to human Na\nture in order to expiate moral Evil\nby his Sacrifice. The MeJJias will\ncome at last in his Glory to destroy\nphysical Evil, and renew the Face of\nthe Earth.\n4.
