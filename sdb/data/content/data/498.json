The Meeting mil be held on the 22nd February.\nA WELL-EVIDENCED PRECOGNITIVE DREAM\nDr. W. H. C. Tenhaeff, the holder at Utrecht University of the\nfirst academic appointment to be allotted to psychical research, and\nan Hon. Associate of the S.P.R., reports below a case which has\ncome under his own observation. Most of our readers cannot avail\nthemselves of the account in Dutch ^ which was briefly mentioned in\nour \" Notes on Periodicals \" last November ; and besides the evi-\ndential interest of the case Dr Tenhaeff puts forward an interesting\nproblem about the kind of precognition that may be involved.\nIn dreaming of an accident much resembling one which occurred\ntwo days after the dream, is the dreamer to be thought of as making\nuse of her own future knowledge of the event\u2014that is, as anticij^ating\nthe impressions that she herself will later receive on learning of the acci-\ndent\u2014or as making use of some clairvoyant prevision of the scene,\nwhich she did not in fact see when it subsequently occurred ? The acci-\ndent was not fatal in reality, but in the dream it was. Dr Tenliaeff\nand a co-worker of his point out that a confused impression that the\naccident was fatal could well be received by an eye-witness, whereas\nthe published news of the accident did not convey the idea of a fatality.\nThe point cannot be definitely judged in this case, since the\ndreamer first learned of the accident through her husband's verbal\nreport of the news, and we do not know what impression she first\nreceived from his words ; and in any case the dream-mind itself\nmay be looked to as the most likely source of emotional and dramatic\nadditions to the verifiable details in a dream. But it is a point for\nfurther observation, whether evidence for precognition suggests only\na paranormal anticipation of the percipient's oAvn future experience,\nor requires a theory of \" second sight \" by which the percipient\nobserves future event directly as it wll occur.\nThe following is Dr Tenhaeff's report of the case :\nOn 18 November 1937, Mrs 0. of Amsterdam was put in touch\nwith me by a lady whom she had met. Dr J. D., a physician at\nAmsterdam, had also advised her to communicate with me. Mrs 0.\nis a very simple woman (her husband is a house-painter), mother of\nthree children. From what she told me, she was in a nervous con-\n^ Tijdschrijt voor Parapsychologie, x, 4. 161.\n\fJanuary 1939 A Well-Evidenced Precognitive Dream 3\ndition which certain people were inclined to attribute to medium-\nship, developing and not understood.\nMrs 0. seemed very susceptible to hypnosis. I made some simple ex-\nperiments with her, intended as preliminary trials, advised her not to\nhave deaUngs with certain dabblers in parapsychology who appeared\nto be anxious to commiserate with her, and promised that I would\ninvestigate the question of her possessing latent paranormal faculties.\nOn 19 November 1937, Dr J. D. wrote to me as follows :\n\" Mrs 0. \u2014W. has requested me to write to you about her. I lay\nparticular stress on the fact that I am not her family doctor, but\nonly acted as go-between to obtain her admission some months ago\nto a women's clinic, for a shght uterine disorder. She was operated on\nimder h}qDnosis. Meanwhile I found that she had already been under\ntreatment for a long time by a doctor in this place who had regularly\nhypnotised her. Recently she came to me spontaneously for advice\nabout her psychical constitution. She felt, internally, extremely on\nedge and was anxious for some means of self-expression. I had a few\ninterviews \"with her and she proved to be very easily susceptible to\nhypnosis. The only thing I could do was to talk with her and to\nwarn her as to the influence of others. When she asked me what I\nthought about her applying to you I immediately gave my approval.\n... I can't tell anything more about her but I hope that she can get\nfrom you the help which she so ardently desires.\"\nOn Saturday evening, 27 November 1937, I received a letter from\nMrs 0. rujming as foUows :\n\" I intended writing to you yesterday by way of a safety-valve.\nYou will understand this, I expect, for of course I am in a very\ntense condition. But I have had to wait until to-day in order to\nwrite you something else. You had told me that I was to pay\nattention to my dreams. Now I had a dream last night, and every-\nthing was so clear that I have a vivid recollection of it.\"\n(Numbers are inserted iu Mrs O.'s foUowing account of her dream,\nfor future reference.)\n\"I saw a level-crossing (1) and a long road (2) and meadows (3).\nBehind the gate (4) to the left stood a working lorry (5). A car came\ndriving very quickly (6) which was in a hurry to cross (7), but in the\nmiddle a tjTe burst and the car drove full speed into the gate (8)\nand into the lorry (9) which was standing behind. Someone was\nkilled on the spot (10). I saw him lying there, and it was Prince\nBernhard (11). \"VMiat do you think of that? Also deception? I\nhope this letter wiU not be of any value and that it will be indeed\na deception. I write this really for the same reason as that letter to\nthat old lady (12). But as a safety-valve too, for otherwise I walk\nA 2\n\f4 Journal of Society Jot Psychical Research January 1939\nabout all day long with it and see it always before me. Now I sMft\nit on to you. You will certainly be able to deal with it better than I.\nDon't you think it silly that I have written all this to you but I am\nso glad that you will help me. ... I am glad that I have written\nto you, and it makes me somewhat calmer again.\u2014Yours faithfully,\n(Signed) Mrs 0.\"\nThis letter was dated :\n\" Amsterdam, 27 November 1937 \" and it\nappears from the postmark that it was posted in the morning hours\n(probably under the first impression of the dream). I put the letter\naway in my desk. On Monday morning, 29 November 1937, I\nheard, by chance, the wireless report (9.45 a.m.) that Prince Bern-\nhard had met with a motor accident. The letter of Mrs 0., of which\nI had not thought since that evening, was immediately brought out.\nAlthough, happily, we cannot speak here of a prophetic vision\nfulfilled in complete detail, it will be for many an obvious presump-\ntion that we have to deal with a prophetic dream with its details\npartially correct\u2014what is called a Dunne effect.^\nLet us trace exactly, on a basis of the particulars supplied by the\nnewspapers, what Mrs 0. foretold and what occurred in reality.\nThe figures between brackets inserted in Mrs O.'s letter wUl simplify\nthis for us.\n(1) The accident took place in the immediate neighbourhood of\nthe viaduct of the railway-line Hilversum-Amsterdam.\nA photograph reproduced in the paper Het Nieuws van den Dag of\n30 November 1937, shows us (2) a long road with\n(3) Meadows. This is the highroad from Diemen to Amsterdam.\n(4) In the photograph a gate ^ is to be seen.\n(5) In front of this viaduct, work was being done on the railway\nembankment. Sand was being dug, and loaded on to lorries. A\nmoment before the Prince's car passed, a lorry driven by the driver\nD.Z. had descended the improvised starting place. The man in\ncharge of the work, Mr de Baat, was arranging for the lorry to cross\nsafely. He waited a moment for a car coming from Amsterdam\n;\nafter that the lorry crossed the road, turned to the left and was\nstanding so that it faced in the direction of Amsterdam, when the\nright front wing of Prince Bernhard's car collided with the rear\nof the lorry on the left hand side.\n(6) The Prince's two-seater was travelling at a great speed.

There is no level- crossing in the photograph, which shows,\nhowever, a railway bridge crossing the road close to the scene of the accident.\nAnother raQway line rims, unfenced, alongside the road. Ed.\n\fJanuary 1939 A Well-Evidenced Precognitive Dream 5\nmotorist behind liim speaks of 90 km. {Het Nieuws van den Dag,\n30 November 1937.)\n(7) It was not the Prince's car but the lorry that crossed the road.\n(8) There is nothing said of the bursting of a tyre or a collision\nwith a gate.\n(9) As we have seen, the Prince's car did colHde with the lorry.\n(10) Incorrect.\n(11)\n\" Meanwhile, people came rushing from a house in the\nneighbourhood with blankets and mattresses, and the two wounded\nmen were laid on them to await the arrival of the doctors.\" {Het\nNieuws van den Dag.)\n(12) This refers to a spontaneous telepathic experience which she\nsaid she had had in relation with an old lady whom she knew, and\nseemed to perceive lying very ill in bed. She could have obtained\nthis knowledge only in a paranormal manner. I have not been able\nto verify this case, which must have happened a long time ago.\nOn Tuesday, 30 November 1937, I received a letter from Mrs 0.\n(dated 29 November 1937) as follows :\n\" You will have received my letter of Saturday. You can imagine\nmy fright when my husband, coming home at noon, said that Prince\nBernhard had met with a motor accident. I could not believe it at\nfirst and thought he was joking. I had not heard it on the wireless.\nIt had to be that I should not write to you on Friday. I wrote the\nletter on Saturday morning when I was not yet even dressed, I had\nsuch an impulse. You can see now that nearly everything harmon-\nises. That lorry too, and close by it the gate and also close by the\nrailway viaduct. I am quite upset about it and had not thought\nto get a proof so soon of what you had told me. Did not it startle\nyou? Could I speak to you? You understand that I am in great\nneed of it. I had told it on Saturday to my husband and a few\nother people, not thinking that it would be realised so soon. On\nSunday morning I had the same thing constantly in my mind's eye.\nThen I said to my husband :\n'\nHow wretched\u2014I am always seeing\nthat motor accident! '\nI have told it to Dr J. D. He thought it\nvery remarkable. I only hope that the rest will not come true and he\n(i.e. Prince Bernhard) wUl soon be better. But now I see that all\ndreams are not deception. ...\"\nAs I have remarked above, the presumption will be clear to many\nthat we are here concerned with a prophetic dream, partially correct\nin detail, referring to the accident met with by Prince Bernhard on\n29 November 1937. Nevertheless it cannot be said with certainty\nthat we have to do here with a Dunne effect. We must take into\nconsideration the possibility that this is a case of \" second sight \".\n\f6 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1939\nAccording to Dunne it has to be assumed that the subject has an-\nticipated, in a paranormal manner, her own future knowledge of facts.\nThis could only be her future knowledge of the report in the paper,\nand the first report of the accident from her husband (see her letter\nof 29 November), for she was not an eye-witness. Would reading\nabout the accident (and hearing of it) after the event have led to\nsuch an emotional dream? Presumably not. Why then should it\ndo so before the event? My co-operator Mr J. C. M. Kruisinga, who\nhas studied Dunne effects thoroughly, is of the opinion \" that it is\nmore a case of '\nsecond sight ' than a classic Dunne elfect in the\nsense that Dunne conceives. When we read that the subject sees\na tyre burst and says the driver was killed on the spot, we think\nrather of the account of a confused eye-witness than of the account\nof a newspaper reader. Anyone who obtained the news from a paper\nimmediately had the impression that the accident was not fatal. I\nmyself read the report in the Handelshlad and did not get any im-\npression of a fatal accident\u2014it was not until later that we came to the\nconclusion that the driver had escaped death by a miracle. It would\nbe of great importance to know exactly what the subject's husband\ntold her about the accident, when he came home on the Monday.\"\nDuring the months of December, January and February Mrs 0.\ncame to see me repeatedly, and I utilised these visits in trying to\ntrace the subjective factors to which we could attribute her dreaming\nof just this accident. To my regret I have not sufficiently succeeded\nin doing so.\nW. H. C. Tenhaefp.\nMR TYRRELL'S ELECTRICAL APPARATUS\nAt Mr Tyrrell's suggestion, the Research Officer made a careful\ninspection of the apparatus after its re-erection at Mr Tyrrell's new\naddress. It was found to be in perfect working order. It has always\nbeen Mr Tyrrell's practice to make periodic tests of the mechanism\nduring the course of his experiments, and it has now been decided\nthat specific tests of the key relays, the box relays, and the safety\nrelay ^ shall be made as a routine before and after every sitting ;\nalso\nthat each sitting's results shall be recorded on a single length of paper\ntape, at the beginning and end of which will appear the records of the\nroutine tests. In this way, each sitting's record will bear its own\nevidence that the mecham'sm was in proper working order when the\nwork was started, and was still working properly after the sitting was\nfinished. This course has been adopted, not because the apparatus is\n1 See 1936, Proc, Vol. 44, p. 120.\n\fJanuary 1939 Mr. Tyrrell's Electrical Apparatus 7\nlikely to go out of adjustment\u2014it lias been found in the past to be\nvery free from breakdown\u2014but in order that any chance of trouble\nfrom this source may be rendered as remote as possible.\nThe apparatus in its present form is suitable for experiments both\nin pure clairvoyance (i.e. extra-sensory perception in which no other\nincarnate mind than that of the subject is involved) and in mixed\nperception (where a telepathic element may be operating) : also, to\nsome extent, for experiments in precognition. For work in pure\nclairvoyance, numbers selected automatically by an electrical device\nare fed to the apparatus without the operator knowing what these\nnumbers are. This is an improvement over the previous arrange-\nment in which automatically selected numbers, known to the\noperator, were passed into the apparatus through a commutator, the\nsetting of which was unknown to the operator. Here at first sight\nit looked as though telepathic interaction between operator and\nsubject could have no effect upon the results, since the operator,\nthough he knew the numbers, did not know which of his keys was\nconnected to which of the subject's boxes. But for a given setting\nof the commutator, a given key is always associated with the same\nbox ; and so the subject, once she had scored a success with tliat\nbox, could, if she possessed a telepathic faculty, associate that box\nwith the particular key, and could repeat her success whenever that\nkey was depressed. The same would apply to the other keys and\nboxes.^\nIt must not be thought from this that it is in any way considered\nthat telepathy is a faculty which can be taken for granted, or which\nis not worth investigating. Far from it. Though there is probably\na good deal more evidence for telepathy than for the other para-\nnormal faculties which have been postulated, it is always extremely\ndifficult to produce satisfactory experimental evidence for its reality.\nThough many people have no doubt as to the existence of telepathy,\nthe faculty cannot by any means be said to be absolutely proved\nbeyond all question. It is probable that official scientific opinion\n\u2014in so far as there is any official scientific opinion on these matters\n\u2014rejects telepathy. But in any experiments in supernormal per-\nception, it is very important, if possible, to differentiate between\neffects which might be due to telepathy and effects which must be\nlit was this possibility, and this alone, that the Research Officer had in\nmind when discussing the matter with Mr Soal on the occasion referred to\nby him in Light of 1938, June 9, and quoted by Mr Tyrrell in the October\nJournal. It seems possible that Mr Soal may have misunderstood the point,\nas his reference appears to imply that the commutator fails to serve the\npurpose for which it was designed and suggests that it may even be a source\nof information to the subject. This is, emphatically, not the ease.\n\f8 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1939\nindependent of this faculty. And apart from this important\nconsideration, there is another of even greater importance. If the\nsubject in an experiment is in a position to receive relevant informa-\ntion telepathically from the operator, he is also in a position, if\nwithin sight or hearing of the operator, to receive information nor-\nmally by means of sensory cues given unconsciously. In telepathic\nexperiments, therefore, extreme pains have to be taken to guard\nagainst such leakage, not because such leakage is probable, but in\norder to make it impossible, or as nearly so as the technique will\nadmit. Whereas, in non-telepathic experiments, such precautions\nare unnecessary\u2014the operator cannot transmit to the subject\ninformation which he has not got.\nIn its present form, the apparatus should be capable of demon-\nstrating without reasonable doubt the existence of non-telepathic\nextra-sensory perception, or clairvoyance. And also, if operator\nand subject are sufficiently separated to make the giving of uncon-\nscious cues impossible (as can easily be done with the present arrange-\nment) it should be equally capable of use in telepathic tests. The\napparatus should prove a powerful instrument of research, and we\nwish its inventor every success in his difficult work.\nCORRESPONDENCE\nSpontaneous and Experimental Cases\nSir,\u2014I have read with considerable interest Mr Maby's plea that\npsychical researchers should give preference to the study of spontan-\neous cases [Journal October 1938, p. 272].\nA common objection to such cases is that the chances against\ntheir being the products of pure coincidence are often impossible or\nat least extremely laborious to estimate. I admit that this probably\ndoes not apply to certain of the best cases obtained through, say,\nMrs Piper or Mrs Leonard\n\u2014\ni.e., cases in which there is a great\nwealth of verified detail. But it certainly applies to many of the\nsimpler spontaneous experiences. An even more serious objection\nis that in spontaneous cases it frequently happens that many rele-\nvant facts remain unascertainable. One such unsuspected circum-\nstance might, if revealed, change the whole complexion of the case.\nThere is usually a strong element of uncertainty present in cases of\ntelepathic dreams, prevision, etc.\nBut, putting aside this element of uncertainty, I agree with Mr\nMaby that spontaneous cases are often far more illuminating than\nthe results obtained by the use of, say, Zener cards.\nii\n\fJanttaby 1939 Correspondence 9\nUnfortunately it is now clear that orthodox scientists and psycho-\nlogists will pay scarcely any attention to even the most carefully\nrecorded reports of telepathic dreams or experiences with mediums.\nIntrinsically, I suppose, my carefully recorded experiences with Mrs\nBlanche Cooper were of much greater interest than any of the nega-\ntive statistical investigations which I have pubhshed since 1925.\nBut while these experiences were widely discussed in many educated\ncircles I do not think that a single review of them appeared in any\nreputable psychological journal. I fancy that there are still a great\nmany psychologists (as well as other scientists) who consider that\nsitting with spirituahst mediums is scarcely respectable, and to be\ndeprecated. Mediums are still associated in the academic mind\nwith charlatanry and \" baby talk \". However regrettable this\nattitude may be the ordinary scientific worker is bound to be in-\nfluenced by it and he can only devote himself to the kind of studies\nadvocated by Mr Maby under penalty of having his patient work\ncompletely ignored. He will be told that his methods are hopelessly\n\" unscientific \". On the other hand a good many psychologists\u2014in\nthis country at any rate\u2014are becoming more or less favourably\nimpressed by laboratory experiments with Zener cards provided\nsuch experiments are carried out in a rigorously scientific manner.\nSuch experiments are at least free from much of the odium that,\njustly or unjustly, attaches to spirituahsm and researches into the\nproblem of survival.\nThus, while I may be disposed to assent privately to many of Mr\nMaby's contentions, I am compelled as a matter of policy to disagree\nwith him. The vital objective of psychical research at the present\ntime must be to render itself respectable in the eyes of orthodox\nscience. Our paramount object should be to get our studies taken\nup seriously by the Universities, and University psychologists are\nonly impressed by the methods of the laboratory.\u2014Yours faithfully,\nS. G. SOAL.\nMental Automatism and Telepathy\nSir,\u2014One or two points of great significance seem to me to be\nbrought out in Mx Maby's \" Case \", in the October Journal,'^ and they\nare surely worth emphasizing.\n(1)\n\" There was also a sense of shght uncertainty about some, but\nnot all, of the proper names ...\"\nThis surely parallels in an interesting manner the proper-name\ndiSiculty in the cases of mediums.\n1 Vol. XXX, p. 264.\n\f10 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1939\n(2) The point that telepathic rapport seemed to decrease in\nproportion to the lack of personal affection and sympathetic under-\nstanding between agent and percipient throws much light upon the\ndifficulty of obtaining results in experimental thought-transference,\nand why it is that spontaneous cases are so much more striking and\nconvincing, as Mr Maby emphasizes. This is of course generally\nrecognized, but little in the way of verification of the belief has been\nadduced in the past.\n(3) Mr Maby's discussion of the \" core \" of a possible communica-\ntion, giving rise to subliminal \" padding \" by the psychic or medium,\nbut nevertheless instigating it, has many interesting analogies with\ndreams, and was discussed at great length by Hyslop in his Piper\nReport. The old difficulty of sifting the wheat from the chaff is\nhere brought to the fore, showing the error of trying to prove that\nsuch material is either all wheat or all chaff.\u2014Yours, etc.,\nHereward Carrington.\nExperiment in Extra-Sensory Perception\nSir,\u2014From Mr Soal's letters to the Journal, it seems that he makes\na special claim to conduct investigations with every possible scienti-\nfic safeguard. I wonder if this is always so. Early last October I\nwatched Mr Soal testing the card-guessing powers of a subject who\ngives public performances to display faculties of this kind. The\nsubject was given a playing-card, looked at it, and handed it back.\nMr Soal then shuffled it with other cards, under a table, and shd\nthe cards on to the table one by one, face downwards. The table was\nhighly pohshed, and from time to time the colour, at least, of the\ncard could be seen reflected from the surface, before the card was laid\ndown flat. The late Miss Warren and I spoke to Mr Soal of this at\nthe time, and said that we could see enough reflection sometimes to\nbe fairly sure of the card. \u2014Yours, etc.\nM. K. Varvill.\nREVIEW\nThe Riddle of Life. By William McDougall, M.B., F.R.S.\nMethuen. 7s. 6d. net.\nThis little volume, unhappily the last of Professor McDougall's\nworks, poses vividly before the reader's mind the question of whether\nor not experimental science is on its way towards solving the riddle.\nThe authors of the astonishing variety of biological theories reviewed\nin this brief, but admirably clear conspectus, would, no doubt,\n\fJajsttjaey 1939 Review 11\nanswer this question in the affirmative : but, for the most part, their\nconfidence appears to be sustained by their lack of acquaintance\nwith methodology and theory of knowledge, which is no imcommon\nthing with scientific specialists. The doubt rises in the reader's\nmind as to whether many of them see the wood for the trees.\nThe author ranges the theories in order, from tlie sheer mechanism\nof Hogben and Needham to the advanced teleological theories of\nJ. S. Haldane and Whitehead, and subjects the entire series to\nincisive criticism. Though his style is descriptive rather than\npolemical, he indicates his own position with clearness, sapng that\n\" any biology which neglects or ignores the efficacy of psychical\nactivities is doomed to a relative sterility ''.\nOne of the curiosities of contemporary biological theory is its\nreturn to mechanism at a time when mechanics has become an\nanachronism in physical science. This recrudescence of mechanics\nis due to the Mendehan discoveries and the theory of genes, which\nhave revived a belief in mechanical genetics. The brilliant pro-\ntagonists of this latter theory have claimed that it provides a solu-\ntion of the problem of morphogenesis and that it explains that\nmarvellous combination of stabihty with labihty, which is the\noutstanding feature of hving things. But the author traces their\narguments back into the region of the ultra-microscopic and shows\nthat there the causal gap between spatio-temporal arrangements\nof molecules and the ensuing adult dispositions is never bridged.\nThe theory may to some extent describe ; but it does not explarii.\nCuriouslv enough, the most far-sighted of the mechanists, in their\nmore candid moments (notably E. B. WUson), confess to a funda-\nmental ignorance, which their theories do not dispel.\nAfter all we have heard about the importance of genes, it is\nastonishing to read (p. 23) that R. Goldschmidt, a geneticist of the\nhighest authority, has recently pubhshed an article throwing doubt\non the whole of the evidence for their existence!\nThe main crux of biology is, of course, the dispute between\nMechanism and Teleology ; and the author, after passing in review\nthe Organicist, Emergentist and Gestalt theories, considers that\ngroup of theories which centres round the conception of Hohsm, in\nwhich teleological or psychical causation is accepted as a vera causa.\nHere two themes are mtroduced, which are of great importance for\npsychical research, namely the theory of memory and McDougalUs\nmonadic conception of the structure of the organic beiag. Monadism,\nit is argued, is the view to which the dual nature of the organism\npoints ; for organic beings are simultaneously unitary and multiple.\nSometimes, when a part is grafted onto an organism, the grafted part\n\f12 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1939\nsubordinates its growth to the pattern of the whole : but at other\ntimes the graft rebels and follows its own scheme in defiance of the\ntotal pattern. So also in psychology, it is a mistake to regard the\nunity of personality as a primary datum. It is rather \" an achieve-\nment, a product of organic organization, an integration, a har-\nmonization, actively maintained and only too hable to fail and lapse\nin favour of some state of conflict. ...\" In this personal integration\nthe monads are conceived as being arranged in a hierarchy, with the\nself-conscious ego as the dominant member, while communication\nbetween members is telepathic. Should \" telepathic \" sound too\noutrageous a term for the scientific reader, he may say that the\nmonads manifest a direct and \" purely psychical integration \",\nwhich comes to the same thing!\nFinally, the author turns to two outstanding biologies of the\ndualistic type\u2014those of Professors Henri Bergson and Hans\nDriesch. In Matiere et Memoire, Bergson marshalled many facts\npointing to the view that memory is of two kinds, (1) routine mem-\nory, which is really physiologically ingrained habit, and, (2) true\nmemory, or memory oi ftieaning, which exists, he maintains, without\nany material or physical basis. Here is something of central\nbiological importance, since, \" the immaterial basis of memory\nand the reality and the efficacy of the teleological activities of\norganisms are the two main supports of any thorough-going non-\nmechanical biology.\" It must be remembered that the wide\nproblem of instinct is closely allied to that of memory. McDougall\nholds that Bergson's theory of memory contains much that is of\nimportance for psychical research and that it has been unduly\nneglected by workers in that field.\nHe speaks with appreciation of the work of Hans Driesch, pointing\nout that in so far as the latter postulates in the higher organism a\nnumber of co-operating entelechies, his view becomes identical with\nthe monadic theory combined with psycho-physical duahsm.\nWhoever reads with detachment this interesting review of bio-\nlogical theories, so confidently put forward by their various sponsors\nand yet so contradictory of one another, is likely to feel that all\nscientific hypotheses lie shrouded in mist behind those fundamental\nproblems of epistemology, which the human mind has never yet\nsolved.\nG.

Mrs Alfred Lyttelton,\nG.B.E.\nCASE : A COINCIDENCE OF DREAMS\nThe following case has been communicated to the Society by Mon-\nsieur Palthe of Uccle, Belgium, in a letter dated 18 October 1938.\nOn 7 October 1938, Monsieur X ^ attended a reception at the house\nof Madame Y ^ in Brussels. He left at 10.30 p.m. The same night\nMadame Y had the following dream :\n1 The real name.s and addresses are known to the Society.\n\f15\nShe is at the railway station with a gentleman (unknown) ;\nseveral friends see her off including Monsieur X. Suddenly the train\nstarts, and Madame Y leaves without having time to take all her\nluggage. She calls through the open -window to Monsieur X :\n\" Please bring me my luggage, and don't forget the yellow suitcase.\"\nArrived at her destination, she goes up to the luggage depot and\nfinds all her luggage except the yellow suitcase. Monsieur X is\nthere too, and the lady severely rebukes him for his neghgence.\nThe next morning, 8 October 1938, Madame Y related her dream\nto a witness. Monsieur Z ;\n^ and an hour or so afterwards, while\nMonsieur Z was still present. Monsieur X arrived, and before any-\nthing was said to him about Madame Y's dream, he recounted his\nown dream of the previous night, which was as follows :\nHe finds himself at the station, and is in charge of Madame Y's\nluggage. A yellow suitcase is especially recommended to his care.\nHe transports all this with great pains, but the yellow suitcase is\nsomehow lost. He mounts the stairs to the luggage depot, and there\nmeets Madame Y. She gives him a severe scolding for his bad\nbehaviour.\nMadame Y has contributed the following signed statement\n:\nBrussels, 31 October.\nI told Monsieur Z about my dream before hearing Monsieur X's\nstatement, and the latter, in turn, related his dream to Monsieur Z\nbefore hearing my description.\nI have actually a yellow suitcase, but Monsieur X says that if he\never saw it, he never paid to it any special attention. He never\ntravelled with me actually. However, about two weeks before the\noccurrence of the coincident dreams he helped me to transport some\nluggage from one apartment to another. Among this luggage there\nwas no yellow trunk.\nMonsieur X has added a signed endorsement\n:\nI hereby certify that the above letter is a true and correct\nstatement of fact.\nMonsieur Palthe reports that the persons concerned are all trust-\nworthy witnesses.\n\u2022\n1 Monsieur Palthe has interviewed the witness and vouches for the truth of\nhis statement.\n306282\n\f16 Journal of Society for Psychical Research February 1939\nANNUAL REPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR 1938 ,\n(1) Research Department. There has been no lack of material since\nthe pubhcation of the last Annual Report. Thirteen \" spontaneous\n\"\ncases have been examined, of which four have been considered\nsufficiently evidential for printing in the Journal. Two have already\nappeared, and two are in the press. In addition to these, three\ncases of hauntings, and seven poltergeist cases have been investigated.\nNone was worth printing. The records of all these cases are pre-\nserved in the Society's files, and may be seen by Members and\nAssociates on application to the Research Officer.\nA number of minor experiments have been carried out either at\nthe Rooms of the Society, or by correspondence with the persons\nconcerned. Records of these are available for examination. The\nstudy of the paranormal healer, mentioned in the last Annual\nReport, has been continued, but no definite conclusions have yet\nbeen reached. It is hoped that further work on these lines may be\npossible wdtli the collaboration of a member of the medical profession\nwho has lately joined the Society.\nAn investigation has been begun of Mrs Helen Hughes, the well-\nknown platform clairvoyante. Shorthand notes of two complete\ndemonstrations (one a public meeting held at the Caxton Hall, and\nthe other a private meeting at the London Spiritualist Alliance) are\nin the possession of the Society, together with annotations by many\nof the recipients of messages. The Society is greatly indebted to\nthe Council and Secretary of the London Spiritualist Alliance for\ntheir kind co-operation during the course of this work. The in-\nvestigation is being continued, and a report will be issued in due\ncourse.\nAmong other mediums examined is Mr Frank Leah, the artist,\nwho makes sketches of alleged communicators. Several sittings have\nbeen arranged by the Society, the notes of which may be seen on\ndemand.\nThrough the kind offices of Colonel A. H. Bell, the President of the\nSociety of Dowsers, an experiment in map reading was carried out\nwith four members of that Society. The results with one subject\nwere sufficiently striking to warrant further tests being made, and\nit is hoped that these may be arranged shortly.\nIn collaboration with Mr Whately Carington, an experiment in\nconnection with his word-association technique is being conducted\nby the Research Officer. A first series of tests has been completed\nand a second series will be carried out during 1939.\n\fFebruary 1939 Annual Report of the Council for 1938 17\nMany photographs having lately appeared in the press showing\nmediums at seances in a state of apparent levitation, it was con-\nsidered that it would be valuable for the Society to investigate the\nappearance of a person in the act of jumping, photographed with a\nshort exposure. A series of twelve pictures of a jumping model has\nbeen produced, photographed under similar conditions to those which\nwould occur in the seance room, and many of these show practically\nno trace of any movement in the figure. This series suggests that\nit would be easy to give an illusion of levitation by means of a\nsimple jump, if the flashlight apparatus is discharged either by an\naccomplice or by the medium himself. The series of photographs\nis available for comparison with any levitation pictures which may\nbe produced in future.\nDuring the closure of the rooms in the summer, an experiment\nin long distance telepathy was carried out with three percipients,\nall of whom had reason to suppose that they possessed some tele-\npathic faculty. The results were sufficiently promising to justify\nfurther tests.\nAt the request of Dr A. Tanagras, of Athens, a series of tests\nhas been arranged of telepathic transmission between London and\nAthens. A group meets at the Society's rooms every Tuesday\nafternoon, and an attempt is made to transmit images to a similar\ngroup sitting in Athens, and also to receive images transmitted by\nthem. Four sittings have already been held, which have shown\ninteresting results. Further sittings will be held in the new year.\nIn view of the controversy which has arisen over the results of the\nE.S.P. experiments carried out by Professor Rhine and other\nAmerican investigators, the Council decided that it would be very\nvaluable for a series of tests with Zener cards to be carried out by\nthe Society's ofiicers, such tests to avoid as far as possible those\nweaknesses of technique which have been alleged against the Ameri-\ncan procedure. The Society has obtained for this purpose a series\nof cards which has been specially made by Messrs De La Rue.\nAfter a certain amount of experiment, it was found to be quite easy\nto prepare cards which avoided the more obvious defects of legi-\nbility from the back and irregularity of pattern which had l)een\nnoted in the E.S.P. cards previously on sale. The other details of\nthe technique have been worked out with great care, and it is hoped\nthat the Society's present procedure is completely proof against the\nchance of normal leakage, while at the same time allowing the sub-\njects all possible freedom. A few tests have already been carried\nout, and a full programme of work in this field has been arranged\nfor the new year. If any Member or Associate would like to take\n\f18 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Febeuaky 1939\npart in these E.S.P. tests, which include pure telepathy, pure\nclairvoyance and a combination of the two, he should communicate\nwith the Research Oflficer.\nAs a further contribution to the study of Extra Sensory Per-\nception a Committee has been formed, consisting of Professor C. D.\nBroad, Mr Whately Carington, Mr Oliver Gatty and Professor R.\nH. Thouless, all of whom are now resident in Cambridge, with the\nobject of conducting experiments under strict conditions. From the\nwork already done, both within and outside the Society, it is obvious\nthat the study of Extra Sensory Perception is full of technical\ndifficulties and that little progress is hkely to be made unless the\ninvestigators are fully aware of these and will both devise and\nscrupulously maintain the conditions appropriate for dealing with\nthem.\n(2) Presidency. The Council were so fortunate as to secure Lord\nRayleigh's consent to serve as President of the Society for a second\nyear of office. During the year 1938, he contributed to our Proceec^'ijig's\ntwo papers, \" The Question of Lights supposed to have been ob-\nserved near the Poles of a Magnet \", and \" Some Recollections of\nHenry Sidgwick \", in addition to his Presidential Address which\nwas clehvered in 1937.\n(3) Changes on the Council. The Council deeply regret to record\nthe death of Dr Wilham McDougall, F.R.S., which took place in the\nUnited States in November. Dr McDougall joined the Society in\n1902, and a few years later became a member of Council, and Presi-\ndent of the Society in the years 1920-21 . His eminence as a psycholo-\ngist is too well known to call for remark, but it should be noted that\nin his numerous and influential books he more than once put the\nstrongest emphasis on the importance of psychical research, at a\ntime when few psychologists of position showed any interest in the\nsubject.\nThe Council have co-opted Sir Robert Gower, M.P. as a member\nof Council.\n(4) Miss Newton s Betirement. As foreshadowed in the Council's\nlast Annual Report, Miss Newton's retirement from the post of\nSecretary, which she had so long and so successfully filled, took\nplace at Ladyday, 1938. A few days later she read to the Society\na paper entitled \" A Study of certain Leonard Phenomena \" which\nhas been since printed in Proceedings. This was a notable occasion,\nas during the many years that she had been Secretary, Miss Newton's\nmodesty prevented her giving the Society in the form of a paper\n\fFebruary 1939 Annual Report oj the Council for 1938 19\nthe benefit of her great knowledge of all branches of psychical\nresearch.\nThe Council decided that in view of the importance of the research\nside of Miss Newton's work, a Research Secretary should be appointed\nto assist Mr Herbert. After careful consideration they appointed\nMiss V. Warren, the appointment to be considered as provisional\nuntil the end of 1938. Unfortunately, Miss Warren died early in\nNovember.\n(5) The Editorship of the Journal. The Council have appointed\nMr Kenneth Eichmond to act as Editor of the Journal, on Miss Nea\nWalker's resignation which was announced in the last Annual Report.\n(6) Publication of Books relating to the Society's Worl\\ In the last\nReport mention was made of a series of books being prepared by\ndifferent members of the Society, dealing with various asj^ects of the\nSociety's work. Five books in this series have been published, and\nwhile, of course, neither the Council nor the Society take any\nresponsibility for the deductions or theories contained in the books,\nthey consider the objects of the Society will be promoted by making\nreadily accessible to the general public much material contained in\nour Proceedings and Journal ; they have accordingly given the\nauthors permission to quote several cases from the Journal, with\ndue concealment of the names of persons concerned, or with their\npermission, where necessary.\n(7) Special Autumn Lectures. Another way in which the Council\nconsidered that knowledge concerning past work done by the Society\ncould be made available, both to non-members and to members who\nhad recently joined and might not be familiar with it, was by holding\nduring the Autumn two series of Lectures, one in the afternoon and\none in the evening, to which the public were invited on payment.\nUnfortunately, the Lectures had been fixed to take place at a time\nwhen everyone's attention was distracted by international alfairs,\nand the attendance was not as good as had been hoped. There were,\nhowever, interesting discussions after the Lectures which served a\nuseful purpose in putting forward a broader \\'iew of psychical re-\nsearch in relation to its historical background than can be expected\nat most of our meetings which deal with current work in detail.\nThe Council wish to record their thanks to Mrs Varvill for the great\ntrouble she took in helping to organise these Lectures.\n(8) Hon. Members. As a token of their admiration for her work\nas Secretary and her services to psychical research, the Council\nelected Miss Newton an Honorary Member of the Society.\n\fXrH OS o\niH\nI\u2014' 00 o\nf-H ,H 1\u2014\n1\nwl\nto CO CI\nC-3 O rH rH X lO CO CC\no o '\nO O i-H o o\no o oo o o :o oi c;\n, I\u20141 1\u2014\nI\nrH\nCO OJ X o5\n1\u20141\nr-H\nO :D I- ac 1-1\n-f .-( r-1 i!0\nO)\nlO\nCO t-\nso\ntil\n_ CO\nS \u00a3 S\n\u00a311\n15\n^\nV \u201e J i\n^ t 3 i\nt>-\nrH\nOJ\n1\u2014\nI\nX CO\nCO\nOl\n-a o ,\nS 3 i\n1\no COO XOCl O CO O] rH 0\u00bb0 T-t\nr-t\nCO coo -f o \u2014 X O l~ lA\nrH i-H\nCI :D iT. o O :c ?o o CO CO\n|2 O CM OlOO Ci X irs --1 \u00ab*\n-jO OJ Ol I- 1\u20141 1\u2014\n1\niH\nOJ\no o\n- O'\n1-H rH -*\nt+ix\nO O LiO i-O o\nO O O O CM tH\nh iC CD\n?

For\ntwenty-seven years he has been a Corresponding Member of the\nSociety, and now that he is Uving among us the Council considered\nit more proper that he should be elected an Honorary Member.\n(9) Library. During the year 75 Members borrowed 427 books,\nand 89 books were borrowed by the National Central Library.\nSeveral Members availed themselves of the privilege of borrowing\nbooks from other Libraries through the Society and the National\nCentral Library.\n(10) Obituary. In addition to Dr McDougall, the Council regret to\nrecord the deaths of Dr Eugene Osty, a Corresponding Member ;\nalso of Sir Reginald Johnston, Mr J. R. K. Duff and Dr W. H.\nMaxwell Telling.\n(11) Membershij) of the Society During the year 51 new Members\nand 1 Student Associate were elected. The total loss in Members\nfrom deaths, resignations and other causes was 47 Members and 16\nAssociates, leaving a net increase of 5 Members and a decrease of 14\nAssociates. The total membership of the Society now stands at 688.\nThe Council welcome back to membership of the Society several\nmembers who had been compelled to resign in recent years on the\nground of financial stringency. They regard their continued interest\nin the Society's work, evidenced by their resumption of membership,\nas most gratifying.\nThe Council wish that more young men and women would avail\nthemselves of the opportunity of becoming Student-Associates under\nthe scheme, particulars of which were printed in the Journal for\nJuly 1933. They hope that members who come in contact with\nyoung men and women interested, or likely to be interested, in\npsychical research will endeavour to persuade them to join the Society\nunder these conditions.\n(12) Finance of the Society. This is the first full year since the\nSociety obtained exemption from income tax as mentioned in the\nlast Report. Although the rehef so obtained is appreciable, it is\nessential that the strictest watch on expenditure should be main-\ntained and that no opportunity should be lost of increasing the\nSociety's income. The Council wish to draw special attention to the\nseven years' Deed of Covenant recently circulated to all members,\nwith an explanatory statement by the Hon. Treasurer. They hope\nthat every member will respond to the Hon. Treasurer's appeal by\n\f24 Journal of Society foi' Psychical Research Februaey 1939\nexecuting the Deed of Covenant. If this were done, a substantial\nincrease in the Society's income would result.\n(13) Publications. Five Parts of the Proceedings were published\nduring the year : Part 152 in January, Part 153 in February, Part\n154 in June, Part 155 in October and Part 156 in December.\nThe Secretary's sales to the general public amounted to \u00a345 8s. 5d.\nand to members of the Society, \u00a343 5s. 6d. , an increase in both depart-\nments on sales for the past two years. Returns from the Society's\nagent in the United States amounted to \u00a37 Is. 6d.\n(14) Meetings. The following meetings have been held during\nthe year\n:\n26 Jan. \" Two Series of Experiments in Automatic Writing \", by\nCount Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.\n23 Feb. \" Experiments with Mrs Eileen Garrett \", by Mrs Goldney\nand Mr S.

Broad.\nIt may interest readers of the Journal to know that Dr W. B.\nYeats, whose death has lately been announced, always kept his\ninterest in psychical research, though he had not been a member of\nthe S.P.R. since 1929. After reading Mr G. N. M. Tyrrell's book,\nScience and Psychical Research, Dr Yeats expressed a desire to meet\nthe author. Mrs Lyttelton who knew them both invited them down\nto her country home for a week-end. Unfortunately the date\narranged fell in the week of the crisis last September and as the\nhouse was to be filled with hurriedly evacuated children, it was not\npossible for the meeting to take place.\n\fFebeuaey 1939 Correspondence 25\nCORRESPONDENCE\nMr Tyrrell's Electrical Apparatus\nSir.\u2014The important investigation by Mr Tyrrell of Miss\nJohnson's clairvoyant powers deserves the most critical study, since\nit is one of the most successful attempts to devise a method of ex-\n'\nperimenting in E.S.P. which should be proof against error. May I,\ntherefore, without anv unfriendlv intention towards these admirable\nexperiments, play the part of devil's advocate and suggest a possible\ndoubt.\nThe outstanding feature of the results reported in Mr Tyrrell's\nlatest pubUcation (\" The Tyrrell apparatus for testing extra-sensory\nperception \"',\nThe Journal of Parapsychology, II, 1938, pp. 107-118)\nis the fact that his subject fails to score significantly above mean\nchance expectation when the number selector is used but does\nscore significantly when the keys are pressed down in an order de-\ntermined by a series of numbers previously obtained by means of\nthe selector, the possibihty of the subject being influenced by tele-\npath}\" or unconscious whispering being ruled out by the fact that\nbetween each observation the connection between the keys pressed\ndown by the experimenter and the boxes opened by the subject is\naltered in a manner unknown to both experimenter and subject by\nthe action of a rotating commutator.\nThe obvious difference between these two sets of cases is that\nwhen the subject is successful the mechanical selector has not oper-\nated and that when she is unsuccessful it has been used. Mr Tyrrell,\ntherefore, draws the obvious conclusion that it is the use of the\nmechanical selector that causes the failure because the subject has\nacquired a distrust of this piece of mechanism which inhibits success.\nThe sceptical critic may notice, however, that there is another\ndifference between these two series. The commutator was used in\nthe successful series and not in the unsuccessful one. There seems\nto be a possibihty, insufficiently guarded against, that the excess\nof right guesses in the successful series is due to some peculiarity\nof the commutator.\nThere seems to be nothing in the experiments reported that is\ninconsistent with this possibility. On p. 117, Mr Tyrrell mentions\nfive tests of his apparatus in which no significant excess over mean\nchance expectation was obtained. In all of these tests, however, the\ncommutator was kept in a fixed position, so the tests were not carried\nout with the apparatus used exactly as it was used when giving\npositive results with his experimental subject. If it were a defect\n\f26 Jotirnal of Society for Psychical Research February 1939\nof the commutator that was causing the positive results, this would\nnot have been detected by these tests.\nOn p. 116 there is a record of two series of successful results in\nwhich the subject was tested with and without a mechanism for\ndelaying contact until after the choice had been made. Here the\ncommutator was used (as mentioned on p. 114).\nObviously it may be a mere coincidence that, in these experiments,\nsuccesses were scored when the commutator was used but not when\nit was not used, but the matter obviously requires testing. If the\ncommutator were making contacts so that two of the boxes could be\nlighted instead of one in a sufficient number of the observations\n(18% in the last series of trials reported on p. 118) the successes\nwould be explained without any hypothesis of extra-sensory per-\nception. It is true that in his article in Proceedings ('\" Further\nKesearch in Extra-Sensory Perception \", July 1936) Mr Tyrrell\nmentions that the commutator is fitted with a ratchet which pre-\nsumably is intended to prevent double contacts, but it does not\nseem impossible that the ratchet might not be working properly.\nIn any case, whether or not it is likely that the commutator is\nresponsible for the successes, it is obviously desirable that its\nworking should be tested and this does not appear to have been\ndone.\nMay I suggest two further tests. First, the possibility that the\ncommutator was sometimes making connection to two lamps could\nbe very simply tested by having all the boxes open, and making a\nseries of observations with the commutator used between each ob-\nservation, and noticing whether two lights were ever lighted together.\nSecondly, the more general possibility that the commutator was\ninfluencing the results favourably in some manner unknown might\nbe tested by arranging for Miss Johnston to open the boxes in some\nprearranged order (let us say, backwards and forwards from end to\nend), the experimenter's keys being pressed in a random order (as\nin the experiments) and the commutator being used between each\nobservation. If the commutator is not favourably affecting the\nresults, this experiment should give only an insignificant deviation\nfrom mean chance expectation when the number of observations\nwas as large as that in experiments in which Miss Johnson had shown\nsignificant results.\nTo be quite convincing, the second test should be given immediate-\nly after a sitting in which the subject had shown positive results. I\nshould also suggest, as a matter of general principle, that the results\nobtained should be actually published together with the positive\nresults of the experiment itself, i.e. that the figures of the test\n\fFebruary 1939 Correspondence 27\nshould be published and not merely a record of the fact that there\nwas no significant deviation from mean chance expectation. If this\nwere done, and if the results showed a significantly greater excess\nover mean chance expectation for the experimental subject than for\nthe control test, I think it would be difficult for the sceptic to find\nany loop-hole for error in Mr Tyrrell's ingeniously designed experi-\nment. I hope he will find time to do this.\nWhile commenting on Mr Tyrrell's experiments, there is another\npoint that I should like to mention. The statistical propriety of\nMr T^Trell's procedure of not counting results on days on which his\nsubject stated, before the experiment, that she did not think she\nwas going to be successful on those days, has already been discussed\nby Mr Soal and Mr Tyrrell and I have nothing to add to that dis-\ncussion which has been brought to a close. I wish to suggest, how-\never, that there is another reason for regretting that Mr Tyrrell has\nnot recorded results for days when his subject felt that she was\ngoing to be unsuccessful. It has been stated by Dr Rhine, and by\nMr Tyrrell himself, that there are psychological conditions affecting\nsuccess in E.S.P. experiments but these statements rest on impres-\nsions formed by experimenters during the course of E.S.P. experi-\nments and (so far as I know) there is no published quantitative\nevidence on the question. If Mr Tyrrell has that evidence available,\nit seems to me a great pity that he does not pubhsh it. If -Vliss\nJohnson scores significantly lower when she says that she is not\ngoing to be successful, that is a most important fact in the psychology\nof E.S.P. and is also important evidence of her clairvoyant powers.\nIt would seem to eluninate the possibility that I have suggested of\nerror being due to a pecuharity of the commutator, since Miss\nJohnson may be supposed to have knowledge of her own mental\nstates but foresight of the peculiarities of behaviour of a piece of\nmechanism would seem to require clairvoyant powers. On both of\nthe grounds mentioned above, I suggest that it would be of value\nthat the figures obtained on days on which lack of success was\npredicted should be pubhshed.\nThe above letter is written in no spirit of carping criticism of\nMr Tyrrell's experiments. I think it difficult sufficiently to praise\nthe ingenuity of his methods, the careful honesty of his work, and\nthe care with which he has devised new experiments to test suggested\nnormal explanations of his results. It is impossible for an ex-\nperimenter to anticipate all possible future criticisms of his work,\nand an experiment can only become absolutely error-proof if every-\none puts forward all possible objections. If all are tested in turn\nand all are found to be mistaken, the experiment becomes as good\n\f28 Journal of Society for Psychical Research February 1939'\nas possible. It is very likely that my suspicions of the commutator\nwill prove to be unfounded.\nYours faithfully, Robert H. Thouless..\nP.S.\u2014The above was written before I had seen the Research\nOfficer's report on the apparatus. Its statement that the apparatus\nwas in perfect working order may mean that adequate tests of the\ncommutator were carried out. This is not, however, specifically\nstated. If the statement means merely that Mr Tyrrell's previous\ntests were repeated, the commutator remains suspect. In any case,\nwhat is necessary is not to show that the commutator sometimes\nworks satisfactorily but that it is working satisfactorily at the time\nMr Tyrrell's subject gives positive results. I welcome the suggestion\nthat tests should be made before and after each sitting's results, but\nrepeat that such tests would be merely misleading if they were\nsimply those already used. What is necessary is not specific tests\nof separate parts of the apparatus, but a test, such as I have suggest-\ned, in which the apparatus as a whole is used exactly as in the\nexperiment.\nMr Tyrrell writes : The Commutator is in use with the Selector\nas well as with the keys. It is permanently in circuit. The ratchet\ndrive is specially designed to make bridging or \" double contacts\n\"\nimpossible. It is the Post Office engineers, and not I. who are\nresponsible for this switch, which is thoroughly reliable. On more\nthan one occasion every position of the Commutator has been tested\nas Dr Thouless suggests by opening all the boxes.\n9,600 numbers have been taken from the Selector through the\nCommutator for testing purposes, by observing the lamps with all\nboxes open. There has never been a single case of double lighting.\nLet me add that I welcome Dr Thouless's criticisms, but have not\nthe space here to answer them more fully.\nOwing to pressure on space further current correspondence, in-\ncluding a reply by Mr Soal on a point of experimental technique,,\nis held over until the next issue of the Journal.\n\fNo. 553.\u2014Vol. XXXI Maech 1939\nJOURNAL\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research\nNOTICE OF MEETING\nA Private Meeting of the\nSociety\nWILL BE HELD IN\nTHE SOCIETY'S LIBRARY\n31 TAVISTOCK SQUARE, LONDON, W.C. i\nOn WEDNESDAY, 2g March, 1939, at 5.30 p.m.\nWHEN A PAPER ENTITLED\n\"EXPERIMENTS IN AUTOMATIC WRITING\"\nBY\nMiss GERALDINE CUMMINS\nWILL BE READ\nN.B.\n\u2014\nNo Tickets of Admission will be issued for this Meeting.\nMembers and Associates will be admitted on signing their names at\nthe door.

Strutt, R.N., Mrs Gale Thomas and Mr\nG. N. M. Tyrrell ; also Miss M. Candler (Associate) and Mr Kenneth\nRichmond (Hon. Associate).\nThe Hon. Secretary read the Notice convening the Meeting.\nThe Hon. Treasurer, in presenting the accounts for the year,\nreported that the Society had a surplus of about \u00a350 in hand on its\nordinary income and expenditure. The recovery of income tax on\nthe Society's investments, which amounted to about \u00a356 per annum,\nmade a considerable difference to the Society's income. He urged\nmembers to support the Seven Years' Deed of Covenant plan, the\nresponse to which up to date had not come up to his hopes, only\nabout one-third of the members who had been asked to sign the\nDeed having so far done so\u2014but even this would make a difference\nof nearly \u00a3100 a year.\nThe Hon. Secretary said he hoped that members would do their\nutmost to increase the Society's membership. He pointed out that\nalthough the number of members was increasing, the Society was\nnot replacing Associates because they could not afford to do so,\nand consequently the total number of Members and Associates\ntogether was very slightly decreasing. He hoped that more young\nmen and women might be persuaded to join as Student-Associates\nand that members, particularly those in touch with universities and\ncolleges, would help the Society to gain more recruits in this way.\nMrs Goldney made some suggestions for improving the Society's\nfinancial position, which the Hon. Treasurer said he would care-\nfully consider.\nMr Salter moved the adoption of the Balance Sheet and the\nAnnual Report. This resolution was seconded by Mr H. F. Salt-\nmarsh, and carried unanimously.\nThe Chairman announced that there were no candidates for\nelection to membership of the Council, other than the six members\nwho retired by rotation and sought re-election. The following six\nmembers were accordingly unanimously elected : The Rt. Hon.\nThe Earl of Balfour, Sir Ernest Bennett, M.P., Sir Lawrence Jones,\nBart., Sir Ohver Lodge, F.R.S., Mr H. F. Saltmarsh and Mr S.G.Soal.\nMessrs Miall, Savage, Avery & Co. were re-elected Auditors for\nthe forthcoming year.\nThe Hon. Treasurer has pleasure in acknowledging the following\ncontributions to the Society's funds :\nSpecial Donation \u00a31360\n\fMabch 1939 Case 33\nCASE.\nAjst Appaeition of a Dead Person seen in Daylight by Two\nPercipients.\nThe following case was brought to the notice of the Hon. Secretary\nby Mr Arthur Findlay, a former member of the Society, who has\nhimself contributed to the \" Psychic News \" of the 28th January,\n1939, an account of it which is of considerable interest but does not\ngive the percipients' report of the incident in their own words.\nOn the evening of Monday, the 5th December, 1938, a lady,\nMrs X, hving near Great Dunmow, Essex, first shot her husband and\nthen committed suicide by shooting herself. The exact time when\nshe did so is uncertain, but it was clearly estabUshed at the inquest,\nwhich was held on Friday, the 9th December, that it was round\nabout 9 p.m. About 7.45 a.m. the following morning the \" daily\nhelp \" on going to the house found a note in Mrs X's hand-writing,\n\" Don't go in, send for the police.\" Mrs X's body was found lying\nin the garden. The police were called in and sent for a surgeon at\nabout 8.40 a.m.\nThe percipients, Mr and Mrs Dawson, live a mile or two away\nfrom the scene of the tragedy. The following is Mr Dawson's\naccount as given in a letter to the Hon. Secretary on the 17th\nJanuary, 1939\n:\nDear Sir,\u2014In reply to your letter of January 13th, my wife and\nI were motoring to London on December 6th, having left our house\nat 9.15 a.m. and some 5 minutes later we passed Mr and Mrs X's\nhouse, and walking towards us along the country bye-road outside\nthe house was IVIrs X, hatless.\nWe both \" bowed good-morning \" to her, and she acknowledged\nour salutations with a \" bow and smile \".\nWe commented to each other about having seen her and drove on\nwithout further mention of the subject.\nAt about 9 p.m. that night we were told that Mrs X had shot\nMr X and herself at about 9.30 p.m. on the night of December 5th,\nsome twelve hours before we saw Mrs X. We were naturally some-\nwhat surprised at this and assured our informer that we had seen\nMrs X at 9.30 a.m. on December 6th.\nAll times etc. were checked up afterwards.\nIn acknowledging this letter the Hon. Secretary pointed out that\nthe suggestion was sometimes made in coimection with apparitions\nseen out of doors that there had been a mistake in the identity of\n\f34 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1939\nthe person seen and he inquired whether Mr and Mrs Dawson had\nhad a clear enough view to be satisfied that nothing of that kind\ncould have occurred. He also inquired whether Mr or Mrs Dawson\nfirst saw and recognised Mrs X, and whether Mrs Dawson would be\nwilling to confirm the account given in her husband's letter of the\n17th January.\nTo this Mr Dawson replied as follows :\n23. 1. 39.\nDear Sir,\u2014Further to my letter of 17.1.39, I saw Mrs X first ;\nand said \" There is Mrs X \", and my wife must have first seen her\nat almost the identical moment that I did as we were in the front\nseat of the car and it has a very clear view to the front and sides.\nAlso Mrs X was the only person in sight on the road at the time,\n'\nneither did we mistake any one else for her as she happened to be\na very unmistakable woman owing to her style of hairdressing, etc.\nWe passed within say 6 feet of her.\nMrs Dawson wrote at the foot of the letter of the 17tli January,\n\" I concur with the account given in the above letter.\"\nCASE : A DOCTOR'S IMPRESSION SUGGESTING\nDISTANT TELEPATHY FROM A PATIENT\nEarly one mornmg during February 1938 Sir Morton Smart, the\nwell-known physician, while cruising in the West Indies, had a vivid\nimpression of one of his patients, whom we will call Mrs X,^ who\nappeared to be in need of his assistance. Sir Morton mentioned the\nincident to his wife the same day, and a note was made of the date,\nwhich was 1 1 February. On returning home Sir Morton found from\nhis appointments book that Mrs X had called at his house at 12.30\np.m. on 11 February, and had seen a colleague who was attending to\nhis practice during his absence.\nOn 29 March Sir Morton wrote to Mrs X describing the incident\nas follows :\n\" When I was at sea in the West Indies I had a most\ndistinct '\nvision '\nof you and you appeared to be trying to ask me\nsomething! \" ^\nIn answer to a letter from the Research Officer Sir Morton and\nLady Smart suppHed the following signed statements :\nFrom Sir Morton Smart, K.C.V.O., D.S.O., M.D. : With reference\n1 The patient'.? real name is kno^vn to the Society.\n^ A copy of this letter, made from the original by a Member of Council, is in\nthe possession of the Society.\n\fMaech 1939 Case 35\nto your letter of 24 August, I write to confirm the experience I had\nat Sea with regard to []\\Irs X]. I may say, however, that I have had\nmany such experiences of what I call \" seeing things \" during my\nlife, and in consequence I never pay much heed to them beyond\nperhaps making some remark to my wife.\nOn this occasion we were on board ship somewhere in the West\nIndies, when I said to my wife, \" I saw [Mrs X] in my room early\nthis morning\u2014I hope there is nothing wrong \". During the forenoon\nI referred to the matter again as she continually came into my\nthoughts, and I was so impressed that I said to my wife that I must\nremember the date. I did not return till the beginning of March and\nhad quite forgotten the incident until I had been at home for some\ndays. When I remembered it, I asked my butler if there had been\nany message from [Mrs X], and he rephed that she had come hoping\nto see me. I told him to look up the appointment book to see the\ndate, and this proved to be the date I had noted, viz. 11 February.\nThe time she came was 12.30 p.m., which would be equivalent to\nabout 7.30 a.m. on the ship.\nWith regard to the proof of [Mrs X]'s call at this address, the\nDaily List of Patients shows that she had an appointment at 12.30\non 11 February with my colleague, Mr. Tucker, who was doing my\nwork during my absence, and the Ledger also shows that the visit\nwas made.\nAs I say, I have had many similar and even more remarkable\nexperiences ia my life, but I have made a rule that I merely accept\nthem when they happen, and do not wish to make investigations\nabout the why or the wherefore.\n1 see no reason, however, why you should not pubhsh the account,\nsuch as it is, if [Mrs X] has no objection.\n^\nThe date on which I remembered the incident on my return and\nmade inquiries to find out if there had been any message from [Mrs.\nX] was the date on which I wrote to [Mrs X] telling her of my\nexperience.^\n(Signed) Morton Smart.\n21 Grosvenor Square, W. 1.\n31 August 1938.\nFrom Lady Smart.\nWhile on board ship in February 1938, my husband told me one\nmorning that he had seen [Mrs X] in his room, and he felt so sure\n^ Mrs X has kindly consented to an account being printed, but prefers that\nher real name shall not appear.\n2 i.e., 29 March.\n\f36 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1939\nthat there was something wrong that a note was made of the date,\n11 February.\nSome time after our return, my husband told me that [Mrs X]\nhad wished to see him and had actually called on the same\ndate.\n(Signed) Lilian Morton Smart.\n31 August 1938.\nIn response to a further letter from the Research Officer, Sir\nMorton Smart very kindly verified from the Shipping Company the\nexact position of the ship at the time of his impression : she was\nalongside the wharf at Cura9ao, and her clocks were set to local\nstandard time. Inquiry from the Royal Geographical Society has\nelicited that the standard time of Curagao is 4 hrs. 36 m. slow on\nG.M.T. 12.30 p.m. in London would thus coincide with 7.54 a.m.\nin the ship.\nThe following questions were addressed to Mrs X, whose signed\nreplies are given in square brackets :\n(1) When had you (approximately) last seen Sir Morton?\n[Probably in the early spring of 1937].\nWhen you called at his house on 1 1 February did you know that\nhe was away or did you expect to find him?\n[I expected to see him].\n(3) Were you in the habit of visiting Sir Morton regularly?\n[No, irregularly].\nMrs X was also asked if she could remember at what time she\nformed the intention of visiting Sir Morton, but she was not able to\ngive any information on this point.\nIt is difficult to resist the conclusion that Sir Morton Smart's\nimpression was a supernormal cognition either of Mrs X's arrival at\nhis house (possibly conditioned by her disappointment at finding\nhim away), or of the state of mind which prompted her visit to his\nconsulting room. It is unfortunate that we have not an accurate\nrecord of the exact time of the impression, but it must clearly have\nbeen near enough to 12.30 p.m. G.M.T. to make an explanation by\nchance coincidence exceedingly improbable. If the visit and the\nimpression are causally connected, the only alternative to a super-\nnormal explanation seems to be that Sir Morton had an unconscious\nexpectation that Mrs X would be likely to visit him at about this\ntime, and that the expectation became dramatized in the form of the\nimpression. If Mrs X had been in the habit of consulting Sir Morton\nat regular intervals, such an explanation might not be too remote ;\nbut she has stated that she is not a regular visitor, and gives the\n\fMarch 1939 Correspondence 37\nearly spring of the previous year as the probable date of her last\nvisit.\nThe thanks of the Society are due to Sir Morton Smart for his kind\nco-operation in working out the case, and to Mrs X for her permission\nto print : also to Lady Smart for her statement, and to the Secretary\nof the Royal Geographical Society for verifying the time relation\nbetween Curagao and London.\nCORRESPONDENCE\nExperiment in Extra-Sensory Perception\nSir,\u2014I am afraid that your correspondent Mrs Varvill is under a\ncomplete misapprehension with regard to the objects and scope of\nour present experiments with \" Marion \". We are not reporting\non any playing card experiments in which the back of the card is\nvisible to Marion. At this late stage of the investigation we have\nnot the slightest interest in testing whether Marion can identify a\ncard when it is mixed with five others and the cards are placed in\nfront of him backs uppermost on the table. That question was\nsettled in the affirmative once and for all in 1934.\nIn the experiments conducted during that year there was no\npossibihty of Marion seeing the reflection of the cards in the surface\nof the table. Indeed he was in a large number of tests sent out of the\nroom while the six cards were spread out face downwards on the\ntable and afterwards he was not allowed to lift any card but merely\nto touch them with his finger tips. In other tests the fights were\nturned out and the light-proof shutter drawn and Marion was\nallowed to touch the card only in the dark. The cards were spread\nout on the table in the dark in certain cases.\nWe also made numerous tests with both playing cards and stiff\nmillboard cards which proved fairly conclusively that Marion is\nable to identify a card by touch alone.\nOn the particular afternoon, 5 October 1938, when Mrs Varvill\nwas present, the sole object was to discover whether Marion would\nbe able to identify a card which he had previously held, and which\nhad been mixed with five others, while he was wearing a black\nfight-proof hood. I had carefully tested this hood which could be\ntightened up with strings at the collar and beyond question Marion\ncould see nothing with it over his head. In 1934 Marion was allowed\nto hold the card to be identified in the dark and there was the\ndisadvantage that we were not able to watch his movements in\nthe dark. The hood allowed us to note all his manipulations.\n\f38 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1939\nAs he was in total darkness reflections on the table were of no\nconsequence and the cards were lifted off the table for him to hold\none by one. Ten experiments of this sort were done and though\nMarion was not very successful on this particular afternoon, which\nwas the first for this series, he succeeded admirably when wearing\nthe hood in the succeeding weeks. Now there is no question that\nMarion can recognise cards by touch alone although it requires a great\ndeal of fingering on his part.\nIt is true that on the afternoon of 5 October we did a few pre-\nliminary trials in which Marion was allowed to see the cards spread\nout before him face downwards on the table. But these were\nmerely to give him confidence before starting on the real work of\nthe afternoon. In these few trials we were not trying to discover\nanything ;\nthey were not serious experiments. Quite possibly\nMarion could catch a glimpse of a card reflected on the table but\nthis does not matter since he was also able to identify the card\nquite easily from specks on the back or from the sUght bend he\ngave it while holding it. I could have picked the card out every\ntime without much difficulty. So probably could Mrs Varvill.\nThis elementary test has been repeated ad nauseam and there is\nno point at all in taking any elaborate precautions over it at the\npresent stage. But the experiments with the hood had to do with\nthe far more difficult feat of tactual recognition and these experi-\nments have been carried out with the greatest care. It is always\nour practice before trying a new experiment with Marion to allow\nhim to succeed at something that is very easy and obvious so as to\ncreate confidence for the coming test. On the same principle I\nalways allow him to finish up with a few trials in which it is fairly\neasy for him to succeed. This creates a good impression.\nBefore Mrs Varvill made the totally irrelevant criticism which\nshe has made she should have read carefully my previous report\non Marion and made herself familiar with what has already been\nproved. At least she might have taken the trouble to ask what we\nwere trying to discover on that particular afternoon.\nYours faithfully,\nS. G. SOAL.\nMektal Automatism and Telepathy ; Spontaneous and\nExperimental Cases\nSir,\u2014I am much obliged to Mr Hereward Carrington and Mr Soal\nfor their comments in the Journal on my recent paper on a case of\n\fMarch 1939 Correspondence 39\nmental automatism and apjDarent telepathy. (See S.P.R. Journal\nOctober 1938, pp. 264-74 andJanuary 1939, pp. 8-10.)\nThe difficulty commonly experienced by automatists and mediums\nover proper names is, as Mr Carrington says, an interesting point.\nFor it is noteworthy that in cases of old age and partial loss of\nmemory proper names are first to lapse, though powers of ideation\nand sound reasoning may remain. The same thing happens when\none is unwell or over-fatigued. In fact, in \" dissociated \"\nstates\ngenerally the psychic entity in charge of the organism tends to lose\ncontrol of that part of the mental machinery that deals in proper\nnames and other \"hard facts\". Such states may prevent the\nsubject from recollecting the names of even his or her loved ones,\nowing to failure or inhibition of the appropriate (? cerebral)\nmechanism, while retaining the ability to think and speak of them.\nJudgmg by my own mental state when ill or fatigued, also from\nstatements made to me by senile and partly deranged persons with\nwhom I have had sympathetic conversations on their cases, I am\nsatisfied that the failure of such subjects to recollect proper names\nor recent events, or even to express themselves coherently, in no way\nnecessarily implies senility, insanity or breakdown in the ultimate\npsychic personality. The breakdown appears, rather, to be in the\nphysiological component of being. If, then, a similar diagnosis\nmay be made with respect to mediums and automatists, not to\nmention normal subjects when dreaming, it would be as unreason-\nable to blame them for certain shortcomings of memory, etc., as\nto blame a musician for being unable to give an orthodox perform-\nance on a broken or faulty instrument. His failure would not\nnecessarily denote ineptitude or fraudulence.\nAgain, the state of affairs obtaining in trance, dream and dis-\nsociated or automatic states of mind often seems to resemble what\nhappens when one rotates the tuning knob of a radio receiver so\nas to obtain a succession of brief and conflicting excerpts from\nvarious broadcast programmes. What one hears is not by any means\nnonsensical : it only seems nonsensical to the listener\nWith regard to Mr Soal's remarks, may I say that, thouah I\nappreciate his point, I am unconvinced of the wisdom of his decision\nHowever desirable it may be to isolate a single factor, for reasons\not simplicity or mathematical analysis, and to produce simple\nextra-sensory phenomena to order in the laboratory, I doubt that\nthe first aim can ever be accomplished, whereas the second is by no\nmeans easy, as Mr Soal has good cause to know. On the other hand,\nit IS a fact that spontaneous cases present a much greater wealth of\nmaterial for investigation, and they also seem desirable in view of\n\f40 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1939\nthe naturalness and unforced nature of their occurrence, as com-\npared with the cramping and, perhaps, distorting artificiahty of\ntests done to order. For hke reason I would be the last to recom-\nmend the phenomena of the average spiritistic seance for serious\nscientific study, since anticipation and autosuggestion generally\nproduce unsatisfactory conditions for accurate observation. But\nthe core of evidence here, again, seems to most patient observers to\nbe genuine enough.\nAs for the opinions of the outside scientific world, we should\nnot let them worry us seriously, provided only that we are sure that\nwe are practising good science and logic\u2014which the S.P.R. has\nalways been careful to do. The acceptance of new ideas and dis-\ncoveries has always been a tardy affair so far as the orthodox die-\nhards of any school have been concerned. But it might be well\nfor psychical researchers generally, and some in particular, to spend\nless time over the ever recurrent questions of chance-coincidence,\nantecedent improbability, fraud and collusion, and to devote more\ntime to an unprejudiced and subtle analysis of the many spontane-\nous cases that are available. Many excellent and informative cases\nare at present dismissed with a wave of the hand as being incon-\nclusive. But do such conclusions represent a profound and im-\npartial analysis? Very seldom, one fears. And even though coinci-\ndence, hallucination, obsession, autosuggestion or telepathy, should\nenter into such cases, does that invalidate their claim to serious\nconsideration? Surely not! Individually, almost all such cases\nhave their merits either psychological, parapsychological or spiritis-\ntic ; and collectively, when properly categoried, their evidential\nvalue is impressive. But other scientists will not, for the most\npart, be likely to pay much attention to parapsychologists so long\nas prominent investigators among the latter continue to spend much\nof their energy at attempting to invahdate even so well attested\nand, it seems, widespread a phenomenon as telepathy.\nLast, to return to the question of laboratory experiments as\nagainst analysis of more complex spontaneous cases. I maintain\nthat it is an axiom of all biological investigation, as distinct from\nsome forms of physical, chemical and mathematical enquiry, that (1)\nthe whole is more important than, or at least differs from, its parts ;\nand (2) that, so far as possible, no organism or organic process\nshould be dissociated from its natural environment if its nature\nand behaviour are to be properly apprehended. To dissect is to\ndestroy ; so that dissection, though permissible, within limits, in\npurely anatomical, mechanistic and physio-chemical studies, is\nusually imsound in regard to vitalistic behaviour or psychological\n\fMarch 1939 Review 41\nprocesses. I am afraid that such a statement will not be welcome\nto Mr Soal as a mathematician, whose instinctive aim is, natvirally,\nto reduce such phenomena to numbers or symbolic equations, any\nmore than it is to some physiologists and experimental psycho-\nlogists. But, after all, such things were not primarily invented\nto please statisticians ; and arguments such as that so many\nrashers of bacon of different shapes and grades go to make up\none pig have very little bearing upon the life and being, sentiments\nand emotions of a living porker. Nor can the most detailed examina-\ntion of one tissue or organ give us any true conception of the whole\norganism : the well-recorded spontaneous case in Psychical Re-\nsearch being an analogous organic whole, as contrasted to the too\ndelimited and artificially isolated laboratory experiment in tele-\npathy or clairvoyance. And even in so far as the latter partially\nrepresent the natural phenomena, they do so no more completely\nthan do the sparks from an electric induction coil, say, represent\nthe complex reahty of what we call a thunderstorm. So that, if\na physicist desires to understand an electric storm he will not\ncontent himself simply with the observation of small sparks generated\nin the laboratory, though that may be a useful subsidiary experi-\nment respecting the principles of electricity. And even the manner\nof production of the given event {e.g. an electric spark or a tele-\npathic impulse) may be very different in the two instances ; so\nthat it is not safe to argue from one to the other.\nYours truly,\nJ. Cecil Maby.\nREVIEWS\nForeknowledge. By H. F. Saltmarsh. Bell (\" Psychical Experi-\nences \" Series). 3s. 6d. net.\nIt was to be expected that Mr Saltmarsh would bring to the writing\nof this book not only his usual clarity, but the skill that comes of\nspecial study. The value of his work on the subject of precognition\nis well known to members of the Society, who will appreciate his\nexpert handling of the cases which are here collected, and the simple\nand economical discussion that he provides on points of theory.\nEven within the hmits of a small book, the review of evidence is\nimpressive, and the examples that are quoted, from S.P.R. and other\ntrustworthy records, need a multitude of stretched hypotheses if they\nare to be explained away. One recorded, admits of an all too\n\f42 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1939\nnormal explanation : the bishop's wife who dreamed of a pig in a\nparticular place in the dining-room {Proc. XI. 487). After telling\nthe dream to her children, and, in the bishop's absence, reading\nfamily prayers, she went into the dining-room and found the pig duly\npresent. Could a sportive child have escaped family prayers and\nbrought about the fulfilment? The hypothesis fits child-psychology\nbetter than pig-psychology\u2014there are considerable chances against\na pig's acquiescence in being hurriedly directed into a dining-room ;\nand its being in the right place in the room to suit the dream would be\ndifficult to account for, unless this were chance, or unless the memory\nof the dream adjusted itself to suit this detail. But normal explana-\ntion does seem possible here, and could be turned to illogical account\nfor the discrediting of other cases\u2014illogical, because most of the\ncases admit of no normal explanation except deliberate and collusive\nuntruthfulness on the part of responsible witnesses.\nOn the theoretical side, Mr Saltmarsh makes a witty and salutary\nremark on the actuality of Time :\n\" if time be not a reahty . . . what-\never it is, which we normally take for time, is so good an imitation\nthat it does just as well for all practical purposes as real time, if\nthere be such a thing as real time.\" In fact, all argument about time\ntends to be circular, because the mind is chasing a mental concept\nwhich is, as it were, tied to its own tail. Mr Saltmarsh, like Professor\nBroad, does not care for J. W. Dunne's escape from the circle into\nthe \" infinite regress \" of serialism, and he puts aside the Dunne\ntheory on grounds which are more a statement of objection than of\nreason for objection ; but he makes the very pertinent remark that\nchange, rather than time, is our real observational starting-point.\nTime is so familiar an idea that we think we know what we mean by\nit when we do not.\nThe same thing is true of memory\u2014and precognition looks hke\n\" remembering forwards \", with the difference that the event seen\nahead is subject to intervention in the mean time, as in the case in\nthis book where a yachtsman dreams of his boat being swamped on a\nsandbank after the breaking of mooring ropes, and is able to avert\nthe catastrophe by waking and going on deck just before the ropes\npart {Proc. XIII, 401). Cases of this kind dispose of the naive idea\nthat precognition implies a fated future ; it does not involve fatalism,\nbut what it does involve as to the nature of time and of human con-\nsciousness is a question as obscure as it is interesting. Mr Saltmarsh\ndoes much to lighten the obscurity, not by minimising our present\nignorance but by making sure that while we are necessarily ignorant\nwe are not also confused.\nK. R.\n\fMaech 1939 Reviews 43\nTrance. Wanderungen im Grenzgebiete des Seelenlebens. Von Hugo\nKramer. Verlag : R. Lechner (Wilh. Miiller). Wien I, 1936.\nThis book of 300 pages makes, I confess, a somewhat strange\nimpression. The author, Herr Kramer, is, we are told on the title-\npage. President of an Association for the scientific {naturwissenschaft-\nliche) investigation of the soul, and his book purports to give de-\ntailed accounts of twenty-two seances with Frau Kramer as medium.\nAt the beginning of each seance Herr Kramer puts his wife into\ntrance, and she then discourses at great length (also answering\nquestions) on such subjects as the Past and the Future, Radiations,\n\" Spheres \", Dreams, the Consciousness (at four sittings), Nerves,\nthe Nature of the Soul, Reincarnation, etc. The reports are not\nclaimed to be verbatim (though notes appear to have been taken\nduring the seances ; see photograph on pp. 260-261), and the\ncritic is therefore entitled to ask himself whether Herr Kramer's\nbook does reproduce quite exactly everything that was said. Judg-\ning by a \" Preliminary Remark \" on p. 17, Herr Kramer would\nperhaps resent such enquiries : criticisms already expressed with\nregard to the records before the book was printed are in this\nVorhemerkung summarily dismissed, and in a somewhat off-hand\nmanner.\nThe lack of certainty as to the complete accuracy of the pubhshed\nrecords is the more to be regretted as some (by no means all) of\nthe knowledge displayed by the medium on some of the points\nraised and discussed (on the structure of the brain for instance in\nthe fifteenth seance and on the nerves in the fourteenth) seems at\nfirst sight remarkable, the more so as Frau Kramer was being\ninterrogated by Dr R., a physician and a speciahst.\nOn the other hand it is obvious that the possibility of acquiring\nsome knowledge on these matters in a normal way before the sitting\nwas by no means always excluded, seeing that the subject to be\ndiscussed next time was often decided upon at the end of a seance.\nIt should be added that the confidence of the sitters (only their\ninitials are given) m the medium appears to have been boundless.\nIt is much to be regretted from my standpoint that so much time\nwas given to lengthy disquisitions almost de omni re scihili et\nquibusdam aliis and that so Uttle effort was made to test Frau\nKramer's supernormal powers (if any) in a more modest but also\nmore convincing manner. Frau Kramer asserts that she is able\nwhen in trance to review in a moment the whole of the Universe\n(p. 245). If so, how easy it ought to be for her to give adequate proof\nof the concrete reality of her faculties in a humble but tangible way!\nIt is true that, so she tells us, she feels irritated when questions are\n\f44 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1939\nput to her in order to test lier (p. 26, cf. also pp. 65-67). Such bemg\nunfortunately the case, the sitters had to content themselves with\nvery few tioiid endeavours which do not appear to me altogether\nsatisfactory. At the tenth seance the medium proposed to name\ncolours after merely touching various objects with her fingers. She\ntried twice and succeeded each time\u2014but no mention appears of\nher eyes having been bandaged ;\nthey were closed as usual, and\nthat was apparently thought sufficient! Dr R. was nevertheless\nenthusiastic about this \" experiment \"\n(p. 261).\nIn view of such an attitude on the part of Herr Kjramer's circle,\nit is difficult to attach much significance even to such apparently\nsupernormal incidents as may have been both authentic and con-\nclusive. One such incident I find on p. 239, where Frau Kramer is\nstated to have reproduced the last words of a dying person (unknown\nto her). Its possible importance I do not wish to minimise, but\nI feel bound to say frankly that the general atmosphere of the\nseances, the enthusiasm of the sitters and the above-mentioned lack\nof certainty as to the absolute exactness of the records do not tend\nto enhance the evidential importance of this episode.\nThe last four seances dealt with Reincarnation and here we find\nthe medium giving us particularly amazing accounts and proffering\nparticularly stupendous claims, such as that she is able in the trance\nstate to follow events in the past existence of another person's\nsoul \" for thousands of years back \"\n(p. 286).\nI regret to say that in my opinion such preposterous statements\nare rather derogatory to a medium's reputation. Qui veut trop\nprouver ne prouve rien. The faculties claimed by Herr Kramer's\nmedium are by no means proved by what is related in the book, and\nwhat is worse, the very fact that they are claimed casts an unfavour-\nable light on other \" manifestations \"\n\u2014perhaps unjustly. But the\nfault hes not with the critic.\nPerovsky-PetroVO-SOLOvovo\n.\nE. S.P. PICTURE TEST\nAn experiment in the extra-sensory perception of distant pictures\nwill begin next month.

But before\nwe reach such a conclusion, full account should be taken of certain\nknown tendencies of the dream-mind in the direction of con-\nstructing situations that meet the hopes and wishes of the dreamer.\nThe case is an interesting one for discussion from this point of view,\nand it should be added that the care and completeness with which\nthe details have been recorded give every help in the reconstruction\nof a clear psychological picture.\nThe case will first be set out, below, as recorded by our con-\ntributor, and then briefly discussed so as to raise the question how\nfar a psychological explanation may be adequate.\nStatement of Congressman A\nAs a Representative in Congress I had had two secretaries in my\nemploy for about frve years. During the last week in March and the\nfirst week in April 1936, the selection of a successor to one of them\nwho was contemplating resigning to accept another position was\nunder consideration by my two secretaries and myself. It was of\npersonal poUtical importance to me that no one except ourselves\nshould know that I had a sucessor to select. This was necessary in\norder to avoid a rush for the position, accentuated by the depression,\nwhich would make a desirable selection difficult. Accordingly the\nmatter was kept in the utmost secrecy by the three of us, working\nat our offices in Washington. 150 miles away from my home town of\nX, where Mr K, the reporter of the incident following, also had his\n\f48 Journal of Societij for Psychical Researcli April 193&\nhome. I had been much away from home during the last 25 years\nand did not know Mr K, who is about half my age and who was\nraised in this town during my considerable absence. I had, however,\nknown his father from casual meetings at the Post Office, where the\nfather was employed.\nDuring the first week in April, my secretaries and myself deter-\nmined that the elder of my secretaries, Mr C, should go up into the\nDistrict to find the right person as a new additional secretary. The\nonly conditions imposed were that the selection should be a man and\na stenographer and should preferably come from my home town, X.\nMr C made the trip to X under instructions to keep the position to be\nfilled 23erfectly secret until the selection was made, and advises\nme that he did so. Mr C will add to this preface a statement as to\nhis own actions on reaching X. May I add my assurances that there\ncan be no doulit that normal information had not reached Mr K\nthat there would be a secretarial vacancy in my office at the time of\nhis dream. I could not then have had him in mind, since I did not\nknow even of his existence, a statement which I am sure is equally\ntrue of Mr C and of the resigning secretary. Mr K advises me that\nexcept as presented in the dream he had not been thinking of being a\nsecretary in Washington.\nSometime after Mr K had reported for work Secretary C told\nme of Mr K's telling him of the dream he had on 1 April, and shortly\nthereafter Mr K at my request detailed the dream to me. I then\nasked him to write up a narrative of the dream and the circum-\nstances, which he did within some weeks of the happening. May I\nsay that Mr K, whom I now know very well, is no dreamer of dreams,\nis not a spiritualist, nor was he deeply interested at the time of his\ndream in psychic subjects. He is, however, a very thoughtful man,\nalways cautious in any statement he may make.\nNov. 19, 1938.\nStateiKoit by Mr K\nThe following dream was experienced by me in the town of X,\nduring the night of 1 April, 1936.\nThe dream-scene opens in an office in Y, a small town near X.\nI was seated at the left of Congressman A. who was seated at a desk\nin a relaxed position. My dream status was that of secretary to\nCongressman A, and we were talking. I was asking his advice as to\nthe advisability of studying law. From his remarks, I seemed to\ngather the impression that he thought it was rather late in life for me\nto start. We continued to talk for some time and then left the office\n\fApril 1939 Case 49\ntogether and walked toward X, our home city. Along the way\nCongressman A was pointing out places of interest and remarking\nhow they had changed since he was a young man. I seemed to be\nrather inattentive, being still absorbed with the previous conversa-\ntion. As we reached the bridge crossing over the river to our home\ntown, the dream ended. The manner and characteristics displayed\nby Congressman A in the dream are almost identical with those I\nhave come to learn since my association with him. I was not\npersonally acquainted with him at the time of the dream. I had,\nhowever, met him some 14 years before and had seen him on a\nnumber of occasions since. No recollection is had of any other\ndreaming this night, either before or after the dream referred to.\nThe dream struck me as being particularly strange, and in the\nmorning I related it to my brother, and several days later to a friend\nand liis wife.\nBackground\nAt the time of the dream I was not secretary to Mr A, nor liad I\never had any thought of it. I was working in a business owned by\nMr B, with whom I had been associated for 14 years and had acted\nas his secretary. These men had been friends for many years, but\nabout the time I first became associated with Mr B, they became\nestranged as a result of a political difference and had never become\nreconciled.\nShortly after the beginning of my association with Mr B (14 years\nbefore the dream experience) he declared his candidacy for the\nUnited States Senate. His son advised me at the time that in the\nevent of Mr B's election, I would go to Washington as his secretary.\nMr B, however, withdrew his candidacy a few months later, and\ncontinued on in the business to which I have referred.\nDuring the latter several years of my association with Mr B, he\nhad an office in Y (the town figuring in the dream). This office was\nlocated on the opposite side of the street from the one indicated in the\ndream. However, the tyjie of furniture and arrangement was entirely\ndifferent from that seen in the dream.\nActual Happening\nAbout a week after the occurrence of the dream, on the night of\n7 April, 1936, I received a telephone call from the friend to whom I\nhad mentioned the dream. He stated that he had just been informed\nthat a party had come from Washington for the purpose of inter-\nviewing prospects for a position in Washington, D.C., and he had\nbeen asked by his informant to suggest available prospects. With\n\f50 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1939\nthe exception of the quaUfications required and compensation, he\nhad no other information concerning the position. For some months\nI had been considering a change of employment, because of the only\npartial activity of the business with which I was connected, so I\nadvised my friend that I would think the proposition over and let\nhim know within an hour, as he was to report back to his informant.\nDuring the conversation, the thought came to me that it might\npossibly be a secretarial position with Congressman A. I cannot say\nwhether this thought was j)rompted by the dream or whether it was\nsuggested from the quahfications required and the location of the\nposition. I talked the matter over with my brother and again men-\ntioned my thought as to the position. I called my friend and told\nhim that I would be interested and would come to see him at his\noffice the following day so that contact could be made with the\nperson who was to conduct the interview.\nOn calling at the office of my friend the next day, he advised me\nthat he had just learned that the party who was to interview me was\nMr C, a secretary to Congressman A. The interview was had later\nthe same day, and while no information was given by Mr C as to the\nexact position, I seemed to know that it was to be associated with\nCongressman A. Finally, Mr C stated that he would accept my\napplication, and could tell me at that time that I would work with\nhim, and that I was to report to Congressman A's ofl&ce the following\nSunday. I went to Washington and to the office of Congressman A\nand was then informed by Mr C that I was to be a secretary to\nCongressman A.\n[Mr K's statement that he told the dream to three witnesses is\ncorroborated by signed statements from the three people concerned,\nwho attest the accuracy of Mr K's report in this respect. That is,\nMr K's brother confirms that he was told of the dream the morning\nafter it occurred, the other two witnesses that they were told of it\n\" several days later \". These two witnesses, a husband and wife,\nwere told at the same time, and the husband mentions in his state-\nment that this was before Mr K's employment by Congressman A.]\nStatement by Mr C\nFor the past eight years I have been employed on the secretarial\nstaff of Congressman A.\nOn 6 April, 1936, it became definitely known there would be a\nvacancy in the secretarial staff, due to the resignation of a member\nof the staff to accept an appointment elsewhere with the Govern-\nment. This vacancy was known to but three persons, Congressman\n\fApeil 1939 Case 51\nA, myself and one other. A conference was held between us three\non 6 April, 1936, and it was decided that I make a trip through the\nCongressional District to select a suitable person to fill the vacancy.\nMr A suggested that I go first to X, his home town, and try there\nfirst, then if not successful to go into other counties of the District.\nI left for X late in the afternoon of 6 April, arriving in X late in\nthe evening. The following morning, 7 April, I contacted a certain\njudge and told him Mr A would have an appointment to fill in\nWashington, D.C., but did not tell him anything about where the\nposition was located. I asked him if he could suggest a suitable\nperson who would qualify as to the requirements I named. He said\nhe would like time to look around and that I should see him the\nfollowing morning. I saw the judge on Wednesday morning,\n8 April, 1936, when he told me he knew of but one person and that\nhe would hke me to see this man. He told me his name was K and\nhe arranged that I meet Mr K in the Post Ofiice building in X.\nMr K was not located in that ofiice, so the judge called the deputy\nrevenue collector and asked him to call Mr K to come to his ofiice\nfor the conference.\nI met Mr K and talked with him privately, going over with him\nhis qualifications. I asked Mr K to prepare a written statement of\nhis background, experience and qualifications, and said that I would\ncall to see him that afternoon. I gave no indication whatsoever\nas to where the possible vacancy existed ;\nhowever, when Mr K had\nfurnished me his written statement, I told him to report to Mr A's\nofiice in Washington, D.C., suggesting that he come down on Sunday,\n12 April, 1936, and then I told him the position was on the secretarial\nstaff of Congressman A. Mr K entered the employ of Congressman\nA on 13 April, 1936, and has continued in his employ to this date.\nNov. 21. 1938.\nLet us now consider the psychological situation out of which the\ndream may be held to have arisen. It is well defined in Mr K's notes\nfollowing his account of the dream. He is secretary to Mr B, and is\nwishing for other employment because business is slow. It seems\nprobable that his subhminal consciousness could entertain some\nsuch reflections as these :\n\" I wish I had a more active job with Mr B. If only Mr B had\npersisted in his candidacy for the Senate he might have got in, and\nI should now be his secretary at Washington. Mr B's former friend.\nCongressman A, went through with his candidacy, and has left this\ntown and gone to Washington. I wish I had been in Mr A's employ.\"\nThis would have been very possible as o day-dream in Mr K's\n\f52 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Apeil 1939\nmind, and if some such reverie had emerged in his waking thoughts\nthe idea would have been the less hkely to emerge in a night-dream.\nHis evidence is that he had no waking thought of being secretary to\nCongressman A. It is, of course, pure conjecture that he had,\nsubhminally, any such train of thought : but it is clear from the\nfacts that this would be a natural and possible course for his sublim-\ninal thoughts and wishes to take.\nThis being so, it would be most natural that his dream should\nrepresent him as employed by Mr A instead of Mr B, in an office\nresembling one of Mx B's but with a difference (on the other side of\nthe street, and with different furniture). The dream would then\ncombine past and present, as dreams often do : the wish to have been\nassociated with Mr A's career and the wish to he qualified for work\nwith Mr A in the present. The dreamer's problem about \" studying\nlaw \" will bear this interpretation, since law is the business of a\nlegislator, and the question arises in the dream whether it is now\n\" rather late in life\n\"\"\nfor him to acquire the new qualification. This\nwould be a natural touch of anxiety in the mind of a man who felt\nthat he had been stagnating for some time in his present job.\nThe fact that the Mr A of the dream speaks of changes in the\nneighbourhood since he was a young man also points to the view\nthat the dream is combining ideas of the past and of the present.\nIf some such psychological jjrocess as we have sketched could\naccount for the formation of the dream, giving it the character of a\nwish-fulfilment rather than a precognition, we have to depend on\nchance-coincidence to explain how Mr K\"s dream-wish came to be in\naccordance with the facts\u2014that a vacancy was about to occur on\nthe staff of Congressman A, and that the steps to be taken in order\nto fill this vacancy would lead to inquiries in the town of X and\nto the selection of Mr K as a suitable man for the post. And a fairly\nimprobable chance-coincidence has to be assumed, because the dream\noccurred only five days before Mr A's move to secure a new secre-\ntary, and six days before Mr K first heard of the opportunity ;\nwhereas there would appear to have been a long, though indefinite,\nperiod of time during which Mr K's wish for other employment\nmight have found expression in a dream. Also, the fact that Mr K\nwas sufficiently impressed by his dream to describe it to others on\ntwo occasions is evidence that he felt it to be significant.\nThe case is interesting as an example of the kind for which possible\npsychological explanations need to be taken into account ; but it\ncan be held that some element of precognition needs to be assumed\nto account fully for what occurred. Or, for those who prefer hypo-\ntheses of telepathy, it can be supposed that the fact of the coming\n\fApkil 1939 Case 53\nvacancy on Congressman A's staff, which, Mr C records, \" became\ndefinitely known on 6 April, five days after the dream, was suffi-\nciently known to those concerned, at the time of the dream, for a\nfreakish telepathic effect to have occurred. It will be remembered\nthat at the beginning of the first statement printed above, from\nCongressman A, he notes that '\"\nduring the last week in March\n\"\n{i.e. before Mr K's dream) the idea of appointing a new secretary\n-was already being considered.\nCASE : A VERIDICAL IMPRESSION OF NON-\nEXISTENT WORDS IN A LETTER\nThe following case has been contributed by Sir Lawrence Jones,\na friend of the percipient, Mrs Moor, wife of the Rev. C. Moor, D.D.\njNIrs Moor's account of her experience is printed below, followed by\nstatements from the four persons mentioned in the account.\nEarly in January I was staying with my sister. The day before\nI left I had a letter from my daughter R in which I read, \" Nanny\nis in bed with bronchitis.\" I read it out to my sister.\nI wrote to my daughter V to teU her.\nWhen I got home next day my first question was How's Nanny?\"\nR. She's all right I suppose.\n\/. But you said she was in bed with bronchitis.\nR. No. I never said such a thing.\nNext morning I went to see how things were and found N just out\nof bed and very sadly indeed, having had bronchitis.\nI. Miss R told me you had had bronchitis.\nN. Miss R! but she didn't know ; I wouldn't tell her to trouble\nher.\nGetting home I looked again at the letter. I knew exactly the\nplace on the page where I'd seen Nanny is in bed with bronchitis \"\n;\nit wasn't there or anywhere else in the letter, nor was there room in it\nfor a single extra line. Nanny had been greatly longing to see me to\npour all out but wouldn't write as I was on a holiday.\nConstance M. Moor,\n8 March, 1939.\nOn 4 January, 1939, I received a letter from my mother saying :\nPoor Naimie has got bronchitis.\"\nVeronica Moor,\n12 March, 1939.\n\f54 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1939'\n12 March.\nThe first week in Jan. I liad an attack of Bronchitis. I did not telL\nMiss Moor nor write to Mrs Moor though I was longing to see Her.\nHannah Cox.\nWhen my Mother got home early in Jan. I was surprised by her\nfirst question \" And how is Nanny ?\n\" still more so to be told I had\nwritten that Nanny was in bed with bronchitis, since I knew nothing\nabout it. My mother was apparently prepared to go at once and see\nthe invalid which I assured her was quite unnecessary. I told her\nthat Nanny had sent me a line a day or so earlier saying that she\nwould not be coming to us as usual on Sunday as she was going to a\nfriend : therefore she could not be ill. So my Mother gave up\ngoing.\nI was aware that she did not really believe I had not written about\nit, and next morning. she went round early to find Nanny in bed with\nbronchitis and rampant to see her. She had been in bed some days.\nRosalie Moor,\n15 March, 1939.\n27 March, 1939.\nFrom Dowager Countess Ferrers.\nMy sister, Mrs Moor, was staying with me in January this year.\nOn January 3 the day before she left me she said that she had had\na letter from her daughter that morning saying that their old\nservant, Hannah Cox, was in bed with bronchitis.\nM. Jane Ferrers.\nCORRESPONDENCE\nSpontaneous and Experimental Cases\nSir,\u2014After reading Mr Maby's views on the relative values of\nspontaneous and experimental cases I have little to add to the plea\nwhich I put forward in the January Journal for exact experiment in\npsychical research.\nI can only regret that Mr Maby does not share my opinions. May\nI bring to his notice an admirable article by Professor Fliigel which\nappeared in John 0' London's Weekly for 24 February in which the\nauthor\u2014himself an eminent psychologist\u2014sums up the reasons for\nthe scepticism with which orthodox science and psychology regard\nthe so-called \" proofs \" of telepathy and clairvoyance? Professor\nFliigel shows very clearly that such scepticism is not due to mere\n\fApril 1939 Correspondence 55\nconservatism or antipathy to what is new and revokitionary ; a\ndeeper cause is to be sought in the baffling and elusive nature of the\nalleged phenomena themselves. One investigator finds abundant\nevidence for E.S.P. by allowing a mere handful of people to guess at\nthe figures on cards while other experimenters, at least equally\ncareful, examine larger numbers of subjects without finding any\nevidence at all. Or again a subject produces phenomenal results\nwith certain investigators in America but this same subject when\nexamined by ten persons in England displays no abnormal powers\nof any kind. I ask what reaction can the orthodox psychologist\nshow to all this? At the worst he will be frankly sceptical and at the\nbest non-committal. It would seem therefore that little advance\nwill be made until we have discovered the definite conditions,\npsychological and physiological, which favour the emergence of\nE.S.P. And such conditions can only be found, if at all, by controlled\nexperiments in the laboratory. We might go on observing and\nrecording spontaneous cases of psychical phenomena for hundreds\nof years and at the end be not a whit nearer to any experimental\ncontrol or any real knowledge of their nature. Whatever may be the\nultimate verdict of posterity on the reality of Dr Rhine's claims\nI think he and his disciples are on the right track and nothing that\nMr Maby has said or can say will alter my opinion on this fundamental\nissue.\nThere is one statement in Mr Maby's letter which I should\nlike to question. On p. 40 at the end of the second para-\ngraph he writes '\"\nBut other scientists will not for the most part\nbe likely to pay much attention to parapsychologists so long as\nprominent investigators among the latter continue to spend much of\ntheir energy at attempting to invalidate even so well attested and\nit seems widespread a phenomenon as telepathy \".\nSurely Mr Maby is not here suggesting that we should cease to\ninvestigate experimental telepathy by scientific methods for fear\nthat our results should be negative and that negative results are\nprejudicial to psychical research? Such a suggestion would be\nunworthy of any scientific man though I can easily imagine that it\nwould carry weight with the large and motley following whose\nwhole interest in the subject is emotional and centred round the\nproblem of their personal survival. Let me say at once that as a\nscientific man I have not the slightest sympathy with such senti-\nments. Science is interested in the truth however bleak that may\nbe and not in wish-fulfilments. If modern psychologists thought\nthat telepathy was as widespread and well-attested as Mr Maby\nimagines they would be studying it every day in their laboratories,\n\f.56 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1939\n])ut obviously with few exceptions they are ignoring it altogether.\nIf Mr Maby wishes to know the reasons for this neglect he cannot do\nbetter than consult Professor Fliigel's article mentioned above.\nI cannot suppose that Mr Maby seriously believes that persons\nlike Professor Adams, Professor Thouless and myself are conducting\nnegative investigations in an attempt to \" invalidate \" or disprove\ntelepathy. I personally would travel a hundred miles to witness a\nconclusive case of experimental telepathy. But so long as my own\nresults continue to be negative I shall go on trying to find every flaw\nI possibly can in the work of those who make positive claims. In\nfact the more intelligent criticism we have in this obscure field the\nbetter for all concerned.\nIf telepathy and clairvoyance cannot be produced under labora-\ntory conditions and in the presence of competent unbiassed observers\nI predict that official science will continue to ignore them. This\nmay be a matter of indifference to Mr Maby, but to many of us who\nare serious investigators it is not. For some of us are no longer\ncontent to watch psychical research go jogging along in the same old\nbad unscientific way, its devotees collecting obscure coincidences\noften without even troubling to discover how far such coincidences\nwould apply to other sets of people and circumstances and deliber-\nately ignoring the methods which the calculus of probabilities has\nput into our hands.\nYours faithfully,\nS. G. SOAL.\n(This discussion is now closed. The conclusion emerges that\npsychical research progresses upon two feet and that neither is in\nneed of amputation. Ed.)\nREVIEWS\nDrei Vortrdge iiber Philosophie und Parapsychologie. By Johannes\nT. PooRTMAN. Leiden, 1939.\nThis publication comprises three lectures. In the first of these,\nthe author critically examines certain points in the philosophy of\nKant and brings it into relation with other doctrines, in particular\nthe \" psychical monism \" of Heymanns and Polak. The concepts\nof ' a priori \" and of the \" epistemological subject \" form the centre\nof the discussion. The terms \" infrasubject \" and \" suprasubject\n\"\nare introduced : the first of them is empirical and personal ; the\n\fApril 1939 Reviews 57\nsecond means something suprapersonal, it is a metaphysical hypo-\nthesis and equivalent to Kant's '\"\nBewusstsein uberhaupt \". This\nlecture has no direct connexion with psychical research.\nThe second lecture is devoted to the relations between para-\npsychology and philosophy, philosophy being defined as the\n\" independent systematisation (unabhangige Zusammenfassung) of\nall sciences \". Philosophy should never be allowed to neglect\nfacts : unexplained facts are yet facts.\" Aesthetic or emotional\nconsiderations never justify a philosophical system though they\nmay be of importance for a man's general regard for the universe,\nbut \" Weltanschauung \" is not the same as scientific philosophy.\nThe concepts of \"a priori \", induction \" and \" deduction are\nshortly discussed.\nParapsychology claims to be a science and must, therefore, rest\nupon scientific methods. It stands in a mutual relation to philosophy;\nit receives and it gives.\nIt receives from general philosophy its method, induction in par-\nticular. A theory must never be the starting-point, though it may\ntake a concluding place. Neglect of this axiom was the mistake of\nthe ' enlightenment \" (x4ufklarung) of the eighteenth century,\nthough this had its merits in abolishing many forms of superstition.\nOn the other hand, it is never permissible to say a priori that any-\nthing in the sphere of the empirical world is impossible \". The\nterm occultism \"',\nit is remarked, ought to give place to the much\nbetter term \" parapsychology \".\nIn exchange, parapsychology has to give a good many things to\ngeneral philosophy : it shows that materialism is a wrong theory\nand that \" psychophysical parallelism \" is at least a very improbable,\nif not even an impossible, hypothesis. The author deals briefly with\nthe relation of parapsychology to vitalism, but. I think, no vitalist\nwould agree with his conception of this biological doctrine. Scientific\nvitalists have never maintained that organic phenomena are in-\nexjilicable by natural causation, nor presupposed a \" mystical\ninfluence \" ; according to scientific vitalism organic phenomena are\nsubject to natural law as much as are inorganic phenomena, though\nthe form of this law is different in the two spheres of nature.\nIt is not permissible to build a \" Weltanschauung \" upon para-\npsychology, but hypotheses of all kinds are allowable if they are\nconsidered only as hypotheses. This is also the proper attitude for\nspiritualism.\nThe third lecture attempts to assemble points that can be related\nto parapsychology from the realm of general literature. There are a\ngood many of them in the works of various authors. But, as works\n\f58 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1939\nof art are the product of creative phantasy, they do not in them-\nselves tell us anything about the personal convictions of their\nauthors. The literary artist lends his imagination equally to ideas\ndrawn from mythology and mysticism. The only thing we can\naffirm is that these authors have had some acquaintance with the\nevidence for paranormal events.\nHans Driesch.\nLes Metapsychoses. La metapsychorragie, la telepathie, la hantise.\nBy Dr P. Thomas Bret. 1\"' volume : Introduction, et La\nMetapsychorragie Fantasmale. (Paris : Librairie J. B.\nBailliere et fils.)\nThe chief value\u2014to me at least\u2014of this book of Dr Bret's (already\nthe author of a Precis de Metapsychique in several volumes) is that it\nreminds us once more, and in a rather striking way, of the in-\nexhaustible supjily of episodes and incidents\u2014mostly spontaneous\n\u2014apparently implying a \" supernormal \" origin and explanation,\nwhich have been recorded by painstaking investigators in the course\nof, let us say, the last fifty or sixty years.\nAll the facts quoted by the author of Phanlasmal Metapsychorragy\nhave already (I believe) been published at one time or another.\nNevertheless their reappearance in print is welcome at a time when\nthe supply of new spontaneous observations and experiences appears\nto be on the decrease.\nDr Bret will, however, forgive my adding that not a few of the\nincidents which lie recalls are evidentially on a low level, and that\nsome are distinctly suspicious. I even observe the names of some\nwitnesses whose evidence would not go far, I am afraid, to establish\nthe reality of any phenomena. This does not detract from the vahie\nof many other cases, though some may think that it must qualify\nour opinion of the author as a critic.\nThe volume is of 312 pages and deals with apparitions in general,\nand apparitions of the so-called \" double \" in particular. The ter-\nminology used by the writer is bewildering. Why coin new, quasi-\nscientific terms from the Greek for things that can quite well be\ndescribed in existing terms? The effect is particularly painful when\nthey are applied to phenomena of very doubtful authenticity.\nAn apport rechristened \" epiphanism \" may look impressive, but\nso far we have no case of an apport above suspicion. I must decline\neither to accept the author's terminology or to follow him into the\nlabyrinth of divisions and subdivisions by which he laboriously\nclassifies his phenomena. Suffice it to say that in this first volume\nhe discusses apparitions as \" phantasmal metapsychorragy \", in a\n\fApeil 1939 Reviews 59\nsecond volume he will deal witli \" metacinetic metapsychorragy \",\nand more are to follow.\nThe author categorically rejects the hypothesis of post mortem\nagency ; an apparition, as distinct from a purely subjective hal-\nlucination, arises, he says, from the \" metapsychism \" of the per-\ncipient or one of the percipients. In many cases, he maintains, the\nobjective character of the phantasm cannot be doubted, and this\napplies not only to human apparitions but also to such cases as that\nof the Eev. W. Mountford {Phantasms of the Living, vol. ii, p. 97),\nwhere a whole carriage figured in the phantasmal scene ; this car-\nriage also was projected, Dr Bret tells us, by \" ectoplasy \"\n(p. 286).\nIt seems easier to think that such cases are due to supernormal\nperception, arising we know not how, of a similar scene which\noccurred in the past and became \" impressed \" on\u2014we know not\nwhat, nor how!\nAnimal phantasms, the author tells us (Dr Bret seems very sure\nof his \" explanations \" and is sometimes rather hard on those who\n\" explain \" supernormal occurrences differently), are produced\neither by a medium's \" metapsychism \" or by that of the animal\nrepresented (p. 307).\nIn connection with phantasms in general the case of Katie King\nis discussed, Dr Bret stating unambiguously that this '\"\nwill\nremain a sadder and more shameful episode in the history of science\nthan the condemnation of Galileo by the Inquisition ; for we see in\nit all the official scientists (Crookes excepted) yielding to their\n'misoneist'i feelings\". Dr Bret does not envisage the possibility\nof fraud either in this case or in Crookes's experiments with Mrs\nA. E. Fay (p. 296).\nEnough has been said to enable the reader to form a judgment on\nthis volume and on the attitude of its learned author. But let me\nemphasise again that in calling our attention to so many spon-\ntaneous incidents showing a pmnd facie case for the operation of\ncauses as yet unrecognised by science, many of them carefully sifted\nand verified, the author has deserved the gratitude of those who\napproach the subject in a scientific and dispassionate spirit.\nPerovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.\n1 \" Misoneism \" : hatred of novelty.\n\f60 Journal of Society for Psychical Besearch April 1939\nE.S.P.

In his case it took a curious form.\nHe called one of his rheumaticky legs his Catholic leg and the other\nhis Protestant leg ; and however cold the weather, insisted on keep-\ning the Protestant leg outside the bed and completely uncovered to\npunish it for belonging to such a wicked faith. He was a southern\nIrishman. If he had been from the north of Ireland the poor\nCatholic leg would have been just as fanatically exposed to the\nwinter cold. I have no doubt every race has its own failings. But\nthis episode, which illustrated our national failing, fanaticism, so\nwell, made a profound impression on me as a child. And in later\nyears when my mediumship began to develop I determined neither\nto cherish a dogmatic scepticism nor a dogmatic spiritualism. I\nleave to others to decide whether I have produced phenomena that\nsuggest the continuity of human personality or of memory in some\nform after death.\nFor the last fifteen years I have worked principally with Miss\nE. B. Gibbes and have lived in her house for the greater part of that\ntime. She has been my principal sitter. We have worked along\n\fMay 1939 Experiments in Automatic Writing 63\ntwo lines. I have produced four books of early Christian history\nthrough automatic writing, also two short books, The Road to\nImmortality and Beyond Human Personality. These last purport to\nbe communicated by the late F. W. H. Myers. Secondly, we have\nmade experiments in psychometry and I have received by automatic\nwriting or on the ouija board a number of communications purporting\nto come from recently deceased persons which have contained some\ninformation unknown to me, and occasionally unknown to Miss Gibbes,\nwhich she has afterwards verified. I have also had other sitters for\nwhom I have, in their opinion, obtained some evidential material.\nBefore discussing evidence of survival I should like to tell you of\nour one detective thriller, a case of psychometry we christened\n\" The Burglar's Glove \". A burglary had taken place at Miss\nGibbes's house. Miss Gibbes writes :\n\" When a member of the\nC.I.D. called to see me about the psychometry of the Burglar's\nGlove he said that he 'was amazed that a clairvoyante could obtain\nfrom any object, so accurate a description of an individual who was\nstrongly suspected of housebreaking '.\"\nNow, no medium should be her own reporter. With the best will\nin the world she may unconsciously gild the lily. So I will give Miss\nGibbes's account of this case. She writes :\n\" During my absence for a few days one Christmas, my small\nhouse in Chelsea was ransacked from top to bottom. Almost every-\nthing of value except books, furniture and pictures, etc., was re-\nmoved. The stuff was taken in my own suitcases and a car must\nhave been employed, for my heavy office typewriter was among the\nmany missing articles. In the prevailing chaos I discovered a\nstranger's leather gauntlet glove.\n\" At the time of the burglary Miss Cummins was in Ireland. When\nwriting to her I mentioned what had occurred but refrained from\nstating that this article had been left behind. I had in mind the\nidea that an interesting experiment might be made in connection\nwith it. She returned at the end of January. Before recommencing\nour work I suggested that we should have a sitting with the ouija\nboard for the purpose of '\ndoing a little psychometry for a friend\nof mine'. Miss Cummins assented. She knew nothing of the object\nto be psychometrised as I had carefully concealed the glove. She\ntold me later that she never for an instant associated the glove with\nthe burglary, with cars or with myself in any way.\n\" I put the glove on the ouija board and shortly afterwards Miss\nCummins's hand began to move and '\nAstor ', one of her controls,\nwrote his name. The following are the notes taken down by me at\nthe time :\n\f64 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1939\n\" Astor comes. (1)\n'\nThis glove seems to have belonged to some man\nwho has been recently in contact with machines. I feel that a machine\nwas throbbing under the hand that wore this glove when last it was\nupon it. This is the most recent feeling I get from it. The owner is a\ncurious mixture. I feel that the man who wore it had a love of adven-\nture and also was easily tired of the humdrum in life. I see this person\nin some rather dark place. It is like a shed or a place in which you\nkeep cars. Yes, I see him round it, coming and going as if he had some\nplan in mind.\n\" (2)\n'\nHe is a disappointed person. He should have done very well,\nbeen most successful. Everything in the earlier part of his life promised\nworldly success\u2014after hard work of course. But I think some unex-\npected catastrophe cut across his life. It did not seem a catastrophe at\nthe time, but it led to his having to give up his work and changed his\nlife completely for some time. He came out of all that a changed man.\nI see that it broke up his Ufe. He was unable to pick up the old threads\n\u2014circumstances had changed. His livelihood was taken by someone\nelse. He could not get back to the old work, his health wasn't good.\nHe had been through so much. All this hangs about this glove, and\nyet it seems as if it were a memory implanted on another memory, the\none overcomes the other. I hope this glove has not been handled except\nby the owner.'\n\" (B. B. G. No, not very much so far as I know. Can youget a descrip-\ntion of the oimer?)\n\" '\nEven if it has only been worn by one person I get a second party in\nit, somebody whose thoughts have been worked into the glove.'\n\"\n(3) [Astor went on :]\n'\nI see a man who looks delicate and seems to\nsuffer from nerves. I get a sense of mental distress at times, but there\nis nothing mentally wrong. I only got sensitiveness, that is the chief\nfeeling\u2014someone very highly strung.'\n\" (E. B. G. Can youget a description of the darkplace ?)\n\"\n(4) 'I only see him vaguely. He seems to be very worried and to\nbe set on some plan that is wrong in some way. Yes, I don't Uke all\nthat part. I get a feeling here of something unpleasant. What is it?\nThis man is doing something I don't like at all. I see him now driving\nin the dark. There are two others with him. He is on some business\nwith them. They talk in low voices. He is in this matter rather\nagainst his will I think.

She goes on to say :\n\" He telephoned to me saying that\nthe record contained an exact description of a man he had strongly\nsuspected of being implicated in my burglary. This individual had\njust been convicted of a series of crimes and sentenced to a term of\nimprisonment. A little later the detective returned me the type-\nscript with his marginal notes.\n' These run as follows :\n\" As to Paragraph 1 :\n'\nB. A. was the owner of a motor car and\ngarage.'\n\" As to Paragraph 2 and 3 : 'He is the son of a publican. Later\nmarried, but the wife broke away and carried on an immoral life.\nHe was turned out of business by his father, owing to his marriage.\nLater turned thief. Well-spoken and of good appearance, also\nhighly strung.'\n\" As to Paragraph 4. '\nAnswers description of B. A.'\n\" As to Paragraph 6. '\nAgain answers description of B. A., i.e.,\nthat of the \" gentleman \", and B. A. served in the Army.'\n\" In a subsequent interview, the detective informed me that the\ndescription in paragraph 4, was '\na very accurate one of the man\nin question with the exception of the small moustache which it is\n\f66 Jouriuil of Society for Psychical Research May 1939\nquite possible lie had at the time '. These facial appendages, he ex-\nplained, are often grown for a few weeks for the purpose of disguise.\n\" With regard to the information given through the ouija board,\nit must be remembered that Miss Cummins had no idea whatever\nthat the glove was connected with the burglary. To her sub-\nconscious mind, however, the type of glove might suggest cars and\ngarages, but the sensation of '\nthrobbing '\nneed not necessarily have\nbeen the most recent feeling connected with it.\n\" Par. 2. This seems to be a brief and accurate history of the\nemotional side of the man's life. As the son of a publican his future\nwould promise '\nworldly success '. The fact that his wife had left\nhim and had carried on an immoral life would certainly have been\n'\nan unexpected catastrophe cutting across his life '.\nTo the owner\nof the glove, his marriage naturally was '\nnot a catastrophe at the\ntime '.\nBut as he was turned out of his father's business, it certainly\n'\nled to his having to give up his work '\nand would '\nchange his life\ncompletely . . . breaking it up '. The detective states that '\nlater\nhe turned thief '. Information through the ouija board gives it as\n'\ncircumstances had changed ... he could not get back to the old\nwork '.\n\" Pars. 4 and 6 apparently give an accurate description of the\nappearance of a man subsequently arrested and could be put together\nas follows :\n\" The gentleman of the party has rather pale blue eyes and a short\nweak chin. A pale face and a small moustache. Medium coloured\nhair, a short nose, age about 35.\n\" In addition to the above description (which the detective said\nwas remarkably accurate) the man's emotional life was correctly\ndescribed by the psychometrist. Yet it is hardly likely that the\nglove was in the burglar's possession at the time of his break with\nhis people. Moreover, into the details is woven the possible adven-\nture of the night in question and of another similar incident.\"\nI mentioned previously that I had produced through automatic\nwriting, books that give a detailed history of Early Christian times.\nThe manuscripts of these Cleophas Scripts were submitted to\nDr Oesterly and, as Dr Lamond has stated in his introduction to\nthe Second Edition, to \" recognised scholars representing the Church\nand the Universities \". These authorities write in their Foreword\nthat these Cleophas Scripts \" contain much, which, on consideration\nof the life and mentality of the intermediary, Miss Cummins, appear\nquite inexplicable on the supposition of human authorship \". These\nscholars give instances of obscure historical facts that appear in the\ntext, which I could not have known, to support this assertion.\n\fMay 1939 Experiments in Automatic Writing 67\nThere is not time to discuss in detail the evidence presented in\nthese scripts. But it may be that this faculty for picking up\nhistorical facts is in line with experiments in psychometry of objects\nand might be placed under the heading of psychometry. In other\nwords that I may have drawn on a memory which is somehow\npreserved. But there are many people, including Miss Gibbes, who\naffirm that there must be some discarnate mind to present these\nfacts intelligently and in correct order in this long history of Apos-\ntolic times. I am in a trance or half- sleep when these scripts are\nwritten. I have very little sense of the words set down when I come\nout of the trance. But I often have vivid visual memories of the\npeople and scenes described, and I have experienced when in trance\nfanatical anger, sorrow, exaltation and despair according to the\nemotions expressed in the writing. I may of course be the plaything\nof my subconscious mind. But what is this subconscious mind?\nA very contrary one in my case. For I should infinitely prefer to\nwrite rapidly and effortlessly\u2014as in the case of this automatic\nwriting\u2014about modern times.\nSince the publication of these Cleophas Scripts some evidential\nfacts of interest have been brought to our notice. The Rev. J. M.\nBlack, of Edinburgh, stated in an article published in Light that in\nThe Great Days ofEphesus, the third volume of the Cleophas Scripts,\nthere is a satisfactory solution offered to the problem of the author-\nship of the Fourth Gospel, a problem that has been debated by\ntheologians for the last hundred years.\nDr Robert Eisler, who is a leading Continental scholar and was\nProfessor of Historical Research at Vienna University, recovered\npassages from an ancient Russian document, the suppressed Slavo-\nnic Josephus. These passages, he asserted, were excised from\nJosephus and were, he maintained, historically correct. He\npublished them in his book. The Messiah Jesus. Some years before\nits publication Paul in Athens, the second volume of the Cleophas\nScripts, was published. In several particulars, notably an insurrec-\ntion at Jerusalem just before the Crucifixion, statements in Paul\nin Athens were corroborated in Eisler's version of these suppressed\npassages. An article by Miss Gibbes giving details of this evidence\nwill shortly be published in the American Journal for Psychical\nResearch, so I shall not go into them now. Before his death that\neminent scholar Mr G. R. S. Mead was very helpful in regard to this\ncase. I am sorry to say that Dr Eisler is now in an internment camp.\nBut I feel I had better pass on to cases that may furnish evidence\nof personal survival. Several years ago I gave sittings to a lady\nI will call Mrs Cooper. I knew nothing of her past history. I\n\f68 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1939\nobtained for her some evidence of identity which purported to be\ngiven by a captain J. M. who had been killed in the South African\nWar. But as the evidence given by this commmiicator was known\nto Mrs Cooper, though unknown to me, she concluded that I might\nhave received it telepathically from her mind. So she asked the\nalleged communicator to give some obscure evidence she would\nhave to trace for herself. Amongst several things he subsequently\nwrote which were unknown to her, but afterwards verified, was a\nstory which, thanks to Miss Newton's efforts, was eventually\ncorroborated. It ran as follows. Captain J. M. communicated\nthat the second battalion of his regiment had met the first battalion\nat a certain military station in India before the South African War.\nIt is, I am told, very unusual for two battalions to meet in this\nfashion. So Mrs Cooper was doubtful of this statement. The\nautomatic writing went on to say that a couple of officers, whose\nnames were given, had gone on the spree. They had. in the course\nof it, broken into the garden of a high caste Hindu. There had been\na very serious row as the Hindu had believed they were trying to\nbreak into the women's quarter in his house. It was with difficulty\nthe matter was huslied up. Now, I have never met anyone remotely\nconnected with this regiment, and I have passed most of my life in\nIreland. The regiment was Scottish. I was a very small child at\nthe time this alleged episode took place. But Mrs Cooper, through\nyour Society, got into touch with a member of this regiment who\nwas able to verify the fact and that it was hushed up. So there\nwould seem to be no conceivable way in which it could have reached\nmy ears. The details of this case were published in the S.P.R.\nJournal for May 1929. It is to be noted that allusions were made\nto obscure happenings that took place thirty years before. The\nname of the mihtary station and the names given of officers were\ncorrect. The communicator stated he had been told of this episode\nby an officer also dead, and that he had not been with his regiment at\nthe time of its occurrence. This last fact was also correct. As Mrs\nCooper has written to me, the evidence about X. really does\npractically eliminate the idea of telepathy. At least, it would have\nto be between your mind and that of a very old soldier who remem-\nbered this affair, and the names and everything. And even in this\nunlikely case there would have to be something to start the tele-\npathy, put you en raffart. Still it is the other things, not hard\nfacts, which I have got through you which have convinced me.\"\nIn other words, Mrs Cooper held that the personality, the phrases\nused, the outlook were those of the man she had known over thirty\nyears ago. Convincing proof in the form of personality, outlook\n\fMay 1939 Experiments in Automatic Writing 69\nand style, is, in my opinion, the crucial test and the most interesting\nform of evidence.\nWith regard to the evidence of style, I mentioned a book that\npurported to be communicated to me by the late F. W. H. Myers\ncalled The Road to Immortality. Apart from a few cross references\nbetween myself and Mrs Osborne Leonard the only kind of evidence\noffered by this book is one of style and ideas. Now it is said that a\nman only becomes a character when he loses his character. I lost\nmine irretrievably through this book. My undoing happened in\nthis way.\nSome years ago I was invited to lecture in a certain provincial\ntown. In due course a card announcing the meeting, which was\nposted to 300 people, was sent to me. On it was written \" Speaker,\nMiss G. Cummins, Writer of '\nThe Koad to Immorality ', 15 years\nexperience. ...\" When I arrived at the hall for that meeting I\nfound it packed to the doors. Never before or since have I been such\na popular draw. I had at last gained a character by losing it.\nMany people will probably feel that the material in this book is\nmerely a fantasy woven by my subconsciousness, just as by the\nelimination of one letter from a card a remarkable fantasy was\nwoven about my past life. On the other hand two old friends of\nMr Myers, Sir Oliver Lodge and Sir Lawrence Jones, have stated\nthat they consider the contents of this book to be characteristic of\nthe style and ideas of Mr Myers. I feel that only Mr Myers's friends\nand contemporaries are in a position to give an opinion on this issue.\nI was a very small child living in Ireland when F. W. H. Myers died.\nAll I dare venture to state is that my conscious mind could not have\noriginated these writings. But I do not hesitate to suggest that\nevidence of identity given through style and ideas must always be\nhighly controversial ; and for this reason. If it is assumed that\nthere is a genuine communicator he appears to use the brain and the\nverbal memory of the automatist. So such writing must be\nregarded as a collaboration and due allowance made for what is even\non the spiritistic hypothesis the product of two personalities, not one.\nSome years ago I gave a sitting to two old people who were most\nanxious to obtain a communication from their relations. Much\nto my disappointment and theirs a strange communicator insisted\non writing during the first quarter of an hour. He gave his name\nas Henry Bois, Highfield Koad, Preston. It meant nothing to the\ntwo old people, to myself or to Miss Gibbes, who was present. Miss\nGibbes writes :\n\" The statement was made that this entity had just died and that\nhe knew his wife was grieving. There was an insistent request\n\f70 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1939\nthat she should be traced and be assured of the continued existence\nof her husband. I followed up these remarks and eventually\ncorresponded with the widow at the address given in the automatic\nscript. There was some difficulty in my getting in touch with her\nowing to the fact that in the writing the name was spelt Bois and the\nactual name was Boyce. It has the same sound and was possibly\ncommunicated phonetically. Or Miss Cummins's subconscious mind\nbetrayed her as she knew a man of the name of Henry Bois, who,\nat the time, lived in the East, but had no connection with the\ncommunicator. The widow of Henry Boyce subsequently corro-\nborated eight of the statements made by this communicator as being\ncorrect, including a description of her husband's personal appearance\nand the condition of his health for some time prior to his death.\n\" The following are the facts acknowledged by his widow. (1) Her\nhusband had recently died (5 days after his death his name was\nwritten by Miss C). (2) He was in the fifties. (His age, the widow\nstated, was 55.) (3) He was of medium height (correct). (4) He\nwas dark (correct). (5) He had retired from business, that is, he\nhad not been fit for it for some time. (Partially correct ; the\nwidow wrote :\n'\nHe was ailing for 2 years, but kept going to business.\nHe was not fit to go, but would not give in.') (6) He was not ill for\nvery long. (' He died 3 days after the doctor was called in.') (7)\nThe widow would not believe in the survival of her husband when\ninformed of his message (correct). (8) That he had a wife also\nproved correct.\"\nMiss Gibbes enquired at the ofiices of certain newspapers and\ncould find no announcement of his death. In order to obtain the\nnecessary information Miss Gibbes wrote a series of questions to the\nwidow. Possibly hoping that a legacy might be forthcoming the\nwidow answered the questions readily.\nHere we have a case which Miss Gibbes believes can only be\nexplained by the spiritistic hypothesis. It is a case which has\nalways puzzled me. But it is possible that my mind linlied up with\nthe mind of a woman unknown to me and that I received tele-\npathically from her this correct information about her husband. On\nthe other hand, it is hard to explain why my mind should work\nentirely contrary to my very keen desire to obtain a message that\nwould comfort the two old people who were sitting with me. But\nthis can possibly be explained by the fact that I am an Irishwoman\nand come of a contrary race. So my rebellious subconscious out\nof sheer contrariness rejected my conscious wish to please the old\npeople. But the \" Henry Bois \" communication was expressed in an\nemotional manner and in pathetic terms. There seemed to be a\n\fMay 1939 Experiments in Automatic Writing 71\npassionate desire behind it to convince the widow that Henry Boyce\nwas alive in another world, and there was also the fear expressed\nthat she could not believe in her husband's continued existence.\nMy subconscious mind, however, may have a turn for drama and\npossibly built up an emotional fantasy round the correct evidence\ngiven in the writing and telepathically received by me.\nThe difficulty of giving addresses correctly is frequently met with\nand is illustrated by a case Sir William Barrett related in his book\nOn the Threshold of the Unseen. It was one in which I participated\nat the ouija board in conjunction with Mrs. Dowden, and obtained\na message which we believed for a short time directly emanated\nfrom the sitters' subconscious minds because a wrong address was\ngiven and because the communication purported to come from a\ndistant relative of the sitter. In an article in the Sunday Graphic\nSir Oliver Lodge referred to it as \" a remarkable case which seemed\nto prove survival.\" Sir W. Barrett describes it as follows :\n\" Miss C, the sitter, had a cousin, an officer with our army in\nFrance, who was killed in a battle a month previous to the sitting ;\nthis she knew. One day, after the name of her cousin had unex-\npectedly been spelt out on the ouija board and her name given in\nanswer to her query, '\nDo you know who I am? '\nthe following\nmessage came :\n'\nTell mother to give my j^earl tie-pin to the girl I\nwas going to marry ; I think she ought to have it.' \"When asked\nwhat was the name and address of the lady both were given ; the\nname spelt out included Christian name and surname, the latter\nbeing an unusual one and unknown to both the sitters. The\naddress given in London was either fictitious or taken down in-\ncorrectly, as a letter sent there was returned and the whole message\nthought to be fictitious.\n\" Six months later, however, it was discovered that the officer\nhad been engaged, shortly before he left for the front, to the very\nlady whose name was given ; he had, however, told no one. Neither\nhis cousin nor any of his own family were aware of the fact and had\nnever seen the lady nor heard her name until the War Office sent\nover the deceased officer's effects. Then they found that he had put\nthis lady's name in his will, and what is equally remarkable, a pearl\ntie-pin was found in his effects.\" Sir William Barrett goes on to\nsay, \" Here there could be no explanation of the facts by subliminal\nmemory, or telepathy or collusion, and the evidence points un-\nmistakably to a telepathic message from the deceased officer.\"\nI want to emphasise one particular point in this case. When we\nlearnt through the return of the letter that a wrong address had been\ngiven we did not follow up the matter further, believing the com-\n\f72 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1939\nmunication in question to be subconscious invention. It was only\nthrough a chance conversation that we learnt that the message was\ncorrect in its main particulars. At the time it was received I was\na complete sceptic as to phenomena and this was the first case within\nmy own personal experience which encouraged me to pursue psychic\nenquiry further.\nNow I should like to make a few remarks about the investigator\nin his approach to the medium : the methods of some very in-\ntelligent sitters I have met show such strange ignorance and con-\nfusion of mind.\nAbout fourteen years ago a friend of mine asked me to give\na sitting with the ouija board to a certain authority on economics\nand his wife. I will call them Mr and Mrs Thompson. I went\nwith my friend Captain Spencer to their house. Astor, my con-\ntrol, opened the sitting by describing an old man who was recog-\nnised by Mr Thompson as his father. The nickname and surname\nof the alleged communicator were given and he took control,\naddressing his son. Immediately Mr Thompson told his wife not\nto utter a word because he said it might set up a telepathic link\nbetween them and me and render evidence valueless. Furthermore\nhis wife and he removed their chairs to the other end of a room\nlonger and larger than the S.P.R. library. There they remained\nwrapped in a rigid silence, and they resembled a pair of deaf mutes\nwhen the communicator asked if his son was there. On receiving\nno response he became discouraged and soon faded away, giving\nplace to a communicator for Captain Spencer, who had remained\nclose by and reciprocated the greeting of the entity who came for\nhim. Naturally, therefore, this communicator held the floor, or I\nshould say the ouija board, for the rest of the sitting. Afterwards\nMr and Mrs Thompson expressed disappointment at getting nothing.\nI completely failed to make them understand that telepathy was not\neliminated by the length of the room and by complete silence. As\nevery member of the S.P.R. probably knows, the intelligent sitter\nshould not remain completely passive but should at least make some\nremark to encourage an alleged communicator. He can do this\nwithout giving anything away. Even if he is a complete sceptic\nit is necessary for him if he wishes to obtain evidence to assume\nthat someone is there speaking to him when a name he recognises\nis given. Sometimes, of course, a sitter may be too forthcoming.\nI remember a lady, who as soon as her mother's name was given on\nthe ouija board broke into voluble abuse of the alleged communicator\nfor having disinherited her. In vain the mother tried to get a word\nin edgeways in reply. It was quite impossible. For the rest of the\n\fMay 1939 Experiments in Automatic Writing 73\nsitting the sitter continued to lecture and hurl invective at the\nunseen mother. In parting this lady seemed intensely happy and\nrelieved in mind, thanking me profusely for what she called a very\nevidential sitting.\nAnother type of sitter is the individual who possesses the blue-\nbook mind, who has a passion for obscure facts. One of these,\nwhom I will call Mr White, pressed me to give him a sitting. He\nhad been to every leading medium, and had according to his own\naccount received little or nothing from them. Soon after the\nopening of the sitting a distant cousin spelt out his name on the board\nand correctly narrated the circumstances of his death in a naval\nbattle. Mr Wliite then addressed his cousin, asking him if he\nremembered the name of a tree on an island in a lake they had fished\ntogether fifteen years previously, and also could he remember the\ncolour of the wallpaper of the library in the home in which he had\nspent his childhood. The communicator failed to answer these two\nquestions satisfactorily, but mentioning his sister's name sent an\naffectionate message to her. Whereat Mr \\Vhite solemnly replied :\n\" Because you have not told me the colour of the wall paper in the\nlibrary of your fiist home I fear I cannot convey your message to\nyour sister. Sufficient proof of your identity has not been furnished,\nas you will certainly recognise, by your failure to answer my two\nquestions.\" All the same it will be noted that Mr White apparently\nassumed that the communicator was there. But in spite of having\nattended hundreds of sittings this Mr \"White, who was a man of no\nmean intelligence, had not learnt that correct answers to direct\nquestions concerning trivial memories of fifteen or twenty-five\nyears ago are seldom answered satisfactorily. In this respect the\nmemories of living people are equally faulty. For instance, I was,\nrecently, suddenly asked if I could remember the year in which I\nplayed hockey for Ireland against England. But to my shame I\nutterly failed to recall a year which was, to one of my inadequate\nathletic powers, distinctly memorable. I don't know it even now.\nAnd I have a horrible feeling that if I die without finding it out I shall\nbe denounced and dismissed as a deceiving shade by intelligent sitters.\nIt is reported that when Edison was pre-occupied with some\nabsorbing experiment he occasionally forgot his own name. I have\nnot myself so far reached that blissful state of forgetfulness. In\nthis sphere, perhaps, it is the privilege of genius only. But I quite\nexpect to forget it when I go to the next world. However, I would\nsuggest that students of psychic science should study the memories\nof the living when they are endeavouring to test the memories of\nalleged commimicators.\n\f74 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1939\nIncidentally I may mention that Mr White was extremely anxious\nto get those trivial memories communicated. So he was quite\nemotionally tense when asking for them. He had already clearly\nmade up his mind that they would not be given and had recounted\nto me his failures with other sensitives. Now this was an entirely\nwrong attitude to adopt. It undoubtedly tends to inhibit the\ngiving of the desired evidence by making the medium anticipate\nher own possible failure.\nRecently a certain Italian whom Miss Gibbes and I have never\nmet sent Miss Gibbes the handwriting of his dead wife and asked her\nto have proxy sittings with me. Subsequently Signor V. wrote to\nMiss Gibbes telling her that before his wife's death he had arranged\nwith her a statement that she was to try and get through to him.\nFor eighteen years he had gone to mediums and failed to obtain it.\nAt the first sitting my hand wrote his wife's Christian name. It was\nnot known to me or to Miss Gibbes. After an interval of time we held\ntwo more sittings at which messages from the husband were read to\nthe communicator. They gave nothing away but assumed that his\nwife was there listening. She wrote affectionate letters in reply.\nIn one of these, quite casually, the desired pre-arranged state-\nment, or rather its idea, was given correctly. Now I believe that\nif Signor V. had taken the sittings with me he would never have\nobtained that piece of evidence. He would have been too anxious\nand emotional about it. I attribute his failure with other mediums,\nwho are far more successful than I am in giving evidence, to the\nfact that he was the sitter and was too emotionally anxious. I\nbelieve that the best evidence as regards facts is most often given\nspontaneously through a medium. A chance remark of a sitter\nmay elicit it, or a question that is not of the blue-book character.\nWhen in search of personal evidence from a deceased friend or\nrelative the sitter's psychological attitude is all-important, in my\nexperience. A little histrionic ability may be extremely valuable.\nHowever much the sitter may doubt, once a correct name or\ndescription is given he should assume for the time being that he\nis actually talking to the individual in question. Again, the\nsitter should recall to his mind conditions in this earthly life of\nours. I for instance am rather a timid person. When I meet an\nindividual who treats me with suspicion or catechises me sternly\nI am either reduced to a frozen silence or stutter out banalities.\nThis failing would be a hundred times intensified if I had to\nmanipulate as well some complicated receiving instrument like\nthat of another human brain. The medium has the responsibility\nof transmission. But with regard to mental mediumship at any rate\n\fMay 1939 Experiments in Automatic Writing 75\nthe sitter must play his part in making the necessary link. This\nfact is rather well expressed in a sentence conveyed through auto-\nmatic writing some years ago. \" The medium is like a pipe or tube.\nWe blow the message through. If there is no suction at the other\nend it will stick halfway and no evidence will be given.\"\nPsychical Eesearch is undoubtedly a branch of experimental\npsychology of increasing importance. In the Cleophas Scripts,\nPaul in Athens, The Great Days of Ephesus, and a forthcoming\nvolume, When Nero Was Dictator, psychologists will probably find\ntraces of an industrious subconscious mind, but these Cleophas\nScripts contain a residuum of facts which University scholars\nmaintain could not have been known to me. These experts have\nalso pointed out that the Cleophas Scripts have an atmosphere\nthat is of the period ;\nthat in manner they strongly resemble the\nClementine Recognitions, Apocryphal writings which I had not\nread or even heard of when the scripts were written.\nLastly, the Burglar's Glove, the Cooper Case, the Pearl Tie-Pin\nCase, the Boyce Case and others I have no time to mention, present\na number of verified facts w-hich were entirely unknown to me\nand the sitter. Miss Gibbes believes she can show evidence that\nin automatic writing I have reproduced about thirty different\npersonalities and written in their varied styles. The psychologist\ncan maintain, probably rightly, that I have thirty different secon-\ndary personalities. But what about the evidential facts conveyed\nthrough me and verified in connection with deceased persons?\nI am prepared to admit that my subconscious mind is that almost\nextinct phenomenon, an industrious maid of all work. But I\nshould like psychologists to explain by what process I pilfer from\nhere and there a certain amount of accurate information with which\nI build up these subconscious fantasies. If they would only\nexplain the process to me, and how to control and direct it, I would\nturn it to good purpose. I would tap the minds of thinkers and\nauthors I admire, and settle down to writing books and plays, and\nrenounce Psychical Research for ever.\nREVIEW\nThe Theory and Practice of Yoga. By Sardar Sulakhan Singh.\n(From Sulakhan Singh, P.O. Sulakhan Abad, Gujranwala,\nIndia. 4s. post free.)\nIt is said, by those who should know, that many of the faculties\nand phenomena with which psychical research is concerned become\nincreasingly evident as a by-product of the yoga discipline, and\n\f76 Journal of Society for Psychical Besearch May 1939\nthere is some interest in the subject, and inquiry about it, among\nmembers of the Society. These may like to know of a small hand-\nbook which sets out the original yogic \" aphorisms \" of Patanjali,\nwith a commentary that seems to be as direct and simple as could\nbe made for Western readers. This is not to say that the book is a\nvade mecum for the Western tourist in the world of Eastern ideas.\nBut those who have wished that they could have a few hours or\ndays of intercourse with an Indian who could explain what the\nyoga system signifies in his own mind, may find a book of this\nkind the nearest substitute for such an exposition.\nThe book has been printed in Central Europe for upwards of two\nyears and has been brought to our notice on its centre of distribu-\ntion being transferred to India.

Herbert, Mr Hettinger, Mr Kenneth Rich-\nmond, Mr Soal, Mr Strawson and Mr Tyrrell took part. It is hoped\nthat the paper will appear shortly in Proceedings.\nINCIDENTS OF BYGONE DAYS\nBy Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo\nOn 26 April I had the privilege of reading before the S.P.R. a paper\nI had entitled \" Incidents of Bygone days \", in which I had included\nvarious episodes, chiefly isolated, which had remained unmentioned\nin two previous papers read by me in 1937 and 1938 and dealing\nwith the Russian physical medium S. F. Sambor and \" Two series\nof experiments in automatic writing \" respectively.\nThe following is a brief summary of the episodes narrated by me :\n1. Incidents connected with the visit of Mrs A. E. Fay (Crookes'\ncelebrated medium) ^ to Russia in 1888-89. General impression\nvery unfavourable.\n2. Seances with various English mediums in London in 1892.\nTwo sittings with Husk were transparently fraudulent. F. W. H.\nMyers related to me a striking incident connected with Williams ;\nat a dark seance held, I think, in the seventies, a fully materialised\nhand seized by Myers melted away in his grasp. At a private seance\nwith Mme Greek, a trance medium, an interesting episode con-\nnected with my late mother occurred, the medium who knew\nf nothing about me stating that the lady who had given me a certain\nring \" had loved you for twenty years, and you have been mourning\nher for two years \". My mother had died in 1890, when I was\ntwenty years and a few months old.\n3. Production of artificial spirit raps (due to action of the toes)\nby myself. See Journal, S.P.R. ,\nJuly 1893. Aksakoff stated to me\nthat my raps were exactly similar in soixnd to those of Mrs Kate\nFox-Jencken.\n1 Or rather the medium who took part in one of Crookes' most celebrated\n(electric) tests.\n\f80 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1939\n4. Seances with Eusapia Paladino in Milan (1892) in St. Peters-\nburg, in the palace of the Grand Duke Nicholas, the future general-\nissimo of the Russian armies (1898), and at Naples. During the\nlatter series it happened that a \" third \" arm was seen, whilst one\nof E. P.'s hands was held upon the table and visible and the other\nthough invisible (on the table but under end of curtain) was felt\nby the controller (my wife) to be in contact with her hand. From\nwhich may be drawn the tentative conclusion that some mediums\nare apparently able at times to free a hand by some kind of mental\nsuggestion.\n5. Poltergeist \" phenomena \" witnessed by me at Reval (now\nTallinn, Estonia) in 1903, inconclusive either way.\n6. Seances with the late Polish physical medium, Jan Guzik, in\nSt. Petersburg. The medium was and is looked upon by me as a\nfraud\u2014and not even an interesting one.\n7. Seances with Eva Carriere (Marthe Beraud) in Paris in 1914.\n\" Phenomena \" inconclusive, Mme Bisson, the medium's \" guide,\nphilosopher and friend \" proving extremely \" touchy \" when doubts\nwere expressed even in a very mild way. Another instance, T think,\nwhen investigation is complicated by the presence of a person whom\nit is very difficult not to regard as the medium's alter ego.\n8. Prediction made in August 1917, in Oslo, as to the war ending\non Sunday, 10 November (no year given). As a matter of fact it\nended on Monday, 11 November. 1 may be said, with perhaps a\nlittle straining, to have heard of the prediction before its fulfilment.\nIn Part 11 of my paper I related various spontaneous cases known\nto me and hitherto unpublished in this country, viz. :\n(a) Post mortem, phantasm of M. B. appearing to his brother to\nask him to undertake a very long, tedious and possibly dangerous\nrailway journey (in S. Russia), in order to tell his widow to go\nabroad and not stay in Russia. Mme B. was at the time in a state\nof great perplexity on this subject.\n(h) Apparition apparently coinciding with death (suicide) un-\nknown to percipient who both saw and heard the phantasm, the\nlatter asking, in a concise formula, for prayers.\n(c) A case of levitation of a fakir (\"to twice the height of a five\nstoried building \") witnessed in May 1914 in India by a certain\nSchipovsky (see Zeitschrift fiir Kritisclien Okkuhismus, 1926, p. 196).\nI knew the late Schipovsky well in Berlin, in the early twenties, and\nam absolutely convinced of his good faith. I feel bound, however, to\nadd that during the war he experienced a severe shell-shock which\nfor a time affected his cerebral faculties, though when I knew him\nhe appeared to be perfectly normal.\n\fJune 1939 Case : The Detection of a Theft by a Medium 81\n(d) The last case is here quoted rather to exemplify one of tlie\nchief obstacles which confront a student when he attempts to\ncollect spontaneous cases of supernormal occurrences. In 1906, in\nSt. Petersburg, a Eussian naval officer told me he had once attended\nin India on board his ship a fakir's performance at which an attempt\nwas made to photograph it, the sensitised plate registering nothing.\nBut when I asked him for a written first-hand account, Captain\nB.-K. refused, though I offered to call on him (he lived some fifteen\nmiles from St. Petersburg) and bring and use my own typewriter,\nso as to spare him every trouble.\nSurely such a specimen of discourtesy and misdirected obstinacy\nis worth recording.\nCASE : THE DETECTION OF A THEFT THROUGH\nINFORMATION GIVEN BY A MEDIUM\nThe following is a translation of a case sent to the Research Officer\nby Dr A. Tanagras. of the Greek Society of Psychical Research :\nMadame Logothetopoulou, a lady of German birth, wife of the\nProfessor of Gynaecology at the University of Athens, was intending\nto go to an evening party, and in the morning had taken her jewels\nin her handbag : a pearl necklace, a ring, etc. These she had placed\nin her husband's private cupboard at the Aeginition \" hospital of\nthe University, meaning to wear them in the evening.\nThe jewels disappeared, and the police arrested a maid, whose\nfinger-prints were found inside the handbag.\nShe was held in custody for ten days unavailingly. She admitted\nthat she had opened the handbag to admire the jewels, hnt per-\nsistently refused to admit having stolen them.\nMme Logothetopoulou then applied to one of the best mediums\nof the Athenian S.P.R., a member of her telepathic group, ^ Mme\nHelene Zakynthinou, who, under hyjDuosis. stated emphatically that\nthe maid was innocent, and designated the hospital masseur as the\nthief.\nShe described how he had entered the professor's room, opened\nthe cupboard, stolen the jewels and given them into the care of his\nwife.\nMme Zakynthinou insisted that the stolen jewels were in a certain\npiece of furniture which she described, in the masseur's house.\n^ A group formed for experiments in telepatliy such as have been conducted\nof late, between Athens and London, with a similar group formed by the\nS.P.R.\n\f82 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1939\nThe police then detained the masseur's wife, who confessed the\ntheft and returned the stolen jewels. The thief had committed the\nact ivith gloves on, so as not to leave fingerprints, as he himself\neventually confessed.\nFollowing this, Mme Logothetopouloii sent the following letter to\nMme Zakynthinou :\nUniversity Hospiial \" Avfiinilion \". .\nDirector, Prof. C. Loyothctoponlos.\nMadame Zakynthinou.\u2014I have much pleasure in letting you know\nthat, thanks to your helj), 1 have been able to recover my stolen\njewels. The thief Ikis been arrested.\n(Signed) E. LoduxHiii'i'oi'uirLou.\n(The copy of tliis letter is signed by its writer and countersigned\nl)y Dr Tanagras as witness of the original, and Dr Tanagras's report\nis countersigned by both the ladies whose names are mentioned.)\nThe Research Officer wrote to Dr Tanagras pointing out that it\nwas not definitely stated, in the above rejDort, that the jewels had\nactually been found in a piece of furniture such as the medium had\ndescribed; and that without this evidence of paranormal perception\nthe medium's impression could be attributed to her being aware of\nsuspicions against the masseur's character. (A man who wears\ngloves to commit a theft is not unlikely to have a bad record.)\nDr Tanagras replied, giving a fuller account of tlie events following\nthe medium's statement :\n\"After Mme Zakynthinou's declaration that the masseur had given\nthe stolen jewels to his wife, who was keeping them in her chest-of-\ndrawers, a police officer visited this woman's house.\n\" He told her that her husband had been detained by the police,\nthat he had confessed the theft, and that there ^vas no sense now in\ndenying it. He therefore advised her not to make her position\nworse, but to give up the jewels.\n\" The woman then, trembling, opened the chest of drawers and\nrestored the jewels, which were in fact in this piece of furniture,^ as\nthe medium had insisted. After the discovery of the jewels the\nmasseur was detained, and confessed the theft.\n\" Your remark that if the jewels had not been found just in the\npiece of furniture which had been indicated, we could not have ex-\n^ Dr Tanagras appends the footnote : It is to be noted that one always\niinds, in all the honses of the CJreek jjeoplc, a piece of furniture with several\ndrawers, of the height of 1| metres, which they call a \" couimo \".\n\fJune 1939 Case : Precognitive Dream 83\neluded telepathic transmission to tlie medium ^ of suspicions even-\ntually entertained by Mnie Logotlietopoulou, is very true.\n\" My personal opinion is that it was a case of distant telepathy\nbetween the medium and the masseur or his wife, who knew the\ndetails of the theft and also the hidino;-place of the jewels.\nWhen the medium finds herself sjmchronised (attuned) with the\nguilty persons, we often observe really convincing successes in cases\nsuch as this. Lack of attunement is the cause of frequent failures.\"\nThis case is open to a, normal ('X2)lanation, of somewhat indefinite\nprobability, if there is any chance at all of the medium ha ving heard\nthe hospital masseur mentioned as a likely suspect. We gather\nfrom the record that tliere was a ])eriod of ten days during which the\ntheft could have been a subject of discussion. We should then need\nto assume that the medium made a chance guess (if she had no\nfurther information) at the complicity of the masseur's wife and at\nthe place where the jewels would be hidden. The choice of a drawer\nin a piece of furniture of a type regularly to be found, as Dr Tanagras\nsays, in Greek houses, seems fairly obvious ;\nthough in the case of a\nhiding-place it is not greatly to be expected that an obvious guess\nwiU be successful.\nIf the episode cannot be described as strongly evidential, it is of\ninterest as an example of the application of mediumistic methods to\ndetection, such as might be suggested by the case of the burglar's\nglove which was described by J\\Iiss Geraldine Cummins in the paper\nprinted in the last issue of the Journal. But it has to be remembered\nthat neither the truth of information received, apparently by para-\nnormal means, nor its outcome in successful jjolice action, proves\nthat the process of obtaining the information was of a paranormal\ncharacter.\nCASE : THE QUESTION OF MOTIVE IN AN\nAPPARENTLY PRECOGNITIVE DREAM\nBy Zoe Richmond\n[Attention has been increasingly drawn of late to the study of the\nprobable motives for impressions which seem to be both paranormal\nand purposeless. The following contribution to this study has been\n^ Dr Tanagras's implication that any knowledge of the person to be sus-\npected would have had to reach the medium by telejMthij, suggests that he is\nassm-ed that suspicions could not have reached her normally\u2014a point of some\nimportance.-\n\u2014\nEd.\n\f84 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1939\nmade by Mrs Kenneth Richmond, authoress of Evidence of Purpose\nin the \" Psychical Experiences \" series.]\nOn 27 September 1933 I hstened with great interest to Mrs Lyttel-\nton's Presidential Address, in which she dwelt specially on pre-\ncognition and asked members to put on record any precognitive\ndreams that they might have. That night I had the only precog-\nnitive dream that has registered itself in my conscious memory.\nIn this dream I saw four charabancs, all alike, filled with foreign\nstudents visiting London. These students were all wearing black\nastrakhan cajjs.\nThe dream strucJc me as so curious and senseless that 1 mentioned\nit to my husband on walfing.\nOn the same morning I took an unusual route to my office in\nHolborn in order to change some foreign money for a child who was\nstaying with us. I had intended for some days to change this money,\nand this was the first occasion on which I had spare time to go\nround to a bureau de change.\nAs I was about to enter the bureau, four charabancs passed,\nfilled with people all wearing black berets. Large labels on the\nwindscreens announced that the party belonged to a foreign student\norganisation.\nThe sight of them gave me a distinctly uncomfortable sensation,\na sense of strangeness at the close resemblance of the scene to the\none of which I had dreamt.\nThe dream showed no labels on the windscreens, but the informa-\ntion conveyed by these labels appears to have been represented by\nthe dream-impression that the occupants of the charabancs were\nforeign students. The only complete discrepancy was the appear-\nance of black astrakhan caps in the dream and black berets in the\nreality. I found at the time some more or less relevant association\nin my own mind (which I have now forgotten) to account for its\nintroducing the idea of astrakhan. It is also possible that the\ndream-mind, trying to emphasise the impression \" foreign \", intro-\nduced astrakhan caps as conveying a more foreign impression than\nplain berets. I know of other instances in which an aj^parently\nparanormal impression has departed from accuracy on some special\npoint, which has seemed to show a misguided effort somewhere in\nthe percipient's mind to improve upon an evidential feature.\nI have generally foimd that any psychical experiences that I have\nhad were in response to some need that could be traced, either my\nown or another's. In this case, it seems that the need was that\nimpressed upon my mind by Mrs Lyttelton in her Presidential\nAddress, for more recorded cases of precognitive dreaming. As I\n\fJune 1939 Notes on Periodicals 85\nhave noted, the dream appeared at first sight to be particularly\nsenseless, and was put on record for that reason.\n[Mr Kenneth Richmond made the following brief note in writing :\n\" Sept. 28, 33, 9 a.m. Z. told me dream of 4 charabancs full of\nforeign students in black astrakhan caps.\" Evidentially, it is to be\nregretted that the actual occurrence was not corroborated at the\ntime by discovering who organised the students' torn- and obtaining\nan independent description of the party.

Roux.\nA brief accoimt of the life and work of the late Dr Osty, Director\nof the Institute of Metapsychics in Paris. Having been attracted to\nthe study of metapsychics by his chance observation of character-\nreading by a hand-reader, he devoted himself more and more to the\nsubject as years went by and finally, in 1925, when, after the death\nof Dr Geley, he was appointed to the directorship of the Institute,\nhe gave up the practice of medicine to devote himself to the new\nscience.

H. E. Jong.\nDr Jong joins issue with Dr Dietz concerning his view that when\nMrs Piper produced Hawaiian words at a sitting, these words were\nundoubtedly derived from the consciousness of Mr Briggs who was\npresent at the sitting. Dr Jong thinks there are in this case con-\nsiderable difiiculties in the way of accepting a telepathic explanation\nof the facts. Neither is he inchned to think that \" something \" in\nMrs Piper tapped \" the content of Mr Briggs' consciousness.\nThough he thinks there is much to be said for a spiritistic explana-\ntion, he is not ready to accept this wholeheartedly either. He also\ncriticises Dr Dietz's attitude towards the case of Laura Edmonds\n(1854) who spoke Modern Greek correctly in trance, without knowing\nit in ordinary life. The article concludes with a criticism of Dr\nDietz's views concerning \" human radiation \".\nNotes and Information (Dr Tenhaeff).\n1. A case in which the spirit of an acquaintance of Mr S. H. G.\npurported to manifest through a \" psychopist \". Particulars were\ngiven of the acquaintance's death which were contrary to the infor-\nmation in possession of Mr S. H. G., but which some months after-\nwards he found to be true.\n2. A case in which a dying nun in the East Indies was heard by\nher father to call him as she was dying (he knew nothing of her ill-\nness). Simultaneously her brother dreamed of her. A letter from\nher Mother Superior is given as evidence that she called her father\nand spoke of her brother while unconscious just before her death.\n3. Dr. H. M. Haye makes some remarks on the difficulty of con-\nfirming \" supernormal \" cures, owing to the fact that in certain\ndiseases there are intervals when the patient seems to be well. He\ngives a curious case of a man with renal calculus who believed the\naffected kidney to have been removed by operation and apparently\nrecovered.\nH. E.

London was a first class passenger ship of the day,\noutward bound for Melbourne with 270 passengers.\nShe left the Thames on 1 January 1866 and ran into bad weather\nat once. Called at Plymouth (where one passenger landed on account\nof the gale). Encountered worse weather in the Bay of Biscay ; lost\npart of masts and gear ; tried to steam into the gale until the engine-\nroom hatch was stove in and engine-room flooded. All boats except\nthe port pinnace and two small ones were smashed. The captain\ndecided to run back to Plymouth and got round safely using sail\nonly. But the ship took in water aft and became waterlogged. No\none thought boats could live in the sea and as the decks were con-\ntinually awash, there was no possibility of making rafts. The\ncaptain assembled the passengers in the saloon and told them there\nwas no hojie for them. This was a good many hours before the ship\nsank, so that the occasion was exactly that in which some sort of\ndesperate action might be done such as \" John Whiteman \" regrets.\nJust before the ship sank, the port pinnace got away with 19, who,\nafter being nearly swamped, were rescued by an Italian steamer and\ntaken into Falmouth. These survivors gave long and detailed\nstories of the disaster.\nJust before the London sank, a rush was seen to be made for the\ntwo remaining boats, but it was ineffectual.\nThe Rev.

Bell, \" Psychical\nExperiences \" series. 3s. 6d. net.\nMr Richmond begins by discussing what we mean by \" identity\n\"\nas applied to human beings, and the way in which we identify indi-\nviduals in ordinary everyday life. He points out that \" we take a\nperson's identity for granted from a first general impression, without\nbothering about details, if we have known the person beforehand ;\nor we simply accept someone's statement, '\nThat is John Smith '\n;\nand we go on taking his identity for granted unless something makes\nus realise we are mistaken \". We accordingly start with something\nof a handicap in judging the identity of \" communicators \" from\nthe kind of evidence likely to be available. This he divides into\ntwo main classes, primary, as identifying \" the communicator as a\nconsistent and characteristic personality \", and secondary, as\nidentifying him by the things with which he can be associated ; he\npoints out that much evidence shows a combination of the features\nof both classes. After discussing briefly various special forms of\nevidence, such as posthumous sealed letters, and proxy sittings, he\nadds, \"It is best to recognise that we have no absolute test of\nhuman identity whatever \", but that elaborate cross-correspondences\nare \" the nearest thing to proof that I know \".\nIn the following five chapters examples are given of different\nforms of evidence. These include quotations from proxy sittings,\nthe '\nOscar Wilde '\nscripts, some of the results obtained by a group\nof amateur investigators in New York and published by the A.S.P.R.\nunder the name of Le Livre des Revenants, a case reported by Mr Soal\n\fJuly 1939 Revieivs 97\nfrom his sittings with Mrs Blanche Cooper, and the \" Lethe \" case,\nin which commimications were received from Mrs Piper showing\nclassical knowledge far beyond her normal powers, but highly\ncharacteristic of F. W. H. Myers, from whom the commmiications\nclaimed to come. The selection is therefore well diversified. Each\nexample puts the prol)lem of identity in a dift'erent hght.\nIn a brief concluding chapter Mr Richmond emphasises \" that\npsychical research has to do with personal experience carried into\nan impersonal region \", and that \" Science separates out and leaves\naside the personal and private elements in an experience without\ndenying anything of their reality for the individuals concerned,\nsimply because its business is with public reality. The question is\nhow much of an experience can be set out so as to make it common\nproperty \". The criticism is sometimes levelled against the positive\nevidence provided by psychical research that, v\/hile it looks im-\npressive at a first glance, its cogency diminishes on close scrutiny\n;\nand there are indeed many cases, badly observed and badly recorded,\nwhich fully deserve criticism of this kind. But the critic often for-\ngets that there is also a great mass of evidence, which, sometimes\nbecause of the incalculable, but valid, personal and private elements\ninvolved, and sometimes because of its complexity, is in reality\nmuch more impressive than it can be made to appear to the\nordinary reader. W. H. S.\nBehold, this Dreamer ! By Walter de la Mare. Faber. 21s. net.\nThere are many ways of looking at the dream-life of man ; in\npsychical research we are chiefly concerned with the dream as one\nof the ways by which subliminal thought and imagery may reveal a\ncontent beyond normal perception. We are also concerned to some\nextent with the psychological study of dreaming. Mr de la Mare is\nconcerned, in this fine anthology, with the dream in literature ;\nand,\nin his long and profoundly interesting introduction, with the whole\nmystery of the dream and of the subliminal world from which it\nemerges. This is something more than a poet's essay on dreammg :\nit is the work of a subtle thinker, equipped as the philosopher and the\npsychologist seldom are with a craftsman's skill in the expression of\nexact shades of meaning ; and it offers to the pedestrian student of\ndream-life a much wider outlook on the rich mental context of dream\nand fantasy than is usually within his range of vision.\nBut there is the poet's outlook, too, conveyed in this sensitive\nand lucid prose : the appreciation of a living event which allows its\nliving significance to resonate in the mind, and tlie rare ability to\n\f98 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1939\ndisplay a living process without man-handling it, or pulling it to bits.\nMr de la Mare remarks in one place that \" many lively and lovely\n'\nphenomena '\n(a frog or a humming-bird, for example) are unim-\nproved by dissection ; and even a chemical compound is not merely\nthe sum of its parts \". In psychical research, and in all the scientific\nprocedures by which we subject mental phenomena to cold analysis,\nwe are more or less dimly aware that we destroy some living signifi-\ncance with every neat stroke of the scalpel ; we are getting down to\nthe facts, but the facts are only the dead anatomy of the event. The\nstrict anatomy of events is none the less important ; after all, we\nhave to decide first and foremost whether their structiire is real or\nnot. But it is a good thing also to get away from the dissecting-\ntable and to regard living phenomena in terms of their life and move-\nment ; to borrow a poet's vision, if we have the luck to find it\navailable, and to dispel the intellectual illusion that a poet's view\nis all moonshine. The poet, with his perfected verbal craftsmanship,\nis the exact scientist of facts beyond intellectual statement ; and such\na book as this can help to restore the balance of scientific perception.\nMr de la Mare quotes a pretty example of psychological jargon\nabout dreams, and describes himself as \" palely wandering in the\nmists of this precise statement \" ; and he takes us out of the fog of\nabstract verbiage into regions of idea and expression where he is\ncapable of precise statement and the psychological technician is not.\nAdmittedly, I am applying the word \" precise \" here in its linguistic\nrather than its scientific sense ; but it is a benefit for scientific\nthinking to have the immense subliminal field of undefinable, but\npotent, \" atmosphere \" explored by a highly accurate expert in\natmosphere, who watches his use of words with that artistic rigour\nwhich is as stern as the scientific, and often much more efiicient as\nstatement. Others have paid tribute to the grace and distinction\nof Mr de la Mare's writing ; we can welcome the certainty and\npenetration with which he illuminates the more shadowy outlines\nof the stuff that we, and dreams, are made of. K. R.\nIkons and Oxen. By Philip Thornton. Collins. 12s. 6d. net.\nMr Philip Thornton, who recently gave a lecture in the Society's\nrooms on \" Vampirism and Fire Walking in the Balkans \", illus-\ntrated by his film, has presented his new book, called by the strange\ntitle Ikons and Oxen, to the Library.\nEveryone who is interested in the survival of primitive beliefs and\nritual will appreciate this book, which contains first-hand descrip-\ntions of curious and valuable folk lore, folk dancing, and strange\n\fJuly iy39 Reviews 99\ncustoms such as walking through fire. The author saw at Vulgari\nwomen carrying sacred ikons through a bonfire built up in the\nvillage square, the heat being so intense that it singed the clothes\nof anyone walking too near the edge. Yet Mr Thornton saw two\nwomen first stand on the grey heated ash and then\n\" three times round the fire they danced without so much as\na blister on their naked feet, not a thread singed in their trailing\nblack dresses ...\"\nHe was allowed to examine the women less than a minute after\ntheir emergence from the fire. The accoimt of this extraordinary\nritual is most vivid, and the ceremony seems to have been carefully\nobserved and the facts tested. There are many other interesting\nepisodes in the book, such as the funeral of a vampire victim and\nthe curious trances of the women of Duboka, all interspersed with\nlively descriptions of encounters with curious people, and battles\nwith over-curious insects.\nThere are hopes that Mr Thornton, when he returns, may follow\nup the lecture he gave to the S.P.R., and that his films may be\nshown with better success than on that occasion. Meanwhile, the\nbook is not only really entertaining, but Mr Thornton's theories\nabout the origin of these survivals from a primitive age. and their\npossible connection with modern times, are of considerable interest\nto students of psychical research. B. L.\nExperiments in Psychics. By F. W. Warrick. Rider & Co. 30s. net.\nMr Warrick deserves every commendation for the meticulous care\nwith which he has recorded his experiments in the most compre-\nhensive book that has been published on the question of spirit\nphotography. Apart from maintaining the supernormal nature of\nthese phenomena, the author does not suggest any reasons for their\noccurrence. He rightly remarks that trickery is ten thousand times\nmore likely than a supernormal explanation. His honesty in\nrecording gives many indications of such trickery ;\nyet he concludes\nthat it is \" unthinkable \".\nIn experiments with Mrs Deane, most of the freak markings\nobtained on photographic plates were such as could be produced\nby the surreptitious introduction of chemicals. On at least one\noccasion Mr Warrick discovered crystals on a cloth on Mrs Deane's\nlap and on the surface of a sensitive plate, which on analysis were\nfound to be ordinary amidol. Photographs were obtained showing\nwhat purported to be ectoplasm emanating from the mouth and\n\f100 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1939\nnostrils of the medium. The author remarks that this ectoplasm\n\"\nhas every appearance of cotton wool ; and after a later seance he\nactually found a lump of cotton wool in the medium's hair. Evi-\ndence was sought for supernormal radiation from the hands and feet\nof the medium on to various types of papers but, here again, most\nof the effects obtained were such as could be secured by the use of\nphotographic chemicals. An examination of the floor of the dark\nroom after one such experiment resulted in the discovery of a large\npool of stale amidol solution on each side of the position occupied\nby Mrs Deane's chair. In the experiments conducted with Mr Hope,\nthrough the help of a third party, Mr Warrick obtained on his\n\" untouched \" plates many traces of dirty finger markings and film\nabrasions, suggesting the use of a small instrument for the production\nof extras. It is amazing that the author appears to be in no way\nupset by all this evidence of human intervention. The chemicals\nand cotton wool, it is suggested, are \" apports \".\nThe details given certainly suggest that in the vast majority of\nthese experiments deception would be childishly easy. Mrs Deane,\nwho was an acute old lady, was never searched or examined, and\nMr Warrick was in most instances the only observer. Complicated\nexperiments took place in a room feebly illuminated by ruby lights.\nIt would be quite impossible for any single-handed experimenter to\nattend to all the details and at the same time to keep the medium\nunder constant observation. It is claimed as a remarkable thing\nthat on no single one of 300 photographic plates, carefully packed\nand sealed beforehand, did any faces appear as \" extras \" : it would\nhave been more worthy of remark if they had appeared under the\ngiven conditions. A careful perusal of Exjperiments in Psychics\nhas given added strength to my conviction that all these effects were\nproduced by very ordinary means, nor can I discover a single clear-\ncut case suggesting a supernormal explanation.\nFred Barlow.\nDeath Is Not The End.

Proceedings for July 1939, which states\nthat Mr Macaulay was introduced without any inquiry or remark by\nme. When writing that article I overlooked the fact that, during\nmy sister's personal control four weeks earlier, I had asked her to\ninform Mr Macaulay that \" his daughter wished to know if he had\nanything to say about her recent visit to Ireland and also that\nProfessor Lewis would appreciate a message from his first wife \".\nAlthough I know of no evidence to suggest that Eeda is aware of\nmatters spoken about while my father or sister control the medium,\nit is obvious that she might ascertain such information, whether by\nconversation with them or from the medium's mind. Hence nothing\ncan be based on the manner in which Mr Macaulay was introduced\non 22 January 1937, after seventeen weeks' silence.\n\fOctober 1939 A New Type of Proxy Case 103\nA NEW TYPE OF PEOXY CASE\nEvidential Messages given before it is known avho\nwill apply for them\nBy C. Drayton Thomas\nI. Aitken.\nAt a Leonard sitting on 28 October 1938, my regular communi-\ncators inquired if I had recently received a letter from a middle aged\nman about his son. As I had not received any such letter they pro-\nceeded to give some particulars and I promised to keep the matter\nin mind and await results.\nIn less than two weeks a letter arrived which seemed to meet the\ncase. In correspondence with its writer the following facts emerged ;\nthey are here placed for comparison under items given at the sitting.\n1. \/ am to expect a letter from a father about his son. Such a letter\nxeached me and it was dated eleven days after this sitting. The writer,\nMr Lionel G. Aitken, is a member of the S.P.R. He tells me that he\nfirst thought of writing after hearing me speak at a Queen's Hall\nmeeting on 9 October, which was three weeks before this sitting.\nOne sentence of that letter reads,\n'\n' Not very long ago I lost a son,\na splendid young man, full of the joy of life and success.\" After\nreference to certain London mediums it continues, \" I think on the\nwhole that we have been most fortunate in the evidential nature of\nthe messages received.\" Finally my ad^^ce was asked about other\nmediums, but no word to suggest that I might possibly obtain a\nmessage for him through Mrs Leonard.\nOn my inquiring when Mr Aitken had first thought of writing he\nreplied, \" I don't think I had thought of mentioning my case to you\nand asking for advice until I actually wrote the letter. I merely\nintended to thank you for your address. It appears that you had\nnews of something I was going to write days before I wrote it or had\nconsciously thought of it.\"\n2. The father is middle aged. This is correct.\n3. An accident case. This also is correct.\n4. Connected with a motor car. Mr Aitken writes, \" Not a motor\ncar accident exactly.\"\n5. The young man was Idlled outright or very nearly so. He was\nkilled outright.\n6. Morton or a like-sounding name ; this father once lived, near\n-where you lived. In correspondence about this statement I learnt\nthat Mr Aitken had resided at the village of Norton and that his son\nwas born there and had been familiar with all the neighbourhood.\n\f104 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October igs^'\nNorton is but one and a half miles from Baldock where I had lived\nwith my parents in 1876-8. Is it too much to suppose that Feda'a\n\" Morton \" was misheard by her for Norton?\n7. Another vmne like Char\u2014 is given. This was unsatisfactory,\njust possibly an attempt for Charles, the Christian name of Mr\nAitken's friend killed at Gallipoli.\nThe above derives special significance from the facts :\n(a) I had not heard of this family.\n(b) There had been no intercourse between them and Mrs Leonard.\n(c) The son had previously proved himself an able communicator.\n(d) At four later Leonard sittings he gave additional evidences of\nhis identity, one of these being a group of connected facts\nimknown to his father but common knowledge to the\ndeceased and his surviving brother.\nWhence came the information that Mr Aitken and I had lived in\nthe same locality? On my writing to ask for a list of his places of\nresidence he named several and added that Hertfordshire seemed\nthe most likely to be the one intended. On our discovering that\nBaldock and Norton (both in Hertfordshire) met the case, I pointed\nout that my former residence at Baldock was mentioned in two of\nmy books and inquired what had led him to suppose that Hertford-\nshire was meant. He wrote in reply, \" I had read your book Life\nBeyond Death with Evidence, and therefore was unconsciously aware\nbefore the first message came through that we both had lived at or\nnear Baldock. But my conscious reason for saying in my second\nletter that I suspected the place would be in Hertfordshire was that\nmy son's first and depest memories were of that locality and as I\nwas sure that he was behind the messages I natiirally thought of\nplaces connected with him \".\nIt will be admitted that in this case the link between me and the\n(expected) applicant was exceedingly tenuous, if indeed it can be\nsaid to have even existed.\nThe crucial dates are : 9 Octoljer, Mr Aitken hears me speak at\na public service. 28 October, the message given at my sitting.\n8 November, Mr Aitken writes his letter.\nThose who incline to the universal telepathy hypothesis will\nsuggest that the messages originated with Mr Aitken. But this\nwould imply that the medium tapped Mr Aitken's memory before\neither she or I were aware of his existence and, more incredible still,\nthat she divined a purpose of which he remained entirely unaware\nuntil he was in the act of writing to thank me for remarks he heard\nme make in public.\n\fOctober 1939 A New Type of Proxy Case 105\nII. Netherton.\nAt a Leonard sitting on 17 March 1939, I received a group of\nmessages with this introduction :\nFeda : Will you keep a look out for a letter asking you about\na ladv, no one we have had, a new one. I think that someone\nhas written or is writing to ask if you can help about her. The\none she's expecting to write to you is a man, and she at once\ngives me rather a connection, as if they had some rather close\nconnection with churches in general in some way.\nC. D. T. : Does the lady say that she knows me?\nFeda : Yes, she does.\nEvidential references now followed and the communication ended\nthus :\nC. D. T. : Won't it be a pity, Feda, if after taking all this\ntrouble I don't get any inquiry!\nFeda : I think you will and soon. I have got quite a lot and\nI don't think I can get any more ; it's enough for you to be able\nto place her. Your sister says, \" Of course it is nice to have as\nmuch as you can before you know who it is.\" The lady seems\nsatisfied and says, \" I'll see what I can do.\"\nTen days later I received a letter, dated 25 March, from Mr C. G.\nNetherton of Bournemouth. It stated that he had just read one of\nmy books and asked if I were son of the Rev. Drayton Thomas whose\nChurch at Ramsgate he used to attend. He also mentioned that his\nwife died two years back.\nIn my reply, enclosing a full record of this sitting, I asked at what\ndate he had decided to write to me. He replied that it was a day or\nso before he actually wrote the letter, but that the idea of doing so\nhad been in his mind since seeing a letter of mine in the Methodist\nRecorder of 2 March on the reality and religious value of communi-\ncation with the departed.\nWhen later I met Mr Netherton and asked if he had expected to\nreceive a message from his wife as a result of writing to me, his reply\nwas that he had no such expectation ; on second thoughts he ad-\nmitted that perhaps some such idea was at back of his mind. I\nascertained that Mr Netherton had not known or corresponded with\n]\\Irs Leonard.\nOn checking the evidential items of this first sitting we found that\n23 out of 31 were correct, a 70 per cent, success. Further evidence\ngiven at subsequent sittings added to the certainty of the communi-\ncator's identity. Mr Netherton informs me that his wife was a fixm\n\flOG Journal of Sociehj for Psychical Research October 193^\nbeliever in the possibility of communication with departed friends.\nWas she, dm'ing the interval between my sitting and his letter, im-\npressing him to Avrite? It is clear that, had he not written, all the\nmessages given on 17 March would have been waste of time.\nThe crucial dates are : My letter to the Press on 2 March. The\nsitting of 17 March. Mr Netherton's first letter to me on 25 March.\nWas there any link between the Nethertons and me? If it\nexisted the hint lay in two remarks at the beginning of the sitting,\n(a)\n'\nSome rather close connection with Churches.' (6)\n\" The lady\nknew me.\" Now I find that Mr Netherton is a Methodist Lay\nPreacher and that during the period 1901-3 he and his wife attended\nmy father's Church at Ramsgate. On my visits home in those years\nthe Nethertons would have seen me and known that I was the\nminister's son. I have no recollection of them.\nCan it be supposed that this constituted a mental link between\nMr Netherton and me? He only guessed my relationship with the\nminister of the Ramsgate Church in 1901-3 and wrote for information\non that point. True he had read something from my pen, but if that\nconstitutes an available link for transmitting the reader's memories\nto Mrs Leonard or to me, then I ought to be having thousands of\ncases like the above.\nCORRESPONDENCE\nThe Position of Psychical Research\nTo the Editor of The Journal\nSir,\u2014The pubHcation of the series of small books under the\nheading Psychical Experiences and some of the review^s of these books\nin the public press afford a good opportunity of observing how-\npsychical research, as a whole, is regarded by critics who approach\nit from opposite angles, from the angle of organised science, and\nfrom that of organised spiritualism.\nIn the issue of Nature for the 11 February 1939 there is a full page\nreview of the four first volmnes of the series (Mrs Richmond's\n\" Evidence of Purpose \", Mr Saltmarsh's \" Foreknowledge \", Mr\nCuddon's \" Hypnosis \" and my own \" Ghosts and Apparitions \")\nand also of Mr Tyrrell's book, \" Science and Psychical Phenomena \".\nIn several respects the review is a favourable one, and it may be\nhoped that many scientists at present uninterested in the subject\nmay be encouraged by it to give it their attention. Mr Tyrrell's book\nis well described as \" one of the best surveys so far pubhshed \", \" a\npersuasive and thought-provoking volume \", and of the other\n\fOctober 1939 Correspondefice 107\nvolumes it is said that \" the student who wishes to become ac-\nquainted with the best cases the Society has to offer cannot do\nbetter than read these books, and then, if he wishes, he can go back\nto the original sources for additional information \".\nThese commendatory remarks, which are welcome in a paper of\nNature's standing among scientists, are however followed by a some-\nwhat double-edged paragraph which begins as follows : \"It can\nscarcely be denied that, viewed as attempts to claim scientific recog-\nnition, these volumes are of great interest. To one wholly untrained\nin psychical research and with no knowledge of what lies behind\nmuch of the imj^ressive fa\u00a7ade, the effect must be considerable.\nOnly careful analysis and years of experience wiU weaken that\neffect, for it is but here and there that the authors under review cite\ncases as good, which are so clearly full of flaws that suspicion of\ntheir critical faculties is aroused.\" The implications of these\nsentences are that the phenomena discussed in these books have\n\" an impressive fagade \" but no sound foundations, and that the\nreviewer, who does not give his name or initials, is in a position,\nfrom his own superior knowledge of psychical research, to exjjose\nthe hoUowness of the fagade. It is to be noted that he is not content\nwith speaking of the soUdity of the structure as doubtful : he\nassumes that \" careful analysis and years of experience will weaken\n\"\nthe impression created by a first reading of the book. His condes-\ncending remark that \" it is but here and there that the authors under\nreview cite cases as good, which are so clearly fuU of flaws that\nsuspicion of their critical faculties is aroused \" can carry no weight\nwithout specific mention of the cases open to this criticism ; such a\nsentence is in fact merely bad reviewing.\nThe criticism about \" the impressive fagade \" conveys a partial\ntruth, and deserves further consideration. It would be generally\nagreed among our members, and not least among the authors of the\nbooks under review, that many much advertised psychic pheno-\nmena will not stand close scrutiny. Had the reviewer confined his\ncriticism to these, no objection could have been taken. But the\ntypes of phenomena, to which this criticism can fairly be applied,\nare hardly mentioned in these books. There is therefore a risk lest\nthe guileless scientist, who is conscious of his own ignorance of\npsychical research, may be misled by a reviewer, who professes to\nknow all about it, into supposing that the phenomena on which Mr\nTyrrell and the authors of Messrs Bell's series dwell are equally\nshoddy, although it is the general opinion of intelligent persons who\nhave studied the matter that they rest for the most part on sound\nfoundations.\n\f108 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1939\nIt would also have been well if the reader of Nature had been\nwarned that some of the phenomena treated in these books are the\nsubject of highly specialised investigation, so that unless the un-\nnamed reviewer belongs (as I am certain he does not) to the very\nsmall number of specialists, his claim to set the authors of these\nbooks right has about as much justification as would attach to a\nclaim on my part to instruct Professor Julian Huxley in the rearing\nof Giant Pandas in captivity.\nTo turn now to the criticisms from the angle of spiritualism, the\nbooks of Messrs Bell's series have been reviewed by Light as they\nappeared, and in addition to the reviews several issues of that paper\nhave contained articles and correspondence on them.\nIt is a misfortune for all concerned that the reviewer seems some-\ntimes to have been so much irritated by the books as to be unable\nto deal with them with ordinary accuracy. I may perhaps be\nallowed to mention that my own book on \" Ghosts and Apparitions\n\"\nwas attributed to Mr Saltmarsh, which was of course a great compli-\nment to myself ; later on Mr Saltmarsh very properly received from\nthe reviewer an apology for this horrible imputation. In another\ninstance, Mr Richmond's discussion of the \" Lethe Case \" in his\n\" Evidence of Identity \", the reviewer seems to have supposed that\nMr Piddington, whom Mr Richmond quotes, accepted telepathy\nbetween the living as a sufficient explanation of the incident,\nwhereas it is perfectly clear from Mr Richmond's discussion of the\ncase that Mr Piddington, after full discussion of that explanation,\ndefinitely rejected it.\nThe inaccuracies of a single reviewer would not, however, be\nworth attention in our Journal, if it were not for the fact that it\nis obvious that the reviewer, and many of the readers of Light\nwith him, are under a very curious misapprehension as to the attitude\nof our Society to telepathy and, in particular, as to the bearing of\ntelepathy on the problem of survival and communication.\nThe nature of the misapprehension may be conveniently illus-\ntrated by a few short quotations from Light. The review of\nMr Richmond's \" Evidence of Identity \" in the issue of the 15 June\nwas headed \" The Problem of Identity : Telepathy as a '\nCity of\nRefuge ' for timid Psychical Researchers \", and contains the\nfollowing passage\n:\n\" This matter of telepathy, for instance? Has the Society\nany corporate conviction about it? Is it or is it not?\nOne knows many members of the Society who regard tele-\npathy with undisguised contempt, and they certainly appear\n\fOCTOBEK 1939 Correspondence 109\nto consider themselves to be in accord with the majority of\nmembers.\nTo that, of course, one could offer no objection ;\nindeed, one\nis very glad to be rid of telepathy being treated as a city of\nrefuge in psychic matters.\nBut, in that case, telepathy must not be used, as Mr Rich-\nmond uses it, as such a city when the Researcher is hard\npressed by a Spiritualist pursuer.\"\nIn the issue of the 22 June there is a reply from Mr Richmond\ncontaining the following passage :\n\" Concerning telepathy, he [the reviewer] asks :\n'\nHas the\nSociety (the S.P.R.) any corporate conviction about it?\n'\nWithout claiming to speak for the Society, let me point to\np. 106 in my book, where I have remarked of Psychical Re-\nsearch in general :\n'\nIt can hardly be said too often that\nscientific method is not devised to provide or to support con-\nvictions. It is devised to examine evidence. ... It has to\nleave out no explanation which is possible '.\"\nTo which the reviewer replied in the same issue :\n\" In spite of Mr Richmond's letter, I would still ask :\n'\nHas\nthe Society (the S.P.R.) any corporate conviction about tele-\npathy '?\n\"\nMr Richmond's material is mostly selected from its Pro-\nceedings, and since, in them, telepathy is frequently proposed\nas an explanation, surely one is entitled to enquire if the\nSociety believes in its own answers, especially since so many of\nits members obviously do not?\n\"\nTo members of our Society, accustomed as we are to breathing an\natmosphere of free discussion and friendly difference of opinion, it\nmay seem extraordinary that any reviewer who has reviewed several\nbooks pubhshed by members of the Society, and therefore probably\nread at least considerable portions of them, should be unaware that\nexpression of corporate opinion is the very last thing which our\nSociety desires or ought to desire. I do not know whether the\nastronomers, or the biologists, or the physicists have ever expressed\ncorporate opinions on the theories of Copernicus, Darwin or Ein-\nstein, but it is clear that any Society enquiring into a subject with\nas short a history as organised psychical research has, would lose\nall title to the term research if it expressed a corporate opinion on\nany of the questions it investigates, or required from its members the\nacceptance of any particular opinion regarding them. Obviously,\nhowever, many spirituaUsts suppose that the amount of attention\n\f110 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 193&\nthat our Society has always devoted to the question of telepathy is\nindicative of a desire on the part of the leading members of the\nSociety to put it up as a plausible defence against belief in spiri-\ntualism.\nAs a plain matter of history this is of course absurd. Among the\npioneers of the Society none did more to press the case for telepathy\nthan Sir William Barrett and F. W. H. Myers, both convinced\nbelievers in survival and communication. Again, Mrs Sidgwick's\nlife-long study of telepathy and belief in it, did not prevent her\nmaking on the occasion of the Society's Jubilee her memorable\ndeclaration :\n\" that, upon the evidence before her, she herself is a\nfirm believer both in survival and in the reality of communication\nbetween the living and the dead.\" The same opinion has been held\nand expressed by many other members of the Society.\nIt will probably seem to most of our members, as it certainly\nseemed to Myers and Mrs Sidgwick, impossible to examine the\nproblem of survival and communication to any purpose without a\nprevious examination, as full as conditions will permit, of the\nquestion of telepathy. It should be remembered that Myers's well-\nknown definition of telepathy, \" the communication of impressions\nof any kind from one mind to another, independently of the recog-\nnised channels of sense \", is framed in such a way as to include\ncommunication from a discarnate mind to the mind of a living\nperson. Unfortunately, for the sake of brevity the word \" tele-\npathy \" is sometimes used by writers to mean \" telepathy between\nthe living \", and this misuse of the word has given rise to a false\nopposition between telepathy and survival.\nIt seems to me extremely difi&cult to examine the whole range of\nthe mental phenomena of psychical research (including veridical\ndreams and hallucinations, death apparitions, experimental tele-\npathy, automatic writing, trance mediumship) without reaching\nthe conclusion that the study of any one type of phenomenon\nwithin this group is of the greatest assistance in studying all the\nother types, and moreover that there is some similarity, if not com-\nplete unity, of mental process involved in them all. The habit of\nregarding these phenomena as to this extent at least forming a\nnatural group, though a commonplace in our Society, seems to be\nall too rare outside our own membership.\nOpinions within the Society have always widely differed, as in\nthe present state of our knowledge it is right that they should, as to\nthe explanation of these phenomena. A small section declines to\nsee in them the operation of any but normal and recognised causes,\nand rejects both the telepathic and survivalistic hypotheses.\n\fOctober 1939 Correspondence 111\nAnother section follows Podmore in accepting telepathy and reject-\ning survival ; this section is probably a good deal larger than the\nfirst and can support its position by arguments which no believer\nin survival can afford to despise or neglect. The main argument of\nthis section might perhaps be summarized as follows :\n(1) There is\na great deal more evidence for telepathy than for survival. (2) The\n''\nantecedent improbability \" of telepathy is nothing like as great as\nthe \" antecedent improbability \" of survival. (3) Where the evi-\ndence can equally well be interpreted either on the hypothesis of\ntelepathy from the living or of communication from a discarnate\nmind, preference should be given to the former.\nThese three propositions would, I suppose, be accepted by most\nof the members of the Society who accept survival, a section which\nhas certainly not been without influence. It is in the apphcation of\nthese propositions that the survivalists would part company with\nthe followers of Podmore. Until the possibility of telepathy between\nthe living has been examined in detail, in each particular instance,\nas e.g. Mr Piddington discussed it in the \" Lethe Case \", arguments\nof a survivalistic tendency fail to carry conviction.\nBy \" possibility \" I do not mean what is possible on some fan-\ntastic exaggeration of the scope of telepathy between the living, but\nwhat may reasonably be inferred as possible from the relevant evi-\ndence, spontaneous and experimental.\nDifferent types of evidence appeal with different degrees of\ncogency to different minds, and it would be unreasonable to claim\nthat the method by which in our Proceedings and Journal the\nproblem of survival has usually been approached is the only possible\none. If, however, I may be allowed to express my own personal\nopinion for what it is worth, it is that if one were to eliminate all the\nwork done by members of the Society, and by others who have\nworked on similar hnes, in conducting prolonged investigations both\nof spontaneous and of experimental telepathy, and in examining all\nostensible communications from the dead with a view to ascer-\ntaining how far they could reasonably be explained by telepathy\nbetween the living, the argument for communication from the dead,\nif not completely destroyed, would be most gravely impaired.\nFrom whatever angle therefore the problems of psychical research\nare regarded it would appear that more attention, rather than less,\nshould be paid to telepathy, and that more investigation of it, both\nquantitative and qualitative, is required.\nYours, etc.,\nW. H. Salter.\n\f112 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1939\n\" Experiments in Psychics\n\"\nSir,\u2014Mr Fred Barlow's article on my book Experiments in\nPsychics in the S.P.R. Journal of July last, pj). 99-100, can hardly\nbe called a review ; Mr Barlow's article is that of an opposing\ncounsel. His adverse attitude towards Mr Hope and Mrs Deane is\nclearly shown in the S.P.R. Proceedings of March 1933.\nA book by a member of the S.P.R. of many years' standing, of\n400 pages double crown 8vo with 650 illustrations, reporting many\nyears of systematic investigation, surely deserves a review of such\na character that his fellow-members might learn the main contents\nof it and be influenced thereby to examine it and when the oppor-\ntunity arises repeat his experiments.\nThe most important result of my investigation (chap, vii of the\nbook), namely, the discovery that the medium for psychic photo-\ngraphy, Mrs Deane, was also a medium for Direct Writing, is not\nmentioned at all by Mr Barlow.\nIn my humble opinion the methods of experimentation and the\nreally amazing results obtained, recorded in that chapter, are of the\nutmost importance to students of psychic science, and it is dis-\ncouraging that the attention of his fellow-members should not be\ncalled to them. The author cannot be accused of expecting any\nmonetary reward for such work.\nI fear that many readers of Mr Barlow's article may not appreciate\nmy impartiality and may regard me as one with a \" desire to be-\nlieve \" and hence may consider my book not worth reading. Among\nremarks which have that tendency is the statement that I wrote\nI considered trickery \" unthinkable \" ; should Mr Barlow have\nomitted the words I wrote connected with the word unthinkable,\nviz. :\n\" trickery over a period of twenty-seven years without detec-\ntion in the very act \"? Even Mr Harry Price said as much. In\nmy book I devoted a page or two to the subject of trickery by\nmediums for physical effects.\nAgain Mr Barlow writes :\n\" It is amazing that the author appears\nto be in no way '\nupset ' by all this evidence of human interven-\ntion.\" I may indeed have been upset but my reading had taught\nme that most, if not all, mediums for physical phenomena use\nmundane means if not prevented from so doing.\nHe criticized my \" claiming \" it as a \" remarkable \" thing that\non none of 300 plates did any face appear as Extra. In the sense\nin which I used the word, it is \" a remarkable thing \", that is to say,\n\" worthy of remark \", a word used to call the reader's attention\nto such unusual absence of faces with Mrs Deane.\n\fOctober 1939 Correspondence 113\nAs regards my mentioning the possibility of apportage being a\nfactor in inexplicable happenings : even the great Schrenck-Notzing\ndeigned to suggest that. What other theory can one put forward\nfor marks appearing on an inside page of a packet of clean sheets\nof paper and this more than once ?\nOf course I do not agree with the sweeping conclusion Mr Barlow\ndraws from my many experiments nor that in the vast majority of\nthem deception would be \" childishly \" easy. He says \" compli-\ncated \" experiments took place. Not many of my experiments were\n\" compHcated \". Were there no others? Is it a compUcated experi-\nment to have the medium hold a block or pile of plain paper between\nher hands and suggest that a word or letter \" thought of by me \"\nshould appear on an inside page ?\nI am afraid that Mr Barlow tended to overlook the \" pros \" while\nconcentrating on the ''\ncons \".\nYours faithfully, F. W. Warrick.\nMr Barlow writes : I should be sorry if my brief remarks led\nanyone to consider Mr Warrick's book not worth reading, as the\npatient research work he has carried out over a long period of time\nis invaluable. The exigences of space, unfortunately, render it im-\npossible to enter into detailed support of my views, nor do I flatter\nmyself that my personal opinions will coincide with those of the\nmajority of people who I trust will read this book and form their\nown conclusions.\nREVIEWS\nApparitions and Haunted Houses : A Survey of Evidence.

(Bulletin III,\nThe Dr. William Bernard Johnston Foundation for Biophysical\nResearch, Reno, Nevada.) By R. A. Waters, Sc.D., and\nWilliam B. Johnston, M.D.\nThe authors have set themselves the task of trying to detect by\n\u2022experiment some entity separating itself from an organism, such as\na. mouse, at the time of death. They describe experiments made\nin a Wilson cloud chamber to look for the formation, subsequent to\ndeath, in the surrounding space, of nuclei capable of acting as centres\nof condensation for water drops. They do find evidence of such\nnuclei, but since nuclei are known to be formed in various ordinary\nchemical actions where hfe is not concerned, it would seem, as the\nauthors indicate, that there is a good deal to be done before such\nphenomena can be shown to have any special psychical or even\nbiological significance. R.\nLaboratory Investigations into Psychic Phenomena. By Hebkward\nCarrington. Rider & Co. 12s. 6d. net.\nThis is a compilation which must have necessitated a considerable\nexpenditure of time and money, the former testified to by the copious\nand careful references, lists (including one giving the names of 103\ninvestigators into the subject), indices, appendices, etc. ; the latter\nby 34 excellent photographs obtained by the author while working\nunder the auspices of the American Psychical Institute, as Director.\nIn the introduction the desirability of studying \" strange mani-\nfestations \" by laboratory methods is stressed, and these, as is\ncustomary, are divided into \" the physical \" and \" the mental \"\n;\nboth are supposed to depend upon a definite mechanism,, and to\noccur in accordance with definite laws within their own sphere.\nThe introduction is followed by a history, which occupies more\nthan one third of the entire volume : in this are summarised briefly\ninvestigations of (a) alleged physical mediums and {b) alleged strange\nmanifestations not requiring the presence of a medium. The\nremainder of the book is a description of endeavours on the part of\nthe author to obtain (b), for the most part without success. At the\n\fOctober 1939 Reviews 115\nsame time it gives a sad account of well meant, but inexpert, in-\nvestigations of others who have tested such devices as \" The\nCylinders of Malta \", \" The Dynamistograph \", Dr. Russ's Eye\nMachine \", \" Rutot's Triangles \" and the effect of \" Will Power \" on\ngalvanometer readings.\nIt would seem that the main object of Mr Carrington's book is to\npoint out that adequate tests are necessary before one can place\nreliance on the face value of psychic claims. While long descrip-\ntions of abortive experiments make but sorry reading, the author's\nprecepts, on numerous occasions, bring joy and laughter. Let me\nshare with you one of his gems of pure thought (p. 184, under\n\" Conclusions \") :\n\" Any device which can, and will, under normal\nworking conditions, give both positive and negative results, during\nthe same observation, is unreliable and unfit for the study of\nsupernormal phenomena.\nIn his investigations the author has made considerable use of\nsimple electrical apparatus ; but he is, apparently, unfamiliar with\nthe elementary theory of electro-magnetic induction, which he seems\nto have mixed up with electro-static induction. On page 209 he\nsays \" It is a well-known fact that certain materials, when in close\nproximity to an electrical field, will become electrified by induction.\nThis is the principle of the ordinary transformer with which X-ray\nworkers are so familiar \". He then goes on to describe an induction\ncoil, but he leaves out the really important point, the dependence\nof the current in the secondary coil on the rate of change of the\nprimary current.\nThe author's conclusions would indeed appear to accord with\ncommon experience if put in the following words, viz., \" strange\nmanifestations \" do not take place in laboratory experiments, unless\nsome very strange person is present. But why write a book about\nit? C. C. L. G.\nPsychic Science and Survival. By Hereward Carrington. Two\nWorlds Pubhshing Co. Ltd. 2s. 6d. net.\nThis little volume of 90 pages is described as \" An Essay in\nPsychical Research \"'.\nIt appears to be a clear and honest account\nof the author's views on the subject, in the expression of which he\nshows real knowledge of its literature, and presents it in a condensed,\nthough somewhat journahstic style. Pages 27 to 32 are auto-\nbiographical ; on page 31 he says \" As a result of my investigations,\nhowever, I have become quite convinced that psychical phenomena\nare for the most part real\u2014that is, they are genuinely supernormal\n\f116 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1939\nin. character\u2014and that there is a superphysical world of some sort\nin which we are all immersed, and of which we constitute a part \".\nApart from what is auto-biographical, this book does not contain\nanything new.

The last\ncalled \" St Paul at the Journey's End \" describes his trial and\nexecution and the death of Nero. It will be seen that there is no\nlack of material of great dramatic interest. To what extent the\nbook reveals evidence of knowledge transcending Miss Cummins's\nnormal knowledge is one that only a scholar who had specialised in\nthe history of the Early Church could be expected to answer. The\nordinary layman cannot usefully pronounce an opinion as to how\nfar the events described in this book (leaving out of account those\nwhich are narrated in the New Testament), are in accordance with\nthe results of historical research, and, to the extent to which they\nare in accordance, how far the facts are likely to have been accessible\nto Miss Cummins.

Although, as a Jesuit Father, he could not attend seances,\nand could only avail himself of the less direct method of approach to\npsychic phenomena through reports furnished by others, his careful\nreading of the literature of the subject, his scholarly knowledge of\napparently kindred phenomena in earlier times, and his keen critical\ngifts combined to place him in the front rank of contemporary\nstudents of psychical research. He had, indeed, what is one of the\nchief requisites of a pisychical researcher, a keen eye for the evi-\ndentially strong or weak points in a narrative of unusual occurrences,\nand brought his great historical knowledge of, e.g., medieval instances\nof stigmatisation and levitation to bear on the analysis of modern\nevidence for similar phenomena. Although in the pubUc mind\npsychical research is confused with spiritualism, or at any rate is\nsupposed to cover much the same ground, it is to a large extent con-\ncerned with problems of psychology which have, for good reasons or\nbad, been neglected by academic psychologists. In the experiments\nwhich the Society conducted into this province of its subject. Father\nThurston took an active part.\nHe twice read papers to the Society, once in 1921, on The Pheno-\nmena of Stigmatisation (published in S.P.R. Proceedings, vol. XXXII)\nand the other, in 1932, on So^ne Neglected Types of Evidence in\nPsychical Research, in which he maintained that some of the criti-\ncisms directed against the phenomena of D. D. Home were un-\nfounded. He contributed several letters and articles to the Society's\nJournal, and was a frequent attendant at its meetings. Father\nThurston also contributed numerous articles on Spiritualism and\nPsychical Research to The Month: a series of these were published\nin book-form in 1933 under the title, The Church and Spiritualism.\nThe Society for Psychical Research comprehends many shades of\nopinion from outright Spiritualism to complete disbelief in the\nsupernormal in any shape or form. Not many, perhaps, of his\nfellow members shared Father Thurston's own standpoint, but there\nis none, however wide the difference in opinion, who will not deplore\nthe loss of so courteous and learned a colleague.\n\fNov.-Dec. 1939 Obituary 119\nDAVID GOW\nBy the Eev. C. Drayton Thomas\nIt was in 1917 that I made the acquaintance of Mr Gow. I was\nwishing to add knowledge of contemporary Spiritualism to what I\nhad learnt of Psychical Research in a seventeen years' membership\noftheS.P.R. David Gow soon proved himself a helpful friend. The\nfact that he was conversant with S.P.R. methods and literature gave\nme the more confidence in his judgment on matters of which I then had\nlittle personal knowledge. He was as patient with mental hesita-\ntions as he was tactful with the over credulous, yet withal humorous,\nwhimsical and very human. Small and frail in body, he was strongly\nalert in mind. To philosophical insight and artistic taste he added\nextensive acquaintance with the history of psychical investigation\nand a shrewd estimate of evidence. He was eminently successful in\nkeeping the paper Light on a high grade of efficiency during his long\nyears of editorship. His wisdom was shown by what he wrote, the\nclass of contribution he accepted, and also by what he excluded\nfrom the paper. With a fine sense of discrimination he realised just\nwhat readers needed to know and how they should be shepherded\npast distracting side-issues which lead nowhere. A long and intimate\nassociation with Fleet Street had qualified him for effectively super-\nvising all work connected with the weekly issue of his paper. Taking\nnothing for granted and refusing to spare himself he perused each\ncolumn before it went to press. Long years of close apj)lication,\ndespite increasing physical weakness, overtaxed his strength and\nfinally forced him to a comparatively premature retirement. To so\nalert a mind this was a severe trial, but he met it with philosophic\nresignation. Those who had the privilege of conversations in his\noffice will recall with pleasure how readily he would illumine from\nhis store of experience and literary knowledge a wide range of topics.\nHumour and the lighter touch alternated with deep thought and\ndiscerning judgment. He was as kindly and tactful with colleagues\nas with the stream of inquirers invading his office.\nIt was largely due to David Gow's foresight and efforts that the\nLondon Spirituahst Association was able to obtain the freehold\npremises in Queensberry Place which it now enjoys.\n\" No work begim on earth shall end with death \" ;\none pictures\nthe enthusiasm with which D.G. (as his friends affectionately called\nhim) is now learning to share the varied activities of the Great\nBeyond where sterUng qualities matured on earth find wider scope.\n\f120 Journal of Society for PsycJdcal Research Nov.-Dec. 1939\nA NEW TYPE OF PROXY CASE\nDetails concerning the \" Aitken \" episode\nIn our last issue (October 1939, p. 103), Mr Drayton Thomas\ndescribed two cases in which the arrival of letters was predicted,\nand facts were given, at Leonard sittings, concerning communicators\nand their relatives of whom at the time Mr Thomas knew nothing.\nSubsequently, Mr Thomas received letters from two relatives of\ndeceased persons, and facts emerged wliich appeared to show con-\nsiderable relevance to details given at the sittings.\nIt is clear that this evidence is important, whether it is interpreted\nas evidence of communication or of the possibilities of unconscious\ntelepathy between the living. Critical readers will have wished to\nknow, among other things, what is the nature and strength of the\nevidence of identity which came to light when the communications\nwere investigated by Mr Thomas. With regard to the first of the\ntwo communicators, Mr Thomas wrote (Journal, Oct. 1939, p. 104) :\n\" At four later Leonard sittings he gave additional evidences of\nhis identity, one of these being a group of connected facts unknown\nto his father but common knowledge to the deceased and his sur-\nviving brother.\"\nThis, it will be seen, is of the nature of a proxy case within a proxy\ncase, if facts unknown to the father (he having proved to be Mr\nThomas's predicted correspondent) were produced at Leonard\nsittings after the predicted letter from the father had reached Mr\nThomas.\nThe father in question\u2014Mr L. G. Aitken, who is a Member of\nthe S.P.R.\u2014wrote spontaneously to the Journal, to corroborate Mr\nThomas's account, as follows :\n\" As one of the principals in the Leonard-Aitken proxy case\nreported by Mr Drayton Thomas in the Journal for October, may T\ncorroborate and amplify it somewhat. On October 9th, 1938, I\nheard Mr Drayton Thomas give an address at the Queen's Hall,\nwhich so pleased me that I formed the intention of writing to con-\ngratulate him ; but being a born procrastinator it was not till the 8th\nof Nov. that I actually wrote\u2014mentioning at the end of the letter\nmy own case and asking for advice. To my surprise in Mr Drayton\nThomas's reply was enclosed a copy of part of the script of a sitting\nhe had had with Mrs Leonard on Oct. 28th, 1938, in which he was\ntold to expect a letter from a man\u2014a middle-aged man\u2014who had\nlost a son\u2014in an accident, probably a motor-car\u2014that the son had\nbeen killed outright\u2014the name Morton or a lilvc sounding one was\n\fNov.-Dec. 1939 A New Type of Proxy Case 121\ngiven and the statement that this man had hved near where Mr\nDrayton Thomas lived. The facts were\u2014I am a middle-aged man\n\u2014\nI had lost a son in an Air Force accident in Dec. 1937\u2014he was killed\noutright\u2014and I had lived in the village of Norton in Hertfordshire\nfrom about 1910-22, very near which Mr Drayton Thomas had\nlived from 1876-8.\n\" I had never met or written to Mr Drayton Thomas at the time\nof this sitting, nor had I ever had any contact of any kind with Mrs\nLeonard. They were both quite unaware of my existence, but I was\naware of theirs.\n\" On the hypothesis of telepathy from the living, I must be sup-\nposed to have sent a thought message to Mr Drayton Thomas\n\u2014\nprobably after hearing him speak on the 9th\u2014when my intention\nwas strongest ; a message containing some facts about myself.\nThis message, presumably, '\nstuck '\nto Mr Drayton Thomas, and\non the 28th Oct was picked out and decoded by Mrs Leonard in\ntrance. Now Mr Thomas by his public addresses and books must\nstimulate many hundreds of people to send thought messages to\nhim, and, presumably, these also stick but remain unknown to Mr\nDrayton Thomas. Who selected this particular message for decod-\ning and why?\n\" Later on, Mr Drayton Thomas sent me further extracts from\nrecords of Leonard sittings containing amongst much evidential\nmatter, a group of facts which I could make little of ; but which my\nson, on seeing, recognised at once as a message concerning a common\nfriend of his and my dead son's who had been killed some months\nlater, and of whose existence I had never heard.\n\" Here there seemed to be a further intention to give a message for\nsomeone of whose existence Mr Drayton Thomas and Mrs Leonard\nwere unaware.\n\" In this latter case\u2014my son tells me he had deliberately asked\nhis dead brother to try and get a message concerning this friend\nthrough some medium to me ; that he felt sure at the time that his\nbrother had got the message, and that he was not very surprised to\nsee it come through almost exactly as he had expected, including a\nvery near shot at the name, in the Leonard script.\n\" I think there is here evidence of a successful experiment to force\na further stretching of the universal telepathic hypothesis to the\nextent that its already astonishing elasticity becomes an '\nante-\ncedent improbability '.\nL. G. AlTKEN.\"\nBeing invited to send evidential details of the episode here\n\f122 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Nov.-Dec. 1939\ndescribed, Mr Aitken furnished the following facts and corrobora-\ntion :\n\" In Mr Drayton Thomas's sitting of Jan. 20th, 1939, Feda says :\n'\nThere was somebody else he was very interested in, that perhaps\nyou don't know ... a name that starts with the letter B, and I\nthink there is an R in it . . . it's not a long name\u2014very much linked\nwith him ... it might be a Mr. BRICK. ... I feel this is something\nyou could use for building, and is a name much connected with this\nboy and his interests.'\n\" In Mr Drayton Thomas's sittmg of Feb. 3rd, 1939, Feda says :\n'\nA name starting with BR\u2014rather an important name with him . . .\nsomebody he was linked up with shortly before his passing . . . there\nis a link between this BR . . . and this boy's passing. I also want to\nknow if there is anything to do with him like a little ship ... or a little\nmodel of a ship\u2014something he had on earth and was very fond of.\nHe is showing me something lilvc a toy ship\u2014a fancy ship, not a\nplain one\n\u2014'laborate, rather 'laborate\u2014with a good deal of detail\nshown in it\u2014it seemed to be connected with his earth life\u2014but some\ntime before he passed over, rather early in his earth life, but I think\nit is something that his people have stiU got. . .\n.'\n\" A name beginning with BR\u2014like the name which Feda says\n'\nmight be Mr BRICK '\n\u2014had been mentioned by other mediums,\nbut we had been unable to place it, nor was the reference to a '\nmodel\nship '\nunderstood ; but my son, on seeing the Leonard script,\nrecognised its meaning.\n\" He and his deceased brother had been friends at an R.A.F.\nStation with a yoimg officer called BRIDGEN\u2014whom we had not\nheard of\u2014and who had been killed about a year after my son.\n\" This young man, before joining the R.A.F. , had worked for a firm\nwhich made scale models of ships for shipping companies, and he had\nshown my son a photograph of one of these models which he had\nmade himself and which he said his people still had at home. My\nson had felt sure that this matter of the model ship would be given\nas a sign if they were unable to get the name through correctly.\"\nThese data were accompanied by the following letter :\n\" The Editor,\nJournal of the Society for\nPsychical Research.\n\" Dear Sir,\nI have read my father's account of the '\nLeonard-Aitken\n'\nproxy sittings, and I testify to its correctness.\n\" I was the only living member of the family who knew of\n\fNov.-Dec. 1939 Case 123\n'\nBridgen ', and I had never had any communication with Mr\nDrayton Thomas or Mrs Leonard.\n\" My '\nthought-message '\nwas not directed to Mr Drayton Thomas\nor to Mrs Leonard\u2014but to my '\ndead '\nbrother\u2014and to me, the reply\nwas unmistakable.\nYours sincerely,\nLionel Aitken,\nFlying-Officer, R.A.F.\nNov. Uth, 1939.\nCASE : MISSING PAPERS LOCATED BY AN APPARENTLY\nPARANORMAL PROCESS\nBy W. H. Salter\nThe following incident, though trivial, may be of interest, because\nthe explanation seems to be either clairvoyance, or telepathy from\na mind which had no conscious knowledge of the information sup-\nposedly conveyed to the mind of the percipient.\nMy record of the incident which occurred at our house. The Crown\nHouse, Newport, Essex, runs thus :\n\" 24 Oct. '38.\nTo-day in connection with her forthcoming paper on Tele-\npathy and Clairvoyance, H. [my wife] started looking up the\ncontemporary notes (1931) of some experiments in telepathy\nshe and I had with [friends with whom we had been staying].\nThey had on our return from [our friends] been put in a bureau\nin the drawing room in a pigeon hole where current business\nletters are kept.\nH. had later, at some date she cannot recollect, removed them\nto what she thought was a better place. But she had com-\npletely forgotten where this was, and spent a long time turning\nout drawers, cupboards and files where she keeps S.P.R. papers,\nall in the Study, looking for them in vain.\nI said, \" Haven't you put them in the Bible box? \" This is\nan old oak carved box standing on a stool in the drawing room.\nIts contents were mostly, as I knew, old games and odds and\nends for amusing the children, and what made me suggest this\nplace I cannot think. It, and the original pigeon hole, were the\nonly places I suggested. At long last at about 9.30 p.m.,\nhaving been looking for them, with a short break for a meal.\n\f124 Journal of Society for Psycldcal Research. Nov.-Dec. 1939\nsince about 7, she went to the Bible box, and there under a lot\nof other junk, they were.\nShe was all along quite certain she had not intentionally put\nthem there, and in this she was right. She had on removing\nthem from the pigeon hole, put them in a drawer of her writing-\ntable in the Study, in which she later put some gramophone\nrecords. These she moved to the Bible box and the envelope\nwith the experiments got slipped between the records and\nmoved with them.\"\nThis record was initialled by my wife and myself the same evening\nat 10 p.m. It was sent the following day to Mr Piddington, who\nreturned it with a note, signed by him, \" Read by me on 26 Oct\n1938 \".\nA few words are necessary to make the position clearer. I had\nnever seen the envelope since it had been placed in the pigeon hole\nof the bureau on our return from our friends' house in 1931. It is\nnot our custom to keep papers there permanently, but as I thought\nit just possible that the envelope might have been left there by\ninadvertence, I asked my wife if she had looked there : she had\nlooked, and found it was not there. We have a good number of files,\ndrawers, etc., in which we keep the large mass of S.P.R. papers we\nhave accumulated, but apart from the pigeon hole, the only place\nI suggested was the Bible box, which we do not use to keep any kind\nof papers in. I had not had occasion to look in the Bible box for\nsome time ;\nnot, to the best of my recollection, since the gramophone\nrecords had been put there, but of this I am not sure. It was doubt-\nless because she knew that it was unlikely that any papers would be\nin the Bible box that my wife at first declined to follow my sugges-\ntion by looking there.\nA SUGGESTED ENQUIRY INTO PREDICTIONS\nCONCERNING THE PRESENT WAR\nAfter the end of a war it is not uncommon for a number of stories\nto be current of prophecies made before or during the war, in which\nthe course of events as they in fact occurred is claimed to have been\npredicted, sometimes in considerable detail. But the student who\nlooks for evidence that the prophecies were made in the form and at\nthe time alleged may often find himself baffled by the absence of\ntrustworthy records : for example, it has been stated that as early\nas 1908 Lord Roberts predicted that England and France would be\n\fNov.-Dec. 1939 Correspondence 125\nallies in war, tliat they would come near defeat, but would be led to\nvictory by Foch ; it is, however, seriously doubted whether Lord\nRoberts made any such prediction, at any rate, at that time (see the\nDaily Telegraph for 1-lth November 1939).^ The student may also\nhave reason to suspect that, if events had taken a different turn,\npredictions of quite a different tenor would have achieved publicity.\nWhatever else the present war produces, it will certainly bring its\nown crop of predictions\u2014some are already current\u2014and it seems\ndesirable to collect these before, rather than after, the event. By\nkeeping a record of the misses as well as the hits, while it is still\nuncertain into what group any prediction may fall, it wiU be easier\nto judge whether or not the hits were lucky flukes.\nBut another object of perhaps greater importance may be attained.\nA collection of the kind suggested may throw light uj^on the origin\nand growth of rumours, a matter bearing closely on the question of\nevidential value in many cases of spontaneous phenomena. During\nthe last war the Society conducted an enquiry into the rumoured\nappearance of Angels at Mons, which was highly instructive : see\nS.P.R. Journal, vol. XVII, p. 106.\nIf any of our Members hear of predictions as to the course of\nevents in the present war, will they be so good as to send particulars\nto the Hon. Secretary? Information so given will be treated con-\nfidentially. The particulars should state :\n(1) Who is supposed to have made the prediction,\n(2) Whether the correspondent heard it at first, second or nth\nhand : for the purpose of this enquiry second-hand or more remote\naccounts are of equal value with first-hand ones, if sufficiently\ndetailed.\n(3) What the exact terms of the prediction were, and\n(4) Whether any part of the prediction has already been fulfilled,\nwith details enabling this point to be checked.\nCORRESPONDENCE\nTo the Editor of The Journal\nSir,\u2014I have been reading Mr Harry Price's chatty Fifty Years of\nPsychical Research wath much admiration for his undiminished\ngusto. Naturally minute accuracy is not to be looked for in an\n^ From later correspondence in the same newspaper it seems to be estab-\nlished that Lord Roberts made a prediction to this general effect, though\nnot in so definite a form.\n\f126 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Nov.-Dec. 1939\noeuvre de vulgarisation, peculiarly qualified though Mr Price un-\nquestionably is for the compilation of such a work. Still, there is one\nlittle error I should like to put right. In p. 60 of his book Mr Price,\nwriting of Rudi Schneider, says, \"Following my adverse report . . .\nthe S.P.R. decided to test him\". In fact, Mr Price's adverse report\nplayed as little part in encouraging the Council to investigate Rudi\nSchneider as his previously favourable reports had discouraged them\nfrom so doing. It has always been a rule of the Society to investi-\ngate mediums only where there exists a prima facie case for the\ngenuineness of their phenomena. Dr Osty's report provided such a\ncase and no other factor played any part in the Council's decision\nto investigate the alleged powers of Rudi Schneider.\nYours, etc., Theodore Besterman.\nREVIEWS\nThe Psychic Stream, or The Source and Grovih of the Christian Faith.\nBy Arthur Findlay. Psychic Press, London, 1939 ; pp.\nxvii+1192. 12s.6d.net.\nThe reviewer confronted with the latest of Mr Findlay's books on\nSpiritualism and Religion may at first feel daunted for two reasons,\nthe bulk of the book, and the qualifications which the publishers, in\na slip sent with the review copy, demand of the reviewer. On the\nfirst point he will soon be reassured, because it will at once become\nclear to him that Mr Findlay has succeeded in covering a very wide\nfield in an interesting way. As to the qualifications, he is required\nnot to be \"a priest or minister of any Christian sect\" (the present\nreviewer has no qualms about passing this test), \" but instead . . .\none who is philosophically minded and not antagonistic to Spiritual-\nism \". \" Philosophically minded \" does not, I was relieved to dis-\ncover, appear to imply any intimate acquaintance with meta-\nphysics, but a detached attitude to religious doctrine ; so the only\ndifiiculty that I felt faced with came from the words \" not antagon-\nistic to Spiritualism \". It would seem that to the author Spiritu-\nalism means something more than belief in the survival of bodily\ndeath and communication with those who have departed this life;\nthat it includes belief in the \" etheric body \", which is somehow or\nother connected with the ectoplasm of the seance-room. Spiritu-\nalists who make this very dubious phenomenon the foundation of\ntheir creed seem to me to be adding quite needlessly to the diffi-\nculties of their case.\n\fNov.-Dec. 1939 Reviews 127\nIt is hard to summarise an argument developed in a volume of\n1200 pages, but the following abstract may serve : all gods were\noriginally human beings, who after their death appeared in the\netheric body : belief in them as gods grew up when the believers\nwere cannibals, and thought that the gods could be placated by being\ngiven human beings to eat : from time to time human victims\nappeared in the etheric body after having been sacrificed, thereby\ngiving rise to the behef that the gods had rejected them as sacrifice,\nand that they no longer required human sacrifice : the victims thus\nbecame \" Saviour-gods \", rescuing mankind from the horrors of the\nreligion which they more or less superseded : among the \" Saviour-\ngods \" worshipped in Eastern Europe and the Near East Mr Find-\nlay mentions Bel, Osiris, Dionysus, Mithras, Krishna.\nNow it is to be noted that so far Mr Findlay is dealing with periods\nlong antecedent to the beginnings of history. We have no knowledge\nwhat men thought in Egypt or Greece at a time when cannibalism\nwas still prevalent in those countries. Occasional human sacrifice\ndid indeed linger to a surprisingly late time even in highly civilised\ncountries, but we have no accurate knowledge of any period when it\nwas so habitual there as to determine the cause of religious opinion.\nThere is therefore no direct evidence for a theory which Mr Findlay\npresents as if it were a matter of undisputed fact ; one can only\nargue back from the evidence furnished by later and better known\nperiods. From such evidence it would appear that apparitions of\nthe dead did indeed contribute to the conception of semi-divine be-\nings, such as the heroes in the classical Greek use of the word. But\nthe claim of Euhemerus to have discovered in his travels a monu-\nment proving that all the gods were originally human beings, was\nnot taken seriously in his own time, and is generally, I thinlv, dis-\ncredited. If gods, whether Saviour-gods or not, have all developed\nout of human beings, it is remarkable that they should as a whole\nshow so httle trace of previous humanity.\nThe second stage of Mr Findlay's argument is that mankind has\nalways been in touch with the etheric world through specially\nendowed individuals, whom we now call mediums : that, as the\ngenuine medium could not always make contact with the etheric\nworld when he or his consulters wished, there arose a class of men\nclaiming to make contact, when they wished, and for that jDurpose\nsimulating genuine mediumistic powers : that this class became\npriests, and out of jealousy persecuted the mediums, the persecu-\ntion having been particularly severe among the ancient Jews, but\nnot unknown at the present day : wherever he could, the priest put\nthe medium to death. Another class of pseudo-mediums comprised\n\f128 Journal of Society for PsycJiical Research Nov.-Dec. 1939\nthe magicians, and their obnoxious activities provided the priests\nwith a convenient excuse for putting mediums to death on the\ncharge of witchcraft.\nTo the Mosaic Law it is clear that mediums and magicians were\nequally obnoxious. In the most explicit passage (Deut. xviii, 10, 11)\nprohibitions are directed to some activities which are definitely\nmagical, and to others which are as definitely mediumistic (\" necro-\nmancy \" e.(].) ; but other parts of the same two verses might be\ntaken as applying equally to magicians and mediums. The one per-\nmissible outlet for psychical powers would therefore be prophecy,\nand that only under the limitations imposed in the latter part of the\nsame chapter.\nIt is however rather difficult to suppose as Mr Findlay does, that\nthe Hebrew prophets, while claiming to speak the words of God,\nwere in fact the mouthpieces of \" etheric beings \" who had once\nlived and died on earth, and that this could happen for several\ncenturies, without their innocent mistake being grasped by them-\nselves or detected by others. Why should it be assumed that, if a\nperson can be influenced by external psychic agency, the agency\nmust needs be that of some particular dead man or woman ?\nBut if we go outside Hebrew practice, there does not seem to be in\nthe ancient world much evidence for the systematic persecution\nand extermination of mediums by priests. Only in a monotheistic\nsociety would it be possible to draw a clean line between priests and\napproved prophets on the one hand, and mediums and magicians\non the other : in other conditions there must have been a consider-\nable merging of one group into another, as indeed, in the case of\nGreece, Mr Findlay recognises. But he leaves one with the impres-\nsion that the killing of mediums by priests was general and is well-\nestablished, and his argument would have been a good deal stronger if\nhe had supported it by quoting instances. The only example that\noccurs to me of a medium being put to death is Orpheus, and he\nwas killed, not by priests, but, to follow Mr Findlay's practice of\ntranslating old words into the phraseology of modern Spiritualism,\nby a female Study Circle attached to a rival medium.\nIn his explanation of the origin and growth of the Christian reli-\ngion Mr Findlay combines the two lines of argument already de-\nscribed regarding the origin of pagan Saviour-gods and the killing of\nmediums by priests. This is the main part of his book, and it con-\ntains much that is quite outside the scope of our Society. It may not,\nhowever, be out of place to say that the comments of a man of great\npractical experience who, without being a specialist in history or\ntheology, has read widely on this important subject and given much\n\fNov.-Dec. 1939 Reviews 129\nthought to it, deserve careful consideration even if, and when, they\ndo not command assent.\nThe relations and connections between the various religions\nprevalent in the Graeco-Eoman world shortly before and after the\nbeginning of the Christian era is of immense interest. By stressing\nsome parts of the evidence it is possible to support the thesis that\nChristianity was fundamentally opposed to any and every variety\nof contemporary Paganism : by stressing other parts one can make\nout a case for the view that the significant elements in Christianity\nalready pre-existed in rival religions. To form a just estimate is a\ndelicate task in which sweeping generalisations\u2014and of these Mr\nFindlay seems to me too prolific\u2014are of little service. If the study\nis to be of value, and not merely, to use the phrase of an eminent\nscholar, \"the production of Christian rabbits from Pagan hats \", it\nmust be conducted under stricter rules than Mr Findlay employs.\nTake, for example, the following passage (pp. 443, 444) :\n\" Let us now in imagination go back to these pre-Christian days in\nGreece and Rome. Let us imagine that we are in Athens on a Sim-\nday morning, the first day of the week which the people termed The\nLord's Day.\"\nHere follow six pages describing an impressive liturgy, and then\nwe come on this footnote (p. 450) :\n\" The original Greek of the quotations from the tombstones, and the\ncommittal remarks of the priest, will be found in Anthropological\nReligion by Max Miiller. The Greek text of the chant, hymn and\nprayer was discovered by Reitzenstein in a papyrus of the third\ncentury a.d., and this will be found in the Mystery Religions and\nChristianity, by Dr Angus. The sermon is made up from sayings of\nXenophon. Plato, Socrates and Cicero, and the Benediction is a\nprayer used by the Roman philosopher, Simplicius.\"\nAs one of the tombstones quoted goes back to the fifth century\nB.C. and Simplicius lived well on in the sixth century a.d., Mr\nFindlay has allowed himself rather too much temporal Lebensraum.\nAfter thus explaining the sources of Christianity, Mr Findlay\ndescribes its development, emphasising the evidence that what would\nnow be called \" psychic phenomena \" played a much larger part in\nits early history than in latter times.\nMr Findlay's point of view is in certain respects ultra-rationalistic,\nin others very much the reverse. At many points therefore his\napproach to familiar problems is fresh and helps to retain the\nreader's interest throughout the volume.\nW. H.

Time was when the investigator contentedly\noccupied himself with the \" That \", thinking that evidence to show\nthat supernormal things occur could be collected in independence of\nthe question of hoiv they are possible. But it is turning out to be\nmore and more the case that people demand some explanatory prin-\nciple before they will listen to concrete evidence. The \" How \" is\nantecedent to the \" That \"\n;\nor, at any rate, must run parallel with it.\nM. WarcoUier's work is particularly welcome because it sets forth\nboth aspects of the subject side by side. In this volume, abbrevi-\nated by Dr Gardner Murphy from La Telejmthie and from articles\nby M. Warcollier in La Revue Metapsychique, theoretical deductions\nas to the mode of working of telepathy are drawn from the author's\nown experiments. Since the cases quoted are given for illustrative\nrather than for evidential purposes, it would be unfair to stress the\ncriticism that they are given with insufficient fullness to enable their\nvalue to be assessed as a whole. The degree to which they have been\nselected is not always evident ; neither has statistical control been\napplied to the question of chance-coincidence. On this point, Dr\nGardner Murphy says that, although the author desired it, he \" found\nthat the human situation of working in a group with ten or fifteen\ninterested persons has made a '\nfree '\nmethod of choosing material\nmore workable \".\nThe author's main aim has been to obtain light on the telepathic\nprocess by varying the conditions of experiment. He has even pre-\nferred to work with subjects who are \" only slightly telepathic\n\"\nrather than with first-class sensitives, because he maintains that\npartial failures are more informative than complete successes.\nExperiments with agents and percipients, used singly and in\ngroups, were tried in all combinations. Men were tried against\nwomen ; and sleep, or sleep-like states against waking. The con-\nclusion that the author draws is that \" batteries \" of agents are\nineffective, but a groujD of percipients is better than a single one. A\nsleep-condition is better than waking for agents and percipients\nalike ; and men make the better agents, while women make the\nbetter percipients. He lays stress on mental \" contagion \", or cross-\ntelepathy, which takes place between percipients who are trying to\nreceive the same idea. The pre-establishment of \"accord \" was\npractised, percipients sitting in silence and darkness, and attempting\nto create in themselves a \" void of thought \".\n\fNov.-Dec. 1939 Reviews 131\nOne interesting result was the constant tendency for the form of\nthe message to be received rather than the idea ; and frequently this\nform was fragmentary, like a young child's drawing, in which a head\nmay be drawn on one part of the paper and the eye on another.\nClearly traceable, also, is the effect of association of ideas in the\nemergence of the telepathic message. Awake or asleep, the author\nsays, we are always dreaming, and in the \" unconscious \", through\nwliich the message has to find its way, scattered dream-symbols are\npicked up and used in the mechanism of emergence ; and that is why\nthe results are so fragmentary. Sometimes association leads towards\nthe goal, as in a case in which the word \" teeth \" {dents) was selected\nfor transmission. The percipient wrote D : then Oeil ; ailes d'un\npapillon, qui sont dentelees ; une dentelle ; dent. But sometimes it\novershoots the mark and leads away from it, as in the case of a\npercipient who got correctly the object sent, a rayed star on a black\ndisc, but went on to add :\n\" The blot is growing luminous, and shines\nlike a lighthouse \", which he proceeded to draw.\nThe author appears to vacillate strangely on the question of\nwhether telepathy can be physically explained. We read :\n\" The\nwave-hjrpothesis is not impossible \"\n;\nand, again :\n\" the emission of\nwaves would explain perfectly the agent's role in simple cases ;\n\"\nand, yet again :\n\" physical analogies are no more than conventional\npictures.\" Indeed, a curious indefiniteness in the mode of presenting\nviews and arguments is characteristic of the book as a whole. A\nstrange theory, too, that the agent, by looking at an object, can fix\nupon it a \" psychic charge \", is maintained by the author with a\nconsiderable amount of enthusiasm ; but it is never subjected to\ncritical examination.\nMany of the experiments cited were carried out over considerable\ndistances ;\nand one series took place between Paris and New York.\nThese long-distance trials gave about the same order of success as\nthe others.\nIn spite of the admiralile design underlying the author's work, it\ncannot be pretended that the present book is entirely satisfying.\nDoubt will probably remain in the reader's mind as to whether cer-\ntain of the conclusions reached are based on a sufficiency of experi-\nment ;\nwhile many of the points raised are treated with a lack of\ncritical thoroughness.\nA glossary of terms is appended. There is no index.\nG. N. M. T.\n\f132 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Nov.-Dec. 1939\nFifty Years of Psychical Research : a critical survey. By Harry\nPrice. Longmans. 10s. 6d. net.\nEvery student of psychical research has long felt the need of two\nworks to assist him in his labours. He wants first of all an up-to-date\nedition of the Combined Index to the Journal and Proceedings of the\nS.P.R. ; and secondly he needs a continuation of Podmore's History\nof Modern Spiritualism, which was published in 1902. In other\nwords what is required is a critical survey of the history of psychical\nresearch and spiritualism during the last forty years.\nIn his preface to the present volume Mr Price suggests that he has\nnow fulfilled this task, but it would seem from the contents of the\nbook now under review that few will be found to agree with him.\nWith a number of deletions and additions the work might perhaps be\nused as a handbook or an abstract of the kind of history which could\nbe considered as a worthy continuation to Podmore's classic effort.\nBut, as it is, it is difficult at first to see for what class of reader the\npresent work is intended. It appears to be made up of scattered\narticles, papers and notes, with little attempt to co-ordinate the\nmass of material or evaluate the historical sequence of development.\nOne whole chapter is devoted to an account of an alleged material-\nisation, said to have been witnessed by the author, for which not one\nshred of corroborative evidence is offered. On the other hand some\nthree pages are given to the phenomena associated with the medium-\nship of Mrs Leonard ; less than four lines to Mrs Chenoweth ; whilst\nI have found no allusion amongst the accounts of physical phenomena\nto the Castlewitch sittings, or amongst the mental phenomena to the\nHacking case, the Chafiin Will case or the Thompson-Gifford case.\nSpace which could have been found for these is taken up by an\naccomit of a 25 franc \" medium \" said to have been seen by the\nauthor over a shop in Ostend ;\nby a description of a MS alleged to\nhave been composed by Joanna Southcott ; and by nineteen pages\ndevoted to the text of a proposed Bill to regulate Psychic Practi-\ntioners.\nApart from these deficiences the book contains a general summary\nof many of the principal cases of interest during the last fifty years ;\nand, although we may still be permitted to hope that a successor to\nPodmore may one day be forthcoming, in the meantime we can\nglance over the pages of Mr Price's book, which, with its excellent\nindex, will provide us with a convenient guide to that mass of fraud,\ndelusion, and maybe truth which emerges from the patient work of\nso many enthusiasts during fifty years of psychical research.\nE.

The Address is published in\nPart 160 of Proceedings.\nOBITUARY\nWe deeply regret to record the death at her home in Cambridge on\nthe 13th January of Miss Alice Johnson, an Honorary Member, and\nformerly the Secretary of the Society. It is intended to print later\non a record of some of her eminent services to the Society and to\nPsychical Research.\nANNUAL REPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR 1939\nThe outbreak of War has naturally caused the Council to consider\nwith anxious attention the future policy of the Society. If the\nexperience of the years following on 1914 is a guide, it is very\nprobable that there will be a greatly increased public interest in the\nsubjects which our Society investigates. It is from every point of\nview important that this interest should be directed into channels\nof sane and sober investigation, and that individuals whose emotions\nhave been aroused by the events of the war should be able to avail\nthemselves of the knowledge and experience which the Society has\ngathered over so many years, and to obtain advice based on that\nknowledge and experience. These objects are most likely to lie\nattained if the Society carries on its activities, both in research,\npublication, and the holding of meetings, as fully as war conditions\nwill permit.\nWhile difficulties of travel will make it impossible to arrange\nmeetings as frequently as in peace time, the Council hope to be able\nto arrange several meetings, including those open to the public by\ninvitation. The Journal will probably be issued every alternate\nmonth, and Parts of Proceedings will be published whenever matter\nsuitable for publication is available. So far as can be foreseen, the\nSociety's research work will be continued on much the same lines\nand scale as in recent years. Much will, of course, depend on the\ngeneral financial position. Provided the Society receives such\nsupport from Members as the Council may reasonably expect, they\nare confident that no substantial curtailment of the Society's\n\fJan.-Feb. 1940 Annual Report of the Council for 1939 135\nactivities will be necessary for the present. The CJouncil would none\nthe less welcome the additional income consequent upon an increase\nof membership, and also donations from existing Members, as for\nseveral years past the Society's income has not been sufficient for\nits needs.\n(J) Researc\/i Department. The investigation of the platform\nclairvoyante, Mrs Helen Hughes, mentioned in the report for 1938,\nwas continued, and is described in a paper in Part 158 of Proceedin\/p.\nOwing to the generosity of a Member of the Society, who paid for\nthe making of the process blocks, some of the photographs, to which\nreference was made in the report for 1938, have been reproduced in\nPart 158 of Proceedings, together with a short note on the technique\nemployed.\nThe series of tests of long distance telepathy between London and\nAthens, which was arranged in collaboration with Dr Tanagras, was\ncontinued throughout the spring and early summer. The tests were\ninterrupted at the end of June, l)y which time the weather in Greece\nwas too hot for the Athens group to meet at an early enough hour\nto ensure a sufficient attendance of the London group ; and it was\nhoped that the work might be continued after the reopening of the\nSociety's rooms in September. Owing to the war, this has not been\nfound to be practicable. The results of the tests are by no means\ndevoid of interest, and appear to show some signs of a paranormal\neffect. The statistical analysis which is necessary to estimate the\nprobability of this effect being due to chance is being carried out,\nand it was hoped that it would l)e ready in time for inclusion in this\nreport ; but owing to inx accident to one of the judges who had\nkindly consented to scoie the data, the calculations will not be\ncompleted until the new yoar.\nA few tests were made with the guessing of the images on the\nspecial Zener cards to which reference was made in the report for\n1938, but no subject was found who could score a higher proportion\nof successes than chance could account for. When normal con-\nditions are restored, it is hoped to examine a large number of\nsubjects. This work became increasingly difficult throughout the\nyear owing to the limited amount of time which Ijoth subjects and\nassistants were able to contribute. The Council would desire to\nrecord their indebtedness to all who took part.\nA series of informal sittings with an amateur clairvoyante, the\nwife of a Member of the Society, was held at the rooms. Though\nnothing very striking emerged, the records are of interest in throwing\nsome light on the processes involved in the conventional medium-\n\f136 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jan.-Peb. 1940\nistic sitting. The thanks of the Society are due both to the lady\nherself and to those Members who acted as sitters in the experiment.\nOwing to the great difficulties attendant on all work which\ninvolves a number of people being assembled together at a parti-\ncular time, concentration is being made on tests with individual\nsubjects, and especially on tests in which the subject can function\nin his own home. Such work has the additional advantage that the\nprecautions necessary to ensure that there shall be no normal leakage\nare very much simplified. A programme of experiments in the\nparanormal cognition of drawings and diagrams has been drawn up,\nand a number of tests have already been made with two subjects,\nwith both of whom striking results have been obtained. Special\nattention has been paid to the possible functions of the agent in\ntests of this type. All experiments are designed so that statistical\nmethods of evaluation can be applied, without in any way reducing\nthe value of the data for the purposes of examination from the more\nusual qualitative standpoint.\nThe design of a conveniently portable apparatus for the testing\nof faculties of paranormal guessing has been carefully studied by\nMr. G. Redmayne, who has now constructed an electrically operated\nmachine which automatically selects for guessing one of five alter-\nnative figures or images, receives the subject's guess, and records\nhis success or failure. The testing of precognitive faculty is possible,\nas by means of a simple adjustment the machine can be made to\npostpone its selection until after the subject has made his guess.\nSome trouble was experienced at first in designing a selector which\nwould produce alternatives which were truly independent of each\nother, and at the same time would satisfy the needs of extreme\nportability ; but this difficulty has now been overcome. It is hoped\nthat Mr Redmayne will shortly publish a description of his ap-\nparatus.\nA number of spontaneous cases of seemingly paranormal content\nhave been brought to the notice of the Society, and have been care-\nfully investigated. A few have been of sufficient evidential value\nfor printing in the Journal. The records of the remainder have been\nfiled, and may be examined on application to the Research Officer.\n(2) Other Research Work. A series of large-scale experiments on\nthe Paranormal Cognition of Drawings has been initiated at Cam-\nbridge by Mr Whately Carington with the assistance of Professor\nCD. Broad, Dr Thouless and Mr Oliver Gatty.\nIn four experiments, simple drawings, the subjects for which were\ndetermined by a random method, were exposed from 7.0 p.m. to\n\fJan.-Feb. 1940 Annual Report of the Council for 1939 137\n9.30 a.m. on each of ten successive nights, in the experimenter's\nstudy. Percipients were asked to draw their impressions of these,\nat any time within these limits and wherever they happened to be.\nIn a fifth experiment the experimenter and percipients were in\ndifferent rooms, strictly controlled laboratory conditions being\nmaintained ; in this case, ten trials were made in about an hour.\nAltogether about 250 percipients took part in the experiments, some\nresident in Cambridge, others in London, other parts of England,\nEdinburgh, Holland and U.S.A. They produced about 2,200\ndrawings, which were scored against the 50 randomised originals\nby an independent scorer who did not know which originals had\nbeen used in the different experiments. When the \" hits \" recorded\nwere assembled by experiments, it was found that percipients\ntended to score on the originals of the experiment in which they\nwere concerned significantly more often than the chance expectation.\nFurther experiments are in progress, and it is hoped that a full\nreport will be published in Proceedings in due course.\n(3) Presidency. Professor Henry Habberley Price, Wykeham\nProfessor of Logic in the University of Oxford, consented to accept\nthe Councirs nomination as President for the year. His Presidential\nAddress, entitled \" Haunting and the '\nPsychic Ether '\nHypothesis :\nwith Some Preliminary Eeflections on the Present Condition and\nPossible Future of Psychical Research \", was delivered at a General\nMeeting on 28th November and appeared shortly afterwards in\nPart 160 of Proceedings.\n(4) Myers Memorial Lectureship. The Council appointed the\nVery Rev W. R. Matthews, Dean of St. Paul's, to deliver the Myers\nMemorial Lecture, due to be given in 1939. In consequence of the\noutbreak of War, the date was postponed till January 1910.\n(5) Changes on the Council. Dr William Brown, whose engage-\nments had of recent years prevented him from attending Council\nMeetings, resigned from the Council of the Society during the year.\nIn October the Council co-opted Miss Newton as a member of\nCoimcil.\n(6) Owing to the pressure of his professional work Mr Spinney\nhas felt compelled, to the Council's great regret, to resign the post\nof Hon. Librarian to the Society. The Council wish to place on\nrecord their appreciation of the distinguished services he has\nrendered them, and as a token of this they have elected him an Hon.\nAssociate of the Society.\ni2\n\f1-1 ir; CO o rH\nc: ~ c\u00a3>\ni-H\no w\nci 'r^ -o Ci iH\nCO\n..i?vg\nIs g\n\u2022IS\nCJ o\nO O O CI r\n1-1 i-H\n01 Tf 3C uO !M C; u'^ I> Ci X C\nT-H i-H rH r-l\nr-'l--CCC0C0T}<iftrHC0(MC:O\ni-fr*\u00ab tM r-i 1-1 r-i rH rH O\nrJ4rH (M\n*S J\"* ^ .\nS S S\nSi <\u00bbrK\noi a \u2022o\no o\ntH\nCO o\nOJ\no\n1= ^cr.\n^ =^ CO\n5- -1^ rH\n<iO\n(S*\n^\ng S \u00a7 e^.Ci-e\nS o 2 r\nSit;*!\n5 O ii C (3\nuO CO O O C\n-+ C-l t-'t\n<M M ^\nO O C' c o c\nI- \u2022>! ^\nr-^ 00\n-tit-\n-* !M\n1^\nCO CI O\nI- GO\no\nCO O O\n\"51 i\n<^ ^ ^ ^\n^ ; &^ ^ ?j PH\n^ 5 ^ c\nCO\nCO\no\n;^ Q ?3 (-1\ns a ^ 3\n\f= = o\n-* \u2014- CI\no -* '^)\n^ Ci\n^ ^ \"^S CO\n2 fe\n=<3\nO O =3\n5 o o\nM CO\n^ 5\n-J\nO\nuser-\nS O Q ^\nI\nI;\no to\no\nCO\nX i\nM\n1\n\"S o o\n5: o ^\no\nU< <\n^5 ^ ~P Ci\"\n\u201e- Q o\nSac\nSCO\na3\no\n1-?\nI\u2014\nI\nO\nI\u2014\nI\nft\nP3\n1> o\n-X) o\n\u2022M O\n\u2014i O\n=^ t: .-S\n\u00bb p o\nC ^ 5\nloo\n'5\n-H :d O O C>\no TC\no c\nto o\ntH CD\n- Ah\n2 a ^ o\n3\n\f(3\nX\n1-1\no t-- (N\no C<J o OC\ni-H I>-\n65 .\n^\n& s S \u00ab\n!ii\n'ii\n^\n^ C e c\n\"is\nS sEt; eH Si SO\nso r- ^ ^\n5s\nC\nO\no\nu\nEH\no\no\nS 5?\nM -a ^\nfc. o ^\n= 5 S\nCj S O\nMO\"-'\n3 3\n^ CO iC\nT-i I-\nTO C: X\n.-H r-i -t\nOl -t rH\n- S i\ns w ^\n\u00ab o s\n5^\nop\no\nH\n+J \" o\n\u00ab ^ 5\n^ 5\n-s \u00ab \u00a7\nS ^ =\u00ab\nc t>\nO 3 P\n\"\n* m \u00ab\nCO\n5r\no o\nt\u00ab rj -a\n\u20223 b g\nc c o\no o\nQ O\n>. >>\n-\n\u00a7 Q ^\n3 \u00ab\n* \u00a3 S 5?\ng c <u >.\nW -? \u00a3\ng Q >5 '3\ns? sS ^\no o o o o o\no o c: CO o\nO O O O lTJ o\n-* CO 00 a; o i-\n^{ cfi --4^\n\u00ab\n\u00a3 a o\nO O Hi\nO O O\nirj o GO\ni.o o in\no 00\nrt' o-f\nS c\nCCS\nO M h-l\n-CI\nO\nh-1 W H o\no o o o\no o o o\n\u2022* o o o\nrH O O O\n\u00bbn C-l ?M t-\nc+i :+i ^'\no\n. o\n.\nin C\n^ 5\nC!\n.

The\nseries of books by Messrs Bell & Sons, under the general heading of\nPsychical Experiences \", referred to in the report of the Council\nfor 1938, has been continued by the publication of Evidence of\nIdentity, by Mr Kenneth Richmond. The Council are gratified to\nhear from various quarters that this series has helped to stimulate\ninterest in psychical research of the kind promoted by our Society.\nA like result may be expected from the publication by Messrs Faber\n& Faber of Sir Ernest Bennett's Apparitions and Haunted Houses.\n(8) Hon. Associates. In addition to J\\Ir Spinney, the Council have\nelected as an Hon. Associate Dr Eva Morton, who has been a Member\nof the Society since 1933, since when she has in various ways shown\nan active interest in the Society's work.\n(9) Library. During the year 53 Members borrowed books, and\n84 books were borrowed by the National Central Library for students.\nMembers also availed themselves of the privilege of borrowing books\nfrom other Libraries through tlie Society and the National Central\nLibrary.\n(10) Obituary. Among the losses by death during 1939 must be\nmentioned Professor Sigmund Freud, one of the Society's most dis-\ntinguished Corresponding Members for many years, and at the date\nof his death an Hon. Member of the Society ; Mr David Gow, an\nHon. Associate, and the Rev. Herbert Thurston, S.J., whose\narticles on psychical research and spiritualism are very well known.\nAn obituary notice of Professor Freud appeared in Part 160 of\nProceedings, and of Mr Gow and Father Thurston in the Journal for\nDecember 1939.\n(11) Membership of the Society. During the year 17 new Members\nand 2 Student Associates were elected. The total loss in Members\nfrom deaths, resignations and other causes was 53 Members and\nAssociates, leaving a net decrease of 34 Members and Associates.\nThe total membership of the Society now stands at 654.\nFollowing the precedent set by the Society in the years 1914-18,\nthe Council have decided to suspend from active membership during\nthe present war iiiembers of enemy nationality resident abroad,\nwith the proviso that they should be at liberty at the end of the war\nto resume active membership. The position of any members of\nenemy nationality resident in this country will not be affected.\nWhile communication with enemy countries cannot be main-\ntained during the War, the Council regard the Societv as occupying\n\f142 Journal of Society for Psych ical Research Jax.-Feb. 1940\nan international position and wiW do what they can, subject to the\nlimitations imposed by hostilities, to co-operate to the fullest extent\nwith psychical researchers of whatever nationality.\n(12) Publications. Four Parts of Proceedin(\/s were published\nduring the year : Part 157 in February, Part 158 in March, Part 159\nin July and Part 160 in December.\nThe Secretary's sales to the general public amounted to \u00a325 4s. 2d.,\nand to members of the Society, \u00a314 17s. 3cl. Returns from the\nSociety's agent in the United States amounted to \u00a35 8s. 6d.\n(13) Meetings. The following meetings have been held during\nthe year\n:\n25 Jan. \" Recent Work carried out by the Society \", by the\nResearch Officer.\n29 Mar. \" Experiments in Automatic Writing \", by Miss Geral-\ndine Cummins.\n26 Apr. ' Incidents of Bygone Days \", by Count Perovsky-\nPetrovo-Solovovo\n.\n23 May. \" A Novel Proxy Case and its Implications \", by the\nRev. C. Drayton Thomas.\n28 June. \" A Recent Experiment with Two Automatists \", by\nMr W. H. Salter.\n^28 Nov. Presidential Address, hy Professor Henry Habberley\nPrice.\nA CASE FOR SURVIVAL?\nThe following case has been contributed, under the above title, by\nMr G. Zorab, a new member of the Society, whose report was sent\nto the Hon. Secretary with this letter :\nTo the Secretary of the Society for\nPsychical Research.\nVerdistraat 32,\nThe Hague.\n7 December 1939.\nDear Sir,\nEnclosed I make bold to hand you some information about\na rather interesting case which came within my own observation.\nFrom beginning to end the case was investigated by Mr de Graaf\n^ General Meeting. , : .\n\fJan. -Feb. 1940 A Case for Survival ? 143\nand myself, while all documents, newspapers, etc., relating to the\ncase are in my possession and can be consulted.\nI am, dear Sir,\nYours truly,\nG. ZORAB.\nThe case is described and discussed by Mr Zorab in the following\npages.\nA group of investigators, of which I am a member, has been experi-\nmenting at regular intervals this year with a medium for trance\nphenomena. The medium, a Mrs. Hilgersom-Kleiweg, is a married wo-\nman of about thirty-five years of age and of a not very high educational\nlevel living at the Hague. She is not a professional medium, but\nallows us to experiment with her in order to further Psychical Research\n.\nAlthough of late years the medium has had, as she herself con-\nfirms, fairly frequent clairvoyant visions, premonitions and such\nphenomena as the seeing of \" spirits \", she never went into a trance\nbefore the beginning of this year. In April 1939, however, during\na spiritualistic seance open to the general public, she all of a sudden\nfell into a state which to all appearances looked like a genuine trance.\nAfter this episode we invited her to cooperate as a medium in our\nresearches, to which proposal she kindly consented.\nThe trance condition with this medium is a very quiet one and\nmay come on very suddenly, so that often enough the medium may\nbe off in the middle of a sentence or while relating some joke or story.\nUp to the present the medium only speaks, and does not produce\nwriting, during her trance.\nOn Saturday evening, 6 May 1939, an entity manifested itself\nthrough the medium during a seance and said that its name was\nKlaas Kraaijendonk and that its address had been Willem, Tomberg-\nstraat 2 at Gouda. Gouda is a well-known Dutch town situated about\n18 miles to the east of The Hague.\nThe notes taken down during the sitting are given in full here\nbelow. We would like to point out that the questions put to the\ncommunicator are not mentioned in the report, but the answers only\nwere written down. As this sitting was our first experience with\nthe medium in question and we did not expect anything of import-\nance to crop up, we did not trouble ourselves to have very full notes\nmade, a neglect we now sincerely regret.\nExtract from Refort of the Sitting of 6 Maij 1939\n\" Mother\u2014Gouda\u2014Willem Tombergstraat 2.

But Father and Mother. Antoon and Annie should not think\nonly of worldly things. Don't let them also think of me. Please\ntell them that there is a God. Go to Mother, she needs so much\nsupport.\"\nOn the 15th of May the post office of Gouda informed us that\nthe address for which we had applied was indeed correct, but that\nat the Willem Tombergstraat n\u00b0 2 did not live a family Kraaijenc^ow^\nbut Kraaijen6n>i^-.\nTwo days later Mr de Graaf and I went to Gouda and made\ninquiries at the town hall about the afore-mentioned Klaas K. As\nis the case in many other countries on the continent, everybody in\nHolland is officially registered as regards all sorts of family details,\nbirth, address, etc., and one's family status can readily be ascer-\ntained if needed. Here we received a document, signed by the\nRegistrar, saying that in the municipality of Gouda had been regis-\ntered Klaas Kraaijmhrink, born 12 Jidy 1914, who had died owing\nto an accident on the 25th of March 1939. He had lived at the\nWillem Tombergstraat n\" 2, where his father Dirk Kraaijenbrinh was\nstill domiciled.\nAt the same time we were informed that the family K. consisted\nat that moment of husband and wife K. and their two children\nJohanna (born 1922) and Antoon (born 1926).\nWe also incjuired at the town hall whether the medium or her\nhusband had ever lived in Gouda, and were answered that up till\nthe year 1922 nobody of the names mentioned had been registered\nin the town.\nThereupon we bought a copy of the Goiidsche Courant\u2014the most\nimportant local newspaper\u2014of Monday, 27 March 1939, and in this\npaper we read the following report. As a detailed knowledge of\nwhat has been published in the papers, etc., is absolutely necessary\nin order to allow a plausible explanation to be put forward for the\nphenomena observed, we will give here a complete translation of the\nreport concerning the accident.\n\fJan.-Feb. 1940. A Case for Survival? 145\nChauffeur run o\\er and killed\nTripped behixd backing motor-car\nOn Saturday afternoon a sad accident occured at De Nieuwe\nVaart \", owing to wMcli a young man lost his life.\nAbout a quarter past one a motor-lorry heavily laden with\nsacks, belonging to the firm of N. V. W. Koemans & Zoon, was\nbeing backed from the main road towards the entrance of the\nworks where the sacks are manufactured. The lorry was coming\nfrom Rotterdam. Next to the chauffeur in the cab of the lorry\nwas sitting 2i-year-old N. Kraajenbrink, of Willem Tomherg-\nstraat, who was serving the firm as a chaulTeur. The young man\nhad got out and was walking behind the car as it was backed\ndown the entrance-way, in order to direct the driver along the\nnarrow entrance.\nJust in front of the factory he tripped and fell under the\nlorry coming immediately behind him. One of the hind-wheels\nwent over his head. The man was killed on the spot.\nThe victim was unmarried. His parents lose in him their ordy\nchild. The mortal remains have been transported by the ambu-\nlance of the Medical Service to the Van Iterson hospital. The\npolice investigated the case under the direction of police-\ninspector C. Hess. Of course the car-driver cannot be blamed.\nHe had not noticed anything about the accident.\n^\nAfter having ascertained the above we went to the house of the\nfamily Kraaijenbrink, where Ave were received by the father, Mr K.\nWe started our interview by asking Mr K. whether he knew or\nhad ever heard of a Mrs Hilgersom-Kleiweg or of a ]Mr Hilgersom\nli\\dng at the Hague, i.e. the medimii and her husband, but he at\nonce answered in the negative. This same fact was confirmed by\nhis wife a few moments later. Husband and wife also denied having\never heard of the names of the other members of the group of investi-\ngators in whose circle the manifestation had taken place.\nIt was only after having been satisfied on this point that we began\nexplaining to the parents the object of our visit, which was at first\na by no means easy procedure, as they knew next to nothing about\npsychical research or spiritualism. Mr K., however, though an\nordinary workman at the railway without much education, possesses\nquite a lot of common sense.\nWe read to them the seance report as printed above, which deeply\nmoved them and gave us the impression that several items struck\n^ The italics are mine. (G. Z.)\n\f146 Jcnmial of Society for Psychical Research Jan.-Feb. 1940\nthem jointly as giving an indication that their deceased son was in\nsome way concerned in producing them. The following points were\nconfirmed by them as being correct and in keeping with the facts :\n1. That their youngest son was indeed named Antoon, and that\ntheir daughter, although baptised and registered as Johanna, was\nalways called Annie in the bosom of the family.\n2. That they of course were very much upset by the very sad\naccident, and that the mother was still worrying her heart out about\nwhat had happened.\n3. That the facts related during the seance by the entity pur-\nporting to be the deceased Klaas K., about the clothes, belongings,\netc., of their son, were indeed as stated in the report.\n4. That the statement about the younger son sleeping together\nin one bed with his elder brother\u2014though there was a difference in\nage between the two of about twelve years\u2014was in every way correct.\nAfter the accident the young boy had been so upset that he refused\nto sleep any longer in that same bed alone.\nThe parents, however, informed us that what was said in the last\npart of the report about their religious beliefs and outlook in life\nand those of their living children was not altogether in accordance\nwith the real facts. But at the same time they gave us to under-\nstand that the question of dancing in connection with their daughter\nAnnie had been raised of late, but that the facts were in no way\nsuch as indicated by the communicator on the 6th of May.\nIn order to be able to ascertain whether the medium in question\ncould have got hold of the facts produced in the sitting of the date\nmentioned above by hearsay, through mutual friends of the two\nfamilies, we requested Mr K. to tell us as exactly as possible what\nfriends and acquaintances he and his wife had in The Hague.\nThe only acquaintance he could recall living at The Hague or its\nsuburbs was a certain Mr St., with whose address Mr K. supplied us.\nOf course we paid this gentleman a visit as soon as possible after\nour investigations at Gouda, and here too we learned that he had\nnever known or heard of the married couple Hilgersom-Kleiweg. At\nthe same time it became clear that the acquaintance between Mr St.\nand the family K. at Gouda was but a very slight one.\nThough there was no doubt about the fact that the report pub-\nlished about the accident in the Goudsche Courant of the 27th of\nMarch 1939, this being the most important local paper with the\nlargest circulation in that neighbourhood, was the most compre-\nhensive and gave most details, so that we felt sure that any other\naccount of this accident in any other newspaper, which the medium\n\fJan. -Feb. 1940 A Case for Survival ? 147\nmight have read, would not contain more particulars about the sad\nevent or its victim than those already related in the Gouda paper,\nwe still took the trouble to look up some newspapers circulating in\nThe Hague, among which was the Nieuivshron, the paper regularly\nread by the family of the medium and by herself. Both the\nHaagsche Couraiit and the Nieuivshron gave very short summaries\nin a few lines about this occurrence, while the Nieuwsbron only men-\ntioned the victim of the accident with the wrong initials of N. A'.,\ninstead of giving the full Gouda reading of N. Kraaijenbrink, which,\nas we know, was also incorrect, but should have been Klaas K.\nObituary notices did not appear in the papers, so that the mediuni\ncould not have got hold of the names of the brother and sister, etc.,\nof the deceased Klaas K. through such notices.\nIt goes without saying that not a word was said about all these\ninvestigations and the results to the medium or her husband. Only\nafter all the information had been collected and the whole corre-\nspondence carried out did we inform the medium of some of the\nresults obtained. The communicator Klaas K. only made one\nappearance, and, even after the medium had become acquainted\nwith some of the facts, never came forward again.\nAll documents and papers relating to the case here described are\nopen to inspection for those who would like to have a look at\nthem.\nPossible explanations.\nBefore proceeding to paranormal explanations of the phenomena\ndiscussed here, let us first try and see whether a normal explanation\ncan be found to fit the facts.\nShameless deceit by the tnedium. or one or more of the jwrsons forming\nthe group of investigators.\nAlthough such a deceit is not impossible, it may in this case be\nexcluded, as, firstly, the integrity of everybody concerned is above\nsuspicion (we know each other weU), and, secondly, as the\/om. and\ndetails of the communication show several little mistakes, which the\nmedium, in case she had intended to deceive us all by making up a\nbrilliant \" test-case \" beforehand, would in all probability not have\nmade. At the same time, she being a simple-minded woman and\nknowing nothing about psychical research, it is, in my opinion,^\npsychologically impossible for this medium to have thought out and\nstaged such a subtle and cunning deceit.\nx^s far as our investigations in this direction could be extended,\nno direct or indirect channel could be discovered through which the\nmedium could have received the necessary information and details-\n\f148 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jax.-Feb. 1940\nproduced in the seance communication, either by hearsay or by\nwritten account.\nIn our possession are signed declarations, not only of all members\nof the group of investigators, but also of Mr Kraaijenlirink of Gouda,\nsaying that none of the persons concerned in this case knew or had\never heard of one another.\nCryptomnesia, or unconscious memory.\nIt is a well-known fact that in trance or such-like condition, which\ngenerally is accompanied by a lowering of the threshold of conscious-\nness, a great many forgotten memories of what has once been read,\n\u2022experienced, heard, etc., may become accessible and are then often\nproduced by mediums clothed in a spiritualistic garb. When I heard\nat the town hall at Gouda that Klaas K. had died owing to a very\nsad accident and that an account could probably be found in the\nGouda newspaper, the idea was at once forced upon me that in this\ncase, as in so many others, cryptomnesia would in all probability\nprovide a more than ample explanation. This, however, has been\ndisproved by the facts.\nCryptomnesia is in very many cases certainly able to explain\ninformation imparted by mediums, if this can be traced to what\nthe medium in question has read, heard, experienced, etc., at an\nearlier date, but completely forgotten at the time of reproduction.\nBut cryptomnesia cannot explain the production of particulars and\ndetails which in the original source to which the information should\npresumably be traced is incorrect or defective, while the mediumistic\nutterances are in these particulars correct and give facts not to be\nguessed or reasonably inferred.\nIn the case at hand we have had the luck to come up against an\ninstance in which it was found that the newspaper report itself ex-\ncludes the possibility of using cryptomnesia as a fitting explanation\nof the phenomena observed. This newspaper report contains several\nincorrect points as to family conditions, name, address, etc., which,\nif the medium had really borrowed from this source, should also\nhave been reproduced incorrectly and not, as may be seen in this\ncase, correctly, l^y the communicator purporting to be the deceased\nXlaas Kraaijenbrink himself, and which he, alive, would have known\n\"very well.\nThe principal mistakes in the report of the Gouda Gourant, com-\npared with the correct statements by the communicator, are the\nfollowing : N. Kraaijenbrink instead of Klaas Kraaijenbrink ; his\nparents lose in him their only child, while the communicator without\n.a moment's hesitation names his brother Antoon and his sister\n\fJan.-Feb. 1940 A Case for Survival ? 149\nAnnie : the number of Kraaijenbrink's house (number 2), not men-\ntioned in the Cxouda report, was also given at once.\n'\nOnce conscious deceit and cryptomnesia have been excluded as\nnormal explanations, we have the right to pass on to 'paranormal\nexplanations.\nParagnosis : Extra-sensory Percept imi or telepathy hetiveen the living.\nAnimistic explanations.\nI quite agree with Mr Salter when he says in his letter to the\nJournal (1939, p. Ill) that \" when the evidence can equally well Ije\ninterpreted either on the hypothesis of telepathy from the living or\nof communication from a discarnate mind, preference should be given\nto the former \". In accordance with this thesis we shall start here\nby giving every precedence to animistic theories in order to try to\nexplain the phenomena described here. The great difficulty, how-\never, is that up till now we have but a very vague idea how telepathy,\nor, perhaps better, paragnosis, works and how and where its possi-\nbilities are bounded. The marking off of these boundaries is at\npresent still dependent on personal opinion, and I therefore beg that\nmy arguments may be considered from this point of view.\nPersonally I am of opinion that paragnosis with its two char-\nacteristic features, telepathy and clairvoyance, cannot give an\nadequate explanation for this case, and this simply because there\nwas, before or during the seance, nothing whatsoever\u2014at least as\nfar as we were able to discover\u2014to evoke the paragnostic powers\nof the medium or to guide them in a certain direction. Experience\nhas taught us that in order to bring about some paragnostic con-\nnection or phenomenon there must be something to stimulate the\ncoming into action and the guiding of the paranormal capacities of\nthe medium, psychic, etc. (the so-called \" influences \" of Mrs Piper ;\nsome psychometric object : a person or thing, who or which can be\nused as a stepping-stone to reach the mind of another person from\nwhom the information can be obtained ; a name, etc.) But in this\ncase no such an evoking and directing link or traite (T union can be\ntraced. During the sitting we are discussing nobody was present\nwho knew anything about this Klaas Kraaijenbrink or had friends\nor acquaintances who knew the deceased young man, and whom the\nmedium could have used as a stepping-stone to come into contact\nwith the mind of, say, the father or mother of Klaas K. and so get\nhold of the particulars communicated by the soi-disant Klaas\nKraaijenbrink.\nKeeping all this in view, we have to admit that an animistic para-\ngnostic explanation does not fit the facts, as we cannot understand\n\f150 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jan. -Feb. 1940\nhow the medium came into contact telepathically with a mind to\nwhich nothing whatsoever directed her. For why was the medium\nguided in the direction of some mind in order to enable her to obtain\ninformation of this Klaas K., unknown to all concerned in the sitting?\nReferring once again to Mr Salter's letter [Journal, 1939, p. Ill),\nI am also in complete agreement with him when he says that we\nmay not allow ourselves \" some fantastic exaggeration of the scope\nof telepathy between the living, but only what may reasonably be\ninferred as possible from the relevant evidence, spontaneous and\nexperimental \".\nSpontaneous and experimental evidence in mediumistic and para-\nnormal phenomena has taught us that as long as a link, however\nsubtle, can be traced between the medium and a particular living\nmind from which the particulars communicated may be derived, or\nwhen something is present which may evoke and direct the para-\ngnostic powers of the medium\u2014though these conclusions mean\nstretching the evidence to an impermissible extent\u2014there is always\nthe possibihty that the phenomena observed may be animistic in\nnature. But if no such link can be indicated, the possibility\u2014at\nleast in my opinion\u2014increases that a particular manifestation, which\nalso shows several other personal characteristics, is due to the in-\nfluence of the discarnate mind purporting to be present.\nIf we bear the above in mind I think it can fairly be said that on\nthe whole a spiritualistic explanation better fits the facts than a\n100% animistic hypothesis.\nSpiritualistic explanation.\nTaking everything into consideration, I think that the greater part\nof the items communicated are most easily explained by ascribing\nthem to an influence practised on the medium in some way or other\nby the discarnate mind of Klaas K. Reviewing the number of suc-\ncessful hits to be observed in this communication, we find that these\nare far greater than those to be classified as doubtful or wrong.\nVery significant in this connection is, in my opinion, the little\nsentence :\n\" I have also a brother, who slept with me.\" This shows\nthat an association of ideas, typical for Klaas K., was tapj^ed when\nthe communicator said\u2014without any urging\u2014that he had a little\nbrother and they slept together. For Klaas K. the association\nbrother and sleeping together was a highly characteristic and very\npersonal part of his mind-constellation during his life ;\nand indeed\nit was a fact that these two, though there existed a great difference\nin age between the two brothers, had shared the same bed for several\nyears. Thinking of his little brother would very probably have\n\fJa>\\-Feb. 1940 A Case for Survival ? 151\nbrought up at the very same time the association of sharing the\nsame bed, an association so strong and personal with this Klaas K.\nthat even after death it was produced when he was thinking of his\nbrother : with the result that automatically the thought was followed\nup by \" who slept with me \". I am therefore of the opinion that\nthis association of ideas, simple enough in itself, may be claimed as\nhighly characteristic of the personality of Klaas K. and as identifying\nthe communicator as really being Klaas K. That is to say, that in\nsome way or other the discarnate mind of Klaas K. was behind and\ndirecting the utterances of the medium.\nOf course we should not pick out this one item and then claim\nthat the communicator has proved his identity by this very fact.\nNo, we should only see it as a part which logically and reasonably\nfits in the framework of the whole personality as brought forward\nduring the manifestation. And if we consider all the items in this\nway, we become aware that a great many successful hits were made,\nbut that the wrong and doubtful ones are but few.\nNot only did the communicator state correctly his address and\nthe names of his brother and sister, but some information was also\nsupijlied which, though not to be classified as excellent, gave some\ncharacteristic particulars in accordance with the personality of\nKlaas K.\nThus, for example, the saying :\n\" My birthday must be near at\nhand.\"' (The seance took place on the 6th of May and Klaas 's\nbirthday would have fallen on the following 12th of July.)\nAnswering a question as to his age the communicator said : '\"I\nwas already nineteen years old.\" (Klaas was twenty-four years old\nwhen the accident occurred ; a fact which was also stated in the\nnewspaper report.) In this connection I would like to point out\nthat he was also asked\u2014he could not remember his correct age at\nonce\u2014whether he had already served in the army (in Holland we\nhave conscription), but we were answered no, Klaas had not served\nin the army. (This has not been mentioned in the record of the\nsitting, but both Mr de Graaf and myself remember the question\nput to the entity purporting to be Klaas K., and the negative\nanswer.) At the town hall at Gouda we also made inquiries about\nthis matter and were informed that Klaas K. had not been called\nup for military service.\nAlso the cause of his death was aptly described by the saying :\n\" Terrible, I was gone suddenly.\" The official medical report\nascribes death to fracture of the base of the cranium.\nAs only partly correct we may classify the wrong ending of the\nname : Kraaijent^owA; instead of Kraaijen6fm^.\n\f152 Journcd of Society for Psychical Research Jais^-Feb. 1940\nMore or less wrong, at least if we may believe the parents, is the\nlast part of the communication, i.e. the remarks about the religious\nbeliefs and ethical ideas of his family. The parents confirmed, how-\never, that there existed a connection between dancing and the sister\nAnnie, though not in the way indicated. Of course we could not\nvery well press this point and delicacy forbade asking too many\nquestions about this matter.\nAs the point about dancing in connection with Annie was only\nbrought forward after the death of Klaas K., it remains possible that\nthe entity who communicated during the sitting was able to make\nobservations after the death of Klaas K. The entity's remarks about\nits clothes and other belongings may also point in the same direction.\nWhy the last part of this communication shows more mistakes\nthan the first part is perhaps not so very easily exjolained. It is\npossible that the medium, on whom the communicator was perhaps\nloosening his hold, getting impressed by the ideas dancing and Annie,\nstarted to embroider these items on her own behalf and produced\nin this way the wrong statement at the end of the communication.\nIt is not impossible that in this case too there occurred something\nof the kind observed by Fr. van Eeden during the communication\nof the Dutch entity Sam through the medium Mrs Thompson (Proc.\nS.P.R., vol 17, pp. 110-111).\nWhichever explanation one would prefer to accept for this case,\nI think that there can be no doubt that the case is interesting enough\nto be stated as fully as possible.\nG. ZORAB.\nIMAGES OF THE SELF\nIn his Presidential Address, Professor Price alludes to the difiiculty\nof supposing an image, perceived as \" the ghost of \" a given person,\nto have originated in the mind of that person, and asks (Proc.\nVol. XLV, p. 330) :\n\" Is it not most uncommon to form an image\nof one's own body\u2014especially an accurate one? The puzzle is\nincreased by the fact that the image would have to represent the\nvisible appearance of one's own body as seen from without.\"\nA member of the Society, Baroness de Kallucs, has sent to the\nJournal an example of such image-formation, occurring to herself\nin a half-awake state, and notes that she often experiences the usual\ntype of hypnagogic dream-picture, \" nearly always of imaginary\nplaces, quite distinct and in very bright colours \". \" It is very\nunusual \", she says of these pictures, for me to see people.\" Her\n\fJan.-Feb. 1940 Images of the Self 153\nexperience of a self-image differed from her usual hjrpnagogic pic-\ntures, which are small\n\u2014\" as if seen through the wrong end of race-\nglasses\n\"\n\u2014and \" seem to be under my eyelids \", as will be noticed\nin the following note of the experience and its circumstances :\n\" It was in the afternoon, when I had been sitting trying to con-\ncentrate my mind on a certain subject. It [the image] appeared to\nbe life size, standing in front of me and smiling at me as though it\nsaw me. It did not move. It was a composite picture, as I\nnoticed it was wearing the same green dress which I actually had\non, while at the same time it looked very much younger, and had\nits hair done in an old-fashioned way with a fringe.\n\" I was not asleep, but in that half-way state which generally\nends in sleep. On this occasion I was so much interested in this\ncurious apparition that I woke up completely.\"\nThis is an excellent example to show that a self-image can in fact\nbe formed and externalised as an object of perception for the person\nforming the image. Other members may perhaps be able to furnish\nsome answer to the president's question whether such experiences\nare very uncommon. Probably the least uncommon experience of\nthe kind is to see a clear image of the self as a participant in the\naction of an ordinary dream. It woidd be of interest if members\nwould send notes of any self-images, occurring in dreams or other-\nmse, which have occurred in their own experience or that of their\nfriends.\n-\nREVIEWS\n'Symposium on ESP methods at the meeting of the Southern Society\nfor Philosophy and Psychology', The Journal of Parapsychology,\nIII, 1, June 1939, Duke University Press, Durham, N.C\npp. 85-115.\nThe methods discussed in this symposium are largely refinements\nin the mathematical treatment of ESP data, with an interesting\narticle by Dr J. G. Pratt on an improved experimental method.\nA mathematical question which has recently been raised in con-\nnection with experiments on clairvoyance and telepathy is how far a\npositive result might be produced by stopping a series of trials at a\nfavourable point. In this symposium, Dr V. W. Lemmon suggests\nthat if a subject is making purely chance guesses and that if we stop\nhis series every day at a point when the cumulative average is above\nchance, every day will show a positive result although every guess\n\f154 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jan.-Feb. 1940\nlias been recorded. This is an argument which might take in the\nman in the street, but its fallacy should have been obvious to an\nexperimental psychologist. If the series is merely a chance one,\nstopping each day at favoural)le points will be no different in effect\nfrom making all the observations in one long series, and then drawing\na vertical line to divide them off in sections, each of which has a\npositive total. Obviously no such process could alter the final total.\nThe fallacy in this criticism was, of course, pointed out liy other\nmembers of the symposium.\nIf there is a fallacious effect of optional stopping, there is also a\nreal one, and this was dealt with by Dr T. N. E. Greville and Dr J. A.\nGreenwood. In a random series one could very generally get a\npositive deviation by selecting, not the stopping point of each day's\nwork, but the stopping point of the whole series at a place where the\ndeviation happened to have become satisfactorily large. Such a\ndeviation might even appear significant if tested by a method which\ndid not take into account the method of selection of the end-point\nof the series. This source of error may be avoided by any method of\nselecting the end-point which does not favour a positive deviation\n(e.g. by fixing in advance the length of the series) or by making a\ncorrection in the critical ratio accepted as significant. Apparently\nthe maxinmm value but not the exact value has been determined\nfor tliis correction.\nDr J. G. Pratt's method of testing ESP is one in which the pack is\nhandled by the experimenter behind a screen. The pack is dis-\ntributed into five heaps corresponding to the five symbols of the\nZener pack. Which heap belongs to which symbol is indicated to the\nsubject by guide cards hung above the heaps on his side of the\nscreen in an order not known to the experimenter. This seems\nsatisfactorily to rule out both the possibility that the subject may ])e\nguided by sensory cues and also the possibility that the experi-\nmenter's bias may lead him to deal cards into the right packs.\nSpeed of working is an important consideration in a technique of\nESP experimentation, not only because it is desirable to get as many\nresults as possible for a satisfactory statistical demonstration, but\nalso because it is not impossible that a rapid rate of working may\nfavour the appearance of the phenomena. In this respect too, this\nmethod of experimenting appears to be satisfactory. Pratt reports\nan average rate of about fifteen seconds for the run of twenty-five\ncards.\nEgbert H. Thouless.\n\fJ AN. -Feb. 1940 Reviews 155\nMy Life as a Search for the Meaning of MediumsJiip. By Eileen\nJ. Garrett. Oquaga Press, New York, 1939.\nThis is the second book of late years in which an intelligent woman\nhas written an analytical study, on autobiographical lines, of her\npsychic perceptions and experiences. (Cf. Man's Latent Powers, by\nPhoebe Payne, reviewed in the Journal, Vol. XXX, p. 205.) Both\nhad the fortune or misfortune of being born with a considerable\ndegree of what is now respectably called extra-sensory perception,\nand it is interesting to find how very similar, in certain ways, were\ntheir experiences, living as they did among ordinary adults who\nknew nothing of their special fields of perception. The result was\nthat the writers were in each case driven into a bewildered isolation\nbecause those around seemed so extraordinarily clumsy, ignoring\nwhat to these children were obvious facts. Little did either realise,\nuntil they were growing up, that others did not see the world as they\ndid. And even then the realisation came as a shock, on the one hand,\nand an explanation, on the other, of why people seemed so tactless\nand destructive among the subtleties of the psychic life. There is\nalso a corollary lesson to parents in these books showing how an open\nmind would save much suffering and damage to a child who appears\nunduly imaginative.\nThis book is not by any means a scientific one in the narrow sense :\nno proofs are offered. That is an aspect of research which can, how-\never, well be left to the mechanised type of psychic researcher, who\nhas in the past done much reliable work, if only by elimination, in\nestablishing the occurrence of parapsychological phenomena.\nNowadays, however, when all but the \" closed \" mind accepts these\nas facts, this book offers something of greater interest, which is a\nrecord of what is obviously real experience. The writing is simple,\nalmost bald. And in spite of an aggravating tendency to italicise\nwords, it conveys a quality of insight and self-criticism which makes\nit worth studying. Miss Phoebe Payne, the writer of the other book\nmentioned, comments as follows :\n\" Mrs Garrett's book is to me a simple straightforward exposition\nof experience as lived by the natural-born psychic. We are all\nequipped with a psychic mechanism and have embryonic psychic\ncapacity, but there are few people who are self-aware, with a sense of\ndirection in their psychic life. Mrs Garrett is one who has been\npsychically aware and vividly alert from earliest childhood, and her\ndescriptions from then on to maturity are essentially honest and\ndescribe the dual quality of daily life as I have always known it.\"\nOne may question some of Mrs Garrett's conclusions about the\nnatuxe and mechanism of psychic perception. But, since science has\n\f156 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jan.-Feb. 1940\nnot yet turned from proving and re-proving what has akeady been\noften proved, to studying the physics of the psychic worlds or the\npsychology of the percipient of them, one cannot, either, say that\nshe is wrong in her views. We are, moreover, coming to realise that\nthere is real value when a person describes experiences, whether\nobjective or subjective, psychic or material, which are live and\ndynamic to that person. It is here that the interest of this book is\nto be found. Would it be too much to suggest that we should learn\nmore about psychic research from a deeper study of personal experi-\nences such as these, than in dissecting (and therefore killing) sporadic\nphenomena occurring here and there?\nLaurence J.

Candler (Associate) and Mr Kenneth Richmond\n(Hon. Associate).\nThe Hon. Secretary read the Notice convening the Meeting.\nThe Hon. Treasurer, in presenting the accounts said that there\nwas little to comment on. The Society was \u00a3145 down on the year,\nindicating that we had great difficulty in the endeavour to keep\nwithin our income. Unfortunately we had dropped our membership\nby 34. This loss was more due to lack of new Members than resigna-\ntion of old ones. The coming year would necessarily be an anxious\ntime financially.\nThe Hon. Secretary said it was a matter of some anxiety that our\nmembership was declining, but considering that for the last ten\nyears the country has been moving through a series of financial\ncrises, he thought the Society had done well to keep the membership\nas high as it was.\nMr Salter moved the adoption of the Balance Sheet and the\nAnnual Report. This resolution was seconded by the Hon. Mrs\nAlfred Lyttelton, and carried unanimously.\nThe Chairman announced that there were no candidates for\nelection to membership of the Council, other than the six members\nwho retired by rotation and sought re-election. The following six\nmembers were accordingly unanimously elected : Lord Charles\nHope, Mr G. W. Lambert, Dr T. W. Mitchell, Mr W. H. Salter,\nMrs W. H. Salter and Admiral the Hon. A. C. Strutt, R.N.\nMessrs Miall, Savage, Avery & Co. were re-elected Auditors for\nthe forthcoming year.\nK2\n\f160 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Maech-Apeil 1940\nThe Hon.

V. C. Herbert.\nThe 168th Private Meeting of the Society was held in the Society's\nLibrary on Wednesday, 20 March 1940, at 5.30 p.m. Mr W.

Whately Carington, which will be\npublished in Proceedings.\nMISS ALICE JOHNSON\nAfter Part 161 of our Proceedings, containing an Obituary of Miss\nAlice Johnson had gone to press, we received some further par-\nticulars of her scientific work, which will be of interest to our\nmembers.\nIn 1884 she contributed to the Proceedings of the Royal Society\na paper \" On the changes and ultimate fate of the blastophore in the\nnewt {Triton Cristatus) ; this paper was later printed in an expanded\nform in the quarterly Jo\u00abr\u00aba? of Microscopical Science. In 1886 she\ncontributed to the Proceedings of the Royal Society, a further paper\n\fMaech-Apkil 1940 Miss Alice Johnson 161\n' On the development of the Cranial nerves of the newt \". At that\ntime contributions by women to the Royal Society's Proceedings\nwere a considerable rarity.\nA former colleague of Alice Johnson writes :\n\" When the Society was housed in \"20 Hanover Square, it had for\nneighbour the Irish Literary Society, of which W. B. Yeats was a\nleading member. He used sometimes to drop into the Society's\nrooms, and on one occasion after a talk with Alice Johnson, whose\nattitude to psychic phenomena was a good deal more critical than\nhis own, he said to me, as he left the office, '\nIt is my belief that if\nyou people had been standing round when the Almighty was\ncreating the world. He couldn't have done ut.'\n\"\nCASE : COINCIDENT DREAMS\nThe following was communicated to the Society by The Hon. Mrs\nRobert Trefusis, O.B.E. :\nStatement by Mrs Trefusis\nOn the morning of February .5th Miss Granville Hey came into\nmy office and told me the following : That the night l^efore, viz.\nthe Sunday night, February 4th, she had had an awful dream, that\nshe had dreamt that Mary Bromwich was being murdered, that she\nsaw it quite distinctly, and that I had appeared and started the\nmost awful screaming, and went on and on. She said that in her\ndream she said to herself : this cannot be real, as Mrs Trefusis\nwould never scream like that.\nMary arrived in the building about half an hour after this, and a\nlittle later on when I went into the office where she works, she said\nto me, \" Wasn't it funny Miss Granville having that dream, as I\ndreamt that I was being murdered last night.\" I said at once,\n\" Did you tell Miss Granville that before or after she told you of\nher dream? \" and she said, Oh, I didn't mention it until Miss\nGranville told me.\"\nHowever, she then told me that she had told her husband about\nher dream that morning, and I have ascertained that she told him\nbefore she had had any communication with either of us.\n(Signed) Dorothy M. E. Trefusis\nAt the request of the Research Officer, Mrs Trefusis has obtained\nthe following signed statements from Miss Granville Hey and Mrs\nBromwich.\n\f162 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March-Apkil 1940\nStatement by Miss Granville Hey\nOn Sunday night, February 4th, 1940, I dreamt that Mrs Brom-\nwich and I were in the back of an old-fashioned open touring car.\nSuddenly when the car was stationary, Mrs B. was shot through\nthe left temple. She fell back but was not apparently dead. Before\nI could attend to her, Mrs Trefusis rushed up and started screaming,\n\" Who did it? \" ; but there did not appear to be anyone else there.\nOn arrival at the Oifice on Monday morning, I told Mrs Trefusis\nabout it, about half an hour before Mrs B. arrived.\nI have never before dreamt about Mrs Bromwich or Mrs Trefusis.\n(Signed) E. Granville Hey\nStatement by Mrs Bromwich\nI dreamt I was at a railway station, and on the opposite platform\nthere seemed to be a nasty crowd. Instead of rails, water separated\nus. This crowd came across to our hut,^ and we tried to prove to\nthem they could do us no harm as we showed them the needles we\nhad which could kill someone : they were like large gramophone\nneedles.\nWell, we thought they had gone. Next I remember being in a\nroom and turning round and seeing one of the men, and he had the\nneedles and started hurling them at me, and I felt them going into\nmy body ; and in the room with me was my small niece and I was\nterrified they would touch her and screamed for my sister-in-law\nbut she never came. I just felt myself dying and could do nothing,\nand the fear of my niece being hurt was worrying me.\nI told my husband when I woke up what a nasty dream I had\nhad.\nI have never before dreamt of being murdered.\nDream took place between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. on night of Sunday,\nFebruary 4th.\n(Signed) Mary D. Bromwich\nStatement by Mr Bromwich\nMy wife told me about this dream the next morning, and how she\nhad been murdered by a form of a silver needle.\n(Signed) H. G. Bromwich\nThe original statements are in the possession of the Society.\n1 In answer to an inquiry, Mrs Bromwich has explained that in her dream\nthere was a hut on the platform instead of a waiting-room.\n\fMaech-Apeil 1940. A Glimpse into the Future ? 163\nA GLIMPSE INTO THE FUTURE?\nBy T. R. C.\n[The following record of a personal exjDcrience has been sent by a\ncorrespondent who is known to us as a scientifically interested\nobserver of subjective events. F. W. H. Myers, referring to the\npossible nature of experience at or immediately following the time\nof death, speaks of a small group of cases, which I admit to be\nanomalous and non-evidential\u2014for we cannot prove that they\nwere more than subjective experiences\u2014yet which certainly should\nnot be lost, filling as they do, in all their grotesqueness, a niche in\nour series otherv^dse as yet vacant.\" ^ The present record is an\ninteresting addition to the few cases of this type which are available.]\nDuring the afternoon of 22nd June 1939, having been seriously ill\nfor two or three days, I began to feel that I might not live much\nlonger.\nBy about 9.0 that night I had become entirely resigned to death.\nAn injection given me by the doctor failed to produce sleep except\nfor very brief periods, and my vitahty got gradually lower in a\nfluctuating way. More than once it reached a very low level, when\nI felt a numbness in my feet. On one occasion the numbness crept\nupwards until there was no sensation of feeling below my knees\nand very little in my fingers and hands. For a moment my heart\nsuddenly failed to beat and I was convinced that the end had come.\nThe following account is an attempt to describe my feelings on\nthis particular occasion ; but more than once during the night I had\nthe same experiences, though in a less vi\\dd form.\nI seemed to be descending a vertical shaft or tube roughly the\nshape of an inverted chimney-stack. (It may, however, have been\ncylindrical, the shghtly conical aspect being just a matter of per-\nspective.) The shaft seemed if anything rather narrow in diameter,\nbut there was no feeling of constriction. Nor was there any sense\nof gravity, or of going down head or feet first\u2014in fact no physical\nfeehng at all except that of sight and descent. (The speed was per-\nhaps rather rapid at first but subsequently indeterminate.)\nI cannot describe what composed the shaft beyond saying that it\nseemed to be made of some impenetrable unmaterial substance or\nvapour, intensely luminous in appearance\u2014not absolutely white,\nmore a very light cream colour\u2014and had a definite mesh-shaped\n^ F. W. H. Myers, Human Personality, Vol. II, \u00a7713. The whole passage\nsuggests some explanation of the \" dreamlike and fantastic \" form which such\nexperiences are observed to take.\n\f164 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Maech-Apeil 1940\npattern of black intersecting lines in squares. Owing to their\nextreme brightness it was impossible to see through the sides or\nwalls.\nSome distance below the bottom of the open shaft, which ended\nas it were in mid-space, was a flat level surface resembling an\napparently endless desert of which I could only see a comparatively\nsmall part ;\nthough as I nearecl the bottom the range of vision\nautomatically expanded. Above this surface was an indescribable\natmosphere unlike anything on earth, dull and opaque, rather dimly\nlit and all of one monotonous colour, a curious dark drab. It gave\nme the impression of being boundless except for the level surface\nbelow.\nThe atmosphere was not uninhabited though it is impossible to\ndescribe its occupants of whom I caught only the vaguest ghmpses\nas they hovered about half-hidden in a sort of foHage. (I felt cer-\ntain that these winged spirits or souls, whatever they were, had all\npreviously lived on this earth.)\nI can think of no other positive terms in which to describe what\nmight perhaps best be called The Shades \". The main impressions\nit made on my mind were negative, set out very roughly in order of\nintensity as follows\n1 . Monotony of drab colour.\n2. Silence.\n3. Absence of pleasure.\n4. Extreme banahty, sombre rather than actually melancholic.\n5. A feeling that everything was of a lower order, or on a lower\nscale than what one is accustomed to on earth.\n6. A considerable differing from earthly conceptions of time and\ndistance, too vague for exposition or even for clear comprehension\nat the time.\n7. Absence of pain. (This may have been an afterthought.)\n[N.B.\u2014These impressions would naturally arise from the before-\nmentioned absence of all physical feeling except that of sight.]\nThe main sensations I experienced were as follows :\nThe shaft was simply a brief transitional state of being, connecting\nlife on this earth with that of The Shades.\nI had actually left this earth, but as long as I remained in the shaft\nit would be possible for me to return.\nThere Avas no sense of my going to fall through the bottom of the\nopen shaft on to the surface beneath\u2014as aforesaid, no sense of\ngravity. If I did reach the bottom of the shaft I should simply\nescape or move from its confines into the Shades, at which moment\n\fMarch-April 1940 A Glimpse into the Future ? 165\ndeath would occur, and return to earth would become wholly\nimpossible. I should then no longer be in any way confined, but\nfree to explore at my leisure and will, in novel conditions of time\nand distance, the strange and rather unwelcome surroundings that\nbegan to expand as my range of vision increased ; free to get into com-\nmunication with \" dead \" people whom I had known on this earth.\nThere was a marked feeling of disappointment, not so much at\nleaving this earth as of a sense of banality or commonplaceness in\nthe earth I was approaching ; an earth which was, unexpectedly,\nfar inferior to the vague conception of heaven or a future life I had\nhitherto entertained. Put very bluntly, it did not come up to\nexpectations!\nSimultaneously with this feeling was a partially compensating\nsense that this was not the end, merely the beginning of another life\nin which, somehow, I should not be entirely separated from those\nwhom I was leaving on this earth (though they wotdd be from me),\nand in which I was just about to rejoin several who had previously\ndeparted from me by death. In other words I felt that the new\napproaching life was a mere continuation (in not very pleasant\ncircumstances) of what was ending here. This was, perhaps, my\nmost vivid sensation\u2014satisfaction at the supreme certainty that Life\ndid not end on this earth.\nI also felt a keen sense of wonderment at what was approaching,\nvaguely comparable to the feeling of entering a new school. Mingled,\nhowever, with this was a curious feeling of self-consciousness and\nsurprise at finding myself still my present age, and not entirely\nunfamiliar with my rapidly approaching new surroundings.\nThese impressions and sensations, objectively imposed on my\nmind, I have just strung together as best I can. My keenest recollec-\ntion is that of reaching the very bottom of the shaft and feeling that\nit was my moral duty to make an effort to return to earth. To\ndescribe this, however, would be to deal with subjective matter\n(concerning my conscience, etc.) which I have tried throughout to\navoid.\nIMAGES OF THE SELF\nWe have received only three letters describing images of the self\nseen in dreams, and no description of such an image seen otherwise\nthan in dream, during seven weeks following the last issue of the\nJournal. In this, it will be remembered, there was printed an\naccount of a clearly visualised and externalised self-image, seen by\n\f166 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Mabch-April 1940\nBaroness de Kakucs iu a state of consciousness somewhat resembling\nthat in which hypnogogic pictures are commonly formed, though in\nthis case sleep did not follow, and the experience was in other ways\nunlike that of the typical hypnogogic dream. Considering the\nquestion put by Professor H. H. Price in his Presidential Address,\nwhether images of the self are not extremely rare, we suggested that\nmembers should send notes of any similar experiences that might be\nknown to them. There has been, at any rate, no resjionse from our\nmembers suggesting that such experiences can be regarded as\ncommon.\nIndeed, two of the correspondents who write of visualising them-\nselves in dreams speak with considerable doubt on the question\nwhether they have dreamed of true self-images (in the visual sense)\nor only of figures \" known \", in the dream, to be themselves. The\nthird correspondent describes a clear dream-picture of himself\n\u2014\nseen standing on a ladder, and wearing a hat ;\nbut he,\nagain, expresses a feeling of doubt whether the figure was visually\nidentified as that of himself or only \" known \" to be himself. It\nwould appear that self-images observed in dreams are presentations\nwhich, like dream-presentations of other people, shade off from\nvisual verisimilitude into a mere impression of the dream-personality,\ncoupled with a visual image which may be vague or, in some cases,\nabsurdly unlike the person \" knowm \" to be represented. The\ndream-mind is not, in fact, very often concerned with verisimilitude.\nThe result, so far, of inquiry from our members is that no case has\nbeen reported which resembles the experience of Baroness de\nKakucs in presenting an image of the self that can be identified by\nform and feature or by other visible characteristics.\nCORRESPONDENCE\nSir,\u2014Among the many points of interest raised by Professor\nPrice in his recent Presidential Address, one at least is perhaps\ncapable of receiving some light from experience. Professor Price\nurges the importance of getting accurate descriptions of what the\nsubject experiences in extra-sensory perception. It would be best,\nhe says, if the experimenter himself could have these experiences\nand particularly if psychologists and philosophers could have them,\nfor they would know exactly what points to look out for and how to\ncompare the supernormal with the normal sensory experience. In\nthis way we should accumulate material for building a hypothesis\nof the extra-sensory process.\n\fMarch-April 1940 Correspondence 167\nUnfortunately the excellent plan seems to be fraught with diffi-\nculty. The indications occurring in my work with Miss G. M.\nJolmson (which I give for what they are worth) tend to show that\nwe are forced to deal with two separate states of consciousness, one\nbelonging to the extra-sensory experience and the other to normal\nsensory experience, and that the liaison between them is of the\nsKghtest, so that the critical faculty cannot be carried over from\none to the other.\nIn January 1936, Miss Johnson read a paper to the S.P.R., which\nwas specially designed to describe her experiences during the process\nof acquiring extra-sensory knowledge. This paper was not pub-\nlished, which is perhaps to be regretted, since any facts which serve\nas a guide in our present necessarily wild state of theorising are not\nto be despised. She laid stress on the fact that her extra-sensory\nknowledge lies in a separate compartment of consciousness from her\nnormal knowledge ; and she gave examples. A typical and common\nexperience of hers is that of meeting a person without an appoint-\nment. She will turn up unexpectedly where that person is and while\nthat person is wishing to find her. When this happens, she does not\nhave the experience of entertaining a proposition in her conscious\nmind, such as, ''I know that A is now at the place X and I must\ntherefore go to X to find him or her \". (I do not know whether\nher state of mind can strictly be called cognitive \".) If she is in\npossession of \" knowledge \", that knowledge exists in a parallel\nand separate compartment of consciousness and not in her normal\nconsciousness. She experiences an urge or inclination to go to the\nplace X, coupled with something comparable with a visual image\nof A, which is somehow linked with the idea of X. But it must\nnot be thought that the image of A stands in the same relation to\nconscious thought as does an image called up by the imagination.\nIt is not in a position to be scrutinised or analysed ; moreover she\nsays that the whole experience happens in a flash. (I think however\nthat the urge may be continuous.) To use her own words, she\n\" sees A at the back of her mind \". The point is that none of the\nexperience\u2014urge or image\u2014occurs in that part of the consciousness\nwhich can be subjected to critical analysis, so that a trained psycho-\nlogist, having the experience, would be little better off than an\namateur. It sometimes happens that, while this extra-sensory\nexperience is going on, a parallel process of logical deduction is\ngoing on in the normal part of the consciousness. Thus, while\n\" knowing \" extra-sensorily that A is at X, Miss Johnson may be\nreasoning that he is much more likely to be at Y : and she may\nactually go to Y, still \" knowing \" extra-sensorUy that he is at X.\n\f168 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Maech-Apkil 1940\nHere the two conscious fields would appear to be independent. But\nit sometimes happens that a partial piece of extra-sensory \" know-\nledge \" will finish as a logical train of reasoning in the conscious\nmind, and thus, although starting correctly, may end in a false\nconclusion. This gives evidence of a certain amount of bridging\nbetween the two states of consciousness. It also suggests what\nprobably occm^s when the pronouncement of a genuine sensitive\nturns out to be wrong.\nThe suggestion that the extra-sensory faculty might be brought\nunder control may therefore be impracticable in principle : or it\nmay be practicable only after the application of a difficult technique.\nPerhaps this conclusion does not sound very helpful : yet the mere\nknowledge that important cognitive processes of some sort are\ngoing on in a department of the mind separated from normal con-\nsciousness (but comprised within the same personality), may help\nto fill in the perspective for a psychical theory. It may turn out\nthat normal consciousness, with its own range of concepts, is not\nso much in the centre of things as we thought but, rather, is a\nhighly speciahsed by-product evolved for dealing with an odd\nlittle corner of the universe called the \" physical world \".\nIt would seem to be essential that as many workers as possible\nshould examine the subjective experiences of sensitives with the\nimportance of theory in view. The present vogue of statistical\nresearch does not encourage this, since it places all the importance\non the results and none on the process. But the subjective exper-\niences of a reliable subject, vivid and impressive as they are, do in\nthemselves constitute evidence for the supernormal, which it would\nbe iinreasonable to ignore.\nYoiirs, etc., G. N. M. Tyrrell.\nEvidence of Survival and of Telepathy between the Living\nDear Sir,\u2014Part 150 of Proceedings has, it seems to me, brought\nto the fore a somewhat curious and paradoxical situation.\nOn the one hand we have the very striking material presented in\nMr Thomas' paper on his proxy sittings ^\n\u2014so difficult to account\nfor, in fact, that even Professor Dodds seems to be rather \" stimiped\"\nin his efforts to explain it. In fact, his only alternative suggestion\nis that the supernormal information undoixbtedly displayed was\n* \" A Proxy Experiment of Significant Success,\" Proc, Vol. XLV, p. 157.\n\fMaech-Apeil 1940 Correspondence 169\nobtained by unconscious telepathic transfer from persons at great\ndistances\u2014persons who were not thinking of the facts at the time,\nand even unaware (specifically) of the progress of the experiments.\nOn the other hand we have the negative results in simple tele-\npathy reported by Professor Thouless! ^ In these it was found that\nthe greatest difficulty was experienced in securing even the faintest\nindications of telepathy\u2014and this when both agent and percipient\nwere actively co-operating ; when the information to be conveyed\nwas vividly in the mind of the agent, and when the time-element\nwas obviously the same for both. (This difficulty in obtaining\npositive results has, seemingly, been noted also by Mr Soal and\nothers, in their recent tests.)\nNow the point is this : If telepathy be such a universal, free-and-\neasy process, as postulated by Professor Dodds, why does it not\nevidence itself in the telepathic experiments ? And if it be as rare\nand difficult a process as the telepathic experiments seem to indicate,\nhow is it that it manifests itself so easily and with such enormous\ncomplexity in the spiritistic experiments ?\nOne cannot both have one's cake and eat it ; and this seems to\nbe a case in point. Surely (to vary the metaphor) there must be a\n\" nigger in the wood-pile \" somewhere!\nOf course, it may be contended that Mrs Leonard's \" subliminal\n\"\nis a very rare one, capable of acquiring such information in a way\nquite impossible to the \" normal \" person. (It is this ability, in\nfact, which constitutes her a medium.) But this is tantamoimt to\nsaying that the ability to obtain supernormal information is like-\nwise rare, and that only few subjects possess it. . . . Yet when this\nvery point is emphasised by experimenters in E.S.P., they are im-\nmediately accused of subterfuge, and the assumption made that, if\ntelepathy be a fact, it should be capal^le of demonstration by any-\none at any time\u2014as witness the remark by Professor Thouless that\n\" if E.S.P. is a genuine phenomenon, it is to be hoped that investi-\ngators of it Avill so standardise the conditions that the results can be\nrepeated in any laboratory \".\nIf special psychic ability is necessary in order to obtain spiritistic\n(telepathic) information, why should it not be necessary in order to\nensure significant E.S.P. results? Aiid if it is a mere excuse, and\nnot reaUy necessary, in the E.S.P. tests, then why isn't everyone a\nmedium? Either outstanding psychic abihty is rare or it isn't : if\nit is, why not grant this in telepathic experiments? If not, then\nwhy aren't the E.S.P. tests more successful?\n1 \" Report on Glasgow Repetition of Dr Rhine's Experiments on Extra-\nSensory Perception,\" ibid., p. 252.\n\f170 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Maech-April 1940\nAssuredly it is easy to \" standardise the conditions \", but unfor-\ntunately that is not the main problem involved. The problem is to\n\" standardise \" the psychic faculties of the participants in the\nexperiments\u2014a very different matter! I am quite convinced, from\npersonal experience, that there is an element in E.S.P. tests which\ndoes not and probably never will lend itself to statistical analysis,\nmuch as this may be regretted. And this element is the most\nimportant one involved, being in fact the whole crux of the matter.\nLet me give an illustration of this.\nOn numerous occasions I have tried experiments in E.S.P., using\nthe regular Zener cards while doing so. The results were always\n\" chance \". During the afternoon of March 6, 1937, some friends\ncame in to tea, and I tried again, with the usual results. Soon after\nthey had gone, however, I said to my wife, \" I feel psychic! Let's\ntry some tests now! \" We tried five runs through the pack of\ncoloured Zener cards, I acting as percipient. During these trials\nmy correct \" hits \" were ; 9, 13, 13, 18, 12. Ifelt that I was getting\nthe cards correctly, whereas on all previous occasions I had felt\nthat I was merely guessing. This feeling of uncertainty was noted on\nall subsequent occasions, when my averages again fell to \" chance \".\nNow, on this particular occasion, I am convinced, something hap-\npened inside me which rendered such success possible\u2014which opened\na door, so to speak, to telepathic impressions. What it was that\nhappened, and what this Door may be, I have not, of course, the\nghost of an idea. But I am also convinced that, if we knew this,\nwe should have gone a long way toward understanding the secret of\ntelepathic transfer\u2014and perhaps even more startling psychic\nphenomena.\nThe point I wish to make, however, is that this peculiar subjec-\ntive condition is not subject to laboratory control or to statistical\ntreatment. It is rare and spontaneous, linking it to the dramatic\nand striking \" spontaneous \" cases, which seemingly illustrate the\nsame inner mechanism, quite beyond the voluntary control of the\nsubject.\nEmotion plays a major role in all such spontaneous cases, and I\nam convinced that it is largely due to the absence of this emotional\nfactor that experimental cases fall so far short of the spontaneous\nones, in all telepathic experiences.\nI fully realise that all this must prove highly exasperating to the\nmathematician ; but that is part of the penalty he must pay for\nbecoming a psychical researcher!\nTo return once more to the point raised at the beginning of this\nletter : Professor Dodds frankly acknowledges that there are only\n\fMaech-April 1940 Correspondence 171\ntwo conceivable theories capable of accounting for the facts con-\ntained in the Thomas proxy sittings. These are (a) the telepathic,\nand {b) the spiritistic. All others he raises only to dismiss them ;\nand in this he agrees with Hodgson, Hyslop, Lodge and many others\nwho have discussed similar cases. Professor William McDougall,\nalso, in summing-up his impressions of the material contained in\nJohn E. Thomas' book Beyond Human Cogniiion, stated that the\nalternatives seemed to lie between some extensive and hitherto im-\nproved type of telepathy, and genuine spirit communication. The\nalternatives seem to be much the same here.\nWithout in any way attempting to decide this question, two\npoints may, I think, be made in conclusion. These are :\n(1) Dr Hodgson, in working with Mrs Piper, tried the telepathic\nhypothesis for ten years, and the spiritistic hypothesis for another\nten years, and came to the deliberate conclusion that the latter was\njustified, while the former Avas not.\n(2) Those who reject telepathy, or refuse to accept it as a vera\ncausa, are left with no other alternative but spiritualism. If there\nbe but two alternatives, and one of these be rejected, the other\nmust be accepted. For, as I said in a lecture, some time ago, before\nthe Anthropology class at Columbia University (which had tried to\ndiscredit Rhine's work), \" You had jolly well better believe in tele-\npathy, because if you don't there is no possible escape from spiritual-\nism as an explanation of the phenomena!\n\"\nI don't think they liked it very much, but it is the truth never-\ntheless. The rarer such telepathic \" faculties \" are shown to be,\nthe more striking and convincing do the seemingly spiritistic\nmessages become.\nIn all this, of course, I am not contending that the spiritistic\ninterpretation is necessarily the true one. I am merely endeavour-\ning to emphasise the weaknesses of the alternative explanations.\nTime alone will tell which interpretation is correct.\nYours, etc.,\nHereward Carrington.\nCriticisms of Reviews\nMoses and Monotheism\nSir,\u2014In the Proceedings for December 1939 (Part 160, Vol.\nXLV) the reviewer of Professor Freud writes, His undeviating\nsearch for truth . . . has never been surpassed in the history of\n\f172 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Maech-April 1940\nscience (page 346). On the opposite page is a review of Professor\nFreud's book Moses and Monotheism.\nNow a good deal of archaeological evidence has come to light that\nbears both on Moses and Monotheism. It contradicts Professor\nFreud's conclusions. For example, Moses died before Ikhnaton's\nreign. Monotheism goes back long before Ikhnaton's time.\nThe contents of Professor Freud's book are a series of ingenious\nspeculations on the part, of himself and other people. But, to use\nthe language of our Society, this is not \" veridical \". We demand\nrigorous evidence in psychical matters. How comes it that Professor\nFreud's speculations about Moses and Monotheism are to be\nexempted, and to be dignified with the honoured name of science?\nWhy strain at gnats in Psychical Research when we swallow camels\nelsewhere ?\nYours very truly, Charles Marston.\n(Sir Charles Marston has explained, on inquiry, that the view of the\nhistorical evidence assumed in the above letter is that expressed in his\nbook.

Bendit, in which occurs the\nfollowing passage :\n\" This book is not by any means a scientific\none in the narrow sense : no proofs are offered. That is an aspect\nof research which can, however, well be left to the mechanised type\nof psychic researcher, who has in the past done much reliable work,\nif only by elimination, in establishing the occurrence of para-\npsychological phenomena. Nowadays, however, when all but the\n'\nclosed '\nmind accepts these as facts, this book offers something of\ngreater interest, which is a record of what is obviously real experi-\nence.\"\nThe writer of this passage is, of course, alone responsible for it.\nNevertheless, may I be allowed to say, in most restrained language,\nthat I think it somewhat ill-judged? What the writer means by\nscientific \" in the narrow sense \" I do not know. Nor do I know\nhow a book on psychical research in which no proofs are offered\n\"\ncan be scientific in any sense. In the next sentence \" reliable \" is\npresumably a misprint for \" valuable \" ; but what on earth is \" the\nmechanised type of psychic researcher \"? The context appears to\nimply that the writer means by this the type of researcher who\n\" establishes \" the reality of phenomena by \" eliminating \" error\n\fMarch-Apkil 1940 Correspondence 173\nand fraud. Is it seriously suggested that this type of investigation\nwas useful only \" in the past \" and that \" nowadays \" this kind of\nwork is superfluous?\nIn the following sentence, what are \" these \" parapsychological\nphenomena which \" all \" \" but the '\nclosed '\nmind accepts \"? The\nbook under review (of which I know nothing and which is not in\nquestion so far as this letter is concerned), we are told, \" offers\nsomething of greater interest \" than paraiDsychological phenomena\n(this is what the writer says, but he means, I think, something of\ngreater interest than \" mechanised \" investigation). How then\nare the experiences recorded in it \" obviously \" real? The writer\nis of course quite entitled to use his intuition rather than his critical\nfaculties in reviewing books\u2014but not dogmatically to assert, as a\ngeneral principle, the superiority of the former over the latter as a\nmethod of research.\nYours, etc.,\nTheodore Besterman.\n(Dr. Bendit's views are, of course, his own ; but the question has\nbeen raised by others, and notably by the President, whether\npsychical research should not go beyond the establishment of fact\nto the construction of theory for its better comprehension.

By E. L. Megroz. John Lane. 10s. 6d. net.\nMr Megroz has made an interesting survey of the position of\nthe dream in the estimation of civihzed people, from early\ndays up to the present, and prints many records of dreams of\ndifferent kinds. While Mr de la Mare's recent work. Behold, this\nDreamer, represents the literary and poetic quality of dreaming\nand of dream-inspiration, Mr Megroz may be said to have represented\nthe status of dreaming, as it has been regarded by observant and\nmore or less thoughtful people. It is of interest to note that modern\nviews of dream-psychology, including that of psycho-analysis, are\nnot so foreign to the views of early commentators as might have\nbeen expected, and that old interpretations of the significance of\ndreaming have been by no means confined to fanciful and super-\nstitious patterns.\nA proportion of the general interest in dreams is concerned with\nthose that have, or seem to have, a paranormal character, and this\nproportion is fairly represented in the examples that Mr Megroz has\nchosen. He is not concerned with the question of strict evidence for\nparanormality in dreaming, his general plan being rather to survey\nthe field of human regard for dreams than to criticise any views that\nmay be held. Psychical research workers may wish that para-\nnormal dreams had been included for which more definite and\naccurate evidence could be adduced, but the setting-out of such\nevidence is an elaborate and often a cumbrous business, some-\nwhat outside the scope of a book of this kind, not primarily\nintended for students of psychical matters. The value of the work\nlies in the conspectus that it provides of dream-activity in many\naspects, and in the very readable and often acute commentary with\nwhich Mr Megroz has strung his material together.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS\nRevue Metaphysique.

Gibson,\nwho is known to Members in connexion with the investigation of\nE.S.P. in the United States.)\nOn July 19, 1935, Mrs Gibson and myself were testing Mr J. H.\nfor extra-sensory perception. Previous to this time he had produced\ninteresting automatism. His ability to produce poetry spontaneously\nand rapidly by means of the Ouija board had intrigued us and when\nthe opportunity offered, we decided to test him with E.S.P. cards.\nThe cards used for this experiment were several packs of E.S.P,\n\fMay-June 1940 Case : The Missing Water Valvt 179\ncards, prepared by hand-stamping upon playing card l)lanks. They\nwere quite free from marking and other discernible sensory-cues\nand were examined before and after the experiment. In 350 trials\nusing the technique of Open Matching, J. H. made 192 hits or an\naverage of 13.72 hits per 25. Mean chance expectation would have\nbeen 5 hits per 25. During the experiment he directed the placing\nof some of the cards from across the room, where he walked slowly\nback and forth in what seemed a semi-dissociated state. A few\nruns were made while he sat at a table, with eyes apparently closed,\nindifferent to remarks in the room, choosing the pile and dealing\nspasmodically. There appeared to be no difference between the\nruns made at the table and the runs in which Mrs Gibson laid the\ncards for him from across the room. He was permitted to shuffle\nthe pack during the first and second runs but when the high scoring\ntendency manifested with the second run, the shuffling and card con-\ntrol was taken from his hands. His first 8 runs with this procedure\nnetted the following number of hits : 5, 19, 21, 15, 23, 20, 20, 12.\nThis series was quite astounding, the apparent E.S.P. ability\nsurpassing any demonstration made by other subjects. It was\ndecided to test him in a practical manner if possible to see whether\nwhat we had witnessed could be turned to useful ends.\nAt the time of this experiment, I was employed as City Engineer\nof East Grand Rapids, Michigan. It occurred that he might be\ntested in a manner which might settle a problem which had been\nperplexing the local water department.\nFor over a year, that department had been searching for an\nunrecorded and lost valve on a large water service feeding a large\nestate outside of the municipal limits. The amount of water being\nused was considerable, there had been arguments about meter\nreadings, and it was important that the valve be located. Search of\nthe parkway and pavement with a dipping needle had failed to\nyield anything and there were no municipal records indicating\nwhere the valve might be found.\nAt the close of J. H.'s test in open matching, he was asked as to\nthe location of the lost valve, the property and street intersection\nbeing described to him roughly. He asked what there was near by\nfrom which such a valve might be located and it was suggested that\nthe corner boundary post of the estate would serve. J. H. then\nslipped again into the semi-dissociated state which resembled that of\nlight hypnotic trance. Then he said sleepily :\n\" I get sixty-four feet.\"\nQuestioned as to the direction from the pillar in which the valve-\nbox would be found, he said that he had no feehng as to direction\n\f180 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May-June 1940\nbut a feeling as to sixty-four feet. As we were intrigued that J. H.\nwould tackle such an impossible task, the test was described to a\nwitness ^ in a letter dated July 20th and a sketch of the estate was\nsent him, showing the wide frontage and the direction in which I\nassumed the missing valve box must lie.-\nOn August 5, 1935, after fruitless searching in various places, the\npavement was broken in four places in hope of uncovering something\nand the missing valve was found four and one-half feet below the\npavement of Plymouth Road, the extension box which would have\nextended to the pavement surface never having been installed. The\nbox had been paved over and had been forgotten.\nThe valve was found sixty-three feet almost due south of the centre\nof the corner pillar of the estate. This is within one foot of the\ndimension given by J. H. on the night of July 20. Throughout it had\nbeen my assumption that the valve would 1)6 found somewhere east\nor south-east of the corner pillar and inasmuch as the estate was\nfive hundred feet in width, a wide latitude in possible locations\nseemed to exist.\nThe service in question was installed in the winter of 1914-1915.\nThe superintendent who was in charge of the construction was dead.\nOne of the labourers who had worked on the installation was foimd\nafter the guess of J. H. was made and he suggested opening Plymouth\nRoad instead of hunting further in Robinson Road where our early\nsearch had been made. The suggested location pointed out by this\nman proved to be ten feet away from the location where the valve\nwas finally found.\nPlymouth Road was paved with concrete in 1927 and no valve\nindications or signs of a trench had been in existence since that\nperiod. J. H. did not come to Grand Rapids to live until 1929.\nNormal knowledge of the valve location would be impossible for him.\nThe whole perceptive incident took place at my home, five miles air\nline distance from the location discussed. The topic was brought up\non the spur of the moment.\nTwo hypotheses offer themselves in this case. (1) The location of\nthe valve measurement so closely was merely fortuitous and a case\nof coincidence. (2) The other theory is that extra-sensory perception\noperated in some manner so as to furnish J. H. with a distance\nmeasurement to the missing shut-off. In the light of his E.S.P.\nscoring which occurred coincidentally, I am inclined to favour the\n1 Known to the Society. We have due confirmation that the incident was\nput on record as described.\n^ Mr Gibson's report to the Society is accompanied by a scale plan, which\ncan be seen at the Society's Rooms.\n\fMay-Juxxe 1940 Case : The Missing Water Valve 181\nlatter hypothesis. Inasmuch as no one could offer definite informa-\ntion as to the location from memory, clairvoyance seems more\ntenable than telepathy as an explanation.\nThe case may have some kind of relationship to the dowsing\nexperiments as I remember reported or made by Sir William F.\nBarrett and Theodore Besterman in which the dowser worked\nfrom maps, locating the water source thereon. In this case, the\nmeasurement was given with fair accuracy after a description of the\nlocality, known by sight to J. H., had been given him. The weakest\npart of the evidence is that J. H. failed to give us any idea of a\ndirection, insisting merely on the figure of sixty-four feet. The\nactual measurement was sixty-two feet to the pillar face and sixty-\nthree feet to the centre of the pillar.\nEdmond p. Gibson.\nIn further correspondence Mr Gibson makes it clear that, as his\ndescription implies, the actual discovery of the missing valve was\nmade by the local water engineers without making use of the measure-\nment given by the percipient in this case. Mr Gibson adds a piece\nof information which helps to define the improbability that know-\nledge concerning the missing valve could somehow have reached the\npercipient by normal channels :\n\" Inasmuch as the measurement was not used by the city em-\nployees as a guide, they continued to dig holes on the best information\nnormally available, that of the workman who was found to have\nworked on the watermain project in 1914-1915 and who remembered\nthat a trench had been dug in Plymouth Road to connect the\nproperty, inasmuch as the main in Robinson Road in front of the\nproperty at that time was not yet complete and without water.\nMr J. H. had no knowledge of this workman and it was after\nconsiderable detective work on my part early in August ^ that he\nwas discovered.\"\nFREAK BRIDGE HANDS :\nAnd their relevance to Tests of Significance in\nPsychical Research\nBy W. Whately Carington\nI have been asked to comment on the fact (of which there seems to\nbe no reasonable doubt) that Bridge deals yielding four hands each\ncontaining 13 cards of the same suit occur with a frequency such\n^ i.e. some weeks after the experiment in which the measurement was given.\n\f182 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May-June 1940\nthat the odds against it would be of an \" astronomical \" order, if\nchance alone were responsible^.\nMany people seem to feel that this kind of thing throws doubt on\nthe apphcability of probability theory and statistical methods to\npsychical research. But this is not the I think can be made\nclear by a simple and non-mathematical discussion.\nThe argument seems to be substantially as follows :\n\" It is\nclaimed that certain events (e.g. reproductions of drawings or\nguessings of cards) observed in experiments occur with a frequency\nsuch that the odds against their being due to chance are very\ngreat : and from this it is argued that some '\nparanormal '\ncause\nmust be invoked to explain them. But even more improbable\nevents occur under the chance conditions of shuffled packs at bridge\ntables, where there seems no question of anything paranormal\nbeing involved at all. And if these normal events violate the\nsupposed '\nlaws of chance ', then it looks as if the laws were wrong,\nor at least not inviolable. Why then should we not attribute the\nexperimental events to imperfections in these laws rather than to\nparanormal causes?\n\"\nThe weakness lies in the assumption that bridge table conditions\nare chance conditions in the mathematical sense. If they are not,\nthe probability calculations are not applicable, and the whole\nargument falls to the ground ; for probabiUty theory, like every\nother mathematical procedure, depends on the validity of its\nassumptions, and if these be unjustified in any practical situation\nthe theoretical treatment will not apply.\nNow a pack which is well enough shuffled for the purposes of the\ngame is by no means necessarily \" well-shuffled \" in the sense\nassumed by the mathematician. On the contrary, both the nature\nof the game and the methods of shuffling most commonly used, tend\ntowards facilitating the type of freak hands we are considering.\nAs a deliberately simplified example, suppose that the dealer\npicks up four perfect (one-suit) tricks, in any order, and gives them\ntwo perfect \" fantail \" shuffles, thus twice alternating the cards of one\nhalf with those of the other half. We should then have\nFirst arrangement : AAAABBBBCCCCDDDD\nSecond \u201e ACACACACBDBDBDBD\nThird \u201e ABCDABCDABCDABCD\nwhich would be dealt to the four players as AAAA, BBBB, CCCC,\nDDDD, tending towards the type of hand here discussed.\n1 Cf, for example, a letter and note in the Daily Telegraph for April 14th,\n1940.\n\fMay-June 1940 Freak Bridge Hands 183\nIt is clear that if this kind of thing happens in any part of the pack\nit will to that extent (which may well be large) reduce the size of\nthe remainder of the pack to be brought into the required order by\nrandom shuffling. But, from what we know of the nature of the\ngame and the methods of shuffling usually adopted, we may be\npretty sure\u2014as I am confident most players would agree\u2014that\nsomething of this sort, in greater or less degree, is hkely to be the\nrule rather than the exception ; so that, in general, there will be a\ndefinite tendency towards the dealing of hands of this type.\nThus the assumptions on which the mathematical treatment is\nbased will not in general be vahd, and the apparently too frequent\noccurrence of four hands of thirteen of a suit need not surprise us.\nThe only relevance of this to psychical research is as a reminder\nthat, in addition to guarding against such sources of error as sensory\nclues and fraud, we must also satisfy ourselves that those conditions\nare fulfilled which correspond to the randomness of a shuffled pack\nassumed by probabihty theory in card problems.\nCORKESPONDENCE\nSir,\u2014Professor Broad's Introduction to Mr Whately Carington's\nand Mr goal's papers in the current Part of Proceedings raises several\npoints which psychical researchers woidd do well carefully to ponder.\nMay I be permitted to make a few comments on two points, namely,\n(1) the position of the scientific expert in psychical research, and\n(2) the relation between quantitative and quahtative investigation\nof paranormal cognition ?\nIn the first place, it is important to emphasize that psychical\nresearch has a technique of its own. The principles underlying this\ntechnique are in themselves simple, but not always easy to apply in\nthe varying circumstances arising in the course of any psychical\ninvestigation. Success in applying them depends largely on experi-\nence. Until these principles have been mastered and the necessary\nexperience in applying them has been gained, any person engagmg\nin psychical research, however distinguished he may be in science or\nin any other walk of life, must be considered an amateur.\nThe closer the connection between the expert in psychical research\nand the expert in whatever branch of learning is specially relevant\nto any particular investigation, the more satisfactory the results\nwill be. There are two stages of an investigation at which the\npsychical researcher may wish to call in the expert in some other\nstudy, first, in devising and putting into effect a system of control\n\f184 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May-June 1940\nso as to eliminate deception, normal leakage, or whatever in that\nparticular case may be the clanger to be guarded against, and\nsecondly in evaluating the results. The same expert and same\ntechnique may happen to be of use at both stages and for both pur-\nposes, but this is not necessarily so.\nTo take, for example, the study of physical phenomena, the first\nneed for the researcher in charge of the investigation is to know how\nto take precautions against deception, mal-observation, etc., and it\nis important that as an aid to that technique he should also be\nfamiliar with the electrical and photographic technique to which\nProfessor Broad refers : the Society is indeed fortunate in having a\nResearch Officer so well qualified in both these respects. When,\nhowever, it comes to evaluating the results it may be necessary to\ncall in aid expert knowledge of the most diverse kind. To take two\nnotable recent instances, in the later stages of Rudi Schneider's\nmediumship, expert knowledge of the use of infra-red rays was\nrequired ;\nin the later stages of the Margery mediumship, what was\nneeded was expert knowledge of thumbprints. A well-known\nmedium of the last generation produced a wide range of apports,\nincluding the freshly laid eggs of exotic birds and cuneiform tablets\nfrom Ancient Mesopotamia, or so it was claimed. As it is improbable\nthat any Admirable Crichton will be found who will add to expertise\nin psychical research a profound knowledge of physics, dermo-\nglyphics, ornithology, Assyriology and whatnot, it seems probable\nthat the best results will be achieved by a close co-operation between\npsychical researcher and scientist, each being content to be an expert\nat his own job, with sufficient knowledge, if possible, of his partner's\njob to render their co-operation fruitful.\nThe real difficulty, however, in the investigation of physical\nphenomena has for long seemed to me to be, not the psychical\nresearcher's lack of scientific knowledge or assistance, so much as\nrefusal by a large number of mediums to submit to adequate\ncontrol, whether of the technical or non-technical kind. The first\nforward move would appear to be of what one may call a political\nrather than a technical nature, namely, an agreement between all\npersons seriously interested in this line of investigation to have\nnothing to do with, and to take no notice in their publications of any\nmediums who refuse to accept adequate control. In connection\nwith mental phenomena somewhat similar conditions obtain,\nexcept that normal leakage of an innocent kind, rather than decep-\ntion, is the principal danger towards which the control system must\nbe directed.\nProfessor Broad says of non-statistical investigation of para-\n\fMay-June 1940 Correspondence 185\nnormal cognition \" experience shows that it leaves most plain men\nand scientists completely unmoved \". As regards the reactions of\nplain men my experience in addressing a good number of Societies\nand Clubs of one's ordinary fellow citizens emboldens me to disagree\nwith Prof. Broad ; I find them a great deal impressed by phenomena\nof the kind collected in \" Phantasms of the Living \" and the Census\nof Hallucinations '\",\nand also by such experiments of a non-statistical\nkind in telepathy and clairvoyance as they may have heard of. The\ntrouble is that they are as much impressed with badly documented\nand badly evidenced cases as with good ones. Few books connected\nwith psychical research have made as much impression on the\ngeneral public as J. W. Dunne's \" An Experiment with Time \" and\nthe book known as An Adventure \"\",\nboth of which, whatsoever\ntheir other points of interest, fall much below S.P.R. evidential\nstandards. The plain man. though probably aware of the general\ntruth that \" what the soldier said is not evidence '\",\ndoes not know\nor at any rate does not bear in mind, those rules regardmg contem-\nporary record, corroboration, etc., which experience has taught us to\nbe necessary.\nAs regards the establishment of the facts, therefore, the plain man\nneeds guidance. As to the evaluation of the facts with reference to\nthe likehhood or otherwise of their being attributable to chance-\ncoincidence, I greatly doubt whether the ]Aan\\ man of average\nintelligence goes very far astray. It is the sort of problem which he\nis constantly confronted with in his everyday life, and his success or\nfailure in life depends largely on the decisions he makes when so\nconfronted. I would, in fact, back his judgment against that of the\nscientist, unless the scientist happens also to be a member of our\nSociety, because the plain man judges without any bias against the\nparanormal explanation, and the specialised training of the scientist\ntends to make him rely on criteria which may have no validity in\nconnection with our subject.\nSo with the non-statistical experiments reported in our Proceedings\nand Journal. It is the fact that some of these were not conducted\nunder strict control conditions, reliance being placed (justly, in the\ncircumstances of the time) on the bona fides of the persons par-\nticipating in the experiment. The present generation, accustomed\nas it is to breach of faith on a scale and in circumstances that our\nfathers could hardly have imagined, naturally demands that\nexperiments should be framed in such a way that the issue of bona\nfides does not arise. But on the issue of chance or non-chance,\nwhich is an entirely separate one, the non-statistical ex^jeriments\nseem to be as conclusive as any statistical experiments so far reported.\n\f186 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May-June 1940\nThe case for statistical experiment should therefore, I suggest, not\nbe based on its supposed superiority over non-statistical work,\nbecause in some respects it is inferior, that is to say, less informative,\nbut partly on the desirability of providing a particular type of\nevidence making a special appeal to minds trained in particular\nmethods, and partly on the need for surveying the subject from as\nmany different angles as possible. It would seriously retard advance\nin psychical research if spontaneous phenomena, when properly\nobserved and reported, and experiments not amenable to statistical\nanalysis, when conducted under good control conditions, were to be\nregarded as either obsolete or as of secondary importance to the\nstatistical researches of Mr Carington, Mr Soal and Dr Hettinger,\nwhich we all so greatly admire.\nYours, etc., W. H. Salter.\nThe Study of Psychic Experience\nSir,\u2014I am not sure, in the midst of Mr Besterman's rather confused\nattack, what he is really after. But I suspect that I have touched a\nsore spot in suggesting that psychic research can do something more\nthan to continue in its old routine of collating and collecting (useful\nas this is), and re-proving what has already been proved ad libitum\n(if not ad nauseam) \" beyond all reasonable doubt \". One cannot\nbuild a house without stones. And, of course, the wider the choice\nof them, the better. But to go on piUng stone on stone, even if\neach be marked \" Tested and approved \" is to build, not a house but\na cairn under which lie ever more deeply buried the bones of creative\nunderstanding. But before the material so piled up can be used, a\nmost (in Mr Besterman's view) unscientific process must take place,\nin that the architect must produce from his subjective intuition\nthe concept of the house he wants to build. Only then does his\nmaterial justify itself and come alive.\nIn my opinion, the next step must be the unscientific (Mr Bester-\nman) or meta-scientific (myself) step of approaching psychic\nmaterial from the viewpoint of experience-values, and trying to\nunderstand the subjective psychological meaning of parapsycho-\nlogical happenings to the individual experiencing them. Academic\npsychology opened up an interesting field. But it had no human,\nas distinct from laboratory, value until it became Hnked with\nsubjective experience through Freud in the first place, Jung and\nothers afterwards. The same apphes to psychic research.\nYours, etc., Laurence J. Bendit.\n\fMay-June 1940 Reviews 187\nREVIEWS\nThe Ultra-Perceptive Faculty. By J. Hettinger, Ph.D. Rider ;\npp. 204. 12s. 6d. net.\nWhether we call it the Ultra-perceptive Faculty, or Extra-\nsensory Perception, or non-sensory Cognition, or something \\A^th\nparanormal in it, we should all agree that Dr Hettinger has made a\nvaluable contribution to its study.\nDuring his experiments, which covered the period from May 1934\nto September 1937, Dr Hettinger had the constant advice of Prof.\nAvehng, and on their completion the book was approved by the\nUniversity of London for the award of the degree of Ph.D., a further\nwelcome example of the present wilhngness of academic psychology\nto recognise and assist serious experimental work in psychical\nresearch.\nThe sensitives tested were two professional psychometric mediums\nof good reputation. The objects used were of divers kinds, the only\nstipulation being that they should have been in contact with the\n\" subjects \", that is the persons offering them for the experiments.\nThe subjects were never present at the sittuags, and the sensitives\ndid not know who they were. \" As regards the articles, with very\nfew exceptions they were always enclosed in sealed envelopes and, in\nthe case of one of the sensitives, most of the tests Avere carried out\nwithout her touching the envelopes.\" The presentation of each\nobject resulted in a \" test \", and each statement made by the\nsensitive during a test counted as an \" item \". There were twelve\nseries of experiments ; the total number of tests, each generally\nlasting an hour, was 623, and the total number of statements or\n\" items \" given was 6631.\nAs the subject-matter of the items was free \", and the chance-\nprobability of any item being a hit could not be determined by the\nsimple process available when, e.g., a pack of playing cards is used,\nDr Hettinger had to devise a technique of objective statistical\nassessment applicable to experiments of this kind. He tried various\ntypes of matching, separately or by groups, the items given at one\ntest against those given at other tests, and invited his subjects to\nsay which items they accepted as applicable to themselves, all\nknowledge as to which test the items were given in having, of course,\nbeen kept from them. The diiferent methods are explained by the\nauthor, whose conmaents on the pros and cons of each should be of\ngreat help to other researchers faced with similar problems.\nThe two methods found most useful were (a) that of \" admixed\ncontrol items \" in which the subject was given a List composed, as to\n\f188 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May-June 194C\nhalf, of items given by the sensitive with reference to his object,\nand, as to the other half, of items given by the sensitive on other\noccasions ; and (6) the method of \" paired items \"',\nin which each\nitem given by the sensitive with reference to one subject's object\nwas paired with a control item given with reference to another\nsubject. Under each method the subject was asked to indicate the\nitems which were substantially more applicable to him than the\nothers. For methods of matching to be objective, it is of course\nessential that whoever arranges the grouping or pairing of the items\nshould have no knowledge which of them would be applicable to the\nsubject to whom the list is to be submitted. Dr Hettinger gives his\nreasons for feeling satisfied on this head.\nThe scores so obtained were analysed by statistical methods with\nthe general nature of which psychical researchers are by now fairly\nfamiliar. There is an analysis of each series of experiments and also\nfor the twelve series taken together, and these should be consulted\nin the original text. Suffice it here to say that the analysis gave\nsignificant results suggesting the possession of ultra-perceptive\npowers by each of the two sensitives.\nInteresting chapters are devoted to a classification of the subject-\nmatter of the items, e.g. emotions, actions, personal characteristics,\nrelationships, names, etc., and to a discussion of the time-factor,\nthat is, references to past, present and future events. The author\nnotes that several apparently veridical items related to events\noccurring after the object had left the subject's possession, and\npoints out that this tells against a frequently held view, that in\npsychometry the subject's experiences, while the object is in his\npossession, are registered in the object by means of vibrations, which\nthe sensitive can later read. He did not find in the experiments any\nsubstantial evidence for a paranormal pre-cognitive faculty.\nDr Hettinger considers that as \" with very few exceptions the\nitems perceived were found to form part of the subject's psycho-\nlogical make-up at the time of the test \", telepathy is the most\nplausible explanation, but that any theory of ultra-perceptive\ncognition ought not to exclude clairvoyance. In psychometry the\nobject seems to play an essential part as a connecting link between\nsensitive and subject, but how it does this the author admits he\ncannot explain.\nWe look forward to the account of further experiments which,\nwe understand, Dr Hettinger will shortly be publishing.\nW.

Dr Rhine has relinquished the editorship\nand this is now in the hands of Dr Gardner Murphy of Columbia\nUniversity and Dr Bernard F. Riess of Hunter College, New York\nCity.\nThe December issue contains a long report of experiments by\nPratt and Woodruff designed to test (1) the reality of E.S.P. (2) the\neffect of size of symbols (figures on the cards), (3) the effect of\n\" experience \" of the subject, (4) the effect of newness of material.\nHighly significant scoring was obtained which is claimed by the\nauthors to demonstrate the reality of E.S.P. Neither size of symbols\nnor experience of subject appeared to have any direct relation with\nthe rate of scoring but subjects were found to score significantly\nbetter with new material.\nThe conditions of the experiment are fully reported and great care\nwas taken to exclude the possibility of sensory clues, experimental\nand recording errors. An elaborate system of checking was devised\nin order that the charge of deception could not be sustained against\nthe experimenters and others concerned.\nContrary to the policy hitherto adhered to, the editors have pub-\nlished an article dealing entirely with the theoretical side of the\nsubject. This has been contributed by 0. L. Reiser and is entitled\n\" Theory of Extra-sensory Perception ''.\nThere are four constituent\nelements of the theory, viz. (1) Emergent Evolution, (2) Non-\nAristotelian Logic, (3) the notion of Psychic Levels, (4) Rehgious\nHumanism.\nThe local time of a system is transposable across its parts but not\noutside the system. If the system enters into relations with other\nsystems so as to form an organic whole, a new local time for that\norganism emerges. This is an Emergent Dimension.\nAristotelian Logic and Newtonian Physics, which are founded\nupon it, are inapplicable to an organismic world, their fundamental\nassumptions are invalid and their time is an abstraction from\norganismic time. The rigorous dichotomies, the point-particle aspect\nis lost when a new organic whole emerges.\nOn the new psychic level attained by the organism fresh modes of\npsychic interaction come into play ; thus E.S.P. may be regarded as\nan emergent faculty. To quote from the article :\n\" Evolution is not\nthrough with the human organism, for still higher functions remain\nto be developed.\" \" Humanity thus appears as a god in embryo, a\n\f190 Journal of Society for PsycJiical Research May-June 1940\ndeveloping being with psychic powers\u2014omniscience and omni-\njjresence\u2014which man has hitherto assigned to God.\" This doctrine,\nDr Reiser says, is a form of humanism.\nThe object of this brief sketch is to indicate that Dr Reiser's\narticle merits a careful study by those wlio are interested in the\ntheoretical side of psychical research.\nKennedy and Uphoff contribute a study of Recording Errors and\narrive at the conclusion that these may, in large measure, be respon-\nsible for extra-chance scoring.

The intention of the\ntest would clearly be defeated, if the envelope were opened as soon\nas any claim, however ill-founded, were made that a communication\nrelating to the contents had been received ; the Council accordingly\ndo not propose to be too hasty in opening the envelope.\nThey will be glad to accept the custody of any communication\nwhich those who receive it believe to relate to the contents of Sir\nOliver's envelope, until such time as that is opened, and they would\nsuggest to intending depositors the following procedure. The com-\nmunication should be placed in an envelope on the outside of which\nshoiild be written the date of receij)t, the name of the medium or\nautomatist and other relevant particulars, and this should be placed\ninside a second envelope addressed to the Society. The officials of\nthe Society will thus have no knowledge of the nature of the com-\nmunication until Sir Oliver's envelope is opened, and a further step\nTvill have been taken towards carrying out the main object of the test.\nCORRESPONDENCE\nTo the Editor of The Journal\nSir,\u2014There are several points in the current Journal and Pro-\nceedings on which I should like to comment ; and I hope you will\nallow me to do so, for convenience, in a single letter.\nEirst of all I want to add a brief tribute to the memory of Oliver\nGatty. I worked with him, during our investigation of Rudi\nSchneider, for several hours every day for six months ; and the\npersonality that revealed itself then, and in later association, is one\nI shall always consider it a privilege to have known. Oliver Gatty\nappeared to have every gift : a brilliant, leaping mind, at once open\nand sceptical, daring in its willingness to play wdth new ideas, but\ncautious in not accepting them without the closest examination ;\nthe mental and physical energy which enabled him to acquire\n\fSept.-Oot. 1940 Corresjwndence 193\nspecialised knowledge in a wide range of interests ; an uproarious\nsense of humour ; a gift for friendship ;\noutstanding personal\ncharm. . . . There can seldom have been any young man so clearly\ndestined for great things. He died as he would have wished, as in\nfact he did wish, fighting the things he hated, ugliness, cruelty and\nintolerance.\n^ ^ ^\nI should like to correct a trifling lapse of memory by Mr Gibson\nin the .Journal (p. 181). There is no report in The Divining-Rod of\nany case in which a dowser has located water by working from a\nmap. Nor have I ever succeeded in obtaining good evidence of this\nphenomenon. Published examples of this form of dowsing have\ndoubtful value owing to the unsatisfactory conditions under which\nthey took place. The dowser almost invariably sees the map which\nhe is using and normal map-reading is therefore not excluded.\nProfessor Broad writes {Proceedings, xlvi. 27) that experience shows\nthat a non-statistical report of a paranormal phenomenon \" leaves\nmost plain men and scientists completely unmoved \" (Dr Bendit,\nplease note). I would not lightly disagree with any dictum of Pro-\nfessor Broad, even with the accent on the obiter, but I respectfully\nsubmit that experience shows nothing of the sort. I go further than\nMr Salter {Joiirnal, pp. 184-5), for I do not think that the state-\nment is true even of most scientists. Everyone has met the\n\" scientist \" who says, \" I can't explain just how this was done,\nbut of course it must have been faked.\"' And I am sure that I\ncannot be the only one who has heard a statistician say, \" I can't\njust put my finger on the flaw in these figures, but of course there\nmust be one.\" Even the ablest statistician knows himself capable\nof serious slips in this tight-rope science (cp. successive editions of\nstatistical textbooks), and therefore feels himself justified in falling\nback on undetected error if he is a determined or lazy sceptic, that\nis, if he is typical. Such, at any rate, is my experience, and it is\nalso my experience that the only thing really capable of making\nthe average person sit up, be he plain man or scientist, is a good\nknock-down \" experience \" of the natural history era. I do not\ndefend this attitude\u2014it is most certainly unscientific\u2014but I do\nstate it as a fact which the S.P.R. must take into account in framing\nits research.\nI have read Mr Carington's new report {Proceedings, xlvi. 34 ff.)\nwith the close attention so important a contribution deserves, and\nI have been struck by an apparent omission from the admirably\nminute description of his experimental procedure. Mr Carington\nm2\n\f194 Journal of Society for Psychical Research .Sept. -Oct. 1940\nseems not to have told us what independent evidence he obtained,\nas he undoubtedly did, for the display in his flat of given drawings\nat given times. At present it seems to be open for a critic to suggest\nthat this vital factor rests on the testimony of Mr and Mrs Carington\nalone. And as Mr Carington has taken so much trouble to devise\na fraud-proof technique I hoj^e he will think it worth while to add\nthis one corroborative detail.\nYours, etc., Theodore Besterman.\nREVIEWS\nPoltergeists.

Specialised\nknowledge of physical phenomena, of what can be done by simula-\ntion, and of the points where the testimony of untrained observers is\nlikely to be fallible, is indeed indispensable, and an author who is\nnot himself a Psychical Researcher must in these matters put his\nfaith in the expert. It may happen that some of his selected experts\nare not worthy of the faith reposed in them. But in the investi-\ngation of Poltergeists a correct judgment of psychological factors\nis of the utmost importance, and this is a matter as to which a\nwriter with such wide human interests as Mr Sitwell shows is worthy\nof attentive hearing.\n\" The method of this book,\" writes the author, \" is as follows. We\nbegin with an Introduction dealing with many Poltergeist stories in\ngeneral. This is followed by the Examination of particular cases,\nafter which the Chosen Instances are printed. A Story, therefore,\nwhich is discussed in the Examination will appear, narrated at full\nlength from the original sources, among our Chosen Instances.\"\nThis method offers several advantages. The reader with little or no\nprevious knowledge of the subject does not find himself plunged\n\fSept.-Oct. 1940 Reviews 195\nsuddenly into a mass of detailed narrative, the significant points of\nwhicli he cannot at that stage distinguish ; while the danger of\nsuperficiality, inherent in any summarising of the original accounts,\nis also avoided. Praise should also be given to the appropriately\nfantastic drawings which enliven the book.\nThe Chosen Instances are divided into ten sections, two of them\nbeing the classic Drummer of Tedworth, and the \" Supernatural\nDisturbances \" at Epworth Rectory. For five out of the remaining\neight sections Mr Sitwell draws, with acknowledgments, on the\nrecords of the S.P.R. We may congratulate him on making so good\na choice of instances, and ourselves on having been able to provide\nso much of the raw material for this interesting book.\nBefore he has read many pages of the Introduction the reader will\nhave discovered that Mr Bitwell's delightful style is the appropriate\nvehicle of an imaginative insight into the problem as a whole, which\nis not at all incompatible with scholarly treatment of the records.\nThe significant features common to many reports of Poltergeists\nare clearly indicated ; the scene a backwater of civilisation, the\nmanifestations (often but not always) centring round a child or\nperson of low intelligence, the traditional linkage between one\nreported case and another, the resemblance of the phenomena to\nthose recorded in the trials of witches, not to mention the lives of\nthe Saints.\nIt is admitted that many of the minor phenomena are due to\ntrickery, but Mr Sitwell considers that some of the major incidents\ncannot be explained in that way. In this view he has the support\nof several Psychical Researchers of eminence, and there are un-\ndoubtedly some cases, mostly rather old cases, recorded by persons\nwho obviously were intent on telling the plain truth, and seemuig on\nthe face of them beyond explanation by normal means. The question\nis, would their apparent supernormality have successfully stood\nthe challenge, had the events occurred at a time when the general\nnature of Poltergeists was as well understood as it now is, and had\nthey been at once submitted to critical examination? It is notable\nthat ever since the days of the Lang-Podmore controversy (see\nProc. XII and XVII) the advocates of supernormality have largely\nrelied either on what must, in Psychical Research, be regarded as\npre-history, or on modern cases where either the accuracy or the\ncritical power of the recorders is open to suspicion. Modernity is\nnot everything : some modern records compare very unfavourai^ly\nfor candour and completeness with, e.g., those of the disturbances in\nthe Wesley household.\nAs to the purpose behmd these incidents Mr Sitwell cpiite correctly\n\f196 journal of Society for Psychical Uesearch Sept.-Oct. 1940\npoints out that they are not mere innocent childish pranks designed\nto amuse . The intention is to mystify, or even terrify, the household\nand neighbours, and where a subnormal person, child or adult, is the\nfocus of the disturbances, an ulterior purpose, to magnify that person\nand compensate him (or, more often, her) for the subnormality, can\nusually be inferred. It is an unpleasant business admittedly, but the\nevidence for invoking, as Mr Sitwell does, some mahgn external\nagency is not very strong.\nBorley Rectory, now gutted l)y fire, has been the scene of one of\nthe most interesting \" haimts \" of our time, well deserving thorough\ninvestigation and record. Mr Price had the good fortune to be called\nin at a critical stage, and later to have the building for a year\n(19 May, 1937, to 1938) under his exclusive control.\nThe peculiar features of the Borley case are that, prior to Mr\nPrice's tenancy in 1937, the Rectory, built in 1863, had been\nhaunted during its occupation by fom- incumbents, the last of whom\nleft in 1935, and that in 1929, shortly after the third incumbent had\nbeen inducted, the nature of the phenomena radically changed.\nDuring the first two incumbencies, that of the Rev. Henry Bull,\nwho built the Rectory, and his son \" Harry \" Bull, there had\nlieen no certainly objective phenomena.^ Apparitions were seen,\nnotably a \"Nun\" ; and footsteps, human and animal, and other\nnoises were heard. Of the \" Nun \" Mr Price writes \"It is quite\ncertain that this figure, seen first by four persons simultaneously,\nwas objective. It Avas solid, like a human being : not a subjective\nimage, a phantasm, or figment of the imagination.\" But neither\nthe appearance of solidity, nor collective perception can be\nregarded as tests of objectivity ; at any rate they were not so\nregarded by the authors oi Phantasms of the Living or the signatories\nof the Report on the Census of Hallucinations, who were entitled\nto speak with authority. The pattering of feet, etc. are typical of\nsu])jective illusions or hallucinations.\nIn course of time a romantic, but quite unhistoric, legend grew up,\nof a novice who had broken her vows, and after an unsuccessful\nelopement with a lay lirother in a coach and pair, had been immured\nin the convent walls. The \" coach \" was in due course seen by two\npercipients. It would have been of great interest, and of assistance\nin judging the \" objective \" phenomena which happened later, if the\n1 It is not clear from the text (p. 45) and Appendix F, when the ringing\nof bells mentioned on p. 45 occurred. Whatever the date, it was presuma})ly\nobjective, but without further evidence should not be assiuned to be wuper-\nnormal.\n\fSept.-Oct. 1940 Reviews 197\nreader liad been given a full statement, with, dates, showing the\ngrowth of the legend and the sequence of the phenomena relating to\nit. It is of the utmost importance in cases of recurrent phantasms,\nvisual or auditory, to trace with great precision the time and circum-\nstances of the first occurrence, and to show to what extent the later\npercipients were aware of the earher percipients' experiences. In the\nparticular case of Borley it may be inferred that the occurrences\nwere public property in the neighbourhood from the start, but who\nstarted it all, and what was his or her mental condition?\nMr Price states (p. 74) \" that not one of the Bull family ... is\nconcerned with psychical research or spiritualism, or knows any-\nthing of the subject \", but this is contradicted by the statement\non p. 25 that the Rev. Hemy Bull used to retire to a small\nsummerhouse in the early morning to \" commune with the\nspirits\". From this and other passages it is evident that the\natmosphere of the Bull household at Borley was strongly spiritual-\nistic from the beginning, and highly favourable to the occurrence\nof hallucinations due to suggestion. This should be borne in mind\nin considering the many incidents related on the testimony of the\nBulls, their servants and neighbours.\nThe third incumbent, the Rev. G. E. Smith, entered into occupa-\ntion in 1928, and soon after an enterprising journahst called in Mr\nPrice. It was at this stage that the haunt changed its nature :\nPoltergeist activities which, whether supernormal or not, A^'ere\ncertainly objective, became the leading feature. Mr Price had the\ngood fortune to be present when the first of these occurred. A\nmonth later Mr Smith left the Rectory, a large ill-arranged building,\nexpensive and inconvenient to maintain, but the phenomena still\ncontinued. In 1930 Mr Smith ceased to be Rector, the Rev. L. A.\nFoyster, a cousin of the Bulls, was appointed, and he and Mrs Foyster\ntook up residence. To Mrs Foyster, a young woman accustomed to\nlife in a holiday town on the South Coast, the change to the lonely\nbarracks of Borley Rectory must have seemed very dreary.\nPoltergeist phenomena continued unabated, and included sup-\nposedly supernormal writings addressed to Marianne \", Mrs\nFoyster's christian name. In October 1931 Mr Price was again\ncalled in, and brought with him a party including two members of\nthe S.P.R., Mrs Goldney and Miss May Walker. They experienced\nvarious incidents, all of which occurred when Mrs Foyster \" was\nnot within our sight or mider our control \", and the following\nmorning they informed her husband that she could have produced\nall the manifestations normally. Mrs Foyster \" stoutly denied that\nshe was in any A\\'ay responsiljlc, and wc accepted her word. The\n\f198 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Sept.-Oct. 1940\nEector pointed out that every occupant of the Rectory since the\nplace was built had been similarly accused\u2014which was correct \".\nIt is to be regretted that nowhere in the book does Mr Price\nthoroughly tackle the question of trickery. The phenomena\noccurring during the first two incumbencies were, as we have seen,\nsubjective, and call for no explanation beyond morbid imaguiation\nand suggestive hallucination. But many of the later phenomena\nwere of the kind that, alike in the seance-room and in Poltergeist\ncases, have often been simulated. That any single individual was\nresponsible for them all is improbable, but that does not dispose of\nthe question. Mr Price ends a chapter headed \" Can the phenomena\nbe explained? \" with the words \"that hypothesis [i.e. the spirit\nhypothesis] is immensely strengthened by these phenomena, if they\nare genuine \". Does Mr Price think they were genuine, or not?\nWhich, if any, does he consider genuine? After ten years' investi-\ngation he ought to be able to enlighten his readers.\nThe Foysters left in 1936 and the new Rector decided to live in\nthe other parish, with which Borley was now amalgamated. Borley\nRectory thus became vacant, and was rented by Mr Price for a year\n(May 1937 to May 1938). Seldom, if ever, can a Psychical Researcher\nhave had such a magnificent opportunity in his grasp, and never,\nsurely, was such an opportunity so pitifully wasted. What addition\nto our knowledge might not have resulted if the persons invited to\ninvestigate this house, with its long history of recurrent phenomena\nof many kinds, had been Psychical Researchers of standing, with\nexijerience in investigating both hallucinatory phantasms and the\nphysical phenomena of the Seance room, and not a random collec-\ntion of B.B.C. officials and others whose publicity value notably\nexceeded their usefulness as investigators of a difficult case? In\nthe long list (Appendix E) of \" Official Observers and others . . .\nwho witnessed phenomena or alleged phenomena and omitting\nMr Price himself, the only persons named who have any standing in\nPsychical Research are Mrs Goldney and Miss Walker, who visited\nthe Rectory in 1931 and not, it would appear, during the year when\nMr Price had exclusive control of it.\nAfter Mr Price's tenancy expired the house was bought by a lay-\nman, and occupied by him till its destruction by fire in February\n1939. On 27 March 1938 Miss Cllanville (a collateral descendant,\nit is said, of the author of Saducismiis Triuinphaias) received a plan-\nchette message, whicli Ijegan :\n\" Sunex Amures and one of his men\n[indistinct] MEAN TO BURN THE RECTORY to-night at 9\no'clock . .\n.\" The Rectory was in fact burnt at midnight eleven\nmonths later, through the owner carelessly upsetting an oil lamp.\n\fSept.-Oct. 1940 Reviews 199\nAt first this reads lilce a parody of Mr Dunne in liis less evidential\nmoods, but apparently Mr Price takes it, or intends the reader to take\nit, as a serious instance of prediction.\nParticular attention should be called to the footnote on p. 192.\n\" Since the above was written, there has been established (January\n1940) at Trinity College, Cambridge, a studentship in Psychical Re-\nsearch\u2014the first of its kind in any British University.

H. S.\nThe Meclmmship of Jack Webber. By Harry Edwards. Pp. 119.\nLondon : Rider & Co. (1940.) Price 12s. 6d.\nIt is not ea.sy to know how to review this book. It is in no sense\na scientific publication but consists of a collection of stories, incidents\nand anecdotes where the principal role is played by one John Boaclen\nWebber (\" Jack Webber \"), a public medium, who has recently died\nand in whose presence alleged physical phenomena have been\nreported.\nThe mediumship is of a type familiar to all psychical researchers.\nThere are \" ectoj^lasmic\n'\"\narms and voice boxes : apports ;\ntrum^^et\nmanifestations ;\nl)reakings of furniture, materializations : levita-\ntions ;\nand so on. Among the more striking phenomena was the\nremoval of the medium's jacket when his hands and arms were\nsecured by rope to the arms of his chair ; and more striking still\nthe removal of the same jacket when his hands were held, or rather\nwere said to be held, by members of the audience.\nSince there is not a single detailed or scientific description of any\nsitting in the book, criticism or appraisal of the material is not\npossible. The l^eliever in these manifestations will continue to\nbelieve and have his belief strengthened : the imbeliever will still\nremain unconvinced. Probably the best attitude for the critical\npsychical researcher to adopt is to remain critical and observant of\nthe little that can be observed. Even if the photographs repro-\nduced in this book show no supernormal phenomena they show at\nleast one thing, namely, the uselessness of using one length of rope\n\f200 Journal of Society for Psychical Research RErT.-OcT. 1940\nto tie up a medram. Plates 3, 4, 5, 6 and 12 all show clearly the\nprocess by which slack can be taken np and the hands freed.\nAlthough this has been pointed out to spiritualists for over half a\ncentury it still falls on deaf ears. One encouraging feature is, how-\never, to be noted. Ectoplasm is becoming stronger. In the case\nof Frau Silbert even the glance of the himian eye was detrimental.\nBut with Jack Webber the material could be handled, and on one\noccasion two sitters had to be asked to arrange its folds so that it\ncould be photographed. Indeed sometimes it had to be unravelled\nto \" open it out \", but none of these operations seems to have helped\nus in knowing anything about it. It is described as hke silk of rich\nquality, wet toy balloon rubber and thin seaweed. Evidently true\nto type it changes its appearance and texture just as it did with\nEva C. and Margery. The reader can put what interpretation he\nlikes upon this fact. The evidence for a decision does not exist.\nSo we are back almost where we started. The will o' the wisp has\njumped another hedge. E. J. D.\nThis Sjnritualisni. Results of an Inquiry. By Charles J. Seymour.\n(Longmans, Green & Co.) 1940.\nI confess that, when I first read the title of this little book of 143\npages, this \" this \" misled me. I supposed it implied a sceptical\nor perhaps sarcastic attitude on the author's part. I was mistaken :\n\" THIS SPIRITUALISM \" is a beUever's work.\nThis believer seems to see the chief value of Spiritualism in the\nfact that, according to him, it affords us the proof that the Universe\n\" makes sense \". \"A man \", so Mr Seymour supposes, \" desires to\nrender service and to be creative. He spends his life fashioning\nhimself into a tool for those ends.\" And then suddenly, \" the instru-\nment into which he has forged himself is\u2014according to the material-\nists\u2014destroyed.\" The author thinks such a case \" repugnant, an\noutrage on the intellect, because it is so wasteful, so blundering bad\nmanagement \"\n(p. 38). Well, Spiritualism reveals to us that the\n\" Creator continues to use us \"\n(p. 39) even after our death. I am\nnot convinced that Mr Seymour's reasoning is a sound one. The\nUniverse, he considers, \" must make sense \". But why, I wonder,\nshould this \" sense \" agree with our preconceived notions? There\nmay be in the Cosmos a \" sense \", a meaning altogether different\nfrom these notions and to us quite inaccessible. (Here I fancy I\nhear a cynic muttering : \"Or perhaps no meaning at all.\") Apart\nfrom this, do not events but too real, abound around us, which, from\nour standpoint, are perfectly non-sensical and for which no hypo-\n\fSept. -Oct. 1940 Reviews 201\nthesis of a post-mortem existence, activity, retribution and what not\nwill atone? How about, e.g., the complete destruction, by accident\nor otherwise, of a splendid work of art, on which decades of labour\nhad been wasted, or of some new ingenious scientific appliance, per-\nhaps pregnant with countless blessings for mankind, on which in-\nfinite labour and skill had been equally lavished? How about the\ndeath of an inventor of genius on the eve of the day when he was\nabout to reveal his secret to the world, a secret which is to die with\nhim? Are not such facts also non-sensical? And in what way does\nSpirituahsm, or indeed any other doctrine postulating survival,\nexplain away the seeming absurdity of such facts?\nEvery time, Mr Seymour also thinks, \" there had been really\nthorough investigation for a sufficient period, with a sufficient\nnumber of mediums, the [Spiritualistic] phenomena were almost\ninvariably accepted as facts \"\n(p. 22). Such an assertion is much\ntoo sweeping\u2014seeing that such investigations have repeatedly taken\nplace\u2014and yet to-day, nearly a century after the \"'\nHydesville\nknockings \", not a single physical phenomenon of Spiritualism en-\njoys scientific acceptance. Nor is the situation much different so\nfar as such phenomena as telepathy and clairvoyance are concerned.\nAgain and again, we seem to grasp something substantial, only to\nfind ourselves once more before one more disappointment, one more\nvanished phantasm.\nIn justice to our author, let us add that his own researches embrac-\ning several years and undertaken by him in the beginning in a rather\nsceptical state of mind seem to have brought about results much\nmore satisfactory\u2014to him. But may not this be due to the fact\nthat he has contented himself with criteria and tests to which to\nsome of us will und oubtedly appear inadequate ? He narrates some\nexperiments and some incidents at which he was present (chiefly at\nprivate and public sittings with professional clairvoyants and clair-\nvoyantes), and I admit that a few of these look impressive in his\naccoimt. On the other hand, there must be so many possibiUties of\nfraud and collusion at some of these sittings that one hesitates to\narrive at a positive conclusion. But what I wish especially to ]3ro-\ntest against is attaching any importance to the mention by the\nmediums of such Christian names as William, John, Mary, etc.,\nwithout any more precise definition\u2014very likely in the hope that\none at least of such names will be sure to \" fit \". By the way, has\nit not been repeatedly asserted of late that \" spirits \" may feel\nespecial difficulty in recollecting names? If so, how are we to\nreconcile such assertions with the strings of names presented by\nclairvoyant mediums at public seances? I am afraid \" difficulties\n\"\n\f202 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Sei-t.-Uct. 1940\nbegin here only when names are asked for as tests : surely a discon-\ncerting detail.\nA special chapter is devoted by the author to Prophecy and\nDeduction and the painful admission is made in it that the so-\ncalled \" spirit guides \" failed egregiously in predicting that there\nwould be no Avar following on the \" trouble '\"\nin September 1939>\nAnd yet such assertions had been made as confidently then as in\n1938; when we had IVIr Chamberlain's \" flights \" and then\u2014Munich.\nBeing obviously of an optimistic turn of mind, Mr Seymour does not\napparently reject the invigorating hypothesis that the \" erroneous\njudgments \" formed in 1939 \" on the other side \" may have been\nnot an error but a \" design, to weed the movement of its philan-\nderers and faint-hearts and to save it from its enthusiastic publicity\ngo-getters \"\n(p. 101). For my part I prefer to see in the spirit\nguides' discomfiture one more proof of the fact\u2014a fact established\nit seems to me by the whole history of humanity\u2014that whatever\nbe the case with man's alleged other supernormal faculties, he has\nNOT that of suj)ernormally foreseeing the future. Genuine premoni-\ntions in the strict sense of the word do not seem to me to exist at\nall. Supposing they did, nothing would be easier than to prove their\nreality beyond all possibility of cavil. This has never been done.^\nIt is curious to note that Mr Seymour is a believer in reincarna-\ntion (p. 93). I thought Anglo-Saxon believers in reincarnation\nrarae ares. Another curious feature is that Mr Seymour thinks\nreincarnation can be chosen\u2014surely an attractive jsrospect\u2014though\nI do not well see on what grounds he bases his belief.\nIt is characteristic that in a book dealing infer alia with various\naspects of the \" future life \" and \" written by a professed Christian \",\nthe word \" Hell \" does not appear once. This I think distinctly\nillogical on the part of such a Christian, but nevertheless significant,\nbecause showing the present discredit of the Gehenna doctrine.\nWere I to sum up the impression produced on me by Mr Seymour's\nlittle book, I would say that it has been written by a man who is\nsincere, by no means hy|iercritical. but not devoid of literary\naliility, and th;it some of the theoretical disquisitions it contains are\ninteresting. It contains also a certain number of concrete observa-\ntions.

Although our Members will hope that the contingency\non which the transfer is to be made will never be fulfilled, they will\nbe gratified to learn that the College has accepted the trust. The\nacceptance^ coming so soon after the institution of the Perrott\nStudentship at Trinity College, Cambridge, is welcome as further\nevidence of the recognition in academic circles of the value of the\nSociety's work.\nThe Council have decided that the first investigation to be\nconducted under the Trust should be into Precognition, a subject\nfrequently referred to in Human Personality. For this purpose\nthey have appointed a Committee under the Chairmanship of the\nPresident.\nSIR OLIVER LODGE'S BOOKS AND PAPERS\nSir Oliver Lodge's family have very generously presented to the\nSociety several valuable l)ooks relating to psychical research from\nhis library and also various papers on the same subject.\nOn learning the acceptance by New College, Oxford, of the\nBlennerhassett Trust, they presented his complete set of S.P.R.\nProceedings and Journal to the College Library, which is, we are\ninformed, the first College Library at Oxford to possess a set.\nThe Librarian of the College has now become a member, so that\nfuture issues will find a place on the Library shelves.\nPERROTT STUDENTSHIP IN PSYCHICAL RESEARCH\nMr W. Whately Carington has been appointed by Trinity\nCollege, Cambridge, to the Perrott Studentship in Psychical Re-\nsearch. Particulars of this foundation were given in the Part of\nProceedings published last March (Vol. XLIV, p. 23). Mr Whately\nCarington has already commenced his duties. The selectors and Mr\nCarington are alike to be congratulated.\nPARANORMAL COGNITION\nSome Comments on Mr Carington's and Mr Soal's Recent\nExperimental Results\nIt is seldom wise to leap from experimental facts to speculations,\nbefore the meaning of the facts has been fully established, and their\nvalidity confirmed by further experiment if this is possible. But\n\fNov.-Dec. 1940 Paranormal Cognition 205\nsome speculation is usually needed in trying to interpret the facts ;\nand some construction and hypothesis is advisable in order to see\nwhat kind of interpretation should be put to the test of further\nexperiment. The facts elicited by Mr Carington and Mr Soal, in\napplying the same method of investigation to the results of two\nquite different experiments in paranormal cognition\/ appear to have\na meaning which concerns the way we perceive events in relation to\ntime. It may be useful to explore this question briefly, and as simply\nas possible, with the idea of seeing what behaviour of the human\nmind we have to take into account, and to encourage by well-adapted\nconditions, if we are to consolidate and extend this experimental\nfield.\nThe facts with which we are concerned are that subjects in Mr\nCarington's and Mr Soal's experiments showed apparent ability to\nperceive drawings or patterns not within reach of their normal senses,\nand to perceive them not at the time when they were presented (if\none may speak of the \" presentation \" of an object when it is not\ndisplayed to the known senses), but at times before or after their\npresentation. With Mr Carington's subjects, a drawing \" dis-\nplayed \" in a locked and empty room on, say, a Wednesday, appears\nto have been paranormally perceived on the Tuesday or the Thurs-\nday. With two of Mr Soal's subjects the unseen card-pattern pre-\nsented at 2.45 appears to have been paranormally perceived at, say,\n2.44 or 2.46. In both cases the perception was registered at a time\nwhen another drawing or card was the expected object of para-\nnormal attention.\nThere are two wide differences between Mr Carington's experiments\nand Mr Soal's. and one notable difference between their results.\nThe interval of time between the presentations is of the order of\ntwenty-four hours in the first case and of a minute or less in the\nsecond. Also, Mr Carington's subjects were encouraged to try for\nimpressions, and to record them by drawing, in conditions of isola-\ntion and quiet. Mr Soal's technique required the presence and the\nactivities of an experimenter and a recorder. One subject of his,\ncriticising the technique in discussion after a Private Meeting of the\nSociety, reported that she had had a strong feeling of distraction\nthrough these activities, especially from the use of the rubber stamp ;\nand others, if less conscious of distraction, will presumably not have\nbeen immune from its effects.\nBoth these differencies in the conditions, the much longer time-\ninterval between attempts at perception and the absence of particu-\nlar distractions in Mr Carington's experiment as compared with Mr\n1 Proc. Vol. XLVI. p. 34 et seq. (Part 162, June 1940).\n\f206 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Nov.-Dec.1940\nSeal's, could kave contributed to the one main difference in the\nresults\u2014that the paranormal effect appears to occur with Mr\nCarington's subjects in general, but with only two of Mr Seal's sub-\njects. These two may be \" white blackbirds \", in Professor Broad's\nphrase, in respect of paranormal cognition ; or their perceptive-\ncognitive faculty may be less easily knocked off its focus around a\nparticular point in time than is the case with Mr Soal's other\nsubjects. The results cannot show whether these others had a para-\nnormal faculty which was completely unfocused and diffused in the\ngiven conditions, or whether they should be classed as black black-\nbirds.\nIt is worth while to consider what we mean by a \" focus in time \".\nThis is a metaphor from optics and from the eyesight, whose focus\nis a concentration at and around a point in space. But the eyesight,\nlike all the physical senses, has a necessary concentration at and\naround a moment in time\u2014the changing \" now \" at which our\nphysical organism reacts with its environment. We must say \" at\nand around \" a moment in time, because instantaneous reaction is\nnot thinkable, and experiments in physiology have shown that a\nstimulus must have a given duration to produce any sensory effect.\nMr Saltmarsh has studied this bit of time at and around the apparent\nmoment of sensory reaction, and discussed it under the name of\n\" the specious present \".^ He shows ground for supposing that sub-\nliminal perception has, so to say, a wider spread in time than con-\nscious perception, and that this makes sense with the fact that\nparanormal cognition seems to find its stimuli more \" around \" and\nless \" at \" the percipient's present moment than does ordinary sense-\nperception. He suggests that at the subliminal levels which are\nmore remote from consciousness this time-spread may become very\nwide, and that this conception may make sense of the evidence for\nan emergence into present consciousness of direct cognitions of past\nand future event. (We can avoid the bogy of a fixed future by re-\nmembering that \" cognition of an event \" is more completely de-\nscribed as the formation of an image which represents the idea of\nan event. It could equally be called the cognition of a probability.)\nIf we adopt Mr Saltmarsh's xiseful way of thinl-cing, Mr Carington's\nand Mr Soal's results suggest that something interferes with their\nsubjects' aim of getting a correct impression of the drawing or\npattern which is \" now \" presented for paranormal cognition, and\nmakes this impression less likely to emerge than the image of a past\nor future presentation. The effect might be due simply to distrac-\ntion. We have noticed that a difference of timing and technique\n\"Proc. Vol. XXXIX, pp. 170-172.\n\fNov.-Dec. 1940 Paranormal Cognition 207\nmakes for more distracting elements in Mr Soal's experiments than\nin Mr Carington's, and that this difference goes with a difference in\nthe number of subjects who seem to get positive results\u2014for what\nthis observation may be worth. Mr Seal's valuable discovery that\nwhen, in the chance distribution of cards, the same pattern is pre-\nsented both immediately before and immediately after a given\n\" now \", the subject making his guess at the \" now \" shows a\nreinforced tendency to hit the neighbouring mark,^ is also compatible\nwith the view that the \" now \" impression is confused by the com-\npetition of the more vivid sensory impressions occurring at the same\n\"now\".\nBut there are also sensory impressions of the same vividness to\nconfuse matters at the preceding and the subsequent \" now \". To\nexplain the effect in terms of distraction, we have to explain how it\nmay be that paracognitive impressions are confused by sensory\nimpressions from the same \" now \", while a paracognitive impression\npresumably arising from a \" then \" can emerge relatively undis-\nturbed by distractions arising in the \" now \" in which the emergence\noccurs. We can say that the \" then \" impression and the \" now\n\"\nsensory distractions, though coming into consciousness together, are\nmental reports of impacts which in fact occurred with an interval of\ntime to separate them, and that the mind is naturally better able to\ndiscriminate between successive than between simultaneous impacts.\nThis might cover the ground ; but there seems to be need for such\na further hypothesis as Mr Soal's, that a personified subliminal per-\ncipient \" knows \" whether an impression is correctly rendered at the\nconscious level,^ and has autonomous reactions of its own which have\nto be taken into account. There is, of course, plenty of evidence for\nsuch autonomous fractions of the personality.\nWe have observed that in Mr Carington's cases, which first dis-\nclosed the preferential emergence of \" then \" impressions in a\n\" now \" context, the time-sequence of presentations is much more\nleisurely\u2014the \" then \" much further separated from the \" now \"\n\u2014\nthan in Mr Soal's cases. Using Mr Saltmarsh's hypothesis, we can\nprobably infer that in the relative absence of sensory distractions,\nand having time to burn, Mr Carington's subjects were able to relax\ntheir time-focus to a much greater extent, so as to employ fairly\nconsistently a subhminal \" specious present \" reaching about\ntwenty-four hours in either direction.

The procedure, which\nis very fairly flexible, can be used with one or more percipients\n(though, naturally, the more the better), but for the best results two\nseparate experiments should be carried out with an interval of two\nor three weeks between them. Each experiment can be condensed\ninto about an hour's work if desired.\nThe requisite forms, etc., with full instructions, can be obtained\nfrom me at the address given below, and I very much hope that as\n'Not that they would be likely to show \"signs of tension\"\u2014-which are\noften signs of failure to maintain a fully co-ordinated effort.\n\fNov.-Dec. 1940 Correspondence 209\nmany members as possible will attempt the experiment.

I did not regard these experiments, and do not propose\nto regard others of the same kind in future, as tests or demonstra-\ntions of my wife's or my own veracity : moreover, to have sought\nindependent corroboration would have opened the door to just that\npossibility of leakage which I was most anxious to avoid.

In the absence of any positive antecedent evidence of charla-\ntanry, I fail to see why anyone performing experiments of this\ncharacter should ipso facto be more suspect of dishonesty than any\nother investigator, and to encourage the supposition that he is,\nseems to me inimical to the best interests of the subject.\n;\n'\nYours, etc.,\n\\ Whately Carington.\ni\n\" This Spiritualism\n\"\nSir,\u2014May I respectfully point out that Count Perovski-Petrovo-\nSolovovo's review seems to miss the point of Mr Seymour's argu-\nment?

Mr Seymour\nconsiders that apart from this assurance of survival there is no clue\nto the meaning of life as we experience it ; but he claims that, if\nsurvival is a fact, we can accept the poet Keats' conclusion that this\n\f210 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Nov.-Dec. 1940\nworld is a \" vale of soul making \", the otherwise inexplicable ex-\nperiences of this mortal hfe can be viewed as a training for further\ndevelopment of human souls after death ; and the principle of\nevolution which science has shown to be dominant in this world\nis seen to be a cosmic principle, governing not matter only, but\nmind and personality. Those who recognise this principle as an\nessential element in the age-long process of the whole Universe,\napplicable to every smallest part as completely as it is to the great\nwhole, will not let themselves be limited by illusive appearances\nwhich seem to truncate the process in human existence.

Dallas\nEEVIEWS\nWhy I do believe in Survival. By B. Abdy Collins, CLE. 28 pp.\nIs. net.\nTliis paper, read to a Private Meeting of the Society on 24 April\n1940, has been privately issued by the author, with a Preface criti-\ncising the attitude of the Society in rejecting the paper for publica-\ntion in its Proceedings and in remaining umesponsive when Mr\nColhns \" asked to be informed which cases were open to this criti-\ncism \" (as to evidential quality) \" in order that I might either omit\nthem or substitute others, which would be accepted \". It may be\nremarked that the Committee of Reference, to whose members any\npaper which is offered to Proceedings is circulated for their opinion\non its suitability for such publication, cannot so easily be expected\nto collaborate with authors in bringing their work up to its standards;\nand that the Hon. Secretary came up to London to discuss the\npaper with its author, and made some suggestions which were not\nin fact accepted. But we are concerned rather with the undoubted\ninterest of Mr Collins's treatment of the evidence for survival,\nregarded more as a subject for discussion than as a ground of\nformulated statement. Some comment, at all events, may be not\ninappropriate from the one officer of the Society who was free to\nattend the Private Meeting at which Mr Collins eventually read his\npaper (his preface records his impression that no officer of the\nSociety was present), and, as it happens, an ofhcer who has known\nthe experience of presenting work to the Society which was dis-\ncriminatingly adjudged to be suitable for discussion at a Private\n\fN6v.-Dec. 1940 Reviews 211\nMeeting rather than for record in Proceedings as a judgment on\nevidence.\nProfessor E. E,. Dodds, in his paper Why 1 do not Believe in Sur-\nvival, 1 had given his reasons not so much for rejecting a prevalent\nhuman beUef as for preferring a presumably more economical hy-\npothesis of telepathy between the living to that of telepathy from\nthe dead\u2014the presumption to be justified being that it is the more\neconomical hypothesis to regard evidence for survival as bringing\ninto play a particularly complex and specially developed form of\ntelepathy between the living. These hypotheses, he has more\nrecently suggested, constitute a \" staggering dilemma \" presented\nby the evidence.^ Mr Collins claims in effect, but really argues the\npoint only in a brief passage near the end of his Appendix, that the\nhypothesis of survival and communication involves tlie lesser\nmiracle.\nMr Collins is concerned with evidence of identity. \" In sittings\nwith mediums, I don't want to prove whether the communicator\nsurvives. I know he survives. I only want him to prove his\nidentity.\" Professor Dodds made a point of the lack of such evi-\ndence, in two and a half millennia of man's recorded history. It\ncould be answered that man had little care for experimental evi-\ndence, as we understand it, before the time of Galileo, and none for\nformal evidence of survival until the beginnings of psychical research\nin the latter part of the last century. Mr Collins cites a number of\nincidents reported in bygone days which are evidence of belief in\nsurvival and in the identity of apparitions, but that is another\nmatter ; he was unwary in accepting Professor Dodds's groimd of\nobjection. And it appears throughout the paper that Professor\nDodds's grounds of argument, where they would most repay dis-\ncussion and question, are left unregarded, while more and more\nevidence is thrown into the survivalist scale of a type which the\ncritic finds little difficulty in demolishing piecemeal. The critic may,\nof course, share Mr Collins's convictions while feeling that he does\nnot treat evidence scientifically : especially, that he treats it as\nnecessarily pointing to the conclusions which he has assumed.\nApart from cases of communication Mr Collins argues, as is\nreasonable, from the evidence for paranormal faculties in man to the\nconclusion that these are not attributes of a creature limited to in-\ncarnate existence ; but he adds to the presumable properties of man\nthe \" etheric body \" and its aptitude for travelling in space. This\nmay be a respectable hypothesis, though probably a crude hypo-\nthesis, to simplify the problem of apparent action at a distance be-\niProc. Vol. XLII., p. 147. ^Proc. Vol. XLV., p. 295.\n\f212 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Nov-Dec. 1940\ntween agent and percipient, but it is a physical hypothesis for which\nno physical evidence is established, and its adoption as a fact only\nburdens the desired proof of survival with more material for critical\ndisbelief. It is not merely \" the fashion among those engaged in\npsychical research to ignore \" phenomena suggesting a travelling\netheric body : the evidence in various fields, including medicine and\npsychology, shows that the mind fairly readily forms non-factual\nimages and impressions of bodily location. These are easy to induce\nunder hypnosis.\nMr Collins is perhaps on his strongest ground when he sub-\nordinates mediumistic and experimental evidence of survival to the\nfact of very wide and varied human experience suggesting the occa-\nsionally-perceived presence and influence of the departed : death-\nbed visions (by whose implications Professor Richet was much im-\npressed), the visions of children, and other spontaneous phenomena\nof which the human circumstances favour their credibility. This is,\nin a sense, arguing from belief to belief, and trying to short-circuit\nthe process of rigorous examination, experiment and reasoning\nwhich is demanded by the nature of research. But if these spon-\ntaneous experiences of mankind do spring from a soil of pre-estab-\nlished belief, the belief itself is a fact of the situation which needs to\nbe examined, and estimated in respect of its quality. It was from\nsuch a ground that psychical research took its inception. The work\nof F. W. H. Myers was alive with the qualitative estimation of human\nexperience. It is no inept criticism to suggest that the Society may\nlose sight of this important scale of values by concentrating too\nexclusively upon work resembling that of the dissecting-room or the\nphysical laboratory. None the less, its research was established to\nbring scientific method increasingly into the examination of belief.\nResearch cannot suffer from too much science, or from too rigorous\n(if not too rigid) an apphcation of known scientific principles ;\nthough in subjects which involve the processes of human life and\nmind it may suffer from inappropriate exclusion of human values.\nProfessor Dodds has not failed to argue from such values, where he\nhas found their application valid in a negative sense.\nIf recourse to what may be termed the dignity of the evidence, as\nit is apparent in such records as those of death-bed scenes, is of\nadvantage to reasoned belief in survival, we have to admit a counter-\nacting effect in the unimpressive nature of a great body of medium-\nistic phenomena. We can say that these are less natural products\nand that the channel of mediumship is often open to the flow of futile,\nmuddled and misleading material. This may be in part the ground\nfor Mr CoUins's relegation of mediumship to a secondary place. But\n\fNov.-Dec. 1940 Reviews 213\nit is the more curious that he accepts that very strange product of\nmediumship, materiahsation, as convincing evidence of survival.\nWhether we agree with Richet that seance-room materiahsation is\n\" absurd \", but true, or consider that the frequent evidence of\nfraud connected with it makes the apparently genuine cases at least\nsubject to suspicion, the question before us seems to be the occur-\nrence or non-occurrence of a queer psycho-physical fact. Whether\nor not we beheve in ectoplasm, on the evidence, j\\'Ir Collins describes\nno evidence for the identity of forms produced by it, and such\nevidence does not appear to have been put on record as the result\nof any reliable investigation.\nThis question of identity, indeed, is one which Mr Collins osten-\nsibly takes into account and actually leaves untouched by any form\nof consecutive argument. The whole question of who or what an\napparition, an \" influence or a communicator may be, hinges first\nupon evidence of identity, if evidence of survival is under discussion.\nIt is a fact that evidence of identity is more difi&cult to establish\npositively than we usually suppose : it is a more intangible thing,\neven in everyday life, than is commonly realised. But aU the more\nfor that, it needs constructive and consistent handling. It is, per-\nhaps, the lack of this backbone to his case which makes Mr CoUins's\ndiscussion seem little more than a series of argued assertions, distin-\nguished by consistency of aim rather than cogency of reasoning.\nK.

Tests of Extra-\nSensory Perception Among A.S.P.R. Members. By Dr\nGardner Murphy and Ernest Taves.\nThe Proceedings of the American Society have not been issued\nsince 1933, and it is a pleasure to see them reappear with so clear-\ncut and straightforward an account of experimental work as that\ngiven by Dr Murphy and Mr Taves.\nThe experiments were all of the card-guessing type, though several\ndiiferent kinds of card were used. The percipients were interested\nmembers of the American S.P.R., working in small groups of from\nfive to eight or nine at a time. The experimental conditions appear\nto have been unexceptionable ; in particular, the test material was\nalways taken to the scene of action in an opaque box and was never\nopened until after it had been guessed ; if ever reshuffling was\nnecessary, as for a further series of guesses, it was done in a separate\n\f214 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Nov.-Dec. 1940\nroom. Careful precautions were taken to eliminate errors of scoring,\nshuffling and checking.\nMuch of the work was done on guesses of the 50-50 type, in which\nthe pack contains equal numbers of cards of two sorts only. This\ngave very curious results. For example, 6975 guesses at Red or\nWhite cards gave a deficiency of 122-5 successes, which is highly\nsignificant -both intrinsically (P=-0003) and considered as the best\nof twelve tasks attempted. But it is interesting to note that of the\nfive other tasks involving colour discrimination (Red-Black, Yellow-\nBlue, Black-White, Red-Yellow) four give a negative result, while\nof the four similar 50-50 tasks involving other qualities (Circle-\nBlank, Square-Waves, Circle-Cross, Portraits of Men-Portraits of\nWomen) three give positive results. There is a suggestion here,\nthough no more, that it is the colour rather than the redness or\nwhiteness that is responsible for the negative result. Of the 24\npercipients who took part, no fewer than 17 scored below expecta-\ntion, 6 above, and 1 the exact number expected. This is just\nsignificant, with P a trifle less than -05 ; so it looks as if the \" nega-\ntavity \" with respect to the Red-White situation were fairly wide-\nspread.\nThe other task which yielded significant results (positive in this\ncase) was with what are known as Rook cards. A pack of these\nconsists of 4 suits of 14 cards each, numbered 1 to 14 in different\ncolours, and the task was to guess the finest 14 and last 14 of the pack.\nThere was a slight, though not quite significant, tendency for the\npercipients generally to score above expectation ;\nbut one achieved\nan excess of 37 successes in 90 runs of 14 calls each, giving P less\nthan -0001. The only other task reported, in which five cards\nmarked with a dot were shuffled into 45 blanks, gave null results.\nSimple experiments of this kind lend themselves well to group\nworking, such as Societies can conveniently undertake, and there is\na strong suggestion that frequent variation of the task, such as\nwould reheve the monotony for the participants, promotes the\nobtaining of worth-while results\u2014compare also Pratt & Woodruff,\nJournal of Parapsychology, Vol. 3, No. 2. It is greatly to be hoped\nthat, under more favourable conditions than those now prevailing,\nwork of this kind may be undertaken by members of our own\nSociety ;\nparticularly that of repeating the colour discrimination\ntests mentioned above.\nMy only quarrel with an otherwise admirable paper is that the\nvalues of \"P in Appendix I appear to have been quite gratuitously\nhalved We cannot have too much of this kind and quality of work.\nw. w. c.\n\fNov.-Dec. 1940 Reviews 215\nThe Physics of the Divining Rod. By J. Cecil Maby and T. Bedford\nFranklin. London : G. Bell & Sons, Ltd. (1939.) 21s.\nThe title, \" contents list of 51 illustrations, and clear print and\nparagraphing of this imposing volume of 452 pages, might be ex-\npected to bring some feeling of confidence to the intending reader\nthat he will find, in its text, good solid material for his consideration\nand subsequent digestion. This feeling might be expected to increase\nas the curious reader turns the pages, and notes the abundance of\ntechnical terms and confident statements of astonishing discoveries\nmade, apparently, with rather simple instrumental means. He will\nnote a large number of \" graphs \", a few of which show scales of\nnumbers at the bottom and at the left-hand edge. The scales at the\nbottom are tiyne scales, in days, hours, etc., but the other scale, the\nordinate of the graph, apparently does not refer to the dial or scale\nreading of any physical instrument, such as a galvanometer, electro-\nmeter, wavemeter, etc., taken at the time indicated on the time.scale,\nand acted upon solely by the physical enyironment. In the reviewer's\nopinion this is an example of the kind of vagueness which characterises\nthe description of what the authors claim to be physical experiments.\nThis vagueness concerning exact descriptions of the instruments\nused, their sensitivity, consistency in repeated experiments, etc., is,\nunfortunately, maintained through the whole book. It will most\ncertainly cause doubts to arise in the mind of the average physicist\nwho reads beyond p. 6 of the introduction, where it is stated :\n. . .\n\" we think we may claim incontrovertibly to have shown that\nthe causes of the ordinary dowsing reflexes and rod reactions are to\nbe found in certain penetrating, electrically excitor, rays : one class\n\u2014\nthe more important of the two\u2014consisting of short Hertzian waves of\ngeophysical or cosmic origin, and exhibiting polarisation and electro-\nmagnetic phenomena.\" Such laxity on the part of the authors might\nindeed be excused in the interest of providing light and easy instruc-\ntion concerning well-established knowledge (were this true) for those\nwho are scientifically untrained, and it could also be excused if a\nreference were given to details of the authors' investigations published\nin any scientific journal of repute. As matters stand it appears that\nthe novelty of their claims in the field of physics is as astonishing as\ntheir disregard for all other possible explanations of the variations\nof the readings of their instruments, upon which these claims are sup-\nposedly based. On p. 174 it is stated :\n\" it is evident that the dowser\nmust respond to the high frequency effects, due to Hertzian radia-\ntion ... his muscles acting both as receiving aerial and detector\nniechanism \".
