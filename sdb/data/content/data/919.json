CascheTidebearech, and\nwill be further cleared by this Preface) though by the carriage\nof it, in fomc relpeds, and by the Nature of it too, it might\nbe deemed and termed, \/^ Work of Varknejfe : Yrf it is no o-\nther then what with great tendcrneife and circumfpedlion,\nwas tendered to men of highelT: Dignity in Europe , Kings and Princes , and\nby all ( Ewg\/W excepted) liftned unto for a while with good refped:. By fome\ngladly embraced and entertained for along time ; the Fame whereof being car-\nryed unto ^o;\u00ab^,it made the Pope to beftir himlelf, not knowing what the event\nof it might be, and how much it might concern him. And indeed, filled all\nmen, Learned and Unlearned in moft places with great wonder and aftonifh-\nmcnt : all which things will be (hewed and made good (to the utmoft of\nwhat we have laid) in the Contents of this^book, by unqueftionable Records\nand evidences. And therefore I make no queftion but there will be men e-\nnough found in the world whole curiofity will lead them to Read what I think\nit not to beparahell'din that I\\tnd by any book that hath heenjet out in any Age to read : I\nfay, though it be to no other end then to fatisfie their cUrio\/ity. But whatfbever\nother men, according to their leveral inclinations, may propole to themfelvcs\nin the reading of it\n,\nyet I may and muft here profcfle in the nrft place, in Truth\nand Sincerity, that the end that I propofe to my felf ( fo far as I have contri-\nbuted to the Pubhftiing of the Work) is not tolatisfiecuriofity,but to do good,\nand promote Religion. When we were firft acquainted with the Book, and\nwere offered the reading of it, having but lately been converlant iri aSubjedtof\nmuch Affinity ; to w?t, o^ MJiaken Injpiration 3.nd Tojfe\/sion ^ through ignorance\nofNatural caules (which labour of ours, as it was ouraime at the firft in pub-\nlifhing of it, to do good, fo we have had good reafon fince to believe, that We\ndid not altogether miffeof whai weaimedat)we could not but gladly accept of it.\nAnd as we gladly accepted , fo we read unto the end with equal eagernefle and\nAlacrity : Which when we had done, truly it was our Opiniort , That the\nPublifhing of it could not but be very Seafonable and Ufeful, asagainft Jihei\/ls\nat all times, fo in thele Times efpecially, when the Spirit of Error and Illufi-\non, not in moMAnabajftiJis only, even ofthe worft kind that former Ages have\nknown ancf abhorred, doth fo much prevail, but in many alfb , who though\nthey difclaim and deteft openlv (and heartily too, I hope, moft of them) the\nfruiiis andelfed:s that fuch caules have produced in others, yet ground them-\nselves nevertheleile upon the lame principles of Suppofed Infpiration and irnma-\nginary %eViliitions ,\u2022 and upon that account deem themfelves, if not the Only, yet\nmuch better Chriftians then others. And I was much Confirmed in this Judg-'\ninent when I was told (as indeed 1 was, at the firft, by them that knew very\nWeil) that the ^o^ Reverend, Pious and Learned JirchbiJ]?op of ^rmagh^ lately\n. _ \u201e\nA ' ^ \"\ndeceaf-\n\fThe T'B.eF AQS.\ndeceafed, upon reading of the faid book, before his death, had declared him-\nfelf to the fame purpole, and wijhed it 'fnuted. But becaufe it is very poffible,\nthat every Reader will not at the firft be lb well able of himfelf to make that\ngoodufe by good and Rational Inferences and Obfervations of this fad Story\nas is aimed at, my chiefeft aim in this Preface is to help fuch. And becaufe it is\nnot lefle probable that this Licentious Age will afford very many, who with the\nSaduces oi old ( that is, Jewifh Epicures} believe no 5\/?\/m, or Angel, orRefur-\nredion ,\u2022 who therefore being prepolTefled with prejudice when they hear offo'\nmany Spirits as are here mentioned, and fo many ftrange Apparitions, infeveral\nKinds, will not only fling back themfelves, but will be ready to laugh at any\nother that give any credit to inch things. Although I will not take upon me to\nconvert anybyReafon that are engaged into fuch an opinion by a wicked lifej\nthat is, Unjuit pradifes. Luxurious lewd courfes,open profanenefife, under the\nname of Wit and Galantry, and the like , becaufe, I think, it is veryjuftwitH\nGod to leave fuch to the error and blindnelTc of their Judgments ,- lb that with,-,\nout a Miracle there can be little hopes of fuch. Yet I fhall hope that fuch as aj-^\nRational men, fober in their Lives and Converfations , fuch as I have known\nmy felf; yea, 'men of excellent parts in other things, men that are both willing\nto hear and able to confider : that fuch, I fay, may receive fome latisfadion by.\nwhat I (hall fay and propofeto their Ingenuous confideration in this matter. Were\nwe to araue the cafe by Scripture, the bufineffe would foonbe at an end ;\nthere\nbeing no one Controverted point, among men, that I know of, that can receive\na more Ample, Full, Clear and fpeedy determination, then this bulinefs of Spi-\nrifi, and Wtuhes^ and Apparitions may, if the Word of God might be judge. But\nI will iuppofe that 1 have to do with fuch, who though they do not altogether\ndeny the Word of God, yet will not eafily , however, admit >of any thing that\nthey 'think contrary to Reafon , or at leaft not to be maintained by Realbn. I\nfhall therefore forbear all Scripture Proofs and feftimonies in this particular,\nand delire the Chriftian Reader ( who otherwife might juftly take offence) to\ntake notice upon what ground it is that I forbear.\nBut. though I will not ufe any Scripture for proof, yet by way of Application\nI hope I may be allowed to ufe fome Scripture words, which may duedus\nperchance to a good Method in the examination of this bullneffe. The Apoltle\nfaith in a place, <p\u00ab.Vxo^7s\/ 1*^*\/ (ro^oJ, e;u\u00bbs\u00abe>icrct:. : (profe\/sin^them\/ihes to he wife ^ they became\nfools) I fliall not enquire of whom, and upon what occafion it was fpoken : I\ndraw no argument from it ; only becaule there is a fhew of great Wiiclom in\nthis Opinion J\nand yet, ^s I conceive, as much of Error and falfhood (that is,\nFolly J\nas the word is often ufed) as in any other falfe opinion that is lelfe popular.\nI will frame my difcourfetothis iffue, firft, to enquire what it is that makes\nit fo popular and pluifiblc, among them efpccially that pretend to more then\nordinary Wifdom^ and then fecondly, lay it open(as I amable)co the view in its\nright colours, that the Folly or falfhood of it may be difcernabie even to ordi-\nnary judgments.\nFiji then, (as for them that deny Spirits ^\nSec.) we lay. The world is full ofim-\npofturc; to know this, to obferve it in all Trades, inall ProfelTions, in all ranks\nand degrees of men, is to know the world, and that is to be wife. Though we\ncall zhem Jailers J\nyet they deierveto be thought the plainelldeaUng men of the\nworld that fliew their tricks openly in the ftreets for money ;\nfor they profefle\nwhat they are. They are the trueil; Juglers that do their feats (and they for mo-\n\fThe T%EFACE.\nny toojttioft of them) under the Veil and Reputation of HolincfTc^Sandity, (or\nSaintfhip) Religion, Virtue, Juftice, Friendfhip ;\nfine words to catch men that\nare ofealie Belief, and thinks that everything that glillers muft needs be gold.\nHence it is, that men that have had the Regutation of Wife men in the world\nhave commended this unto us as greateft Wildom, Not Easily To Be-\nL I E V \u00a3: Mw?*' ^ iiit^vY,sa [e.Tiriiv : \u00abfT?* 7<tt?T* ^Sy (pftfSy Epicharmus got more credit for\nthis one faying ( and hath done more good too, perchance) then many that\nhave been the Authors of vaft Volumes. Now if thofe things that are expofed\nto fenfc, the proper Objedis of our Eyes andEares, be lyable to {omuchlm-\npofture and Deceit, that the wifeft can fcarce know what to believe: How\nmuch more caution do we need in thofe things that are fo much above Senfe\nand in fome refpcds contrary to Senfe (and that is \u00abS\/)\/>\/ff) that we be not deceiv-\ned ? If we confidertheNaturc of man, his Bodily frame, the AfFedionsofhis\nfoul, the Faculties of his mind, we (hall have no occafion at all to wonder if\nmoft men are apt to believe and to be cheated- But as no caufe to wonder, fo as\nlittle cauie to imitate : Felix qui rerum potuit cognofcere caufas ! ri^<t]o^oyU, a deftre of-\nor to grange things that may caufe amaztmentj is the proper affection of-the vulgar,that\nis, of moll men , which they bring into the world with them, ( it is theob-\n(ervationof the wileftof menthat have Written concerning the affairs and a<51:i-\nonsof men) and cannot be rid of but by wifdom, which is the happinefle of\nfew : Etrandi^ non necefsitas tantum^ fed amor. Seneca fbmewhere fpeakingof the\nNature of Man j There was a time when the world was much governed by 0-\nracles\n;\nprivate men went unto them as unto God, Kings and Princes lent unto\nthem to be advifed about greateft matters : and fo much faith was afcribcd unto\nthem, generally , that the very word became a Proverb appliable unto thofe\nthings, whereof no queftion can be made. Yet thofe very ancient Heathens\n,\nthat tell us of thefc Oracles, tell us of their vanity; and though they fay nor.\nThat all were falfe and counterfeit, yet whileft they acknowledgit of lbme,they\ngive us juft occafion to fufpecft that it might have been found iis true of the reft\nalfb, had like care been taken to examine the truth of them alfo.\nAgain, there was a time (and that time not many hundred years yet paft)\nwhen Miracles were the only difcourfe and delight of men: Ghoftsand Spi-\nrits were in every houle ; and fb prone were men to receive what was delive-\nred unto them in that kind, that Miracle-makers were much put to it , not\nto make their ftories probable, (for that was not ftood upon ) but to make\nthem wonderful enough; infomuch that fome have been forced seetheiifeof.i<-\nto complain publickly of the credulity of the people, who yet them- *\"\"\"\" '^^\u2022\nfelves tell us much more, I dare fay, then was ever true. As of Miracles, fo\nof Exorcifmes : How many Divels and Spirits have been driven out of men and\nwomen, fuppofed to be p^pJJ^d^ by Iblemn Exorcifmes, to the great wonder\nof the beholders, which afterwards upon further fearch and examination, have\nbeen convicted to have been nothing; but the artifices and fubtil contrivances of\nmen ? Sentences and Judgments have palled upon fuch cheats when they have\nbeen difcovered in moft places of Europe, which have been publiOied. But\nthey have done ftrange things though ( fome that were though: poffefTed) and\nthings impoftible, to ordinary fenfe, to be done by Nature, It is very true,lome\nhave : But they that know what ftrange things may be done to the amaze-\nA 1 rricnt\n\fIhe T \"RE FACE.\nment of all not acquainted with fuch myfteries, by long lifi and Cupme^ they\nwill not eafily wonder (fo as to make a fupernatural thing of it) though they\nfee things, which , to their fight and of moft, cannot but feem very wonder-\nful and almoft impoiTible. As for the bodily temper of man and of his ^rain^\nit hath been fufficicntly by fome late books of that fubjea: ( Enthufia\/me )\nboth by reafons from Nature, and by fund ry examples proved, that a very lit-\ntle diftemper ol the brain,fcarce difcernable unto any,but thofe that are well verfcd\nin theftudyof Natural caufes , is enough toreprefent Spirits, Angels and Di-\nvels, Sights and Stories of Heaven and Hell to the Fancy : by which fober kind\nof MadnelTe anddeliration, fo little underftood vulgarly, many have been, and\nare daily deceived j and from thefe things , through the ignorance of men ,\nftrant^e things fometimeshaveenfued, and the peace of Common-wcales hath\nfuffered not a little.\nJnjlotk^ in his Meteors, tells of one thatalwayes faw (fo he thought,at leaft)\nanother man's fhape before his eyes, and how they happened unto him naturally,\nhe gives a reafon. Hyppocrates^ mpi araf9\u00abr\u00ab<v^, ( a v^'-y fliuit Difcourlc, but full\nof excellent matter) fheweth how fome, both men and women, through Na-\ntural caufes, come to fancy to them felves that they fee j^^v^-f Divels and Spirits,\nand to be tormented in their Souls, even to the making away of themfelves by\ntheir own hands. The Author of the book, Ve Morbo Sacro, (very ancient too,\nbur notricrht HyppocrateSj as many are of opinion) hath excellent matter too,to\nthe fame purpoie ; but I have not the book a- this time by me. Hyppocrates\n^\n(where before) fheweth how many in that cafe were gulled by the Priefts of\nthofe times, making them believe , That this happened to them through the\nanther of fome god. \" They that are verftinthe 0\/^\u00abc\/iiknow,Thatthereis a\n\"way, through the help of ^lajfes th^Lt fhall not be feen, to make moving fha-\n*\n'dows that Ihall appear like Ghofts, to the great terror of the ignorant behold-\n\" er : and it is faid, That pretended Aftrologers and Fortune-tellers cheat many\n\" by thofe fights. It is the opinion of fome Jewifh Rabbins , That what\nGhofls or Souls are raifcd by ISjtcromancy^ they alwayes appear inverfocorp&re^ that\nis their head dowards and feet upwards. Though nothing is to be wondered\nat in Raboins, who (commonly) ate as full of ridiculous conceits as ever came\ninto the head of any Bedlam: Yet my opinion is, \" That the firfl ground of\n\" this wild conceit was, fome appearance by the Species of an objed:, gathered\n\"through a little ^\/dj\/e into a dark room. For fo indeed the objeds muftap-\n\" pear mVerfo corpore if it be done in a high room, and the objeds from whence\n\"the Spiecies are gathered be lower then the glafle through which theypafTe. And\nthe reafon of it is very Demonftrable to the fight of any reafonable man. Cer-\ntainly ,by this fecret(which yet is no great (ecret,being commonly leen and pradif-\ned among them that are any thing curious ) ftrange things may be done by a\nCunning-man, to their great amazement that know not the caule. There\nwould be no end if 1 fhould attempt to gather from feveral Authors what hath\nbeen invented by men, and what may be done by Art to cheat men in matters\nof thisnature. Letany man, thatisyetaftrangertoit, but read the Hfe of^Vx-\nander the falje frophet^ or Prognofticator , written by L\u00abad\/7, and he Oiall lee no-\ntable examples of fuccefl'eful Cheats and Impoflures, fcarce credible indeed, buc\nthat the thing was yet then frelli and famous , and that all circumibni.es of\n^ -\nHifto-*\n\fThe T%EFJCE.\nHiftory confirm the truth of the relation. And let him that reads it jnda^r\nwhat dull and dry fellows the Mountebank-Aftrologers, Proanoftjcators and\nFortune-tellers, of thefe dayes are,..to this Noble, Renowned Alexmviou Orily\nlet him know that reads ,\nthat Lnckn vjis a profeft Atheift, and therefore np\nwonder if he find Epicurus fpokerl of with great refpedt, whom all Atheiil:s,and\nAtheiftically inclined are fo much obliged to honour. -Thi^-vvcj^ted, I th'ink\nthe Story is very worthy to be known, and much more worthy to be read hyal\\\nmen (confideringthe good ufe that may be made of it) then many books that are\ndaily tranflated out of other languages,\nButlaftly, If there were any fuch thing, really as Divelsand Spirits that u(e to\nappear unto men ; to whom lliould they (probably) fooner appear, then to fuch\nas daily call upon them, and devote their Souls and Bodies untothern by dread-\nful Oaths and Imprecations ?

Truly, many books of old have been written to that effed:.

But this will not be granted by fome I am fure that are or\nhave been thought great oppugners of the common opinion about Witches and\nSpirits \u2022\nfome Phylicians I mean, and Naturalifts by their profelTion. But may\nnot weargue as plaufibly againft that which they profefle, as they have doneor\ncan do againft Spirits and Apparitions ? We would be loath to make fo long a\ndigrelTion \u2022 we have had occafion elfewhere to fay fomewhat to this purpofe:\nand they that will be fo curious may fee what hath been written by Cornel. Jgrip-\npa (who is very large upon this fiibjed:) about it, not to nstme any oth-rs. It is\nnot yet a full twelvc-moneth , that a friend of mine, a Gentleman of quality,\nbrought his Lady to London (fome 60 miles and upwards from his ordinary\ndwelling) to have the advice of Phyficians about his wife ( a very Virtuous and\nReligious Lady) troubled with a weak ftomack and ill digcftion , which cau^\ned gi ievous fymptoms. I think he had the advice of no lefle then a dozen firft\nandlaft : I am fiire he named unto me five or fix of thechiefefi: in Credit and\npractice that the Town aflFordeth. Not one of them did agree in their opinions,\ncither concerning the Caufe , or the means to be ufed for a Cure. So that the\nGentleman went away more unfatisfied then he came. What he did I know\nnot: I know what fome men would have inferred upon this. Yet I, for my\npart, for the benefit that I have received by it, and the effcwts that I have fcen of\n\fThe T\\SFACE.\nit, both iiponmyielf, and others in my life-time, upon ieveral occafions\n( whcxe learned JrttJJs J not Empiricl;^ have been employed) thou^^h all the\nworld (hould be ot another opinion, I think my felf bound to honour as\nithe profeilioa, lo all Learned, Ingenious Profeflbrs of it: and I make no\n<3ueftion but the vvorfl o( J^rippas objedions, by any man of competent\njudgment and experience, may^afily beanfwered.

The\ntruth is, flato's writings are full of Prodigies, Apparitions of Souls, pains\nof Hell and Purgatory , Revelations of the gods, and the like. Wherein\nhe is fo bold that he is fain to excuie himfelf fbmetimes, and doth not\ndciire that any man fhould believe him, according to the letter of his rela-\ntions, but in groffeonly, that iomewhat was true to that effedt.

How much healcribed to common re-\nport and experience, though no reafon could be given, doth appear by his\nPreface to hisTreatife Dc Divinatione pi^r wfomia: where he propofeth the\ncafe, how hard it is for a r.itional man to believe any thing upon seporc\nwhichhecan fee no realon for j\nnay ^ which ieemcth contrary to realon i\na-^jfor amanto foretel by dream what fhall happen in another KingJomC\nfar ott without any apparent caufe.

Lee\nthefe things be confidered, and let the Reader judge of how different tem-\nper Aiijloik was from that ot\" ancient or later Epicures. \"This mention of\nJrijlotle and Tlato puts me in mind of Socrates their Mailer, Ins Familiar\nSpirit-^ no Shape'but a Voice only, by which his life and adtions were\nmuch directed. The thirg is attelied by fo many, fo grave Authors where-\nof lome lived at the very time, others not long after, or in times notverjr\nremcte, that I know not how ic can be queifioned by any man. Neither\nindeed is it, that I remember, by any Heathens or Chriftians of ancient\ntimes, and there have been books written of it, divers^in Greek and Latine,\nwhereot fome are yet extant. But whether it were a good Spirit orarK\nevil, lome men have doubted, and ic is free for any man to think what\nhe pleafeth of it. For my part I ever had a Reverend opinion oi^ Socrates\n,\nand\n\fThe T\\SF ACE.\nand do believe (if there be no impiety in it, as I hope not) that he was as\namong Heathens in fome refped, a fore-runner of Chrift, to difpofethem\nthe better when the time fhouldcome to imbrace (and it did it efFedually)\nthe Gofpel. Many other Phylofophers, that have been of greateft fame^\nwere certainly great Magicians, 2S Orpheus^ ^ythagorM^ Empedodes ^ and the\nlike, as by thofe things that have been written otthem by feveral ancient\nauthors may be colledcd. But above all I give the pre-eminence to Apol-\nhnius Ihmeus ^ a man of later times ^\nand of whom we may Ipeak with\nmore confidence and certainty. This was the man whom ancient Hea-\nthens very tenacious of their former worfhip and fuperftitions , did pitch\nupon to oppofe unto Chrift. His Life hath been written by divers four\nof them were joyned together and oppofed to the four Golpels : and\nHierocksj a famous Phylofopher of thofe times, made a Collation of his\nMiracles with thofe of Chriils ,\nwho was anfwered by Eufebms^ yet extant.\nSure it is, they prevailed ^o much, that he was for a long time worfhipped\nby many, andinfundry places as a very God,- yea, by fome Roman Em-\nperors, as we find in Hiftory. fhtlojlratus hath written his Life in very\nElegant ftile (as T\/^ot\/wj judgedJ in 8 books, which are extant. And\nthough they contain many fabulous things, as any man may expedt by the\nundertaking, yet have they fo much truth and- variety of ancient learning,\nthat 1 think they deferve to be better known then commonly they arc\n*\nb\"^ :^..uotbeunderftood, I am fure, as they fliouldbe, by any tranfla-\ntion either Latine or French that ever I faw : Forthe'Parw Edition,though\nit boaft of great things (as the manner is) yet how little was performed\nmay eafily appear unto any that will take the pains to compare it with the\nformer edition of Mdus ; Which I (peak not to find fault but bccaufe I\nwifh that fome able man would undertake the work ; there is not any\nbook, by the Tranflations yet extant, that more needeth it. What ufc Sca-\nllger made of him, may appear by his frequent quotations in his Notes\n-upon EufebiHSj in the Hiftory of thole times. As for Jppollonitis his Mira-\ncles or wonderful Ads (which is our bufinefle here) though many things\nhave been added , fome, probably, done by Impofiure , ver I uo not fee\nhow it can be doubted but hedid many ftrange things by the help of 5\/7\/-\nr\\u^ which things may be judged by due oblervation of circumftances . as\nfor example. That being convented before Dowifww the Emperor in the pre*\nfence of many, heprefently vanifhed and was leenagrcat way off (at ^ute-\noli I think) about the fime time. That at the very time when i)omitian\nwas killed at \"l^pwe, helpakeof itpublickly and of the manner of it at E-\n^hefus : and fo of many others, which ieem to me (asuittomoft) almoft\nunqueftionable. The greatefl: wonder to me is, that fiich was his port and\noutward appearance of Sandity aud Simplicity, that even Chriftrans have\nthought reverently of him, and believed that he did his wt)nders by the\npower of God, orbyfecret Philofophy and knowledg of Nature not re-\nvealed unto other men. So Jujlim Martyr ^ one of the ancient Fathers of\nthe Church judged of him, as is well known. Moft later Phylofophers\nthat lived about Julians time , and before that, as alfo the Emperors them-\nfelves, many of them , were great Magicians and ]S(ecromancers , as may\nB 2 eafily\n\fi:he T'REFACE.\neafily appear, partly by their own writings , and partly by the Hiitoiy of\nthole times.\nI do very much wonder whether any man , being a Scholer ^\nand not\nftrongly prepofleiled, that doth not believe Spirits^ 6cc. can lay that he c-\nver read the books of Tryalsand Confeffions of Witches and Wizards, fuch\nI mean, as have been written by learned and judicious men. Such as, for\nexample , I account NichnJ ^^cni^ins^ his DcmonQlatria : ex judiciis capitalihus\n5^00 plus minus hormmim^ Sec. grounded eipecially upon the Confeilions and\nCondemnations of no leffe then 900 men and women in Lorraine within\nthecompalTe of few years. That he was a learned man, I think no body\nwill deny that hath read him ; and that he was no very credulous and luper-\nftitious man (though aPapift) that alfo is moft certain : and ihavewon-\ndred at his liberty many times. I know not how it is now in thole pla-\nces ;\nbut by what I have read and heard of the doings of Witches and Sor-\n\" cerers in Oem'Va and Sa^oy in former times ( I could lay fomewhat of my\n*'\nielf,how my life was prcferved there very ffcrangely ,\nbut my witnelTes are\n*'not,and I willnot brm? their creditin queftion tor fuch afeuiincffe.) I\nam of opinion. That he that fhould have maintained there tnac there was\nno fuch thing as Witches, or Spirits, &c. would have been thought by\nmoft either mad and brain-fick (fo frequent and vifible were the etleds to\nfober eyes) or a Witch himfelf. For '-.deed it is ordinary enough, that\nthofe that are lo really, are very willing ( which deceiveth many ) to be\nthought Impoftora , and there is good realon for it: I fliould (ooner fuf^\nped: him an Impoftor that doth profeffe himfelf (except it be by way of\nconfelfion , as many have done) and is ambitious to be counted a Witch or\nSorcerer. I remembe** I iaw a book fome years ago, intituled, T)e I'incon-\nJiance des 7nauvais Anges <(sr Demons^\nprinted at 'P^i\/'W 1612. in ^\u00ab4?fo, and ano-\nther of the fame Author, and (ize, intituled, L'incredidite 6^ jyiejcnauce du for-\ntile^e^Taris 1642. Strange il:ories are told there ot a Province of France , a-\nbout that time (or little before) marvelloully infefted with Witches and\nSorcerers, inlomuch that people did not know one another ( in lome\none place) in theitreecs, by reafon of evil Spirits appearing publickly inthe\nfhapcofmen; and that the proceedings ofjuftice ( which doth not hap-\npen.ofcen*) were fometimes difturbed by them. I think the Author him-\nielf was one that was lent to the place by the King with lome authority,and\nto make report. But as I do not altogether truil my memoiy, having had\nbut a fight of the books (it was at the Bdl in St. fauis Church-yard : ; So I\nbeleech the Reader not to reft upon this account that I give him upon my\nbeft remembrance,but to perufe the books himfelf. I am confident he may\nreceive good latisfa(5tion, being things that were not done in a corner , but\nvery publickly and well attefted as I remember. However the reader muft\ngive me leave ( though it be not to this purpoie, left my Ci-\nv^frVr'p*^^^' lencebe drawn to the prejudice of the truth) to tell him,thac\nI met with one gre.u fallhood there concerning my own ra-\nther (ofS\/. M.) which I have abundantly refuted, and all others of that\nnature, when I was yet very young. But that (as I conceive) which in all\ntfieieftories would moftpuzzle a rational man, is the fignes which are let\ndown\n\fThe T%EFACE,\ndown by many how witches may be known,as Teats ^\nfwhnm'mg upon the ipa-\nter^ dry cyes^ and the like : which things indeed have Tome ground of truth\nbeing limited to particular times and places, but are not of\ngeneral 'application. Mr. Vofiita had therefore realon to\ni3o'f|\/''\u00b0^\u00b0'\"^*^*\nfind fault with Springerus and 'Bodinus for making that a\ncertain token of a Witch that (lie cannot weep. Who alfb in the lame\nplace doth well except again ft the tryal o^ yuvM^Kiaiai, as he calls it (com-\nmonly, purgatioper aqiwn fri^idam) condemned by many.

But the reafons of fuch obfervations or marks\nthat are given by lomc, are lo ridiculous, that they would make a fbber\nman (that hath not patience enough to ponder all things diligently ) to\nfufped all the reft. So one tels us^ That when the Cock croweththe fo-\nlemn meetings ot Witches (which opinion perchance may prove ancient\nenough ; as we fliall fhew elfewhere) are diflblved : and he thinks a rea-\nfon may be becaufe of the crowing of the Cock in the Golpel, when St.\n(Pf-m- denyed Chriff. Another tells us.

'But I fhall have a more proper place for the full\nexamination of thcfe things in one of the two Treatiies before mentioned.\nIt cannot be denyed but. this whole bufinefle of Witches, what through\nignorance , what through malice, is very lyable to many miflakes and di-\nvers impoflures.

And\nindeed it lo fell out once in ^me^^s by Tlmie is recorded at large,Where when\nfpme afcribed iuch power unto Herbs, as though Sun and Moon had been\nfubjed: unto them, the dead might be raifed , armies vanquifhed , and\nwhatnot! which was not very well reliflied by many : atlallcame Jjcle-\npiades , who perfwaded men that were very well dilpofed to beperfwaded,\nthat all Phyfical ufe of Herbs and Simples was a meer cheat, and that men\nwere better want them, there being other means eafier and leffe trouble-\nfometo rcftore health and overcome difeafes , which heprofeffed to teach :\nand prevailed lofar for a while, that they were laid afide, and a new courle\nof Phyfick introduced.

I will forbear the names of many\nmen of fame and credit, Phylicians too, becaufe moft of them are named\n(\"and commonly enough known} by Sewmtm upon this occafion. There\nis one, whom I think interiour to none, though perchance not Co com-\nmonly known or read, and that is fieor^ius 1{aqujaiu4 a Venetian, who by his\nfir ft education and profeffion wasan Aftrologer, caft many Nativities, and\ntookupon'him to Prognofticate; but afterwards confcious tohimfelfof\nthe vanity of the Art (that is, when the Divcldoth not intermeddle, as al-\nwayes muft be underftood : for fome Aftrologers have been Magicians\nwithall, and have doneftrange things) gave it over, and hath writcen a-\ngainli: it very Learnedly and Solidly. Read him,if you pleafe^in his Chap-\nters Vc Mi^is^ Ve Oracidus; yea, through his whole Book DeDtvinatme ^2Lnd\nyou maybclatisfied what he thought of thcfe things : he alfo was a Phy-\nfician.

But before I give over, I willule one Argument which perchance\nmay prove of fome force and validity, and that is, Aconfideration ofthe\nit::.2^^ ^ f.; and evaiions and notorious abfurdities that chefc m^nare pun\nto.\n\fThe T'B^eF A\u00a38.\ntOjWho not being able to deny the a?\/ ,or matter o\/Ki^,wouldfcem to fay fomc-\nwhat rather then to acknowledg Spirits, and Divels^and Witchcraft; <Pompo-\nnatiusjWho hath not heard of ? I once had the book,I know not now what is\nbecome of it.But I remember well,I never was more w^eary of reading then\nwhen I read him ; nothing that ever I read or heard of j^egends and old\nwomans tales did feem to me more groundlefle and incredible. But be-\ncaufe thofc men bear themfelves very much upon the power of imagina-\ntion (which indeed is very great, and doth produce ftrange effeds) I fhall\ncommend to the fober Reader that hath not yet met with him , Tho. Fienus\nhis Learned Tradat , Ve yiribus Imaginat'mm , a very Rational and Philofo-\nphical difcourfe. Of their miferable fhifts and evafions in general, the\nAuthor or Obicrvator rather of Muf^.umVeronenfe ^\nbefore quoted, will give\nyou a good account. I have at this prelent in my hands the writings of\na Phyfician, Augerius ferrerius by name. What he was for a Phyfician I know\nnot,- all ( I doubt) of that profeffion will not allow very well of his Pre-\nface to his Cafttgdttoncs ^raEiictt Medicbi^^ whatever they think of the Cajli-\ngattones themfelves. But in general, his Stile, and various reading, and\nknowledge of good Authors, fpeak him a Learned man ruflficiently, T\/;\u00bb-\nanus in his Hiftory gives him a moft ample Elogtwn^ and makes him to have\nbeen Jul. C. Scaltger his intimate acquaintance and much refpeded by him.\nBut 1 doubt whether Thuams had ever feen this book of his : it doth not\nappear by that Elogiim that he had. Well , this Learned man in his Chap-\nter T)e Homerica (fo he calls it) Medicatione^ where he treats of cures done by\nCharms and Spels , by Words and Charaders, which others impute com-\nmonly to Witchcraft : firft, for the o^,, he doth not deny it : (Natn m qud\nfsnfbus expojita jmit c<^tra'Ytmre^ Jani btminis non eft.) He thinks them little\nbetter then mad men that will deny that which is approved by ^o vifiblc\nexperience. Yet it feems he was one of them that did not believe , or\nwould not believe ( though he doth not fay fo pofitively) Sinnts and Witch-\nts , and Supernatural Operations. What then ? he plainly maintaineth\nand argueth it (though he quote no Gofpel for it) that luch is the nature\nof the Soul of man (if he know how toule it) that by aftrong faith and\nconfidence it may work any miracle without a miracle: Verum confidentU\nilia^ acfirmaperjuajio ( that you may have fome of his words if you have\nnot the book ) comparatur mdoHls animis per opinionem quam de Qara^eribus is*\nJacrii Verbis conceperunt^ I)o\u00a3tis cr rerum intelliQenttam habentibns , ?uhil opus eji\nextermjed cogmta Vi ammi^p^r earn miracula edere poJJuntO'C. And again alittlc\nafter , VoHus vero <(sr fibi conflans folo verbo Janabit. I do not hence conclude\nthat this Ferrer ius ^\nthough he Ipeak as though he were, and names no body\nclfe , that he wasthefirll or only that hath been of this opinion. jh>icenne\nthe Arab was the firff,as I take it, that fet it on foot : fome others have fol-\nlowed him in it. Butlince theie men acknowledg the ftrange etFcCts that\nOthers deny, let the fober Reader judge whether of the two more likely td\ngrant 5pjr iff and Divels , or to make the Soul t)f man (of every man^ na-\nturally) either a God or a Divel. But let men take heed how they attempt ta\ndo Miracles by their flrong faith and confidence , for that is the ready way\nto bring the Divel unto them, and that is it which hath made many Witch-\nC c^\n\f\"The T \"RE FACE.\ncs and Sorcerers. As for that Faith whereby men did work Miracles in\nthe Primitive times, fpoken of in the Golpel, commonly CiiUed , The.\nFaith of Miracles , that is quite another thing ,\nwhich I fliall not need to\n{peak of in this place. Of a flrong confidence in God, even in them that\narc not other wile very godly, whether it may not, according to Gods firft\norder and appointment, produce fbmetimes iome ftrange eftecls ; we have\nhad a confidcration ellcwhere , where we treat of Trccatorie Emhufeajm. But\nthis alio is quite another thing, as may appear by what we have written\nof it.\nBut to conclude this part 5 upon due confidcration of the premifes, and\nwhat elfe I have inreadmefle upon the fame Subjc(it Cir God give me life\nand health) I cannot fatisfie my felf how any Learned man , fober and\nrational, can entertain fiich an opinion (fimply and lerioully) That there\nbe no Vivds nor Spirits^ &c. But upon this account which I give my felf\n(leaving all men to their own judgments herein) that if there beanyiuch\ntruly and really, it mull: needs be becauie being at firft prepolTeffed upon\nfomeplaufible ground^ and being afterwards taken up with other thoughts\nand employments, they are more* willing to ftick to their former opi-\nnion without further trouble, then to take the pains tofeek further.\ndides doth very well obferve. And when we lay, A Learned nwi^ there\nis much ambiguity in that word. For a man may be (not to Ipeak of\nthe ignorance of the common people, in thole climates efpecially, who\nthink all Learning concluded in ^Preaching \u2022 and now in thele times\ntoo , them beft Preachers that in very deed have leaft Learning , but\npreach by \/7i\/?\/;i^ and Injpkation ^ as they call it) but a man, I Tay, may\nDCzLear?ud Ma}ij a very Learned man in lomeone kind or profelfidn, even\nto Excellency and Admiration , who neverthelefie is and may be found\nignorant enough in other kinds : but a general Learned man is a thing of\na vaft extent, and not often leen. It is a bufmeffe of an infinite labour,\nbefides that it requireth Natural parts anfwerablc; without which (judg-\nment fpecially ) the more pains fometimes the more ignorance. I aim\nnot by this at any particular man or men (Deum tejlor) I would much rather\nfubmitto thecenfure ofothers my felf, then take upon me to ccnlureany ;\nbut the obfervation is of very good ule, I know it, and may give much la-\ntisfadion in many ca(cs,and have given an inftance ofit in Tertullia?ija.nd fomc\nothers ellcwhere.\nI have done for this time; I come now to the Objections, wherein I fliall\nnot need to be very long, becaufethey run much upon one thmg,Impofturc,\nwhich hath already been fpoken ofandanfwered. But yet fomewhat more\nparticularly fhal be anfwered.\nFirft, O^ Miracles. It cannot be dcnyed but the world is full ofhorrible\nImpoftures in that particular : Yet I believe , that fom.e fijpernatural\nthings , as cures , &c. do happen in every age , for which no rea-\nfon can be given , which alio for the ftrangenefl'e may be called Mi-\nracles. But if we limit (with moft) the word to thofe things that\nproceed immediately from God or divine power ; I fhall not be\nvery\n\fThe T^EFACS.\nvery ready to yield chat many fuch Miracles\" are '\nfecn in thefe Dayec>. ]^c\nI will not further argue the Cal.e in this place. Well, let us z^ko. Miradei\nin the ordinary Senfe : I v^'-'^y b^I^^'e that many fuch things do happen\nin many places J\nbut that through negligence partly, and partly throuoK\nincredulity ,\nthey are not regarded ohentimes, or. loon forgotten. And\nwifermen, fometimes, though they know or believe fuch thin-^^s v^c ^ixc\nnot they very torward to tell them, left they bring themlelves into con-\ntempt with ihorcfuppoled wile men, who will Iboner laugh at any thing\nthey do not underftand ,\nthen cake the pains to redifie' their ianorance or\ninform their judgments. 1 hope I fhall do no wrong to the Memory of\nthat Venerable , Incomparable Prelate , B i s h o p A n d r e w e s for\nSound Learning and True Piety whileft he lived, one of the greatcft Lights\nof this Land; if I fet down two Stories, which we may call Mitades\nboth which he -\"\"^ belir\"! to be true, but for one of them, it feemes he\ndid undertake upon his own knowledge : The one, concerning a njjki ,\nor at leaft by many lufpeded Witch or Sorcerefs, which theDivel,in a ft^ge\niliape, did wait i<po?i (or for rather) at her death. The other, concerniu'^a\nman , who after his death was reftored to life to make Confeilionof a\nhorrible Murder committed upon his own Wife, for which he had never\nbeen fufpc^ted -, bcth thefe, as he related them to my F. (in familiar con-\nvcrlation) and my F. did enter them for a remebrance into fomc of his\nMverfam. In the fubftance I believe there could be no miftake, but if there\nbe any miftake in any Circumfl:ances,as ofNames,or othcrwife , that muft be\nimputed to my F who was aftranger, not to the tongue only , but to all\nbulinelTes (more then what might be known by printed books^ and fuch\npublick Wayes) oiEngUnd^\nThcFiiitjthus:\nL.

So\nmuch of Miracles.\nOf Exorcijmes we mull fay as of Miracles. One notable example of a\ncounterfeit Polfeffion, and of great ftirs likely to have inllied u^on it in\nFrance^ we have out of Thuanm^ in our late Treatife of Enthuflajme. The Hi-\nflory of the Boy of 'Bilfon is extant ^ who by the Wiiclom and Sagacity of the\nR' R' F. in GodThomaSy Lord Bifliop of Lichfield and (jventry ^ wasdifco-\nvered to be an Impoftor on purpofe let up and fuborned to promote the Ro-\nmiili caufe, An. Vom. 1620. Such examples and ftories moft Countries have\nafforded good ftore, which arc extant in divers Languages. Neither muft\nit be concealed (by them that leek truth without partiality) that lome, once\ncalled VifciplinarianSj now more known by another name, have attempted\nto deal in thoie things, hoping thereby to gain great advantage to their\ncaufe. It was a famous Story in Q^Eli:^abeth's Reign, though now per-\nchance out of the knowledg of many, and beyond the remembrance of any\nliving, how one Mr. D. a very -zealous man of that Se<5t, did take upon\nhim by long prayers to call out Divels .\n'^ .xuintained and ailerted with\ngreat veh^ncncy by him and fbme others that favoured that caufe, though\nupon legal examination they proved otherwile , which occafioned many\nbooks on both fides in thofe dayes, but two, meliorismta ^ as we fay, writ-\nten by Dr. H. concerning Exorcifnes the one againft Papifts, the other a-\ngainft QP. I have them both fomewhere yet, I hope, but can not come at\nthem'\n\fThe T'F^EFJCE,\nthem at this time, which is the caufe that I cannot particularize that bu-\niineflewith circuraftances of times, and names or perft)nsas I would. But\nthere were many other books written (fomevery big, which I havefeen )\nabout it , as I laid betore j\nfo that the whole bufinefle , with very little in-\nquifition, if any have a mind, may quickly be found out. One Book-\nfeller in Little Sr\/fJzVi did help mc to the fight of fix or leven at once, yet\none of the books then written, and as I was told, upon this occafion much\ncommended unto mc by Ibme very Learned, to wit, Dr. Jordan^ of the\nSujfocation of the Matrix^ I long fought before I could meet with it. And\nfuch was the ignorance of iome Booklellers, that I could not perfwade them\nthere was any fuch book extant: but now at laft I have got it. All the\nule I fhall make ot it at this time is\u00bb that whereas the whole drift of the book\ntends unto this, tofllew the error of many in alcribing natural difeales to\nfupernatural caules , which might bethought by (bme to favour their o-\npinion that believe not Wttches^ Sec. The Author doth very prudently and\npioufly make this profe\/Tion inthe Preface, I ilo not deny but that God doth in\nthefe dayes work extraordinarily for the deliy^erance of his children^ and for other ends\nkji hiioivn to him\/elf ;\natui that among other there may be both poffefsions by the DiVel^\nand ohfejiions^ and Witch-craft, &c. and dfpoJJ'efsion alfo through the Prayers and Slip-\nplications of his jeryants^ which is the only }?ieans left unto usfor our relief in that cafe^\nhut fuch examples being<ver-f rare now adayes. Sec. V^rf^r all this I do not con-\nclude that Mr. D. was guilty of any Impofturc : he might do it through\nignorance being cozened by others. I have heard he was anhoneft man,\nand dyed pioully , and dilclaimed to the very laft that he did any thing in\nthat buimelTe otherwiie then Bona Fide. I would judge charitably, even\nof thoie men that ate not guilty of much charity towards others, whofe\njudgments and conlciences will not fufFer them (though men of approv-\ned worth and piety otherwiie) to lay as they lay, and to do as they do in\nall things. Be it granted therefore, that this bufinefle of Exorcifmes is ly-\nabletomuch Impollure : however, no man that hath read the relations\nof men and women pofleft, in leveral places, with due obfervation of cir-\ncumftances , iome of which relations, befides other perlons of credit, have\nbeen atteiled j^\nyea, Ibme penned and publifhed by learned Phyficiansand\nNaturalifts, who have been employed about the Cure, fiblerved their car-\nriage, heard fome of them fpeak ftrange Languages : lilly women pofleft,\ndilcourlc of highcft points of Phyloibphy, or the Mathematicks and the\nlike. No man, I lay, that is not a ftranger to thele things (befides what\nfome Travellers, no way interefledin the caufe, can aver upon their own\nknowledge) will make any queftion either of the real poflcffion of divers,\naccordmg to relations that have been made, or of the Divels (peaking in\nthem and by them when they have been Exorciledj and iometimes upon\nbare conference. And though feme Proteftants are of.opmion, That it is\nnot lawful or warrantable for any man to take upon him to Exorciie upon\nfuch occafions, that is, (as I conceive) by way of abiblute power and au-\nthority ,. and by luperftitious wayes and means, as is ordinarily done :\nYet where a man hath a Calling, as it he be lawfully Called to the Mini-\nftry^ and fee over fuch a Parifh where any happen to be poifefled (as in-\ndeed\n\fnhe T 'R E F AC E.\nB.

Reafonand Senfe that other men go by, they think the acorns\nthat the'old world fed upon j\nfools and children may be content with them\nbut they fee into things by another Li^k.

For the Truth then, and Sincerity or 'Reality of the Ela-\ntion in this fenfe, I fhall firft appeal to the Book it felf.

Not but that all the reft, even to the end,\ndoth help very well to \"confirm the truth and reality of the whole Story :\nbut becaufe 1 chink there is fo much in any fourth part, if diligently read^and\nwith due confidcration, that I defpair of his aflent,that is not convidied by-\nit.

But that was\nwritten I mull confefs, long before his Communication with Spirits:\nyet it isfomewhacto know what opinion he had then of them that deal\nwitk Divels and evil Spirits. But after he was made acquainted, and in\ngreat dealing's with them, and had in readincfs divers of chcfchis books,\nor others o? the fame Argument, containing their ieveral conferences\nand communications, to rhew, and the manner of their -appearing cxadlly\nfct down \u2022 obferve, I pray, with what confidence he did addrefs himfelf\nto the areateft and wileft in Europe. To Queen Elizabeth often , and to\nher Council, as by many places of this Relation doth appear ;\nbut more\nparticularly by his Letter to Sir Frmcis Walfingham^ Secretary, &c. That\nhe did the like to Kins; >\u00bbJeJ and his Councel, may eafily be gathered by\nthe Records (in this %eUtm) of 1607. but much defedive.

And truly, this one thing (aswc\nfaid before) excepted , his miftaking of evil Spirits for good, it doth not\nappear by any thing but that he had his underftanding, and the perfe^c\nuCe of his Rcafon to the very laft, as well as he had had any time of his\nlife.\nAgain, let it be confidered, that hecarryed with him where eVer he went\nA Stone which he called hh Jn^dicall Sione., as brought unto him hy an Ah-\noel but by a Spirit fun enough ,\nwhich he fihewed unto many ; to the Emperor\namong others, or the Emperors Deputy, Dr. C\u00ab''fi\", as I remember : But more\nof this Stotie afterwards.

The very word Jpparition doth rather\nimport the contrary. All I underiiand by 'Sjalicy, is, that what things ap-\npeared , they did fo appear by the power and operation of Spirits, adually\nprefcnt and working , and were not the eflFeds of a depraved fancy and\nimagination by meer natural caufes. By which, ilrange things, I con fels,\nmay be prefcnted and apprehended too, (ometimes by the parties with all\nconfidence , as we faid before, though all be but fancy and imagination.\nBut all circumftances well confidered, make this Cafe here to be ot another\nnature ^ and it may be it was the policy of thefe Spirits to joyn tipo of\npurpofe in this bufinefs, to make the truth and reality of it the more un-\nque-\n\f7he T PREFACE,\noueftionable ,\u2022 hoping (if God had given way) they fliould havepafTed, uk\ntime for good Spirits abroad generallyj and then we fhould have lecn what\nthey would have made of it.

According to Dr. Dee's own relation here, I^?i.2)ow. i^Sj.Jprilj^\nTrebonit : in the particulars of his Son Arthur's Con[ecra(ion (after his manner\nwhich he calls, Hn ojf\neying and prefentirig of him to the fervice of God: ) Uriel\n(one of his chiefeft Spirits) was the author of their ConjunBion: but when\nand howithapned (being but obiter mentioned there) we do not find any\nwhere ; and more then what I find here I have nothing to fay : For certain\nit is by this whole ftory ^ from the beginning to the end of it, that ^lley\nwas a great Conjurer , one that daily converfed by fiich art as is uled by\nordinary Vlagicians, with evil Spirits, and knew them to be Co.

Should we wonder if it had the lame event in Dr.\nDee 'though otherwife, as he doth appear tons, innocent, and well qua-\nlified? That this w^as his caie and error, I will appeal to hisownconfef-\niion (though he makes it his boaft) in more then one of his Letters orad-\ndrefles, where he profeCfeth , That for diyersyears he had been an earnejl Juter un-\nto God in prayer for Wifdom-^ that is, as he interprets himielf. That he might un-\nderfland the fecrets of Is.ature that had not been reVeakd unto men hitherto ; to the\nend ashe profedeth, and his own deceitful heart it maybe fuggefted un-\nto him That he vvght glorlfe God-^ but certainly, that himfelf might become\na, vlorious man in the worfd, and be admired, yea, adored every where almoft,\nas hernight befureitjivould be, had hecompalTed his delire. And what\ndo wethmk fliould put him upon fuch a defire, with hopes to obtain it,\nbut an opinion he had of himfelf as an extraordinary man, both for: parts ^\nand for favour with God ? But however , had he been to the utmoft of what\nhe could think of himfelf, befides his Spiritual pride of thinking io of\nhimielf (as great a fin as any in the eyes of God ) his praying for fiich a\nthing with fo much importunity, was a great tempting ot God, anddeferv-\nine <Treatefi: judgments.

Befides, it is lawful,\n(nay fit) for a man to pray for Gods blefiing upon his labours, for com-\npetency of wit and capacity that he maydo well in his vocation and glori-\nfie God. But for a man to afpircto fuch eminency above other men, and\n~by means that are not ordinary (as that conceited fhylo\/ophers Stone ^ and the\nlike) and to intereft God by earneft folicitations in his ambitions extrava-\ngant defires; that God, who hath faid of himielf, l%it herefijieth the proud\n^\nbut giVeth grace untt the humble , muft needs be fo great and fo high a provoca-\ntion (if well confidered) ^s that I begin to doubt whether it be charity to\npity him that fuffered fo juftly and defervedly. 1 do not know but it is\nas lawfuU few: any man obfcurely born to pray tor a Kingdom ,- for a\nCommon Souldier that he may have ftrength to encounter thoulands, or\nf<ir an ordinarie Maid , that flie may become the faireft of women.

Such examples Ecclefiafiir\ncal Story will afford,and other books of that nature, but I have them not at\nthis time, and I conceive I have faid enough to this particular.\nBut of his ^rayiio too, fomewhat would be obferved. His Spirits tell him\nromcwi?erc,thathehadthe Gift of Graying. Truly I believe he had, a^it is\nordinarily called : that is, that he could expVefs himlelfvery fluently and ear-\nneftly in Prayer,andthat he did it often to his own great contentment. Lee\nno man wonder at this,- I havs, riiuwcd elsewhere that Ibme that have been\nvery wicked, yea, fome that dyed for blafphcmy, and with blalphemy in\ntheir mouth to the laftgafp, have had it in a great meafure, and done m^uch\nmiichief by it. It is no dilparagement to Prayer, no more then it is to the\nbeft things of the world (and what better and more heavenly then prayer well\nu(ed r ) it cheybe abuied. Aid it is commonly ob(erved,that the corruption\nof beft things is moft dang^>ous. What bred thole pernicious hereticks\nthat folong troubled the world, and could notbefiippreftedbutby abfoluce\ndeftruction , but long affected prayers ( therefore called \u00a3Ko';im or xVff\/jQ\/ww,\nthat IS to lay,the ^^rayen) and Enthufiafms ? And as to that point oi: ml\\?iird\njoy and compiacency , which fome Schifmaticks and wicked men find ia\nE them-\n\fThe T\\SF AC E.\nihcmfclves at their prayers, which ignorant deluded people think to be an\nargument of the Spirit : It io ^cxiaiii,and is a myftcry ofnature that hath(*may\nI ipeak it without bragging ) been brought to light ( of late years at\nleaft) by my felf and fully dilcovercd , *That not only the inward heat of\n\" mental conception (where there is any vigor) but alio the mufick of ^ut-\n*'\nward words, is able to occafion ic. Indeed it is a point that doth deferve\nto be wellconfidcredof in thefe times efpecially. For when young boyes\nand illiterate men (and the number is likely toincreale now that CattcUzing\nis fo much negleded) are turned loofe toexercife thcmfelvesin this gift (as\nthey call it) and when by long practice they have attained to fome rcadinefs\nand volubility jWhich doth occafion fome inward lightfomenefs and excita-\ntions, or perchance lomcwhatthat may have lomc relemb lance to fpiritual\nIbrrow and compunction, they prefently think themfelvesinfpiredj and lb\nthey become Saiuuht^oxt they know what it is to be Qlnjliam. And if\nthey can Pray by inspiration, why not Preach alfo ? So comes in Ambaptifm\nby degrees, which willbetheruine of all Religion and civil Government\nwhere ever it prevails . And I believe that this fond foolifh conceit of Tnfpi-\nration^ as it hath been the occafiou of much other mifchief, fo of that horrid\nfacriledge , fl\\all I call it, or profanation ( I hope I may do either with-\nout ofiPence, for it is not done by any pubhck Authority that I know\nof) thecafting andbanifhing of The Lords Prayer out of manypri-\nrate hou fes and Chuiches; then which, I think, Chrift never received a\ngreater alf: ont from any that called themlelves Chriftians. I am not fb uno'ia-\nritable as to believe that it is done in dire(5b oppofition to Ghrift by any re-\nal Chriftians, but in a furious zeale by many, I believe, againft let prayers.\nBut this is not a place to difputc it : Certainly , as the Lords Prayer is a\nPrayer of moft incredible comfort. to them that ufe it devoutly and upon\ngood grounds (a good foundation of Religion and found Faith, I mean) fb\nI believe that fct Prayers in general are ot more concernment to the fct-\nling of Peace in the Commonwealth then many men are aware of.\nBut let this pafs for my opinion; there be worie I am lure thAt pals \u2022\ncurrently.\nAgain, A man may wonder (I cannot tell whether an objedion may\nbe made of it) that Dr. Dec, though he were at the firft deluded fto which\nhis own pride and prefumption did expofe him ) as many have been ;\nyet afterwards in procefs of time when he found himfelf fb deluded and\nfhufHed with j when Edward i^elley did ufe fiich pregnant arguments to\nhim (as he did hiore then once) to perfwade him that they were evil Spirits\nthat appeared unto them ^ nay,when he had found by certam experience, that\nhis Spirits had told him many lies, foretold many things concerning Princes\nand Kingdoms , very particularly limited with circumftances of time\n,\nwhich when the time was expired did not at all come to pafs j\nyet for all\nthis he durft pmn his Soul for them that they were good Spirits ,\nand con-\ntinued in his confidence ( fb farre as our Relation goes) to the hi\\. I\nanfwer, SwvL io the power of this kind of Spiritual delufion, it doth fo pof-\nfcfs them whom it hath once taken hold of, that theyfeldoni, anyofthem^\nrecover themfelvcs. In the dayes o^Martin Luther (a great and zealous refor-\nmer-\n\f7be THE FACE.\nmer of Religion , but one chat would have detcftcd them as the wdrft of\nInfidels that had u(ed the Lords Trayer^ as fbme have done in our dayes, as\nappcArsby whatheiaith of it in more then one place) there lived one Micha-\nel btifeiim, who applying to himfelf fome place of the ^pocalypfe ^ took up-\nDQ. him to Prophecy. He had foretold that in theyear of the Lord 1555.\nbefore, the zgo't September the end of the world, and Chrifls coming to\nJudgment wouU be. He did fliew io much confidence, that fome write,\niMtJxt himfelf was fomewhat ftartled at the firft. But that day pall, he came\n;^ fecond time to Luther with new Calculations, and had digefted the whole\nbulincfs into zz. Articles, thecffe^of which was to demonftrate chat the\nend of the world would be in OBokr following. But now LMf\/;(fr thoughc\nhe had had tryal enouglp, and gave fo little credit to him ^ that he\n(though he loved the manj filenccd hiiTwfor a time-, whichour Apocalyp-\ntical Prophet took very ill at his hands, andwondred much at his incredu-\nlity* Weil, that moneth and lome after that over, our Prophet ( who had\nmade no little ftir in the Country by his Prophecying) was caft intoprilon\nfor hisobftinacy. After awhile \/-\u00abf\/;ervifitcd him, thinking by that time\n\u2022to find him ol another mind. But fo yfar was he from acknowledging his\nerror, that he down right railed at LMf\/;er for giving him good counlcl. And\nXome write that to his dying day (having lived to cheageof 80. years) he\nnever recanted. And was not this the cale of learned rojtc\/my, who fallen\ninto fome grievous wild fancies in his latter daycs, though found enough\nflill in other things , could never be reclaimed though means were ufed\nfrom time to time the beft and gentleft (in refpedto his worth and perfbn )\nthat could be thought of? But what talk we of particular men ? Con-\nfider che Anaha^tijh in s^cnev^}. Above an hundred years ago chey croybled\nGermany \\cry much: it coft many thoulands their lives. They roved up and\ndown. No looner deftroyed in one place but they fprung (whilefl: that lea-\nIbn laftcd) in another. Their pretences every where were the fame \u2022 (?^\u00ab-.\nVelations and the Spirit : the wickednefs ot Princes and Magiftrates , and\nChrijljijiis to he jet up in his Throne. Well, at la ft they were deftroyed in moft\npl^es. Stories of them have been written in all Languages, read every\nwhere, and their lamentable end. Can all this hinder but that upon every\nopportunity ol a confuted and confounded Government, they ftarc up a-\ngain m the fame Ihape and form as before ; the fame pretences, the (ame Scri-\nptureSjfor all the world,milerably detorted and abuled, to raiie tumults and\nledicions in all places. Such is the wretchedncfs of man that is once out oE\nthe right way of Rcalon and Sobriety. But withall we rauft (ay in this\nparticular cafe of Dr. Vees^ though his obftinacy was great and marvellous,\nyet it muft be acknowledged, that great was i\\iz diUgefKe and fubtility of his\nSpirits to keep their hold : and (ome things fometimes happened ( as his\ndanger and prefervation about Cra'vefend^ when he firft , here related, went\nout of the Realm) very {lrangcly,and fuch was the unhappinels of his mif-\napplycd zeal, that he made a Providence of whatloever hapned unto him\nasnedehred.\nSo much for Dr. Dee himfelf. But of his Spirits a greater queflion per-\nchance may be moved: If evil wicked, lyins Spirits (as we have reafon\nE %\n\"'^'^^\nCO-\n\fThe TTS^SF ACE.\nu\nto believe , and no man I think will queftion ) how Came they to be fuch\nperfwaders'to Piety and godlinefs, yea, fuch preachers of Chrift, his Incar-\nnation, his Pafhon, and other Myftenes ot the Chriftian Faith, not only\nby them here acknowledged, bat in fome places very Scholaftically fet out\nand declared' ? It fcemeth fomewhat contrary to reafon and as contrary to\nthe words of our Saviour, Byery Kingdom divided agatn\/l it \/elf, Scc^ But\nfirfl: to the matter of fad : The Divels we know even in the Gofpel did\nacknowledg, nay, in tome manner proclaim Chrift to be the Son ofGod :\nwhich is the main Article he did gonteft with Chrift by Scripture Autho-\nrity- and by S.*P^M\/i teilimony, can transform hi mfelf, when he lift into\nan Anc^el of light. And in fome relations well atteftcd, of Pofleftions\nand publickExorcifms that have been ufed; wegnd the Divel often fpcak-\ning by the mouth of women, vuha like a Monk out of the Pulpit ,\nper-\nfwading to temperance, rebuking vices, expounding ofmyfteries ,\nand the\nlike then as one that were an enemy to truth and godlinels. Infomuch\nthat fome have been ready to make a great myftery and triumph of it,\nthereby to convia Hereticksand Atheifts, in time, more effcdually , then\nthey have been by any other means that have been uled hitheito : and af-\ncribincT the whole bufinefs not to the Divel himielf, but the great power\nand Providence of God^ as forcing himagainft his will to beaninftrumenc\nof his Truth. For my part, I fee cauie enough to believe that fuch things,\nthe re contained at large, might come from the Divel ; that is, might tru-\nly and really be fpoken by perfons poflefied and infpired by the Divel.\nBut that they are impleyed by God to that end, I fhall not eafily grant.\nI rather fufped that whatioever comes from them in that kind, though it\nbe good in it ielf, yet they may have a mifchievousend in it- and that I\nbelieve will Toon appear if they can once gaincfomuch credit among men\nas CO be believed to be lent by God to bear teftimony to the truth. A man\n.may fee fomewhat already by thole very Relations , and that account that is\ngiven us there. And therefore I do not wonder if even among the more\nIbber Piipifts this projeit (as the relater and publiOier complaineth; hath\nfound oppofition. The Divel is very cunning ;\na notable Polititian. 5.\n^aul knew him fo, and therefore he ufes many words to fet out his frauds.\nHecan lay. the foundation of aplot, if need be, ahundred years before the\neffeds fliali appear. But then he hath his end. It is not good truftingof\nhim, or dealing with him upon any pretence. Can any man fpeak bet-\nter then he doth by the mouth of Anabaptifts and Schifmaticks ? And this\nhewiil dofor many years together if need be, that they that at firft flood\npff may be won by time. But let them be once abiolute maft^rs ,\nand\nthen he will appear in his own fhape. There is one thing which I Won-\nder much more at in thofe Relations I have mentioned ,\nand that is, that\nthe Divel himfclf fliould turn fuch a fierce accufer: of chepi that haVe\nferved him fo long. Witches and Magicians. I know he aoth^here fo too\nin fome kind , in more then one place. He doth iii'uch inveigh agiinft\nDivels \u00abnd all that have to do with them ,\nMagicians, Sec. But that is\nin general only, or in IQlley's particular cale , upon whom he had a-\nnotha: hold , which he made more reckoning of\u2022, to-'wit , as he ap-\npeared\n\fThe T^BFAC^'\npeared to them as an Angel of light. Any thing to maintain his interefl.\nthere, and their good opinion of him ;\nfor he had great hopes from that\nplot. But that he fliould purfue fb ridgedly particular men and women\nwhom he had ufed fo long, to death, and do the part of an informer a-\ngainfl: them , may feem more like unto a Kingdom divided againft it lelf,\nbut it is not our cafe here ;\nneither am I very well fatisfied , that whac-\nfbever the Divcl faith or layesto the charge of them by whol^ mouth he\nfpeaketk , ought to be received for good teilimony. Here it may hcWierim\nhad fome reafon ,- for I doubt ibme have been too credulous. But this by\nthe way fliall iuffice.\nThat the Divel fliould lie often, orbe miftakenhimfelf, in his Troche-\ncieSj as by many particuiars of this Relation will appear , I wall not look\nupon that, as if any objediion could be mad^of it. But it may be won-\ndred ,\nperchance , Dr. Dee being often in lb great \"^anc of monks ,\nthat he\ndid not know which way to turn^ what fhitt to make ; at which time\nbe did alwayes with much humility addrefs hinafelf to his Spirits, making\nhis wants known unto them \u2022 and the Divel on the other fide ,\nboth by\nhis ownboalbng, and by the teftimonieof thole whocould not lie, having\nthe goods of this world (though ftiU under God) much at his difpofing ,\nand alwayes, as he feemed, very delirous to give Dr. 'Dee all polTible fatis-\nfa^lion that in this cale , once or twice perchance excepted, when the\nDr. was well furniilied (for which the Spirits had his thanks) at all other\ntimes he was flill , to his very great grief and perplexity , left to himfelf\nto fhift as he could, and fome pretence, why not otherwile fupplyed, cun-\nningly deviled by them that were lb able, and to whom he was io dear.\nBut I miift remember my felf; I laid fo ablej but in fome places his Spi-\nrits tell him plainly. It was not in their power , becaufe no part of their\nCommilsion, or becaule it did not belong unto them (fuch as dealt with\nhim,) to meddle with the Trcafurcs of the earth ; and (ometimes that\nthey were things beneath their cognizance or intermedling. Of the diffe-\nrent nature of Spirits, we fliall lay ibmcwhat by and by^ that 'may have\n>^mc relation to this alio, perchance. But granting that the Divel gene-\nrally hath power enough both to find mony and to gratific with it where\n,he feeth caufe. Yet in this cale of Witches and Magicians, dired: or in-\ndire^^t , it w ttfiMm and obfaved by many as an argument of Gods great TroVidence\noyer men^ thatgenerally he hath not : It is in very deed a great Argument of a\nfuperiour over-ruling power and Providence. For it men ot all ptofef-\nfions will hazard (their Souls) fo far as we lee daily to get money and\ncftates by indired: unconfcionable wayes , though they are not alwayes\nHire , andthat it be long oftentimes before itcomes,, and oftentimes prove\nthpir ruine^ even in this world, through many cafualties ; as alterations\n^.of times, and the like : what would it be if it were in the power of the\n.;P. to help every one that came unto him, yielding but to Inch and fuch\nr;;Condit!ons, according as they Cv^v^Ul agree i\nHitherto I have confidered what I thought might be objeded by others-\nI have one obje^ion tnore, vvl.lca to me was more conlidcrable (as an obje-\nction, I mean, not Co readily anfweredj then all the reft : Devils , we think\ngene\n\f'The 'P\\EFACB,\ngenerally, boch by their nature as Spirits, and by the advantage of loijg\nexperience Tavjery great advantage indeed in point of knowledgj cannot but\nhave perfed knowledg of all natural things, and all fecrets of Nature, which\ndo not require an infinite underftanding; which by that meafureofknoWc-r>\nledge that even men have attained unto in a little time, is not likely to bf\nfoneceflary in moft things.

As for that conceit of the tongue which was fpokeri by Muryi in Para'\ndifc,wc have already laid that it is no late invention j and I make noquefli-\non but it proceeded from the fame Author.

But it may be too the Spirits did not intend they fhould\nbe taken for the fame, becaufe exploded by learned men, and therefore altered\ntht forms and figures of moft of them of purpofe that they might fcem new,\nand take the better. So that in all this the Divel is but ftill conftant unto him-\nfelf,and this conftancy ftands him in good ftead,toadd the more weight and\nto gain credit to his Impoftures. Not to be wondred therefore if the fame\nthings be found elfewhere , where the D. hath an hand.\nWith Cabaliftical writings we may joyn Chymical^ here alfo mentioned m\nmany places.

Sure enough it is,that not oply Dr.\nZ^t'e, but others alio who had part of that precious Tot^der brought unto them by\nSpirits^ and expeded great matters of it, were all cheated and gulfd (and I be-\nlieve it coft fome of them a good deal of money ;\nTtince T{oj'emberg particular-\nly) by thole Spiritual Chymifts. Let them confider of it that have been deal-\ning in luch things as they fljall lee caiife.\n\fThe Trefnce,\nSo ilill wc fee, that in all thefe things, a'= we faid before, the Divel is not be-\nholding to others, (as might be(ufpc6tcd) but others ha\\c been beholding to\nhim: As for his Divinity, i nhighcft pomes, if he fpakc the truth, it was for\nhis own ends, as we faid before : He can do it, who makes any quellion ?\nIn contro\\ crted points, wc may obferve, chat he doth fer've thefcene aod prefcnc\noccafion i\nand I make no queil;on,but had Dr. Dee^onc to ConjiantinopleiZnd\nbeen entertained there with refpcd:, his Spirits there would ha\\ c fliewed them-\nfelves as good Mahometans^ as clfewhere good Roman Catholicks^ or Troteftants.\nWe have fomewhere a very pretty Tale, (I would fay a curious Obfervation\nif I thought it true) concemingthenature of the Serpen tor Addar, handfomly\ncxpreflcdj how flie tra'neth her yong ones to fct them out abroad into the world\nthat they may (hift for themfelv es. Twenty days, as I remember, are foent in\nthat work: Now whether it be {^o really^, I cannot fay certainly, but I fufped:\nit. It is not in Ariflotle^ and I looked in Aldroi\/andffs^ and I could not findc\nit: But whctheritbcfo or no, let no body wonder; forthis was the maner of\nPreaching formerly (and may be yet perchance in fome places) amiOng Monki\nand Fryars in great requeft. They would make a ftory of Man, or Bcafts, as\nthey thought fit themiclves, and their Fancies belt ferved ; pretty and witty, as\nmuch as they could j whether it had any ground of truth, or no, no man re-\nquired ; Thc.moralization was good. If the Divel have done fo here it was\nnot through ignorance (for he is too good a Naturalift; and I believe there is\nfomewhat even in Nature, though we know it not, why both in facred and pro-\nphanc H:ftory, Spiritsand Serpents are (b oftenjoy ncd) of which is true and\nreal; buias hath been faid, it Icrvcd his turn, and that is enough. And al-\nthough, having confidcred it as an Objcdlion, how the Divel comethto fpeak\nfomuch truth, as will be found in this Book; no man, I think, will expcd I\nftiould give an account of any falfc Doctrine or Divinity, that ic rqay\ncontain: Yet one point I think fit to take notice of, and proteft againft it ; as\nfalfe, erronious, and of dangerous confcqucnce , and that is, where ic is\nfaid, That 4 wd\u00ab (in fome cafes) may kill another man (Vrinceor other\") without\napparent canfe, or lawful Authority, and therefore pnnifhable by the Laws of\nMan 5\nwho ne^erthelefs^ may expeB a great reward at the hands ofGod for his\naB : HJ w this may agree with the Principles of New Lights, and Anabaptifti-\ncal Divinity, I know not; it is very contrary to the Principles of that Ortho-\ndox Divinity, lately profcfTcd and cftabhfhed by Law in \u00a3\u00abg\/^ff^\/.\nI have^now faid in this main Objediion, (as I apprehended it) what I think\nwas molt proper and pertincnt,and I hope may fatiffie. But I have fbmewhat clfe\nto Dy, which in this cafe of Di'vels and Spirits in general, I think it \\ery confi-\nderable, and may fatisfie perchance, in (omc cafts, where nothing elfe can.\nWe talk of Spirits, and read of Spirits often, but I think it is \\ery litde\nthat we know (thebeft ofusall) of them, oftheir nature or dififercnces : And\nhow then can it be expeded that we Aiould refolve all doubts ? And though I\nthink it is not much that any man ever knew and rightly apprehended, or can,\nas he is a man, in this bufinefs ; yet my opinion is, (though I know it is much\ngainfaidand oppofed) that ancient Tlatonick Phylofophcrs of the latter\ntimes, underftood much more then moft ChriRians; I do not write this,\nas though I thought, or would have any thought by others to be the worfc\nehrillians for being ignorant in thefe things ; but rather, in my opinion, any\nF maw\n\f7 he Treface,\nman thcbettcr Chrlftian,by much, who dgth not regard it or dcfire ic : For my\npart, although I mail acknowledge that fomc fcriiples of my minde,did induce\nmcto lock into many Book ,, unc 1 1 wasfatisficd, which otherwifel liad never\ndone i\nyet I profcf^ to believc,ihat it ib (o little that can be known by man jn this\nfubiedt, andfubiedt to fo muchillufion, as that I think no Rudy ismore\\ain\nand foolifti i\nand that I would noBgo three i\\cp^ out of my doors (more then\nwhat Ididtofatisfie myminde in fomc matters of Faith, if anyluch fcruplc\ndidari(e) roknowasmuchasthcprofoundcilPlatonick. or Phylofopher yea,\nor Magician oF them all ever knew.

God knows how many\ndeforces there maybe between thcfc but we cannot know it; neither doth ic\nconcern our falvation, for which we have reafon to praife God: But if ic\nwere fo, that all Sj?\/r\/>j\" are either Divels or Angels,, what Qiall we make of\nthcfc that are found in mines, of which learned As^ricola hath written ; of\nihofe that have been time out of mindc called ^u'\/S^Ao\/, (from whence pro-\nbably, as wc have faid clfewhcre, Gobelin in Englifti is derived) who live in\nprivate Houfes, about old Walls, and Ifaiks of Wood, harmlefiotherwifc, bun\nvery thievifli, fo frequent and fo known m fuiuc Countrcys, that a man may as\nwell doubt whether there be any Horfes in Unglandy becaufc there are none\nin fomc parts of the World ; not found in all America, I think, till fomc were\ncarried thither : Neither can I believe, that thole Spirits that pleafe themfelves\nin nothing clfc but harmlefs (ports and wantonncfTe, fuch as have been known\nin all Ages 5 fuch as did ufe to (have the hairs of Flinim Secimdm his Ser-\nvants in the Night, ashimfelf relates (a very creditable man, I am fure) in his\nEpiltles, and the like; that fuch Spirits, I fay, have any relation either to\nHeaven or to Hell : We might infifl: in more particulars-, but wc do not dcfirc\nto dwell upon it at this time j and there is yet fomewhat clfe to be (aid : And\nwhat\nt\n.\n\fl^he Treface,\nwhat I have faid of fome Platonicks, I did not intcud thereby to juftificall\ntheir abfurd or fuperftitious Opinions in this Argument of Spirits: As they\nhave fcarchcd farther into it then others (befides damnable experience, havino-\nconfouiided Magickwith Phylofophy, yea ahr.oft turned all Phylofophy in-^\ntoMagick) fo it was confequent, they would fall into moreHrrors and Ab-\nfurditiesi yet withal, they have found fomcwhac that doth better agree with\ndaily experience, .then what is comrtionly known or believed.

A man\nwould think at fir if, perchance, ihatit wasfomewhat outward, but it will be\nfound otherwife ; it was fecn in the Stone, and appeared of different forms and\ncolours, as they that read will quickly finde.\nNext unto thcfcthc Holy Table is chiefly conCderable, ordcriiag of it is re-\nferred to Dt'Dee, which hedarlt not take upon himfclf^ until he had war-\nrant from his Spiritual Teachers : This Table, which may well be called Ma-\ngical, is prefervcd and to befeen in Sir Thomas Cottons Library, (from whence\nwe had thercR) and byhisleave ishcrcrcprefentcd inabrafs Cutj mention is\nmade of it, as I take it, where Dr. D^e propofeth to hisTeachersj Whether\n}he Table (for the middle crofs of uniting the 4 principal parts') be madeperfeSi\ncr m : You may fee more of it, it is alfo called League Table, Table ofCo'venant,\nvtenfa foederis in fome piaces\n:\n\" The Pedefial of it is mentioned in two or three\nplaces, and in:leed a very curious Frame belonging unto it-, yet to be fcen in the\nfaid L'brary.

The Reader ,\nthat will be fo curious, by careful reading may foon finde it out j I was not\nwilling to bellow too much time upon it.\nBut here remainetha main buhncfs whereof wc are to give an account to\nthe Reader; There were many Tables or Schemes at the end of the Bock,\ncontaining Letters, a.b. e.&'C. difpofed into little fquares, with an Infcrip-\ntion over each Table in that unknown Charader (b.efore fpokenof) exprciled\ninufial Letters how it (hould be read^ There is one for a Specimen here at\nthe end of the Preface ; the re!! wcreomitted^ becaufe it was judged needlefs,\nexcept it were to increafe the price of the Printed book. For firit, Dr. Dee\nhimfclf though he took a great deal of pains to underftand tlie Myftcry of\nthem, and had great hopes given him from time to time to reap the benefit\n(himfelf complains of it in more then one place) of his toilfome work and\nlong patiei^ce, yet it never came to any thing : and if he made nothing of them\n(to benefit himfelf thereby) what hopes had we? Befides, we may judge of\nihefe Tables, and all this myftery of Letters, by what we have fcen in others\nof the fame kinde. Johannes Trithemius was a man that was fuppofed by mo11\nso have dealt with Spirits a long time^, and to have been inftrit\u20acted by them in\nfomi\u00a9\n\fIhe Treface.\norpc of thofe fecrccs that he pretends unto by his Books. \"\nI know f^me\nhave thought him innoccEt, or ct Icaft, have attempted to juilifie him;\nSome affed fuch things to (hew the'r wit, and think they (hall be thought\nmuch wif;r then other men, if they contradict received Opin ons, though\nther van'ty and ftrong conceit of their own parts, be rheAhief, i^ not\nonely ground.

The reading of Vigenaires\nbook of Cyphers (which I once thought a rare piccc; cs many other things of\nthe fame Author, which I had read) hath expreflfed thefe words from me in\nth:s place j and becaufe t hath fo much affinity with our prefeiit Theme, I\nwasthebolJer j But to return.

I know not what thefc\nmen can fay for themfelvcs, except it be, that they are refolvcd to make\nufe of the Liberty ofthe times to pleafe their humor j they may do it, but\nif that bring them to Heaven, they have good luck.\nBut the bufinefs of praying, is that I would principally in fift upon :\nYou fee here how Dr. Dee, where he gives an account of hinifelF to the\nEmperorj and others, bears himfelf much upon tW^, that fo many year*\nhe had been anearneft Suitor unto God by Frayer to obtain JFifdafi^fach\nwifdom^she wasambitiojs of. I believe him, that he had prayed very\nearncftly, and witK much importunity many times: This was the thini^j\nthat made him fo confident of his Spirits, that they mufl: needs be good\nSpirits and Angels. 1 know a man, I have no comfort to tell it, but that\nI would not conceal any thing that m.ay be a warning unto others, and yet\nI will have a refpev2: unto him too.- But I knew ohe,a very innocent man(in\nhis outward converfation, and as I believe very really) Humble, Religious,\nvery Learned and Orthodox, and one that had fuffered for his Confci-\nence, as others have done in thefe times: This worthy man, being en-\ngaged in a controverted Argument, upon which hisphancy had wrought\nvery much, or rather which had much vvrought upon his phancy ; he\nhad written much, filled much Paper, and was defirous to communicate\nunto me as his friend what he had done: But when I perceived that the\ndrift* of his writing was out of the Law and the Prophets, to (hew the ne-\ncefljty of fome things which I thought of a more indifferent nature i I\nwas not willing to meddle with it; and begun to argue againft his main\ndrift, and to (hew my difliking. After many words to and fro, he be-\ngan to prefs me with this, that he had often prayed with much earneltnefs,\nand he vyas very confident that God had heard his Prayers: Yea, he pro-\nceeded fo far, that if God were true, he could not be deceived, and ufcd\nmany other words to the fame purpofe, at which I was much amazed, but\ncouM\n\fl^he Preface,\ncoulddonogood upon him, fiich was his confidence and violence upon\nthisoccafion, though otherwife a very moderate ingenuous man: And\nthus I found him more then once, or twice. Truly, I think God was ve-\nry merciful unto him, that took him away in good time. But certainly this\nbufincfs of Frayer aiidpraifing^ is a bufincfs as of great comfort (the greateft\nthat mortal man is ca-pabJe of upon earth) fo of much more danger and\nd lufion , then many do believe. And if caution and circumfpedion be to\nbe ufccl in any thing that belongs to Religion, I think it ought in Prayer,\nas much as any thing. And fince I have adventured to tell one llory upoa\nmine own credit, I will t 11 one more upon better authority, which I have\nlong defired (for the obfcrvablenefs of it) to conmunicate unto the\nworld, and to tharend, had once inferred it in a Treatifeof nine, which\nI thought would have been Printed, but it was not : I will firll; give tha\nEnglifli of it, that all men may reap the benefit, and then fet it down in\nthe words of my Author (mmQ0\\^'n\u00a52it\\iQvIfdacCafauhcn^ of b.m^ as I\nhave it to fhew under his hand.\nAt a Co?ififtory in Geneva, upon a Friday, i8 July, J $ 89. the cafe of one\nMr. Nicholas hei??g there propofed to the Affemhly to be confidered of who was\nvpont to infiny^atc himfelf into pri'vateUoHJes^ jt?;der pretence of praying, and\nmadefnull congregations : Jhc bufincfs rvas dijliked by the Vaftors i ^irji, be-\ncaiife nothing in the Church of God ought to be done without order.

And where,w it was fiid at my laji appearing at this beholdery that\nI would appear again, and now it hath pleafed God to fend me to perform and make kjtown ac-\ncordingto that which wm then faid, that all things before promifed (hould be made plainly\nknown what Gods will is to be done in all that hath been before faid.\nNow I do mak\/ kjfown unto you the plain meaning and underjianding thereof.\nFirii th u haii been promifed the fecret kjiowledge and under^landing of the Fhilofophers Stone,\nof the Book of St. Dimftans, to have the kjtowledgeof them.\nIt is ftnte a long time, as thou kjiowefi to mans reafon, and to the mindc of man, a. few years\nis with man thought to be big , andnow God hath been thy kseper, and wo;r chiefiy created thee,\nand hath fuffcred thee to have time to live unto this age : and furthermore, thou doji lik^ vnto thy\nNativity, and confidering thy great age that the conrfe of Nature for age, if lik^'ly, by thy rea-\nfon, to takf place. BUT J >hn Dee, thou d H well remember unto whom,in the holy Scriptures,\nthatGodin his mercies did adde and put to fifteen years longer than the time was fet him : So\nthink^not but God in his 7verci-^s will be as great unto thee. And now to come to the matter where-\nby to let thee to utiderjiand why thou badd not thus thi^fe rare gifts and promifes performed unto\nthee, it was the will of God to hjep them away.., and to fuffer the heart of thy fupreme head and\ngovernour, '.nder God, to behardmd agaiajl thef, that thou art no better account made of unto\nhim, hut to he fuch an one that doth deal with Devils and by Soreery., as you commonly term them\nWitchcraft : and who dath, and who haih informed him, to be thus evil and hardly informed a~\ngain^ thee, but only the Devil, mid by the hatred of thy fecret enemy whom thou kjioweji (Salif-\nbury I mean\"^ and all m:ilicf and emmies that he can by hit Devils, Maferien, Hermcloe, the\nfour wicked ones,the which are uCCoun:ed the four Rulers of the Air,whofe names 6f OrieSjEgym,\nPaynini, and Mayrary : Ihey he the Devils that he dcth deal withall, that he through their en-\nticing and hifj he ihinkfth' to be pleafant and good wifdom that he receiveth at their hands ; That\nhe and his Devils do feek thy overthrow in all good things, and doth and (hall, fo far forth\nas God will fuffer the-!\", fe\\all the malice and hindrance in all good caufes to be done to thy\ngood. Therefore now John Dee I am to let thee to underft and plainly what Gods will and his\ngreat pirpofe if to have thee to do, although it may feem hard to thy good likjng, conftiering as\nthou doji think,i the weak^ejj^of thy body, and courfe of age .- yet notwithjlanding, that fame God\nthat hath benthyfrotecor and keeper until this prefent time of years, that fame merciful God\nJhall keep thee, and make thee able to perform thinn^s that pall be made kjtown unto thee ; for God\nwill not beliow fuch rare gifts as I have before faid, amongst thofe which be unworthy of fuch great\nblefffngs from the Almighty. For God will not bejlow Pearls amongH thofe that will not believe nor\nunderjiand that God hath any fuchhlefftngs to bejhw upon men : for I fay vnto thee, John Dee,\nthat if God ffjould or would befiow thofe blejJiMgsuponthee, even at this prefent, or at any time\nto be Ihortly performed and delivered unto thee : Then, except that thou fliouldH make\nall things plainly kjtown of Gods fee rets delivered unto thee, unto thy fupreme head under\nGod here upon earth,and likewife thy enemy to be partaker in thefefecrets andgreat gifts ofGod,if\nthou wouldU not perform as much unto them,as God (hould give wifdom unto thee,there?n,thy life\nwould and Jhould, by the envy and malice of thofe wicked ones,and by thy great enemy thou fhoiddff\njpeedily be cut off from this life, but God will net have it fo. So if thou wilt do as G\u00bbd (hall\ncommand thee by this meffage, thou fhalt have all thc(e.meffages, promifes and wifdom, both for\nt^r Fhilofophers Stone, the book of S.Dunftans,tie fecret wifdom of that Jewel that was de-\nlivered, as thou knowefi, in what maimer it is plainly kjtown unto thee.\nSo now it is the will of God to fuffer thy fupreme Head his heart to be hardned againft\nthee; and likfwife for thy great enemy for his wickfd injirudions againii thee,God doth fuffer it fo\nto be, even ,h Pharaoh his heart was hardned againii the children of God, fo jiandetk the mat-\nter againji thee with them. If is the will of God fo to fuffer it to their great account that they\n(hall have to makf, when it jhall pleafe the Almighty that that time (hall be, that they muHreiider\nunto God their accounts.

For^ John Dee, fuch hath Gods mercies been in fuffer-\ning wicked men to prevail againft thee, and they have and do make a fcom qf thee here\nin this thy Native Countrey : So it is with thee as it was with Chrifi and his Apofiles^ being\nmofi cruelly ufed in their own Native Ctuntreys ; fo John Dec, God hath fnffered thofe wic-\nh^ed men to pluck thee down in worldly affairs, the which jhould be maintenance for thee and\nfor thine^ and without fuch maintenance mancannot be without^ while he is here in this vale of\nMifery. Such wicked men have mofi cruelly ufed thee, even as Job by Gods fufferance, who\nfuffcred the Devil to prevail againfi him : yet Gods mercies be fo great unto theey that although\nthey Qmofi wickedly\") have robbed thee of thy poffeffion, yet God would not fufer thofe wicked\nones by any of their malicious praUices to prevail in any wife to hurt thy body, as Jobs wm :\nFor if they Qirough their wicked purpofes) could have wrought fuch cruelty againfi thee, thou\nbad^ not been a man living here upon earth until this time. So John Dee, thou dofi kfiow who\nk thy mortal enemy, who, rules next unto your earthly King.\nA.\nWhy thou maift well kpow, for I have made it kftown before time unto thee, that he is not thy\nfriend, though thou hafi not offended him in any wife, 'therefore, beeaufe that this thy Na-'\ntive Countrey is not a place fit for Gods purpofes in his wifdome to be beftowed upon thee\nhere, Therefore at my lafi Meffage, God did fend me to maks kifwn unto thee, whether he\nwould have thee to go, t;b<it t^ere tfco\u00ab mightft bc a man ; and that man, whom God hath\nappointed to make his Wifdome known : for thou art that man whom God hath cbofen, that\n(acctrding'y Jt it was p\/^ jifjtfr^rfj\nJ \"that itb\" mortal man in flefli, but onely \u00a3\u00aboc^, had\norfhall have the like wifdome made ifiown, plainly to be underftood by any man, or\nthou thy felf (halt underfiand and receive at the hands of the Almighty.

But God will bring the matter to light ; but\nEcclefton hath not dealt fc in the matter as Ik might have doHe,he it too to\/lack^in hit wn caufe.\nTherefore if the fault be in him, then do not blame the Creatures of God. For God could (as\nyou vcr}' well do know it) command that faid Treafure to be brought : but he will not\nhave it lo to be, becaufe it fliaU come by other means among men : So God hath a great care\nand purpofe to do all for your ;<^ood, to k\/ep matters out of blame and (lander of the world.\nOf it might come topaffe, if it jhould come by any other wayes, but by this plot whi'h it laid down\nto decline.
