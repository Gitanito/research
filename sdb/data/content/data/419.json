Thomas A. Cock, an Associate of the Society.\nThe list of the Corresponding Members of the Society having been\nread over, it was resolved that they all be re-elected for the coming year.\nThe consideration of the List of Honorary Associates was deferred\nuntil the next Meeting of Council.\nThe Report of the Finance Committee, including the scheme of\nexpenditure for the current year, was again under consideration, and\nwas adopted after a slight modification had been made.\nIt was agreed that the next General Meeting, on Saturday, the\n6th of March, be held at the Suffolk Street Rooms.\nThe next Meeting of the Council will be held on that day at 4.30 p.m.\nANNUAL BUSINESS MEETING.\nOwing to the absence of a quorum on the 29th ult., the Fourth\nAnnual Business Meeting of the Members of the Society stood\nadjourned, in accordance with Rule 15, to Friday, the 5th of February.\nThe chair was taken by Professor H. Sidgwick, at 4.30 p.m. He\nplaced before the Meeting the Audited Balance Sheet of the Receipts\nand Expenditure of the Society during the year H185, which appears 011\nthe next page. He also read a statement of the Assets and Liabilities\nof the Society at the end of last year. From this it appeared that these\nalmost exactly balanced, independent of the Library belonging to the\nSociety, and of the stock of Procucing8. An estimate had been made\naf the value of these two items. It was obvious, indeed, that property\nof that character might be estimated Tery differently according to the\npoint of view from which its value was regarded. But as the Society\nwas solvent independently, it might be considered in a sound and\nsatisfactory position.\nNo additional nominations for Members of Council having been\n\u00a3ent in, those whose names were included in the notices convening the\n\"Meeting were declared duly elected.\nANNOUNCEMENT OF GENERAL MEETING.\nThe next General Meeting of the Society will be held at the Rooms\nof the Society of British Artists, Suffolk Street, Pall Mall, S.W., on\nSatnnlay, March 6th, at 8.30 p.m., when a paper will be read by Pro-\nfessor Barrett, on Physical Phenomena connected with Spiritualism.\nf Digitized by (]t)VgIe\n\fSOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nRECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURE AOOOUNT FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31~t DECEMBER 1885.\no\n~\nN\"\nil\n~\n~r.\n1885.\nJan.

The words, he says, may\nconceivably be:-\n1. Consciously written in the ordinary way with the deliberate in-\ntention of expressing certain thoughts.\n2. Or they may be written automatically, that is, as I understan\nthe tenn, by the muscular action of the writer, but without previous\nconception of the thoughts which his hand is about to signify on paper,\nor even in total ignorance of the purport of what he is writing.\nMr. Myers then enumerates four sources from whence the influence\ndirecting the automatic action of the hand in a significant track, may\nconceivably be derived, viz.-\n1. Unconscious cerebration, that is, I suppose, spontaneous agita\ntiona of the brain of which the writer has no direct cognisance.\n2. Some higher unconscious intelligence or faculty of the mind, as\nin clairvoyance.\n3. Telepathic impact from other minds, that is, sympathy through\nother channels than the ordinary organs of sense with the thoughts or\naffections of other persons.\n4. Other spirits or extra human intelligences.\nIt is not my purpose to inquire into the value of these theories in\nexplaining the fact of automatic writing, or to consider how far the\nvarious principles, suggested as the source of the writing impulse, are\nentitled to claim the character of a wm MUltI. My object will be to\npoint out what seems to me a vital error in the way in which Mr. Myers\nsupposes planchette writing to be produced. Whatever the source from\nwhich the writing impulse is supposed to proceed, it is clearly under-\nstood by Mr. Myers to take effect through the muscular action of the\nplanchette writer, who blindly moves the board in such a manner as to\ntrace out significant lines,in the same way that the bird builds its nest,\nwithout previous conception of the structure it is rearing, or of the\npurpose which it is destined to serve. So in planchette writing the\nmovement of the board is supposed to be truly the act of the apparent\nwriters, although without intelligence of the sense their writing will be\nfound to express. But this is directly opposed to my own experience.\nI alwa.ys sit with a partner at planchette, with both our hands upon the\nboard, and have never seen writing obtained with a single sitter. Now\nI knoto that it is not I that am moving the board. I am conscious of\nDigitized by Google\n\f190 Journal qf Societ!l.for Psychical Researe\/I. [Feb.,1886.\nbeing entirely passive in the guidance of the pencil. To me it feels\nexactly as if the movement came from my partner.\nMy endeavour is to allow my hand passively to follow the movp-\nment of the board, and all that I do in the way of muscular action is to\ngive so much play to my hand, as may be needed in order to avoid\ninterfering with the feeble force by which the pencil is guided in the\nformation of letters. Whether that force proceeds from my partner or\nfrom some invisible power I have of course no direct knowledge. B~t\nmy partners give exactly the same account of their experience with that\nof which I am sensible in my own case. They assert tha.t they take no\na.ctive part in the guidance of the pencil. I have chiefly sat with a.\nlady in whose accurate observation as well as perfect good faith I have\nentire confidence. She writes me: \"I will try to describe about the\nplanchette writing, which in its best form is totally different from auto-\nmatic writing. I can speak positively as to this, as both a.re done\nthrough my mediumship. With the planchette there is no electric\nsensation in the arms and hands. They feel quite in their usual condi-\ntion. The fingers are placed on the board with sufficient firmness to\nexert a downwa.rd pressure on the pencil point, and after a little inter-\nval the board appears to become n living thing under one's hands,\nmoving often with great energy, and all that one has to do is to follow\nit, taking care that no involuntary movement on one's own part inter-\nferes with its proceedings, and that the hands remain in position upon\nit.\u00b7 The removal of a hand by either of the sitters breaks the link, and\nthe movement ceases instantly. This is equally the oo.se with the sub-\nordinate as with the chief medium. The writing is upside down to\nthe chief medium and \u00a3aces the subordinate. With C. I am subordinate\nmedium, with you, my father, husband, and aunt I am usually chief. I\nthink it is a proof that the movement is not caused automatically [i.e.,\nby the muscular act of the sitter] that the board has the power of\nlifting itself up under our hands, the pressure of which is downward.\nThe sense of separateness [i.e., independence of the sitter] in this writing\nis very great. I need not allude to the matter of what is written, for\nit would be too long a story to tell the numberless instances in which\ninformation has been given which could not have been derived from the\nminds of the sitters, and views expressed which were at variance with\nour own.\"\nTo the same efiect, in a case cited by Mr. Myers (p. 236) where the\nwriter was operating without a partner, and had, therefore, the whole\ncircumstances of the case within her immediate knowledge, she says:\n\"\\Vhen I write in this way the ideas do not come (consciously at least)\nfrom my mind, and my lw.ni seems to be gently moved by 801116 external\ninJluence.\"\nI have entire confidence in the assertion of my correspondent above\ngitized by (.oogI\n\f:Feb., 1886.] Journal qf &ciet!lfor P8gchical Re8earch. 191\nquoted that she is completely passive in the guidance of the pencil, and\nI have every corroboration of her word of which the case admits. I\nsee that her fingers are quite without rigidity, and the writing goes on\nunchecked while she looks away or converses with those around her.\nThe last time I had an opportunity of sitting with her (in August,\n1885) I said aloud on sitting down to the table that perhaps the real\noperators would give us some proof of the inter\\\"ention of a third\nintelligence besides our two selves. I had not in my own mind formed\nany precise idea of the proof I required, but I vaguely thought that\nperhaps they might refer to something unknown to either of us in a\nway that might subsequently be verified. The pencil began to move\nshortly after we sat down, but on looking at the writing we could\nneither of us guess what it was meant for. We replaced our hands on\nthe board, requesting the operators to write clearer. Tho writing\nimmediately recommenced, and now there was no difficulty in reading\nthe sentence, \" Vera runt ilia,\" which was obviously the same with\nwhat had been aimed at in the first imperfect attempt at writing. I\nunderstood it to mean that my supposition of the presence of a third\nintelligence who was the real mover of the pencil, was correct; and\nthis understanding was at once confirmed by planchette.\nNow I knew that the sentence was not written by me, nor had any\nsuch thought passed through my mind. My partner, therefore, could\nnot have been influenced to write by telepathic impact from my mind,\nand as she knew no Latin she could not have written it consciously\nherself. To me, therefore, it was as complete a proof as could possibly\nbe given of the operation of an intelligent agent distinct from either\nofus.\nH anyone thinks that an escape from my conclusion might be\nfound in the supposition that my unconscious self, approving, in Latin,\nmy own actual belief, telepathically influenced my:partner to write the\nwords, I would reply, in the first place, that such a supposition would\nbe in direct conflict with my partner's positive assertion as to a matter\nlying within her immediate cognisance, viz., the question whether the\nboard was guided by her active exertion or not. But independent of\nthis fundamental objection, I would call on the objector to establish, as\na vera cama, the power of my unconscious self telepathically to influence\nthe action of another person. The instance adduced by Mr. Myers of\na son brought home in the middle of a concert by the anxious longings\nof his mother, is not to the purpose, as in that case the affections tele-\npathically effective lay fully within the consciousness of the telepathic\nagent. It is incredii;)le that phases of that mysterious being, the uncon-\nscious self, which fail to inspire our own thoughts or actions, should\nyet have power to influence the bodily action of another person.\nThe exertion of mechanical force as if by an unseen agent has\nDigitized by Google\n\f192 Journal oj Socitf..'1 lor P8ychical BtWlrcl.. [Feb., l8Il6.\nfrequently been witnessed under various forms in other cases. The\nmovement of bodies in darkness or in light, apart from any human\nagency, bas been matter of daily experience at physiealsea.nOO8 for the\nlast forty years. And,in much closer analogy to the case of pla.nchette-\nwriting, a cloud of unexceptionable witnesses have given their testimony\nto the fact of what is known as psychography or slate-writing ; where\nwriting is produced under conditions carefully devised in order to\nexclude the possibility of its being done by human hands. Writing,\noften in languages unknown to anyone present, has been produced in\nnailed-up boxes, in the hollow between pairs of slates locked together\nor hermetically closed with gummed paper, or even between the pages\nof a closed book. Over and over again the word to be written hu\nbeen arbitrarily fixed by the sitters by naming the page and line of &\nbook taken down at random from the shelves at the moment, and only\nopened after the word has been written. Most of these I have\nrepeatedly witnessed in full light, under conditions that made the\npossibility of juggling inconceivable to me.\nIn the case of planchette-writing, the evidence of an external\nagency must, of counse, depend upon the credit given to the assertion of\nthe sitters that their handa are passive in the operation. Now, in my\nown case, I know that I can speak with perfect assurance to the ques-\ntion whether it is I who am guiding the pencil or not, and I naturally\n:..ttribute the same power to my partner. But if our assertion that the\nwriting is not done by either of our hands is believed, o.ll possible open-\ning for a telepathic explanation of the phenomenon is cut away. It will\nbe neeessary, then, in order to clesr the ground for such a theory, to\nmaintain that it is impossible for the sitter to say whether the board\nis moved by his own act or by an external force.\nHBNSLEIGH W BDGWOOD.\nMr. Wedgwood's very interesting paper raises two important points,\nfirst, as to the source of the motion of planchette, .and secondly, as to\nthe source of the communications given.\nAs to the first point, I must at once admit that I do not think that\nin the present state of our knowledge Mr. Wedgwood's argument can\nbe completely a.nswered. He argues that the motion of planchette\ncannot be always due to unconscious muscular action, because that\nmotion is sometimes considerable in amount, and proceeds while the\nwriter is carefully noting his own muscular sensations and the look of\nhis hands. and feels convinced that his muscles are not acting.\nNow, it is very hard to say to what extent one's musclesocan act\nunknown to us under these conditions. The\"willing-game\" shows us that\nthey can thus act to a small extent j that one may give a small push or\njerk, even whell one's whole att.ention is devoted to not jerking. But it\nDigitized by Google\n\fFeb., 1886.] Journal oj Society\/or P81JcMcal Ruearch. 193\nis quite possible that in these cases the jerk is the actual translation\ninto motion of the will twt to jerk,-an apparent paradox which will be\nbetter understood if we look upon all or most thoughts as involving\nrudimentary tendencies towards BOrne motion. In that case, if I resoh\u00b7e\nnot to move my hand, the very direction of attention to the hand-\nmoving centres may in effect move my hand ,lightly,-though at the\nlame time it will prevent my hand from moving mucl,.\nIt is therefore possible that we may very quickly reach the superior\nlimit above which unconscious motion (during definite attention)\ncannot go on. It is poSBible that Mr. Wedgwood's and his friend's\nconviction that they were not moving the planchette was justified by\nfact. On the other hand, we must remember that not only mesmerised\nsubjects, but some persons even in a waking state, when specially\nsusceptible to mggeBtion, can be made to believe that they are\nstruggling-say-to remove their hands from a table, while in reality\nthe muscles which would move their hands are at rest, and the muscles\nwhich keep their hands in position are tense,-in direct opposition to\ntheir own belief. Those who have performed such experiments as\nthese, (as I have myself done,) with a waking and perfectly conscious\nperson,-deluded on this point alone,-will hesitate before ascribing to\nextemal agency any effect which a man's own muscles are actually\ncapable of producing.\nOn the whole, it seems that in order to decide the matter either\nway, we need mechanical tests. Mr. Wedgwood's contention that the\nplanchette partly rose while the hands were pressing downwards is not,\nI think, cogent without such tests j for slight changes of pressure\nbetween the two bands may make the implement rise in almost any\ndirection.\nr would suggest to inquirers with a mechanical turn that they\nshould (1) repeat Faraday's experiment as to the rotatory motion given\nunconsciously to tables, and this both before and after warning the\nsitters to be careful not to push j and (2) try and get a planchette to\nwrite in a box or case, so contrived that the writers can apply\npressure only in one direction.\nI ought to add that Mr. and Mrs. Newnham, the chevaux de bataille\nof my theory-which is Mr. Newnham's theory, too-go even further\nthan Mr. Wedgwood, and state that the movement of planchette was\noften suell as Mrs. Newnham could not by conscious effort imitate\nafterwards under the like conditions.\nIi seems to me that this question (on which I took care not to\ndogmatise in the paper to which Mr. Wedgwood refers) must remain\nOpen until in the first place accurate meChanical tests have been\napplied, and in the second place some sort of agreement has been\nreached as to the occurrence or non-occurrence of other movements of\nDigitized by Google\n\f194 Journal oj Sodctg for P8.vc\/aical Re8carcll. [Feb., 1886.\nobjects by supernormal means, of which\" psychography,\" if it exists, is\nan example. I note with respect Mr. \\Vedgwood's conviction that\npsychography is a fact, for I know that he has not been sparing of time\nor trouble in satisfying himself on this point. But qualified opinions\non the matter are certainly not so accordant as tojustify us in assuming\npsychography as a foundation on which to base further argument.\nAnd so far as regards the source of the communications, it is not\nclear that e\\\"en were planchette to move without being touched at aU,\nthe words written need proceed from any mind except the minds of the\nsitters. )1any of those who believe in ~'physical movements\" t:xplain\nthem by an \" extl\"llrneural force\" exerted by certain persons in near\nproximity to their own bodies, though not by ordinary muscular action.\nThe sentence, \"Vera BUnt ilEa,\" which Mr. Wedgwood cites as a\nreply which could not ha.ve proceeded from the unconscious mind of a\nlady ignorant of Latin, is an unlucky one for this purpose. For it is\nplainly a fragment of the often-cited speech of the dNd Ficinus, \"0\nMichael, Michael, vera. sunt illa,\" as given by Baronius in a story\nwhich (though demonstrably inaccurate) has been repeated in a great\nmany collections. This is just the kind of phrase which would lodge\nin the mind even of a non-Latinist reader. I trust, however, that Mr.\nWedgwood's correspondent may be able to furnish some stronger cases\nof answers containing facts provably unknown to the persons present.\nI am disappointed at the sca.ntin,ess of the evidence sent to me for\nthese higher branches of automatic writing. I observe that the editor\nof Ligl,t has made a like appeal with equal ill-success, so that I am\nobliged to conclude that such phenomena are probably not now often\noccurring, that there are not many presentable cases of information\ngiven or identity proved. In reply to one of my papers on this subject,\nLight printed an article from an anonymous correspondent, who\nurged-as his sole instance to confute me-tha.t a friend of his had a.\nfriend whose children wrote messages in langua.ges which they did not\nknow. I at once asked for further particulars, but the anonymous\nwriter made no attempt to substantiate his statement. Now does any\neducated Spiritualist think me unfair because I am not impressed by\nletters of that kind1 Does he not agree with me in making small\naccount of anonymous dogmatism and third-hand gossip, whatever be the\ncause which they are meant to support 1 And, on the other hand, may\nI not call even upon my anti-Spiritualistic readers to receive with\nrespect a letter like Mr. Wedgwood's1 clear statement as it is of\npersonally-observed facts, which, whether we agree with his interpreta-\ntion of them or not, form, at any rate, one more brick in that fabric of\npsychical research which we and our successors shall yet be many a year\nin building.\nFREDERIC W.

I did not sufficiently signify\nin that paper my agreement with ~Iessrs. Myers and Gurney when they\nspeak of the dramatising faculty of the individual ima.gination. The\n\"materials of sense\" are always subjected to the\" categorising,\" mould-\ning, or robing faculty of the intelligence which receives them. But\nphilosophy has, in my view, not enough recognised that, while thought\nis universal, it is also individual, and hence receives a subjective tinge\nspecial to every individual mind. So that a thought, or sensation fronl\noutside (i.e., according to my idealism, from other minds) would receive\na more or less peculiar investiture from the individual into whom it\nenters. Ifall thought is universal, and yet also individual, my contention\nconcerning visions or abnormal percepts is surely justified afortiori i for\nthere is always something in the sense-element which irresistibly sug-\ngests an extema.l source. But to put the whole content of such percep-\ntion (normal or abnormal) into other minds is to put the origin of it\nback indefinitely, i.e., to give no origin at all. Hence this must be\nsupplemented by the additional admission of an investing, or dramatis-\ning power in the individual imagination. But what I maintain is\nthat, in dreams and visions, something is transferred; there is an\nelement from outside, something corresponding to what is usually\nmeant by objective.\nIf I dream of persons being in a situation in which they do not seem\nto themselves, or their friends to be, what corresponds externally to this\nmay be only a \"dominant suggestion \"--a vivid imagination by another\nintelligenc'll impressing itself on ours, and worked up by ours. But it\nmay also correspond to a passing thought of the person himself or to a.\nforgotten dream of his. In any case, the sensuous imagination is\nthe true creator of what we term objective reality-or the sensuous\nfantasy, working co-operatively-though there is a Diviner and more\nsubstantial kernel, or Basis of Intuition within, or behind this appea.r-\nance. So at least it seems. I would not be dogmatic !\nThe gist of my argument is that, if normal pel'ception implies an\nobjet,1; external to the individual perceiving mind, so does abnormal\nperception likewise.\nDigitized by Google\n\f196 Journal of Society\/or P8ychical Research.

The house-\n.a modern one, having been built, I believe, within the last half\ncentury-stands flush with the high road, having a garden on one side\nand at the back, and a barn, which separates it from a row of cotta~\non the other. On the ground floor, to the right and left of the entry\nrespectively, are II. drawing-room and dining-room; beh;nd each of these\nis a kitchen: the kitchen behind the dining-room communicates with\na small scullery, which leads into the barn above referred to. The barn,\nwhich has no window, possesses another door, opening to the high road.\nBeneath the house are dry and spacious cellars.\nThe first floor contains four rooms; situated as shown in the plan\nsubjoined. On the second floor there are three bedrooms, corresponding\nto the front rooms on the floor below; the rest of this floor is occupied\nby two windowless garrets, one of which contains the cistern.\nROUGH PLA.-'I1' OF FIllST FLOOR OF D-- LonoE, 'V--\nr: Mr.V.'a\nRoom occupied byDr. P., oratory Mra.

It W88\nneither lonely nor gloomy looking,\n1 WB8 not aware, upon taking po_ion of my apartments tltere, that\nany history attached to the house ; buth4ve aince learnt that an old gentle-\nman of no great reputation once lived there, who WB8 supposed to have had\nan illegitimate child, and to have made away with it. Tht:re were BOme\npeculiar stains on the floor of an upper room in the houae, and on the 0cca-\nsion of the kitchen chimney catching fire, what looked much like charred\nfragments of a child's bones came down. It is also said that the houae is\nbuilt upon the aite of an old inn (17th and 18th century) which was fre\u00b7\nquented by the outlawa of the Chiltem Hilla, and in which several murders\nwere committed.\nA Mra.

These noises, how-\never, were not very O88y to localise. They were at firat alight, but after-\nwards increaaed in intensity. They were eaaentially unearthly, an<l it is very\ndifficult to describe them. There were loud explosions, 80unda like the\nfalling of trays, atampinga, ruetlinga, aounds of heavy fumiture being\nmoved. When I sat in the room below, it seemed B8 if there were a lot of\nschoolboys\"larking\" in the bedroom above. There were &lao aighs and groans;\nbut no knockinga. Nor did I ever attempt to communicate with what I con-\nsidered to be an evil power. Strange to say, and thia WB8 noticed by previous\nand aubaequent occupants of the house, the noises se(:med to be greatest to-\nwards the full of the moon; and there were considerable intervals in which\nthey were not heard at all. The dog apparently heard nothing.\nOn the night of May 14th, 1874. I had retired to rest, quite ignorant that\n11 dear friend of mine WB8 dying.

He slept in the dressing-room, and burnt a light.\nBoth our doors were open, but I am aa certain as I can be that the lobby\n~oor waalaatened aa usual. Mr. W. knew nothing of these noises. In the\nmiddle of the night I was aroused by the most extraordinary clamour in the\nlobby j sprang out of bed and entered the dressing-room. AJJ I did 10 I 1&11'\nthedogwaa gone, and the lobby door wide open. Mr. W. waamuch agitaUldj\naid that he had been greatly alarmed, but should be better presently. It\nwas not till shortly before his death (December 28th, 1875) that he told me\nthat he had awoke just before I entered and seen the figure of a tall man, in\na grey woollen dressing-gown, standing at the foot of his bed. This\nappearance, I believe, coincides with what haa been seen by others. My\no()nly feeling at the moment waa that of great angerat being thus continually\ndisturbed, and upon this night especially, in a manner which was worse\nthan all that had gone before. Taking the light, I went out on the landing,\nwhere the noise still continued, followed it closely ~eT it _ed to go;\ndrove it, so to say, down stairs, seeming to hear the stampof feet upon each\natair, together with all indescribable lOund in the air, just where the head\n-of an invisible being, the height of a man, might Imve been. From tho\nalairs it proceeded, still stamping, into the dining-room, which I also\n~utered, with nerves braced for the worst that could befall, and thoroughly\ndetermined to cope with this noW' insupportable annoyance. In the middle\n1)f the room it Clued, and I adjured it in the Name of God. There was\nno answer, and in a moment or two, with more terror than I had ever felt\nbefore, I returned upstairs. Thedog waa atD.

Near this ottoman I used very\noften to hear noises.\nI may mention that before Mr. V~ took the house he had heard from\nme, at St. Augustine, what experiences I had there.

It was about 8 o'clock in the evening.

One night Mr. and Mrs. V. were either awake or awakened by a loud\ncruh in the centre of their bedroom, apparently, as if BOrne one had dropped\nlOme large coals on the floor.

Mr. V. hmml a similar agonised, indescribable, horror\u00b7stricken moan\none evening when he was going down stairs. The noile was impossible to\nlocalise and unearthly in its peculilU' tone and character.\ne. Sunday morning, September 14th, 1884, Mrs. V. was at home Bitting in\nthe dining.room alone ill the house. Mrs. P., who had succeeded Lizzie P.\u2022\nP\/'o fem., was in the garden with the baby. Mrs. V. heard a noise as ii\nsomeone were scrubbing the floor or grinding a coffee mill on the top floor.\nMrs. V. listened for some time ; the noise gre,,' louder and louder without\nbeing continuous. Mrs. V. called ill Mrs. P. to listen, and she heard tho)\nsame, IUld evell the baby heard it, and made his littlo remarks. No investi,\ngation was made as they felt too much alanned to go up. The door of the\nspare room opened and shut and banged of ita own accord, although all\nthe windows were shut. Mrs. V. watched the door and it stopped moving.\nShe stood nearly a quarter of an hour watching. As soon as she left off it\nopened again, and banged loudly, shaking the whole house. Doors on the\ntop floor have at various times done the same thing for no apparent reason.\nMr. V. has watched them also, but never caught them inflagmute delicto.\nf. In September, 1884, Mr. V. awoke one night. He was fully awake,\nand became vividly conooious of some evil presence close to him, apparently\nstriking with a sharp instrument 'against the bedstead close to his head,\nlllaking a ringing noise. He silently commanded the being three several\ntimes in the llI\\me of God to desist, and t.he noises ceased. Mr. V. said\nnothing to Mrs. V. about it, but he became aware that\u00b7she was in a Sta.td of\ngreat agitation, and asked her what was the matter. He found that abe\nhad been awake, and declared that some being 11ad paB8ed round the bed,\nand touched her foot on the way. She lay still and without speaking, and\nfelt some one holding his hanlls close to hc.r face. Mrs. V. also hoanl,\nshe afterwaMs said, this sharp knocking against the bed. Mr. V. lighted a\ncandle, but, as they expected, nothin~ was visible. Butthe strange sellB8tion\ndid not plUlB away for Borne little time. Mrs. V. was so disquieted that MI'. V.\npromised there and then to lea\\\"e the house. Next day he gave notice; his\nwife's health and nerves had begun to be seriously affected by what she had\nseen and heard, and before tlle month WaB over tlley had left the h(luso never\nto return.\nRemarks.- The above is a bare and uncoloured nan-ath'e of the phenomena\nwhich took place in the house during itsoccupation byAir. and Mrs.Y. Mr. V.,\nthe writer of the account, wishes to record his strong personal conviction\nthat the phenomena. admit of no llI\\tural explanation. Mr. Y. is of opinion\nthat the house is either under a curse or in some way under the influence of\ndiabolical agency, or of departed spirits wIll' have not found rest. Neitller\nMr. nor Mrs. V. !lor nny of their fellow sufferers, as far as they know, have\nenjoyed any experiences of the kind at any other time.\nUpon this evidence it was decided in the spring of 1885 to take\nthe house for six months. A member of the Society undertook to\ndefray the necessary expenditure. Tbe Society's time commenced on\nLady Day, and the house was occupied continually from the 30th\nM.areh till the 4th May by Major H. M. Hughes and three or four\nDigitized by Google\n\fFeb., 1886.] Jour1lal of Societ!J for PS!Jcllical Researcll; 205\nfriends. From the 7th to the 18th May it was occupied by the Misses\nPorter, and from that date until the end of September, 1885, when the\nsix months' tenure expired, it was occupied at intervals by various\nmembers of the Society, and others, for periods varying from one to\nfive days. The sum of these shorter periods was about 25 days, and\nabout 50 persons in all appear to have slept in the house during the\nsix months. Only two occurrences during that period appear to me to\ncall for any remark. In the middle of September a party of four\nladies and two gentlemen were staying in the house, and after they had\nretired to their rooms hurried steps were heard to descend the stairs.\nOn the gentlemen proceeding to investigate the matter it was dis-\ncovered that the door leading into the garden -which had been closed\nand bolted a short time before-was standing open. They inferred that\nsome one from the village had concealed himself in the house with the\nobject of playing the ghost.\nThe other incident referred to consisted in the occurrence of violent\nmanifestations during dark seances held in thA house by a party of\ngentlemen accompanied by the well-known medium, Mr. Eglinton, but\nthe details of these appaar to belong rather to the question of Mr.\nEglinton's mediumship than to that of the haunting of B-- Lodge.\nThe following letters from Mrs. Sidgwick and Professor Maca.1iBter\nmay be held to suggest a. possible means of accounting for the noises\nheard by Dr. P. and other witnesses; but the apparitions seen by Mr.\nW., Mrs. V. and others, if they were not simply hallucinations\ngenerated by expectancy or anxiety, seem to require some less obvious\nexplanation, and should, I think, be referred to the c1as& of phenomena\ntreated of by Mrs. H. Sidgwick in her paper on the\" Evidence for\nPhantasms of the Dead.\" (Proceeding\" Part VIII.)\nHill Side, Chesterton Road, Cambridge.\nJuly ~th., 1885.\nOur visit to w--- was quite uneventful. We encouraged the ghost\nas much as we could by sitting in the dark, &c., but to no purpose.\nThe house seema to me one well adapted for strange sounds, on account\nof its extreme nearne88 to tlle road. I think some one made this remark\nbefore, but I was certainly surprised to find how extremely audible outside\nsounds were, and tlle idea. that outside sounds have been lUistaken for inside\nones is rather supported by Dr. P.'d statement that the manifestations\noccurred more about full moon, because then people are out at night so mueb\nmore.

She also aaid that some\ndirt came down the \"';tchet~ chimney, but no bones tlmt she oould see. She\ncould not specify tlle year, but thought it was about 1875.\nThe stain on the boards in the top room I cut a small bit of, and brought\nit home; it is paint. Probably some paint pot had been standing on tlle board\nand stained it.\nTwo mell ill the neighbourhood (Mortimer and the landlord of tlle R..\"<i\nLion) told me tlmt tlle old inn was not. on tllat site but a little further down.\nThe local traditions of \"BOme murders\" resolve themselves into a story\nof one pedlar who was seen to enter tlle inn and was :not seen to leave it.\nThere was a later homicide in a house BOUth of the King and Queen Inn, but\nthat was the result of a quarrel, and tlle house is at BOme little distance.\nMrs. H. stated to me tllat she had only.teen tlle apparition once. Her\naccount of the old lady's vision differed from Dr. P.'s as to the character of\nthe apparition.\nWe made a. number of experiments on noises in the house, which creaks\nlike a basket on very alight :shaking. Mr. Hil~, of Downing College. who\nstayed tllere with us the laat night we were tllere, said tltat after we had\ngone upstairs, walking ratller heavily on purpose, the stairs creaked at\nintervals with 1\\ series of \"recoil creaks\" for a while. We also noticed this\nourselves.\nWhen I stamped or jumped in one of tho top rooms I set tlte whole\nhouse quivering, and tlle BOunds as heard below were quite disproportiona\\el1\nloud ; specially was this the case at midnight.\nOne of tlle nights waswindy, and when one of tlletop windows was left\nopen we had noises, with window fiapping, creaking, and doors slamming,\nquito enough to f~ighten a nervous man. When tlle door of the dark room\nat the top was left partly open and the window open, it produced a most eerie\nnoise when tlle wind blew.\nIt was altogether one of the noisiest houses I ever slept in, but every\nBOund we heard had an evident physical cause.\nI do not know whether Mrs. H.'s evidence has been taken down; it\nshould be, for tlle story of tlte lady visitor, as well as tltat of tlte first servant,\nrest on her evidence alolle, alao the story of tlte kitchen chimney.\nHer narratives were graphic<'l.lly told, especially the incident tlmt standing\nby tlle foot of her husband's bed one evening she heard the words, \"Three\nstages 1D0re and tlten death,\" tlle last word prolonged and hiased as through\nthe speaker's teetlt. Mrs. H. came up and showed me tlle placeswhere\nthese incidents took place. Her account of tlte appearance was a tall\nbald-headed lDan with side locks of long grey hair, clotlted in a long, grey\ndressing gown, and witlt bright blue eyes.

J. Y.\nPrevious to the year 1874: rumoura ofappearances were common,alwaYI at\none particular house (which your neighbour and my friend, Mr.--, has, with\nme, examined), and nowhere else in this town. In the year 1874 Mr. and\nHra. H. wllnt to live in the house. Mr. H. (\" a tall, thin gentleman\") was\nill a long time, and died 18 the hOUBO. After his neath, l\\lra. H., the widow,\n11111', as she says, \"the ghost,\" and her description of it is nearly enough a\ntrue description of hllr own departed hl1sband. She says the ghost breathed\nfaintly her name. Mra. H. BOOn after left the house, and is living now at\nW., Ji\\'e minutes' walk from my house. Whate\\'er construction may be put\n011 Mra. H.'s story, there CI\\n be no doubt whatever that Mra. H. is a clear-\nheaded, well-informed Christian lady, in whose veracity perfect reliance may\nbe placed. The house was next occupied by a curate, who frequently heard\nsomething but saw nothing. The house was then tenanted by a Mr. T. and\nfalDily for about 18 months, I believe, and they neither saw nor heard any-\nthing. Next aMra. G. occupied it. She\" frequently heard something but\nIIlW no appearance.\" Then the present curate, the Rev. Mr. V., and family\noccupied it. Mra. V. saw the ghost (as an old gentleman in long white robes)\nso many times that she durat not stop in the house any longer. She was\nable one night to wake up Mr. V. (who had not up to this time seen the\n\"ghoet\") before its disappearance, and he saw it. They got out of tho\nhouse as quickly B8 poaaible after this unpleasant experience in 18~. For\nseveral months last summer the house was occupied by deputations from the\nPaychological Society in London lucceaaively, each company numbering from\nfour to five persons. It is believed they neither saw nor heard anything\nparticular; but I am not quite lure that they have made public all their\nexperiences. . . . The house is a substantially-built brick building, and\nlooka like a comparatively modem structure, very remote from what we\nwowd expect as being a haunted house. There is a large, lofty wooden\nItructure adjoining the house on one side, which has not been made much\nuse of for years, and is in a somewhat dilapidated ltate. . . \u2022 This old\nwooden building, in luch close contiguity to the house, ii, to my mind, quite\nsufficient to account for anything that may have been heard.\nThen, as to what Mra. H. saw (or fancied sbe saw) after the long, weary\nwatching at the sick-ultimately death-bed of her husband, after his decease,\nWill it wonderful that she (in her weaknlll8, sorrow, and loneliness) shculd\nin the dark and lilent houra of the night meditate on the trial and scenes\nthrough which she had so recently passed, and so vividly realise the \"ery\npresence and foml of her delmrted husband 1 I have no belief whatever in\npoet Btories of this 80rt.\nIn conclusion I may add that we have bllen unable to ascertain\nthat there is the slightest ground for attacking the reputation of the old\ngentleman who \"once lived\" in the house before the Peeds; and think\nit not improbable that the stories against him have their foundation in\nthe supposed blood-stain, ascertained by Dr. Macalister to be paint.\nFRANK PODlI'ORL\nDigitized by Google\n\f208 Journal Qf Sl)ciet!l lor P8.'IcMcal Ile8eQ1\u00b7ch.

He had\nnot been absent more than 7 or 8 minutes when, as I was talking to my\nwife and sister, I was seized with a very urgent desire to go to him. (The\nconversation related to a visit which Wll proposed to l>ay that afternoon to 11\nneighbour, and no allusion was made to my father.) The feeling that I\nought to go and see him came upon me \"ith irresistible force. I insisted\nupon all in the house going out to find my father. I WIUI remonstrated with\n-my very great anxiety seeming so unreasonable. My father's afternoon\nstroll WIUI a regular habit of life in fine weather, and I had no reason to giv~\nwhy on that particular occasion I must insist on his being found. Search\nwas made, and it was my sad lot to find him dead in the field, in a place\nwhich, according to the route he ordinarily adopted, he would have reached\nabout 7 or 8 minutes after leaving the house.\nMy idea is that when he felt the stroke of death coming upon him he\nearnestly desired to see me, and that Ly the operation of certain psychical\nlaws that desire was communicated to me.\nE.

H. A. H., The Vicarage-\nDecember 19th, 1885.\nThe following occurrences took place 3 years ago, and had reference\nto parishioners here who were much on my mind, and whom I was visiting\nin their last illne88C8.\nOne was a farmer's wife who was much afraid of giving me trouble. I\nhad given her the Holy Communion during the .afternoon, and when I left\npromised to come again next day. She said she should be very glad to see\nme, but did not like to be such a trouble, as it was some distance and I W88\ngoing every day. I said it was no trouble, but the reason why I was here,\nand I should be sure to come.\nThat evening I had a miBBion service, 2 miles away, in qllite another\ndirection. Mrs. H. was witll me. We were walking home together,\nand had joked about not meeting anyone on tile road. I said, \"You see if\nyou had been alone you would actually have met no one to alarm you.\" It\nwas rather dark, but you could Bee a form 15 or 20 yards away. We walked\non, talking about various things, and then I saw someone coming. I asid,\n\"Here we meet someone at last.\" She said, \u2022\u2022 I don't see anyone.\"\n.. Tilere,\" I said; \"look, there comes an old woman, and she is twisting her\nshawl round her neck.\" My wife, however, could see nothing, but I thought\nto myself she will see her plainly enough directly. However, it melted\naway. There was no one. I said, \"It is very odd ; I certainly did see an\nold woman. Let us go into C.'s house (the village carpenter's) and Bee if\nthere is anyone dead.\" We went in, and he said, \"I have just got orders\nto make a coffin.\" I looked at Mrs. H. and said, \"Indeed, who is it for 1\"\nHe said, \"For Mrs. B.,\" naming the farmer's wife I had seen that very\nnfternoon. I said \"There must be some mistake. I only left her at\n4 o'clock, and there were no signs of immediate death.\" \"No,\" he said,\n\"it is so.\" I went next day, and found she had died from a sudden stoppnge\nof the heart, about half-past 8, and that almost her last words were, ,. I am\nsorry to give Mr. H. the trouble 'of coming again to-morrow.\"\nThe other occasion was about two or three months afterwards. A very\nrespectable young farmer broke a bloodve88el on the brain, and I visited\nm 80me tllree or four times. The last time he was quite unconscious, and\nDigitized by Google\n\fFeb., 181!6.] JOUMlnlof Sockty for P8yc\/,ical Re8earcl,\u2022 211\n\u2022\nevidently could not live long. He was very anxious to see me as much as\npoaaible before becoming wlconscious, often' aaying, \"Send for the vicar.\"\nOn the morning tlmt he died I was awoke by what I thought was Mrs.\nH. in her white dresaing-gown. We were sleeping, for some reason, in\nseparate rooms tlJAt night. I was very sleepy when awoke, and aaid, .. Is it\ntime to get up 1 I must have another 10 minutes,\" and fell asleep again. I\n... did not look at the face of the form, being very sleepy and feeling I1m~ it was.\nMrs. H. However, by-and-bye Mrs. H. elid come in, and aaid, \"Young\nR_ is dead; the girl who brings tile milk brought word.\" I said, \"Is\nit very long sinceyoufirlJt woke me1\" Theil she assured me it was the first time\nshe had been in the room. He had died about 5 that very morning, just aa\nI fancied I had been called by Mrs. H. My regret is, I did not look at tile\nface. but being tired and sleepy I only aaw the figure up to the waist, and\nwent oft\" to sleep with it standing there, never imagining it was not my wife.\nThat is my laat hallucipation. I have visited scores of death-beds since,\nbut have had no further visions.\nI may add I am in no way nervous, but a strong, middle-aged man, in\nexcellent health, and very temperate in eating as well as drinking. I don't\nquite know how to account for tIlese tllings, except tlJAt both tIlose people\nwere much in my mind, and botll of tIlem people for whom I had much\nreapect and sympatlly. H. A. H.\nMr. H. adds in subsequent letters :-\n1 may add, as regards tile first of the two curious visions, that I was very\nconstantly walking that road at that hour, as I had a weekly service ; but\nthat was the only occasion my eyes misled me. When I first saw the figure, it;\nappeared to be crosaing the road, but in our direction, like a person c1mnging\nfrom the footpath to tile middle of tile road. It was of course somewhat\nshadowy, as a person is in the dusk. Still, it had tile look of an old woman;\nI could distinguish tile BeL The road is a country one, but on nearing the\nriI1age tIlere are some lamp-posts; but we were some distance from them.\nIt was a cloudy and rather windy night, and there were, of course, shadows\nfrom clouds and trees cast about; it was not deep dark, but more tIlan dusk.\nI am 80 acc\\1stomed to tIlese walks tlJAt it would be difficult for any natural\nobject to have caused such an illusion. I was quite sure that an old woman\nwas tIlere, in the middle of tile road-ao sure tlJAt I did not keep my eye\nupon her, and as we came up she was gone. Mrs. H. has ordinary eye-sigbt,\nmuch like my own, neither remarkable for greatacutenesa of vision nor the\nre\"erae.\nI may add too, regarding the second case, tlmt I was fully awake,\nthough heavy with sleep, and did not dream Mrs. H. awoke me. I am\npersonally convinced of this, for I wondered, as 1 went off to sleElp again,\nthat Mrs. H. diel not go, and tIlought she would tell me in another minute\nor two that I really must get up.

Mr. H. said, \"It is curious we ha\"e never met\n.anyone.\" Not long afterwards, as we were nearing the village, he said,\n\u2022\u2022 Well, here comes some one at last; who is it?\" I said, \"I don't sce\n.anyone.\" He said, \"Oh you must, by the lamp-post; she is putting II\n:.shawl over hor head, and coming to Illeet us. Do you know her 1\" I B:lid, ~\n\" Certainly not, for there isn't anyono.\" He said, .. Anyhow she is coming\n<Juickly towards us ; then you muSt soe.\" In another minute we were both\n.sure it must have been some appearanco, and went into the carpenter's close\nby, to see if we could hear anything; and his first words were, \"\\Vell, sir,\nI have orders for a coffin for Mrs. B.\" We both said, \"Impossible! she\nseemed nicely this afternoon.\" I know she was anxious to spare my husband\nany trouble, as it was a long walk, and we naturally connected it\nwith this.\nAs regards the young farmer, he had been much on our minds, as it was\n.n distressing case in many ways. \\Vord was brought early in the morning\nthat he was dead; but owing to one of the children not being well, and\nhaving to be in my room, Mr. H. was in an adjoining one, and I would not\ndisturb him until later. When I went in I said, \" Well, poor J. R. is gone.\"\nHe said, .. I knew he would be; but why didn't you tell me when you came\nin before?\" I said, \u2022\u2022 I have not been in before.\" He said, \u2022\u2022Yea, when\n'you came in to wake me, and I begged for at all e\"ents 10 minutes more.\"\nHe then told me what he had said to me-as he thought, and he was sur-\nprised I did not all8wer.

I got up, fenring Mrs. \\Valler, ill the\n.adjoining room, was ill, but, as the calling of my name was 110 longer re-\npeated. I did 110t then disturb her. (There is no door of communication\nbetween the roums, thtl wall is 8olid, and a gigantic wardrobe is against it.)\nNext morning I I\\8ked her if she had called me during the night; but she\ndeclared she had slept\" like a top,\" and had never thought of me or anyone\nelse. I did llot mention the incident to her sister (who had just left us niter\na long visit), but she (Mrs. Waller) did, onretumillg to the country; and I\nenclose the result.\ngitized by (..oogI\n\fFeb., lsgG.] JOUl'llfllof Snciei!l\/or PS!lchicnl RfSM1'ck. 21~\nI enclose what Miss Young [a near relative who had been staying for 0.\nlong time with Mr. Russell and his wife] wrote to me, solely Crom her sister\u00b7\nmentioning to her my having questioned her.

Russell:-\nI will tell you something that has struck mo ratIleI'. The two nights my\nsister was with you in London were very disturbed nights to me ; you were\ncontinually in my dreams, and one of those nights I found myself sitting\nup in bed, having wuke myself up by calling you loudly by name. When\nshe came back she told me you had asked her one morning whether she had\ncalled you in tIle night, as you had distinctly hea.rd your name. I wish I\ncould remember which night it\"'was.

How this clever lady can herself\ndoubt the truth of many of the CNles she reports, is, I conCess, a marvel to\u00b7\nmy mind. Take the first case on p. 132, headed \"R- Nunnery.\" Three-\nof the witnesses, or rather two of them, saw the ,!!tune flfllll\u00b7C. Supposing\u00b7\nno c:>llt1sion between them, and there seelns to have been none, and pre-\nsuming their brains healthy, is it not far mm-e likely tllat there 1cas an\nobjective reality corresponding to their description of it, than that they\neould hM'e each experienced the same optical delusion 1 Even had the-\nappearan\"e been purely subjective, arising from diseased or overheated\nbrains, the odds are (I th01II1Cl1Ul to O1Ul against each brain conjuring\nup the IIClrne image!

Then, ill the case of \"B-- Fields,\" though in this callO\nthere was a whisper that the house was haunted, and the nature of the\napparition was also described, yet it seems to me a\/llJllrd to suppose that a.\nnumber of young people, presumably sound as to eye8 and brain, should be\nperpettlaUy seeing the same t:ill, black figure (1r.hic1~ lti(l pictlU'U frmn siyht\n-very strong proof here !) in various parts of the house!\"\" Even supposing\nthe possibility of the &arne optical delusion QCcurring to all the WItnesses,\n,.Of ~, I am excluding the hypothesis of tI.,~J:trll and falHhood.\nDigitized by Google\n\f214 Journal qf &ciet!lfor P3!1cllical Beaem\u00b7cl,.

Mr. Gibson seems to have seen the\n'phantom repeatedly 1cit\/wut alnrm, and the opening of the obstinate door is,\nto my mind, very strong evidence indeed of-lIupe,-h1tman ageney_ I use the\nword\" superhuman\" advisedly, as I think the word .. supernatural\" should\nhe erased from our dictionaries.

The reader will, I hope, pardon this digreuion; this word \"Iper-\n\u00b7\"(ltftroZ always makes me show my bristles somehow! I will now pass on to\nthe immediste subject in hand suggested by the heading of this paper.\nIt seems to me tllat there is a prima facit! probability of the frequent\ngenuineneu of apparitions_\nPaasing by tile Scriptural warrant for tlleir occurrence, as in the case of\nSanlUel's appearance to Saul, the Transfiguration, and the apparitions of ilie\nsaints after tho Crucifixion, which at least show tllat they ha\u00b7re appenml to\nman in his mouel\/ror \/lUlte, let us consider what the Soul-the Ego, really\nis. Wo l...,IQfV wo are Smd8 vestured with botliell. The Soul must be made of\n.wmetllin.g; infinitely rarified tllough its substance be, far lUore so than any\ngas known, the fact remains that tho soul must be made of IIOnl.etllill!!, or\nthere is no such thing as a Soul! Matter is molecular, as wo all know-the\nSoul is non-molecular, immaterial to our prellllut senses, probably maurial\nto Spirii-lIClIlIC, and composed of some other combination of atolUB than that\nwhich forms molecules. Hence the Soul is i1WitJisible, ultimate, and pre-\ncisely as spirit in a tumbler permeates the flr0llllC1- molecules of water, 80\ncould the infinitely finor particles composing the Soul easily pall throtu;A\nwalls, doors, &C. Since Soul mustoccupy the u-hole body, and notbeconfined to\n(}lIe lJa~rt of it, the irresistible inference is that the 80ul must be shaped lik\ntho body. Hore, then, we have arrived at the \"eal appal\"itioll, which is\nsimply the diMmbodied Soul, the real Being, the Ego. We have seen tMY\nDigitized by Google\n\fFeb., lS8ll.] Journal Qf Society for P,ychiMl Rl'&enrch. 215\nmaterial 81c1Mt411CU form no bar to its progreu when entering a room. And\nwe have the warrant of Scripture for the fact of the disembodied BOul being\nvisible to men in the flesl1, under certain conditioJl8. .\nHere then, it seems to me, we have the whole rationale of 10flll-authellti-\n.mud ghost stories. The reason lilly people pooh-pooh them 110 is, as is\nwell\u00b7known, limply through fear of being ridiculed. The belief in appari-\ntions is world-wide, and has existed for ages; of course there are numberlesa\nimpoaitioJl8 on record, and equally obviously an excited or diseased brain\ncan project images out of itself, which, though really purely subjective, seem\n~jtditle to the normal vision. But after making this large deduction from\nthe huge _ of ghost stories on record there still remain an immenBe\nnumber which cannot be explained away. Tho pouibility of ghoAts appear-\ning, once being admitted, the whole matter is merely a question of evi<lellce,\nand to be dealt with accordingly.\n.A very thin barrier may divide the seen and UJlBeen worlds.

DOVBTON.\nEaatboume.\nP.S.-The question of the appareZ of apparitions is, I confesa, a \",exata\n~uutw indeed. Mrs. Crowe attempts BOme explanation of it, but I can't\nlay my hand on the paaaage. Your readers may be able to suggest a way out\n<of the difficulty.\nI am glad to take this opportunity of explaining why the narratives of\nhaunted hOllseB Bpokenof byMr.Doveton appearto me somewhatlesa important\nthan most of those whicl1 I quoted in my paper on Phantasms of the Dead,pub-\nlished in Part VIII. of the Proceedings. R-- Nunnery, No. 16, is a. case\nabout which I hope we msy in time obtain more information, but at preBcnt I\n-do not put it in the first-clasa because the evidence for the iudependent\nappearance of the figure to a second person is at third hand only, aud cannot\ntherefore be regarded as being strong. In Mr. Gibson's narrative, G. 328, we\nhave also the testimony of one person only. It is, I think, a remarkable story\n<In account of the number of opportunities Mr. Gibson had of observing the\nfigure, and, as he BaYB, .. Ifit was a trick, I fail to see what it was done for.\"\n.still I cannot convince myself that it was absolutely impoaaible that it Rhould\nhave been a real man. The opening of the obstinate door was a very\n~urious incident, but there is nothing to connect it with the figure.\nI do not rank No. 163, B--Fields, among quite tho best stories of\nhaunted houaea, because it had been suggested to the percipients that it was\nhaunted by a black figure. There is some reason to suppose that BuggeBtion\nand expectation msy determine both the occurrence and the form of a\nlWluciJl8tion, and if this be BO we should be very cautious about regarding\nany other cause for an appearance as proved, when these are present.\nThe light in the cook's bedroom may poaaibly, I think, have been due\nto a candle. Mary Fo's experience resembleB a dream, and the\ndisturbance of Misa A. Co'a bedroom fumituro, like the opening of Mr.\nDigitized by Google\n\f216 JOIII'1wl qf Soc':ery for PS!If'hical Resl'f1rf'li.

And if I regard those given in the December\nand January Journal, as leas important than those on which I laid stress\nevidentially in my paper, it is merely\" question of degree. As I said in that\npaper, I do not think that they should be left out of account in estimating\nthe whole evidence.\nELEANOR MILDRED SIDGWICK.\nSUPPLEMENTARY LIBRARY CATALOGUE.\nThe foUawing additions ha t'e been m.ade since Uut mollth.\nFAHNESTOCK (Wm.
