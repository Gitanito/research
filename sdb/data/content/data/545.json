I esteem this to be a great work; and if, in a\nsense, it may be regarded as a preliminary discussion, it is not because\nthe materials are so meagre, but because the subject is so large. For\nmy own part, I oonceive that the evidence for spontaneous telepathy is\nextremely strong-that it forms, perhaps, the strongest class ofevidence\nthat our Society has yet dealt with. A praiseworthy attempt has been\nmade in these Tolumes to put part of this evidence into a numerical\nform, and to demonstrate the very great improbability of the reoorded\nooincidences being due to chance. In view of the fact, never before\nprecisely established, that purely subjective hallucinations of sane\npersons are by no means extraordinary or extremely rare occurrences,\nthis calculation was a necessary part of the argument. My belief is,\nhowever, that the strongest evidence is of such a nature that it cannot\neasily be clothed in numerical garments. Between a reoorded vision\nand the death, let us say, of a distant friend, there are other points of\nooincidence than that of time; frequently, for instance, there are curious\ncircumstantial similarities, such as have been described in these volumes,\nbut of which the evidential strength cannot well be expressed in\nnumbers, although we know that this must be very great.\nI may here be allowed, with reference to our Society and its\nprospects, shortly to review the present position of those departmenta\nof science with which we are most familiar, as well as the attitude\nassumed by the various scientific workers. First of all, we see the\nyouthful acolyte driven to science by the operation of an unoontrollable\ninstinct that selects for him not only the spot where he shall begin his\nmental labours, but the tools and the materials which he shall employ.\nHere he works indefatigably, adding with sure but cautious hand stone\nupon stone to his oomer of the great temple. of knowledge\" Casting\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f1887.] 263\nhis eyes around him, he sees fellow workers not far distant doing the\nsame thing, each equally busy in his own little corner.\nNow each of these workers may have only a very dim conception of\nthe shape and features which the completed building will ultimately\nassume. But yet there is no doubt in the mind of each that these\nvarious little works will so fit in with one another as to form one grand\nand harmonious whole. Were we to clothe this belief in Theistic\nlanguage it would imply,amid great darkness,a trust nevertheless in the\nunity of design of the Great Architect from whom each worker has\nreceived his commission. It would imply, moreover, a trust of each in\nhis fellow workers, a species of faith without which it would be impos-\nsible to rear any great and glorious temple, or indeed, for that matter,\nto do anything else worth mentioning in the world.\nWhat I have now described is the state of mind towards his\nfellows and towards his work of each individual in a group of builders\nengaged in some particular corner of the great work-field. We have\nseen that there is belief in his work and belief in his fellow-\nworkers. But there are many such groups, some of them very remote\nfrom others, and the feelings entertained by the members of one group\nfor those of a distant group are not always so satisfactory. It may\nbe that the microscopical'intentneBB with which the man of science\nhas to regard his near environment tends to disqualify him from\nproperly appreciating distant objects. Be this as it may, the members\nof one group are too apt to disregard the labours of another and\ndistant group, and to imagine either that they are not building\nat all or that they are not building anything that will\nlast. There is, in fine, a comparative inability to see that the\ndistant group are engaged equally with themselves in advancing\nthe same great work.\nIf I have made myself clear, it would seem that there is a strong\npractical faith amongst the neighbouring workmen in each department\nof science, and an equally strong aBSurance that their united labours\nwill ultimately have an issue larger than anyone of them can realise.\nThere is not, however, the same aBSuraDce that the various groups\nof workers are equally trustworthy, and that all are striving with\nearnestneBB and success to yield their contributions to the same great\ncause. Philosophy has, if I mistake not, her part to play amongst these\nworkers. I do not, I must confess, think that the union between\nphilosophy and science has hitherto, as a rule, been sufficiently intimate.\nPhilosophers have, as I think, too exclusively concerned themselves\nwith successfully deepening and enriching our conception of the\nuniverse as a whole, and hence have not taken sufficient pains to see\nthat scientifio workers have been duly permeated with the spirit and\ndoctrines of a true philosophy. One feels almost tempted to apply to\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fPr68ident'8 .Address. [April 23,\nsome of them the lines of the poet, who, after describing the huge works\nerected by the f&llen angela and the great projeds entertained by\nthem, proceeds thus to describe the philosophers of the party :-\nOthel'll apart sat on a hill retired,\nIn thought. more elevate, and reason'd high\nOf providence, foreknowledge, will, and fate,\nFix'd fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute,\nAnd found no end, in wandering maze. 10it.\nBut I would not have you suppose that I mean to make a sweeping\ncharge against all philosophers. There are some who have come down\nfrom those elevated regions on which they have obtained a clear insight\ninto the great temple of knowledge, to enforce their views upon the\nindividual scientific workers, amongst whom they have played the part\nof generals and directors of labour. Indeed, I believe that our Society\nowes its success in a great measure to this action of our first President,\nwho, while much distinguished as a philosopher, has not only success-\nfully enforced the claims of psychical research upon the regard of\nmen of science, but has likewise taken a person&! part in the scientific\nlabours of our Society.\nYou will perceive by these few remarks that while, as I think, there\nis not yet a complete unity of purpose or action between the scientific\nworkers in distant fields, yet the time is rapidly approaching when this\nunion will be more complete, and when (to use a technical term) the\ndiminution of intern&l friction will set so much more energy free\ntowards the completion of the one great and glorious work. To vary\nthe metaphor, we see before us at present a number of separate rivulets\nof knowledge each rushing along impetuously within well defined granite\nwalls. Let us, however, pursue the course of these rivulets sufficiently\nfar and we shall find that they will ultimately merge into one great and\nmighty river of knowledge, bearing on its bosom the means of inter-\ncommunion between distant regions, with fulness in all its borders.\nI anticipate, therefore, at no distant period the full recognition of our\nlabours by men of science in general; but here I pause to notice a\nfriendly objection that has been raised to the work of our Society.\nIt has been urged that we have not succeeded in formulating in\nprecise language laws which might embrace the various facts that we\nhave brought to light. This objection was raised before the publica-\ntion of Phantasms of the Li\",-ing j but I cannot think that it will be\nmaintained by anyone who has read this work. The shadowy form of\na. great reality is looming through the darkness, and at least two specu-\nlators are busy, each from his own point of view, endeavouring to render\nthe outlines clearer. Can we expect such 110 work to be definitely com-\npleted in a day or a year 7 It ought not to be forgotten that there are\nseveral possible explanatiolls of the facts recorded, and of these some\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f1887.] P'l'e8ident'8 .AddreB8. 265\nare less likely than others to yield us laws capable of definite expression,\nor at least of definite numerical expression. For what is the phenomenon\nbefore us7 Adopting the well-known, and not, I think, unscientific\nterms, mind, body, and medium, we find in these volumes that an affec-\ntion of the mind and body of A produces an affection of the mind and\nbody of B by some. unknown means, and often at a great distance.\nNow there are at least three conceivable hypotheses by which this\naction may be explained :-(1) The mind of A may act directly upon\nthe mind, and through it upon the body, of B ; or, (2) the mind of A may\nact directly upon the body, and through it upon the mind, of B; or, (3)\nthe body of A may act in a peculiar manner upon the medium, and the\nmedium may act upon the body, and through it upon the mind, of B.\nlf the last hypothesis be correct, we may confidently hope to obtain\nsomething approaching numerical laws ; but if the first hypothesis be\ntrue, it is more difficult to entertain this hope.\nAt present we should have three simultaneous objects in view. First\nof all, we must accumulate evidence; secondly, we must sift it; while\nin the third place we should discuss and speculate upon the confirmed\nevidence in the freest possible manner. I cannot doubt that the\ntruth will ultimately emerge from such a discussion, pursued with\nsufficient energy and perseverance.\nBefore concluding, I should wish to say a few words about another\nbranch of our programme of inquiry which has assumed considerable\nprominence in the Jou'f\"Tl,Q,l and Proceedings during the past year\n--I mean the phenomena of so-called Spiritualism. Those who are\nknown as Spiritualists maintain two things. They assert in the\nfirst place the existence of certain phenomena, while in the second place\nthey maintain that the simplest and most natural, if not, indeed, the\nonly legitimate explanation of these involves the existence of spirits\nwhich are permitted on certain occasions to hold intercourse with man\nI need not say that many of us believe in the existence of other\nintelligent beings besides man, unseen by us as a rule, and in all proba-\nbility superior to us in mental rank. Many, too, believe that the\ndenizens of the spiritual world are not indifferent to our welfare, and\nthat we frequently receive aid from them in important crises of our\nmortal life, while others are not unwilling to solicit such. aid. But\nprobably all are agreed that, assuming the existence of spirits, there is,\nat least, as great a variety of character amongst the inhabitants of the\nunseen world as amongst ourselves, if, indeed, the range of character\nbe not much greater, extending upwards to heights of goodness which\nwe cannot reach, and downwards to depths of guilt and ignominy\nwhich we cannot fathom. .\nMany will argue that under these circumstances we must so guard\nourselves in our intercOlirse with the spiritual world as to be certain\n.

And\nunquestionably a bad man who appeals to evil spirits to help him in\nhis wickedness deserves the reprobation of humanity, even although his\nadvances may not meet with any response. The attempts of the\nmodem Spiritualists to hold communion with the denizens of the\nunseen belong to neither of the categories now mentioned. They are\nnot the appeals of poor humanity for spiritual help from good angels,\nand unquestionably they are not the endeavours of the wicked to\nprocure &SSistance from the powerful and the bad. There is, as a rule,\nhardly any moral colouring about them; and the Spiritualists may be\nregarded as a society endeavouring to obtain conclusive proof of the\nexistence of spirits, rather than a confederacy to elicit spiritual aid in\nthe affairs of life. Now I have tried to show in these remarks that an\nindispensable condition of progress in any branchof science is mutual c0-\noperation and confidence between the various members of that branch.\nA man must trust his fellow-workers, otherwise he will not be able to\nadvance the department of knowledge to which he has devoted himself.\nAnd if our object be to receive scientific evidence of the existence of\nspirits, this &88umes co-operation between ourselves and these intel-\nligences. But here we have no guarantee for character such as we have\na right to demand from our fellow-workers in science. We know very\nwell that our comrades, in any ordinary branch of science or know-\nledge, are perfectly honest, and that their object is to advance that\nbranch. But assuming for the sake of argument that we can com-\nmunicate with spirits, what proof have we of their honesty, or how do\nwe know that their object, as well as ours, is to obtain for us good\nevidence of their existence 1 Some of us may be disposed to question\nthe likelihood of man being permitted in his present state to obtain at\nwill scientific evidence of the existence of spiritual beings. The spirits\nwith whom I &88ume, for the sake of argument, that we are brought into\ncontact, may neither have the power nor the will to prove their\nexistence as a scientific fact, and yet they may have the power of\nleaving the door of evidence partly open. We may in truth be dealing,\nnot so much with willing coadjutors that will &88ist us in throwing this\ndoor completely open, as with versatile opponents who will equally\noppose all attempts either to throw it completely open or to keep it\ndefinitely shut. In fine, we are not sure that this research will ever be\ndecisive or that we shall be able to prove either an affirmative or a\nnegative.\nIt is not necessary to discuss the question whether one who has\nsatisfied himself that he is in communion with spirits is acting wisely\nin continuing the intercourse. We have not, I imagine, as yet pro-\ngressed sufficiently far to entertain this question. The problem at\npresent before us is, to determine whether certain alleged ,phenomena\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f1887.] President'8 Address. 267\ndo or do not occur, and then, presuming, for the sake of argument,\nthat this question is decided in the affirmative, to give an opinion\nwhether it is not the simplest explanation of these to suppose them\ndue to spiritual agency. Unquestionably, certain members of our\nSociety are in a good position to afford help in settling these questions.\nfor they are skilled and well practised in examining evidence, and they\nare likewise capable of deciding whether telepathy or some extension of\nit may not account for the phenomena without the necessity of resorting\nto the hypothesis of spiritual agency j a.nd our friends the Spiritualists\nare, I think, perfectly justified in challenging us to undertake this\nbusiness of investigation. There are, however, reasons why the Com-\nmittee who undertake the task should rather be one requested by the\nPresident to act than 0. formal committee of our Society. Under these\ncircumstances I have requested the following gentlemen to take part,\nwith myself, in a Committee of this nature, with the view of investigating\nthe reality of such alleged Spiritualistic phenomena &8 may be brought\nbefore them :-Mr. W. Crookes, F.R.S., Professor O. J. Lodge, Professor\nBarrett, Mr. Angelo J. Lewis, Mr. E. Gurney, and Mr. F. W. H.\nMyers. These have all agreed to serve j and surely the composition of\nthe Committee is such that they may be trusted to examine in a receptive\nand impartial manner any evidence submitted to them, &8 well &8 to\ndetect any attempt at imposture that may be practised upon them.\nSuch attempts are greatly to be regretted j but we must perhaps expect\nthem to cling more closely to 0. subject of this nature than to the\nordinary branches of human knowledge.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f268 Peculiarities of aertain Post-Hypnotic States. [April 23,\nill.\nPECULIARITIES OF OERTAIN POST-HYPNOTIC STATES.\nBy EDMUND GURNBY.\nI.\nEXECUTION OF HyPNOTIC COMMANDS IN A WAKING AND IN A\nTRANCE-WAKING STATB.\nTo students of hypnotism it is one of the most familiar of truths that\na person on whom a command has been impressed during the\ntrance will often perform it afterwards, however out of place or\nridiculous it may be. The fact at once suggests two important\nquestions, one practical and the other psychological. (1) What limits,\nif any, can be assigned to the operator's influence in this respect f Could\nthe awakened .1 subject\" be made to do things completely alien to his\nnatural character---6.g., to commit a crime which would never have\nspontaneously occurred to him , (2) In what state is his mind during\nthe time that the command is being executed 1\nThis second question, it is plain, has practical bearings of its\nown; not only because on the state of the \"subject's\" mind will\ndepend the degree of his responsibility for his actions; but because\nby the state of his mind we must decide whether or not it is justifiable,\neven for experimental purposes, and with no risk of serious external\nconsequences, to suggest the performance of any action which is morally\nobjectionable. If his state is as remote from normality as that of\ndream, it might reasonably be held that acts performed in it left no\nmore trace on the character than those dream-scenes in which the most\nmagnanimous man is often mean, and the bravest man a coward; but\nin proportion as the state approximated in its general character to that\nof waking life, would the risk increase of mischievous results from an\nactua.l though artificial ascendency of lower impulses' I do not purpose\nto pursue this ethical question in the present paper: I have brought it\nforward merely for the sake of a word of caution, which seems at this\nmoment to be peculiarly needed. I seriously fear that the continuance,\nin the French schools, of experiments of the sham-criminal type may\ngreatly prejudice the general investigation of hypnotism. A certain\namountof not very reasonable prejudice has already been excited by\nthe proof that, with exceptionally sensitive\" subjects,\" a hypnotic\norder will produce the subsequent commission of a crime. That is to\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f1887.] PeC'Uliaritie8 of Oe'l'tain Post-H'!JP'1Wtic States. 269\nsay, hypnotism, like strychnine and arsenic, is an instrument that may\nbe abused; and people sometimes fail to see that this is not a reason\nfor neglecting to study it, any more than for exacting ignorance of the\nproperties of strychnine and arsenic from medical practitioners. But\na much more valid objection might be raised if the study itself were\nmisconducted; if the proof, already complete, degenerated into\nexhibition ; and if persons with no evil intent, merely by the\ninconsiderate repetition of sensational experiments,,- gave ground for\nsuspecting a possible perversion or weakening of their\" subject's\" moral.\nI believe myself that the danger of producing unconscious injury in\nthis way is very slight. The\" subject's\" frequent oblivion of his\naction is a strong guarantee that it has not left any appreciable trace\non his character ; and experimentation with healthy \"subjects\"-which\nI hope to see more and more made the specially English branch of the\ninvastigation-seems to show that they are not likely to act in opposition\nto their real character, except in cases when their real character is so\ncompletely off the stage as to run no chance of taint. But as it is\ncertain that the danger, when once it is rumoured abroad, will cause\nexaggerated alarm, and as it is one that can be perfectly easily avoided,\nI think the scientific rule should be to avoid it.\nTo pass now to the purely psychological question-it has generally\nbeen assumed that the mind of the\" subject,\" during the post-h'ypnotic\nperformance of a hypnotic command, is in its ordinary waking\nstate, and that the idea of performing the action presents itself\njust as scores of ideas whose immediate origin is not obvious\npresent themselves every day, and is carried out just as any spon-\ntaneous whim might be carried out. On this view the abnormality\nwould lie merely in the mode whereby the appropriate state of mind\n(including the idea and the impulse to carry it out) is evoked with\ncertainty at the mom~nt fore-ordained by the operator; not in the state\nof mind itself. Another view is that at the moment when the action\nis about to be performed, the hypnotic trance again supervenes, and\nlasts during its performance. And a third hypothesis has been that\nthe action is performed in a state distinct both from hypnotic trance\nand from nonnal waking, to which the name of \",Bille somnambulique\nhas been appropriated. Each of these views can claim facts in its\nsupport. But my conteBtion will be that each view in tum has\nbeen maintained in a far too sweeping \u00b7fashion ; that there has\nbeen here, as elsewhere in the hypnotic field, too much haste to\ngeneralise; and that the psychological condition ofthe\" subject\" during\nthe post-hypnotic performance of hypnotic commands, and also during\nthe intermediate period after waking and prior to the performance,\nreally admits of great variety. This will be clear, I hope, when we\nhave considered some actual cases.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f270 Peculiaritia of Oertain Post-Hypnotic States. [April 23,\nTo begin with, then, there are some caaes in which no reason what-\never appears for regarding the state in which the action is performed as\nother than normal. The\" subject's\" account of it afterwards is as of\nsomething which it just occurred to him that he would like to do, and\nwhich he did because he chose. While he does it, he is in his usual rela-\ntion to the external world, and can converse naturally and rationally;\nand both the performance itself and the surrounding circumstances are\ncompletely remembered afterwards. He is so much himself that, if the\nact is an odd one, he is conscious of its oddity, and will make excuses or\napologies for it. Thus, one of my recent\" subjects,\" who was told that\nat a certain time after waking he was to poke the fire-which would, of\ncourse, be an odd thing for him to do unasked in my room-when the\ntime arrived, turned to me and asked politely if I should object to his\npoking the fire. Another\" subject\" was told during his trance that,\nwhen I rose from my seat for the fourth time, he was to blow\nout a particular candle close to which my wife was sitting at work.\nHe was woke, and conversed with me in a perfectly natural manner.\nI rose from my seat at intervals, took a few paces through the room or\nstood at the fire for a few seconds, and sat down again. On the fourth\noccurrence of this, the lad got up, saying,\" There is too much light here\" ;\nbut instead of at once fulfilling the order, he had sufficient forethought\nand courtesy to take another candle from another table, and to place it\nwhere the one that he was to blowout stood ; after which he blew out\nthe right one. Questioned some minutes afterwards, he perfectly\nremembered what he had done. Similarly, Miss S., a \"subject\" of Mr.\nMyers, who had been told that she was to pluck off a large withered\nleaf from a plant in the drawing-room, on waking, went up to the\nplant, handled it, and asked her hostess's permission to pluck off the\nleaf, as she thought it would be au improvement. She had no sense at\nall of anything exceptional in her impulse.\nAs one might expect, caaes where this amount of recollectedness is\nmaintained shade into others where the reasonable instinct triumphs\nover the impulse. For example, Miss S. was told in the trance that\nshe was to change her dress for dinner, in a house where on ordinary\ndays this was not the custom. She and her hostess were sitting\ntogether in the drawing-room, the latter writing, when the dinner-\nhour approached. MiBB S. suggested that it was time to dress, and\nmeeting with no response, went up to her room. She afterwards\nreported that she had actually begun to take off her gown, but at the\nlast moment changed her mind. On another occasion, she was told to\nbring the spoons out of the dining-room into the drawing-room, which\nwas properly the parlour-maid's duty. She was left to wake in the\ndining-room, and presently followed the rest of the party into the\ndrawing-room, saying, \"I know what you want me t\".9..do, bllt I don't\nDigitized by l:.oogle\n\f1887.] Peculiarities of Certain Post-Hypnotic States. 271\nmean to do it-it is too absurd...\u2022 So here not only was the impulse\ntruly criticised. but its origin thence inferred.\nCases of this sort are chiefly interesting in their contrast to those\nwhere abnormalities appear-to which therefore we may at once pass.\nIt was in relation to memory that the first suggestion was found of\nsome peculiarity in the mental condition which accompanied the action.\nThere are cases where the action. though performed with every ap-\npearance of naturalness, and without any impairment of the normal\nconsciousness, proves to be completely forgotten within a few seconds\nof its performance. This happens even in cases where the action\nhas not been of a simple sort. which could be almost mechanically\ncarried out, but has. involved care and attention. For instance.\none of my \"subjects\" named P--ll (a sturdy young fellow of 22. a\nlight porter by trade.) had been told. in the trance. that he was after-\nwards to take up a pack of cards and pick out all the diamonds. He did\nso. talking rationally the while, but still in the tone of a person who\ndoes not want to be disturbed, and bestowing obvious pains on his task.\nWhen it was completed, he handed me the separate diamond suit, and\nreplaced the rest of the pack on the mantelpiece. In a few seconds he\nspontaneously took up the pack again. and went through it to make sure\nthat no diamonds remained; and then asked me for the diamonds and\nwent through them, to make sure that they were all there. Yet within\nhalf-a-minute he was unaware that there was a card in the room; when\nI told him to look for some. his eyes roamed about for some little time\nbefore they lit on the pack. which was lying in the same place as\nbefore; a.nd on examining it he expressed surprise at finding that all\nthe diamonds (which I had replaced at the top) were tOgether.\nBut the failure of subsequent memory is, after all. only an indirect\nsymptom of abnormality during the performance of the act. Moreover,\nit is not a constant sign: we shall have to notice later, on the one\nhand, that there is a condition of far more decided abnormality than\nwas involved in the instance just given, where yet memory of the\naction may survive intact; and, on the other hand, that memory some-\ntimes fails where the condition has shown no abnormality whatever.\nThus one is led at once to the idea of applying some test during the\nactual performance of the action. What test will be suitable 1 None,\nsurely, can be more so than the imposition of a new command. of a sort\nthat the \"subject\" would regard as ajoke and would never carry out. if\nhe received it when in a normal state. but which would be fulfilled as\na matter of course if impressed on him in a state of hypnotic sensibility.\nI will describe some experiments in which this test proved completely\nsatisfactory. The hypnotist in all the cases hereafter described was\nMr. G. A. Smith, to whom I am greatly indebted for his skilful and\npatient co-operation. I will call him S.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f2'12 PecUliarities of Oertain Post-Hypnotic State8. [April 23,\nOn February 26th, W--8 (a healthy and thriving young baker in\nBrighton, and an excellent hypnotic\" subject \") was told, when hypno-\ntised, that when next he came he was to take up some loose string and\nwind it up. As soon as he arrived, on February 28th, he took up some\nloose string which was lying in view, and began making it into a ball.\nThere were already some signs of abnormality, as, though USU&lly most\ncourteous in manner, he resented my interference with him with some\nrudeness. While he was busy with the string, S. came in and said to him :\n\"Before you go, you are to blowout one of the candles at the piano.\"\nW--s took no notice, but went on winding the string, and when he\nhad finished, handed it to S., saying, \"' You can have that.\" In a\nminute or two I asked him what he had been doing since he came in,\nHe replied, \"Only standing here, talking to you.\" Questioned about\nstring, he seemed completely puzzled, felt in his pockets, and declared\nthat he had not got any; nor did the actual sight and touch of the\nball which he had just wound up awaken any memory. Experiments\nof a different kind followed; and, just as he was leaving, he looked\nonce or twioe towards the piano, remarked, \"How that wax smells;\nI'll put it out,\" and then crossed the room and blew out one of the\ncandles, after which he turned to me and said, \"You don't mind,\ndo you, sid\"\nThe same experiment, tried with an intelligent young mechanic\nnamed S-t,who is in some ways a less impressionable\"subject,\"failed ;\nand it is interesting to observe that in his case there was no oblivion of\nthe action during the performance of which the fresh command was\ngiven; so that to a certain extent we may suppose that the failure of\nmemory and the responsiveness to commands vary together. S--t's\nstate of mind during the performance was, however, certainly not\nnonnaI. The order, given two days before, was to pull up a particular\nwindow-blind when next he came. On his arrival he showed restlessness\nand uneasiness, and in a minute jumped up, stripped off his coat, and\npulled up the blind--explaining, when I expostulated with him, that\nsomeone, he did not know who, had told him to do it, and offering\npolitely to pull it down again. But the command to blowout the\ncandle, which he received while pulling, remained unexecuted.\nA second way of testing the state in which the command is\nexecuted is by imposing, while the execution is in progress, not the\ncommand of a future action, but the suggestion of a future hallucm.\ntion. Here is a case in which something of this kind was done. On\nMarch 1st, W--8 was told that, as soon as he came next day, he was\nto take an umbrella from a corner of the room, open it, and walk\nabout the room with it. He arrives, and at once fulfils the order;\nand while he is examining the umbrella, S. tells him that when\nhe (S.) asks him after his wife, I shall disappE)&l\". lqunediately\nDigitized by ~008le\n\f1887.] Peculimities of Oertain Post-Hypnotic States. 273\nafter thi~ a change came over W--s's face, and he ceased fumbling\nwith the umbrella, and asked in surprise how he came by it. Some\nother experiments ensue; and then, while he is talking quite\nnaturally to me, S. says to him, \"How's your wife, Fred 1\" He\ninstantly looks up and around, asks where Mr. Gurney has gone to,\nand shows much astonishment. In this state he proves easily\nsusceptible to yet a further impression-a command, this time, to put\nhis hat on backwards before leaving, which he punctually fulfils. He at\nfirst doubts if the hat is his own, but then corrects its position, and\nexplains,\" It didn't seem quite to fit, but I had it on backwards.\"\nThe following case is still more interesting, as in it the two tests of\ncommand and hallucination were combined, and the hallucination was\nof a more positive sort. On ~Iarch 2nd, W--s is told, as on a previous\noccasion, to wind up some loose string when next he comes. While he\nis executing this command on March 3rd, S. tells him that he is to take\nthe glass shade off the centre ornament on the mantelpiece; and that\nwhen I cough for the fifth time, the room will become dark. As soon\nas the string was wound, he looked up suddenly, and asked how he\ncame by it. He then walked to the mantelpiece, removed the shade,\na.nd gave it to S. Being told to take it back, he absolutely denied\nhaving brought it-said he never would have dared to touch such a\nthing, for fear of breaking it; and he remembered no more about the\nstrtng than that he had fOUlld it in his hands. During the conversa-\ntion which followed, he was perfectly himself. I coughed at intervals,\nfive times, without any result. But either one of the coughs was not\nheard, or there was a mistake in counting, which never happened on\nany other occasion; for at my sixth cough he instantly began to\nbehave as if the room were in darkness, called for matches, fell against\nthe furniture, groped for the candles, and tried to light those which\nwere already lighted. The abnormal condition was in this case so\nadvanced that he had to be woke from it by a clap and call. I need\nnot say that no memory of it remained.\nYet another test was suggested by the fact that things heard in the\nhypnotic state, though forgotten on waking, are remembered when the\nhypnotic state again supervenes. If the \"subject,\" while post-\nhypnotically executing an order, showed remembrance of some quite\ndifferent topic which had been suggested to him while entranced, it\nwould be the strongest proof that the state of trance was to some extent\nrenewed. On March 22nd, P--ll was told in the trance that when\nI looked out of the window, he was to pick out the diamonds from a.\npack of cards; he was also told that there was going to be an exhibition\nof some performing fleas in a tent in the New Steine. He was roused,\nand at the appointed signal he took up the cards, and began sorting\nthem; and while so doing, he was questioned as to the fleas, and showed\nDigi T\n\f274 Pecu.liaritiu of Certain Post-Hypnotic States. [April 23,\ncomplete remembrance of that topic. The memory both of the cards\nand the fleas proved to survive, even after the fulfilment of the order;\nbut on his being hypnotised for a moment and then suddenly woke,\nboth ideas had completely vanished, and no reminders could recall\nthem. As on a former occasion, he had to look for the pack before he\nfound it, and was surprised that all the diamonds were together.\nBut the experiment was more interesting and conclusive when the\nidea which was thus revivable during the fulfilment of the command\nwas one that had been suggested on some quite different occasion, and\nso could not have been in any way associated with the command. Now\nin'previous experiments on the stages of hypnotic memory (see the\npaper on the subject later in this Number) a number of different ideas\nhad been impressed on the\" subjects,\" either in the lighter state of\ntrance, A, or in the deeper state, B. Of these ideas, three were as\nfollows-that the head of the Brighton pier had been washed away;\nthat a balloon had been seen floating over the King's.road; and that\ntwo large dogs had been having a fight in the Western-road. These,\nthen, supplied the test required. On February 28th W--s was told\nthat, when next he came, he was to play with an air-ball which was\nlying about in the room. Next day, while he is thus engaged, S. says\nto him, \"Fred, what was that about the pier 1\" He replies, \"What,\nabout its being partly washed away 1\"-which was one of the things\nthat he had been told in state A, on February 25th. S. then tells him\nthat, before he goes, he is to strike some notes on the piano ; and\nthat in four minutes he will see his wife in the room. Very\nsoon after this he puts doWB the ball, and talks quite natura.lly.\nHe is then questioned a.bout the pier, but says that he has not heard\n()f any accidents or of anything relating to the pier. He then begins to\nlook thoughtful, and soon says, \"Wasn't I to see someone here\nto-night, Mr. S. 1\" He could not explain, further than by saying\nthat he had an idea he was to see someone. I now began patting the\nair-ball about, and left it in his hands. He squeezed it with his\nthumbs, looked into it, and said, \"There is a face in it! Do you see\nthat face 1\" (The surface of the ball was shiny, but not enough so\nto reflect his own face, or anything in the room except the fire and\ncandles.) S. said, \"Whose face 1 Do you recognise it 1\" He replied,\n\"No; it's fading away now.\" It was impossible not to notice the\nchange which came over his own face as this hallucin&tion presented\nitself.1 He has very noticeable eyes, and the sort of filmy, dreamy\nexpression which is often seen during the process of hypnotisation, just\nbefore the eyes close, was on this occasion quite unmistakeable. It was\n1 Of. Delbamf, ..

He was then told that he\nwould see his wife in three minutes, and I took the ball from him;\nwhereupon he rubbed his eyes, looked himself again, and talked as\nusual. S. now went on to talk about the balloon; but it awakened no\nmemory in his mind, and he seemed to think we were poking fun at\nhim. Then the hazy look again appeared, and he said, \"I can see a\nlot of faces floating before my eyes to-night\"; but again he did\nnot recognise any of them, and said, \"They're going now.\" He rubbed\nhis eyes, and S. said, \"Can you\u00b7 see them now 1\" \" What f \" \" The\nfa.ces \"-upon which he gave a look of comical reproof, and said,\n\"You're trying to make something of me to-night-talking about\nfaces and balloons.\" I tossed him the air-ball again, and he began to\npat it up and down. And now a singular thing happened. He failed\nto remember the balloon over the King's-road, but he clearly re-\nmembered something about the dog-fight in the Western-road, which\nwas an idea connected with the deeper state B. It seems possible\nthat, owing to our persistence, the stage of trance which supervened\nthis time was really deeper than that of a few minutes before. It is in\nfavour of this view that, after rubbing his eyes, and rousing himself a\nlittle, he proved not to have arrived at normal wakefulness, but only at\nstage A; for as S. went on talking about the fight, he exclaimed, \"A\nballoon fight I \"-and when asked what he meant, said that S. had been\ntalking of a balloon over the King's-road. S. said, \"I was talking\nabout dogs\"; but he could not now be got to remember the dog\u00b7fight ;\nand when the balloon was mentioned a few seconds later, he had\nforgotten that too, and had come back to normality. The final incident\nof thislong experiment took place about half-an-hour later. W--s was\nin a hypnotic state, from which S. was just about to awake him, as it\nwas time for him to go-when he suddenly rose, walked to the piano,\nand stumblingly played a tune; thus fulfilling the order about striking\nsome notes, though in a manner which had not been contemplated.\nAs regards these experiments with W---8, I may mention that J did\nnot expect the suggestion of seeing his wife in the room to take effect;\nI was surprised, indeed, at its going so far as to produce even dimly the\nhallucination of faces. The production, at some future time, of so\ndefinite an hallucination as that of the visible presence of an absent\nperson is a very extreme result of hypnotic suggestion which-though\nI have come near itl_1 have never actually obtained with any of\nlOne evening, three of my \"subjects,\" when entranced, were impressed\nwith the idea that they were to see me euter their respective places of employ-\nment at an early hour next morning.

Recent French treatises, especially,\nhave abounded in long lists of states and sub-states, of which a good\nmany, at any rate, represent no general or radical distinctions, but\nmerely unimportant and quasi-accidental peculiarities. One writer\nmakes his classification largely depend on the detail whether the eyes\nare open or shut--though the eyes may remain shut during the liveliest\nsomnambulic convenation, and may remain open during rigid and\nspeechless trance. Another discovers and describes a peculiar state which\nhe calls \"fascination \" ; ignoring the fact that in a well-known work a\nstate which is practically the same has already been classified under\nthe head of \"charm,\" and that no real diBtinction has been shown\nbetween either and the leBS picturesquely named state of somnambulism\nwith open eyes. And so on. The fact is that it is impoBBible to\narrange the phenomena in tabular series, without ignoring a number\nof poBBible combinations, exceptions, and cross-divisions; and the fancy-\narrangement. of stages and transitions might easily come to rival in\nnumber and variety those of the German declensions, without leaving\na much clearer impreBSion on the student's mind. More especially\ndoes it need recognition that not only have hypnotic \"subjects\" their\nown little personal ways, bodily habit&, and mental characteristics; but\nthat every operator, and every hypnotic milieu, is likely to develop\nin a particular group of \" subjects\" habits which in other conditions are\nbeen to ~ee them there at any hour. Two of them told me afterwards that for\nsoDle time in the morning they had had an odd feeling that I was coming, and\nwere on the look\u00b7ont for me. The third had had no mch experience. On anotber\noccuion, I found tbat the impresllion whicb refused to develop itself in sensory\nform during waking moments would do so in Bleep. On March ht, W--s was\ntold, in the trance, that on that nigbt he would have a vivid dream, in wbich an\nunusual high tide would wash away the Parade, and would come up almost to\nhis Bhop. On l\\'larch 3rd, he Bpontaneously told DB that, on the night before\nlast, he had bad a very troubled dream, which woke him suddenly; but he\ncould not remember what it was about.

He\nwas then entranced, and tentatively qnestioned, when he said that he bad had a\ndream of a higb tide washing the Parade away, and coming up almost to his\nshop.

The real interest of these\ndifferences is in the wider general fact to which t.hey point--the delicate\nand far-reaching susceptibility of hypnotic .. subjects\" to unconscious\neducation. This is a theme on which J hope to say more on a future\noccasion; my immediate object is merely to keep the moral in view, and\nto inquire how far it applies to the present case. Is the state in which\nthe described fulfilment of hypnotically-impressed orders took place\nreally a distinct state, deserving of a separate name 1 The question has\nlately been raised in a somewhat aggressive way by the eminent\nBelgian professor, M. Delbaluf, and answered by him decidedly in the\nnegative.} My own answer-which can be supported by equally high\nauthority-would be as decidedly in the affirmative. On the one\nhand, no one probably will dispute that the various points above passed\nin review suffice very clearly to distinguish the condition from that of\nnormal waking; and, on the other hand, the extent to which the\n\"subject\" retains his natural relation to other people and to the\nexternal world, and the fact that his 1088 of memory is confined to the\nsingle point to which the command or suggestion related, are surely\npoints of sufficient importance to constitute a specific difference from\nthe ordinary state of hypnotic sleep. It is to Professor Beaunis, I\nbelieve, that the credit belongs of having first clearly recognised this\ndouble distinotion,2 and its importance for purposes of classification;\nthough I cannot hold that the name which he has applied to the state\ndistinguished-mile BOmnambulique-is a very happy one. For\n\"somnambulism\" surely suggests an absence of that very awakeness,\nthat natural relation to external conditions, which the performers in\nthese post-hypnotic cases are characterised by retaining. J am not\nprepared with a convenient French substitute; but in English I think\nthat trance-1JJfJ!ring might serve fairly well.\nI have referred to the view of M. Delbreuf-which he carries to the\nlength of considering that \"all the states represented as intermediate\nbetween waking and hypnotic sleep are simply hypnotic sleep, and\nnothing else.\" An observer of his calibre would, of course, not make\nBO\u00b7 forcible a. statement without having BOme grounds for it; and\nthese grounds consist in certain experiments made on his own domestics,\nwhich are of such peculiar interest that I make no apology for\nbriefly describing a few of them. I conclude from them that M. Delbreuf,\nBO far from showing that there is no true intermediate state of\ntrance-waking, has shown, if anything, that there are two instead of one;\n1 &we PhilO8Ophique for February, 1887.\n2 Bewe Philolophique for July, 1886.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f278 Peculiarities of Certain Post-Hypnotic States. [April 23.\nto which conclusion I would venture to add, as a rider, that in 80 new\nand complicated a branch of psychology, two maid-servants, of how-\never eminent a psychologist, hardly afford sufficient material for the\nformulation of quite sweeping general laws.\nThe following specimens will fairly illustrate the performances of\nthis remarkable pair of sisters. On March 13th, 1886, M. Delbmuf gave\nM--, for the first time, an order to execute after waking. The order\nwas to remove some dirty water, and then to return to the arm-chair\nand go to sleep. She executed the first part of the order, and when her\nmaster asked her what she had been doing, she told him. and said that\nshe had felt she ought to do it, as he had commanded her; but instead\nof returning to the arm-chair. she said. \"I have woke up, sir.\" Asked\nwhen she woke. she said, \"When 1 emptied the pail.\" \"You were\nasleep before that, then 1\" \"I don't know.\" \"Then why do you say\nthat you woke at that moment 1\" \"Because at that moment I felt\nthat I was doing something unusual.\"\nOn March 21st, a friend of M. Delbmufs told J--, who was\nhypnotised. that when she brought in the second course at\nsupper, she was to throw the contents of the dish over one\nof the guests, M. MasiuB. M. Delbmuf interfered, and told\nher to kiss his wife instead, as less inconvenient. To this\nshe agreed. When supper began, he repeated his caution, and she\nagain reassured him. On entering with the second course, J-- went\nup to her mistress, asked leave to kiss her, and did so. and then held\nthe dish for her to help herself. She then stood undecided. There was\nnot a moment to lose, and M. Delbmuf dart-ed towards her, saying.\n\" Give me the dish.\" She resisted. and he had to take it by force, and\nhanded it to M--. He then blew in J--'s face,-when she shook\nherself, and seemed to wake; but as she still had retained a look of\ndetermination, and attempted to take the dish from her sister's hands.\nshe was prudently kept apart for the remainder of the course. Next\nday J-- remembered that she had not been able to help kissing her\nmistress, and that she had had an impulse to drop the dish, not on the\ndoor, but over M. Masius or between him and Madame Delbmuf;\nbut she was not sure whether she would actually have done so.\nOn April 1st, J-- was told that, when a particular guest put his\nglass to his lips, she would see his hair suddenly grow to an inordinate\nlength, and that she would fetch a comb and comb it till it resumed ita\nformer length; and then she was to wake. The first part of the order\nwas carried out precisely. and she answered a number of questions\ncorrectly while the combing was going on; but then, instead of at\nonce waking, she settled herself in the arm-chair and slept for some\nminutes, after which she woke spontaneously. and the sight of the comb\nbrought back the whole scene. She described the details of the\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f1887.] Peculiaritie8 of Oertain Post-Hypnotic States. 279\nhallucination and of her own proceedings, and remembered the \u2022\nquestions that she haQ answered, and the act of waking. The only\npoint which she did not recall was returning to the arm-chair and\nfalling asleeep; and this lacuna in her memory puzzled her. But as\nM. Delbreuf justly remarks, unconsciousness of the moment of\nbecoming unconscious is a species of forgetfulness with which we\nare all familiar.\nThe next case is more elaborate. On April 2nd M. Delbreuf said\nto M--, who had been entranced while she was knitting, \"After I\nwake you, you will knit for five minutes, and then you will write to\nyour father. You will tell him that you are happy at Liege, and that\norder is re-established there. And you will tell me what you have done.\"\nM-- is woke, and takes up her work; after eight minutes, her eyes\nclose. M. Dplbreuf waited five minutes and then woke her. She was\nsurprised to find that she had been asleep, and disowned any desire to\ndo anything particular. M. Delbmuf re-hypnotised her, and asked her\nwhat it was that she had been told to do. \" 1 ~o not recollect.\" \" 1\ntold you to write to your father.\" \"It is done.\" \"What do you mean~\nWhat have you written to him 1\" \" That 1 was happy at Liege,\" &c.\n\"You have not written anything; you have been dreaming. Now you\nare to write to him, in three minutes.\" She is woke, and resumes her\nknitting. In six minutes, she rises with an air of resolution, and says,\n\"I have got to write.\" \"Sit down at the table; there are the materials.\"\n\" No, 1 shall go downstairs.\" \" Why' \" \"I don't want to write here ;\nI want to write in the kitchen.\" She goes downstairs, and demands\nwriting materials in a peremptory tone which surprises her fellow-\nservants. M. Delbreuf follows her, and she asks him whether she is\nnot entranced, and receives an evasive answer. She is supplied, not\nwith note-paper, but with a piece of an old bill, and shows no surprise\nat this, but will not write while her master is present; he therefore\ntells her to come u}HItairs and show him her letter, when it is finished.\nAfter a time she appears without the letter, and begins to knit; and\non being questioned, she says that she has hidden the letter, because\nher sister wanted to take it from her. M. Delbmuf goes on talking to\nher, but she appears discontented and gives short answers. \" Are you\nasleep, M--1\" he asks. \" 1 don't think so, sir,\" she replies. He\nblows in her face, and she comes to herself with a start, and smiles. She\nthen describes every detail of what had passed. On getting possession\nof the hidden letter, M. Delbreuf finds that it runs, \"My dear father, 1\nhasten to inform you that everything is quiet at Liege, and that we are\ngetting on very happily.\"\nM. Delbreuf draws attention to the two chief points of interest in\nthis case; the independence and initiative which the\"subject\" showed in\nthe details of her conduct, while still never transgressing the \\itles of the\nDigitized by ~oo8le\n\f280 Peculiarities of Certain P08t-Hypnotic States. [April 23,\norder; and the first fulfilment of the orner in a dream, which may be re-\ngarded as closely analogous to its real fulfilment in the state of trance-\nwaking. Another more striking instance of this novel sort of dream-ful-\nfilment was given on a later occasion when an orner was given the actual\nfulfilment of which would have involved violent outrage to a long-\nestablished habit. M. Delbreuf told her to straighten a crooked\nknitting-needle at a future moment when he foresaw that to do 80\nwould necessitate drawing the needle out of the stocking, and spoiling\nthe work. When the moment arrived, she solved the difficulty by going\nto sleep, and dreaming that she straightened the needle; and on\nwaking she was only with difficulty convinced that her fulfilment of\nthe order had been imaginary.\nAnother noticeable point which occurred in BOme cases was the\nlimitation of the \"subject's\" consciousness to the one idea suggested.\nM-- was told that in a quarter of an hour she was to go and console\na statuette of a weeping monk on the mantel-piece, and was then woke.\nShe rose at the appointed time, with the customary change of\nphysiognomy, and executed the orner in dramatic fashion; and when\nafterwards asked what she experienced she said, \"I was not here, I\nwas transported somewhere else; I saw no one, I was all alone.\" So\nafter being told to take off her garter and put it round her mistress's\nneck-an order the literal fulfilment of which was accidentally pre-\nvented-she said, when asked, that she should have carried it out, even\nin M. Delbreufs presence, as she\" saw no one but Madame.\"\nFurther experiments showed that the\" subjects\" could afterwards\ndescribe ridiculous scenes which they enacted, in the midst of normal\nlife, in obedience to previous hypnotic commands-a.s where M-- was\na petroleum lamp, and struck a match to light herself; where M-- was\na pig, which J-- was selling to a customer; where M-- was a wheel-\nbarrow full of potatoes,which J--was wheeling about; and where each\nwhich she afterwards recovered. The interest of these observations, for\nill tum was taken to a mirror, and persuaded that she had lost her head,\nM. Delbreuf, is that the sort of credulity involved-the conscious but\nat the same time wholly uncritical acceptance of these absurn r6lu-\nwas entirely similar to what was displayed by the same \"subjects\" in\nrespect of delusions that took effect in their ordinary hypnotic\ncondition.\nThe first point to notice in these results of M. Delbreufs is their\nvery exceptional character as regarns memory. They show that even\nProfessor Beaunis-one of the most careful as well as one of the ablest\nof the authorities-has gone too far in making subsequent oblivion the\ncrucial test of his wille 8omnambulique. I know of no cases where the\nmemory of the post-hypnotic performances has proved so clear, while\nat the same time the state in which they took place}US so Iobviously\nDigitized by ~008 e\n\f1887.] Peculiarities of Certain Post-Hyp7Wtic States. 281\nabnormal. But a no less exceptional point was that these\" subjects \"\nequally remembered what took place during a state of trance induced\nby ordinary means-that is to say, during the deepest hypnotic state\nto which it was possible to bring them. And furthennore, M. Delbaluf\ntells us that, when entranced, they were always in rapport with every\none alike; thus we have seen that the command as to spilling the\ncontents of the dish was suddenly given to one of them by a stranger.\nNow, to begin with, I must maintain that the combined features of\nbreach of memory and special rapport with the hypnotiser are such\ncommon and such important characteristics of hypnotic trance, that\ncases which present them and cases which do not had better not be\nconfounded under a single general name. M. Delbreuf seems to have\nsome consciousness of this objection; for he tries to get round it, as\nregards memory at any rate, by treating the question as merely one of\neducation. But in the first place this is certainly far less so than he\nSUpposes;l and in the second place, the fact that an abnormality\ncan be removed by particular ~reatment does not make it insignificant.\nTo avoid a new term, M. Delbaluf might still think it enough to\nsay that his \"subjects,\" alike when hypnotised by ordinary means\nand when subsequently carrying out hypnotic commands, were\nin a lighter 8~e of trance than mine. I prefer the term trance-'llJ(J,king\n1 We have seen, for instance, that M-- perfectly remembered the first\npost-hypnotic fulfilment that she was ever engaged in. In an interesting\nseries of experiments (Revue Pkilosopkiqtu for May, 1886), M. Delbreuf found\nthat if he woke his II subjects\" while they were actually occupied in\nfollowing out some hypnotic command or hallucination, they recalled what\nhad passed, as a dream; and here again he at once 8S8umes that he\nhas established a nniversallaw. I have frequently seen English II subjects ..\nwoke in the same way, in the midst of a performance or a hallucination,\nand I have never found memory to survive, except in the case of simple\nimitative actions where no delnsion W80il involveJ, and very dimly in the case\nof new\" subjects \"-that is to say, exactly those who had not had hypnotic\neducation. On the very day that I first read M. Delbreufs accnunt, I exactly\nrepeated on two .. subjects\" an experiment of his in which the ballucination\ncommunicated was ot something catching fire, and having to be extinguished by\nbeing plunged into (real) water. The II subjects\" were suddenl, woke with the\ndripping article in their hands; but neither of them had the slightest memory\nhow it came there, nor of the previous train of ideas. I offered each of them a\nsovereign to recall his .. dream \"; but it had left not a wrack behind.\nMoreover, in many of the cases which M. Delbmuf describes, he had given tke\nC01nmana that the things done or experienced were to be afterwards\nremembered and described. No one familiar with hypnotism would be\nsurprised that tki. means should prove effective; and it would be interesting to\nknow whether such a command was given in the other cases where it is not\nexpressly mentionetl. I may add that M. Delbmuf seems to press the resem\u00b7\nblance of even the remembered hypnotic hallucinations to ordinary dreams much\ntoo far; for he prac'ically treats the latter as if they were never remembered\nin waking hours unl_ lOme Bpecial sensation or experiellce recalled ~m'oole\nDigitized by ~U \"\n\f282 Peculiarities of Certain P08t-HYfYMtic State& [April 23,\nfor this lighter state, simply because it emphaaisea the fact that the\ndeeper state, into which his \"subjects\" were apparently incapable of\nbeing brought, is alBO the ordinary, or, aa we may say, the normal\none, in ca.aea where any decided hypnotic peculiarities appear.\nBut the further point which I want more especially to bring out ia\nthis-that even his\" subjects\" exhibited varieties of state during their\nperformances of commands. Sometimes they spontaneously resumed\nnormal life at the conclusion of the performance; but even these C&SeB\nwere not quite parallel to moat of mine; aa these girla' consciousness of\na change--()f \"waking,\" aa they described it-haa never been described\nby my \"subjects,\" though with them the frequent breach of memory\nmight have been expected specially to favour it.

Further, there are the occa.aiona on\nwhich they wholly lost rapport with the external world--a very marlr\"d\nfeature, and conspicuously absent in my \"subjects.\" In a word, apart\nfrom the memory-teat (which M. Delbreuf himself regards aa inconclu-\nsive), the Belgian\" subjects\" were not in a lighter but in a deeper, a\nmore abnormal, state than the English ones. So decidedly waa this the\nca.ae that, even if M. Delbreuf refusea to recognise his own variety of the\ntJeille .omnambuliqu6, I do not see how, on the symptoms, he could\nrefuse to recognise mine. It seems, in fact, to be separated by an even\nwider gap from the complete trance on the one hand than, on the other,\nfrom the performances carried out without any apparent deviation from\nnormality (p. 270)-a cla.aa, by the way, of which M. De1breuf seems to\nbe equally unaware.\nII.\nAUTOMATIC EXECUTION OF SLIGHT PHYSICAL MOVEIIlBNTS.\nWe have now considered three clA88811 of ca.aea ;-(1) those where\nthe ordained action is consciously performed in a normal state, and\nremembered; (2) those where it is consciously performed in a trance-\nwaking state, and forgotten; and (3) those where it is consciously\n1 See p. 273 ; and compare the C8II8 which M.

It naturally\noccurs to one to ask if the list can be extended-if there is any\nfourth class of cases when the action is performed in a 'lUJ'l\"lnal\nstate, and forgotten. For, on reflection, it is evident that the\nmere fact of an action being at once or almost at once forgotten\nis no sufficient proof of its having been performed in an abnormal\nstate. There is nothing unusual in the immediate oblivion of things\nwhich have been done in a perfectly normal waking condition. A\nlarge number of actions-those which we commonly call automatic-\nare performed in such a condition; many of these are performed with-\nout consciousness, and afortiori many of them leave no trace in the\nmemory. It would not, therefore, be at all surprising to find that\ncertain actions induced by previous hypnotic suggestion were of this\nkind-truly automatic, and involving no more consciousness or memory\nthan things which we often do with our bands while our minds are\nengrossed in thought or conversation. Nor would it be surprising if\nthe scope of such unconscious and unremembered actions proved to be\nrather larger when they are the result of previous hypnotic suggestion,\nthan when they are the result of habit. It may be said, I think, of\nmany of our simpler and habitual actions, that we attend to\nthem much more than is necessary for the performing of them;\nand the fact of their remaining to BOme extent in our\nmemory is usually due to one of two things. Either the\nobject for which we performed them had some interest and\nimportance for us, and the actions that we went through to attain this\nobject are remembered through their 8oBsociation with it; thus we\nremember opening an envelope five minutes after doing so, because we\nhad BOme interest in getting at the letter inside, and the greater\nmemory draws, 80B it were, the lesser one into its wake. Or else quite\nunimportant details of custom engage our attention, and BO are after-\nwards remembered, merely because the attention is not BOlicited in any\nother direction; thus in the course of an ordinary day we may remem-\nber the process of dressing in the morning, though we quite forget it\non BOme exceptional day when we had to go through it after a sudden\nawaking, and while listening to BOme agitating news. Now in the\npostrhypnotic execution of commands, both these conditions of atten-\ntion and memory are often absent. The act is performed without any\nI It should be remarked that-apart from the exceptional cases laa~\ndescribed where there is an approximation to complete trance-the third class\nreally shades into the first ; since normality is not separated from trance\u00b7\nwaking by any definable line. Subseqnent memory seems to be the rule in\nC888II where abnormality haa only reached the point that the\" subject\" feels\nnnable to refrain from the action, thoughsensibleof iy uRel_ness or absurdity.\nand anrpriaed by the strength of his impulse to perform it.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f284 Peculiarities of Certain Post-Hypnotic States. [April 23,\npurpose that could give it interest, since the\" subject\" did not conceive\nof it as a means to the fulfilment of any end of his own. If he pokes\nthe fire because he is beginning to feel cold, he may very naturally\nremember doing so; but if he pokes it in blind obedience to a\nforgotten suggestion, the act lacks one chief ground for continuance in\nmemory. And again, the moment for the post-hypnotic performances\noften falls, as it has been expressly arranged hy the operator to fall, at\na time when the \"subject's\" attention is being claimed in some other\ndirection-for instance, when he is engaged in animated talk; so that\nthe actions have a fair ch~nce, so to speak, of being performed auto-\nmatically, if they are performed at all. On these grounds, it would\ncertainly seem reasonable to expect that simple actions, commanded\nduring trance, but performed in a conscious waking state and without\nany relapse into a state of temporary trance or trance-waking, might\nsometimes be purely automatic and unconscious.\nExperiment confirms this view up to a certain point. There are\ntransitional cases where the memory seems to have vanished, but can\nwith pains be evoked. Thus, W- s was told in the trance that, when I\ncoughed for the third time, he was to put his hand to his head for a\nmoment; and was then awoke. He obeyed at the third c:>ugh, and then\nfolded his arms. In a few seconds I asked him whether he had moved;\nhe said\" No,\" and looked astonished. I then said that I fancied I had\nseen him put his hand to his head, and he then considered and said,\n\" Oh, yes, I believe I did put it up a moment ago ; I believe I often do\nso.\" He was re-hypnotised, and told that when I coughed for the\nsecond time he was to nod his head at S. He said, \"What, to make\ngame of him'\" (i.e., of me)__nd is amused with the notion. He was\nwoke, and at my second cough, while in the act of conversing with S., he\ngave a distinct nod, at the same time giving a sort of knowing wink in\nmy direction, and joining in S.'slaugh. He apologised\" for laughing at\nMr. Gurney's cough;\" but the nod itself, which seems by association to\nhave revived the sense of amusement, proved to be completely\nforgotten. In the same way P--ll obeyed a command to nod his\nhead at my third cough, and on my asking him immediately afterwards\nwhat he had done, looked puzzled and said, \"Nothing.\" I said I\nthought he had nodded, but he was certain he had not. Shortly after-\nwards, he obeyed the command to put his hand to his head when I\npoked the fire for the second time; but on my questioning him and\nimitating the gesture, he again denied having made it.\nHere, then, we certainly seem to find our fourth class--actions\nperformed in a normal state, and forgotten or unremembered im-\nmediately afterwards. Are we, then, justified in calling these actions\nautomatic and unconscious' Only in a strictly qualified sense, as further\nexamination will show.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f1887.] Peculiarities of Oertain Post-Hypnotic States. 285\nIn the first place, the actions, however easy, transient, and insignifi-\ncant, are remembered on re-\/,yp'''otiBation. I cannot, of course, assert that\nthis rule is invariable; but I have never myself observed an exception.\nFor instance, two days after the incident of the forgotten nod, ahove\nrecounted, W--s was asked in the trance whether he remembered\n\"doing anything on Saturday when Mr. Gurney coughed.\" He\nreplied in a confidential tone, \"When I nodded my head at him'\nHe didn't see me, did he 1\" But even if we had no such\ndirect proofs of a certain awareness accompanying the perfor-\nmanee, we can obtain an indirect proof of a peculiarly interesting\nkind. We can so arrange that the action, though in itself of the\nslightest, shall imply intelligence-shall constitute the intelligent\nreply to a question or remark then and there addressed to the\n\"subject.\" In a case quoted by Mr. Myers (p. 249) Professor Janet's\n\"subject\" maintained a sort of conversation with him by \" automatic\"\nmovements of the hand, while to all appearance fully engaged in an\nordinary conversation with someone else. This occurred during\nhypnotic trance; but I have lately obtained some similar results with\n\" subjects\" in a normal waking state. Now if there be a consciousness\n-beneath or apart from the\" subject's\" normal consciousness-which\nknows that he is answering and what he is answering, we should\nexpect the same consciousness to know how he is answering; and\nin my cases this expectation was confirmed by subsequent hypnotic\nmemory of the whole proceeding.\nS--t was told, in the trance, that he was to answer my questions by\nslightly raising his right-hand for\" yes,\" and his left-hand for\" no.\" He\nwas then woke, and chatted naturally with 8. for some minutes. At\nintervals I addressed some question to him which admitted of a direct\n1\/66 or no reply, and the true answer to which I knew ;-such as, \"Has\nit been raining this afternoon 1\"-\" Have you ever been to London 1\"\n-40nd 80 on. In every case, about ten times in all, the correct answer was\ngiven in the way prescribed, the conversation with 8. proceeding freely\nmeanwhile. Two or three minutes afterwards, I offered 8--t a\nsovereign to tell me what questions I had asked him, and what he had\nbeen doing with his hands-with the usual impunity to my purse. A\nfortnight afterwards, he was asked, in the trance, whether he remem-\nbered having ever carried on a conversation with me by means of\nsignals. At first he did not realise what was referred to; but when\nhands were mentioned, the memory recurred; and when asked whether\nthe signal with the right-hand had not meant No, he replied decidedly,\n\"No, it meant yes.\"\nOn another occasion the same experiment was made with P--l~\nwho, however, was more distinctly impressed with the idea that he could\nnot answer me in the usual manner. The result was slightly ditrerent-r\nDigitized by l::.OOgle\n\f286 Peculiarities of Certain P08t-Hyprwtic States. [April 23,\nthe answers were given correctly by the movements of the handa; but\nmore of what I may call the nonnal attention seemed to be bestowed ~D\nme. Thus if I asked a question immediately after S. had made a remark\nthere would be a moment's pause, and then the signal of response to\nmy question, before S. received his answer; and if I asked a question\nwhile P--ll was in the act of speaking, his words would become\nslightly incoherent, as though a conscious effort were being made to\nlisten at the same time. I was not surprised, therefore, to find that\nhe had a normal consciousness of my addressing him. When asked by\nS. if he heard me speaking, he said, \"Yes, but J cannot answer him.\"\nAsked why, he could not say. The inhibition was now removed, and\nhe talked to me as usual; but it was curious that when his answers were\nof the 'l\/6Il or no type, his hands conti\"\"tMJd to move as directed, the one\nor the other being slightly raised as the answer was spoken. Noticing\nthis, I directed him to say \"yes, yes, yes,\" several times over; the\nright hand punctually kept pace with the lips, and-what was still\nodder-it was impossible to make him aware of the movement.\nThough perfectly himself in every other respect, he obstinately asserted\nthat his hand did not move, and I think it probable that he actually\nwas under the influence of a special form of \"negative hallucination\";\n80 that here the case recalls those of \u00a7 I above, when BOme further\nabnormality of the ~ng species supervened during the fulfil-\nment of a hypnotic order. On being hypnotised, he remembered all\nabout moving his hands, though he still declared that he had not HIm\nthem move.\nIII.\nPOST-HYPNOTIC REOKONING 01' TIME AND COUNTING 01' SIGNALS.\nSo far we have been considering the condition of the \"subject\" at\nthe time during which the command is performed. But questions\nof even greater interest, and al80, it must be confessed, of greater\ndifficulty, present themselves when we consider the intervening period,\nbetween the waking which follows the imposition of the command and the\nsubsequent fulfilment. This period even M. Delbmuf does not venture\nto represent as anything but a piece of normal waking life; 1 and\nostensibly of course that is what it is. Yet it is scarcely necessary to look\nbelow the surface to divine that it has peculiarities; and the deeper we\nlook, the more remarkable will they appear.\nIf no mention of time is made when the command is given, it will\nbe executed on waking. If this is not desired, BOme particular time\nmust be fixed. Thus the command is that the thing is to be done in\nhalf-an-hour, or in 80 many minutes after waking. Here, then, the\n1 Rewe PhiloaopMgtltl for February, 1887, ~ 127.

This is what is generally assumed to occur in the common case\nof determining to wake, and waking, at some unaccustomed hour; and\nas long as the hypnotic command extends to only a short time ahead,\nthat analogy seems plausible enough. M. Delbreuf considers the matter\nso plain that he dismisses it in a sentence. The explanation is \"des\nplus simples,\" and is this :-Every command given to a \"subject\" to\nperform a certain act at a future time, is at once formulated by him in\nthese terms, \" Yau will fall into a trance at meh and I'UCh a moment,\nand then you will perform the act.\" The\" subject's\" mind is then\nrelieved of responsibility, and goes oft' duty; and his bodily machine goes\nto sleep, as the sleeper's bodily machine wakes, by its own automatic\nmachinery. The explanation is certainly simple enough; but it has the\ndefect of being a pure guess, unsupported by a single fact: no hypnotic\n4'subject\" has ever confessed to formulating his orders in any suchfashion\nas M. Delbreuf represents.\nBut even if we could accept the assumption of the purely physio-\nlogical hypothesis for cases of short duration-where the idea of the\nperiod can be distinctly realised and the setter of the alarum sees\nexactly what he is about-it would be a far cry to extend it to the well-\nknown commands t.i longue Echeance, as where the thing is to be done\nafter 6 months' or a year's interval. I do not think that the peculiarities\nof the time-reckoning overlong periods have ever received quitejust treat-\nment; they have either been too much extenuated, or magnified into\nsomething incredibly marvellous.\nA distinction must first be made between cases where a date is\nnamed-4l8pecially if the date be a marked one, such as January 1st,\nor the anniversary of the day of the command l-and cases where\nsimply a length oftime is named, not immediately suggestive of a par-\nticular date, as in the direction to do such and such a thing cc on the\n69th day from this.\" In the former case the impression of the date\nmight be immediately registered in the brain, in association with that\nof the order, and the mere arrival of the date might thus suffice to\nrevive the order. But how is a length of time to be so\n1 It is unfortunate that in some of the best known cases of commands\na longue ~cMance. such dates have been selected; but the proof of the\nphenomenon does not depend on these cases.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f288 Peculiarities of \u00b7Certain P08t-Hypnotic States. [April 23,\nregistered t Its further end, till reckoned out by the aid of the\ncalendar, is perfectly indefinite; and there is nothing in the mere\narrival of the day calculated to revive the terms of the order-\nit carries no more aixty-nintlllnu8 about it than any other day.\nM. Paul Janet has described such \" length of time as in fact\nan abstraction-meaning that the mention of it awakens no\ndistinct image or series of images; and he refuses to believe\nthat abstract time can be accurately measured, since tIns would\nimply some totally unknown faculty. 1 I cannot think that Professor\nBeaunis fairly meets this objection by pointing out that \"a day\"\nrepresents a serieR of conscious impressions and unconscious\norganic reactions, and that there are periodic organic changes\nwhich extend over weeks, months, and seasons-that animals\nknow their feeding-time, and that attacks of fever recur at regular\nintervals. His conclusion from these facts is that \"the measure-\nment of time is not an abstraction, but has its roots and\nconditions in the very life of the orga.nism.\"2 But, in the first\nplace, though \"a day\" may be a sufficiently familiar and definite\nunit to present a concrete character, it does not follow that\nthis is the case with \"69 days.\" And, in the second pla.oe, the\norganic conditions which are just what the measurement of established\nphysiological periods ip80 facto has, are just what the measurement of\nperiods suddenly and arbitrarily fixed by human volition has not. The\nvital processes will no more work out such a measurement as this than\na. school-boy's digestion will work out a proposition of Euclid. How-\never carried through, it is at least not a function of animal life. It\nissues in a perfectly needless act, not in an inevitable bodily state;\nand it depends, not on progressive changes in the stomach or the\nblood, but on a quite original course of cerebration, proceeding, we\ncannot doubt, in the higher tracts of the brain, having been initiated\nby an impression-that of the command-winch had a distinct\npsychical side. 'Now looking at the brain-side alone, we should\nconclude, I think, that the passage of time must be registered, not by\nany general gradual change, but by a series of specific changes,\ncorresponding probably to the days or unitB of measurement.S We\nshould conclude, that is, tha.t cerebral events of the sort normally\ncorrelated with the ideas\" sixty,\" \"sixty-one,\" \"sixty-two,\" &c., really ,\ntake place; for how otherwise could the gulf be spanned with I\nprecision t how would any other sort of change know when to stop, or\n1 Revue Politique et LitUraire, for August 16th, 1884.\nI Le Somnambliliame Provoqu~, pp. 139\u00b7141.\nI Cf, the reckoning and registration of units in a later C&Il8 (p. 313).

But if the\nspecifie brain-changes take place, does it not seem at least a reasonable\nsurmise that their mental correlate may exist, though hidden from our\nview-that there may further be an actual watching of the course of\ntime 11 Such a hypothesis would in great part remove M. Paul Janet's\ndifficulty; for the \"unknown faculty\" would simply be a known\nfaculty, working in a normal way, but below the surface of normal\nconsciousness.\nMost of the evidence bearing on this subject will find its appro-\npriate place in the next section; but a few facts may be given here.\nM. Delbmuf's record contains two cases which are very much\nin point. M-- was told, when entranced, that ~ 10 minutes (di:J: was\nvery likely understood as liz) she was to take Mlle. Delbmufs slipper\nfrom her foot, remove a nail from its heel, and put it back on the\nowner's foot. On being woke, she looked at the clock, and kept\nglancing at the clock and at Mlle. Delbmuf during six minutes, when\nshe executed the order. In this case there was doubtless consciousness\n(in the ordinary sense) of consulting the clock, and probably a waking\nmemory of it, as M. Delbmuf seems to say that the memory of the\nincident was complete.\nIn the next example we have probably a similiar consciousness of\nwatching the time, without the waking memory. A chemist had been\ntold, when entranced, that five minutes after waking he was to fetch a\nbottle of ammonia from a neighbouring shop. He was woke, and\ntalked naturally to those present; but he looked at the clock\nimmediately on waking, and kept looking at it at intervals. At the\nend of five minutes, he put on his hat and went out, re-appeared with\nthe ammonia, and took his place again among the bystanders, remarking,\n\"Why, have I not just been ouU\" He was then informed what he\nhad done, to his great astonishment. This case seems intermediate\nbetween the former one and those where the watching is of a wholly\ninterior kind, and is not only forgotten afterwards, but is accompanied\nby no consciousness of which thA normal l!aking \"subject\" can render\nany accoul1t; but which still, I believe, involves mental action of a sort.\n1 It is worth remarking that, if there be such a mental watclaing, then we\nhave .. freeh argument for the view of .. automatic\" actions maintained in the\npreceding section. For there would at least be a strong pl\"ellumption that the\naction up to which the watching leads, and which puts an end to it, however\nalight and inl4gnilicant it may be, has itself some sort of mental existence.\nI find that the same idea of a con'inued reckoning has occurred to Profeeaor\nPierre Janetand Mr. Myers, Iipropo8 of Bome experiments of the former (p. 239).\nThe general view, in this and in the following section, as to evidenoe of second-\nary intelligenoe, is I think identical with that of Mr. Myers. . . C\u00b7 I\nDigitized by <lP8 e\n\f290 Peculiarities of Certain Post-Hypnotic State8. [April 23,\nHere are a couple of instances of this extremer kind. My\" subject,\"\nW---a, was one day told that on the 39th day from then,at 9.30 p.m., he\nwas to come and call 8n a gentleman resident in the houae where I was\nlodging, with whom he had no acquaintance. He of course had no\nmemory of this direction, when awake. No reference was made to the\ncommand till March 19th, when he was suddenly asked, in the trance,\nhow many days had elapsed since it was given. He instantly said, 16;\nand added that there were 23 more to run, a.nd that the day when he\nwas due was Easter Monday.! All these statements were correct. But\nthe odd thing was that, on further questioning, he misdated both the\nday of the order and the day of fulfilment, calling the former March 1st,\nand the latter April 12th, whereas they were respectively March 3rd\nand April 11tho This makes it tolerably clear that he did not originally\narrive at the date of fulfilment by immediate reckoning from the date\nof command, and then fix it in his mind simply as a date. (Easter\nMonday, when BO near as 23 days, might be arrived at in a moment by\nremarking the day of the week.) Moreover if he made March 1st his\ntermmus II fJ'IMJ, he ought to have Mid 18 instead of 16, and would\nprobably have had to pause to reckon. The reasonable interpretation\nof the result is surely that he was iu BOme way actually counting the\ndays as they passed.\nIn the next case, which occurred after the above remarks were\nwritten, I got an actual account of the process, which singularly\nconfirms them. P--ll was told, on March 26, that on the 123rd day\nfrom then he was to put a blank sheet of paper in an envelope, and\nsend it to a friend of mine whose name and residence he knew, but\nwhom he had never seen. The subject was not referred to again till\nApril 18, when he was hypnotised, and asked if he remembered any-\nthing in connection with this gentleman. He at once repeated the\norder, and said, \"This is the 23rd day; a hundred more.\"\nS. \" How do you know' Have you noted each day' \"\nP--LL. \"No; it seemed natural.\"\nS. \"Have you thought of it often'\"\nP--LL. \"It generally strikes me in the morning, early.\nSomething seems to say to me, \u2022You've got to count.'''\nS. \"Does that happen every day 1\"\nP--LL. \"No, not every day-perhaps more like every other\nday. Itgoes from my mind; I never think of it during the day. I\nonly know it's got to be done.\"\nQuestioned further, he made it clear that the interval between\nthese impressions was never long enough to be doubtful. He\" may\n1 Unfortunately the accident of the tcMancs on Easter Monday prevented\nthe execution of the order, &8 W-s went off on \u2022 holiday excursion for the\nwhole \u2022\u2022y.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f1887.] Peculiarities of Certain Post-Hypnotic States. 291\nnot think of it for 2 or 3 days; then something seems to tell him.\" He\nwas questioned again on April 20, and at once said, .. That's going on\nall right; twenty-five days\"; and on April 22, when in the trance, he\nspontaneously recalled the subject, and added, \"Twenty-seven days.\"\nAfter he was woke on April 18, I asked him if he knew the gentleman\nin question, or had been thinking about him. He was clearly surprised\nat the question, said he fancied he had once seen him in my room\n(which, however, was not the case), and that the idea of him had never\nsince crossed his mind.\nBut there is another way in which the moment for the performance\nof the action can be fixed. The\" subject\" can be told to perform it\nwhen some signal is given-as when someone gives a cough, or pokes\nthe fire. Now here again we might perhaps conceive that the organism\nsets itself for the receipt of the signal, just as it has been supposed to\nset itself for the expiration of a certain period of time; and that the\nsignal touches the trigger, so to speak, and lets oft\" the associated\naction, without any psychical expectancy being involved, and, it\nmay be, without any consciousness of what is done. But we\ncan arrange the conditions in such a way as again to involve\nreckoning of a certain kind, and of a kind which it is hard to conceive\nas having no mentation of any sort associated with it. For instance,\nthe direction may be to perform the act when someone coughs for the\nthird time, or pokes the fire for the fourth time. The first cough\ncomes; it does not release the trigger, but its occurrence is somehow\nmarked. The second cough in like manner does not release the trigger;\nbut it is not only marked, but is somehow related to the former one.\nAnd when the third cough comes, the trigger is released not merely by\nthe sound of it, but by that sound as related to the two previous ones.\nI would not venture to assert II priori that all this reckoning cannot be\nof a purely physiological kind, though I think that the presumption\nwould be the other way. But again experiment comes to our aid. If\nthe\" subject\" be re-hypnotised before the final cough-say the fourth\n-has been given, and questioned as to what has passed, he showl\nclearly that he remembers being in the attitude of expectancy for the\ncoming signal. Sometimes the hidden mental condition during the\ntime of waiting, has been a very curious one. Thus W--s, who had\nbeen told that at my fifth cough the candles would go out, then woke,\nand then hypnotised again before the final cough had been given, dis-\nowned all memory of the four coughs which had been actually given, but\nknew that the next would be the fifth, \" because then the candles would\ngo out.\" At other times the signals have been clearly and correctly\ncounted; and the memory of them on re-hypnotisation is certainly no~\nthe mere memory of observations made by the normal waking\nconsciousness; since sounds or movements of which the \"~l.Jj~ct't\"\nDigitized by ~8 e\n\f292 Peculiarities of Certain P08t-Hypnotic States. [April 23,\nnormal consciousness takes no heed as they occur, and of which his\nwaking self, when interrogated, can give no account~ equa.lly serve the\npurpose of signals, and are shown by the answers given in trance to\nhave been duly reckoned. Thus when the signal ha.s been one of a\nseries of usual and unimpressive actions, such as coughs or pokings of\nthe fire in winter, I have several times, while the series was in progress\nbut before the critical point was reached, asked the \"subject\" if he\nhad noticed that I had a cough, or if he could tell me how often I have\npoked the fire, and have been answered in the negative.\nIt is easy to superpose one series of signals on another. Thus, W--s\nwas hypnotised, and told to wind up a ball of string when I coughed\nfor the third time. Another experiment followed, IUld then he was told\nthat, when I poked the fire, he was to sort a pack of cards, and put all\nthe diamonds together. Again an experiment of a diiferent kind\nfollowed, after which he was woke. I gave two coughs, and then, com-\npletely forgetting the command relating to the fire, I poked that\nelement. W- s seized the cards, and in a few moments I perceived how\nmatters stood. I therefore gave my third cough, when he at once put\ndown the cards, and asked for some string. I said I had none;\nwhereupon he got up to look, found the string, and began winding it,\nhaving first repossessed himself of the cards. When the winding was\ncompleted, he took the cards and sorted out the diamonds.1 Another\ntime, P--ll was given 6 orders, each of which was to be fulfilled\nat an &8Bigned point in one of 6 different series of signals. This\nhowever proved rather beyond his capacity; all the things were\ndone, but only two immediately on the right signal, three othera\nfollowing their signals by a considerable interval, and one being done\nat S.'s eighth cough instead of at his sixth. It would be interesting\nto discover with a well-educated \"subject\" to what extent parallel\nseries of signals of this sort could be multiplied, without confusion\nensuing. If it proved to equal or exceed the extent of his normal capacity,\nhis subsequent hypnotic memory might afford even stronger demonstra-\ntion as to the psychical nature of the reckoning; as he might be able to\ndescribe the relations between the series, and his mode of keeping them\ndistinct.\nIV.\nVARIOUS EXHIBITIONS OF SECONDARY INTELLIGENCE.\nThe experiments which follow are of a more novel kind. Though\ntame and rudimentary enough, compared with the only hitherto-\n1 In this case it proved impossible to recall to his memory, during the\nfulfilment of the commands,even quite recent imprellllioDS belonging to the time\nof trance: and there was DODO of that change of physiognomy which was I!()\nmarked in the case where that experiment succeeded (p. 274).\nDigi\n\f1387.] Peculiarities of Oertain Post-Hypnotic States. 293\nrecorded case to which they seem at all akin-the dramatic self-duplica-\ntion of Prof. Janet's patient (pp. 237-45)-they present at anyratethia\nadvantage, that they had no connection with hysterical conditions, but\nwere conducted with normal healthy\" subjects\"; and can therefore be\nrepeated and extended without fear of a disappearance like Adrienne's.\nTheir results form a yet further stage in the history of the post-hypnotic\ndevelopment of hypnotic impressions. They present once more the\nphenomena of intelligent automatism, like the hand-conversations of\n\u00a7 II.; and they illustrate the latent rec~oning of time, and observation\nof signals, like the cases of \u00a7 III.; but they exhibit in a more direct\naud conspicuous way than either a secondal\u00b7y memory and secondary\nplay of mind in the post-hypnotic state, and the severance of the\nnorm,\" or primary from the latent or secondary consciousness. In\nthe hand\u00b7conversations, we have no reason to suppose this severance\nto have been complete. In P--ll's mind my questions and 8.'.\nremarks were certain!y present together, on the same plane of\nconsciousness; and as regards 8--t, though the point needs further\ntrials, my belief is that, if asked by 8. what I had said immediately\nafter one of my questions, he also would have been able to reply. In\nthe cases which follow, the secondary \"self\" took its own course,\nin such complete independence of what passed during its latent period,\nwhile the primary \"self\" was ostensibly in possession of the field,\nthat external impressions then received passed unregarded, and there\nwas no moment at which the doings of the two selves were juxtaposed\nor associated in normal consciousness. Again, as regards the hidden\nprocesses of mentation during the period preceding the fulfilment\nof a command, our evidence so far has been derived from the state-\nments made by the \"subject\" when once more in a state of trance.\nBut we shall now be able to ascertain the workings of this secondary\nconsciousness in the reckoning of time and signals, without any previous\ncalling of it to the front by re.hypnotisation; its work is not only done,\nbut tested, while the normal self remains uninterruptedly in the\nascendent, and shows absolutely no sign of change. And yet again,\nwe shall now'find manifestations of other sorts of reflection and\ncalculation, which go considerably beyond mere temporal me&llurements\nin the degree of hidden psychical activity which they involve. The-\nmedium of all these further results is no other than our old friend,\nplanchette-that delicate little recorder of which it will soon, I believe,\nbe said, with even more truth and point than of the astrologer'S charts\nor the alchemist's crucibles and re-agents, that Time's revenges have\nturned the blindly-handled tool of superstition into the indispensable\ninstrument of science.\nI will begin with the simpler cases, which involved memory, but not\nindependent thought. On March 16th I showed P-.-.ll a v1anch~\nDigitized by ~0081e\n\f294 Peculiarities of Certain Post-Hypnotic States. [April 23.\n-he had ne\\\"er seen or touched one before~nd got him to write his\nname with it. He was then hypnotised, and told that it had been as\ndark as night in London on the previous day, and that he would be able\nto write what he had heard. He was woke, and as usual was offered\na 80vereign to say what it was that he had been told. He was\nthen placed with his hand on the planchette, a large screen being held\nin front of his face, 80 that it was impos'lible for him to see the paper\nor instrument. In lASS thllon a minlltA t.he writing began. The words\nwere,\nIt WtJ8 tJ do.r1c day in London yuUrday.\nHe professed, as did all the \"subjects\" on every occasion, complete\nignorance as to what he had written; and I believe with perfect\ntruth. I repeatedly expressed a desire to know, and offered the\n80vereign if they would tell me j but their account was always that the\ninstrument took their hand with it, and that they could not detect\nwhat letters it formed. They showed no curiosity in the matter, and\nI did not urge them to try to interpret the movements, which, no\ndoubt, could be done with practice.\nIn the next experiment the statement impressed on the \"Rubject ..\nwas, \"There were six inches of snow in London this morning\" j but\nnothing was said to him as to subsequently writing it. The writing,\nhowever, appeared as before, \"There was 6 inches of snow.\" and then\nan illegible jumble of lines MUsed by the pencil going over the same\nspot again and again, instead of progressing from left to right. I\nobserved this, but up to this point I did not watch thE! process of\nwriting~ rule which I observed in nearly all Ca8f'B. P--ll WAS\nthen re-hypnotiaed, and S. said to him several times, emphatically,\n\"P--ll, John Jones is coming.\" He was so deeply entranced that\nhe showed no sign of even hearing. The planchette reproduced the\nwhole remark,\nP--ll, John Jorw is coming.\nThe next statement was\" Robert Brown has gone.\" Being roused a\nlittle, P--ll remarked, .. He must go, then; he needn't wait for me.\"\nWhen completely woke, he was, as usual, offered the sovereign to repeat\nwhat he had been told. The planchet.te at once produced the words.\nThen followed a curious example of the reality of hypnotic ra.pport.\nIn the trance P--ll is sometimes able to hear me, as well as S. j I\ntherefore made the next statement myself-\" There is a high tide to-\nnight \"-to which he replied, \"I thought it was a low one,\" proving\nthat he hlUl heard and understood. He is now placed before the planchette\nas before, but no writing occurs, and he says his hand feels no impulae to\nmove. The same process is repeated with the same result.

In about a minute P--ll\nemerged into an odd state in which he would not answer me, or take\nany notice of me when I touched him. He got up spontaneously, walked\nto the planchette, put his hand on it, and wrote as in a kind of dream,\nThere kill tJ going 10 be tJ Higk tide.\nHe returned to the sofa, and sat without moving, with open eyes.\nWhen S. returned, and roused him a little, he deni~ writing, and\nseemed unaware of having done anything. Re-hypnotised and ques-\ntioned, he remembered writing about a high tide, and said that he did\nit to remind himself of it.\nS. now told him that I was going to tell him something, and that\nhe WIlB to wake in a minute and write it; and then left the room. I\ntold him, \" It is a good year for salmon.\" In about a minllte p--n\nwoke after a fashion, and sat with open eyes, and his hands on his knees,\nusing gestures as if trying to recollect something. I recalled\nS., who woke him thoroughly, and he laid his hand on the planchette.\nI failed at first sight to decipher the writing, and asked that it should\nbe repeated. But the instrument did not move, and P--ll said that\nhe felt no tendency towards movement. Here, we may observe, is an\nindication that the secondary (writing) self 1 had a purely transient\nexistence. A\" subject\" who is in any state in which he can 'lNJ'l\"btJUy\ntell one something that he has heard in the trance, could always be\nmade to repeat his words. But here the\" subject,\" whose hand wrote\nhe knew not what, was completely himself; he had not suffered the\nvery slightest relapse towards a trance-waking state; and there was no\nway of getting. through his ears, at his secondary intelligence, which,\nhaving performed its task, had probably lapsed beyond recall.\nFortunately its aid could be dispensed with, as on examining the\nwriting again, I had no difficulty in making out,\nWrite Mr. Gum6'lJ .ometki\",,!\/-\na crowning instance of the special rtJPPort with the operator, since the\nreproduction was of S.'s preliminary direction, and not of the remark\nof mine which it was the precise object of that direction to get\nreproduced.\n1 The word \"aelf\" is too convenient to be dispensed with, but must not be\nmisunderstood. In luch C8888 88 these, the \"aeeondary aeIf\" is a mere rudi\u00b7\nment of a personality: it is no more than a short connected train of intelligence\nof whoae activities and products the normal self is unaware.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f296 PectWi.aritieB of Certain Post-H'!fJYfItOf,ic State8. [April 23,\nThroughout these and subsequent trials, P--ll described the\nsensation in his hand and arm, which accompanied the writing, as very\npeculiarand disagreeable-as like\" pins and needles,\" and\" galvanic\nshocks,\" He certainly suffered considerably, and conceived a strong\naversion to the instrument.\nThe experiments with W- s began in a very similar way; bot the\nfirst results were more striking, as no direction as to writing was given\nhim in the trance. He was emphatically told, .. George Robinson is\ndead,\" was woke, offered a sovereign if he could repeat what he had\nbeen told, and then placed with his hand on planchette, the screen\nbeing held as usual between his eyes and the paper. Almost at once the\nwords George Robinson were written. W-s, like P--ll, described\na curious sensation in the right arm (which, however, in his case WI\\S\nless distressing), and also the way in which the instrument seemed to\ntake his hand with it. Re-hypnotised, he was told \"Timothy Stokes\nhas died.\" He was amused at this, and said that if he had such a\nname he would change it.' He was woke, to the usual oblivion; but\nthe planchette under his hand socn produced the complete sentence.\nHe was then re.hypnotised, and asked what he had writt6n. He said,\n.. W-s.\" That was a reminiscence of his having been made to write\nhis name when he came in, to teach him how to hold his hand on the\ninstrument. He remembered having subsequently had his hand on it,\nand that it had moved; but that was all. This result was exceptional;\non re-hypnotisation, the .. subject\" could as a rule repeat, either\nperfectly or approximately, what he had written.\nIn other results, which were failures in relation to what was\nintended, the reproduction was of just the same type. Thus P--ll,\nafter being told in the trance to count the number of letters in\" A\nrolling stone gathers no moss,\" and then instantly woke, simply\nwrote,\n.A rolling ,tone 1161761' qatker. no moB\u2022\u2022\nTold that he was to poke the fire in 6 minutes, and that I should\nwant to know how the time was going, without any directions as to\nwriting, he wrote, soon after waking,\nP--ll will you poke the fire in 6 minuett..\nAs a rule, the writing was legible, uninterrupted, and correct,\nor contained only such mistakes as the .. subject's\" normal writing\nmight show; and his manner and conversation meanwhile were\nwholly free and unconcerned. It is important to observe how\ndistinct the difference is here from the cases above described of\npost-hypnotic fulfilment of commands--even from those when the\ndeviation from normality was the slightest. Not only does the\n\" subject\" show none of that absorption with h~ work1 or im-\nDigitized by ~008 e\n\f1887.] Peculiaritie8 of Oertain Post-Hypnotic States. 297\npatience of interference, which we observed in many of the cases\nwhen ha was fully conscious of his proceedings-e.g., when he was\nsorting cards or winding up a ball of string j but he equally lacked the\nsense of impulse or desire which prompted and accompanied the\nperformance of normal-seeming acts (p. 270). When his hand was\nactually laid on the planchette, there was a sort of physical impulsion,\nwhich he described as seeming to cODle rather from the instrument than\nfrom himself j but if his hand was removed, there was no desire to\nreplace it, or to get the writing produced. Each of the \"subjects.\"\nP--ll especially, would have gladly been excused the proces~. This\nis just what we might expect, on the view of that more complete segrega-\ntion of states of which I have spoken. The normal self has here beeu from\nthe first, so to speak, relieved of all responsibility j no attention and no\nvolition on its part had to come into play, the secondary consciousness\nbeing wholly adequate to what was required. No doubt a definite\ncommand, impressed on the hypnotic state, to write something with the\nplanchette at a. given time or signal, might be obeyed in the\u00b7 same way,\nand under the same mental conditions, as the sorting of the cards or the\nwinding of the string-as in the case above given, in which P--ll\nwrote about lfue high tide. But the rule was that the hypnotic\nimpression should be given in a different way from this. Either no\ndirection to write was given at all, or the direction was put\nhypothetically-as, if I required to know something afterwards, it was\nto be written for me. The consequence was that the\" subject\" never\nwent to the planchette of his own accord; it had no interest for him.\nIn the former cases, when he did not see the cards or the string or\nwhatever he was to manipulate, he would ask for them, or look for\nthem till he found them. With the planchette, on the contrary, there\nwas no ma.nifestation of anything in his mind, or of any impulse that\nneeded a vent, till his hand was actually placed on the instrument at\nmy desire; after which the secondary consciousness took undivided\ncharge of the results.\nI will give a few more instances where no suggestion of any sort\nwas made about writing, and where the only difference between\nthe statement made to the\" subject,\" and any other that might be made\nto him during trance, consisted in some amount of repetition of it. On\nMarch 18th, W-s (who is a baker) was told, with considerable insist-\nance, \"The baking trade is failing.\" He was then woke, and departed.\nAs soon as he arrived next day, he was set down to the planchette.\nSeveral minutes elapsed, and then the instrument slowly produced the\nwords,\nTl\/,6 baking trade is jailing.\nThere seems to have been some very slight emergence of the idea.\ninto his normal consciousness; as, while the writing was proceed-\nDigi\n\f298 Peculiaritiu of Oertain Post-H'Y'J!1Wtic States. [April 23,\ning, he said that someone seemed to be \" holloaing\" in his ear\nsomething-be could not make out wha~bout tbe baking trade.\nBut he was quite unaware of what his hand had produced, and\neven when re-hypnotised, he could not at first be sure whether he\nhad written the words, or whether S. had \"holloaed\" them at.\nhim. After a time, however, he remembered, and described the\nwriting, whicb had been very irregular as to the arrangement of lines,1\nexactly as if he had it before him. He said, \"Yes, I see tIM .. but it\nain't like my writing, it looks like a little youngster's.

Clairooyancs was out of the question, as I proved by\ntesting him in other cases where he professed (as hypnotised persona 80\noften do) to Bee things which were out of the range of his normal\nvision.\nOnce more, in the course of an experiment on the stages of memory\n(see my subsequent paper) P--ll had got a confusion into his head\nabout a whale in a green tank at the Aquarium, and a swimming\nentertainment given by Miss Webb on the pier. Another experiment\nintervened, and he was then put down to the planchette. I did not\nexpect him to write anything, and had no idea what memory, if any,\nwould be in the ascendant.

I found that he could now remember a\nDumber of things of which he was ignorant in his normal state; and\nI therefore thought it a good opportunity to try whether a hallucination\ncould be suddenly imposed on him. At my request, S. tells him that\nS--t bas entered the room. He looks up aDd says, .. Ah, S--t, sit\ndown,\" and addresses S-t several times, while continuing to sort the\ncards. He is now taken to the planchette. He calls the imaginary\nS--t to come and sit beside him, places a chair for him, patronises\nhim, and says he will write his name. He then writes, very rapidly,\nCards are all so'reed.\nHe was repeatedly asked what he had written, as at first I could\nnot make it out, and he answered repeatedly, \"Sort W.\" The\nword .. sorted\" on the last piece of paper used closely resembled\nthis. Still questioned, he said he had written S-t's name, and\npointing to the word \"Cards,\" he spelt out S-_t.1 He was now\nroused into normality, and at once hypnotised again. Asked what he\nhad written, he instantly replied, co Cards are all sorted.\" Here, then,\nwe have the spontaneous action of the secondary consciousness, giving\ninformation as to the execution of the order, while the self which was\nconnected with the superimposed hallucination had a quite separate idea.\nWithout the aid of the planchette, we should never have been able to\nget a glimpse beyond the hallucinated state, which had itself carried the\ndeviation from normality to the point of completely developed trance.\nThroughout this section I have been speaking of the secondary\nprocesses as intelligtmt-as involving mentation. Let us now examine\nfor a moment how far this view of them is justified. How far might\nthe results be attributed to a purely physiological or unconscious\n1 On two subsequent occasions, however, P-ll did spontaneously speak\nof somo of these previous lIypnotic impresaions-earrying his confusion further,\nand remarking on the oddity of a green whale.

[April 23.\nmemory t In the cases where the idea of a future writing was conveyed\nto the\" subject\" at the same time that the statement was made, one\nmight recur to the old hypothesis of a \"setting of the organism,\" and\n&\\n exclusively automatic performance. The hypothesis presents more\ndifficulty, perhaps, in respect of the cases where no mention of writing\nhad been made, and where consequently there could haye been no regis-\ntration in the \" subject's\" organism of the idea of future manifestation\nin connection with the special idea impressed on him. The impression. for\ninstance, of the whale and Mias Webb was made without a hint as to\nthe future-without the slightest suggestion that it either must or\ncould or would work out any ostensible result to the end of time. Yet\na manifest result emerges, in the midst of quite irrelevant surround-\nings and experiences, as soon as the opportunity of \"automatic\"\nrepresentation is given. Here the organism cannot have been specially\nset for the effect. If the action was completely automatic, we should at\nany rate have to attribute to hypnotic inlpressions a very singular\npeculia.rity-that of storing up energy in the brain which will\nmechanically work outwards along the motor nerves, as soon as the\nmeans are presented whereby the act of writing is made sufficiently\neasy for the muscles. But the really strong argument for mentation\nof a sort is the old fact, the memory on re-hypnotisation. The\n.. subjllct\" then remembers what he has written, and remembers\nthe writing of those particular words-not merely the general act of\nwriting, and not meJ'\\jly the impressed formula. This is surely a strong\nindication that the writing WM accompanied by intelligent apprehen-\nsiol1 of the words.\nNow at this point the question cannot but occur, what light do\nsuch results throw on the nature of \"intelligent automatism\" in\ngeneral! In the well-known cases where planchette-writers have\nproduced words and sentences which were at first a puzzle to themselves,\nbut which, when deciphered, proved to have a meaning,l it has never\nueeu possible to ascertain how far the process was purely physiological\nand unconscious, and how far it might have a truly psychical character.\nNow the above experiments at any rate afford strong support to\nthe view that a great deal of planchette-writiug, and of other\nforms of intelligent automatism, however much severed from normal\nconsciousness, is nevertheless accompanied hy true psychosis. It\nwould be extremely interesting, if the opportunity ever offered, to\ntry the effect of hypnotisation on some \"automatic\" writer before he\nhad deciphered or realised what his hand had produced; and we might\nbe quite prepared to find that in the trance he would be able to inform\nus what the writing was.\nThere is, no doubt, a difference between such an experiment and\nJ See, e.g., the caaes cited by Mr. Myers, Procudina8rVnJrl)Jf.ePP, 26,37.\nDlgltlzed!'iy uOV(S1\n\f1887.] Peculiaritiea of Certain P08t-Hypnotic Statea. 301\nthe post-hypnotic cases above described, which prevents us from\npredicting with certainty that the results would be similar. For the\nmemory of the post-hypnotic writing may have been stimulated and\naided by the memory, which would naturally recur on re-hypnotisation,\nof the previous hypnotic impression; and, moreover, it may quite\nwell be that hypnotisation, though it brings to the front the memory\nbelonging to a train of secondary intelligence which was it&elf Bet\ngoing in hypnotic trance, might not have the same effect in other\ncases. But the general fact remains that it is possible for writing\nto be discerned and understood, in spite of the normal self's\ncomplete unawareness of it; and there seems no ground whatever\nfor confining this possibility to cases where the content of the\nwriting has first entered the mind during the hypnotic trance.\nThe hypnotic remembrance supplies the subsequent test, but the\nwriting is not produced in the hypnotic state; and the probability\ntherefore is that the conditions of the writinl( are general, and have no\nspecial peculiarities connected with hypnotisol. So far as discernment\nof the writing is concerned, we are justified in surmising that post-\nhypnotic and ordinary \"automatic\" scripts are on a par.\nBut there is a further point. There are cases where the words and\nsentences produced by planchette-writers have proved to be revivals of\nlatent or forgotten knowledge, connected perhaps with some far-distant\nperiod of life; that is to say, the result distinctly implies me'TTW't\"'!I.1\n1 The record8 of 8ucb CMe8 are tolerably numerous; but the subject has\nprobably not yet got beyond the stage when every piece uf authentic evidence\nhAIl a certain value. I venture, therefore, to record the following experience,\nwhich made a very deep impression on me, being in fact my introductiun to\n.. psychical research.\" In 1870, I watched and took part in a good deal of\nplanchette,writing, but not with r8IIults or under conditions that afforded\nproof of any separate intelligence. However, I was sufficiently struck by what\noccurred to broach the \"ubject to a hard\u00b7headed mathematical friend, who\nexpressed complete incredulity as to the possibility of obtaining rational\nwriting, except through the conscious operation of IOOme person in contact with\nthe instrument. After a long argument, he at last agreed to make a trial. I\nhad not really the faintest hope of succesa, and he was committed to the\nposition that success was impOllllible. We sat for some minutes with a hand\nof each on the planchette, and- asked that it should write some line of\nShakespeare. It began by see\u00b7sawing and producing a great deal of formless\nscribble; but then there seemed to be more method in the movements, and a\nline of hieroglyphics appeared. It took U8 some time to make it out, the\nwriting being illegible to just that degree .which at. first baffles the reader, but\nwhich afterwards leaves no more doubt as to its having been correctly\ndeciphered than if it were print. And there the line indubitably atood-A little\nmore than kin and Ius than kind. Now, as neither of us bad been thinking of\nthis line, or of any lille (for we had been wholly occupied with the IItraggling\nmovements of the instrument,) the result, though not demonstrative, is at any\nrate strongly suggestive of a true underground psychosis. For it would be hard\nto believe that we got what we asked for through mere cerebral ~iationpf\nDigitized by ~008le\n\f302 Peculiarities of Certain Post-HYlfflotic States. [April 23,\nNow, what is the nature of this memory! It might be of a purely\nphysiological and unconscious kind, even though the content of the\nwriting W&8 shown by subsequent remembrance in trance to have been\nintelligently discerned j for the intelligent discernment of the content\ndoes not in itself imply more than what occurs when we look over some\none else's shoulder, and follow the words that he is writing j that is to\nsay, the words might be intelligently read, though wholly mechanically\n\"nUm.l What one wanta to know is whether something beyond this\nis involved-whether the idea which the writing conveys presented\nitself to the secondary self as a mental experience, prior to and apart\nfrom the writing, just as memories, often long-buried memories, are\nliable to present themselves on the ordinary mental stage. Do our\npost-hypnotic results suggest any answer to this question f The\nmajority of those so far recounted must be allowed, I think, to be\ncompatible with the hypothesis of a purely organic or non-psychical\nmemory. P--ll's reproductions of statements in the exact form in\nwhich they had been made to him, commencing with his own name in\nthe vocative, have every appearance of mere unintelligent echoes; and\nit is difficult to see how any scripts which simply reproduced statements\npreviously heard, could be decisive as to anything beyond this. One\nor two of my C&Ses do, however, indicate something beyond. Thus\nP--ll W&8 told, in the trance, to count the number of letters in\nthe lines, \"When the day is over, And the night is drawing nigh,\"\nand was then immediately woke. The planchette produced, under his\nhand, not the number of the letters, but the line\nWhen II eM day over.\nThis was a failure, then, as regards the result sought, and at first sight\nideas. The 8IIIIOciation of this verse with the idea of Shakespeare is com-\nparatively a loose one--decidedly looser, for instance, than its association with\nthe idea of Hamlet, though closer than its &II8OCiation with the idea of English\nliterature. That is to say, a search and a selection were made, in conformity\nwith an intelligent requirement. H anyone would confidently asaign such\noperations to the domain of .. unconscions cerebration,\" it would be interesting\nto know where he would draw the line. II there any intelligent result of which\nbe would regard psychosis as a condition? It is worth adding that, if the\npsychical character of .. intelligent automatism \" is ever made clear, there will\nbe ground for suspecting a psychical side to all the supposed feats of\n.. unconscious cerebration \"-e.g., where the correct solution of a problem baa\nseemed suddenly to occur in dream.\n1 It is worth noting, however, that in a case where I had guided W__'s\nhand to write some words with the planchette, with thescreen as usual betweeD\nhis eyea and the paper, be said, when afterwards hypnotised, that I had written\naomething which he coula1Wt read, though he had Been it (p. 298). That is, the\nmuscular sight did not involve comprehension when the writing was indis\u00b7\nputably meclll~nical.\nI The only clear points in this word are the wand the tall stroke of the A.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f1887.] Peculiarities of Oertain P08t-H'!fP'1Wtic Statu. 303\nlooked like a merely mechanical reproduction; but it was observable\nthat, when re-hypnotised and asked what he had been doing, he did not\nsimply quote the words he had written, but said, \"Trying to make a\nlittle hymn--a little verse,\" which looks like memory of a real psychical\noperation. Again, the case of Garda are all 80rted strongly\nsuggests intelligent memory, if it does not actually prove it; for\nno such phrase had been used in the \"subject's\" hearing, nor had\nany suggestion of writing been made in connection with the cards-\nthe experiment having been undertaken for another purpose. It may\nbe hoped that repeated trials may yield further instances of these self-\noriginated remarks. There would be some advantage in their ex-\nclusively referring-as I think would prove to be the rule-to things\nconnected with previous times of hypnotic trance. For it is just the\nunlimited range of topics open to the ordinary non-hypnotic \"auto-\nmatist\" which often make his scripts uninstructive as to the degree\nof reminiscence and representation that may be going on in those\nmental strata which, it seems, we must unlearn the habit of calling\nunconscious. His secondary intelligence is prone,as Mr. Myers has said,\nto be a \"sermonising entity\"; and we want not sermons, but autobio-\ngraphy. Now the post-hypnotic intelligence evoked during hypnotic\ntrance, if akin to that exhibited in the trance itself, will rarely have\nspontaneity enough to sermonise; where it takes its own line, its\ntendency will be to run in old grooves; and this fact, combined with\nthe fact that the grooves of previous hypnotic experiences are com-\nparatively few and narrow, might, as time went on, afford exceptional\nopportunities for testing the coherence of secondary memory during\nnormal life.\nMeanwhile I have some further results, superior in interest to any\nof the preceding, as tending to show that the a.ctivities of these hidden\nstra~ may include higher psychical functions than mere random spurts\nof memory-processes of deliberate reckoning andre1lection which it is\nalmost impossible to conceive as having only a physiological existence.\nAdvantage was taken of the fact that the hypnotised\" subject\" could\nbe woke in an instant, by a clap on the shoulders and a loud call. Thus\nquestions could be put a.nd problems suggested to him, while in trance,\nantI all of a sudden there he was in his normal waking state, without a\nsecond's interval having been allowed for his hypnotic consciousness to\nwork out the answer. The questions and problems varied in difficulty.\nOne of the simplest was, \"What puts out fire 1\" This was addressed\nby S. to W-s, who was then instantly woke. Set to the planchette,\nhis hand at once wrote, Water. We may, perhaps, suppose that so\nobvious and direct an answer as this might have formed itself in his\nmind even in the fraction of a second; so tliat the writing might be\nexplained as the mere letting off of the spring that had been '\u00a5QUIld up\nDigitized by ~008Ie\n\f304 Peculia7\"ii'i~ of Certain Post-Hypnot\u00b7ic States. [April 23,\nbefore his condition was changed. The same could hardly be said of\nthe results which follow.\nW- s was told in the trance to add together all the digits from 1 to\n9, and was immediately woke. Set to planchette, his hand after some\nseconds produced the number 32. This is of course quite wt:ong, and\nimplies no calculation; but the guess is not a worse one than I find\nmany people give, if requested to give their impression-after a few\nseconds of reflection-of what the sum amounts to. The experiment\nwas now repeated, the direction to sum the digits being given,\nand the \"subject\" awakened on the instant. He was set to the\nplanchette, which at once began to move. As usual, I was careful\nnot to attempt to read while the writing was going on; but I became\naware that it was proceeding downwards on the paper, instead of\nfrom left to right; and thinking that the result of this would be\nan illegible scribble, I requested W- s to keep the movement, if he\ncould, in a left-to-right line. A certain difficulty seemed to ensue,\nand on looking at the paper, I found that it contained the digits\narranged thus ;-\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5 6\nthe position of the 5 and 6 being due to W--s's conscious interference\nwith the downward tendency of his hand. There had been the custom-\nary screen between his eyes and the paper, and he had no idea. what\nhad occurred. I now placed the instrument, with his hand upon it, on\na fresh sheet of paper of more convenient shape, expecting the sum to\nbe recommenced; but the writing continued, .\n7\n8\n9\n44\nThe actual sum of the nine digits is 45; but a person would not be\nlikely to arrive at so close an approximation who had not, in part at\nany rate, gone through the calculation. This was one of the few cases\nwhere the \"subject,\" on re-hypnotisation, had no recollection of what\nhe had written, or even of having written at all ; 80 that that important\ntest of psychical, as distinct from purely automatic, activity was here\nlacking. I regret that it did not occur to me to act on my\nknowledge of the different stages of hypnotic memory, and to try\nwhether the memory did not recur in the deeper stage (see my subse-\nquent paper). But it must be observed that the memory-test has\nizedbyGoogle\n\f1887.] Peculiarities of Oertain Post-Hypnotic States. 305\npositive, but not negative validity; its SUCceBB may amount to a\nproof that psychical activity was present, but its failure is no sufficient\nproof of the contrary.\nW-s was now told to multiply 324 by 12, and at once\nawakened. The planchette produced the sum as follows :-\n324\n12\n4008\nThis result, though incorrect, would be correct if the firstnumber was\n3S4. Anyone is liable to such a mistake as this; so th\"t here again there\nis reason to suppose a genuine proceaa of reckoning; but unfortunately\ntime failed us to apply the memory-test after this experiment. Another\nday, W__ was told to add together 5, 6, 8, 9, and had just had time to\nsay 5, as though he were going to repeat the figures, when he was woke\nin the fraction of a second with the word on his lips. The planchette\nimmediately produced 28 (right). He was told to add together I, 2, 5,\n7,8, and instantly awakened. The planchette wrote 23 (right).\nThe experiment in the summation of the nine digits being repeated\nwith P--ll, the first result was 39; the second 45 (right). Re-hyp-\nnotiaed and asked by S. what he had been writing, he said, \"You told\nme to add the figures 1-9,-45.\" \"Did you write it 1\" \"Yes, I wrote\nit down.\" \"When did you add them'\" \" When you told me. I think\nthat's right.\" He added the figures up again, half audibly, and ended\nby saying, \"45; right.\" This addition occupied many more seconds than\nthe interval between the original order and the waking previous to\nwriting. He was told to add together 3, 4, 6, 7, and was woke with-\nout a. second's pause. The writing that appeared was 20 (right). Re-\nhypnotised and questioned, he said he had written 20.\nSimilar experiments with S-t succeeded equally. The first\nresult obtained was exceptional. He was told to add together\n3, 4, 7, 8, 9, and was instantly roused with a clap and call. The\ncorrect answer, 31, was apoke1&, immediately after the rousing, and\nwithin three seconds of the conclusion of the order; but he clearly had\nnot been brought to a normal waking state. In the subsequent triala\ncomplete waking, the instant after the order, was ensured by more\nvigorous means. He was told to add together 4, 7, 8, 11, 12, and was\nwoke on the instant; the written result was 42 (right). He was told\nto add together 2, 7, 9, 12, 13, and was woke on the instaut; the wri.ten\nresult was 43 (right). He was told to multiply 683 by 7, and was\nwoke on the instant. He was kept talking, while his hand wrote 468l.\nOn re-hypnotisation, he remembered writing this, but said he believed it\nwas wrong-the 6 should be 7. He was told to multiply 534 by 3, and was\nwoke on the instant; the result, written with extraordinary ranid~A~nde\nDigitized by'\\J~61\u20ac ..\n\f306 Pecul:ia1-ities 01 Certain Post-Hypnotic States. [April 23.\nconcluded within three seconds ofthe conclusion of the order, was 1602\n(right). Theae results are the more noticeable in that S-t is not by\nany means a ready reckoner. I found, for instance, that in the norma.!\nstate it took him about ten seconds to do each of the two last\naddition sums. On S-t, alone ofthe \"subjects,\" the writing hAd some-\ntimes the effect of re-inducing a trance condition; and in one of the SUBl-\neases the mere sense of having the sum to do seemed to have the same\neffect. He was told to multiply 358 by 9, and was instantly woke and\nmade to read aloud, whieh he did excellently for some time ; but on my\ntaking the book away, he fell into trance and in that state wrote 3222\n(right).\nThe following trials were of a somewhat similar type. P--ll was\ntold to write the alphabet, beginning at the 16th letter. Awakenedon\nthe instant, he wrote STU V W X Y Z. Here was a failure; but\nthe interest of the experiment appeared on re-hypnotiaation of the\n\"subject,\" when he seemed clearly to remember the mental effor' to\ndiscover the right letter, and excused his mistake by saying that\" that\nimage was there again\" (see p. 319). He was told to add up the letters\nin the two lines, \"How doth the little busy bee Improve each shining\nhour,\" and was woke in about five seconds. The writing produced was\n43, which is approximately correct, the real total being 45. Another\nday, S-t was asked how many times the letter e occurs in the same\ntwo lines, and was woke on the instant. The figure 6 (right) was\nproduced; and on re-hypnotiaation he remembered having written it.\nMost people, I think, would require as many &8 10 seconds to arrive\nat the correct answer; so that it seems almost certain that the\ncalculation was performed after the waking.\nAnother form of trial was the writing of the letters of words and\nphrases in reverse order--a. process which, for an unpr&etised person.\nundoubtedly requires some amount of conscious reflection. W--s\nhaving been told to write \"elephant\" backwards, and instantly woke,\nthe planchette produced Tneplie. This is a nearer approximation than\nat first sight appears, since his hypnotic idea of the real spelling of the\nword proved to be \" eliphent \"; 80 that the planchette's only mistakes\nwere the I and i unreversed, and the h omitted. He was told to write\nbackwards \"I bake good fancy bread,\" and was instantly woke. The\nplanchette moved to the right of the paper, and wrote\nI bake god Janky 1 bred\nfrom right to left, beginning with the last letter. Told to write\n\"Brighton\" backwards, and instantly woke, he produced nothgirB\n(right). P--ll was told to write \"millinery\" backwards, and was\n1 The letter y is uncertain. G I\nDigitized by oog e\n\f1887.] Peculiarities of Certain P08t-Hypnotic States. 307\ninstantly woke: the result was gnirellim. Re-hypnotised and asked\nwhat he had written, he said cc millering,\" but added, cc gni is wrong\n-ing is wrong.\" He was told to write cc To-morrow is Sunday\" back-\nwards, and was instantly woke; the result was the phrase correctly\nwritten from right to lef~ beginning with the last letter. Similar\ntrials were made with S--~ with the word \"Brighton,\" and the\nsentence\" It has just been raining.\" Each was correctly produced\nby the planchette, from left to righ~ and beginning with the last\nletter.\nSuch trials might be indefinitely extended with \"subjeots\" who, in\nthe normal state, were more capable than mine of complex mental\noperations. I found myself limited to very simple tests, and could not,\nfor instance, ask any questions relating to matters of historical or\nscientific information. I did, however, make some attempts to obtain\nanswers to questions of a more general kind, admitting of a choice, with\nresults which as far as they went were completely successful. Thus,\nP--ll was told to write the names of three places beginning with r...,\nand was instantly woke; the planchette wrote\nL6W68, Lamcalion, LewiBhann,\nthe second name being interpreted as Lancaster when he was re-\nhypnotised. A similar trial with the letter H produced HMti'Tl{!8,\nHamsted, HQ\/fU)'I}6f'; trial with the letter T, TO'I'fJ'I'B, TOf\"I\"ington, Totting-\nham C(Y1't. During the first of these experiments he was engrossed,\nduring the writing, with the hallucination of a wild ca~l which, on\nre-hypnotisation, he said he \" hadn't liked the looks of - it looked half-\nstarved.\" While writing the T names, he was roaring with laughter\nthe whole time at the hallucinatory spectacle of a pantomime, and\ndescribing the doings of the clown. On April 18th, a wider field of\nchoice was given him, in the direction to write down anything that had\nhappened in Brighton during the past year, after which he was instantly\nwoke. St't to the planchette, he read aloud a description of a play from\na newspaper; and meanwhile his hand wrote\n.A H(Y1'8e Rum away last EMter Monday along the Ki'Tl{! Road.\nThis was a fac~ and had caused considerable excitement. Again,\nhe was told to write down the earliest thing he could remember, and\n'was instantly woke. He was made to count backwards from a hundred,\nwhich he did slowly and with stumbles; meanwhile his hand wrote,\nOne day when I whaa goi'Tl{! to achool I whaa goi'Tl{! up the 8treet I\npick up a 8hilli'Tl{! and I gave it to mother and 8he was please with it.\n1 With these\" subjects,\" a hallucination canalways be imposed for a short\nperiod after waking,though otherwise they are to all appearance in a completely\nnormal state. Digitized by ~Or81e\n\f308 Peculiaritie8 of Certain P08t-Hypnotic States. [April 23,\nIt turned out that this was a real event which had happened when he\nwas about five years old. Still earlier memories were similarly evoked.\nWhen I had tM Bcarlet jtlVer Borne woman brought me in Borne bulh-\neyu on a piece of paper.\nOne day wMn I whaa rocking tM cradle with my little brotMr\nCharley I turn tM cradle over.\nThis last occurrence took place when he was about three; he over-\nturned the cradle in a passion at the baby's peevishness. Such experi-\nments cannot be too often repeated, with a view to obtaining the record\nof sOmething unremembered in the normal state---as in the case of\nAdrienne (p. 241).\nThe direction to \"draw what he liked\" produced rough sketches\nwhich, on re-hypnotisation, he interpreted as a rifleman, a box, an\negg-cup, a rifle, another rifleman, a pigeon-and which were quite\nrecognisable; his left hand meanwhile was slowly sorting a pack of\ncards into suits. The direction to \"write what he liked \" elicited a\ncommon-place note to his sweetheart.\nHaving regard to the subsequent hypnotic memory, I think that\neven the above simple and often imperfect writings afford an extremely\nstrong presumption of an intelligent and not merely mechanical origin.\nBut the next set of results are perhaps still more conclusive, as they\ndefinitely exclude the hypothesis of a cerebral registration of the correct\nanswer, arrived at by a preternaturally quick calculation or reminis-\ncence in the instant between the comprehension of the order and the\nawakening to normal consciousness. The experiments, like some of\nthose in \u00a7 IlL, involved the reckoning of time; but their point lay\nin the fact that the reckoning was shown, not merely, as before, by the\nexecution of an order at approximately the right moment, but by\nwriting produced during the period of waiting, at Borne IJ'IUidenly-selected\nmoment, which the\" subject\" could not foresee when the process began\n-so that there could be no question of the \"setting of the organism\"\nfor a certain time ahead. And a further novel point was the proof\nafforded, in some cases, that the order itself was remembered and\nrealised by the secondary consciousness during the period throughout\nwhich the dominant primary consciousness was wholly without know-\nledge of it.\nW- s was hypnotised, and told that in 6 minutes he was to blow\na candle out, and that he would be required, at some time before then,\nto write the number of minutes that had passed, and the number that\nhad still to elapse. He was woke, laughed and talked as usual, and of\ncourse knew nothing of the order. In about 31 minutes, h.\nwas set down to the planchette, which wrote\n41-1 more.\nDigi\n\f1887.] Peculiarities of Oertain Post-Hypnotic States. 309\nAbout a minute passed, and then I requested s. to re-hypnotise him;\nbutjust as his eyes were beginning to close, he raised himself, and blew\nout the candle, saying, \"It's beginning to smell.\" Hypnotised and\nquestioned, he remembered all that he had done; and when it was\npointed out to him that 4i and 1 do not make 6, he explained the\ndiscrepancy by saying, \"It took half a minute for you to tell me; I\nreckoned from the end of your telling me.\" This, of course, does not\nexpll\\in his reckoning the time before he wrote as a minute longer than\nit was; but that is not a larger error than anyone of us might commit\nin computing such a period.\nOn March 19th, he was told in the trance that, when he came\nnext, he was to poke the fire 6 minutes after his arrival, and that\nwhen he wrote he was to record the number of minutes that had run,\nand that remained to run. On March 21st he arrived at 6-57i, and I\nset him down to the planchette in about a minute. The writing, which\nit took about a minute to produce, was\n2-3i more.\nAt 7.3 he said he wanted to poke the fire, and got up and did BO, in\nspite of my dissuasion. In the course of re-hypnotisation, he was\nasked what he had been doing, and replied, \"I had my hand on that\nthing,\" but he could not say what had been written. From former\nexperience I knew that he was not yet completely entranced, as he was\nable to hear and answer me, as well as S. After a few more passes,\nwhen he was deaf to my voice, the question was repeated, and he at\nonce replied, \" Two-three and a-half more.\" \" What did that meant \"\n.. Two minutes-three and a-half more, poke the fire.\"\nOn March 21st, he was told that on the morrow, a quarter of\nan hour after his arrival, he was to pull up the blind and look out of the\nwindow. He arrived next evening at 7.10, and was BOon set to the\nplanchette; but as the instrument did not move he was hypnotised,\ntold that I wanted to know how the time was going, and immediately\nawakened. The writing\n7 minutes and 8 more\nwas now produced. The process began at just 7.17, so that at that\nmoment the reckoning was exactly right; but, owing to a wheel coming\noft' the instrument and having to be replaced, the writing itself was\nspread over four minutes.\nThe same I.subject\" was told on March 23rd that, a quarter of\nan hour after his next arrival, he was to open and shut the door\nof the room, and to note the course of time, as usual. The next evening\nhe arrived at7.61. He was set to the planchette at 7.19. The writing,\nproduced at once, was 13 min. and 2 more. At 7.22 he rose, walked\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f310 Peculiarities of Oertain Post-HY'JYMtic Statu. [April 23,\nacross the room, opened and shut the door, and returned to his seat.\nHere the reckoning was not more than half a minute out.\nOn March 25th, the order was to put his hat on and take it oft'\nagain 20 mintU88 after his next arrival, and to write as usual. Next\nday hearrived at 7.13. After some experiments of a different sort, he\nwas set to the pla.nchette, and as it did not move, he was hypnotised,\ntold rapidly to \"write as be had been directed,\" and instantly awakened,\nwith the words\" What last night'\" on his lips. This was at 7.31.\nThe instrument at once wrote,\n18 mmutu gons Ii more.\nAt 7.35, he walked to where his hat lay, put it on, and took it oft' again.\nRe-hypnotiaed, and reminded that 18 and Ii do not make 20, he said\nthat he had allowed half a minute for the writing. It had occupied,\nI think, leas than a minute; so that the reckoning was remarkably\ncorrect.\nAnother time, W--s was told at 7.49 p.m., that he was to put on\nhis hat in 10 minutes, and that I might want to know, meanwhile,\nhow the time was paaaing. He was then woke, and was set to the\nplanchette at 7.50. The writing produced was,\n1 min--7* more.\nThe proceaa was exceptionally slow and difficult, and occupied 2* minutes.\nHad it been produced rather more quickly, the second part of this\nstatement, as well as the first, might have been exactly right; and on\nseveral occasions it was observabll\\ that the\" subject .. did not seem\nproperly to realise the length of the time occupied in the actual writing.\nAt 8 o'clock W--s was obliged to go; but before leaving the room,\nhe took up his hat, looked at it a little oddly, put it on, and then\nquickly took it oft' again, saying, \" Needn't put that on up here, need I '\/\"\nThere was a point in this case which has a special bearing on that\nsegregation of conacioUBneaa which all the experiments illustrate; namely,\nthe difficulty' which the \"subject\" found, when re-hypnotiaed, in\ndescribing what he had written (cJ. p.298). In no case was the writing\nshown to him, but he always spoke as if he actually saw it; and in\nthis instance, on being asked what it was, he said at first that he could\nnot make it out. Urged to try, he went on, with breaks and just as a\npuzzled person would, \"One min- don't understand what the next\nletter is. Oh, seven I Why two has got on the other line-Seven\nand a-half more.\" No words could have agreed better with the true\naspect of the script. Now this leads one to observe how the\nperception of the actual writing, the ground which in a way is common\nto both lIel1J68-as for brevity they may be called-is meted out between\nthe two. Each seems to regard exactly what the other does not.

This self is alive simply to the mechanical part of\nthe writing.process, and is conscious of distinct and sometimes very\ndisagreeable physical sensations accompanying it. The secondary self,\non the other hand, never showed that the procus of writing as such,\nhad had for it any interest, or roused in it any special sensations; and,\nas I have said, it seemed unaware of the time that the process occupied.\nIts whole interest was in the content-the sense of what was written\nand in the appearance of the writing (conjured up by it with such\nsingular distinctness) so far as that affected legibility. In other\nwords, the relation of the primary self to the writing was that of a\nchild whose hand a teacher guides painfully over pot-hooks and\nhangers; that of the secondary self was that of an author who some-\ntimes has to regret his own clumsy penmanship.\nThe next experiment, though partially unsuccessful, is not devoid\nof interest. P--ll was told that in 10 minutes he was to draw aside\nthe blind and look out of the window, and that he was to record how\nthe time was going, as usual; and was then woke. He was set to the\nplanchette in about 3 minutes, but nothing followed; he remarked,\n\" My right hand feels just like my left.\" (It will be remembered that\nthis\" subject\" suffered greatly in the hand and arm during the process\nof writing.) He was re-hypnotiaed, and S. said, \"Why did you not\nwrite just now1\"\nP--LL. \"Somebody disturbed me. They looked over my shoulder\nand made me angry. I don't want everybody to know what I write.\"\n(This may very probably have been a reminiscence of an imaginary\nterror on a previous occasion; see p. 319.)\nS. \"What were you going to write 1\"\nP--LL. II I was going to write 3 minutes had passed since you\ntold me to look out of the window, and I was going to write '7 minutes'\nafterwards.\"\nThe time-reckoning, it will be seen, was correct. But the principal\npoint to note is the sense of disturbance, with the complete unawareness\nof it of the normal self. We may regard such immunity as the converse\nof those painful sensations which used not only to accompany but to\nprecede the writing on other occasions when the secondary self appears\nto have worked with comfort and freedom.\nThe value of P--ll for these experiments was diminished by the\nfact that he is by nature a bad reckoner of time. For instance, one\nday when he had arrived about five minutes before I entered the room,\nbe said he thought he had been waiting a quarter of an hour. Still,\nconsidering how much scope there was for going wrong if the secondary\nintelligence were merely guessing without reckoning, I think that the\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f312 Pecruliaritie8 0\/ Certain Post-Hypnotic States. [April 23,\nfollowing instances are significant. On April 20th he was told that\nhalf....n-hour after his next arrival he was to wind up a ball of string,\nand to let me know how the time was going. He arrived next evening\nat 8.30, and was set to the planchette at 8.43. He wrote,\n13 mineU has paB8ed and 17 more minett8 to paB8.\nSome more experiments followed, and it so happened that at 9, the\nexact time \",hen the fulfilment was due, he was in the trance. He\nsuddenly said, \"Oh !\" as if recollecting something, but did not move;1\nhe was then woke, and at 9.2 he walked across the room to where some\nstring was lying, and wound it up. On April 18th an exact.ly similar\norder was given, except that the thing to be done was to take off his\ncoat. He arrived at 9.10 on April 20th, and was set to the planchette\nat 9.U, and while reading a newspaper aloud with intelligence and\ncomplete comprehension, he wrotl',\n5 mineU has pall88d 25 minuett 11488 got, paBW and then I sha8 e~\nof my coat.\nThe order, however, was fulfilled at 9.21, almost immediately after\nthe conclusion of the writing. Again, he was told at 9.81 p.m., to poke\nthe fire in 10 minutes. He was woke, and at 9.12 was set to the\nplanchette. The writing began at once, and ran,\nThree minuetta has paB8ed and notCI [7] there \" 7 more minuett8 has\ngot, to passed and eTum I ,hall poke ehe fire.\nThe writing was unusually slow, occupying five minutes, so that\nthough it began by being nearly correct, it became le88 so as it went on.\nHe was then re-hypnotised, and other experiments were made.\nWhen woke he went to his former seat, and after looking uncom-\nfortably at the fire for some time, said to me, \" You don't mind\nmy poking the fire, do you, sir 7\"-and poked it. This was some time\nafter the expiration of the 10 minutes; but possibly the intermediate\nhypnotisation had had a confusing effect. On March 21st the same\n\" subject\" was told, in the trance, that he was to put on his hat a\nquarter of an hour after his next arrival. He was set to the planchette\nabout 7 minutes after his arri...al next day, but the writing did not\nbegin till he had been hypnotised, and the idea of writing suggested to\nhim.

The act (as usual with P--ll) was completely\nforgotten within two minutes of its performance.\nThe following result, obtained with my third\" subject,\" S-t.\nafforded a remarkably clear proof of the continuity of the reckoning.\nHe was told, in the trance, that he was to look out of the window\n7 minutes after waking; and that he was to write how the time was\ngoing. He was then woke. This was at 7.34l p.m. I set him to the\nplanchette, and the writing began at 7.361. I did not watch the\nprocess; but where I stood, holding the screen in front of his eyes, I\nwas so close to his arm and hand that I could not help becoming aware\nthat writing was being produced at distinct intervals. I remarked\naloud that he was going by fits and starts, and seemed to have to pause\nto get up steam. Immediately on the conclusion of the writing, which\nwas at 7.40, he got up, drew a.aide the blind, and looked out. Examining\nthe paper, I found\n25 34 43 62 61 7.\nClearly he had aimed at recording,at each minute from the time when\nhe began, the number that had passed and the number that remained.\nHis first estimate was only 10 seconds wrong; but he somewhat\nabbreviated his subsequent minutes, so that the 5 were condensed\ninto 31. .\n.Again, he was told on March 27th that he was to do a particular\nthing half-an-hour after his next a.rri~al, and to let me know as to the\ntime. He came next on April ith, at 8.45, and before long was put to\nthe instrument; but as no writing occurred, he was hypnotised and\nasked if there was not something he was to do. He at once repeated\nthe order-wrongly as regards the act commanded; but on being\nwoke, at 8.59, his hand at once produced 14-16, which was an exact\nstatement of the number of minutes elapsed and still to elapse.\nAnother day he was told at 5.401 p.m. to poke the fire in 20\nminutes, and to let me know how the time was going, and was then\nwoke.

How far have\nthe above experiments carried us , We have noted in them the\ndivision of interest, and of the broader currents of attention, and\nhow the normal self was throughout unaware of the written exhi-\nbitions of secondary intelligence. But we have had no proof that the\nsecondary intelligence was to the same extent excluded from normal\nperception-in other words, that it would have been unable to exhibit\nknowledge of something that struck the\" subject's\" senses, or occupied\nhis mind, while the writing was going on. The contrary, I think, is\nwhat we should expect: we should expect to find that the topics which\nthe writing self could write about coalesced in part with the topics\nwhich the talking self could talk about. I have elsewhere suggested,\na propos of the now well-known Newnham case, that segregated con-\nscious states, when BimultaneotU, may be strictly comparable to the\nlJUCC688ive states in cases of so-called \"double-consciousness.\" 1 And since\nin double consciousness the abnormal self remembers what the nonnal self\nhas known and felt, but not 'Dice versd \" and since in hypnotism, which\nreaHy exhibits \"double consciousness\" on a amaH scale, the hypnotised\n\" subject\" remembers normal life, but on waking forgets hypnoti.. life ;\n80 in these post-hypnotic trials it would not seem surprising if the\nsecondary self had access to normal experiences-in the sense that\nintelligent perception of these was evinced behind the back, so to speak,\nof the normal self-though the normal self has no access to the special\ngoing. After two n:ore minutes he was woke; and the planchette then pro\u00b7\nduced, .\nTwentll-fiw minutu pall sewn.\nIt was really two or three minutes later. This approximation formed a\nstriking contrast to tht\" normal blankness; for on waking he never had\nthe slightest idea how long his trance had lasted, and at the end of aD\nhour's experiments was always surprised at being told that it was time for\nhim to go-often remarking that he seemed to have been only two or three\nminutes in the room. I may add that he had no watch, and that there was\nno clock in the room, or within hearing; but this is unimportant, as he\nshowed the usual ignorance both of what had been said to him and of what\nhe had written. Similarly P-ll, though not to be relied on, would some-\ntimes prove to have reckoned with nearly complete correctness periods of half\nan hour or three.quarters of an hour, which had been cut into bits by\ninterludes of trance.\n1 PlIanta&m8 01 the Living, VoL I., p.69, 70; and see Mr. Myers' remarb\nabove, p. 256\u00b77.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f1887.] PecuJ,iaritieB of Certain Post-Hypnotic States. 315\nsecondary experiences. And that such is indeed the case there is\nexperimental evidence to show.1\nThe simplest cases are those where the reckoning of auditory signals\nis recorded by the planchette. Thus P--ll was told, in the trance,\nthat, when I coughed for the third time, it would begin to rain. He was\nwoke, his hand was placed on the planchette, and I gave three coughs at\nintervals. There was no movement till the third cough, when the words\nWhen Jir. G'WN'l6'!I cough jOlf\" third tim\nwere at once produced. At this point the writing seemed to labour,\nand then ceased. I found that the\" subject's\" arm had become quite\nrigid, and that he could not raise it-an e1l'ect which soon passed 011'.\nThis concluded his first day's experience of tile planchette, which greatly\nimpressed him. He Said earnestly, \"That is a wonderful thing! Why,\nit takes my hand along without my being able to stop it!

I asked if he had\nnoticed my coughing,. and he said, \"No, sir;\" but this, of course\nshowed no more than he had heard without attending. He was now\nhypnotised, told that I wanted to know how often I had coughed, and\nA.t once woke. The writing recommenced,\n4 times he 1148 cough and 2 times mOIf\"ll he 1148 to cough.\nI coughed twice more, and he went to the window, drew aside the\nblind, and looked out. Two minutes afterwards I asked him what sort\nof a night it was.

He was woke, set to the planchette, and read a newspaper\naloud. Soon after his hand began to write, I knocked the poker down\nin the fender. The writing was,\n3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 tM Poker FeU do\"\", in Fmdw.\nHe was told to write down the alphabet, omitting every other\nletter, and also anything startling that occurred.

Thus, while P--ll's hand was on the\nplanchette, and he was counting aloud the number of times 1 clapped\nmy hands, S. asked him successively: \"What day of the week is it t\"\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f1887.] Peculiatrities of Certain Post-Hypnotic States. 317\n\" How many sisters have you'\" \"~ow many brothers have you'\"\n\" When did you beginwork this morning'\" The writing produced was,\nThwrsday 3 5 7 o'clock.\nAsked immediately afterwards, he said he did not thiBk that S. had\nbeen speaking, unless perhaps he had BpIiIken to me (see p. 320).\nSimilarly, having been told to write the numbers from 100 backwards,\nwith omission of every other number, then woke, and impressed with\nthe hallucination of the soldier, he was asked, \" What day is to-morrow '\"\n\" What is the opposite of black'\" \" What is\" large pistol called 1\"\n\"What does he put in his pistol to make it go off' \"-and wrote,\n100 98 6 4 Friday White Rifle Powder.\nMore interesting, though much rarer of attainment, are the\neases where the percept which enters into the secondary self's\nreckonings and writings is not one that has been in any way fore-\nordained for that purpose. For example, S-t was told, .in the trance,\nto add together 3,5,8, 13, 14, and was instantaneously woke, and his\nhand laid on the planchette. I then at once told him to add together\n2, 7, 9, 10, 13. After a little reflection, he .t&id 41, which was right;\nand his hand wrote 45, which was wrong, the right answer to the first\nsum being 43. He was re-hypnotised, and asked what he had written;\nhe said 45. Asked what that meant, he said it was the sum of f,\n7, 9, 13, 14. This sum is correct; and it is difficult to avoid the con-\nclusion that the three first digits which I mentioned to him after his\nawaking got incorporated into his calculation, displacing the first three\nof the previous list. The next experiment contained a fainter indication\nto the same effect. He was told, in the trance, to add together 4, 7, 11,\n12, 13,and was instantly woke. His hand wrote 49-again 2 out. But\nwhen re-hypnotised, and asked what numbers he had added, he said f,\n9, 11, 13, 14-which would make his result correct; again introducing\nthe 2, 9, which he had never heard except in the normal state.\nAgain, a hallucination which was occupying the \" subject's\"\nattention occasionally forced its way quite irrelevantly into the writing.\nP--ll was told to write the numbers backwards from 100, was woke,\nand was once more impressed with the idea of the soldier, who was\nabout to fire at him.

It would alone strongly suggest that the mind had been in\nsome degree engaged with something else, and that there had been a\nsort of struggle between the two; and this is exactly what we can\nreadily suppose that the presence of the unsolved problem in the\nsecondary consciousness may have caused. But it is also a strong in.\ndication that the forgotten things remained outside the scope of the\nsecondary intelligence. For the oblivion which the segregation of the\ntwo streams of consciousness partially explains, would seem wholly un\u00b7\naccountable if the forgotten things had had a place in both streams.\nThe next case is still more significant in this sense. P--ll was\ntold several times, \" It has left oft' snowing\"; and then, when woke\nand set to the planchette, he was made to read aloud. The writing\nwhich appeared was,\nIt has lfift m-\nand while this was proceeding, the reading was bad and stumbling.\nWhen the writing stopped, the reading became appreciably more correct\nand fluent. Re-hypnotisation aft'orded a glimpse of the condition in\nwhich the secondary intelligence had found itself. Asked what he had\nbeen doing, the\" subject\" replied, \"Trying to write 'It has left oft'\nsnowing.''' Asked if he had been reading, he said, \"Reading !

The experiment was repeated.\nThe \"subject\" was told, \"It has begun snowing again.\" The writing\nwas now an almost illegible scrawl of\nIt begun IJ'1I.OW'i.ng.\nMeanwhile he was reading about Humpty.Dumpty, slowly and with\nomission of words, but with clear comprehension and decided amuse-\nment.

[April 23,\nway that he was disturbed in writing; as to which I can\nonly suppose that the sense of strain, involved in the ineffectual\nattempt to concentrate attention on the writing, developed into\na sort of hallucination, just as in sleep discomfort of various sorts\ndevelops into dream. Here, then, was a remarkable result. Not only\nwas the normal self, as usual, quite alert, and ita interest in\nHumpty Dumpty quite unalloyed by the dark fancies of its hidden\nfellow; and not only on re-hypnotisation was there no memory of\nthe manner in which the normal self had been employed; but there was\na distinct memory of something else. An experience which must have\nbelonged to the secondary self (since the primary had no knowledge of\nit) is shown to have had a very substantive reality, and actually\nprevails over a decidedly vivid piece of normal life on the plane of su~\nquent memory. The result seems a pretty clear proof that the states\nwere mutuallyexclusive in this instance; and renders it probable that they\nmay be so in any instance where the available stock of attention (which\nthere is no reason to believe to be increased by the segregation of\nstates) is completely used, and where the subjects which engage the\ntwo lines of attention are themselves sufficiently distinguished. Thia\nwas clearly not the case in the previous examples where the secondary\nconsciousness was set to mark certain sounds which were to meet the\nnormal ear, and where an effort was made to get two similar bits of\narithmetic done at the same time. As it happens, in the case just\ndescribed the available stock of attention fell short; the double drain\nWBB too much, and neither the primary nor the secondary intelligence\nwas able to perform its task perfectly when the other was in activity;\nwhile the strain and disturbance introduced a new and confusing\nelement. In other cases, the one or the other more or less broke down ;\napart from actual mistakes in writing or in reading,} we have seen the\nsecondary self producing incoherent phrases; and on several occasions\nwhen it was well to the fore, and gave the correct answers to spoken\nquestions in correct form, the primary self, interrogated immediately\nafterwards, appeared not to have heard these questions, even as\nsound, and certainly had not understood them. But if my surmise be\n1 It was curious to observe how the act of writing sometimes seemed to\naffect P-U's power of articulation; the difficulty seemed to be of a\ndistinctly physical sort, and he himself several times remarked that it seemed\nto .. draw\" the right side of his mouth, without affecting his comprehension of\nwhat he read. It seems just posllible that this may be connected with the\nproximity of the cerebral centres of speech and of movement of the right arm\n(see Le MagmtiBme Animal, by MM. Binet and FtSrtS, p. 250). At. the same time\nthe difficulty undoubtedly seemed to be less when the acta accomplished were\nof a semi\u00b7mechanico.l kind; as when he had to write the numbers from 100\nbackwards, and simultaneously count the numbers from 1 forwards, and\n1Ike _..:I.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f1887.] Peculiarities of Certain Post-Hypnotic States. 321\nright, we might expect, by varying the trials, to hit at last on cases\nwhere two mental tasks, both of them requiring IOm8 but neither of\nthem very muck attention, were simultaneously carried out, without\neither of them interfering with the performance of the other, and\nleaving memories which should be mutually exclusive, and ascertainable\nonly in the normal and the hypnotic states respectively.1\nThe following seem to be examples of the kind. P--ll was told\nto count the number of times the letter 0 occurs in the lines, .. Jenny,\nmy own true loved one, Wait till the clouds roll by,\" and was instantly\nwoke. His hand being laid on the planchette, he was made to read\na. newspaper aloud, which he did excellently. Meanwhile 5 0 was\nwritten. On re-hypnotisation, he said that he had written the answer\nto what he had been asked, but he totally denied having been reading,\ncould not recall anything about a newspaper, and did not even\nremember that anything had been held in front of him, though\nadmitting that he was unable to see what he was writing. Similarly\nio the case described above (p. 307), where he wrote about the horse\nrunning away on Easter Monday, he was reading with tolerable\nfluency from a newspaper during the whole time of the writing, and\nstood examination on the passage; but on re-hypnotisation he did not\nremember to have been reading, though he did recall \"that his mouth\nwent to and fro as if he was eating.\" It is worth adding that on\noccasions where no hypnotic suggestion had been made about giving\nwritten answers to S.'s remarks, and where the appointed task,whatever\nit was, was not performed by the writing self, S.'s spoken appeals--as,\n\"Now what does that come to' \"or \"Now we want you to tell us-\nyou know what\"-never produced any effect; which looked as if the\nsecondary intelligence was unaware of them.\nThere is one other experiment, of special interest as I think, to which\nI must again refer in this connection-the one with W- 8 (p. 299),\n1 I must again point out that the mutual exclusiveness of memory, though\nhighly demonstrative, when it occurs, of the mutual exclusiveness of the\nremembered states, would not be neceeaarily involved therein; for we have no\nright to expect the subsequent hypnotic memory to confineitee1f to .. secondary\"\nexperienC88. At the same time the cases which follow in the text do seem to\nreveal a CI086r connection of the subsequent hypnotic memory with the\nsecondary than with the primary experiences. It is worth noting here that the\nfailure on re-hypnotisation to remember the primary experieaces was never\nobserved in eases where the secondary task had been easy, involving no reckon-\ning or reftection. Thus in the case (p. 312) where P-ll wrote about the time,\n5 millett has ]HI886d, &c., he was reading aloud from a newspaper about a.\nshipwreck, and on re-hypnotisation remembered both tIte act of reading, and the\ncontents of the pasaage. In the case of the note to his sweetheart, he was alao\nreadiJlg aloud, and perfectly remembered the passage when re-hypnotised. This\nwould accord with the rule, if we were cynical enough to suppose that ~e com-\nl\nposition of such missives had become to some extent mechanicaligitized by l::.oog e\n\f322 Peculiarities of Oertain Post-Hypnotic States. [April 23,\nwhere the words CMa.. are all BOrled were produced by the planchette.\nThe conditions of attention were here exceptional; for the primary or\nostensible self, instead of being normal as in most of the planchette\nexperiments, was here under the influence of hyprwW: hallucination.\nNow, a hypnotic hallucination is peculiar in combining two character-\nistics-it is extremely absorbing, in the sense that it carries the\n\" subject's\" mind along a very distinct and narrow channel; while at\nthe same time it involves no reflection nor reckoning, and so does not\ndemand any large amount of mental activity. It seems, then, exactly\nadapted to allow scope for a parallel but wholly dissociated piece of\nmentation, ifmutually exclusive mental states be a possibility in nature ;\nand such a piece of mentation I concluded that it was which produced\nthe spontaneous written statement about the cards. But it will be\nremembered that the \"subject's\" expressed intention was to write\n&lWMtking else, and he believed afterwards-even while the actual\nword CMd& was before his eyes-that he had written something else.\nIt surely, then, seems a reasonable conclusion that, had the writing\nintelligence embraced the experience of this impulse to produce a\ndifferent script, tlUll. is what it would have produced, instead of\noriginating an unsolicited remark of its own. The following case with\nP--ll points in the same direction. He was told to write down the\nnames of three places beginning with H, and then was instantly woke,\nand told that he was to write a letter to me, and that the messenger\nwas standing there, waiting for it and bothering him. The hallucina-\ntion took complete effect, and he talked to the messenger all the time\nhe was writing; but the words produced were not a letter, but simply\nHa&ting& Hamsteti Hanover.1\nWith these results it is instructive to compare the somewhat similar\ncase of Madame B. (p. 249). That experiment also took place during\nhypnotic trance; but a leBa extreme m6ana than hallucination being\nemployed to engross the prima.ry intelligence, and keep it, so to speak,\nout of view of the secondary, the segregation sooms to have been less\ncomplete. For in the subsequent hypnotic condition, the \"subject,\"\nrecalling her secondary experiences, remembered that\" the other one\nwas talking\"; and one can hardly help regarding this as a true\n\" secondary\" memory: the memory of the \"primary\" experience-of\n1 In other cases, however, as wo have Been, P-U'a writing did show\nknowledge of a hallucinatory idea impreaaed after his waking.

I suspect, therefore, that if appealed to in the course of the\nexperiment, Madame B. would have been able \"automatically\" to\nshow knowledge of what her conversing self was doing.\nThe hint in W-s's case is, at any rate, one that is worth following\nup. We have for some time been familiar with hypnotism, in general, as\na means of loosening the connections of the mental machinery, and giving\nindependent play to this and that part of it. On that ground what we\nexamine is the hypnotic state itself; we study its phenomena directly\nfor what they are and what they teach. Hypnotism assumes a wholly\nnew significance when it leads (as in this paper and the preceding\none by Mr. Myers we have seen it do) to results beyrmd itseif-\nwhen it appears as the ready means for establishing a secondary\ntrain of consciousness, to which when established (as was pointed out\nabove) there is no ground for attributing any special hypnotic\ncharacter. And it would be a yet further development if in a\nparticular hypnotic phenomenon, such as induced hallucination, we\nfound the means for straining such secondary consciousness free from\na.ny association with the ostensible \"self,\" and assuring to it a\nperfectly independent dow. It would be a short-sighted yiew which\nshould see in such refinements as this the mere curiosities of psychical\nchemistry. In the new psychology, the line between the normal and\nabnormal has become so shadowy that not the smallest or rarest\nabnormal phenomenon can be safely neglected, by those who aim at the\nfullest possible realisation of human nature and development.

For here, at any rate, the\nsecondary intelligence was the sane, or, as we may, the normal self.\nIf we find it humiliating to our sense of human dignity to see a fellow-\ncreature the helpless puppet of suggested del~sions, it is at least some-\nthing to discover that reason still reigns in a part of his being-that\nhe is still capable of evolving sense and truth, even though from a\nconsciousness so \"inner\" that special appliances are needed to bring\nit to the surface.\nDigitized by Coogle\nv 9.\n\f324 E:cperi,ments in Thought-Transference.\nIV.\nEXPERIMENTS IN THOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE.\nBy ANTON SCHMOLL.\n(Tmmlated from the original Genna\u00bb.)\nThese experiments were made in the evening, in a. lighted room in\nmy house, 111, Avenue de Villiers, Paris, with the assistance of ~L\nEtienne Mabire [of 65, Rue Blanche, Paris], retired marine officer, ~Ille.\nLouise M., and my wife. A young officer, M. D., assisted at No.1.\nWe worked in the dining-room, the positions being shown in the\na.ccompanying plan.\nTahk.\no\u00a3 t\n.,\n-J:\n\u2022\n..\n,I' 1 '\nA. A\n, l'I. IfII4.r\nWe experimented in the following manner. The person appointed\nto reproduce the objects (drawings or real things) sat with his back to\nthe others, in the corner of the room P, his eyes being covered. I call\nthis person the percipient because his part ~g~RM!\\.~~ passive\n\fExperime'1llt8 in ThO'UfJht-Tramference. 325\nreception of psychical impressions; while the business of the other\npersons, the agents, consists in producing the impression through\nconrentration of their attention and through energetic volition. In\nthe above plan, P represents the percipient, A the agents (only in the\n:first 10 experiments the two outside agents sat at a), 0 is the spot\nwhere the object to be guessed was laid or placed. The light, L, came\nfrom a hanging lamp. The arrows show the direction of the eyes.\nAfter the percipient was comfortably settled in the corner P,\nabout three metres distant from the object, and had been blindfolded, a\nfigure in thick lines was drawn on a sheet of white paper by one of\nthe agents, and the drawing was laid down flat upon the table at O.\nThis procedure seeming to be unfa.'\\'\"ourable to the success of the\nexperiment in six trials, we set the drawing upright. In the later\ntrials, as already mentioned, the agents, whose line of vision had at first\nalmost crossed each other at right angles, sat in a line, side by side, in\norder to avoid the slightest divergence in the direction of their looks.\nIn binding the eyes, the bandage should not be drawn too tight, as\nthe pressure them causes a continuous flickering of the eyelids, which\ninterferes with good results. All that is required is to cover the eyes,\n80 that all direct vision is impossible, and for this end great pressure\nis not necessary. The percipient is recommended to close the eyes\nlightly, and thus to avoid all muscular exertion.\nIn the seven last trials we chose a real object, which we laid down\nor set up at O. It has appeared advisable that, with the exception\nof the object to be guessed, there should be nothing to be seen on the\ntable which could influence or distract the thoughts of the agents. (See\ntrial 22.) During the experiments, complete quiet was maintained.\nThe agents gazed uninterruptedly at the object, and concentrated their\nwhole will on the desire to make a mental impression on the percipient.\n- The latter was recommended to give himself up to a completely passive\ncondition, and carefully to avoid I!training his mind in search of the\nidea..\nThe object was of course always hidden before the handkerchief\nwas taken from the eyes of the percipient, except in cases where the\nattempt had failed, and when there WIloS no question of transference.\nThe object was placed quite quietly on the table, which was covered\nwith a thick tabllHlover, so that the percipient could not hear the\nslightest noise on its being laid down. Precise notes were at once\ntaken of the results and details of each trial.\nAs to the experimenters, the following may be said :-Mlle. Louise\nM., aged 25, is lively and cheerful; my wife, aged 39, of a calm\ntemperament; M. Mabire, aged 59, earnest, thoughtful, and of\nsober judgments. As to myself, I am 45 years, exceptionally sensitive,\notherwise very well in health.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f326 Experiments in TluYught-Transference.\n}'rom the\" beginning it was arranged amongst us that we should\nmoat carefully guard against self-deception, and especially against\nexaggeration of the impreaaions that we received. We simply wanted\nto find out what there was in the matter, and it would have little\nprofited us to embellish the results.\nWhether any of us is hypnotically or somnambulistically disposed\nis not yet ascertained. Several sittings which we lately held for the\npurpose of obtaining \"raps\" were completely without result. If any\nmediumistic power exists among us, it has certainly not as yet been\ndeveloped.\nWe were none of us sceptical with respect to psychical events in\ngeneral; but if we did not feel ourselves justified in denying apriori\nthings which competent authorities assert to have been established, still\nwe were more or leas inclined to the view that the majority of these\nphenomena were of a subjective nature.\nAccording to our experience, the following are the mental processes\nthat took place before the closed eyes of the percipient. For many\nminutes, sometimes quite a quarter of an hour, he sees nothing. Soon,\nhowever, it appears as though a white shimmer of a certain form was\nperiodically moving in the field of vision. Little by little this vague,\ninconstant picture appears in & manner to condense itself, and to make\nits appearance at shorter intervals. He begins to seize certain outlines,\nwhich become clearer from minute to minute, till he at last says, \"Now\nI believe I see what it is.\"\nIf an attempt appeared about to fail, the percipient, still blind-\nfolded, approached us, and gave his hands to two of the agents, whilethe\nthird closed the chain. But it does not appear that this proceeding,\nwith us, at any rate, has any special efficacy. The intensity of the\nmental pictures was not essentially increased by it, and if previously\nthere had been no picture, none usually appeared after we had formed\nthe chain. With us there can be no question of muscl~reading.\nLastly, be it remarked that among those who took part in the trials\nthere existed no real difference in the faculty for thought-reading.\nNeither did this faculty make any progreaa during the course of the\nexperiments.\n1.-JuZy 20th, 1886.\n..4.genu.-M.

In no single case, strictly speaking. did there\nappear absolute discrepancy between the form of the reproduction\n.and that of the original. We han therefore been able to convince\nourselves that the agents, concentrating their looks on the given object,\nprojected on the mental eye of the percipient a picture more or less\nresembling it, and we take it as incontrovertible that the above results\n,could not have been achieved by conscious or unconscious guessing.\nWe shall continue these psychical experiments, and should be glad to see\nsimilar ones instituted in other family circles; for before science can\nadvance to the synthesis of these mental phenomena, 80 little known\nand yet 80 important, as large a supply as possible of empirical data\nmust be obtained. No doubt there may be a difficulty in finding people\nin one's neighbourhood who are competent to aid in the development of\nsuch experiments, and who would bring to them the necessary earnest-\nness and patience. But one should not let oneself be discouraged by a\nlittle trouble, when there is a chance of throwing light on events which.\ncorrectly apprehended, may lead us to the psychological proof of our\ntranscendental, imperishable Ego.\nNOTE BY F. W. H. MYBBB.\nThe greater part of the above series of figures were given in Sphinx\nfor February. 1887. On seeing them, I wrote to Herr Schmoll, who\nkindly oft'ered to allow me to join his group in the Avenue de Villiers.\nThis I accordingly did on April 2, 5, and 8. I thus made the acquain-\ntance of Herr and Frau Schmoll, of M. Mabire, of Mlle. Louise, and of\nsome newer members of the group; and I saw experiments conducted,\nwith good faith and care, precisely in the manner above described.\nThe only point which struck me as needing further attention was the\nneed of complete abstinence from exclamations until the percipient has\nfinished drawing the figure. (See Exp. 21.) I suggested also that the\npercipient had better be called into the room, already blindfolded, when\nthe pictures had been drawn and concealed from view. I do not,\nhowever, think that any indication can have been gathered from the\nsound of the drawing; as this was done with the end of a lucifer-\nmatch, dipped in ink, and daubed noiselessly on the paper. There is a\nslight inaccuracy in the account of Exp. 21, which we have\nthought it better to leave as it stands.

I will add that Mlle. Louise\nwas the only percipient who attained real success when I was present;\nand I suspect that she will be found the most gifted of the group. I\nsaw her only on April 8.\nBetween March 4th and 25th, Herr Schmoll continued the series of\ndrawings, &c., Nos. 27-47, with mingled success and failure. Nos. 48-55\nwere tried in my presence, but were on the whole unsuccessful. Nos.\n56-65, performed without me, included several successes. Nos. 66-69\nwere again performed in my presence, under excellent conditions, and\nof these, 66 and 69, where the percipient was Mlle. Louise, are among\nthe most interesting of the series. We hope to give a reproduction of\nsome of these on a future occasion. Herr Schmoll has since, at my\nsuggestion, tried the transmission of nwmber8, taste\u2022\u2022 and paim, but as\nyet without success.\nWe hope before long again to take some personal part in this inter-\nesting series; and we trust that other groups may be encouraged by\nHerr Schmoll's success to undertake similar experiments with patience\nand care.\nDigi\n\f338 Accou-nts of some So-called\" Spiritualistic\" Sea'M68.\nv.\nACCOUNTS OF SOME SO-CALLED \"SPIRITUALISTIC\"\nSEANCES.\nBy PROFESSOR H. CUVILL LEWIS, M.A., F.G.S., AND OrHERS.\nSome editorial explanation is perhaps needed, for those who are not\nfamiliar with Spiritualistic literature, of the prominence given in the\nfollowing pages to a single medium. Eglinton is undoubtedly considered\nby Spiritualists in England, and throughout a great part of Europe, to be\nthe most powerful professional\" psychic' at present giving seances, and\nthe one through whom conclusive evidence of the spiritual origin of the\nphenomena can best be obtained. He even carries the palm over the\nonce famous D.D. Home, in the opinion of some who have known both.\nHis phenomena may therefore be fairly taken as typical, BO far as\nprofessional mediumship is concerned, of the evidence on which the\nSpiritualistic belief rests; and an examination of his claims is\ntherefore an important step in the investigation of the subject.\nEglinton has now been acting as a medium for BOme 12 years or so,\nand his ~ances are of various kinds. There are the dark seances at\nwhich lights appear, and objects are moved about while the medium's\nhands are supposed to be held; materialisation seances-alao held in\ndarkness or semi-darkness-at which living beings purporting to be\n\" materialised .. spirits, are seen, felt, and talked with by the sitters;\nand ~ces for slate-writing or \"psychography,\" at which writing\nappears on slates under circumstances which, in the opinion of most of\nthe sitters, render it impossible for Eglinton to have produced it him-\nself.\nIt\"is with this last class of phenomena that we are here concerned.\nSlate-writing is supposed to be a phenomenon specially easy to investi-\ngate satisfactorily, and specially adapted to convince the sceptic.\nReports on the subject had been sent from time to time to the head-\nquarters of the Society; and in accordance with a rather generally\nexpressed wish, the whole body of them* were printed in the Society's\nJowmal for June and October, 1886. But since many readers of the\nProceedings do not see the Jowmal (which is issued for private\ncirculation among our own members), it may be well to gi.e here\none or two fresh specimens of the class of cases on which Spiritualists\n\u2022 One report, Bent by the Rev. A. J. Rogers, was accidentally omitted; it\nafterwards appeared in Light for October 16, 1886.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fAccounts of 80me So-coIled\" Spirittutl.istic\" Seances. 339\nhave relied. We will take examples which have been represented by\nleading Spiritualists as test-ca.ses--as conclusive evidence, for any\nunprejudiced mind, that the results were due to some occult agency.\nIn the footnotes appended, which have been supplied by Mrs.\nSidgwick. an endeavour is made to show, with the aid of the narratives\nthat follow in this paper and in Mr. Davey'S, the reasons why we\nregard these accounts as inconclusive.\nThe following case was contributed by \"M.A. (Oxon.),,--a nom\nde plume well known to Spiritualists as that of a leading repre-\nsentative of English Spiritualism, to Light for November 13, 1886.\nOn November 3rd I had a sitting with Mr. Eglinton at his house, 6,\nNottingham-place. The obseners present, beside myself, were Dr.\nStanhope Speer (13, Alexandra-road, N.W.), and Mr. W. G. Johnson (68,\nHigh-street, Bedford). We met at 3.30 p.m. in a room which was amply\nlighted, at first by natural light and afterwards by gas, for every purpose of\nexact observation. The room is that inaccurately described by Professor\nHoffmann as \"a ground-floor back shut in by adjacent buildings.\" Mr.\nEglinton's room is not shut in by anything that impedes the free entry of\nlight. At no time during the sitting was there any question as to the\np088ibility of seeing what was being done, nor, I may add, of keeping the\nslates .. under continuous observation.\"\nI took with me two ordinary school-slates, purchased by myself. In\norder to guard against the possibility of these slates being changed or the\nsurfaces being reversed, I had marked one of the two slates on the frame\nof one of its sides with a blue cross, and on the other with a blue circle.\nThe other slate was similarly marked with green. It thus became a matter\nof very simple observation to see that the writing was not produced by trick\non the under surface of the slate when held beneath the table, a change in\nthe slate being (as has been suggested) effected while the attention of the\nobservers was purposely distracted. There was no possibility of any such\ntrick throughout the sitting.!\n1 It is unnecessary to suppose any change of slates in order to explain the\nevents of this seance, and it is most probable that they were not changed. The\nprecautions, as described, however, wonld not afford complete security against\nsuch change, since, so far as appears from the description, the marks might\nhave been imitated.\nAs to turning over, there is not enough precision in the accounts to enable\nus to judge whether, on the hypothesis of conjuring, we must suppose the slates\nto have been either turned over, or turned in their own plane. But I do not see\nthat any mark would prevent this which was not (a) visible all the time the\nslate was under the table !Lnd (b) observed during all that time. From what is\nsaid, I should infer that condition (a) and therefore necessarily condition (b)\nwas absent; for it is Mr. Eglinton's thumb, and not the frame ofthe slate, or any\nmark on it, that is mentioned as continuously villible. (Compare Professor\nCarviIl Lewis's description of the position at the beginning of his first seance,\np. 353.) Under these circumstances, the utmost the marks could do was to\nmake it easier for the sitters to see whether the side which was uppermost just\nDigi z 2\n\f340 Accou.nts 0\/ some So-called \"Spiritualutic\" Sla'ltCe8.\nMr. Eglinton sat at one side of a square table, which was not covered by any\ncloth. At hill right hand, dOle to the Ilate when held in position, at the\ncomer of the table, sat Mr. Johnson, keenly scrutinilling every movement of\nMr. Eglinton. Oppoaite to the medium was Dr. Speer with bill eyea fixed\non the alate without, as I can teatiIy 8IIuredly,1 any lack of \"continuous\nobBervation.\" (In a letter to me Dr. Speer remarka after reading my Il&IT&-\ntive, \"I have no alteration whatever to luggeat. I may _rt, however,\nthat upon each occasion that the alate was placed under the table I ne\\\"'er\nonce lost Bight of Eglinton'B thumb until the alate was again placed on\nthe table.\")* Next to Mr. Eglinton I sat, using, to the beat of my ability,\nluch powera of obaervation BB I am endowed with. I will be 10 bold as to\nsay that it would not be eBBy to find three peraonl who, by long experience\nof paychical phenomena and careful thought about them in two of 111, and in\nthe third CIIC by trained habits of accurate scientific obBervation and thought,\nwere more competent to expreu an opinion BB to what occurred. I will say\nfurther that any l&Ile man, with eyes in hiB head and the power of uaing\nthem, would be fully competent to teatify to that which we obaerved. The\nonly alates uled during the Bitting were my two school.a1atea: and the folding\nalate with lock. familiar to the public BB being in regular UIIC at Mr. Eglin-\nton'l littinga: nor were there any other alatea on or near the table at which\nwe sat.\nMr. JohnBOn, as an inveatigator new to Mr. Eglinton, was requeated to\ncommence the firat experiment by writing a queation on one of my a1atea.\nI luggeat.ed that the queatkn ahould be one not involving special knowledge.\nbut one that could be readily answered. While Mr. Johnaon wrote his\nqueation we all turned away from the table. It iB certain that nonA of ua\ncould _ or know what was written.s The alate was held by Mr. Eglinton\nunder the comer of the t.,,,ble, between him and Mr. Johnaon. The thumb\nof the hand which BUpported the slate was continuoualy visible above the\nsurface of the table. The query was, What iB the sum of 50 x 60 7 The\n&nawer was written after considerable waiting: 3,000. The figures were\nItraggling and ill\u00b7made.'\nbefore the alate WBB put under the table, WBB also uppermost just after it W88\ndrawn out.\nI If \"M. A.

Probably he did not know, however, Bnd hence, perhaps,\nthe neceuity for the subsequent\" considerable waiting\" while he aacertained.\n4 Thil first experiment consisted of two parts; the reading of a question\n8IIumed to be unknown to the medium and presumably written on one or other\nside of the slate which he held under the table; and the writing of an answer on\nthe slate under the table. Compare ProfC880r Carvill Lewill's experienCCl!.\npp. 354,3M. For accounts of writing by an avowed conjurer on a slate held under\nthe comer of the table, with the thumb of the hand continually visible, see Mr.\nDavey's paper, Sitting II, Reports 1 and 2 [a] pp. 426, 429.

I took out of my pocket-book five blank\ncheques. These cheques had been placed by me in my pocket-book at the\nend of last July. I had not looked at the numbe1'8 as I tore them from my\ncheque-book, nor when I put them into my pocket-book, nor had I ever\nremoved them or any of them since they were so placed. They were folded\ninto four parts, and the selected cheque W88 not unfolded before being placed\nin the slate. I requested Mr. Johnson to select one of them. He did so,\nand without looking at its number, I took it from him and placed it within\nthe folding-slate which Mr. Eglinton uses. Mr. Johnson locked the slate,\nand placed the key on the table before him. We fi1'8t endeavoured to get a\nmessage on one of my slates as to the possibility of getting the number of\nthe cheque written on the locked slate. The experiment was difficult, and\nwe did not wish to waste time. The answer came, ., We will try.\" The\nlocked slate, which had been all the time in full view, and which no amount\nof spare keys would have made it possible for Mr. Eglinton to unlock, was\nthen taken by Mr. Eglinton and held under the comer of the table next to\nMr. Johnson. At (nice, without appreciable interval, there came the per-\nfectly audible sound of writing. The slate on being withdrawn and unlocked\nby Mr. Johnson was found to have upon it\nC 16046\nI\nThat was the number of my cheque as \u00a5erified by all of us at once. It was\nwholly impOBBible for Mr. Eglinton to have seen my cheque, or to write on\nthe slate, for the reason that the locked slate was held in position under the\ncomer of the table in Buch a way that the thumb of the hand holding it was\ncontinuously mible.6\nAt this point in our experiments I suggested that the two docto1'8 should\ntest Mr. Eglinton's pulse. I had noticed that he was very considerably con-\nvulsed before our eal'B attested that writing was being done. I myself was\nI I think it probable that a lapse of memory-a complete omission-has\noccurred in respect to this experiment, and that, though the fact has been forgot-\nte~, the locked slate was held under the table for a short time directly after the\ncheque was enclosed. It was then,'I suspect, that Mr. Eglinton read the cheque,\nand wrote the number, after wbich it was probably he who led up to the sug-\ngestion that, as they did not seem to be succeeding, they should try to get a\nmessage on another slate as to the possibility of obtaining the phenomenon they\ndesired. This proceeding would natnrally make any previous dealing with the\nlocked slate seem unimportant, and make it likely to fade quickly from the\nmemory. I am confirmed in this view by Professor Carvill Lewis's experience\nin the course of a similar experiment, see pp. 31;6, 357. If no such previous\nprocess be supposed, there seems to be a certain inconsequence in tbe behaviour\nof the sitters; for why, if there was \u00abpriori reason to think the experiment likely\nto waste time, did they go through the process of selecting and locking up the\ncheque before inqubing of the spirits on the subject! Complete forgetfulness of\nreally important incidents undoubtedly occurs; see for example the Appendix to\nMr. Davey's article, Notes 1 and 17 to Sitting II pp. 488,489, and Notes 1\nand 6 to Sitting III p. 490.\nFor reading questions and writing answers in locked slates by a conjurer,\nsee Mr. Davey's article, Sittinb\n'8 VI [a] p. 448, XI [a] p. 469, XII [6] p. 471,\nand XIII [b] p. 472.\nDigitized by Coogle\n.\/\n\f342 Accounts of some So-called \"Spirituali8tic\" StamC4\nlimilarly aft'ected, and I felt able to tell by my own seDIILtiona when the\nwriting W81 about to be executed.

Mr. Eglinton'l pulll8, on being tried by the two\nmedical men, W81 found to be calm, lteady, healthy, and normal, but rather\nfeeble for a perlOn of hiB excellent phYlique. My own pulll8 wu not teated ;\nbut I fancy it would have been found, on trial, to be accelerated in lpeed.\nDr. Speer now wilhed to 81k a verbal question. The AaU hawing buR\nplaced in poaition, he inquired whether any relation of biB were prell8nt. The\nllate (my own) W81 held by Mr. EgIinton u before, and the writing came at\n_-I .y, and I mean, immediately-\" There are sel\"erai prell8nt, but we\nhave no power to tell of them.\" I\nI then BIked, not audibly, but writing my question on one of my own\nllatel, \"Do you 1188 any friend of mine 1 Give one name.\" Nine minutes\nelapaed before the writing came. On withdrawing the IIlate we found in\nquite diltinct writing from that obtained before,\n+ Imperator.\nThe writing wu very clear and decided ; the letten carefully and prettily\nformed j and it wu limilar to that which characterilea biBlignature in my\nboob of automatic writing. The name wu quite unexpected by me, and\ncame 81 a IUrprill8, for I had recently inquired for him without IUCC8118.'\nIt W8I then luggested by Mr. Egl!nton that we Mould endeavour to\nobtain writing under an inverted tumbler placed on one of my lIatea and\nprelll8d against the under lurface of the table. I, on the Ipur of the moment,\nuked Mr. Johnson to select a number under ten. He picked fil\"e. Dr. Speer,\nIimilarly 81ked, selected nine. I chOll8 four. The combined numben made\n594. I uked that that combination of numben should be written under the\ninverted tumbler. Itwu done at OtICe j with no appreciable interval of writing\nafter the Ilate W81 in polition ; the sound of writing W&8 quite audible; the\nfigures were bold and decided-l\"ery different from those that were made in\nthe first experiment.8 Then\" Good-bya,\" and the litting 11\"&8 anded.\nNow it seems to me that only the mOlt perver118 ingenuity can diBtort\nevidence of thiB quality into a mere record of conjuring tricb; or luggeat\nI FOT an answer to a verbal question coming immediately on the sitter's\nown slate under the table, see Mr. lJavay's article, Sitting I, Repor~ 1 [c) p. 421.\n7 The remarks in note 'apply here. I need only add that we cannot\n&B8ume the signature of II Imperntor\" to have been unknown to Mr.\nEglinton. The superiority of the writing to that in the first experiment may\nprobably have been due to an accidentally better opportunity for executing it.\nI suspectthat litters are often more watchful during the tirst experiment than\nduring later ones. Compare, fOT handwriting varying in excellence with\nopportunity, Profe880r Carvill Lewis's experience, pp. 365, 366.\n\u2022 Compare Professor Carvill Lewis's account of a similar phenomenon and\nits mode of perfonnance, p. 362. I suspect, however, that in the present case\nMr. Eglinton found the opportunity of writing the figures before the slate waa\nin position. He may have written each number &8 it was chosen. For a per-\nformance by an avowed coujurer resembliug this, so far u the tumbler is\nconcerned, but perhaps more striking, see Mr. Davey's article, Sitting II,\nReport 1 [e) p. 428, and Sitting XVI [Il] p. 482.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fAccownts 0\/ WIne &-called \"SpiTitu,alistic\" Seances. 343\nthat the experimenta were vitiated by lack of \"continuous observation\" ; or\nthat we, the obaerven. were not competent to obBerve and record what\noccurred under the most careful scrutinyby our three pain of watchful eyes.e\nFor my part it Be8ma neceaaary only to mention such criticism in order to\nbrand it as the outcome of ineradicable prejudice. It is mere waste of time\nto argue with it. It is, I fear, hopeleaa to expect that it would be modified or\nrevened by any amount of testimony even of the highest quality and value.\nI will not, therefore, take up space by showing how ludicrously inapplicable\nis the conjuring explanation to what we witn88118d.\nIt is, I think, greatly to be desired that the attention of phyaiologiata\nmould be drawn to the state of the psychic during the time when these\nphenomena are in proce88. For example, before writing is heard on the\nslate, Mr. Eglinton is nervous, anxious, and his body is usually much\ncontorted. His face sometimes wears an expreBBion of pained anxiety and\nalmost of nervous apprehension. When the slate is withdrawn this gives\nway to an expre88ion of relief. His fingen are cold, as though from the\nwithdrawalof energy. Sometimes he shivers as though chilled. The presence\nof a qualified surgeon, who might be able to make a Beries of careful\nobservationS at sittings for psychography, and eapecially for materialiaation,\nis greatly to be desired. I may add, by way of fixing attention on the qualitJ\nof this evidence ;-\n1. That moat of the writing occurred on my own slates ; and that there\nwere no other slates on the table or within Mr. Eglinton's reach, so\nthat suggestions of change are excluded.,lO\n2. That no one in the room had ever Been the number of my cheque, so\nthat suggestions of thought-transference are excluded.\n3. That in two cases the writing was immediate on the request being\nmade. It was done on my slate, and therefore the suggestions of\nprevious preparations and of writing under the table by the medium\nare excluded.l1\n4. That the fragment of pencil or chalk placed on the alate, and pre-\nvioualy marked for identification, was found in all cases to have ita\nfacet slightly worn away by use, and that it rested on the spot\nwhere the writing terminated.lJ\n\u2022 We have no means of knowing that the witneaaes on this OCCUlon were\nbetter observers or more careful than the recorders of similar marvels at Mr.\nDavey's seances, and the lack of precise statement about the position of the\nslates under the table, the position of the writing-both questions and\nanswers-and about the watching of the marks made for identification on the\nslates, suggests a lack of careful observation; while there are other indica\u00b7\ntions-to some of which I havecalled attention--that the recorder of this .eance\nwas unaware of the difficulties of observation.\n10 As before stated there is no reason to suppose any change of slates, but\nthe sitters cannot have known that Mr. Eglinton had none concealed, e.g.\nabout his person, or his chair.\n1J See nolie8 8 and 8; and for a case, with a conjurer, of a long meaaage\non the sitters' own slates on the table beginning\" almost instantaneously,\"\nwhich of course is more than was\u00b7 obtained at the seance under consideration,\nsee Mr. Davey's article, Sitting I, Reports 1 and 2 [g] pp. 421, 424.\n12 Compare Mr. Davey's article, Sitting I, ReP,9rt I., Inhd~\nDigitized DY \\SOU<3Ie'\n\f34.4. .Accounts oj some So-called \"Spiritualistic\" Seances.\no.

Very soon after\nthis change had been made, writing was heard by all of us ; when it ceased, .\ntlie slate was withdrawn, and an answer was found to my wife's question.\nconsisting of two words, and the initials (If the friend to whom the question\nhad been addreB8ed.17 On examining the piece of pencil placed on the slate,\nand previously marked for identification, we found that on this, as on\nseveral subsequent occaaions, the facet had been worn by use.18 My wife then\nwrote another question underneath the same slate, and requested that the\nanswer might be written with a piece of blue chalk which was laid upon the\ntop of it. The slate was plaoed in position. and in less than three minutes an\nanswer was written in six words with blue chalk.IU It was then suggested by\nMr. Eglinton that each of us should name a number and the colour of the\nchalk in which we wished it written.

The box and envelope were then\nlaid on a slate which Mr. Eglinton held as usual, and we requested that the\ncontents of the box and the number of the note might be given. Writing\nwas heard at once, and the slate on being withdrawn was found to have the\nfollowing sentence upon it : \"A key is in the box: if you put the bank-note\nin the locked slate we will write the number.\" MiB8 Phillipps accordingly\nopened the envelope, and took out the bank-note, which was folded with the\nnumber inside, and, without unfolding it or allowing anyone present to see\n111 See references in note 13.\nl' It is not unlikely that this change gave him the BOught for opportunity\nof reading the question.\n17 See Prof8Sll0r Carvin Lewis's account, pp. 355, 365.

That Mr. Percival himaelf carried that slate to Mr. Eglinton'a house.\nplaced it on the table, and kept it under continuoUB observation\nthroughout the whole time that he was there.-\n3.

That the faatenings of the slate were intact when it was taken by Mr.\nPercival from Mr. Eglinton's hoUle, and that thOle fastenings were\nnot broken in his presence.\nThere has been much demand of late for \"continuoua observation\" to\nbe exerciaed by obaervera of thl'ae payohical phenomena; and there has been\nalso much talk of the powera of conjuren to aimulate these phenomena. We\nauggest that the narrative of Mr. Percival supplies material eminenUy\ndeserving of the careful attentioll of thOle who think that professed\nmediumship is a variety of conjuring. Will the Society for Psychical\nResearch offer a sufficient inducemont to any conjurer who will undertake to\nduplicate some half-dozen of the phenomena that have been recorded in our\ncolumor;211 who will further demonstrate that he has no abnormal PIIychics\ngifts to aid him; and, lastly, who will clearly ahow in every case the\nmethoda employed by him 7\nThere are illany interesting and suggestive points in Mr. Percival's narra-\ntive.

Moreover it wouM scarcely be\nconsistent with careful observation of the earlier events of the seance, some of\nwhich must in that case apparently have been described by Mr. Percival from\nthe observation of the other sitten-e.g. the exanrining of the fragments of\npencil.\n211 What is, in effect, an answer by Mr. Hodgson to this and similarsugges-\ntions, will be found in the next article, pp. 389, 390.

This is in accordance with our\nown experience, and is reasonable and intelligible. The contents of the\ncloeed box, not known (be it observed) to any person present, were wrongly\ngiven, but in Buch a way aB to suggest that the real object had been imper-\nfectly Been.30 The date of the florin WaB written in a way that BUggests the\nsame conclusion. The number of the bank-note could not be seen at all\nuntil it WaB transferred to the closed slate always used by the medium, when\nits number was at once- correctly given, though the note wall folded with the\nnumber inside, and WaB placed in the slate without being unfolded, and WaB\nmarked for purpose of identification.\nWe confess we see no room for the exercise of the conjuror's art under\ncircUlUBtanceS such aB those detailed by Mr. Percival. It will he for those\nwho rely on that explanation to show that these phenomena can be repro-\nduced by conjurers who demonstrably have not abnormal psychic powers to\naid them.\nThese are favourable specimens of the results which have given\nEglinton his exceptional position in the Spiritualistic world, and on\nthe strength of which he was selected to read a paper as an\naccredited exponent of Spiritualistic doctrine, at a recent meeting of\nthe London Spiritualist Alliance. And probably most persons\nwho approach the phenomena of modem Spiritualism in a serious\nspirit would think that such evidence as has been quoted consti-\ntutes a certain pri'T11d. facie case for the conclusion which\nSpiritualists draw from it. It seems scarcely leas rash to deny\nthan to affirm, as a mere matter of general impression and \"common-\nsense,\" that the conditions of observation were adequate. The question\nis one that needs most careful examination by special methods. The\nresults of such an examination will be found in Mr. Davey's paper a.\nlittle further on; but it may assist the reader if he comes to that paper\nwith a realisation of BOme preliminary facta.\nIn the first place, then, even those who regard the conditions of\nobservation which obtained in the above cases as adequate, must\nadmit that they are broadly the same in kind as those which obtain in\nconjuring performances, where the opportunity for the trick is\nfound in a. temporary distraction or skilful misdirection of the\nobserver's attention. There may be a difference of de[rree j that\nis to say, the points to be observed may have been easier to\nobserve, inasmuch as they were obvious beforehand; and the\nattention may have been proportionately harder to distract. But\nhowever much allowance be made for this, it is impOBBible to regard the\nconditions in question as equally perfect with others involving no\n10 If the word \"heard\" were 8ubstituted for the word \"seen\" iB this\neentence, the true explanation would perhaps be SUlI'geated. .. G I\nDigitized by oog e\n\f350 Accounts of some So-caJl,ed\" Spiritualistic\" Siances.\nstrain of attention, and no opportunity for distraction. Such conditions\nwould be supplied, for instance, by a hermetically-cl08ed vessel, whose\nweight and volume had been accurately determined before the seance\nbegan. If writing appeared on a slip of paper enclosed in such a vessel,\nit would probably be admitted, by even the most convinced Spiritualist,\nthat security had been made doubly secure. Humanum eat errare ; snd\nthe fact that nothing at all had depended on the exercise of the experi-\nmenter's human and therefore fallible faculties during the critical time\nwhen the mysterious occurrence took place must, 80 far, be an improve-\nment of the evidence. It is at least noteworthy, then, that no such feat\nas this has ever been recorded. So far as I know, there is no good\nevidence that results claimed for mediumship have ever been\nunmists.keably produced in a space shut off, wholly without aper-\ntures, from the external world; or in any circumstances whatever\nwhere there would have been a difficulty in producing them by obvious\nnatural means, apart from the question whether or not the medium was\nunder adequa.te observation at the time. This is a general fact, which\nclearly makes the determination of the question as to adequacyofobser-\nvation all-important.\nIn the second place, it must be remembered that the presumption, in\nEglinton's case, is in favour of fraud, since he has been undoubtedly\ndetected in the production of fraudulent phenomena. Some evidence of\nthis has been given in the JO'III1\"'TI4l of the Society. In one case, which\noccurred in 1876, the muslin and beard worn by the so-called\nmaterialised\u00b7spirit, and from which pieces were cut, were subsequently\nfound in Eglinton's portmanteau. The details are given in the\nJourna,l for June and November, 1886, as gathered from the Medium\nand Df1I!Jbreak for November 1 and 15, 1878, and the Spiritualist for\nFebruary 14 and March 21, 1879. In a.nother case, in 1882,\nEglinton co-operated with the notorious Madame BlavII.tsky in pro-\nducing the appearance of the occult transmission of a letter from the\nship Vega in mid ocean to Calcutta. The details will be found in\nHints on Esoteric Theosophy, and in the Report on PkenoTM1Ia\nconnected with T1UJosophy in the Proceedings of the S.P.R., Vol. III.,\npp. 264-256; and an abstract of the case appeared in the Journal\nfor June, 1886, pp. 283-287. In 1880, Mr. Eglinton was again\ndetected-as the evidence ~ be found in PllJlchiscke Studien for June\nand July, 1880, seems clearly to show-in himself producing the\nmovements of objects, &c., at a dark seance at Munich; though\nSpiritualists allege certain special reasons, which will be found in the\nnumbers of PllJlchiBcke Studien referred to, for doubting the validity\nof this \"exposure.\"\nThe above facts seem conclusive as to Eglinton's character during a\nconsiderable period of his career; but they have been objected to as\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fAccownts of 80me So-called \"Spiritualistic\" Seances. 351\nirrelevant to the more recent phenomena of slate-writing, on the ground\nthat in respect of these no accounts of detected fraud have hitherto\nbeen published. It might be replied that people who detect fraud of\nthe kind are not, as a rule, disposed instantly to rush into print. They\ngain nothing by doing so; while they are likely to encounter a certain\namount of ridicule for having even given the a.lleged phenomena a trial,\nto say nothing of the risk of an action for libel. It is within our\nknowledge that more tha.n one case has occurred of the same kind as\nthat of which the following account has been placed in our hands by\na la.dy who prefers that her name should not appear.\n\"February 5th, 1887.\n\" I will give, as far as I can remember, an account of our seance\nwith Mr. Eglinton. My friend, Mr. Godfrey Webb, made an\nappointment with him, giving his name, but not my name. When we\narrived at Mr. Eglinton's house he made us sit round a table, which\nhad no cover, and was close to a looking-glass, which reflected every-\nthing that was done. He placed me between himself and Mr. Webb,\na.nd we held each other's hands while he placed a slate under the table\nwith his left hand. After a little while we heard a scratching from the\nslate, and when he produced it there were one or two words written on\nit. This process was repeated several times, but we all thought it very\nunsatisfactory. Mr. Eglinton remarked the spirit was not very\nwilling, and that we had better talk, as it would help it to manifest\nitself. I must add that while he was holding the slate under the\ntable, and we heard the scratching, he seemed suffering from a kind of\nconvulsion. His face was livid a.nd contorted, and the perspiration\nwas running down it; his breathing was also hard. He asked me to\nthink of somebody from whom I should wish to get a message, which I\ndid; and then a few words were a.gain scratched on the slate, but with\nno partiCUlar meaning-which I told him. He then said, 'This is not\nat all satisfactory; let 'us change places.' I moved to where Mr. Webb\nwas, and he took my place. At the same time Mr. Eglinton said, ' We\nmust also change the slates'; Bnd while he was doing so I distinctly saw\nhim run his hand over a slate; his hand was clenched. I asked him to\nlet me see the writing on the slate, to which he said, 'Oh, there is\nnothing.' I said, 'Yes, there is; please let me see it.' He showed it\nto me, and I saw the beginning of a sentence. He then said, 'I was\nonly scribbling.' But as he had no pencil in his hand, it must have\nbeen with a small pencil lead, which he placed in his closed\nhand (not his fingers), and which I could not see, as it was too small.\nHe used the same kind of small lead for the slates (which he placed be-\ntween the two slates before he locked them up). After this incident he\nbecame angry, and said, ,It is of no use to try, as you are incredulous\nand suspicious the spirit will not come,' and we then left him.'C' I\nDigitized by oog e\n\f352 Accounts of 8Q1M So-called \"Spiritualistic\" seances.\nMr. Godfrey's Webb's general view is that mediums are ready to\n\"supplement any genuine power they may possess by quite ordinary\ntricks\"; and while unable to attribute to trickery some of tbe\nphenomena which he has witnessed in Eglinton's presence, he says, \"I\ndo not wish to deny that - - detected Mr. Eglinton, on the occasion\nyou refer to, wliting words on a slate; and I rejoiced at her astuteness\nat the time.\"\nIt is impossible in this case to doubt the conviction of both sitters\nat the time that they had detected trickery, though owing to tbe\nlong interval (nearly 3 years) between the sitting and the recording\nof it, stress ought not to be laid on the details. This objection does\nnot apply to the careful record of Professor Carvill Lewis, to which\nit is now high time that the reader should be introduced.\nACCOUNT FROM PROFESSOR H. CARVILL LEWIS.\nNunlerous and marvellous statements have recently appeared in\nTarious pUblications concerning the manifestations produced at the\nseances of the famous medium Mr. W. Eglinton; and in the Spiritualist\npaper, Light, for October 16th, 1886, an immenae ID&88 of testimony,\nby about one hundred different observers, many of them of high.\nintellectUII.I ability and social position, is given to show that the slat&-\nwriting and accompanying phenomena occurring at his seances are not\ndue to any deliberate action on the part of the medium, but to some\nunknown force, or, as one writer puts it, \"conclusively establish the\nexistence of some objective, intelligent force, capable of acting exter-\nnally to the medium, and in contravention of the recognised laws of\nmatter.\" * These various statements,t suggesting a new field of\n\u2022 Light, No. 302, p. 488.\nt Profe8llOrs N. Wagner, A. Boutlerof, and A. Dobroelavin, of the\nUniversity of St. Petersburg, concluded an account of a seance with Mr.\nEglinton as follows :-\" After witn888ing the experiments above described we\nhave come to tbe conclu8ion : (1) That the mediumistic autDgraphic-lITiting is\ngenuine, and cannot be referred to the domain of prestidigitation, or explained\nby the help onlv of generally-recognised mechanical, physical, or chemical\nlaws. (2) That it can manifest an intelligence of its own not depending to a\ncertain degree upon that of those who assist at the sc!anceB; and (3) This\nphenomenon, by its objectivity, especially afforda facility for observation, &lid\ndeserves full attention and investigation from competent person8 and\ninBtitutions.\" (Journal of the S.P.R., Vol. II., p. 331.)

I have endeavoured to make the following account\nas accurate as possible, having written it immediately afterwards\nfrom full notes taken during the sMnces.\nFirst Seance.\nHaving called upon Mr. Eglinton the previous evening and made\nan appointment, I visited him at noon on November 16th, and was\nushered into his study. A common wooden table, which had apparently\nseen rough usage and was covered by a tablecloth, stood in the middle\nof the room, which was well lighted. Mr. Eglinton expressed disap-\npointment that I had not brought a second person with me, as he\nhad requested. He said that it might be difficult to get results with\nonly one. I had, however, purposely come alone, prepared to observe\ncarefully and without prejudice.\nMr. Eglinton asked me to write one question on the slate which\nI had brought with me, and another question on one of his own slates.\nHe left the room while I wrote the questions, at my request, and\nafforded me an opportunity to satisfy myself that the slate and table\nwere ordinary ones, and in no way prepared, as I was convinced after\ncareful examination. He entered when I called, and seated himself\nnear one corner of the table, placing me on the other side of the same\ncorner, the cloth having been removed and a short leaf put up. He\ntook his own slate, on the under side of which was my question, and\nputting upon it a minute fragment of slate-pencil, placed it under the\ntable, holding it against the under side of the table-leaf with the four\nfingers of his right hand, his thumb alone being visible. With his left\nhand he stretched across the corner and held my two hands. The con-\nditions were such that there was no possibility of my seeing the slate or\nhis four fingers. I could see his wrist, however, above, and his knees\nand feet below the table, and could detect, I think, any motion of his\nfingers by the movement of the tendons of the wrist.\nWe sat in this position for three-quarters of an hour, I paying strict\nattention. Nothing whatever was done. As a result of the constrained\nposition in which I was placed, leaning on my right arm, my hand and\narm then began to tremble slightly. Mr. Eglinton, perceiving tIns,\nasked if I did not feel a peculiar current in my arm. ' I assented, but\nin order to determine whether this was due to any \"magnetic\" or\nother force proceeding either to or from the medium, or was simply a\nnatural tremor, I let go of his hand and leaned in the same position,\nwhen I again felt the same tremor, and on finding that it ceased so soon\nas I changed my position, even when I held Mr. Eglinton's hand, I was\nconvinced that it was merely nervous and subjective.\nWe went on with the sMnce, Mr. Eglinton encouragin~nvel'l!A\u00ad\nized by '_:PPSle\n\u2022\n\f8641 .Accounts of 801M So-called \"SpirittudiBtic\" seQ\/MelI.\ntion. He said that as the manifestations were entirely beyond his own\nCOBtrol, it was best to think of other matters. He favoured me with\nan extraordinary explanation of hypnotism, and recounted lOme of his\nexploits in Spiritualism.* He repeatedly asserted that his own mind\nand will had no effect whatever upon matter, and that the phenomena\ncame from without. He was quite correct in denying that \"Thought-\ntransference\" had any part in the results, as one of our experiments\nafterwards proved. So long as I kept my eye on his hand and the edge\nof the slate nothing occurred. He attempted several times DOW,\nunsuccessfully, to divert my attention.\nIt DOW occurred to me that unless I purposely diverted my attention\nfrom him, the ance might be a failure. I therefore looked away from\nhim toward the window on my left, hoping that now the spirits would\nappear. They immediately did 80, as I both felt through Mr. Eglinton's\nhand held in mine, and allO partially saw. The slate, or one end of it,\neeemed to be lowered beneath the table, and I saw the medium look\ndown intently toward his knees and in the direction of the slate. I\nnow quickly turned back my head, when the slate was brought up\nagainst the table with a sharp rap. Mr. Eglinton eeemed confused,\nand, complaining of the weight of the slate and the heat of the room,\nput the slate on top of the table and diverted the conversation.\nI suggested that we try the other slate-a small, light, American\nslate of my own. He put this under the table in the same way, and\nagain I paid strict attention. There was no result. Having asked me\nas to the nature of my questions, stating that the unknown powers\nwhose coming we awaited were not omniscient, I answered that I had\nprepared three questions. The first (on his large slate) was one which\na spirit would know, but he could not possibly know; the second (on\nmy small slate) was one which a spirit would not know, but he might\nknow; and the third (in a sealed envelope) was one which both he and\nthe spirits knew perfectly well. The questions were as follows :-The\nfirst, \"Where is my wife 1\" Mr. Eglinton could not know, as I came\nunder an assumed name, but a spirit who knew me, or could read my\nthoughts, or could see as far as Wales would have known. The second,\n\" Define Idocrase,\" a spirit would not know unless he be a mineralogist,\nbut Mr. Eglinton could readily know by consulting a dictionary. The\nthird, \"Multiply two by two,\" would be evident to both spirit and\nmedium provided they could get at the question in the sealed envelope.\nWe went on with the anee, and again I found that I must divert\nmy attention if results were to be had. I suggested trying the large\n\u2022 One of these W8.8 the conversion of Mr. Kellar, the conjurer, to\nSpiritualism. So far is this from being Iihe case, that Mr. Kellar, whom I know\npersonally. is nightly offering in America \u00a320 to anyone who will produce\nSpiritualistic phenomena that he cannot imitate by conj~.\nDigitized by ~oo8le\n\fAccounts of 80me So-called \"Spiritualistic\" Seances. 355\nslate once more, and now, before he could get tired holding it, I\ndeliberately looked away. This time, as I turned back quickly, he\ndropped the slate upon the floor, question side uppermost and nearest\nto him, as if the slate had\u00b7 been revolved. He excused himself as\nbefore, complaining of the weight of the slate. Again we tried the\nsmall slate, and again no result so long as I watched closely.\nI now tried a different method. Agreeing with him that it was best\nto divert my attention, I proposed reading a book while he held the\nslate.* He brought me a book, which I placed on the table to my right,\nand, turning my head partly away from him, began reading. Under\nthese conditions the \"spirits\" immediately and without a moment's hesi-\ntation set to work. Mr. Eglinton began to breathe loudly, and to\nmove uneasily, and in such a way that I judged he was altering the\nposition of the slate. About this time Mr. Eglinton left the room for\nseveral minutes.\nContinuing the seance under the conditions just described, I BOon\nheard, notwithstanding his heavy breathing, sighing, and jerking, that\nwriting was being done with a pencil on the slate. Unnoticed by him,\nI now slightly turned my head, so that I could see his wrist. I\ndistinctly saw the flW'Vement of the entral tendon in '~is wriBt, corre-\nsponding to that made by his middle finger in the act of writing. Each\nmovement of the tendon was simultaneously accompanied by the sound\nof a scratch on the slate.\nHe now pulled out the slate Bnd showed me on its upper side the\nanswer to my question, \"Define Idocra.se.\" There in hasty, yet\ndistinct characters was written, \"It consists of Silica, Albumina, and\nLime.\" The true answer shouldhave been \"It consists of Silica, Alumina,\nand Lime.\" As will be stated more fully at the close of this account,\nthe answer is precisely such as might be obtained by a hasty glance at\nthe definition in a dictionary. Mr. Eglinton was careful to draw\nmy attention to the fact that one corner of the slate-pencil was worn\ndown.\nWe now tried the large slate, on which was the question, \"Where\nis my wife 1\" under the same conditions, i.e., that of rnm-attention. I\nagain read a book, turning my head away from him, though not so far\nbut that I could see by a side glance. Again the spirits promptly\nreturned, and again I was conscious by indicative motionsthat the slate\nwas being manipulated. He then said aloud as if to a spirit, \" Shall we\nhave an answer 1\" I looked away so as to give the spirits a chance, and\nimmediately heard a vigorous and loud scribbling. It sounded like a series\nof sharp zigzags,-thus, \"~.\" I was sur-\n\u2022 It was the small elate with the question which only a mineralogical\nspirit oQuld an.ewer.\n\f356 .Accounts of 80me So-called \"Spiritualistic\" Seance&.\nprised to find only the short word\" No,\" written in a round hand,\nwhen the slate, immediately afterwards, was shown me, since the 8Cril~\nbling I heard certainly lasted much longer than it would have taken to\nwrite this word. Again he asked me to examine the fragment of\nchalk; but I found it more worn down than necessary for the short\nanswer. In order to test this, I took another sharp comer of the\naame pencil and wrote the word \"No\"; but found that in order to\n'Wear down the comer to an equal degree it was neceaaa.ry to write the\nword twice, or to make a zigzag figure of the same length as the BOund\nhad indicated. It occurred to me that the wearing down of the\npencil fragment was a non-eaaential portion of the manifestation, and\nthat the real writing was done with another pencil.\nIt appearing that neither Mr. Eglinton nor the spirits were\nable to answer a question which the former did not know, I proposed\ntrying the question in the closed envelope, the answer to which should\nbe easy to both powers. Mr. Eglinton declined to attempt this, giving\nas his r8IIoSon that as I knew the question, it might be set down as\nI< thought-reading\" if an answer was obtained. He proposed that I\nshould write in his own folding-slate,-a handsome affair in hard wood\nframe, and with a brass lock, being the same, as he informed me, which\nMr. Gladstone had used. I had no great fancy for working with\nspecially prepared apparatus, and suggested dispensing with all slates,\nand asking the unknown powers to write upon a piece of paper in my\npocket. This was declined on the ground that just as a chemical re-\naction can be obtained only by special methods and apparatus, BO a\nmanifestation of these unknown powers requires apecial conditions\n'Which are learned by experience.\nI then followed his suggestion and agreed to simply write a number\non a piece of paper and put it inside of his folding-slate. In order to\npreclude the possibility of \"thought-transference,\" I wrote a large\nseries of numbers on different slips of paper, and then throwing them\ninto a hat chose one of them, and, without looking at what was written,\nfolded it in four, and, after pressing it tightly, put it in his slate\ntogether with a fragment of red chalk. The slate was closed with a\nspring lock, and after the key was handed to me, the slate was held\nunder the table as before. In order to obtain the necessary condition\nof non-attention, I busied myself in writing notes for this account, my\nleft hand being held in his left. I listened intently, however, and also\nfelt for any indications. Although I could see nothing, I was again con-\nscious by varied and delicate motions and sounds that some power was\nopening the slate, lifting up the paper, unfolding it, refolding it, and\nreplacing it. I distinctly heard the rustling sound of the paper being\nunfolded and refolded. Meanwhile, Mr. Eglinton breathed heavily, and\njerked to and from the table as before. As. the ~te h~ a spring\nDigitized by GOogle\n\fAccownts of some So-caUed \"Spi\/ritualistic\" Seances. 357\nlock and shut with a snap, I wondered if this could be accomplished\nwithout my hearing the sharp sound. Mr. Eglinton now gave a sudden\nand strong sneeze, and at the same moment the slate was clapped\nagainst the under side of the table. Mr. Eglinton had showed no signs\nof a cold until this moment.\nHe now said to me, \u2022\u2022 I feel the influence strongly,\" and placing his\nfolding-slate on the top of the table continued, \"Will you ask if we\ncan get an answer 1\" As the answer had, as I was convinced, been\nalready written, this request seemed to me superfluous, but neverthe-\nless, in as grave a voice as the occasion seemed to require, I did so.\nMr. Eglinton having put an ordinary slate with a bit of chalk upon it\nbeneath the table, and I having looked away, in a few moments he\nproduced it again with the words, \"We will try,\" written in the same\nhandwriting I had already seen. Both slates now being em top of ~\nMble, but his right hand being beneath it, Mr. Eglinton said\" Listen,\"\nand I heard the sound of writing beneath the table, as of the scratching\nof a slat&-pencil against its under side. This procedure may have been\nintended to make me think that the spirits were now writing in the\nclosed slate lying on top of the table. It would have been more con-\nvincing, however, had the hand of the medium been in sight. I hardly\nthought, moreover, that the soft red chalk in the slate would make\nthe shrill sound that I heard. Having been asked to open the slate\nwith the key I had kept, I found the figure 8, the same as that on the\nfolded paper, written on the slate in red chalk. It was thus proved\nthat \"thought-transference\" was not the agent which produced the\nwriting; and as yet the evidence ;vas not convincing as to the agency\nof any\" objective, intelligent force capable of acting externa.lly to the\nmedium, and in contravention of the recognised laws of matter.\" This\nended the seance, and, having paid my guinea, I departed.\nAfter reaching home, I found that I had inadvertently left with\nMr. Eglinton my small American slate, with the question \"Define\nIdocrase,\" and its answer. I therefore sent him a note asking for the\nslate, and also for a statement that the phenomena I had witnessed\nwere not executed by himself, but were due to extra-physical forces\nbeyond his control. The next day the slate was returned, and with it\na note giving me the statement requested. This gave me an opportunity\nof comparing the handwriting on the slate with that of the note.\nFacsimiles of the two are here appended (Figs. 1 and 2).\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f358 Accounts of some So-called \"Spiritualistic\" Sea\/n~.\nFIG. 1.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f4\n\"\n.....\n, ~ -\n-.-...\n\u00b7\u00b7~04~~ ' , _\n..c. ...:.\nr'\" ... ..~.... wI'\\JI~\nt~,\n...,\n..\n.

It is a suggest.ive fact that the first line of the\nanswer was at a distance from the lower edge of the slate equal to\nthat to which the middle finger could reach without shifting the slate,\nwhile the thumb remained visible above the table. The other answers\nproduced during the SMnce were similarly spaced. Careful examina-\ntion of the slate also showed finger marks extending around it in a\nmanner to indicate that it had been horizontally revolved.\nFinally, as to the answer itself, \"It consists of Silica Albumina and\nLime,\" we find on reference to Webster's Dictionary, in the definition\nof the word idocrase the words, \"It consists of Silica, Alumina and\nLime.\" Mr. Eglinton had ample opportunity to consult the dictiona.ry,\nsince he left the room twice during the SMnCII, one of the times being\njust previous to the production of the above answer. Either he had\ntaken too hasty a glance at the dictionary, or his memory had failed\nhim in substituting albumina for alumina. We can hardly suppose a\n\" spirit\" to have made this error, or to have imitated the dictionary\ndefinition so closely.\nAlthough I am aware of some seven methods of mediumistic slate-\nwriting, the s()-C311ed \"psychography,\" only two of them, so far as I\ncould judge, were employed at this sMnce; and the main condition\nnecessary for success was that of non-attention on the part of the\nvisitor.\nSecond Seance.\nA second visit was made to Mr. Eglinton on the morning of\nDecember 16th, and, observing now the condition necessary for success,\nI had a very satisfactory sMnce. I took with me' two ordinary school-\nslates, purchased on the way. We sat down at the same table, the cloth\nhaving been removed, and proceeded at once to business.\nWe began with the experiment of the book and the slate, which I\nhad seen several times described.+ Mr. Eglinton having left the room,\n* Note the initial\" S\" and final \"8,\" the capital ..

It is also described in Light, October 16th,1886, by\nMr. Wedgwood (p. 463), Mr. Fanner and Mr. Ke11lemana (p. 4651, Miss\nSymons (p. 467), .. G. J.

Word 2 red, 3 white, 4 blue.\" I intended by this\nthat the second word of line 13, page 27, should be written on the slate\nin red chalk, the third word of the same line in white chalk, and the\nfourth word in blue. Having turned the slate upside down, I called to\nMr. Eglinton to come in. He entered, and having put three bits of\nchalk, red, white, and blue, with the book, on the slate, he put the\nwhole under the table, and, taking my left hand in his left, began the\nseance. My right hand being free I wrote the following notes as the\nseance proceeded :-\nMr. Eglinton places the book on the slate with the open aide\ntowMd him.* His thumb is not visible, his whole hand being under the\ntable. I purposely do not look directly at him, but busy myself with\nthese notes. The moment I begin writing, the manifestations begin.\nHe breathes heavily, sighs, moves and rattles the slate, puts his right\narm jOlT\" below the table, withdraws his body slightly backward, and\nthen looks downward mlently, in the direction of the slate. I suddenly\nlook up, and immediately he also looks up with a very distressed\nexpression of countenance. I look down at my notes, and again he\nlooks down intently and for some time,. apparently at what he is\nholding beneath the table. From the position of his arm, I judge that\nby this time he has lowered the slate to perhaps eight inches below the\ntable, e'\\len his elbow being sunk out of sight. He now jerks the slate\nseveral times, breathing loudly. I look up again, when he says that he\nis tired, a.nd brings up the book and slate, laying them on the table.\nThe pencils having been partly jerked oft\u00b7 the slate. fresh bits are put\nalongside the book, and the whole is again placed beneath the table.\nI continue my note-taking, and immediately loud breathing and\nshuddering begin on the part of Mr. Eglinton, who also assumes a\nmost woe\u00b7begone expression. He pushes his arm with the slate far\nunder the table, and then bringing it back towards him again looks\ndown (as if to read the book). He asks me if I am not conscious of a\nforce going out of me, and a feeling as if his hand was a battery.\nI am conscious of nothing of the kind. Now he brings the\nslate up against the under-side of the table, and puts his thumb\nabove, being the same position assumed at the tirst s~nce, when\nwriting was being produced on the slate. I now hear the sound of\nBoutlerof, and Dobroslavin of St. Petersbul'l (p. 474). \"M.A. (Oxon.)\" (p. (75),\nMr. I'Anson (p. 5(0), all of whom regard it as conclusive evidence of the\npnuineneas of ..psychography.\"\n* This appears to have been also the position of the book in the\nexperimenta described in Light.

Spiritualistic\" Seances.\nwriting, as if on the slate, and a few moments later he exhibits it to me\nwith the answer written as follows :-\" of\" in red, .. occult\" in white,\nand \"forces\" in blue. The book lies in the middle of the slate, the\npencils at one end, and the writing at the other. On turning to the\npage and line of the book indicated, I find the words \"of occult forces\"\nin the correct position, but on close examination find marks made by a\nfinger-nail in the margin precisely opposite these words. It is clear\nthat lOme power made thNe scratches with a finger-nail, apparently a\nthumb-nail, after opening the book and finding the place. I am astounded\nat the simplicity of a performance, which, as described, baa been 80\nstrongly tinged with the marvellous.\nThe second experiment baa also been described.* A piece of slate-\npencil was put on the slate and covered by a glass tumbler, when the\nwhole was placed under the table, 80 that the top of the tumbler rested.\nagainst the under-side of the table. Knowing how easy it would be to\nshove the slate along under the tumbler when so supported, I asked to\nbe allowed to hold one end of the alate under the table myself, which\nMr. Eglinton permitted me to do. I then asked to have the word\n\" Nottingham\" written, but on Mr. Eglinton saying that this word was\ntoe long, I chose\" dog.\" So soon as I looked away from Mr. Eglinton\nthe operations began. Holding the slate, I distinctly felt him tilt it,.\nshove it slightly along from under the tumbler, and then, in-\nclining his end downwards, write on its upper side. He also looked\ndown at the slate just before he wrote. The writing was hastily\ndone,and the slate then restored to a horizontal position,and shoved back\n80 that the glass should cover the word. The performance was now\nfinished, and the slate brought up for me to examine. The word .C dog\"\nwas indistinctly and badly written in an irregular scrawl beneath the\nglass. The writing was not nearly so distinct as that done in Mr.\nEglinton's usual method, when the slate is held against the table. (This\nwas, I suppose, due either to the unsteady position of the slate as com-\npared with its position when firmly pressed against the under-side of\nthe table, or else to want of practice on the part of the performer.)\nThe third experiment consisted of a question and answer written in\nthe ordinary way. I wrote \"Please give a quotation from Kant,\"\nthinking that Mr. Eglinton would probably have to consult a reference\nbook in order to answer it. He held the slate against the under-side of\nthe table, and I held his left hand with my left and with my right hand\nagain busied myself with these notes. He began at once to write,\nand in a few moments brought up the slate, on which the following\nanswer appeared: \"There is no spirit here who knows Kant well\n\u2022 Journal 01 the Society lor P61JcIIkal RuearcA, June, 1888, p. 324, uad\nLight, No. 302, p. 482.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fI.\n\u2022 Compare here on slate wi,h were in letter; there on slate with the in\nletter; who on IIlate with which aDd what in letter, &c. . ..

I\nbegged that it might be continued, as I was leaving London for the\nContinent the next day. He said that it was quite impossible to get\nfurther manifestations since the \"power was exhausted,\" and explained\nthat this exhaustion of power was quite independent of his Yolition, and\noccurred at various times, sometimes at the very beginning of a\nseance. The thought occurred to me that, notwithstanding this\n\" exhaustion of power,\" the spirits would perhaps continue to work if\nsome further inducement was offered to them. I therefore proposed to\nMr. Eglinton a double fee if the seance was prolonged. The medium\nyielded without hesitation, and the spirits continued to give excellent\nmanifestations. It was interesting to learn that these \"unknown\npowers\" are not removed from the influence of pecuniary inducements.\nWe proceeded to the fourth experiment. It was one which would\nbe difficult to perform without detection, and, moreover, since Mr.\nEglinton was ignorant of the answer to the question, a direct one\ncould not be given (unless by the agency of \"spirits\" or other\n\" intelligent forces \"). As I had come to Mr. Eglinton at first under\nan assumed name, and at the present seance under my proper one, he\nhad no means of knowing the correct answer to the question, which\nwas \"What is my father's name 1\" I wrote this question somewhat\nfaintly with a lead pencil on a sheet of note-paper, the left side of\nwhich was gummed to the left edge of a slate and then folded down so\nthat the question should be on the under side next to the slate. In\norder to see the question, Mr. Eglinton would have to lower the\nslate sufficiently to turn over the sheet of note-paper, thus:-\nr\nan operation which I could not\nfail to observe. It was arranged\nthat the answer should be written\nin pencil on the other side of the\nsame sheet of note-paper, and a\nminute bit of lead pencil, freshly\nsharpened, was laid on the slate\nfor the use of the\" spirits.\" All\nbeing thus arranged, and Mr.\nEglintonhaving sharpenedanother\npencil, he put the slate under the\ntable in the usual position, held my left hand in his left, and I began\nagain writing these notes, my head being partly turned away, yet not\nso far but that I could see his motions. I also moved somewhat out\nfrom the table so that I could watch his legs.\nThe conditions being, as he supposes, favourable, he proceeds to\nlower the slate 80 that his whole hand and arm up to the elbow dis-\nDigi\n\fAccounts of 80me So-called \"Spiritua1istic\" Seances. 365\nappear from view. I now distinctly hear the rustling of the paper as\nit is being folded back, This being done, Mr. Eglinton looks down\nintently towards his knees, apparently endeavouring to read my\nquestion, which I had purposely written in a small, light hand. Here\nhe drops the slate upon the floor. Having restored it to its original\nposition, the same operation is repeated, and again he 8toop8 to look at\nthe question, this time bringing his head within afew inche, of the\ntable. His left leg now 8lowly begin8 to rise and soon entirely\ndisappears from my view, as though to support the slate upon his knee.\nHis arm and whole hand are at the same time under the table. I now\nhear writing going on at some length. On my turning to look at him\nthe sound of writing ceases and the leg is let down. Again I look\naway, when writing recommences, his thumb now being visible and\nresting on the table. I watch his wrist and distinctly see the tendons\nmove as he is in the act of writing.\nMr. Eglinton seemed, therefore, to have written the last part of\nthe message while the slate was pressed against the under side of the\ntable, in the usual way; but before I interrupted him he had\napparently been writing upon the slate while it lay upon his knee. As\nwill be shown presently, the character of the writing leads to the same\nconclusion. The following answer now appeared, written as requested\non the paper :-\" We regret that your father's name is unknown to us.\nIf you had a deceased relative present who knew the name of your\nfather it is probable we could. We are not omniscient.\"\nAs in every other experiment in both seances the answer indicated\nflO superi<Jr inteUigence to that of Eglinton. It was interesting to find\ntwo distinct styles of handwriting upon the paper, a facsimile of\nwhich is here given [see Fig. 4, p. 366], corresponding to the two\npositions in which he wrote.\nFrom the beginning of the answer to the word \"could,\" the\nwriting is angular, the words and lines well spaced, the i's properly\ndotted, and there is every indication that it was written with the aid\nof the eye. The words \"probable we,\" written at right angles to the\npreceding portion of the answer after the slate had been turned, fill a.\nvacant space at the end of the first two lines in a manner that clearly\nproves the use of eyesight. But the last part of the answer, on the\nother end of the slate, is in quite a different hand and was written\nwith a fresh pencil point. It is irregular, the lines are no longer\nstraight, the i's are not dotted, m's are twice used instead of n's, and\nit was evidently written without the aid of the eye. A freshly pointed\npencil, or at least a new corner, must have been used to make the thin\nlines here, which differ markedly from the dull heavy lines of the preced-\ning portion. This last portion shows more clearly the characteristic\nhandwriting produced in former experiments, and it is suggested by\nDigi\n\f366 .Accounts of 80me So-called \"SpiritualiBtic\" Sianca.\nFIG. !.\nizedbyGoogle\n\fAccounts of some So-called \"SpiritUalistic\" Seances. 367\nthe writing alone that the last five words were written while the slate\nwas held against the under side of the table, and the preceding portion\nwhile it rested on his knee in sight. The handwriting of the whole\nanswer is clearly identical with that produced in the last experiment,\nas a direct comparison of Figs. 3 and 4 renders evident.\nAs Mr. Eglinton on this occasion did not ask me to examine the\npencil point, placed on the slate for the use of the spirits, but on the\nother hand was about to throw it away, I thought this an advantageous\nopportunity to examine it. I therefore quickly seized and pocketed it.\nIt proved to be perfectly sharp and unworn, and identical in size and\ncondition with what it was when placed on the slate before the experi-\nment. It had certainly not been used for the production of the\nanswer. The other short pencil which I had seen Mr. Eglinton sharpen\njust before the experiment was not shown to me, but it is not difficult\nto imagine its purpose. He assured me, however, that the writing\nwas produced by some external agency.\nMr. Eglinton now suggested telling me the number of matches in a.\nmatchbox that he held in his hand. Having seen a description of this\noperation, I declined participating in it. I also declined having him\ntell me the number of a bank-note that I was to put in his famous\nfolding-slate, divining his method. I asked, however, for one more\ntrial with his folding-slate, on condition that he left the room for a few\nminutes, to which he assented.\nWhile he was out of the room, I wrote a question upon a piece of\npaper and put it in the closed slate, which I not only locked, putting\nthe key in my pocket, but fastened together by glueing a poStage-\nstamp across the end, so that it would be impossible to open it without\nconsiderable force, and probably the use of two hands. Having called\nin Mr. Eglinton and got the slate under the table without his noticing\nthe stamp, which was on the edge of the slate farthest from him, I went\non with my writing, leaving him and the spirits to open the slate if\nthey could. I heard a slight tinkling sound as if he were using a dupli-\ncate key. After several minutes (in which Mr. Eglinton had probably\nbeen vainly endeavouring to open the slate), he brought it up, still with\nthe stamp upon it, and laid it upon the table. Then putting\u00b7a common\nslate below in the usual way, his whole hand being beneath the table,\nhe asked the spirits, \"Can we get an answer 1\" After putting the\nslate for a moment on top of the table, and then again placing it below,\nthe sound of writing was heard and immediately afterwards an answer\nappearedupon the simple slatein his hand, in the usual position, reading\n\"No. We have done all that we can for you.\"*\n\u2022 Had Mr. Eglinton been aware that tho slate had been fastened with &\npostage stamp, he might have removed it-to remove adhesive pa~r from a\nDigitized by ~oo8le\n\f368 Accounts of som.e So-called \"Spiritualistic\" Seances.\nThe question that I had placed in the folding-slate remained\nunanswered and untouched, and I was forced to conclude that a sealed\nslate as well as a sealed envelope, was proof against the skill of both\nMr. Eglinton and the\" spirits.\" Thus ended the second Mnce.\nAltogether nine distinct experiments were performed or attempted.\nIn reviewing these, it is possihle to summarize the principal facts\nobserved as follows :-\n1. Writing was never obtained on any of the slates unless they had\nbeen held for some time under the table.\n2. In every case where answers were obtained, Mr. Eglinton looked\ndown at the slate containing the question long enough to read it.\n3. Direct answers were given only in cases where Mr. Eglinton, after\nseeing the question, either knew the answer already or obtained it\nby consulting a dictionary. In the last case he left the room for\nseveral minutes before an answer was given.\n4. Whenever the question was unseen by Mr. Eglinton it was unseen\nby the\" spirits,\" and when the answer was unknown to him it was\nunknown to the \"spirits,\" as the written answers in each case\nproved. In no case was any intelligence other than that of Mr.\nEglinton indicated in the answers.\no. The movement of the tendons in Mr. Eglinton's wrist when the\nBOund of writing was heard, the rustling of the paper as it was\nbeing unfolded and refolded, and the motion of the slate felt as it\nwas tilted beneath a tumbler, are phenomena perceived by the\nsenses to be in accord with the ordinary laws of nature as applied\nto the action of Mr. Eglinton's right hand.\n6. The fragments of chalk or pencil placed on the slate do not appear\nto be neceBB8.ry for the production of an answer. As in one cue\nthe chalk was worn down too much, and in another case the pencil\nwas not worn down at all, notwithstanding a long answer, it\nappears that the abrasion on them often exhibited was purposely\nmade for other reasons.\n7. The scratching sound often heard beneath the table like the sound\nof writing, was certainly made by Mr. Eglinton, as the corre-\npolished wooden surface being perfectly easy-and, after opening the slate,\nreplaced the stamp u before. But being entirely unaware of the c&U8e of\nthe failure of the slate to fall open u usual by its own weight, he wu\nunable to do anything with it. I secretly removed the stamp before returning\nthe slate to Mr. Eglinton. who perhaps imagined that 1 had tampered with the\nlock. It is needless to remark that genuine \"spirits\" would hardly have been\ndeterred by a postage stamp, nor would they afterwards have given a totaUy\nirrelevant auawer. Thequestion\" By whose hand is the &DIIwer to this question\nwritten?\" can hardly be auawered by the sentence, .. No. We have done all\nthat we can for you.\"\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f.Accounts of 80me So-called .. Spiritualistic\" Seances. 369\nsponding motion of the tendons of his wrist proved. This\nscratching sound usually immediately preceded the exhibition\nof the answer, but there is no reason to suppose that\nit always had any connection with the actual writing upon\nthe slate. On the contrary, in one case the scratching lasted\ntoo long for the short answer, and in another case the scratching\nwas done under the table when no slate was there, the slates being\non top of the table and Mr. Eglinton's hand alone being below.\nLike the wearing down of the pencil, the sound of scratching\nappears to have been in many cases intended only for effect.\n8. The answers produced on each of the slates and on the paper\nhave similar characteristic points, and although more or less\ndisguised from the ordinary handwriting of Mr. Eglinton, a\ncareful comparison leads me to the conclusion that all were the\nwork of one hand.\n9. The position of the writing on the slates corresponded to the\ndistance to which Mr. Eglinton's fingers could reach from the edge\nof the table, and sometimes suggested that the slate had been\nhorizontally revolved.\n10. During almost every experiment the slate was either dropped on\nthe floor or brought up at least once to the tOp of the table,\nostensibly to rest the medium, butat the same time affording him\nopportunities for revolving the slate or otherwise manipulating it.\n11. In a case which required it, Mr. Eglinton appeared to support the\nslate upon his knee, and put both hand and arm beneath the\ntable, and in this case the character of the writing differs from\nthat produced when the slate is in the usual position supported\nagainst the table.\n12. In the experiment with the book and slate, the facts of his hand\nbeing completely under the table, his sightdirected towards it, and\nthe marks of a thumb-nail being afterwards found opposite the\nline chosen, afford evidence that the book was opened while under\nthe table.\n13. No results were obtained when the question was enclosed either in\na sealed envelope or a sealed slate.\n14. Nothing was done so long as a strict watch was kept upon Mr.\nEglinton, but non-attention was in each case immediately followed\nby manifestations. 1\n1 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick (Proceeding\" Part x., p. 70) has come to a very\nsiruila.r conclusion after lMIances with many mediums, and has shown that an\nabsence of evidence of continuous observation on the part of the witnesses, and\nof phenomena dispeusing with the necessity for nch observation, characterises\nspiritualistic manifesto.tions in general. . . r.

Pecuniary inducements were found to be capable of reviving aD\nasserted \"exhaustion of power.\"\nIt is not for me here to discuas what Mr. Eglinton's motives may be\nin exhibiting these manifestations and in assigning them to the opera-\ntion of forces external to himself. It is enough to have proved that.\nthe phenomena witnessed were all capable of being produced by his\nown right hlUld while hidden beneath the table; that no superior intel-\nligence or external force was at any time indicated; and that the one\ncondition necessary for success was non-attention on the part of the\nvisitor.

Netherclift's Report on the above\nfacsimiles :-\n10, Bedford-row, W.C.\n8f}\" March, 1887_\nI have very minutely compared the writings contained in the four\nseveral documents submitted to me for an opinion, namely: A facsimile\nof writing on a slate, commencing, \"There is no spirit here,\" &c., which\nI have marked 1.

FREDERICIt GEORGE NETBBRCLIPT.\nMr. Hodgson gives the following opinion on the writings:-\n1, Furnival's Inn, Holborn, E.C.\nMarcA 9t1&, 1887.\nI was unable to make any prolonged examination myself of the\nfacsimiles of the writings you wished to be submitted to Mr. Netherclift.\nThere was of course no doubt that all the writings might have been by\nthe hand of Eglinton, and I observed, during the short comparison\nwhich I made, several peculiar indications that they actually were\nwritten by him,-indicmtions which would probably escape the notice\nof the ordinary reader. And though the conclusion that Eglinton\nwrote them all would not be obvious at first sight, I think few would\nhesitate to agree with Mr. Netherclift after noting the pointa of\nresemblance which he has enumerated, and of which additional\nexamples may be found. There are other minor instances of resem-\nblance which Mr. Netherclift thought needless to mention, and I\nentirely agree with his opinion that all four writings are by the band\nof Eglinton. Concerning Mr. Netherclift's remark abo~t Eglinton's\nhabitual style of writing, it may be wortb mentioning that I have in\nmy possession a long letter written by Eglinton in 1882, and that\nit seems clear that he bas intentionally changed some of the characters\nof his ordinary handwriting; and further significant resemblances might\nbe pointed out between his undoubted writing of 1882, and the\n\" psychographic\" specimens under examination.\nRICHARD HODGSON.\nWhile this paper is passing through the press, Professor CarviU\nLewis sends the following Postscript to his account :-\nSince the above was in print, two articles have appeared in\nGermany describing s~nces with Mr. Eglinton, in both of which the\ninquirers express themselves as convinced of the \"supersensual\"\ncharacter of the manifestations.\nOne of the ~ces, held at St. Petersburg, is described by Herr\nJulius Gillis in an article entitled\" Sechs Experimente mit Eglinton\"\n(Sphinx, III., 16., p. 253, April, 1887). The\" six experiments\" were\nvery similar to those performed for me and alreadyAIlscribed; consist.\nDigitized by GOogle\n\fAccownts of 80me &-called \"Spiritualistic\" seances. 373\ning of answers to questions on a slate, writing on a slate a name\npreviously written upon a piece of paper and placed in the folding-\nslate, telling the number of a banknote also put in his folding slate, 1\nperforming the experiment of the book and the slate, &c. In all\nof these the slate and accessories were held beneath the table, and\nsince none of the answers evinced an intelligence beyond that of Mr.\nEglinton, the proceedings seem to have been practically a repetition\nof those done for me, the same methods being used, and the same\nconditions being required.\nHerr Gillis has fortunately published a photographic reproduction\nof one of the answers (see Fig. 5) which is valuable as evidence. The\n\" spirit\" had been asked to perform the experiment of tying a knot in\na stretched cord, which Slade had done for Professor Zollner, and after-\nwards for Herr Gillis and others. Whereupon the following writing\nwas produced on the slate.\nThe reader may find it convenient to have the contents in print :-\nMein lieber Herr,\nVor Jahrhunderten wuuten unsere Vorfahren diese Phenomene\nund hatten auch die Kraft, dieselben hervorzubringen. Jedoch durch den\nFortechritt der Welt in anderen Dingen Kiimmerte sich man weniger mehr\ntiber daa menschliche Schicksal; jedoch jetzt solIte man es mehr denn jeh.\nWir hoffen dau durch die Thataachen, welche wir Ihnen vorfiihrten, Sie\naich mehr and mehr mit diesem Gegenatand befauen werden.\nIhr ergebener\nERNEIIT.\nThe experiments which you demand would take a very long Beries of\nseances to accomplish, and we could under no circumstances promise them.\nIt will be observed (1) That the German portion of the answer is\ntotally irrelevant to the question, and had clearly been at least com-\nposed before the seance. (2) That the German itself is such bad\nGerman as an Englishman might write. \"Ernest,\" whoever he may\nbe, is clearly not an adept at German, else he would not have\nwritten \"wu88t6n\" for kannten, \"sich Ina'll\" for man sich, \"iiher \"\nfor Utn, \"jeh\" for je, \"durch die\" for in Veranlassung der, \"and\" for\nundo (3) That the two entirely different styles of writing, while\nexhibiting Mr. Eglinton's skill at disguising and varying his hand-\nwriting, still bear the characteristic marks of his personality. The\n\"report [see p. 376] from Mr. Netherclift, the well-known expert,\nto whom this facsimile was submitted, bears testimony to the truth\nof this conclusion.\nThe other article, also founded upon a seance with Mr. Eglinton, is\na very well-written one entitled, \"Ein Wort iiber den Spiritismus\"\n1 I have already stated that Eglinton proposed to perform this \" ex-\nperiment\" with me, but that I had declined it, suspecting his pro~ I\nDigitized by ~008 e\n\f374 Accottnts of BOme So-called \"Spiritualutic\" Siances.\nFIG. 5.\nDigitized by Coog[e\n\fAcCO\"Unts of some So-called\" Spirit'UOlistic\" Seances. 375\n. ,\/\n(,Vom Fela 2Um Meer, VI., Hept 8, p. 264), by Baron Dr. Carl du Pre!,\nof Munich, one of the ablest writers upon the subject, himself an earnest\nbut liberal-minded Spiritualist. He describes how, after two unsuccess-\nful seances, at the third seance, seven persons besides the medium being\npresent, all of whom were now sympathetic and\" well-wishing\" toward\nhim, the favourite experiment of the book and slate, at Mr. Eglinton'.\nsuggestion, was performed. As the performance was slightly varied\nfrom his usual manner, it may be well here brie6y to describe it.\nAll being seated around the table, with joined hands, and a book\nhaving been brought in, a page, line, and number were privately written\non a slate hy one of the company, the book placed upon the slate, and\nall put beneath the table, one of the ladies assisting the medium in\nsupporting the slate at one end against the under side of the table.\nAfter being held beneath the table for a long time it was finally brought\nup, and a second slate was laid on top of the book, when all was tied\ntogether and again held under the table. Soon the sound of writing\nwas heard, and, three knocks being given, the slates were separated and\nthis writing found: \"Page 176, litle 18, word 6, Grahltilgel,\" which\nlast, on opening the book, was found to be the correct word.\nBaron e1u Prel regards this production as due to the action of an\nintelligent, invisible, clairvoyant spirit, which, as indicated by its\ndegree of intelligence, was neither an angel nor a demon, but the spirit\nof a deceased human being. He seems to consider that it is phenomena\nof this nature which form the true acientific baaia of Spiritualism. I\nquite agree with Baron du Prel, when, near the close of his article, he\nsays, \"Unless there is in the first place a scientific foundation for\nSpiritualism, any Spiritualistic code of morals' floats in the air.' Before\nwe can pin our faith upon the sayings of spirits, we must know beyond\na doubt who these spirits are who declare them.\"\nIf the scientific basis of Spiritualism consists of the so-called\nmanifestations produced by such men as Mr. Eglinton, or in any facts\nof a similar nature, it is no wonder that most men of science refuse to\nhave anything to do with it. The experiment just described in no\nway invalidates the presumption that Mr. Eglinton opened the book\nand wrote upon the slate while they were under the table. The state-\nment of the lady who held one end of the slate that it had not\nbeen moved, while said with perfect sincerity, is without value, for as\nI have proved by repeated experiments, it is almost impossible to\ndetect the gradual lowering of the other end of the slate for a few\ninches when held in this position. Anyone can readily verify this point\nfor himself.\nH. CABVILL LEWIs.\nApril, 1887.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f376 Accounts of 80me So-called \"Spiritualistic\" Beancea.\nMr. Netherclift's report is as follows ;-\nI have attentively examined the reduced lithographed copy of slate-\nwriting, and have compared the same with the admitted habitual hand-\nwritings of Mr. Eglinton, with which I am now becoming quite famili!U\".\nI am enabled to give you the following very decided opinion as to\nthe genuineness of the slate-writing in question.\nI do not understand German as a language, but I am acquainW\nwith the manner of writing it, having had, in the course of forty\nyears' experience as an expert, to give evidence as to the formation\nof the letters so as to identify them with other hands submitted to me.\nThe slate-writing now before me is not written by a foreigner. It\nis undoubtedly an English handwriting, not German..\nThe whole of the writing, German and English, is by one and the\nsame hand, being undoubtedly the disguised hand of Mr. Eglinton.\nThe English writing is disguised in a more upright style than the\nGerman, so as to give a greater contrast, and to convey the notion of &\ndistinct hand; but the characteristics are similar throughout,and when\ncompared with Eglinton's natural hand the same writer is at once\nidentified.\nThus, for instance, compare the letter \"w,\" which in Eglinton's\nnatural handwriting is peculiar, and I have called attention to it in a\nfonner report [po 371]. This is the shape of it, \" i.A\".\" The first por-\ntion of the letter is made full, and round at the bottom, but the final\nportion is like the letter \"v,\" coming to a point, thus, \"1'.\" Noticethe\nword \"were\" in the 9th line of his letter of November 17th [po 359].\nand see how the \"w \" agrees with that in \"welche,\" 12th line German\nwriting. Also in \"wir\" and\" werden.\" In the English writing you\nwill see it in \"which,\" 1st line, and \"would,\" 2nd line. In fact,\nEglinton cannot guard against this formation, and betrays it in every\ndisguised hand, whatever the style.\nThen, again, his writing is recognised by the final \" d \" with looped\ndownstroke, thus\" \/.\" See \"and\" in the German writing, 14th\nline, and \"would\" and \"and\" in the English writing, and compare them\nwith the \"d\" in the word\" behind,\" 6th line, letter of November 17th\n[po 359]. This habit also runs through all Eglinton's disguised hand-\nwritings.\nThe word \"to\" may always be recognised. The~ is no word \"to\"\nin the German writing, but that in the 4th line of the English writing\nresembles precisely Eglinton's formation. A peculiarity shown\noccasionally in the formation of the word\" to\" will be alluded to in my\nnext report, when, in connection with the dis21lisechwritinas on the\nDigitized by l::.oogre\n\fAccounts of Benne So-called \"Spiritualistic\" Seances. 377\nthree slates, Eglinton's eccentricities in writing will more fully be\nentered into. 1 I will now mention only the three ways in which\nEglinton forms the letter\" r.\" These three formations will be found\nthroughout the disguised writings.\nFRBDERICK GBORGB NBTHBRCLIFT.\nIn the following case the evidence for trickery is of a different kind.\nACCOUNT FROM MR. B. J. PADSHAH,\nOf Sind College, Kurrachee, India.\nSeptem1JeJr 14th, 181!6.\nliB Mr. Eglinton is very aggressive in dealing with Mrs. Sidgwick's\nreport on his phenomena., I feel bound to entrust to Mr. Hodgson\nfor pUblication whenever he thinks it necessary, the following facts,\nwhich can be easily confirmed by referring to the individuals named.\nMr. Khareghat, of the Indian Civil Service (address, Treasury,\nAhmedabad, India,) and myself were having sittings with Mr.\nEglinton in the last quarter of 1884, when, to see how far he can\ndegrade himself in trickery, I resorted to a dodge at the suggestion\nof a third friend. The point of our previous sittings with Mr.\nEglinton was this: that while the reverse of incredulous of his\npowers, we wished for some confirmation of them by getting some\nGujarati writing; and if something concerning our family affairs, so\nmuch the better, as we felt assured that Mr. Eglinton was ignorant\nof our language probably, and certainly of our domestic affairs.\nMr. Eglinton had favoured us with three or four phenomena but none\nsatisfied our conditions. Once, indeed, we had two lines of Sanskrit\nwritten in Bengali characters in the course of a somewhat trashy\ndissertation in English; but as Mr. Eglinton had been for six months\nin Bengal, and as he had contrived, very much against our wish,\nand I may say, to my disgust, to get one whole hour's preparation\nprevious to our seance, the significance of the writing was\nminimised. At the instance of a third friend, therefore, and\nimproving, as I thought, and as it turned out, upon such suggestions\nas were made to me by that friend and others, I wrote out in\nGujarati a common song of Bombay and translated it into English;\nthe translation and the superscription of the envelope being written\nby Mr. Mohini M. Chatterji, (77, Elgin Crescent, Notting Hill,)\n1 This refers to three other slates-full of writing-the result of sittings\nwith Eglinton-which were lent to us by a friend. In framing the present\nreport and the one referred to, Mr. Netherclift had before him, as specimens\nof Eglinton's admitted handwriting, two short notes and two envelopes, in\naddition to Figure 2.-E.G.\nizedbyGoogle\n\f378 Acco'U(nt8 of 80me So-called .. Spiritualist-i.e\" Siance8.\nand forwarded it to Mr. Eglinton. The original suggestion was that\nI should write only a line or two of Gujarati and send that to\nMr. Eglinton without comment or translation. One advantage of\nthat is obvious. It gives the trickster less trouble to imitate or\ntrace, and therefore less chances of detection, and therefore greater\ntemptation. But I feared lest Mr. Eglinton should think what\nreason any anonymous correspondent could have to send him\nGujarati lines without telling him what he was to do with them, and,\nlest he should suspect a trap was laid for him (which, I am afraid,\nhe must have done in any case,) I sent it, therefore, as a \"Spiritual\nSong by an Indian (Guj) Bard,\" and translated it line by line,\nliterally, to allow him to make use of as much of it as he liked.\nI, therefore, had some chance of giving him the impression that an\nanonymous Gujarati, finding from the papers that he (Mr. Eglinton)\nwas the pillar of Western Spiritualism, had sent him an Eastern\neffusion for his use on a subject of such interest to him. I also took\nthe opportunity of absenting myself from the sitting which Mr.\nKharE'ghat alone had on a Saturday (I think Nm'emhE'r 3rd, 1884), by\ngoing to LivE'rpool with Madame Blavatsky, to see her oft' to India.\n~Iy friend Mr. Khareghat was not admitted to the knowledge of what\nwe had done, and I\\S I WI\\8 not present there was nothing in the sitting to\nencourage Mr. Eglinton to hE'lieve in the trap. When I returned\nwhat was my surprise when I saw my own handwriting on the slate.\nand every line of Gujarati as I had written it on the paper. I\nconfess I became uneasy lest my friend should believe I had wished\nhim to be deluded for my own purposes, and thus terminate the\nlifelong friendship and confidence between us. But that honourable\nsoul only was surprised at the formE'd hand betrayed in the writing,\nand as he was not familiar with my Gujarati writing (we in India\ncorrespond mostly in English,) he, I hope, took my word that the\nthing was not genuine. I am certain that the writing was mine, and\nit must have been traced on the slate. The slate, I believe, is\npreserved by Mr. Khareghat in India, and it would be possible,\nperhaps, to ascertain whether the writing there bears marks of\nhaving been traced or not. My mother, (198, Main Road, KhetvRdi,\nBombay,) can furnish samples of my Gujarati writing in the shape\nof recent letters to her, and thus my statement about the identity\nof the writing can be verified. I do not append a sample of\nmy writing now for the reason that it will not be quite natural,\nwhile my mother can furnish letters contemporaneous with the &nC8.\nEvery item of this can be -verified by reference to the people\nmentioned, and also to Mi88 Arundale, (77, Elgin Crescent, Notting\nHill,) who was in knowledge of the whole thing.\nLastly, I may say that I sometimes have an un,aBY COIlflCi01l8Deu\nDigitized by ~0081e\n\fACCO'U1Us of som.e So-called .. Spiritualistic\" Seances. 379\nthat Mr. Eglinton may have known all along that we wished him\n-to trick Mr. Khareghat, and may have misunderstood my object.\nIf so he is at least guilty of complicity in a plot whose fruit\nhe was very ready to make use of, for he has since begged Mr.\nKhareghat to give him an account of his impressions of the seances\nwith a view to make a public use of it. What is the reliance, then,\nto be placed on the Eglinton-Blavatsky phenomenon on the Vega,\nif he convicts himself of such complicity 1\nA theory was once suggested to me that Mr. Eglinton's astral\nbody, or double, or any other concoction, might have precipitated the\nidentical writing on the slate with or without the assistance of spooks.\nIt was supposed a confirmation rather than the reverse, that the\nmatter and the hand were identical with the copy I had sent to\nMr. Eglinton. Mr. Egliuton, along with his double, it was pointed\nout, must have intensely studied that writing, and hence floating in\nhis \"astral aura,\" the double could not help reading and precipitating\nit. If anyone can make anything of and accept such a hypothesis,\nit is his affair. My point is that we had got no test previously; that\nwhen a deliberate trap had been laid, Mr. Eglinton seemed to have\nfallen into it; that Gujarati writing came only once, and that was\nafter we had sent him a specimen; and in substance, and style,\nand handwriting it was to all appearance identical with our\n.specimen. It is worthy of note that during that seance, lasting over\nmore than thirty minutes, Mr. Khareghat received no other message,\n~xcept perhaps the final and very convenient \"good-bye.\"\nB. J. PADSHAH.\nNovember 27th, 1~86.\nI believe Mr. Hodgson will be able to testify to these facts himself\nfrom some independent evidence he obtained of the facts from the\nprincipal parties within six months of the 6vent.-B. J. P.\nMr. Hodgson writes :-\nI can corroborate the essential points of the above account, having\nheard of the incident originally from Madame Blavatsky, whose\nnarrative to me was confirmed by the statements afterwards made to\nme by Miss Arundale. Madame Blavatsky imposed secrecy upon\nnlyself, but she apparently thought it would be necessary to make use\nof my testimony at some time or other; and I have now no hesitation\nin confirming Mr. Padshah's account. RICHARD HODGSON.\nWith such evidence before us, supplementing that to which I\nbriefly referred, we must clearly regard Eglinton as a person who,\nbeing professionally interested in making it appear that certain\nphenomena. occur in his presence without his physical ageJ\\Cf, has po\nDigitized by ~oo8le\n\f380 .Accov.ntB of some So-called \"Spiritualistic\" Siatnces.\nscruples as to the means by which that appearance may be produced.\nBut to say that the medium is capable of trickery is, of course, quite\na different thing from saying that all his performances are tricks.\nIf the phenomena which occurred in his presence were far and away\nbeyond any conjurer's power of repetition, it might be possible to\naccept them as genuine, irrespective of his character. Here, then,\nwe come to the final and cri~cal question-Are any of the phenomena\nrecorded beyond the ascertained resources of conjuring' Has the\nobservation and attention exercised by the sitters been of a sort which\nconjurers are unable to distract or elude' Practical answers to such\nquestions as these have been attempted, but have generally consisted\nin imitations, given at public entertainments, of Spiritualistic\nphenomena-imitations often very imperfect and which at the best.\nleave it open to Spiritualists to say that things occurring in a\nprepared place, with any amount of opportunity for mechanical con-\ntrivances,bearno real resemblance to things occurring in private houses\nwhich the medium had never before entered, and in which he had had\nno opportunities for preparation. The dispute on such ground as this\nmight have been interminable. Noris it enough that certain conjurers\nshould testify that they have not been able to detect the mod\", operandi\nof mediums. For conjurers would scarcely profess to an infallible\nintuition of one another's processes and inventions; and in some ways,\nperhaps, technical knowledge, with the confidence that it begets, may\nbe a condition not wholly conducive to sound conclusions. Expertness\nin conjuring is of course no guarantee whatever of scientific habits of\nthought; and the expert who comes to a BeamS with his preconceived\nideas, and who finds that the solution of the puzzle dOes not lie in the\ndirection which he had pictured as the probable one, may jump more\nquickly than another to the certainty that no natural solution\nis poBSible. Something more, then, and something different is needed.\nWe must seek to ascertain by definite experiment, wMt Bort of rtJPO'TtB\nhonest and intelligent persons will make of conjuring performances\ncarried out in private, without any advantage of conditions, and\ndirected to obtaining results as closely as possible resembling those on\nwhich Spiritualists rely. If such reports of a conjurer's slate-writing\nprove to agree, both in general character and in special details,\nwith the reports by which the hypothesis of occult powers in Eglinton's\ncase has been supported, that hypothesis falls to the ground; for no\none probably will maintain the occult character of events which\noccur in a detected trickster's presence, whBn unable to name any.\npoint by which they can be distinguished from tricks. The reader will\nfind this subject amply argued and illustrated in the following paper,\nwhich I may perhaps be excused for describing as an original and\nvaluable chapter in the Natural History of Error.

R.\nWallace has said :-\nThey have all, or nearly all, been before the world for 20 years; the\ntheories and explanations of reviewers and critics do not touch them, or in any\nway satisfy any sane man who has repeatedly witneBBed them ; they have\nbeen tested and examined by sceptics of every grade of incredulity, men in\n~very way qualified to detect imposture or todiscovernatural cau_trained\nphysicists, medical men, lawyers, and men of businesa-},ut in every case the\ninvestigators have either retired hamed, or become converts. (Mimcl8B and\nModenl Bpirit-ualism, pp. 202, 203.)\nIt baa indeed been considered by perhaps the majority of\nSpiritualists, not only that the recorded testimony to these physical\nphenomena is enough to establish their genuineness, but that any\nhonest investigator might establish their genuinene88 to his own satis-\nfaction by personal experience. I agreed in a great measure with this\nopinion when, some ten years ago, I attended my first seance; but\nhitherto my personal experiences, though not by any means extensive,\nhave been almost precisely of the same nature as Mrs. Sidgwick's\n(Proceeding', Part X., pp. 45, 46); the physical phenomena which I\nhave witnessed were either clearly ascertained by my friends and myself\nto be fraudulent, or they were inconclusive and accompanied by circum-\nstances which strongly suggested trickery. I regarded this result\nmerely as negative, since I had learnt early in my investigation that\nspurious manifestations were undoubtedly often produced by professed\nmediums; and three years ago I was still under the impreBSion that a\nlarge mass of reliable testimony existed, adequate to establish the\ngenuineness of at least some of the commoner forms of physical pheno-\nmena, and especially of \"psychography,\"-that is writing without any\noperation of the medium's muscles. This was also quite recently\n1 Parts both of Mr. Davey's article and of Mr. Hodgson's introdllction have\nappeared in the Journal of the S.P.R.\nS See Procudingll, Part X., p. 45.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f382 The POBSibilitia of Mal-Observation, tl:c.\nthe opinion of Mr. C. C. Massey, who says (Procuding., Part X.p\np.98):-\nBut original reeearch is not neceaa.ry in the tint inltance. Mmy, of\nwhom I am one, are of an opinion that the cue for these phenomena generally,\nand for II autography II 1 in particular, is already complete.\nI have long since concluded that I estimated this testimony much\ntoo highly. When, in June, 1884, after reading BOme accounta of\n\"psychography,\" I had a sitting with Eglinton for\" slate-writing,\" I\nfully expected to witneaa phenomena that should be as indubitably\nbeyond the suggestion of trickery as those appeared to be of which I\nhad read and heard descriptions. Writing was produced at my first.\n\"slate-writing\" Bitting with Eglinton, to which I was accompanied by\nMr. R. W. Hogg; but Mr. Hogg and myself were both independently\nof opinion that Eglinton produced the writing himself without the\nintervention of any extraordinary agency. In writing our detailed\nreport of the sitting, we appreciatal, as we had never done before, the\ndifficulties of observation and of recollection,difficultieswhich we theught.\nmust almoat effectually prevent a full and accurate description from\nbeing given of events analogous to those which we attempted to record.\nOur report, and the reports of varioUl other sitters with Eglinton, moat\nof whom were, however, convinced of the genuineneBB of Eglinton'&\nphenomena, were printed in the Jourfl4l of the S.P.R. for June, 1886,\nwith BOme explanations and criticisms by Mrs. Sidgwick, who drew\nattention to two of the incidents in his career \"which show Ulat we\nmust not aaaume any disinclination on his part to paaa off conjuring\nperformances as occult phenomena.\" i Mrs. Sidgwick, who had\npreviously had the advantage of witneSBing BOrne of Mr. Davey's per-\nformances, and comparing her reports with those of another witneBB,\nand who had therefore been able to form BOme practical estimate\nof the frailty of human perception and memory under the peculiar\ncircumstances involved, expreaaed her opinion that the phenomena\nrecerded in the accounts as having occurred in the presence of\nEglinton were attributable to \"clever conjuring.\"\nIn the meantime, in the course of a visit to India for the\npurpose of investigating the \" Theosophical\" phenomena of\nMadame Blavatsky, I had had a BOmewhat considerable and varied\nexperience in comparing the testimonies of numerous bond fide\nwitneaaea to events belonging to the claaa of conjuring performances.\nThe moat instructive to me in the first instance were the different\naccounts which I heard from eye-witne88eB of the tricks of the Hindco\njugglers. I saw many of these performances, and saw them\n1 A word proposed 8.11 a substitute for\" psychography.\"\nI See the previous article, p. 350.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fI ntrod'UCtion. 383\nfrequently, and having learnt secretly from the jugglers them-\nselves how they were done, I was thereafter in a position to-\ncompare the accounts of them with the actual occurrences, and I was\nsurprised exceedingly to find to what extent they were misdescribed by\nintelligent spectators who were unaware of the modus operandi of the\ntricks. With the advantage of this experience, I studied in minute\ndetail the testimony to Eglinton's phenomena recorded in the Journal\nfor June, and found that if only the same kinds of misdescription\nwere allowed for in these reports as I had known to be honestly\ndisplayed by equally intelligent witnesses, the phenomena were\nperfectly explicable by conjuring. Not only was this the case, but\nthere were many little incidents mentioped, for the most part in-\nnocentlyand almost casually, in the reports, which afforded indications\nthat if Eglinton's performances were not conjuring, they were very\ncuriously adapted to resemble conjuring operations. And when to-\nthese facts, besides the clear evidence of Eglinton's previous imposture,\nwas added the further fact, emphatically pointed out by Mrs. Sidgwick,\nthat every experiment with Eglinton so devised and carried out as\napparently to exclude the possibilities of trickery by dispensing with the\nnecessity for continuous observation, had failed,I-there could, I\nthought, be little doubt, in the minds of rational and impartial in-\nquirers, of the justice of the conclusion which Mrs. Sidgwick had\nreached.\nBut this was not the case. Correspondence and controversy made it\nclear that the ordinary reader did hesitate to agree with Mrs. Sidgwick,\nand it SOOB became manifest that a common but erroneous assumption\nprevailed concerning the reliability of human testimony under the\npeculiar circumstances at issue. It appeared that a large number of the\nreaders of Mrs. Sidgwick's article in the Journal for June were preju.\ndiced in favour of ordinary'human powers of observation and recollec-\ntion under-it is to be remembered-exceptionally adverse circum-\nstances; and that they were thus prejudiced simply because they had\nnever made any special experiments,with the view ofascertainingexactly\nhow much reliance could be placed upon the reports of even acute\nand intelligent observers of the \"slate-writing\" performances of a con-\njurer known as such. They had decided apriori as to the capa.city\nof human perception and memory under quite peculiar conditions, and\nmost of them, I venture to say, had thus decided, not only without\npossessing any familiarity with the various modes of producing\" slate\u00b7\nwriting\" by conjuring, but without possessing any familiarity with con-\njuring tricks in general, and without being aware of the extent to\nI For the discu88ion of this point see Proceedings, X., pp. 70\u00b72, Journal\nfor June, 1886, pp. 332, 333, Journal for November, 1886, pp. 458\u00b760, Journal\nfor December, 18116, pp\u2022\u202275 and .a1\u00b785.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f384 The P08sibilitiu of Mal-Observation, J:c.\nwhich we are all subject to illusiom of M6fT&O'I\"1j, which, in relation to\nthe reports of \"psychography,\" are more deserving of consideration\nthan even illusions of Perception.\nIt seemed desirable, therefore, to carry out a somewhat more\nsystematic investigation than had heretofore beenattetnpted,-to provide\nthe ordinary reader with the opportunity of comparing for himself the\nrecords given of conjuring performances by the uninitiated, with the\ntestimony offered for the genuineness of mediumistic phenomena. To\nthe accomplishment of this task Mr. S. J. Davey has given much\nvaluable labour, as the sequel abundantly shows. This, however, was\nnot enough. It is obvious, of course, that any report is worthless for\nproving occult agency if a similar report by an equally competent\nwitness is given of what is known to be a conjuring trick. But this\nin itself would not enable us to estimate the true worth of testimony\nin such cases; on the contrary, it mightjust as well lead to a new and\nirrational faith in the unlimited capacity of conjuring. No doubt there\nare special \"dodges,\" unique wonders of workmanship, staggering\nllashes of well-nigh incredible dexterity, for which we must always\nleave ample margin in any pronouncement upon the limitations of a\nconjurer. Still, with all this, and after the largest allowances have\nbeen made for the possibilities of simple failure to observe, it will be\nadmitted that there are numerous records of \"psychographic\u00bb\nphenomena that have occurred with mediums (and also with Mr.\nDavey), which, (II described, are inexplicable by trickery. It was of\nthe utmost importance, therefore, to determine how far such records\nmight be misdescriptions, and what were the chief causes of th';\nmisdescriptions. In the course of a paper contributed to the JaurnoJ,\nI urged that the principal cause of misdescription, apart from mal-\nobservation, was the untrustworthiness of memory, and I endeavoured\nto classify roughly the main forms into which the errors of recollection\nfell. That students of mental science like Mr. Roden Noel and Mr.\nMassey should put aside so easily the considerations which I alleged\nwith respect to the treachery of memory, suggests that these considera-\ntions had, in all probability, been absolutely unheeded by the ordinary\nrecorder, unfamiliar with the more delicate processes of introspective\ndiscrimination. And alth&ugh in the Jowrnall felt it almost needful\nto apologise for my exposition of the lapses to which we are all liable,\non the ground that they had been \" almost entirely overlooked by the\nantagonists of Mrs. Sidgwick's view,\" the result has shown, not only\nthat they had been entirely overlooked in the degree to which I urged\nthem, but that the most eminent defenders of mediumistic phenomena\nrefused to admit their validity or their significance. But my warrant\nfor the importance of these considerations was much more than the\nexperience of my own lapses in recording, confirmed as that was by the\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fIntroduction. 385\ndiscovery of radical discrepancies between independent reports of one\nand the same Rance, in the cases where such independent reports were\ngiven of sittings with Eglinton; nor was it restricted to the\nlessons which I bad learnt by a comparison of oral and written accounts\nof common conjuring tricks with my knowledge of the real events; my\nwarrant consisted further in the fact that all the forms of error to which\nI alluded are actually embodied in the reports of Mr. Davey'S perform-\nances. In repeating these considerations here, then, I desire the\nreader to bear in mind that they are not vague theoretical speCUlations\nas to possibilities which have rarely if ever been realised, but\u00b7 warnings\nagainst veritable pitfalls which are dangerous even to the most wary\ninvestigator, into which Mr. Davey's sitters demonstrably fell, and\nEglinton's sitters also demonstrably, in the cases which admitted of\ndirect ascertainment.\nI shall first recount an incident which occurred in connection with\na Hindoo juggler's performance unconnected with Spiritualism, and\nwhich produced a deep impression upon myself at the time.\n. The juggler was sitting upon the ground immediately in front of\nthe hotel, with his feet crossed. Two small carved wooden figures were\nresting on the ground, about two feet distant from the juggler. Some\ncoins were also lying on the ground near the figures. The juggler\nbegan talking to the figures, which moved at intervals, bowing,\n\"kissing,\" and bumping against each other. The coins also began to\nmove, and one of them apparently sprang from the ground and struck\none of the figures. An officer and his wife, who had but recently\narrived at the hotel, were spectators with myself, and we stood\nprobably within two yards' distance of the juggler. I knew how the\ntrick was performed; they did not know. The officer drew a coin\nfrom his pocket, and asked the juggler if this coin would also jump.\nThe juggler replied in the affirma.tive, and the coin was then placed\nnear the others on the ground, after which it betrayed the same\npropensity to gymnastic feats as the juggler's own coins. Two or three\nother travellers were present at dinner in the evening of the same day,\nand in the course of the conversation the officer described the\nmarvellous trick which he had witnessed in the afternoon. Referring\nto the movements of the coins, he said that he had taken a coin from\nhis own pocket and placed it on the ground himself, yet that this coin\nhad indulged in the same freaks as the other coins. His wife ventured\nto suggest that the juggler bad taken the coin and placed it on the\nground, but the officer was emphatic ill repeating his statement, and\nappealed to me for confirmation. He was, however, mistaken. I had\nwatched the transaction with special curiosity, as I knew what was\nnecessary for the performance of the trick. The officer had apparently\nintended to place the coin upon the ground himself, but as he was\nDigitized by ~@o8Ie ....\n\f386 The PoBBibilitia of Mal-Observation, cI:c.\ndoing 80, the juggler leant slightly forward, dexterously and in a most\nunobtrusive manner received the coin from the fingers of the officer as\nthe latter was stooping down, and laid it close to the others. If the\njuggler had not thus taken the coin, but had allowed the officer himself\nto place it on the ground, the trick, as actually performed, would have\nbeen frustrated.\nNow I think it highly improbable that the movement of the\njuggler entirely escaped the perception of the officer-highly\nimprobable, that is to say, that the officer was absolutely unaware\nof the juggler's action at the moment of its happening; but I suppose\nthat although an impression was made upon his consciousness, it was\n80 slight as to be speedily effaced by the officer's imaginatitm of himself\nas stooping and placing the coin upon the ground. The officer, I may\nsay, had obtained no insight into the modUlI operandi of the trick, and\nhis fundamental misrepresentation of the only patent occurrence that\nmight have given him a clue to its performance debarred him com-\npletely from afterwards, in reflection, arriving at any explanation.\nJustsiJpiIarly, many an honest witness may have described himself as\nhaving placed one slate upon another at a sitting with a II medium,\"\nwhereas it was the medium who did 80, and who possibly effected at\nthe same time one or two other operations altogether unnoticed by the\nwitness.1\nNow it is the universal mental weakness of which the above\nincident is an illustration, that forms one of the main 80urces of error\nin the reports of II psychography.\" There are, of course, other sources\nof error, such as the direct illusions of perception Caused by mechanical\ncontrivances or the dexterity of the medium or the dominant expectations\nof the witness; there is also notably the distraction of the sitter's\nattention to such an extent that he is not aware at all of certain actions\nperformed by the medium, but this often results in positive\nmisdescription owing to the weakness of memory ; as Mrs. Sidgwick\nremarks (JO'UIfflal for June, 1886), \"we are liable not only to allow\nour attention to be distracted, but to forget immediately that it has\nbeen distracted, or that the event which distracted it ever occurred H j\nand the source of error which I desire in particular to press upon the\nreader's notice is the perishability, the exceeding transienee, the fading\nfeebleness, the evanescence beyond recall, of certain impressions which\nnevertheless did enter the domain of consciousness, and did in their due\nplace form part of the stream of impetuous waking thought. \/I\nIt is, moreover, not simply and merely that many events, which did\nobtain at the sitting some share of perception, thus lapse completely\nfrom the realm of ordinary recollection. The consequence may indeed\n1For aD example see SITTING II, Note 7. p.4117.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fIntroduction. 387\nbe that we meet with a blank or a chaos in traversing the particular\nfield of remembrance from which the events have lapsed; 1 but this\nwill often be filled by some conjectured events which rapidly become\nattached to the adjacent parts, and form, in conjunction with them, a\nconsolidated but fallacious fragment in memory.s On the other hand,\nthe consequence may be that the edges of the lacunm close up-events\noriginally separated by a considerable interval are now remembered\nvividly in immediate juxtaposition, and there is no trace of the\npiecing.S\nAnother source of error which bears a kinship to this depends\nsometimes upon the absence of a prolonged carefulness in writing out\nthe original record of the sitting. Events which occurred during the\nsitting, which made a comparatively deep impression, which had not,\nat the time of recording, sunk beyond the possibility of recall, never-\ntheless do not appear in the report, because they were temporMil'IJ\nforgotten; and having been thus omitted, the temporary forgetfulness\nis likely to become permanent, owing to the very coherence given to\nthe defective account by the recording.4\nLast September I spent many hours recalling and writing notes of\na slate-writing sMnce. The task occupied me some six or seven con-\ntinuous hours on each of the two days following the evening of the\nseance. Taking the first page' of my M88., I find, among what are\nplainly interpolations \/I after the page was originally completed, an\nexceedingly noteworthy passage.\nI bad held the slate against the table instantaneously after the\n\" conjurer\" had placed it in position; the slate was shortly afterwards\nwithdrawn, and the chalk which had been placed upon it was found\ncru\"hed. The chalk marks were cleaned oft'. A second time I held\nit similarly, and on withdrawal a dash was found on the slate, which\nwas again cleaned. After noting these and other directly connected\neyents, I had originally written, placing the occurrence before the pro-\nduction of writing: \"He then iumed the slate over, and put the nib\nof chalk on, and asked me to hold.\" My alteration of this reads :\n1 Partial omi88i0n.

After holding BOme time, he asked me to put my holding hand upon\nhis other holding B.'s, BO as to complete circuit. With this exception\nI held the slate in each case against the table. Later, he asked me to\nhold again.\" I had nearly omitted this most important exceptional\ncircumstance here described, correctly described-as I have since\nlearnt from the .. conjurer.\" I may further notice that it occurred\nbefore the first writing was obtained, as I rightly placed it. The\n\" conjurer\" did tum the slate over as I originally wrote, on three sub-\nsequent occasions during the sitting, but he did not do BO previous to\nthe appearance of the first writing. My temporary forgetfulner.s thus\ninvolved the temporary insertion of a conjectured event. Or, since the\nevent thus inserted did actually occur later in the litting, the insertion\nof it in the wrong place may be regarded as an illustration of the ten-\ndency to transposition, tic? which Mr. Angelo J. Lewis has also drawn\nattention (Journal for August, p. 362), in referring to the difficulty of re-\ncalling in their proper order such events as those in question; it is almost\nimpossible to avoid confusing the sequence if the events are crowded,\neven if they appeared at the time of their occurrence to be of special\nimportance.1\nIn addition to the mistakes which thus originate from the lapsing\nof certain events beyond recollection, there is the further mistake to\nwhich we are liable, of unwittingly iDaerting events between others\nwhich occurred in immediate sequence. This of course also depends\nupon the weakne88 of memory ; the events as. they originally occurred\nmay have acquired only a loose coherence in consciousness, so that\nan event afterwards imagined usurps easily a place in the series and\nbecomes fixed by recording and repetition. Aperfeetly pure interpo-\nlation,-that is, one which does not involve either BUbstitution or\ntranspontion,-probably does tlOt occur very often, and it would not be\neasy to establish the fact of its occurrence in any particular case;\nmixed interpolations are not uncommon.2\n. Now it is quite impoSsible to estimate rightly the reports of\n\" psychography\" and analogous performanCes without having some\nexperimental knowledge as to now far such reports lIiay be rendered\nuntrustworthy by these faults of partial and of cOlliplete omi88ion, of\nsubstitution, of transposition, and of interpolation.;:\nSuppose that we are considering the testi~OllY of a witness to his\n1 Tramp08ition.

This is no~ the place to discuss theDl in greater\ndetail.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fIntroduction. 389\nown separate and complete examination of a slate immediately previous,\nto the apparent production of writing. Then, according to what I\nhave been saying, we have-with a perfectly bond fide witness-four\npossibilities to consider besides the one that his impression is correct.\nIt may actually be that no examination at all was made by the witness\n(interpolation); it may be that, although made. the examination was\nnot made in the perfect manner now described (substitution) ; it may be\nthat the examination, although faultless and made at the sitting, was\nnot made on the occasion alleged (transposition); or it may be that\nalthough the examination was made as described,and on the occasion\nalleged, events, perhaps unnoticed or regarded by the witness as insignifi-\ncant, intervened between the examination and the apparent production\nof the writing (omission).\nI need hardly say that in relation to these inherent faults\nof memory leading to misdescription, we must consider the\nnatural tendency to exaggerate in recording phenomena sug\ngestive of occult agency; hence, in many cases, further omissionR\nand interpolations. But we must carefully distinguish this tendency\nto exaggerate from another cause of transfiguration which affects both\nperception and memory. I refer to the mental attitude of the sitter\nduring the seance.l Events that under ordinary circumstances, or if\nthe witnesses were intent upon discovering a trick, would make a com-\nparatively deep and lasting impression upon cOnsciousness, glide past\nor are swiftly forgotten, simply because of the absorption of the\nspectator's interest in the supposed \"supernormal\" manifestations.\nThe distortion traceable in many reports is largely due to special lapses -\nof memory for the explanation of which we must look chiefly to this\npeculiar emotional state. I shall refer to this consideration in\npointing out some of the difficulties in the way of Mr. Davey's investiga.-\ntions (see p. 396); and its importance, even as regards mal-observation,\nhas, I am sure,' been widely under-estimated. We cannot doubt\nthat many a Spiritualist has found htk convictions confirmed at\nsome seance by'displays of the most paltry imposture, who would,\nhSd he attended the. seance under the assurance that he was\nabout t<;l witness a conjuring performance, have detected the modus\nopera1u1i instantly. I may give an instance which came under my own\nobservation. At a materialisation seance given by Firman, at which I\nwas present, a supposed \"spirit-form\" appeared, draped.in a semi-\ntransparent flowing robe,-so transparent, in fact, that Firman's bare\narm was visible behind it, waving it to and fro. When the figure\nretired to the\" cabinet,\" the door closed upon a portion of the robe.\nThe door opened again slightly, and the end of the robe was drawn into\nI An illustration of these remarks will be feund in tile accounts of. the\ndifferent witnesses of SrrrING II. See p. 426. \/'\nDigi\n\f390 The P088ibilitie8 of Mal-Observation, J:c.\nthe\" cabinet.\" Most of the sitters perceived this clearly, but one, &\n\"believer,\" averred conscientiously that the fabric was not withdrawn.\"\nand that he saw it slowly melt away.\nI think it will hardly be denied that there are extreme cases where\nunquestioning faith incapacitates an otherwise intelligent witness; &nd\nalthough I do not challenge Mr. Massey's opinion that for mediumistic\nphenomena a certain psychical co-operation with the medium on the\npart of the investigator may be necesa.a.ry, I entertain no doubt that\nthe witness who gives this co-operation is le88 likely to discover\ntrickery than the man who is bent on discerning the modUlI operandi\nof what he knows to be conjuring. Nay, I shall go further and say that\nthere is an important difference between the investigator, however\n\" sceptical,\" who thinks itpOllBible that supernormal manifestations will\noccur, and the investigator who has some solid ground of &88urance,\nindependent of his own \"scepticism,\" that the manifestations will be\nconjuring tricks. The failure to understand this has caused BOme\nSpiritualists to put forward the claim that Mr. Davey should produce\nin their presence a phenomenon similar to, and under the same condi-\ntions as, some phenomenon which they describe themselves as having\nwitnessed with a profe88ional medium, or that he should at all events\nproduce the appearOlRCe of those conditions, &C. In the first place,\nthose who have put forward this claim do not seem to have taken the\nobvious course of demanding first that the medium should reproduce\nthe phenomenon as they desire Mr. Davey to reproduce it; and in the\nsecond place they ignore the fa.ctthat their own \"psychical condition,\"\nso different in the two cases-in one, a favouring co-operation, in the\nother, a resolve to expose-might be a bar to Mr. Davey, but an open\ndoor to the medium. Mr. Massey thinks that the sort of c(H)peration\nrequired is \"a mental disposition perfectly consistent with the most\nscientific vigilance.\" (Proceeding\" Part X., p. 98.) But his belief in\nthe poBBibility of this is not supported by what we know of mental\naction, since if any attention is being given to a favouring C(H)peration,\nprobably less will be available in consequence for so diBBimilar a task\nas the exercise of \"scientific vigilance\" j it is certainly not in\naccordance with my own experience as a psychically c(H)perating I\nsitter with mediums, and is directly opposed to the conclusions which\nI have formed as an observer of Mr. Davey's wttnesses.\nIn estimating, therefore, the value of the testimony to \"psycho-\ngraphy,\" we must ask-How much misdescription are we likely to find\nin the record that may be due to the ignorance of the witness concern-\ning the points worth mentioning' How much misdescription are we\nlikely to find owing to the impulse of the witness to exaggerate, possibly\nstimulated by the impetus of a new enthusiasm or the momentum of a\ncherished belief , We then come to the events as recollected at tits tir1l8\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fIntroduction. 391\nof eM record. How much distortion from the ewnL9 as originally\nperceived must we expect to fin~ in this recollection, owing to the\ninherent weakness of memory, increased as that may be by the peculiar\nmental attitude or emotional state of the witness t How far, in the\nnext place, may a description of the events as perceived by the\nwitness, have differed from a full and accurate description of the\neyents as they actually occurred, owing to the special ma.l-observa-\ntion displayed by the witness in consequence of a peculiar\nmental attitude or emotional state t Finally, how much must we\nallow for the mal-observation that may be caused by the exceptionally\ndisturbing in.6.uence of \"a person skilled in particular forms\nof deception, whose chief object is to prevent the witnesses from\nperceiving many of the actual occurrences, and to persuade them, by\ningenious illusions, to an erroneous belief concerning others\" 1(J01JIf\"n(J,\/,\nof the S.P.R. for January, 1887.)\nI endeavoured to show in the J01JIf\"n(J,\/, (October, November,\nSupplement to December, 1886)-making certain assumptions as to the\ndefects of perception and memory under the special circumstances\ninvolved-that the reports, printed in the Jowmal for June, 1886,\nof Eglinton's performances, were worthleBB for proving occult agenCy.\nThe aBBumptions which I made are completely justified by the mistakes\nwhich have been exhibited by those witnesses of Mr. Davey'S perform-\nances who are known to myself-persons whose general intelligence,\nknowledge of conjuring, powers of observation and retentiveness, &c.-\nso far as I can judge of these-entitle them to be placed on the\nsame level as the writers of the reports printed in the Jowrnal for\nJune, the majority of whom I also know personally. And I have\nnot yet seen any report of \"psychography\" which, when due allowance\nis made for the untrustworthiness of observation and recollection,\nexcludes the poBBibilities of conjuring.\nBy way of illustratmn I shall here deal briefly with a case\nconcerning which Mr. O. C. Massey specially challenges judgment. It\nis true that he does this chiefly upon the question of mal-observation,\nbut the case will serve as well to illustrate the poBBibilities of\nmemory illusion and trick mechanism. Mr. Massey quotes from\nthe case in P'I'OCeedingB, Part x., pp. 87, 88, and refers to his report\nin Light of April 19th, 1884, from which I take the following\nextract :-\nThere waa a pile of Mr. Eglinton's own slates upon the table, md it waa\nalwaya upon one or other of these that the writing was obtained. Of the\ntwo that were used, I cleaned one, after it had been well wetted, with a dry\nsponge, myaelf, on both sides; the other I saw similarly treated by Mr.\nEglinton.

How much (a) mal-observation, or (6) lapse of\nmemory, or (c) ignorance of conjuring contrivances on the part of Mr.\nMassey does this supposition appear to involve'\n(a) It must be observed, to begin with, that the phenomenon was\nnot a simple and isolated one; nor was it, 80 far as appears from the\naccount, suggested by Mr. Massey, or previously prepared for by him ;\nthe slateB were Eglinton's, and there was a pile of Eglinton's slates\non the table; Mr. Massey's attention, moreover, seems to have been\npartly given to the temperature of Eglinton's hand.\nWhat Mr. M&BBey really meant when he wrote in Light, \"Both\nslates were then, as I carefully &BBured myself, perfectly clean OD\nboth surfaces,\"_ is by no means clear. Wkm did Mr. M&BBeY\n1 The above sentence (together with Mr. Noel's eDdolllelllent) hardly seems\nexactly equivalent to \"our statement that Mr. EglintoD, .alter eD110Bing the\nDigitized by ~008 e\n\fIntroductio'n. 393\nassure himself' bVlYr6 or aft6'l' Eglinton laid one slate upon the other'\nIf after, are we to presume that he took the slates into his own hands\nand examined all four surfaces' Who, in this case, placed the slates\ntogether again' Mr. Massey, or Eglinton '1--\" we must have particu-\nlarity of statement, evidence that the witness has himself analysed the\nobservation into the acts of perception constituting i,t, and that at the\ntime of observation.\" (P'I\"oceedings, Part X., p. 89.) We should, I\nthink, do least violence to Mr. Massey's report if we suppose him to\nhave meant to say that he had carefully assured himself just be\/lYr6\nEglinton laid one slate upon the other; and in this case I hold that\nMr. Massey's observation could have been deceived, that there might\nhave been one side of one slate, which he never saw, or that another\ns1&te might have been substituted for one of two slates, both sides of\nwhich he did see. Mr. Massey does not state that he took the two\nslates in question into his own hands, and I have no ground for suppos\u00b7\ning that at that time he was an expert in detecting sleight-of-hand\nmanipulations of slates.~ So much for the amount of mal-observation\nrequired.\n(h) Proceeding now to lapse of memory, let us suppose that\nthe slates were clean when Eglinton laid them together as de-\nscribed. Mr. Massey says that Eglinton \"then forthwith, and\nwithout any previous dealing with them, presented,\" &c. The\nsitting was in the afternoon, and Mr. Massey wrote his account of\nit in the evening of the same day. We have to consider there-\nfore whether it is possible that Mr. Massey-with the grant of an\nexceptionally good memory - should have 'l\"ememh6'l'M Eglinton's\npresentation of the slates to him as having immediately followed upon\nEglinton's original placing of them together, although these events\nmight in reality have been separated by an interval during which\nEglinton might have changed one of the slates for a third. For ex-\nample, suppose that when Eglinton lifted the slates the pencil dropped\nout, and Eglinton removed one slate, placed a scrap of pencil on the\nsecond slate, and then replaced, not the first, but a third slate lying\nclose by on the table. Might seme apparently trivial (to the conception\nof Mr. Massey) incident of this kind have been completely forgotten\nby Mr. Massey when he was writing his account, so that the preceding\npencil within the slates which we then 'carefully &8IIured' ourSelves were botA\nquite clean on botA sunac88,\" &C. (Prouecling8, loco cit.). There is nothingsaid\nin the original report about Mr. Noel'8 \"carefully &8IIuring\" himself, and the\nmeaning of t\/&en, is here less apparently ambiguous than in the original report.\n1 To avoid complication I am dealing with points of observation and memory\nas separately as possible. But in connection with Mr. M&BBey's statement\nwhich I have considered above, I might have qU88tioned whether he had not\nmisplaced hisJeeling of &8IIurance or the prDCUI by which he &88UrM himself.\nDigitized by ~oo8le\n\f3940 The PoBBibilities of Mal-Observation, tl:c.\nand succeeding events becamejoined in his remembrance t 80 far am\nI from thinking this impossible, that I regard it, owing to my\nexperiences with other witneaaea, sa not even improbable. Indeed I\nthink it even possible that Mr. Massey's holding of the slates might\nhave been intMTupted by some analogously\" trivial\" incident. Stat&-\nments moat expre88 and definite, made by an honest witne88, may, sa I\nhave already pointed out, be erroneous from other causes than simple\nmal-obaervation or the unwit:f.ing interpolation of\" specific and positive\nacts of perception,\" though they may be erroneous from these causes\nalso. They are often due to other and more frequent forms of the\nuniversal weakness of human memory, and may be the resnlt of\ntransposition in the order of events, or of a mere and sheer lapse.\nConcerning the poBBibilities, then, either of mal-observation or of\nlapse of memory, I traverse Mr. M8088ey's assertion that\" the witness\ncould not innocently use terms BXprtJ\"ly and ckfiniuly inconsistent\nwith what really happened,\" which I must characterise &8 an aBBump-\ntion completely destroyed by the reports of Mr. Davey's performances.\n(c) But let us now admit, for the present purpose, that Mr. Massey's\naccount of the incident i!I correct. He adds, in his report in lAg\"\"\n(p-. IW), tha,t\u00b7\" &8 writing by the medium himself at the time is\nabsolutely out of the question, there are onlythree other conceivable\nsuggestions &8 opposed to occult agency.\" I do not of course question\nthe veracity of the witnesses; and the other two suggestions, which\nMr. Massey offers reasons for rejecting, are\" a change of slate,\" and\n\"concealed writing brought out by heat.'; Another suggestion has\nsince, apparently, occurred to him.\n\" .Aa it is imaginable that a thin sheet of lllate, already inscribed on one\nlIide, might be loollely fitted into the frame of one of the alatell U8ed,\nclean lIurface uppennost, so &II to fall into the frame of the\nother alate, written lIide uppennOllt, when the fint was placed upon\nthe second, it is fortunate that I W&ll able to exclude that lIuggestion\nby my po8IIell8ion of the slate on which the writing appeared,\nwhich, by.the\u00b7bye, W&II wrapped in paper, either by myself or by\nMr. Eglinton-under my eY8ll, at my requellt, and carried away by\nme, immedutlely after we had examined the writing, the Bitting\nbeing then clOlled.\" (Proceedlfl9'j ~\".x, Pl'. 88-9.)\nThere is clear indication that Mr. Massey had not contemplated this\npoBBibility at the time-two years earlier~f the sitting, and it might\nbe contended that the slate which Mr. Massey took away W&8 not that\none of the two slates upon which the writing was first found, but\nanother similarly inscribed slate, which Eglinton had provided for the\npurpose; it probably often happens that sitters request permission to\ntake away the slates upon which writing has appeared. \"Mr. Massey\nwould apparently guard against this hypothesis of a~8eq~nt change\nized byL.oogle\n\fInt'l'Oduction. 395\nof alate by the laat sentence of the passage quoted above, but no\nimportance can be attributed to this,-if only on the ground that Mr.\nM.assey was unaware, at the time of the sitting, of the possibility to\nwhich he has more recently drawn attention. If the sentence in\nquestion expresses-not some record made by Mr. Massey on the day of\nthe sitting, but-Mr. Massey's r6m6mbmnce a.fter two Y6Ol1\"', and if he\naeriously means it to exclude the hypothesis before us, there would be a\nvaster divergence than I have hitherto supposed between Mr. Massey\nand myself as to the ordinary psychology of memory ; and I should,\nespecially when Ifrecallthe rigorous signification with which Mr. Massey\nprofessedly uses the word immediately, class the sentence as an instance\nof b0n4 fide transfiguration of the same character as some which I\nsupposed in Mr. Davey's reports of Eglinton. (Journa.l of the S.P.R.\nfor November, 1886.)\nBut I may point out that there is another suggestion still, which\ndoes not appear to me to be inconsistent with anything that M.r. Massey\nhas said. The slate upon which the writing was found may have been\nan ordinary slate, and may have been taken away by Mr. Massey, and\neM other .late, though apparently ordinary, ~ay have been a.trick slate,\nwith room for a false flap that could be fixed, if necessary, by a spring,\nand that was also adapted to fit the ordinary slate, and which had been\nplaced so as to cover the prepared writing. The details of the trick will\nbe obvious.\nMr. Massey's case is thus, in my opinion, vitiated on three\nseparate grounds, by the considerations due to the possibilities of mal-\nobservation, lapse of memory, and trick mechanism. I cannot, therefore,\nattach much value to his opinion, which, when his record appeared in\nLight, was :-\n\" I am as satisfied that this was a genuine phenomenon as I am that the\nwords on this paper are of my own writing.\"\nBut while in this instance Mr. Massey's confidence in 1884 proves\nto have been misplaced, in consequence of his ignorance of a possible\npiece of trick apparatus, I do not think that his high estimate of the\nevidence for\" psychography\" generallyis invalidated chiefly either by\nignorance of this kind, or by his large trust in human observation. It\nis invalidated chiefly, I venture to think, by his apriori presumption\nthat honest witnesses cannot use terms \"expTIlB.ly and definitely\ninconsistent with what really happened\" ; and he could not have made\nthis presumption had he given due weight to the possibilities of memory\nillusion. I have already sho.Jn what small lapses of memory may have\nmade his own specific and positive assertions erroneous; and it is\nobvious how, by simple omissions and transpositions, without any pure\ninterpolations at all, the record of an honest witness may be~ndered\nDigitized by ~008le\n\f396 The P088ibilities of Mol-Observation, etc.\nfull of the most fundamental misstatements. Much of Mr.lfassey's\npaper, as he himself says, was cc an attempt to show\" that .. the\nsupposition of such descriptions as \u2022 he ' and others have given of\nEglinton's slate-writing being given of the performances of an avowed\nconjurer . . . is an impossible one.\" (ProcudingB, Part X, p. 108.)\nThe reader may decide for himself whether this II impossibility\" has\nbeen realised or not. For my own part, I maintain that the reports\nwhich follow are a practical and complete rejoinder to the considera-\ntions alleged by Mr. Massey in his reply to the position advanced by\nMrs. Sidgwick.\nI may here again draw attention to some of the difficulties (W'hieh\nI pointed out in the JOtIIf\"flOl, of the S.P.R. for October, l~) in the\nway of obtaining adequate reports of cc slate-writing\" performances\nwhich are known independently to be the result of conjuring, and to\nthe manner in which these difficulties have been partially, though not\ncompletely, overcome by Mr. Davey. In the first place, proficiency in\nthe production of apparently cc occult\" slate-writing requires not only\npractice in the manipulation of slates, &c., but a lengthened experience\nof sitters, '!ihich cannot be acquired in a short time by a person who\nis chiefly occupied with other business. It is har;dly to be expected\nthat accounts of a novice's phenomena should compare for marvellous-\nness with the results of .. old mediumistic hands\" like Eglinton and\nSlade. Still, Mr. Davey was able to devote much of his time during the\nlatter part of last year to the improvement of his methods, and has\nthus been able to produce results which in quality, if not in quantity,\nmay fitly be compared, for the purposes of our inquiry, with the\nproductions of the best professional mediums.\nIn the second place, I must repeat that it is impossible to induce\nthe same peculiarity of mental attitude in the sitters with a professed\nconjurer, as they would have assumed had they been sitting with a\nprofessional medium. I think I may safely say that not a single person\nof all those whose reports were published in the Jowrnal for June\nfelt certain beforehand that Eglinton's performances were explicable\nby conjuring; indeed, I may go further and say that nearly all, if not\nall, thought it not improbable that the phenomena were genuine,\nand that most of them bad been strongly impressed by reports which\nthey had previously heard or read. Now,the evidence of a person\nholding this attitude is likely to be of decidedly less value cfllUril pariInu\nthan that of a person who fully believes that he is\u00b7watching a conjuring\ntrick. I do not mean merely that there is a reluctance on his part to\nsay or do anything which may imply a direct suspicion of the honesty\nof the II medium,\" or that, so far as his attention is directed at all,\nit is too exclusively occupied with the observation of the conditions\nat the time when the II occult\" agency is BUfJPOBed to be actually\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fIntroduction. 397\nproducing the writing; though from these causes also, in many cases,\nhis testimony is likely to be less reliable. What I mea.n is that the idea\nof communication from the\" spirit-world,\" or of some supernormal power\nin the\" medium,\" will, in most persons, possess activity enough, even\nbefore any results are obtained, to interfere more or less with the obser-\nvation of the conditions involved ; and after the results are obtained, the\ndominance of the idea will frequently be great enough to contribute\nvery materially to the naturally speedy oblivescence of many details of\nthe sitting which were hardly noticed at the time of their occurrence,\nwhich in the course perhaps of an hour or two have dimmed out\nof recollection, but which, nevertheless, would have suggested the\nsecret of the trick. Under this head I may also refer to the fact' that\nthe conversation held by the\u00b7 sitters with a professed conjurer will\nprobably be of less avail in distracting their attention than if they\nwere sitting with a \"med!\"um\" with any the smallest expectation that\n\" occult\" phenomena. might occur. In the former case they are well\naware that the conversation is for the express purpose of distracting\ntheir attention from the movements of the conjurer ; in the latter case,\nthey endeavour to a certain extent to occupy the mind-according to\ninstructions-with matters foreign to the sequence of events then and\nthere transpiring.\nIn the third place, comparatively few persons are willing to write\nout reports of slate-writing experiences with a full account of\nthe supposed test conditions, if they have any suspicion that\nthe writing has been produced by mere conjuring. They are\nafraid of appearing ridiculous, and in this dread, if they are per-\nsuaded to write reports at all, they wnte them with a meagre\nallowance of detail, and with an abstention from dogmatic statement.\nNo doubt the fear of ridicule has deterred many persons from writing\nreports on behalf of the professed\" medium,\" but we must not disguise\nfrom ourselves the fact that when this fear has been overcome by the\nenthusiasm which often accompanies the formation of a new belief, the\nreports then are less to be trusted, by reason of that very enthusiasm.\nAnalogous to that undeliberate warping of evidence which arises from\nthe desire to justify the adoption of a new faith and to aid in\nproselytising others, is that which arises from the desire to strengthen\nthe grounds of a conviction which has already been fully formed ;\nthe spiritualistic bias has been much more operative in transfiguring the\naccounts of mediumistic phenomena than most Spiritualists would be\nwilling to admit. Possibly a wider experience may result in our finding\na counterpart to this in the testimonials to professed conjuring perfor-\nmances, but my experience hitherto leads me to think that such a result\nis highly improbable.\nThese difficulties have been partly obviated by the fact tQA..t manl of\nDigitized by ~0081e\n\f398 The POBBibilities of Mal-Observation, Icc.\nMr. Davey's sitters were not informed until after they had written their\nreports that his phenomena were due to conjuring. It has, neverthe-\nless, weakened some of the accounts, that Mr. Davey felt himself\nrestrained from asserting that the phenomena were produced by\n\" spirits\"; he frequently asserted that they were not produced by spirits,\nbut that he preferred to adopt the ordinary procedure of the spiritual-\nistic medium; and, refusing to offer any explanation, thus shrouding\ntheir origin in convenient mystery, he usually requested his witnesses\nto determine the causes of the phenomena for themselves, the possibility\nof triQkery included. Sometimes, indeed, he assured his sitters that he\nwould take advantage of any carelessness which they displayed; and on\none occasion he informed a sitter to whom the locked slate was after-\nwards entrusted and who placed it in the tail of his coat, that if he\nobtained an opportunity he would even take the slate from the pocket\nof this very sitter, and write upon it surreptitiously. Later in the\nsitting this witness, who I mlU\" say had been previously impressed by\nsome writing obtained at a sitting with Eglinton, was called upon to\nproduce the locked slate, and place it upon the table; yet so much\nhad he been carried away by the appearance of the writing just\nproduced by Mr. Davey on a single slate, that he had, for the time,\ncompletely forgotten the existence of the locked slate, and did not\nremember what he had done with it until the other sitters reminded\nhim that he had placed it in his own pocket. This is a very extreme\ncase of the influence of a mental attitude which has undoubtedly in\nsome degree been very prevalent among sitters for mediumistio\nphenomena.\nNot that it is by any means universal; and this leads me to say\nthat one great advantage which some mediums, especially Eglinton,\nhave used very freely, has been foregone by Mr. Davey. He has not\nbeen withheld from producing phenomena by the apparent observancy\nof the sitters. My own choice of sitters for Mr. Davey was deter-\nmined chieJiy 1 by the desire to obtain educated and intelligent\nwitnesses who did not know certainly that Mr. Davey's performances\nwere conjuring, and who could be relied upon to write out a detailed\naccount soon after the sitting. Mr. Davey's unfortunate ill-health,\nsoon after I first met him in September of last year, alone prevented\nhim from obtaining a much larger number of reports. The witnesses\nwere invariably urged to write their accounts as soon as possible after\n1 I had another reason as well for requesting Mr. Davey to give a sitting\nto Mr. Padahah. I knew that Mr. Padahah had had lOme unconvincing sittiDga\nwith Eglinton. Mr. and Mrs. RUBBell were unexpected witnessea; Mr. Legge\nwas also an unexpected witness. A ~ance was given to Mr. Dodds because he\nhad scoffed mercilessly at Mr.Legge's account of his experience.-See SrrrIN08\n11, III, IV, VIII.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f1ntrodu..ction. 399\nthe sitting, while the occurrences were still fresh in their memory. It\nwill be difficult for persons who have not had experience in making\nrecords of this kind to realise how quickly even incidents which have\nbeen recognised as important fade out of memory. And nothing\nbetrays more fully the misappreciation of the value of the testimony\nwe are considering than the reliance which has been so commonly\nplaced upon detailed reports written weeks, months, and even years\nafter the seance. I may refer here to the worthlessness of second-\nhand accounts and of abridged accounts. A careful original account,\nhowever faulty-if written shortly after the sitting, will often be found\nto contain some clues to the trick operations of the medium, which may\nbe entirely absent from the later a.ccount. An instance of this was\nfurnished by one of the reports printed in the Journal of the S.P.R.\nfor June, 1886. The report was one sent to our Society by three of\nour Corresponding Members in St. Petersburg. It appears to have been\ncondensed in a German magazine, N~ Spiritualistische BliUter, the\nCI principal occurrences\" only being mentioned; and a. translation of\nthis condensed account is given in Light, September 25, 1886. From\nthis later version of the seance a series of incidents which indicate, as I\nthink, how the chief trick was performed, are entirely omitted; and\nwriting, which according to the original report is described as having\nbeen obtained on an ordinary slate, is described in the later version as\nhaving been obtained between sealed double slates.}\nCeteris paribus, the testimony of two witnesses to the same occur-\nrence is rightly regarded as better than the testimony of one. We\nmust, nevertheless, be cautious in the application of this principle to\nthe testimony for \"psychographic\" phenomena. A reference to the\nreports which follow will show that wherever separate accounts are\ngiven of the same sitting, the witnesses are never in complete agree-\nment, and they sometimes differ on important points. Thi8 we found\nalso to be the case where independent accounts were given of the same\nsitting with Eglinton (Journal for October and November, 1886). In\nthe large number of cases, therefore, where the detailed record of a.\nsitting has been made by one only of two or more witnesses, and the\nrecord thus made has been every word of it endorsed by the other\nwitness or witnesses, we have another proof of that plasticity of\nmemory to which I have drawn attention. It must be concluded that\nin the majority, if not all, of these cases, some of the remembrances,\nwhether true or false, of the later co-signatories have become trans-\nformed to fit the remembrances of the recorder, and this, perhaps, in\nmost instances, by the mere reading of the record. It is of course\nnot easy to obtain accounts which shall be absolutely independent, since\n1 See Supplement to the Journal for December, 1886, p. 516.\nizedbyGoogle\n\f400 TM P088ibilitia of Mal-Ob8ervatinn, Icc.\nthis requires that no communication of any kind connected with the\nphenomena should pass between the witnesses after the commencement\nof the sdance until the reports have been written, and probably only\nan approximation to this absolute independence has been attained\nwhere separate accounts have been given of the same sitting with Mr.\nDa.vey.\nIt may occur to some ingenious readers of the reports which follow\nand the notes given in the Appendix, that owing to illusions of percep-\ntion and memory, Mr. Davey and myself 1 have given misdescriptions\nof what really happened at the sdanees, that the other witnesses are\nright and we are wrong. It is unnecessary to explain the \"psychical\"\nconditions under which Mr. Davey and myself were sitting, so different\nfrom those of the other sitters; I may refer such readers to the opinion\nof persons versed in conjuring tricks, and familiar with the misdescrip-\ntions given of them by the uninitiated\u00b7-a.nd especially to the opinion of\nMr. Angelo J. Lewis (p. 485). I repeat that the \"psychographic\"\nphenomena. described in the following records are conjuring, and only\nconjuring, performances, and I may add that I was very careful myself,\nin the sdanoes where I was present, to take the part of an ordinary\nsitter, and to avoid doing anything which would a.ssist Mr. Davey in\nthe smallest degree. Indeed, Mr. Davey would have preferred my\nabsence, as part of the task which I had set myself was to watch Mr.\nDavey's movements at the critical moments, in order that I might give\nmy independent testimony concerning the mod~ of production of the\nphenomena.\nThese phenomena, as described, may well seem marvellous enough\nto demand the hypothesis of occult agency: writing between a\nconjurer's own slates in a way quite inexplicable to the oonjurer,-\nwriting upon slates locked and carefully guarded by the witnesses,-\nwriting upon single slates held by the witnesses firmly against the under\nsurface of the table,-writing upon slates held by the witnesses above\nthe table,-&Dswers to questions written secretly in locked slates,-\ncorrect quotations appearing on guarded slates from books chosen by\nthe witnesses at random, and sometimes mentally, the books not\ntouched by the \"medium,\"-writing in different colours, mentally\nchosen by the witnessell, covering the whole side of one of their own\nslates,-messages in languages unknown to the\" medium,\" including a\nmenage in German for which only a mental request had been made,\nand 8. letter in Japanese in 8. double-slate locked and sealed by the\nwitne88,-the date of a coin placed by the witneSB in a sealed envelope\ncorrectly written in a locked slate upon the table, the envelope re-\n1 Mr. Davey agreed with my notes except where I have stated to the\ncontrary.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fI nt'l'Od'UCtion. 401\nmaining intact,-a word written between slates screwed together and\nalso corded and sealed together, the word being chosen by the witness\nafter the slates were fastened by himself, &c., &C. And yet, though\n\" autographic\" fragments of pencil were\" heard\" weaving mysterious\nmessages between and under and over slates, and fragments of chalk\nwere seen moving about under a tumbler placed above the tablEl in full\nview,-none of the sitters witnessed that best phenomenon, Mr. DUIVtJ'!\/\nwriting.\nA few words remain to be said as to the principle which has been\nfollowed in adding or withholding notes explanatory of the modi\noperandi adopted by Mr. Davey.\nThe object of the notes given in the Appendix is not to explain\nthe tricks, though explanations of some of the incidents are given or\nsuggested. To explain the tricks would in itself be of little advantage\nto the investigator of the \"physical phenomena\" of mediums, since\nmany methods of producing \"psychography\" may exist besides those\nwhich Mr. Davey has employed; and were all of those in present use\nto be made public property, others would doubtless be invented, and\naccidental opportunities for producing successful illusions would still\narise. I may point out moreover,-and this is a consideration\nfrequently overlooked-that it is a great mistake to suppose that\nspecific verbal explanations, in as far as these are possible, of all the\nmethods practised by \"mediums,\" would effectua.l1y check deception\neven by those very methods; there are tricks that can be explained to\na witness, and then performed in his presence without his detecting\nthem, and while he imagines himself to be fully on his guard against\nthem.1 It would be a still greater mistake to suppose that explana.-\ntions of the methods in use would convince those who have testified\nfrom personal experience to the genuineness of the \"psychography\" of\nEglinton, Slade, &c., that such methods were used for the production of\nthe phenomena which they witnessed. They will scarcely be likely to\nremernher the occurrence of events which they perhaps never observed\nat all, or observed only partially and erroneously; which, whether\ncorrectly or incorrectly observed, they have afterwards continually\nmisdescribed or completely forgotten; and which, in many cases, would\nbe distinctly excluded by the acceptance of their testimony as it\nstands. Further, it must be said,-and this will become obvious to the\ncareful student of the reports-that no description of particular\nmovements or peculiar apparatus would suffice as an exhaustive\nexplanation of the performances recorded; the best part of the\ntrickery is in truth indescribable, it is as fluent and uncertain as the\n1 I have actu&lly seen this don..\nDigitized by (i(j)()gle\n\f402 The P088ibilities of Mal-Observation, I:c.\nshifting attention of the witnesses, and varies with the variations of\ntheir temporarily dominant expectations and emotions.\nThe object of the notes, then, is to show to investigators the kind\nand degree of mistakes which may be made by educated and intelli-\ngent witnesses in recording their impression of a performance the main\nlines of which are planned with the deliberate intention of deceiving\nthem, but few, if any, of the details of which can be described as\nabsolutely fixed.\nThe notes, as given, might suggest to the ordinary reader some\nunfounded conclusions. They seem in some cases to indicate so much\ncarelessneaa on the part of the sitters, to open out such easy\npoaaibilities of trick for the conjurer, that the reader may fancy that\nthe witnesses were unusually gullible, and that Mr. Davey had in\nreality little to do. To this the supporters of Eglinton may probably\nadd that an \" experienced Spiritualist\" would have run no risk of being\nsimilarly deceived. These conclusions, I have no doubt, would be\nmistaken. In the first place, the witnesses would certainly not have\nbeen objected to before actual trial as of less than average competence;\nnor do I think that &8 a matter of fact they have shown leas than\naverage acumen or care. They may be taken, too, as a fairly repre-\nsentative group, including, as they do, succeaaful men of business, men\nof ordinary university training, electrical engineers, members of the\nlegal and educational professions, &c.; they include one profeasional\nconjurer, and others-aa Mr. Padshah and Mias Symons-who had\ngiven some previous attention, as their accounts may sufficiently show,\nto the risks of mal-obaervation on such occasions as these. Of the great\ntreachery of memory, indeed, the majority of Mr. Davey's sitters have\nbeen unaware, but of this the witneases of other \"slate-writing\" per-\nfonnances have, unquestionably, been at least equally unaware. In\nsupportof this it is enough again to remind the reader that in all the\ncases where separate accounts, more or less independent, of the same\nsitting were given by the witneaaes of Eglinton's _nees recorded in the\nJOUNw.l of the Society for Psychical Research for June, 1886, a\ncomparison I of the accounts elicits the fact that the witnesses exhibited\nforms of memory-illusion precisely parallel to some of those which\nhave been exhibited by the witnesses of Mr. Davey's performances.\nAnd be it observed that mistakes of the kind illustrated in the\nnotes are not, prior to special study, any proof of obtuseneas or\nparticular deficiency of memory. Mr. Davey himself, before he had\nstudied the \"slate-writing\" forms of conjuring, was a decided offender\nin this respect (see Journal of the S.P.R. for October and November,\n1 See the criticism of the evidence in the Jovmal for October and\nNov.mber,l886.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fIntroduction.\n1886); and I have pointed out my own shortcomings and those of my\ncolleagues with, I hope, an unsparing hand (see Supplement to the\nDecember number of the J~. I do not, in point of fact, think\nthat this unpreparedneBS and inobservancy of mind, in the presence\nof a conjurer, is a thing of which anyone who is not familiar with the\ntricks already need be ashamed. I have a strong suspicion-founded\nby this time on a pretty wide experience-that those of my readers\nwho may be most disposed to deride the simplicity of the witnesses\nnow to be cited,would themselves have come out of the ordeal no better\nthan Mr. &it, and not so well as Mr. PMlshah.\nBut, although mankind-as I believe-a.re thus inattentive and\ncareleBS and forgetful beyond their own common notion of themselves,\nit must not be supposed that it is an easy task to play upon their\ninattention and forgetfulness as Mr. Davey has done. On the contrary\n- without making any claim for him of inimitable skill-it must be\npointed out that his achievements, simple as they may seem, and by\nreason of their very simplicity, belong not to a low but to a high claBS\nof conjuring performance. For the psychologist, and quite apart from\nthe question of effect producible on large audiences, there may be said\nto be three claBSes of conjuring of progressively deeper interest. Least\ninteresting to the psychologist are the effects which depend on\nmachinery or apparatus, great as the mechanical skill involved may be.\nMore interesting are those which depend on pure prestidigitation, on an\nassured competence to perform some given action so swiftly and\ncunningly that the spectator will fail to see it. But higher still in\npsychological interest comes a claBS of conjuring performances which\nconsist not 80 much in eluding the.perceptions of the witneBSe8 by the\nspeed and dexterity of one's own movements, as in gently inducing\nthem, by means different in each case, to bewilder and entrap them-\nselves. The conjurer here wins as by the adroitness of a clever thief,\nwho poses for the nonce as a detective, persuasively points out the most\nsubtle and efficient precautions against robbery, and all the while is\nemptying your pockets. In this last claBS of performance, the better\nthe conjuring is, the less of it is needed; and its greatest triumph is\nwhen the spectator's mind has been brought into such a state that he-\nso to say--does his conjuring for himself, and stands astounded at his\nown interpretation of some entirely obvious phenomenon. Thus Mr.\nPadshah, in one of the most instructive of the incidents below to be\nrecorded, turned the conjurer's very scrawl into a crowning success,\nand read Book8 into BorYrZU.\nOnce more; if it be claimed in any quarter that \"experienced\nSpiritualists\" would have been able to detect Mr. Davey'S methods\nmore easily than the witnesses actually adduceQ, I trust that I may be\nallowed to say, without giving offence, that to my mind the prn~tiQD\nDigitized by 0 Ole\nD .. O\nJ\n\f4040 The P088ibilitiu of Mal-Ob8ervatinn, I:c.\nis strongly the other way. I have already explained that the power of\ndetecting conjuring tricks is not a test of general capacity, but rather\na result of having studied simila.r conjuring tricks beforehand. The\n\"experience\" involved in much ance-going is a.ssuredly not an\nexperience that makes in this direction; the mental attitude induced is\nthe very wo~t possible for the discovery of trickery, and it has been\non \"experienced Spiritualists\" that those mediuma have thriven whom\nmere ignorant outsiders have afterwards caught in palpable fraud. I\ndo not, of course, mean that no \"experienced Spiritualist\" has ever\ncaught a rogue out; but such exhibitions, for instance, a.s those of\nHaxby and Firman (se&- P, ocee~~), certa.inly\nshow that it is not to the circles of devout believers that we are to look\nfor detection of even the grossest and most tra.nsparent imposture.\nBut I am anxious not to be supposed to a.ssert that \"experienced\nSpiritualists\" are less acute than other men. I must yet again\nemphasise the fact that the difference depends on previous attitude of\nmind; and there is plenty of evidence to show how many minds at\nhow many seances, have been in much the sa.me condition a.s Mr.\nPa.dshah's when he recognised the convincing word BOO'f'ZU. I will\ncite one instance only, which exemplifies the influence of the\nSpiritualistic bia.s even beyond the sphere of professed mediums. It\nis a letter written by perhaps the most experienced of a.ll Spiritualists,\nendorsing an opinion held by a man than whom none more eminent,\nnone more widely or justly respected, has ever avowed adherence to a\nbelief in Spiritualism. \"M.A. (Oxon.)\" wrote as follows to The\nMedium and D41Jbrea\/r, of August 24th, 1877:-\nI am glad to lee that Hr.

J. DA.VEY.\nFor some time past 1 have practised \"slate-writing,\" and have given\nup much leisure time to the subject, with a view to discovering how far\nordinary witnesses can be deceived by conjuring performances. I have\nreceived reports of my experiments from various persons, and these I\nsubjoin, with comments, in some cases, as to lapses of observation or\nmemory on the part of the witnesses. Lest there should be any mis-\nunderstanding I must explain what induced me to take up the subject,\nand the general conclusions to which 1 have been led.\nReaders of the Jowrnal of the S.P.R. are aware that 1 sent reports\nof sittings with Eglinton to our Society in 1884, and that 1 had pre-\nviously sent reports of the same sittings to the periodical Light. I do\nnot now attribute any value to these reports as proving the reality\nof so-called \"psychography,\" for reasons which will appear in the\nsequel.\nMy chief interest in Spiritualism generally was awakened by an\nexperience of my own, which was as follows :-In 1883, owing to a\nserious lung complaint, I spent several months at a Continental health\nresort. During this visit, one of my companions died under circum-\nstances of an unusually distressing character; and another friend and\nmyself had been in frequent attendance upon him during his last ill-\nness. His body was subsequently dissected, in the presence of my\nother companion, Mr. O. Three weeks after this I was startled one\nnight by seeing what appeared to be the face and form of my deceased\nfriend under circumstances that greatly surprised me, and the next day,\nwhilst visiting Mr. C., who lodged in the same hotel as myself, he\ninformed me that he had that night experienced a remarkably vivid\ndream in which he had seen our deceased friend. 1 then for the first\ntime related to Mr. C. what had happened to myself.l\nOn my return to England I began to devote some attention to the\nstudy of alleged psychical phenomena, and I perused several works\nrelating to the subject, including Zollner's Tronscendemal Phtgllicl,\nPsychic FO'1'ce, by Professor Crookes, Miracles and Mod_ Spiritualism,\nby Alfred Russel Wallace, The Debatohle Land, by Robert Dale Owen,\nPsychography, The Report ofthe Dialectical Society, &c., and 1 formed\na circle of friends for the investigation of the alleged phenomena.\n1 I have since had BOrne correspondence with Mr. C., who does not look\nupon the incident as anything more than a dream coinc;idence. At the time, I\nattached particular significance to my own experience, as my friend, when alive,\nhad diacnsaed the question of Spiritualiam with me.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f406 The POBBibilitia of Mal-Ob8ervation, J:c.\nDuring my first experiments I found myself affected a good deal by\ninvoluntary movements which I could not then account for, though I\nnow have little doubt they were caused simply by nervous excite-\nment; however, nothing of any significance happened, and it was at\nthis stage of my investigation that I made the acquaintance of\nEglinton, of whose ao-called \"psychography\" I had heard. At the\nconclusion of my first seance with Eglinton, which took place in June,\n1884, I could not account for the phenomena except on the\nSpiritualistic hypothesis, and I was led to believe, from the \"communi-\ncations\" which I then received, that I possessed psychic powers. My\nsecond seance with Eglinton, on October 8th, 1884, waa a failure, bnt\nmy third, on October 9th, 1884, waa a SUCCeB8. I waa somewhat excited\nat these results, and even contemplated making a collection of cases\n\/ to convince the unbelieving world. On October 9th, 1884, the sup-\nposed invisibles informed me that I had \" developed my own powers\nto an appreciable extent, owing to their former advice.\" Now, between\nmy first and third seances I certainly had experienced privately one or\ntwo incidents which I then regarded aa genuine psychical pbenomena,\nand I will brieJiy relate one of these experiences.\nOne afternoon in September, 1884, I took two slates and determined\nto experiment alone. I held them together with a small pencil grain\nbetween. I was in my library; the slates were taken out of a\nprivate box by myself; I glanced at them and placed them in the\nposition above described. In the course of some few minutes I lifted\nup the slates and examined them, and found the word\" Beware\" written\nin large characters across the under side of the upper slate. My\nastonishment at this cannot well be described, as I felt convinced I had\npreviously thoroughly examined the slates, and I took the first train to\nLondon, and showed them to my friend Mr. X. (see Journal for\nOctober, pp. 435, 436). He agreed with me in saying it was almost\nincredible. I then attributed the above, and one or two kindred\nphenomena, to the action of an abnormal power proceeding from myself.\nIt was afterwards proved to me that these experiences were neither\nmore nor less than simple hoaxes, perpetrated by some of my friends.\nIn the case of the particular incident which I have described, the\nslate had been tampered with during my previous absence from home.\nI have no doubt that, not suspecting any interference with my slates,\nI bad not thoroughly examined them immediately before sitting, as I\nsupposed myself to have done. Another incident of a somewhat\nludicrous character may be mentioned here. I had bought a trick\nslate, which had been sold to me as an explanation of the process\nused by mediums. I thought, however, that this waa scarcely true,\nas the trick soomed to be a very palpable one. I had put this\nslate away in my drawer with the other slates containing the\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fEXperVmental Investigation. 407\nwriting of Eglinton's supposed spirits. One morning, on going to this\ndrawer, which I usually kept locked, I found the following words, or\nsomething to the same effect, written across the false surface of the\ntrick slate: \"We object to your learning trickery.\" I then compared\nthis writing with some on Eglinton's slates, and found it apparently\nidentical. I was naturally somewhat amazed, and I did not then for a\nmoment suspect that my friends were hoaxing me, and that the above\nsentence had been written in careful imitation of the writing on\nEglinton's slates. Also, during seances held privately, I con-\ntinued to be frequently seized by spasmodic movements when I\nbelieved \"uncanny\" manifestations were about to take place.\n.As a conjurer, I have been since amused sometimes at similar\nconvulsions in others during my conjuring performances, when\nthe sitters have supposed that the writing was being produced by\nsupernatural means; my own s~udderings during these performances\n\/ '\nbeing, of course, part of the trick.\nI had several other seances with Eglinton after October 9th, 1884,\nall of which proved blanks, except one held on January 15th, 1885. One\nof my friends who accompanied me to this sitting assured me he had\nactually seen Eglinton imitating the sound of writing at the time when\nI thought a long communication was being written. I endeavoured to\nbe more watchful at the two sittings which I had after this, the final\nseance being on June 25th, 1885; but at neither of these did any\nresults occur, although I did not inform Eglinton of the informati4iln I\nhad received. However, partly in consequence of my friend's convic-\ntion that Eglinton's performances were only tricks, I began, after\ngetting no further results, to apply myself anew to see what could be\nproduced by conjuring. I then met with an individual who professed\nto sell me\" secrets,\" which he gave me to understand he had procured\nfrom an American medium. I also bought one by which words, \u00abc.,\ncould be made to appear on the flesh after it was rubbed over with\nburnt paper. This trick has evidently been exhibited by Eglinton as\na \"mediumistic phenomenon\" (See 'Twixt Two Worlds, pp. 52, 54).\nI soon made use of the knowledge thus acquired by performing\nbefore friends and acquaintances, and I found that even at that\nearly stage of my practice many of them could be deceived as to\nmy real modus operandi. Eglinton has attempted to give particular\nvalidity to the accounts of my successful seances with him in 1884,\nclaiming my testimony as that of one who had\" specially studied and\npractised the art of simulating the slate-writing phenomena under\nconjurers' conditions\" (Light, July 31st, 1886). I have already pointed\nout elsewhere that I was not an expert in 1884, when I wrote the\nreports in question, which Eglinton describes as \"among the most\nfavourable and decisive which have appeared.\" The extent of my\nizedbyGoogle\n\f408 The PoBBibilities 01 Mal-Observation, tl:c.\nknowledge on this subject at that time will be found described by\nmyself in Light, August 21st, 1886, as follows:-\nI went to Mr. Eglinton on June 30th, 1884, and I do not remember\never having previously performed a single conjuring trick &I applied to slate-\nwriting, and also the question of conjuring in any other form had in no way\ninterested me. Previously to my second ~ce, October 9th, 1884, I made\nlOme three or four attempts with a thimble, pencil, and a slate held under\nthe table, and with a trick alate made of card-board, with a movable flap and\nblotting-paper.\nI noticed that many persons made statements concerning my per-\nformances, as to the conditions of the production of the writing,\nwhich were just as emphatic as I made in my own reports about\nEglinton, and I also noticed that nearly all these statements were\nentirely wrong. Even when I sometimes revealed the fact that I was\nmerely a conjurer, the reply which I frequently received was something\nof this kind: \"Yes,you may say it is conjuring, but it could not have been\ndone by that means when I did so-and-so\" (describing a supposed test)\n\"and yet we got the writing all the same.\" The following extract\nfrom a letter to me is typical of the views taken by several of my\ninvestigators :-\nI certainly think your alate-writing quite equal to what we saw at\nNottingham-place [with Eglinton], but till I see how it is done, and it is\nthoroughly explained to me, I cannot give up my belief that you yourself\nemploy more than Bleight of hand for your results. You see I am a St.\nThomas.\nAs I went on I was gradua.lly forced to the conviction that\nmy own reports about Eglinton were just as unreliable as these\nstatements about myself, although I was not then aware of the\nserious discrepancies between them which Mr. Hodgson has lately\npointed out in the J01JA\"1lIJJ, (October and November, 1886).1 In\n1 A critic, .. C. C. M.,\" says in LigAt, January 22nd, 1887 :_CC Of coune in\nvery many cases the modw operandi could and would be explained, at least\nprivately to the witnesses, to their complete satisfaction. These would be\nreally trick cases, as to which the antecedent reports will always have some\nevidential defect, discoverable by a careful critique without any presumption at\nvariance with the distinct and definite statements of the witnesses (except in\nthe case of witnesses whose veracity, or capacity for ordinary observation, is\nquestionable), and such, therefore, as would not be adduced in any judicioUl\nselection of evidence to prove the genuine phenomena.\" Now, in a previoua\nnumber of LigAt (August 14th, 1886) Mr. C. C. Massey asserted, concerning\nlOme of my testimony to Eglinton's performances, that cc there is no room for\nthe hypothesis of innocent misdescription, which might afterwards come to be\nrecognised as such by the witness himself.\" I believe, nevertheless, that the\nperformances of Eglinton, which I endeavoured to record, WAre due to trickery\nDigitized by ~oo8le\n\fExperimental Investigation. 409\nconsequence of the change which was taking place in my opinion,\nI wrote, on July 30th, 1885, to Mr. Farmer, requesting him for\n\"private reasons,\" not to make any reference to myself, eithflr\ndirectly or indirectly, in the work about Eglinton ('TwiJ:e Two\nWorlds), which he was then preparing for the press.\nFrom a study of various exposures of slate.-writing mediums, and\nother incidents which have heen privately brought to my notice, I\ncannot now entertain a doubt that they have frequently practised\ndeception; and whether it is a fact that they, nevertheless, occasionally\nobtain the help of \"spiritual\" beings, or manifest supernormal powers,\nis a question upon which I have good reasons for being now very\nsceptical, though I do not of course profess to know how ull the\nslate-writing tricks are performed. Indeed, only last month (February,\n1887), I was informed of a special nwdus operandi employed by an\nAmerican medium, Mrs. Simpson; this method was entirely unknown\nto me, nor do I think I should have discovered it myself.\nUntil recently I had not endeavoured to obtain written reports\nfrom persons who sat with me, and I was desirous of obtaining them\nunder as nearly as possible the same conditions, as regards the mental\nattitude of the sitters, as those obtained by professional mediums for\nslate-writing; I did not wish people to know with absolute certaiuty\nby my own professions beforehand, that the slate-writing was only con-\njuring, though I urged them to treat me as a conjurer, to use tests,\nand take precautions against trickery, &c. Few persons would\nimagine how difficult it is for ordinary witnesses to accurately record a\n\"slate-writing\" seance, even if they are very careful and quick observers;\nand how prone the majority of witnesses are to exaggerate or distort\nrecords of events which they believe to be of an abnormal character.\nIn consequence of the prominence given in certain quarters to my\nname in connection with \"slate-writing,\" I assumed the professional!\nname of David Clifford. The desirability of this step may'be illustrated\nby the following incident: A short time ago, at a seance, I met a\ngentleman who spoke in very disparaging tones of the performances of\na certain amateur conjurer known as Mr. A., and who remarked to the\neffect that the statements of Mrs. Sidgwick (Proceedi'tl.{\/B, Part X,\non his part, and that my reports, adduced by Mr. Massey in his \"judicious\nselection of evidence,\" were vitiated by\" innocent misdescription.\" I think it\nnot at all unlikely that I was guilty of the amount of misdescription\nhypothetically attributed to me by Mr. Hodgson, because precisely similar\nmisdescriptions have been given of my own performances by witn_ whose\nintelligence and acumen are certainly not inferior to miue, and whose veracity\nis unquestionable.\n1 By the use of this term I do not mean to imply that I have ever demanded\nany fee for a sllance; I have never accepted any recompense whatsoe)'fll'. I\nDigitized by ~008 e\n\f410 The Po88ibilities of MaL-Observation; etc.\npp. 67-70) as to this conjurer's powers did not in the least explain the\nsubject of \"psychography.\" At the conclusion of my performance\nthis same gentleman (who knew me only under the name of Clifford)\ndeclared in my presence, and in that of his co-investigators, that the\nexperiments he had just witnessed were more conclusive as to the\nexistence of supernormal phenomena than those he had witnessed in\nthe presence of a well-known professional medium. Had he then\nknown I was Mr. A., the\" amateur conjurer,\" I do not think he would\nhave shown such enthusiasm as regards the\" incomparable\" nature of\nmy phenomena.\nIn some of the reports which I received I was described as Mr. _0\\..,\nand in several others as Mr. Clifford; in these ca.ses I have substi-\ntuted my real name, for the sake of clearness.\nI think it would be no easy task to expose an expert in slate-\nwriting, provided he had made up his mind not to give his investigators\nthe chance of doing so. A practised conjurer in this particular branch\nof his profession soon acquires a sufficiently keen insight into character\nto know when there is no risk of detection. If the performer has any\nreason to think that any part of his trick will be seen, he can take\nrefuge in a blank seance; nor would it generally be the case that if\nthe trick were partly performed the observance of strict conditions by\nthe sitter would result not merely in failure, but in exposure, as Mr.\nMassey seems to suggest. (Proceedings, Part X, pp. 93, 94.) I have,\nseveral times, had to deal with this danger, and have always been success-\nful.l Of course, ca.ses will arise when, if the right steps are taken by the\nsitter, exposure will result; and this is precisely what has happened on\nmore than one occasion, with, for example, Dr. Sla.de. There is one\ndanger to which I think a conjurer is liable, unless he is very careful, viz.,\nto give too little credit to the shrewdness of a sitter, just as he probably\noften gives too much. The remedy obviously would be to increase the\nnumber of entirely blank seances. If I were forced to giye blank\nseances to persons of whose keenness I was afraid, I should, of course,\nfrequently give blank seances to others whom I had no reason to fear,\nand with whom I could produce marvellous phenomena whenever I liked.\nI have found, moreover, that a blank sitting occa.sionally, with an in-\nvestigator who at other times gets good results, .makes the phenomena\nlook more mysterious than ever, and forms an additional reason in his\nmind for not attributing the phenomena to conjuring. A plan, I under\u00b7\nstand, that is very frequently adopted by a well-known American\nmedium, is to simulate sometimes, in a very marked manner, the ap-\nI Since the above was written, an incident has occurred which some of my\nreaders will probably think an exception; it happened at a sitting with Mr.\nDodds, anti I will refer to it in my comments upon his report.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fExpeM!lnental I nVeJltigation. 411\npearance of trickery in his slate-writing. Not unfrequentlyone of his\ninvestigators falls into the trap, observes what he supposes is a clear\ncase of deception, and demands an instant exposure of the slate.\nThe medium then protests against the \"unwarrantable suspicion,\" and\nfinally reveals the slate, to the chagrin of his would-be exposer, who of\ncourse finds it perfectly clean. Then, by a subtle process, the medium\ndoes write on the slate, to the subsequent amazement of his witness.\nFrom the account of a recent exposure by a lady Spiritualist in America,\nwho detected Slade in the very act of writing, I understand that the\nspeed with which he wrote on a slate held under the table greatly\nastonished the observer. I have good authority for belieTing that\nthe account is to be relied upon. (See New York Sunday Times, July\n5th, 1885.)\nI may now briefly refer to the argument that\" psychography\" must\nbe of an abnormal (or supernormal) character, since conjurers have been\nunable to explain the phenomena. My own opinion, as that of an\namateur conjurer, has been claimed in its favour, but I have already\npointed out that this is only a misrepresentation of the facts of the\ncase, and that I was a deficient observer, and an ignoramus as regards\nconjuring, when I wrote the reports favourable to Eglinton. At the\nsame time, I understand that certain conjurers have professed their\ninability to explain the slate-writing of some mediums by conjuring.\nBut, after my own experiences, I am not at all surprised at this. That\nthe testimony of a specially skilled conjurer in tit-is particular branch is\nof value I do not deny, yet at the same time it does not, I think,\nfollow that he must therefore know all the secrets, such as one with\nmore experience might have acquired. If he is very confident of his\nown ability to find out any trick and cannot explain the fTl()(],us operandi\nof the mediulll, he may possibly think it inexplicable by conjuring;\nand the remarks made by Mrs. Sidgwick at the close of her article in\nthe Journal of the S.P.R. for December are particularly suitable to a case\nof this kind. A very good instance of this has come under my notice.\nWhen Eglinton was in Calcutta, Mr. Harry Kellar, a professional I\nconjurer, requested the \" opportunity of participating in a. seance, with\na view of giving an unbiassed opinion as to whether,\" in his \"capacity\nof a professional prestidigitateur,\" he could\" give a natural explanation\nof effects said to be produced by spiritual aid.\" Eglinton eventually\nmet Mr. Kellar, and the result was that Mr. Kellar came away utterly\nunable to explain by any natural means the phenomena that he\nwitnessed; and he said that the writing on the slate, \"if my senses are\nto be relied on, was in no way the result of trickery or sleight of hand.\"\nThis occurred early in 1882, and Mr. Kellar's opinion still continues to\nbe quoted in favour of the genuineness of Eglinton's phenomena. Yet\nI am not aware that Mr. Kellar, before sitting with Eglinton, had any\nDigi\n\f412 The Possibilities of Mal-Observation, Icc.\nspecial knowledge of the different methods of producing slate-writing\nby conjuring, and I have little doubt, after reading his account of a\nsitting in 1882, quoted in Light, October 16th, 1886, p. 481, that he\nwas ignorant of at least some of these methods. But this does not seem\nto be my own view only; it seems to be that of Mr. Kellar himself,\nwho since then has apparently turned his attention to slate-'Nl\"iting,\nand has changed his former opinion about the genuineness of the\nphenomena; he now professes to be able to \"duplicate any perform-\nance given by mediums of whatever nature after he has seen it done\nthree times.\" This was mentioned to me by an American gentlema.n\nwhom I met recently, but I have also seen a notice of it in Light for\nMarch 28th, 1885, p. 147, from which I have taken the above extract;\nyet Mr. Kellar's former opinion, given, as I presume, when he was not\na special expert in slate-writing, is continually quoted by Spiritualists,\njust as my own opinion, given when I was absolutely incompetent and\nknew next to nothing about conjuring in any form whatever, has been\nquoted as the opinion of a specially qualified conjurer.\nI do not myself place much value upon the opinion of conjurers who\nhave not previously become thoroughly versed in the ways of deceiving\nsitters in slate-writing; not only because of this incident in which\nperhaps Mr. Kellar's over-confidence in his own powers of detection\nled him into a mistake, although he has after long experience publicly\nproclaimed his disbelief in \"mediumistic\" phenomena, but also because\nI haye myself been able to deceive a gentleman accomplished in general\nconjuring.\nOn August 26th, 1886, I received a letter from a well-known pnr\nfessional conjurer, whose programme includes several exposes of alleged\nspiritualistic frauds. In his letter to me this gentleman 1 informed me\nthat he had heard a great deal about my slate-writing, and was most\nanxious to witness the phenomena, as he had had seances with a well-\nknown professional medium; and he politely requested an interview\nwith me. He was a stranger to me personally, but I at once offered to\ngive him a soonce, which was arranged for September 13th, 1886. At\nthe conclusion of the seance 2 he gave me his testimony as follt)ws:-\nSeptember 13th, 1886.\nI can see no explanation by trickery of the experiments in slate-writing I\nhave seen performed by Mr. Davey this evening.\n(Signed)....- - -\n1 I have not here disclosed his name, as, since I have informed him of my\nconjuring powers, he has desired me net to do so. The names and addres8es\nof all the writers of statements and reports are in the hands of the Hon. Secre-\ntary of the S.P.R.\n2 I had a curious experience with this gentleman. I asked him to think of\na number. A number which I thought would be right was then, without his\nknowledge, marked on the slate by my process. I thenr4l'ked lJim to tell me\nized byLIoogle\n\fExperimental Investigation. 413\nSome days afterwards he wrote to me as follows :-\nSeptember24th, 1886.\nIt gives me much pleasure to add my testimony to that of many others\nyou have, and I certainly can state that in some mysterious manner\nwhich to me seemed quite inexplicable, writing appeared on slates which I\nhad purchased myself, which had been previously thoroughly wasluJd,\nand while they were held together apparently very tightly. And it was\nspecially remarkable that the writing was in the very colour I asked for.\n(Signed)'---\nAnother professional conjurer was shown my locked slate by an\ninvestigator, the writing having been allowed to remain, and on hearing\nthe account of the witness, he offered an explanation, which was, how-\never, entirely wrong; I instance h~s opinion merely for the sake of\npointing out that his great knowledge of conjuring in general did not\nenable him to suggest an explanation which would I think have occur-\nred to him if he had been skilled in the various special methods that\nmay be used by conjurers in connection with slate-writing.\nIt has sometimes happened that an inv~tigator, who knew before-\nhand that my performances were conjuring, has thought he had\nobtained a clue to my methods, but in nearly every case where I have\nsuspected this, I think his discovery has only tended to perplex him\nmore than ever. Whilst visiting Professor Henry Sidgwick at\nCambridge some few months ago, I gave both Professor Sidgwick and\nMrs. Sidgwick two seances for slate-writing. Amongst other\nphenomena, I obtained an answer on my locked slate, written under-\nneath the question Professor Sidgwick had written. I had requested\nProfessor Sidgwick to keep special charge of the slate. He afterwards\nconcluded I had obtained some means of opening and writing on it,\nand he informed me as to when and how he thought I had done this.\nIt is interesting to note that I did not in any way perform the trick in\nthe manner Professor Sidgwick surmised, as I have since proved to\nhim; he has informed me that my explanation was \"completely\nunexpected,\" and he says:-\nI was so satisfied with my own conjecture (difficult as it was for me to\nimagine it actuallyrealised) that the method you actually used never occurred\nto me-nor anything at all like it.\nthe number he had thought of. He said 98. I lifted up the slate and showed\nhim the figures 98 that had been written before he had spoken. This may of\ncourse have been merely an odd coincidence, but the fact that I have had\nseveral somewhat similar experiences with other investigators led me to think\nthat there might be something of the nature of thought-reading in it. I\nendeavoured to arrange some further experiments with Mr. --, but his many\nengagements, and afterwards my serious illness, prevented our meeting\nagain.\nDigi\n\f414 The Possibilities of MaJ,-Observation, J:c.\nTo those of my readers who are specially interested in the sul:~ect.\nI may recommend a book entitled The Bottom Facts of SpiritUal1Ym,1\nby Mr. John W. Truesdell, who seems to have had considerable\nexperience in slate-writing. He gives an interesting account in\nChapter XVI. of a slate-writing seance recorded by Mr. L. W. Chu:e, of\nCleveland, Ohio, and I have no doubt, after my own experiences as a\nproducer of slate-writing, that Mr. Truesdell's subsequent versiolll of\nthe matter is the true one. In the Daily Cowrier of Syracuse, Ne...\nYork, December 7th, 1872, Mr. L. W. Chase made the following\nstatements :-\nThe medium (Mr. John W. Trueadell) then took up a common a1&te,\nand, after carefully washing oft\" either side, placed it fiat upon the table,\nwith a bit of pencil, about the size of a pea, underneath. We then joined\nhands, and after the lapse of about ten minutes, under the full glare of\ngas-light, we could distinctly see the slate undulate, and hear the communi-\ncation that was being written, a copy of which I herewith append :-My dear\nBrother,-You strive in vain to unlock the hidden mysteries of the future.\nNo mortal has faculties to comprehend infinity.-CBARLOrl'E.\nThe above lines were not only characteristic of my beloved sister while\nin the form, but the handwriting 80 closely resembled hers that, to my mind,\nthere cannot be a shadow of doubt as to its identity.\nIn reference to a further event, Mr. L. W. Chase adds :-\nA short communication from my mother (and in her own handwriting)\nwas found plainly written.\nI have quoted the above extracts since they serve to show how a\nperson may be deceived in the matter of spirit identity; for Mr. John W.\nTruesdell, at the close of Chapter XVI., frankly informs his readers\nthat he himself wrote the meBB&ges, and describes the methods he\nemployed. The resemblance between the handwritings was, I presume,\nimaginary.\nThe fact that \"messages\" occasionally contain private family\ndetails, &c., is often quoted as a proof of the Spiritualistic theory in\nconnection with slate-writing, but many perSODB would be surprised to\nfind how frequently a slate-writing conjurer may become possessed of\napparently private matters in connection with his investigators, and they\nshould also not forget that peculiar chance coincidences sometimes occur.\nIt is not very long since I met a gentleman who was a perfect stranger\nto me personally, and I depicted scenes to him that I knew had taken\nplace many years ago, with an accuracy that utterly bewildered him, and\nI went into such private details of his family matters as convinced him\nI had a strange insight into his past life. Yet this was merely due to a\nchance coincidence. Some months previously these and other details\n1 Published by Carleton and Co., New York.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fExperimental Investigation. 415\nhad been incidentally mentioned to me by a person well acquainted\nwith his history, and although he was not a public character, his name,\nin connection with the events of which I bad heard, became somehow\nfixed in my memory. Nor is this the only experience I have had of a\nsomewhat similar nature.\nTben it must be borne in mind that when witnesses become\ndeeply impressed with the wonder of the performance, they not un-\nfrequently give way to a little natural excitement, and whilst they\nhave laboured under the excitement I have picked up items of informa-\ntion from the witnesses themselves, which when reproduced by me at\nfuture seances have been declared\" wonderful tests.\"\nDuring the past few months I have given seances to many total\nstrangers who have applied to me for sittings. In some cases I have\ngiven these performances away from my own residence, and I have\nrequested the investigators to use all possible caution to guard against\nany trickery, leaving them, howeVf~r, to make their own suppositions\nconcerning the mode of production of the phenomena. Latterly I have\nstipulated that the sitters should write out reports as soon as possible\nafterwards; and upon receiving these reports I have informed them\nwithout delay that the phenomena were only conjuring. Formerly in\nsome cases I had given the sittings over and over again to the same\npersons, with an occasional blank to stimulate their curiosity; neverthe-\nless they never detected the modU8 operandi.\nI shall now give nearly 1 all the accounts that I have received, but\nbefore doing so I wish my readers to be clearly aware that the writing\nperformances described in the following records were due to my own\nunaided powers as a \"slate-writing\" conjurer. Two years ago I\nshould have questioned the power of a conjurer to produce such records\nfrom ordinary witnesses as those which I now append, and that others\nshared my doubt in this respect is, I think, apparent from the follow-\ning Editorial Note in Light, September 4th, 1886.\nR he [Mr. Davey], or any other conjurer, can produce the a~earance\nof the conditions which he seemed to observe with Mr. Eglinton, and the\nwriting under such a~arent conditions, BO as to induce an inexperienced\n1 The only reports which I have not quoted are two by Mrs. Sidgwick, one\nby Mr. Hodgson, and three others. These last three resembled the majority of\nthose which I have quoted; two of the writers desired me not to print their\nreports at all; the third desired me not to print his report unless it was a correct\naccount of what occurred at the sitting. Mrs. Sidgwick was not only aware\nthat I was a conjurer, but I had told her a good deal about my tricks before my\nfirst seance with her. Mr. Hodgson was also aware that I was a conjurer, and\nhad some knowledge beforehand of my modus operandi; his report was written\nchiefly for comparison with an account promised by the gentleman to whom I\nhave referredon pp. 409-10 as having exhibited such enthusiasm, but who, unfor-\ntunately, notwithsiia.nding my repeated reqnests, has never sentme aJll'reIlO.Qlr\nDigitized by ~OUOle\n\f416 The Possibilities of Mal-Observation, tl:c.\nwitnesa to write such a report aa thOle he wrote himself, it will be time\nenough to talk of mal-observation aa a poBIIible explanation.\nI shall begin by quoting a few brief statements of a general kind\nmerely in illustration of the impressions left upon some of those from\nwhom I did not exact a detailed report. V\nStatemetlt of MR. A. PODIIORB.\nJ1dy, 1886.\nA few weeks ago Mr. D. gave me a &nee, and to the best of my\nrecollection the following waa the result. Mr. D. gave me an ordinary\nschool slate, which I held at one end, he at the other, with our left hands;\nhe then produced a double slate, hinged and locked. Without removing my\nleft hand I unlocked the slate, and at Mr. D.'s direction, placed three\nsmall pieces of chalk-red, green, and grey-inside; I then relocked the\nslate, placed the key in my pocket, and the slate on the table in such a\nposition that I could eaaily watch both the slate in my left hand, and the\nother on the table. After some few minutes, during which, to the best of\nmy belief, I waa attentively regarding both slates, Mr. D. whisked the first\naway, and showed me on the reverse a message written to myself. Almost\nimmediately afterwards he aaked me to unlock the second slate, and on\ndoing so I found to my intense aatonishment, another meBBage written on\nboth the inBldes of the slate-the lines in alternate colours, and the chalks\napparently much worn by usage.\nMy brother 1 tells me that there waa an interval of some two or three\nminutes during which my attention waa called away, but I can only believe\nit on his word.\nAuSTIN PODIIORB.\nBtaf.emetlt of MRs. JOHNSON.\nMy sisters and I being most interested in the subject of slate-writing and\nanxious to see something of it, Mr. Davey kindly arranged a meeting at his\nhouse. We sat at an ordinary table in a well-lighted room, and writing was\nquickly produced on the inner surface of one of two slates held firmly\ntogethel', once by Mr. Davey and myself, at other tinles by my sistenand Mr.\nDavey j at tint just under the edge of the table, then above, and afterwards on\none of my sister's shoulden.

You opened the Blate, cleaned it perfectly free from\nwriting, put two or three piecea of crayon or pencil therein, locked it up, and\nplaced the key in the handB of one of my daughtera, who WaB present. The\nslate WaB laid on the table, and the banda of all of us were placed on and\naround it. You then told us to think of some subject upon which we should\nlike a few lines, and to say the colour in which we should like them to appear.\nThis was left to one of my daughtera. You then appeared to be invoking\nthe aid of some unknown person, which appeared to be attended with con-\nsiderable mental agitation to YOUrielf, and a Blight scratohing WaB heard, and\nupon the slate being finally unlocked and opened, two or three linea of writing\nappeared therein, and they were upon the subject my daughter had lent her\nmind, and in the colour writing desired by us.\nThe next thing you did WaB to solicit us to take out any volume from your\nbookcaae, tum to a page, and fix our special attention on a paBB&ge. This I\ndid without your seeing the page or paBB&ge. The book WaB banded to you,\nand you in a Bhort time told us the right page and right paragraph.\nI can only say that my daughtera and myself were perfectly aBtonished\nwith your performance, and had we been predisposed to believe in\nSpiritualism, we should have been convinced in Buch belief through your\nseance, aB the whole performance seemed to us a phenomenon incapable of any\nexplanation and not to be produced by any ordinary natural means.-Youra\nfaithfully,\nR.

When it was unlocked and the alate examined,\nI discovered. to my astonishment, that it wall written all over from top to\nbottom. I never 100t sight of the locked alate, and I never 100t light of\nyou; and as far as I could judge, it wall impoaaible for you or anyone\npresent to have done it ; yet the wonderful fact remains; the aIate wall\nperfectly clean when it Wal locked up, and written all over when nnlocked.\nThis is a mystery, and aI I am unable to look through a wooden oover, I\ncannot imagine a clue to it.

Apparently he hal no appliances. I Wal seated with him at a small\ntable when he gave me the following altounding evidence of his powers. He\ngave into my handa a alate which, when locked, looks like an ordinary box.\nThis box I opened, waahed the alate, locked it, and took the key ; for lOme\nminutes we II\\t, he with one hand on mine, his other hand on the table.\nPresently a faillt acratching 1I'aI heard. and continued lOme little time; when\nit cealed Mr. Davey unlocked the alate, and 10 ! it wu covered with clear.\ndistinct writing-a letter addreaaed to myself, and stating if I would wait a\nlittle while the writer would go to the Cape and bring me news of my\nbrother. Then I again walhed the slate; again it wall locked, and again I\nkept the key. Mr. Davey then BIked me to take any volume I liked from\nthe library, to look at a page and remember the number of it. This I did,\nand again we II\\t aI before. In a few moments the alate wu unlocked, when\non it Wal written, not only the number of the page I had thought of, but\nlOme of the worda which were on the self-lI\\me page, and these not ordinary\nwords, but abstruse words, aI the book I selected Wal a learned one. This I\nconaidered a mOlt marvellous feat, and utterly incomprehenaible. That the\nscientific researches of my friend will lead to mOlt important reaulta I have\nno doubt. His aim is to expoee deception, and if this object be attained he\nwill benefit aociety and thl'OW light on a subject which hal hi'herto been\nconsidered to belong exclusively to the \" powers of darkneaa.\"\nE.

Mr. Limmer had had a successful s~ance with me some\nmonths previously, of which he wrote no account.\n1. Report of MR. RAIT.\nOn Wednesday evening, the 8th September, 1886, at 7.30, I betook my-\nself, in answer to a previous invitation, to the residence of Mr. S. J. Davey.\nI had brought with me at his request three new common school slates\nprivately marked by me and of medium size, a box of assorted crayons, and\na book to take notes in. Arrived there I was introduced to Mr. Limmer,\nwho with Mr. Davey and myself formed the trio in whose presence the\nmanifestations which I am about to record took place.\nAt 8.30 p.m. we seated ouraelves as shown in the diagram.

During the whole seance, with but one slight exception, the gas was\nburning brightly.\n2. The slates used were the 3 already mentioned and a double one of\nMr. Davey's of superior make, with ebony backs and fitted with a lock,\nwhich, after having cleaned it and inserted a small fragment of slate pencil, I\nlocked, and at his request put it in the pocket of my coat, where it remained\ntill used. With these slates there could not possibly be any tampering,1\nas during the whole seance they never for one moment left the room.\n* I have numbered the sittings in the order in which I have quoted them,\nand have also lettered the chief events described in each, so that where more\nthan one account is given of the same sitting, the reader may easily compare\nthe different descriptions given. The small index numbers refer to notes which\n\"\"ill be found in the Appendix, pp. 487\u00b795. f\":~ I\nizedb~k'g e\n\f420 The Po88ibilitie8 of Mal-Observat-um, &c.\n3.

I watched Mr.l>avey while seemingly talking to Mr.\nLimmer, but could detect nothing suspicious in his movements ; three dis-\ntinct ticks were heard and I put the slate on the table and examined it. It\nwas written in the same indistinct hand, and began with a scrawl, but in the\nmiddle of the sentence I could decipher \"nine\" plainly. On asking Mr.\nLimmer to look at his watch he replied that it wanted a quarter of an hour\nto 9.\n[d,eJl On putting the question\" Will there be a war with Russia 1\"\nwe got the vague reply \"PerhapB.\" In reply to other questions the answers\nobtained were\" try chalk\" (this refers to the difficulty experienced in dis-\ntinctly writing on a new slate) and \"answer later.\"\nSo far nothing striking had occurred beyond very scrawly writing, and\nreplies which might mean anything; but something better was in store\nfor us.\n[g] I now suggested' a slight va,riation in the experiment, which both Mr.\nLimmer and Mr. Davey agreed to. I will mention however that in the\nright-handed breast pocket of my coat I had placed a sealed envelope con-\ntaining some questions of a most impossible nature, and which I had written\nen the afternoon of the 7th September, intending to produce them at the\nseance with a view to getting them answered ; they being all the time in the\nenvelopo and their contents unknown to anyone but myself. I determined\ntherefore to put the question, \"What does the right-handed breast pocket\nof my coat contain1\"\nRequested by Mr. Davey to clean and again privately mark my slates, I\ndid so ; and at his request Mr. Limmer and I chose 3 fragments of chalk,-\npink, green, and blue. These 3 fragments were placed on the surface of one\nof the slates. I then placed another slate on the top of this so that the\nchalks were between.7 This time the slates were abollll the table; we joined\nhands and began talking, the question concerning my cost pocket having\nbeen put. It is important to note that during this experiment both of Mr.\nDavey's hands were in view, also that the writing began almost instan-\ntaneously on joining hands. Mr. Davey became very agitated, his hands\nslightly trembled under mine, and he occasiOllally gasped for breath as\nthough in pain. (These fits occurred at intervals throughout the seance and\nalways when the writing was taking place, but on no occasion did he move\neither his hands or feet.) The writing distinctly continued, cool, deliberate,\nand steady. I could even hear the occasional dashes as in stroking the t's,\n&c.; it invariably seemed to come, away fromMr. Davey, immediatelyunder-\nneath my fingers. I could almost feel the chalk as it moved along ill its\nweird progress, guided by what mysterious agency I know not.\nAll at once Mr. Davey said, \"Quick ! ! in what colour will you have it\nwritten 1\" Pink was chosen. This is what appeared on lifting one slate\nofl':-\nDUB SIB,-This experiment is a very difficult one, and we can but\nrarely repeat it.

Part of the nleuage we could not\ndecipher, and I accordingly cannot repeat it in full. This meuage occupied\nabout 2 minutes or 1811 in writing, and wu on the whole fairly well written.\n[h] The next experiment wu with Mr. Davey'l closed llate. After it had\nbeen produced' from my pocket we laid it on the table locked and with the\nImall piece of pencil inside, joined handl u before and the question 1rBI\nput, .. Will the Emperor of Germany live through tqe present year f \"8\nImmediately the writing began, exactly the same u on previoua occaaioDl,\nand when after the lpace of 4 minutes (about) I carefully unlocked the alate\nwe found the following wonderful meuage: \"My Dear SirI,- It is a\npopular error that if we can produce this writing under these conditiona we\nmight at the same time have a knowledge upon all queltions of a mundane\nnature.

Yet for ouraelvea we can\nforesee much to happen in in the year 1889, and to do this we need but carry\nout the instructionl of Bonnet(1) who said, 'Ne voua laaaez jamaia d'examiner\nlea c&uaea dea grands changements, puiaque rien ne lervita jamaia tant a.veltre\ninstruction.'

This is clearly a direct\nreply to all our queltions, and \"the levere telt\" referred to, points evidently\nto my coat pocket's c(mUnU. What the mYlterions VII. means I do not know,\nexcept that it may have lOme allUlion to the 7th September, the day on\nwhich I wrote the queltiona. This belief is strengtheuedll by the anawer we\ngot in trying to find out the writing after the Roman letters VII, later on in\nthe evening, and which read (u Dluch u we could make out of it) &ptem.\nThis long measage wu to my mind the mOlt marvelloUi result of all, and ita\neffect was Itrongly marked on Mr. Davey, who leemed in a ltate of great\nprostration, and called for a glUl of water.\n[i, k] Mr. Davey then placed a alate on two BlUaU boxes which rested on\nthe table, thUi j 3 piecel of cltalk,-blue, pink, and red-were then chosen\nand placed on its surface (the llate) and over the chalk wu placed a tumbler;\ntho gu wu llightly lowered, and we were told to say what fur\\WJ :we would\nDigitized by ~o'O(5.e\n\fEaperimental Investigation. 423\nlike to have drawn. I chose an octagon, Mr. Limmer chose a square. I saw\na piece of chalk slightly move and on lifting the glasa we saw two very indis-\ntinct marks. We however re.solved to try again. This time the red piece of\nchalk distinctly moved, but very quick. Lifting the tumbler we found this\nfigure I which evidently was iRtended for part of Mr. Limmer's\n-\nsquare.\n[Z, m, n] I desired10 after this to have the writing on the double slate of\nMr. Davey's continued at the point where it had been broken oft', and\nobtained this result on one of my slates which I held undemeath the table\nand which began immediately. \"We hope to see you again-Joey.\" I\nwas also anxious to know what the VII signified as I have already said\nbefore ;-on the first attempt we got the answer-\" good-bye Joey \"-but\nwe were more aucceBBful on again putting the question, the result being a.\ndistinct\" Septe---\" ; whether, as I have already said, it was intended\nfor September I cannot teU.\nAs it was getting late (10.30) the .eance concluded. In finishing this\nstatement I will add that for my. part I am .. an outsider,\" have\nnever before given alate-writing or Spiritualism a thought until Mr.\nDavey lent me \"Psychography\" and a copy of Light dated 8th\nNovember, 1884, and invited me to relate my experiences as t.hey\nappeared to my senses of Bight and hearing only; which I have\nendeavoured to do in as complete a manner as poBBible. What the agency is\nthat moves the fragment of pencil I know not; I leave that for the 8a11anu.\nIt is a wonderful thing that part of an answer was written in French, a\nlanguage totally unknown11 to Mr. Davey. Also that 3 colours were employed\nin writing another answer. Tric)ery to my mind is utterly impossible in any\nrespect.

The proceed-\nings then commenced by placing a common Blate, bought that evening and\nmarked by Mr. Rait, under the comer of the table and BuppOrted in that\nposition by the right and left hands of Mr. Da\\'ey and Mr. Rait respectively,\nwhile I completed the circle by holding their disengaged hands.\n[c, c] The question\" What is the time 7\" was then asked by Mr. Rait,\nand after a ahort interval I diatinctly heard writing, but on looking at the\nslate the answer was not readable: the queBtion was therefore repeated, and\nshortly after the word .. nine\" was obtained.\n[d, e, f] The next question asked by Mr. Rait Was'Di~i~ilYQK~9~~~\n\f424, The P088ibilities of Mal-Observation, &c.\nwar with Ruuia or not 1\" in reply to which we received the wonl\n\" Perhapa.\" The laDle gentleman then asked \u2022\u2022 Will the Emperor of\nGermany live through the year 1\" lnatead of receiving a direct reply the\nworda \"Try chalk\" were found written upon the aIate, and on adopting\nthat 8ugge8tion we obtained the 8ingle word .. later.\"\nI may mention here that all the chalk and 8lates (with the exception of\nthe\" locked slate\" mentioned later on in this report) used during the even-\ning were brought by Mr. Rait, and had never been in the poueuion of Mr.\nDavey.\n[g] The next test W&8 that of two common slates being placed uporl the\ntable, one above the other, the frames of which fitud 80 accurately that it\nappeared utterly impouible to insert anything by which the pencil could\nbe put in motion. These 8lates were previol18ly examined by Mr. Bait and\nmyself. Green, pink, blue and red chalk having been inserted by Mr. Rait,\nthe circle W&8 again formed in the manner before deecribed, Mr. Davey\nhaving this time, though, both hands placed upon the top slate. The question,\n\"What does my right hand breast coat pocket contain 1\" W&8 put by Mr.\nBait, and it W&8 agreed that the colour in which the anawer should be written\n8hould be pink. I diatinctly heard the chalk pauing rapidly between the\nslates, and in about two minute8 we had the following meBAge before ua.\n(In pink)\n\"DUB Sm,\n\"This experiment ia a very di1Bcult one, and we can but rareIy\n\u2022\u2022 repeat it.

We will try and\n\" anawer your question later on, and the (word not readable) endeavour to\n.. convince (word not readable) any test you may 8uggest.\n\" ERNEST.\"\nAt this stage of the proceedings Mr. Davey appeared to be rather\nexhausted, and drank a gl&18 of water.\n[11.] Mr. Davey then produced a \"locked slate,\" which I examined moat\nminutely, and &8 far &8 I W&8 able to judge, the surfaces were genuine slate\nADd had not undergone any proceu of preparation which would aid him in\nobtaining writing. A 8mall crumb of pencil W&8 inserted, and the slate\nclosed and locked by Mr. Rait. The key W&8 then given into my pOlll8llion.\nWe then placed our hands in an exactly simiIar position &8 before, and\nMr. Rait having repeated the question\" Will the Emperor of Germany live\nthrough the year 1\" I very lOOn heard the pencil travelling ovor the surface\nof the slate. After the lapse of about four minutes the slate W&8 carefully\nunlocked by Mr. Bait, and the 11 pencil very much worn WII8 found at the\nplace where the writing ended.\nThe lines on the first side of the 81ate ran in a diagonal direction from left\nto right, but on tho 8econd side it:w&8 done in the usual manner, i.Il., from\nBide to side. The writing W&8 of a very neat character and the majority of\nthe letters were well fonned. The following is a copy of the letter.\n\"MyDuR SIRB,-It is a popular error that if we can produce this writing\n.. under these conditiona we might at the 8&nle time have arImn-.JMgp upon all\nDigitized by-\\JUU(Sl'-\n\fExperimental Investigation. 425\n.. questions of a mundane nature.

Within a period of\n15 seconds from the time of asking such question and after completing the\ncircle with our hands, the words \"to see you again, Joey,\" were written.\nThe two slates were again placed in the aame position as before, and Mr.\nRait having put an unimportant question, after the completion of the circle as\nbefore, I aaw upon the slate\" Good-bye, Joey\" ; but on a second trial a\nscrawl was obtained which looked very much like\" Sept. Joey\" but it was\nimpoaaible to aay definitely what it was intended for.\n[i,j, k] The final test to which Mr. Davey was subjected was that of\nwriting under an inverted tumbler under the following conditions. An\nordinary tumbler was inverted and placed upon one of the slates brought by\nMr. &it. This slate was raised slightly from the table and supported by two\nsmall boxes placed under the ends of the slate. Blue, pink, and red chalk\nwere then placed under the glau by Mr. Rait, and after joining hands, Mr.\nRait asked that an octagon should be formed with the red chalk_ After\nwaiting for a few minutes the red chalk was seon to make two short lines\nalmost at right angles to one another, thus, T The aame test, after the\nslate had been cleaned, was repeated, and with precisely the aame result. I\nthen asked that a square should be formed by the red chalk, and two sides\nof it were made almost instantly, and in the colour required. Although\n\u2022 This probably refers to BOrne questions which Mr. Rait had written and\nenclosed in a sealed envelope and placed in bis breast coat pocket and known\nonly to himself. It will be remembered he previously asked\" What does my\nright-hand breast coat pocket contain? \"-H. J. L. . ..

I\nfailed to diacover anything which could have caused it to do 10.\nI can only lay that the whole thing was totally inexplicable to me. and\nto the best of my belief it was impouible for Mr. Davey to have prodoced\nany of the above resulta by the aid of trickery, as he did not appear in any\nway to try to divert my attention either from himaelf or the elates, and 1\nwatched him as clO88lyas it was pouible throughout the whole proceedings.\nHUTNALL J. LnnoB.\nSITTING II.\nThe following three reports are by a member of the Council of the\nAmerican Society for Psychical Research, and his wife and daughter.\nI shall speak of them as Mr. and Mrs. and Misa Y. The reports ought\nto be specially instructive in consequence of the differences of attitude\nillustrated by the sitters. Mrs. Y. was unaware, until after her report\nhad been written, that the phenomena were nothing but conjuring.\nMiss Y. was unawa.re of this fact during the sitting, but I understand\ntha.t she was unintentionally informed of the true nature of my perfor-\nmances before she wrote her report. Mr. Y. was aware, before any\narrangement had been made for the sitting, of the work upon which I\nwas engaged, and knew that any phenomenon which might occur would\nbe due to my own conjuring powers.\n1. Report of MRs. Y.\nOn the evening of September 10th, 1886, 1 went with my husband and\ndaughter to a room in Furnival's Inn, to witnesa the alate-writing perfomlADces\nof Mr. Davey. On our way we stopped at a stationer's, and my husb.utd\npllrchaaed three perfectly new ordinary Ichool alatea. We found Mr.\nDavey to be a young man of manifest intelligence and great eamllstness of\nscientific purpo88. He impressed me as being thoroughly honest and above\nall trickery. HeallOunpresaed me as being in a very critical state of health,\nand I should say the nervous Itrain of his llate-writing performances was\nmost injurious to hinl.\n[a] We seated ourselves at an ordinary Pembroke table, brought out of\nthe kitchen attached to the chambers belonging to the friend who had loaned\nhis room for the occasion. A piece of chalk was placed on one of our alatea,\nand the slate was held tightly up against the underside of the table leaf by one\nof Mr. Davey's handsand one of my daughter's. Their thumbs were on top of\nthe table, and their hands spread underneath on the underside of the alate.\nI held Mr. Davey's other hand, and we all joined hands around the table.\nI watched the two hands holding the slate without a moment's intormisaion,\nand I am cottfidet.t that neither Mr. Davey's hand nor my daughter's moved\nin the least during the whole tilDe. Two or thnie questions were asked\nwithout any sign of response. l Then Mr. Davey asked rather emphatically,\nlooking hard at the comer of the table under Jrhwh ~hey were\nDigitized by ~-U081e\n\fEapeTimentol, Investigat-ion. 427\nholding the slate, \" Will you do anything for us 1\" After this question had\nbeen repeated three or four times, a scratching noise was heard, and on\ndrawing out the slate a distinct\" Yes\" was found written on it, the chalk\nbeing found stationary at the point where the writing ceased. As my eyes\nwere fixed uninterruptedly on both my daughter'S hand and on Mr.\nDavey's also, and as I certainly had fast hold of his other hand all the time,\nI feel confident he did not write this word in any ordinary way.1\n[b] This same result was obtained two or three times. But Mr. Davey\ndid not seem to think it was enough of a test, and he proposed that we\nshould try it with the slate on the table in full sight of us all, with a.\ncandle3 burning brightly in the middle of the table.\n[c] He gave me a looked slate of his own, which I thoroughly washed and\nlocked myself, and put the key in my own pocket. We then joined hands,\nand Mr. D. and my daughter placed one hand each on the slate as it was\nlying on top of the table. Different questions were asked, and we waited\nsome time, but no response came. Mr. Davey seemed to me very much\nexhausted, and I urged him to desist from any further efforts. But he\nseemed loth to do this, and said he would rest a little while, and would then,\nperhaps, be able to go on. After a short time of conversation, the slates all\nthe while being ht full view and carefully watched by me, we again tried it,\nunder the same conditions as before, only that this time Mr. D. requested\nus each to take a book at random from the shelves in the room, and mentally\nthink of two numbers representing a page and a line, and he would see if he\ncould reproduce it. This also failed of any result, and Mr. D. said he\nfeared he was too tired to produce anything, as he had been very much\nexhausted by a long and very succeasful ~ance the night before. We again\nbegged him to desist, but after a short rest, during which he walked into the\nnext room for fresh air, I thought, he insisted on another trial. The slates\nstill remained all the time in full view on the table. Mr. D. asked my\ndaughter to choose another book, which she did at random, he having his\nback to her and standing at some distance while she 4id it.4 This book was\nat once tied up and sealed by one of the party, Mr. D. never touching\nit from first to last. I then held it in my lap, while we joined hands as\nbefore, and Mr. D. and my danghter each put one hand on the slate.\nStill nothing came. Then we changed positions, and I placed my hand on\nthe slate instead of my daughter, giving her the book to hold. During tills\nchange she kept her hand on the slate until I had placed mine beside it, and\nthe book was awaiting her on the opposite side of the table, my husband all\nthe while holding Mr. D.'s other hand. I am confident that Mr. D. could\nnot poBlibly have manipulated the slate during this change, for it was\nin full sight all the while, and our hands were on it, and the book WIUI tied\nand sealed on the opposite side of the table. A few minutes after this\nreadjustment Mr. D. seemed to have a sort of electric shook pass through\nhim, the perspiration started out in great drops on'his forehead, and the\nhand that was touching mine quivered as with a nervous spasm. Atonce we\nheard the pencil in the slate moving, and in a few moments Mr. Davey\nBIked me to unlook the slate. My daughter took the key out of her pocket\nand handed it across the table to me, and I unlocked the slate, and found it\ncovered on both the inner sides with writing. When read, IlhiR_ miwr\nDigitized by G\\)v(S1t::\"\n\f428 The P088wilit\u00b7j,es of Mal-Observation, &c.\nproved to be a IOrt of euay or exhortation on the subject of peyc:hical\nresearch, with quotationa from the book ch088n intenningled throughout. I\nforgot to eay that Mr. D. had &lked us all to chOOl8 in our minds two\nnumben under ten to represent a page and a line of the book, but had finally\nconcentrated hia thought on what my husband wu thinking. In the writing\nthere were quotations from every page we had anr of us thought of, but no~\nalways the line; but in the caae of nly husband the line W&l correct, but\nnot the page. He had thought of page 8, line 8. The line WlUI quoted\nfrom page 3, and Mr. D. aaid this confusion between 8 and 3 quite\nfrequently occurred, because of the similarity of the numbere. Thia tat\nseemed to me perfect. The alate W&l under my own eye on top of the table\nthe whole time, and either my daughter's hand or my own W&l placed firmly\nupon it without the interwiaaion of even a aecond.' Moreover, we c10eed and\nopened it ouraelvea.\n[d) After a short rest, Mr. Davey &lked us to w&lh two of our own alatea\nand put them togethor, with pieces of chalk of difrerent colours between,\nand all of us to reach aeroaa the table and hold them all together. Thia we\ndid,7 and then Mr. D. &lked my husband to chOOle mentally three colours be\nwiahed uaed in writing. After all holding the alates cloeely preaaed together\nfor a few minutes, we placed them on the table, and Mr. D. and I plaeed our\nhanda on them while the rest joined handa. In a few momenta the _e\nIOrt of electric shock _med to pall through Mr. D., and hia hand and arm\nwhich were on the slates quivered nervously, and immediately a scratching\nnoiae was heard. He then &lked me to lift one slate off the other, which I\ndid, and found one side covered with writing in three colours, the very three\nmy husband had mentally chosen. I am perfectly confident that my hand\nW&l not removed' from the slates for one single inatant, and that I never lost\nsight of them for a moment.\nBy this time Mr. D. seemed to UII to be 10 much exhausted that we begged\nhim to give up any further testa, but he insiated on trying one more, which\nW&I u it proved the moat remarkable of all\n[e) He placed one of ~ur alates on three little china aalt-cellara that lifted\nit up about an inch from the table. Upon the middle of thia he placed aevera!\npieces of different coloured chalks, and covered them with a tumbler. Then he\ntold my husband to form a mental picture of lOme figure he wiahed to have\ndrawn on the alate under the glaaa, and to name aloud the colour he would have\nit drawn in. He thought of a cro.., and Ch088 aloud the blue colour.' I sug-\ngested that blue W&l too dark to be easily seen, and &lked him to take white,\nwhich he agreed to. We eat holding handa and watching the pi8C811 of chalk\nunder the tumbler. No one W&l touching the alate thia time, Dot even Mr.\nD. In a few minutea, Mr. D. W&l again violently agitated &I with an electric\nahock, which went through him from head to foot, and immediately after-\nwarda we '410, with our own eY8l, each one of ua, the pi8C811 of chalk under\nthe glaaa begin to move alowly, and apparently to walk of their own accord\naero.. the apace of the alate under the tumbler. My husband had Aid just\nbefore that if the piece of red chalk under that tumbler moved, he would\ngive hia head to anyone who wanted it, 10 aure wu he that it could not\npOllibly move. The fint piece of chalk that began to walk abeut WlUI that\nvery red piece I Then the blue and white movedaimultaneoualJw AI though\nDigitized by ~UDis't::\n\fExperimental I n'L'estigation. 429\nuncertain which WI8 the one desired. It WI8 utterly I8tounding to all of us\nto see these pieces of chalk thus walking about under the glaaa with no\nvisible agency to move them! All the while Mr. D., whpse handa were held\non one aide by myself and on the other aide by my husband, seemed to be\non a great nervous strain, with hot handa and great beads of perspiration.\nWhen the chalks stopped moving, we lifted tho) tumbler, and there WI8 a\ncross, partly blue and partly white, and a long red line marking the path\ntaken by the red chalk! We were impressed by this teat beyond the power\nof worda to declare. The test conditions were perfect, and the whole thing\ntook place under our eyes on top of the table with no handa of anybody near\nthe slate. This WI8 the close of the evening's performances.\nUpon reading over my account I see that I have put the lea.ving of the\nroom by Mr. D. in the wrong place. It should have been just before the\nwriting on our slates with coloured chalks instead of just before the\nwriting on the locked slate. But in either case the slates were all the\ntime in full view on the table with the rest of us who remained behind.\nI consider the test conditions to have been perfect throughout, and see\nno possible explanation for the very remarkable phenomena that occurred.\nMRS. - -\nSeptember 14th, 1886.\n2. Report of MISS Y.\nThe exhibition WI8 given in Mr. Hodgson's sitting-room, a medium-sized\nroom with a large square table in the centre, covered with a cloth. Mr.\nHodgson and my father and mother and I were in the room, seated around\nthis table, when Mr. Davey entered. He looked at the table, and said it\nwould not do. So we pushed it aside, and a Pembroke table WI8 brought in\nin its place; I do not know whether it WI8 the property of Mr. Hodgson\nor whether Mr. Davey had brought it with him. It was quite bare, and we\nplaced on it a candle and three single slates which my father had bought at a\nshop on our way to Furnival's Inn. We also had on it a bowl half full of\nwater, containing a sponge to wl8h the slates with, and a cloth with which to\ndry them. On the large table was aIamp and on the mantelpiece were three\ncandles, so the room WI8 quite clearly lighted. We sat in a circle around\nthe table, my mother next to Mr. Davey, then my father, then Mr.\nHodgson, then I by Mr. Davey.\n[a] Mr. Hodgson brought us a little pasteboard box, in which were 8.\nnumber of small pieces of chalk of diff'erent colours. I ohose two of these\nand placed them on ol1e of our sla.tes. We had all previously written either\nour names or our initials on that side of the slate. Mr. Davey slipped the\nslate under the edge of the table, I holding on to it all the time, and we\nheld it flat under the table with our thumbs above the table. I held the slate\nvery firmly against the table, and I am sure I did not relax my hold once.\nAfter waiting some time and I8king various questions, we heard, or seemed\nto hear, the chalk moving on the slate. Wo drew the slate out,tO and on it\nWI8 written\" Yes,\" which was an answer to our laat question.\n[b] We again put the alate under the table, and, in order to be sure that\nnothing had been writtE-n 011 it, I half slipped it out again and saw that it\nWI8 perfectly clean. After some more waiting, my father I8k)lti whoI\\ we\nDigitized by GOogle\n\f430 The Possibilities of Mal-Observation, &c.\nwere to 8ail for America. The chalk again squeaked, and on drawing the\n81ate out we fouud\" the 18th\" written very indistinctly. This happened\nnot to be the date, which was the 15th. I forgot to mention that while we\nwere waiting for the writing we had all joined handa, and talked on indifferent\n,8ubjects. Just before the writing came Mr. Davey grew very quiet and\nwrithed with his arms. His left hand, the one not holding the alate,\npreued very hard upon the table. Meanwhile, my father and mother llBd\nchanged places, becau8e it was indicated in lOme way, by the writing on the\nalate, I think, that we were not all seated in our proper places.\n[c] After these experiments, Mr. Davey seemed very much exhausted.\nButhe drank some water, and insisted on going on to try the experiment with\nthe books. He had previously brought out his own little alate, a double\n-one made of ebony, with a silver lock on it, He said he would use this in\nthe experiment. We saw that it wu clean, and then one of us locked it.\nI think my mother put the key in her pocket. Then we each chose a book\n.at random from a large bookcase at the end of the room, in which the books\nwere arranged apparently without any system. I can't remember whether\nwe left the slate on the table while we chose our books, or whether one of\nus held it.11 When we sat down at the table again, I put my hand on the\n81ate and leaned my elbow on my book. Then Mr. Davey asked us each to\nt!1ink of two numbera under 10, one for a page in our book and one for a\nline on that page. This we did, and sat waiting for some time with our\nlumda joined, but no writing appeared on the slate. Mr. Davey 8eemed\nao exhausted that we determined to give up the experiment, and I put my\nbook back in it. place. We sat as before around the table, diacuBBing the\nfailure of the experiment. Finally Mr. Davey started up and said, \"We\nmust try it with one book alone. Will you choose one, Mias -- Y\n\" I\n.suppoaed that he asked me to do it because my seat was nearest to the\nbookcase. I got up and went to the bookcase. Mr. Davey stood by the\ntable with bis back to me. That latter fact I feel as if I remember mOlt\n.distinctly. I mention it to 8how that I chose my book at random and\nwas not influenced in my choice by him. As I came back to the table he\n.said, \"Do not let me 8ee the name of the book.\" But u I did not undel'\"\n8tand what the trick was to bo, I forgot his injunction and placed the book\non the table at my right lumd. Mr. Davey was on my left. However, I\nonly left it there for a minute or two, and I am 8ure that I either looked at\nit or held it the whole time, 80 that he could not ha\"e opened it without my\nknowledge. Mr. Hodgson brought me lOme 8tring and this I passed around\nthe book 8everal times and tied with four knots. Then my mother sealed\nthe knots and took the book. She did not hold it in her hand the whole\ntime, but either let it lie in her lap or sat on it. But Mr. Davey could not\nhave taken the book or opened it without her knowledge, as he sat perfectly\n8till and we saw everything he did. Wo opened the double 8late, and after\nwe had seen that it wu perfectly clean, I put some chalk in it, locked it, and\nput the key in my pocket; and I also kept hold of the 81ate during the\n.experiment. Mr. Davey uked us each to think of two numbers u before.\nFinally he asked us to write them down on a 8late. I wrote mine on one of\nour own 8late8 so that he could not poB8ibly see what I had written, and I\nplaced it on the table away from Mr. Davey, and leaned my elbow on it.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f;,\nE~ntal Investigation. 431\nI think the others did the same with the other slates. To my remembrancf'l,12\nsome of us watched the locked slate all the time while we were writing.\nAfter a few minutes Mr. Davey asked my mother to change places with\nme. This we did, but I did not relax my hold of the slate until ahe had\nher hand on it. She gave me the book, and I sat on it, and we again joined\nhands. Mr. Davey's right hand waa on the slate which waa on the table,\nand my father held his other hand. Mr. Davey said that the experiment\nwas too difficult while we all thought of different numbers. So he aaked\nmy father to think of his numbers, and the rest of us not to think of oum.\nAfter a little while the chalk inside the slate squeaked a good deal. I took\nthe key out of my pocket, and one of us, my mother, I think, unlocked the\nslate. Both aidea were covered with writing, all of which I will not quote.\nThen we cut the string of the book, having found the seal untouched. We\nopened the book at my father's page and line, 8 and 8, but there waa nothing\nthere that waa quoted on the slate. So we looked at page 3, line 8. There\nwe found this line, ., The greenest grassea Nature laid.\" On the slate was\nthis sentence, \"The greenut grtlIIIU will be laid by N at1Ws.\" It waa not in\nquotation marks, although three of the words were underlined. On my\nmother's page, 8, but not on her line, 4, waa the title of a poem, \"The\nHouse of Clouds.\" This waa on the slate, underlined. On Mr. Hodgson's\npage, 7, but not on his line, 9, waa the title, \"The Deserted Garden.\" This\nwaa also on the slate, underlined. On my page, 1, we found nothing that waa\nquoted on the slate.\n[el] After this experiment, we put aaide Mr. Davey's slate and took two of\nour own. We cleaned them, and placed on one a number of little piecea of\n-coloured chalk. The second slate waa put on the fimt one, and my mother\nand Mr. Davey held it above the table. Mr. Davey asked my father to\nthink of three colours. We joined hands once more, and in a little while we\nheard writing between the slates. When we took one off, on the under one\nwaa written :-\nIn .,.ed, \" We are very glad to be able to give you this.\"\nIn white, \"We can do more yet.\"\nIn green, \"Good-bye.\"\nMy father had thought of red, white, and blue. We could not be sure by\nthe night light whether the \u2022\u2022 good\u00b7bye\" waa written in green or blue. But\nthere was a piece of ch8J.k on the slate that looked much more blue than the\npiece with which the\" good-bye\" was written.\n[s] After this we tried one more experiment. Mr. Davey placed one of our\nslates on two little Japanese salt-cellars, made of china covered with wicker,\nand one common glass salt-cellar. On the slate we put a number of pieces of\ncoloured chalk, and over this a. clean tumbler. Meanwhile Mr. Davey took\nthe candle from our table, and put it on the other one. This made the light\na little leBS distinct, but it waa still very good. Then Mr. Davey asked my\n~ father to draw a figure and write a colour on his double alate. My father\n. I made a star, and wrote\" Red.\" This he ahowed to all of us except Mr.\nDavey, after which he locked it, and put it in his pocket, and gave me the\nkey. We joined hands, and Mr. Davey'a hands did not touch the slate or\nthe glasa at all. We sat for some time, without any results.\nFinally, we gave it up, and my mother and I put onour cloaks to go home\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f432 The Possibilit\u00b7ies of Mal-Observation, &c.\nBut before we left the room, we decided to give it one more trial. We\nthought that perhape we had made too complicated a figure, 10 we unlocked\nthe alate, and rubbed out what my father had written before. Then I dre,..\na Cl'Olll. and he wrote .. Blue.\" We II&t down at the table and watched the\nchalk with the cloaeat Attention. Mr. DAvey's arms shook violently, and once\nwhen the chalk begAn to move, he snatched his hands off the table. But\nmy father and mother did not let go of them. While wo were waiting for the\nchalk to move Mr. DAvey _med very much excited, and he asked my father\nwhAt colour he had written. My father laid .. Blue,\" whereupon my mother\nlaid, .. What a pity you did not lI&y white. It would have been 10 much\neuier to see the white move.\" So my father lAid, ,. Yery well, let it be\nwhite.\" At Mr. DAvey's request, both he and I kept our minds fixed on\nwhite, and on the figure I had made on the alate.\nFinally, the red chalk actually did move acl'Olll the alate. Mr. Dal\"ey\nsnatched the glus off. I expected to see a red Croll, but the red had only\nmade a slight short mark. There was a long white mark, and acl'Olll it. near\nthe top, was a green lnark. But the green mark was very small, and not at\nright angles with the white mark, nor did it extend as far on one side of the\nwhite mark as on the other. 13\nThat is all that happened, as nearly as I can remember. It took place\ntwo evenings ago, the 10th of September. The only curious thinr I noticed\nabout Mr. Davey was the odd way in which his arms, and IOmetinles his\nwhole body, writhed, especially just while the alate-writing was going on.\nAt the time, I was convinced that they were not tricb, alt.hough I had no\nother explanation for them.\nSeptember 12th, 1886.\n3. RepIJrl of MR. Y.\nOn September 10th, 1886, last evening, with my wife and a daughter of\nnineteen yeatS of age, I availed myself of an invitation to see the phenomena\nof slate-writing at the rooms of Mr. Hodgson, No.1, Fumival's Inn,\nLondon.\n. The \"medium\" was introduced as Mr. ClifI'ord [Davey, see p. 410]. a\ngentleman of known social standing who had never accepted any pecuniary\nreturns for his performances.\nMr. Hodgaon's room waa, throughout the conference, lighted by four\ncandles and one shaded lamp, there being no moment of obscuration of light\nthrough the whole evening. The large heavy table in the room was, at Mr.\nDavey's suggestion, substituted by a smaller one with two folding leaves,\nthe table ordinarily in use in Mr. Hodgaon's breakfast-room. The three\nalates were wood bound, about 8 x 10 in. size. ThElY were purchased by me\nat a cost of threepence each, from a stationer in Holbom, on my way to the\nconference. Their surfaces were \"ery rough, requiring much waalling with\na sponge and dry rubbing before they were smooth enough for use.\nMr. Davey had two much larger' slates witlt false black card surfaces,\nshowing how persons were often inlposed on by profOl8ional mediums; 1 but\nI The remark which I believe I made was that the slate with a falae flap\nwas often put forward by professional coniurers as an explanation of the s1&te-\nwriting tricks performed by .. mediumll.\"-S. J. D.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fExperimental Investigation. 433\nof these no use whatever was made. He alBO had a small silver-mounted\nebony framed locked slate. I shall distinguish this by \"D.'s slate,\" and ~he\nones I bought by .. my slates.\" In a card paper box were a number of very\nsmall pieces of pencil of six clliferent colours. The whole apparatus has now\nbeen described.\n[\/I] Mr. Hodgson sat opposite to me, on my left sat my wife opposite to my\ndaughter, between whom and myself Mr. Davey was placed. Apencilwu put\non one of my slates, which wu sustained under the edge of the table by my\ndaughter's fingers at one end and by Mr. Davey's at the other, their thumba\nbeing all the time in sight on the top of the table. The handa of all five of\nthe party were then joined, and BOon we heard a BOund like that of a pencil.\nMy slate was slid out from under the table by my daughter. At the first\nand second examination nothing was on the slate, and it wu washed afresh,\nand soon the word\" yes \" was found scrawled on the upper side of the slate\nas an answer to BOme inclliferent question.\n[b] This was once repeated.\nMy daughter wu sure that her hand had pressed the slate to the lInder\nside of the table during the whole time. It is to be noted that during about a\nminute of the time of waiting Mr. Davey seemed seized with violent nervous\ncontractions of his face, 1U'IDlI, and handa, which appeared to draw largely on\nhiB strength. They wore succeeded by a feverish condition of the surface of\nhiB hand.\n[c] He next requested us to select, each one, a book from Mr. Hodgson's\nlibrary. We did BO, and he proposed to give us the contents of lines, selected\nby page and line by us, in D.'s locked\u00b7slate. But nothing came. He then\nproposed to try it again on a single book, and my daughter, leaving him at\nthe table, replacedl ' on the shelves the book she had first taken down, and\ntook at random a copy of Mrs. Browning's PothM, Second Series. 1880.\nLondon edition.\nHe requested us to mentally choose each one a page and line by nurnhara\nbelow 10.\nI selected page 8, line 8,\nMy wife page 8, line 4,\nMr. Hodgsonl6 page 7, line 9,\nMy daughter page 1 line 9,\nand we each one told aloud1e the page and line selected.\nDuring this time and previous to the announcement of the selection, ..\npencil had been put into D.'s slate, which had lain on the top of the open\ntable throughout. It was then locked, and the key paced in my daughter's\npocket. My wife's hand was then placed upon D.'s slate as it lay on\ntop of the table, and it certainly so remained until, after hearing the\nBOund of writing, my daughter produced the key, and we opened the\nslate.17 My choice had been page 8, line 8, and while the others conversed\nMr. D. bade me fix my mind intently on these figures during a space\nextending probably to 10 minutes. Then my wif\" unlocked D.'s slate, and\nfound the following worda written in legible hand. The italics are aa\nin the original.\n\"How far you remain, oh unbelieving ones, from the goal of your\nendeavours.

On page 3 (which, Mr. D. aid,\nthe power, whatever it wu, might have miataken for 8 u being like it)\nand line 8, we found \" the greeneat grauea Nature,\" worda alao italiciaed on\nthe alate.\nThe other worda, \"1DAicA will prOM,\" in italiCi were not in the pagee of\npoem! indicalllld.

I had been uked to 000018 the coloura\nin which the writing mould be made. I mentally 00018 red, white, and blue,\nbut did not tell my choice. After holding Mr. D.'. band for lOme minutea,\nwith my mind strongly fixed on theae coloun, the alatea were oponed, and\nwe found, in the order I had mentally 181ected :\n(Red) .. We are glad to be able to give you this.\"\n(White) .. We can do more ye'.\"\n(Blue) \"Goodbye.\"\n[e] The Jut performance wu the moving of the pencila on my alate under\na glua. Two Chineae cups were taken from the mantel. On thee the\nalatu reated, with piecea of pencil cut by oU1'l8lvea from the enda of\ncoloured crayons of varioUl colou1\"8, on ita top, under the glua. Upon D.'.\nlock alate, which he could not aee, I wrote \"Blue\" as the colour which\n.hould be uaed, and my daughter made a croll for the figure to be written.\nWe then locked D.'lllate, whioh I placed in my pocket, while my daughter\nput the key into her pocket. WII joined handl as before, but there wu no\nmovement of the pencila. He took the glua off, threw off the penoils, and\nput them back again in a group, near the centre. .Again we joined banda. I\nselected white for the colour, at my daughter'l outspoken luggeatiOn, and\nMr. D. became spasmodically excited, trembling greatly.\nSoon the red pencil began to move in full view of all of 01. It ltopped\nand lOOn began again to move. The distance trav81'l8d was probably an\ninoh. I did not see the other pencil enda move, though they might have\ndone 10.\nUpon removing the glUl we found tracea in white, green, blue, and red,\nbut aoarcely the figure traced by my daughter on D.'.locked alate.18\nHaving in my boyhood practised legerdemain I am able to l8e how a large\nportion of the publicly performed triob are, or could be. done; and sur-\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fE~ntol Investigation. 435\nprising as were the very able performances of Mr. D., I could tell how most\nof them could be donell without anything beyond a probable mind-tl'&llll-\nference of thought intensely concentrated on my part. But I stood in ~he\nse,me relation to the performances which I could not unravel, in which others\nstood to thOBe which I could perform or explain. I cannot therefore make\nmy own discernment the limit of the ,. natural,\" and say that the perform-\nances undiBoovered by me are \"supernatural.\" I am surprised when I find\ntha.t those vened in conjuring, when they reach the limit of their own\ningenuity and knowledge, ascribe to supernatural causes what is beyond their\nken.\nMr. Davey is a gentleman, I believe, incapable of intentional\u00b7 deception.\nHe makes no statement of his performances beyond the fact that they are\nphenomena to be accurately observei. They exceed in their apparent\nsupematuraIiam the displays usually made by paid mediums. I believe that;\na full explanation of his methods would \"fire a shot heard round the\nworld\" in almost every civilised community where the phenomena of so-\ncalled \"Spiritualism\" are perplexing, and often madden, true and good\npeople.\nWhatever may be the real psychical phenomena which lie behind or\nalongside of the supposed revelation from spirits, they should be separated\nfrom the often proved deceptions of paid mediWDB. And I can conceive of\nno more efl'ectual step towards this than for some one who excels these\nmagicians upon their own chosen field, to frankly tell the world how it\nis all done. Scientists then would have the ground cleared for accurate\ninvestigation, and, more important still, millions might be saved from the\ndelusions of deceitful \" mediums.\" For the atrocious wickedneBB of deceit-\nfully trespaBBing by ffaud upon the most holy of all human relationahips, the\nsacred regard for the dead, it is difficult to find strong enough terms to\nexpress our contemptuous reprobation.\nSITTING III.\nThe sitting described by Mr. Legge in the following letter took\nplace on the same evening as the one described in the foregoing\nthree reports, September 10th, 1886.\nMy DBA-It HODGSON,-\nReport of Mlr.. LBoaB.\n12, Mitre Court Ohambers,\nTemple, E.O.\n12th September, 1886.\nI said I would let you have a straightforward account of what I\nBBW in your chambers on Friday evening; here it is, written while my\nrecollections are distinct. I had been sitting with Hughes, who told me\nyou had a seance on. We were talking on various subjects, and never\ntouched that of the seance going on in the next room, so that in fact 1\nsoon forgot all about it. Presently however the door oDen...r, and~\nDlgMed by~OO(5''-\n2 F 2\n\f436 The Possibilities of Mal-Observation, &c.\ncame in with Mr. --, whom I had never seen before, and behind him were\nhis wife and daughter. A little embarra.aaed by sudden introductions, I\npaued out into the entry to your roo018, and there saw for the first time\nClifford (the name, is it not 1) [Davey, see p. 410]. In a few minutes the\n___ leU, and I went into the room where the seance had been. There I\nwas introduced to Davey, who suggested, after some talk on what had\ngone before, that I might like to see something.\n[d] I jumped at the proposal, and as a preliminary took Davey's locked\nalate, opened it, and cleaned it (or rather cleaned it again, for it was clean\nalready), then, having slipped in a bitof pencil, locked it, and put the key in\nmy pocket, keeping the slate also in my hand or under my arm all the time\nafterwards. 1\n[tI] Next I chose one of your slates, cleaned it, and, at Davey's\nrequest, having put a fragment of pencil upon it, slippedll it under the table,\n80 as just to cover it with the slab, the pencil of course being on the upper\nIUrface. The table was a plain deal one, and I satisfied myself that there\nwere no projections on the under-surface which could leave a mark. We then\nformed contact, Davey's right hand being partly on my left and partly on\nthe slate, i.e., where his hand overlapped mine which held the slate pl'888ed\nagainst the table. The faint lOund of writing WIlolJ distinctly audible, and\nwhen it ceased I drew the slate out. There were merely indistinct scrawla\nupon it.\n[b] But it appeared that I ought to have asked a question to myself,\nand 80 extracted an answer from the slate. So after I had cleaned the slate\nI thought of a question. I acted preciaely as before.8 The sound of writing\nwas again heard, and the slate, when I drew it out, bore clearly and\ndistinctly written tlte word\" yes \"-the ftnalletter of which was done in\nparticularly admirable style. The question' had reference to lOme doubtful\nincrease in my official salary, and I am bound to say I was as much delighted\nas astounded by the mysterioUII writing.\n[c] The next experiment was the placing of 3 bits of coloured chalk\non the table, and of a clean llate (selected and placed by myself)S over\nthem. I put my hand on the slate, Davey his on mine, and we joined\ncontact. Again we heard the sound of writing, and when I lifted the\nslate there was written large and neatly in the coloured chalks (three lines\nor so in each colour) this mesaage :-\"Don't you think I've done enough\nfor you to-night I'm tired Joey.\" I noticed the chalka seemed worn,\nshowing signa of work, just like the little bit of pencil in the previous\nexperiment.\n[ttl After this Davey asked me to write a question in chalk on one of your\nslates. While I was writing it he asked for a drink of water, and you\npointed to a comer of the room where there was some. He went there and\nwhen he came back seemed to have forgotten his request for he now asked\nme for the locked slate, which I had latterly put in my pocket.G I brought it\nout, placed it on the table, set my hand on it, Davey his on mine, and\njoined contact just as before with Hughes and yourself, Hughes holding my\nright and your left, you Davey'S left. Then we heard the same writing\nsound, very faint this time, and after a considerable interval I was told to\ntake up the llate and unlock it. Taking the key out of mYrPOCket fdid 10,\nDigitized by ~008 e\n\fExperi'TMntal Investigation. 437\nand BaW written on both leaves a long message, precisely as I give it :-\" H\nyou don't believe in spirit power after\"this you are not worth the attention\nof any honest medum (Bic) Joey.\" Mter this, Davey, who seemed\npretty tired, had to rush off to catch a train. I should add that the room\nhad been in full lampT light all the time, the lamp being placed on a side\ntable thus throwing a certain light under as well as over the table we were\nsitting at. Also that the contact was not continuously perfect, for I\nremember that Hughes and yourself occasionally left one hand free for a\nshort time, and lastJy that there was no enforced silence.\nThe above are the facts as detailed as I can give them; I offer no com\u00b7\nment on them for indeed I can't. Though I had heard of such experiments\nbefore, personal experience was entirely new to me, and has left me in\nimmense perplexity.\nIf you see Davey, please thank him for his kindnesa in troubImg after\nan already long sitting to give me some specimens of his \"craft,\" or whatever\nname one can give 10 nameleBB a faculty. I am also sincerely obliged to\nHughes and yourself.-Yours,\nJ. G. !.Eoo\u2022\u2022\nSITTING IV.\nThe next three reports are by Mr. Padshah, and Mr. and Mrs.\nRussell. Mr. Padshah had had some previous experience with a well\u00b7\nknown medium, but had not been convinced that the phenomena which\nhe had witnessed in the medium's presence were not the result of\ntrickery. His account of his seance with me shows that he was in some\nrespects a careful observer, and that he was still more careful in record\u00b7\ning his remembrances. He was not informed until after he had written\nhis report, that the phenomena were due to conjuring. Mr. and Mrs.\nRussell, however, knew before the sitting that they were about to\nwitness conjuring performances. They came on an unexpected visit to\nMr. Hodgson, and on learning that I was a.bout to give a sitting,\nrequested permission to be present. I was perfectly conscious of the\nfact that they were both using their best endeavours to discover my\nexact modus operandi. And although Mr. Russell failed to detect any\nof my writing processes, he correctly observed and remembered some of\nmy manipulations with slates a.bove the table, which, it will be seen,\nentirely escaped the observation or remembrance of Mr. Padshah.\n1. Report of MR. PADSHAH.\n1, Furnival's Inn, London.\nSept. 15, 1886.\nThis evening in Hodgson's room we had a ~ance with Mr. Davey; Mr.\nand Mrs. Russell, Mr. F. S. Hughes, Hodgson and myself being the\nparty. Before sitting I had lOme interesting conversation with Mr. D. about\nthe results usually got by him and lOme which I had with Eglin1pv.. Mrl D.\n. Digitized by ~008 e\n\f4038 7'he P088ibilities of Mal-Observation, t\/;c.\nin COUI'IIe of the oonvenation told me he waa very anxioWl that hilreaw....\nabould be tried and watched like- thOle of any profe.ioDAl medium, and\nindeed, his subeequent proceedinga were very ~bly contrasted with\nthose witneued at the profeaaioDAl.eancea. There WlI8 every apparent\ndesire to get the oonditions named by members of the party, and to\nsee that results were obtained under those conditions. I had suggested in our\npreliminary conversation how important it might be to get my own name-\nnot surname-which no one oxcept myself in the room knew. The alatea on\nwhich we desired the writings were three of them Hodgson'., three I\nhad bought this evening at Lilley'., Cambridge, and oue Mr. D.'s own double\nalate. I regret that desiring to add some frienda to the party, I had left the\nrooma to call upon thOle friends, and during that interval, Hodgson and\nMr. Hughes being busy, we nec8lllllU'ily could not keep the alates in our eye\nfor a abort interval during which Mr. D. was in the room.\nWeU, we commenced, I aitting all the time next to Mr. D., except on08,\nwhen Mrs. RuueU and I interchanged plaoea, with no advantage; and so we\nresumed the original order.\n[f] There was full light on every corner of the table ; two of my (1) ala--.\none washed by myself, the other by Mr. D., were put very nearly in the\ncentre with a number of small chalk-pieces between them of difl'erent ooloura\n- (five in all, I find now on inquiry from Hodgson-red, blue, green,\nyeUow, white-but which I was not sure of, then, not having noticed\nthem).\n[a] Under the table with the frame projecting on Mr. D.'s aide, waa a\naingle slate, also mine, I believe, and w&abed by I do not know whom, Mr.\nD. supporting it on his aide by the four fingers underneath, and the\nthumb over the table in sight of all; his left hand joining with that of Mr.\nRuuell'B right, Mr. R.'B left with Mr. Hughes' right,\u00b7 Mr. Hughes' with Mr.\nRuueU's, and Mrs. RuueU's left with my right, all resting either on the\ntable, or otherwise alwaYB in Bight; and my left supporting also the alate just\nthe sarue as Mr. D. Between the alate and the table were put suoceaaively\nchalks and a small pencil, the chalka being cruahed, and therefore\ngiven up.\n[j] Mr. D. and Mr. Ruaaell often put their handa on the pair of single\nalates.\n[g] Mr. D.'s double alate, not waahed,a I believe, that I can remember,\nbut locked up by myself carefuUy, with the key always in my pocket or on\nmy RIGHT hand near Mrs. Ruuell, never out of my view, wu in my charge,\ngenerally being behind my back.\n[a] For lome time there _med to be no result, Mr. D. telling us that he\nfelt no .,go\" in the thing,and asking me if it was not due to my undue aceptic-\nism. Of course I UBured him that my failing was rather in the reverse direc-\ntion. The conversation was generally on Spiritualisticsubjects, being m08tly a\ngood-humoured diacuaaion of the experienC81 of some Spiritualists. On Mr.\nD.'luking me to select a particular colour of chalk ~ write between the two\nalates,4 I suggested white ; but we never got it.\n[b] He then wished me to fix my mind on a particular number. I\nselected five (5), and drew an image of it before my mental eye. The\nnumber we got was, however, 6; and I must eay, that but for the horimntaJ.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fEzpenmental Investigation. 439\nstroke, I myself would be unable to distinguish often between my 5's and\n6's. Mr. D. then uked if there were going to be any manifestatioDB-the\n&D8weri W&8 legibly \" Yes.\"\n[j] Then we' &8ked for a writing on one of the pair of alates, of mixed\ncolours, mine being blue, and Mrs. RU88ell's selection red. &metimu I\nthink we all put our handa on the pair of slaa and then both Mr. D.'s\nhanda were in full view, and there could be no mistake of what they were\ndoing,-viz., that they were shaking sometimes with great force, at the\naame time that his teeth were chattering.\n[d, e] However, before any writing came there &8 aaked for, we had first a\nmeBB&ge on the single alate \"Wait,\" and at another time, I noticed (without\nany clear sound of writing &8 W&8 unmiatakeable during the two previous\ncaaea}-and I believe nobody had observed it before I drew their notice-a.\nID8811&g8 on one aide of the slate, \"Try the (1) chalks.\"\n[j] Well, now we all concentrated our attention on the pair of slates\nvery nearly in the centre; and I thought, &8 requested, of two numbers,\n6,7; Mr. D. very shortly after a deal of shaking of his handa, at length said\nthat we might see the alates. There, to my surprise, I beheld a meBB&g8\nforsooth, in two coloured pencils, -blue and red, which I copy below.\n(Blue Pencil) : \\\n\" Weare very pleaaed to be able to give you this writing under these\nconditioDB, which must or ought at leaat to the ordinary mind do away\nwith the p088ibility of it being produced by ordinary me&D8.\n(Red Pencil):\n\"If you will be kind enough to wait patiently you may rest &88ured we\nwill do our beat to do more for you.\n\" EAB.NEST. \"\n[c] I forgot to 88y that before this writing appeared, on the large alate,\ninatead of the numbers we wanted, we got written' \"Boorzu.\" Now this\n&8 it happens is the original Persian, the modem corruption of which is my\ninitial name. This would be extraordinary except that it might have\nhappened by accident, and also I had not time enough .to see the l&8t \"u\"\nbefore the word W&8 wiped off by Mr. D.\n(g] Then we tried to get some results with books, but &8 it appeared to\nme Mr. D. had read almost every book in Hodgaon'slibrary, it W&8 not euy\nto select one to preclude the hypothesis of t;hought-tranaference. So we\nattempted to get numbersagain, and I concentrated my attention on theaame\nwo previous numbers(5, 7); we soon got the 7 on the single alate, but inatead\nof the 5, we got \"Think Book.\" Mr. D. desired me to think of one; my\nmind wu unsettJed between The Brain aI a\" Organ of Mind, by Baabiaa,\nand International Law, so to avoid any interfereDce with the conditions,\nI pitched upon the periodical, Mind. Mr. and Mrs. RU8l8ll having left us,\nwe all concentrated our attention on the double closed slate, which, on\nopening at frequent intervals, we had found unwritten.\u00b7 The key W&8 now\nin my pocket, that is certain, for on seeking to open it, I found it entangled\nwith the coppers in my waistcoat pocket. The double slate W&8 also un-\ndoubtedly locked, for I carefully locked it myself. I mentallj',. &8 bef9r8,\nDigitized by ~0081e\n\f440 The P088ibilitiu of Mal-Observation, etc.\nconcentrated my attention on getting the word .. Mind\" written within.\nAfter IIOme time HodgllOn aaid he heard the lIOund of writing, and on opening\nit we found the alate full. The following is the text :-\n.. This phenomenon is not Spiritualistic, nor is it the projection into\nobjectivity through the higher facultiee unfolded by the abnormal issues of\nhuman developruenta-'Mediumahip'1 Yee. But mediumahip of WHAT 7 Do\nyou think you could appreciate if we were to tell you 1 Ah no!

The Brain AN organ of Mind, ha I we laugh.\"\nThis completea the text. I opened the alate myaelf, and I found IIOme\nICratchee made by the pencil over the writing. AlIlO the facet aeemed to\nhave worn out a little by writing. After this we made IIOme fruitleaa efrortll\nat getting IIOmething, but we could not, and in a very Ihort time we adjourned.\nAI the table round which we aat waa removed, HodgllOn pointed out that it\nW81 beyond IUlpicioD,-a fact which I had omitted to DOtice.\n[f] How came, now, the writing between the pair of alatea, and in the\ncloaed double slate 1 About the former, it is certain that the alate on which\nthe writing came waa one of the throe I had purchased that evening at Cam\u00b7\nbridge; 81 W81 atteated by ita Bize correaponding with the two othera marked,\nand alIIO by the shape of the framea, and the cracka8 in them noticed by\nHodgllOn. I confeBS I do not remember even after luch a brief lapae of time,\nwhether I had examined' the two slatea not washed by me, and found them\nunwritten. I imagine I must have, for otherwiae it would be very Itupid ;\nand, beaidel, if there had been any writing it. would not have eacaped the\nnotice of Mr. RUBBell, who aeerued to be particularly careful. Besides, we\nconatantly looked to lee if there W81 any writing there. Of courae, a con\u00b7\njurer of ordinary pretensiona could deceive on the laat point. There might\nbe writing on the bottom IUrface of the lower alate, while we could obaerve\nonly the three upper IUrfacee, if 110 many. Before we aaw the writing there,\nMr. D. gave a pUSh,10 and though I am almoat lure that it W81 I who removed\nthe upper alate, and found the writing there, I am afraid I cannot be certain.\nIndeed, I doubt if I can with any confidence &l88rt whether the writing waa\non the lower surface of the upper Ilate, or the upper IUrface of the lower\nalate, even if I waa certain that it waa not on the loweat face. When I reo\nmember that Mr. D. il deliberately anxioul to be tried by DO other than a\nconjurer's ltandard, and alao that I have omitted to notice things 110 elemen.\ntary, and yet 110 eBBent.ial, even IIOme of them actually luggeated for my\nobaervation by Mr. D., I regret I did Dot aak IIOrue one elae of the party to\nobserve and act. For it is evident that if I did not lee the llatea clean on all\nthe lurfacea before commencement, my teltimony becomel absolutely value-\nleBS. But now IUPpose that we have aatiafactioD on theae head&, atill\nit may be conaidered poBBible that the writing may be precipitated\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fExperinnental I nvesti1\/ation. 441\nby chemical means. Whether, if the writing disappears under the\ninfluence of water, the chemical theory may still hold, of course I can-\nnot say. But if BO, it is curious that Mr. D. could pr.uh the slates at a par-\nticular moment; and before that none of us could notice, in that full light,\nany formation of letters, or gradual precipitation, that I can see. Besides,\nMr. D. could barely have had time enough to tamper with the slates. He\ntold me himself that he had observed them lying. He had almost 40\nminutes to himself, with little intervals, when Hodgson would come in. He\nmight during that interval have written out all the first meuage, without\nusing a chemical; in that caBe we &l\"e all guilty of grOBB negligence which it\nis ridiculous to credit my colleaguesll with. But he might have also used a\nchemical; only he could not have foreseen the opportunity of my going out ;\nand as everyone is supposed to bring his own slates, why he should carry\nabout chemicalB with him it is difficult to see. In this connection I may also\nobserve that Mr. D. remarked to me during our conversation after tea, how\ngreat the temptation is for the occultist to be fraudulent; when pecuniary\nremuneration is not the object, .. the good of the cause\" is supposed to\njustify them, and it may not be unjust to add,-the desire to make people\ntalk about them is not altogether a factor without influence. Just imagine\nthe temptation in Vanity Fair of an * * ,the guest of princes and em-\nperors, and having the great honour of a recommendation from the first of\nliving Englishmen-Mr. * * I But it is only fair to Mr. D. to say that\nhe holds this justification, he say., in great abomination. As for the selection\nof colours being blue and red, and turning out BO, it seems to me quite\nnatural, and it may not be without significance that the white writing with\nchalk we asked for never came. Besides, there is nothing in the matter itself\nwhich may not have been written beforehand, indeed it was not what we had\nwanted. Now, though I point out my own defects of observation, it is only\nto show how little really my testimony is worth except for points of confirma-\ntion; and I hope I shall be able to remedy them next time.\n[g] Somewhat different is the caBe of the double closed slate. I do not\nremember it to have been washed; but there never was any writing on it\nexcept a scratch occasionally, whenever I opened it, with the exception of the\nlast time. As I opened it myself I think I could easily have observed any\ngradual. precipitations. The reference to \" Brain as an organ of Mind .. is not\naltogether without significance. It is also evident that Mr. D. must have\nminutely studied the time it takes for complete precipitation; or that the\nwhole precipitation takes place simultaneously; or that the phenomenon\nis undoubtedly genuine. The theory of mere writing without a chemical\nand then bamboozling me would be really contemptible.II\n[c] The reading of numbers was not a failure j but it was not convincing.\n\"Boorzu,\" however, was remarkable.\nOn.the whole, I myself strongly incline more towards the genuinene88 of\nthe phenomena than the reverse j but I cannot disguise it from myself that\nthat is largely due to a previous impreuion gathered from Mr. D. '. results\nwith others which were read out to me. If I get the same things next time\nwith my oum double-slate, and a pair of .lates that have never left my\nsight, I think I should be justified in being convinced of BOmething\nabnormal.I.

After\nlOme minutea Mr. D. brought up the alate, but there was nothing on it.\n(f] He then put lOme lmall piecel of chalk on one of the other alate.\nlying on the table, covered it with another alate, and laid he would try to get\nlOme writing there if we would choose the colours we would like it in. Mr.\nP. chose blue and my wife <at my auggestion) red.\n[a] Mr. D. then replaced the single IIlate under the comer of the table.\nholding it &I before, but again several minutes puaed without any result.\nHe then uked my wife to change placea with Mr. P., which ahe did, holding\nthe alate with her left hand &I he had done. But again, after several minute&,\nthere W&l no writing.\n[b] Then my wife and Mr. P. took their old plaoea, Mr. D. once more\nput the alate under the comer &I before, and uked Mr. P. to think of\nlOme number under 10, 88.ying that he would try to get it written for him.\nHe then laid aloud: \"Please 88.y whether we Ihall get anything to-uigh~\"\nBOOn after which Mr. P. declared he hew the lOund of writing; whereupon\nthe alate W&l brought up, and the word \"yel\" and the number .. 6\" were\nfound upon it.16 Mr. P. 88.id he had thought of 5, but explained that he made\nhiB fivel in luch a CUriOUI way that they nlight euily be mistaken for sixea.\n[e] Mr. D. now 88.id that a ltart having been made, more IUCOOlll might be\nlooked for, 10 the experiment was repeated, the alate being brought up at in-\ntervala of from 5 to 10 minutes. The first time it had the letters BOORZ 16\nupon it, which Mr. P. explained were the first five letters of his Chriatian\nname which W&l in Persian written BOORZU. Neither Mr. Hodgson, Mr.\nHughea, my wife, nor myself had ever hea.nl of this name before, but I did\nnot quite understand whether Mr. D. had or had Dot heard it from Mr. P.\nbefore the sitting began.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fExperimental Inve8tigation. 443\n[a, e] Next time there was the single word \" Wait,\" and a little later the\nwords \"Try Chalka.\" We accordingly concentrated our attention on the two\n_tes with the chalka between them, which had been left lying on the table.\n[f] Mr. Davey and Mr. P. each placed a hand on them, and we completed\nthe cirele. From time to time Mr. D. opened the slates, but for a long\ntime there was no result.\n[g] Presently he got up and went to the bookcase, saying he would try\nto read BOmething from a book. He asked Mr. P. to go and choose one.\nMr. P. did 80 (taking the locked slate with him), and suggested several\nbooks, to all of which Mr. D. objected on various grounda. Finally, how-\never, a volume of Swinburne's poems was selected and placed on the table,\nMr. D. saying he would try to get a reference in the locked alate to any\nparticular page and line below 10 Mr. P. might choose. But though the\nalate was opened two or three times, no writing was found on it.\n[j] In the meantime, Mr. D. had once more examined the two slates\nwhere the coloured chalka were, but finding nothing, had placed them\naide by side, and careleBBly, as if in a fit of abaent-mindedneBB, had taken the\nchalks from the slate which had been at the bottom, and placed them on the\nother. He had then put them together as before, except that the original\nposition of the slatea was reversed, the old bottom one being now at the top,\nand the old top one at the bottom. Presently, asking Mr. P. if in a former\nsitting with Eglinton the medium had not got IOlDe writing on his shoulder,\nhe took up the two slates and placed them on Mr. P.'a shoulder, but in 1_\nthan a minute took them off, reversing17 them as he did so, and replaced them\non the table. The old bottom slate was now once more at the bottom, and\nthe old top one at the top, but each slate had been reversed, BO that the two\nsides which had originally been turned to the table were now turned up.\nIn a few minutes, Mr. D. had a IOrt of convulsion, Mr. Hodgson and Mr.\nHughes said they heard sounds like writing, the slatea were opened, and\nthere, on the lower one, was a meBBage, half in green,18 half in red (nearly\nthe colours chosen by Mr. P. and my wife), expreaaing a hope that we should\nbe satisfied with writing given thus, under such excellent test conditions.\nMr. P. remarked that he had asked for blue, and that the colour given was\ngreen; and then, on being asked, said he could not see how Mr. D. could\nhave produced this writing by ordinary physical meanB, and then my wife\nand I left.\nI am writing this account without notes,19 on the moming of Friday,\nSeptember 17th.

RUSSELL.\n[16, Somerfield Road, FinBbury Park, N.]\nI was present with my husband at a a6ance given by Mr. Davey to Mr.\nPadahahat Mr. Hodgson'a rooms in Furnival's Inn, on Wednesday night, the\n15th inBt.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f444 The POBSibilities of Mal-Observat\u00b7ion, clcc.\nThere were IIix of us preeent. We aat round a IIDlIIll deal table, which bad\na drawer at eachlO end. The one my end W88 empty. I did not examine the\nother. Two lampa were in the room, and four candles, one of which wall on\nthe table. Mr. Padahah aat next to Mr. Davey and I next to Mr. Padahah.\n[g] He began by cleaning the in,ide of a locked Blate given him by Mr.\nDavey, who having chOlen and put iMide a ,mall piece of chalk, delired Mr.\nPadlhah to lock the Blate and keep it in hiB poueuion. Mr. Padahab\nlocked it and put it behind him in the chair he W88 Bitting in, and the key in\nbiB pocket.\n[a] )Ir. Davey then took a IIDlIIll ordinary Blate, and a ,mall piece of IIlate\npencil with no pointl, 88king Mr. Padahah to fint clean the Blate him-\nlelf on both ,idel. ThiB being done they both held the Blate under the edge\nof the table with the fingen on the Blate and the thumb. on the edge of the\ntable. We then all joined handl, and aat talking for lOme time. Once or\ntwice Mr. Davey took out the Blate to examine, but found DO writing. Be\nthen 88ked me to change place, with Mr. Padlhah, and hold the Blate, which\nI did. Once or twice he took out the Blate whillt I W88 holding it, and once\nthere W88 a zigzag pencil mark on it which W88 not there before, but no\nwriting.\n[b] Mr. Pad,hah then took the ,late again. We ,till went Oil waiting,\nand taking out the Blate to look at. Twice, lOme white chalk that Mr.\nPadlhah had chOlen W88 cNlhed when we looked at it. Mr. Davey then\nbent biB head clOle to the table and uked in a loud voice, .. Tell us if we\n,ball have any manifestation, to-night or no; only one word Yes or No.\"\nAfter waiting again Mr. Padshah said he heard the lOund of writing. On\nlooking, \u2022\u2022 Ye, \" W88 found written on the Blate. The letten were very uneven\nand acrawling. Mr. Davey then asked Mr. Padahah to think of a number,\nand a figure 6 wu given instead of a 6 which he had thought of. But Mr.\nPad8hah explained it by aaying that he usually made thOle figures very much\nalike, and it would be ouy to confuae them.\n[d, e) After waiting again the single word .. Wait\" W88 found, and a\nlittle time afterwards \"Try chalks\" in the lame bad writing (10 bad that\nwe turned it fint one way and then another to make it out) with a very\nimperfect figure 8 that Mr. Padahah had been thinking of. Mr. Padahah\nbimlelf diacovered tbiB laat just 88 Mr. Davey W88 putting back the alate\nunder the table.\n[g) Nothing wu yet found in the locked alate.\n[j) Mr. Davey then put in leveral pieoo, of ooloured chalks between\ntwo BlateB which had been lying on the table all the time, with one piece of\npencil inside, and he and my hu,band placed their handl on it.\n[c) On again taking up the Blate under the table, a curious word\nappeared written on it which we could DOt read, written in much better\nchar&eten, but which appeared to me to be a foreign word. On Mr.\nPadlhah'B looking at it, he exclaimed ..Why it iB my own name Boorzu,\nwhich I am hardly ever called by I\" No one at the table knew it W88 Mr.\nPadahah'B name, Mr. Davey being pOIitive that he had never heard it\nbefore, and indeed neither of us had. Mr. Padahah then reminded Mr.\nDavey that he had 88ked him to 88k biB name before tea, which Mr. Davey\nsaid he had forgotten.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fE:tperi;mental Investigation. 445\n[g] Nothing having been written between the two Blates, Mr. Davey then\nsaked Mr. Padahah to go to the bookcaae and choose a book. He brought\none and put it on the table, but Mr. Davey objected that it waB too big. I\nthink it W&8 a book of Spencer'B. Mr. Davey then went to the bookcaae with\nMr. PadBhah and helped him to choose a book, llaying it must be aamall one.\nand in large print, that a good clear, large print W&8 of the most importance.\nMr. Padahah, on going to the bookcaae, took the locked alate with him.\nThey brought back a volume of Swinburne's poems, !'tlr. Davey opening it\nhere and there, and obBerving that the wont of it W&8 he knew that particular\nbook very well. Mr. Padahah then thought of a page under 10, but no\nwriting W&8 given. I then went to the bookcaae for a book, and brought back\nAurora Leigh, which, on Mr. Davey's seeing, he laid it W&8 the same &8 they\nhad had two or three nights before, and it would not do.\n[J] He then decided to give up the book test altogether, and con-\ncentrated all his attention on the two slates on the table. He &8ked Mr.\nPadahah and myself to choose a colour that we would have the writing in.\nMr. Padahah chose blue, and III red. There were 3 or 4, di1ferent small\npieces of coloured chalkallll in the slates. Mr. Padahah and myself then\nheld our handa over the BlateB with Mr. Davey and my hUBband. Mr.\nDavey became very intense, llaying we mu. get BOme manifeBtations that\nnight. Mr. Padshah said that perhaps they would not write on the table\nbetween the alateB, that although they had said .. try chalks,\" they did not\nsay on which slate. We waited BOme time without any result. Once Mr.\nDavey put the a1atea on Mr. Padahah'B shoulder, asking if Mr. Eglinton\nhad not tried him in that way. He replaced them after a few seconda on the\ntable, and turned them over to look inside, but nothing W&8 found. At laat\nMr. Davey became more intense, and after a kind of convulsive shaking, he\nturned open the slates once more, and, with BOme excitement, Bhowed us one\nwhole Bide covered with even good writing, half in green and half in red. I\ncannot remember what it was exactly, not having taken a copy. But the\ngreen 11'&8 BOmething about giving us a good manifestation that night, and\nthe red about waiting patiently. ThiB laat being in my colour, struck me\nsa a ourious coincidence, &8 I had been the most impatient all the evening.\nThen Mr. Padahah again unlocked the locked slate, but found nothing, and\nafter our waiting BOme time longer, Mr. Davey suggested we might perhaps\nbe too many, as he had seldom had Buoh bad results in so long a Bitting. AB\nmy husband and I wished to get home, we then left, it being past 10 o'clock,\nand we began BOOn after eight. Mr. Davey proposed going on with the\naitting after we had left, with what results I do not know.\nI am writing thiB account from memory, without notes, on Friday\nevening, September 17th.\nBBS8IB RUSSELL.\nSITTING V.\nPrevious to my sitting with Mr. Block he had been informed that\nmy \"phenomena.\" were not due to the agency of \"spirits,\" and he\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f446 The P088'ibilitia of MaJ-Ob8enJatUm, &:c.\nW&8 exceedingly sceptical &8 to the occurrence of any phenomena at\nall under Buch conditions &8 had been described to him.\nReport of MK.

He, a youth of 16, perfectly ignorant of the whole aubject of\nSpiritualiam, mediums, or psychical science, with eyea quick to diacern every\nmovement of hand or body ; 1, calmly observing what I .'6 withou' desiring\nto theoriae or account for the BIUIle, or the way in which it w.. aoeompliahed.\nHaving heard of what you were doing I wu curiona to witneu myaelf\nyour performances, and you kindly gratified me by giving me what I auppose\nyou would call a ance. To my own disappointment, and I fear to your 01l'D\ninconvenience and perhaps greater atrain of mind in consequence, I had but\nhalf-an-hour with you, having to catch my laat train home.\nYou, my .on, and I having adjourned to the library, eat down at a emall\nordinary table with folding flaps, when you produced leveral alates and alllll&ll\nfolding alate with hingea and pstent lock. Giving me the latter you &liked\nme to thoroughly lponge and wipe it, and placing a very lmall piece of pencil\nbetween the two llatel, I locked them and gave the key to my IOD, aDd\nplaced the alate in my right hand pocket, being the aide away from you.\n[\u00ab]You then handed me an ordinary alate which you requeated me alao to\nwelliponge and wipe and put a mark in the comer of each aido, which I did.\nThen, putting a amall piece of pencil in the middle of the alate you placed\nit-or alid it-under the comer of the extended flap of the table, placing\nthe fingen of your right hand under it, and your thumb 011 the upper aide\nof the table, and your left hand on the table; I placing the fingen of\nmy left hand next and touching youn under the alate, and thumb on\nthe table, and with my right hand holding the left hand of my IOn. In\na few seconds you Aid, .. Will you uk a qU8ltion 1\" when I &liked,\n.. What ahall I be doing this time to-morrow night 1\" In about 3 or\n4 minutes a alight ICratching wu to be heard, and you slid the alate from\nunder the table, and only a mark of an illegible word wu to be seen.\n[b] The alate was again Iponged and wiped by me, and ~n replaced by\nyou in the Bame poaition &I before-when you, either .. part of the per-\nformance or in fun, evinced lOme impatience and demanded an IDIwer to my\nquestion, and in a few minutea acratching w.. again heard, and on with-\ndrawing the alate from under the table, the word \"Reading\" very legibly\nwritten. was on the alate.\n[c] You then took two alatea which you handed to me to sponge and wipe\n.. before, which I did, and placing 3 or 4 small pieces of coloured chalk, which\nyou placed between the 2 alatea, which were placed on the t.op of the table,\nyou asked my BOn to take a book from the bookC&l8, to think of a page\nwithout letting you know either the book or the page thought of, and keep\nthe book in hiB poBI8BIIion. Then asking him in what coloured chalk the\nwriting should appear-he desired it Ihould be in red-you placed both\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f447\nyour hands firmly on the upper slate; I placed both mine, and my BOn did\nthe same, all of us preaaing on the slates firmly.\nWaiting a few minutes, you again manifested impatience and excitement\nat the little delay, when we Boon after distinctly heard a IICl'&tching between\nthe slates, which when looked at, the upper alate W&8 found covered with\nwriting, in red chalk &8 desired. The writing W&8 apparently an extract of\nsome kind, but unfortunately the opportunity of testing ita accuracy W&8 lost\nas my BOn omitted to think of a page.\n[d) Although the time at our disposal W&8 but a few minutes--a quarter\nof an hour at most- you kindly performed another trick, which W&8 writing\nbetween the locked slates. As I have said, theSe were handed to me by you at\nthe commencement of our Bitting, were sponged and wiped by me, a piece of\npencil placed between the two slates-locked by me, and key handed by me\nto my BOn and the slates placed in my pocket, BO that it W&8 manifest you\nnever had any touoh or handling of these locked-up slates. Asking me to\nunlook them I did BO and found them in the same condition &8 when I placed\nthem in my pocket. I, however, again wiped them with the sponge-you\nreplaced the amall piece of pencil, I locked them together again, handing the\nkey to my BOn, and handing you the slates thus locked. TheBe you placed\non the top comer of the table, placing both your hands upon them-I and my\nson doing the same. In about 3 minutes, at moat, you began to preas\nenergetically upon the slates, when we heard very distinctly a alight\nscratching between them. You called my attention to the BOund, lifting your\nhands, called my observation to the fact that when you did BO the BOund\nstopped,-being again audible when you replaced your hands. In a few\nseconds taking away your hands, you &8ked me to unlock the slates, which I\ndid and there saw writing in a good fiowing hand-not in your style I\nobserved, on the whole of the upper, and on part of the lower slate. I read\nthe first few lineB, whioh were that it was hoped I had enjoyed the\nentertainment.\nI much regret my hurried departure.\nIn the above memorandum, I have repested I believe faithfully what\nI saw. Yours faithfully,\nALFRED S. BLOOL\nAfter receiving Mr. Block'B report I asked him the following\nqueBtionB :-\n1. Kindly say on which Bide the writing appesred when the slate W&8\nheld against the table, viz., W&8 it on the lower side where my fingers were\nor upon the upper Bide nearest the table; also when you grasped the slate\nwith me against the table do you remember if you held it firmly or not 7\n2. Did I endeavour to distract your attention from the slates 7\n3. To the best of your belief were the slates devoid of writing when you\nexamined and marked them, and did either Alfred or yourself observe the\nslightest opportunity for my writing on them by ordinary natural means 7\nMr. Block replied on November 6th, 1886, as follows :-\n1. The writing W&8 on the Bide of the Blate nearest the table, and &8 you\nheld the alate and I also held it very tightly against the under side of the\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f448 The Possibilities of Mal-Observation, J:c.\ntable flap, it appeared to me to be impouible for you to have touched the\npencil or that side of the slate on which the writing appeared.\n2. You certainly did not appear to endeavour to distract my attention\nfrom the slate-quite the contrary.\n3. To the best of my belief and as far as the evidence of my own and\nAlfred's eyea could be relied upon the slates were all perfectly devoid of\nwriting or marking before the performance, in addition to which as I have\nsaid I well sponged and wiped the slates myself and marked them before you\nreceived them from me.\nI may alllO state that neither Alfred or I observed the slightest\nopportunity for your writing on them by ordinary natural means.\nA. S. BLOCK.\nSITTING VI.\nMr. Ten Briiggenkate had discussed with me some of the literature\nrelating to \"slate-writing\" phenomena, including some controversy\nconcerning my own performances as \"A., the Amateur Conjurer, \"\nbut I had carefully refrained from making any statement myself con-\ncerning the exact nature of my phenomena until after the sitting.\nBeporl of MR. B. J. TIUf BRUOOBNJU.TE.\nNO'IJe1TIJwr SOfA, 1886.\nIt was my good fortune to witness last night IIOme of the moat interesting\nfeats of what appeared to be conjuring that I have ever seen. I had\npreviously had several conversations with Mr. Davey upon the subject of\nSpiritualism and slate-writing, and last evening when alone with him at his\nhouse he volunteered to give me a ~ance.\nThe room was a well lighted library, the table at which we sat was an\nordinary IIOmewhat old-fashioned Pembroke table, and the slates used were\nof the common school type, as well as one amaIl folding slate fitted with\nhinges and a Chatwood lock and key.\n[a] Mr. Davey gave me the locked slate and asked me to examine it care-\nfully, which I did and failed to find any trick or anything of the kind about it.\nThe \"medium\" then asked me to write a question upon the slate, to place a\nsmall piece of pencil between the two, to lock it up and put both slate and key\nin my pooket. I did this in Mr. Davey's absence, he havingbeen called away,\nfor a moment. Mr. Davey then took one of the ordinary slates, and placing\na splinter of pencil upon it we both held it close under the table, and after a\nlapse of a few minutes got IIOme writing upon it, the writing I remarked at the\ntime being in an opposite direction to Mr. Davey. Mr. Davey then returned\nto the locked slate, tehich had been in mypocket aU fAe time, and upon placing\nthis slate upon the table, very faint scratching was heard, and a complete\nand full answer to my question was returned. What was to me moat ex-\ntraordinary was, that Mr. Davey did not know what queation I had asked,\nand yet the answer was definite and complete.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fExperimental Investigation. 449\n[b) The next performance was even more wonderful. I took two common\nBlatea, thoroughly cleaned them, and placed some pieces of red chalk between\nthem, and we kept our handa firmly upon them; in a short time faint\nscratching was heard and upon lifting the top alate I found it to be covered\nwith writing written in a diagonal direction acroaa the alate, the writing again\nappearing in an opposite direction to Mr. Davey, i.e., as we sat opposite one\nanother it appeared as if I had written it.\n[c) The last experiment was only partially succetl8ful. Mr. Davey asked\nme to choose a book from the shelves, unknown to him, and to sit upon it in\norder that it should be invisible to him-then to write a number upon a\nslate; I wrote \"jiTJe \"-then to think of a number; I thought of .. 3e1let'.\"\nThe locked slate was again put upon the table, scratching was heard, and\nupon opening it I found a verse from page 8 line 4: of the book I had\nchosen, written distinctly upon the slate. I wish it to be observed that I\ndid not fix my mind attentively upon the number\" seven\" I had thought of\n-my attention being called off by some remarks of Mr. Davey ; also that\nMr. Davey did not know the book I had chosen, 80 that I quite fail to see\nhow he could produce any writing from the book. This ended the seance,\nand I am at a loss to conceive how the writing can poaaibly come upon the\nslate. There was not a chance of Mr. Davey being able to get at the slates\nduring the performance. When I placed the two open slates one upon\nanother with the red chalk between them, I made the remark that if writing\nwas produced upon either of them I should be ready to believe anytbing-\nfor they were covered with my hand directly they were on the top of each\nother and were never moved until writing appeared.\nB. J. TEN BRUGGBNIUTB.\nSITTING VII.\nThe next two reports are independent accounts of a sitting held on\nDecember 1st, 1886. Mr. Venner was introduced to me by a friend\nin 1885, in order that he might witness one of my performances.\nHe had previously given the question of Spiritualism some thought,\na.nd had bf'en present at several seances given by a professed medium.\nSince that time he has had frequent sittings with me, in company with\nhis own friends. Mr. Ma.nville and Mr. Pinnock I met for the fint\ntime at the sitting here recorded.\n1. Report oj MR. RoBERT VENNER.\nSeance, December lat.\nOn Wednesday, December lat, my two friends, Mr. M., Mr. P., and\nmyself attended a truly remarkable slate-writing seance given by Mr. D.\nat his own house. Neither Mr. M. nor Mr. P. have had any previous\nexperience in slate-writing ~ances. I have been present at something like a\ndozen of Mr. Do'. ; the first of the series must have taken place nearly a\nDigitized by G~Qgle\n\f450 fie P08sibilities of Mal-ObBervation, ttc.\nyear and-a-half ago. At no a4a.nce, at which I have been present, have I\nheard any theory advanced by Mr. D. to account for the production of the\nphenomena, and he has always strictly guarded himself from any claims to\nthe assistance of the supernatur&l. I collBider that this disclaimer places\nhim in a disadvantageous position, as compared to that of mediums claiming\nsimilar results as the work of spiritual agency. In the fint place, it debars\nhim from imPOling numerous most convenient conditions on the investi-\ngator; in the lacond, it deprivea him of much prestige, which cannot but\nassist the perfonner; in the third, it prevents him from pre..ing into his\nservice bad Ipirits, atmospheric conditions, &c., &c., to account for miatake\nor fa.ilure.\nThe room in which the a4a.nce took place is a small one, and is used aa a\nlibrary; it was well lighted by a couple of gas bumen. The table at which\nwe sat was of such a size that all four of us could conveniently join handa\nwhen seated; it had two fia.ps. Before the commencement of the seance we\nmade a thorough inveatigation of itll under-lide. The slates employed were\nall, with one exception, ordinary school onel; no Gennan parchment was\nused. The exception was a handsome book-slate, cased in black wood\nrellembli...g ebony, and fumished with a look. The two halves of the alato\nfitted very exactly together when closed and locked. The approximate\noutside dimensions were five inches by eight.\nAll the slates belonged to Mr. D., whom I shall in lut,ure designate as\nthe medium; we brought none of our own. The medium also provided a\nbox of crayons, mostly either red or green, a sponge, a duster, and a glass\nof water.\nMr. M. objected that the contents of the glass might contain chemicals ;\nwe therefore had it emptied and refilled.\nThe order of sitting was as follows :-Mr. P. and I occupied positions on\nthe medium's right and left hands respecth'ely, Mr. M. sat opposite\nto him.\n[d] At the request of the medium, Mr. P. wrote a queation in the book-\nslate (I shall call this slate A in future); he then looked it and pocketed\nthe key. Neither Mr. M. nor I knew the. nature of the question at the time.\nThe slate WIUI left for some minutes upon the seat of an ann-chair, but was\nsubsequently transferred fint to Mr. P.'s coat, and then to the table at\nwhich we sat. Mr. M. suggested aside to me that we should fix a hair in such\na manner to the outside of the Blate that it could not fa.il to be broken if\nthe slate were opened. I thought the suggestion a very good one, but we were\nnot able to put it into execution, no gum being forthcoming, nor any oppor-\ntunity presenting itself of distracting the medium's attention.\nThe medium showed and explained to us a means commonly employed\nin producing slate-writing by fraud.\nEzpmment No.1. [a]\nOrdinary slate taken, marked by Mr. P. and myself, and then held\nbeneath the table-fia.p by Mr. P. and the medium. We got no result during\nthe next half-hour, and Mr. P. and Mr. M. therefore changed places.\n.After a considerable interval the Bound of writing audible, and the word\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fExperimental I nVeBtigation. 451\n.. yes\" found written; the writing was weak and straggly. As nothing\nfurther occurred for some time, the original order of sitting was resumed.\nE:eperiment No.2. [b]\nThe medium requested Mr. M. to next ask a question. Mr. M.'s question\nwas something to this effect :-\" I had the pleasure of an introduction to a\nlady last night, I do not know her addreBB, and I should be much obliged by\nita production.\" After a considerable pause the word \" Marylebone \"\nwritten.\nlhperim.ent No.3. [c]\nTwo ordinary slates taken, cleaned by us, but not marked, pieces of red\nand green chalk introduced between them, the slates then deposited in front\nof the medium in full view, and about four or five inches from the edge of\nthe tabla and from the medium's body; the medium rested one of his hands\non the upper surface of the top slate, and my hand reposed on his.\nAfter a pause the sound of writing distinctly audible; this continued for\nabout 15 seconds, then the medium remarked, \"What a pity I forgot to\nask you what colour you would have it in.II Mr. M. suggested green; sound\nof writing continued for about five seconds longer, then ceased. On the\nremoval of the top slate, the bottom slate was found to be completely\ncovered with writing. The writing ran in diagonal lines across the slate;\nthe writing WIUl upside down with respect to the medium; the writing\nwas firm and distinct in chara.cter. The first three-quarters of the meBBage\nwere written in red, the last quarter in green; ita substance was as follows :-\n\"We perceive that you poasetI8 powers of a very high order, but you have\nnot done what is right for their development. SUCC8BB can only be obtained\nby industry,patience, and study, and is not this true as applied to all branches\nof human alfairs 1 Why should a man be entitled to the &8Bistance of\nastral angeloids simply because he sits at table and thinks of nothing at\nall 1 Ah, no; should you indulge in further investigation with a profes-\nsional psychic.II\nThis is the end of the red message, the remainder is in German,\nand written in green. I am not a German scholar, and I shall not give\nthe meBBage in the present report. I understand from Mr. P.* that in\nconstruction and idiom it is perfectly correct. During the occurrence of\nthe writing, as also before it took place, I watched the medium narrowly,\nbut I could obtain no clue to the meana employed. As the writing had\nbeen accompanied by some very convulsive spasms of the medium, Mr. M.\n\u2022 Mr. Pinnock wrote a report, but requested me not to publish it unless it\nwas a correct account of what occurred. I may, however, quote the following\npasa&ge, which I believe to be aecurate, with reference to the above incident.\n\" At this point Mr. Davey had Mked us if we should like to have the rest\nwritten in a different chalk (we had put a red and a green piece on the slate);\nwe assented. I at the same time thought to ask Mr. Davey to let the\nremainder be written in German, but I did notexpresa this wish aloud. To our\ngreat astonishment the firr.t part WM written in red chalk, and the next in\ngreen, the green writing being in German.II This might be described as a com-\nmunication given to the sitter, in answer to his mental request for a language\nunknown to the\" medium.\"-S.J.

[e]\nThe medium requested each of U& to take a small handful of chalks out of\nthe box on the table. Mr. P. took 11, Mr. M. Bix, and I three. The medium\ndiTided the three chalk. I had Belected between the other two. We had\npreviouBly agreed that Mr. P. 'B number should represent a page, and Mr.\nM.'e number a line, oflOme book to be choaen mentally by one of the party,\nthe medium promising to endeavour to reproduce on the elate the line 10\ndetermined. In the preeent case it was of course the eighth line of the 12th\npage.\nThe medium requested me to choose a book. I accordingly left the table\nand walked up to a emall C&I8 containing, at a rough gueBI, 60 volumes. I\nhad already selected one of theae, when Mr. M. raised the objection that,\nas I was a peraonal friend of the medium, it would be a better test if the\n1161ection fell either to him or Mr. P. The medium acquieaced.\nThe alate A was cleaned, and a fresh fragment of pencil introduced; the\nalate remained in full view with one of the medium'B hands resting on it.\nMr. M. roae and noted a volume mentally. The lOund of writing audible.\nThe meB8&gll, on examination, proved to be an address to Mr. M., but\ncontained no quotation from the book he had chosen.

You, who have atudied the queation of electricity, can the more\nreadily appreciate the wonder of these performances. We think you \"---\nThe medium aeemed angry at the appearance of this meB8&ge, which had\nno bearing on the queation asked, and expreBBed a desire that we should try\na second time. Mr. P. was therefore requeated to aelect a book.\nOn Mr. Manville asking the reason of the non-suCCeBI of the experiment,\nhe received the aDlwer \" muddle\" written on an ordinary alate.\n\u00bbxptJriment No.6.

I have also eat at a couple of dark seances\nfor materialisation. I can offer no explanation of the phenomena which\ntook place.\nRoBBJl.T F. VBNNBJI..\n2. Report of MIL E. MANVILLE.\n2nd December, 1886.\nMy friend Mr. Venner asked me to accompany him and another friend of\nhis last evening to see Mr. S. J. Davey, who, he Aid, would show us BOUle\nphenomena that would probably astonish UI. I willingly acquiesced, being\nnot only anxious to see the phenomena (of the nature of which I had been\ninformed), but also to try if I could in any way observe the means utilised\nto produce the effects. I may mention I had not seen Mr. Davey before\nthis evening, neither had Mr. Pinnock (Mr. Venner's other friend), but Mr.\nVenner had known him for some time.\nMr. Davey received us in a small library, probably containing some 300\n[over 1000.-S. J. D.] books, and during the whole evening gave me every\nassistance to examine everything used.\n[d] I first of all examined a small double slate about eight inches by five\ninches ; this consisted of two slates, each let into an ebony back ; the ebony\nbacks were hinged together on one side, and there was a hasp and lock on\nthe other side. When the slates were folded together and locked, the two\nslates were face to face, with just enough room between them for a\" crumb\"\nof slate-pencil locked in between them to move about freely. The slate was\nwashed quite clean with a. sponge and water, and dried with a cloth, and\nthen given to Mr. Pinnock to write a question on one side. This he did, and\nthen locked the slates together, retaining the key.\nMr. Davey now brought forward a table, which I examined carefully. It\nwas an ordinary table on four legs, with a flap on each sid'e ; it was made of\nwood about half-lion-inch thick; there was one drawer under the table, which\nI removed alwgether, and which was left out all the evening. After this was\ndone, there was nothing about the table which could conceal anything, and\nhad anything been concealed about the table, as far as I could see it must\nhave been in the thickness of the wood.\nMr. Davey then showed me some ordinary slates, in wooden frames.\nThese I helped him to wash and dry. We then took our seats round the\ntable. I was facing Mr. Davey. Mr. Pinnock was seated on Mr. Davey's\nright hand, and Mr. Venner on Mr. Da.vey'sleft hand.\n[d] Mr. Davey asked Mr. Pinnock to placethe locked slate under his(Mr.\nPinnock's) coat and then button up the coat.\n[c] We now took three slates, on one of them we placed three\nfragments of crayon, two of which were red, the other green, we\nthen covered up this slate with another and left them on the table in\nfull view.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fExperimental, Investigation. 455\n[a] On the third alate we also put a piece of crayon and then held\nthe slate underneath one flap of the table which we put up for the purpose.\nMr. Davey's fingers were under the slate and his thumb on the table; Mr.\nPinnock's fingers and thumb were in the Banie position. Mr. Venner held\nMr. Davey's free hand with one of his hands and one of my hands with his\nother. I held Mr. Pinnock's free hand with my other. 1 have omitted to\nsay that we all three wrote our initials in dift\"erent comers of the slate before\nit was put under the table. We aat in this way talking and smoking for some\ntime, twenty minutes to half an hour I should aay, nothing whatever\noccurring. At last Mr. Davey asked me to change places with Mr. Pinnock.\nThis I did and thus had one of my haads on the slate. Mr. Davey now said,\nthat in the manner usual at aeances we would ask questions of an imaginary\nbeing; and he said, \"Are you going to do anything to night, Joey 1\" After\na short pause he l\"epeated the question, and then I felt the alate vibrate as if\nbeing written on, and could hear a acratching noise ; we took the slate from\nunder the table-flap and aaw the word\" yes\" written over Mr. Venner'a\ninitials, and I particularly noticed that the writing was towarda Mr. Davey,\nand upside down to him, and in all we aaw afterwards this was the case.\n[b] I now asked a question as to the whereabout of a person at that time,\nnot knowing the answer myaelf; we waited for some time without any result,\nwhen Mr. Davey asked me to again change places with Mr. Pinnock.\n[d, c, g &c.] I did so, and Mr. Davey told Mr. Pinnock to place the locked\nslate on the table beside the two slates we had left face to face, and we also\nlifted tho uppermost of theae two slates and found the slates still quite\nclean, with the three pieces of crayon between them. We again waited\nsome tlffie with no results; meantime, having a diacuBBion as to mediumship\nof different people. and then Mr. Davey asked if I were a medium. After\na pause I heard vigoro~ acratchings on the two slates left face to face on the\ntable and on which Mr. Davey's arm was resting, his two hands being\nengaged, one in holding the slate under the table flap, the other in holding\nMr. Venner's hand; the acratching lasted roughly under ten aeconds, and I\nexpected to seo a dozen words or so, and was therefore amazed to discover,\nwhen the top slate was lifted, that the underneath alate was covered with\nwriting from comer to comer, and also the writing was not straight acrOBB\nthe slate, but was across it diagonally ; three-quarters of the writing was in\nred, the other quarter in green, and no crayon 1OaSleft. We read through\nthe writing, a copy of which will appear in Meurs. Venner and Pinnock's\nreport, and found that the part in green was in the German language and\ncharacters; about five words were illegible, and these, later on in tho evening,\nwe asked for, and obtained them, and still later in the evening we asked\nfor whom the writmg WaB intended, when my name \"Manville\" WaB written.\n[d] Mr. Davey now put his hand on the locked alatcs which had been left\non the table since Mr. Pinnock took them from under his coat ; we heard\nacratching inside. Mr. Pinnock then tQok the key from his pocket and\nmuocked the slate and handed it to me. I for the first time aaw the question\nwritten in it, with an answer below; the (Iuestion was \"Give me my name in\nfull if you can ;\" thtl answer was \" We are sorry we cannot do this for you,\nMr. Pinnock, perhaps we may be able to later on.\"\n[e] Mr. Da,\"ey now aaid he would endeavour to get. a srlvendm.'htn a\nDI91tlzeaby \\J\" fU(5 t::\n\f4056 The P088ibilities of Mal-Obsel'vatwn, ct;c.\ngiven page of a lI'lOk written for us. Mr. Venner therefore looked over the\ntitlea of the bouka ranged on the ahelvea and selected one fReRt4Uy. without\ntouching it with his' hands j at this moment I suggested it would be better if\nI were to select the book,&I I did not know Mr. Davey atall,whilat Mr. Venner\ndid. Mr. Daveyacquieaced. I selected a title in order to decide what line and\npage we should select. I took a pinch of craYODl from a oox, Mr. Pinnock\ndoing the lI&I1le. On counting, mine came to 6, Mr. Pinnock's to 11, Mr.\nVenner's came to 3. Mr. P. and I dh'ided Mr. V.'., making mine 8, and\nMr. Po's 12, 10 we decided that. it should be p. 12, line 8. We\nthen w&lhed the locked elatea clean, locked them, Mr. Pinnock retaining\nthe key. Mr. Davey placed his hand on the alatea, and acratching 11'&1 heard\nfor a few seconds j on the elate being unlocked by Mr. Pinnock and handed\nto me, I found it 11'&1 full of writing of a di1ferent charact.er from that we had\nseen before j it conaiated of an appeal to either Mr. Venner or myaelf, asking\nif one who _ acquainted with electricity could fail to appreciate the\ndifticulty of producing phenomena such &I we were witneaaing that e\\'ening j\nunfortunately the slate W&l w&lhed before we had taken a copy. The writing\nin this cue 11'&1 not diagonal, but straight &crOll the alate j it started aoout\na quarter of an inch from. the top of the alate, went right down to the\noottom, then 11'&1 continued round one side and finished up in the quarter of\nan inch left at the top of the alate, with two linea written'~ dotct., and\n11'&1 signed with the initiala T. P., I think. This 11'&1 interesting to UI, but\nMr. Davey 11'&1 vexed we did not get the line out of the book written, and\n10, placing the slate under the table flap, he asked the reuon j the word\n\" muddle\" was written, and we apprehended it 11'&1 on account of Mr.\nVenner and myself both having chosen a book j we therefore thought it\nwould be best for Mr. Pinnock, who knew Mr. Davey no better than I, to\nselect another book.\n[fJ This he did. We w&lhed the two elates, laid them face to face on the\ntable, when the following worda were written: \"The di1ference in this\nI't'spect... Mr. Pinnock now took down the book he had selected from\nthe shelf, and handed it to me; I opened it at the 12th page and looked\nat the eighth line. I found the first two worda completed a sentence;\nthen came the five worda aoove, and then two more to finish the line.\nI said the written worda were right, but not complete. The slate 11'&1\ncovered again, and three more words were written: \"Shakeapel\\re and\nBeaumont... On looking at the oook I found Shakeapeare W&l the 1ut word\nin the line, the other two being in the next line. I laid a word 11'&1 still\nmiaaed out. The elates were put together again, and two more words written.\nOn looking at the book thelle turned out to be the two words terminating\nthe l&lt sentence. I said there 11'&1 still the word milling, and this time the\nword .. between\" 11'31 written, making the sentence complete: \"The\ndifference in this reapect between Shakelpea1'8 and Beaumont.\" I then\naaked for the last word in the line by itself, and this 11'&1 written \"Shakea,\"\nwhich W&I correct, &I Shakellpeare W&I half on one line and half on the other.\nThe name of the book W&I Lutuf'u on Shakupeare, cl:c.\n[g] We next &lked another question, and this time had the aDlwer\nwritten on the 'UndemeaU, lide of the upper slate instead of on the 'Upper side\nof the 'UtuUmeath alate.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fExperinnentcil Investigat-iffn. 457\n[h] Mr. Pinnock asked if we could not get the writing on a piece of paper\ninstead of the slate. Mr. Davey said we might try, and thereupon tore\na sheet of writing-paper inttJ two, and pasted one half on to a. slate by the\nfour comers; he cut oft' a small piece of black lead from the end of a pencil,\nput it on the paper and covered the slate with anoiliAr sla.te. Writing was\nheard at once, and we separated the slates and found the pa.per written over\ndiagonally &8 in the ca.se of the first slate. The paper 11'&8 not, however, quite\nfull, and it looked &8 if the slates were separated too soon, &8 the sentence\n1nI8 not finished. The writing was evidently written with the point of the\npencil.\n[i] Mr. Davey 11'&8 now very tired, but he oft'ered to try one more experi-\nment. A slate 11'&8 raised on two glass blocks above the table. on top of the\nslate 11'&8 placed a piece of crayon, and over the crayon W&8 inverted a glass\ntumbler. Mr. Da.vey &8ked me what figure the crayon should draw. I said a\nt;riangle. We all joined hands and watched the crayon through the glass. After\na few minutes, the crayon not having moved, Mr. Davey placed a slate under\nthe table and &8ked if it would move, when the auswer \"No\" 11'&8 written, and\nwe then finished our evening's experiments.\nI have endeavoured in this report to merely give an account of what I saw,\nand not to give any attempt at an opinion &8 to the way in which the pheno-\nmena were produced j but this I may say, that it appea.rs to me exceedingly\nimprobable that electricity, &8 we at present understand it, 11'&8 used.\nEverything occurred under full light and between the hours of 9 p.m. and\n1.30 a.m. E.

Dtcember, 1886.\nI now send you a report of our seance as I promised, for publi-\ncation or not, j08t as you please.\n011 Mr. Davey's kind invitation I accompanied you last night to his\nhOO8a at Beckenham. There we dined, talking of telepathic and hypnopathic\nsymptoms and similarsubjects. I ought to say that my attitude W&8 that of\none totally aceptical regarding \"spirits,\" very IUBpicioul of trickery, and\nonly in the faintest degree open to conviction that BOme quasi-explanation\nfor the strange phenomena of which I had heard is to be found in the\nhypothesis of a new force or medium of tranBmiBBion. I had never before\n(as I told Mr. Davey) attended at a ~ance. I had, however, lOme hearsay\nknowledge of his wonderful performances. But I did not know his point of\nview-i.e., whether he professed to act through\" spirits\" or otherwise; and\nalthough I tried to discover thiB, hie answers and yours were so vague that I\ncould not make sure. I inclined, when the s~nce began, to the opinion that\nMr. Davey was a \"believer,\" but was somewhat reassured &8 to his bona.ftdu\nby hiB professed inability to imitate a simple conjuring trick which you\nshowed 08, and by hiB reminding me of lOme precautions which, in my inex-\nperience, I was neglecting. Lastly, I am bound to say that although &8 Mr.\nDavey's guelt I felt a little shy of showing my suspicions, I thought it all\nthe more desirable to keep a close watch. Thie I W&8 able to do as the room\nwas well lighted throughout the evening.\nI. The dinner-table was cleaTed and wheeled aside, and an uncovered\nordinary Pembroke table was brought in. You and Mr. Davey left the room\nwhile I wrote a simple question in a small double slate belonging to Mr.\nDavey, which I carefully inspected, locked and kept within sight. The\nthree of 08 then sat down at the Pembroke table, which we had examined. I\nunsealed a packet in which I had brought three new school slates; Mr.\nDavey chose one of them, which he and I, after making lure it was blank,\nheld, in the manner to be described, under the comer of one of the extended\ntable-flaps, with a small piece of pencil lying on its upper surface between\nslate and mahogany. The locked slate with the question inside was laid on\nthe table-I had not let it paBs out of my sight. Mr. Davey sat at a\ncomer, his right hand and my left meeting on the under surface of the slate\nbelow the table-flap, while you, sitting opposite him, held hie left and my\nright hand in yours. The problem as explained to me was: Given my\nquestion known to me alone; required an answer to be written upon my\nblank slate in position under the table, and to appear through some\nunexplained agency upon its upper surface where the chip of pencil lay ; the\nanswer either to give the information demanded, or at least to Ihow know-\nledge of the question.\nFor several minutes we sat thus, either in silence or discUBaing psychical\ntopics. Mr. Davey professed to expect no great success with me, anq you\nreminded him of several ~ances which, after bad beginnings, had ended\nsuccessfully. I asked some questions about the. quali_ re~uired in the\nDigitized by ~OO~le\n\fExperimental Investigation. 459\nlitter, and. BI before, received answers that did not enlighten me regarding\nMr. Davey'l ltandpoint, and therefore increued my vigilance.\nNo \"phenomena\" were forthcoming. At my reqU8lt the llate (which,\nwhile underneath, I, of course, alwaYI pre8lled fiat againlt the table) WBI now\ntr&naferred to the top IUrface of the table, another was placed over it, and\nthe pencil chip remained between, and Mr. Davey aud I laid our handa upon\nthe upper slate. No more IUCceU than before.\nThe conditions were lublequently twice varied. Firat my alate was\nreatored to ilie original position under the table (said to be the uaual one for\npreliminary manifestations), but with the atipulation on my part that I should\nkeep it pre8lled against the flap with knee as well as hand; afterwards,\ndeserting my alate altogether, we laid our handa upon the locked double\nalate containing the qU8ltion,-but all iu vain.\nFinally, when more than an hour had pasaed. two of my alatea, examined\nand found blank, were laid together, pencil between, and placed in position,\nlike the aingle slate in the first effort, againlt the lower lurface of the fiap-\nour handa alao remaining as at firat. Very soon IICratching WBI hea.rd\nalthough I could detect no movement with my eyea, hand, or knee : and,\nwhen the Slatel were brought to light, written upon the upper surface of the\nlower slate was the word .. Y8I.\" Now, as my question had been, \" Where\ndid I buy my slatea 1\"1 was not much struck by an answer that did not\napply, and might have been written by.BOme quite conceivable piece of jug-\nglery ; and my doublie were increBled when I found upon the other side of\nthe lBme slate, and therefore on the surface (such was my belief) where Mr.\nDavey's hand had r81ted, the word\" Wait.\" I Wlloll, therefore, very little\nimpr81aed by this result; and indeed, rather. to my surprise, neither Mr.\nDavey nor yourself seemed to expect me to draw any concluaion from it.1\nA subiequent experiment-in which I repeated my first qU8ltion, carefully\nexpunged from the double alate and still unknown, except to myself-\u00b7upon\none of the open slates, came to an abortive ending through Mr. Davey's\ncatching sight2 of what I had written.\nII. After an interval, Mr. Davey, who acknowledged that he was not in\na good frame of mind for \" manifestations,\" was induced by you to try the\n.. book\" experiment. This was explained to me to consist in my mentally\nchoosing from the books, which, to the number of, I should gU888. about700,\n[1000] lined the room, anyone with a clear title ; I was then to take twice over\na handful of fragmenlie of slate-pencil from a box on the table, privately\ncount each handful before repl8!ling the fragmenlie, and keep the resullie to\nmyself: the first reBult Wlloll to represent the number of a page of the book\nchosen, the second the number of a line on that page; Mr. Davey, yourself, and\nI were to lay our hands upon his double slate, laid upon the surface of the table\nafter being examinoo, found blank, and locked with pencil-chip inside by\nme; I was to concentrate my thoughlie upon the book and numbers and l\\lr.\nDavey was to try to disJover (by BOme mode of thought-transference, I\ninferred) book, page, and line: the pencil locked inside the slate was then\nto write BOme words quoted from the place thought of !\nThe preliminary programme was carried out, and I may say that while\nchoosing the book I took care to walk right round the room and not to let\nmy ey8l1inger on anyone spot. Thus the problem was: Given arhnok. .Rfi.6\nDigitized by~DU(5''-\n\f460 The Possibilitia of ~lJal-Ob8ervation, ,I\u00b7c.\nand line known only to me and recorded nowhere-required to be written\nin a blank locked slate lying under our hands the correaponding quotation,\nwhich, be it observed, was unknown Ht'U to me, for of course I had not.\ntouched, much leu opened the book.\nThis appeared hllpouible by any amount of jugglery, and I could\nacarely take the attempt seriously. We aat. down, however, and laid our\naix handa upon the alate. I concentrated my mind with the utmOlt intensity\nat my command upon book, name, and numbel'll, and lOOn Hr. Davey\nappeared to labour under lOme excitement., and, to my diaguat., began (with\nan explanation that it was the custom) to invoke lOme unseen agents in lID\nappealing tone. Presently, to my relief, he deaiated, and the attempt. was\ngiven up as a failure. Mr. Davey said he could not decide between two boob.\nAfter a short rest it was suggested that I should name the book, aDd\nthat the experiment should be resumed in a modified form. The problem\nW&l now: Given a certain book, viz., Taitle on IntdligellCfl3; required to be\nwritten in a blank locked alate,lying under our handa, a quotation unknown\nto anyone present, taken from a page and line known only to myaelf. The\nhook, of course, remained untouched on the shelf. We sat as before with\nttle alate under our handa and eyea. I concentrated my thoughts. Mr.\nDavey lOOn appeared to reach a high pitch of exaltation; his arms and body\nbecame subject to a violent \"JriM'ntt.ement.\" He again appealed to hia\nghUltly helpera, and on this occuion his efl'orta were rewarded, for, in a few\nminutes, to my utter amazement--Mr. Davey's hands and your own being\nwell in sight and unemployed-I heam BOunda of writing within the alate\nwhich continued for half a minute or more. On unlocking the alate I found,\nlegibly written, a quotation, almOlt, but not quite, verbally correct, from\npage 16 of Taine's book, beginning at. the eighth line. Some\" clear-\nobscure\" remarks, which I at once interpreted as relating to a friend of\nmine, followed.\nI had thought of the eighth line of the 28th page. The correapondence\nwas, therefore, not exact, the line only being correct. What struck me,\nhowever, was not the coincidence of the quotation, nor the gibberiah about.\nmy friend, which hinted information ouily ascertainable by anyone who,\nlike Mr. Davey, had met hhn-it W&l the occurrence of what the evidence\nof my senaes told me was writing by a piece of inanimate pencil inside a\nlocked slate, with no conceivable means of explanation 1 For a moment I\nconfell I W&l completely staggered ; my notiona of cauaation were turned\ntoply-turvy; visions of \"magnetic force\" and \"occult action\" danced\nbefore my brain. Then came the reaction; but inatead of accusing my\nseDlOl of perjury, I illustrated human nature by telling you in plain Engliah\n(during a momentary absence on Mr. Davey'S part) what opinion I had\nformed of him. I regret to think I used the word\" humbug\"; none coald\nbe lell applicable !\nI had not just then much desire to continue the Mance; butyou aeemed to\ndesire it., and &I I recovered from my bewilderment, one or two alight circum-\nstancOl-Qne of them Mr. Davey's half acquieacence in a suggOltion that he\nshould try to obtain writing without any pencil 8aMwiched in tk aatu-\noccurred to me u confirmatory of my notion that he had been alate-shaming\nin lOme very clever way. So I uked hhn point-blank,.... you 'iDmember,\nDigitized by ~008le\n\fE~ntal Investigation. 461\nwhat was his theory ; he answered that he does not 10 far profeBB any theory,\nbut merely undertakes a close imitation of the phenomena attributed by\nbelievers to spirits. 1 had not quite realised this before, and was now for\nthe first time able to appreciate Mr. Davey's standpoint-though no less in\nthe dark as to his method. We seemed, as you afterwards remarked, to\n\"have an understanding\" from this time; and with my good temper I\nrecovered my vigilance.\nIII. The last experiment consisted in my writing a question &8 at first in\nthe locked slate, to be answered by writing produced between two of my\nplain school slates by chips of pencil; the slates ha,\u00b7ing, of course, been\nexamined and found blank as usual. The slates were laid upon the table-\ntop, and except that I had unintentionally changed my seat to your former\none opposite Mr. Davey-you taking mine in exchange-the conditions were\nas before. We laid our hands on the upper slate, but after several efforts\nno result was obtained. We were proceeding to make another trial, and\nMr. Davey, in the act of displa.ying the slates to show that they were still\nblank, made a remark to you which had the effect of causing me to look at\nyou; just then, more by accident than design, I noticed that before\nreplacing the upper slate upon the lower one he reversed its position.\nSeizing it at once, I found one of its sides--that which would have been\nundemeath-covered' with an inscription which I certainly had not seen or\nheard written, and which in my delight I forgot to read. Evidently the\nnext effort would have been the SUCC8BB of the evening !\nThe game was up ; at least you and Mr. Davey chose to think so, for you\nat once let me into the secret of the great Psychical Plant. I don't profeBB\nto understand Mr. Davey's modtl.'J operandi i but of this I am certain, that\nI have to thank you for an introduction, not to a world whel't1 the rules of\nnature are superseded, but to a most surprising exhibition of sleight of\nband.-Yours very truly, JAMBS M. DoDDS.\nSITl'ING IX.\nI had never seen either of the writers of the following accounts\nuntil the day of the sitting, but I understand that they had already\nlearnt beforehand that what they were about to witness was un-\nquestionably due to conjuring.\n1. Repm-t of MR. A. B. T.\nMonday,\nDBAR MR. DAVEY,-\nGrosvenor-place, S.W.\nI am just writing a small account of what I saw you do last\nThursday night (as you requested), at Mr. T. B.'I house, when I had the\npleasure of meeting you, and witnelling your wonderful feats of\nllate-writing. The following is as near as poBBible what took place, by\nmemory: We, a party of five (exclusive of yourself), were lit~g in the\nDigitized by l::.oog e\n\f462 The P088ibilitie8 01 Mal-Ob8enJation, 4:c.\ndrawing-room, round a plain deal table with ft&pa. which had been brought\nfrom the kitchen. You provided three ordinary alatee and a unall hancbome\nlock.up slate with a lock and key. There was also a 1p0ng8, cloth. and gJa.\nof water on the table, with which I cleaned the aIatea. The fint thing you did\nwas to give me the smalllock\u00b7alate to examine, and having allured myaelf\nthat no trickery existed in it, I cleaned it and placed a unall piece of colound\npencil on it, locked it up, and put it in my pocket. The key I placed in my\nwaiatcoat pocket.\n[a] You then took a point of pencil and laid it on the table, over which\nyou placed one of the common alatee which I am poaitive I had thoroughly\nlponged and wiped. We joined our handl, and you and I placed oura firmly\non the llate. You asked your Ipirit-friend \"Joey,\" if he could give UI any\nhelp, and very lOOn after an extraordinary lOund of acratching wu heard\nunder the llate. Upon raiaing it. the following appeared in large bold lettera\nright acroll it: \"All right; here we are again. Hurrah l--.1oey.\" Thia wu\nvery aatisfactory, and \"Joey\" worked very hard to anlwer UI afterwardL\n[c] For you next held a alate with a lmall piece of pencil upon it under\nthe tJap of the table, and wished a queation to be asked. In reply to mine,\nas to when my train would arrive at Victoria, the reply came very 10011.,\n\" Wait.\"\n[d] This waa not conaidered a lufficient BIlIwer from the [Ipirit 7] world.\n10 you quickly rubbed the alate, and immediately held it ~ under the flap\nof the table. We waited lOme time. and then got lOme writing aa before.\n.. No chal,..... and on looking at the alate I aaw you had forgotten to\nplace the chalk upon it. It waa expecting too much of \"Joey\" to write\nwithout a chalk.\n[I] You then took two llatea, which I once more wiped clean, and placed\nthem one upon the other on the table, with a tiny piece of pencil between\nthem. Thore was a very Bhort wait, and then the lOund of quick writing\nwas heard. Thia lasted for nearly a minute. Upon raiaing the alate, upon\nthe top one was written as folloWB:-\n\"Dear FriendB,-It ia not 10 much the agency queation we would have\nyou aet your mindl upon, as it is the mere fact that the phenomena take\nplace under conditioDl which upon every reasonable mind preclude the\np\/Juibility (1) by known rational meana. You may reBt allured we shall do\nall in our power to co\u00b7operate with you this levening ; we mUlt, however,\nask you to have patience, as we can't carry out any testa or anlwer any\nqueBtion until we have become more In rapport with one another. Rest\n_ured and we will do our btllt, and remember Der Teuft'l ia zu zwart nit\nalB hig wei geachildered.-Joey.\"\n[J] We next experimanted with the llate which I took from my pocket.\nYou asked me to chooae a book from the bookcaae, and one of the party to\nthink of the page and line. I went to the bookcaae, and could not make\nup my mind between three or four, and finally took Virgil'B Aeneid. The\nalate was placed on the table, and \"Joey\" was again aaked to write a paaaage\nfrom the aelected book (in any coloured chalk I liked). Again the\nscratching of the pencil was heard upon the slate. When it was opened, the\npiece of chalk was nearly worn away, and reated upon the last word of the\nfollowing: \u2022\u2022 We should prefer that when you experiment for teata, such ..\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fExperimental Investigation. 463\nthe one you now propose, that you should fonn a smaller circle, and devote\nyourself exclusively to this one fonn of phenomena, and although it is not\nimpoaaible we may succeed to-night, yet we are greatly hampered by the\nco-operation of too many minds. We have no objection to try the tumbler,\nalthough we don't guarantee a -- ERNBST.\"\nThis W&B the lut experiment tried, aa time\u00b7drew on, and I wanted to\ncatch my train back to town. As to that part of the test relating to the\npaaaage chosen from the book, it failed.\nI waa very BOrry to see you in such weak health, and the excitement\nunder which you laboured showed plainly that the mental strain upon you\nmust have been great. I noticed upon every occaaion of the writing\nappearing you trembled and shuddered aa if under great nervous preBBure,\nbut why this should be, if, aa you say, these manifestations are only the\nresult of trickery and conjuring, I do not know. At all events, you have\nmystified me entirely. I do not believe in spiritual manifestation in the\nlaaat, but how you manage to bamboozle BO many people I can't make out.-\nBelieve me, Mr. Davey, sincerely yours, A. B. T.\n2. RqJort of MISS M. T. B.\nWhilat staying with my uncle at Beckenham I had the good fortune to\nmeet Mr. S. Dav9Y, and to witness BOme of his interesting manifestations. I\nhad heard of his wonderful powers, and waa therefore very pleaaed when I\nlearnt that he had accepted my uncle's invitation, and had volunteered, after\ndinner, to show UB some of his experiments.\nWe were five in number, and were seated round an ordinary deal table,\nwhich had previously been carefully examined so as to preclude any\npOBBibility of trickery.\nBefore commencing the stiance, Mr. Davey produced a book-alate, care-\nfully cleaned it, and gave it to one of our friends, aaking him to place a\nsmall piece of pencil in it, lock it up, and put it with the keylinto hiB\npocket. There it remained until later on in the evening it waa:required\nfor use.\n[a] Our first experiment waa with an ordinary achool slate. Mr. Davey\nplaced a piece of chalk on the table, sponged and wiped this slate perfectly\nclean, and placed it upon the chalk. We all joined hands, Mr. Davey rest-\ning his upon the slate. After a few minutes a faint acratching waa heard,\nand on being examined, the alate waa found to have written upon it in good\nbold characters, .. Hurrah, here we are again, Joey.\" This seemed to me\nmost wonderful, u all the time Mr. Davey's hands were visible.\n[b] Next, Mr. Davey placed a piece of chalk upon a slate, and put the\nslate under the table, supporting it with his right hand. After listening for\nsome little time, we again distinctly heard a faint scratching, and in answer\nto the question whether we should have any manifestations that night, we\nfound the answer, .. Yes.\"\n[c] Again a question W&B aaked aa to the time of the departure of the\nlaat train to London Bridge, and in reply we found .. Wait\" written UPOll\nthe alate.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f464 The P088ibilities of Mal-Observation, tl-c.\n[e) Mr. Davey then volunteered to produce writing in two cillrerentJy-\ncoloured challu, and the two aelected (blue and white) were placed between\ntwo ordinary slatee. Again we joined handa, Mr. Davey resting his, as\nbefore, upon the slates. After waiting for BOme little while (in this case\nlonger than previously) the scratching was heard, and upon examining the\nalate, it was found to be covered in writing, half being in blue chalk. the\nother half in white.\n(J] Mr. Davey now asked for the book-alate, and requested one of our\nfriends to think of two numbers, then to aelect a book from the book_.\ntaking care to keep the title of the book well in his mind. Mr. Davey pro-\nposed to produce the quotation from the chOlen page and line of the book.\nenfortunately, with this trick there was a little mistake, as ourfriend glanced\nat aeveral boob before aettling which he would linally chooae, and the quota-\ntion consequently was not produced. Instead of the quotation, BOme advice\nwas found to be written. I do not doubt that this failure was caused by the\nwant of concentration I)f mind upon the ohOlen book. With this trick I was\npartioularly struok with the fact that there was a visible diJferonce in the\nsize of the ohalk when placed upon the slate and when it waa uamined\nafter the writing had been produced, and also the remainder of the chalk\nwas disco\"ered at the end of the lut word written; boLh theae facta seemed\nto me to prove that the writing was produced by the chalk alone, and by no\nother aeoret agenoy.\nSITTING X.\nThe following report is by a Japanese gentleman whom I had met\nonce previously, and who attrihuted sundry phenomena of .. mediums,\"\nwhich had been discussed, but which he had not personally witnessed,\nto the action of some new unrecognised force.\nReport O\/MARQUIS Y. A. T.\n[a] On January 24th, 1887, I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Davey's slate-\nwriting performances in hie private room. He lint removed a table, which\nwas in the comer, into tho midrlle of the room, and brought two common\nelates, one double\u00b7slate which 08n be locked, a eponge, a box of chalk.. and\na glaas of ordinl\\ry water. Then he told me to examine and eponge and wipe\nthem thoroughly; 10 I did, and put lint the common elate, a piece of chalk\nbeing under it, and put our hands on it; a faint BOund of scratching was\nheard. When the BOund had ceased, Mr. Davey turned it out as f01l0WB :\n(No.1) was written on it.\nNo.1.\n\"Japaneae is very diffioult language to write, but we will do our best. We\nare sorry not to see Baron - - this evening, pleaae give him our kind\nregards.-JoBY.\"\n[b] Next I locked the double-alate (small piece of ohalk was put in it),\nand laid before him, and we put our banda on it while I waa holding\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fE~ntal Investigation. 465\nthe key in my hand. .As lOOn as the scratching sound had ceased\nI unlocked it and found such words as follow:-\nNo.2.\n\"A student like yOI11'\/l81\u00a3 will easily undentand the importance of this\nwriting, which, as far as the senses are able to judge, would appear to be of\na supernatural character. This,however, is not the case. In order to prove to\nyou that we are above ordinary conditions of conjurers, and also demonstrate\nthe absurdity of writing being produced by chemical action we are willing to\ncarry out any test you may suggest which would serve to dispel such a theory\nfrom those who have not witnessed these performances.\"\n[c] Again I put another common slate on the table and we put our hands\non it. In turning it we found a Japanese but really ChineBe character\nwas written.\nNo.3.\nA Chinese letter *. This letter is alBo used in Japan because the\nJapanese are UBing the Chinese characters. In Japan this letter is used as a\nverb, and means .. to be scattered\" or \" to be dispersed.\" It is pronounced\n&< Chinu \" in Japan.\n[d] Once more I locked the double-slate (this time I put white and blue\npieces of chalk in it), and put the key in my pocket and even sealed it\nmyself. In opening it I found a letter in Japanese character was written\nand also an English as followB :-\nDigitized by G~ile\n\fDigitized by Google\n\fDI91tlzedbyGoogie _\nA\n\f468 The P08sibilities of Mal-Ob8ervation, &c.\nA.\nHai tei Ihikareba taikei go-aeiko no dan haruka ni gui tatematauri 101'0\nBate wa * * * ko ni wa iksga wata.raaerare 8Oro yo. uaei mo kanete shihO no\nki-koku ye tokai taukamatauri 10ro kokoro-gumi ni gom soro aida tOkaraz\nhaibi banru kaiBhin taukamatauru beku madzu, wa yoken made sOso fagu (in\nJapanese character, with white chalk).\nJapanese, when translated, relates to my friend Prince * * * in Japan,\nand it a.lao means it is pleued to give me writing in Japanese.\nB.\nWe don't like this coloured chalk to write it u it is not short enough. Try\nsmaller piece next time. -JOEY.\nThis performance wu more than wonderful, and I could not see how any-\nthing could have been written. But I hope I will have an opportunity to\nlearn about this by reading Mr. Davey's excellent work on this subject. I\nhad uked for writing to come in blue colour, and writing in blue English\ncolour is an excuse for not doing 80, I suppose. Y. A. T.\nSITTING XI.\nMr. H. W. S., the writer of the following record, was a comparative\nstranger to me, as I had met him on only one previous occasion. He\nrequested me to give him a seance, as he had heard of my performances\nfrom some of his friends who are well-known to me. Previous to the\nsitting I informed him, as I have also informed many others, that my\nphenomena. were not to be accounted for by the \"Spiritua.listic\"\ntheory.\nReport of Mr. H. W. S.\nFebrllary 11th, 1887.\nAfter the very interesting scientific phenomena to which I wu an eye-\nwitneBS lut night, it gives me much pleaaure to detail the various utonishing\nfeats displayed by Mr. Davey [v. Clifford.]\nThe apartment in which I was received wu a well-stocked library, and\nthe furniture, including the table at which we sat, wu of the ordinary make\nand style, with none of the intricacies 80 necessary to the every-day conjurer j\nand I am convinced that the furniture of the room and ita general surround-\nings played no part whatever in the accomplishment of the facts which ~am\ngoing to narrate.\nHaving produced a small book-slate, Mr. Davey uked me to examine it,\nand to satisfy myself u to ita simplicity of construction, &c. I did 80 ; the\nslate wu composed of two ordinary pieces of slate, about six by four inches,\nmounted in ebony covers hinged on one side with two strong plated hinges,\nand closed in front, beyond the question of a doubt, with a Chatwood'.\npatent lock.\nizedbyGoogle\n\fExperimental Investigation. 4.69\nWith the exception of a small escutcheon, bearing the initials of the\ndonor, the slate was plain and substantial, and bore the strictest inspection,\nso as to entirely preclude the idea of chemicals or any other similar agent\nbeing used to it.\n[a] After I had finished examining the slate,Mr. Davey asked me to write\nin the slate any question I liked while he was absent from the room. Picking\nup a piece of grey crayon, I wrote the following question: \" What is the\nspecific gravity of platinum 1\" and then having locked the slate and\nretained the key, I placed the former on the table and the latter in my\npocket.\nAfter the lapse of a few minute8 I heard a distinct sound as of writing,\nand on being reque8ted to unlock the slate I there discovered to my great\nsurprise the answer of my question: .. We don't know the 8pecific gravity,\nJOBY.\" The pencil with which it was written was a little piece which\nwe had enclosed, and which would just rattle between the sides of the folded\nslate.\nHaving had my hand8 on t.he slate above the table, I can certify that the\nslate was not touched or tampered with during the time the writing was\ngoing on.\n[b] Next; having taken an ordinary scholar'8 8late and placed a fragment\nof red crayon upon it,Mr. Davey placed it under the ftap of the table. I held\none side with my hand as before. I tbon heard the lIIUIle BOund as previou8ly,\nand when the slate was placed on the table I found the following short\naddress distinctly written: \"Dear Mr. S--,-The substitution dodge is\ngood ; the chemical is better, but you see by the writing the 8pirit. know a\ntrick worth two of that. Thi8 medium is honest, and I am the only true\nJ OBY. \" The writing was in red crayon, and was in regular parallel 8traight\nlines.\n[0] Then, again, Mr. Davey requested me to place a small fragment of\nalate-pencil in the lock slate, which latter had been previously cleansed\nwith 8ponge by me. Respecting the method of closing the slate, &c., every-\nthing was done as in thefir'\" instance ; the slate was locked, and I retained\nthe key.\nAa soon as the BOund of writing was over, I picked the slate from oft' the\ntable, where it had been lying right under my eyes, unlocked it, and read as\nfollow8 : .. Weare very pleased to be able to give you this writing under\nthese conditions, because with your 8pecial knowledge upon the 8ubject you\ncan negative the theory of antecedent preparation of this slate as advanced\nby certain wiseacres to explain the mystery.-' JOEY.''' The fact that the\npencil when removed from tbe interior of the slate had diminished in size\nand showed distinct traces of friction, convinces me that it was the pencil\nand nothing else which produced the caligraphy. If the particles taken from\nthe pencil by friction did not go on the 8Urface of the slate, where could\nthey go 1\n[d] Laatly,as requested by Mr. Davey, I took a coin from my pocket with-\nout looking at it, placed it in an envelope and sealed it up. I am certain that\nneither Mr. Davey nor myself knew anything about the coin. I then placed\nit in tbe book-slate together with a piece of pencil,closed it as previousl:r and\ndeposited it on the table; and having placed my hands with those of Mr.\n.

In connection with this Bitting I may\nobserve that not only is it commonly the case that witnesses believe\nthemselves to have taken precautions which they did not take, but that\nthey also frequently omit to record precautions which they did take.\nIn the present instance, for example, Mr. Hayman suggested during\none experiment that it might be said that I produced the writing by\nmeans of mechanism connected with my knees; I thereupon desired\none of the sitters to look under the table during the continuance of the\nexperiment; Mr. H.

After I had washed the slate, he asked me to write down on the\ninside any question I liked, then put a piece of chalk in, lock it up, and put\nthe key in my pocket. The question I asked was, \"What kind of weather\nshall we have to-morrow 1\" He was out of the room while I wrote it down,\nand it was locked up by the time he came back ; he then placed it on\nthe table, the gas being alight ai the time, we joined hands and put them\non the top of the slate. After a little I again heard writing, and when I opened\nit there was the answer, in red chalk, each side of the slate: .. Ask the\nclerk of the weather.\" It had been written with the piece of chalk I had\nput in. I am quite certain the slate had not been opened after I had locked\nit up. lIBNRY HAnuN.\nP.S.-I may add that I watched Mr. S. J.

Whilst confirming all the details given by my friend,\nMr. H., I should like to draw attention to the fact that there were two\nwitnesses in the matter, whose evidence is undoubtedly more reliable than\nthat of ene person. Moreover, it is far more difficult to perform in their\npresence, as the observation is more intense.\n[H. W. S.]\nSITTING XIII.\nMr. Stanley W.

STANUY w. JONJI8.\nI called on Mr. S. J. l>avey, by appointment, on the evening of Friday,\nMarch 25th, 1887, bringing with me two perfectly new alates, which I had\npurchaaed that day and privately marked. I waa ahown into a well-fumiahed\natudy, but without any of the usual paraphernalia of the conjurer about it.\nAn ordinary dark wooden table with two flaps waa brought forward. which I\ncarefully examined. I pullod out the aingle drawer, finding it full of papers,\nand nothing auspicious or myaterious about it in any way.\nfa] In anewer to my request, Mr. Davey took an ordinary alate of hie\nown, which I carefully sponged and wiped. He placed the same under the\nleaf of the table, I putting between the surface of the slate and the wood of\ntable a piece of crayon. I supported one aide with my left hand, he the other\nwith his right. His left hand and my right were cluped. He asked me to\npropound lOme qMestion. I accordingly aubmitted the following interroga-\ntory: \"On what day of the week doel the 1st April fall?\" After a certain\nill~al he said, \"Let us examine the alate.\" It was raised, but apparently\npreaunted an unchanged appearance. After replacing it aa before, in a\nminute or two I heard a very faint 8Oratching, and on looking at the surface\nthe following fairly legible 80rawl appeared: \"I don't know.\"\n[b] Mr. Davey IlOW placed in my handa a small ebony-backed alate.\nwith Chatwood's lock; bidding me, while he retired from the room, write any\nquestion therein. I inacribed, \"What wu tho exact date of my birth '\"\nplacing the key in my pocket. I put, however, a new piece of crayon\ninside. The Ilate was now laid on the table and we placed our handa upon\nit. \u2022After a ahort time the 80ratching was again heard, and on unlocking\nthe alate the following perfectly legible answer appeared: \"I do not know\nyour birthday.\" The faceta of the crayon, which were perfectly unbroken\non being put in, I found worn away, and relting on the last y.\n[c] I now took the two new alatel which I had purchased, and which had\nnever for a moment paaaed out of my poueaaion, I even taking the pre-\ncaution of litting on them during the foregoing proceedinga. I placed a\npiece of red Cl\"&yon therein, and Icrewed them down top and bottom 80\ntightly that by no pouibility could e,'en the thin edge of a penknife be\nintroduced. I then corded the alates twice acl'Ollll and acl'088, aealing them in\ntwo places with red and blue wax (for of course any attempt to remove the\naeala by heat wOl\\ld caUIe the colours to fuse, and thus immediately detect\nthe artifice), ltamping them with my own private aignet. Mr. Davey placed\nthe slates under the table, and requested me to name lOme word I would\nlike written. I 8tipulated for\" April.\" After a few minutes, during which I\nmost carefully watched him, he returned them, and after 10 minutea' work,\n80 tightly were they clOled, I found exactly what I had desired.\nld] He next took hia own Ilate again, laying it upon the table, I having\npreviously placed a piece of crayon therein, and pocketing the key after\nlucking it. After a slight interval, a distinct and continuous 80ratching aa\nof regular writing waa heard, which lasted exactly 25 aeconda. On unlock-\ning the alate, the following meaaage in a clear running hand appeared:\n\" Dear Sir,-We regret to think that in thia enlightened age there are still\nto be und in,'estigators in the realm of Trixography wbqjJe ~ do not\nDigitized by l::.oogle\n\fEaperimentol I nVe8tigation. 473\naspire beyond the pencil thimble, and' half-a-crown' trick slate.

JONES.\nSITTING XIV.\nThe following account is by a gentleman who has had considerable\nopportunities of observing and taking part in experimental inquiry. I\nshall speak of him as Dr. Q. He was aware that my performances\nwere conjuring, and had read my paper in the Jowrnal of the S.P.R.\nfor January, 18M7. He had had sittings with \"slate-writing\"\nmediums, and knew precisely the object of my investigation, although\nhe did not know the methods which I employed. . His account is\nremarkably good, and I quote it chiefly to show the rapidity with\nwhich slates fastened together as described can be manipulated.\nReport of DR. Q.\n[a] I have witnOBBed thiB afternoon, about three hours ago, some remark-\nable phenomena, when sitting with Mr. Davey, which I think worthy of a\nbrief record without oomment. '!'he slSance was in a friend's room, in the\nearly afternoon, in thoroughly good daylight. An adjoining room, entirely\nIOparate from the experimenting room, gave me the opportunity of making\nmy preparations out of Mr. Davey's sight. I took three cOJ}UJlon 804001-\nDigitized by ~oo8le\n\f4740 The PO&fibilities of MaL-Observatiun, tl:c.\nroom slatee and examined them carefully by myself, teating the aecurity of\nthe jointa of the wood frames. the IOlidity of the piece of alate encl~, and\nita freedom from marks of chalk. I had brought a strong lena and ....\nthereby able to mark for identification each alate, A, B, and C, with marks\nnot visible to myown eyes without a lena. I then laid B on C and tied them\ntightly round with strong string whoae el&lticity 11'&1 very alight. The knota\nI sealed and marked the aeala. I had lert a small piece of whitish chalk\nbetween the slates. I brought them in this condition back to the experi-\nmenting room where Mr. Davey W&l, and we seated ourselves at the comer\nof a wooden table without. tablecloth. The only drawer in the table which I\ncould find had been removed. I gave the aJatee to Mr. Davey, who ....\nsitting on my left. He took them and held them in his two hands under the\ntable for a minute or more,l then gave me his left hand above the table, and\nI held it in my left hand. My knees under the table were separated by a leg\nof the table from free movement towards Mr. Davey. After two or t.hree\nminutes, during which there had been lOme conversation, he &lked me to\nsuggest lOme word whioh should be written between the aJates. I said at\nfirst VladiV08tok, but &I he thought this inappropriate I changed it for\nHong Kong. I heard scratching lOunds, but observed Ie.. movement of Mr.\nDavey's right elbow than there had been before. After a minute or two he\nreproduCtld the alates and asked me to examine them and see what had been\nwritten inaide. I found no appreciable displacement of the string. no change\nin the seals, and the marks of identification were clear. I cut the string.\ntherefore, and opened the aJates. On one I found rather indistinct acratchea\nin an apparently continuous line, of which one-half bore a conaiderable\nresemblance to a badly-written Hong; the other half W&I of about equal\nlength, but not decipherable.\n[b] I retired to the preparing-room to make ready for another experiment.\nI drew on the internal 8urface of B five vertical lines, and on the internal\n8urface of C five vertical and five horizontal lines with the fragment of\nwhitish chalk and tied and sealed them &I before. This time I thought that\nthe appoBition of the edges W&I more complete and Becure than before. I\nbrought them to Mr. Davey, and after they had been handled &I before, I\nasked that the word Irishman should be written, but there W&I no BUOOO88 i I\ndid not find any appreciable alteration on the inaide or outside of the alate&.\nMy left knee had been under the apparent position of Mr. Davey's right\nband.\n[c] In the third experiment the 8aJlle alatea were used; they were prepared\nin Mr. Davey's presence. They were tied and the knota sealed and also two\nscrew naila were driven through the wooden frames of both alates, one at\nwhat I JOay call the lOuth-eaat comer and the other at the middle of the\nnorth end. This made firm and satisfactory apposition of the frames in the\nneighbourhood of the screWB. The screws were not sealed, but the position\nof the fine broken woody fibres round them W&I noted. I did not succeed in\nmaking the tied string quite &I tight &I in the previous experiment. I noticed\nno dillerence in the manipulation of the aJates from the firat two experi-\nmenta. I made no attempt to touch Mr. Davey'. hand with my left knee. I\n&lked that 77 should be written, and after a few seconds explained\nmyself by laying that they should be written out in full, not in nwnbera.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fExperimental Investigation. 475\nThe slates were brought above the table in le88 than a minute after this. I\ncould find no change externally, and written inside I found the figures 'i7,\nand also a fairly well-formed ,. Sev,\" followed after an indistinct interval by\nsigna resembling\" ty,II and these also by some almost indecipherable scratchel.\n[d] For a fourth experiment I prepared the Bame alates in the adjoining\nroom. A fresh screw was fixed in the previous hole near the south-east comer,\nand another was paued through both frames a little below the north-west\ncomer. The exact position of the heads of the screws was noticed, but\nthey were not sealed. I carefully examined the piece of chalk left between\nthe slates with my lena, and found two smooth rubbed facets on it. These\nand the other rough surfaces of the irregular polygonal JIlIII8 I marked with\nvery finely cut linea. The slates were tied with thinner and more yielding\nstring, and the knots sealed. A ratherfragile drop of lealing wax was placed\non the junction of the croued strings over the middle of the slate. The\nchief object of the experiment was to test the rapidity with which the\nphenomena occurred when Mr. Davey was not under my observation. I was\nto stand with my back to Mr. Davey, to hold out the slates to him behind\nmy back, and to order lome word which was to be written between them\nbehind me out of my sight, and the slates returned to my hand behind my\nback as lOOn as pouible. I was to note the time spent on this. On a first;\nattempt I held out the slates behind my back Baying, \"commandment.II Mr.\nDavey took them, asking at the Bametime what was the word required. 1 BaW\nthat I had not made myself plain, turned round and took back the\nslates within one or two seconds, and found no change externally except that\nthe fragile drop of sealing wax on the croued strings was broken. I took the\nslates back again to the preparing-room, and put on another similar drop.\nOn a second trial I again said, \"commandment,II putting the slates behind\nme with my left hand, holding my watch in my right, and keeping my back\nto Mr. Davey. They were returned to my hand in 30 or 31 seconds. Some\nBOunds which might be described as shuflling and scratching had been heard\nby me. I laid them on the table, and on examination found no\nchange externally; then cut the strings and found on the inner\nlurface .. commandment\" written more distinctly than the previoul\nwords had been and near the edge I. of the slate. Whilst I was\nlooking at the word Mr. Davey touched and to some extent broke the piece\nof chalk. In examining it afterwards with a lena I found only two Imooth\nrubbed facets, each of which was still marked with the finely cut line I had\nmade on it : over lome only of the remaining rough surfaces could I find the\nfine lines that I had previoully made over all. I made no accurate compari-\nIon between the marks I could produce on the alate by the whitish chalk\nand those fonning the worda or parts of words. In no case was the piece of\nchalk large enough to touch both internal surfaces at the Bame time.\nMarch 25th, 1887.\nSITTINGS XV. AND XVI.\nMiss Symons Wa.tl introduced to me by Mrs. Sidgwick on the day of\nour tirst sitting. I gave to her and Mrs. Sidgwick three sitti~ in aU, of\nDigitized by l::.oogle\n\f476 The P088'ibilities of Mal-Observation, 4:c.\nthe second of which, a dark .nce, she wrote no account. As I have\nalready stated (p. 415, note), I shall not quote the accounts written by\nMrs. Sidgwick, as I had told her a good deal about my tricks beforehand,\nand she knew that my perfonDances were conjuring. Notwithstanding\nthis, however, Mrs. Sidgwick was unable to explain BOme of my\nphenomena. At my request, she has furnished BOme notes concerning\nthe reports of Miss Symons, and she also makes the following statement:\n\"I did not communicate what I knew about Mr. Davey to Mias\nSymons till after the second seancehere recorded, as my object in taking\nher to the seances was to obtain an account of what ahe witnessed,\nwrittt-n as nearly as possible in the BRme state of mind as when ahe\nwrote certain accounts (printed in the Journal of the S.P.R. for June,\n1886) of Mr. Eglinton. I therefore merely represented Mr. Davey asa\nperson through whom remarkable phenomena occUJTeCi, which I wanted\nto have investigated. Mr. Davey himself seemed to nle (as I have\nrecorded in my note-book) to talk very openly to Miss Symons. He\nseemed to tell her almost as much as he had told me about his tricks and\nthose of other' mediums,' but it was doubtless mixed up in a mystifying\nway. Unfortunately, Miss Symons had great confidence in my care as\nan investigator, and, without revealing the actual situation, I could not\nsucceed in making her feel herself dependent entirely on her own\nobservation. It is due to her to state this, as, had she left me out of\naccount she believes ahe would have used more precautions than she\ndid, and she considers that she was more careful in her investigation of\nMr. Eglinton than in that of Mr. Davey.\"\nThese sittings were the earliest I gave which were recorded in\ndetail; my experience then was comparatively limited, and I have\nsince become much more practised in certain methods, and have\nalso acquired the knowledge of new ones.\nSITTING XV.\n&port of MISS SYMONS.\nSlate-writing aN.nce, November 16th, 1885, at U, Dean'l-yard, with Mrs.\nSidgwick, and a medium whom I will delignate .. Mr. A. [changed through-\nout to D., lee p. '10]. Our litting commenced at 7.~ p.ID. We took our\nplacea round a deal table in the following order :-The medium Mr. D. at\none comer, next him MI'II. Sidgwick, and I oppoaite.\nNeither MI'II. Sidgwick nor I had brought any llatel, and we were,\ntherefore, obliged to UIe thOle brought by Mr. D. We ..t in a good light, a\nlamp and several candlel were burning in different parte of the room. We\nfil'llt waahed the alates ourselves with water brought us by Mr. Podmore, 80\nthat there waa no question of ita containing any admixture of chemicaIa, by\nwhich means writing might be produced,.. haa 80metimel been suggested\nto me ; the table, too, was above sUBpicion, having just been boU\u00a3ht by Mr.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fExperimental Investigation. 477\nPodDiore for this particular aMnce. After each one of us had separately\nwaahed and dried the slates, one was marked by Mra. Sidgwick, a piece of\npencil waa placed on it, and it waa held by Mr. D. under the table, who warned\nus to watch him very carefully, aa he gave no promise ?lot to cheat, did we\ngive him the faintest opportunity for so doing, and who wished us distinctly\nto underatand that he did not claim to produce the phenomena he hoped to\nshow us, by spirit agency. Prior to placing the ordinary slate under the table,\nwe had waahed and examined a small double folding slate, also belonging to\nthe medium. This alate waa locked by Mra. Sidgwick, who put the key in her\npurse, and the purae in her pocket, and who aat upon the slate.\nThe single marked slate, of which I have previously spoken, waa now\nheld by Mr. D. under the table. We joined hands, and contented ourselves by\nasking merely that any word might be written, or the single word .. Abbey.\"\nThe medium, after the lapse of a few minutes only, sllowed himself very\nimpatient at no writing having been produced. He proposed using another\nalate, which had &lao been waahed and dried by us. Another piece of pencil\nWIUS tried; these and other movements-for he constantly moved the slates to\nascertain whether anything had been written-made it much more difficult\nto watcll him narrowly, than had he been content to wait quietly and\npatiently for results. Still I waa not able to detect any change of slates\nbeyond the two which had been waahe<l and cleaned by us. No writing had\nappeared, and Mr. D. soon proposed that we should try the following test,\nsuggested by him.\n[a] One of us was to stand with a newspaper on a table belUnd us,\nand with one finger waa to point at random at any word; the other waa\nto sit at the deal table with him. It was agreed that I should be the one\nto point to a word on the newspaper behind me, and I took up my position\nfor this purpose at another table, about a couple of yards from the\none at which Mra. Sidgwick and Mr. D. were sitting. We had waited a few\nseconds only when the medium-who, 118 I have said before, seemed restless\nand impatient throughout the evening-suggeated that I should blowout the\ncandles behind me, as he thought darkneaa behind the paper might facilitate\nthe accomplishment of the teat. I complied, and returning to the table\nagain placed my hand behind my back, and put my finger, aa before, at\nrandom on auy pan of the paper. I had no eooner done aa he had asked,\nthan Mr. D. regretted that I should ever have moved from my place, aa he\nthought it poaaible that the word written-if writing came at all-would be\nthefirat and not the second word to which I had pointed. It waa not long\nbefore writing waa heard. Mra. Sidgwick and Mr. D. turned to the caudle\nbehind them, but were unable to decipher the word written. Mr. D. aaked that;\nit might be re-written. Another slate was used, on which they presently\nread the word \"Melbourne.\" We then turned to see the word at which I\nwaa pointing. It waa, however, not\" Melbourne,\" neither was that word\nanywhere in the immediate neighbourhood of my finger, though we did\nafterwards find it in larger type, and two columns further on. Whether I\nbad at firat pointed to this word, could not of course be aacertained. It is\npossible that I did BO, though a test which we tried later on, and to which I\nshall presently allude, proves that the \"control\" was not incapable of\nmaking a mistake. As to whether this word was obtained under good\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f478 The Possibilities of Mal-Observation, tl:c.\nconditions I cannot give an opinion. u I wu not sufficiently near Ute\nmedium to be ahle to watch him closely.\n[b] We next revened our pOilitioDl, Mrs. Sidgwick sitting opposite Mr. D.\nand I next him; the double slate remained on the chair on which I aat.1 After\nagain wuhing two slatea. al.d placing one on the top of the other, Mr. D. and\nI together held them under the table ; they were once or twice removed to see\nthat the pencil wu still there, and that no writing had come, but alway.\nroturned imntediately, and they were not revened or changed by Mr. D., 80\nfar u I know, whilst we were together holding them, up to the time when we\nagain apparently heard the scratching of the pencil. We found, on carrying\nthe slatea to the light, that there wu a meuage of moderate Ieogth covering\nhalf t.he slate, and signed .. J.S...\n[c] Agsin we sat u before, and under the aame conditioDl writingcame on\none of the two slates held by Mr. D. and me under the table, half the meuage\nbeing in red chalk and half in blue-a bit of each had been placed on t.he\nslate. Again I could detect no trickery whatever; the slates were clean\nwhen we laid the bits of chalk between them, and one wu covered with\nwriting when they were remo\\E'd from the table. Unfortunately the a1ates\nhad not been marked, and I did not notice whether the bit of chalk was\nrosting at the lut IItroke of the lut word, or whether the nib 1r&I at all\nworn down. The mellMge wu of decided interest, it was u follows :-\" My\ndear Friends,We have no wish to deceive you as regards the Agency question.\nThe name of a deceased relative, especially a mother, is [far too sacred,\nalthough] mOlt effective,\"&C.-the ordinary Spiritualiatic jargon-then, ..Our\nfriend made a mi8take the other night, dear Miss S. Agradezco Ii V. 8U\nviaita. Espero que Ie volnero , ver Ii V. pronto. Tengo que macharme,\nA DiOl.\" Then the mellll&ge continued: .. Yea, your haunted house _ a\nfailure.\" The lut part of this sentence was too badly written to be\ndeciphert>d ; it appeared to be to the effect that the writer had not been able\nto be present. Now this mesRage appears to me to be ,trikiug, though not of\ncourse conclu8ive. I mU8t explain that about a month ago I had had a Bitting\nwith Mr. Eglinton for 8late-writing, and had asked a question in Spanish, to\nwhich I had had the rE'ply that ..there wu no French scholar present.\" Hence\nthe rouon of the remark \u2022\u2022Our friend made a mistake tile other night,\" &e.\n(the former seance had taken place in the day-time). This meuage, which\nhad amused me at the time, had by no means been forgotten by me,\nalthough it had not been in my consciouB thoughts for many days, and cer-\ntainly not during the seance of which I write; it wu known to Mn. Sidgwick\nalBO, to whom I had written an account of the seance with Mr. Eglinton BOOn\nafter it took place. But what caused an allusion to this seance of a month\nago, and through the agency of a medium who it. seems improbable could\nhave heard of this former seance 1 However, u I have said before, intereating\nand striking though thiB'message appears to be, it giVeB no proof of thought-\ntranaference, 81 Mr. D. may have heard of the seance through BOrne ordinary\nBleanB, though from his converaation he appeared to be on any but intimate\ntemtB with Mr. Eglinton, and he was quite unknown to me and I believe to\nMrs. Sidgwick (1) before we met him on this ovening at Dean's-yard. He also\ntold U8 that he did not know a word of Spaniah. Still, it would have been no\nvery difficult task to have got a few sentences written for this particular\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fE:cperirrumtaJ, Investigation. 479\naeance, and there was nothing in the mellllllge from beginning to end which\nmight not have been written previouB to the BtSance. But admit-\nting all this, I was not consciouB of any movement by which he could have\nchanged a cleaned IIlate, which I was holding with him, for one on\nwhich the m8111111ge was written. The allUBion to the haunted houBe is 1_\nBtriking, for Mr. D. iB known to Mr. Podmore, and might have heard of it\nthrough him, or many other BOurces.\n[d] We next tried for writing on the locked Blate. I must remark here that\nthough we had sat on this slate during the greater part of the lMSance, we had\nnot done BO throughout. We had left it on the chair when we turned to the\ncandles behind UB to read the meBBag8. Mr. D. had quickly picked it up, and\nasked us not to 100e Bight of it, as he wished to preclude all pOBBibility of\nfraud. He might, of COUl'B8, in this moment I have changed the slate for one\non which a mellllllge was already written, but the nature of the test we\nobtained, I think, negativeB this suppOlition; besideB which, before it was\nheld under the table, Mrs. Sidgwick gave me the key, we unlocked the\nIIlate, found no writing there, and after the slate was again locked, I put the\nkey in my pocket.3\nIt was now proposed by Mr. D. that we should try to obtain a line from\na page of any book to be taken at random from Mr. Podmore'B shelveB. This\nwas done by Ml'8. Sidgwick, who took care only-at Mr. D.'s request-to\nselect a book with good type. This book was shown to Mr. D., who opened\nit, looked at the type, and considered it lufficiently clear. Mrs. Sidgwick\nplaced it on the table, and her and my handa rested on it, whilst Mr. D. and\nI held the small locked slate under the table. It was at this point, after\nchOOBing her book, that the IIlate had been opened, found clean, and the key\ngiven to me. It was decided that Mrs. Sidgwiok should think of the page of\nthe book fJ'om whioh the line Wall to be taken, and I of the line, counting from\nthe top of the page, it being agreed-at Mr. D.'s wish-that to facilitate the\ntest, we Bhould each think of a number below 10.\nAgain, BO far as I could Bee, we gave Mr. D. no opportunity for changing\nthe Blate. I am quite certain that he did not do BO whilst we were holding it\ntogether. And in this case the m8B8&ge must have been written in our\npruence, as we did get a line copied from this very book, though not the line\nof which we were thinking. When the Blate was again unlocked, we found\nwriting on each Bide ; the meBBage was to the effeot that we were not\nsufficiently en rapport with one another to get the best results as yet, but\nthat they were willing to give us BOrne proof of their power. Then followed a\nfew worda in inverted commas, after which an illegible word, with which the\nmeuage broke off abruptly. Mrs. Sidgwick then explained that Bhe\nhad been thinking of page 9, and I had thought of line 4. Mrs. Sidgwick\nquickly turned to this page and line, but no BUch WOrdB as thOle quoted were\nto be found. Mr. D. BuggeBted that the 9 in Mrs. Sidgwick'B mind might\nhave been reversed and wrongly read as 6. We, therefore, turned to page\n6, and on the last line of that page and the first line of page 7, we found the\nworda for which we were looking.\nIn this case-admitting the genuinen8BB of the phenomenon-there might\nagain have been thought-transference, for the book had been in both Mrs.\nSidgwick'B and Mr. D.'B hand, and either might have caught sightof theBe ve~\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f480 The Po88'ihilities of Mal-Observatio-n, c\/;c.\nwords. With this the _nee ended, as Mr. D. expresaed himself too tired\nto sit any longer, and complained of a very bad headache. He aeemed to\nsuft'er much after each meuage had been produced, and complained of g..-t\ndryn_ of the throat.\nJ\u00a38III1!: H.

Sidgwick and myself present ;-\nI took alates with me-two ordinary onN, and ORe a folding alate, framed\nin wood, with a padlock and key.\n[a] We first used the ordinary slates; they were cleaned, dried, and placed\none on the other upon the table, a nib of pencil between them, and Hra.\nSidgwick's, medium's, and my banda resting on them. No writing being\nheard, Mr. D. and I held them underneath the table. Eventually, however,\nwriting was produced whilst the slates were on the table in position I have\nbefore deacribed. The measage was a long one, covering completely one aide\nof slate. We examined them when they were placed the second time on the\ntable, and satisfied ourselves that they were clean. I am sure that the slates\nwere not changed, because mine had rounded comers and Mr. Do's, I\nobserved, were Bquare.1\n[b] The medium nextasked me to fetch a book from the outerroom. I took\none at random from the shelves of the library. Mr. D. saw me take it out,\nbut did not touch it. I brought it into the inner room and put it on a chair\nbetween Mra. Sidgwick and myself, whilat we prepared another slate and bit\nof pencil. Being again satisfied that the slates were clean, the book-into\nwhich I had not looked, and the namo of which I did not know-was plaoed\non the slate, all our hands resting on it as before. 1 mentally thought of a\npage and line, from which a quotation was to be made, both numbers, at\nmedium's request, being under 10. After a short time writing was heard.\nOn the slate was written... Cantor lecture will be given on Mondays at the\nKensington Museum-this is all we have power to do.\" We looked at p. 2,\nline 7, the numbers I had thought of, but did not find the words quoted.\nThe medium, however, was very sure that they would be found somewhere\nnear, and he lOOn discovered on last line of p. 7 .. Cantorlecture,\" and on\nsecond line of p. 8 .. will be given on Mondays,\" and a few lines further\ndown, \"at the Kensington Museum.\"\n[c] The teat having been only a partial IUccess, the medium proposed that\nwe should try it again. He asked me to fetch a second book from the outer\nroom. 1 took up a JoumaJ. of the Society lying on the table. I did not look\nto see which number I had chosen. Medium asked me to think again of two\nnumbers under 10, to determine page and line from which quotation should\nbe made. I did so, and very shortly after was written in red chalk, \"No\nluch page.\" This was true, for on opening volume we fowld it commenced at\na hundred and something.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fExperimental Investigation. 481\n[d] Mr. D. wished to try this test again. 10 I fetched a third book. This\nbappened to be Time-both he and I saw the title. This time I told him\nwhich numbers 1 was thinking of-po 8, line 5. We held one elate under\nthe table, and another with the book on it remained on the table-both\nthese elates were Mr. D.'s. Aftera time writing was heard, and it was on the\nupper slate that we found the quotation, correctly given this time, \"The\nImperial Parliament,\" line 1, and then a few words taken from line 5. The\nslato used was \" large folding one, with a lock, belonging to medium. Into\nthis he slipped a sheet of paper and a bit of lead pencil ; it was on the paper\nthat the quotation was written. Mrs. Sidgwick had the key, and it was she\nwho opened the slate.s The seance was held by full gaslight. The writing\ncame always on underneath surface of elate-that lying nearest the table.\n[e] Mr. D. then proposed showingua anothertrick.s He took up 12 squares\nof paper, asked me to name any 12 animals I liked, whose names he wrote\non the 12 squares ~f paper. These were shutBed together, and I was asked to\nchoose one, which I WM to glance at and then instantly to bum. Mr. D. at\nthe same time threw the other squares into the fire. I next wrote the first\nand last letters of the animal I had chosen on another piece of paper, this\nMr. D. burned in the gas, bared his arm and showed us that there was\nnothing written there, rubbed the aBhes of the burnt paper over the bare\narm, and presently what looked like letters became very faintly visible.\nThey did not, however, become sufficiently distinct to enable us to read\nthem, and Mr. D. said he would presently get the animal's name written on\na slate.\n[j] We sat round the table again, as before-Mrs. Sidgwick opposite\nmedium and I next him. One slate was held underneath table by Mr. D. and\nme, and the others were left on the table, with our hands resting on it. I\nasked that the names of my sisters might be written-this was not done.\nNeither did\" Joey,\" in answer to Mrs. Sidgwick's question, succeed in telling\nus where we had spent the greater part of the day. \"Joey\" was allO\nunable to get any wnting on my little folding locked slate, though we gave\nhim two or three times the opportunity of doing 10.\n[g] Mr. D. asked him to tell us any secrets about either of us, and we\nheard the lOund of writing on the slate lying on the uppersurface of the table.\nThe lOund continued, when Mr. D. withdrew his hands ashort distance from\nthe elate, but ceased when he withdrew them to a greater distance. A long\nmessage was written again, covering the whole side of the elate, and com-\nmencing at a spot where the medium had previously requested itto commence\nby putting a small cross.\nThe \" secrets .. were such as were more or less known to us all, referring\nto a possible explanation I had given of our last seance with Mr. D. to\n\"Blue Bricks,\" and telling me that I could get slate-writing if Isataufficiently\noften, and \" not with Mrs. Sidgwick .. I I\nOne of our messages at request was written in dift\"erent-coloured chalks,\nthree bits of which had been placed on the table, underneath the elate.\n[h] The last experiment Mr. D. mowed us was the visible moving of the\nohalk under an inverted tumbler.\nTwo bits of chalk were placed on a slate, the tumbler covering them j\nthe elate was isolated from the table. Mr. D. held Mrs. Sidpjck's apd\nDigitized by~008le\n\f482 T~ Po88ibilit\u00b7ies of Mal-ObsertJation, &c.\nmy hands, and there was no contact by either of us with the alate.\nPreaently one bit of chalk was obeerved to move slightly. Mrs. Sidgwick\nasked it to trace the figure , (Mr. D. having proposed that she should chooae\na number under 10), and on removing the tumbler and inapecting the alate,\nwe found the figure , IOmewhat faintly traced on the alate. I do not belieT.\nthat this was a genuine phenomenon, though I have no theory as to how the\ntrick was performed. I only obeerved that though the chalk moved, it did\nnot appear to be forming a \" although that figure was plainly visible when\nMr. D. afterwards gave us the alate.\n[i) Before he left, Mr. D. held a alate with me under the table, and asked\nthat the name of t.he animal written on the slip of paper I had choeen should\nbe written on the slate. Writing was heard, 'he alate brought up. and I\nfound\" rhinoceroe \"-wrongly apelt-\u00b7in red chalk. This wu-correct, though\nhow Mr. D. knew, or by what means the word was written, I have no idea,\nfor the alate appeared to me to be clean \u2022 when we put it under the table.\nJB88IB H. SYJ(ONS.\nFebruary 23rd, 1886.\nSITTING FOR MATERIALISATION.\nThe foregoing reports have all related to \"Slate-writing,\" or ana-\nlogous phenomena. I have, however, also given a few sittings for\n\"Materialiaation,\" and I may in the future endeavour to exhibit more\nfully the pOBBibilities of trickery in this direction, but this branch of the\nsu~ject has been of leas interest to me, partly because the experiences\nwhich originally impressed me in connection with Spiritualism were not\n\" Materialisation \" but\" Slate-writing\" phenomena-partly because the\ntestimony offered by Spiritualists for the genuineness of the latter\nappears to be so much superior to that offered in favour of\n\u2022\u2022 Materialiaations.\" Still, the following reports of a seance which I\ngave last year may be instructive by way of suggesting what may\nbe done by trickery. Although only three of the six sitters wrote\nrt'porta, none of them contributed in the smallest degree to the\nproduction of the\" phenomena.\"\n1. Report OJMBB. JOHNSON.\nOctober 7th, 1886.\nI have just retumed from paying a quite unexpected visit to Mr. Davey.\nWe had invited him to our house for to-morrow to give us one of his\nwonderful manifestationa, but received a bad account of his health, which\nprevented him keeping his appointment. I, therefore, with my sister, called to\ninquire after him, and found that, although unable to leave the hoU8e, he wu\nabout to hold a IMWlce with lOme friends, and invited us to join them.\nOn entering the dining-room we searched every article of furniture, but\ncould find nothing that. could in any way aaaiat in the materialiaation which\nfollowed. Mr. Davey alIIO tumed out his pockets, and we looked under his\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fEa;perime:ntal I'nvestigation. 483\ncoat and waistcoat. After the door was locked and sealed, and the gas turned\nout, we, six besides Mr. Davey, sat round a table, all joining hands. I had\nhold of Mr. Davey's left hand and a gentleman opposite of his right, none\nfor a moment letting go until the end of the aeance. A musical box was\nplaying on the table; by degrees it floated about and knocked a gentleman on\nthe head. Knockings were heard in different parts of the room, and bright\nlights seen. A gong BOunded several times, and then appeared the head of\na woman, which came close to us, and then dematerialised. After a few\nseconds another form appeared, the half figure of a man holding a book, with\nlambent edges, which it raised over its head, moved close to us, bowed\nseveral times, and by degrees seemed to disappear with a scraping noise\nthrough the ceiling. During the aeance I with the. others had various taps\non the head and body, a gentleman complained of the coldness of a hand\npressing on him, and the stSance was altogether a most interesting, remark-\nable and startling phenomenon, and I can in no way account for it.\nMARu.NNB JOHNSON.\n2. &pori of MIss WILLSON.\nDBAR MR.

You had kindly promised to come to my sister's house to-morrow\nevening to give ua a \"materiaJisation,\" and perhaps some slate-writing, but'\nhaving received a telegram and letter from you saying you must disappoint\nus, as your doctor had forbidden you for the present to exert yourself much\nor to be out in the night-air, my sister and I called to-day to inquire after\nyou.\nWe found you at home, and you persuaded us to stay to a short aeance.\nSeven of us, including yourself, entered the dining-room, which we\nimmediately examined, looking under the tables and sofa, behind curtains,\ninside the cheffonier, &C. After convincing ourselves that nothing was con-\ncealed, and you having turned out your pockets, we locked the door, and\nplaced a sealed paper acroBB it. We then sat round the dining-table, holding\nhands in a circle, a musical box was placed on the table, and the gas turned\nout. In a short time we heard raps in various parts of the room, a gong\nsounded in one corner, the musical-box, playing,floated in the air, and struck\nthe head of one of our party. Several felt theIUBelves touched, and one said\nhe distinctly felt a cold hand placed on his head.\nA female head appeared, in a strong light, floating in the air, and after-\nwards a ha.lf-Iength figure of a bearded man, in a turban, reading a book,\nappeared in the same manner, bowed to some of the 888embly, raised\nhis book above his head, and floated about the room, fina.lly disappearing\nthrough the ceiling with a scraping noise.

M. WILLSON.\n3. RqJort of MR. RAlT.\nOn Thul'llday evening. the 7th October, 1886, I was present at a &&moe\nheld by Mr. Davey, at his house. There were in all eight* persons, myself\nincluded. We took our seats at 7.30 p.m., round an ordinary dining-room\ntsble (in the dining-room of the house), which, at Mr. Davey's request, we\nexamined carefully, as also any other objects in the room which demanded\nour atteution. The door \u00b7of the room was locked, and I placed the key in\nmy pocket, it was also sealed with a slip of gummed paper ; the gas was\nthen turned out. so that we were left in darkneaa. A musical box was\nwound up, and aet to play an air, with the object, as I suppoatl, to enliven the\nproceedings! I held Mr. Davey's right hand. hialeft was held by Mrs. [John-\nson] ; the rest joined hands, so that during the seance a continual chain W&I\nformed which was maintained the whole time. After we had remained\nsome time thu., various noises 1!8 of a ahuftling of feet, &0., were heard. in\ndifferent parts of the room, and I distinctly felt somethinggrasp my right foot;\nalmost immediately I was touched on the forehead by a cold hand, which, at\nMr. Davey's request, also touched those that wished it. The musical box\nwas lifted, and although it was dark I fancied I asw it, surrounded by a pale\nlight, descend through the air ; it certRinly struck me lightly on the aide of\nthe head, then it was again raised, and deposited on the table.\nThe hand which touched me was cold and clammy; it evidently belonged\nto a most courteous and obliging spirit, for it did exactly what we desired!\nand at my wishing to feel the full palm on the back of my head (so as to\nascertain its shape and size) it TeSted there for fully three seconds; it _,\nhowever, a somewhat weird experience I Various raps were now heard, a\ngong aounded behind my back, and we were told by Mr. Davey to pay\nattention, as 8'lmething wonderful was about to take place. Faintly, but\ngradually growing more distinct, a bluish white light appeared hovering\nabout our heads; it gradually developed more and more till at lengtq we\nbeheld what we were told was the head of a woman. This apparition was\nfrightful in its uglineaa. but so distinct that every one could see it. The\nfeatures were distinct, the cheek bones prominent, the nose aquiline, a kind\nof hood covered the head, and the whole resembled the head of a mummy.\nAfter favouring those of the company who wished to see its full face by turn-\ning towards them, it gradually vanished in our presence. The next spirit form\nwas more wonderful still ; a thin streak of light appeared behind Mr. Davey,\nvanished, appeared again in another part of the room, and by degrees\ndeveloped into the figure of a man. The extremities were hidden in a kind\nof mist, but the arms, shoulders and head were visible. The figure was that of\nan Oriental. a thickblack beard covered his face. hishead was surrounded by a\nturban; in his hands he carried a book whichheoccaBionallyheldabove his head,\nglancing now and then from underneath it. The face came once so near to\n\u2022 Seven. See the other reports.-S. J. D.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f485\nme that it appeared to be only two feet from mine. I thus could examine it\nclosely. The eyes were stony and fixed and newr f1WI7ed once. The com-\nplexion was not dusky, but very white; the expression was vacant and\nlistless. After remaining in the room for a few seconds, or rather a minute,\nthe apparition gradually rose, and appearod to pass clean through the ceiling,\nbrushing it audibly as it passed through. The ~ce here terminated ; the\ngas was turned on again, and everything appeared the same u when we first\nsat down; the door was unlocked, the seal being found intact. I will\nmention t.hat during the whole of the ~ce I held Mr. Davey'S right hand,\nwith but one exception, when it wu found necessary for him to light the gu\nto see to wind up the musical box, u it had stopped playing. Nothitlg teal\nprepared beforehand; the Blame teal quite caauaZ; we could have sat in any\nroo~ we wished, and we had full liberty to examine everything in the room,\neven to the contents of Mr. Davey's pockets, which were emptied (before\nbeginning the ~ce) by him on the table before our eyes !\nOctober 8th, 1886. JOHN H. RAlT.\nNow I should have no hesitation whatever in challenging\nSpiritualistic \"mediums,\" or any other persons, to reproduce the\nphenomena described in the various reports which I have quoted,\nwndwr the conditions described by the witn688tJ8. I need hardly say that\nnot one of these detailed reports is accurate throughout, and that\nscarcely one of them is accurate in even all the points of importance.\nI think it undesirable at present to publish the details of my\nmethods, but I have communicated them to Mrs. Sidgwick and Mr.\nHodgson. I have also communicated them to Mr. Angelo J. Lewis,\nknown under the name of Professor Hoffmann as the author of\nseveral books on conjuring and magic. Mr. Lewis sends me the\nfollowing statement:- .\nI have read with much interest the foregoing reports of sittings with Mr.\nDavey, testifying, as will be seen, to occurrences fully as striking and ap-\nparently abnormal as anything recorded as having taken place at sittings with\nMr. Eglinton. I have since had the opportunity of discussing the matter\nin detail with Mr. Davey, who has indicated how far the descriptions of the\nsitters (though given in all good faith) diff'er from the actual occurrencea,\nand has explained the various methods employed by him, some of such\nmethods being those in actual use by professional mediums in America and\nelsewhere, and others the outcome of his own ingenuity. I have been\nmuch struck wit.h their combined boldneBS and simplicity, and in view of\nthe complete illusion they admittedly have produced in so many cases, the\n\" doubt\" which I expressed in the JO'I.\/,rnal of the Society for Psychical\nResearch for ..dugt'Bt, 1886, as to the possibility of the 1ohole of the Eglinton\nmanifestations being produced by trickery, has been greatly shaken. Mr.\nDavey's successes prove that it is possible for a conjurer, devoting himself\nspecially to slate-writing feats, to produce, under the sam~extel\"l1l'l\nDigitized by ~qp8le\n\f486 The Po88ibilitw of MalrOb8e'MJation, t\/;c.\nconditions, result. of precieely the aame kind and quality .. thOle produced by\nthe profeued medium. Indeed, in 10 far .. the conditions vary at all, they are\ngreatly in favour I)f the profeeaional medium, firat, by ~n of the prestige\nderived from hiB claim to 8upernatural powers; and, aecondly, by ~n of\nhia cherished privilege of producing no results at all unleu he may\nconsider it perfectly .fe to do 10.\nI am not at liberty to divulge Mr. Davey'. method., nor would any goc.d\npurpoae be aerved by doing 10 ; but I willingly certify, for the benefit of\nany perlOn who may .till entertain a doubt upon the matter, that his\nU manUeatations\" are in every cue produced by perfectly natural means.\nno Spiritualiatic or other unknown force having any part in them.\nANOBLO J. LBWIII.\n(U Prof8llOr Hoffmann.\")\nEnough has been said, in the notes to the reports, to suggest to the\nreader how wide a margin must be allowed for the possibilities of\nmisdescription in the numerous records to be found in Spiritualistic\nliterature, of occurrences described in much the same manner as those\nwhich I produced by trickery. It seems to me not improbable that\nhad I claimed the agency of \"spirits,\" the effect upon many of my\nsitters would have been yet more impressive, and their reports\nwould have been still more wonderful. But my position debarred\nme from more than one advantage which has been used, I believe, by\nmany a trickster\" medium.\" I was unwilling, for instance, to trade\nupon their emotions by professing to give messages from dead relatives\n8Ild friends, as I might in many instances have done-thus rendering\nthe recipients of such messages less capable as observers of the\nphenomena, and more prejudiced in favour of their genuineness. I\nshould find it very difficult myself to draw any line as to the possi-\nbilities of mal\u00b7observation and lapse of memory in bln'6d.fok witnesses\nbeyond saying that I should allow for at leut as much as may be\nexemplified in the foregoing reports.\nI may here again remind my readers that it was not as a sceptic,\nbut as a believer in \"psychography,\" that I originally approached\nthis investigation as to the results that might be produced by conjuring.\nI gradually became convinced that my belief in \" psychography\"\nwas unjustified, that I could not attribute any value to the records of\nsittings which I had with a professional medium in 1884, without\nclaiming a superiority which undoubtedly does not exist, to the\nnumerous witnesses of my own phenomena.\nIn some of my earlier experiments I believed that there were\nindications of thought-transference between myself and my sitters.\nMy later sittings have offered no support to this view, but, owing\npartly to my inexperience, I laboured sometimes under considerable\nnervous excitement in my earlier sittings, and I have not felt this\nlatterly. This may have conduced to what occasionally seemed to me\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fExperimental Investigation. 487\nto be a certain a.mount of community of thought between my sitters\nand myself, and I hope' at some time to make a special series of\nexperiments for the purpose of ascertaining whether my conjecture\nis well founded or not.\nIn conclusion, I may say that the results of my investigation as to\nthe possibilities of conjuring in relation to \"psychography\" have been\na. revelation to myself no less than to others. I am aware that in\naddition to the methods which I have employed for producing\" slate-\nwriting,\" there are other methods, which I know to be conjuring, but\nwhich have not yet been shown to me; and I should certainly not be\nconvinced of the genuineness of Spiritualistic phenomena. of t1ris kind\nby any testimony such as I have seen recently published in great\nabundance, which presents so many close analogies to the reports of my\nown conjuring performances.\nAPPENDIX.\nNota to SrrnNG I.\nBy S.

Mrs. Y. does not mention that the alate was withdrawn more than\nonae and plaeed on the table, and she apparently did not observe what D.\ndid with the alate on these occasions in the act of plaeing it under the table\nagain, and before Mias Y., who relinquiahed hold when the alate was on the\ntable, again took hold of it.\nMrs. Y alao does not say what the questions were. One of them, asked\nby Mr. Y., was, \"On what day do we sail for America 7\" and another, asked\nby herself, was, \" Have I Kot over-shoes on 7\" It is noteworthy that lat~r a\nreply was obtained to this first question, which D. requested Mr. Y. to\nrepeat.\n2. It was, however, written in an ordinary way. It was not the caaethat\nneither Mr. D.'s hand nor Miss Y.'s moved in the least the whole time. Part\nof the conjuring operation took place while Mias Y. was holding the\nalate, and while the thumbs of D. and Miss Y. were both visible, but\nanotber part of tbe operation took place in the intervaJa when Miss Y. was\nnot holding the alate.\n3. Mrs. Y. might have added that tbree more candlea were burning on\ntbe mantel-piece, and a lamp turned to tbe full on an adjoining table.\n4. 1 incline to think that D. walked with Misa Y. close to the bookcase.\nand waved hiB hand, requesting Mias Y. to choose a book.\n[I did not remember this incident clearly when 1 made my note, my\nattention having been drawn elsewhere while. Mias Y. was making her\nselection. But I learn from Mr. Davey that I saw correctly. I remember\nthat after the writing had been produced, Mr. Y. asked Miss Y. if she had\ngone alone to the bookcase, and she replied that she had, and that Mr.\nDavey had remained by the table with his back towards her_ Hence,\nprobably, the agreement of the reports in the erroneous statement. I\nconjecture that Mias Y. transposed Mr. Davey's actions on the two separate\noccasions of her choice of a book. On the occasion of her first choice I\nbelieve Mr. Davey did remain close to the table as abe deacribea.]\n5. Miss Y. had thought of page 1, but no quotation had been given\nfrom this page.\n6. This statement is erroneous. Mrs. Y. had not the alate under her eye\nthe whole time, nor was it the case that either her daughter's hand or her\nown was placed upon it continuously.\n7. This atatement also is erroneous. The alates u.eed in the experimen'\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fEaperime'ntal I'nvestigation.. 489\nwere, indeed, thOle which Mr. Y. had brought with him, but they were\ntaken and placed together by Mr. Davey.\n8. Mrs. Yo's hand WaB removed from the slates during the experiment.\nD. After the figure had been drawn and the name of the colour written\nin the locked slate (away from the table, and out of the sight of D.) by Mr.\nand MiIIIl Y., Mr. Y. named the (\"oWur (only) aloud, at Mr. D.'s request.\n10. MiIIIl Y. doea not mention the previoUB withdrawa.la of the slate. See\nnote 2, and Mr. Y's. report [a].\n11. MiBII Y. henelf took the alate in her own hand with her to the\nbookcaae, and brought it back to the table, without relinquishing hold. She\nbaa thus here forgotten a precaution which she really took.\n12. MiIIIl Y.'sremembrance is here incorrect.\n13. MiBII Y. wrote her description of this from her recollection of the\nfigure seen on the alate the night before, and she stated, after looking at the\nslate, that she had jn memory confused the white and the so-called green\n(which in daylight is at once seeD to be bZue). The Zong mark WaB blue, the\nIlhorl one WaB white.\n14. I think that two out of the three books originally chosen had been\nprevUmaZy replaced, the one chOlen by Miss Y. being one of them.\n15. I chose mine by requesting Mr. Y. to take a number of chips of\npencil at random out of the box, which he did, the numben giving 7\nand D.\n16. Each wrote down on a slate the page and line he or she bad chosen,\nso that D. could not see it, and then placed the slate, writing downwards, on\nthe table under his or her own charge. The numbers chosen were not\nspoken aloud till after the final opening of the slate.\n17. The slate WaB not guarded continuously during the interval between\nthe examination and the final opening.\n18. I consider that the figure WaB a manifest attempt at a cross, three of\nthe limbs being clear, the fourth being only a scrawl. The marks forIDing\nthe .. cross \" were in blue and white j there WaB also a red track on the slate.\nID. I have heard Mr. Y.'s explanations, but with the very partial excep-\ntion of a portion of one of them they were incorrect, and I believe that\nthere WaB no thought-transference.\nThe reader should remember that the object of the notes to the various\nreports is not, of course, to supply all their deficiencies, or even to point out\nall the erron and omillllions noticed therein by Mr. Davey and myself. Some\nof those erron and omiBBions the reader may discover for himself by a com-\nparison of independent reports of the same Bitting. Let him compare, for\nexample, the three descriptions of [e] in Sitting IL, bearing in mind that Mr.\nY. knew all along that the perfonnances were conjuring, that MiBII Y. knew\nthis only just before writing her report, and that Mrs. Y. did not know it\nuntil her report had been written. I agreed with Mrs. Y. that BOme of the\nother chalka moved, besides the red piece, and that the figure produced on\nthe slate WaB clearly intended for a cross (and Mr. Davey af~rwards aBBUred\nme that he had intended to draw a crou), and I have no doubt that Mr. Y.'s\ndescription of the incident unduly diminiahPII the .. marvel\" of the phe-\nnomenon, just aB Mrs. Yo's unduly inCroaBOB it. . .

The alate was sometimes lying on the table,\nwith Mr. Legge's hand upon it; and he loat perception of iUora short period.\nnotwithstanding his vigilance.\n2. Mr. Davey took the slate and asked Mr. Legge to hold it under the\ntable with him. After a short time the alate was withdrawn by both of them\nat Mr. Davey's suggestion, but no writing was found upon it. When Mr.\nDavey, alone, took hold of the slate again to place it under the table, he\nused an opportunity, and Mr. Legge did not observe what was done. These\ncircumstances are omitted from Mr. Legge's report. The withdrawal which\nin his report appears to have been the first, was in reality the eecond.\n3. Mr. Legge did not act precisely as before. On the eecond and third\noccaaions on which the alate was placed under the table, Mr. Legge did Dot\ntake hold of it until after it had been placed there by Mr. Davey.\n4. Mr. Legge omits to notice that Mr. Davey had asked a question as to\nwhether any manifestations could be obtained.\n5. The alate was neither selected nor placed by Mr. Legge. Mr. Davey\nfirst placed some coloured nibs of chalk on the table just in front of Mr.\nLegge. He then took one of his own slates which Mr. Legge had not\ntouched, and apparently sponged both sides thoroughly. Mr. Davey himself\nthen placed the slate over the pieces of chalk, and asked Mr. Legge to place\nhis hand upon the slate. Mr. Legge then for the first time touched the slate.\n6. Mr. Legge has omitted to mention more than one important previoll&\ndetail concerning the locked alate. After locking it, he first, at Mr. Davey's\nrequest, put it in his pocket, also the key. Later on, he was requested by\nMr. Davey to bring it out and place it on the table and put his hand upon it.\nfirst opening it to see if any writing was in it, and locking it again, and\ntaking poaseBBion of the key. It lay on the table thus some time, and Mr.\nDavey found an opportunity of manipulating it. (See Note I.) Mr. Legge's\ngreat care over some precautions was the very cause of his neglect of others.\n7. In addition to the lamp, there were four candles burning the whole\ntime. Three of them were on the mantel-piece. I do not recollect whether\nthe fourth was on the mantel-piece or on one of the tables.\nNotes to SIrl'ING IV.\nBy RICHARD HODGSON.\n[From notes made September 22nd, 1886.]\nL The alates were both .f thElm Mr. Padshah's, but I cannot rocollect that;\neither of them was washed by any person, and I find upon inapection_\nthey are still in my possession-that they were certainly not washed.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fExperi;mental I nVe8tigatum. 491\n2. Mr. Padahah baa omitted to mention myself. I sa.t between Mr.\nRUBlell and Hughes.\n3. I do not myself remember. Mr. RU88ell states that it was washed by\nMr. Davey, and M1'8. RU88ell states that it was washed by Mr. Padahah\nhimself.\n4. I thought the selection at t.hat time had reference to the writing on\nthe alate held underneath the table.\n5. See note 15.\n6. Mr. Padahah does not sa.y that it was Mr. Davey who suggeated that\nwriting between the two alates should be asked for.\n7. The word rea.lly writ.ten, 88 I learn from Mr. Davey, was \"Books,\"\nand was thus curiously misread byMr. Padshah, who had, he tells us near the\nbeginning of his report, suggeated the importance of getting\" my own name\n-not surname-which no one except myself in the room knew.\" I believe\nthat no one in the room except Mr. Padahah knew that his initial name was\nRoorz'U, in the original Pe1'8ian. Mr. Davey had written \" Books\" in order\nto suggest the experiment with a book, which was afterwards carried out.\nMr. Padahah had apparently been much impressed with the idea of getting\nhis ti1'8t name written, and it is no matter for surprise that, with such a\ndominant idea, he should interpret a scrawly Books into a Boon. It was\njust Mr. Padshah's devotion to his test that produced the illusion.\n8. Not cracks, but a peculiar chip in the frame on one side, which I had\nobserved closely when Mr. Padahah fil'It showed me his slates.\n9. Mr. Padshah had not examined them.\n10. What Mr. Padahah describes as a \" push \"was merely the result of\nthe shaking of Mr. Davey's handa in his endeavour to produce the appearance\nof \" convulsive movements.\"\n11. None of Mr. Padshah's colleagues expreaaed any opinion as to the\nmanner of the production of the writing, and it was explained before the\naeance that the reports written should be as independent as pOBBible.\n12. Notwithstanding Mr. Padahah's confidence on this point, this\" con-\ntemptible \" theory is the true one; his attention WIlo8 actually diverted\nfrom the locked slate, and for some time he entirely lost perception of it\nalthough it was then lying on the table. His confidence on this point is a\nstriking illustration of the influence of temporary forgetfulneBB, which not\nimprobably would have become permanent had he not, after giving me his\nreport, made further efforts of recollection after I had told him that the\nalate-writing was due to conjuring. He wrote his report on the night ot the\nsitting, beginning shortly after the sitting was over. He gave me his report.\nas soon as he had finished it, and I then &BBured him that the alate-writing\nin every C8.1!e waa the result of conjuring, that the writing on the slate W88\nnot \" precipitated,\" but waa ordinary writing with a alate pencil, and that he\nhad actually lost sight of the slate during the sitting. He then Ilndeavoured\nagain to reca.ll the events of the sitting, and succeeded eventually in recol-\nlecting the particular oCC8.l!ion when an opportunity was given to Mr. Davey\nof dealing with the locked slate unobserved.\n[I did nf)t then inform Mr. Padahah whether he was right or not in this\nrecollect.ion, and his temporary forgetfulneBB 1uu become permanent.\nApparently he afterwards quite forgot the occaaion when he ga.ve Mr. Davey\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f492 The P088ibilitia of Mal-Obsermtion, tl;c.\nthe opportunity to produce the m~e, and he wrote to me on November\n21st, 1886: .. I now imagine Davey wrote while he Itudioualy directed my\nattention to a variety of books, and naturally abeebt-minded, my attention\nW81 abaorbed with a view to make a judicioUi selection, thUi withdrawing my\neye from the \"ate itself. Whether it is 10 or not, I think it is more thaD\npouible it might have been done that way.\" During this incident, however,\n-unfortunately for Mr. Davey-Mr. Padahah had taken the locked alate with\nhim and carefully guarded it; _ Mr. RUllell'1 report [g]. ]\n13. 1 leam from Mr. Padahah that he hu had sittings with Eglinton\nwhen \"phenomena .. occurred, that he W&l not convinced by them \"of lOme-\nthing abnormal,\" and that he wu much more impl'8lled by the sitting with\nHr.

Mr. RUIleU here Itltes that the \" Yea .. and the\" 6\" were found at\nthe ame time on the elate. My remembrance &I to this point is not vivid,\nbut it agreel with Mr. RulleD'l. From Mr. Padahah'l report it would appear\nthat there were ttoo withdrawals, the firat for the \"6,\" the I8CODd for the\n\u2022\u2022Yes.\" Mn.

[I have since\nlearnt that he did not see the word at all, 81 it W81 10 hutily wiped away\nby Mr. Davey.]\n17. I think that Mr. Davey turned the two elatea over together in the act\nof placing them on Mr. Padllhah'llIhoulder, not in the act of replacing them\non the table. [Mr. Davey ten. me that Mr. RUllell is right; Mr. Hughes\nagreed with me.]\n18\u2022 .BZI~. See Note 22.\n19. Mr. RUlieU made a very few brief notes during the litting, but did\nnot Ule these in writing hie report.\n20. There il a drawer at one end only of the table. Mrs. RUllell probably\ninferred that there wall a drawer at the other end, where, however, the table\nbaa never been fitted for a drawer. The table is perfectly honest, and the\ndrawer h81 never been ueed by Mr. Davey.\n21. It wall Mr. RUlleU who chose red, and Mrs. RUlleU adopted his\nchoice.\n22. There were chalks offive colours between the alatea, red, green, blue,\nyeUow, and white. The\" blue\" writing afterwards exhibited appeared in the\nthen light to be of a greenish tinge, and &I attention wall drawn to the writing'lI\nbeing green, Mr. Davey abstracted the blue piece of chalk that had been\nbetween the llates, probably 10 that if inv8ltigation of the chalb were made,\nit might be said that &I there 11'&1 no blue between the elates, green had been\nused.

HODGSON AND J. M. DODDS.\n1. I had lOme converaation with Mr. Dodds on the day after he finished\nhia report, and notwithstanding his close observation during the sitting, and\nthe great care which he had taken to record accurately the e\"ents which he\nbad witneBBed, he agreed with me concerning particular lapses of observation\nand memory, which have produced some errol'll in his report. That he did not\ndiacover Mr. Davey's mod\", opemtidi in producing the writing was due chiefly\nto mal-observation, but mal-observation of a kind that perhaps the keenest'\nuninitiated witneu would find it almost impossible to avoid. Mr. Dodds at\none time or another had lost perception of each slate upon which writing was\nproduced. One of the instances of lapse of memory is worth specifying\nbecause it illustrates tendencies to which I have previously adverted,-the\ntendency to minimise the marvel of a phenomenon known to be due to\nconjuring, and, poBBibly, the tendenoy to represent a subsequent impreBBion\nas having been experienced during the Bitting.\nThe word Yu found written upon the slate 11'&8 the word desired by Mr.\nDodds himself, his question on the double-slate having been given up for the\ntime for the expreBB purpose of obtaining some simple phenomenon which\n11'&8 not to be regarded &8 a test, but merely &8 a \"start.\" Mr. Davey had\nsuggested that we should try to get some simple word written such &8 00 or\nyu, that if writing once began, 'we should probably\" get plenty of it,\" and\ntest questions could be attempted later. Mr. Dpdds aBBented to this. Hence\nneither Mr. Davey nor myself expected Mr. Dodds to be specially influenced\nby the production of the word, though he appeared to be much more\nimpreBBed in the. fil'llt instance than he afterwards, when writing his report,\nsupposed himself to have been.-R. H.\nOn ta1king over the sitting with Mr. Hodgson, two days afterwards,\nI agreed with him that in my account of the production of the word \"Yes,\"\nmy memory played me false, and I unconsciously minimised the result; and\nthat his account given above is the correct one.-J.

At this stage, had Mr. Davey been a profeBBiona.1 medium, he would\nperhaps have expressed surprise at the prematurely discovered writing, and\npassed it off &8 an unexpected production of the \"spirits,\" remarking that\nthe lOund of the writing W&8 not always heard by the Bittel'll, and that oven\nthe medium himself could not always tell when it 11'&8 being ptQd.uced. lIt\nDigitized by ~008 e\n\f40940 The P088ibilities 0\/ Mal-Observation, ~c.\nwould have been difficult for Mr. Dodds to have explained. how, under the\nconditiona .. deacribed by him, the writing, covering a aide of one of hia own\nslates, could by any pouibility have been produced by Mr. Davey himaelf.\nR.

According to my recollection, Mr. Davey uaed both handa in placing\nthe tiates under t.he table, and again in the course of replacing them upon the\ntable, but his left hand did not remain below the table in any instance for a\nlonger interval than-I should name .. a maximum limit-ten aeconcia.\n2. The word \"Commandment\" end. at. the edge of the alate, but it begins\nvery nearly at the centre of the slate, and is written almOit parallel with the\nlonger axil of the slate, traversing rather more than half the length of the\nslate surface. The BCrawled words\" SeventY-Beven\" are written diagonally,\nvery nearly acroll the centre of the alate, and the number 77 is in a aimilar\nposition on the other side of the centre. The writing intended for Hong-\nKong is in a position IOmewhat to the right of the centre. The slatea are\nstill in my po.._ion.\nNota to SlTl'lNO XV.\nBy Ma. SIOOWICK.\n1. According to my independent notu (made Nov. 17th, 1885), the\nlocked slate 11'&1 at this period examined and 11'&1 blank.\n2. According to my noteB \"this moment\" 11'&1 of sufficient duration to\ngive plenty of time and opportunity to write the meuage.\n3. I infer from my noteB and recollection that no examination of the alate\n11''' made at thiB period, for I had in my mind at t.he time two pouible 8X-\nplanations of t.he trick, and any Buch examination would have been incom-\npatible with either. Moreover, Mr. Davey UBurea me that from the way in\nwhich the trick actually 11'&1 done he knows that the alate cannot have been\nexamined at this point.

According to my notes (made Feb. 23rd. 1886), Mr. Davey had ODe\nround-cornered alate among hiB, though I noticed, &I I thought, decided\ndiJrerences between it and Miaa Symons'. This is worth mentioning, &I\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fEaperilrnental I'I\/,vestigatio'n. 495\nshowing a dift\"erence of opinion on a point which we both thought we observed\nparticularly. Beaidea omissions, there are at least two important positive\nmiadeacriptions, which I am not at liberty to specify further, in Mias\nSymons' account of the first incident of the Hance. I well remember\nthe impreBBion which this incident made on me at the time. I could\nnot make it out at all. I believe I thought it more puzzling than any\nprofessed Spiritualistic phenomena I have seen, &BIuming theae latter to\nbe conjuring. There seemed leas possibility of its having been done by con-\njuring. The hypotheaia of the change of slates, which at first did not seem\nto be pouible---and which wu, in fact, as Mr. Davey &SImes me, erroneous-\nnever seemed plausible; only I was unable to think of any other explanation\nat all. The reason it puzzled me so much was that. I thought I knew pretty\nwell the poBBibilitiea of slate.writing, and there seemed to be no loop-hole\nhere for any of them. It may interest the reader to compare my own\naccount of the incident :-\n\" Miu Symons' two slates were held together on the table and under the\ntable by her and Mr. Davey. Then one of Mr. Davey's square-cornered\nBlatea was substituted for one of them; then again removed and the two\nround-cornered ones again held, on the ground that though it might be easier\nto get writing on Mr. Davey's slate, it would be more satisfactory to get it on\nMiBB iymons'. We waited a considerable time. Mr. Davey asked me to\ndraw the curtains between the two rooms. Then we again sat as before; the\ntwo slates on one another on the table and our handa on them. The sound of\nwriting was heard, and. presently, on looking between the two alatea, one of\nthem was found to be written on all over one side. I cannot remember every\ndetail of what occurred, but the impreuion produced on my mind moat dia-\ntinctly was that one of MiBB Symons' slates had been written on all over one\naide [the impreBBion was so far true], and that there had been no poBBible\nopportunity for Mr. Davey to have done thia. The slate seemed to have\nbeen on the table with our handa on it from the moment we had seen it\nclean. I do not know what happened while I drew the curtain, but cannot\nconceive its having been done then. Mr. Davey and Mias Symons still sat\nat the table, and even if there had been opportunity there was no time.\"\n2. According to my notes it was for the first of the three book experi-\nments that the paper and lead pencil were used, and Mr. Davey agreed with\nme. The paperwas S.P.R. paper, and Mr. Davey tore off a comer forfurther\nidentification.\n3. \"Another trick\" was Mr. Davey's own expression.\n4.

My theme 18 the multiplex and mutable character of that\nwhich we know a.s the Personality of man, and the practical advantage\nwhich we may gain by discerning and working upon this a.s yet\nunrecognised modifiability. I shall begin by citing a few examples of\nhysterical transfer, of morbid disintegration; I shall then show that\nthese spontaneous readjustments of man's being are not all of them\npathological or retrogressive j nay, that the familiar changes of slAep\nand waking contain the hint of further alternations which may be\nbeneficially acquired. And, la.stly, I shall point out that we can\nalready by artificial means induce and regulate some central nervous\nchanges which effect physical and moral good j changes which may be\nmore restorative than s}eep, more rapid than education. Here, I shall\nurge, is an avenue open at once to scientific and to philanthropic\nendeavour, a hope which hangs neither on fable nor on fancy, but is\nba.sed on actual experience and consists with rational conceptions of\nthe genesis and evolution of man.\nI begin, then, with one or two examples of the pitch to which the\ndissociation of memories, faculties, sensibilities may be ca.tried, without\nresulting in mere insane chaos, mere demented oblivion. These ca.ses\na.s yet are few in number. It is only of late yea.rs-and it is mainly\nin France-that BfWMIt& have recorded with due care those psychical\nlessons, deeper than any art of our own can teach us, which natural\nanomalies and aberrant instances afford.\nPre-eminent among the priceless living documents which Dature\nthus offers to our study stand the singular personages known as\nLouis V. and Felida X. Felids's name at least is probably familiar to\nmost of my readers; but Louis V.'s case is little known, and although\nsome a.ccount of it has already been given in English,l it will be\n1 JoumaJ. of Mmtal ScilmC6 for Juuary, 1886.\n8. P. R., Part X., 1886.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fMultiplex Per8onality. 497\nneedful to recall certa.in particulars in order to introduce the specula-\ntions which follow.\nLouis V. began life (in 1863) as the neglected child of a\nturbulent mother. He was sent to a reformatory a.t ten years old,\nand there showed himself, as he has always done when his organisa-\ntion has given him a chance, quiet, well-behaved, and obedient.\nThen at fourteen years old he had a great fright from a viper-a\nfright which threw him off his balance and started the series of\npsychical oscillations on which he has been tossed ever since. At\ntirst the symptoms were only physical, epilepsy and hysterical paralysis\nof the legs; and at the asylum of Bonneval, whither he was next\nsent, he worked at tailoring steadily for a couple of months. Then\nsuddenly he had a hystero-epileptic attack-fifty hours of convulsions\nand ecstasy--and when he awoke from it he was no longer paralysed,\nno longer acquainted with tailoring, and no longer virtuous. His\nmemory was set back, so to say, to the moment of the viper's appear-\nance, and he could remember nothing since. His character had\nbecome violent, greedy, and quarrelsome, and his tastes were radically\nchanged. For instance, though he had before the attack been a\ntotal abstainer, he now not only drank his own wine but stole the\nwine of the other patients. He escaped from Bonneval, and after a\nfew turbulent years\" tracked by his occasional relapses into hospital\nor madhouse, he turned up once more at the Rochefort asylum in\nthe character of a private of marines, convicted of theft but con-\nsidered to be of unsound mind. And at Rochefort and La. Rochelle,\nby great good fortune, he fell into the hands of three physicians-\nProfessors Bourru and Burot, and Dr. Mabille-able and willing to\ncontinue and extend the observations which Dr. Camuset at Bonneval\nand Dr. Jules Voisin at Bic41tre had already made on this most\nprecious of mauvais BUje\" at earlier points in his chequered career'!\nHe is now no longer at Rochetort, and Dr. Burot informs me that\nhis health has much improved, and that his peculiarities have in\ngreat part disappeared. I must, however, for clearness' sake, use the\npresent tense in briefly describing his condition at the time when\nthe long series of experiments were made.\nThe state into which he has gravitated is a very unpleasing one.\nThere is paralysis and insensibility of the right side, and (as is often\nthe case in right hemiplegia) the speech is indistinct and difficult.\n1 For Dr. Camnset's account see AnnaluMUico.Pyschologiquu, 18R2, p.75;\nfor Dr. Voisin's, Archi\"u de NlWTOlogie, September, 1885. The observations at\nRochefort have been carefully recorded by Dr. Berjon, La Grande HlI,th'ie chez\nI'Homme, Paris, 1886, and by Drs. Bourru and Burot in a treatise, De la 1I1I!J-\ngutUm mentale. &c. (Bibl. acientVique contempoNJi1l6). Paris, 1887\nC I\nDigitized by oog e\n\f498\nNevertheless he is constantly haranguing anyone who will listen to\nhim, abusing his physicians, or preaching, with a monkey-like impu-\ndence rather than with reasoned clearness, radicalism in politica and\natheism in religion. He makes bad jokes, and if anyone pleaSes\nhim he endeavours to caress him. He remembers recent events\nduring his residence at the Rochefort asylum, but only two scraps of\nhis life before that date-namely, his vicious period at Bonneval and\na part of his stay at Bicatre.\nExcept this strangely fragmentary memory there is nothing very\nunusual in this condition, and in many asylums no experiments on it\nwou1d have betan attempted. Fortunately the physicians of R0che-\nfort were familiar with the efficacy of the contact of metals in\nprovoking transfer of hysterical hemiplegia from one side to the\nother. They tried various metals in turn on Louis V. Lead, silver.\nand zinc had no effect. Copper produced a slight return of sensi-\nbility in the paralysed arm. But Bteel, applied to the right arm,\ntransferred the whole insensibility to the left side of the body.\nInexplicable aa Buch a phenomenon certainly is, it is aufficiently\ncommon (as French physicians hold) in hysterical cases to excite\nlittle surprise. What puzzled the doctors was the change of\ncharacter which accompanied the change of aensibility. When\nLouis V. issued from the crisis of transfer, with its minute of\nanxious expression and panting breath, he was what might fairly be\ncalled a new man. The restless insolence, the savage impulsiveneas,\nhave wholly disappeared. The patient is now gentle, respectful, and\nmodest. He can speak clearly now, but he only apeaka when he is\nspoken to. If he is aaked his views on religion and politica, he\nprefers to leave Buch matters to wiaer heads than his own. It might\nseem that morally and intellectually the patient'B cure had been\ncomplete.\nBut now ask him what he thinks of Rochefort; how he liked his\nregiment of marines. He will blankly answer that he knows nothing\nof Rochefort, and was never a soldier in his life. \"Where are you,\nthen, and what is the date of to-day1\" \"I am at Bicetre; it is\nJanuary 2nd, 1884; and I hope to see M. Voisin to-day, aa I did\nyesterday.\"\nIt is found, in fact, that he has now the memory of two short periods\nof life (different from thoae which he remembers when his right side\nis paralysed), periods during which, so far aa can now be ascertained,\nhis character waa of thia same decorous type and his paralysis was OD\nthe left side.\nTheae two conditions are what are now termed his first and his\nsecond, out of a aeries of six or more through which he can be made\nto pass. For brevitY'B sake I will further describe his fifth state only.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fMultip~ Per8onality. 499\nIf he is placed in an electric bath, or if a magnet be placed on\nhis head, it looks at first sight as though a complete physical cure had\nbeen effected. All paralysis, all defect of sensibility, has disappeared.\nHiiI movements are light and active, his expression gentle and timid.\nEut ask him where he is, and you find that he has gone back to a boy\nelf fourteen, that he is at St. Urbain, his first reformatory, and that his\nmemory embraces his years of childhood, and stops short on the very day\nwhen he had the fright with the viper. If he is pressed to recollect the\nincident of the viper a violent epileptiform crisis puts a sudden end to\nthis phase of his personality.\nIs there, then, the reader may ask, any assignable law which\ngoverns these strange revolutions 1 any reason why Louis V. should at\none moment seem a mere lunatic or savage, at another moment should\nrise into decorous manhood, at another should recover his physical\nsoundness, but sink backward in mind into the child1 Briefly,and\nwith many reserves and technicalities perforce omitted, the view of the\ndoctors who have watched him is somewhat as follows: A sudden\nshock, falling on an unstable organisation, has effected in this boy a\nprofounder severance between the functions of the right and left hemi-\nspheres of the brain than has perhaps ever been observed before. We\nare accustomed, of course, to see the right side of the body paralysed\nand insensible in cOnsequence of injury to the left hemisphere, which\ngoverns it, and vice versa. And we are accustomed in hysterical cases\n-cases where there is no actual traceable injury to either hemisphere\n-to see the defects in sensation and motility shift rapidly-shift, as I\nmay say, at a touch-from one side of the body to the other. But we\ncannot usually trace any corresponding change in the mode of\nfunctioning of what we assume as the \"highest centres,\" the centres\nwhich determine those manifestations of intelligence, character,\nmemory, on which our identity mainly depends. Yet in some cases of\napluuria and of other forms of asemia (the loss of power over Big'IUI,\nspoken or written words and the like) phenomena have occurred which\nhave somewhat prepared us to find that the loss of power to use the\nleft-which certainly is in some ways the more developed-hemisphere\nmay bring with it a retrogression in the higher characteristics of\nhuman life. And the singular phenomenon of automatic writing (as I\nhave previously tried to showl ) seems often to depend on an obscure\naction of the less-used hemisphere. Those who have followed these\nlines of observation may be somewhat prepared to think it possible\nthat in Louis V.'s case the alternate predominance of right or left\nhemisphere affects memory and character as well as motor and sensory\ninnervation. Inhibit his left brain (and right side) and he becomes,\n1 Procuding80\/ the S.P.R., VoL III. .. G I\nDigitized by oog e\n\f500 Multiplu Per80'Mlity.\n.. one may say, not only left-handed but ..,,\"Wi'..he manifests himself\nthrough nervous arrangements which have reached a lower degree of\nevolution. And he can represent in memory those periods only when\nhis personality had assumed the same attitude, when he had crystallised\nabout the same point.\nInhibit his right brain, and the higher qualities of character\nremain, like the power of speech, intact. There is self~ntrol; there\nis modesty; there is the sense of duty-the qualities which man bas\ndeveloped .. he has risen from the savage level. But nevertheless he\nis only half himself. Besides the hemiplegia, which is a matter of\ncourse, memory is truncated too, and he can summon up only such\nfragments of the past as chance to have been linked with this one\nabnormal &taw, leaving unrecalled not only the period of sinister\ninward ascendency, but the normal period of childhood, before his\nWuen was thus cloven in twain. And now if by some art we can\nrestore the equipoise of the two hemispheres again, if we can throw\nhim into a state in which no physical trace is left of the severance\nwhich has become for him a second nature, what may we expect to find\nas the psychical concomitant of this restored integrity' What we do\nfind is a change in the patient which, in the glimpse of psychical\npossibilities which it offers us, is among the most interesting of all.\nHe is, if I may so say, born again; he becomes .. a little child; he\nis set back in memory, character, knowledge, powers, to the days\nbefore this trouble came upon him or his worse self assumed its\naway.\nI have begun with the description of an extreme case, a case which\nto many of my readers may seem incredible in its bi~. But\nthough it is extreme it is not really isolated; it is approached from\ndifferent sides by cases already known. The mere resumption of life\nat an earlier moment, for instance, is of course only an exaggeration of\na phenomenon which frequently appears after cerebral injury. The\ntrainer, stunned by the kick of a horse, completes his order to loosen\nthe girths the moment that trepanning has been successfully performed.\nThe old lady struck down at a card party, and restored to consciousness\nafter long insensibility, surprises her weeping family by the inquiry,\n\" What are trumps 7\" But in these common cases there is but a\nmorsel cut out of life; the personality reawakens as from sleep and\nis the same as of old. With Louis V. it is not thus; the memories\nof the successive stages are not lost but juxtaposed, .. it were,\nin separate compartments; nor can one say what epochs are in truth\nintercalary, or in what central chann\"l the stream of his being\nflows.\nSelf-severances profound .. Louis V.'s are naturally to be sought\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f501\nDlainly in the lunatic asylum.l There indeed we find duplicated\nindividuality in its grotesquer forms. We have the man who has\nalways lost himself and insists on looking for himself under the bed.\nWe have the man who maintains that there are two of him, and sends\nhis plate a second time, remarking, \"I have had plenty, but the other\nfellow has not.\" We have the man who maintains that he is himself\nand his brother too, and when asked how he can possibly be both at\nonce, replies, \"Oh, by a different mother.\"\nOr sometimes the personality oscillates from one focus to another,\nand the rival impulses, which in us merely sway different moods,\nobjectify themselves each in a per80na. of its own. An hysterical\npenitent believes herself one week to be \"Sceur Marthe des Cinq\nPlaies,\" and the next week relapses into an imaginary \"Madame Poul-\nmaire,\" with tastes recalling a quite other than conventual model.\nAnother patient seems usually sane enough, but at intervals he lets his\nbeard grow, and is transformed into a swaggering lieutenant of\nartillery. The excess over, he shaves his beard and becomes once more\na lucid though melancholy student of the early Fathers. Such changes\nof character, indeed, may be rapid and varied to any extent which the\npatient's experience of life will allow. In one well-known case a poor\nlady varied her history, her character, even her sex, from day to day.\nOne day she would be an emperor's bride, the next an imprisoned\nstatesman-\nJuvenis qnondam, nunc femina, Creneus,\nR1U'II118 et in veterem fato revolnta fignram.\nYet more instructive, though often sadder still, are the cases where\nthe disintegration of personality has not reached the pitch of insanity,\nbut has ended in a bewildered impotence, in the horror of a lifelong\ndream. Speaking generally, such cases fall under two main heads--\nthose where the loss of control is mainly over motor centres, and the\npatient can feel but canno~ act ; and those where the loss of control is\nmainly over 86'11.801''!1 centres, and the patient acts but cannot feel.\nInability to act just as we would wish to act is a trouble in which\nwe most of us share. We probably have moods in which we can even\nsympathise with that provoking patient of Esquirol's who, after an\nattack of monomania, recovered all those social gifts which made him\nthe delight of his friends, but could no longer be induced to give five\nminutes' attention to the most urgent business. \" Your advice,\" he said\ncordially to Esquirol, \" is thoroughly good. I should ask nothing better\nthan to follow it, if you could further oblige me with the power to will\n1 The ca.see cited here come mainly from Kriahaber'a NMmJpa.t\/&\" C~,.tbro\u00b7\ncardiaque.

Billod's spent nearly an\nhour in attempting to make the flourish under his signature to a\npower of attorney ; or tried in vain for three hours, with hat and gloves\non, to leave his room and go out to a pageant which he much wished to\nBee. Such cases need heroic treatment, and this gentleman had the\nluck to be caught and cured by the Revolution of 1848.\nStill more mournful are the cases where it is mainly the sensory\ncentres which lie, as it were, outside the personality; where thought\nand will remain intact, but the world around no longer stirs the wonted\nfeelings, nor can reach the solitary BOUL \"In all my acts one thing is\nlacking-the sense of eBort that should accompany them, the sense of\npleasure that they should yield.\" \"All things,\" said another sufferer,\n\"are immeasurably distant from me ; they are covered with a heavy\nair.\" \"Men seem to move round me,\" said another, \"like mo\\ing\nshadows.\" And gradually this sense of ghostly vacancy extends to the\npatient's own person. \"Each of my senses, each part of me, is separate ,\nfrom myself.\" \"J'existe, mais en dehors de III. vie reelle.\" It is as\nthough Teiresias, who alone kept his true life in unsubstantial Hades,\nshould at last feel himself dream into a shade.\nSometimes the regretful longing turns into a bitter sense of exile,\nof banishment, of fall from high estate. There are words that remind\nus of the passionate protestations of Empedocles, refusing to accept\nthis earth as his veritable home. KAaiicrd .,., lCallCo.lCVCTa, said the Sicilian\nof Sicily, zacll. cUrv.,q8,a Xo.po.

J'avais un ardent desir\nde revoir mon ancien monde, de redevenir l'ancien moi; c'eat ce desir\nqui m'a emp~che de me tuer.\"\nThese instances have shown us the retrogrtlBftw change of per-\nsonality, the dissolution into inco-ordinate elements of the polity of our\nbeing. We have seen the state of man like a city blockaded, like a\ngreat empire dying at the core. And of course a spontaneous, ungtAided\ndisturbance in a machinery 80 complex is likely to alter it more often\nfor the worse than for the better. Yet here we reach the very point\nwhich I most desire to urge in this paper. I mean that even these\nspontaneous, these unguided disturbances, do sometimes effect a change\nwhich is a marked improvement. Apart from all direct experiment\nthey show us that we are in fact capable of being reconstituted after an\nimproved pattern, that we may be fused and recrystallised into greater\ndarity ; or, let us say more modestly, that the shifting sand-heap of our\nbeing will sometimes suddenly settle itself into a new attitude of more\nassured equilibrium.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fMultip~ Per8onality. 503\nAmong cases of this kind which have thus far been recorded, none\nis more striking than that of Dr. Amm's often quoted patient,\nFtilida X.l\nMany of my readers will remember that in her case the somnam-\nbullc life has become the normal life; the \"second state,\" which\nappeared at first only in short, dream-like accesses, has gradually\nreplaced the\" first state,\" which now recurs but for a few hours at long\nintervals. But the point on which I wish to dwell is this: that\nFelida's second state is altogether superio'T' to the first-physically\nsuperior, since the nervous pains which had troubled her from child-\nhood have disappeared ; and morally superior, inasmuch as her morose,\nself-centred disposition is exchanged for a cheerful activity which\nenables her to attend to her children and her shop much more effec-\ntively than when she was in the\" etat Mte,\" as she now calls what was\nonce the only personality that she knew. In this case, then, which is\nnow of nearly 30 years' standing, the spontaneous readjustment of\nnervous activities-the second state, no memory of which remains in\nthe first state-has resulted in an improvement profounder than could\nhave been anticipated from any moral or medical treatment that we\nknow. The case shows us how often the word \" normal \" means nothing\nmore than\" what happens to exist.\" For Ftilida's normal state was in\nfact her mo'T'bid state; and the new condition, which seemed at first a\nmere hysterical abnormality, has brought her to a life of bodily and\nmental sanity which makes her fully the equal of average women of her\nclass.\nNow, before we go further, let us ask ourselves whether this result,\nwhich sounds so odd and paradoxical, ought in reality to surprise us.\nHad we any reason for supposing that changes as profound as Felida's\nneed alwo.ys be for I;he worse, that the phase of personality in which\nwe happen to find ourselves is the phase in which, given our innate\ncapacities, it is always best for us to be 1\nTo make this question more intelligible, I must have recourse to\na metaphor. Let us picture the human brain as a vast manufactory,\nin which thousands of looms, of complex and differing patterns, are\nhabitually at work. These looms are used in varying combinations;\nbut the main driving-bands, which connect them severally or collectively\nwith the motive power, remain for the most part unaltered.\nNow, how do I come to have my looms and driving-gear arranged\nin this particular way 1 Not, certainly, through any deliberate choice\nof my own. My ancestor the ascldian, in fact, inherited the business\nwhen it consisted of little more than a single spindle. Since his day\n1 For the fullest account of Felids., Bee Hypnotisme, Dou.ble Co7l8Ciena, &c.,\npar Ie Dr. Azam. Paris, 1887.\nDigitized by GQqgle\n\fMultiplex Per8onality,\nmy nearer ancestors have added loom after loom. Some of their looms\nhave fallen to pieces unheeded j others have been kept in repair because\nthey suited the style of order which the firm had at that time to meet.\nBut the class of orders received has changed very rapidly during the\nlast few hundred years. I have now to try to turn out altruistic\nemotions and intelligent reasoning with machinery adapted to self-\npreserving fierceness or manual toil. And in my efforts to readjust and\nreorganise I am hindered not only by the old-fashioned type of the\nlooms, but by the inconvenient disposition of the driving-gear. I\ncannot start one useful loom without starting a dozen others that are\nmerely in the way. And I cannot shift the driving-gea.r to suit myself,\nfor I cannot get at much of it without stopping the engines, and if I\nstopped my engines I should not know how to set them going again.\nIn this perplexity I watch what happens in certain factories-FtUida's,\nfor instance-where the hidden part of the machinery is subject to\ncertain dangerous jerks or dislocations, after which the gearings shift\nof themselves and whole groups of looms are connected and disconnected\nin a novel manner. From hence I get at least a hint as to the concealed\nattachments; and if I see that new arrangement working well I have\nan object to aim at; I can try to produce a similar change, though a\nsmaller one, among my own looms and by my own manipulation.\nFor even if these profoundest spontaneous changes are beyond the\nreach of imitation, there are smaller changes, long familiar to us, which\nwe now see in a new light, as imitable in a manner which shall\nreproduce their advantages without their drawbacks. There is the\npainless trance which sometimes supervenes in hysteria; there is the\naction of alcohol; there is especially the action of opium, which from\nthe first commended itself by its psychical effect, by the emotional\ntranquillity which it induces. Such at least seems to be the inference\nfrom the well-known passage where the wifely Helen determines to\ngive her husband and his friends the chance of talking comfortably,\nwithout interrupting themselves by perpetual tears and lamentations.\nThon heaven-born Helen in their cups would throw\nNeponthes, woeless banisher of woe:\nThis whoso drank daylong no tear should shed-\nNo, though he gazed on sire aBd mother dead ;\nNo, though his own son on that. dreamy day\nBefore his own eyes raging foes should slay.1\nThe successive discoveries of intoxicants, narcotics proper, and\nanlllSthetics formed three important stages in our growing control over\nthe nervous system. Mesmer's discovery, or rather his rediscovery of a\nprocess probably at least as old as Solon, marked an epoch of quite\n1 Od. iv. 219.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fMultiplex Per8onality. 5Q5\nequal significance. And the refinements on Mesmer's process which\nthis century has seen, the discoveries linked with the names of\nPuys~gur, Esdaile, Braid, Charcot, &c., though often set forth with an\nair of controversy rather than of co-operation, will gradually be\nrecognised as mutually concordant elements in a new branch of moral\nas well as physical therapeutics. Nay, it is a nascent art of self-\nmodification; a system of pulleys (to return to our previous metaphor),\nby which we can disjoin and reconnect portions of our machinery which\nadmit of no directer access;\nOne or two brief instances may indicate the moral and the physical\nbenefits which hypnotisation is bringing within the range of practical\nmedicine. And first 1 will cite one of the cases-rare as yet-where\nan insane person has been hypnotised with permanent benefit.1\nIn the summer of 1884: there was at the Sal~triere a young\nwoman of a deplorable type. Jeanne Sch-- '\\fas a criminal lunatic,\nfilthy in habits, violent in demeanour, and with a lifelong history of\nimpurity and theft. M. Auguste Voisin, one of the physicians on\nthe staff, undertook to hypnotise her on May 31st, at a time when she\ncould only be kept quiet by the strait jacket and\" bonnet d'irrigation,\"\nor perpetual cold douche to the head. She would not-indeed, she\ncould not-look steadily at the operator, but raved and spat at him.\nM. Voisin kept his face close to hers, and followed her eyes wherever\nshe moved them. In about 10 minutes a stertorous sleep ensued; and\nin five minutes more she passed into a sleep-waking state, and began to\ntaik incoherently. The process was repeated on many days, and\ngradually she became sane when in the trance, though she still raved\nwhen awake. Gradually, too, she became able to obey in waking\nhours commands impressed on her in the trance-first trivial orders (to\nsweep the room and so forth), then orders involving a marked change\nof behaviour. Nay more; in the hypnotic state she voluntarily\nexpressed repentance for her past life, made a confession which\ninvolved more evil than the police were cognisant of (though it agreed\nwith facts otherwise known), and finally of her own impulse made good\nresolves for the future. Two years have now elapsed, and M. Voisin\nwrites to me (July 31st, 1886) that she is now a nurse in a Paris\nhospital, and that her conduct is irreproacha.ble. In this case, and in\nsome recent cases of M. Voisin's, there may, of course, be matter for\ncontroversy as to the precise nature and the prognosis, apart from\nhypnotism, of the insanity which was cured. But my point is amply\nmade out by the fact that this poor woman, whost!l history since the\n1 Annalu MbJico-P81JcJw1ogiguu, 1884, vol. ii., p. 289 ItJg.

Voisin has followed up this case with others equally striking,\ninto some of which a committee of the Soci~ttS Medico-Psychologique is\nnow inquiring.1 And M. Dufour, the medical head of another asylum,!\nhas adopted hypnotic suggestion as a regular element in his treatment.\n\"Des a present,\" he says, \"notre opinion est faite: sans crainte de\nnous tromper, nous affirmons que l'hypnotisme peut rendre service dans\nIe traitement des maladies mentales.\" As was to be expected, he finds\nthat only a small proportion of lunatics are hypnotisable i but the\neffect produced on these, whether by entrancement or suggestion, is\nuniformly good. His best subject is a depraved young man, who after\nmany convictions for crimes (including attempted murder) has become\na violent lunatic. \"T.,\" says Dr. Dufour, \"a ettS un 8.8II8Z mauvais\nsujet. NOUB n'avons plus aparler au present, tellement sea sentiments\nmoraux ont ~ttS am~ior~ par l'hypnotisme.\" This change and\namelioration of character (over and above the simple recovery of\nsanity) bas been a marked feature in some of Dr. Voisin's cases\nas well.\nThere is, indeed, in the sleep-waking state even of sane persons,\na characteristic change of character, more easily recognised than\ndescribed. Without generalising too confidently, I may say that there\nseems usually to be an absence of self-consciousness and anxiety, a\ndiminution of mere animal instincts, and a sense of expansion and\nfreedom which shows itself either in gaiety or in a sort of beatific\ncalm. In Madame B. (a subject whose susceptibility to hypnotisation\nby Dr. Gibert and Prof. Janet from a distance has recently attr\"Cted.\nmuch notice) there was something-as it seemed to me--indescribably\nabsurd in the contrast between the peasant woman's humble, stolid,\nresigned cut of countenance and the childish glee with which she\njoked and babbled during the \" phB86 somnambulique\" of her complex\ntrance. On the other hand M. Richet says of a recent subject of his\nown,s \"She seems when in the somnambulic state to be normal\nin all respects except that her character has changed. When awake\n1 I have myself seen Dr. Voisin BUccetI8fully hypnotise a melancholic\npatient who was in 8. state of extreme-it might have seemed of hopelese-\nreatl_ness.\nI Dr. E.

It is an indication that we may get more work out of\nourselves in certain modified states than we can at present. \"Ecstacy,'\n'Which in former ages was deemed the exalted prerogative of saints,\nis now described as a matter of course among the phases of a mere\nhysterical attack. The truth is, perhaps, more complex than either\nof these views would admit. Ecstasy (we may certainly say with\nthe modern alienist) is for the most part at least a purely subjective\naffection, corresponding to no reality outside the patient, and appearing\nalong with other instabilities in the course of hysteria. True; but on\nthe other hand ecstll.By is to hysteria somewhat as genius is to insanity.\nThe ecstasy, say, of Louise Latea.u assuredly proves no dogma, and\ncommunicates to us no revelation. Yet, taken strictly by itself, it is\nnot altogether a retrograde or dissolutive nervous phenomenon. Rather\nit represents the extreme tension of the poor girl's spirit in the highest\ndirection which her intellect allows; and the real drawback is that\nthis degree of occasional concentration usually implies great habitual\ninstability. The hysterical patient has an hour of ecstasy, during\nwhich her face, if we may trust Dr. Paul Richer's drawings,loften\nassumes a lofty purity of expression which the ordinary young person\nmight try in vain to rival. But she pays for the transitory exaltation\nby days of incoherent scolding, of reckless caprice. And similarly, as\nI maintain, the power of exaltation, of concentration, which constitutes\ngenius implies a profound modifialJility of the nervous system, a\ntendency of the stream of mentation to pour with a rush into some\nspecial channels. In a Newton or a Shelley this modifiability is\nadequately under control; were. it not so, our Shelleys would lapse\ninto incoherence, our Newtons into monomania.\nAnd I maintain that the hypnotic trance, with its liberation from\npetty preoccupations, its concentration in favourite channels, has\nsome analogy to genius as well as to hysteria. I maintain that for\nsome uneducated subjects it has been the highest mental condition\nwhich they have ever entered; and that, when better understood and\napplied to subjects of higher type, it may dispose to flows of thought\nmore undisturbed and steady t.han can be maintained by the waking\neffort of our tossed and fragmentary days.\nI have dwelt at some length on the moral accompaniments of\nthe hypnotic trance, because they are as yet much less generally\nknown than the physical. It would, indeed, be a mere waste of\n1 La Grande HylttrU, Second Edition, Pari'3, 1885.\nDigi\n\fspace to dwell on the lulling of pain which can be procured by\nthese methods, or even on the painl811 performanoe of surgical opera-\ntions during the hypnotic trance; but I will cite a C&I8 I illustrating\na point comparatively new-namely, that the insullCeptibility to pain\nneed not be confined to the entranced condition, but may be prolonged\nby hypnotic suggestion into subsequent waking hODrl.\nAn hysterical patient in the hospital of Bordeaux suffered recently\nfrom a malady which W8.1 certainly not imaginary. She had a\nII phlegmon,\" or inSamed abscess, 8.1 big 8.1 a hen's egg, on the thigh,\nwith exceaaive tenderness and lan~inating pain. It W8.I necessa.ry\nto open the swelling, but the screaming patient would not a.llow it\nto be touched. Judging this to be a good opportunity for testing the\nreal validity of deferred hypnotic suggestion, Dr. Pitrea hypnotised\nthe woman by looking fixedly in her eyes, and then suggested to her\nthat aj\"ttw .he Iuul bem tJWtJ~ she would allow the absceas to\nbe opened, and would not feel the slightest pain. She was then\nawakened, and apparently resumed her normal state. M. A. Bounier\nproceeded to open and squeeze out the abscess in a deliberate way.\nThe patient merely looked on and smiled. She had no recollection of\nthe suggestion which had been made to her during her trance, and she\nW8.1 not a little 8.ltonished to see her formidable enemy thus disposed\nof without giving her the slightest pain.\nCases like these are certainly striking enough to give a considerable\nimpetus to further experiment. Hypnotism, however, ha.s in England\nmany prejudices to contend with. I shall touch on one such prejudice\nonly--& very excusable one and germane to the main argument of this\npaper. \"These duplications of state,\" it is said, \"are not natural;\nand what is unnatural, even if it is not morbid, can never be more\nthan a mere curiosity.\" I would 8.lk of such an objector one single\nquestion: \"Which state, then, do y.ou consider, 8.1 unnatural, your\nown ordinary sleep or your own ordinary waking' \"\nThis rejoinder goes, I think, to the root of the matter; for we do\nindubitably undergo every day of our lives a change of state, a shift.\ning of our internal mechanism, which is closely parallel to t&e artificial\nchanges whose induction I am here recommending. Our familiar sleep,\nwhether considered from the psychical or the physiological side, h8.1 a\ncurious history, strange potentialities. In its psychical 8.lpect-to\ntake the point which here most concerns us-it involves at lea.st the\nrudiments of a \"second state,\" of an independent memory. I should\nlike, bad I space, to show how the mere recurrence of a dream-scene-\na scene which ha.s no prototype in waking life-is the first stage on the\n1 First given in the Journal de M~duiM th Bordeaux, and cited at length\nin Dr. B~rillon'8 RWlu de I'HypnotiBme for September, 1886.

Leaving this point for future treatment, and passing to sleep's\nphyriological aspect, we recognise in it the compromise or resultant of\nmany tentative duplications of state which our lowly ancestors have\nknown. Their earliest differentiation of condition, it may be, was\nmerely the change between light and darkness, or between motion and\nrest. Then comes encystation, a fruitful quiescence, originally, per-\nhaps, a mere immobility of self-defence, but taken advantage of for\nreproductive effort. And passing from protozoa to metazoa, we find\nnumerous adaptations of this primitive duplicability of condition.\nWe find sleep utilised as a protection against hunger, as a protection\nagainst cold. And, on the other hand, we find animals for whom what\nwe call \"true sleep\" is wanting, whose circumstances do not demand\nany such change or interruption in the tenor of their lifelong way.\nYet why describe this undifferentiated life-history as a state of\nwaking rather than of sleep 1 Why assume that sleep is the acquired,\nvigilance the \"normal\" condition 1 It would not be hard to defend\nan opposite thesis. The new-born infant might urge with cogency that\nhis habitual state of slumber was primary as regards the individual,\nancestral as regards the race; resembling at least, far more closely\nthan does our adult life, a primitive or protozoic habit. \"Mme,\" he\nmight say, \"is a centrally stable state. It would need only some\nchange in external conditions (as my permanent immersion in a nutri-\ntive fluid) to be safely and indefinitely maintained. Your waking state,\non the other hand, is centrally unstable. While you talk and bustle\naround me you are living on your physiological capital, and the mere\nprolongation of vigilance is torture and death.\"\nA paradox such as this forms no part of my argument; but it may\nremind us that physiology at any rate hardly warrants us in speaking\nof our waking state as if that alone represented our true selves, and\nevery deviation from it must be at best a mere interI'llption. Vigilance\nin reality is but one of two co-ordinate phases of our personality, which\nwe have acquired or differentiated from each other during the stages of\nour long evolution. And just as these two states have come to co-exist\nfor us in advantageous alterna.tion, so also other states may come to c0-\nexist with these, in response to new needs of the still evolving\norganism.\nAnd I will now suggest two methods in which such states as those\ndescribed, say, in Dr. Voisin's or in Dr. Pitres' case, might be turned\nto good account. In the world around us a.re many physical invalids\nand many\" moral invalids,\" and of both these classes a certain per-\ncentage are sure to prove hypnotisable, with patience and care. Let\nus try to improve the moral invalid's character by hypnotic s~gestions\nDigitized by l::.oogle\n\f510 Multiplex Per807W.lity.\nof self-restraint, which will continue effective after he wakes. And\nlet us try to enable the physical invalid to carry on his intellectual life\nwithout the pertuI'bing accompaniment of pain. I am not bringing out\na panacea, and I expect that with the English race, and in our present\nstate of knowledge, but few of these experiments will succeed. But\nincrea.aed experience will bring the process under fuller control, will\nenable us to hypnotise a larger proportion of persons and to direct the\nresulting phenomena with more precision. What is needed is the per-\nseverance in experiment which springs from an adequate rea.lisa.tion of\nthe ultimate gain, from a conviction that the tortuous inlet which we\nare navigating is one of the mouths of a river which runs up far int.o\nthe unexplored interior of our being.\nI have dealt elsewhere with some further cases which go to show\nthe persistent efficacy of moralising suggestions-suggeations mainly\nof abstinence from pernicious indulgences-when made to a subject in\nthe hypnotic trance.1 It must suffice here to point out that such\nmorahsation, whether applied to a sane or an insane subject, must by no\nmeans be considered as a mere trick or a mere abnormality. It is but the\nsystematisation of a process on which religious and moral \"revivals\"\nhave always largely depended. When some powerful personage has\nthrown many weaker minds into a state of unusual perturbation,\nunusual plasticity, there is an element in that psychical tumult which\nmay be utilised for lasting good. A strong suggestion may be made,\nand its effect on the brain will be such that it will work itself out,\nalmost automatically, perhaps for years to come. When Father Mathew\nspread the temperance pledge through Ireland he showed this power at\nits best. What it can be at its worst we see, for instance, in the recent\nepidemic of frenzy in the Bahamas, where the hysterical symptoms were\nactually the main object sought, and the dogma only served to give to\nthat hysteria a stimulating flavour of brimstone. Scenes not dissimilar\nhave been witnessed in England too; yet the sober moralist has been\nforced to recognise that a germ of better life has often been\ndropped, and has quickened, amid the turbulence of what to him might\nseem a mere scandalous orgy.\nJust so did the orthodox physician look on in disgusted contempt at\nthe tumultuous crUea of the patients around Mesmer's baquet. But\nscience has now been able to extract from that confused scene its germ\nof progress, and to use a part of Mesmer's processes to calm the very\naccesses which Mesmer employed them to generate. Let her attempt,\nthen, to extract the health\u00b7giving element from that moral turbulence\nas well, and to use the potency which in ignorant hands turns men and\nwomen into hysterical monomaniacs, to revive in the spirits which she\ndominates the docility of the little child.\n1 Proceeding8 of the S. P.R.\u2022 Part X. G I\nizedby oog e\n\fMultipla; P8TSO'fI.ality. 511\nThis last phrase represents a true, an important ana.logy. The art\nof education, as we know, rests on the physiologica.l fact that the child's\nbrain receives impressions more readily, and retains them more lastingly,\nthan the adult's. And those of us who have been well drilled in child-\nhood are not apt to consider that the advantage thus gained for us was\nan nnfair or tricky one, nor even that virtue has been made unduly\neasy to us, so that we deserve no credit for doing right. It surely need\nnot, then, be considered as over\u00b7reaching Destiny, or outwitting the\nMoral Law, if we take persons whose early receptiveness has been\nabused by bad example and try to reproduce that receptiveness by a\nphysiologica.l process, and to imprint hypnotic suggestions of a salutary\nkind.\nI ventured to make a proposal of this sort in a paper published in\n1885; but, although it attracted some comment as a novelty, I cannot\nflatter myself that it was taken au ,erieuz by the pedagogic world.\nBut as I write these lines I see from a report of the Association\nFranqais pour l'Avancement des Sciences (Session de Nancy, 1886) that\nthe \"Section de Pedagogie \" has actually passed a resolution desiring\n\" que des experiences de suggestion hypnotique soient tentees, dans un\nbut de mora.lisation et d'education, sur quelques-uns des slljets les plus\nnotoirement mauvais et incorrigibles des ~coles primaires.\" I commend\nthe idea then, with the sense that I am not alone in my paradox, to the\nattention of practical philanthropists.\nMy second suggestion-namely, that we may conceivably learn to\ncarry on our intellectual life in a state of insusceptibility to physical\npain, may appear a quite equally bold one. \"We admit,\" the critics\nmight say, \"that a man in the hypnotic trance is insensible to\npinching; but, since he can also notoriously, when in that state, be\nmade to believe that his name is Titus Oates, or that a candle-end\nis a piece of plum-ca.ke, or any other absurdity, the intellectual work\nwhich he performs in that mood of mind is not likely to be worth\nmuch.\" But my point is, as may have been already gathered, that\nthis clean-cut, definite conception of the hypnotic state is now shown\nto have been crude and rudimentary. Dr. Pitres' case, above cited\n(where the patient was restored to ordinary life in all respects except\nthat she continued insensible to pain), is a mere sample of cases daily\nbecoming more numerous, where power is gained to dissociate the ele-\nments of our being in novel ways, to form from them, if I may so say,\nnot only the one strange new compound\" hypnotic trance,\" but a whole\nseries of compounds marking the various stages between that and the\nlife of every day. Hysterica.l phenomena, now for the first time studied\nwith something like the attention which they deserve, point strongly in\nthis direction. And apart from hysteria., apart from hypnotism, we\nfind in active and healthy life scattered hints of the possible a\\lqence oj.\n!?,g,tized by l:.oogle\n\f512\npain during vigorous intellectual effort. From the candidate in & com-\npetitive examination who forgets his toothache till he comes out again.\nto the soldier in action unconscious of the bullet-wound till he faints\nfrom lOBS of blood, we have instances enough of an exaltation or con-\ncentration which has often made the resolute spirit altogether uncen-\nscious of conditions which would have been absorbing to the ordinary\nman. And here too, as in the case of moral suggestibility, eJ.ready\ndealt with, the function of science is to regularise the accidental and to\nelicit from the mingled phenomenon its permanent boon. Already men\nattempt to do this by a mere chemical agency. There have been philo-\nsophers who have sought in laudanum intellectual lucidity and bodily\nrepose. There have been soldiers who have supplemented with \" Dutch\ncourage\" the ardour of martial fire. Philosopher and soldier alike ex-\npose themselves to an unhappy reaction. But by the induction of\nhypnotic a.n.thesia we are taking a shorter road to our object; we are\nacting on the central nervous system without damaging stomach or liver\non the way. It was an abridgment of this kind when sub-cutaneous\ninjection of morphia replaced in so many cases morphia taken by the\nmouth. Yet though the evil done in tranritu was subtler and slower,\nevil still was done. On the other hand the direct non-chemical action\non the central nervous system, in which hypnotism consists. ia not\nproved to be in any way necessarily injurious, and has thus far, when\nunder careful management, resulted almost uniformly in good. Such\nat least is the view of all physicians, so far as I know, who have\npractised it themselves on a large scale, though it is not the general\nview a.t present of those men-physicians or others-who are content\nto judge from hearsay and to write at second-hand.\nLet us not then, I would say, be satisfied if we can merely give\nsome poor sufferer a good night by hypnotism, or even if we can operate\non him painlessly in a state of trance. Let us approach the topic of\nthe banishment of pain in a more thoroughgoing and bolder spirit.\nLooking at that growing class of civilised persons who suffer from\nneuralgia, indigestion, and other annoying but not dangerous forms of\nmalaise, let us consider whether we cannot induce-in those of them\nwho are fortunate enough to be readily hypnotisable-a third condition\nof life, which shall be as waking but without its uneasiness and as sleep\nwithout the blankness of its repose, a state in which the mind may go\nserenely onwards and the body have no power to distract her energy or\nto dispute hersway.\nIs there anything in nature to render this ideal impossible 1 Let\nus consider the history of pain. Pain, it may be plausibly suggesU!d,\nis an advantage acquired by our ancestors in the course of their\nstruggle for existence. It would be useless to the fortunate animal-\ncule, which, if you chop it in two, is simply two animalcules instead of\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fMultiplex PersonoJ,ity. 513\none. But as soon as the organism is complex enough to suffer partial\ninjury, and active enough to check or avoid such injury before it has\ngone far, the pain becomes a useful warning, and the sense of pain'\nis thus one of the first and most generalised of the perceptive faculties\nwhich place living creatures in relation with the external world. And\nto the human infant it is necessary still. The burnt child must have\nsome reason to dread the fire, or he will go on poking it with his fingers.\nBut, serviceable though pain may still be to the child and the savage,\ncivilised men and women have now a good deal more of it than they can\nfind any use for. Some kinds of pain, indeed (like neuralgia, which\npr6116'l&t8 the needed rest), are wholly detrimental to the organism, and\nhave arisen by mere correlation with other susceptibilities which are in\nthemselves beneficial. Now if this correlation were inevitable-if it\nwere impossible to have acute sense-perceptions, vivid emotional de-\nvelopment, without these concomitant nervous pains-we should have\nto accept the annoyance without more ado. But certain spontaneously\noccurring facts, and certain tlxperimental facts, have shown us that the\ncorrelation is not inevitable; that the sense of pain can be abolished,\nwhile other sensibilities are retained, to an extent far beyond what the\ncommon experience of life would have led us to suppose possible.\nOur machinery is hampered by a system of checks, intended to guard\nagainst dangers which we can now meet in other ways, and often\noperating as a serious hindrance to the work of our manufactory. A\nworkman here and there has hit on an artifice for detaching these checks,\nwith signal advantage, and is beginning to report to the managers his\nguess at a wider application of the seemingly trivial contrivance.\nBe it mentioned too that not only pain itself, but anxiety, ennui,\nintellectual fatigue, may be held in abeyance by hypnotic treatment\nand suggestion. There is not, indeed, much evidence of any increase\nof sheer intellectual acumon in the hypnotic state, but in most kinds\nof ordinary brain-work the difficulty is not so much that one's actual\npower of thinking is inadequate to the problems proposed as that one\ncannot use that power aright, cannot focus one's object steadily or\ngaze on it long. Hypnotism may not supply one with mental lenses\nof higher power, but in its artificial attention we have at least the\nrudiment of a machinery like that which holds firm the astronomer's\ntelescope and sweeps it round with the moving heavens, as compared\nwith the rough and shifting adjustments of a spy-glass held in the hand.\nThese speculations, especially where they point to moral progress\nas attainable by physiological artifice, will seem to many of my readers\nventuresome and unreal. And in these days of conflicting dogmas and\nimpracticable Utopias, Science, better aware than either priest or\ndemagogue of how little man can truly know, is tempted to confine\nherself to his material benefit, which can be made certain, and to let\nDigitized by Coogle ..0\"\n\f514 Multiple:e Per8onality.\nhis moral progress-which is a speculative hope--alone. Yet, now\nthat Science is herself becoming the substance of so many creeds, the\nlode-star of so many aspirations, it is important that she should not in\nany direction even appear to be either timid or cynical. Her humble\nmiBBionaries at least need not show themselves too solicitous about\npoBBible failure, but should rather esteem it as dereliction of duty\nwere some attempt not made to carry her illumination over the whole\nrealm and mystery of man.\nEspecially, indeed, is it to De desired that biology should show-\nnot indeed a moralising bias, but-a moral care. There has been a\nnatural tendency to insist with a certain diaillusionising tenacity on\nthe low beginnings of our race. When eminent but ill-instructed\npersonages in Church or State have declared themselves, with many\nflourishes, \"on the side of the Angel,\" there has been a grim satisfaction\nin proving that Science at any rate is \"on the side of the Ape.\" But\nthe victory of Science is won. She has dealt hard measure to man's\ntradition and his self-conceit; let her now show herself ready to sym-\npathise with such of his aspirations as are still legitimate, to offer such\nprospects as the nature of things will allow. Nay, let her teach the\nworld that the word evolution is the very formula and symbol of\nhope.\nBllt here my paper must close. I will conclude it with a single\nreflection which may somewhat meet the fears of those who dislike any\ntamperings with our personality, who dread that this invading analysis\nmay steal their very self away. All living things, it is said, strive\ntowards their maximum of pleasure. In what hours, then, and under\nwhat conditions, do we find that human beings have attained to their\nintensest joy 7 Do not our thoughts in answer turn instinctively to\nscenes and moments when all personal pre-occupation, all care for\nindividual interest, is lost in the sense of spiritual union, whether with\none beloved soul, or with a mighty nation, or with \"the whole\nworld and creatures of God\" 7 We think of Dante with Beatrice, of\nNelson at Trafalgar, of S. Francis on the Umbrian hill. And surely\nhere, as in Galahad's cry of \" If I lose myself I find myself,\" we have\na hint that much, very much, of what we are wont to regard as an\nintegral part of us may drop away, and yet leave us with a con-\nsciousness of our own being which is more vivid and purer than\nbefore. This web of habits and appetencies, of lusts and fears, is not,\nperhaps, the ultimate manifestation of what in truth we are. It is\nthe cloak which our rude forefathers have woven themselves against the\ncosmic storm; but we are already learning to shift and refashion it as\nour gentler weather needs, and if perchance it slip from us in the sun-\nshine then something more ancient and more glorious is for a moment\ngueBBed within.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fStages of Hypnotic Memury. 515\nVIII.\nSTAGES OF HYPNOTIC MEMORY.\nBy EDMUND GURNEY.\nOn a former occasion (Proceedings, Vol. II., pp. 69-70) I drewatten-\ntion to some remarkable peculiarities of memory which may be observed\nin hypnotic\" subjects.\" It has, of course, long been recognised as one of\nthe most striking characteristics of hypnotic trance, in any but its very\nlightest stages, that the \"subject\" is oblivious, on waking, of what he\nhas said and done, and of all that has passed in his presence, while the\ntranCtHlOndition lasted; but tha.t, when he is re-hypnotised, these\nvanished memories recur to his mind. But the trance-condition had\nalways, in relation to memory, been treated as a Bingle state; or at\nany rate as double only in the sense that in its deeper stages conscious-\nness seemed so completely to lapse that no impression at all could be\nmade on the\"subject's\" mind, and consequently no material for memory\ncould be stored there. Experiment showed, however, the existence\nof positive and distinct stages of memory within the conscious portion\nof the hypnotic trance. After being brought into a light stage of trance\n-what we may call state A-the \"subject\" is told something, with a\ndirection to remember it. He is then carried into a deeper stage of\ntrance-state B, and is asked what it was that he had just been told;\nhe proves quite unable to reca.ll it, and even to recall the fact that any-\nthing has been told him. He is now told something fresh, with a\ndirection to remember it, after which he is recalled to state A; and\nnow, when asked what he has been told, he does not mention and can-\nnot recall what he heard a few moments before in state B, but\nrepeats instead what had been told him in the prior state A, in\nwhich he now again finds himself. Brought once more to state B,\nhe similarly remembers what he had been told in that state, while\nagain completely oblivious of what was impressed on him in state A.\nOn waking, he retains no memory of anything that has been told\nhim; 1 though if ordered, in the trance, to remember and mention some\nparticular item on waking, he will do so. I made the trials with a\nconsiderable number of .. subjects,\" in different parts of England,\nemploying three different hypnotisers, to each of whom the results were\n1 This is nearly, but not quite, invariable; with one \"subject\" I have\ntwice found the thing told him in state A to be dimly remembered on waking-\nI presume because it had been told while the trance was still in ita very\nlightest stage.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f516 Stages of HYP'Mtic M6'I'IIAYrY.\n&8 new and surprising &8 they were at first to myself; there seem..\nreason to think, therefore, that the results are tolerably normal,l and\nnot due to any special idiosyncrasies of operator or \"subject\" ; as they\ncertainly were not due to any guidance, or any interference with the\nfree play of the\" subject's\" mind, in the remarks addressed to him\nduring the progress of the experiment. I always found the two stage-s\nwell marked, though in one or two cases we seemed to get upon a sort\nof knife-edge, when for a short time both the impressions seemed to be\nsimultaneously remembered. The mode of effecting the passage from one\nstage to another has usually consisted in gentle passes over the fare,\nwithout contact; but with one operator, the same effect was produced\nmainly or altogether by verbal suggestion-e.g., by the simple direction,\n\"Go deeper,\" several times reiterated. I must not digress into a\ndiscussion of the nature of the influence which the passes exercise; but\nI may just say that no experiments are better calculated to display the\nwonderful delicacy of that particular mode of affection, in the case of\npersons with whom it has been the rule to employ it. To the student\nof hypnotism the immediate responsiveness of the subject's mind and\norganism to the appropriate stimuli comes to seem as much a matter of\ncourse as that the tones of an organ should vary iu obedience to thP.\nhand which turns on or shuts off the different stops; but among all\nthese notable instances of stop-management on the human instrument,\nnone is more impressive than to find that a few noiseless movements of\none person's fingers, at a short distance from another person's face, bave\ncompletely obliterated that with which the latter's attention two or\nthree seconds ago was entirely engrossed, and have brought back within\nhis mental horizon that which no other means in the world-no other\nphysical operation, not the clearest verbal reminder, not the fear of\ndeath, nor the offer of '\u00a31,000 reward~ould have induced or enabled\nhim to recall.\nThough there is nothing which would have prepared us for these\nmemory-stages-since the passage from normal waking to deep hypnotic\nsleep is apparently a perfectly gradual one-it may be observed that\n~\" we occasionally find some sort of analogy to them in dreams; though\nas these do not admit of deliberate testing, and the test has to be got\n1 I am speakiag of cases where the trance\u00b7condition is definitely estab\u00b7\nlished-in the sense that the\" subject,\" if left to himself, willlapee into a deep\nstate otslumber, in which he shows a high degree ofinsensibility to sound and to\npain, and from which only the Origillal operator can rapidly bring him back &0\nthe normal wakingstate. I should notexpectto get similar results in the very\nlight forms of hypnotic aifection which are so common in France; where the\nphysical deviation from normality is far less marked, and the .. snbject \" comes\nto himself, after the little course of therapeutic suggestion has been gone\nthrough, without any special means, and often without &11y break in the\ncontinuity of conscionsn8811.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fSto{Jes of Hypnotic Memury. 517\nso to speak, out of the dream itself, which naturally retains some\nsort of continuity of incident, the analogy is of a very broken and\nimperfect sort. The following case was lately sent to me by my friend,\nMr. David Stewart, of Milton of Campsie, a careful and accurat.e\nreporter.\nI don't know whether a caae of \"alternating memory\" during ordinary\ndreaming may be of the slightest interest to you. This morning, in a dream\nabout u ridiculous u dreama usually are, a number of circumstances led me\nto amputate the tail ot a pony belonging to the farmer with whom I live, and\nwhile I wu vainly endeavouring to fix it on again, the farmer came in. At\nthis point all the previous circumstances of the dream were forgotten, and I\nracked my brains in a hopeless attempt to explain the state of affairs.\nMemory W88 a blank, and still remains so. However, as the pony\nseemed likely to die, we lifted it into a large pot that wu heating over the\nkitchen fire to give it a warm bath, and I went oft\" for the veterinary\nsurgeon. On the way I seemed partially to waken up, though still walking\non the road to town. I felt that the events at the farm had 1teen a dream,\nand I turned and walked back, feeling quite relieved.\nOnce home, however, the whole thing returned. Here wu the pony,\nstill in the pot. Every idea that 1 had been dreaming wu gone. I only\nknew that I had gone for the vet. and come back without him. After some\nmore fooling I awoke.\nAll thia seems very silly, but it shows the existence of four diatinctlayera,\n&8 it were, of consciouanoas.\n1. That of the first part of the dream, cut oft\" by a sharp line of forgetful-\nness from all the rest.\n2. The second and lut part of the dream, which seem to be on the same\nlevel.\n3. The middle, when I \" dreamt it wu a dream.\" This too wu cutoft\"\nsharply from the lut part of No.2.\n4. Waking consciousness j remembering 2, 3, and 4, but not No.1.\nWith the assistance of M.r. G. A. Smith (whom I will in future call\nS.), I have lately made a fresh series of experiments in hypnotic memory,\nin which some further points have been observed; and it may make\nthe matter more intt,lligible to give the details of a few cases. The\ngreat point, of course, is to use the right means for ascertaining\nwhether the thing told is or is not remembered. It would never\ndo to begin by asking the \"subject\" point-blank, \"Do you remember\nsuch and such a thing 1\"-as, if he were inclined to simulate, he might\nsay\" Yes,\" though, in fact, he did not remember it; while, apart from\nany question of simulation, the mere mention of this thing might recall\nit to him, though it had lapsed beyond recall had his mind been left to\nitself. A very little skill will surmount this difficulty. The first\nquestion should be asked in some neutral form of words, which will be\nunderstood as referring to one particular thing if that particular thing\nis truly remembered, but which, if it meets with no response implying\nmemory, will equally serve as the introduction to some fresh ~ic. I\nDigitized by ~C\\P8 e\n\f518 Stages of Hypnotic Memory.\nThe following are epitomised samples of the sort of convel\"8&tion\nwhich occurred.\nA young man named S--t, (often mentioned in my paper on\n\"Peculiarities of certain Post-hypnotic States\") after being hypnotised,\nwas told in state A that the pier-head had been washed away, and in\nstate B that an engine-boiler had burst at Brighton station, and killecl\nseveral people. He was then roused to state A, when he proved to\nrecollect about the accident to the pier; after which a few passes\nbrought him again to state B.\nS.l \" But I suppose they'll soon be able to build a new one.\"\nHad the pier been now present in S--t's mind, this remark\nwould have been naturally understood to refer to it, as it had formed\nthe subject of conversation a few seconds before. But he at once\nreplied, \"Oh, there are plenty on the line\"-mearung plenty of\nengines.\nS. \"The pile-driving takes time, though.\"\nS-T. \"Pile-driving\u00a5 Well, I don't know anything about\nengines myself.\"\nA few upward passes were now made, and it at once becomes clear\nthat the memory has shifted.\nS. \" If they have plenty more, it doesn't matter much.\"\nS-T. \" Oh, they can't put it on in a day; it was a splendid\nplace.\"\nS. \"Why, I'm talking about the engine.\"\nB-T. \" Engine! What, on the pier' I never noticed one there_\"\nAgain, the same \"subject\" was told in state A that a ba.lloon had\nbeen seen passing over the King's-road. Some passes were made\nwhich carried him into state B, when S. said, \"But I didn't see it\nmyself.\"\nS--T. \" What was tha.t1\"\nHe was now told that two large dogs had been having a fight in\nthe Western-road; and a few upward passes roused him to state A.\nS.

The above conversation\nwas then continued.\nS. \" Do you remember that accident that there was at Brighton'\"\nS-T. \"What, at the Grand Hotel, when that lift went up 1\"\nS. \"Ah, we were talking of several ACcidents; wasn't there another\nin-in West-street1\"\nS-T. \"No. The hotel is at the bottom of West-street.\" (It is\nvery near to the junction of West-street with the King's-road.)\nHe is now roused, and S. continues, \"Oh, just at the bottom of\nWest-street, is it1\"\nB-T. \"Not quite; nearly.\"\nS. \"What is 1\"\nS-T. \" The church.\"\nS. \" What church1\"\nB-T. \"That one the steeple fell off; you were telling me about\nit.

But there\nwere lOme of a more unusual kind. As I have said, the rule is to\nobtain Cwo .tate. or st&ge8. If the attempt is made to carry the\ntrance-oondition beyond state B, the eft'ect is either to bring the\n\"subject\" into an apparently deep Bleep, in which he is incapable of\nanswering, and probably of hearing; or to create .uch a desire for\nsleep, and aversion to hP.ing queatiooed, that he becomea more or less\nintractable. With one\" subject\" I have found that even the second\nstage, on one or two occaaiona, could not be obtained. In this deepen-\ning proceaa .leep and apparent unconsciousness supervened before any\ndividing line hadbeen established; 10 that, up to the last moment when he\ncould answer queationa, the nlemory of the things told him immediately\nafter his entrancement remained. But there are other caaea which are\nexceptional in just the opposite direction-eaaea where the course of\nthe trance allows a distinct third stage of memory to manifest itself\nbefore unconsciousness seta in. The following instance will make this\nclear.\nIn .tate A, S-t was hypnotised; and the fact of his being in\natate A waa ascertained by his remembering the balloon over the\nKing's-road, and forgetting the dog fight and the engine-accident--\nthe ideas of state B. He was now told that a foreign flag had been\nseen floating over the Pavilion, and was then carried on into state B,\nwhen S. said, \"People may well complain.\"\nS-T. \"Yea.\"\nS. \"Why 1\"\nS--T. \"Why, the nuiaance-thoae dogs fighting in the Western-\nroad.\" (The idea proper to state B is revived.)\nS. \"No, I meant about the flag.\"\nS-T. \"What flag t There are plenty of flags about.\" (The\nidea proper to state A is forgotten.)\nS. \" No, I meant that cart running away in Montpelier-road \"-a\nnew idea, which will belong henceforth to the B claas.\nS--T. \"What cart 1\" Then, scornfully, \"Cart running away!\nIt's the horae that runs away.\"\nHe was then informed more particularly that a horse with a cart\nhad bolted in Montpelier-road; and the deepening passes were\ncontinued.\nS. \" So they found it bottom upwards.\"\nThere was no answer; the \"subject\" had lapsed into sleep. He\nwas called by name, and a few reverse passes were made-when he\nwoke with an \"Eh , \"\nS. \"They found it bottom upwards.\"\nB-T. \" What' When t\"\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fStages of Hypnotic Merll.ory. 523\nS. \"A boat, I mean.\" He was then told that a very high tide\nhad washed away a boat on the beach; but that after a time it had\ndrifted ashore. This idea was suggested in what proved to be a\nseparate and third stage, C, when he was on the very verge of lapsing\ninto unconsciousness; and he did lapse immediately afterwards. He\nwas roused, and S. said, \"That's the effect of not tying it securely.\"\nS-t's answers now showed that the rousing had carried him over\nstage C, and that he was once more in stage B. He said, \"Tied t\nThey never tie them.\"\nS. \"No wonder it was washed away then.\"\nB--T. \"Washed away! Did it go over the clift'1\"\nS. \"No; what do you mean 1\"\nB--T. \" That horse and cart you were talking about.\"\nHere, then, was the stage B idea, the boat of stage C being\nforgotten. It remained to ascertain that what I have called stage C\nwas not identical with stage A-that there had been a real progression\nbeyond stage B, and not a mere oscillation between the A a.nd B states.\nAccordingly, some reverse passes were made, with the view of bringing\nthe subject into the A state; and S. said, \"I dare say it will get\nknocked about on the beach.\"\nS-T. \" What knocked about t\"\nS. \"What I was telling you about.\"\nS--T. \"Why, have they taken it on the beach now, then 1\"\nS. \" It was on the beach.\"\nB--T. \"Why, you said it was on the Pavilion.\"\nS. \" What do you mean 1\"\nB--T. \"That large flag.\"\nHere then was the stage A idea, and the memory of the boat of\nstage C proved as unrevivable as it had been in stage B. S--t was\nnow carried down without pause into the state of deep sleep-the most\ncertain way of lighting on stage C being to go beyond it in this way,\nand then to revive the\" subject\" just enough to enable him to under-\nstand and answer. He was called by name several times, and a few\nreverse passes were made, before he answered, \" Eh 1 what t \" S.\nreplied in words which would apply equally to carts or boats; but, as I\nexpected, they were understood as applying to boats-the stage C idea.\nS. \" Is it customary to tie them 1\"\nS--T. \"Yes.\"\nS. \" I thought you said it wasn't,\" (He had said before that it\nwas not customary to tie carts.)\nB--T. \" Oh, yes; sometimes they tie them to capstans, sometimes\nto larger vessels.\"\nHe was now questioned about the cart, but had no remembrance of\nit; also about the dog-fight (which, the reader will recall, was another\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f5241 Btagea of Hypnotic Memory.\natage B idea), with the same result. Some upward pasaea were noW'\nmade, and S. laid, \"Did you say they tie them to a capatan t n\nS-T. u No; they throw the reins loose over the horae's back..\"\nS. \" A lot of people saw it coming down.\"\nS-T. \" What, the horae and cart t n\nHere is evidently the reappearance of stage B; and proceeding\nagain on the upward or lightening course, we found the A idea, the ftag\non the Pavilion, duly remembered. This WIUI on February 28th. On\nMarch 2nd, the lame process was briefly repeated. Thus after the\n\" subject\" had proved his recollection of the flag, he was carried\nstraight on into the furthest state, and S. laid, \"Have you heard of\nsomething running away t\"\nS-T. \"No; not \"\"ming away; it lwo~ away on the beach;\nbut it washed in again.\" (Here is stage C, stage B having been\ncrossed without any questions.)

And so on.\nI will give one more instance of these memory alternations, which\nincludes the third state. Immediately after the last appearance of the\nboat, which belonged, it will be remembered, to stage C, S-t was\ntold that Brill's Baths were going to be transformed into a circus-\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fBtagea of HYFMtic Memory. 525\nwhich, he opined, wonld never pay.

But a few more passes\nbring back state A completely.\nS. \"Was there to be something on the West Clifft \"\nS-T. \"You said the hotel was to be on the East Cliff.\" (A.)\nHe is carried further, and S. says, \"On the East Clift; is it to be,\"\nS-T. \"Why, they've got one there I\"\nS. \"One what 1\"\nS--T. \"An electric railway,\"-which is true. From his exclaiming\n\"Why they've got one there,\" it may be inferred that the hotel (A) was\nnow forgotten, and that the idea of the new Electric Railway (B)\nwhich he had been told was to be on the We,' Cliff, had reappeared.\nThe state is now deepened, and S. says, \"Oh, they have got\none 1\"\nS--T. \"No, not yet.\"\nS. \"What!\"\nS--T. \"Why, a new spire to St. Paul's.\" (C.)\nBrought back to state A, he remembers the hotel on the East Cliff,\nbut when the new spire is suggested, he remarks, \"What, to that\nchurch at Kemp-town 1\"\nThese samples are fair types of the dialogues that passed, and will\nsufficiently show, I think, that the results were fairly observed, and not\nforced or fished for in the course of the interrogatories. But it may be\nobjected that I am taking the honesty of the \" subjects\" too much for\ngranted, and that they may have acted their parts. Now, I should\ncertainly not base a conclusion as to the genuineness of the experiments\non the fact--which my experie-nce of these \"subjects\" put quite beyond\ndoubt--that they were in a true hypnotic state. I am very far indeed\nfrom holding that because a person is hypnotised he is incapable of\ndeceit; indeed, I think it by no means improbable that even honest\npersons may be guilty of what looks like chicanery during that\ntemporary dislocation of the mental machinery which the turning of the\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fStageIJ of Hypnotic Me'1rW'1\"Y. 527\nhypnotic screw involves} But, putting morbid and exceptional cases\naside, I would unhesitatingly assert that, with patience and observa-\ntion, one may learn to know one's \"subject\" in the abnormal\nstate, even as one may learn to know him in the normal state. He is a\nnew person, with decided eccentricities, and he might fail to recognise\nhimself; but, for all that, he has a quite recognisable character, the\nmanifestations of whi~h, in the narrow range of circumstances with\nwhich he is brought into contact, are specially constant and easy to\npredict. Thus one comes to trust, or, it may be, to distrust him, just\nas one might any other acquaintance. Now the tone, demeanour, and\nstyle of conversation of the \"subjects\" on whom these observations were\nmade have always been perfectly open, candid, and consistent; there\nhas never boon the slightest sign of trickiness or evasion. I really\nowe this expression of confidence to their hypnotic character, as I am\nalmost ashamed to feel how exclusively the high level of untr\\lthfulness\nwhich the above dialogues undoubtedly maintained was due to my own\nshare in them. Not, of course, that I should expect to impart my\ngradually-acquired confidence to others, who have to accept the grounds\nfor it at second hand; but such considerations may fairly be used\nto reinforce more definite arguments. These are at least three\nin number. (1) The young men whom I employed had no means of dis-\ncovering what results would be to my liking. Though it was, of course,\nimpossible for Mr. Smith and me, after the stages had once manifested\nthemselves, not to expect the results to turn out in the main as they\ndid, we were careful to give the \" subjects\" no opportunity of knowing\nwhat these expectations were. The matter was never discussed in their\npresence, either when they were entranced or when they were awake-\nexcept that on wlJoking they were offered a sovereign if they could\nrepeat anything that had been told them in the trance; and no\nexpressions of satisfaction or dissatisfadion, or comments of any sort,\naccompanied the experiments. I may mention, too, that in five distinct\ninstances, through my forgetfulness, this or that \" subject\" was\ninterrogated, when in a partiCUlar state, on topics which had been\npreviously mentioned to one of the others when in that state, but not to\nhim. On these occasions his mind appeared to be a complete blank as to\nwhat was referred to. I imagined, therefore, that there was some failure\n1 This seems to be the esse also in other abnormal manifestations, as iittle\nconnected as hypnotism need be with bodily, mental, or moral disease. Some\nof my readers will recall the Newnham experiments (PkantaBma oftM Living,\nVol. I., pp. 63\u00b79), where some (\\f the answers, written with a planchette,\nshow~ a trickiness quite alien to the real charact.er of the person who held it ;\nand In the same class we may reckon the baseleBB predictions and ludicroUll\nclaims with which this little instrument so often deceives those who have been\nuncoDBCioualy directing it.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f528 St01Je8 of Hypnotic Memory.\nor irregularity in these results-until an examination of my fonner notes\nshowed me what the explanation was. (2) Even supposing tha.t one\n\" subject\" might have hit, by luck or cunning, on the hypothesis of\nmemory-stages, and might have divined that this was what I had in my\nmind, and BO tried to act it out, what are the chances that several\nshould have independently done BO' It must be remembered that the\nexperiments were as new to each of them in turn as at first they were\nto me; and with each of them the results were as clearand unmistakea.ble\non the first day as ever afterwards. (3) Even if luck or cunning had\nled them all to the discovery, it is surely most improbable that they\nshould all have had BO unbroken a run of success, in a complicated task\nrequiring, one would think, much natural aptitude, and certainly much\nquick observation and presence of mind. Though there are special\nways in which hypnotic differs from normal intelligence, the difference\nhas never been observed to lie in a superiority of nimble practical wit.\nAn untrained lad, when hypnotised, might surpass his normal self at\nlearning a lesson by rote, but not at a game like whist.\nOf the fresh points of interest which this series of experiments\nexhibited, the first relates to the effect which persistent bothering\napparently had on the memory-conditions. The effect was in some\ncases to obliterate the older impressions, but never to ConfU86 them.\nImpreBBions made in state A did not reappear in state B, nor 'Dice t:enJ4;\nbut impressions made on BOme previous day, in one state, might fail to\nreappear when that state reappeared, if a newer impression connected\nwith the state had taken too strong a hold on the mind. Thus, atthe be-\nginning of the experiments on 1;i'ebruary 28th,S-t remembered,in state\nA and state B respectively, the impressions which had been connected\nwith those states on February 26th; but after the various ups and\ndowns of the journey to stage C and back again, and the giddy merry-\ngo-round of flags, carts, and boats, he was unable to recall the balloon,\nin state A, and the dog-fight, in state B; though (as we have seen)\nremaining perfectly clear as to the new impreBBions now associated with\nthese two states respectively. And on March 2nd, though the ideas of\nFebruary 28th were each remembered in the appropriate state, no\namount of suggestion could bring to remembrance the impressions of an\nolder date. Exactly the same thing occurred on March 3rd. The\nimpressions of March 2nd were remembered, each in the proper stage,\nat the beginning of the sitting, but could not be revived at its close,\nafter a course of questions connected with a fresh series of impressions.\nA second observation was that what I have called the\" knife-edge,\"\nthe middle line where the ideas of both stages were now and then\nfor a moment present together, can apparently be broadened out with\nhabit; the sharp angle becomes a gentle curve, and the stages at either\nend which remain completely out of sight of one another shrink\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fStages of Hypnotic Mem,ory. 529\nproportionately in extent. Thus with W -s, whose mind has been\ncarried over the ground again and again, one has now to be careful\nto impress the second or \" state B \" idea when he is closely approaching\nthe deep speechless condition which marks the limit of the experiment.\nAnother fact which clearly came out was that people have good and\nbad hypnotic memories, just as they have good and bad ordinary\nmemories. Afrer an interval of less than three weeks, all the ideas th3t\nhad been impressed on S-t proved to be forgotten and unrevivable,\nwith one doubtful exception; and in perfect harmony with this, I\nfound that it was impossible to get this\" subject \" to execute an\norder alongue ecMance. He was told in the trance on March 3rd that\nhe was to do a particular thing on March 28th; but the order had\ncompletely faded from his remembrance on March 23rd.\nBut a more important point was this-that even where the\nmemories remain clear, the distinct separation of states may\nbe temporary only. The case in which this was first shown\ngreatly surprised me, as it was the first irregularity that had\npresented itself in many scores of trials. On March 2nd,W-s, while\nundoubtedly in state B, recalled the story of the balloon, which\nbelonged to state A; and a few minutes afterwards, while in state A,\nhe remembered the engine-accident which belonged to state B. Now\nboth the ideas which seemed thus to be remembered out of their proper\nstates had been impressed on him a week previously. In the interval\na good many conversations of the type above exemplified had been\nheld; and my first notion was that by ourselves repeatedly suggesting,\nin one state or the other, the idea not proper to that state-in order to\nshow that in the wrong state no amount of suggestion would quicken\nthe paralysed memory-we had by degrees created an independent\nimpression of the A thing in the B state, (or vice versd,) or had at any\nrate given the \"subject\" the material from which he could himself\npiece out some knowledge of it. The answers, however, had been given\nwith a readiness and completeness which made this supposition seem\ndecidedly strained; and subsequent trials showed clearly, I think, that\nit was unnecessary, and that there had really been no irregularity. The\nobliteration of the distinction in these cases was simply due to the\nweek's lapse of time; 1 and after a longer period of 19 days, during the\ngreater part of which no experiments were made, I found that the old\n1 The period may probably vary greatly nnder different circumstances; and\nI have not yet Leen able to ascertain whether the fusion itself is the rule\nor the exception.

With 'V--II,on the other hand,\nwho ha.s been much more exercised, it happened in one ca.se that impreBl!ions\ngiven on March 22nd and revivable only lD the mutually exclusive stages on\nMarch 23rd, were fused on March 24th.\nDigi\n\f\u2022\n530 Stages of Hypnotic Memmy.\nideas, of whichever state, could all be equally and indiscriminately\nrecalled in either state A or stAte B; though in respect of more recent\nimpressions these states proved as distinct and as mutually exclusive in\ntheir memories as ever. This was a great relief to my mind, not only\nas doing away with the uncertainty which the occurrence of exceptions\nin a uniform series of results must necessarily involve, but for a wider\nreason.\nProbably all who have considered the phenomena of \"double\nconsciousness;\" or any cases where a single life has included parts of\nwhich one knows nothing of another, have asked themselves how far the\nindividual really remained the same. Mr. Myers has recently pointed\nout, as I think with perfect justice, how much less of a single and com-\nplete thing personality is than we are apt to assume, how much the\nvery idea of pers(mality depends on the sense of continuity of\nmemory, and how this f\"ct involves apparent disruption and subor-\ndinate multiplications of personality, whenever by any means the\nchain of memory is abruptly snapped. But howe\\rer much we may\nrecognise as a fact that the I of Way or of this year may fail\nto show I\\ny connection-save in the habitation of the same bodily\ntenement-with the I of yesterday or of ten years ago, we most of us\ncling, I imagine, to the notion that there is some sense in which it is still\ntrue that the two rswhich inhabit the same bodily tenement hAVe, after\nall, a sort of identity, and that their relation is fundamentally different\nfrom that between persons inhabiting different bodily tenements.\nAnd we should certainly feel it to be a justification of this notion, if\nthere came a time when the inhabitant of the one tenement could look\nback, and remember simultaneously both the dissociated states-if he\ncould in this way relate his present consciousness to each of them.\nJust as we should recognise a certain unity of personality in the fact\nthat each of the Is, though separated in all else, retained some past\nmemory in common, so should we recognise a unity in the fact that,\nthough the two had had no common element, the memories of them\nco-existed in a single consciousness. That is to say, the point of union\nmay be above the point of separation as well as below it. Now,\nwhether or not such a final fusion in memory will ever be manifested\nin those major instances of broken identity which present the personal\nproblem in an urgent form, I cannot guess; if not, then I confess that\nI see no manner in whi.h our faith in the continued identity of the\npersons concerned, or, ultimately, in our own, can be sustained. For is\nnot their case ours 71 Does the boy or the man know aught of the\nlife of the infant, who yet, we say, was he t Is not the physical change\nof death, which we must all undergo, a profounder one than any which\nJ See Mr. Myers' reDJarks above, p. 251-.

I say on a small scale; for with the\nhypnotic \"subject\" there is, of course, no question of an actual\nbreach of personality, since the backward bonds remain unbroken:\nin each of his states of mutually exclusive memory his normal waking\nlife is distinctly realised and remembered. At the same time, the\nexperiments show that a separation of impressions which appears as\ndistinct and complete as if they belonged to different individuals may\nin time, and by a spontaneous process, be dissolved away, and the two\npieces of experience may merge into the general store over which the\nmind bas unrestricted control. It would be easy to increase the gravity\nof the experiences were it worth while to afflict the \" subject's\" mind;\nhe might be told of tragic events immediately concerning himself; he\nmight even be incited to crimes and violence with real consequences of\na most serious kind. But after all, the scale of the results is of little\nimportance. It is one of the advantages of hypnotism that it con-\ndenses into a few minutes processes which it might take years of\nnormal life to parallel; and when we remember that the ideas suggested\nwere strongly impressed on the \"subject's\" mind, that they often\nsurprised him and usually elicited a string of comments, and that in\nthe other state the memory of them could not be evoked by the most\nexplicit and persevering reminders, the breach and oblivion seem to be\nas utter as any which mere course of time could bring about. Yet no\nless utterly do they disappear in the natural development of the very\ncondition out of which they arose. I do not wish to press the analogy\nof these hypnotic phenomena unduly; but if the superiority of man to\nthe brutes depends on personality, and if personality depends essentially\non memory, then those who desire that man's digni+,y should be main-\ntained, and that personality should be continuous, can hardly afford to\ndespise the smallest fact of memory which exhibits the possibilities of\nunion and comprehension as triumphing over those of disruption and\ndispersion.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f532 Oases of Hypnotic Hype'1'038tltesia.\nIX.\nNOTE ON CERTAIN REPORTED CASES OF HYPNOTIC\nHYPERlESTHESIA.\nIn an interesting paper which appears in the Revue Philosophique\nfor November last, M. Bergson of Clermont-Ferrand giVI'S an account\nof a case of supposed thought-transference or clairvoyance which turns\nout to be much more probably explicable by hypnotic hyperacuity of\nvision. The case, I think, should be noted here, for to those who ha\\'e\nsatisfied themselves that transmission of thought does sometimes occur it\nis specially important to sift away all the spurious cases which, while\napparently supporting, must in tile end discredit the novel theory.\nBriefly, then, MM. Bergson and Robinet found that a boy, who was\nsupposed to be a clairvoyant, or a telepathic percipient, could read\nfigures and words under the following conditions. One of the observers\nhypnotised the boy, stood with his back nearly against the light, opened\na book at random, held it nearly vertically facing himself, at about four\ninches from his own eyes, but below him, and looked sometimes at the\npage and sometimes into the boy's eyes. The book had often to be\nslightly shifted; but ultimately the boy could generally read the number\nof the page. Asked where he saw it, he pointed to the back of the\nbook, just opposite the number's true position. Asked where the bind-\ning of the book was, he put his hand underneath the book, and indicated\nthe place where the binding would have been, had the book faced him.\nIt occurred to M. Bergson-and he deserves full credit for being the\nfirst to insist on tliis precaution-that, small though the figures were,\ntile boy might really be reading them as reflected on the cornea of the\nhypnotiser. Experiments with slightly altered position showed that in\nfact the boy could not read the letters unless adjustment and illumination\nwere carefully made as favourable as possible. The letters were 3mm.\nin height,-nothing is said of their thickness,-and their corneal image\nwould be about O\u00b7Imm. in height, as M. Bergson computes, under the\nconditions employed. This seems a very small image to see distinctly;\nbut Mr. J. N. Langley and Mr. H. E. Wingfield, who have kindly tried\nsome careful experiments to test this point, inform me that they can\nread on each other's cornele the corneal im(l.ge of printed letters of about\nIOmm. in height. We know from Binet and Fer~'s experiments, &0.,\nhow greatly the hypnotic state does sometimes increase acuity of vision;\nand we may, I think, conclude that the boy probably did read the letters\non his hypnotiser's cornea.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fOases of Hypnotic Hyperresthesia. 533\nWhat, then, are we to make of the boy's statement that he saw the\nwords as though in a book facing him 1 M. Bergson,feels sure that this\nwas the boy's real belief. There was no suspicion of charlatanism, and\nin fact the boy disliked the experiments, and now, as M. Bergson writes\nto me, refuses to renew them. M. Bergson supposes,and I think justly,\nthat this was a case of simulation inconscieme; the hypnotised subject\ngenuinely referring his sensations to the source to which his fir,t\nhypnotiser (a believer in thought-transference) had suggested to him\nthat they were due.\nAnd, in fact, this unconscious simulation which leads the subject to\nrefer his unusual sensations to the special cause which his hypnotiser,\nor Some caprice of his own mind, suggests, is a not uncommon and a\nvery interesting phenomenon. It was observed, for instance, by\nElliotson, who pointed out a good many hypnotic peculiarities\nwhich his successors are now gradually rediscovering. It is a\nhypnotic ezaggeration of a familiar phenomenon, namely, of the\nlarge infusion of erroneous inference which we most of us import\ninto the account which we render to ourselves of our ordinary\nsensations.\nA particularly curious case is briefly described in the Journal oj\nthe Societylor P'1lchical ReBeM'ch, June, 1884. A man was brought to\nus who, when hypnotised, could often name cards held in front of him,\nalthough his eyes had been plastered up and bandaged in a most\nelaborate way. The man's friends took this for clairvoyance, and the\nman assented, being sure that he could not see the cards in the usual\nway. They\" flashed upon him,\" as he said. Now, after a good deal\nof puzzling over the case, Mr. R. Hodgson found that he also could\nsometimes manage to see over similar bandages, through small chinks\nbetween the skin and the paper gummed over the eyes. But he, too,\nfound that he saw fitfully, the power of vision seeming to come and\ngo,-and he actually could not tell with which eye he was seeing,\nexcept by covering each eye in turn with his hand. The distorted\nposition of the eyeball, and the minute and oddly-placed channels of\nvision, produced 80 much confusion that there seemed no reason to\nsuppose that the hypnotised subject's belief that he was seeing \"clair-\nvoyantly\" was other than genuine.\nThe case of M. Bergson's boy seems to have been a similar one.\nAnd his idea that he was reading from the book seems to have been a\nsort of compromise between the feeling that he was reading ,omewher6\nand the hypnotiser's suggestion that the words were being transferred\nsupemormally from mind to mind.\nThus far, then, M. Bergson's narration and explanation seem\ncredible enough, and his argument as against thought-transference in\nthis boy's case seems well made out. But he proceeded ~furthtp\"\nDigitized by ~qp81e\n\f53~ Casu 0\/ HY'fYMtic H'!JP6'1'CB8theaia.\nexperiments which, as recounted, seem incredible, and which may lead\nlOme readers to distrust the accuracy of the whole series.\nTo explain the difficulty, I must first point out that the word\nhypenesthesia is loosely used for three different classes of phenomena.\nIt is used (1) for an exaggeration of the familiar action of specialised\norgans, as when the eye is sensible to very small amounts of light. It\nis used (2) for alleged perceptions, which would imply a specialisation\nof what I may term our und,ijferentiated fund of nervou.9 sensibility in\nnovel directions. Sensibility to the action of magnets, of metals in\ncontact, of medicaments at a distance, mayor may not exist, but\nshould scarcely be called by the same name as (say) the eye's extra\nsensitiveness to light. And again, the word is used (3) for cases where\nour non-specialised organs are credited with performing functions\nwhich, 80 far as we can see, demand a. definite sense-specialisation, or\nour specialised organs are credited with functions which, on measurable\nanatomical grounds, a.ppear to overpass the limits of their specialisation.\nThis last class of cases must be received with extreme caution.\nWell, M. Bergson says that he showed the boy a microscopic.\nphotograph of 12 men, its longest diameter 2mm., and that the boy\nsaw and imitated the attitude of each man. Also that he showed the\nboy a microscopic preparation, involving cells not greater than \u00b706mm.\nin diameter, and that the boy saw and drew these cells.\nNow I might, in the first place, object that thought-transference\nwas not formally excluded, since M. Bergson himself knew the\nphotograph and the look of the cells. I do not press this, for the other\nexperiments seem to me to negative thought-transference in this case.\nI merely point out that if we wish to prove that a subject does not\nreceive an image from our minds we should present to him an object\nwith which we are ourselves unacquainted.\nBut the real difficulty is as regards the minimum msibile. It is\nusually (though not universally) supposed that in order to produce a\ndefinite image more than one retinal rod or cone must be stimulated; and\nthat consequently no objectcan be separately discernible which does not\nsubtend (say) an angle of 60 seconds, or whose retinal image is less\nthan (say) \u00b7004mm. in diameter. Floating particles, none of them\nexceeding \u00b70029mm. in diameter, have, I believe, been seen as a cloud\nin a ray of electric light sent through a tube of filtered air, but have\nnever been seen s6p(J\/f'(J,f,6l'!J by the naked eye.\nNow, the retinal image of an object itself only \u00b706mm. in diameter,\nand placed within the range of distinct vision, will be much less than\n\u00b7004mm. in diameter. To bring it up to this minimum the retinal\nimage must be n of the size of the object itself; and this implies a\nnearness to the eye involving mere darkness and blur. The microscopic\nslide was presumably transparent; but nothing was said as to the\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fCases of Hypnotic HyperOOBthesia. 535\ntransparency of the plwtograph, and yet the points distinctly visible on\nthe photograph must have been even smaller than the cells on the slide.\nA letter with which M. Bergson has favoured me has done much to\nremove these difficultie'3. It seems that the photograph was transparent,\nand that the boy held it close to his eye. Moreover, after seeing the\nphotograph the boy could not read ordinary print. \" C'est trop grand,\"\nhe said; and it was some time before the eye (which M. Bergson\nbelieves to have been always myopic) resumed its normal state.\nIt seems, then, conceivable that hypnotic suggestion had induced\n(by spasm of the ciliary muscle ') some change in the shape of the\ncrystalline lens, which made the eye a microscope for the time\nbeing. Mr. George Wherry has kindly communicaW to me two some-\nw ha.t analogous cases, where ciliary spasm (itself induced by microscopic\nor telescopic work) led to uniocular diplopia, in one case even triplopia.\nIn these cases irregular ciliary spasm apparently turned the lens into a\nkind of multiplying glass :-is it possible that M. Bergson induced a\nregular ciliary spasm, which turned the lens into a magnifier 1\nTurning back to the question with which we started, the possibility\nof a hypenesthetic explanation of cases of supposed telepathy, I must\nadd that I earnestly hope that the experiments recorded in Phantasms\nqf the Living may receive careful criticism from this point of view.\nFew, if any of them, will, I think, be found explicable by the cornea-\nreading discussed above, but there may be other sources of error which\nhave escaped our care. Yet in the hands of some critics hyperresthesia\nitself assumes attributes almost magical. In the Revue Philosopl.ique\nfor December, 1886, Dr. Ruault maintains that he and others have\nfrequently sent subjects to sleep\" by an effort of will \" in an adjoining\nroom; but that the real cause of the sleep was the suggestion given by\nthe changed sound accompl}nying the hypnotiser's quickened circulation,\nwhich the subject hears through the wall. This is meant, it seems, to\napply to the Havre case, now well known, of sommeil adistance, where\nDr. Gibert or M. Pierre Janet can throw Mme. B. into the hypnotic\ntrance, \" by an effort of will,\" from their houses to hers.l Yet I\nconfess that, whatever may be the true meaning of this curious history,\nI find it hard to believe that a peasant woman is sent to sleep by \"the\nsound of a going\" in the arteries of an elderly physician, at a distance\nof half a mile.\nSince the above note was printed in Mind for Jan. 1887, some\nfurther experiments have been reported which may be noticed\nhere as bearing more or less directly on the same problem-the\n1 An account of this case will be found in the Proceeding' of the S.P.R.,\nPart X., Art. .. Telepathic Hypnotism.\"\nDigi 2 N 2\n\f536 Oases of Hypnotic Hyp(!)T'(JJ8thuia.\nsufficiency or otherwise of the ordinary senses to explain certain\nresults noted in hypnotic hypel'lllSthesia. The hypenesthesia of\nspecialised sense-organs falls roughly into four divisions, as con-\ncerned with sight, hearing, smell (including taste), and touch-\nwhich, as here used, is the vaguest of the four categories. As regards\nsmell, there seems no assignable limit which we can pronounce Gpriori\nthat hypel'lllSthesia can never transcend. We have, that is to say, no\ndistinct knowledge either as to the diffusibility of odorous particles, or\nas to the existence of odorous differences between objects not normally\nthus distinguishable by man. As regards hearing, our limit is more\nnearly calculable, for it depends on sound-waves, of which more is\nknown j but nevertheless it is hard to say at what distance, for instance,\na hypel'&lsthetic patient may disentangle her physician's step from the\nconfused noises of the street. As regards sight, we may have difficulties\narising from minuteness, from darkness, or from interposition of opaque\nobjects. The difficulty of distance may be said to be compounded of\nminuteness and defect in light. The question of minuteness has already\nbeen touched on in Dr. Bergson's case. As to darknus, we may be pre-\npared for an almost indefinite increase in retinal excitability, and for\na considerable increase in the pupil's dilatation. The interposition oJ\nopaque objects seems at first sight to be a very definite obstacle. I\nwi)) now, however, cite a case as to which it is not easy to form a\ndecided opinion j-unless, indeed, we ascribe the coincidence to chance\nalone.\nThe case was published by Dr. Sauvaire in the RfJ1JU6 Philosophique\nfor March, 1887. Mlle. S., a healthy girl, was hypnotised for the first\ntime. It was suggested to her that there was & portrait on the back of\na certain card (apparently the king of clubs), and that she would still\nsee the portrait when awakened. She was awakened and recognised the\nportrait on the back of the same card, jumbied in the pa.ck. This, of\ncourse, was not specially remarkable, on the theory that some tri1ling\nspeck or crease affords a point de repere which enables the eyesight,\nstimulated by hypnotic suggestion, to recognise a card on which for\nother persons no mark is visible. But there was more than this. Another\npack of cards, which the young lady had never touched, was pls.ced before\nher, face downwards. She passed them through her hands, apparently,\nwithout turning any of them up, and as she did so she recognised\nanother copy of the imaginary portrait, on the back of one of the new\ncards. The card was turned up, and proved to be the king of clubs-to\ncorrespond, that is to say, with the card in the first pack on whose\nback the hallucinatory portrait had originally been suggested.\nDr. Sauvaire suggests that she saw through the card, as it lay on\nthe table, as we should see through it if we held it up to the light.\nSuch an hypothesis would need strong confirmation. :u the rpgnition\nDigitized by (;008le\n\fOa8eB of Hypnotic Hype'NUthesia. 537\nwas really due to hypel'lBllthesia, and was not merely a chance\ncoincidence, it may be suggested that the face of one card\nadheres to the back of the next in differing degrees according to\nthe amount of paint on the card, and that a delicate sense of friction\nmay have been oalled into play. It has, indeed, often been suggested\nthat hypel'lBllthetic subjects can see through the imperfectly opaque\neyelids, and through the imperfectly opaque bandages applied thereto ;\nbut in such cases there has usually been strong light shining through\nthe bandages, while in Dr. Sauvaire's case it would seem that the\ncard's face was recognised while \/;ying on the table, a feat more difficult\nto imagine. Efforts should, of course, be made to repeat the experiment.\nSomewhat different is an experiment recorded by M. de Rocha&,1\non his familiar subject Benoit, an office-clerk, whose extraordinary\nsuggestibility I have myself witnessed at Blois.\n.. I give to Benoit,\" he says, .. a piece of cardboard, with the sug-\ngestion that it is a mirror. He looks at himself, arranges his hair, and\nhis cravat.\" (This, of course, is mere acceptance of the suggestion.) \"I\nplace a real mirror behind him in such a position that the reflection\nfrom it falls on the card; he SOO8 the back of his head; I put my finger\nagainst the mirror behind his head; he recognises my finger; I place my\nwatch in the same place and tum it several times; he sees sometimes\ngold, sometimes something white (the watch-face), but without being\nable to say exactly what the object is.\"\nIt is difficult, I think, to suppose that reflections from the cardboard\nsurface, imperceptible to the normal observer, really existed, and were\nreally discerned by the subject. And it seems possible that in this\nexperiment a shadow of M. de Rochas' finger may havA been thrown\nby the real mirror on to the card, and the yellow and white light may\nhave been alternately reflected on to it from the shining surface of\nthe watch; while Benoit may have seen the back of his head, as\nwell as his face, owing to suggestion. But if the experiments could\nbe successfully repeated in such a way as absolutely to exclude such\nexplanations as these, the results might be very interesting.\nDr. Taguet, of Bordeaux, had a few years ago a patient who was\nsaid to read words held up behind her back, and reflected on a card in\nfront of her. Dr. Myers went to see this patient in the ABile des\nAlit!n~ at Bordeaux, in February, 1885, but at the time when he saw\nher she did not p0BBeB8 the power, and I have noticed no further\naccount of her since that date.\nM. de Rochas gives another case which, so far as it goes, recalls\nsome old experiments of Townshend's. He believes (p. 283) that he\nrendered certain subjects by suggestion so sensitive to small degrees of\n1 Lu Forcu 'lWn ~jiniu, p. 213. (Paris, Masson, 1887\u00b7)C I\nDigitized by oog e\n\f538 Oases of Hypnotic Hyperresthe8ia.\nlight that they recognised one another, when near at hand, in a room\nthoroughly d&rkened for Reichenbach's experiments on the alleged\nmagnetic flames. The experiment is insufficiently described. ; but here.\ntoo, is a line for further trial ; and in this case the sensitiveness of the\ndry plate might perhaps be utilised to give a precise measure of the\ndegree of hypera!Sthesia attained.\nAnother experiment of M. de Rochas', on auditory hypenesthesi~\nthough plainly inconclusive as it stands, presents matter for reflection.\nHe rendered Benoit completely deaf by suggestion, contl'actured one of\nthe boy's arms, and then found that when he spoke at the end of this\narm, or indeed when touching any part of the boy's body, the voice\nwas heard. It is obvious that this may probably have been the mere\nresult of a suggestion unconsciously given to the subject that he tDa8\nto hear under these conditions.\nThe question, however, is not so simple as it looks. It is possible,\nthat is to say, that the suggestion to Mar may have acted in a some-\nwhat roundabout manner, may in BOme way have changed the condition\nof arm or body as well as of ear. Compare an experiment already\ngiven in these Proceeding8, where Mr. Gurney shouted continuously\ninto the ear of the subject, who was entranced; while the subject, on\nhis part, did not apparently hear Mr. Gurney at all, but was aware of\nthe lightest whisper uttered by his mesmeriser, Mr. G. A. Smith, who\nstood at a distance. Such a case may be explicable either by\nthought-transference or by what I have elsewhere termed 8electit:>6\nhigperrestllaia. It may have been analogous to \"silent willing,\"\nthe utterance of the whisper forming no essential element in the trans-\nference of the idea, or there may have been suggested hypenestbesia to\nBOunds made by Mr. Smith, combined with suggested anresthesia to\nBOunds made by ail other persons.\nThis possibility of combining hypera!Sthesia and anresthesia-\nlocalised nervous stimulus with localised nervous inhibition-offers one\nof the most hopeful avenues of hypnotic experiment. It enables us to\niBOlate certain forms of sensibility and to observe them with much less\nthan usual of the disturbing interruption of sensibilities on which\nwe are not experimenting. Suggestions, moreover, directed to the\ninternal viscera (which have, thus far, been inspired almost exclusively\nby a therapeutic aim), may be BO arranged as to throw light on the\nworking of special drugs. It would be interesting to see how f&r the\nviscera could take up, so to say, a suggestion to feel the action of a drug\nof whose nature the subject himself was not aware. It is possible that the\naction of minute doses might be thus discerned hypera!Sthetically, and\nthat such action might present instructi~e points of difference from the\neffect of the same drug in ordinary doses.\nSuch, then, are BOme of the problems which may be worked at, as\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fOases of HY'JYMtic HyperaJ8thesia. 539\nit seems to me, on a suitable subject with good prospect of gaining real\ninstruction. I bring them forward here because it would seem that\nsuitable subjects are now being found in France, and because the\nexperiments on hypenesthesia thus far reported have been for the most\npart so unsystematic as to be nearly useless.\nIt is a strange and disappointing fact that for many years past, and\nnotably since 1883, when the subject of mesmerism or hypnotism was\nfirst broached in these ProrMdingB, so little work should have been\ndone in England in this direction. Beyond the experiments, scantier\ntha.n could be wished, which the writers in these ProceedingB have\nthemselves been able to watch or to perform, there has been scarcely\nanything published in English since that date which has demanded\nnotice. In France, on the other hand, so much has been done that\nthe mere report and discuBBion of French experiments has formed a great\npart of our own task. This difference is largely due to the marked\nsuperiority of the French over the English as hypnotic subjects;\na.pparently a racial difference which no effort of ours can nullify. Yet\nI cannot help suspecting that more of enterprise, more of familiarity\nwith foreign work, on the part of the staffs of our own hospitals, might\nlead to the discovery of some of those fortunate subjects, \"the frogs of\nthe psycho-physiologist,\" whose special sensitiveness might teach us\nlessons all the more valuable becauseattaina.ble without injury-or with\npositive benefit-to the subjects themselves.\nFREDERIO W.

For one who wishes to\ngain a. rapid, and at the same time a tolerably complete, view of the\nposition of hypnotism in France, MM. Binet and Fere's treatise\nwould form the complement to the two recent and equally excellent\nproductions of the Nancy school, Dr. Bernheim's De la Suggutim&., and\nProfessor &aunis' Le Somnambulilme PrO'lJOfJUE. The Parisian book\nhas naturally a strong Parisian flavour. For scientific purposes Paris\nis the centre of the earth; for hypnotic purposes the Hospice de la\nBal~triere is the centre of Paris; consequently any form of hypnotism\nspecially connected with that Hospice is necessarily \"Le Grand\nHypnotisme \"-broken reflections of which may be found, as \"formell\nfnutu,\" in Nancy, Germany, England, and other places. But a.fter all,\nthis is mainly a question of name and classification. The great thing\nis to get all the phenomena competently observed, wherever they occur.\nOur authors expressly state in their preface that their work is the\nproduct of a school-or of the school, as disciples of Dr. Charcot very\nnaturally hold; and they have done their work of observation and ex-\nposition so well that we may all be glad to be enrolled as their and his\nscholars.\nYet a word of warning seems needed, with respect to the unique\nimportance claimed by them for the pronounced phyrical phenomena\nof hypnotism; since to grant that claim in ita full extent would not\nonly cast doubt on scientific results which I do not gather that they\nthemselves really question,l but would involve a most seriOUil\ncircumscription of the most promising of all fields of psychologiCll\ninquiry. They contend-and with justice-that the more remarkahle\nphysical features of hypnotic trance are objective and unmistakeab:e;\nthat these afford a test of the genuineness of the condition which the\nrawest sceptic cannot call in question. Now in the infancy of the subject\nsuch a test is, of course, of great importance. It was a physical feature\n-the inability to open the eyes-which led Braid to his first epoch-\n1 See 8llpecially their remarks OD the work of Dr. Lij\u00a7beault, p. 57.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fBinet et Fbe, Le Magnetisme .Animal. 541\nUlalring studies; and the serene immobility which Esdaile's patients and\nothers exhibited a generation ago, when their limbs were being amputated\nor large tumours excised during hypnotic trance, marked another epoch\nof scarcely less importance. Since, however, it is possible to simulate\ninability to open the eyes, and since influential medical critics opined\nthat serene immobility under the amputating knife was simply the ma.rk\nof the\" hardened impostor,\" it is satisfactory to have a number of more\nobjective proofs accumulated. But it is one thing to see this, and to\nadmit, besides, the high interest for the physiologist of the specialities\nobserved at the Salpatriere; and another thing to identify the whole\nscientific character of hypnotism, as matter of precise and verifiable\nobservation, with the cases where those specialities are found. The\nstartling objective tests still have their use; they overbear otherwise\ninvincible prejudice; and if there were only a dozen hypnotic \"subjects\"\nin the world, they might be indispensable. But experimental research\nhas now advanced far beyond the point where the theory of simulation\ncould be sweepingly applied by any intelligent critic-it would be\nnearly as rational to suppose that everyone who complained of stomach-\nache or neuralgia was shamming, on the ground that these complaints\nare capable of being shammed. Hypnotic science would be a reality,\nand its palmary interest would remain, if there were not a single\nhystero-epileptic patient in the world. We find plenty of healthy\npersons who exhibit even the bodily signs in a quite unmistakeable\nform. The muscular condition which enables an ordinal\"Y \"subject\"\nto hold his arm extended for many minutes without the usual\nphysiological signs of fatigue, or, supported on two chairs by head and\nfeet alone, to support a heavy weight for a prolonged period, are\nsufficiently beyond simulation; and the same may be said, taking the\nphenomena en maBse, of the smiling endurance of severe bodily\ninflictions, of the failure of boys withont pocket-money to pick up\nsovereigns which they might have for the stooping, and many other\nsimilar eccentricities. Even the characteristic up-rolling of the ey~\nballs, if simulated, would imply nothing IE1BB than a world-wide\nconspiracy. But we might exclude bodily symptoms altogether, and the\ncumulative proof, arising from the ever-growing improbability that\nhundreds of persons in hundreds of places, guiltless of theories and\nunacquainted with one another, could build up by their several\nacts of conscious 01\" unconscious deceit a large and consistent body of\npsychological results, would still remain as complete as that afforded\nby the most inimitable phenomena of plastic, rigid, or irritable\nmuscles.\nEven so, our authors might urge--and in fact they have urged-that\nthe best material for scientific study is the perfect type, and that then\ndeviations and rudimentary forms can be readily understood. But this\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f542 Oritical Notice8.\nplea has not really more force than the other. It is significant that the\naccepted French name for a hypnotic .. subject\" is la fIUIlade. But\nhypnotism is not a disease, though it is often a remedy; and & picked\nmalade of the Salpetriere presents a no more perfect type-may indeed\npresent a much less perfect type-of the psychological peculiarities\nconnected with the state, than many a healthy man or woman, who on\nphysical grounds might fall short of the dignity even of a\/orme fnuu.\nNor have the physical peculiarities, so far, in either their developed or\ntheir rudimentary forms, thrown any light whatever on the psychical ;\nso that the view which our authors put forward, that to pass from the\nformer to the latter is to follow the rule of Descartes and pass from\nthe simple to the complex, specious as it looks, has in reality little\nmeaning. They do not themselves attempt to make any such\ntransition.\nThe substantial value of the work is, however, quite independent\nof these considerations. If the Paris specialities are somewhat of a\nluxury, we none the less want to know all about them; and this book\nsupplies the want without being by any means a mere monograph.\nIt opens with a bird's-eye view of the hundred years' history of\n\"animal magnetism,\" from the baquet of Mesmer to the establishment\nof the trois teats by Charcot. One is surprised to find no mention of\nEsdaile, certainly the most important figure in mesmeric history\nbetween Braid and Liebeault; but on the whole this rapid epitome is\nexcellent. The tentative advance of skilled observation and methodical\nthought into the domain of marvels so strangely opened up by\ncharlatans and amateur healers is graphically presented; and the\nwriters show their superiority to ordinary scientific prejudice by\nadmitting that in this domain, as in others, scientific methods may\nsometimes reveal marvels as well as explode them. It is significant to\nfind the subject of thought-transference (which, by the way, was\nbrought to the front in England some years earlier than our authors\nrepresent) treated with reserve and respect-for the first time,\nperhaps, in any book of scientific pretensions, written without professed\nbelief in the reality of the phenomenon. Here, however, I must\nagain venture some brief comment in respect of two of the\ncriticisms made.\nReferring to the results and arguments in M. Richet's well-known\npaper of December, 1884, which introduced the subject to French\nscience, our authors object that \"the calculus of probabilities is not\nadapted to decide a question of this nature.\" This is true in a sense-\nin the same sense in which it would be true to say that an examination\nof 110 man's heart is not adapted to decide the question whether or not\nhe is in sound health. The man's heart may be all right, but his lungs\nor liver may be out of order: so results of 8oi-diBant \"psychical\"\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fBinet et Fbe, Le Magnetisme Animal. 543\nexperiments may far surpass anything that the calculus would allow\nus to attribute to chance, but may still be due to something other than\nthought-transference-namely, to deliberate fraud, or to unconscious\ninterpretation of physical signs. But if the physician discovers that\nall the other organs of his patient's body are sound, then an\nexamination of the heart is eminently adapted to decide the question\nof health-we can guess what a Life-Assurance Company would say of a\nphysician who gave his certificate without it. And in the same way,\nwhen the hypotheses of fraud and of unconscious physical signs are\nexcluded-the first by the character of the expElrimenters, the second\nby the conditions of the experimen~the examination of probabilities,\nand in cases which admit of numerical measurement the application of\nthe calculus of probabilities, is not only adapted to decide the question\not thought-transference, but is the one indispensable means of deciding\nit. The issue being left clear between thought-transference and chance,\nthe experimenter who should neglect to take account of chance would\nbe on a par with the physician who forgot that his patient had\na heart.\nThe other item of criticism on this subject is a.tniably meant, but\nnone the less must be strongly demurred to. A sort of excuse is made\nfor thought-transference ana its advocates, in the last resort, on the\nground that, however wrong the hypothesis may be, the facts which have\nled to it are likely to prove interesting physiological curiosities,\nshowing the degree to which thought can betray itself by physical\nsigns--as by rudimentary movements of the muscles of articulation,\nand by changes in the vascular and secretive systems. General\nsuggestions of this sort are misleading, inasmuch as they have no\nrelation to the evidence on which the hypothesis really rests. How-\never\" externally visible\" people's thoughts may habitually be through\nunconscious movements of their lips or larynx, they cannot be thus\nvisible to those who do not use their eyes to see them; and however\nmuch aware \"subjects notoriously endowed with sensorial hyper-\nexcitability\" may be of \"thermic or secretory modifications\" in their\nown bodies, it remains to be explained how the thermic or secretory\nmodifications of some one else's body should reveal to them whether\nhe is thinking of the two of clubs or of the five of diamonds.\nThe historical chapter is followed by an account of the various\nmeans by which hypnotic trance may be produced. On this there is\nnot much to remark. The authors point out, as I think with justice,\nthat the analogy of hypnotic to ordinary physiological sleep must not\nbe pressed; though they somewhat detract from the strength of their\nown position by a theory that all hypnogenetic processes act by nervous\nfatigue. The ultimate nervous events involved are really as unknown\nto us now as they were in the time of Braid; and the key, e.g., to\nizedbyGoogle\n\fOritical Notices.\nmany cases of hypnotiaation by suggestion, or to Dr. Pitres' rapid\nentrancementa by pressure of special areas of the body, seems no Dlore\nlikely to be found in\" fatigue\" than in \"instability,\" or \" hypertrophy,\"\nor \"congestion.\" or other suppoaa.ble conditions. Even in C&SeI\nwhere the means of entrancement is suggestive of fatigue, a difficulty\nwould often remain in co~ecting the means with the result-which,\nas I have pointed out before (Proceedingll, Vol. II., pp. 272-4), is often\nnot a dulling, but a special alertness and mobility, of mental life. On\nthe whole, however, our authors keep commendably free from premature\nor fanciful theories j and the emphasis which they have given to the\nphysical aspecta and forms of hypnogeny is, I think, the right\ncorrective to the tendency of the Nancy school to recognise no other\nagency than suggestion. 1\nThe exposition now proceeds to the actual phenomena. of trance ;\nand here we have naturally a predominance of physiological detail The\npeculiarities of muscle, tendon and nerve, observed in hysterical\n\"subjects,\" and the \"three states\" of lethargy, catalepsy, and\nsomnambulism, are clearly described and illustrated. I find here little\nmatter for special comment, but three remarks suggest themselves. (1)\nSpeaking of muscular contractures due to \"lethargic\" hyper-excita-\nbility, the authors state that even when the excitation is applied to the\nbody of a muscle, the contracture is re~i.e., is produced by the\nascent of a nervous current to the brain and a re-descent by the motor\nnerves j and they regard this as proved by the fact that contracture of\none sterno-mastoid muscle, which turns the head to one side, can be\ncorrected by excitation of the other-this being \" a sort of interference\nwhich has no seat except in the nervous centres.\" Surely the proof is\nrather a lame one. If I can tum a person's head to the right by\npulling the right ear, and bring it back to ita normal position by pulling\nthe left ear, without setting up any interference in his nervous centres,\nwhy should not his own mechanically stimulated muscles do the like t\n(2) In the account of these lethargic contractures (p. 83). it is stated\nthat \" under the influence of continuous traction, the contractured limb\nyields by degrees, like one which has been made rigid by an act of will.\"\nIt is puzzling, therefore, to find (p. 98) this effect of continuous traction\nincluded among the physical signs which are \" guarantees against aimuJa.\ntion.\" (3) We are told (p. 92) that when a hallucination is imposed on\na \" subject\" in c'.lotalepsy, the fixed attitude of the limbs\" gives place\nto complex co-ordinated movements, harmonising with the idea\n1 See, for instance, the remarks (pp. 128\u00b79) on the production of paralysis\nof the arm (1) by 8uggestion of the idea, (2) by the application of a vibratiDg\ndiapason to certain points on the head. An identical result is produced in one\ncase by pBYchical (which of course means psycho-physical), inthe other by pnrely\nphytlical, means.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fBinet et Fbe, Le Magnttisrne .Animal. 545\nsuggested.\" This is very interesting; and if I lived at Nancy, I should\ncertainly fasten on the fact, as a strong support to the view that the\ncataleptic fixity itself is really, in a way, the result of suggestion-that\nthere is a true psychica.l obedience, and not merely an idiopathic physical\nsymptom, in the retention of the impressed attitudes.\nPassing now to admitted psychica.l features, we have the main\npeculiarities-sensory anresthesia. and hypenesthesia., extreme retentive-\nn.ess of memory, extending to remote facts of normal life, general\noblivion on waking, rapport with the hypnotiser, &c., &c.-presented\n-with judicious comments. Some of the statements border on the\nIDarvellous. A hypnotised girl recognises and names a doctor with\n-whom her only connection was that at the age of two she had been an\ninmate of an institution where he visited. \"Selective sensibility\" some-\ntimes reaches such a pitch that the patient can identify \"each one of\na. thousand operators,\" and sometimes \"can recognise their touch through\nbis clothes.\" Very curious, too, are the accounts of divided rapport,\nthe \"subject\" welcoming A's touch on the right side and B's on the\nleft, while resenting and resisting A's touch on the left and B's on\nthe right; 1 and actually re8f\\rving her right eye for hallucinations\nimposed by A and her left for those imposed by B. In hypnotism\nstranger things than this may yet be true. But as regards hypnotic\n'l\"apport in general, I cannot think that it is rightly represented (pp. 110\nand 133) as a mere exaggerated form ofthe normal attraction which one\nperson often exercises on another. As a rule, of course, a person would\nnot submit to be hypnotised, leas!; of all frequently, by anyone whose\nmanner or person they objected to; but there are quite enough cases to\nprove that personal dread and aversion form no barrier to the establish-\nment of a peculiar influence which the\" subject\" in vain tries to throw\noft'. On the subject of memory, I need only remark that our authors\nseem to have too readily admitted the view that the events and ideas\nof the trance can always be recalled, on waking, by appropriate\nsuggestions. I have explained above (p. 281) my dissent from M.\nDelbaluf on this head. As far as a study of the literature and my own\nhumble dealings with formes frustes enable me to judge, the revivable\nmemory is the exception rather than the rule, if any but the lightest\nstage of trance has been induced.\nThe next chapter consists chiefly of a rescript of Dr. Charcot's\nclassica.l essay (Compte8 rmdm de l'Academie des Sci6ncea, 1882) de-\n1 Through the kindness of M. Fa-e, Mr. Myers and I witnessed this\nphenomenon as exhibited by II 1& nomm~e Wit \u2022 \u2022 .\" in August, 1885.

Nor is it easy (may I\nsuggest ') even for a taciturn Northerner to preserve absolute silence\nfor several minutes together, when keenly interested in what he is\nobserving. These remarks are not made in any cavilling spirit; it is\nvery far from my wish to question the care and sagacity of Dr. Charcot\nand his pupils. But it would be a legitimate satisfaction to those who\nlive in a country where hystero-epilepsy is comparatively infrequent.,\nand who have no opportunity for direct observation, if the full details\nof a few crucial experiments-carried out with quite new patients\nand if possible outside the walls of the Salpetriere--could be given to\nthe world. A similar. remark applies to a topic which occurs inci-\ndentally in the chapter under review, and becomes much more\nprominent later in the book-the influence of a magnet on patients\nwho are unaware of its proximity. That a magnet abould produce\ndistinct physical effects on the human organism is, if true, one of the\nmost remarkable facts of modern science. It is a fact which French\n,avants of repute assert as a matter of quite ordinary experience; yet\nprobably not half-&-dozen physicians or physiologists out of France\nhave either witnessed it or believe in its reality. Some years ago a com-\nmittee of our own Society published BOme results which pointed strongly\nin this direction (Proceeding', Vol. I., p. 230, and Vol. II., p. 56);\nbut they were too few and uncertain in their occurrence to ndmit of\npositive conclusions. With the French results it is otherwise; they\nseem indefinitely repeatable; and that being BO, the present state of\nthings--confident assertion on one side of the Ohannel, ignorant indif-\nference or incredulity on the other--seems nothing short of a scientific\nscandal. I am quite disposed to lay the blame to the account of\nEnglish torpor rather than of French precipitancy; but I cannot but\nthink that our foreign CQITI,jrere. would sooner win the insular ear if\nthey more explicitly recognised the staggering unexpectedness of the\nfacts which they smoothly recite, as well as the magnitude of the\n1 It is only fair to state that our authors themae1ves, in dealing directly\nwith the subject of suggestion, emphasise these very pointsJpp. 142-3).\nDigitized by Googie\n,I\n\fBinet et Fbi, Le Magnetisme .Animal. 547\nissues raised; and if they would make a point, as each new form of\n:magnetic effect presents itself, of placing on record crucial experiments,\nin which every condition and every guarantee should be carefully\ndetailed. It is surely too unceremonious to say, for instance, as our\nauthors do (p. 118), \" We have ascertained that, by bringing a magnet\nnear the arm of a patient in natural sleep, or near the vertex of one\nwho is in lethargy, one produces a new state, . . . in which the\nrespiration is imperceptible, the insensibility is complete, and the\nappearance that of actual death.\" Writers who are so enamoured\nof \"objective\" experiments, and so hard on results which have\nto be accepted in part on the strength of the observer's experience and\njudgment (p. 125), may surely be expected in their own records to\nle&\\\u00b7e as little as possible to be taken on trust.\nThe chapter on Suggestion, which contains much good sense,\npresents also some matter for criticism. I am glad to find the authors,\nthough they have previously seemed doubtful whether any formula can\nbe found for the psychical phenomena of hypnotism, coming more than\nonce to the very -verge of one which I have myself suggested-\n\"psychical reflex action.\" I must own, however, to sheer bewilderment\nat their attempted explanation of the \"subject's\" affection by the idea\nof something as in reality an affection by psripheral excitation, because\nforsooth an idea is built up out of remembered sensations, and \"Nihil\nest in intellectu, &c.\" This is surely carrying I'hampionship of the\nperiphery, and the war with Nancy, beyond the bounds of reason. I\npresume that Messrs. Binet and Fere, like everyone else, would speak\nof a murderer as conceiving a crime, or a hero an exploit, with his mind\nor with his brain, not with his skin or retina; and in this respect\nhypnotically-suggested ideas stand on precisely the same ground as any\nothers. The fact adduced, that certain bodily effects which can be\noriginated by suggestion can also be originated by direct physical\nstimuli (see above, p. 544, note), is wholly irrelevant; for the suggested\nidea which produces the effect is of the effect, not of the peculiar\nphysical stimulus which may produce a similar effect on another\noccasion or with another \"subject.\" The idea of a paralysed arm\nwhich paralyses an arm is not built up out of remembered\nsensations of a vibrating diapason. After this brief lapse, the account\nflows smoothly on. The various classes of suggestion are clearly\nindicated; and it is satisfactory to find that a special difficulty\nconnected with \"negative hallucinations\" is recognised. The point of\nthe difficulty, however, seems in this passage to have been missed; for\nthe effect is represented as a sort of sensory paralysis, strictly parallel\nto motor-paralysis produced by suggestion. The two things are, of\ncourse, alike in being both effects of inkibitio'n-\" un mot qui\nn'explique rien,\" as our authors trenchantly observe; but- t~mre\nDigitized by ~OVOlt::\n\f548 Critical Notices.\nBurely much more markedly unlike in fundamental character. In the\nfirst place, the arm which cannot move simply fails to do somethiDf\nwhich an act of will is normally required to bring about, whereas ~\neye that cannot see fails to do something which it normally cannot\nhelp doing; BO that the inhibition is in the one case of an occa.siona.:\naction, in the other of a continuous function. But this is not a.l.I.\nThat the idea of inability to move an arm should produce tbe inability\nis really one of the most comprehensible effects of suggestion, so far\nas anything can be called comprehensible of which the physical details\nare unknown to us; for all that happens is that the connection\nbetween a motor centreand the higher ideational centres is shut oft: Bot\nthat the idea of inability to see a particular person or object should\nproduce the inability, introduces a new and complex psychological\npuzzle. For here there is no disconnection of the optic nerve, or of\nany particular fibres of the optic nerve, from the higher centres. The\nwhole optical appara.tus retains normal activity; the invisible person\nmay occupy every portion of the field of vision in turn, and ,,-ill\neverywhere remain invisible, while every other object in the room\nis clearly seen. Clearly, then, the effect is very much more\nthan a mere sensory inhibition, parallel to the motor inhibition\nin the other case. As M. Fare himself and Professor Wi1lia.m James1\nhad rightly pointed out, the invisible thing must in a sense be sura in\norder to be not seen; it must be '1'ecogniBed as the subject of the sugges-\ntion. That is to say, perception includes it, but ignores or \"cuts\" it.\nThus the principle of association of ideas, which our authors represent\nas here completely breaking down, is truly maintained; the idea of the\nperson who it was suggested would be invisible must, in BOme obscure\nway, be represented in the mind which a.verts itself from regarding\nhim.\nIn the account of hypnotic hallucinations, the chief feature is\nnaturally that modification of imaginary visual objects by optical\ninstruments-prism, spy-glass, or mirror--on which both our authors\nhave written separately. The investigation is of great interest, if only\nas showing the remarkable hyperaesthesia and retentiveness which are\ninvolved in the observation of the real points de '1'epWe with which the\nimaginary object links, so to speak, its visible existence; but having\ndiscussed it elsewhere, 2 I need say no more of it here than that these\nspecial optical delusions seem as peculiar to \"the atmosphere of\nthe Sa.lp~triere\" as minl,ge to that of the desert. Neither normal nor\nordinaryhysterical \"subjects\" are affected bythem.

What he really did was to state the exact opposite-\nviz., that a ha.llucinatory image was to be distinguished from a real\nobject by the fact of not being so doubled. He, of course, could not\nhave said this had he known of a single case where the hallucinatory\nimage was doubled by pressure; but on the other hand I am not\naware that he ever supported his own statement by adducing a single\ncase of its Jailing to be doubled. Instances of the doubling have\nbeen credibly reported. Of further points discussed, special mention is\ndue to a very interesting series of experiments carried out by MM.\nMarie and Azoula.y (p. 176), proving the distinctly longer time which it\nrequires to perceive a hallucinatory object, when presented afresh, than\nto recognise a real one. This fact seems to show, what would naturally\nbe expected, that the recognition of the point de repere, and the imposi-\ntion on it of the imaginary figure, is a double operation. Very interest-\ning also are the observations as to the colourlessness of hallucinations\nsuggested to an achromatopic eye; the production of complementary\ncolours by hallucinatory images; the mixture of imaginary colours; and\nthe close relation between visual activity and the general sensibility of\nthe external tissues of the eye, exhibited when the visual activity is\ninduced by hallucination no less than by normal excitation.\nThe topic of esthesiogenes brings us into that region of marvels to\nwhich I have already referred-the various effects of a magnet on the\nhuman organism. \"This agent has nothing mysterious about it,\" say\nour authors ; \"it acts on the nervous system like 8 weak electric\ncurrent.\" This, of course, explains nothing; weak electric currents\nha.ve never been supposed able to affect a human body across space.\nHowever, we need not chop straws as to how far the existence of a.\nquite unguessed relation of living tissues to physica.l agencies is\n\" mysterious\"; it is at any rate a fact of surpassing interest; and\nour authors' list of precautions (p. 195) certainly conveys the impres-\nsion that they have justified their own conviction of its reality. They do\nnot perhaps exceed their rights in claiming that it would weigh nothing\nagainst the genuineness of their results if these could not be repeated\nwith other\" subjects\" ; since the peculiar sensibility in question is, for\naught they know, a peculiarity of \"les grandes hysteriques.\" But in\nview of the extraordinary susceptibility of some neurotic persons to\nsuggestion, one cannot but wish that the list of precautions included\nthe invariable employment of an electro-magnet, of which the current\ncould be turned on and off without the \"subject's\" knowledge.\nThe phenomena first described belong to the class of transfers. A\nunilateral hallucination of the eye or ear is transferred, by the applica-\ntion of a magnet, to the other side of the body; not symmetrically, hqw-\nDigitized by G\u00a7)~8le\n\f550 Critwal Notices.\neVtlr, in the visual cases-the imaginary profile which the right eye sa....\nas turned to the right is similarly seen by the left eye.1 The transfer\nis accompanied by a pain, localised, according to our authors, in a\nspecial area which may probably be the visual or the auditory. Exter-\nnal stimulation of the skull at the parts thus indicated, at a time when\nthe\" subject\" is in catalepsy, is said to restore movement to the fixed\neyes, and hearing to the deaf ears. But the more remarkable cases are\nthose where the hallucination is bi-lateral. Here, we are told, the\nproximity of the magnet annuli the hallucination. The imaginary\nobject disappears; and not only so, but a real object similarly dis-\nappears; the gong whose noise had just before struck a patient into\ncatalepsy ceases to be visible to her eyes when the magnet is held near\nher head, a.nd may then be struck again and again with ,iolence with-\nout producing any effect on her. Similarly (p. 240) an object rendered\ninvisible by suggestion becomes visible again under the induence of the\nmagnet. The same means will suppress memory in the same way, and\ncause a \"subject\" to forget the nature of an object which she has just\nbefore been correctly describing. Our authors apply to this iniluence\nof the magnet the term polarisation. But besides merely replacing an\nactivity by a paralysis, polarisation may apparently produce positive\ncomplementary results. The \"subject\" who has been gazing at an\nimaginary red cross, at the approach of the magnet begins to see green\nrays radiating from it; and gradually the green becomes all the colour\nvisible, and the red cross in the middle is replaced by a white one.\nA similar relation of polarisation to aintple transfer is described in\nthe next chapter, in the department of movements and acts. A patient\nis told to make a pied de nez at a bust of Gall with her left hand; a\nmagnet is placed near her right hand,and she is woke. She makesfourteen\npiedB de nez with her left hand; then the movement gradually ceases,\nand is taken up by the right hand. On the withdrawal of the magnet\nthe transfer is again produced, and the left hand recommences. Similarly\nthe magnet will cause a series of numbers which the \"subject\u00bb is\nwriting with the right hand to be continued with the left; and while\nthe left hand is thus employed, the right has lost all its writing faculty.\nAnd again, an order to carry out a series of actions with the one hand\nis executed throughout with the other hand, though the magnet has\nonly been in the \"subject's\" proximity at the very beginning of the\nexperiment. Polarisation paralyses the power of carrying out move-\nments with either hand.

But if the\nsuggested movement is associated with an emotion, the alleged effect is\nto produce the opposite emotion. A\" subject\" to whom it has been\nsuggested to strike the experimenter, and who has actually aimed a blow\nat him, is incited by a hidden magnet at her feet to exclaim, \"I want\nto kiss him,\" and can only be prevented from doing so by force!\nConfirmatory examples of this \"psychic polarisation,\" or reversal of\nideas and emotional impulses, have since been described by MM.\nBianchi and Sommer, in the Revue Philosophique for February, 1887,l\nFurther topics of interest in this 10th chapter are the effects of\nsuggestion in producing the \"attitudes passionelles \"; the confinement\nof suggested acts to one side of the body; the \"echo-speaking,\" which\nBerger discovered to be producible in some hypnotic\" subjects\" by the\napplication of the hand to their head or the nape of the neck; the\ndiminished reaction-time in this echo-speaking-the results here con-\nfirming the experiments of Professor Stanley Hall (Mind, VoL VIII.,\np.170)in hypnotic reaction-time in general and contrasting in an interest-\ning way with the increased time nece88&ry for distinct psychic reactions,\nsuch as the re-establishment of a hallucinatory image in its former\nplace (see p. 549 above); the independent reasoning, and often the in-\ngenuity, which\" subjects\" will often bring to bear, in or after the\nexecution of suggested acts; and the obstinacy with which suggestions\nbearing on some particular act, or class of acts, are often resisted.\n(Oompare a case which I described in Proceedings, Vol. II., p. 287.)\nAnd specially I would draw attention to a certain difference between\ncataleptic and suggested somnambulic attitudes (p. 220), which certainly\ntends to suggest, as against the Nancy view, that hypnotic\ncatalepsy is not a mere effect of suggestion. But many more experiments\nof a precise kind are wanted. I have certainly seen a \"subject's\"\nextended arm, stiffened by suggestion, tremble and drop in the way that\nour authors describe; but then the stage of trance produced was of\nthe very lightest; and there is no doubt, I think, that in some \"sug-\ngestion\" cases fatigue and its physical symptoms do not supervene\nnearly so soon as they would in normal conditions..\nThe next chapter, which takes up again the subject of sensory\nparalyses produced by suggestion, is rich in interesting facts. For\ninstance, a \"subject\" to whom a purse had been rendered invisible,\nwill equally fail to see the money which comes out of it; one to whom\na particular person had been rendered invisible could not see him for\nsome days, and then, on regaining the power to see him, took him for\na stranger visiting the hospital; one, in whom pressure of a particular\n1 See also \"Nuove Ricercbe nell' Ipnotismo,\" pel Dott.

Colours rendered invisible by sugge-stion\nare said to have been revived in memory by the proximity of a magnet.\nand they also give rise to subsequent complementary imagt'll-showing\nthat the invisible colour has affected the sensory centre in the same\nway as if it had been visible. This is a strong proof that the phy.U:al\nprocess in \"negative hallucination\" has its seat in some higher part\nof the brain than the sensory centre, and is thus in complete accordance\nwith what was said above (p. 548) as to the complexity of the accom-\npanying pBychical condition. On that point, by the way, I find myself\nno less at variance with our authors than before j for they now\ndescribe the special peculiarity of the condition in much the same\nwords as I have myself employed, yet attempt to give it a sort of ex-\nplanation by denying it any psychical side. Not only do they illustra.te\nthe fact that there must be, in a sense, recognition, and so sight, of the\ninvisible object, but they admit that in some cases this demands \"a\nvery delicate and a very complex operation, and a sustained effort of\nattention.\" The aasumption that such an act is a piece of me\"\" un-\nconscious cerebl'8.tion seems to me no very plausible substitute for the\nhypothesis, puzzling though it be, that on the mental stage recognition\nis compatible with aversion of attention.\nWe pass on in the next chapter to the effect of suggestion\nin producing motor pal'8.1yses. Here the chief points to note are\nthe general accompaniment of the paralysis by anlllBthesia j the exact\ncorrespondence of anresthetic area. with the area. of the pal'8.1ysis; the I\nf'Xaggel'8.tion of the tendon-reflexes, as in some para.lyses of organic\norigin j the increase of force in the left arm during the paralysis of the\nright, and even of skill in the left hand when some particular process, ,\nsuch as writing, is forbidden to the right (p. 256)-facts which recall\nthe alleged effects of the magnet, and are regarded by our authors as\ndue to mppleance between the two cerebra.l hemispheres j the\nproduction of aphasia in conjunction with suggested paralysis of the\nright arm, due (they hold) to the proximity of the speech-centre to the\nmotor-centre involved j paralysis with contracture caused by the ideA\nof excitation at the spot where actual pressure would produce i~.g.. I\nthe gr~ffe llthargiq!UJ following suggestion of pressure at a particular\nspot on the fore-arm. In their account of partw paralyses, which\nmerely inhibit a particular action, our authors describe an effort made\nby the patient to perform the action-flexion of the thumb-aa haling\nresulted in a violent extension. This is confirmatory of a less extreme\ncase which I described some years ago (Proceedings, Vol. II., pp. 288-9)-\nthe instant contraction of the biceps muscle in opposition to slight\nhardenings of the triceps which the\" subject\" produced, with great effort,\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fBVnet et Fbi, Le Magnitisme .Animal. 553\nwhen offered a sovereign if he would extend his arm. But the attempted\ncomparison between such opposition-effects, and the production of com-\nplementary images by colours the sight of which has been suppressed\nby suggestion, seems an unfortunate piece of ingenuity. For in the\nmotor-ca.ses we have simply nervous energy directed to a particular\nspot in the body, and taking the only alternative channel when it\nfinds the desired one closed. In the colour-cases there is no question of\nany alternative channel, and the physical process at the sensory centre-\nfatigue of certain nervous elements, or whatever it may be-is precisely\nthe same as if the colour had produced its normal effect in consciousness.\nThe true sensory parallel to the motor-cases would beif the suppression\nof a real colour produced an impression of the complementary colour\nwhich was flOt produced where there had been no suppression; for\nthen it might be conjectured that the central elements responded with\nincreased force to stimulation from the one colour through their\nenforced blindness to the other; but our authors have not recorded\nany example of such an effect.1 Of special interest are the\n\"systematic paralyses,\" where some complicated set of movements,\nsuch as those of writing, or of playing the piano, are rendered\nimpossible. The selection may be of the most arbitrary sort; for\ninstance, a \"subject\" is rendered unable to write the word non,\nthough he can write any number of other words containing the letters\nnand 0 (p. 254). Our authors represent this as an inhibition, not of\nmovements, but of co-ordination of movements. It may be suspected,\nhowever, that the caU'3e lies further back-that the motor energy is, so\nto speak, prevented at the very outset from directing itself to that par-\nticular word. The test, which does not seem to have been tried, would\nbe to set the unsuspecting \"subject\" to write a number of words\nin one of\u00b7 which the syllable non occurred. . If this word were\nwritten, the inability certainly could not be that of grouping\nthese three letters. And, in general, it seems to me that\nthe facts of systematic paralysis indicate something distinctly\nbeyond mere failure in co-ordination, and. ajO'l'tiori beyond the mere\n\" paralysis of the motor-centre,\" which a few pages later (p. 258) we\nfind represented as the \"fundamental fact\" in all these effects of\nsuggestion. It isjust here, in myview,that theparallel between the sensory\nand the motor paralyses might fairly be pressed-the physical cause in\neither case lying in a cerebral tract higher than the specific centres of\nsense or movement. Our authors, \"averting their regard\" from these\n1 Their language at this place (p. 249) would imply that they had given\nsuch lion example, the \" 8Ubject\" seeing & green square while actually\ngazing at &red one, whose colour had been suppressed; but in the experiment\nto which they must be referring (p. 235) the complementary image is described\nas COfI8IlCUU'I1e, and is just ~h&t would be produced in normal condiHog@. I\nDigitized by ~u08 e\n\f554 Oritical Notices.\nhigher tracts (without the excuse of hypnotic suggestion!) are led to\ntreat any psychical facta connected with them aa aecondary aDd\ninsignificant. Thus they end the discussion on \" paralyses of will,\" in\nthe chapter now under review, by aa.ying that it matters little whether\na person's own account of an inability is that he cannoC do the\nthing, or that he dou fIOt wUh to do it, or that he dou not\nknow how to do it; becanse all three ca.aea involve some\nfunctional disturbance of the motor-centres. So may excess alike\nof pleasure and of pain involve some functional disturbance of the\nheart. Such treatment of fundamental psychological distinctions is\nhardly of a piece with the immediately succeeding paragraphs (p. 262),\nin which the long neglect of hypnotism by psychologists is deplored,\nand its claim to a foremost place in the study of mind is strongly\nenforced.\nThe following chapter, on thetherapeutical applications of hypnotism\nand the\" medicine of the imagination,\" though eminently sensible aa far\naa it goes, is short, and ('.aIls for little comment. I must remark, how-\never, that the dogmatic assertion that\" suggestion only cures affections\nwhich are capable of being modified spontaneously, or by the influence\nof various external agents,\" seems decidedly premature. The agency\nwhich can produce a blister in a few hours-a result which our authors\naccept (p. 146), but which a few years ago scarcely any instructed\nphysiologist would have believed-is not one whose physiological limits\ncan be laid down in a single trenchant phrase.\nThe final chapter, \" Hypnotism and Responsibility,\" gives a sketch\nof the various ways in which hypnotism might come into contact with\nthe criminal law. These may be epitomised aa follows. (1) Someone\nmay profess to have been subjected to injury while in the hypnotic\ntrance-a profession which may be true, or deliberately false, or due\nto a deluded imagination, or the result of hypnotic suggestion, which\nhaa either caused him to see something which waa not fact, or to fail to\nsee something which waa fact. (2) Someone may have been subjected to\ninjury in the hypnotic trance, but, owing to post-hypnotic oblivion, may\nbe unable, ina normal state, to bear witness to the fact. (3) Someone may\nhave been instigated to commit a crime, either during the hypnotic\ntrance or afterwards, by a command impressed during trance. (4)\nSomeone may make a false confession of a crime, under the influence of\na previous hypnotic command. The difficulties and pitfalls which would\nawait the \"expert\" witness in such ca.ses are set forth with due\ncaution j and here the stress laid on the value of objective physical\nsigns, when it is a question of whether a person is hypnotisable or not,\nseems quite in place. The treatise concludes with two very\nsound principles i-that attempts to extort truth by hypnotising\nsuspected or accused persons against their will are illegitimate; and\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fDr. Gules de la, Towrette, L'HypnotiBme, &c. 555\nthat experimentation on human material must be pursued with the\nutmost caution, and must never be prostituted to the gratifica.tion of\nvulgar curiosity.\nI am sorry to part with so interesting a book. If I have seemed\nto dwell principa.lly on disputable points, this has been in some\nmeasure forced on me by the nature of my task. The authors\nthemselves expressly state that they consider the subject not ripe for\ngeneral conclusions j consequently their work contains no broad views\nor sweeping hypotheses of which a popular outline might have been\npresented at second-hand. The book is eminently one of special facts\nand special discussions j and in such a case the reviewer's most\ninstructive course seems to be to deal with points of difference--\nto criticise, in fact, rather than to seek to reproduce, and to alight\nwhere the path is tangled, rather than to retrace it where it is clear.\nThe reader who desires to master the facts in detail will naturally go to\nthe original; of many of them the account hardly admits of being\nshortened; but even a brief critical survey of the manner in which\nthey have been presented and interpreted may suggest the nature of\nthe problems involved to some who can forego the minutia! of\nmuscular contractions or complementary images. My only regret\nwould be if this treatment seemed to anyone incompatible with a\ngenuine sense of the high qualities-the ca.re, the candour, and the\ningenuity-which the work displays. Though modest alike in its form\nand in its claims, it worthily sustains the high scientific reputation of\nits authors and their school.\n'F.nMUND GURNBY.\nL'Hypnotiame et lea Beau Analogues au Point de Vue Medico-legal,\npar Ie DR. GILLBS DB LA TOURBTl'E, Preparateur du Oours de\nMedecine Legale a. la Fa.culte. Preface de M. LB DR. P.\nBROUARDBL. Paris: Libra.irie PIon, 1887.\nThat a treatise more than bOO pages long should discuss, and treat\nas a pressing need, the recognition of hypnotism by the French code,\ncertainly shows that the subject is in a very advanced stage, inasmuch\nas the law of the land is usually the very last stronghold into which a.\nnew conclusion of science forces a passage. As in all the English\nannals of mesmerism there seems to be no case betokening any necessity\nfor legislation, and as, if any danger existed, legislation in this country\ncould only be got either by a popular agitation, which is unlikely, or\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f656 Oritiool Notices.\nby an agitation of medical experts in the subject, who hardly here exist\nat all, it is fair to say that the question to which Dr. Gilles de la\nTourette volwninously devotes himself is not yet a British interest.\nOf such a question it is natural that a Frenchman should work out the\ntheoretical possibilities before the maBB of English people are alive to\nthe bare facta. Bare, indeed, the facts themselves are so far from\nbeing, that I shall have to criticise Dr. Gilles de la Tourette closely\nupon his version of them. His book is in effect, if not in purpose, &\ncounterstroke of optimism from Paris against the warnings of danger\npublished from time to time by Dr. Li~geois, of Nancy, referred to in\nMr. F. Myers' first article in Proc\u00abdi.ng. X., and beat summarised in\nthe ReVUIJ lk fHypnoti8me, No.3, p. 82, September, 1886. Another\ntreatment of the question on the same side is to be found in the first\nnumber of the same journal, by Dr. Ladame, of Geneva. A main\npurpose of Dr. de la Tourette is to re&BBure the world against the fear\nof crimes, committed in real life and out of the human laboratories of\nthe hospitals, under the in1luence of hypnotic or post-hypnotic\nsuggestion. The force of his re&BBurance depends almost entirely on \"\nproposition which he shares with the rest of the Paris school, and\nwhich vitiates, if false, nearly the whole of his optimism. Briefty\nstated, it is that all these artificially produced mental and bodily states\nare \"nevroses,\" or aa we should say, pathological: that a hypnotic\nsubject is a \"malade,\" and generally haa either hysteria or its germs,\nwhich renewed hypnotising tends to bring out; and that the phenomena\nof natural somnambulism, of hypnotism provoked on persons apparently\nrobust, and of the confessed \"n~vropathes\" of the Sal~triere, are all\nbrunches of the same fatal tree, hysteria. It would follow that the\nsymptoms and stages of hypnotism in the hysterical patients of MM.\nCharcot, Richer, Dumontpallier, and Magnin, so far aa they-imperfect\naa the agreement on them is I-are to be expected and similarly tested\nfor in the case of persons apparently robust. Now the doctor's true\nand secondary proposition, that all the cases which have yet come before\nthe French Courts have involved hysteria, is not to be confounded with\nhis untrue fundamental proposition. which sometimes appears in the\nform that\" sujets sains\" do really exist, but are to be judged by rules\nbased on the observation of \"hysteriques,\" and sometimes apparently\nin the form that hypnotism appears\" chez les seuls n~vropathes.\" The\nevidence he adduces in proof of this is worth examining aa a bad case\nof scientific prejudice. On p. 57 he quotes from Dr. Li~ult's first\nwork (p. 344), in order to confute the Nancy school out of its master's\nmouth. Dr. LieOOault says first that the bilious-nervous tempera-\n1See Soci~t~ de Biologu, 7 JaB., 1882, p. 5; and id.

Then he admits that\n\"people a.1I'ected with strabismus, quivering of eyeballs, or \u2022tics con-\nvulsifs', and vapourish women, hysterical and some epileptic people,\nnervous sufferers, and sufferers from analmia, are usually disposed to\nbecome somnambules.\" He adds to this list persons who dream and move\nabout in sleep. But the last part of the quotation from Dr. Liebeault\nruns :-\" Si 1'0n rencontre surtout des sujets aendormir parmi des\nmalades, ce n'est pas une raison pour croire que les etats de charme et\nde somnambulisme sont morbides, comme on est porte aIe penser: nous\navons endormi des femmes et des hommes d'une constitution robuste et\nqui n'avaient jamais ete souffrants, pour sinsi dire, des paysans\nvigoureux ayant servi dans des corps d'elite et fait des campagnes\npenibles sans qu'ils soient jamais entres dans un Mpital.\" Dr. de la\nTourette makes the astonishing comment: \"On nous accordera sans\nconteste que 1'0pinion de M. de Liebeault n'a rien de dejavoroole ala\nthese de la production de l'hypnotisme chez les seuls nevropathes, qui\nest celIe que nous soutenons.\" If we pass over the calculation of M.\nBottey that 30 per cent. of absolutely healthy persons can be hypnotised,\nwhich is quoted as also favourable to \"la these,\" we come to a more\nserious argument, quoted from M. Paul Janet (de I'Institut), who\nurges that though healthy persons can be hypnotised, yet hysteria. is the\nstem on which it is best to graft hypnotism, and presents it in its\nfullest, purest, most classic form. M. Janet also criticises the paucity\nof detail upon th& pa.thological history of the Nancy patients, and M.\nPaul Magnin 1 asks in wonder how the feature so well-known in the\nSa.lpetriere, and the most important symptom in detecting fraud, namely,\nthe excitability of nerves and muscles otherwise than by auggestwn, can\nhave escaped M. Bernheim's notice. Possibly the answer to this\nquestion is: \"Just because there are so many non-hysterical patients\nat Nancy. It may be true that M. Magnin has shown the presence of\nsurface and deep contractions in all three states of hysterical hypn.otism;\nbut if we cannot really argue from that to non-hysterical hypnotism, it\nwill be necessary definitely to prove hysteria. before the medical expert,\nre-hypnotising, can point to the absence of muscular contraction as an\nevidence of feigned hypnotism.\"\nOne more specimen of Dr. de la Tourette's incompleteness on this\npoint. On p. 442, he speaks of the public mesmerisers who fix on\nanmmic \"nevropathes\" in their audience to begin upon. It is a pity\nthat he has never been a witness of Mme. Card's exhibitions at\n1 Revue de l' Hypnoti8me, No.6, p. 177, in review of Dr. de 1a Tourette's\nbook.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f558 Critical Notice8.\nOxford or Cambridge. It is well known that Hansen preferred robust\nyoung students, ignorant of the existence of nerves,1 and tbat flighty\npersons of weak concentrative power are bad subjects.\nBut many English readers will be asking, \"Who would ever feign\nhypnotism at all t How does the question come before the law, and\nhow do the scientific iBBues affect the law'\" It will be most con-\nvenient to take the divisions of Dr. Ladame in the article mentioned\nabove. The first deals with the danger of the methods of hypnotising,\nespecially the violent ones practised in public shows. Dr. de la Tourette's\nmost valuable chapters deal with the \"exploitation\" of magnetism.\nThe prohibition of Donato in Italy, of Hansen in Germany, and of per-\nformers at the English Universities, shows how practical the po int is.\nNothing could better play into the hands of the believers in the\n\" nevrose\" than the deranging effect of public exhibitions undertaken\nfor commercial motives, and of private and blundering attempts by the\ninexpert. The more practised and more gentle the manipulation is,\nthe leBB of Ilo \" nevrose \" is hypnotism, and the worId can read the COD-\nfeBBions of Dr. Liebea.ult (RfJ'I.,'tUJ, NoB. 4 and 5), who has hypnotised\nthousands, and learn how slight have been his errors, and how largely\nthey vanished the more he employed gentle suggestion.\nThe next division of Ladame deals with unlawful acts committed\nspontaneously by natural somnambulists, and the sensible conclusion\nof Dr. Gilles de 180 Tourette is that they should be acquitted, but also\nwatched, as irresponsible, since they recollect their act, if at all, only\nas a dream. A more complicated difficulty arises with persons afIlicted\nwith an \"etat second.\" Are they accountable in one state for what\nthey do in another 1 Hysteria must not be reckoned to destroy\nresponsibility, or its slightest symptom would be' an excuse; but it\nwould be hard to punish a person during one ltat for the misdoings of\nhis other personality, and the utmost that can be laid at the door of\nthe patient is a limited responsibility dwring the same se<:tion of\nhis life. The case of Dr. Dufay, who by inducing artificial somnam-\nbulism found where an article had been hid in natural somnambulism,\nsuggests the grave question of what may be termed judicial re-\nhypnotising. By this is meant an effort to reproduce by new hypnotism\nthe memories of old hypnotism, in order to examine the chances of\nthe subject having been an irresponsible instrument of crime. But before\ndiscuBBing this a word is due on Dr. Ladame's third division, which deals\nwith crimes committed on hypnotised persons. Dr. de 180 Tourette has\nmany hints of value on this head, but they are too frequently based\non the assumption of a hysterica.l constitution in every possible\n1 Fischer, Da Sogenannte Leben8-MagnetiamWi (Mainz, 1883), p. 82; and\n!lee Mr. E. Hurney's letter to the Medical Timu of Oct. 27, 1883.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fDr. GiUes de la Towrette, L'Hyp'IWtisme, &c. 559\nvictim. The two questions then to be settled are first, how far was will\nabolished; and, secondly, how far was consciousness abolished t As\nto the first question, the doctor thinks that in lethargy there is\ncertainly no power of resistance, the victim being a mere\" pd.te molle,\"\nand that in somnambulism there is more, as certain subjects are\nincapable of suggestion in that state. Consequently if a subject be\nre-hypnotised by the medico-legal expert, and found incapable hoth\nof lethargy and of suggestion in somnambulism, the case will not\ncome under this class. As to the question of consciousness, on which\nthe power of giving evidence depends, he thinks that if the crime\nwas committed in lethargy, there is no memory at all; if in \"lethargie\nlucide,\" that there is memory on waking; and if in somnam-\nbulism, that there is memory in the corresponding state of re-hypno-\ntisation. But while he recognises the fickleness of such evidence,\nI do not find him laying down the obvious canon that it never\nought to tell against anybody without independent corroboration.\nNow the doctor's restricted and pathological view of hypnotism\nmatters in this connection the less, that probably in most \/UJalthy\nsubjects there would be a very large power of resistance, at any\nrate during the \"alert\" stage, and probably well on into the deep\nstage, to any improper suggestion or attempt: while in a hysterical\nperson there would be a smaller fund of instinctive moral resistance\nboth in hypnotism and out of it. Therefore we may accept the Doctor's\nrules on this head provisionally,-always bearing in mind his radical\nassumption,--a.nd cheerfully subscribe to his proposal to protect\n\"l'inconscient\" from outrage by the code of France, just as it is protected\nby the codes of Belgium, Germany, and Spain. Before gratefully leaving\nthis section, I may remark how irresistibly the\" Castellan case,\" quoted\nby so many authors, strikes one as having a fine incrustation of myth.\nToo long to cite, it is so much in danger of becoming classic that I\nmay notice the unjudicial, the professionally literary style, in which\nit is always presented, and the strange trust accorded to the\ndetailed evidence of all the witnesses, who refrained without apparent\nmotive from interfering with what they make out as a weird and\ndreadful outrage.\nOn the next head Dr. de 180 Tourette is decidedly too roseate in his\nassurances, and Mr. Myers is perhaps too easily comforted. Dr. Liegeois\ntook pains to show that persons can be made, under the influence of sug-\ngestion, to commit, both during or after hypnotism, crimes, to forget both\nwho the suggester was and their own act, and even sincerely to throw\nsuspicion on some third person. Dr. de la Tourette dismisses all these\nexperiments as \"purely of the ls.boratory,\" and points to the ma.nifold\nchances of 'frustration in real life through some slip in the programme\nenjoined by the hypnotiser, or through the subject mana.gin~to resist,\nDigitized by ~oo8le\n\f. 560 Critical Notices.\nevade, or disclose the injunction. In Jean J[M'f&(JIJ, M. Claretie's\ninadequate and crudely wrought story (said to have been transcribed\nfrom a laboratory experiment), the subject commits theft and murder\nat the suggestion of her guilty lover, and will not reveal his name\nto justice until re-hypnotised and made to re-live the experience,\nsomewhat like the somnambulist in Tl~ J[00'n8~. It is not clear\nwhether the suggestion is executed in or after the hypnotic state, and\n(as far &8 my memory goes) the process of extracting the na.me is not\ndescribed. Again the comment occurs, that no man should be con-\nsidered guilty when thus denounced without almost &8 strong indt'-\npendent evidence &8 would be needed if he had not been thus denounced\nat all. It would be quite easy for the guilty hypnotiser to have foreseen\nthis procedure, and to have instilled a suggestion to denounce an\ninnocpnt person in case of justice adopting it. Theoretically, indeed,\nthere is no limit to the duel fought between justice and the criminal in\nthe soul of the unwitting accomplice, but practically justice having the\nlast word would imperil the criminal considerably. One point to settle\nwould be the extent to which subsequent counter-suggestion by justice\ncould annul a forgetfulness suggested by the criminal. How little the\nrules for hysterical hypnotism might hold in such a case, may be seen\nfrom the account of Professor Liegeois'demonstrations at the Congress\nof the \" Association Fran<;&ise\" at N&Dey, on August 18th, 1886. \"1\\1.\nLiegeois propose, pour donner une confirmation de ce qu'il a avance sur\n1& possibilite de faire, pendant Ie somnambulisme, des suggestions qui se\nrealiseront flLtalement au reveil, d'hypnotiser en presence des membres\nde 10. section plusieurs hommes, non It'!lllteNques, qu'il a a.menea.

L'injonction est irresi8tible7Mnt accomplie.\" 1\nTherefore, at least with some French temperaments, even if hysteria\nis absent, the risk of suggested crime is quite serious. One point\nimportant to clear up a.nd not named by the doctor is the limits of\nmoral resistance in the person for whom \"suggestion\" is pleaded.\nMost healthy subjects draw the line fairly on the right side of impro-\npriety or misdoing, but we do not know how far this resistance could\nbe ordered down by the hypnotiser insisting. Probably it would\nre!luire much less force to make such a subject sign a receipt than\ncommit a. misdemeanour. But in the hysterical subject it might be\nhard to distinguish between suggestion commonly called hypnotic and\nthe ordino.ry suggestion of the real principal and stronger spirit in a\ncrime to his loyo.l tool. And if any person, hysterical or not, aftt'r\nre-hypnotisation, should be pronounced to have irresponsibly committed\nI ReVile, No.3, p. 82 (italics mine throughC)11t). I\nDigitized by ~008 e\n\fDr. Gilles de la Towrette, L'Hypnotisme, tl:c. 561\na crime, they should of course suffer all the restrictions of the\nirresponsible.\nAs precautions against risking such a fate, Professor Liegeois recom-\nmends everyone to refuse to be hypnotised except by a trustworthy\nfriend. Mr. Myers quotes the further precaution of the friend suggesting\nto the-subject-\" You will not be able to be hypnotised by anyone else.\"\nOf course, the criminal on his side might suggest this too: but the\nexperiments I have read do not decisively show that this injunction\ncannot be ordered down in both cases. Professor Beaunis 1 goes so far as\nto say that no suggestion should be offered without the previous waking\nconsent of the pa.tient.\nAnother question justice might have to face is, \" Could this person\nhave been hypnotised for the first time against his will 1\" The doctor\nsuggests that by a ruse he might. Now the methods for turning common\ninto hypnotic sleep bear on the point, and are discussed by the German\nwriters, with whose researches (with the exception of Heidenhain's)\nDr. de 180 Tourette betrays no acquaintance. Rumpf,2 Malten 8 (quoting\nGscheidlen), and Borner,' agree that this is feasible, and Gscheidlen,\nby putting his hand on the heads of five workmen sleeping normally,\ndeveloped hypnotic symptoms. Borner says, curiously, that if\nconsciousnesa persists after the passage into abnormal sleep, the sleeper\nwakes, when let alone, from normal into hypnotic sleep; but if conscious-\nness has not persisted, wakes into normal life. It is right to add that\nat the Breslau debate, cited by Malten, it WIloS suggested that putting the\nhand on the head merely produced insensibility by deepening the\ncommon sleep. The point is not settled, but it is evident how it might\narise in the judicial inquiry whether a person could have unwittingly\nbeen made irresponsible.\nLastly, it should be remembered that throughout Dr. de 180Tourette\nrefuses to admit any evidence either for a special mesmeric influence, or\nfor mental suggestion, or for any form of experimental thought-trans-\nference. He never faces-yet can hardly not have heard of-the\nevidence to be found in the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical\nResearch, especially that of the Havre case, which also appears in La.\nSuggestion Mentale, by Dr. Ochorowicz. Yet, if true, tBa.t evidence\ntransforms the whole medico-legal theory of hypnotism. Till it is\nmore definitely established, it would not be much use to try to work\nout the practical consequences before the law. Nevertheless, Dr.\nGilles de 180 Tourette owes more respect to the evidence than he\ngives. O. ELTON.\n1 Le Somnambulisme Provoqm, p. 39.\ns Delttsche Moo.

It is disappointing, however,\nto find that M. Ochorowicz has so few experiments of his own to\nrecord. Of the 540 pages of which this book consists, nearly 300 art'\noccupied with excerpts from the already published experiments of other\ninvestigators, from Puysegur and Deleuze down to M. Liebeault and\nthe Society for Psychical Research. And of the remainder of the book\nthe greater part is devoted to a discussion of rival hypotheses, a.nd to\nthe dissection of inconclusive experiments. But his industry and\nperseverance appear to be in no way to blame for this somewhat meagre\nresult. He has been investigating the phenomena of hypnotism and\nits allied states for many years, and has always had in view the\npossibility of t.he supersensory communication alleged to have been\nobserved by other workers in the same field. Under the headings\n\"De la Suggestion Mentale Apparente\" and \"De la Suggestion\nMentale Probable,\" he gives the results of his earlier researches\nin this direction. These two chapters are perhaps the most interesting\nin the book. They prove not merely that M. Ochorowicz is a\npainstaking and indefatigable experimenter, but that he is ingenious\nand subtle to a high degree in ana.lysing the causes of miraculous-\nseeming manifestations. Too subtle, perhaps, on occasion. It is\ndifficult, for instance, to believe, if the experiment is accurately\nrecorded, that his explanation is entirely adequate in the following\ncase. M. Ochorowicz took up a novel by Kraszewski, Le Jlonde et Ie\nPoete, opened it at random out of ~ight of the subject, and requested\nhim to read it. He could, at first, see nothing. M. Ochorowicz then\nprompted him with the first two or tlwes tJXYtV\/.8 of the page, and the\nyoung man at once named correctly the cbapter and volume, and\nrecited the entire page, almost without a mistake. When M.\nOchorowicz put down the book, the subject stopped his recitation; but\nhe would go on, on a fresh page, if prompted, 80 long as M. Ochorowicz\nkept his eyes on the text.\nVoici l'explication du mystllre :\nLe jeune homme en question a lu derniilrement, \"deux lois de suite,\"le\nroman mentionnlS de Kraazewski; ill'avait lu, comme on Ie liaait dana Ie\ntemps en Pologne, surtout al'ige de six-Bept ana. n Ie aavait preaque par\nC<l!ur.

Ce aunt mAme cea erreura-llI. qui m'ont auggere l'expIica-\ntion vraie de l'experience; car, au lieu de lire mal un mot ecrit, il Ie\nremplaqait par un autre, analogue comme sena, maia tout-lI.-fait different\ncomme forme. Ayant ete entraine en dehora des aaaociationa exactea, par\nune erreur semblable, il a'a~tait ai je fermais Ie livre, parce que je ne\npouvaia plus lui venir en aide.\nMoreover, it appeared aubsequently that the young man could\n\"read,\" though less correctly, even when the book was closed. No\ndoubt M. Ochorowicz is right in. refusing to regard this as even a proof\npresumptive of thought-transference: though, to those who admit\nthought-transference as a fact in nature, it might not appear out of the\nquestion that the memory of the subject to some extent should be\nrevivified and supplemented by that agency. But the simpler and more\nprobable explanation of the \"subject's\" failure to read when the book\nwas closed appears to me to be that his capacity for \"reading\"\ndepended upon his belief that he was reading through the eyes of the\noperator. To accept his own explanation would argue a want of care\non the part of M. Ochorowicz of which, on the evidence supplied by\nthis book, he may reasonably be acquitted.\nElsewhere, however, his comments are eminently just. Here, for\ninstance, is an account of an experiment conducted by himself in\nwaking a hypnotised subject by mental suggestion. The experiment\nsucceeded perfectly on the first trial; the subject awoke as soon as the\nmental command was formulated. An equal measure of auccess\nattended his subsequent experiments of the same kind; but he found\nhimself unable to compel the subject to execute his commands when he\nwilled that she should perform certain movements. Why, then, he\nasks, did she obey my commands in the one case and remain insensitive\nin the other 1\nEn voici 180 raison; il y avait 1& deux habitudes, qui avaient paaae\ninaperquea. Continuant Ie traitement depuia plusieura semainea, j'avaia pria\nl'habitude de 1& reveiller juate une demi-heure aprea 180 declaration du\nBOmmeil; je ne regardaia pas la montre, mais je venaia toujoura lI. l'heure\nfixe, et: comma c'etait une heure avant Ie eitner, mon eatomac remplaqait\nparfaitement ma montre.\nQuant lI. 180 malade, elle a pria egalement l'habitudll de se reveiller presque\nexactement lI. 180 minute-phenomilne bien connu dea hypnotiaeura.

After\nconsidering this and other limilar experiences, he makes the suggestive\nremark: \"II Y a toujours deux questions A eIucider. La question,\nComment Ie sujet a-t-il pu deviner III. pensae 1 n'est que III. seconde:\ntandis que III. premiere consiste asavoir: Comment l'experimentateur\nest arrive a choisir une pensea plutOt qu'une autre t\" (p. 1i.) He\nappli~s this canon to the noteworthy series of experiments with\nMadame D. The subject was in a nomlal state, with her back turned\ntowards the two experimenters, who were in contact (the exact nature\nof the contact is not staW) with her throughout the experiment.,\nalthough out of her sight. Under these conditions the names of cards,\nimaginary colours and tastes, objects in the room, &c., were correctly\nnamed in a considerable proportion of the trials. (A full record of\ntheRe experiments WR.8 sent to us by M. Ochorowicz in the spring of\nlast YMr, ami will be found quoted in Phantasm8 of the Lit;ng, V01. II.,\npp. 661-4.) M. Ochorowicz hesitates to regard these experiments\nas conclusive. He thinks them to a certain extent invalidaW by the\ncircllmstanct's of \"\"hat he calls \"Ie milieu psychique.\" All the objects\nthought of (t'XCllpt the cards, which wel\"e drawn at random from a full\npack) were chosen at the time by one or other of the experimenters.\nThe laws of the R.88OCiation of idea.'I, he explains, are very obscure:\nthe links of connection are frequently automatic and unconscious, and\nspring from the sensation of the moment. A conjurer takes advantage\nof this fact to force upon his audience the choice which he wishes them\nto make, by creating, so to speak, the appropriate psychical environ-\nment. But in the experiments described, the psychical environment\nWR.8 rt'MY made; the mental furniture of the three persons present\nmust have heen to a great extent common; and it is probable, there-\nforll, unless special precautions were taken to prevent it (e.g., by\nselt'cting the tests before the commencement of the experiments), that\nthe trains of association leading them to think of one ohject rather\nthan another would also be common in many cases to both operators\nand subject. The experimenters themselvfl8, who can alone know the\nprinciples, if any, which guided their selection of the objects thought\nof, can best judge how far the force of this series of experiments is\nrt>.ally impaired hy these considerations. A more serious evidential\ndeft'ct-R.8 Mr. Gurney hR.8 already pointed out-is that in many\ncast's the object chosen WR.8 actually in the room, and that it is not\u00b7\nstat.l\u00b7d what precautions were taken to prevent the attention of the\n\"suhject\" from heing directed to it by normal means.\nIt is only within the last 15 months that M. Ochorowicz has\nsucceeded in obtaining conclusive proof of the possibility of super-\nsensuous communication. M. Richet's results_n account of which was\npuhlished in the Re1J'lU Phil080phiqu,e in December, 1884--appear to\nizedbyGoogle\n\fDr. J. Oc1wrowi,cz, De la, Suggestion Mentale. 565\nhave given him the first impetus towards definite experiment. As,\nhowever, immediately after describing M. Richet's experiment&, he\ngoes on to preface a recital of his own preliminary attempts with\nthe words, \"J'entrepris une serie d'experiences dans Ie but de verifier\ncelles qui ont ete faites par la Society 1()If' Psychical Researches,\"\nwe may infer that he became acquainted with the work of the preceding\nfew years in England at about the same period. The experiments\nof Messrs. Gibert and Pierre Janet, in inducing sleep by mental\nsuggestion at a distance, were the first undoubted proofs which he.\nreceived. These experiments have been fully described by Mr. F. W.\nH. Myers (who was present with Dr. A. T. Myers throughout M.\nOchorowicz's visit to Havre) in the Proceeding\" Part X., pp. 127 ee ,eq.,\nand need not be further dwelt on here.\nM.Ochorowicz returned from Havre eager to follow up the clue\nwhich had been given him; and he did, in fact, succeed in impressing\ncommands upon certain hypnotised subjects by mental suggestion.\nThe actions prescribed were, however, as a rule of a comparatively\nsimple kind; and the operator was, in many cases, in actual contact\nwith the subject, or at least was in her immediate vicinity. It is\ndifficult, therefore, without a much fuller description of the precautions\ntaken, to feel confident that no hint of the act to be performed could\nhave been derived from &e8tures or other indications of a normal kind.\nThe following spontaneous experience seems to be free from any\nobjection on this score, though standing alone it cannot have much\nweight, as lucky guessing would be a quite possible explanation.\nAfter describing two or three observations on a subject whom he was\nhypnotising therapeutically, and who seemed to be occasionally aware\nin the hypnotic sleep of the operator's mental state, M. Ochorowicz\nproceeds to relate the following experience :-\nJ'arrive ehez Mlle. S.\n..

Ceat-a-dire qu'elle me voyait 8crire encore;' 11 heUftlll,\ntandis que je me luis leve , lOh_45 ;. peu pfta, etc.\nThe acantineaa of our author's positive results is probably to be\nexplained, in part, by the fact of his having hitherto almost\nexclusively confined his experiments to persons actually in the\nhypnotic trance. As he himself points out, the precise stage at which\nthe hypnotised subject is most amenable to mental suggestion is in the\nbrief period of transition between two well\u00b7marked phases of the trance\n-the deep lethargic sleep (~tat ald~ique), in which the subject is\nincapable of originating speech or motion of any kind, and the lucid\nsomnambulic state (~~t polyideique), in which the activity of his own\nmind overpowers the comparatively feeble suggestions received from\nwithout. In our own experiments in thought-transference with\nhypnotised subjects, we found great difficulty in preventing the\npercipient from relapsing in the middle of the experiment into a deep\nspeechleaa slumber, from which no hint of mental suggestion could be\nextracted. If the waking state is not always so favourable to the\nreception of telepathic suggestions, the conditions are, at any rate,\nmore stable and of longer duration. Now, not only does M.\nOchorowicz seem rarely to have experimented with persons in the\nnormal state, but it b.as not even occurred to him to try with persons\nwho have not beeen proved to be readily susceptible of hypnotisation.\nIf the truth must be told, his parental partiality for that rather\ndubious little toy, the hypnoscope, seemB to have been somewhat of a\nsnare to him; for indirectly it has led on to a partiality, which the\nresults in no way justify, for the particular class of sensitives that his\ntalisman l..veals to him. And whilst he has thus neglected a wide\nfield of experiment, he has been led into what seems to be an over\nhasty generalisation. For he lays it down more than once as an\nundoubted canon that, for mental luggestion to be effective, a special\n'I'appO'f't is neceaaary between the operator and subject. We know so\nlittle of the conditions under which such transference of ideas takes\nplace that we cannot deny that there may be a sense in which this is\ntrue; but apparently M. Ochorowicz connotes by the word rapporC\nsome previously established and cognisable bond between the two\nparties; and in that case his &8Bertion is certainly misleading, as he\nwould have been willing to admit if he had been present at some of the\nexperiments conducted at Dean'a-yard, or with Mr. Guthrie's percipients\nat Liverpool and elsewhere. It has happened on more than one occasion\nthat a complete stranger to the percipient has met with startling and\nimmediate success, where failure has rewarded the efforts of the rest\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fDr. J. Ochorowicz, De la, Suggestion Mentale, 567\nof the investigators. Nor do the records of spontaneous telepathy\n8upport so sweeping a generalisation. Out of 830 cases recorded in\nPhantaBmB ofthe Living we find that in 36 the action took place between\nstrangers; the only traceable rapport being the fact of the two\npersons having a common friend, or such common associations as may\nbe presumed to exist between inhabitants of the same town.\nOfthe second section of the work it is not necessary to say nluch. It\nconsists of copious citations from the works of the earlier French investi-\ngators, and of such later writers as Professor Beaunis and Dr. Liebeault,\ndesigned to illustrate various phases of the subject.\nThe last 100 pages of the book are devoted to a discussion of the\nvarious hypotheses which have been put forward from time to time to\naccount for the phenomena. When M. Cousin asked Hegel for a\n8uccinct statement of his views, the German philosopher is said to have\nreplied, \"Ces choses-ci ne se disent ni succinctement, ni en fran~\"\nWe may doubt, in turn, whether it would be possible to compress\nwithin a few pages of intelligible English the gist of these rival\ntheories, and whether the result, if attained, would be commensurate\nwith the labour. One comment, on the hypothesis of a universal\nfluid which serves as the intermediary of the brain-waves, is, perhaps,\n'Worth quoting :-\nM. Deapine attribue II. l'ather 1& chaleur, 1& lumillre, l'electriciU, Ie\nmagnatisme terrestre, 1& gravitation, l'attraction moIeculaire, lea aftinite.\nchemiques, les fonctions de 1& vie organique, callea de l'automatisme, et enfin\ncelIe du carveau. Je crois qu'il ne reste plus grand chose II. distribuer. Si,\nreate 1& Providence! (p. 483.)\nOur author's own theory depends upon the supposition that electrical\nand nervous energy are to a certain extent reciprocally convertible.\nHe illustrates his view by the analogy of the photophone-an\ninstrument in which a mirror is made to vibrate to the human voice.\nThe mirror reflects a ray of light, which, vibrating in its tum, falls.\nupon a plate of selenium, modifying its electric conductivity. The\nintermittent current so produced is transmitted through a telephone\n-and the original articulate sound is reproduced. Now in hypnotised\nsubjects--a.nd M. Ochorowicz never treats of thought-transference\nbetween persons in the normal state-the equilibrium of the nervous\nsystem, he sees reason to believe, is profoundly affected. He supposes\nthen that the electric currents of the atmosphere are modified by the\nnervous energy of the agent; that the disturbance so produced is\ntransmitted to the nervous system of the percipient, already in a state\nof tension, and there reproduces a corresponding modification of the\nnerve-elements.\nIn the present state of our knowledge, it would be premature to\ndiscuss the theory here very briefly and inadequately ~marised.\nDigitized by ~qpgle\n\f568 Critical Notices.\nBut it may be worth while to point out that our own conception of\ntelepathy involves, strictly speaking, no theory at all. It involves as\nlittle of pure theory as Newton's conception of the law of gravitation.\nWhat Newton did was to find the simplest general expression for the\nO_\"ed facts by saying that the heavenly bodies acted upon each\nother with a certain measurable force. He did not attempt to explain\nthe mode of the action; he contented himself with asserting its\nexistence, and defining its limits. And whilst succeeding astronomers\nhave for the most part been content to follow his example, the Science\nhas nevertheless advanced in a steady and continuous progression.\nSo the conception of telepathy simply colligates the observed facts\nof spontaneous and experimental thought-transference, as instances\nof the action of one mind upon another. The nature of that action the\ntheory does not discuss: it merely defines it negatively, as being\noutside the normal sensory channels. Nor is there any reason to\nsuppose that the further advancement of the subject at the present\ntime is dependent on the discovery of physical correlates for the alleged\npaychical action.\nIn conclusion, it must be said that the zeal and industry shown by\nM.Ochorowicz are deserving of a fuller measure of success: and I have\nlittle doubt that he will meet with it. In some departments of\npsychical research, at any rate, he would appear to have no lack of\nmaterial, if his estimate is correct, that 30 per cent. of his fellow-\ncountrymen are easily susceptible of hypnotisation.\nFRANK PODKOU.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f","_id":545}
