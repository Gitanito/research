Twopence, 4-12 pp.\n\n  Founded, as its advertisements noted, \"on Good Friday, 1928.\"  Winifred Moyes was a powerful trance medium who from 1924 until her death in 1957 directly mediated the spirit of Zodiac and his Christian and philanthropic messages.  This journal, begun in 1928, replaced the informal circulation of mimeographed copies of Zodiac's messages.  Moyes was fortunate in attracting the attention and belief of Aeschimann (1892-1979), a Swiss living in London, and other benefactors whose generosity has enabled the association formed to spread Zodiac's message to continue until today.  Beginning in the 1930s, the Association published German-, French-, and Dutch-language versions of the journal, the first of which appears to continue now as Die Gr\u00f6sserewelt, and also The Children's Greater World.  From 1989, the organization also published a Greater World Newsletter. See the note under Le Monde Superieur.
