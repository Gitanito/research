As his interests changed from the H.B. of L. to the Ordre Martiniste, the Union Id\u00e9aliste Universelle, the Tradition Cosmique of Max Theon, and the Christian mysticism of Holden Edward Sampson (\"Light,\" 1859- ) , so did the journal's content.  It was the organ of Davidson's and Sampson's Order of the Cross and Serpent and, from 1905, of the the Tradition Cosmique of Max Theon.  S.C. Gould, Arcane Fraternities in the United States (Manchester, NH, 1905), 7, says that this is \"a journal for the proclamation of the Mysteries and Lost Truths of the Ancient Wisdom Religion of Jesus Christ.\"  Davidson and his confederate in the H.B. of L., T.H. Burgoyne, fled Britain after the exposure of the brotherhood's fraudulent colony scheme.  Davidson ended up in Georgia and seemingly took no part in Burgoyne's attempts to revive the organization in the United States but remained active in advising its members in France.  He was, nonetheless, influential in America, reviving connections from his days as Grand Master of the North of the H.B. of L. or making new ones among the inheritance of P.B. Randolph and the H.B. of L.  The journal advertised Hiram Butler's Esoteric, Charles Mackay's Oracle, George R. Charles's Christian Metaphysician, Parsival Braun's New Man and Der Meister and The Mastery of Fate, George Chainey's Interpreter, Cyrus R. Teed's Flaming Sword, the Temple Artisan, R.S. Clymer, S.C. Gould's Notes and Queries, Franz Hartmann's Sphinx, etc.  Duke University microfilm; House of the Temple, Washington, D.C.; LOC.\n\n       Morning Star V1 N1 May 1892 Morning Star V1 N2 Jun 1892 Morning Star V1 N3 Jul 1892 Morning Star V1 N4 Aug 1892 Morning Star V1 N5 Sep 1892 Morning Star V1 N6 Oct 1892 Morning Star V1 N7 Nov 1892 Morning Star V1 N8 Dec 1892 Morning Star V1 N9 Jan 1893 Morning Star V1 N10 Feb 1893 Morning Star V1 N11 Mar 1893 Morning Star V1 N12 Apr 1893 Morning Star V10 N4 Aug 1901 Morning Star V15 Index 1906-7 Morning Star V16 N1 May 1907 Morning Star V16 N2 Jun 1907 Morning Star V16 N3 Jul 1907      <\/p>\n\n  \r\nIAPSOP materials are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License. \r\n IAPSOP respects people's privacy and personal data rights.             <\/HTML>\n\n[1] http:\/\/iapsop.com\/archive\/materials\/morning_star","_id":1255}
