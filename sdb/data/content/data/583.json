A. J. Balfour, M.P.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\u2014In accordance with precedent, I have to\nbegin my observations to you by calling to your recollection the\nmelancholy fact that since last there was a meeting of this Society\nwe have lost two of our most important and most valued members.\nLess than a fortnight ago\\ Dr. Arthur Myers, a member of the Council,\nand not only a member of the Council, but one who ever since the\ninception of this Society has done admirable, and, indeed, invaluable\nwork in conection with its labours, passed away. The loss which his\nfriends have sustained by his death it would not be proper for me on\nsuch an occasion to dwell upon,\u2014however much, as one of the oldest of\nthose friends, whose friendship dated from Cambridge days, now twenty\nyears ago, I might be tempted to do so. But it is strictly within the\nscope of my duties to remind you of the admirable aid which he has\ngiven to our investigations, of the untiring zeal which he has thrown\ninto all the matters that came before him, of his self-sacrificing energy,\nand the liberality with which he spent in our service both time and\nmoney.\nWe have lost another distinguished member of our body\u2014not in this\ncase one who was associated very closely with our work, but one, never\ntheless, who by the lustre of his name added dignity to our proceedings\nand who might, had his life been spared, have largely helped us, I\nbelieve, in experimental investigations\u2014I allude to Professor Hertz, a\ncorresponding member of our body. As those of you will know who\nhave had the opportunity of following recent developments of physical\nscience, he was the fortunate individual who demonstrated experi\nmentally the identity of light and of certain electro-magnetic phe\nnomena. This identity had been divined, and elaborated on the side\nof theory, by one of the greatest of English, I ought perhaps to say\nof Scotch, men of science, Clerk Maxwell, but it had never been\nconclusively proved until Professor Hertz, about five years ago,\nstartled Europe by the experimental identification of these physical\nforces. The extraordinary interest and the far-reaching importance\nof a discovery like this will not perhaps be appreciated by every one\nof my audience, but all of those who take an interest in such subjects\nwill see that by this stroke of experimental genius a very large stride\n\fPresident!8 Address. 3\nhas been made towards establishing the unity of the great physical\npowers of nature.\nThe mention of a great physical discovery like this, made by one\nof our own body, naturally suggests reflections as to our actual\nscientific position. What, we feel tempted to ask, is at the present\ntime the relation of such results as we have arrived at to the general\nview which hitherto science has taken of that material universe in\nwhich we live 1 I must confess that, when I call to mind the history\nof these relations in the past, the record is not one on which\nwe can dwell with any great satisfaction. Consider, for example,\nthe attitude maintained by the great body of scientific opinion,\nwhether medical or physical, towards the phenomena which used\nto be known as mesmeric, but which have now been re-baptised,\nwith Braid's term, as hypnotic. As most of you are aware, it is\nvery little more than a century since the public attention of Europe,\nand especially of certain parts of the continent, was called to\nthese extraordinary phenomena by the discoveries\u2014 if I may call\nthem discoveries, for, after all, they were known long before his time\n\u2014of Mesmer. Mesmer produced hypnotic phenomena, which are now\nfamiliar to everybody, and, not content with that, he invented a\ntheory to account for them. The theory is an extremely bad one, and\nI imagine, has fallen into the disrepute which it deserves ; for Mesmer\ncommitted the error, which has been repeated now and then since, of\ntrying to find an explanation for strange and unaccountable facts bj\nsimply describing them as the effect of some equally strange and\nunaccountable cause. He declared that there was a kind of magnetic\nfluid to the operations of which the results that he obtained were\ndue ; and he undoubtedly did his reputation much disservice in the\nminds of the scientific experts of the time by associating his discoveries\nwith speculations which, after all, did not at the time stand, anc1\nhave not since stood, the test of critical investigation. Nevertheless,\nthe facts that Mesmer brought forward could be proved in the last\ncentury, as they can be proved now, by experimental evidence of the most\nconclusive character. It can be shewn that they are neither the result\nof deliberate fraud nor unconscious deception, and, accordingly, there\nwas here a problem presented for solution which it was plainly the\nduty of men of science in general, and, probably, of the medical pro\nfession in particular, to examine and probe to the bottom ; to explain\nif they could, but not to explain away if they could not. Their actual\ncourse was a very different one. There were, indeed, a good many\ndoctors and other men of science who could not refuse the evidence\nof their senses, and who loudly testified to the truth, the interest,\nand the importance of the phenomena which they witnessed. But if\nyou take the body of opinion of men of science generally, you will be\nb 2\n\f4 President's Address.\ndriven to the conclusion that they either denied facte which they ought\nto have seen were true, or that they thrust them aside without con\ndescending to consider them worthy of serious investigation. There\nwere, I believe, no less than two or three Commissions of enquiry\u2014\nthree, I think\u2014instituted in France alone. one in Mesmer's lifetime,\nand the other two, unless my memory deceives me, after his death.\nThe amount of evidence collected, at all events by one of those Com\nmissions, composed of some of the most eminent scientific men in\nFrance, should have been enough to call the attention of all Europe to\nthe new problems thus raised. The report which embodied this\nevidence was, nevertheless, allowed to lie unnoticed upon the shelf ;\nand it has only been by a gradual process of re-discovery, a constant\nand up-hill fight on the part of the less prejudiced members of the\ncommunity, that the truths of hypnotism, as far as they are yet\nattained, have reached something like general recognition ; even now,\nperhaps, their full importance\u2014whether from a therapeutic or a\npsychological point of view \u2014 has not been sufficiently acknow\nledged.\nWhat I have just very briefly and rudely sketched out to you is\nthe history of an investigation into one small section of these alleged\nphenomena which fall outside the ordinary field of scientific investiga\ntion. If we took it by itself we should say that scientific men have\nshown in connection with it a bigoted intolerance, an indifference to\nstrictly scientific evidence, which is, on the face of it, discreditable. I,\nhowever, do not feel inclined to pass any verdict of so harsh a\ncharacter upon the action of the great body of scientific men. I believe\nthat, although the course they pursued was not one which it is very\neasy rationally to justify, nevertheless there was a great deal more of\npractical wisdom in it than might appear at first sight. I have always\nbeen impressed by the lesson taught us by the general course of\nhistory, that you cannot expect, either of any single nation or of any\nsingle age, that it will do more than the special work which happens,\nso to speak, to be set before it at the moment. You cannot -expect\nmen, being what they are, to labour effectively in more than one\nrelatively restricted field at the same time ; and if they insist on\ndiffusing their energies over too wide a surface, the necessary result, as\nI believe, will be that their labours will prove unfruitful. Now just\nconsider what it is that men of science have done in the century which\nhas elapsed since the first French Commission investigated Mesmer's\ndiscoveries. I do not believe it would be going too far to say that the\nwhole body of the sciences, with the exception of mechanics, especially\nmechanics as applied to celestial motions\u2014that the whole body of\nthe sciences outside that limited sphere has been reconstructed from\ntop to bottom. Our leading ideas in chemistry, our leading ideas in\n\fPresident's Address. 5\nphysics, the theory of light, the theory of sound, the whole of geology,\nthe great generalisation known as the conservation of energy, and all\nthe speculations and extensions which have succeeded that great\ngeneralisation, the whole theory of natural selection and of biological\nevolution, are all the birth of the hundred years which have\nelapsed since first Mesmer made hypnotic phenomena notorious through\nEurope. I think if scientific men, looking back upon the past, choose\nto set up for themselves this defence, that after all only one thing can\nbe done at a time, that they were occupied in co-ordinating within\ncertain lines the experimental data then available, and that, in harmony\nwith a given conception of the material world, they were laying deep\nthe foundations of that vast and imposing fabric of modern science,\nI for one should accept the plea as a bar to further proceedings. For\nthe men who did that work could not have done it, I believe, unless\nthey had rigidly confined themselves to one particular conception of\nthe world with which they had to deal. If they had insisted on inclu\nding in their survey not merely the well-travelled regions of everyday\nexperience, but the dark and doubtful territories within which our\nlabours lie, their work would have been worse, not better ; less, not\nmore complete. They may have been narrow ; but their narrowness\nhas been our gain. They may have been prejudiced ; but their pre\njudices have been fruitful, and we have reaped the harvest. I have\noften thought that when, on looking back over the history of human\nspeculation, we find some individual who has anticipated the discoveries\nof a later age, but has neither himself been able to develop those dis\ncoveries nor yet to interest his contemporaries in them, we are very\napt to bestow on him an undue meed of honour. \"Here,\" we say, \"was\na man before his time. Here was a man of whom his age was not\nworthy.\" Yet such men do very little indeed for the progress of the\nworld of which at first sight they would appear to be among the most\ndistinguished citizens. There is no use in being before your age after\nsuch a fashion as this. If neither you nor those to whom you speak\ncan make use of the message that you thus prematurely deliver, so far\nas the development of the world is concerned you might as well have\nnot lived at all. When, therefore, we are asked to put our hands in\nour pockets and subscribe towards the erection of memorials to\nhalf forgotton worthies like these, by all means let us do it. It is\nnatural and even praiseworthy. But do not let us suppose that those\nwhom we thus honour really stand out among the benefactors of our\nspecies. They are interesting ; but hardly useful.\nThis, however, is merely a parenthetical reflection, to which I do\nnot ask your agreement, and which, after all, has nothing to do with\nthe general drift of the argument that I desire to lay before you. The\nquestion I now wish you to consider is: Granting to men of science that\n\f6 President's Address.\nthey had, if not a theoretical and speculative excuse, still a practical\njustification, for the course they have adopted in regard to these obscure\npsychical phenomena during the last hundred years, is that justifiation\nstill valid ? For myself, I think it is not. I think the time has now\ncome when it is desirable in their own interests, and in our interests,\nthat the leaders of scientific thought in this country and elsewhere\nshould recognise that there are well-attested facts which, though they\ndo not easily fit into the framework of the sciences, or of organised\nexperience as they conceive it, yet require investigation and explana\ntion, and which it is the bounden duty of science, if not itself to in\nvestigate, at all events to assist us in investigating.\nI am, of course, aware that there are necessarily connected with\nour work difficulties and obstructions in the way of experiment\nwith which scientific men are not familiar, and which not unnaturally\nrouse in their minds both dislike and suspicion. To begin with, there\nis the difficulty of fraud. The ordinary scientific man no doubt finds the\npath of experimental investigation strewn with difficulties, but at least\nhe does not usually find among them the difficulty presented by human\nfraud. He knows that, if he is misled in any particular, it is the fault\nof the observer, and not the fault of the observed. He knows that, if\nhis cross-examination of nature fails to elicit anything, it is because\nhe has not known how to cross-examine, not because nature when put\nin the witness box tells untruths. But unfortunately in the matters\nwith which we have to deal this is not the case. We have come\nacross, and it is inevitable that we should come across, cases where\neither deliberate fraud or unconscious deception makes observation\ndoubly and trebly difficult, and throws obstacles in the way of the\ninvestigator which his happier brother in the region of material and\nphysical science has not to contend with.\nAnd there is yet another difficulty in our work from which those\nwho cultivate physical science are happily free. They have, as the\nultimate sources of their knowledge, the \"five senses\" with which we\nare all endowed, and which are the only generally recognised inlets\nthrough which the truth of external nature can penetrate into\nconsciousness. But we of this Society have perforce to deal with cases\nin which not merely the normal five or six senses, but some abnormal\nand half-completed sense, so to speak, comes into play ; in which we\nhave to work, not with the organisations of an ordinary and normal type,\nbut with certain exceptional organisations who can neither explain,\naccount for, nor control the abnormal powers they appear to possess.\nThis is not only a special difficulty with which we have to\ncontend ; it is the basis of a serious objection, in the eyes of\nmany scientific men, to the admission of the subject matter of our\nresearches into the sphere of legitimate investigation. These critics\n\fPresident's Address. 7\nseem to think that because we cannot repeat and verify our experi\nments as we will and when we will\u2014because we cannot, as it were, put\nour phenomena in a retort and boil them over a spirit lamp and\nalways get the same results\u2014that therefore the phenomena themselves\nare not worth examining. But this is, I venture to say, a very\nunphilosophic view of the question. Is there, after all, any inherent\na priori improbability in there being these half-formed and imperfectly\ndeveloped senses, or inlets of external information, occasionally and\nsporadically developed in certain members of the human race ? Surely\nnot. I should myself be disposed to say that if the theory of develop\nment be really sound, phenomena like these, however strange, are\nexactly what we should have expected. For what says the theory of\nnatural selection 1 Why this, among other things : that there has\ngradually been elaborated by the slaughter of the unfit and the sur\nvival of the fit, an organism possessed of senses adapted to further its\nsuccess in the struggle for existence. To suppose that the senses\nelaborated in obedience to this law should be in correspondence with\nthe whole of external nature, appears to me to be not only improbable\nbut, on any rational doctrine of probability, absolutely impossible.\nThere must be countless forms of being, countless real existences\nwhich, had the line of an evolution gone in a different direction, or\nhad the necessities of our primitive ancestors been of a different kind,\nwould have made themselves known to us through senses the very\ncharacter of which we are at present unable to imagine. And, if this be\nso, is it not in itself likely that here and there we should come across\nrudimentary beginnings of such senses ; beginnings never developed\naud probably never to be developed by the operation of selection ;\nmere by-products of the great evolutionary machine, never destined to\nbe turned to any useful account ? And it may be\u2014I am only hazard\ning an unverifiable guess\u2014it may be, I say, that in these cases of the\nindividuals thus abnormally endowed, we really have come across\nfaculties which, had it been worth Nature's while, had they been of\nany value or purpose in the struggle for existence, might have been\nnormally developed, and thus become the common possession of the\nwhole human race. Had this occurred, we should have been enabled\nto experiment' upon phenomena, which we now regard as occult and\nmysterious, with the same confidence in the sources of our information\nthat we now enjoy in any of our ordinary enquiries into the laws of the\nmaterial world. Well, if there be, as I think, no great antecedent im\nprobability against there being these occasional and sporadic modifica\ntions of the organism, I do not think that men of science ought to\nshow any distrustful impatience of the apparent irregularity of these\nabnormal phenomena which is no doubt one of their most provoking\ncharacteristics.\n\f8 President's Address.\nBut there is another and a real difficulty, from the point of view\nof science, attaching to the result of our investigations, which is not\ndisposed of by the theory which I have suggested of imperfectly\ndeveloped senses. Such senses, if they exist at all, may evidently be\nof two kinds, or may give us two kinds of experience. They may\ngive us a kind of experience which shall be in perfect harmony with\nour existing conception of the physical universe, or they may give us\none which harmonises with that conception imperfectly or not at all.\nAs an example of the first I might revert to the discovery, previously\nreferred to, of Professor Hertz. He, as I have already told you, has\nexperimentally proved that electro-magnetic phenomena are identical,\nas physical phenomena, with ordinary light. Light consists, as you\nall know, of undulations of what is known as the luminiferous ether ;\nwell, electro-magnetic waves are also undulations of the same ether,\ndiffering from the undulations which we call light only in their\nlength. Now it is easy to conceive that we might have had a sense\nwhich would have enabled us to perceive the long undulations in the\nsame way as we now perceive the short ones. That would be a new\nsense, but, though new, its deliverances would have fitted in with the\nexisting notions which scientific men have framed of the universe.\nBut unfortunately in our special investigations we seem to come across\nexperiences which are not so amenable We apparently get hints of\nthe existence of facts, which, if they be well established, as they\nappear to be, cannot, so far as I can judge, by any amount of\nsqueezing or manipulation be made to fit into the interstices of our\naccepted view of the physical world ; and, if that be so, then we are\nengaged in a work of prodigious difficulty indeed, but of an\nimportance of which the difficulty is only a measure and an indicator.\nFor we should then be actually on the threshold, so to speak, of\na region ordered according to laws of which we have at present\nno cognisance, and which do not appear to harmonise\u2014I do not\nsay they are in contradiction to, but at least they do not appear\nto harmonise\u2014with those which govern the regions already within\nour ken.\nLet me dwell on this point a little more, as it is one of central\ninterest to all who are engaged in our special investigations.\nWhat I am asserting is that the facts which we come across are very\nodd facts, and by that I do not mean merely queer and unexpected : I\nmean \" odd \" in the sense that they are out of harmony with the\naccepted theories of the material world. They are not merely dramatic\nally strange, they are not merely extraordinary and striking, but they are\n\" odd \" in the sense that they will not easily fit in with the views which\nphysicists and men of science generally give us of the universe in\nwhich we live.\n\fPresident's Address. 9\nIn order to illustrate this distinction I will take a very simple\ninstance. I suppose everybody would say that it would be an extra\nordinary circumstance if at no distant date this earth on which we\ndwell were to come into collision with some unknown body travelling\nthrough space, and, as the result of that collision, be resolved into the\noriginal gases of which it is composed. Yet, though it would be an\nextraordinary, and even an amazing, event, it is, after all, one of which\nno astronomer, I venture to say, would assert the impossibility. He\nwould say, I suppose, that it was most unlikely, but that if it occurred\nit would not violate, or even modify, his general theories as to the laws\nwhich govern the movements of the celestial bodies. Our globe is a\nmember of the solar system which is travelling I do not know how\nmany miles a second in the direction of the constellation Hercules.\nThere is no a priori ground for saying that in the course of that\nmysterious journey, of the cause of which we are perfectly ignorant,\nwe shall not come across some body in interstellar space which will\nproduce the uncomfortable results which I have ventured to indicate.\nAnd, as a matter of fact, in the course of the last two hundred years,\nastronomers have themselves been witness to stellar tragedies of incom\nparably greater magnitude than that which would be produced by the\ndestruction of so insignificant a planet as the world in which we happen\nto be personally interested. We have seen stars which shine from an\nunknown distance, and are of unknown magnitude, burst into sudden\nconflagration, blaze brightly for a time, and then slowly die out again.\nWhat that phenomenon precisely indicates, of course, we cannot say,\nbut it certainly indicates an accident of a far more startling and\ntremendous kind than the shattering of our particular world, which to\nus would, doubtless, seem extraordinary enough.\nThis, then, is a specimen of what I mean by a dramatically extra\nordinary event. Now I will give you a case of what I mean by a\nscientifically extraordinary event, which as you will at once perceive\nmay be one which at first sight, and to many observers, may appear\nalmost common-place and familiar. I have constantly met people who\nwill tell you, with no apparent consciousness that they are saying\nanything more out of the way than an observation about the weather,\nthat by the exercise of their will they can make anybody at a little\ndistance turn round and look at them. Now such a fact (if fact it be)\nis far more scientifically extraordinary than would be the destruction\nof this globe by some such celestial catastrophe as I have imagined.\nHow profoundly mistaken, then, are they who think that this\nexercise of will power, as they call it, is the most natural and most\nnormal thing m the world, something that everybody would have\nexpected, something which hardly deserves scientific notice or requires\nscientific explanation. In reality it is a profound mystery if it be true,\n\f10 President's Address.\nor if anything like it be true ; and no event, however startling, which\neasily finds its appropriate niche in the structure of the physical\nsciences ought to excite half so much intellectual curiosity as this dull\nand at first sight common-place phenomenon.\nNow do not suppose that I want you to believe that every gentle\nman or lady who chooses to suppose him or herself exceptionally\nendowed with this so-called will-power is other than the dupe of an\nill-regulated fancy. There is, however, quite apart from the testimony\nof such persons a vast mass of evidence in favour of what we now call\ntelepathy ; and to telepathy the observations I have been making do in\nmy opinion most strictly apply. For, consider ! In every case of\ntelepathy you have an example of action at a distance. Examples of\nreal or apparent action at a distance are of course very common.\nGravitation is such an example. We are not aware at the present\ntime of any mechanism, if I may use the phrase, which can transmit\ngravitational influence from one gravitating body to another. Never\ntheless, scientific men do not rest content with that view. I recollect\nit used be maintained by the late Mr. John Mill that there was no\nground for regarding with any special wonder the phenomenon of\naction at a distance. I do not dogmatise upon the point, but I do say\nemphatically that I do not think you will find a first-rate physicist\nwho is prepared to admit that gravity is not a phenomenon which stid\nwants an explanation. He is not ready, in other words, to accept\naction at a distance as an ultimate fact, though he has not even got the\nfirst clue to the real nature of the links by which the attracting bodies\nmutually act upon one another.\nBut though gravitation and telepathy are alike in this, that we are\nquite ignorant of the means by which in either case distant bodies in\nfluence one another, it would be a great mistake to suppose that the\ntwo modes of operation are equally mysterious. In the case of tele\npathy there is not merely the difficulty of conjecturing the nature of\nthe mechanism which operates between the agent and the patient,\nbetween the man who influences and the man who is influenced ; but\nthe whole character of the phenomena refuses to fit in with any of our\naccepted ideas as to the mode in which force may be exercised from\none portion of space to another. Is this telepathic action an ordinary\ncase of action from a centre of disturbance 1 Is it equally diffused in\nall directions 1 Is it like the light of a candle or the light of the sun\nwhich radiates equally into space in every direction at the same time 1\nIf it is, it must obey the law\u2014at least, we should expect it to obey the\nlaw\u2014of all other forces which so act through a non-absorbing medium,\nand its effects must diminish inversely as the square of the distance.\nIt must, so to speak, get beaten out thinner and thinner the further\nit gets removed from its original source. But is this so? Is it even\n\fPresident'8 Address. 11\ncredible that the mere thoughts, or, if you please, the neural changes\ncorresponding to these thoughts, of any individual could have in them\nthe energy to produce sensible effects equally in all directions, for\ndistances which do not, as far as our investigations go, appear to have\nany necessary limit ? It is, I think, incredible ; and in any case there\nis no evidence whatever that this equal diffusion actually takes place.\nThe will power, whenever will is used, or the thoughts, in cases where\nwill is not used, have an effect, as a rule, only upon one or two\nindividuals at most. There is no appearance of general diffusion.\nThere is no indication of any disturbance equal at equal distances from\nits origin, and radiating from it alike in every direction.\nBut if we are to reject this idea, which is the first which ordinary\nanalogies would suggest, what are we to put in its place ? Are we to\nsuppose that there is some means by which telepathic energy can be\ndirected through space from the agent to the patient, from the man\nwho influences to the man who is influenced 1 If we are to believe this,\nas apparently we must, we are face to face not only with a fact extra\nordinary in itself, but with a kind of fact which does not fit in with\nanything we know at present in the region either of physics or of\nphysiology. It is true, no doubt, that we do know plenty of cases\nwhere energy is directed along a given line, like water in a pipe, or\nlike electrical energy along the course of a wire. But then in such\ncases there is always some material guide existing between the two\ntermini, between the place from which the energy comes and the\nplace to which the energy goes. Is there any such material guide in the\ncase of telepathy ? It seems absolutely impossible. There is no sign\nof it. We cannot even form to ourselves any notion of its character,\nand yet, if we are to take what appears to be the obvious lesson of\nthe observed facts, we are forced to the conclusion that in some\nshape or other it exists. For to suppose that the telepathic agent\nshoots out his influence towards a particular object, as you shoot a\nbullet out of a gun, or water out of a hose, which appears to be the\nonly other alternative, involves us seemingly in greater difficulties\nstill.\nHere then we are face to face with what I call a scientifically\nextraordinary phenomenon, as distinguished from a dramatically extra\nordinary one. Anyone who has endeavoured to wade through the\nmass of evidence collected by our Society on the subject will be\nprepared to admit that it is not exciting or interesting in itself, that it\ndoes not arouse a foolish wonder, or appeal unduly to any craving for the\nmarvellous. But dull as these experiments may seem, dull indeed as\nthey often are, their dullness is really one of their great advantages. It\neffectually excludes some perturbing influences that might otherwise\naffect, or, which is nearly as bad, be supposed to affect, the cool\n\f12 President's Address.\nanalysis of the experimental data ; and in consequence, it makes these\ninvestigations, in my judgment, the best starting point from which to\nreconsider, should it be necessary, our general view, I will not say\nof the material universe, but of the universe of phenomena in space\nand time.\nI am, of course, aware that probably a very large number, perhaps\nthe majority, of the members of this Society are accustomed to consider\nthe subjects with which we deal from a somewhat different point of\nview from that which I have adopted this afternoon, and it is well that\nthis should be so. All arbitrary limitations of our sphere of work are\nto be avoided. It is our business to record, to investigate, to classify,\nand, if possible, to explain, facts of a far more startling and impressive\ncharacter than these modest cases of telepathy. Let us not neglect\nthat business. And if beyond the mere desire to increase knowledge\nmany are animated by a wish to get evidence, not through any process\nof laborious deduction, but by direct observation, of the reality of\nintelligences not endowed with a physical organisation like our own, I\nsee nothing in their action to criticise, much less to condemn. But\nwhile there is sufficient evidence, in my judgment, to justify all the\nlabours of our Society in this field of research, it is not the field of\nresearch which lies closest to the ordinary subjects of scientific\nstudy, and, therefore, this afternoon, when I was led to deal rather\nwith the scientific aspects of our work, I have deliberately kept myself\nwithin the range of the somewhat unpicturesque phenomena of tele\npathy. My object has been a very simple one, as I am desirous\nabove all things of enlisting in our service the best experimental\nand scientific ability which we can command. I have thought\nit best to endeavour to arrest the attention, and, if possible, to\nengage the interest of men of science by pointing to the definite and\nvery simple experiments which, simple as they are, yet hint at conclu\nsions not easily to be accommodated with our habitual theories of\nthings. If we can repeat these experiments sufficiently often and\nunder .tests sufficiently crucial to exclude the possibility of error, it will\nbe impossible any longer to ignore them, and, willingly or unwillingly,\nall interested in science will be driven to help, as far as they can, to\nunravel the refractory class of problems which this Society is endeavour\ning to solve. What success such efforts will be crowned with, I know\nnot. I have already indicated to you, at the beginning of my remarks,\nthe special class of difficulties which beset our path. We have not at\nour command the appropriate physical senses, we have not the appro\npriate materials for experiment, we are hampered and embarrassed in\nevery direction by credulity, by fraud, by prejudice. Nevertheless, if I\nrightly interpret the results which these many years of labour have\nforced upon the members of this Society and upon others not among\n\fPresident's Address. 13\nour number who are associated by a similar spirit, it does seem to me\nthat there is at least strong ground for supposing that outside the\nworld, as we have, from the point of science, been in the habit of con\nceiving it, there does lie a region, not open indeed to experimental\nobservation in the same way as the more familiar regions of the\nmaterial world are open to it, but still with regard to which some\nexperimental information may be laboriously gleaned ; and even if we\ncannot entertain any confident hope of discovering what laws these\nhalf-seen phenomena obey, at all events it will be some gain to have\nshown, not as a matter of speculation or conjecture, but as a matter\nof ascertained fact, that there are things in heaven and earth not\nhitherto dreamed of in our scientific philosophy. (Cheers.)\n\f14 Professor 0. J. Lodge.\nII.\nON THE DIFFICULTY OF MAKING CRUCIAL EXPERIMENTS\nAS TO THE SOURCE OF THE EXTRA OR UNUSUAL INTEL-\nLIGENCE MANIFESTED IN TRANCE-SPEECH, AUTOMATIC\nWRITING, AND OTHER STATES OF APPARENT MENTAL\nINACTIVITY.\nBy Oliver Lodge, F.R.S.\nIt has long been known that in order to achieve remarkable results\nin any department of intellectual activity, the mind must be to some\nextent unaware of passing occurrences. To be keenly awake and \" on\nthe spot \" is a highly valued accomplishment, and for the ordinary\npurposes of mundane affairs is a far more useful state of mind than the\nrather hazy and absorbed condition which is associated with the quality\nof mind called genius ; but it is not as effective for brilliant achieve\nment.\nWhen a poet or musician or mathematician feels himself inspired,\nhis senses are, I suppose, dulled or half asleep ; and though probably\nsome part of his brain is in a great state of activity, I am not aware\nof any experiments directed to test which that part is, nor whether,\nwhen in that state, any of the more ordinarily used portions are really\ndormant or no. It would be interesting, but difficult, to ascertain the\nprecise physiological accompaniments of that which on a small scale is\ncalled a brown study, and on a larger scale a period of inspiration.\nIt does not seem unreasonable to suppose that the state is some\nwhat allied to the initial condition of ansesthesia\u2014the somnambulic\ncondition when, though the automatic processes of the body go on\nwith greater perfection than usual, the conscious or noticing aspect of\nthe mind is latent, so that the things which influence the person are\napparently no longer the ordinary events which affect his peripheral\norgans, but either something internal or else something not belonging\nto the ordinarily known physical universe at all.\nThe mind is always in a receptive state perhaps, but whereas the\nbusiness-like, wide-awake person receives impressions from every trivial\ndetail of his physical surroundings, the half-asleep person seems to\nreceive impressions from a different stratum altogether ; higher in\nsome instances, lower in some instances, but different always from\nthose received by ordinary men in their every-day state.\nIn a man of genius the state comes on of itself and the results are\nastounding. There exist occasionally feeble persons, usually young,\nwho seek to attain to the appearance of genius by the easy process\n\fOn the Difficulty of Making Crucial Experiments, &c. 15\nof assuming or encouraging an attitude of vacancy and uselessness.\nThere may be all grades of result attained while in this state, and the\nstate itself is of less than no value unless it is justified by the results.\nBy experiment and observation it has now been established that a\nstate very similar to this can be induced by artificial means, e.g., by\ndrugs, by hypnosis, by crystal gazing, by purposed inattention ; and\nalso that the state can occur occasionally without provocation during\nsleep and during trance.\nAll these states seem to some extent allied, and, as is well known,\nMr. Myers has elaborated their relationship in his series of articles on\nthe subliminal consciousness.\nWell now, the question arises, What is the source of the intelli\ngence manifested during epochs of clairvoyant lucidity, as sometimes\nexperienced in the hypnotic or the somnambulic state or during trance,\nor displayed automatically ?\nThe most striking cases of which I am now immediately or\nmediately cognisant, are the trance state of Mrs. Piper and the auto\nmatism of such writers as the wife of the late Rev. P. H. Newnham.1\nWithout any apparent lulling of attention at all I am experimentally\nassured of the possibility of conveying information between one mind\nand another without the aid of ordinary sense organs ; but the cases\nmentioned are especially striking and will serve to narrow the field to\nwhat, after all, may be considered at present the main points.\nMrs. Piper in the trance state is undoubtedly ( I use the word in\nthe strongest sense ; I have absolutely no more doubt on the subject\nthan I have of any friend's ordinary knowledge of me and other men),\n\u2014Mrs. Piper's trance personality is undoubtedly aware of much to\nwhich she has no kind of ordinarily recognised clue, and of which\nin her ordinary state she knows nothing. But how does she get\nthis knowledge? She herself when in the .trance state asserts that\nshe gets it by conversing with the deceased friends and relatives of\npeople present. And that this is a genuine opinion of hers, i.e., that\nthe process feels like that to her unconscious or subconscious mind, the\npart of her which calls itself Phinuit, I am fully prepared to believe.\nBut that does not carry us very far towards a knowledge of what the\nprocess actually is.\nConversation implies speaking with the mouth, and when receiving\nor asking information she is momentarily in a deeper slumber, and\ncertainly not occupied in speech. At times, indeed, slight mutterings of\none-sided questions and replies are heard, very like the mutterings of a\nperson in sleep undergoing a vivid dream.\nDream is certainly the ordinary person's nearest approach to the\n1 Phantasms of the lAvina, Vol. I. p. 63.\n\f16 Professor 0. J. Lodge.\nPhinuit condition, and the fading of recollection as the conscious\nmemory returns is also paralleled by the waking of Mrs. Piper out of\nthe trance. But, instead of a nearly passive dream, it is more\nnearly allied to the somnambulic state, though the activity, far from\nbeing chiefly locomotory, is mainly mental and only partially muscular.\nShe is in a state of somnambulism in which the mind is more active\nthan the body ; and the activity is so different from her ordinary\nactivity, she is so distinctly a different sort of person, that she quite\nappropriately calls herself by another name.\nIt is natural to ask, Is she still herself ? but it is a question difficult\nto answer, unless \" herself \" be defined. It is her mouth that is\nspeaking, and I suppose her brain and nerves are working the oral\nmuscles, but they are not worked in the customary way, nor does the\nmind manifested thereby at all resemble her mind. Until, however,\nthe meaning of identity can be accurately specified, I find it difficult\nto discuss the question whether she or another person is really\nspeaking.\nOn this point the waking experience of Mrs. Newnham and of\nother automatic writers is of assistance.\nIn their case the mouth does not speak, but the hand writes ; and\nit writes matter not in the writer's mind and which he does not feel\nthat he is writing. His hand is writing and he is in some cases\ntaking the attention of his own conscious mind away from his hand and\nletting it be guided by his subconscious or by some other mind.\nThe instructive feature about this phenomenon is that the minds\napparently influencing the hand are not so much those of dead as of living\npeople. The great advantage of this is that they can be catechised\nafterwards about their share in the transaction ; and it then appears\nthat although the communication purporting to be from them really\ndoes convey what they were doing or thinking, in fact what they miglU\nhave written, yet actually they know nothing about the writing,\nneither the muscular fact nor the intelligent substance. It does not do\nto jump to the conclusion that this will always be the case ; that the\nconnection is never consciously reciprocal, as when two persons are\ntalking ; but it shows that at any rate it need not be so. Since the\nliving communicant is not aware of the fact that he is dictating\nthe handwriting, so the dead person need not be consciously opera\ntive ; and thus conceivably the hand of the automatist may be\ninfluenced by minds other than his own, minds both living and dead\n(by one apparently as readily as by the other), but not by a con\nscious portion of the mind of anyone ; by the subconscious or dreamy\nportion, if by any portion at all.\nWhen Phinuit then, or Mrs. Piper in the trance state, reports con\nversations which she has had with other minds (usually in Phinuit's\n\fOn the Difficulty of Making Crucial Experiments, &c. 17\ncase with persons deceased), and even when the voice changes and\nmessages come apparently from those very people themselves, it does\nnot follow that they themselves are necessarily aware of the fact, nor\nneed their conscious mind (if they have any) have anything whatever\nto do with the process.\nThe signature of an automatist's hand is equivalent to the asser\ntion that Miss X., for instance, is deliberately writing ; Phinuit's\nstatement is equally an assertion that Mr. E. is deliberately speaking ;\nand the one statement may be no more a lie than the other is a\nforgery, and yet neither need be what is ordinarily called \" true.\"\nThat this community of mind or possibility of distant interchange\nor one-sided reception of thoughts exists, is to me perfectly clear and\ncertain. I venture further to say that persona who deny the bare fact,\nexpressed as I here wish to express it without any hypothesis, are\nsimply ignorant. They have not studied the facts of the subject. It\nmay be for lack of opportunity, it may be for lack of inclination ; they\nare by no means bound to investigate it unless they choose ; but any\ndogmatic denials which such persons may now perpetrate will hence\nforth, or in the very near future, redound to the discredit, not of the\nphenomena thus ignorantly denied, but of themselves, the over\nconfident and presumptuous deniers.\nWe must not too readily assume that the apparent action of one\nmind on another is really such an action. The impression received\nmay come from the ostensible agent, but it may come from a third\nperson ; or again it may, as some think more likely, come from some\ncentral mind or Zeitgeist, to which all ordinary minds are related and\nby which they are influenced. If it could be shown that the action is\na syntonic or sympathetic connection between a pair of minds, then it\nmight be surmised that the action is a physical one, properly to be\nexpressed as occurring directly between brain and brain, or body and\nbody. On the other hand, the action may conceivably be purely\npsychological, and the distant brain may be stimulated not by the\nintervention of anything physical or material but in some more\nimmediate manner, from its psychological instead of from its physio\nlogical side.\nThe question is quite a definite one if properly expressed : Does\nthe action take place through a physical medium or does it not 1\nGuesses at a priori likelihood are absolutely worthless ; if the\nquestion is to be answered it must be attacked experimentally.\nNow the ordinary way in which A communicates with B is through\na certain physical mechanism, and the thought of A may be said to\nexist for a finite time as an etherial or aerial quiver before it repro\nduces a similar thought in the mind of B. We have got so accus\ntomed to the existence of this intermediate physical process that\no\n\f18 Professor 0. J. Lodge.\ninstead of striking us as roundabout and puzzling it appeals to us as\nnatural and simple ; and any more direct action of A on B, without a\nphysical mechanism, is scouted as absurd or at least violently impro\nbable. Well, it is merely a question of fact, and perhaps it is within\nthe range of a crucial experiment.\nBut it may be at once admitted that such an experiment is difficult\nof execution. If the effect is a physical one it should vary according\nto some law of distance, or it should depend on the nature of the\nintervening medium ; but in order to test whether in any given case\nsuch variation occurs it is necessary to have both agent and percipient\nin an unusually dependable condition, and they should if possible be\nunaware of the variation which is under test.\nThis last condition is desirable because of the sensitiveness of the\nsub-consciousness to suggestion : self-suggestion and other. If the per\ncipient got an idea that distance or interposed screens were detrimental,\nmost likely they would be detrimental ; and although a suggestion might\nbe artificially instilled that distance was advantageous, this would hardly\nleave the test quite fair, for the lessened physical stimulus might perhaps\nbe over-utilised by the more keenly excited organism. Still that is an\nexperiment to be tried among others ; and it would be an instructive\nexperience if the agent some day was, say, in India when the per\ncipient thought he was in London, or vice versd.\nIt is extremely desirable to probe this question of a physical or\nnon-physical mode of communication in cases of telepathy, and if the\nfact can be established beyond doubt that sympathetic communication\noccurs between places as distant as India or America and England, or,\nsay, the terrestrial antipodes, being unfelt between, or in the neigh\nbourhood of the source, then I should feel that this was so unlike what\nwe are accustomed to in Physics that I should be strongly urged to\nlook to some other and more direct kind of mental relationship as the\nclue.\nThis, then, is the first question on which crucial experiments are\ndesirable though difficult.\n(1) Is the mechanism of telepathy physical or not 1\nThe second question of which I am thinking is one less easy to state\nand far less easy (as I think) to resolve. It may be stated thus, in\ntwo parts, or as two separate questions :\u2014\n(2) Is the power of operating on the minds of terrestrial persons\nconfined to living terrestrial people ?\n(3) Is the power of operating on or interfering with the rest of the\nphysical universe confined to living material bodies 1\nI should conjecture that an affirmative answer to Question 1 would\nrender likely an affirmative answer to Questions 2 and 3 ; but that a\nnegative answer to Question 1 would leave 2 and 3 entirely open,\n\fOn the Difficulty of Making Crucial Experiments, i\u00a3c. 19\nbecause, so far as we at present know, terrestrial people and people with\nmaterial bodies may be the only people who exist.\nIt is this possibility, or, as many would hold, probability or almost\ncertainty, that renders the strict scientific statement of Questions\n2 and 3 so difficult. Yet they are questions which must be faced, and\nthey ought to be susceptible in time of receiving definite answers.\nThat there are living terrestrial people we know, we also know that\nthere is an immense variety of other terrestrial life ; though, if we were\nnot so familiar with the fact, the luxuriant prevalence and variety\nof life would be surprising. The existence of a bat, for instance, or a\nlobster would be quite incredible. Whether there is life on other\nplanets we do not know, and whether there is conscious existence\nbetween the planets we do not know ; but I see no a priori reason for\nmaking scientific assertions on the subject one way or the other. It\nis only at present a matter of probability. Just because we know that\nthe earth is peopled with an immense variety of living beings, I\nmyself should rather expect to find other regions many-peopled, and\nwith a still more extraordinary variety. So also since mental action is\nconspicuous on the earth I should expect to find it existent elsewhere.\nIf life is necessarily associated with a material carcase then no doubt\nthe surface of one of the many lumps of matter must be the scene\nof its activity ; but if any kind of mental action is independent of\nmaterial or physical environment then it may conceivably be that the\npsychical population is not limited to the material lumps, but may\nluxuriate either in the interstellar spaces or in some undimensional\nform of existence of which we have no conception.\n\"Were it not for the fact of telepathy the entire question would be\nan idle one, a speculation based on nothing and apparently incapable\nof examination, still less of verification or disproof.\nBut granted the fact of telepathy the question ceases to be an idle\none, because it is just possible that these other intelligences, if they in\nany sense exist, may be able to communicate with us by the same sort\nof process as that by which we are now learning to be able to commu\nnicate with each other.\nWhether it be true or not, it has been constantly and vehemently\nasserted as a fact that such communications, mainly from deceased\nrelatives, but often also from strangers, are occasionally received by\nliving persons.\nThe utterances of Phinuit, the handwriting of Miss A.. Mr.\nStainton Moses, and others, abound with communications purporting\nto come from minds not now associated with terrestrial matter.\nVery well then ; is a crucial or test experiment possible to settle\nwhether this claim is well founded or not t\nMere sentimental messages, conveying personal traits of the\nc 2\n\f20 Professor 0. J. Lodge.\ndeceased, though frequently convincing to surviving friends, cannot\nbe allowed much scientific weight. Something more definite or\ngenerally intelligible must be sought.\nOf such facts the handwriting of the deceased person, if reproduced\naccurately by an automatist who has never seen that handwriting, seems\nan exceptionally good test if it can be obtained. But the negative proof\nof ignorance on the part of the writer may be difficult.\nAt first sight facts known to the deceased but not known to the\nautomatist, if reported in a correct and detailed manner so as to\nsurpass mere coincidence, would seem a satisfactory test, but here\ntelepathy, which has stood us in good stead so far, begins to\noperate the other way ; for if the facts are known to nobody on earth\nthey cannot perhaps be verified, and if they are known to somebody\nstill alive\u2014however distant he may be\u2014it is necessary to assume\nit possible that they were unconsciously telepathed from his mind.\nBut a certain class of facts may be verified without the assistance\nor knowledge of any living person, as when a miser having died with\nthe sole clue to a deposit of \" valuables,\" an automatist's hand, over\nthe miser's signature, subsequently describes the place; or when\na sealed document, carefully deposited, is posthumously deciphered ;\nthe test in either of these cases is a better one. But still, living\ntelepathy of a deferred kind is not excluded (though to my thinking it\nis rendered extremely improbable), for, as Mr. Podmore has often\nurged, the person writing the document or burying the treasure\nmay have been ipso facto an unconscious agent on the minds of\ncontemporaries.\nPostponement of the apparently posthumous action for more than a\ncentury, so that all contemporaries are necessarily dead, strains this\nsort of telepathic explanation still more\u2014in fact to breaking point; but\nsuch an event is hardly within the reach of purposed experiment : the\nother is ; and responsible people ought to write and deposit specific\ndocuments, for the purpose of posthumously communicating them to\nsomeone if they can, taking all reasonable precautions against fraud and\ncollusion ; and also, which is perhaps a considerable demand, taking\ncare that they do not forget the contents themselves.\nBut after all, even if this were successfully achieved, the proof\nto us of mental action on the part of the deceased \"agent\" is still\nincomplete, for it may be that telepathy is not the right kind of\nexplanation of these things at all ; it may be that they are done\nby clairvoyance ; that the document, though still sealed or enclosed\nin metal, is read in some unknown or fourth-dimensional manner by\nthe subliminal self.\nThe existence of such a power as this, however, can be separately\ntested, because, if straightforward clairvoyance is possible, things un\n\fOn the Difficulty of Making Crucial Experiments, i\u00a3c. 21\nknown to any person living or dead may be read or inspected. And in\ntrying this experiment a negative conclusion must not be jumped at\ntoo readily. A positive answer might be definite enough ; a negative\nanswer can only be a probability. Moreover, it would be wise not to\ntell an automatist who is endeavouring to decipher the unknown\nfigures that in that collocation they have never been inspected by\nman, lest the knowledge should act as a gratuitously hostile or debili\ntating suggestion.\nAs to the third question I must defer its consideration, as this\npaper is too long. I pass to a fourth :\u2014\n(4) Is it possible to become aware of events before they have\noccurred?\nThe anticipation of future events is a power not at all necessarily\nto be expected on a Spiritistic or any other hypothesis ; it is a\nseparate question and will have important bearings of its own. An\nanswer to this Question 4 in the affirmative would vitally affect our\nmetaphysical notions of \" Time,\" but they will not of necessity have an\nimmediate bearing on the existence in the universe of intelligences\nother than our own. A cosmic picture gallery (as Mr. Myers calls it),\nor photographic or phonographic record of all that has occurred or will\noccur in the universe, may conceivably in some sense exist, and may be\npartly open and dimly decipherable to the lucid part of the automatist's\nor entranced person's mind.\nBut the question for us now is whether we can obtain clear and\nunmistakable proof of the existence of this foreseeing power in any\nform. It is not an easy thing to establish beyond any kind of doubt.\nCasual and irresponsible critics (like Mr. Taylor Innes in the Nineteenth\nCentury) frequently urge that documentary evidence, such as a post\nmark on a letter which detailed an event either not yet happened or\ncertainly not known by ordinary methods at the date of the postmark\n(like a recent shipwreck in mid-ocean for instance), would be proof\npositive to them of something occult. Mr. Innes goes so far\nas to say that a document thus officially verified by a Post Office\nclerk would be worth thousands of pounds to the British Museum.\nIf so it would be singularly easy to get rich. I believe that a postmark\non an envelope would satisfy some of these critics, but a postmark on\nthe document itself would be entirely convincing.\nI wonder some enterprising Pigott has not endeavoured to gull a\nleading journal by an elaborate account, say, of the Victoria disaster,\nor the Santander explosion, written on foolscap paper transmitted blank\nthrough the post, at small cost, in preparation for any such striking\nevent ; or perhaps on paper subsequently covered with previous post\nmarks by a genial Post Office friend, and decorated with red tape by a\nlive Government clerk !\n\f22 Processor 0. J. Lodge.\nThe feeling that everything done by a Post Office official is conclu\nsive is of the same order as the opinion that barristers or criminal\njudges or medical practitioners are the only people fit to investigate\nunusual mental phenomena, because their practice makes them familiar\nwith the warpings of the human mind.\nBut to consider the case of a medical practitioner ; as I understand\na doctor's business, it is to cure an abnormality if he can, not to pro\nlong and investigate it. True, a doctor may be a scientific man in ad\ndition, but qua physician he is out of his element as a general investi\ngator, and as a leading practitioner he has very little spare time. Were\nit not so, the record against the profession\u2014the attitude the main body\nof doctors has taken to everything new\u2014would be not only pitiful, as\nit is, but essentially disgraceful.\nTo this day I feel sure that many promising subjects, some for in\nvestigation and some for psychical cure, are being lost both to science\nand to themselves within the walls of our asylums.\nBut about this question of postmarks. Let it not be thought that\nI claim that their evidence is worthless. As evidence subsidiary to\ntestimony they may be very valuable, and every effort should be made\nto get them ; my contention only is that they do not dispense with\ntestimony.\nThis I hold is the function of all circumstantial evidence, or of any\nautomatic record ; it lessens the chance of self-delusion or over-exuberant\nimagination, it can never can be held to guard against fraud.\nIf a couple of friends by interchanging letters, with their dates\nverified in some cold blooded official manner, are able to establish\nforeknowledge of events such as could hardly be guessed or inferred,\nthentheir testimony is strengthened by the date marks to this extent :\u2014\nEither the things happened as they say, or they are in some sort\nof collusion to bear false witness and deceive. One could only grant\nthem the loophole of self-deception on the alternative of something\nvery like insanity.\nThat is how these automatic records, photographs and the like, may\nbe so valuable\u2014as supplementary to human testimony\u2014never as sub\nstitutes for it.\nA word before concluding as to Question 3, whether direct mental\naction can ever physically affect matter.\nConspicuously it can affect and move some matter, viz., the matter\nforming part of a living organism ; but is it possible to move dead or\ninorganic matter without contact, direct or indirect, between our\nbodies and it ; that is, in short, without any recognised medium of con\nnection or known method of action ?\nCan an entranced or any other person raise a chair or table with\nout pressing it up and without conjuring ?\n\fOn the Difficulty of Making Crucial Experiments, dc. 23\nAssertions that such events publicly occur are innumerable, and\nthe recognised possible explanation, after fraud and imposture are\neliminated (not by any means an easy matter), is collective hallucina\ntion or collective hypnotism by the operator. This is supposed to be\nguarded against by photography. If a person with a camera could\nphotograph the table while in the air with nobody touching it, or\nwith only a few persons standing free and holding their fingers down\nwards to it, a sceptic would be satisfied. But ought he to be\nsatisfied 1\nA crucial experiment is seldom so easy as that; True, one is not\nlikely to be able to hypnotise a photographic plate, but if a company\ncan be hallucinated so as to see the table rise where it does not rise,\nthey can likewise be hypnotised not to Bee the operator place con\nvenient plate-glass supports under the table legs just before the photo\ngraphic gentleman is ready to begin.\n[Photographs of a table in the open air and off the ground without\nvisible means of support were here shown.]\nSo also with Indian jugglery. If the audience cannot be trusted\nto perceive what they see (and I by no means say that they can),\nneither can the bald record of the camera be trusted, with all ante\ncedent circumstances omitted or at best given in patches.\nOf all the many defects of observation, that of lapsed attention is\none to which the camera is pre-eminently subject. A camera simply\ncannot look continuously, at the best it can only take a series of\ntableaux vivants, and for all the intervening acts we are dependent on\ntestimony.\nA crucial experiment in this case also is difficult, and for myself I\nwould prefer to trust my own observation rather than any amount of\nsecond-hand testimony, fortified by the assurance of any number of\nKodaks.\nI do not say, therefore, that photographic records are useless : as\nsupplementary evidence they may be highly valuable and they should\nalways be obtained when possible. All these experiments should be\ntried, and their concurrent evidence may do much, though their in\ndividual cogency is incomplete.\nSo also it may be desirable to get a phonographic record of the\nspeech of a ghost, if it can be done. But (even eliminating fraud)\nthere would be nothing crucial about it, unless one can be sure that the\nghost-seer has not in a somnambulic state spoken the necessary words\ninto the instrument itself.\nMeanwhile, it seems to me probable that in this department of\nscience, as in every other, the wholesome and valuable part of scep\nticism will ultimately be broken down, if at all, not by any one conclu\nsive experiment, but by converging lines of testimony coming in from\n\f24 Professor 0. J. Lodge.\nmany and unexpected quarters ; and the breach will be assisted by the\ngradual perception that such psychical actions as are proved to occur are\nnot portents or ruptures in the order of nature but are natural and simple\noutgrowths from what science already knows ; they are first-fruits from\na promised land which has been seen from the hills but has not yet\nbeen explored.\nIt is a most unpardonable blunder for a scientific man to suppose\nthat everything that can be known is already more or less within his\ncognisance ; and his least justifiable attitude is that which holds that\nthere are certain departments of truth in the universe which it is not\nlawful to investigate.\nThe same Lord Kelvin who, in a moment of aberration (I hope),\nwrote this very year that \" one-half of hypnotism and clairvoyance is\nimposture and the rest bad observation,\"1 uttered also the worthier\nsentiment that \" Science is bound by the everlasting law of honour to\nface fearlessly every problem which can fairly be presented to it.\"2\n1 Stead's Borderland.

Report\n1871, or \"Popular Lectures and Addresses,' (Macmillan), Vol. II., p. 200.\n\fReport on the Census of Hallucinations. 25\nIII.\nREPORT ON THE CENSUS OF HALLUCINATIONS.\nChapter L\nINTRODUCTORY.\nThe statistical inquiry into the spontaneous hallucinations of the\nsane, of which the results are here given, was undertaken in 1889\nby the Committee which now presents its final report. It will\nbe convenient, for brevity, to refer to this inquiry as \"The Census.\"\nThe undertaking received the approval of the International Congress\nof Experimental Psychology, held in Paris in 1889 under the\npresidency of Professor Ribot ; and, in its present form, the inquiry\nmay be said to date from this Congress, which formally entrusted it to\nProfessor Sidgwick's direction.\nFor though, as we shall presently explain, the investigation was\noriginally started with a special view to the aims of the Society for\nPsychical Research, the interest taken in it at this general Congress of\nExperimental Psychologists led the Committee somewhat to enlarge its\nscope. Accordingly, in tabulating our returns and stating the general\nconclusions that may be drawn from them, we have taken pains to note,\nand treated more fully than we should otherwise have done, such\npoints as seemed likely to interest psychologists generally who might\nbe studying the phenomenon of hallucination,\u2014apart from the special\nquestion of the \" veridicality \" of some hallucinations, on which the\nCensus was primarily designed to throw light.\nWe were confirmed in our choice of this more comprehensive treat\nment of our results by our experience of the labour involved in the\ninvestigation ; which renders it, in our opinion, very doubtful whether\nany equally extensive statistical inquiry into the characteristics and\nconditions of this class of phenomena will ever again be undertaken,\nunless with some such special interest as that which prompted our\nresearches.\nThe plan of our Report, thus enlarged in its scope, divides itself\nnaturally into three parts. First, in Chapters II. and III., we explain\nthe method of inquiry, present the chief statistical results in a tabular\nform, and then give a full discussion of possible sources of error and\nendeavour to estimate the extent of their operation. Then\u2014in\nChapters IV.-XI. inclusive\u2014we deal mainly with topics interesting to\npsychologists generally, and only connected in a subordinate way with\n\f26 [chap.\nReport on the Census of Hallucinations.\nthe primary aim of our inquiry. We discuss the characteristics by which\nsensory hallucinations are to be distinguished from cognate phenomena,\nespecially from mere illusions of the senses : the chief forms of\nhallucinations\u2014especially of the visual type\u2014and the stages in which\nthey are sometimes developed : the physiological processes involved in\nthem and their physical effects on percipients so far as reported : and\nthe influence, favourable or the reverse, of certain general physical con\nditions,\u2014such as age, sex, health and heredity\u2014and certain special men\ntal conditions such as grief, anxiety, nervous overstrain, abstraction,\nand expectancy. Then, finally, in Chapter XII., we enter upon the\nspecial subject which supplied the original motive for undertaking the\nwork of the Census, and justifies its publication in these Proceedings,\u2014\nthe examination of the evidence for telepathy furnished by the results\nof the present inquiry ; and from this point to the end of the Report\nour attention is concentrated on that portion of our phenomena which\nthere is\u2014or may appear to be\u2014any reason to refer to a supernormal\ncause.\nIn order to explain clearly the principal question on which we endeav\nour to throw light in this concluding portion of the Report, it will be\nconvenient briefly to review the whole evidence for telepathy hitherto\ncollected by our Society, so as to show the relation of this particular\nquestion to the general course of our investigations.\nThe word Telepathy was brought into use by us to express the\n(scientifically speaking) novel conclusion\u2014which several different lines\nof inquiry have tended to establish\u2014that thoughts and feelings in one\nmind are sometimes caused by the influence of another mind, conveyed\nsomehow otherwise than through the recognised channels of sense. The\nword by its derivation suggests that the influence in question operates\nacross a considerable distance of space : and this is ordinarily the case\nin the instances of telepathic phenomena with which the present\nReport is concerned ; but it has been found convenient to use the term,\nfor scientific purposes, as merely connoting the exclusion of recognised\nchannels of sensation, and not necessarily implying any definite\ninterval of space between the persons whose states of mind are\ntelepathically connected.\nNow, there can be no doubt that the general acceptance of\nTelepathy, in this sense, as a fact of nature, must importantly modify\nthe current scientific view of the relation of mind to matter. But it\nmay conceivably modify this view in either of two different ways,\nrespectively important in very different degrees.\n(a) It may lead to the ultimate discovery of some physical process\nhitherto unknown, by which the psychical state of one human l)eing (A)\ninfluences the psychical state of another human being (B) through the\ncorresponding physical states of the two human organisms concerned.\n\fReport on the Census of Hallucinations. 27\nOr \\b), it may lead ultimately to the conclusion that the causal\nrelation between the two psychical facts telepathically connected is\nindependent of any such physical process.\nIt is obvious that the modification of received views involved in the\nacceptance of the second alternative would be far greater and more\nfundamental than that involved in the acceptance of the first. We\nmay therefore assume that, if the fact of telepathy were once accepted\nby the scientific world as completely established, the efforts of scientific\nmen to explain the fact would\u2014at any rate at first\u2014take the direction\nsuggested by the first alternative : i.e., they would try to discover the\nphysical process involved in telepathy,\u2014unless, indeed, other strange\nfacts should be simultaneously established clearly cognate to telepathy,\nand clearly not admitting of any such physical explanation.\nBut we now refer to this only to say that no attempt of this kind\u2014to\ndiscover the physical basis of telepathy\u2014has been made in the present\nReport : since no indication of any such basis, or of the direction\nin which (if at all) it is to be sought, appears to us to be afforded by\nany of the lines of investigation so far pursued,\u2014including such\nexamination as the present inquiry has enabled us to make of the\nempirical causes and concomitants of hallucinations. In dealing there\nfore with the hallucinations primd facie telepathic, reported to us\nin the course of the Census, we have been mainly concerned to examine\ncarefully their value as evidence of the general fact that the psychical\nstate of one human being may influence the psychical state of another,\nunder conditions which satisfactorily exclude all knouni physical\nprocesses by which such influence might be conveyed.\nNow, when we consider, from this evidential point of view, the\nwhole work of investigation carried on by our Society, we find\nthat it has divided itself into two main parts: (1) Experiments on\npersons primdfacie susceptible of telepathic influence, whether in the\nhypnotic or in a normal condition ; and (2) the collection and exami\nnation of accounts of phenomena primd facie telepathic, which have\nbeen produced not experimentally, but spontaneously. It will easily\nbe understood that the problems presented by these two lines of\ninvestigation are to a great extent dissimilar. For the most part\u2014\nthough, as will presently appear, not entirely\u2014it has been only found\npossible to perform telepathic experiments successfully when the\npersons between whom the telepathic influence operates are separated\nby a comparatively small interval of space ; and in such cases it has\nusually been a matter of some difficulty to render the exclusion of\nknown processes of sense quite certam. And this has often been the\nonly difficulty : since, in the experiments which we regard as successful,\nit is often quite obviously undeniable that there is some causal\nconnexion between the similar ideas in the two minds concerned ; the\n\f28 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nonly possible question is whether that causal connexion is telepathic.\nThe opposite is more often the case with the non-experimental\nevidence ; the distance between the two persons concerned is often so\ngreat that if any causal connexion can be established between a\nparticular experience of one mind and the corresponding experience of\nanother\u2014say, between the death of A. in England, and the apparition\nof A. to B. in Australia\u2014there will be no dispute that the causation\nlies outside the ordinary channels of sense. Thus, while practically the\nmain point in experimenting is to exclude known modes of causation,\nthe main point in dealing with the non-experimental evidence is to\nascertain whether there is any causal connexion at all.\nIt should be added that in the former case the psychical effect\ntelepathically produced is in most cases not a hallucination : whereas\nin the latter case hallucinations constitute the larger part of the\nphenomena irrimd facie referable to telepathy, and the part that is,\ngenerally speaking, evidentially most important.\nThe difference between these two portions of our evidence is so\nmarked that some critics, not altogether unfriendly to our investi\ngations, have been disposed to regard as forced and artificial the\nconnexion that we have tried to establish between them. \" Granted,\"\nthey say, \" that you have managed to transfer diagrams and numbers\nin some unknown way to the mind of a person sitting a few feet off :\ngranted, again, that your well-attested appearances of dying persons to\nfriends in remote places can hardly be explained as merely subjective\nhallucinations : still, the phenomena are too dissimilar in their nature\nand circumstances to justify even a hypothetical reference of them to\nthe same cause.\"\nTo this objection there are two answers. Firstly, apparitions or\nother sensory hallucinations are not the only kind of spontaneous\nexperiences-in which the influence of one mind on another is found\noperating at a distance far beyond the limits within which our suc\ncessful experiments in telepathy are ordinarily confined. A number of\ninstances may be found in Phantasms of the Living (Chaps.V.\u2014VII.) of\nsensations, emotional states, ideas and mental images, and impulses to\naction, produced in a manner which can hardly be regarded as other\nthan telepathic, if telepathy be once admitted as a real cause. It\nis true that these phenomena are, for the most part, evidentially less\nimportant than those with which we are concerned in the present\nReport ; but they cannot be disregarded in considering the whole\nevidence for telepathy, and they form a natural link between the\nspontaneous hallucinations and the experimental cases of thought-\ntransference.\nA more important link, however, is furnished by a portion of our\nexperimental evidence\u2014comparatively small in bulk but good in\n\fl] Report on the Census of Hallucinations. 29\nquality\u2014which has a special affinity to the subject of the present\ninquiry. We refer to cases in which the percipient sees an apparition\nof some one who is trying to transfer an idea of himself\u2014or of some\nother human being\u2014to the percipient's mind, without any previous\nknowledge on the part of the latter that such an attempt was being\nmade. There are 15 successful experiments of this kind already\nrecorded by our Society, in which ten different experimenters have\ntaken a part : the records are all at first-hand, and in every case the\nevidence of the percipient has been obtained, as well as that of the\nexperimenter. Thirteen of these experiments were made during the\nyears 1878-1890, and were recorded less than 2 years after the event ;\nand in 6 of them a record was made, either by the experimenter\nbefore learning the result of the experiment, or by the percipient while\nignorant that an experiment had been made. It is also noteworthy\nthat seven out of the ten experimenters appear to have succeeded on\nthe first trial.1\nThe experiments may be divided into three classes. (1) In the\ngreat majority of cases the experimenter was trying to make himself\nvisible to the percipient, at or near the time at which the effect was\nproduced on the latter. But (2) there are two cases in which the\npercipient saw an apparition of the experimenter when the latter was\nmerely trying to make the percipient think of him : and these are\nnoteworthy as having a closer resemblance than the first class to the\nordinary non-experimental apparitions of living persons. (3) Finally,\nwe have an old, but well \"attested, record of a unique case, in which\nthe experimenter transferred to two percipients an apparition of\na third person. An account of this case was given in our Pro\nceedings, Part XVI., Vol. VI., p. 287 : it is interesting as present\ning more than one point of analogy to certain classes of spontaneous\napparitions, which at first sight appear not easily susceptible of a\ntelepathic explanation, though it is difficult to regard them as purely\nsubjective.\nAn examination of these experimentally produced hallucinations\nwill, we think, render it easier to enter into the point of view from\nwhich we regard the non-experimental evidence for telepathy with\n1 Ten of these cases are recorded in Phantasms of the Living (see Vol. I.; p.\nknxi. and pp. 103-109, and Vol. II., pp. 671, 675) ; and five in the Journal of the\nS.P.R. (see Vol. III., p. 307, Vol IV., p. 218, and pp. 321-326, and Vol. V., pp.\n23-4). The two cases last mentioned are included in the Census, and will be found in\nChap. XIV. It is noteworthy that, in the majority of these cases, the experimenter\nwas either asleep or hypnotised when his apparition was seen, having fallen asleep (or\ninto the hypnotic state) with his mind fixed on the determination to appear.\nIt may be added that, while this Chapter was passing through the press, we\nreceived information of another successful attempt of the same kind.\n\f30 [chap.\nReport on the Census of Hallucinations.\nwhich the present Report is concerned. This evidence consists\u2014as has\nbeen indicated\u2014largely, though not solely, of accounts of apparitions\nof human beings, who are afterwards ascertained to have been dying\u2014\nor passing through some crisis other than death\u2014elsewhere, at or\nabout the time at which the apparition is seen ; the seer of the\napparition not having at the time any knowledge of this fact, other\nthan what is conveyed by the apparition itself. We speak of these\nphenomena as \" coincidental \" or \" veridical \" hallucinations. The\nlatter of the two terms has been sometimes criticised, on the ground\nthat the meaning of the adjective is inconsistent with the received\nsense of the substantive ; but it seems to us that the combination\nexactly expresses the mingling of truth and error in the apparent\nperception of objective fact which the phenomenon involves. We\nregard the phenomenon as a \" hallucination,\" because it is an apparent\nperception of a body occupying a portion of space, under conditions\nwhich render it unreasonable to suppose that this portion of space\nreally was so occupied : at the same time, we call it a \" veridical\nhallucination,\" because, so far as it suggests that the person in question\nis dying or passing through some other crisis at the time, it repre\nsents a real fact otherwise unknown to the percipient.\nWe need hardly remind our readers that the labours of our Society\nduring the last twelve years have brought before the world a consider\nable number of such experiences, recorded at first hand and with\ncorroboration by intelligent witnesses whose good faith is unim-\npeached. And they will now, I trust, be wiUing to regard it as at least\nan obvious and natural explanation of these phenomena, when\nconsidered in the light of the experiments before described, to suppose\nthat the apparition is an effect somehow telepathically caused by the\ncontemporaneous crisis in the life of the person that it represents ;\nin the same manner as the experimentally induced hallucination is\nsomehow telepathically caused by the attempt of the experimenter to\ninfluence the percipient. Certainly, if all hallucinations that occur other\nwise than experimentally were as clearly veridical or coincidental as\nmany that have been narrated in our publications, this explanation\u2014\nor some other equally alien to the view of ordinary science\u2014would be\nseen to be inevitable : since in that case it would be evident, at first\nsight, that the coincidence of these numerous hallucinations, occurring\nquite independently of one another, with critical events in the lives of\nthe persons represented could not possibly be due to chance. But this\nis not the case: common experience makes us familiar with the fact\nthat similar apparitions of living persons occur when nothing particular\nis happening to the persons that they represent. Let us call these\n\" non-coincidental \" : it is easily seen that if they are sufficiently\nnumerous in proportion to the veridical or coincidental ones, the\n\fI.] Report on the Census of Hallucinations. 31\ncoincidences in the latter class of cases may be reasonably regarded as\npurely accidental, and could furnish no evidence for telepathy. Before,\ntherefore, we can come to a final conclusion as to the telepathic\ncharacter of these phenomena, we must form some estimate of the\nproportion of non-coincidental to coincidental cases.\nThis is the point of view from which the question was treated in\nPhantasms of the Living, Chap. XIII.. Here, in arguing against the\ntheory of chance coincidence, as applied to apparitions primdfacie\nveridical, Mr. Gurney employed a calculation framed on the basis of a\nCensus similar to ours ; and obtained the result that chance could\nnot account for the number of coincidences. He was, however, unable\nto obtain answers from more than 5,705 persons,\u2014a number too\nsmall to enable him to draw inferences as to the proportion of\ncoincidental cases from these answers alone. Accordingly, in order\nto arrive at a conclusion, while he inferred the frequency of sub\njective hallucinations within a certain period of time from his Census,\nhe had to infer the frequency of coincidental hallucinations from\nthe best-authenticated cases given in Phantasms of tlie Living, making\ncertain assumptions as to the size of the circle from which all the\ncases there given were drawn. It was always his wish that a more\nextensive inquiry should be undertaken, by which a sufficient number\nof answers might be obtained to enable the investigator to infer the\ngeneral proportion of coincidental to non-coincidental cases from\nthese answers alone. The number of our informants in the present\nCensus is, we think, sufficiently large to justify us in adopting this\nsimpler and more satisfactory method ; which is, accordingly, applied\nin Chapters XII. and XIII. of the present Report, to that group\nof coincidental cases in respect of which the probability of chance\ncoincidence is capable of being calculated with numerical exactness.\nThen, in Chapter XIV., we illustrate and discuss the rest of the\nevidence for telepathy furnished by our Census. In Chapter XV., we\ndeal with the cases of shared\u2014or, as we find it convenient to call it,\ncollective\u2014hallucination, the explanation of which presents peculiar\ndifficulties. Finally, in Chapters XVI. and XVII., we consider how\nfar the operation of other causes of a supernormal kind is required to\nexplain any part of the phenomena reported to us.\nIt only remains to explain how the labour and responsibility of our\nwork has been distributed among different members of the Committee.\nThe Report has been in the main drawn up by Mrs. Sidgwick and\nMiss Johnson, with special assistance from Professor Sidgwick, who has\nacted throughout as Chairman of the Committee. But the plan on\nwhich it has been drawn up was considered and determined, in a series\nof meetings, by the Committee jointly, who also discussed together the\nevidential value of the cases primd facie telepathic : and the other\n\f32 Report on the Census of Hallucinations.\nmembers of the Committee\u2014Mr. Myers and Mr. Podmore\u2014have\nread all the chapters in proof and recommended additions, omissions,\nand modifications, and have taken part in the personal interrogation of\nimportant witnesses. The lamented death of one member of the Com\nmittee\u2014Dr. A. T. Myers\u2014deprived us of his aid before the final Report\nwas composed ; but he had been able to consider the statistical\nevidence obtained by us as to the influence of ill-health in\"causing\nhallucinations, and to give advice as to the manner in which it^should\nbe treated.\n*\u00bb* A complete Table of Contents will be found at the end ot the Report, before\nthe Appendix.\ni\n\fMethod of Conducting the Enquiry. 33\nChapter TI.\nMETHOD OF CONDUCTING THE ENQUIRY AND GENERAL RESULTS.\nAs has been already explained, our general aim was to ascertain\nwhat proportion of persons have had sensory hallucinations while\nawake, and not suffering from delirium or insanity or any other morbid\ncondition obviously conducive to hallucination ; and, further, to\nenquire into the nature of these hallucinations and the conditions\nunder which they occur. We determined, however, to limit ourselves\nto hallucinations of sight, of hearing, and of touch, and, in the case of\nhearing, to sounds suggesting the human voice ; because, while we thus\nincluded most of the more interesting and important sensory halluci\nnations, we not only reduced the labour of the investigation, but\navoided certain difficulties in obtaining definite statistical results. For\nthe phantasmal character of supposed hallucinations of the other senses\n\u2014of taste, of the muscular sense, of smell,\u2014and of those representing\nnon-vocal sounds, is more often uncertain than that of the hallucinations\nto which we have confined our attention. If any one sees distinctly a\nhuman figure near him in a well-lighted room, where it is certain that\nthere is nobody but himself,\u2014if he hears a familiar voice speaking to\nhim when its owner is miles away, there can hardly be a doubt that\nthe experience is hallucinatory, in the sense explained in the preceding\nchapter. But if he hears in a house a sound of footsteps which all\nefforts fail to explain, it still remains very doubtful whether the\nimpression was not after all caused by a real sound, of which he has\nmerely failed to discover the origin owing to his incomplete knowledge\nof the acoustical properties of the building and of the possible source\nof the sound. Some persons would, we found, in such a case answer\nour question negatively, and others affirmatively, so that a collection of\ntheir answers would be of little statistical value.\nMethod of Conducting the Enquiry.\nThe question put to all the persons who are included in our\nstatistics was :\u2014\nHave you ever, when believing yourselfto be completely awake, luxd a\nvivid impression of seeing or being touched by a living being or inani\nmate object, or of Itearing a voice ; which impression, so far as you could\ndiscover, tvas not due to any external physical cause ?\nThis question we shall speak of as \" the Census question.\" It was\nprinted at the head of a schedule, marked A, with spaces for twenty-\nfive answers and for the names, occupations, etc., of the persons answer\ning. The A schedules were entrusted to persons who volunteered to\ncollect answers, and the collectors were asked to put the question,\nD\n\f34 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nimpartially and unselectively, to persona over the age of 21. An expla\nnation of the object of the enquiry, and instructions as to the method\nto be followed in collecting answers, were printed on the back of the\nschedule, which is reproduced in Appendix A.\nThe Census question is obviously not free from ambiguities, and, as\nworded, would be likely to bring in some affirmative answers not refer\nring to phenomena which we wished to include in our statistics ; 1\nbut ii was necessary to make it short and to avoid technicalities, and\nit seemed difficult to make it more precise consistently with these\nconditions. We believed, too,\u2014and experience has on the whole justified\nthe belief\u2014that the particulars given by our informants would enable\nus to reduce the returns to uniformity.\nFor those who answered the question of schedule A in the affirmative,\na second schedule, marked B, was provided, containing questions, with\nspaces for answers. The questions on this schedule are also re\nprinted in Appendix A. They were intended to bring out the most\nimportant and essential features of the hallucination, together with\nsuch points as the date of its occurrence, the conditions under which it\nwas experienced,whether any notes had been made at the time, and\nwhether the percipient had had any similar experiences. In order\nthat the percipients should not be deterred by the fear of publicity\nfrom giving information, both A and B schedules had printed clearly\non them the words \" No names or addresses will be published without\nspecial permission.\"\nThe information given about the hallucinations was, of course, not\nnecessarily limited by the questions on the B schedule. Many in\nformants volunteered further details, some preferred to write their\naccounts in a narrative form, and in a very large number of cases we\nelicited further details by correspondence,\u2014either directly with the\npercipient or more often through the collector,\u2014and obtained corrobo\nrative evidence. In a considerable number of cases a member of the\nCommittee has seen the percipient and talked over the particulars of\nhis experience with him.\nThe Collectors.\nThe collectors, who aided us in carrying out the enquiry, were 410\nin number, 223 women and 187 men. More than a quarter of them\nwere friends or acquaintances of members of the Committee, and some of\nthese again induced friends or acquaintances of their own to become\ncollectors. About a third of all the collectors are members of the\nS.P.R., while about another sixth are friends of theirs. Further\n1 Strictly interpreted, for instance, it may be held to include impressions occurring\nduring sleep, if the percipient while asleep, believed himself to be awake; and a\nfew of those who answered understood the phrase in this sense.\n\fn.] Method of Conducting the Enquiry.\nassistance in the enquiry was obtained by a special appeal to psycholo\ngists made by Professor Sidgwick in Mind, and through articles by him\nand other members of the Committee published in various more popular\nperiodicals {Nineteenth Century, New Revieio, Mw~ray's Magazine, the\nReview of Review). Through the kindness of Mr. W. T. Stead, copies\nof the A and B schedules were circulated with one number of the\nReview ofReviews, and 40 collectors, who obtained between them 936\nanswers, were thus added. A more complete analysis showing how the\nservices of the collectors have been obtained, with some particulars of\nthe number of answers collected through the different sources, and the\nstatus and profession of the collectors, will be found in Appendix B.\nIt will be observed that the great majority (about nine-tenths) are\neducated people,\u2014educated, that is, up to the standard of the pro\nfessional classes,\u2014and correspondence with nearly all has given us an\nopportunity of judging of the bona fides and intelligence of collectors\nnot personally known to members of the Committee.\nThe work of all the collectors has been entirely gratuitous, and we\ntake this opportunity of thanking them for the care and energy that\nthey have displayed in carrying out a piece of work which has, we\nfear, often turned out to be much more troublesome than they had\nanticipated,\u2014involving, as it has done, a good deal of correspondence\nwith ourselves, as well as persistent questioning of their informants.\nThe amount of work done by some collectors has been very large\nindeed, as will be seen by reference to the Appendix.\nClasses of Persons Included in the Statistics.\nAs far as intellectual status is concerned, the collectors are fairly\nrepresentative of the persons answering the Census question ; as each\nhas, as a rule, collected among his own friends and acquaintances.\nThere is, however, a somewhat larger proportion of uneducated persons\namong those answering than among the collectors, because a few of\nthe educated collectors\u2014and especially some among the large collectors\n\u2014have worked a good deal among uneducated people, and a good many\ncollectors have asked the servants of their own or their friends' house\nholds. Notwithstanding this, the preponderance of educated persons\namong our informants remains too great for our statistics to afford a good\nbasis for ascertaining the distribution of the phenomena investigated\namong different social grades. But so far as they throw light on the\nquestion, they point to the conclusion that differences of educa\ntion and occupation lead to no material difference in tendency to\nhallucinations.\nNumber of Informants.\nThe collection was carried on for a little over three years, having\nbeen begun in April, 1889, and ended in May, 1892. When the time\nd 2\n\f36 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nannounced for closing it arrived, we had nearly 17,000 answers, and,\nby including belated schedules as they came in, we made up, for con\nvenience, a round number, stopping when we had reached exactly\n17,000.\nProportion of Affirmative Answers.\nOf the 17,000 answers, 2,272 were in the affirmative; but it\nappeared on examination that important deductions had to be made\nfrom this number. In some cases the scope of the question asked had\nnot been fully attended to by our informants, and the experiences\ndescribed (e.g., dreams, or the hearing of mysterious footsteps), clearly\ndid not come within it. Affirmative answers relating to such cases\nmust of course be counted as negative. Their number is 353.\nThere are certain other experiences as to which it is doubtful\nwhether they come within the scope of the Census question or not. We\nfind, as might be expected, that persons who have had such experiences\nsometimes answer \" yes \" and sometimes \" no,\" according to their in\nterpretation of the exact meaning of the question. This may have\nhappened to a much larger extent than we can discover, because when\na person answers \" no \" no further information is generally given. For\nstatistical purposes, therefore, it would have been useless to take count\nof these experiences, and the best plan seemed to be to exclude\nthem, in order to secure uniformity of result. We have for this reason\ncounted affirmative answers as negative when the experiences on\nwhich they were based belonged solely to one or other of the following\ntypes :\u2014\n(1) Hallucinations occurringeither during illnessesof a kind inwhich\ndelirium is known often to occur (e.g., scarlet or typhoid fever), though\nthere is no proof that there was delirium in the particular case ; or\nwhile the percipient was suffering from the effects of temporary injury to\nthe brain (e.g., after a blow on the head). (Number of answers, 18.)\n(2) Dream-images and nightmares, even when persisting into the\nwaking state. (Number of answers, 7.)\n(3) Voices or touches rousing the percipient from sleep, but not\ncontinuing when he wakes. (Number of answers, 21.)\n(4) Visions of objects seen with closed eyes. (Number of answers, 3.)\n(5) Visual experiences of the type called \" illusions hypnagogiques \"\n\u2014objects seen in going to sleep or awaking, in the dark, and with\nout reference to actual space (e.g., \" Faces in the dark \"). (Number of\nanswers, 4.)\n(6) Apparent illumination of the place where the percipient was,\nor of real objects in his field of view. (Number of answers, 11.)\n(7) Sounds as of the human voice other than speech\u2014viz., laughing,\nsighing, coughing, singing, crying, groaning, sobbing, whistling,\n\fII.] Method of Conducting the Enquiry. 37\nscreams or shrieks ; also whispering when no distinct words can be\nheard, but not sounds as of speaking aloud, even though the words are\nnot distinguished. (Number of answers, 24.)\n(8) Tactile impressions not involving a sense of contact with any\ndefinite object, e.g., feelings of pressure through the bedclothes, or of\nthe bedclothes being moved, shaking of the bed in which the percipient\nwas, cold breezes. (Number of answers, 10.)\n(9) Lights seen at some little distance out of doors, and thus\nunder conditions in which it is almost necessarily impossible to exclude\nthe hypothesis of their being real lights (9 answers) ; and\n(10) Objects seen sideways out of the corner of the eye, and never\nbrought within the field of direct vision, when there is consequently a\nspecial probability of illusion (5 answers).\n(11) After excluding these well-defined classes of experiences, there\nremain others about which serious doubt must be felt as to whether\nthey were really waking sensory hallucinations at all. A considerable\nnumber1 of such doubtful experiences are included in our tables,\nbecause in view of the numerical comparison to be made of seemingly\nveridical hallucinations with those which are to be taken as purely\nsubjective (see Chapter XIII.), it is important to be sure of not\nunderstating the number of the subjective cases ; but the Committee\nhave felt justified in cutting out certain cases where, after careful con\nsideration, the reasons for regarding the experience as hallucinatory\nseemed to them altogether inadequate. In each case thus omitted\nthey have endeavoured to give full weight to the percipient's own\nopinion. but this is often very dubious. Forty-seven affirmative answers\nhave been counted as negative under this head\u2014namely, 15 as not\ntruly externalised, and 32 as either mere illusions,2 or cases of mis\ntaken identity.\nExperiences of some of the above types are often interesting, and\nsome of them will be discussed further on, although we have excluded\nthem from the numerical tables.\nThe number of answers transferred from the \" yes \" to the \" no \"\nlist under all the above heads is 522,3 or 26 per cent. of the cases in\nwhich those who have answered \" yes \" have given particulars of their\nexperiences.-1\n1 An outside estimate of this number would, we think, be 10 per cent, see p. 100.\n- The distinction between illusions and hallucinations is explained in Chap. V.\n' For further analysis of these transferred answers, see Appendix C.\n* Quite apart from this changing of the answer from \"yes\" into \"no,\" 21 persons\nwho answered \" yes \" have been excluded altogether from the Census, because the\naccount given of their experiences was such as to make it almost certain that they\nshould have been counted as answering \" no,\" but was too vague for us to feel quite\njustified in counting them so-\n\f38 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nBut 256 persons have given the answer \" yes \" and withheld all\ninformation as to the nature of their experiences. Various causes have\nled to this\u2014sometimes merely negligence, indolence, or shyness on the\npart of collector or percipient\u2014sometimes disinclination in the per\ncipient to confide in the collector\u2014sometimes the vagueness or remote\nness of the experience, making it difficult for the percipient to describe\nor remember details, or its triviality, making him think it not worth\nrecording,\u2014sometimes the intimate nature of the experience and the\nemotions connected with it. All these causes, we know, have operated,\nand there may have been others. We have as far as possible tried\nto overcome these difficulties by corresponding ourselves with the\npercipients who had given no particulars, and have in 39 cases obtained\ninformation from them. From the accounts received, together with\ninformation given in some other cases by collectors, we have come to\nthe conclusion that the general character of the experiences which are\nnot described, is not, on the whole, different from that of the described\nexperiences. We have accordingly felt justified in assuming that the\nproportion of affirmative answers which should have been negative\nis about the same among the undescribed cases as among those which\nare described, and therefore 26 per cent. of those who have answered\n\" yes \" and given no particulars, have been transferred to the \" no \"\ncolumn. 1\nWith these corrections, our answers are found to be divided as\nshown in Table I. The number of experiences which led to the affirma\ntive answers are shown in Tables II. (with Supplement), IV., V., VI.,\nVII. and VIII., classified under different heads, according to the\nsense affected, the nature of the percept, the date of the occurrence,\nand certain conditions of the percipient at the time. Table III. is a\nkind of Supplement to Table I., relating to the answers of informants\nwho have had more than one experience. Table IX. gives the results\nof Tables I. and II., divided according to the nationality of the infor\nmants ; Table X. the results obtained in certain specially selected\nportions of the collection ; and Table XI. the present ages of our\ninformants, and the distribution of the hallucinations according to the\nage of the percipient at the time of the experience.\nThe Tables are followed by further explanations.\n1 Of the 522 answers transferred from the \" yes \" to the \" no \" list on account of\nexperiences not coming within the scope of the Census question, 198 were from men\nand 324 from*women; Thus, of the whole number of persons who hare answered\n\"yes\" and given particulars of their experiences, 25J per cent. of the men\nand 26 per cent. of the women should have answered \"no.\" Of the 256 persons\nanswering \" yes \" and giving no particulars of their experiences, 102 were men\nand 154 women. Of these, therefore, 251 per cent.

They are either shadowy, vague, transparent, or\ncolourless ; or they represent part only of the human form, the rest being\nconspicuously absent (not merely apparently hidden by intervening objects).\nAll appearances of a hand, or hand and arm only, 14 in number, are also\n\fII.] 51\nExplanation of Tables.\nplaced in this column, as are veiled and shrouded apparitions even when\nquite solid looking. Examples of this class are discussed in connection\nwith the development of hallucinations in Chapter VI. By \" Visions,\" which\noccupy column (5), we mean scenes or pictures or sometimes single figures or\nfaces, which do not seem to belong to the percipient's actual surroundings.\nFor a discussion of this class, see Chapter IV. In columns (6) and (7) are\napparitions of persons or things which we should not expect to meet with in\nthe real world ; for examples, see Chapters VI. and VIII. In column (11) we\nhave placed hallucinatory objects which our percipients did not see distinctly\nenough to identify as anything in particular, or could not give a name to.\nWith these we have included appearances as of smoke and two cases of dark\nshadows between the percipient and the lamp or candle.\nThese definitions, of course, apply also to the other Tables relating to\nvisual hallucinations.\nMode of Counting the Hallucinations.\nThe total numbers of Table II. do not, of course, correspond with those of\nTable I., because, while Table I. gives the number of persons answering\n\"yes,\" Table II. gives the number of specified haUncinntions, and a large\nnumber of our informants (see Table III.) have had more than one hallucina\ntion, the number they have had varying from two to an indefinitely large\nnumber. The degree of minuteness with which these are either described or\nenumerated varies very much, and some difficulty has thus been introduced\ninto the tabulation of hallucinations. The plan we have finally adopted is\nas follows :\u2014\nEvery experience individually mentioned, described, or enumerated has\nbeen counted in Table II. in. its appropriate line and column.1 When a\ngeneral description is given of a type of hallucination which has been ex\nperienced more than once, but the number W occasions on which it occurred\nis not stated definitely, the description is taken for the purposes of Table II.\nas applying to one individual experience. The case is also put down under\nits own head in the Supplement to Table II., the object of which is to give\nsuch data as there are for a correction of Table II. on account of those\nhallucinations which are mentioned only in a general manner in groups, and\nnot enumerated. We have-divided these\" groups into groups of \" several \"\nand of \" many.\" Our informants do not, of course, always use the words\n\" several \" or \" many\" in their account, but we think that the words they use\nmay fairly be classed under these two heads. Thus, expressions like \"on\nother occasions,\" \" a few times,\" '' two or three times,\" \" more than once \"\n(or any indefinite number apparently not exceeding 10), are taken as\nequivalent to \" several times \" ; and \"often,\" \" frequently,\" or any indefinite\nnumber apparently exceeding 10 (e.g., \"almost nightly for about three\nmonths \"), are taken as equivalent to \" many times.\"\nSome examples will make the mode of counting clearer.\nNo. 422.22, whose narrative is printed in Chapter XVII. , saw apparitions\nof a deceased person known to him. He describes four separate occasions,\n1 Hallucinations said to have affected two or more percipients at the same time are\ncounted once for each percipient included in the Census.\nE 2\n\f52 [chap.\nReport on the Census of Hallucinations.\nbut says that there were many others. The collector further informs us that\nhe has had other hallucinations. His experiences appear, therefore, in Table\nII. as 4 cases of apparitions of a dead person, and in the Supplement to Table\nII. as (a) one case of \"many \" apparitions of a dead person, and (6) one case\nat second-hand 1 of \" several \" hallucinations insufficiently described for\nclassification.\nNo. 484.22 frequently saw an apparition of his father (then living)\nstanding by his study door, with his face looking livid and a dark bruise\non his left temple. This is counted in Table II. as one case of an appari\ntion of a living person, and in the Supplement to Table II. as one case of\n\"many\" such.\nNo. 698.23 (see Chapter XVI.) saw many times an apparition of an old\nman with bright blue eyes, dressed in a black coat and white riding breeches,\nand also saw many times an apparition of a certain deceased person. This\ncase is counted in Table II. as (o) one unrecognised human apparition and\n(6) one apparition of a dead person, and in the Supplement to Table II. as\none case of \"many \" under each of these two heads.\nNo. 55.1 often heard his name called\u2014generally in his mother's voice\u2014\nboth before and after her death, sometimes in the voice of other friends.\nThis appears in Table II. as (a) one auditory hallucination of the voice of a\nliving person and (6) one auditory hallucination of the voice of a dead\nperson, and in the Supplement to Table II. as one case of \" many \" auditory\nhallucinations under each of these two heads.\nThe cases of \"several \" or \" many \" hallucinations in the Supplement to\nTable II. do not include hallucinations repeated once or more at such short\nintervals\u2014one or two days at most\u2014as to suggest that the appearances after\nthe first are merely recrudescences of the first. These cases, of which there\nare about 20, are included only in Table II.. and there counted each as one\ncase, unless there are some special features of difference between the\ndifferent appearances. Thus No. 340. 19, in which the percipient saw a\nfigure in a grey cloak at the end of a lighted passage, and saw it again in the\npassage half an hour later, is counted as one case. In a few of the cases, the\nsame figure appears many times at short intervals during the course of one\nor two days. Instances of this, quoted below, are Mr. Beer's experience,\nNo. 645.11, in Chapter XII., and Miss M.'s experience, No. 740.9, in\nChapter XVII.\nThe mode of counting hallucinations adopted in Table II. is also used in\nall the tables that follow ; but in Tables IV., V.. VI., VII., and VIII. second\nhand cases are not included, nor the experiences included in column (12) of\nTable II. as \" insufficiently described for classification.\"\nIn the Supplement to Table II., and in Tables III., X., and XI., the\nterm \" visual hallucinations \" includes all the cases where some other sense\nthan sight was affected at the same time ; the term \" auditory hallucination \"\nincludes only cases where the sense of hearing alone, or of hearing and touch\n1 Column (12l in Table II. includes only single cases of hallucinations insufficiently\ndescribed to be classified. When it appears that a percipient has had an indefinite\nnumber of experiences thus insufficiently described, they are included only in the\nSupplement to Table II.\n\fp.] Explanation of Tables. 53\ntogether, were affected ; and the term \"tactile hallucination\" includes only\ncases where the sense of touch alone was affected. The total numbers\ngiven under these heads are, therefore, to be compared with the total\nnumbers in columns (14), (15) and (16) of Table 11.\nOn the other hand, in the Tables relating to hallucinations of each sense\nby itself, viz., Tables IV..V., VI.,VII., and VIII., the term \" visual hallucina\ntion \" is used in the same way as just explained, but the auditory Table\nalso includes cases where some other sense than that of hearing, and the\ntactile Table cases where some other sense than that of touch , was affected\nat the same time, so that the \" bisensory \" and \" trisensory \" hallucinations\nare counted for each sense affected in these Tables, which consequently\noverlap to some extent.\nExplanation of the Estimates in Table XI.\nThe periods we have taken (except the last) are each ten years long ;\nthus the heading \" 10 to 19 \" means 10 years old and upwards, but under 20,\nand so on. As the Census question was only to be put to persons over 21,\nthe period headed \"20 to 29,\" as far as the ages of informants are\nconcerned, is really a period of nine years, from 21 years of age upwards.\nThe last line but one of Table XI. is arrived at by assuming that the\n6,521 informants (1,447 of those who answered \"yes,\" and 5,074 of those\nwho answered \"no\") whose age at the time they answered the Census\nquestion was stated, either by themselves or by the collector, are fairly\nrepresentative of the 17,000 persons included m the Census, and therefore\nthat the number of informants of each age multiplied by 8J gives the\nnumber of that age for the whole Census. The numbers so multiplied are\nwhat we give in the line in question.\nThe average present age of the 6,521 informants was 40 years, which we\nmay assume to be the average present age of all the persons included in the\nCensus.\nThe last line of the Table is arrived at by distributing the 769 hallucina\ntions which occurred at unstated ages proportionately among the different\nage periods and dividing the totals thus obtained by the estimated number\nof persons who have had a chance of experiencing a hallucination within\nthat period. The number of possible percipients for any particular period\nis estimated by taking the arithmetic mean between the number of persons\nwhose age exceeds the highest age included in the period and the number of\nthose who have not yet attained the lowest age included in it.\n\f54 [chap.\nReport on the Census of Hallucinations.\nChapter III.\nDISCUSSION OF THE TRUSTWORTHINESS OF OUR RESULTS.\nWe have now to consider how far the proportions of the affirmative\nanswers in Table I. and of the different kinds of hallucinations in the\nother tables represent fairly the true proportions in the circles from\nwhich our information is drawn.\nSeveral possible sources of error need discussion.\nPossibility of Deception.\n(1) There is first the possibility that some of the affirmative answers\nreceived have been intentionally deceptive, and some of the accounts\nof hallucinations fictitious.\nThis may have occurred occasionally, but it has not, we feel sure,\noccurred to any appreciable extent. The method of collecting was\ncalculated to guard against it, both by providing that the question\nshould only be put to persons of mature age, (over 21),\u2014who are\ncertainly less likely to romance, on the whole, than children,\u2014and also\nthat it should be asked through collectors. The answers on Schedule\nA were attested by the name and generally by the signature of the\ninformant, and always by that of the collector ; and the collectors\nbeing, as a rule, if not friends, at least acquaintances of the persons\nasked, would have some means of judging whether they could be relied\non, while there would also be less likelihood of informants giving an\nuntrue answer when it would involve deceiving a friend or acquaint\nance, and not merely a stranger.\nIf, notwithstanding this, there were deception, the following up of\nthe details of the hallucinations would be pretty sure to reveal it.\nApart from the improbability of deception thus secured, and the\nabsence of any motive for it, we think that the general style and\ncharacter of the accounts received are clearly indicative of genuineness.\nThe cases quoted in the course of our report will give the reader an\nopportunity of forming an opinion on this point for himself.\n(2) We have been so far discussing the question whether \" yes \" has\nbeen untruthfully said for \" no,\" but it is also possible that \"no\" has been\nuntruthfully and deliberately said instead of \" yes.\" We know of eight\ncases in which the collector, rightly or wrongly, concluded, from infor\nmation received, that this had happened.1 If these persons ought to\nhave answered \" yes,\" they presumably answered \" no \" because they\n} Two of these eight answers were cut out by the collector. The other six remain\nin our tables as negative answers, since we do not know enough of the details to justify\nus in changing them.\n\fRefusals to Answer. 55\nresented being asked, or wished to avoid further questioning,\u2014perhaps\nowing to the presence of others. Of course we cannot assume that we\nhave heard of all the cases where \" no \" has been given instead of\n\" yes,\" especially as the collector would not always suspect it ; but it\nis unlikely that there are many, since it was obviously open to anyone\neither to refuse to give an answer, or to answer \" yes,\" and refuse to\ngive details.\nRefusals to Answer the Census Question.\n(3) The next possibility is that those who have refused to answer\neither \"yes\" or \"no\" to the Census question may include a materially\nlarger or smaller proportion of those who should have said \" yes \"\nthan the proportion of affirmative answers in our Tables.\nWe have received information from a good many collectors as to the\nrefusals they have met with, the results which they thought were pro\nduced on their own collections by them, and the motives which they\nthought influenced the refusals. Two or three persons have been dis\ncouraged from collecting altogether on account of refusals to answer,\nand it is very probable that many other refusals have not been reported\nto us at all ; but we think that those reported are most likely fairly\nrepresentative. In about 51 cases (reported by 19 collectors) the col\nlector knew, or had reason to think, that the person who refused should\nhave answered \" yes \" ; and in a few of these we know further that the\nrefusal arose from the intimate or painful nature of the experience. In\n9 cases (reported by 4 collectors) it was believed that the answer should\nhave been \"no.\" In about 16 cases (reported by 8 collectors),\nthe collector had no grounds for any opinion as to what the answer\nshould have been.\nWe have also received some general statements from other\ncollectors with regard to refusals to answer. As regards affirmative\nanswers,one collector finds great difficultyin persuading people who have\nhad experiences to answer \" yes,\" \" as they seem to have a great\nhorror of being questioned on the subject, or of having their names\npublished.\" Another says, \" Many refused on the ground that they\nhad seen or heard something.\" Another \"is convinced that those who\ncould answer ' yes ' frequently refuse to answer at all.\" On the other\nhand, the following opinions of collectors seem to indicate the with\nholding of negative answers. Onesays\"Manyobjectedfortrivialreasons.\"\nAnother \" found it difficult to induce people to interest themselves in the\nsubject sufficiently to give their signatures.\" A third concluded, from re\nmarks he overheard about another collector, that \"a great many persons\nwhose answer would be ' no ' refuse to sign from mere contempt for the\nwhole subject, whereas those who have had any experience of the kind,\nhowever slight, are impressed with the seriousness of the enquiry, and\n\f5G Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nmore ready to take the trouble to enter their names.\" A fourth says\n\"Most of my acquaintance object to even writing 'no.'\" A fifth\nfinds \" some people strangely reluctant to sign anything.\" Another\nwrites : \" Several people have declined to answer, for they said they\ncould not feel sure whether they had seen something or not.\" Another\nfound that \" there were two classes of people who ridiculed the idea ;\nnamely, those who read little or nothing outside newspapers .\nand also Spiritualists, who seemed to take it as a deliberate insult.\"1\nThe Committee have themselves met with 9 persons who refused\nto answer, out of 594 asked. In two of these cases the collector felt no\ndoubt that the answer should have been \"yes,\" and they have accor\ndingly been counted as undescribed affirmative answers. In four cases\nthe collector was doubtful what the answer should be, and in the\nremaining three it was nearly certain that it should have been \"no.\"\nIt may be instructive to examine the last seven in more detail. Of one\nnothing is known, but the collector gathered from the manner of the\nperson asked that he had had some psychical experience, though it may\nnot have been a hallucination. One person asked to take the paper\naway with him, promising to think it over and send in his answer\nlater ; this never came, in spite of reminders, and the collector thought\nthat the evasion probably arose from an unwillingness to give details.\nAnother similarly evaded a direct reply, apparently from a general\naversion to the subject. A fourth was not sure whether what she had\nseen\u2014two vague white figures in a garden at night\u2014was an apparition\nor real persons. Of the three persons who, the collector thought, should\nhave answered \" no,\" one referred to a childish experience which he is\nnow sure was not hallucinatory, though he thought differently at the\ntime, and the other two thought that all the enquiries of the S.P.R.\ntended to foster superstition, and therefore would have nothing to do\nwith any of them.\nBesides the reasons for refusals to answer already mentioned, the\nidea that sensory hallucinations are symptoms of insanity and a con\nsequent shrinking from mentioning them have probably operated to\nsome slight extent. This has been mentioned to us as one of the\nobstacles met with by two persons in collecting. Neither of these,\nhowever, sent in any returns.\nIt will be seen that it is very difficult or impossible to make a\nnumerical estimate of the total error that has been introduced into\n1 This is the only instance reported to us of a collector who has found any dif\nficulty in workiog among Spiritualists, though several persons expressed io us before\nhand their fe\u00bbr that Spiritualists and others who believed their experiences to be\nveridical would be repelled by the terms used in our schedules\u2014especially the use of\nthe word \" hallucination.\" As a matter of fact, many Spiritualists have been included\nin the Census, and several\u2014notably Mr. Akaakoff\u2014have assisted us as collectors-\n\fDanger of Selection. :i1\nour statistics by refusals to answer. But the small proportion of\nrefusals experienced by the Committee, together with the conflicting\nreasons for refusals reported by other collectors, lead us to believe\nthat this error is not very important. So far as it goes, it\nprobably tends to reduce unduly, but only to a small extent, the pro\nportion of affirmative answers, and especially those relating to ex\nperiences which affect the percipient emotionally, such as phantasms of\ndead and dying persons closely connected with him, and religious\nphantasms.\nDanger of Selection.\n(4) Another cause of error requiring careful consideration lies in\nthe possibility that the collector may have selected the persons to be\nasked according to what they were likely to say, either through his\ngreater interest in obtaining one form of answer rather than another,\nor on some other ground. We adopted two precautions with a view to\navoiding this particular source of error. First, we printed instructions\nto collectors on this point (see Appendix A). Secondly, we did not\nreceive isolated answers, but asked for 25.1 To collect 25 answers is\na sufficiently difficult task to make collectors unwilling, as a\nrule, to neglect opportunities of obtaining any of either sort. We\nbelieve that most of our collectors have understood the importance of\navoiding any kind of selection, and in many cases we have definite\nevidence, through our correspondence with them, that this is so. Still,\nwe have evidence of some selection. In fact, 13 collectors\u2014out of\n410\u2014have used expressions which have made us think that they, or\nfriends collecting for them, had allowed themselves to be biassed by\na desire to obtain affirmative answers, as being more interesting.\nBetween them, they collected 398 answers, of which 1 4 per cent. were\naffirmative ; so that, as the average proportion is 9'9 per cent., they\nwould seem to have had some success in this illegitimate endeavour,\nthough not enough to affect materially the total result.\nOn the other hand, some affirmative answers which wuuld naturally\nhave come in have been omitted. Thus, four collectors whom we know\nto have had hallucinatory experiences, or experiences which at one time\nthey believed to be so, have omitted to put down their own answers in\ntheir lists, and in one case, a collector, who thought his proportion of\naffirmative answers was getting too large, abstained from asking some\npersons who, he thought, would answer \" yes.\"\nOn the whole, we should conclude from our communications with\ncollectors, and our examination of their returns that, while pursuit of\naffirmative answers has certainly taken place to some extent, its\n1 A few of our collectors have not sent in the full 25, but have probably at least\nmade an effort to do so.\n\f58 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\noperation has been too limited to cause any considerable increase in.\nthe general proportion of affirmative to negative answers. But to\nobtain greater certainty on this point, we adopted two methods of\nchecking the general result.\n(a) With aview to judging whether selection were exercised,we asked\ncollectors, in our instructions, to mark the names of persons in their\nlists whose answers they could have foretold. Unfortunately, all our\ncollectors have not attended to this instruction, and the check thus\nafforded would have been in any case only partial, because previous\nknowledge of an answer would, of course, be no proof that it was\nselected ; the person giving it might be one whom the collector would\nnaturally ask in any case.1\n(b) A more efficient means of judging of the combined effects of selec\ntion and refusals to answer was obtained by means of answers from\ncomplete groups of persons, the groups being denned in some way quite\nunconnected with the investigation. Thus all the members of a house\nhold, including servants, would form such a group, or all the members\nof a committee (not formed for purposes of psychical research), or all\nthe persons present at a dinner party, or all the persons who happened\nto be together in a room at a given time. Groups of this kind will\nobviously be entirely unselected in respect of experience of hallucina\ntions, and they also cannot be affected by refusals to answer, since such\na refusal from any one person would simply exclude the whole group as\nincomplete. A comparison of the answers obtained from these groups\nwith the whole number of answers gives, therefore, a means of judging\nhow far the proportion of affirmative to negative answers has been\naffected on the whole by these two sources of error. The answe'rs of\npersons included in these groups, classified as in Tables I. and II., but\nwith less detail, are shown in Division A of Table X. above.\nThey are not so numerous as we could have wished, but this mode\nof collecting is rather troublesome, and not very easy to explain to\ncollectors by correspondence, and the Committee have had to rely on\nthemselves for a large part of this division.\nIn Table X. we also show (in Division B) all the answers collected\nby members of the Committee and (in Division C) the answers collected\nby persons who have had systematic training in medicine or psychology,\nwhose collections have been kept distinct in accordance with a desire\nstrongly expressed at the Paris International Congress of Experimental\nPsychology. It was in order to make this portion of the collection as large\nas possible, that Professor Sidgwick made his special appeal for the\nco-operation of psychologists in Mind, of October, 1889. Speaking\n1 Nor would comparison of the number of marked \" yeses \" and marked \" noes \" help\nus, since a collector could hardly ever be sure that any answer would be negative.\n\fIII.] 59\nDanger of Selection.\nbroadly, -we may presume that these specially trained collectors were\nspecially on their guard against any tendency to selection.\nDivision B of Table X., collected by the Committee, is perhaps of\nless interest to others than to ourselves ; but we are, of course, in a\nposition to make more positive statements about these answers than\nabout other parts of the collection. We are certain, as regards this\nset of answers, that they are unselected, either as to the kind of\nanswers, or the kind of hallucinations, included. We believe also that\nerrors due to hasty and insufficiently considered answers, and to neglect\nof trivial cases, occur less among the answers collected by the Com\nmittee than in the average of the whole collection.\nIn using the results of these special sets of answers to control\nthe results of our general collection, comparison ought to be made\nwith that part of the general collection\u2014nearly 16,000\u2014which was\nobtained from English-speaking persons (see Table IX.), since it was\nfrom these that all the answers in Table X., except 3 per cent. of\nDivision C, were obtained.\nOn making this comparison, it will be seen that the percentages of\naffirmative answers in Table X. are throughout above the average.\nIt may therefore be inferred that the operation of selection in\nincreasing affirmative answers in the general collection must have been\nmore than counterbalanced by some other cause. A comparison in\nmore detail between the special sets of answers and the general\ncollection shows that the percentage of visual experiences, though on\nthe whole hugher in the special sets of answers, cannot be said to differ\nin any very marked degree from the general average, and in the set\ncollected by the Committee is almost identical with it ; so that the\ntrustworthiness as regards the number of visual experiences of the\ncollection in general receives decided confirmation from the special sets\nof answers. On the other hand, the proportion of auditory and\ntactile experiences is, in the special sets A and B, double that in the\nwhole collection. This we believe, however, to be mainly due to\nanother source of error which will be considered below : viz., that\nauditory and tactile experiences are apt to be trivial and unimpres\nsive, and thus easily forgotten or ignored, unless special care is taken\nin enquiring about them.\nProportion of Collectors wlw have had Hallucinations.\n(5) Before leaving the subject of selection, it may be well to\ndiscuss another form of it. It has been suggested that persons who\nhave had experiences of their own, or whose intimate friends have had\nthem, would thereby be led to take an interest in the subject, and con\nsequently to serve as collectors; and that this natural selection of collec\ntors would lead to our collection being made in circles in which there is a\n\f60 Report on the Census of HaUucinations. [chap.\ngreater tendency to hallucinations than among the average of man\nkind. This predicted selection of collectors has perhaps operated to a\ncertain extent, for of the 326 collectors1 whose answers are included\nin the Census, either in their own lists or in those of other collectors,\n68, or about 21 per cent., answered \" yes.\" Moreover, it is probably\ntrue that a tendency to hallucinations sometimes runs in families,2 and\nalso that a habit of attaching importance to them either fosters\na tendency to them, or brings persons who have the tendency together.\nA collector who himself answered \" yes \" might therefore possibly be\napt to obtain more affirmative answers than one who himself answered\n\" no.\" But the whole effect thus produced can only have been small,\nand for evidence tending to show that it is practically unimportant we\nmay refer again to Table X.,\u2014since only one member of the Com\nmittee can answer the Census question in the affirmative, and that one\nonly on account of a trivial and uninteresting tactile experience ; nor\nhas the interest of its members in the subject been fostered by the ex\nperiences of their relatives and friends, so that division B is free from\nsuspicion of the source of error here discussed.\n(6) So far we have considered sources of error in our statistics which,\nthough feared or suspected, appear either to have had no material\neffect, or to have counteracted each other. The case is very different\nas regards that now to be considered\u2014namely, forgetfulness. This may\nbe of two kinds.\nSuperficial Forgetfulness.\nThere is first the temporary forgetfulness which comes from\nmere carelessness or want of sufficient thought, with which may\nbe classed a neglect to answer affirmatively arising from the view-\nthat certain experiences were too trivial to be worth mentioning.\nIt may be instructive to quote some of the opinions expressed by\ncollectors as to the effect of this kind of forgetfulness on the\nstatistics. One says \" it is rather common for a person to answer ' no '\nat once ; while if you go on speaking to them a little, they will say\n' I once had a queer sort of experience, but it is not worth relating.'\nThen if you press them, you may find it is just the sort of thing which\nyou are asking about.\" Another remarked that most people hesitated\nbefore they could say \"no,\" only those who were apparently not\ninclined to very deep thought gave a decided negative. A third says\n\" one difficulty is that many entirely forget anything of the kind and it\nis only by an effort and often after some time that they can recall them.\"\n1 Theremaining S4 collectors gave no answer, or at least we have failed to trace\ntheir answers among the 17.000.\n2 For evidence on this question afforded by the present collection, Bee\nChapter VIII.\n\fIII.] 61\nForget\/iilness.\nTwo others find that people often say \" no \" at first and then change to\n\"yes\" when they ;*o on talking and explaining to them what is wanted.\nTwo others think that trivial experiences,such as hearing voices, are very\ncommon and perhaps not always included. Another, who has collected\naccounts of supernormal occurrences for many years, is persuaded that\nthe answer should often be \" yes \" when it is put down as \"no \"\u2014much\noftener than the reverse.\nThe following is a description of his methods and conclusions given\nby another collector, who has had special opportunities of making the\nenquiry in an important Government office :\u2014\n\" I have had 225 answers in all from two different offices, 125 from one,\nand 100 from the other. In each case I went round the office asking every\nbody of the required age, without selection, until I had completed the\nrequired number. . . . Out of the 125, I have 17 ' yeses,' one doubtful.\n'' In the other office, out of 100,1 have only eight ' yeses,' and of these one\nis a 'non-Census' 'yes,' and two others seem doubtful cases. I am\nunable to account satisfactorily for the smaller proportion here. The\nmen belong almost entirely to what is called the Second Division of the\nCivil Service\u2014i.e., they entered by a very simple competitive examination,\nand are mostly below the standard of University education.\n\" I am not so well known in the office as in my own\u2014not known even by\nsight to many of the men\u2014and it is possible that these men may have been\nless careful to answer the question of a stranger. Again, I think it possible\nthat fear of ridicule may have withheld some from answering ' yes.' Neither\ncause would be likely to lose us any very striking hallucinations ; but both, I\nthink, may have operated to exclude some auditory and tactile cases. I am\nconvinced, from the result of the enquiry, that to answer the question fully\nrequires a pretty careful and prolonged interrogation of memory : a task\nwhich my questionees were in most cases probably unwilling to undertake.\nSome asked to keep the paper, and sent in their reply a day after. But\nthis source of error (which would only exclude unimportant ' yeses ') has\nprobably affected my answers less than those of other collectors. The ques\ntion was in all cases asked personally, and an interval of about five minutes\nleft for reply. (My plan was to come into a room, distribute a Census paper\nto each of four or five persons, and then go round and talk and answer ques\ntions until one or other was ready with his answer.) In very few cases did a\nman reply ' no ' at once.\n\"Still, I feel almost sure that if I could have discussed the matter for\n20 minutes with each individual, I should have had a larger proportion of\n' yeses.' For instance, wrote ' no ' first, and some ten minutes later,\nin a discussion on the general subject, mentioned his experiences, ' which, of\ncourse,were only the result of dyspepsia,and not worth putting down. ' I think,\ntherefore, that though the present collection may perhaps be more accurate\nthan that of the average collector\u2014not onfy from absence of selection, but\nfrom the exceptional facilities which I had for securing the attention of\nmy questionees (the subject being regarded as a welcome relief to the\nmonotony of office work, and the men having no other occupation, beyond\n\f62 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nthe work aforesaid, to distract them)\u2014it is still by no means complete as\nregards the less impressive experiences.\"\nIt will be noticedthat almost all thecollectors quoted believe that it is\nthe trivial experiences\u2014auditory and tactile ones generally\u2014which\nhave been ignored. That these should be the ones ignored, one would\nnaturally expect, since trivial experiences,\u2014e.g., hearing one's name\ncalled from a distance when no one is calling,\u2014often make little\nimpression, because, from their nature, they are apt to leave the per\ncipient himself in doubt as to whether they are really hallucinatory, or\nonly misinterpretations of real sounds.\nThe correctness of the view that trivial auditory and tactile expe\nriences have been a good deal ignored is confirmed, we think, by\nTable X. The Committee have been careful as far as possible to pre\nvent the ignoring of these experiences in their own collection, and it\nis probably owing to this that they have obtained so high a percentage\ncompared with the average. If we may judge from Table X., it would\nappear that, roughly speaking, the inclusion of unimpressive auditory\nand tactile experiences which have been neglected in the whole col\nlection, would have about doubled the number of auditory and tactile\nexperiences recorded : while the same comparison would show that no\nmaterial loss of this kind has occurred in visual experiences.\nPermanent Forgetfulness.\nBut there is a more serious and complete oblivion which no care or\nthought will overcome\u2014the forgetfulness which in course of time effaces\nsome experiences from the mind altogether\u2014at least so far as conscious\nmemory is concerned. This kind of forgetfulness will affect the work\nof all collectors, and the answers of all groups of informants, alike, and\ncannot be checked by the special collections shown in Table X. We\nmust, therefore, adopt some other method for estimating the extent of\nits operation.\nIn considering this question we will confine our attention, in the\nfirst instance, to visual hallucinations ; the record of which, as we\nhave just seen, is not materially affected by any of the sources of\nerror so far considered ; while, as will hereafter appear, they are of\nspecial importance in estimating the evidence for telepathy.\nIn order to judge of the effect of lapse of time on the number of visual\nhallucinations reported to us, and to discover, as far as is possible from\nthe reported number, what the true number should be, we have in\nTable IV. divided the reported number according to the length of\nyears that had in each case elapsed since the occurrence, when the\npercipient answered the Census question.\nAs all our informants are over 20 years of age, they have all had\nmore than 10 years in which to experience hallucinations. If there\n\fm] G3\nForgetfulness.\nfore they were sufficiently numerous for accidental variations to be\neliminated, and if hallucinations occurred with equal frequency at all\nages, the same number would have occurred to our informants during\neach of the last 10 years. But an inspection of Table IV. at once shows\nthat this is not the case with those reported. On the contrary, they ex\nhibit a more or less systematic variation ; the number for the most recent\nyear being comparatively very large, the annual number decreasing\nrapidly at first as the years become more remote, and, when we reach\n8, 9 and 10 years ago, being less than half what it is at first. This\nvariation is far too systematic to be accounted for by accident, and any\nerror in our assumption that hallucinations are equally numerous at all\nages will affect the number occurring annually but little, if at all, being\nneutralised by the variety in the ages of our informants. It is clear,\ntherefore, that as the years recede into the distance the proportion of\nthe hallucinations that occurred in them to those which are forgotten,\nor at least ignored, is very large.\nIf we could assume that the number reported for the most recent\nyear was correct\u2014that memory has been trustworthy for a year\u2014we\ncould infer the total number from it by multiplying it by the mean\nnumber of years during which our informants have lived. But when\nwe analyse the experiences reported for the last year, we find the\ndifference between the recent and remote portions of it even more\nmarked than that between the last year and 10 years ago. Out of\nthe 87 visual hallucinations reported for the last year, 42 are\nstated to have occurred within the most recent quarter, and of these\n19 within the most recent month, and 12 within the most recent\nhalf-month ; numbers which correspond approximately to 168,\n228, and 288 per annum instead of 87. This kind of difference\nextends through all classes of visual hallucinations (though it is less in\ndegree in some than in others), and this confirms the view that it\ncannot be accidental. At the same time we have now come to sub\ndivisions too small for us to rely on the exact numbers, not only\nbecause the numbers are too small for accidental variations to be\neliminated, but because any error in them is very largely multiplied\nin the final result.1 If, therefore, we are to infer the whole number\nof hallucinations from the number within a given recent period, it is\na matter of some difficulty to determine what the length of the recent\n1 Suppose, for instance, that we wish to infer from the number within the\nmost recent half-month how many occurred altogether. Then, since the average\nage of our informants is 40 years (see p. 53) we must multiply 12 \u2014 the\nnumber within the half-month\u2014by 24 times 40, which makes 11,520. But if\nthere has been a mistake, and one of those said to have occurred within the\nhalf-month occurred 16 days ago, then the whole number would be reduced\nby A or 960.\n\f64 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nperiod should be : since, if it is too long, the numbers are reduced by\nforgetfulness ; while if it is too short, we are liable to largely magni\nfied errors in the result.\nIn deciding on the period, we have been influenced by another\nconsideration\u2014viz., that oblivion appears to have specially affected\ndoubtful hallucinations, or alleged hallucinations erroneously regarded\nas such.\nWe are led to this view by examining the 42 cases in the most\nrecent quarter individually, and observing how many exhibit certain\nspecified and easily defined characteristics suggestive of possible mistake\nas to their hallucinatory nature.\nWe find that (a) in 7 cases, 4 of them in the most recent half-\nmonth, the figure was seen at some distance, either out of doors, or in\na public room\u2014circumstances which make a mistake of identity not\nimprobable.1\nAgain (b) in 2 cases, both within the most recent half-month, the\nfigure was seen passing outside the door of the room in which the\npercipient was, or was seen inside the room as the percipient passed\nthe door\u2014circumstances which allow of only a momentary view, and\nsuggest illusion as an explanation.\nThirdly (c) in 3 cases, of which one occurred within the most\nrecent half-month, the light was bad and the circumstances not such as\non other grounds to exclude the possibility of mistakes.\nThus altogether 12 cases out of the 42 must on the specified grounds\nbe regarded as doubtfully hallucinatory. We will call these \" the\nsuspicious cases.\" If we omit them, we get 30 as the number in the\nmost recent quarter, 12 in the most recent month, and 5 in the most\nrecent half-month ; numbers which correspond to 120, 144, and 120\nper annum respectively. From the approximate agreement of these\nnumbers we infer that, apart from the suspicious cases, there was no\nmaterial forgetfulness within three months ; and we think that this\nperiod is not too short to be used as a basis for an approximate\nestimate of the whole number of hallucinations that actually occur.\nTo be on the safe side, let us take 140 as the number of visual\nhallucinations that occur annually, omitting the suspicious cases.\n1 In one of the 7 cases, the figure was unrecognised, and the proof of its\nbeing hallucinatory was merely its unexplained disappearance while the per\ncipient was looking away. A similar mysterious disappearance either behind an\nobstacle, or while the percipient was not looking, occurred in 3 out of the 6\nrecognised cases, but the evidence in such cases that a real person could not thus\nhave been lost sight of can seldom be made strong. It is worth noting that in\nat least 4 of the fi recognised cases the percipient was expecting the person he\nbelieved he saw, which would tend to make him accept too uncritically the impression\nthat he saw him.\n\fIII.] 65\nForgetfulness.\nIn estimating the whole number, it is convenient to limit our\nselves to those which occurred since the age of 10 years, be\ncause memory is undoubtedly comparatively untrustworthy at very\nearly ages, and hallucinations must be assumed to share the oblivion\nwhich overtakes most of the events of our earliest years ; moreover,\nthe power of distinguishing hallucinations from real objects is probably\nundeveloped in small children. Now our informants have on an average\nlived for 30 years since they were 10 years old, so that the number of\nvisual hallucinations they will have experienced since that age, at the\nrate of 140 per annum, is 4,200. But the whole number they have\nreported is 1,112, and of these we infer from Table XI. that a little\nover 8 per cent., or about 90, occurred under -the age of 10.1 De\nducting these, we are left with 1,022, which we may take as roughly\nabout one-fourth of the 4,200 which we estimate as the true number.\nWe arrive at the conclusion, then, that, roughly speaking, the number\nof visual hallucinations reported must be multiplied by four to arrive\nat the true number experienced over the age of 10, omitting the sus\npicious cases of the specified types ; and we propose to adopt this\nestimate in dealing with the theory of chance coincidence in Chapter\nXIII.\nAt the same time, it is, of course, improbable that none of the\nsuspicious cases were genuine hallucinations ; and, though other so-\ncalled hallucinations not included in our limited class of suspicious\ncases may not be genuine, it is perhaps unsafe to assume that the\nsuspicious cases afford a true measure of the number of experiences\nmistakenly regarded as hallucinatory. If we include the suspicious\ncases, we shall obtain an outside estimate by calculating the whole\nnumber of visual hallucinations on the basis of the number reported\nwithin the most recent month. We thus get 6,840 as the whole number,\nwhich is equal to about 6i times the reported number. We may\nassume that the truth lies somewhere between the two limits thus\nfound, and nearer to the lower limit than the higher ; but, with the\ndata at our disposal, it does not seem possible to arrive at a more\naccurate estimate.\nIt is worthy of remark that experiences of which the hallucinatory\ncharacter is open to doubt on the grounds we have named, are reported\nin a much larger proportion for the most recent year than for more\nremote periods. Thus, among the particular class of realistic apparitions\nof living persons which furnishes the largest proportion of such sus\npicious cases, we find them distributed as follows over the last 10\nyears. The first column gives the number of suspicious cases, and the\n1 We infer this number, instead of counting it, because in some cases, even when\ndated, the age of the percipient is not given.\nF\n\f66 Report cm the Census of Hallucinations.

Either they are for this reason more quickly\nforgotten, or else a suspicion, often felt by the percipient from the first,\nthat what he saw was a real person or thing, becomes intensified as the\nfirst impression of the oddness of what has occurred wears off. The pre\nvalence of this type of experience among the recent cases partly\naccounts for the disproportionately large number of recent cases,\nespecially among recognised apparitions of the living.\nWe shall deal more briefly with the case of auditory and tactile\nhallucinations. Of the auditory hallucinations reported, 65 occurred\nwithin the last year, and of the tactile, 21. The proportion of these\nnumbers to the total numbers reported (494 and 179 respectively), and to\nthe numbers within the most recent ten years (see Tables VII. and\nVIII.)shows that the forgetfulness of auditory and tactile hallucinations\nis more rapid than that of visual cases, so that a considerably larger\ncorrecting factor would be required. But the, in general, less careful\nreports of the auditory and tactile cases, as well as the smaller\nnumbers we have to deal with, make any calculations respecting them\nless reliable, and it seems hardly worth while to go into further detail ;\nespecially as we should further have to take into account the operation\nof what we have called \" superficial \" forgetfulness (see p. 60).\nOur readers may be inclined to ask what precise value is to be\nattached to the statistics in our tables, if so large a correction has to be\n1 These numbers each include a \" collective \" case in which the experiences of the\ntwo percipients concerned are counted separately (see p. 51, foot-note).\naThis number includes a \"collective\" case, in which the experiences of the three\npercipients concerned are counted separately.\n\fIII.] 67\nForgetfulne88.\nmade for forgetfulness. To this the answer is twofold. In the first\nplace, they furnish a fairly accurate record of the number of hallucina\ntions which are remembered\u2014i.e., of those which are either recent or\nhave strongly impressed the percipient\u2014and of the proportion in which\nthese remembered hallucinations are divided under the various heads.\nIn the second place, they give us the means of comparing the number\nand the impressiveness of different kinds of hallucinations.\nWe can tell, for instance, from Table IV. that apparitions of the\ndead are better remembered than apparitions of the living, because\nmore in proportion of the former than of the latter are reported for the\nperiod more than ten years distant. And this being so, we may infer\nfurther that the memory correction for apparitions of the dead should\nbe somewhat below the average, while that for apparitions of the living\nshould be slightly above it. The comparatively small number of\napparitions of the dead reported in our Census may therefore be taken\nto correspond to the facts, not only as regards hallucinations remembered,\nhut as regards hallucinations experienced. We may also infer that the\nmore rapid forgetfulness of apparitions of the living depends mainly\non the inclusion among them of trivial cases ; for if we omit the 36\nsuspicious cases enumerated above for the most recent ten years\u2014\ndiminishing in number as the years become more remote\u2014we find that\nthe proportion of apparitions in the most recent ten years to those that\noccurred more than ten years ago is almost exactly the same for\napparitions of the living and of the dead respectively.\nThere is one natural inference from Table IV. against which we\nmust guard, viz., that the small class of \" Grotesque \" apparitions is\nbetter remembered than any other. For here the disproportionately\nlarge number of remote cases is in the main due to hallucinations of this\nclass being to a large extent experienced by children. Of the 33\nreported, 14 occurred not only to children, but to children under 11\nyears old, and, owing to the limit of age fixed for informants, all\nhallucinations experienced under 11 years old belong to the remote\nperiod.\nPassing to Table VII , we may observe that hallucinations of the\nvoices of dead persons are somewhat better remembered than other\nvocal hallucinations.\nTurning from the form of the hallucination to the conditions of\nperception, we infer on the same principle from Table VI. that\napparitions seen when the percipient is fully awake in bed are\nsomewhat better remembered than those seen when he is up.\nIt seems likely that the freedom from external distraction, which\nwe conjecture to be one reason why lying in bed is favourable to\nhallucinations (see Chapter IX.), also leads to their being better remem\nbered. It is also worth noticing that there are probably fewer oppor\nf 2\n\f68 [chap.\nReport on the Census of Hallucinations.\ntunities for a real person to be mistaken for a hallucination under\nthese circumstances than when the percipient is up ; and any suspicion\nof a possible mistake probably tends, as we have said, to diminish the\nimpressiveness of an experience.\nHallucinations of the most impressive class will not only be better\nremembered than others, but will, we may reasonably suppose, be\nmore often mentioned by the percipients to their friends. There is\nsome interest therefore in trying to ascertain what kinds are\nmost talked about and seeing how far these are also those shown\nby the tables to be the best remembered. So far as there is agree\nment, the inference as to impressiveness drawn from the tables will\nreceive confirmation.\nNow it is, of course, the kinds most talked about that will be\nmost often known beforehand to our collectors ; and though our\ninstruction to mark the answers previously known to them has not,\nas we have already remarked, been completely carried out, still the\nmarking that has been done gives us important information on the\nsubject. Analysing the affirmative answers which are stated, by\nmarking or otherwise, to have been previously known to the collectors,\nwe find that of the reported realistic apparitions of dead persons 14 per\ncent. were known ; of similar apparitions of living persons 1 1 per cent. ;\nof all other kinds of visual hallucinations 10-5 per cent. ; of auditory\nhallucinations 6 per cent. ; and of tactile hallucinations 6 per cent.1\nThe actual numbers are not to be taken as accurate, because we have\nnot got complete information as to previous knowledge. But there is\nno reason to think that further information would affect the order of\ninterest, and therefore of impressiveness, thus indicated ; and this, as\nregards the superior impressiveness of visual hallucinations over\nauditory and tactile ones, and among visual ones, of apparitions of the\ndead, is the same as the order of impressiveness indicated by amount\nof recollection.\nPossible Omission of Hallucinations under the age of 21.\n(7) A seventh source of error in the statistics has to be mentioned.\nWe have reason to believe that some of our collectors and informants\n\u2014probably not many\u2014interpreted the instruction not to receive\nanswers from persons under 21 to mean that we wished to exclude hal\nlucinations that occurred when the percipient was under that age. If this\nerror had been at all widespread, it might have seriously reduced the\n1 In 4 cases of affirmative answers stated to have been known beforehand, no\ndetails are given, and 29 others belong to experiences of kinds not included in the\nCensus, about 6 per cent. of these being thus stated to have been previously known.\n\fIIL] G9\nTrustwoiihiness of Results.\nnumber of affirmative answers as regards youthful experiences.1 Owing\nto the age of our informants, however, it cannot practically have affected\nthe most recent month or quarter, which has afforded the basis for our\nestimate of the whole number of hallucinations, and therefore its\neffect will be merged in that of forgetfulness, and the correction applied\nfor the latter will cover both.\nSummary of Chapter.\nSumming up now the results of this investigation into the trust\nworthiness of our statistics, we find that, out of seven sources of error\nwhich we have thought of and discussed, five have had on the whole\nno appreciable effect. The sixth, however (namely, forgetfulness),\npossibly in combination with the seventh, has had a very large effect\nindeed, larger probably than most people would expect. We estimate\nthat, in order to arrive at the true number of visual hallucinations\nexperienced by our informants since the age of 10, the reported\nnumber must be multiplied by some number between 4 and 6\u00a3,\nand that, in the case of auditory and tactile hallucinations, a still\nlarger correction would be needful.\nNote.\u2014The accounts of their experiences given by our informants\nare for the most part written on copies of Schedule B (see Appendix\nA) in answer to the specific questions there asked, and only exception\nally in an ordinary narrative form. The accounts quoted are verbatim\nreproductions of those given by the percipients, any changes or inter\npolations\u2014required to bring them into a narrative form \u2014 being\nindicated by the use of square brackets.\n1 This may partly account for the small proportion of hallucinations at early ages\nshown by Table XI. We shall recur to the Bubject of youthful hallucinations later (see\nChapter VIII).\n\f70 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nChapter IV.\nHALLUCINATIONS AND PSEUDO-HALLUCINATIONS.\nIn the discussion which occupies this and the following seven\nchapters, we shall not distinguish between veridical and merely\nsubjective hallucinations. The discussion of veridical cases as such is\ndeferred to Chapters XII. et seq. Further, we shall discuss chiefly\nhallucinations affecting the sense of sight, as, besides being the\nmost numerous, they show much more variety than auditory or\ntactile hallucinations, and what has to be said about hallucina\ntions in general can, therefore, usually be best illustrated from\nthis class.\nIn this and in the next chapter we shall be mainly engaged in\nexplaining, and illustrating from the cases in our Census, the most\nimportant lines of distinction between sensory hallucinations and other\nphenomena with which they are liable to be confounded. These other\nphenomena may be divided into four classes.\n1. Ordinary sense-perceptions :\n2. Dreams :\n3. Mental images recognised as such, including what are hereafter\ncalled \"pseudo-hallucinations : \"\n4. Illusions.\nUnder the first two heads there is not much that needs to be said.\n(1) We follow the authors of Phantasms ofthe Living,1 in distin\nguishing sensory hallucinations from ordinary sense-perceptions\u2014as well\nas from ordinary mental images\u2014by the characteristic that the halluci\nnatory percept 2 \" lacks, but can only by distinct reflection be recognised\nas lacking, the objective basis that it suggests.\" In most cases the\napplication of the distinction is simple and obvious : but occasionally\nthe process of subsequent reflection, by which a percipient convinces\nhimself of the lack of objective basis, is of doubtful certainty : as (e.g.)\nwhen a figure seen at some distance out of doors is inferred to have\nbeen hallucinatory because it disappeared in what the percipient\nregards as an inexplicable manner. We have already had occasion to\nnotice this source of uncertainty in speaking of \" suspicious cases \" in\n1 Vol. I., Chapter X., page 459.\n2 We have allowed ourselves, for convenience, to use the term \" hallucination \"\nsometimes for the experience of apparently perceiving a physical fact that is not\nreally presented, sometimes for the object apparently perceived ; for the latter use,\nhowever, we have, to prevent confusion, occasionally substituted the term \" halluci\nnatory object \" or \" percept.\"\n\fIV.] 71\nHallucinations and Paeudo-Hallucinations.\nthe preceding chapter ; and we shall give further illustrations of it in\nthe one that follows.\n(2) The distinction between dreams and sensory hallucinations is\ndifferent. In a wide sense of the term, indeed, dreams of the sensory\nsort may be regarded as \" pure cases of hallucination \" 1 : since the\ndream-perceptions, like waking hallucinations, are at the time believed\nto have an objective basis, which they really lack. But in this Census\nwe have confined ourselves to hallucinations in the ordinary sense, dis\ntinguished from dreams by occurring in the waking state. Ordinarily,\nof course, this distinction is quite clear : each person's dream-scenes\nare separated from our common physical world by an unmistakable\nchasm, which he crosses in the conscious transition from sleep to\nwaking. There are, however, a small number of exceptional cases in\nwhich we have found some difficulty in drawing the line. Thus\u2014as\nwas stated in Chapter II., p. 36\u2014we have, in seven answers, had\nreports of dream-images and nightmares persisting into the waking\nstate, and, in twenty-one answers, of voices, or touches, rousing the\npercipient from sleep; which we, after consideration, decided to exclude\nfrom the Census, as belonging to the phenomena of sleep. On the\nother hand, we have included a small number of hallucinatory\nexperiences at the moment of waking which were\u2014manifestly or pro\nbably\u2014connected with antecedent dreams ; either because there was\na distinct difference in nature between the sleeping and the waking\nphenomenon, or because the dream-image persisted under conditions\nof marked waking activity. Of the three instances that follow, the\nfirst exemplifies the excluded cases, while the second and third are\nspecimens of those included.\n(257. 3.;1 From Miss M. H. M.\nFebruary, 1890.\n\" About fifteen years ago, .... I had gone to sleep without\nknowing it, a fire burning opposite the foot of my bed.

So I lay\ndown and went to sleep again, and saw no more.\"\n(733. 5.) From Mrs. S.\nMarch 29th, 1892.\n\" I once dreamed that a large black butterfly was hovering over my\nhusband as he lay in bed. I awoke and saw, by the aid of the nightlight,\nthe butterfly of my dream fluttering over him. I called the servant and\ntogether we tried to kill it. I struck at it with my handkerchief and\napparently succeeded in my object, but all our endeavours to find the body\nof the insect failed. The doors and windows were all closed and it could\nnot have escaped. It was very large and could not have remained invisible.\nThe black woman saw the butterfly as I did, till I struck at it. We are of\nopinion, as we searched so carefully, that it was merely hallucinatory.\"\n(We need not here discuss the alleged sharing of the hallucination by\nthe black woman, of which we only know at second-hand. Shared or\n\" collective \" hallucinations are treated of in Chapter XV.)\nWith regard to the form taken by the hallucination, the collector,\nProfessor Alexander, writes : \u2014\n\" According to a superstition widely spread in Brazil the black butterfly\nis supposed to be a sign of death. I have heard several tales similar to the\naccount given [here] that tend to show that hallucinations are often\nshaped by popular beliefs.\"\n(729. 17.) From Dr. J. P.\nFebruary 20th, 1892.\n\" I woke one night hearing the words, ' John, don't you know me V I\nopened my eyes and saw a Mr. L., who had died some years before, and\nwith whom I had been very familiar.

But\nwhere we have no positive evidence of such a connection, we have not\nhesitated to include these among hallucinations.\n(3) The third distinction presents greater difficulties.

We\npropose, accordingly, in the remainder of the present chapter,\nto discuss and illustrate fully this line of distinction ; leaving the\nline between hallucinations and illusions to be drawn in the next\nchapter.\nWe will begin by giving typical instances of unmistakable\nhallucinations ; taking them from the class of realistic hallucinations\nrepresenting human beings, which, it will be observed, are far the\nmost numerous in our collection. We take specimens from all the\nthree classes into which we have divided these apparitions, namely :\napparitions of the living, of the dead, and of unrecognised persons.\n(284. 23.) From Mr. Joseph Kirk.\n2, Ripon Villas, Upper Ripon-road, Plumstead, April, 1890.\n\"My experience occurred about four years ago, at the house I now\noccupy, and in daylight. I have always had an objection to a servant having lo\ngo out for anything before breakfast. But at this time it frequently happened\nthat the milkman was not punctual to time, and milk had to be sent for.\nThis was a cause of annoyance to us, because I was compelled to leave home\nby 9.30 a.m., and, after waiting for the milkman to the last moment, the girl\nhad to run out in a hurry. I was always made aware, while still in my dress\ning-room, when this was the case. The latch-lock of the front basement\ndoor was out of order, and a strong pull from outside was necessary to shut\nit. This always resulted in a loud bang. (Note the bang.)\n\"On the morning I experienced the hallucination, I was in my dressing-\nroom, and was about half-way through the process of dressing when I heard\nthe sound T was so familiar with\u2014this bang\u2014and concluded that the milk\nman was again too late, and that the girl had once more to go for milk. I\nexperienced a momentary feeling of annoyance only, so far as I can re\nmember ; at any rate, I had forgotten the subject before I left the room.\n\" My dressing-room is on the first floor at the back of the house, and I\nhave only to step out of it and at once descend a flight of stairs to reach the\nbasement. The breakfast-room is in front of the house on this basement,\nand there is a superior kitchen behind it. At this time it was a weekly\ncustom to have the breakfast-room thoroughly over-hauled early in the\nmorning, and the breakfast laid, for that morning, in the kitchen. It was\nso this morning. The foot of the stairs is close to the kitchen door.\n\"As I descended the stairs to breakfast, I saw Mary (the servant) approach\ning me from the basement door, dressed, as usual when on an errand, in her\nbrown straw hat, black cloth jacket, and light print frock ; and I had only\njust time to reach the kitchen door to permit her to pass behind me, without\nstopping, on her way towards the scullery.\n\" The instant I entered the kitchen I observed to my wife, ' So Mary has\nhad to go for milk again.' 'No,' she replied, 'she has not.' 'But,' I\nexclaimed, * I have just seen her, dressed, come from the front door ; and\nbesides, I heard the door banged as she went out.'

' Mary has not been out this morning, and she is now in the break-\nfost-room at work.'\n\" There was no doubt that such was the case, and that, instead of having\nseen the real Mary, I had had a very vivid and life-like hallucination of her.\nIt would be natural to suggest that it was the girl herself I had seen, and that\nshe had merely left the breakfast-room for something she wanted from the\nscullery. But servants do not usually set about in-door work dressed in out\ndoor costume ; and, had she not seemed to me to be wearing her hatand jacket,\nI should simply have thought it was the girl herself, and made no remark.\"\nIn the following case the apparition represented the percipient\nherself.1\n(555. 5.) From Miss A. B. O.\nJanuary, 1892.\n\" In June, 1889, about 8-9 p.m., [it] being quite light at the time, I saw,\nnear in Scotland, a figure approaching me, which, on coming near, I\ndiscovered was the double of myself, except that the figure, which wore a\nwhite dress, had a charming smile. I also wore a white dress ; the figure\nhad black on its hands, whether gloves or mittens I do not know. I had\nneither. It was out of doors, coming down a garden walk. On holding\nout my hand to it, the figure vanished. [I was] 24 years old, in robust\nhealth, and not in anxiety or grief at the time.\"\n(19. 23.) From Miss C. C.\nMay, 1889.\n\"I was writing in my sitting-room at our home in Derbyshire one after\nnoon in summer. My table faced the open door. I lookod up and saw my\nfather commg in with papers in his hand, big blue official looking papers,\nand a look in his face I had seen a thousand times, a sort of amused look, as\nif some one had been very funny, in the unconscious way people ore funny,\nand he was coming to share the amusement with me. For an instant I\nforgot he was no longer on the earth, and I looked up expecting him to\nspeak, and half rose to push across to him the chair he liked to use\u2014when\nthere was just nothing. There is nothing for evermore.\n\" That is all. Just a vivid dream, I suppose, not worth speaking of, and I\nnever have spoken of it to anyone. You ask for a date. My father left us\non April 12th, 1883, and it was in the summer of 1884, about June, I think,\nthat I thought I saw him, as I have said.

The following account is given by a medical man, Mr. C. T. G. :\u2014\nAprd 14th, 1892.\n\"About six months ago, in small hours a.m., I thought I saw a figure of\na young man. [I was] in very good health, no anxiety ; not the slightest\nfright at the appearance. I awoke suddenly, feeling absolutely awake. . . .\n\" I saw the figure in bright movnlight.

The blind was drawn fully up.\n\" I could see it was figure of a man dressed in black morning coat, no\ntat; figure was turned towards the window, so that I only could see\na three-quarter back view and not the face. I hoped and wished it would\nmove and turn round and become more distinct ; it did none of these. Time\nseen seemed about a minute or two\u2014probably only a few seconds.

The phantasm appears to stand side by side\nwith real objects, and the percipient is usually deceived for the\n1 For other experiences of the same percipient, see p. 86.\n\f76 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nmoment into thinking it as real as they. The conviction that it is not\nreal is due, not to a difference in the hallucinatory percept, but to an\nexercise of the reflective judgment. The mode of appearance and dis\nappearance, the appeal to another sense, the impossibility that a real\nperson should have been there\u2014points, in short, which are only\napprehended by reflection\u2014are the considerations on which the judg\nment depends.\nTo cases such as these, and they form the majority of our collection,\nthere is no difficulty in applying the definition ; the experience is\nclearly a hallucination. But in a certain number of cases there is a\ndifficulty in deciding whether the phantasmal object appeared suffi\nciently external for the experience to be regarded as strictly a halluci\nnation, or whether it rather belonged to the type conveniently called\nby Kandinsky \" pseudo-hallucinations.\"1\nPseudo-hallucinations may be defined as having all the character\nistics of hallucinations, except that of complete externalisation. They\nare unlike the ordinary images of fancy or memory, which we\nvoluntarily call up, in being spontaneous, and in being more vivid and\ndetailed, and more steady. Like hallucinations, they cannot be called\nup, nor their form altered, at will. On the other hand, they are unlike\nhallucinations proper, in not seeming to the percipient to be perceived\nthrough the senses. It is with the eye of the mind, not the bodily\neye, that he seems to see them ; with the mental, not the bodily, ear\nthat he seems to hear them ; and accordingly they do not even suggest\nthe presence of a corresponding corporeal reality. The difference\nbetween pseudo-hallucinations and hallucinations proper is well brought\nout by the following description, sent to us by a lady who had\nexperienced both kinds.\nFrom Miss C. B. M.\n(This case did not come to us through the Census.)\n\" When I first saw persons who I knew were not creatures of imagina\ntion, nor yet corporeally present, they seemed to be pictured just within,\ninstead of before my eyes. One afternoon in the fall of 1863, while engaged\nin some household work, an elderly woman suddenly appeared to me in that\nmanner. She wore spectacles, was plainly dressed, and had an unsightly\nbend in the front of her bonnet, which showed she had not put it on before\na mirror. She stood a few feet below my level, and her face wore a look of\nanxious inquiry as she tipped back her head to scan me through the\nspectacles. She remained several minutes with no change of attitude or\nexpression. With my eyes open or closed, she was there.\n\" During the last six years, these phantoms have usually been projected\ninto space, and I seem to see them by the ordinary method of vision. I\nhave been near-sighted from birth and experience the same difficulty in\n1 Kritischc und klinische Betraehtungen im Gebiete der SinnetUititehungen.\u2014\nBerlin, 1885.\n\fIV.] 77\nHallucinations and Pseudo-Hallucinations.\ndiscerning the unreal that I do when viewing real objects ; unless the\npersons come near, I cannot clearly distinguish their features. However\nreal the apparitions at first appear, a close inspection reveals that they have\nno solidity ; other objects can be seen through them.\n\" The persons and places making up some scene of everyday life are\ngenerally enclosed in globes, I call them for convenience, which are\napparently of the consistency of a soap bubble. These are sometimes white,\nsometimes shadowy, but oftener show one of the prismatic colours, like a\ndew-drop in the sunlight. The first that I noticed was in the evening, after\nthe light was extinguished. In the dark, they have a semi-transparent\nwhiteness, yet are illuminated within, so that what they picture is distinctly\nrisible. This one revolved, not very rapidly, from west to east, one side in\nshadow, the other showing glimpses of trees, houses, &c. By-and-bye it\nsteadied itself, as if it had been unrolling a coil and had reached the end.\nThen I saw a large house and a leafless tree at one end of it. A window in\nthe second storey was uncurtained, and within, at a table on which a lamp\nwas burning, sat a man writing. His back was toward me. He now and then\npaused and raised his head as if following some errant thought, showing by\nhis movements as well as by his figure and heavy suit of dark hair, that he\nwas young and athletic. While studying this new phase of appearances, I\nfelt some one near, and turning my head saw close by my side an old lady in\na poke bonnet. Her features were small and she fixed a pair of very black\neyes long and searchingly on my face. As I moved again, directly in front\nof me was a young girl clad in white ; her face was exquisitely fair and\nsweet. At the time I had an odd suspicion that these were connected with\nthe writer in the upper room, that somehow he had sent them.\n\" Not long after, while conversing with friends, and seated where the rays\nof the sun came full into the room from an opposite window, a transparent\nylobe sailed in on a beam of light with active persons inside, but I could not\nwatch them without attracting attention. From that time, in the dark and\niu the broad glare of day, I have seen, enshrined in the globes, images of\ntowns, cities, lakes, rivers, boats, ships, the interior and exterior of churches,\nworkshops, dwellings, houses, carriages ; in short, all the busy scenes of life\nand labour in their most intense activity. These pictures\u2014as I believe, of\nactual life\u2014seem literally borne on ' the wings of the wind.' Often when a\ndoor is opened, they rush in like messengers in haste. One November\nafternoon in 1882, on looking from my bedroom window, I saw a huge globe\nwhirling rapidly in a dark cloud far away in the north-east. There was no\nbreeze stirring outside then, but five minutes later a strong wind from that\ndirection swept down the street. The globes have four apparent motions ;\nthey revolve, move forward or backward in a direct line, vibrate as a pendu\nlum, or spring up and down like a catch ball attached to an elastic cord.\nTheir size seems to depend mainly upon distance, being largest at the\nfarthest point, diminishing in size as they approach. ... I have never\nby an effort of will been successful in summoning any apparition. They\ncome and go in their own way. It is when I am at my best physically, and\nmy mental faculties keenly interested in something, that the pictures are\nmost frequent and vivid. They are mostly quite the antipodes of my\nmental occupation. \"\n\f78 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nWith the first experience described by Miss M., may be compared\na veridical experience (No. 27) in Phantasms of the Living, Vol. I.,\np. 209, which the percipient thus describes :\u2014\n\" I was dressing one morning in December, 1881, when a certain con\nviction came upon me that someone was in my dressing-room. On looking\nround I saw no one, but then, instantaneously (in my mind's eye, I\nsuppose), every feature of the face and form of my old friend, X., arose.\nThis, as you may imagine, made a great impression on me. . . .\"\nKandinsky thinks the two phenomena, pseudo-hallucination and\nhallucination proper, so fundamentally different that if a percipient\nknows by his own experience what a genuine hallucination is, it is\nquite impossible for him to mistake a pseudo-hallucination for it.1\nWe are inclined rather to think that there are circumstances\nwhere even a person accustomed to both experiences may be in\ndoubt.2 But in any case, as our informants have not generally had\nboth experiences, and as pseudo-hallucinations are sometimes very\nimpressive phenomena, it is necessary to scrutinise the descriptions\nwith care, lest any pseudo-hallucinations have crept in unawares.\nThe difficulty in drawing the line occurs especially in two classes of\ncases.\n(1) Apparitions Seen in the Dark.\nThe first of these is the class of apparitions seen in the dark when\nthe percipient's real surroundings are invisible, so that the phantasm\ncannot stand among them and be compared with them in the same way\nas in the light.\nWith sane and healthy people, mental images which, from their\ninvoluntariness and vividness, may be called pseudo-hallucinations, are\nnot uncommon in the period between sleeping and waking, or of com\nposing themselves to sleep\u2014they are then the illusions hypnagogiques\nof Maury. These would, of course, generally occur with closed eyes,\nand therefore, would be excluded from our tables, as explained on\np. 36, even if reported as hallucinations. This rule we adopted, not\nbecause we regarded a genuine visual hallucination with closed eyes as\nan impossibility, but because the great majority of the phenomena of\nthis kind are at most pseudo-hallucinations , and we could not expect\neither to distinguish true hallucinations from the others by means of\nthe descriptions given or to obtain a sufficiently complete record of\nthem to serve any statistical purpose.\nThings seen in actually complete darkness, but with eyes open\u2014as\n1 He believes that the two phenomena are physiologically different, a part of the\nbrain coming into operation in hallucinations which does not play any part in pseudo\nhallucinations.\n3 Kandinsky seems practically to admit this in another part of his essay.\n\fIV.] Hallucinations and Psewlo-HaUucinations. 79\nthe percipient believed\u2014belong to a somewhat different category, and\nhave required careful consideration. Some of them are undoubtedly\nhallucinations, but in other cases there is some uncertainty. On the\nwhole, we have decided that apparitions which, notwithstanding the\ndarkness, seemed to the percipient to be seen occupying a definite place\nin his room\u2014standing by his bed, for instance\u2014should be classed as\ngenuine hallucinations, and that others were to be regarded as\nprobably pseudo-hallucinations. The number of apparitions seen in\nthe dark thus included in our tables is 30.1\nIn 17 of the 30 cases, the figure alone appeared illuminated,\nsometimes seeming phosphorescent or emitting a special light of its\nown, as in No. 607. 1 (see p. 117); sometimes surrounded by a\nluminous aura or halo, as in the case next to be quoted ; sometimes\nmerely appearing as a real person would in the light, but with nothing\nelse visible round it, as in No. 192.^21 (see p. 139) ; and No. 740. 9\n(Miss M.'s case, Chapter XVII).\n(37. 13.) From Miss H. Wilson.\nOctober 18th, 1887.\n\" A long time ago I was lying asleep, or nearly so, one night, when I felt\na hand laid gently on my shoulder. I was not surprised or frightened. I\nthought it was my sister Alice, who shared the same room with me, and I\nwas too sleepy to rouse myself till I felt the hand pressing more heavily as\nif to wake me ; then I said, ' What is it, Alice ? What do you want ? ' and\nat the same time opened my eyes. No candle or lamp was in the room, it\nwas quite dark ; but close to my bedside stood, enveloped in light, a figure\nlike my sister\u2014it seemed my own sister Alice ; there was the golden-brown\nhair, blue eyes, and fair complexion, and yet it looked like a being from\nanother world, standing in light unlike any earthly light\u2014a beautiful\nglorified being ! It stood for a few moments, then vanished, and the room\nwas all darkness again. I felt deep awe, but no fear.\"\nIn 12 other cases out of the 30 the room appeared illuminated,\nthough it was really dark ; in three of these the figure seemed to\nemit the light (e.y., No. 33.25, a case published in Proceedings S.P.R.,2\nVol. V., p. 462) ; in the others, the room and figure both seemed to be\nlighted in an ordinary manner, as in the following :\u2014\n(196. 17.) From Miss E. M. J.\n(The account was written in 1889.)\n\" One night in the year 1882 or 1883, I awoke completely and sat up in\nbed. There was light enough in the room to see all the objects in it\n1 In the great majority of cases of hallucinations experienced when the percipient\nwag in bed, the room was not completely dark.\n2 Eighteen persons,whose experiences had previously been published in Phantasm*\nof tiie Living or the Proctedingt S.P.R., happen to have been included in the Census.\n\f80 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap*\ndistinctly. My bed faced the door. Coming from the door, which was shut,\nI saw distinctly, and noticed the dress she had on, a lady friend staying in\nthe house. She was advancing on her hands and knees. My first thought\nwas that she had suddenly lost her reason. I asked her what she wanted.\nShe did not answer but disappeared under the bed. I leaned over the side\nof the bed to see if I could see her, believing her really to be there ; almost\nimmediately the room became quite dark. I had no feeling of fear, and I\nam sure that I was wide awake. I was teaching at the time, and had been\noverworking. I was in the habit of seeing the lady almost daily, and had\ndone so for some years. She was presumably asleep in bed at the time on\nthe other side of the passage. I was alone.\"\nThe remaining case, which follows, seems intermediate between these\ntwo types.\n(53. 21.) From Miss F. D.\n(The account was written in 1889.)\n\"I saw two figures dressed in brown, monkish habits, with cowls over\ntheir heads, and long grey beards. They appeared to come out of a cup\nboard in my room and walk to the bedside. I had been asleep, but awoke\nin fright. Opposite the bed was a recess in the wall, not deep, which was\nilluminated by a phosphorescent light. The apparition, both of figures and\nlight, continued for some minutes, until I had time to light a candle,\nwhen it disappeared. This took place in the year 1879.\"\nIf the following specimen of what we regard as a pseudo-hallucina\ntion\u2014and therefore do not include in our statistics\u2014be compared with\nthe cases just quoted, the difference will be clear.\n(37. 23.) From Mr. J. W. A.\n(The account was written in 1889.)\n\"Over and over again I have seen faces in the dark. Lying in bed,\nbroad awake, faces have come out suddenly in the darkness near my bed,\nappearing, some hideous, some beautiful, and generally extremely vivid.\nHere is a particular instance. I had been reading of Brynhilda and lay\nin bed thinking about her life ; when out there came on the darkness a\ngrand face\u2014worth anyone's toil to transfer to canvas\u2014and so vivid that\nnow, after several years' interval, I could make a picture of it if I could only\ndraw. In general, however, these faces seem to have no connection with\nany particular person or name. They occur most commonly when I am\nvery tired.\"\nIt may interest our readers to give here two other instances of\npseudo-hallucinations between sleeping and waking, which illustrate\ndifferent types.\n(38. 11.) From Professor M.\nMay 25th, 1889.\n\" My imagination was vividly impressed by the Exhibition of 1851,and for\nlong after, perhaps a year or more, I used to like to shut my eyes when I\n\fHalluci7iation$ and Pseudo-Hallucinations. 81\nVent to bed and keep very still, and gradually out of the darkness there\nwould come rolling towards me a gorgeous billow covered with bright\nobjects, and then another, and then another ; and they would get brighter\nand brighter and then gradually fade away. In this sense I had no control\nover them, that I never knew what was coming next, and the first time they\ncame it must have been entirely without any willing on my part. But\nafterwards my will used often to help them on. I recollect, however, that\nI could not always get them when I wanted. (The billow shape of the\nappearances probably had its origin in those long trestles, covered generally\nwith red cloth, and laden with all manner of goods, that are to be seen at\nexhibitions.) I was in delicate health, subject to headaches of a severity\nwhich is, I believe, very rare, and apt to have my sensitiveness to outward\nimpressions vary very much.\"\n(478. 4.) From Miss M. Bramston.\n\" On the night of Thursday, October 6th, as I was settling to sleep, I saw\nbefore my eyes a picture of two strips of still shining water, with trees on\ntheir banks reflected in them, one behind the other ; the trees seemed to change\nas I looked, being sometimes ordinary hedgerow trees, then pollard willows,\nthen hedgerow trees again. I watched the picture with great pleasure, think\ning with my waking senses how pretty it was. The next day I was returning\nfrom Folkestone to London, and the floods were out in places beside the line.\nI saw two strips of shining water, one behind the other, with trees reflected\nin them, just as in my hypnagogic picture. As the train went on the tree\nreflections changed, and one strip of flood on the other side of the train had\npollard willows reflected in it. I had not consciously realised that the rain\nwe had been having was likely to produce floods, but certainly the reality\nseemed curiously to correspond to the hypnagogic picture.\nReturning to fully externalised hallucinations seen in the dark,\nthe apparent illumination of the real objects in the room, which, as we\nhave seen, accompanies many of them, is a noteworthy phenomenon.\nIt seems possible that it is of the same nature as an experience which\nis not uncommon with some persons, namely, that on waking in the\ndark the whole room appears light for a short time. One informant\nwho has several times experienced this, describes the impression\nas \" a momentary flash \" ; in other cases there is merely a vague im\npression of dazzling light on first opening the eyes. It has been\nsuggested that such experiences may be due to hyperesthesia\u2014a\ngreater sensitiveness to light, and consequent power of seeing in what\nordinarily appears to be darkness\u2014just at the moment of waking, after\nthe eyes have been for some time in a condition of repose.1 Cases like\n1 Eight out of the nine cases in which the room seemed illuminated and a figure\nappeared in it occurred within a few moments after waking, and in three of these\ncases the experience recurred several times in the same way to the same percipient.\nG\n41, Dingwall-road, Croydon, October 13th, 1892.\n\" M. Bramston.i1\n\f82 [chap.\nReport on the Census of Hallucinations.\nthat of Miss Mason, one of our informants (quoted in Proceedings\nS.P.R., Vol. VIII., p. 372), who saw her room as it really was, but not\nas she imagined it to be, certainly suggest the hypothesis of real vision\nof real objects ; and there is an analogous case (not in our present\ncollection) where the light accompanying an apparition revealed an\nobject\u2014a gun\u2014in the place it really occupied, but not where the\npercipient fancied it was. This, however, is no proof that the vision\nof it was not an externalised memory image, as the percipient,\nhaving placed his gun in that particular position himself, must have\nbeen subconsciously aware of its true position, which was, in\nfact, that in which he had last actually seen it. A hypothesis\nwhich involves the assumption that an abnormal experience is in part\nhallucinatory, and in part due to a hypersesthetic condition, seems\nsomewhat strained in the absence of any direct evidence of a connec\ntion between hyperesthesia and hallucination. It seems simpler to\nsuppose the room to be seen hallucinatorily, like the figure in it, the\nilluminated room being an externalised memory image, suggested by\nthe percipient's consciousness of where he is. There seems no reason\nto assume a fundamental difference between an apparent illumination\nof the real room in which the percipient is, and a vision of an\nilluminated room, like the following :\u2014\n(421. 9.) From Mr. A. C. B.\nMarch 7th, 1891.\n\"From the time when I was about 12 years old to my present age (22),\nI have often, when waking in middle of the night, found the room apparently\nblazing with light, heard loud music, generally of a band, and seen a number\nof men and women, generally dancing or in rapid motion ; men and women\nin evening clothes, women in white. This has gradually disappeared in\nabout 5 to 10 seconds from the time when I awoke. Sometimes the\nimpressions were very distinct, sometimes weak. But I was always wide\nawake when they occurred, and often made distinct attempts to recognise\nfaces, unsuccessfully, and to remember distinctly the impressions. Once\nabout three years ago, after the usual impression had faded away, I saw a\nman in a brown dress of last century at the foot of my bed. I did not\nrecognise his face, and there was nothing remarkable about him. These\nimpressions never made me at all afraid.\n\"Age from 12\u201422. The impressions have lately occurred less frequently.\nMy health has always been good, though I am slightly nervous. I have never\nsuffered from any particular grief or anxiety.\"\nMr. B. writes further :\u2014\n\" As to the light, 1 did not see the room by it as it is, but a completely\ndifferent room, of which I had only a very vague impression. There was\nalways a mirror, the most luminous thing in the room, directly opposite me,\nthough there might be no real glass in the room at all. There is no un\nfamiliar position of a familiar object. I imagine the light is altogether a\npart of the hallucination, which is of course purely subjective.\"\n\fiv.] Hallucinations and Pseudo-Hallucinations. 83\n(2) Visions.\nThe second class of cases in which the line between hallucinations\nand pseudo-hallucinations is often peculiarly difficult to draw is the\nclass which we have called \" Visions.\" By \" visions,\" as already said\nin explaining the tables, we mean scenes or pictures, or sometimes\nsingle figures or faces, which do not seem to belong to the percipient's\nactual surroundings.\nThere is no question that the vision is adequately externalised when\nit is quite definitely located among the percipient's actual surroundings\nas seen at the time ; for instance,when it is seen on a reflecting or other\nsurface, as in No. 406. 25. (see p. 106) ; or when the wall seems to open\nand the vision to be seen through it, as in No. 442. 15 (Mrs. B.'s case\nin Chapter XVII). In other cases, the relation of the hallucinatory\nobject to the percipient's surroundings is less definite, but the re\nsemblance of the apparent perception to ordinary vision is still\nunmistakable ; the case given on the preceding page. No. 421. 9, is\nan instance of this. But between these and mental pictures many\ngradations seem to occur, and neither the percipients nor ourselves\ncan always feel sure on which side of the line dividing externalised\nfrom non-externalised visions particular cases should come. A couple\nof cases will illustrate the difficulty. The following is one which,\nafter some hesitation, we have decided was a pseudo-hallucination, and\nhave accordingly not included in our tables.\n(42. 25.) From Miss C. P. M. C\n(The account was written in the beginning of June, 1889.)\n\"I distinctly saw a person whom I knew (M. T.) lying in bed, and the\nroom and furniture exactly as I last saw it. I had the impression of hearing\nher voice. The impression was so vivid that for the time it stopped my\nreading, and I remember being surprised at it and wondering whether the\nwoman were alive or dead. I had had a letter three days previously saying\nshe was dying. She had been an invalid when I first saw her, so that I never\nknew her otherwise than in bed.\n\" Place : probably in the Geological Museum. Date : May 14th, 1889,\nTuesday, in the morning.\n\"I was reading geology [at the time].

Once,\nwhen a child, being in bed but certainly awake, I remember hearing voices\nof people I knew well who were far away at the time.\"\nMiss C. gave an account of this experience verbally to the collector,\nMiss Alice Johnson, before writing it down. For the exact date she referred\nG 2\n\f84 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nto a small diary, in which she had noted some incident that she remembered\nhad happened on the same day as her vision.\nWe find from the Register at Somerset House that M. T. died at the\nHospital for Incurables, Heaton Norris, Stockport, on May 14th, 1889.\nMiss C. explained that the other \"impressions\" she mentioned were of\nthe nature of vivid visualisations. She describes these further in a letter\nwritten some time later :\u2014\nJuly 9th, 1892.\n\" I perfectly well remember telling you my experience of having had\na 'vision,' as you call it. The incident itself I still remember vividly,\nthough the surroundings are rather dimmed. It happened one morning\nthat I was doing practical work in the Laboratory.1 Suddenly, as by a\nsort of flash, I saw M. T. before me, lying in bed as I had seen her last,\nand I remember thinking and wondering was she dead ; and it struck me\nthen how strange it was it should flash across me so suddenly, when I was\nintent upon my work ; it required a considerable effort of will to return to\nmy work afterwards. Of course it must be remembered that I knew she\nwas very ill and likely to die ; she was in an incurable hospital, and I had\nbeen interesting myself a few months previously in getting her elected as\na free inmate.\n\" So much for the facts. I don't think I have ever had any other such\nexperience which impressed me so much and of which I remember the\ndetails so well. This one occurred at the very time Miss T. died, or with\nin half-an-hour of it. I think I told you I had a faint recollection of some\nthing like it having happened when I was a school-girl, but no distinct\nimpression remains. It seems to me that everybody can more or less\nvoluntarily visualise persons and scenes. I can do it so that the people are\nvery nearly, if not quite, as vivid as if they were actually before me, and I\ncan hold imaginary conversations with them.\n\" It sometimes happens that while I am quite occupied, spontaneously\nsome one comes up before me whom I have not seen or thought about\nat all for a long time. I think about them for a little time, possibly saying\nto myself, ' Why do I think of so and so now ? ' and then I quite naturally\ncease to think of them, but I have never before found that anything\nhappened to these people at these times.\n\" [The case of] Miss T. impressed me so much, first, because it was\nso vivid ; second, because I heard a day or two afterwards that she had\ndied at that time. You happened to speak to me about the psychological\ninvestigations soon afterwards, otherwise it would probably have faded\nfrom my memory. Of these vivid impressions of people I have just men\ntioned, I remember only two for certain since Easter ; others may have\noccurred, but no impression remains.\"\nOn the other hand, we have decided to class as a hallucination\nthe following case of a dream-like apparition, because the feeling of\nspatial relation to the vision was prominent in the percipient's mind.\n1 Doubtless a mistake from lapse of memory, as the previous account says, \" in\nthe museum.\" Miss C. was in the habit of working in both places about that\ntime.

I was in my room (I was\nthen residing in the North of England, quite 100 miles away from Miss\nMorton's home), preparing for bed, between 12 and half-past, when I seemed\nsuddenly to be standing close to the door of the housemaid's cupboard,\nfacing the short flight of stairs leading to the top landing. Coming\ndown these stairs, I saw the figure, exactly as described, and about\ntwo steps behind Miss Morton herself, with a dressing-gown thrown\nloosely round her, and carrying a candle in her hand.

She wrote\nan account to me the next day of what she had seen, and asked me if I had not\nseen the figure that night ; but naturally did not know that I had done so,\nuntil she received my reply. Miss Campbell asks me to say that this is\nthe only vision she has had, veridical or otherwise.\"\nSense of Presence.\nWe pass to consider a kind of experience the discussion of which\nwill further illustrate the difficulties of classification with which we are\nnow dealing. This is an impression of the near presence of someone,\nin which no sensation, either of sight, hearing, or touch, appears to be\ninvolved. We cannot regard it as strictly a sensory hallucination, and\naccordingly we have not included any instance of it in our Tables; still,\nit involves a more or less definite quasi-perception of the occupation of\nspace in the neighbourhood of the percipient. The impression, in a\nslight degree, is familiar to most people, and is probably sometimes\ncaused by slight sounds, movements of the air, dtc, of which the\norigin is undetected, and the existence perhaps not consciously per\nceived. But, in the degree in which we are now concerned with it, the\nimpression does not seem explicable in this way, and it is often so\nstrong as to appear to the percipient a very striking phenomenon, and\nto produce a great effect on his mind.\n\f86 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nProfessor James, who has met with a good many instances of it\namong the affirmative answers to the Census of Hallucinations in\nAmerica, says {Principles of Psychology, Vol. II., p. 322) :\u2014\n\" From the way in which this experience is spoken of by those who\nhave had it, it would appear to be an extremely definite and positive\nstate of mind, coupled with a belief in the reality of its object quite as\nstrong as any direct sensation ever gives. And yet no sensation seems\nto be connected with it at all. . . . The phenomenon would seem\nto be due to a pure conception becoming saturated with the sort of\nstinging urgency which ordinarily only sensations bring.\"\nThe effect of the experience on the percipient may be the greater\nfrom its being completely non-sensory, since this would make it appear\nmore unaccountable. Similarly, voices or sounds coming from nothing\nvisible are often more startling than visual hallucinations, as being\nprimdfacie more unaccountable. This is perhaps the reason why stories\nof \" haunted houses \" in which nothing happens, except that mysterious\nnoises are heard, appeal so strongly to the popular imagination ; and\nwhen an impression is produced of the presence of an object imper\nceptible by any sense, the mysterious effect is heightened still further.\nThe narrative that follows describes a series of such impressions,\noccurring to the percipient of case (661.5) quoted above (see p. 74).\n(661. 5) Mr. H. writes :\u2014\nFebruary 29tt, 1892.\n\"In September,1890, 1 was reading for entrance [to the University]. About\n11p.m. Iwas engaged with Cicero,De Senectute,in a little room I have formerly\nused as a snug and studio for painting.I suddenly became conscious ofa feeling\nthat some one else was present. I looked round, expecting to see my mother,\nwho had occasionally come in, for I had several times left the lamp burning\nall night ; but I saw no one. I examined the room, measuring about 16\nfeet x 8 feet. I expected to find my mother hid behind a large studio easel ;\nshe is fond of practical jokes. There was no one there. Very puzzled, I\ncommenced reading, or rather tried to do so, for I had only time to place the\nbook in front of me when I became convinced of some one looking over my\nshoulder. I took an old constable's staff which I used for a ruler, as though\nI intended to use it, and suddenly turned round and saw\u2014no one. At this\ntime 1 never gave spiritual phenomena a thought. I went round the room\nagain and off to bed, very puzzled indeed. About a little more than a year\nafterwards\u2014Oct., 1891\u2014I was smoking in another man's rooms here.\nI was alone, and was leisurely turning over Thomson's Lawi of Thought.\nand I experienced the same feeling very intensely. I did not at the moment\nthink of my former experience, but, being a freshman, I naturally thought\nof some trick, but I found no one. I then began to feel\u2014shall I say\nknow ?\u2014that a woman was present. I put it down to hallucination and went\ndown into the town. About June last year, after mature consideration, I\ncame to believe that there was evidence enough to grant the possibility of\nspirit phenomena. Since then 1 have had several most vivid returns of similar\n\fiv.] Hallucinations and Pseudo-Hallucinations. 87\nexperiences, one when out for a walk, the rest being in my rooms at brief\nintervals, and always this woman. Why do I say it is a woman 1 And yet\nIfoiotc it is ; I do not believe, I huno\u2014always when not thinking about it.\nThe last was after a card party in my rooms. I was rather irritated at the\ntime, and I am afraid said very sharply, \" Oh go to the ! \" Whether\nthis adjuration was entirely efficacious remains to be proved, but the feeling\nof the presence suddenly ceased. If it was a spirit, she did not even give\nme an opportunity foran apology.\n\" About a week after this\u2014I cannot ascertain at this moment the exact\ndate\u2014I was in the Assembly Rooms, directly opposite the gates, listening to\nArthur Helmore in some of his sketches. I suddenly became seized with\nthe idea that an old man in last century costume was present on\nthe stage, and he gradually passed through the wings. I could have stood at\nan easel and painted it, yet I did not see him. This was the most vivid\nof all.\n\" I am often conscious of presences, though sometimes very vague, some\ntimes in the air, sometimes walking about, very seldom standing still. In\nevery case my attention is called\u2014shall I say, by the magnetic influence ? I\nnever fancy there is something, and then believe there is a visitor. My first\nexperience of [these] sensations was in 1887. All were out of the house but\nmyself, even servants. I was cataloguing my late father's library. I distinctly\nheard the front door open, some one come down the hall, go upstairs. I went\nto the door of the room, expecting to see some one going upstairs ; there\nwas no one there, and the front door was bolted. It was the spring race\nmeeting in the town. I thought that possibly some one might have walked\nin. I went upstairs\u2014no one there ! During the writing of this, I have been\nconscious of a draped figure coming in at the door and making a circle round\nthe room and disappearing behind my back. Its colour was a delicate raw\number, almost the tone, but not the shade, of the ground of a plover's egg.\n\" I am healthy, and take an enormous amount of exercise, and am con\nsidered an exceptionally strong man. I cannot put it down to hallucination,\nand yet how is it that I should know the colours 1 I have stood in my room\nand called upon them to appear, and they would not favour me. I once\nwalked up to one, or rather tried to, and it backed through an india-\nrubber plant, through an engraving of Sir. F. Leighton's \"Solitude,\" and\nthe wall\u2014and yet I did not see it.\"\nIn this case, we see the experience in various forms, from the mere\nsense of presence, unaccompanied by distinct sensory impressions or\nimages, and not very definitely localised in space, to the figure occupy\ning a perfectly definite place in the real surroundings, and whose form\nand colour is clearly apprehended by visual images, which, however,\nwere not externalised. It is important to notice that Mr. H. is a good\njudge of this, as he has experienced a complete visual hallucination\nas well, and can compare them. Compare with this a case quoted in\nProceedings, S.P.R.. Vol. VI., p. 53, where, however, the impression\nwas dispelled by looking at the place where the figure was supposed to\nbe seated.\n\f88 [chap.\nReport on the Census of Hallucinations.\nVisual hallucinations which are undoubtedly fully externalised are\nsometimes complicated by a non-externalised element. Thus, Mrs.\nVerrall in her experiments in crystal vision (see Proceedings, S.P.R.,\nVol. VIII., p. 474) is sometimes aware that certain objects in the\nvision have certain colours, while conscious of not seeing the colour.\nAuditory pseudo-hallucinations\u2014sometimes described as the hear\ning of inner voices, which seem to be heard by the mind, and not by\nthe ear\u2014are not uncommon experiences with some persons. A striking\ninstance is given in Phantasms of the Living (Vol. I., p. 481, footnote).\nSome of these auditory cases, like some of the visual ones, seem to be\non the verge of externalisation, and the percipient himself cannot\nalways say whether they are externalised or not. Occasionally, even\nin cases that seem externalised, there is some quality that differentiates\nthem from real external sounds.\nThus one percipient, Mrs. G., (682. 5.) writes:\u2014\n\"The hallucination consisted in hearing myself being called by name, so\ndistinctly that I have looked around to hear whom the sound came from ;\nthough, whether from imagination or the remembrance of this having\noccurred before, the voice, if I may call it so, had a quite indefinable quality,\nwhich invariably startled me and separated it from any ordinary sound.\nThis lasted for several years. I am quite unable to explain the circum\nstances, or that which impressed them upon me after ' the voice ' ceased.\"\nIt occasionally happens that a visual hallucination is associated with\nan auditory pseudo-hallucination ; a completely externalised apparition\nseeming to communicate something in words which the percipient\napprehends, but without seeming to hear them. We have no case\nof the converse kind\u2014i.e., of a voice heard and felt to proceed from a\npseudo-hallucinatory apparition.\n[The following account, which was received independently of the Census,\nis taken from notes made by a member of the Committee during an interview\nwith the percipient, Miss G., who having almost lost her eyesight, was unable\nto write it herself. She has had several other visual hallucinations.}\nDecember 20th, 1891.\n\" Miss G. had once living with her as lady companion a Mrs. V., who\ndied of consumption in a home at Bournemouth on Nov. 25, 1888. Mrs. V.'s\ntwo children, who had died before her, were buried in the Norwood\nCemetery, and Miss G. had promised that, if she went to the cemetery, she\nwould look at their graves and see that they were in good condition. On\nMonday, May 11th, 1891, she had an opportunity of going to the cemetery\nin the morning, and found the graves well kept, as it turned out that a re\nlative of Mrs. V.'s had looked after them ; so she felt no more responsibility\nabout them, and thought no more about them. She came home to luncheon,\nand afterwards her cousin Miss B. was reading aloud to her, when she\nsuddenly saw Mrs. V. standing against a dark part of the wall, about 10 feet\nfrom her, in a black serge dress, dark blue cloth jacket, like one Mrs. V.\n\fIV.] 89\nHallucinations and Pseudo-Hallucinations.\nhad made herself, a bat which she was familiar with, and tan gloves, like\nsome Mrs. V. had once bought, but with plain silk stripes on the back,\ninstead of little tufts which the original gloves had had. Miss Q. recognised\ndefinitely all these articles of dress and looked up at the figure, expecting\nit to speak. She heard the words, \" Thank you for going to see my babies.\"\nThe voice seemed to come from the figure and was distinctly recognised by\nMiss G. as Mrs. V.'s voice, but yet it was not exactly audible like a real\nsound, so that she would not have expected another person to hear it,\u2014she\nthought, because the lips of the figure did not move. On the other hand,\nthe figure itself was so clearly visible that she did expect her cousin to\nsee it, but she did not. It was perfectly natural and life-like\u2014with sunny\nhair and bright colour like a consumptive person ; the right hand was\ncrossed over the left, the figure was tall and broad. Mrs. V. had been\na rather striking-looking person. The attitude of the hands was charac\nteristic.\n\"At this time Miss G. was nearly blind, but could see the apparition quite\nas clearly as a rather short-sighted person would ever have seen a real person\nat that distance, viz., about 10 feet.\"\nAn instance where the idea of the tactile and muscular sense comes\nsimilarly into play in a pseudo-hallucinatory manner, without actual\nsensation, and yet with a spontaneity and insistance quite unusual in\nimagined sensations, is the following :\u2014\n(446. 25.) From Mrs. W.\n(The account was written in 1891.)\n\" A few years ago I received a letter from one of my sons, who was seeing\nAmerica for the first tune on his way to the Rocky Mountains. Amongst\nother things he described his visit to Niagara. It had evidently impressed\nhim with the greatest admiration and delight, so that he could hardly tear\nhimself away from the position he had taken above the Falls. His\ndescription was not minute, but the few words he did say were very expressive,\nso that I seemed to know a little what it was like, and what it was like to\nhim as he stood there. I generally read my children's letters two or three\ntimes, and I am almost sure that it was not at my first reading of this\nletter, but at a second reading of it in the afternoon, and certainly in a room\nby myself, that I found myself experiencing a very extraordinary sensation\nof what I suppose I should have felt if I had been with my son at Niagara,\nand of what I suppose he felt. It was not seeing or hearing, not even\nfeeling the spray as if actually wetting my face, but I should describe the\nsensation as the half-exhausting and yet delightful exhilaration and\nbreathlesmess produced by high wind and dashing water. I had made no\neffort to realise so completely what my son had seen and felt. The sensation\ndistinctly came to me, and was such a very palpable impalpability that I stood\nor sat quite still, recipient of this strange effect, anxious to lose none of it.\n\" I do not remember the actual effect upon me of any fine waterfall, not\nhaving seen any for a great many years, and never any very remarkable\none, so that the effect of the dash and grandeur of a high sea is the nearest\n\f90 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nlikeness I know to what I felt on this occasion. I stood still in fear of\nlosing any of the strange visitation, until it began to lose power and to\nbecome only a faint effect, and then ceased, either because it had exhausted\nitself or because my receiving power was exhausted.\n\" Then I moved across the room, and I remember trying whether I could\nrevive the effect\u2014make it return\u2014having the lately-read letter with me all\nthe time, no doubt. But, to measure the power of the feeling in the form\nin which my mind's eye has clothed it ever since (and no doubt did at the\ntime), what had been an airy, cloudy column of force a foot and more\nhigh, would now only rise half a foot or less, then sink, then be renewed at\nmy desire, only in smaller height (so my imagination described to me the\nlesser degree), then in smaller still, I suppose (though this third degree\nI cannot distinctly recall), and then no more, or I gave up the attempt.\nI felt no sensation of spray dashed up upon me, and actually wetting me,\nbut all that was not palpable of it I felt. I was not made actually breath\nless, but had the sensation of it, without the actual thing.\"\nWe will conclude this section with two cases, included in our Tables,\nwhich seem to be on the line between hallucinations and pseudo-\nhallucinations. The first we are disposed to regard as a pseudo-hallu\ncination at the outset, turning into a fully externalised, though\nmomentary, hallucination of the ordinary type at the end.\n(584. 24.) 1 From Miss S.\nJanuary 22nd, 1892.\n\"Six years ago at Gibraltar, when standing washing her hands in dressing-\nroom at A, with her back to C, Miss S.\n' saw with her eyes ' (she knows this\nwas impossible because of the wall on\neither side of C, but she can only\ndescribe it that way) a friend of hers,\nthen living in the West of Scotland,\nwalk in at the door B, having a strange\nset smile on his face, and walk across\nthe room, and stand in doorway C. She then turned round and looked at\nhim. She had only a glimpse of him after turning round, and then he\nvanished. She learned afterwards that he had died at that hour on that\nday. She mentioned what she had seen to no one beforehand. She was in\nvery good health at the time. \"\nThe difficulty in classifying the earlier part of this experience lies\nin the expression \" saw with her eyes,\" since this quality of seeming to\nbe seen with the bodily eyes is precisely the quality which is lacking in\n1 This case is strictly speaking at second-hand, but the collector is very well known\nto us, has been a collaborator in various departments of Psychical Research work,\nand is known by us to be careful and accurate, and acquainted with the questions at\nissue.

We are disposed, however, to think, notwith\nstanding this expression, that the first part of the experience was not\nan apparent sense-perception, since, if the percipient really felt as\nthough she saw the figure with her eyes, why did she turn round to\nlook at it I1\nThe next case is a vision of great vividness, but it is somewhat\ndifficult, at any rate in retrospect, to say whether it appeared to be\nseen with the bodily eyes.\n(38. 24.) From Mr. A. D.\nAugust 8lh, 1889.\n\"The details of the illusion are very simple. I was lying in bed, on a\nSunday morning in November, 1876, quite awake and as well as usual at\nthat time. The door between the bedroom and the keeping-room was shut,\nand the position in which I was lying would have made it impossible to see\nanything in the adjoining room, even had the door been open. Suddenly\nI saw on the table there a row of letters, laid one below the other, so as to\nleave the addresses and the stamps in sight. Their exact number I have\nforgotten, and it is of no consequence. The handwriting on the envelopes\nwas in each case unknown to me, but the post-marks, which were all un\nusually distinct\u2014as clear as the Bath stamp, if you have ever noticed that\u2014\nall bore the names of places where the few relations I have were then living,\nand at once I knew that the letters contained the news of their death. For\nsome time I lay there thinking, not in the dreamy and half-conscious state\nwhich sometimes comes from a sudden shock, but with a full and vivid sense\nof what had happened and of the difference which it would make in my life.\nAt last, with a great effort, 1 got up, determined to read the details and to\nknow the worst. I dressed first, and then went into the next room to get\nthe letters. I cannot describe the effect of going to the table and finding\nnothing except the breakfast things. There was no feeling of relief ; it\nseemed as if some violent convulsion were tearing one's whole structure in\npieces, and for some minutes after that I can remember nothing. Even\nthen the illusion did not pass away. All that day I waited in suspense for\nthe letters of the next day, expecting the news to come then ; and with the\nforce gradually failing, the same idea lasted on through the week, till at last\nit passed into a shadow and vanished away.\n\"The vividness of the thing you will best understand from this\u2014that\n1 have entirely forgotten the size and shape of the rooms, the arrangement\nof the furniture, and all the other details connected with them, except so\nfar as they relate to this one incident. Where the bookcases were placed, and\nthe position of the couch and the easy chairs, I could not tell, but the bed,\nthe door between the rooms, and the table, I could mark down to an inch.\"\nMr. D. adds, in answer to questions :\u2014\n\" I was certainly awake, and with my eyes open, when the vision\noccurred. Looking back, it is impossible to say whether there was any\nconsciousness of what was really before me, but my impression is that\n1 Compare a case in Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. III., p. 114.\n\f92 [chap.\nEeport on the Census of Halluxsvnations.\nfor the moment everything but the sight of the table and the letters was\nabsolutely wiped out.\"\nVisualising.\nIt seems appropriate to consider in connection with the question\nof externalisation, whether there is any relation between visualising\npower and hallucination. The power of visualising\u2014that is, calling\nup vivid and distinct mental images of objects thought of\u2014varies\ngreatly with different individuals, as we know from Mr. Galton's\ninvestigations. (Enquiries into Human Faculty, pp. 83-114.)\nMM. Binet and F6r6 ascertained (Animal Magnetism, p. 221)\nthat most of the persons with whom they tried experiments in\nhypnotically induced hallucinations were, in the waking state, good\nvisualisers, and they believe that persons who have the power of\nvisualising are more susceptible of visual hallucinations than others.\nThe two things, however, do not necessarily go together. One of\nthe ladies whose crystal-seeing experiments Mr. Myers gives in\nProceedings, S.P.R., Vol. VIII., p. 499.\u2014Miss A.\u2014who, moreover,\nhas frequently spontaneous visual hallucinations as well as those\nshe induces in the crystal, tells us that she is not a good visualiser ;\nand many good visualisers do not see hallucinations. We should\nhave liked to ascertain what proportion of the persons who have\nreported visual hallucinations to us are good visualisers ; but\nthe question seemed scarcely simple enough to put indiscriminately and\nwithout oral explanation to those who had not thought of it before ;\nand we were, moreover, afraid of its increasing the trouble already im\nposed on our informants, so that we have not attempted any statistical\ninquiry on the subject. The accounts, however, which we have\nreceived from some of our informants lead us to conclude that the\npower varies considerably, not only in different individuals, but in the\nsame individual at different times. It has been especially noticed by\nsome persons that they have it in a much greater degree just before\ngoing to sleep, and in the condition between sleeping and waking.\nMr. Galton gives two instances of this from bad visualisers. (Op. ext.,\np. 91.) The following communications have been received by ourselves\non the subject.\nNovember 28th, 1891.\n\"Dear Mr. Myers,\u2014Since hearing your paper on the Subliminal Self, I\nhave been making observations, as you suggested one should, on my power\nof visualising just before going to sleep, and I find that at this time the\npower is extraordinarily increased, so that scenes which at ordinary times\npresent themselves to me in fragments appear as if they were really before\nme ; I Was myself quite surprised at the result.\n\fiv.] Hallucinations and Pseudo-Hallucinatiom. 93\n\" When falling asleep, and especially when dozing in a chair, my\nvisualising powers are raised above their normal level. Visualised scenes,\nof the nature of dreams, but partly under control, take the place of what is\ngoing on in the room, or mix themselves up with it.\n\" H. Babikoton Smith.\"\nMrs. H. Sidgwick writes :\u2014\n\"My ordinary visual mental images are extremely vague. They exist,\u2014it\nis, for instance, often by a vague visual impression of its place in a shelf\nthat I can find a book,\u2014but they are fragmentary and indefinite. I cannot\nrecall clearly the faces most familiar to me. Occasionally, however, when\nhalf asleep, I have a flash of good visualisation. I remember one occasion.\nI was half asleep and had before me the usual vague kind of image of a\nnumber of persons, and, among them, one whose aspect I was very familiar\nwith ; when suddenly, and for a brief moment, this person's image came to my\nmental vision in a perfectly distinct and definite form, as clear and detailed\nas if he had been actually before me in the flesh, and altogether different\nfrom the previous vague image of him. This instance was more or less in\nvoluntary, and verges, therefore, I suppose, on a pseudo-hallucination ; but\nI also am sometimes able when half asleep to call up, voluntarily, clearer\nvisual images than my ordinary waking ones.\"\nThis increase of visualising power under conditions known to be\nfavourable to pseudo-hallucinations looks as if the two things were\nrelated, at least to some extent, but it would not necessarily follow\nthat genuine hallucinations were also related to general visualising\npower.\n\f94 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nChapter V.\nTHE RELATION OF ILLUSIONS TO HALLUCINATIONS.\nIn the last chapter we had to distinguish between hallucinations\nand non-externalised mental images. In this we have to deal with\nthe limits of the class of hallucinations on the other side, and to\ndiscuss those cases where the doubt is not as to externalisation,\nbut as to whether what is experienced is not merely an illusion, in\nwhich some real object is perceived, but misinterpreted as something\nelse.1\nThe following are good instances of well-observed illusions. As\nsuch they would, of course, be excluded from our statistics.\n(703. 5.) From Professor W. R. Sorley.\nCardiff, .My 29th, 1891.\n\" Lying in bed, facing the window, and opening my eyes voluntarily in\norder to drive away the imagery of an unpleasant dream which was begin\nning to revive, I saw the figure of a man, some three or four feet distant\nfrom my head, standing perfectly still by the bedstead, so close to it that\nthe bedclothes seemed slightly pushed towards me by his leg pressing\nagainst them. The image was perfectly distinct\u2014height about five feet\neight inches, sallow complexion, grey eyes, greyish moustache, short and\nbristly, and apparently recently clipped. His dress seemed like a dark grey\ndressing-gown, tied with a dark red rope.\n\"My first thought was, 'That's a ghost' ; my second, 'It may be a\nburglar whose designs upon my watch are interrupted by my opening my\neyes.' I bent forward towards him, and the image vanished.\n1 There is an experience with which we are all familiar, which is not an illusion\nin exactly the same sense as the above, since it involves no erroneous inference from\nwhat is seen, but which is instructive in considering the process involved in such\nillusions. The experience we mean U the interpretation of a pattern in either of two\ndifferent ways at will, as when we see a rose on a wall paper, either as a face ora rose, as\nwechoose. The most striking examples are the drawings in black and white, which have\nbeen a good deal sold of late years, which are so drawn as to represent two distinct\nthings at the sametime ; for instance, one drawing may be either seen as a half-length\npicture of a coquettish looking young woman, or as the head of a cross old crone.\nHaving seen the picture in one way, it is often only by a considerable effort that we\ncan interpret it in its other equally real meaning, and then it is only by a similar\neffort that we can return to the first view.\nWhen one of the interpretations is unreal, or unintended, as is, of course, the\ncase when we are concerned with the ordinary objects or patterns surrounding us,\nit may vary with the condition of our eyesight, or other circumstances. A friend of\nours informs us that on one occasion, when lying in bed unwell, and with\ntemperature somewhat above the normal, the patterns on his wall paper, the folds of\nhis curtains, 4c, made themselves up into numerous very definite and quite per\nsistent figures, which he was quite unable to reproduce when his illness was over.\nThe following is a curious experience apparently of this character, in which the\n\fv.] Relation of Illusions to Hallucinations. 95\n\" As the image vanished, my attention passed to a shadow on the wall,\ntwice or three times the distance off, and perhaps twelve feet high. There\nwas a gas lamp in the mews-lane outside, which shed a light through the\nlower twelve inches or so of the (first-floor) window, over which the blind\nhad not been completely drawn, and the shadow was cast by the curtain\nhanging beside the window. The solitary bit of colour in the image\u2014the\nred rope of the dressing-gown\u2014was immediately afterwards identified with\nthe twisted mahogany handle of the dressing-table, which was in the same\nline of vision as part of the shadow.\n\"Place : 51 (?), Torrington-square, London, W.C. Time : About the\nend of November (?), 1886, probably 2 a.m.\n\"I had just had an unpleasant dream (quite unconnected with the\nimage), and, on awaking, had turned round to lie on the other side, thus\nfacing the window.\n\" If my recollection serves me rightly, I had that evening been discussing\napparitions and illusions with Professor Croom Robertson and Mr. Carveth\nRead. Age 31.\n' ' I wondered very much afterwards that I had not identified the image\nwith my brother, who is about the same general build and height, and wears\na short moustache, which he sometimes clips. Probably the identification\nwas prevented by the burglar-scare occurring to me. I did not think at the\ntime of any one in connection with the image.\n\" W. R. Sorijsy.\"\nFrom Miss W.\n\" One evening at dusk I went into my bedroom to fetch something I\nwanted off the mantelpiece. A street lamp threw a slanting ray of light\nin at the window, just sufficient to enable me to discern the dim outline of\nthe chief articles of furniture in the room. I was cautiously feeling for\nwhat I wanted when, partially turning round, I perceived at a short distance\nbehind me the figure of a little old lady, sitting very sedately with her hands\ninfluence causing the illusion is regarded by the percipient as telepathic. It reached\nus independently of the Census. Mrs. W. writes :\u2014\n\"In 1873 we were moved to Montsioa's country, my husband having been\nappointed missionary to that chief. Our home was at Ma6king. My two eldest\ngirls, Eva and Jeseie, seven and nine years of age, were in Grahamstown at school.\nWhile travelling to the chief's great place in July\u2014we were having breakfast\u2014as I\nlooked at my little Celia instead of seeing Celia's face, I saw my Jessie's face quite\nplainly, and wondered at the time, because the children did not resemble each other,\nand I had not seen Jessie since August, 1872. We all went to chapel, and each time\nI looked at Celia, I saw Jessie's face. I remarked to my husband how strange it was ;\nhe replied, ' And they are not alike, are they ? ' And so on at intervals during all\nthe four days' journey. I felt troubled about it, for we were so far from any post,\nand from my dear child. She seemed somehow to be near me. I began to wonder\nwhy no letters came. After a while I did not see her face so plainly, but always\nwhen I looked at Celia, this continued at intervals, far into August. In September\nwe got letters from Grahamstown telling us how dangerously ill Jessie had been,\nfor days hovering between life and death ; how they would not write until they knew\nwhatit was to be, life or death ; then they told of restoration to health. Then I said\nto my husband, ' That accounts for the strange feelings I have had about Jessie, and\nseeing her so often before me.' I was always wide awake, no dreams of the night.\nIt is now nearly 19 years ago.\n\f96 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nfolded in her lap, holding a white pocket-handkerchief. I was much startled,\nfor I had not before seen anyone in the room, and called out ' Who's that?'\nbut received no answer, and, turning quite round to face my visitor, she\nimmediately vanished from sight. ' Well,' I thought, ' this is strange ! '\nI had left all the rest of the household downstairs ; it was hardly possible\nthat anyone could have followed me into the room without my being aware\nof it, and besides, the old lady was quite different from anyone I had ever\nseen. Being very near-sighted, I began to think my eyes had played me a\ntrick ; so I resumed my search in as nearly as possible the same position as\nbefore, and having succeeded, was turning to come away when lo ! and\nbehold ! there sat the little old lady as distinct as ever, with her funny little\ncap, dark dress, and hands folded demurely over her white handkerchief.\nThis time I turned round quickly and marched up to the apparition, which\nvanished as suddenly as before. And now being convinced that no one was\nplaying me any trick, I determined to find out, if possible, the why and\nbecause of the mystery. Slowly resuming my former position by the fire\nplace, and again perceiving the figure, I moved my head slightly from side to\nside, and found that it did the same. I then went slowly backwards, keeping\nmy head still until I again reached the place, when deliberately turning\nround the mystery was solved.\n\"A small, polished, mahogany stand near the window, which I used as a\ncupboard for various trifles, made the body of the figure, a piece of paper\nhanging from the partly-open door serving as the handkerchief ; a vase on\nthe top formed the head and head dress, and the slanting light falling upon\nit, and the white curtain of the window completed the illusion. I destroyed\nand re-made the figure several times, and was surprised to find how distinct\nit appeared when the exact relative positions were maintained.\"\nWith less good observers, or less favourable circumstances for\nobservation, it is clear that these illusions might never have been re\nsolved into their constituent elements and might have been permanently\ntaken for hallucinations. It is, therefore, not improbable that some\nof the cases reported to us as hallucinations were really illusions, and,\nthis being so, it becomes important to consider under what conditions\nthe mistake is likely to occur.\nImperfect vision of the object misinterpreted is the general condi\ntion of such experiences, and this may occur (a) owing to the light\nbeing bad, as in the cases we have quoted ; or, (6) owing to defects of\nthe eyes, such as astigmatism and short sight. For instance, a short\nsighted friend of ours tells us that she has several times mistaken a cer\ntain projecting corner of a rough stone wall for a lady with flounced\nskirts. The following account also illustrates the effect of short-sight,\nand gives a probable explanation of some curious auditory illusions.\n(251. 1.) From Miss S. H.\nNovember 28th, 1889.\n' ' I consider the whole class of this kind of mental phenomena to be of\nthe nature of dreaming. I am constitutionally a regular and sound sleeper.\n\fRelation of Illusions to Hallucinations. !)7\nBut any occurring disturbance in health, either of body or mind, occasions\ndreams ; besides which I am aware of an intermediate state between torpor\nand full activity of functions, which is apt often to run into the semi-\ndreaming which retains consciousness of being such. And this midway\nstate grows upon me with age. It chiefly concerns annuls, while for some\nlittle time past I have been tending towards deafness ; but it also respects\npartially my sense of siijht. while I have known myself from early youth to\nbe short-sighted. I should not know my own sister by her features across a\nroom, judging people generally by their dress and mode of walking. Iam,\nhowever, very imaginative, and it often happens to me, now that we two are\nliving alone together, either to see her seated in a corner of our sitting-\nroom as I enter it, when she Ls no< there, or to miss seeing her when she is\nthere. But I am much more affected as to sounds. We have lived at two\nhouses in C , first at B , and now at the Cottage ; while near to both,\nbut almost close to the latter, runs the N line of railway, and many\nhave been the startling dreams that its night-trains have wakened me up\ninto, especially if I have been weak in health. This began when at B . I\nwas confined to bed with bronchitis. I noticed time after time that my\nsister seemed to run hastily from her bedroom straight into her dressing-\nroom, on the other side of the wall against which my own bed was placed,\nstop at her toilet stand, to fetch, as I supposed, some medicine or something\nwanted by her husband, and then return to him as hastily. After several\nrepetitions, I mentioned it to her ; she denied having done anything of the\nkind, and said, ' Of course it was the train.' I did not at once see a corre\nspondence to my experience, and knew not how to accept her explanation,\ntill I came to remember the bridge that crosses the road passed by the train.\nHere was actually the sufficing cause for the midway stoppage, and the\nadvancing and retreating rushes which afforded the noticed perspective of\nsound. But since we have lived at the Cottage we lose the effect of the\nbridge, and have only the sudden bursting one, and then the retreating\nrush. Soon after our removal, I remember in particular being onoe\nstartled up. and supposing that a man was running in a violent passion\nof anger along the passage behind my bed. Recently, my sound-delusions\nattach [themselves] to many sorts of common movements ; any stir of\nfurniture or blast of wind supplies to itself suggested words. I will now\nrepeat and analyse [one] special instance of this semi-dreaming as to which I\nbelieve I can safely trust my memory.\n\"[It] was at B\u2014\u2014. at a tune when my bedroom was on an upper\nstory, just over that of Mr. and Mrs. B. In the darkness of early\nmorning I was suddenly roused by what seemed to me a voice calling,\n' S I ' I jumped out of bed, and leaned over the banister on the\nlanding, crying out, ' What is it ? do you want me ? ' and even ran down and\nopened the bedroom door of my sister, asking the same question. 'No,'\nthey had not called me, and sent me back to bed. And as I lay there I\nreflected how inevitably, if I had been superstitious, I should have taken it\nfor granted that the voice heard was one of warning from my mother, who\nhad died some time before. But it turned out that Mr. B. had that morn\ning risen to draw up his window-blind, that he might be able to read in bed\n*hen the dawn should come. It must have been that blind's drawing-up\nwhich I heard call to me ' S '. \"\nii\n\f98 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nAgain, (c) the imperfect vision may be owing to the distance of\nthe object seen. Of course, distance may easily lead to a mistake of\nidentity, but this is almost too obvious to need saying, and a percipient\nwould seldom rest his belief that he had seen a hallucination merely on\nthe fact that he thought he saw a friend who could not have been in\nthe place, unless the distance was small enough to make any question\nas to distinctness of vision seem absurd. But there is another way in\nwhich illusions may arise from distance : a figure may disappear in a\nmanner that seems quite unaccountable, when it has really only been\nhidden by some object whose exact relative position is not apprehended.\nWe have no instance of an illusion proved to have arisen in this way,\nbut the following case, in which one precipient is sure that the experi\nence can be thus explained, and the other percipient is equally sure\nthat it cannot, will serve well to illustrate the point.\n(56. 18.) From Miss E. R. B.\n(The account was written in 1889.)\n\" On a summer evening in daylight, in or about the year 1867, I was\nwalking with my father and sister between the North and South Cam]),\nAldershot, on a sandy, open space. Behind us we heard footsteps, and\nlooking back saw a soldier, who followed us some few yards, when we missed\nhim, and turning could not see him, so went back to look for him, but he\nwas nowhere to be seen.\n\" I was out for a walk, in my usual health and spirits.\n\" Personally the soldier was quite unknown.\n\" My companions were my father and sister ; both saw what I did. I\nam unable to say whether the former had any fixed opinion about it. The\nlatter has always thought it a real soldier that somehow got away.\"\n[In this case we have allowed the view of the more sceptical sister to\nprevail, and have not included the case in our tables.]\nErrors from this cause\u2014vision imperfect owing to distance\u2014are\nmore likely to occur when the percipient is out of doors than under\nother circumstances, both because persons are then liable to be seen at\ngreater distances than they can be indoors, and because possible inter\nvening obstacles are liable to be less known and familiar, as well as\nmore distant.\nA fourth kind of imperfect vision (d) is due to the object seen\nbeing in the outer part of the field of sight. We have probably all\nof us at times imagined that we saw some person or thing out of the\ncorner of our eye, which, on turning round, we found not to be there.\nWhen a supposed hallucination is thus seen out of the corner of the\neye, it is generally felt to be a trivial and unimpressive experience,\nand this, combined with frequent doubt on our informant's part as to\nwhether the experience was a hallucination or an illusion, has, we\n\fv.] Relation of Illusions to Hallucinations. 99\nbelieve, led to very imperfect returns under this head. For this\nreason we have, as explained in Chapter II., p. 37, left out of our\ntables all supposed hallucinations seen out of the corner of the eye.\nIt is not easy to estimate the extent to which the other three\ncauses of indistinct vision may have led to permanent errors. Probably\nthe second\u2014defective eyesight\u2014is the least important by itself, as\nthose who suffer from it are in the habit of mistrusting and correcting\ntheir impressions, and, moreover, they correct the defects as far as\npossible with glasses. Defective eyesight would, however, sometimes\nenhance the drawbacks of feeble light.\nIllusions seem to be relatively frequent just after waking from sleep.\nThe small amount of light which there often is in the room under these\ncircumstances would, of course, largely account for this, but other\ncauses may also operate, such as the want of rapid adjustment of\nthe eyes immediately after waking and the want of complete alertness\nof the judgment. To these would be added for short-sighted people\nthe absence of spectacles ; and for persons in general there would often\nbe the loss of the important aid in judging of distance and solidity\nwhich is given by binocular vision, since, when a person lies on one\nside, one eye is apt to be buried in the pillow.\nOn the whole, it is obvious that poor light may be a very fruitful\nsource of error, and though unmistakable hallucinations do of course\nsometimes occur in bad light, (as for instance No. 192. 21, p. 139),\nall alleged hallucinations occurring under these circumstances should\nhave their credentials examined with especial care. We cannot say\nthat this examination leaves by any means all those included in our\ntables free from suspicion. The following case, for instance, seems a\nsomewhat doubtful one, especially as the percipient's expectation of\nseeing his brother would naturally predispose him to a particular\ninterpretation of what he saw.\n(145. 9.) From Mr. G. M. C.\n(The account was written in 1892.)\n\"In rooms of , Cambridge, on entering room expecting to meet\na brother, [I] saw him distinctly leaning against mantelpiece, the time\nabout 10 in the evening, in April, '89, the room only lighted by a fire. On\nlooking more closely he was not there. [I was] just entering room. [Age]\nabout 19. No [other persons were present.]\n\" I was expecting to see him, and was surprised not to find him.\"\nIt appeared to us, however, that it would be useless to attempt\na numerical estimate of the probable amount of error in our tables due\nto this cause, without a more accurate knowledge than we could hope\nto obtain of the exact circumstances of each case, and of the capacity\nof our informants as observers. But, after carefully considering the\nh 2\n\f100 Report on the Census of Hallucination*!. [chap.\nreports sent to us, we have come to the conclusion that, in about\nninety per cent. of the visual cases,\u2014certainly not less\u2014the circum\nstances reported afford no ground for the supposition that a real person\nor thing was mistaken for a hallucination. The proportion of cases\nopen to doubt is, as already stated in Chapter III. (p. 65), consider\nably larger among the more recent cases than among the remoter ones.\nThere is a small class of apparitions in which the repeated reappear\nance of the same figure in the same place, as seen from the same point\nof view, like the illusion described on pp. 95-6, strongly suggests\nthat some real effect of light and shade, or some real object, is con\ntinually misinterpreted in the same way, and that there is no genuine\nhallucination. The following is a case in point.\n(196. 2.) From Miss H. M.\n(The account was written in 1889.)\n\"I think it was about two years ago, in the winter, at about 6.30 or\nperhaps earlier, but it was too dark to distinguish anything clearly. I was\ncoming up a steep lonely bit of road about 300 yards from our own house,\nand I saw just ahead of me what looked like a person in some light clothes ;\nit looked like a man in a smock-frock, and though it was too dark to dis\ntinguish details, the figure was distinctly light against the hedge on the side\nof the road. I watched the figure walking up in front of me, but thought\nit nothing at all strange, until at a slight bend in the road it entirely dis\nappeared, though I looked all about for it. I was driving with my sister in\na pony dog-cart ; either she or I was driving, I don't remember which, but\nwe were going only at a foot's pace.\n\" It was too dark to see anything but that it was a human figure moving\nup the hill, and keeping at about the same distance from us. I concluded it\nwas a farm labourer, partly because this would be most probable, and partly\nbecause the upper part of the figure was lighter than the lower part, which\ngave the impression of its wearing a smock-frock.\n\" My sister was with me and saw the figure also. We knew the road\nwas said to be haunted, but we are so accustomed to this bit of road at all\nhours that this fact was not at all in our minds. The figure looked so\nabsolutely natural, that I was much surprised at its disappearance.\n\"This is the only time I have had this experience, though I have often\ncome up the road in the dark since, and have always looked out for the\nfigure.\"\nThe other percipient, Miss M. M., writes :\u2014\nMarch 8th, 1892.\n\" One night I was driving home with my sister in a small pony cart, and\nI saw walking up the hill in front of us what looked like a man in a smock-\nfrock ; quite suddenly he vanished, and I thought it rather odd and that\nwhat I had seen could not have really been a man. I then found my sister\nhad also seen the figure, and that she had the same feeling about its being\nmysterious.\n\" We were further puzzled by hearing that my father and brother had also\nseen the figure, and that he always vanished about the same place.\n\fRelation of Illusions to Hallucinations, 101\n\"I cannot remember who saw him first, and I have never seen him again.\"\nBesides the above, we have accounts from Mr. M and his son,\nwho have also seen on different occasions, twice each, a figure which\nthey describe as like a man in a smock-frock, in the same place, at night,\nunder similar circumstances, disappearing in the same mysterious way.\nNeither of them had heard of the experiences of any of the others until\nafter his own.\nMrs. Sidgwick writes :\u2014\nFebruary 25<\/i, 1892.\n\"I have this evening talked over the apparition with Miss M. M\nand her father. He has seen it twice at least ; she once with Miss H.\nM , and her brother has recently seen it again. It is always seen in the\nsame place and disappears suddenly at the same place. Always seen in the\nevening, but it has not been observed whether it is always with the moon in\nthe same position, &c. The darkness has always been too great for distinct\nvision. It is difficult to suppose it a shadow because of the space over\nwhich it appears to move. But that it is some effect of light and shade is,\nthey think, considering its uniformly appearing and disappearing in the\nsame place and in a faint light, the most probable hypothesis.\n\" It seems likely that others may have seen it ; for once Miss M. M\u2014\u2014\nwas going up the hill in a pretty good light, following a farmer and his wife\nwell known to her. The farmer's wife looked round, caught sight of Miss\nM , and threw herself into her husband's arms,screaming as if with fright.\n\"I went over the ground of the ghost with Miss M . Certainly\nseeing the place does not explain it ; it is a rather open place\u2014hedges on\neach side and only a few hedgerow trees. The ghost walks about fifty yards\nin front of the percipients and continues visible for, say, one hundred\nyards, and then disappears near some farm buildings.\"\nThe first apparition described in the next case is even more de\ncidedly like the illusion of pp. 95-6. We have been unable to obtain\nfirst-hand evidence from the other percipients mentioned in this narra\ntive. The appearance of a similar figure on the second occasion may\nhave been due to expectancy, intensified by the general alarm of the\nhousehold.\n(588. 22.) From Miss F. Lewitt.\nThe Downs, St. Neots, February 2nd, 1892.\n\" The following story has this morning been told Miss C. Cochrane [the\ncollector] by her father's housemaid (lately come), a quiet, steady young\nwoman who came with a good character, and appears perfectly truthful.\nShe was quiet and thoughtful while telling the story (assisted by questions\nfrom Miss C.

Miss Cochrane then arranged the wording of the\nstory and read it to Fanny Lewitt, who said it was quite right, and then\nsigned it.\nFanny Lewitfs Story.\n\"In the month of December, 1889, I was living as nurse with Mr. and\nMrs. Bodley, at Alveston Hall, Nantwich, Cheshire. I was 25 years of age,\n\f102 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nand had been there three years, first as housemaid, then as nurse. I had\nnot heard anything about the house being haunted. One evening, shortly\nbefore Christmas, I was rocking the baby's cradle in the night-nursery at\nabout 9 p.m., while the family were at dinner. The night-nursery opened\ninto a passage with the school-room at the other end. The passage was\npartly lit by a lamp on the landing below. The night-nursery door was\nopen at the time, and at the end of the passage I observed a strange middle-\naged lady in white evening dress, with her side face towards me, standing\nagainst the school-room door, leaning her face on her hand. I watched her\nfor a moment, and then went out to see who it was and what she wanted,\nbut as I drew near she vanished away. I then went back to the baby, when\nthere was the lady standing as before ; I went out to her again, and again\nshe vanished. After repeating this a third time I felt frightened, and did\nnot look towards the door again, and I did not see the figure again that\nnight. When I went downstairs I told the other servants what I had seen,\nand the housemaid then said that the governess had been complaining that\nsome one always shook or opened her door when she was dressing for dinner,\nbut no one could be found who had done it. The next morning, early. just\nbefore getting up, the housemaid saw a middle-aged lady in short petticoats,\nwith something over her head, standing in the room. Two other maids slept\nin the room, but were not awake. The housemaid watched the apparition for\na few moments, and then hid her head under the bed-clothes. About this\ntime, the day before Christmas, the governess went away for her holidays,\nand the housemaid shut up her room and locked the door at night, but for\nseveral mornings afterwards, on going to unlock the door, she found it\nalready open. She then told her mistress, and Mr. Bodley himself locked\nthe door that night and put the key away, saying he would unlock it in the\nmorning ; but in the morning, when he went to do so, the door was open,\nand the key in the lock. The coachman was then put into the room to\nwatch all night, and he said next morning that he had seen nothing, but had\nheard loud noises, and the door shook and the crockery rattled. The day\nafter this, or the same evening (I forget which), at about 5.30 p.m., I again\nsaw the same strange lady standing in the passage in the same position, only\nthis time she was near the night-nursery door, and was wearing a morning\ngrey dress, her profile towards me. I was carrying some linen out into the\npassage, and fell back startled and frightened, when the figure disappeared.\nI told my mistress what I had again seen, and she was so frightened that\nthe whole family and myself left the house the next day, Sunday,\nJanuary the 1st. 1890, and the servants on Monday, and did not return to\nit again.\n\"Fanny Lewttt.\"\nNotwithstanding the possibility of regarding the apparitions in\nthe two cases last described as illusions, we have, on the whole,\nthought it right to reckon them as subjective cases of hallucination.1\nThe two following cases we included with somewhat less hesitation ;\n1 Some cases rather similar to these were (riven in the Journal of the S.P.R., Vol\nV., pp. 323-325.\n\fRelation of Illusions to Hallucinations. 103\nalthough in the first there is the same feature of recurrence at a\nparticular spot as seen from a particular point of view. But its\noccurrence in full daylight makes it comparatively unlikely that it was\na mere illusion\u2014especially as a similar condition of health in the\npercipient had been accompanied by a hallucination on a previous\noccasion.\n(460. 14.) From Professor G.\nFebruary llth, 1891.\n\" Saw an old woman with red cloak, nursing a child in her arms. She\nsat on a boulder. Place : a grassy moor or upland, near Shotts in Lanark\nshire. Date : over twenty years ago. Early autumn, in bright sunny\nweather. Made several attempts to reach her, but she always vanished\nbefore I could get close up to the stone. Place far from any dwelling, and\nno spot where anyone could be concealed.\n\"[I was] walking ; had been slightly troubled with insomnia\u2014which\nafterwards became much worse. Age about 30.\n\" No one [was with me]. I heard a vague report that a woman with red\ncloak was sometimes seen on the moor. Can't now remember whether I had\nheard of that report before I saw the figure\u2014but think I had not.\n' Saw many years ago (age about 21), a dog sitting beside me in my\nroom : saw this only once : was troubled slightly with insomnia at the\ntime, which became worse afterwards.\"\nThe percipient's own view, the collector tells us, is that the experience\non the moor was \"entirely due to 'nerves,' as both then and previously\nwhen he saw the dog, he had been much overworked, and in each case a\nsevere illness followed.\"\nIn the next case, the fact that the percipient could go close up to\nthe figure without its disappearing, makes it almost certain that,\nnotwithstanding its recurrence night after night in the same place, it\nwas a hallucination. An illusion would almost necessarily have been\ndispelled by so close an examination, and so complete a change in the\npoint of view.\n(643. 22.) From Mrs. Wilson, Westal, Cheltenham.\nApril 29th, 1892.\n\" I saw the figure of a ghost-like transparent draped woman always\nstanding at a certain spot on a landing near my room at night when I\npassed. The apparition was exactly like a certain ghost described to me by\na teller of ghost-stories. The tale was told me the night one of my babies\nwas at death's door.\n' ' [I was] nursing an infant of six months, and sitting up for three weeks,\nin turns with my husband, with another child of 16 months, who was hope\nlessly ill. Health good . Age 35.\n\" It was merely the form told of in the ghastly story, blue, transparent,\nstatuesque.\n\f104, Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\n\" I was ashamed of my weakness and spoke little of it ; it stood\nto meet me as I came out of my room, going up stairs, at any hour of\nthe night, to nurse the baby. I never asked anyone to come and look\nat it. I often went up to it and put my hand through it, which assured\nme of its being merely brought [on] by my unstrung nerves, sorrow,\nand fatigue.\n\" I often think of it now as I pass, and remember the horror of it\nmerely as a memory ; it worried me for some weeks\u2014five or six.\n\" Mary A. Wilson.\"\nThis experience is no doubt attributable to the mental and physical\nstrain under which the percipient was living, and its recurrence1 in\nthe particular spot would be accounted for by association of ideas\nand expectancy.\nAnother case of what was probably a hallucination, recurring in\nthe same spot, will be found in Appendix D, in the course of an\ninteresting hallucinatory history to which we shall have to refer more\nthan once. The percipient, who was at the time, as it turned out,\nsickening for an illness, saw, whenever she looked towards it, a black\ndog sitting in a corner of the stairs. The case, however, differs from\nthe last in that she appears to have seen the phantom only from a\nparticular landing.\nThe following is a recurring illusion of, we believe, a rare type. its\nrecurrence not depending on a constant objective basis. The percipient\ntells us that there had been a special sympathy between her and the\nsister spoken of.\n(407. 2.) From Miss M. H.2\nNovember 6th, 1890.\n\" Always, in my room at night, the reflection of a light or of the moon,\nor anything white against the darkness, assumes the figure of a younger\nsister, who died a few years ago ; and whether she seems dressed in white or\nin a dark brown (and she is always in either one or the other), her hair is\nlong and flowing, as she had not worn it for several years before her death.\nExcept for this circumstance, which I noted with some curiosity, I always\nregarded it as a memory ' materialising.' \"\nA case like this, though we have classed it, in accordance with the\npercipient's view of it, as an illusion and not as a hallucination, seems\nto be almost on the line between the two, and we have introduced it here\n1 Recurrence is a feature much commoner among hallucinations experienced\nduring some degree of ill-health than among those of normal health (see p. 164).\nsMiss H. has also experienced a visual hallucination of a dying friend (see\np. 250, foot-note).\n\fRelation of Illusions to Hallucinations. 105\nto illustrate the transition.1 It is hard to conceive how an illusion,\nproduced under such varying conditions, should constantly assume the\ndistinct likeness of a familiar human figure, unless the misinterpre\ntation of sense-percepts is aided by a tendency to externalize an image\nwith which the mind is much occupied.\nThe following case is similarly transitional.\n)69. 14.) From Mr. W. S.\nMay 24tfi, 1889.\n\" When I was about 18 or 20, I was travelling in the Highlands with\nmy father and three other gentlemen. About ten miles on this side of\nBallachulish ferry, he left me, saying that he would walk on towards the\nferry, with one of the gentlemen. After half an hour's delay, we drove\non in the carriage, eagerly looking out for my father, for the night was at\nhand ; he was a bad walker, and his comrade was a very reckless person.\nWe saw no sign of him, nor had any one of the few travellers and shepherds\nwhom we met. At last we got to Ballachulish ; he was not there. I became\npainfully anxious, and sat down for a minute in the parlour of the little\ninn to consider what we should do. One of my hands, I remember, was\npressed over my eyes. I took it away, and then I saw, floating, as it were,\nbetween me and the mantel-piece, the upper half of my father's body.\n\" Do not be shocked when I tell you that the scientific element in me\nwas too much for the religious, superstitious, affectionate\u2014or whatever you\nchoose to call it. I said to myself, ' By Jove ; here's an apparition ! Let's\nsee how it can be explained.' So I looked steadily at my half-ghost, and\nsaw how a spot in the mantelpiece, a knot in the wainscot, &c., &c, had\ncombined to produce the spectral appearance. While I was doing this, the\noutlines became blurred, and the whole thing faded away.\n\" Five minutes afterwards my father arrived. He had left the road,\ngone up a come, bathed in a linn, and nearly been drowned.\n\" If he had been drowned, I should probably have believed in ghosts, or\nat all events in half ghosts, ever after.\"\nIn this case, according to our informant's description, the figure\ndid not resolve itself into the marks and knots on the background\n1 A quasi-hallucinatory illusion of this sort may explain some of the extra\nordinary recognitions of supposed materialised spirits that are liable to occur at\nspiritualistic seances. The following is an instance quoted by D. D. Home (LijhU\nandSka\/lovn ofSpiritualism, p. 342.) as the confession of an exposed medium :\u2014\"The\nfirst seance I held after it became known to the Rochester people that I was a\nmedium, a gentleman from Chicago recognised his daughter Lizzie in me after I had\noovered my small moustache with a piece of flesh-coloured cloth, and reduced the\nsize of my face with a shawl I had purposely hung up in the back of the cabinet.\nFrom this sitting my fame commenced to spread.\"\nProfessor Sorley's remarks (see p. 95) as to the resemblance of the illusory figure\nhe saw to his brother, for whom he might have taken it if his mind had not been\noccupied with another ridea\u2014namely, that of a possible burglar\u2014are instructive in\nthis connection.\n\f10G Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nwhich had aided in its formation, but remained for a short time as a\nshadowy image while the percipient was contemplating these. The\nexperience thus had a distinctly hallucinatory element, and we have\naccordingly classed it as a hallucination.\nIn the next case, the hallucinatory element is more obvious and\npredominant, though it is at first attached to a basis of actual\nsense-perception.\n(722. 5.) From Mme. A. H.\n(The account was apparently written in 1891.)\n\" C'\u00e9tait en l'ann\u00e9e 1884, Mme. A H , alors jeune fille de 20 ans,\ndemeurait avec sa m\u00e8re, veuve, \u00e0 Moscou. La s\u0153ur ain\u00e9e d'A , Mme.\nH S ,dont le mari \u00e9tait malade depuis quelque temps, occupait une\nautre maison non loin de l\u00e0.

(The first\nexperience is somewhat different, but it is convenient to give the whole\nnarrative intact).\n(406. 25.) From Mr. W. A. C.\nMay 9ih, 1891.\n\" Some few weeks ago I was at a Spiritualist service. An uneducated man\nwas reading a very long and rather wearisome account of how he felt when\nin a trance. I thought I would improve the time by looking for visions,\nwhich it seemed a good Spiritualist ought to see. I fixed my attention on a\ndarkened space under the table, and near it was the foot of the reader.\nThis you can take as the suggestion, for suddenly I saw another foot near it\nin the air. The upper part was outlined in light and the marks of the lacing\nwere also short lines of light. The whole foot was, however, perfectly\ndistinct. It was not unlike the real foot near it, which was about eighteen\ninches distant. I gave a sudden start, which showed me that I was getting\ninto a semi-unconscious state with my eyes open and fixed, and the start\nwas to shake it off.\n\fRelation of Ilhtsions to Hallucinations. 107\n\" I then turned my attention to a round-globed carafe of water on the\ntable, still in search of visions. Presently the various reflections in it\ntook [a] form, [sketch enclosed] [which] reminded me of the view from\nmy native place in the West Indies, only there should have been a\nline of sea. This I looked for, and presently it came. While thinking\nhow remarkably like to the reality it was, (and, perhaps, also think\ning of ships on the sea, though I am not conscious now of having done\nso), I suddenly saw a vessel which seemed to be shipwrecked. And now\na curious chain of thought went leisurely through my mind, as I critically\nsurveyed the scene. The ship seemed in full sail and was heeling over\nas shown. Now I had been to sea and I knew the following. A sailing\nship had no right to be so near the land unless an off-shore wind was blow\ning. But if so, how did it get wrecked 1 The only conclusion possible\nwas that it had been sailing near to the land with an off-shore wind, and had\nstruck on a hidden rock. This seemed certain, for, had it been otherwise,\nthe ship should have been heeling over to the land, and not from it. Also,\nthe wreck was not caused by a storm, or the ship would not have been\nunder fmll sail, and besides, the sea appeared calm. All seemed to turn\non which way the wind had been blowing, and this I wanted to find out.\nI turned my attention to the dark foreground to see if there were any trees\nwaving in the wind, but they appeared too far away to give a clue. 1 looked\nagain at the ship, still speculating, when suddenly I saw what looked like a\nsmall cloud of vapour streaming from it. It was of a grey colour, though I do\nnot think it was meant for smoke or steam. It seemed to be only a sign to me\nthat the wind must be blowing in the direction in which it was drifting.\n\" No sooner had I accepted this as the answer to my query, than the whole\nscene vanished. All the lines in the glass seemed to run swiftly together,\nand as I looked, they took the form of a face. At first it had a painful look,\nsuch as I saw once on the face, of a drowned man ; but presently it got\nclearer, and I thought I knew it. It was sloping thus. This, perhaps,\ndirected my attention to the fact that it was the face of a man who was\nsitting [on one side of it]. It was not a reflection of him, for in a globe\nsuch could only be in miniature, and this filled the glass ; besides, when it\nvanished, as it did as soon as I had made sure of it, there was no such\nreflection there, and I could not even imagine one. The man I had never\nspoken to.\n\"All the above happened when I was wide awake and quite conscious\nof my whereabouts.\"\nCases such as these suggest that it is easier to build up\na hallucination from something of the nature of an illusion,\nthan to make it up independently of all external objects. And\nexperiments support this view. It is often easier to induce a\nhypnotised person to take a real object for something entirely\ndifferent, which the hypnotiser wishes him to see hallucinatorily, than\nit is to give him an independent hallucination. He will often, too,\nwhen a hallucination is imposed, spontaneously attach it to something\nreal\u2014to what MM. Binet and Fer\u00e9 call a point de repere.\n\f108 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nIn connection with this, we may refer to some experiments which\nMr. W. A. Dixey, the well-known optician of New Bond-street, has\nrecently carried out with \" Miss X.\", on the effect of different kinds of\nlenses on her crystal visions, the conditions being arranged so that\nshe did not know the normal effects of the lenses on real objects.1\nIn 5 out of 8 experiments, the crystal pictures changed in ap\npearance in the same way that real objects would have done on\napplying the lenses, but in the other three the changes that followed\nin the pictures on applying the lenses were not those that would have\nbeen produced in real objects.\nMr. Dixey has since repeated these experiments, under as nearly as\npossible the same conditions, with Mrs. Ve.rrall, who found, on apply\ning the lenses, that her crystal pictures either disappeared or remained\nunaffected, except in one case, where a temporary enlargement of the\npicture\u2014which was not the normal effect of the lens\u2014took place.\nThese negative results are of special interest, because Mrs. Verrall,\nunlike most crystal-seers, is conscious of using points de repere in her\nvisions, and informs us that on this occasion they were more con\nspicuous to her than usual when the pictures began to develop,\nthough, as usual, she lost sight of them when the pictures became fully\nformed.\nThe part played by the ]xiint de repere may be further illustrated\nfrom some experiments made by Mrs. Sidgwick in 1889, and described\nfrom notes made at the time, as follows :\u2014\nThe object of the experiments was to ascertain whether a moving\nhallucination would be attached to a point de repere, and, if so, how it would\nbe managed. The person experimented with was a boy named Goade, who\nwas hypnotised by Mr. G. A. Smith. Goade having been made to see a\nbeetle on a (real) sheet of plain black paper spread out before him, was\nasked to point to it, upon which he pointed to a minute white speck in the\ntexture of the paper. He was then with great difficulty persuaded that the\nbeetle was running about, and when he did realise this. he traced its course\nfrom one tiny white speck to another. Whether he saw it between the\n1 See Borderland for January, 1894. The lenses were fitted into four pairs of\neye-glasses, and, with normal binocular sight, their respective effects on real objects\nat the given distance would have been : (A) to duplicate the object vertically, (B) to\nblur it, (C) no effect, (D) to duplicate the object horizontally. Mr. Dixey handed the\nlenses to \" Mis? X.\", and the eight experiments were as follows : (1) A. gavedistance.\n(2) B , the picture disappeared, but after about aminute the colours became intenser,\nand the shadows more defined. (3) C., no difference. (4) D. duplicated the picture\nhorizontally. (5) A. duplicated it vertically. (6) A. lowered part of the picture\n(7) D. moved it to the right. (8) B. the picture disappeared. In experiments (3)\n(4) and (5) the results were what they would have beeu on real objects, while in (6)\nand (7) they were what they would have been if the right eye only had been looking\nat a real object. In (I) I2) and (8) the effects were not similar to what would have\nlieen produced on real objects.\n\fv.] Relation of Illusions to Hallucinatiori8. 109\nspecks seemed doubtful, for when asked to follow it with his finger, he\nmoved the finger rapidly in a straight line between the almost invisible\nwhite specks and paused at the specks. There was, however, one thing that\nlooked as if he saw the beetle in continuous movement, namely, that having\nbeen told to take care that it did not run off the paper, he from time to time,\nwhile seemingly watching it, snatched at the edges of the paper, as though\nto turn the insect back. The paper, it should be said, was an ordinary\nsheet of what would generally be called quite black paper, without marks\non it. It required somewhat close observation to notice the specks.\nOn a subsequent occasion Goade was given a hallucination of a teeto\ntum spinning on a (real) sheet of white paper that lay before him. He was\neasily made to see the teetotum, and to revive its spinning from time to\ntime by spinning it with his fingers. Mrs. Sidgwick continues :\u2014\" I asked\nhim to point it out to me, and he then identified a very tiny black smut as\nit. I blew this away, upon which he looked about, saying the teetotum\nhad disappeared. I advised him to look on the floor for it, and while he was\ndoing so, placed a scrap of black paper about J inch square on the white\npaper, and said ' Oh ! here it is.' He accepted it at once and said 'And ain't\nit grown !' As we blew the scrap of paper about, he followed it with ex\ncitement, and when it fell on the floor, picked it up to replace it on the\npaper, and spun it in imagination more than once, holding his finger and\nthumb above it in doing so. With a little trouble, I succeeded in removing\nit, and making him take a speck of dust for the teetotum instead, and when\nthat was blown away, I pointed to an empty space on the paper, and told\nhim the teetotum was there. He accepted this after a moment or two, and\nthen, I think. saw his teetotum moving about freely, and not attached to\nparticular specks.\"\nOf course in experiments of this kind, it is a little difficult to feel\nsure how far the hallucination went, and how far it was supplemented\nby the kind of imagination a child exercises when it uses a walking-\nstick for a horse. There was not such conclusive evidence of\nhallucination in this case as one sometimes has with hypnotic subjects.\nThe words and gestures of Goade, however, left no doubt at the time\non the minds of the spectators that he saw a hallucinatory teetotum.\nIt seems not improbable that the reason why gazing at a reflecting\nsurface, or into a refracting body like a crystal, is found in practice\nto be a way of inducing hallucinations is that convenient points de\nrepere without enough meaning of their own to distract attention are thus\nobtained. Such reflecting surfaces are also apparently favourable to\nspontaneous hallucinations. We have seventeen instances in the present\nCensus of hallucinations seen in reflecting surfaces, which seems a\nlarge proportion out of the whole number.1\n1 Of these. one was seen in a ship's compass, No. 452. 10. (see p. 238), one in a\ncarafe of water, No. 406. 25. ( see p. 106), five in mirrors\u2014(for an instance, see p.\n187), and ten in windows of which the two sides were unequally lighted, the\nfigure appearing on the darker side, e.g. No. 728. 16. (see p. 309).\n\f110 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nBut, though points de repere may facilitate the formation of a\nhallucination, there is no ground for supposing that every halluci\nnation is capable of being regarded as a kind of monstrous illusion.\nMr. Gurney pointed out in Phantasms of the Living (Vol. I., pp. 470-\n472), how difficult it is to apply such a hypothesis to a ghost standing\nin the middle of the room or moving across it, and the present\ncollection certainly supports the view that many hallucinations are\nentirely independent of points de repere, since, in more than half of the\nvisual cases, the figure is seen to move in various ways.\nThe following case, which is quite a typical one of a moving\nhallucinatory figure, may be taken as an instance.\n(400.16.) From Mr. A. E.\nMarch 23rrf, 1891.\n\"I saw my mother pass from the hall into the card-room which commu\nnicated both with the hall and the drawing-room. This occurred in 1880 in\nValparaiso (Child), the time being about seven in the evening. I was stand\ning at the piano, singing, and was in no way out of health or anxious. My\nage would be 14. So struck was I by her going into this room that I stopped\nsinging and called her name ; on going into the room it was empty, and I\nfound my mother sitting in the dining-room. My sister was playing for me,\nand remarked that I must be dreaming, as she saw nothing. I never\nexperienced anything since or before.\"\nThe collector made further enquiries of Mr. E. as to the details of his\nexperience, and wrote to us as follows :\u2014\n\"Mr. E. was in the drawing-room [at] the piano, when his mother passed\nwithin a yard of where he sat. He says he saw her distinctly pass him and\nenter the card-room, which said card-room led out of the drawing [room],\nthe drawing-room itself opening on to the hall. The card-room was in\ndarkness, so he got up, followed the figure, and asked : ' What are you doing\nthere in the dark, mother ? ' No voice responding, he immediately went\nand found his mother in the dining-room, which dining-room opened from\nopposite side of hall. She, his mother, laughed, and told him he must have\nbeen dreaming ; but he certainly was much impressed by the vision, and has\nstill a most vivid picture of it in his own mind. His eyesight was, and is,\nvery good.\"\nThe question whether an experience is a hallucination or an illusion\nis from the nature of the case more difficult to decide in auditory than\nin visual cases. Illusions of hearing are extremely common, partly\nbecause of the difficulty of localising accurately the sources of sounds,\nand partly because the acoustic properties of any locality\u2014especially\nany building\u2014are so complicated that it is, in most cases, practically\nimpossible to know what the limits of hearing by ordinary means\nare. One cannot in any case see through a brick wall, but\n\fv.] Relation of Illusions to Hallucinations. Ill\nwhether one can hear through it or not depends on a number of con\nditions, which are not easy to determine. Further, the capacity of the\near for hearing varies a good deal at different times in the same\nperson ; and a hypertesthetic state of the ear\u2014such as is reported to\noccur sometimes in the hypnotic state, and in certain cases of illness\u2014\nmight extend the ordinary limits of hearing in a way that could not be\nparalleled by any known form of hyperesthesia of vision, because of\nthe different nature of the obstacles to perception in the two cases.\nWe are therefore inclined to allow considerable scope to the\npossibility that supposed auditory hallucinations are real sounds mis\ninterpreted. This applies especially, among the kinds included in the\nCensus, to the type that we have distinguished as \"voices,\"\u2014i.e., the\nhearing of vocal sounds, where definite words do not appear to have\nbeen heard. It also applies in some degree to hearing the name called,\nsince we are so much accustomed to having our attention drawn by\nthis means that we are probably always\u2014unconsciously\u2014more or less\non the watch for it, and may therefore be liable to interpret as such\nany sound indistinctly heard. It should be observed, however, that\nthe probability of illusion is decidedly less where the voice heard is\nrecognised\u2014especially if it is that of a deceased or absent person.\nIn some tactile cases, it is also difficult to draw the line between\nhallucination and illusion. Involuntary muscular twitches, for in\nstance, may give rise to tactile sensations like those ordinarily\nproduced by contact with an external body, and the absence of such a\ncause for the sensations could hardly ever be demonstrated. Thus\none percipient (Dr. J. W., No. 81. 9.) writes:\u2014\"I have felt a slight\nsensation as of my shoulder being touched,which is entirely due to\nmuscular action.\" The next case may also be very plausibly put down\nto a similar cause, but as it is impossible to prove that the experience\nwas thus produced, we have thought it best to include both these cases\nin our tables as hallucinations of the purely subjective class.\n(50. 12.) From Mr. W. B.\nApril ldth, 1892.\n\"About 2 years ago, age 33, good health, though working hard, I was\ngoing home from college, and being in a hurry I took a tram car to within\n200 yards of my lodgings. I then left the car and walked smartly about 100\nyards, when I thought I felt some one touch me on the shoulder as if [he]\nwanted to speak to me. The impression was so vivid that I stopped\nsuddenly and looked round, when there was no person even near me. I\nthought it strange and began thinking what it could have been. So rum\nmaging through my mind for a physical cause (it never for a moment struck\nme then, nor even now, that it was ultra-physical) I remembered that I had\nsat on the top of the car with my back leaning against an iron bolt ; and so\nat once concluded that it was simply a muscular contraction due to the\n\f112 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\npressure of the bolt. The impression of being touched by some one was very\nvivid, and I remembered it at once when the form (A) [was put] into my\nhand.\"\nThe possibility of illusion is not entirely excluded in some of the\ncases where the impression is made on more than one sense, especially\nwhen the affection of one of the senses is of an indefinite or rudimen\ntary kind; for instance, when non-vocal sounds, as foot-steps, are heard\naccompanying an apparition. In 56 out of these cases, the sound\u2014\nof raps, foot-steps, doors being opened, etc.\u2014was heard first, and we\nthink it probable that it may sometimes have been a real sound, which\nled to the seeing of the apparition through expectancy.1 In a few\ncases the probability that the sounds were real is considerably increased\nby the fact that they were heard by more than one person, only one\nseeing the apparition afterwards.\nThis point is further discussed, with illustrations in Chapter X.\n\fvl] Form and Development of Hallucinations. 113\nChapter VI.\nFORM AND DEVELOPMENT OF HALLUCINATIONS.\nOne of the facts brought out most strongly by our Tables is the\ntendency of hallucinations to assume familiar forms. The ghastly or\nhorrible apparitions dear to writers of romance seem to be very rate\namong healthy grown-up people1\u2014at least, among those who are\neducated. The great majority of hallucinations are like the sights we\nare accustomed to see, or the sounds we are accustomed to hear, and\neven when they are not so, they often suggest, as we shall see, a sort\nof incompleteness in a hallucination of a natural object, rather than a\nhallucination representing something unnatural. In the exceptional\ncases where the hallucination does represent a non-natural being, we\nfind it assuming the conventional form. An angel, for instance, takes\nthe form with which art has familiarised us, and we should be sur\nprised to find one appearing to a grown-up person arrayed in \" blue\nboots\"\u2014like those seen by Mrs. D. when a child (see Appendix D.)\nMost visual hallucinations represent human beings,2 and most of\nthese resemble human beings of the present day in all respects.\nAccording to our statistics, more than two-fifths of the realistic human\napparitions represent living persons known to the percipient, and,\nof these, 45 per cent. represent inmates of the same house as the per\ncipient, or persons frequently, or (in a few cases) very recently, seen\nby him, while in another 20 per cent. they represent near relatives of\nhis \u2014that is, parents, grandparents, children, husbands, wives, brothers\nor sisters. We have included among hallucinations representing\nfamiliar figures the comparatively small class of cases (seven in our\ncollection) in which the percipient sees his own apparition. For an\ninstance of this see No. 555. 5 (p. 74).\nIn the great majority of realistic cases, the apparition represents a\nsingle figure only, though there are exceptions. A very peculiar case\nof the contrary is No. 464. 15 (Miss Dodson's case in Chapter XVII).\nAs far as the reports as to dress enable us to judge, phantoms,\nboth recognised and unrecognised, generally appear in ordinary modern\ndress, and do not affect old-fashioned costumes any more than real\npeople do. When they move, which, as we have said (p. 110), happens\n1 Of the 33 cases classed by us as \" grotesque, horrible, or monstrous,\" more than\nhalf were experienced by children, and 3 others by persons not in their normal state\nnf health. Among the 23 cases excluded from the Tables because they occurred\n<luring illness of the percipient, 4 are \" grotesque.\"\n5 In the present collection, 830 out of 1,112 do so. Mr. Gurney found that in\nhis collection, out of 302 subjective visual hallucinations, only 20 represented objects\nother than human beings. (See Phantasms of the Living, Vol. 1, p. 503).\nI\n\f114 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nmore often than not, the movement is almost always such as we are\naccustomed to see. The phantom stands on the ground and appears to\nwalk along the ground, and seems to leave the field of vision as a\nhuman being would, by walking out of an open door or passing behind\nsome obstacle. A position impossible for real persons,\u2014such as being\nup in the air,\u2014when the figure is otherwise realistic, is very rare. We\nhave only one instance of it. The proverbial gliding movement, sup\nposed to be characteristic of apparitions, is rarely reported. (For an\ninstance, see No. 256. 17, p. 310.) Appearance or disappearance by\nan unrealistic means is also rare, though there are about a dozen\ncases in our collection in which the ghost seems to enter or leave a\nroom through a wall, book-case, closed door, or window, or by passing\nup through the ceiling or down through the floor.\nEven when a phantom is stationary, it does not usually either\nsuddenly appear out of empty space, or similarly vanish before\nthe percipient's eyes, but is generally seen by the percipient on turning\nhis eyes that way, and vanishes, he does not know how, or when he is\nlooking away. There are, however, instances of sudden appearance\nand disappearance in free space. See, for instance, No. 118. 20\n(Phantasms of the Living, Vol. II., p. 462.) Again in No. 338. 20 (see\np. 261), the percipient \"simply ceased to see the figure;\" and the\nfollowing is another case of this sudden disappearance, which happened\nin a clear space and in good light.\n(243. 14.) From Mrs. M.\n(The account was written in 1889. )\n\" At , in Dorsetshire, at one o'clock in the day, about 1866, on going\ninto my bedroom just before lunch, I found an old gentleman sitting on\nthe sofa, dressed in a sort of shooting costume of grey tweed with gaiters ;\nhis hands were clasped in his lap and his head bent down : the figure\nappeared perfectly natural, and I looked at it for several seconds in surprise,\nthinking it was someone who had mistaken the room, when it suddenly\ndisappeared, which alarmed me so that I ran out of the room, and related\nthe experience.\n\" I was paying a visit to my uncle, who had lived in the house for several\nyears. I was in perfect health and spirits.\n\" The impression was that of a complete stranger.\n\"There were no other persons present at the time, but my aunt after\nwards told me she had had a similar experience in the same room ; and that\nthe maids would not enter it alone because the bell rang occasionally when\nit was unoccupied.\"1\n1 As we have not been able to obtain first-hand evidence from the other percipient\nmentioned, we have not felt justified in treating this case as anything more than a\nsubjective hallucination.\n\fvi.] Form and Development of Hallucinations. 115\nAn instance of a nearly, but not quite, sudden disappearance of\nthis kind occurs in the case quoted on p. 74 (No. 661. 5) and another\nwill be found in the course of Mrs. D.'s account of her experiences\n(Appendix D).\nIn the following case, in which, if the account is accurate, the cause\nis primafacie telepathic, the process is slightly different.\n(692. 2.) From Mr. G. Q.\nApril, 1892.\n\"Early in November, 1879, as I was walking up Collins-street. Melbourne,\nAustralia, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was amazed to see, amongst\na number of people on the other side of the street, a very intimate friend,\nwhom I believed to be in New Zealand at the time.\n\" I ran across the street to speak to him ; and, as I neared the kerb-stone,\nit seemed that a hand was passed momentarily before my eyes, its direction\nbeing downwards. In that instant my chum was gone ; and, though I\nlooked everywhere round me, and could distinguish others I had seen before\nthe curious darkness, I never saw him again. About three weeks after, I\nlearned that he died that very day and hour, (Nov. 3rd or 5th, about four\no'clock: I cannot remember the exact date). I was, of course, broad awake.\nI nras also in the best of health and spirits ; not thinking of my friend, and\nnever dreaming of meeting him in Melbourne.\"\nChanges of Form.\nThough realistic apparitions are usually realistic from first to last,\nsome pass through stages in the course of development or of dis\nappearance, which, on the assumption that both the initial and final\nstages are constructed by the mind of the percipient, stand in need\nof some explanation.\nIn some cases it may be reasonably supposed that one stage of the\nhallucination creates an expectation of the next, which tends to work\nitself out. This probably often happens, for instance, in cases where\nmore than one sense is affected and where a sense of presence precedes\nthe seeing of a ghost. The effect of expectation will be more fully\ndiscussed in Chapter X.\nIn other cases, the whole process is like what we are familiar with\nin dreams, one idea or image leading on to another by transitions out\nside the conscious thought of the percipient. The following are in\nstances of this :\u2014\n(39. 3.) From Miss E. A.\nOctober 2,irf, 1891.\n\"I saw a figure standing by my bed. I had been awake some time. It\nwas a summer morning, about 5 o'clock, and I saw the figure quite distinctly.\nIt was tall and dressed in something grey, falling in long folds. The face was\nkind and I was not frightened at first, but it suddenly changed and the whole\nl 2\n\f116 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nfigure and face, as it were, fell to pieces in the most ghastly manner and\nvanished. I was about 22. It must be nine years since it [happened].\"\n(150. 4.) From Mrs. L. H.\nNovember 2, 1891.\n\" I think the vision that I am about to describe occurred in March, 1891.\nI was asleep, when I woke with a start, it then being early morning. On\nlooking round the room, I distinctly saw the head of a skeleton floating in\nthe air, about a foot from the ceiling. I gazed at it intently (being now quite\nawake), when I saw it gradually change to my mother's head and face and\nfloat away, seemingly through the ceiling. My age [was] 35.\"\nThe process of development is less easy to explain in some other\ncases\u2014those, for instance (four in our collection) in which an indefi\nnite cloud-like form is first seen, and then a clearly defined figure,\neither developing out of it or appearing in the midst of it. It may\nperhaps be compared to the process of groping after an idea in thinking\nout a difficult subject ;\u2014the idea comes to us vaguely at first, and only\ngradually acquires definiteness. An instance of this is No. 458. 9.\n(see p. 322) and the following is another.\n(495. 6.) From Mrs. Gordon Jones.\nCheam Lodge, Anerley, Surrey, November 4th, 1891.\n\" In the autumn of 1881 a party of young people and myself determined\non All Hallow's Eve to play at the childish game of sitting separately in dark\nrooms, with supper laid for two,with the intention of awaiting the appearance\nof a future husband or wife. Thmking the whole thing a joke, and not in\nthe least expecting to see anything\u2014alone\u2014I distinctly saw\u2014first a filmy\ncloud which rose up at the other end of the room\u2014then the head and\nshoulders of a man, middle-aged, stout, with iron-grey hair and blue eyes\u2014\nnot in the least the picture which a young girl would imagine she saw on\nsuch an occasion.\n\" [I was] in perfect health and spirits. Age 17.\"\nIt may be added that the gentleman whom the percipient subsequently\nmarried had no resemblance to this apparition, not even in regard to the\ncolour of his eyes. Two or three years before, Mrs. Jones had had another\nexperience, in which the apparition went through a similar process of\ngradual development, and a third experience of hers is given on p. 127. i\nA few more or less similar cases are given in Phantasms of the\nLiving (e.g., Vol. II., p. 176 and p. 182), and with some crystal-seers\nthe pictures seen go through similar stages of development. Mr.\nMyers, in fact, mentions the process as one generally characteristic of\ncrystal visions. (Proceedings, S.P.R., Vol. VIII., p. 478.) Miss A. says\n(Op. ext. Vol. VIII., p. 500) : \" After a minute or two, I seem to see a\nvery bright light in [the crystal], which disappears after a few seconds,\nand then the surface appears cloudy and thick. This mist clears\n\fvi.] Form and Development of Hallucinations. 117\naway, and I see sometimes views, sometimes faces, sometimes letters.\n. . They only last for a few seconds or sometimes minutes, and\nbetween each new picture I see the same light and then mist.\"\nAnother case somewhat similar to those given above, but where the\ndevelopment is even more gradual, is No. 328. 5 (see p. 235).\nIn other cases, a vague shadowy form is first seen, which gradually\nacquires definiteness. Some instances are given in Phantasms of tht\nLiving (e.g., Vol. I., p. 526 and p. 527). The following is the only case\nexactly of this kind in the Census :\u2014\n(607. 1.) From Mr. T. A.\nMay 9th, 1892.\n\" I saw a darkish vapour leave my father's head when he died, about 12\nyears ago, and it formed into a figure, full-sized, and for seven consecutive\nnights [I] saw it in my own room and saw it go each night into the next\nroom, in which he died. It became more distinct each night and brighter\neach night, till it was quite brilliant, even dazzling, by the seventh night. It\nlasted, say, lh minutes. It was dark when the phantom used to appear. I\nwas quite awake, going to bed ; [age] 32.\"\nIn some cases, what is first seen is a glow of light\u2014the apparition\nsubsequently appearing in it. See, for example, No. 290. 3. (p. 293),\nand No. 33. 25. (printed in Proceedings, S.P.R., Vol. V., p. 462).\nIt is possible that in some cases where the initial impression is\nvague, it may really be of the nature of an illusion, which works itself\nout into a definite sensory hallucination owing to the habitual impulse\nto interpret our sensory impressions definitely : but we have not any\nclear evidence of this.\nGradual disappearance is, perhaps, rather more common than\ngradual appearance, and sometimes similar stages are passed through,\nas will have been noticed in examples already quoted. More often the\npercipient simply tells us that the phantom \"gradually disappears,\"\nby which we must probably understand a gradual fading and becoming\nindistinct, as the real objects, temporarily obscured for the mind by\nthe phantom, reassert themselves. This is sometimes described by\nsaying that the apparition becomes transparent. Possibly No. 69. 1 -t,\n(see p. 105), is an instance of this; and the following (a case originally\nbelonging to Mr. Gurney's Census) is a very interesting one.\nFrom Dr. H. C.\nJune 29th, 1889.\n\"In the year 1863, (I think I could find out the very day and year, with\na little trouble. It was a Tuesday, five days before the death of a lady\nwhom I used to connect in my mind with my vision. But I did not do this\nwhen I related my story in the morning after, nor till after the death\nof the lady ; and I now reject this connection as a fanciful addendum,)\n\f118 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nbeing about 26 years old, I was sleeping alone, without having indulged in\nany heavy supper. I woke up suddenly and with my wits all about me, but\nwith a clear feeling that somebody was in the room. There was enough\nlight to make things perceptibly visible, and that was all. There was no\nmoonlight streaming in to cause lights and shadows. As I started up and\nraised myself on my elbow, I saw a tall lady in a rich black dress (silk I\nthink, with black beads and a train behind,\u2014I knew once, but I have\nforgotten,) looking steadily at me with a most gentle, meditating gaze.\nAbout 40, I should say. I now say that I [did] not at all recognise the face.\nThere was a far-away look in her eyes, and I felt as if she had been reading\nme through. She rested the elbow of one hand in the palm of the other,\nand in the first hand there was a little duodecimo volume with rubric and, I\nthink, ' black letter.' I was entirely calm, eagerly interested, but rather\nscientifically then imaginatively. I pinched myself to find out if I was really\nawake. I took my watch and held it to my ear to hear whether it was tick\ning. I tried my pulse, which was normal. I then said aloud (in order to test\nmy sobriety and calmness), ' This is an optical delusion. I shall now put my\nhand through this appearance.' I did so, and my hand went through as it\nwould through water, (only without the slightest sensation,) the clothes\nkept their folds and position (as water keeps its level) making no break.\nMy hand with the white night-shirt sleeve was wholly hid, and when I with\ndrew it,there was no hole left behind,any more than when one withdraws one's\nhand from water. After some 40 or 50 seconds I saw a straight white line\ncrossing the figure. I could not make out what it was, till 1 perceived the\napparition was slowly vanishing away in its place, and the white line was the\ntop of my towel on the towel-horse behind. Bit by bit the white towel\nand other dimmer objects in the room came into sight, behind what was\nbecoming a faint mist. In about 20 seconds it had completely vanished.\"\nThis interpretation of gradual disappearance\u2014that it is due to\nreal objects of vision reasserting themselves\u2014seems the most natural\none. We can hardly suppose that it is due to the idea going through\nan indefinite stage, which seems a possible explanation of gradual\nappearance. On the other hand, the gradual appearance of a hallu\ncination would be likely to create an expectation of its gradual\ndisappearance, and so bring it about by suggestion. This may\naccount for the hallucinations which disappear through the same\nstages as those they pass through in appearing, as in No. 290. 3 (see\np. 293). A change into a cloud-like form in the course of disappearance\ndoes not, so far as we know, occur when the same modification has not\noccurred in the course of development.\nMany hallucinations never attain a completely realistic form;\u2014.\ntheir development is, as it were, arrested, and they remain in some\nsense incomplete to the end. These are included in the class of \" in\ncompletely developed apparitions \" in our Tables, but they are of\nvarious kinds. There are (a) the transparent or shadowy figures,\nwhich seem to represent a perfectly definite idea, but, as sensory\n\fvl] Form. and Development of Hallucinations. 119\nhallucinations, fail to assert themselves completely among the real\nobjects of vision. There are 33 of these cases. In only 1 2 of them is\nthe figure definitely described as \" transparent,\" in whole or in part ;\n\" shadowy,\" however, is probably sometimes used in this sense (in the\ncase, for instance, of \" a shadowy black dog \") ; and possibly \" misty \"\nmay sometimes mean semi-transparent, as well as colourless. It seems\npossible that in some of the cases in which a transparent apparition\nwas motionless, it may have been an illusion, rather than a hallucination.\nBat other cases of motionless transparent apparitions seem to be\nclearly genuine hallucinations, for instance, No. 643. 22 (see p. 103)\nand No. 402. 8 (see p. 284) In five out of the twelve cases also,\nthe transparent figure was seen to move in such a way as to make it\nalmost certain that it could not have been an illusion. The following\nLs an instance of this kind :\u2014\n(546. 19.) From Mr. G. B. L.1\n(The account was written in 1891.)\n'\u2022 [I saw] a figure of a man which was perfectly transiiarent, and which\ncame into the room and sat down on a chair by my side. It was about ten\nyears ago. I was in bed and had been suffering from severe illness, which\nhad affected my head. My wife [was present]. She saw nothing, though I\nmentioned it to her.\"\nFor another case of a moving transparent figure see No.\n49. 5, p. 143.2\nSecondly, there are\u2014among incompletely-developed apparitions\u2014\n(A) cases where the incompleteness of the figure seen seems to be\ndue to the vagueness of the idea underlying it. This is the natural\nexplanation of very rudimentary and vaguely defined figures, such as\nNo. 554. 13 (see p. 268) and Nos. 49. 2 and 3 (see p. 312). But it is\nprobably also applicable to cases where the figure is distinct, but\ncompletely veiled or shrouded, so that no details of features or hands\nare perceived. The following are instances :\u2014\n(233. 7.) From Miss A. F. K.\nMay, 1889.\n\"[About 14 years ago] I was awakened in the middle of the night with\nvery acute pain in the middle of my back ; I sat up in be 1 and saw a\n1 This case Li not included in our Tables, and, therefore, is not one of the twelve\ncases just mentioned, because it occurred during an illness of the percipient's, to\nwhich it may have been due.\n5 In another case, a semi-transparent figure, dressed in a black hat, surtout and\nblue waistcoat, was seen in the middle of the day to emerge from a wall, cross part\nof a garden, and disappear into the opposite wall, and a short time after come out\nand retrace its steps, disappearing finally into the first wall. But the percipient\nis not included in the Tables, because he was only twenty at the time he answered\nthe Census question.\n\f120 Report on the Census of Hallucinations.

From Miss H. T.\n(The account was written in 1889.)\n\" I have seen a figure three times. I cannot remember the exact\ndates ; the figure appeared to me between the years 1867 and '76. The form\nappeared each time directly I got into bed. I have always been in good\nhealth. [It] always appeared in the same way ; that is, on getting into bed\nand putting the light out, there would be a sort of movement in the air,\nwhich gradually took the form of mist and then developed into a dark veiled\nfigure, which came nearer to me and when bending over and about to touch\nme I threw my hands into it, and it vanished. Until it was almost touching\nme, my terror was so great that I could neither call my sister, who was asleep\nbeside me, nor move hand or foot. I am pretty nearly certain that I was 17\nwhen I first saw the figure ; the last time I do not remember, excepting\nthat I was over 18 and most probably over 20. I don't remember about the\nlight, excepting that there was enough for me to see everything plamly.\"\nThis last case is an interesting example of gradual development\nfrom the mere impression of a movement in the air up to the incom\nplete form which the hallucination finally reaches.\nA third group of incompletely developed apparitions\u2014that, namely,\nin which the face or head of the figure is indistinct\u2014seems to belong\nto the class where the idea represented is probably vague. The\nfollowing is an instance :\u2014\n(68. 25.) From Mrs. A. W. Verrall.\nMarch 12th, 1887.\n\"One evening about the middle or end of September, 1879, as I was\nwashing my hands in a little room at the end of the passage leading to the\nfront door, at 24, Vernon Terrace, Brighton, I heard footsteps, and looking\nup saw a little old lady coming towards me. She was dressed in a dark dress\ngathered round the waist in full folds, a grey knitted shawl over her shoulders\nfastened with a brooch in front, and a cap. I did not see her face, although\nshe was walking towards me. I knew at once that it was a hallucination,\nbut was neither startled nor alarmed. The figure disappeared before\nreaching the room where I was. During the next two or three weeks, I saw\n' my old lady,' as I called her, more than once\u2014always facing me, and in the\n\fvi.] Form and Development of Hallucinations. 121\nact of approaching. I am not sure how many times I saw her at Brighton,\nbut I can distinctly remember three occasions beside the first, and have an\nimpression that there were others. I spoke of her to my mother and sister,\nand though I usually saw her when I was alone, I remember once seeing her\nwhen my sister and I were sitting in the dining-room. Gradually I came to\nsee further details\u2014the brooch fastening the shawl was like a circular brooch\nwith a hole in the centre worn by my great-grandmother, Mrs. Watkins, who\nhad died some ten years before. In the end I called the figure my great-\ngrandmother, but I never saw the face.\n\" I came back to Cambridge on October 13, and entirely forgot my\nhallucination, till one evening, as I was going upstairs to my room , I heard\nfootsteps coming along the passage at the top of the house, and looking to the\nleft (instead of turning to the right to my room) to see who it was, saw my\nold lady coming towards me. There was no one else in the passage ; the gas\nwas lighted, and I saw the figure plainly. This was the last time I saw it.\nOn the first and last occasions of my seeing the figure, I had heard the sound\nof footsteps, on the intermediate occasions the impression was only visual.\nThe figure always took its place in the surroundings (i.e., hid the things\nbehind it), and was always in movement \u2014coming towards me ; the only odd\nthing about it was that I never saw the face - there seemed a blank within\nthe cap. I ought to say that although at the time I saw the figure I had no\nreason to suppose that I was not well, I had had a short illness in Switzer\nland some two weeks earlier, due, it was thought, to over fatigue, after some\nweeks of considerable strain in other respects.\n\"M. iiB G. Verrall.\"\nOf the three different groups which we thus place in class (b) of\nincompletely developed apparitions, there are in our collection 21 of\nthe first, 19 of the second, and 6 of the third.\nThe remaining hallucinations included among the incompletely\ndeveloped apparitions are incompletely developed in a different sense.\nThe great majority of them (47 cases) represent parts only of human\nbodies, and it is merely on account of their fragmentary character that\nwe have thus classified them ; since the percept, as far as it goes, is\ndistinct and definite, and there is no reason to think that the mental\nimpression which gave rise to it is in any way vague, though it cer\ntainly seems in some cases to be freakish and dream-like.\nInstances in which the head or face is represented are No. 495. 6\n(see p. 116), No. 69. 14 (see p. 105), and No. 191. 3 (seep. 240).\nThe following is another which also illustrates a process of piecemeal\ndevelopment unique in our collection.\n(80. 7.) From Miss G. 0.\n(The account was written in 1889.)\n\"I saw in 1871 [when aged about 12] the face of an aged woman which\nwas grey and thin.

[chap.\nleaving a blue mist. The face was decidedly ugly and unhappy looking. I\nhad just got into bed and extinguished my candle. ... I saw in 1874\na very pretty child's face ; it appeared in exactly the same way as the\nother. On each occasion the apparition appeared on my left side.\"\nIn 15 cases a hand, or hand and arm only, are represented (see\nNo. 579. 25, p. 241), and in three cases, legs. These fragments are\nseldom recognised as the limbs of any particular person, though\nit happens that the instance of a hand quoted, as well as one\ninstance of legs, are exceptional in this respect. The following is\nanother case :\u2014\n(460. 12.) From Dr. C. G. H.\nAugxist 22ud, 1891.\n\" Place, Osmaston Park, Derbyshire. Autumn of 1870 (somewhere\nabout then), about 7 p.m. I was crossing the park with my brother, 2 years\nyounger than myself, and saw distinctly as it were two black legs walking\ntowards us ; so much so that I stopped and called my brother's attention to\nthem ; he failed to see anything. 1 pointed where they were and then they\nvanished. We walked to the spot, as it appeared to me, about 10 yards off\nand could see nothing, neither did we hear anything. I saw the legs most\ndistinctly and went next morning to see the spot.so vivid was my recollectiou.\nAs regards daylight, it was clear and only just getting dusk. [I was] simply\ngoing to the post, in good health, no grief or anxiety ; 17 years of age.\n\" My brother could not see anything, though I pointed to the legs and\nsaw them at the time I pointed.\n\" I had time to see them and stop walking, point to them, and say to my\nbrother, ' Look ! there they are, two legs. Can't you see them ? ' and they\nwere then gone.\"\nDr. H. adds later :\u2014\n\"The legs ended abruptly, absolutely abruptly. I could make out no\nbody or semblance of one. The vision was most vivid and 1 have never\nexperienced anything similar. The evening was darkish, but perfectly clear\nand bright.\"\nWe have thought it convenient to class with incompletely developed\napparitions, instead of making a separate heading for them, five cases\nof hallucinations which do not appear solid, but are like a picture, or\nseem to be projected on a flat surface. The following is a case of this\nkind :\u2014\n(707. 1.) From Mrs. B.\nDecember llf\/i, 1891.\n\" I distinctly saw my mother's face upon the wall ; it smiled and passed\nalong the wall and faded away.

I\nwas at Ramsgate.\"\nMrs. B. states that this is the only hallucinatory experience she has ever\nhad.\nMiss Porter writes :\u2014\n\"I called upon Mrs. B. on December 18th, [1891]. As the experience\ntook place so long ago and no corroboration is now possible, I did not ask\nfor an account in narrative form.\n\"Mrs. B. described the apparition as exactly like a coloured picture of\nher mother, head and shoulders, which passed along the wall and faded.\nShe did not mention what she had seen to anyone, and the following even\ning an aunt of hers arrived from London to tell her that her mother was\ndead. The aunt had started that morning by the steamer, the death having\ntaken place the previous evening. On her return home the child told her\nfather what she had seen. He asked her what time it was, and on hi.r\nreplying that it was nearly 8 p.m., he said that her mother died at a quarter\nto eight, and that the last thing she had done was to speak of her one little\ndaughter, and beg him to take care of her.\n\" Mrs. B. at the time was in no sort of anxiety about her mother.\nThere was a baby expected (which the child did not know) and the mother\nhad been unwell, but the week previously an aunt had been at Ramsgate\nand had told the child that her mother would now soon be well and would\nbe coming to stay for a time at Ramsgate.\"\nThe cloud-like forms which hallucinations sometimes pass through\nin development suggest that the experiences which we have classed as\n\" apparitions of indefinite objects \" may really be undeveloped\nhallucinations. We have only 1 7 instances of them. They are vague\nshapeless forms, not suggesting anything in particular, sometimes\ndescribed as like a shadow, or puff of smoke, or cloud, or a dark mass.\nThey seem generally to be visual percepts of the simplest possible kind,\nand show the power of the mind in constructing hallucinations at its\nlowest point.

As we have\nseen, hallucinations of realistic human figures are occasionally evolved\nout of vague luminous forms, and some of the cases of hallucinatory\nlights suggest that the hallucination has been arrested at this preli\nminary stage, and has failed to reach a more definite form ; e.g.t No.\n408. 11 (see Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VI., p. 351). But there. are\nother cases where the hallucinatory form is very definite and does not\nitself suggest that greater definiteness might, under different circum\nstances, have been attained. The only reason for regarding such\nhallucinations as undeveloped is that in some instances we seem to be\nable to trace them to suggestion, ordinary or telepathic, and that the\nsuggestion in question would naturally be expected, if it produced a\nhallucination at all, to produce a human figure. The following is a\ncase in point.\n(191. 2.) From Miss Williams.\n\"11, Cleveland-terrace, Coatham, Redcar, September 23rd, 1889.\n\"I was living at home with my parents at Eston-in-Cleveland. There\nwas a working man called Long living in the village, not far from our house,\nwhose wife was taken ill. Dr. Fulton, who at that time was staying with\nus, came in one night between 9 and 10 o'clock and said Mrs. Long was\ndying. After that we sat talking over the. fire a good while, and then my\nsister Isabella and I went off to bed. We slept in a back bedroom, and after\nwe got to this bedroom I said, ' Oh, I've forgotten something in the large\nbedroom !' To this latter I proceeded by myself, and, as I approached the\ndoor, something seemed to say to me, ' You'll see something of Mrs. Long,\nliving or dead ! ' But I thought no more of this, and entered the bedroom,\nwhich I had to cross to the opposite end for what I wanted. When I had\ngot the things in my hand, I noticed a lovely light hanging over my head.\nIt was a round light\u2014perfectly round. I had taken no light with me, hut\nwent for the things I wanted in the dark. I looked to see if there was any\nlight coming in from the windows, but there was none : in that direction\nthere was total darkness. I grasped one hand with the other and stood\nlooking at the strange light to be sure that I was not deceived and was not\nimagining it. I walked across the room to the door, and all the way the\nlight was hanging between my head and the ceiling. It was akin to the\nelectric light : something of a cloud, though every part of it was beaming\nand running over with light. It left me at the bedroom door. On first\nseeing it a strange impression seized me, and after it left me I was so\nimpressed that I could not speak of it to anyone for a day or two. I\nwondered at the time whether it had anything to do with Mrs. Long, and on\ninquiry I found that she died just about the time when I saw the light If\nthere was an'y difference, I judged it would be a little before, but there\nwould not be much in it. This would be about 11 p.m , and about four\nyears ago. It left an impression on my mind which I have never forgotten,\nand never shall forget. Mrs. Long was not ill many days\u2014about two or\nthree ; she died rather suddenly. I was rather interested in her. I did not\nsee her during her illness, but had often seen her and talked to her before.\n\fFoith and Development of Hallucinations. 125\nI was perfectly well at the time. and was in no trouble or anxiety. My age\nat the time was 23. I have had no experience of the kind before or since.\nI saw no figure, only a lovely light. Before telling my sister I made her\npromise she would not ridicule me nor call me superstitious.\n\"To the best of my recollection this is a correct statement.\n\"Mary Helena Williams.\"\n-' P.S.\u2014-The light which I saw was a palish blue. It emitted no rays, so\nthat all the rest of the room was in darkness. Tt was wider in circumference\nthan my head, so that as I walked I could see it above me without raising\nmy head. As I left the room it remained, and when I looked again was\ngone. It was in a corner, where the darkness of the room was deepest and\nthe least chance of illumination from the windows on the right and left, that\nI first saw it above my head. I had no fear, but a kind of sacred awe.\nThe light was unlike any other that I ever saw, and I should say blighter\nthan any other, or, at least, purer. Looking at it did not affect the eyes.\nIt was midway between my head and the ceiling.\"\nThe sister who was with Miss Williams at the time corroborates her\naccount as follows :\u2014\n\"August 8th, 1891.\n\" I recollect my sister Lily seeing the bright light. When she came back\nto the room where I was she was quite pale, and sat down on the floor. She\nwas so awe-struck that she did not tell us what she had seen till the next\nday. I remember that a woman who lived near us died about the time my\nsister saw the light, and that we connected the two circumstances together.\n\"Isabella Fulton.\"\nHere, the hallucination, if not due to a telepathic impulse, would\nseem to have been due to the occupation of the percipient's mind\nwith the idea of the imminent death. \"Why, then, should it take the\nform of a light, unless this was, as it were, a rudimentary condition of\na hallucination which failed to reach the human form 1\nAmong the lights in our collection, 9 are described as round or\noval lights, or balls of light or fire ; of these 7 are connected by the\npercipients with some individual who is stated to have died at or\nabout the time of the experience. Of the remaining 8 cases of lights,\ntwo are described as columns of light, or luminous clouds about the\nheight of a human being, 3 resembled bright points of light, as stare\nor candle flames, and 3 appeared like a general glow of light.\nSymbolic Forms.\nThe discussion of lights leads us naturally to another cause of the\nform of hallucination which deserves to be noticed, namely, symbol\nism:\u2014as this would seem to be certainly in some cases an explanation of\nlights. The idea of light as a symbol of the soul or spirit\u2014and conse\nquently as associated with death\u2014is a very wide-spread one. The\n\" corpse-candles \" of the Celts are a familiar instance, and the same\n\f126 Report on the Census of HaUitemations. [chap.\nidea prevails among the Tartars. No doubt, when a superstition of\nthis kind his become established, it is likely that any unexplained\nphenomenon fitting in with it will tend to be regarded as supernatural,\nand this probably accounts for many of the Welsh stories of mysterious\nlights foreboding or coinciding with deaths. We have received several\naccounts of such lights in the course of the present Census, but most of\nthem were seen out of doors at night and some way off, so that there\nseemed to be no adequate reason for regarding them as hallucinatory\nat all. But though real lights are likely to be taken for \" corpse-\ncandles \" in regions where such a superstition exists, it may be taken as\ncertain that the superstition will sometimes determine the form of a hal\nlucination which in other regions would have taken an entirely different\nform, and thus the hallucination, whether veridical or purely subjec\ntive, may justly be described as symbolic. Such symbolic representa\ntions need not, of course, be confined to uneducated percipients, since\nthe symbolism may exist in the minds of persons who attach no\nsuperstitious value to it. The following is a case in point.\n(305. 4.) From Mr. P.\nFebruary, 1891.\n\" Our third child, a boy, lived only 16 days. From the first it was evident\nthat his life would be a short one ; but, perhaps all the more on that account,\nevery effort was made to prolong it. I had taken a small share of the watch\ning, and just before the boy died was lying on a sofa in that state of wakeful\nweariness that comes of death-bed watching. Lying thus, I saw, a few feet\nabove my head, a blue flame. It was about an inch and a quarter long,\nand surrounded by a slight haze or halo. It hovered above me for a few\nseconds, then took an irregular diagonal course towards the corner of the\nroom farthest from me, finally seeming to pass through the ceiling. As it\nvanished a voice from nearly the opposite side of the room said, ' That's his\nsoul.' No person other than myself was in [the room] at the time. A few-\nminutes later the child died.\n\"Having never at that time heard or read of a similar appearance, I\nknow of nothing that could have predisposed me to, or in any way led up to,\nthis hallucination. The date was January 17th, 1867.\"\nSpecial symbols, signs, or warnings are, as everyone knows,\nconnected with death in some families, and if hallucinations occur to\nmembers of these families, they are not unlikely to take a form with\nthe idea of which family tradition has rendered the percipient\nfamiliar. We have in the Census two or three accounts of families,\nseveral members of which have experienced hallucinations of white\nanimals\u2014for instance, dogs or rabbits\u2014which are regarded as a family\nsymbol of death. With these may be compared No. 733. 5 (see\np. 72),\u2014a case received from Brazil, where, as Professor Alexander\ninforms us, a black butterfly is supposed to be a sign of death.\n\fvl] Form and Development of Hallucinations. 127\nAp1xtritions of Animals.\nMost of the apparitions of animals in our collection have, however, no\nsymbolic character, but, like the realistic apparitions of human beings, are\nhallucinatory reproductions of familiar objects. The 25 cases divide\nthemselves into 13 cats (for instances see Nos. 535. 2 and 3, p. 305 ;\nand No. 561. 24, see p. 156) 4 dogs, 1 rabbit, 1 mouse, 1 bird,\n1 butterfly. 1 horse with carriage, besides 3 recurring cases in which\nthe percipient often saw cats, and 2 in which Ixith cats and dogs\nappeared. In only 3 or 4 cases was the animal recognised. No. 319. 1\n(see p. 181) is an instance, and so is the following.\n(495. 6.) From Mrs. Gordon Jones.\nFebruary 22wf, 1892.\n\" I have the strongest aversion to cats\u2014a tendency which I have in\nherited from my father, who could not endure a cat's presence. After my\nmarriage, I would never have one in the house, until obliged t.i do so on\naccount of mice. The one that I then allowed to come was an ordinary grey\nand black striped one\u2014but I very seldom looked at it, and it was never\nallowed to come upstairs.\n\" One day I was told that the cat was mad and asked if it might be\ndrowned. T did not look at the animal myself, but said, yes. I next heard\nthat it had been drowned by the groom in a copper. As the cat was not a\npet and had never been my companion, its death made no impression on me.\nIt was drowned in the morning. The same evening I was sitting alone in\nthe dining-room. I am sure that I was not thinking of the cat or of possible\napparitions. I was reading ; presently I felt impelled to look up, the\ndoor seemed to open, and there stood the animal that had been drowned in\nthe morning ; the same cat, but apparently much thinner and dripping with\nwater\u2014only the expression of the face was changed\u2014 the eyes were quite\nhuman and haunted me afterwards, they looked so sad and pathetic. I felt\nso sure of what I saw that at the moment I never doubted that it was the\nliving cat who had escaped from drowning. I rang the bell and when the\nservant came I said ' There's the cat, take it out ; ' it seemed to me that she\ncould not but see it too\u2014it was clear and distinct to my eyes as the table or\nchairs. But the servant looked frightened and said ' Oh, ma'am, I saw the\ncat after William had drowned it\u2014and then he buried it in the garden.'\n'But,' I said, ' there it is.'\u2014Of course she saw nothing, and then the cat\nbegan to fade, and I saw nothing more of it.\"\nIn an accompanying letter, Mrs. Gordon Jones says that this incident\noccurred \"two or three years ago.\"\nInanimate Forms.\nOf the remaining classes of hallucinations in our Tables, visions\nhave been sufficiently discussed in Chapter IV., and grotesque appari\ntions will be best considered in Chapter VIII. in connection with\nchildish hallucinations. But it may be mentioned that the \"appari\n\f128 [chap.\nRpport on the Census of Hallucinations.\ntions of inanimate objects \" include 3 cases of apparent movements of\nreal objects (which may, perhaps, have been mistakably regarded as hal\nlucinatory) ; 2 cases of appearances while the percipient was in bed (one\nof wings and one of an ostrich feather) waving and growing in size,\nwhich might, perhaps, equally well be classed with grotesque cases ;\nand 9 cases of ordinary realistic inanimate objects, such as a bird-cage,\na chair, flowers, a bonnet, a brass plate on a door, a railway train.\nReligious Phantasms.\nSeveral of the religious phantasms are more or less impressive\nappearances of angels ; which in some cases\u2014e.g., when they appear\nwith the conventional wings\u2014may be regarded as symbolic. But in\nother cases, the experiences are of so exceedingly intimate a nature\nthat it is with difficulty our informants have brought themselves to\nspeak of them at all, and in one instance, at least, and probably in\nothers, information has been refused. In one case, at least, of those\nreported, the percipient has only described what occurred in the hope\nthat, as the experience had been of very great help to herself in a\nperiod of doubt and trouble, the knowledge that such a thing has hap\npened might be of use to others ; and in more than one case these ex\nperiences have had a lasting effect on the convictions and actions of the\npercipients. Under these circumstances, we are reluctant to print\nthem in a treatise such as this, though we are willing to communicate\nthe most interesting of them privately, and without names, to serious\nenquirers.\nWe will here only mention further one fact about such experiences\nwhich is of interest to psychologists, namely, that the kind of vision\nwhich to Roman Catholics takes the form of the Virgin Mary will to\nProtestants take the form of Jesus Christ. We judge this, not only\nfrom the present collection, but from cases received through other\nchannels. As it happens, there are not in our Census any visions of the\nVirgin Mary, but our readers will remember instances of these in\nPhantasms of the Living, and in more than one paper in the\nProceedings S.P.R.\nDeferred Recognition.\nIn this chapter on form and development, we must notice a kind of\ngradual development in hallucinations which is unlike any that we\nhave discussed above. It is the very curious feature of deferred recog\nnition. Here there is no development in form, nor, it would seem, in\nthe underlying idea. The figure is seen quite clearly, but, though\nfamiliar, is not recognised at once\u2014sometimes not till long after it has\ndisappeared. There are two cases of this in our collection, No. 49. 5\n(see pp. 144-5), and No. 402. 8 (see p. 284.) The phenomenon resembles\n\fvi.] Form and Development of Hallucinations. 129\nthat of automatic writing when the writer is unaware till afterwards\nof what his hand is writing. It has also some analogy with a pheno\nmenon observed by Mr. Myers1 in certain cases of post-hypnotic\nhallucinations, when the idea communicated to the hypnotised subject\nis more or less correctly embodied in a post-hypnotic hallucination,\nbut not recognised by the percipient.\nA sort of mistaken recognition which seems to occur in some coin\ncidental cases may be due to a similar divergence between the uncon\nscious and conscious working of the mind \u2014see, for example, two\ncases in Phantasms of the Living (Vol. I., pp. 428 and 429) where\nan apparition seen at the time of the death of one person was\nthought at the time to represent another person, who, however,\nresembled the decedent. In the following odd case from our collection,\nwhich in some ways resembles these, there was, however, at the time, a\nsort of double recognition.\n(407. 3.) From Mrs. H. H.\nOctober 4lh, 1890.\n\" [At] Taunton, Mass., U.S.A., September 9th, 1862, about 5 a.m. or\nperhaps a little later, I was awakened very suddenly and sat upright in\nbed, thinking that someone was present ; and saw by my bedside the figure\nof an old man, who was somewhat like one who lived in the same street.\nHis head was bound with a handkerchief, and he stood gazing at me for\nwhat seemed to be a few seconds, then vanished. Though recognising him\nperfectly, I all the time thought that it was my husband.\n\"I had been asleep all night, was in good health, but of course somewhat\nanxious, as my husband was in the war and in poor health, owing to\nwhat was called 'swamp fever.' My husband was at Fortress Monroe,\nVirginia, and died at 5 o'clock on that day. He had aged very much,\nwa\u00bb quite gray and a perfect skeleton. For four days before he died, his\nmemory had gone altogether and his only words, hour after hour, were\n' Write home. '\n\" My children were in that room and the next, but were not disturbed,\nuntil I spoke to the eldest and asked if she had heard anyone about. I\nreceived a telegram at 10.30 a.m.\"\n1 See his paper on \" The Subliminal Consciousness, \" in Proceedings S.P.R. , No.\nXXIII., Vol. VIII., page 459 seqq. We quote one instance from Mr. Myers'\naccount. It must be understood that P. has been told that he will see the scene as\ndescribed, after he has been awakened. \" I told P. (hypnotised) the story of Robin-\nsonCnitoe finding the footprint and fearing savages. . . . Awakened and set before\nthe glass of water, P. at once exclaimed, ' Why, there's Buffalo Bill ! He's dressed\nin feathers and skins round him ; almost like a savage. He's walking about in a waste\nplace. . . . He is all alone. ... I can see something else coming from\nmother part\u2014it's a blackie. . . . Look at them ; how they are arguing !\nBuffalo Bill and his black man ! ' P. had read Robinson Ccusot ; but Buffalo Bill was\nfresher in his memory.\"\nK\n\f130 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nMrs. H. informed us that she mentioned her experience at the time to\nher eldest daughter, who now remembers it, but only vaguely. No written\nrecord was made.\nAuditory and Tactile Hallucinations.\nSome points with regard to auditory and tactile as distinct from\nvisual hallucinations require notice. In comparing hallucinations\nfrom a statistical point of view, the most obvious and striking fact\nbrought out by our Tables is the comparative rarity of the auditory\nand tactile classes. These constitute 28 per cent and 10 per cent.\nrespectively of all the hallucinations reported, the remaining 62\nper cent. being visual.1 These proportions, however, need correction\non two accounts. First, we have already seen (Chapter III., p. 66)\nthat auditory and tactile cases tend to be forgotten considerably more\nthan visual cases, so that the actual frequency of the auditory and\ntactile cases is greater in proportion to the visual than would appear\nfrom the totals reported. If we take only the totals reported as having\noccurred during the last year, we find that 50 per cent. are visual\nhallucinations, 38 per cent. are auditory, and 12 per cent. are tactile.\nSecondly, it appears from the Supplement to Table II. that there are\n159 cases where auditory hallucinations have been experienced more\nthan once, but where the exact number of times has not been reported,\nso that they are counted as one hallucination only ; whereas this has\nhappened in only 119 cases of visual hallucinations. It has happened\nalso in a comparatively large number of tactile cases, viz., 41.\nAfter taking into consideration these two points, it seems to us\nthat our statistics do not justify any definite conclusion as to the\nrelative frequency of the auditory and the visual hallucinations of the\nsane, when we are considering the whole aggregate of phenomena\nclassed under either head. We think it, however, legitimate to infer\nthat impressive hallucinations of the visual class are considerably more\nfrequent than those of the auditory,2 and that auditory hallucinations\nin general are considerably more frequent than tactile.\nAmong hallucinations of insane persons, there seems to be no\ndoubt that auditory cases are much more frequent than visual, the\nproportions being estimated by some authorities as 3 to 1, by others as\n5 to 1, (see Phantasms of the Living, Vol. II., p. 22). These figures\n1 These percentages are calculated from the totals given in Tables IV., VII. and\nVIII., which include under each sense all hallucinations affecting that sense, whether\nor not any other sense was affected at the same time.\n5 This does not agree with the conclusions arrived at by Mr. Gurney, in whose\nCensus the number of auditory hallucinations was more than double the number of\nthe visual (see Phantasms of the Living, Vol. II., p. 22).\n\fvi.] Form and Development of Hallucinations. 131\n0\ncontrast strikingly with the proportions among sane persons, as reported\nin the present Census.\nAs we have seen, auditory hallucinations are on the whole much\nless impressive than visual ones. It appears from Table VII. that\nnearly one-half of those reported consist in the percipient's hearing\nhis name called (including under the term \" name \" any title by which\nhe is in the habit of hearing himself called, such as\u2014Father, Mother,\nMadame, etc.) and about another sixth consist in the hearing of\n\" voices \" when no distinct words are heard\u2014or at all events are\nnot reported. Experiences so trivial as these usually are will no\ndoubt be often forgotten altogether, and the probability is that a\nvery large part of those that have lapsed from memory are of this\ntrivial kind.\nTo bear a complete phrase or sentence apparently spoken is no\ndoubt, as a rule, a much more impressive experience. Rather more\nthan a third of the hallucinations included in Table VII. are of this\ntype. It should be observed, however, that in only half of these cases\nis the impression that of a voice alone. In the other half, the\nhallucination also affects the sense of sight or of touch, or both, the\nwords seeming to be spoken by a visible apparition, or being accom\npanied by an impression of touch. For an instance of the latter, see\nNo. 41. 3 (p. 295). For a case of a sentence alone being heard, see\nNo. 23. 11 (p. 256). The affection of another sense at the same time is\nfound much less often among the other classes of auditory hallucinations\n\u2014there being 89 such cases in the class of \" words heard,\" and only 28\nin both the other classes put together.\nTactile hallucinations are for the most part even more trivial than\nauditory ones, and there is, naturally, not much variety in them.\nThey are sometimes quite vague tactile impressions, not associated with\nany definite idea of an external object (e.g., No. 338. 26., p. 258).\nSometimes, however, the impression is more definite and less easy to\nforget : as in a few cases where the feeling is that of a kiss. More\noften they are impressions of being touched by human hands, as in\nthe following case :\u2014\n(283. 8.) From Mrs. J. H.\n(The account was apparently written in the early part of 1890.)\n\" On February 11th, while on a visit to my cousin's, Miss O., at 9.45\np.m., while ascending the stairs to my bedroom I suddenly felt an indescrib\nable feeling of foreboding evil, which was accompanied by a distinct feeling\nof a hand grasping my left arm momentarily with a slight pressure. Within\na few minutes I rejoined the family below, to whom I immediately related\niuy experience, telling them I feared I should hear of some bad news, at\nwhich they pooh-poohed.\nK 2\n\f132 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\n\" I was in my usual health, and in neither grief nor anxiety.\n\"I took no notes, but have often related the matter to my friends, as at\n1.30 the same night I was fetched home in consequence of my father's sudden\ndeath at my aunt's house. I had no knowledge until then of my father being\nill, and, as a matter of fact, he did not feel unwell until a few hours before\nhis death, which occurred at 9.45 p.m. of the above date,1 the time being\nnoted by my uncle, who was sitting with him and looked at his watch. So\nsudden and unexpected was his demise that my uncle at first thought it was\na fit.\"\nMrs. H. says that she has had no other hallucinatory experience besides\nthe one given. She wrote to her cousins, but found that they had forgotten\nher having told them of it.\nIn the great majority of tactile hallucinations, the idea produced\nis that something is touching the percipient. In six cases only does\nthe percipient have the impression that he is actively touching the\nhallucinatory object, and this impression is\u2014in all but one case\u2014\ncombined with the affection of another sense. In four of these cases\nthe percipient sees an apparition and puts out his hand and touches it.\nThe remaining case is No. 41. 3 (see p. 295), already referred to, where\na voice is heard at the same time. So far we have been speaking of\nfirst-hand cases : but, to illustrate the combination of seeing with active\ntouching of an apparition, we propose to give a second-hand case, which\nhappens to be the most interesting one of the kind in our collection.\nThe account which we quote was written by the collector, the late\nMiss A. J. Clough, the day after she had heard it from the percipient,\nan old housekeeper, who, Miss Clough says, \" has lived in the same\nfamily 33 years and has always told the same story.\" She was then\n74 years of age, and could not write easily.\n(73. 20.)\nJxdy 16th, 1889.\n\" E. H. and her sister were in 1829, in the spring of the year (she does\nnot remember the day), with a Mr. and Mrs. , in a house in Little\nHolland House grounds\u2014in London. Her mother had been fully a year\ndead. On the afternoon of the day in question, some people had been\nspending the day, and she had been amusing some boys in the garden and\nvery merry : she went to bed rather later than usual, about 11 o'clock, and\nshe had intended to get up early as she wanted to do some fine washing.\nHer sister Caroline was sleeping with her. It was very light and she got up\nthinking it was late. The moon was shining and she went to the window to\nlook out. She thought perhaps she should hear the watchman calling the\nhour for, as she observed, they had watchmen in those days in London.\nThe bed was directly opposite the window. She walked straight to the win-\n1 In a letter dated March 13th, 1890, Mrs. H. says : \"My father died February\n11th, 1885.\"\n\fvl] Form and Development of Hallucinations. 133\ndow, and then she turned round and in the bed she saw two faces, her sister's\nand some one else. She went to the bed and looked ; it was her dead mother\ndozing beside her sister. She touched the figure but it did not move, and was\nnot cold or hot. There it lay, there was the cap her mother used to wear\nwith a border around it. She walked round the bed and kept her eye on\nthe dozing figure all the time. She felt afraid it would follow her, and she\nwas dreadfully frightened. Mr. and Mrs. were sleeping in a room next\nto hers. She went to their door and knocked. Mrs. opened it. She\nwent into the room and told her story. Mr. got up and they went into\nthe room and found no one but her sister, still sleeping soundly. She was\nonly 14 at the time.\n\"I heard all this story from the old woman yesterday afternoon, July 15,\n1889. She was very collected [in] telling it.\"\nIn a few tactile cases, the percipient not only feels a touch, but has\na sense of being pushed or pulled by an external force ; see case of\nMr. B. S. (No. 262. 6) in Chapter XVI.\n\f134 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nChapter VII.\nPHYSIOLOGY OF HALLUCINATIONS.\nIn discussing the physiology of hallucinations we shall not enter\nupon any consideration of the physiological processes involved in\nveridical hallucinations as such ; since\u2014as has already been explained\nin the introductory chapter\u2014any such consideration would appear to\nus premature in the present condition of our knowledge of the subject.\nWe shall confine ourselves to the phenomenon of hallucination,\nregarded on its physiological side, apart from whatever causes external\nto the percipient\u2014whether physical or psychical\u2014may have initiated it.\nThe first question of interest is how far the hallucination, regarded\non its physiological side, is generated in the brain or in the special\norgan of the sense affected.\nThere seems to be no doubt that in a limited number of cases, of\nspecial types, hallucinations are initiated by the condition of the sense-\norgans. Thus, in the case of unilateral hallucinations (which, if spontane\nous, are probably always accompanied by pathological conditions), a dis\ntinct lesion is sometimes found in the sense-organ of the same side, and\nthe hallucinations often cease when the lesion is cured. Also hallucina\ntions that move as the eye moves probably depend\u2014partially, at least\u2014\non something in the eye. This type, however, is very rare among persons\nin a normal condition. In the Census, we have only one apparent\ninstance of it, as follows :\u2014\n(191. 17.) From Mr. H. B. K.\nOctober ttlh, 1889.\n\" [About 20 years ago] I was walking, about 9 o'clock one night in winter,\nwhen a quadrupedal form, something like a huge calf, suddenly seemed\nclose upon me, and wherever I turned was always in front of me. I swept\nround me freely with my stick, but there was no contact. [It was] something\ndifferent from what I had ever seen before. It approached me quite closely,\nbut was shadowy, so that I could not tell its expression. It disappeared\ndown a lane leading off at right angles to the one I was travelling. [I] was\nwell and free from trouble ; from 25 to 28 years of age.\"\nAgain, hypnagogic hallucinations of such types as stars or luminous\npoints or objects, arranged as patterns or designs and shifting in a\nkaleidoscopic manner, or in which the figures move and swarm and\nchange, may sometimes be genuine hallucinations having their origin in\nthe \"self-light\" of the retina, and this explanation is also applicable\nto dreams of a similar nature. On the other hand, an observer\nquoted below (p. 141) who has recently sent us an account of his own\nexperience of hypnagogic hallucinations, remarks :\u2014\n\fVII.] 135\nPhysiology of Hallucinations.\n\" It is important to note that these visions are not based on any\naffection of the retina, [since they] retain what we estimate to be their\npositions in space, notwithstanding that the eyes be moved about.\"\nHe compares them in this respect with memory images, remarking\nthat the fact of both kinds of images being unaffected by the move\nments of the eye shows that the train of physical causes leading up to\nthem originates in the brain.\nAgain, diseases of the eye or ear are sometimes accompanied by\nvisual or auditory hallucinations ; but our evidence seems to show that\nonly a very small part of the phenomena reported to us can be referred\nto this cause. The seven following cases are the only ones in the\nCensus in which any defects of the sense-organs are reported.\n(1) No. 607.1. is a percipient subject to hallucinations. The\ncollector writes :\u2014\" He has a curious weakness of the eyes, which for\neleven years, from 17 to 28, quite incapacitated him from reading\nprint. His sight for other things, such as fine lines in a drawing, was\nexcellent, but letters in type all ' ran together.' He is better now, but\nhas still some difficulty in reading.\" It is not clear from this descrip\ntion exactly what the defect is, but it is most probably some form of\nastigmatism, which is especially troublesome in reading, and would not\nobtrude itself so much in looking at other things, such as drawings.\n(2) No. 118.21., who has sometimes seen phantasmal cats and\ndogs, is very short-sighted.\n(3) No. 68.25. has occasionally had both auditory and visual\nhallucinations. The two eyes are of very different focus, the left eye\nbeing far-sighted and the right short-sighted, so that the percipient\ncannot use both at once without glasses.\n(4) No. 49.9., while blind from cataract, saw phantasmal figures.\n(5) No. 725.11., after having been operated on for cataract, saw\ntwo figures cross the room.\n(6) No. 430.15., who is quite deaf, frequently imagines that she\nhears music, both vocal and instrumental.\n(7) No. 704.10., has sometimes fancied he heard himself called, is\nincreasingly deaf, and puts the fancies down to this cause.\nThe last four cases mentioned are not counted in the Tables, on the\nground that the hallucinations were probably due to the abnormal\nphysical condition (see Chapter II., p. 36).\nIt is to be observed that, from the nature of the ear, many defects\nin it, which from various causes give rise to deafness, may produce\nvibrations in the tympanum, which might initiate auditory hallucina\ntions. This is much more probable than that defects in the eye should\nproduce visual hallucinations.\nOf course, such common defects of vision as those mentioned in the\nfirst three cases must exist in more than three persons out of the 1,494\n\f136 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nwhose experiences are included in our Tables. But these are the\nonly ones who have thought them of sufficient importance in con\nnection with their experiences to mention them. Any actual disease\nof the eye or ear would probably have been recorded in the majority\nof cases where it was present, and this has only been done, as stated\nabove, in the four cases excluded on that ground.\nIt happens that three of the crystal-seers whose experiences have\nbeen recorded at length in the Proceedings have certain defects of\nvision. With Mrs. Verrall, the left eye is far-sighted and the right\nshortsighted. (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VITL, p. 473.) \" Miss X.\" is\nalso longer-sighted with one eye than the other. Miss A. is very\nshort-sighted. (Op. ext., p. 499).\nNow, it is well known that such imperfections of visions frequently\nlead to illusions, but there is no evidence to show that they are likely\nto produce hallucinations, and it is very improbable that the crystal\nvisions in these cases are connected with them. Mrs. Verrall is,\nhowever, inclined to think that the movements that occur in her\ncrystal visions are due to the movements of her eyes in attempting to\nbring the sight of the two eyes into correspondence, when not using\nher glasses. She is able to see pictures with either eye, but she has\nobserved that movements in the picture do not occur when she is\nlooking at the crystal with only one eye. A similar explanation was\nsuggested by the lady whose hallucinatory history is given in Appendix\nD, of some of her experiences. Her right eye is shorter-sighted\nthan her left, also binocular vision of any given object involves an\neffort, and it is to the movements of the eyes in such vision that\nshe traces the movements of the hallucinatory cats and rats, which\nalways appear to leap in the same direction, from right to left. If this\nexplanation is the true one, it may be that the apparent movement\nof real objects caused by the movements of the eyes is transferred\nby suggestion to the hallucinatory object, but there is no ground for\nsupposing that the hallucination itself is due to the defect of sight.\nOur general conclusion, then, is that the great bulk of the hallu\ncinations included in our Census are not in any way dependent on the\ncondition of the sense-organs of the percipients.\nThe view that many\u2014if not most\u2014hallucinations are originated\ncentrally, in the brain and not in the sense-organs, is that now generally\nheld by physiologists,1 as well as by psychologists. The chief grounds\nfor this view are brought forward in the discussion on the subject in\nPhantasms of the Living, Vol I., pp. 464-495, and the great majority\nof the hallucinations included in the Census exhibit characteristics\nwhich are there shown to be much more easily referable to a central\n1 See Foster's Phytiology. 5th Edition, p. 1270.\n\fVII.] 137\nPhysiology of Halhu?inationtt.\nthan to any other origin. Thus, the percipients are generally, as far as\nwe know, in a normal physical condition in all respects ; the hallucina\ntions are generally unique in their experience ; they sometimes take a\nform which is undoubtedly connected with some idea in the percipient's\nmind at the moment (for examples, see Chapter IX., p. 170); they\noccasionally develop from a non-sensory to a sensory stage, e.g.. No.\n555. 5 (see p. 286) ; in many instances, they affect more than one sense\nat the same time, and it is very unlikely that two sense-organs should\nhappen to be temporarily affected\u2014in an imperceptible way\u2014at the\nsame moment, so as to produce such a correspondence.\nProfessor Sully thinks that while vague rudimentary hallucinations\nof sight and hearing may most reasonably be attributed to the action\nof the peripheral parts of the nervous system, what he calls \" com\npletely developed \" hallucinations\u2014 i.e., of the kinds included in the\npresent collection\u2014are generally caused by the automatic activity of\nthe nerve centres. (Illusions, p. 115.) Speaking of persistent dream-\nimages, he remarks (Op. cit., p. 143) \"That the visual images of our\nsleep do often involve the peripheral regions of the organ of sight seems\nto be proved by the singular fact that they sometimes persist after\nwaking.\" The cerebral activity that produces a hallucination \"may\nprobably,\" he maintains, \" diffuse itself downwards to the peripheral\nregions of the nerves \" (p. 113), so that the sense-organs may thus\nbecome involved secondarily.\nWundt takes the same view of the physiological action involved in\nfolly externalised hallucinations,1 but he seems to base his view partly\non the assumption that hallucinations move with the movements of the\neye. As mentioned above, this is only recorded in one out of our 1,295\ncases of visual hallucinations, so that it cannot be regarded as one of\ntheir general characteristics.\nWe pass, then, to consider this hypothesis of the secondary partici\npation of the sense-organs in hallucinations through a downward sen\nsory impulse from the brain. We may begin by remarking that it\nis inconsistent with generally accepted physiological theories of the\naction of the nervous system ; or, at all events, that no physiological\nfacts are known which lend it any support. It is true that many\npersons by dwelling on the idea of a sensation, such as warmth, cold,\npressure, can apparently excite the sensation in any part of the skin,\naccompanied by definite peripheral effects, e.g., reddening of the skin.\n1 Grundziiije dcr Phytiolcgischen Psiichologie, Vol. II., p. 432. \"Visual halluci\nnations occurring before going to sleep are sometimes so vivid that, as J. MUller, H.\nMeyer and others have observed, they may be followed by after-images. In such\neases, it seems as if the excitation of the central sensory tracts had extended itself to\nthe retina. The same thing may be said of such phantasms as, in full daylight, mingle\nwith external visual perceptions.\"\nii i\n\f138 [chap.\nReport on the Census of Hallucinations.\nSuch effects give rise to sensory impulses, which, being transmitted to\nthe brain, add to the vividness of the sensation perceived. But there\nis still no evidence of any downward sensory impulse to the peri\nphery: for all the peripheral effects may be accounted for by motor\nimpulses from the brain, causing contractions of the muscles and\ndilatations or constrictions of the blood-vessels of the skin, etc. And\na similar explanation is still more obvious in other cases of peripheral\nactivity accompanying mental images like a faint echo of the cerebral\nactivity involved\u2014as, for instance, when the idea of a movement is\naccompanied by incipient movements of the kind imagined.\nThe chief argument for the existence in hallucinations of a downward\nsensory impulse, whereby the sense-organs are supposed to be affected,\nappears to lie in aa alleged resemblance between hallucinations and\nthe retinal after-images which, in ordinary vision, follow on the sight\nof an object. The parallel is drawn closer by showing that hallucina\ntions occur corresponding to both positive and negative retinal after\nimages ; the hallucinatory colours in the latter cases being comple\nmentary to those seen in an antecedent perception, real or hallucina\ntory. Now retinal after-images are dependent\u2014partially, at least\u2014\non exhaustion of the retina ; hence it is argued that, in the hallu\ncinations that resemble after-images, the retina must also be concerned ;\nand that, where the proximate origin of the hallucination is clearly\ncerebral, a downward sensory impulse from the brain to the retina\nmust be assumed. This argument requires careful consideration.\nIn ordinary vision, positive after-images of real objects are obtained\nwhen a strong stimulus has been applied to the eye for a short time,\ne.g., when a bright light is looked at for a few moments. The sensation\nthen persists for some time after the withdrawal of the stimulus,\ngiving rise to an after-image, which is perceived continuously, though\nit may wax and wane in a rhythmical way, and its apparent intensity\ndepends partly on contrast with the background on which it is\nprojected.\nNow such after-images might in all cases be regarded as in a cer\ntain sense hallucinatory ; but our inquiry was framed to exclude\nfamiliar experiences of this kind, and accordingly they have not been\nreported to us. It is held, however, that a phenomenon similar to\nsuch an after-image also occurs when images seen with closed eyes\npersist after the eyes are opened : and of this our Census does afford\nexamples, in the cases of persistent dream-images of which specimens\nwere given in Chap. IV. An account of Meyer's experiments on this\npoint is given in Professor James' Principles of Psychology, Vol. II.,\np. 67. After long practice in improving his powers of voluntary\nvisualisation, Meyer found that the images called up with closed eyes,\n\"especially when they were bright, left after-images behind them\n\fvil] 189\nPhysiology of Hallucinations.\nwhen the eyes were quickly opened during their presence. For\nexample, I thought of a silver stirrup, and after I had looked at it\na while, I opened my eyes, and for a long while afterwards saw its\nafter-image.\"\nJ. Miiller, who had spontaneous experiences of a somewhat similar\nkind, writes 1 :\u2014\" On waking in a dark room, it sometimes happens\nthat images of landscapes and similar objects still float before the\neyes. ... It. has become my custom,when I perceive such images,\nimmediately to open my eyes and direct them upon the wall or\nsurrounding bodies. The images are then still visible, but quickly\nfade. They are seen whichever way the head is turned, but I have\nnot observed that they moved with the eyes.\"\nIt is cases such as these that Wundt quotes as instances where the\ncentral nervous excitation seems to have extended itself to the\nretina.\nThere does not, however, appear to be any physiological evidence\ntending to show that the retina is involved in these quasi-after-\nimages. Moreover, in order that this hypothesis may supply a com\nplete explanation of their occurrence, we require to assume, not a\nmere affection of the retina, but a stimulus applied over a certain\ndefinite area of the retina, of the same shape as the image seen ; and\nit is difficult to suppose that such an effect could be produced by a\ndownward impulse from the brain, in the absence of any special\nmechanism for directing the stimulus to any particular part of the\nretina.\nThere is a still greater difficulty in supposing the retina to be\ninvolved in another class of cases\u2014the so-called \" deferred after\nimages,\"\u2014where a considerable interval of time elapses between the\noriginal percept and the hallucination which is supposed to be its\nafter-image.\nThe following is the only clear example of this class which our\nCensus affords : but it is not improbable that this is the real explana\ntion of the hallucination in other cases, in which the original percept\nhas been forgotten.\n(192. 21.) From Mrs. A.\n\" October 21st. 1889.\n\"I was staying at an hotel at North Berwick, N.B., in the autumn of\n1884. My daughter had joined me there, and we sat up together till a late\nhour. She wore a bright red dress and sat in bright gas-light, and as we\ntalked I had my eyes constantly fixed on her. I had been sound asleep for\nabout an hour when I woke suddenly and saw an image, as it were, of my\ndaughter lying beside me, the bright dress and complexion illuminated in\n1 Elements of Physiology. (Translation by W. Baly, London, 1842), p. 1394.\n\f140 Report on the Cen#us of Halhtcinations. [chap.\na bright light. The figure had a wooden, rigid look. I had time to sit up in\nbed and stretch out my hand to light a match before the figure vanished.\n\" I was not out of health or in grief or anxiety. I was quite alone.\n\"I have never had any such experience before or since.\n\" My own impression is that it was an optical delusion. I had had\nmy eyes fixed for a considerable time on my daughter's face, but then I had\nundressed and been some time in my room before I went to sleep, and the\nvision was so clear and vivid, as it seemed to lie beside me, that it startled\nme much.\"\nSome experiments, resembling the case just quoted, in producing\non waking in the morning the image of an object seen just before\nclosing the eyes at night, are described in Proceedings S. P. R., Vol.\nVIII, pp. 450-2. The plan of the experimenter, Mr. Bakewell, is\non waking to \" open his eyes on a plain white ceiling and instantly\nclose them again, having just admitted a vague flash of light into the\neye.\" He is inclined to regard the images seen as \"secondary or\ntardy positive after-images ; as if, in addition to the first positive after\nimage immediately arising, there was a feeble series of vibrations,\nwhich, if left undisturbed by counter-vibrations, gradually by their\nsummation came to be of sufficient importance to give a bright positive\nimage, provided any sudden uniform stimulation of the retina should\nset these banked-up energies off.\"\nWith regard to the part supposed to be played by the retina here,\nit is to be remarked that the conditions under which the \" after\nimages \" are seen are exactly the reverse of those which favour the\ndevelopment of true retinal after-images. The latter are the result of\nretinal activity and the stronger the stimulus or the more sensitive the\nretina, the more vivid is the image, which persists for some time and\nthen gradually fades. In Mr. Bakewell's experiments, on the other\nhand, as in Mrs. A.'s case quoted immediately before, the image\nfollows on a condition of the greatest possible repose of the retina,\nwhen the eyes had been for a long time closed, and in the dark. It\nwould therefore seem much more probable that it is merely a memory-\nimage,\u2014that is, that it originates in the brain and has nothing to\ndo with the retina. This interpretation is applied by another\npercipient, Dr. Flournoy, to a similar set of experiences\u2014hypnagogic\nhallucinations which reproduced real objects on which he had concen\ntrated his attention for a long time during the previous day\u2014quoted in\nthe same paper (Op. cit., pp. 453-4). Dr. Flournoy remarks, \" I regard\nthese hypnagogic images and all memory-images, however recent and\nintense, as radically different from the ' after-images ' of the eye.\"\nOther instances of this type are given in Phantasms of the Living, Vol.\nI, p. 490. The following case is taken from a paper \" On the Limits of\nVision \" by Dr. G. J. Stoney, published in the Philosophical Magazine\n\ftil] 141\nPhysiology of Hallucinations.\nfor March, 1894. It will be seen that Dr. Stoney takes the same view\nas Dr. Flournoy of the origin of the images.\n\"The experience I had myself was one which frequently occurred to me\nwhen a lad. Several of us boys were fond of witnessing sham fights in\nthe Phosnix Park, at which some of the most conspicuous objects were the\nsingle horsemen who now and then galloped at full speed, with orders, from\none part of the field to another. Almost always, after a day spent in viewing\nthis spectacle, as I lay in bed at night I saw vividly what seemed to be a\ntiny horseman galloping violently from right to left, or from left to right, as\nthe case might be. All the movements of the horse were reproduced, the\ndashing about of the sabre-tache, the coloured uniform, the movements of\nthe horseman. It cannot have been in the retina that this revival took\nplace. It must have been in a much more deep-seated part of the brain.\"\nThis explanation seems also applicable to the following case which\nappeared in Nature for October 5th, 1 893 :\u2014\n\" A remarkable case of resuscitation of an optical image is described from\npersonal experience by Professor T. Vignoli in a paper recently commu\nnicated to the Beah Instituto Lombardo. On the morning of July 3rd, after\na railway journey in a bright sun, and two days' walk in a suffocating heat,\nhe happened to be in a room with several other persons, and during conver\nsation looked at a balcony bathed in bright sunlight, but without taking any\nspecial interest in it. The balcony was decorated with trellis-work and ivy.\nFlowering creepers were arranged in vertical columns, each column being\ncrossed below by the iron bars of the balcony, and above by sticks sup\nporting the plants. A cage with two birds hung up in the middle. Two\ndays afterwards, very early in the morning, the professor was in bed, but\nperfectly awake, and in ordinary health, when, to his astonishment, he saw\non the ceiling, by the light coming through Venetian blinds of two large\nwindows, an exact reproduction, in all its colours and details, of the balcony\nreferred to. The phenomenon lasted long enough to permit some detailed\ninvestigation. On closing the eyes, the image disappeared, to appear again\nwhen they were opened. It was unaffected by regarding it with each eye\nalternately. A finger placed between the eye and the image intercepted it\nin the same manner as it would any ordinary object ; in short, the phenomenon\nobeyed all the optical laws of vision. And not only was the cage of birds\nreproduced, but also its swinging motion noticed before.\"\nSimilarly, in the following case, taken from our Census, there is a\nconsiderable interval between the original impression and its hallu\ncinatory reproduction, which makes it practically certain that it could\nnot have been due to retinal action.\n(733. 18.) From Mr. F. De V.\nMarch 29th, 1892.\n\" I heard a noise in the corridor, and on looking that way I saw a man\nin grave clothes, standing at the entrance. 1 was much terrified, and\nrushed out into the back premises, whither my father followed me to find\n\f142 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nme stretched upon the ground. Place Maceio, capital of Alagoas, Brazil,\nyear 1868, 8 o'clock in the evening more or less. The man seen had very\nlong hair. The impression was very vivid.\n\" I was studying, but was in a very nervous state. Age 11.\n\" My imagination was tormented by the image of the man who appeared\nto me. I knew [him], and I had found him shortly before lying in his coffin\nin the church. The sight of the corpse had produced a profound impression\non me, and was the cause of my nervousness. The sound might have had\na very natural cause.\n\" I was alone in the room.\"\nAll these hallucinations seem to be of essentially the same type,\ndiffering from one another chiefly in the length of time between the\nvision of the real object and that of its hallucinatory reproduction, but\nby such comparatively small degrees that it would be arbitrary to draw\nthe line at any point, and to say that one of them was a retinal after\nimage and another a memory-image. In all cases, the retina must have\nlong recovered from the effects of the original stimulus, and\u2014except\nwhen the hallucinations occurred on waking\u2014had been subjected to a\ngreat number of subsequent stimuli. There is nothing in the physiology\nof the retina, so far as this is known, to suggest the possibility of any\nsuch selective retention of after-images as would be implied in recurring\nto a long-past impression, after passing through a subsequent series of\nimpressions. On the other hand, a memory-image can, of course, recur\nat any time.\nThe repetition of a hallucination, after a shorter or longer interval,\nseems to be a phenomenon of the same kind. The second hallucination\nmay be called an \" after-image \" of the first, but is probably nothing\nmore than a revival of memory of the first, excited by some association\nof ideas, as that of being in the same place, or under similar circum\nstances again. For instance, hallucinations induced during one\nhypnosis may recur spontaneously in a subsequent hypnosis.\nSome interesting instances of hallucinations traceable to the revival\nof memory of long past scenes are to be found in the experiences of\n\" Miss X.\" {Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. V., pp. 506-510) which seem to be\nof essentially the same nature as the \" deferred after-images \" already\nquoted, though the interval before the recrudescence of memory was\nmuch longer\u2014so long that the percipient had often forgotten the\nscenes pictured till she was reminded of them by seeing them again\nrepresented. The first experience described in the following case is\nsomewhat analogous.\n(49. 5.) From Mrs. L.\n(The account was written in 1889).\n\"In September, 1854, I was thrown from a dog-cart on to my head, and\nstunned. My life flashed before me, but the only thing that remained was\n\fvrt] H3\nPhysiology of Hallucinations.\nthe appearance of a red setter dog, running at me. This continued many\ndays, and I could not speak of it. My mother came and then I told her I\nfeared my brain was injured, as I was haunted by a red setter dog. She\nsaid directly that, being very nervous, she had not wished me to be told or\ntalked to about it, but that, before I could speak, the nurse put me down on\nthe lawn, whilst she ran back to the house. I had on a little grey fur\npelisse, and before they could reach me, a large red setter dog of my uncle's\nhad run at me, and shaken me nearly unconscious, taking me for a rabbit.\nAfter this explanation, the dog never appeared to me again.''\nMrs. Sidgwick writes :\u2014\n\" July 14th, 1889.\n\" I saw Mrs. L. yesterday and questioned her about the dog case. I\nthink it was an externalised hallucination. She could not describe the\nimpression very clearly. A dog's head at her side snapping at her seems to\nhave been what she saw, and she gave me the impression by her gestures\nthat it was continually\u2014during the few days that she was haunted by it \u2014\nappearing sideways, but in the direct line of vision, and disappearing when\nshe looked full at it. At all events it was not. apparently, a full view of a\nwhole dog which could be followed with the eyes and taken for a real dog.\nShe is quite clear as to the correspondence of her visionary dog and her\nmother's account of the real one, but of course the recollections are not now\nindependent. It is some confirmation of the correspondence, perhaps, that,\nwhile stunned with the blow, remembered scenes of early childhood passed\nvividly before her\u2014in particular some connected with the illness of a\nfavourite dog, which died when she was about six years old. These\nremembered scenes did not, however, haunt her, and probably they were\nnot fully externalised ; they occurred during the more definite brain\ndisturbance at the time of the fall. She probably had a slight concussion,\nbut went about as usual, though feeling and looking very ill, and saw no\ndoctor till two or three days after the accident, when her mother came. It\nwas during these few days that the dog haunted her and gave her the\nimpression that her brain had been injured, till her mother dispelled it.\"\nIt will be convenient to quote in connection with the above\nanother experience of the same lady's, though here the hallucination\nwas probably not a reproduction of anything actually seen, but of\na scene vividly imagined at a remote period, and afterwards recalled\nthrough association of ideas, of which the links can be traced.\n\" About September, 1881, aged 46, and 18 months after the sudden death\nof my mother, which had shaken my nerves very much, one night towards\nmorning, being awake to the best of my belief, I saw a woman come through\nthe door. Her face was sideways and I distinctly saw her features. She\npassed slowly from the door and went out at window opposite, thus passing\nacross the foot of my bed. She had on an old-fashioned bonnet and an old-\nfashioned caped cloak, and she was carrying a basket in front of her such as\ncountry women carried their husbands' dinners in. The whole figure was\nsemi-opaque, neutral tinted, like thick smoke or cloud. A great hurricane\nwas blowing. I was dreadfully disturbed and hysterical next day,\u2014the\n\f144 [chap.\nReport on the Census of HoMucinatians.\nimpression so vivid, and yet unable to say who it was. About a week after,\nthe revelation came. I sat down to dinner, became very hysterical and\nfaint, and went into another room alone in the dark. All at once I jumped\nup saying, 'It is Mrs. Beasant.' Mrs. Beasant was the pretty young bride\nof a farmer with whom when about ten years old we used to go and take tea\nat a farm two or three miles from the vicarage. One day she went with her\nhusband's dinner as usual and he was felling a tree. She passed the wrong\nway and the tree fell on her and killed her. I remember watching her\nfuneral with my nurse, and the anguish of spirit at her death, but never\nremember speaking of it or the circumstance since. The day before the\nappearance, a nurse of the name of ' Beasant ' had disturbed and annoyed\nme. A few months before, a large elm-tree had fallen in our garden and\npartly on the house. A hurricane was blowing at the time, and I remember\nthinking ' what a lucky thing that tree can't fall on the roof.' I was sleeping\nalone.\"\nWe have now to consider the class of hallucinations that resemble\ncomplementary or negative after-images of some antecedent hallucina\ntory percept or voluntarily produced image. It is claimed that the\nantecedent percept must have involved an affection of the retina, and\nso produced a negative after-image ; and, since it is clear in most\u2014if\nnot all\u2014of the cases in question that the first percept originated in\nthe brain, a downward sensory impulse from brain to retina has to be\npostulated, in order that the retina may be involved.\nWe will give examples of hallucinations of this class before dis\ncussing their explanation. MM. Binet and Fer6, who have tried\nmany experiments on hallucinations of colour induced in their hypnotic\nsubjects, with results more uniform than those obtained by most other\nobservers, say, {Animal Magnetism, p. 191) :\u2014\"We have seen subjects\nwho could at pleasure, and in the waking state. . . when looking\nattentively at a sheet of white paper, cause it to appear red, blue,\ngreen, etc., and the colour thus evoked would be sufficiently distinct\nto give birth in due succession to the complementary colour, which\nthe subject could indicate correctly.\" M. FeVe' found that he could\npicture to himself the idea of red so intensely that at the end of a few\nminutes he was able to see a green patch upon the white paper ; but\nrepeated efforts were required before he was able to associate an outline\nwith the colour. (Op. cit., p. 255).\nWith their hypnotic subjects, they found that complementary after\nimages, resembling in all respects a normal negative image, followed\non induced hallucinations of colour, and the experiments were repeated\nby Charcot. They state that these experiments have always succeeded\nwith subjects who were certainly ignorant of the sequence of com\nplementary colours, and the answers were always given correctly in\nthe first experiment. Their results are confirmed by previous observa\ntions made by M. Parinaud on the phenomenon of simultaneous con\n\fVII.] 145\nPhysiology of Hallucinationa.\ntrust ; he found that a piece of paper divided by a line, on being\npresented to a hypnotised subject, to whom it was suggested that one-\nhalf of the paper was red, appeared to her green on the other half.\n(Op. cit., p. 250).\nMM. Binet and F\u00e9re also experimented on the mixture of\nimaginary colours and found that it gave resultant shades which\nwere in conformity with optical laws. (Op. cit., p. 256.) Similar\nexperiments have been tried with the same results by Professor\nLombroso, who made his subjects look through a glass of some given\n(hallucinatory) colour at hallucinatory images of the solar spectrum.\n(Proceedings, S.P.R., Vol. VIII., p. 447). So uniform were the results\nobtained by MM. Binet and FeYe* that they generalised from them\nthus (in speaking of after-images) :\u2014\" We have ascertained that\nhallucinatory vision is subject to the same conditions fas ordinary\nexternal vision] ; every hallucination of some persistence is succeeded,\non its disappearance, by an after-image, just as in the case of ordinary\nsensations which affect the retina.\" (Op. cit., p. 252.)\nFurther, Dr. C. T. Green, of Birkenhead, records an experiment\nwith one of his hypnotic subjects, who, after being made to see a\nhallucinatory red cross, soon saw the complementary colour sponta\nneously 1 ; but the results of other observers and experimenters have\nvaried a good deal. Again, with regard to colours voluntarily\nvisualised, Mr. Keulemans (Proceedings, S.P.R., Vol VIII., p. 480)\nstates that after calling up mentally a bright red he can sometimes\nsee the complementary colour on the ceiling, though he cannot get the\ncomplementaries of pale shades, such as lemon yellow, and lilac, greys\nor brown.\nA few cases have also been recorded of dream-images persisting\nwith complementary colours. Gruithuisen (quoted by Professor Sully,\nIllusions, p. 144), \" had a dream in which the principal feature was a\nviolet flame, and which left behind it, after waking, for an appreciable\nduration, a complementary image of a yellow spot.\" The following\nsomewhat similar case was received by us a short time ago, from the\nHon. Mrs. Drummond :\u2014\n\" 64, Lower Leeson-street, Dublin, Nooember 4th, 1892.\n\" I was dreaming of being in a drawing-room furnished with a variety of\nknick-nacks in glass and china, when my attention appeared to be arrested\nby a large green vase of particularly graceful shape. I felt myself gazing\nintently at this object, when I awoke very suddenly and completely.\n\"I occupied a few seconds in looking about me, collecting the letters\nwhich had been brought in, when a slight uneasiness in my eyes made me\nclose them.

But the inference of several psychologists1 that the retina\nmust be involved in such cases seems to us quite unwarrantable.\nAs Mr. Gurney points out, such after-images do not \" imply more than\nthe brief continuance of excitation at the central cells\"2: and MM.\nBinet and Fere themselves do not think of inferring from their experi\nments any affection of the retina : they merely infer from them that\nhallucinations involve an excitation of the sensory centres in the\nbrain.\nIt is probable that even ordinary retinal after-images of real objects\nare not dependent solely on fatigue of the retina,3 and Professor Hering\nleaves the question open as to whether the physiological processes\nwhich he considers to be associated with the formation of after-images\ntake place in the brain or in the retina.\nThat cerebral action alone is at all events capable of producing\nsimilar effects seems to be shown by some experiments published by\nMr. John Gorham in Brain (1881-2), Vol. IV., p. 465, in which colour-\nsensations received through one eye modified those received through the\nother. In one experiment, (a) the effect of simultaneous contrast,\n1 The views of Professors Sully and Wundt have already been quoted. Professor\nJames also says :\u2014(Principles of Psychology, Vol. II., p. 70). \" The current demon\nstrably docs flow backward down the optic nerve in Meyer's and F4re\/a negative after\nimage. Therefore it can flow backward ; therefore it may flow backward in some,\nhowever slight, degree, in all imagination.\" He applies the same theory to the com\nplementary hallucinatory colours in M.M. Binet and Fern's hypnotic experiments.\n2 Phantasms of the Living. Vol. I., p. 487, foot-note.\n3 \" We have no right to suppose that the exhaustion takes place in the retinal\nstructures only ; it may occur in the central cerebral structures during the develop\nment of visual impulses into sensations ; indeed the chief part of it is probably of\nsuch a oerebral origin.\" (Foster's Physiology, 5th edition, p. 1266.)\n\fVII.] 147\nPhysiology of Hallucinations.\nwhich is generally associated with the action of one part of a retina\non another part of the same, was produced by the apparent action of\none eye on the other. While green light was falling into the right eye,\nand white light\u2014through a pin-hole\u2014into the left, the left eye seemed\nto see a small pink disc. In the next experiment (6), the conditions of\n(a) were maintained until the effect just described was produced, and\nthen the green light was removed from the right eye. The pink disc\napparently seen by the left eye then turned green. In repeating these\nexperiments, we have observed that the green colour in experiment (b)\nis much more obvious than the pink in experiment (a). A somewhat\nsimilar experiment, though with a different result, is described by\nProfessor James (Principles of Psychology, Vol. II, p. 71, foot-note).\nOn looking with one eye open at a coloured spot on a white back\nground, then closing that eye and looking with the other at a plain\nbackground, a colour complementary to the first will appear. We\nhave not, however, been able to verify this result from personal\nexperience.\nIn all these experiments, the appearances seen, as far as the eye\nwhich' receives only white light is concerned, can hardly be due to any\naction of the retina of that eye, and must, therefore, depend on\ncerebral action. The cerebral action is, of course, initiated by the\nstimulation applied to the other eye; but the effect, which is apparently\nproduced on one eye through the influence of the other, is actually a\ncerebral effect.\nThis view is confirmed by \" Miss X.'s \" experiences in crystal-\nvision (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VIII., p. 484) ; of which a\nnoteworthy feature is that while one crystal picture shows a\ncolour complementary to that of the preceding one, the form of the\nsecond picture may be entirely different from that of the first.\nThus, a lady in a blue gown is replaced by a little boy in a bright\norange garment ; a pale green picture of a man tearing up palings is\nfollowed by a red picture of the corner of the library. This pheno\nmenon clearly cannot be compared with an ordinary retinal negative\nafter-image. Miss X. also says that after staring at a (real) red flower\nshe can see a green one in the crystal (such a case may, however, be\nsimply a negative after-image of the ordinary kind), and that on\nsummoning up a (hallucinatory) red flower in the crystal, she can see a\ngreen patch on the wall, or in another crystal. Or a blue picture,\nconjured up with closed eyes, on being transferred to the crystal,\nwould appear as orange. \" Or,\" she says, \" if I merely desire a change\nof colour in a crystal picture, I find that blue is followed by orange,\nyellow by purple, green by red. ... It may be worth noting that\na distinct effort is required to convert a scene\u2014lighted, for example,\nwith red\u2014to its natural colouring, or even to a neutral tint. It is\nl 2\n\f148 [chap.\nReport on the Census of Hallucinations.\nnecessary to close the eyes, or to look away for a moment ; so that\nwhat follows is a second edition rather than a prolongation of the first\npicture. On the other hand, the mere desire for change will produce\na green light rapidly alternating with the original hue.\" (Op. cii.,\np. 487.)\nOur general conclusion, then, is that the phenomena of hallucination\ndo not require, nor in any degree support, the difficult physiological\nhypothesis of retinal action. It is simpler to suppose that hallucinatory\npercepts, being subjectively indistinguishable from those produced by\nreal objects, involve cerebral activity closely similar to that normally\nexcited by visual impulses from the retina, and thus tend to be followed\nby cerebral exhaustion\u2014similar to that resulting from such retinal\nimpulses\u2014and consequently by similar after-images.\nIt should be observed that the activity involved is no less purely\ncerebral if, as we are inclined to think, in many of the cases we have\ngiven, expectation is, in whole or in part, the real cause of the\nphenomena. Expectation can hardly be excluded in the case of\neducated observers, when their attention has once been called to\nthe possibility of producing the complementary colours. Again, the\nactivity also remains cerebral if, as is further possible, the sequence is\ndue to another cause, namely, that the mind being weary of seeing one\ncolour, consciously or unconsciously attempts to call up for a relief the\ncomplementary colour, because it is accustomed to associate this sequence\nwith the idea of relief. Thus \"Miss X.\" found that the mere desire\nfor change in her crystal pictures would sometimes produce a green\nlight rapidly alternating with the original hue\u2014green being the colour\nmost restful to the eyes and therefore perhaps, by association, to\nthe mind.\n\fviil] Age in Relation to Hallucinations. 149\nChapter VIII.\nAGE, SEX, HEREDITY, NATIONALITY, anD HEALTH.\nRECURRENT HALLUCINATIONS.\nAge.\nThe ages at which the hallucinations included in our Census\noccurred, range from about three to about eighty years, and there is no\nreason to doubt that hallucinations may occur at any age at which\nvisual perception is possible at all. Nor does there seem to be any\nmuch greater disposition to hallucinations at one age than at another,\nthough it will be seen from the last line of Table XI that the propor\ntion seems to be somewhat higher between 20 and 30 than at other\nages. It is noticeable that this is the period of life when the organism\nhas reached its full development, but has not yet begun to decay.\nAs already stated, however, in Chapter III, pp. 65 and 68,we believe\nour information to be specially defective as regards the number of\nhallucinations at early ages, so that the small proportion of youthful\nhallucinations reported cannot be taken as evidence that hallucinations\nare rare in early youth. Indeed, it is, of course, impossible to know\nmuch as to the nature and frequency of hallucinations among young\nchildren. Their memory, and in some respects their observation, is\nuntrustworthy, and when they are too young to express themselves,\nevidence about their hallucinations\u2014like that about hallucinations\nsupposed to be experienced by animals\u2014can only rest on the inferences\nof others from their actions. Still, there are clear cases of halluci\nnations being experienced by children, and some observers have even\nbeen disposed to think that children are specially liable to them.\nAn instance of an apparition of a person recently dead being seen\nby a child just under two years old is recorded in the Annates des\nSciences Psychiques (January\u2014February, 1894, p. 7). This is perhaps\nthe earliest age at which such a case has been authenticated.\nAs regards the kinds of hallucinations experienced by children,\nwe have only noticed one peculiarity, and that is the relative\nfrequency among them, compared with adults, of apparitions repre\nsenting grotesque or fanciful objects.1 Of the apparitions in the\npresent collection classed as \"grotesque, horrible, or monstrous,\"\n1 The following is a rough analysis of the hallucinations of this class included in\nour Tables :\u2014\nChildith caici.\u2014Diminutive figures of men or animals, often \"swarming,\"\n5 cases.

[chap.\nmore than half occurred to children, and 12 out of 33\u2014or 36 per\ncent.\u2014to children under 10 years old, whereas of all kinds of visual\nhallucinations together, only 8 per cent. occurred to children under 10.\nThe reason, doubtless, is that children's judgment of what is likely\nto occur is less clearly formed ; they do not instmctively draw the same\nline between the expected and unexpected that adults usually draw.\nThe same difference is shown in ideas that do not develop into halluci\nnations. An imaginary lion under the bed is a source of infantine\nterror, but similar nervousness in a grown-up person suggests that there\nis a burglar there. In dreams, when our judgment is more or less in\nabeyance, and in delirium and insanity, hallucinatory figures unlike\nreal life are apt to occur to adults, just as they seem to do in ordinary\nlife to children.\nThe following are instances of youthful hallucinations :\u2014\n(360. 18.) From Mr. H. C.\nJugitst 31sf, 1890.\n\" When at Wells, being at the time a schoolboy, I followed a party of\nfriends to see the Cathedral. I was detained by work a few minutes, and\nran after the party. On entering the Cathedral I found it quite empty, my\nfriends, I fancy, having gone up the tower. I heard a noise, and looking up\nsaw a figure, dressed in the armour of a halberdier, moving along the\ngallery above the arches of the nave. The apparition was only momentary.\nThis occurred about the year 1865. I was aged about ten.\"\n(324. 12.) From Mr. W. K.

January 23rd, 1891.\n\"Long ago, certainly more than fifty, probably nearly sixty, years\nago, when I was a boy\u2014so young that I slept in a little bed in my father and\nmother's room\u2014I was lying awake one summer morning, and there I sud\ndenly saw on the ceiling of the room a procession of white cocks.

They glided backwards in single file along the roof before\nmy eyes, and disappeared, one after another, behind the curtain of my\nmother's bed without making any motion, except that each cock, just before\nit disappeared, went through all the motions of crowing, but emitted no\ntound. There must have been from 8 to 12 of them, and when the last of\nthem disappeared behind the curtain I saw them no more. I knew per\nfectly well that they were not there, that they were what I should now cull\noptical delusions, but I saw them as plainly as ever I saw a real fowl in my\nlife. I could recall them (\u00a3.*., their appearance) whenever I chose, just as I\ncan at the present day, but the difference between the image which I called\nup and the delusion which I witnessed was as great and as real to me as\nis the difference between the presence of a person and the image I form of\nhim in his absence. I was awed but not frightened at the sight, and said\nnothingabout it to my mother or to anyone, for I knew I should be checked for\ntelling a story. The procession lasted, I suppose, for about a minute, and I\nsaw nothing more that morning. I never saw these cocks again.\nNext morning I am quite sure I saw nothing at all, and perhaps for\nanother morning or two I saw nothing, but soon afterwards I began to see\non the ceiling great numbers of moving figures. The cocks which I saw\nwere associated in my mind with toy stucco cocks, which were sold in the\ncrockery shops, coarse clumsy things which had no proper legs, but stood on\na mass of stucco. My cocks were as perfect as nature, but they, too, had\nno proper legs ; they had a mass below their bodies, which supported them,\nand so I have no doubt that these toy-cocks were the basis of my vision.\nThe figures which I now began to see bore a great resemblance to another\nset of toys which I used to see in the shop windows\u2014i.e., pewter soldiers,\nhorses, gigs, &c, &c, but, unlike the toys, they were (like the cocks) per\nfect in form, coloured like nature, and moved naturally. The horses trotted,\nthe wheels turned round, the men walked, and so on. These I continued to\nsee in great numbers many days ; all dread and awe of them entirely dis\nappeared, and I became extremely interested in them, and liked to watch\nthem. One thing I remember ; I had not the power of controlling their\nmotions ; like my ships, they went about where they liked. They lasted in\nthe morning till I got up, and I never saw any during the day. I do not\nknow how long these visions continued ; certainly, however, for many days\nduring that summer, but, though I could, and even now can, recall their\nappearance completely, I never saw any more at any other time.\n\"I give you the history of this childish hallucination for what it is worth.\nI have often thought over it, and though it happened so long ago, I think you\nmay rely upon the absolute accuracy of my narrative.\"\n\" On reading the above to my son, a youth of 20, he told me an incident\nof his childhood, which I asked him to write out, and which I now enclose.\nHe was then a child in petticoats.\"\nThe following is the account referred to 1 :\u2014\n1 This case is not included in our Tables, as the percipient was under .21 at the\ntime the account was sent us.\n\f152 Report on the Census of Hallucinations.

Once during this time I was amused by seeing a number of\nlittle dogs, busily running in and out of holes they had made in the ground ;\nto me the sight was real, and exceedingly amusing. On another occasion I\nsaw, or believed I saw, the washhand-basin on the table close to the window,\nand a number of little men and women (black), about three inches high,\nrunning about and getting into and out of the water ; this lasted some time,\nto my great amusement, and seemed to me more real than the other, my\nrecollection of both being very distinct even now.

The last two of these are \" death coinci\ndences.\"\nInfluence of Sex on Hallucinations.\nIt appears from Table I. that 7-8 per cent. of the men, and 12*0\nper cent. of the women who have answered the Census question, have\nanswered in the affirmative. From this we may infer that, so far as\nour informants are representative, the number of men who experience\nsensory hallucinations and remember them is to the number of women\nwho do so in the ratio of nearly 2 to 3.\nMr. Gurney found that among 509 informants from whom he had\nreceived accounts of apparently subjective hallucinations of sight and\nhearing, the proportion of males to females was almost exactly 2 to 3,\nbut among the 527 percipients concerned in the hallucinations of sight\nand hearing which are included as telepathic evidence in Plumtasms of\nthe Living, about 46 per cent. were males and only about 54' per cent.\nfemales. (See Phantasms of the Living, Vol. II., p. 3, foot-note.)\nOur numbers are not exactly comparable to those of either of these\ntwo groups of Mr. Gurney's ; because (a) we do not know what was the\nproportion of men to women among the persons from whom Mr.Gurney's\ncases were drawn, and (6) our answers not only group telepathic and\npurely subjective hallucinations together, but are not limited, as his\n\fviil] Sex in Relation to Hallucinations. 153\nwere, to visual and auditory hallucinations. We have, moreover,\nreason to believe that Mr. Gurney had not, among his purely sulv-\njective cases, any of the trivial and doubtful experiences which, as\nwe have seen (Chapter III., pp. 64-66) form a not unSnportant per\ncentage of ours. But the general conclusion that women are more\nsubject to hallucinations than men, or remember them better, receives\nconsiderable confirmation from the fact that it holds in Mr. Gurney's\nmore selected types as well as in our wider collection.\nIn order to judge whether some kinds of hallucinations are specially\nfrequent among women, we have examined certain classes in detail.\nWe find that the visual hallucinations experienced by men within the\nlast 10 years amount to 18 per thousand of our male informants, while\nthose experienced by women are proportionately twice as numerous.\nAnd subdividing further, the preponderance of those seen by women is\nslightly greater among apparitions of living persons and incompletely\ndeveloped apparitions than among apparitions of dead or unrecognised\npersons. Of 40 cases of realistic apparitions of living and dead persons\nwhich appear to us doubtfully hallucinatory, 13 were experienced by\nmen and 27 by women.\nIf, going beyond the last 10 years, we take, either the 80 cases of\napparitions reported in the Census to coincide with the death of the\nperson seen, or the 130 hallucinations of all kinds reported to coincide\nwith the death of an absent friend, we find that 44 per cent. of these\nare reported by men and 56 per cent. by women,\u2014proportions not very\ndifferent from those found in Phantasms of the Living (see preceding\npage),\u2014so that, relatively to other hallucinations, men report a large\nproportion of these.\nMen appear to forget their hallucinations more rapidly than women,\nat least so far as the visual hallucinations within the last 10 years are\nconcerned. Within the most recent year, men report 35 visual\nhallucinations, or 4-2 per thousand, and women 52, or 6-0 per thousand.\nBut for the previous year the men report 18, or only half of their\nnumber for the most recent year, and the women 39, or three-fourths\nof theirs ; and the average annual number from five to ten years ago is\n11 for the men and 24 for the women.\nIt may be interesting to consider, in connection with the\npresent section and the last, the conclusions arrived at by Mr. F.\nGalton, in his Inquiries into Human Faculty, as to the variation of\nthe power of visualising in the two sexes and at different ages ;\nalthough, as before remarked (see p. 92), it has not been shown that\npersons who have strong visualising power are specially liable to see\nhallucinations. Mr. Galton's view is that there is no necessary con\nnection between the vividness of dreams and the power of visualisation\n(Op. ext., p. 97); and dreams are, in some important respects, analogous\n\f154 Report cm the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nto hallucinations. (See Plmntasms of the Living, Vol. I., pp. 296-\n297 and 389-391). Mr. Galton says (Op. eit., p. 99):\u2014\"The power\nof visualising is higher in the female sex than in the male, and\nis somewhat, but not much, higher in public school boys than\nin men. After maturity is reached, the further advance of age\ndoes not seem to dim the faculty, but rather the reverse, judging from\nnumerous statements to that effect; but advancing years are some\ntimes accompanied by a growing habit of hard abstract thinking, and\nin these cases\u2014not uncommon among those whom I have questioned\u2014\nthe faculty undoubtedly becomes impaired. There is reason to believe\nthat it is very high in some young children, who seem to spend years\nof difficulty in distinguishing between the subjective and objective\nworld. Language and book-learning certainly tend to dull it.\" The\nresults were similar in the cases of two special kinds of visualisation\ninvestigated by him, namely, the visualised forms associated with\nnumbers and dates, and the colours associated with letters\u2014 especially\nthe vowel sounds\u2014by certain persons.\nHeredity in Relation to Hallucinations.\nOur statistics are not calculated to give more than fragmentary\ninformation on the subject of the comparative frequency of hallucinar\ntions in different families, because in most cases we have no means of\nknowing whether our informants are related to one another or not.\nWe have, however, analysed such facts bearing on this subject as\nwe have been able to trace, with the following results :\u2014\n(1) Taking three generations of linear descendants into considera\ntion we find that in 34 families hallucinations have occurred in at\nleast two generations. In two of these families, a great grandparent\nhas had hallucinations as well. In three other families, both parents\nand two or more sons or daughters have had hallucinations.\n(2) In 41 families, hallucinations have been experienced by two\nbrothers, or two sisters, or one brother and one sister, or sometimes by\nmore than two members of the family of the same generation. In one\nfamily, two sisters, a father, grandfather, two uncles and two aunts\nwere all subject to visual hallucinations.\n(3) In 7 cases, hallucinations have been experienced by at least two\npersons related to one another as uncles or aunts to nephews or nieces,\nor as cousins.\n(4) In 3 cases, we are told that hallucinations have been experi\nenced by \" other members of the family,\" whose exact relationship to\nthe percipient is not stated.\nThough these numbers are not large in proportion to the whole\nnumber of persons included in the Census, still\u2014considering that the\ninformation about relationships has only come to us accidentally\u2014\n\fvia.] Heredity in Relntion to HfUlucinations. 155\nthey seem to afford some evidence that hallucinations tend to run in\nfamilies.\nThe numbers given above do not include hallucinations stated to\nhave been experienced simultaneously by members of the same family.\nThe following table shows the relationship to one another of the\npercipients in our first-hand cases of \" collective \" or joint hallucinatory\nperception.\nVisual cases.

From this large proportion of cases where the halluci\nnatory experience is shared with a member of the same family we\nmay perhaps infer that the similarity of temperament existing more\nor less in most families facilitates the sharing of the impression. It is\ntrue that most persons are probably more often in the company of\nmembers of their own family than of others ; but this hardly seems a\nsufficient explanation of the result in question, since it will be observed\nthat the hallucination is only shared by husbands and wives\u2014who are\nspecially likely to be in each other's company\u2014in 10 per cent. of the\ncases.\nWe think that the Census also affords some evidence that halluci\nnations running in families tend to take similar forms. It is possible\nthat this may in some measure be attributable to the influence of\nheredity, but, as was before suggested (see p. 126) it may be due to\nfamily tradition, moulding the ideas of the percipients. A lady\n(No. 671. 20) who has constant hallucinations, which generally\ntake the form of a yellow cat or black dog, tells us that the phenomenon\nis common in her mother's family. We are also told, by a collector,\nof a family, of which the members are said to see apparitions of a white\ndog, before a death in the family : several instances are mentioned, but\nthe percipients refuse to give any first-hand accounts.\n\f156 Report on the Census of Hallucinations.

The latter was at one time interested\nin Spiritualism, and exhibited an automatic capacity for drawing flowers,\netc., in which she had normally no ability at all. Later, circumstances\ndetermined her to have nothing more to do with the subject.\nThe following are accounts of similar \" grotesque \" apparitions seen\nat different times by two sisters when young children :\u2014\n(164. 20.) From Mrs. M. H.\n(The account was written in 1889.)\n\"About the year 1869,whilst lying in bed one morning (about 6.30 a.m.),\nwhen about 7 years old, I had a distinct impression of seeing a man dressed in\nEastern costume, with turban, flowing robes, and yellow slippers, standing\nat the side of the foot of my bed. I covered my face with the bed-clothes,\nand then looked again, and the figure was slowly sinking down into the\nfloor. As far as I know, I was in a healthy state of body and mind. I\nnever saw the apparition before. My little sister and a nurse were in the\nroom, but asleep at the time. This was the only time I ever had such an\nexperience. My younger sister, at 4 years old, saw the same apparition, bat\ndid not tell me of it till after I had seen it. Her account exactly corre\nsponded with mine. I have been since told that there was at the time, in a\nloft close to my room, a Turkish sword, brought from Sebastopol by an\nuncle of mine. Might this have something to do with the apparition i \"\n(164. 24.) From Miss E. S.\n(The account was written in 1889.)\n\" When about 5 years old, I was lying awake in the dark one night, when\nthe door by the head of my bed opened, and a man in Eastern dress\n(turban and long flowing robe) came in ; he passed by me, and stood at the\n\fTin.] Heredity in Relation to Hallucinations. 157\nside of my sister's bed. I have an idea that he held something in his hand,\nbut whether it was a light, I do not know. I was perfectly well. The\nnurse and my elder sister [were present]. My sister saw a man answering\nto this description about a year and a-half afterwards in the daylight. I\nnever told anyone of the apparition till my sister spoke of it.\"\nIn this case the existence of the Turkish sword, brought by an\nuncle from Sebastopol, makes it possible that Eastern dress and\nmanners may have been specially interesting to the household, and\nthat conversation may have suggested the form of the hallucination to\neach percipient.\nIn the following case there is evidence of a similar figure being\nseen independently by percipients of three generations, which seems\nto indicate a hereditary tendency to see apparitions\u2014though this, no\ndoubt, is not a complete explanation of the phenomena as reported.1\n(483. 10.) From Mr. T. A. Quin.\nOctober 24th, 1891.\n\"I saw a nice gentlemanly-looking young man in evening clothes, in the\nhouse I live in, for many years, at different hours of the night and day,\nand in various parts of the house. I was sometimes in bed and sometimes\nabout the house, in my usual state of health, and with no grief or anxiety to\nagitate the mind ; from under thirty [upwards]. The man had been dead\nmany years before I was born ; my father knew him when alive. On some\noccasions others were present, but did not see him. I saw him often.\n\"T. A. Qriu.\"\nMrs. Quin writes :\u2014\n\" With regard to the apparition seen by Mr. Quin, my husband, I will\nwrite down all I have heard about it. To begin with,the house is situated on the\ntown lands of ; the estate belonged to a family named F., the male mem\nbers of which have all died out, and it has gone in the female line. The\nlast survivor of the brothers, Tom, lived at \u2014\u2014 House, and I have been told\nby two ladies who were acquainted with him during his lifetime and while he\nlived in the place, that he himself often saw a gentleman about the house,\nbat he never saw his face. He died in London of consumption ; my\nhusband's father afterwards took the house, and one night he woke up and\n\u00bbaw Tom F. standing by his bedside ; he tried to wake his wife (from\nwhom I heard the story) but could not succeed, and told her the next\nmorning what he had seen. I am not sure if the ghost ever appeared to him\nagain, but his wife's brother, who lived with him, one evening before dinner\nturned into a bedroom which had been prepared for a guest to see if it was\nall right, and saw a gentleman either sitting or standing before the fire ;\nthinking it was the guest expected, apologised for his intrusion and left the\nroom. When he went downstairs, he found my father- and mother-in-law\n1 The eridence for what is commonly called \" haunting \" will be discussed in\nChapter XVI.\n\f158 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nwaiting for dinner and wondering why so-and-so was so late. ' Why,' said\nMr. 8., 'I saw him in his room just now,' and they said he must have\nbeen mistaken as he had not arrived at all. He persisted that he\nhad seen and spoken to him, so they went upstairs and found there\nwas no one in the room. After my father-in-law's death, other\ntenants took the house, and the daughter of the people who had it\nbefore my husband took it told me some time afterwards that none of\ntheir people had ever seen or heard anything there. My mother-in-law\nnever saw anything in the house. When my husband decided upon taking\nit, he was very anxious to know what his father had seen, but his mother\nwould not tell him. At the same time she said, if he ever did see anything\nafter living there, and would write and tell her what it was, she would then\nlet him know what his father had seen. After being in the house a\nshort time, he was in bed one night, having locked the door, a bright fire in\nthe room. He suddenly saw a gentleman standing by his bedside, dressed\nin evening clothes. It was the time of the Fenian rising, and, being almost\nalone in the house, he had a loaded pistol under his pillow, which he at once\ntried to feel for, thinking someone had got into the house, but he saw the\nfigure gradually moving towards the door, when it disappeared suddenly.\nHe wrote the next day to his mother, describing exactly what he had seen,\nand she answered back it was exactly what his father had seen. He was\nonly two years old when his father died, so he could have had no recollec\ntion. He often saw the same figure afterwards, at different times of the day,\nand in different parts of the house. I lived there after I was married for\nsixteen years, and never saw anything, nor had I any trouble about\nservants, though the house had always the reputation of being haunted,\nand I have been about the house all hours of the night. My eldest\nson, when he was little, slept in his crib beside my bed. [Being] subject to\nasthma, he was suffering one night, and could not Bleep. At last I thought\nhe had gone off, and was trying to sleep myself, but, after some time, I heard\nhim awake, and spoke to him. 'I thought you were asleep, my pet?'\n' No, mamma ; a man's face has been looking at me.' 'You are dreaming,\nmy darling.' 'No,' he said 'and there it is again,' and he got rather\nfrightened and clung to me. His father next day was asking him about\nhis dream and what he saw ; he said it was a man's face, with hair on it.\n' Was it a beard ? ' ' No, only side whiskers,' and that was the same kind of\nface he himself saw. The child was very young, and has no recollection of\nit at all, as I never reminded him about it ; nor while we were in the\nhouse did I allow the children to hear of the ghost, or be told about it.\nSince we left it a gentleman took it, and he said he never saw anything,\nand I hear the family who are living there now say they never have seen\nanything.\"\nIn another case (No. 563. 24.) a girl of about 18 saw an apparition\nof herself, apparently standing before a mirror. She was living at the\ntime with an aunt, who had, as a girl, twice had an experience of the\nsame kind, the apparition representing herself. In another case\n(No. 545. 18.) the percipient was awakened by a crash and saw a large\nball of fire, which seemed to light up the room, at her bedroom\n\fVIII.] 159\nNationality and Hallucinations.\nwindow, on the night of her mother's death. The latter is said to\nhave had a similar hallucination at the time of her husband's death by\ndrowning.\nNationality in Relation to Hallucinations.\nTable IX. gives what information we have been able to gather from\nthe Census as to the influence of nationality on hallucinations. As\nwill be seen, the great majority of the persons\u2014nearly 16,000 out of\n17,000\u2014included in the Census are English, or, at least, English-\nspeaking, a few Americans, as well as Australian colonists, being\nincluded in the English group. The next largest group is Russian,\ncollected chiefly by Mr. Aksakoff, either personally or through friends;\nthe Brazilian collection is due entirely to the efforts of Professor A.\nAlexander. The remaining section consists of collections made in\nvarious countries,\u2014Austria, Germany, France, Italy and Sweden\u2014\nthe total numbers being so small that it seemed best to group them\ntogether. It is probable that a few foreigners are also included in the\nEnglish group, but the great bulk of this is certainly English.\nThe relative proportions maintained within the groups are similar\nthroughout. In each, a larger proportion of women than of men\nanswer the Census question in the affirmative, and in each the visual\nhallucinations are the most numerous, and the tactile least so. Still,\nvery striking differences are seen in comparing the groups with one\nanother. Taking the first three sections,1 the Brazilian percentages of\naffirmative answers and of hallucinations are highest throughout, being,\nroughly speaking, between two and three times as high as the English,\nwhich are the lowest in every respect. The Russian percentages are\nalso considerably higher than the English.\nAnother noteworthy feature is the large proportion among the\nforeigners, as compared with the English, of hallucinations affecting\nmore than one sense. These amount to 39 out of 160 described\nexperiences, or 24-4 per cent., among the Russians ; 21 out of 93, or\n22 6 per cent., among the Brazilians; and 176 out of 1,675, or 10-5\nper cent., among the English.\nHealth in Relation to Hallucinations.\nIt was important to enquire to what extent the hallucinations\nincluded in the Census could be regarded as due to ill-health, and\ntherefore one of the questions put to all percipients was, \" Were you\nout of health ? \" But as our desire was, not to investigate experiences\nof delirium or insanity, but to confine ourselves to hallucinations\n1 The last Bection is anomalous in several respects, but the number of persons\nin it u so small that we should not be justified in drawing conclusions from it.\n\f160 Report on the Census of Hallucinatimis. [chap.\noccurring to persons in a normal condition, we stated, in the instruc\ntions to collectors on the back of Schedule A, that \" the question should\nnot be asked of persons who are known to have been at any time\ninsane, and it is not intended to include experiences of delirium.\"\nOf all the hallucinations eoming within the scope of the Census\nquestion, of which we have first-hand accounts, a certain degree of ill-\nhealth is reported in 146 cases. All these cases were carefully con\nsidered, Dr. Myers giving special attention to their medical aspect, so\nfar as this could be judged of from the information given.\nIn 23 of them, the hallucination took place in a state of illness\nwhen delirium is known to occur frequently, e.g., in scarlet or typhoid\nfever, or in a state of temporary injury to the brain, e.g., from a fall\non the head. In these cases it may well be supposed to be due exclu\nsively to a morbid physical condition ; these 23 hallucinations are\naccordingly not included in the Tables,1 and the persons who\nexperienced them are counted as having answered \" no \" to the Census\nquestion, unless they have had other hallucinations when in good\nhealth.\nIn the remaining 123 cases,2 though morbid conditions may have\nhad something to do with producing the hallucinations, it is so\nmuch more doubtful than in the 23 already mentioned that we have\nthought it better to retain them. Of the first-hand cases included\nin the Tables, therefore, there was a certain degree of ill-health in\nrather over 7 per cent. In 21 of them the percipient was in a state\nof convalescence after some illness,\u2014the nature of which is not always\nspecified, but which was apparently acute,\u2014or recovering from a\nrecent operation, or on the verge of a severe illness. In 55 cases the\npercipient was in a state of depressed health or minor illness\u2014e.g., \" in\na nervous dyspeptic condition,\" \"in a very low state of health,\"\n\" bronchitis with weakness of heart \"\u2014the condition being one with\nwhich hallucinations are not supposed to be generally associated,\nthough it may have rendered the patient more liable to them than a\nperson in normal health would be. There remain 47 cases of still\nslighter indisposition than the above, such as being \" a little. below\npar, and somewhat nervous and excited,\" where it seems very doubt-\n1 Three second-hand cases are also excluded from the Tables on the same ground.\nOf the 23 first-hand cases, 7 are apparitions of living persons, including 2 representing\nthe percipient himself ; 1 is an apparition of a dead person, and 2 of unrecognised\npersons; 3 belong to the class of \"grotesque, horrible, or monstrous apparitions\";\nand, of the remainder, 6 are visual hallucinations of other kinds and 4 are auditory\nhallucinations.\n2 In 20 of these cases there was a certain degree of anxiety or mental distress as\nwell as of ill-health. The possible effect of such emotional conditions in producing\nhallucinations is discussed in the next Chapter.\n\ftiii.] Health in relation to Hallucinations. 161\nful whether the physical condition had any share in producing the\nhallucination.\nIn 780 first-hand cases (that is, 48 per cent.), no statement at all is\nmade as to health. The assumption in these cases is that the per\ncipient was in good health. Often it is clearly to be inferred from all\nthe circumstances stated. And as the question, \" Were you out of\nhealth ? \" was put to all the percipients, they would probably have\nanswered it if they had been so. Considering the extremely slight\nnature of many of the ailments that were mentioned, it seems that the\ntendency was rather to exaggerate than to overlook any possible con\nnection that there may have been between the hallucination and the\nstate of health at the time. Some persons appeared anxious to show\nthat their hallucinations were due to their state of health, even if they\ncould not point to any other symptom of ill-health than the hallu\ncination itself.\nIn 719 first-hand cases, that is, about 44 per cent., a positive state\nment is made that the percipient was in good health at the time.\nOn the whole, therefore, it appears that, in the great majority of\nhallucinations included in the Census, there is no reason to think\nthat the physical condition of the percipients was in any way morbid.\nNo symptom of disease appears, unless the hallucination itself is to be\nregarded as such, which is not the view now generally taken by the\nmajority of competent observers familiar with the phenomena of\nhypnotism.\nIn considering the kind of hallucinations that occur during ill-\nhealth, it is convenient to take the whole number, whether excluded\nfrom the Tables or not, into account. Dividing, according to the sense\naffected, the 1 46 first-hand cases in which any degree of ill-health is\nmentioned, we find that 106 are visual hallucinations.. 28 auditory\nand 12 tactile. In this respect, therefore, the proportions are not\nmarkedly different from those in the whole collection. The proportion\nof realistic human apparitions (69 out of the 1 06 visual cases) is,\nhowever, distinctly small. And the non-realistic apparitions include\na disproportionately large number (namely, 9), of grotesque, horrible,\nor monstrous apparitions.\nThe following are two cases of hallucinations occurring during ill-\nhealth :\u2014\n(112. 22.) From Mrs. Girdlestone.1\nJanuary, 1891.\n\" I felt, more than I saw, many animals (principally cuts) passing by me\nand pushing me almost aside, as I went downstairs in broad daylight in our\n\u25a0The kind and degree of illness in this case was judged to be sufficient to exclude\nit fromthe Tables.\nM\n\f162 [chap.\nReport on the Census of Hallucinations.\nhouse at Clifton during several months in 1886 and 1887. Also often during\nsame period, and even now occasionally, I saw and see frightful faces ; only\nfaces, no other part of the body ; faces of no one I ever met in life, and faces\nmade hideous through terrible disease. I might be walking, or reading, or\ntalking. Occupation had no effect, neither time of day. In 1886 and 1887\nI suffered from overwork (mental) ; I was always conscious that the sights\nwere illusions, except for the animals pushing me, or perhaps a shadowy\nshapeless form, from which I suffer still, though quite well. [This happened]\nmany times ; and. as remarked above, I still feel in broad daylight as if\nsomeone or something pushed past me ; so much so that I invariably go\naside to let pass whatever seems in the way, though realising almost\nimmediately that there is nothing. Opiates act most quickly and peculiarly\nupon me. 1-16 of a grain of morphia given by the mouth makes me lose for\nsome hours my sense of identity. Belladonna plaster on the back invariably\ncauses many cats to swarm around me.\"\n\" In the summer of 1870, after very prolonged intellectual exertion, and\nwant of sleep, when the strain was over, and I was in a state of exhaustion,\nI was conscious of elaborate music being played, and forms moving in and\nout of the room, of the unreality of which I was well aware. The impres\nsions persisted for some hours, and were only removed by a deep sleep. [I\nhave] only once [had such an experience].\"\nIt will be observed that these hallucinations are of quite a different\ncharacter from the majority of those reported to us, being more\ncomplicated and dream-like. In this respect, they have some\nresemblance to the visions produced by opium, hasheesh, and other\nsuch drugs, which are frequently very complicated, as well as pro\nlonged (e.g., a case quoted by Professor James, Principles of Psychology,\nVol. II., p. 121). Several hallucinations of this kind occur among\nthose accompanying some degree of ill-health, but none in the rest of\nour collection.\nSome other cases of hallucinations occurring to percipients in more\nor less abnormal physical conditions are given as illustrations of other\npoints, e.g., Nos. 546. 19., 49. 5., and 460. 14. (see pp. 119, 142, and\n103). For another case, see Appendix E.\nNumber of Persons who have had more than one Hallucination.\nIn Table III. the noteworthy fact appears that, of the persons\nincluded in the Census who have experienced hallucinations, only 34\nper cent.,\u2014427 out of 1 249,\u2014of those who give first-hand accounts hav\u00ab\nhad more than one such experience. Table III. also shows that there\n(13. 5.) From Mr. J. S. R.\n(The account was written in 1889).\n\fVIII.] 163\nRecurrent Hallucinations.\nis a good deal of variety in the experiences of these persons, both as to\nthe kind and as to the number of their hallucinations : nearly half of\nthem have only had visual hallucinations ; about a quarter have only\nhad auditory hallucinations ; and a few only tactile. Nearly a quarter\nhave had hallucinations, some of which affected one sense and some\nanother. As to the number experienced, about half the percipients\nreport themselves to have had several or many hallucinations, but do\nstate the exact number ; rather more than a third of them have had\nonly two hallucinations; the remainder have had numbers varying from\nthree to six.\nWhen several hallucinations are experienced by the same percipient\nthey are in some cases scattered throughout his whole life, or a long\nperiod of it, and in others, even when numerous, they are confined to a\ncomparatively short period. As a specimen of the former kind\ndescribed by an exceptionally intelligent witness, see the case of\nMrs. D. (Appendix D), also No. 422. 22 (Mr. Mamtehitch's case in\nChapter XVII). Instances of the latter kind are Nos. 327. 25\n(p. 196) and 488. 14 (p. 353). Again, while in most cases the\nsuccessive hallucinations are apparently quite miscellaneous, in\nothers they show a more or less marked tendency to repeat them\nselves, the same hallucination recurring again and again. We find\n71 cases of this kind of recurrence in visual hallucinations. By\n\" recurrence \" we do not mean necessarily an exact reproduction, but\nthat the general resemblance is enough to make the percipient regard\nthe successive hallucinations as representing the same person or thing,\nor, in the case of animals, the same species of animal. Thus, in No.\n37. 13, the percipient was wakened by clothes falling off her bed, and\nsaw a figure in profile, with a lilac print dress and white apron,\nstanding at the other end of the room. On another occasion she\nwas wakened by feeling her hand clutched, and saw a figure of a\nwoman in a similar costume facing her. Here the general resemblance\nwas enough to make the percipient regard the figures as representing\nthe same person. Again, in No. 280. 20, the percipient saw the face\nof his brother in a wide-awake hat look in at the door of his room in\nthe evening. The same night he woke and saw the upper half of his\nbrother standing by his bed, looking at him. We count both these\ncases as recurrent, in spite of the slight differences between the impres\nsions on the different occasions. In most of the recurrent cases, the\nvarious appearances seem to have resembled one another more closely\nthan in these.\n\f164 Report on the Census of Hallucinations.

Of the 106\nvisual cases reported to us in which the percipient was in ill health, 16,\nor 15 percent, were recurrent. It should be said that 7 of these are\namong the 19 cases which seemed so clearly due to ill-health that we\nhave excluded them from the Tables ; but recurrence is also found in\nover 10 per cent. of the remainder, whereas, of all the visual cases in\ncluded in the Census, only 71, or 5-5 per cent., were recurrent.\nThe connexion between recurrence and ill-health is less marked in\nthe auditory and tactile cases. Of the 40 auditory and tactile cases\nreported to us as occurring during ill-health, 18, or 45 per cent.,\nwere recurrent, while of all the auditory and tactile cases included in\nthe Census, 181, or 36 per cent., were recurrent.\nWe have not included among recurrent visual hallucinations about\n20 cases in which a visual hallucination is repeated once or more\nwithin a very short period\u2014one or two days, at most\u2014because the\nphenomenon appears to be of a somewhat different kind from repeti\n\fVIII.] 165\nRecurrent Hallucinations.\ntions at longer intervals.1 It may be regarded as a single hallucina\ntion of more than average force and persistency, analogous to those\nvery rare cases where the hallucination continues for a long time\u2014 say,\nas much as half an hour\u2014 and it would be very difficult to draw the\nline between such cases and those where an apparition is seen again\nafter looking away from it, or after closing the eyes and then looking\nat it again. We have in No. 450. 18. (p. 234) a rather striking\ninstance of an intermediate kind.\nAnalogous auditory cases, which must obviously be regarded as\nsingle hallucinations, are those where the percipient hears himself\ncalled two or three times in succession.\n1 We have therefore, as stated on p. 52, counted these cases each as one halluci\nnation, unless there are some special features of difference between the different\nappearances, as in No. 280. 20, referred to on p. 163\n\f166 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nChapter IX.\nMENTAL AND NERVOUS CONDITIONS IN CONNEXION WITH\nHALLUCINATIONS.\nIn the last Chapter we have been dealing with general physical\nconditions, whose influence on the phenomenon investigated is, for the\nmost part, only statistically traceable. We now pass to consider, in\nthe light furnished by our statistics, certain conditions of the mind and\nnervous system, whose connexion with hallucinations is commonly held\nto be of a more direct and important kind. The chief of these are\nanxiety, grief, and the state of overstrained nerves which\u2014though it\nmay, of course, be an effect of prolonged or intense anxiety or grief\u2014\nmay also result from mere overwork and mental fatigue, when neither\nof the before-mentioned emotions is present. We shall treat the\nthree conditions separately, as far as possible: and shall begin with the\nstate of nervous overstrain, since in some cases\u2014where the overstrain\nhas gone so far as to cause illness\u2014its effects have already come under\nour notice 1 in the preceding chapter. Omitting cases where definite\nor permanent ill-health has been produced, the percipient states himself\nto have been\u2014at the time he experienced a hallucination\u2014overworked,\noverstrained, extremely tired, in a state of overwrought nerves, or in\nsome similarly described condition, in some 25 cases in the present\ncollection. . And, though not mentioned, it is probable that such over\nstrain existed in a certain proportion of 17 other cases where the\npercipient was in constant attendance on a friend or relative who was\ndying or very ill. In 8 of the 25 cases, a definite cause of anxiety\nis mentioned, and in 3 others, the percipient speaks of himself as\nworried.\nThe following is a case where the hallucination and overwork were\nclearly connected.\n(287. 1.) From Mr. W. H. F.\nJanuary 17th, 1890.\n\" I saw what seemed to be the end of a ladder placed against the\nlower part of my bedroom window.

Age 24-29. [The man was a] perfect stranger ; actions suggestive\nsimply of burglary. (N.B. I have never been in any house which has been\nburglariously entered.) The experiences [were] always exactly the same.\n[I] always regarded it simply as my sign that I was overworking. As soon\nas I could rest, the hallucination disappeared ; if I couldn't rest immediately,\nit apiieared Sightly.\"\nThe following is a case in which overwork seems mainly responsible\nfor the hallucination, but where its form was apparently determined\nby anxiety.\n(426. 13.) From Dr. A. H.\nNovember 22nd, 1891.\n'' Spring of 1880. I was seated in the train at Cannon Street Station,\nwhen a train drew up beside mine. In the carriage which stopped beside\nmine and in the seat nearest to me was seated (as I thought) my brother\nLeslie. He was the sole occupant of the carriage. I let down the window\nof my carriage, knocked at his carriage window, and otherwise tried, without\nresult, to attract the man's attention. [I was] extremely overworked ;\n[age] 24. My brother was in the West Indies. The last despatches spoke\nof yellow fever on board the ship, and other things which had made me\nanxious. He was not ill.\"\nOther cases where overstrain seems to be the probable cause of the\nhallucination, are No. 460. 14 (see p. 103) and No. 643. 22 (see p. 103).\nTo these may be added one or two cases\u2014not included in the numbers\nabove given\u2014where the percipient, being subject to hallucinations,\nfinds them more frequent in periods of overstrain : and we have also,\nof course, to take account of the cases where the overstrain has been\nallowed to reach the point of a breakdown of health.\nEffect of Emotion in producing llallucinations.\nWe endeavoured to obtain information as to the influence of\nemotion on hallucinations by asking all percipients whether they were\nin grief or anxiety at the time of the experience that they described.\nThe positive information given in answer to this question is no doubt a\ngood deal coloured by subjective bias ; for percipients will vary in\ntheir readiness or reluctance to give such information, and some will\nexaggerate, and others underestimate, the degree in which emotional\nagitation was really present. It is therefore l)est not to attempt to\ndecide what degree emotional disturbance ought to reach before it is\nreasonable to take it into consideration at all as a possible cause of\nhallucinations, but merely to draw such general conclusions as we\ncan from the cases where emotion is mentioned, or where the\n\f168 [chap.\nReport on the Census of Hallucinations.\ncircumstances seem to warrant the assumption that unusual emotion\nwas present.\nTaking all hallucinations, whether of sight, hearing, or touch, of\nwhich we have first-hand accounts, we find that anxiety, more or less\ngrave, about the illness of a relative or friend, is stated to have been\npresent, or appears from the evidence to have been probably present,\nin about 89 cases.1 In 54 other cases, we find mention of anxiety, or\nworry, or serious trouble about other subjects than illness,\u2014or at\nleast not stated to have been about illness. Then there are about 49\ncases, in which the percipient appears to have been in grief, or un\nhappy (besides some, already counted, in which he states himself to\nhave been in anxiety, as well as in grief) ; and if we add cases of\ndepression (5) and of agitation in various forms (23),2 we get altogether,\nout of 1,622 hallucinations, about 220 cases in which emotional dis\nturbance accompanied the hallucination. In 437 cases, a positive\nstatement is made that no grief or anxiety existed, and there seems\nto be no reason to suspect the presence of either in the great majority\nof the cases where no answer is made to the question about emotion,\nnor any information given bearing on the subject.\nIn 42 of the 49 cases of grief, it is due to the recent death of\nfriends; so that altogether anxiety about illness, or grief about death,\nwas present in 131 cases of hallucinations, that is, about 8 per cent., or\nnearly ^ of the whole number of hallucinations. It seems practically\ncertain that our informants have not, on the average, been in a state\nof anxiety about the health of their friends, or in grief for their\nrecent loss, during TV of their lives\u2014the period required to account\nby chance alone for the number of hallucinations occurring under\nthese circumstances : at first sight, therefore, it would seem clear that\nanxiety and grief did cause hallucinations. But further examination\nmakes it doubtful whether this inference from the facts is legitimate.\nIn 42 of the 131 cases the hallucination is stated to have occurred at\nthe moment of death, or within 1 2 hours (generally very much less) of\nit, the death being unknown to the percipient, and the hallucination\nconnected in some way with the decedent : and, in several other cases,\n1 We say \" about,\" because the extreme difficulty of deciding what the emotion\namounted to makes it desirable to regard the numbers we give as approximate only.\nWe include, among these 8!) cases, some where no anxiety is mentioned, but where we\nhave reason to think that the critical nature of the illness of a friend or relative was\nknown, or may have been known. In the case of an illness of long standing and not\nknown to be approaching a crisis, it is, of course, probable\u2014unless the contrary is\nstated\u2014that no special anxiety was felt.\n2 Some cases, in which seemingly small degrees of annoyance or agitation are\nmentioned by our informants, have been included in this number. The fact of their\nbeing mentioned has some tendency to show that more important degrees of emotion\nare not likely to have been passed over in silence.\n\fIX.] 16t)\nEmotional Conditions.\nthere is an element of coincidence suggesting a possible telepathic\nexplanation. In these coincidental cases, it would be begging the\nquestion to assume that anxiety about illness, or grief nlx)ut death, is\nthe sole cause of the hallucination ; and, if we omit these cases, those\nthat remain are hardly sufficiently numerous to afford a clear statistical\nproof of the tendency of these emotions to produce hallucinations.\nAt the same time, the general view that emotional excitement some\ntimes causes hallucination is supported by an examination of particular\ninstances which strongly suggest a connexion between the two ; but in\nthe best cases of this in our collection the emotion was different from\nthose just considered. The most undeniable instance is No. 733. 18\n(see p. 141), where a boy, who had received a shock from seeing a\ncorpse lying in an open coffin, afterwards saw an apparition of the\nsame figure : but the connexion between emotion and hallucination is,\nat any rate, highly probable in the following cases of hallucinations\noccurring during obvious and imminent peril of death.\n(34. 7.) From Mr. A. L.\n(The account was written in 1889.)\n\" When driving in the wilds of North Devonshire, the post-boy, in giving a\ngruel to the horse, took off the head collar in the road. The horse, startled, set\noff at full gallop with me in the gig, with only the reins holding to the rings\nof the collar. I said, ' Your life is sacrificed by the folly of a fool.' I heard\na voice distinctly say, ' No, it is in the hands of God.' [I was] in strong\nhealth [at the time]. No [other persons were present.]\"\n(453. 3) From Mr. J. L. C.\nSeptember 24th, 1891.\n\"When going from Glasgow to New York per Anchor steamer Enropa\non March 4th, 1871, we were overtaken by a severe storm, which somewhat\nalarmed all the passengers. At 10 o'clock p.m. we were startled by the\nnews that the bridge had been swept away, carrying with it the captain and\ntwo principal officers, who were lost. In the excitement, the vessel fell off\ninto the trough of the sea,which increased our fears. We were all gathered\ntogether in the cabin, the Doctor reading from the Prayer Book, as we\nthought our last hours were come. While sitting lonely and sad. thinking of\nmy loved ones at home, I lifted my head to look across the cabin, and saw,\nas I thought, my mother standing with my little boy waiting for me at the\nsea shore.1 I saw them very distinctly, just as I had seen them moving\n1 The collector writes :\u2014\"As I had previously heard the incident, there was no\nmention of 'sea-shore,' and 'waiting for me ' is plainly an inference, the clause being\ndoubtless innocently prompted by the hymn\u2014\n' We are watching by the river,\n' We are waiting by the shore.' \"\n\f170 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nabout before they died. My mother had died about a year before this, and\nmy boy about six months. Coming to me in this hour of deep grief, it\ngave me a thrill of real joy. The vision only lasted for a few moments.\nI was then 44 years old. About 20 were in the cabin, but no one shared\nthe experience ; [it] was personal to myself.\"\nCrises of this kind are brief and comparatively rare, so that we\nthink it reasonable to conclude that the hallucination did not occur\nthen by accident; and the intense emotional agitation connected with\nthe crisis seems the most probable cause.\nWe may add two other cases of less violent emotion.1\n(287. 15.) From Mrs. H. R.\n(The account was written in 1890. For another experience of the same\npercipient, see p. 201.)\n\" I was in bed, unable to get any sleep. I recollected a bad dream I bad\nhad in the same house, and a sudden feeling of fear of the invisible made me\npull the clothes closely round me. As I did so, I distinctly thought 1 heard\na voice behind me say, ' It is of no use doing that.' At the time I was so\nfrightened that I jumped out of bed and lighted a candle. This occurred in\nJuly, 1883. I was not in very good health at the time.\"\n(424. 7.) From Mr. C. H. G.\n(Late Senior Assistant Medical Officer at ).\nFebruary 17th, 1891.\n\"Quite recently, viz., two months ago, half an hour after retiring to\nbed, 9.30 p.m., when quite awake, I heard the captain of my ship, the\u00a3M*,\ncome into the cabin and ask for the key of the medicine chest. Upon\nenquiry next morning, I was informed that no such occurrence had taken\nplace. At the time I was to some extent suffering from mental worry,\nowing to an epidemic amongst my people, viz., 600 coolies. At the\ntime, the captain was in his cabin on the upper deck (mine being below)\nreading. No one [was] present at the time. [I have] only once [had\nsuch an experience.] Two nights later, the captain had a similar ex\nperience at about the same hour, and came out of his cabin imagining\nthat I had called him.\"\nThese cases, taken together, seem to show that emotion does to\nsome extent tend to produce hallucinations. There is no reason,\nhowever, to think it a very fruitful source of hallucinations, and\n1 In none of these cases, it will be observed, is there any expectation of seeing or\nhearing what is seen or heard. Cases where there is such expectation, even if acut\u00ab\nemotion is also present, cannot be regarded as necessarily due to the emotion, since\nthe expectation may itself produce the hallucination (see Chapter X).\n\fRe1xise and Abstraction. 171\ncertainly only a very small proportion of those in our collection can\nbe thus accounted for.\nRepose and Abstraction.\nThere is stronger statistical evidence tending to show that a state\nof repose is favourable to hallucinations. We find from Tables V.\nVII., and VIII., that in 38 per cent. of visual, 34 per cent. of auditory\nand 44 per cent. of tactile cases, the percipient was in bed, or (in a\nvery few cases) had been sleeping in his chair or elsewhere.\nConsidering what a small part of our lives we generally spend awake\nin bed, the fact that over i of the hallucinations occur under these\ncircumstances is certainly remarkable : and the proportion that occurs\nimmediately after waking\u2014about 12 per cent. of visual hallucinations\n\u2014is still more striking. We are inclined to attribute this result to a\ncombination of causes. In the first place, it seems probable that the\ntransition from sleep to complete wakefulness \u2014 and the transient\nstates intermediate between sleep and waking, which probably often\noccur during the times of general wakefulness in bed\u2014are not very\ndissimilar in their characteristics to the hypnotic condition, except for\ntheir extreme instability. Now the hypnotic condition is well-known\nto be one in which it is very easy to induce hallucinations of all\nkinds, and in which they sometimes occur spontaneously : we have\nobserved this several times with our own subjects, and it is probably\nfamiliar to all investigators of hypnotism.1 It must be remembered\nthat no experience occurring when the percipient does not believe that\nhe was fully awake is counted in our Tables ; but this is not incom\npatible with the supposition that the hallucination may sometimes\nhave begun when his state was verging on half-sleep and have roused\nhim completely before it vanished.\nIn some cases of hallucinations immediately after waking a some\nwhat different cause has operated,\u2014the influence of impressions from\nthe dream-world of complete sleep. We have already (Chap. IV., pp.\n71-2) given two instances of this\u2014besides a specimen of the seven cases\nexcluded from our Tables, in which dream-images or nightmares\npersisted into the waking state\u2014and the following is another example.\n(724. 3.) From Mr. B. L. L.\nApril 28<A, 1892.\n[We give an abstract of the original account, which was written in\nFrench.]\nMr. B. L. L. was French professor at the Ecole reale of \u2014, present age\n45. Towards the end of July, 1870, being at Paris, he dreamt vividly that\n1 For examples, see Mull's Hypnoliivi, English translation, pp. 177 and 17S,where\nhe refers to the observations of other experimenters besides his own.\n\f172 Report on the Census of HaUucinalions. [chap.\nhe went into his sister's house, and found her lying dead in a coffin in the\ndrawing-room. He woke and told a friend with him that his sister was dead.\nAt the same moment he heard \"ime voix m\u00e9lodieuse et qui n'avait riende\ncommun avec nos voix terrestres : ' Ladislas cheri, Ladislas cheri, Ladklas\ncheri ! ' \" (Ladislas being his Christian name). His sister died at the same\ntime. He knew that she was ill, but the last two letters he had had about\nher had said that she was convalescent. His only anxiety at the time was\nabout the approaching war with Prussia.\nWe add a peculiar and interesting case of a dream impression\nlasting into the waking state : though, as it failed to produce a sensory\nhallucination, it is not included in our Tables.\n(214. 19.) From Mrs. E. T.\nNovember 3r.l, 1889.\n\"[I was] awaked at night by my own voice, saying, 'Do not let him\nsleep ! ' and feeling agonised by seeing my son (who had gone out to British\nColumbia some weeks previously) lying exhausted on deep snow, a horse\nalso lying near him. [I] found myself walking the room, quite awake,\nimploring some one I could not see, iwt to let him sleep. [I] ascertained\nsome months later there had been this risk in travelling to a distant ranche.\n[I had] had much anxiety and grief ; [age] about 49. My son (only child)\naged about 28, was doing what is described, i.e., lying down exhausted in\nthe snow, but I could not prove that the exact time [corresponded]. My\nhusband was in the same room, but knew nothing of my experience, nor did\nI say why I called out ' don't let him sleep.' \"\nMrs. Sidgwick writes :\u2014\nDecember 16th, 1891.\n\"I have this afternoon seen Mrs. T. She seems quite clear that her\nexperience was not externalised. There was no apparition in the room with\nher\u2014nor vision that she saw with her eyes.\n\"It happened perhaps 5 years ago. She was very anxious about her son,\nwho was at the time going through dangers in crossing the Rocky Mountains\nand dangers in snow. But her vision gave her a quite definite idea of\ndanger from sleeping in the snow ; and this was not one that had occurred to\nher apart from the vision, because, as she said, ' it was such an absurd thing\nto do.' The son had had a very arduous day's journey and was utterly\nexhausted : but the smell of the interior of the Indian hut to which they\ncame was more than he could stand, and he lay down outside in the snow by\nhis horse, and fell asleep almost instantly. They dragged him into the hut\nat once, or it might have been fatal. Mrs. T. did not note the date, nor did\nher son, so the coincidence cannot be made out. She believes, however,\nthat there was one.\"\nAnother case where the connection between the dream and the\nhallucination that followed on waking seems to be clearly made out, is\nNo. 34. 20 (see p. 289).\nThe explanations above given, however, apply only to a portion of\nthe class which we are now considering,\u2014the hallucinations that occur\n\fSolitiule and Attraction. 173\nwhen the percipient is in bed. We are inclined, therefore, to think\nthat the mere absence of external distractions which is incident to rest\nin bed\u2014even when the person resting is in a condition of complete and\nprolonged wakefulness\u2014is in itself favourable to hallucinations. This\nsupposition seems to be supported by the fact that hallucinations occur\nmore in solitude than in company, as the following Table shows.\nVisual Hallucinations.\nAnalysed according to the condition of the percipient in respect of solitude.\n* Percipient\nalone.1\nOther persons\npresent. Unstated. Totals.\nPercipient in bed 318 \u00ab2 43 423\nup and indoors 261 147 30 438\n,, out of doors ... 103 98 \u2014 201\nUnstated ... 10 1 39 50\nTotals ... 692 308 112 1112\nFrom this it appears that 62 per cent. of the visual hallucinations\noccurred when the percipient was alone or practically alone.\nIt seems to us possible that the practice of crystal gazing may\npartly facilitate hallucinations by producing a state of quiescence\nand abstraction : and that the gazer may even sometimes pass into a\nsemi-hypnotic condition through keeping the eyes fixed on the same\nspot. Mr. Keulemans describes a condition of this kind as resulting\nfrom the concentration of his attention on one spot, during the process\nof drawing the eye of a bird (see Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VIII.,\npp. 517-519) ; and the experience of one of our percipients, No. 323. 22,\n\u2014who, when being photographed (and therefore with her eyes fixed)\n\" saw the bust and head of some one appear, who looked like a\nmusician \"\u2014is perhaps of the same kind. But, as was said in Chapter\nV. (p. 109), the 17 cases in our collection of apparitions seen in\nreflecting surfaces rather suggest that the crystal assists in the\nformation of hallucinations by providing convenient points de repere.\n1In the first column we have included cases where it seems probable from the\ncircumstances mentioned that the percipient was alone, though he does not explicitly\nstate it, and also cases where any other persons present in the room were asleep.\n\f174 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nChapter X.\nEXPECTANCY anD SUGGESTION.\nIn a variety of cases included in our returns, the expectation of a\ncertain sense-perception seems to have caused or facilitated the pro\nduction of a hallucinatory percept of the kind expected.\nThus there are in the Census 14 cases (13 of which were visual\nand one auditory), of phantasms of persons for whose arrival the\npercipient was at the moment looking out. The correspondence\nin these cases of what was seen or heard with the subject occupy\ning the percipient's thoughts seems so clear that we can hardly\navoid the conclusion that there was a causal connection between the\nstate of expectancy and the hallucination.\nThe following is an instance :\u2014\n(690. 1.) From Mrs. T. E.\n(The account of Mrs. E.'s experiences, some others of which are quoted\nbelow, pp. 186 and 333, was written by the collector, Mr. D. Fraser Harris,\nin April, 1890, and signed by Mrs. E.)\n\" This happened in 1870, when Mrs. E. was aged 40. She was sitting in\nthe drawing-room of a hotel overlooking a park, and was waiting for her\nhusband to take her down to dinner. The drawing-room door was open,\nand from her seat Mrs. E. had a view of part of the staircase and the inter\nvening hall or passage. He delayed coming, so Mrs. E. ever and anon kept\nglancing towards the door and out into the hall beyond. At last one time\nshe imagined she saw him turn a bend in the staircase and come slowly along\nthe corridor. Keeping her eyes fixed all the time on what she thought was\nher husband approaching her with a well-known smile, Mrs. E. rose and\ncrossed the room till she stood, as she thought, opposite her husband, when\nthe spectre vanished from before her eyes. She was in good health at this\ntime. In about half-an-hour afterwards, her husband, detained unavoidably,\ndid veritably come into the room.\"\nAnother kind of expectation, of which we have two instances in the\nCensus, occurs when a prediction is made through some automatic\nmeans at a spiritualistic seance that the alleged \" controlling \" spirit\nwill appear to one of the sitters as a test of identity. One of these\ncases, in which information unknown to the percipient and afterwards\nverified was given at the seances, was published in Proceedings S.P.R.,\nVol. VI., p. 351, and we give here an abstract of the percipient's\naccount in the other case.\n\fX.] 175\nExpectancy und Suggestion.\n(536. 25.) From Miss E. K. B.\n(Miss B.'s account was written on August 21st, 1889.)\nOn November 27th, 1887, while staying near Melbourne, Australia, Miss\nB. made the acquaintance of a lady, Miss L. T., who had the capacity of\nplanchette writing. A communication written through her, and signed by\nthe name of a well-known authoress, \" M. N.,\" stated that \" before another\nyear had rolled away, some gift of spiritual power would come to \" Miss B.\nMiss B. afterwards went to Otago, and on the evening of December 31st,\n1887, was persuaded by the friends with whom she was staying to try\nexlieriments in table-tilting. Miss B., remembering the prediction made\nthrough Miss T.'s planchette, wished to enquire further about it, and tho\ntilts indicating that \" M. N.\" was present, she asked when the \" gift \" would\ncome to her and what form it would take. The tilts replied that \" M. N.\"\nwould be able to make herself visible to Miss B. the same night. This\noccurred at 10 p.m. Miss B. states that she was not at all impressed by the\nincident and went to bed and to sleep without thinking about it. In the\nmiddle of the night, she woke suddenly and completely, with a curious\nfeeling of what she describes as \" inward shivering\" ; the room was quite\ndark, and she saw a tall white female figure slowly rising between the wall\nand her bed with its arms stretching out towards her. She turned away\nfrom it and saw it again after turning back ; it then seemed to disappear\nslowly into the floor. After a few minutes, she looked at her watch and\nfound it was 2.25 a.m. In the morning she told her host, who confirms\nher account.\nSix weeks later, Miss B. heard from Miss L. T. that she had been\nplanchette-writing with a friend at Melbourne on the evening of December\n31st, 1887. \"M. N.\" had communicated, but at 12.30 had said that she\n\" must go to \" Miss B. This time at Melbourne corresponds to about\n2.15 a.m. at Otago, the time when Miss B. saw the apparition.\nMiss L. T. writes on July 7th, 1889, giving an account of her planchette-\nwriting on the evening in question, and confirming Miss B.'s statements.\nExpectancy, of course, cannot account for Miss B.'s seeing the\napparition just at the time when the statement that \" M. N.\" would\ngo to her was written by the planchette ; but, in any case, it may be\nregarded as having facilitated the hallucination.\nIn the following case (received from Brazil) there was a general\nexpectation of seeing something, though there had been no suggestion\nthat it would be seen at any particular time.\n(730. 18.) From Mr. J. K.\nMarch 18th, 1892.\n\" I saw the form of a man dressed in a cap and blouse like those worn by\nFrench workmen. He entered my bedroom with a peculiar gait, more like\ndancing than walking. I heard him say, ' You wanted to know me. Here\nI am.' He came right up to the bed, and I could not help uttering a nervous\ncry. 'If you are afraid,' said the man, ' I will go,' and he immediately dis\nappeared. I am not quite sure of the date, but it must have been in '82 or\n\f176 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nthereabouts. It was past midnight. I was lying in bed smoking a cigarette.\nI am in the habit of smoking when I wake up at night. Health good. I was\nfeeling a little anxiety about the nervous state [into] which my wife had then\nfallen, and which I attributed to adverse spirit influence. My age in '82 was\n33. I had challenged the supposed influence some hours before to come to\nme, and I believe that it was in answer to this challenge that the form\nappeared.\n\" I was once reading aloud at a sitting when I saw a man leaning on the\ntable by my side, who interrupted my reading with the remark, ' I don't\nunderstand.' On looking round, I found he had disappeared, nor did any of\nthe others observe a person sitting in the place where I saw him. At another\nsitting, I was rising from my chair, when a heavy hand was laid upon my\nshoulder and forced me down again. Yet there was nobody behind me.\"\nIt is possible that habitual attendance at spiritualistic seances may\nlead in some persons to the seeing of apparitions and hearing of voices.\nIn one case, (No. 383. 1) the percipient, a working-man, reports several\nhallucinations, both visual and auditory, occurring in the course of a few\nmonths, and the collector\u2014himself a spiritualist\u2014suggests that this\nmay be the effect of the stances which he was accustomed to attend\nat that time.\nSuggestions by word or gesture from the other persons present.\nAn obvious cause of the expectation of a percept is suggestion,\nin some form, from another person : and the question whether halluci\nnations can be induced in persons in a normal waking condition by\nsuch suggestion is especially important in connection with the evidence\nfor shared or collective hallucinations ; since there are not many cases\nof collective hallucinations recorded in which it is quite certain\nthat suggestion by word or gesture from one percipient to the other\nwas excluded. But if this suggestion was the sole cause of the\nsharing of the hallucination in these cases, we should expect to find\nother cases where one person who is not experiencing a hallucination\nproduces one by verbal suggestion in some one else.\nNow it is well known that hallucinations may be produced in this\nway in hypnotised persons by suggestions given in the hypnotic state :\nand according to Bernheim (De la Suggestion, Chap. V.) they can\nsometimes be produced in persons \" hypnotisable, but in no way\nhysterical,\" even when they are in the normal condition, provided that\nthey have previously been hypnotised. We have heard, moreover, on\ngood authority, of an experimental case in which the effect was\nbrought about in a person not previously hypnotised and in a com\npletely normal state, by verbal suggestion of an insistent and emphatic\nkind : but we are not aware that any such case has been carefully\n\fX.] 177\nExpectancy and Suyyesti&n.\nobserved and recorded. And certainly no case clearly of this kind\nis included in our Census ; but in the two following, the collective\nnature of the experience is somewhat doubtful, and it seems, for\ndifferent reasons, specially likely that the hallucination was caused in\nthe percipient who describes it through verbal suggestion from her\ncompanion.\n(237. 13.) From Mrs. S.\nJanuary 3rd, 1890.\n\"I once fancied, or really saw, the shape of a woman by my bed.\nWhen about 16 years old, and sleeping with a lady some years older than\nmyself, she awakened me suddenly, asking if I saw anything, and I\nbelieved at the time that I saw a tall, grey figure, near the foot of the bed,\non the side farthest from me, but it did not make any serious impression\non me.\"\nHere the transition from sleep to waking is, as we have seen, a\ncondition favourable to hallucinations : and though the elder lady\nmust be taken to have seen something, there is no reason to suppose\nthat it was a tall grey figure.\n(536. 2.) From Miss J. S.\nAugust 9\/7i, 1891.\n\"In the year 1883, I was studying music, and used to practise alone fre\nquently in the evening. Towards the autumn of that year, on one occasion,\nI felt some one touch me, and on looking round I saw the figure of a gentle\nman whom I knew. He was dressed in black clothes, with the collar of his\ncoat buttoned closely round his neck, showing no white collar. As I looked\nhe faded away. This occurred on three different occasions. I was in perfect\nhealth at the time, and in no trouble or anxiety ; of full age. I had not\nseen the gentleman himself for about two years before that occurrence, and\nhave no idea what he was doing at the time. The two first occasions\nwere exactly alike. On the last occasion, a young girl was playing a duet\nwith me. She suddenly shuddered and said, ' I felt some one touch me.' I\nalso felt as if a hand touched my shoulder, and on looking round saw the\nsame gentleman.\"\nIn this case the other witness, on being applied to for confirma\ntion of her share in the experience, said that she did not remember\nanything about it. But even if Miss S.'s recollection is accurate, the\nsudden verbal suggestion, assisted by the traces of the two previous\nexperiences, is probably sufficient to account for the phenomenon on\nthe third occasion.\nThe possible efficacy of verbal suggestion in cases of collective\nhallucinations will be considered further when we come to deal with\nthese cases. (See Chapter XV.)\nN\n\f178 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nEffect of Xoises in Producing Hallucinations.\nIt appears in some cases that it is possible for a noise to induce visual\nhallucinations by creating in the hearer a strong expectation of seeing\nsomething corresponding to it or that may account for it. Dr. Moll\ngives a curious instance of a hypnotic subject of his, who when hypno\ntised was once much alarmed by a hallucination of a mad dog attacking\nhim; Dr. Moll observed that this recurred whenever one of the persons\npresent creaked his boots. {Hypnotism : English translation, p. 178.)\nHe gives some further instances of visual hallucinations in hypnotised\npersons following on some slight stimulus of the other senses ; e.g.,\nblowing with a bellows caused a hallucination of a train and railway\nstation (Op. cit., p. 196). But in the hypnotic condition, suggestibility\nto hallucinations is of course very much greater than in ordinary\nwaking life; and the cases just quoted are perhaps comparable to the\ninstances described by more than one psychologist,1 of dreams pro\nduced experimentally, e.g., by slight tactile stimuli, rather than to\nsensory hallucinations of persons in a normal waking condition. The\nfollowing, however, is a transitional case\u2014between dreaming and\nwaking\u2014in which the visual percept seems to be clearly dependent on\na real sound heard at the time or just before. It is quoted from\nP\/iantasms of the Living, (Vol. I , p. 474, foot-note). The percipient\nwrites :\u2014\n\" Between sleeping and waking this morning, I perceived a dog running\nabout in a field (an ideal white and tan sporting dog), and the next moment\nI heard a dog barking outside the window. Keeping my closed eyes on the\nvision, I found that it came and went with the bark'mg of the dog outside ;\ngetting fainter, however, each time.\"\nWith this may be compared the following case from Dr. G. J.\nStoney's paper, On the Limits of Vision, another 2 extract from which\nis quoted in Chapter VII., p. 141.\n\"Some years ago, a friend and I rode\u2014he on a bicycle, I on a tricycle\u2014on\nan unusually dark night in summer from Glendalough to Rathdrum. It was\ndrizzling rain, we had no lamps, and the road was overshadowed by trees on\nboth sides, between which we could just see the sky-line. I was riding\nslowly and carefully some ten or twenty yards in advance, guiding myself by\nthe sky-line, when my machine chanced to pass over a piece of tin or some\nthing else in the road that made a great crash. Presently my companion\ncame up, calling to me in great concern. He had seen through the gloom my\nmachine upset and me flung from it. The crash had excited the thought of\nthe most likely cause for it, and this involved a visual perception in the mind,\n1 See especially Maury, Le Sommcil et let Keren, p. 132, etc.\n4 See The Philosophical Magazine, March 1894.\n\fExpectancy and Suggestion. 179\nfaint. but sufficient on this occasion to be seen with distinctness when not\noverpowered by objects seen in the ordinary way through the eyes.\"\nIn the following case the form, at least, of the hallucination seems\nto have been suggested by the barking of the dog, though the coinci\ndence with the death points to the operation at the same time of a\nsupernormal cause.\n(562. 3.) From Miss Wharton.\n\" 12, Addison-terrace, Notting Hill, W., December 4th, 1891.\n\"I heard the voice of a friend saying to my brother-in-law, 'Please\nsilence your dog.'

[chap.\nrecognised) coming into this house, cross the hull just outside the room in\nwhich I was standing, and go upstairs. At the same time that I distinctly\nheard her going upstairs after having crossed the hall, I saw her in the room\nwhere I was. The room opens into the hall. I only saw her for a second or\ntwo ; and she had not on her hat and jacket as she would naturally have had\ncoming in from a walk, but was dressed as she usually is in the house. The\nappearance vanished almost at once. I was startled by it, and when my\nfriend came down I told her what I had seen, explaining that it must have\nbeen the sound of her step outside which caused the appearance. I had\nalso just come in from a walk, and was talking to other people in the\nsitting-room. I w:is not out of health nor in anxiety of any kind. Age 27.\nI was living in the house with the lady I mentioned. She certainly came into\nthe house at the time at which I heard her, but went straight upstairs and did\nnot come into the sitting-room.\"\nBesides the case just quoted, there are a large number of cases in\nwhich a visual hallucination seems to have been preceded by a noise.\nIn most of these cases, however, the noise is regarded as hallucinatory\nby the percipient, so that they are classed in Table II. as bisensory\nhallucinations, \" visual and auditory (non-yocal).\" But in the\nmajority of them, the hallucinatory character of the sounds seems to\nhave been merely inferred from the fact that they were unexplained,\nor from their association with visual hallucinations. Now, it is\nobviously difficult\u2014or in many cases impossible\u2014to ascertain of what\nnature these sounds were ; and we think it probable that in many cases\nthey may have been real sounds, due to unexplained physical causes.\nFor we find that when sounds of this kind are heard,\u2014e.g., in house*\nreputed to be \" haunted,\"-\u2014they are most frequently heard by every\none in the house, or in the part of the house that is associated\nwith them. Further, the assumption of their physical reality is not\nnecessarily inconsistent with our systematised experiences of matter.\nAn apparition which disappears in a clear space while being looked\nat, or passes through a closed door, is inexplicable as a part of the\nordinary external world ; but it is otherwise with these sounds.\nThey may be unexplained, but they cannot be regarded as strictly\ninexplicable. Another characteristic of them is that they recur very\nfrequently, to a degree that is extremely rare among hallucinations\nthat can be proved to be such.\nThese considerations apply with special force to cases where non-\nvocal sounds alone are heard, no sights, or other more definite\nimpressions, being associated with them. The uncertainty with regard\nto the nature of the sounds is then so great that we did not include in\nour statistical enquiry alleged hallucinations of this kind ; but the\nuncertainty remains in some cases when the sounds accompany\u2014and\nespecially when they precede\u2014visual impressions that are undoubtedly\nhallucinatory. There are 71 cases (see Table I) in our collection where\n\fX.] LSI\nExpectancy and Su\\fyeation.\na non-vocal sound is heard accompanied by a visual hallucination, and\niii 56 of these the sound precedes the apparition. It seems to us not\nimprobable that in many of these latter cases the sound was real and\nproduced in the hearer a state of expectant attention which led to\nthe visual hallucination. Instances of such cases are No. 68. 25\n(seep. 120) and the following.\n(023. 9.) From Mr. H. F.\nApril, 1892.\n\"I was, so far as I remember, nine years of age [i.e. in 1874]. I had just\ngone to bed. and was\u2014at least this was my impression at the time\u2014quite\nawake. The door of my room was ajar, and there was a light in the passage,\nwhich half illumined my room. Suddenly, I became aware of a series of\nslight taps on the passage outside. These taps were not sufficiently loud for\na human footstep : on the other hand, the volume of their sound was greater\nthan that made by a walking stick. I fully remember sitting up in bed and\nbeholding two top boots trot rapidly across the room and vanish into the\nopposite wall. The illusion was astonishingly vivid and I can recall the\ndetails to this day. I have never had a waking dream since, nor have I ever\nexlierienced ambulant top boots except on this occasion. \"\nAnother case where it seems especially probable both that the\nsound heard was a real sound, and that the hearing of it was the\noccasion of the visual hallucination that followed, is No. 733. 18\n(>ee p. 141), where a previous agitation had clearly predisposed the\npercipient to that particular hallucination. See also No. 284. 23\n(p. 73),where the sound of the \"bang\" was followed by the sight which\nthe percipient was accustomed to associate with it.\nIn other cases, a non-vocal noise, such as that of footsteps, leads up\nto a tactile hallucination (3 cases) or to the hearing of a voice (5 cases).\nIn considering how far the reality ef the sounds may be inferred\nfrom their being generally audible to every one within ear-shot of\nthem, we have examined the 56 cases where a non-vocal sound pre\nceded an apparition. We find that other persons were present in 19\ncases : that in 5 cases, all those who were present both heard and\nsaw the same ; that in 6- cases, the other persons had no share in the\nimpression ; but that in the other 8 cases, the sounds were heard by\none or more persons who did not share in the visual percept. In\nstances of this last kind are Mrs. Hall's case, No. 656. 26 (see\nchap. XVII.), and the following.\n(319. 1.) From Miss 0. E.\nJuly 4\u00abi, 1890.\n\"On January 11th, 1883, between 6 and 7 p.m., I was in the breakfast-\nroom of my home, when I heard my father insert his latch-key in the front\ndoor, open the door and knock his stick on the tiles in the hall, but did not\n\f182 Report on the Census of Hcdlucinations. [chap.\nhear him come up the hall. At the same time I saw his dog, a small Scotch\nterrier, pass the breakfast-room door, as though he had returned with my\nfather. He did not go into the dining-room, but toward the mat at the foot\nof the stairs. I was standing by the table with my face toward the open\ndoor, glancing into a book ; when I heard my father's key, I put down the\nbook and thus saw the dog. Living with my father, I saw both him and the\ndog constantly. It was his habit to go for a walk about that hour, but on\nthat day both he and the dog were dozing before the dining-room fire. The\ndining-room door was opposite that of the breakfast-room, but was fast shut\nI was alone, but an elder sister and a woman who sewed for her were in the\nhall and heard my father open the front door. They made no mention of\nthe dog, but were emphatic as to my father having entered the house. I have\nanother sister who remembers my elder sister, the woman, and myself all re\nlating the incident to her the moment it occurred.\n\" I ought to mention that directly my elder sister was told that my father\nhad not entered the front door as she supposed, she hurried into the dining-\nroom to convince herself that he was there ; and told him what had occurred.\nHe declared he had not left the room all [the] afternoon, and the dog had\nbeen with him.\"\nMiss. E.'s sister writes :\nDecember loth, 1890.\n'' In corroboration of my sister Miss C. E.'s statement, I remember the\nsewing woman and both my sisters telling me at the time, that my father\nhad entered at the front door, when at that moment he was asleep in the\ndining-room.\n\"H. G. E.\"\nLater she adds :\u2014\n\" I remember my sister C. telling me at the time she saw the dog cross\nthe hall.\"\nMr. Podmore writes :\u2014\nMarch 31s<, 1892.\n\"I called on Miss C. E. and Miss H. G. E. to day.\n\" Miss. C. E. explained that she distinctly heard the ' fuss ' of opening\nthe front door, (i.e. key in latchlock, etc.), and then tap of stick, and tiny\npatter of dog's nails on tiled floor. Then she saw the dog pass her\nin the hall\u2014a yellow Scotch terrier\u2014quite unmistakable in the full light of\nthe gas. Miss C. E. then went into the hall, and presently joined her\ntwo sisters Miss H. G. E. and Miss E. in the pantry with the work\nwoman referred to. She there learnt that Miss E. had just had a\nglass of beer brought to the workwoman in the hall. Mr. E. much\ndisliked anything being drunk in the hall, and probably the infringement of\nthe rule of the house made Miss E. a little apprehensive of her\nfather's return. Anyway, both she and the workwoman said that they\nheard his key in the latch and had run straightway into the pantry, meeting\nMiss H. G. E. on the way. Miss H. G. E. gave the fullest corroboration.\nShe remembered to have heard of the incident from both her sisters and\nfrom the woman (now dead I gathered). Miss H. G. E. was of opinion that\nMiss E. saw nothing, and Miss C. E. was inclined to agree with her.\n\fx.j Expectancy and Suggestion. 183\n\"It should be added that both sisters were of opinion that there was no\nreal sound to start the hallucination, but the house fronted on a public\nsquare, and it is clear that it would be very difficult to exclude the possibility\nof real sounds.\n\"Miss C E. was about 23 at the time. She has had no other\nhallucinations.\"\nBefore leaving this subject, it may be worth while to remark that\nthe spontaneous association of visual images with real sounds which\noccurs with some persons\u2014such as the \" number-forms \" described by\nSir. Galton and the phenomena of \" coloured audition \"\u2014sometimes\nseems to assume a hallucinatory form. The following is an instance\nwhich appeared originally in Nature of March 6th, 1890. The account\nthere given, which was written in May, 1889, has since been revised,\nwith a few additions, by the percipient, Miss G., whose later account\nwe quote. She writes :\u2014\nApril 12th, 1891.\n\"The sound of an oboe brings before me a white pyramidorobeli.sk,\nrunning into a sharp point ; the point becoming more acute if the note is\nacute, blunt if it is grave. The obelisk appears to be sharply denned and\nsolid if the note is loud, and vague and vaporous if it is faint. All the notes\nof the 'cello, the high notes of the bassoon, trumpet, and trombone, and the\nlow notes of clarionet and viola, make me see a Hat undulating ribbon of\nstrong white fibres. The tone of the hom brings before me a succession of\nwhite circles of regularly gradated sizes, overlapping one another. The\ngreater the intensity of the sound, the larger and more distinct the circles.\nThese circles and the ribbon float past me horizontally, but the point of the\nobelisk seems to come at me.\n\"In an orchestra, when the violins strike up, after the wind band has\nbeen prominent for a time, I see often but not always, a shower of bright\nwhite dust or sand, very crisp and glittering. I am taking note of the recur\nrence of this impression, and think it is becoming more frequent, but it is\nnot invariable like the others. [It is much more frequent now, 1891.]\n\"I have heard a great deal of orchestral music all my life, but I have\nonly noticed these effects for six or seven years. They gained gradually in\nfrequency and clearness, and now the first three are invariable.\n\"If I know the scoring of a piece well, the various effects dighlly precede\nthe sound of the instrument they belong to ; only the objects are vague and\nfaint till the sound begins. Sometimes, if an oboe passage has an intense\nand yearning character, the white point comes so near me, and moves so\nrapidly, that I think it must uvwul me.\n\"1 am very anxious to make it clear that I am not trying to describe a\nmental state by symbols, but that I actually see the point, the fibres, and the\ncircles. Generally they float half-way between me and the orchestra. They\ngive me great pleasure. If only one class of instruments is used, the effect\ndoes not extend beyond the opening bars : for instance, in a string quartette\nI only see the white sand for a moment at the beginning ; if, however, wind\nand stringed instruments are combined, I see the various effects again and\nagain in one piece. Lately (1891), the horn notes affect me so strongly that\n\f\u2022 184 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\ninstead of seeing a string or necklace of circles the air is full of them, like\nflakes in a snow-storm, and I have a swimming, giddy sensation.\n\" I am quite healthy and have always been so. I am 26J.\"\nOther Slight Impressions leading to Hallucinations.\nThe seeing of an apparition is sometimes preceded by slight or\nindefinite impressions, other than sounds. which often produce in the\npercipient an expectation of seeing something and by this means,\nperhaps, produce the hallucination. There is the same difficulty of\ndetermining whether these impressions are real or hallucinatory that\nwe have found in the case of sounds.1 The following is an instance\nwhere it seems very probable that the sensation described was produced\nby real movements.\n(726. 18.) From Mr. F. B.\nOctober 31s\/, 1891.\n\" When a boy I sometimes saw forms in the dark. In the province of C,\nof which I am a native, we sleep in hammocks. I felt the hammock quiver,\nand on looking would see a form standing by or passing under it. I attached\nno importance to this at the time. This [occurred] in C.,one of the Northern\nProvinces of Brazil. I ceased to see them some 24 or 25 years ago I was\nin good health and spirits. I was subject to these visions, to the best\nof my recollection, between my eighth and fourteenth or fifteenth year.7'\nIn about 14 cases, the seeing of an apparition is preceded by the\napparent opening of a door, through which the figure seems to walk\ninto the room. Here again, it is possible that the apparent movement\nmay occasionally be a real one, due to some ordinary cause, and that\nthe sudden expectancy which it produces may lead to the seeing of the\napparition. (See Miss E. L. T.'s case, No. 264. 23, Chap. XVI.). An\nindication of the efficacy of such a cause is to be found in an expression\nused in an account quoted in Chapter IV. (pp. 76, 77). The percipient.\nwho frequently experienced the hallucinations described, says, \" Often\nwhen a door is opened, they rush in, like messengers in haste.\" It\nwould of course be a proof of the reality of such a movement if the\nobject moved were found finally in a different place from where it was\nat first\u2014if the opened door remained open. In most cases, however,\nthe door appears to open and shut again, and then the most probable\ninterpretation would generally seem to be that the whole movement\nis part of the hallucination : though in Miss E. L. T.'s case, just\n1 In the discussion of the \"sense of presence\" in Chapter IV. (p. 85), it was\nsuggested that some impressions of this kind may be initiated by slight sounds or\nmovements of the air, etc. half consciously or unconsciously perceived ; but we have\nno positive ground for attributing the phenomenon to such a cause in any of the\n20 cases in the Census where the \" sense of presence \" precedes a fully externalised\nhallucination.\n\fExpectancy and Suggestion. 185\nreferred to, the fact that the opening and shutting appear to have beeu\nseen by two persons renders it probable that the movement was real.\nOther comparatively slight impressions leading up to more definite\nonesare when a touch is felt, preceding a visual hallucination (17 cases),\nor the hearing of a voice (7 cases). The following is an instance.\n(437. 19.) From Miss L. W.\nJulrj 7th, 1891.\n\" I felt a touch as of a hand laid on my shoulder, and, on looking up,\nsaw a girl whom I had not seen, and of whom 1 had not heard, for about\ntwo years. Place : at my own home. Hour : about 4.30 p.m. [I was]\noccupied in shading a drawing ; was in perfect health, with no grief or\nanxiety ; age 20. [I] was not in the habit of seeing the girl [and] do not\nknow what she was doing at the time. Two other persons were in the room,\nbut they did not share the experience.\"\nIn answer to questions, Miss W. adds :\u2014\n\"The incident occurred about a year ago last March or April. As far as\nI know, the girl was at that time in Nottingham, but as I do not know her\naddress, I am not able to find out anything about her. The figuie only\nremained about a second after I first saw it, and I do not remember in what\nway it disappeared. I saw it very clearly.\"\nIt is possible that the feeling of touch in this case was a muscular\nsensation misinterpreted. See Chap. V., p. 111.\nAn additional reason for regarding the hallucinatory nature of the\ninitial part of the impression, in the cases discussed alwve, as doubtful,\nis that in a large proportion of them (at least 35 out of 124) the\npercipient is awakened\u2014e.g., by the sound or the touch-\u2014and then sees\nthe apparition. This makes it doubtful, on the one hand, whether\nthe sound or touch was not a dream-impression, and, on the other\nhand, whether it was not real ; since there is a special difficulty in dis\ntinguishing between true and false impressions at the moment of\nwaking. Several other cases of the visual hallucinations that occur\non waking are preceded by more indefinite sensations, described in\nsuch terms as the following :\u2014\"woke with a disagreeable sensation\" ;\n\"woke with weight on chest\"; \"wakened by warm wind\"; \"woke\nwith feeling that scalding water had been thrown over her\"; \"woke\nwith uncanny feeling\"; \" wakened by some one \" or \"by something.\"\nHere again it is probable that some of these sensations were produced\nhy a physical stimulus of a normal kind.\nThe Operation of Suggestion in the working out of Hallucinations.\nThe operation of suggestion may further be traced in the develop\nment of a hallucination after it has once started\u2014one percept leading\non to the next by the working out of the idea involved. For instance,\n\f186 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nthis explanation appears to be applicable to the reflection of apparitions\nin mirrors,\u2014an effect which MM. Binet and Fer\u00e9 were able to reproduce\nexperimentally in visual hallucinations suggested to their hypnotic\nsubjects. In view of these experimental results, we cannot regard this\nphenomenon as affording evidence that the hallucination is more than\npurely subjective in such cases as the following :\u2014\n(690. 1) From Mrs. T. E.\n(The account was written in April 1890.)\n\" It was on an evening in June, 1847, when Mrs. E. was 20 years of age,\nthat she had this vision. The house she was living in was one reported to-\nbe ' haunted,' and Mrs. E. and her husband were only tenants in it for a\nyear. No tenant would remain in it for a longer time. Mrs. E. was in\nperfectly good health, and on the evening in question was sitting alone upon\nthe piazza of the house off which opened the drawing-room, into which [she]\nhad an uninterrupted view. The house was empty, the servants were away\nfrom the back premises, and the nurse had taken the only child out to play ;\nall the back doors were locked. Mrs. E. was watching a number of children\nplaying some distance off, and was certainly not thinking of anything relating\nto apparitions, or anything extraordinary, when, quite suddenly, and some\nwhat towards the left of the seat, a female figure appeared, and strode across\nthe drawing room in an oblique direction, but always keeping its face turned\naway from Mrs. E.. The outline was very clearly delineated, the dress\nMrs. E. remembers yet, it was so distinct ; and so vivid was the appearanee,\nthat, on casting her eyes on the mirror on the drawing-room wall a little\ntowards [her] right hand, she saw the side or profile of the figure reflected\nthere. So exceedingly real did this latter circumstance make it, that\nMrs. E., being certain there was a woman in her drawing-room, rose and\nrushed into the room, saying\u2014 ' I wonder how you got in, indeed ! ' only to\nfind nothing out of the common there. Mrs. E. said she had heard no\ndetails or descriptions of the alleged ' haunting,' and so her mind could not\nhave been pre-adjusted to see any one kind of apparition more than\nanother. She had never let the fact of the house being ' haunted ' rest\nwith or distress her, and on this evening was not thinking of anything\nexcept those children playing in the front of the house.\" 1\nThis is the only case in the Census in which the apparition is seen\nfirst and its reflection afterwards ; but there are three cases in which\nthe figure is first seen in a mirror, and afterwards appears to be\nstanding in the room, and the double impression in these cases seems\nequally explicable as the effect of suggestion,\u2014as whichever appearance\nis seen first, might naturally lead to the second corresponding percept.\nThe following is one of the three cases referred to.\n1 For another experience of the same percipient, see p. 174.\n\fX.] 187\nExpectancy and Suggestion.\n(208. 7.) From Mrs. T.\n[The account was written down from the lips of the percipient by the\ncollector, in August, 1889.]\n\" My grandmotherwas ill in her bed, from which she never afterwards got\nup.and we were reading the Bible\u2014she explaining it to me,as I was about [ten]\nat the time\u2014it was about an angel appearing that we were reading. I said to\nher, ' Oh, grandmother, I shan't stay here when you're gone ; I should be\nafraid.' My grandmother said, ' Nonsense, child ; I'm sure I shouldn't do\nthee any harm.' When my grandmother died [in February, 1865] I was so\nfrightened of being in the house that I went to a cousin's. After some time\nI returned home, and being one day dusting in a room (the room was next\nto that in which my grandmother died, and I was not thinking about her at\nthe time), as I was dusting the looking glass, I saw my grandmother reflected\nin it, standing at the door. I turned round and saw her standing in her\nnight-dress, with one foot in the room, and her head turned round to look\nat me. I made a run past her to go down stairs\u2014but I passed nothing, for\nshe disappeared I never knew where. My mother reproached me for coming\ndown in that way, saying she had never seen such a way of coming down\nstairs ; and I said, ' I have seen grandmother,' and my mother said she ' could\nnot think it.' I always thought my grandmother had come so, to show me\nshe would do me no harm.\"\nThe collector adds :\u2014\n\" Mrs. T., who is the wife of a blacksmith, says she never had any other\nexperience, and that this one is as clear to her now as the day she saw it.\"\nThe casting of a shadow by an apparition may similarly be ex\nplained by suggestion. This is only recorded in two cases in the Census,\nwhich we proceed to give. It will be observed that in the first case\nthe hallucination begins with the perception of the shadow.\n(361. 9.) From Miss A. S.\nDecember 30th, 1889.\n\" At my grandmother's house, Albemarle Co., Virginia, U.S.A., at about\nII p.m., my cousin, Miss S., somewhat older than I, and myself, had been\nconversing in the parlour. She left me. The house door opening into the\nparlour stood open, the night being warm, and the moonlight streamed in\nover the floor beside me as I sat, leaning on the sofa-arm, my back to\nthe entrance. The shadow of a human form fell on the moonlit floor. Half\nturning my head I saw a tall woman dressed in white, her back to me. By the\ncontour and the gleam of the plaits round her head I recognised my cousin,\nand deemed she had doffed her black dress to try a white one. I addressed\nan ordinary remark to her. She did not reply and I turned right round upon\nher. Then she went out of the door down the entrance steps, and as she dis\nappeared I wondered I had heard nothing of a step or the rustle of her dress.\nI sat and puzzled over this, though without taking fright, for a few minutes.\nI was unoccupied, ruminating quietly ; in robust health ; completely awake ;\nuntroubled ; [age] 16 years about. It was, I felt convinced, though I did not see\nher face, my cousin. I am short-sighted, but fully believed I saw my cousin.\n\f188 Report on the Census of Balluciriations. [chap.\nShe had shortly before left the room by the inner door. She lived there. I\nwas familiar with the sight of her. I was alone for about half-an-hour. I\nthen sought my cousin and found her in the other sitting-room with my\ngrandmother. I said, 'I thought you had changed your dress.' She said,\n' No, I have not.' I asked, ' Didn't you come to the house door just now ! '\nShe said, ' I've been with grandmother the last half-hour,\u2014since I left you.'\nI then grew frightened and went up to the only other two inmates, at that\nhour, of the house. These two (females) denied that they had been\ndownstairs during the interval. The negro slaves had all gone to their\n(outside) quarters for the night.\"\nIn the next case, on the other hand, the perception of the shadow\nfollows that of the figure.\n(240. 13.) From Mrs. W.\nJanuai~y 8th, 1890.\n\" I apparently saw my brother walk down stairs in his house in Newport,\nMon., between 2 and 3 o'clock, p.m., one summer day, 25 years ago. My\nbrother had left us with the object of changing dress to take us out for a\nwalk or drive that afternoon. The vision was so distinct that I allied my\nbrother by name, but it (the vision) bowed its head as if to avoid observation.\nI then looked over the bannisters and saw the shadow of the figure disapiiear\nfrom the stairs, retired to my room and mentioned the matter to my sister\nwho was with me, when we went to his room and called him, finding him\nstill there and in deshabille, and he had not been on the stairs or out of his\nroom.\n\" The house in which the matter mentioned occurred had the reputation\nof being haunted, though I was unaware of this at the time and was not\ntold until next day by some one who knew nothing of this particular\noccurrence. My brother has told me he once saw, as he thought, our\nmother pass through one of the bedrooms. Our. mother was at the time\nliving in [another town].\"\nWe may compare with this another case, No. 180. 15., where the\npercipient says, \" I watched the figure walk right round the room,\npassing between myself and the candle on the dressing-table, (for a\nmoment [it] hid the light from me), until it readied the hearth-nig,\nwhen it disappeared.\" The feature of appearing to hide the light of a\ncandle is also mentioned in No. 37. 13 (see p. 313).\nIt is, of course, the usual property of a fully externalised visual\nhallucination to appear to shut out the view of objects behind it ;\nthe effect merely becomes more conspicuous when the object in\nquestion is a light. For, in order that a hallucinatory figure\nmay take a definite place among the objects seen by the per\ncipient, and completely simulate the body that it represents\u2014as it\n-ordinarily does when fully externalised\u2014the vision of real things\nthrough the retina must obviously be inhibited to a corresponding\n\u2022extent. Sometimes, indeed, as we have before observed (Chap. VI.,\n\fExpectancy and Siujgestion. 189\np. 119), the inhibition partially fails: the visible phantasm does not\ncompletely obliterate the view of objects behind it. The apparition\nthen gives the impression of transparency ; and, lacking the quality\nof opacity, it fails to attain a completely realistic appearance.\nA similar inhibition of the vision of real objects occurs in the\n\"negative hallucinations\" imposed on hypnotic subjects, when a\nperson or object is made invisible to them by suggestion. But to\nbe able thus not to see a real objeet to which the attention is\ndirected, in the absence of any imaginary obstacle, requires a very high\ndegree of suggestibility ; accordingly, we find that, even in hypnosis,\nsome subjects appear to carry out the suggestion by creating for\nthemselves spontaneously a hallucinatory obstacle.1 Another striking\neffect of suggestion in the \" negative hallucinations \" of hypnosis\nis that the subject sometimes imagines that he can see real\nobjects in front of which a person who has been made invisible to\nhim by suggestion is standing. (See MM. Binet and Fere, Animal\nMagnetism, p. 309). Actual vision of these objects is, of course, pre\nvented, but the subject seems spontaneously to create a hallucination\nof them, in order to fill up the gap which the invisible object has\nproduced in his field of vision.2\nAs the vision of real objects is affected by that of hallucinatory\nobjects, so the vision of hallucinatory objects is, in the great majority\nof cases, affected by the various physical conditions which would\naffect real vision. Thus a real obstacle placed in front of the eyes\ngenerally prevents the sight of an apparition (see case of Prof.\nVignoli, p. 141) ; similarly, on closing the eyes, the apparition usually\nvanishes, and occasionally is seen again on reopening them, as in Prof.\nVignoli's case. See also an experience of Mrs. D.'s (Appendix D) and\nthe following.\n(364. 5.) From Miss T.

When the operator, who had been made invisible to\nhim by suggestion, was standing immediately in front of him, we gathered from his\nremarks that he saw a vague dark mass or shadow between him and the operator.\n1 This, however, does not always happen ; in our Brighton experiments, the\nsubject was sometimes conscious that he could not see what was actually hidden from\nhim by the invisible person, and was occasionally much puzzled to know what was\nhiding it.\n\f190 Report on the Census of Hallucinations.

I was working rather hard for an examination, and used to sit\nup till midnight or later. I was nearly 18 years old.\"\nWith these cases we maycompare further results found by MM. Binet\nand Fere in experimenting on the hallucinations of hypnotised persons,\nnamely, that the hallucinatory objects were sometimes hidden by real\nscreens placed in front of them and sometimes not. (Animal Magnetism,\np. 234.) In the cases where the hallucinatory objects continued to l)e\nseen in spite of the screen, some subjects appeared to see them in the\nsame place as at first, namely, behind the screen, while others would\nsee them transferred to the front of the screen. Similarly, in\nexperimenting with hallucinatory pictures on blank sheets of paper, it\nhas been observed that some subjects, if another blank sheet is placed\nover the one on which they first saw the picture, will see it\u2014either at\nonce or after an interval\u2014on the new sheet. Also, in some of M.\nBinet's experiments (quoted in Phantasms of the Living?}ol. I., p. 472,\nfoot-note) \" after a screen had been interposed between the patient's\neyes and the imaginary object, she continued to see, not only that\nobject (say, a mouse) but a real object (say, a hat) on which it had\nbeen placed.\"\nThe difference between hypnotic cases and the apparitions seen by\npersons in a normal waking state,\u2014 which, as we have said, are\nalmost always hidden by anything of the nature of a screen,\u2014seems to\nbe that the mind of the waking percipient is not exclusively concen\ntrated on the apparition, but is aware of his general surroundings, and\ntherefore open to suggestions from them. Whereas, in the hypnotic\nstate, an idea impressed by verbal suggestion takes hold of the\nmind with greater insistency and exclusiveness than in the normal\nstate ; the subject ignores everything else for the moment, and there\nfore other actions or objects do not suggest to him any modification\nof his original percept.1\nAnother illustration of the similarity of the vision of hallucinatory\nobjects to that of real objects is shown in the fact that an apparition\n1 The cases where a real object that has been made invisible by suggestion appears\nnot to obstruct the view of real objects behind it cannot be explained in exactly the\nsame way. Here a certain amount of unconscious reasoning seems to come into\nplay ; the subject, being convinced that there is no obstacle between him and the\nreal objects in question, infers from this that he must be able to see them, and\nunconsciously conjures up a hallucination of them in order to harmonise his con\nception of the situation.\n\fx.] Expectancy and Suggestion. 191\ndoes not generally follow the movements of the eyes,1 but can be looked\naway from, and back to, like a real object.\nSometimes the seeing of an apparition seems to depend on the\npresence of light, and this is probably due to suggestion also.\n(Apparitions seen in the dark, which are rare, are discussed in Chapter\nTV., see p. 78). Thus, in one case (No. 443. 15) the figure, seen by\nthe light of a lamp, disappeared when the lamp was turned out. In\nNo. 402. 19 (Baron von Driesen's case, see Chapter XVII.) the per\ncipient first heard foot-steps, and did not see the apparition till he had\nstruck a light. Again, in No. 422. 25 (see p. 192) the apparition\nvanished when the light was put out and was seen again on re\nlighting it.\nAnother instance of the operation of suggestion may be found in\nthe apparent effects on real objects produced by apparitions. The\nmost commonly reported cases are the apparent opening of doors in\nconnection with the entrance or exit of a ghost. We have already\nspoken of the possibility that the movement in such cases may have\nbeen real. Where there is any clear evidence that this was so, we\nhave to consider whether the door was not moved by ordinary means,\nsuch as draughts, and whether, in that case, the movement may\nnot have led by expectation to the seeing of the apparition, as sug\ngested above (see p. 184). But in most cases of this kind included\nin the Census, we have no evidence worth considering in support of\nthe hypothesis that any actual effect was produced on the door ;\nnor does this generally appear to be the view of the percipients :\nso that there is nothing to prevent us from regarding the apparent\nmovement as merely part of the whole hallucinatory conception,2 just\nas the movement of the apparition itself is.\nThe following are two cases of a somewhat peculiar character, in\nwhich apparitions seemed to produce material effects other than the\nopening of doors.\n(684 1.) From Mrs. P.\nFebriuiry 23rd, 1892.\n\" I saw my eldest child Daisy run down the two lowest steps of the stair\ncase into the drawing-room.

Au mois de D\u00e9cembre\nde la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e (la date m'est \u00e9chapp\u00e9e), je me trouvais dans le logement\nde ma m\u00e8re \u00e0 P\u00e9tersbourg.

Il \u00e9tait pr\u00e8s de minuit, et\nun silence complet r\u00e9gnait dans la maison. J'avais \u00e9teint la bougie, plac\u00e9e\nsur une petite table \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 du lit, au pied duquel se trouvait un tabouret.\n\"Las de me tourner sans pouvoir m'endormir, j'eus l'id\u00e9e de fumer, et\nj'\u00e9tendis le bras \u00e0 la faible lueur d'une allumette pour prendre les papiros.\nEn ce moment j'aper\u00e7us distinctement sur le tabouret ma d\u00e9funte grand'-\nmere, Marie Al\u00e9x\u00e9evna Volohoff(la m\u00e8re de ma m\u00e8re), morte depuis cinq ans,\nc'est-\u00e0-dire, en 1878.

In almost all cases, the\naffection of the first sense seems to lead on to that of the other, which\nfollows to complete a familiar conception.1\nWe have discussed above the possibility that non-vocal sounds,\nsuch as footsteps, which sometimes precede the seeing of an apparition,\nmay occasionally be real noises, which lead by expectation to the\nsight. But in some cases the apparition is first seen, and then foot\nsteps or some other sounds apparently caused by it are heard, as in\nthe case last quoted : the sound is then to be regarded as part of the\nhallucination; and this is still more obvious when the apparition is seen\nand then heard to speak definite words, as in the same case and in\nmany others,\u2014e.g. Nos. 620. 4 (see p. 195) and 422. 22 (Mr. Mamt-\nchiteh's experiences, Chap. XVII.), where the apparition speaks in\nanswer to a question from the percipient. This latter feature is\nalso recorded in a few other cases. Sometimes the hearing of a voice\nseems to lead on to the seeing of an apparition, as in No. 464. 15\n(Miss Dodson's case, in Chap. XVII.). Sometimes, again, an appari\ntion is first seen and then felt to touch the percipient, as in Nos. 61. 6\n(see p. 252), 215. 9 (see p. 224), and 73. 20 (see p. 132). Some\ntimes the development is of a more complicated kind, as in the\nfollowing case, where, as will be seen, three senses appear to have been\nmore or less involved, and the hallucinatory vision included an impres\nsion of life-like movement.\n(470. 1.) From Miss M. C.\nApril 1891.\n\" In 1866 I had a situation as governess in Herefordshire. [My age was\nthen] 39. One Sunday I was suffering greatly from headache, to which I was\nthen very subject. Mrs. M placed me on the sofa and said she would\ntake charge of the children, in the hope that perfect quiet would do me good.\nShortly after, she came to me and touched me on the shoulder, saying, as I\nthought, ' Take care of the children.' Knowing she was in delicate health,\nI immediately followed her out of the room, seeing her until I reached the\nhall, when I supposed .she passed through one of the doors leading out of\nthe hall. I then went to look for the children, and to my surprise found the\nmother reading to them ; she asked why I had disturbed myself ; my reply\nwas, 'You called me.' She laughed, and said : 'You have been dreaming.'\nThough I knew I had not slept, still I should have fancied I had done so, if\nI had not followed her across the room into the hall. Mrs. M. died in less\nthan a fortnight from that time.\"\n1 This operation is, we think, traceable in the veridical no less than in the\nmerely subjective cases: only in the former cases the suggestion of which we are\nspeaking, of course, merely supplies a part of the explanation of the phenomenon ;\nit merely determines the form in which the supernormal influence takes effect.\nO\n\f194 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nIn these \" bisensory \" or \" trisensory \" cases, the constructive\nimagination seems to have reached a higher point than in simple\nvisual or auditory hallucinations, further details being added which\nmake the percept more consistent with ordinary experience, and there\nfore more like reality. This may be regarded as an example of sugges\ntion and unconscious expectancy. The resemblance of hallucinatory\nobjects to the real objects that we are accustomed to see, e.g., human\nbeings, would generally lead to the expectation that they would, like\nreal objects, be perceptible to other senses besides that of sight. From\nTable II. it appears that in nearly 14 per cent. (225 out of 1622) of\nthe cases,1 more than one sense is affected. The expectation that this\nwill occur is not always excited, and, even when it is, the constructive\npower does not always succeed in creating a hallucination of more than\none sense. Thus, in certain cases, the appeal to other senses is definitely\nobserved to fail, e.g., when the percipient seeing an apparition puts out\nhis hand to touch it and can feel nothing, (see account of Dr. H. C,\np. 117); or when it is reported that no audible effect is produced\nwhen an apparition goes through the motions of speaking 2 (e.g. No.\n425. 12, p. 211)or of making sounds (e.g. No. 390. 1, p. 150) ; or again,\nwhen, as in the following case, it is observed that the apparition not\nonly walks with noiseless footsteps, but also fails to cast a shadow.\n(544. 10) From Miss C. B.\nOctober 7th, 1891.\n\" At the top of Heigham Road, Norwich, on New Year's Eve, about the\nyear 1879 or later, at 10 p.m., my elder sister and myself were walking\nhome from a quiet evening spent with an aunt and uncle. To our right a\nrow of houses were divided from a house enclosed in a high wall by a\npassage. Quietly out of the passage came an old woman about 5 feet in\nheight, wearing dark brown dress, and large black shawl fastened across the\nchest, the point of it reaching nearly to the bottom of the dress, and\na small poke bonnet. She walked before us some yards, exciting my\nwonder by her noiselessness upon the gravel path, and finally by the fact\nthat she cast no shadow. Putting my hand upon my sister's ami I said,\n'What a funny old woman,' but with the movement of my hand she\ndisappeared, we being by the blank wall in which there was neither gate\nnor opening, with plenty of gas lights, so that she must have been seen\ncrossing the road. I was in perfect health and peace of mind, and I think 17\nat the time. The old woman was entirely strange to me, I had not for years\nseen anyone like her : she simply reminded me in dress of the old-fashioned\ntype of respectable old age. My sister [who] was with me saw nothing.\"\n1 Excluding the cases where only an auditory hallucination of a non-vocal kind\nis added to the hallucination of another sense, the proportion is reduced to a little\nover 9 per cent.\u2014152 out of 1622.\n1 An interesting intermediate case is that in which an inaudible impression of\nwords is conveyed without any movement of the lips of the apparition (see, for\ninstance, case of Miss G., pp. 88-9).\n\fX.] 195\nExpectancy and Suggestion.\nThe frequent extension of a hallucinatory conception to other\nsenses besides the one primarily affected, seems to render it probable\nthat a person experiencing a hallucination has his susceptibility to\nhallucinatory influences momentarily heightened\u2014as it is heightened\nin the hypnotic state. This view is supported by a small class of\nbisensory cases, somewhat different from those just considered, in\nwhich the correspondence between the two elements of the double\nphenomenon is less close and complete. An example of this class is\nNo. 579. 24 (see p. 223) where the percipient sees an apparition of his\nfather and hears an unrecognised voice telling him of his father's\ndeath. Here there seems to be no necessary connection between the\ntwo hallucinations ; but it is as if the telepathic impulse were externa\nlised almost simultaneously in two different ways, in a manner that\nsuggests an exceptional degree of insistent force. We cannot, however,\nalways draw the line between these and the ordinary bisensory cases,\nwhere the affection of the two senses seems to give merely two different\naspects of what is obviously the same conception, as when an apparition\nseems itself to speak, in a voice which is recognised as belonging to the\nperson represented by it. Thus we have an intermediate case in No.\n728. 16 (see p. 309), where the tactile hallucination was obviously\nsuggested by the sight of the apparition that preceded it, though not\ndefinitely connected with this. Another intermediate case is No.\n205. 1 (see p. 199) which might be taken as an example of arrested\ndevelopment, so far as the visual part of the percept was concerned,\nwhile the auditory part was fully developed and recognised.\nSequent Hallucinations of the same Sense.\nAnalogous to the bisensory phenomena last considered are cases in\nwhich a hallucination is followed by another of the same sense, repre\nsenting a different object, but so that the connexion of thought is\nmanifest. Thus, in No. 460. 1 (see p. 288) the percipient first sees the\nfigure of her brother dying at the foot of her bed, and then sees a\ncofiin in the same place. This may be compared with the crystal-\nvisions which follow or respond to the course of conscious thought\nin the mind of the percipient, for instance, No. 406. 25 (p. 106).\nThe following is a peculiar case of this kind, which is also bisensory\n\u2014verbal suggestion from an apparition producing a second visual\nhallucination.\n(620. 4) From Mrs. W. E.\n[The account is written by the collector, the Rev. H.

' My dear, have you come home ? I\ndidn't see you come in,' I said, rising, but ere I reached her she had dis\nappeared. I did look about for her, but contented myself with the con\nviction that I had made a very strange mistake. Bedtime came a little\nlater, and, as is my habit, I opened tho front door to look round, and there,\nfacing me a few feet off in the road, stood my wife's mother, who had been\ndead ten years. I ivas shocked then. 'In the name of God, what do you\ncome for ?' I said. She moved to her left, and I followed till, opposite the\nwindow of my next door neighbour, where was a light, she vanished. I\nwas smoking comfortably, in no trouble of mind or body. My age 64. My\nwife had been for some little time\u2014a few weeks\u2014with an invalid at H ,\nand when told what I have stated of her visit to me, she said she was not\nsurprised, for she had thought of me very anxiously, because she was\nstaying longer than she had intended. When I went on to tell of her\nmother's appearance, she was greatly disturbed in mind, as I was myself.\nWe told it to no one but our children and near relatives. Our children are\nall grown up. My wife is now getting very much like her mother, but at\nthat time there was no mistaking the one for the other. I was alone in the\nhouse ; could not sleep that night, but kept my eyes closed lest I should\nsee more than I wished, and in the morning went to see my wife, about\nwhom I was very anxious, and finding her all right, I forbore to trouble her\nmind with what I had seen till she came home. I've never seen or heard\nanything I couldn't account for before or since, and I have been used to be\nout, often in the church and churchyard, at all hours of the night.

M.\nAugust 9th, 1891.\n\f198 Report on the Census of Hidlucinations. [chap.\nChapter XI.\nORGANIC EFFECTS ACCOMPANYING HALLUCINATIONS.\nIn the present chapter we propose to consider certain organic\neffects reported to us as accompanying hallucinations. It may\nperhaps be thought that this discussion would have been more fitly\nplaced in Chapter VII., in connexion with the \"Physiology of Hallu\ncinations \" : our reason for placing it here is that, in considering the\nexplanation of these phenomena, it is important to bear in mind the\noperation of suggestion, illustrated in the preceding chapter.\nThe first effect to be noticed is the \"feeling of cold\"\u2014generally\ndescribed as a \"chill\" or \"cold shudder\"\u2014which is sometimes\nreported as accompanying or immediately preceding hallucinations.\nThis is so common in magazine stories of apparitions that our readers\nmay expect to find it a normal feature in the narratives collected by\nus : it is, however, on the contrary, quite an exceptional feature, being\nonly reported in seven cases,1\u2014exclusive of about half-a-dozen cases in\nwhich a \"feeling of cold breezes\" is mentioned. Now it has been\nmaintained (see Journal S.P.R., Vol. IV., pp. 296-7) that one distinc\ntion between phantasms of the living and those of the dead is that the\nlatter are specially liable to produce this sensation, whereas it hardly\never occurs with the former. This conclusion is not supported by the\nevidence on the subject furnished by our Census.- Out of the seven\ncases reported, only one is a phantasm of the dead, namely, No. 422. 22\n(Mr. Mamtchitch's case in Chapter XVII). Another is No. 458. 9, (see\np. 332), and here the person apparently represented by the hallucina\ntion was living at the time. The following are three other cases.\n(182. 9.; From Miss K. M.\n(The account was written in 1889.)\n'' [About 20 years ago] I was about 10 years old, and was staying with\nfriends in Kensington. Between the hour of 8 and 9 p.m., we were all sitting\nin the drawing-room with the door open, [it] being a very warm evening.\nSuddenly I experienced a cold shudder, and on looking through the door,\nopposite which I was sitting, I saw a figure of a little old lady dressed in a\nlong brown cloak with a large brown hat, carrying a basket, glide down the\nstairs and disappear in the room next the drawing-room. The impression\nwas that of some one I had never seen. I was talking on ordinary subjects,\nneither ill, in grief, or anxiety. There were several other people in the\nroom, but no one noticed anything but myself. I have never had any\nexperience of the kind before or since.\"\n1 It is, of course, not improbable that the sensation may have been felt in other\ncases in which it has not been recorded.\n'-' See also Phantasms of the Living, Vol. II., p. 37, foot-note. Of the cases there\nreferred to, three were coincident with a death, and three others with an event\noccurring to the person represented.\n\fOrganic Effect*. 199\n(205. 1.) From Mrs. F. R.\nNovember 9th, 1889.\n\" When my father was lying on what proved to be his death-bed, I was\nobliged to go to the dentist. I was of course anxious about him and in pain.\nBat the physician had told us we need not fear the death of the patient.\nWhile waiting in the ante-room, I seemed to feel a shudder and to see a\nwhite cloud before me, and heard my father call me by name. I immediately\nleft and found my father insensible and he died a few hours after. This\noccurred May 5th, 1879, when I was 20.\"\n(277. 7.) From Miss I. B.\nJanuary, 1890.\n\" With my bodily eyes I have never yet seen the scene I see so often in\nmental vision, which, never varying, is always an expanse of bright green\nlawn of great extent, or large field, with a shady glade or path on the left\nhand side ending indefinitely. Suddenly the scene falls into .shadow, and a\nhorrible chill sensation comes across me. I shudder, and the whole thing is\ngone. Sometimes this feeling occurs several times in a day, and sometimes\nnot for months. I know for a fact it only lasts a moment, but is so vivid while\nit lasts that everything else is as nothing, though I see this through the book\nI am reading or the people I am talking to. It has occurred during every\ncondition of mind and body; and the first occasion is, I think, the first thing\nI distinctly remember. I was just four years old, and sitting alone in the\nnursery [in] broad daylight, when I saw this green brightness, and then when it\ndarkened I remember screaming out, and the nurse coming in and telling me\n1 had a new little brother just born, so by this I can fix the date. The curious\npart is that up to middle age the appearance has never varied one iota. \"\nIn another case (No. 579. 21) the percipient, who was then a girl at\nschool, saw an apparition of herself sitting by her side. This recurred\nseveral times, the apparition being always seen on one side of her, and\nimitating all her movements. It was always accompanied by a sensa\ntion of cold and then of extreme weakness. It recurred for two or\nthree months, during a period of serious ill-health, for which reason the\nhallucination has been excluded from our Tables.\nIn the last case (No. 736. 18) the percipient felt her dress pulled\nand a cold shiver run through her at the time of the death of a friend\nabout whose illness she was in anxiety.\nThus of these seven cases, two (Nos 205. 1 and 579. 21) are cer\ntainly phantasms of the living, and two more (Nos. 458. 9 and 736. 18)\nare possibly so. We may add the following somewhat grotesque case\nof what was perhaps an illusion, which reached us independently\nof the Census.\nFrom Mrs. S. W.\nJanuary 30th, 1892.\n\"About two years ago I was walking alone along a carriage drive, over\nlooking an old shrubbery, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon. The day was\n\f200 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nbright and clear, and below me among the shrubs 80 yards off I saw a tall\nthing like a long pole overtopping the shrubs, moving through them in a\nstately manner ; some articles seemed to hang from the top of the pole.\nAfter moving for a few yards in a straight line it vanished. I felt cold as ice.\nI did not rush away, but looked at it as long as it was to be seen, then I ran\nhome a quarter of a mile. As soon as I reached home I sent [the coach\nman] to the shrubbery garden, and he returned and assured me he could not\nsee anything ; he hunted everywhere and the two gates were quite safe.\"\nIt will be observed that in some of these cases the chill is reported\nas preceding, in others as accompanying or following the hallucination.\nIn the latter cases it would seem to be a natural result, on certain\nphysical temperaments, of the emotional excitement\u2014terror, awe, etc.,\n.\u2014caused by the unusual experience ; while in such recurrent cases as\nNo. 277. 7 (p. 199) the regular recurrence of the chill may perhaps be\ndue to association. One of our collectors (Mr. E. L. Kearney) has\ncommunicated to us a rather curious case of the association of this\nsensation with the sight of a real object of a kind which does not\nexcite any strong emotion in ordinary minds. The account is as\nfollows :\u2014\n\"The sight of a meteor gives me (usually) a chilling sensation from head\nto foot. On one occasion (about 1877) I was walking with a friend, now\ndead, and felt the sensation without seeing a meteor. I instantly demanded\nof my companion if he saw one, and he replied that he did. I have never\ncome across any one who shared this peculiarity with me. ''\nBut where the chill precedes the hallucination, it seems clear that\nthe sensation must be regarded as an incident of the whole nervous\ndisturbance of which the hallucination is one effect. In this connexion\nwe may refer to a case quoted by Professor James (Principles of\nPsychology, Vol. II., p. 323), of the apparition of a corpse, seen by\na blind man. The experience recurred repeatedly, and was always\npreceded in the percipient by a feeling of \" a cold draught of air\nsuddenly upon his face, with a prickling sensation at the roots of his\nhair.\" He afterwards traced the experiences to the strong tea which\nhe was in the habit of taking for lunch ; on giving it up, he never saw\nthe corpse or any other apparition again. Here again it seems possible\nthat a link of association may have been established between the\nfeelings of cold and prickling\u2014probably resulting in the first instance\nfrom over-stimulation of the nerves\u2014and the apparition : so that the\napparitions after the first may have been partly suggested by the\nrecurrence of the sensations.\nIt will have been observed that in the last case the sensation was\ndescribed as of \" a cold draught of air.\" As has been already said, we\nhave in our collection about half-a-dozen cases where it is said that the\n\fXl] 201\nOrganic Effects.\nfeeling of cold breezes accompanied the seeing of an apparition. This\nis mentioned, for instance, in the case that appeared, under the title of\na \"Record of a Haunted House,\" in the Proceedings S.P.R., Vol.\nVIII. (see pp. 320 and 325) ; on one occasion several members of the\nhousehold heard footsteps at night walking up and down the landing\npast them ; as the steps passed, they felt a cold wind, though the\nlighted candles they were holding were not blown about. This would\nseem to be merely another form of the feeling of chill just discussed.\nWe pass to a more unusual kind of case, where a sensation is felt\nresembling that produced by electric shocks ; this, too, may perhaps be\nregarded as merely a variety of the \" chill.\"\n(287. 15.) From Mrs. H. R.\n(The account was written in 1890.)\n[After describing an experience quoted on p. 170, Mrs. R. continues :\u2014]\n\"Once I distinctly had the impression of some one bending over me at\nnight, and the contact of this person produced thrills something similar to\nthose produced by a galvanic battery. I felt that it was the late Mrs.\nLaurence Oliphant, and yet I was fully aware that, as she had been dead\nthree years, it was impossible that I should receive any impression from her.\nI absolutely disbelieve in any reappearance of the dead, I think it most\nimprobable that there is any individual existence after death, and yet all my\nsenses were impressed with the personality of Mrs. Oliphant. Mr. Lau\nrence Oliphant had called upon me about a month before I had this\nexperience, and no doubt this recalled to my mind a photograph I had once\nseen of his late wife. I don't think I ever see or hear or feel anything of\nthe sort when I am in normal health. \"\nThe collector, Mr. C. Schiller, writes : \u2014\n\"Mrs. R. tells me that her impression of Mrs. Oliphant was not an\nimpression through any of the ordinary senses, but an impression of her\npresence, including, however, a consciousness of her form and features :\nquite indescribable in language. But she was made aware by it of details\nlike the colour of Mrs. Oliphant's hair, eyes, &c. She did not know Mrs.\nOliphant personally, but could form a general idea of her from her photo\ngraph. The experience occurred in May, '88, and was not suggested in any\nway by Mr. L. Oliphant.\"\nIn a few cases the organic accompaniment of a hallucination is some\nwhat more serious than those which we have been illustrating. Thus in\nNo. 422. 22 (Chapter XVII), Mr. Mamtchitch states that he turns\npale and his breathing is affected. Occasionally fainting is produced ;\nthis is recorded in six cases in the Census. One is No. 33. 25 (see Pro\nceedings, Vol. V., p. 462), where the apparition was unrecognised by\nthe percipient, but was supposed from subsequent enquiries to resemble\na man, unknown to her, who had died in the room where it was seen.\nThe other five cases were apparitions of dead persons known to the per\n\f202 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\ncipients. In three of these cases, it is very doubtful whether the\nhallucination was not an effect of the same physical condition that\nled to the fainting, rather than strictly the cause of the latter. Thus,\nin No. 152. 1, the percipient, camping out in Australia, had been\nnearly suffocated by the fumes of some charcoal which he was burn\ning to warm his tent ; on going outside to escape them, he saw the\nfigure of his mother standing inside the tent, and then lost conscious\nness for some time. In No. 681. 9, again, after mentioning that he\nhad fainted on seeing an apparition of his father, the percipient\nwrites :\u2014\" a severe nervous illness dates from that evening ': [in\nJanuary, 1884] \"which has lasted on and off till within the last year\"\n[1891] During the six weeks following his first experience, he saw\nthe same apparition twice more, and fainted each time. Another\ncase (No. 733. 18), quoted on p. 141, is an example of a hallucination\nprobably induced by a state of nervous agitation. In the two remain\ning cases, however, (one of which is No. 728. 16, see p. 309) there is\nno indication of the hallucination being associated with any morbid\ncondition of the percipient.\nPain.\nOnly in four cases is pain described as resulting from a hallucina\ntory touch. In three of these the touch was connected with an appari\ntion ; in the fourth case, the impression was merely tactile. In one of\nthe three cases, the apparition represented a dead person ; in the other\ntwo, which we quote, it was unrecognised. In the first of these latter\ncases, it is noteworthy that several other hallucinations experienced by\nthe same percipient were followed by more or less marked physical in\ndisposition. It may perhaps be conjectured that this exceptional\nresult indicates a tendency in this percipient to some peculiar recurrent\norganic disturbance, which in its first stage manifested itself in a\nhallucination, and which in one case was attended by painful sensations\nin the left hand, the commencement of which mingled with the hallu\ncination.\n(417. 17.) From Dr. Vladimir Solovioff.\nSt. Petersburg, February, 1891.\n\" Vers 5 heures du matin le 17-29 Aout, 1890, \u00e9tant arrive^ la veille de\nMoscou chez des amis a la cnmpagne, j'ai eu l'apparition suivante.

J'eprouvais une\nterreur panique et une stupeur complete sans pouvoir bouger ni proferer\nune parole. L'homme blanc approcha de mon lit, et alors je vis que dans\n\fXI.] 203\nOrganic Effects.\nu main gauche il tenait un rouleau couvert de caract\u00e8res inconnus, qui ne\nressemblaient ni au sanscrit, ni \u00e0 l'arabe, ni \u00e0 l'h\u00e9breu, mais plut\u00f4t au\nthib\u00e9tain. H se pencha sur moi, et alors je vis distinctement les trait* de sa\nfigure. Elle \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s p\u00e2le et d'un type mongol mitig\u00e9, avec une petite\nbarbe d'un roux clair. En tenant toujours son rouleau devant mes yeux,il prit\nde sa main droite, qui \u00e9tait libre, ma main gauche, et y enfon\u00e7ant ses ongles,\nce qui me causa une douleur aigu\u00eb, dit \u00e0 voix basse quelques paroles (en\nlangue russe) qui n'avaient pas le sens commun. Apr\u00e8s un certain temps\n(dont la dur\u00e9e exacte serait difficile \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer\u2014une minute \u00e0 peu\npr\u00e8s) il abandonna ma main et disparut au milieu de la chambre. Il,ne\nressemblait \u00e0 personne que je connais. Je ne me suis plus rendormi, et\npendant plusieurs jours apr\u00e8s cette apparition j'\u00e9prouvais des douleurs\nneuralgiques et des contractions dans ma main gauche. J'\u00e9tais seul dans\nma chambre. Des apparitions semblables, mais moins distinctes, me sont\nd\u00e9j\u00e0 arriv\u00e9es plusieurs fois durant l'\u00e9t\u00e9 de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, 1890, ainsi que\ndans les ann\u00e9es 1884, 1886, et 1889. Dans tous ces cas, les apparitions\nn'\u00e9taient pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9es d'aucune maladie ni d'aucun trouble moral particulier,\nmais elles amenaient \u00e0 leur suite des indispositions physiques plus au moins\nmarqu\u00e9es. Je suis absolument s\u00fbr que ces apparitions n'\u00e9taient pas de\nsimples r\u00eaves ; mais je ne puis pas dire que l'\u00e9tat de la conscience dans\nlequel je les ai \u00e9prouv\u00e9es f\u00fbt tout-\u00e0-fait normal\u2014c'\u00e9tait un \u00e9tat \u00e0 part, ne\nressemblant ni au sommeil ni \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat de veille.

When the candle was out\nand my wife sleeping,!! heard the blows repeated on the framework of the bed\nitself. I rose, lit the candle, and examined everything in the room, and\nthen visited the other rooms in the house. I could find no explana\ntion for the noise. As soon as I returned to bed and blew out the\ncandle, the raps were repeated. I looked towards the door of the corridor.\nThere stood a child [who] seemed about four years old, of darkish skin,\nhabited in the shirt which is usually worn by children of that age in Brazil.\nThe apparition lasted but a short time. It occurred to me that it might harm\nmy own child, and my first impulse was to throw some object at it to drive it\naway. On seizing a board that lay near, I felt a smart rap on the back of the\nhand, that pained me for three days after, though, indeed, there was no sign\nof contusion on the skin. My efforts to rise when I saw the vision were\nuseless. I could at first only turn my head. This happened in 1888.\"\n(725. 17.) From Mr. A. S.\nNovember 5th, 1891.\nThe rarity of pain as an accompaniment of hallucinations\u2014con\nsidering the ease with which sensations of pain are produced by\n\f204 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nself-suggestion in the hysterical condition, as well as by suggestion in\nthe hypnotic state\u2014tends, we think, to confirm our conclusion that\nhallucination is not ordinarily a symptom of a morbid condition.\nFurther Physical Effects.\nIn one case, the alarm caused by an apparition appears to have\nproduced an organic effect somewhat more permanent than a fainting\nfit. This case (No. 285. 14) was published in the \"Record of a\nHaunted House,\" already referred to on p. 201 (see Proceedings\nS.P.R., Vol. VIII., pp. 319, 328). The percipient, then a parlour\nmaid in the house, bad twice seen an apparition, which took the\nform of a dark shadowy figure, and she knew that others in the house\nhad had similar experiences. After this, she was sitting up in her\nbedroom late one night when she heard a loud noise, and, looking up,\nsaw the handle of her door twisted round, as though some one were\ntrying to come in, the door being locked. She was very much\nfrightened, and next morning on looking in the glass saw that one\nside of her face was slightly twisted. The effect lasted for some days.\nThe doctor who attended her for it thought that it might have been\ncaused by a draught as well as by a fright, but she was convinced\nthat she had not caught cold, and that it was merely the effect of her\nterror.\nFinally, we have two remarkable cases in which a hallucination is\nstated to have been accompanied by physical effects on the percipient's\norganism, resembling those that would have been produced by the\npressure of human fingers. The first of these cases is also noteworthy\nas being one of the very few in our collection in which a collective\nhallucination of touch is recorded.\n(106. 2.) From Miss M. P.\nFebruary 16th, 1890.\n' ' My sister and I slept in the same bedroom at the top of the house-\nin small beds placed about 3 feet apart. One night about 3 years ago, [our\nages at the time being respectively] 20 and 18, I awoke suddenly with the\nhorrible feeling that some one was in the room. For a few minutes I lay still,\ntoo much frightened to speak to E. At last I called to her, and she answered\nin a voice of extreme terror, ' Who is in the room ? I have been awake for\nages, and dare not speak.' At that moment a cold hand touched my face; iu\nan agony of fright 1 called to E. once again, but not saying what had\nhappened. The next second she shrieked to me ' Some one touched my\nface.' Overcome with terror, we pulled the bed-clothes over our heads and\nshouted for help. A few minutes later my brother came, and we told him that\nsome one was in the room. He searched everywhere, but of course found\nnothing. E. complained that her face was burning, and on lighting the gas\nwe saw that her face on the one side was crimson, with the distinct impress\nof a hand with outspread fingers.\n\fXI.] 205\nOrganic Effects.\n\"Twice afterwards, at intervals of about a month, we were awakened with\nthe same horrible feeling of a strange presence in the room, which for a few\nminutes paralysed all powers of speech, and once we saw the same thing\nstand between our beds.\n(Signed) \" M. P.\n\" E. P.\"\n(The second signature is that of the sister who shared the experience.)\nThe collector, Miss Porter, writes :\u2014\nFebruary 28th. 1891.\n\"Miss M. P. has just been here talking about her experience, but was not\nable to add much to what she originally wrote. On the first occasion she\nherself did not actually see the figure, but Miss E. P. thinks she did. The\nroom was so dark that it would have been impossible to have noticed any\ndifference in the figures, if they had varied on the different occasions; con\nsequently they decided that it was the same. The impression is that it\nalways took the same course,\u2014was between the two beds and passed from\none to the other.\n\"The experience has had such an effect upon them that, though nothing\nhas been seen or felt since they left the house, they occasionally wake in a\ngreat fright \u2014which soon passes off. Miss P. spoke of it as though the being\nawakened by the figure had got them into the habit of waking very much\nfrightened.\"\nMr. Podmore writes :\u2014\nFebruary 22nd, 1892.\n\"I met the Misses P. on the 16th, and they gave me an account of their\nexperiences, which occurred at their former house, about 1886 or 1887.\nThey have no means of fixing the date precisely. The disturbances\u2014four\nin number\u2014occurred within the space of 2 or 3 weeks. On the first occasion\nMiss P. saw nothing ; on the second occasion both sisters felt a presence\nin the room, having been awoke from sleep by fright, but saw nothing ;\non the third occasion Miss P. saw a very vague muffled form or shadow ;\nand, lastly, on another occasion, Miss E. P. again saw a vague form.\n\" The visual sensations appear to have been extremely vague on all three\noccasions\u2014certainly nothing approaching a distinct human figure. But the\nimpression of terror produced was very strong. The percipients appear to have\nbeen quite unnerved by the fright on the first occasion\u2014which may account\nfor the repetition of the experience. They could not account for the first ex\nperience, and had had nothing else of the kind. Their health was good at\nthe time.\n\"The marks, as of fingers, on Miss E. P.'s face were very distinct. She\nhad not been lying on that side\u2014so there could have been no normal\npressure there.\n\"Their recollection does not seem to be now very clear of the several\noccasions on which they had the experience. But it seems certain that they\nhad a collective experience of touching on the first occasion, at any rate, and\nsolitary visual hallucinations on two subsequent occasions. \" *\nThe other case of this kind (No. 134. 5) is given by a lady, Mrs.\nA.

[chap.\n(from the age of 6 to her present age, 56) of seeing visions\u2014more or\nless externalised\u2014hearing voices and feeling touches, all of which\nshe regards as due to the agency of spirits. \" Among many other\nexperiences of the kind,\" she writes, \" I have frequently been\ntouched by the finger of my eldest son [after his death], and\nthe indentation of it would be plainly seen on my hand when\nthe touch was felt, and sometimes it has been several times\nrepeated by request for others to see it.\" The account is endorsed\nby Mrs. S.'s husband, but we have been unable to obtain further\ndetails.\nSome cases have been recorded of similar effects on the organism\nproduced by self-suggestion in the normal state, e.g., a red mark on the\nankle from seeing a gate likely to fall against a child,1 while, by\nhypnotic suggestion, such effects may be carried much further. Thus\nDr. J. Rybalkin2 suggested to a hypnotic subject that after waking he\nwould warm himself at the stove (which had not been lighted) and\nburn a certain place on his arm against it, and that blisters would be\nproduced. The suggestion was duly carried out. Dr. Biggs, of Lima,1\ngives an account of three cases in which he had caused a red mark in\nthe shape of a cross to appear on the skin of his hypnotic subjects, the\nmark persisting in one case for many months. Dr. von KrafftvEbing4\nsuggested to a hypnotic subject, on whom the experiment of producing\nblisters by hypnotic suggestion had several times been performed\nsuccessfully, that a red mark in the shape of a letter K would develop\nwithout inflammation or pain, on a selected and protected area\nbetween the shoulder-blades. This occurred gradually, the process\nbeing completed in rather more than two months. Several similar\ncases are given in Mr. Myers' paper on \" The Subliminal Con-\nsciousness \" (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VII., pp. 334-347), from which\nthose just mentioned are taken.\nThese instances of the influence of ideas on the organism show that\nit is not necessary to suppose that the effects of the hallucinations on\nthe percipients, in the three cases given above, were due to other than\nmental causes.\n1 Dr. Hack Tuke, The Influence of the Mind upon the Body, Vol. EL, p. 35.\n!

We\nnow pass to examine the evidence for the operation of a cause not so\nrecognised, namely, Telepathy. To put it otherwise, we pass from the\nstudy of merely subjective hallucinations, in order to concentrate our\nattention on those which appear to have a veridical character.\nBy veridical hallucinations we mean those which, either from the\nideas involved in them, or from the time at which they occur, or both,\ncan only be accounted for on the hypothesis that impressions or impulses\nhave reached the percipient's mind otherwise than through the\nrecognised channels of sense.\nAs we have pointed out in Chapter I., a certain number of cases\nwhich would primd facie appear to have this character would occur\nby chance, and merely be \" extraordinary coincidences \" without\nsignificance ; accordingly, from the point of view of psychical research,\nthe most important object of a statistical enquiry like the present is\nto decide whether the number of primd facie veridical cases is more\nthan chance will account for or not. In the present and following chap\nters, we shall be chiefly engaged in examining this question, in the\nlight of the evidence furnished by our Census.\nThe hallucinations which have a primdfacie claim to be regarded\nas veridical may be divided into three classes. The first is the class\nin which the hallucination coincides in time with an external event\nin such a way as to suggest a causal connection between them,\u2014\nas when an apparition is seen by B at the time when A, at a dis\ntance, is trying telepathically to make him see one, or when the\napparition of a dying person is seen at the time of his death. The\nsecond is the class in which some information previously unknown\nto the percipient is conveyed to him through the hallucination. These\ntwo classes often overlap, as when a hallucination coinciding in time\nwith a death distinctly conveys the information that the death has\noccurred (see, for instance, No. 425. 12, p. 211; No. 381.4, p. 214; No.\n579.24, p. 223), or when an apparition represents some actual charac\nteristics of the dress or appearance of the dying person which was\nunknown to the percipient (as in No. 571.14, p. 237 ; No. 147.23, p.\n218). The third class consists of \" collective \" hallucinations ; that\nk, hallucinations occurring simultaneously to two or more persons,\nwhich cannot be traced to sensory suggestion from the same ex\n\f208 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nternal cause, and cannot be explained as transferred from one\npercipient to the other through suggestion by word or gesture.\nIn this and the next chapter we shall confine our attention to a\nselected portion of the first of these classes. This restriction is\nnecessary, since, in order to ascertain whether there are veridical\nhallucinations which chance will not account for, we have to select a\ncoincidence between two quite definite events, and see how often it\nwould occur by chance, and how often it actually does occur. The\ncoincidence most suited to our requirements occurs among veridical\nhallucinations of the first class, and is that of a recognised apparition\noccurring at the time of the death of the person represented by it\u2014a\nkind of coincidence which has the further advantage of being far\nthe most numerous in our collection.\nWe have further to define exactly what we mean by \" coinciding.\"\nWe propose to take the same limits of time as are adopted in Pltanlasms\nofthe Living and to call an apparition \" coincidental \" when it occurs on\nthe same day as the death\u2014that is, within twelve hours either before or\nafter it.1* The reason for selecting these particular limits is the con\nvenience of calculation. We shall accordingly speak of a coincidence\nof this kind as a \"death-coincidence.\" We propose in this chapter to\ndiscuss the death-coincidences reported to us, and in the next to consider\nwhether they can be accounted for by chance.\nThe number of alleged death-coincidences (in the sense just defined)\namong the first-hand cases included in our Tables is 80, of which 70\nwere realistic apparitions, 6 incompletely developed apparitions, and 4\nvisions.2 This does not include cases in which the death was known to\nthe percipient when he saw the apparition (of which there are 7\nwithin the prescribed time limit) \u2014nor does it include a case in\nwhich the percipient was in the next room to the dying niece whose\napparition she saw at the moment of death, since some sound may\npossibly have suggested that the death was taking place. Strictly\nspeaking, these eight cases no doubt come within the definition of\ndeath-coincidences adopted, but it is obviously better to limit\nourselves to cases in which the death was not known, because the\nknowledge\u2014or rather the emotions attending it\u2014might in some\ncases be the cause of the hallucination, and in any case would be\nlikely to influence its form.8\n1 The explanation of the inclusion of apparitions seen after death, as a part of\nthe evidence for telepathy, will be given in Chapter XVII.\n2 For an explanation of these terms, see pp. 60-1.\n3 We have also omitted 7 cases which may have been death-coincidences, but in\nwhich the percipients seem uncertain as to the closeness of the coincidence ; and it\nshould be mentioned that we have counted as one only, a death-coincidence\nin which two percipients included in the Census shared the experience. Such case*\nare, as explained at p. 51, foot-note, counted once for each percipient in the general\n\fXII.] 209\nDeath-Coineulences.\nFurther, to avoid complication, we do not intend to use for pur\nposes of calculation cases occurring to percipients who have experienced\nother hallucinations, some of which were, or may have been, appari\ntions of living persons, of which they have not reported to us the exact\nnumber ; nor experiences of children under ten. Of the first of these\nclasses there are 7, and of the second, 8 death coincidences. We do\nnot exclude these cases because we think them unlikely to be telepathi-\ncally caused. On the contrary, the experiences of percipients who\nhave had frequent hallucinations which they believe to be veridical,\nlike Mrs. McAlpine (No. 458. 9, see pp. 278-282, where one of the\nexcluded experiences will be found), require special consideration in\nestimating the whole evidence for telepathy. But in this chapter, we\nare considering a limited class of cases with a view to numerical\ncalculation.\nAfter making these reductions, we have 65 alleged death-coinci\ndences to deal with. Before, however, we examine these coincidences\nin detail, there is another question to consider :\u2014the question, namely,\nwhether a disproportionate number of alleged death-coincidences has\nbeen introduced into our collection by collectors seeking after particular\nkinds of answers. The precautions taken to guard against this source\nof error, and its possible effect on the whole collection, have already\nbeen discussed (see pp. 57-60). We saw there that either the effect is\ninsignificant, or the cases illegitimately introduced are balanced by those\nwhich from reserve or other causes are left out. But though Selection\n\u2014as we there called it\u2014has thus had little effect on the whole, it does\nnot follow that it has not disproportionately affected death- coincidences.\nAs before observed, it would affect hallucinations regarded as interest\ning more than others, and death-coincidences are so regarded. This\nis indicated by their being, as we shall presently show, better recol\nlected than the average of hallucinations ; and further evidence is\nafforded by the comparatively large proportion of such cases stated\nby our collectors to have been previously known to them,\u2014for, generally\nspeaking, cases thought interesting are those that will be talked of\nand therefore known. About 11\u00a3 per cent. of the recognised appari\ntions of living persons 1 (including visions and incompletely developed\nhallucinations) in our collection are stated by the collectors to have\nbeen previously known to them, and it is a striking fact that not much\nless than half of these known cases\u201422 out of 50\u2014are death-coinci-\nTables, but for the present purpose the case in question should, we think, be\ncounted once only, because, however genuinely collective the hallucination may have\nbeen, it could not be assumed that it was caused in more than one percipient by the\ndeath (see discussion on collective cases, Chapter XV).\n1 The percentage given on p. 68 is here slightly increased by including appari\ntions other than realistic.\nV\n\f210 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\ndences. In other words, about 25 1 per cent. of the death-coincidences\nare stated to have been previously known to the collectors, and only\nabout 8 per cent. of all the other recognised apparitions of living\npersons.\nThis disproportion renders it practically certain that errors due to\nany desire of collectors to obtain affirmative answers will have dispro\nportionately affected death-coincidences. We cannot estimate exactly\nthe amount of error thus introduced : for, on the one hand, our\nreturns as to answers known beforehand are incomplete, and on the\nother, answers known beforehand are by no means necessarily selected;\nthey would often have been collected whether previously known or\nnot. But we have obtained definite information with regard to a\nconsiderable number of cases, and, on the basis of this, we are able\nto form an approximate estimate of the influence of selection on\nthe remainder.\nOf the 65 first-hand death-coincidences with which we are now\ndealing, 19 were known beforehand to the collector, 26 were not known,\nand of the remaining 20, we have no adequate means of judging\nwhether they were known or not. Of the 19 which were known\nbeforehand, we have good ground in 5 (including 1 experience of\nthe collector himself) for confidence that the percipients would have\nbeen asked the question in any case. In 3, on the other hand, we\nhave evidence that they were specially selected. In the remaining\n11, we have no reason to suspect them of having been selected, but we\ncannot feel sure that they were not.2 The possible influence of\nselection is therefore limited to 34 cases out of the 65 : the exact\nallowance to be made for it we propose to estimate at a later stage.*\nMeanwhile the 3 cases known to be selected should, we think, be ex\ncluded at once. They are Nos. 61. 6, 301. 6, and 350. 1, and will be\nfound in Chapter XIV. pp. 252-4.\nDeducting these, we are left with 62 alleged death-coincidences,\nwhich must be considered in detail in order to judge how far their\ncharacter as death-coincidences is established, and what proportion of\nthem we ought to count. There are two questions to ask alwut each\ncase. (1) Have we good reason to believe that the apparition really\noccurred within 1 2 hours of the death 1 (2) Have we good reason to\nbelieve that it was recognised before the death was known, and not\n1 This number ia calculated on all the alleged death-coincidences, including expe\nriences under the age of 10, and those which were experienced by persona who have\nhad unenumerated hallucinations, and also eight second-hand cases ; in all S8 cases.\n- The information that we possess as to whether any case which we have printed\nwas known to the collector beforehand or not, is given at the end of the case.\n\u00bb See p. 243.\n\fXII.] 211\nDeath-Coincidences.\nmerely, having been unrecognised at the time, assumed afterwards to\nhave represented the decedent because of the coincidence 1\nExaggeration of the closeness of coincidence may occur in two ways :\n(n) from a tendency of the memory to simplify the phenomenon by\nplacing both the striking events on one day (cf. Phantasms of the\nLiving, Vol. I., pp. 140\u2014142) ; and (b) from a mistake having from\nthe first been made as to the date of one or other event. We have\nmet with an example of the error occurring in each of these ways in\nthe course of the present collection.1\nOf the second kind of error, by which an unrecognised figure\nis afterwards remembered as a recognised one, we have no proved\ninstances ; nor had Mr. Gurney when Phantasms of the Living was\nwritten (see that work, Vol. I., p. 137). Still it is an error respect\ning which we ought to be on our guard.\nThe best guarantee against both kinds of exaggeration is a written\nnote of the hallucination made before the death was known. Such a\nnote is stated to have been made in only six cases, which we now pro\nceed to quote. In only one of them has the note been preserved,\nand then only in an ambiguous form, but in three others (Nos. 425. 12,\n381.4, and 147.23), there is evidence, independently of the percipient's\nmemory, that the note was made at the time.\nThe cases are arranged in chronological order\u2014the most recent one\nfirst\u2014the dates being reckoned according to the interval between the\nexperience and the time when the percipient answered the Census ques\ntion. None of these six cases were known to the collector beforehand.\n(425. 12.) From Mr. S.

In the later version of the story, written in answer to the Census question\nand three orfour years after the experience, the apparition is said to have occurred\nwithin twelvehours of the death (which was that of a stranger lodging in the sanur\nhouse aa the percipient), and before the percipient had heard of it. We found, how\never, that we had in the archives of the Society an account at second-hand, but which\nwe had good reason to regard as correct, of the same incident, written about a month\nafter its occurrence. This account stated that the apparition was seen a week after\nthe death. The other example referred to is No. 656.21), quoted on p. 370. Here the\napparition occurred before the news of the death was received, but when the witness\nwas examined, it became clear that the news must have taken considerably longer to\ntravel than the interval between the hallucination and the receipt of the letter, and\nthat the belief in the simultaneity of the two events probably arose from ignerance\nof this fact.\nJ For another experience of the same percipient, see p. 382.\np 2\n\f212 Report on the Census of Hallucinations.

Walker-Anderson and had some con\nversation with him about the apparition seen by him in Australia.\n\" He told me that it occurred on the night of November 17th (not 21st, as\ngiven in the paper communicated), 1890. He had gone to bed early, 8.30 or\na little later ; and between 9 and 12 he woke up and saw the figure of his\naunt, Mrs. P\u2014\u2014, standing with her arms down near the foot of the bed\nat one side, dressed in an ordinary black dress such as he had seen her in\nmany times. She looked older and stouter than when he last saw her three\nyears before. She seemed to speak, i.e., he saw the lips move, though\nhe heard no sound ; and he seemed to catch that she meant ' good-bye.'\nThen the figure gradually vanished. They had a lamp in the room. He is\nconvinced that he was fully awake. He was not anxious about her, having\nhad no letters to say that she was seriously ill, though he knew she was not\nvery well. She used to write to him about once in two months, and he to\nher somewhat oftener.\n\" In the early morning he told his wife, ' I have seen Aunt P who said\n\" good-bye \" ; I am sure she is dead ; we will take a note.' So he put down\non a piece of paper, 'I believe Aunt P died on the 17th,' and put the\npaper in a drawer.1 He knows it was before 12 o'clock that he had the\nvision, because he used to get up at midnight to give the child something.\nThen in due time an English paper gave the news of his aunt's death with\ndate, November 17th. Afterwards a letter came from his mother with the\nsame information ; and when he came home he ascertained that his aunt\nhad died about 11 a.m. on that day.\n\" He remembers distinctly that it was on a Monday ; but he and his wife\nhad disagreed about the day of the month. It was, I understood, ascertained\nto be the 17th, by ascertaining that to be the Monday. [November 17th,\n1890, was a Monday.]\n\" This was the only time that he had had an apparition of this aunt. The\nfigure seemed quite solid and lifelike. It lasted, say, 20 seconds. He sat\nup in bed and thought for a moment or two that it had been his aunt in the\nflesh. He did not wake his wife at once, but told her in the early morning.\"\nMarch 20th, 1892.\n\"Yesterday I called on Mr. Anderson, and questioned him about the\ndiscrepancy of dates.

Mrs. Anderson, whom I saw and questioned,\nsaid that she had always remembered the day as the 17th. She clearly\nremembered his speaking to her of his vision at breakfast next morning, and\nsaying, 'I am perfectly sure Aunt P is dead,' and adding, ' I will make\na note of it.' She remembers that she made a note of it herself in a diary\nthat she kept, and that after the letter arrived in December announcing\nhis aunt's death, she referred to the diary and found it confirmed their\nrecollection as to the coincidence of the dates.\n\"H.

About the 14th of September, 1882, my sister and I felt\nworried and distressed by hearing the ' Death Watch ' ; it lasted a whole day\nand night. We got up earlier than usual the next morning, about six o'clock,\nto finish some birthday presents for our mother. As my sister and I were\nworking and talking together, I looked up, and saw our young acquaintance\nstanding in front of me and looking at us. I turned to my sister, she saw\nnothing ; I looked again to where he stood, he had vanished. We agreed\nnot to tell anyone\u2014and, although I wished to put it down in my diary\n(which I had not kept for some time), I was afraid to do so ; I therefore\nmade marks to remind myself.\n\" Some time afterwards we heard that our young acquaintance had either\ncommitted suicide or had been killed ; he was found dead in the woods\ntwenty-four hours after landing.\n\" On looking back to my diary, 1 found that my marks corresponded to\nthe date of his death.\"\n(This account was enclosed in a letter dated September 7th, 1893.

[chap.\nMr. Podmore called on Miss B. and her sister on April 8th, 1893, and\ngives the following account of his interview.\nApril KM, 1893.\n\" In September, 1882, Miss L. B. and Miss B. occupied the same room.\nThey had got up early to work at a present for their mother's birthday,\nOctober 4th (I saw the cushion actually worked on that occasion in crewels).\nMiss L. B. saw a momentary vision, near the washstand, of A. L., a young\nman who had left B a few weeks before for Texas. She made a note of\nit and found later that A. L. had been murdered in Texas the same day.\n\"A.L. (age about 19) was barely an acquaintance of Miss L.B.'s (she was\nonly about 14). But she, an artist student, had wanted to get him some\ntime to ' sit ' for her. They had probably not spoken to each other more\nthan once or twice.\n\" Miss L. B. mentioned the vision at the time to her sister. In Miss\nB.'s diary for that year appears an entry on September 15th. 1882:\n' Up at 6.30 a.m. working at present.' Miss L. B.'s diary for 1882 was\nfound ; the latter part of the year consists almost entirely of blank pages,\nwith a few cryptogram marks. Under September 14th, 15th, and 16th\nrespectively, appear the marks \/\\ , + , x . The succeeding days are blank\nin the diary for some time.\n\" Miss L. B. did not mention the incident to her parents for some\nyears. In conversation with me, Miss B. fully corroborated what Miss\nL. B. had said.\"\nNeither Miss L. B. nor her sister could remember the exact date of the\ndeath, but they informed us that it had been announced in the Standard.\nFrom the Standard of October 9th, 1882, we afterwards found that the\ndeath occurred on September 14th, 1882.\nIt will be seen that the marks in the diary do not clearly indicate\nwhether the apparition was seen on September 14th, 15th, or ICth.\nThe probability that September 14th was the day, is, however,\nstrongly supported\": first, by the recollection of both sisters that they ascer\ntained the coincidence when they first heard the news of the death, and\nwhen, no doubt, Miss L. B. would have remembered the exact meaning of\nall the marks in her diary, which she now forgets ; and, secondly, by the\nexpressions used in her account, which seem to imply that the entry relating\nto the apparition was thefirst one made after some interval.\nThis case was not known to the collector beforehand.\nMiss B. has had two other experiences which may have been\nhallucinatory, one auditory and one visual. It is worth noting that\nher father, mother, and sister have all had hallucinations. An\napparently veridical experience of her mother's is quoted in Chapter\nXVII., p. 371.\n(381. 4.) From Mrs. J. P. Smith.\nAmble, Northumberland, January 17th, 1891.\n\" In June, 1879, I was a teacher in Macclesfield. A friend, Mrs. , was\nnear her confinement. She told me she was afraid she would die.

She was shaking me, and saying, ' I have passed\naway, but the baby will live.' Then the figure left the room by the door. I\ngot out of bed and went to my sister and related the incident. We agreed to\nmake a note of it. Next day I received a letter from a friend in Macclesfield\nsaying that Mrs. was dead but the baby was alive.\n\" [I was] in the best of health and about 29 years of age.\n\" No other persons were present.\"\nMrs. Smith, who is the mistress of the Infants' School at Amble, informs\nus that this is the only experience of the kind she hiis ever had, and that\nto the best of her recollection the apparition was seen about an hour or two\nafter the death.\nUnfortunately, neither the note made at the time nor the letter announc\ning the death has been preserved, but we have received the following letter\nof corroboration from Mrs. Smith's sister :\u2014\n\"203, Elswick-street, Leichhardt, Sydney, Australia, November 2)m\/, 1891.\n\" I distinctly remember my sister coming into my room and waking me up\nto tell me of her dream, which was as follows :\u2014\n'\"That she had dreamt that a lady friend of hers some miles away had\nappeared to her and said she was dead ; but that her baby would live. The\ndream had evidently impressed my sister very much, as she seemed quite\nagitated, and we said we would note it down, and to our utter astonishment\nthe next morning my sister received a letter to say that her friend had passed\naway that same night. \"Annie Brown.\"\nIt will be observed that Mrs. Smith's experience is here referred to as a\ndream. That this is not her own view of it appears from the following\naccount given by Professor and Mrs. Sidgwick of an interview which they\nhad with her on September 16th, 1891. The account was written within\ntwo hours of their seeing Mrs. Smith, from notes made at the time.\n\"The figure appeared twice on the same night. The first time was in\nthe breaking dawn of a June morning, before there was any sun. It woke\nher, and she heard the words she mentions, but she did not get out\nof bed, and was probably only half awake. The second time the same\nthing happened, but she is quite sure she was awake. It appeared at the\nleft hand side of her bed, and, after speaking, it moved very quickly round\nthe bed and apparently through the door, which was at the right hand side\nof the bed parallel to the head and hidden by the curtains, so that she did\nnot see it go out. The figure went as if in a great hurry. It seemed to bo\ndressed in drab ; the face was seen\u2014it seemed exactly as in life. She felt\nno fear, nor sense of the supernatural\u2014only anxiety to question further\u2014\nand regarded it as real until, running after the figure downstairs, she became\nconvinced that it was a vision. She felt as she ran as though she would\nhave caught it up, had she not had to open the door. It was about 5 o'clock\nwhen she went to her sister, which she did at once after the second vision.\nMrs. had told her she thought she should not live, but Mrs. Smith had\nthought little of this, and it had quite passed out of her mind.

The figure said, ' Good-bye, Jim ; I won't see you\nany more,' or words to that effect. A month after that (the first mail I\ncould have heard by) a letter came, saying he had died that same night, and\nabout that hour\u2014September 14th, 1876.

From Mrs. Biildwin.\nNovember 19<\/i, 1890.\n\"I was my Uncle E. de C.'s favourite niece, and we had made a\ncompact that whichever of us died first should appear to the other. I was\nabout 25 at the time, and he said to me, ' You won't be afraid, but, if God\npermits such a thing, I will come to you.' This took place at Camareah, in\n1860. I was then a widow, living at my uncle's house. It was in December\n1863 (I had married again, and was living at Umritsur), when one morning\nat about 4 o'clock, as I was sitting up in bed with my baby in my arms, I saw\nmy uncle. He was lying on the sofa in the drawing-room and appeared to\nbe dying. I also saw his bearer and my Aunt's ayah. They passed each\nother in going across the room, and looked at me and sighed. I miid to my\nhusband, 'Look, there is my uncle dying,' and I described the above\nscene. He thought it so remarkable that he got out of bed and made a note\nof it. He wrote at once to my cousin C, to inquire after uncle and we\nheard from him that my uncle had died very suddenly, on the day and at\ntie time I saw him, of heart disease, after an illness of a few days, at his\nhouse at Mirzapore. \"G. Adeline Baldwin.\"\nMrs. Baldwin writes further :\u2014\n\"Camareah is between Allahabad and Benares, about 30 miles from the\nlatter.\n\" Mr. E. de C. was not failing in health prior to his sudden death, and did\nnot even know he had heart disease.\n\"I saw the drawing-room distinctly, with my uncle lying on the sofa.\nThe room was at his own house.\n\"The note that was made at the time, and the letter from my cousin,\nwhich my husband received in answer to inquiries, were unfortunately\ndestroyed by white ants. [Mrs. Baldwin informed us in conversation\nthat the white ants had also destroyed documents of greater importance\nto her.]\n\"I have quite lost sight of my cousin, and do not even know where he is\nlikely to be found.\"\n\" With regard to the mode of my uncle's death it happened just as I\nsaw it, inasmuch as he died in the drawing-room on the sofa ; the ayah and\nbearer were present ; all this my husband wrote and ascertained. The sofa\nwas placed in a different position to what it had been when I was last in thfr\nhouse.\"\nMrs. Sidgwick writes :\u2014\u25a0\nJanuary 3rd, 1891.\n\" I have just had a long interview with Mrs. and Miss Baldwin. Miss\nBaldwin tells me that she first heard the account from her father when she\nwas about 16 or 17. He died in 1880. (She was the baby who was in Mrs.\nBaldwin's arms at the time of the vision.) Her father was much impressed\nwith it. According to her recollection, the actual position of the sofa where\nthe uncle died was not ascertained, but Mrs. Baldwin is clear on this point.\nHe did die on the sofa, and facing the door, which was not the usual position\n\f218 Report on the Census of Hallucinations.

Mrs. Baldwin says that her uncle seemed to look at\nher and sigh, and so did the ayah and bearer. They would both have known\nof her uncle's attachment to her. She saw some details but not others,\ndoes not know how her uncle was dressed, but noticed a plate of fruit on a shelf\n(not, I think, verified). The house was well known to her. She was nor at\nall aware of her uncle's illness.\n\" She made some notes of the vision of her uncle some years ago, from\nwhich she wrote her account, but she is not sure when the notes were\nmade\u2014certainly since her husband's death in 1880.\n\"The duration of Mrs. Baldwin's vision of her uncle can only be guessed\nat. She had time to rouse her husband and to say, ' Look, there's uncle-\nhe's dying,' for him to say he saw nothing, and for her to describe what\nshe saw.\"\nIn this case also definite information is conveyed, but pictorially,\nand with more detail than in the cases before quoted. It is also\ninteresting as being one of the three apparitions at the time of death,\nin connexion with which, as we are told, a compact had been made to\nappear, if possible.\n(147. 23.)

A c\u00f4t\u00e9, par terre, dormait ma domestique\n\u2014une fille ci-devant serve, que j'avais emmen\u00e9e de Tver, et qui connaissait\nparfaitement mon beau-fr\u00e8re. Il y avait deux portes dans la chambre : l'une\nd'elles, conduisant au salon, se trouvait non loin du chevet de mon lit ;\nquant \u00e0 l'autre, qui conduisait dans la chambre contigue, je la voyais juste\ndevant moi, \u00e9tant couch\u00e9e ou assise dans mon lit. Entendant les pleurs de\nmon fils, alors \u00e2g\u00e9 d'un mois, je r\u00e9veillai la domestique et lui ordonnai de\nme donner l'enfant. Tout \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de mon lit, pr\u00e8s des coussins, \u00e9tait plac\u00e9 un\nfauteuil, sur le bras duquel je m'accoudai de la main droite, et, prenant\nl'enfant, je me mis \u00e0 le nourrir.

En ce moment 1a pendule de la chambre sonna\n11 heures.

L\u00e0-dessus, la domestique, tremblant de\nfrayeur, me r\u00e9pondit imm\u00e9diatement : \u2014'Je vois Nicolas Nilovitch ' (le nom\nde mon beau-fr\u00e8re). A ces paroles, mon beau-fr\u00e8re se leva lentement,\nenjambea de nouveau les pieds \u00e9tendus de Claudine et, se tournant, disparut\nderri\u00e8re la porte, qui conduisait au salon. Cette apparition ne m'effraya\nnullement, mais je r\u00e9veillai imm\u00e9diatement mon mari, en le priant de\nprendre une bougie et d'aller voir le salon. Mon mari se rendit \u00e0 ma pri\u00e8re,\net apr\u00e8s avoir visit\u00e9 la chambre attentivement, il retourna, disant qu'il n'y\navait trouv\u00e9 personne. Alors m\u00eame, je lui dis, que s\u00fbrement mon beau-\nfr\u00e8re venait de mourir \u00e0 Tver, et, comme nous nous aimions sinc\u00e8rement, il\nsera certainement venu pour prendre cong\u00e9. En effet, tout cela se confirma\npar une nouvelle, arriv\u00e9e de Tver, et annon\u00e7ant que mon beau-fr\u00e8re y mourut\njustement le 17 Janvier, 1861, \u00e0 11 heures du soir.\n\"De retour d'Odessa \u00e0 Tver, il m'arriva un jour de causer de cette appa\nrition avec le prieur de l'\u00e9glise de Notre Dame St. Vladimir, l'archipr\u00e9tre\nVladislavlew, qui, de mon consentement, publia ce r\u00e9cit dans la gazette du\ndioc\u00e8se de Tver.\n\"Aim\u00e9e Tichonowna Obalecheff (Veuve de conseiller de coll\u00e8ge).\"\nAttestation de la veuve de Mr. Nicolas Zikoff.\n\"Je certifie ci-dessous, que quoique la lettre de ma sieur, Aim\u00e9e Ticho-\nnuwna Obalecheff, par laquelle elle me communiquait l'apparition de mon\nmari, qu'elle avait vu dans l'\u00e9tat de veille, soit d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9gar\u00e9e, je sais pour s\u00fbr\nqu'elle avait exp\u00e9di\u00e9 cette lettre, avant que je lui eus envoy\u00e9 la mienne avec\nla nouvelle de la mort de mon mari, qui co\u00efncida avec le jour et l'heure\nm\u00eame de l'apparition.

The un\nimportance of this detail in itself does not, of course, affect its import\n\f220 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nance as evidence of the operation of some supernormal faculty. Another\npoint of interest in the case is that the hallucination appears to have\nbeen shared by a second person. The special questions raised by this\nsharedness or \" collectivity \" of hallucinations will be discussed in\nChapter XV.\nThis completes the death-coincidences about which it is stated\nthat a note was made at the time.\nThe importance and value of contemporary documentary evidence\nfor telepathy was first pointed out in Phantasms of the Living (Vol. I.\npp. 134-147), and has been constantly and emphatically reiterated\nby those who are working at psychical research, with the result that,\nin addition to what existed at the time Phantasms of th-e Living was\nwritten, the amount of it has since been steadily, though slowly\naccumulating.1 Some of the critics of the Society's work have assumed\nthat in a large proportion, probably about one in seven, of the cases\nwhere a sensory hallucination is experienced, the percipient would at\nonce write a letter on the subject to some friend, and that letters con\ntaining such accounts would, in general, be carefully preserved. They\nhave accordingly maintained that the absence of documentary evidence\nin the great majority of cases constitutes a positive argument\nagainst the telepathic explanation. The force of this argument\ndepends, of course, primarily on the frequency with which contem\nporary notes of possibly telepathic incidents are made. We have\ntherefore endeavoured to obtain information as to the cases in which\nany notes were taken at the time of the hallucinatory experience.\nFrom the information received, it appears that in 49 2 out of the\n1942 cases recorded, that is, in 2-5 per cent, some note was made, or\nsome letter mentioning the hallucination written, within 24 hours\nof the occurrence, and before knowing whether it was coincidental\nor not, either by the percipient himself, or by some person who was\ntold of it at the time. We have included in the 49 some cases in\nwhich it is not quite certain from the expressions used whether our\ninformant meant that he had made a written or a mental not* of\nhis experience, in order to obtain an outside estimate of the number\nof cases in which contemporary documentary evidence of any kind\never existed.\n1 A discussion of the state of the evidence on this subject two years ago, with a\nselection of cases received since the publication of Phantasms of the Living, is to be\nfound in an article by Mr. Podmore, \" In Defence of Phantasms,\" in the National\nReview for April, 1892.\n'J There is also an auditory case not coming within the scope of the Census ques\ntion, but printed below. No. 105. l(see p. 291), in which we have documentary evi\ndence and a few other non-veridical \"non-Census \" cases were, we are told, noted at\nthe time. These are not included in the following Table.\n\fxri.] Death-Coincidences. 221\nThe following is an analysis of the 49 cases :\u2014\n1 Number of Hallucinations\nabout which Notes were made.\n1\nKind of Hallucinations. Coinciding\nwith other\nevents.\nCoinciding\nwith\ndeaths.\nNon-coin\ncidental.

It is, of course, only the veridical cases in which\nthe documents are of value as evidence for telepathy, but the im\nportant point to ascertain, in considering how much documentary\nevidence could reasonably be expected to be forthcoming, is, in how\nmany cases such documents were written before it was known whether\nthere was reason to regard the hallucination as veridical or not.\nWhen we consider the very small proportion of adults who keep\ndiaries, and the probably still smaller proportion of people who are in\nthe habit of making any other written notes, otherwise than in\nletters, about any events in their lives, the small number of notes\nreported is not surprising. With regard to mention in letters, it\nhappens often that the percipient is living with the persons to whom,\nif he were living elsewhere, he would most naturally write on the\nsubject, and he therefore speaks of his experience and does not write\nof it. It has also to be borne in mind that the great majority of\neducated persons are reasonably afraid of being ridiculed as super\nstitious if they appear to attach importance to such experiences ; and\nare therefore much more inclined to communicate them orally to sym\npathetic auditors, than to narrate them in letters. It follows that\ncorroborative evidence depending on some person's recollections of\n\f222 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\na verbal communication, exists much more often than contemporary\nwritten evidence. We should further expect that, even if the percipient\ndid mention his experience in a letter, he would be inclined to put\noff doing so till he had ascertained that there was \" something in\nit.\" Also in a large proportion of the death-coincidences, the news\nof the death is said to have followed the experience after so short\nan interval that any letter telling of the hallucination before the\npercipient received the news would have had to be written very\npromptly.\nAs to the preservation of any notes that are made, it must be\nremembered that, as a rule, only a very small proportion of letters\nwritten on any subject are producible after the lapse of a few years.\nDiaries also are often destroyed after some time, and all kinds of\npapers are liable to be disposed of indiscriminately in the course of\nhousehold removals, and at the death of their owner.\nWhen the percipient makes a note for himself, he is generally\nsimply interested in proving to himself that the hallucination has been\ncoincidental. This is done once for all by his comparing it with the\ntime of death, when he hears what this is, and\u2014for him\u2014the note is\nafterwards almost or quite valueless. In eight cases out of the seven\nteen, in fact, the percipient tells us that the note was destroyed after the\ncoincidence had been verified. It would probably occur to very few\npeople\u2014unless they had been convinced of the scientific importance of\nthe matter\u2014to keep such a paper for the sake of proving to others\nafterwards that the event had happened to them just at that time.\nEither they would not expect that other people would be sufficiently\ninterested to enquire into the matter so minutely, or they would ex\npect these others to be their intimate friends or near relatives, who\nwere not in the habit of demanding from them written evidence of\ntheir statements.\nWe should, however, expect \u2014and this is what we find has actually\nhappened\u2014that in a few cases the percipient who had made a note,\nwould keep it for himself as a memento of an important or striking\nevent in his life ; and that a certain proportion of the letters\ndescribing the hallucinations would be considered by their recipients\nsufficiently interesting to be carefully preserved ; or that we might Ix*\nable to trace the answers received by the percipient to these letters,\nwhich answers, if dated and sufficiently detailed, have practically\nthe same evidential value as the original letters.\nWhether the proportion of documentary evidence that has been\npreserved in the coincidental cases is, or is not, smaller than would be\nreasonably expected, we must leave to the judgment of our readers.\nSince the numbers are so small, it will be convenient to summarise\nhere the amount of the evidence in the two classes of \" death-coinci\n\fXII.] 223\nDeath-Coincidences.\ndeuces \" and \" coincidences with other events \" put together, but it\nwill, of course. be obvious, on referring to each case, to which class it\nbelongs. Of the 17 coincidental cases which were noted at the time,\nthe note has been seen by us in two cases (No. 442. 17, see p. 213, and\nNo. 660. 6, seep. 282) ; in a third case (No. 290. 3, see p. 293) a letter\nwhich was written in answer to one from the percipient describing her\nexperience, and which establishes the coincidence, has been seen by\nus; in a fourth case (No. 34. 20, see p. 289) we have received a copy of\na similar letter ; and in five other cases (No. 147. 23, see p. 218 ;\nNo. 381. 4, see p. 214 ; No. 425. 12, see p. 211 ; No. 78. 16, see p. 299 ;\nNo. 458. 9, see p. 279) we have evidence\u2014either from the persons who\nreceived the letters, or from those who witnessed the making of the\nnotes \u2014confirmatory of the percipient's statement that the letters or\nnotes were written at the time.\nThe next best kind of confirmatory evidence is that afforded by\nthe testimony of a second person who has known of the percipient's\nimpression at the time, before the arrival of the news of death, and with\nhim has been aware of the coincidence as soon as it was ascertained. The\ncase then rests on the agreement between the memory of two persons\ninstead of on the memory of one, and granting that each memory by\nitself may be liable to err, it is unlikely that both would happen to\nhave corresponding illusions ;\u2014though it is not impossible that by\nverbal suggestion, some illusion of memory on the part of the second\nwitness might be induced, e g., to the effect that he had heard of the\nevent at the time, when he had not really heard of it till some time\nafterwards.1\nThe death-coincidences among the 62 with this kind of confirma\ntion are 10 in number, besides 4 of those we have already quoted.\nWe give 9 of them here, in chronological order as before.\n(579. 24.)

From the Rev. Matthew Frost.\nBowers Gifford, Essex, January 30th, 1891.\n\"The first Thursday in April, 1881, while sitting at tea with my back to\nthe window and talking with my wife in the usual way, I plainly heard a rap\nat the window, and looking round I said to my wife, ' Why, there's my\nl,Tandmother,' and went to the door, but could not see anyone ; and still\nfeeling sure it was my grandmother, and knowing, though 83 years of age,\nshe was very active and fond of a joke, I went round the house, but could\nnot?see anyone. My wife did not hear it. On the following Saturday I had\nnews my grandmother died in Yorkshire about half an hour before the time\nI heard the rapping. The last time I saw her alive I promised, if well, I\nwould attend her funeral ; that [was] some two years before. I was in good\nhealth [and] had no trouble, [age] 26 years. I did not know that my grand\nmother was ill.\"\nMrs. Frost writes :\u2014 January ZOth, 1891.\n\" I beg to certify that I perfectly remember all the circumstances my\nhusband has named, but I heard and saw nothing myself.\"\nThe house (seen by Mrs. Sidgwick) in which Mr. Frost was living when\nthe event occurred, stands some way back from the road in a garden, and the\ndoor into the garden opens out of the sitting-room, so that he must have got\nto the door much too quickly, if he went at once, for anyone to have got\naway unseen by him.\nProfessor Sidgwick, who called on Mr. Frost on June 18th, 1892, gives\nthe following account of his interview, written from full notes taken at the\ntime :\u2014\nJune 22nd, 1892.\n\" Mr. Frost had last seen his grandmother in December, 1878. When he\nsaid good-bye to her she said that she might never see him again on earth\nand asked him to come to her if she became ill, or if not, to her funeral.\nHe promised he would come, and said : ' They tell me that when people die\nthey can make it known to those they love. If you die and are happy will\nQ.\n\f226 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nyou let me know it ? ' She promised that she would if she could. She\nhad gone through trouble some years before and he had always been very\nfond of her.\n\"Mr. Frost was sitting at tea with his back to the window when he heard\na distinct knocking. He said, ' What's that ? ' turned round and saw his\ngrandmother. He saw her face quite clearly\u2014in the bonnet and cape that\nshe used to wear, and saw her hand in the attitude of having just tapped at\nthe window. This was at Bowers Gifford, between Southend and Pitsea,\n200 to 300 miles from Knottingley, where she lived. His idea was that she\nhad taken a journey to surprise him. She was an active old lady,\nand an excursion of the kind did not at the time seem surprising to him.\nHe thought she had come in this way for a joke, and went at once to the\ndoor and all round the house, but could find no one. He is quite certain\nthat no one could have got away without being seen. It was about 5 o'clock\nin April- -full daylight. He remembers the time of year by his having just\ncome back from his Easter holidays, and the time of the day by the fact that\nhe was at tea.\nIf it had been a real knock and a real person, Mrs. Frost must have\nheard and seen it. He was surprised at her not hearing and seeing, and she\nsays that she must have done so if a real person had been there, and that she\nwould have seen a person coming up the path. As it was, she could not\nunderstand what was the matter.\n\" Mr. Frost did not at first regard it as supernatural, but when he came\nback, having found nobody, the explanation that his grandmother was dead\noccurred to him. Mrs. Frost remembers his saying, ' I should not be\n\u2022urprised if my grandmother is dead.' He had heard of things of the kind,\nhut\u2014in spite of the talk with his grandmother\u2014did not really believe in\nthem. He has never had any experience of the kind before or since (only\ncoincidences of thinking about people just before they appeared, and to this\nhe attached no importance), and would have ridiculed the subject five minutes\nbefore. They had not been talking or thinking about her, and did not know\nshe was ill. He certainly would not have gone away for a holiday if he had\nhad any idea of being summoned to her bedside.\n\" They had news of her death by letter, naming the day and hour. Mrs.\nFrost remembers the letter coming, and that they noticed the coincidence of\ntime. Mr. Frost went to the funeral, but arrived on the Monday after, his\ngrandmother having been buried on Sunday. He saw the coffin, which was\nleft in the open grave till he came.\n\"I got the information mainly from Mr. Frost when Mrs. Frost was out\nof the room, and then obtained her confirmation by questions afterwards.\"\nMr. Frost could not remember the exact date of the death, but enquired\nof his brother, who stated that it was April 21st, 1880. We find, however,\nfrom the Register, that the true date was April 21st, 1881, and this was, in\naccordance with Mr. Frost's statement in conversation, the first Thursday\nafter Easter, 1881, though not, of course, the first Thursday in the month.\nThis case was not known to the collector beforehand.\nThe next case is a very peculiar one ; since a hallucination shared\nby seven persons and (apparently) by a dog also is something unique\n\fxil] Death-Coincidences. 227\nin oar collection.

From Mr. J.

I was about to exclaim at the strangeness of her\nvisit, when, to my horror, there were no signs of anyone in the room but\nmy mother. I related what I had seen to her, knowing she could not have\nseen, as she was sitting with her back towards the door, nor did she hear\nanything unusual, and was greatly amused at my scare, suggesting I had read\ntoo much or been dreaming.\n\"A day or so after this strange event, I had news to say my friend was\nno more.

Her mother told me she spoke of me not very\nlong before she died, and wondered I had not been to see her, thinking, of\ncourse, I had some knowledge of her illness, which was not the case. It\nmay be as well to mention she left a small box she prized rather, to be given\nto me in remembrance of her. She died the same evening and about the samo\ntime that I saw her vision, which was the end of October, 1874.\n\"Ellen M. Greany.\"\nIn answer to an enquiry, Miss Greany adds that this hallucination is the\nonly one she has ever experienced. She was then about 15 years old. She\ntells Miss Porter that she went to see her dead friend before the funeral,\nwhich accords with her statement that she heard the news of the death very\nsoon after it occurred ; and there is no reason to doubt that, at the time\nwhen she heard the news, she was able correctly to identify the day of her\nvision.\nHer mother corroborates as follows :\u2014\nActon, Jxdy, 1884.\n\" I can well remember the instance my daughter speaks of. I know she\nwas not anxious at the time, not knowing her friend was ill. I took no notice\nof it at the time, as I do not believe in ghosts, but thought it strange the\nnext day, when we heard she was dead, and died about the same time that\nmy daughter saw her.\n\" Margaret Grbahy.\"\nMr. Gurney writes :\u2014\n\" I have seen Ellen Greany, who is a superior and intelligent person.\nShe went over her story without prompting, giving an entirely clear and con\nsistent account, and standing cross-examination perfectly.\"\nThis case was known to the collector, Miss Porter, beforehand, but\nthe percipient was not included in the Census because of her experience, and\nthe case is one of those referred to on p. 210 as known beforehand, but not\nselected.\nIn the next case the interval in time between the apparition and\nthe news of the death is unusually long, and there is a discrepancy as\nto the day of the week remembered by the percipient ; but her recollec\ntion that the coincidence of the two events was ascertained when the\nnews came is clearly corroborated by her husband.\n(307. 20.) From Mrs. Murray.\nLangholm, Upper Norwood, Jiuie 13<h, 1890.\n\" Some time in the summer of 1869, awaking suddenly at night, I dis\ntinctly saw a man in naval uniform, whose features I recognised, standing in\nthe room, who seemed to walk behind a curtain. I had not seen the person\nfor some years, or thought or spoken of him,\n\" I was in good health ; 21 years old.\n\"I distinctly saw and recognised the face.

The figure seen was that of a young\nman, Mr. , who had known Mrs. Murray before her marriage.\nThe naval uniform with brass buttons, in which the apparition was dressed,\nshe had never seen. Mr. , however, as she knew, had left England a\nfew months before the vision, having obtained some appointment on a ship\n\u2014probably purser on a P. and O. steamer. She showed me a photograph of\nhim\u2014given to her later\u2014in naval uniform, but with gold band and large\nbrass buttons. She told her husband what she had seen, and he got up and\nsearched the room.\n\"Next day (probably a Saturday) she met the young man's mother at\nthe Crystal Palace, and asked if he were quite well. The news of his death\n\u2014by an accident at sea\u2014she saw some three weeks or a month later (she\nthinks), in an evening paper. The vision occurred in the summer of 1869,\nearly in the morning, for the room was partly light.\n\" No notes were taken of the vision, but she and Mr. Murray talked the\nmatter over when they heard of the death, and came to the conclusion that\nit occurred on the same day, the date of vision being fixed by the fact of her\ngoing to the Palace on the following day.\"\nMr. Murray's corroboration was given in answer to Mr. Podmore's\nrequest.\nApi-il 3rd, 1892.\n\" Mrs. Murray has advised me of your visit and the purport thereof.\n\" I recollect the circumstance very distinctly, but saw nothing myself.\n\"I however ascertained that 's death did occur at that time, as\nnearly as difference of [longitude] will allow.\n\"M. Murray.\"\nMr. Podmore wrote to Mr. 's brother asking for the date of his\ndeath, and was informed that he died on August 24th, 1869, on one of the\nRoyal Mail Company's steamers, and was buried at sea. August 24th, 1869,\nwas a Tuesday ; so that Mrs. Murray's present impression as to the day of\nher visit to the Crystal Palace is probably at fault.\nThe following is again a case of shared or collective hallucination :\u2014\n(418. 4.) From Mr. H. Sims.\n64, Geach-street, Birmingham, May 20th, 1891.\n\" Sixteen years ago, I had just got into bed, but had not lowered the gas,\nwhich was brightly burning. My wife and I both saw her aunt walk across\nthe room and disappear. The figure was as plain as in life. She lived\none and a-half miles away, and was ill at the time.

They seem both of them\nsensible persons. They are quite sure that they saw the figure independently.\nThey both saw it move in the same direction. The date was more remote\nthan Mr. Sims had at first supposed, viz., January, 1869.\"\nThis case was not known to the collector beforehand.\nIn the next case the experience is very remote ; but the recollection\nboth of the percipient and of his wife appears to be quite firm and clear.\n(523. 12.) From Mr. John Cass.\nCastleford, Yorkshire, December 18th, 1891.\n\"[In] May, 1846, in Castleford, Yorks, about 10 p.m., I saw the figure\nof my sister Isabella pass through the bedroom. [I had] just retired to\nrest\u2014light still burning in bedroom ; [I was] in good health ; age 29 years.\nMy sister and I were in great sympathy of spirit. I learned next day that\nshe had died at the same hour of above experience, at Barnsley, 17 miles off.\n\" My wife was present at above time, to whom I remarked, ' My sister\nIsabella is dead, I have just seen her pass through the room. ' My wife did\nnot share the experience. [I have had] no other experience so distinct as\n[the] above. \"John Cass.\"\nProfessor Sidgwick writes :\u2014\nMarch 18th, 1892.\n\" I called on Mr. John Cass this morning, and also saw his wife. She\nsaid that she remembered the incident as clearly as possible. She remem\nbered that her husband said, 'My sister Isabella is dead,' that she\nanswered, ' How do you know ? ' and that he replied, ' She has just passed\nthrough the room.' I asked about the coincidence of time. She said, they\ngenerally went to bed about 10, and as she was not yet in bed when the\napparition was seen by her husband, the time of it was thus approximately\nfixed. It happened on Sunday. They learnt that it coincided with the\ntime of the death by a letter that arrived on Tuesday from another sister.\nMrs. Cass said that she remembered her husband remarking, when the letter\nhad been read, ' that it would be about the same time. ' The letter was long\nsince burnt. The sister died of consumption, aged 24, near Barnsley, 17\nmiles off. They knew that she was very ill, but had no expectation of her\ndeath as imminent at the time when Mr. Cass saw the apparition. Mr.\nCass was not inclined to give details about the figure, beyond saying that it\npassed through the room, that he knew it was spiritual, but felt no alarm.\nMrs. Cass thought that she must have seen it if it had been a real human\nbeing. He was also reluctant to give details of his other experiences, but\n\f232 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nhe said unhesitatingly that this was the only time he saw the apparition of\na relative or friend. He thinks that he can make others think of him,\nand know elairvoyantly what they are doing. He mentioned, and Mrs. Cass\nconfirmed, that a daughter living 13 miles off had come to see him, with\nher husband, meaning to take him by surprise, and found dinner specially\nprepared for her and her husband.\"\nThe 10th case in which 'we have testimony from more than one per\nson who knew of the experience before the news of the death was\nreceived\u2014viz., No. 118.20\u2014will be found in Phantasms of the Lining,\nVol. II. p. 462, where it is numbered 500. We do not reprint it here,\nas there is some doubt whether the hallucination preceded the death by\nfour to six hours, or followed it by some 18 or 20 hours. In the latter\ncase, it would not of course have been a \"death-coincidence\" according\nto our definition. In this instance the death happened at a distance,\nand was not heard of till some weeks later, as in Mrs. Murray's expe\nrience above. Under these circumstances, there is naturally more\ndoubt about the coincidence when no note is made, since the evidence\ndepends on the percipient's remembering the date of the hallucination\naccurately when the news comes. If the death is heard of by telegram\nor otherwise on the day it occurs, a mistake at the time as to whether\nthere was a coincidence or not is almost impossible. The following 9\ncases are instances of this.\n(61. 22.) From Miss C. L. P.\n(The account was written in May or J une, 1889. )\n\"I saw my father. Date, Wednesday, April 6th, 1887.

R.\nAugust 22nd, 1891.\n\" When my sister died in 1877, she died in Dublin. I was at home ; we\nknew she was very ill, and my father, who was in Dublin, said he would\ntelegraph if she grew worse. But that night I saw my sister lying dead\nbeside me, and I knew, before we sent for the telegram, the contents of it.\nIt came by post next morning.\"\nIn answer to our enquiries, Miss R. sent the following more detailed\naccount of her experience:\u2014\nSeptember 5th, 1891.\n\" At the time of my sister's death, I was sleeping in my mother's room,\nand my thoughts were very much with my sister, who was dangerously ill in\nDublin, and just as I lay down, I plainly saw her lying dead beside me,\nwith her arm outside the clothes, just as she had died a few hours ago.\nI scarcely slept at all that night, and there my sister lay beside me, and I\nwas glad to have her, knowing too well what the contents of the telegram\nwould be next morning. 1 said nothing of it to anyone, till I was sending\nthe groom to the post office for it, and then I said to him, ' I know the\ncontents of it, Mrs. R. is dead.' I do not think it would be any use asking\nhim any questions\u2014he left my father's service shortly after, and I am sure\ncould not recall events so long past.\"\nSome years after this incident, Miss R. saw repeatedly apparitions of her\nmother, which she describes as follows:\u2014\nAugust 22nd, 1891.\n\"My mother died in February, 1882, and for three months after her\ndeath she used to come to me almost nightly, after I had retired to my\nbed-room. Sometimes she would come up to the bed and bend over me;\nat other times she would stand at the door and beckon to me.\"\nProfessor Sidgwick writes:\u2014\nMarch 23rd, 1892.\n\" I saw Miss R. to-day, and she described to me her experiences. The\napparition of her sister was the first hallucination she ever had. It oc\ncurred about six hours after her death; she died at four o'clock in the after\nnoon, and Miss R. went to bed about 10, and had the vision soon after. She\nknew her sister was very ill, but did not think there was immediate danger;\n\fm] 235\nDeath-Coincidences.\nher father had gone to Dublin to the sister, and had promised to write\nor telegraph if there was such danger ; but in fact the alarming symptoms\nonly manifested themselves half-an-hour before she died.\n\" What she saw was first ' something white ' on a long cedar chest beside\nher bed; then looking closer it seemed to be her sister in bed; the chest was\nplain bare wood, but it seemed just like a bed. She saw the face distinctly;\nshe had put out the candle, but there was a fire in her room; she is quite\nsure that she was awake. She saw it all night whenever she turned to it,\njust as if it was a real form. She was clearly anxious to give her recollection\nexactly.\n\" The apparitions of her mother were always completely externalised ; she\nappeared just as in life. The first time she appeared standing in the\ndoorway, with a gesture as if beckoning to follow, and this was the more\nusual appearance ; but sometimes she came when Miss R. was in bed, and\nseemed to stoop over the bed.\"\nThe next case is one to which we have referred in Chapter VI.,\np. 117, as an instance of gradual development of the apparition.\n(328. 5.)

From Dr. B. G.\nRio de Janeiro, Septembei- lit. 1891.\n\" I saw very distinctly the apparition of a friend passing in front of\na looking glass. I was then in bed. I lived at the time in Rio de Janeiro.\nIt was, I believe, about 3 a.m. I told my wife at the time to look at the\nwatch. This occurred November 21st, 1873.\n\" I was lying awake in bed. My health was good at the time. We had\ntaken it in turns to sit up with the sick man whose phantasm appeared, but\nI had rested from my watching. I was 57 years old.\n\" The appearance coincided, as nearly as we could make out, with the\nmoment of death. It wag that of a friend, Sn. A., whom I had visited\nthe night before. I had sat up with him on previous nights, and therefore\nknew that he was seriously ill.\n\" My wife was present, hut sleeping. I woke her, told her what I had\nseen and asked her to look at the watch. My son, who had been watching\nby the decedent, and who had witnessed the death, returned at 6 a.m. I\ntold him, much to his surprise, that I knew Sn. A. had expired at 3 a.m. He\nconfirmed it.\"\nThis case was known to the collector beforehand.\nThe next is again a case in which there was a veridical element\nbesides the coincidence,\u2014viz., the dress of the apparition, which,\nunknown to the percipient, resembled that of the decedent.\n(571. 14.) From Mrs. Belcher.\nApsley House, Gloucester, September 26th, 1891.\n\"When 1 was about 19 years old, an old friend of my mother's, Mr.\nWilson,1 came to live near us. He had just lost his wife and was himself in\nconsumption, with no chance of permanent recovery. He was in the habit\nof coming to our house in a bath-chair every morning, when he was well\nenough, and having a rest and a little luncheon. One day he came as usual,\nbut looking much better and in particularly good spirits. On the evening of\nthat day, about 9 o'clock (it was quite dusk), I was sitting at supper with my\nmother and aunt in the dining-room, with my back to the window, and facing\nan old-fashioned sideboard. I distinctly saw Mr. Wilson standing, resting\nhis elbow on the sideboard and his face on his hand ; he had no coat on, and\nI was particularly struck by noticing that the back of his waistcoat was made\nof a very shiny material. I felt as though I could not take my eyes off him,\nand my aunt, noticing that I looked terrified, asked me what was the matter\nHe then disappeared. Within an hour a messenger came to fetch my mother,\ntelling her that Mr. W. had broken a blood vessel and was dying. We went\nround just in time to see him alive, and he was lying on the bed, on his\nside, withoxU a coat. and wearing a waistcoat with & particularly shiny back.\n\"This vision so unnerved me that for months I was unable to go about\nthe house alone, even in the daytime. This is perfectly correct, not in any\nway exaggerated. \" Ada Belcher.\"\n1 This is an assumed name. The real name of the gentleman was given us in\nconfidence.\n\f238 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nMr. Myers writes :\u2014\nDecember 22\u00bbkf, 1891.\n\"I have to-day seen Mrs. Belcher, an excellent witness. Her mother\nhad been very kind to the invalid, and he left souvenirs to mother and\ndaughter\u2014some cabinets, which I saw, to the daughter. The date mu\u00abt\nhave been 20 or 26 years ago.\n\" The figure looked quite solid ; it gazed into the room, but not at Mrs.\nBelcher. The back of the waistcoat was clearly seen, a black shining\nmaterial. Mrs. Belcher had never seen the decedent without his coat.\n\" She has had one other slight experience\u2014perhaps a mere illusion. Her\nnerves were much shaken by the apparition of Mr. Wilson, and one day, soon\nafterwards, while looking in the glass, she thought she saw in the glass her\nmother looking over her shoulder\u2014in the dress which she was wearing at\nthe time. Mrs. Belcher does not regard this as a full-blown hallucination.\"\nIn the next case the percipient knew of the illness of the brother\nwhose figure appeared to him ; but we see no reason to doubt his\nassertion that the knowledge was not attended by serious anxiety.\n(452. 10.) From Mr. Alexander Sherar.\n5, Wellwood-street, Amble, Northumberland, September 15th, 1891.\n\" About 27 years ago, when about 11 years of age, one morning at about\n11 o'clock, going downstairs on my way to work I met a figure which I instantly\nrecognised as that of my brother, who had fallen into the water a few days\npreviously, and was lying ill at his house about 200 yards off. I was\naccustomed to see [him] daily. He seemed to have just come out of the\nwater, as the water was running from him. I was startled and ran into the\nhouse and told my mother, who, knowing my brother was confined to bed,\nran to his house, and found that he had died about the time I saw him.\n\" I was in good health, and in no grief or anxiety. No one [was] with me\nat the time. My present age is 38.\n\"Alexander Sherar.\"\nMr. Sherar has had one other veridical hallucination, which we have\nclassed as a \" vision.\" It is included in the 62 death-coincidences, and is\ninteresting as being of the nature of a crystal-vision, and also in connexion\nwith his former experience. It is therefore printed here, to keep the two\ntogether, but the coincidence is not so certain as in the first case, since the\nnews of death may not have been received till some time later. He describes\nit thus :\u2014\n\"When about 20 years of age, on board ship in the North Sea (about\nJuly, 1873 ?), about 6 to 8 p.m., while I was at the wheel I was startled by\nseeing reflected in the face of the compass the face of a young lady to whom\nI was to be married on my return home. On arrival at Berwick next day I\nlearnt that the lady had died about the time I saw her. I was not at [the]\ntime of seeing [the] face aware she was ill.\"\nThe following account of an interview with Mr. Sherar, on September\n16th, 1891, is given by Professor and Mrs. Sidgwick, from notes taken at\nthe time :\u2014\n\fDeath-Coincidences. 289\n\"Mr. Sherar is a sailor. He struck us as having a very vivid recollection\nof his experiences. He was starting to go down the stairs when he saw the\nfigure of his brother coming up. They met on the landing, where the stairs\nturned. The figure stopped, and Mr. Sherar, knowing it could not really\nbe his brother, turned at once and ran back to tell his mother. He did not\nlook round again, and did not see the figure after he turned. He did not\naee bis brother drawn out of the water : indeed, he had not seen him at\nsi] since he fell in and became ill. He did not think him so seriously ill\nthat there was any need to go. His mother and all his family are dead, so\nthat no corroboration can be obtained.\n\" At the time of his second experience he lived at Shields, and so did the\nyoung lady. He heard of her death by letter from a friend, who wrote to\nhim at once. The letter came after he landed at Berwick. He believes the\nwriter of the letter to be dead, and the crew, to whom he probably\nmentioned the vision, are scattered. No corroboration can be obtained.\nWhen the letter came he believes he made out the coincidence of time. He\nwas not anxious and was not specially thinking of her when he saw the face.\nThe illness was short and he knew nothing of it. After seeing the face he\nforeboded evil. It was getting dusk when he saw it. He has had no other\nexperiences of the kind except these two.\"\nThese cases were not known to the collector beforehand.\nThe next case is very like Dr. B.

From the Rev. C C. McKechnie.\n43, Stanhope-road, Darlington, September 24th, 1889.\n\" I was about 10 years of age at the time, and had for several years been\nliving with my grandfather, who was an elder in the Kirk of Scotland, and\nin good circumstances. He was very much attached to me, and often\nexpressed his intention of having me educated for the ministry in the Kirk.\nSuddenly, however, he was seized with an illness, which in a couple of days\nproved mortal. At the time of his death, and without my having any appre\nhension of it, I happened to be at my father's house, about a mile off. I\nwas leaning in a listless sort of way against the kitchen table, looking\nupwards at the ceiling, and thinking of nothing in particular, when my\ngrandfather's face appeared to grow out of the ceiling, at first dim and\nindistinct, but becoming more and more complete until it seemed in every\nrespect as full and perfect as I had ever seen it. It looked down upon me,\nas I thought, with a wonderful expression of tenderness and affection.\nThen it disappeared, not suddenly, but gradually ; its features fading and\nbecoming dim and indistinct, until I saw nothing but the bare ceiling.\nI spoke at the time of what I saw to my mother, but she made no account\nof it, thinking probably it was nothing more than a boyish vagary. In\nabout 15 or 20 minutes after seeing the vision, a boy came running breath\nless to my father's with the news that my grandfather had just died.\n\" I have never been able to persuade myself that the vision was purely\nsubjective. I have rather been inclined to think that the explanation is\nto be sought in my grandfather's exceptionally strong love for me, impelling\nand enabling him to bring himself into connection with me, at the moment\nof his death, in the way I have stated. It was at Paisley where the above\noccurred.\n' ' To the best of my recollection this is a correct statement.\n\" Colin Campbell McKechnie.\"\nOn being asked for an approximate date, Mr. McKechnie writes:\u2014\n\"To the best of my recollection the boyish vision\u2014if I may so call it-\noccurred in 1830 or 1831. The Register of Deaths kept in the Gaelic\nChapel of Paisley, if consulted, would enable one to fix the date. Grand\nfather lived in Sneddon-street, and his name was John McKechnie.\n\" Colin C. McKechnie.\"\nProfessor Sidgwick called on Mr. McKechnie on September 23rd, 1891,\nand writes on the same day :\u2014\n\fXII.] 2+1\nDeath-Coincidences.\n\" Mr. McKechnie has had no other experience of the kind, except that\nof hearing a voice, which was ' between sleeping and waking. ' In the case\nof his vision of his grandfather's face he was certainly awake.\n\" He believes that he was in no anxiety about his grandfather's illness,\nthough he was aware of it.\n\" He has often told the story, but no corroboration is now possible, all\nthose who could have corroborated being no longer living.\n\"I saw an account written by Mr. Kendall (the collector), on November\n2nd, 1870, from memory, a day or two after hearing it from Mr. McKechnie.\nThis is briefer, but corresponds in all essential respects with the narrative\ngiven above, except that the news of the death is said to have come ten\nminutes after.\"\nWe add one more case in which the action taken in consequence\nof the apparition shows it to have been at the time of an impressive\ncharacter, and makes it improbable that any mistake could have been\nmade as to the coincidence when the death was heard of. No\ncorroboration is now obtainable.\n(579. 25.)

For another (No. 118.\n20) we have referred him to Phantasms of the Living ; and three\nmore, viz., Nos. 407. 3, 460. 1, and 692. 2, are printed in other chapters\nto illustrate different points (see pp. 129, 288 and 115). We have not\nB\n\f242 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nthought it worth while to print more specimens of this class, though\nwe keep the rest for reference.\nThe 26 given in this chapter seem to us, on the whole, the best\nevidentially. It is, of course, difficult to draw the line, and probably\nsome of those omitted might be thought by others more impressive\nthan some which we have included ; but the evidential value of many\nof the unprinted cases is not very great. When, however, it is\nremembered that the 62 cases are simply all the cases which, in the\nanswers to our circular of enquiry, have been reported to us as death-\ncoincidences among the recognised visual phantasms, leaving out those\nonly which belong to the classes specified on pp. 209-10, it will be\nobvious that their value as evidence must vary considerably. Some of\nthe cases are very remote ; others are vaguely and inadequately des\ncribed ; many are without corroboration or confirmation of any kind, the\npersons who could have given corroboration in many cases being dead,\nor having been lost sight of. That in some among so many the close\nness of coincidence is exaggerated, we might safely assume a priori.\nBut we have now to show that indirect evidence of such exaggeration\nis afforded by the distribution of the cases in time, since there is\ngood reason for believing the remoter cases to be too numerous in\nproportion to the recent ones.\nIf the 62 death-coincidences are divided into those that occurred\nwithin 10 years of the answering of the Census question and those that\noccurred earlier, it will be found that the number in the recent period\nis 11, and in the remoter period 51. Now the average age of the per\ncipients at the time of answering the question was 46 years,1 and as we\nhave not included experiences occurring at ages under 10, this gives an\naverage period of 36 years over which the 62 death-coincidences are\ndistributed. If we assume that death-coincidences are equally likely\nto occur at all ages from 10 years old upwards, and\u2014unlike the\naverage hallucination\u2014equally likely to be remembered, however\nremote, then 62 divided by 3-6, or about 17, is the number which\nshould have occurred, out of the 62, in the most recent ten years (a period\nwhich, as our percipients are all over 20 years of age, is common to\nthem all), leaving 45 for the remote period. This is a very different\nproportion from the actual one. We cannot, of course, expect the\nproportion to conform so exactly to the average as we should were\nwe dealing with a larger number of percipients, but 51 remote experi\nences should on an average imply 19 or 20 recent ones instead of 11,\nand that the recent experiences should by chance alone be not much\nover half the most probable number in proportion to the remote ones\n1 It is thus higher than the average age of our informants generally, which is only\n40 years. (See p. 53<)\n\fxil] 243\nDeath-Coincidences.\nseems unlikely. If we look at it the other way, we should infer from\nthe II recent cases that there were really about 29 remote ones ; and\nthat some 22 of those reported were not death-coincidences at all.\nOur numbers are, however, too small to justify us in drawing this\ninference with any confidence; especially as, if we included second-hand\ncases, we should add 3 to the period within ten years, and only 2 to\nthe remoter period. Moreover, we ought not to lose sight of the fact\nthat there are probably special causes tending to reduce the number of\nrecent cases that come to our knowledge. It is not improbable that\nsome may have been withheld from us, owing to a natural reluctance\nto make public experiences which have strongly affected the emotions,\nespecially recently.1 Still we have also to take into account the\npossibility that one or two of the recent cases given were not really\ndeath-coincidences.2\nOn the whole, in view of the evidential defects of many of the\ncases, we are disposed, in order to be on the safe side, to accept a\nreduction to the extent above suggested, and to estimate the whole\nnumber of death-coincidences at 40, instead of 62. From this number\nwe propose, for the purpose of calculating the probability of chance\ncoincidence, to make a further reduction of 8, as a very ample allowance\nfor the selection which, we must assume, may have occurred in some\ncases.3\nBefore concluding this chapter, we must explain to what extent we\nhave made the personal acquaintance of the percipients, and talked\nover their experiences with them, which it has been our wish to do as\nfar as possible in veridical cases. Out of the 62 percipients in the\ndeath-coincidences we are now considering, we have interviewed 21,\n1 From one of our informants who answered \"Yes,\"no further particulars could be\nobtained, because the experience was connected with the recent death of her brother.\nThis may have been a death-coincidence not reported. One alleged death-ooincidence\nwas withheld, though related verbally to the collector, because, not having mentioned\nit to her friends at the time, the percipient was unwilling to make it public now.\ns One of those cut out as a suspicious case, see next Chapter, pp. 246-7, is a recent\ncase in which the coincidence is not clearly made out.\n* We arrive at this number thus : out of 65 cases, as stated on p. 210, 19 were\nknown beforehand to the collector, 26 unknown, and of 20 we cannot say whether\nthey were known or not. Assuming these 20 to be divided between known and\nunknown cases in the same proportion as the 45 of which we have information, we\nmay take 9 as known beforehand. We have therefore 28 known beforehand. Of these,\na* we saw, 5 were certainly not selected and 3 certainly selected, leaving 20 which\nmust be regarded as doubtful. As express instructions were given not to select, it will\nbean outside estimate to assume that half of these were selected, i.e., less than 10 out\nof 62 (besides the 3 known to have been selected, which we excluded at the outset).\nAs the 62 are now reduced\u2014by an allowance for exaggeration\u2014to 40, and as there is\nno reason to suppose selection to have operated more in unexaggerated than in\nexaggerated cases, we think that the diminution of these by 8 will be a more than\nadequate allowance for selection.\nR 2\n\f244 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nand 3 others had been similarly questioned by Mr. Gurney.1 Of the\nothers, 22 were practically inaccessible to us on account of residence\nabroad, 5 on various grounds refused to see us, 2 have apparently\nchanged their address and cannot be got at ; in 6 cases out of the\nremaining 9, it has not on the whole appeared to us worth making a\ntroublesome journey to see the percipients, either because of the length\nof time since the incident, or because it was vaguely remembered, or\nfor unavoidable reasons badly evidenced ; finally, (in 3 cases) we have\nthought the collectors' investigations sufficient.\nThe general result of the interviews we have had in these and other\ncases has been decidedly satisfactory, leading, in almost all cases, to a\nfavourable view of the carefulness and desire for accuracy of the\nwitnesses. In 2 cases, a flaw in the evidence, which had not been\nobserved by the witness, was detected, one being No. 656. 26 (see p. 370),\nalready referred to, reported as a death-coincidence, but proving to be\nan apparition after death, but before the death was known ; and the\nother, No. 460. 1 (see p. 288), which we have still counted as a death-\ncoincidence, but where there is a discrepancy as to the day of the week.\nBut, in most cases, the interview decidedly adds to the evidential value\nof the story, at least in the interviewer's own mind.\n1 In 15 out of the 26 cases iu this Chapter, the percipients have been thus\n.questioned.\n\fna] 245\nChance, Coincidence.\nChapter XIII.\nCHANCE COINCIDENCE.\nWe are now in a position to estimate the improbability that the\ndeath-coincidences are due to chance.\nThe fact that each of us only dies once, enables us to calculate\ndefinitely the probability that that death will coincide with any other\ngiven event, such as the recognised apparition of the dying person.\nTaking as a basis for calculation the average annual death-rate for\nEngland and Wales for the ten years 1881 to 1890, as given in the\nRegistrar General's Report for 1890, namely, 19\"15 per thousand, we\nget as the probability that any one person taken at random would die\non a given day, 19-15 in 365,000, or about 1 in 19,000. This,\nthen, may be taken as the general probability that he will die on the\nday on which his apparition is seen and recognised, supposing that\nthere is no causal connection between the apparition and the death.\nWe ought therefore to find that out of 19,000 apparitions of living\npersons, or persons not more than 12 hours dead, one is a death-\ncoincidence,\u2014occurs, that is, on the day of the death of the person\nseen, and within 12 hours of the death on either side.\nThe number of apparitions of living persons (including persons not\nmore than 1 2 hours dead, if they are not known to the percipient to be\ndead) in the present collection is 381 ; viz., 352 realistic apparitions,\n(see Table IV.), 20 cases, classed as incompletely developed, where the\nfigure or portion of a human figure seen is recognised as representing\na living acquaintance, and 9 visions1 in which a living acquaintance\nappears. But among the percipients in these cases there are some who\nhave experienced more than one hallucination. When these are all\nspecified and enumerated, no confusion in our numbers can, of course,\narise, because each apparition of a recognised human being is counted\namong the 381. But the cases where our informants have experienced\nseveral or many unenumerated hallucinations, some or all of which\nwere- -or at least may have been\u2014apparitions of living persons,\nintroduce an element of uncertainty into the numbers which would\ncomplicate the calculation of the proportion of coincidental to non-\ncoincidental cases. For the purpose of the present discussion, there\nfore, it seemed best to omit them altogether.\nThere are 28 percipients who have had such unenumerated experi\nences among those whose experiences are included in the 381, and the\n1 For the use of this term see the explanation of the Tables at the end of Chapter\nIL ; also Chapter IV., p. 83.\n\f246 Report on the Census of HaJiucinalions. [chap.\nnumber of cases to be cut out on their account is 31,1 of which 7 are\ndeath-coincidences, and were, as it will be remembered, omitted in\nestimating the death-coincidences in the last chapter. Omitting these\n31 cases, our number becomes 350.\nWe now come to the most important correction we have to make\u2014\nthat for lapse of memory. It was shown in Chapter III. that the\nproportion of hallucinations (including perhaps doubtful hallucinations)\nwhich is forgotten or ignored is probably very large. If oblivion\naffected death-coincidences to the same extent that it affects the\naverage of visual hallucinations, it would be unnecessary for us to\ntake it into account\u2014since the ratio of the two would not be altered\nby it. But this is not the case,\u2014as is proved by the distribution in\ntime of the alleged death-coincidences reported (see last chapter,\np. 242), and as might be assumed from the fact that the coincidence\nwould itself impress the hallucination on the memory. Indeed, it is\nclear that the evidence before us does not entitle us to assume that any\ndeath-coincidences at all are forgotten. They may be, and the absence\nof any indication of it may be due to the withholding of recent cases,\nbut we have no sufficient grounds for assuming this. The whole\ncorrection required for oblivion ought, therefore, to be applied to the\n350 recognised apparitions of living persons with which the death-\ncoincidences are to be compared. What this correction should be, is\nnot quite a simple question, as the discussion in Chapter III. (pp. 63-6)\nshowed. The conclusion there arrived at was that in order to form\na fair estimate of the whole number of visual hallucinations occurring\nto persons over 10 years of age, we should multiply the number reported\nby 6\u00a3, if we included what we there called \" suspicious cases,\" that is,\nexperiences which must be regarded as doubtfully hallucinatory on cer\ntain specified grounds, but that the multiplier would be 4 if we excluded\nthese suspicious cases from consideration. Now it is to be observed\nthat such suspicious cases are particularly prevalent among the\nreported apparitions of living persons, so that, if we estimate the\nwhole number of these by multiplying the reported number by 6J, the\nproportion of trivial and doubtfully hallucinatory experiences will be\neven larger than with the visual hallucinations in general ; whereas\namong the 62 death-coincidences discussed in the last chapter, there are\nonly two cases of which the hallucinatory character is doubtful2 on the\n1 Of these, 5 occurred within one year from the time of answering the Census\nquestion, 13 others within ten years, 8 are more remote, and 5 are undated. Of the\ndeath-coincidences thus cut out, 2 occurred within the last ten years, 4 were more re\nmote and 1 is undated.\n2 Taking the three specified grounds of suspicion named at p. 64, viz., (a) the\nfigure seen at some distance either out of doors or in a public room ; (6) the figure seen\npassing outside the door of the room in which the percipient was, or seen inside the\nroom when the percipient passed outside it ; and (c) seen in a bad light and under\n\fSill.] 247\nChance Coincidence.\ngrounds specified. This being so, it is more correct to compare the death-\ncoincidences with the estimated number of recognised hallucinations,\nomitting the suspicious cases on both sides ; and this latter number we\nobtain, for the reasons given in Chapter III., pp. 63-5, by subtracting\nfrom the reported number 8 per cent. for experiences occurring under\nthe age of ten,1 and multiplying the remainder by 4. The number of\nrecognised apparitions thus obtained is 1,288, or, let us say, 1,300.\nWe concluded in the last chapter that, after making ample allow\nance for possible exaggeration and selection, it would be safe to reckon\n32 death-coincidences. To be on the safe side, let us assume\u2014what is\nvery improbable\u2014that the two suspicious cases are both among these\n32 and exclude them. We have then 30 death-coincidences in 1,300\ncases, or about 1 in 43. But chance would, as we have seen, produce\ndeath-coincidences at the rate of 1 in 19,000 apparitions of recognised\nliving persons, and 1 in 43 is equivalent to about 440 in 19,000, or 440\ntimes the most probable number. Or, looking at the matter in a\ndifferent way, we should expect that if death-coincidences only occur\nby chance, it will require 30 times 19,000, or 570,000 apparitions of\nliving persons, to produce 30 such coincidences, and of these we may\nassume that about a quarter, or 142,500 would be remembered. We\nshould therefore expect to have to collect 142,500 cases instead of 350,\nin order to obtain by chance 30 death-coincidences.\nIf we include the suspicious cases, and accordingly multiply the\nreported number of cases by 6J, we get about 1 death-coincidence in\n65, i.e., about 292 times the most probable number.\nThis is the case if we take, as we have done, death-coincidences to\nmean an apparition occurring on the same day as the death of the\nperson seen ; that is within 12 hours of the death. But as a matter\nof fact, the great majority of the coincidences are believed by the\npercipients to be closer than this, as may be seen by examining the 62\ncases (or the 31 printed ones) discussed in the last chapter. The\nimprobability of the apparition occurring by chance within an hour\nof the death, is, of course, twelve times as great as that of its occurring\nwithin 12 hours of it.\nWe conclude then that the number of death-coincidences in our\ncircumstances not otherwise such as to exclude the possibility of mistake, we find in\nthe first place that out of the 62, only 4 occurred out of-doors at all (or 5 if we include\nNo. 379.24, p. 225, when the figure appeared out-of-doors, being seen through a\nwindow), and of these only one comes under the category of \" seen at some\ndistance.\" Under head (6) there are none among the 62, and under head (c) we ought\npossibly to put one case, but not more.\n1 The reasons for excluding these before estimating the correction required for\noblivion are given in Chapter III., p. 65. They are also, it will be remembered, (see\np. 209), excluded from the number of death-coincidences with which we are about\nto compare the whole number of recognised apparitions.\n\f2i8 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\ncollection, if our estimate of them is accepted as fair, is not due to\nchance. This will not be maintained by anyone with the most\nelementary acquaintance with the doctrine of chances. The opponent\nof a telepathic or other supernormal explanation must take one of\nthree other lines of argument. He must either (1) maintain that the\nalleged coincidences are misrepresented as such to a much larger\nextent than we have allowed for, or (2) that they have been sought\nafter by the collectors, and illegitimately introduced into the collection\nto a much larger extent in proportion to non-coincidental cases than\nwe have allowed for; or (3) admitting that the coincidences really\nexist in a proportion sufficient to prove a causal connection between\nthe apparition and the death of the person seen, he may maintain that\nthis connection is not telepathic, but consists in a condition favourable\nto hallucination being produced in the percipient in some normal way\nby the circumstances of the case.\nThe first of these lines of argument can only be met by reference\nto the evidence on which each case rests. This in 26\u2014or in fact 31\n\u2014cases is before the reader, and he must form his own estimate. We\nneed only point out here that the evidence must break down in a\nwholesale way in order to destroy our argument. For the margin on\nthe side against chance is very large, even one death-coincidence being\nmore than we should be justified in expecting chance to produce in a\ncollection ten times the size of ours.\nAs to the second line of argument, we have only to remind the\nreader that in 26 of the death-coincidences, of which 16 are printed\nin the last chapter, our collectors report that they had no previous\nknowledge of the percipient's experience. We may add that in 1 1 of\nthese cases\u2014of which 8, viz., Nos. 425. 12, 442.17, 381.4, 383.24,\n379. 24, 61. 22, 452. 10 (two cases), are among the 27 printed in the\nlast chapter \u2014 we have \u2014 besides the marking of the returns in\naccordance with our instructions \u2014 the positive statement of the\ncollector, confirmed in most cases by circumstances mentioned by him\nwhen questioned, that he did not know of the experience when the\nquestion was put to the percipient. The number of these cases is\nalone sufficient to destroy the argument for chance coincidence, and\nas stated on p. 210, we have strong ground for believing that in some\nof the cases in which it is known that the collector was aware of the\nexperience, this knowledge had no influence on his selection of the\ninformant.\nThe third line of argument\u2014-that death-coincidences really exist\nand are not due to chance, but that the causal connection between\nhallucination and death is not telepathic,\u2014requires careful examination.\nWe saw in Chapter IX., that certain mental and physical states of\nthe percipient are to some extent favourable to hallucinations, and\n\fChance Coincidence. 24!>\nthere can be no doubt that the form of any hallucination that may\noccur is likely to be determined by the subject with which the mind of\nthe percipient is occupied. If, therefore, any mental tension\u2014whether\nit be anxiety, grief, awe, anxious alertness to act lightly in an emer\ngency, or any other such psychological condition\u2014, or any overwrought\nstate of nerves be produced in the percipient by the dying person's\nstate, it is proper to regard it as a possible cause of the hallucination\nand examine it accordingly. But the case can obviously only arise if\nthe percipient is aware of the dying person's condition, and, whatever\nbe the effect of emotion, telepathy will still have to be called in to\nexplain the existence of at least 19 cases among the 62 death-coinci\ndences of which 10 are included in the last chapter,1 in which it\nis positively stated, or clearly implied, that the illness had not been\nheard of at all by the percipient at the time of the apparition. To-\nthese we may reasonably add those cases where though there was (or,\nat least, so far as we know, may have been) knowledge of illness, there\nwas none of danger, and where it is expressly stated, or clearly implied,\nthat there was no anxiety. Such are cases where the percipient either\nbelieves the illness to be trifling, or where it is a long chronic illness\nnot known to be approaching a crisis, and where he cannot therefore\nbe supposed to be emotionally affected. These are 18 in number, of\nwhich 6 are included in the last chapter.2 With them we may reckon\nNo. 579. 24 (see p. 223), where the death was due to suicide, but where\nwe cannot be sure that it was not preceded by illness, and No. 307.20\n(see p. 229), where there is no reason to suppose that there was more\nanxiety than is usual when our friends are on a voyage.\nThere remain 20 cases, of which 8 are included in the last chapter,3\nin which the illness was known to be dangerous, or in which we cannot\nassume that this was not known, and 34 in which the percipient was\notherwise more or less anxious or troubled about the decedent. The\nextent to which the anxiety or trouble really occupied the percipient's\nmind in these 23 cases varies considerably and is sometimes difficult\nto estimate. In some cases (e.g., Nos. 450.18 and 328.5), the anxiety\nwas clearly great. In others (e.g., No. 422.25), the knowledge of the\nserious illness does not seem to have produced emotional anxiety in\n9Nos. 442.17 (p 213), 383. 24 (p. 216), 362.21 (p. 217), 147.23 (p. 218), 379.24\n(p. 225), 630. 5 (p. 227), 83. 21 (p. 228), 61. 22 (p. 232), 730. 24 (p. 233), 452. 10 (second\ncase, p. 238). These cases are none of them under suspicion of having been selected\nby the collector. In 7 of them we have positive evidence to the contrary.\n2 Nos. 425. 12 (p. 211), 215. 9 (p. 224), 418. 4 (p. 230), 571. 14 (p. 237), 452. 10\n(first case, p. 238), 579. 25 (p. 241).\n'Nos. 422.25 (p. 227), 523.12 (p. 231), 645.11 (p. 233), 450.18 (p. 234), 328.5\n(P- 235), 725. 6 (p. 237), 385. 20 (p. 239), 191. 3 (p. 240).\n'Noe. 381. 4 (p. 214), and 460. 1 (p. 288), are two of them.\n\f250 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nthe percipient at all, on account of the absence of emotional relation\nbetween the percipient and the decedent ; but though this makes\nthe anxiety\u2014if it can be called so\u2014less important, it also makes a\ntelepathic explanation less plausible, so that we had better consider\ntogether all the cases where there was knowledge of serious illness,\nwhether this knowledge produced emotional anxiety or not, or where\nthere is reason to think that the percipient's mind was specially\noccupied with the decedent.\nThe question before us is : granting that anxiety aud other\namotions, or concentration of the mind on particular persons, are\ncauses of hallucinations representing the person exciting the state of\nmind, ought we to assume that where such a state,\u2014let us say\nanxiety,\u2014is present, it sufficiently accounts for a death-coincidence!\nIt is clear that the answer must largely depend on the duration of the\nanxiety as compared with the interval between the hallucination and\nthe death. If the anxiety remains much the same for several days,\nthe hallucination will not occur on the day of the death, and at no\nother time during that period, without some reason other than the\nanxiety, and, similarly, if the anxiety is unchanged for several hours\nand the hallucination occurs within a few minutes of the death, the\ncoincidence, if frequent, needs accounting for. There may, no doubt,\nbe cases where a period of culmination of emotion or fatigue occurs at\nthe time of death comparable in duration to the interval between\ndeath and hallucination, and when this is so, the subjective causation\nof the hallucination may be regarded as equally probable with the tele\npathic. But this does not happen to be the case in any of the death-\ncoincidences with which we are now concerned, and in our opinion,\ntherefore, anxiety will not account for even those in our collection in\nwhich it was acute.1\nIt must be regarded as confirmatory of this view that, out of the\n50 apparitions in the whole collection that occurred to our informants\nduring anxiety (or presumable anxiety) of the percipient about the\nperson whose figure was seen, 31 2 are reported to have coincided with\nthe latter's death\u2014a proportion which must be greatly in excess of\n1 The strongest instance of anxiety, is perhaps No. 407. 2. The death had been\nhourly expected since the morning. From noon till evening, the percipient had\nwatched by her dying cousin, and then had to return to her own house next door to\nrest, in preparation for her work next day as a teacher. Some time after she was in\nbed, she saw the figure of her cousin, at once got up and dressed, and, as she left the\nroom, met the news that all was over.\n- This includes 8 cases not reckoned in the G2 death-coincidences, because in 2 of\nthem the percipient was, or may have been, aware that the death was actually at that\nmoment taking place ; in 3 the percipient either was under 10 years of age or had had\nunenumerated experiences : and the other 3 are the ones in which we have evidence\npointing to special selection by the collectors.\n\fXlli.J 2.51\nChance Coincidence.\nthe frequency with which anxiety is terminated by the death, and not\nby the recovery, of the person inspiring it. It is further significant\nthat, of the remaining 19 cases, 11 occurred when the person seen\nproved to be on his death-bed, though he did not die within the 12\nhours which we have taken as the limit for death-coincidences.1\nThe reader should bear in mind that when we affirm telepathy to\nhave operated in any particular case, we do not intend thereby to\nexclude the action of other causes and conditions,\u2014such as those\nexamined in Chapters IX. and X. Indeed, the operation of other\ncauses besides telepathy is sometimes obviously required to explain the\nbizarre form occasionally taken by seemingly telepathic communications.\nIt is therefore quite likely that anxiety,\u2014with other things which\ndirect the thoughts of the percipient to the agent,\u2014may facilitate\ntelepathic communication ; but except in very special cases, of which\nwe have none in the present collection, it will not by itself account\nfor the coincidence of the hallucination with the death.\n1 It is worth analysing the remaining 8 cases. Three of them occurred during\nillness of the person seen, but we have no information as to whether the illness\nended fatally or not. One (No. 6!). 14, see p. 105) coincided with a serious danger\nto the person seen, suggesting a possible telepathio explanation. Two are cases\nwhere the percipient was awaiting the arrival of the person seen. (One of these\nis Ifo. 317. 14, see p. 308.) The anxiety was by no means acute in either case, and\nthere was in both a slight element of coincidence, which makes the interpretation\ndoobtful. In another, the percipient saw a friend, and states that he was anxious,\nhat does not say on what subject. In the remaining case, (No. 426. 13, see p. 167)\nthe person whose phantasm was seen appears to have been in no exceptional\ncondition at the time.\n\f252 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nChapter XIV.\nVERIDICAL HALLUCINATIONS CONTINUED : FURTHER\nCOINCIDENTAL CASES.\nIn the last two chapters we limited ourselves to a special class of\ncoincidences, namely, recognised apparitions of a dying person seen\nwithin 12 hours of the death, in order to base a calculation upon\nthem. The evidence for telepathy\u2014or some other supernormal cause\n\u2014afforded by the Census does not, however, rest on these cases alone ;\nand in the present chapter we shall give selected instances of halluci\nnations which do not fall within the class above defined, but which\nyet either coincide with some external event in such a manner as to\nsuggest a causal connection between them, or else convey some in\nformation previously unknown to the percipient.\nBut before leaving the subject of recognised visual death-\ncoincidences, we may conveniently lay before the reader the three\ncases which we excluded from the last two chapters (see p. 210)\nbecause there was some reason to believe that the percipients were\nasked the Census question owing to their having had an experience.\nIn all of them the coincidence was well made out, and appears to\nhave been very close. They are the following :\u2014\n(61. 6.) From Mrs. G.\n\" I saw my mother, exactly as she was some few months before (when she\nlived with me), standing at my bedside. She touched me, but when I spoke\nto her and tried to touch her, she immediately vanished. This took place\nin January, 1883.

I was not aware of what she was doing at the time. My\nmother died at the exact time I saw her at my bedside, as I found next\nmorning.\n\" No other person was in the room at the moment I felt the touch of her\nhand ; but one of my daughters, coming in just afterwards, saw nothing ;\ntook note of exact time, which was 9.10 p.m.\n\"I have never since had a similar experience.\"\nThe lady through whom this case was obtained informed us that she\nhad first heard the account from the daughter referred to, who told her\nthat on going into her mother's room she had found her talking,\napparently to someone at the foot of her bed. Her mother asked her if she\ncould see anyone, but she saw nothing. They had a telegram next morning\nsaying that Mrs. G.'s mother had died at the time the apparition was seen.\nMiss G. was then about 16. Mrs. G. had some ground for serious anxiety\nwith regard to her mother's health, but the death was quite unexpected.\n\fay.] 253\nDeath \u25a0Coincidences.\nThe account was written in May or June, 1889. It is in the handwriting\nofthe daughter, and is signed by Mrs. G. herself.\nMrs. 6., who is now an invalid, was unwilling to see any member of the\nCommittee on the subject.\n(301. 6.) From Mrs. Wilde.\n10. Golborne-street, Warrington, Mai\/ 1st. 1890.\n\"On November 7th, 1883, I was sitting in the evening nursing my baby,\nwhen my brother-in-law, who I knew was at the time very ill, suddenly\nappeared, raised his arm, and then vanished. He was without his coat, as I\nhad often seen him at his own home. I went at once to his house, and was\ntold that he had just died. He was very fond of me, and during his illness\nhad often said that he wished he could come and see me.\n\" I was quite well, very anxious about my brother, but not thinking about\nMm at the time. I was 30 years old. I had only my baby with me at the\nrime.\n\" That was the only time I had such an experience.\n\"Catherine Mary Wilde.\"\nMr. Wilde corroborates as follows :\u2014\n\" I beg to certify that I remember my wife relating to me shortly after\nmy brother-in-law's death the circumstance already given relating to the\nsame.\n\"Thomas Wilde.\"\nMrs. Sidgwick writes :\u2014\nDecember 18th, 189L\n\" I have to-day seen Mrs. Wilde and questioned her as to her experience.\nShe seems a good witness. Her brother-in-law, whose name was Thomas\nHatch, died of bronchitis (added to some degree of consumption), and was\ndelirious during the last few days of his life. He was attended by a\nprofessional nurse, but Mrs. Wilde saw him frequently, and he seemed to\nrecognise her when she came into the room. On one occasion he got up in\nbed and said he was coming round to have a cup of tea with her. She\nl)elieves she had seen him on the day he died more than once. She knew\nlie was expected to die, but did not realise it as likely to be immediate\nnor had she any idea that she had seen him for the last time. The kitchen\nin which she sat had a doorway into the lobby with no door. She looked\nup and saw him in the doorway quite distinctly (' not like a shadow ') just\nas she was accustomed to see him before he was ill, in his shirt sleeves.\n\u2022She saw him raise his arm (as though to beckon, I think she said). At the\nfirst moment she really thought it was he ; then she was frightened and\nlooked away and saw him no more. She was so startled by the incident that\nshe went round instantly to her sister's house, not three minutes off, for the\nsake of company, not with any idea of finding her brother-in-law dead. She\nasked how he was and was told he had just died. No one was with her when\nshe had the experience, but she told her husband soon after.\"\nWe have verified the date of death through the Warrington Advertiser\nof November 10th, 1883, which gives, under Deaths, \" November 7th, aged\n29 years, Mr. T.

[chap.\nAfter the above account was given, Mrs. Wilde had another possibly\nveridical experience\u2014of an auditory hallucination\u2014which she thus\ndescribes :\u2014\nApril 7th, 1892.\n\"Just before I got up, on the morning of the 28th January, 1892, I\nheard my name called distinctly (Kate). I thought it was my husband's\nvoice, and throwing something on went quickly down. I noticed the time\nby the large clock in Sankey-street, which is plainly visible from our door ;\nit was then a quarter to eight. Mr. Wilde was not in the house, and did\nnot come in for nearly an hour. About eleven o'clock that morning news\nwas brought of the death of Mrs. L., the lady whose business I was\nmanaging. She died at a quarter to eight, the time I heard the voice\ncalling me.\n\"C. M. Wn.DK.\"\nA mourning card, giving the date of death, was sent with this account.\n(350. 1.) From Mr. T. J. Hay.\nTower House, Millbrook, Southampton, June 24f\/t, 1890.\n\"It is long ago\u2014I think in 1845. One evening I took a candle and\nwent downstairs, when I thought I met my great-aunt, who I was aware\nwas seriously ill. I talked of this at the time with my mother and brother,\nand probably also my sister. Early the next morning the footman brought\nword that the poor old lady died the previous evening, about the hour when\nI fancied I saw her. [I was] in good health, [age] 19 years.\n\"Thomas J. Hay.\"\nMr. Hay informed us further that this is the only hallucinatory\nexperience he has ever had, and that his brother was present, but did not\nshare in the experience. His brother, through whom the collector first\nheard of the case, writes :\u2014\n'' I was present with my brother when the so-called vision took place,\nbut I did not see it.\n\"H. W. Hat.\"\nProfessor Sidgwick gives the following account. written from notes taken\nat the time, of an interview which he had with the percipient :\u2014\nMarch 23rd, 1892.\n\" I called yesterday morning on Mr. T. J. Hay at the Tower House. He\ntold me he only regarded the matter as a strange coincidence.\n\" It happened thus. He had been sitting in the evening with his mother\nand sister, but had left them for a brief interval, and it was during this\ninterval that he saw the figure of his aunt. He was well aware that she was\ndangerously ill, but was not in emotional anxiety. The appearance was quite\nclear and definite, just as though she were there in the body : but knowing\nthis to be impossible, he had a ' creepy ' feeling, though not a nervous man.\nIt lasted about half a minute, and then vanished. He went back into the\nsitting-room, and told his mother and sister, saying, ' I fear something has\nhappened to Aunt Fanny. ' At the same time he regarded the experience as\na mere hallucination. He has never had any other hallucination, nor, so far\n\fXIV.] 255\nVoices coinciding with Death.\nas he knows, has any member of his family. When the butler came the next\nmorning with the news of his aunt's death, he asked the time of it, and found\nit about the same as the time of the appearance.\"\nRecognised Auditory and Tactile Death-Coincidences.\nThe next group of cases are auditory hallucinations, in which a\nroice is heard at the time of a death, and either recognised as that of\nthe dying person, or distinctly associated with him. There are 15 of\nthese in our collection, not counting those in which a recognised\napparition is accompanied by a voice. In 10 of them, what is heard\nis the percipient's name only, and in the remainder, other words.\nOne of the 15 cases (No. 83. 3) was published in Phantasms of the\nLiving, Vol. II., p. 564, where it is numbered 616 ; another has been\nalready printed in Chapter X., p. 179 ; the following are, we think,\nthe three best cases among the others.\n(131. 11.) From Mrs. Smith.\n38, Gillingham-street, Pimlico, S.W., September 9th, 1890.\n\" [I heard] a voice calling my name three times on board the Runnymede,\nhomeward bound from Australia. 10 p.m., 1874, March 9th.

Mr. Podmore called on her, and gives the\nfollowing account of his interview :\u2014\nFebruary 4th, 1891.\n\"I heard the story from Mrs. Smith and her husband yesterday. Both\nare good witnesses, and intelligent. I enclose newspaper extract about the\nfire. The Runnymede was a barque sailing from Brisbane, and belonged\n(Mrs. Smith thinks, but is not sure) to the Shaw and Savile line. It was a\nwool-ship, and the fire broke out in the wool. The fire broke out, they\nagreed, about half an hour after the voice. The voice was distinctly re\ncognised as that of Mrs. Smith's mother. The name called was ' Lizzie.'\nThe agent's name was Ann Youens. I saw a printed memorial card\ngiving the date of her death, March 9th, 1874.\"\nThe newspaper cutting referred to gives under the head of ' ' Shipping\nIntelligence \" :\u2014\n\"(from Lloyd's, april 15.) wrecks and casualties.\n' ' Pernambuco (per telegraph, Lisbon, April 14). A fire broke out on\nboard the Runnymede, from Brisbane to London, loading wool, and tin ore,\nbut was extinguished with little damage to vessel ; extent of damage to cargo\nnot yet ascertained. She has been surveyed, and has discharged part of her\ncargo ; cause of fire unknown.\"\nThe fact that the voice and the fire occurred on the same night is\nlikely to have fixed the date in the mind of the percipient ; and this\ndiminishes in the present case the evidential weakness which\u2014if no\nnote is taken at the time\u2014usually attaches to cases where a consider\nable interval elapses between the hallucination and the receipt of the\nnews of the death. In the next case there can have been no mistake\nas to coincidence, since the news was received by telegram at once.\n(23. 11.) From Mr. Eggie.\nWalbottle, May, 1889.\n\" On October 5th, 1863, I awoke at 5 a.m. I was in Minto House\nNormal School, Edinburgh. I heard distinctly the well-known and charac\nteristic voice of a dear friend, repeating the words of a well-known hymn.\nNothing [was] visible. [I was] lying quite awake in bed\u2014in good health,\nand free from any special anxiety. There would be two others in the room,\nbut sound asleep.\n\" I have always thought it remarkable that at the very same time, almost\nto a minute, my friend was seized suddenly with mortal illness. He died\nsame day, and a telegram reached me that evening announcing that fact.\nHe had previously been in his usual good health.\n\"Jno. Eggie.\"\nMr. Eggie is a certificated schoolmaster at Walbottle. In answer to our\nfurther inquiries he writes :\u2014\nWalbottle, May 24th, 1889.\n\" I cannot produce any independent testimony of any kind regarding the\nincident. It rests entirely on my own word, which, of course, in a scientific\ninvestigation, is worth nothing. My replies would be as follows :\u2014\n\fXIV.] 2.57\nVoices coinciding with Death.\n\" I mentioned it to no one before the death.\n\" The friend was my father. He died on October 5th, 1863. The cauno\nof death was, I believe, certified as the bursting of a blood-vessel.\n\"The sudden death was mentioned at the time in the Dundee news-\npapers, but I have no copy of one of them.\n\"The words had something peculiarly appropriate about them, but,\nso far as I know, there was no special association.\n\"You will see that most probably my father would at least be thinking\na good deal about me that day. He did not speak, I believe, after the\nseizure.\"\nProfessor Sidgwick writes :\u2014\nSeptember 23rd, 1891.\n\"Yesterday, at 5.45 p.m., I had an interview with Mr. Eggie. He read\nover his paper, and suggested modifications of one or two phrases, which he\nthought perhaps needed slightly qualifying.\n\"Thus, with regard to 'no anxiety,' Mr. Eggie thought he ought to\nmention that his father had been ill at the previous Christmas-time\u2014had\nburst a blood-vessel ; but he had recovered from this, and was believed to\nbe in normal health. Mr. Eggie had had a letter from him a day or two\nbefore, which gave not the slightest ground for anxiety. Still, though he\nhad no ground for special anxiety, there might have been a faint general\nanxiety on account of the previous illness.\n\" Again, in his statement of the exactness of the coincidence, he thought\n'almost ' should be inserted before 'to a minute.' But he felt sure of the\ncloseness of the coincidence, for the following reasons :\u2014\n\" (1.) He knew the time of the voice from hearing the chimes of St. Giles's\nChurch very shortly after. (2.) The time of the seizure he learnt when he\nwent home for the funeral ; and it was fixed in his mind by the following\ncircumstances. The father was engaged in farming, and the day of the\nfatal illness was market day ; he consequently rose earlier than usual, and\nwas making himself some breakfast when the seizure occurred ; he never\nbecame conscious again, and he died at 2 p.m. on the same day.\n\"The voice repeated two complete stanzas of the hymn.\n\" An entry by which Mr. Eggie knows the date was in the fly-leaf of a\nBible ; it must have been made very shortly after the death. He heard of\nthe death by telegraph on the same day ; a letter followed ; but neither\nmentioned the exact time of the death. He has had no similar experience,\neither before or after.\"\nThis case is a death-coincidence, as the hallucination occurred\nwithin seven hours of the death ; but the almost exact agreement in\ntime between the hallucination and the seizure suggests that it was the\ncrisis of the seizure rather than of the death which caused the tele\npathic impulse.\nIn the following case, again, the receipt of the news followed the\nhallucination so closely that there can have been no mistake as to the\ncoincidence.\ns\n\f258 Report on the Census of HoMucincdions. [chap.\n(55. 18.) From the Rev. J. Maskell.\n(The account was written in 1889).\nEmanuel Hospital, Westminster.\n\" On 30th October, 1857, while Curate of Gain's Colne, Essex, I was\nsitting in my room, in lodgings, in a lonely half-occupied farmhouse, about\n7 p.m., when I heard the voice of a parishioner, whom I well knew, calling\nme from the outside, under my window, 'Mr. Maskell, I want you ; come.'\nI went out, but saw no one, and thought no more of it, till about 9 p.m.\nI was sent for by the man's wife, distant nearly a mile, and then learned\nthat the man J. B. had been found dead in the roadway from Chappie\nStation to the village\u2014a long distance from my abode, perhaps a mile\nor more.\n\" [I was] reading, and in good health.\n\"J. B. was a cattle dealer, and I saw him frequently, both in his place\nin church, and out of it. I had no knowledge of his occupation at 7 p.m.\non Saturday, October 30th, 1857.\n\" A lad who was my pupil [was present] ; he had no share in the experience.\n\" I took no notes. The man J. B. was supposed to have been murdered,\nand at the inquest the verdict was ' Wilful murder against some person\nor persons unknown.' The motive for the murder was robbery, as he had\nsold much cattle, and was returning with money from Colchester Market.\n\"J. Maskell.\"\nWe have verified the fact that October 30th, 1857, was a Saturday.\nMr. Maskell is now no longer living, but through the kindness of Miss\nMaskell we have been able to obtain a copy of the inscription on the\nmurdered man's tomb in the churchyard of Colne Engaine, Halstead, Essex,\nwhich gives the date of his death as October 31st, 1857. The circumstances\nof the death seem to make it certain that it was on Saturday night, and not\non Sunday, that the man was killed, so that we must suppose the day of\nthe month on the tombstone to be wrong.\nMiss Maskell says :\u2014\n\"[My father] was, I know, much impressed with the occurrence, and\nseldom spoke of it; but, if necessary, I could have given you data, &c.\"\nThe following case is the nearest approach among our cases to a\nrecognised tactile hallucination coinciding with a death, but, as will be\nseen, it was not the touch that was connected with the dying person,\nbut an accompanying mental impulse, much more impressive than the\ntouch and of which the touch seemed to be a subsidiary part.\n(338. 26.) From Miss L. D.\nSeptember 4th, 1890.\n\"On September 3rd, 1858, I was in a wild part of the West Highlands,\nwhere our home was, close to the sea. A party of cousins were with us, on\na visit. I and a sister and one of our guests, a girl of 16, went out on the\nhills, to a point where we could look over the Sound of Mull. We sat on\nthe turf looking at the view. I and my cousin made an outline sketch.\n[Then] she rose and walked a little further to join my sister. I was left\n\fxrv\\] 259\nTouches coinciding with Death.\nalone, and an impulse came over me to pray for a brother, a sailor\u2014he was\nin the West Indies at the time. I heard no sound, but I felt a sensation as\nif something touched me. I obeyed and prayed for his safe keeping (his\nship was on its way home). I said nothing to the others, but I did look at\nmy watch : it was 3.30 p.m.\n\"On September 7th a letter from this brother came. He hoped to\nbe with us in a few weeks, but they had been coaling at St. Thomas, and\nyellow fever was raging there ; several cases on board his own ship, though\nnone were very severe. His letter was dated on a late day in August\n(25th, I think). On September 21st, our guests having all left us, a letter\ncame from the authorities at Portsmouth, stating that on September 3rd\nhe had died of yellow fever on his voyage home, and his body had been\ncommitted to the deep on the same day. He had been taken ill just after\nwriting his last letter, and as he was a young fellow of 19, the surgeon\nthought his best chance was to be sent off at once, so he was carried on\nboard and died on the second day at sea, September 3rd. The exact hour\nwas not known, for the boy was left asleep in his berth, and found dead by\none of his fellow-officers.\n\" The shock was great to my mother\u2014we could not talk much to her.\nJust after Christmas my mother and I went to stay with old friends and con\nnections at a beautiful place close to Dunbar. Of course the sad event was\ntnlked over by my mother and our hostess. I was sitting by the first time\nthey spoke, and heard my mother say, that about 3 o'clock on September 3rd\nshe was sitting talking to her friend (the mother of the girl who walked out\nwith me). Each had a sailor-boy, and they were talking of those two absent\nones. Then they agreed to go out and walk, and my mother had got on her\nthings, and was leaving her room to join her friend, when (I quote her\nwords) 'a hand seemed to force me to turn back, and I went and knelt\ndown and prayed for my boy. I did not know why, but I just prayed\nhe might be safe.' When I got her alone, I told her about our walk and\nmy own experience. I had never done so till then, she had been so ill\nand upset. Neither of us had a doubt but that this ' message ' was sent to\nus just as the young spirit passed alone into the Unseen World. We heard\nno voice and saw nothing, but we were aware of an unusual sensation, which\ncould not be resisted. I can only call it 'an uncontrollable impulse.'\n\" My mother died last year, and all the persons except one, who were\nwith us on that day, are dead too. The exception is that young cousin, but\nI do not think I ever told her. I was 24 years old.\"\nIt is an interesting feature in this case that the experience\napparently occurred to two percipients in different places simul\ntaneously, but the second percipient being dead, it has, of course, been\nimpossible to obtain her evidence at first-hand.\nApparitions, not of the Dying Person, Coinciding with Death.\nIn the next group of cases, an apparition coinciding with the death\nrepresents, not the dying person herself, but a near relative of hers.\nThere are four cases of this type in the Census; of these, one was\ns 2\n\f260 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\npublished in Phantasms of the Living, Vol. I., p. 357 (No. 124), and\ntwo others are given below.\nSuch cases need present no difficulty on the telepathic theory.\nIndeed it may be rather said that the absence of any cases of the kind\nwould render the theory improbable. They raise the question, however,\nwho the \"agent\"\u2014-the person, that is, from whom the telepathic\ncommunication comes\u2014is, in hallucinations coinciding with a death.\nUsually it seems natural to assume that it is the dying person, and in\nsome cases\u2014as we have seen in Chapter XII\u2014this view is supported\nby evidence that the dying person's thoughts were specially directed to\nthe percipient. The mere fact, however, that the apparition represents\na particular person does not prove that that person was the agent. It\nis possible for an agent to transfer to a percipient an image of some\nthird person, and it is possible for a percipient to embody an impression\ntelepathically received in a form suggested by his own mind and not\nby the agent's. As an instance where it seems improbable that the\nperson whose figure was seen was the agent, see Mrs. McAlpine's\nvision of her baby nephew at the time of its death (printed at p. 281)\nafter another experience of the same percipient.) It seems more likely\nin this case that the agent was some one with the child, than the child\nitself, aged six months. In one of the death coincidences quoted in\nChapter XII., (No. 579. 24, p. 223), there is some reason for thinking\nthat the agent was the sister who telegraphed the news rather than the\ndecedent; because (1) the hallucination nearly coincided in time with\nthe despatch of the telegram, while it occurred some hours after the\ndeath, and (2) it foretold the arrival of the telegram. These cases,\nof course, differ from those we are about to quote, in that the appa\nrition is of the dying person, but they should be kept in view in\ninterpreting them.\n(341. 21.) From Miss W.\nOctober 11th, 1891.\n\"It was one Sunday morning at church, during morning service. I\nlooked up from my Prayer-book and saw the figure of a man standing in what\nhad been an empty seat opposite me. He turned half round and looked at\nme with a fixed, agonised gaze. I felt perturbed and very annoyed at his\nbehaviour, when he bowed his head as though something were passing over\nhim, and, to my utter astonishment, vanished. This was on Sunday,\n, 1885. I was singing the Psalms, with my brother sharing\nthe same book. I was in good health, and quite free from grief or anxiety.\nMy age was 22:\n\" The appearance was that of an acquaintance of mine, who from his\nseat m church was much given to staring at me during service. I heard\nafterwards that at that exact time he was at the deathbed of his mother.\n\" This was the only occasion [on which I have had such an experience].\n\fxiv.] Apparitio-ns coinciding vrith other Deaths. 261\nMiss W. , in answer to further questions, informed us that she did not\nknow that Mr. 's mother was ill. She had been delicate for years, but\nshe had not heard that she was at all less strong then than usual.\nMrs. Sidgwick called on Miss W. on December 5th, 1891, and gives the\nfollowing account, written at once, of what she heard from her :\u2014\n\"Miss W. was at the west end of the church. The figure appeared in\nthe choir at the opposite side, so that she had a three-quarters view of it, as\nit were. It was the gentleman's usual seat. She had the impulse to say to\nher brother : ' How could Mr. have got there without our seeing him\ngoing across 1 ' but restrained herself because of the way he was looking at\nher, which made her iingry. She thinks the appearance may have lasted\nthrough half a Psalm, but is not sure. I think she most likely did not keep\nher eyes on it, and when she looked again it was gone. Anyhow, she\ncannot give any account of its vanishing ; it was just not there. Only then\ndid she realise that what she had seen was not real, and it gave her a shock.\nShe had a difficulty in standing through the remainder of the Psalms, her\nknees shook so much ; but looking over the same book with her brother, she\nwould not give way. She had no unusual feelings before the figure vanished.\nHer sight is good and she would see a real person quite clearly at that\ndistance.\n\" She heard, when she got home, that Mrs. \u2014\u2014 had died that morning,\nat the time she saw her son, as she believes.\n\" She has never told anyone of this experience, so that no further\nevidence can be obtained. \"\nWe have verified the date of Mrs. 's death independently through\na local paper.\nIn this case the coincidence appear to have been very close. In the\nabsence of evidence either from Mr. or his mother, it is not\npossible for us to feel sure which was the agent. The fact that Mrs.\nwas more clearly passing through a crisis is an argument for\nsupposing that the telepathic impression came from her, but on the\nother hand there is reason to think that Mr. and the percipient\nwere more interested in each other than the dying lady and the\npercipient were, and his thoughts may well have turned to her at the\nmoment of his mother's death.\nIn the next case the fact that the person whose figure was seen can\nhardly by any normal means have known of his mother's death at the\ntime of the hallucination makes it difficult to suppose that he was\nthe agent, without a telepathic hypothesis so complicated as to be\nextremely improbable.\n(338. 20.) From Miss C. L. Hawkins-Dempster.\n(The account was written in 1890).\n24, Portman-square, W.\n\"I ran downstairs and entered the drawing-room at 7.30 p.m., believing\nI had kept my two sisters waiting for dinner. They had gone to dinner, the\n\f262 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nroom was empty. Behind a long sofa I saw Mr. H. standing. He moved 3\nsteps nearer. I heard nothing. I was not at all afraid or surprised, only\nfelt concern as [to] what he wanted, as he was in South America. I learnt\nnext moaning that at that moment his mother was breathing her last. I\nwent and arranged her for burial, my picture still hanging above the bed,\nbetween the portraits of her two absent sons.\n\" I was in the habit of hearing often from [Mr. H.], and was not at that\nmoment anxious about Mrs. H.'s health, though she was aged.\n' ' 1 had had 25 days before the grief of losing an only brother. No [other\npersons were present at the time].\n\"C. L. H. Dempster.\"\nIn answer to further inquiries, we learnt from Miss Hawkins-Dempster\nthat the above incident occurred on New Year's Eve, 1876-77 ; the room was\nlighted by \" one bright lamp and a fire,\" and the figure did not seem to go\naway, she merely \"ceased to see it.\" She used to see Mrs. H. often, and\nwas in no anxiety as to her health at the time. Mrs. H. was very old, but\nnot definitely ill. Miss Hawkins-Dempster corrected her first statement as\nto the exactness of the coincidence by informing us that Mrs. H. died in the\nmorning of the same day on which the apparition was seen.\nMiss Hawkins-Dempster mentioned what she had seen to her sister, who\nthus corroborates :\u2014\nMy loth, 1892.\n\" I heard of my sister Miss C. L. Hawkins-Dempster's vision of Mr. H.\nin the drawing-room at 7.30 p.m. on New Year's Eve, 1876-7, immediately\nafter it happened, and before hearing that Mrs. H. died the same day, the\nnews of which reached us later that evening. \" H g tj)emp8TEE \u00bb\nWe have verified the date of death at Somerset House.\nMiss Hawkins-Dempster has had one other experience. While sitting\nat luncheon with her sister and their governess, they all saw their hostess,\nwho was, in fact, writing in her own room, and probably conscious that she\nwas late for luncheon, enter the room. She actually came in about ten\nminutes later. This occurred in 1848 or 1849.\nMr. Myers had an interview with the Misses Hawkins-Dempster on\nJuly 16th, 1892, and writes as follows the next day :\u2014\n\" Miss C. Hawkins-Dempster's veridical experience is well remembered\nby both sisters. The decedent was a very old lady, who was on very intimate\nterms with them, and had special reasons for thinking of Miss C. Hawkins-\nDempster in connection with the son whose figure appeared. He was at the\nother side of the world, and almost certainly had not heard of his mother's\ndeath at the time.\n\"The figure was absolutely life-like. Miss Hawkins-Dempster noticed\nthe slight cast of the eye and the delicate hands. The figure rested one\nhand on the back of a chair and held the other out. Miss Hawkins-\nDempster called out, ' What can I do for you 1 ' forgetting for the moment\nthe impossibility that it could be the real man. Then she simply ceased to\n.see the figure.\n\fXIV.] 263\nUnrecognised coincident Apparitions.\n\" She was in good health at the time, and her thoughts were occupied\nwith business matters.\"\nHere the apparition followed the death by some hours ; so that, if\nMrs. H. was the agent, the telepathic impression must either have\nremained latent for some time, or have been produced by the agent\nafter death. In this the case resembles other death-coincidences in\nwhich the apparition followed the death. This class of experiences will\nbe further discussed in Chapter XVII.\nUnrecognised Hallucinations coinciding with Death.\nWe come next to cases in which the hallucinatory figure or voice\nwhich coincides with a death is unrecognised, or in which the\ncoinciding (visual) hallucination does not amount to a human figure\nat all.\nWe have in our present collection two cases where a human figure\nseen at the time of death is not recognised as representing any known\nperson. In the first of these, the dying person was one whom the\npercipient had never even heard of, and therefore could not be\nexpected to recognise.\n(317. 6.) From Miss S. Money.\n(The account was written in 1890).\n47, Upper Baker-street, Regent's Park, N.W.\n\"At Redhill, on Thanksgiving Day, between 8 and 9 in the evening,\nwhen I was taking charge of the little daughter of a friend, during [my] friend's\nabsence for that evening, I left the child sleeping in the bedroom, and went\nto drop the blinds in two neighbouring rooms, being absent about three\nminutes. On returning to the child's room, in the full light of the gas-\nbumer from above I distinctly saw, coming from the child's cot, a white\nfigure, which figure turned, looked me full in the face, and passed down the\nstaircase. I instantly followed, leaned over the banisters in astonishment,\nand saw the glistening of the white drapery as the figure passed down the\nstaircase, through the lighted hall, and silently through the hall door itself,\nwhich was barred, chained, and locked. I felt for the moment perfectly\nstaggered, went back to the bedroom, and found the child peacefully sleep\ning. I related the circumstance to the mother immediately on her return\nlate that night. She was incredulous, but said that my description of the\nfigure answered to that of an invalid aunt of the child's. The next morning\ncame a telegram to say that this relative, who had greatly wished to see her\nniece, had died between 8 and 9 the previous evening.\n\" I had just put down the Pickwick Papers with which I had been\nwhiling the time, was free from trouble, and in good health.\n\" No one was in the house but myself, the child, and one servant, who,\nat the time, was in the kitchen, dressed in black.\n\f264 Report on the Census of HalhuAnations.

Money.\"\nIn answer to our inquiries, the collector, Miss B. Garnett writes :\u2014\nHighlands, Clarendon-road, Lewisham, S.E., December 20th, 1890.\n' ' I obtained lately an interview with Miss Money, and wrote down her\nreplies to the four questions enclosed. This was all the information she was\nable to give. I should state that Miss Money's rather interesting experience\nwas told me long before I was asked to collect answers for the Society, and\nthen merely was told by her in the course of conversation, when I had been\nexpressing my scepticism about all so-called spiritual manifestations. She\nthen said she had been utterly sceptical until she herself met with this\nexperience.\"\nThe replies enclosed were :\u2014\n\" 1. The child's mother died about 10 or 11 years ago.\n\" 2. Miss Money did not even know of the existence of the aunt at the\ntime of [her] experience.\n\"3. Miss Money has scruples about giving the name without permission.\nShe states that the aunt was a single woman, and a step-sister of the father\nof the child, and that the aunt was not living near.\n\"4. As the lady (the aunt) was no acquaintance of Miss Money's, and as\nshe heard no further details, she knows of no further way of proving the\nfact. Miss Money lost sight of the parents, having been abroad herself for\nmany years afterwards.\"\nMiss Garnett says further, in speaking of the original account, which was\nfirst given to her verbally by Miss Money, \" It was clearly and repeatedly\ngiven, amid many critical suggestions on my part. I may add that Miss\nMoney's testimony on any subject is one that I have always found reliable.\nI merely add this because there are so many people who seem scarcely able\nto help exaggerating in the direction of the particular bias of their minds.\"\nMr. Podmore called on Miss Money on February 2nd, 1892, and heard\nfull particulars of the incident from her. He further ascertained that no\ncorroboration is now obtainable, and that Miss Money has failed to obtain\npermission to give the name of the lady who died. We have therefore been\nunable to verify the date of the death.\nIn this case, it is said that the percipient's \" description of the\nfigure answered to that of \" the decedent. We cannot lay much stress\non such a supposed correspondence, but if there really was any\nmaterial resemblance, it may be compared to cases where some veridical\ndetail not previously known to the percipient is introduced into a\ncoincidental apparition, as the \" waistcoat with the shiny back \" in\nNo. 571. 14 (see p. 237), the dressing-gown in No. 147. 23 (see p. 218),\n\fXIV.] 265\nUnrecognised coincident Apparitions.\nand the details of the scene in No. 362. 21 (see p. 217). Where\nthe appearance of the phantasm presents no details that could not\nhave been evolved from the percipient's own mind, all that we have\nto suppose transferred from the one mind to the other is\u2014to use Mr.\nGurney's phrase {Phantasms of the Living, Vol. I., p. 537)\u2014a dim and\nshadowy idea ; the particular form of the hallucination depending on\nthe mental processes of the percipient, who alone may supply the\nembodiment of the idea. But in certain cases, such as those above\nreferred to, the hallucination includes features which could not be\nsupplied by the percipient's mind, and seem in some way to be derived\nfrom the agent's ; it seems {see Phantasms of the Living,Vo\\. I., p. 555)\n\"that a ready-made concrete image, and not a mere idea, has been\ntransferred from one to the other.\" There is another peculiar feature\nin the case now before us ; viz., that there seems to be no reason\nwhy the apparition should have been seen at all by this particular\nperson. A few instances of the same kind are recorded in Phantasms\nof the Living (see Vol. I., p. 524, and Vol. II., p. 61) and another will\nbe found later in this chapter (No. 402. 8., p. 284). It is difficult to\ndecide, in the present state of our knowledge, as to the right explana\ntion of such cases ; but it may be suggested that they are quasi-\ncollective in character,1 the telepathic impulse reaching the percipient\nthrough the other person present\u2014the child in this case,\u2014who may\nhave acted as a link between agent and percipient, because the minds\nof both were much occupied with her.\nIn the second case of an unrecognised coincidental phantasm, the\nnon-recognition is of a different type, the figure seen appearing\nindistinct.\n(459. 2.) From Dr. W. A. Jamieson.\n35, Charlotte-square, Edinburgh, June 19th, 1891.\n\" I am an early riser ; the awakening bell rings usually at seven o'clock\na.m. On the morning of December 24th, 1887, it rang a little later, about\ntwenty minutes past seven.

He felt no ' chill ' or\nshudder, nor nervous feeling of any kind. He put out his hands to feel it,\nin order to find out what it was, having no definite idea what it would turn\nout to be. When he put out his hands the form had passed out of the light\nof the window, moving by his bedside, so that he did not see it disappear,\nbut only felt that there was nothing there.\n\" He first looked at his watch, ascertained the time to be 7.30, then woke\nhis wife and told her what he had seen ; but the resemblance of the form to\nhis patient did not occur to him at the time, so that he did not mention it\nto his wife : it only occurred to him after the news of her death had reached\nhim. He immediately went to see the husband, who told him that she\nhad died ' as near as 1 can say ' at 7.30.\n\"Though he knew the woman to be dying, his mind was not occupied\nabout her. When he went away after seeing her he dismissed her from\nhis mind.\n\" It could not possibly be a real human being, nor a reflection from\nanything.\"\nDr. Jamieson writes later :\u2014\n35, Charlotte-square, Edinburgh, October 2nd, 1891.\n\" Deak Sir,\u2014I now have much pleasure in sending the statements you\nwished me to obtain in connection with the experience I had on December\n24th, 1887.

I\nhave inquired at the Registrar's office and find that the husband of the\nlady registered the death as having occurred at 7.56 a.m. on December 24th,\n1887. This is certainly twenty-five minutes later than the time at which I\nsaw the dark appearance enter my room.

I was asleep and had\nnot risen from my bed when he woke me to tell me the following :\u2014\n\"That he had seen a dark figure come from the door on the side of\nthe room furthest from him. It walked round the foot of the bed and\ncame and stood at his side ; he put out his hand to feel, but encountered\nno one.

Jamieson.\"\n(2) From Mrs. 's daughter.\nOctober 2,\\d, 1891.\n\"Dear Dk. Jamieson, \u2014I just got your note last night on my return to\ntown. As far as I can remember it was just about eight o'clock or a few\nmmutes after that my mother died, December, 1887.\"\nThe non-recognition in this case appeared at the time to be due to\nthe bad light, which prevented the apparition from being seen dis\ntinctly : but an effect of this kind may be put down to the influence of\nself-suggestion. The case is analogous to those where an apparition\nbecomes invisible as soon as a light is put out and reappears on the\nrelighting of it (see, for instance, No. 422. 25, p. 192). It would\nseem that the telepathic impulse was prevented from reaching the\nconsciousness of the percipient in the form of a completely developed\nhallucination by his subconscious idea of the difficulty of seeing it. It\nis, however, quite possible to suppose that the telepathic impression\nwas altogether vague, so that there was no definite idea to be translated\ninto a hallucination. As Mr. Gurney expresses it (Phantasms of the\nLiving, Vol. I., p. 538, footnote), such an undistinctive idea may be\n* harried on into hallucination, without having first declared itself\nas an idea ; it assumes the definiteness of visible shape, while yet\nits content or message remains indefinite.\" The case would thus be\nanalogous to the cloud-like stages of some hallucinations, telepathic\nand other (see Chapter VI., p. 116), and to the shrouded forms\nclassed with undeveloped hallucinations (see Chapter VI., p. 119).\nIn the next case, we have an unrecognised apparition which has a\ncertain interest on account of its exceptionally rudimentary character.\nIt is just one step beyond the \" sense of presence,\" before mentioned,\nwhich we have regarded as not amounting to a sensory hallucination.\n\f268 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\n(554. 13.) From Miss Egerton.\nWhitwell Hall, York, April 10th, 1891.\n\"[At] Seville, April, 1882, I was leaving my bedroom hurriedly (pro\nbably to join my companions) when, as I opened my door, somebody\nappeared to enter, and I started hastily back; the impression disappeared\ninstantaneously ; there was no one. [I was] in good health, and in no\ngrief; [age] 36.\n\"The impression was absolutely vague, as to the individuality of the\nappearance. No one [else was present]. A week after the occurrence I\nheard of the death of a favourite cousin, which happened in Java, on the\nsame day.\n\"Mary L. Egerton.\"\nIn answer to inquiries, Miss Egerton writes further :\u2014\n\" I did not mention it to anyone at the time. I saw the figure vaguely,\nmore as an obstructive object or body, as I opened the door of my bedroom\nto go into a somewhat dark passage. The impression was sufficiently strong\nto make me start hurriedly back for fear of running ' amuck ' into the\nstranger, as I thought it was. The impression was gone instantaneously,\nand I saw there was no one. The moment I heard of my cousin's death,\nI remembered the impression, and made out then that it must have been\nwithin a few hours of his death.\"\nProfessor Sidgwick called on Miss Egerton in March, 1892, and writes\nfrom notes taken at the time:\u2014\nMarch 22nd, 1892.\n\" Miss Egerton said that when she opened her door to go out into the\npassage she had momentarily no doubt that she met, face to face, another\nhuman being coming in. Her impression was that it was a man, but the\nwhole thing was so startling and transient that she could not be sure\nof this. She started back just as she would do to avoid a sudden collision\nwith a real person. It seemed to be within a few inches of her.\n\" The passage was perfectly bare; with nothing in it to produce illusion.\nIt was lighted from a courtyard. (The event occurred in the Hotel de\nParis, at Seville.) When it was over, and she found there was no person\nthere, she regarded it as a momentary hallucination.\n\" When the news of the cousin's death in Java came, she convinced\nherself that the coincidence in time between her experience and the death\nwas ivithin an hour, allowing for difference of longitude. (The exact hour\nof the cousin's death was communicated.) The relation between the two\nwas more intimate than ordinary cousinship, as they had been much with\neach other from childhood; he was more like a younger brother.\n\" The hallucination was only of the sense of sight. It was a quite\nunique experience.\"\nIn cases such as this and Dr. Jamieson's, the closeness of the\ncoincidence and the uniqueness of the experience are specially impor\ntant considerations in estimating the probability that the hallucination\nand the death were causally connected.\n\fxiv.] Unrecognised coincident Voices. 269\nOut of 17 cases of hallucinatory lights in our Census, 7, as already\nsaid (p. 125), were seen at or about the time of a death ; two of these,\nNo. 191.2 (see p. 124), and No. 305. 4 (see p. 126), have been given\nalready, but as evidence of a telepathic connection between death and\nhallucination we cannot lay much stress on them, since they are open\nto another interpretation. This, for various reasons, is true also, we\nthink, of the remaining cases, which we do not therefore quote here.\nOf unrecognised auditory hallucinations coinciding with a death,\nwe have 8 cases. The following is one of them :\u2014\n(561. 24.) From Mrs. E. L. Kearney.\n2, Wharton-road, West Kensington, W., November 30tk, 1891.\n\"I felt my bed shaken under me, and heard a gurgling noise, and a\ndistinct cry for help. Time and date, about 1 p.m., New Year's Day, 1875.\nPlace, Westbourne, Hermitage-road, Geelong, Victoria, Australia.\n\" I was fully awake, lying in bed convalescent from an attack of scarlet\nrash. During this illness the rash only remained a few hours, and I had no\nsymptoms of fever, neither thirst, nor high temperature, nor derangement\nof consciousness. I was not in any grief or anxiety.

I should like to add that two days previous to my\ncousin Charlie Griffith's going up the country he came to say good-bye to\nmyself and my family, but as his people were afraid I might have something\ninfectious, he remained at the garden gate, and called out to my mother,\nwho was standing on the balcony, to say good-bye to me, as he could not\ncome in. Two days later he was drowned.\"\nMrs. Kearney enclosed the following note from her father. Her mother,\nbeing ill, could not be pressed to write any statement of her recollections.\n\" With regard to the Charley Griffith episode, neither your mother nor I\ncan call to mind any exact particulars. I do remember your returning about\nChristmas time from a visit to the Timms', and having what was supposed\nmight be an attack of scarlet fever. I remember the news coming in the\n\f270 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nafternoon of 1st January (year I know not)\u2014the news of the poor boy's being\ndrowned in a pool at Edmondson's station. Your mother remembers your\ncalling her into your bedroom to tell her you had heard ' a cry,' or some\nthing of that sort ; no more.\"\nMrs. Kearney has had another experience mentioned in Chapter VIII.,\np. 156.\nBoth Mr. and Mrs. Kearney are known to Mr. Myers.\nThough the hallucination in this case was unrecognised and did not\nindicate the person who was dying, it gave some indication of the\nnature of the death, and the evidence, therefore, for a telepathic origin\nis something more than the mere coincidence of the two events in time.\nAn unrecognised auditory death-coincidence, in which the hallu\ncination consisted merely in the hearing of the name of one of the\npercipients, will be found in Chapter XV., p. 316 (No. 138. 18).\nThe hallucinations in the present collection affecting the sense of\ntouch only, which are believed to have coincided with the death of a\nfriend or relative, need not detain us. There are seven of these, besides\nthe one quoted at p. 258.\nHallucinations Experimentally Produced.\n\"We turn now to cases where some event other than the death of\nthe supposed agent coincides with the hallucination in such a way as\nto suggest a causal connection between them.\nThe special importance of one class among these, viz., hallucinations\nexperimentally caused, (B experiencing a hallucination when A is,\nunknown to B, endeavouring by mental suggestion to induce one in\nhim), was dwelt on in Chapter I. This class is not very strongly\nrepresented in the present collection, probably because the experiment\nis only rarely attempted. We have four cases which belong to it more\nor less, two of them visual, one auditory, and one tactile.\nIt is to be observed that the agent in the first of these cases\u2014\nMr. Kirk\u2014seems to possess an unusual capacty for impressing other\nminds telepathically, as shown by his experiments in thought-trans\nference, a few of which have been already printed in the Journal, and\nsome more of which we hope to publish in a future Part of the\nProceedings.\n(The following case is not included in our Tables, because it occurred\nafter the percipient\u2014Miss G.\u2014had filled up the Census form).\n(284. 19.) From Mr. Kirk.\n2, Ripon-villas, Upper Ripon-road, Plunwtead, Jrdy 7th, 1890.\n\" I have to inform you that from the 10th to 20th June I tried a telepathic\nexperiment each night upon Miss G. I did so, as suggested by you in your\nletter of June 3rd, without her knowledge, as a preliminary to entering upon\n\fXIV.] 271\nExperimental Hallucinations.\nexperiments with her under conditions of expectancy and the recording of\ndates and hours. Each trial had for its object the rendering myself visible\nto her\u2014simply visible. With the exception of one\u2014which was made one\nafternoon from my office in the Arsenal\u2014each trial took place at my house\nbetween the hours of 11 p.m. and 1 a.m.\n\" L'p to June 23rd I heard nothing direct from my 'subject.' Indirectly,\nhowever, I learnt that my influence was acting rather strongly. Each time\nMiss G. came to my house, while the experiments were in progress, she\ncomplained of being kept sleepless and restless from an uneasy feeling which\nshe was unable to describe or account for. On one night, so strong was this\naneasy feeling, she was compelled to get up, dress herself, and tike to some\nneedlework, and was unable to throw off the sensation and return to bed\nuntil 2 o'clock. I made no comments on these complaints\u2014never dropped a\nbint, even, as to what I was doing. Under these circumstances it seemed\nprobable to me that, although my influence was telling upon her, to her dis\ncomfort, I had not succeeded in the object of my experiments. Supposing\nthis to be the case, and that I was only depriving her of rest, I thought it\nbest to discontinue the trials for a time.\n\" I felt disappointed at this apparently barren result. But, on June 23rd,\nan agreeable surprise was sprung upon me, in that I learnt I had most\neffectually succeeded on one occasion\u2014the very occasion on which I had\nconsidered success as being highly improbable\u2014in presenting myself to Miss\n6. As you will find in her statement, herewith enclosed, the vision was\nmost complete and realistic. The trial which had this fortunate result was\nthat I had made from my office and on the spur of the moment. I had been\nrather closely engaged on some auditing work, which had tired me, and as\nnear as I can remember the time was between 3.30 and 4 p.m., that I laid\ndown my pencil, stretched myself, and in the act of doing the latter I was\nseized with the impulse to make a trial on Miss G. I did not, of course,\nknow where she was at the moment, but, with a flash, as it were, I transferred\nmyself to her bedroom. I cannot say why I thought of that spot, unless it\nwas that I did so because my first experiment had been made there. 1 As it\nhappened, it was what I must call a 'lucky shot,' for I caught her at the\nmoment she was lightly sleeping in her chair\u2014a condition which seems to\nbe peculiarly favourable to receiving and externalising telepathic messages.\n\"The figure seen by Miss G. was clothed in a suit I was at the moment\nwearing, and was bareheaded, the latter as would be the case, of course, in an\noffice. This suit is of a dark reddish-brown cluck stuff, and it was an unusual\ncircumstance for me to have had on the ctxit at the time, as I wear, as a rule,\nan office coat of light material. But this office coat I had, a day or so before,\nsent to a tailor to be repaired, and I had, therefore, to keep on that belong\ning to the dark suit.\n1 The first experiment of this series was on the night of the 10th, the successful\nexperiment on the afternoon of June 11th (Wednesday). Mr. Kirk tells us that he\nmade a note at the time on his blotting paper, of day and hour. Mr. Kirk had on\nfour occasions during the previous four years tried from a distance to produce an\nimpression of presence on Miss G. with considerable success, but had not tried to\nappear to her. These experiments and others are described in the Journal S.P. R.,\nVol V., pp. 21\u201430.\n\f272 Report on the Cenms of Hallucinations. [chap.\n\" I tested the reality of the vision by this dark suit. I asked, ' How was\nI dressed ? ' (not at all a leading question). The reply of Miss 6. was,\ntouching the sleeve of the coat I was then wearing (of a light suit), ' Not\nthis coat, but that dark suit you wear sometimes. I even saw clearly the\nsmall check pattern of it ; and I saw your features as plainly as though you\nhad been bodily present. I cotdd not have seen you more distinctly.' \"\nMiss G.'s account is :\u2014\nJune 280i, 1890.\n\" A peculiar occurrence happened to me on the Wednesday of the week\nbefore last. In the afternoon (being tired by a morning walk), while sitting\nin an easy-chair near the window of my own room, I fell asleep. At any\ntime I happen to sleep during the day (which is but seldom) I invariably\nawake with tired uncomfortable sensations, which take some little time to\npass off ; but that afternoon, on the contrary, I was suddenly quite wide\nawake, seeing Mr. Kirk standing near my chair, dressed in a dark brown\ncoat, which I had frequently seen him wear. His back was towards the\nwindow, his right hand towards me ; he passed across the room towards the\ndoor, which is opposite the window, the space between being 15ft., the fur\nniture so arranged as to leave just that centre clear ; but when he got about\n4ft. from the door, which was closed, he disappeared.\n\"My first thought was, 'had this happened a few hours later I should\nhave believed it telepathic,' for I knew Mr. Kirk had tried experimenting\nat different times, but had no idea he was doing so recently. Although I\nhave been much interested by his conversation about psychical phenomena\nat various times during the past year, I must confess the element of doubt\nwould very forcibly present itself as to whether telepathic communication\ncould be really a fact ; and I then thought, knowing he must be at the office\nat the time I saw him (which was quite as distinctly as if he had been really\nin the room), that in this instance, at least, it must be purely imaginary, and\nfeeling so sure it was only fancy, resolved not to mention it, and did not do\nso until this week, when, almost involuntarily, I told him all about it. Much\nto my astonishment, Mr. K irk was very pleased with the account, and asked\nme to write it, telling me that on that afternoon, feeling rather tired, he put\ndown his pen for a few moments, and, to use his own words, ' threw himself\ninto this room.' He also told me he had purposely avoided this subject in\nmy presence lately, that he might not influence me, but was anxiously hoping\nI would introduce it.\n\" I feel sure I had not been dreaming of him, and cannot remember that\nanything had happened to cause me even to think of him that afternoon\nbefore falling asleep.\"\nMr. Kirk writes later :\u2014\n\"I have only succeeded once in making myself visible to MissG. since the\noccasion I have already reported, and that had the singularity of being only\nmy features\u2014my face in miniature, that is, about three inches in diameter.\"\nIn a letter dated January 19th, 1891, Mr. Kirk says as to this last\nappearance :\u2014\n\" Miss G. did not record this at the time, as she attached no importance to\nit, but I noted the date (July 23rd) on my office blotting-pad, as it was at\nthe office I was thinking of her. I say 'thinking,' because I was doing so\n\fxiv.] Experimental Hallucinatiims. 273\nin connection with another subject, and with no purpose of making an ex\nperiment. I had a headache, and was resting my head on my left hand.\nSuddenly it occurred to me that my thinking about her might probably\ninfluence her in some way, and I made the note I have mentioned.\"1\nMrs. Sidgwick had a talk with Mr. Kirk and with Miss G. on April\n8th, 1892, about the above incidents and other experiments in thought-\ntransference between them, and writes :\u2014\n\" Mr. Kirk's appearance to Miss G. evidently impressed her very much. It\nwas extremely realistic. She is quite sure she was awake. It was as if she\nhad waked up to see it, but she had not been dreaming of Mr. Kirk. The\nfigure did not look towards her or appear to take any interest in her. The\nother time she saw his face it was like a miniature. She did not think so\nmuch of that experience.\"\nThe experiment in the following case succeeded on the first trial.\n(98. 13.) From Miss Edith Maughan (now Mrs. G. Rayleigh Vicars).\nSeptemlxr, 1890.\n\"One night in September, 1888, I was lying awake in bed reading. I for-\n.get what the book was, but I had recently been studying with interest\nrarious cases of astral projection in Phantasms of the Living, and I distinctly\nremember making up my mind that night to try whether I could manage to\naccomplish a projection of myself by force of will-concentration.\n\"The room next to mine was occupied by a friend of mine [Miss Ethel\nThompson], who was an old acquaintance, and not at all of an excitable turn\nof mind. This room had formerly been used as a dressing-room, and there\nwas a door connecting it with mine. For some years, however, it had been\nabsolutely separated by the locked door, on my side of which stood a very\nheavy wardrobe, which would require two strong men to move it away. The\nonly available exit from my room was the other door which opened on to\nthe landing, as was also the case with the dressing-room. That night I per\nfectly recall lying back on my pillow with a resolute but half doubtful and\namused determination to make Miss Thompson see me. The candle was\nburning on a chair at the side of my bed, and I heard only the ticking of the\nclock in my room as I ' willed ' with all my might to appear to her. After\na few minutes I felt dizzy and only half conscious.\n\"I don't know how long this state may have lasted, but I do remember\nemerging into a conscious state and thinking I had better leave off, as the\nstrain had exhausted me.\n\" I gave up, and changing into an easy position I thought I had failed\nand needlessly fatigued myself for an impossible fancy. I blew out my\ncandle ; at the instant I was startled by hearing an indistinct sound from\nthe next room. It was Miss Thompson's voice raised slightly, but I could\nnot distinguish more than the actual sound, which was repeated, and then\nthere was silence. I wondered whether she had had a bad dream, and\nlistened a short time, but did not seriously imagine that it was more than an\naccidental coincidence. Soon after my clock struck 2 (a.m.) and I fell asleep.\n1 Mr. Kirk enclosed the piece of blotting-palier with the note.\nT\n\f274 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\n\" Next morning I noticed that Miss Thompson looked rather tired at\nbreakfast, but I asked no questions. Presently she said, ' Had I gone into\nher room to frighten her during the night ? ' I said I had not left my room.\nShe declared that I seemed to her to come in and bend over her. From\nwhat she said I concluded it must have been between 1 and 2 a.m. Her\nown account is in the possession of the Psychical Society. All I have to\nadd is, that I was in my ordinary state of health, and not at all excited, but\nmerely bent on trying an experiment.\"\nIn a letter accompanying this, Miss Maughan says :\u2014\n\" I can't find the fact noticed in my diary for 1888. I only keep a very\ntiny one, just for the sake of entering letters, &c., and have no allusions to\nwhat happens as a rule. I fancy, though, that it was on the night of\nSeptember 10th. Does Miss Thompson give any exact date ? for if it\napproximates to that, it would be the correct one-. I know it was just at\nthat time, because it was during her last visit at this house. \"\nMiss Thompson writes :\u2014\nThe Chimes, Grove Park, Chiswick, December 30f\/i, 1889.\n\" During the summer of 1888 (end of August) I was staying with the Miss\nMaughans in Lincolnshire. We were interested in Theosophy, and had\nbeen discussing the phenomena of people leaving their bodies and appearing\nin their astral forms. I am not a good sleeper, but not at all of a nervous\ntemperament. I stayed awake one night until two or three. I was per\nfectly wide awake, when suddenly I saw Miss Edith Maughan standing by\nmy bedside in her ordinary dark dressing-gown. The moonlight came in at\nthe window sufficiently for me to distinguish her face clearly, and her figure\npartially. I sat up in bed, and said, rather crossly, ' What do you want\nhere, Edith ? ' I thought she had come for some joke. As she didn't\nanswer, I immediately struck a light, but she was gone. It is a mistake that I\nscreamed out. I may have spoken sufficiently loudly to be heard in the next\nroom. I thought she had got out of the room with astonishing rapidity,\nbut I didn't trouble much about it. The next morning I asked why she\ncame into my room. She denied having done so, but said she had thought\nof coming, but that as it might disturb me she decided not. She said she sat\nup in bed, and for the sake of something to do was willing herself to go out\nof her body and come to me, and mentioned about the time I saw her.\nAlthough it is more than a year ago, I remember the incident clearly, as it\nmade a distinct impression upon me.\n\"Ethel Thompson.\"\nMrs. Sidgwick has talked over this experience with Miss Maughan and\nMiss Thompson separately, and questioned them specially as to the possi\nbility that Miss Maughan had really gone into Miss Thompson's room\nunconsciously. They were both quite certain that she had not done so,\nMiss Thompson dwelling on the impossible rapidity of the disappearance,\nand Miss Maughan on the fact that, when she roused herself, she was lying\nin the same position as before\u2014hands clasped and feet crossed in a special\nmanner, which, she had been told, is adopted by Eastern people wishing to\nconcentrate themselves on anything, and which she adopted deliberat\u00abl)- on\nthis account.\n\fXIV.] 275\nExperimental Hallucinations.\nIt is interesting that Miss Maughan has appeared, but unintention\nally, on other occasions to other percipients, while one of her sisters\nwas the agent in No. 105. 1 (see p. 291). The following is an account\nof another of Miss Maughan's appearances.\n[Extract from letter received by Miss Maughan on March 12th from Miss\nGatty. The original letter is in our possession.]\nHolbein House, Sloane-square, S.W., Wednesday, March 11th, 1891.\n\" I wonder whether you have been experimenting psychically, or if it bo\na mere curious coincidence that I should have had a distinct vision of you\nlast night.\n\"The facts are these. Being very seedy yesterday\u2014writing to you\nprobably tired me a good deal, and feeling very helpless where you were\nconcerned distressed me more than a little\u2014I went off to [bed] at about\n8 o'clock. I read for an hour or thereabouts, and then fell asleep. I woke\nagain when mother passed through to go to her own room, and several times\nin the night after dreaming in an unexciting fashion. Then I lay awake for\nsome time, and thought about a Roman Catholic I know, etc.\n\"A little while after, I don't know what it was that made me turn my\nhead towards one special corner of the room, where I saw you standing (in a\nnightdress trimmed with Swiss embroidery), in a most ill-balanced posture.\nSo much did this strike me that I got out of bed (the cold of the floor was\nexcessive), and went to catch you, so that you might not fall over on your\nface. You remained there until I had made the motion of touching, when I\nfound nothing there any longer. This is all, except that you looked as if\nyou had candlelight or some faintly perceptible yellowishness behind you.\nI went back to bed, and, not liking to disturb mother by asking her the\ntime, I listened for the chimes, and shortly after heard four strike. Of\ncourse I didn't go to sleep again, but lighted my candle and read until day\ndawned. At breakfast I told mother, who accounts for everything by the\nword 'somnambulism,' but says she heard me moving about. I am perfectly-\nconvinced of my wakefulness, but in any case, as I am unused to sleep\nwalking, that would be strange enough in itself to make me wonder if there\nshould be any cause for it beyond my subjective reason of anxiety about\nyou. The time is the most curious part, is it not ? \" E. K. G.\"\nMiss Maughan writes :\u2014\nEast Kirkby Vicarage, Spilsby, Lincolnshire, May 21st, 1891.\n\" I left W , in Derbyshire, on March 10th, and arrived at Collingham,\nin Nottinghamshire, about 3 p.m. I was not alone, or able in any way to\ngive my attention to any one subject until nearly midnight, when I went to\nbed. During the whole evening, though I had been busy hearing and giving\nnews of mutual interest, I had experienced a sort of ' undertone ' of thought\nabout my friend E. G. [Miss Gatty]. I had only once spoken of her inci\ndentally during the evening, but I felt my mind revert to her in a general\nway for a few moments several times. When I got to bed I lay awake and\nthought of her again. Why, I did not really know. I had heard from her\nthe day before, saying she was not well, but that was not specially in my\nT 2\n\f276 [chap.\nReport on the Census of Hallucinations.\nmind, as I did not suppose she was more than temporarily indisposed. I\nremember wondering at the time why she was so present to my mind, as I\nhad a great many things to think of that day totally apart from any connec\ntion with her.\n\"I fell asleep at last, to wake up suddenly. It must have been after\n3 a.m., as the fire had burnt very low\u2014almost out.\n' ' During the short time I lay awake I remember clearly that the thought\nof E. G. returned strongly to my mind. I felt an instinctive turning\ntowards her for the mental sympathy certain circumstances might render me\nin need of, and I felt with a sort of flash that she would be better able to\nunderstand what T wanted than any friend I had. I know I dwelt on this\nwith strengthening confidence until I fell asleep.\n\" I had not been dreaming consciously of anything : I merely woke up,\nthought of E. G., and mentally claimed her sympathy, but with no intention\nwhatever of trying to influence her in any possible way. The whole attitude\nof my mind was unconscious and involuntary, and, but for the letter 1\nreceived from her on the 12th, I should have attached no importance to the\nmatter. \"Edith Maugham.\"\nOn another occasion, in 1886 or 1887, Miss Maughan was staying in the\nhouse of Mr. T. [assumed initial], and Mrs. T. one evening thought she saw\nher for a moment standing in the doorway when she was really in another\nroom. Mr. and Mrs. T. together also saw her later on the same day going\ndownstairs into a room. They followed, and found the room empty, Miss\nMaughan having gone to bed.\nMiss Maughan herself says of this case :\u2014\n\"The being seen by Mr. T. is not so positive to my mind. I was very\nill at the time, and any mistaken impression must rest upon his shoulders.\nI have argued the possibility of my being seen in reality, but he and his\nwife appear convinced. I can't be sure about it myself.\"\nMrs. Sidgwick writes :\u2014\nJune 26th, 1891.\n\" I saw Miss Edith Maughan, and also Mrs. T., with whom she is staying,\nthis afternoon. In the case where Mr. and Mrs. T. were the percipients, Miss\nMaughan was simply sitting in the drawing-room, wishing that Mr. T. would\nconsent to her going home, because she felt so ill. Mr. and Mrs. T. were in\nthe passage talking. Mr. T. said he had forgotten to say good-night to\nMiss Maughan. Mrs. T. said, ' I think she has gone upstairs. ' He replied,\n'No, I saw her go into the study.' Mrs. T. said, 'Oh, I think I did too' ;\nand they went to look, and she was not there. I did not gather that the\nfigure was very clearly seen in this case. It was more distinct on the other\noccasion, which occurred on the same afternoon, when Mrs. T. saw Miss\nMaughan looking over the shoulder of a man to whom she (Mrs. T.) was\ntalking in the dining-room.\n\" As to the appearance to Miss Gatty, Miss Maughan is quite sure that\nshe did think of her in a special way, as the person who would be able to\nhelp her in an anticipated difficulty. This suddenly occurred to her in the\nmiddle of the night. It appears that Miss Gatty was troubled about Miss\nMaughan, wishing she could help her in her difficulty. Miss Maughan told\n\fExperimental Hallucinations. 277\nme that she had written to Miss Gatty about this difficulty, and begged her\nto write to her often while it lasted. Miss Maughan is not sure whether\nthe embroidery seen on the apparition by Miss Gatty was of the kind that\nshe was wearing then.\"\nThe tactile experience referred to on p. 270 occurred in an experi\nment which\u2014as the percipient, Miss C. M. Campbell, says\u2014 cannot be\ncalled a success. Her friend, Miss Despard, had agreed to try to appear\nto her, without fixing the days beforehand ; and it is remarkable that\na sense of presence, and in one case a soft touch as if some one were\nstroking her hair, were felt by Miss Campbell on the only two nights\non which Miss Despard made the attempt ; but that was all that\noccurred. The letters and notes relating to the experiments have been\nsubmitted to us.\nA seemingly telepathic visual experience of Miss Campbell's has been\nprinted in Chapter IV., p. 85. (See also Proceedings S. P. R. , Vol. VIII, pp.\n314 and 324). She has also carried out some other successful experiments\nin thought-transference with Miss Despard, an account of which was printed\nin the Jounud S. P. R., January, 1893.\nThe experiment in which the auditory hallucination occurred was\nof an entirely different kind. It is as follows :\u2014\n(78. 14.) From Mrs. Raines.\n(The account was written in 1889.)\n46, Sussex-gardens, Hyde Park, VV.\n\"At 20 minutes to 11 on the night when Mr. Irving Bishop took up\nMr. Labouchere's challenge to read the number of a note enclosed in an\nenvelope, I heard my husband's voice say, quite loud and distinctly, ' He\nhas read the number of the note.' It was so distinct that for a moment\nI could not believe he was not in the room. My next thought was to\nascertain the exact time. I was in our own dining-room.\n\" I was working, and expecting my husband's return, he having gone to\nthe seance. I had asked him to try and will me to know if the note was\nread, and he said the trial would take place from about 9.30 to 10 o'clock.\nSo at that hour I fixed my mind intently on the subject, but as there was no\nresult I gave up trying, and was not thinking of the note when I heard\nthe voice. When he did return his first words were, ' Well, he read the\nnumber of the note, and it was exactly 20 minutes to 11 when he read it.'\nHe afterwards told me he was one of the committee chosen to sit on the\nplatform, and see fair play.\n\" It was my husband's voice, and I believed him to be on his way home\nat the time I heard it.\n\"I was quite alone.\n\" I did not make any notes, as the experiment was only attempted out of\ncuriosity, and the intimation reaching me so much later-than I expected,\nmade me believe at the time that it had failed.\n\" Kate Raines.\"\n\f278 Report on the Census of Hallucinations.

I quite remember coming home at\nabout a quarter to 12, and on my entering the dining-room she at once said,\n'Mr. Bishop has read the note,' and narrated how she had heard my voice\ntelling her that Mr. B. had done so.\n\"Julius Raines.\"\nMr. Podmore writes:\u2014\nNovember 25th, 1891.\n\" I called on General and Mrs. Raines to-day. They could add nothing\nfurther to the story; except that Mrs. Raines told me that, in the Irving\nBishop case, she went out into the hall, after hearing the voice, in order to\nnote the time by the clock there. The voice sounded quite real and lifelike.\nThe incident occurred about 6 or 7 years ago, they think. Mrs. Raines\nadded accounts of two prophetic dreams, fulfilled ; both of which account*\nGeneral Raines, to whom the dreams were told before fulfilment, cor\nroborated.\"\nThe arrangement made beforehand in this case may have had some\ninfluence in inducing the hallucination, which, it will \\ie observed,\nhowever, conveyed the correct one of the two possible alternatives,\nand gave this information at the right time, and after the percipient\nhad given up expecting it.\nHallucinations Coinciding ivith Illness and Accidents.\nIn the next set of cases to be considered, the hallucination occurs\nduring a sudden or serious illness of the supposed agent, which was\nunknown to the percipient.

D.\nBryce Douglas, of Seafield Tower, Ardrossan. He was managing director of\nthe 'Naval Construction and Armaments Company,' and had resided at Furness\nAbbey Hotel for some eighteen months or more. He had invited us, along\nwith a number of other friends, to the launch of the Empress of Chhut. We\nbreakfasted with Mr. Bryce Douglas on the day of the launch, the 25th, and\nafterwards saw the launch, had luncheon at the shipyard, and returned to the\nhotel. He appeared to be in his usual health and spirits (he was a power\nfully-built man, and justly proud of his fine constitution). The following\nday (Thursday) he left with a party of gentlemen, to sail from Liverpool to\nArdrossan, on the trial trip of the Empress of Japan (another large steamer\nwhich had been built at his yard).\n\" We remained on at the hotel for some days with our son Bob, aged 23,\nwho was staying there, superintending work which Mr. McAlpine was carry\ning on at Barrow.\n\"On the Monday night, the 30th, I went upstairs after dinner. On my\nway down again I saw Mr. Bryce Douglas, standing in the doorway of his sit\nting-room. I saw him quite distinctly. He looked at me with a sad expres\nsion. He was wearing a cap which I had never seen him wear. I walked on and\nleft him standing there. It was then about ten minutes to eight. I told my\nhusband and Bob. We all felt alarmed, and we immediately sent the follow\ning telegram, ' How is Mr. Bryce Douglas I ' to Miss Caldwell, his sister-in-\nlaw, who kept house for him at Seafield. It was too late for a reply that\nnight. On Tuesday morning we received a wire from her ; it ran thus :\n'Mr. Bryce Douglas dangerously ill.' That telegram was the first intimation\nof his illness which reached Barrow. As will be seen in the account of his\nillness and death in the Barrow News, he died on the following Sunday,\nand we afterwards ascertained from Miss Caldwell that he was unconsciims\non Monday evening, at the time I saw him.\n\"My husband and [step] son can corroborate this, and I have also letters\nwhich bear out my statements.\"\nIn her earlier account Mrs. McAlpine states that she \" was in good\nhealth, and in no grief or anxiety whatever.\" Her age was 26.\nMrs. McAlpine enclosed a copy of the Barrow News for April 11th, 1891,\ncontaining a memoir of Mr. Bryce Douglas, and a full account of his last\nillness and death. It appears from this account that he left Barrow on\nThursday, March 26th, to join the steamer Empress of Japan. He was\nnoticed by his friends to be far from well on Wednesday, the previous day,\non the occasion of the launch of the Empress of China, and was advised to\ngo home.

He died on April 5th, at about 5 a.m.\nFrom the evidence which follows it seems clear that if any anxiety as to\nhis health was felt before he left Barrow, as suggested in the newspaper\nreport, Mrs. McAlpine knew nothing of it.\nMr. Myers writes :\u2014\n\" I discussed the incident connected with the death of Mr. Bryce\nDouglas with Mr. and Mrs. McAlpine and Mr. McAlpine, jun., on February\n24th, 1892.

Mr. Bryce Douglas\nwas a robust and vigorous man, and disliked ever to be supposed to be ill.\nMr. McAlpine therefore felt great unwillingness to telegraph to him about\nhis health, but from his previous knowledge of phenomena occurring to Mrs.\nMcAlpine, he felt sure that her vision must be in some sense veridical.\"\nMrs. McAlpine's husband and his son corroborate as follows :\u2014\nApril, 1892.\n\" I was at Barrow on the 25th of March of last year (1891), and\ndistinctly remember the incident of the following Monday night.

From Miss Caldwell, sister-in-law of Mr. Bryce-Douglas :\u2014\n[Post mark, February 8th, 18!*2.]\n\"... I can remember perfectly well the [telegram] you sent on\nMonday, the ,'JOth of March, the day after [Mr. Bryce Douglas] arrived\n\fXIV.J 281\nApparitions Coinciding with Illness.\nhome, and I was very much surprised at receiving it, as I did not think any\none knew he was so ill ; but I remembered afterwards that you and Mr.\nMcAlpine were at the launch of the Empress of Ch ina, and Mr. Bryce Douglas\nwas rather complaining at that time, so I thought you would want to know\nif he was better. The contents of the telegram were\u2014as far as I can re\nmember\u2014' Kindly let us know if Mr. Bryce is better.' \"\n2. From Miss Charlton, daughter of Mr. Charlton, of Barrow-in-Furness.\n(Mr. and Mrs. McAlpine and their son had spent the Sunday, March 29th,\nat the house of Mr. Charlton, who was also a personal friend of Mr. Bryce\nDouglas).\nFebruary loth, 1892.\n\" . . . [My father] says I am to tell you that he can quite bear out\nall you have said\u2014indeed, we all can, for on the Sunday you were here, we\nwere all quite unconscious of the fact that Mr. Douglas was ill. Indeed, it\nwas not until the Tuesday after (Easter Tuesday) that father heard by tele\ngram\u2014his first intimation -which ran as follows:\u2014'I have been very ill,\n&c. We also did hear of what you saw at the hotel . . . and we\nthought it a very singular coincidence at the time.\"\nMrs. Scarlett, the wife of the proprietor of the Furness Abbey Hotel,\nalso confirms the sending of the telegram.\nOf the other two experiences communicated to us by Mrs. McAlpine, one\nis the following death-coincidence, which, however, we have not counted in\nChapter XII., because of her unenumerated experiences, all of which, as\nhas been said, she believes to have been telepathic.\nApril 30th, 1892.\n\"I remember my brother, who lived some six miles from us, writing a\npostcard to mamma, saying, ' Come up to see us to-day, the children have\ncolds,' or some such words, not indicating anything serious, or any particular\nchild. We were not alarmed, but mamma drove to see them about 1 o'clock\nin the day. At 6 o'clock I was crossing the hall and saw, as in a cloud, the\nbaby (aged about 6 months) lying dead. I looked at the clock and told a\nservant, who was the only other person in the house, that the child was\ndead. She was shocked, and asked if I had had a telegram. I told her what\nI had seen. Next morning I had a letter from mamma telling me that the\nbaby had died at 6 o'clock the previous evening. She remembers the occurr\nence, and can give the exact date, which I have forgotten.\"\nThe letter printed below, to Mrs. McAlpine from her mother, corrobo\nrates both the incidents already described :\u2014\nFebruary 8th, 1892.\n\" I remember perfectly that you wrote me from Barrow\u2014from the\nFurness Abbey Hotel\u2014saying you had had a bad shock, that you were\npassing along a corridor and you saw Mr. Bryce Douglas in his room, stand\ning and looking at you\u2014knowing that he had left early in the day (it was\nthen evening) you were alarmed and got your husband to wire an inquiry\nabout his friend\u2014that the reply was ' He is very ill.' You wrote that letter\nthe morning after the appearance.\n\" I also remember very clearly about your brother Ben's little child.\nYou and I only were at home here. I got a note asking me to go to his\n\f282 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nhouse, as the little ones had colds and their mother was anxious, but there\nwas nothing to cause you to expect bad news. I went, and the poor baby\nwas dying when I arrived, and at 6 o'clock was dead. At that exact time\nyou told the maid that the doctor's baby was dead. She knew the hour,\nshe told me long afterwards, because you told her to look at the clock. When\nI got home, in a few days, I asked you, ' Were you shocked when the\nmessenger came saying the poor little baby was dead ? ' You replied, ' Oh,\nno ; I knew at the time it died.' And either then or soon after you said,\n' I saw it.' \"\nWith regard to the exact date of the baby's death, Mrs. McAlpine wrote\nagain later to her mother, and received the following reply :\u2014\nOctober, 1893.\n\" [The baby] died on Saturday, April 6th, 1888. . . I have never\nforgotten the very strange circumstance of how you told me when I got\nhome that you saw the poor little child, the time being exactly when she\ndied. You did not know previously that she was seriously ill.\"\nFor another of Mrs. McAlpine's experiences, see p. 332.\nThe following has already been referred to as one of the rare cases\nin which a note of the phenomenon was not only taken at the time but\npreserved. Here, as will be seen, the apparition occurs within the last\n32 hours of a brief fatal illness of which the percipient had no know\nledge.\n(660. 6.) From Miss Hervey,\ni), Tavistock Crescent, W., April 28M, 1892.\n\"I saw the figure of my cousin (a nurse in Dublin) coming upstairs,\ndressed in grey. I was in Tasmania, and the time that I saw her was\nbetween 6 and 7 p.m. on April 21st, 1888.\n\"I had just come in from a ride and was in the best of health and\nspirits. I was between 31 and 32 years of age.\n\"I had lived with my cousin, and we were the greatest of friends, but my\ngoing to Tasmania in 1887 had, of course, separated us. She was a nurse,\nand at the time I saw her in April, 1888, she was dying of typhus fever, a\nfact unknown to me till 6 weeks after her death. Her illness lasted only 5\ndays, and I heard of her death at the same time as of her illness.\n\"There was no one present with me at the time, but I narrated what I\nhad seen to the friend with whom I was living, and asked why my cousin,\nEthel B. , should have been dressed in grey. My friend said that was the\ndress of the nurses in that particular hospital ; a fact unknown to me.\n\"The impression of seeing my cousin was so vivid that I wrote a long\nletter to her that night, saying I had had this vision. The letter, arriving\nafter she was dead, was returned to me and I destroyed it.\"\n\"Rose B. E. I. Hervey.\"\nMr. Podmore writes :\u2014-\nJuly 21st. 1892.\n\"I called on Miss Hervey to-day. She was staying at the time of her\nexperience with Lady H. Miss Hervey and Lady H. had just returned\n\fXIV.] Apparitions Coinciding with Illness.\nfrom a drive, and Miss Hervey was leaving her room to cross the upper\nlanding to Lady H.'s room to have tea. On passing the stairs she saw the\nfigure coming up. She recognised it at once and ran away to Lady H.,\nwithout waiting to see the figure disappear, and told her what she had seen.\nlady H. laughed at her, but told her to note it in her diary. This Miss\nHervey did. I saw the entry :\u2014 ' Saturday, April 21st, 1888, ti p.m. Vision\nof [nickname given] on landing in grey dress.' The news of death did not\narrive till June. Date of death, April 22nd, 1888, at 4.30 p.m.\"\nWe have seen a copy, retained by Miss Hervey, of a letter giving an\naccount of Miss Ethel B.'s death. It was written on the evening of Sunday,\nApril 22nd, 1888. The letter speaks of Miss B. having been \"so heavy with\nfever all through.\" The crisis of the illness began at 4 a.m. on the 22nd.\nAbout 10 she got a change decidedly for the worse, and lingered on till half\npast four, when she died. Miss B.'s relations were unable to be with her.\nThe difference of time between Tasmania and Dublin is about 10 hours,\nso that the apparition preceded the death by about thirty-two hours.\nWe have examined a pattern of the material used for the nurses' dress\nat the hospital where Miss B. was. It is of cotton, with a sort of check\npattern of white and dark navy blue and a little red : it has a greyish tone\nat a little distance, but the coincidence in respect of colour is not marked\nenough to be of any value.\nWe wrote to Lady H. asking for her recollections of the matter, and\nreceived the following reply.\nMy 30th, 1893.\n\"Dear Sir,\u2014Your letter dated April 6th has followed me back to Eng\nland, and I should have answered it a week or two sooner, but I thought my\nson from Tasmania might be able to throw some light on your search for a\ndefinite corroboration of Miss Hervey's account of an apparition which she\ntells you she saw when in Tasmania with us in 1888. He, however, can do\nlittle more than I can for its confinuation. He recollects that Miss Hervey\nmade such a statement at the time, and I seem to remember something\nabout it, but nothing really definite.\"\ni\nMiss Hervey has had one other apparently veridical vision. As a girl of\n14 at school, she saw an angel (like the angel in the picture called \"The\nReaper and the Flowers,\" with which she was familiar) carrying one of her\nschoolfellows in his arms. The vision is believed to have coincided with\nthe death, but the child was known to be dying, and no corroboration is\nnow obtainable. Miss Hervey has had no other visual hallucinations, but\nseveral auditory ones, two of which were prima facie veridical. She does\nnot. however, attach much importance to these.\nIn the next case the apparition preceded the death by two days ;\nhut it will be observed that the final stage of the decedent's illness had\nlasted more than three months. The case is curious in more ways\nthan one. It has already been referred to in Chapter VI., p. 128, as\nan instance of deferred recognition, and in the present Chapter,\np. 265, as a case of a telepathic impulse seeming, so to speak, to have\nmissed its mark and affected the wrong person ; and we shall have to\n\f284 [chap.\nReport on the Census of Hallucinations.\nrefer to it again (see Chapter XVII.) as an instance of a compact to\nappear after death if possible.\n\" A Talta, en F\u00e9vrier, 1889, nous fimes la connaissance de M.

Lorsqu'elle\neut fini, il dit que pour quelques instants elle venait de faire ressusciter son\nfr\u00e8re, ex\u00e9cutant absolument de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re ce morceau, qu'il jouait\nfr\u00e9quemment. Depuis, en voyant ma s\u0153ur, il aimait particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0\ncauser avec elle. Je puis certifier ainsi qu'elle une conversation que nous\ne\u00fbmes \u00e0 une soir\u00e9e, au mois de Mars.

Il faisait sombre dans la voiture, et pourtant en\nface de ma s\u0153ur, la regardant, je vis dans un petit jour gris qu'o\u00efl eut dit\nfactice, s'\u00e9claircissant vers le point qui attachait le plus mes yeux, une\nfigure \u00e0 la silhouette \u00e9mouss\u00e9e, diaphane, plut\u00f4t qu'ind\u00e9cise. Cette vision\ndura un instant, pendant lequel, pourtant, mes yeux prirent connaissance\ndes moindres d\u00e9tails de ce visage, qui me sembla connu : des traits assez\npointus, une raie un peu de c\u00f4t\u00e9, un nez prononc\u00e9, un menton tr\u00e8s maigre \u00e0\ntarbe rare et d'un blond fonc\u00e9. Ce qui me frappe, lorsque j'y pense \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent,\nc'est d'avoir vu les diff\u00e9rentes couleurs, malgr\u00e9 que la lueur gris\u00e2tre, qui\n\u00e9clairait \u00e0 peine l'inconnu, eut \u00e9t\u00e9 insuffisante pour les distinguer dans un cas\nnormal. Il \u00e9tait sans chapeau, et en m\u00eame temps dans un paletot comme on\nen porte au sud\u2014de couleur plut\u00f4t claire\u2014noisette. Toute sa personne avait\nun cachet de grande fatigue et de maigreur.\n\" Le domestique, tr\u00e8s \u00e9tonn\u00e9 de ne pas me voir monter, arr\u00eat\u00e9e ainsi sur le\nmarchepied, crut rlue j'avais march\u00e9 dans ma robe et m'aida \u00e0 m'asseoir,\npendant que je demandais \u00e0 ma s\u0153ur, en prenant place \u00e0 cot\u00e9 d'elle, si c'\u00e9tait\nbien notre voiture? A tel point j'avais perdu la t\u00e8te, ayant senti un vrai\nengourdissement de cerveau en voyant cet \u00e9tranger install\u00e9 en face d'elle,\nje ne m'\u00e9tais pas rendu compte que, dans le cas d'une pr\u00e9sence r\u00e9elle d'un\nsemblable vis-\u00e0-vis, ni ma s\u0153ur, ni le valet de pied ne resteraient si calme\nment \u00e0 l'envisager. Lorsque je fus assise, je ne vis plus rien, et je deman\ndais \u00e0 ma s\u0153ur :\u2014' N'as-tu rien vu en face de toi ? ' ' Rien du tout, et quelle\nid\u00e9e as-tu eue de demander, en entrant dans la voiture, si c'\u00e9tait bien la\nn\u00f4tre ? ' r\u00e9pondit-elle en riant.

I well remember seeing an announcement of his\ndemise in the papers.\"\nIn the following case the hallucination occurred within 36 hours of\nthe death. The percipient withholds her name from publication for\nreasons which seem to us adequate.\n(555. 5.) From Miss A. O.\nJanuary 21s\/, 1892.\n\" In the autumn of 1880 I was living in a farm house among the Cheviot\nhills, having gone there with some younger members of the family, quietness\nbeing desirable at home, owing to the illness of a near relative. The house\nbeing a small one, I occupied a bedroom which communicated with a sitting\nroom on the upper storey, and, being some way from the other sleeping\nrooms, it was my habit to keep a lamp burning during the entire night.\nOn the 29th of September I retired as usual in the best possible health and\nspirits, quite unaware of the then critical state of my relative, and had just\ngot into bed, witb face turned towards the wall, when I became aware of\nanother presence in the room.\n\" Turning towards the door of communication, I there saw, as I imagined,\nmy relative who was ill, standing looking at me and smiling. He was\ndressed as I had been accustomed to see him ; the light was bright, and I\nobserved every detail. I lay for a few seconds and then spoke, but getting\nno answer, jumped out of bed with hands outstretched towards the figure,\nwhich, on my approach, retreated to the outer room still smiling with peculiar\nsweetness. I followed it, and watched it vanish through the outer door,\nwhich was closed. After a moment's pause I opened the door and looked\nout, but saw nothing but a bare passage and narrow staircase, dimly lit from\nthe room in which I stood. I was not afraid, only wondering. for though we\nhad been in the habit of telling ' ghost ' stories, it did not strike me at the\ntime to associate this with anything of the kind.\n\"On the following morning I told the other members of the family of my\nexperience, and somebody suggested that it was just possible that the bright\nlight at that hour might have alarmed the man who had care of the house,\nan old servant, and that he might have come upstairs to see that all was safe.\n\fApparitions Coinciding with Illness. 287\nThough personally quite sure of the identity of the apparition, I made\ninquiries, and found that there was no foundation for the suggestion.\n\" My relative died the following night.\n\"On relating this experience some years later to a cousin, she owned to\nlaving seen the same apparition on the same night as it appeared to me. She\nherself was then recovering from a long indisposition, but her intellect was\nclear and her nerves steady. Her husband distinctly recollects being told\nby her at the time of what she had seen. She was not afraid, her feeling\nwas one of gratitude. I may add that the above is her only experience of\nthe kind.\"\nIn answer to our enquiries, Miss O. wrote :\u2014\nJanuary 28th [1892].\n\" My cousin was not in the same house as myself at the time. I am not\nsure of her address, but know for certain that she was not within 60 miles of\nit. The apparition appeared to her, I imagine, at a later hour than it did to\nme. We were young [Miss O. was 15 at the time], and went early to bed ;\nI should think, a good deal earlier than was her habit ; also, if I recollect\nrightly, she had been asleep previously. 1 do not correspond with her.\n... [I] will try to obtain her written testimony, but have little hope of\nsucceeding. I made no note of the occurrence, but know for certain that\nmy relative's illness terminated fatally on the 30th of September, 1880. It\nis, however, possible that his death may have occurred in the early morning\nhours of the 30th, which would cause my experience to have been on the\n28th\u2014not 29th, as previously stated. I am quite sure of the date of the\ndeath, and have consulted the county papers which contained obituary\nnotices. The relative was my father.\"\nThe following corroborative note was received from Miss O's sister :\u2014\nJanuary 28th, 1892.\n\"I distinctly recollect on the morning of September 30th (or 29th), 1880,\nbeing told by my sister of her experience of the previous night,\u2014before the\ntermination of our relative's illness \" K O \"\nIt will be noticed that in the three cases of apparitions coinciding\nwith illness first quoted, and very possibly in the last, the agent was in\na comatose state. In this respect, these cases contrast strongly with\nsome other cases of coincidence with illness in our collection,\u2014notably\nwith No. 34. 20, quoted below, in which the agent is at the moment in\na state of very active consciousness, in acute pain and feeling a vivid\ndesire for the help of the percipient.\nParenthetically we may remark here that, if we are right in\nbelieving that a certain number of the hallucinations described as\noccurring within 12 hours of death were not really so closely coinciden\ntal, some of them may still have been coincident with fatal illness\u2014like\nthose we have just been describing\u2014or may have occurred after death,\ntlie death being unknown (see Chapter XVII.). Por instance, the\nfollowing case is counted as a death-coincidence, because the percipient\n\f288 Report on the Genu oh of Hallucinations. [chap.\nbelieved\u2014perhaps rightly \u2014that it was so; but she also believes that\nit occurred on a Sunday, because she remembers going to church on\nthe same day, and that the death took place on the 8th of the month,\nwhich we find was a Wednesday. It appears, therefore, that her\nmemory is at fault somewhere. Possibly she went to church on a\nWednesday, or possibly the apparition occurred either during the fatal\nillness or after the death. But in any case a coincidence remains,\nsince it occurred when the family were still unaware that there was\nanything wrong.\n(460. 1.) From Miss H. L. H.\n.hdy 4tJi, 1890.\n\" I was in Staffordshire, and on the night of August 7th, 1877, retired to\nrest between eleven and twelve, but I could not sleep. About two, as near\nas I can remember, while still awake, a strange feeling came over me, as if\nI was not alone, and sitting up to look, two scenes came vividly before me ;\nin the first, I saw my dear brother (who, as I believed, was far away in\nBangkok) lying at the foot of my bed, dying. I remember I cried out, ' No\none there who loves him, and no last message.' Then I saw a coffin in the\nsame place, and felt he was dead. [I was] in good health. [Age] over 20.\n\" In December we heard that my brother had died in hospital at Singapore\non his way home, unconscious, and with no one there who knew him. At\nthe time I had this vision we were not aware of my brother's illness.\"\nThe collector, Mr. G. R. Farncombe, says :\u2014\n\"Miss H. assured me that her experience took place on the day of her\nbrother's death, but the exact hour of this she did not know. Whether she\nhad an independent recollection of the date I cannot say.\"\nIn answer to the question whether she had ever experienced any other\nhallucinations, Miss H. writes :\u2014\n\" On two occasions I have heard the voice of my father calling me by\nname, once before and once after his death. In the last [case] I appeared\nto see him as he stood by me at night.\"\nProfessor Sidgwick called on Miss H. on September 21st, 1891, and\nwrites on the same day, from notes taken at the time of his interview :\u2014\n\" The two scenes seen on the morning of August 8th were completely ex\nternalised, and appeared to be in Miss H. 's room ; the coffin in the second\nvision appeared to be across the bed. She is quite convinced that it was not\na dream in either case ; in the second case she remembers sitting up and\nlooking at the coffin. She was under no anxiety about her brother on f'\u00ab\nscore of illness\u2014he had been ill earlier in the year, but they had heard that\nhe was better. They were, however, slightly anxious on account of not\nhaving heard from him for some time.\n\" Within a week after the visions, Miss H. wrote to her father, describing\nwhat she had seen, in consequence of which he wrote to the Consul at\nBangkok to inquire about his son. Before he received an answer to this\nletter, the news came of the son's death at Singapore ; later, he received a\ncertificate of death, giving as its date August 8th.\n\fXIV.] 2N!>\nVoices coinciding with Illness.\n\" Miss H. remembers distinctly that this was the date of her visions ; it\nwas a Sunday morning ; 1 she was asked by the vicar's wife after church why\nshe looked strange and whether she was unwell. She is not a good sleeper,\nbut was not specially suffering from sleeplessness at the time\u2014was, in fact,\nin normal health.\n\"The night of August 7th there had been strange noises in the house,\nheard by Miss H. and the two other persons who were the inmates of the\nhouse besides the servants\u2014the latter having gone upstairs did not hear\nthem. The noises heard were as of heavy doors banging ; a window was\nseen to shake, and, thinking some one must be there, they went and searched\nin the yard, but found no one. The night was quiet, and the phenomena\ncould not be explained by wind. In the morning it was found that a lamp\nplaced on the window-sill had fallen and was broken, also the looking glass\nof a servant boy\u2014a ' tiger.' Miss H. did not regard the noises as supernormal\nbefore the visions had occurred ; though afterwards she was disposed to\nconnect the two. No corroboration of the coincidence of visions and death\nis now obtainable ; her father died in 1879.\"\nIn the next case the hallucination appears to have coincided exactly\nwith a severe\u2014though not fatal\u2014attack of angina pectoris.\n(34. 20.)

She wrote to me telling me of her strange dream (sic) before\nI mentioned the fact to her and before she knew that I had been ill.' \"\nMiss Ridd unfortunately could not find Miss King's original letter to her\ndescribing her experience.\nMiss Johnson writes :\u2014\nAugust 15th, 1891.\n\"I called on Miss King this morning and saw her and Miss Ridd to\ngether. Miss King gave me a verbal account of her experience, which\nseemed to differ slightly from her written account, but only, I think, because\nshe had been very careful in the latter to put down only what actually\ncame within the scope of the questions. She said that she had had a vivid\ndream of going out of the front door of her house at Exeter and meeting\nthe postman, who brought her a letter from Miss Ridd. On or in the\nletter was written, 'Come to me, Trix, I'm so ill.' Then she woke and\nheard the same words resounding in her ears. She thought it possible that\nshe had been awakened by them. I asked if it was just like a real\nperson speaking, and she said, Yes ; also if she definitely recognised the\nvoice. She could not remember exactly, but said that she thought it could\nnot have been anyone else but Miss Ridd, as no one else called her Trix.\nIt never occurred to her that it could be anyone else. She was much im\npressed by it and stayed awake a longtime afterwards. It was very unusual\nfor her to wake at all in that way in the morning.\n\" I asked how they had established the coincidence, the date being no\nwhere exactly stated. Miss King said she had written the same day to\nMiss Ridd in London, who had answered by return. As to the exact hour,\nMiss Ridd remarked, ' Don't you remember you heard the Cathedral clock\nstrike just after ? ' Miss Ridd herself had noticed the time because of\nhaving to take some medicine at four, and told how she had spoken the\nwords to the photograph of ' Trix ' in her room. I pointed out that Miss\nKing had given the time as five on the schedule. They both agreed that this\nmust have been a slip, both appearing to remember four as the hour of Miss\nKing's experience, as she says in her letter, quoted by Mr. Lauder Smith.\n\"Miss Ridd's illness was angina pectoris, which used to come on\noccasionally quite suddenly at night. There was no expectation of it just\nthen in either of their minds, and she had not had it for some time.\n\fxiv.] Voices coinciding with Illness. 291\n\"Miss King said that this was the only time she had ever heard a\nhallucinatory voice ; she had not even ever imagined that she heard herself\ncalled.\"\nMiss King writes later :\u2014\n\"I do not remember ever dreaming of Miss Ridd's being ill, except\nonce when I dreamed of her in a rather skeleton-like condition, but as she\nchanged into several other people before I woke, the dream only impressed\nitself on my mind by its grotesqueness.\n\" I had been from time to time a little anxious about Miss Ridd's con\ndition, but was not so at that time, as she had not spoken of any attacks,\nand I believed her to have been very well for some time.\"\nIt may be added that Miss Ridd has had one hallucinatory experience\u2014\nwhich, however, contains no evidence of veridicality\u2014relating to Miss\nKing. She felt her hand clasped, a face pressed against hers, and her\nname spoken distinctly.\nThe next case is one of those not taken account of in our statistics,\nbecause the sounds heard, though vocal, were not articulate (see\nChapter II., p. 36). But the impression was a perfectly definite one,\nand unique in the experience of the percipient, and the evidence for a\ntelepathic origin seems strong. It seems, therefore, sufficiently in\nteresting to be worth printing here, though excluded from the Tables.\n(105.1.) From Miss C. Clark.\n(The account was written in 1889.)\n\" I heard someone sobbing, one evening last August (1888), about\n10 p.m. It was in the house, in Dunbar, Scotland, as I was preparing\nto go to bed. Feeling convinced that it was my youngest sister, I advised\nanother sister not to go into the next room, whence the sounds seemed\nto proceed. After waiting with me for a few minutes, this sister went into\nthe dining-room, and returned to me saying that our youngest sister was\nin the dining-room, and not crying at all. Then I at once thought there\nmust be something the matter with my greatest friend, a girl of 24, then in\nLincolnshire. I wrote next day, asking her if at that hour on the previous\nnight she had been crying. In her next letter she said yes ; she was suffer\ning great pain with toothache just at that time, and was unable to restrain a\nfew sobs.\n\"I felt convinced that it was my sister whom I had just left in the\ndining-room; from the sound of the sobs I knew that she could no longer be\nthere, and thought she must have left that room and gone into the bedroom\nadjoining mine. Just after I heard the sobs,another sister came into my room,\non her way into the inner bedroom. I told her not to go there, as she would\ndisturb the sister who, as I told her, was crying.

The\nmention of ' next day ' in the original narrative as the date of Miss Clark's\nfirst letter is a mistake. I saw all the letters referred to, and verified the\nextracts. The experience was evidently very impressive to Miss Clark.\"\nHere, as in the last case, the documentary evidence shows that the\nexperience was held to be remarkable before the coinciding event was\nheard of.\nA coincidence between a hallucination and an accident to the\nsupposed agent resembles a death-coincidence in the definiteness and\nbrief duration of the coinciding event. We have five of these in the\nCensus. The best evidenced of the five, from a telepathic point of\nview, is perhaps No. 343.5, which will be found in Phantasms of the\nLiving, Vol. II., p. 141 ; a young sailor in Australia appeared to his\nsister in England within twelve hours of a narrow escape from drown\ning, the wet appearance of the phantasm and the words spoken\nadding to the force of the coincidence.\nHallucinations Coinciding with Emotional States of the Agent.\nIt would of course be difficult to classify all the possible kinds of\ncoincidences, and we may say generally that, besides those we have\nalready enumerated, there are some twenty cases in the Census with\nsome pritnd facie claim to be regarded as telepathic on account of\nthe circumstances of the supposed agent at the time of the halluci\nnation. Four of these seem worth quoting here. The first is one of\nthe cases about which there is contemporary documentary evidence ; it\noccurred when the agent was in mental trouble and her thoughts were\nstrongly directed to the percipient.\n(290. 3.) From Miss L. Caldecott.\nFebruary Uth, 1890.\n\" A sensation of faint glowing light in the darkest corner of the room\nmade me first look in that direction (which happened to be next the door),\nand I then became aware of some one standing there, holding her hands\noutstretched as if in appeal. My first impression was that it was my sister,\nand I said, ' What's the matter ! ' but instantly saw who it was\u2014a friend,\nwho was at that time in Scotland. I felt completely rivetted, but though my\nheart and pulses were beating unnaturally fast, neither much frightened nor\nsurprised, only with a sort of impulse to get up and go after the figure,\nwhich I could not move to do. The form seemed to melt away into the soft\nglow, which then also died out. It was about half-past ten at night. I was\nat my home in .

I wrote to her the day after\nthis happened, but, before my letter reached her, received one in which\nshe told me of a great family trouble that was causing her much suffering,\nand saying that she had been longing for me to help her. Another letter in\nanswer to mine then told me that her previous letter was written about 10.30\non the night I saw her, and that she had been wishing for my presence then\nmost intensely. My friend died very shortly afterwards.\n\" No other persons were present at the time. u Caldecott \"\nMrs. Sidgwick writes :\u2014\nDecember 2nd, 1891.\n\" I called on Miss L. Caldecott this afternoon. She has found one of her\nfriend's letters\u2014the one in answer to her own describing the apparition.\nThe letter is dated August 16th, 1885, so that Miss Caldecott's date in\nher account is wrong. Miss Caldecott read me out the part bearing on\nthe subject, and I wrote it down from her dictation, afterwards reading it\nover to her, while she compared it with the original. It ran as follows :\u2014\n' ' ' Your account is very strange, and I cannot quite make up my mind\nwhat to think of it. If it had not been that on that very Tuesday night I\nreally was thinking of you very much, and wishing from the bottom of my\nheart that I could get at you, I should be inclined to say that your\napparition was entirely subjective, and that you imagined you saw me. But\nif there is any connection between mind and mind, why should it not be so,\nand that it really was because I was wishing so hard I could be with you.\nYou know that was the night I got back. I unpacked some of my things,\nand then began to write to you. It was then somewhere between 11 and 12.\nAt all events, I remember it struck 12 some time after I got into bed.\n. . . . Tell me anything you can of my general appearance, and so\nforth. If you saw me as I was at the time it seems fairly conclusive it was\nmy thinking of you caused you to see me, and not indigestion on your part,\nand entirely independent of me.'\n\" It will be seen that the hour named is different from that mentioned by\nMiss Caldecott in her account\u2014between 11 and 12 instead of between 10 and\n11. But Miss Caldecott says her memory is bad, and I think she has no\nindependent recollection of the hour any more than of the day. She re\nmembers being struck with the closeness of the coincidence at the time.\nAnd the sentence in the above letter referring to the hour seems to indicate\nthat her friend also thought the hours coincided. It reads as if Miss Caldecott\nhad in her letter named a time between 11 and 12.\n\"I asked particularly about the appearance. The corner of the room\nwhere it appeared was shaded by a wardrobe. Her attention was caught\nby the light, which made her look up. It was not a bright light like a fire,\nbut it seemed to radiate out\u2014glow out. Later, she said it was the sort of\nlight you see when some one approaches along a dark passage with a candle.\nShe saw the cornice (I am not sure whether of wall or cupboard) at the\nsame time. The face and hands were the clearest parts. The hands were\nheld out, palms upwards. She looked as Miss Caldecott was accustomed\nto see her, but she did not notice the dress particularly. She did not see\nthe figure clearly at all below the knees. She showed me the sort of\n\fXIV.] 295\nOther Coincidences.\ndistance, which I should judge to be about 10 feet. The feeling of her heart\nbeating fast was only what one feels after anything sudden and startling.\nShe only felt it after the figure disappeared. She cannot at all judge of\nthe duration of the experience.\n''She has on two other occasions seen figures, both times when very weak\nafter an illness and not sufficiently recovered to be up. When she saw the\nfigure described in her answer to our questions she was remarkably well,\nand had just been taking a holiday, which she had enjoyed very much.\"\nIn the next case, the coincidence is somewhat similar, except that\nthe emotion is due to imagined, and not to real circumstances.\n(41. 3.) From Mrs. Malleson.\nHighfield, Haling Park-road, Croydon, April 12th, 1889.\n\" What I am about to relate happened in the autumn of 1874 or 1875, I\ncannot remember which, as we spent some months of both those years in\nthe same place and under very similar circumstances. We were living in a\nsmall house close upon the sea-shore, in a somewhat lonely situation,\nl\u00abtween Littlehampton and the village of Rustington. My husband and\none of our sons, about sixteen, were to take the night boat from Little\nhampton and cross to the French coast, returning in a few days. I was not\nin strong health. but certainly not ill : I was in the habit of taking long\nrides on horseback, and spending hours of the day upon the shore. . .\nWith no cause for special anxiety, I felt a little lonely and depressed\nat the thought of [my husband's] leaving me, and of our being parted\nby the sea. I determined to go to bed before they started. . . . Before\nI proceed further, I wish to say that although I had all my life been a\ndreamer of very vivid, consecutive, and striking dreams, yet I was not\nsubject to any form of nightmare, that I knew nothing of a half-waking\nstate, but, on the contrary, was always conscious of a thoroughly defined\nline between the two conditions ; and that I had never, upon any occasion,\ndreamed of being where I actually was. I mention this because it made\nthe incident I am about to relate far more striking to me at the time. I\nhad no doubt then, and I have never had any since, that I did actually\nawake when I thought I awoke, nor was I conscious of any farther awakening.\nI had slept for some hours when I was suddenly awakened by feeling\nsome one bending ever me. I was conscious of lying in the same position in\nwhich I had fallen asleep. My room was dark, yet I felt no doubt that it\nwas my husband. I felt a strange thrill and a vague anxiety, but no fear. I\ndid not doubt that it was himself in bodily presence, and yet 1 remember a\nstrange momentary feeling that he could read my thoughts. I said, ' Oh,\nW illie, you have come back ! ' I put out my arms and felt his coat. He\nanswered, 'Yes I I am come back.' I remember that the tone was very\nsolemn and my fears were aroused. I asked, ' Has anything happened ? '\nhe replied in the same peculiar low, solemn tone, ' Yes ! something has\nhappened.' Then I thought of the boy and asked eagerly, ' Where is\nEddy f ' There was no answer, and after a moment's pause I felt that I was\nalone. I raised myself on my arm and endeavoured to penetrate the dark\n\f2!J6 [chap.\nReport on the Census of Hallucinations.\nness. I looked towards the door ; I was sure there was no one in the room,\nand equally sure that there had been no sound or stir of one leaving it.\nThen in an instant came the conviction that it was not in his ordinary bodily\npresence that he had been there, and at the same time the agonising realisa\ntion that it was himself to whom something had happened, although I\nreflected that he could not have been drowned, because his clothes had not\nbeen wet to my touch. I struck a light and went to look at my watch, for\nwhich purpose I had to get out of bed ; it was five o'clock. ... I re\nmained restless, anxious, and miserable until Sunday morning, when I\nreceived a letter from my husband, my vision having taken place on the\nmorning of Friday. When my husband returned I told him of my vision.\nHe was vexed that I had been so much troubled, and merely said, ' Well,\nyou see I was in no danger, nothing was the matter, so I hope you will never\nbelieve in visions or presentiments any more ! ' I may say that although\nthis was and has remained my only vision, I was and am apt to have ' pre\nsentiments ' during his absences.\n\"K. E. Malleson.\"\nMr. Malleson writes :\u2014.\nApril 22nd, 1889.\n\" My wife has related that my son and I left Littlehampton by a steam\nboat that was to cross in the night to Honfleur. We no doubt stayed some\ntime together on deck, and then I went below to try to get some sleep, while\nhe preferred to remain in the fresh air. I got into a berth, partly undressed\nmyself, and, I believe, fell asleep, until I was awakened by two men who\nwere sitting at the table in the cabin, talking. Presently they rose to go up\nthe cabin stairs, and I said, ' I have left a boy of mine on deck. If you are\ngoing up, would you mind seeing how he is getting on '! ' They said they\nwould, and I remained quietly in my berth until they returned. To my\nquestion whether they had seen him, they replied, ' No, they had not noticed\nhim anywhere.'\n' ' Not long after this my imagination began to work upon their answer,\nat first merely as a sort of occupation for my mind, and I pictured myself\nsearching for my son all over the deck in vain, and questioning the sailors,\nand getting to hear nothing about him. Then my mind began to dwell upon\nthe supposition that I should never see or hear of my dear lad again\u2014but\nthis only as a supposition, a story, as it were, told to myself. I was\nnot in any real fear, but after a little time my imagination gained greater\nhold of me, and I found myself pacing woefully along the lonely sea road to\nour cottage with the terrible news to tell my wife that our boy was gone\u2014\nwas lost\u2014rhad fallen overboard, no doubt, and no one had even seen or\nheard him. The story had now taken possession of me, and I could not\nby any means shake myself free of it.

True, for a time I\n\fXIV.] 2!)7\nOther Coincidences.\ncould not find Eddy anywhere, but before I had become seriously uneasy I\ndiscovered him snugly hidden away under a great sheet of tarpaulin. I\ndon't remember looking at my watch, but it was daylight, and we remained\non deck a couple of hours or more before getting in to Hontteur to breakfast.\n\"When my wife told me on our return to Littlehampton how I had\nappeared to her, I refrained at the time from telling her my half of the\nexperience. She was not strong, and I feared for her the excitement of so\n.strange a corroboration of her vision. , , Wm Ma1x1won.\"\nMrs. Malleson says that she has on many occasions seen \"quite clearly\nand for a considerable time \" apparitions of persons who were elsewhere, but\nonly when she was \"either suffering in health or from anxiety of mind,\"\nexcept on one occasion, when, being \"perfectly well,\" she saw an apparition\nof a young lady who was staying in the house walking into a room in front\nof her. She followed, and found the room empty.\nIn cases such as both of those last quoted, it is, of course, difficult to\njudge to what extent the agent's condition was exceptional ; and, in the\nsecond, there is the additional doubt as to whether the experience\nmight not have been due simply to the percipient's state of mind. But\nthose who think that the fact of telepathy is proved, will feel little\ndoubt that these two cases are examples of it.\nHallucination corresponding to the Agent's Tlwtights.\nIn the next case, the coincidence is as definite and unmistakable as\ncould be desired, and any doubt as to the telepathic causation is of a\ndifferent nature.\n(31. 2.)

It occurred on\nDecember 12th, 1886 ; she had gone through a surgical operation under\nchloroform and was just recovering from the effects ; our own physician, an\nold and intimate friend, was standing by her bed feeling her pulse, when she\nthought she heard him say, ' How A. is altered ; he used to be so handsome\nand now he is quite a fat fellow. ' It struck her as a very strange thing for\nhim to say. When he had left the room she said to the nurse, ' What made\nDr. H. speak of Mr. A. ?' 'He did not, ma'am.' 'Oh, yes, he did, and\nsaid he was become quite a fat fellow.' The nurse looked at our own maid,\nwho was also standing by the bed, and who said, ' He said you were going\non all right, nothing else.'\n\" Now, they did not know it, but Mr. and Mrs. A. had called just as the\nsurgeons were leaving the house ; they came to me in the drawing-room.\nDr. H. left them with me to go up and see my sister ; when he came down\n\f298 Report on the Census of Halhicinatioiis. [chap.\nafter they were gone he used the identical words to me about Mr. A. which\nmy sister thought he had said to her ; I can only suppose that the thought\nwas passing through his mind while he had his fingers on her pulse, and\nthat, her nerves being in an abnormal state, the impression was conveyed to\nher mind, and it seemed to her that she heard him say the words.\n\"A. V. Mallet.\n\" Sophia Mallet.\"\nMiss A. V. Mallet explains that she and her sister drew up the account\ntogether, the latter adding her signature to certify that it was correct. No\nnotes were made at the time. She writes later :\u2014\nMay 31st. 1889.\n\"I was in the drawing-room with Mr. and Mrs. A. and Dr. H. when\nmy sister asked the nurse and maid. I did not hear of the occurrence till\nthe next day, as I was only allowed to see my sister for a minute or two the\nfirst evening. The nurse and maid were both repeatedly questioned, and\nnever varied in their account. The whole thing was the subject of dis\ncussion amongst us all and several of our intimate friends for some weeks.\nThe nurse we have never seen or heard of since she left, three weeks after\nthe operation. I do not even remember her name. Our maid left us a year\nago to join some relatives in America. We have no means of tracing either\nof them. My sister and I were both struck by the expression ' fat fellow.'\nIf Dr. H . had said ' Mr. A. has grown so stout ' it would not have im\npressed us nearly so much.\"\nMrs. Sidgwick writes :\u2014\nDecember 3rd, 1891.\n\"I have just returned from calling on the Misses Mallet. Miss Sophia\nMallet was still more or less under the influence of the chloroform when her\nexperience occurred, and in a somewhat dazed condition. The only hypothesis\nshe can suggest other than the telepathic is hyperiesthesia, viz., that she really\nonly heard the words when he said them to her sister a few minutes later down\nstairs. That this doubt should be possible shows that her ideas about it are not\nquite clear ; but she distinctly thinks she heard the words while Dr. H.'s hand\nwas on her pulse. They sounded far off. The room where she was is not\nover the drawing-room, where the words were actually spoken, and I was\ninformed that it was difficult to hear the piano from one to the other. Miss\nS. Mallet does not seem to remember hearing the real words spoken by the\ndoctor in her room about her being all right. She had been under chloroform\nfor about three-quarters of an hour. The matter was a good deal discussed\nand inquired into at the time, so that I should think Miss A. V. Mallet's\ni mpression about it is correct, and that she is a more ' first-hand ' witness\nthan her sister, owing to the dazed condition of the latter. \"\nThis case is interesting as a possible example of the effect of drugs\nin heightening the telepathic faculty. That there was either hypenes-\nthesia or thought-reading seems clear, and that the phenomenon was\npartly clue to the effect of the chloroform seems also certain. It is\nworth noting that we have reason to believe that the hypnotic state\n(which the effect of chloroform and other drugs occasionally resembles\n\fxiv.] Reciprocal Telepathic Impressions. 29J>\nin the suggestibility induced l) is favourable to thought-transference\nand in some cases to hyperesthesia.2\nReciprocal Telepathic Impressions.\nThe next case is a possible example of a \" reciprocal \" case, in which,\nas defined in Phantasms of the Living, Vol. II., p. 153, each of the two\npersons concerned appears to be receiving a telepathic impulse from\nthe other, so that each is at once agent and percipient. The indi\ncations of reciprocality are, however, only slight, since there is no\ncertainty that Miss 's dream gave her any information as to Mr.\nEvans' condition at the time, nor is it clear that it was exactly\ncontemporaneous. The evidence that his experience was not purely\nsubjective depends on the apparition presenting a true feature unknown\nto him (the silver cross), and is strengthened by the fact that\nMiss 's thoughts were occupied with him that afternoon.\n(78. 16.) From the Rev. C. L. Evans.\n(The account was written in 1889).\nShireshead Vicarage, Forton, Garstang, .Lanes.\n\" Two years ago I had occasion to undergo a course of magnetism, under\nthe treatment of Miss . I was under her treatment for six weeks, and\nderived considerable benefit from her treatment. A warm friendship sprang\nup between us, as she had wonderfully improved my sight. I went up to\nSt. Edmund Hall, Oxford, at the commencement of the October term, as\nmy eyes were so much stronger. One afternoon, as I had just come in from\nthe river, being rather tired, I sat down for a minute before I changed, when,\nto my great surprise, the door opened, and Miss appeared to walk in.\n\" She was looking rather pale at the time, and looked intently at me for\nabout a minute, then left the room as slowly as she had walked in. I was\nmuch alarmed, as I fancied that something must have happened to her, and\nI immediately sat down and wrote off two letters, one to Miss , asking\nif she was well, and another to my mother, telling her of the strange occur\nrence. The next day I had back the two replies. My mother said that on\nthat very afternoon she had called on Miss , and naturally they had been\ndiscussing mycase. She said that my description of Miss 's dress, &c. ,\nwas perfectly accurate. I then read Miss 's note. She stated that my\n1 See Dr. von Schrenk-Notzing, Die Bedeutwvj narcotischer Mittd fiir den\nffir\/motinmi*, in the Schriften der Gesellschaft fiirpsycholoyischc Forschung, Heft. I.,\nLeipzig, 1891.\n* It ia possible that in hypnotism there may be a correlated heightening of the\npsychical with the physical sensory faculties, though the former may not in any way\ndirectly depend on the latter. Supposing that a certain mind is constantly receiving\ntelepathic impulses, most or all of which, as a general rule, remain latent or subli\nminal, the same conditions which produce hyperaasthesia of the senses may tend to\ntranslate the subliminal into supraliminal percepts.\n\f300 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nmother had called, and had left at about half-past four, she then had lain\ndown for a few minutes, and was thinking and wishing to see me. She had\na distinct impression that she saw me during this sleep, or trance, but when\nshe awoke the impression was not very vivid. The time exactly coincided,\nand she said that my description of her was very accurate. At the time that\nshe appeared to me I was not thinking in the least of her.\n\"Charles Lloyd Evans.\"\nMr. Podmore writes :\u2014\nApril 25tft, 1892.\n' ' I called on Mr. Evans on the 20th instant, and had a long conversation\nwith him.\n\"The occurrence took place in November, 1887. It would be about\n4.15 p.m. He was resting in his chair\u2014in boating clothes\u2014with the door\najar. He heard a knock or sound as of someone entering ; turned round and\nsaw Miss come into the room and walk towards him. She was dressed\nin red bodice and dark silk skirt (a not unfamiliar dress), but with a silver\nfiligree cross hanging from a chain round her neck, which he had never seen\nbefore. He learnt afterwards that the cross had been given by General\nonly a few days before the incident. The figure looked him straight in the\nface\u2014then seemed to fade away bit by bit. He was himself perfectly well,\nand not a bit sleepy.\n\"He has had no other hallucinations. His age at the time was 20.\"\nMr. Podmore wrote to Mr. Evans' mother asking for her corroboration\nof the incidents described by her son, and she replied :\u2014\nApril 27th, 1892.\n\" In reply to the questions you asked me about the apparition of Miss\nto my son, when at Oxford, I can fully verify his statement. He wrote\nto me the same afternoon, begging me to call upon Miss and see if she\nwas ill, detailing me the account of what he had seen, and also describing\nher dress minutely and the cross she was wearing. I called upon Miss\nthe following day, and read her my son's letter, giving the hour at which she\nhad appeared to him. She told me that she had not been feeling well, and\nwas lying down. on the couch thinking, too, of my son, and that she went off\ninto a sort of trance, and she saw him distinctly looking at her and he was\nvery pale. . . . [She] told me that my son had at once written to her,\nfearing that she must be ill, and told her the circumstances under which she\nappeared to him. When I saw Miss she was then wearing the same\ndress and filigree cross which Charlie had described to me in his letter, and\nwhich he had never seen her wearing before.\n\" Mary E. Evans.\"\nMr. Podmore afterwards saw Miss , and gives the following account\n\u25a0of his interview :\u2014\nJuly 17th, 1892.\n\" I called on Miss . this afternoon.\n\" Her account of the matter is that Mrs. Evans (the percipient's mother)\ncalled on her on the afternoon of the vision, and talked much about her son.\nAfter Mrs. Evans left \u2014probably about 5.30 p.m.\u2014Miss , as usual, lay\n\u25a0down to sleep for a few minutes, and woke about 6 p.m. with the recollection\n\fXiv.] Characteristics of Veridical Cases. 301\nof having seen Mr. C. L. Evans. She can recall no details of appearance\u2014\nmerely the recollection of having been in the same room with him. The next\nday she received a letter from Mr. C. L. Evans telling of his vision, and on\nthe same day another visit from his mother. Miss was wearing the dress\nand filigree cross described. The cross, as stated, had been given to her\nonly a few days before.\n\" She is not sure of the time at which her vision or dream occurred.\nIt may have been earlier than 6 p.m., her hours being very irregular.\nShe had compared notes with Mr. Evans, and was under the impression\nthat their experiences coincided. But I think that her first statement\u2014\n6 p.m.\u2014is probably correct. If so, her dream would have come one and\na-half to two hours after Mr. Evans' vision.\"\nWe have in the Census one other seemingly reciprocal case, but we\nhave not been able to obtain enough information about it to make it\nworth considering evidentially. Cases which are clearly reciprocal\nseem to be very rare, but if established, they would be of great\ntheoretic importance as throwing light on the nature of telepathy.\nFor, especially when they contain any element of what Mr. Gurney\ncalls \" telepathic clairvoyance,\" they seem to show\u2014using his words\u2014\n\" either that A's power to act abnormally in a certain direction has\ninvolved an abnormal extension of his own susceptibility in the same\ndirection ; or else that some independently-caused extension of his own\nsusceptibility has involved the power to act abnormally.\" (Phantasms\nof the Living, Vol. II., p. 162).\nIt will be convenient, before proceeding to the next class of\nveridical hallucinations, to consider what characteristics, if any, dis\ntinguish those we have been discussing from hallucinations in general.\nThe telepathic hypothesis does not require that there should be any\ndifference. On the contrary, if all hallucinations are sensory manifes\ntations of conscious or subconscious ideas, all that telepathy has to do\nis to introduce the idea ; and there is no reason d priori why the\ntelepathically received ideas should externalise themselves as sensory\nhallucinations either more often in proportion than ideas which arise\nspontaneously, or in a different manner. Experience, however, gives\nsome ground for thinking that telepathic ideas do project themselves\nas hallucinations more readily than others ; at least, this seems to be\nthe most natural explanation of the number of telepathic hallucina\ntions as compared to the number of telepathic ideas rising above the\nthreshold of consciousness without producing sensory hallucinations.\nNo doubt, the non-hallucinatory impressions,\u2014e.g. of a dying person,\n\u2014would not, unless unusually vivid. excite special attention, but\nwould be lost in the general mass of ideas that pass through the mind.\nStill, there are instances- of feelings, impressions, and impulses to\naction, which there is strong ground for attributing to a telepathic\n\f302 [chap.\nReport on the Census of Hallucinations.\norigin (see Phantasms of the Living, Vol. L, pp. 232\u2014294), and the\nstudent of telepathy can hardly fail to be surprised that in spontaneous\ncases these are not more numerous in proportion to the hallucinations,\nunless the explanation is to be found in a special tendency of tele\npathic ideas to produce hallucinations.\nSuch a tendency would naturally be accompanied by a greater force\nand insistency on the average in the hallucinations produced, and we\nbelieve that there is some indication of such a greater insistency in the\ncoincidental cases. One indication is the larger proportion of coinci\ndental cases in which some kind of note has been made of the occur\nrence before the coincidental nature of it was known (see p. 221).\nThe larger proportion of bisensory hallucinations among coinci\ndental cases is probably another indication. In estimating the number\nof bisensory cases, it will be best to omit those which are only classed\nas bisensory because some non-vocal sound accompanied the visual or\ntactile hallucinations ; since it is often doubtful whether these sounds\nwere not real, so that to count them as hallucinatory is apt to be mis\nleading. From Table II. we see that the hallucinations described at\nfirst-hand, in which more than one sense was affected, amount to about\n9-5 per cent. of all the hallucinations. But among the 180 coinci\ndental cases which we have discussed in this and the two preceding\nChapters, more than one sense was affected in 14'5 per cent. If we\nlimit ourselves to the 80 visual death-coincidences, 17*5 per cent. is\nthe number which are bisensory or trisensory, while in the 381\napparitions of living persons with which these are to be compared, only\n12 per cent. are bisensory or trisensory.1 These differences are very\nmarked, and the conclusion that a relative preponderance of bisensory\ncases is to be found among the telepathic ones is in accordance with\nthat arrived at by Mr. Gurney on the basis of his collections of tele\npathic and purely subjective hallucinations (see Phantasms of the\nLiving, Vol II., pp. 23, 24).\nSince bisensory cages are more impressive, and therefore presumably better re\nmembered than other subjective cases, we may assume that the real proportion of tbe\nbisensory cases that are not coincidental to the whole number of non-coincidental\ncases will be considerably exaggerated in our returns : whereas we have agreed that\nwe cannot assume any material effect of forgetfillness in estimating the real number of\ntelepathic hallucinations, whether bisensory or not. Henee the real ratio of the\nbisensory telepathic cases to those which are not bisensory, must be assumed toexceed\nthe general ratio of bisensory to non-bisensory cases,by a difference much greater than\nthat shown in our statistics.\n\fXV.] Collective Hallucinations.\nChapter XV.\nCOLLECTIVE HALLUCINATIONS.\nHallucinations simultaneously experienced by two or more per\ncipients\u2014which we distinguish as \" collective \"\u2014are obviously of great\ninterest in the general consideration of the cause and nature of\nhallucinations, even if the collectivity is due to transference from one\npercipient to another by suggestion through the senses. But the\ninterest becomes still greater if, this explanation being excluded, we\nare driven to suppose, either that the transference between the per\ncipients has been effected by purely mental suggestion, or that the\nhallucinations have been simultaneously produced in both percipients\nby some supernormal cause. We have therefore examined this part of\nour evidence with special attention.\nAt first sight, the quantity of this kind of evidence appeared to be\nample\u2014at any rate so far as visual hallucinations are concerned. The\nCensus contains 95 instances, reported to us at first-hand by at least\none percipient, of figures or objects believed to have been hallucinatory\nand to have been simultaneously seen by two or more persons. To\ncompare with these we have 992 instances of unshared visual hallu\ncinations reported at first-hand, in 188 of which the percipient states\nthat he had a waking companion.1\nThe auditory collective cases reported are less numerous than the\nvisual, and bear a smaller ratio to the whole number of auditory cases.\nThere are, however, 34 cases in which two or more percipients are said\nto have heard approximately the same hallucinatory voice simul\ntaneously, in 5 of which the percipients were in different rooms. The\nnumber of unshared auditory hallucinations reported at first-hand is\n459, in 60 of which the percipient states that he had a waking com\npanion.\nCollective cases where the sense of touch is affected are\u2014as might\nbe expected-\u2014rare. Indeed we have only two first-hand cases that\ncould possibly be placed in this class, and in one of them the experience\nis too trivial and vague to be worth considering. The other is an in\nteresting case, which we have given in the discussion on physical\neffects connected with hallucinations (see p. 204). But the visual and\nauditory cases, taken together, appeared at first sight to constitute a\nstrong body of evidence for collectivity.\n1 The numbers given in this and the following paragraph apparently disagree with\nthe Tables, since in some of the collective cases more than one percipient is included\nin the Census, and in the Tables each percipient in the Census is reckoned separately.\nThere is no case in which two percipients both see an appantion and at the same time\nhear a voice, so that the numbers given of visual and of auditory collective cases are\nmutually exclusive.\n\f304 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nA closer inspection, however, showed us that important deductions\nhad to be made from this evidence : since there are special reasons fur\ndoubting either the collective or the hallucinatory character of a con\nsiderable number of the experiences.\nFirst as regards the collective character. We are so accustomed in\nordinary life to find our visual and auditory experiences shared by\nothers, that the assumption of their having been so shared on any par\nticular occasion is probably liable to be made\u2014at the time or after\nwards\u2014on insufficient grounds. At any rate we have found in a few\ncases that a supposed second percipient, when applied to, has no recol\nlection of the incident ; which renders it doubtful what his impression\nwas at the time. Second-hand evidence for collectivity cannot there\nfore be ranked above second-hand evidence for other questions con\nnected with hallucinations : and it is only in 43 out of the 95 visual\ncases reported as collective that we have been able to obtain evidence\nof the sharing of the experience, beyond the recollection of one per\ncipient\u2014partly because the second percipient is often dead or has been\nlost sight of.\nBut, granting that the perception was collective, there may still be\nroom for doubt as to whether it was really hallucinatory. We have\nalready 1 given reasons for thinking generally that some of the ex\nperiences counted in our Tables were mistakenly reported as hallucina\ntory, and further that this mistake is especially likely to be made out\nof doors. The fact, therefore, that over 44 per cent. of the collective\nexperiences occurred out of doors, and only about 15 per cent. of those\nthat were unshared, renders it probable that proportionally more of the\nformer have been erroneously regarded by the percipient as hallucina\ntory : and this probability is strengthened by the fact that a larger\nproportion of out-door cases are collective, than of indoor cases in\nwhich the percipient had a waking companion.2 The presumption thus\nafforded is confirmed by Jin examination of the evidence in particular\ncases. If we go through the realistic human apparitions that occurred\nwhen the percipient was up, asking ourselves this question\u2014\u2022\" If the\nfacts are correctly stated, is it certain that the figure seen was not a\nreal human being?\"\u2014we find that we answer \"No\" in a considerably\nlarger proportion (nearly double) of collective cases than of others, and\nthis though we leave entirely out of consideration the collective\ncharacter itself. Of course, an estimate of this kind has, as a statistical\nstatement, only a relative value. A judgment so formed is sure to\ni See Chapter II., p. 37 ; Chapter V., p. 98.\n'\u2022'Taking only those cases where the percipient had a waking com]ianion, we finl\nthat, out of 1!)4 where ho was indoors, 53 or 27 lier cent. are said to have been\ncollective ; and out of 88 where he was out of doors. 42 or nearly 48 per cent. are snid\nto have been collective. In one case, it is not stated whether he was indoors or not.\n\fxv.J CoUeclive Hallucinations. 305\ndepend largely on the idiosyncrasies of the person judging, and more\nover fuller or better given evidence might alter the aspect of the case.\nThere seems, however, no reason why, if the same person judges of both\nthe collective and non-collective cases, the same errors of judgment\nshould not affect both classes equally ; so that this relative estimate\nmay be taken as fairly trustworthy. In view of these considerations,\nwe think that any conclusions about collective hallucinations must rest\nupon individual cases carefully scrutinised, and not on the alleged\nnumbers, respecting which we cannot regard ourselves as having\nsufficiently accurate information. We shall, therefore, only quote\nhere some of those which seem to be evidentially the best cases.\nCollective Visual Hallucinations.\nBefore we proceed to give fresh narratives, we may remind the\nreader that we have already come across three cases believed to\nhave been collective among the death-coincidences. In the first of\nthese, No. 147. 23, p. 218, the evidence of the second percipient is\nunobtainable, but if there is no exaggeration, the description makes it\ndifficult to suppose that there was any mistake as to the complete and\nindependent recognition of the figure by both percipients. In the\nother two cases (Nos. 422. 25, p. 227, and 418. 4, p. 230) the account is\nsigned by three and two percipients respectively, and in the second we\nhave ascertained that the percipients believe themselves to have seen\nthe figure independently\u2014that is, without verbal suggestion by one to\nthe other.\nIn the case we have next to quote, there is\u2014apart from the\ncollectivity\u2014no element of coincidence. It seems a clear case of\ncollective hallucination, the disappearance of the cat proving it to\nhave been hallucinatory.\n(535. 2 and 3.) From Mrs. Greiffenberg and Mrs. Erni-Greiffenberg.\nThe collector, Mr. F. C. S. Schiller, tells us that he heard the story in\nOctober, 1890, from the two percipients. The following account was put\ntogether by him from an account (which he also sent us) written by Mrs.\nErni-Greiffenberg, and various conversations which he had with both ladies\non the subject. He afterwards obtained their signatures to it. Neither of\nthem has had any other hallucinatory experience.\nDecember Uth, 1890.\n\"In the beginning of the summer of 1884 we were sitting at dinner at\nhome as usual, in the middle of the day. In the midst of the conversation\nI noticed my mother suddenly looking down at something beneath the table.\nI inquired whether she had dropped anything, and received the answer,\n' No, but I wonder how that cat can have got into the room ? ' Looking\nunderneath the table, I was surprised to see a large white Angora cat beside\n\f306 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nmy mother's chair. We both got up, and I opened the door to let the cat\nout. She marched round the table, went noiselessly out of the door, and\nwhen about half way down the passage turned round and faced us. For a\nshort time she regularly stared at us with her green eyes, and then she dis\nsolved away, like a mist, under our eyes.\n\" Even apart from the mode of her disappearance, we felt convinced that\nthe cat could not have been a real one, as we neither had one of our own,\nnor knew of any that would answer to the description in the place, and so\nthis appearance made an unpleasant impression upon us.\n'' This impression was, however, greatly enhanced by what happened in\nthe following year, 1885, when we were staying in Leipzig with my married\nsister (the daughter of Mrs. Greiffenberg). We had come home one after\nnoon from a walk, when, on opening the door of the flat, we were met in\nthe hall by the same white cat. It proceeded down the passage in front of\nus, and looked at us with the same melancholy gaze. When it got to the\ndoor of the cellar (which was locked), it again dissolved into nothing.\n\"On this occasion also it was first seen by my mother, and we were both\nimpressed by the uncanny and gruesome character of the appearance. In\nthis case, also, the cat could not have been a real one, as there was no such\ncat in the neighbourhood.\n(Signed) \"Mrs. Erni-Greiffen-berg.\n\"Mrs. Greiffenberg.\"\nIn the following case there was no vanishing, and the figure left the\nfield of view as a real figure would have done, but it was clearly\nrecognised by both percipients, and it is difficult to suppose that the\nreal person came into the church and forgot all about it. It is on this\nthat the evidence for the hallucinatory character of the experience\ndepends.\n(647. 7.) From Miss C. J. E.\nMarch, 1892.\n\"I was playing the harmonium in the church of at about 4 p.m.,\nAugust, 1889, when I saw my eldest sister walk up the church towards the\nchancel with a roll of papers under her arm. When I looked up again she\nhad disappeared, and I thought she had just come in for a few minutes and\ngone out again ; but when I asked her afterwards what she wanted in the\nchurch, she was much surprised, and told me she had been in the rectory\nlibrary all the afternoon, studying genealogical tables. I am not sure of the\nexact date, but it was about the time I mention.\n\" I was practising on the harmonium ; as far as I remember I was quite\nwell and not worried about anything. I was eighteen years old. A younger\nsister was the only other person in the church with me at the time. She\nwas standing beside me on an old stone coffin, and also noticed my eldest\nsister walk up the church with papers under her arm, but thought it nothing\nunusual and looked away, and when she looked back again my sister had\ndisappeared.\n\"My eldest sister looked just as usual and wore her hat and jacket, as I\nand my younger sister both noticed. She walked rather briskly, looking\n\fXV.] 307\nCollect ive HaUucinations.\nstraight before her. She assures us that she was sitting alone in the\nrectory library (the rectory is within a stone's throw of the church) all\nthe afternoon.\"\nIn answer to the question whether she has had any other hallucinations\nMiss E. says: \" I have seen dark forms in my room at night when there was\nno one in the room but myself, but as I am nervously inclined I am nut very\npositive about it, as it may have been partly imagination. But the appari\ntion [of my sister] I positively saw.\"\nMiss E. writes further :\u2014\nApril Uth, 1892.\n\" I am quite sure that the figure could not have been any one else looking\nlike K., for I saw distinctly every detail of her face and figure and dress,\nand noticed that she was looking straight before her. My sight is excellent,\nand I know I could not have been mistaken. When I looked up, the figure\nwas about three yards from me, I should say. The figure may have gone\nback past jne without my noticing it, but I think it very improbable, as\nI was sitting with my face towards the aisle through which it must have\npassed.\"\nThe other percipient, Miss H. E., writes :\u2014\n'' My sisters and I were spending the day with our uncle at ; as\nhe is the rector his garden leads into the churchyard. In the course of the\nafternoon C. and I went into the church ; she began to play the harmonium\nand I stood on a stone coffin beside her with my hand on her shoulder ; my\nsister was playing a hymn and I was looking down at the book to read the\nwords. C. casually looked up ; I did the same, and following the direction\nof her eyes saw K. walking to us up the church with\u2014and this rather\nsurprised me\u2014a long bundle of papers in her hand. We made no remark\nand took no further notice of her movements, for when we go to\nwe often just wander in to see the church. It was certainly K. herself ; I\ncould see her face quite well. C. and I finished our hymn and found that she\nhad gone. C. and I soon after went in to tea. At tea we were surprised to\nhear K. say, ' I am so sorry I did not see the church, but part of the\nafternoon I was looking at pedigrees in the study; before that I passed the\nchurch gate ; I was going in, but turned back to the study instead,' or\nwords to that effect\/ C. and I exchanged glances, but said nothing.\nHowever, next morning we attacked K. on the subject ; she was much sur\nprised, had certainly not been in church at all, but had first been in the\nlibrary studying the family pedigree, and then gone to the church gate and\nreturned. My sister and I both have perfectly good eyesight. It seems im\npossible that K. can have visited the church, but my sister and I are both\npositively certain that we saw K. or her likeness.

I went into the library,\nand, being interested in genealogy, studied my uncle's family pedigree until\ntea time, when I remarked to my sisters that I had not been to the church\nall the afternoon, and they told me that they had seen me there. I felt no\nunusual sensations during the afternoon, and am much mystified by the\nincident.\"1\nA case of a recognised figure seen out of doors is the following :\u2014\n(317. 14.) From Miss A. E. R.\n(The account was written in 1890.)\n\" When out in camp in an Indian jungle, my sister and I were anxiously\nawaiting the return of her husband, who had left in the morning on a\nsurveying expedition, promising to return early in the afternoon. Between\nsix and seven p.m. we were very uneasy, and were watching the line of\nroad, I should say, 200 yards distant from where we stood. Simultaneously\nwe exclaimed, 'There he is,' and I distinctly saw him, sitting in his dog\ncart driving his grey horse, the syce occupying the seat behind. We at once\nreturned to the tents\u2014my sister ordering the bearer to get the Sahib's bath\nwater ready, and the butler to prepare dinner\u2014I running to set my brother-\nin-law's mother's mind at rest as to the safety of her son. However, as\ntime passed on, and he did not appear, our alarm returned, and was not\nallayed until he arrived in safety at eight o'clock. On interrogating him,\nwe found he was just starting from the surveying ground, about eight miles\ndistant, at the very time we had the above related experience. I should\nadd, we were both in good health and certainly wide awake at the time,\nand I have never before or since had any experience of the kind.\"\nMiss B. was about ten years old at the time of this incident. Her sister,\nMrs. H. , writes to the collector, Miss B. Garnett :\u2014\nDecember 17th, 1890.\n\" In answer to your request, I write to say that I fully endorse the state\nment made by my sister with reference to our experience in India.

I may add that the\ntime I saw my husband was about the hour I expected him home. He had\nbeen detained later than he expected, and I know would be concerned as to\nmy anxiety about him. I have never had any other similar experience.\"\nIn tliis case the proof that the figure was not real depends not so\nmuch on the recognition\u2014for the distance was probably too great for\ncertain recognition\u2014as on the combination of that with the very\ngreat improbability that any human being whatever was driving a\ndog cart in the place at that moment.\nIn the following case the apparition was that of a dead person, and\nthere seems to be little room for mistake as to its hallucinatory\ncharacter.\n(728. 16.) From Dr. S. da G.\nMarch 17th, 1892.\n\" I saw what seemed to be myfiancee's sister at a window in the garden.\nHer head was tied up in a handkerchief ; I approached her, but on arriving\nopposite the window I found it closed. Nobody was there ; yet one moment\nbefore I had seen the form, and I did not hear the window close, for which,\nindeed, there was no time. I stood before the window, gazing at it in\nperplexity, when suddenly the panes seemed to disappear and the same\nform was leaning on the sill looking out upon me. It was not the sister of\nmy fiancee ; I recognised the appearance as that of my fiancee's mother, for\nI had seen her portrait in the house. I retired towards the place where\nmyfiancee was sitting. I was horrified, but not to alarm her I did not run.\nWhen I came back to her she saw the form accompany me. It was visible\nonly down to the waist. She had also seen what she supposed to be her\nsister at the window, and told me not to pay her any attention. There was\nat the time some misunderstanding between them. As I was going up the\nsteps of the verandah 1 felt as it were a finger pulling me back by the\ncollar. I did not look back, but G. screamed out, ' Look\u2014my mother ! '\nand fainted away.

It was visible from the waist up. She\ndoes not remember if it had a handkerchief tied round its head or not.\nShe thought that the form at the window was that of her married sister, but\nshe afterwards recognised her mother.

Goodhall.\"\nMr. Podmore writes :\u2014\nJune 7th, 1892.\n\" I called to-day on Mrs. Goodhall. The figure was seen, according to\nthe testimony of both ladies, in all but full daylight\u2014a quite unmistakable\nfigure. They could not determine which saw it first. But their interest\nwas aroused at once, because, as both assured me, the figure seemed to\nglide, not walk. Mrs. Goodhall described the face as fiendish. Miss\nGoodhall said that it had a nasty expression, and a large mouth ; like a\nman's coarse features in a woman's dress. Miss Goodhall looked round\nat once, and the figure had disappeared. It could not have disappeared if\na real figure, as the distance from the hedge was too great. The vision\ncan have lasted only a few seconds in all.\n\" Miss Goodhall has had no other hallucinations ; but Mrs. Goodhall has\nhad two or three auditory hallucinations.\n\"Mrs. Goodhall wrote a full account of the vision seen by herself and\nMiss Goodhall to her married daughter, in India at the time. The letter has\nunfortunately been destroyed ; but Mrs. told me that she remembered\nreading of the incident.\n\"I also saw an account written in a diary by Mrs. Goodhall three\nyears (or more) after the event ; which corresponds, almost word for word,\nwith the account given to us.\"\nIn the case of unrecognised figures collectively seen out of doors, it\nis usually on their unexplained disappearance that the evidence for\ntheir hallucinatory character depends ; and the value of this evidence\nis often hard to estimate. We referred in Chapter V. (p. 98) to a case in\nwhich the two percipients took different views of a figure seen by them\n\u2014one regarding its mysterious disappearance as explicable on the\nhypothesis that it was a real man, and the other holding the opposite\nopinion. When the two percipients agree that a real person could not\nhave got out of sight in the manner in which the figure was seen\nto disappear, we must, at least, regard the disappearance as difficult of\nexplanation*; and this was, doubtless, the case in the experience just\nquoted.1 Still, while there is the smallest possibility of bodily disap-\n1 This statement applies also to No. 513.3, which was printed in the Journal of\n*he S.P.R., Vol. VI., p. 137.\n\f312 Report on the Census of Hallucinations.

This is the case with\nthe following experience1\u2014where, however, the figure seen was very\nindefinite.\n(49. 2 and 3.) From Mr. and Mrs. C.\n(The accounts were written in 1889.)\nMr. C. writes :\u2014\n\"The place, my father's house, a village rectory in the Eastern Counties;\nthe room, that in which my mother died ; the time, night, between 12 and\n3 a.m. ; date, July, 1879. My wife and I were both asleep, when I woke\nsuddenly, found her sitting up, also just awake ; she said : ' What is that?'\nAt once I pointed to where, at the bottom of the bed, I saw indistinctly a\nwhite figure, unrecognisable, which at once vanished. I got out of bed\nand explored the room. There was no moonlight effect to account for the\nexperience, the shutters being shut ; no white garment, no apparent cause.\nWe were both startled by the mutual experience, which was too short to\naccurately investigate ; but we undoubtedly were both awakened at the\nsame time by the consciousness of the presence of something in the room ;\nboth saw the same white unrecognisable figure, in the same place. I was\nasleep, but awakened into possession of every faculty at once by the\nconsciousness of the above experience. We were both in excellent health.\nMy mother had died some ten years before, and we had not been speaking\nof her ; in fact, I had not told my wife that the bedroom we occupied was\nthat in which my mother had died. The figure was too evanescent and\nunrecognisable, and insufficiently defined in outline, to identify. My wife\nwas with me at the time, and gives her account so far as she remembers it.\nI should not have thought any more at all of the experience, but for the\nidentity of our mutual experience. The date was no particular anniversary,\nnor impressed, by any event afterwards heard of, on the mind.\n\"C. V.

My husband was with me, and experienced exactly\nthe same sensations. g j, ^ \u201e\nNeither Mr. nor Mrs. C. has ever had any similar experience.\nMr. Myers writes :\u2014\nOctober 13th, 1891.\n\"I saw Mr. and Mrs. C. to-day. They are quite sure that each\nindependently saw the figure. The incident occurred when they were\npaying their first visit to Mr. C.'s father's house after their marriage. It\nwas the first time that Mr. C. had been in that room since his mother's\ndeath. There was no light in the room, and they cannot tell how the\nmoving object, ' like a white petticoat,'. was seen.\"\nHere the vagueness of the figure and the dimness of the light seem\nto leave room for the supposition that the experience was an illusion,\nrather than a hallucination, although the percipients failed to discover\nany basis for illusion. In this respect the case resembles a collective\nexperience (No. 196. 2) quoted in Chapter V., p. 100.\nIn the next case the visual hallucination is of a slight kind, but its\ncollective character appears unmistakable.\n(37. 13.) From Miss H. Wilson.\nThe Cottage, Ditchingham, Bungay, August. 1888.\n\"It was Sunday night. F. T., my cousin, Mrs. H. (an old servant and\nfriend of the family), and I were sitting in the drawing-room.

Suddenly the light disappeared, so that I could not\ngo on reading. I looked round quickly, and saw a dark shadow pass\nbetween me and the candles. The shadow was so thick as to seem almost\nlike a substance, but I did not see any shape. We both exclaimed, ' I\nthought both the candles were going out,' and F. said, 'It seemed to me to\ncome from the door.' When the shadow had passed, the candles were perfectly\nclear and steady ; the old nurse was stooping low over the fire, on the same\nside of the room as we were.

It passed from the direction of the door, past Miss\nT., and Miss Wilson saw it just as it passed between herself and the\ncandle, and then disappeared behind her. She is very positive that it could\nnot have been due to any wind or mere flickering of the candle. It was a\nsolid-seeming mass of almost black shadow. The occurrence made a strong\nimpression upon Miss T., who is very nervous.\"\nMr. Podmore wrote to Miss T. for a fuller account, especially as to\nwhether she saw the shadow before Miss Wilson, which the latter believed to\nhave been the case.

I do not think I can say anything more.\"\nThis case, as will be seen, is at once collective and coincidental :\nbat, in the absence of any recognition, the coincidence, we think, is\nnot sufficiently close to establish clearly the telepathic origin of the\nexperiences. If we regard the origin as telepathic, it will be another\nexample of the phenomenon of deflected telepathic communication,\ndiscussed on p. 265; since it was the old nurse who was concerned\nwith the dying man.\nCollective Auditory Hallucinations.\nWe now pass to collective auditory hallucinations.

I felt utterly terrified, and\n1This case has already appeared in Phantoms of the Living, Vol. II., p. 203.\nWe have accordingly given the percipients' accounts as there published.\n\f318 Report on the Census of Hallucinations.

I put out my hand and touched Lady C, saying, 'Did yon\nhear that?' She said, 'Oh, don't! Just now 1 saw something going across\nthe room ! ' We were both a good deal frightened, and tried to go to sleep\nas soon as we could. But I remember asking Lady C. exactly what she had\nseen, and she said, 'A sort of white shadow, like a spirit.' The above\noccurred at Bishopthope, York.\" ,.2 j j, ..\nThere are about 8 cases more or less of this type in our collection,\nbut the evidence in most of them is deficient in various ways. The\nfollowing is an auditory case of the kind, which, though one of the\npercipients was young at the time and the evidence of the other can\nno longer be obtained, seems to us worthy of consideration. The\nsurviving witness is well known in the educational world, in which\nhe occupies an important position. It will be observed that the experi\nence is coincidental as well as collective.\n(289. 13.) From Mr. P. B.\nJirne loth, 1890.\n\"I heard my grandfather call me by name in our own house. I was\nabout nine, and not of nervous temperament, nor apprehensive of any\nthing. I cannot fix the date, and quite forget the exact hour ; but my\nmother thought at the same moment that she heard herself called, and\nwe both came, from different rooms, to answer. I did not know what my\ngrandfather was doing or where he was at the time. As a matter of fact\nhe was, at the same time, dying at Fenchurch Street Station.\"\nMr. B. states that he has never had any other experience of the kind.\nMr. Podmore writes :\u2014\nNovember 21th, 1891.\n\" I called to-day on Mr. B. His grandfather's (mother's father; namewns\nS. L. ; he lived at Prestwich, near Manchester : but he died quite suddenly\n(Mr. B. could not state the cause of death) at Fenchurch Street Station,\nin or about 1808. He was about 84 years old at the time, and apparently\nwell and hearty. He had come up from Manchester a few days before on\npurpose to see his grandson before he went to school. He was much\nattached to the boy. Mr. B. was living with his parents at Bow at the time,\nand was about 9 or 10 years old (he is now 33). Mr. L. had gone out for\nthe afternoon ; was expected back for dinner at about 6 p.m. There was\n\fXV.] 319\nCollective Hallucinations.\nno cause for anxiety at all. Sometime between early dinner and 6 p.m.\n(probably about 3 p.m.) Mr. B. thought he heard his grandfather call him,\n'Percy': he ran into the hall and met his mother, who thought she had\nheard her father call, 'Sarah.' Mr. B. recognised the voice, and states\nthat his mother (now dead) recognised it also. He is pretty sure that it\nwas not a real sound mistaken for the grandfather's voice. As Mr. L. did\nnot come in at 6 p.m,. Mrs. B. grew anxious, and went out to search for\nnews of him ; and whilst she was absent\u2014about 7 p.m.\u2014a messenger came\nto announce the death. Mrs. B. was much impressed by the coincidence of\nthe voice with the death. She was by no means a nervous or fanciful\nwoman ; and, her son believes, had had no other experience of the kind.\nHi. B.'s father\u2014 the only other witness\u2014is dead.\n\"Mr. B. trusts the accuracy of his own memory for the facts here set\ndown. He has had no other experience, and has no special interest in the\nsubject.\"\nAnother case which is, in its essential features, of the same nature\nas a collective hallucination with different percepts, will be found in\nChapter XVII., p. 383, (No. 726. 14). Here, however, the experience\nof one of the percipients seems to have been a pseudo-hallucination\nrather than a completely externalised sensory hallucination.\nThe class of cases in which one percipient sees an apparition, while\nhe and others collectively hear a non-vocal sound, such as footsteps,\nor see a door opening and closing, has already been discussed in\nChapter X. In such cases it is generally possible that the noise or\nmovement was real, and it may in some cases even have been the\nimmediately suggesting cause of the hallucination.\nExplanations of Collective Hallucinations.\nThe reader has now before him the cases in the Census which seem\nto us on the whole to afford the best evidence for collective hallucina\ntion. Here, as with the death-coincidences, there is of course no\nsharp line marking off the more convincing cases from the others.\nDifferent judges would probably form different estimates, and some, for\ninstance, of the narratives from the Census already printed in the\nJournal of the S.P.R., Vol. VI., and referred to in foot-notes on\nprevious pages, might in the judgment of some persons seem more\nimpressive than some of those in the present chapter.\nThe cogency of the evidence in the aggregate will also be differently\nestimated by different persons. Few, however, are likely to regard it\nas strong compared with that for apparitions coinciding with deaths,\nand if the case for collective hallucinations rested on the Census alone,\nit would perhaps be rash to regard it as conclusively proved that hallu\ncinations may be shared. It does not so rest, however. Readers of Phau\n\f320 Report an the Census of Halhtcinations. [chap.\ntasms of tlve Living will remember that a considerable mass of evidence\nfor collective hallucinations was there presented and discussed (seeVol.\nII., Chapter XVIII.), and since then further cases have been received\nand laid before the Society from time to time in the Journal. Among the\nlatter, we may especially refer to the case of the brothers Ellwood\n(Journal, Vol. IV., p. 286) who state\u2014-in an account written within\ntwo months of the experience\u2014that they simultaneously saw a halluci\nnatory figure standing at their bedside ; the case of three sisters\u2014the\nMisses Du Cane\u2014who collectively saw the figure \"of a young man of\nmiddle height, dressed in dark clothes and wearing a peaked cap,\" which\nvanished \" within a few inches of \" two of them {Journal, Vol. V., p.\n224) ; the case of Lady B. and Miss B. (Journal, Vol. VI., p. 145);\nand, finally, the very remarkable case narrated by Miss Atkinson\u2014a few\nmonths after the experience\u2014in an account (Journal, Vol. VI., p. 230)\nfrom which we extract the following :\u2014\n' ' My friend had been telling me of a very dear old friend of the\nfamily [Dr. ] who was buried in the church. ... I remember\nthat the neglect of his wish [to have a window put in to his memory]\nquite made me angry. . . . Just then I saw an old gentleman behind\nus, but, thinking he was looking over the church, took no notice. But\nmy friend got very white and said ' Come away, there is Dr. !' Not\nbeing a believer in apparitions, I simply for the moment thought she\nwas crazy, though I knew they were a ghost-seeing family. But when\nI moved, still looking at him, and the figure before my very eyes\nvanished, I had to give in. . . . When we got outside my friend told me\nthat his was the figure which came to different members of their family so\noften, and, indeed, had been the cause of their leaving one house.\"\nTo all this previous evidence, that included in the Census adds\nmaterial confirmation, and we do not think it can reasonably be\ndoubted that collective hallucinations occur, though unmistakable\nones are somewhat rare.\nIf this be so, we may probably regard our collection as a\ntypical one ; and may conclude from it that collectivity is fairly\ndistributed over the different classes of hallucinations ; since an\nanalysis of the cases stated to be collective shows that all the classes\ninto which we have divided visual and auditory hallucinations are\nadequately represented among them, except visions and religious\napparitions.1\nAnother point on which our statistics are calculated to throw light\nis the question how far hallucinations tend to be shared, when there\nis more than one person present. As already stated, the cases in\nthe Census in which a visual hallucination is shared are about\na third of those in which we know that two or more persons\n1 See Table in Appendix F.\n\fXV.] 321\nCollective Hallucinations.\nwere together and awake\u2014namely, 95 out of 283. Among the 95\ncases there are 38 in which there were more than two persons present,\nand in 23, or about three-fifths, of these all present shared in the\nexperience. At first sight, therefore, it appears legitimate to infer\nthat shared visual hallucinations are more rarely unseen by some\npresent than hallucinations confined to a single percipient. But in\nview of the probability that in collective cases many of the supposed\nhallucinatory objects were real, it would be unsafe to draw any\ninferences from this ; especially as, among the 38 cases, examination\nshows that in a considerably larger proportion of those where all\npresent saw the object than of the others, there are grounds for sus\npecting that the objects were real and not hallucinatory.\nWe may further use our collection as a basis for the discussion of\nthe important question, how any hallucinations at all come to be\ncollective. There are four possible hypotheses apart from the supposi\ntion that the object collectively perceived, while not belonging to the\nordinary external world, was yet a real object subject to physical laws.\nThe difficulties of this supposition have been discussed by Mr.\nGurney in Phantasms of the Living, Vol. II., Chapter XVIII., and\nneed not detain us now.\nOf the remaining four hypotheses, the first is that some real\nexternal object suggests to each percipient through the senses a\nhallucination which assumes a similar form for each owing to similar\nassociations and trains of thought. This explanation seems to us\nadmissible in special cases, e.g., in No. 317. 14, p. 308, where, as both\nsisters were actually expecting to see the same sight in the same place,\nsome movement in the distance may have acted for both as a starting\npoint for the hallucination. But, as the narratives above given suffi\nciently show, this explanation cannot cover more than a small part of the\ncases of alleged collective hallucinations, and we must therefore for\nthe remainder have recourse to one or more of the other three hypo\ntheses. These are :\u2014\n(1) That a hallucination experienced by one percipient is trans\nferred to the other by verbal or other suggestion through the ordinary\nsenses.\n(2) That the hallucination of one percipient is similarly transferred\nto the other, but telepathically\u2014by mental suggestion.\n(3) That there is an external agent directly affecting the minds of\nboth percipients and producing a hallucination independently in each,\nin some supernormal manner.\nThe last hypothesis has been amplified by Mr. Myers in a \" Note\non a suggested mode of psychical interaction,\" appended to Phantasms\nof the Living, Vol. II., p. 277, el seq. The view there set forth was\nT\n\f322 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nthat in all cases there is an agent, who is himself telepathically or\nclairvoyantly affected, and that the appearance of this agent, A, to\nthe percipients, B and C, depends on A's own perception of his own\npresence (psychically) in the scene where his phantasm is observed.\nNow there is, no doubt, a small amount of evidence supporting the\nview that persons clairvoyantly or telepathically perceiving a locality\nto which they feel themselves temporarily transported, as it were, may\nsometimes manifest themselves more or less clearly to a person in that\nlocality. The experience of Mr. and Mrs. Newnham, in which Mr.\nNewnham dreamt very vividly that he saw Mrs. Newnham, to whom\nhe was then engaged, going upstairs in her own house, and that running\nup after her, he clasped her round the waist ; while Mrs. Newnham, who\nwas actually going upstairs at the time, thought she heard his step\nand felt his arms, 1 is a case in point. And another possible case is one\nof Dr. Backman's experiments, in which a clairvoyant girl describes a\nroom in which a gentleman was sitting\u2014he at the same time imagining\nthat he saw a woman.2\nBut the evidence of this kind in our possession in not, in the view\nof the majority of the Committee, sufficient to justify us in regarding\nrecriprocal telepathic influence as a completely established fact ; and\neven if it were otherwise, the rarity of the proved cases of reciprocity\nwould still be a serious objection against admitting the hypothesis\nthat we are now considering as a universally applicable explanation\nof collectivity.\nFurther, if this reciprocal action between agent and percipient were\na general explanation of collective hallucinations, we should expect to\nfind that the agent, when a living person, was sometimes aware of it ;\ne.g., in the case of Miss K. E., seen by her sisters in the church,\np. 306. But in the present collection we have no instance among\nthe collective cases of consciousness of any reciprocal action : and\nthere is only one such case\u2014an auditory one\u2014in Phantasms of the\nLiving.3\nFinally, if Councillor Wesermann's record of an experiment, given\nin the Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VI., p. 287, be accepted as trustworthy\n\u2014and we know no reason for distrusting it\u2014it seems to us to afford a\ncrucial instance against the theory that reciprocal action between the\ndistant agent and the percipients is a necessary condition of collective\npercipience. In this case we have an apparition experimentally pro\nduced\u2014an apparition not of the agent himself, but of a dead person ;\nit appears to the person whom the agent intended to impress, but not\n1 Phantasms of the Living, Vol. I., p. 225.\n2 Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VII., pp. 206-207.\ni Vol. II., p. 164 (No. 308).\n\fXV.] 323\nCollective Hallucinations.\nin the place where the agent believed the percipient to be ; and it\nappears not only to the intended percipient, but to a person unknown\nto the agent, and of whose local proximity to the intended percipient\nthe agent was entirely unaware, until informed of it through the\nordinary channels of intelligence. Hence it seems clear (1) that the\nagent's success in impressing the percipient whom he intended to\nimpress was entirely independent of the locality of the latter, and (2)\nthat the channel of communication with the secondary percipient was\nthrough the first percipient and not through the agent's thought of\nthe locality.\nThe question, however, still remains whether the mere fact of col\nlective perception of an apparition is a ground for supposing some\nsupernormal action of an external agent on the joint percipients. This\nsupposition is difficult to reconcile with the numerous1 cases in which\nthe person represented in a collective hallucination is known not to\nhave been passing through any crisis at the time of the halluci\nnation : but a stronger argument against it lies in the cases where the\napparition is not human. The cat, for instance, in No. 5.35.2 (see p.\n305) can hardly have caused its apparition by projecting itself\npsychically first into one house and then into another, in which the\npercipients happened to be.\nIt is true that collective non-human apparitions are rare, but so are\nnon-human apparitions which are not collective ; indeed, collective ex\nperiences are more than proportionately represented in the non-human\nclasses.2\nOn the whole then, we can only allow, at most, a restricted applica\ntion to the hypothesis that in collective hallucinations an external\nagent affects both percipients directly. In a considerable proportion\nof cases we have to fall back on the other two hypotheses, and suppose\nthat the phenomenon is due to the influence of one percipient on the\nother, either through ordinary or through telepathic suggestion. Of\ncourse, in cases in which there is a distant agent,\u2014as in Councillor\n1 In 14 of the 27 cases reported to us of recognised apparitions of living persons\ncollectively perceived, the person represented appears, from the statements made, to\nhave been at the time in a perfectly ordinary condition.\n- In one case in our Census (No. 296. 1) a hallucinatory chair is said to have been\nseen by two persnoe ; one of whom (Mrs. 8avile Lumley) describes the experience\u2014\nwhich occurred many years ago\u2014as follows :\u2014\n\"While taking a lesson in drilling and callisthenics, with a class of girls, at 20,\nCamden Place, Bath, in the forenoon ... I and another girl distinctly saw a\nchair over which we felt we must fall, and called out to each other to avoid it,\nbut no chair was there. All chairs were removed to make room. [I was] 14 or 15, in\ngood health. Several [persons were present], but only one other saw the same\u2014the\ngirl who was immediately behind me.\"\nY 2\n\f324 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nWesermann's case, and presumably in the coincidental cases,1\u2014the\nexperiences of the simultaneous percipients may be both directly pro\nduced by him ; but, even when this is to some extent the case, we are\ndisposed to think that they are still seldom wholly independent of each\nother. If they were, it appears to us in the first place that. considering\nthe variety of forms that telepathic impressions take, the hallucina\ntions of different percipients in collective cases would be more often\ndecidedly divergent than they are\u2014would appeal to different senses,\nfor instance, or one percipient would see an apparition standing and\nanother would see it sitting, one would see it in one dress and one in\nanother, etc. Or, if this does not happen because the form of the\nphantasm is due to the agent's thought, we should at least expect that\nit would generally be seen by the different percipients to occupy\ndifferent positions in the room.\nIt is not necessary to suppose that, if there is action by one\npercipient on the other, or mutual action between their minds, their\npercepts will in all respects agree. For instance, in No. 703. 24\n(see p. 317), where the hallucinations affected different senses, they\nmay still have been the result of thought-transference between the\npercipients. All that we are maintaining is that it is difficult or\nimpossible to explain the degree of agreement which we usually\nfind on the assumption that the percepts are independent of each\nother.\nWe pass, then, to consider what, in collective cases, is the nature of\nthe action between the minds of the percipients. Does it take place\nthrough the ordinary channels of sense, or is it telepathic ? As regards\nthe first hypothesis, we explained in Chapter X., pp. 176-7, that we\nhave at present no conclusive evidence for the possibility of the sudden\nproduction of a sensory hallucination in a person in an entirely normal2\nstate, by word or gesture. But it is quite possible that the vividness\nof impression, produced in A by the hallucination, may be required in\norder to enable his word or movement to convey the impression to B\nwith hallucination-producing force. A mere idea or effort of the\nimagination is a very different thing from the feeling of reality which\na hallucination momentarily gives. At any rate, it would not be safe\nto assume that the action between the minds has been telepathic, unless\n1 The proportion of collective cases among coincidental hallucinations in the\nCensus is slightly smaller than among hallucinations generally, but there is not a\ngreat difference. Seven visual death-coincidences are said to have been collective\nout of 26 in which the percipient had a wakingcompanion.\n2 The instances known to us in which hallucinations have been produced by\nverbal suggestion, outside the hypnotic state, are either (a) cases of persons who\nhave previously been hypnotized, or (b) cases where the effect has been produced by\nprolonged and insistent effort.\n\fXV.] 325\nCollective Hallucinations.\nwe have excluded the possibility of ordinary suggestion, and it is\nvery difficult to exclude this completely. There is hardly a case among\nthose which we have given in the course of the present report, where\nwe can feel sure that it did not operate in some degree. It is\nobvious, however, that suggestion of this kind would more easily\naccount for the phenomenon in some cases than in others. If the\nfigure seen is that of a person who is well known to both percipients,\nwho is more likely to be in that place than any one else, or still\nmore if he is actually expected by both (as in No. 317. 14, p. 308), a\nvery small amount of sensory suggestion from A might convey the\nidea to B, and if they were both to have hallucinations they would\nbe likely to have similar ones. On the other hand, if the figure seen\nis an unfamiliar one (as in No. 535. 2, p. 305, and 256. 17, p.310), we can\nhardly conceive that the idea of it could be conveyed from one per\ncipient to the other through the senses in the brief time available. No\ndoubt there is a possibility that in comparing notes immediately after\nthe experience, the percipients may have unconsciously brought their\nrecollections into a unison of detail not warranted by the original\nimpressions. But our enquiries have not produced any positive\nevidence that this has occurred : and to suppose it to have occurred to\nthe extent required in order to explain collective hallucinations\nentirely by sensory suggestion, seems to us unwarrantable and ex\ntravagant.\nWe think, therefore, that in the explanation of these cases, the\nhypothesis of ordinary suggestion must be at least supplemented by\nthat of telepathic suggestion. For those who believe in telepathy, mental\nsuggestion is really an easier explanation of collective hallucinations than\nverbal suggestion ; for not only can we imagine the idea thus conveyed\npictorially, as it were, and with full details, in an instant, but we have\nactual experimental instances of hallucinations telepathically produced\nin persons in a normal state, by the intention of another person. In\nthese experimental cases, moreover, the effect was produced under\napparently less favourable circumstances\u2014namely, greater distance and\nabsence of any indication that there was anything special to be looked\nfor.1 On the whole we are inclined to think that in collective cases\nthere is generally a combination of telepathy with suggestion by word\nor gesture, each helping the other ; and that this is the reason why\nthe proportion of collective cases out of those in which a second\npossible percipient was present is large compared with the proportion\n1 In visual collective cases there must generally be at least the indication given\nby the direction of the eyes\u2014an indication to which most of us are habitually sensi\ntive. For evidence of this among cases printed in this chapter, see especially Nos.\n535. 2 (p. 305), 647. 7 (p. 306), 256. 17 (p. 310).\n\f326 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nof successful cases of telepathy among those in which we must suppose\nthat persons dying, or in some other crisis, have desired to communicate\nwith their friends.\nThe Sharing of Hallucinations by Animals.\nBefore concluding this chapter, we have to discuss a special class\nof alleged collective hallucinations of which nothing has as yet been\nsaid \u2014those, namely, in which it is believed by our informants that\nanimals who were present with them when they saw apparitions\nshared in the experience. There appears to be some evidence (occa\nsionally very slight) of this in 15 out of the 27 cases in the Census\nwhere the presence of animals1 is recorded.\nThere is, so far as we know, no reason to assume that animals\ncannot experience hallucinations ; but it is necessarily very difficult to\nprove that they do experience them ; because, as they cannot describe\nwhat they see and hear, we can only infer it from their behaviour, for\nwhich there may be other causes besides the apparition. In some\ncases it is at least as plausible to suppose that the emotion of the horse\nor dog is caused by the behaviour or appearance of his master when\nseeing the apparition, as to suppose it caused by any sharing of his\nmaster's hallucination. For instance, consider the case of Mr. Maint-\nchitch, quoted in Chapter XVII. Mr. Mamtchitch tells us, at p 389,\nthat certain effects observable by those with him are produced on himself\neach time he sees the apparition which has so frequently recurred in\nhis experience. Is it not probable that the behaviour of the dog de\nscribed at p. 390 was due to the distress caused by his master's unusual\nstate rather than by seeing the apparition, especially as he does not\nseem to have behaved as he habitually did when a stranger intruded\ninto the room?2 When the action of the animal which leads to the\ninference that he is a co-percipient precedes the seeing of the appari\ntion by the human percipient\u2014which is said to have occurred in 5 of\nthe 1 5 cases in which animals play a part\u2014there is, no doubt, generally\nsuggestion from the animal ; but that may be the whole of his share in\nthe phenomenon. In the following case, for instance, the dog's growl and\nthe direction of his gaze suggested to Mr. S. that some one was coming\nin ; but the dog's action may have had quite a different cause.\n1 In all but one of these cases, the animal was either a horse or a dog. In the\nother case it was a parrot, but the details of the account are too meagre for it to be\npossible to lay any stress on it.\n- The evidence for Mr. Mamtchitch's little son sharing his hallucination on one\noccasion tsee p. 3'JO) is much stronger than that for the dog's doing so ; because,\nthough the child could scarcely speak, he could say enough to show that he thought\nhe saw a woman.\n\fXV.] 327\nCollective Hallucinations.\n(157. 11.) From Mr. H. E. S.\nAugust 8th, 1892.\n\" [When aged about 18] about the year 1874, in my father's house, I got\nup one summer morning about five o'clock, and lighted a fire to get myself\nsome tea. A large bull-terrier dog used to follow me about everywhere, so\nof course he had to be near me when I was getting the fire to light. He\ngave a short growl and looked towards the door ; this caused me to look\nround, and to my great terror I saw a tall, dark figure with flashing bright\neyes coming into the kitchen towards me. I screamed for help and fell to\nthe floor. My father and brothers ran down from their bedrooms thinking\nthat thieves were in the house. I told them what I had seen, but they\nsaid it was an imagination caused by a recent illness. But why should the\ndog have seen something as well as myself ? This dog often used to see\nthings invisible to me. He would start and snap at them, and then turn to\nme a look with his big eyes, as much as to say : ' Did you see that ? ' \"\nIn this case the percipient had had two other hallucinations,\none before, (at the age of five years), and one after that here quoted,\nso that he probably had a more than average susceptibility to them ;\nthough it appears that the dog's behaviour often suggested the presence\nof things invisible to him, without producing a hallucination.\nIn the two following cases there is even less indication that the dog\nsaw the apparition, though there is a good deal of indication that he\nwas the cause of his master's seeing it.\n(116. 11.) From the Rev. J. W.\n(The account was written in 1891.)\n\"[I saw] lady looking into room about 12.30 [a.]m. ; saw her in clear\nmoonlight ; about the year 1862. [I was] reading and writing, till called\nout by howling of dog. [I] believed she was on [the] sea at the time. No\nperson present, but the dog shared the experience, as he was in the utmost\nterror. [I have] never again [had such an experience. I] took no notes\nbut never forgot it.\"\n(283. 25.) From Mr. L. D.\nJawumj, 1890.\n\"I was awakened by a little dog (which used to lie at the bottom of my\nbed), and looking towards the window, I distinctly saw the figure of a\nwoman. She was dressed in a low necked dress and short sleeves bunched\nup on the shoulder. I asked about it and could gain no information.\"\nIn the following case it is doubtful whether the dog's excitement\nbegan before or after the experience of the human percipient. It will\nbe noticed that to those persons who did not see the apparition, the\ndog's behaviour does not appear to have at the time suggested the need\nof a supernormal explanation.\n\f328 Report on the Census of Hallucinations.

Mon mari\naccusait la femme, Mme. T. accusait le mari, qu'elle avait toujours beaucoup\naim\u00e9, mais dans ce cas elle ne l'excusait pas.

From Captain C.\nDecember bth, 1891.\n\" Between 10 and 11 one moonlight night, in December, 1866, or\nJanuary, 1866, in Darjeeling, whilst riding my hill-pony at a sharp trot\nalong the mountain road from that station to the convalescent dep\u00f4t, Julla-\npahur, where I happened to be stationed at the time on sick leave,\nI suddenly saw before me what appeared to be a dead native, wrapped in a\nwhite sheet, and lying stretched across the road. My pony evidently saw the\napparition, or whatever it was, at the same time, for he instantly reared up\nand fell over backwards with me on the road, and dragged me close to the\nedge of a ' khud ' or precipice. 1 regained my feet just in time, and raised the\nprostrate animal by the bridle. Found it trembling in every limb, and much\nfrightened. Looked round angrily to ' wig ' the native\u2014thinking him to be,\nperhaps, a drunken Bhootea, or Hill-man, lying there, when, lo and behold !\nhe had disappeared ! On one side was the precipice, on the other the precipi\ntous mountain side, clothed with a few trees higher up, and not an object else\nto be seen but the white roiid! Mounting, and making my way half or three-\nquarters of a mile further on to my bungalow, I handed the pony over to one\nof my servants. He presently came to me and said, ' Sir, what is the matter\nwith the pony ; he is trembling all over ? ' After a while, my syce, or groom,\ncame running up and entered the stable. (It is usual for native grooms, or\nsyces, in India to run on foot after their masters' horses.) He likewise soon\npresented himself before me, saying, ' Sir, what is wrong with your pony ; he\nseems to be much frightened ? ' I then told him what had happened, and\nasked if he had met or seen anyone on the road ? ' No, sir ; not a soul all the\nway,' replied he. ' Did you notice anything strange at all ? ' ' No ; nothing\nwhatever, sir.'\n\" I remained some months after that at Jullapahur, and never could I\nride my pony up and down that road leading to Darjeeling without his\nshowing the utmost trepidation whenever he approached that particular\nspot. I may mention that I was a good deal cut and bruised by the sudden\nand unlooked-for fall, and so also was the unfortunate pony. And to this\nday I cannot account for my adventure.\n\" [I was at the time] on nine months' sick-leave from Bhootan, where I\nhad contracted fever during the campaign, but was convalescent at the time,\nand able to go about in the better climate of the hills at Darjeeling ; was\nthen. about 24 years old.\"\nIn answer to enquiries, Captain C. adds :\u2014\n' ' The apparition, when I first saw it, seemed to be quite close\u2014a yard or\ntwo only in front of my pony's head. I came across it very suddeidij in trot\nting quickly round a sharp curve of the road, which curve was made by the\nroad running round a somewhat pointed spur of the mountain there jutting\nout. The road was white\u2014 a good and smooth one\u2014and the night bright\nmoonlight, with occasional intervals of less light, i.e., when the moon became\nobscured by passing clouds, but even then it was by no means too dark to see\nobjects around. Bhooteas and other Hill-men were in the habit of visiting\n\f330 [CHAP.\nReport on the Census of Hallucinations.\nthe bazaar (Darjeeling) with loads of firewood, fowls, and vegetables for sale,\nand some of these occasionally indulged too freely in arrack and toddy, and\nhave been known to lie about the roads in a state of intoxication. I conse\nquently took my apparition at first to be a drunken Bhootea, lying wrapped\nup in his sheet on the road ; but the remarkable thing is, if so, where could\nthe fellow lmve disappeared to so very rapidly and completely, for on my right\nhand was the tremendous 'khud,' or precipice, and on my left nothing but\nthe steep mountain side, up which there was nothing to prevent my seeing a\ngood way till the trees were reached. I had in those days, and have still,\ncapital sight, and having had rather a stirring life, having gone through many\na tiying and dangerous experience, both in time of war and of peace\u2014the\nIndian Mutiny campaign, and Bhootan War, etc. \u2014I am not easily upset or\nfrightened. But what the thing could have been beats my comprehension,\nnor could any of my brother officers or friends in Darjeeling at the time, or\nafterwards, solve the mystery.\"\nReaders of the Journal will remember that it has been maintained\n(see Journal S.P.R., Vol. IV., p. 296-7) that \"one of the most\ncommonly reported incidents connected with a post-mortem phantasm\nis the evident terror shown by animals present at the time, a feature\nwhich,\" the writer says, \" is absent, so far as I know, in phantasms -of\nthe living.\" He calculated that of the cases published by the S.P.R.,\nanimal terror was not recorded in connection with any recognised\nphantasm of a living person, but was reported in about 12 per cent. of\nother cases, \" nearly all unrecognised, but generally assumed by the\npercipient to be post-mortem, for reasons more or less cogent.\" This\nresult is not confirmed by the present collection. Fear or alarm\nseemed to have been exhibited by the animals in about 8 of the 15\ncases in which they are supposed to have seen the apparitions seen by\nhuman percipients. In one of these, viz., No. 116. 11 (see p. 327), the\napparition was of a living person ; in one, viz., No. 422. 22, (see p. 390),\nof a dead person ; and in the other six unrecognised. In none of the\nunrecognised cases is there any good reason for associating the\napparition with a dead person, and, except in one case (No. 80. 21,\nsee Journal S.P.R., Vol. IV., p. 139), no reason is even suggested.\nOn the whole the reported cases of animals seeing apparitions tlo\nnot appear to us to afford material support to the evidence for\ncollectivity, nor need they, we think, influence our views as to its\n\u2022causes.\n\fXVI.] 331\nPremonitions.\nChapter XVI.\nPREMONITIONS AND LOCAL APPARITIONS.\nIn Chapter XIV. we gave some instances of hallucinations\noccurring during the illness of the persons whom they represented or\nsuggested to the percipient. We there regarded such an experience as\ndue to telepathy,\u2014 supposing it to be probably contemporaneous with a\ncrisis of illness and caused by the condition of the mind or nervous\nsystem of the person passing through the crisis. At the same time, we\nare aware that, where the illness had a fatal termination, the popular\nview of such a hallucination\u2014so far as it was regarded as more than\nmerely subjective\u2014 would be that it was \" premonitory\" of the death\nthat followed.\nWe do not think that there is any adequate justification in the\ncases which we have given, or in other cases of the same kind,\nfor introducing the vast difficulties involved in this view. There is\nno sufficient reason for regarding them as caused differently from\nother hallucinations occurring during the illness of the persons\nrepresented or suggested, where the illness does not end fatally,\u2014of\nwhich we have given two examples. But in view of the traditional\nbelief that apparitions of living persons are generally premonitory of\nthe death of the person represented, it may be worth while to men\ntion that out of the 301 such apparitions\u2014other than death-coincidences\n\u2014reported to us in the Census, it is stated in only 22 cases that the\nperson represented died some time after ; the interval between the\napparition and death varying from 15 hours to a year. Of these 22,\n7 coincided with a sudden and fatal illness of the agent, unknown to\nthe percipient (being included in the 11 cases of coincidence with\nillness mentioned on p. 278). In 6 other cases, the apparition occurred\nduring the course of an illness, about which the percipient was in\nmore or less anxiety. There remain therefore only 9 cases1\u2014in two\nof which the interval between hallucination and death was as much\nas a year\u2014which we have no ground for attributing either to tele\npathy or to anxiety ; and these are clearly insufficient to show that\nthere was any real connexion between the apparition and the death\nthat followed it. Indeed, it can hardly be said that the circumstances\nstrongly suggest such a connexion, except in one case (No. 1. 5), where\nthe percipient, lying awake in bed in the early morning, saw an appari\ntion of her brother sitting in the room. About 15 hours later, he was\nkilled in a railway accident. The incident occurred about 25 years\nbefore it was reported to us, and no corrolwration is obtainable.\n1 One of these is No. 470. 1, see p. 19%\n\f332 [chap.\nReport on the Census of Hallucinations.\nThere are, however, seven or eight cases of hallucinations of a\ndifferent kind (that is, other than recognised apparitions of living per\nsons) which have perhaps a primdfacie claim to be regarded as prescient\nor premonitory. Of these we proceed to give the most interesting ; but\nwe cannot regard them as constituting an important addition to the\nevidence already collected on this subject.1\n(458. 9.) From Mrs. McAlpine.8\nGarscadden, Bearsden, Glasgow, April 20th, 1892.\n\" I remember in the June of 1889, I drove to Castleblaney, a little town\nin the County Monaghan, to meet my sister, who was coming by train from\nLongford. I expected her at 3 o'clock, but as she did not come with that\ntrain, I got the horse put up, and went for a walk in the demesne. The day\nwas very warm and bright, and I wandered on under the shade of the trees\nto the side of a lake, which is in the demesne. Being at length tired, I sat\ndown to rest upon a rock, at the edge of the water. My attention was quite\ntaken up with the extreme beauty of the scene before me. There was not a\nsoimd or movement, except the soft ripple of the water on the sand at my\nfeet. Presently I felt a cold chill creep through me, and a curious stiffness\nof my limbs, as if I could not move, though wishing to do so. I felt\nfrightened, yet chained to the spot, and as if impelled to stare at the water\nstraight in front of me. Gradually a black cloud seemed to rise, and in the\nmidst of it I saw a tall man, in a suit of tweed, jump into the water\nand sink.\n\" In a moment the darkness was gone, and I again became sensible of the\nheat and sunshine, but I was awed and felt ' eerie,'\u2014it was then about\n4 o'clock or so\u2014I cannot remember either the exact time or date. On my\nsister's arrival I told her of the occurrence ; she was surprised, but inclined\nto laugh at it. When we got home I told my brother ; he treated the subject\nmuch in the same manner. However, about a week afterwards, a Mr. Espie,\na bank clerk (unknown to me), committed suicide by drowning in that very\nspot. He left a letter for his wife, indicating that he had for some time con\ntemplated his death. My sister's memory of the event is the only evidence\nI can give. I did not see the account of the inquest at the time, and did not\nmention my strange experience to any one, saving my sister and brother.\n\"F. C. McAlpink.\"\nMrs. McAlpine's sister writes :\u2014\nRoxboro', February 15th, 1892.\n\" I remember perfectly you meeting me in Castleblaney, on my way home\nfrom Longford, and telling me of the strange thing which happened in the\ndemesne. You know you were always hearing or seeing something, and I\npaid little attention, but I remember it distinctly\u2014your troubled expression\nmore than the story. You said a tall gentleman, dressed in tweed, walked\npast you, and went into a little inlet or creek. I think, but am not sure,\nthat you said he had a beard. You were troubled about it, or looked so ;\nand 1 talked of other things. You told me while we were driving home.

I am sure of that being the day, but cannot remember\nthe date. It was in June, and on the 3rd of July, 1889, a Mr. Espie, a\nbank clerk, drowned himself in the lake in the demesne in 'Blaney. I have\nno doubt that the day I came home you saw Mr. Espie's ' fetch.' \"\nThe following account is taken from a local paper, the Northern Standard,\nSaturday, July 6th, 1889 :\u2014\n\"Sad Case of Suicide.\u2014The town of Castleblaney was put into a fearful\nstate of excitement when it became known on Wednesday last that Mr.\nEspy had committed suicide by drowning himself in the lake in the demesne.\nLatterly he was noticed to be rather dull and low in spirits, but no serious\nnotice was taken of his conduct, nor had anyone the most remote idea that he\ncontemplated suicide. On Wednesday morning he seemed in his usual health,\nand, as was customary with him, walked down to get his newspaper on the\narrival of the 9.45 train from Dublin. He met Mr. Fox (in whose office he\nhas been for years) at the station, and having procured his paper walked up\nto the office, wrote a note in which he stated what he was going to do and\nindicating where his body would be found. This seemed to concern him a\ngood deal, for he seemed very anxious that his body should he recovered\nwithout any delay. He had fishing tackle in his pocket, and having tied\none end of a pike line to a tree, and the other end round one of his legs, he\nthrew himself into about three feet deep of water, where he was found\nshortly afterwards quite dead, and before the note that he had left in the\noffice had been opened.\"\nIt is possible that, if we knew more about the intending suicide,\nwe should perceive that the simplest explanation of this case is\na telepathic one. If the clerk's mind was brooding on his purpose\nof putting an end to himself, and on the spot which, as the letter\nhe left shows, he may have already selected for the purpose, the\nfact that the percipient was at that place, and that her mind was\ntherefore occupied with it also, may have afforded the connecting link\nrequired to enable her to receive the telepathic impulse.\nIn the following case, we cannot be sure, in the first place, that sub\nconscious physical sensations did not suggest the prophecy and, in the\nsecond, that the expectation created by the prophecy did not bring\nabout the punctual but unsuccessful attempt to fulfil it.\n(690. 1.) From Mrs. T. E.\n[The following account was written by the collector, from information given\nhim verbally by the percipient, Mrs. E., who afterwards signed it. It was\nenclosed in a letter dated Berlin, April 14th, 1890. For other experiences\nof Mrs. E.'s, see pp. 174 and 186.]\n\" Mrs. E. told me, herself, each and all of the occurrences related in this\npaper while I was in Berlin in April, 1890.\n\" Mrs. E. is a widow lady and an American, but of English extraction ;\nshe describes herself as being not imaginative, not credulous, not eccentric,\n\f334 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nnot hysterical, nnd not of a neurotic constitution. She has had one or two-\n' low, nervous fevers,' but neither in the feverish condition, nor in that of\nconvalescence, has she had any hallucmations.\n\"Throughout her entire life she has been 'haunted ' with presentiments\n(being able to foretell future events both in her own life and in other persons'\nlives), as well as being tormented by 'voices and 'visions,' the most\ntypical of which are concisely given below. She describes both the voices and\nvisions as being invariably of the nature of intruders bursting in upon and\ndisturbing the current of thoughts at the moment. All the hallucinations\nwere most vivid and apparently ' real.' This susceptibility is apparently\ntransmissible, for Mrs. E.'s only daughter is the subject of similar hallucina\ntions. Mrs. E. yet hears voices, often daily for some time.\n\" All the recorded cases happened in America.\n\" [The following] occurred in the year 1845. Mrs. E. was in good health,\nand had at that time, had none of the before mentioned fevers, which came\non between the ages of 30 and 50. Mrs. E. had slept well, and was in the\nact of getting up, when apparently the quiet was broken in upon by an\nannouncement being made as though someone had come in at the bedroom\ndoor, and said in a loud voice these words :\u2014' To-day at 6 o'clock you will\ndie.' There was nothing more, but these words seemed to resound through\nout the room. Mrs. E. resolved to tell no one of the announcement, and\nalso not to brood over it, if possible, at all. To accomplish this, she went\nin the course of the afternoon to the house of a married sister of hers,\nwhere there would be sure to be something more or less stirring going on.\n' ' This had the effect of distracting the attention from the certainly very\ndistressing prophecy, and Mrs. E. had the benefit of her sister's society till 6\no'clock began to be struck by the clock. As it commenced sounding Mrs. E.\nsaid to herself, ' There now, it's 6 o'clock already and nothing has happened,'\nbut the statement was premature, for before the chime ceased, blood was\ngushing out of both nostrils in a copious stream. The alarm was raised,\nand the whole household flocked round and applied the usual remedies of\ncold keys, &c., but quite without success. This profuse and alarming\nhfemorrhase did not cease till bucket-fulls of cold water were poured on the\nhead and down the spine. When the doctor arrived he said a very large\nquantity of blood had been lost, and life only just saved and no more.\n'\"As might be well expected, Mrs. E. was very weak for days after this\noccurrence. Though this was the first in point of time of the more im\nportant hallucinations of Mrs. E.'s life, it is in certain respects quite the\nmost extraordinary by reason of the striking sequel to, and almost complete\nfulfilment of, the prophecy. up p H\nMrs. E. adds :\u2014\n\" I certify that this report is correct. \u201e, g j, ,,\nMrs. E. at our request obtained the following corroborative note from\nfrom her sister :\u2014\nMay 18th, 1890.\n\"At Mrs. E.'s request, I write to inform you that I am her sister,\nand it was at my house [that] the haemorrhage of her nose took place on the\nday when it was announced to her, that at six o'clock on that day she would\n\fPremonitions. 335\ndie, and according to the prediction, this haemorrhage came on before the\nclock had done striking six, and continued until she was greatly exhausted,\nand after everything had been done to stop it.\n\" I willingly certify to the truth of all my sister has told you about this,\nand in her experience in seeing and hearing unnaturally, as it has always\nbeen known in our family. t q\nIn an earlier premonitory experience of this percipient, which we give\nfrom the same narrative, the narrator's words themselves suggest that the\nprophecy tended to cause its own fulfilment.\n\"The very earliest occurred when she was quite a girl. On this\noccasion, when she was in a crowd, a voice by her side (apparently) said\nquite distinctly, 'That man will be your husband.' The person whom she was\nlooking at at the moment did, years after, become her husband. At the\ntime of the announcement she did not know him ; the ' spell ' of this shaped\nher course when she ultimately did make his acquaintance.\"\nIn the next case again, the indication given by the apparition is\ntoo vague and doubtful to add strength to the case for premonitions.\n(587. 5.) From Mrs. Cockman.\n26, Dartmouth Park Avenue, London, N.W., November 2nd, 1891.\n\"At 29, Grove Road, N.W., on November 12th, 1882, at 5.30\na.m., I saw, being wide awake at the time, a slight ethereal looking figure\nstanding at the side of my bed, its face turned towards me, and gazing wist\nfully at me. We always slept with the bedroom door wide open to admit of\nthe light coming in from a gas jet which was immediately over the door on\nthe landing. By this light, I saw the figure pass slowly into the next room\n(the door of which was also wide open), where our eldest son, a boy of 10,\nwas sleeping. I woke my husband and told him what I had seen. He went\nat once into our son's room to make sure he was not walking in his sleep (a\nthing he had never done), but from the position of the bed-clothes and from\nthe boy's sound calm sleep, this theory was upset. My son went to school\nas usual in the morning, apparently in good health, but on coming home in\nthe afternoon complained of feeling unwell, and the following day scarlet\nfever declared itself. I at once connected the vision with my son's illness.\nI was myself in good health at the time, and free from anxiety. My age\nwas 34.\"\nMrs. Cockman adds the following account of an apparently telepathic\nincident.\n\" In 1878, I had a presentiment, while spending the evening with some\nfriends, that all was not right at home. I combated this feeling, but could\nnot conquer it, and begged my husband to take me home at once. On our\narrival, directly the door was opened, I heard a harsh grating sound coming\nfrom the nursery, and on rushing upstairs, found my little girl of two con\nvulsed with croup. The child was quite alone in the room, the nurse\nhaving left her, thinking she was asleep.\n\"Matilda Cockman.\"\n\f336 Report on the. Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nMr. Podmore writes :\u2014\nMarch 30th, 1892.\n\" I called on Mr. and Mrs. Cockman to-day. As regards the first incident,\nMrs. Cockman explained that she had probably been lying awake some little\ntime\u2014it was about 5.30 a.m. She is sure that she was completely awake.\nShe saw the figure clearly, but did not recognise it. The figure was clearly\nvisible as it went round the corner into the next room, from which there\nwas no other exit. Mr. Cockman corroborated, and expressed himself\nconvinced that the figure could not have been a real figure.\n\" Both are quite certain that the figure appeared on the night of\nSunday-Monday (12th-13th November, 1882), and that the boy came home\nill from school on Monday, the 13th. That this date (November 13th, 1882)\nwas actually the beginning of his illness is proved by an entry in a small\nbook (shewn to me) given on the following Christmas day, by Mr.\nCockman to Mrs. Cockman, in commemoration of the boy's recovery.\n\" There was no anxiety. It was not known that scarlet fever was in the\nschool until later.\n\" In the second case they were dining out near Addison Road, intending\nto spend the evening there. No special cause for anxiety. In accordance\nwith her usual custom, Mrs. Cockman had asked a lady friend (in this case\na trained nurse) to stay in the house, together with the ordinary nurse,\nduring her absence. All through dinner she felt very uneasy and uncomfort\nable, and immediately that Mr. Cockman and the other men returned to the\ndrawing-room, she insisted on going home, and actually reached home about\n9 p.m.\u2014two hours earlier than she had intended. Her uneasiness was not\nconnected at the time with the child ; it was merely a vague sense of some\nthing wrong at home. Mr. Cockman remembers the incident well. He\nbelieves it to be unprecedented in their lives. Mrs. Cockman, though rather\nnervous about her children, had no special cause for anxiety (there had\nbeen no previous warning of croup) and had never on any other occasion\nallowed any feeling of nervousness to interfere with plans.\"\nMr. Cockman corroborates as follows :\u2014\n26, Dartmouth Park Avenue, N.W., March 30th, 1892.\n\" Dear Sir,\u2014I have pleasure in stating in writing that I distinctly\nremember the two occasions to which my wife refers, and remember speaking\nof the first the next day to two of my colleagues. When my wife saw the\napparition, she waked me and I instantly went into the room towards which\nit had moved, but both the boys were fast asleep, and from the position of\nthe bed-clothes one could easily see they had neither of them been out of\nbed. The clothes were closely tucked up.\n\" On the other occasion, when my little daughter had croup, I do not\nremember quite so vividly all the circumstances, but do remember my wife's\ngeneral feeling of uneasiness, and that she begged me after dinner to let her\ngo home, that she felt something was wrong at home\u2014and we left much\nearlier than we should have done in the ordinary way. Arrived there, we\nheard, the instant the door opened, the ominous barking croupy sound, and\non my wife's going upstairs she found the child almost in convulsions. She\nhad gone to bed quite well, and was at the top of the house, where the nurse\nhad not heard her. I did not make a note of the date of this occurrence\u2014\n\fXVI.] 337\nPremonitions.\nI do not think we then thought so much of such things as we should now.\nOf the first apparition we have means of fixing the dates very exactly.\n\" C.

The third case is the following : \u2014\n(293.13.) From General M.\nApril 20th, 1890.\n\" I was a captain in the staff of the army at the siege of Delhi, in 1857 ;\nand, among other duties, often carried orders and messages for the general\nin command.\n\"On one occasion I was sent by the general with some message or\norders for Sir Charles Reid, who commanded all our advanced posts along\nthe well-known ' ridge.'\n\" He was not at his headquarters, but had gone towards the ex\ntreme right and most exposed part of the ridge, so, leaving my horse\nunder cover, I proceeded on foot along the road towards the ' right\nbattery.' Just as I reached a turn of the road, which was specially\ndangerous owing to its being enfiladed by the enemy's guns in position,\nI heard my name called out, on the left hand, and, seeing a group of\nofficers standing by the breastwork which lined the front of our position,\nI went towards them ; and, just as I left the road, the spot was torn\nup by a shower of grape-shot, which, had I been there, must have killed\nme ! As I approached the officers, among whom I expected to find Sir\nC. Reid, one of them remarked on the narrow escape I had just had :\nbut on my asking why they had called out to me, I was told, to my utter\nsurprise, that no one had done so ! I heard the summons, however, which\nsaved my life ; and whether I fancied that some other of the many sounds\nin the air at the time was my somewhat peculiar name, or whether the call\nto me at that fortunate moment was a ' spirit voice,' as one of my friends at\nonce pronounced it, or was altogether the product of my own imagination ;\u2014\nthe facts remain that I heard, or thought I heard, an unrecognised voice\nsummon me from the road ; that by obeying the summons I escaped death,\nor at any rate very serious wounding ; and that no human being had so\ncalled out to me !\n\" I had to hunt for Sir C. Reid, at a still more remote part of the ridge ;\nall along which a hot fire was being kept up ; but I delivered my message,\nunharmed, and without any other incident occurring, or any other ' hair\nbreadth 'scape ' that I know of !\nz\n\f338 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\n' ' My journal of the Delhi Siege has been lost or stolen, so I cannot give\nthe exact date\u2014and may, perhaps, have omitted some detail of the 'ex\nperience.' It was, however, some day in July or August, 1857, when the\n' ridge ' was, as we used to say, extra ' lively.' \"\nUnrecognised Local Apparitions.\nWe now come to the consideration of a class of cases in which the\narguments for assuming a supernormal cause rest on entirely\ndifferent grounds from those hitherto discussed : we refer to the\napparitions seen in so-called \" haunted \" houses. Speaking gene\nrally, there are two main lines of argument available in favour of a\nsupernormal origin in these cases. The first relies on the fact that\napparitions are seen in the same place by two or more persons quite\nindependently\u2014each percipient being, at the time of his experience,\nunaware that any similar phenomenon had occurred in that locality.\nNow, considering that hallucinations sometimes occur during morbid\nphysical conditions, and that they can easily be induced in tbe\nhypnotic state, we clearly ought to assume that a hallucination is\nsubjective, unless there is some special ground for thinking otherwise.\nThe present collection shows further that hallucinations which there\nis no ground for regarding as other than subjective are not very\nuncommon phenomena. Hence the mere fact of apparitions being\nseen in the same place by two persons independently is far from being\na conclusive proof of the supernormal origin of the apparitions.1 But\nthe force of the evidence of course increases as the number of inde\npendent percipients increases, especially if they have had no hallu\ncinations in other places, or only veridical hallucinations ; while any\nresemblances between the figures seen also add to the evidence.\nThe second line of argument connects the apparitions with some\nformer inhabitant of the place, proceeding on the basis of facts (e.g.,\ndetails of resemblance) unknown to the percipient at the time of the\nhallucination.\nIn attempting to estimate the force of these arguments, we have to\ntake into account, with regard to alleged resemblances between the\napparitions seen by independent percipients, the uncertainty of compari\nsons founded on mere descriptions ; the frequent pre-conception that\nthe apparitions represent the same person, and the consequent tendency\nto emphasise unduly any resemblances that there may be ; and the\npossibility of chance resemblances, unless the details relied on are of a\nvery unusual kind. The same difficulties arise in attempting to judge\n1 Especially if, as often happens, the two percipients belong to the same family,\nsince, as we have said above (see pp. 154-9), there is some reason to think that\nhallucinations run in families.\n\fXVI.] 339\nLocal Apparitions.\nof alleged resemblances between the apparition and any given\ndeceased person ; and in such cases, we also have to estimate the chance\nthat an apparition seen in any house will resemble in some degree some\nprevious inhabitant of the house. And, since the most primitive, and\nstill the most widely spread and deeply rooted, conception of appari\ntions is that they represent dead persons, any accidental resemblance\nis likely to be unconsciously exaggerated ; and resemblances which did\nnot really exist are likely to be read back into the experiences after\nwards. Further, on account of the peculiar kind of interest attaching\nto this class of apparitions in the minds of many persons, there is\na special probability of accretions to the original narrative, and\nsecond-hand evidence on any point is therefore liable to be specially\nuntrustworthy.1\nIn view of these considerations, the reader will not be surprised\nto learn that in many of the cases of unrecognised apparitions reported\nto us in the Census which were said to be connected with \" haunts,\"\nthe reasons alleged for regarding the experience as other than sub\njective seem to us entirely inadequate. When out of the cases\nreported we select for special consideration those which in our\nopinion afford any primdfacie evidence of a supernormal origin, we find\nthat they amount to some thirty in number : of these we give below the\nbest authenticated. In 15 out of the 30 cases, the apparitions\u2014which\nwere in all cases unrecognised\u2014were not associated by the percipient\nwith any particular deceased person. In the other 1 5 cases, the appari\ntion was supposed to represent some dead person, whom the percipient\nhad not known. The two cases in which the evidence for the connec\ntion is perhaps the strongest happen to have been already published\"\nin the Proceedings S.P.R.,\u2014one as the \" Record of a Haunted House \"\n(Vol. VIII., p. 311) ; the other as G. 188 (Vol. VI., p. 270). In both\nthese cases, not only was there first-hand evidence of a certain degree\nof resemblance between the figures seen and the persons in question,\nbut also similar figures were seen by several different percipients in\ndependently. In a third case, No. 33. 25 (see Proceedings S P.R.,\nVol. V., p. 462), the evidence for identification is weaker, and, as far\nas we know, the apparition was only seen once ; but it was seen in a\nroom in which the percipient afterwards heard that a man had died\nabout a year before.\nTwo out of the thirty cases have been quoted in previous chapters,\nnamely, No. 483. 10 (see p. 157), and No. 588. 22 (see p. 101). In the\nfirst of these, the apparition was supposed to represent a former\ninhabitant of the house ; but the evidence for this rests on remote\n1 Compare, for instance, the remote with the first-hand versions of the case No.\n267. 1, given below (see p. 358-362).\nZ 2\n\f340 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\ntestimony, and the same testimony states that this former inhabitant\nhimself used to see an apparition which he did not recognise, in the\nsame house. Tn the second case, the narrative sent us shows that the\napparition was not seen by the two servants independently.\nBefore proceeding to discuss the other cases individually, we may\nrefer to some general characteristics of the class which it will be\nnecessary to bear in mind.\nNoises in \" Haunted \" Houses.\nOne of the most commonly reported features in cases of \"haunted\"\nhouses,\u2014as has been remarked in articles on the subject previously\npublished in our Proceedings, and is borne out by the cases in the\npresent Census,\u2014is the frequent occurrence of alarming and un\naccountable noises in the house. In many cases, the reputation of the\nhouse as \" haunted \" rests on these noises alone, and in many others, it is\nthe noises that attract most attention, while the seeing of an apparition\nby one or more persons in the house seems a merely subsidiary\nphenomenon ; for instance, in the well-known story of the \"Willington\nMill (see Journal S.P.R., Vol. V., pp. 331-352).\nWe gave reasons in Chapter X. (p. 180) for doubting whether noises\nof this kind are hallucinatory. But in addition to what was there\nsaid, it is important to bear in mind that auditory illusions\u2014\nespecially with regard to the localisation of sounds\u2014are much\nmore possible and frequent than analogous visual illusions. Fur\nther, the noises in question are generally, though not invariably,\nreported to be heard at night, when mistakes are especially\nliable to occur, because the real sounds which are audible at night are\noften comparatively unfamiliar, while the impressions derived from\nthem cannot be corrected by the sense of sight. And in many cases\nthe hearers are in a state of alarm and expectancy, which would tend\nto make them misinterpret their impressions of ordinary sounds.\nAt the same time, the sounds described are sometimes such that\nit is difficult to conceive of any ordinary explanation of them which\nwould not have been discovered by the persons living in the house and\nconstantly looking out for some such explanation.1\n1 There are also a few cases where it is reported that the sounds indicate some\nintelligence, e.g., when raps on the wall reply to spoken or mental questions. We\nhave, however, only one case approaching this kind among those reported in the\nCensus ; here it is merely stated that the noises became more violent when the\nhearer addressed remarks to the supposed unseen intelligence ; but we have been\nunable to obtain confirmation of this statement, and nuch an effect is one which\nit would undeniably be very easy for a person who was strongly impressed with the\nphenomena to imagine.\n\fXVI.] 341\nLocal Apparitions.\n\u2022Supposing, however, that these noises are in some cases real\nexternal sounds misinterpreted, it seems probable that they may lead to\nthe apparitions being seen, through raising expectancy in the hearers. In\nChapter X. (pp. 178-180) we have given some evidence that real noises do\noccasionally have such an effect; and in many of the oases of \" haunted \"\nhouses, it is stated that the noises had been constantly heard and talked\nover before any apparition was seen. The following is an instance :\u2014\n(284. 15.) From Miss K. B.\nMay 30th, 181K).\n\" The circumstances I am aK)ut to relate occurred during two visits that\nI paid to Ireland in the months of August and September, 1880 and 1881.\nThe house in which I stayed was really an old barracks, long disused, very\nold-fashioned, and surrounded by a high wall ; in fact, I am told it was built\nduring the time of Cromwell as a stronghold for his men.\n\" The only inhabitants of this barracks were Captain C (a retired otficer\nwho was in charge of the place), Mrs. C, three daughters and two servants.\nThey occupied the central part of the building, the mess room being their\ndrawing-room. The bedrooms are very lofty, and some are connected one\nwith the other by doors leading into each other. The room I occupied was\none adjoining two others, and those were occupied by the three daughters\nof Captain C, named E., G., and L. The first recollection I have of any\nthing strange about the house is that each night I was awakened at about\n3 o'clock a.m. (judging the time from the dawn which followed) by a\ntremendous noise apparently in the next suite of rooms, which were empty,\nand it sounded as if some huge iron boxes and other heavy things were\nbeing thrown about with great force. This continued for about half-an-hour,\nwhen in the room underneath (the kitchen) I heard the fire being violently\npoked about and raked for some minutes, immediately followed by a most\nterrible and distressing coughing of a man, very loud and violent. It\nseemed as if the exertion had brought on a paroxysm which he could not\nstop. I should here say that in large houses in Kilkenny the fires are not\nlighted every day, as the Kilkenny coal has the property of burning very\nslowly without name, and it is only necessary to make it up every night\nabout 11 o'clock, and in the morning it is still clear and bright. I had heard\nabout this coal, and I remember wondering why it was necessary for Captain\nC. to get up in the middle of the night to stir it so violently, and the horrid\nnoises perplexed me ; but as I am not a nervous subject I forgot all about it\ntill the next night, when the very same thing occurred, and this time I felt\na great desire to awaken the girls in the next rooms, but did not like to.\n\"The next day I said to E. 'E., I hear such strange noises every night,\nare any people in the adjoining part of the building ? ' She turned very\npale, and looking earnestly at me, said, ' Oh, K., I am so sorry you heard, I\nhoped no one but myself heard it. I would have given worlds to have spoken\nto you last night, but dared not move or speak ' I was bathed in perspira\ntion with terror.'\n\" I laughed at her and said, ' Why, E., one would think to see you, you\nthought it was ghosts.' She said, \" Oh, I don't think, but hioir, and it is so\n\f342 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\ndreadful, this goes on night after night,' and when she went on to tell me\nthat the place was said to be haunted, and told me a lot of weird things that\nhad been seen and heard. My answer to this was a disdainful laugh, and I\nsaid, ' Oh , you Irish people are full of superstition ; you think every\nthing that happens is supernatural.' After this the subject was not men\ntioned again, and I did not feel a bit scared when the same things went on\nat night during the rest of my week's visit. I went home, forgetting all\nabout it till the following year, when I again visited my friends and spent\nsix weeks there.\n\"This time there were two other visitors besides myself, a Colonel and\nMrs. C. They occupied the tri-une room, where I had been before, and to\nme was allotted a huge room on the top of the house with a long corridor\nleading to it. The girls were in a large room opposite mine.\n\" I don't remember once thinking of the strange occurrences of the\nformer visit till one morning when 1 was awakened about 4 o'clock (I should\nthink) by a very noisy martial footstep ascending the stairs, and then march\ning quickly up and down the corridor outside my room. Then suddenly the\nmost violent coughing took place that I ever heard, which continued for\nsome time (it seemed ages to me) while the quick heavy step continued its\nvigorous march. At last the footsteps faded away in the distance, and I\nthen recalled to mind the very same coughing after exertion last year.\n\" At breakfast that morning I said, 'Oh, Captain C, what a horrible\ncough you have. ' He looked surprised and answered, ' I a cough ? why I\nhaven't a bit of one 1 ' I then turned to Colonel C. and said, ' Was it you,\nColonel, who were making such a noise at 4 o'clock this morning ? ' He said,\n' Faith, you won't catch me prowling about at such unearthly hours ! and I\nhaven't the shadow of a cough.' I noticed that all the C. family looked\nuncomfortable, and nothing more was said till E. came to me in a mast\nmysterious manner with tears in her eyes and said, ' Oh, K., please don't say\nanother word about that dreadful coughing ; we all hear it often, and\nespecially when anything dreadful is going to happen. Mother can't bear to\nhear it mentioned, and we don't want L. to hear it mentioned, she is so\ndelicate and easily upset ! ' After this I thought, come what will, I'll say-\nnothing more, but I would give a good deal to fathom it all !\n\" Some nights after we had been having a dance (indeed we did this\nmost nights), but on this particular evening when I went up to bed, the moon\nwas shining so brilliantly that I was able to read my Bible by its light, and I\nleft the Bible open on the window-sill, which was a very high one and on\nwhich I sat to read, having had to climb the washstand to reach it. The\nblinds were not drawn, as I liked the light, and I soon got to bed and fell\nfast asleep. I could not have been long asleep when I was suddenly-\nawakened by a strange feeling that some one was in the room. I opened\nmy eyes and turned round, and opposite me on the window-sill where I had\nbeen sitting before going to bed, I saw in the moonlight (which was still very\nbright, though not shining direct into the room) a long, very thin, very dark\nblack figure bending over the Bible and apparently earnestly scanning the\npage. It took only a second to see this, but, as if my movement disturbed the\nfigure, it suddenly darted up, jumped off the window-ledge, on to the wash-\nstand, and thence to the ground, and flitted quickly across the room,which was\n\fXVI.] 343\nLocal Apparitions.\nvery large, and contained a large round table at the other end on which were\na lot of bangles and other silver ornaments. I tried to see where the figure\nwas, but I could only hear a slight jingle as if some one were feeling quietly\nmy bangles and rings. I thought it might be a servant walking in her sleep,\nor perhaps some one to steal my jewelry. I sat up and looked hard over in\nthe corner of the room, but could see nothing. I then determined to wait\ntill the figure should go out of the room, which could not be done without\nmy seeing it pass in the light of the window, but, although I did not take\nmy eyes off the spot till daylight fairly set in, I saw nothing further, and am\nconvinced that nothing and no one left the room.\nIn the morning G. C. brought my breakfast to me in bed, as she said I\nmust be tired after our dancing, and indeed I was tired, but not from\ndancing ! When she came I said ' G., I have seen your ghost at last '. ' She\nsaid not a word but rushed out of the room.\n\" When I next saw her I said ' G., you don't believe what I told you\nabout the ghost, but it's true '. ' and then I related to her the events of the\nnight. She said, ' Oh, yes, indeed I only believe it too well ! that is just\nwhat dear H. saw before he died ! ' (H. was her brother who died of\nconsumption, aged 24.) I said, 'I hope you don't mean I am going to die,'\nand she said ' something always happens after that appears.' I may as well\nadd here that nothing dreadful <\/\/(\/ happen. I heard afterwards that a\nColonel had cut his throat in that very room many years before, and that\nthe place has ever since been haunted.\"\nMiss B. had had one other hallucination about three years previously.\nShe was awakened by feeling the bed clothes pulled off her. She sat up to\nreplace them, and then saw an apparition of her uncle walk into the room.\nHe was at the time seriously ill in the same house, his wife watching by\nhim, and he died shortly after.\nThe next case is an interesting example of the gradual development\nof the phenomena,\u2014the sounds heard increasing in violence, while the\nvague figure first seen took by degrees a more and more definite form,\napproximating to the legendary one, but only apparently after the\npercipient had become familiar with the legend. A figure with a some\nwhat similar costume was, however, also seen by a visitor who had not\nheard of it beforehand.\n(114. 6.) From Miss L. H.\n[We give an abstract of Miss H.'s account, which was written in 1891.]\nIn January, 1873, Miss H. and her aunt, sleeping together, saw their bed\nroom door opened and a curious pale light streaming in. The door shut as\nMiss H.got up,and she found it dark outside and no one there. Soon theybegan\nto hear noises, doors opening, footsteps,etc., at night, and heard that the house\nwas reputed to be \"haunted.\" Miss H. then began to feel touches when\nshe was in bed, and the bed shaken,etc.,and the noises continued. One night\nshe saw in the moonlight a figure burst through a closed door and rush past\nher bed to the window ; she heard the sweep of garments as it went by.\nThe noises constantly increased, and \"by degrees,\" she writes,\"! used to see\n\f344 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\na figure, always the same, of a man in a military cloak of the old style,\nseeming to keep a hand over its eyes.\" By this time she had heard that the\nhouse was supposed to be \" haunted \" by its late owner, a Waterloo officer,\nwho had built it and died there. Miss H.'s aunt had seen a hand round her\nbed-curtains, and felt her own hands touched, and a lady, Miss D., staying\nin the house, saw a figure twice at night ; though, Miss H. states, \"we never\nprepared our visitors at all for it, and some were not visited.\" Miss H. went\non living at the house afterher aunt's death in 1882 until 1886, the noises, etc.\ncontinuing to trouble all the inmates at intervals during the whole time.\nIn an interview with Mr. Myers, Miss H. informed him that she had\nhad two other experiences ; she saw an apparition of her mother at the time\nof the latter's death, 1 and an apparition of her aunt soon after her death.\nMiss D. writes :- AprU im lg92\n\" During the month of August, 1881, 1 was visiting Miss H., at . After\na few nights, I retired to my room as usual, and when I had been in bed an\nhour or so, a cloaked figure came into the room, having previously opened\n(very quietly) the door. I wish to state emphatically that this is no imagina\ntion, nor a dream. 1 was wide awake and in good health. The figure came\nclose to the bed, and glided away towards the window, passing the foot of the\nbed, and disappeared. A few nights after, the same thing occurred, except\nthat the figure on entering the room came quite up to the bed, and gently\nstroked my forehead, smoothing the hair from it.\n\" I have never before or since seen anything of a similar nature.\"\nIn the next case, several percipients were concerned ; the one who\ngives the principal first-hand account (Miss H. M.) saw two distinctly\ndifferent figures, each several times, and it does not seem clear that\neither of them had any particular resemblance to the figures seen by\nthe other witnesses, who were probably familiar with the reputation of\nthe house. It is an interesting feature in the case that, on two occa\nsions, the two percipients concerned had different but corresponding\npercepts at the same time. On the first occasion, both saw the\ndoor open and shut, while one saw the ghost walk in ; and on the\nsecond occasion, one felt a touch on his arm, while the other saw the\nghost touching him. The evidence, however, for this last incident is\nonly at second-hand, and of the first it must be observed that the pos\nsibility of the door having been opened by ordinary means does not\nseem to be excluded.\n(264. 23.) From Miss E. L. T.\nJune 7th. 1890.\n\" In March, 1889, 1 was staying in a house in , and several\ntimes had a strong impression that some one invisible was in the\nThis occurred in childhood, and no corroboration is now obtainable. We did not,\ntherefore, think it worth while to press for a first-hand account, and the case, conse\nquently, in not included in the first-hand death-coincidences discussed in Chapters\nXI and XIII.\n\fXVI.] 345\nLocal Apparitions.\nroom. At the same time it was usually seen by one person, sometimes by\ntwo. On one occasion I saw the door open, when a lady who was with me\nsaw a figure (grey) come in and vanish. The door was a very heavy one,\nand we remarked that there was no wind at the time. I was singing,\nbetween 12 and 1 o'clock (midday). I was in my usual health ; no grief or\nanxiety; age 26. [The] lady with me was playing my accompaniment on the\npiano, which was a grand. We were facing down a long room, at the other\nend of which was the door. We finished the song, though much startled.\nThen I asked my friend if she had seen anything. She said she had seen\nthe grey figure come in, walk up to a writing table, and vanish.\n' ' Several times in that room, generally in the morning, I had the impression\nof someone having come into the room, nearly always while music was going\non ; sometimes in other rooms at night. Severaltimesl haveheardmysterious\nmusic by day and night from the garden. Once I was sitting at the writing\ntable (where the ghost has been seen to vanish), when I suddenly felt a\nfearful coldness come over me, which lasted a few seconds ; then I suddenly\nfelt quite warm again.\"\nThe experiences of the other percipients in this case are described as\nfollows by Miss T.'s sister, who was with her on the same visit. Her\naccount was written not later than 1892.\n\" When first we visited , no one had ever seen a ghost there, or\nsuspected the place of being haunted in any way. It was in January, 1889,\nthat curious things first began to happen. There was a large party in the\nhouse, the M. 's themselves [the owners of the house], etc. One night E. [the\nwriter of the above account] could not sleep, and about 3 o'clock she heard\nthree loud knocks on the wall at the side of her bed. The knocks had a\npeculiarly metallic sound, and she tried several experiments the next day\nto get the same sound, but could not produce it.\n\" The next morning, G. M. came down to breakfast and said H. M. [her\nsister] was not coming down. She was very tired, having seen a ghost ! Her\nstory was : she was awakened by seeing a light, then she saw the figure of a\nman, with his head bent, as if reading a book. The light was strong enough for\nher to see G. 's bed distinctly. The light and the man faded away, andH. never\nsaw the same figure again, but she afterwards very frequently saw the figure\nof a grey lady in the drawing-room. It usually came in by the door, and\nvanished in front of the looking-glass, though it occasionally came into the\nmiddle of the room. It appeared both by daylight and candlelight, most\nfrequently about 12 mid-day, and generally came when music was going on.\nMr. H. T. [one of the visitors] saw the same figure on one occasion in the\ndrawing-room. And another day when tea was going on in the hall, he\nfelt a touch ou his arm. He saw nothing, but was much frightened. He\nafterwards asked H. if she had seen the ghost that day. She said, ' Yes, I\nsaw it touch you on the arm.' The ghost was seen several times that year,\nand very mysterious noises were heard at night.\n\"In the March of that year\u20141889\u2014E. T. was again at , and\nshe was very often aware of the presence of the ghost, and, on asking H.\nafterwards, found that she had invariably seen it at the time. They agreed\nthat they would never say anything at the time, but would find out after if\nwhat they had seen and felt had occurred at the same time. One day, E. was\n\f346 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nsinging, H. playing her accompaniment. It was between 12 and 1. The\ndoor of the room (a large and heavy one) opened, and H. saw the ghost walk\nin. E. did not see it, she only saw the door open and shut, but she felt it\nwas thore, and it required some courage to finish the song.\n\" Miss G. H. was at that same March. She, like the rest of the\nparty, was greatly disturbed by the noises in the night. One night she was\nbrushing her hair before the looking-gLiss, when she saw a ghost standing\nbehind her. The door was open. It went out of the room when she turned\nround, and she followed it down the passage till it disappeared.\n\" Miss D. is said to have seen the ghost once, and the butler saw it cross\ning the grass towards the chapel one evening when hymns were being sung\nin there. Mysterious music has been heard there. E. T. heard it twice.\nMiss G. H. heard it, and three maids heard it once at night.\n\" The ghost was seen and noises were heard in 1890 and 1891, but at leas\nand less frequent intervals. I was in the drawing-room once when the ghost\nwas seen, but I did not feel it then.\"\nAmong the other witnesses referred to, Miss H. M. is the only one from\nwhom we have been able to obtain a first-hand account. She writes as\nfollows :\u2014\nFebruary 24fA, 1890.\n\" [I] saw a white figure standing at the foot of my sister's bed on January\n13th, 1889, at 4.40 a.m. I have also seen the same figure twice during the\nsummer. I have been looking out of the window and [have] seen it standing\nin the garden. I often used to see a grey figure come in at the drawing-roouv\ndoor and vanish, generally between 12 and 1 in the daytime, and always\nwhen music has been going on. No one else has seen it, but several people\nhave felt it.\n\" When the white figure first appeared, I was in bed\u2014the other times\nlooking out of the window. I am generally playing when I see the grey\nfigure, or sitting in the room while others are playing or singing. My age\nwas 21 when I first saw them. I am now 22.\n\" The grey figure appears to have no features. The white one has a very\ngood profile, but I cannot recognise it. When the white figure appeared in\nthe garden, amongst five of us who were looking, only one, a boy of 19, saw it\nbesides myself. People havefelt the grey figure, but never seen it. I have\nnot seen either since last September.\"\nThe next case, though remote, is interesting, because the ap\nparition was seen in the first instance collectively, and when none\nof the percipients were in any condition of expectancy or alarm about\nit. Though noises formed part of the phenomena, they were not heard\nuntil after the apparition had been seen. The only living witnesses\nwere children at the time, but their recollection of the incidents seems\nto be clear.\n(679. 2.) From Mrs. Yearsley.\nChalk Hill House, Kingsbury, N.W., December 2nd, 1891.\n\" I saw a ghost of a woman standing in a recess by the stairs. I was\ncoming downstairs, having been sent by my mother to take some work to her\n\fXVI.] 347\nLocal Apparitions.\nbedroom. It was, as nearly as I can remember, when I was six years of age.\nIt was about 4\u20144.30 in the afternoon, at No. 2, Kent-villas, Asylum-road,\nPeckham. The apparition, as far as I could see, looked simply like the\nfigure of a woman with a shawl over her head, and at first I took her for one\nof the maid-servants, but she was in the kitchen at the time. No [other\npersons were present], but others of the family saw a similar apparition at\ndifferent times. I myself saw it on two occasions ; [the second] time I saw\nit pass across a room as I passed by the open door of that room.\n\" The above occurred in either 1853 or 1854. T t, v..m..v \"\nThe following account was contained in a letter to the collector, Mrs.\nYearsley's son, from her sister, Mrs. Compton :\u2014\n93, East Dulwich Grove, S.E., JWy 0th [1892].\n\"The haunted house we lived in for over three years still stands, and\nwas let the last time I passed it, some months ago. The address used to be\nNo. 2, Kent Villas, Asylum Road, Peckham. No doubt that is altered now.\n\" The first I ever saw of the ghost,\u2014 or old woman, as we children always\ncalled it,\u2014was the very day we moved into the house. The men were putting\ndown carpets, etc., and your mother and I and George and Maggie were\nsent to play upstairs to be out of the way. We chose the top staircase\nleading to the upper bedrooms. This staircase had a small dark lumber\nroom underneath it, the door of which was almost exactly opposite my\nmother's bedroom. We had been playing for nearly an hour when we saw\nwhat looked like a tall, thin woman, with a plaid shawl of a red and white\npattern put over her head and a little over one side of her face, come slowly\ndown the stairs from the upper front bedroom ; her dress rustled behind\nher. We all drew back against the wall, while she passed us and went down\nthe stairs, turned a little to the right, and disappeared into the lumber\nroom. We were all dreadfully frightened, and flew, and some fell, down the\nstairs to tell what we had seen. My mother was very angry, and said we had\nbeen playing at ghosts till we imagined we had seen one, and we were all\nsent back again. We sat huddled together till called to bed. All this took\nplace on a bright summer afternoon. The very next Sunday we were dining\nin the breakfast-room, and in the middle of dinner we heard the lateh\nbfted of the half-glass door leading to the garden. Several of us looked up\nand saw the door open, and the shadwo of some one go quickly up the stairs.\nMy father called two of the boys, saying, ' some one has got into the\nhouse.' They took heavy sticks, and one stood in the hall, so that no one\ncould pass without being seen, and the others searched every corner of the\nhouse and saw nothing.\n\" My eldest brother often came home late from the Stock Exchange\non account nights, and mother always let him in, to see that he was\nall right. The first time he was late in that house, he came down\nstairs again in half-an hour to know if any of the children were ill, as ;he\ndeclared my mother, as he supposed it to be, had gone up and entered his\nroom, sighing deeply, and then had gone into the children's room, and had\nleft his door and the children's wide open.\n\"The noises in the house were at times almost unbearable\u2014exactly as\nthough half-a-ton of coals had been shot down the stairs. Mother never\n\f348 Report on the Census of Hall.wcination8i [chap.\nactually saw the old woman, though she constantly followed the sound of the\nfootsteps up the stairs to try and discover what it could be; and once, while\nsitting up late, reading in front of a long glass on her dressing table, she\nheard it come downstairs, and made up her mind she would look ; but\ndirectly the door began to open she covered her face, and distinctly heard\nit come all round the room and go out, leaving the door open.\n\" One afternoon, I was sent upstairs to the children's bedroom. After\nfinding what I wanted I came down the top flight of stairs, and right in front of\nme stood the old woman in the doorway of mother's bedroom. I stood, too\nfrightened to move, especially as I had to pass her to reach the lower staircase.\nIf I saw her face now, after all these years, I should know it. The hair was\nvery dark and smooth ; the one eye not covered by the shawl was turned up,\nand the face like death. It had the look I have since seen on the faces of the\ndead. How long I stood I don't know\u2014it seemed hours. At last I made a\ndesperate effort and passed it, and with one bound was downstairs, and\nI fell at the parlour door. I was unable to move, and they dragged me in\nand well scolded me, and 1 was forbidden to speak of it to the others. An\nhour afterwards your mother was sent up for something, and as she was a\nlong time gone, mother called to her to come at once, and when she did, she\nsaid cook was standing at the lumber room door with a shawl over her head,\nand she had been trying to make her speak, but she was too cross. At last\nwe got quite used to seeing the thing about the house, although, for my part,\nI lived in dread of it. I saw it constantly ; it used to come into my room\nand stand by my bed, but 1 don't remember seeing it once when it was\nquite dark. The noises got too dreadful, and we hunted for another house,\nalthough my father hesitated about taking the one we all fixed upon ; but\nthe old woman settled the question, for father having gone to bed early with\none of his favourite bilious attacks, he heard some one coming, and in walked\nthe old woman, which so frightened him that he was up by 7 o'clock next\nmorning, and off to take the new house.\n\" After all the furniture had gone, and your mother and I and Magnie\nwere sleeping in beds on the floor, we were all talking and telling fairy\ntales, when Mag suddenly dived under the clothes. We soon knew the\nreason; at the very foot of our bed stood the old woman, and your aunt had\nseen it first. The people who took the house from us left very shortly, as\nthey said they could get no rest for awful noises. How it has fared since,\nI don't know. I fear I have a sort of faculty for uncanny tiiings (f), as the\nold woman is not the only odd thing I have seen ; and I always know when\ntrouble or death is coming to any member of the family\u2014 I wish I did not.\"\nMrs. Yearsley adds :\u2014\nJnly 31st. 1892.\n\" I have read my sister's (Mrs. Compton) description of the events\nwhich took place at 2, Kent-villas, Asylum-road, Peckham, in 1853-4. It\nperfectly describes my experiences as well as hers, and I do not think there\nis anything I can add.\n\" I perfectly remember the occasion of our sitting at a meal, and seeing\nthe shadow as of a person going up the stairs from the half glass door from\nthe garden. I also can distinctly remember meeting the apparition at\nthe top of the stairs and speaking to it, and then feeling very frightened.\n\fXVI.] 349\nLocal Apparitions.\nand going downstairs as quickly as possible, and my mother calling to the\nservants directly, thinking one of them might have been upstairs, and that\nI might have imagined I had seen this phantom, though really guessing what\nI had seen. At that time I was about 6 to 7 years of age, and my sister,\nMrs. Compton, 8or9J years. \u201ej fi Yearslby.\"\nMrs. Yearsley's other brother and sister mentioned in the account are\nno longer living. Another surviving brother does not recollect the incidents\nclearly enough to give an account.\nRecognised Local Ap1xiritions.\nAs said above, the great majority of apparitions that seem to be\nassociated with special places are unrecognised. We have, however,\nthree cases in the Census where an apparition of a dead person known\nto the percipients is believed to have been seen by more than one person\nindependently in the same place.\nIn the first case, the figure was seen in the room in which the\nperson it was thought to represent had died ; but it was only recognised\nby one of the percipients after the other had seen an unrecognised\nfigure in the same room.\n(570. 4.) From Mrs. L. F.\nJanuary 24th, 1892.\n\" In the bedroom where I was sleeping I saw my grandmother. She\nwas in her night-dress and cap, and walked from one side of the fire place\nto the other, and then vanished. The room was the one she died in. I was\nalone in bed. I was not grown up at the time, and don't remember what age\nI was, or any other particulars as regarding my health. My grandmother\n[had lived] in the house with me, but I don't remember how long after her\ndeath it was that I saw her. [I have] never [had any other such experience.]\"\nThe following account of a somewhat similar experience in the same room\nis from Mrs. F.'s step-sister :\u2014\n(570. 5.) From Miss A. C.\nJanuary 24th, 1892.\nu In the autumn of 1874 I saw one night in the room I was sleeping [in]\nan old woman come in and walk to the chair beside my bed ; it was in my\nown home, and the room the one she died in some years before.\n\" I was in bed ; I do not remember what was my state of health. I was\nabout 17 years old. I did not recognise ever having seen the old woman\nbefore. I was sleeping with some one at the time [who was], I think, asleep.\nI have never seen any one since.\"\nIn reply to our request for further particulars, Miss C. writes :\u2014\nMarch 1st [1892]\n\" As well as I can remember, the person had on a white cap like an old\nwoman's night-cap. I did not recognise ever having seen her before. Some\ntime before, Mrs. F.'s grandmother died in that same room, and she was the\n\f350 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nperson Mrs. F. saw, after I had seen the other apparition. I had never\nheard the room was haunted or of any one having been seen in it since.\"\nIn the next case, we are not expressly told whether the person\nrepresented by the apparition had any connection with the place in\nwhich it was seen ; but the contrary seems to be implied. On the\nother hand, in the case of the second apparition seen by Miss L. H.,\nthe association seems to have been a local rather than a personal one.\nThe frequent recurrence of both hallucinations in Miss H.'s experience\nis to be noted ; and also the indication of a hereditary tendency to\nhallucinations of the kind, since they were experienced by Mrs. H. and\ntwo of her children. But heredity does not appear to be a sufficient\nexplanation of the phenomena, as there is some evidence that both\napparitions were also seen independently by other persons.\n(698. 24.) From Mrs. H. H.\nMarch 8th, 1892.\n\" I saw in 1872, in the month of December, an old gentleman, apparently\nan invalid, crossing a room in a house in , where I was then lodging. As\nnear as I can remember, the hours were 12 p.m., 1 p.m., and 8 p.m. The\nonly thing I observed at the time was that he looked very ill, and wore a\nlong brown Turkish dressing-gown with big tassels. On three occasions I\nhad this experience. Twice on entering the room I saw it, and on one\noccasion it appeared while I was at lunch. I was in very good health, and\nnot suffering from grief or anxiety. I was 51 years of age. Many years\nbefore I was in the habit of seeing the gentleman almost daily. My little\nson and his nurse [were present, and] all saw him distinctly, as did my\ndaughter, on the second time of his appearing.\"\nFrom the following statement, received from Miss L. H., the daughter\nreferred to in Mrs. H.'s account, it does not seem clear that the apparition\nwas ever seen collectively, as Mrs. H. appears to imply, but the evidence\ngoes to show that a similar apparition was seen independently by several\ndifferent persons, without any communication with one another on the\nsubject.\nJune 17th, 1892.\n\"L. H. was the daughter who saw the old gentleman in the dressing-\ngown, spoken of by her mother, Mrs. H. , but the son spoken of was only a\nlittle child at the time and was laughed out of the idea that he had seen any\none, at the time ; and when the lodgings were given up, no reference to\nthe apparition was ever made before him, as he was both delicate and\nnervous. The old nurse spoken of died in November, 1873, but she never\ndoubted having seen it. Till Mrs. H.'s little son spoke of having seen 'an old\nman,' neither Mrs. H., L. H., nor the nurse spoke to each other about it,\nas naturally each one thought it could only be imagination. The person seen\nwas known in life to all but H. H . (the little boy) ; he was indistinctly\nremembered by L. H. as an old man who was always ill ; but both the\nnurse and Mrs. H. knew him well.\"\n\fXVI.] 351\nLocal Apparitions.\nIn reply to further enquiries, Miss H. writes :\u2014\nAugust 31st. 1893.\n\" I will endeavour to give you all the details I remember of the apparition\nseen by me in 1872. I was not sleeping in the house in which my mother\nwas lodging, but I used to go in and out several times during the day. The\nsitting-room was an upstairs room ; one window looked into the street, and\nthe other exactly opposite it into the garden. The figure used to glide quite\nsuddenly between the fireplace towards the garden window. Whilst I was\nwatching it, it apparently melted. I never really saw the disappearing ;\none moment it was there, the next, I used to think it was all rubbish, and\nI must have let my eyes deceive me.\n\" 1 am not quite sure how long my mother was in the house, for I was\nst a boarding-school in the town ; but I know the first time I saw the\napparition was December 13th. I can fix the date, as I was home for two\ndays for my sister's wedding, which took place the day before. It must have\nbeen some time between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m., as I was lunching with friends\nthat day and should not have been in the house after 1 o'clock. After that\none occasion I did not see any more of it till my holidays began, say about\nDecember 20th, and I left on January 14th ; but between these two dates I\nconstantly saw it, nearly always by daylight ; though once I remember\nseeing it exceedingly distinctly by firelight. I remember I was alone on that\noccasion, and it stayed long enough for me to notice [that] the girdle of the\ndressing-gown it appeared to be wearing had a big upright loop to it.\n' ' I had no idea that any one else saw it till some time afterwards, except\nmy brother, who was very little then, and he had declared several times he\nsaw an old man in the corner ; but he was very delicate and nervous, and\nthey used to tell him it was the shadow of a tree waving about\u2014he was so easily\nfrightened. I used not to say anything, for we are a very matter-of-fact\nfamily, and I knew I should be unmercifully chaffed, if I had said anything\nto my brothers and sisters (of whom I had several). Our old nurse did not\ntell my mother or me anything about it till she was out of the house, and\nmy mother was equally silent. I think they were both afraid of alarming\nus ; though there was nothing to alarm any one in the apparition. It was a\nvery gentle, mild-faced old man, and not one bit like a story-book ghost.\n\" I should think it was about September, 1873, that I first heard it had\nbeen seen by my mother, and a little later than that my nurse told me she\ntoo had seen it.\n\" They have been with me in the room when I have seen it, but whether\nthey saw it at the same time, of course I cannot tell. You see, we never\nthought any one else would be interested in it.\n\" There was a distinct feeling of some strange personality, so to speak,\nin the room, that involuntarily used to turn my head to that part of the\nroom each time I saw the apparition. I never used to look for it, but when\nit was there, I knew it ; and sometimes I used not then to turn round, if I was\nvery much interested in what I was doing. I got accustomed to it ; and\nI don't think I was ever too well pleased at having to force myself\ninto a belief in such things. I hardly ever speak of my own experiences, for\nit is, I find, only about one person in a hundred who gives one credit for\ntelling nothing but the honest truth.\"\n\f352 Report on the Census of Hallucination*. [chap\nMiss H. has had another somewhat similar series of experiences, which\nshe thus describes :\u2014\nMarch 8th, 1892.\n\" I have seen on several occasions the figure of an old man, always in the\nhouse, though not in the same place in the house. The hours of appearance\nhave varied, but it has oftenest been broad daylight. The dates have been\nfrom 1874 to the present year. I was occupied in no particular way. I was.\nin perfect health on most of the occasions, and had neither grief nor anxiety.\nWhen I first saw it I was eighteen. I never saw the person in life. Some\ntimes the figure has been resting in an armchair, sometimes it appears to\nhave come in from a ride. No one has been with me at the time, though I\nhave heard others speak of the same figure appearing to them. 1 have never\ntried to count how often I have seen it, but it may be about three or our\ntimes in a year. The old man has very bright blue eyes and a good deal of\ncolour ; he is always dressed in white riding breeches and black coat.\"\nIn answer to questions, Miss H. writes :\u2014\n\"To the best of L. H.'s knowledge the figure was seen quite inde\npendently, no one person having told another it was to be seen, or that he or\nshe had seen it. There was no special reason for connecting it with any\ndeceased person at the time it was first seen by L. H., although from photo\ngraphs and a picture afterwards seen, she had no doubt as to its identity.\nL. H. is sorry not to be able to give any particulars as to any fixed dates\nor occasions of its appearances, for they are most erratic,\u2014coming sometimes\nfrequently and close together, and then not again for months ; but they\nare much more usual in daylight than at any other time.\"\nMiss II. adds later :\u2014\nAvgnst 31i<, 1893\n\" I have seen [the apparition] once or twice within the last four months,\nbut I have not heard of anyone else having seen it within that time.\"\nMrs H., being an invalid, was unable to receive visitors, so that we have\nnot had an opportunity of a personal interview with her or Miss H.\nIn the third and last case of this kind, it is doubtful whether\nthe recognition of the figure was at all clearly made out until the\npercipients had formed a theory\u2014the one that would most naturally\noccur to them\u2014on the subject. It is also noteworthy that in this\ncase, as in so many of the unrecognised ones, the phenomena began\nwith unaccountable noises, which had alarmed the children a good\ndeal before they saw the apparition ; and it seems probable that,\nwhen the experiences had once begun, the alarm and discussion they\noccasioned may have encouraged both a tendency to experience\nhallucinations, and a tendency to exaggerate them in memory. But\nwe have first-hand evidence from seven different percipients\u2014six of\nwhom were children at the time, though old enough to give fairly\ntrustworthy accounts\u2014and it is important that the first appearance\nwas a collective one, of which we have three first-hand concordant\naccounts.\n\fLocal Apparitions. 353\n(488. 14.) From Miss R. N.\n(The initials of all the persons in this case are assumed. Miss R. N.'s\naccount was written towards the end of 1891.)\n\" In July of 1885, I was staying in the country, and was reading in the\ngarden (Helen's Babies) one day, when, suddenly looking up, I saw my aunt\nstanding in front of me, she having died in the October previous. In a\nmoment or two she passed on out of my sight. This was my first experience,\nthough she had been seen by several members of the family at home.\n\" On my return home I saw her many times in the following nine months,\nand was often conscious of feeling some one in the room, which was empty\nexcept for myself. Also during that time I continually heard the most real\nand awful groans and various sorts of noises. which could not be accounted\nfor in any way. Doors opened and shut in the most mysterious way, and\nonce, when we were all working in the room my uncie occupied when with\nus, we distinctly heard knocking at the door, and on calling out ' come in,'\nthere was no response, and a cat in the room with us was full of terror,\nthough we saw nothing.\"\nThe other principal witnesses in this case were interviewed by Professor\nLodge in October, 1891. He informs us that the family consists of Dr. and\nMrs. S. ; their son, who had come to live in the house after the death of his\nwife (whom the apparition was supposed to represent) in October, 1884; and\ntheir daughter, Mrs. N.,with her son and four daughters.R. ,aged (in 1891) 23,\nE., aged 20, C. aged 19, and A., a year or two younger. The apparition\nwas first seen in 1884,\u2014soon after the aunt's death,\u2014collectively by C, A.\nand a friend, Miss G., as stated in their accounts, and soon afterwards on the\nstairs by Miss G. and A. N. together. It was seen later by a cousin, Miss\nS. ; by a servant who had formerly been the deceased lady's housemaid, and\nafterwards by Miss R.N., as she relates. The apparition was generally seen\nin or near Mr. S.'s bedroom and dressing-room, where also mysterious\nnoises\u2014whirrings, voices and taps\u2014were often heard by several members of\nthe household, and doors were said to open and shut unaccountably, much\nto the alarm of the children ; the cat also showed signs of terror. The\nmanifestations went on for about a year and a half, and ceased about\nFebruary, 1886, when Mr. S. married again and left the house. In July,\n1886, he was visiting in the house, when the children again fancied they saw\ntheir aunt. The incidents were not mentioned to him, but Dr. and Mrs.\nS. and Mrs.N. confirmed the percipients' accounts. Professor Lodge gathered\nthat the figure seen was at first unrecognised and the subsequent\nappearances often vague and shadowy, the recognition being perhaps subse\nquently inferred, and the children's alarm tending to make them at the time\nemphasise everything that occurred ; though they were inclined afterwards, he\nthought, in giving him their testimony, to minimise the incidents.\nThe following accounts are given by the percipients :\u2014\nFrom Miss E. N.\nNovember, 1891.\n\" In the winter following my aunt's death, 1884 to 1885, my uncle,\nwho was living with us, was away for a short time, and wrote begging my\nmother to get something for him out of his wardrobe. I went with my\n2 A\n\f354 [chap.\nReport on the Census of Hallucinations.\nmother into his room at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and as we opened\nthe wardrobe door, we heard the most appalling noise. The only thing I can\nat all compare it to, is the letting loose of a quantity of clock machinery,\nand yet that doesn't really describe it, and it was more violent. While it\nlasted, which was about half a minute, we clung together in terror, and\nthen we looked everywhere for an explanation, but could find none, and\nnever have. No one else in the house heard it, though it was so loud, and\nwe never heard it again.\n\" During that winter my sisters and others continually saw my aunt, but\nit was not till the following winter that I saw anything, when, one evening,\nas I was going upstairs alone, I half saw a figure turn the corner of the\nstaircase in front of me. I should scarcely say that 1 saw a figure, for what\nI did see was so shadowy and vague, and was more like the sweep of a dress\nround the corner, but it was gone almost before I had seen it. I distinctly\nremember stopping and feeling afraid to go on, but hearing my mother and\nsisters talking in one of the bedrooms, ran up and joined them. Often\nduring the two years my aunt was seen, I have noticed doors unaccountably\nopened and shut; also the cat used sometimes to show signs of great terror,\nand would race about in a frantic way. When alone in a room I have often\nfelt as if some one else were present.\n\" I was thirteen when my aunt died, and we were very fearless, and\nuntil my aunt was seen had no belief in anything supernatural. I have\noften wondered why I, who was more frightened than my sisters, never\nproperly saw tny aunt, while they often did.\"\nFrom Miss C. N.\n[November, 1891].\n\" When I first thought that I saw my aunt, I was 12 years old; it was in\n1884, about two months after her death. I was playing in the drawing-room\nwhen suddenly I noticed a tall figure in black leave the room. The others had\nalso seen it ; we were not frightened, only very much surprised, because we\nhad not seen any one enter, and it was certainly no member of the family.\nWhen we ran out of the room to see where the person had disappeared to,\nthere was no sign of her anywhere. Later on the same day, I was going\nupstairs, when I was again surprised by seeing the same person walking\nacross the landing from one bedroom to another. Just at the same moment\nmy sister and friend came up ; they had also seen the figure.\n\" One evening at about 7 o'clock, when every one of the family were at\ndinner, I passed my mother's open door ; there I saw the same figure\nstanding in the doorway ; her face was turned from me towards the room ;\nI looked hard at her for one minute, then ran on. When I reached the top of\nthe stairs I. looked again, but she had quite vanished.\n\" Another evening I went up to my grandmother's room to speak to\nher ; there was a long screen in front of the door, so that I could not see\ninto the room when I first entered. I stopped at the door for a second,\nfor I heard what I thought was my grandmother walking about the\nroom Just as I was going to run past the screen, the same figure dressed in\nblack with a white shawl, passed me very quickly and went into the dressing-\nroom, which was out of the bedroom. My first impulse was to follow her,\n\fXVI.] 355\nLocal A1yparitions.\nbat I heard such a strange noise in the dressing-room that I feared to enter.\nI do not remember being really frightened at the time, for I never saw the\nface distinctly.\n\"The last time that I ever felt anything was nearly two years later,\nin July, 1886. When my sister and I, who then occupied the room that\nour uncle had used when he was with us, were just settling to sleep,we were\nsuddenly roused by the most awful feeling of terror; it was quite dark, but\nwe felt that something or some one supernatural was standing by the bed\nside looking at us. I cannot describe it, for we did not see or hear anything\ndistinctly ; for a few minutes we were almost beside ourselves with\nfear\u2014in too great a terror to move or look up. At last we summoned up\ncourage to rush out of the room. Our mother came back into the room with\nus, and, after lighting the gas and assuring us that it must have been\nimagination, we got back into bed. and heard nothing more all night.\nI never saw anything again, though I often thought I heard sighs and voices\nin my uncle's room previously.\"\nFrom Miss A. N.\n[November, 1891.]\n\"... We were then very young children, and fond of playing hide-\nand-seek. Our uncle had come to live with us after our aunt's death, and\nconstantly, when hiding in his room, we thought we heard sighs and groans,\nthat were quite unaccountable. We were naturally frightened at this, and\nsoon learned to avoid playing in his room.\n\" Before very long we also began to see strange things. One afternoon,\nwhen hiding in the drawing-room behind the sofa, some one walked out\nof the room quite suddenly. No grown-up person had been in the room,\nand this appeared to be a tall lady in a black dress and a white shawl, who\nmight very well have been our aunt. At any rate, it was nobody in the\nhouse, because we ascertained that by inquiring of every one if they had\nbeen in the drawing-room at all, and were answered in the negative.\nBesides, I certainly remember being impressed with the fact that I had seen\nno one enter the room. . . .\"\n[Miss A. N. describes further two subsequent appearances of the figure\nto her, and confirms the incident related at the end of Miss C. N.'s account.]\nFrom Miss O.\n(Sent to Professor Lodge.)\n\" In the winter of 1884 I was spending the day at a friend's house. I\nwas then 11 years old. The little girls of the house and myself were play\ning at hide-and-seek, and two or three of us ran into the drawing-room and\nhid behind the sofa. Suddenly I saw a figure pass across the end of the room,\nand disappear through the door. I could see no face, and the figure glided,\nrather than walked ; it was dark and shadowy, but I could see plainly it\nwas no shadow ; neither was it any one of the household. We were all\nrather startled, but I did not feel really afraid until I saw the same figure\nagain.\n\" I was chasing one of the little girls upstairs, and when I came in sight of\nthe landing the figure I had seen before passed from one of the rooms to the\n2 a 2\n\f356 [chap.\nReport on the Census of Hallucination*.\nother. At first I thought it might be my friend, but she too had stopped\non the stairs, and we both exclaimed. We searched all the rooms on that\nlanding, but did not find any one at all. I only saw the figure twice, as I\nwent away from England very soon after.\"\nFrom Mrs. N.'s niece, Miss S.\n(Apparently written in December, 1891.)\n\"The only time I ever heard or saw anything at House was one day\nwhen, standing by myself on the landing of the first floor, some noise attracted\nmy attention, and, looking round, I saw a tall figure in a grey gown come out\nof one of the bedrooms, and go into the adjoining dressing-room, but without\nturning its face in my direction. Being quite ignorant of what had been\noccurring there, I only concluded that it was some visitor, and did not hear\nuntil later in the day that there was no one answering to that description in\nthe house. I saw the figure quite distinctly ; it made no sound in walking,\nwhich did not strike me as at all strange, as it had only a wrapper on, and\nprobably, as I thought, bedroom slippers.\"\nThe housemaid referred to in Professor Lodge's account writes to\nMrs. N. :\u2014\nNovember 6th, 1891.\n\" I was rather surprised to hear that you should think it was because I\nwas afraid to stay that I left House; that was not the reason. I left\nbecause I did not feel well enough to do my work.\n\" I certainly did hear sounds, and thought I saw a figure in my bedroom\nseveral times. As I was not strong, it upset me a little, and made me feel\nnervous ; so once or twice I asked F. to sleep with me, as I felt afraid. The\nsounds were as if some one was walking back and to across the floor, and\nmade the boards creak ; the figure was of a lady in a night-gown. Once it\ncame to my bedside and leaned over me, but, as I had been dreaming of my\ndear Mrs. S., and was still thinking of her when I awoke, that may have\nbeen imagination.\"\nLocal Apparitions of Living Persons.\nWe have also a small number of cases in which apparitions, seen\nin certain places by more than one person independently, are reported\nby at least one of the percipients as representing persons who were\nliving at the time.\nIn the following case, which resembles that of Mrs. L. F. and Miss\nA. C, quoted above, there is nothing in the experience of either\npercipient, taken by itself, to suggest a supernormal origin ; but it is a\ncurious coincidence that they both saw an apparition of the same\nperson in the same place.\n(189. 14.) From Mr. C. C.\nOctober 8th, 1889.\n\" Some time in the early summer of 1850, '51, '52, or '53, 1 was standing\non the grass close to the verandah of a country house which we occupied\n\fXVI.] 357\nLocal Apparitions.\nduring those years. The verandah went round two sides of the house but\nonly round one side of the drawing-room. I distinctly saw the appearance\nof my father, the late Mr. Justice C, standing closo to and looking out of\nthe drawing-room window, which opened on to the verandah. I made a\nmental note at the time, and felt a little anxious till he came down from\ntown, either on that evening or the next. My father was appointed a judge\nin 1852, and I am inclined to think the above incident took place when he\nwas a judge, but of this I am not at all sure. The house was four miles\nfrom H , where we lived from 1848 to 1853. I was, I think, about 19\nyears old. I was in good health, and in no particular grief or anxiety.\n\"My father was in London, attending to his usual business as barrister\nor as judge, and we were in no anxiety about his health or otherwise.\n\"My sister (Mrs. R.) had an almost identical experience, seeing the\nappearance of my father looking out of another window in the drawing-room,\non the side where there was no verandah. Whether it was at the same\ntime, we have no means of deciding. Neither of us knew of the experience\nof the other till the other day, September 29th, 1889, at my brother-in-law's\nhouse. I do not remember [having such an experience on] any other\noccasion.\"\n(189. 16.) From Mrs. R.\nOctober 16th, 1889.\n\" When I was a young girl, I was one day in the garden of the country\nhouse we occupied, and, looking towards the house, saw my father, Mr.\nJustice C, standing at and looking through the drawing-room window on\nthe ground floor. The window was not open. It was not the window\nopening on to the verandah, mentioned in the previous answer by my\nbrother, Mr. C. C. The impression was momentary, and I was satisfied at\nthe time that it could not be my father himself. It was summer, and in\nbroad daylight. I was walking or playing in the garden. I was not out of\nhealth, or in grief or anxiety. I cannot recollect in what year it took place,\nor my exact age, but I was certainly over ten when we first went to the\nhouse and fifteen when we left it (about 1850). I believe my father was\naway from home at the time, but I do not know what he was doing. No\n[one was with me at the time]. I was greatly surprised at the end of last\nmonth to hear of my brother's similar experience. I believe I never heard\nof it before. I do not think I ever mentioned mine to any one at the time\nor since till we received these papers ; but I told it to the collector before\nhearing my brother's experience, and he told his before hearing of mine.\n\" [I have had] no [other such experiences].\"\nIn this case, it may be a mere accident that the apparition was\nseen both times in the same place\u2014the place being in the house in\nwhich the percipients lived ; but there is a certain interest in repeated\napparitions of the same person. See Phantasms of the Living (Vol. II.,\npp. 77-90) and Miss Maughan's case,1 (pp. 273-7).\n1 Another case of this kind taken from the Census is Mr. Hasted's (see Journal\nS.P.R., Vol. VI., p. 131.)\n\f358 Report on the Cenma of HaUucinations. [chap.\nWe have quoted above a case of an apparition of a living person\nseen in a house which the percipient afterwards heard was reputed to\nbe \"haunted\" (No. 240.13, p. 188), but in which the only other\ndefinite incident recorded was the apparition of another living person\nto another percipient. See also No. 684. 1 (p. 191), where the appari\ntions of two children were seen at different times by their parents.\nThese cases may, of course, be explained as merely subjective halluci\nnations, and the occurrence of two of them in the same place may be\npurely accidental.\nThe following is a case of similar apparitions seen in the same\nhouse by three persons\u2014two of whom saw them independently,\u2014\nwhich there is some reason to regard as representing some one who\nafterwards came to the house. The parallel with \" haunts \" where the\napparition is supposed to represent some deceased person unknown to\nthe percipients, is very close. There was undoubtedly some resemblance\nbetween the apparition and the person in question, and it seems likely\nthat, if the percipients had had no more opportunity of making the\ncomparison than would be possible in the case of a supposed apparition\nof the dead, they might have come to the conclusion that there could\nbe no doubt of the identification.\nThe case is instructive, because we have unusually full and well-\nauthenticated information about it, including an account written\nbefore there was any question of identification. We also happen\nto possess a less authentic account\u2014probably at third-hand\u2014which\nwe print as illustrating the additional impressiveness that narratives\nof this kind are likely to gain in passing from hand to hand. It\nwill be observed that the tempting hypothesis of reciprocity in super\nnormal perception is suggested by this account, but the evidence which\nsuggests it is denied by the lady who is in the best position for making\nstatements on the subject.\n(267. 1.) From Mr. G. S.\nDecember 30th, 1889.\n\" On the Saturday which was on or nearest to October 22nd, 1886, at the\nhouse of Dr. E , , on entering the drawing-room on the first floor\nshortly after 4 o'clock, afternoon, I saw, seated on a settee, with her back to\nme, a young lady in a brown dress, with a broad lace collar. She was present\nin the room for some minutes after, and I saw her as I sat talking to Mrs. E.\nand a gentleman caller whose name I forget. Her hair was reddish gold in\nthe gleam of the fire. I only saw the round of her right cheek, which\nappeared fresh and plump. She appeared to be reading, but I could not see\nthe book. When the gentleman rose to go, I looked round for her expecting,\nand wishing, to be introduced, but she was gone. The light in the room at\nthe time consisted of a fine open fire, and a gas lamp on each side at the\nusual level of a bell pull. The girl's back was to the fire, and she sat in the\n\fLocal Airparitions. 359\nmiddle of the settee. Mrs. E. sat on the side of the settee nearest the fire,\nfacing it, and to the right of the settee. The caller sat on a chair near the\nend of the settee furthest from Mrs. E. I was 28 years of age, in my normal\nhealth (i.e., slightly below par), and in good spirits. I had just been com\npleting the exchange of a lease for Mrs. E.'s son L., who had lately married.\nI never saw the girl before. The gentleman seemed to be looking straight\ntowards the girl, but he took no notice of her, and I did not speak of her to\nMrs. E. till he was gone, and Mrs. E. disclaimed any knowledge of her\u2014\nand was rather frightened\u2014so I laughed the matter off. [I have] never [had\nany other such experience.]\"\nMr. S. wrote an account of his experience shortly after it happened, but\nthis account was unfortunately lost by the friend to whom it was given. The\nfollowing letter from Mr. S. to the collector, Mr. C. W. C. Oman, of All\nSouls' College, Oxford, gives further particulars.\nOctober 2Qth, 1887.\n\" You may remember my telling you last year that on Saturday,\nOctober 23rd (I think that was the date), I saw an apparition, in\nStreet. Now, on the 20th of this month, it has again been seen by a\nguest in the same house, and on the 27th by a servant\u2014each time in a\ndifferent room from the room where I saw it. The guest was a Mrs. R.,\nwho called at the house, after I had seen the figure last year, on the same\nafternoon. This year she was staying in the house ; she was not quite well,\nand was having dinner in bed about 7.30, when in walked a fair-haired\nyoung lady, of two or three and twenty, in a brown dress, with a broad lace\ncollar\u2014the dress being of the style that used [to] be known as ' Princess '\ncut. She advanced without a word to the cheval-glass, and began to take\ndown her hair. Mrs. R. was not in the least frightened, taking her for a\nreal flesh and blood woman. She got out of bed, and, walking up to the\nglass, laid her hand on the girl's shoulder ; but it passed through empty air,\nand she found herself looking at her own self in the glass. Even then,\nshe said, she was puzzled, not frightened. I questioned her this evening\nabout the ' ghost's ' height, shape, dress, contour of face, etc., and she con\nfirmed my recollection in every way, except the manner of dressing the\nhair, on which she was hazy.\n\"The servant, on the other hand, is very clear, both about the lace\ncollar, the colour of the dress, and the dressing of the hair, and its peculiar\ncolour. She saw the figure walk into the dining-room, which has only one\ndoor, and, following it, found no one in the room. The chimney and window\nwere the only exits, and the latter is over an area lined with spikes, and\n15ft. deep. I asked Mrs. R. some questions designed to lead her astray, but\nshe kept straight to details which I could corroborate. For instance, when\nI suggested puffed sleeves, she stuck to the simple ' Princess ' cut.\"\nMr. S. writes further :\u2014\nDecember 30th, 1889.\n\" In August, 1888, Mrs. E.'s son P.'s wife (whom he married in\nAustralia, and whom Mrs. E. had never seen) arrived from Sydney. I saw\nher. She was out of health, and her hair had been cut off shortly before\nthe started for England. It was of a reddish hue. I did not recognise\n\f360 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nher. She went into the country, and came back in October restored in\nhealth. Shortly after her return Mrs. R. was dining with Mrs. E., and\nMrs. P. E. came down in a brown tea-gown and broad lace collar. Mrs.\nR. and Martha at once recognised her as the brown lady. By Mrs. E.'s-\ndesire, nothing was said to Mrs. P. E., who is of a highly nervous tempera\nment, and I believe nothing has been said to her yet. She returned to\nAustralia in the year 1888, only to return this year (1889), and arrive at\nMrs. E.'s house at the end of October.\"\nApril 23rd, 1890.\n\" So far as I am aware there is no further reason for thinking that the\napparition was Mrs. P. E. beyond the recognition by Mrs. R. and the servant.\nI have not made personal inquiries to see wliether the recognitions were\nindependent in each case. Since I filled up the return I have met Mrs.\nP. E. She was then in a brown dress of the colour I remember, and some\nthing of the shape about the shoulders, but she did not strike me as being\nthe same type of head as that of the apparition I saw. However, 1 only\nsaw the round of the cheek of the apparition at such an angle that the nose\nand shape of the eye were quite hidden. The first time I saw her (Mrs.\nP. E.) she was not in a brown dress. She was then recovering from a rather\nexhausting illness.\"\nApril 29th, 1890.\n\" [Having seen] Mrs. P. E. [again], I took an opportunity of looking at\nher from, as nearly as I could, the same angle as I saw the apparition from,\nand I find I was mistaken in thinking the shape of her head would give a\ndifferent effect from that of the apparition. From that point of view the\noutline of her cheek corresponds very fairly with that of the apparition.\n\"G. S.\"\nMrs. E. writes :\u2014\nMay bili, 1891.\n\" My son's young wife came to England from Australia in exceedingly-\ndelicate health, and Mrs. R., seeing her one day in a long brown tea-gown,\nexclaimed to me, ' Why, I believe the figure I saw was ; ' and the\nservant also seemed to think there was some resemblance ; but Mr. S. was\nnever struck by any such likeness to the figure he saw in the drawing-room.\n. . . I doubt very much if there is any association between her and the\nfigure seen by the others.\"\nMrs. E. sent us the following letter, from Mrs. R. to herself, describing\nher experience.\nMay 9th [1891].\n\" I remember every detail. As you know I am not a nervous or excitable\nperson, and don't get ' mixed up ' in my impressions. The facts were these :\u2014\nI was staying with you in the October of, I think, 1888, but I know it was\nthe October before P. 's wife came home on that visit. I had a cold, and\nremained in bed all day. When [my] dinner [came] I sat up in bed, and ate\n[it] with the tray on a pillow before me for an improvised table. The gas was\nfull on. I had just finished, had put the tray on the table beside my bed, and\nwas going to lie down. but was still sitting up\u2014when the door opened gently\n(the red door at the foot of the bed, as the room was then arranged), and a.\n\fLocal Apparitions. 361\nwoman came quietly in. At the first moment I thought it was you, and I had\nsaid ' Oh, L., how quick you have been ! ' before I realised that it was not you.\nIt was somebody I had never seen, but I had no time to see her face properly;\nshe took no notice of me, but walked up to the toilet table and put up her\nhands as if she was going to take her hair down. The gas shone full on her\nhair, and I saw that it was fair hair, and she had on a long plain brown dress.\nI did not feel at all alarmed, but very curious and surprised, and I jumped out\nof bed, came up behind her, and was going to touch her on the shoulder, when\nshe vanished. You know how small the room was, and that she could not have\npassed me without touching mo. I got back into bed, and then I remembered\nwhat I had been told about Mr. S. and Martha having seen a brown woman.\nIt had not made much impression on me ; and I certainly was not thinking\nabout it when the door opened and my brown woman walked in. When you\ncame up, I told you about it, and we discussed the matter, and wondered\nwhat it could mean. I had never seen any one at all resembling the appari\ntion before, but I afterwards distinctly recognised her in P.'s wife, who came\nhome ill, and occupied the same room as the one I had seen her [in].\"\nMrs. E. adds, in sending this letter, that she finds, from a diary, that\nMrs. R. was staying with her in October, 1887, and was ill in bed about the\n19th. Her son's wife came to England in 1888, and she thought it was in\nOctober, 1886, that Mr. S. saw the figure, as she knew that he had called on\nher one afternoon about that time.\nThe following account was written by Mrs.E.'s parlourmaid, Martha .\n\" In the early part of October, in 1887, while sitting at tea in the kitchen\nof a large house in the West-End of London, with three other servants (all\nthat were kept besides myself), the visitors' bell rang, and on reaching the\nhall, before opening the door, I distinctly saw the back of a tall, fair lady\nwalking into the dining-room, as if from the study. It was light enough for\nme to see that the lady had golden hair, coiled near the top of her head,\nand a brown dress, made ' Princess' rol)e fashion, a little long behind.\n\" I thought it was my own lady, by only glancing at her and seeing my\nlady's little dog running from her towards the door. I wondered what brown\ndress it could be, as a few minutes before I had left my lady at the top of\nthe house in a green tea gown. Whilst opening the front door nobody could\npossibly have come out of tho dining-room without my seeing them ; but on\ngoing into the room, to my astonishment, I found nobody there, nor in the\nstudy, or anywhere about ; and on going upstairs was surprised to see my\nlady with the green gown on still, and neither herself nor the lady [Mrs. R.}\nthat was with her had left the room since I left them before the kitchen tea.\nWe have never been able to account for the strange lady's appearance,\nalthough I have since heard that the same lady had been seen by a gentleman\nsitting in the drawing-room some time previous.\"\nMrs. Sidgwick writes :\u2014\nMag 9th, 1890.\n\" I called to-day on Mrs. E., and saw the parlourmaid Martha, who saw\nthe figure resembling that seen by Mr. S. She struck me as a very sensible\nwitness. She does not think she had heard of Mr. S. 's seeing the figure\n\f362 Report on the Census of Hallucinations, [chap.\n(Mrs. R. saw it later than she did), and is at any rate quite sure that she\nwas not thinking of it or expecting it. [The account she gave to Mrs. Sidg-\nwick agreed closely with the account which she wrote shortly after.] Besides\nMrs. E. and Mrs. R., no one else was in the house except the servants, and\nthey were downstairs all the time. The light was good enough to distinguish\ncolour, etc., without any doubt. The likeness to Mrs. P. E. did not strike\nher till after Mrs. R. had called attention to it.\n\" Noises as of rustling paper have been heard in the back drawing-room,\ncontinued for some time and heard by all.\"\nThe following is the more impressive, but less authentic, account, before\nmentioned.\n\" Some two years ago a distant connection, a Mrs. R., was at the house of\na friend in street. She had not risen for breakfast ; suddenly she saw a\nyoung lady standing by her dressing-table, the chief thing about her being\nher golden hair ; on looking again nothing was to be seen. On going down\nto lunch she mentioned the matter to her hostess, Mrs. E., and then learned\nthat nearly all in the house had seen the same thing. Some days after, in\nthe afternoon, a gentleman who was calling desired to be introduced to a\nlady present, and when asked which one, described the figure before seen.\nNews soon came that the wife of a son who had married an Australian lady\nwas on her way to England on account of her health, and when Mrs. E.\nmet her she at once recognised the figure ; the servants also did this, and the\nyoung wife when she reached the house knew which was her room, etc. It\nwas found that the patient was subject to trances, during which she could not\nbe roused. I met in Surrey a few months back a lady of the same name,\nand on enquiry found that she was the sister-in-law of the Astral (?) shape.\nShe informed me that the reason the golden hair was so prominent was that,\nhaving been cut off during typhoid fever, it had grown into a kind of mass.\n. . . Several London physicians saw the case.\"\nIn reply to our enquiries as to the accuracy of the further details given\nin this account, Mrs. E. wrote :\u2014\n\" The unknown narrator of our story has not been accurate in the facts.\nMrs. P. E. has never been in a trance, but when she first came to\nEngland she was in such a debilitated condition of health that any over\nexertion would cause her to become unconscious for some minutes. She\nhas often told me that while she was ill in Australia she used to try and\npicture to herself the home her husband used to describe to her, but I do\nnot remember that when she arrived here she recognised any particular\nroom.\"\nThe cases we have given in this chapter, in addition to others of\nthe same kind to be found in previous numbers of the Proceedings,\nconstitute, we think, a strong Ixxly of evidence showing that appari\ntions are seen in certain places independently by several percipients,\nunder circumstances which make it difficult to suppose that the\nphenomena are merely subjective, or that they can be explained by\n\fXVI.] 363\nLocal Apparitions.\ntelepathy,1 without considerable straining of our general conception of\nit. It appears, however, that there is in most cases very little ground\nfor attributing the phenomena to the agency of dead persons. The\napparitions represent occasionally living and occasionally dead persons,\nbut, as we have said, in the great majority of cases, they are un\nrecognised ; and, in these cases, if they really represent any actual\nperson, there is often no more reason to suppose the person dead than\nliving.\n1 For a discussion of the liossibility of this explanation, see Mr. Podmore's paper\non \"Phantasms of the Dead from Another Point of View,\" Proceedings, Vol. VI.,\npp. 229 313.\n\f364 [chap.\nReport on the Census of Hallucinations.\nChapter XVII.\nPHANTASMS OF THE DEAD.\nIa the present Chapter we propose first to compare recognised\nphantasms of dead persons with other phantasms, and secondly to con\nsider what evidence, if any, the Census affords of the possibility of\ncommunication between the dead and the living. Phantasms of the\ndead must be understood to include, in addition to those enumerated\nas such in the Tables under the head of \" realistic human phantasms,\"\n16 of the \" incompletely developed apparitions \" and 2 of the \" visions.\"\nAs regards the first question, we may infer from the Tables\u2014as\nwas explained in Chapter III , p. 67\u2014that phantasms of the dead are\nrarer than phantasms of the living ; and this would be true even if we\ntransferred the 95 death-coincidences (80 visual and 15 only auditory)\nto the class of phantasms of the dead. We have also in Chapter III.\n(pp. 67\u201468) shown that they are on the whole more impressive than\nother phantasms. Another characteristic of them as a class, which\nmay be deduced from Table II., is that bisensory and trisensory\nhallucinations are relatively frequent among them. From Table VII.,\nagain, we see that a relatively large proportion of the auditory\napparitions of the dead consist of something more than the mere\ncalling of the percipient's name : and from Table V. it appears that\napparitions of the dead are rarely seen out of doors. The qualities\nthus reported to us as possessed more frequently by phantasms of the\ndead indicate a smaller admixture among them of illusion and mis\ntaken identity, and a more than average degree of fulness and com\npleteness in the hallucinations. They are most of them, it will lie\nremembered, qualities which we have already noticed as belonging to\nthe class of death-coincidences.1\nApparitions of the dead, like other apparitions, usually appear\ndressed like ordinary human beings, and without symbolic accompani\nments such as white robes or wings. We have, indeed, only one case\nof wings (418. 5) in this class of phantasms, which is also a case of an\nincompletely developed figure. Our informant describes an apparition of\nhis mother on the night after her death. He had prayed to see her and\n' ' about midnight she appeared as [a] head and shoulders with wings. She\nkissed me three times on the right cheek. I tried to speak to her, but could\nnot. She then went straight up through the roof. I wakened my brother,\nwho was asleep beside me, but he had seen nothing. [My age was] 19. '\"2\n1 See p. 246, note, and pp. 301\u20142.\ns The date of the experience is February, 1884 : the narrative was written in April,\n1891.\n\fXVII.] 365\nPhantasms of the Dead.\nIn four cases it is specially mentioned that the phantasm appeared\nin the clothes in which the dead person was buried (see for an instance\nNo. 733. 18, p. 141). Usually the appearance in dress or other\nwise is what the percipient was accustomed to associate with the per\nson in life (an exception is No. 579. 23, see p. 378), though in 3 cases\nit is stated that the apparition looked younger than its counterpart\nwhen last seen : No. 196. 4, p. 368, is an instance.\nWe turn now to the question what evidence, if any, the Census\naffords of the possibility of communication from the dead to the living.\nTo establish this possibility would be a result of far greater importance\nthan any which our investigation has yet achieved ; since it would\ncarry with it proof of continued existence after death, and continued\ninterest taken by the dead in those still in the body. Incidentally it\nwould suggest that telepathy is probably a phenomenon caused inde\npendently of any physical process outside of, and intervening between,\nthe bodies of the human beings concerned ; since there is no reason to\nregard the apparent communications from the dead as of a different\nnature from those which we are able to trace to living agents ; while\nit is difficult to suppose that the communication from the dead depends\non localisation in space and the setting in motion of a physical\nmedium.\nConversely, if we arrived at the conclusion that telepathic com\nmunication between living men occurs independently of any physical\nprocess through the intervening space, we should certainly have taken\nan important step towards proving that the mind is not essentially\ndependent on the body ; and we should thereby have got rid of an\nimportant argument for supposing that the death of the body carries\nwith it the extinction of the mind, or at least the termination of its\npower of communicating with another mind. On the other hand,\nwhile the recognition of telepathic communication between the living\nrtiay make the reality of communication with the dead more probable\nthan it otherwise would be, it at the same time makes it more difficult\nto prove. The evidence that an apparent communication from a dead\nperson is not purely subjective must, as in the case of apparent com\nmunication from the living, depend, in the main, either on its coinci\ndence with some state of the supposed agent unknown to the\npercipient, suggesting a causal connexion between that state and the\nhallucination ; or on information unknown to the percipient being\nconveyed by the phantasm. Coincidence\u2014as will have been perceived\n\u2014is the commonest ground of evidence in the cases of spontaneous\ntelepathy which we have laid before the reader in previous chapters ;\nthe conveyance of definite information being comparatively rare. But\nin the case of phantasms of the dead, our ignorance of the actual\ncondition of the dead makes it possible to establish coincidence only\n\f366 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nin a very limited class of cases\u2014viz., those in which the death has\ntaken place, but is not known to the percipient to have taken place.\nWe should therefore expect to find the cases which, primd facie, are\nnot explicable as purely subjective hallucinations to be rare among\nthe phantasms of the dead. But even among these rare cases we\nmeet with another difficulty in proving them to be due to the\ninfluence of the dead. The difficulty is that verifiable information is\nseldom unknown to living persons, and, therefore, granting telepathy,\nthe percipient may have received it telepathically from the living and\nnot from the dead. Even if it be really unknown to any living\nperson, but yet verifiable,\u2014e.g., by means of documents put away by the\ndeceased person during his life,\u2014there is still an alternative hypothesis\nto be taken into account, viz., that an extension of supernormal\nperception, such as is involved in some (alleged) cases of clairvoyance,\nenabled the percipient to acquire the knowledge without the aid of\nany other individual mind. The difficulties that lie in the way of\nproving communication from the dead are therefore necessarily great,\nand even if it is to be ultimately established, we must expect the\naccumulation of the requisite evidence to be slow and laborious.\nIn the present chapter we intend to lay before the reader the\nchief cases furnished by the Census of phantasms of the dead which\nhave a primd facie veridical character, irrespective of the question\nwhether the truth imparted can be supposed to come from the dead,\u2014\na question, however, on which we shall endeavour to throw such light\nas our statistics afford.\nWe shall begin by considering the cases in which the ground for\nattributing veridicality is a coincidence. In dealing with this part of\nthe subject we cannot leave out of account the death-concidences which\nwe have already considered from another point of view. Indeed, those\nof them which occur after the death, however near it, are strictly\nspeaking phantasms of the dead ; and those which occur at the moment\nof death are ambiguous,\u2014we cannot say that they are clearly phantasms\nof either the living or the dead. Our reasons for counting them so far\nwith phantasms of the living were twofold. In the first place, it is with\nphantasms of the living that we must group them in order to calculate\nthe probability of the coincidence being due to chance alone ;\nthe probability that any recognised phantasm of the dead will coincide\nwith the death being one which our data do not enable us satisfactorily\nto estimate.1 Secondly, it is desirable in establishing new facts to pro-\n1 It will be remembered that the calculation as to the probability of the apparition\nof a living person being seen on the day of his death was founded on the registered\ndeath rate (see p. 245). The death-rate is calculated in proportion to the population,\nhut it would be obviously difficult to estimate the factor corresponding to the popula\ntion in the case of dead persons.\n\fXVII.] 3G7\nPhantasms of the Dead.\nceed from the known to the unknown. The possibility of telepathy\nbetween living persons has been shown experimentally, and, if we\naccept the result of those experiments, there is little difficulty in extend\ning our conception so as to include spontaneous cases ; further,\u2014since\nwe have some. evidence suggesting that ideas may sometimes remain\nlatent and only emerge into consciousness by means of a hallucination\nafter an interval of time,\u2014there is no great difficulty in supposing that\nthe telepathic impulse from the dying person may have occurred at or\nbefore death, and not have produced a manifest effect on the percipient\nuntil a few hours later. A belief in the possibility of communications\nfrom the dead is therefore not necessarily involved in the acceptance\nof the veridical character of death -coincidences. But in studying\nphantasms of the dead as such, we take a different point of view ; from\nwhich it becomes important to distinguish and compare three different\nkinds of death-coincidences,\u2014those in which the hallucination occurs\nbefore death, those in which it occurs after death, and those in which\nit is strictly simultaneous with the death.\nThe 801 cases reported to us as visual death-coincidences divide\nthemselves as follows :\u2014\nThe apparition is known to have occurred before the death\u2014the\ninterval being from a few minutes to 12 hours\u2014in 7 cases, of which\nNos. 645. 11 (p. 233) and 571. 14 (p. 237) are instances. It is known\nto have occurred at similar intervals after the death in 10 cases, of\nwhich Nos. 425. 12 (p. 211), 381. 4 (p. 214), 579. 24 (p. 223),\n379. 24 (p. 225), 450. 18 (p. 234), 328. 5 (p. 235), and 579. 25\n(p. 241) are instances. In 50 cases the coincidence between the\napparition and the death is described in some such way as \"on the\nday and at the time\" (No. 362. 21, p. 217), \" at that hour\" (No.\n215. 9, p. 224), \"at that exact time\" (No. 385.20, p. 239), \"coincided\nas nearly as we could make out with the moment \" (No. 725. 6,\np. 237), \"about the time\" (No. 452. 10, p. 238). Or the hour at\nwhich both events occurred is named, as in No. 147. 23, p. 218 ;\nor approximately named, as in an unprinted case when the appari\ntion is said to have been seen about 3 a.m., and the death to have\noccurred \"in the night at some time after 12.\" In some of these\ncases we have adequate reason to regard the coincidence as really\nexact to a minute or two ; in others we interpret our informants'\nphrases as leaving it undecided whether the apparition preceded\nor followed the death by an interval . of an hour or two or less.\nIn a few cases again, the expression used probably means no more\nthan on the same day or same night,\u2014or even possibly an interval\nexceeding 1 2 hours, since we have seen reason 2 to believe that too\n1 See Chapter XII., p. 208, for the exact definition of this group.\nJ See Chapter XII., p. 242.\n\f368 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nmany remote cases are reported as death-coincidences. In the 13\nremaining cases out of the 80, the coincidence is not asserted to have\nhad the closeness which ought strictly to be implied in the phrases\nabove quoted, though the apparition is reported to have occurred on\nthe same day or night as the death. For our present purpose neither\nof these two latter classes can be counted as in strictness phantasms\neither of the living or of the dead.\nOf the 15 auditory death-coincidences\u2014in which voices are recog\nnised, but there is no recognised apparition\u2014two-thirds are similarly\nuncertain1 ; but for the present it will be convenient to confine our\nattention to phantasms of which one element is a recognised apparition.\nWe have then, among cases previously counted with apparitions of\nof the living, 10 in which the person seen was actually dead, although\nthe fact was unknown to the percipient. There are 7 other cases which\noccurred within 12 hours of the death, but in which the death was\nknown, so that they have been already counted as apparitions of the\ndead.2 One of these has been already described in this chapter.\nIt is of course obvious that the very fact which often makes ap\nparitions of this kind specially impressive to the percipient\u2014the\nfact that they come at the crisis of acutest grief\u2014also renders it easy\nto explain them as purely subjective phenomena, caused by the grief\nwhich they console.\nThe class to which we now pass does not admit of being similarly\nexplained. Extending our examination beyond the 12 hours after\ndeath, we find 93 apparitions which occurred more than 12 hours after\nthe death, but while it was still unknown to the percipient. The\nfollowing are the best-evidenced cases of this class. In the first, the\nhallucination occurred less than two days after the death, but the\nforce of the coincidence is weakened by the anxiety of the percipient\nabout her friend's illness. It must be observed, however, that the\nhallucination did not occur during the period of greatest anxiety, but\nafter the percipient had heard that her friend was better.\n(196. 4.) From Mrs. Frank Malleson.\nDixton Manor, Winchcombe, Gloucestershire\n[Mrs. Malleson tells us that the account she gives is a copy of notes taken\nin March, 1885, about a month after the occurrence.]\n\" My friend, whom I had known intimately for [the] greater part of my\nlife, had become weak and failing from age, and, for a week or so, I had been\n1 Four of the fifteen (including 23. 11, see p. 256) are strictly phantasms of the\nliving : one (562. 3, see p. 17!)) is a phantasm of the dead.\n2 They were accordingly excluded from the discussion in Chapters XII. and\nXIII., see p. 208.\n3 We have excluded three cases in which it is possible\u2014and, we think, most\nprobable\u2014that there was a mistake of identity.\n\fXVII.] 369\nPhantasms of the Dead.\nreceiving very serious accounts of her condition. On the Saturday morning\n(January 31st), following days of illness, I received letters to say she was\nbetter and fears of her immediate death seemed past.\n\" On the Sunday evening, however, I had a strong impression that my\nfriend had gone from us ; but through cross-country posts I got no news on\nMonday morning. On the Monday night when I lay down in bed there\ncame to me a conviction that she was trying to make her presence felt, and\nI became aware of her standing in an angle between my bed and the fire ;\nnot oppressed with extreme age as I had often seen her in the last year or so,\nbut in the vigour of middle age when I had had most intercourse with her,\n\" The colour of her dress and cap\u2014the fashion of both\u2014were absolutely\nfamiliar to me as belonging to that time. She stood poised in a natural\nattitude\u2014her figure with absolute solidity\u2014 looking straight at my face lying\non the pillow. I felt no fear, but the strain of emotion was so great that I\nremember thinking, ' If this strain continues, there is some one in the next\nroom, and if I call out I shall be heard.'\n\" I shut my eyes, but the impression of the presence remained with me.\nThen I believe I opened them again, because I am conscious of having re\nceived another, and second, impression of the figure standing there. Then\nit disappeared, and, with all my expectation and wish of having the experi\nence over again, it has never recurred. In the morning following the\nappearance I received the news of her death, which had taken place between\n3 and 4 a.m. on the Sunday morning (February 1st). So vivid was the\nimpression produced that often now even, I avoid stepping on the place in\nmy room where the figure stood. \u201e EuzABETH Malleson.\"\nMrs. Malleson states further that when she saw the apparition she was\nreading in bed by the light of a candle placed beside her, and that this is\nthe only experience of the kind that she has ever had.\nMrs. Sidgwick writes :\u2014\nFebruary 25th, 1892.\n\" I have just seen Mrs. Malleson and talked over her experience with\nher, and seen the exact spot where the apparition stood. It was just at the\nfoot and to one side of the bed in which she lay. There is no doubt that\nit was thoroughly externalised and vivid. The account written within a few\nweeks is of course better evidence as to the facts than anything she could\ntell me now. The apparition was of an aunt of Mr. Malleson's, with whom\nshe had lived a great deal, who had taught her much and with whom\nthe tie of friendship was very close. This aunt had, Mrs. Malleson says,\nagreed with a friend in her youth that whichever died first should appear\nto the other, and had been greatly disappointed at the friend's non-appear\nance. Miss Malleson and her father both knew of the apparition before the\nnews came, I understood, and I talked to both of them about it. The\napparition wore her favourite colours.\"\nMrs. Malleson writes later :\u2014\nApril 4th, 1892.\n\" I am sure that my husband was the first person I told of the appear,\nance, but neither he nor my daughter remember my story with sufficient\nvividness and accuracy to write their testimony, I am sorry to say.\"\n2 B\n\f370 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nThe following case was originally reported to us as a \"death-coin\ncidence,\" but on investigation it appeared most probable that the\napparition was seen several days after the death had taken place,1\nthough before the percipient had heard of it, the mistake having\napparently arisen from her ignorance of the time the news must have\ntaken to travel.\n(656. 26.) From Mrs. Hall, a college bedmaker at Cambridge.\n(The account was written on February 11th, 1891.)\n\" At 7.30 I heard a knocking and turned to the door. I saw an individual,\na man which was once my master, and he said : ' Well, Agnes, how are you ? '\n' Oh, it's Mr. Middleton. ' He then vanished. [I was] sitting talking to my\nhusband, in good health, 28 years of age. ... At the same hour he\nappeared to me, he died\u2014at 7.30. My husband saw nothing, but heard the\nknocking. \u201eA Hall \u201e\nThe collector, Mr. F. W. Grantham, added to Mrs. Hall's account the\nfollowing notes, written, he believes, in May or June, 1891, from information\nwhich she gave him :\u2014\n'' [The apparition] was wearing clothes and a hat. It was February\n4th, at Cambridge. I had not seen him for some years and did not\nknow ho was ill. He was at Sheffield at the time of his death. I got a letter\nnext morning to say he had died 7.30 the previous evening.\"\nMiss Johnson called on Mrs. Hall at her own house, and gives the fol\nlowing account of her interview, written immediately after it.\nMay mh, 1892.\n\"Mrs. Hall told me that she was sitting wi$h her husband at tea on\nFebruary 4th, 1891, in the room where I saw her\u2014he was facing the door\nand she back to and on one side of it. They both heard a knock at the\ndoor, and she turned round and saw a man standing on the mat a little way\ninside. She recognised him as Mr. Middleton. He said, ' Agnes, how are\nyou ? ' She answered, and then he said no more and she could see him no\nlonger. He did not go out of the door, but simply vanished. She had not\nseen him come in either, and the door had not seemed to open\u2014she merely\nturned round and saw him. She was much startled, and told her husband.\nHe had seen nothing and had not heard the apparition speak, and he said it\nwas all nonsense. Next day at dinner-time she got a letter, telling of Mr.\nMiddleton's death. He was a retired butcher, and she had lived in his house\nfor ten years, so she knew him very well. His family have since migrated\nto America. She did not keep the letter, but thought (she was not sure of\nthis) that her husband had referred to it in writing the account on the B\nform, which he did on February 11th. (I showed her the B form, and she\ntold me that her husband had written it ; some notes are added in Mr.\nGrantham's handwriting.) She was not able to write then, as she was\nconfined on February 10th, so her husband wrote it the day after, and\n1 The case is therefore counted in the Tables as an apparition of a dead person.\n\fXVII.] 371\nPhantasms of the Decul.\nshe signed it later. She was perfectly well all the time beforehand, up to\nthe day of her baby's birth, and remembered the date of the apparition in\nrelation to this, and also as having happened a month before her husband's\ndeath, which occurred quite suddenly on March 4th, 1891.\n\" She was not sure by what light the apparition was seen, but it was per\nfectly clear, just like a real man. She thought it was a real man at first.\n\" She has never had any other hallucinations of sight, but a week or two\nafter this, she and her husband used to hear constant knockings or hammer\nings at night. They enquired of their neighbours about it, but could find no\ncause for it.\"\nAs we failed to find in the register any record of the death of Mr.\nMiddleton, Miss Johnson called again on Mrs. Hall to make further en\nquiries, and learnt from her that he had really died in America, not at\nSheffield, having migrated to America with his family some time before\nhis death. Mrs. Hall repeated that it was on February 4th, 1891,that she\nsaw the apparition, six days before her confinement. The letter telling\nof Mr. Middleton's death arrived some time between February 4th and\nFebruary 9th ; she was not sure of the exact day. She made another\nsearch for this letter, but failed to find it. It may be observed that the state\nment as to the letter arriving the \" next morning \" was not in her original\naccount, but in the notes added by the collector two or three months later.\nPutting together the date of the apparition and the limits of the time\ndurmg which the letter can have been received, it seems almost certain that\nthe death preceded the apparition, though the latter occurred before the\ndeath was known to the percipient.\n\" In the three following cases, it will be seen that the evidence for an\nexternal origin is stronger than in those just given : since in all of them,\nthe apparition is not only seen before the death is known to the\npercipient,\u2014who had not even heard of the illness,\u2014but either\ndefinitely indicates that the death has taken place, or presents some\nother primd facie veridical feature. The first is a vision occurring\nat the time of the funeral, and giving definite indications of the death.\nIt may be also remarked that the case is one in which a written note\nwas made at the time, by which the coincidence was verified when the\nnews arrived.\n(442. 15.) From Mrs. B.1\nApril, 1892.\n\"At Fiesole, on March 11th, 1869, I was giving my little children their\ndinner at half-past one o'clock. It was a fine hot day. As I was in the act\nof serving maccaroni and milk from a high tureen, so that I had to stand to\nreach it, and give my attention to what I was doing,\u2014on raising my head\n<as much from fatigue as for any purpose), the wall opposite me seemed\nto open, and I saw my mother lying dead on her bed in her little house\n1 Mrs. B. is the mother of the percipient in No. 442. 17, see p. 213.\n2 b 2\n\f372 [chap.\nReport on the Census of Hallucinations.\nat . Some flowers were at her side and on her breast ; she looked calm,\nbut unmistakably dead, and the coffin was there.\n\"It was so real that I could scarcely believe that the wall was really\nbrick and mortar, and not a transparent window\u2014in fact, it was a wall\ndividing the hotel in which we were living from the Carabinieri.\n\" I was in very weak health\u2014suffering intensely with neuralgia\u2014having\ngone through a bad confinement, brought on by travelling\u2014the baby was\nalmost still-born, on January 31st.\n\"Owing to a family quarrel, I had left England without telling my\npeople where I was going ; but I was so fond of my mother that, when in\nParis, I made an excuse to write to an old servant, who lived with my\nmother, to ask her for a toy which we had left with her\u2014the object being to\nget news of my mother. Reply came that for years she had not been so\nwell and strong ; thus I had no reason for imagining her to be dead.\n' ' I was so distressed at the vision, that I wrote to her (my mother), to\ngive her my address, and entreat her to let me know how she was. By\nreturn of post came the statement that she had died on March oth,\nand was buried on the 11th. At the hour I saw her, she was removed from\nher home to Kensal Green Cemetery. She had wished to see me so much\nthat letters had been sent to a great many continental cities, hoping I might\nbe found ; but I never got a letter from my sister till long after I had re\nceived the news of my mother's death.\n\" When I was married, my mother made me promise, as I was leaving\nhome, to be sure to let her know in any way God permitted if I died, and\nshe would try to find some way of communicating to me the fact of her\ndeath\u2014supposing that circumstances prevented the usual methods of writing\nor telegraphing. I considered the vision a fulfilment of this promise, for\nmy mind was engrossed with my own grief and pain\u2014the loss of baby, and\nmy neuralgia, and the anxieties of starting a new life.\n\" My youngest sister, since dead, was called to my mother, and left\nDevonshire, where she was staying with friends, to come home. When she\narrived at home, she entered the drawing-room, but rushed out terrified,\nexclaiming that she had seen godmamma, who was seated by the fire in my\nmother's chair. Godmamma had been dead since 1852. She had been my\nmother's governess\u2014almost foster-mother ; had lived with her during her\nmarried life, been godmother to her eldest girl, and when my father died, had\naccepted the duty of taking his place as far as possible in the family, to\nshield her from trouble and protect her\u2014a duty which she fulfilled nobly.\n\" My other sister went into the drawing room to see what had scared\nK , and saw the figure of godmamma just as K had. Later in the\nday, the same figure stood by, then sat on the edge of my mother's bed, and\nwas seen by both my sisters and the old servant, looking just as she had\nwhen alive, except that she wore a grey dress, and, as far as we could re\nmember, she had always worn black. My mother saw her, for she turned\ntowards her and said, 'Mary'\u2014her name.\"\nWe have verified the date of death through the Register at Somerset\nHouse.\nMrs. B has had several other hallucinatory experiences,\u2014e.g., in 1876,\nin an Italian church, she saw an apparition of a child, which had been pointed\n\fXVII.] 373\nPhantasms of the Dead.\nout to her by her little daughter, then aged three, but was invisible to a\nfriend who accompanied her. It disappeared, and immediately afterwards\nthe body of a dead child, resembling the figure they had seen, was brought\ninto the church. The friend who was with Mrs. B. is now dead, so that no\ncorroboration can be obtained, her daughter not being able to remember the\nincident. Most of Mrs. B.'s other experiences were, so far as can be\nascertained, purely subjective.\nMr. Podmore, who visited Mr. and Mrs. B. on April 8th, 1893, writes:\u2014\nApril lOf\/t, 1893.\n\" Mrs. B. gave me a full account of her vision of her mother. She\nhad absolutely no cause for anxiety, the last news being that her\nmother was better than she had been for years. There was a chronic ail\nment, but no reason to anticipate death soon. The children were too young\nto remember it, but Mr. B. told me that he came in a few minutes later and\ncomforted his wife, whilst she was crying on the sofa. A written note of the\ndate was taken and compared with the date given in the letter afterwards\nreceived, but all memoranda and letters of that time were lost. Both Mr.\nand Mrs. B. are satisfied of the coincidence of the vision with the day of the\nfuneral.\"\nIn the following case the hallucination occurred shortly after the\ndeath, \u2014perhaps within 24 hours of it,\u2014and the apparition indi\ncated leave-taking. It is an interesting example (the only one in\nthe Census) of a pritnd facie veridical hallucination coinciding\nwith the arrival of a letter bearing on the subject. Another re\nmarkable feature in the case is the persistent repetition of the\npercept.\n(740. 9.) From Miss E. L. M.\n(The account was written in 1889. )\n\" On the morning of January 14th, 1876, I was in the B. schoolroom, a\nsmall village near to A. in Hants, when I saw what appeared to me to be a\nfavourite cousin. She was close beside me, and appeared in good health, as\nI had every reason to suppose her to be. I should here explain that I held\nin my hand a letter which had just been brought to me, mid which I luid ioot\nyet opened, telling me that my cousin was seriously ill with scarlet fever.\nThe fact was that at the time she was actually dead, her death having\noccurred after the posting of the letter. I was waiting for children to\nassemble in school, and was in good health and in no grief or anxiety.\nI knew immediately that it was my cousin whom I saw, and believed her\nto be at the time at her own home. I could not understand what she meant\nby saying ' Good-bye,' which I cannot say I heard, but saw by the move\nment of her lips.\n' ' The village children and my sister [were present]. The former I have\nno reason to think saw anything, and my sister only laughed at me.

Though very ill at the time (consumption), her cheeks were brightly\nflushed, her hair about her shoulders, and she had a very pleasant expression.\nThe room was quite dark, but she was distinctly visible to me. I was a child\nof nine years old and in good health. I knew that my aunt was ill, having left\nher but a short time before. My mother was beside me in bod, and before\nI called to her, she had been wakened by what she described as something\nvery cold touching her shoulder, but she saw nothing.\"\nMiss M. writes later :\u2014\nNovember 8th, 1889.\n\" My aunt did die the very same night that I saw the vision of her. We\nwere living about a quarter of a mile from her. I cannot remember whether\nI was told of her death before, during, or directly after breakfast.\"\nMiss M.

It is possible that it may have been seen on the day\nof the death. as stated in the first account, but since the percipient finally\ncame to the conclusion that it was a day or two later, we have counted\nit as a phantasm of a dead person.\n(461. 25.) From Mr. H. F.

Farncombe, writes from notes taken at a per\nsonal interview with Mr. Dean :\u2014\n\" The date of Mr. 's death and of his appearance to his son-in-law\nwas June 9th, 1877. He died in Toronto, having been resident in Canada\nsome ten years. He had formerly lived in Birmingham, but had never met his\nson-in-law, and had never been in the house\u2014in Warstone-lane, Birmingham\n\u2014where the appearance was seen. Figure appeared in hall in the evening\u2014\nhall dark except for light from open door of sitting-room. Mr. Dean was\ncrossing (alone) from one room to the other when figure appeared and ad\nvanced, smiling, apparently as if going to speak to him, then vanished\ngradually. Mr. Dean says on seeing the figure he had an intuitive impres\nsion that it was his wife's father, with whose appearance he was familiar\nthrough having often talked it over with his wife. Ho noticed, however, a\nscar on his face which he had not heard of. Mr. Dean at once told his wife\nthat he had seen a figure which he thought was her father, but remarked\nthat he had a scar on his face (pointing to place) which she had never told him\nof. His wife said it was quite true\u2014was precisely in that position and had\nbeen caused by a lathe with which her father was experimenting. The\nfigure was seen by Mr. Dean only\u2014in good health and entirely free from\nanxiety. Mr. Dean does not know the precise hour of his father-in-law's\ndeath\u2014only that it was on the same day on which he saw the appearance.\nHe was not aware of his father-in-law's illness.\"\n[Mr. Dean's signature is here added, certifying that he had read the\naccount and that it was correct.]\nMr. Farncombe continues :\u2014\n\" Mr. Dean impresses me as being thoroughly straightforward, and of an\nintelligence distinctly above his class\u2014that of a somewhat superior working-\nman.

[chap.\nThese apparitions of the dead when the death is unknown may be\ncompared\u2014from an evidential point of view\u2014with cases where an\napparition occurs during the fatal illness of the person seen, the illness\nbeing unknown to the percipient. For in both these kinds of cases\nalike there is a coincidence of a hallucination with an unknown and\nimportant new phase in the condition of the person represented ; while\nin both alike the probability of the coincidence occurring by chance is\ngreater than in death-coincidences, in proportion to the greater length\nof the period over which the new phase extends.\nBesides these cases where the percipient did not know of the\ndeath, there are a number of cases occurring very soon\u2014but more than\n1 2 hours\u2014after a known death. These may be ranked with the cases,\nabout equally numerous, of apparitions occurring during known illness\nwhich proved fatal. About one-fifth out of the whole number of phan\ntasms of the dead, whose distance in time from the death has been\nreported to us, occurred within the week after death ; another third\noccurred within the year after death.\nIf now we survey together the various groups of phantasms of the\nliving and of the dead which we have been comparing in detail, we see\nthat there is a marked accumulation of cases about the time of the\ndeath. They occur during fatal illness, whether this is known or un\nknown to the percipient, in increasing frequency as the death ap\nproaches,\u2014the largest number being reported as happening at or about\nthe time of the death itself. Then they continue to occur after the\ndeath, whether the fact of the death is known or unknown to the\npercipient, becoming rarer as the death recedes into the distance. The\ndeath thus forms a central point about which the hallucinations cluster,\ndiminishing in number on each side of it : and this certainly suggests\nthat there is no discontinuity at the moment of death,\u2014no sudden\ntransition from a state in which communication with the living is\npossible to a state to which it is not.\nAnd this suggestion is strengthened when we observe how little\nsupport is given by our statistics for the assumption that either\nanxiety about illness or grief for death has an important effect on the\nwhole number of apparitions that occur when the person represented\nis ill or recently dead. If, for instance, we take the cases of appari\ntions occurring during the fatal illness of the person represented, but\nnot within 12 hours of the death, we find that the illness was in\n7 cases out of 18 unknown to the percipient. It is a still more\nstriking fact that in 10 out of the 17 cases of apparitions within 12\nhours after the death of the person represented, the fact of the\ndeath was unknown to the percipient ; in 4 of these 10 cases it was\nnot even known that the person was ill, and only in 2 of the 6 cases\nin which the person was known to be ill, but not known to be dead,\n\fXVII.] 377\nPhantasms of the Dead.\nwas there any serious anxiety about the illness. In view of these\nfacts, the regular rise and fall in the number on each side of the\ndeath becomes a still more impressive phenomenon.\nPromises to Appear after Death.\nAnother argument\u2014to which perhaps some weight should be allowed\n\u2014for the continuity of the states before, at, and after death may be\nderived from the apparent fulfilment of promises to try to appear or\ncommunicate after death. We made no special enquiry alxiut such\npromises, and have therefore no reason to think that we have complete\ninformation either as to the number made or the proportion fulfilled.\nWe have, however, some facts of interest. Promises are mentioned in\nthree of the 80 cases of death-coincidences - namely, Nos. 362. 21\n(p. 217), 215. 9 (p. 224), \u2014in both of which the apparition is stated to\nhave been seen at the time of death,\u2014and No 379. 24 (p. 225), where\nit was seen half-an-hour after the death. A promise is also mentioned\nin one of the 9 cases of apparitions after death, the death being un\nknown to the percipient : viz., No. 442. 15 (p. 371), where the person\nseen had been dead a week ; and also in one of the 1 1 cases of appari\ntions during fatal illness\u2014the approach of death being unknown to the\npercipient\u2014namely, No. 402. 8 (p. 284), where the apparition occurred\ntwo days before the death, during extreme weakness, and probably\nduring sleep, of the slowly dying person.\nNow we may probably assume that neither 5 persons in 100 nor 3\npersons in 80 of all classes, sexes, and ages make promises to appear\nif possible to their friends after death : and if so, we may infer that\nthe occurrence of this number of compacts among primdfacie veridical\ncases is not due to chance alone. If it is not accidental, the promise\nand the apparition must be in some way causally connected. But in\nthe cases referred to, it seem improbable that the connection depends\non the state of the percipient ; since,\u2014as the death or near approach of\ndeath was in all the 5 cases unknown to the percipients,\u2014they could\nhardly be at the time expectant of the fulfilment of the promise. We\nseem then almost driven to suppose that the efficacy of the promise\ndepended on the state of the dead or dying person. If this be so, we\nseem to have in the cases of fulfilment of a promise to communicate\u2014\ngrouped as they are about the time of death and on either side of it\u2014\na further indication that there is for the dying person no abrupt transi\ntion at death.\nThere are 5 other cases in the Census of such promises fulfilled\u20143\nof them visual, 1 auditory, and 1 auditory and tactile\u2014the interval\nafter death varying from a few months to 5 years. The following is\none of them.\n\f378 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\n(573. 20.) From Miss E. M. T.\nSeptember Uth, 1891.\n\"I awoke from sleep and saw a brother who had been dead more than\nfive years standing at the foot of my bed. He stood still, gazing at me\nearnestly. I cannot remember a voice, but he distinctly conveyed to my\nmind the impression that I was to have no more anxiety and that all would\nbe for the best. I said ' Oh, Arthur!' and jumped up to go to him, when he\nvanished. This took place [on] a bright, sunny morning about 4.30 a.m.\nin June, 1872. No one was present. I was in perfect health ; but we had\nfamily trouble at the time. I was 28. My brother in life had said he would\nappear after death if possible. \"\nMiss T. adds :\u2014\n\" I have not seen him again ; but, previously, at the time of his death, in.\n1867, I had a dream in which I thought I was wandering over a sort of wild\ncountry and could find him nowhere. I awoke, crying, feeling he was lost.\nThe dream made such an impression on me that I made a note of it at the\ntime. My brother was in Ceylon. I was in England. About five weeks\nafterwards we heard of his death in the early morning of the day I had the\ndream. Just before he died he called my name loudly.\n\" I have had other sensations of a spiritual presence at times, but have\nactually seen nothing definite at any other time.\"\nOf course, in cases such as this where the death is known, we have\nno argument from coincidence tending to exclude the purely subjective\naction of the percipient's mind ; and the fact of the promise may, by\nproducing some degree of expectancy, have helped both to cause and\nto shape the phantasm. On the other hand, it will be observed that\nthe number of apparitions fulfilling promises after the death is other\nwise known to the percipient is only equal to the number of similar\nfulfilments where there was no such knowledge.\nInformation Conveyed by Phantasms of the Dead.\nLeaving the evidence supplied by the distribution of phantasms of\nthe dead and by their occurrence when the death was unknown,\nwe may consider next those which convey true information to the\npercipient about facts unknown to him. Three of the cases already\ndiscussed belong to this class ; in two of which (No. 442. 15 and No.\n740. 9, pp. 371 and 373) the information was as to the fact of the\ndeath, while in the third it related to a scar on the face (No. 461. 25,\np. 374). In the following case there is a veridical feature of this kind,\nbut it is perhaps one that might more easily have been guessed.\n(579. 23) From Mr. Heintze.\n2, Rue Pouchkine, St. Petersburg.\n\" C'\u00e9tait a Moscou, vers le 15 Avril, 1884.

Je n'\u00e9tais pas en \u00e9tat de parler, la frayeur m'avait paralys\u00e9 la langue.\nL'apparition me tendit la main, machinalement je lui tendis la mienne ; sa\nmain n'avait pas le froid glacial d'un cadavre, elle \u00e9tait seulement fra\u00eeche.\nIl commen\u00e7a \u00e0 parler : sa voix \u00e9tait sourde, mais elle ressemblait \u00e0 la voix de\nmon p\u00e8re.\n\"Je ne puis citer ici les paroles, qui se rapportaient uniquement \u00e0 moi\net \u00e9taient d'un caract\u00e8re intime.

[chap.\nciding with the death of a friend, which has been counted among the\ndeath-coincidences.\nA few cases of apparitions of the dead predicting future events\nfall primd facie under the present heading ; but in most of them\nthe event is such as might have been guessed, as for instance when a\nparent in great anxiety for one child sees an apparition of another\ndead one who makes predictions as to the course of the illness\n(No. 91. 12) ; or when a second marriage is predicted by the\napparition of the deceased wife. In one case (No. 535. 1) where the\ndeceased wife appears to a friend at about the same time that the\nwidower had, unknown to the percipient, become engaged to marry\nagain, there is an element of coincidence which gives it some\nevidential character ; but the experience occurred rather more than\n20 years ago, and is uncorroborated, and, moreover, the coincidence\nis not stated to have been exact.\nThe most remarkable case in our collection of a phantasm of the\ndead conveying true information is perhaps the following. The\nphantasm not only gives information, but coincides in time with the\ndeath to which its apparent words and actions refer.\n(464. 15.) From Miss L. Dodson.\nSeptember Uth, 1891.\n\"On June 5th, 1887, a Sunday evening,1 between 11 and 12 at\nnight, being awake, my name was called three times. I answered twice,\nthinking it was my uncle, 'Come in, Uncle George, I am awake,' but the\nthird time I recognised the voice as that of my mother, who had been dead\n16 years. I said, ' Mamma ! ' She then came round a screen near my\nbedside with two children in her arms, and placed them in my arms and put\nthe bed-clothes over them and said, 'Lucy, promise me to take care of them,\nfor their mother is just dead.' I said, 'Yes, mamma.' She repeated,\n' Promise me to take care of them. ' I replied, ' Yes, I promise you ; ' and I\nadded ' Oh, mamma, stay and speak to me, I am so wretched.' She replied,\n' Not yet, my child,' then she seemed to go round the screen again, and I\nremained, feeling the children to be still in my arms, and fell asleep. When\nI awoke there was nothing. Tuesday morning, June 7th, I received the\nnews of my sister-in-law's death. She had given birth to a child three weeks\nbefore, which I did not know till after her death.\n\" I was in bed but not asleep, and the room was lighted by a gas-light\nin the street outside. I was out of health and in anxiety about family\ntroubles. My age was 42. I was quite alone I mentioned the circum\nstance to my uncle the next morning. He thought I was sickening for\nbrain fever.

It was dated, \" Bruges, June 7th,\n1887,\" and gave the date of death as June 5th. He quotes from Miss\nDodson's letter to him enclosing it, as follows :\u2014\" [My friend], Mrs.\nGrange, tells me she saw [my sister-in-law] a couple of hours prior to her\ndeath, which took place about 9 o'clock on the evening of June 5th, and it\nwas between 11 and 12 o'clock the same night my mother brought me the\ntwo little children.\"\nProfessor Sidgwick writes :\u2014\nNovember 23rd, 1892.\n\" I have just had an interesting conversation with Miss Dodson and her\nfriend, Mrs. Grange.\n\"Miss Dodson told me that she was not thinking of her brother or his\nwife at this time, as her mind was absorbed by certain other matters. But\nthe brother was an object of special concern to her, as her mother on her\ndeath bed, in 1871, had specially charged her\u2014and she had promised\u2014to take\ncare of the other children, especially this brother, who was then 5 years old.\nHe had married in April 1885, and she had not seen him since, though she\nhad heard of the birth of his first child, a little girl, in January 1886 ; and\nshe had never seen his wife, nor heard of the birth of the second child.\n\"She is as sure as she can be that she was awake at the time of the\nexperience. She knew the time by a clock in the room and also a clock out\nside. She heard this latter strike 12 afterwards, and the apparition must have\noccurred after 11, because lights were out in front of the public-house. The\nchildren seemed to be with her a long time ; indeed they seemed to be still\nwith her when the clock struck 12. The room was usually light enough to\nsee things in\u2014e.g., to get a glass of water, &c.\u2014owing to the lamp in the\nstreet, but the distinctness with which the vision was seen is not explicable\nby the real light. The children were of ages corresponding to those of her\nsister-in-law's children : i.e., they seemed to be a little girl and a baby newly\nborn : the sex was not distinguished. She was not at all alarmed.\n\f382 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\n\" She heard from Mrs. Grange by letter, and afterwards orally from her\nbrother, that her sister-in-law died between 8 and 9 the same night.\n\" She never had any experience of the kind, or any hallucination\nat all before : but since she has occasionally felt a hand on her head in\ntrouble.\n\" Mrs. Grange told me that she was with the sister-in-law about an hour\nand a half before her death. She left her about 7 o'clock, without any\nparticular alarm about her ; though she was suffering from inflammation after\nchildbirth, and Mrs. Grange did not quite like her look ; still her state was\nnot considered alarming by those who were attending on her. Then about\n8.30 news came to Mrs. Grange in her own house that something had happened\nat the sister-in-law's. As it was only in the next street, Mrs. Grange put on\nher bonnet and went round to the house, and found she was dead. She then\nwrote and told Miss Dodson.\"\nThere are some phantasms of the dead which by their appropriate\nness suggest that the deceased are taking a continued interest in\nmundane affairs. The case just given is one of these, and is perhaps\nthe strongest in the present collection. It is, however, seldom possible\nin such cases to eliminate other possible causes and thus prove the\nagency of the dead. In the case just given, for instance, a telepathic\nimpulse from the living brother might conceivably embody itself for\nthe percipient in the form of their mother. Where no information is\ngiven by means of the phantasm, and its appropriateness depends\nsolely on the circumstances of the percipient at the time, it is, of\ncourse, easy to suppose that the whole experience was purely sub\njective. For instance, in the following experience of the percipient of\na well-evidenced death-coincidence (see p. 211) his aunt plays the part\nof a guardian angel pointing out to him the way to escape from danger.\nBut it is not improbable that the suggestion came solely from his own\nmind, assuming a hallucinatory form owing to his emotional condition,\nas in the cases quoted in Chapter IX., pp. 169\u2014170.\n(425. 12.) From Mr. S. Walker Anderson.\n[The account was given verbally to Professor Sidgwick, who writes from\nnotes taken at the time of his interview :\u2014]\nDecember 19th, 1891.\n\" Mr. Anderson has seen an apparition of one of his aunts, who had died\nmany years before, several times in a dream-like and half shadowy way,\nimmediately after waking up from a dream. Once only he saw her more\ncompletely externalised. This was seven years ago next January, when he\nwas in danger of his life crossing a river in Queensland. His horse was\ncarried down the stream, unable to swim across : he gave himself up for lost,\nwhen he saw his aunt standing on a floating tree ; he felt it to be an indica\ntion that he was to leave the horse and seize hold of the tree, which he did,\nand was carried safe to the bank.\"\n\fPhantasms of the Dead. 383\nIn the case we have next to quote\u2014unless we accept the hypothesis\nof chance-coincidence\u2014the evidence for the agency of the dead is\ncertainly strong, because any other explanation compatible with the\nveracity of the narrators requires a very complicated and improbable\nhypothesis as regards the sub-conscious action of Senhor Cabral's mind.\nThe case came into our collection merely as a tactile hallucination :\nbut the main interest of it depends on the coincident experience of\nDonna Feliciana Fortes. It seems doubtful from the account given\nwhether she had a hallucinatory vision, or merely a mental vision,\nbut for our present purpose this is unimportant.\n(726. 14.) From Senhor Ulysses J. C.

I\nescorted them thither, and returned to attend to my obligations in the city.\nIn order not to be alone, I accepted the invitation of my friend, Barboza de\nAndrade, and went to live with him in S. Christovam. One month after\nwards, a sister of Barboza's, who was ill, came into his house. She grew\ndaily worse, and after the lapse of a few months had sunk so low that we\nhad to sit up with her at night.\n\" One night, when I had taken my turn at nursing, I felt sleepy, and\nwent to lie down. Two sisters, Donnas Anna Ignez Dias Fortes and\nFebciana Dias (now deceased), took my place. I had made their ac\nquaintance but a few days before. After stretching myself on the bed,\nI was filled with a feeling of unbounded joy. I was happy, and could not\nimagine what was the cause of my happiness. I had a sensation as if some\none were holding my head and placing something round it.\n\" Astonished at my experience, I called to the ladies who were watching\nin the next room, and Donna Feliciana, though from the place where she\nwas seated she could not see me, answered me back, ' I see at your bedside\na spirit child clothed in white. She places on your head a crown of roses.\nShe says her name is Deolinda, and she comes to thank you for the kindness\nand charity with which you behaved to her.' I was amazed at such a\ndeclaration, for that very day was the anniversary of Deolinda's death, and\nneither I nor any other person in the house had recollected this.1 Besides,\nI had never spoken on the subject.\n\" The two ladies were worthy of the highest respect.

He supposed\nat first that a towel had in some way wound itself round his head. He did\nnot speak of this sensation to the ladies in the next room. The ecstatic\nfeeling would not allow him to sleep when he lay down. It was on the\nnight of the anniversary of the child's death, about 12 o'clock, that this\noccurred. Senhor Cabral believed that he had not spoken of Deolinda\nto the people of the house, and this is confirmed, if there are no lapses\nof memory, by the statements of the other persons concerned. He thought\nthat the lustre of his deed of charity would be somewhat tarnished if told\neven to friends. Though at my request he has made the whole incident\npublic, he does so, I am well assured, with the intention of helping us in\na quest which he holds to be all-important. Both he and Donna Anna\nFortes affirm that they came together in that house for the first time on\nthat night, although they had met once or twice before at Spiritist sittings.\nThe lady says they were conversing about Spiritism at the time of Senhor\nCabral's experience.\n\"Donna Feliciana Fortes, now dead, was a remarkable sensitive,\naccording to the accounts I have received of her by surviving friends.\n\" The witnesses to the above case are all Spiritists; but they are people\nin whose veracity I can trust implicitly.\n\" Alfred Alexander.\"\nIf we are to exclude Deolinda's agency here, we must suppose that\nSenhor Cabral was sub-consciously aware that it was the anniversary\nof her death, and that this subconscious recollection produced by\nassociation the feeling of happiness and the tactile hallucination, with\nout even then influencing his conscious memory ; and, further, that the\nother witnesses were affected by telepathic influence from his uncon-\n1 \"They were sleeping at the time, and only heard of it the next day.\u2014A.

This is certainly a highly strained hypothesis ; and a\nfew more well-evidenced cases of this sort would go far to establish\nthe agency of the dead.\nIn the following case, the interest lies in the simultaneous appear\nance to two percipients who were not together, \u2014-a coincidence which\nit is difficult to regard as fortuitous, however it may be explained.\n(402. 19.) From Baron B. von Driesen.\nThe account was written in November, 18!t3, and has been translated\nfrom the Russian by the collector, Mr. M. Petrovo Solovovo.\n\" [Baron von Driesen begins by saying that he has never believed and does\nnot believe in the supernatural, and that he is more inclined to attribute the\napparition he saw to his ' excited fancy ' than to anything else. After these\npreliminary remarks he proceeds as follows :\u2014]\n\" I must tell you that my father-in-law, M N. J. Ponomareff,\ndied in the country. This did not happen at once, but after a long and\npainful illness, whose sharp phases had obliged my wife and myself to join\nhim long before his death. I had not been on good terms with M.\nPonomareff Different circumstances which are out of place in this narrative\nhad estranged us from each other, and these relations did not change until\nhis death. He died very quietly, after having given his blessing to all his\nfamily, including myself. A liturgy for the rest of his soul was to be eel*\nbrated on the ninth day. I remember very well how I went to bed between\none and two o'clock on the eve of that day and how I read the Gospel before\nfalling asleep. My wife was sleeping in the same room. It was perfectly\nquiet. I had just put out the candle when footsteps were heard in the\nadjacent room\u2014a sound of slippers shuffling, I might say\u2014which ceased\nbefore the door of our bedroom. I called out, ' Who is there ? ' No answer.\nI struck one match, then another, and when after the stifling smell of the\nsulphur the fire had lighted up the room, I saw M. Ponomareff standing\nbefore the closed door. Yes, it was he, in his blue dressing-gown, lined with\nsquirrel furs and only half-buttoned, so that I could see his white waistcoat\nand his black trousers. It was he undoubtedly. I was not frightened. They\nsay that, as a rule, one is not frightened when seeing a ghost, as ghosts\npossess the quality of paralysing fear.\n\"'What do you want?' I asked my father-in-law. M. Ponomareff\nmade two steps forward, stopped before my bed, and said, ' Basil Feodorovitch,\nI have acted wrongly towards you. Forgive me ! Without this I do not feel\nat rest there.' He was pointing to the ceiling with his left hand whilst\nholding out his right to me. I seized this hand, which was long and cold,\nshook it and answered, ' Nicholas Ivanovitch, God is my witness that I\nhave never had anything against you.'\n\" [The ghost of] my father-in-law bowed [or bent down], moved away and\nwent through the opposite door into the billiard-room, where he disappeared.\nI looked after him for a moment, crossed myself, put out the candle, and\nfell asleep with the sense of joy which a man who has done his duty must\nfeel. The morning came. My wife's brothers, as well as our neighbours\nand the peasants, assembled, and the liturgy was celebrated by our con\n2 c\n\f386 [chap.\nReport on the Census of Hallucinations.\nfeasor, the Rev. Father Basil. But when all was over, the same Father\nBasil led me aside and said to me mysteriously, ' Basil Feodorovitch, I have\ngot something to say to you in private.' My wife having come near us at\nthis moment, the clergyman repeated his wish. I answered, ' Father Basil,\nI have no secrets from my wife ; please tell us what you wished to tell me\nalone. '\n\"Then Father Basil, who is living till now in the Koi parish of the\ndistrict of Kashin [Gov. of Tver], said to me in a rather solemn voice, ' This\nnight at three o'clock Nicholas Ivanovitch [Ponomareff] appeared to me and\nbegged of me to reconcile him to you.'\n\"(Signed) Baron Basil Driesen.\"\nMr. Solovovo adds :\u2014\n\" The Baroness von Driesen is now dead, so that her evidence cannot be\nobtained. ...\n' ' I also saw Baron Basil von Driesen himself, and spoke with him\nabout M. Ponomareff's ghost. He stated to me that if he were going to\ndie to-morrow he should still be ready to swear to the fact of his having\nseen the apparition, or something to this effect. I asked him to obtain for\nme the clergyman's account, to whom I had already written before seeing\nBaron von Driesen (though not knowing him), but without receiving an\nanswer\u2014which is but natural, after all. Baron von Driesen kindly promised\nto procure for me the account in question, as it was then his intention to\nvisit different estates in Central Russia, including the one that had belonged\nto M. Ponomareff.\n\"Baron Nicholas von Driesen\u2014Baron Basil's son\u2014called on me a few\ndays ago. He stated, with regard to the case in question, that it was\nnecessary to see the clergyman in order to induce him to write an account\nof what had happened to him.\"\nBaron N. von Driesen afterwards sent a note to Mr. Solovovo, stating\nthat his grandfather [M. Ponomareff] died on November 21st, 1860 ; and\nthe testimony of the priest was obtained later. Mr. Solovovo, who had\nalready ascertained independently that the Rev. Basil Bajenoff had been\na priest at Koi in the year 1861, and was there still, writes :\u2014\n'' The following is the translation of the Rev. Basil BajenofTs statement :\u2014\n' Koi, Jvly 2Zrd [Augmt 4tfi], 1891.\n\" ' To the account I heard from Baron B. F. Driesen in the presence of\nhis wife's brothers, MM. N. N., A. N., and I. N. Ponomareff, as to how\nM. Nicholas I. Ponomareff appeared to him in the night of November\n29-30th, 1860, having died nine days before, and begged of the Baron to\nbe reconciled to him, I may add that to me also did he appear at the same\ntime and with the same request, which fact, before hearing the Barons\nnarrative, I communicated to all those present at the Liturgy for the rest\nof the soul of the late M. N. I. Ponomareff.\n' ' ' (Signed) Basil Bajenoff,\n\" ' Priest of Trinity Church, at Koi, District of Kashin,\nGovernment of Tver.' \"\nBaron von Driesen had previously, in 1855, had another apparently\nveridical experience. At the hour of the death of a brother-in-law, who\n\fXVII.] 387\nPhantasms of the Dead.\n\u25a0was living in another place, and whom he believed to be in good health, he\nheard a voice saying ; \" Pray ; your brother-in-law is dead.\"\nWe may conclude our examination of phantasms of the dead with\nanother Russian case, apparently carefully observed, and presenting\nseveral points of interest, among which is a incident somewhat resemb\nling the one just discussed.\n(422. 22.) From Mr. E. Mamtchitch.\nSt. Petersburg, April 29th, 1891.\n\" Comme il s'agira des apparitions de Palladia, je dois dire auparavant\nquelques mots sur sa personne. Elle \u00e9tait la fille d'un riche propri\u00e9taire russe,\nmort un mois avant sa naissance. Sa m\u00e8re, dans son d\u00e9s\u00e9spoir, voua son\nenfant futur au couvent. De l\u00e0 son nom, usit\u00e9 parmi les religieuses. Deux\nans apr\u00e8s, sa m\u00e8re mourut, et l'orpheline, jusqu' \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 14 ans, fut \u00e9lev\u00e9e\ndans un couvent de Moscou par sa tante, qui en \u00e9tait la sup\u00e9rieure.\n\"En 1870, \u00e9tant encore \u00e9tudiant \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9 de Moscou, je fis la\nconnaissance du fr\u00e8re de Palladia, \u00e9tudiant comme moi, et il fut souvent\nquestion entre nous de rendre \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 la nonne malgr\u00e9 soi; mais ce\nplan ne fut r\u00e9alis\u00e9 qu'en 1872. J'\u00e9tais venu en \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 Moscou, pour voir\nl'exposition, et j'y rencontrai par hasard le fr\u00e8re de Palladia. J'appris qu'il\n\u00e9tait en train de l'envoyer en Crim\u00e9e pour cause de sant\u00e9, et je le secondai\nde mon mieux. C'est alors que je vis Palladia pour la premi\u00e8re fois ;\nelle avait 14 ans; quoique haute de.taille, elle \u00e9tait fort ch\u00e9tive et d\u00e9j\u00e0\npoitrinaire. A la pri\u00e8re de son fr\u00e8re, j'accompagnai Palladia et sa s\u0153ur,\nMme. P. S., en Crim\u00e9e, o\u00f9 elles rest\u00e8rent pour passer l'hiver, et moi, deux\nsemaines apr\u00e8s, je revins \u00e0 Kieff.\n\" En \u00e9t\u00e9 1873 je rencontrai par hasard Palladia et sa s\u0153ur \u00e0 Odessa, o\u00f9\nelles \u00e9taient venues pour consulter les m\u00e9decins, quoique Palladia avait\nl'air de se porter assez bien. Le 27 Ao\u00fbt, pendant que je faisais la lec\nture aux deux dames, Palladia mourut subitement d'un an\u00e9vrisme, \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge\nde 15 ans.\n\"Deux ans apr\u00e8s la mort de Palladia, en 1875, me trouvant \u00e0 Kieff, il\nm'arriva, par une soir\u00e9e du mois de D\u00e9cembre, d'assister pour la premi\u00e8re\nfois \u00e0 une s\u00e9ance spiritique; j'entendis des coups dans la table; cela ne\nm'\u00e9tonna nullement, car j'\u00e9tait s\u00fbr que c'\u00e9tait une plaisanterie. De retour\nchez moi, je voulus voir si les m\u00eames coups se produiraient chez moi ; je\nme mis dans la m\u00eame pose, les mains sur la table. Bient\u00f4t des coups\nse firent entendre. Imitant le proc\u00e9d\u00e9 dont j'avais \u00e9t\u00e9 le t\u00e9moin, je com\nmen\u00e7ai \u00e0 r\u00e9citer l'alphabet; le nom de Palladia me fut indiqu\u00e9. Je fus\n\u00e9tonn\u00e9, presque effray\u00e9; ne pouvant me tranquilliser, je me mis de nouveau\n\u00e0 la table, et je demandai \u00e0 Palladia, qu'avait-elle \u00e0 me dire 1 La r\u00e9ponse fut :\n* Replacer l'ange, il tombe.' Je ne compris pas de suite de quoi il s'agissait.\nLe fait est qu'elle est enterr\u00e9e \u00e0 Kieff, et j'avais entendu dire qu'on voulait\nmettre un monument sur sa tombe, mais je n'y avais jamais \u00e9t\u00e9, et je ne\nsavais pas de quel genre \u00e9tait le monument. Apr\u00e8s cette r\u00e9ponse, je ne me\ncouchai plus, et d\u00e8s que le jour parut je me rendis au cimeti\u00e8re. Non sans\npeine, avec l'aide du gardien, je d\u00e9couvris enfin la tombe enfouie sous la\n2 C 2\n\f388 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nneige. Je m'arr\u00eatai stup\u00e9fi\u00e9: la statue en marbre de l'ange avec une croix\n\u00e9tait tout \u00e0 fait de c\u00f4t\u00e9.\n\"Depuis ce moment, il me fut prouv\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9vidence qu'il y a un autre\nmonde avec lequel, je ne sais comment, nous pouvons entrer en rapport, et\ndont les habitants peuvent nous donner de telles preuves de leur existence\nqu'elles d\u00e9sarment le scepticisme le plus tenace.\n\" En Octobre, 1876, je me trouvais \u00e0 Kieff, et j'\u00e9tais eu train de m'installer\ndans un nouveau logement (rue Pror\u00e9snaya) avec mon camarade de service\nau Minist\u00e8re de la Justice, M. Potolof. On venait de m'apporter un\npianino. Il fut plac\u00e9 dans la salle, et je me mis \u00e0 jouer; il \u00e9tait \u00e0 peu\npr\u00e8s 8 h. du soir; la salle o\u00f9 je jouais \u00e9tait \u00e9clair\u00e9e par une lampe pendue\nau mur. A c\u00f4t\u00e9 se trouvait mon cabinet de travail, \u00e9clair\u00e9 aussi par une\nlampe. Je me rappelle tr\u00e8s bien que j'\u00e9tais de fort bonne humeur. Mon\ncamarade, M. Potolof, \u00e9tait occup\u00e9 \u00e0 sa table, \u00e0 l'autre bout du logis. Toutes\nles portes \u00e9taient ouvertes, et de sa place il pouvait voir tr\u00e8s bien le cabinet\net la salle o\u00f9 je jouais.1 Jetant un regard vers la porte de mon cabinet de\ntravail, je vis tout \u00e0 coup Palladia. Elle se tenait au milieu de la porte, un\npeu de c\u00f4t\u00e9, avec le visage tourn\u00e9 vers moi. Elle me regardait tran\nquillement. Elle avait la m\u00eame robe fonc\u00e9e qu'elle portait lorsqu'elle\nmourut en ma pr\u00e9sence. Sa main droite pendait librement. Je voyais\ndistinctement ses \u00e9paules et sa taille, mais ne me rappelle pas du bas de\nson habit, et avais-je vu les pieds ? \u2014peut-\u00eatre, parce que tout le temps\nje lui regardais dans les yeux. En la voyant, j'avais tout \u00e0 fait oubli\u00e9 que\nje voyais devant moi non une personne vivante, mais morte, tellement\nje la voyais distinctement ; elle \u00e9tait \u00e9clair\u00e9e de deux c\u00f4t\u00e9s ; et d'autant\nplus j'ai la vue tr\u00e8s bonne. Ma premi\u00e8re sensation fut un frisson dans\nle dos. Je fus comme p\u00e9trifi\u00e9 et ma respiration fut suspendue ; mais ce\nn'\u00e9tait pas un effet caus\u00e9 par la frayeur ou l'excitation,\u2014c'\u00e9tait quelque chose\nd'autre. Je puis comparer cela \u00e0 la sensation que j'\u00e9prouve quand je\nregarde en bas d'une grande hauteur; je sens alors une terrible anxi\u00e9t\u00e9\net en m\u00eame temps je ne puis me retenir de regarder, quelque chose m'attire\ninvinciblement. Combien de temps Palladia resta devant moi, je ne saurais\nle dire, mais je me rappelle qu'elle fit un mouvement \u00e0 droite et disparut\nderri\u00e8re la porte du cabinet du travail. Je me pr\u00e9cipitai vers elle, mais\ndans la porte je m'arr\u00eatai, car alors seulement je me rappelai qu'elle \u00e9tait\nd\u00e9j\u00e0 morte, et je craignai d'entrer, \u00e9tant s\u00fbr de la revoir. Dans ce monient\nmon camarade vint \u00e0 moi et me demanda qu'est-ce que j'avais \u00ee Je lui\ndis ce qui venait de se passer ; alors nous entr\u00e2mes au cabinet, o\u00f9 nous ne\ntrouv\u00e2mes personne. Mon camarade, ayant entendu la brusque interruption\nde mon jeu, avait lev\u00e9 la t\u00eate et, tant que je me rappelle, disait avoir\nvu aussi quelqu'un passer devant la porte de mon cabinet; mais, voyant\nmon excitation, il me dit, pour me tranquilliser, que probablement c'\u00e9tait\nNikita, mon domestique, qui \u00e9tait venu arranger la lampe. Nous all\u00e2mes\nimm\u00e9diatement dans sa chambre, il n'y \u00e9tait pas; il \u00e9tait en bas, dans la\ncuisine, o\u00f9 il pr\u00e9parait le samovar. Voil\u00e0 comment je vis Palladia pour\nla premi\u00e8re fois, trois ans apr\u00e8s sa mort.\n1 A plan enclosed shows a suite of four rooms, M. Potolof's study, the ante\nroom, the drawing-room, and M. Mamtchitch's study, all opening into one another,\nthe three doors between thorn being in one straight line.\n\fPhantasms of the Dead.\n\"Apr\u00e8s la premi\u00e8re apparition de Palladia, en Octobre, 1876, et jusqu'\u00e0\npr\u00e9sent, je la vois souvent. Il arrive que je la vois trois fois par semaine,\nou deux fois le m\u00eame jour, ou bien un mois se passe sans la voir. En\nr\u00e9sum\u00e9, voil\u00e0 les traits principaux de ces apparitions.\n\"(1.) Palladia apparait toujours d'une fa\u00e7on inattendue, me prenant\ncomme par surprise, juste au moment quand j'y pense le moins.\n\"(2.) Quand je veux la voir moi-m\u00eame, j'ai beau y penser ou le vouloir- -\nelle n'apparait pas.\n\"(3.) A de rares exceptions, son apparition n'a aucun rapport avec le\ncourant de ma vie, comme pr\u00e9sage ou avertissement de quelqu' \u00e9v\u00e9nement\ninsolite.\n\" (4.) Jamais je ne la vois en songe.\n\" (5.) Je la vois \u00e9galement quand je suis seul, ou en grande compagnie.\n\"(9.) Elle m'apparait toujours avec la m\u00eame expression sereine des yeux;\n\u00abquelques fois avec un faible sourire. Elle ne m'a jamais parl\u00e9, \u00e0 l'exception\nde deux fois, que je vais raconter plus loin.\n\"(7.) Je la vois toujours dans la robe fonc\u00e9e qu'elle portait lorsqu'elle\nmourut sous mes yeux. Je vois distinctement son visage, sa t\u00e8te, les\n\u00e9paules et les bras, mais je ne vois pas ses pieds, ou plut\u00f4t je n'ai pas le\ntemps de les examiner.\n\"(8.) Chaque fois, en voyant Palladia inopin\u00e9ment, je perds la parole, je\nsens du froid dans le dos, je p\u00e2lis, je m'\u00e9crie faiblement, et ma respiration\ns'arr\u00eate (c'est ce que me disent ceux qui par hasard m'ont observ\u00e9 pendant\nce moment).\n\"(9.) L'apparition de Palladia se prolonge une, deux, trois minutes, puis\ngraduellement elle s'efface et se dissout dans l'espace.\n\" A pr\u00e9sent je vais d\u00e9crire trois cas d'apparitions de Palladia dont je\nme souviens bien.\n\"(1.) En 1879, \u00e0 la fin de Novembre, \u00e0 Kieff, j'\u00e9tais assis \u00e0 mon bureau \u00e0\n\u00e9crire un acte d'accusation ; il \u00e9tait 8\u00a3 du soir, la montre \u00e9tait devant moi\nsur la table. Je me h\u00e2tais de finir mon travail, car \u00e0 9h. je devais me\nrendre \u00e0 une soir\u00e9e. Tout \u00e0 coup, en face de moi, assise sur un fauteuil, je\nvis Palladia ; elle avait le coude du bras droit sur la table et la t\u00eate appuy\u00e9e\nsur la main. M'\u00e9tant remis de mon saisissement, je regardai la montre et je\nsuivis le mouvement de l'aiguille \u00e0 seconde, puis je relevai les yeux sur Pal\nladia ; je vis qu'elle n avait pas chang\u00e9 de pose et son coude se dessinait\nclairement sur la table. Ses yeux me regardaient avec joie et s\u00e9r\u00e9nit\u00e9 ;\nalors pour la premi\u00e8re fois je me d\u00e9cidai de lui parler : 'Que sentez-vous \u00e0\npr\u00e9sent ? ' lui demandai-je. Son visage resta impassible, ses l\u00e8vres, tant\nque je me rappelle, rest\u00e8rent immobiles, mais j'entendis distinctement sa\nvoix prononcer le mot, 'Qui\u00e9tude.' 'Je comprends,' lui r\u00e9pondis-je, et\neffectivement, en ce moment, je comprenais toute la signification qu'elle\navait mise dans ce mot. Encore une fois, pour \u00eatre s\u00fbr que je ne r\u00eavai pas,\nje regardai de nouveau la montre et je suivis les mouvements de l'aiguille \u00e0\nseconde ; je voyais clairement comme elle se mouvait. Ayant rapport\u00e9 mon\nregard sur Palladia, je remarquai qu'elle commen\u00e7ait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 s'effacer et dis\npara\u00eetre. Si je m'\u00e9tais avis\u00e9 de noter imm\u00e9diatement la signification du\nmot ' Qui\u00e9tude, ' ma m\u00e9moire aurait retenu tout ce qu'il y avait de nouveau\n\f390 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\net d'\u00e9trange. Mais \u00e0 peine avais-je quitt\u00e9 la table pour monter en haut,\nchez mon camarade Apouktine, avec lequel nous devions aller ensemble, que\nje ne pus lui dire autre chose que ce que je viens d'\u00e9crire.\n\"(2.) En 1885, je demeurais chez mes parents, \u00e0 une campagne du gou\nvernement de Poltava. Une dame de notre connaissance \u00e9tait venue passer\nchez nous quelques jours avec ses deux demoiselles. Quelque temps apr\u00e8s leur\narriv\u00e9e, m'\u00e9tant r\u00e9veill\u00e9 \u00e0 l'aube du jour, je vis Palladia (je dormais dans\nune aile s\u00e9par\u00e9e o\u00f9 j'\u00e9tais tout seul). Elle se tenait devant moi, \u00e0 cinq pas\n\u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s, et me regardait avec un sourire joyeux. S'\u00e9tant approch\u00e9e de\nmoi, elle me dit deux mots : 'J'ai \u00e9t\u00e9, j'ai vu,' et tout en souriant disparut.\nQue voulaient dire ces mots, je ne pus le comprendre. Dans ma chambre\ndonnait avec moi mon setter. D\u00e8s que j'aper\u00e7us Palladia, le chien h\u00e9rissa\nle poil et avec glapissement sauta sur mon lit ; se pressant vers moi, il\nregardait dans la direction o\u00f9 je voyais Palladia. Le chien n'aboyait pas,\ntandis que, ordinairement, il ne laissait personne entrer dans la chambre\nsans aboyer et grogner. Et toutes les fois, quand mon chien voyait Pal\nladia, il se pressait aupr\u00e8s de moi, comme cherchant un refuge. Quand\nPalladia disparut et je vins dans la maison, je ne dis rien \u00e0 personne de\ncette incident. Le soir du m\u00eame jour, la fille a\u00een\u00e9e de la dame qui se trouvait\nchez nous me raconta qu'une chose \u00e9trange lui \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9e ce matin :\n'M'\u00e9tant r\u00e9veill\u00e9e de grand matin,' me dit-elle, 'j'ai senti comme si\nquelqu'un se tenait au chevet de mon lit, et j'entendis distinctement une\nvoix me disant : \"Ne me crains pas, je suis bonne et aimante.\" Je tournai\nla t\u00eate, mais je ne vis rien ; ma m\u00e8re et ma s\u0153ur dormaient tranquillement;\ncela m'a fort \u00e9tonn\u00e9e, car jamais rien de pareil ne m'est arriv\u00e9.' Sur quoi je\nr\u00e9pondis que bien des choses inexplicables nous arrivent ; mais je ne lui dit\nrien de ce que j'avais vu le matin. Seulement un an plus tard, quand\nj'\u00e9tais d\u00e9j\u00e0 son fianc\u00e9, je lui fis part de l'apparition et des paroles de Pal\nladia le m\u00eame jour. N'\u00e9tait-ce pas elle qui \u00e9tait venue la voir aussi ? Je\ndois ajouter que j'avais vu alors cette demoiselle pour la premi\u00e8re fois et\nque je ne pensais pas du tout que j'allais l'\u00e9pouser.\n\"(3.) En Octobre, 1890, je me trouvais avec ma femme et mon fils, \u00e2g\u00e9 de\ndeux ans, chez mes anciens amis, les Strijewsky, \u00e0 leur campagne du\ngouvernement de Woron\u00e8je. Un jour, vers les 7h. du soir, rentrant de la\nchasse, je passai dans l'aile que nous habitions pour changer de toilette ;\nj'\u00e9tais assis dans une chambre \u00e9clair\u00e9e par une grande lampe.

Aksakoff.\"\n\f392 Report on the Census of Hallucinations. [chap.\nThe evidence for post mortem agency in this case depends mainly\non the communication received through raps at the seance, before any\napparition was seen at all, and the explanation of this belongs to a\nbranch of psychical research with which we are not concerned in the\npresent report. The simultaneous hallucinations, however, of Mr.\nMamtchitch and his future wife in different parts of the house also\nsuggest an agency external to both of them, just as the joint ex\nperiences of Baron von Driesen and the priest do, and for the same\nreason, though it is possible to explain the circumstance telepathically.\nThe occasionally collective character of Mr. Mamtchitch's hallucina\ntions we have already noticed in Chapter XV. One somewhat peculiar\nfeature of his experiences will have been observed, namely, that the\napparitions seem always to have been accompanied by a slightly\nabnormal physical condition, noticeable by the percipient and his\nfriends. This is unusual among the hallucinations reported to us,\nand must, in so far as there is any reason to think that' the physical\nstate may be a cause of the hallucination and not its consequence,\nbe held to support the view that the apparition is purely subjective.\nSumming up the results of this chapter, we have found that the\ndistribution of recognised apparitions before, at, and after the death\nof the person seen affords some argument for the continuity of psychical\nlife and the possibility of communication from the dead. We have\nfound further that the Census affords some remarkable cases which\nprimd facie are not purely subjective, and which suggest the action\nof the dead. The amount of evidence, however, does not appear to us\nin itself sufficient to constitute anything like a conclusive case for post\nmortem agency.\nConclusion.\nWith the discussion of Phantasms of the Dead we may regard our\ntask as terminated. For the extent to which we have taxed the\npatience of our readers we must plead as an excuse our wish not only\nto inform them of the views to which we have been led by the\nexamination of our voluminous returns, but also to lay before them,\nadequately if not completely, the evidence on which those views have\nbeen founded. Before concluding, it may be convenient that we\nshould retrace briefly the plan and course of our protracted discussion.\nWe began by explaining the point of view and method of our enquiry,\nand estimating as impartially as we could the effects of possible\n\fXVII.] 39-S\nConclusion.\nsources of error in its tabulated results. Then, in what we may call\nthe second part of the Report\u2014Chapters IV. to XI. inclusive\u2014we\nhave examined the light thrown by our returns on the main\n\u25a0characteristics of spontaneous sensory hallucinations, and on the\nmental and physical conditions favourable to their occurrence.\nThe remainder of our Report has been occupied with those among\nthe hallucinations reported to us whose characteristics may be thought\nto suggest an origin not purely subjective ; and especially those which\nafford evidence for telepathy. Among these the most important class\nis dealt with in Chapters XII. and XIII.,\u2014namely, apparitions which\n\u25a0coincide in time with the death of the person seen. These are the\nmost important, because they are the most numerous, and because they\nafford the means of estimating precisely the improbability of explana\ntion by chance. We have shown that\u2014after making the most ample\nallowance for all ascertainable sources of error\u2014 the number of these\nexperiences remains far greater than the hypothesis of chance-\ncoincidence will account for ; thus confirming the conclusions already\narrived at by Mr. Gurney in Phantasms of the Living (Chapter XIII.).\nIn Chapter XII. we have given a selection of the cases on which\nour calculation is based, in order to enable the reader to judge of\ntheir evidential quality. At the same time, we have been careful to\nexplain that this quality is very various, as inevitably follows from the\nmethod of collection ; since the answers to a comprehensive statistical\nenquiry into these experiences naturally includes, along with coinci\ndences carefully observed, a number of cases of real or alleged\ncoincidence in which the observation has been less careful and the\nreport accordingly less conclusive.\nIn Chapter XIV. we have presented the further evidence for\ntelepathy afforded by cases in which the improbability of chance\ncoincidence does not admit of the same exact calculation as that\ndiscussed in Chapter XII. ; although their cumulative force, in any\nfair estimate of the whole evidence, must be regarded as considerable.\nIn Chapter XV. we have discussed a class of experiences difficult\nto explain but of great theoretical interest\u2014collective hallucinations.\nWe do not present these as adding material support to the evidence\nfor telepathy ; but we think that, if telepathy be admitted as a vera\ncausa, it affords in many cases the most probable explanation of them.\nThen, in Chapter XVI., we have entered on still more dubious\nground. After briefly dealing with the comparatively slight amount\nof evidence for premonitory hallucinations which our Census affords, we\npassed to consider the more numerous cases of so-called \" hauntings.\"\nWe have endeavoured to estimate impartially, and illustrate by the\nmost noteworthy cases in the Census, the evidence tending to connect\nthe seeing of apparitions with certain localities ; but we have not\n\f394 Report on the Census of Hallucinations.\nfound any strong reasons for attributing phenomena of this kind tx>\nthe agency of the dead.\nStronger arguments, however, for accepting the possibility of\ncommunication from the dead to the living may be drawn from other\ncases included in our returns ; accordingly, in the final Chapter\n(XVII.) we have given careful consideration to these arguments,\nalthough we do not regard them as in themselves conclusive. We have\nendeavoured to estimate the kind and degree of support that the\nhypothesis of such communication appears to us to obtain from our\nstatistics as to the grouping of hallucinations about the crisis of death :\nand we have further laid before the reader the isolated cases which\nsuggest the conveyance of information from the dead.\nIn conclusion, we hope that our report will afford information of\nsome value on several questions relating to the casual hallucinations\nof sane and healthy persons. But undoubtedly the most important\npart of our work lies in the corroboration (in Chapters XII. and XIII.),\non a much wider basis, of the conclusion already drawn by Mr. Gurney\nfrom his Census in 1885. Between deaths and apparitions of tJie dying\nperson a connexion exists which is not due to chance alone. This we\nhold as a proved fact. The discussion of its full implications cannot\nbe attempted in this paper ;\u2014-nor perhaps, exhausted in this age.\nHenry Sidgwick.\nAlice Johnson.\nFrederic W. H.

The enquiry, begun in 1889, was approved\nby the Paris International Congress of Experimental Psychology, which\nentrusted it to Professor Sidgwick's direction. Explanation of plan of\nReport. Previous evidence for telepathy collected by the S.P.R. of two\nkinds,\u2014-experimental and spontaneous cases : a link between these types is.\nfurnished by experimental apparitions. Since \" non-coincidental \" as well\nas \" coincidental \" or \" veridical \" apparitions occur, it is necessary to find\nthe proportion of one kind of case to the other, in order to test whether\nthe number of coincidences is more than chance would produce. The\nattempt was first made by Mr. Gurney : the present enquiry is a develop\nment of his.

Proportion of collectors who have had hallucinations. Whether\nthe proportion of affirmative answers is diminished by experiences having\nbeen forgotten. Superficial forgetfulness : this has affected auditory and\ntactile hallucinations more than visual. Permanent forgetfulness shown\nby the numbers of visual hallucinations reported for recent periods being\ngreater than for remote periods, the numbers decreasing systematically as\nthe periods become more remote. The numbers of doubtfully hallucinatory\nexperiences are comparatively much larger in the recent periods. Inference\nthat to obtain the true number of visual hallucinations experienced since\nthe age of 10, the number reported must be multiplied by some number\nbetween 4 and Auditory and tactile hallucinations are forgotten more\nrapidly than visual ones.

In some bisensory cases, illusions may be combined\nwith hallucinations 94\u2014112\nChapter VI.\u2014Form and Development of Hallucination. Hallucinations\ntend to take familiar forms ; the great majority of visual hallucinations\nrepresent human beings, and more than two-fifths of these are living\npersons known to the percipient. The dress and movements of apparitions\nare also generally such as the percipient is accustomed to see. Modes\n\u25a0of appearance and disappearance of phantoms, with examples ; examples\noi metamorphoses ; of development from a cloud-like form to a clearly-\ndefined figure ; of a figure becoming transparent as it gradually disappears.\nDescription, with instances, of \"incompletely developed apparitions\":\u2014\na transparent figure; shrouded and veiled figures; a figure with an in\ndistinct face. A case of piecemeal development. Examples of fragmentary\nfigures ; hallucinations projected on flat surfaces, like pictures ; indefinite\nforms ; lights. Symbolic forms of hallucinations. Apparitions of animals,\nand of inanimate objects. Religious phantasms. Deferred recognition.\nA case of double recognition. Auditory and tactile hallucinations more\nrarely reported than visual, but partly, at least, because they are more\nforgotten. They are much less impressive; e.g., many cases of hearing\nname called ; but sometimes an aplwrition is combined with a voice.\nInstances of tactile hallucinations 113\u2014133\nChapter VII.\u2014Physiology of Hallucination*. No attempt made to\ndiscuss the physiological processes involved in veridical hallucinations as\n.such. Hallucinations may sometimes be initiated by the condition of\n\fContents. 397\nthe sense-organs ; e.g., the very rare ones that move with the eyes; and\nthose that occur during diseases of the sense-organs ; no evidence of\nsuch an origin in the great majority of our cases, which are probably\ncerebral in origin. It has been suggested that, in the case of hallucinations\ncentrally initiated, there may be a downward sensory impulse, through which\nthe sense-organs are involved. The view rests chiefly on cases where halluci\nnations resemble retinal after-images,\u2014positive or negative. Examples of\nhallucinations resembling positive after-images. When the hallucination\noccurs some time after the object which it reproduces was seen, it is especi\nally improbable that the retina is concerned. Examples of hallucinations\nreproducing objects seen many years before and almost or quite forgotten.\nHallucinations resembling negative after-images. Binet and Fere's experi\nments in induced hallucinations of colour, followed spontaneously by\nhallucinations of the complementary colour. Dream-images persisting with\ncomplementary colours. Gorham's experiments show that effects which\nappear to be produced on the retina may be purely cerebral. This is con\nfirmed by \"Miss X. 'a\" crystal-visions, where one picture was followed by\nanother, of a complementary colour but different form ; or a mere desire for\nchange was followed by the appearance of the complementary colour.\nThe physiological action involved in most hallucinations is probably\nexclusively cerebral. ........ 134\u2014148\nChapter VIII.\u2014Age, Sex, Heredity, Nationality, and Health.

Women experience more hallucinations than men,\nor at all events remember them better. The disproportion is less in the\nveridical cases. Galton's results as to variations of visualising power in\ndifferent sexes and ages. Evidence that hallucinations tend to run in families,\nand then sometimes tend to take similar forms ; examples. Foreign informants\nreport larger proportion of hallucinations than English, also larger propor\ntion of bisensory cases. Reports as to health of percipients at time of their\nexperiences.

In this chapter we enter on the\nconsideration of the evidence for telepathy afforded by the Census. The\nmain object of the enquiry was to decide whether the number of hallucinations\nprimA facie telepathic is more than chance will account for or not. Evidence\nfor veridicality may be of three kinds : coincidence, conveyance of unknown\ninformation, and collectivity. The discussion in this chapter is confined to\n\" death-coincidences,\" i.e., cases of recognised apparitions occurring within\n12 hours of the death of the person represented, the death being unknown\nto the percipient at the time. There are 80 first-hand cases reported as\ndeath-coincidences in the Census ; by excluding certain types, these are\nreduced to 65. Of these, 19 were known beforehand to the collectors, and\nthere is reason to suspect that 3 of the 19 were specially selected. Deducting\nthese 3, 92 alleged death-coincidences remain. Twenty-six examples of these\nare given. The number of cases, veridical and other, in which it is reported\nthat notes were made and the proportion of notes preserved are discussed.\nEvidence that in some of the 62 cases the closeness of coincidence has been\n\fContents. 399\n\u2022exaggerated is shown to be afforded by the cases reported for remoter\nperiods being too numerous in proportion to the recent ones. From this\nwe infer that the whole number may more safely be estimated at 40 (instead\n\u2022of 62), and an allowance for possibly undetected selection further reduces to\n32 the number which we decide to count in the calculation of the next\nChapter. The extent to which members of the Committee have had personal\ninterviews with the percipients is explained. .... 207--244\nChapter XIII.\u2014Chance Coincidence. The probability that any one\nwill die on a given day, \u2014e.ij., that on which his apparition is seen,\u2014is 1 in\n19,000. The number of apparitions of living persons reported in the Census\nis 381 ; by excluding cases of a type already excluded from death-coincidences,\nthese are reduced to 350. Since there is no evidence that death-coincidences\nare forgotten, we do not apply the correction for oblivion, as calculated in\nChapter III., to them. Applying it to the whole number of apparitions of\nliving persons, and deducting from both sides cases whose hallucinatory\ncharacter is doubtful, we have 30 death-coincidences in about 1,300 cases,\nor 1 in 43,\u2014that is, 440 times the number that chance would produce.\nOr, if reported cases whose hallucinatory character is doubtful are included,\n1 in 66. But the interval between death and apparition is, in most cases,\nmuch less than 12 hours, which greatly increases the improbability of chance\n<\u00bbincidence. The evidence for the death-coincidences must break down in\na wholesale way in order to destroy this argument ; and it is shown that\nneither selection nor a state of the percipient produced by his knowledge\nof the dying person's condition can account for their number. Anxiety\nmay facilitate telepathic communication, but cannot by itself account for\nthe death-coincidences. ........ 245\u2014251\nChapter XIV.\u2014Veridical Hallucinations Continued: Further Coinci\ndental Cases. The three death-coincidences excluded from Chapters XII.\nand XIII. because they were selected. Other cases coinciding with deaths :\nexamples of recognised voices ; example of touch and mental impulse ;\ncases of apparitions of relatives of the dying person ; cases of unrecog\nnised apparitions ; example of an indefinite figure ; and of an unrecognised\nvoice. Hallucinations coinciding with other events than death. Examples\nof apparitions, and of an auditory hallucination, experimentally produced.\nExamples of apparitions coinciding with sudden or serious illness of person\nrepresented. Example of case which may have been a death-coincidence.\nExamples of voices coinciding with sudden attacks of illness. Examples\nof hallucinations coinciding with emotional states or thoughts of the agents.\nExample of a possibly reciprocal telepathic impression. Greater force\nand insistency of telepathic hallucinations 252\u2014302\nChapter XV.\u2014 Collective Hallucinations. Ninety-five out of 1,087 visual\ncases, and 34 out of 493 auditory cases are reported to have been collective ;\nalso two tactile cases. But assumption of collectivity is easily made on in.\nsufficient grounds; also the hallucinatory character of many cases is doubtful.\nExamples of apparitions seen collectively : of a cat ; of recognised living\nand of a recognised dead person ; of an unrecognised figure seen out of\n\f400 Report on the Census of Hallucinations.\ndoors ; of an indefinite figure ; of a shadowy form seen a few hours\nbefore a death. Examples of collective auditory hallucinations : of the voice\nof a dead person ; of a voice coinciding with a death. Two examples\u2014\none coincidental\u2014-where the two percipients have simultaneous but dis\nsimilar impressions. Reference to other cases of collective hallucinations\ngiven in Phantasms of the Living, or since printed in the Journal S.P.R.\nThe different kinds of hallucinations are fairly represented among collective\ncases in the Census. Discussion of explanations. Hypothesis of a basis of\ncommon illusion can only cover a small proportion of cases. The hypothesis\nthat both percipients are directly and independently affected by an external\nagent,\u2014the latter either being or not being reciprocally affected himself,\u2014\nis discussed, and reasons given why it can at most be of restricted application,\nand why, even when applicable, the experiences of the two percipients can\nseldom be independent of each other. The phenomenon is in many respects\nmost easily explained by attributing it to the influence of one percipient ou\nthe other. This may be by word or gesture, or telepathically. There is\nmore evidence that hallucinations may be induced by telepathic than by\nverbal suggestion in the normal condition ; but it is difficult to exclude\nthe agency of ordinary suggestion in collective cases, and probably both\nkinds of suggestion are then operative, assisting each other. The supposed\nsharing of hallucinations by animals is occasionally reported ; from the nature\nof the case this must be doubtful.

Cases of appari\ntions seen a short time before the death of the person represented are rare,\nand of doubtful interpretation. Example of an apparently premonitory\nvision. Example of a partially fulfilled prophecy. Example of an un\nrecognised apparition seen shortly before unexpected illness of percipient's\nson. Example of a hallucination saving the percipient from danger. Un\nrecogmsed local apparitions. Arguments for their not being purely sub\njective rest on apparitions being seen independently by more than one\nperson, and on reasons for associating the apparitions with some deceased\nformer inhabitant. Special sources of error and weakness in evidence.\nAbout 30 cases in Census afford prima facie some such evidence of being\nmore than subjective ; in half, the apparition was supposed to repre\nsent some dead person. Constantly recurring noises form a frequent\npart of the phenomena ; they may sometimes be ordinary noises,\nmisinterpreted, which lead to the seeing of the apparitions. Example\nwhere noises were often heard before apparition was seen. Two similar\nexamples where apparitions were seen by more than one person.\nCase where the apparition was first seen collectively. Recognised local\napparitions. Example of phantom of a dead person seen after unrecognised\nfigure had been seen by another percipient in the same room.

This class is less numerous\nthan that of phantasms of the living, and on the whole more impressive\nto the percipient than other phantasms. They usually appear in familiar\ndress, etc. To prove the possibility of communication from the dead to the\nliving would have important influence on our view of telepathy between the\nliving. But the recognition of telepathy between the living makes it more\ndifficult to prove the possibility of communication from the dead. Evidence\nfrom coincidence is only possible in cases such as those where the death has\ntaken place, but has not been heard of by the percipient ; while information\ngiven by the phantasm may be due to telepathy from a living person, or\nto clairvoyance. In considering the cases in which the evidence for veridi-\ncality is coincidence, the \"death-coincidences\" previously considered must\nbe taken into account. Of the 80 death-coincidences, 10 are known to have\noccurred after the death ; and are, therefore, strictly speaking, coincidental\nphantasms of the dead. Five examples of apparitions of dead persons,\nseen more than 12 hours after the death, but before the percipient\nknew of it ; in three there are veridical features besides the coincidence.\nTaking phantasms of the living and of the dead together, there is a marked\naccumulation of cases about the time of the death, gradually diminishing\non each side of it ; this suggests that there is no discontinuity at death.\nThe cases where the percipient was unaware of the state of the person\nrepresented show that these numbers cannot be accounted for either by\nanxiety about illness or by grief for death. Promises to try to appear after\ndeath are reported in ten cases ; 3 of these were death-coincidences, and\n2 occurred during fatal illness or after the death,\u2014the state of the person\nseen being unknown to the percipient ; example of such a case, in\nwhich there was no coincidence. Two cases in which information unknown\nto the percipient was conveyed to him by the apparition. Example of an\napparition appropriate to the circumstances of the percipient. Example of\n\u25a0corresponding impressions, suggesting agency of a dead person, simulta\nneously experienced by two percipients. Example of an apparition seen\non the same night by two persons in different places.

Having been\nrequested by the Congress to take charge of this enquiry in the United\nKingdom, I beg to ask for your aid in this important task.\nThe experiences to which the question on the other side relates are what\nPsychologists generally would describe as casual hallucinatious of sane\npersons : but it is desired to include in this collection phantasmal appear\nances which some percipients would deny to be hallucinations because they\nregard them as presentations of spiritual reality.\nThe object of our enquiry is (1) to ascertain approximately the propor\ntion of persons who have such experiences, and (2) to obtain details as to the\nexperiences with a view to examining into their cause and meaning.\nFor the first object it is important that the question should be very\nWIDELY ASKED AND OF ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE\u2014NOT ONLY OF THOSE WHO\nARE THOUGHT LIKELY TO HAVE HAD SUCH AN EXPERIENCE OR OF THOSE\nWHO ARE THOUGHT LIKELY NOT TO HAVE HAD IT. THE ANSWER \" No \"\nAND THE ANSWER \" Ye.S \" ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANT. The question should\nnot, however, be asked of persons who are known to have been at any time\ninsane, and it is not intended to include experiences of delirium.\nIt is important not to put down second hand answers\u2014not to state on\nthe authority of B that A has or has not had an experience of the kind\nenquired into, but to ask A himself. The name, address, sex and occupation\nof those answering can be filled in by yourself (the collector) and we shall\nbe glad if you will also put a cross against any answer known to you before\nasking the question. The question should not be put to persons under 21\nyears of age, though remembered experiences which have occurred at any\nage should be included. In the case of affirmative answers the age at the\ntime of the experience should be given.\nThe experiences in question are believed to be rather rare, so that you\nwill probably get few and perhaps no answers \" Yes \" among the 25. It will,\nhowever, greatly assist us in the second part of our work\u2014namely,\nexamining into the nature of the experiences\u2014if, should you receive the\nanswer \"Yes,\" you will induce the person answering to fill in schedule B, of\nwhich three copies are sent with this, and of which more can be obtained\nfrom me. A separate copy of schedule B should be used for each person\nanswering \" Yes.\"\n2 d 2\n\f404 Report on the Census of Hallucinations.\nShould you find it impossible to collect 25 answers, please return the\npaper filled up as far as you can. But it is much desired to obtain the\nanswers in batches of 25 if possible.\nI shall be happy to give any further information that may seem to you\nnecessary ; and if you can undertake to collect any further batches of 25\nanswers, or know of any one who would do so, I shall be glad to forward\nthe necessary forms.\nI am, yours faithfully,\nHENRY SIDGWICK.\nPlease return this paper when filled up to\nProfessor Sidgwick,\nCambridge.\nB International Congress of Experimental Psychology.\nFURTHER QUESTIONS TO BE ADDRESSED TO ANY PERSON\nANSWERING YES TO THE QUESTION OF SCHEDULE A.\nNamely :\u2014Have you ever, when believing yourself to be completely\nawake, had a vivid impression of seeing, or being touched by a living\nbeing, or inanimate object, or of hearing a voice ; which impression, so\nfar as you could discover, was not due to any external physical cause ?\n1. Please state what you saw or heard or felt, and give the place, date\nand hour of the experience as nearly as you can.\n2. How were you occupied at the time, and were you out of health or\nin grief or anxiety ? What was your age ?\n3. Was the impression that of some one whom you were in the habit of\nseeing, and do you know what he or she was doing at the time 1\nA. Were there other persons present with you at the time, and if so\ndid they in any way share the experience ?\n5. Please state whether you have had such an experience more than\nonce, and if so give particulars of the different occasions.\n6.

I first became aware that my eyes and ears could deceive\n-me when about 18 ; up to that time, and in childhood, I no doubt suffered a\ngreat deal from ignorance of this fact. Since the age of 18 I have carefully\nwatched myself and these illusions, so that I can give an exact account of\nseveral. I have been able to make clear to myself that, in my case, there is\na distinct connection between them and trouble of some sort at the nervous\ncentres ; that they are most vivid when physical exhaustion is accompanied\nby nervous excitement ; and that the will can\u2014when once attention is\naroused\u2014have a great deal to say in controlling or increasing these halluci\nnations. The visual illusions have been of animals, human beings\u2014servants\n\u2022and friends,\u2014and in one instance a hideous apparition of monstrous size ;\n{the auditory] of hearing voices and musical sounds.\"\nThe following complete account, sent in answer to our request for\nfurther details, was enclosed in a letter dated February 19th, 1891.\n\" (1) The first hallucination of which I can give an exact account occurred\nto me at the age of five or six. I woke, shortly after going to sleep, in a\ndark room, and saw a great patch of brilliant light, and in the light the figures\nof two or more angels bending towards me. The vision was a great delight to\nme, I being a very devout child. The incredulity with which my account\n\u25a0of it was received by my elders I tried to meet by giving details,\u2014such as\nthat 'the angels wore blue boots,'\u2014which, of course, provoked a ridicule\nwhich taught me to keep silence ; but such details serve to show that the\nvision was perfectly distinct in all its parts.\n\" As I grew up, every now and then I made statements as to servants\n\u25a0or friends having done things, or having been in places, the truth of which\nthey denied. I was punished for 'lying' or ' inventing,' as I believed,\nunjustly. In the light of later experiences, I have now no doubt that I was\nfrequently the subject of hallucinations.\n\"(2) The first which I was in a position clearly to recognise as such\n.occurred during the Indian Mutiny. Several members of our family were in\ndanger. One night, on which we had all been talking late of them, after we\nhad parted and gone upstairs to bed, I stood before my dressing-table plaiting\nmy hair, when my attention was arrested by a faint spot in the centre of the\nmirror ; this to my amazement gradually enlarged (as a grease spot spreads\nwith heat) till the whole surface was covered, and then, \u2014in the centre of\nthis veil,\u2014came through the face of one of the near relatives above men\ntioned, as plain as might have been his living reflexion. To a moment of\n\u2022spell-bound fascination succeeded frantic terror, and I rushed out of my\nroom. There was, however, no one I dared tell. My father would have\nAdmonished me not to be a fool ; as for my mother, then in delicate health,\nI could not venture to name such a matter to her\u2014the appearance having been\n\f408 Report on the Census of Hallucinations.\nthat of her only son. I noted, however, the day and hour, and ascertained,\nsix weeks later, that the relative seen had incurred no sort of danger at that\ndate, but was in comfortable quarters, in conditions of ordinary safety, far\nfrom the scenes of disturbance.\n\" (3) From the next instance to which I will refer dates the period since\nwhich I have observed myself and these hallucinations. I was about nine\nteen or twenty. I had been overworking, it was late, and I was dressing for\ndinner both tired and hungry. I stooped to take my slippers from the floor,\nand as I did so, a large gray rat jumped from the folds of my petticoats and\nran across the room. I had no doubt at the moment of its reality, and main\ntained its actual existence in spite of all the household ; but a little while\nafterwards I saw my gray rat again, and after pursuing him into a corner put\na stick through him,for which he was none the worse. This circumstance caused\nme to watch carefully for any repetition of a similar illusion. At variou*\nintervals, for the next three or four years, the same apparition,\u2014varied by the\napparition of a cat, sometimes gray and more rarely black,\u2014continued to\ntrouble me. At this period, 1864, I began to be more or less subject to\nneuralgia in the right side of the head.\n\" (4) In the winter of 1866 I was still suffering in this way. One Sunday\nevening, I had given special permission to a man-servant to absent himself\nout of his turn ; going into the dining-room to fetch a biscuit, I stood at the\nsideboard with my back to the fire, which was blazing brilliantly, when I was.\nstartled to hear some one poking it violently, as I had seen no one when I\nentered the room ; turning round I found that the servant to whom I had\ngiven leave of absence was standing on the hearthrug, having the poker\nstill in his hand . At my movement he turned, and I thought looked rather\nsurprised. It occurred to me that some small tyranny had deprived him of\nhis outing, so I made enquiry, from which it was established that at the\ntime at which I saw him in the dining-room, he was in his seat in church,\nhis presence there being fully attested by other members of the family.\nNo one was in the house at the time of his apparition except myself and a\nwoman servant. The appearance on this occasion being perfectly natural,\nthere was nothing which at the time led me to examine it closely.\n\"(5) About a month later, the neuralgia, from which I continued to\nsuffer frequently, became occasionally severe. I was writing alone in the\nlibrary late in the afternoon, the lamps were lighted, and every corner of\nthe room and of a further room, the door into which stood open, was per\nfectly clear. The pain becoming acute, I got up and began to pace up and\ndown from door to door. I had done this several times, when, as I turned\nand faced the open door of the further room, I saw standing against it a\nfigure of supernatural height, entirely draped in white ; the face only was\nfully exposed, and was covered with blood which dripped on the garments.\nThe shock for the instant was horrible. Then I determined to be clear about\nthis thing. First I shut my eyes and observed\u2014what I had promised a\ndoctor to observe\u2014namely, whether or no I saw the apparition when my\neyes were shut ; he had believed that I should, but I am quite certain I did\nnot. Next, I opened them and looked ; it was fully over six feet, and\nleaned, rather than stood, against the door, the colour of which (though\nwhite) was dark against the whiteness of its draperies. The draperies were\n\fAppendix D. 409\ncotton, or linen, and one hand, the left, muffled in them, rested on the top\nof the door. The face, smeared with blood, had an expression of great\nagony. I shut my eyes again, opened them, saw it much less distinctly as\na man of white streaked with scarlet, resolved to walk to it, but in two\nsteps it was gone as instantaneously as it had come. In this instance, again,\nI failed to trace any sort of connection between the form I saw and anything\nwhich I had read, or heard, or seen at any time previous.\n\" Here I should mention that a careful examination, later in the year,\nshowed that the neuralgia, from which I had been suffering for so many\nyears, had been provoked in the part of the head in which it showed\nitself by the enlargement of a tooth which pressed on a nerve. This matter\nwas duly attended to and I ceased to suffer from acute pain in the temple,.\nbut when overworked was frequently liable to attacks of a less acute kind\nin the knee and hip, which invariably indicated over-fatigue of mind or\nbody.\n\" (6) At a later period I was nursing a member of my family suffering\nfrom an infectious disease, the course of which had already taken a favour\nable turn, when, on going to the bedroom, early one morning, I saw a large\nhalf-bred black retriever sitting in an angle of the stairs. I sent a servant\ndown and ascertained there was no dog there, but continued to see it, and\nat last it became a fear to me to pass the landing fiom which I saw it, and I\navoided going down the stairs. During the visitations of the black dog, it\nwas always visible in the corner of the stairs whenever I looked at the\nplace. It never changed its position ; and in the end, one night, feeling.\nvery ill, I fainted on the stairs, having sickened with the same disease.\n\" I had noted the day on which the apparition of the dog began; it was\nbetween four and five days after, according to the usual calculation, I had\nbegun to sicken with the malady. The duration of this hallucination dis\ntinguishes it from others which I have had when seriously ill, and which may\nhave been of the nature of delirium, and which I will not, therefore,\nrecapitulate here.\n\" (7) I will go on to mention the only apparition which I have seen out\nof doors and in full day. I was in the Highlands for my health; the whole\nparty (of which I was one) had decided at breakfast on making an expedition\nwhich was to occupy the day. I remained at home resting, till, after lunch,\nI started on a long solitary ride, in the opposite direction to that by which\nthe others would return. About five o'clock, in an August afternoon, I\nturned back along the Pitlochry road. I was walking my horse slowly, I had\nlifted my veil in order to look at the moors, and I was not thinking of any\nhuman being : I wanted to enjoy being alone. To my annoyance, therefore,\nat a sudden turn in the road. I saw one of my friends, a man, sitting on a\nheap of stones under a little fir on the left of the road about 50 yards from\nme. Believing that he had gone to Rannoch with the rest, I stared hard at\nhim, and recognised his suit, his wideawake, fishing tackle and basket, and\nnoticed that he looke d greatly absorbed by something he was doing with his\nfly-book, which he held in his hand, so much so that he paid no attention to\nmy approach. When at last I was come so close that I could distinguish\nthe smallest details of his clothes, and even the expression of his face, I\ncalled out, and, getting no answer, whipped up my horse intending to pull\n\f410 Report on the Census of Hallucinations.\nup in front of where he was sitting. As I did so, he moved slightly and a\ncurious change occurred ; the whole figure \u2014I then being within a couple of\nyards or so\u2014shivered, as it were, and vanished. I jumped off my horse, I\nwalked round the tree, I looked over the bank : there was nobody. In\nspite of my firm desire not to let myself be impressed by these hallucina\ntions I rode back uneasy. Half an hour after my return, my friend drove\nup with the rest of the party in a break from Rannoch. According to all\nthe rules of second sight he should have died within the year ; he did not,\nnor did any trouble or misfortune befall him.\n\"I have mentioned in connection with the above hallucinations the\nneuralgia in the head, which was connected with trouble of [a] nerve.\nI should therefore note that there was no such trouble prior to 1864 nor\nnfter 1867. At the time when I saw the apparition in Scotland, I was told\nthat the neuralgia in the hip and knee was caused by some pressure on a\nnerve centre near the spine low down in the back. Before I close what I\nhave to say on the subject of these visual hallucinations, I have, however,\ntwo other points to mention in this connexion : )1) That I have strong\nvisual memory, which for years I cultivated to the point of being able,\u2014\nhaving looked with that intention at pictures, or other works of art,\u2014to recall\nthem, by an effort of will, many weeks after, with such distinctness that I\ncould set down from the visualised image full and accurate details of com\nposition and colour. (2) That I have eyes of different focus, the right eye\nsight shorter than the left. Also [there is a tendency on the part of the right\neye to diverge outwards, so that I have to make an effort in order to keep\nboth eyes fixed on an object.] If I am not wearing glasses, there is a\nmoment of consciousness when I look to the left as the effort is made to\nbring the two sights together. I am now almost sure that the leap given by\nthe apparitions of cats, rats, etc., which has been invariably from right to\nleft, is connected with this trouble of the sight.\n\" (8) Auditory hallucinations have been less frequent in my case than\nthe visual ones. Occasionally voices calling\u2014always voices I could recog\nnise, but more often musical sounds. One example will suffice. I woke\nin the night, during a period of convalescence after a serious illness. It is\nunusual for me to wake, as children say, ' broad awake ' ; on this occasion\nI did so, and with a curious sense of alert attention. Within half a minute\nor so I heard a perfectly pure note in mid-air ; the sound was extremely low\nat first, but went on swelling by imperceptible degrees until it reached a\nclimax at which the volume was such that I wondered the house was not\nroused ; at its full, when it had become almost painful to listen, it snapped\noff short in ringing stillness.\n\" You ask me to explain what I mean when I say that the will can affect\nthese hallucinations. I do not mean that at the instant of their occurrence\nthe will can do anything beyond keep the brain steady, and that in spite of\nfear, which sometimes (I confess) accompanies their presence. I have,\nhowever (you must take it for what it is worth), an intimate conviction and\nconsciousness that there was a period when physical weakness, coupled with\nthe moral dispositions which accompany a strongly mystic and speculative\nbias of mind, might have caused me (let me confess further, were near causing\nme) to take passive satisfaction in my own hallucinations instead of treating\n\fAppendix D. 411\nthem as a matter for investigation. I am conscious that in that state they\nwere tending to become more frequent.\n\" Remember they have had always a powerful, unconscious ally in the\nstrong visual memory which I cultivated for purposes of my own con\nvenience.\n\" In conclusion, I have to say that for five years past I have almost\nentirely ceased to be disturbed by any such apparitions or auditory halluci\nnations, and that during these five years I have been steadily gaining in\nhealth, and in what is called ' tone.' \"\n\f412 Report on the Census of Hallucinations.\nAPPENDIX E.\nThe following account is given by a medical man of the hallucinatory\nexperiences, occurring during ill-health, of a patient1 of his own, who writes\nto confirm the accuracy of the account.\nMarch, 1892.\n\" Mrs. S., aged 40, has been married 61 years. Has no children. Since\ngirlhood has been subject to intense neuralgic headaches, for the time\ncompletely incapacitating her. Up to marriage lived a busy, indeed,\narduous life as an artist.\n\" In 1875 had first optical hallucination. Three months after her father's\ndeath, she was thinking deeply of him, when she suddenly saw his face,\nwithout body, in front of her. She was startled, but the face lacked\nsolidity, and she knew it was a hallucination. In 1890, in India, she\nhad in May an attack of bronchitis, followed by a long neurotic attack,\ncharacterised by insomnia, tremblings, complete prostration, &c. , &c. This\nlasted till September, when she was completely convalescent. Between\nMay and September she had frequent and varied optical hallucinations. Of\nthese she gives instances : (1) an Afghan who persistently stood mute at the\nfoot of her bed ; (2) a man on a velocipede travelling rapidly from left bo\nright ; a peculiarity of this man was that he always appeared with a\n'rainbow edge,' as if a little out of focus ; (3) an ayah and child, with the\npeculiarity that they were always as if made of plaster of Paris : in this\ncase there was also auditory hallucination, as the child appeared to cry and\nwas heard to cry ; (4) innumerable hallucinations of animals and insects .\n\"The human appearances never deceived the intelligence, but Mrs. S.\nwas constantly taken in by the small animals, and especially the insects,\nwhich she would try to brush off the walls or the bedclothes.\n\" By the end of September all these appearances had disappeared with\nthe establishment of complete convalescence. In November, 1890, she first\nsaw an appearance, which has since many times recurred. She was in her\nhouse in India when a black cat flashed past her from behind, on the right\nside, as if chivied by something. She jumped up to stop or protect it, when\nit disappeared. It did not fade away, or disappear behind furniture. It was\nsimply gone. Between November, 1890, and July, 1891, she saw it at\nirregular intervals, and quite causelessly and suddenly ; it always 'came from\nbehind, and on the right side.\n\" Between July, 1891, and March, 1892, she has seen it, she thinks,\nabout five times. Sometimes she is still momentarily taken in, and jumps\nup, but not always. She notices that the outline is a little blurred, but\notherwise the appearance is absolutely natural. On two occasions she has seen\nthe cat in a different way. She suddenly saw it standing with its back and\ntail raised, as if about to rub itself against her skirts. She was about to\nstoop to caress it when it disappeared with absolute suddenness. On the\nfirst of these two occasions she was deceived by the appearance ; not on the\nsecond, as she recognised the animul which had previously deceived her.\n\"H. R. F.\"\n1 See p. 162.\n\fAppendix E. 413\nMrs. S. adds :\u2014\n\"During May, June, and July, 1890, when my illness was at its worst,\nI w;ib surrounded by a circular ring-like line, and any one passing through\nthis imaginary boundary gave me intense pain at the top of my head. I\nmention this because the line was a visible one, whitish in colour, and\nslightly quivering, very like the phosphorescent mark left on a match-box\nwhen a match has been drawn across it. This line was not always there,\nbut was, I think, present during part of every day and night. I could not\nbe called light-headed when I saw it, as I had sense enough never to mention\nit, knowing that my husband's distress would be increased if he knew that\neach time he came to my side I went through some moments of severe pain.\nWhen people left my bedside and repassed the circle I suffered no incon\nvenience. I have never seen this since July, 1890.\n\" It is not literally true that seeing my father's face was my first optical\nillusion, though it was the first after I grew up. When I was a child\nbetween nine and ten years old I had some odd experiences, which perhaps\nI had better explain. About that time I showed an unnatural quickness\nabout learning, and it was thought well to separate me for a time from my\nbrothers and sisters,\u2014who were all much older than I was, and whose society\nwas thought by my father too stimulating for me,\u2014and to send me to live in\na farmhouse where my chief companions were two little girls about my own\nage, who were not interested in algebraical or any other problems. Among\nother subjects which occupied my mind to an unusual extent was that of\nreligion, and when waiting for my companions while they did their lessons\nI usually spent my time in a big meadow, praying and doing mental\narithmetic in about equal parts. During my prayers I saw (I think with\neyes shut) the most beautiful faces, which I believed to be those of angels.\nBut one day to my great joy and awe I saw with my eyes open a great and\nmisty figure which I thought to be that of God himself. I do not remember\nmuch about the figure except that it blotted out the trees at the end of the\nfield, and that the face vaguely resembled that of God in the picture of the\nCreation of Man on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, with which I may\npossibly have been already familiar from engravings. The angels of my\nprayers certainly bore a very strong family likeness to those I had seen in\npictures in the National Gallery and elsewhere. There were at other times\nduring my childhood visions of a like kind, but I attempt no account of\nthem, as I cannot be sure of the truth of my memory regarding them.\n\"During that portion of my life which was most exclusively devoted to\npainting, I constantly noticed a visual phenomenon which may be extremely\ncommon, but which may be possibly connected with this tendency of mine\nto see optical illusions. If by any chance after a day's painting I entered a\ndarkened room, I frequently saw at a distance of about eighteen inches from\nmy face an exact representation, brightly illuminated, of whatever part of my\npicture I had been engaged upon during the day. These appearances were\nalways unconnected with my thoughts at the moment, and were quite\ndifferent from those visualizations which one can get at any time by closing\none's eyes and thinking of the objects one wishes to visualise.\"\n\f414 Report on the Census of Hallucinations.\nAPPENDIX F.\nCollective Visual Hallucinatious, divided according to conditions of perception.\nPercip\nients\nin bed.\nPercip\nients up\nand in\ndoors.\nSeen\nout of\ndoors.\nTotals.\nRealistic human apparitions of living persons 3 10 14 27\nn \u201e of dead persons \u2014 6 2 8\n,, ,, unrecognised 2 13 17 32\nIncompletely developed apparitions 4 4 4 12\nVisions \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nAngels and religious apparitions or visions \u2014 - \u2014 \u2014\nApparitions, grotesque,horrible, or monstrous 1 \u2014 2 3\n,, of animals \u2014 3 1 4\n,, of definite inanimate objects \u2014 1 \u2014 1\n, , of lights 1 1 2\n,, of indefinite objects \u2014 5 1 6\nTotals 11 42 42 95\nNote.\u2014This Table contains only cases reported to us at first-hand by at\nleast one percipient.

The number of percipients included in the\nCensus, whose collective experiences are here tabulated, is 120.\n\fAppendix G. 415\nAPPENDIX G.\nA PROPOSED SCIIEMK OF APPARITIONS.\nMy personal share in the work of the Committee on the Census of\nHallucinations has been quite too small to entitle me to interpose opinions\nof my own among the concordant opinions of colleagues far more familiar\nwith the actual evidence here under discussion. It has, however, been\nthought desirable that a view, somewhat divergent from that taken in the\nReport itself, should be offered to the reader ; and I proceed briefly to state\ncertain suggestions as to the nature and classification of hallucinations, the\nmeaning of collective percipience, etc., without expending space either on\ncontroversial argument, or on the repetition of my own deep sense\u2014here\nexpressed once for all\u2014of the disputable and provisional character of all\nthat I can say.\nI must premise that with the evidential criticisms and conclusions of\nthis Report I am in full accord. I admit also the force of the theoretical\narguments, as deduced from the range of facts here lying under immediate\nsurvey. But I feel impelled, in forming a judgment on some of the\nproblems involved, to take account of certain groups of cognate phenomena\nwhich it has hardly been possible to compare or to consider at length in a\nReport, like the present, of definite and limited scope.\nThe spontaneous sensory hallucinations of sane persons, with which this\nReport is concerned, have been compared in Chapter I. with the experiments\nin telepathy, which at certain points closely resemble them . I desire here to\nset forth these hallucinations as members of a still wider class of phenomena\u2014\na class comprising all \" messages,\" to give them the most generalised title,\nwhether sensory or motor, whether spontaneous or experimental, which rise\nfrom beneath the level of ordinary consciousness to externalise themselves\nin some form cognisable by the every-day supraliminal self. Some of these\nmessages apparently spring from the percipient's own mind alone, and are\nin that sense subjective ; others seem to be the result of some external\ninfluence exercised subliminally upon the percipient's mind ; but both the\nself-generated and the telepathic phantasms or messages may be in some\nsort veridical, as conveying to the percipient's supraliminal self some know\nledge of which only his subliminal self was previously possessed. I believe\nindeed that in certain rare cases these messages involve, or are accompanied\nby, effects produced upon the material world ; and such effects are of course\nobservable by onlookers in an ordinary or supraliminal manner. But the\nessentially subliminal character of the message itself, as received by its\nprimary percipient, is not altered. Even those physical phenomena,\u2014\nwhatever their ultimate source,\u2014are in the percipient subliminally initiated,\nand depend upon intimate processes which never rise above the conscious\nthreshold.\nThe recollection of this close parallelism between sensory hallucinations\nand other forms of subliminal message will influence, I think, in various\nways our estimate of the sources, and of the true nature, of the phantasms\nwith which we have in this Report to deal.\nIn the first place, and as a matter of evidential statistics, this wider com\n\f416 Report on the Census of Halhtcinatiom.\nparison suggests that one assumption made throughout this Report,\u2014and\nrightly made, as telling against the argument for telepathy,\u2014is probably to\nsome unknown extent in excess of the truth. The calculations above given\ndo not assume that non-coincidental hallucinations are ever due to telepathy.\nWhen A., the agent, is seen by P., the percipient, at a moment when nothing\nparticular is happening to A, this is counted as a purely subjective or\nfalsidical apparition. Rightly so, I repeat, for we cannot prove that there\nwas any telepathy in the matter. But now consider the cognate phenomena\nof automatic script and crystal vision. Through either of these methods suit\nably gifted percipients can externalise subliminal messages coming either\nfrom incarnate or from discarnate agents. Such messages compare with\napparitions much as casual talks with a friend compare with telegrams from\nhim. The spontaneous apparition, or subliminal telegram, represents, we\nmay suppose, the greater energy of communication, and is likely to find its\nspecial function in conveying the news of some immediate and important\nfact. But we can no more say beforehand to what occasions this flashing\nmessage will be restricted than we can be sure how many telegrams a friend\nmay think it worth while to send out about a play or a dinner party. The\nvague or unverifiable messages which make the bulk of automatic script\nand crystal vision may rise sometimes into the intenser, but briefer and less\nintelligible, form of a phantasmal picture of the living or departed friend\nwho happens, though under the stress of no crisis, to have his thoughts\nturned to us at the time.\nHow many of these non-coincidental phantasms may be thus in reality\ntelepathic, we cannot tell. We positively know that they are not all so ; for\nwe know that in various conditions of body phantasms appear which are\nremoved by mere bodily treatment, and which as yet we have no sufficient\npower of discriminating, by anything in their own aspect, from telepathic\napparitions. But the caution, nevertheless, is of importance throughout all\nthis enquiry ; and its importance is greater for that class of apparitions\nwhose evidential value it is the most difficult to appraise. The dead, for the\nmost part, are beyond coincidences. If a departed spirit appears, he must,\nI suppose, appear when best he can ; he cannot show us his diary and mark\nhis hour ; and if we have accustomed ourselves too strictly to attending only\nto phantasms which bear witness to an immediate fact we may sweep into the\nlimbo of subjective hallucinations certain phenomena which really indicate\nan extra-terrene source.\nThis point premised, as one to be kept in mind throughout, let us now\nendeavour, in a very brief review of the main classes of hallucinations,\u2014\nor subliminally generated visual and auditory quasi-percepts, to give them a\nmore closely-fitting although a more cumbrous name,\u2014to learn by analogies\nsomething of their more intimate nature, something of what is really\ntaking place when a figure is seen, or voice heard, by one or more per\ncipients, which figure or sound has, so far as we can discover, no material\ncounterpart.\nClass I.\u2014The simplest form of hallucination seems to be that which\nfollows upon a conscious, supraliminal suggestion given by A. to P., which\nsuggestion P. at once or after an interval works up, so to say, into a hallucina\ntion, with details of his own. This is indeed a mere exaggeration of the pro\n\fAppendix G. 417\ncessesof ordinary life. In common life, if A. says to P. \" I saw an elephant,\"\nP., if a good visualiser, will at once see an elephant \"in his mind's eye.\"\nLet P. be specially suggestible, and, in the hypnotic trance, or even wide\nawake, he will visualise the elephant with such intensity that it actually\nseems to stand before him. A little practice, and he will be able to carry\nout a deferred suggestion, and if told on Monday in the hypnotic trance to\nsee the elephant on Tuesday, he will so see it.\nIn this familiar case A. has done nothing in any way transcendental. He\nhas but spoken ordinary words ; he can have no other than ordinary means\nof foretelling or of observing their effect. The hallucination which he starts\nmay of course be shared by several persons, if he makes the suggestion to\nseveral persons together ; but each of these will have his own independent\nhallucination ; there will be no true \" collectivity.\"\nClass II. \u2014Our next\u2014and widest\u2014step is to the case where A.,\nat a distance from P., endeavours to transfer to him a hallucinatory\nimage. In experiments such as these, we can rarely say whether the\nsubliminal operation, so to call it, is mainly A.'s or P.'s. It may resemble\nan impression of the picture by A. upon P.'s mind, or an extraction\nof the picture by P. out of A.'s mind. Assuming for the present that A.\nreally is subliminally active in the matter, it is plain that his action is now\nvery different from the mere task of fonning syllables and expelling air\nwhich was all that he needed to perform in Class I. Then his action was\nmotor and molar ; now it is telepathic, and possibly molecular. Possibly\nmolecular, I say ; for if his \"telepathic impact\" consists in a direct im\npingement upon P.'s brain-cells, than we cannot feel confident that any\nmerely molar operation can effect a result so complex. There may be need\nof a selective action upon specific molecules in P. 's brain ;\u2014such an action as\nthe living energy, whatever it be, in each of us is wont itself to exercise upon\nthe brain through which it finds manifestation.\nThis question presents itself in a striking form when the transferred im\npression is an idea of sleep, or command to sleep ; for thus the impact, so\nto say, of the agent's telergic impulse becomes at once and conspicuously\nvisible in the percipient's sudden trance.\nBe this as it may, A. is now getting, by whatever means, directly at the\nsubliminal part of P. ; and such action we must at any rate call transcen\ndental, for it lies entirely outside the synthesis of the forces that we know. We\ncan now no longer guess whether A. may himself experience any effect from\nthe effort ; whether he may have any subliminal knowledge or memory\nof the success of such an experiment. There are some faint indications\nthat this is sometimes the case. Here, too, it is that the possibility of\ngenuine collectivity of percipience begins. The first trace of it is an occa\nsional experiment where the transferred picture or impression is caught up\nby more than one person present\u2014persons probably all of them on the\nalert to catch the image. In such a case it does not seem as though there\nwere any real contagion of the hallucination from one to another percipient ;\nfor sometimes an unintended percipient will catch the image when the\nperson intended to catch it fails. The influence of proximity\u2014however that\nis to be explained\u2014seems potent here. Only in one case that I remember\u2014\nthe experiment of Wesermann's mentioned in Chapter I. as \" unique\"\u2014do we\n2 E\n\f418 Report on the Census of Hallucinations.\nfind any image conveyed by telepathic experiment to an unintended, as well as\nto the intended, percipient at a distance : with the exception of one special\nform of image alone.\nClass III. \u2014The one exception of which I speak,\u2014the one experimental\ntelepathic image which seems to have a fair chance of being perceived by\nunintended percipients at a distance,\u2014is that of the agent's self. The\nreferences given in Chapter I. of the Report to experiments of this type\nwill enable the reader to judge to what extent these self-projections differ\nin this and in other characteristics from the commoner projections of a\nmere image or idea. As this volume passes through the press an account\nreaches me of a fresh experiment of this kind, made between two ladies well\nknown to me, whom I will call Miss Danvers and Mrs. Fleetwood, which I\nhere quote as well illustrating some of the points to which I wish to call\nattention. I asked Miss Danvers to endeayour to appear to Mrs. Fleet\nwood, without forewarning that lady, and to send me a letter-card (the best\nvehicle for such communications, as it carries the postal date impressed\non what remains, nevertheless, a private letter),\u2014to tell me of the attempt\nbefore she knew whether it had succeeded or no.\nOn June 20th, 1894, I received the following letter, dated June 19th,\nfrom Miss Danvers, with two enclosures :\u2014\n\" On Sunday night at 12 p.m. I tried to appear to Mrs. Fleetwood [at a\ndistance of about nine miles] and succeeded in feeling as if T were really in\nher room. I had previously written my statement, which I enclose, together\nwith Mrs. Fleetwood's, which she has just sent me. She wrote it also at the\ntime, not knowing I was trying to appear. I was lying down, not kneeling,\nbut the other details are correct.\"\nA memorandum, signed by Miss Danvers, was enclosed, as follows :\u2014\n\"June 17th, 1894, 12 p.m. I write this just before trying to appear to Mrs.\nFleetwood. My hair is down, and I am going to lie down and try to appear\nwith my eyes closed.\"\nAlso a memorandum, signed by Mrs. Fleetwood, as follows : \u2014\" Sunday\nnight, June 17th, 1894.\u2014I woke from my first sleep to see Edith Danvers\napparently kneeling on an easy chair by my bedside, her profile turned\ntowards me, her hair flowing, and eyes closed, orlooking quite down. I felt\nstartled at first, as I always do, on seeing visions in waking moments, but\ndetermined to keep quiet ; and after I was fully awake, and able to reason\nwith myself the figure still remained, and then gradually faded like a dis\nsolving view. I got up and looked at the clock. It was just twelve. I was\nalone in the room. As I now write, it is about two minutes after twelve.\"\nIn conversation on June 23rd Miss Danvers told me that she had seen,\nin a sort of flash, Mrs. Fleetwood start up in bed, rest on her elbow, and\nlook towards her. She had not been clearly aware of her own attitude in\nMrs. Fleetwood's room, although she seemed aware of her position, which\ncorresponded to the place towards which Mrs. Fleetwood gazed. Miss\nDanvers had never previously made notes of an experiment, and had not\nseen the importance of writing down this point at once, nor had she felt\nconfident that Mrs. Fleetwood really saw her. Mrs. Fleetwood also sent me\na letter of Miss Danvers to herself, dated June 18th, in which, among\nvarious other matters, Miss Danvers asks, \" Have I appeared to you at all 1\n\fAppendix G. 419\nI tried last night, but you may not have been alone.\" There is, of course,\ntherefore, no proof that Miss Danvers' sense of invasion of the room was\nmore than subjective; but the point is worth mention in connexion with the ex\nperiment presently to follow. As regards Mrs. Fleetwood's \" visions in wak\ning moments,\" that lady herself believes them to have been all in some sense\nveridical, but they have not been recorded. They included two visions of\nMiss Danvers. at moments when Miss Danvers on her part was strongly\ndirecting her attention to Mrs. Fleetwood. So, at least, both ladies believe ;\nbut the visions were not recorded at the time.\nMiss Danvers then made a second experiment, in which, through some\nmisunderstanding of the due conditions, she informed Mrs. Fleetwood\nbeforehand of her intended invasion. It turned out, however, that Mrs.\nFleetwood saw nothing whatever;\u2014so that we have at least the negative\nassurance that mere expectation on her part does not necessarily produce a\nvision. Miss Danvers then made a third (unannounced) experiment of a\nrather different kind, which she describes to me as follows in a letter dated\nJune 27th, 1894.\n\"On Monday, June 25th, at 12.15 a.m., I thought I would try to go\nto Mrs. Fleetwood's room, but did not think she could see me. I succeeded\nin seeing her room, and saw the third volume of Marcdla, lying on a chair\nby the bedside. I did not know she was reading it, as I thought she had\nfinished it long ago, so I was surprised. Mrs. Fleetwood did not appear to\nsee me, or make any sign. The room was otherwise much as usual. On the\nsame day I saw Mrs. Fleetwood, and asked her if what I saw was correct,\nand she said it was perfectly so. She also said she was suffering from tooth\nache and could not see me, but felt a presence in the room.\"\nMrs. Fleetwood writes, June 27th :\u2014\" When Miss Danvers came to lunch\nwith me, on Monday last, she asked me if I had taken the third volume of\nMarcdla up to my room the night before (the 24th) ; as she had been there\nin the spirit, and had seen it lying on a chair by my bed. This was pre\ncisely what had happened. I had taken up the book to read in the early\nmorning, but I am sure Miss Danvers did not know of my often doing so\n[i.e., taking a book to her bedroom], as it is not my usual habit.\" On\nJune 30th, Mrs. Fleetwood adds: \"Miss Danvers did know we had\nhad Marcella in the house, for she read it when here ; but she quite\nthought it had been sent away long before she saw it in my room. She\ndid not know that I had laid it aside, being busy, and had kept back the\nthird volume.\"\nThis case, I think, strengthens the view which other experimental cases\nhave suggested, namely, that in these deliberate projections of personality\nthere is something more than a thought which travels ; that there is an\ninvading presence which in some sense changes its own relation to space,\nwhile not permanently quitting the agent's organism.\nClass IV.\u2014We pass next, by a gradual transition, from the experi\nmental to the spontaneous projection of the agent's apparition. There is, I\nsay, no marked line ; for it seems always to be from the subliminal region\nthat the telepathic impulse proceeds ; and it perhaps makes little difference\nto the operation whether the supraliminal self was aware that it was to be\nattempted or no. In most of these cases, unfortunately, we can ask no\n2 E 2\n\f420 Report on the Census of Hallucinations.\nquestion of the subliminal self. His apparition indicated his removal\nfrom our world ; and we can never say how far he was himself conscious of\nthe impression which at that moment he produced, or of the desire to\nproduce it. The rarity of the testimony to such reciprocal action need not\ntherefore, I think, prevent us from regarding the reciprocal type as\ntheoretically the most complete ; or from hoping that experimenters\u2014through\nthe kind assistance of their subliminal selves !\u2014may be more and more often\nable to realise this ideal.\nClass V.\u2014Thus far we have been tracing the action of the so-called\nagent alone. But this view as to the probability of some kind of latent\nreciprocity in these appearances is strengthened by the growing number of\nthe cases where the so-called percipient appears to have really played the\nactive role. He seems to have invaded the so-called agent's presence, and\ncarried back with him a knowledge of the distant scene. Dwelling upon\nthese cases in the \"Note on a Suggested Mode of Psychical Interaction\"\nin which, in Phantasms of the Living, I discussed these present problems at\nsomewhat greater length, I remarked (Vol. II., p. 287) that I hoped soon\nto set forth further evidence for this type of telepathic communication.\nThe projected task has since been performed by Mrs. Sidgwick, whose two\npapers on \" The Evidence for Clairvoyance \" (S.P.R. Proceedings, Vol. VII.)\ninclude a collection of cases strong enough, I think, to have borne a heavier\nstress, in the way of corroborative and illustrative analogy, than she has\nthought fit to lay upon them in the present Report.\nI will add that the two experiences of Miss Danvers, given above,\u2014the\nfirst being one of apparent reciprocity, the second of telepathic clairvoyance,\n\u2014 exemplify the kind of relation between these phenomena which I am sug\ngesting here.\nClass VI.\u2014We have briefly followed the main types of telepathic\nexperience for agent and percipient, assumed as persons incarnate like our\nselves. But we must needs consider now another class of apparitions\u2014a\nclass of which both Mr. Gurney and I felt bound, in Phantasms of the Living,\nto speak with extreme reserve, and which is still in the present Report treated\nwith caution ; but the evidence for which, nevertheless, has so increased since\nthe publication of Mr. Gurney's book that no discussion can now afford to\nneglect its difficult lessons. I speak, of course, of phantasmal appearances\nin which the agent appears to be a disembodied intelligence. I have no wish\nto press or hurry any man's belief ; but I think that if the testimony which\npoints in this direction continues to flow in as our Proceedings and Journal\nshow it to have flowed in during the eight years since Phantasms of the\nLiving appeared, it will soon become a rare exception for a student who\nattaches importance to any part of our evidence to refuse to admit the\noccasional occurrence of various forms of posthumous communication. But\nif this be once thoroughly admitted\u2014if the significance of this prodigious\nhypothesis sink deep into the mind\u2014it is plain that all theories as to the\nnature of telepathy between living men,\u2014nay, as to the nature of earthly\nlife itself\u2014must pause in suspense while the character of this telepathy\nin excelsis, of this transcendent life, is studied as far as human powers\nallow. Such a task, of course, lies outside the scope of this Report ;\nbut the mere knowledge that it has yet to be performed may well check our\n\fAppendix 0. 421\nconfidence in any explanation of telepathic phenomena on earth which claims\ncredit on the score of simplicity. Simple, as we esteem simplicity, no\nexplanation can be which has to make allowance for this inexplicable\nbridging, this inconceivable fusion between the material and the transcendent\nworlds.\nClass VII.\u2014And indeed if this new evidence be looked into, it is\nfound to suggest at every turn aspects of those more familiar phenomena\nnever suggested before. Take first the question of the symbolism of\nphantasmal pictures. In earlier discussions we had assumed, as almost self-\nevident, that the symbolism of a telepathic message,\u2014the details of the\nvision, the phrases of the utterance\u2014must needs emanate either from the\nagent's or from the percipient's mind. If they came from the percipient's\nmind, we assumed that, like the incidents of ordinary dream. they were due\nto a working-up and re-mixing of earthly, though perhaps latent, memories.\nBut these suppositions are now becoming in many cases altogether un\ncertain. As automatic script is analysed, as crystal visions are observed,\nespecially as the evidence of retrocognition and precognition\u2014the presenta\ntion of scenes past and future\u2014multiplies and is studied anew, it is found\nthat there are phantasmal presentations of many kinds in which no real clue\npoints us to any individual source. We seem in contact with a knowledge\nof whose origin or whose limits we have no indication. More than this it\nwould be premature to say ; but the possibilities thus shadowed must not\nbe forgotten in the discussion of subliminal messages even of an apparently\nmuch simpler type.\nClass VIII.\u2014Once more. Intermingled with all these phenomena at\nwhich we can manage to look from the mental side alone, we find another\ngroup, itself widely ramifying, in which, besides many phenomena on whose\nsubjectivity or objectivity it is hard to pronounce, there seem to be included\ncertain definite and permanent changes in the material, ponderable world.\nCollective percipience, on such a view as this, might often be the mere\nresult of an actual change in that part of the universe where the percipients\nwere assembled. Such a change might be perceived either subliminally and\nelectively, by some among the group who were specially gifted ; or, if the change\nwere sufficiently gross and palpable, it might be perceived supraliminally\nin the ordinary sensory fashion by all persons present. The step here taken\nseems a great one ; but it is perhaps less sudden than it seems. For every\ncase of telepathy involves, on any hypothesis, a modification of one small\npart of the material world\u2014namely, the cells of the percipient's brain,\nHow that modification is effected\u2014whether directly by the agent, or by the\npercipient himself,\u2014in obedience to a stimulus how received?\u2014we cannot\ntell. It is the very secret of life which confronts us here ; the fundamental\nantinomy between Mind and Matter. But such confrontations with meta\nphysical problems reduced to concrete form are a speciality of our research ;\nand I here say only that since this problem does already exist,\u2014since the\ncells are in fact altered either by the thought or along with it,\u2014we have no\nright to take for granted that the problem, when more closely approached,\nwill keep within its ancient limits, or that Mind, whose far-darting\nenergy we are now realising, must needs be always powerless upon aught but\n-the grey matter of the brain.\n\f422 Report on the Census of Hallucinations.\nThis brief review of the various classes of telepathic phantasm, or sub\nliminal message, which I think that the enquirer will ere long have to\nattempt to colligate and explain, may indicate the expansions which the\ntheory adopted in this Report seems to me likely ultimately to receive.\nThe Census itself, I admit, has added but little to our evidence of those\nrarer phenomena on which I may be thought to dwell with undue insistance.\nBut my general argument is little affected by any question as to the\nweight of the cases garnered in the immediate past, or in the immediate\npresent. A little sooner or a little later the main questions here raised\nmust inevitably confront us all. Like all influences which touch and modify\nman's living, material brain, telepathy must needs have a physical side to it\nas well as a psychical. It is, indeed, inconceivable that any one new physical\nlaw,\u2014a fresh etherial radiation or the like,\u2014can cover manifestations so far-\nreaching and so diversified, and of which the very alphabet is as yet scarcely\nknown. But, in however complex and latent a form, there must somewhere\nbe a physical structure, a physical concomitance for all these things ; and our\nsuccessors will have to bring out those potentialities, and to translate these\ncosmic mysteries into the two languages of spirit and of matter. Let the\nspeculations of this note, then, be accepted as a mere warning of difficulties\nyet to be encountered ;\u2014questions ready to spring upon us when a few more\nsteps of our progress shall have been achieved.

M.\n\fSupplement.] 423\nReview.\nSUPPLEMENT.\nREVIEW.\nCock Lane and Common Sense. By Andrew Lang. Longmans, 1894.\nThough Mr. Lang does not wear the uniform of the Society for Psychical\nResearch, he is an effective ally whom we are glad to welcome in his\ncapacity of franc-tireur ; and if he has on former occasions had a playful\nhabit of firing a chance shot or two into the ranks of his friends, we\nhave pardoned this light-heartedness in consideration of his services as a\nskirmisher. And we notice with satisfaction that in his last volume he has\ncured himself even of this awkward tendency, and no longer rebukes us for\nignorance of the history of our own subject. It is only fair therefore that\nwe should frankly acknowledge the material addition which a study of\nCock Ltine and Common Sense is likely to make to the knowledge of our\nmembers concerning so much of Psychical Research as lies outside civilisa\ntion and the last twenty years.\nThat psychical phenomena are semper and nbique, that they are not con\nfined either to modern times or civilised races : these are Mr. Lang's main\nthemes ; and they lead him to enquire how far this wide dispersion in time\nand place may be taken to confirm the reality of the phenomena themselves.\nHis general position is already familiar to the readers of the Proceedings from\nthe essay entitled Comparative Psychical Research, reprinted in this volume,\nwith large additions, from the Contemporary Review, and noticed at some\nlength in the Proceedings, Part XXV. We will therefore only take for\nconsideration a few points while passing the volume rapidly in review.\nAfter an introductory chapter, we start on \" Savage Spiritualism \" and\n\"Ancient Spiritualism.\" On p. 81 Mr. Lang gives a curious table, on the\nmodel of that published by Mr. Myers in Proceedings XXV., p. 336,whichcon\nveniently summarises this part of his argument. He here compares the classes\nof phenomena experienced by Mr. Stainton Moses with those which are to be\nfound in ancient authors and in the performances of savage magicians. Out of\nthe twelve principal classes of Mr. Moses' phenomena as given by Mr. Myers,\nhe matches eight. The most universal of them is levitation, which is known to\nIamblichus, and is exhibited by the Eskimo and the Australians. St.\nJoseph of Cupertino was actually canonized, it appears, for his remarkable\nproficiency in the same experience which, in the case of Simon Magus, was\nheld to be undeniable proof of demoniac assistance. The evidence for St.\nJoseph, whose date is 1603-1663, is from the Acta Sanctorum. It should be\nadded that he, like Mr. Moses, was distinguished also by the supernormal\nproduction of fragrant scent. Mr. Lang adds that Iamblichus was also\nacquainted with the phenomenon of alteration in the bulk of the medium ;\n\f424 [Supplement.\nReview.\nthis, though not exhibited by Mr. Moses, is attested in the case of\nD. D. Home.\nThe chapters on \"Comparative Psychical Research \" and on \" Haunted\nHouses \" we must pass over : the former because it has already been noticed,\nand the latter as based almost entirely on the published work of the Society,\nwith little fresh matter of Mr. Lang's own. The next chapter, with the same\ntitle as the whole book, has been communicated to the Society as a paper\nread at one of the meetings, but has not before been published. In it Mr.\nLang examines some of the attempts to give rationalistic \" Common-sense \"\nexplanations of certain tales, including that of the famous Cock Lane ghost,\nand shews how miserably inadequate they are to account for the phenomena\nas recorded even by the sceptics themselves. He then passes on to \" Appari\ntions, Ghosts, and Hallucinations,\" and discusses the theory of ghosts,\nstrongly inclining to the conclusion that a ghost is not a mere hallucination,\nbut an entity actually present in space and capable of moving material\nobjects. But here he does not seem clearly to distinguish the cases where\nthe supposed action on the material object may itself be part of the hallucina\ntion. For instance, on p. 205 he quotes a ghost which lifted a mosquito\ncurtain. On this he triumphantly asks, \" Could a hallucination lift a\nmosquito curtain, or even produce the impression that it did so, while the\ncurtain was really unmoved ? \" One would have thought that the obvious\nanswer was \" Yes. When once the hallucination was generated, it might be\nexpected to be consistent, by doing whatever the living body which it simu\nlated was likely to do.\" What is needed is some evidence other than that of\nthe hallucinated subject that the curtain really was moved : and this,\noddly enough, does not seem to occur to Mr. Lang. Even in cases where a\nghost has been seen to open the door of a room and has been followed\nthrough the door, it is not a very violent supposition that the person who,\nex hypothesi, is hallucinated may unconsciously have opened the door and\npassed through it. At all events such evidence is not enough to establish\na theory of material ghosts without more decisive evidence ; and Mr. Lang,\nthough he mentions it, does not dispose of the old difficulty of the ghosts of\nclothes.\nThe next chapters, on \"Scrying or Crystal Gazing,\" \"Second Sight,\"\n\" Ghosts before the Law,\" \" A Modern Trial for Witchcraft \" (a French case\ntried in February, 1851, which, by the way, was not quite in the time of the\nThird Empire, as Mr. Lang says) and \" Presbyterian Ghost Hunters,\" we\nmust again pass over, though they all contain good reading. We may com\nplain perhaps that Mr. Lang lays himself open to the accusation which he\nbrings against Dr. Hibbert and his Philosophy ofApparitions (1825), of going\nback two centuries and neglecting the evidence which lies near at hand ; for\nin the chapter on \" Ghosts before the Law \" he merely mentions in a note at\nsecond hand a case both more recent and nearer home than any which he\ngives : a trial which took place in Dublin in 1885, and which ended, if my\nmemory serves me, in a verdict for Cock Lane, or at least against any possible\ncommon-sense explanation of the strange noises and more tangible\nphenomena which troubled the tenant of the Dublin house.\nIn the chapter on \"The Logic of Table-turning\" Mr. Lang effectively\nexposes the methods of M. de Gasparin on the one hand, and of Dr. Car\n\fSupplement.) 425\nReview.\npenter on the other. M. de Gasparin, who wrote on table-turning about\n1853, was a believer, not in spirits, but in a \" magnetic fluid,\" or will-force,\nwhatever one chooses to call it ; Dr. Carpenter, as we know, would explain\nall the phenomena by unconscious cerebration and muscular action. Mr.\nLang shews how each antagonist calmly ignores everything which does not\nfit in with his own theory. M. de Gasparin will have it that there are no\ngenuine phenomena, in spite of statements to the contrary, but those which\noccur in the presence of a chain of people formed to collect the animal\nmagnetism. Dr. Carpenter, whilo professing to refute M. de Gasparin,\ncoolly ignores his statements, which were of the essence of the argument,\nthat he had seen the table move without the contact of the hands of the\nchain. The moral is that we are only slowly beginning to learn what evidence\nmeans, and that till we have got a clearer idea on this head, we shall all be,\nprobably for a long time, fighting to a great extent in the air.\nThe last chapter, on \"The Ghost Theory of the Origin of Religion,\" is\nperhaps the most interesting in the book. But here on one or two points\nwe must join issue with Mr. Lang. He seems anxious to make out, while\nseeing the difficulties in the way, that the savage and ancient evidence for\nabnormal phenomena tends to establish their reality. In this we must\nentirely differ from him. In the first place, the evidence here is in no way\ncumulative. So large a proportion of striking stories breaks down on the\napplication of strict criticism that no accumulation of untested material can\nstrengthen the evidence. The presumption in each individual case of an\napparently supernormal occurrence is that it is untrue, until it has been\nexamined in a way in which we cannot examine any occurrence far removed\nin time, and in which I venture to think that no occurrence among savages\nhas yet been examined. The whole question must stand or fall solely on\nsuch testimony as is well within our reach : when we have once settled the\nreality of supernormal occurrences for ourselves we can approach the ques\ntion of supernormal occurrences among the ancients and uncivilised ;\nmeantime, we must be very careful that we do not attempt to reverse the\nprocess.\nBut, says Mr. Lang, \" the anthropological test of evidence for the\nabnormal and rejected phenomena is thus amply satisfied. Unless we say\nthat these phenomena are ' impossible,' whereas totemism, the couvade,\ncannibalism, are possible, the testimony to clairvoyance, and the other\npeculiar occurrences is as good in its way as the evidence for odd and\nscarcely credible customs and institutions.\" Surely the words \"belief\nin \" ought to be inserted before \" clairvoyance.\" The evidence is ample to\nshew that the belief exists ; but it can no more shew that the facts are real\nthan the evidence for the couvade can prove that it is the husband and not\nthe wife who is in fact the chief sufferer in childbirth, or than that for\ntotemism can convince us that certain kins are descended from certain\nbeasts or vegetables. If the anthropological evidence is to have any\neffect, the classification of clairvoyance with the couvade and totemism does\nnot seem to tend in the direction at which Mr. Lang is aiming. Anthropo\nlogy, as represented by Mr. Tylor, very properly confines itself to\nestablishing only the psychological facts on which the history of institutions\nis based ; the physical facts on which the psychological may themselves\n\f426 [Supplement.\nReview.\nrest must be studied in a different way altogether. The physical study may,\nand doubtless will, throw light on the psychological ; telepathy and clair\nvoyance, when finally proved, would make clear a great deal of what we are\ntold of biraarks, peaimen and angekuts. We may even\u2014who knows t\u2014find\nin sympathetic transference of pain a physical basis for the couvade, and\nDarwinism may have done something for totemism by proving the existence\nof a great monkey kinship. But totemism can hardly be quoted as evidence\nfor Darwinism, or Iamblichus and biraarks for Mr. Stainton Moses.\nWalter Leaf.\n\fEdmund Gurney Library. 427\nEDMUND GURNEY LIBRARY.\nSUPPLEMENTARY CATALOGUE, 1894.\nAdditions since the list in \" Proceedings,\" Vol. IX.\nENGLISH.\nBell (Dr.), Animal Electricity and Magnetism London, 1792\n'Courmelles (Dr. Foveau de), Hypnotism.
