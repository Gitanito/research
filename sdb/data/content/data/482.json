Private Meeting for Members and Associates.\nPRIVATE MEETING FOR MEMBERS AND ASSOCIATES.\nTHE 17th Private Meeting for Members and Associates only was\nheld in the large Hall at 2 0 Hanover Square, London, W., on Friday,\nDecember 14th, 1906, at 4 p.m.\u2014Sir Oliver Lodge in the chair.\nMiss ALICE JOHNSON read a paper on \" Some Recent\nSittings for Physical Phenomena in America,\" of which the\nfollowing is an abstract :\nSome time ago at one of the meetings of the Society, a\ndescription had been given by Dr. J. H. Gower of some\nremarkable physical phenomena\u2014in particular the movements\nof heavy tables untouched by any one and in a good light\u2014\nwhich he had witnessed in the course of the last few years\nin a private circle of his own friends, with no professional\nmedium among them, in a town in one of the Western\nStates of America. Dr. Gower having invited Miss Johnson\nto take part in these sittings, she went to America last\nAugust, and spent nearly a month in the town where they\nwere held, attending during that time eighteen sittings in four\ndifferent houses. The phenomena witnessed were\u2014she was told\n\u2014about up to the average level of the sittings, but no decisive\nmovements of large objects that were clearly without contact\nwith any of the sitters occurred. These, however, were stated\nto have happened only some half-a-dozen times during the\nfour or five years that the sittings had been going on.\nThe description of the sittings was prefaced by a brief\ndiscussion of the general value of evidence for physical\nphenomena. It was pointed out that this must from the\nnature of the case be less reliable than evidence for psychical\nphenomena, such as telepathy, since the latter is derived from\nmental impressions\u2014the only things of which we have any\ndirect knowledge\u2014whereas the former is derived from the\ninferences drawn from mental impressions as to what is\nhappening in the external world, and inferences may, of\ncourse, be fallacious.\nMoreover, since there is always the possibility that any indi\nvidual observation may be erroneous, more evidence is required\n\u2014and in practice is always demanded\u2014for the objective reality\nof events that are alleged to occur only very rarely than\nfor those that occur more frequently.\n\f4 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1907.\nMiss Johnson made the acquaintance of 21 of the sitters\n(besides Dr. Gower), who all talked freely to her about their\nprevious experiences, and gave all possible help in the investi\ngation. None of them was accustomed to go into trance, or\nto exhibit any of the usual symptoms of \" mediumship,\" but\nthe phenomena seemed chiefly to centre round one of them,\nhere called Mrs. Williams.\nThis lady was present at 12 of the sittings, 3 of which\nwere blanks. At the other 9, abundant raps were heard,\nboth when the sitters' hands were on the table, and to a\nless extent when they were off; tilts and other movements\nof the table occurred with the sitters' hands on it, and a\nfew movements apparently without contact.\nMiss Johnson came to the general conclusion that nearly\neverything she witnessed\u2014that is, not only the table-tiltings\nand movements with contact, but also the raps\u2014could be\nexplained by the automatic muscular action of the sitters. In\nthe case of the raps, several occasions were described in\ndetail when movements of the feet or knees\u2014either synchro\nnising with the raps or apparently connected with them\u2014\nwere observed. Miss Johnson believed, however, that these\nmovements were performed with complete unconsciousness.\nAt one sitting, the last at which Mrs. Williams was able\nto be present, she, Dr. Gower, and Miss Johnson, were sitting\nalone at a small four-legged table, which had a ledge connecting\nthe four legs at a height of 9f ins. from the floor. Twice this\ntable, after tilting on to one leg, gave a rapid jump and\ncame down on to the diagonally opposite leg, which alighted\nat a spot only an inch or two from where the first leg had\nstood, before the other legs fell to the ground. It will be\nseen that this movement involves all four legs being off\nthe ground at once. Later in the evening, the same table\nsuddenly rose horizontally to a height of 5 or 6 ins. from\nthe floor and went straight down again. In all cases, the\nhands of the three sitters named were resting on the surface\nof the table, and the only normal way of raising it under\nthese circumstances seemed to be by lifting the lower ledge\nwith the foot. Since the room was well lighted, and all that\nwent on was being carefully watched, it was very difficult to\nsuppose that any one of the sitters could have raised the\n\fJAN., 1907. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 5\ntable in this way without making some movement that would\nhave been visible to the others who were watching.\nMiss Johnson went on to discuss, in reference to the\nraps which she had described, the differences between fraudulent\nand automatic mediumistic phenomena, maintaining that the\nburden of proof rests with those who allege that an apparently\nfraudulent performance is automatic. No test is known by\nwhich it can be determined whether a given action is performed\nconsciously or not ; yet probably all competent persons who\nhave studied trance conditions are convinced that actions are\nsometimes performed entirely without the cognisance of the\nsupraliminal consciousness. In cases of automatism we find,\namong considerable variations of form, certain common character\nistics which it is by no means easy to simulate, partly perhaps\nbecause it is so difficult to formulate them ; and through\ncomparing what had occurred at these sittings with other cases\nshe had seen, Miss Johnson was personally convinced that the\nraps were produced automatically and not by deliberate intent,\nthough she recognised how slight the grounds for this opinion\nmust appear to any one else. She maintained that such an\nexplanation should be restricted to cases where there is strong\npositive ground for confidence in the honesty of the medium\nand where the phenomena are of a nature that does not\nrequire preparation, either in the way of long practice or of\napparatus. Thus in the case of Eusapia Paladino, the fraud\nmost clearly proved against her, viz. : making one hand or foot\ndo duty for two and so getting one free, is a well-known\ntrick, her extraordinary adeptness in which showed that she\nmust have practised it for a long time. Similarly the actions\nof mediums who have been caught personating \" spirit forms \"\nby means of drapery and other apparatus involving elaborate\npreparation, cannot of course be attributed to automatism.\nIt was obviously far more difficult\u2014though perhaps not\nquite impossible\u2014to apply the explanation of automatism to\nthe levitations of the table which Miss Johnson had witnessed,\nand it seemed altogether inapplicable to the more decisive\nmovements without contact that were reported by the other\nwitnesses to have occurred at the earlier sittings.\nHer observations on the raps, which were not associated\nexclusively with the presence of any one sitter, seemed to\n\f6 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1907.\nillustrate the infectious nature of automatic actions which\nhas often been observed in other cases, and tend perhaps to\nthrow light on the more wide-spread epidemic of rapping\nthat followed the outbreak in the Fox family in 1848. In\nthis case the rappings became pronounced in hundreds of\nfamilies in the Eastern States of America, and it seems\nreasonable to suppose that, while the phenomenon\u2014like the\ntable-tiltings that became so prevalent a few years later\u2014\nwas in some cases deliberately produced, in many others it\nwas genuinely automatic.\nMR. F. C. CONSTABLE asked whether the raps heard by Miss\nJohnson had any distinctive character, such as had been\ndescribed by Professor de Morgan and other early observers.\nIf so, it was difficult to suppose that they had been produced,\nas she had suggested, by a number of different movements\nmade by different persons.\nMiss JOHNSON replied that the raps, though very similar,\nwere not always exactly the same in sound : thus, once she\nthought they sounded like drops of water falling on a hard\nsurface, which was probably the kind of sound that Professor\nde Morgan had heard ; generally they resembled the different\nsounds that may be produced by the knocking or rubbing or\nscraping of various objects on one another.\nSIR OLIVER LODGE observed that supposing \" physical\nphenomena \" were genuine, it was probable that they were\nassociated with some cause or influence emanating from the\nbody of the medium. The occurrences sometimes were such\nAS to suggest a sort of nervous explosion or stimulus giving\nrise to muscular actions in the body at the same time that\nit affected objects at a little distance from the body. He\nbelieved that he had witnessed something of this kind in the\ncase of Eusapia Paladino ; especially on one occasion when,\nunder full control, in fair light, she made gestures towards\nan escritoire, and it moved slightly away from her at each\nof her movements, there being a clear space\u2014not less than\ntwo feet\u2014visible between her and it. If the force was not\nvery strong, it might be possible to move objects only very\nclose to the medium.\nMiss JOHNSON said that she agreed in thinking the theory\nof physical phenomena suggested by Sir Oliver Lodge was the\n\fJAN., 1907. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 7\nmost probable one, but pointed out that if objects could only\nbe moved when they were very close to the medium, it became\nextremely difficult to prove that any supernormal force was\ninvolved.\nA GENTLEMAN remarked that if these supposed supernormal\nforces existed, one would expect them to be occasionally\nmanifested in a disturbing way in the ordinary operations,\ne.g. of machinery ; since among the thousands of persons engaged\nin working machinery, a few might be expected to possess\nmediumistic powers. Also when sitting at a table to play\ncards, as so many people did constantly, one would expect\nthat raps or levitations would sometimes happen. The fact\nthat these occurrences only seemed to happen when people\nwere \" sitting for \" them suggested that they might often be\nillusions due to expectancy.\nSIR OLIVER LODGE said he thought the objections raised by\nthe last speaker reasonable ; but that there were two possible\nanswers to them, (1) if machinery often went wrong in the\npresence of any particular workman, it was very likely that\nhis post would be given to somebody else ; (2) that these\nphenomena\u2014if genuine at all\u2014were certainly very rare and\nmight easily escape observation on many occasions when they\ndid occur ; especially since they only seemed to happen in\nthe presence of exceptional people, and perhaps only when\nthese were in an exceptional state. We were still so ignorant\nof the whole matter that we did not really know what to\nexpect ; but one thing he felt assured of, viz. that illusion\nor hallucination was not the explanation of the abnormal\nmovements he himself had observed.\nMRS. SIDGWICK, in reference to the question of hallucinations\noccurring at seances, said that there were several instances\nrecorded of figures which were clearly hallucinatory being seen\nat D. D. Home's stances.\nMiss JOHNSON said that she had gone to these sittings with\nthe idea that hallucination was a possible explanation of the\nresults reported, but though she still regarded it in general\nas the most rational explanation of any \" physical phenomena \"\nnot produced by normal causes, such as fraud or automatism,\nshe had come to the conclusion that it was not at all events\nthe main factor in this case. In reply to a question from\n\f8 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1907.\nMr. Piddington as to whether she thought the levitations of the\ntable which she had described could have been hallucinatory,\nshe replied that if the case were to be explained on that\nground, all that need be supposed would be that one of the sitters\nraised the table by normal means, and perhaps automatically :\nwhile the two others\u2014or perhaps all three\u2014had a negative\nhallucination in regard to the movement by which it was\ndone. This would be similar to what constantly happens\nin conjuring performances, when the particular action that\ndoes the trick escapes the notice of the spectators.\nMYSTEEIOUS LIGHTS.\nTHE following paper on some mysterious lights seen in Bay\nChaleur, New Brunswick, appeared in the Bulletin of the\nNatural History Society of New Brunswick, No. XXIV.,\nVol. V., Part IV, 1906, under the title \"The Fact Basis\nof the Fire (or Phantom) Ship of Bay Chaleur,\" and was\nsent to Mr. Fryer by the author, Mr. W. F. Ganong, by\nwhose kind permission it is reprinted here. The subject is\nof interest in connection with the somewhat similar lights\nseen in connection with the religious revival in Wales,\nwhich were described in Mr. Fryer's paper in Part LI. of\nthe Proceedings.\nOne cannot be long in the Bay Chaleur country, especially its\neastern part, without hearing of the fire (or phantom) ship, said\noften to be seen on the bay. Until a short time ago I regarded\nthe fire-ship as a pure fiction, with no basis other than the proneness\nof humanity to see wonders where they are expected, or where\nothers say they exist. But as a result of two visits to that country,\nduring which I questioned many residents on the subject, I have\nhad to change my opinion ; and I now believe there is really some\nnatural phenomenon in that region which manifests itself in such a\nway as to be imaginable as a vessel on fire.\nFirst we note the literature of the subject. Naturally the imagin\native writers who have visited Bay Chaleur have seized upon the\nstory of the fire-ship as a rare treasure, and .adding to the wildest\nlocal tales sundry fanciful imaginings of their own, with embellish\nments of banshees, pirates or picturesque historical personages, have\nproduced weird fantasies such as are preferred to truth even by\n\fJAN., 1907. Mysterious Lights. 9\ngrown-up persons. A type of such stories is found in Miss E. B.\nChase's Quest of the Quaint (Philadelphia, 1902), which connects the\nship with the voyages of the Cortereals, making it a vessel set on\nfire by one of them when attacked by the Indians. From such a\ntreatment there is every gradation, through many newspaper, guide\nbook and other accounts up to serious descriptions of the phenomenon\nas something with a probable fact basis. The best account of the\nlatter type that I have seen, written apparently by Mr. A. M. fielding,\nappeared some years ago in the St. John Sun. It reads in part as-\nfollows :\n\" The extent to which a visitor may be impressed by the story\nof the phantom ship depends a good deal on the source of the\ninformation. Hon. Robert Young [of Caraquet] will tell you, for\nexample, that frequently at night before a storm a large light may\nbe seen on the surface of the bay. It may be seen in winter, when\nthe ice has formed, as well as in summer, and it is not confined\nto any one portion of -he bay. Sometimes it is much brighter than\nat other times and appears to dance along the surface. Joseph\nPoirier said he had seen it so bright that the reflection would appear\non the houses at Grande Anse. Rev. Father Allard said he had\nseen it several times this season. In fact it appears to be quite a\ncommon phenomenon, though nobody is able to explain its cause. . . .\nThose who decline to place full reliance in this interesting story [viz.\nthe fanciful legend] nevertheless admit that sometimes the mysterious\nlight emits rays that shoot into and athwart the gloom, and might\nby a particularly well-nourished imagination be likened to the flame-\nlit rigging of a ship.\"\nThe information I have myself been able to collect from those\nwho have seen the light is as follows. Of course I have sifted all\ntestimony to the best of my ability, eliminating all exaggerations\nand embellishments, whether these be due to the habit of all\nhumanity to make a story as big and good as possible, or to the\ncommon tendency to gull an impressionable stranger, or to mere\nignorance, superstition or mendacity.\nFour years ago Captain Turner of Riverside, Albert County, a\nclear-headed sea captain, told me, in answer to my mention of the\nfire-ship as a freak of the imagination, that he had himself seen it\nand hence knew it to exist. Later, on my first visit to Caraquet,\nI was told by a lady in whose word I have absolute confidence,\nthat her attention was attracted one night by a light off Caraquet,\nwhich looked so much like a vessel afire that she supposed it to be\n\f10 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAS., 1907.\none of her husband's schooners, and called him in alarm, only to\nfind that it was the fire-ship. A prominent resident of Miscou, Mr.\nJames Harper, told me he has seen it but once, in the winter on\nthe ice off Clifton. It was seemingly some ten miles away and kept\nrising and falling, dying down to a very small scarcely visible flame,\nthen rising slowly into a column \"looking thirty feet high.\" It\nwas not in the form of a ship, but a column, but people told him\nit was the fire-ship. He was told it preceded a storm, but he\ntook notice and no storm followed. Mr. Robert Wilson of Miscou,\nwho sails much on Bay Chaleur, tells me he has seen the fire-ship\n(or as he calls it, the \"burning ship\") several times. The time\nhe was nearest it was about eleven years ago off Caraquet on a very\ndark night. The light appeared ahead, and finally he came near\nand passed within 100 yards to windward of it, so that he saw it\nwith perfect clearness. It was somewhat the shape of a half-moon\nresting on the water, flat side down, or like a vessel on the water\nwith a bowsprit but no masts, etc., and \"all glowing like a hot coal.\"\nHe dared not run nearer and passed it, keeping his eyes upon it\nuntil far beyond. On other occasions he has seen it, at various\n\u2022distances, and has come to pay little attention to it. Sometimes\nit looked somewhat like a ship, sometimes not, and sometimes it\nvanished while he was watching it. Usually it is dancing or vibrat\ning. Again he has seen it as one tall light which would settle down\nand rise again as three, which would again settle, and so on.\nRecently I have been told by Dr. J. Orne Green of Boston, whose\nconnection with Miscou is mentioned below, that Mr. Wilson reports\nseeing the light this (1905) autumn; it appeared ahead of his boat\nas he sailed up the bay, vanished as he neared it, and in a few\nminutes re-appeared astern. Mr. Andrew Wilson, another leading\nresident of Miscou, has also seen it, when it resembled a whaleboat,\nnot a ship, in form. Mr. M'Connell, keeper of the light at Miscou\nGulley, tells me that he has seen the fire-ship, about two miles\naway, but it did not look to him like a ship, but more like a big\nbonfire. Several others have told me that they have seen it (the\ngreat majority, of the residents in the region averring that they\nhave seen it at one time or another), most of them agreeing that\nat times it looks like a ship on fire, but at others more like a\nround light. All agree that it usually precedes a storm, and is\nseen over the ice in winter as well as over the water in summer.\nOn the other hand, other trustworthy residents of Miscou, notably\nMr. Jas. Bruno and Mr. Ed. Vibert, both of whom sail much on\n\fJAN., 1907. Mysterious Lights. 11\nthe bay, tell me they have never seen it, and do not believe in its\nexistence.\nSo much for local testimony. But it receives confirmation from\nanother source. For many years past Dr. J. Orne Green of Boston,\na Professor in the Harvard Medical School, has spent several weeks\non Miscou and has taken a great interest in all that relates to the\nregion. He tells me that he has himself seen a light which he\nwas told was the fire-ship. Many years ago when running at night\ntowards Caraquet he saw a fire off in the bay, and called the attention\nof his companions to it, but finally thought it must be a woods fire\non the north side of the bay. Reaching Caraquet, however, he\nfound the people excited, because they said the fire-ship was out\nin the bay. He told them of his belief that it was a woods fire,\nbut they declared this could not be, because it had moved. The\nwind at the time was gentle, from the southwest, but it was\nfollowed the next day by a great northwester. His interest being\nthus aroused Dr. Green, in later years, attempted to investigate the\nphenomenon. He found that it was reported not only in Bay Chaleur\nbut also in the Gulf of St. Lawrence as far south as Northumberland\nStraits. He came to the conclusion that while the stories were\nmostly exaggerated and distorted there was nevertheless some basis\nfor them in fact, and that there does occur in this region some\nnatural light of the general nature of \"St. Elmo's Fire.\" This was\nexactly the conclusion to which I had come independently, as stated\nin this note when originally read before this Society.\nGrouping together all the evidence it seems plain,\u2014first, that a\nphysical light is frequently seen over the waters of Bay Chaleur\nand vicinity ; second, that it occurs at all seasons, or at least in winter\nas well as in summer ; third, that it usually precedes a storm ; fourth,\nthat its usual form is roughly hemispherical with the flat side to\nthe water, and that at times it simply glows without much change\nof form, but that at other times it rises into slender moving columns,\ngiving rise to an appearance capable of interpretation as the flaming\nrigging of a ship, its vibrating and dancing movements increasing\nthe illusion ; fifth, its origin is probably electrical, and it is very\nlikely a phase of the phenomenon known to sailors as St. Elmo's\nlire.\nI have, of course, made efforts to ascertain if any such phenomenon\nis known elsewhere in the world. Professor R. De C. Ward, Assistant\nProfessor of Climatology in Harvard University, writes me that he\nknows of no record of a similar phenomenon, and no development\n\f12 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1907.\nof St. Elmo's Fire so great that it could be mistaken for a burning\nship. Professor A. H. Pierce, my companion in my visit to this\nregion last summer, has, however, called my attention to references to\nan allied subject in the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research,\n[Vol.] XII. (1905), 108, and again in the Proceedings of the same\nSociety, [Vol.] XIX. (1905), 80, where an account is given of lights\nclaimed to have been seen around Tremadoc Bay in Wales ; but the\nconclusion is reached that in all probability they have onty a\nsubjective basis, though the statement is also made that lights of\nunexplained origin were reported as common on the Welsh coast\nover two hundred years ago. It is also of interest to note that\nSch'mitt's newly published Monographic de I'Isle d'Anticosli (57) men\ntions manifestations of St. Elmo's Fire observed at that island. . . .\nAs to the natural features of the country, both in Wales\nand New Brunswick, where these lights are seen, Miss G-. L.\nElles, Lecturer in Geology at Newnhara College and Assistant\nDemonstrator in Geology to the Woodwardian Professor at\nCambridge, writes to us :\nOctober list, 1906.\n... On the subject of the mysterious \"lights\" said to have been\nseen in Wales in connection with the recent religious revival, I [have\nconsulted] a geological friend of mine who has been working in the\nTremadoc district for several years past. . . . He agrees with me\nthat the country all round Tremadoc Bay is just the place where\none might reasonably expect natural emanations of gas. The ground\nis for the most part very boggy and marshy, and even up on the\nhills behind, in all the places where, so far as I can gather, the\n\"lights\" have been seen, there are considerable tracts of bog land.\nMy friend has seen them himself at Tremadoc, and is satisfied as\nto their occurrence in these places. He also says that he has noticed\na similar sort of light visible at some distance which must have\nbeen caused by decaying animal matter in a ditch. The phenomenon\nis generally noticeable when the barometer is low ; that is, of course,\n[it] is directly connected with the state of the atmosphere at the\ntime. I do not think the geological formation has anything to do\nwith it more than that boggy land is apt to result from the wear\nand tear of certain rock types rather than others.\nSo far as I can ascertain,\u2014but I have been unable to verify this\nabsolutely,\u2014there are similar sorts of shale and slate rocks abutting\non Bay Chaleur, and therefore probably there is boggy land there\n\fJAN., 1907. Mysterious Lights. 13\nalso, but these are not of the same age as those of Tremadoc Bay,\nthough both are Palaeozoic. I consider, therefore, that you might\nget similar phenomena wherever bog land was present, provided that\nthe state of the atmosphere was suitable. With regard to the fact\nthat the light at Bay Chaleur was seen on the water, it is perfectly\npossible for the gas to move out over the water as well as anywhere\nelse, and it frequently assumes the most curious forms.\nG. L. ELLES.\nMr. Ganong writes to Mr. Fryer on the same subject as\nfollows :\nNORTHAMPTON, MASS., November 6th, 1906.\n. . . As to Chaleur Bay where the lights are seen, I know the\nregion well. There is really no boggy or marshy land around it.\nOn the north side, the coast rises abruptly into beautiful mountains,\nrising in the interior to over four thousand feet. The south coast\nis low and composed of sandstones, sometimes forming bluffs of\n\u2022one hundred feet, sometimes sinking to sea level, and overlaid by\nthe sand beaches. I do not think there is any low ground or\nmarshy or boggy borders on the bay except in very few and local\nplaces. However, this coast is steadily sinking, and it is possible\nthat bogs and marshes had existence where there is now ocean.\nThere is no shale or solid rocks in the vicinity where the lights\nare seen, only sandstones, etc. A point of possible importance,\nhowever, occurs to me. These sandstones are of the same character\nas others in the south of New Brunswick, which contain oil,\nthough, so far as I know, no such substance is known around Bay\n\u2022Chaleur. As to the depth of the bay, it increases steadily outward\nfrom the coast. I enclose a sketch map giving the principal\n\u2022details taken from the official Admiralty chart of the bay. The\nlights are seen at all distances from the shore, sometimes so close\nas to seem in Caraquet Harbor, less than a mile across, at other\ntimes so distant that they could be taken for lights across the\nbay which is thirty miles distant. The fishermen say they are\nrather frequent near the herring banks, some two or three miles from\nthe coast. I think these points cover all the inquiries in your\nletter. Since my article was written, I have received two or three\nletters from observers who know the lights well, and they strongly\nconfirm the correctness of the chief statements in my article.

JAN., 1907.\nA MEDICAL SOCIETY FOR THE STUDY OF\nHYPNOTISM.\nTHE General Practitioner for November 24th, 1906, announces\nthat a meeting of medical men was held at the residence of\nDr. Lloyd Tuckey, 88 Park Street, Grosvenor Square, London,\non Thursday, November 8th, 1906, with the object of forming\na Society of Registered Medical Practitioners who are interested\nin the study and practice of hypnotic suggestion : the aims\nof such society being to facilitate the study thereof, and bring\nits claims as a therapeutic agent more prominently before the\nprofession at large. Letters of apology were read from Sir\nFrancis Cruise, M.D., of Dublin ; Dr. George Kerr, of Edin\nburgh ; Dr. Edwin Ash, of London ; Dr. Montague Rust,\nNewport, Fife ; Dr. Hope Simpson, Liverpool ; and Dr. Woods,\nHarley Street, London. The society was constituted under\nthe title, proposed by Dr. Bramwell, of \" The Medical Society\nfor the Study of Suggestive Therapeutics,\" and Dr. Lloyd\nTuckey was unanimously elected as its first President. Dr.\nA. Betts Taplin, of Sefton Park, Liverpool, was elected Hon.\nSecretary, and Dr. Douglas Bryan, of Leicester, Treasurer. The\nfollowing rule as to membership of the new Society was\npassed : \" That the membership of the society be limited to-\nregistered medical practitioners ; and secondly, that no such\nshall be eligible for membership who are connected in any\nway with any non-medical society which has for its object\nthe treatment of disease by unqualified persons, whether by\nhypnotism or otherwise.\" About thirty medical men have\nalready joined the Society, amongst whom, besides those\nmentioned above, are : Dr. R. W. Felkin, of Kensington, Drs.\nM'Clure and MacLennan, of Glasgow, Dr. Hugh Wingfield,\nof Winchester, Dr. Percy Allan, of Croydon, etc.\nIt is hoped that in time this Society may rival in im\nportance the nourishing French Societe d'Hypnotisme et de\nPsychologie. Its formation in any case marks an important step\nin the study of Hypnotism in England. Though it was to\nEnglish medical men\u2014in especial, Braid, Elliotson and Esdaile\u2014\nthat so much of the early progress in Hypnotism was due, in\nlater years English medical science has lagged behind that of\nother countries in this subject. The more recent revival of\n\fJAN., 1907.

PHENOMENA.\nWE print the following account received a year or two\nago from Cesarea, Turkey, as an illustration of the similarity\nof phenomena of this kind in all parts of the world. The\naccount strongly suggests that the scratching and raps were\nmade unconsciously and automatically by the medium himself,\nas was thought by Miss Johnson to be the case in the sittings\ndescribed at the meeting of the Society reported above. We\nhave tried in vain to obtain a further report and more\ndetailed observations of the case. The account has been\nverbally modified in the few places where the writer's English\nrequired correction.\nTATAS, CESAREA, TURKEY, February 22nd, 1905.\nI am an Armenian Protestant, a graduate of Central Turkey\nCollege in Aintab, and now a teacher in the American Boys' School\nin Talas. I am very much interested in psychology, and should\nlike you to know the result of my investigation, which I am still\ncarrying on.\nIn Cesarea there is a house in which a man, 24 years old, lives\nwith his wife. The man has a gloomy and peculiar look. He\ntalks when asleep, sometimes swoons He is a poor, common^\nuneducated man. Before he moved into this house he was told\nthe house was haunted by a ghost. He says he did not mind it.\nHe worked in the dark and damp cellar of a room in the house\na long time. About two months ago he began to hear some\nscratching sound on the mat on which he sat. Finding no animal\nor a man that could make the sound, he was startled, also his\nwife and others. Then there was heard in the floor and in other\nparts of the room some raps, which the people in the house found\nto be able to answer questions. So many men and women visited\nthe house and asked questions, which were answered rightly. I\nwent too, and asked many questions whose answers \/ knew. The\nnumber of the raps was right. I must tell you that I asked the\nquestions in English, and no one of the persons knew English there.\nSome of the questions were : \" How old am I ? \" \" How many\npounds did I pay to the rug-seller to-day ? \" etc. Although a few\nof the answers were wrong, most of them were right. Then I\nbegan to ask some questions whose answers 1 did not know, but\nthe answers were not right. For example, I took a handful of\n\f16 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1907.\nmoney without looking at my purse and asked, \"How many piasters\nhave I in my hand?\" I repeated this three times, and the answers\nwere two less than in my hand ; that is, the number of raps were\n25, 7, 39, instead of 27, 9, 41, which were right. Yet I heard a\nscratching after the raps in all cases when the answers were wrong.\nI asked, \"If you are a ghost rap five times,\" and the answer\nwas five raps. I said again, if you are a girl's ghost, rap so many,\n\u00abtc. I asked many questions that I need not mention to you, as\nI have not any definite idea of them. But the following points are\nespecially to be noted. (1) The man mentioned seems to be a\nmedium because (a) the raps will occur in his presence, (b) around\nhim, and (c) if he asks a question the raps are more intense, (d)\nand, according to his statement, when he is sure that the answer will\nbe right, it is so, otherwise wrong. (1) The man has some peculiar\nlook and mental state as stated above. (3) In the presence of\nsceptical people this will not occur in general. (4) The raps were\nweak at the start, then it grew louder and more frequent, now it\ngrows weaker. (5) The raps are louder and more frequent in the\nnight than in the daytime. (6) I tried to find out if there is\nany fraud in the matter, but I could not find anything. (7)\nHundreds of people visited the house without paying anything.\nLEVON S.

Gerald W. Balfour, in the chair.\nMB. W. M'DouGALL read a paper on \" The Case of Sally\nBeauchamp,\" which is published in Part LII. of the\nProceedings.\nThe principal conclusions arrived at by the author of the\npaper were that the two personalities known as B i. and B iv.\nmight fairly be regarded as the products of a division of the\noriginal normal personality, but that the personality known\nas \" Sally \" could not be so regarded. He maintained that we\nhad not yet achieved a conception of human personality which\nwould enable us to account satisfactorily for the principal\nfeatures of this remarkable case. He did not think that\nMr. Myers's \" subliminal self \" was such a conception.\nMB. F. PODMOEE said it appeared to him that the case could\nbe explained on the same psycho-physical principles as the\nmore common types of multiple personality, and that there\nwas no ground for regarding \" Sally \" as a separate soul. No\ndoubt, as Mr. M'Dougall had said, the personalities Bi. and\nB iv. were co-ordinate, while \"Sally\" was somewhat different\nfrom them ; but he thought that two characteristics gave a\npossible clue to her nature : (1) Her memory was far more\nextensive than that of B i. and Biv., in which respect it\nresembled hypnotic memory; (2) her character, behaviour,\nand acquirements were like those of a child of about 14 ;\nshe had not the mental qualities or knowledge of B I. and B iv.\nIt might be supposed that, while the consciousnesses of B I and\nB iv. were represented on the physical side by a functional\ndiscontinuity in the elements of the adult brain , \" Sally \" was\n\fFEB., 1907. . . General Meeting.\nconditioned by a discontinuity between the less mature and\nthe adult elements, and represented the temporary predomin\nance of the immature elements. If so, she would be, like\nthe other personalities, merely a dissociated part of the\ncomplete normal personality.\nDR. M'CLUEE observed that the function of the brain was\nto think, and in the living organism the brain was necessary\nfor this purpose. But it was uncertain whether structure\npreceded function or the reverse. It was possible that thought\nmight strike out paths in the brain and use it as an instrument\nto play on ; and he believed the notion that thought was a\nmere emanation from the brain was now discarded.\nMR. F. C. CONSTABLE said he thought the word \" subliminal \"\nwas used by Mr. Myers in two different senses, viz. : (1) in\nthe sense of a store of submerged memories and experiences,\n(2) in the sense of the real essential personality or soul which\nsurvives death. But was the personality the same throughout\nlife? The child of 2 was not the same as the adult man, who,\nagain, was not the same as the old man. The personality\nat any period seems to be nothing more than a synthesis of\nall the mental states and feelings of that period, which are\nconstantly changing into other mental states. The different\npersonalities of Miss B. should perhaps be regarded as nothing\nmore than a series of shifting syntheses.\nMR. C. D. BADLAND asked whether it was not possible that\n\" Sally \" could be explained as a delusion on the part of Miss B.\nIt was not uncommon for persons in abnormal mental con\nditions to fancy themselves to be somebody else.\nMR. G-. CALDERON supported the same theory. He main\ntained that \" Sally \" did not seem like a real entity, as she\nhad not always the same character. Most people had\noccasional impulses to behave in a way just opposite to their\nordinary normal behaviour, and this seemed an exaggerated\ncase of the kind. \" Sally \" was very similar to the fictitious\npersonalities that often appear in trance conditions and are\nobviously dramatisations.\nTHE PRESIDENT, in answer to the last two speakers, said\nhe thought that no one who had read Dr. Morton Prince's\nfull account of the case could doubt that \" Sally \" was at least\nas real a personality as any of the others, since she had a\n\f22 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1907.\ncontinuous existence, concomitant with the other personalities\nand not merely alternating with them. Nor did he think\nMr. Podmore's explanation compatible with the facts of\nthe case. Mr. M'Dougall had discussed the applicability\nof the monistic and two different varieties of the dualistic\ndoctrine from a psychological point of view ; he thought\nthe ultimate court of appeal must after all be the meta\nphysical court. Mr. M'Dougall's conclusions, as he himself\npointed out, could not be considered altogether satisfactory,\nsince the theory on which he explained \" Sally \" was incom\npatible with the theory on which he explained the other\npersonalities ; but he had perhaps increased his own difficulties\nby taking the most extreme forms of the two varieties of\nthe dualistic hypothesis. Some via media might possibly be\nfound. The speaker agreed with Mr. M'Dougall in thinking\nthat Myers's theory of the subliminal self did not help to\nexplain the case, this being the doctrine of the soul in its\nmost extreme form, regarding it as completely independent of\nthe body, which only hampers its proper activity. For his\nown part, he thought the soul was neither entirely dependent\non the nervous system, nor entirely independent of it and\nself-sufficing. The mental content was doubtless the expres\nsion of the soul's interaction with its environment ; but it\ncould not be without environment, whether in or out of the\nbody, and therefore could not be without content. He had\nalready ventured to express the opinion that the evidence\npointed to a psychical as well as a physical environment even\nwithin the bodily organism itself ; and the case of \" Sally \"\nseemed to support this view.\nME. M'DOUGALL, in replying to the comments that had\nbeen made, said that since Dr. M'Clure assumed the theory\nthe validity of which he had been discussing, he had nothing\nto say in reply. He thought that Mr. Podmore in his explana\ntion of the case had ignored one fundamental factor of it,\nnamely, that \" Sally,\" unlike the other personalities, had a\ncontinuous existence from the early infancy of Miss B. up to\nthe present day; she did not alternate with B i. and Biv.,\nbut co-existed with them. Nor did it appear to him that she\nwas like a hypnotic personality, since it was by no means\nalways the case that the hypnotic memory was more extensive\n\fFEB., 1907. General Meeting. 23\nthan the normal one. He did not agree with Mr. Constable\nin regarding a personality as a mere succession of syntheses ;\nhe thought the formation of a normal personality was a\nprocess of continued growth and change rather than a\nsuccession of different personalities ; the mind of an adult\nwas not identical with the mind of a child, but had grown\nout of it as the body grows. He thought the suggestion of\nthe next two speakers, that \" Sally \" was a dramatisation or\nfictitious personality, had been sufficiently dealt with by the\nPresident, and could not be seriously maintained in face of\nthe facts. With regard to the President's own remarks he\ncould not agree that we must appeal in the last resort to\nmetaphysics ; he thought such appeals had in the past been\nfutile, and were likely to be always so. To his mind the great\ninterest and value of the present case lay in its affording\nempirical data which might possibly throw light on the nature\nof personality and the relation between mind and matter.\nEEPOET OF THE COUNCIL FOE THE YEAE 1906.\nTHE membership of the Society has increased considerably\nduring this year. 27 new Members (including one Honorary\nMember) were elected and one Associate became a Member ;\n100 new Associates were elected and two Members became\nAssociates. On the other hand, the total loss in numbers\nfrom various causes was 19 Members and 74 Associates,\nleaving a net increase of 37. The total membership has\nnow reached 939, the numbers being distributed as follows :\nMembers 258 (including 30 Honorary and Corresponding\nMembers) ; Associates 681 (including 13 Honorary Associates) .\nThe death of Dr. Eichard Hodgson at the end of 1905\nand the difficulty of finding a suitable successor to him as\nSecretary to the American Branch made it necessary for the\nCouncil to reconsider the position of the Branch in relation\nto the Parent Society. They therefore asked Mr. Piddington\nto go to America in order to confer on the spot with the\nAmerican Vice-Presidents of the Society and officials of the\nBranch as to the desirability of its being continued, giving\nhim full powers to act on their behalf in all matters relating\nto it. Mr. Piddington accordingly went to Boston in May,\n\fco \u2022o\nen\nrH\nCO\n01\nCCO\nOM 3,,\nsoo\nr* <\nX\nr\nI\n\u00ab\u00ab\u00bb\u00ab \u00ab\ncoiAcom o\nrH r-1 rH\n-\niii\n*>\u00a3 | S: ja \"\njiia i\nPH 3\n\u00abrH <\n3 Isss\n\u00ab ' OOO\nh rH\nO OOlO\nrH i\u20141\n\u00ab\n1-1 .

FEB., 1907.\nand in conjunction with Professor James, Professor Hyslop\nand Mr. G. B. Dorr decided, as announced in the Journal\nfor June, that the American Branch should be dissolved at\nthe end of 1906. The records accumulated at the offices of\nthe Branch have been sent to London and selections from\nthem will in course of time be published. Opportunity has\nbeen given to members of the Branch to transfer their\nmembership to the Parent Society on certain conditions,\nwithout the usual formalities, and nearly 200 members have\nso far availed themselves of this opportunity, so that this\nnumber will shortly be added to the figures of membership\ngiven above.\nAs stated by Mr. Piddington in the Journal for July, the\ndissolution of the Branch was decided on for the two following\nreasons : (1) because no suitable successor to Dr. Hodgson\nwas in sight ; (2) because it is desirable to lighten as far\nas possible the routine work in England. Professor Hyslop's\nscheme for an American Institute for Scientific Eesearch,\nof which one main department should be for psychical\nresearch, removed the one great objection to the policy of\ndissolution by making it clear that this would not involve the\nabandonment of organised psychical research in America.\nThis Institute has now been founded, and the first number\nof its Journal has already been issued. It is hoped that\nvaluable work will be done in America through its means.\nOne important event of the year in England has been the\npublication of Mrs. Verrall's report on the experiments in\nautomatic writing which she has been carrying on for some\ntime and is still continuing.\nIt will be remembered that about three years ago a valuable\ncollection of automatic drawings by Mrs. Alaric Watts was\npresented to the Society through the instrumentality of Mr.\nDouglas Murray and Sir William Crookes. This year a large\nnumber of other drawings and paintings produced by Mrs.\nWatts in the same way have been added to the gift, and\nthe whole forms a very complete series, which illustrates in\nan interesting manner the gradual development from rough\nand rudimentary figures and sketches to very elaborate and\nbeautiful designs and drawings, generally of a highly decorative\nkind.\n\fFEB., 1907. Report of the Council for the Year 1906. 27\nIn August Miss Johnson went to America in order to\nattend some sittings for physical phenomena with private\npersons\u2014no professional medium being present\u2014to which she\nhad been invited by Dr. J. H. Gower. The expenses of the\njourney were defrayed by the generosity of a member of\nthe Society, who made an anonymous gift to its funds for\nthe purposes of this and another investigation. Eighteen\nsittings were held, some of which were practically blank,\nwhile at others phenomena occurred apparently of the same\nkinds as those reported in the earlier sittings of the circle,\nbut less marked in degree. Miss Johnson's report on these\nsittings was read at the meeting of the Society held in\nDecember.\nTwo General Meetings and four Private Meetings of the\nSociety (for Members and Associates only) were held during\nthe year. The dates and papers read were as follows.\n* January 26th. \"Some Objects and Methods of Work in\nPsychical Research,\" by Professor W. F. Barrett.\nMarch 30th. \" Some Observations and Experiences reported\nby Mr. W. G. Grottendieck,\" by the Hon. Everard\nFeilding.\nMay 21st. \"A Discussion of Mme. X.'s Greek Script,\" by\nthe Eev. M. A. Bayfield.\nJuly 4th. \" A Case illustrating some Phases of Hypnotic\nPersonality,\" by Mr. G. Lowes Dickinson.\n* November 12th. \" Presidential Address,\" by the Eight\nHon. Gerald W. Balfour.\nDecember 14th. \" Some Eecent Sittings for Physical\nPhenomena in America,\" by Miss Alice Johnson.\nCASE.\nL. 1156. Collective (?) Apparition.\nTHE following case was received through Mr. Andrew Lang ;\nsome other experiences of Miss Grieve, the lady who con\ntributes it, have already appeared in the Journal (see Vol. X.,\np. 134 and p. 260). These were: some cases of crystal\nvisions, one of which\u2014viz., some pyramids with a train of\nloaded camels passing in front of them\u2014was seen collectively\n* Those marked with an asterisk were General Meetings.\n\f28 Journal of Socitty for Psychical Research. FEB., 1907.\nby Miss Grieve and a friend of her looking in the same\ncrystal ; and some experiments in thought-transference tried\nwith this and another friend.\nIn the case now given, it seemed as if Miss Grieve's\nhallucination was shared by her dog. Some other instances\nof the apparent sharing of hallucinations by animal and human\npercipients were given in the \" Report on the Census of\nHallucinations\" (see Proceedings S.P.E., Vol. X., pp. 326-330),\nwhere it is pointed out that it is necessarily very difficult to\nprove the participation of the animal in the hallucination,\nbecause, as animals cannot describe what they see and hear, we\ncan only infer it from their behaviour, for which there may be\nother causes besides the apparition. Sometimes it is at least as\nplausible to suppose that the emotion displayed by the animal\nis caused by the behaviour or appearance of his human com\npanion when seeing the apparition as to suppose it caused\nby any sharing of the vision. When the action of the animal\nwhich leads to the inference that he is a co-percipient precedes\nthe seeing of the apparition by the human percipient, suggestion\nmay no doubt be exercised by the animal on his companion,\nbut that may be the whole of his share in the phenomenon.\nThe account is contained in a letter from Miss Grieve to\nMr. Lang as follows :\nSKELFHILL, HAWICK, N.B., August 8th, 1906.\n... I have been staying here since August 4th. On Monday,\n6th, I went up the Pen and for the first time in my life saw a\n' ghost ! ' Turk, the old Dandie Diomont, was with me ; and Mrs.\nE., a Swiss lady also staying here, had said she would go too, but\nit was hot, and in the end she stayed at home. Turk and I went\nvery slowly, taking many rests on account of his short legs and\nshorter breath, and the grass and brackens were long and strong.\nOur last stop was where the Pen suddenly takes up for its rocky\ntop very steeply. I sat with my back against the dyke facing\nthe steep part, and Turk lay panting beside me. I was thinking\nof a beautiful decking of grouse we had just disturbed\u2014the two\nparent birds and five young ones clapped about four yards from\nus. Turk did not see them at first and I stood perfectly still\nwatching, they were so pretty. Then Turk winded them and threw\nup his head, and of course with the movement the birds were off\n\fFEB., 1907. Case. 29\nlike a whirlwind. This just to show you my train of thought.\nQuite suddenly I saw coming along at right angles to me, a friend,\nDr. H., who crossed with me May, 1905, from America. She was\nin a rather short dark blue skirt, white cotton blouse, no hat, and\na stick in her hand\u2014and later, I noticed a tail of hair beginning\nto ' come down.' I had heard about fortnight ago that she had\nlanded in England from America and was to sail back Sept. 12,\nand that she was going to her home in Cornwall for part of the\ntime\u2014 but when I did not know. I was so surprised I did not\nsay anything for a second or two till Turk began to growl. Then\nI jumped up exclaiming ' Dr. H. ! ' She looked straight at me,\nbut when I spoke, turned and went on down the hill\u2014following\nher own direction and the one from which I had come. I followed\nquickly to catch her up, feeling rather queer because she did not\nspeak, and 1 Jfnew she had seen me ! Turk barked and growled the\nwhole time, but kept close in to my heels and would not run out\nas he usually does at strange people or strange dogs. His hair\nwas all on end and his tail hooked over his back, as stiff as a\npoker. I almost caught up Dr. H., and was just going to put out\nmy hand to touch her shoulder, when a big bumble bee whirled\nbetween us and flew right through Dr. H. and she disappeared.\nI certainly did feel queer after that\u2014I was so very sure it\nwas she and it was such a shock to find there was nothing. Had\nit not been for Turk I should have doubted my senses; but he\n\u2022was so unmistakably disturbed and angry. I swear I am well\u2014\nnever was better, and have had nothing stronger to drink than\nwater for over a year. The exact moment of the apparition I\ncannot quite give you, but it was 6.5 p.m. when I sat down, and\n6.15 perhaps a minute or even two minutes after it had disappeared.\nI had a pencil and envelope in my pocket and made a rough\nnote of it there on the top of the Pen, and wrote it out in\ndetail when I got down here to the house. Of course I have\nwritten (yesterday) to Dr. H. to know whatever she was doing\nat that date and hour, and will let you know her reply\u2014probably\nbathing at Tintagel ! Yesterday just after I had written to her\ncame a p.c. from her twice forwarded and dated Tintagel, Aug. 1st,\nto say she was having a glorious' holiday there ; but of course that\nwas six days before I saw her. It is interesting, and I sincerely\nhope nothing has happened to her. ...\nMiss Grieve wrote later to Mr. Lang in answer to some\nquestions of his about the incident, and enclosed a rough\nsketch (not reproduced here) to show the positions of herself\n\f30 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1907.\nand the dog at the time, the apparition coming round from\nbehind and passing in front of them :\nSeptember 23rd, 1906.\nI wonder if the enclosed sketch will clear up those points for\nyou. She came along by the top dyke, you see. Turk and I were,\nin reality, round the corner with our backs against the dyke (at\nleast, mine was), only I cannot show that in the diagram. I was\nsitting when I first saw the figure, so also was Turk, though he\ncollected his wits quicker than I, for he barked before I spoke.\nTruly I am certain I was not asleep, though one cannot deny the\npossibility. Dr. H. has since stayed with me here, and should by\nnow have landed in America. She said on that day and hour she\nwas coming down their hill at Tintagel in the clothes I described,\nbut with a wet bathing gown on her arm, which I did not see.\nUnfortunately the letter which Miss Grieve wrote to Dr.\nH. at the time and the latter's reply were not preserved, but\nMiss Grieve afterwards obtained the testimony of Dr. H.'s\nsister about it, as explained in the following letter to Mr.\nLang:\nOctober 28th, 1906.\nI destroyed the letter long ago\u2014it was so long and bulky to\nkeep, but I copied out the simple statement from it (at the time)\nthat Dr. H. on that evening was walking down the hill after\nbathing, dressed in blue skirt, etc. Dr. H. herself never wrote of\nit, but her sister, who was with her at the time, did\u2014M. H., and\nI have sent that copy on for M. H. to sign. She is ill and\nin hospital, but I think she will be well enough to sign, though\nprobably not to write a letter.\nThe following is the corroboration given by Miss M. H. :\nAbout 6 p.m. on Aug. 6th, 1906, Dr. H. was walking down a\nhill near Tintagel after bathing. She wore a dark blue skirt, 110\nhat, and over her arm a wet bathing dress.\nQuite correct.\n(Signed in full) M. H.\nTHE AEENSBUEG POLTEEGEIST.\nA FEW years ago, in the course of a correspondence in the\nJournal between Dr. A. E. Wallace and Mr. F. Podmore on\nClairvoyance and Poltergeists, Dr. Wallace referred (in the\nJournal for February, 1899, Vol. IX., p. 28) to the disturb\n\fFEB., 1907. The Arensburg Poltergeist. 31\nances in the cemetery at Arensburg as a specially noteworthy\ncase. These were described by E. Dale Owen in his Footfalls\non the Boundary of Another World, pp. 186-193. Arensburg\nis a town in the island of Oesel, which is situated in the\nBaltic Sea, and forms part of the province of Livonia. In\nthe public cemetery of Arensburg in 1844, coffins were said to\nhave been found disarranged in the vault under the private\nchapel belonging to the family of Buxhoewden. An official\nenquiry was made by the Baron de Guldenstubbe , President of\nthe Consistory, the Bishop of the province, and other members\nof the Consistory, a physician of repute, and representatives\nof the municipal authorities.\nIt is stated that after the most careful precautions had been\ntaken to exclude ordinary human agency (as detailed in\nOwen's account and summarised by Dr. Wallace), the coffins\nwere found to have been disturbed again. An official report\nof all the occurrences was drawn up, signed by all the members\nof the commission of enquiry, and placed on record with the\nother proceedings of the Consistory, where it \" is to be found\namong its archives and may be examined by any travellers,\nrespectably recommended, on application to its secretary\"\n(Owen, Footfalls, p. 192). Owen states that he had not him\nself seen this document, but was informed of all the facts\nin 1859 by the daughter and son of the Baron de Guldenstubbe.\nOwen's own account, therefore, as Mr. Podmore pointed out\n(Journal for June, 1899, Vol. IX., p. 93), is at third-hand,\nand neither he nor his informants professed to have seen the\nofficial documents on which the evidence for the case rests.\nOn the subject of these documents Mr. Solovovo writes to\nMr. Podmore on Oct. 21 (Nov. 4), 1906 :\n20 SERGIEESKAIA, ST. PETERSBURG.\nWith reference to the conversation I had with you in Mr. Leafs\nhouse about a fortnight or three weeks ago on the \"Arensburg\ndisturbances\" of 1844, described by R. Dale Owen in Footfalls on the\nBoundary of Another World, p. 186, and referred to by Dr. A. R. Wallace\nin the S.P.R. Journal, February 1899, p. 28, I now send you\nthe following statement : That, my attention having been called to\nthis incident, I applied at the time (on Feb. 4\/16, 1899) to the\n\" Livlandisches Evangelisches-Lutherisches Consistorium \" at Riga,\nand received on Feb. 19 (March 4) an official answer to the effect\nthat they had in their archives (or, to be quite accurate, in the archives\n\f32 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1907.\n\"des ehemaligen Oeselschen E.-L. Consistoriums \") no documents\nbearing on the subject : also referring me to the archives of St.\nLaurentius's Church at Arensburg. I therefore wrote to Arensburg\nand received a letter from the Rev. Lemm, \" Ober-pastor \" of the\nchurch in question, which was wholly negative. Mr. Lemm also\nmentioned that some years before the present Baron Buxhoewden,\nto whose family the burial vault in question belongs, had communicated\nwith him on the subject, having read about the \"disturbances\" in\nsome Warsaw newspaper; but had in spite of his enquiries failed\nto find anything either at Arensburg, or at Riga. . . .\nMICHAEL PETROVO-SOLOVOVO.\nP.S.\u2014I have the two above-mentioned letters before me as I\nwrite.\nABEIDGED EDITION OF \"HUMAN PEESONALITY.\"\nAN abridgment of Mr. Myers's Human Personality, edited by\nhis son, Mr. L. H. Myers, has just been published by Messrs.\nLongmans, Green, & Co. in a single 8vo. volume of 470 pages,\nprice 10s. 6d. net. As explained in a prefatory note by the\neditor, Mr. Myers himself had indicated briefly the lines on\nwhich an abridgment could best be made, and the work has\nbeen carried out in as close accordance as possible with those\nindications.\nAbout half of each volume in the original edition consisted\nof Appendices containing examples of the various kinds of\nphenomena discussed and analysed in the text. These have\nbeen considerably reduced in number without, probably,\ndetracting much from the value of the work for the ordinary\nreader ; but all the cases retained in the new edition are\nquoted in full, since an abridged version has very little value.\nThe editor observes that the statement made by Mr. Myers\nin his preface, that \" the book is an exposition rather than\na proof,\" naturally applies with even greater force to the\nabridgment. The cases given in it are to be regarded simply\nas illustrative of the main types of evidence on which the\nargument rests. But for the most important parts of the\nevidence itself the serious reader will be able to consult the\noriginal authorities by the help of the very complete references\nwhich are given throughout and which form a valuable feature\nof the work.\n\fNo. CCXXXVII.\u2014VOL.

B. Florence at the Annual Meeting of\nMembers of the Society on January 30th suggests that, in\nspite of the very complete discussion and expositions of the\nsubject in the early volumes of the Proceedings and Journal,\na certain amount of misapprehension still exists in the minds\nof some members of the Society as to the meaning to be\nattached to the word. It may therefore be worth while to\nrefer again to Mr. Gurney's article on the subject in Proceed\nings, Vol. III., pp. 151-189 (reprinted in Chapter X. of\nVol. I. of Phantasms of the Living). He there remarks (op.\ncit., p. 152) : \" Is it possible to treat hallucinations as a single\nclass of phenomena, marked out by definite characteristics?\nThe popular answer would no doubt be : Yes, that the\ndistinguishing characteristic is some sort of false belief. But\nthis is an error : in many of the best known cases of\nhallucination\u2014that of Nicolai, for instance\u2014the percipient\nhas held with respect to the figures that he saw or the voices\nthat he heard, not a false but a true belief, to wit, that they\ndid not correspond to any external reality. The only sort of\nhallucination which is necessarily characterised by false belief\nis the purely non-sensory sort\u2014as where a person has a fixed\nidea that every one is plotting against him, or that he is\nbeing secretly mesmerised from a distance. Of hallucinations\nof the senses, belief in their reality, though a frequent, is by\nno means an essential feature ; a tendency to deceive is all\nthat we can safely predicate of them.\" \" I should consider\n[the] distinctive characteristic [of phantoms] to be some\nthing quite apart from the question whether or not they\nwere actually mistaken for real figures,\u2014namely, their marked\nresemblance to real figures and the consequent necessity for\nthe exercise of memory and reflection to prevent so mistaking\nthem. The definition of a sensory hallucination would thus\nbe a percept which lacks, but which can only by distinct\nreflection be recognised as lacking, the objective basis which\nit suggests,\u2014where objective basis is to be taken as a short\n\fMAR., 1907. On the Use of the Term \" Hallucination.\" 35\nway of naming the possibility of being shared by all persons\nwith normal senses \" (op. cit., p. 154).\nIt is to be observed that this definition includes \" veridical \"\nhallucinations as well as those which there is no reason to\nregard as anything but purely subjective. Veridical hallucina\ntions, e.g., of human figures, may be due to a telepathic\nimpulse, or to some other unknown influence, but the\nparticular objective basis which they suggest,\u2014namely, that\nof a material figure within the field of vision of the percipient,\n\u2014is lacking ; they are therefore hallucinatory. The term\nused to express them is merely descriptive of their psycho\nlogical nature ; it does not either assert or deny that they may\nor do originate in some agency external to the mind of the\npercipient.\nApart from this, it is important to note that the word\n\" hallucination,\" both in medicine l and in psychology, is now\nrestricted to hallucinations of a sensory kind, whereas in\nordinary usage it sometimes includes as well those non-sensory\nhallucinations or delusions which, as Gurney says, are always\n\" characterised by false belief,\" and which give the word its\nobjectionable connotation. Thus, in the discussion in his\nPrinciples of Psychology, Vol. II., pp. 114 et seq., Professor\nJames says : \" Illusions and hallucinations must both be\ndistinguished from delusions. A delusion is a false opinion\nabout a matter of fact, which need not necessarily involve,\nthough it often does involve, false perceptions of sensible\nthings\" (op. cit., p. 114 foot-note). \"Where a hallucination\nis complete, it is much more than a mental image. A\nhallucination is a strictly sensational form of consciousness,\nas good and true a sensation as if there were a real object\nthere. The object happens not to be there, that is all\"\n(p. 115).\nCASE.\nM. Aut. 104.\nTHE following case, in which information of a death that had\noccurred about 17 or 18 hours previously was given by means\n1 See, e.g., Hack Tuke's Dictionary of Psychological Medicine.\n\f36 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., 1907.\nof table-tilting, is contributed by Miss Helen Verrall, who\nwrites :\u2014\n5 SELWYN GARDENS, CAMBRIDGE,\nFebruary 5th, 1907.\nOn Tuesday, January 29th, 1907, at 6 p.m., Mr. Bayfield and I\nendeavoured to obtain automatic \" messages \" by means of table-\ntilting, as we have done on several previous occasions. Since there\nwas no other person in the room, we were compelled to record the\nmessages ourselves, and consequently to follow them word by word ;\nwe were not, however, able for the most part to form any expectation\nof what the next word was likely to be, and our expectations, when\nwe did form any, proved as often as not incorrect. It is evident,\ntherefore, that the general tenour of the messages can have been\nlittle affected by our conscious thoughts. The following statement\nwas obtained ; the questions asked by us are in brackets.\nFellow of Royal Society. (What was his name1!) Potter. (What\nabout him?) Died this afternoon. (What time?) ^.SO. (Can you\ntell us more about him?) Edditor (sic) of Physiological Review.\n(Where did he live?) London. (What address?) 43 Belsize\nGardens, Kensington. (Was he married ? ) Yes. (Had he any\nchildren ? ) Yes, five.\nAt the time this message conveyed nothing either to Mr. Bayfield\nand me or to my father, Dr. Verrall, to whom it was shown on\nTuesday evening; we considered it indeed of so little value that\nwe discouraged any further communications on the subject, and\ntried to direct the phenomena into what we considered more\n\" evidential \" channels.\nWe thought no more of the matter until we heard on Wednesday\nafternoon of the death of Sir Michael Foster, which took place, as\nwe learnt by subsequent enquiry, early in the morning of Tuesday,\nJanuary 29th. It was not, however, publicly announced until\nWednesday, and on Tuesday was known in Cambridge only to a\nvery small number of people, apparently four. That the news did\nnot spread is clearly shown by the fact that it did not appear in\nany paper until Wednesday afternoon. The names of those who\nare known to have received the news on Tuesday have been told to\nus, and it appears certain that neither Mr. Bayfield nor I can have\ncome into any sort of contact with them in the course of that day.\nIf that be so, the \" message \" obtained by us, unless it is to be\nregarded as a mere coincidence, must have been obtained by some\nother than the normally recognised means of communication.\n\fMAB., 1907. Case. 37\nWith regard to the question of coincidence, it may be noted that\n\u2014setting aside for the moment details given in reply to leading\nquestions, which will be considered later\u2014our message can be stated\nthus : A Fellow of the Royal Society (a), by name Potter (b) , and\nEditor of the Physiological Review (c), has died this afternoon (d).\nOf these statements, as applied to Sir Michael Foster, (a) is correct ;\n(c) is also correct, except for the discrepancy between Review and\nJournal. \" Sir M. Foster founded and edited the Journal of Physiology.\"\n(See obituary notice in the Times of Jan. 31.) (b) is not correct,\nbut there is a close resemblance between the two names, four out\nof the whole six letters being right and in the right place. The\ndescription (c) is distinctive ; there are only two people to whom\nit could up to the present ever have been applied, Sir M. Foster\nand the present editor, Professor J. N. Langley, whose name, it\nwill be seen, does not bear the least resemblance to \"Potter.\"\n(a), (5), and (c) combined would appear therefore to point to one\nman only, Sir M. Foster, who is stated to have died on Tuesday\nafternoon (d), and died as a fact on Tuesday morning.\nThe further details given, such as the hour and place of death,\nare almost all incorrect, but it should be noticed that they were\ngiven in reply to leading questions, and it is my impression, based\non previous experience, that in the case of automatic messages\nstatements so obtained are seldom trustworthy. For instance, 43\nBelsize Road, Hampstead, is, as I afterwards remembered, an address\nwith which I was once familiar ; the address given in the message\nof January 29th is evidently a variation on this. On the other\nhand, the three statements numbered above (a), (c), (d), were given\neither spontaneously or in answer to questions so vague as to\nafford practically no guidance or restriction to the answers, (b)\u2014a\npartially correct answer\u2014was, I think, given in reply to a definite\nquestion ; but on this point Mr. Bayfield's recollections differ from\nmine; he thinks that the first question asked was \"What about\nhim 1 \"\nMr. Bayfield and I have sat for automatic phenomena of this\nkind on 17 occasions. This is the only time that we have produced\na statement that some one had recently died.\nHELEN DK G. VERRALL.\nMiss Verrall and Mr. Bayfield give the following statements\nas to what they were doing during the earlier part of the\nday when the message was received, showing that they had\nhad no opportunity of hearing the news by normal means.\n\f38 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., 1907.\nFebruary 2nd, 1907.\nOn January 29th I did not leave the house, except for a short\ntime in the afternoon, when I bicycled to a shop to pay a bill. I\nmet no one that I knew and spoke to no one but the shopwoman.\nOn my way home I went to see Miss Hudson at Newnham College.\nThe news of Sir M. Foster's death was not known in Newnham at\nthat time. I spoke to no one but Miss Hudson.\nH. DE G. VERRALL.\nTHE RECTORY, HERTINGFORDBURY,\nHERTFORD, February ith, 1907.\nOn Monday, January 28th of this year, I arrived at Dr. Verrall's\nhouse, 5 Selwyn Gardens, Cambridge. On the next day\u2014the day\non which Miss Verrall and I received the \" message \" through the\ntable\u2014I did not leave the house except for a short bicycle ride\nwith Dr. Verrall from about noon to 1.15. During the ride I spoke\nto no one but Dr. Verrall and his man-servant who draws his trailer.\nIf any strangers came to the house on that day I did not see\nthem, and spoke to no one but members of Dr. Verrall's family and\nthe man-servant mentioned above.\nDuring my visit no mention was made of Sir Michael Foster\nuntil the middle of Wednesday afternoon, the 30th, when Dr.\nVerrall received a letter announcing Sir Michael's death.\nM. A. BAYFIELD.\nThe note made at the time, the original of which is in\nour possession, reads thus :\u2014\n\" 6 p.m. Jan. 29, '07.\n\" Fellow of Boyal Society Potter died this afternoon 4.30\n\u2014Edditor of Physiological Review\u2014London\u201443 Belsize Gar\ndens, Kensington.

Case. 39\nIn answer to questions, Miss Verrall gives a translation\nof the Latin and some further information as follows :\u2014\n(1) Translation of Latin.\nWhen the emperor (or general) demanded the garden of Quintus\nFlavins for his own use, the latter replied, \" You are leaving your\nown (garden ?), but in great affairs (or possibly people) what matters\nsilence of the voice t \" The emperor [replied], \" You ask for silence.\nYou shall have it,\" and he shut him up in prison.\n(2) The paper of original notes gives everything that was tilted\nby the table ; our own questions were written out next day from\nmemory. The recollections of Mr. Bayfield and myself did not differ\nexcept on the one point I mentioned in my account. The words\nin brackets were not tilted by the table, but said by us.\n(3) Time of death.\nThe Times obituary notice, January 31st, says : \" The death of\nSir Michael Foster . . . occurred suddenly on Tuesday night in\nLondon.\"\nThe Times, February 1st, death column, gives : \" On the morning of\nJanuary 29th in London suddenly, Sir Michael Foster. . . .\"\nThe University Reporter says that Sir Michael Foster died on Mon\nday night (January 28th).\nThere is no doubt that Sir Michael Foster died during the\nnight of Monday, January 28th ; whether before or after\nmidnight has not been clearly ascertained. He was taken ill\nvery suddenly, having attended and spoken (as stated in the\nTimes of January 29th) at the annual meeting of the British\nScience Guild which was held at the Mansion House on\nMonday afternoon, and nothing was heard of his illness in\nCambridge until after his death. In the course of Tuesday\nthe fact of his death was communicated to a very small\nnumber of persons at Cambridge, apparently four, none of\nwhom came into contact on that day with either Miss Verrall\nor Mr. Bayfield. The first public announcement in Cambridge\nseems to have been a telegram to the Union on Wednesday\nmorning, and the London evening papers of Wednesday were\nthe first to contain the news.\nThere are various points of interest in this case. It is to\nbe noted that the \" message \" is received by persons who\nhave no special personal interest in it, beyond that of any\none connected with the University in which Sir Michael\n\f40 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., 1907.\nFoster had for some 35 years played so prominent a part.\nThe slight inaccuracies of the statements made of course detract\nsomewhat from their evidential value ; yet the identification of\nthe person referred to is unmistakable. As Miss Verrall points\nout, the most inaccurate statements are those given in answer\nto questions. This we believe to be frequently the case ; it\nseems to be rarely, if ever, that information directly asked for\nis obtained through automatic messages. It is impossible to ask\nquestions without forming some kind of expectation or guess as\nto what the answer may be, and this probably brings into play\nthe normal consciousness of the automatist, and so affects the\nresults. Self-suggestion in such a case may act so as to\nproduce a statement in accordance with the conscious expec\ntation ; or it may equally well inhibit the conscious expectation\nand produce a contrary statement. The fact of a statement\nbeing unexpected thus by no means proves that it is not of\nsubjective origin.\nThe somewhat fantastic Latin sentences that follow the\nstatements about the death do not seem to have any con\nnection with them, and may, of course, have an entirely\ndifferent origin. They are quoted here merely in order that\nthe case may be presented as completely as possible.\nLUMINOUS APPEARANCES IN CONNECTION WITH\nTHE WELSH REVIVAL.\nMR. FRYER'S paper on \" Psychological Aspects of the Welsh\nRevival \" in Proceedings S.P.R., Part LI., gives several instances\nof mysterious lights seen in connection with it, and a further\ncase was given in the Journal for December, 1906. Mr. Fryer\nnow sends us the following note on two other alleged cases :\nAt the end of March, 1906, the newspapers announced that lights\nhad been seen in connection with Mrs. Jones's mission at Tregaron,\nin Cardiganshire. One account has it that as \"half-a-dozen men\nwere returning from a prayer-meeting they looked back and saw\na ball of light coming towards them from the direction of Berth.\nAfter proceeding for some distance it divided into two, and, as\nsome say, into three halls. These proceeded towards them, forming\nlittle circles in the air as they approached, and in a short time\n\fMAB., 1907. Luminous Appearances in Welsh Revival. 41\nthey united, and then, in the form of a star encircled in light,\ncame towards the people. Afterwards it went back in the direction\nof Berth Chapel.\" Mr. LI. T. Jones, B.Sc., a schoolmaster in the\nneighbourhood, made an investigation into the subject, and in the\nWestern Mail of April 5th, 1906, published his conclusions. He\nfound that the lights were partly due to reflections from a fire\nof refuse, and in part to furze burning. His experiments included\na repetition of the furze-burning by the farm servant who was at the\nwork on the night when the excited revivalists saw the lights first.\nHis report is too long for insertion here, but it leaves us in no\ndoubt as to the purely mundane nature of the lights at Tregaron.\nIn February, 1906, lights were seen at and near the Galvinistic\nChapel at Cwmgeiad, near Ystradgynlais, by the chapel keeper,\nMrs. Powell, and also by the minister of the chapel, the Rev. W.\nGriffiths. After having received answers to questions sent to Mrs.\nPowell I visited the scene of the alleged occurrences on April 19th\nand interviewed Mrs. Powell and the minister, Mr. Griffiths.\nBoth gave me accounts of what they had seen, and pointed out\nthe places where the lights had been seen. The former saw the\nlights stretching out in rays from her back door (the house adjoins\nthe chapel) over the garden trees. The latter saw a star-like\nappearance in the heavens, not near the chapel, but from the back\nof his house a quarter of a mile away. The chief light appeared\nto travel from out of one valley towards the east, across the hills\nto the west, and to the valley in which the chapel stands. The\ndistance apparently travelled must have been more than a mile.\nMr. Griffiths also saw lights when driving with Mrs. Jones to\nSeven Sisters for a service, and again he says he saw a light at\nthe chapel at Ystalyfera, not very far from Ystradgynlais. Mrs.\nJones was at the chapel house when the lights were seen by Mrs.\nPowell, and the latter says that she asked Mrs. Jones whether\nsuch a vision would be granted to her. As the hour was late\n(2 a.m.) and there had been much conversation about the subject,\nit is perhaps not surprising that the wish was gratified.\nI have made repeated endeavours to obtain from Mr. Griffiths\na written account of what he saw, and have furnished him with\na map of the district, on which I asked that the course of the light\nmight be marked. I also sent him copies of the photographs taken\nof the various places where the lights are said to have been seen,\nbut I can get no answer, and all that can be concluded is that,\naccording to the spoken testimony, something was seen, but what\n\f42 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., 1907.\nmust remain undecided. Mr. Griffiths is not the only person who\nis willing to talk at any length about the \"supernatural,\" but is\nunwilling to put his evidence on paper.\nCOEBESPONDENCE.\nI.\nON Miss JOHNSON'S RECENT SITTINGS FOR PHYSICAL PHENOMENA\nIN AMERICA.\nU.S.A., 26\/A January, 1907.\nI HAVE read with the greatest interest the synopsis of Miss Alice\nJohnson's paper on \"Some Recent Sittings for Physical Phenomena\nin America,\" printed in the January Journal of the S.P.R.\nSpeaking generally, I fear that Miss Johnson's hypothesis perplexes\nme almost as much as do the phenomena themselves. As I have the\ngreatest respect for her opinion and for her great abilities as an\ninvestigator, I have tried hard to reconcile Miss Johnson's views\nwith my own observations, but up to the present time with only\npartial success. After stretching her conclusions to their limit, they\ncould only be available in the case of some of the occurrences,\nwhilst in the more remarkable phenomena they seem to me to be\nalmost inadmissible.\nTake for instance the moving of various objects on the top of the\ntable when apparently no one was touching the table, such as the\nrolling backwards and forwards of a lead pencil, the agitation of\nvarious liquids in transparent glass bottles. I cannot see how any\nautomatic action could produce such phenomena without being\ninstantly detected.\nThen again\u2014What about the levitation ? We all saw the table\nrise from the ground, or thought we did, and three of us who had\nour hands upon it felt the upward movement also, or thought we\ndid. I have seen the table perform the same act before, and once\nwithout apparent contact.\nMiss Johnson and I tried afterwards various methods of produc\ning the same phenomenon fraudulently with our feet, but our efforts\nwere so ridiculously obvious that it was hard to suppose they could\nhave remained unnoticed by any one in the room. Moreover, when\nthe levitation in question occurred, Mrs. Williams' son, a bright\n\fMAE., 1907. Correspondence. 43\nand intelligent lad of 15, declared that he could see under the\ntable and that nobody's foot was there,\n\"Tis STRANGE 'tis pity, and pity 'tis 'tis STRANGE.\"\nIt is a matter which we all regret that Miss Johnson did not\nwitness some of the most remarkable things\u2014which however happen\nonly occasionally. Of course this could not be helped. It was\nunfortunate that several members of the best circle we have here\nwere away when Miss Johnson came. However, as she says, she\nsaw a fair average of the sittings.\nFrom the many long and most interesting and instructive talks\nI have had with Miss Johnson on things psychic, I have learned\nmuch and find myself generally in full accord with her views; but\nthe pill composed of automatic raps, taps, table tilts, table move\nments with and without apparent contact, which she has given me\nis, I find, difficult to swallow, and in the present impoverished\ncondition of my psychic digestion I must be allowed a little time\nfor its assimilation.\nSir Oliver Lodge has struck a new key (to me at least) which\nseems to excite my psychic tympanum into sympathetic response.\nHe says\u2014\"the occurrences sometimes were such as to suggest a\nsort of nervous explosion or stimulus giving rise to muscular actions\nin the body at the same time that it affected objects at a little\ndistance from the body.\" I am glad to note that Miss Johnson\nagrees with Sir Oliver in this, and so I intend trying a dose of it\nimmediately, and whilst of course I cannot tell just what the result\n\u2022will be, yet I will carefully observe the symptoms and report upon\nthem later on, if I may.\nAs psychical phenomena appear just now to be \"in the air,\"\u2014\nor, as Miss Johnson would say, \"a wide-spread epidemic of rapping\"\nis now raging,\u2014would it not be well for members of the S.P.R. to\nform circles, when and where convenient, for the purpose of ex\nperiment 1 It seems probable that some systematic and regular\nexperiments, carefully recorded, would throw much light upon these\ninteresting but obscure phenomena.\nJOHN H. GOWER.\nFebruary 20th, 1906.\nIn the paper which I read before the Society last December I\nwas only able to give a brief account of what had occurred before\nmy visit to America, since most of the limited time at my command\nhad to be spent in describing and discussing my own experiences.\n\f44- Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., 1907.\nThis may, I am afraid, have given a somewhat disproportionate\nview of the whole series of the phenomena, and the disproportion\nhas been still further emphasised by the brevity of the report in\nthe Journal, to which my friend Dr. Gower alludes. I did, however,\nstate in my paper (and this is repeated in the Journal report) that\nwhile the raps could, I thought, be explained as due to the uncon\nscious automatic muscular action of the sitters, it was obviously far\nmore difficult\u2014though perhaps not quite impossible\u2014to apply the\nexplanation of automatism to the levitations of the table which I\nhad witnessed, \"and it seemed altogether inapplicable to the more\ndecisive movements without contact that were reported by the other\nwitnesses to have occurred at the earlier sittings.\"\nIn the full report, which will, I hope, appear in the next Part of\nthe Proceedings, I propose to give verbatim the records of these earlier\nsittings, so that readers may have before them all the material avail\nable for forming a judgment on the case. I need hardly add that\nI fully recognise the great weight that should be attached to Dr.\nGrower's opinion, since he is not only an experienced investigator,\nbut was present himself at the whole series of sittings, and conse\nquently has had a far better opportunity than I have had of coming\nto a definite conclusion about them.\nALICE JOHNSON.\nII.\nON EXPERIMENTS WITH THE STHENOMETER.\n[Dr. P. Joire, whose experiments with the sthenometer were\ncriticised by Mr. Stratton and Mr. Phillips in the Journal for\nlast December, asks us to insert the following reply from him,\nwhich appeared originally in the Annales des Sciences Psychiques\nfor the same month. We add a brief rejoinder from Mr.\nStratton.\u2014ED.]\nCertains experimentateurs ont sembl6 s'efforcer de demontrer que\nla chaleur peut avoir une action sur un corps leger et en particulier\nsur 1'aiguille du sthenometre.\nCette demonstration etait parfaitement inutile, car nous savons\ndepuis longtemps que la chaleur peut determiner des courants dans\n1'air et d6placer, par consequent, les corps qui s'y trouvent.\nQuiconque veut se donner la peine de lire ce que j'ai 6crit\ndans les Annales de juillet-aout 1904, p. 250, verra que je ne nie\npas \"que les forces susdites (la chaleur) puisserit, dans certaines\n\fMAB., 1907. Correspondence. 45\nconditions, produire une action analogue ; mais j'ai dit que, dans les\nconditions oil je me suis placd, elles ne s'enoncent pas ; et que, dans\nles experiences telles que je les ai indiqutes, une autre force entre en\njeu.\" Je renvoie maintenant le lecteur aux experiences par lesquelles\nj'ai eiimine la chaleur, p. 248. J'ajoute une autre experience faite\ndepuis : j'ai porte Pair interieur de la cloche a une temperature de\n45\u00b0 C. Dans ces conditions, la main mettait encore 1'aiguille en\nmouvement. Pense-t-on que la chaleur de la main ait pu ajouter\n\u2022quelque chose a une temperature de 45\u00b0?\nJe citerai encore une autre experience faite par un autre expert-\nmentateur, M. Jounet, et publiee dans I'Echo du Merveilleux, 1OT\noctobre 1905, p. 380.\nLe sthenometre, dit M. Jounet, etant installe sur un support\nparfaitement stable, je posai doucement la bouillotte a c6te du sthe-\nnometre, le flauc de la bouillotte en face de la pointe de 1'aiguille.\nL'aiguille etait immobile sur un degre dont je notai le numero.\nJe m'eioignai au fond de la piece et comptai sur ma montre cinq\nminutes. Au retour, je constatai que 1'aiguille avait 6t6 attiree de\n21\u00b0. Le doute ne me paraissait plus possible. La chaleur de 1'eau\ntransmise par le metal agissait certainement sur le sthenometre.\nPourtant, la main placee en face de 1'aiguille immobile, pendant\n<sinq minutes, egalement 1'attira de 38\".\nOr, la chaleur de la bouillotte a Pexterieur, mesuree avec un ther-\nmometre exact, etait de 40'8\u00b0.\nLa chaleur de la main, mesuree avec le me'tne thermometre et\npendant le mSme temps (3 minutes) que celle de la bouillotte, etait\nde 35\u00b0 et demi.\nDone la bouillotte, avec une chaleur plus forte, avait eu une\naction moindre ; la main, avec une chaleur moindre, une action plus\nforte.\nL'experience de M. Jounet, que je viens de citer textuellement,\nest bien concluante.\nLa chaleur peut agir sur 1'aiguille du sthenometre ; je n'ai jamais\ndit le contraire.\nMais si une bouillotte attire 1'aiguille de 21\u00b0 d'une temperature\n\u2022de 40'8\u00b0, si, d'autre part, la main, d'une temperature de 35'5\u00b0 attire\n1'aiguille de 38\u00b0, on ne niera pas, je suppose, qu'il y a, dans 1'epreuve\nde la main, une force autre que celle de la chaleur. C'est ce qu'il\nfallait demontrer.\nAu surplus, qu'on se donne la peine de lire dans le me\"me article\nde M. Jounet, m^me numero de I'Echo du Merveilkux, les experiences\n\f46 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., 1907.\nqu'il a faites avec un animal a sang froid, une grenouille. En ce\nqui concerne mon sthenometre, M. Jounet dit :\n\"Le c6t6 gauche de la grenouille, place aupres du sthenometre\nJoire, pendant 17 minutes, exerca une repulsion de 30\u00b0.\"\nEst-ce encore la chaleur qui agit dans ce cas ?\nEt dans les experiences plus recentes que j'ai publiees sur 1'em-\nmagasinement de la force dans diffeients corps, est-ce aussi la\nchaleur qui produit la deviation de 1'aiguille?\nEn resume, de nombreuses experiences faites par differents ex-\nperimentateurs ont demontre qu'une force, autre que la chaleur,\nemanant du corps humain agit sur Paiguille du sthenometre.\nD* P. JOIRE.\nLILLK, 16 novemhre 1906.\nDr. Joire repeats the statement made in his first paper that heat\ncan produce the motion observed in the sthenometer, but he claims\nthat in the conditions under which he has experimented, heat is not\nthe agent. In reply to this I can only say that this statement can\nhold good simply for the one experiment he records in which he\nstrove to eliminate the effect of heat by using a screen of cotton\nwool. In experiments conducted with the hand according to the\ninstructions given in the circular accompanying the instrument when\nbought (and in the way suggested by Dr. Joire in his papers), heat\nradiated from the hand is present in sufficient amount to account\nfor the motion observed, and to mask completely any other force\nwhich might or might not be present. This is easily proved by\nholding the hand in cold water for some minutes before experi\nmenting, when the effect may be made to vanish ; or by heating it\nin front of a fire, when the effect will increase.\nI repeat that heat being known to produce the effect observed,\ncare must be taken in all experiments designed to prove the exist\nence of a \" new force \" to screen the sthenometer carefully from heat\nrays. Whenever this has been done, so far as I have been able to\nobserve, the motion of the needle has vanished. Dr. Joire does not\ngive sufficient details of his one experiment along these lines to\nenable it to be repeated exactly, while his other experiments, in so\nfar as they have any bearing on the question, support my hypothesis.\nP. J. M. STRATTON.\nDR. TUCKEY'S \"HYPNOTISM.\"\nTHE fifth edition of Dr. C. Lloyd Tuckey's well-known work\non Treatment by Hypnotism and Suggestion is just about to\nappear, with an introductory chapter by Sir Francis Cruise,\n\fMar., 1907. Dr. Tuckey's \" Hypnotism,.\" 47\nM.D., Physician to the King in Ireland. The first edition,\nunder the title of Psycho-Therapeutics, was published in 1889,\nthe second in 1890, the third in 1891, and the fourth in\n1900. In each case the book was thoroughly revised and\nconsiderably enlarged, the first edition consisting only of 80 pp.,\nwhile the fourth amounts to 372 pp. The present edition\nagain contains a good deal of additional matter, partly drawn\nfrom the latest edition of Professor Forel's Hypnotism, of which\nDr. Tuckey speaks in his Preface with special admiration, and\npartly from his own recent practical experience, as well as\nthat of other English and foreign workers in the same field.\nThere is also a very full and comprehensive Index.\n\" England (says Dr. Tuckey) still continues much behind\nother countries in taking up [hypnotic] treatment ; but there\nis much less prejudice against it than formerly, especially\namong medical men. Perhaps the decrease in the amount of\nacute and gross disease and the increase of functional and\nnervous disorders have something to do with this changed\nattitude. The growth of fantastic systems of ' mind-cure ' is\na real danger to scientific medicine, as well as to the public,\nand the study of psycho-therapeutics will do more than any\nthing else to help us to understand and combat these forms\nof quackery. They flourish because so many medical men in\nthe past have ignored the psychical factor in disease, and the\npublic therefore have been constrained to seek advice outside\nthe profession.\" He adds that the formation of an English\nsociety of medical men interested in the theory and practice\nof suggestive therapeutics 1 will afford the encouragement and\nsupport so much needed by isolated practitioners, and will\nbring to light much excellent material which is being lost for\nwant of collection.\nTo all these ends Dr. Tuckey's own advocacy of the subject,\nand not least his interesting and instructive book, have greatly\ncontributed, and our readers will no doubt be glad to know of\nthe new edition. It is published by Messrs. Bailliere, Tindall\n& Cox, 8 Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, London, at the\nprice of 10s. 6d. net.\n1 The Medical Society for the Study of Suggestive Therapeutics, of which\nDr. Tnckey himself ia President.

MAR., 1907.\nINTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF PSYCHIATRY.\nAN International Congress of Psychiatry, Neurology, Psychology,\nand the Care of the Insane is to be held at Amsterdam on\nSeptember 2nd-7th, 1907. In the preliminary programme,\nwhich has just been sent to us, it is stated that the Congress\nwas first determined on at a meeting of the Netherlands\nSociety of Psychiatry and Neurology on July 24th, 1903,\nwhen it was pointed out that the important position which\nthe study of nervous and mental diseases now holds in the\nsphere of medical science, and the great social interests involved\nin a sound knowledge of psychological phenomena, make it\nimperative to have recourse from time to time to a wider\nand at the same time more specialised field of discussion than\ncan be provided by a general medical congress.\nIn the organisation of the proposed Congress the schemes of\nthose already held at Brussels and Paris have been followed,\nwith the addition of a special section for psychology and\npsychophysics.\nThe General Committee contains the names of a large\nnumber of medical men who in various towns and districts\nof the Netherlands are engaged in the special departments of\nmedicine to be dealt with by the Congress ; while the Inter\nnational Committee consists of distinguished representatives of\nthe same science from other countries. Great Britain and\nIreland are represented in this preliminary list by Dr. W.\nIreland, of Musselburgh ; Dr. J. H. Macdonald, of Glasgow ;\nDrs. J. Macpherson and W. Ford Robertson, of Edinburgh ;\nDr. Hamilton C. Marr, of Lenzie ; Dr. A. R. Urquhart, of\nPerth ; and Dr. Conolly Norman, of Dublin.\nPersons who take an interest in Psychiatry, Neurology,\nPsychology, and the care of the insane are invited to become\nmembers of the Congress, the subscription to which is 16s. 8d.\nThe languages used will be English, French, and German.\nAny person who wishes to read a paper at the Congress is\nasked to send a synopsis of it to the Secretary before\nMay 1st.

F. BARRETT, F.R.S. The paper is not summarised here,\nas it is intended to be printed in full later.\nSIR OLIVER LODGE said he thought it very important that\nexperiments of this kind should be tried in order to find out\nsomething about the conditions and processes involved. For\ninstance, nothing was known as to whether distance affected\nthe results. A few cases were on record where people had\nsupernormal knowledge of the contents of letters after they\nhad reached the house but before they had been opened, and\nthis suggested that proximity was favourable. But in many\nother cases, as in the experiments just described, distance\nseemed no obstacle, and the supposed favourable effect of\nproximity might be due merely to suggestion or to its being\neasier to direct one's attention to a person in the same room.\nSo far there was no evidence that physical conditions had\n\fAPRIL, 1907. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 51\nany effect one way or the other ; still, as soon as we got to\nthe point of being able to control the results at all, it would\nbe worth while to try definite experiments as to whether\nmaterial obstacles, such as distance or the interposition of\ndifferent substances, interfered. Whether telepathy were purely\nmental or not, it was a phenomenon of transcendent importance,\nmuch more so than was at all generally realised. It has been\nvariously regarded as the vanishing trace of a faculty once\nuniversal, or as the rudiment of a power only now beginning\nto develop. It may further be the universal means of com\nmunication beyond the world of matter. It is the root\ndiscovery of our Society. Many sporadic instances had, of\ncourse, been recorded in earlier days, but they had never been\ncollected and classified under one unifying category, and con\nsequently had been little understood. Telepathy may not be\nthe one and only explanation of supernormal phenomena, as\nMr. Podmore in especial has tried to maintain ; but since the\ngreat majority of such phenomena are at least capable of this\ninterpretation, it is well worth while to consider carefully\nhow far all may be due to it, provided that we do not reject\nwell-evidenced facts only because they cannot be thus explained.\nPROFESSOR BARRETT, in answer to various questions about\nthe paper read, observed that there was no close correspond\nence of time between the impressions of the agent and the\npercipient; the latter often obtaining glimpses of what had\nbeen in the former's mind a few hours previously. It was\nalso noteworthy that some of the most successful results were\nobtained when the agent was not consciously and deliberately\ntrying to impress the percipient at all. As in so many other\npsychical regions, the faculties exercised seemed to be those\nof the subliminal self, and not in any way under the control\nof the normal consciousness and will. He believed that what\nwas most wanted in our researches was further experimenta\ntion on different forms of automatism. Automatic writing was\none most important method of getting at the contents of the\nsubliminal mind, but few persons could practise it to any\ngood effect. There were, however, many who could use other\n\" autoscopes,\" as he had called them,\u2014who could, for instance,\ntilt tables or cause a ring suspended by their fingers,\u2014the\npendule explorateur,\u2014to vibrate ; this and the Dowsing rod were\n\f52 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1907.\ntwo of the simplest and best forms of \" autoscope.\" The move\nments of the dowsing rod, which were due to the unconscious\nmuscular action of the person holding it, revealed subconscious\nideas in his mind. If he had a subconscious impression (whether\nderived from clairvoyance or from some other cause, such as\nimagination) of the presence of underground water, the rod would\nmove in his hands. A few persons, of whom Miss Miles was one,\nwere able to visualise the impressions obtained in this way, so\nas to become conscious of them. Thus Miss Miles, who was an\nexpert dowser, when going over a tract of land to find under\nground water, did not use a rod at all, but actually visualised\nthe water in certain spots; and in some cases where these\nimpressions of hers had been tested, they had been found to\nbe correct. Most dowsers, however, were aware of nothing\nbeyond the movement of the rod in their hands, but the\nultimate mental process was no doubt the same in all cases.\nThe rod, or any small object held in the hand to reveal\nits unconscious muscular action, can be used in searching for\nany hidden objects and not only water. If a coin e.g. is\nhidden under a carpet, a person who tries to find it may be\nable to do so by means of the movement of the rod. This\nis a simple form of experiment which any one can try. It\nis of course important that any person who knows where the\nhidden object is should carefully avoid giving indications to\nthe searcher ; in fact, it would be much better that none of\nthe persons watching him, or even in the same room with\nhim, should know, because it is practically impossible to avoid\nindications that may be subliminally perceived. It is obvious\nthat simple experiments in thought-transference may be devised\nalong these lines, and perhaps greater success would result\nthan has been found by the more ordinary methods.\nCASE.\nG. 281. \"Haunted House.\"\nIn the following case, we have by request substituted\nthroughout assumed names for the real ones in the original\ndocuments, which are in our possession. Mrs. Fletcher,\nformerly Mrs. Eussell, called on the Secretary and gave a\n\fAPRIL, 1907. 53\nCase.\nverbal account of the case ; afterwards she sent a written\nreport, with supplementary statements from some of the other\nwitnesses. The case would have been printed some time ago\nbut that it was hoped that further testimony would be forth\ncoming. Mrs. Fletcher's account is as follows :\nJuly 20th, 1904.\n(1) The house in which the incidents to be described occurred is an\nElizabethan manor house. My first husband, Captain Russell, and\nI took it in 1876, and made some additions and a few alterations,\nbut with the exception of abolishing a staircase in the East corridor,\nmaking the East room into two rooms\u2014called East and White\u2014\nand blocking up a doorway between the South room and the Oak\nroom, the portion of the house mentioned in the following state\nment, viz. : Oak Hall, oak staircase with upper corridor along two\nsides of Oak Hall, East corridor, East bedroom, South room and\nOak room, and the Dining room, have not been altered or re\nmodelled or done anything to. [See rough diagram, not drawn to\nscale, of the first floor of this part of the house.]\nNURSERIES, ETC\n~ SWING-DOOR\nOAK\nROOM\nEAST\nDRESSING ROOM\nBATH\nROOM\nSOUTH ROOM\nINNER\nBATH\nROOM\nWHITE\nROOM\nEAST\nROOM\nOwing to an appointment Captain Eussell held in the Navy, we\ndid not take up our residence at the house till late in 1880, and\nthough I heard servants' vague gossip as to the house being haunted,\nI saw nothing myself till one afternoon either quite at the end of\nApril or at the beginning of May, 1881. An old friend of mine,\nMiss James (now dead), was staying here, and we had been picking\na quantity of primroses to send away the next day. She occupied\nthe East room, and myself (as always) the South room on the first\nfloor. The other rooms in this part of the house\u2014East dressing\n\f54 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1907.\nroom, White room, and Oak room\u2014were empty, and, with the Oak\nstaircase going down into the Oak Hall, they are completely shut\noff by a glass swing door from the rest of the house (nurseries,\nschoolroom, smaller bedrooms, etc.), and unless specially rung for,\nno servants are there after doing their usual work. I was standing\nin my door-way in the South room about 4 o'clock on this after\nnoon, when I saw a figure pass, from my right to left, along the\ncorridor at top of Oak staircase ; but as the doors of South and\nWhite rooms are in a kind of alcove in the thickness of the wall,\nI could not see if it went into the Oak room or along the corridor\ntowards the glass swing door, but it certainly did not go down\nthe Oak staircase, which was in my sight. The figure moved very\nquickly, with head bent low down on folded arms. It was clothed\nin black, with a hood or cowl with a white lining thrown back,\nand there were pipings, or folds of white, on the drapery. Although\nI knew Miss James was not dressed like this, I took it for granted\nit was she, and at once went to the Oak room, where we usually\nkept the flowers for packing, saying as I opened the door, \"Never\nmind the primroses. It is too late to pack them now.\" No one\nwas in the room. I then went to the East room, where I found\nMiss James, who had not left it. I told her what I had seen, and\nhave often spoken of it.\nWe left the house from 1881 to 1884. In October, 1884, one\nevening I saw a figure in black and white drapery standing at the\ntop of lower half of Oak staircase, where the stairs form a right\nangle, and where there is a small landing. I was in the Oak Hall,\nlooking up the staircase. It appeared to me as if white drapery were\nfolded round the shoulders. The same year I caught a momentary\nglimpse of the figure descending the Oak staircase, whilst I was\npassing along the corridor alone.\nOne morning in February, 1886, when I was in bed in the South\nroom, about ten days after the birth of my third girl, Eglantine,\nmy monthly nurse, Mrs. H., came in from an inner bathroom,\nleading out of my room to the South, (not the door giving on the\ncorridor and Oak staircase,) put down a basin very hurriedly,\nreturned to the inner bathroom, and came back after a few moments\nlooking disturbed and annoyed, and said somewhat imperatively,\n\" Mrs. Russell, I can allow no one in your room during my\nabsence.\" I replied, \"No one has been in,\" to which she answered\nindignantly, \"Why, when I came in with the basin just now I\nsaw Agatha by the foot of your bed. She must not come in. I\n\fAPRIL, 1907. Case. 55\nwill not allow it\"; and forthwith she hunted up Agatha, who was\nin the nursery with the children's nurse, and began to scold her\ntill Agatha proved an alibi \\ Mrs. H. then passed it off as a reflec\ntion in the panels of my wardrobe, but afterwards, when I was\nwell again, she said she distinctly saw a woman standing at the foot\nof my bed, dressed in black, with white drapery on her shoulders\nand white piping or pleating on the skirt; and as Agatha, who\nwas my maid, habitually wore a black dress with white muslin\n\"fichu\" and small apron, she thought it was she.\nIn 1897, Captain Russell told me he saw a black-hooded figure\nin the White room, which he was occupying.\nIn 1891, a great friend of mine, Rev. Thomas Dixon, occupied\nthe White room, and one morning came down to breakfast obviously\ngreatly disturbed. He told me that whilst lying in bed wide awake,\na bright fire burning, he saw a hooded figure standing in one corner\nof the room. It was quite distinct, and remained for some little\ntime and then vanished.\nIn 1891, my eldest son saw a figure in black pass along the Oak\nHall corridor, pass the Oak room, and disappear through the closed\ndoor of White room ; and the same year Miss Margaret Stewart,\nwho was staying here, saw it in the same place.]\nIn 1896, Miss Atkins Church saw it in the White room, which\nshe was then occupying.\nIn June, 1900, Mrs. Atkins Church on going into the East room,\nwhich she was occupying, saw a woman in a black dress standing\nwith her back towards her at the far end of the room by the\ndressing table, and, thinking it was my children's nurse, said,\n\"Well, nurse, can I do anything for you?\" whereupon the figure\nfaded away.\nIn June, 1901, my eldest son asked me one morning 'if I had\nnoticed anything during dinner the preceding evening, and on my\nreplying, No, he questioned me several times, and at last said,\n\"Well, the dark lady was standing behind your chair during the\nsoup course.\"\nOn Nov. 5th, 1902, I met our governess, Miss Hall, the other\nside of the swing glass door leading to the nursery, went through\nthis door, followed after a moment or two by her, and to the\n(empty) drawing room. After a little she asked me if Mr. Fletcher,\nmy present husband, had come downstairs with me. I replied, \" No.\nHe went to the Library quite ten minutes before I met you near\nthe nursery.\" She then said she had seen a figure in black pass\n\f56 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1907.\nthrough the swing glass door in front of me, go down the corridor\nand into the Oak room (which is his dressing room), and she was\nelectrified at seeing him, as she thought, swing the glass door in\nmy face, and waited till I was well ahead of her, as she didn't wish\nhim (in the Oak room, as she supposed) to hear her make any\nremark.\nI enclose the account of Jan. 18th, 1903, of my daughter,\nEglantine (aged 17), and also that of Mr. Fletcher's niece, Miss\nDorothy Fletcher (aged 19).\nIn May this year Eglantine saw the figure follow me along the\ncorridor. She told me at the time, but we forgot to write down\nthe date.\nNo one has ever seen the face of the figure. It is invariably\nin black and white. I do not know of any misfortune attendant\non seeing it, though certainly Mr. Dixon died very suddenly about\na year after his vision, and Mrs. Atkins Church lost her only son\ntwo months after her experience. Beyond a vague story of a,\nlaundry-maid having been strangled ages ago, I know of no story\nconnected with the house. The old laundry was in the West wing,\nquite remote from the East and Oak corridors. Very sad family\ntroubles, of quite different orders, came to my sister and myself in\n1881, which is the only time I saw the figure absolutely distinctly.\nI do not know if the figure belongs to the house or to me.\nOne of the attic bedrooms over the East room had a curious\nstone kind of seat, like a coffin almost, or rather a sarcophagus,\nbuilt out of the wall. This was removed without my knowledge,\nand I do not know if it contained anything. Servants sleeping in this\nroom have averred they felt a cold damp hand passed over their\nfaces. In the old part of the West wing, a perfectly trustworthy\nwitness told me she had seen a man in his shirt sleeves go up the\nstaircase in front of her and into the West bedroom. She thought\nhe was a workman, and followed him into the room\u2014to find it\nempty !\nI add a rough plan of the corridors and staircase where the\ndark lady has been seen\u2014perhaps \" gallery \" is a better word to\nuse than corridor for the two sides round Oak Hall, as they are\nopen to the roof. [This plan is reproduced above.]\nIn 1902, my daughter Eglantine was looking into a crystal, and\nsaw the \" dark lady \" standing with her arms folded, cowl over\nhead, head bent to her arms, in strongest moonlight in the Oak\nHall, but described the thickly carpeted floor as a black and white\n\fAPRIL, 1907. Case. 57\npavement. Under the carpet, now removed, there is a very fine\nstone pavement with black marble diamonds let in.\nNo one is quite certain whether it is a woman's figure, or a\nmonk in robes and cowl, except Dorothy Fletcher.\nMrs. Fletcher adds on July 30th, 1904:\nI have found a pencil scribble note that my son last saw the\nDark Lady behind my chair in [the] dining-room, Wednesday,\nMay 21st, 1902.\nMiss Eglantine Eussell writes :\nAt about five minutes to eight on Jan. 18th, 1903, I was\nstanding by the stained-glass door by the nursery, watching Mother\ngo down the passage to her room. As she got on a level with\nthe Oak room door I saw a figure following her; it was dressed\nin black with a little white about it, and it seemed to follow\nMother into the alcove by the White room door. I thought\nat first it was Alexandra, but she was upstairs in her own room\nand no one had been along the passage except Mother.\nMiss Dorothy Fletcher writes :\nApril 29th, 1904.\nAt about ten minutes to seven on the evening of May 22nd,\n1900, I was walking up the front staircase. I was quite alone\nin that part of the house. When I got up about four steps, I\nsuddenly stopped with the feeling of another presence. Looking\nup I saw, to my no little surprise, the figure of a woman in\nblack coming down the top half of the stairs. She had her arms\nfolded, and her head rather bowed. She came down to the small\nlanding where the staircase forms a right angle, a few steps above\nme, and then disappeared. If it had not been for her clothes\nand sudden disappearance, I might easily have taken her for a\nhuman being. I could not see the face, as she was wearing a\nblack drapery which covered her head and formed a sort of mantle\nvery like the old pictures of Jewish women. I was not frightened\nby her. It was yet quite light and the sun shining. I walked\nup to where I had seen her and looked all round. There was no\nsign of anybody. I was not then aware that the \"dark lady\"\nhad been seen on the staircase, although I knew of her appearance\nin other parts of the house.\n(2) Another apparition frequently seen in the house is that\nof a little white dog, which Mrs. Fletcher describes as follows :\n\f58 Journal of Society for Psychical Research,. APRIL, 1907.\nJuly 29th, 1904.\nThe little white dog first made its appearance in Jan., 1900.\nMy husband, Mr. Fletcher, came out of the Library, where he had\nbeen sitting alone, one afternoon, and said to me, \"I saw a white\ndog in the Library just now.\" I laughed and said, \"Not unlikely,\"\nas our two, Juno and Nipper, are always about ; but he looked\nvery grave, and replied, \" I do not mean one of your dogs. I was\nwriting in the Library just now, and saw a small white dog go\nround the table towards the door, which was shut. I th&ught it\nwas Nipper and got up to open the door for her, and then found\nthere was no dog in the room at all.\"\nAfter this the little canine apparition was seen frequently by\nourselves, our servants, and our guests, including Miss Plumtre,\nwhose account I enclose, and her brother, who saw it outside the\nhouse; but I have kept no dates unfortunately, except in the\nfollowing cases, and Miss Hall's enclosure.\nOne evening in Dec., 1900, Miss Hall, my daughter Eglantine\nand I were carrying a lot of Christmas parcels from the Drawing\nroom up to my boudoir, which leads out of it up a narrow and\nvery steep staircase. I went first with a large tray in my hands;\nMiss Hall next, carrying a candle (there was no light on the\nstairs) ; Eglantine last.\nAs I reached the top steps of the staircase, where the staircase\nturns a little and the steps on the banister side are fined away to\nnothing, I felt a dog press past me, between the banisters and my\nlegs, on the banister side. We had been joking about the two\nterriers who never leave me, and wondering if they would follow me\nout of the drawing room, where they had been playing with the\nstring and paper of the parcels, and when I felt this, I said,\n\"Well, here's one of them at all events.\" Miss Hall said, \"Yes,\nI saw it go up the stairs,\" and Eglantine said, \"I don't know\nwhich one it was, but its nose touched my leg.\" When we got\ninto the boudoir no dog was there, and I at once went down\nagain to the drawing room, where both dogs were asleep. The\npart of my leg, midway between knee and hip, against which the\ndog had pressed, had a curious tingling sensation for several hours,\nand I described it as \"a cold burn.\" Eglantine was not in the\nroom when I said this, but shortly afterwards she said to me,\n\" Mother, where the dog's nose touched my leg feels just like a\ncold burn.\"\nThe boudoir staircase is so steep, and the steps are so much\n\fAPBIL, 1907. Case. 59\nfined away at the turn, that no living dog could have got between\nme and the banister.\nIn June, 1901, I saw the white dog so distinctly in an outdoor\ngreenhouse one afternoon that, thinking it was Nipper, I said,\n\"Hullo, little dog. What are you doing in here?\" and just then\none of the children outside called to me, \"Mother, if you want\nyour little dog, she is hiding in the bushes out here.\"\nI have these brief notes :\nTuesday, May 20th, 1902. Mr. Fletcher saw the white dog\nbetween the glass swing door and nursery.\nSunday, May 25th, 1902. Eglantine saw the white dog in Oak\nroom about 8.30 p.m.\nThe undated apparitions were :\nOne afternoon (probably in 1901) when I was coming into the\nOak Hall, through a swing door from the outer hall with my son,\nI noticed he kept this swing door open after I had passed through.\nI looked back to see why, and he said, \"It's for your little dog,\nMother. I am afraid of treading on her.\" There was no dog there,\nbut he distinctly saw one following me.\nThe other was one evening when we had as usual let the terriers\nout for a run before bedtime. I was calling Nipper, and Miss\nHall said, \"I do wonder you call your little dog when she is\nclose beside you.\" Both Juno and Nipper were out of doors, but\nshe saw a white dog lying down close to my dress.\nI once in my bedroom (South room) felt a dog lay its paws on\nmy lap. We have all of us heard a dog come up the boudoir stairs,\nbut this sounds a much heavier tread than that of our terriers ;\nand of course the dog that pushed past me on the stairs must\nhave been larger, as both our terriers are very low on the leg.\nI can trace no sort of story connected with the vision. Before\nNipper came into my possession thirteen years ago, I had a similar\nrough-coated white terrier, also a great favourite.\nEglantine saw the apparition some time in May this year, 1904.\nThe governess, Miss Hall, writes as follows :\nJuly 30th, 1904.\nOne night when in the Oak Hall just before going to bed, the\ntwo dogs went out for a run. Whilst waiting for them to come\nin, I thought I saw Mrs. Fletcher's special little dog close by the\ntable which was in the middle of the hall. As she still kept call\ning her in, I said, \" Why do you still call J I saw Nipper by the\ntable.\" Nipper was still outside with the other dog.\n\f60 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1907.\nOne afternoon I was writing in the schoolroom (my back to the\ndoor) when I heard the door open and shut, but on turning round\nI saw no one. A short time after, the maid came in to get tea\nready, I asked her if she had opened the door a short time\nbefore. She replied, \"I saw the little dog lying on the mat and\nopened the door to let it in.\"\nOn Nov. 5th, 1902, when approaching the swing glass door\nbetween nursery and Oak Hall gallery, to go down to dinner, I\nsaw Mrs. Fletcher before me, coming from the nursery; and in\nfront of her I saw a figure in black pass through the swing glass\ndoor and let it close in her face. Mr. Fletcher is in the habit of\ngoing to the nursery with Mrs. Fletcher before dinner, and I thought\nthe figure was he, and was much astonished to see the door shut\nin her face. I did not follow immediately, so did not see in which\ndirection the figure went, but was under the impression it went to\nthe Oak room. I waited a few minutes, so that Mr. Fletcher should\nnot hear me, and then asked Mrs. Fletcher if he had not been in\nfront of her when she left the nursery. She replied that he had\ngone to the Library quite ten minutes before she was dressed for\ndinner, and had not been to the nursery with her at all.\nMiss Plumtre, one of the ladies referred to in Mrs. Fletcher's\naccount, writes as follows, the account being enclosed in a\nletter from Mrs. Fletcher, dated August 1st, 1904:\nI had come over for painting lesson, but Mary was still out, so\nI went up to her room and washed for lunch. When I got to the\nbottom of the staircase, I met Miss Hall carrying a vase of flowers,\nso I opened the swing door to let her pass into the front part of\nthe house. I noticed an ordinary white terrier following her, so I\nheld open the door to let it pass through also. Then through the\nglass I watched it, and saw the dog suddenly vanish into nothing.\nIt did not run down the stairs, or disappear into one of the rooms,\nit simply was not ! I thought this rather funny, so afterwards\nspoke to Mary about it. \"Oh, don't you know? That must be\nthe Dog Ghost that you have seen.\" It was winter time, but the\nexact date I have forgotten\u2014about two years and a quarter ago.\nA more recent appearance of the little white dog was\ndescribed by Miss Eglantine Eussell, about three weeks after\nshe saw it, as follows :\nWhile at dinner on August 4th, 1904, I looked quickly down\nand saw a white terrier pass between myself and my neighbour,\n\fAPRIL, 1907. Case. 61\nand go under the table. This I saw quite distinctly \u2022 I don't remember\nseeing the head of the dog, which would almost be hidden under\nthe cloth, as it was making its way under the table. I was so\nconvinced that only my mother saying quietly, \"Nipper is by the\nparrot's cage,\" made me realise that it was not one of our dogs\nwalking from one side of the room to the other. The other terrier\nwas not in the room. My impression was so strong that I would\nhave been prepared to swear I saw Nipper go past me. The gentle\nman sitting by me did not see anything.\nWith regard to this case, Mrs. Fletcher writes :\nAugust 23rd, 1904.\nDuring dinner on Thursday, 4th August, 1904, I noticed Eglantine\nlean towards her right-hand neighbour and look down between her\nchair and his, and thinking she was looking for my terrier Nipper,\nabout whom we are always anxious at meals, as she is stone deaf\nand likely to get trodden upon, I said,\" \"Nipper is asleep behind\nyou, by the parrot cage.\" After dinner E. told me she had seen a\nwhite dog go under the table, between her neighbour and herself.\nI can vouch for the fact Nipper did not leave the place by\nthe parrot cage the whole of dinner. She was there in my full\nview all the time.\nOn March 13th, 1905, Mrs. Fletcher wrote enclosing the\nfollowing accounts by herself and Miss Hall of later appearances\nof the dog :\nMarch 1st, 1905.\nAbout 10.30 p.m. on January 15, 1905, I opened my window to\nput out seed for the birds on the sill, and knowing Simon, my\nfox-terrier who sleeps in my room, would be roused by the sound\nand spring up on the window seat from behind me. which always\nstartles me, I said to myself, \"Now don't be frightened when\nSimon jumps up\u2014you know he always does so.\" At that moment\nI felt a dog's nose and head poked under my elbow\u2014just as Simon\ndoes if he wants us to do anything for him, and I turned round\nsaying, \"It's no good, old boy; there are no rats here to-night.\"\nI then found there was nothing near me, and Simon was asleep in\nhis basket, with his blanket over him, quite undisturbed.\nMarch 1st, 1905.\nOn the evening of January 15th, 1905, as I came from the nursery\nthrough the glass door into the corridor round the Oak Hall, I saw\na dog which I took to be Simon lying down just through the\n\f62 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1907.\ndoor (as he often does), and I . raised my foot so as to avoid\nstepping on him, and then found there was nothing there.\nH. A. HALL.\n(3) The following are accounts enclosed in a letter from\nMrs. Fletcher, dated August 23rd, 1904, of an apparition\nseen collectively by Mrs. Fletcher's three daughters in the\npark belonging to their house. Miss Eglantine Eussell writes :\nOn December 22nd, 1897, I was walking through the fields near\nthe house with my sisters, Edith and Eose (both older than myself).\nIt was quite a sunny afternoon, between three and four o'clock.\nResting at a fence we stopped to talk, myself sitting on the top\nrailing, the others standing below. Looking across the corner of\nthe field by an oak tree in the fence, I remember seeing an object,\nbut listening to the others talking, I didn't take much notice whether\nit was man, horse, or cow. Presently Eose, looking up, said,\n\"There's one of the boys,\" looking across in the same direction.\n\"Yes,\" I replied, \"I thought I saw them.\" \"No, it isn't,\" Eose\ncontinued; \"it's a man. Who is it, I wonder? Who can be\nwandering about up here 1 We'd better go and see.\" We started\nfor the other hedge, which was, I should think, about 50 yards distant.\nWe had a fox terrier with us ; he growled, and his ruff stood up,\nand he refused to come. I cannot now remember whether my sister\nEdith walked across with us, or, being nervous, stayed by the\nfence. My impression is she came, but a trifle behind Eose and\nmyself. Walking closer, I saw that it was a man, hanging apparently\nfrom an oak tree in front of some railings over a ditch. He was\ndressed in brown, rather brighter than the colour of brown holland ;\nhe did not seem to have a regular coat, but more of a loose blouse.\nOne thing I most distinctly recall is his heavy clumsy boots. His\nface we could not see ; there was something white over it. The\nhead hung forward, and the arms drooped forward too. Coming\nwithin about 15 yards I saw the shadow of the railings through\nhim, one bar across the shoulders, one bar about his waist, and\none almost at his knees, quite distinct, but faint. I have a\nremembrance of a big, very black shadow in the background. At\nabout 15 yards the whole thing disappeared absolutely. We went\nto the railing and looked over a clear field beyond, which would\ngive no possible cover to any one trying to hide. Walking back to\nwhere we had first seen it we saw nothing but an oak tree by\nrailings in a fence. While I saw it my only feeling, I remember,\n\fAPRIL, 1907. Case. 63\nwas intense Curiosity to see what it was,\u2014one seemed impelled to\ngo forward; afterwards, sickening terror.\nThis is some years ago, but writing brings it all back to me.\nThere may be some details I have forgotten ; but this is the account\nas it stands clearly in my mind.\nMiss Edith Eussell (now Mrs. Shaw) writes :\nI am writing down exactly what I saw, in conjunction with\nmy two sisters.\nIt was on Dec. 23rd, 1897 (?). We were walking across some\nfields to meet my brothers who were out shooting with a neigh\nbour. We stopped to wait for them, and sat on a fence half way\nacross a field about 80 or 90 yards wide. My youngest sister\nsuddenly remarked that there was a man looking over the fence\nat the far end of the field. I made some answer as to its\nprobably being one of the boys. Presently my other sister said\n\"There is a man there,\" or words to that effect, and I looked up,\nand distinctly saw what looked like a man leaning over the fence.\nWe then said we would find out what it was, and all three\nwalked in a row towards the figure. When within about 20\nyards, my youngest sister said, \" Look at his legs ! \" I remarked\nto my other sister, \" What is it ? I don't like it.\" We walked\non, after having said we would report to each other what we\nsaw, as we went. This is what we all three saw : a man's figure\nhanging from a branch of an oak tree, his arms and legs dangling\napparently helplessly, and his head hung forward, but it was\ncovered with something white. We could see the railings which\nran behind the oak tree through the figure. When we got within\n10 yards, my sister said, \"Why, it's gone.\" We stopped and\nlooked, and there was nothing to be seen but the oak tree and\nfence. It was a very bright sunny afternoon \u2022 there was a little\nsnow on the ground.\nOne thing struck us as odd, for between the sun and the oak\ntree was a great black shadow, which we could not account for,\nas in the ordinary course of events the shadow would be on the\nopposite side of the tree to where the sun was.\nThis is absolutely true, and I have put it down just as I\nremember it.\nMrs. Fletcher, writing on August 23rd, 1904, says that\nthese accounts were given quite independently of each other\nand also of her second daughter's version of the same\n\f64 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APHIL, 1907.\nincident, which she gives herself as follows, as this daughter\nwas unwilling to write it :\nOn Dec. 23, 1897, my second daughter Rose, aged 18, told me\nthat whilst she and her elder sister Edith, aged 21, and her youngest\nsister Eglantine, aged 12, were in the park that afternoon, they\nhad seen a \" vision,\" which she described as follows. The three\ngirls were waiting for their brothers by a fence, and the youngest\ndrew the attention of the others to a man standing by the hedge\nin the same field as themselves to the left\u2014and there they all three\nsaw the figure of a man in brown clothes, with something white\nacross his face, dangling from the bough of an oak tree a few\nyards nearer to them than the fence. Rose described the head\nlolling forward and the arms and legs all limp, and the three girls\nsaw the hedge and some palings in it through the figure. They walked\ntowards it, and it melted away. Eglantine mentioned also a \"sort\nof dark thing near the figure.\" We have frequently been to the\nsame spot on 23rd Dec. at three o'clock, but seen nothing. There\nis a vague legend that some one was murdered somewhere near the\nplace, and two fields off there are two stones with very large bases\nlike gate-posts below the surface of the ground, marked each with a\ncross and + on one, + + on the other.\nG G^\nThree years ago Eglantine, who had never seen a \" crystal,\" went\nwith me on 23rd Dec. to the place where she and her sisters saw\nthe vision. I told her to look into the crystal. She almost immedi\nately saw in it a long oak-panelled room, with two portraits hanging\non the wall of men in old-fashioned uniforms, with young faces\nand \"grey hair,\"\u2014no doubt powder.\nAlso, in 1901, my daughter Edith, looking into a crystal for the\nfirst time, saw a series of pictures, of which I have the following\nrough notes :\n(1) Bright landscape; a tree.\n(2) Men entirely in white fighting a duel. One man was forced\nto his knees, and in this position ran the other man several times\nthrough the body ; eventually he got up, stabbed his adversary\nagain, and fell back.\n(3) A gateway, with two towers; lanterns waving.\n(4) A small dark room, like a prison; a man in white pacing\nrestlessly up and down.\n(5) A picture; a tree; a figure.\n\fNo. CCXXXIX.\u2014VOL.

Warndorfer, a Member of the Society\nresiding at Baden, near Vienna, who writes :\nJuly 11th, 1906.\nI had occasion to hear of a \" spook \" case in Vienna, and to witness\nsome of the alleged occurrences, and I report here what I heard\nfrom witnesses, and what I saw for myself. At the beginning of\nthis month I read in the Neues Wiener TagUatt an account of a spook\nin a Vienna suburb, relating in a jocular way that things were\nflying about in a smith's shop, that the owner of the shop was very\nmuch put out about it, and that the communal authorities would\ndoubtless soon put a stop to this nonsense. I was not able to go\nto the place for eight days ; when I went there on Monday, the\n16th, I heard the following account:\nI will, however, first describe the locality and the inhabitants.\nThe shop, Lerchenfelderstr. 158, is at the end of a long court in\na large house inhabited by tradespeople and workmen ; it is situated\nin the \"souterrain,\" and one goes down to it by a short open stair\nand along an open area. It is the last shop on the right of the\nhouse ; next to it is a shop where scales and weights are made ;\nin the next house there is a mechanic who uses a dynamo machine.\nThe place I refer to is hired by a man called Job. Zimmerl, aged,\nI think, 63; he works there with two apprentices, aged about 15\nand 18. He has been in this place for about four years. The\nworkshop is very poorly furnished with old machinery, driven by\nhand, and rather dark. I add sketches of the situation of the shop\nand of its arrangements.\nThe man told me that he was very much disturbed by things\n\u2014tools, bits of iron, screws, his pipe, etc.\u2014being thrown off the\nbenches and flung about ; he had a stiff hat on so as to protect his\nhead against the objects ; he showed me a lump on the back of\nhis head, caused, as he said, by a piece of iron ; one of the boys\nhad a red spot on his cheek bone, caused in a similar way. He\ntold me that he did not think his apprentices could have played\nhim tricks, as he had watched them, and as objects had been flying\nabout while they were outside, and from a direction opposite to\nwhere they stood, and where there was only solid wall. He had\n\fMAY, 1907. 67\nReport of a \"Poltergeist\" Case.\n1 STAII I\n!\nSHOP\nAREA\n1\nEIGHBOUR'5\nHOUSE\nYARD\n%% SMITHY s~\\\n55 (BELLOWS.)\n52\ns~\\ ^y\n*=\u00a3L_Jr> ANVIL\nUJ\n^-S\n1\u2014\n1\n*< \u2022^x^-\nx: <n\n(\"7 o LJ\ns\nUJ _1\nz GO U\nQC FLY WHEEL r\n(A\nDOOR ^\nl- r^^ ^^i QC\n0\nWINDOW\ni i\n^yy\/\/^^\/ ^\n* Mr. Warndorfer's usual place of observation.\n\f68 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1907.\nbeen to the police, and some officials had been there to examine\nthe walls, etc., but had found nothing unusual, the walls, etc.,\nbeing solid and in good order. While I was there an electrician\ncame to examine the place with instruments of precision, as it\nwas thought that the neighbour's dynamo might have caused cur\nrents ; he found nothing at all, i.e. there were no electric or magnetic\nreactions whatever. I was there for about an hour, but saw nothing\nmyself, though earlier in the day a wooden model was said to have\nflown across the room from its place high up on a wall; the hook\nfrom which it had hung was there still, and the string on which it\nhad hung was intact.\nI went there after a few days again. I found that all the tools\nhad been removed from the shop into wooden boxes and put out\nside, the man being afraid to work while they were lying loose ;\nhe told me that a rather heavy hammer had whirled close past\nhis head several times ; he was much scared, and lamented the loss\nof his time and the loss of customers, as some would not come\nnear, being frightened, while others kept away \" from an old fool\nwho talks such nonsense.\"\nSince my last visit some spiritists had \" sat \" with the boys\nat night, and some phenomena seem to have occurred. I have not\nhad occasion to look them up yet, but mean to do so ; some other\nspiritist had brought \" writing mediums,\" the result being uninterest\ning. The phenomena had increased, according to Z. and the boys'\naccounts. They had seen a pipe fly from one side of the shop to\nthe other and back, and settle on the anvil in the middle of\nthe room ; once the pipe was taken from Z.'s mouth and fluttered\non to the turning lathe ; once it got up by itself from a lying\ninto a standing position on its clay head (it consists, as is customary\nhere, of a long wooden stem with a clay head), and then made a\nvicious \"peck\" and broke its head. Z. had by this time given up\nsmoking in the shop on account of so many pipes having been\nbroken. His notebook was said to have flown out of the window\n\" like a butterfly,\" and the hat of one of the boys had been\nremoved from his head repeatedly. I remained there for about a\n\u2022couple of hours, but saw nothing; I spoke to several neighbours,\nwho affirmed they had seen or heard things fly about.\nI came again next day\u2014Saturday last\u2014determined to remain for the\nwhole day. When I arrived, about 8.30, Z. was just returning\nfrom some newspaper offices, where he had been to fetch reporters ;\nhe also brought a policeman with him. He was quite beside him\n\fMAY, 1907. Report of a \" Poltergeist \" Case. 69\nself, two petroleum lamps having been smashed during the night,\nand by then seven window panes broken ; moreover, all his tools were\nmixed up ; he dared not go into his shop, and raved about the\nauthorities not being able to stop such impossible goings on, and\nnot protecting him, letting him be ruined, etc., etc. Several news\npaper reporters had arrived by this time, and we watched all the\nmorning without seeing anything, till 12, when the shop was closed.\n(A)1 On the evening before an open round tin box containing\nplaster of Paris was said to have been thrown on to the ceiling\nand then trailed on the floor ; I noticed the marking on the blackened\nceiling as peculiar; it was in shape like a comet, with a nucleus\nand a tail ; all the particles were quite round, and I cannot conceive\nof any means to produce such a marking without showing some\ntrace of \"wiping along.\" If it had been blown on or put on\nwith a brush, or thrown on in the ordinary way, some of the plaster\nparticles would undoubtedly have scraped along and formed lines\nor smears. When I returned in the afternoon on the shop being\nopened, I saw at once that the white mark was altered ; part of\nthe \" tail \" looked as if a soft brush had been passed over it ; I\nthink that the mark altered its shape during the afternoon as well,\nbut I am not quite sure about it.\nI arrived there at 1.10 and found the boys just opening the\nplace and carrying the boxes with tools outside ; shortly afterwards\nZ. arrived and started some job that he had to finish at once.\nDuring the next three hours I saw, heard, or felt exactly 30 objects\nbeing thrown about. With about 12 or 15 objects I am perfectly\ncertain that none of the persons present can have thrown them.\n(B) One of them was thrown when I was momentarily alone in the\nshop, coming apparently from the smithy. I never saw any of the\nobjects actually fly ; with most of them I heard only the fall, with\nsome I heard a slight noise, indicating the direction from which\nthey came. Some dropped quite close to me, three struck me on\nthe head.\n(C) The first phenomenon that I witnessed there was a piece of iron\nabout the size of a walnut touching me quite lightly on the top of\nmy felt hat, and from there dropping on the floor; I didn't know\nat first what it was that touched me. The middle (top) part of my\nhat was folded in, almost touching the top of my head. The piece of\n1 We designate the various incidents by letters, to facilitate reference to the\nfurther descriptions of the same given in Mr. Warndorfer's later reports\nbelow.\n\f70 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1907.\niron must have jumped out again, as otherwise it could not have fallen\non to the ground.\n(D and E) Later on I was struck by a small blade of steel on\nthe back of the neck, and the third time by a fragment of a clay\npipe ; this and some other small pieces which flew about I had\ndeposited on a wooden shelf on the wall, where they were well\nout of the reach of the boys' ordinary manipulation. There were\nseveral people present, watching through the window and standing\nin the doorway, but I do not think any of them can be connected\nwith the phenomenon. The more people came, the scarcer they\ngrew.\n(F) The last happened at about 4.30. The smith had gone out\nof the shop soon after the \" spook \" began, lamenting his fate, and\nfinding evidently some consolation in the curiosity of the neighbours\nto hear the latest developments. I stood most of the time in the\nmiddle of the shop, keeping my eyes on the boys, my back turned\nto the smithy. About 4.30 I watched the boys drilling a hole in\na piece of iron, their hands and evidently their attention being\nfully occupied. Suddenly the younger of the two screamed out\nand was nearly bent double with pain and fright, while an iron\nmeasuring instrument flew on to the floor; it had struck him pretty\nsharply on the left temple, causing a swelling and a drop of blood.\nI had noticed the instrument a little time before lying on the work\nbench, about a yard behind the boy.\nThe objects that flew about in my presence were mostly light,\ntheir weight never exceeding about \\ Ib. I have read up most of\nthe cases mentioned in your Proceedings, and do not think I was\nin any way careless in my observations. I shall get back to Vienna\nto-morrow and visit the place again on Monday, and let you know\nif anything further has occurred.\nA. WARNDORFER.\nP.S.\u2014I forgot to mention that it was found out by one of the\nreporters that at the beginning of this year a man who lived in a\nsmall room just above the shop with his parents, complained about\nhis furniture being moved about, an ink-bottle being spilt (the\nsame happened in the shop, Z.'s hat and shirt being covered with\nink), the door of his cupboard being thrown open suddenly, etc.\nHis parents thought he had gone mad, and did not attach any\nimportance to his words. He left the room about March, and\nfrom that time up to the beginning of this month nothing has\nhappened.\n\fMAY, 1907. Report of a \" Poltergeist \" Case. 71\nVarious circumstances having prevented Mr. Warndorfer from\nsending us further details at the time, we enquired again about\nthe case early this year, and received the following report.\nWe have added reference letters in brackets, corresponding with\nthe reference letters by which the same incidents are desig\nnated in the first account.\nMarch 26th, 1907.\nI wrote to you at the beginning of last summer about some\n\"spook\" phenomena which I had occasion to observe. I herewith\nsend you sketches [not reproduced here] and a more detailed account\n(as asked for by you), and the account of the rather\u2014or apparently\u2014\nignominious end of the affair. The spook, i.e. the flying about of\n\u2022objects, their disappearance, etc., began about the middle of May,\n1906. The notes I took, containing the different dates, were un\nfortunately lost through my having moved into another house ;\nthe sketches I enclose here were, however, taken at the time, one\nat the place itself. All the cases were observed in daylight, and I\ndid my best to keep the boys within eyesight. I think myself\njustified in stating that in the five cases of which I am going to\nspeak first, the chances of malobservation were very small indeed.\nIt is true I never had the chance of observing similar phenomena\nbefore, but in this case I certainly had plenty of opportunity for\nobservation. I was at the smith's shop ten or twelve times, some\ntimes a whole day. The number of phenomena personally observed\nwas considerable, on the \" best \" day 23 objects flying about in less\nthan half an hour. Altogether, I think I saw between 60 and 70\nobjects flying, or rather arriving.\n(G) On one occasion I saw a small picture, about 6x4 ins.,\nfluttering through the air, after having noticed it on its usual place\n\u2022on the wall [over the bench near the door] a few minutes before. I\nam specially certain of this circumstance, as the picture, which was\n\u2022a photograph of a church, a well-known place of pilgrimage, with a\nrepresentation of the Virgin Mary above, had often been mentioned by\nwomen coming to the shop as being naturally exempt from all spook\non account of its \"holy character\" and its having been sprinkled with\n\"holy water.\" On my arrival on that day all the loose objects along\nthe wall and on the long bench to the right of the door had either\nflown away or the heavy ones had been removed from fear of the\nthree occupants being hurt again by their flight, and it was pointed\nout to me that the sacred picture alone had never moved. I leant\ncasually on the bench, with my back to the wall, about a yard\n\f72 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1907.\nfrom the picture, and, as stated above, saw after a few minutes the\npicture fluttering to the middle of the shop in an almost parabolic\ndirection. It did not fall, but behaved rather like a sheet of\npaper; it did not break on the floor. As a rule the objects,\nhowever, seemed to be thrown with considerable violence. Besides\nthis I personally noticed only one other case, in which the velocity\nof flight was markedly less than the normal.\nThe phenomena went on for about two months. Zimmerl was by\nthen almost beside himself with fear and annoyance. He was\nunable to execute his orders, and at times did not dare to enter\nhis shop, having been hurt rather severely several times. One of\nhis eyes was inflamed and swollen by having had a quantity of\nmortar thrown into it, and his cheek had been wounded by a piece\nof iron. He had furthermore several bumps on his head. Naturally\na great many people, journalists, electricians, town clerks, policemen\n(but no scientific investigator), came to visit the shop; the daily\npapers cut their jokes about it, etc.\nAbout the middle of August I had to leave Vienna for a few\ndays, and did not see any local papers. On my return I went to\nsee Z. at once. I was met with ironical smiles and told that the\nwhole swindle had been cleared up, that the apprentices had been\ncaught red-handed by a detective, and that since the boys had been\nsent away there was nothing more to be heard. I was shown a\npaper in which the story was told in several pages (I being laughed\nat at some length), the police praised, and the boys accused of gross\nmisdemeanour. In the account of the boys' arrest there was one\nthing that really interested me ; it was said that the boys had\nowned up to having been the cause of the whole disturbance. On\nthe next day, a Sunday, one of the boys came to see me and\nentreated me to help him. He said he had never done anything\nwrong, and had not owned to anything except that he had tried\nwith his comrade, after the working hours, and only once, whether\nthey could produce effects similar to those that had been observed.\nI could of course only tell him that I could not prove that he had\nnot thrown anything, but that I rather suspected that he might be\nin for some of the pranks ; that I should be ready, however, to\nappear as witness on his behalf, and state what I had seen.\nThe next day I went to the police court, where I was met with\nall the gentle affability which, I suppose, is considered due to a\nharmless lunatic not dressed in rags. I managed to see the inspector\nwho had charge of the affair. He told me that a detective had for\n\fMAY, 1907. Report of a \" Poltergeist \" Case. 73\nsome time been at the shop, and on the day of the capture had\nnoticed that one of the boys, the one who had always been con\nsidered the medium, put his right hand frequently into his coat\npocket ; and, watching him, saw that at the moment the boy took\na handkerchief out of his pocket an iron ring flew against the wall.\nThereon the boy was arrested. The inspector confirmed the\nstatement that the boys had denied all guilt.\nI was not asked as witness when the ease was heard. The judge,\nvery rightly I think, would not have any discussion on occult matters\nin court, fined the boy 3 kronen (about 2s. 6d.), and dismissed the\nwhole case in less than ten minutes. I have not heard anything of\na recurrence of spooks at the shop, though Z. had promised to send\nme word if anything happened. The last time I saw him I asked\nhim whether he had not told me of phenomena he had himself\nobserved, of which the apprentices could not have been the cause.\nThis he admitted unwillingly, but said that as everything was all\nright since the boys had left, they must have been the cause.\nThis ending of the spook naturally did not prove anything to me,\nand I will give you the cases that seem to me important as\nevidence among the phenomena personally observed, including my\nobservations of carious traces left by other phenomena, and some of\nthe occurrences told to me by witnesses.\n(F) I stood near the anvil watching the boys working at a boring\nmachine [on the bench]. One turned the ratchet with one hand,\nturning the screw lever with the other ; the second boy (C) held\nthe iron to be bored and oiled the point of the borer. Suddenly\nhe cried out, letting go the piece and holding his head. At the\nsame time I saw a big iron compasses ricochetting, as it were, off the\nboy's head and falling to the ground. The boy was hit on his\nright temple, where a small bump was visible and some blood came.\nI had noticed the compasses lying on the bench about half an hour\nbefore. I am perfectly certain that the hands of the boys were\nbusy at the time with their work.\n(H) I was hit by some object on the right side of my head. I\nheard it fall on the floor, but we could not recover it.\n(B) I was alone in the shop, the others doing some work outside.\nI heard a slight noise in the smithy, and a small piece of steel\nflew, seemingly out of the smithy, on to the ground, where I saw\nit drop.\n(C) I stood [in the middle of the room] talking to Z. and the\nboys, who were having a rest. I felt a very slight touch on my hat,.\n\f74 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1907.\nthen the brim of my hat was touched, and a piece of iron dropped\nat my feet. I wore a light soft felt hat, the top of which was\nfolded in so that the inside of it almost touched my head. It was\nthere that I felt the touch, which was so slight as to resemble the\nlightest touch from a finger tip. The curious part was the heaviness\nof the iron piece, which must have jumped out of the cup which\nmy hat formed, dropped on to the brim, and from there fallen\nto the floor without touching my body. I kept the piece of iron,\nand send it you. I cannot imagine its having been thrown [on to\nmy head] without my feeling some pain. I was the tallest of those\npresent; there was nobody behind me.\n(I) Z. and the boys (a third had been engaged) were sitting on\nthe bench having their tea, or rather its Viennese equivalent. Z.\nsat with his back to me, smoking a pipe and grumbling. I sat on\na chair smoking. I felt a pain as from a sting on the left part of\nthe chest. Putting my hand there instinctively, under my jacket, I\nfound there a small bit of steel (which I send also), which must\nhave flown with such rapidity that it caused the sensation of a\nsting. The boys sat on my left, Z. with his back to me. The steel\nwas under my left coat side, about 4-5 ins. from its opening. There\nwas nobody else in the shop.\n(J) I sat on the bench, next to me was a neighbour, discussing\nthe phenomena with me in a most sceptical way ; the boys and Z.\nwere standing in the door and outside talking with some visitors;\nwork had been stopped, as too many things had been flying about\n(before my arrival), and tools had kept disappearing. I was playing\nwith a small copper plate. On my right side was the bellows,\nwhich filled the space between the bench on which I sat and the\nsmithy, so that nobody could stand or hide there ; besides, all the\nother people were outside or in the doorway, as mentioned. The\ndistance between myself and the wall may have been about a yard\nand a quarter. I was hit on the back of my right hand by an\niron screw with great violence, and felt a very intense pain ; some\nblood came at once, and a swelling was raised, which lasted for\nseveral months. The shock of the iron on the bone on the back of\nmy hand caused quite a sharp cracking noise. My sceptical friend\ndeclared he had had enough, and left abruptly. I remember clearly\nthat the back of my hand was turned towards the wall.\n(K) The small copper plate I held had been brought by me to\nrepeat some hypnotic experiment with the mediumistic boy C. Before\n\u2022having been hit I had left it lying about on several places. On being\n\fMAY, 1907. Report of a \" Poltergeist \" Case. 75\nhit it struck me that many of the flying objects had dropped near\nit, and that on its being held in my hand my hand had been\nstruck. I then laid it on the smithy, and in a very short time\nan iron piece flew with a thundering noise against the corrugated\niron roof of the smithy. I gave it to one of the boys to hold, and\nsomething dropped quite near him.\n(L) On this becoming known, a neighbour came in and asked to\nhave a try. He stood opposite me, leaning against the turning lathe,\nwith his back against the wall ; nobody was behind him, nor could\nany one have been. He was struck in the back by a handle off the\nlathe. All these phenomena happened within about ten minutes.\nIt is very unfortunate that I could not continue these curious\nexperiments on that day, as it was closing time, and I had to leave\nshortly afterwards.\nI will now relate two cases, which had happened in my absence,\nbut which left abnormal traces. The first I spoke of in my first\nletter. (A) A canister, containing some plaster of Paris, was\nreported to have jumped on to the ceiling; if I remember right,\nthey said that it had happened during the night. The mark left\nby the clay on the black ceiling had the shape of a comet, a dense\nround head and a widening tail. The mark was very close to the\ndoor, and looked as if it could only have been caused by the\ncanister being thrown from the outside at a very obtuse angle.\nThe canister usually stood almost perpendicularly below, though a\nlittle to the right of the mark. The mark had furthermore the\nparticularity of being formed of perfectly round small spots; I think\nif it had been thrown up, the clay spreading along the ceiling would\nhave made strokes instead of spots. I mentioned this matter to\nsome journalists who were present; but they evidently wanted only\n\" to expose,\" and took no interest in what might prove to be a\nthing worth investigating. On returning after the dinner-hour I was\npresent when Z. and the boys left, though I did not watch them,\nand also when the shop was re-opened. I noticed at once that the\nwhite mark had changed its shape [being now composed of a number\nof short strokes or lines1]. I could not ascertain whether any\ncurrents of air might have blown the clay particles along, thus\ncausing the altered formation.\n(M) In the course of the first month almost all the window panes\nand also the panes of the inner door (the outer one was of plain\nwood) had been smashed, as Z. said, mostly at night ; above the\n1 The sketches illustrating this are not reproduced here.\n\f76 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1907.\ndouble door there was a double glass window. After a noisy night\nI was shown that two of these double panes had holes in them\nthat had not been noticed before. These two holes were quite near\nthe top and both exactly at the same height. If any one had tried\nto produce this effect by throwing with his hand, he would have had\nto stand on the bench in an uncomfortable position, and it seems\ndoubtful whether he could have employed the force necessary to\nknock two round holes out of the two panes in a horizontal line.\nZ. and his apprentices told me of innumerable phenomena which\nhad happened during the two months, and many incidents were con\nfirmed by witnesses. I did not know any one of them personally\nbefore ; they were for the most part workmen or ignorant persons,\ntheir tales varying frequently, so that, I fear, no serious importance\ncan be attached to them. I will, however, mention some of the\nmore remarkable occurrences. Water was poured over Z. and the\nboys while they were working, drenching them thoroughly ; the\nwater did not come from the pail which usually stands near\nthe smithy, as it was full after the drenching, and the tap is a.\nconsiderable distance from the shop. Ink was poured over Z. and\none of the boys, spoiling their hats and shirts; the ink came from\na bottle which was kept in the shop ; I saw the spotted hat. Z.'s\nclay pipe disappeared frequently ; often it flew about, from the\nlathe on to the anvil or the work-bench, sometimes breaking,\nsometimes performing several flights ; once it alighted on the lathe\nwithout breaking, then placed itself upright, and by making a little\njump broke its head. Z.'s notebook was reported to have fluttered\nlike a butterfly across the shop and out of the window ; and the\nsame happened with a bundle of notes and bills. The small bits\nof coke which were kept in a wooden box near the smithy for the\nfire kept flying about, often flying after people leaving the shop-\n(this I saw myself several times). This seems to have happened so\noften that Z. felt the loss severely ; he covered the box with a\nwooden lid; as this did not suffice, he put a very heavy piece of\niron on it (I should think it weighed about 50 Ibs.) and immediately\nsaw this rise about a foot and then drop beside the box. Towards-\nthe end of the period mortar flew about from a spot about a yard\nsquare, until the wall became quite bare. It was noticeable that, I\nshould think, about three-fourths of all the phenomena seemed to\ncome from the direction of this wall, the one to the right of the\ndoor (coming in).\nA neighbour reported that he was often disturbed at night by\n\fMAY, 1907. Report of a \" Poltergeist \" Case. 77\nthe noise of objects being thrown about; the shop was not in\nhabited at night, but the neighbour slept in his shop, next door,\nnear the wall of Z.'s shop. The town architects came to examine\nthe place, but found no explanation ; an electrician, who had\nwritten to the paper that the phenomena were due to \" wandering\nelectric currents,\" found nothing, and as he was told that wooden\nobjects, models, clay, etc., flew about, gave up his experiments. An\nofficial of the Home Office held a seance with a journalist and the\ntwo boys. I was told that after several hours objects were heard\nto fly about twice, on the medium wishing aloud that something\nshould fly. I tried a seance with Z., the boys, and some friends of\nmine, each of the latter holding a hand of Z. and the boys and\nforming a circle; but nothing whatever occurred, either with candle\nlight, or with red light, or in the dark. Then I hypnotised the\nmedium, who \"went off\" very quickly, but nothing happened. The\nboy remained for weeks very amenable to all suggestions coming from\nme without having to be hypnotised again. After about a month\nfrom the beginning I advised Z. to send the boy away for a couple\nof weeks; he actually gave him two weeks' leave. During this\ntime another boy was taken, and very few disturbances occurred ;\nbut the [first] boy was expected back on a Monday and the\nSaturday preceding seems to have been one of the severest days.\nAfter both boys had been finally dismissed the whole thing stopped\nas if\u2014to use the well-known simile\u2014the Morse apparatus had been\ntaken off a line.\nIn reply to a number of further questions about the\ndifferent incidents Mr. Warndorfer wrote again :\nELISABETSTRASSE, 23, BADEN BEI WIEN, April 7th, 1907.\n(G) I did not stand just in front of the small picture, but about\na yard and a half to the right and in front of it; I did not see it\nleave its place, but saw it [when it was] about two yards from\nwhere it alighted on the floor. There was nobody near the place\nwhere I had seen it a very short time before, and there was nobody\nin the part of the shop through which it fluttered. The picture\nwas oval and either photographed on to glass or glued on to glass;\nthere was only a thin brass frame round it. I think it would\nbe very difficult, though not impossible, to throw or drop such a\npicture without its breaking.\n(F) It would have been quite possible to take the compasses\n\f78 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1907.\naway and hide them without my noticing it. I had on my arrival\nexamined the objects lying on the bench, but had not watched\nthem. I am certain, however, that the two boys' four hands were\nbusy at the time ; I remember wondering at the time how anybody\ncould earn a living by employing two boys slowly to drill a small\nhole, while competitors did this by machinery, etc. I think it\nimprobable that I should have overlooked a sudden and rather\nvehement movement on the part of one of the boys [i.e. on the\nsupposition that one of them had thrown it at the other].\n(C) In the case where the heavy iron piece dropped on to my\nhat, I stood in the [middle of the room] with nobody behind me.\nI do not know where the piece came from, but think that I had\nseen it cut off a hot bar of iron some time before; if it was\nthe same, it would have had to rise from the floor.\n(B) It is possible [as you suggest] that somebody might have\nthrown the nut (part of a screw) through the window without my\nnoticing it, but I think it unlikely that it would have rebounded ;\nthe lower, walled part of the smithy is pretty well covered by the\nanvil, and above this is the level part and then the iron roof.\nThe latter projects, as you rightly suppose, into the shop; it was\nstruck very often, sometimes inside, sometimes on the outside,\nalways of course making a very loud and startling noise; when\nstruck on the inside, the striking object usually fell into the fire\nplace. I never saw this when there was a fire.\n(J) I don't think that the object that hit the back of my hand\ncuiild have rebounded [from the bellows] in fact, I feel sure it could\nnot. To my right was the big bellows of the smithy ; anything\nhitting it first would have made a loud noise. I was struck with\ngreat force, and the object, a big nut, weighed, if I remember\nright, more than the piece I sent you. I think it impossible that\nthe shock could have been produced by the nut rebounding from\nthe leather bellows. I consider this case and the one where I was\nstruck under my jacket as the most difficult of explanation.\n(K) I do not remember whether the piece of iron struck against\nthe inside or outside of the roof; this roof slants upward to close\nto the ceiling. I will try and make you a sketch of the shop from\nmemory, perhaps it will give you a clearer idea.\n(L) The man was struck by a small handle, forming part of the\nlathe; the idea at the time was that it had come off the lathe, but\nthe handle was often lying about on the lathe. This handle flew\nabout very often and was said sometimes to have mislaid itself.\n\fMAY, 1907. Report of a \" Poltergeist \" Case. 79\nThe two pieces of iron sent by Mr. Warndorfer are those\nreferred to in the case of the incidents labelled (C) and (I).\nThe first weighs between 2| and 3 oz.; the second rather less\nthan I? oz. The effect of dropping the heavier piece on to the\ntop of one's hat from a height of only an inch or two above\nis to give the head a very perceptible blow. It is perhaps not\nimpossible, however, that the piece of iron was deliberately\nplaced on Mr. Warndorfer's hat a few moments earlier with\nout his noticing it, and that the first touch he felt was caused\nby some movement of his head that displaced it, while a\nfurther movement caused it to drop on the floor.\nCASES.\nL. 1157. Impression.\nThe following is a case in which a sensation of pain was\nproduced, apparently by telepathy. A few experiments in\nthe telepathic transference of pains to hypnotised subjects\nwere recorded in the Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. I. p. 225, and\nVol. II. p. 250; and some in which the subjects were in a\nnormal condition are quoted in Phantasms of the Living,\nVol. I. p. 57, while a spontaneous case of such a transference\nis given in the same volume, p. 188. This one was sent to\nus by Sir Oliver Lodge, who remarks that it comes \" from\na trained experimenter and observer, my assistant, Mr. E. E.\nRobinson.\"\nFERNLEA, WILLOW AVENUE, EDGBASTON, Dec. 16, 1905.\nOn Sunday morning, December 10, 1905, I was in bed thinking\nof nothing in particular. Mrs. R. was dressing. I experienced an\naching pain in my thumb, the kind of pain that would be produced\nby a hole (made by something running in).\nThe pain was so distinct, and the sensation of having a hole in\nthe thumb so real, that I held up my thumb to look for it. I\nfound there was no such hole, and the moment I realized this the\npain went. Almost at the same instant Mrs. R. said to me : \" I\nhave a great difficulty in dressing, my thumb is so painful.\"\nTwo days before she had hurt her thumb by running a nail into\nit. She mentioned the fact to me at the time; as she did not\n\f80 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1907.\nmention it again, the circumstance had been completely forgotten\nby me. I certainly had no idea of it at the time mentioned above.\nE. E. ROBINSON.\nL. 1158. Dream.\nThis case of a telepathic or clairvoyant dream comes from\nan Associate of the Society, Colonel Coghill, who writes :\nCOSHEEN, CASTLE TOWNSHEND, Co. CORK, April 10th [1906].\nThe enclosed case of dream premonition may interest the S.P.R.\nin adding one more instance for the accumulation of cases for\ninvestigation. My nephew, Mr. Penrose, having mentioned the case\nto me, I wrote for a little more information, which, having been\nadded in the form of a statement from the groom, I now beg to\nforward.\nKENDAL COGHILL.\nThe narrative written by Mr. Penrose and signed by the\ngroom is as follows :\nLISMORE, IRELAND.\nOn April 2nd [1906], between 4 a.m. and 5 a.m., Eobert Glynn,\ncoachman to J. Penrose, Esq., woke suddenly, having dreamed that\na mare under his charge had foaled and that he was badly wanted.\nHe immediately dressed and went to the stable, which was about\n20 or 30 yards distant from his house, and found the mare had\njust foaled. The foal was extremely weak, and would undoubtedly\nhave died if he had not come when he did to give it assistance.\nThe mare was 17 days before her time being due to foal\u2014on\nApril 19th. He had not looked at her for two or three days\npreviously, and there were no symptoms of prematurity nor was he\nin any anxiety about the foaling. She had had several foals before\nand had never miscarried before. He did not say anything to his\nwife before going out to the mare, as she was asleep. He had\nbeen in the habit for some days back of getting up early to look\nat a cow that was expected to calve ; but on this occasion the\ndream was so vivid he went straight to the mare's stable as soon\nas he was dressed. He heard no sounds of distress from the mare.\nThe above is exactly according to the facts stated.\n(Signed) EGBERT GLYNN.\n\fNo. CCXL.\u2014VOL. XIII.

Balfour, in the chair.\nDR. T. W. MITCHELL read a paper on \" Experiments on\nthe Appreciation of Time by Somnambules.\"\nAfter expressing his adherence to the view that sub\nconscious cerebral activity in hypnotic somnambules is not\nmerely physiological but has a psychical concomitant co\nexisting with the supraliminal consciousness known to us by\nintrospection during waking life, Dr. Mitchell referred to the\nTime-experiments recorded by Gurney, Delboeuf, and Dr.\nMilne Bramwell. These were devised mainly in order to\neliminate the giving of a fixed date when making suggestions\nof post-hypnotic acts to be fulfilled after a considerable\ninterval. It was pointed out that naming the suggested time-\ninterval as so many days, hours, or minutes, does not ensure\nany continuous time watching, since in all such experiments\nthe subject may make a subconscious calculation so as to\narrive at the terminal time and then fix it in his mind.\n\f84 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1907.\nWhen this calculation has been made, the secondary con\nsciousness is as surely in possession of a fixed date for the\nfulfilment of the post-hypnotic act as if it had been mentioned\nwhen the suggestion was made.\nThe dependence on such calculations was illustrated by\nexperiments carried out on the lines laid down by Gurney,\nDelboeuf and Dr. Bramwell, and especially by some experi\nments in which neither the terminal time nor the \" starting\ntime \" was told to the subject.\nSome experiments were detailed in which an attempt was\nmade to eliminate all possibility of calculating beforehand.\nThe method adopted was to get the subject to tell the\nnumber of hours or minutes that elapsed between the time\nat which the suggestion was made and the giving of a pre\narranged signal\u2014the time at which the signal was to be\ngiven being left undetermined when making the suggestion.\nIn experiments of this kind there seems to be a continuous\ntime-watching, supplemented by counting or additions at regular\nor irregular intervals.\nIn the more theoretical part of his paper Dr. Mitchell\ndealt mainly with the three principal points which Dr.\nBramwell thought demanded explanation in connection with\nhis own experiments. These may be stated briefly as follows ;\n(1) The want of hypnotic memory of the making of the\ncalculations.\n(2) The calculations being beyond the powers of the subject\nin the waking or in the hypnotic state.\n(3) The difference in the nature of the time-appreciation\nrequired when the suggestions were made in minutes\ninstead of in days.\n(1) It was pointed out that although the memory in hypnosis\nof the events of previous hypnoses is, as a rule, very complete,\nwe have no evidence that rehypnotization will enable us to\nrevive in the subject's mind all subliminal mentation that may\nhave occurred during waking life ; and that the absence of\nmemory in hypnosis of the actual making of the calculations is\nno proof that these were not made at the hypnotic level of\nconsciousness.\n(2) Doubt was expressed in regard to the calculations being\nbeyond the ordinary powers of the subject. The points to\n\fJUNE, 1907- Oeneral Meeting. 85\nbe taken into consideration are the training of the hypnotic\nstratum in the course of the experiments, and the accumula\ntion by it of data useful in the making of such calculations ;\nthe length of time at the disposal of the secondary conscious\nness for solving the problems ; the increased concentration of\nattention possible at the hypnotic level ; and some probable\nfacilitation of mental arithmetic at this level which is not\npossible in supraliminal thought.\n(3) It was held that, unless the subject is kept away from all\nordinary means of knowing the time, there is little difference\nin the nature of the sub-conscious time-watching involved,\nwhether the act is to be performed on \"the 39th day from\nthis,\" or \" at 3.45 p.m. a fortnight later.\" The accurate\nfulfilment of acts at a particular moment, previously determined\nby sub-conscious calculation, is related to true time-appreciation\nonly when the subject has been for some time previously kept\naway from all external indications of the passage of time.\nSome experiments were detailed concerning true time-\nappreciation of periods varying from one minute to half an\nhour. It was suggested that the results obtained pointed to\nsome form of sub-conscious counting, in which a correlation\nwas established between our artificial divisions of time and\ncertain rhythmic organic processes which are liable to only\nslight variations of regularity. It was admitted, however, that\nno hypothesis that had up to the present been put forward\nwas sufficient to explain all the facts.\nDR. LLOYD TUCKEY remarked that he was very glad to hear\nreference made again to the hypnotic experiments of Mr.\nGurney, which he regarded as among the most careful and\ntrustworthy that had ever been performed. He himself was\ninclined to think that the appreciation of time by somnambules\nwas a kind of instinctive faculty, akin to the homing instinct\nof animals. The fact that a similar faculty is sometimes\nfound in feeble-minded or almost imbecile persons shows that\nit is no sign of special intelligence. He thought it very probable\nthat, as Dr. Mitchell had suggested, estimation of time might\nin some cases be done by counting the number of respira\ntions or heart-beats. Any such process would be facilitated\nby hypnotism, by which all the subliminal faculties tend to\nbe exalted.\n\f86 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNK, 1907.\nMR. CONSTABLE enquired whether during the short time\nexperiments, Dr. Mitchell had kept his mind fixed on the\ntime, or looked at his watch, so as to know when the fulfil\nment was due ; or was any one present who did this. If\nso, the subject might perhaps have learued telepathically when\nto fulfil the suggestion.\nMR. CALDERON suggested that the somnambule's appreciation\nof time might be analogous to that of the musician, and asked\nwhether experiments, such as altering clocks, had been tried to\nsee whether the somnambule could be misled.\nMK. WARD asked whether Dr. Mitchell had found any\nlimit as to the number of suggestions that could be carried\nout during a certain period of time. If more than a certain\nnumber were given during the same period, did the subject\nbecome confused and make mistakes ?\nDR. MITCHELL, in reply to these questions, said that in\ntesting for accuracy in the estimation of short time-intervals\nhe, in most of the experiments, looked at his watch when\nmaking the suggestion, but did not look at it again until the\nsuggested act had been performed. He had found nothing\nto lead him to -suppose that thought-transference had anything\nto do with the accuracy of the results. The possibility of\nmisleading the subject by altering the clocks which he most\nfrequently sees is difficult to determine, because of the objec\ntion to disorganising other people's households for the sake\nof the experiments. In connection with the appreciation of\nshort time intervals, he had not found that altering the clocks\nhad made any difference in the results. He thought that\nthe limit to the number of experiments involving calculation\nwhich could run concurrently without producing confusion\nhad been reached with his subject, as on one occasion the\nact was performed at the wrong time, although the correct\ntime for its fulfilment had been previously determined by the\nsubject. She attributed her mistake to the fact that she had\nhad so many suggestions to fulfil that she had become\nconfused.\nTHE PRESIDENT said he thought the thanks of the Society\nwere due to Dr. Mitchell for the valuable and suggestive\npaper just read. He believed that by following such lines\nreal advance would be made in the study and elucidation of\n\fJUNE, 1907. General Meeting. 87\nthe complex nature of human personality. What had specially\ninterested him in the description of the experiments was the\nindication they afforded not only of the existence of one\nsubliminal region of consciousness\u2014such as was now generally\nrecognised\u2014'mt that within this region a number of more\nor less separate strata of consciousness or psychic centres\nwere contained.\nVISION CUBING A STATE OF COMA.\nTHIS case has a resemblance to the vision of Dr. Wiltse, in\nProceedings, Vol. VIII. p. 180 (quoted in Human Personality,\nVol. II. p. 315), and is still more interesting in that, if the\nstatements given are to be implicitly trusted, the patient had\nduring his trance condition telepathic impressions of a marked\nkind which he afterwards carefully verified. The remoteness\nof the events makes it impossible to obtain any corroboration,\nand therefore prevents the case from attaining the evidential\nstandard which we are accustomed to require. But the record\nappears to have been made with so much care and scrupulosity\nthat it seems worth quoting, and it is indeed, from the\npsychological point of view alone, of considerable interest.\nFor the account we are indebted to Mr. J. W. Graham,\nof Dalton Hall, Victoria Park, Manchester, who obtained from\nAmerica the book containing it\u2014a very rare one\u2014and has\ntaken the trouble to copy the narrative verbatim from it.\nThe book is entitled : \" A Short Compilation of the extra\nordinary Life and Writings of Thomas Say, in which is\nfaithfully copied, from the original manuscript, ' the Uncommon\nVision' which he had when a young man. By his son.\nPhila., 1796.\"\nThe above book [says Mr. Graham] tells us that Thomas Say was\nborn in Philadelphia, 16. ix. 1709 (old style). His grandfather and\nhis mother came from England with Wm. Penn ; but he was brought\nup an Anglican and joined Friends by convincetnent against the\nwish of his relations. He was apprentice to his uncle, Wm.\nRobinson, a saddler, and was \" about the age of sixteen or\nseventeen \" when he had a bad attack of pleurisy. He was at\nthe time in great spiritual distress, doubting the existence of God\nand of immortality, and of the soul, and yet half afraid of hell if\n\f88 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNK, 1907.\nhis illness proved fatal. This spiritual unrest had been the great\ntrouble of his life before his illness. I now quote : (copying from\nthe rare book before me, p. 66)\n\" On the ninth day, between the hours of 4 and 5, I fell into\na trance, and so continued till about the hour of three or four the\nnext morning. After my departure from the body (for I left the\nbody), my father and mother, Susannah Robinson and others who\nwatched me, shook my body, felt for my pulse, and tried if they\ncould discern any remains of life or breath in me ; but found\nnone. Some may be desirous to know whether I was laid out\nor not; I found myself, when I opened my eyes, laid on my back\nin my bed as a corpse is on a board ; and I was told after I got\nbetter, the reason why they did not lay me on a board was,\nbecause my mother could not, at that time, find freedom to have\nit done ; then they sent for Dr. Kearsley, who attended me, to\nhave his opinion. When he came he felt for my pulse and found\nnone, nor any remains of life in me, as he told them; but as he\nwas going away, he returned again and said that something came\ninto his mind to try further ; he then desired somebody to get\nhim a small looking-glass, which Catharine Souder, who lived with\nmy father, procured ; the Doctor laid it on my mouth for a short\ntime, then took it off, and there appeared on the glass a little\nmoisture, then the Doctor said to them, If he is not dead I\nbelieve he is so far gone that I think he will never open his eyes\nagain ; but I would have you let him lay while he continues\nwarm, and when he begins to grow cold lay him out.\n\"This they' told me when I returned into the body, at which\ntime I inquired why so many sat up with me, not knowing that they\nthought me dead. Upon hearing me speak, they were all very\nmuch surprised ; the second time I spoke they all rose out of their\nchairs, and when I spoke the third time they all came to me. My\nfather and mother inquired how it had been with me. I answered\nand said unto them, I thought I had been dead and going to\nheaven ; and after I left the body, I heard as it were the voices\nof men, women and children singing songs of praises unto the\nLord God and the Lamb, without intermission, which ravished my\nsoul and threw me into transports of joy. My soul was also\ndelighted with most beautiful greens which appeared to me on\nevery side, and such as never were seen in this world ; through\nthese I passed, being all clothed in white, and in my full shape\nwithout the least diminution of parts. As I passed along towards\n\fJUNK, 1907. Vision during a State of Coma. 89\na higher state of bliss, I cast my eyes upon the earth which I saw\nplainly, and beheld three men (whom I knew) die. Two of them\nwere white men, one of whom entered into rest, and the other\nwas cast off. There appeared a beautiful transparent gate opened,\nand as I and the one that entered into rest came up to it he\nstepped in ; but as I was stepping in I stepped into the body.\nWhen I recovered from my trance, I mentioned both their names,\nat the same time telling how I saw them die, and which of them\nentered into rest and which did not. I said to my mother, 0 that\nI had made one step further; then I should not have come back\nagain. After I told them what I had to say, I desired them to\nsay no more to me, for I still heard the melodious songs of praises,\nand while I heard them I felt no pain ; but when they went from\nme, the pain in my side returned again; for which I was glad,\nhoping every stitch would take me off and longing for my final\nchange. After I told them of the death of the three men, they\nsent to see if it was so, and when the messenger returned he told\nthem they were all dead, and died in the rooms, etc., as I told\nthem ; upon hearing it I fell into tears and said, 0 Lord, I wish\nthou hadst kept me, and sent him back that was in pain ; after\nwhich I soon recovered from my sickness. The third was a negro\nnamed Cuffe, belonging to the widow Kearny, whom I saw die\nin the brick kitchen, and when they were laying him on a board\nhis head fell out of their hands, when about six inches off the\nboard; which I saw plainly with the other circumstances of his\nbeing laid out, etc., for (N.B.) the walls were no hindrance to my\nsight.\" He says he saw \"the negro on his way to happiness, yet\nI was not permitted to see him fully enter into rest : but just as\nI thought myself about to enter into rest, I came into the body\nagain.\n\" Some time after my recovery the widow Kearny, the mistress\nof the negro man, sent for me, and inquired, whether I thought\nthe departed spirits knew one another? I answered in the\naffirmative, and told her, that I saw her negro man die, whilst I\nwas a corpse. She then asked me, Where did he die? I told her\nin her brick kitchen, between the jamb of the chimney and the\nwall, and when they took him off the bed to lay him on the board\nhis head slipped out of their hands ; she then said, so it did ; and\nasked me if I could tell her where they laid him. I informed her\nthat they laid him between the back door and the street door ;\nshe said that she did not remember anything of that; I told her\n\f90 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNB, 1907.\nhe laid there whilst they swept under the window, where he was\nafterwards placed. She then said she remembered it was so, and\ntold me that she was satisfied.\n\" These men, upon inquiry, were found to die at the very time\nI saw them ; and all the circumstances of their death were found\nto be as I related them. As some may be desirous to know how,\nand in what shape those dead appeared to me, I would satisfy\ntheir desire by telling them that they appeared each in a complete\nbody, which I take to be the spiritual body. They were also all\nclothed, the negro and the person who entered into rest in white,\nand the other who was cast off, had his garment somewhat white,\nbut spotted.\"\nThos. Say, whom I have been quoting, was a man greatly honoured\nthrough a long life, actively engaged in the philanthropies of the\nPhiladelphia Friends, a trusted guardian of orphan children, and\ntrustee under many wills. When succouring the French neutrals\nwho had smallpox among them, he fearlessly stuck to his duty,\nwhich led to the loss of his daughter from the disease. After\nsaving money as a saddler he became a chemist and apothecary,\nfor he had a gift of healing and performed many cures, often\ngratuitously to the poor. \"There are a number of well attested\ncases of wens being removed and indolent tumors dispersed in the\nglands of the human body, by stroking his hands over them a few\ntimes.\"\nThe above extracts and summary are of the nature of first-hand\nevidence, being copied with the utmost conscientiousness from the\nmanuscript of the percipient. The whole narrative seems to show\nthat Thomas Say had what we ignorantly call \" psychical \" qualities,\nand the verification of the three deaths gives it value from our\nSociety's point of view.\nDEEAM EOMANCES.\nTHE following narrative suggests points of comparison with\nthe life history of the medium described by Professor Flournoy\nin his book, Des Indes & la plantte Mars, the place of Leopold\nin relation to Helene Smith being here taken by Marie-\nAntoinette, who, it will be remembered, also plays a part in\nthe history of Helene Smith as one of her supposed pre-\nincarnations. The conception of a \" guide \" or \" control \" is\nvery frequent in trance phenomena, but perhaps seldom\n\fJUNE, 3907. Dream Romances. 91\ndevelops so far as in the present case without being accom\npanied by trance or some other form of automatism.\nThe account was sent to us by an Associate of the Society,\nMrs. Stapleton, of 46 Montagu Square, London, W. The\nwriter is, she tells us, a person of strongly developed artistic\nsensibilities, and in particular a remarkably gifted musician.\nThe name was given to us in confidence, and Mrs. Stapleton,\nwho has known her intimately for many years, believes that\nthis report of her experiences is a literally accurate one. It is\nof course probable that the apparently veridical features of the\nvisions were derived from pictures or descriptions seen or heard\nand afterwards forgotten. For a discussion of the not very\nuncommon sensation of previous familiarity with scenes supposed\nto be visited for the first time, see Mr. Myers's article on\n\" Eetrocognition and Precognition \" in Proceedings S.P.R, Vol.\nXI. pp. 332 et seq., especially pp. 341-47.\nI was born in Petersburg, of Eussian parents, though from my\nfather's side of mixed nationality, his mother having been French,\na Parisian. I was a nervous, highly-strung child and up to about\ntwelve years of age suffered from an almost continuous high\ntemperature.\nMy earliest recollections were of a strange nature : every night,\nafter I had been put to bed, I saw the door open and a strange\nwoman come in, who glided up to my bedside and sat down on\na chair, bending over to look at me. She had masses of grey\nhair, done up in a fashion quite unlike to the people I was\naccustomed to see, as was also her dress, of brown colour with\na flowery design, and around her neck and shoulders there was\na white fichu, the ends of which hung down in front. At first\nthis apparition almost threw me into convulsions of terror, which\nwere not lessened by any caresses bestowed upon me, and the\nassurance of my mother and nurse that \" there was no such woman \"\nas I described. I only resented such assurances, for how could I\nnot believe what I saw, palpable, alive, as much so as were the\npeople surrounding me. Everything was tried to break the spell ;\nI was put into a different room, my mother sat upon the chair by\nmy bed trying to soothe me. It was no use ! Just as before,\nnight by night, I saw the figure glide into the room, and the\nchair being occupied, she stood at the other side of the bed, or\nat the foot end, watching me. I was not at all a hysterical child,\n\f92 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1907.\nbut of an equable, patient disposition. I soon understood that\nthe people round me must have some reason either for persuading\nme that what I saw was not real, or else that my nightly visitor\nwas a person not approved of by them, and they hoped to drive\nher away by professing to ignore her. Little by little, also, I\ngrew accustomed to her coming; I even watched for it and grew\nto like it, for my child's instinct told me that this woman was\nmy friend, and had some kindly purpose in watching by my bed\nevery night. Many an evening, when my parents were entertaining\nguests, or had artistes to sing and play, which kept me awake, as\nI loved music, the presence of my unknown friend comforted me.\nShe remained with me for hours, and sometimes put a cool, slender\nhand on my head while she bent down to look into my face.\nI had full leisure to note every detail of her face, which seemed\nto me very beautiful ; her eyes, especially, struck me ; they were\nof a deep blue, and brilliant like stars, though at times the lids\nlooked very heavy, as though she had been crying. She never\nspoke to me, nor I to her, and this seemed natural to me ; I felt\nthat we understood one another.\nAs my people appeared to me so unsympathetic about her, I\nfinished by never mentioning her again, and tried not to betray\neven by a movement when she entered the room. But this only\nhelped to strengthen the secret bond there was between us\u2014or so it\nappeared to me. When I was about six years old an incident took\nplace which threw me into a great agitation. My mother went\nto a fancy dress ball, and I entered her room just as she was\ndressed. I rushed forward with a shout of joy on seeing her : it\nwas the dress of my silent friend ! I may mention here that she\ndid not always appear in the same dress, but sometimes in a very\nbeautiful blue or white one with gold and silver worked all over\nit. My mother wore the dress of the Louis XVI. period. She seemed\nsurprised at my appearing to recognize this dress, which certainly I\ncould never have seen before ; but being very anxious not to\nencourage what she termed my nervous fancy, she tried to make\nlight of it, and not to refer to it again afterwards.\nThus, this apparition visited me daily till I was nearly ten years\nold. Sometimes she also came by day and watched me playing.\nThere was another curious fact of my early childhood : I had a\ngreat fancy for drawing, and being a very reticent, silent child,\nused to amuse myself for hours by inventing stories and illustrating\nthem as I went along. The most natural thing for a child to do\n\f1907. Dream Romances. 93\nis, I suppose, to reproduce what she sees around her. But all\nmy figures wore knee breeches, long coats, buckled shoes, and\nwore their hair gathered at the back with a ribbon ; and the ladies\nhad enormous mountains of hair upon their heads, and wore dresses\nof the Louis XVI. period. Yet I had never seen any pictures of\nthis period. These drawings so astonished an artist friend of ours,\nthat he begged leave to show them to the President of the Academy\nof Arts. No one could understand where I got these pictures from,\nnor could I explain when asked. I only knew it came natural\nto me.\nI had an aunt, who was very fond of me, and encouraged me\nto tell her all my strange fancies. One day I overheard her say\ning to my mother : \" There is something mysterious about that\nchild, she does not seem to belong to any of us, it is as if she\nwere of a different race.\" Indeed, it is a strange fact that I never\nfelt any of the intimate blood-ties that generally exist between\nmembers of the same family. In my later childhood I was even\nreproached with this want of feeling, I was told that I had no\nesprit de corps.\nAfter I had reached the age of ten, my apparition ceased to\ncome to me regularly\u2014her visits became less and less frequent,\nand at last stopped altogether.\nWhen I was taught history I most liked and was interested in\nthe life of Marie-Antoinette. I loved the very sound of her name,\nand shed tears over her tragic fate.\nOf course, every child, and even most grown-up people, may have\na special sympathy for some figure in history, but mine was more\nthan an ordinary sympathy, it was a cult, an obsession. I spent\nhours at the South Kensington Museum gazing at Marie-Antoinette's\nbust, examining her toilet-table with its little rouge pots, etc. I\ncan honestly say that my happiest hours were spent in contemplating\nthese treasures, though it was always with an emotion bordering\n\u2022on tears that I faced the bust of the queen.\nHowever, life went on, I became very active, had many various\ninterests, and the image of the queen faded a little out of my\nbusy life; though when I did think of her, it was with an extra\nordinary affection ; I felt that she was dearer to me than any\none in the world. 1 very frequently dreamed of her, and though my\ndreams generally were very disconnected and intangible, whenever I\n\u2022dreamt of her it was in a most logical sequence, and, contrary to\nmost dreams, I remembered every detail of it in the morning.\n\f94 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1907.\nThese dreams represented a routine of daily life at some palace\u2014\nalways the same palace\u2014but one I had never seen in reality.\nAbout five years ago I was staying in a doctor's family at\nMargate. We were a very cheery party, and there certainly was\nnothing to suggest \"ghosts\" in the house. One day, however,\non entering my be1lroom, I saw the same figure\u2014Marie-Antoinette\u2014\nstanding by a small, rough deal table (there was no such table\nin my room) ; she supported herself with one hand against this\ntable and looked up at me as I entered. It was the same face,\nyet a horrible change had taken place : it looked haggard and\nagonized, and her eyes, no longer radiant, fixed me with a strange,\nglassy look. Her hair, almost white, was parted in the centre,\nand it was flat now, not as she wore it before. This time I could\nnot restrain myself, I rushed forward with a sob, and, extending\nmy arms, gasped : \" Marie-Antoinette ! \" But as I moved the\napparition was gone. A year after this I went to Paris for the\nfirst time, and among other places, went to the Musee Grevin. I\nreceived a real shock on seeing there the exact reproduction of\nmy vision at Margate, with every detail. It represented the\nQueen at the Conciergerie, only the wax face was unlike the one\nI had seen ; it did not express any of the agony I noticed. My\nfriends who were with me laughed at my \" fancy,\" and indeed I have\nlearnt to be very reticent about my strange experiences, as I feel I\nwould only meet with ridicule or scepticism were I to talk about them.\nAfter this incident there was a period of constant dreams : the\nsame palace or else a park; Marie-Antoinette playing billiards; Marie-\nAntoinette playing cards with Louis XVI., Madame Elizabeth and\nmyself; my playing on a spinet in a salon full of people, and\nMarie-Antoinette standing near, signing to the crowd to be silent,\nand so on. The odd part about these dreams was that I always\nsaw myself in them as a boy, never as a girl.\nThis last summer I was staying at a small village not far from\nVersailles. The country of that part ought to have appeared quite\nnew to me, as I had never been on the outskirts of Paris. But\nwherever I walked, St. Cloud, Marly, Versailles, I was haunted\nby the sensation that I had looked on all this scenery before. The\nvery first time I went to Versailles I was accompanied by a servant\nwho had to do her shopping there. When she had done all her\ncommissions I suggested our looking at the Palace. When we got\nthere the place was already shut. We walked round the outside\nof the palace, and, though I had not seen any plan of it, I found\n\fJUNE, 1907. Dream Romances. 95\nmyself pointing out to the servant where used to be the king's\napartments, where the queen's, etc. She asked me whether I knew\nthe palace well. \" Oh, no,\" I said, \" I have never been here before,\nand I don't know how I know all this, but I know ! \" In walking\nthrough the park the place was so familiar to me and seemed so\nfull of some vague memories which no sooner I seemed to elucidate\nthan the}' evaded me, that I trembled from emotion, feeling a\nhorrible choking sensation at my throat.\nThe next day our whole party went to see the Palace. One of\nus had a guide book, but as I never refer to them before having\nseen a place, finding it only confusing, I really knew less than\nany of my friends what we were going to see. The first thing I\nverified on entering was that I had perfectly correctly located\nthe different wings of apartments inhabited formerly by Louis\nXVI. and Marie-Antoinette. We wandered through endless suites\nof rooms, all more or less alike, and as nothing was written up\nanywhere to indicate any special room, it was impossible to find\nout anything except from the guide book. However, before my\nfriends had been able to form any idea from the guide book, I\nstopped them in one particular room, seized by that same choking\nemotion as the day before, and I went straight to a little door\nwhich, being in a panel of the wall, would be hardly noticeable\nto any one not knowing it was there. \"There are rooms beyond, I\nmust go in there ! \" I said. Just then one of the guides came up\nto us: \"Do you wish to see the petits appartements de Marie-\nAntoinette?\" and he unlocked the door for us. My friends were\nperfectly astounded at my knowledge of the place, and I found\nmyself acting as guide to them better than the official guide, who\nonly shows the public what is catalogued in the book, whereas I\nfound doors leading to passages, leading to other rooms, without\nbeing able to explain how I knew. Even the guide was astonished,\nand thought I must have made extensive historical researches !\nThe place was just as I knew, as I expected it to be, and yet\nvery much changed. I believe if I were left alone in those rooms\nand had my eyes shut, I could reconstruct on paper the exact\ndisposition of the rooms as they were formerly furnished. Trianon\nseemed to me even more familiar, though I missed a great many\nobjects which I fancied should be there. The music room was the\nidentical one I had seen in my dream when playing before the\nqueen, only the chairs ought to have been placed in a different\nposition. One other curious fact in connection with Trianon is\n\f96 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1907.\nthis : I had often designed the monogram \" M.A. \" underneath\nportraits of Marie-Antoinette, and as every one will see, there\nare many different ways [in which] this monogram can be drawn.\nBut my monogram was always the same, and I found it to be the\nfacsimile of the iron-wrought monogram on the staircase at Trianon.\nBut what disturbed me frightfully in seeing Trianon is the crowd\namong which one is driven through the apartments by the guide.\nI feel almost certain that if I could pass a day or a night alone in\nthose apartments, I should see people and scenes which have passed\nthere before.\nOf course many people have the sensation, on seeing a new place\nfor the first time, that they have seen it before. There may even\nbe a simple scientific explanation for this. But I not only remember\nthese places, but before turning a corner I can tell what is beyond\nin absolute detail. For instance, of the Chateau at Marly little\nremains but ruins, and no guide book makes even mention of it.\nOn going there for the first time I described to a friend what we\nshould find around a bend in the road, and this was quite accurate.\nIn Paris itself I found less that seemed familiar to me, except\nthat I can never pass through the Rue St. Honore without a cold\nshudder down my back, and nothing could induce me to walk\nover a certain spot on the Place de la Concorde,\u2014I always describe\na circle round it, and have a horrible sensation of fear and horror\nof the entire square.\nOne night, while sleeping at a hotel at the corner of the Rue\nSt. Honore', I had a horrible nightmare. I heard the savage howling\nof a mob, and on looking out of the window saw Marie-Antoinette\npass in the tumbril, and myself in the crowd, struggling frantically\nto push my way through and shouting incessantly : \" The queen !\nLet me get to the queen ! I must get to the queen ! \" And\nagain I was under the scaffold, stabbing furiously at the legs of\nthe executioner to prevent him from doing his gruesome work, while\nthe crowd jostled me back. Then I gave a horrible shriek . . .\nand that was the end of my dream. While staying near Versailles\nI several times saw Marie-Antoinette sit on a chair by my bed,\nand even a fortnight ago, now I am in England, I saw her sitting\nin a dejected attitude at my writing-desk in broad daylight. The\nvision lasted only some seconds.\nI have tried to find some explanation, some solution to this mystery\nwhich has haunted me since my earliest childhood, but there seems\nno plausible explanation. I seemed on the point of reconstructing\na consecutive remembrance of some former existence while in France,\nbut no sooner do I seem to hold the thread [than] I lose it, which\nis a very painful sensation. But I have not yet lost hope that, on\nreturning to France, I shall get nearer the solution of this haunting\nmystery.\n\fNo. CCXLL\u2014VOL. XIII.

This lady did not\nwish her name to be published, and was therefore referred to\n\fJULY, 1907. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 99\nhere as \" Mrs. Holland.\" She had been accustomed to send Miss\nJohnson all the originals of her script from September 1903\nonwards, together with notes of the books she had read or\nfacts normally known to her which might throw light on\nstatements made in the script. A large number of passages\nin it had been with her help traced to subliminal reminiscences\n\u2014sometimes appearing in an oddly distorted form\u2014of what\nshe had heard or read ; and some instances of this were given.\nBut there was also a fair proportion of evidential matter.\nThe evidential incidents quoted on this occasion were : cases\nof apparent telepathy between Mrs. Holland and Mrs. Verrall,\n(who were unknown to each other when the first cases\noccurred) ; and correspondences between statements given in\ntheir automatic scripts independently of one another. Thus,\non one occasion, Mrs. Holland's script gave a detailed descrip\ntion of a room, which Mrs. Verrall identified later as her\ndining room. On another occasion, when Miss Johnson had\narranged for the two automatists, who were then in different parts\nof England, to write once a week on the same day and send\ntheir writings to her to be compared, Mrs. Verrall's script\nstated that a photograph of Carpaccio's St. Ursula was hanging\nin Mrs. Holland's room. This was not the case, but on the\nevening before Mrs. Verrall wrote, Mrs. Holland had been looking\nthrough a portfolio of \" Great Masters \" and had been specially\nattracted by a reproduction of Garpaccio's St. Ursula: so much\nso that her father had asked her if she would like to have it\nframed to hang in her room.\nIn other cases connections of a complicated and indirect\nkind had occurred between the scripts of Mrs. Verrall and\nMrs. Holland. Mr. Piddington had first pointed out the\nspecial interest and importance of what he called \" cross-\ncorrespondences \" between the independent utterances of two\nmediums, in his paper on the phenomena of Mrs. Thompson's\ntrance (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XVIII., pp. 294-307); and\nsome striking cases that had occurred between Mrs. Verrall\nand Mrs. Forbes were given in Mrs. Verrall's report on her\nautomatic writing (Proceedings, Vol. XX.). The characteristic\npoint in what may be called the most advanced type of these\ncases is that we do not get in the writing of one scribe\neither a verbatim reproduction of phrases in the other, or\n\f100 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1907.\nthe same idea expressed in different ways ; both of which\nmight result from direct telepathy between them. What\nwe get is a fragmentary utterance in one, which seems to\nhave no particular point, and another fragmentary utterance\nin the other, equally pointless ; but when the two utterances\nare put together, they are seen to supplement one another,\nand it appears that there is one definite and coherent idea\nunderlying both, but only partially expressed in each.\nMiss Johnson suggested that by this means it might be\npossible to obtain evidence more conclusive than any obtained\nhitherto of the action of a third intelligence external to the\nminds of both the automatists ; since it is not easy to\nsuppose that a simple telepathic perception by one of them\nof a fragment in the writing of the other could lead to the\nproduction of a second fragment which can only after careful\ncomparison be seen to be related to the first. Such a case\nsuggests that a third intelligence is telepathically impressing\nthe two fragments respectively on them, and this intelligence\nmay be\u2014as, in some of the cases referred to, it purports to be\n\u2014that of a deceased person.\nHitherto evidence for survival has mainly depended on\nstatements that seem to show the \" control's \" recollection of\nincidents in his past life. Telepathy relating to the present,\nsuch as we can get between living persons, would be more\nsatisfactory evidentially than telepathy relating to the past,\nsince it is much easier to exclude normal knowledge of events\nin the present than in the past. These \"cross-correspon\ndences\" are perhaps a means of getting evidence of this\nstronger type for telepathy from the dead ; for they suggest\nan independent invention, an active intelligence, constantly\nat work in the present, not a mere echo or remnant of\nindividualities of the past.\nMiss Johnson observed that the instances just brought\nforward were obviously far from sufficient to prove any such\nagency. It was clear that most of Mrs. Holland's script\nrepresented merely the workings of her own subliminal mind.\nThere was evidence also of direct telepathy between her\nmind and the minds of other living persons. But there\nwere also indications, as Miss Johnson thought would appear\nwhen the full report of the case was published, of telepathy\n\fJULY, 1907. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 101\nbetween her mind and the minds \u00abif persons who were once\nliving, and who\u2014it may be\u2014live stiR,\",.\nSIR OLIVER LODGE remarked that the\" cross-correspondences\ndescribed represented what was to his mind a very important\nnew type of evidence. The instances quoted \"b\"y Miss Johnson\nwere, of course, as she had said, far from conclusive in them\nselves ; but they were to be regarded as samples , of the\nevidence obtained from several different automatists' which had\nbeen accumulating during the last few years, and whicfh\" he\nhoped it would before long be possible to present to the Society.\nHe did not know if members fully realised the difficulty *o\u00a3\"\nproving the survival of personal identity. Communications\npurporting to come from a named person and containing plenty\nof intelligence appropriate to that person were by no means\nsufficient, in face of the elastic hypotheses of telepathy and\nclairvoyance. But by this device of cross-correspondence\u2014that\nis to say, the splitting up of a communication into fragments,\neach of them unintelligible without its context, and then\ngiving the fragments through several different automatists,\nsomething like a scientific proof of survival of intelligence\nmay ultimately be possible. The difficulties are great, and\nmuch patience is required on both sides ; but it appears as\nif something on those lines was being actually attempted.\nThose who had listened to the paper that afternoon would be\nable to form some conception of the amount of labour and\ntime that it was necessary to spend in studying and compar\ning these scripts before the full significance of them could be\ndetermined ; and it was probable that a still longer study\nmight reveal other connections that were now obscure. It\nwas on this account that it appeared best not to hurry the\npublication of the reports. If, as he hoped, a more complete,\ncritical and accurate study of the whole evidence should result\nin establishing on a firm and scientific basis some theories\nwhich at present could only be regarded as conjectural, the\ndelay would be more than justified.\nMR. F. C. CONSTABLE, in connection with the theory of\n\" cross-correspondences \" suggested by Miss Johnson, referred to\na case described in Mrs. Verrall's report (Proceedings, Vol. XX.\npp. 213-217). Here Dr. Hodgson, during a sitting with Mrs.\nPiper, had asked a \" control \" to appear to Miss Verrall with\n\f102 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1907.\na spear in his hand. The .control asked, \" Why a sphere ? \"\nand Dr. Hodgson repeated .\" spear. \" At the next sitting the\ncontrol said he had \"made himself visible with a \" sphear \"\n{sic). A passage, in \"-Mrs. Verrall's script, written between the\ndates of these. .tV.b- sittings, referred to the seeing of a sphere\nand to a .spear, ''thus giving separately the two notions which\nhad appeared in a confused state of amalgamation in Mrs.\nPiperX.lscl-ipt. In this case, it would seem that there could\nhardly-.tiave been any direct transference of ideas from Mrs.\n-Piker's to Mrs. Verrall's mind, unless we suppose that the\n\u2022 Tne'aningless word \"sphear\" was transferred, and that its two\nconstituents emerged separately in Mrs. Verrall's mind. The\nincident pointed rather, in the opinion of the speaker, to the\nintervention of some third intelligence.\nMR. Fox PITT suggested that in investigations of this kind\nit was important to ascertain what were the preconceived ideas\nof the automatist and those associated in the experiment. If\nthey had a bias towards belief in the survival of personality,\nthe script would probably be influenced by this. The cases\ngiven that afternoon might be regarded as showing primarily\nthat the subliminal faculties greatly transcended those of the\nsupraliminal. He believed that the conception of separate and\npermanent individual entities was a crude notion of merely\ntemporary material conditions, and that the supernormal faculties\nof the subliminal self indicated that it was not an isolated\nentity, but the psychical potentiality of one individual in its\nrelation to all other subliminal selves.\nMR. A. T. FRYER said that he considered the instances\nquoted by Miss Johnson suggested nothing at all beyond\ntelepathy from living persons. He pointed out that one case\ncould be explained by telepathy from Dr. Verrall, who had\nbeen thinking of the topic that turned up in Mrs. Holland's\nscript ; and that in the other cases it might be supposed that\nMiss Johnson herself had acted as a telepathic medium between\nMrs. Verrall and Mrs. Holland.\nMiss JOHNSON replied that in that case it would have to\nbe supposed that she had telepathically transmitted ideas of\nwhich she had no normal or conscious knowledge, since she\nwas unaware of the contents of both scripts until some time\nafter they were written.\n\fJULY, 1907. Case. 103\nCASE.\nL. 1159. Collective Apparition.\nIN Mr. Myers's Human Personality (Vol. II., pp. 42-45)\nreference is made to a number of cases where apparitions\nwere seen at or about the time of death, the dying person\nhaving arranged beforehand that he would, if possible, appear\nto some friend after his death. These are followed by a\nremarkable case (op. cit. p. 45) where a choirmaster sees in\nhis own house the apparition of one of his singers who had\ndied suddenly from a stroke of apoplexy two or three hours\nbefore. The man was to have gone to his house for a choir\npractice on the following evening, and it was supposed that\nthe thought of this engagement might have been in his mind\njust before he died. Somewhat similarly in the case here\ngiven the apparition of a man is seen in a place where the\nman himself would have been, had he lived to carry out an\nengagement made probably the day before.\nThe first account of this case appeared in The Annals of\nPsychical Science, for January, 1907, and is quoted thence\nby the kind permission of the Editor.\nI had been staying for the fishing in a little inn in the North of\nScotland for some three months this year (1906) and my visit\nwas just drawing to a close with the end of the trout season when\nthe circumstances of this story took place.\nThe fishing at this spot consists in a series of four lochs linked\ntogether by a narrow stream, barely 15ft. in width, so that the\nlochs form a sort of chain. This stream runs along by the side\nof the coach road past the inn for some two miles, when it\nbranches off to the left and follows a little lane leading to the\nonly Highland village of the district, lying three miles from the\njunction of the lane and the coach road. It is from this village\nthat the ghillies or boatmen are obtained, and their custom is to\ncome each morning as required from the village to the inn to\ntake the anglers out on the lochs. After the day's sport is over\nthey walk home to the village, often in the dark of the early\nScotch evening.\nSeptember had arrived and beside myself there were few anglers\nleft at the inn : Mr. H., who had been fishing there for three\nweeks and knew the locality and the inhabitants well, an old\n\f104 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1907.\ngentleman and his wife who had arrived the night before the\noccurrence, and one or two more who are not in any way con\nnected with the story.\nThe elderly gentleman, whom I have mentioned and whom we\nwill call Mr. B., was accustomed to have one particular ghillie,\nnamed James, and consequently, on the night of their arrival, this\nboatman, a man of 55 or 56 years of age, and well known to both\nMr. H. and me, came down to the inn to hear what the plans\nfor the morrow might be.\nThe pipes were played that night, and the old ghillie delayed\nhis departure till a late hour, listening to the music, and it was\n9 o'clock (and a pitch dark night) before he left for home. He\nwas accompanied for some distance by a lad of about 18, but ab\nthe cross roads they parted and James went on alone. He never\narrived home that night, and the two old sisters, with whom he\nlived, sat up all through the night, anxiously expecting his knock,\nthough this we did not learn until the following evening.\nThat next morning Mr. H. and I were to fish at a loch together,\nand Mr. H., coming out after breakfast, saw old James standing\nin his accustomed place on the road. A little later both Mr.'H.\nand I saw the man bending down by one of the boats tied to\nthe little jetty that runs into the loch in front of the inn. We\nboth knew [the man so well that we could have made no mistake\nand we were so close to him that I personally gave him a morning\ngreeting, though I received no answer.\nMr. H. said to me : \"I wonder who it is old James is going to\nghillie?\" I heard this question but did not answer it, and it was\nalso heard by Mr. B.'s wife from her bedroom window.\nLater in the day, while fishing on the loch, Mr. H. again\nasked: \"Who is old James ghillying?\" and I then answered: \"It-\nmust be for the old gentleman who came last night.\" Our fish\ning over, we returned to the inn and Mr. H. went straight up to\nhis bedroom to change. I was removing my boots when Kate,\nthe waitress, came up to me and said :\n\" Poor old James has gone astray, Captain.\"\n\" Nonsense,\" I said, \" he was here only this morning, I saw\nhim.\"\nThe maid answered that it was quite impossible, as he had not\narrived home the night before and his sisters were in a great state\nof anxiety about him.\nI immediately went up to Mr. H.'s room and simply said : \" Old\n\fJULY, 1907. Case. 105-\nJames is lost.\" Mr. H. answered : \" That is very extraordinary, I\nsaw him here this morning.\"\nI then went down and told my host of the inn that both H.\nand I had seen James that morning, but he said the thing\nwas impossible, as the other ghillies were along the road and\nstanding in front of the hotel at that time, and knowing that\nJames was missing they were on the look-out for him, and could\nnot have failed to see him. Moreover he said that James was a\nmost reliable man, who never failed to turn up when required and\nalways went home at nights.\nGhillies and crofters were searching all that night for the missing,\nman, thinking that he might have got lost on the moors, or stuck\nin a peat-bog, but beyond his handkerchief, which was discovered\nsome way from the cross-roads, no trace could be found. The\nfollowing morning operations were commenced for dragging the\ndeep pools along the stream and we found the poor old man\nlying in the water a mile and a half from the cross roads, face\ndownwards. He had evidently lost the road in the dark and\nfallen face foremost into the stream. It was clear that he had\nbeen in the water for some thirty-six hours and that it was on\nthat dark night, when he left the inn at 9 o'clock, that he met\nhis death. So that when H. and I saw him, or thought that we\nsaw him, he was in reality dead.\nNow both H. and I were, and still are, prepared to swear that\nwe saw James, or the \"spirit\" of James, standing outside the inn\non that September morning, though the figure was unobserved by\nany other of those standing there, and I should mention that\nwhen we saw James we also saw the other ghillies, both our own\nand those belonging to other anglers, waiting for the start, and\nthese men we saw in close proximity to the dead ghillie. At the\ntime, as I have mentioned before, we did not know that he was\nmissing or that he had not returned home the night before, though\nthis fact was known to the ghillies. They did not tell us during\nthe day, but those who know the Celt know what a reticent and\nuncommunicative individual he can be. Moreover, H.'s comments\nduring the day, which were heard by me and by Mrs. B., show\nclearly that he had noticed James standing in waiting and had\npaid particular attention to the fact, as he wondered by whom\nhe was to be employed, and our separate answers to the report\nin the evening that the man had gone astray are ample proof\nthat we were unaffected by what the other said. . . .\n\f106 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1907.\nWhether this appearance was subjective or objective I cannot\nsay, and I will not enter into conjectures, but will conclude by\nsaying that both H. and I are convinced that we saw the form\nof old James on that morning standing outside the inn and bend\ning down by the boats moored to the jetty.\nF. ROBERTSON-REID,\n(Late Capt. 3rd Cameronians.)\nWe wrote to Captain Robertson-Reid to make further\nenquiries, and after some delay on account of his having been\nabroad, obtained from him the name and address of his\nfriend Mr. H. This gentleman has kindly sent us the fol\nlowing account of his recollections of the incident.\nMay 18th, 1907.\nIt has been some time before I have been able to write out\nthe accompanying narrative of the incident regarding which you\nwrote me last month, and now I fear I have had to do so in a\nsomewhat rough shape. However it is perhaps best so, and I\nhave stated only what is simple fact. I found the matter sufficiently\ninteresting and thoughtful, and perhaps what has amused me (I\nuse the word only in the interested sense) most is that the appear\nance should be to two\u2014let us say reasonably practical men, one\nof whom is certainly not particularly imaginative, unless the\noccasion requires it, while there were standing there half-a-dozen\nSutherland crofters, specimens of a race wonderfully \" superstitious \"\nin their way. Many a yarn have I heard from them of the signs\nforetelling some death, or the noises and ghostly visions after such\nan occurrence. They, however, on this occasion were most stubborn\nin their lack of appreciation of the possibility of such a thing\nappearing as we believe appeared.\nAs descriptions of scenery and people are out of place in such\na narration as this, I will endeavour to be as brief as possible in\ndealing with them\u2014merely giving the few particulars necessary\nto enable any reader to more or less picture the scene.\nUp in the wilds of Sutherland, away from the beaten track of\ntrain or motor car, there stands a little fishing inn, popular among\nardent anglers by reason of the excellent trout fishing that the\nsurrounding country provides. So small and so confined is the\nlife there that visitors and inhabitants become within a few days\nwell acquainted with each other, and to one who, like myself,\n\fJULY, 1907. Case. 107\nhas paid a number of visits to the spot the faces and figures of\nall the country folk are very familiar.\nThe Inn itself stands on one of the mail roads running from\nnorth to south, and each day the mail car brings its little quota\nof passengers and letters to deposit along the route. A loch lies\nin front of the Inn, and out of its northern end flows a stream,\nand this and the road run parallel for two miles, when you come\nto a cross-roads. The mail car goes along to the right, while to\nthe left a narrow lane through the peat bogs branches off with\nthe stream and brings you after another two miles to a small\nhamlet, where the crofters and shepherds of the neighbourhood\ndwell. The river runs on to link into a chain four or five lochs,\nwhich lie beneath the shelter of the mountains fringing the north\nof Scotland. Over the mountain sides the crofters from the\nvillage graze their cattle and sheep and cut peat on the low-\nlying lands, but their most remunerative work is to act as ghillies\non the lochs for visitors at the Inn.\nSo it is that each day brings down from the village to the Inn a\nlittle band of men, varying according to the number of anglers\nstationed there. In the early morning the crofters thus engaged will\nwalk from their homes to the Inn and wait to take their various\nemployers out in the boats. The best of feelings exists between\ncrofters and anglers, and it is easy to understand how quickly one\ngets to know each face and form of those excellent men and how\nattached one becomes to them. There are few of those ghillies\nwhom I certainly would fail to literally tell in the dark.\nSo much for the place and its people, and it only remains for\nme to say that in narrating the following incident I have\nendeavoured to keep to the plain unembellished facts, telling them\nin as simple a form as I can.\nThe end of the 1906 fishing season was fast drawing to a close\nwith the advent of September, and on, I think it was the first\nWednesday of that month, there only remained at the Inn beside\nmyself, Captain R., a friend of mine, and a family who were due\nto leave on the Thursday morning. The Wednesday evening mail\nbrought an elderly gentleman and his wife, but their arrival, which\ntook place in my absence, escaped my attention, a point which\nis of some importance.\nOn Wednesday night the ghillies who were down at the Inn\nstopped until a late hour listening to a piper and among the last\nto leave was one James M'Kenzie. He was a particularly pleasant\n\f108 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1907.\nman of some 55 years of age, and both Capt. R. and I had\nemployed him as ghillie on various occasions and knew him very\nwell. It was very dark when M'Kenzie started off home, and he\nwas accompanied to the cross-roads by a lad. Here they said good\nnight, and James continued along the lane to the crofters' village.\nThat was the last time that he was seen alive, for, though we\ndid not know it until later, the poor fellow, evidently losing his\nway in the dark, stepped into the river and was drowned.\nThursday morning came and after breakfast I went out on to\nthe porch of the Inn, by the side of which the ghillies were\naccustomed to stand, and there as usual they were, half-a-dozen\nof them, and James M'Kenzie among them. Of him I was very\ncertain, for I wondered what brought him there on that day. For\nthe presence of all the others I could account. Two were there to\nbid farewell to the departing family, who had employed them ;\nCapt. R.'s and my ghillie were there, and also an old shepherd,\nwho was always to be seen about in the morning. But I could\nnot account for the presence of James. Had I recollected the old\ngentleman and his wife, for whom M'Kenzie had actually been\nengaged the night before, I should have thought no more about it,\nbut they had at that time entirely left my thoughts.\nI nodded a general good morning to the men, and entered the\nInn once more. Five minutes later I came out again with Capt. E.,\nand we walked arm-in-arm down to the little jetty that runs\nout into the loch facing the Inn, and to which the boats are\nmoored.\nDown by one of these boats, a dozen yards from where we stood,\nwas James M'Kenzie, bending down and apparently moving some\nthing in the boat. Capt. E. said : \" Good-morning, James ; \" but\nbeyond looking up, so that we both plainly saw his face, James\ngave no answer. Such a silence in a northern Scot is not remark\nable, and we walked back towards the Inn. As we did so, I said\nto my companion : \" What is old James doing here this morning ? \"\nThe question received no definite answer, but it was heard by an\nindependent party, the wife of the elderly gentleman. She heard\nthe question from her bedroom window, though without knowing\nfrom whom it came, and she noted it simply because she felt she\ncould give the answer, as James was to ghillie her husband.\nThis fact is of some importance, as proving that it was on that\nThursday morning that we saw James, and dispersing the theory\nthat was raised that it was on the previous morning.\n\fJULY, 1907. Case. 109\nAt this time we had not heard that M'Kenzie had never\nreached home the night before and though the crofters and our\nghillies among them had been out searching for him during the\nearly hours of the morning, we did not hear of the disappearance\nuntil we returned home that evening after fishing.\nAfter we had said \" Good-bye \" to our departing friends, Capt. R.\nand I set out together with our ghillies for a distant loch, and as\nwe walked I again asked what James was doing at the Inn that\nmorning. Capt. R. said that he did not know and the ghillies\ndid not, I think, hear me.\nArrived at the edge of the loch, I suddenly remembered the old\ngentleman of the night before and at once said : \" Oh ! old James\nmust be going to ghillie the old gentleman who arrived last night.\"\nIt was the constant recurrence of my thoughts to M'Kenzie and\nmy frequent allusions to him that as much as anything else con\nvinced, and still convince, me that I saw him that morning.\nIn the evening, on returning, I went straight up to my bedroom,\nleaving Capt. R. downstairs, and it appears that the parlour maid\ncame out to him and said : \" A strange thing has happened ; old\nJamie has gone astray.\" \" Nonsense,\" said the Captain, \" I saw him\nhere this morning ; \" but this the maid could not believe.\nCapt. R. then came straight up to me and simply said : \" A\nmost extraordinary thing has happened. Old James is lost.\" \" Not\nvery extraordinary,\" I said, \" I saw him here this morning.\" Thus\nindependently of one another we both at once said that we had\nseen him that morning.\nCapt. R. then told me what the maid had said and his own\nconvictions, and we went down to the innkeeper and told our tale.\nThe latter, however, would insist that we had been mistaken. Those\nvery ghillies, he said, with whom I had seen James standing after\nbreakfast had been hunting for him during the early morning, and\nhe certainly could not have been either upon the road or at the\nInn without being seen. His handkerchief had been found a short\nway from the cross-roads and had been placed in the centre of the\nroad, but had remained untouched.\nAll that night search parties were out among the peat bogs and\nalong the river banks, but it was not until Friday morning that\nwe found the poor fellow's body. A doctor who had arrived gave\nit as his positive opinion that the body must have been in the\nwater over 24 hours, and no doubt existed in any mind that it was\non that dark Wednesday night that James met his death.\n\f110 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1907.\nCapt. R. is still, and I think always will be, convinced that he\nsaw James M'Kenzie on the Thursday morning, and for his feelings\non the subject I will not speak. A word, however, as to my own\nmay help in some way to epitomise the story.\nMy first impression, as doubtless would be the case with any one\nso placed, was that the thing was impossible and that I must have\nmade some mistake. But the more I thought of it, the more con\nvinced was I and the more convinced have I become that I saw the\nfigure of the man there on that Thursday morning beyond the\nshadow of a doubt. My constant remarks and thoughts about him,\nmy question as to his presence being heard, my recollection of Capt.\nB.'s morning greeting to him, and our quite independently voiced\nbeliefs that we saw the man that morning, each is a sufficient conviction\nin itself. That he was drowned on the Wednesday night I am\nequally certain, and also that, had he been actually standing, in\nthe bodily flesh, among the ghillies and on the jetty when I saw\nhim, he was bound to have been seen by others besides myself,\nespecially as his absence was the chief subject of the ghillies'\nthoughts at that time.\nSuch is the simple narrative of an incident that must be taken for\nwhat it is worth. It is the plain truth, and I have endeavoured to\nleave nothing unsaid at the expense of being somewhat lengthy. . . .\nFRANKLIN HOLLAND.\nIn reply to enquiries as to the independence of these two\naccounts, Mr. Holland informed us that Captain Eobertson-Eeid\nhad originally submitted his account to him and he had\nsuggested a few merely verbal alterations which did not affect\nin any way the substance of the narrative. Mr. Holland\nread the account when it appeared in the Annals of Psychical\nScience and saw that Captain Eobertson-Eeid had adopted his\nsuggestions, but he had not since referred to or looked at it.\nIt seems, therefore, that the two witnesses agreed very closely\nin their recollections of the details of the incident. Mr.\nHolland did not know the address of the other gentleman\nwho was at the inn, and was not certain of his name, so\nthat no further corroboration has been yet obtainable.\nThe name and exact locality of the inn were communicated\nto us, but Mr. Holland believed that the proprietor would not\nwish this to be published.\n\fJULY, 1907. Criticism of the Society for Psychical Research. Ill\nA CEITICISM OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL\nRESEAECH.\nOUK attention has been drawn to some comments on the\npresent position of the S.P.Ii. made in the \"Notes of the\nMonth \" of the Occult Review for July, and as these comments\nseem to be chiefly based on misrepresentations of matters of\nfact, it may be worth while to give the facts briefly here.\nThe particular passage to which I refer runs as follows\n{op. cit. p. 3) :\nWhen, I wonder\u2014if ever\u2014will those 500 carefully investigated\nand selected cases of Dr. Eichard Hodgson's, which were pigeon-holed\non the premises of the Society in England for two years after they\nhad been sent over from America, and finally brought back by Dr.\nHodgson to America in disgust\u2014when, I ask, are these destined\nto see the light of day 1 They have now thrice crossed the Atlantic\nand are once more on English soil. It is very much to be hoped\nthat they are not destined to share the fate of that suppressed\nchapter of Mr. W. H. Myers' Magnum Opus on the subject of\n\" Trance Mediumship \" in which Dr. Hodgson collaborated, but\nwhich failed to pass the psychical censor.\nThe \"500 carefully investigated and selected cases of Dr.\nRichard Hodgson's \" exist, I am sorry to say, only in the\nimagination of the editor of the Occult Review. They are not,\nat least, and never were, to be found in any pigeon-holes\nknown to the officers of the Society. Dr. Hodgson was\naccustomed, while acting as Secretary to the American Branch\nof the Society, to send over to London such cases as he thought\nmight be suitable for publication, and many of these have\nappeared from time to time in the Proceedings or Journal. A\ncertain number of them were returned to Dr. Hodgson at\nhis own request to add to the material which for several\nyears he had been accumulating for articles that he was planning\nto write on various topics connected with psychical research.\nAs is well known, his premature death prevented him from\nmaking any use of this material. Other cases received by\nthe Branch, the evidence for which was either dubious or\nincomplete, were filed and stored in the office at Boston.\n\f112 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1907.\nAfter the dissolution of the Branch, the whole remainder\nof its material was, as readers will remember, brought\nover to England. It is now being examined and cases\ncoming up to our evidential standard\u2014probably not very\nnumerous\u2014will gradually appear in the Journal or Proceedings.\nThe Editor of the Occult Review speaks further of a\n\" suppressed chapter of Mr. W. H. Myers' Magnum Opus on\nthe subject of Trance Mediumship.\" For more than a year\nbefore Mr. F. W. H. Myers's death I assisted him in preparing\nHuman Personality for publication, and after his death I\ncollaborated with Mr. Hodgson in editing and bringing out the\nbook. I am therefore in a position to state that the only\nchapter on trance mediumship which ever existed is that\nwhich appears in Vol. II. (Chapter IX.). It is perhaps hardly\nnecessary to add that the book was published independently\nof the Society.\nWhether or not the general policy of the Society is guided\nby sound principles is of course a matter of opinion. But\nit would be well that opinions should not be founded on\nrandom assertions made by persons entirely unacquainted\nwith the circumstances to which they refer.\nALICE JOHNSON.\n\fNo. CCXLIL\u2014VOL.

GOT., 1907-\nINCEEASE IN THE STAFF OF THE SOCIETY.\nTHE Society begins work this month with the strengthened\nstaff announced in the last number of the Journal. The new\nSecretary and Editor, Mr. E. A. H. Bickford-Smith, who is a\npublic school and University man, and was called to the\nBar in 1886, has long been interested in the Society's\ninvestigations, and combines with experience in literary,\nsecretarial, and organising work, a wide knowledge of men\nand things acquired in travelling. Though he has hitherto\nhad little time for actively prosecuting psychical research,\npractical work at the British School of Archaeology at Athens\nhas accustomed him to scientific observation and inference.\nWe believe that the Society is fortunate in securing his\nservices, and that there will be no reason to regret the loss\nof Miss Johnson's help in the administrative part of the\nSociety's work, as she is thereby set free for experiment,\ninvestigation, the preparation of reports on work done, and\nother matters concerned with research proper.\nNo one knows till he has tried how much time and energy\nis required, not only for experiment, but for profitable study of\nthe results of experiment and observation, and for setting forth\nthese results in a form useful to others. Yet without this,\nreal knowledge of the subjects which our Society investigates\ncannot progress, and the Society becomes a mere bureau for the\nrecord of sporadic observations. In its early days it had the\nadvantage of Edmund Gurney's undivided time and thought, and\nthe result in advancing and systematising our knowledge is\nevident to all. Mr. Myers' work from the foundation of the\nSociety till his death is probably even better known to present\nmembers of the Society through his work on Human Personality.\nWe cannot hope to fill the place of these pioneers, though\nwe still have workers devoting their main energies to Psychical\nEesearch, and still have many valuable helpers. At all periods\nof the Society's existence, however, more work would have\nbeen done, and probably more progress made, had there\nbeen more workers with time, knowledge, and ability to do\nit. The Council has therefore long looked forward to the\ntime when the Endowment Fund, of which the nucleus is\n\fOCT., 1907. Increase in the Staff of the Society. 115\nMr. Aksakoffs legacy, should have accumulated sufficiently\nto justify the appointment of a paid student or official ex\nclusively engaged in investigation. If they have a little\nforestalled the time when the fund should reach the amount\nthey fixed, it is because unworked material, partly obtained\nthrough the energy of Miss Johnson, has accumulated on\ntheir hands : and it is in the hope that general approval of\nthe step they have taken will lead to further contributions\nbeing made to the Fund.1 It must be remembered that\nthough the steadily growing membership of the Society increases\nits income, it also increases its expenses. Moreover, more\nwork, if it leads to more publication, will increase the printing\nbill, and for more officers more office accommodation is\nnecessary and has indeed already been acquired. The general\nfunds cannot therefore be drawn on to any large extent to\npay the Eesearch Officer's salary.\nThe first piece of work which Miss Johnson as Eesearch\nOfficer proposes to undertake is a report on the automatic\nscript of \" Mrs. Holland,\" of which she gave us a preliminary\nsketch at the last meeting of the Society. The script is\nvoluminous and complicated, and any adequate investigation of\nit must take a good deal of time, as will easily be understood\nby those who heard the paper on it read. As there indicated,\nmuch of it runs parallel to and has to be considered in\nconnection with some of Mrs. Verrall's automatic script, and to\na certain extent with the results of last winter's work with\nMrs. Piper. These results are being carefully studied, and Mr.\nPiddington hopes to give a first report on them at the next\nmeeting.\nIt is hoped that the creation of a special department for\nresearch will tend to the encouragement of experimental work\namong members of the Society, and that those who are already\nengaged in independent systematic investigation in any branch\nof the Society's work will communicate with the Eesearch Officer\nor in some instances\u2014as opportunity arises\u2014co-operate with her.\nIt is not contemplated that travelling about to investigate\nsporadic cases of spontaneous phenomena should as a rule form\npart of the Eesearch Officer's duties ; and accounts of such\n1 Any such contributions should be sent to the Treasurer of the Endowment\nFund, Mr. J.

Vision.\nThe following case was sent to Dr. Hodgson by Mrs. Ward.\nBoth Mrs. Ward and her sister, Mrs. Eobinson, the percipient,\nwere Associates of the American Branch. Mrs. Ward writes :\n620 DIVISION STREET,\nCHICAGO, May 28th, 1903.\n... I hope my sister, Mrs. Helen Avery Robinson, of Anchor\nage, Kentucky, has written you of an experience she had a few\ndays ago. At the risk of repeating, I will tell you and will also\nask her to write you.\nAfter going to bed she rose to answer the telephone. The call\nwas not for her and she laid down again, but did not go to\nsleep. Then she saw her son yiDh a friend in a buggy driving\nuphill. The buggy tipped over, her son sprang up and caught\nthe horse's head. In a few minutes it was righted again, and they\nwent on. She was not frightened, for she saw that nothing serious\nhad happened. A little later her son came in and began to tell\nabout the accident, when she interrupted with: \"You need not\ntell me. I can tell you all about it.\" Whereupon she described\nthe place and every detail of the accident accurately. This is as\ntold me by my daughter, who has just come from Anchorage.\nLYDIA AVERY COONLEY WARD.\nMrs. Eobinson writes to Dr. Hodgson :\nBONNYCOT, ANCHORAGE,\nKENTUCKY, June 7th, 1903.\nIn compliance with my sister's request and yours as well as\nwith my own interest in psychic phenomenon, I shall write you\nof this last experience that came to me on the night of May 17th.\nMy son and a friend had driven across the country to dine and\nspend the evening with friends. The rest of the household had\n\fOCT., 1907. Coses. 117\nretired for the night. I was awakened by the telephone and\nlooked at the clock, finding it 11.30 p.m. I knew my son would\nsoon be in and thought of a window downstairs which I felt\nmight not have been locked, and determined to remain awake and\nask my son to make sure that it was secure. As I lay waiting\nand listening for him I suddenly saw their vehicle, a light break-\ncart, turn over, my son jump out, land on his feet, run to the\nstruggling horse's head, his friend hold to the lines, and in a\nmoment it was gone and I knew it was right and felt no\ndisturbance.\nI met my son as he came in and spoke of the window. He\nsaid : \" We tipped over, mother.\" I replied \" Yes. I know it, I\nsaw you,\" and described what I saw as I have to you, which he\nsaid was just as it happened. He also said : \" I thought for a\nmoment the horse would go up over the railroad tracks,\" and then\nI remembered that the horse, as I saw him, was thrown up an\nembankment. I said : \" This happened about half-an-hour ago.\"\nHe looked at his watch, it was 12.15, and said \"Yes.\" I did\nnot see them before they started out, as his friend called for him\nwith his horse and vehicle, and I did not know in what style they\nwent. . . .\nHELEN AVERY ROBINSON.\nMrs. Eobinson's son confirms the account as follows :\nJune 23rd, 1903.\nOn Sunday night, May 17th, I was driving with a friend from\nGlenview to Anchorage, Kentucky. We left Glenview at about\neleven o'clock. We were in a break-cart, and my friend was\ndriving a young and spirited horse. There was no moon, and\nwe could see indistinctly by star-light. About twelve o'clock,\nwhen about two miles from home, we were driving along the edge\nof a wood with a deep railroad cut on our right. The top of\nthis embankment had lately been levelled off and my friend mis\ntook it for the road, which was just beside the embankment and,\nin the faint light, seemed to be about level with it. When I\ncalled his attention to his mistake he turned down into the road\nand overturned the cart. We were both thrown out. The horse\nwas startled and began rearing. I ran around the cart after\nhim and took him by the bridle, although my friend had not lost\nhis hold on the reins. We righted the cart and got home with\nout further accident. The family had been in bed for some time,\n\f118 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1907.\nbut my mother had been aroused at eleven-thirty by the telephone.\nAs I came in she gave me the message. I told her that we had\noverturned the cart. She then told me that she had seen the\naccident at twelve o'clock and, without suggestion from me,\ndescribed it accurately. She had seen me thrown out backward\nand knew how I had run around after the frightened horse to\ncatch his bridle, which I did only after he had turned completely\naround.\nAVERY ROBINSON.\nL. 1161. Simultaneous Dreams.\nThe following case was obtained for the American Branch\nthrough Dr. M. L. Holbrook, of 46 East 21st Street, New York,\nformerly an Associate of the Branch. The witnesses requested\nthat their names should not be published. The first account\nis given in a letter from Mr. E. J. to his brother Mr. G. J.\n(who was also an Associate of the American Branch), as\nfollows :\nJanuary 6th, 1901.\nMy bed stands with the head against the west wall of the room,\nhead next the door. Annie's bed stands directly opposite, head\nagainst the east wall, with a space of about six feet between them.\nI dreamed on Friday night that mother came into the room,\npassed beside my bed, looked at me and went to the foot of Annie's\nbed. The impression was so strong that it awoke me.\nI told my dream at breakfast and Annie remarked, \"How queer\nthat is ; for I dreamed last night that your mother came into the\nroom, leaned over the foot of my bed, with her arms crossed just\nas she always used to stand and talk when I was sick. She said\nthat Fred told her that I did not realise how sick my mother was,\nand that she would not live three months, and that startled me\nso that I woke up.\"\nNow, perhaps you can explain this. If you can, I should like to\nhave you do so.\nMrs. B. is better than she has been for some time, sits up some\nevery day, walks about a little.\nMr. G. J., in a letter to Dr. Hodgson, dated February 15th,\n1901, enclosing the above, states that Mrs. B., the mother of\n\"Annie,\" was then 83 years old, and had been expected to\ndie at almost any time during the previous year; that his\nown mother had died in 1883 and his brother Fred in 1858,\nand that his sister-in-law had never known this brother. Mr.\n\f:OCT., 1907. Cases. 119\nE. J., on being applied to by Dr. Hodgson, wrote to him as\nfollows :\nFebruary 23, 1901.\nReplying to your letters of 21st to Mrs. J. and myself, the facts\nfollow. The room in which I sleep has two beds standing foot to\nfoot, about five feet apart. My bed stands nearest the door entering\nfrom the hall. One night, about a month since, I dreamed that\n'my mother, who has been dead nearly twenty years, entered the\nroom from the hall, passed down beside my bed, looking at me,\nand stopped at the foot of my wife's bed. The impression was\nso strong that I awoke. In the morning I related at the breakfast\ntable the dream and my wife immediately said, \" How strange\nthat is ; for I dreamed last night that your mother came into the\nroom and leaned over the foot of the bed, just as she always\nused to when she came into the room when I was sick. She\nmade some remarks about the care of my mother, and said that\nFred said that she (Mrs. B.) would not be with us a great while.\"\nFred was a brother who died many years ago, and whom my wife\nnever met. This made so strong an impression on her that she\nawoke, but as neither knew that the other was awake, of course\nthere was no fixing the time of the dreams. . . .\nMrs. J.'s secretary wrote to Dr. Hodgson as follows :\nMarch 1st, 1901.\nIn reply to your letter of February 25th, Mrs. J. directs me to\nsay that she has nothing to add to or change to make in the\nstatement made by Mr. J.\nDr. Hodgson afterwards learnt from Mr. J. that Mrs. B.\ndied on June 12th, 1901.\nL. 1162. Simultaneous Dreams.\nThe following is another case of simultaneous dreams by a\nhusband and wife, also obtained through the American Branch.\nThe witnesses desire that their names should not be published,\nfor fear of newspaper notoriety. Mr. D. wrote to Dr. Hodgson\nas follows :\nJune 18th, 1899.\nNoticing your address in the N.Y. Sunday Journal of even date,\nI write to tell you of an instance of telepathy in which, as an\nadditional straw, your Society may find interest.\nIn the summer of '97, one night while sleeping I dreamed that\nI was in an old, abandoned and ruined saw-mill, which was built\n\u2022 on timbers out over a river. The plank floor was gone except\nfor now and then a plank, and the water, about eight feet below,\n\f120 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1907.\nlooked black, stagnant and slimy. There were just enough planks\nand timbers left to cause a \"creepy,\" shadowy darkness to prevail\nbelow. There were two ladies came to look at the place, and being\nafraid to trust the planks for footing, I took one on each arm,\nand was proceeding out to the further end of the ruin, over the\nwater to where the old saw was, when something white glimmering\nin the water below through the dusk attracted my attention, and\nI saw it to be the face of my wife, Mrs. D., just showing above\nthe water, with her large eyes looking into mine, but without a\nmotion or sound. I immediately jumped into the water and caught\nher round the shoulders and neck to support her, and at that instant\nwas roused from sleep by a smothered cry from Mrs. D. at my side.\nIntuitively I knew how matters were and asked her (after shaking\nher to awaken her) what she had dreamed to frighten her.\nShe said that she was dreaming that she was in the water\ndrowning and was trying to reach up her arms to help herself,.\nand cried out as I heard her. . . .\nMrs. D. wrote to Dr. Hodgson :\nJune 22nd, 1899.\nIn reply to your letter of the 20th to Mr. Davis, relating to\nour \" dreams,\" I will relate my experience as perfectly as possible.\nThe first sensation I remember in my dream was of finding\nmyself sinking in a pool, a large pool, or pond of water by the\nroadside, and of throwing up my arms above the water and try\ning to scream for help, and just as I felt my hand grasped by\nsome one, I could not tell by whom, to help me, Mr. Davis spoke\nand I awoke.\nI sometimes have unpleasant dreams and make a slight sound,\nwhen he always wakens me, but we both thought it remarkable\nwhen on this occasion we found that there was perfect coincidence\nin the time, even to a second, and almost perfect coincidence in\nthe subject matter of our dreams.\nMr. D. sent to Dr. Hodgson on July 3rd, 1899, an account\nof an apparently telepathic impression that had occurred to\nhim a few weeks before in regard to the death of a friend.\nHe had had a strong impression of her presence, and that\nshe told him she was dead. He informed his wife of this\nat the time, and they heard later the same day that the\nlady had died about 24 hours before the impression occurred.\nThey knew, however, that she had been seriously ill, though\nit was believed that she was then recovering.\nL. 1163. Thought-transference.\nThe following case seems to be an instance of spontaneous\nthought-transference, in which the triviality of the idea con\n\fOCT., 1907. Cases. 121\nveyed does not detract from the cogency of the incident.\nThe account comes from Mr. F. W. Caulfeild, who writes :\nSYDMONTON, HAYWARDS HEATH, July 7, 1905.\nIn the autumn of 1903 my daughter and myself went to visit\nan old friend of mine, a clergyman, who had lately been appointed\nto a country living on the hanks of the Thames, and whom I had\nnot seen for many years. My friend met us at the station in his\npony carriage, and while driving us to his house told us of an\nattempt he had made to organise the charities of his own and the\nneighbouring parishes. He said he had written to a friend in an\nadjoining parish on the subject, and that he, i.e. my friend, parti\ncularly objected to the practice, when a poor man had met with\nsome loss, of sending him round the neighbourhood with a signed\npetition to collect money.\nSuddenly an idea flashed on my mind which I remember appeared\nto me rather smart and witty, and I said : \" After all, pigs are not\nimmortal,\" meaning of course that a poor man with a pig must\nexpect that it may die some time, and should lay his account for\nthat beforehand. My friend said : \" Why that's just what I said\nin my letter; I said, ' Even pigs are not immortal.'\"\nJudging from the very unusual character of the phrase, and from\nmy own sensations at the time I used it, I think it must have\nbeen directly suggested to my mind.\nFRANCIS W. CAULFEILD.\nP.S.\u2014I ought to add that to the best of my memory pigs had\nnot been previously mentioned in our conversation ; my thoughts\nhad naturally turned to horses or cows.\nIn answer to a request for corroboration, Miss Caulfeild\nwrites :\nSYDMONTON, HAYWARDS HEATH, July llth [1905].\nIn reply to your letter of July 10, which my father has given\nme, it is difficult, after more than a year and a half, to recall the\nincident clearly.\nI remember sitting beside our host who was driving, and at the\nsame time looking back every now and then over his shoulder to\nspeak to my father, who was sitting on the back seat.\nOur host was describing what a pitch the sending round of\nbegging petitions had come to in his parish, and my father said\nquickly, \" After all, even pigs are mortal.\"\nOur host laughed, and, looking back at my father, said : \" How\nstrange ; those were the very words I used in my letter to .\nI said : ' Even pigs are mortal.' \" I underline pigs, because I remem\nber he laid stress on the word.\nDOROTHY CAULFEILD.\nP.S.\u2014I remember feeling a little injured that our host did not\nlaugh more heartily at my father's ban mot, which of course was\nexplained, as he had made it himself before.\n\f122 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1907.\nNOTE ON THE VISIONS OF ANNA K. EMMERICH.\nIN a review in The Guardian of March 13th, 1907, of\nProfessor W. M. Eamsay's Pauline and Other Studies in Early\nChristian History, there is some discussion of the visions of\nAnna Katharina von Emmerich, the publication of which by\nClement Brentano led to the discovery of the so-called House\nof the Virgin near Ephesus on July 29th, 1891. Anna\nEmmerich died in 1824, and Brentano's report of her\nvisions was founded on his conversations with her, but was\nnot published till 1841. His best-known book on the subject\nis Leben der heil. Jungfrau Maria, nach der Anna K. Emmerich\nBdrachtungen (Miinchen, 1852). The reviewer states that\nfrom what he had heard from a friend of his who had\nknown Brentano well and had often talked to him about\nthe Westphalian nun in whose visions he was so much\ninterested; it seemed clear that Brentano had quite innocently\nsupplied her with material for some of her visions. He told\nher, for instance, about the Spanish Franciscan nun, Maria\nde Agreda, whose visions are recorded in The Mystic City of\nGod, and of an attempt to get her canonised. A few days later\nAnna had a vision representing this attempt in a symbolical\nmanner. Brentano's report of her may probably be taken as\naccurate as far as it goes, but uncritical as to the means by\nwhich she might have learnt the facts represented in her\nvisions. The reviewer thinks it likely that some one had\nsupplied her with information about Ephesus ; for, whereas the\ntourist generally approaches Ephesus from the north, she\nmakes St. John and the Virgin, coming from Jerusalem, see\nwhat is visible from the north and not from the south.\n\" She also commits the absurd mistake of making St. John\nfind a Christian community at Ephesus in the sixth year\nafter the Crucifixion. Nevertheless, the curious fact remains\nthat her descriptions led to the so-called House of the Virgin\nbeing discovered. It is the ruin of a mediaeval church, but it\nis thought that part might belong to a building of the first\ncentury.\" l\n1 Some photographs of this building are reproduced in an illustrated article\non the subject, entitled \" Panaghia Capouli ; or, the House of the Blessed\nVirgin Mary at Ephesus,\" by W. F. Griffitt Blackler, in The Treasury, April,\nJ907.\n\fOCT., 1907. Note on the Visions of Anna K. Emmerich. 123\nWe wrote to the Guardian reviewer, asking if he could\ngive us any more information about Brentano's investigation\nof Anna Emmerich, and he replied in the following letter,\nwhich he kindly allows us to print here :\nDULANY, BlDEFORD,\nNORTH DEVON, May 4, 1907.\nI cannot tell you much more about Anna K. von Emmerich.\nThe chief thing to note for your purpose is that the nun evidently\nreproduced in her visions the materials with which Brentano supplied\nher, and he took down the visions and revelations as she related\nthem to him. These chiefly had reference to the Passion of Christ,\ngoing into minute details, which are not found anywhere but in\nlegends. Brentano's report of these visions was published in German\nand French. The London Library, I think, has La douleureuse\nPassion de Jdsus, by A. K. Emmerich. Brentano apparently did not\nsee that a great deal of what she told him was what he had told\nher, transformed into a vision by a very excitable temperament, a\nvery active imagination, and perhaps a little deceit.\nMy informant was Dr. Dollinger, whom I knew very well\nindeed. . . . Dollinger's opinion was that in such cases there was\ngenerally an element of deceit. \" The temptation to be ' interesting '\nis to most women irresistible.\" You may care to know that\nDolliuger had known a case of stigmatization like that reported of\nS. Francis. It was in the Tyrol. \"The woman had a reputation\nfor great sanctity, and pilgrimages were made to see her. I was\nliving close by, and saw her several times and observed her. She\nwas constantly in a state of ecstasy, quite unconscious. I remarked\nthat flies walked about over her eyeballs without her taking any\nnotice. She was confined to her bed. But every Thursday evening\nand Friday she gave herself up to the contemplation of the Passion,\nkneeling up in bed in quite an ecstatic condition. When she\nreturned to consciousness she did not speak for some time, but\nmade signs of recognition. The stigmata were rosy-coloured spots\non her hands, and she was believed to have the same on her feet.\nThe latter I did not see. How the marks were produced I do\nnot pretend to say. It is not yet sufficiently known how far such\nthings may be the result of natural causes, e.g. of a very violently\nexcited imagination.\" This is from notes of a conversation in\n1872. ...\nA. PLUMMEB.\nDr. Plummer was not able to tell us whether an account\nof this case of stigmatisation had ever been published. The\nphenomenon is now of course a well-recognised one, and the\nmost instructive discussion of it is to be found in Mr. Myers's\nHuman Personality, Vol. I., pp. 188 and 491-499.\n\f124 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1907.\nTHE PEOCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY\nFOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nTHE second Part of the Proceedings of the new American\nSociety contains a good deal of matter which should be\ninteresting to our members.\nThe first article, by Professor William James, discusses a\nstriking case of clairvoyance reported to him by Dr. Harris\nKennedy, a cousin of Mrs. James. The case occurred in\n1898 and accounts were obtained within a few days of the\noccurrence, but, for some reason that does not appear, have\nnot been published until now. They relate to the finding of\nthe body of a drowned girl through impressions received in\ntrance by a certain Mrs. Titus, a non-professional medium.\nThe girl had disappeared from her home early on Monday\nmorning, Oct. 31st, 1898, having been last seen by a few\npeople in the street leading to a bridge across a lake, and\nby one person on the bridge. Some 150 men were hunting\nfor her in the woods and on the lake shore all that day and\nduring the next two days a diver searched the lake in vain\nfor her body. Mrs. Titus lived in a village about 4| miles\nfrom the home of the girl, whom she did not know, though\nher husband worked in the same mill with the girl's sister.\nOn Sunday she told her husband that something awful was\ngoing to happen, and on Monday morning, just as he was\nleaving for the mill, she said it had happened. At noon\nhe told her that the sister had gone home\u2014it was imagined\nbecause her mother was ill ; in the evening they heard that\nthe girl was missing, and on Tuesday Mrs. Titus talked about\nit and said she was in the lake,\u2014which was of course a\nnatural guess to make.\nOn Wednesday evening Mrs. Titus became entranced, and\non being wakened by her husband said if he had let her\nalone she could have discovered by the morning where the\ngirl was. That night she had two more trances, during which\nshe told her husband that she saw the girl standing on a\nfrost-covered log on the bridge, that her foot slipped and\nshe fell backwards into the water, and that she was lying\nin a certain place by the bridge, head downwards between\n\fOCT., 1907. The Proceedings of the American Society. 125\ntwo logs, the body covered with mud and brush and one\nfoot projecting with a new rubber shoe on. A curious point\nreported by Mr. Titus was that when questioned about the\ngirl she would answer, but apparently she did not hear him\nwhen he spoke to her of other things.\nIn the morning Mr. Titus told his wife's experience to\na friend of his and to the foreman at the mill where he\nworked (both of whom confirm the account fully) and obtained\nleave from the latter to take his wife to the lake. After\ngoing to the bridge and identifying the place seen in her\nvision, Mrs. Titus went with her husband to the house of a\nmill-owner, Mr. Whitney, who had mainly organised the search\nfor the body and employed the diver. They told their\nstory and persuaded Mr. Whitney to return to the bridge\nwith them and order the diver to go down at the point\nindicated by Mrs. Titus. He did so and found the body\njust in the place and position described. The testimony\nof the diver, which, as well as that of Mr. Whitney, is given\nin full detail, shows that the body was found at a depth of\nabout 1 8 feet in the water ; that the water was so dark\nthat no one could see into it ; and that he himself could\nsee nothing while in the water, but found the body entirely\nby feeling.\nThe evidence for the facts in this case is unusually full and\nstrong ; as to their supernormal character, the main question\nwould seem to be how much information existed in the neighbour\nhood about the girl's doings which might have furnished the\nmaterial for Mrs. Titus's trance-impressions. It seems that there\nwas a light frost that morning and that the girl's footprints were\ntraced on to the bridge and up to a distance unrecorded upon\nit. This was known to all the town ; but that no definite\nclue was really afforded by these footprints was shown by\nthe fact that the searchers who knew of them were never\ntheless hunting the woods as well as the lake side, while\nthe diver had searched along both sides of the bridge, which,\nit is important to note, was from an eighth to a quarter of\na mile long. There was every reason to believe that Mrs.\nTitus had not been to the place since the accident, nor\u2014\nMr. Whitney says\u2014for two or three years previously ; so\nthat it is difficult to suppose that she could have had any\n\f126 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1907.\nnormal means of forming a judgment as to the whereabout*\nof the body.\nIn the next article, entitled \" The M'Caffrey Case,\" by\nProfessor Hyslop, another instance of supposed clairvoyance\nis related. A young man named Michael M'Caffrey dreamt\nthat an English soldier appeared to him and told him to\ndig near a certain stump where he would find a paper which\nthe soldier had received from the Bank of England for money\ndeposited there. On digging he found an old paper between\nsome flat stones. Another dream instructed him to dig\ndeeper at the same place, and he did so and found another\nold paper in a bottle. These papers purported to be two-\ncertificates of deposit in the Bank of England for \u00a34000\nand \u00a310,000 respectively. They turned out on examination\nto be forgeries ; but there seems strong evidence that M'Caffrey\ndiscovered them as the result of information given in his\ndream.\nThe whole story is told in great detail at considerable\nlength, and illustrates well the essential weakness\u2014from an\nevidential point of view\u2014of cases of this type. For it\nappears that many years previously a certain man had been\nfound hung on a tree on the farm of M'Caffrey's grandfather.\nHe was a friend of the M'Caffreys, and there was some\nsuspicion of foul play in connection with his death, and also-\na report that M'Caffrey's father had made vague references\nfrom time to time to a possible fortune to be found under\nthe pine stumps on his farm. Perhaps the most plausible\nhypothesis is that the dead man had some papers\u2014supposed\nto be valuable, but really forgeries\u2014which had been either\ngiven to or taken by the M'Caffreys ; that they had kept\nthem concealed for a long time to avert suspicion in con\nnection with the death ; that young M'Caffrey had heard\nsomething of the story as a child, and that his recollection\nof it was revived in dreams.\nIt is at least impossible to disprove some such normal\nexplanation of the facts, and the case is instructive as\nillustrating the practical impossibility of proving any person's\nignorance of long past events of which there are always an\nindefinite number of possible sources of information. Thus\nit differs essentially from the case given by Professor James,\n\fOCT., 1907. The Proceedings of the American Society. 127\nwhere the percipient's vision related to an event only two\ndays old, all the most important circumstances of which could\nbe investigated on the spot.\nThe Part concludes with an interesting report of an investi\ngation of a Poltergeist case by Mr. Hereward Carrington, a\nmember of our own Society and one of Professor Hyslop's\nmost active colleagues in America, author of an important\nbook on The Physical Phenomena of Spiritualism which we\nhope to notice soon in the Proceedings. This was a\ncase which appeared very promising at the outset, the\nprincipal witness being an educated man, \" Mr. X.,\" Judge\nfor the Probate for the County of Hants in Nova Scotia,\nwhose testimony was confirmed by several other persons.\nMr. X.'s account, however, showed him to be a person of\nextremely credulous nature, as well as occasionally subject to\nhallucinations, and Mr. Carrington found that the phenomena\nwere the result of an organised trickery practised on him\nby the people of the small town where he lived. Probably\nthis is an extreme case of imposture generated by a readiness\nto be imposed upon, but no doubt the same thing often occurs\nin a milder degree.\nIt is very satisfactory that the American Society should\nalready have found so much material of interest and value,\nand it is hardly necessary to add that their cautious and\nscientific treatment of it shows that they are fully alive to\nthe necessity for keeping up the standard of evidence in\npsychical research.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nTHE ARENSBURG POLTERGKIST.\nIN connection with the disturbances of coffins in the cemetery\nat Arensburg in 1844 (see Journal S.P.E., February, 1907),\nCount Perovsky Petrovo-Solovovo sends us the following\nletter which he received from a leading member of the\nBnxhoewden family, in whose vault the disturbances had\noccurred. The explanation offered seems to account satis\nfactorily for all the facts of the case. It may be added that\n\f128 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Telepathic Impression.\nThe subjoined report was sent to Dr. Hodgson by Mr. G.\nV. Chase. Most of the information comes from the percipient,\nMrs. Adam, but some of the cases are confirmed by other\nwitnesses. Mrs. Adam states that her account is based on\nher diaries ; but no other contemporary records seem to exist.\nThe case is therefore not very strong evidentially, but it is\ninstructive as showing the apparent mixture of telepathy with\nconscious observation and inference, thus throwing light on the\nmethods which are no doubt used by professional clairvoyants.\nMrs. Adam is a sister-in-law of Mr. G. V. Chase. The\nlatter's account is as follows :\nNEOSHO, Mo., Mar. 7th, 1900.\nMy dear Dr. Hodgson,\u2014Anent my letter of yesterday let me\ngive you a little experience\u2014my first\u2014with telepathy of the living.\nSome seven or eight years ago my wife's sister, who is the\nwife of one of the editors of the \" San Francisco Call \" (newspaper)\nhad an attack of La Grippe. (Soon after her recovery she\nspontaneously developed this faculty in a wonderful degree, and\nin nearly every letter to her sister (my wife) she recounted some\nof her experiences. We were all avowed Agnostics. In August\nof 1895 I had occasion to visit San Francisco, and was of course\nthe guest of Mrs. Adam, my sister-in-law, and her husband.\nSoon after my arrival I alluded to the subject and asked her to\ntry to read my mind. She consented, and, taking my left hand\nin her left, she explained that under these conditions she had the\nbest success, making her mind as complete a blank as it was\npossible. To this latter end she toyed aimlessly with a pack of\ncards lying in her lap\u2014and waited for \"impressions.\" After some\ntime she announced that she got absolutely nothing, and said that\nwith some she never had any success. I remarked that perhaps\nit was because I was not thinking of anything persistently or\ndeeply. She replied by telling me to think of some occurrence\nof recent date\u2014say some man I had met\u2014his name and features.\nI thought of a gentleman I had met the morning before on the\nplatform at Bakersfield as the train was changing engines. He\nstepped up to me, accosting me by name and said : \" You don't\n\fNov., 1907. Cases. 131\nremember me, do you?\" I confessed that I did not. He said,\n\"My name is Harris,\" and reminded me that some years ago\nwhen I was Aide-de-Camp to Gen. Howard, he came to our\nHeadquarters in S. F. with a letter of introduction from my\nbrother\u2014and that I gave him a pass on the Government steamer\n\"M'Dowall\" for a trip about the bay. Even then I could not\nrecall him. He told me he was going up to Grass Valley to look\nafter some mining interests in a few days and hoped to see me in\nS, F. Well, I thought of this man. Presently Mrs. A. said, \"His\nname is of two syllables\u2014accented on the first\"\u2014 and then she\nasked me to signify assent if it was true\u2014as it seemed to help\nher. I therefore said \" Yes.\" After perhaps ten seconds she said,\n\" It is a name that sounds like ' Parish,' \" but, she added quickly,\n\"That's not it\"\u2014a slight pause\u2014\"It is Harris.\" I, much astonished,\nsaid it was\u2014when she added, \"And his initials are 'C. H.,'\" or\nwhatever they were (I have now forgotten). I said that I did\nnot know what his initials were. Then she began to describe the\nappearance of Mr. Harris, I assenting as she went on, and her\ndescription was as accurate as I could have given. A day or so\nafterwards she and I were going across the Bay to Berkeley to\nmake a call, and arrived at the ferry depot just too late to catch\nthe boat, and had to wait for the next one. As we sat in the\nwaiting-room I saw this Mr. Harris enter, and at once went to\nhim, shook hands, and brought him over and introduced him to\nmy sister. I told him of the matter wherein his name figured ;\nand before relating that part concerning his initials, I suddenly\nsaid, \" By the way, Mr. Harris, what are your initials ? \" He\nsaid \"C. H.,\" or whatever they were, but the same ones given by\nMrs. A. It is of course possible and probable that his initials were\nupon the letter of introduction, but they were certainly gone from\nmy conscious memory. Another instance :\nMr. Adam is an Englishman, and generally meets most of his\ncountrymen of note who pass through S. F., and sometimes brings\nthem home. One (not sure which) evening at Mrs. A.'s \"At\nHome\" quite a number filled her parlour, and among them a young\nEnglishman\u2014a stranger Mr. A. had picked up somewhere. The\nconversation turned upon the subject of telepathy, and this young\nman expressed much doubt of its reality, but begged Mrs. A. to\n\"see if she could get anything\" for him.

V. CHASE.\nCOLASI, PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, August 15th, 1902.\nDear Doctor,\u2014As you desire some record of my telepathic ex\nperiences and my own views as to their source, I take pleasure in\nsending you the following account which I gathered from old diaries.\nI greatly regret that more complete records have not been kept.\nIn February, 1893, the Olympic Athletic Club of San Francisco\ngave a fete for the benefit of its treasury, and I was asked to take\ncharge of Sybil's booth. I had often read character from physiognomy\nand tricks of manner common to certain types, but prior to this I\nhad never tried telepathy.\nAfter the first evening in the booth I was walking home with a\nBritisher named Gadsden (now dead). As we walked along he\nsaid, \" You don't really think you can tell anything, do you ? \" I\nreplied that I claimed to have no occult gift whatever. He said,\n\" No one in this city or in America, for that matter, knows my\nbirth-place. Could you tell me that, I would believe in telepathic\ncommunication.\"\nAfter a short silence (during which I was holding his arm) I\nsaid, \"Bonchurch in the Isle of Wight comes to me.\" My com\npanion seemed much agitated, and said with surprise, \" You are\n\fNov., 1907. Cases. 133\nright, and now I am convinced that you have some peculiar\npower.\"\n\" Well,\" I replied, \" I thought of Ventnor first, so you see I was\nonly guessing.\"\n\"Still more wonderful,\" said Gadsden, \"for I was born ten miles\nfrom the coast midway between Bonchurch and Ventnor. I chose\nthe question as being one impossible for you to answer unless you\ncould read my mind.\"\nNow, I look on that as a good case of pure mind-reading. I\ntook courage from this experience, and during the rest of the fete\nI intrepidly read the past and future of those who came to my\nbooth, and often with startling success, which I attribute, in part,\nto my own self-assurance.\nSince 1893 I have told thousands of \"fortunes\" by impressions,\nand probably been successful with seventy-five out of a hundred.\nThe greater number of trials have been with contact, though trials\nwithout contact, while on the whole not so successful, have some\ntimes given striking results.\nTwo years ago, at an evening at home, I was trying to get\ntelepathic results for one of my guests. A strange lady, whom\none of my friends had brought with her, was sitting behind me.\nI told the gentleman whose mind I was trying to read, that he\nhad that day sold a piece of land to a man named O'Brien. He\nreplied that I was wrong, as he had no land to sell. The stranger\n(a lady from Chicago whom I had never met before) said, \" That\nis very strange, for \/ sold a piece of land to-day to a man named\nO'Brien.\"\nThere was in this case no personal contact.\nOne day during the Spanish-American war, my nephew, Mr. Chase,\nand I were watching the departure of some troops for the front\nfrom the steps of a private residence. Just below us sat a little\nwoman with a faded shawl over her shoulders. I had a strong\nimpression about her, and told my nephew to ask her if her name\nwas not Smith, and if she was not born in Dumfries, Scotland.\nMr. Chase asked her name and the place of her birth, to which\nshe answered, \"Mary Smith, and I was born in Dumfries.\"\nThere was no contact in this case, but in the following the young\nwoman was brushing my hair at the time.\nI was once visiting a family named Randall, at Hustisford, Wis.,\nand was rather attracted to a pretty servant girl who used to help\nme with my hair. One day while she was with me I had a strong\n\f134 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1907.\nimpression concerning her, and asked her if her grandfather was\nnot killed while crossing a river. She said she thought not, at\nleast she had never heard of it. That night she went home to\nher mother (the daughter of a German pioneer), returning the\nnext day very much excited, and saying that her mother had told\nher it was true ; that her grandfather had been killed by the\nIndians while crossing the river with a boat-load of skins. The girl\nhad no doubt heard the story in her childhood, but had forgotten it.\nI have often turned to travelling companions and told them the\nmonth and place of their birth and have generally succeeded in\ngetting their names. But in getting names I usually begin with\nthe number of syllables, place the accent, get the initials, and then\nthe whole name. This mode of procedure would lay me open to\nthe charge of \"fishing,\" and my own experience has shown me\nthat where the \" subject \" was naturally very secretive, I have\ndepended upon clues received in this way. With a good \"subject\"\nhowever this is not necessary, and the name generally comes to\nme immediately.\nIn 1897 I was introduced to a gentleman at the Savoy Hotel in\nSan Francisco. His wife wished me to try and get his middle\nname. Upon taking his hand and closing my eyes I saw a large\nP and thought of an old friend whose name was Pettigrew. I\ntold the gentleman that his middle name was Pettigrew, and was\nnot surprised to have my guess confirmed. It is an interesting\nfact that the names of friends often help me to get the names of\nstrangers.\nA few weeks ago the local telegraph operator asked me to tell\nhim the names of his father and mother. The operator's name is\nPatteson. I took his hand, and immediately thought of a family\nof Pattersons whom I had known in girlhood. The head of the\nhouse was named William and his wife was named Jane. I\naccordingly told the operator that his father's name was William\nand his mother's name was either Jane or Jenney, to which he\nassented. (I add his testimony below.) These coincidences are of\nso frequent an occurrence that they have ceased to astonish me.\nAs to the sources of my impressions, I will say that I fully\nbelieve telepathy accounts for many but not all. I find that so\nconstant a practice has developed my powers of observation and\ninduction so that I have grown to depend upon them more and\nmore. Reading of individual character drawn from a general\nknowledge of the type represented has always been a great aid to\n\fNov., 1907. Cases. 135\nme. Moreover I believe that the \"fishing\" process may become so\nsubtile and so habitual, that, coupled with a good observation and\npowers of rapid induction, it may be used unconsciously. And I\nhave found that the majority of people are oblivious of those slight\n-clues which they invariably give me.\nA middle-aged woman, having a South German accent, came to\nme at a Church Fair where I had a booth. I noticed that she\nlooked like a Luxemberg woman I had known in Europe, that\nshe smelled slightly of carbolic acid, and that she had the assured\nair of one who earns her living. I also noted the inevitable marks\nof worry on her countenance.\nI told her that she was born in Luxemberg, was a widow, a\nprofessional supporting two daughters, one an invalid, and that\nshe had been brought up in the Catholic faith, to all of which\nshe gave a wondering assent. Why she should have had two children\ninstead of three I don't know, but all the rest was arrived at\nby observation and induction.\nA short time prior to Feb. 1893 I had some heart trouble, but\nwith that exception I have always had the best of health. When\na girl I was often followed on the street by both men and women\nwho later told me that they could not help it. And once at a\n.theatre I was admiring a lady's gown through my opera glasses.\nA few moments later the lady in question came to where I was\nseated and said that she was dominated by an impulse that she\ncould not explain. MEDORA C. ADAM.\nMessrs. J. C. Chase and Patteson corroborate Mrs. Adam's\naccount :\nI remember the episode related above by Mrs. Adam. During\nthe war with Spain we were watching the troops from a neighbor's\nsteps. My aunt told me that she had an impression regarding a\nwoman just below her, and thought her name was Smith and that\nshe was born in Dumfries. I asked the woman referred to and\nverified my aunt's impression. I do not think it possible that\nMrs. Adam could have been acquainted with these facts.\nJ. C. CHASE.\nMrs. Adam told me that my father's name was William and my\nmother's name was Jenney, which was true. As Mrs. Adam is a\nstranger to me it would have been impossible for her to have\nlearned these facts in any way.\nLEWIS W. PATTESON,\n\f136 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1907.\nL. 1165. Dreams.\nThe following case was sent to Dr. Hodgson by Mr.\nMarshall Wait, an associate of the American branch. Accounts\nof the dreams (there were two) were related before the facts\nwere known. In the first there was approximate coincidence\nin time. It will be seen that Mrs. Porter's dreams of an\naccident to her son are confirmed by her daughter and son-in-\nlaw, who heard of the dreams before the real accident was.\nknown to them. Mr. Wait writes :\n5144 MADISON AVE., CHICAGO, January 28, 1901.\nMy dear Dr. Hodgson,\u2014The enclosed statement of a repeated\ntelepathic dream is procured for me by Mr. Le Roy R. Millner,\na son-in-law of the percipient, Mrs. Porter. Mr. Millner has been\nemployed in the same office with me for a number of years, and\nas we are in the same department, we have become quite well\nacquainted. I have also met Mrs. Millner and Dr. Porter, the\nagent in the case, and talked over the case with the latter pre\nparatory to his writing me out a statement. They are all intelligent,\neducated, and conscientious people. I did not consider it necessary\nto see Mrs. Porter personally, as Mr. Millner takes considerable\ninterest in Psychical Research, has read some of our publications,\nand understands what is necessary to make a case useful for us.\nMr. Millner told me of the dreams very soon after their occurrence,\nand intended to procure the statements for me at once, but Mrs.\nPorter's husband died very suddenly a short time after, and as\nshe was already in a nervous condition from recent illness, Mr.\nMillner was unwilling to trouble her about the matter until\nrecently.\nDr. Porter sent me a rough draft of his statement to see if it\nwas what I wished, but asked for its return so that he might put\nit in more formal shape. The re-written statement he handed to-\nMr. Millner, who has unfortunately mislaid it, but he has applied\nto Dr. Porter to again write it out, and the latter has promised\nto do so. Dr. Porter says that he came to Chicago the day of\nMrs. Porter's dream. There was a celebration of some kind, either\na \" Peace Jubilee \" or a \" Dewey Celebration,\" I have forgotten\nwhich. There was a bicycle parade the first night of the celebra\ntion. Dr. Porter took a cab at the station, but found it impossible\nto pass the streets where the crowd had gathered, so dismissed his\ncab and stood watching the parade. He has no recollection of his\n\fNov., 1907. Oases. 137\naccident, but supposes that he was thrown down and trampled, as\nhe found himself early next morning wandering around the streets\nof the North Side looking for the house of Dr. Nicholas Senn,\nwith whom he studied medicine. He was painfully, though not\ndangerously, cut about the head, and, I think, had to go to a\nhospital for a couple of days. As he had come to Chicago quite\nunexpectedly, he had not notified his relatives, and as his head was\ncovered with bandages he feared to shock his mother in her nervous\ncondition, and so returned to Kalamazoo without going to see her,\nand from there wrote the first account of his accident. I believe\na closer time relation between the accident and the first dream\ncannot be established, as Mrs. Porter took no special note of the\ntime of her dream, and Dr. Porter does not know at what hour\nhe was injured. I will forward Dr. Porter's statement as soon as I\nreceive it.\u2014Yours truly,\nMARSHALL WAIT.\nMrs. Porter writes (her daughter, Mrs. Millner, also signing\nthe account) :\nNo. 299 CEYLON AVE., CHICAGO, Jany. 19, 1901.\nOn the evening of October 7, 1899, my daughter, Mrs. Millner,\nand her husband went down town to see the bicycle parade,\nleaving me at home with the children. While they were gone I\ndreamed a very distressing dream about my son Guy (who was\nliving in Kalamazoo), in which I saw him hurt in some way. When\nI woke the details of the dream were indistinct in my memory,\nbut the painful impression was very strong, although I am not a\nbeliever in dreams, and am accustomed to pay no attention to\nthem.\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Millner returned about 11 o'clock, I\nmentioned to Mrs. Millner that I had had \" such a miserable dream\nabout Guy,\" telling her the particulars as far as I remembered\nthem. A few nights after I again dreamed of my son, and this\ntime I distinctly saw him drawn out of a crowd of people and\nbadly cut. This dream I also told to Mrs. Millner before its veri\nfication. The next morning I received a letter from my son, by\nwhich I learned that he had come to Chicago on the day of the\nbicycle parade and had met with a painful accident, being badly\ncut about the head ; that he had gone to the house of a physician\nof his acquaintance, where his wounds were dressed, and that as\nhis head was covered with bandages, he had returned to Kalamazoo\n\f138 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1907.\nwithout coming to see me, fearing to shock me,' as I had recently\nbeen in poor health.\nMrs. Millner signs this with me in attestation of the fact that I\ntold her of my dreams before their verification.\nK. B. PORTER.\nMYRA B. MILLNER.\nMr. Marshall Wait supplied the subjoined further details :\n5144 MADISON AVE., CHICAGO, Feb. 20, 1901.\nDR. R. HODGSON.\nDear Sir,\u2014Enclosed herewith I forward you Dr. Porter's state\nment in the matter of his mother's telepathic dreams. The \" Wm.\nG. Porter \" of his statement is, of course, the \" Guy Porter \" of\nMrs. Porter's account. Dr. Porter always signs his full name, but\nis habitually called in the family by his middle name, Guy. . . .\nThe letters which passed between Dr. Porter and his mother\nhave been destroyed, but I have succeeded in establishing a little\ncloser time relation between the accident and the first dream. Mrs.\nPorter authorises me to say that she remembers that Mr. and\nMrs. Millner came home that evening a little after eleven, and\nthat she had been in bed but a short time when they came, so\nthat the dream occurred between ten and eleven o'clock, and cer\ntainly not before ten. You will see by the enclosed letter of Dr.\nPorter that he fixes the accident at very near ten o'clock. . . .\nMARSHALL WAIT.\nDr. Porter's statement was as follows :\n2057 WILOOX AVE., CHICAGO. ILL., Feb. %th, 1901.\nTo whom it may concern :\nOn October 7th, 1899, I left Kalamazoo, Michigan, about 4.30 p.m.\nover the Michigan Central E. R., arriving in Chicago, 111., at\n8 o'clock. I took a hack from the depot, intending to drive to\nthe Briggs Hotel. Our progress was stopped near State and Madi\nson Streets, by the crowd attending the bicycle parade of the Street\nCarnival then in progress. Owing to the intense jam I was forced\nto remain at the corner of State and Madison Streets until after\nthe parade had passed. When the crowd broke up there was a\nsevere crush, during which I lost my footing and was trampled,\nsustaining severe injuries about the head. I wandered about the\ncity in a dazed condition a considerable portion of the night, and\nat five o'clock the following morning found myself on the north\nside, several miles from where I was hurt. I inquired for and was\n\fNov., 1907. Cases. 13.9\ndirected to the residence of Dr. Nicholas Senn, the surgeon, who\nsent me to St. Joseph's Hospital, where my wounds were dressed\nat 9 o'clock. I passed the next day at a hotel (the Briggs House)\nand did not communicate with my relatives, fearing lest my bad\nappearance and bandaged head might prove a shock to my mother,\nwho was in a very low physical condition at the time. I returned\nto Kalamazoo on the following afternoon, and was in bed about\ntwo weeks. On my partial recovery I wrote my mother of the\naccident in response to a letter from her, in which she stated that\nshe had a dream on the night of the 7th of October, to the effect\nthat I was hurt and in trouble. This letter to my mother was the\nfirst actual knowledge she had either of my trip to Chicago or my\ninjury. I also understand from her that she had another dream\nthe night before she received my letter, in which she saw me\ndrawn from a crowd wounded and bleeding.\nMy injuries consisted of severe cuts and bruises on the face and\nneck, which bled freely. I sustained a slight concussion of the\nbrain, which was overcome by two weeks of quiet.\nMy trip to Chicago was made suddenly and without notification\nto any of my relatives or friends. My mother's first dream coincided\nwith the date on which I was hurt, and her second dream coincided\nwith the day on which my letter to her was mailed. She received\nit, I believe, the following day. WM. G. PORTER, M.D.\nMr. Wait also obtained corroboration from Mr. Millner as\nfollows :\nCHICAGO, ILL.\nI heard of both of Mrs. Porter's dreams of her son's accident\nbefore their verification from my wife, but not from Mrs. Porter\nherself.

I will gladly\ntell you everything about the dream mentioned in the papers.\nMonday night (Jan. 2nd) I dreamed that the local undertaker\nhere brought the dead body of my brother, Huntley Wells Caldwell,\ninto my house in a coffin. I saw him (my brother) very distinctly\nin the dream. The coffin seemed to be open, and I saw his still\nwhite form as they carried him into the house.\nIn the morning I told my husband about the dream, but he only\nlaughed, saying : \" Perhaps Huntly would get married, as dreams\nusually go by contraries.\"\nThen about nine o'clock he left the house for his office, and\nabout fifteen minutes after his departure the telegram came,\nannouncing the death of my brother.\nI dressed hurriedly and hastened to the office to show the tele\ngram to Mr. Pool, and the first words he uttered were : \" Mercy !\nthat's your dream.\"\nI left here on the afternoon train for Los Angeles, as my brother\nwas buried there. He died suddenly without any illness. His\ndeath occurred Monday night, and I received the telegram Tuesday\nmorning.\n(Signed) MRS. WM. H. POOL.\nMr. Pool wrote to Dr. Hodgson :\nSANTA KOSA, CAL., Aug. 7th, 1905.\nDear Sir,\u2014Referring to yours of the 27th ult., wherein you ask\nme to give you a few lines in confirmation of the facts concerning\nthe most remarkable dream Mrs. Pool had the night before she\nreceived the telegram informing her of her brother's death at Los\nAngeles, some four hundred miles south of this city\u2014the facts as\nI remember them are as follows :\nMrs. Pool, upon arising in the morning about seven o'clock,\nrelated to me that she had dreamed that her brother (Huntley Wells\nCaldwell) had died, and that she saw distinctly the undertaker, a\nMr, Stanley, bringing the body into the parlour enclosed in a\n\fNov., 1907.

The dream seemed to impress her very much, but I, being\nsceptical of such matters as dreams \" coming true,\" passed the\nincident with the remark that, as dreams have the opposite meaning,\nprobably Huntley was to be married. As customary, I went to\nmy office here, and shortly after arriving there, about 9 o'clock\na.m., Mrs. Pool rushed in and tossed the telegram upon my desk,\nsaying: \"It is true! It is true! He is dead.\" Upon taking up\nthe telegram, I read : \" Huntley died last night. Mamma.\"\nHuntley Wells Caldwell was a writer of much talent, and wrote\nunder the nom de plume of \"Huntley C. Wells,\" and some of his\nrecent articles were upon the Mormon question, and were published\nin the New York papers, the World being one of them, I believe.\nHe was a strong believer in psychological phenomena, and firmly\nbelieved that telepathy was not a fiction. Mrs. Pool also coincided\nto a certain extent with his ideas in these matters. The writer\nhowever having his time much occupied with business matters, has\nnot studied along these lines, but must confess that this dream, if\nnot a strong testimonial of the beliefs held by Mrs. Pool and her\nbrother, was indeed a most remarkable coincidence.\nWILLIAM H. POOL.\nFurther letter from Mrs. Pool to Dr. Hodgson :\nSANTA ROSA, CAL., Aug. 12ih, 1905.\nDear Sir,\u2014Your letter of July 27th received, which I handed\nto my husband to answer. He has written what he remembers of\nthe circumstances connected with the dream I had about my\nbrother's death, and I enclose the same to you.\nThere are a few little incidents that occurred a short time\nbefore his death that may be of interest to you, and which I\nbelieve I did not mention in my previous letter. For about two\nweeks (or perhaps a little longer) before he died I had an un\naccountable desire to dress in black. Many times when I would\ngo to the closet to select a dress something seemed to urge me to\nselect a black one. One day I unconsciously dressed myself entirely\nin black, and did not notice it until about half a block from the\nhouse. Then, with something of a shock, I realised I was dressed\nin mourning. Black from head to foot ! I turned back home, and\nremoved a black ribbon I had around my neck, and replaced it\nwith a bright-coloured one; but I remained- depressed all day. I\nseemed to come to myself with a shock when I noticed the black\ngarments. Unconsciously I had selected every article black ; that\n\f142 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1907.\nis, I did not notice it as I put them on. And for many days\nbefore he died the first garment to come to my hand would be a\nblack one. This rather annoyed me at times, as I do not care for\nblack ; but I never for a moment connected these things with any\nfuture events. I simply look back to them now.\nAnother thing. About a week before he died I was lying in\nbed quite wakeful\u2014could not go to sleep, in fact (a very unusual\noccurrence for me, as I sleep well). I had been lying wide awake\nfor some time when all at once I had the most dreadful sensation\npass through me. It seemed to be a horrible chill, a feeling like\nice that seemed to pass through my whole body, and make me\nquiver from head to foot. It was almost an agony, so horrible was\nit while it lasted. At the same time I cried out: \"Oh! Huntley!\"\nThe next day, while busy with my household duties, I had the\nsame sensation ; but I did not utter his name. Both times that\nterrible sensation left ine very weak, almost exhausted, although it\nlasted only a few minutes.\nI cannot find the telegram I received from Mamma announcing\nmy brother's death, although I have spent several days looking for\nit. But should I come across it at any time I will send it to you.\nI remain, sincerely yours, (Signed) MRS. WM. H. POOL.\nL. 1167. Dream.\nThe following case is that of a premonitory dream. It\nwas sent to Dr. Hodgson by Mr. G. W. C. Krebs. The dream\nwas related on the morning after it took place to the mother\nand grandmother of the child to whom it referred. The\nfulfilment occurred about a fortnight later.\nThe weak point is that the child was evidently in the\nhabit of crossing a dangerous street without supervision, and\nthe uncle may have noticed this.\nThe subjoined letter of Mr. Krebs has three corroborative\nsignatures attached :\nBALTIMORE, Nov. 2tth, 1902.\nDear Doctor,\u2014In response to your favor of the 18th enclosing\ncutting describing an alleged premonitory dream by Charles Nolte\nof this city, and requesting me to make inquiries about the case,\nI send the following as the result of my investigation :\nMr. Charles Nolte, residing at 1503 Bank Street, an intelligent\n\fNov., 1907.

Thiemeyer & Co. on\nCaroline Street, one night about the first part of November had a\nvery vivid and distressing dream.\nIn this dream the following scene occurred : while on his return\nfrom work in the afternoon, about 5.30 o'clock, he distinctly saw\nhis sister's little daughter Helen, a very sweet and bright child of\nthree summers, a special favorite of her grandmother Mrs. Nolte,\ncrossing the street in front of her own home, 408 S. Caroline Street,\non her way to see her grandma, apparently in the best of health,\nactive, sprightly and full of glee as usual. At the same time, to\nliis horror, Mr. Nolte saw a rapidly approaching trolley car, of\nwhich she appeared to be entirely unaware. In his anguish at her\nperilous situation, he could only call out to warn her, being unable\nto move a muscle, and completely paralysed for the instant, strong\nman though he was, and compelled to witness a scene he would\ncheerfully have risked his life to prevent.\nUnnerved and distressed, he then awoke, greatly relieved to find\nit was only a dream.\nThe first thing he did in the morning, after leaving his room,\nwas to relate the terrible dream to his mother, who was so\nimpressed with the recital that she immediately went over to her\ndaughter's, Mrs. John Liebig, and, after relating the dream, insisted\nthat her grandchild should have extra care taken of her, so that\nno harm could possibly befall the little one.\nAccident: on Thursday afternoon, November 13th, at 5.30 o'clock\nas Mrs. John Liebig's little daughter 'Helen, aged three years, was\ncrossing the street in front of her home, on her way to her grand\nmother's, she was struck by a trolley car, and in a few minutes\nthereafter expired.

Cases innumerable could be pointed out, going to\nprove that animals are possessed of second sight or an extra sense,\nwhich reveals the grisly supernormal to them, when human beings\nsee nothing.\nFinally, the noises heard in the vault, and which first attracted\nattention to it, with the horse-fright, can hardly be accounted for by\nrising water displacement of the coffins, which would be more or\nless noiseless and gradual, unless a modified maelstrom is supposed\nto have been at work in the vault.\nAs a humble student of metapsychic phenomena one is, of course,\nfamiliar with \" explanations \" of all kinds re supernormal phenomena.\nThese \" explanations \" generally assume the witnesses of inexplicable\nphenomena to be devoid of the simplest powers of correct observation.\nBut the above explanation goes one better than most I have come\nacross, in its sublime indifference to the trammels of circumstance.\nI can only suppose that Count Petrovo-Solovovo was ignorant of\nthe circumstances, or that he was actuated by a pardonable desire\nto close an incident obnoxious to the Buxhoewden family. \" The\nmatter had been hushed up at the time through the influence of the\nfamily.\" (K.D.O.

MYERS AT CHELTENHAM\nCOLLEGE.\nTHE members of the Society will be glad to hear that the\nMemorial to Mr. Myers proposed early last year, of which an\naccount appeared in the Journal for May, 1906, has been\ncompleted.\nOn All Saints' Day, November 1st last, a memorial and\ndedication service was held in the College Chapel. There was\na crowded congregation of subscribers to the Memorial and past\nand present students of the College. Among those present\nwere Mrs. F. W. H. Myers, Miss Myers, Mr. L. H. Myers,\nMr. Ernest Myers, Sir Oliver and Lady Lodge, General Sir\nEeginald and Lady Hart, Mr. and Mrs. Bruce-Pryce, Mr. L.\nGumming (Rugby), Mr. D. Amphlett (Edgbaston), Miss Sturge\n(Ladies' College), Mr. A. S. Owen (Oxford), and Eev. A. T.\nFryer (Cardiff).\nSir Oliver Lodge delivered an address on \" The Communion\nof Saints,\" which he denned as \" a fellowship of all the beings\nwho help and love each other ; some of them known to us,\nothers at present unknown.\"\nIf any man had profound and living belief in this doctrine\n{he said) it was the man whom we are now commemorating,\nin whose honour a Memorial has been erected by friends in\nthis place of early study, and whose spirit is certainly with\nus this day.\nAt one time, to his sceptical mind, annihilation seemed the\nprobable doom both of the individual and of the race ; and\nit was his instinctive rebellion against any such ghastly con\nclusion that constituted the motive power which so greatly\ninfluenced contemporaries, and has probably left an impress\nupon the world for all time. It became his life study to find\na scientific proof of the immortality of the soul, and thus to\nvindicate the meaning and intention of the Creator.\nSuch scientific proof, in his own judgment and in the judg\nment of some of his co-workers, he was ultimately privileged\nto find. By critical and comprehensive and truly scientific\nstudy of weird and ultra-normal facts in human nature, which\nhe strung together and illustrated in an ingenious and powerful\n\fDeo., 1907. Memorial to Mr. Myers. 149\nmanner, he gradually rose, after years of doubt and hesitation,\nto a sublime and living faith in the divine ordering of the\nuniverse and its harmony with the highest aspirations of man.\nThis belief was based in the first instance on the results of\nscientific investigation, but it ascended into the atmosphere\nof religion itself; and by its beacon light it did much to\nkindle a like faith and enthusiasm among the ranks of those\nwho otherwise might have held aloof from an unpopular and\napparently unpromising region of inquiry.\nI shall now speak largely for myself, and try to represent\nvery briefly our present position with respect to a surviving\npersonal existence. I want to make the distinct assertion that\nno really existing thing perishes, but only changes its form.\nPhysical science teaches us this clearly enough concerning matter\nand energy\u2014the two great entities with which it has to do.\nAnd there is no likelihood of any great modification in this\nteaching. It may, perhaps, be induced in the long run to\nmodify the form of statement and to assert conservation and\nreal existence of Ether and Motion\u2014or, perhaps, of only Ether\nin motion\u2014rather than of matter and energy. That is quite\npossible ; but the apparent variation of statement is only a\nvariant in form ; its essence and meaning are the same, except\nthat it is now more general, and would allow even the atoms\nof matter themselves to have their day and cease to be\u2014being\nresolved, perhaps, into electricity, and that into some hitherto\nunimagined mode of motion of the ether. But these details\nneed not here be considered. The distinction between what\nis temporary and what is permanent is quite clear. Evanes\ncence is to be stated concerning every kind of \" system \" and\naggregation and grouping. A crowd assembles and then it.\ndisperses ; it is a crowd no more. A cloud forms in the sky,\nand soon once more the sky is blue again ; the cloud has died.\nDew forms on a leaf, a little while and it has gone again\u2014\ngone, apparently, into nothingness like the cloud. But we\nknow better. In an imperceptible form it was, and soon into\nan imperceptible form it will again have passed, but meanwhile\nthere is the dewdrop glistening in the sun, reflecting all the\nmovements of the neighbouring world and contributing its\nlittle share to the beauty and the serviceableness of creation.\nIts perceptible or incarnate existence is temporary. As a\n\f150 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec., 1907.\ndrop it was born, and as a drop it dies ; but as aqueous\nvapour it persists, an intrinsically imperishable natural sub\nstance. Even it, therefore, has the attribute of immortality.\nSo, then, what about life ? Can that be a nonentity which\nhas built up particles of carbon and hydrogen and oxygen\ninto the form of an oak or an eagle or a man ? Is it some\nthing which is really nothing, and soon shall it be manifestly\nthe nothing that an ignorant and purblind creature may suppose\nit to be ? Not so, nor is it so with mind and consciousness\nand will, nor with memory and love and adoration, nor all the\nmanifold activities which at present strangely interact with\nmatter and appeal to our bodily senses and terrestrial know\nledge ; they are not nothing, nor shall they ever vanish into\nnothingness or cease to be. They did not arise with us, they\nnever did spring into being, they are as eternal as the Godhead\nitself, and in the Eternal Being they shall endure for ever. But,\nthen, what about personality, individuality, our own character\nand self? Are those things akin to the temporary groupings\nwhich shall be dissolved, or are they among the substantial\nrealities that shall endure ?\nEven the life of an insect or a tree may, in some sort\u2014must,\nas I think, in some sort\u2014persist, but surely not its personal\ncharacter ! Why not ? Because it has none. I cannot imagine\nthat such a thing has any individuality or personality ; it\nappears to us to be merely one of a group, a mere unit in\na world of being, without personality of its own. At any rate,\nthat is what I shall assume ; and it is clear that what does\nnot exist will not persist. How can it ? We may at once\nadmit that for all those things which only share in a general\nlife, that general life will return undifferentiated and unidentified\nto its central store : just as happens in the better understood\ncategories of matter and energy.\nThat is simple enough. But suppose that some individual\ncharacter, some personality, does exist : suppose that not only\nlife, but intellect and emotion and consciousness and will are\nall associated with a certain physical organism ; and suppose\nthat these things have a real and undeniable existence, an\nexistence strengthened and compacted by experience and suffer\ning and joy, till it is no longer only a member of the material\naggregate in which for a time it is embodied, but belongs to\n\fDec., 1907. Memorial to Mr. Myers. 1 51\na universe of spirit closely related to immanent and tran\nscendent Deity : what then ? If all that really exists is\nimmortal, we have only to ask whether our personality, our\ncharacter, our self, is sufficiently individual, sufficiently charac\nteristic, sufficiently developed, sufficiently real ; for if it is,\nthere can then be no doubt of its continuance.\nIn a remarkable book on the Philosophy of Religion, Professor\nHoffding, of Copenhagen, develops a theory of importance, which\nhe calls the conservation of value. He teaches that what he\ncalls the axiom of \" the conservation of value \" is the funda\nmental ingredient in all religions\u2014the foundation without which\nnone of them could stand. In his view, as a philosopher,\nagreeing therein with Browning and other poets, no real value\nor good is ever lost. The whole progress and course of evolution\nis to increase and intensify the valuable\u2014that which \" avails \"\nor is serviceable for highest purposes\u2014and it does so by bring\ning out that which was potential or latent so as to make it\nactual and real. Eeal it was no doubt all the time in some\nsense, as an oak is implicit in an acorn, or a flower in a bud,\nbut in process of time it unfolds itself and adds to the value\nof the universe. This is the meaning of evolution.\nValue must either be conserved, says Professor Hoffding, or\nit must increase. Our experience of evolution suggests that\nit must increase. Certainly it passes from latent to more\nmanifest forms ; and though it sometimes swings back, yet, on\nthe whole, progress seems upward. Is it not legitimate to\nconjecture that while matter and energy are conserved\u2014neither\nincreasing nor decreasing, but only changing in form\u2014and while\nlife, too, perhaps, is constant in quantity, though alternating\ninto and out of incarnation according as material vehicles are\nput together or worn out, yet that some of the higher attributes\nof existence\u2014love, shall we say, joy perhaps, what may be\ngeneralised as good generally, or as availability or value\u2014may\nactually increase ; their apparent alternations being really the\ncurves of an upward tending spiral ? It is an optimistic faith,\nbut it is the faith of the poets and seers. Whatever evil days\nmay fall upon an individual or a nation, or even sometimes on\na whole planet, yet the material is subordinate to the spiritual;\nand if the spiritual persists, it cannot be stationary: it must\nsurely rise in the scale of existence. From this point of view\n\f152 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec., 1907.\nthe law of evolution is that Good shall on the whole increase\nin the universe, with the process of the suns : that immortality\nitself is a special case of a more general law\u2014namely, that in\nthe whole universe nothing really finally perishes that is worth\nkeeping, that a thing once attained is not thrown away. There\nis no real waste, no real loss, no annihilation ; but everything\nsufficiently valuable, be it personality, beauty, artistic achieve\nment, knowledge, unselfish affection, endures henceforth and for\never, not only with an individual and personal existence, but\nas part of the eternal Being of God.\nWhether or not this incipient theory of the conservation\nof value stand the test of criticism, it is undeniable that seers\ndo not hesitate to attribute permanence and timeless existence\nto the essential element in man himself. You remember the\neloquent words of Carlyle :\n\" What, then, is man ? What, then, is man ? He endures\nfor but an hour, and is crushed before the moth. Yet in the\nbeing and in the working of a faithful man is there already\n(as all faith, from the beginning, gives assurance), a something\nthat pertains not to this wild death-element of Time ; that\ntriumphs over Time, and is, and will be, when Time shall be\nno more.\"\nFor, ai'ter all, there is a unity running through the universe,\nand a kinship between the human and the divine. \" All\nomens,\" says Myers, \" point towards the steady continuance\nof just such labour as has already taught us all we know.\nPerhaps, indeed, in this complex of interpenetrating spirits our\nown effort is no individual, no transitory, thing. That which\nlies at the root of each of us lies at the root of the Cosmos,\ntoo. Our struggle is the struggle of the universe itself; and\nthe very Godhead finds fulfilment through our upward-striving\nsouls \" (Myers' Human Personality).\nEeverting to his previous words that Friendship and Faculty\nwill survive bodily death and affection bridge the chasm, Sir\nOliver concluded with an exposition of the deceased's investi\ngations into the problem, culminating in his belief that this\nlife is but a stage towards a higher life, a type of which may\nyet be seen upon this earth.\n\fDec., 1907.

Mrs. C. dreamed two nights\nrunning that Mrs. A. was trying to induce her (Mrs. A.'s)\nhusband to lend money to Mr. B. ; she wrote to Mrs. A.\nwarning her to desist. Mr. B. was unknown to Mrs. C.\nDR. HODGSON'S informant wrote :\nNEW YORK, Mar. 20, '93.\nMy dear Sir,\u2014I am a member of the Society for Psychical Research,\nand have followed your work for some time with much interest.\nI am a sceptic but a seeker after knowledge.\nMany strange tales reach me, which I have usually been able to\nattribute to diseased brains.\nI present you herewith a story which differs from any that I\nhave yet heard. One distinguishing feature is that there is docu\nmentary evidence available to prove the truth of the essential parts.\nMoreover 'it is of very recent occurrence.\nMr. A. is a gentleman of unquestioned character and standing.\nI have known him well for twenty years. He is unusually careful\nin his statements\u2014is not given to any \"isms,\" and is not a believer\nin spiritualism. I have his permission to give you this story to be\nused as you see fit, upon the condition that no names shall be given\nexcept to you personally.\nIf an interview with him is desired, an appointment can doubtless\nbe made by addressing me. Mr. A. has written to the lady in\nColorado asking on what nights the dream occurred. You will\nnotice from the dates given that there is a fair presumption that\nthey occurred on the nights of March 9th and 10th or llth, the\nprecise nights when Mrs. A. was most intently considering the\nproposed loan.\nAs far as Mr. A. knows, neither Mr. B. nor Mrs. C. so much as\nknows of the existence of the other. Mr. A. says that he knows\nMrs C. to be a lady of the very highest character.\nThe following general statement of the case was enclosed in\nthe above :\nMarch 9th, 1893, Mr. A. (a business man engaged in business in\nNew York) received a letter from a friend (Mr. B.) dated 8th,\n\f154 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec., 1907.\nasking for a considerable loan required to relieve his business from\nembarrassment. Mr. A. took the letter to his house in a suburban\ntown, and showed it to his wife on the evening of the 9th, asking\nher advice. Between the desire on one hand to oblige a friend,\nand on the other reluctance to risk a large sum of money, the\nsubject became one of serious importance and consideration for\nsome days.\nMrs. A. has a friend living in Colorado, whom we will call\nMrs. 0. They were schoolmates and have maintained a mail corre\nspondence to the present time, the exchange of letters being not\nfrequent. Recently (say about the last of February) Mrs. A. received\na letter from the son of Mrs. C. to the effect that his mother was\nill and unable to write.\nOn March 14th Mrs. A. received a letter from Mrs. C., in which,\nafter apologising for writing upon such a subject, she says that at\nthe risk of being laughed at she must write to tell her of a dream\nthat she has had \" twice in succession.\" She relates the dream, in\nwhich she saw Mrs. A. pacing up and down in a room in her\nhouse troubled in mind about a loan she was thinking of making.\nA voice came to Mrs. C. saying, write and tell her not to lend the\nmoney. She will regret it.\nMrs. C.'s letter was written apparently while she was still ill,\nand it was with difficulty she found strength to write. The letter\nreferred to no other subject.\nDr. Hodgson's informant further wrote :\nNEW YORK, March 24, 1893.\nDear Sir,\u2014Your letter of 21st inst. is at hand. In response I\nsend herewith a statement written by Mr. A. in his own hand, but\nto which, for personal reasons, he is unwilling to affix his signature.\nHis statement embodies a copy of the letter from Mrs. C. The\noriginal of Mrs. C.'s letter I have seen and carefully compared\nwith this copy made by Mr. A., and certify to its being accurately\ntranscribed. Mr. A. is not willing to permit the original letter from\nMrs. C. to leave his possession.\nMy original statement of this case I find was not quite accurate\nin two particulars, which may be immaterial, but it is well to be\nexact. First, peculiar personal relations had much more to do with\nthe question of making the loan than friendship or pecuniary risk.\nOn this account Mrs. A.'s mind was more intently occupied in con\nsidering the matter than would have been the case otherwise.\nSecond, Mrs. A. and Mrs. C. were not schoolmates, but formed\ntheir acquaintance while taking music lessons from the same teacher,\nsay fifteen years or more ago.\nYou will note that in Mrs. C.'s dream Mrs. A. was \" quite\ninclined towards the transaction.\" Mr. A. says this is correct. It\nis probably also correct that Mrs. A. wore a \" lace scarf about her\nhead,\" though of this she cannot be certain. Mrs. C. had seen\nMrs. A. wearing such a scarf a year or so ago.\n\fDec., 1907. Cases. 155\nMr. A. says that Mrs. A. thinks it is certain that Mrs. C. has\nnever heard of Mr. B. Mrs. A. also feels certain that nothing she\n(Mrs. A.) has ever said to Mrs. C. could convey the information or\nsuggestion that she was likely to be asked for a loan by any one.\nNo reply has as yet been received by Mrs. A. from Mrs. C. as\nto the exact dates of the dream.\nI regret that the circumstances are such as to preclude the use\nof names in this case. I am willing to endorse fully Mr. A.'s state\nments upon my knowledge of his character.\nMr. A. wrote :\nNEW YORK, March 24, 1893.\nOn the 9th of March, 1893, I received from Mr. B. a letter dated\nMarch 8th, 1893, asking for a loan of a considerable sum of money.\nThe circumstances in the case called for very careful consideration,\nand certain peculiar personal relations to Mr. B. and his family\nconnections made it important to have the advice and opinion of\nmy wife. I therefore showed Mr. B.'s letter to her, and asked her\nto think about it for a day or two, which she did, and talked with\nme on the subject on the evening of March 9th, and also from\ntime to time on the 10th, llth, 12th, and 13th of March.\nOn the 14th of March she received from a friend\u2014Mrs. C.\u2014\nliving in a Western town about 2000 miles from New York, a letter\ndated and posted March llth, 1893, as follows:\n\" My dear Mrs. A.,\u2014Although still confined to my bed as I\nwrote you, and finding it a physical difficulty to write, a dream of\nyou, which has come to me two successive nights, is so real I must\ntranscribe it to you, however lightly you may choose to consider it,\nand I beg your generous heart to pardon any presumption which\nmay appear in my making sufficient of it to send you a description.\n\"I saw you walking meditatively up and down a path in your\nhome, with a lace scarf about your head, considering a loan of\nwhich you were contemplating the making. You were quite\ninclined to the transaction, but a voice kept saying to me, ' She\nwill regret it\u2014tell her not to. It will lead to grief for her, and\nfor many reasons be a mistake.'\n\"My dear friend of the olden and the present time, laugh if you\nwill, but accept the interest and affection which prompt my writing,\nand with love to your household, believe me ever your faithful\nfriend,\n\"[Mrs.] C.\"\nMrs. C. has not been East within the past six months.\nI have the best reason to believe that she has never seen Mr. B.\nnor any of his family relatives or connections. My wife is quite\npositive that she never mentioned him nor any of his connections\nto Mrs. C., and that Mrs. C. does not know of his existence.\n\f1 56 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Haunted House.\nThe Secretary of the Society went to see Mr. Veran (the\nname is fictitious), the tenant of this house, a greengrocer's shop,\non October 15th, 1907, and obtained statements from the\ntenant, his wife and three servants. The statements were taken\ndown from dictation and are in the words of the witnesses them\nselves, but they contain answers put to them in cross-examination\nby the Secretary, as well as their own spontaneous accounts of\nwhat happened. A tradesman living next door confirmed the\nstory to some extent, although he was sceptical as to many\nof the alleged facts ; but he was unwilling to sign any statement.\nMr. Veran said :\nWe came in here in the beginning of September.\nTo begin with, the servant complained as to noises. 29th Septem\nber, twenty [minutes] to twelve [midnight], I heard a terrible noise\nin the kitchen, and thought some one was breaking in. I listened for\nsome time, and it got more serious. The bells, which are discon\nnected with any place where they could be tampered with, began to\nring furiously. I and the man (Bert) and a policeman went to the\nkitchen, and found no one. A noise like rapping on the wall con\ntinued after we were in the basement. There are stables next door,\nwhich might account for some of the noise. This was the only night\nI heard the noises. My wife heard the bells on October 10th, at\n5 a.m., so did the servant.\nWhen the shop was being fitted up for me, Mrs. M., who was\ncleaning the place up, heard inexplicable noises. She and a shop-\nfitter found the man's bedroom locked, but there were footsteps\ninside ; the man [the shopfittei'] said, \" Come out, mate ; we won't\ntouch you ; the place is empty.\" He eventually broke open the door,\nand found no one there.\nThe doors open of their own accord, and we hear the latch go,\nthough we don't see the handle turn. M}' brother-in-law has heard\nthe tapping on the door and seen a door open. The dog has got\nquite thin since. JOHN VERAN.\nMrs. Veran's statement was :\nOn 3rd October, at 4.30 a.m., I heard footsteps coming down\nstairs, and the dog barking, and I holloaed out, but there was no\nanswer, and my door came open. I went to see who opened my\ndoor. I saw a woman in black, with sharp features and a large\nblack hat. I screamed, and she vanished. On the 4th October,\nat 3 p.m., I was lying on the couch in the dining-room. I heard,\ntapping at the door, and then she came up in a cloud, dressed as\nbefore, beside the couch. I was wide awake and terrified. I have\nseen her on several occasions since. She has touched me twice.\nOnce she shoved me in my husband's presence (October 8th), but\n\fDec., 1907. Cases. 157\nwe neither of us saw her (in the dining-room). I won't stop here.\nIt would drive me mad. We never heard any stories about the\nhouse till after this happened. The apparition seems to come from\nthe bath-room. The butcher next door seems to know about the\nbath-room, but won't say what he knows. He recognises the\napparition as the wife of the previous tenant.\nOn 4th October, between 4 a.m. and 5 a.m., I was going to call\nMaggie. I was feeling nervous, because of the day before, and I\nsaw a man brush by me. His hair was brushed up, and his shirt\nsleeves were tucked up. He took no notice of me. After that I\nwould not sleep in the house for a week.\nOn October 13th, at supper, a piece of bread was thrown\nviolently to the floor, wide of the table. I couldn't eat any supper\nafterwards. MAY VERAN.\nThe maid-servant stated :\nI only heard footsteps (a man's) on the bottom stairs first (5th\nSeptember), but I thought it was next door. The second time I\nthought it was the man, but he had not come. The first time I\nsaw it was 5th October. I was going upstairs with a tray, at\nabout 1 a.m., and saw the back of a woman, like a nun, all in\nblack. She seemed to be going in to the dining-room. I was\nfrightened, and put the tray down and ran downstairs. I have not\nseen her since. I have neither seen nor heard anything else.\nMAGGIE\nThe two men-assistants in the shop stated :\nOn the Wednesday the bells rang twice. Bert and I were in\nthe kitchen, then I heard X. scream, and she came almost fainting\ndownstairs, and I went up the stairs, and saw a tallish woman in\na black dress and big hat. That's all I have seen, but I have\nheard walking. And there's more noise than ever in the bath-room.\nCHARLES\nI came here a week before my master, and heard mysterious\nnoises, but took no notice of it, and did not mention it. Then\non the Sunday the bells began to ring, and there was no one\nthere. On the Wednesday after the bells rang again ; we were in\nthe kitchen, between 9 and 10. Soon after this the servant started\nscreaming. I found her nearly fainting on the stairs. As the\nother man came up the stairs, I saw the vision glide past me up\nthe stairs. I did not mention it to the other man, but lie told\nme about it, for he had seen her too, when I got back to the\nkitchen. I've not seen it since. While the mistress was away it\nwas all quiet, since she came back it has begun again. The last\ntime I heard the footsteps was last week. Altogether I have heard\nthe footsteps quite half-a-dozen times. BKRT\nOn analysing the evidence, one observes at once that the\nfirst phenomena were the most simple and the most easy to\n\f158 Journal of Society for Psychical Research, Dec., 1007.\naccount for. Mice and rats are frequently responsible for the\nunnecessary ringing of bells, and the noises which horses in an\nadjoining stable can produce at night are many and varied. It\nseems not unlikely that the effect of these noises on the mind\nof the wife of the tenant was sufficient to account for the\napparition which she saw. At least it was evident afterwards\nthat she had got into a very nervous condition. Nor must\none forget that although she and her husband appear honestly\nconvinced that they had heard no traditions with regard to\nthe house previously, it is always very difficult to say after\nthe event the particular dates on which rumours have\nbeen heard. Indeed, it seems extremely likely that the\nstories regarding the ringing of the bells and other noises\nwere discussed by the neighbours, who could hardly have\nrefrained from giving an explanation in accord with what\nthey knew of previous tenants.\nThe husband's evidence is not of great importance, as he,\nat any rate, did not see an apparition. The evidence of the\nservants is at first sight more impressive, as they apparently\ndid see something. But Maggie had clearly got into a very\nnervous state\u2014partly through the noises, and partly through\nhearing of her mistress's previous experiences\u2014before she saw\nthe figure, while the testimony of the two men did not strike\nthe Secretary as being given with absolute sincerity.\nThe case then appears on the whole to be an excellent instance\nof the way in which a ghost story may grow up from very\nslender foundations, so that if it is not examined from the\nvery beginning, the signed evidence eventually obtainable\nwould appear almost conclusive of some supernormal agency.\nCOEEESPONDENCE.\nTHE ARENSBURG POLTERGEIST.\n(To the Editor of the JOURNAL S.P.R.)\nNovember 16th, 1907.\nSIR,\nMay I be permitted a few comments on Mr. Govett's letter\non the Arensburg Poltergeist, which appears in the current number\nof the Journal.\nMr. Govett objects to the phrase used in the October Journal\n\fDec., 1907. Correspondence. 159\nthat Count Solovovo's explanation\u2014that the disturbances were\ncaused by underground water\u2014seems to account satisfactorily for\nall the facts of the case. I retain the italics, which are Mr. Govett's\nown, as they serve to emphasise my first point, namely\u2014that Mr.\nGovett fails, as it seems to me, to distinguish between \"facts\" and\nthird-hand or even more remote testimony for facts, and it is\napparently Count Solovovo's endeavour to preserve this distinction\nthat has brought him under the ban of Mr. Govett.\nI believe that the sole authority for the story of the Arensburg\nPoltergeist (until Count Solovovo obtained some confirmation of it\nfrom the Buxhoewden family) was Dale Owen. Owen's account\ncame from the daughter and son of Baron von Guldenstubbe, who\nhad heard it from their father. Their account is therefore second\nhand, and Owen's version third-hand. Not only so, but Baron von\nGuldenstubbe himself is only stated to have witnessed the dis\narrangement of the coffins and the precautions taken to preclude\nhuman agency, and to have drawn up the official account of these\nevents\u2014the existence of which account, by the way, careful\nenquiries have failed to substantiate. (See Journal S.P.R., February,\n1907.)\nThe supplementary details of horses being frightened and of noises\nbeing heard in the vault are not said to be contained in the official\naccount, nor are they vouched for by Baron von Guldenstubbe.\nThat is, they are not related even at third-hand, and are obviously\nrumours of a kind which we know from long experience tend to\naccrete round such narratives. I think, then, that the term \"facts\"\nmay fairly be confined to what is contained in the official account,\nas described by Owen.\nThe letter printed in the October Journal affords strong evidence,\nwhich Mr. Govett practically ignores, that as a matter of fact in\nthis particular cemetery water does sometimes occur in the vaults,\nand that coffins have been found actually floating in them\u2014head\ndownwards, like the coffins in Owen's narrative. The discovery may\nhave been first made some time later than 1844, the date of the\nPoltergeist.\nDisturbances of coffins from the same cause are not unknown in\nother places\u2014e.g. a case has occurred recently at the Edgware\nParish Church. The Times of August 3rd, 1907, reports a sitting\nof the Consistory Court of London, at which a petition was pre\nsented by the vicar and churchwardens of the parish of Edgware\nfor a faculty to authorise the removal of human remains buried\nunder the church. It was stated that under the centre of the\nchurch and under the transepts was an almost continuous series of\nbrick graves, having large flagstones on the top. The graves were\nfound to be filled with water to the depth of 4 ft. to 6 ft., in\nwhich some of the coffins and decayed bones were floating.\nOf the theory that the Arensburg coffins were disturbed by water\nMr. Govett says : \" The occurrences took place in the middle of\nsummer, not in autumn or spring, when the Grundwasser wells up.\"\nI think\u2014to quote Mr. Govett's own words\u2014\" the writer of this\n\f160 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec., 1907. '\nparagraph cannnot surely have read Dale Owen's account, or he\nwould scarcely have made such a statement.\"\nAccording to Owen, the first time the coffins were found dis\narranged was after (he does not say how long after) the interment\nof a member of the Buxhoewden family who had died \" about the\nsame time \" that a complaint was made to the Consistory ; namely,\nat some time (unspecified) after eleven horses had \" one day in the\ncourse of July \" had a panic in the cemetery. This is Owen's\nnearest approach to the mention of any particular time of year\nwhen the coffins were disturbed. The other occasions took place\nlater, and from the narrative would seem to have extended over a\nconsiderable period, probably well into the autumn.\nMr. Govett remarks further that the water must have appeared\nand disappeared, in the first case, during the short period between\nthe burial and the discovery of the confusion of coffins. But there\nis nothing in Owen's account to show that the confusion had not\ntaken place long before it was discovered by those three or four\nbold spirits who ventured to examine the vault on this occasion.\nAs to the wood-ashes strewn over the pavement, the effect of\nwater rising and subsiding again would probably have been, if\nanything, to make their surface smoother than before.\nMr. Govett lays special stress on the \"strange terror of horses\nin the vicinity,\" and observes that \" cases innumerable could be\npointed out, going to prove that animals are possessed of second\nsight.\" I would remind him that not one of these cases comes to us\nat first-hand, and\u2014so far as I can remember\u2014in no single case (with\nthe doubtful exception of Balaam's ass) did the second-hand reporter\nhimself receive a verbal account from the percipient. Here again\nI would urge that the distinction should be maintained between\nfacts and second-hand testimony about or inference from facts.\nFinally, Mr. Govett \"can only suppose that Count Petrovo-\nSolovovo was ignorant of the circumstances, or that he was actuated\nby a pardonable desire to close an incident obnoxious to the\nBuxhoewdt-n family.\" To bear out this supposition, Mr. Govett\nquotes ;i sentence from Owen : \" The matter had been hushed up\nat the time, through the influence of the family \" (Owen, Footfalls\non the Boundary of Another World, London, 1861, p. 191). If Mr.\nGovett had himself devoted a little more attention to the circumstances,\nhe would have discovered (1) that the \"matter\" which \"had been\nhushed up \" was not the disturbance among the Buxhoewden coffins,\nbut the suicide of a member of their family; (1) that Count Solovovo,\nfar from closing the incident, has contributed materially to its re\nopening, by causing a careful, though fruitless, search for the alleged\nofficial account to be made in 1899 in the official archives both at\nRiga and at Arensburg, and, later, by having enquiries made on the\nspot by a present member of the Buxhoewden family, the result of\nwhich enquiries were placed at our disposal.\nI am, SIR, Yours faithfully,\nALICE JOHNSON.\n\fNo. CCXLV.\u2014VOL.

SCHILLER ON A\nCRITICISM OF PROF. HYSLOP.\nPROF. HUGO MUNSTERBERG, of Harvard University, still believes in\nthe divine right of professors. He still believes that he has been\nprovidentially appointed as \" the psychologist,\" and ordained to\nenlighten the American people concerning every cause cdlebre which\nexcites the passing enthusiasm of the American reporter. And I\ndo not know that there would be much harm in this amiable\nbelief, if it were not associated in him with two other very\ncommon human traits, viz. strong prejudices and an intolerant\ntemper. These three characteristics unite to detract somewhat\nseriously from the value of the criticism he passes on Prof.\nHyslop's account of communications purporting to come from\nItichard Hodgson, which he has published in the Boston Sunday\nMagazine for Nov. 3, 1907.\nThe pith of Prof. Miinsterberg's criticism seems to be contained\nin the following paragraphs :\n\" Wherever mediums eke a living from the silly credulity of\nsuperstitious believers, it became for awhile the fashion to get\nmessages from Hodgson. Yet the fraud was so evident that serious\n\f164 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1908.\nminded occultists hardly gave any attention to these cheap tricks.\nBut soon the situation changed. It became known that Hodgson's\nfriend, Prof. Hyslop, the founder of the new American Society for\nPsychical Research, had attained to contact with the deceased, and\nagain through the agency of Mrs. Piper. Mr. Hyslop is a con\nscientious, scrupulous scholar, and, as to Mrs. Piper, it seems\nunreasonable to be suspicious of conscious fraud. The careful\nreports of these experiences have now been published. . . .\n\"... I admit Dr. Hyslop's best will for strict reserve ; yet there\nseems to be not the slightest occurrence between Dr. Hyslop and\nhis mediums which is not entirely explainable from the kind of\nabnormal brain action which every psychologist knows from observa\ntion of hysteria and hypnotism, of dreams and neurotic aberrations\u2014\nabnormal happenings which certainly do not need the spiritualistic\nmachinery. But while the psychologist rejects, in the one case as\nin the other, the explanation through spirits as superfluous and\nillogical, he ought to be willing to confess that behind the mere\nargument of reason stands more powerfully still the argument of\nemotion : his whole being abhors this repellent caricature of immor\ntality, this vulgar materialism which makes the after life a trivial\ncontinuation of the lowest stratum of our personality.1\n\" Of course this ethical and religious aspect of the great problem\nlies to-day outside of our discussion. If we were to consider it,\nwe should have to insist that the idea of eternal life is deprived\nof its highest meaning as soon as it is taken as such a temporal\nhabitation of man in remote quarters. But I wished to abstract\nhere from the speculations of the philosopher ; I wished to deal\nwith our question only as a psychologist. The problem is thus not\nwhether our dead friends are going on with their existence and\nare willing to talk ; it is only whether such automatic writings\ncan be accredited as supernatural messages from them.\n\" Of course, the public at large would hardly have been influenced\nso much by the slate writing of pathological mediums if there did\nnot exist a latent belief that all such unconscious utterances spring\nfrom a deeper subconscious personality. Such a subconscious self\nmay then be free from the limitations of our conscious self, may\nhave knowledge and insight which go beyond our conscious powers,\nmay thus perhaps enjoy a kind of long distance wireless connection\nwith other selves, and may afford, finally, even the longed for\ninformation from the dead. But it is the duty of the scientist to\n1 All this seems a very naive confession of prejudice.\u2014F. C. S. S.\n\fJAN., 1908. A Criticism of Professor Hyslop. 165\nemphasize that this belief, which is so fruitful for every supersti\ntion, has not the slightest basis in fact : there is no subconscious\npersonality whose powers are by principle different from or superior\nto the functions of our conscious self.1\n\"Indeed, there is no conscious life which does not depend upon\nunconscious factors. When we remember a face, a landscape, a\nname, a verse, which we saw or heard years ago, the impressions\nmust have remained in us unconsciously, and we may be only\ndoubtful whether we have to call them unconscious ideas or whether\nthe unconscious process was simply a brain state. In the same\nway most of our actions and thoughts are prepared and decided\noutside of consciousness. When we talk, we are not beforehand\nconscious of the movements of our lips and tongue, mostly not even\nconscious of the words ; the impulses to these speech movements in\nconversation result from our unconscious brain activities, and yet\nwe do not say that a subconscious personality selects our words :\nit is our true self which is working. Our only normal personality\nis thus made up in the largest part of its functions from unconscious\nideas and brain states, and all these unconscious processes are con\nstantly producing effects for which we alone are responsible, and\nnot a hidden, second person in us.2\n\" And there is nothing changed in principle if by a mental disease\u2014\nfor instance, hysteria\u2014the final effects of these unconscious doings\nremain themselves also unconscious to the actor. The speaking or\nwriting goes on then as normally as a result of the unconscious\nstates, and the difference is only that the writer does not know\nthat he, or rather she, is writing. That is abnormal and patho\nlogical ; but it gives not the least reason for believing that the\nwriting therefore results from a deeper layer of the person, that a\ndeeper spring of knowledge is touched, or that a hidden and\nmysterious personality comes to light. The unconscious scribbling\nof these automatic writers is entirely their own mental product,\nand the lack of conscious control can only decrease its value, and\ncannot possibly raise it to the height of an inspired revelation\nfrom supernatural spirits.\"\n*A delightfully dogmatic begging of the question. \u2014F. C. S. S.\n2 Prof. Munsterberg does not seem to realize that the relation of \"secondary\"\nand \"subconscious\" personalities to the \"normal\" self is a question not for\ndogmatism, but for inquiry. And how, one is curious to know, does he\nreconcile his metaphysical \" idealism \" with the physiological materialism of\nhis appeal to \"brain states\"?\u2014F. C. S. S.\n\f166 Journal of Society for Psychicdl Renearch. JAN., 1908.\nAs to the particular case that has roused Prof. Miinsterberg's\nire, Prof. Hyslop, as readers of Proceedings are probably aware, is\nextremely conscientious in publishing extraordinarily elaborate and\nuncompressed accounts of his experiments, such as would never\nbe expected, and hardly tolerated, in any recognized subject of\nscientific investigation. Now, in view of the novelty of Psychical\nEesearch, and the multiplicity of the sources of error with which\nit is beset, it is probably wiser to state explicitly and at length\nmany things which in ordinary scientific experimentation would be\ntaken for granted, as covered by the readers' general confidence\nin the competence of the experimenter. But it is evident that to\nstate everything in full must lead both to dulness and to a good\ndeal of triviality, on which a prejudiced critic may fasten if he\nchooses.\nIt may be said, however, that (on Prof. Miinsterberg's own showing)\nthe commonplaceness and triviality of his selections from Prof.\nHyslop's too voluminous reports in no wise exceeds that of his\ncriticisms. The attitude \"I won't believe in what you tell me of\nthe spirit world, because it is not nearly romantic enough\" is very\ntrite. So too is the attitude \"what the professor doesn't recognize,\nisn't true.\" So is the attitude \" ultimate reality must bear out my\nmetaphysic.\" But surely Prof. Miinsterberg could pacify the poet\nwithin his breast by reading Vergil or Dante, the professional by\nstudying a few of the strange cases of credulity and incredulity\nwhich diversify the annals of science, say the N-rays fiasco and\nthe Martian \"canals\" (which have at last had their scientific place\nin nature fixed by the photographic plate), and the speculative\ndogmatist by cultivating a sense of humour and realizing that the\ngrotesque spectacle presented by the history of philosophy, to wit\nthousands of metaphysicians each hazarding a cocksure affirmation\nabout ultimate reality which no other human being has ever been\nable to agree with, is to the full as \" silly \" as men's readiness to\ndeclare a difficult problem solved on insufficient grounds. He need\nnot on this account have fallen foul of Prof. Hyslop's praiseworthy\nand well-meant efforts. Curiously enough, the same paper contains\nan amusing illustration of the fallaciousness of Prof. Miinsterberg's\nmethod of criticism. In another article Mark Twain tells, in his\ninimitable way, how the secret of a lifetime was revealed by the\ninnocent-looking question, \"Tell me! What is the special peculiarity\nof smoked herrings 1 \"\nNevertheless I think it would be well if psychical researchers\n\fJAN., 1908. A Criticism of Professor Hyslop. 1 67\nwould try to meet Prof. Miinsterberg's strictures. Only he must\nco-operate, e.g. by sending in a brief sketch of the sort of after\nlife he would like to have and to have testified to by the \"spirits,\"\nin order that mediums might know where to look for the where\nwithal to please him. If it should then turn out either that\nnothing would satisfy his notions of his spiritual dignity, or nothing\nshort of the ipsissima verba of his own metaphysics, or nothing that\nseemed at all attractive and convincing to any one else, one would at\nleast be enabled to estimate Prof. Miinsterberg's criticism at its\ntrue value.\nCASE.\nP. 280. Impression.\nTHE following case is a somewhat unusual one, the initial\nexperiences of the percipient, Miss X. Y., being vague and\nunassociated with any particular person, though as they became\nintensified her thoughts lingered on a certain person whom she\nhad not seen for thirty years. At the time of her unpleasant\nsensations this person was in good health, but he died suddenly\n.a few days afterwards. She writes :\u2014\nNwember 5th, 1907.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014It has been suggested to me to send you an account\nof some strange mental experiences which came to me last spring\n\u2014between the middle of April, and the middle of May. These\nexperiences I can only describe as great waves of feeling, which\n\u2022carried me back to scenes long past, and among persons whom I\nhad almost forgotten, but which seemed for the time as real as the\nsurroundings of my present life. It happened to me three or four\ntimes at intervals of some days, each time taking me back to a\nmore distant past, and becoming increasingly vivid. At first I\nshook the feeling off, and worked harder than usual; but when\nthe same thing was repeated more and more forcibly I became\nalarmed lest I might be losing my reason. The alarm became\npositive distress with the last of these experiences. I am a teacher,\nand was occupied with some very dull children when it came upon\nme. In a moment I was overwhelmed with a flood of memories,\nwhich carried me so entirely into far different surroundings, that\nit was difficult to continue my work ; at the same time I became\nconvinced that there was a purpose^in what I was undergoing.\nAs soon as I could be alone and think it over a feeling of intense\n\f168 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 190&\nsuspense took possession of me, concerning some event intimately\nconnected with myself which was about to happen. In great\ndistress of mind I sought refuge in prayer that I might understand\nthese extraordinary experiences, and make no mistake about any\nthing I ought to do. I then set myself to think of all the persons\nwith whom I have been associated in the past, any of whom\nmight be needing me. The only one on whom my thoughts lingered\nwas a gentleman, between whom and myself there existed a romantic\nattachment in my very early youth, he being nine years my senior.\nOver 30 years ago we were parted,\u2014at the time through a foolish\nmisunderstanding, and later through circumstances. For many years\nI retained the hope of seeing him again; but as time went on I\ncould only conclude that he had forgotten me ; and among the\ncares and responsibilities of a very active life the remembrance of\nhim faded from my mind. However, within an hour or two of\nmy prayer for guidance I had decided to see him at the earliest\npossible moment, though it meant a journey of over two hundred\nmiles ; and had I been free I should have started at once : as it\nwas, I had to content myself with the determination to go at the\nend of the term.\nNeither of the scenes to which I had, (so to speak), been trans\nported had any connection with him, but the impression became\ntoo vivid to be questioned.\nThis happened, I believe, but am not perfectly certain, on May\n17, at which time the gentleman was in good health, as I have\nascertained since, and his health continued, so far as could be\nseen, up to the moment of his death, on the 20th\u2014three day&\nlater; it could not have been more sudden or unexpected. I have\nhad no return of my strange experiences, and nothing can shake\nmy conviction that in some mysterious way they foreshadowed his\ndeath.\nX. Y.\nIn a later letter Miss X. Y. wrote :\nNovember 14.\n... I have pinned the cuttings in their right order. In.\nthe first it is said that the death took place on the Tuesday, May\n21st, but unless Mr. was in the habit of sitting up till past\nmidnight, that could not have been. Had he been living till 12\np.m., he would probably have gone to bed, where he would have been\nfound. I mention this because I give the 20th as the day of his\ndeath. But in any case it only makes the difference of a few hours.\n\fJAN., 1908. Case. 16J\u00bb\nFrom Mr. J.'s letter, as well as from P.'s statement, I incline to\nthink that he had passed away before 11. You will see from his\nbrother's evidence that he was visiting at [his brother's house]\nwhen the strange feelings came over me. ... X. Y.\nThe newspaper cuttings referred to, which were sent to us,\ncontained the account of the coroner's inquest, and of the\nfuneral, as well as a later one describing the unveiling of a\ntablet in memory of the deceased gentleman. They all gave\nMay 21st, 1907, as the date of the death.\nAt the inquest his brother stated that the deceased gentle\nman had stayed with him during some part of previous week,\nand when he left on the previous Saturday was apparently in\ngood health.\nHis servant stated that when he retired to bed on\nMonday night at 11 o'clock, he left his master, as he\nthought reading in his study. He went into the study at\nabout a quarter past 7 on the next morning, and found him\nsitting on a chair in front of the< fireplace with a book\nopen before him. Thinking he was asleep, he spoke to\nhim but received no reply. He then found that he was dead.\nA letter from a neighbouring Vicar says : \" he had no-\nwarning signs before his death ; everything just as usual. He\nworked in his garden till 9 p.m., went to his study, read and\nthen went quietly into the presence of God.\"\nMES. EDDY.\nBY J. ARTHUR HILL.\nTo the psychical researcher, as such, the beliefs and practices\nof the \" Christian Scientists \" are of no great interest. The\nspeculative beliefs can hardly be regarded as scientific theories,\nat least by those whose conceptions of science are of a\ncomparatively humble and grovelling order ; in fact, some\nimpatient souls, anxious to keep as close to sensory experience\nas possible, may be inclined to dismiss those beliefs as a\nkind of insane metaphysics, a degenerate and confused\nBerkeleyanism. The practices, however, are in rather different\ncase. It is alleged that, by these\" practices\u2014which consist\nchiefly in bringing about a change in the patient's beliefs\u2014\n\f170 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1908.\nbodily diseases are cured ; and here we reach a point which\nfalls within the sphere of science as we understand the\nword. It is a matter which can be decided by observation\n.and induction. And, as the means employed are of psychical\nrather than physical nature, these practices are of some\ninterest to our research. It will be remembered, however,\nthat Mr. F. W. H. Myers and Dr. A. T. Myers examined\nthe evidence for some of these alleged cures (Proceedings,\nVol. IX., p. 160), and that their conclusions were not\nfavourable. No satisfactory evidence for a cure of well-\nauthenticated organic disease by \" Christian Science \" methods\nwas found ; and, in cases of apparently functional disorders\nwhich were cured, it did not seem necessary to suppose that\nanything except suggestion was the cause of the cure. And,\nthough \" suggestion \" is not completely satisfactory as an\n-explanation (since we do not know why or how the suggestion\noperates), it is sufficient for our purpose if these cures can\nbe even thus partially and inadequately explained ; for it will\nat least appear that the peculiarities of \" Christian Science \"\nare not essential parts of the programme. Dr. Tuckey and\nDr. Bramwell do not trouble their patients with exhortations\nand arguments concerning \" mortal mind,\" nor do they assure\nthem that they are mistaken in believing themselves to be\nill ; yet their results are more remarkable than any well-\nauthenticated series of Christian Science cures so far produced.\nAnd it is to- be noted that deep hypnosis is not always\nnecessary. Suggestions frequently \" take,\" even though no\nmore than a slight drowsiness is obtained ; and the results of\nDr. Barrows and others seem to indicate that a profoundly\noperative therapeutical suggestion may sometimes be planted\neven in a mind which is awake and apparently normal.\nChristian Science cures, then\u2014assuming them to occur\u2014are\nprobably due to suggestion.\nThe present paper, however, is more particularly concerned\nwith the founder of the cult than with the cult itself. The\nlife and character of Mrs. Eddy present many features which\nare of some psychological interest, and it seems worth while\nto consider briefly the chief events in her history, from a\npsychical research point of view. For the facts and dates in\n.the following account, we are indebted to the excellent articles\n\f\u2022JAN., 1908. Mrs. Eddy. 171\non Mrs. Eddy by Miss Georgine Milmine, which appeared in\nM'Clurc's Magazine, Jan. to May, 1907.\nMary A. Morse Baker was born on July 16, 1821, at\nBow, on the Merrimac River, New Hampshire. She was the\nyoungest child of Mark Baker and Abigail Barnard (Ambrose)\nBaker. Her ancestors on both sides\u2014the Bakers and the\nAmbroses\u2014were sober, industrious farmers, with a strong New\nEngland turn for religion. Mark Baker, her father, was a\nman of strong personality, but of little education. He was\na keen hand at a bargain, but was upright in his dealings,\nand was apparently a typical Puritan. His chief preoccupations\nwere politics and religion, and he was intolerant, dogmatic,\ndomineering, and passionate in the expression of his opinion\nin both. His children inherited many of his qualities, and\n\" all the Bakers had a reputation for crankiness \" ; but there\nwas marked capacity in many of them. Mark Baker's eldest\ndaughter, Abigail, married an Alexander Hamilton Tilton, who\nmade a fortune as a woollen manufacturer ; and after his\ndeath his widow took control of his large manufacturing\ninterests, managing them with great success. Albert\u2014the\nsecond son\u2014was similarly capable. He, alone among the\nBakers, received a good education ; he studied law with\nFranklin Pierce, afterwards President of the United States ;\nwent into politics, served in the State legislature, and was\nnominated for Congress ; but died prematurely at the age of\nthirty-one. Of Mark Baker's six children\u2014three sons and three\ndaughters\u2014only Mrs. Eddy survives. All, except Albert, died\n\u2022of cancer, and nearly all their children have succumbed to\nthe same disease.\nThe first fifteen years of Mary Baker's life were passed at\nthe old farm at Bow. It was a lonely place, and \" the church\nsupplied the only social diversions.\" The children worked on\nthe farm ; education was probably neglected ; the father's\nlibrary consisted of one book\u2014the Bible ; the regime was\nsimple, stern, primitive. But though hard work and long hours\nseems to have been the rule for the others, Mary herself\nwas exempted. The reason was twofold : her beauty helped\nher to get her own way, and her ill-health made physical\nlabour mostly impossible. This latter point is interesting ; for\nher symptoms seem to have been of nervous character, and\n\f172 Journal of Society for Psychical Rexearch. JAN.,\nher environment during these important formative years may\nhave had a great effect in determining her later evolution.\nShe was subject to violent seizures of epileptiform nature, in\nwhich she would fall to the ground, sometimes kicking and\nscreaming, sometimes limp, sometimes cataleptic. The neigh\nbours called them \" tantrums,\" and looked on her as a spoilt\nchild. The family physician, Dr. Ladd, diagnosed her attacks\nas \" hysteria mingled with bad temper.\" He tried \" mes\nmerism,\" with partly satisfactory results ; and perhaps some\ntelepathic rapport was established between them, for it is\nreported that he could make her \" stop in the street, merely\nby thinking.\" Of this, however, no good evidence is now\navailable. In her autobiography\u2014Retrospection and Introspection\n\u2014she describes how she heard voices calling her by name.\nThis appears to have been when she was about eight years of\nage. The voices\u2014unlike Joan of Arc's\u2014do not seem to have\ngiven her any messages, and were apparently degenerative rather\nthan \" evolutive \" in character. That is, if they occurred at\nall\u2014for Mrs. Eddy's recollections are in some instances\ndemonstrably mistaken, and in others extremely doubtful. She\ninforms us that her brother Albert taught her Hebrew,\nGreek, and Latin, and that, as a child, her favourite studies\nwere Natural Philosophy, Logic, and Moral Science! According\nto some of her old schoolmates, this is as \" grossly exagger\nated \" as the account of Mark Twain's death, which the\nhumourist himself was able to contradict. These acquaintances\nof her childhood inform us that Mary was backward and\nindolent, and that \" Smith's Grammar, and as far as long\ndivision in arithmetic,\" may be taken as indicating the extent\nof her scholastic acquirements. It appears that Mrs. Eddy\nmakes no claim to scholarship now ; in fact, she dropped all\nthat useless and indeed false knowledge when she made the\nmore than compensating discovery of real wisdom, which is,\nbeing interpreted, Christian Science.\nIn 1836, when Mary was fifteen, her father sold the Bow\nfarm, and the family moved to Sanbornton Bridge\u2014now\nTilton. Here there was more social life, for The Bridge was\na lively manufacturing place. She went to school here, but\nher hysterical attacks caused her attendance to be inter\nmittent ; and her old neighbours and schoolfellows say that\n\fJAN., 1908. Mrs. Eddy. 173\nshe received little education. She seems to have had a\nwandering sort of mind, incapable of concentration.\nThe intellectual atmosphere of the New England towns at\nthis time is of some importance as an aid to understanding\nMrs. Eddy. There was a wave of \" occultism \" passing over\nthe land. \" Animal magnetism,\" mesmerism, clairvoyance, etc.,\nwere in the air, and lecturers on these matters appeared in\nevery village. In 1837 Charles Poyen published a book\nentitled Animal Magnetism in New England, and he seems to\nhave lectured in many of the districts where Mrs. Eddy\npassed her earlier years. There had also risen above the\nhorizon that curious medium-philosopher Andrew Jackson\nDavis, whose influence afterwards became so great among the\nspiritualists ; and many strange religious sects sprang up,\nprominent among them the \" Shakers,\" who regarded Ann Lee\nas the \" female Christ,\" the \" woman of the Apocalypse,\" the\n\" Holy Comforter.\" The Shakers called their establishment the\n\"Church of Christ\"; Mrs. Eddy's sect is \"The Church of\n\u2022Christ, Scientist.\" It seems probable that the earlier sect\ninfluenced the founder of the later, directly or indirectly.\nThere was a flourishing colony of Shakers at Canterbury, five\nmiles from Tilton.\nIn 1843 Mary Baker married her first husband, George\n\"Washington Glover. He was a friend of her brother Samuel\n\u2014who had married Glover's sister\u2014and the two had learnt\nthe bricklayer's trade together. Mr. and Mrs. Glover went to\nWilmington, South Carolina; but in June, 1844, Glover died\n\u2022of yellow fever. His wife was left without money, but\ncharitable help enabled her to return home to her father's\nhouse at Tilton. Here, in September, 1844, her only child\nwas born, and she named him after his father, George\nWashington Glover.\nA period of ten years of widowhood now began. Having\nno means, she made an attempt to support herself by teach\ning ; but the experiment lasted only a few weeks. Her\nbrothers and sisters had married and left home, her mother\nwas old and incapacitated, and her father was past his prime.\nIn spite of her ill-health and troubles, she seems to have\n\u2022dominated her surroundings to an astonishing extent. Dividing\nher time between her father's house and the home of her\n\f174 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1908.\nsister, Mrs. Tilton, she reigned in both as an honoured\nguest, though dependent on her father and sister for food,,\nclothing, and such money as she got. Her hysterical attacks\nbecame worse, and she passed long periods in a state of'\napparent collapse. Noise was unbearable, and straw was laid\nin i'ront of the house. She also showed eccentricities, such\nas a mania for being swung or rocked\u2014her father had a\nlarge cradle made specially\u2014and for lonely wanderings at\nnight. During this period she went into trances, in which\nshe had what purported to be visions of distant scenes and\nevents ; in one instance she described the whereabouts of\nsome hidden treasure, but several days' digging in the place\nindicated failed to reveal the promised hoard. She was\ninterested in spiritualism, and heard \" rappings \" at night, like\nthe Fox sisters. In character she was affected and artificial,\nfond of long words\u2014which she frequently misused\u2014yet\nengaging enough when she tried to charm. Like Madame\nBlavatsky, Mrs. Eddy seems to have been able to obtain a\nrather remarkable influence over many of those with whom\nshe came in contact; though far inferior to Madame in\naccomplishments and learning, her physical attractiveness was\nmuch greater, thus supplying compensation.\nIn 1853 Mrs. Glover married Daniel Patterson, a travelling\ndentist. Her state of health was such that, on the wedding-\nday, Patterson had to carry his bride downstairs and back\nagain. During the next eight years they lived at various\nplaces, always very poor, and Mrs. Patterson apparently still\nailing, nervous, and bad tempered. In 1866 Patterson seems\nto have had enough of his wife's ways, and she on her part\nseemed to have no particular affection for him. He left her,\nbut made some provision for her support. In 1873 she\nobtained a divorce on the ground of desertion. This much\nmay be said at once, in order that the thread of the narrative\nmay not need to be broken by any further mention of\nPatterson. But during this period an event which is important\nin Mrs. Eddy's history had happened. This was her meeting\nwith the famous Phineas Parkhurst Quimby, who plays the\nmost notable secondary part in the drama of her life.\nThis remarkable man was the son of a blacksmith, and\nwas born in 1802. He had scarcely any education, but\n\fJAN., 1908. Mrs. Eddy. 175-\npossessed an intelligent and inquiring mind. Hearing Poyen\nlecture, he became greatly interested in \" mesmerism,\" and\neventually he gave up his trade of clock-making and became\na professional \" mesmerist.\" With his subject, Lucius Burkmar\n\u2014a lad of about seventeen\u2014he travelled all over New\nEngland, performing the usual feats. His results convinced\nhim that Burkmar, in trance, could accurately diagnose\ndiseases, and could prescribe treatment which frequently proved\neffective. Accordingly, for three or four years the two\npractised in this way But during his investigations Quiinby\ncame to the conclusion that his clairvoyant did not really see\nthe interior of the patient's body, but that he had a power\nof mind-reading which enabled him to reflect the beliefs of\nthe patient or of some other person in the room. Further,\nQuimby arrived at the opinion that it was not the drugs\nthat cured, but the faith of the patient. Consequently, he\ndropped mesmerism, discharged Burkmar, and began to work\nout a theory of \"mind-cure.\" In 1859 he opened an office\nin Portland ; patients came from far and near, and he treated\nall who came, whether they could pay or not. Quimby was\nvery far above the level of the average quack. He was in\nall the relations of life an admirable man ; and, though a\nman of one idea, that idea was creditable. His one aim was\nto make his patients well. He embodied his theory in\nvoluminous MSS., in which he speaks of it as \" The Science\nof Christ,\" and once or twice as \" Christian Science.\" But he\ndid not identify it with religion, or attempt to found an\necclesiastical organisation.\nIn 1861 the Pattersons were living at Eumney, New\nHampshire. Mrs. Patterson, then forty years old, was a\nconfirmed invalid, and had been practically bedridden since\nher second marriage. Having heard of Quimby's wonderful\ncures, Dr. Patterson wrote to him at Portland ; but the\nformer had no intention of visiting the Eumney district, and\nthe latter could not afford the journey to Portland with his\ninvalid wife. Eventually, however, Mrs. Patterson raised\nsufficient money, and in Oct., 1862, she reached Portland, on\na visit which was to mark a crisis in her life. She stayed\napparently about three weeks, and under Quimby's treatment\nher maladies disappeared. Her faith had made her whole.\n\f176 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1908.\nAs it afterwards appeared, however, there was no complete or\npermanent restoration, for she was still subject to nervous\nseizures.\nBut the effect on her physical health was of secondary\nimportance ; it was the mental outcome of her visit that was\nso striking. She became interested in Quimby's system,\nwatched his treatment of patients, read his manuscripts,\nlistened eagerly to his expositions. Probably her own mind\nmay have been running in similar grooves, but\u2014in spite of\nher denial l\u2014it seems indubitable that she learnt from Quimby\nalmost all that she afterwards taught. She wrote letters to\nthe Portland papers, lauding him and his system in the most\nextravagant language. The man and the subject possessed\nher. She talked of him incessantly, and wrote letters to him\nin the most reverential terms. Incidentally, these letters\nshow that she was still in poor health, for she sometimes\nasks for \"absent treatment.\"\nEarly in 1864 she paid Quimby another visit, staying in\nPortland two or three months. She continued her studies\nwith greater zeal than ever ; and during this visit she seems\nto have formed a desire to assist in the teaching of Quimby's\nsystem. She saw possibilities of a career in front of her, and\nambition spurred her on. It need not of course be denied\nthat higher motives were also present ; Quimby wrought cures,\nand his new disciple would no doubt share his enthusiasm\nand his genuine passion for relieving the sufferings of his\nfellow-men. But, on the whole, it would appear that .the\nmaster was the finer character of the two.\n1 \"No human pen nor tongue taught me the Science contained in this book,\nScience and Health; and neither tongue nor pen can overthrow it.\"\u2014Science\nand Health, p. 110, 1907 ed.\n\\To be continued.,]\n\fNo. CCXLVL\u2014VOL.

FEB., 1908.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nTHE 131st General Meeting of the Society was held in the\nlarge Hall at 20 Hanover Square, London, W., on Thursday,\nJanuary 30th, 1908, at 4.30 p.m. Mrs. Sidgwick, having\nbeen introduced as the new President by Sir William Crookes,\ntook the chair and called on Sir Oliver Lodge . to read his\npaper on \" Automatism and Possession \" ; of which only an\nabstract here follows.\nSIR OLIVER LODGE began by saying: The word \"possession\"\nis generally used with an evil or at least a pathological\nconnotation : not always, however, .for we have the idea of\nself-possession, and that of a genius, possessed of ideas. This\nis more akin to my present theme, for I intend to use it\nin a quite sane and definite sense, as equivalent to motor\nautomatism or telergy ; so as to cleanse the word into\nsomething like orthodoxy without referring to its pathological\nsense. I possess this body and brain ; if any other intel\nligence could control them or part of them for a time, he\nwould possess them. Consider what occurs during speaking\nand writing. An idea is conceived . in the mind ; but in\norder to make itself known or to act as a stimulus, it must\nmove matter. The re-arrangement of matter is all that we\nare able to accomplish in the physical world. The only .way\nwe can touch the material world is through our muscles.\nBut a thought belongs to a different order. How can it get\nitself translated into terms of motion ? Physiology partially\ninforms us of the method, and the brain is the organ of\ntranslation. But what stimulates the brain ? In many cases\nreflex action ; though since that involves no consciousness, it\nis of small psychical interest. By what means the psychical\ngets out of its region into the physical no one knows, but\nit is a process on which discovery is possible. The brain\nis definitely the link between the two universes or modes of\nexistence. It may not be the only link, but it is the only\nlink we know of.\nI now illustrate the subject by constructing certain diagrams.\nNo. I. is the diagram of a \" self \" or personality. The\nhorizontal line separates the psychical world from the physical\nworld, and the self is assumed to have half in each, abutting\n\fFEB., 1908. 181\nGeneral Meeting.\nagainst one another, after the manner of a placenta. In the\npsychical part we have the unconscious life, common to animals\nand even plants ; and in the higher animals we have the\nbeginnings of consciousness.\nIn the physical part we have the brain leading by efferent\nnerve to muscle, and so out into the external world by\nDiagram of a Self.\nExternal Spiritual World\nConsciousness\nLtmtlntt\ni\u00bb\nmotion\nExternal Maiet-ial World\nmotion ; and we have impulses from that world, received by a\nsense organ, transmitted through sensory or afferent nerve to\nthe brain, and so up across, the boundary line into the\npsychical half as \" perception.\"\nAnother arrow across the bounding line comes down as\n\" will \" from consciousness to brain.\nFrom the unconscious life we have nutrition and other\nvital processes on the one side, and the storage of habits\n\f182 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1908.\nand unconscious memory on the other ; instinct also, giving\nmotor impulses to the brain, and dreams of one kind received\nthence. Further, we have some connexion between unconscious\nPersonalities.\nt\n.Normal\nDominating Mediumistic\nMultiple\n?\u2014-\nEnfeebled\nlife and consciousness, in genius ; represented so because it stimu\nlates to action through will. On the other side is memory,\nwhereby innumerable impressions are stored unconsciously.\nThere is also represented a couple of links between the\npsychical part and the external spiritual world, which are\nlabelled inspiration and aspiration respectively.\n\fFEB., 1908. General Meeting. 183\nOn the left-hand side of the diagram the arrows are drawn\ndownwards, as tending towards activity ; and on the right-\nhand side upwards, as representing the receptive faculties. The\ntwo sides, however, are merely a diagrammatic convenience.\nVitality unites the two halves and pierces the boundary ;\nwhile trance partially, and death completely, separates, but\ndoes not destroy.\nDiagram No. II. represents different kinds of \" personality,\"\nsome of them pathological. They speak fairly for themselves ;\nthe intention being that impressions are received or transmitted\nacross the bounding line ; so that when the personality is\ndislocated, impressions may be received from other than the\nordinary psychical unit, and may also be transmitted down\nwards to influence other physical units.\nThe \" enfeebled \" personality may be taken to represent\nsecond-childishness; possibly also some cases of lunacy, of\nwhich, however, there are many varieties.\nNo. III. aims at being a complete scheme of human faculty;\ntwo selves or individuals being represented, one in the condition\nfor activity, the other in the condition for receptivity. The\nwhole of the internal contents are here simplified for diagram\nmatic purposes, since the aim of the diagram is to show different\nmodes of connexion or interaction. It is not maintained that\nall the arrows have a real existence, but the existence of all\nhas been asserted from time to time, and accordingly they are\nprovided for in the scheme.\nDirect connexion between mind and mind is labelled tele\npathy. Sympathetic or antipathetic links between body and\nbody, for instance as by \" brain waves,\" is labelled sympathy.\nThe action of one mind on another brain is labelled telergy ;\nand the action of the motions or \" passes \" of one body on\nthe consciousness or subconsciousness of another person is\nlabelled hypnotism.\nThe normal mode of communication between two individuals\nis shown through the medium of an external physical world\nlabelled \"3?, through muscular movements and sensory impressions.\nThus the mind \u2022^l normally operates on the mind >|^2 by the\nroundabout path through his own brain and muscle, then through\nthe vibrations of the common air, to the sense organ of the\nother person, and so up through his brain to his mind. The\n\f184 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1908.\nspiritualists generally hold that what we call ' telepathy ' is not\nreally a direct link between \\|^1 and -v\/\/-2> as represented in the\ndiagram, but takes place through the general psychical world\n\u00a5 ; in analogy with the above normal mode of communication\nthrough the general physical world <!?.\nScheme of Human Faculty.\nAn extension of muscular power beyond the bodily peri\nphery is labelled \" ectoplasy,\" and represents what has been\nasserted of table-turning and the like.

FEB., 1908.\nTHE PRESIDENT, MRS. SIDGWICK, said that she was sure she\nshould be expressing the feeling of those present in thanking\nSir Oliver Lodge most heartily for his interesting address.\nIn regard to the evidence which in his view pointed towards\n\" possession \" in the case of Mrs. Piper, to which he had\nreferred in the latter part of his speech, she wished to say\nthat the Council greatly regretted that it was not at present\npossible for members to discuss it with advantage, since the\ndetailed Report was not yet in their hands. Delay had\nunfortunately been caused through Mr. Piddington's illness,\nand consequently it would be some months before the evidence\nobtained through Mrs. Piper and described in the papers read\nby him at the last two meetings of the Society could be\npublished. The President added that those who knew her\nwould not be surprised that she should not be quite so\nsanguine as Sir Oliver Lodge in her estimate of the results\nof the investigations made in recent years, but that she did\nthink we had obtained evidence of a kind different from\nwhat had been obtained before, and that when it had all\nbeen thoroughly studied, it would be found that a distinct\nadvance had been made.\nREPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR THE YEAR 1907.\nTHE Membership of the Society has remained practically\nstationary during the year, although, owing to the transference\nof Members and Associates of the American Branch to the\nParent Society, there would appear to be a gain of 199.\nSeventeen new Members were elected during the year ;\ntwenty-three Members were transferred from the American\nBranch ; while six Associates became Members ; making a\ngain of 46 Members, against which must be set off twelve\nresignations, two deaths, four transferred to Associateships, and\nfour removed from the list on account of non-payment of\nsubscriptions. This makes a total loss of 22 Members during\n1907, leaving a net increase of 24 (or one, exclusive of the\nAmerican Members) and a total of 254 Ordinary Members.\nThere are also 28 Honorary and Corresponding Members, or\n282 Members in all.\n\fFEB., 1908. Report of the Council. 187\nEighty-one new Associates were elected during the year,\nfour Members became Associates, and 168 Associates were\nadded from the American Branch ; against this must be set\noff 50 resignations, 5 deaths, 6 changes to Membership, and\n17 removals from the list. Consequently the total loss of\nAssociates for the year was 78, leaving a net increase of\n175 (or 9, without the American Associates) and a total\nof 840 Ordinary Associates. There are also 16 Honorary\nAssociates, or 856 Associates in all. The grand total of\nMembers and Associates at the end of 1907 therefore stands\nat 1138.\nThe chief work done by the Society during the year has\nbeen in connection with Mrs. Piper's visit to England. In\nresponse to the invitation of the Council, Mrs. Piper came\nover from America and remained here for six months\u2014from\nNovember, 1906, to May, 1907, during which period 74 sittings\n(of an average duration of about two hours and a half) were\nheld under the supervision of a Committee appointed by the\nCouncil for the purpose, consisting of the President, Mrs.\nSidgwick, Sir Oliver Lodge, Mr. J. G. Piddington, and Mr.\nFrank Podmore. Two papers giving some of the results of\nthe investigation were read at Private Meetings of the Society\nby Mr. Piddington, and every confidence is felt that the ex\npenditure of time, energy, and money on these experiments\nwith Mrs. Piper has yielded material which will be of real\nand permanent value to psychical research.\nIn order to bring out the results obtained, it was found\nthat a far more exhaustive examination both of these and of\nprevious records than has been the case with the earlier\nAmerican sittings was necessary. So much additional work\nwas thereby thrown on the staff that the Council determined\nto carry out without further delay the plan for which the\nEndowment Fund was instituted, and to appoint an additional\nofficer. This was done by making Miss Alice Johnson\nResearch Officer, Mr. Bickford-Smith being appointed Secre\ntary and Editor in Miss Johnson's place.\nSince Miss Johnson assumed her new office in October, she\nhas been engaged in writing a report on the automatic script\nof Mrs. Holland, on which she read a preliminary paper at\na Meeting of the Society in July. The report is now being\n\f188 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

An interesting\ncase of the latter kind, recounted by a lady who had long\npractised the system, was printed in the Journal for December,\n1904 (Vol. XL, pp. 318-20). In the following case, Mrs.\nWilliamson, the writer of the account, seems to have got rid\nof the effects left by an acute bronchial attack through similar\nmeans. She writes :\nTHE CROFT,\nDIDSBURY, MANCHESTER, 29th November, 1907.\nI have been hoping that some of your members would have\ntaken up a side of Psychical Eesearch which appears to me to\noffer great possibilities. That is, the power of the mind over the\nbody under normal conditions.\nLet us take the case of a chronic bronchial affection and\nconsider it in this light. Owing perhaps to an attack of bronchitis,\nthe organs affected have set up a habit of sensitiveness to changes\nof temperature, draughts, etc. ; these are the stimuli, and uncon\nsciously the organs respond immediately with a cough, each time\nmaking the habit deeper, until such distractions as \"change of\nair\" are powerless to eradicate the physical habit.\n[But such a habit may be] checked and gradually eradicated, as\nthe will can check and eradicate a bad moral habit, or conversely,\nestablish any number of habits, in such things as the muscles, as\nfor instance in the movements of the fingers in piano playing. . . .\nI enclose an account of the curing of the bronchial tendency in\nmy own case which took place last week, the statement being\nsigned and corroborated by my friend Miss Cathinca Hartwig.\n\f192 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1908.\nI had an acute bronchial attack in the summer of last year, which\nleft my bronchial tubes and throat extremely sensitive, so that almost\never since I have been liable to fits of coughing whenever I was near\nto an open window, or there was any sudden change of temperature.\nThis became so bad lately that my husband strongly advised me to\nsee a specialist about it.\nThis I consented to do, on Saturday, 16th November, but the next\nday it occurred to me to try the effect of will power instead, and defer\nconsulting the specialist for at any rate another week.\nEach time I began to cough, I checked myself firmly (as one might\na child), and to my unbounded astonishment, the habit became\nbroken so quickly that by Friday the 22nd the tendency to\ncough had completely gone and I could face open windows and\ndoors and even sit in draughts with impunity. Such a remarkable\nresult was beyond anything that I had anticipated.\nEMILY WILLIAMSON.\nMiss Hartwig writes :\nMrs. Williamson told me of her intention of consulting a specialist\nabout her throat on Saturday, the 16th November, and the next\nday, that she intended to try the \"will power\" instead. On Friday,\nthe 22nd, the cough seemed to have gone altogether.\nCATHINCA HARTWIG.\nTHE MEDICAL SOCIETY FOE THE STUDY OF\nSUGGESTIVE THEEAPEUTICS.\nTHE Quarterly Meeting was held at the rooms of the Society\nfor Psychical Eesearch on January 16th.

Poltergeist\nTHE following account has been sent by a Member of the Society,\nwho believes implicitly in the lona fides of the witnesses. The\nnarrator is the owner of the house. The Editor of the Journal\nhas seen the original correspondence and the photographs which\ncorroborate the narrative. The occupants of the house are very\nanxious that their names should not be given in full, the owner\nbeing in a professional position which he thinks might be detri\nmentally effected if his name were known in connection with\nsuch an affair. The narrator is a person of education, and made\nnotes at the time.\nBefore I begin my narration, I think it right to state that my\nfather, who had lived with us ever since my mother's death in the\nyear 1875, died in March, 1907, at the age of 90 years. He was\na man of strong will, firm in his religious opinions, and took a\ndeep interest in everything that concerned our welfare.\nOur cottage is completely detached, and my wife and I sleep\ndownstairs. There are two bedrooms upstairs, the one on the right\nof the landing, which, for clearness, I shall call room (No. 1), is\nwhere my two sons J. and F. [both over twenty years old] slept.\nIt had been my father's room, and it was there he died. The room\non the left (No. 2) was occupied by my married daughter H. and\nM. the wife of my second son, who is at present in Africa.\nFrom 13th Aug., 1907, mysterious knockings were always heard\nabout midnight in room (No. 2), causing great alarm to the occupants ;\nbut after some time these knockings stopped in (No. 2) room, and\nstarted in (No. 1). On 30th Aug., a small press used to hold\nbottles, etc., for photographic purposes, which stood against the wall,\nwas forced out about 9 inches from the wall, and a mahogany box,\nalso containing photographic apparatus, which stood on top of this\npress, was thrown violently down. The crash was so great that my\nwife and I were awakened by it, and immediately went upstairs and\nsaw the press and box as described, and we also heard knocking as\nwe were going upstairs. This caused so much alarm that it was\ndecided to keep the gas burning in the bedroom every night.\nOn 3rd Sept. my daughter H., who had been on a visit to us,\nleft for France to join her husband there. After this, M., my\ndaughter-in-law, occasionally felt her bed shaken, and my son J.\n\fMABCH, 1908. Oases. 195\nsometimes felt as if a hand were trying to draw away his pillow\nfrom under his head. The knockings still continued, and distant\nsounds as of some one coming upstairs, turning the handle of door,\nand walking about the room were heard by my sons.\nOn the morning of 8th Dec. about 2.20, M. saw a hand on her\npillow, a long hand with kuotty joints. J., some nights previous\nto this, thought he saw a hand come out of the wall ; but as he\nconsidered he might have been mistaken he did not speak of it till\nM. spoke of the hand she had seen on her pillow.\nOn Dec. 16th rappings were heard about midnight, and a small\nwash-hand stand, with a folding writing desk on the top of it, was\nmoved out from wall 6 or 8 inches. J., who was lying awake at\nthe time, saw this movement and called his mother and me to come\nup, which we did, and saw these articles had been shifted as stated.\nOn llth Dec., about 10.15 a.m., after M. had cleaned out room\n(No. 1 ), she went downstairs for a scuttle of coal ; on her return to\nthe room she found it all in disorder, two basket chairs had been\noverturned, ashpan and front of grate removed and laid on the\ncarpet, and clothing belonging to my sons, which had been hanging\non pegs, a towel from wash-hand stand, a -box from top of chest of\ndrawers, etc., were all on floor; four pictures had also been taken\nfrom off the wall and laid, glass downwards, on the bed ; all this\nhad been done without the slightest noise, and nothing was damaged.\nNobody but my wife and daughter-in-law were in the house at the\ntime, and they were so terrified at all this that they rushed out\ninto the back garden and remained there for about an hour in the\nrain, till a message girl came to the door, and they got a telegram\nsent to me to come home, which I did, arriving about one o'clock.\nAfter this the rooms upstairs were vacated, and all slept downstairs.\nDecember 18th, about 10.15 a.m., nearly all the furniture in room\n(No. 1) was again overturned, and most of the remaining pictures\nwere taken down and placed on the bed, face downwards as before,\nthe looking-glass had also been taken off the table at the window\nand laid on the floor along with other things, and a bracket con\ntaining a number of small volumes of Shakespeare's works was\ntaken off the chest of drawers and added to the heap. This was\nphotographed by my eldest son about 11 o'clock same night, and is\nshown in photo (A herewith).\nDecember 21st. Whilst my wife and I were in town to-night,\nleaving J. and M. and a visitor in the house, three loud smashes\nwere heard in the lobby, accompanied by knocking.\n\f196 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MARCH, 1908.\nDecember 24th. At the time my wife and I were at church\nto-day, my two sons and M. being at home, same things occurred\nabout 12.25.\nDecember 31st. My wife and M. heard the same this forenoon.\nJanuary 1st, 1908. Three loud blows were heard on lobby wall\nabout 5.40 p.m. by all in the house, including some visitors.\nI may mention here it is the habit of old-fashioned people in\nScotland to remain out of bed to bring in the New Year, and very\noften friends visit and bring it in along with them.\nJanuary 2nd. Three blows on wall of lobby were heard by F.\nand M., and also by a visitor.\nJanuary 13th. Between 10 and 11 this morning the chest of\ndrawers in bedroom (No. 1) was found to be out from wall at one\nend about eighteen inches or so, and again the bracket of small\nvolumes, a dressing case and small camera were all on the floor.\nMy wife and M. were so much frightened that they shut the\nhouse and went to town. On their return, about 4.30, they found\nthat the arm-chair in the kitchen, which was standing in a corner\nwhen they left, had been placed close to the fire, where my father\nused to sit when he came in from the garden on a cold day.\nJanuary 15th. This forenoon the chest of drawers was again\nmoved, the other end being drawn back from the wall ; the bed\nwas also out of its place, and the arm-chair in same room (No. 1)\nwas moved from the fireside corner to the window, a distance of\nabout four yards, and placed in the position where my father used\nto sit and watch for us coming home from business at night.\nJanuary 18th. Arm-chair in room (No. 1) was again shifted from\nfireside to window.\nJanuary 20th. Bed in room (No. 1) was moved during the day.\nMy wife replaced it with head to the wall as usual, but it was\nagain moved from its position.\nJanuary 21st. About 10 o'clock this morning the mattress of bed\nin room (No. 1) was found to have been tilted up against rail at\nfoot of bed ; about 1 1 a.m. M. had occasion to stoop down to get\na box from under a bed downstairs, when the mattress and\nbedding were all pulled over her, and she was held down on the\nfloor, unable to free herself. Her cries brought my wife to her\nassistance, and she was released in a fainting condition. About an\nhour after this the bed clothes in room (No. 1) were dragged off\nthe bed and laid on the floor, and a large chest, containing\nbedding, etc., opened and some of the contents emptied out.

A colleague of mine,\nMr. F. H. Peachell, who lives in the same house with me, has an\n\"eight-day\" clock (the clock's period has not been exactly deter\nmined), which he winds up at irregular intervals. On three\noccasions lately the clock has run down and stopped while he has\nbeen working in his room. On each of these occasions, he has\nlooked up a few minutes before the clock has stopped and said to\nhimself, \" That clock will stop in five minutes.\"\nYesterday, the occasion of the last premonition, Mr. Peachell,\nwho thought that it was perhaps some alteration in the ticking\nnote of the clock that gave warning of the impending failure of\nthe spring, listened for some moments to the ticking, but, though\nhe has an acute ear, could detect no difference between the tick of\nthe clock as it was stopping and its tick when it was immediately\nwound up and set going again.\nThe premonitions have not occurred at regular intervals, for Mr.\nPeachell on the first two occasions neglected to wind the clock till\nsome hours afterwards.\nMr. Peachell cannot say that the clock stopped exactly five\nminutes after the premonition, but he states that the interval\nbetween the premonition and its fulfilment has not been longer\nthan ten minutes.\u2014Yours truly, J.

ARTHUR HILL.\n(Continued from the January \"Journal.\")\nIN May, 1864, Mrs. Patterson (Mrs. Eddy) paid a visit to her\nfriend and fellow-patient, Mrs. Sarah G. Crosby, at Albion,\nMaine. She was still full of Quimby, and often urged Mrs.\nCrosby to \" leave her home and go out into the world with\nher to teach Quimby's ' Science.' \" In character she was still\nthe superior sort of individual she had always been, expecting\nto be waited upon, and taking no part in the domestic routine,\nthough staying at a farm where every one took a share of\nwork. To relieve the tedium of this quiet life, Mrs. Patterson\nand Mrs. Crosby made spiritistic experiments ; the former, in\napparent trance, purported to be under the control of her\ndeceased brother Albert, who, it appeared, was Mrs. Crosby's\n\" guardian spirit.\" On the occasion of \" his \" first manifesta\ntion Mrs. Crosby was warned not to put full confidence in\nMrs. Patterson\u2014through whose lips the message was coming\u2014\nbecause, in Mrs. Crosby's words, \" she might use my sacred\nconfidence to further any ambitious purposes of her own.\"\nThis seems to suggest either that this probably fictitious per\nsonality arose from a more honourable part of Mrs. Patterson's\nmind than that which formed her supraliminal consciousness,\nor that, in her desire to convince her friend of the genuineness\nof the control, she was willing to throw some discredit on\nher own character. It is of course impossible to decide\nbetween the two explanations, but the idea of genuine trance\nis not quite incredible. It is a common thing, as observation\nhas abundantly shown, for either a hypnotic or a \" spontane\nous \" secondary personality to exhibit higher moral attributes\nthan the normal self of the subject. From the further\ndevelopments, however, it seems more reasonable to assume\nordinary trickery ; for the supposed trance-personality pro\nceeded to indicate that spirit-letters from \"Albert\" would be\nfound under a certain cushion, and, accordingly, a few letters\nwere from time to time discovered there. It would be\ninteresting to have an expert's opinion on the handwriting of\nthese epistles. To a layman, and judging from reproductions,\n\f200 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MABCH, 1908.\nit is obviously Mrs. Patterson's script, disguised by making a\nfew letters differently from her usual habit. If we wish to\nbe charitable, however, we may assume that \" Albert \" was a\nsubliminal personification analogous to \" Sally \" in Dr. Morton\nPrince's case of \" Miss Beauchamp.\" But his performances in\nthe way of letter-precipitations are very like those of \" Koot\nHoomi \" at a later date, and the same explanation will cover\nboth series of phenomena.1\nP. P. Quimby died Jan. 16, 1866, aged sixty-four. He\nsuffered from abdominal tumour, which he could not cure. Yet\nhe remained convinced of the truth of his system. So long as\nhe \" retained his mental strength,\" he said, he could hold\nhis disease at bay ; but, as he felt this slipping from him,\nhis \" error \" rapidly gained upon him. His death was widely\nmourned, and there are still many thousands of his followers\nin the States, who adhere to his teaching, claiming that, in\nits essentials, \" Christian Science \" is precisely his system. On\nhis decease, Mrs. Patterson wrote to Mr. Julius A. Dresser,\nwho was a Quimby convert and disciple, suggesting that he\nshould take up the master's work ; but for various reasons\nMr. and Mrs. Dresser did not see their way to do this. The\nfield was thus left clear.\nMrs. Patterson, however, was at this time extremely poor,\nand her health was again bad. In Jan., 1866, she had a\nfall on the ice, which brought on the old spinal trouble, and\ncomplete invalidism again loomed in front of her. However,\nshe recovered somewhat\u2014she claims to have been miraculously\ncured in a day or two by her discovery of \" Christian\nScience,\" but her letter to Mr. Dresser, and the affidavit of\nher medical attendant, Dr. Gushing, amply prove that\nthis is a mis-statement\u2014and she now seems to have made\ndefinite attempts to put on Quimby's mantle, though more in\nthe way of teaching than of healing. She visited here and\nthere among friends, mostly Spiritualists, working at manu\nscript which it was understood was to be a book on mental\nhealing : she constantly talked of Quimby, and of the way in\nwhich she meant to develop his theories. In the winter of\n1866-67 Mrs. Patterson met (at a boarding-house in Lynn) a\n'In Science and Health, p. 71, the author says: \"I never could believe in\nSpiritualism.\"\n\fMARCH, 1908. Mrs. Eddy. 201\nserious-minded shoe-worker, named Hiram Crafts. He was a\nSpiritualist, and was interested in psychic phenomena. Mrs.\nPatterson found him a willing listener, and to him her tale\nshe taught, in accordance with her custom whenever she could\nfind anybody who would attend to her harangues. Shortly\nafterwards, she went to live with the Crafts at East Stoughton\n\u2014now Avon\u2014and continued her instruction. In the spring of\n1867 Mr. and Mrs. Crafts\u2014with Mrs. Patterson\u2014went to\nTaunton, where Crafts opened an office. He was the first of\nMrs. Patterson's pupils to go into practice, and she remained\nwith him as consultant and adviser. Soon, however, domestic\nfriction occurred, in consequence\u2014it is said\u2014of Mrs. Patterson\ntrying to persuade Crafts to divorce his wife; and the wanderer\nwas again turned adrift. Her father was now dead, she had\nquarrelled with her sister Abigail, and her son was living\nwith friends who had brought him up, his mother having sent\nhim away in infancy. This last fact, of her unmotherly and\nunnatural lack of affection for her only child, is a specially\nunpleasant feature : she denies it, claiming that there was a\nplot to keep the boy from her, but there seems little doubt\nthat her statement is unreliable.\nAfter leaving the Crafts Mrs. Patterson drifted about, here\nand there, largely among Spiritualists, teaching her doctrine\nof Quimbyism to any one who would listen, and no doubt\ncontinuing to work at her manuscript. In 1870 she turned\nup again at Lynn, Mass., with a pupil named Eichard\nKennedy, a lad of nearly twenty-one. She had found that\nshe had little success in healing, but she could inspire\nenthusiasm in others by teaching. Her theories would claim\nno attention unless accompanied by practical demonstrations ;\nhence the need of working with one of her pupil-practitioners.\nAccordingly, she and Kennedy took offices in Lynn, and \" Dr.\nKennedy \" appeared on a signboard affixed to a tree.\nImmediate success crowned the venture. Patients thronged the\nwaiting-rooms. Kennedy did the \" healing,\" and Mrs. Patterson\norganised classes, the members of which were recruited from\nthe ranks of patients and their friends. The fees at first\nwere one hundred dollars for the course of twelve lessons, but\nthis was afterwards raised to three hundred dollars for a course\nof seven lessons. For the first time in her life Mrs. Patterson\n\f202 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MARCH, 1908.\nwas free from financial stress. She had got a start on the\nladder of fortune ; but she did not allow partial success to\nenervate her. Though now in her fiftieth year, she was more\nenergetic and determined than ever. She quarrelled with\nKennedy eventually, and in the spring of 1872 they separated;\nbut Mrs. Patterson was left with about six thousand dollars\nin cash as her share of the proceeds. After the separation,\nKennedy took other offices in Lynn\u2014then a town of about\nthirty thousand inhabitants\u2014and Mrs. Glover (as she was\nknown at this time) stayed at the old rooms for some months,\nafterwards moving about among friends and boarding-houses.\nAt this period she still frequented spiritualistic stances, and\nit is on record that she went into trance, purporting to be\ncontrolled by Jesus Christ or one of the Apostles ! She\nexplained that, owing to the purity of her life, no lower\nIntelligence could control her. Mrs. Eddy was never remark\nable for excessive depreciation of her own gifts and virtues ;\nthe curious thing is that she found so many people who\naccepted her at her own valuation.\nIn 1875 Mrs. Glover bought the house at No. 8 Broad\nStreet, Lynn, which became the first official headquarters of\nChristian Science. She let the first floor to various tenants,\nshe herself using only the second floor and the attia in which\nlatter low-ceiled room she completed Science and Health, and\nread its first proofs. This little room is consequently the\nshrine to which many thousands of the faithful make annual\npilgrimage. Science and Health first appeared in the year of\nher move to Broad Street, viz. 1875. Its publication was\nfinanced by two of its author's friends. Finding that it\nsecured no large sale at once\u2014the first edition was of a\nthousand copies\u2014she persuaded her chief practitioner, Daniel\nSpofford, to give up his practice and to devote himself to\nadvertising it and pushing its sale. Spofford's practice was\ntaken over by another pupil, Asa Gilbert Eddy\u2014a \" sewing-\nmachine agent\"\u2014who speedily became a favourite with her,\nand whom she married on New Year's Day, 1877.\nIn Science and Health Mrs. Eddy acknowledges no debt to\nQuimby, and indeed in other writings she calls him a\n\" mesmerist,\" denying to him the theories and methods which\n\u2014as can be shown from her own earlier letters\u2014she\n\fMARCH, 1908. Mrs. Eddy. 203\nundoubtedly learnt from him. Her egotism and masterfulness\nwere such that no second place contented her; and she\nprobably persuaded even herself, by dint of sufficient repetition,\nthat her \" discovery \" was made by direct revelation from\nGod. No reader of the book will deny that it contains much\nsensible exhortation of a moral kind, though he may deny its\noriginality. The idea of mind-cure by resolute suggestion of\nthe unreality of matter and disease she probably got from\nQuimby ; also, her rather confused notions of a metaphysical\nidealism which reduces all reality to spirit. (Both, however,\nmay have read Emerson, whose famous tract Nature\u2014pub\nlished in 1836\u2014contains a fine, though short and unacademical\npresentation of the idealist's position.) Almost the only\noriginal parts of Science and Health are those passages in\nwhich the author makes her extravagant claims.1\nMrs. Eddy made the experiment of conducting religious\nservices in Lynn in 1875. Her students wished it, and she\nreceived five dollars for each address. But the experiment\nwas not continued, and the first Christian Science Church was\nnot chartered until 1879. In 1881 she opened the \"Massa\nchusetts Metaphysical College\" in Boston, through which four\nthousand students passed in seven years ; and the tide of\nprosperity was in full flow. From the psychological point of\nview, Mrs. Eddy's life almost ceases to be interesting at this\ndate. She was sixty years old, and her mind was now fixed\nand set in its groove. The days of stress\u2014the developmental\nSturm und Drang\u2014were over ; and the history of her later\nyears is chiefly a record of how she ruled her followers and\ndefended positions already occupied.\n1 \" God had been graciously fitting me during many years for the reception of\nthis final revelation of the absolute divine Principle of scientific mental heal\ning.\" P. 107.\n\"My discovery that erring, mortal, misnamed mind produces all the\norganism and action of the mortal body, set my thoughts to work in new\nchannels, and led up to my demonstration of the proposition that mind is all\nand matter is naught as the leading factor in mind-science.\" P. 109.\n\"I won my way to absolute conclusions through divine revelation, reason,\nand demonstration.\" Ibid.\n\"To those natural Christian Scientists, the ancient worthies, and to Christ\nJesus, God certainly revealed the spirit of Christian Science, if not the\nabsolute letter.\" P. 483.\n\f204 Jowrnal of Society for Psychical Research. MARCH, 1908.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nTHE TRANCE STATE.\n(To the Editor of the JOURNAL S.P.R.).\nDEAR SIR, Feb. 23, 1908.\nIf permitted I should like to make one or two remarks\nupon a subject of great interest, but one which seems, nevertheless,\nto have been almost entirely overlooked. It is in connection with\ntrance states and the difficulties of communicating. For the sake of\nargument, then, let us assume that the intelligences that com\nmunicate through the organism of Mrs. Piper\u2014and perhaps of some\nother mediums\u2014are spirits of the departed, and that they tempor\narily \" possess \" the organism of the medium (at least in part) during\nthe process of communicating. That is the generally held theory, I\nbelieve, and the simplest one to account for the facts. If this be\ntrue it is to be supposed that the normal consciousness of the\nmedium is in some manner removed, superseded, or withdrawn, and\nthat only some \" vegetable consciousness \" remains, as it were, suffi\ncient to keep the organism going until the return of the normal\nconsciousness and normal control by the medium. Meanwhile, the\ncontrolling intelligence is, by supposition, influencing the nervous\nmechanism of the medium's body\u2014directly or indirectly through some\netheric medium\u2014and influencing it to write out letters and words\nby the usual slow and laborious process. That they do find it slow\nand laborious is evidenced by the fact that all possible abbreviations\nare adopted\u2014U.D. being used for \" Understand \" ; \" M \" is frequently\nwritten \"N,\" and so on. Even in our normal life we know that\nthoughts frequently flow faster than we can put them on to paper,\nand this would almost certainly be the case with spiritual intelli\ngences who have no material brain to hinder their flow of thought.\nIt is probable that the brain is as much an inhibitory organ as\nanything else ; and when this inhibition is removed, it is natural to\nsuppose that the flow of thought would be far less controllable and\nfar more automatic than it is with us. It would be impossible for\nspirits to check and go on with their stream of thoughts at will as\nwe do on this hypothesis ; they would be far more automatic and\nless under the control of the will. If this were true, it would\naccount for much of the confusion present in the communications.\nSuppose a spirit is trying to communicate some fact or incident in\nits past life. It is endeavouring to force this thought through, in\n\f, 1908. Correspondence. 205\nthe face of great difficulties, and while trying to retain its grasp of\nthe organism. Now, let us suppose that this stream of thought is\nsuddenly interrupted by the sitter asking an abrupt question\u2014\nreferring to another incident altogether and perhaps related to\nanother time in the communicator's life. Is it not natural to suppose\nthat, labouring under these difficulties, and lacking the inhibitory\naction of the brain, the communicator's mind should wander, and\nthat he should either think aloud to himself as it were (all\nthis coming through as confused writing, be it understood), or that\nthe spirit should lose its grasp of the organism altogether and drift\naway ? The mind cannot retain two vivid pictures at the same\ntime ; either one or the other must grow fogged and dim ; and this\nwould certainly be so in the case of any communicator, where we\nmay suppose a certain amount of mental energy\u2014corresponding to\na mental picture perhaps\u2014is necessitated in the very process of\nholding the control of the organism. If communications take place\nat all in reality, we may well suppose that the difficulties of com\nmunicating would be so great that all clear, systematic thinking\nwould -be impossible. People seem to imagine that the process of\ncommunicating is as simple as possible, instead of the most delicate\nand complicated imaginable\u2014the very difficulty being evidenced by\nthe rarity of the intelligible communications coming through. If\nany one were to try the simple subjective test of closing the eyes\nand attempting to conceive his spirit controlling some other person's\norganism, he would very easily perceive the tremendous difficulties\nin the way of controlling an organism other than his own !\nHowever, my object in writing this letter is not to point out\ndifficulties of this character, which are probably well understood by\nthe majority of the readers of this Journal. It is to draw attention\nto another fact, and an analogy. Let us take a man in good health,\nwhose brain and mental functions are normal. Let this man be all\nbut killed in a railroad accident. In the jar and shock of the\ncollision this man was thrown (let us say) against an iron post, and\nhis head badly cut and bruised. He was knocked insensible, and it\nwas several hours before he returned to the first dim consciousness of\nhis surroundings. Gradually he would revive. Objects would pre\nsent themselves to his eyesight vaguely, indistinctly ; he would \" see\nmen as trees walking.\" Sounds would be heard, but indistinctly ;\nthere would be a vague jumble of noises, and no definite and\narticulate sounds would be recognized at first, and until conscious\nness was more fully restored. Tactual sensations, smell and touch\n\f206 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MARCH, 1908.\nwould probably come last, and be least powerful of all ; they would\nnot be even distinguishable until consciousness was almost com\npletely normal. All intellectual interests would be abolished, only\nthe most loving and tender thoughts would be entertained or\ntolerable, and these would be swallowed up, very largely, in the\ngreat, central fact that the body and head was in great pain ; that\nthe memory was impaired, and that anything like normal thinking\nand a normal grasp of the organism was impossible. Thoughts\nwould be scattered, incoherent, and only the strongest stimuli would\nfocus the attention on any definite object for longer than a few-\nmoments at a time, and perhaps even these would fail. But if\noxygen gas were administered to such a person, in moderate doses,\nhe would recover and rally far more quickly and effectually than\nif no such stimuli were employed. He would rally more quickly,\nand be enabled to think more clearly and consistently\u2014at least pro\ntem. In shocks to the living consciousness this would almost\ncertainly be the case.\nNow, when we come to die, the departure of the soul from the\nbody must be a great strain and stress upon the surviving con\nsciousness, and must shock it tremendously\u2014just as the accident\nshocked it in the case given above. Certainly this would be so in\nthe case of all sudden deaths, and in those cases who \" die hard \" ;\nand it is natural to suppose that it would be true, also, more or\nless, in every case of death, however natural\u2014since the separation\nof consciousness from its brain must be the greatest shock that any\ngiven consciousness could receive in the course of its natural\nexistence. But after a time the spirit is supposed to outlive and\n\"get over\" this initial shock, and to regain its normal functions\nand faculties. In its normal life, it is then supposed to be once\nmore free and unhampered by any of the bodily conditions that\nrendered its manifestation on earth defective. But when this con\nsciousness comes once more to communicate, it seems to again take\non the conditions of earth life, i.e. those conditions which were\npresent when the person died\u2014and this would account for the facts,\noften observed, when mediums \"take on\" the conditions of certain\nspirits who are communicating, i.e. they suffer pro tem, from heart\nor bowel trouble, pains in the head, etc. Further, this seems to\nextend to the mental functions and conditions also. Idiocy and\ninsanity, e.g., are supposed to gradually wear off, in the next life,\nand a gradual return to normal conditions ensue. This is, at least,\nthe statement made through several mediums, and it is only natural\n\fMARCH, 1908. Correspondence. 207\nto suppose that such should be the case. The spirit gradually\nreturns to a normal mental condition ; but when any attempt is\nmade to return to the \" earth plane,\" and especially to communicate,\nthese conditions return with greater or lesser force\u2014varying with\nand depending upon the length of time such a person had been\ndead, and other considerations. On any theory, the consciousness\nmust undergo some sort of temporary disintegration, while communi\ncating, and must be scattered over a wide field of recollection, while\nat the same time attempting to \" hold on \" to the organism. It\nmust also be remembered that the flow of thought is far more\nautomatic than with us. All this being so, we can readily under\nstand that any attempt at communication would be attended with\nthe greatest difficulties, and such a consciousness, if it were con\nstantly interrupted with questions, etc., would tend to go to pieces\n\u2014to lose its grasp of the organism, and to drift away\u2014only con\nfusion and error coming through. This consciousness might be\nstrengthened and rendered clearer, perhaps, by the presentation of\nsome object belonging to the person when alive\u2014as, no matter how\nexplained, this seems to clear the communications. Any means that\ncan be adopted to render clearer the mind of the communicator, on\nthe one hand, or improve the condition of the nervous mechanism\nof the medium on the other, should therefore be of great utility\nand should at least be tried. This being so, I now come to the\nheart of my letter\u2014a suggestion that, if followed out, might improve\nthe physical body of the medium, and hence render the conditions\nbetter from this side\u2014as the presentation of objects might be\nsupposed to render the conditions better from the other side.\nI have pointed out before that, in certain cases, when it is\ndesirable to restore the consciousness and to render its renewal\nmore certain and clear (after an accident, e.g., that has knocked a\nperson senseless) a mixture of oxygen gas is sometimes administered\nto the patient in order to produce these results. This being so, I\nask : why may it not be a good idea to administer a diluted mixture\nof this gas to the medium when she is in a trance state\u2014and\nwhen a communicator is attemping to convey his thought to the\nsitter by means of automatic writing? Might not such an experi\nment be tried, since no harm can come to the medium if the oxygen\nbe diluted and only sufficiently strong to effect the desired results ?\nAnd might not its administration tend to improve the tone of the\nnervous system pro tem., and render clearer the consciousness that\nis trying to use it and manifest through it\u2014just as one's own con\n\f208 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MARCH, 1908.\nsciousness might be rendered clearer by the same device ? Of course\nsuch a process might have the effect (especially at first) of breaking\nthe trance altogether, and of reviving the medium. But if the\nmedium understood the experiment beforehand, and the process was\nalso explained to the controls, it is reasonable to suppose that\u2014 after\nsome trials at any rate\u2014the trance would not be broken, and that\nbetter, clearer results would follow. At all events, when some of\nour physicians in America are experimenting upon the effects of\nvarious electrical rays upon mediums in a trance, might not this\nfar simpler and better-understood method be tried with more or\nless impunity 1 I at least suggest that it be so tried.\nVery truly yours,\nHEREWAKD CARRINGTON.\nENDOWMENT FUND FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH,\nACCOUNT FOR 1907.\nRECEIVED.\nBalance in band, December 31st,\n1906, \u00a3410 7 4\nInterest on Investments, - 221 15 1\n\u00a3632 2 5\nPAID.\nPurchase of \u00a3260 Caledonian\nRailway 4 % Preference Shares, \u00a3300 17 3\nPurchase of \u00a3260 East Indian\nRailway 3i % Debenture Stock, 250 11 6\nCheque Book, - - - - 016\nBalance in hand, December 31st,\n1907, 80 12 2\n\u00a3632 2 5\nJ.

He\nhas made some remarkable hits, which might be attributed to tele\npathy or to communication from the dead ; but he receives such a\nmass of messages, many of which cannot be verified, and his spirits\nare so addicted to prophecy, in which they have indifferent success,\nthat I have never felt that his successes could be justly estimated\nwithout a complete study of the case (CL la Piper), a task for which\nI have neither time nor opportunity, and have therefore never\nreported anything to the Society.\nMr. E. told me of his appearance to Mr. and Mrs. E. the morning\nafter the occurrence, having heard it from Mr. E.

I wondered\nhow he had got in without ringing and without being heard, but\nthe image was so lifelike that I did not for an instant suspect a\nhallucination, and exclaiming \"There is T. now,\" I arose and went\nto meet him.

APRIL, 1908.\nthe solution of a mysterious experience which has recently occurred\nto me, or in my presence.\nOn the 16th of June (Monday), of the present year, accompanied\nby a lady friend, Miss Loop, of Gt. Harrington, I left that place\nto pay a visit to a lady living in the village of Burnt Hills,\nSaratoga Co., N. York. In order to reach this place, as illustrating\nits remoteness of connexion with Gt. B., I will say that we were\nobliged to make five changes of cars, leaving the railroad finally\nat Ballston Lake, and from there taking a drive of about 1\u00a3 miles.\nWe remained one week, and during that time never met any person\nwhom we ever met before or who had to our knowledge ever been\nin Gt. Barrington, or know any one from that place. The lady\nwhom we visited, Mrs. Orcutt, is, of course, excepted. We arrived\nthere at about 5 p.m. Monday the 16th. Wednesday p.m. the\n18th, it being rainy, my friends interested themselves much in cards,\nin which games I did not join. In the evening the games were\nresumed, and did not appear to come out satisfactorily, both parties\nremaining somewhat puzzled and preoccupied. (I mention this for a\nreason.) About 10 p.m. Mrs. 0. said, \"This is dull for Mrs. B.\nAs she says she is somewhat interested in 'Ouija' perhaps she\nwould like to see it move a little.\" Here I may say that I have\nno power over the Ouija or any form of automatic writing, and\nhave never in my life attended a seance, or consulted any medium.\nMiss Loop and Mrs. Orcutt appear to have power to move Ouija,\nbut neither of them is specially interested. Mrs. O. dislikes to use it,\nand on this occasion specially Miss L. protested. \"No, it is too\nlate, I am tired, and I don't feel in any mood to try it. I can\nonly think about the strange way those cards came out, etc.\"\nMrs. 0. did not own a board, but sent over that p.m. and borrowed\none for my benefit, but it had not been touched until then. I said\nI did not care to have them try it too late, etc. But they put\ntheir hands listlessly upon the board, and immediately it moved, with\ngreat rapidity, so fast indeed that none of us could follow its\nmeaning. Miss Loop said, \" It is evidently doing nothing. Let\nus stop.\" However, I said, \"I will get paper and pencil, and try\nto take down some letters. Perhaps we may make something yet.\"\nAfter some delay in getting paper ready\u2014Ouija meantime going on\nrapidly\u2014I took down about a line and a half, incoherent from start,\nand then the following, not deciphering the message until some minutes\nafter I had written the letters : \" Charles Booth is just been giving\nPittsfield a visit. Did you know it or not t \"\n\fAPRIL, 1908. Oases. 213\nThen followed a message purporting to be from my deceased son,\nwhich was apparently intended to be verified as such by the above\ngiven message, used as a test. Now I can furnish you with the\npositive statements of all parties concerned that no one, or either\nof us had any such idea in our minds or even caught the message\nas it was being written by Ouija. No one of us had any reason\nwhatever to think of such a thing or any knowledge about Charles\nBooth's visiting Pittsfield, and we all exclaimed \" How queer ! It\nis not at all likely to be true.\" Nor did we have any idea what\ntime was referred to for the visit. When I went home the next\nweek, I asked my son if he had been away from home during my\nabsence (without mentioning the incident). \"No,\" he said. \"Have\nyou not been anywhere?\" \"No. Why do you ask?\" \"Oh,\" I\nsaid, \"I only just picked up here on the balcony a Pitts, evening\npaper, etc. ; did not know but you had been there.\" \" Oh,\" my\nson said, \"I just went up to Pittsfield, a flying visit, the very day,\nMonday, you went away. I went up at 2 p.m. and came back at\n5 p.m. Went on masonic business. Didn't think of that.\"\nI should say here that my son does not believe in Spiritualism\nand has an intense dislike for it,\u2014including Ouija, and all forms\nof mediumship and \" occult \" things generally. He is of specially\nquiet, gentle, reserved temperament, and never announces beforehand\nhis intentions, comings or goings. When I told him the circumstance,\nhe looked astonished, and when I asked him what he thought of it,\nhe said, \" I think nothing about it. I don't know what it is, nor\ndoes any one else know, but whatever it is, it is disagreeable. I\ndon't like it.\" I will say here that I do not share his dislike.\nI have written at great length because I did not know what to\nretrench from these details in a matter which (apparently trivial)\nimpresses me, taken in connexion with some previous experiences, as\nof very great importance.\nI cannot rest until I get some opinion of your Society about it.\nI have very special reasons for being greatly interested in your Society,\nand in what I hope may be its outcome, the overthrow of a gross\nmaterialism, the scientific proof of the reality, and the independence\nof mind over matter. I have read with interest all the Society's\npublications for the past two years, also Prof. Newbold's Articles\nin Pop. Science (except the last), but I most respectfully submit\nthat the hypothesis offered by Prof. N. does not cover this case (or\nfor that matter the majority of cases). As I understand the matter\nit could neither have been telepathy or clairvoyance. It was not\n\f214 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1908.\ncontemporaneous. I have a crude theory of my own, which I submit\nwith all diffidence. Of course I am entirely unscientific. The sub\nliminal consciousness may be roughly regarded as a rim surrounding\nand projecting beyond the circumference of the normal ordinary\nconsciousness into a transcendent universe.\nUpon this projected consciousness may be from time to time de\nposited (so to speak) intelligence of past or coming events, inspira\ntions, consolations, or demoniac suggestions, or trivialities in various\nforms. The impact of these various deposits constitutes a mysterious\nforce which conveys them to the upper consciousness, or impresses\nthem through the nervous system upon material things. The nature\nof this force and the mode of its action are unknown. Now these\nvarious deposits are from various sources, all supernormal, some tele\npathic from discarnate spirits, and as various in character as are the\ndifferent sources from whence they proceed ; conditioned also, more\nor less, in ways we cannot comprehend, by the medium through\nwhom they pass. Many are from weak, foolish spirits,\u2014many from\nevil ones,\u2014some from dear friends departed, and even from angelic\nministrants,\u2014and finally many are inspirations,\u2014and answers to our\nprayers and aspirations from the Infinite Spirit, \" In whom we live\nand move, and have our being.\" The subliminal consciousness, what\never else it may be and whatever may be its functions, may yet be\nthe medium of communication with other minds without the inter\nvention of the brain. (MRg }\nGx. HARRINGTON, Oct. 1th, 1896.\nDR. RICHARD HODGSON,\nDear Sir,\u2014Your letter of Sept. 30th was duly received. I have\nsent a copy of it to my friend Mrs. Orcutt of Burnt Hills, asking\nher to furnish a statement such as you wish. I have also shown\nyour letter to Miss Loop, and she will also give you her statement.\nMy son will also testify as to his going to Pittsfield, etc. I will\nforward them all to you as soon as received. I certainly did not\nhave my hands on the Ouija board. The incident seems to me\nto be one of a series of messages. We have had none since. It\nwill be impossible to have more with Mrs. Orcutt. I hope Miss\nLoop may have some results with another lady, a very intelligent\nperson who is anxious to try for results.\nI will, after a little while, send you the identical paper on which\nI wrote the Ouija message about Pittsfield. Since writing you last,\n\fAPRIL, 1908. Cases. 215\nI have discovered on the first line what I think may be intended\nfor \"E. Ferry,\" but I did not discover it until then, nor did Miss\nL. or Mrs. 0. I will send you the paper, and you can judge for\nyourself. It is written thus in the paper\u2014eferey\u2014and follows other\nletters as if it were at the close of a sentence. I cannot account\nfor errors in spelling or grammar. In rapid movements of Ouija,\nthe letter is often doubled almost imperceptibly, and so it was\nprobably double r. When one, not an expert, tries to render a\nstrain of music on a piano they often strike false notes (letters)\nwithout intending to do so. The medium probably conditions in\nsome respects unconsciously the message unknown to us, that is,\nits condition, not its substance. If the last message was from Mr.\nFerry, it makes the identity of the other very probable.\nYours very sincerely,\nLUCY C. BOOTH.\nGT. BARRINGTON, Oct. llth, 1896.\nDR. EICHARD HODGSON,\nDear Sir,\u2014I enclose the statements which you wish, also the\nidentical paper jiist as I wrote it down from Ouija, on the evening\nof June 18th last. You will thus see that Mrs. Orcutt was a\nlittle at fault in her memory of the message. As she kept no\nrecord, it is not, I think, strange that she should not be accurate.\nYou will no doubt notice all the minor discrepancies in the\nstatements. I sat near the board, but not in contact with it, near\nenough to see by the light of a shaded lamp. I cannot remember\nprecisely who first proposed Ouija.\nMrs. Orcutt quite likely called out some of the letters, but I\nalso watched the board. Miss L. I am sure paid very little heed\nand was only anxious to get through. She thought it was spelling\nnothing. Mrs. Orcutt did not, nor did I, read any words until\nall was finished, but she caught the last word Orcutt, her own\nname, because Miss Loop stopped Ouija taking off her hands and\nMrs. 0. said, \"Oh I think it is saying something or going to, for\nI have just seen my name.\" There is something to be said about\nthe last message. They commenced again, and then we all caught\nthe last message as it was coming on the board. Mrs. 0. was\nvery kind to my son Le Roy, whom she met when he was an\ninvalid in a Southern City and he visited her at Burnt Hills, and\nafterwards she helped me to nurse him in that same city in his\nlast illness, consequently he was attached to her. We had both\n\f216 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Now\nthat fact counts, as you will see, neither for or against the spiritual\nistic theory.\nI think the t in Pittsfield was undoubtedly doubled. If I had\nread the word I should doubtless have seen it doubled.\nYours respectfully,\nLUCY C. BOOTH.\nP.S.\u2014Where a letter is inserted there was a slight hesitancy\u2014\nwhere in parenthesis, doubtful.

We com\nmenced about ten o'clock (if I remember). Ouija moved readily\u2014\nat random\u2014and I proposed stopping. The letters were towards\nMrs. O. and my hands nearly concealed them from my view. I had\nnothing in mind, and was not on the alert for letters or words.\nMrs. Booth was interested, sat near, and wrote the letters as they\ncame. She has the exact sentence\u2014I think it was this : Charles\nBooth is just given Pittsfield a visit, did you know it or not?\nI had not seen Mr. Booth for some time before we left Gt. B.\nand knew nothing whatever of him or his plans. He is a very\nreticent, reserved man, and one whom I seldom meet. Neither Mrs.\nBooth nor I had heard from home.

I write fully in regard to him, that\nyou may know how very unexpected and \" accidental \" this message\nwas.

H. BOOTH.\n\f218 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1908.\nSOME MYSTERIOUS RAPPINGS EXPLAINED.\nTHE following account is contributed by a correspondent who has\nlong been interested in Psychical Eesearch :\nJuly 1st, 1907.\nRather more than a year ago I awoke suddenly one morning\nabout 3 o'clock hearing \" raps \" in my room. My first impression\nwas that they were in the floor at the side of the bed, and in the\nwall a few feet off parallel with it, and that I had been awakened\nby their violence. For some minutes after waking I was quite sure\nthat they were in the floor, but after I had switched on the electric\nlight and listened further, it was obvious that they were only in\nthe wall, which was a partition formed of a wooden framework\ncovered with canvas and papered, and hung with a light bookshelf,\nand a few pictures and photo-frames. The raps occurred in different\nparts of it\u2014sometimes singly, but generally in groups of from 2 to\n5 taps, which were clear and distinct, as if made with the end of\na pencil. They lasted for more than an hour, when they gradually\nbecame fainter and less frequent, and ceased. I examined the wall\nand the furniture near it, but could find nothing to account for them.\nThe following night the raps commenced a few minutes after I\nhad switched off the light. As on the preceding night, they appeared\nto be insistent and animated, and I realised that I was thinking\nthat they were due to supernormal agency. When I had convinced\nmyself of the probable absurdity of this and the greater likelihood\nof their being due to something in the hollow partition, the raps\nbecame mechanical and lifeless\u2014proving that their animated and\ninsistent character had been purely subjective. They continued for\na short time, became fainter and ceased.\nAfter this, I heard them at irregular intervals for some weeks,\nand they were always clear and distinct. One morning\u2014the first\ntime, I think, that I heard them in the day-time\u2014I succeeded in\nlocating one group, and standing on a chair I saw the papered\ncanva13 covering move outwards, away from the wooden framework, in\nlittle jerks along one of the nails in the wall, each little jerk making\na rap through the rubbing of the canvas on the nail. The move\nment was so slight that it could not be seen by any one standing\non the floor; but when I was near enough to the nails in the\ndifferent parts of the wall to examine them closely, it was perfectly\nclear to me that they were the means by which the \"raps\" were\nproduced. The irregular recurrences of the rappings and the vary\n\fAPBIL, 1908. Some Mysterious Rappings Explained. 219\ning degrees of force with which they occurred were due, no doubt,\nto certain conditions of the wind, and to its means of access to the\npartition, either in my room or in the one on the other side of it.\nN. I.\nAUTOMATIC TELEGEAPHY.\nTHE following short account by a young officer of Marines of an\nearly experience of his when learning wireless telegraphy is, as\nan illustration of automatism, obviously analogous to the more\nfamiliar phenomena of ouija or planchette writing. We are\nasked not to publish the names of our correspondents ; the case\nis sent by Mrs. E., an Associate of the Society, who writes :\n1st Feb., 1908.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014I handed your note of Jan. 27, with reference to the\nexperiences of operators in wireless telegraphy, to my nephew,\nH. T. G., who wrote to his friend M. C.'s mother on the subject.\nI enclose her reply to him and the extracts from M. C.'s letter\ndescribing his experience. On receiving these I wrote to Mrs. C.,\nwhom I do not know personally, asking her to date the extracts\nand also to permit you to enter into direct correspondence with her,\nas I hear from my nephew that she has herself tried automatic\nwriting and is much interested in the matter. I enclose her reply.\nM. C. has been here with my nephew, when he was at home\non leave. He is an able, rising young officer, and now an expert\ntelegraphist. I was much struck by his description of the curious\nintensification of auditory power which wireless experts attain. In\nthe open sea what is silence to other men is to them broken at\ntimes by strange sounds which they cannot describe or explain.\nM. W.

Of course you can adjust the space\nA to what size you like. If you are skilful, and have a very fine\ntouch, you have it very small indeed. Yesterday I was transmitting\nat about 40 to 50 words a minute, and proposed to go a little\nV.\nquicker, so I kept on screwing down to a smaller and smaller space.\nWhen the space was almost infinitesimal I stopped working for a\nminute, and started reading the book I was sending from, to see\nwhat came next. Suddenly, while my hand was on it, the key\nstarted transmitting at an extraordinary speed, I should judge about\n400 words a minute. The yeoman of signals at the other end said\nit was much too fast for him to read. I knew what it was, as I\nwas doing it. It was simply the words in the book I was reading.\nI asked the yeoman what this meant. He said it was quite common,\nand was merely your nerves working the key at an extraordinary\nfine adjustment. He said no one but the sender could ever read\nthe message, as you transmitted it at exactly the same pace as you\nwere reading. It seems to me that this is a very concrete explana\ntion of all the involuntary motion on planchette, etc.\nDE. J. D. QUACKENBOS' \"HYPNOTIC THERAPEUTICS IN\nTHEORY AND PRACTICE.\"\nIN a book which has just appeared, by Dr. John Duncan Quac-\nkenbos, Hypnotic Therapeutics in Theory and Practice, the author\ngives some valuable illustrations of clairvoyance and other super\nnormal faculties. The most striking case is that of Anna Fortwanger,\na peasant girl of Southern Germany, ignorant of English, who was\nbrought in November, 1904, to the author's office in New York by\nher employer, who was at the time a member of the English S.P.R.\nThe girl's master then and there threw her into a hypnotic sleep,\nthe genuineness of which was tested by various methods. The girl\nwas then directed to proceed (\"in the Spirit,\" that is) out of the\nroom, to pass up two flights of stairs, to enter a large front room\nwith an alcove in it, and to describe what she saw there. Neither\nthe girl nor her employer had ever been in the house before.\nThe directions and the questions were all put in German by the\nhypnotiser, and the answers were of course also in that language.\n\fAPRIL, 1908.

The boy asserted in the hypnotic state\nthat he could see the bones in the human body. He furnished\nvarious proofs of that faculty. In one case, quoted at length by\nDr. Quackenbos, the boy was asked to examine a young man's arm.\nMore than a year previously the man had sustained a severe shoot\ning accident\u2014some hundreds of small pellets having lodged in his\narm. Most of them had been removed, but the X-rays still showed\nsome remaining. The boy, knowing nothing of the accident, saw\nmany small holes in the arm : the holes, it appeared on close\ninquiry, corresponded in position with the pellets as shown by the\nX-rays.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nMRS. PIPER'S TRANCES.\n3rd April, 1908.\n(To the Editor of the JOURNAL S.P.R.).\nDEAR SIR,\u2014I should like, though rather late in the day, to draw\nattention to a statement contained in the \" Report of the Council\nfor 1907 \" (Journal for February, p. 187) which is likely to convey\nan erroneous impression.\nIt is there stated that Mrs. Piper during her recent stay in Eng\nland gave seventy-four sittings of an average duration of two hours\n\fAPRIL, 1908. Correspondence. 223\nand a half. The word \" sitting \" is ambiguous, but I imagine it was\nused to mean the trance, or, if not so used, that at least it would\ngenerally be taken in that sense.\nAs a matter of fact the average duration of the trance did not\nexceed two hours. I should be glad if you would insert this ex\nplanation, not only because I promised Mrs. Piper that the trance\nshould not exceed two hours, but also because, even had no such\npromise been given, I am strongly of opinion that to exceed that\nlimit is inadvisable. Indeed, I think it would be wise to reduce\nthe duration of Mrs. Piper's trance to an hour and three-quarters.\u2014\nYours faithfully, j_ G> pIDDINGTON.\nSUPPLEMENTAEY LIBRARY CATALOGUE.\nBooks added to the Library since the last List, JOURNAL for December, 1906.\n*Aksakof (A.), Animisme et Spiritisms.

Apparition seen soon after death.\nThis case was sent to Professor Barrett, who read a report\non it at the private meeting of the Society held on March 30th.\nHe received it from his friend MacLeod of MacLeod, who\nwas a friend and superior officer of the subject of this narrative,\nwho is here called Capt. Arthur Oldham.1\nIn the obituary notice of Capt. Oldham which appeared in\nthe Field shortly after his death, he is described as a very\nfine specimen of an English gentleman, and \" the greatest\nelephant hunter of this or any age.\" A pioneer in African\ntravel, he made himself respected and honoured, not only by\nhis friends, but by the negro tribes among whom he went, for\nhe treated all, down to the very humblest, with courtesy and\nstraightforwardness.\nOn May 29th, 1907, Capt. Oldham shot himself in London,\nthe funeral taking place on the following Saturday. He had\nconfided a love affair to a personal friend of his, here\ncalled Mrs. Wilson. It was known to Mrs. Wilson that\nthree or four days before his tragic death he had proposed to\na lady, and doubtless his mind became unhinged upon re\nceiving her reply, refusing him, on the day he died. His\nwill was found on the mantel-piece of his room, unwitnessed,\nand apparently written just before his death. In his will he\nbequeathed an annuity to his godchild, Minnie, Mrs. Wilson's\ndaughter, who was a great favourite of his.\nMiss Minnie Wilson, though not a Eoman Catholic, was\nbeing educated in a convent school on the Continent. Her\nmother was anxious to spare her the shock of hearing of the\nsudden death of her godfather, to whom she was much\nattached, and whom she always called ' Uncle.' She did not\nwrite to her until the Tuesday, nearly a week after his\ndeath, and only told her that her uncle had died suddenly on\nthe preceding Wednesday and had been buried on Saturday.\nOn the 6th August, when Mrs. Wilson met her daughter,\nwho was 17 years old, at Charing Cross, on her return for\nthe holidays, almost the first thing Minnie said was, \"Mother,\nplease tell me the truth about Uncle Oldham.\" Mrs. Wilson's\n1 All names of persons and places are pseudonyms.\n\fMAY, 1908. Cases. 229\nletter, dated September 4th, 1907, giving an account of this\nconversation, continues as follows :\nI said, \"What do you mean, dear?\" She then said, \"You can't\ndeceive me, mother ! Just tell me ! Did he take his own life\nbecause a woman wouldn't love him 1\" I said, \" Why do you ask\nsuch a question 1 \" She replied, \" Oh, mother, do tell me the truth.\nHe came and told me all about it himself, and is suffering so\nterribly.\"\nMrs. Wilson continues :\nMinnie then gave me the following account. On the Saturday\nmorning she was in the church dusting with Mere Columba. She\nwas up a short ladder dusting a statue when she looked round\nand saw one of her school friends, whom she knew to be away at\nthe time, coming towards her; she felt great surprise and almost\nshock at seeing her friend in nun's dress.1 The young nun came\nup to her, beckoned to her to come down. She tells me that it\nwas a curious, funny feeling; she saw herself on the ladder and\nyet she was on the ground. The nun then took her by the arm\nand led her away through a side door of the church, where she\nhad never been before, and through the nuns' refectory, where no\none is allowed, and then.ce into their private Chapel, and brought\nher to one of the pews. She can describe everything, even one\nof the pictures on the walls of the refectory, which appeared to\nhave several pieces of red tape hanging from a figure in the\npicture, and which she had not seen before, but subsequently was\nfound to have correctly described. She knelt and felt some\none near her : she looked up and she says, there was Uncle Old-\nham standing by her. Her first thoughts were, Mother never told\nme he was coming over to Belgium. But she felt something was\nwrong, his face bore such terrible suffering. He came up and placed\nhis hand in hers and said : \" Minnie ! I have done a terrible thing.\nI have taken my own life because a woman would not love me,\nand I am suffering much. I never believed what I ought to have\non earth. Pray for me.\" He told her he was in need of earthly\nprayers; they helped him. She then prayed, and after that the\nsame nun came and led her out of church and she found herself on\nthe ladder dazed. She managed to get down, when Mere Columba\n1 This girl friend had left the convent soon after Minnie went there. She\nwas subsequently informed that this girl had taken the veil at that time.\n\f230 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1908.\nnoticed she looked very white and ill, took her away, and she lay\ndown for some hours. Since then the figure has appeared to her\nevery morning early, about 4 to 5, but only momentarily. He has\nnever spoken again, but each time his expression changed and a\nhappier look came on his face. Her words were : \" Oh, mother,\nI have prayed so, I want to forget the awful look on his face\nwhen I first saw him. That look is going now.\" He came to\nher as usual the day she left, but nothing has been seen here in\nLondon. The child seems to take it very calmly. What worried\nher so terribly was not knowing the truth. She dared not write to\nask me about it, as all their letters are read, and so she had to wait\nuntil she came home. The phantom told her everything : all \/ had\nintended she should never know. There is no one over there who\nknows anything about either him or ourselves. Each morning between\nthe two bells he stands by her bedside and makes her understand\nhe is happier, but he never speaks now. A bell rings when the\nnuns get up, and another when the girls rise about 4 to 5 a.m.\nIn subsequent letters dated September 15th and October\nllth, 1907, Mrs. Wilson writes:\nI have been questioning her [Minnie] again about the matter.\nI don't think it was a dream at all. I expect the whole thing was\nonly a matter of moments. When she told Mere Columba where\nshe had been and what she had seen, her friend replied, \" Child,\nyou are ill,\" and made no comment. I suppose she went into a\ntrance condition, but it must have been of very short duration, as\nMere Columba noticed nothing. There are many other points I\nshould myself like to find out; one is to see the girl who came\nas a nun, to know if anything strange happened to her at the\ntime.\nShe [Minnie] has not seen anything at all since her return to\nEngland. He appeared to her first as he always did in his ordinary\nclothes. I asked her if she felt frightened. Her reply was: \"Why,\nmother, I did not know he was dead, and I did not believe it, but\nhis face was so sad, I knew something was wrong. I thought it\nwas really uncle speaking to me ! \" She saw him distinctly every\nmorning, but he never spoke. He made her understand what he\nwanted; that was only momentary. She tells me she is trying to\nforget it all now. The suspense told on her considerably ; a weight\nseemed lifted when she heard the truth from me. I can only con\nclude that the convent being a peaceful, sacred place, Arthur felt\n\fMAY, 1908. Cases. '231\ndrawn to the child. He was always so fond of her and felt her\ninnocent prayers would help him.\nIn reply to enquiries as to whether it was possible her\ndaughter had seen a telegraphic report of her godfather's death\nin some newspaper, Mrs. Wilson wrote, February 26th, 1908:\nI think the idea of my daughter having unconsciously seen a\nnewspaper can be put aside ; I have thought of that too, but I\nknow how strict the nuns are at that Convent\u2014no newspapers are\nallowed, and all letters are read before they are delivered. The\ndeath took place on the Wednesday, the apparition appeared on\nthe Saturday, and not until the following Wednesday did my\ndaughter receive my few words, telling her he had died suddenly.\nProfessor Barrett intended going to the continent to try to\nget an interview with Mere Columba, as her evidence would\nbe important, and also with the young nun, but Mrs. Wilson\nwrote on February 20th, 1908:\nI am afraid no information can be obtained at the Convent, as\nMinnie only confided in old Mere Columba in great secrecy, and\nshe, I hear, has recently died ; I doubt if she ever mentioned the\ncircumstance to any one.\nA brother of Capt, Oldham writes, after giving details con\ncerning the annuity bequeathed to Minnie in the will found\nafter his brother's death :\nIt is a pity that Mere Columba is dead. It would be of great\nimportance to get hold of the girl who took Minnie to Arthur\nOldham. We do not know if she, in the flesh, was conscious of\nanything, but being a nun it is probably difficult to get at her.\nShe is not in the same Convent.\nThe foregoing narrative was submitted to Mrs. Wilson, who\nread it carefully, and after making one or two verbal corrections,\nreturned it to Professor Barrett with her own and her daughter's\nsignature, stating:\nMarch 15th, 1908.\nWe have read the foregoing, it is strictly correct.\n(Signed) A. W.\nM. W.\n\f232 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1908.\nThe following is Miss Minnie Wilson's own account of her\nexperience :\nMarch 15th, 1908.\nOne Saturday morning I was in the church helping Mere Columba\nto dust. I was up a ladder dusting a statue when I was rather\nsurprised to see a girl, who had left some time, dressed as a nun,\ncome towards me, and beckon me to follow her ; it gave me rather\na shock to see myself on the ladder when I was in the act of follow\ning the nun. Passing through a door I reached the chapel by a way\nI had never been before. When I was kneeling in one of the pews,\nI was very surprised to see Uncle Oldham come up to me, as mother\nhad not told me he was coming to Belgium. I thought something\nwas wrong as he had such a pained expression ; he took my hand\nand said he had done something very wrong1 and that it would\nhelp him a great deal to have me to pray for him ; then he told me\nhe had been refused by the woman he loved and that he had shot\nhimself in his despair; after that he visited me every morning.\nWhen I found myself again on the ladder I must have looked\nrather pale, so Mere Columba made me lie down for some time ;\nlater on I told her I had seen my uncle and that he had shot himself,\nbut she only said it was my imagination. I made her promise not\nto tell any one, as I knew no one would believe it and thought I\nshould be laughed at; a few days after I heard from mother that\nUncle Oldham had died suddenly. It gave me a shock, as I did\nnot know who to believe and could not write, as all letters are\nread before leaving the convent. I only heard the truth from\nmother when I came home. MINNIE WILSON.\nProfessor Barrett adds :\n\" The foregoing case is in my opinion one of the most\ninteresting and impressive of the many cases of phantasms of\nthe dead that have ever come under my notice. Knowing as\nI do the young percipient and her absolute truthfulness, trans\nparent sincerity and bright intelligence, I am convinced of\nthe substantial accuracy of the story she has told. Moreover\nthe fact of her being secluded in a convent school when the\napparition occurred,\u2014a place in which no news of the outside\nworld is allowed to percolate, except through letters from\nrelatives which are previously opened and read,\u2014this in itself\nrenders the case almost an ideal one, and it would have been\nwholly so had Mere Columba lived a little longer, so that her\n\fMAY, 1908. Gases. 233\nconfirmation of the story and date of the apparition had been\nobtained. Nor do I see how any explanation of the case can\nbe based on telepathy from the living except by making\nassumptions which are more difficult to accept than the\nhypothesis of the conscious survival \u2022 of the personality for\n(at any rate) a certain period after the death of the body.\"\nAfter Professor Barrett had finished reading the account of\nthis case at the meeting of the Society, Miss Wilson, who was\npresent, went on to the platform and submitted to a somewhat\nrigorous cross-examination at the hands of several members of\nthe audience. Miss Wilson stood the ordeal very well, and the\naudience was obviously impressed by the simple straight\nforwardness of her replies. She stated that she did not\nknow the lady who was said to have refused her uncle's\noffer of marriage, nor had she heard anything of her uncle's\nlove affair. Asked if the nun whose phantom conducted her\nthrough the refectory to the chapel had ever been in the re\nfectory while she was at the convent school, she replied that the\nsenior girls who got the chief prizes always went there to\nreceive them at the end of their last term at school, so un\ndoubtedly this nun, who had had a distinguished career at\nschool, must have been there. Asked with regard to the\npicture with red tape hanging from it seen by her in her\nvision, she said that when she went into the refectory to\nreceive a prize at the end of the term two months after the\nvision, she looked for this picture and found that it was really\nthe picture of a saint dripping with blood. She was sure that\nthe nun who conducted her in her vision had no knowledge of\nher uncle. With regard to the scene in the Chapel, she said that\nshe felt her uncle touch her hand : she was not sure whether she\nheard words, but she certainly thought she did. She noticed\nthat she did not hear him walk up the aisle, and especially\nthat he did not make the bench creak, as other people did.\nAfterwards when the figure appeared to her in the morning\nstanding at the bedside it gradually faded away. She said\nshe felt something that woke her up and made her look. In\nthese morning visits, which went on for two months, the\napparition never spoke to her, but as time went on its\nexpression gradually became less unhappy.\nReferring to her being led through the refectory by the\n\f234 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1908.\nnun, she said she only noticed that she had to do as she\nwas told, though it was not quite characteristic of her to like\nto be told to do things. She did not notice anything about\nthe journey back, and did not again see herself on the ladder.\nIt was not at all strange that her uncle should ask her to\npray for him, as in Catholic schools girls are taught to pray\nregularly for the dead. She was not on exceptionally friendly\nterms with the nun, who was her senior, though they liked\neach other. They did not see much of each other, as the\nnun came from a different country, and the different nation\nalities were kept rather apart. Her mother, she he'ard afterwards,\nhad known something about Captain Oldham's love affair.\nL. 1170. Apparition at time of death.\nTHE following case was contributed to the American Branch by\nDr. Savage. Miss Gollin, sitting in her office, saw her fiance\nstanding behind her chair. She asked a friend sitting near\nher if she saw him ; she had not, but she testifies as to the\nincident having occurred as stated by Miss Gollin. The young\nman had died at about the time he was seen by her. Two\nfurther experiences of Miss Gollin's are of interest and are\nappended.\nHer first account was as follows :\n130 LAFAYETTE AVENUE,\nREV. DR. SAVAGE, BROOKLYN, March 2nd, 1905.\nNew York City.\nDear Sir,\u2014During a discussion upon the subject of Psychical\nEesearch with a friend a short time ago I mentioned a little\nincident in my own life. This friend advised me to send the facts\nto you, saying you were very much interested in this subject, and\nto his way of thinking my experience seemed to be a perfect case.\nIt is for this reason I am taking the liberty of addressing you.\nDuring the year 1896 I was employed in the office of a certain\nnewspaper in this city. On Saturday, the 25th of Jan., 1896, at\nabout 12.30 p.m., while attending to my work, all at once I felt\nconscious of a presence near me. In fact, it was just the same\nfeeling one has when some one is intently looking at you, and you\nfeel an inclination to turn to see who it is. This feeling was so\nstrong that I turned almost involuntarily, and there at the back of\n\fMAY, 1908. Qases. 235\nmy chair, but a little to one side, I saw the full figure of a young\nman with whom I was well acquainted\u2014in fact, engaged to marry.\n(I wish to state here that this young man had never been in this\noffice.) The figure was very distinct. In fact, it was all so plain\nthat I felt the young woman sitting next to me must see it also,\nand though very much overcome and not understanding it at the\ntime, I turned to her and asked, Did you see any one just now\nstanding back of my chair? She replied No, and, of course, won\ndered why I asked. I did not explain my reason to her at the\ntime as, though she knew this person from hearsay, she had no\nacquaintance, and I felt she might think me foolish. However, the\nincident is perfectly clear in her mind even to this day, and if\nnecessary I can furnish her name and address. In fact, it is her\nhusband who prevailed on me to make this communication to you.\nOn the previous Sunday to this incident I had been at church\nwith this young man, and he was, apparently, in very good health,\nthough previously he had been ailing somewhat, we thought from\noverstudy, as he was just completing a college course. That evening\nafter our return from church he made an engagement to see me\nthe middle of the week. Instead of seeing me, I received a letter\nfrom his sister saying he had a cold and might not come to see me\nuntil the end of the week, but that it was nothing serious. I wrote\nback, saying that as the weather was so bad he had probably better\nnot try to come to see me until the Sunday following. (That week\nwe had a great deal of wet weather.) I heard nothing further from\nany member of the family and fully expected to see him on Sunday.\nOn reaching home on Saturday, Jan. 25, 1896, I found a telegram\nwaiting for me, which read : \" If you wish to see W. come at\nonce.\" I did not reach home until about 2 p.m. I hurried to his\nhome, and on arriving was told he had died about 12.30. It was\na case of typhoid fever.\nThe delay in forwarding this letter is the result of my desire to\nlook over some old documents and thus make sure of the exact date\nof this strange phenomena. A. A. GOLLIN.\nMiss Gollin afterwards wrote to Dr. Hodgson :\n130 LAFAYETTE AVE.,\nBROOKLYN, March 20, 1905.\nRICHARD HODGSON, ESQ., LL.D.,\nSec. and Treas. Society for Psychical Research, Boston, Mass.\nDear Sir,\u2014It has given me great pleasure to receive yours of\nthe llth and to know that you are interested in my experience.\n\f236 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1908.\nI have been very busy, else I should have answered your questions\nat an earlier date. Now, however, I will try to the best of my\nability to give you the information you desire.\nFirst, the name of my friend is Mrs. B. L. Burrows, 179 Pros\npect Park, West, Brooklyn, N.Y. She, however, did not see the\napparition, but distinctly remembers my asking if she saw any one\nat the back of my chair, and will recall the circumstances, as we\nhave often spoken of the incident since.\nI did not make any record of the occurrence, but the whole\naffair was so very vivid it has been impressed upon my memory,\nand after the death of my friend I spoke of it to his relatives and\nfound the time of death tallied with the time I saw the apparition.\n(I still have the telegram advising me of his death ; this gives the\ndate.) No obituary notice was published at the time, as the family\nwere from the West and had very few friends here. The young\nman, however, was a student at the N.Y. Dental School, 23rd St.,\nup to the time of his death.\nI did not time the length of time the figure appeared behind my\nchair. I was too surprised to notice time, but it must have stayed\nthere a couple of minutes I should judge. I was perfectly conscious\nof this presence, as I explained in my former letter, and turned\nnot knowing what to expect, simply thinking to see some one in\nthe office standing at the back of my chair. My surprise was very\ngreat when I recognized my friend. The whole figure appeared\nfully dressed in a black suit of clothes. I know I stared for some\ntime, and it was all so plain I thought my friend must see it too,\nand I turned to her and asked, \" Did you see any one pass my\nchair just now?\" She looked, and replied \"No,\" and seemed to\nthink my action very queer. I did not explain to her at the time,\nas I feared she would think me imaginative; and at the time we\ndid not know of the illness of this person, neither were we on such\nintimate terms at that time that I felt at liberty to explain matters.\nAs to manner of disappearance I cannot say, as by the time I\nspoke to my friend and turned the second time the figure was no\nlonger visible. When I saw him his hands were resting on the\nback of my chair, and he was looking down at me.\nDirectly following his death, I had a queer dream. It was that\nwe seemed to be walking along the streets of a city I had never\nseen before. The street was lined with trees of goodly size, and the\nhouses were of frame and detached, and with considerable ground\naround them and all setting back from the street. As we walked\n\fMAY, 1908. Cases. 237\nalong this street, he ran a little ahead just as he had often done in\nlife, and hid behind a tree until I came up to it, and then ran out\nto join me again. We walked a little farther, when he left me to\nmeet a gentleman whom I had never seen and whom he spoke to\nand then brought to me. Then we all walked into this house directly\nopposite which we were standing, and which had quite a path through\nthe grounds to reach same, then up a couple of steps into the house.\nAfter entering the house, I woke up.\nThe peculiar part of this dream was the fact that the gentleman\nwhom this friend of mine met was an elderly person dressed in the\ncostume worn perhaps 100 years ago, or thereabouts. He had black\nsilk stockings, low shoes with silver buckles, brown velvet knicker\nbockers, a ruffled shirt and the coat of that period. I particularly\nnoticed that his hair was grey and he had quite a long beard. It\nwas some one whom I had never seen or heard of before. At the\ntime I had a very vivid description of him, and was so impressed\nwith the whole dream that I told it to my father, who at the time\n\u2022questioned me very carefully about the elderly man, after which he\ntold me the description answered that of his father. He had been\ndead many years before, (my own father at that time was about 70\nyears of age), and I had never heard my father speak of him in the\nway of describing him or in fact very little at all, as he was a very\n\u2022quiet and studious man and not given to talk of his family. Neither\nhad we any pictures of him of any description. I know at the time\nray father thought it was so strange that I should have so complete\na description of his father, and he seemed to have no doubt it was\nhis father, though in my dream I did not place this gentleman at\n-all. I only noticed his friendship for my friend, and noted that they\nseemed well acquainted and that he wished me to know this old\ngentleman. My father was an Englishman, and his father spent his\nwhole life in England and I believe died in London, while my friend\n\u2022died in Brooklyn.\nI have also had some trivial dreams come true. For instance,\nafter the death of my friend I was spending a few days at the home\nof his family. On the Sunday morning at breakfast, (it was early\nspring), I said to them : \" I had a strange dream last night. I\ndreamed we were all somewhere in the country\u2014I do not know where,\nbut I remember at the end of the street there was a church on a\nlittle hill. The house we were all in set back a little from the\nroadside. We were in the parlour, in which was a piano at the\nfar end away from the windows, and nearer the entrance to another\n\f238 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1908.\nroom which appeared to be the dining room. The three girls\u2014\n(his sisters) and myself were grouped around the piano and were\nsinging hymns. It seemed to be Sunday afternoon and pouring rain.\nI could see the lightning at intervals as I looked toward the windows.\nOne of the girls, Alice, was playing. We had several hymn books\naround. We would sing all we knew in one and then turn to the\nother book. One of the girls leaned over the piano and took the\nbook from Alice, saying, \"We don't know any more in that one, try\nthis one,\" placing another. I had a feeling that there were other\nhymns which we knew, and leaned over and got the book and con\ntinued looking through it, while they looked through the one which\none of the sisters had placed. Then when I found something we\nknew, I handed it over to Alice to play for us.\nAfter I narrated my dream, they all said, \" Why that's just like\nthe house we hired last summer in Eidgefield, Conn., but now that\nWalter is dead, we may never go there again.\" Well, summer came\nand they hired this same house for the season, and I was invited\nto spend my vacation with them. One Sunday we all sat at the\npiano, singing, and the same incident occurred which I have described\nin my dream, the matter of the books being changed and my leaning\nover for the discarded one and feeling that I knew other hymns in it.\nAt the time, I had a feeling that this had occurred before. One of\nthe sisters, Lillie, immediately spoke up and said: \"Why, Ada, this\nis your dream, you had so long ago, don't you remember ? It is exactly\nthe same, even to the rain. Isn't it strange.\" They all recalled it\nand spoke of it to their mother who was not present at the time.\nThis is only a small affair, but the whole occurrence tallied\nprecisely with my dream and was recollected by all, the same\npeople being present as in my dream, and it was at their home\nin Brooklyn, and before them, that I had told the dream several\nmonths before. Furthermore, I had never been in the town before ;\nhad never had a description of the house and at that time never\nexpected to ever see it.\nI do not know how to account for these affairs, but it seems\nplain to me that dreams do come true.

I have no\nknowledge of anything similar to this dream occurring before my\nfriend's death. I think they will remember the fact of the dream\nthough they may be loth to testify at this time, and so many\nyears have elapsed since it occurred.\nI cannot give an approximate date of my vision in which my\nfriend and grandfather figured, having kept no record at the time\nand never thinking to make use of the experience in any way.\nADA A. GOLLIN.\nMiss Burrows wrote to Dr. Hodgson as follows :\n179 PROSPECT PARK, W.,\nMR. E. HODGSON, BROOKLYN, N.Y., March 29, 1905.\nDear Sir,\u2014In reply to your letter of March 21, it gives me\npleasure ,to corroborate Miss Gollin's statement. I do not remember\nthe exact date of the occurrence she mentions. I remember\ndistinctly however, that we were sitting together working in the\noffice of the Evening Post, where we were both employed. Miss\nGollin's chair was placed at right angles to mine, so that anyone\napproaching her chair would have been plainly visible to me.\nI remember her asking me if I had noticed a man standing back\nof her chair. As she said this she was in the act of looking behind\nher, as if expecting to find someone standing there, or as if she\nwere conscious that someone had just been standing there. I saw\nnothing whatever myself, and am sure that no one in the flesh\ndid approach her chair at that time. I told her I had seen no\none, and thus the incident closed for the moment.\nI did not see her again for several days, when she told me\nthat on arriving home she had found a telegram stating that her\nfiance was dead. Later she learned the hour of his death corre\nsponded exactly with that of the apparition which she had seen\nwhile at work.\nIn closing, it may be of some value to add that Miss Gollin\nis not a person of visionary temperament. She is a thoroughly\npractical and matter-of-fact business woman.\u2014Very respectfully yours,\nELIZABETH L. BURROWS.\n\f240 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Meeting of the Council. 243\nThe final draft Report of the Sub-Committee on Local\nSections was, after slight emendation, adopted, and will be\nfound below on p. 263.\nFive new Members and seven new Associates were elected.\nTheir names and addresses are given above.\nThe monthly accounts for March and April, 1908, were\npresented and taken as read.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nTHE 132nd General Meeting of the Society was held in the\nlarge Hall at 20 Hanover Square, London, W., on Tuesday,\nMay 19th, 1908, at 4.15 p.m. Mrs. Sidgwick gave her Presi\ndential Address, which will be published in the next Part of\nthe Proceedings.\nEXPERIMENTS IN THOUGHT TRANSFERENCE.\nBY CLARISSA MILES.\nTHE experiments here described are a continuation of those\nwhich were previously brought before the Society and\npublished in the Proceedings S.P.R., Part LIV. As before,\nI was the agent and my friend Miss Ramsden the percipient.\nMiss Ramsden on each day sent me a postcard describing\nwhat her impressions\u2014which were generally rather numerous,\n\u2014had been, and I noted each day on a postcard sent to her\nwhat the idea was that I had tried to transmit. On receiving\nher card I noted what facts in my experience had corresponded\nwith her impressions.\nAs in the previous account in Proceedings, (a) indicates my\npostcard written at the time of the experiment ; (b) Miss\nRamsden's postcard recording her impressions at the time ;\n(c) my comments, made after receiving her postcard, as to\npoints in her description that seemed to correspond to what\nhad been happening to me : (d) corroboration of the latter by\nmy friends.\nSome of the experiments failed altogether, and in most of\nthem Miss Ramsden had other impressions besides those that\n\f24-4 Journal o\/ Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 190&.\nwere more or less correct. These unsuccessful cases are\nomitted here ; but as all the experiments are numbered\nconsecutively, the proportion of complete failures is shown.\nIn the record of the more or less successful cases, the\nportions omitted are indicated by asterisks.\nDuring these experiments I was on a tour with Lady\nGuendolen Eamsden in the Ardennes, where Miss liamsden\nhad never been. She only knew my address, so that she\ncould .post the cards. I went to Namur and joined Lady\nGuendolen there on the 13th of July, 1907, and did not\nbegin the experiments till July 21st.\nEXPERIMENT I.\nMiss Ramsden on July 21st sent a sketch of a well which\nshe had been thinking of on the 18th and 19th several\ntimes in connection with me. It will be seen that this has\nsome resemblance to a photograph which I took from our\nhotel window, and part of which is here reproduced, showing a\ntower, which was the most conspicuous object from the hotel\ngarden : when there, we could not look up in any direction\nwithout seeing the tower outlined against the sky ; but the\nweathercock and round ball beneath shown in the photograph\nwould not be visible to us, for the garden being situated\nexactly at the foot of the tower, we were too much under\nneath it.\nEXPERIMENT II.\nThe following is my postcard, written on the first day\nthat I attempted to transfer an idea to Miss Eamsden :\n(a) Hotel d'Harscamp, Namur, July 20th [really 21st].\n[Postmark, Namur, 22. vii. 07. 10.17.]\nWe went to Huy by train and spent the afternoon there, I\nwanted you to see the fine view of citadel. The hill beyond\ncovered with trees, boats in foreground and a fine bridge spanning\nthe Meuse. C. M.\n(6) Miss Eamsden's next postcard, written from Ardverikie,\nKingussie, has the postmark \" Kingussie, 12.45 p.m. Jy. 23. 07 \"\nand has nothing on it except the sketch here reproduced.\nMiss Eamsden adds later :\n\fK\nM\nCO\nX,\n\f\fJUNK, 1908. Experiments in Thought Transference. 245\nMISS BAMSDEN'S SKETCH.\nThis was seen as a hypnagogic illusion just before going to sleep.\nI drew this on Monday after the post had gone (8 a.m.). That\nis why it was not posted until the 23rd. I saw it in colour; the\ndistance was a lovely blue. H. R.\n(d) Lady Guendolen Ramsden, writing to her daughter\nlater of this occasion, sends the following sketch :\n\f246 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1908.\nLady Guendolen adds :\n[On] the day we went to Huy, Clarisse sat under a tree on the\nbank of a garden overlooking the Meuse. She said, \" I'll draw\nthe bridge; M. may get an impression of the arches.\" So you\ndid,\u2014only yours were more like a viaduct. . . . This sketch is\nfrom memory, showing where Clarisse sat to draw. There was a\nlarge tree on whose roots she sat : lots of boats everywhere. . . ,\nThe next two experiments were failures.\nEXPERIMENT V.\n(a) Bruges, July 24th [probably should be 28th, as postmark\nis \"Bruges, 29 Juillet, 07\"].\nWe stopped at Ghent on July 23rd [27th] on our way here.\nHad lunch. Then saw the Cathedral of St. Bavon. The Van Eyck\npicture \"Adoration of the Immaculate Lamb\" interested me much,\ndetails so wonderful. ... C.

R.\n(c) In the \"Adoration of the Immaculate Lamb,\" by Van Eyck,\none of the principal groups in the foreground is composed of\noriental figures, many of whom have turbans on. We had been\nlooking specially at one of these. We were given glasses to inspect\nclosely the wonderful finish and technique of the painting.\nC. M.\nEXPERIMENT VI.\n(a) Sunday, July 24th [28th].\n[Postmark : Bruxelles, date illegible.]1\nWe went to Church in the morning. Then I walked to the\nGrande Place and saw the tournament of the Toison D'Or.\nLadies on horseback with quaint head-dresses, men tilting with long\nlauces, horses caparisoned and shining armour, made a dazzling\npicture of colour. Clowns juggled and tumbled at intervals. The\ngiant and the dwarf gave signals of when the jousts were to begin.\nC. M.\n' Some Bruges letters go via Brussels ; there is the hotel mark [Grand Hotel\nde Commerce, Bruges] on the post-cards.\n\fJUNE, 1908.

A new moon. A nurse with a red cross on her\narm. Prancing horses, wooden ones ; perhaps it is a merry go-\nround. ... It seems scarcely fair to describe Bruges, as I have\nheard so much about it and read about it\u2014I don't know how\nmuch is telepathic. I see a stone bridge with three arches.\nPoverty-stricken houses rising straight up out of the water, clothes\nand rags hanging from the windows. A belfry which dominates\nthe town. Did you go to see the bell? H. R.\n(c) The Grande Place where the Tournament is held is just at\nthe foot of the High Belfry Tower which dominates the town. It\nwas facing me all the afternoon. Numbers of swallows were flying\nabout everywhere. A few of the people in the Procession had\ncrosses on their costumes. The clowns had a sham joust on\nwooden horses, with lances made of thick brown paper like round\npoles. It was very comic, and amused me much. It looked so\nabsurd to watch the ridiculous antics of these clowns, after the\nprancing horses, the shining armour and rich accoutrements of the\nreal tilters with their lances.\nBruges was en fete, decorated everywhere ; flags and banners were\nflying from every window. Bruges is noted for its bridges.\nC. M.\nEXPERIMENT VII.\n(b) Ardverikie, Monday, July 29th.\n[Postmark: Kingussie, 12.30 p.m. Jy. 30. 07.]\n4.45 p.m. I was not thinking of you, when I suddenly began to\nsee Church windows, and realised that you were inside a Church,\nperhaps sketching. The following was a most vivid impression.\n11.80 p.m. You both sketched, my mother sat with her back to\nthe altar and drew the door with its curious old carving. There\nwas a priest in white before the altar, I think \u2022 you drew that.\nOutside the Church were many steps, and people selling postcards,\nand penny toys\u2014windmills with paper sails for children. You\nbought a postcard in case I should see this, and you thought of\nme. The Church is much higher up than I had imagined. It is\nseveral hundred feet above the sea. There is an open space round\nit and, standing on the steps, you get a fine view of the town\n\f248 Journal of Society for Psychicai Research. JUNK, 1908.\nwith its tiled roofs, and the sea beyond. There are fishing boats\nto be seen, and the sun was setting. H. R.\nThese impressions had no connection with what was\nattempted to be transferred on this occasion, but applied\nappropriately to some of the events of the day. Thus :\n(c) On Monday, July 29th, we were in a Cathedral just about\nthe time Miss Eamsden saw the Church windows. We had no\ntime for sketching. But Lady Guendolen said to me : \" What a\nfine head that Priest has, how much I should like to draw him.\"\nThere was also a Priest in white standing in front of the altar.\nThe Church is on a level with the town, not above it. We bought\nmany postcards. A variety of fishing boats were to be seen.\nThey looked most picturesque against the setting sun. Children\nwere swarming everywhere, bringing penny toys, flying paper kites\nand round air balls, blowing trumpets, thoroughly enjoying the\ngay and festive season of the Tournament, which has brought\npeople to Bruges from all parts of the World. C. M.\n(d) Lady Guendolen Ramsden writes :\nWe were in church at the time, 5.30, but not drawing. I did\nsay to Clarisse, \" Look at that priest resting (in a common chair\nlike a visitor). What a fine grey head ! I should like to draw\nhim.\"\nEXPERIMENT VIII.\n(a) August 1st, Hotel de L'Univers.\n[Postmark : Bruxelles, 2 Aout, 07.]\nWe took a drive in the afternoon near the pare and saw the large\nColonne de Congre and the Cathedral. Made several purchases,\ncards with dogs and cart amongst the number. I could not get\ninto any telepathic state to send you impressions. I am just leaving\nfor Montreuil. C.

Quai Bertheldt or some name like that.\n*****\nH. R.\n(c) This is another instance of what happened several times in\nthe earlier experiments ; a name obtained more or less correctly by\nMiss Eamsden. In this case the name \" Quai Berthelot \" was like\nthat of two places we saw,\u2014the Tour de la Reine Berthe and the\nChapelle Sainte-Austreberthe. C. M.\nEXPERIMENT X.\nI next went to Montreuil-sur-Mer in the North of France,\nto join a sketching class organised by Mr. Townsley, Director\nof the London School of Art, tuition to be given by Frank\nBrangwyn, A.E.A.\n(a) Hotel de France, Montreuil-sur-Mer, August 5th.\n[Postmark : Montreuil, 7.8.07.]\nI drew all the morning on the ramparts, trees and cottages.

When I arrived I chose a row of\ncottages with a farmhouse in the distance, surrounded by trees, as\na subject for my sketch. It is very curious that two of the names\nMiss Ramsden thought of, namely, Lafayette and Malesherbes, are\nconnected, not with this village La Madeleine, but with the well-\nknown Church of La Madeleine in Paris. I lived for two winters\nin Paris in La Rue Caumartin close to La Madeleine, so I am well\nacquainted with the whole neighbourhood, and the names of these\nstreets must be subliminally associated in my mind with the name\nLa Madeleine.

We talked especially about the\nChartreuse. I had walked round the ramparts; which command\nan extensive view of the whole neighbourhood, but the Chartreuse\nhad never been pointed out to me as an object of special interest.\nIt is a monastery from which the monks were expelled about five\nyears ago. It has remained unoccupied ever since. Quite recently\nit has been bought by a man who is intending to turn it into a\nSanatorium, and it is now called Sanatorium on picture postcards.\nMr. Baxter's own account of our conversation is as follows :\n(d) December 18th, 1907.\nLa Chartreuse, near Montreuil-sur-Mer, is a not very interesting\nbuilding, being quite modern and containing little more than the\nbare walls. I understood an attendant to say that it had been\nbuilt on the site of a more ancient building : also that the cele\nbrated Chartreuse liqueur had not been made there for a great\nnumber of years. I fancy the same man said there was talk of\nturning the place into a Sanatorium. The foregoing, I think, is all\nI mentioned to you on the 7th August, when speaking of my visit.\nC. H.

R.\n\f256 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNK, 1908.\nEXPERIMENT XVI.\nThis experiment involves a complicated story of supposed\nhauntings near the village of Hoe Benham, and is therefore\ndescribed last.\nLaburnum Villa, where I was staying, is about three\nminutes' walk from the cottage and studio where Mr. Pittman\nand Mr. Waud live. They have been here for about four\nyears. I have been down there three or four times before\nfor painting lessons and have always stayed at Laburnum\nVilla, which belongs to Mr. and Mrs. Henry Lovegrove.\nThis autumn for the first time here, I began to try thought-\ntransference with Miss Kamsden.\nThis is Mr. Pittman's description of what happened on\nNovember 2nd, 1907:\nHoe Benham, Newbury.\nOn November 2nd, 1907, I was painting in the Studio with my\nfriend Eeginald Waud; the model was our servant dressed as a\nwidow, and we were waiting for Miss Miles to join us. At 10\no'clock I knew the milkman had come by the dogs barking in the\ncottage at the top of the garden. So I said, \"I will take the milk\nin,\" and went up to the cottage. After putting the jug in the\npantry and shutting the cottage door, I looked up the road and\nsaw Miss Miles coming down with her easel and paint-box.\nFollowing quite close behind her was a large white pig, with a\nlong snout. I went down to the Studio and said to Waud, \"What\ndo you think Miss Miles is bringing down with her this morning,\ninstead of her Chow ? A large pig ! \" We roared with laughter,\nand he said, \" Call out and tell her not to bring her friend in, and\nto be sure to shut the gate, as we take a great pride in our\ngarden.\" The moment Miss Miles appeared I opened the window\nand shouted out, \" What have you done with your companion ? \"\nShe was very surprised and said, \" My companion, what do you\nmean?\" Then I told her what I had seen following her. She\nimmediately said, \" If a pig were trotting behind me, I must have\nheard it. Besides, there is a very easy way of finding out, for I\npassed the milkman in the lane and he must have seen it, but\nI shall go and look for myself.\" When she came back she said :\n\" There is no trace of a pig anywhere.\" We made enquiries all\nover the village ; no one had seen a stray pig. There is only one\nwhite one in the place, and this one, its owner assured us, could\n\fJUNE, 1908. Experiments in Thought Transference. 257\nnot possibly have got loose without his knowing it. At the present\ntime there is a notice out forbidding owners to allow pigs to stray,\nunder penalty of a fine, as there have been cases of swine fever.\nWe enquired of the milkman next morning. He remembered\npassing Miss Miles, as he usually met her about the same time.\nHe most emphatically said there was no pig to be seen anywhere\non the road.\n(Signed) OSMUND PITTMAN.\nREGINALD WAUD.\nCLARISSA MILES.\nLOUISA THORNE.\nI chose this pig for the subject of experiment with Miss\nRamsden, and wrote on my postcard :\n(a) Laburnum Villa, Saturday, November 2nd.\n[Postmark: Newbury, 6.30 p.m. No. 3. 07.]\nI wished you to see a stuffed pheasant or you may have seen\nthe flying phantom pig.

I can honestly say\nthat I saw no such thing, there was no trace of a pig to be seen\nanywhere. E. CARRELL.\nMrs. Thome wrote :\nI had a talk with the children playing on the road. They had\nseen Miss Miles go by and they told me they had been there all\nthe morning, but they had seen no pig anywhere.\nLOUISA THORNE.\n\f258 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1908.\nOn February 4th, 1908, I returned to Laburnum Villa to\nfinish one or two paintings I began last autumn. I also\nwished to get further evidence of the strange animal forms\nthat are supposed to haunt this lane, as I was told last\nNovember, after the episode of the phantom pig, that so\nmany of the villagers had been witnesses of these remarkable\napparitions under different forms, such as a cat, a dog, or a\nrabbit, or other animals. Mr. Pittman and Mr. Waud had\nnever seen anything weird or out of the ordinary till I came\ndown last autumn and began thought-transference with Miss\nEamsden ; they had only heard quite casually very vague\naccounts of something strange that had been seen years ago,\nto which they had paid but little attention. The villagers\nare very reticient and will not talk much for fear of being\nlaughed at, but the history of the phantom pig overcame all\ndifficulties on that score as regards my enquiries.\nThe villagers all tell the same story to account for these\napparitions. They put them all down to \" Tommy King.\"\nHe was a farmer, who lived over a hundred years ago. He\nhung himself in an outhouse, and his spirit is supposed to\nhaunt the spot, appearing in these strange shapes and making\nuncanny noises. The farm buildings and outhouses were all\ndemolished on the occasion of the sale of the property by\nMr. Dreweatt to Sir Eichard Sutton in 1892 ; only a cottage\nremains, which is still called King's cottage, and a disused\nwell close to the lane, which is called Tommy King's chalk\nwell. In former years they used to dig out chalk from the\nside of the hill. I have looked at the Register of the Parish\nChurch and there are entries of the deaths of two Tommy\nKings, one in 1741, the other in 1753, so it must be one\nof these two.\nAt the corner of the lane stands an old-fashioned inn,\ncalled the Halfway, because it is halfway between London\nand Bristol and sixty miles from each. It is on the main\nroad, and in the olden days all the coaches stopped here\nto change horses. The lane to Hoe Benham branches off\nhere, going up a hill called Pound Hill. King's cottage and\nthe well are situated to the left of the lane. The well is\nclose to the road, but only a hole in the bank indicates the\nspot. At the top of the hill about ten minutes' walk brings\n\fJUNE, 1908. Experiments in Thought Transference. 259\nyou to the Church, then there is a short, sharp decline and\nthe straggling village of Hoe Benham is reached. After\nBenham Hill is mounted a cluster of cottages is seen nestling\non the side of the hill, one of them belonging to Mr.\nPittman and Mr. Waud. Their cottage is about a mile from\nthe Halfway, and it is all along this lane that the apparitions\nhave been seen.\nThe following are accounts which I obtained from some of\nthe villagers. I wrote down what they told me as nearly\nas possible in their own words, and afterwards got their\nsignatures to the accounts.\nHoe Benham.\nIn the beginning of January, 1905, about half-past seven in the\nevening, I was walking up from the Halfway. I suddenly saw an\nanimal that seemed to be like a large, black dog appear quite\nsuddenly out of the hedge and run across the road quite close in\nfront of me ; I thought it was the dog belonging to the curate.\nI was just going to call it to send it home, when it suddenly\nchanged its shape, and turned into a black donkey standing on\nits hind legs. This creature had two glowing eyes, which appeared\nto me to be almost as big as saucers. I looked at it in astonish\nment for a minute or so, when it suddenly vanished. After that\nI hurried home, for the sight of this creature with the large shining\neyes gave me a shock. The evening was a light one for the time\nof year.\n(Signed) WILLIAM THORNE.\nAt Michaelmas, 1897, seven o'clock in the evening, I met a friend,\nJohn Barrett, on Benham Hill, and we stopped to have a chat.\nAt this spot there is a gate on either side of the road. Whilst\nwe were talking a curious looking animal, snowy white, crossed\nthe road quite slowly from one gate to the other close to us.\nJohn Barrett said, \"What was that?\" The animal seemed too\nlarge for a cat, more the size of a terrier with a fluffy coat. I\nwent and stood on the gate and watched it as it trotted half way\nacross the meadow, when it disappeared. The strange whiteness of\nthe creature's coat struck me as being so uncommon.\n(Signed) WILLIAM THORNE, Hoe Benham.\nJOHN BARRETT, Wickham Heath, Newbury.\n\f260 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1908.\nAbout three or four years ago in the autumn about five o'clock,\nsort of between the lights, but I could see everything, I was walking\nto Stock Cross and got to the last handing post. All at once, I\nheard a buzz, like the whizz of leaves, and a rattle on the ground.\nI cast my eyes down, and saw summat in the shape of a calf\nknuckled down. It seemed about 2 ft. 6 in. high and 5 feet long\nwith large glowing eyes. It regularly startled me. My hat waved\nover my head. I kept my eyes on't, but I never saw the goings\non't. (Signed) ALBERT THORNE, Hoe Benham.\nThis is the story as told me by John Barrett and his wife\nPolly. He is 63 years of age. About 50 years ago when\nhe was a lad, he was returning with seven or eight men in\na waggon from Halfway after a day's haymaking. The team\nof horses went quite quietly until they reached Pound Hill,\nwhen suddenly without any warning,\nThe team began a-snortin' and a-blowin' and a tramplin' agen one\nside of the road to another. They were likes to turn round. Carter\njumped down to their heads and began pattin' them, when he said,\n\" Look ! Them horses can see more than we. Look at that white\nthing a-bobbin' up and down over their heads.\" We all looked and\nsaw what he was pointing at. This white thing kept on a-bobbin'\nand a-bobbin', and the horses continued a-snortin' and a-snortin'\nuntil we came to a gate just before the Church, when the white\nthing vanished through the gate, and the team became quite quiet.\nLater on, I became assistant to Mrs. Flower. She kept a baker's\nshop, and I had to lay the leaven for the bread every evening.\nSundays Mrs. Flower always had supper with her mother at\nWickham Heath. For this she had to go up Benham Hill. One\nevening she returned as white as a ghost and lay on the sofa as if\nshe were going to die. She said, \" I be all of a shake and a\ntremble. I did see summat white on the gate at the hill. Never\nshall I go to supper agen with my mother of an evening.\" And\nshe never did. I replied, \" I never seen nothing there on that\nhill ; I have been up and down all hours of the night.\" I\nremember the date, it must have been on a summer's evening\nabout 35 years ago. [Polly Barrett chimed in and said, \" Quite\nright, you were a courtin' and you told me.\"] A few days alter,\nbetween nine and ten in the evening, I was a-comin' down Benham\nHill.

I\nsaw summat like a sheep. I went to poke un with my stick when\nit vanished away.\nAnother time me and my brother George were walking late near\nFerris Cottage. We heard summat that made such a rumpus like\nstones tipped down from a cart. We groped about and walked to\nand agen to and agen, and waited to hear summat more, but could\nnot make out nothing, so we just walked home. My father always\ntold me these apparitions were put down to Tommy King.\n(Signed) JOHN BARRETT, Wickham Heath.\nPOLLY BARRETT.\nThe following were my own experiences at Hoe Benham :\nOn Sunday, February 16th, 1908, I arranged to join Mr. Waud\nand go to the Church with him at Hoe Benham to 3 o'clock\nservice. All the morning I felt in a weird, trance-like state, the\ncondition I get into when I have visions of coming events, changes\nlikely to affect my future. I described these sensations both to\nMr. Pittman and to Mr. Waud. After Church I felt compelled\nto walk towards Tommy King's chalk well, as 1 wished to see the\nroad along which the team of horses came, which were so terrified\nat the white thing bobbing up and down over their heads. We\nthought we would go and have tea with Mr. and Mrs. Le Mesurier,\nwho live at the end of the lane just opposite Halfway Inn. To\nreach them from Hoe Benham we always take a short cut across\nthe fields. I looked over the old inn, and the proprietor showed\nme where the old stables stood, where the bell was always rung to\nget the horses ready for changing teams. I take a great interest\nin all coaching matters and horses, for I have hunted all my life,\nand my father was a splendid whip, also one of the finest heavy\nweights of his day across country. After tea, Mr. Waud and I\nwalked back. On passing Tommy King's well an overpowering\nsense of suffocation seized me, I felt the presence of some awful\nbeing. This evil spirit seemed to follow me up Pound Hill. I\nfelt it longing to do me some bodily injury, there was such deadly\nmalice and hate in the air. I described all this to Mr. Waud.\nWe constantly looked around but could see nothing. These\nsensations continued all the way back, but grew worse as we\nwalked up Benham Hill. After the cottage was passed a shiver\nwent down my back and spine, the same kind of shock I ex\nperience when dowsing and walking over water. Suddenly quite\nclose to us on the road the stillness of the evening was broken\nby an unearthly scream which seemed to end in a moan. As the\nsound seemed so very close to us, we both looked round to see\nif anything was near which would have produced it, but nothing\nwhatever was visible. We both were speechless for a minute,\u2014\nthe effect was so awful. We hardly spoke till we reached Laburnum\n\f262 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNK, 1908.\nVilla, the time being about six o'clock. It was only the next day,\nin comparing notes, that we found this dreadful wailing cry was\nheard on the exact spot where the phantom pig was seen by Mr.\nPittman following me on November 2nd, 1907.\nTwo evenings after, on February 18th, I walked to Tommy King's\nchalk well with Mr Pittman to try if any more strange phenomena\ncould be seen. It was a brilliant moonlight night. No evil beings\nwere there to disturb the stillness of this evening, all was calm\nand peaceful. I tried automatic writing, and two sentences were\nwritten twice over; they came with such lightning speed, no human\nhand could have written that pace alone. The words were, \" I\nam in hell, pray for me, I am in hell, pray for me \" ; nothing\nmore. On walking back we looked around and across the lane a\nwhite band of light appeared ;\u2014the same sparkling effect I have\nsometimes seen at sea, from the deck of a yacht on a dark night,\nshimmering on the ocean. It was of a quite different quality from\nthe moonlight. This luminous effect undulated up and down, back\nwards and forwards, and seemed to come towards us, till it\nappeared to be only five yards away ; it was about a foot from\nthe ground ; it then receded and disappeared. We both saw it ;\nmost strange and mysterious it appeared in the brilliant moonlight.\nAnother evening a little later I walked down with Mr. Pittman\nbut nothing of special interest occurred. But the pencil wrote\nautomatically, \" I am happier.\"\nOn Benham Hill where so many strange apparitions have been\nseen, one evening when it was half daylight, half dark, I distinctly\nsaw a white shadowy form which appeared like drapery standing\nagainst the gate. No one else saw this.\nOn Thursday, February 27th, my last evening at Hoe Benham,\nI dined at the cottage, and Mr. Pittman and Mr. Waud walked\nback with me. We were laughing and talking. Suddenly our\nconversation was interrupted by this unearthly moaning cry, which\ncame wailing across the stillness of the evening. This doleful\nsound seemed to come over our heads from the roof of the Chapel\nwhich is exactly opposite Laburnum Villa. We all heard it. It\nwas a repetition of the groan Mr. Waud and I heard the other\nevening preceded by that awful scream.\n(Signed) CLARISSA MILES.\nREGINALD WAUD.\nOSMUND PITTMAN.\nMr. Waud adds :\nOn Monday, February 24th, whilst Pittman and I were taking\ntea in the cottage, two distinct taps were heard on the door just\nbehind us.

The following\nis a brief abstract of the paper :\nThe theory that many of the so-called \" Physical Phenomena\nof Spiritualism \" may be put down to hallucinations or illusions\ninduced in the sitters by the medium has from time to time\nbeen propounded by different writers. In favour of it we\n\fJULY, 1908. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 267\nmay urge the a priori improbability of the supposed pheno\nmena, the repeated exposures of fraud, the growing revelations\nof the possibilities of suggestion, and the strong evidence that\nexists for the occasional occurrence of collective hallucinations.\nThe writer discusses how far this theory can account for those\nphysical phenomena which are most difficult to explain. He\nby no means denies the possibility of explaining many of the\nmanifestations by fraud, but his present discussion is confined\nto the validity of the explanation by hallucination or illusion,\ni.e., he considers whether the phenomena are subjective or objec\ntive, not whether they are fraudulent or genuine.\nHe also excludes from his review the whole domain of\nEastern and Far Eastern Magic. Although some striking cases\nhave recently been reported 1 which seem to point to something\nlike collective hypnotisation as their explanation, these cases\nare far too few to be used as material for speculation. It is\npossible that certain modes of deception may have been\ndeveloped in the East and remained unknown in the West ;\nbut on the only occasion when the well-known story of the\nphotographing of Indian conjurors without their tricks being\nreproduced on the photographic plate assumed a form capable\nof being investigated, it turned out to be a hoax.2\nA specially instructive case for discussion is that of the\n\" spirit-hands \" so frequently reported to have been seen at the\nsittings with D. D. Home. Two circumstances strongly suggest\nthat these \" hands \" were hallucinatory : (1) That they were\noften not equally visible to all the persons present; e.g. one\nperson would see a more or less nebulous-looking hand, and\nanother a luminous cloud, while a third would see nothing.\n(2) That when tightly grasped by the hand of one of the sitters,\nthe spirit-hand would- sometimes appear slowly to melt away.\nOn the other hand, the following circumstances\u2014especially\nthe second one\u2014tend to sbow that Home's spirit-hands, whether\nfraudulent or genuine, were objective:\n(1) They were seen by a large number of persons at different\ntimes and often by several simultaneously.\n1 See Journal S.P.R, Vol. XL, pp. 299-308 (Nov., 1904) and Vol. XII.,\np. 30 (Feb., 1905).\n2 See Journal S.P.R. Vol. V., pp. 84-6 (June, 1891).\n\f268 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 190S.\n(2) They are constantly described as performing actions with\na permanent result ; e.g. moving objects from one place to\nanother. And it is specially noteworthy that when this\noccurred, some of the sitters again would not see the hand,\nbut only the object moving, while others would see a hand\nmoving it. Some instances of this were given.\nIn these cases, then, we have to account for the movement of\nthe object, as well as for the appearance of the hand.\nThe same difficulty sometimes meets us in the case of full-form\nphantasms. An instance was given where an appearance was\nseen by one person only, after a suggestion, more or less direct,\nwas made by the medium to that person. In another case the\napparition of Home's wife was seen by three persons at once,\nbut the apparition left no traces behind to prove its objective\ncharacter.\nIn another case, however, recorded by Mr. W. Stainton Moses,\nand corroborated later by Lady Crookes, at a sitting with\nHome, a materialised form was seen which carried an accordion\nacross the room towards Lady Crookes, and then vanished.\nThe fact of its moving the accordion seems good evidence\nthat the apparition, whether genuine or fraudulent, was\nobjective.\nSome of Home's \" fire-tests \" with red-hot coals and hot\nlamp chimneys are still more difficult to explain by hallucina\ntion, e.g. when one man gets a blister on his finger after\ntouching a lamp chimney which has just been found cool to\nthe touch by two other persons ; when a red-hot coal which\nhas just been handled with impunity by Home and a lady sets\nfire to a piece of paper; or when a match ignites on touching\na lamp chimney which has been left for a few minutes in a\nglowing fire, after which Home put it in his mouth and applied\nhis tongue to it.\nIn spite of all this evidence to the objective character of\nmany of the most remarkable physical phenomena, the writer\ndoes not deny that some incidents connected with spiritistic\nseances may be explained by hallucination ; namely, those\nexperienced by only one sitter at a time, when the explanation\nby fraud presents serious difficulties, and when there is no\nother positive evidence for the actual occurrence of the\n\fJULY, 1908. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 269\nphenomenon. In such cases we are logically bound to conclude,\nat least provisionally, that the sitter was subject to an illusion\nof the senses.\nThe writer believed that this was the explanation of what\nhe had often witnessed at the sittings of the late Kussian\nmedium Sambor ; l when, the medium's hands being held,\nchairs would be threaded on his arm without, as far as his\nneighbours could ascertain, his hands having been released\nfor a moment. Probably one of his neighbours was mistaken\nin thinking that he had not let go of the hand, from which\nit follows that there must have been a moment during which\nhe had a hallucinatory impression of a hand in his.\nThe writer desired to make it clear that, though he rejected\nhallucination as an adequate explanation of most of the cases\nhe had discussed, it by no means followed that he was\nconvinced of their genuineness. Although impressed with\nmuch of the Home evidence, he thought it presented serious\ndrawbacks in the remoteness of the incidents and the impos\nsibility of repeating them ; the almost unlimited possibilities\nof conjuring and the numberless exposures of other mediums;\nthe fact that many, and probably most, of the sitters seem to\nhave been quite incompetent investigators, and that their\nevidence is consequently worthless ; the frequent looseness of\nconditions at the sittings; and finally that even Home's career\nwas not free from suspicious incidents. All these circumstances\nmilitate against the acceptance of his phenomena as genuine.\nFurther it may be urged that no worthy successor of his has\nyet appeared, while we are constantly learning of new sources\nof error and realising more and more the general unreliability\nin these matters of almost all persons who are not specially\ntrained and qualified experts. Still, after framing on some such\nlines as these a provisional negative conclusion, let us all hope\nthat a day may come when a second Home will triumphantly\nreverse it.\nTHE HON. EVERARD FEILDING said that he found it difficult to\ndraw any satisfactory positive conclusions from Count Solovovo's\npaper. At its commencement he had supposed that the writer\n1 See Annales den Sciences Psychiques for 1899, 1900, 1902 and 1904, passim ;\nand Proceedings S.P.R., Part LV., pp. 396-7.\n\f270 Journal for Society of Psychical Research. JULY, 1908.\nwould try to show either that the hypothesis of collective\nhallucination was sufficient to explain the phenomena, or that\nfraud must be concluded throughout, or finally that some of the\nphenomena were genuine. But it turned out that the writer did\nnot commit himself to any of these conclusions, but only to\nthe view that hallucination was an insufficient explanation. For\nhis part Mr. Feilding was disposed to agree with this opinion.\nIt did not seem to him possible that either fraud alone or\nhallucination alone could account for all the phenomena reported\nby Lord Adare in connection with Home. We should have to\nassume at least a combination of a great deal of fraud with a\ngreat deal of hallucination to explain them all away.\nHe thought it very doubtful whether collective visual hallu\ncinations could be induced in persons of anything approaching\na normal constitution in a waking state. Even in hypnotised\nsubjects, his own experience was that the sense of sight was\nthe last of the senses to be affected by suggestion. It is\ncommon to meet with subjects in whom hallucinations could\nbe readily produced in all other senses, but not in that of sight.\nHe had, however, been experimenting lately with an unusually\ninteresting and susceptible subject in whose case no sugges\ntion failed. Thus, in imitation of an experiment of Professor\nBarrett's, he had made the subject believe that he saw him\n(Mr. Feilding) floating round the room in the air when he\nwas really walking round on the floor, and it was noteworthy\nthat the subject on waking still believed (as the result of\npost-hypnotic suggestion) that he had witnessed the levita-\ntion, and was quite unaware that he had been hypnotised.\nHe made the same subject believe that he had witnessed\nan impossible conjuring trick, performed by an amateur con\njuror who was actually present. The conjuror put a watch on\na chair under a handkerchief, and then stood at a distance\nwhile the subject verified this fact. He then stated that when\nhe counted five, the watch would be found in a casket on\nthe other side of the room. The conjuror counted up to four,\nwhen Mr. Feilding quickly entranced the subject, and the\nwatch was put in the casket. Then the conjuror began\ncounting again, and counted up to five, the . subject being\nawakened at four. He had by suggestion been made oblivious\n\fJULY, 1908. Private Meeting \/or Members and Associates. 271\nof all that had happened after the first 4 was uttered until\nthe 5 was uttered, and believed that this had followed\nimmediately after the first 4. Nor, again, did he know\nthat he had been hypnotised, and was consequently greatly\nimpressed by the conjuror's skill.\nThese experiments showed that practically any deceptions\ncould be produced in a sufficiently suggestible person, while it\nwas possible to produce them without the person knowing, or\nat least remembering, that he had been hypnotised at all.\nIt did not, however, follow that people in general were\nliable to such delusions, nor that they could be produced\nwithout hypnosis, though there was a certain amount, of evi\ndence that in the East large crowds, or at all events, a large\nproportion of them, could be thus hallucinated without hypno-\ntisation. Mr. Feilding thought it possible that here and there\none of the persons at a seance might be hallucinated, or perhaps\nas many as two at a time; but he doubted the possibility of\nproducing a collective hallucination in several persons at once,\nand thought the theory quite inapplicable to the great mass of\nHome's phenomena.\nMR. J. G. PIDDINGTON, though disclaiming a belief in the\nhallucination theory, observed that we must take into account\nthe fact that probably only a very small proportion of Home's\nphenomena had been recorded, and those, doubtless, were only\nthe successful ones, the others not being considered interesting\nor worth noting. It was therefore possible to argue that in\nthe course of all the sittings many suggestions had probably\nbeen made by him which had failed , to take effect, and that\nonly those successfully imposed on specially suggestible sitters\nhad got recorded. In other words, a gradual elimination of\nunsuggestible and a gradual selection of suggestible sitters was\nalways going on ; and so it was not necessary to suppose such\na wholesale power of inducing hallucinations as Mr. Feilding\nseemed to think was required.\nDR. H. D. R. KINGSTON gave an account of a conjuring trick\nreported to him by an engineer on board a New Zealand\nliner, who appeared to him and to others to be a good witness.\nThis gentleman told him that on one occasion while his ship\nwas in harbour a Hindoo conjuror came on board and gave a\n\f272 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1908.\nperformance on the deck to six or seven of the officers. The\nnarrator happening to come up from below while this was being\ndone, watched the conjuror from behind, being himself unseen.\nHe saw the conjuror produce an egg, and heard him make chirping\nsounds suggestive of a chicken, coming out of it, and afterwards\nwave his arms and point in the air to suggest that a full-\ngrown bird was flying about, and finally that it had flown\naway. While the narrator saw nothing but the egg and the\ngestures of the conjuror, the other officers assured him after\nwards that they had seen a chicken and a full-grown bird\nwhich flew away.\nMR. F. PODMORE remarked in regard to Home's phenomena\nthat Home, not being dependent on payment for his sittings,\nwas in a position to select his sitters, and did so with\ngreat care. It was considered a great favour to be admitted,\nand he exercised freely his privilege of rejection. It was\ntherefore probable that he only allowed persons to frequent\nthe sittings after he had found by experience that they were\nmore or less suggestible. It appeared from the published records\nthat not more than about twenty or, at the outside, thirty\npersons witnessed his phenomena, and these were probably\nselected from a large number of possible sitters. The mere act\nof sitting with him must have constituted a training in sug\ngestibility, like that undergone by practised hypnotic subjects.\nAn interesting instance of the effect of training on suggesti\nbility was shown in some recent experiments on the \" Reichen-\nbach \" phenomena reported from the new psycho-physical\nlaboratory at Amsterdam. The experiments were made to test\nthe supposition that when a steel bar was magnetised luminous\neffects were produced, which were visible to certain persons.\nOut of 70 or 80 persons, about 50 saw flashes of light frequently\nin the course of the experiments, but these impressions occurred\nat random, and had no constant relation to the moments when\nthe steel bar was magnetised. After a few weeks, however,\nsome six or seven out of the persons experimented with\nseemed to develop the faculty of seeing the flashes at the\nmoment of magnetisation. This was probably to be attributed\nto an extra sensitivity developed by training, which enabled them\nto perceive slight indications of the working of the apparatus.\n\fJDLY, 1908. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 273\nDR. M. H. MEHKJI related some experiences of his own\nwith a yogi from the Himalayas, whose performances used to\nbe witnessed by many Englishmen of high standing in\nIndia. This yogi could make a large audience, including\nmany educated Europeans, believe that they saw almost\nanything he chose\u2014e.g. a live monkey hopping about the room,\nor a snake wriggling about among them. The speaker had\narranged with a friend of his to take photographs to test\nwhether the object seen was real or hallucinatory, and in no case\nhad the object been reproduced in the photograph. He himself\nhad several times shared in these collective hallucinations.\nSIR LAWRENCE JONES asked whether it could be supposed\npossible that a medium while entranced could give suggestions\nto sitters. Thus he was once at a sitting where the medium\n\u2014a lady well known to him\u2014was in a deep trance, lying on\na sofa at one side of the room. Raps came on a table near\nthe sitters, and at some distance from the medium, which\ninformed them that she was lying with her head in a very\nuncomfortable position, and that a pillow should be put under\nher head to support it. They then looked at her, and saw\nthat she did seem to be requiring some such support. Could\nit reasonably be supposed that the entranced medium pro\nduced on the sitters the impression of hearing raps which\ngave this appropriate information ?\nMR. FEILDING replied that if mediums could produce such\nimpressions, he saw no reason why the trance condition should\ninterfere with the power.\nMR. W. W. BAGGALLY, referring to Count Solovovo's descrip\ntion of Sambor's performance of apparently getting chairs\nthreaded on his arm while his hands were being held by the\npersons sitting on each side of him, gave a practical demon\nstration of a method by which a similar trick could be per\nformed and had actually been performed by a well-known\nmedium in his presence. In this case the medium rapidly but\nquietly turns his chair, immediately after the room has been\ndarkened, so that its back is at his side. He then passes his\narm through the back and allows the sitters to hold his hands.\nAfter some time he suggests that the chair is being pulled\naway from under him. He stands up and the sitters find the\n\f274 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1908.\nchair hanging on his arm ; or\u2014better still\u2014as he stands up, he\nmay contrive to slip the chair on to the arm of the person\nwho is holding his hand on that side, and this person can\ntruthfully assert that he has not let go the medium's hand\nfor a moment since he began to hold it.\nMr. Baggally showed further how the apparent illusion,\ndescribed by a spiritualistic lady to Count Solovovo, of two\nchairs hanging on a sitter's arm, and their backs then seeming\nto part in two, so that they fall to the floor,1 could have been\nproduced. In this case, after the room has been darkened, the\nmedium does not pass his arm through the back of a chair,\nbut after giving his hands to his neighbouring sitters, pushes\none sitter's chair with his foot, so as to give the impression\nthat the chair is being pulled away. The sitter then stands up\nand the medium and his other neighbour do the same. Then\nthe medium by means of his foot arranges two chairs in front\nof him back to back and distant about five inches from each\nother. (The sound of the moving about of chairs which the\nlady described to Count Solovovo was probably due to this\narrangement.) The medium when moving aside his hand\ntogether with that of the sitter (as described by the lady)\npasses the latter's arm side by side with his own through\nthe backs of both chairs, at such a slope that only the back\nof the nearer one is felt, which suggests that one chair\nonly is hanging on the sitter's arm. The sitter is \" advised\nto bring the lower part of his arm close to the upper\npart \" and then feels the back of the second chair resting on\nhis arm also. Meanwhile he does not suspect that the chairs\nare also hanging on the medium's arm. The sitter \" having\nsqueezed both chairs,\" the medium throws his body backwards\nand straightens his arm, thus bringing his elbow to a higher\nlevel than the sitter's. This causes the chairs to rise from the\nsitter's arm and slide down the medium's arm on to the floor.\nThe sudden cessation of contact with the chairs gives the sitter\nthe \" feeling as if their backs had parted in two.\" Light chairs\nwith straight backs are best for this trick.\nJSee Proceedings S.P.R., Part LV., pp. 396-7, foot-note.\n\fJULY, 1908. Reviews. 275\nREVIEWS.\nOn the Threshold of a New World of Thought. By W. F. BARRETT,\nF.R.S. London 1908. Pp. xv. 127. 2s. 6d.\nEARLY in our Society's history, Professor Henry Sidgwick, our first\nPresident, wrote, \"It is a scandal the dispute as to the reality of\nthe marvellous phenomena of spiritualism should still be going on :\nphenomena of which it is quite impossible to exaggerate the\nscientific importance if only a tenth part of what has been alleged\nby generally credible witnesses could be shown to be true.\"\nThis dictum, which after the lapse of five and twenty years is\nunfortunately almost as applicable as when it was uttered, Professor\nBarrett takes as a text for the work which now we notice. For\nreasons given in the preface, though in substance it was prepared\nand formed the subject matter of a lecture delivered at the invitation\nof the London Spiritualistic Alliance some fourteen years ago, its\npublication has been delayed until to-day ; but all investigators of\nthe subject will welcome its appearance as opportune.\nOf course most of the evidence which it succinctly recites will be\nfamiliar to those of our members who have long been associated\nwith us and have studied our publications, but readers will be\npleased to find that the study has been brought up to date by\nthe incorporation of some recent and well-authenticated cases. The\nsummary which is here given of the state of the prolonged and even\nperennial argument by such a judicious and experienced investigator\nas the author cannot fail to be of immense value to those (and their\nnumber seems to be increasing every year) who are attracted to\nthe subject. Especially must this be so in the case of those who\nare comparatively unacquainted with the past history of the inquiry,\nand who are scarcely able to trace its course in the many volumes\nof our Proceedings.\nThe author, moreover, does not confine himself to a mere re\ncapitulation of the evidence for the actual occurrence of the physical\nphenomena in question. He fairly meets the criticisms of two\nclasses of assailants who object to the investigation altogether. The\nobjection on religious grounds is one which scarcely calls for\nconsideration in these pages, inasmuch as the very existence of our\nSociety is sufficient evidence that its supporters have formed something\nlike a collective judgment on that aspect of the question. More\nfrequently, perhaps, we meet with the \" Cui bono \" objection, the\ncontention that after so many years of experiment nothing of value\n\f276 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1908.\nhas been discovered through any physical manifestation, nothing\ntrustworthy through any alleged communication. Professor Barrett's\nreply to this criticism is conclusive. I can well imagine a scoffer\nstanding by when Franklin's kite drew an electric current from the\n\u2022clouds and asking, \"And now you have done it, what the better is\nany one 1 \" But we have not exhausted the results of that experiment\nyet.\nProfessor Barrett boldly adopts the spiritualistic explanation of the\nphenomena at any rate as a provisional hypothesis ; but no one will\nbe more ready than he to admit that a general adoption of this view\nis by no means to be expected at present ; and no one would be less\n\u2022desirous that we should be in a hurry to pronounce on so great a\nsubject. Certainly, however, its adoption by some of the acutest\nthinkers and most careful investigators of this generation entitles it\nto respectful consideration. De Morgan, who is often quoted in the\nwork, wrote more than forty years ago as follows : \" I am perfectly\nconvinced that I have both seen and heard in a manner which should\nmake unbelief impossible, things called spiritual which cannot be\ntaken by any rational being to be capable of explanation by imposture,\ncoincidence or mistake. So far I feel the ground firm under me.\nBut when it comes to what is the cause of these phenomena, I find\nI cannot adopt any explanation which has yet been suggested. . . .\nBut thinking it very likely that the universe may contain a few\nagencies\u2014say half-a-million\u2014about which no man knows anything,\nI cannot but suspect that a small proportion of these agencies\u2014say\nfive thousand\u2014may be severally competent to the production of all\nthe phenomena, or may be quite up to the task among them. The\nphysical explanations which I have seen are easy, but miserably\ninsufficient: the spiritual hypothesis is sufficient but ponderously\ndifficult. Time and thought will decide, the second asking the first\nfor more results of trial.\"\nNotwithstanding the history of these forty years in the wilderness,\nit is probable that many of our readers will even now be scarcely\nwilling to go further than this ; but however views may differ, I\nam sure that the invitation contained in the concluding words of\nthe quotation is one which every earnest inquirer will endorse,\nand no one more eagerly than the writer of the work under notice.\nH.

No. 3. 1907.\nIn the last quarterly Eeport of the Psycho-physical Laboratory in\nAmsterdam there is an account by Floris Jansen of some interesting\nexperiments in thought-transference. Herr F. M. Geels and Herr\nF. E. Visser acted alternately as agent and percipient : the experiments\nwere conducted and the results recorded by Herr Jansen. The\nresults were such as to convince all the persons concerned,\u2014who\ncame to the trials without any experience in the subject, and as they\nclaim, with open minds,\u2014of the existence of \"a mental rapport\"\nbetween the two parties to the experiment.\nThe method of experimenting was as follows : Twenty-five cards\nwere prepared, about eight inches square, having words or figures\nwritten or printed on them. The percipient sat at a small table.\nThe agent stood behind him, and Herr Jansen, after they had taken\ntheir places, handed to the agent one of the cards, drawn from the\npack. The agent looked at the card attentively for a short time,\nand then generally placed it behind him. Each experiment lasted\nfive minutes. The percipient drew or noted down on paper any\nideas that came to him. No word was allowed to pass between\npercipient and agent.\nIn the first series there were thirty-five trials, of which fifteen were\ncomplete failures : in nine cases there was some correspondence\nbetween the percipient's impression and the subject set, but not\nenough to justify the counting of the results as successes : the\nremaining eleven cases Herr Jansen thinks may be regarded as more\nor less successful.\nOne of the successful experiments, which Herr Jansen records at\nlength, was as follows :\n\"On the 8th June of this year (1907), a very successful evening,\non which not a single experiment failed, I gave Herr Geels, who\nwas acting as agent, a card with the word ape written on it. It\nshould be noted that this was the first occasion on which a card with\nthe picture or the name of an animal or of any object had been\ngiven ; we had hitherto confined ourselves exclusively to mathematical\nfigures and numbers, so that there could not be the slightest expecta\ntion of the nature of the thing to be guessed. The result was as\nfollows : After a short interval of darkness the percipient, Herr Visser,\nsaw the figure of a large crab on the opposite wall : he said that\nthe animal was moving its feet. After some time the picture\ndisappeared, and there came in its place the picture of an ant : ' it\n\f278 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1908.\nis brown,' he said, 'and has long hairs, just like an ant.' (It is\nto be noted that generally speaking one would picture to oneself an\nant as without hairs.) Once more the picture changed, and Herr\nVisser now fancied that he was looking at the ant through a\nmicroscope, for it seemed enormous. At this moment time was up,\nand the experiment ended. The result was interesting, if only\nbecause when a mathematical figure or cypher might have been\nexpected, the picture of an animal appeared. When I asked\nHerr Visser to draw what he had seen, I got the accompanying\nfigure, which in fact doesn't bear much resemblance to an ant.\nWe see how little value must be attached to the name which the\npercipient gives to the picture presented to his mental vision. We\nwere already disposed to count this experiment a success, on the\nground that during the three months over which the experiments had\nhitherto extended, neither the name nor the picture of an animal had\nbeen set, or had occurred to the percipient, so that it seemed very\nimprobable that the coincidence could be due to chance. But we\nwere confirmed in our view, when we learnt from Herr Geels, the\nagent, that embarrassed at the sight of the word ' ape,' and not\nknowing how to ' translate ' it, since he had been accustomed to\ndeal only with mathematical figures, which he could easily represent\nto himself, he resolved to picture to himself the big ape at the\nZoological Gardens, as he had seen it standing upright against\nthe bars of the cage. Now, if we suppose that the drawing here\nreproduced was made by a child,1 and if we remember that the\npercipient fancied that he saw his ant through a microscope and\ncovered with long hairs, we must, I think, admit that there was\na strong resemblance between the images present to the mind of\nagent and percipient respectively.\"\nDuring the earlier part of the experiment the agent kept his\nhands on the back of the chair on which the percipient was seated.\nLater, he put his hands on the percipient's shoulders, and it was at\nthis point that Herr Visser fancied he saw the ant through a microscope.\nIt is difficult, as Herr Jansen says, to conceive how the idea of a\nlarge hairy animal could have been conveyed by unconscious muscular\nmovements. Nor is it easy to see how any information could have\nbeen gained by the ears ; since the Dutch words for crab (kreeft)\nand ant (mier) bear no resemblance to ape (Aap).\n1 In the earlier part of his paper Herr Jansen had argued that the percipient\nin his endeavour to seize and interpret the image flashed on his mint! from the\nagent is in the position of a small child trying to draw or describe some new\nobject.\n\fJULY, 1908. Reviews. 279\nIn the three other experiments made on the same evening the\nresults were almost equally suggestive of imperfect seeing on the part\nof the percipient. In the second trial, the card chosen was entirely\ncovered with a dark-blue paper, which in a dim light showed\nsimply as a dark colour. The percipient said that there didn't seem\nto be much white there\u2014it was all dark\u2014then he saw a large black\ncircle, and a much smaller, thinner circle\u2014then a steamboat\u2014then\nhe saw again the brown colour\u2014he could not make out any figure\u2014\nthen it became somewhat lighter. At this point the time expired,\nand the experiment terminated.\nIn the third trial the design on the card consisted of twelve circles\nin three or four rows. The percipient\u2014in this instance Herr Geels\u2014\nsaid, \"It is all circles crossing each other ('durcheinander,' 'door\n\u2022elkaar'), something like a melon.\"\nIn the fourth trial the design was a line twisted round on itself in\nall directions, which gave the impression of a picture of a very\ncomplicated knot. Herr Visser, the percipient, saw a figure like a\n\u2022capital V twining about in every direction, and constantly changing\nits place. In fact, as it appeared, the agent, when he looked at the\nfigure, had specially concentrated his attention on the junctions of\nthe lines, which in several places presented the form of a capital V.\nIt is noteworthy that in none of these four trials did the percipient\nsee anything that was absolutely irrelevant or incorrect, except\nperhaps the steamboat in experiment No. 2. But this was probably\nsuggested by the dark colour which preceded it. In all four cases\nthe description given by the percipient is, as Herr Jansen points out,\njust such as might have been given by a person who saw the actual\npicture under unfavourable conditions.\nIt is to be hoped that Herr Jansen will shortly publish a full\naccount of the experiments, and that he will continue them until he\nhas obtained even more decisive results.\nIn two points, however, it may be suggested, his method of\nexperimenting is open to some objections. It does not appear that the\ncard chosen for the experiment was taken at random from the pack\nheld in his hands. If the card was selected, instead of being drawn\nat random, it is possible to explain the results as due to the\noperation of chance-association of ideas common to the minds of all\nthe experimenters. At least, the results will always be open to that\n\u2022objection.\nIn the second place, it is extremely desirable that all contact\nwhatever between agent and percipient should be eliminated.

Coincident dream.\nTHIS is a case in which the dreamer has for some time been\nmuch interested in psychic phenomena, and kept pencil and\npaper ready to hand in order to record any unusual phenomenon.\nAs to whether the incident was in any way connected with the\ndream there will be a difference of opinion, but the resemblance\nis striking enough to make it worth recording.\nith January, 1908.\nDear Sir,\u2014I enclose an account of dream which occurred to my\nyoungest sister in this house, apparently just before waking at 2 a.m.,\n1st January, 1908.\nBeing of a psychopathic nature, she is accustomed to keep paper\nand pencil by her bedside for automatic writing, eyelid visions,\ndreams, etc., or clairaudient experiences, so was able to note it at\nonce.\nMy sister read it aloud to us at breakfast, apologising for its\nunappetising details. We all felt sure it had some meaning,\nbecause as a family we have had several curious experiences of the\nsort which have been verified by facts later. I remarked that it might\nhave reference to a hospital in London, with street accidents, and\npatients on beds, and underground corridors. This solution occurred\nto me, I suppose, because I am contemplating work of the sort before\nvery long in town.\nI can answer for the bcma fides of the dream, and hope it may be\nof interest to you, as the explosion in Rome was the first piece of\nnews which came to my ears from the outside world during the\nmorning.\u2014Yours faithfully, F. S. W.\nIf you should ever report the case, kindly record only initials of\npersons and place.\nith January, 1908.\nDear Sir,\u2014I wish to add my testimony to the accompanying\naccount, written by my sister, of a dream which occurred to my\nyoungest sister on the early morning of January 1st, 1908.\nFeeling much impressed with her account, I felt convinced that\nsomething of a similar nature would be reported in the paper.\nSo, immediately on receiving our daily Standard, I opened the\n\fOCT., 1908. Cases. 283\npaper, and saw a vivid report of the accident which occurred in\nRome. I folded back the page, and handing the paper to my sister,\nsaid, \" Here is your dream, and this account tallies with yours.\nHoping this may be of interest to your Society.\u2014I am, faithfully\nyours, .. E. W.\nThe following is the account of the dream :\n2 a.m., 1st January, 1908.\nI have just waked from a confused dream of which I do not\nremember the whole, but I feel I must write it down as I am so\nwide awake.\nIn the dream I seemed to be back in the old house, but it was\ndifferent; there were underground passages and rooms, but not the\nsame ; the kitchen, too, had a window which looked on a side street,\nand this window had only half a shutter and no blind.\nI have a dim memory of seeing and speaking to boys, who for some\nreason I was scolding, but I felt that my warnings made no impression.\nThen I seemed to be outside the house with grown-up people who\nwere talking and being disobedient and grumbling over something, I\ndon't know what. I remember smelling something horrible, and\nseeing that some one had stepped into a hot pie, then the scene\nchanged into a room, the floor of which was covered in blood. Mother\n(who is dead) went into the kitchen, looked out at the window, as\nthere was a great roar in the street, and the sound of vehicles in the\nstreet above.\nF came in and said, \"Isn't it a pity? Mother was getting\non so well, and now she can't any more; even the other noise did\nnot disturb her, for she used to say they are. Tarantelle and\nGargantua, Lohengrin's horses galloping together with a rhythm as\nmuch as to say, Never mind, never mind, you'll get to Walhalla,\nyou'll get to Walhalla.\" I went up and brought in two children, of\nwhom the cook had been complaining, and set them in two chairs\nfound they were two disobedient pupils.\nI went into a room, and saw a little blood on my dress, and said\nso. Mother said, \"Do you mind that, there is blood here everywhere,\"\nand as I looked, it was everywhere.\nI then returned to the kitchen, and said to the two children who\nwere complaining, \" You mind that, why (looking through the window)\noutside on a mattress are human beings writhing in agony from an\naccident, and there is blood everywhere.\"\nI then took my share in staunching it. Even the sky was blood-red,\nI could'nt get the writhing human forms out of my mind. W.\n\f284 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1908.\nL. 1172. Coincident dream.\nTHE first account of this case was sent by the percipient,\nMrs. Williams, to Mr. G. Lowes Dickinson, who forwarded\nit to us in a letter bearing the postmark, June 25th, 1908.\nIt was as follows :\nVilla Bethell, Garmisch, Bavaria.\nYou will be interested in a rather curious coincidence (?) which\noccurred yesterday.\nArthur and I had been travelling nearly all day and were tired\nat night and slept soundly. The moment I woke I found myself\nimpressed with a singularly vivid dream\u2014not detailed, but very\ndistinct. I thought I had torn my finger nail across, and was so\ncertain of it that I examined it critically and was almost surprised\nto find it as usual. While I was looking at it Arthur said\u2014\"I\ntore my nail last night: got out of bed to see if I could shut out\nthe coming light, and damaged my nail on the shutter : it is so\npainful.\"\nI said\u2014\" Did you speak, or say a word about it ? \" He said\n\"No, I was most anxious to make no noise, as you were so tired\n(one reason why I was shutting out the light) and I know I did\nnot wake you.\"\nI had no recollection of anything of any kind, but fancied he\nmight have let slip a suggestive word or two, which penetrated my\nconsciousness without waking me, but he declares he did not.\nIn reply to a request for further details and confirmatory\nevidence Mrs. Williams wrote to us :\nJuly 13th, 1908.\nLast month my husband and I were travelling in Bavaria, and I\nwas very tired on reaching Garmisch, in the Highlands.\nI fell asleep directly we got into bed, and was conscious of\nnothing until about 7 in the morning, when I found myself earnestly\nexamining my finger nail under the conviction that I had hurt it.\nI was so sure of this that I was intensely surprised that I could\nsee no mark of injury.\nI said to my husband \"I have had such an extraordinary im\npression that I had torn my finger nail, but nothing is wrong with\nit.\" To which he replied\u2014\"Why, I did hurt my nail in the night.\nI woke at about 4.30, and seeing signs of daylight got up to try\n\fOCT., 1908. Cases. 285\nto close the outside shutters, damaging my finger nail in the\nattempt.\" He then showed me his nail which was torn in rather a\npainful way.\nI asked if he had called out, or spoken when he did it, for\nthough I remembered nothing, I thought it possible a cry, or an\nexclamation might have penetrated to my brain through my sleep.\nHe was certain he made no sound, being anxious not to wake me,\nand returned to bed perfectly satisfied that he had not done so.\nE. BAUMER WILLIAMS.\nMr. Williams adds :\nI confirm the above statement of facts. In trying to close the\nshutters I was most careful to be very quiet in order not to disturb\nmy wife. I even abstained from looking for scissors to trim the\nbroken nail lest I should make a noise.\nTHORNTON ARTHUR WILLIAMS.\n36 Downshire Hill, Hampstead.\nEEVIEWS.\nLa Psychologic Inconnue : Introduction et Contribution d I'Etvde Experi\nmental des Sciences Psychiques. Par EMILE BOIRAC (Paris, 1908.\nPp. 347).\nTHIS book, as the author himself tells us, consists largely of articles\nwhich have appeared in various reviews and periodicals between\nthe years 1893 and 1903, to which have been added some unpub\nlished papers. It would perhaps have been better if he had frankly\nretained the form of a collection of separate Essays, for a large\namount of repetition makes the book unsatisfactory regarded as a\nsystematic exposition of either facts or theories. A certain unity is,\nhowever, given to it by the attempt running through the whole to\nre-establish Mesmer's theory of animal magnetism\u2014that is, an\neffluence or \"psychic force\" emanating from some human bodies\nwhich influences some other human bodies. This psychic force is,\nin M. Boirac's view, the probable agent not only in various hypnotic\nphenomena, but in telepathy and in the physical phenomena of\nspiritualism (telekinesis). Comparatively few persons either radiate\nit or experience any effects from it in any noticeable degree. He\nbelieves, however, that the mass of mankind can serve as conductors\nof it (a property which they share with metallic wires), and suggests\n\f286 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1908.\nthat it is because they are perfect conductors that no effect is\nproduced on them.\nThe most interesting parts of the book are the accounts of the experi\nments on which M. Boirac's conclusions are based, for he has been\nsingularly fortunate in finding several excellent hypnotic subjects,\nand is himself a successful hypnotiser\u2014or, shall we say, radiator of\npsychic force. Unfortunately the experiments are very inadequately\ndescribed. Some of the most important of them\u2014those recorded in\nchapter vii.\u2014were criticised by Dr. Walter Leaf in our Proceedings1\nin a review of one of the articles now republished, and were sub\nsequently discussed in a correspondence between Dr. Leaf and M.\nBoirac in the S.P.R. Journal for March, 1896. In these experi\nments local effects of attraction, of anaesthesia, and various sensations\nwere produced on one Gustave P., when M. Boirac held his hand at\na short distance from different parts of his subject's body, or when\na third person in contact with M. Boirac did so. The young man\nwas blindfolded, and M. Boirac speaks repeatedly and emphatically\nof the importance in such experiments of preventing any information\nabout what was being done reaching the subject through any of his\nsenses. Nevertheless, in the absence of a more complete account\nthan he gives us of the precautions taken, it is difficult to feel sure\nthat he was fully aware of the great difficulty of blindfolding com\npletely2 or of making quite sure that all auditory indications, or\nindications from radiation of heat or from air currents are excluded.\nGranting, however, that M. Boirac did succeed in avoiding indica\ntions through the ordinary channels of sense, it is not at all clear\nwhy he considers it proved that the effects produced were due to\ndirect action between the hand and the part of the body pointed at,\nand not, on the contrary, due to mental suggestion. With this\nsame subject he appears to have been very successful in inducing\nand removing the hypnotic state by mental suggestion alone\u2014simply\nwilling that he should sleep without looking at him, and even when\nseparated from him by a closed door.3 This telepathic effect M.\n'Vol. XI. p. 599.\n2 In his chapter xiii. on \" Un cas d'appareute transposition des sens,\" M.\nBoirac describes experiments at a later date with one Ludovic S., which\nsuggest very much that his method of bandaging (the same that he used with\nGustave P.) left opportunities of seeing similar to those found by Mr. Hodgson\nin attempting to reproduce the conditions of experiments with a supposed\nclairvoyant subject \"Dick.\" (See Journal S.P.R., Vol. I. p. 84).\naSee chapter x. The instances given are fairly convincing, but it is unfor\ntunate that M. Boirac does not seem to be in the habit of keeping full notes\n\fOCT., 1908. Reviews. 287\nBoirac attributes to his \"animal magnetism\" operating between one\nbrain and the other. Why may not a similar action of one brain\nor mind on another suggest to the subject that the effect associated\nwith, e.g. M. Boirac's right hand pointing at the knee is to be\nexpected ? The nature of the effect thus associated may of course have\nbeen originally due to the percipient's imagination. Indeed, the want\nof constancy in the effect of a pointing hand is in itself a sufficient\nreason for doubting the theory of a direct physical action, and\nseems to point to a subjective mental cause. For instance, in one\nseries of experiments with Gustave P. one effect was produced when\nthe right hand was used and another with the left hand. This\ndifference was not expected by the operator, and was not observed\nwith other subjects, nor did it occur with Gustave P. himself in\nexperiments repeated after an interval of eight months.\nTo sum up briefly, if we could feel quite sure that all means of\ninformation or suggestion through the senses had been adequately\nexcluded, M. Boirac's experiments would afford valuable confirmation\nof experiments by other observers (described in our Proceedings and\nelsewhere) in the production, apparently by telepathic suggestion\nalone, of \"sommeil a distance,\" of local anaesthesia, and of com\nmunity of sensation. They would thus be very encouraging, but\nthey would not, in our opinion, add to our knowledge of the nature\nof telepathy, and much less would they prove either the existence\nof the \" animal magnetism \" or \" psychic force \" vaguely conceived\nby M. Boirac, or its conductibility.\nM. Boirac offers his hypothesis or discovery of the conductivity\nof the human body to psychic force as likely to be of great\npractical importance to psychical research by furnishing a method of\nexact experimentation to those who are not themselves fortunate\nenough to radiate the force. We follow his argument so far as\ntelekinesis is concerned, for there is no doubt that if by merely\nholding the hand of a medium any investigator were able with his\nother hand to raise a table off the ground without contact (which\nseems to M. Boirac probable) telekinesis would soon be an accepted\nfact. But it is less easy to follow him as regards thought trans-\nof his experiments. We should like to have been told how many attempts\nwere made, what proportion (if any) failed, and whether Gustave P. was at\nall liable to go spontaneously into the hypnotic state during the seances when\nno attempt was being made to produce it. It is the more important to know\nthese things, because the time required to produce the effect by willing it\nvaried.\n\f288 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1908.\nference. Here he puts the agent, ignorant of the idea to be trans\nmitted, between the investigator and the percipient. \"Le sujet\nn'aura besoin,\" he says, \"pour comprendre ma pensee, que de la\nrecevoir a travers cet intermediate accoutume.\" But how, if the\ninvestigator is incapable of generating the psychic force necessary\nfor thought transference, is his idea to get to the agent for trans\nmission except through the ordinary channels of sense ? This there\nis no attempt to explain, and it seems to us typical of the some\nwhat loose and vague way of handling theories which pervades the\nbook.\nE. M. S.\nVitality, Fasting and Nutrition. By HEREWAED CARRINGTON.\nPp. xxxix, 648.\nThe main object of this treatise is to show the value of \"fasting\nas a cure for disease.\" Appropriately enough, then, the writer\nbegins with a series of chapters devoted to a consideration of the\nnature of disease. He promises \"to show that what little the\nmedical profession is supposed to know of the nature of disease is\ntotally wrong, that their theories of the origin and nature of disease\nare erroneous db initio, and that every new discovery made, which\nthey have considered an unmixed blessing and a sign of progress,\nhas in reality only led them further and further from the truth,\nand away from an understanding of the real cause and cure of\ndisease.\"\nIt need not surprise us to find that he does not succeed in show\ning this, but it is astonishing that he should make no attempt to\ndo so. Mr. Carrington asks ue to cast aside the results of a century\nof scientific research into the causation of disease and to accept\nunreservedly the opinion of a few faddists that all disease is due\nto the retention within the system of effete material derived from\nan over-abundant food supply. \"All disease,\" he says, \"is in\nreality a curing process\u2014the various diseases, so called, being but\nthe various methods of elimination, from the system, of effete\nmaterial unduly retained therein, which should have been eliminated.\"\nThe process of elimination gives rise to the symptoms of each\ndisease, and these symptoms have been mistaken by the medical\nprofession for the disease itself. To suppress these symptoms is\n\"the whole aim, goal, and ambition of the medical fraternity.\"\nThis is, of course, mere nonsense. The medical fraternity know\nas well as Mr. Carrington that the first indication for treatment\nin any disease is to remove the cause, if possible. Where they\n\fOCT., 1908. . Reviews. 289\ndiffer from him is in regard to his opinion that all diseases are\ndue to the same cause or that they are all amenable to the same\ntreatment. In so far as his work is intended to appeal to the\nmedical profession, Mr. Carrington should surely have seen the\nnecessity of establishing on sound evidence this fundamental point.\nInstead of attempting to do so he seems to think we are to be\nsatisfied by a few quotations in support of his contention, culled\nfrom some more or less obscure writers of the so-called hygienic\nschool, but, \"as Mr. MacFadden remarked,\" or \"as Dr. Trail so\nwell expressed it,\" is hardly the form of argument we need to\nconvince us that the whole edifice of medical knowledge is based\nupon false foundations.\nHaving pointed out that the symptoms of disease are merely\nevidences of remedial efforts on the part of the organism, he asks,.\n\" What is it that lies behind these symptoms 1 What is the real\ncause of disease ? \" The reader who anticipates any satisfactory\nreply to this question will be disappointed. He gets merely the\ndictum of Mr. Carrington : \" To this I answer\u2014it is the poisonous\nand effete matter which has collected within the organism.\" He\ndoes not give a particle of evidence in support of this opinion.\nI have searched carefully through the whole of this book, and I\nhave failed to find a single fact which can, even remotely, be held\nto prove its truth.\nHaving convinced himself that all disease is due to the presence\nof uneliminated food material, Mr. Carrington feels bound to believe\nthat fasting is the one and only therapeutic measure to be adopted\nin every form of illness. He makes a curious distinction between\n\" natural \" and \" unnatural \" means of assisting nature in its\nremedial efforts, and in support of his contention that fasting is a\n\" natural \" mode of dealing with disease, he says : \" Turn to first\nprinciples ; revert to Nature ; look to the animals\u2014wild preferably\u2014\nwho live nearer to nature than does man, and see what animals do\nunder such circumstances. In following them we cannot go far\nwrong.\" Mr. Carrington is manifestly perturbed by the fact that\ndogs, when ill, sometimes eat grass, but he considers this a perver\nsion of instinct due to domestication. In any case, he says that\n\"dogs only eat grass when they are slightly sick\u2014'out of sorts,'\nas we say, and possibly need the salts and other elements the\ngrass contains, in order to restore them to health ! \"\nBut it would appear that Mr. Carrington appeals to \" first\nprinciples\" only when it suits his purpose to do so. In the chapter\n\f290 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1908.\ndealing with the quantity of food necessary to maintain health, or,\nas he prefers saying, to sustain life, he endeavours to show that\nwe all eat far too much and too often, and are all diseased in con\nsequence. \"It is true,\" he adds, \"that many of the lower animals\nfeed more or less continually, with no other results than continued\nnormal growth ; but, because this is so, can it therefore be argued\nthat man can do likewise, with anything but disastrous results ?\nObviously not.\" An appeal to \" first principles \" fails him here, so,\nfrom a consideration of certain physiological peculiarities wherein\nman differs from the lower animals, he deduces the following law :\n\"The higher in the scale of evolution we proceed, the less the time that\nis actually required for the nutrition of the body.\" As the greatest\nmark of distinction between man and the lower animals is his\nmental characteristics, this law may be expressed in the formula :\n\" The greater the mentality the less the need for food.\"\nThis is the principle to which we must appeal when we are\nwell, although the customs of the lower animals are guidance enough\nwhen we are ill. It is a principle which may be very comforting\nto vegetarians or hygienists, and the ordinary man will be willing\nto concede to them any superiority of mentality they may claim,\nso long as they allow him to have his dinner in peace.\nNot content with advocating complete fasting in every case of\nillness, Mr. Carrington would have us eat as little as possible when\nwe are well. His fear lest the vital energy may be wasted in the\ndigestion of unnecessary food is almost an obsession. The vital\nenergy so consumed might be conserved for the doing of the mental\nand spiritual work of the world. But alas for poor human nature !\nSurely there is an abundance of vital energy being expended\nthroughout the world in ways less worthy even than the digestion\nof unnecessary food.\nSo dear to his heart is his theory of fasting and vitality that it\nis with almost unconcealed regret that Mr. Carrington admits that\nit is necessary to eat a little food sometimes. He confesses that\n\" throughout the course of life it is required. Only in diseased\nconditions is food harmful.\" It is difficult to reconcile this confession\nwith what he says about the laws of health. They govern, he says,\nthe well and the sick equally. He declares categorically that \"those\npractices which are good for the well are equally good for the sick.\nWhat is good for the well man is equally good for the sick man\nand per contra, what is injurious and hurtful to the well man, must,\nof necessity, be equally hurtful and injurious to the sick man.\"\n\fOCT., 1908. Reviews. 291\nThe only conclusion that can be drawn from these contradictory\nstatements is that although Mr. Carrington is forced to admit that\nfood is necessary for the well man, it is not, in his opinion, good\nfor him.\nThe explanation of this persistent casting of obloquy upon the\nfood we eat is to be found in Mr. Carrington's theory of vitality.\nIn a long discussion of this world-old problem he maintains that we\ndo not derive either bodily heat or energy from food. The sole\nfunction of food is the replacement of tissue that has been broken\ndown by the daily activities. Vital energy is a force per se, different\nfrom and not inter-related with or transmutable into any of the\nknown physical forces. It is universal, all-pervading, cosmic, and\nflows into the human frame through the nervous system during\nsleep. The degree to which vitality will flow into us depends on\nthe condition of the body. The cleaner it is and the freer from\nmorbid accumulations, the more vital energy can it absorb. During\na fast the body becomes freed from all impurities; therefore, the\nmore we fast the more vital energy shall we have. Not only is\nthere a greater influx of energy due to the cleansing of the trans\nmitting channels, but further, \"the withdrawal of food places more\nenergy at the body's disposal, for the reason that all the energy\nthat was heretofore expended upon digestion, may now be utilized\nfor other purposes.\" It seems a pity that this pretty scheme of\nthings has ultimately to be assisted by such a vulgar proceeding as\neating; but it is found in practice that if fasting be continued too\nlong it leads to starvation, and starvation, it is admitted, ends in\ndeath.\nWe naturally turn to the records of \"fasting cures\" for evidence\nof the alleged increase of energy during the progress of a fast ; but\nhow difficult it is to find such evidence may be gathered from the\nfollowing quotations from the Chapter on Vitality. On page 296\nMr. Carrington says : \" we find that when food is completely with\nheld, during a fast, the energy does actually increase, and continues\nto do so ... the strength constantly and visibly increases.\" Yet\non page 261 he says: \"it may be urged that this energy should\nbe more and more noticeable as the fast progressed ... for the\nreason that more and more energy would thus be conserved, whereas\nwe know that this is not the case\u2014weakness (at least apparent)\nresulting in the great majority of cases, if the fast be persisted in,\nand not increased strength and energy. The whole difficulty is just\nhere. The energies are increased as the fast progresses, gaining\n\f292 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1908.\nstrength daily because of the fact that no food is eaten calling for\ndigestion, but these energies are not noticed by us after the first\nfew hours of fasting for the reason that, if food is not supplied,\nthey are turned or directed into other channels, cleansing the body of\nits diseased condition, e.g.\"\nStrength which \"visibly\" increases but is \"not noticed by us\" is\nsurely a very elusive thing. Probably, however, Mr. Carrington\nmeans that the increase of strength is not noticed by the victim of\nthe fast, but is quite visible to the onlooker. If so we might\nexpect to find some proofs of this increase of energy in the records\nof fasting cures. But here again, as in the case of Mr. Carrington's\nviews on the causation of disease, the facts that might convince us\nare sought for in vain.\nWith regard to these cases of fasting cures it is to be regretted\nthat the recorders despise or are ignorant of diagnostic methods ;\nfor although we are assured that the patients were very ill before\nundergoing the fasts, and that most of them recovered after the\ntreatment, we are left almost completely in the dark as to what was\nreally the matter with them. Still, these records of \"fasting cures\"\nare not without interest from several points of view ; but to imagine\nthat their publication will have any revolutionary influence on\nscientific therapeutics is mere childishness.\nSpace will not permit of any detailed reference to Mr. Carrington's\nviews regarding the nature of vitality, sleep, death, and bodily heat.\nAs tentative hypotheses they may be legitimate enough in the\npresent state of knowledge ; but until some better verification of\nthem is forthcoming than is to be found in this book they seem\nhardly worth discussing.\nThe course of the argument throughout Mr. Carrington's work is\na good illustration of the tendency of the layman to introduce a\npriori methods into the discussion of scientific subjects. The whole\nhistory of science lies behind him to warn him of the futility of so\ndoing. Yet he cheerfully dilates on scientific matters in the manner\nof the writers of the pre-scientific era, regardless of all the principles\nof empirical logic and ignoring or ignorant of the positive results\nthat have been obtained by the application of scientific method to\nthe solution of scientific problems.\nT. W. MITCHELL, M.D.\n\fOCT., 1908. The Slate-Writing of Mrs. Francis. 293\nTHE SLATE-WRITING OF MRS. FRANCIS.\nBY COUNT PEEOVSKY-PETEOVO-SOLOVOVO.\nREADEES of the Journal and Proceedings will perhaps remember\nthat I repeatedly, when discussing the evidence for the \" Physical\nPhenomena of Spiritualism,\" have drawn attention to some state\nments relating to the \" slate-writings \" of Mrs. Francis, a San\nFrancisco professional medium of many years' standing apparently\n(see for instance Journal, Vol. VIII., p. 182 ; Vol. IX., p. 12 ;\nProceedings, Part LV., p. 394). It seemed to me that these\nstatements, coming as they did from such persons as Dr. Elliott\nCoues and especially1 Mr. W. Emmette Coleman, well known\nas an exposer of fraudulent professional mediums, and describing\ncases when the slate-pencil was seen to write\u2014made it at least\nprima facie probable that such a thing as \" independent slate-\nwriting \" did really exist as a \" fact in nature \"\u2014to quote the\ntitle of a paper by Dr. Coues on the subject in the Religio-\nPhilosophical Journal, February 27, 1892.\nWhen writing in 1899 my Russian book on the Physical\nPhenomena of Spiritualism (see Dr. Leaf's review in Proceedings,\nVol. XV., p. 416) I applied to Mr. Coleman for supplementary\ninformation on the subject, and received from him a letter in\nwhich, while admitting that Mrs. Francis did occasionally cheat,\nhe still maintained his belief in the genuineness of her slate-\nwriting, which he said was remarkable not only from the point\nof view of how it was done but also of what was written, and\nin proof of this he mentioned an instance which certainly seemed\nto point to thought-transference from Dr. Coues. He also stated\nthat he had seen sometimes the pencil write the end of a word\n\u2014the slate being partly withdrawn from under the table ; and\nthat Dr. Coues had according to his statement seen it write a\nwhole sentence.\nI now have to state that my repeated references to Mrs.\nFrancis's slate-writing have at last brought about a result in\nconsequence of my having again mentioned her by name in\nProceedings, Vol. LV., p. 394. Mr. Hereward Carrington has\n]I have certainly not forgotten Prof. Shafeldt's letter in Journal, Vol. IX.,\np. 35.\n\f294 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1908.\nsent me a personal letter, from which I now\u2014with his per\nmission\u2014extract the following passage :\n[Mrs. Francis] uses a cardboard slate, and on it places a small\npiece of pencil. First, she holds the slate just under the table, for a\nfew moments, then above the table, and one can see the pencil\njumping about on the slate, and apparently finishing the writing.\nIt is very convincing, and Dr. Hyslop did not see how it was done\nwhen he had his sitting; but subsequent observation and experiment\nexplained it.\nWhen tho slate is under the table, she stretches out the first\nfinger, places it on the pencil, and scrawls a few words ou the slate.\nThis is all that appears. She then lets the pencil slide down to the\nspot over the last few words. Then she takes the slate out from\nunder the table, and holds it so that part of her hand covers the\nwriting \u2014the last few words. She also keeps moving the slate about,\nas though to prevent the pencil from hopping off the slate on to\nthe floor. The pencil is dancing up and down, apparently just\nfinishing the writing. This is effected as follows : I have stated\nthat the slate is of cardboard. She has rubbed rosin over the first\nfinger, and she draws or rubs this finger over the under side of\nthe slate. The jarring causes the cardboard to vibrate, and the\nsmall piece of slate-pencil is thereby caused to jump up and down,\nand gives the exact appearance of finishing the writing. The\nillusion is perfect, if well done. Dr. Hyslop and I practised it, and\nbecame quite dexterous ! I hope this explanation suffices.\nThus\u2014exit Mrs. Francis\u2014and, I think, I can honestly add,\nprofessional independent slate-writing in general.\nST. PETERSBURG, August, 1908.\n[We have just received from an American Associate of the\nSociety, Mrs. Blodgett, an account, written at the time, of\nsome sittings with Mrs. Francis in 1901, in which similar\nmovements of the pencil occurred.\nMrs. Blodgett, who is a careful and experienced observer,\nreports that while the writing was being done under the\ntable, she and her husband saw movements of the muscles of\nMrs. Francis's arm and shoulder, which convinced them that\nshe was doing the writing herself. Twice, as she took the\nslate from under the table and moved it towards them, they\nsaw the pencil move a little way along the slate. It did not\nappear to write a word, but only to make little marks at\nthe end of a word. '\nMrs. Blodgett obtained a slate and a bit of pencil from\nMrs. Francis to try by herself after she got home, and found\n\fOCT., 1908. The Slate-Writing of Mrs. Francis. 295\nthat she could make the pencil move in a similar way by\npressure of her fingers underneath the slate. She sends us\nthe bit of pencil, which is about a third of an inch long,\npointing out that one side of it is flat and smooth, to facilitate\nits slipping along the slate.\u2014ED.]\nCOEBESPOKDENCE.\nEXPERIMENTS WITH SAMBOR.\n(To the Editor of the S.P.R. JOURNAL.)\nST. PETERSBURG, August, 1908.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014Mr. Baggally's \" explanation \" of Sambor's perform\nances as offered at the Society's meeting on June 29th (July Journal,\np. 273) is entirely wide of the mark. Of course it is not peculiar\nto him. I heard it repeatedly both before and after my special\nexperiments with Sambor on his \"chair-threading'\"' (in 1900 and\n1902), and can only assert most emphatically that my friends and\nI had precisely in view this very source of error when we started\non our investigation, and kept it in mind throughout.\nThat the medium did not use this method at our special seances\n(ten in the spring of 1900 and seven in the spring of 1902) there\nis not the shadow of a doubt; and I beg to refer Mr. Baggally in\nthis connection to the following passages in my articles on Sambor\nin Annales des Sciences Psychigues: 1900, No. 4, p. 249; No. 5,\npp. 267, 271, 274, 297 (text and footnote), which, I think, he\nought certainly to have consulted before making his statement.\nI subjoin two extracts from my notes of the sittings (written out\nthe next day) :\n\"Seance at Schilkin's, February 1st [14th], 1900. Highly suc\ncessful, because a chair was threaded on Kasnakoff's arm, who was\nspecially anxious to get this, and had said to me before that he\nwould believe only after a chair would be threaded on [his own\narm]. In this case the candle was undoubtedly put out by myself\nafter K ff and Siebert had taken up the medium's hands. . . .\"\n\"Seance at my house (February 17th [March 2nd]). In the very\nfirst part [of the seance] a chair was threaded on my arm which\nwas distinctly verified in the light. Loris-Melikoff was holding the\nmedium on the other side. The hands were held (grasped), were\nnot once released either on my side or on Loris's. Admitted by\nall to have been quite remarkable and convincing. All necessary\nconditions fulfilled (chain formed before the light was put out, etc.).\nI was tightly squeezing Sambor's hand . . .\"1\nI will conclude with the following passage from an obituary notice\n1 Cf. Annales, 1900, No. 4, pp. 249, 250.\n\f296 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1908.\nof Sambor I wrote for the Rebus (published in No. 28, 1902,\npp. 259-261):\n\"It is known that some 'investigators' who saw nothing or hardly\nanything themselves explain the extraordinary 'threadings' of chairs\nas if through the medium's arm, which constantly occurred with\nS. F. [Sambor], by the supposition that in the case of such thread-\nings the ' chain ' was formed after the light had been put out ;\nwhich circumstance gave the medium the opportunity, before entering\nthe 'chain,' of slipping an arm through the back of the chair.\n\"Special experiments made by me and other persons in 1900 and\nlast spring have made the inadequacy of such an explanation obvious.\nThe experiment under consideration succeeded in all seven times\nwith seven different persons,1 and in all these cases the light was\nmost undoubtedly put out after the medium had been included in\nthe chain.\n\"But it happened two or three times that the candle was put out\nsomewhat prematurely\u2014well, S.

Nov., 1908.\nREMINISCENT CRYSTAL-VISIONS.\nTHE appended report comes to us through an Associate of the\nSociety, Mr. F. C. Constable, of Wick Court, near Bristol,\nfrom the Eev. H. E., whose name was given to us in\nconfidence.\nThe interest of these visions lies in their origin having been\ntraced through hypnotism. By this means it was found that\nthey all represented subliminal memories of places or objects\npreviously seen, and the special association of ideas which\nrevived the recollection in each case was discovered by the\nsame means. It seems not unlikely that many other crystal-\nvisions, as well as much automatic script, could be similarly\nexplained if the seer or writer could be hypnotised and\ncross-examined.\nMr. H. E. writes :\u2014\nNo. 1.\nOctober 5tk, 1908.\nE. E. P. is a good crystal-gazer and an equally good hypnotic\nsubject. He is a country postman, about 30 years of age, and above\nthe average intelligence of persons of his class.\nOn October 4, 1908, at about 8 p.m., he took the crystal off\nthe table, and immediately said\u2014\"I see such a beautiful room.\"\nHe then described the furniture, pictures\u2014\"an oil painting of a\nlady\"\u2014the fireplace, and particularly the clock on the mantelpiece\u2014\n\"I have never seen such a large one,\u2014it's made of different kinds\nof marble.\" \" Can you see the door ? \" I asked. \" No ; I'm standing\nin the doorway.\" The picture then faded in the usual way.\nI questioned E. E. P. closely as to where the room was,\u2014where\nhe had seen it. He assured me he had never seen such a room\nin his life, and it was such a curious clock he was sure he would\nremember it if he had. I then hypnotised him. He goes into a\nmost profound sleep at word of command,\u2014i.e. instantly. \"Where\nhave you seen the room and the big clock you just saw in the\ncrystal?\" I asked. He replied at once, \"At . When I went\nto London, my cousin was there, and showed it to me. The clock\ncost hundreds of pounds.\" I then woke E. E. P. and told him he\n\fNov., 1908. Reminiscent Crystal- Visions. 299\nhad seen this room and clock, and he must try and remember\nwhere. I am quite sure he honestly tried, for I know the man so\nwell, but he failed. I then told him what he had said when\nentranced. He said at once, \" Yes, that's quite right, I remember\nnow. I went to London about five years ago, and my cousin, who\nwas in a situation at this house, showed me the drawing-room. I\nstood at the door and looked in, and I saw the clock, which was\nvery large and valuable. I can't remember much about the furniture\nnow.\"\nHere then was a case of sub-conscious memory, but what could\nhave induced the picture of this seemingly unimportant incident to\nrevive suddenly in the crystal 1 E. E. P. seemed to think he had\nnever thought of the room again from the day he saw it, for it did\nnot interest him.\nThe explanation seems to me of interest, as it shows what\nextremely minute things may act as suggestions to revive a memory.\nIn the afternoon of the same day (Oct. 4) I had been for a walk\nwith E. E. P. to look at a certain old church at C C . He\nhad been struck by the rather handsome hanging brass candle-\nholders. Under each candle was a glass sconce, and under this a\nknot of cut glass about the size of a nut. E. E. P. stood on one\nof the seats, and took hold of one of these knobs, and partly un\nscrewed the brass screw that ran through it. When, in the evening,\nwe had failed to find what had made him see the drawing-room in\nthe crystal, I entranced him a second time, and said, \" What made\nyou see this place in the crystal?\" He hesitated for a long time,\nand then he said : \" The gas thing in the middle of the drawing-\nroom was all made of glass,\u2014it was beautiful. The little knobs on\nthe candles in the church to-day were made like it, and I suppose\nthat made me think of the place again.\"\nHence the cut-glass knobs on the apparatus for lighting in the\nchurch had suggested the cut-glass chandelier he had seen in the\ndrawing-room, and the rest of the room followed naturally.\nI suppose we may conclude that the memory of this drawing-\nroom revived in E. E. P.'s sub-consciousness at the moment he was\nfingering the cut-glass knobs in the church ? It must also have\npersisted in his sub-conscious memory at least four hours, as that\nwas about the space of time between being in the church and\nseeing the picture in the crystal.\nH. E.\n\f300 Journal of Society for Psychical Besearch. Nov., 1908.\nNo. 2.\nE. E. P. as before.\nOct. 11, 1908. Very tired, and no pictures came for some time.\nThen a piece of material appeared. It was extremely distinct, so\nthat the rows in the weaving could be counted. Running his finger\nup the glass, E. E. P. counted up to 29.\n\"Two rows near the middle seem run together,\" he said.\n\"Is it a flaw in the weaving?\" I asked. \"Yes, the two rows are\nonly one afterwards,\" he replied.\nThe material is a strip of merino, woven as a sample by the young\nwoman to whom E. E. P. is engaged. The girl works in a mill in\nthe north of England. Recently E. E. P. was staying with her\nparents, and the piece of stuff was given him to use as a muffler.\nHe promised to bring it me that I might count the rows.\nOct. 12. The piece of material has been brought to me by E. E. P.\nIt contains 136 ribs in the width, and no flaw. It is about 46 inches\nlong and 8 or 9 wide.\nE. E. P. says to-day, \"I don't think that was what I saw as the\nribs are so fine.\" I shall entrance him and see if I can find anything\nfurther.\nHistory of the piece of material seen.\nOn Oct. 15th at 8 p.m. I hypnotised E. E. P. and asked what\nthe material was he saw on the llth.\n\"It is a piece of knitting E. M. was doing at the S. Evening\nSchool.\" This would have been about seven years ago.\nAfter waking E. E. P., I told him what he had said, but he\ncould remember nothing whatever about the matter. He seemed\nto think it was perhaps a joke with some of the girls in the school.\n\"If so,\" he said, \"F. B. might remember.\"\nI saw F. B. yesterday (Oct. 19th) and he remembered the incident\nclearly. The question I asked him was, \"When you went to the\nEvening School with E. E. P. did you ever have a joke with E. M. ?\"\n\"E. E. P. took E. M.'s knitting up off the desk when she was\nnot looking and I tried to hide it by sitting on it, and ran one of\nthe needles into myself\u2014that's why I remember it.\" Asked as to\ncolour he could not remember. Asked as to size, he thinks it was\nabout 12 or 15 inches long, and about 8 wide. He knows for certain\nit was intended for a scarf.\nThe \" link \" for the memory seems this :\u2014E. E. P. had the scarf\nin his pocket given him by the girl to whom he is engaged. (We\nboth thought this is what he saw in the crystal.) On Saturday he\n\fNov., 1908. Reminiscent Crystal- Visions. 301\npicked some green walnuts, put them in his pocket on top of the\nsilk scarf. They stained large dark patches all over it, and spoilt\nit. Having his mind rather full of this scarf, it called up the other\nthat he had seen the girl knitting 7 years before.\nYou will see this is not nearly such a good case as No. 1.\nNo. 3.\nOct. 15, 1908. E. E. P. with crystal. [This is taken down as\nhe spoke.] \"A ship with two white funnels\u2014lots of people on the\nship\u2014I can see two talking to the captain,\u2014it's going to the right\u2014I\ncan't see faces [in reply to question] but I can see their clothes quite\nplain\u2014It's a pleasure steamer\u2014 [\"If you can see so much, you ought\nto be able to see the name,\" I said.] Yes, it's the Camberwell or\nCamperwell\u2014I can't see if its a B. or a P.\u2014I can see the gold\nbuttons on the captain's coat.\"\u2014There was a great deal more very\nminute description.\nAsked if he knew the steamer, he said he might have been on it,\nas he had been on several pleasure steamers at different times. He\ndid not know the names of any, as he never noticed names that he\nknew of. I tried him several times, but he protested he could not\nremember.\nI then hypnotised E. E. P.\n\" What was the steamer you just saw in the crystal 1 \"\n\"The one I went in from Cardiff to Ilfracombe two years ago\u2014it\nwas the Camberwell.\"\n\"What made you think of it?\"\n\"When I was delivering letters this morning, one had a post\nmark from Ilfracombe and I thought of the trip.\"\nI then awoke E. E. P. and asked him if he had noticed the\npost-mark on any letter that morning. He then remembered the\nIlfracombe one, at once. He added : \" I did think about a steamer\nthis morning, because I thought of the trip I went from Cardiff to\nIlfracombe,\u2014but it only just passed through my mind, and that's\nwhy I forgot it.\"\nHere the memory of the fact was in the conscious memory for a\nmoment or two in the early part of the day. Hence this experiment\nis not as interesting as No. 1, where the memory of the fact was\nonly in the sub-conscious memory.\nH. E.\nOct. 20, 1908.\n\f302 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1908.\nA CURE BY SUGGESTION.\nTHE following case is contributed by a Member of the Society,\nMr. A. Warndorfer, who reported it verbally to Miss Johnson\non January I7.th, 1908, and then discussed it with her.\nHe afterwards wrote to her as follows :\nELISABETHSTRASSE 23, BADEN, NEAR VIENNA.\nFebruary 7th, 1908.\n... I send a short notice about the cured nail. Miss Byatt\nwrote only the other day how delighted she was to have a decent\nlooking thumb again. I spoke to a doctor about it; he said that\n\"naturally the nerves were stimulated by the massage and of\ncourse made the nail grow properly again ; \" which does not\nsound convincing, especially because [there] was no massage.\nA. WARNDORFER.\nThe account enclosed was as follows :\nI have tried for several years to treat occasional ills amongst\nmy family and friends by \" mesmeric \" or \" magnetic passes,\" some\ntimes with verbal suggestions, sometimes without. About two\nmonths ago, Miss Byatt, a young lady staying with us, complained\nabout pains in her thumb, the first digit of which had been caught\nand crushed in the breach of an air-gun more than four years ago ;\nshe said [she had suffered] from these pains frequently since the\naccident. The nail had to be partly removed at the time and\nhad grown in a rather crippled manner, the side being strongly\nfluted and the back of the nail quite wavy ; the part where the\n\" moon \" usually is had, since the accident, never been hard, but\nwas more like a thick transparent skin than a nail ; it turned\nblue and felt sore when the hand was put into cold water. I\nquickly succeeded in removing the pain and then determined to\ntry to \"cure\" the thumb, i.e. make the nail grow properly. To\nmy great pleasure the nail is now almost normal; the upper half\nstill shows the old defects, but what grew since about six weeks\nis quite hard and smooth ; at the edge there is still a fluted part,\nbut much less than formerly. I am quite willing to give further\ndetailed information.\n\fNov., 1908. A Cure by Suggestion. 303\nMiss Johnson then asked for answers to the following\nquestions :\n(1) When did the accident take place and what (exactly)\nhappened ?\n(2) What measures were then taken to cure the thumb\nand what followed ?\n(3) When did Mr. Warndorfer begin to operate and what\nwas the exact condition of the thumb when he began ?\n(4) What process did he use ; and how soon (a) was the\npain removed ; (&) did the nail grow again ?\n(5) What was the exact condition of the nail at the time\nof writing ?\n(6) A propos of the doctor's suggestion that the results\nwere due to massage\u2014were the \" passes \" made with contact\nor not ?\nA propos of the perhaps more rational supposition that the\ncure took place in the ordinary course of nature, and was\nnot really assisted by the treatment\u2014\n(7) Did the condition remain stationary for a long time\n(and if so, for how long) and then suddenly improve under\nMr. Warndorfer's treatment, or had it been gradually improving ?\n(8) Had there been any perceptible change in Miss Byatt's\ngeneral health,\u2014any improvement in which would help all\nhealing processes,\u2014since she went to Austria ; and how soon\nafter she went did Mr. Warndorfer's treatment begin ?\nDetailed statements on all these points were asked for\nfrom both Mr. Warndorfer and Miss Byatt.\nMr. Warndorfer replied as follows :\nMarch 13th, 1908.\n(1) The accident happened about four and a half years ago ; the\nthumb was caught in the breach of an air-gun and was held there\nfor some time, as the gun could not be opened.\n(2) I think surgical treatment was necessary and part of the\ninjured nail taken off.\n(3) I began to operate, I think, about the middle of November,\n1907 ; the nail was sore at the time and I made passes, to take\nthe pain away ; I did not at first consider the possibility that the\ngrowth of the nail could be altered. I was told that at irregular\nintervals the nail caused pain and that it felt sore, always, when\n\f304 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1908.\nput into cold water. The nail looked crippled as indicated in the\nsketch ; it was very fluted at the side, extending to about one third\nof the breadth of the nail, the rills being deep and hard. The\nlower portion of the nail, where the \"moon\" usually is, was soft,\nyielding to light pressure and very tender to the touch, pressure\ncausing pain and making the use of the thumb almost impossible\nfor some kinds of work ; the sight of the thumb as a whole, was\nunpleasant.\n(4) To alleviate the pain I made passes; I may have touched the\nthumb, but only inadvertently ; the pain disappeared after the first\ntreatment, which lasted for about a quarter of an hour; I employed\nverbal suggestion too. Afterwards, when trying to influence the\ngrowth of the nail, I employed the mixed system of \"magnetic\npasses\" and verbal suggestion that is, I think, adopted by most\nmen who use psycho-therapeutic methods. As I could, without verbal\nsuggestion, cause stiffness of the thumb, coldness of the hand, etc.,\nI used those phenomena, to strengthen the suggestion that my treat\nment would be successful. I never used massage proper but some\nfew times made slightly touching passes (efflemant la peaw) ; at the\nend of each treatment I used to make a couple of rubbing passes\nfrom hand to shoulder, to remove all feeling of heaviness in the limb ;\nsometimes I used a pencil-like piece of magnetised steel (as practised\nin the early Mesmerist schools and by a doctor friend of mine) ;\nat first it caused a strong sensation in the nail, but after a while\nit did not and then I gave it up. I treated her almost daily ; when\nI was away from home for a couple of days, I made her put her\nfinger in the morning into a glass with \"magnetised water;\" I found\nthis process useful for different reasons.\n(5) I cannot say, at what time the improvement began, as such\ncould only be visible on the growing nail ; now, or rather when I\nsaw the nail for the last time, about five weeks ago, there was\nhardly any disfigurement to be seen, except a few flutings (rills)\nat the side ; the nail was quite hard and caused no pain or\n\fNov., 1908. A Cure by Suggestion. 305\nunpleasant sensation when put into cold water, was, in fact, normal\nand healthy, smooth and shining.\n(6) The contact was very slight. I know what massage is, having\n[gone through] a course of instruction in it ; what I did has nothing\nto do with massage.\n(7) Of course, every cure [may] be attributed to ordinary causes ;\nthe long period of the abnormal condition, four and a half years,\nwould however make it a very unlikely coincidence, and I think it\nwould hardly be fair to attribute the cure to coincidence, all the\nmore as the condition of the nail was stationary for several years\nand began to improve with the treatment.\n(8) A general improvement in health went with it, and I hope it\nwill not be considered too audacious an assumption if I reverse your\nsuggestion. You think that the improvement of the nail went with\nan improvement in health, caused by change of climate, while I\nventure to say that the improvement in the nail and the improve\nment in health were caused by my treatment. Miss Byatt came\nover [at the] end of August, I think, and joined us about the\nmiddle of September; the improvement in health, which made\nitself felt by an increase in weight and by the absence of regular\nheadaches, can be traced (especially the latter) to the beginning of\nthe treatment; the climate in autumn and winter is not such as to\ncause any improvement in general health ; in fact, she caught a\nsevere cold, or rather bronchitis, which kept her indoors for some\ntime. I should like to mention that I did not undertake the\ntreatment on my own responsibility ; I never do. I consulted an\nM.D., a friend of mine, who agreed to my method and who saw\nthe result; he is at present in England, I think, but I do not know\nhis address. I dare say he will be back here in spring, and I can\nthen add his testimony.\nOn April 29th, 1908, Mr. Wiirndorfer wrote again:\nEnclosed you find Miss Byatt's report about the treatment and\ncure of her thumb. There appears to be a discrepancy between my\nstatements and hers about [the improvement in her state of health] after\ncoming over. I still do not think that the improvement [accounts]\nfor the thumb's cure, as the improvement began and continued while\nher health was not good, or at any rate not better than usual. I\nhave within the last week cured a bruise on her wrist in a similar\nmanner.\n\f306 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1908.\nMiss Byatt wrote as follows :\nApril 27th, 1908.\n(1) In July, 1903, I injured my right thumb by pinching it\nbetween the barrel and steel rod of an air-gun. It was pressed\nsideways, and was cut rather deeply on the outside just above the\njoint and inside just at the bottom of the nail. It bled profusely,\nand my wrist had to be bound up to stop it, as the nearest doctor,\nwho was wired for, lived six miles away, and we had to wait about\nthree hours before he came.\n(2) When he came he syringed it well with disinfectant, as some\nrust from the gun had got in. The thumb was very swollen and\npainful for some days, and my arm was kept in a sling. A small\nabscess formed under the root of the nail, which had to be scraped\naway in order to dress it.\n(3) In course of time the nail came off, and when the new one\nformed it came with an ugly seam right down it at the side where\nit had been injured. An edge of the seam turned into the thumb,\nand was always rather painful when pressed, and the \" half moon \"\nwas quite soft. Also, the outside of the thumb has a lumpy scar,\nwhich was sensitive when pressed and quite painful if knocked.\nWithin the last two years, whenever the nail was cut, the skin\nround the top of the thumb got red and sore as if it had a touch\nof eczema. As far as I can remember and have noticed, there has\nbeen little perceptible improvement in the condition of the whole\nthumb during the four and a-half years since it was hurt, until Mr.\nWarndorfer started treating it on Dec. 7th last, about two weeks\nafter I came here.\n(4) The treatment lasted from 10 to 15 minutes almost every\nevening for six weeks. He made me sit easily on a chair with all\nmuscles relaxed, and he sitting on another chair opposite me, holding\nmy hands with his thumbs pressed against mine, obliged me to look\nstraight into his eyes for perhaps two minutes, then getting up closed\nmy eyes while he stood in front of me and made passes before my\nface, as far as I knew, for at this stage I was fairly drowsy, then\nstroked my arms firmly down to my fingers, pressed his thumbs\ngently in the hollows above collar bones, causing me involuntarily\nto take long deep breaths giving the most soothing effect, made\nmore passes down the arms and the length of the body to the feet.\nAfter that I moved my chair round, and, resting my arm on the\ntable, he made passes close above my thumb with all his fingers\ntogether, sometimes using a small steel bar, which had been [mag\n\fNov., 1908. A Cure by Suggestion. 307\nnetised]. Then I held the thumb up, and, without touching it, he\nput his fingers round it and made a drawing movement as if he\nwere pulling something out. Often during this treatment, and when\nthe steel was continually passed close to the seam on the nail, I had\na tickling sensation as if something inside the thumb were moving.\nDuring the last week or so I believe he also breathed on the nail,\nbut I am rather vague as to the whole treatment, as it made me\nso sleepy.\n(5) After perhaps two weeks there was an improvement in the\ncondition of the nail ; it was much less painful when pressed, the\n\" half moon \" was harder, and the whole thumb less sensitive, and\nthe skin at the top softer. It continued to improve rather quickly,\nand at the present time its condition is quite normal, except for\nthe scar in the flesh on the outside of the thumb and the seam up\nthe nail, though the latter is much less noticeable than formerly, and,\nconsequently, not such an eyesore as it always was to me before.\n(6) The passes on the thumb were always made, I believe, without\ncontact, and (7) the condition had been stationary before the treatment,\nwhich ceased towards the end of January, when we went away to\nSwitzerland for eight weeks.\n(8) I certainly think my general health has improved since I came to\nAustria at the end of last September. During the first five weeks I\nwas in Baden I went up 5 kilo, over 10 English pounds in weight,\nand I got fatter. I have felt very well since I have been here, and\nonly early in January, when the weather was rather severe, got a\ncold, and was kept in the house for nearly a fortnight. During that\ntime Mr. Warndorfer treated me several times for the cold, and did\nme much good.\nThough my health may have improved, it hardly seems possible\nthat it could account in that short time for such a sudden improve\nment in the thumb nail, and in the four years before I left England\nI had lived a regular healthy country life.\nCONSTANCE E. BYATT.\nMr. Warndorfer wrote that he would try to get a statement\nabout the cure of the nail from the doctor referred to in his\naccount of March 13th, 1908; but that this doctor, who was\na firm believer in the efficacy of suggestion and used it largely\nin his practice, had only seen the case a few times. This\nbeing so, we have not pressed for his statement, which has not\nyet reached us.\n\f308 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1908.\nMr. Warndorfer regretted that it had not occurred to him\nat the beginning to photograph the nail in its crippled state,\nand at intervals during the treatment, so as to provide tangible\nevidence of the result. We should like to recommend any of\nour readers who may have an opportunity of trying similar\nexperiments in the suggestive treatment of simple ailments to\nuse photography in any cases that admit of it.\nHALLUCINATIONS EXPERIENCED IN CONNECTION\nWITH DYING PERSONS.\n(1)\nTHIS case was sent to Dr. Hodgson by Dr. Burgess, an Associate\nof the American Branch of the Society. It took place in 1902\nand was recorded in August of that year. The percipient, sitting\nat the bedside of his dying wife, had a vision of several figures,\nincluding the \" double \" of his wife. The vision persisted for\nfive hours and vanished at the moment of her death. It was\nnot seen by any of the other persons who were in the room.\nThe doctor, who was present, testifies that the percipient was\nin a perfectly normal state before and after and that there\nwere features in the vision that would not have been likely\nto occur to him. The interest of the case is psychological,\nits most marked peculiarity the prolonged persistence of the\nhallucination.\n373 GEARY STREET, SAN FRANCISCO,\nAugust 28, 1902.\nDEAR DR. HODGSON,\u2014With the kind permission of my friend\nDr. Renz I send you a verbatim copy of the papers relating to\nthis very interesting case, and you are to feel at liberty to make\nwhatever use of it you may think advisable.\nLet me add that, while I have not asked for Mr. G.'s identity,\nI know Dr. Renz well as a valued coadjutor on the staff of the\nCalifornia Woman's Hospital.\nThe Doctor is an expert in diseases of the mind and nervous\nsystem and is eminently qualified in every way to form a just\nestimate of the features of this case. You will correctly infer that\nnone except Mr. G. saw the appearances described.\nVery truly yours,\n0. 0. BURGESS.\n\fNov., 1908. Hallucinations. 309\nMr. G.'s statement is as follows :\nWhether I was labouring under a mental delusion or whether I\nwas gifted with clairvoyant sight during the last five hours\nimmediately preceding the death of my wife is, at the present\ntime, a mooted question with me, and one that I fear will never\nbe satisfactorily determined by me.\nBefore telling the story, and for the benefit of any who may\nread this paper, I will state that I am not addicted to the use of\nalcoholic liquors, cocaine, or morphine, being almost strictly tem\nperate ; nor am I nervous or imaginative, but considered cold, calm\nand deliberate, and a disbeliever in what is known as materialization,\nspiritualism, or the existence of spiritual bodies visible to mortal\neyes, and hostile to all such theories.\nAs all my friends know, my wife died at 11.45 p.m. on Friday,\nMay 23, 1902; and, after four o'clock upon the afternoon of that\nday, I became convinced that her death was merely a question of\nmoments.\nGathered around the bedside awaiting her demise were some of\nmy most intimate friends, the physician in attendance, and two\ntrained nurses. I was seated at the bedside holding my wife's\nright hand. Our friends were grouped around the room, some sitting,\nsome standing, not a word was spoken, each watching intently the\nfaint breathing, the cessation of which would indicate that the soul\nhad left the body. Two hours passed and still no change. The\nservant announced dinner. No one was inclined to partake of the\nrefreshments offered. At half-past six o'clock I urged our friends,\nthe physician and nurses, to take dinner, as their vigil might lengthen\nout too long for them to abstain from food. All but two left the\nroom in obedience to my request.\nFifteen minutes later, or at 6.45 (the reason why I am so positive\nas to the time is because a clock was upon the bureau in plain\nsight), I happened to look towards the door, when I saw floating\nthrough the doorway three separate and distinct clouds in strata.\nEach cloud appeared to be about four feet in length, from six to\neight inches in width, the lower one about two feet from the ground,\nthe others at intervals of about six inches.\nMy first thought was that some of our friends (and I must ask\ntheir pardon for the thought) were standing outside the bedroom\nsmoking, and that the smoke from their cigars was being wafted\ninto the room. With this idea, I started up to rebuke them, when,\nlo ! I discovered there was no one standing by the door, no one\n\f310 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1908.\nin the hallway, no one in the adjoining rooms. Overcome with\nastonishment I watched the clouds; and slowly, but surely, these\nclouds approached the bed until they completely enveloped it.\nThen, gazing through the mist, I beheld, standing at the head of\nmy dying wife, a woman's figure about three feet in height, trans\nparent, yet like a sheen of brightest gold; a figure so glorious in\nits appearance that no words can be used fitly to describe it. She\nwas dressed in the Grecian costume, with long, loose and flowing\nsleeves\u2014upon her head a brilliant crown. In all its splendour and\nbeauty the figure remained motionless with hands uplifted over my\nwife, seeming to express a welcome with a quiet, glad countenance,\nwith a dignity of calmness and peace. Two figures in white knelt\nby my wife's side, apparently leaning towards her ; other figures\nhovered about the bed, more or less distinct.\nAbove my wife, and connected with a cord proceeding from her\nforehead, over the left eye, there floated in a horizontal position a\nnude, white figure, apparently her astral body. At times the sus\npended figure would lie perfectly quiet, at other times it would\nshrink in size until it was no larger than perhaps eighteen inches,\nbut always was the figure perfect and distinct : a perfect head, a\nperfect body, perfect arms and perfect legs. When the astral body\ndiminished in size, it struggled violently, threw out its arms and\nlegs in an apparent effort to escape. It would struggle until it seemed\nto exhaust itself, then become calm, increase in size, only to repeat\nthe same performance again and again.\nThis vision, or whatever it may be called, I saw continuously\nduring the five hours preceding the death of my wife. Interruptions,\nas speaking to my friends, closing my eyes, turning away my head,\nfailed to destroy the illusion, for whenever I looked towards that\ndeathbed the spiritual vision was there. All through those five hours\nI felt a strange feeling of oppression and weight upon my head and\nlimbs ; my eyes were heavy as if with sleep, and during this period\nthe sensations were so peculiar and the visions so continuous and\nvivid that I believed I was insane, and from time to time would\nsay to the physician in charge: \"Doctor, I am going insane.\"\nAt last the fatal moment arrived ; with a gasp, the astral figure\nstruggling, my wife ceased to breathe ; she apparently was dead :\nhowever a few seconds later she breathed again, twice, and then\nall was still. With her last breath and last gasp, as the soul left\nthe body, the cord was severed suddenly and the astral figure\nvanished. The clouds and the spirit forms disappeared instantly,\nand, strange to say, all the oppression that weighed upon me was\ngone ; I was myself, cool, calm and deliberate, able to direct, from\nthe moment of death, the disposition of the body, its preparation\nfor a final resting place.\nI leave my readers to determine whether I was labouring under\na mental delusion caused by anxiety, sorrow and fatigue, or if a\nglimpse of a spirit world of beauty, happiness, calmness and peace\nwas granted to my mortal eyes. ~\n\fNOV., 1908. Hallucinations. 311\nAppended are comments by Dr. Eenz, the physician in\nattendance :\nTo the annexed statement I would like to add a few words. I\nknow the gentleman who gives such a vivid and realistic description\nof his experience at the deathbed of his wife personally long enough\nto exclude every possible tendency to any form of chronic mental\nalienation. By his friends and associates he is considered an ex\ntremely calm, level-headed and strong-willed business man. Never\nat any time have illusions or hallucinations\u2014never any form of\ndelusions\u2014been observed during his life, which has been full of\nexcitements and changes in business as well as in family relations.\nFrom my own observations I can most positively put aside a tem\nporary acute state of hallucinatory insanity during the time of the\nvision mentioned above. The reasons are as follows : I had been\nwith Mr. G. during the entire illness of his wife ; we spent a good\nmany days and nights together, and I had the opportunity of making\na study of his thoughts and feelings. I had occasion to know that\nMr. G. never read anything in the occult line ; that everything\nthat was not a proven fact was incompatible with his positive\nmind,\u2014so much so that during his vision (of which I did not\nknow at the time) he asked me frequently if I thought he was\ngoing to become insane.\nExactly one week previous to his wife's death, at a time when\nshe was so low that I was expecting the end at any moment, Mr. G.\ndid not experience any abnormal sensation of any kind. At that\ntime Mr. G. did not lose hope as to her rallying, although from a\nmedical standpoint Mrs. G. was apparently in extremis.\nAs soon as Mrs. G. was dead, Mr. G., who for six hours was\nsitting, almost motionless next to her, rose and gave all his orders\nin such a calm and business-like way that it surprised all who were\npresent. If he had laboured under a hallucination his mind would\nnot have become clear as suddenly as it did. It is now two and\none-half weeks since the death and the vision. Mr. G. is absolutely\nnormal physically as well as mentally. He has attended to his\nbusiness as usual and, besides, fulfilled many extraordinary duties.\nC. EENZ.\n(2)\nThis is another instance of an apparition seen by a person\nin the company of a dying woman, though the form\nseen is more shadowy than in the previous case. It occurred\non Nov. 1st, 1905, and was recorded on Nov. 23rd of the\nsame year. The percipient is a sister of a member of the\nSociety who is known to Miss Johnson.\nIt seems to have been a fully externalised hallucination\nand not apparently due to any emotional or morbid mental\n\f312 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1908.\nor physical condition on the part of Miss V. Z., who said\nthat she had seen patients die before and took it entirely\nas part of her work. She took no special interest in this\npatient. She writes :\nNovember 23rd, 1905.\nOn Nov. 1st while acting as Nurse-Probationer at a Cottage\nHospital I had an interesting experience.\nMrs. S., a patient suffering from cancer and admitted to the\nHospital about five months previously, was on the morning of\nNov. 1st apparently dying ; she had been unconscious for about\nfive hours and was breathing at the rate of three to the minute.\nHer pulse was taken at 12.0 by another nurse and I was then\nleft alone in the ward with instructions to notify any change in\nher condition and prevent the flies from settling on her. I was\nseated by the bedside and reading a magazine article, from time to\ntime glancing at the patient. About five minutes past twelve (there\nwas no clock in the ward) as I looked up I saw on the opposite\nside of the bed a figure; I say a figure, because it was the shape\nof a person, although no features were distinguishable and the whole\nappearance seemed to be a thick mist or fog with no sharp outlines\nbut a blurred edge. The height was about my own, 5' 7\". There\nwas a window on either side of the bed, and a screen with a wooden\nframe covered in holland was behind the figure. I noticed the\nedges of the screen were visible through the misty shape. I felt\nno sense of fear at the sight of the figure, though I was not inclined\nto address it. I put down my book and watched it for some time,\nso far as I could judge between ten and fifteen minutes, then another\nnurse entered the ward and the figure faded or melted away. The\npulse in the neck of the patient was still beating, but she was not\nthen breathing, although when I first saw the figure she was.\nThere was a good light, the day being bright ; the windows reached\nalmost to the ceiling and the time was mid-day. The other patients\nhad dressed and left the ward as Mrs. S.'s groaning disturbed\nthem. A person standing on the flower-bed outside and looking in\nwould only have thrown a shadow of the upper part of the shoulders,\nunless very tall, whereas the figure I saw was visible to where the\nknees should have been and then the outline of the bed cut off\nthe view. It had not the appearance of a shadow and was quite\ndistinct from and some distance from the screen. I did not mention\nthis experience to any one at the hospital.\n. V. Z.\nHer sister adds :\nI understand the figure stood near the head of the bed, by the\nshoulders of the patient.\nE. Z.\n\fNo. CCLIV.\u2014VOL. XIII.

SAGE on \" The alleged Miraculous\nHailstones of fiemiremont \" was read by MRS. A. W. VERRALL.\nThe following is a brief abstract of the paper :\nOn May 20th, 1907, a procession in honour of the coro\nnation of a certain famous image of the Virgin in the parish\nchurch of Remiremont had been arranged by the clergy to\ntake place, but at the last moment was forbidden by the\nmunicipal authorities. On the following Sunday, May 26th,\nRemiremont and the neighbouring village of St. Etienne were\nvisited by an unusually violent hailstorm. Some of the hail\nstones were of exceptionally large size, and it was alleged that\na considerable number of persons saw on them a representa\ntion of the above-mentioned image of the Virgin. The parish\npriest, M. Vuillemin, made careful enquiry into the facts in\norder to report them to his ecclesiastical superiors, and col\nlected the depositions of over a hundred witnesses, who stated\nthat they had seen the image on the hailstones.\nOne of our foreign Members having drawn attention to the\ncase and kindly offered to defray the expenses of an enquiry\ninto it, M. Sage was asked to undertake it, and went to Remire\nmont in September of the present year.\nThrough the courtesy of the clergy he obtained introductions\nto many of the mos't credible witnesses and was able to cross\n\fDec., 1908.

He collected a number of statements from\nthem about their own impressions, and also obtained full\ninformation about the events leading up to them, and earlier\ntraditions in connection with the image, which was an object of\nspecial veneration in the neighbourhood. His general conclusion\nwas that many of these witnesses had actually seen on the\nhailstones something more or less resembling the image, though\ngenerally only after the appearance had been suggested to them;\nand that this impression was an illusion, probably based on\nthe conformation of the large hailstones, some of which were\nstated to consist of a central opaque mass, surrounded by a\ntransparent layer, while the external surface was again more\nopaque.\nPROFESSOR BARRETT said there were two points of interest in\nthis paper, one meteorological and the other the influence of\nsuggestion in creating an epidemic delusion. As regards the\nmeteorological,\u2014hailstorms are usually accompanied with violent\nelectrical disturbances in the atmosphere, and very large hail\nstones, such as occurred on this occasion, are by no means\nuncommon. Hailstones are also not infrequently met with\nhaving a series of concentric shells alternatively of opaque and\ntransparent ice ; the latter being due to the extrusion of air,\nwhich when intermingled gives the whiteness and opacity to\ntransparent crystals of snow or salt. The central nucleus of\nthese concentric hailstones is generally, as was here noticed,\nan opaque and somewhat irregular mass of hard snow. Very\npossibly an excited imagination might imagine some resemblance\nto a face in this nucleus and the transparent ring around\nmight give rise to the suggestion of the traditional corona of\na saint.\nThe psychological interest of this case is the ease with\nwhich a suggestion, once made, causes others to perceive a\nsimilar illusion. An instance of this occurred some years ago\nin a village called Knoch, in a country district in Ireland.\nHere, on the whitewashed gable of a small Roman Catholic\nchapel, a peasant stated that he saw one evening a miraculous\nlight which appeared to him a radiance from the figure of the\nVirgin or the scene of the Crucifixion, I am not sure which,\nthat he imagined he beheld. He told the story, and on a\nsubsequent evening others affirmed they saw the same miraculous\nA2\n\f318 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1908.\nvision. There is some doubt as to the origin of the light ; it\nmight have been the glare from a distant hand lamp, or it might\nhave been a practical joke. Anyhow, in spite of the parish\npriest discrediting the story, numbers visited the district and\nthe light was seen by several. Convinced of its miraculous\ncharacter the whitewashed gable became a shrine to multitudes\nof Catholic peasants, so that many hundreds of people flocked\nto it to adore and be cured of physical infirmities. For a\ntime it threatened to rival Lourdes, as the most amazing cures\n\u2022were undoubtedly brought about. Portions of the plaster of\nthe gable were carried away until the rough stones were laid\nbare as far up as could be reached. I asked a friend to visit\nthe place, take some photographs and report to me. One\nlarge photograph, which I have at home, shows the gable hung\nwith a long double row of crutches left by those who had\nbeen cured, and in front a vast kneeling crowd of peasants.\nFew more striking instances could be found of the therapeutic\nvalue of suggestion when accompanied by emotional exaltation.\nADDEESS TO THE DUBLIN SECTION OF THE S.P.E.\nBY SIR OLIVER LODGE, F.R.S.\n[A SECTION of the S.P.E. has been founded in Dublin, with\nthe Eev. Dr. Barlow, Vice-Provost of Trinity College, as Chair\nman, Professor W. F. Barrett as Vice-Chairman, and Mr. E. E.\nFournier d'Albe as Hon. Secretary.\nDuring the recent visit of the British Association to Dublin\nthis Section gave a largely attended complimentary luncheon\nto Sir Oliver Lodge, F.E.S. ; who, in response to a toast, made\na speech of which the following is a shorthand report :]\nMr. Chairman, Sir Archibald Geikie, My Lord Bishop, Dean\nBernard, Ladies and Gentlemen,\u2014I need not add much to\nwhat Professor Barrett has told you with regard to the\nfoundation and objects of our Society. It was founded\ntwenty-six years ago for the purpose of investigating certain\nextraordinary facts which had been stated and described in a\nmore or less confused manner for centuries, and had aroused\nthe interest of a comparatively small scientific and literary\n\fDBO., 1908. Address to the Dublin Section of the S.P.R. 319\ngroup in London. Those facts, as stated at this time, with\nsome notable exceptions, appeared to be so mingled with\nconfused superstition as to be useless ; and the whole subject\nimperatively demanded proper investigation. Such investiga\ntions have been since carried through on scientific principles\nby the S.P.R\nAs this is, I believe, your first reunion of this kind, you\nwill naturally expect me to say something concerning the\npresent state of the investigations which are being carried on.\nBut first let me congratulate you upon having secured as your\nVice-Chairman a man of the great experience and enthusiasm\nof Professor Barrett, under whose guidance you may be\nexpected to make substantial progress. I must equally con\ngratulate you on having secured the services of that ingenious\nand accomplished physicist who fills the office of your Honorary\nSecretary. Mr. Fournier d'Albe has been for many years\nengaged in reviewing for us the progress made in Physical\nScience on the continent, and has summarised it, each week,\nin a very able manner. In fact he keeps us up to date.\nYou have here in Ireland a great deal of promising material\nfor investigation. The west of Ireland is especially, I believe,\nrich in legendary lore, and in traditions of supernormal\nphenomena. To analyse these, to extract from them their\nresidue of genuine fact, and to disentangle it from its admix\nture with fiction, will be an attractive and important function\nof your Section. I do not wish to suggest that I object\nto fiction. Fiction is one of the things which help to make\nlife worth living and which lift us above the dry detail of\neveryday life. But in the class of phenomena with which we\nhave to deal, I cannot too strongly impress upon you the\ndanger of admitting the slightest trace of fiction to your\nstatement of facts. Your facts must be incontestable. A slight\ntrace of fiction is capable of destroying the value of a very\nlarge amount of fact. We must stringently apply those\nprinciples which have been found trustworthy in the develop\nment of science during the last few centuries. It is only thus\nthat we can hope to make lasting progress in the solution of\nthe problems with which we are confronted.\nNow you may ask what progress has been actually made\nby these methods. I answer that we have certainly\n\f320 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1908.\nestablished the reality of telepathy. The fact of telepathy\nitself is now becoming almost generally accepted. Whether\ntelepathy, or the transfer of thought from one mind to another\nwithout any material link between them, and without the\naction of the recognised senses, is an ordinary faculty common\nto all mankind, or whether it is only found in certain favoured\nindividuals, I am not prepared to decide. That is a matter\nfor future study. As regards the phenomena of clairvoyance,\nthere is still a great deal in doubt. For one department of\nit, that is to say, water-finding or dowsing, considerable evidence\nhas already been accumulated, notably by the exertions of your\nChairman of to-day (Prof. Barrett). Another important and\nextremely interesting set of observations are those on prediction\nor prophecy. In this case we must carefully distinguish between\nlegitimate inference from known facts, and such predictions as\nare quite unconnected with previous experience and with facts\nknown to the persons concerned. A great deal of work remains\nto be done in this department alone. Next come the so-called\nPhysical phenomena, such as movement of objects without\ncontact. There is but little doubt in my mind that such\nmovements do take place : I have had personal experience of\nthem. Nevertheless they are not yet really established as\nfacts, and if they were, there would still be a question whether\nthese movements are due to some independent intelligent\nagency, or whether, as is most likely, they are an extension\nof the ordinary power of the organism through which they are\nproduced. I can move this tumbler with my hand, but the\nquestion remains whether I can move the same tumbler at a\ndistance of a couple of feet from my hand, without actually\ntouching it. Note that there is nothing inconceivable about\nthis. The boundary of an organism as of anything else is\nmore or less arbitrary ; we know that in a sense a vortex\nring exists not only where it is seen, but at some distance\nalso, and that the influence of every atom extends throughout\nthe visible universe. And so perhaps, on analogous lines, we\nmay look for some explanation of these curious occurrences\nwhich will not take them altogether beyond the reach of more\nordinary experience.\nWhat our Society has done most work upon is automatic\nwriting and trance speaking. These two classes of phenomena\n\fDEC., 1908. Address to the Dublin Section of the SP.R 321\nhave a decided interest of their own, since through them we\nobtain messages purporting to come from intelligences of our own\nkind, and as a rule from some of our deceased fellow-creatures.\nYou know the kind of phenomena I mean : I do not mean\nthe so-called trance-preaching to Sunday audiences. In auto\nmatic writing the subject or medium holds a pencil in his\nhand, and the hand is guided, or moved without the\nactive will of the writer, to form certain written characters\nwhich spell out a more or less coherent message. In trance\nspeaking, it is not the hand but the vocal organs of the\nmedium which are used : again without his conscious inter\nvention or control. Now both these classes of phenomena\nare capable of several degrees of stringency in their treatment,\nand I may say generally that the stringency of the tests which\nwe have been able to apply to them has been gradually\nincreased for the purpose of eliminating not only the unconscious\nmental action of the writer, but also telepathy from living\npeople.\nFrom the first, and throughout, we have received messages bear\ning a certain distinctive character, and having all the appearance\nof originating in some intelligence which was quite distinct from\nthat of the medium. The impression of originality and indivi\nduality thus conveyed is very strong to those immediately\nconcerned, but it is not sufficiently evidential to rank as a\nscientific demonstration. Since the year 1900 conditions have\nimproved ; and quite recently a new method, the method of\ncross-correspondences, seems to have been developed. This\nmethod will, no doubt, loom large in the future ; and it is\nappropriate therefore that I tell you something about it to-day.\nLet me \" explain : in such a way as to give a general idea\nof the process, without any inappropriate attempt at exactitude,\nor at actual record. There are three automatic writers, let us\nsay : Mrs. Piper in America, Mrs. Verrall in Cambridge, and\nMrs. Holland in India. All these receive automatic writings\nthrough their hands two or three times per month. These\nwritings are regularly sent in to Mr. Piddington or to Miss\nAlice Johnson in London, and they are compared from time\nto time to see if there is any connection between the various\nmessages received from the three writers on any given day\nor week. If the three writers wrote the same identical\n\f322 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1908.\nmessage\u2014it would not be the kind of evidence we want, for\nit would clearly suggest telepathy between them. The message\nmust not be intelligible to each separately, but must become\nluminous when put together. To take an imaginary example,\nsuppose Mrs. Piper got the words \" British Association \" written\nthrough her hand. Suppose that at the same time Mrs. Verrall\ngot the word \" Dublin.\" And suppose also that Mrs. Holland\ngot something about a \" Meeting \" at the same time, there\nwould obviously be some correspondence between these three\nthings. But since telepathy has become an established fact,\nsuch correspondence is not sufficient to establish the agency of\nan independent intelligence apart from the automatic writers.\nIt would be quite legitimate to suppose that the three writers\nwere in telepathic communication, and that some idea of the\nBritish Association now meeting in Dublin was transmitted\nfrom one to the other. But now take a further step :\u2014suppose\nthat in the case of Mrs. Piper the words \" Francis Darwin \"\nwere written. That name does not suggest Dublin, and it\ndoes not suggest a Meeting. Suppose also that in Mrs. Verrall's\nwriting the words \" Parliament of Science \" or some still more\nroundabout phrase occurred. That would not suggest the name\n\" Darwin \" except to those in the inner councils of the British\nAssociation. Lastly suppose that Mrs. Holland automatically\ndrew the figure of a harp or a shamrock. In that case no\nsuggestion of either our President Mr. Darwin, or of the\nBritish Association or of Dublin, would naturally be aroused.\nAnd simple telepathy, being thus eliminated, by similar auto\nmatic precautions intensified on these lines, we should be\nreduced to the only alternatives,\u2014either that there is some\nintelligence independent of all three writers influencing them\nat the same time, or that the three writers are fully conscious\nof what they are writing and that they have arranged a little\nplot among themselves. To those who know the circumstances\nunder which the writings are obtained the latter possibility is\nquite excluded. Well, we do get evidences of this kind. And\nfurther, we sometimes get messages which point to a given\nindividual as control. We get, for instance, three such separate\nnames as Eupert, Constance, and Stephen, which obviously do\nnot suggest each other, introduced without meaning in the\nmidst of other matter ; one by one medium and one by another.\n\fDEC., 1908. Address to the Dublin Section of the S.P.R. 323\nThese turn out to be the names of three children of a deceased\nperson who at the time is purporting to communicate : and\nthe names are given as proof of identity.\nThis is the method of cross-correspondence. It was not\ndevised altogether by experimenters on this side ; it seems to\nhave been partly invented or at any rate improved and developed\nby some members of ours who have crossed the boundary. We\nare beginning almost to speak about the S.P.R. on the other\nside, which is quite as active and even more ingenious than\nthat portion which is still on earth. Much of the evidence\nwhich has come to hand will shortly be published in our\nProceedings, But I may anticipate its publication somewhat,\nby quoting one or two of the most remarkable instances. [The\nspeaker then referred to two or three instances, which have\nsince been published in Mr. Piddington's paper on \" A Series\nof Concordant Automatisms \" in the Proceedings of the S.P.R.,\nVol. XXII., pp. 19-416. One of these is connected with a\npassage from Browning's poem \" Abt Vogler,\" which was selected\nby one of the Controls as a remarkably appropriate expression\nof an essential feature of cross-correspondence, and is reported in\ndetail on page 59 et seq.; while another relates to a test question\ncarefully contrived by Mrs. Verrall to put to the \" Myers \"\ncontrol of Mrs. Piper, as to whether the words \" OI!TO? oupavo?\nO.KU\/J.WV\" which are a special quotation from Plotinus, meant\nanything to him : these words being of course mere gibberish\nto Mrs. Piper herself. For a full account of this episode see\npages 107, etc., of the paper just referred to; while a third\nand most complicated group of cross-correspondences is the\n\"East and West\" set, reported on pages 241-281.]\nThese are among the best evidence for a separate and\npeculiarly \" Myers \"-like intelligence which we have yet attained.\nIt is not of course complete, but it is singularly good. We\nhope yet to reach a scientific demonstration of a future life.\nIt is true, as we are often assured, that such a demonstration\nis not required in religion, since faith is independent of it.\nBut faith can be strengthened, even in the religious mind ;\nwhile, in the mind which is more purely intellectual, some such\ndemonstration is increasingly called for. It is enough to know\nthat we are progressing, and progressing at a sufficiently rapid\nrate. We need not be in haste ; we may possess our souls\n\f324 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1908.\nin patience. Let me tell you a little story which illustrates\nwhat I mean. In Liverpool there is a steam ferry which\ntakes people across the Mersey to Birkenhead. It touches at\neach landing stage for a short time, and it is not unusual to\nsee people in a hurry jump across the gap between the landing\nstage and the boat after it has started, rather than be left\nbehind. It happened the other day that a ludy in a great\nhurry to reach the other side managed successfully to jump\nacross the gap, though with the exertion she fell upon the\ndeck. To the boatman who helped her up, she said, \" That\nwas a close shave,\" to which he replied\u2014\" It was, ma'am, but\nyou needn't have been in such a hurry, for the boat is\ncoming in.\"\nWe need not be in a hurry either. Our boat is coming in.\nI believe that a new era of intelligent and critical acceptance\nis pending for the work we have in hand. I hope that you\nin Ireland may take a large and valuable share in that work,\nand I wish you well in your future task of sane and balanced\nand careful investigation.\nOBITUAEY.\nEDWARD T. BENNKTT.\nWE regret to record the death on November 16th of Mr. E. T.\nBennett, who for nearly twenty years was Assistant Secretary\nof our Society, at the age of 77. Mr. Bennett's long and\nintimate connection with the Society began at the Conference\nheld in London, on January 6th, 1882, which led to the founda\ntion of the S.P.E. I had not met Mr. Bennett before that time,\nbut was so much struck with his quiet, unassuming manner and\nbusiness aptitude, combined with deep interest in and know\nledge of the subjects that had brought us together, that I agreed\nwith Mr. Dawson Eogers\u2014who had assisted me in convening\nthe Conference\u2014in asking Mr. Bennett provisionally to act as\nHonorary Secretary. This he did, and the Council of the Society\n(subsequently formed) ratified the selection, so that during the\nfirst year of the Society's existence Mr. Bennett acted as our\nHonorary Secretary, as will be seen from Vol. I. of our Proceed\n\f., 1908. Obituary. 325\nings. Owing to the rapidly-increasing office and clerical work of\nthe Society, Mr. Bennett, at no little self-sacrifice, found it\nnecessary to relinquish his other duties in order to devote himself\nto the business of the Society. Under these circumstances the\nCouncil offered him a small salary, and he became Assistant\nSecretary when Mr. Edmund Gurney undertook the office of\nHonorary Secretary towards the close of 1882.\nFor many years Mr. Bennett carried on the business work\nof the Society, and his unfailing courtesy, ready helpfulness,\nand sympathetic attention to every member who sought his\nassistance or brought a case for investigation, will not be\nforgotten by those who knew him. Personally I was much\nindebted to him, for whenever I was unable to attend a Council\nmeeting, he kept me in touch, by periodical letters, with the\nwork going on in the Society. It would have been difficult\nto find a more honourable, unselfish, painstaking and inde\nfatigable secretary than Mr. Bennett. The Council showed\ntheir appreciation of his long and faithful service when failing\nhealth compelled him to retire in Easter 1902, by a resolution\nrecorded in the Journal of the Society, and by requesting his\nacceptance of a retiring allowance, at the same time electing\nhim an Hon. Associate of the Society.\nUpon leaving London, Mr. Bennett took a house at Port\nIsaac, North Cornwall, where he resided until his death. His\ninterest in the S.P.E. and his literary activity did not cease\nwith his retirement. He published a series of handbooks on\nPsychical Eesearch, in three of which he gave a useful outline\nof various phases of the Society's work together with other\nevidence. The fourth of these books, On the Direct Phenomena\nof Spiritualism, was issued in the present year and deals with\nmore debateable phenomena, some of which indeed, in my\nopinion, are of very slight evidential value. However here,\nas in other matters, Mr. Bennett had the courage of his opinions,\nand moral courage\u2014such as was required of him and other\npioneers a quarter of a century ago\u2014more than compensates\nfor what some of us may consider scientific errors of judgment.\nMr. Bennett's public interests were not confined to psychical\nphenomena. Like so many other members of the Society of\nFriends, to which body he belonged by birth and early associa\ntions, he was an active worker in many fields of social reform.\n\f326 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1908.\nIn temperance work his services were in constant request, and\nhis pen was rarely idle. He started, financed, and edited The\nBritish Women's Temperance Journal so long ago as 1883, when\nthe late Mrs. Lucas, sister of John Bright, took the movement\nwarmly in hand.\nFor many years Mr. Bennett lived in Richmond, Surrey,\nand the Mayor of that town recently stated that his own early\ncareer owed much to our departed friend. The Richmond local\nnewspaper, in the course of an appreciative notice of Mr. Bennett,\nremarks : \" One of the most valuable things that he accom\nplished in Richmond was beyond doubt the setting on foot of\nthe Saturday night concerts at the College Hall, which proved\nso attractive during a long series of years. Of these he used\nto say that he was convinced while the hall was full the\npublic-houses were proportionately empty. His influence in\nthe relations of personal daily life was always thrown steadily\nupon the side of righteousness and temperance with much\nvaluable effect.\"\nIn the notice of his death, contained in the organ of the\nUnited Kingdom Alliance, the curate-in-charge of the church\nat Port Isaac writes of Mr. Bennett's death, \" Thus ends one\nchapter of a most unselfish and beautiful life, which has been\nan inspiration to all of us who have been privileged to know\nhim.\" And to this I would add the tribute of my old friend\nand fellow-member of the Council of our Society from the\ncommencement, Mr. Podtnore, who knew Mr. Bennett even better\nthan I did, and who, in concluding his obituary notice of our\nlate Secretary in Light, speaks as follows : \" A man of singular\nmodesty and kindliness, without malice and without guile, faith\nful in duty, and loyal to all allegiances, he has done his life's\nwork and has entered into his well-earned rest.\"\nI am sure our members will join me in expressing our\ndeepest sympathy with Mrs. Bennett who survives her husband.\nW.

It was found that\nthe roof of the Exchange had collapsed through the force of the\nexplosion, injuring about 20 persons, mostly clerks.\nTheir injuries were chiefly to the head. There was a procession\nof cabs bearing the victims to the hospital. Pathetic scenes were\nwitnessed when the relatives and friends of brokers and their clerks,\nengaged in the Stock Exchange, flocked to the hospital and were\nunable to recognise in the shockingly disfigured sufferers their own\nhusbands, brothers, and sons.\nROME, Dec. 31.\nThe explosion was caused by an escape of gas, and the noise was\nlike that of a bomb. The glass roof of the ante-chamber to the\ncentral hall of the Bourse was completely destroyed, and the ante\nchamber was half wrecked, the doors being torn from their hinges.\nOne of the corners is in a tottering condition. Large numbers of\ntroops, detectives, and police have gone to the spot to assist in the\nwork of clearance. In the confusion, it was thought at first that\nmany stockbrokers had been injured, but it was found that the\nmajority of the twelve persons injured were employees of the post\nand telegraphic service, and that the brokers on the floor of the\nhouse escaped.\nThe origin of the explosion has been explained by the statements\nof two messengers employed at the Bourse, who are among the\ninjured at the San Giacomo Hospital.

The clerks of the Banca d'ltalia engaged in this\nwork were, fortunately, able to save the securities, and the verifica\ntion was accomplished as usual.\nAnother gas accident occurred here to-day, a gasometer exploding\nnear the Piazza Colonna.

Telepathic dream.\nMiss EDMUNDS dreamed that she saw a vision of Mr. Stewart\nBrown whilst his father (in the room below) was thinking about\ncrystal visions and trying to imagine he saw his son who had\ndied four months before. Miss Edmunds had seen a miniature\nof Mr. Stewart Brown but had not met him. The following is\nMiss Edmunds's account :\u2014\nOn Wednesday, June 3rd, Dorothy showed me a miniature of her\nbrother Stuart, who died last February 5th, and whom I have never\nseen.\nOn Thursday, June 4, I went upstairs at nine and undressed in\nthe dark so as to enjoy the lights in the distance through the open\nwindows. I loitered, and several times sat on the sofa by the\nwindow looking towards the Town Hall. It was 9.30 before I was\nin bed, when I fell asleep almost immediately. I awoke from a\ndream soon after ten. (I judged the time, not from my watch, but\nfrom hearing the clock strike eleven (what seemed to be) nearly an\nhour after awaking.)\nI dreamed that I was awake and sitting on the sofa looking down\nthe hill towards the lights among the trees, just as I had sat before\ngoing to bed, when suddenly one of the lights took the form of a\nhuman face among the trees. I was so surprised that I rose up\nand went nearer to the window and exclaimed aloud :\n\" What an astonishing thing, that looks exactly like the face of\nStuart Brown ! \"\nThe face immediately smiled ; the eyes lit up and looked right\ninto mine, and the face came swiftly towards me through the trees,\nwhen, just as it got near the window, it vanished, and I awoke\n\fDEO., 1908. Cases. 329\nand heard footsteps in a closet which is next to the room I\noccupied.\nThe dream was so vivid that I could, on awaking, mentally recall\nthe face and compare it with the miniature which I had seen the\nday before. It was like the miniature, but life size and radiant\nwith light and expression, coming out of the light at which I had\nbeen looking.\nThe dream wakened me so thoroughly that I did not sleep again\nuntil after twelve.\nI related the dream to Mrs. Brown at breakfast time after Mr.\nBrown had gone, and asked her if she went to the closet and\nwhether she thought of Stuart at the time. I thought in the night\nthat such might be the case.\nBefore mentioning the dream to Mr. Brown in the evening, Mrs.\nBrown asked him what he was thinking of when he went to the\ncloset the night before. He could not remember thinking of any\nthing special excepting in connection with some boots which he\nplaced on a shelf, and which he had not worn since in camp last\nsummer ; but he interrupted me, or tried to, when I began to tell\nhim my dream and spoke of sitting at the window and looking at\nthe lights. After I had finished telling my dream he related the\nfollowing, which he wrote immediately after.\nLucY EDMUNDS.\nJune 5, 1896.\nMr. Brown's account is as follows :\nOn the evening of June 4, 1896, about 10.10 p.m., I was sitting\nin the parlor facing the bay-window looking south-west, reading the\npaper. My mind wandered from the reading to thoughts of Myers'\narticles on Crystal-Visions, which I had read a day or two before.\nLooking out of the window I thought of Stuart, wondering if it\nwere possible for his face to appear to me and with a great longing\nthat I might see him. I wondered if I could be susceptible to such\nvisions, but as I had never experienced anything of the kind, in a\nfew moments gave it up.\nAfter attending to one or two household duties, I went upstairs\nat 10.20 as I noticed by the clock. On reaching my room the first\nthing done was to put away a new pair of shoes, moving at the\ntime an old pair which I had not worn since I was in camp with\nStuart last August.\nThis evening Miss Edmunds and Mrs. Brown questioned me as\nto whether I went into the closet and if my mind was fixed upon\n\f330 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEO., 1908.\nanything definite at the time. I could remember only the shoes,\netc., but as the questions only applied to that time I could not\nspecify anything else.\nMiss Edmunds then began to tell her dream ; when she spoke of\nlooking out of the window in her room, where the outlook is almost\nprecisely the same as the one I looked from in the parlor, I tried\nto interrupt her, to tell of my thoughts about crystal visions and\nwish to see Stuart, because I felt there was some connection with\nMiss Edmunds' dream ; but Mrs. Brown is such a stickler for good\nmanners that she would not permit the interruption, and insisted\nupon my hearing the whole dream before I said anything !\nHENRY TEMPLE BROWN.\nJune 5, 1896.\nMrs. Brown writes :\nMiss Edmunds related to me her dream of seeing Stuart's face\nthis morning before leaving for Boston.\nEVA A. BROWN.\nJune 5, 1896.\nMiss Edmunds adds :\nMr. Brown's \"interruptions\" occurred before I had mentioned\nseeing the face, or spoken of Stuart, in fact before I had begun\nthe dream itself; but Mrs. Brown was eager for him to hear the\ndream, so that I scarcely noticed the interruption at the time, but\nremembered it afterwards.\nL.

May I, therefore, be allowed to\nput it into print, so that it may receive an answer through the\nJournal ?\nAre there any indications in the unpublished records which can\nexplain why it was necessary to spell out the Latin Message audibly\nto Rector, in order that it might reach MyersP ?\nIt is quite understood, of course, that the written communications\npurport to be made through Rector as amanuensis, but this does not\nexplain why MyersP cannot dispense with Rector as an inter\nmediary when he receives a message.\nThe problem applies equally whether we suppose that MyersP is\nreally F. W. H. Myers or that Myersp is a trance-personality of\nMrs. Piper's. In the latter case the extraordinary knowledge mani\nfested in Mrs. Piper's script can only be accounted for by assuming\nthat her trance-personalities have access to the thoughts\u2014the unex\npressed thoughts\u2014in other minds. If so, why could not the trance-\npersonality have grasped the contents of the Latin Message if it\nhad been unexpressed, and simply silently transmitted word by\nword to MyersP 1\nIf the spirit hypothesis is adopted the question still remains, for\naccording to this hypothesis MyersP ought to be able to receive\nunuttered thoughts.\nIt is quite conceivable that at the moment when he is attempting\nto communicate MyersP may be incapable of receiving unuttered\nthoughts, for in an earlier report of Mrs. Piper's trance a communi\ncator, Margaret M., is reported as saying, \" Your thoughts do not\nreach me at all when I am speaking to you, but I hear a strange\nsound and have to half guess. . . . (Don't you see me at other\ntimes 1) Oh yes . . . much better than I do when I try to speak \"\n(Proceedings, Vol. XIII., pp. 520, 521).\nThis does not quite explain my difficulty, however. The Latin\nMessage might have been inarticulately formulated with thought\nconcentration before the trance began. Would it in that case have\nbeen received equally well by MyersP 1\nYours faithfully,\nH. A. DALLAS.\nWe sent Miss Dallas's letter to Mr. Piddington, who replied\nas follows :\nThe point raised by Miss Dallas is not one capable of solution in\nthe present meagre state of our understanding of trance-phenomena.\n\f332 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1908.\nBut I can explain the practical reasons which led me to spell out\nthe words of the Latin Message to Eector, in order that they might\nreach MyersP.\nAt the present time, and for a good many years past, Rector,\nwith rare exceptions into which I need not enter, acts as inter\nmediary and amanuensis or spokesman for both sides ; that is to\nsay, he receives messages from the \"spirits,\" and by writing or\nspeech conveys them to the sitters ; and he receives oral messages\nfrom the sitters and conveys them to the \" spirits.\" In other words,\nall communication is effected through Rector, and he is the only\n\"spirit\" who communicates and is communicated with directly.\nRector does not understand Latin (v. Proceedings, Vol. XXII., pp. 314\nand 337), and consequently to make sure that he should transmit\ncorrectly sounds unfamiliar to him, the Latin words were spelt out\nto him letter by letter.\nAlthough I believe that the trance-personalities, whether spirits or\nnot, do obtain telepathically from the sitters and others at least a\npart of the information they display about matters unknown to\nMrs. Piper's normal consciousness, there is no reason for assuming,\nas Miss Dallas seems to do, that this involves their having unlimited\nor even extensive access to the unexpressed thoughts in other minds,\nfor we have never met with any case of telepathic faculty even\napproximating to such a degree of proficiency. The utmost that\nwe can say of telepathy, as we know it, is that it means an occasional\naccess to some of the thoughts in other minds. The knowledge\nmanifested in Mrs. Piper's trance\u2014extraordinary though it is\u2014\ncertainly does not represent more than a minute proportion of the\nideas which are present or latent in the minds of her sitters or\nother persons. And all the experiments with her go to show that\nthough the sitters' thoughts may occasionally be transmitted to her,\nthere is no guarantee that this will happen on any given occasion.\nThe experiment of the Latin Message was in any case an exceed\ningly difficult and complicated one, and it only partially succeeded.\nIf we had complicated it still further by attempting to transmit the\nmessage telepathically, it would probably have failed altogether.\nThe question remains : What is the real relation between Rector\nand Myersp, and why is there this apparent difficulty of communi\ncation between them ? I do not, of course, profess to be able to\nanswer this question, or even to suggest any satisfactory solution of\nit. But I may point out that the phenomena shew a remarkable\nconsistency in that the difficulty of communication is not confined\n\fDEC., 1908. Correspondence. 333\nto one side ; for, just as Rector appears to find it difficult to transmit\nunfamiliar words to MyersP, so MyersP appears to find it difficult\nto transmit unfamiliar words to Rector. Examples will be found in\nProceedings, Vol. XXII., pp. 165-167, where Rector writes \"llliard\"\nfor Iliad; p. 332, where \"Evelyn Hope\" was first given by Rector\nas \"Evangelical\"; and pp. 371-3, where \"Vol,\" \"Volgar,\" \"VM,\"\n\"A B Volugevar,\" aud \"Volugur ABt\" represent Rector's attempts\nat Abt Vogler.\nIt is a fact of great interest that the words \" Plotinus,\" \" Homer's\nIliad,\" \" Abt Vogler,\" and \" that out of three sounds he frame, not\na fourth sound, but a star \"\u2014these words constituting four of the\nbest proofs of supernormal acquisition of knowledge displayed in the\ntrance during the English sittings with Mrs. Piper\u2014were, so it was\nrepresented, all given to Rector by MyersP after \"Hector had left\nthe light,\" i.e. after the conclusion of the trance, or at any rate after\nthe conclusion of the trance-writing (v. Proceedings, Vol. XXII., pp.\n165, 170, 369, 373, 383, and 389). Only in these four cases was\nthis particular method of communication between MyersP and\nRector said to have been employed, and in each case a striking\nsuccess was achieved. If success had not thus invariably followed,\none might have thought that the mention of this particular tnodus\noperandi was merely a bit of unmeaning dramatisation ; but in view\nof the constant success attained, I think we are bound to believe\nthat some different method of communication between Rector and\nM3'ersP, and one more likely to prove effective than the ordinary\nmethod, was really employed. If Mrs. Piper returns to England it\nmight be well to urge the trance-personalities to have recourse more\nfrequently to this exceptional method than they have had in the past.\nJ. G. PlDDINGTON.\nII.\nREMINISCENT CRYSTAL VISIONS.\n(1)\nI WISH to point out that the editorial note to the report of the\ncases, printed under the above title in the Journal for November,\n1908, p. 298, would appear to ignore the most important feature.\nThe first experiment is (perhaps) unique with reference to the\nquestion put to E. E. P. when he was hypnotised a second time.\nThe question was : What made you see this place in the crystal ?\n\f334 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1908.\nThe answer, given after long hesitation, was, \"The gas thing in the\nmiddle of the drawing-room was all made of glass\u2014it was beautiful.\nThe little knob on the candles in the church to-day were made like\nit, and I suppose (my italics) that made me think of the place again.\"\nThis answer shows that E. E. P., under hypnotism, was using his\nunderstanding\u2014he was thinking personally. Not only this\u2014it also\nsuggests that he was using his understanding to determine a question\nof relative thought which he could not have done if not hypnotised.\nThere was no question of \" subliminal memories \" ; there was active\npersonal thought in the use of stored ideas.\nSo far as the experiment goes it is against the theory that hypnotism\ncauses any exaltation of faculty. It suggests rather that, not the\nunderstanding of the patient, but the environments of his under\nstanding are affected by hypnotism, so that he can use his under\nstanding to better effect.\nIt was in reference to what I have above stated that in the (unpub\nlished) note I sent with the cases a wish was expressed for further\nexperiments on the same lines.\nIf we wish to arrive at any working theory of what hypnotism\neffects we should, I think, try to determine how the understanding\nof the patient operates under hypnotism as distinct from the opera\ntions of his understanding when not hypnotised, and this experiment\nwith E. E. P. appears to me to point the way to, perhaps, a new\ndeparture in the investigation of hypnotic phenomena.\nF. C. CONSTABLE.\n(2)\nWEST THURROCK VICARAGE,\nGRAYS, ESSEX.\nIt is a long time since I read an article which interested me more\nthan the evidence of Rev. H. E. on Reminiscent Crystal-visions. For\nyears I have had the idea (shaved, doubtless, by other members of\nthe S.P.R.) that the \" visions \" in crystal gazing, as well as many\nof the alleged visions of \" Spirit Guides \" and shadowy figures of\ndeceased relatives of sitters (as, professedly, seen by mediums), are\ndue to the reflex action of the sitter's brain, and thus do not\nrepresent real scenes (or real persons) occurring at the time, but\nsimply a renewal and transmission from the brain of the sitter to\nthe brain of the medium of impressions long gone by, and which\nwe are apt to imagine cannot be reproduced, either accidentally or\n\fDKC., 1908. Correspondence. 335\npurposely. Take an instance, viz., a sitter goes to a medium to\nenquire concerning a deceased relative. The medium believes he\nactually sees the deceased person, accurately describes the dress\nworn, the features, peculiarities, name, etc., but all the time may,\nunknown to himself, be simply reproducing the mental visual\nimpressions in the sitter's mind. In such case, we may well con\nceive the alarm or surprise of the latter at the latent impressions\nthus re-conveyed, and having all the appearance of reality. The\nexistence of this power, and the curious psychological state which\nfavours it, ought to be a warning to experimenters, and prevent a\nlot of self-deception, as well as unconscious fraud. The nearest\nparallel I can think of is the putting on (after years) of an old\ngramophone record containing the registered voice of the dead, and\nthen mistaking the result for the actual efforts of the present, sup\nposed living, unseen singer.\nBut there are, too, other phases of the matter also worthy of\nconsideration, viz., firstly, the effect of a thrilling story told into\nthe ear may result in producing an impression as vivid as a visual\none, and the scenery and characters of the story (be it false or\ntrue) may, to the hearer, have, under certain conditions, all the\nappearance of reality, and I may even go so far as to say that\nthe scenery and characters of the story may be transmitted to the\nbrain of a medium, being seen by him mentally as realities. Secondly,\nwe are so \"fearfully and wonderfully made\" that even the sugges\ntion of a name or the least hint from an operator to a subject,\neven without hypnosis, may evoke quite a number of old impres\nsions\u2014ten, twenty, forty years old\u2014which become re-clothed with\nall their ancient vividness, and appear actualities of the present.\nWe can, further, imagine them transmitted from person to person.\nTo illustrate the first phase, I need only refer to an experiment\n(to which I was a witness) some years ago, when the Congress of\nExperimental Psychology met at Gower Street (the late Prof. H. Sidgwick\nbeing in the chair). A hypnotised subject of Dr. Bramwell had\nwhispered into his ear a short, vivid story. On wakening, he was\ngiven a crystal, and asked to describe what he saw therein, when,\nto the astonishment of all, he described the scenery and characters\nof the vivid story which had been whispered into his ear in the\ntrance. He professed to actually see these characters moving across\nthe plane of the crystal as living realities.\nAgain, about thirty years ago, having hypnotised a subject, I told\nhim to look at a certain spot on the wall papering and he would\n\f336 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1908.\nsee a clown. (There was no such figure on the wall papering.) I\nnoticed that every time he looked at the spot he burst out into fits\nof laughter, as if he thoroughly enjoyed what he saw. When asked\nwhat it was, he said he saw a very funny clown on the platform of\na circus, and the clapping audience around him. He heard the jokes\nand was obliged to laugh with the rest. Here you have probably\nsome long forgotten visual impressions\u2014of a circus the man had\nonce been to\u2014reproduced by the mere suggestion of the word\n\"clown,\" the imagination or the memory dressing up the impres\nsion in its old clothing. I am certain it was not from my mind he\nreproduced it, because I had not seen a clown in a circus, and was\nfar more interested in the experiment than in trying to fill in the\nsurroundings of the imaginary clown.\nOnce more, I have reason to know, from personal experience at\nseances, that one's own imagination, playing unchecked (even in a\nstrong mind), can be hallucinated to an extent almost incredible.\nThe subject of the recall of past impressions, and the effects thus\nproduced, is a very fascinating one and worthy of the closest\ninvestigation.\nJ.
